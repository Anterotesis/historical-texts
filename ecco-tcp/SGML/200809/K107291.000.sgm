<HEAD>INTRODUCTION Nece&s;&s;ary to be read.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Age of Doubt and Enquiry, when any Di&s;&s;ention from the Sentiments of the re&s;t of Mankind is e&s;teem'd an In&s;tance of &s;uperior and refin'd Qualifications, it is highly probable that many of our fa&s;hionable Philo&s;ophers will be &s;trangely elated on the Appearance of an E&s;&s;ay of this Kind; and begin to triumph over tho&s;e Set of Men who have Confidence enough in any particular Sy&s;tem, as to think <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> can afford no better or &s;urer way to Virtue and Happine&s;s.&mdash;But however the&s;e People may value them&s;elves for differing from the re&s;t of the World, had the Author of this E&s;&s;ay no other View than to &s;hew him&s;elf in this Light, he would have kept his Sentiments ever to him|&s;elf, &s;ince that Man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a Villain who endeavours to di&s;turb the Means of univer&s;al Happine&s;s, by bringing in Doubt, or confuting any material Point in that Sy&s;tem on which that Happine&s;s depends.&mdash;From a Knowledge of this, the virtuous philo&s;ophic Heathens forbore to un|deceive the World as to the Veracity of their My|thology; For doubtle&s;s in tho&s;e Days of general Ignorance, if their moral Precepts had been &s;trip'd of a religious Reverence, they would have been much le&s;s regarded; as the Difficulty would have been too great for the Philo&s;ophers ever to have per&s;uaded the re&s;t of the World of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Beauty of Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">So if this Age was as much involv'd in Igno|rance as theirs, it would be the highe&s;t Piece of Inju&s;tice to &s;eparate Morality from any one Sy&s;tem of Religion, however fal&s;e and ab&s;urd Rea&s;on might make that Sy&s;tem appear: But while the World abounds, as now it does, with &s;o many thou|&s;ands who are re&s;olv'd to think for them&s;elves, however little capacitated for &s;uch a Ta&s;k; I think it a nece&s;&s;ary Piece of Ju&s;tice ju&s;t to point the Way the Powers of Rea&s;on naturally lead them, le&s;t from a ridiculous De&s;ire of being particular, they run headlong on, and in&s;tead of forming one rational Scheme for their own Satisfaction and Happine&s;s, they u&s;e all their Art to &s;ubvert the Doctrines of Revelation, which can only di&s;turb and perplex others, without bringing the lea&s;t Ad|vantage to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, I think this E&s;&s;ay may be u&s;eful to &s;hew that tho&s;e who have engag'd to &s;up|port the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity by <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> have taken very wrong Steps, as mu&s;t evidently appear when their own Arguments have reduc'd me to the Nece&s;&s;ity of concluding the Soul cannot be im|mortal. To &s;upport &s;uch a Cau&s;e therefore with rational and philo&s;ophical Arguments, is the only way to give its Enemies the Advantage: And if we think the Scripture is the immediate Word of God, what need have we of Rea&s;on to make us be|lieve it; but if we think it is not, then Rea&s;on mu&s;t be our be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Guide.</P>
<P>It is however not at all material, whether the Author of this E&s;&s;ay is directed in his own pri|vate
<PB N="v" REF="5">
Sentiments by Scripture or Rea&s;on, &s;ince all his Arguments are here purely rational; neither doth he intend in the lea&s;t to depreciate the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, well knowing that it is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;incere Chri&s;tian can be at all &s;lagger'd in his Faith by the &s;tronge&s;t Appearances of Rea&s;on; becau&s;e the Chri&s;tian firmly believes that Rea&s;on it&s;elf is a blind and in&s;ufficient Guide to Truth. And tho' an Argument &s;hould appear even to <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Demon&s;tration, he would neverthele&s;s con|demn it as a Piece of Sophi&s;try, and think there was &s;ome un&s;een, unknown Cau&s;e that might at once confute it all.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on therefore cannot affect or endanger the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, when founded on its only true Ba&s;is, the Sy&s;tem of Revelation. But from hence appears the Nece&s;&s;ity that Men &s;hould be altogether Chri&s;tians or Philo&s;ophers, left by en|deavouring to join two &s;uch oppo&s;ite Sy&s;tems, they offend and entangle them&s;elves in both; and in|&s;tead of knowing what <HI>Virtue</HI> is by <HI>Revelation,</HI> or of &s;eeing the Nece&s;&s;ity and Beauty of it by <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> they are hurried from one Opinion to another, and become nothing but Di&s;turbers of the World, <HI>Madmen, Fools,</HI> and at la&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, meer <HI>Athei&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be thought further, that this E&s;&s;ay may be detrimental to the Cau&s;e of Mora|lity, by de&s;troying the Fear of future Puni&s;hments, even among tho&s;e who might be prevail'd on to think and judge rationally.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">It is evident, that religious Precepts, or the Fear of future Ju&s;tiee, will not re&s;train Men from Villainy, el&s;e why are our nece&s;&s;ary and in|di&s;pen&s;able Laws?&mdash;And I &s;hould be very &s;orry to think Mankind were virtuous for no other Cau&s;e than a View of a future Reward for their Actions; or to think Men had &s;o mean an Opi|nion of the wonderful and eternal God, as to imagine he will give them everla&s;ting Happine&s;s for paying him &s;uch a &s;ervile, mercenary Ado|ration, which they would not pay but out of fear of Puni&s;hment, or in hopes of Recompence.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be &s;aid, that the Expectation of future Bli&s;s, whether ju&s;t or no, ought not to be taken away, becau&s;e it &s;erves to comfort the Vir|tuous under Misfortunes, inflicted on them by the Vicious: But is not a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Innocence equal to this? That which <HI>Horace</HI> &s;tiles the bra|zen Wall of the Virtuous, <HI>Nil con&s;ire &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i, null&acirc; palle&s;cere culp&acirc;.</HI> But certain it is that, how|ever Appearances may deceive us, whether Vir|tue has a future Reward or no, it is a &s;ufficient Recompence to it&s;elf in this World.&mdash;However, whether it he thought &s;o or not,&mdash;the Man that &s;huns the common receiv'd Actions of Vice only out of a Dread of Futurity, and not from his na|tural Goodne&s;s of Heart, will find Means to be a Villain, tho' his Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould to that End be forc'd to varni&s;h over the Crime with the mo&s;t &s;acred and religious Colour. So tho' a Man &s;hould &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity and Beauty of Virtue ever &s;o clearly, yet without <HI>Goodne&s;s of Heart</HI> he
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
would find Means to convert even his &s;tronge&s;t Plea of Virtue, into a Rea&s;on for executing his favourite Villainy. And notwith&s;tanding religi|ous Precepts may influence Men to Virtue, equally as well as known philo&s;ophical Truths, yet if they have not a &s;ufficient Share of Goodne&s;s of Heart implanted in their Nature, they will be Villains in &s;pite of both Religion or Philo&s;ophy.&mdash;And as that Man is not a Chri&s;tian or good Man who is only virtuous in Expectation of future Recompence, &s;o that Man is not a Philo&s;opher or a good Man, who doth not find it his Intere&s;t and Happine&s;s to pur&s;ue Virtue, tho' he believes he never &s;hall have a future Reward for his Actions.</P>
<P>Hence then it appears, that no Man has room to be proud of his Virtue; and that the more abandon'd and vitious any Man is, the more he de&s;erves our Pity.&mdash;The Reader may now pro|ceed to the Treati&s;e before him, being only de&s;ir'd to think candidly, and to under&s;tand well before he either di&s;approves or commends the Truth of the Argument.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN ESSAY To Prove,</HI> From the Arguments of the be&s;t Phi|lo&s;ophers, that the <HI>SOUL</HI> of Man <HI>is not,</HI> neither <HI>can it be, IMMORTAL.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> A Definition of the <HI>SOUL,</HI> as given by Philo&s;o|phers, and a Conclu&s;ion of its Immortality drawn from it.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary before we form one Objec|tion to &s;o general an Opinion, as the <HI>Im|mortality of the Soul,</HI> that we &s;hould con|&s;ider how far we agree, as to its e&s;&s;ential Exi&s;tence, with tho&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the late Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> was a Man that expre&s;&s;ed the united Sentiments of the be&s;t Philo&s;ophers, in the mo&s;t intelligent and per&s;picuous Manner, and was be&s;ide as &s;trenuous a Profe&s;&s;or of the Soul's <HI>Immortality</HI> as any Man; I hope I &s;hall not be accu&s;ed of unfair Dealing, for rea&s;oning upon his Definitions and Arguments, with|out introducing and reconciling the more ab&s;tru&s;e A&s;&s;er|tions of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers from whence he has drawn tho&s;e Definitions; the Truth of which, their Arguments however varied, concur to maintain.</NOTE>, who &s;upport this important Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then&mdash;We allow that the Soul is an intellectual Being, not at all &s;ubject to the Ac|cidents and Properties of Matter, in general; &s;uch as Solidity, Exten&s;ion, Contraction, Ex|pan&s;ion, or any Quality whereby it is render'd local <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to that nice Di&s;tinction, made by &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, in &s;aying that Spirit has <HI>Ubiety</HI> but not <HI>Locality,</HI>&mdash;or that it may be <HI>&s;omewhere</HI> and yet be in <HI>no Place,</HI> I e&s;teem it mighty ridiculous, as having no real Meaning at all in it.</NOTE>, or in a Capacity to take up the lea&s;t or the mo&s;t infinite Space.</P>
<P N="2">II. That this intellectual Being is acting on, only, a particular Part of Matter, <HI>i. e. the Body,</HI> by certain inexplicable Means, as utterly unknown to us as the Means how the <HI>Planets</HI> act in their <HI>Orbits,</HI> by wonderful Dependen|cies on their proper Centers of <HI>Gravitation</HI>; all which we can attribute to nothing but the Will of the <HI>Great Creator,</HI> from whom they have received &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Laws as are &s;tiled the <HI>Laws of Nature.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That the <HI>Soul</HI> is nothing but that Power in Man, or rather acting on the Body of Man, that enables him to <HI>perceive,</HI> to <HI>re|flect</HI> and to <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. That the <HI>Soul</HI> is a perpetual or con|&s;tant Power of Thinking, and that upon its
<PB N="3" REF="11">
cea&s;ing to be <HI>active</HI> it mu&s;t immediately cea&s;e to <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>It is from the&s;e &s;tated Principles that a <HI>late Philo&s;opher,</HI> who (if we &s;et a&s;ide his irrational Attachment to &s;ome particular Sy&s;tems) had of all Mankind the greate&s;t Per&s;picuity and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Rea&s;oning, draws the&s;e two <HI>Co|rollaries.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t.
<Q>That the <HI>Soul</HI> is in its own Nature <HI>immortal</HI>; for nothing but the Power which hath given it this active Life and Being can de&s;troy it: It is entirely out of the Reach of the material World to hurt it: It cannot lay a&s;ide its own Thinking, it cannot put it&s;elf out of Being: Nor can we conceive how any other Spirit can make it cea&s;e to act, <HI>i. e.</HI> cea&s;e to be: Such an active Being as a Spirit cannot be de&s;troy'd but by Annihilation; and &s;urely <HI>God,</HI> who&s;e Right and Prerogative it is to create or give Being to a Creature, hath not put it into the Power of any Creature to annihilate his Works, or take away their Being.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2dly.
<Q>That, when the human Body dies, the <HI>Soul</HI> exi&s;ts and continues to think and act in a &s;eparate State: And, when it is freed from all the Avocations of Sen&s;a|tions of &s;en&s;ible Things, it will live more entirely in the Reflexion on its own Ope|rations, and will commence a State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, according to its own former Conduct; either rejoicing in the
<PB N="4" REF="12">
Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, or under inward Angui&s;h and bitter Self-Reproaches, from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own Guilt.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps this Author, from an earne&s;t Per|&s;ua&s;ion of the Truth of his A&s;&s;ertions, drew the&s;e Conclu&s;ions before his Argument had gained &s;ufficient Ground for &s;uch weighty Inferences: For, upon &s;umming up the Evi|dence of his Rea&s;ons, we find he is obliged to u&s;e his not <HI>being able to conceive how one Spirit can be &s;o prevalent as to annihilate an|other,</HI> as a Proof of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it.</P>
<P>Hence, we might conclude, that our Au|thor could not conceive how God him&s;elf, who is a Spirit, could annihilate the Soul; but if this is not his Meaning, as certainly we mu&s;t infer it is not, from what he &s;ays pre|ceding, <HI>that it is in the Power of no</HI> other <HI>Being to de&s;troy it</HI>; by which he mu&s;t imply, that it is in the Power of <HI>God</HI> to de&s;troy it;&mdash;it is needle&s;s then to &s;ay, <HI>&s;urely God has not impowered</HI> any of his Creatures to annihi|late his Works; before we have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to conclude, that the <HI>Creator him&s;elf</HI> will not put an end to them. Thus what doth it argue in <HI>Favour</HI> of the Soul's <HI>Immor|tality,</HI> to &s;ay no Creature or Power but God can annihilate the Soul, before we have proved that <HI>God him&s;elf</HI> will not de&s;troy it, on the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he has not created the Soul of &s;uch a Nature, that it cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="5" REF="13">
Organs of the Body. Here then is the Point to be di&s;puted on; for, as to the &s;econd Corollary, it is nothing more than a pretty rational Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t; and if the fir&s;t is prov'd of <HI>no Force,</HI> that of it&s;elf mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall.</P>
<P>But before we proceed immediately to ex|amine the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the above Inferences, let us take a little Notice of the <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> of this Opinion of the <HI>Soul's Immortality,</HI> be|cau&s;e many have taken this as a pre&s;umptive Proof of its Veracity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The Univer&s;ality of the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality con&s;ider'd; its Foundation and in&s;ufficient Con&s;equence.</HEAD>
<P>NOT only the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of every Sect, the <HI>Mahometan</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Be|lievers, but the unletter'd <HI>Indians</HI> have, as it were naturally implanted, this Sentiment in their Minds; and the latter, very rationally (tho' &s;o often laugh'd at and exploded a Con|ceit) believes al&s;o, that his Dog &s;hall keep Company with his Ma&s;ter in the Regions of Immortality.</P>
<P>Let us examine then whether this is an in|nate Idea, explicitly wrought into the Na|ture of the Soul of Man, and born with us;
<PB N="6" REF="14">
or whether it be an Idea formed in the Soul, by its Reflexion on it&s;elf, or if it be not an Idea communicated to the Soul, in its Com|munion or Conver&s;e with Souls of the &s;ame Nature; which Conver&s;e, it is plain our Souls hold together when they acquaint each other with our Thoughts, by the Means of Sen&s;ation. Now if we could conclude it of the former Nature, there might &s;eem &s;ome plau&s;ible Rea&s;on for thinking it a <HI>pre&s;umptive Proof</HI> of the <HI>Soul's Immortality,</HI> and e&s;teem|ing it a Sort of an Evidence given us by our Creator: But we cannot conclude it &s;uch an innate Idea, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has manife&s;tly di&s;proved the Po&s;&s;ibility of there being any &s;uch innate Ideas implanted in the Soul; but proves that all Ideas mu&s;t be formed by Re|flection or Rea&s;on, <HI>that is,</HI> by the Soul's acting on it&s;elf. Now, in this Ca&s;e, it is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that the Soul &s;hould be in a Capacity of forming a ju&s;t Judgment on &s;o ab&s;tru&s;e a Point, at a Time when it is almo&s;t incapable of forming any very rational Ideas of Things daily occurring to the Sen&s;es: For I imagine no Body can tell how they fir&s;t im|bibed the Notion of the Soul's Immortality: But if there be &s;ome who can, they can ea&s;ily a&s;certain whether it is an Idea form'd in the Mind by Reflection, or whether it is not (as I conclude it is) an Opinion communicated to the Soul with its earlie&s;t Notions of Mo|rality: And therefore &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="7" REF="15">
the Tenderne&s;s of the Mind, when no Act of Rea&s;on was powerful enough to with&s;tand the Impre&s;&s;ion, or to judge of the Truth of &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion; that it requires all the Efforts of Rea&s;on, afterwards, to eradi|cate it.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s Doctrine of <HI>innate I|deas</HI>&mdash;I believe none will contend, that the Sy&s;tem of Immortality is &s;o con&s;onant with the Nature, Frame, and Make of the ratio|nal Mind, as that <HI>two and two make four</HI>&mdash;a Part <HI>is le&s;s than the</HI> Whole, and other Axioms according to which the rational Mind, of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t and will judge, and therefore, the&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Watts,</HI> may be called innate Ideas.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophical Antients, it is true, be|lieved, as much as the Moderns, a future Exi&s;tence of the Soul; of which, <HI>Socrates</HI> was a noble In&s;tance: But their Ideas &s;eem plainly to have ari&s;en from their ab&s;tracted Notions of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice,</HI> and the Nece&s;|&s;ity, they imagin'd, of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments; and tho' this Circum&s;tance makes &s;trongly for the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> yet there appears no Proof of &s;uch a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI>; &s;ince they them&s;elves allowed that <HI>Virtue</HI> was its <HI>own Reward,</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> its <HI>own Puni&s;hment</HI>; the one rendering Man|kind happy, and the other occa&s;ioning them to be mi&s;erable, even in this World. But this we will con&s;ider pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">You will &s;ay then, Whence aro&s;e this Idea at fir&s;t? Even &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been communicated from Father to Son ever &s;ince the Beginning (if ever there was a Begin|ning, as in all Probability there was) of Man's Exi&s;tence&mdash;it mu&s;t then of Nece&s;&s;ity be ei|ther explicitly implanted in the Soul, or the Effect of the Soul's acting on it&s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> of Rea&s;on or Reflection.</P>
<P>To this I &s;ay,&mdash;it is probable that a Man, who had never heard of the Soul's being im|mortal, might neverthele&s;s be of that Opi|nion: Yet this Belief is occa&s;ioned more by the <HI>Will</HI> influencing, or as it were <HI>bribing,</HI> the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &s;o to conclude, than from the na|tural Power of judging of Truth, which is e&s;&s;ential to the Soul. For, from the Plea|&s;ure ari&s;ing from our own Ideas, it is natural for the Soul to will or de&s;ire never to be robb'd of that Plea&s;ure which mu&s;t cea&s;e in its Non-Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But here you will &s;ay, perhaps, <HI>the Rea|&s;on is not &s;ubject to the Will, but the Will to Rea&s;on.</HI> For you cannot perceive or think what you will.&mdash;This is true.&mdash;Yet tho' the <HI>Will</HI> is not the Director of Rea&s;on, it can, and plainly doth, impo&s;e fal&s;e and &s;pecious Propo&s;itions on the Judgment in favour of its own Cau&s;e; and the Conclu&s;ion form'd by the Judgment, in Con&s;equence of the&s;e, is called, <HI>Partiality:</HI> For the <HI>Power of Rea|&s;on,</HI>

in it&s;elf, will from all Propo&s;itions judge impartially.</P>
<P>Here comes the Difficulty of per&s;uading People to what they are unwilling to believe; and the ea&s;y Concurrence to the Belief of any thing by People impartial and unbias'd: And this the Divines are &s;en&s;ible of, when they &s;ay, there is more Hopes of converting a Man of no Religion at all, than of a bi|gotted Heretick.</P>
<P>Now that all, or the greate&s;t Part of Man|kind, &s;eem to have the De&s;ire of Immorta|lity, is plain; and we may ju&s;tly a&s;k, as <HI>Cato</HI> is repre&s;ented &s;aying,
<Q><L>Whence is this plea&s;ing Hope, this fond De&s;ire,</L>
<L>This longing after Immortality?</L>
<L>Or whence this &s;ecret Dread and inward Horror</L>
<L>Of falling into nought? Why &s;hrinks the Soul</L>
<L>Back on her&s;elf, and &s;tartles at De&s;truction?</L></Q></P>
<P>From whence he infers,
<Q><L>'Tis the Divinity that &s;tirs within us;</L>
<L>'Tis Heav'n it&s;elf that points out an hereafter,</L>
<L>And intimates Eternity to Man.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this Inference is not evident; neither is our De&s;ire of a future Exi&s;tence any Proof at all of it; unle&s;s the Ca&s;e is fairly &s;tated before tho&s;e Powers of Rea&s;on, whereby we naturally and infallibly judge of Truth; and they join to direct the <HI>Will,</HI> to maintain and &s;upport that Doctrine. For it is plain that the
<PB N="10" REF="18">
Will, when not acting from this innate Knowledge of Truth, or the innate Cau&s;e of Virtue (of which we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) directs us oftentimes to Things &s;tupid, fal&s;e, and immoral. Hence it is evident, that the mo&s;t firm Belief in Man, ari&s;ing from his own Reflections of a future Exi&s;tence, is ex|actly the &s;ame with the Belief of a Man in the following Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Man had a Friend whom he lov'd as him&s;elf, and it &s;hould be told him, by one who&s;e Word equally might or might not be depended on, that a mo&s;t <HI>uncommon</HI> Misfortune had happen'd to this Friend.&mdash; Now his being <HI>unwilling</HI> that &s;uch a Thing <HI>&s;hould be,</HI> would immediately awake all the Rea&s;ons or Cau&s;es he could think of, to en|courage him to conclude, that it really <HI>was not</HI>; and if, upon examining all that &s;hould occur, he finds no Ju&s;tice to think the <HI>Pro|bability</HI> or the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of <HI>&s;uch a Misfortune,</HI> will he not believe is Friend is &s;afe?&mdash;Un|doubtedly he will.&mdash;But is this Belief a Proof that he is &s;o?&mdash;Certainly no; for after all, there may be a Cau&s;e, which thro' the Per|plexity of his Hopes and Fears, never ap|pear'd in a ju&s;t Light to his Rea&s;on, or per|haps was never &s;ugge&s;ted, or perhaps a Cau&s;e that he did not know exi&s;ted in Nature, which may have occa&s;ion'd &s;uch a Misfor|tune, and which Cau&s;e, when he comes to be &s;en&s;ible of, he will no longer doubt of
<PB N="11" REF="19">
the Truth of &s;uch an Effect, and of his Friend's Misfortune.</P>
<P>So tho' a Man, out of a De&s;ire of being immortal, may think he has ever &s;o many Rea&s;ons to believe it; yet if afterwards he becomes &s;en&s;ible of a Cau&s;e why it cannot be &s;o, that Power of Rea&s;on whereby he judges of Truth, will infallibly convince him of it: And the only Cau&s;e that makes a Man remain not convinc'd by a <HI>ju&s;t Argument</HI> is, that he either wants Capacity or Penetration to under&s;tand the Ju&s;tice of its Propo&s;itions: For it is plain, if a Man &s;ees and knows <HI>two</HI> and <HI>two</HI> are added together, that he mu&s;t conclude the Sum is <HI>four.</HI></P>
<P>But to apply the foregoing Suppo&s;ition to the Effects of the <HI>Prejudice of Education.</HI> Suppo&s;e a Man in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances was told of a Misfortune befalling his Friend by a thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es, who&s;e Veracity in other Re&s;pects he had Rea&s;on to depend on; or even tho' &s;ome of them were the greate&s;t Lyars, yet they being all in the &s;ame Story, would he form one Doubt of the Truth of it, even tho' he &s;aw no Rea&s;on to believe it? &mdash;Certainly no; or if he did, his Belief and his Doubts would be of the &s;ame Kind ex|actly, as that which a Man entertains con|cerning the Immortality of the Soul, that has been told of it a thou&s;and Times, by a thou&s;and People, and has never impartially examin'd the Probability or Po&s;&s;ibility of the
<PB N="12" REF="20">
Truth of &s;uch a Belief.&mdash;Here then is, I think, clearly demon&s;trated the <HI>Source</HI> of the Opinion concerning the Soul of <HI>Man being immortal</HI>; and it is plain from it, that we may ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>the Univer&s;ality of that Belief, is not the lea&s;t Proof of the Truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>Now we will con&s;ider then, fir&s;t, the Vali|dity of the Proofs brought by the above-quot|ed Philo&s;opher of the Doctrine in di&s;pute, and then examine the Rea&s;ons that may be given to think &s;uch an Immortality nece&s;&s;ary, and then proceed to give other Rea&s;ons for thinking there is no &s;uch a Nece&s;&s;ity, and for our believing the Soul incapable of ex|i&s;ting after the Decea&s;e of the Body.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Proofs of the Immortality of the Soul examined.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, then, <HI>the Soul</HI> is <HI>immortal,</HI> &s;ays our Philo&s;opher, <HI>becau&s;e nothing but the Power which hath given it this active</HI> Life and Being, <HI>can de&s;troy it.</HI></P>
<P>This Rea&s;on, granting it true, has no Weight at all relating to the A&s;&s;ertion, un|le&s;s it had been before prov'd, that the Au|thor of the Soul's Being <HI>would</HI> not de&s;troy it; which is the mo&s;t material Point in que|&s;tion: And this is what this Philo&s;opher has omitted to mention, as if the divine <HI>Volition</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="21">
or <HI>Will</HI> was le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary or le&s;s doubtful in this Ca&s;e, than that <HI>Power</HI> which is only the Con&s;equence of that <HI>Volition.</HI> But as this Sugge&s;tion would have quite di&s;concerted his Hypothe&s;is, he has &s;umm'd up the Cau&s;e without it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>It is entirely out of the Reach of the material World to hurt it.</HI></P>
<P>If our Author here means, <HI>that the Soul (as a Power not at all &s;ubject to Matter's Pro|perties, as at fir&s;t allow'd) cannot be affected by Matter in it&s;elf con&s;ider'd as a Sub&s;tance that has no Power at all,</HI> his A&s;&s;ertion is as ridiculous and as childi&s;h, as 'twould be to &s;ay, if <HI>any Thing is out of our Reach, we can't reach it.</HI> But if he means, as he certainly does, that the <HI>Soul,</HI> con&s;ider'd as a Power and an exi&s;tent Being in it&s;elf, cannot be affected by that Power, which acts upon all Matter in general in &s;ome Degree or other, and is call'd the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> I mu&s;t en|ter a little into the Truth of his A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Soul ab&s;tracted from the Body, as having nothing at all to do with <HI>Matter,</HI> we may then &s;ay, neither <HI>Matter,</HI> or the Powers acting upon <HI>Matter in general,</HI> can affect it. But if we con&s;ider the Soul acting in conjunction with the Body, it may, and will, be affected by the <HI>Power</HI> acting upon Matter in general, by Means peculiar to that Part of Matter or Body to which it is united; <HI>that is,</HI> on which it acts: As if
<PB N="14" REF="22">
a Stone &s;hould fall on my Head, the Power acting on the Stone would, by means of the Organs of Sen&s;ation, affect my Soul.</P>
<P>The &s;ame in Ca&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, broken Limbs, and the like, the Soul is affected with extream Pain, which without, the Soul would not be felt; and this Pain mu&s;t pro|ceed from &s;ome Cau&s;e to which Matter in general is &s;ubjected, as no Man has a Pain peculiar to him&s;elf; but it is po&s;&s;ible a Man of the &s;ame Con&s;truction may be liable to it as well as he. It is true, indeed, he becomes &s;en&s;ible of this Power acting upon Matter in general, by the Means of Sen&s;ation iden|tically particular to him&s;elf; for one Man doth not feel the Pain of another, as each is affected with his own.</P>
<P>Now there are In&s;tances of the rational Faculties being impair'd and render'd u&s;ele&s;s to the nece&s;&s;ary Offices of Life, from the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Body: As in Ca&s;es of Luna|cy; at which Time the <HI>&s;en&s;ative Faculties,</HI> or the <HI>Powers of Sen&s;ation,</HI> which are more immediately acting on the Body, &s;eem much le&s;s affected than the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or the <HI>Soul's Power of acting upon it&s;elf:</HI> Since a <HI>Lunatic,</HI> that cannot <HI>remember, reflect</HI> or <HI>judge,</HI> is often very &s;en&s;ible that he <HI>&s;ees, hears</HI> and <HI>feels.</HI></P>
<P>Now if the Soul is &s;o liable to be affect|ed, even in that Part in which it is &s;aid its Immortality con&s;i&s;ts, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>acting upon it&s;elf,</HI> by the &s;lighter Accidents of the Body;
<PB N="15" REF="23">
&s;urely, when the Body receives the Shock of Death, when the Blood cea&s;es to flow, the Eyes to &s;ee, the Ears to hear, and all the whole Body to move, certainly the Soul mu&s;t be &s;o affected as to <HI>cea&s;e altogether to be.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee a Man wounded and maim'd, &s;o that he cannot &s;upport him&s;elf; yet may &s;o recover, as to be as u&s;eful and agreeable to him&s;elf and others as before:&mdash;We &s;ee a Lunatic, oftentimes, entirely incapable of rea&s;oning, yet may be &s;o re&s;tor'd, as to re|flect and judge as nicely and ju&s;tly as ever.</P>
<P>Again: A Man may be &s;o wounded, or by Di&s;ea&s;es render'd incapable of putting his Limbs to their former U&s;e, but mu&s;t be forc'd to &s;upport an in&s;ufficient Body till it drops into the Grave. The Soul of a Lunatic may be &s;o affected, that it &s;hall &s;upport the In|&s;ufficiency of Rea&s;on till it <HI>&s;hall we not &s;ay,</HI> till it cea&s;es to act at all; con&s;equently <HI>cea&s;es to be.</HI></P>
<P>For if it is allow'd that tho&s;e Powers of the Soul, which are call'd the Powers of <HI>Sen&s;ation,</HI> immediately become inactive when the Body dies, according to the &s;econd Co|rollary, <HI>the Soul, in a &s;eperate State, is freed from all the Avocations of Sen&s;ations and &s;en|&s;ible Things,</HI> &amp;c. And if it is evident, as I have prov'd it is, that the <HI>Power of the Soul's acting on it&s;elf,</HI> is full as <HI>&s;ubject</HI> to be <HI>affected</HI> by Accidents peculiar to Matter, as the <HI>Power
<PB N="16" REF="24">
of Sen&s;ation is,</HI> have we the lea&s;t <HI>Shadow of Rea&s;on</HI> to infer, that the <HI>Powers of Reflection</HI> can exi&s;t without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Body, any more than the <HI>Powers of Sen&s;ation?</HI> I think not.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, perhaps, this is no de|mon&s;trative Proof. Well, tho' it be not, and we &s;hould allow, in favour of this Arti|cle, that it is out of the Power of the whole <HI>material World,</HI> or the Power acting upon all <HI>Matter,</HI> to hurt the <HI>Soul,</HI> con&s;ider'd &s;e|perate from the Body; yet we mu&s;t fir&s;t know that it can exi&s;t in this Seperation, before we allow this a Rea&s;on for its Im|mortality. <HI>(In other Words)</HI>&mdash;We mu&s;t know the Soul's Immortality from &s;ome other Cau&s;e, for this is an Argument of no Moment at all.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>It cannot lay a&s;ide its own thinking; it cannot put it&s;elf out of Being.</HI></P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible for a Man to take a Pi&s;tol and &s;hoot out his Brains, by which Action he at once <HI>annihilates</HI> the Powers of Sen&s;a|tion, no incon&s;iderable E&s;&s;ence of the Soul: But whether the Soul is altogether render'd inactive by Death or no, this A&s;&s;ertion of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Soul being able to de&s;troy it&s;elf, is no Rea&s;on to conclude its Immortality; unle&s;s you will &s;ay, that a Man's being unable to walk, is a Proof he never &s;hall depart from the Spot he is in,
<PB N="17" REF="25">
before you have prov'd the Impo&s;&s;ibility of his being carried.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>We cannot conceive</HI> how <HI>any other Spirit can make the Soul cea&s;e to act,</HI> i. e. <HI>cea&s;e to be.</HI></P>
<P>This is the lea&s;t of a Rea&s;on that can po&s;|&s;ibly be given: For if our not conceiving how any thing <HI>could be,</HI> is a Rea&s;on why it <HI>is not</HI> or <HI>cannot</HI> be, we have the &s;ame Rea|&s;on to conclude that the Soul and Body do not act in Conjunction, becau&s;e we cannot conceive <HI>by what Means</HI>; tho' we have daily &s;uch evident Demon&s;trations of the Veracity of &s;uch mutual acting.</P>
<P>The&s;e then are the great Proofs of our Philo&s;opher, deduc'd from the be&s;t and mo&s;t rational Arguments of his own, and of others, in favour of the Immortality of the Soul.</P>
<P>We will now examine the Rea&s;ons that may be given to think &s;uch an Immortality nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Rea&s;ons to think the Immortality of the Soul nece&s;&s;ary.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>IT may be thought nece&s;&s;ary, to the Ho|nour and Wi&s;dom of our great Crea|tor, that a Soul, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of rational Faculties in &s;o high a Degree, and capable of &s;uch ex|traordinary
<PB N="18" REF="26">
Attainments, &s;hould be continued longer in Being, than the &s;hort Space of Time allotted for the Life of the Body.</HI></P>
<P>As to this, we are incapable of forming any true Judgment of tho&s;e high, noble, and extraordinary Attainments we may imagine the Soul po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of: For nothing is high, great, or noble but by Compari&s;on; and as we are &s;o ignorant of the e&s;&s;ential Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Deity,</HI> we cannot form any ju&s;t Idea of what Con&s;equence we are of, in re&s;pect to its wonderful and incomprehen&s;ible Nature.</P>
<P>It is therefore highly probable, that we entertain a much greater Opinion of our Be|ings, than is &s;trictly con&s;onant to the Nature of Things, and the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>This Suppo&s;ition then, argues nothing of a Nece&s;&s;ity for the Immortality of the Soul.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>It may be thought nece&s;&s;ary from the &s;eeming Nece&s;&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</HI></P>
<P>This has, for many Ages, been e&s;teem'd, by the Rationali&s;ts of almo&s;t all Per&s;ua&s;ions, as a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to expect, if not an ab|&s;olute Proof of, a future State:&mdash;We will therefore con&s;ider it very impartially.</P>
<P>This Principle can have no other &s;olid Foundation than the ab&s;tracted Notions of Virtue and Vice; for if our Actions were neither Good or Evil, where is the Nece&s;&s;ity of Rewards or Puni&s;hments? We mu&s;t then,
<PB N="19" REF="27">
fir&s;t, con&s;ider what is <HI>Virtue</HI> and what its oppo&s;ite, <HI>Vice.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. V.</HI> Virtue and Vice, their Foundation and E&s;&s;ence examin'd.</HEAD>
<P>THERE has been nothing, in all the Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophers, &s;o much con|te&s;ted as this.&mdash;<HI>What are Virtue and Vice?</HI> &mdash;The Man of Faith will tell me, that it is plainly reveal'd in the <HI>Word of God,</HI> the only true Standard of Wrong and Right.</P>
<P>Now I think it ab&s;urd to imagine, that the great Creator permitted Mankind to act for &s;o many hundred Years, as, according to chrono|logical Account, were elaps'd before the Bible was wrote, without a ju&s;t Standard for their Actions. But be that as it will.&mdash;I allow that the Sy&s;tem of Morality, to be found in the &s;a|cred Writings, ab&s;tracted from that Heap of Ab&s;urdities wherewith it is inculcated, is a Sy&s;tem as truly perfect, ju&s;t and noble, as is to be met with in any Writings whatever. Yet &s;hall we not think this rather the Sy&s;tem of the philo&s;ophic Heathens improv'd, than a new one immediately reveal'd to us from our Creator.</P>
<P>What are more noble and ju&s;t (according to our Notions of Ju&s;tice) than the Senti|ments deliver'd under that allegorical Heap
<PB N="20" REF="28">
of Ab&s;urdities in the Heathen Theology; and it is evident, the&s;e Sentiments were as capable of influencing moral Practices: For where have we had one In&s;tance of a <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> being a <HI>better Man</HI> than <HI>Socrates?</HI>&mdash; Shall we not think then, that the&s;e two Sy|&s;tems of Morality &s;pring from the &s;ame Source in the rational Mind? And &s;hall we not ca&s;t a&s;ide the Heap of Ab&s;urdities taught us by <HI>Revelation,</HI> as <HI>Socrates, Plato,</HI> and other Philo&s;ophers of tho&s;e Days, did tho&s;e of the antient <HI>Mythology</HI>; which, neverthele&s;s, were as much and as <HI>literally</HI> believ'd by tho&s;e who were incapable of thinking <HI>then,</HI> as the Scriptures by the Generality of Chri&s;tians are <HI>now?</HI></P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible the Man of Faith may &s;ee no manner of Rea&s;on in all this: I &s;hall there|fore leave him to the Vanity of his own Imagination, and confine my Di&s;cour&s;e to the Man of Rea&s;on, who is the only ju&s;t Di&s;putant.</P>
<P>We will examine then fir&s;t what <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> appear to be, and then proceed to con&s;ider their Cau&s;e or Foundation.</P>
<P>As to the former, it will be needle&s;s for me to enter into the Subject in my own Words, when it is already &s;o ju&s;tly expre&s;s'd, and &s;o clearly demon&s;trated by the truly in|genious Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> who, in his <HI>&s;econd E&s;&s;ay on the Characteri&s;tics,</HI> after having fully prov'd the Imperfection of the Definitions of Virtue,
<PB N="21" REF="29">
laid down by <HI>Clarke, Wolla&s;ton,</HI> and Lord <HI>Shafte&s;bury,</HI> a&s;&s;erts&mdash;<HI>That</HI> Happine&s;s <HI>is the la&s;t Criterion or Te&s;t, to which the moral Beauty, Truth, or Rectitude of our Affections is to be re|ferred,</HI> which he thus demon&s;trates, by two Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1.
<Q>Tho&s;e very Affections and Actions, which in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things are approved of as Virtues, do change their Nature and become vicious, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, when they contradict this fundamen|tal Law of the <HI>greate&s;t public Happine&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus, altho' in general, it is a Parent's Duty to prefer a Child's Welfare to that of another Per&s;on, yet if this natural and ju&s;t Affection gain &s;uch Strength, as to tempt the Parent to violate the <HI>public</HI> for his Child's <HI>particular</HI> Welfare, what was be|fore a Duty, by this becomes immoderate and criminal.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>Actions which are, in their own Na|ture mo&s;t &s;hocking to every humane Af|fection, lo&s;e at once their moral Defor|mity, when they become &s;ub&s;ervient to the general Welfare, and a&s;&s;ume both the Name and Nature of Virtue. For what is more contrary to every gentle and kind Af|fection of the human Brea&s;t, than to take away the Life of a Man: Yet, when the Nece&s;&s;ity of public Example compels us to make a Sacrifice of this Kind, tho' we may lament the Occa&s;ion, we cannot con|demn
<PB N="22" REF="30">
the Fact: So far are we from brand|ing it as Murder that we approve it as Ju&s;|tice, and always defend it on this great Principle alone, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>the public Good.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence, therefore, we may obtain a ju&s;t and adequate Definition of <HI>Virtue,</HI> which is no other, than <HI>the Conformity of our Af|fections with the public Good,</HI> or <HI>the volun|tary Production of the greate&s;t Happine&s;s.</HI></Q>
Whoever will read this Author's whole E&s;|&s;ay, will &s;ee with what Ju&s;tne&s;s he proceeds to this Definition of Virtue.</P>
<P>We will go on now to con&s;ider the Founda|tion or Source of Virtue in the rational Mind.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> allows, that the Foundation of moral Virtue is naturally implanted in the Soul of Man; and that this Foundation is the <HI>innate Knowledge of Truth,</HI> which is e&s;|&s;ential to the Soul: For hence it is, &s;ays he, that the Soul rationally judges of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> of <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Unfitne&s;s</HI>&mdash;that <HI>two</HI> and <HI>two</HI> make <HI>four</HI>&mdash;that when a Globe is fitted into an exact round Ca&s;e, there is a Fitne&s;s of tho&s;e Things to each other; and then proceeds to &s;ay, that thus the Soul ra|tionally concludes, <HI>Contracts are rather to be kept than broken.</HI> Now, &s;uppo&s;ing that by the &s;ame Rule that, <HI>two and two make four,</HI> we &s;hould &s;ee that <HI>Contracts are rather to be kept than broken</HI>; yet if the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of pro|moting Happine&s;s, as has been proved, is <HI>Virtue</HI> and Happine&s;s the <HI>Effect</HI> of it; we
<PB N="23" REF="31">
&s;hould, in this Ca&s;e, often find that keeping &s;ome Sort of Contracts, ra&s;hly and incon&s;i|derately made, would render mi&s;erable all the Parties engaged in it, and be not at all in&s;trumental to the <HI>public Good:</HI> And there|fore <HI>breaking</HI> &s;uch a Contract would be a Means of Happine&s;s, and as every Means to <HI>mutual Happine&s;s</HI> is <HI>Virtue,</HI> even <HI>acting</HI> ac|cording to <HI>Truth</HI> would then be <HI>Vice.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee then here is an evident Proof of the Fal&s;ity of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> adjudging the Foun|dation of <HI>Virtue</HI> to the <HI>innate Knowledge of Truth,</HI> as well as of Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI>'s Defini|tion of <HI>Virtue</HI>; who affirms, that
<Q>no Act whether Word or Deed of any Being, to whom moral Good and Evil are imputable, that interferes with any true Propo&s;ition, or <HI>denies</HI> any Thing <HI>to be as it is,</HI> can be right. That, on the Contrary, every Act is right, which does not contradict Truth; but treats every Thing as being what it is.</Q></P>
<P>But I refer the Reader to Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> to &s;ee a beautiful and fair Confutation of that Definition; and conclude that, however e&s;|&s;ential the Knowledge of Truth is to the Soul, it is that Faculty of the Soul which <HI>Watts</HI> calls <HI>pathetic In&s;tinct</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition toward Goodne&s;s,</HI> and what I term <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Heart,</HI> and not the <HI>Knowledge of Truth</HI> that is the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of moral Virtue: And of this, as <HI>Watts</HI> ob&s;erves, there are &s;ome few In&s;tances in mo&s;t Per&s;ons, which appear
<PB N="24" REF="32">
chiefly in the working of Benevolence and Compa&s;&s;ion in us towards <HI>&s;en&s;ible Creatures, inward Aver&s;ions</HI> to <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and perhaps, &s;ays he, a natural Reverence to that Almighty Power, whom we call God, when we come to know him.</P>
<P>Neither is it any ways more accountable how more or le&s;s of this Di&s;po&s;ition is im|planted in each Individual of Mankind, than it is by what Means one Man has more or le&s;s the Capacity of Rea&s;oning, Genius, or elevated Ideas than another.</P>
<P>Now if from this Source ari&s;es moral Vir|tue, every Man will be naturally more or le&s;s virtuous, as he has more or le&s;s <HI>Good|ne&s;s of Heart</HI> naturally implanted in him: And tho' &s;ome Men, who may perhaps have but little of this innate Principle, may do Actions tending to the Happine&s;s of their Fellow-Creatures, either from the Influence of moral Precepts, imagining thereby to ac|quire the Favour of their Creator, or out of Fear of what they are told are the Con&s;e|quences of Vice; and tho' others, entirely di&s;regarding every Sentiment of this Kind, and deaf to whatever little they have of this natural Goodne&s;s, go on to the greate&s;t Lengths in Actions that render the World mi&s;erable; yet this does not at all hinder us from rationally fixing here the Foundation of Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="33">And if acting from this innate Principle of Goodne&s;s or De&s;ire of prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting univer&s;al Happine&s;s be Virtue, acting from the im|mediate Want of it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be Vice.</P>
<P>Now, where is the Ju&s;tice or Nece&s;&s;ity that Men &s;hould be puni&s;hed or rewarded, for acting from Principles which they nei|ther gave them&s;elves, nor can po&s;&s;ibly dive&s;t them&s;elves of?</P>
<P>For if the Soul can dive&s;t it&s;elf of this In&s;tinct or Faculty, why cannot it dive&s;t it|&s;elf of all its other Faculties, and &s;o annihi|late it&s;elf?&mdash;Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> allows that the Soul cannot think otherwi&s;e than that <HI>two and two make four &mdash;a Part is le&s;s than</HI> the Whole, and &s;uch like.&mdash;Now is this innate Idea, <HI>the Knowledge of Truth,</HI> of more Con&s;equence, or le&s;s ea&s;y for the Soul to dive&s;t it&s;elf of, than that great Spring from which our Hap|pine&s;s evidently derives? I think it &s;hould not be thought &s;o &mdash; for it appears that this Knowledge of Truth doth not immediately occa&s;ion us to do Good or Ill, but acts &s;ub|&s;ervient to our De&s;ire of promoting Happi|ne&s;s, by forming Propo&s;itions of the Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s of Things; whereby the Soul becomes &s;en&s;ible when to exert that In&s;tinct, it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, in favour of Virtue. So that we &s;ee this innate Knowledge of Truth is a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> and not the <HI>primary</HI> Cau&s;e of moral Virtue, only a&s;&s;i&s;ting the natural Di&s;|po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s in its Offices.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34">But here it may be objected&mdash;<HI>That the Soul may be</HI> dive&s;ted <HI>of this Faculty or Di&s;po|&s;ition, for there are many Men, who have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great Share of it; who, by be|coming familiar to inhuman Sights and Deeds of Cruelty, have lo&s;t a great deal of this Di&s;|po&s;ition: As is evident, in</HI> Surgeons, Butchers, <HI>and the like. So that tho&s;e, who at fir&s;t might be almo&s;t ready to &s;woon at the Amputation of a Limb, or at the Death of a Sheep, &s;hall, after &s;ome Time, think no more of the Cruelty of their Profe&s;&s;ion than tho&s;e who&s;e Concerns are with inanimate Things.</HI></P>
<P>Now, however plau&s;ible this Objection may &s;eem, it is neverthele&s;s fal&s;e; for they have not a jot le&s;s of this natural Di&s;po&s;ition in them, than before they ever practi&s;ed tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions: And it is only that innate <HI>Knowledge of Truth,</HI> whereby they judge of the Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s of Things, that is <HI>vitiated</HI> or mi&s;led by a Practice, the Nece&s;|&s;ity of which impo&s;es &s;pecious Propo&s;itions on the Mind, from which their Rea&s;on con|cludes, that this In&s;tinct or innate Goodne&s;s of Heart need not be exerted on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and thus from being accu&s;tomed to the Sights and Actions of Cruelty, without feeling an unea&s;y Sen&s;ation; the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Suffer|ings of Humanity do not awake this natural Di&s;po&s;ition in them as they did before.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;uppo&s;e you tell a compa&s;&s;ionate Man, that is a Surgeon, of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
<PB N="27" REF="35">
a poor Creature who is &s;tarving in Pri&s;on; this will affect him fifty Times more than your telling him of a Man that is expiring with both his Thighs broke: While the Keeper of a Pri&s;on, perhaps, would be le&s;s affected to &s;ee the Condition of a Man ex|piring beneath all the complicated Mi&s;eries of Want and Confinement, than at the Sight of a fractured Skull or a broken Arm.</P>
<P>But the Rea&s;on why we find, among tho&s;e People who are daily familiar to Scenes of Mi&s;ery, &s;o little Appearances of this In|&s;tinct to Goodne&s;s, is perhaps from their be|ing <HI>naturally more void of it</HI> than others, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed one great Rea&s;on, why they &s;hould chu&s;e or endure to be of &s;uch Profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner, many People run into Vice, by becoming familiar to Actions which at fir&s;t a &s;eeming Nece&s;&s;ity for im|po&s;es upon the Rea&s;on to conclude in &s;ome Mea&s;ure ju&s;tifiable. As a Man, that is &s;tarv|ing, might po&s;&s;ibly prevail on his Rea&s;on to conclude, that his Condition alleviates the Crime of his robbing on the Highway, and he may &s;ilence his natural Di&s;po&s;ition to Pity or Goodne&s;s of Heart, from the &s;pecious Suppo&s;ition that the Loo&s;ers may not be in a Condition to want, and therefore Mi&s;ery may not be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Ac|tion; and thus he goes on, from one Step
<PB N="28" REF="36">
to another, till this natural In&s;tinct is not apprehen&s;ive when to exert it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was from a Knowledge of the Truth of this, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>Vice is a Mon&s;ter of &s;o frightful Mein,</L>
<L>That to be hated needs but to be &s;een,</L>
<L>But &s;een too oft, familiar with her Face,</L>
<L>We fir&s;t endure, then pity, then embrace.</L></Q>
Thus it is, that a Man, who naturally has a great Share of this Goodne&s;s of Heart, may be brought, from one Action to another, to commit the mo&s;t horrid of all Vices, Mur|der. But how often do we &s;ee that, how|ever powerful have been the Motives that have induced them to &s;uch an Action, yet this In&s;tinct, awaking in them, has &s;o &s;trong|ly re&s;i&s;ted and made &s;uch a terrible Conflict in the Soul, that &s;ome have &s;tood, without being able to exert an Act of Volition, to move their Hands to commit the Fact.&mdash; Others have begun, and have been unable to perform the Murder effectually: And very few but that the Moment the Fact has been perpetrated, have had no manner of Thought of the Motives that led them to it, but have been &s;truck with inexpre&s;&s;ible Horror, which has been the Effect of that Goodne&s;s of Heart implanted in the Soul.</P>
<P>And it is plain, that the De&s;ire of gratify|ing our Appetites and Inclinations, which impo&s;es it&s;elf on the Rea&s;on as a rational Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
<PB N="29" REF="37">
is the Cau&s;e why the Powers of judg|ing of moral Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s draw fal&s;e Conclu&s;ions; from which the Will influences the Body to commit Acts of Vice: For a Man that has naturally a greater Share of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Pride</HI> than a <HI>Love of Gain,</HI> will &s;ooner kill or offend another out of <HI>Re&s;ent|ment,</HI> than out of a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI>; while the Man who&s;e Soul is more &s;trongly influenced by <HI>Avarice,</HI> an Inclination natu|rally implanted in the Soul, than by any <HI>other Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> will &s;ooner kill or offend a Man, out of a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Gain</HI> than out of <HI>Re&s;entment.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is evident, that the Pa&s;&s;ions, to which the Soul acting in Conjunction with the Body is &s;ubject, do, by impo&s;ing on the Rea&s;on, make it direct the Will to influence us to Actions of Vice: For, as has been before ob&s;erved, the Will is a Power directed by the Rea&s;on, as it appears in the mo&s;t abandoned Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>For when do we &s;ee a Man attempt to &s;tab, or cut the Throat of another, with a <HI>Straw?</HI> Never&mdash;unle&s;s he be a Madman or an Idiot; and then we think there is no Ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing him for his Actions.&mdash; It is plain then, by the rational Means taken to perpetrate Scenes of Villany, that Rea&s;on is in Action at that Time. Whence is it then that any Vice is acted, unle&s;s the Power of judging of moral Fitne&s;s or Unfitne&s;s is not vitiated and abus'd? and this Power, it is
<PB N="30" REF="38">
plain, is more or le&s;s influenced according to that Goodne&s;s of Heart found in &s;ome De|gree, perhaps, in every Man.</P>
<P>But if there be a Man, who, without He|&s;itation, from no Cau&s;e either of Re&s;entment or Intere&s;t, can go and &s;tab another and feel no Remor&s;e at what he has done; that Man is either a Madman or an Idiot, entirely in|capable of Rea&s;on at all, or el&s;e he is a Man that has not, nor ever had, any Goodne&s;s of Heart in his Nature.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that tho' natural In&s;tinct or Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s is the Source of moral Virtue, yet it is directed to virtuous Actions by the Rea&s;on; and that it may be influenced to remain &s;eemingly inactive by tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions which Rea&s;on naturally draws from &s;pecious and deluding Propo&s;i|tions, offer'd to it by the Will or the De&s;ire of gratifying our Inclinations: So that either the Want of this natural In&s;tinct, or the vi|tiated Power of Rea&s;on, which Men have in Proportion to their Knowledge, may occa&s;ion Men to fall into Vice. And it is plain, that a Man that has a greater Share of this In&s;tinct join'd to his Rea&s;on, or a greater Share of Rea&s;on join'd to this In&s;tinct, will &s;upport the &s;ame Misfortunes much longer, without endeavouring to relieve him&s;elf by Actions of Vice, than that Man who has le&s;s of both.</P>
<P>And it is plain, that Men, who de&s;ervedly bear the Character of the &s;tricte&s;t Virtue,
<PB N="31" REF="39">
might, in the &s;ame Situation, have been no more able, either by <HI>Goodne&s;s of Heart or Rea&s;on,</HI> to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of <HI>gratifying their Pa&s;&s;ions</HI>; than tho&s;e that have been remark|able for the mo&s;t glaring Actions of Vice.&mdash; For there is no Man can be certain what he &s;hould or &s;hould not have done, if under Circum&s;tances which he never experienced.</P>
<P>And now it is plain al&s;o, that Men cannot give or take away from the Soul the Powers of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>In&s;tinct:</HI> and it is as entirely owing to the Cau&s;e of the univer&s;al Power or the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> that one Man is <HI>inbe|nevolent,</HI> as that another is <HI>dull.</HI></P>
<P>And as I hold it entirely commendable, that the Law &s;hould puni&s;h or execute a Man who &s;hews he either wants <HI>Ju&s;tne&s;s of Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Goodne&s;s of Heart</HI> to direct his Actions; &s;o I hold it as ju&s;t, that an <HI>Idiot</HI> or a <HI>Madman</HI> &s;hould equally be puni&s;hed or executed, as they are found to want the&s;e al&s;o.&mdash;So that while there remains the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to hope a Madman may recover his Rea&s;on, to influ|ence his Goodne&s;s of Heart, whereby he may be of Service to Community, I would have him only confin'd to Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore him. So I would, for the Safety of Mankind, have all Men, who are found to want <HI>either of the&s;e,</HI> whether from the greater Want of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as in <HI>Idiots,</HI> or the greater Want of <HI>Goodne&s;s of Heart,</HI> as in <HI>Villains,</HI> of which &s;ome are greater Fools and others
<PB N="32" REF="40">
greater Knaves, only confined to Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore them, if po&s;&s;ible to be of Service to Mankind: But, if they are found to be, from more flagrant and repeated Ac|tions of Vice, incapable of &s;uch a Re&s;taura|tion; I would have them <HI>legally</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>legally,</HI> for there is no Man that can be &s;up|po&s;ed to do Ju&s;tice for him&s;elf; &s;ince tho&s;e Injuries that appear to a Man, when committed again&s;t his own Per|&s;on, appear wonderfully heinous to the &s;ame Injuries committed again&s;t others.&mdash;It behoves therefore, that all Vices &s;hould be in&s;pected and puni&s;hed by tho&s;e, who are entirely di&s;intere&s;ted. Hence it will follow, that no <HI>Villain</HI> ought to be a <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> as he is intere&s;ted in the Cau&s;e of Vice; and that no <HI>one Man</HI> &s;hould have that arbitrary Power, of doing either him&s;elf or others Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> put to Death, and commend it as a virtuous Action nece&s;&s;ary to the public Good, whether they be <HI>Madmen, Fools,</HI> or <HI>Villains.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' here appears Ju&s;tice in this Ac|tion; it is becau&s;e <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> are Ac|tions that affect only Mankind; but it would be &s;tupid to imagine the original Cau&s;e of all Things, or God would <HI>eternally puni&s;h</HI> the Souls of Men, for not acting otherwi&s;e than they were influenced to do, from Powers which he is the Cau&s;e of: and it is ju&s;t as &s;tupid, to think it Inju&s;tice in the Creator, to leave unrewarded a Man, for doing what the Frame, Make and Nature of his Soul obliges him to do.</P>
<P>There appears then no Nece&s;&s;ity for future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, from the ab|&s;tracted Notions of Virtue and Vice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> Certain Rea&s;ons for the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>future Re|wards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> examined.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THERE may appear, perhaps, a Nece&s;|&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, from the Sickne&s;s, Angui&s;h, and Per&s;ecution of the Virtuous in their Life Time; while many of the Wicked &s;eem to be entirely free from the&s;e Inconveniencies.</HI></P>
<P>As to this, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to trace how much Trouble or Mi&s;ery one &s;ingle vitious Action of our Lives may, by a thou|&s;and un&s;een and unaccountable Accidents, inflict on the World: So if Mi&s;ery is the Con&s;equence of Vice, as has been prov'd, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell what Man occa&s;ions mo&s;t Mi&s;ery; &s;ince one &s;ingle Act of Vice, com|mitted on &s;ome particular Occa&s;ions by one Man, may occa&s;ion a thou&s;and Times more Mi&s;ery in the World, than the &s;ame Act a thou&s;and Times repeated by another, and in other Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Now in the &s;tricte&s;t Notions of Ju&s;tice, no Man &s;hould bear more Mi&s;ery than he has been the Occa&s;ion of to others; but &s;hould bear his Share in proportion to that: For if a Man is only to bear &s;o much Mi&s;e|ry as he intends to inflict by a vitious Act, perhaps he did not intend to be the Occa|&s;ion
<PB N="34" REF="42">
of a thou&s;andth Part of that which may happen by that Act;&mdash;who then mu&s;t &s;uffer for occa&s;ioning that Mi&s;ery?&mdash;Perhaps you will &s;ay, that Man who intended &s;o much Unhappine&s;s by doing an Act, by which it may &s;o happen from the Nature of Things, none at all &s;hall be effected.</P>
<P>But I believe Experience &s;ufficiently con|vinces us, that very few, if any, of Mankind intend the Mi&s;ery which is the Con&s;equence of Vice: But that, if that Con&s;equence ap|pear'd to them in a ju&s;t Light, perhaps the wor&s;t of Men would tremble with Horror at the Thought of committing &s;uch an Act.&mdash; Yet tho' we &s;uppo&s;e that Men &s;hould, in &s;trict Ju&s;tice, be an&s;werable for all the Mi|&s;ery their Actions may be the Occa&s;ion of, each mu&s;t be an&s;werable as an Individual; for one Man cannot be &s;uppos'd to &s;upport the Mi&s;eries of a thou&s;and People put toge|ther, tho' one &s;ingle Act of his may offend &s;o many.&mdash;He mu&s;t therefore pay in Pro|portion to him&s;elf as a &s;ingle Being, what he owes to Mankind: And if &s;o, who knows how much of this Debt the Pains and Dif|ficulties, daily attendant on the human Body and Mind, do hourly di&s;charge? Or who can tell how much committed Mi&s;ery is a|ton'd for, by a terrifying Dream, or a raging Fit of the Gout or the Tooth-Ach? Add to this, the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Pain</HI> always in &s;ome
<PB N="35" REF="43">
degree concomitant to the Actions of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, then, why may we not infer that the &s;upreme Being doth actually di&s;pen&s;e Ju&s;tice to all the human Race, tho' by Means inexplicable to us, in this World; and that the Ballance of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery, is ad|ju&s;ted at the Death of every Man.</P>
<P>But you may call this ab&s;tru&s;e or perhaps idle Rea&s;oning. Yet we may, by looking round to the &s;en&s;ible Creatures about us, and by making &s;ome ju&s;t Compari&s;ons, ac|quire a better Idea of our&s;elves, and the In|&s;ufficiency of this Rea&s;on to expect a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>In what&s;oever Degree we are pleas'd to con&s;ider our&s;elves above the Brute Creation, no body will deny, but that the great Cre|ator acts with impartial Ju&s;tice towards every one, even the mo&s;t minute and in&s;ignificant of his Creatures. Why is it then a <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> or <HI>Cat,</HI> &s;hall be nouri&s;h'd and fed with all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, while others of their Species &s;hall be &s;ubject to continual hard Labour, to whipping, or being worried to Death.</P>
<P>Can we &s;uppo&s;e this or that Hor&s;e, Dog or Cat, has de&s;erv'd more or le&s;s from the Hands of its Creator than another? If not, certainly there mu&s;t be, according to our Notions of Ju&s;tice with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, a State in which the Sufferers &s;hall be re|compenced
<PB N="36" REF="44">
for the Pains and Fatigues of Life.</P>
<P>But this &s;eems to argue the Immortality of Brutes, <HI>which we &s;hall not now con&s;ider,</HI> or that, by Means utterly unknown to us, the Creator di&s;pen&s;es Ju&s;tice to the&s;e Creatures in their Life time; and if to them, why is it not probable that, by &s;ome &s;uch like Means, he may act with us.</P>
<P>This, however, &s;hews how imperfect are our Notions of what we call <HI>Divine Ju&s;tice</HI>; and how little from them is our Rea&s;on to expect a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, when we cannot tell, whether we have Ju&s;tice done us in this World or no.</P>
<P>Having now con&s;ider'd the Proofs of the Philo&s;ophers in favour of the Soul's Immor|tality, and the Rea&s;ons that might induce us to think &s;uch an Immortality nece&s;&s;ary; and as we find, in their pretended Proofs, no evident Demon&s;tration of any &s;uch Doctrine; and as from the &s;eeming Rea&s;ons of its Ne|ce&s;&s;ity we can draw no rational Conclu&s;ions to expect it, we will now proceed to exa|mine the Rea&s;ons that induce us to think the <HI>Soul cannot be immortal.</HI></P>
<P>To this End, we will con&s;ider our rela|tion to &s;en&s;ible Creatures, who&s;e Souls are e&s;teem'd by Philo&s;ophers at be&s;t, but Souls of another and an inferior Nature, and which they don't &s;cruple to pronounce have no Title to Immortality.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VII.</HI> Our Relation to the Brute Creation con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Inference of &s;imilar and equal Cau&s;es, from &s;imilar and equal Effects, that leads us to the mo&s;t ju&s;t and rational Knowledge; and which, as <HI>Watts</HI> ob&s;erves, con&s;titutes a great Part of the Science of Mankind.</P>
<P>Who doubts, nay, is it not commonly laid down as the mo&s;t evident of all <HI>Truths,</HI> that <HI>we &s;hall all die?</HI>&mdash;But whence do we draw this Truth?&mdash;Why, from Rea&s;on,&mdash;from this Manner of Compari&s;on: We daily &s;ee that Creatures of &s;imilar Form, Organs and Faculties to our&s;elves, are &s;ubject to Death; and meet with none who&s;e length of Years are &s;o far beyond the common Account of our Lives, as to give us the lea&s;t Room to think them exempt from it; becau&s;e we find their growing up, their Maturity and Decay, exactly re&s;emble tho&s;e that went before them.&mdash;We &s;ee al&s;o this &s;ame Decay and Death happen to every Animal in the Brute Creation; and tho' we &s;hould meet with a Creature of &s;o extraordinary a Kind as to have lived for two or three Centuries, and to have been tran&s;mitted from Father to Son, we &s;hould admire it as an Animal of exce&s;&s;ive long Life, but &s;hould not in the lea&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="46">
doubt but that it would die &s;ome Time or other; tho' we never &s;aw or heard of any &s;uch a one's dying in our Lives.</P>
<P>Now this Accident, as well as many others, Mankind have in common with the Brutes. &mdash;We cannot live without Su&s;tenance any more than they;&mdash;are as liable in our Na|ture to Hurts, Pains and Di&s;ea&s;es as they are: And if it &s;hould be prov'd we are po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of the &s;ame Kind of a Soul, however &s;uperior, (tho' it may perhaps be &s;hewn in &s;ome Ca&s;es to be e&s;&s;entially equal) is it not as indi&s;putable a Truth that our Souls mu&s;t cea&s;e to exi&s;t like theirs, or if we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves immortal, that their Immortality mu&s;t be &s;imilar to ours.</P>
<P>I hope no one will, too ra&s;hly, think this Manner of rea&s;oning a Di&s;paragement to the Dignity of human Nature, before he has well con&s;ider'd the Dignity and Wi&s;dom of an <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Fox,</HI> and an <HI>Elephant.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then now examine how nearly we are allied to the Animal Creation;&mdash;and fir&s;t, as to the Body.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers agree, that all <HI>Matter</HI> is e&s;|&s;entially the &s;ame, and differs only in its Mo|dification; but that the different Modifica|tion of Matter, gives it no &s;uperior or infe|rior Degree of Merit, in it&s;elf con&s;ider'd.&mdash; For whether the Clay be converted into the mo&s;t pompous and &s;uperb Figure, with re|&s;pect to us, it is exactly the &s;ame Clay, con|&s;ider'd
<PB N="39" REF="47">
in it&s;elf, as that which is converted to the meane&s;t and vile&s;t U&s;es.</P>
<P>But &s;hould we bring the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons, from Experience or Philo&s;ophy, to prove the Bodies either of Men or Brutes &s;uperior, we mu&s;t give the Cau&s;e entirely again&s;t our&s;elves. Experience tells us, that the human Body, dive&s;ted of the Soul, is to us more nau&s;eous and dete&s;table, than that of mo&s;t Brutes: And if, from Philo&s;ophy, we &s;hould agree that Bea&s;ts have no Thought or Liberty at all, but are only Pieces of finely organiz'd Matter, capable of many &s;ubtile Motions communicated to them by outward Objects, we, by this, yield them the Superi|ority; &s;ince we own the Matter of our Bo|dies is not capable of &s;uch Sen&s;ation, but that our Sen&s;ation is the Faculty of the Soul. We find al&s;o, that by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Revolution of Particles of Matter, that &s;ame Matter which is at one Time Gra&s;s, becomes part of a Bea&s;t, and from thence to be part of a Man, by Means of the Su&s;tenance of Life.</P>
<P>Neither doth the Form of Man give him any Pre-eminence in the Order of Beings, as it is no more &s;erviceable to him in the Offices of his Life, than are the Forms of the Brutes to them; and tho' we di&s;tingui&s;h a Man from a Brute rather by his outward Form than by the Dignity of his Soul, of which we cannot &s;o immediately judge, yet it is po&s;&s;ible there are, nay, there have been, many
<PB N="40" REF="48">
In&s;tances of Creatures more re&s;embling in their Form the <HI>Human</HI> than the <HI>Brute</HI> Spe|cies; &s;uch as the <HI>Chimpanzee,</HI> and which for want of under&s;tanding Speech and Talk|ing, have yet been e&s;teem'd Brutes.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, I never heard any body pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that a <HI>wild Boy,</HI> I re|member to have &s;een, was not of the <HI>Human</HI> Species, tho' he could not &s;peak, nor under|&s;tand Speech any otherwi&s;e than a Dog might do, and was be&s;ide all over hairy like a Dog or a Monkey; tho' his Features were almo&s;t as regular as I ever &s;aw tho&s;e of a Man.</P>
<P>It is plain then, from &s;uch In&s;tances as the&s;e, that it is po&s;&s;ible, by an intermixing of Species, that there are Creatures in the World who&s;e Form and Intellects are &s;o join'd, that no body can pretend to deter|mine ju&s;tly whether they are Men or Brutes.</P>
<P>Now if this be, as certainly it is, the Ca&s;e, there is no other true Di&s;tinction in the Or|der of Beings, than by that Power which is their Life;&mdash; that which directs them to &s;eek Happine&s;s or &s;hun Mi&s;ery, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Soul.</P>
<P>We will now then con&s;ider what is the Soul of a Brute, and how far it re&s;embles the Soul of Man.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> The Souls of Brutes, what Philo&s;ophers agree they are.</HEAD>
<P>IF Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Suppo&s;ition be true, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Spirit be only a Property of Matter, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity cea&s;e to be when that Matter has evidently no particular Property at all.

<P>Take the mo&s;t ignorant and &s;tupid of all the human Species, and compare his intel|lectual Faculty or Soul to that of a <HI>Locke,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> or a <HI>Boyle,</HI>&mdash;what a wonderful Dif|ference! how weak, how in&s;ignificant, how mean are the Ideas on one Side! how &s;trong,
<PB N="42" REF="50">
how copious, and how elevated on the other! and yet we don't &s;cruple in the lea&s;t to al|low the <HI>one</HI> a Soul as <HI>immortal</HI> as the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Is it becau&s;e they re&s;emble each other in their outward Form that we do this; if &s;o, how exce&s;&s;ively, how poorly, ridiculous do we judge of the Order of Beings!</P>
<P>Now &s;ince from &s;uch an Inferiority in the Faculties of the Soul, we draw no Inference of the want of Immortality, we &s;hall cer|tainly find, by comparing the actuating Power of &s;ome Brutes with that of &s;ome Men, that there being not &s;o much Difference between Brutes and Men as there is between Men and Men, that we have no Ground to &s;uppo&s;e one more immortal than the other.</P>
<P>But to confirm the Ju&s;tice of &s;uch a Man|ner of rea&s;oning, we will quote a Pa&s;&s;age from the learned Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> wherein he advances more than could, from him, be ex|pected in favour of the Brute Creation.</P>
<P>This Writer, after &s;uppo&s;ing that human Nature can hardly receive or bear the No|tion of Bea&s;ts having no Sen&s;ation or Thought at all about them, becau&s;e there are &s;uch evident Indications of even high Degrees of Rea&s;on among the Bea&s;ts, he therefore con|cludes,
<Q>That it is more rea&s;onable to ima|gine there may be Spirits, of a <HI>lower Or|der,</HI> in Brutes, that have in them a Ca|pacity of thinking and chu&s;ing, but that 'tis &s;o entirely under the Impre&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="43" REF="51">
Matter, that they are not capable of that Largene&s;s either of Thought or Liberty, that is nece&s;&s;ary to make them capable of Good or Evil, of Rewards or Puni&s;hments; but that, <HI>therefore,</HI> they may be perpetu|ally rolling about from one Body to ano|ther;</Q>
<HI>that is,</HI> by Tran&s;migration.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> having quoted this Pa&s;&s;age, &s;tates the Ca&s;e on both Sides the Que&s;tion; and for want of one &s;ingle Argument to pro|ceed further (without injuring that Sy&s;tem, to the Promotion of which, however ab|&s;urdly, he wanted to reduce all his philo&s;o|phical Arguments) very fairly gives it up, and &s;ays he can make nothing at all of it. And yet, after this Confe&s;&s;ion, he goes on to tell you, no Conclu&s;ions can be drawn from the Nature of Bea&s;ts, let the Ca&s;e be decided how it will, that can affect the Na|ture, Rea&s;on, or Religion of Mankind.</P>
<P>This, however, you are to take upon the Credit of his Word only, and are to believe the Immortality of the Soul, from the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which, he &s;ays, <HI>it is the Glory and Intere&s;t of the &s;upreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e to ap|point.</HI> For tho' he &s;o frankly owns, he knows &s;o little of the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Dignity</HI> of a <HI>Brute,</HI> yet he does not at all &s;cruple to de|cide what is the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t of a</HI> GOD, who&s;e e&s;&s;ential Perfections, it is impo&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="44" REF="52">
after all our Searches, to know any thing at all about.</P>
<P>As to the Bi&s;hop's Conclu&s;ion, that the Soul of a Brute mu&s;t be more &s;ubject to Mat|ter than that of a Man, it is merely a Con|jecture, the Force of which will appear when we come to con&s;ider the Actions of Brutes in Compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Men.</P>
<P>Yet to infer, that (&s;uppo&s;ing it prov'd) <HI>becau&s;e they are incapable of Rewards and Puni&s;hments,</HI> they mu&s;t be tran&s;migrated from one Body to another, is exce&s;&s;ively &s;tupid; for the Di&s;tribution of Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, &s;eems more applicable to this Sy&s;tem than any other.</P>
<P>As that Soul that &s;uffer'd exce&s;&s;ive Toil and Drudgery in one Bea&s;t, and was in it&s;elf of a harmle&s;s Nature, might, by Tran&s;mi|gration, be converted into another Body, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e Life might be nothing but Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure; &s;o, on the contrary, the Soul that in one Life and Form had ta&s;ted all the Sweets and Enjoyments in its Kind, and was an offen&s;ive Animal, might have a &s;uitable Retaliation in &s;ome other Body.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers who mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t on the Immortality of the Soul of Man, are nece&s;&s;itated to conclude, that Brutes have Souls capable of Sen&s;ation and Reflection: And we find, that upon granting this, when they endeavour to di|&s;tingui&s;h it from the Soul of Man in &s;o im|portant
<PB N="45" REF="53">
a Point as its <HI>Immortality,</HI> what egre|gious Blunders they fall into.</P>
<P>This <HI>Watts</HI> &s;aw; and rather than make any Blunder that might prejudice his Cau&s;e from a Conclu&s;ion in this Point, very judi|ciou&s;ly, doth not decide any thing at all about it; tho' in avoiding this, he unluckily falls into that Mi&s;take I have above expos'd.</P>
<P>We will now come to compare the De|grees of Under&s;tanding in Men and Brutes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> The Powers of Under&s;tanding in Men and Brutes compared.</HEAD>
<P>WE have con&s;ider'd the Soul of Man as e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ting in the Fa|culties of <HI>Sen&s;ation, Reflection,</HI> and, what is directed by the&s;e, the <HI>Will.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, as to <HI>Perception</HI> or <HI>Sen&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>We have a thou&s;and In&s;tances wherein the nice Di&s;tinctions of Sen&s;ation are more rea|dily communicated to the Soul of the Brute than the Man.</P>
<P>Of this there needs no other Example than that wonderful Power in the Dog, whereby he &s;hall trace, by the &s;ubtle Efflu|vias of Smell, not only an Animal, but a human Creature:&mdash;We daily &s;ee this, and are &s;urpriz'd at that extraordinary In&s;tinct which
<PB N="46" REF="54">
we find our&s;elves &s;o void of; that a Man, with all the Faculties of his Soul engaged, &s;hall not be able to tell which Path, among twenty, his Friend hath taken; while we &s;ee his Dog, without any other Advan|tage from external Objects, in them&s;elves con|&s;ider'd, &s;hall pur&s;ue the right Track after him.</P>
<P>Thus, in every Article of Sen&s;ation, there remains not the lea&s;t Doubt but that, among &s;ome or other of the Brute Creation, they are found to have <HI>Perception equal,</HI> and, in many Ca&s;es, <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>Now then, we mu&s;t con&s;ider in what De|gree they have <HI>Reflection</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>; and un|der this Head, we will ju&s;t &s;peak of the <HI>Will.</HI> It is plain that the Power of Volition is, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, influenc'd by <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI>;&mdash;as, when the Sen&s;es are acting, we cannot chu&s;e but &s;ee, hear, feel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now in other Ca&s;es, it is plainly influenc'd by the Powers of Sen|&s;ation, acting with tho&s;e of Rea&s;on:&mdash;As &s;uppo&s;ing a Man &s;hould &s;ee a prodigious <HI>Weight</HI> falling towards his Head, the Ap|prehen&s;ion occa&s;ion'd by the Sen&s;ation at that Time, which makes the Will direct the Body to get out of Danger, is partly the Effect of <HI>Rea&s;on:</HI> For if a Man was to &s;ee a Feather falling down, he would perhaps entirely di&s;regard it, tho' he may be as &s;en&s;ible of the De&s;cent of the <HI>Feather</HI> as of the <HI>Weight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">And this Power of <HI>Volition,</HI> Brutes have in common with Men; for by this, their Bodies move and act, equally wi&s;e for their own U&s;e and Safety as we do.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Reflection</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is a Faculty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Soul's <HI>e&s;&s;ential Exi&s;tence,</HI> that, without it, we &s;hould not be capable of acting for our Pre&s;ervation.&mdash;This we find al&s;o in a great Degree e&s;&s;ential to the Souls of Brutes; for it is plain that Animals remember Per&s;ons and Things, Acts of Kindne&s;s and Di&s;kind|ne&s;s, of which we have daily ten thou&s;and In&s;tances.</P>
<P>Some Animals &s;tand in Dread of what has offended them; others again remember to re|&s;ent the Offence receiv'd.&mdash;A Hor&s;e &s;tands in fear of a Whip and the Smack of it, becau&s;e he remembers the Smart he felt at the Time he &s;aw the &s;ame Object, or heard the &s;ame Sound.&mdash;A <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> naturally &s;tarts at the Sound of a Drum, becau&s;e it occa&s;ions a Sen|&s;ation he is a Stranger to, and therefore he doth not know the Con&s;equence of it; but after hearing it &s;everal Times repeated, and feeling no Hurt ari&s;e from it, he takes no more Notice of that than of any other fami|liar Sound.</P>
<P>So a <HI>Man</HI> is <HI>equally</HI> &s;tartled at an <HI>unu&s;ual Noi&s;e,</HI> but when he finds no hurtful Con&s;e|quence ari&s;e from it, the Repetition of the &s;ame Accident will le&s;s and le&s;s affect him,
<PB N="48" REF="56">
till it comes at la&s;t to have no other Effect than that of confirming him when there is &s;uch a Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>A Man is al&s;o afraid of a Thru&s;t from a Sword, becau&s;e either he has felt the Smart it can occa&s;ion, or from Information or Re|flection on the Effects of a &s;imilar Cau&s;e, he ju&s;tly imagines it can hurt him: So if you could inform a Hor&s;e that had never felt the Whip, that it would hurt like &s;omething he had felt, he would &s;tand in the &s;ame Fear.</P>
<P>Neither doth the Difficulty of informing the Hor&s;e this, argue any thing of his want of Reflection or Rea&s;on: For if you were to &s;hew a Man, who&s;e Language you were a Stranger to, an In&s;trument, the Effects of which he had never &s;een, or the Effects of any thing &s;imilar to it, you would find per|haps as much Difficulty in communicating the Knowledge of its Effects to him by In|formation, as the Effect of a Whip to a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;ing the Hor&s;e entirely ignorant of the Whip, the Sound attending it, and the Action accompanying the Blow, yet if you take another Hor&s;e and la&s;h him with it, the Animal that &s;tands by will be immediately apprehen&s;ive of &s;omething from it; but not becau&s;e he hears the Sound, or &s;ees the Blow, but by the Agitation and Concern in which he &s;ees and hears his fellow Creature at that Time, and of this he is naturally a Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="57">Now to this <HI>Apprehen&s;ion</HI> are join'd the Circum&s;tances of the Blow, the Whip, and the Sound, which are in&s;eparable Ideas; and therefore when he hears or &s;ees the one, he is immediately apprehen&s;ive of the other. So, in the former Ca&s;e, you mu&s;t &s;hew the Man its Effects upon &s;omething who&s;e Na|ture and Properties he is acquainted with, and then he can be ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of the true Effect of &s;uch an In&s;trument.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, that the Soul of a Brute has, be&s;ides all the Properties of Sen|&s;ation, the Powers of Volition, and that of retaining &s;imple Ideas equal to Man, and of acting as rationally from tho&s;e Ideas.&mdash;But we will con&s;ider this further.</P>
<P>The Rule Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> lays down is evident.
<Q>We cannot rea&s;on but from what we know.</Q>
A Man cannot form any Ideas of Things who&s;e Nature he is entirely ignorant of, and of any thing &s;imilar thereto, (for the mo&s;t ab&s;tracted and metaphy&s;ical Idea, mu&s;t have its Foundation from the Knowledge of phy|&s;ical and natural Cau&s;es.)</P>
<P>A Man who never had the Sen&s;e of <HI>hear|ing,</HI> cannot rea&s;on of <HI>Sound,</HI> or of any thing &s;imilar to it; if of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> he can form no Idea relative to <HI>Form</HI> or <HI>Colours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> then is the Power of drawing In|ferences from Ideas acquir'd by Sen&s;ation, which Inferences are Ideas form'd purely by
<PB N="50" REF="58">
the Soul's Reflection, or Power of compar|ing Effects and Properties within it&s;elf, tho' the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Effects, and the Things po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e Properties, may perhaps be ten thou&s;and Miles withdrawn from any of the Organs of Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>In what Degree then are &s;ome Men po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of this Power of Rea&s;on?&mdash;We find here, that while we have had Men who&s;e profound Capacities have been able to com|prehend and retain almo&s;t every Kind of Knowledge, we have had others who have been capable of entering but into one or two Branches of Science; and others again en|tirely incapacitated to comprehend or retain any thing at all of Science. Thus we &s;ee &s;ome Men &s;o deeply enter into mathemati|cal Learning and the Science of Algebra, while others can't imagine in the lea&s;t what they are about, who talk of <HI>&s;ome Quantities</HI> le&s;s <HI>than</HI> nothing, <HI>and of others not quite</HI> &s;o much le&s;s <HI>than</HI> nothing.</P>
<P>And yet tho&s;e who can't comprehend this, perhaps may very well under&s;tand that <HI>two and two make four,</HI> and that <HI>three times three make nine</HI>; becau&s;e the&s;e are Ideas, the Truth of which may, by the Organs of Sen|&s;ation, be demon&s;trated: And whenever the Mind doth judge, it can judge no otherwi&s;e; and yet there are &s;ome Men &s;o dull and void of the Power of thinking, that they cannot comprehend <HI>by what Means</HI> or <HI>how</HI> this
<PB N="51" REF="59">
Axiom is true, without &s;uch a &s;en&s;ative De|mon&s;tration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to a&s;&s;ert that a Bea&s;t, of any Kind, is capable of this Knowledge; otherwi&s;e than that a Hor&s;e mu&s;t feel that the Weight or Power of one is le&s;s than that of two, of two le&s;s than three, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;This appears by his Act of Volition, in putting out an additional Strength to re&s;i&s;t in pro|portion to &s;uch an added Force.&mdash;Neither is it any ways material to the Purpo&s;es of that Bea&s;t, or doth it argue again&s;t the e&s;&s;ential Power of Rea&s;on in the Brute, that this Truth does not come to him in the Form of a Propo|&s;ition, &s;ince he is as &s;en&s;ible of the Ju&s;tice of the Axiom, as a Man who is convinc'd by his Sen&s;es, that the &s;ame Thing or Accident is &s;o many Times repeated, and cannot judge of it without the Evidence of his Sen&s;es, or the Remembrance of that Evidence.</P>
<P>Now, tho' &s;uch an Evidence is the Te&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;ublime Rea&s;oning, yet the Man of Science, taking &s;uch certain Axioms for granted, goes on, thro' a thou&s;and complex, &s;imilar, and di&s;&s;imilar Ideas, without ever having occa&s;ion to examine the &s;en&s;ative Truth of any one of tho&s;e Ideas.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch a Manner of Rea&s;oning, I will not pretend the Brutes to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of;&mdash; and yet at the &s;ame Time Experience tells us, that &s;uch a Manner of Rea&s;oning is as little inherent to &s;ome of the human Species.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="60">Either then we mu&s;t deny the Souls of the&s;e Men to be of the &s;ame Nature with tho&s;e of a &s;uperior Capacity of receiving Knowledge, or by admitting that the Souls of Brutes are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with Men of an inferior Capacity, we mu&s;t allow that they are of the &s;ame Nature with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t elevated Genius.</P>
<P>But perhaps it is not &s;ufficiently evident that the Souls of Men of narrow and weak Under&s;tandings, are as incapable of Rea&s;on as the <HI>Brutes,</HI> we will then compare their Intellects more particularly.</P>
<P>There can be no In&s;tance of the want of Rea&s;on in Man or Brute, but what mu&s;t ef|fect them either in <HI>Speculation</HI> or <HI>Practice.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then as to <HI>Practice,</HI> we can have no Cau&s;e to imagine the Brute wants Rea&s;on as to its Actions, if it provides as wi&s;ely for it&s;elf in its own Nature, as Man doth for him&s;elf in his; neither is the Effect of rational Propo|&s;itions of any Moment in this Ca&s;e: For we don't &s;ay that Man wants Rea&s;on, who avoids or chu&s;es any thing that is agreeable or de|trimental to his Nature, from his Knowledge of its Properties immediately by Sen&s;ation, any more than another who avoids or chu&s;es the &s;ame Thing, becau&s;e, from a long Train of Examinations into the Nature of Beings, their Effects, Modes and Properties, he is &s;en&s;ible <HI>why</HI> &s;uch a Thing is agreeable or de|trimental to his Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="61">The Philo&s;opher will not run his Head again&s;t a Wall, becau&s;e he is &s;en&s;ible of <HI>the Motion and Properties of Matter,</HI> and the Con&s;truction of his own Organs, Fibres, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which Knowledge he is &s;en&s;ible he &s;hall feel Pain by &s;uch an Action.</P>

Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> here puts the Lamb in the Place of a Man, which is not the Ca&s;e; we are to &s;uppo&s;e the Lamb endow'd with a human Soul:&mdash;Yet, as a Lamb, it is yean'd, brought up in the Fields and Pa&s;tures, knows nothing at all, or very little, of the Actions of Man; does not know a <HI>Butcher's Knife</HI> from a <HI>Piece of Wax in that Form</HI>; it &s;ees its Shep|herd, indeed, drive it or gently lead it from one Place to another, provide Fodder or a Fold for it at Night; this is all it knows of Mankind.&mdash;What Ground has it then to be apprehen&s;ive of Danger, whether it is in|clos'd in a Butcher's or a Shepherd's Pen? Since, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have a human Soul, it <HI>cannot rea&s;on but from what it knows:</HI> And it is very certain the Lamb, with its own Soul, is under terrible Apprehen&s;ions when it hears the Complaint of its Fellow Crea|tures, with whom it never fails to &s;ympa|thize, or when he is tied by the Heels for the Slaughter; this appears evident from its &s;truggling to get free, and if it was once loo&s;e,
<PB N="56" REF="64">
it would make its E&s;cape with all po&s;&s;ible Speed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> then &s;hould have &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>Had he thy</HI> KNOWLEDGE, <HI>would he &s;kip and play?</HI> For the Want of more exten&s;ive Knowledge, in any Creature wanting the Opportunity of acquiring more Knowledge, does not in the lea&s;t argue its Want of the Power of Rea&s;on|ing from the Knowledge it has. And it is al&s;o plain to me, that if a Lamb knew as much of a <HI>Butcher</HI> as it does of a <HI>Dog,</HI> it would &s;tand in fear of one as much as it does of the other; and would no &s;ooner permit it&s;elf to be drove into a <HI>Butcher's Shop,</HI> than it would into a <HI>River,</HI> where it might be <HI>drown'd,</HI> or into a <HI>Ditch</HI> where it might be <HI>&s;mothered.</HI></P>
<P>It is plain then, that a Lamb, tho' perhaps as &s;tupid a Creature as mo&s;t of the Brute Species, acts <HI>rationally</HI> from what it <HI>knows,</HI> and as wi&s;ely, to an&s;wer the Ends of its Crea|tion, as a Man.</P>
<P>You may perhaps &s;ay, it is <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> in the <HI>one,</HI> and the Effects of a <HI>rational Mind</HI> in the <HI>other:</HI>&mdash;but I will not quarrel with you about <HI>Words</HI>;&mdash;you may call it <HI>In&s;tinct, Soul, Mind,</HI> or what you plea&s;e;&mdash;but you mu&s;t fir&s;t prove an e&s;&s;ential Difference in two Beings, before I will allow them to be of a different Kind.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was very unwilling to go &s;o far as to think the Soul of the Brute of the
<PB N="57" REF="65">
&s;ame Nature with that of Man, and there|fore after &s;peaking of the wonderful In&s;tinct of Brutes, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>'Twixt that and Rea&s;on what a nice Barrier?</L>
<L>For ever &s;eparate, yet for ever near:</L>
<L>Remembrance and Reflection how allied,</L>
<L>What thin Partitions Sen&s;e from Thought divide?</L></Q></P>
<P>This Hair-breadth Difference, this Cob|web Partition doth not at all exi&s;t, but in the Vanity of Imagination; neither doth our Author give us any other Proof of its <HI>Being</HI> than a bare A&s;&s;ertion that it <HI>is:</HI> But Rea&s;on feels no &s;uch Thing:&mdash;<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> cannot help telling us, that when two Things are exactly alike, they mu&s;t be of the &s;ame Nature:&mdash; Would it not be &s;tupid to &s;ay, that any thing exactly round, may not be or that it is not a Circle; when all the Idea we have of a Circle is, that it is exactly round?&mdash;I believe you will &s;ay, yes:&mdash;certainly then, if the Soul of a Brute is po&s;&s;e&s;t of the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential Fa|culties as the Soul of a Man, it mu&s;t, po&s;i|tively mu&s;t, be e&s;teem'd of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>But let us examine into the Powers of Rea&s;on in the Brute Creation, relating to Speculation.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Points of Speculation &s;o immediately applicable to Practice, that per|haps they &s;hould have been before con&s;ider'd. The&s;e are tho&s;e which are the Foundations
<PB N="58" REF="66">
of <HI>Art,</HI> &s;uch are the Theories of <HI>Arithmetic, Geometry</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>; from which ari&s;e the <HI>Arts</HI> of <HI>Architecture, Commerce</HI> and <HI>Law.</HI> &mdash;Let us turn to the Brutes, and &s;ee the <HI>Effects</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Sciences</HI> among them.&mdash;The <HI>Spider's Web,</HI> the <HI>Bird's Ne&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Laws of the Bees,</HI> and the <HI>Oeconomy of the Pi&s;mire,</HI> are wonderful In&s;tances:&mdash;Then why &s;hould not we infer the <HI>&s;ame Effect mu&s;t proceed from the &s;ame Cau&s;e</HI>?&mdash;Or will you &s;ay this &s;eems to be rather <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> than <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e the Bea&s;t, Bird, and In&s;ect vary little in the&s;e Acts from the re&s;t of the &s;ame Kind; whereas &s;ome Men build one Kind of Hou&s;es, &s;ome another; &s;ome have one Method of Commerce, &s;ome another; &s;ome one Kind of Laws, &s;ome another. Yet &s;hall not we as rationally account for this by &s;aying, that Man, having more Pride and Curio&s;ity, is more whim&s;ical and wavering in his Actions than the Brutes, who &s;tudy no more than is nece&s;&s;ary to the U&s;e of Nature; and there|fore they are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not, however, clearly evident, that all the Brutes are uniform in &s;uch Actions with tho&s;e of their Species, &s;ince if we were as &s;en&s;ible of their Mechani&s;m as of our own, I make no Doubt but we &s;hould di&s;cover many ingenious and con&s;iderable Variations.</NOTE> uniform in their Actions: For it is certain the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of a Hou&s;e is not its <HI>Form, Advantage</HI> is the De&s;ign of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> the De&s;ign of <HI>Laws,</HI> however their <HI>Form</HI> or <HI>Method</HI> may vary.&mdash;Is it then from the idle Vanity of Curio&s;ity that we
<PB N="59" REF="67">
adjudge the Actions of Men to proceed from <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>; and from the Want of <HI>that only,</HI> that we allow the Actions of Brutes to be directed by bare In&s;tinct. &mdash; I think this is &s;tupid enough, &s;ince we allow that <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> performs the Purpo&s;es of the Animal to the full as well, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es much better, than <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> performs ours.</P>
<P>But to come to pure Speculation.</P>
<P>Is the Brute capable of laying down Pro|po&s;itions, and of forming Conclu&s;ions from them, relating to Things perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary for them to know. Of this we may ever remain ignorant, unle&s;s the Brutes could in|vent a way to communicate to us their Ideas; but here we are as ignorant, with re&s;pect to our Fellow Creatures, as to the Brutes. For if I meet a Man, or keep him Company for twelve Months, and in all that Time he nei|ther &s;peaks, writes, or by any Means com|municates his Thoughts to me, I'm entirely ignorant whether he be a Man of Science, or the mo&s;t illiterate of his Species. How|ever, if we may gue&s;s from <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> as we do among Men, I think it quite ea&s;y to imagine, when a Dog, Cat, or any other Animal is buried in <HI>deep Contemplation,</HI> and when a <HI>Jack-Daw, Magpye</HI> or <HI>Ape</HI> is chat|tering, I e&s;teem them <HI>coxcombly Brutes,</HI> that cannot think:&mdash;And whenever I look at an <HI>Owl,</HI> I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting but that, from its little Concern &s;hewn to external Objects,
<PB N="60" REF="68">
it is <HI>logically</HI> weighing &s;ome very nice Point of <HI>Metaphy&s;ics.</HI></P>
<P>But here it is po&s;&s;ible I may be deceiv'd; &mdash;yet if I am, it is nothing more than we are daily in the Appearances of Men,&mdash;when we imagine a <HI>grave Look</HI> and a <HI>&s;olemn Beha|viour,</HI> denote <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> and that a Man that <HI>chatters</HI> is a Coxcomb, which is not always the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having now brought all the Rea&s;ons that at pre&s;ent occur, and which I think &s;ufficient to place Mankind in a true Light, with re|&s;pect to their Fellow Creatures, <HI>for &s;o now I will pre&s;ume to call the Brutes,</HI> we mu&s;t draw this Conclu&s;ion, that Men of Science are of the highe&s;t Order of Animals, and that next them, all Creatures, without Di&s;tinction, mu&s;t take their Places, not according to the Form of their Bodies, but according to the native Greatne&s;s of their Souls; by which Order it will doubtle&s;s be found, that &s;ome Part of Mankind will &s;tand not only equal to but below &s;ome of the Brute Creation.</P>
<P>Now then to apply the De&s;ign of our Ar|guments:&mdash;If we allow <HI>Immortality</HI> to the <HI>Soul</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> and every Soul of the <HI>like Kind,</HI> we mu&s;t allow it to the meane&s;t of all Animals; whereby a Mou&s;e, a Rat, a Lou&s;e and a Flea, will have immortal Souls, &mdash;<HI>an intolerable Conclu&s;ion!</HI> or el&s;e we mu&s;t allow <HI>Immortality</HI> to the <HI>higher Order only,</HI> and &s;o fix a certain Degree at which it mu&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="69">
&s;top; and if we fix <HI>that</HI> &s;o <HI>low</HI> as to take in <HI>all</HI> and every Soul of an <HI>equal Degree</HI> to the <HI>Souls</HI> of the meane&s;t of Mankind, it is plain we mu&s;t include <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Brutes</HI> in our Sy&s;tem;&mdash;or by admitting <HI>none</HI> of the <HI>Brutes,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;hut out <HI>&s;ome Part</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> with them.&mdash;We will therefore proceed now to con&s;ider the Po&s;&s;ibility as well as the Proba|bility of the Souls, both of Brutes and Men, being <HI>mortal</HI> or <HI>cea&s;ing to exi&s;t, as Beings in them&s;elves, after the Death of the Body.</HI></P>

<P>IT was at fir&s;t allow'd, that the Soul is not a material Being, but only a Spirit or Power acting upon Matter by Means entirely unknown; that it is al&s;o capable of <HI>acting on it&s;elf,</HI> as by <HI>Reflection</HI>; and that upon its cea&s;ing to <HI>act,</HI> it mu&s;t immediately cea&s;e <HI>to be.</HI></P>
<P>Now all Power mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, however its Manner of acting may vary; as we mu&s;t allow that that Power which cau&s;es the Planets to move in their Orbits, is exactly of the &s;ame Nature as that which induces a Stone thrown upwards, to fall down again towards its proper Centre:&mdash;
<PB N="62" REF="70">
Exactly the &s;ame that enables a <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> to <HI>draw,</HI> a Man to walk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As that may be a Piece of Steel, exactly of the &s;ame Nature, and capable of the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ions, that lies in a rude Form, and is acting in a very <HI>&s;imple Manner</HI>; as that which is mo&s;t &s;ur|prizingly and ingeniou&s;ly active in a Clock or Watch: So 'tis that Power, called the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> that moves the <HI>Planets,</HI> the &s;ame that acts upon a <HI>Stone,</HI> upon a <HI>Brute,</HI> and upon a <HI>Man:</HI> For tho' a Man be con|&s;ider'd ever &s;o much of a <HI>free Agent,</HI> and may chu&s;e and refu&s;e his Actions, yet he can't go beyond &s;uch certains Laws;&mdash;he can't walk in the Air, nor move a Limb contrary, nor without an Act of Volition in his Mind, any more than a Watch can cea&s;e to go, or can go wrong, when all its Parts are <HI>ju&s;tly con&s;tructed</HI> and <HI>put</HI> together. So that Power, whereby we move Bodies from one Place to another, is &s;till the &s;ame Power of Nature, notwith&s;tanding their Motion be <HI>upwards,</HI> directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>known Laws</HI> of <HI>Gravitation</HI>; becau&s;e the Motion of the Arm, whereby &s;uch Bodies are impell'd, is the Effect of the &s;ame Power in a greater Degree; and it is as natural for a Stone to <HI>ri&s;e</HI> in the Air, when thrown up, as it is for it to <HI>fall</HI> again of its <HI>own accord.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e a Man throwing a Ball up|wards, it is plain he occa&s;ions a Power to act upon the Ball; for when it is out of his
<PB N="63" REF="71">
Hand, he doth not a&s;&s;i&s;t its Motion any more, yet the Ball proceeds: The Power therefore acts upon it; but <HI>how,</HI> or by <HI>what Means,</HI> we can tell no <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> than by &s;aying, it is the <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Power of Nature.</HI> Now it is the &s;ame <HI>Law of Nature</HI> that acts upon that Matter, which <HI>particularly con|&s;tructed</HI> is call'd <HI>Man.</HI>&mdash;But to our Suppo|&s;ition. We &s;ee that the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> which acts without Di&s;tinction upon all Bodies (whether endow'd with a human Soul or not) le&s;&s;ens by degrees the Power acting on the Ball till it goes no further; the Power then cea&s;es to act, con&s;equently cea&s;es <HI>to be.</HI></P>
<P>And it is in vain to deny that this <HI>Power</HI> is a <HI>Soul,</HI> becau&s;e we can't imagine it to be a <HI>cogitative</HI> or <HI>thinking Power,</HI> which means no more than a Power which can <HI>act</HI> on <HI>it|&s;elf</HI> as well as on <HI>Matter.</HI> Neither can we imagine this Power to be <HI>communicated from,</HI> or to be <HI>a Part of</HI> the <HI>human Soul</HI>; becau&s;e the &s;ame Power may be occa&s;ion'd by Things call'd <HI>in&s;en&s;ible.</HI> Thus it is po&s;&s;ible for even Man him&s;elf to be in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that by the Force occa&s;ion'd by inanimate Things, he may be thrown up an exce&s;&s;ive Height into the Air by <HI>Earthquake, Gun-powder,</HI> and the like. Now this <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Soul</HI> that forces him up, is &s;uperior in Strength to the Force of all the Faculties of his Soul acting together: For neither his exerting the
<PB N="64" REF="72">
&s;tronge&s;t Act of <HI>Volition</HI> or of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly prevent his &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Effect,</HI> if he re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It is plain al&s;o, that however nearly Mat|ter may be in&s;trumental in &s;uch an Accident, yet as the Soul doth not <HI>exi&s;t</HI> till it <HI>acts,</HI> and is nothing but <HI>Action,</HI> &s;o there is no Soul acting on the <HI>Gunpowder</HI> or <HI>Sulphur,</HI> till there be &s;uch a particular uniting of Particles of Matter; at which Juncture the Soul imme|diately <HI>exi&s;ts, acts,</HI> and no &s;ooner <HI>cea&s;es to act</HI> that in <HI>cea&s;es to be.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> doth not <HI>act, i. e.</HI> exi&s;t, till there be form'd &s;uch a particular Union of Matter, fram'd into Organs of Sen&s;e, Fi|bres, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fit for the Soul to act on; ju&s;t then the Soul begins to <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> and exi&s;ts acting, till by &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I would have none here conclude by the Word <HI>Ac|cident,</HI> that I think there is any &s;uch Thing as <HI>Chance,</HI> or that any Thing <HI>may</HI> or <HI>may not</HI> be; &s;ince however dark and intricate it may &s;eem to us, there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, in the Order of Nature, for Things to happen as they do: And as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Whatever is, is right.</Q></P>
<P>Nay, tho' I throw a Pair of Dice as high as the Monu|ment, there is a certain Law by which they will turn up that very Number that they do. And if they were thrown up by the &s;ame Force, in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, and every other Circum&s;tance &s;imilar, they mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity turn up the &s;ame again.</P></NOTE> Accident or other tho&s;e Parti|cles of Matter are <HI>broken, impar'd,</HI> or <HI>di&s;|united,</HI> and then the Soul cea&s;es to act. Now it is equally evident, that if a Child is be|gotten
<PB N="65" REF="73">
and naturally form'd in the Womb, with every Organ, Fibre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> perfect; it can no more fail of being agitated by a <HI>hu|man Soul,</HI> than a regular con&s;tructed Clock can forbear moving, or the Gunpowder for|bear giving a Concu&s;&s;ion, when touch'd by a Sparkle of Fire&mdash;and in each of the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Parallel is ju&s;t&mdash;for when the Clock is maim'd, or render'd imperfect, its Power <HI>cea&s;es,</HI> and as &s;oon as ever the volatile and combu&s;tible Parts of the Gunpowder are di&s;|pers'd, the <HI>Soul cea&s;es to exi&s;t, there is no more Power left.</HI> And thus it is with that <HI>free Agent, Man.</HI></P>
<P>Now, from the above In&s;tances, we &s;ee the Po&s;&s;ibility of Souls being created and de|&s;troy'd, as to their Exi&s;tence as &s;eparate Be|ings, with Ea&s;e. For we can't imagine that tho&s;e Powers, which acted on the Ball, on the Gunpowder, or on the Clock, to exi&s;t after the Di&s;per&s;ion or maiming of the U|nion of their proper Matter, acting on them|&s;elves, as the Soul of Man is &s;uppo&s;ed to do. If this were the Ca&s;e, almo&s;t every Action of our Lives would create a <HI>new Soul</HI>; and we &s;hould have the Univer&s;e &s;trangely &s;tock'd with active Beings. We mu&s;t conclude then that tho&s;e <HI>Powers</HI> or <HI>Souls</HI> are <HI>annihilated</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here then it is evident, that the greater Power will always annihilate the le&s;s, let the Properties of that Power or the Manner of its acting be what they will&mdash;whether weak or &s;trong, violent or progre&s;&s;ive, animate or in|animate.</NOTE>,
<PB N="66" REF="74">
or if there be any Idea of their exi&s;ting af|terwards, they mu&s;t be lo&s;t and mixed with the Power of the Univer&s;e, the Law of Na|ture.</P>
<P>Hence then, it is evident, that tho&s;e Pow|ers which act upon Men, on Brutes, and upon inanimate Things, are nothing more than <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> which is the Con&s;equence or the Effect of the <HI>divine Volition</HI> or <HI>Will:</HI> And that the&s;e Powers as &s;till Effects of the &s;ame Cau&s;e, whether they act rationally and on them&s;elves as in Men and Brutes, or by Nece&s;&s;ity and purely on Matter, as in Things inanimate: And certainly, <HI>if they are Effects of the &s;ame Cau&s;e, the Effects mu&s;t be all of the &s;ame Nature.</HI> And here then will appear the Probability of the Soul's Mortality or Ce&s;&s;ation of Being; by con&s;idering the Af|finity of the&s;e Powers or Souls. We &s;ee the Soul of a Man, at fir&s;t very weak; not at all capable, or but very faintly, of exerting its rational Faculties: By degrees it grows &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and acquires exten&s;ive Knowledge; till at length, in Old-age, not|with&s;tanding all its Acquirements, it grows exce&s;&s;ively weak and childi&s;h again.&mdash;It is true we &s;ee, in violent Powers, &s;uch as throw|ing a Ball, nothing but the gradual Decay; but in progre&s;&s;ive Powers, &s;uch as in tho&s;e of Plants, Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Things always deem'd inanimate, we &s;ee exactly &s;uch a Beginning, Progre&s;s and Decay.&mdash;If then we judge ju&s;tly,
<PB N="67" REF="75">
(and that is certainly the only right Way of judging) from <HI>&s;imilar Cau&s;es</HI> and <HI>Effects,</HI> is not here a Probability, nay, do not our Argu|ments, all put together, give us a demon&s;tra|tive Proof that the Soul cannot exi&s;t, as a Being in it&s;elf, when the Body becomes in|active;&mdash;in other Words, that it cannot be immortal.</P>
<P>Now from hence to form the mo&s;t ju&s;t Definition of a Deity, we mu&s;t conclude that <HI>God</HI> is in him&s;elf, nothing but <HI>Volition</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> will have God to be extended, and to be a <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> for, &s;ays he, <HI>Power without Sub&s;tance cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</HI> Now, God, con&s;idered as <HI>Will,</HI> mu&s;t be a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and as a <HI>Spirit,</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>Power,</HI> and as <HI>Power</HI> may bd <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI>; but, it is evident that God is not <HI>that Sub&s;tance</HI> which is the <HI>Power of Nature</HI> of which our Souls are, identically part; but he is that Will or Power which is the Cau&s;e of that Power of Nature.&mdash; Now while we are &s;o ignorant of what Kind of Sub&s;tance that Power or Spirit is (material Sub&s;tance it is al|lowed by all it cannot be) of which our Souls are Part, who can pretend to define what Kind of a Sub&s;tance, <HI>God</HI> is?&mdash;I think therefore, it is a little idle to pretend to &s;ay that <HI>God is Sub&s;tance</HI> at all; when we don't know what we mean by it.</NOTE> or a <HI>Will,</HI> and that that <HI>Power</HI> which has been called the <HI>Soul</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> calls <HI>God,</HI> is nothing more than the <HI>Effect</HI> of the divine <HI>Will</HI> or the <HI>Deity him&s;elf</HI>; that it is not the <HI>Being,</HI> but only a <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of the <HI>Being</HI> of God. So that whatever God <HI>wills,</HI> is by that Will, actually done: Becau&s;e <HI>Volition</HI> being a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and a <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Soul</HI> being nothing but <HI>Action,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="76">
God's Willing and Acting is exactly the &s;ame Thing. And thus he is the <HI>prime Cau&s;e</HI> of all Things: And this is all we can under|&s;tand, as to the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Being of a God.</HI>&mdash;For, to &s;ay the Deity is <HI>Power,</HI> or the Deity is <HI>Space,</HI> allows, from what I have proved, that we and every thing in Nature are iden|tically Part of the Divine Being; &s;ince we take up &s;ome <HI>Space,</HI> and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome <HI>Power</HI>&mdash; but it is plain neither <HI>Space</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> are, in them&s;elves, infinite Things; however they may &s;urpa&s;s our Comprehen|&s;ion: For we cannot allow <HI>Space</HI> to extend any further than <HI>God</HI> plea&s;es; and we &s;ee evidently that <HI>Power</HI> cannot exert it&s;elf a Jot further than the Will of its Creator a&s;&s;igns it. &mdash;Hence it is plain that <HI>Power</HI> is a <HI>Being</HI> capable of Re&s;traint, and entirely acted on by the <HI>Deity</HI>; and is infinite no otherwi&s;e than, as con&s;ider'd capable of executing the mo&s;t <HI>infinite</HI> and <HI>unbounded</HI> Commands of the <HI>Deity</HI>; and <HI>Space</HI> is <HI>infinite</HI> no otherwi&s;e than that <HI>wherever Power</HI> is, it there finds <HI>Space</HI>&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e we give up Space as a <HI>Being,</HI> and &s;ay it is nothing&mdash;then we &s;hall &s;ay, how exten&s;ive &s;oever is Power, it meets with no Ob&s;truction or Want of Space to act in.</P>
<P>But here now may ari&s;e an Objection a|gain&s;t this Definition of God, from our hav|ing proved the Mortality of the Soul.&mdash;For you may &s;ay, that the Power of Volition or the Will found in Man, mu&s;t be &s;imilar to the

Nature of the Deity, and may have Immor|tality annexed to it.&mdash;In An&s;wer to this I &s;ay,</P>
<P>It is evident that <HI>Will</HI> con&s;idered as <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Will</HI> in <HI>Man</HI> have no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Con|nection; for the Volition of God, or, <HI>God him|&s;elf,</HI> is the &s;ole <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of all <HI>Power,</HI> and the <HI>Will</HI> in <HI>Man</HI> is only, as it were, a <HI>Property</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Power</HI> in a very narrow Degree: For the <HI>Will</HI> acts &s;ub&s;ervient to every other Faculty of the Soul. I cannot per|ceive what I will&mdash;I cannot think what I will, nor <HI>how</HI> I will&mdash;I cannot think <HI>two</HI> and <HI>two</HI> make <HI>five,</HI> tho' I would ever &s;o fain; neither can I think any thing <HI>doth not &s;tand</HI> before me, which I &s;ee and know actually <HI>doth &s;tand</HI> there; tho' I exert the &s;tronge&s;t Act of Volition I am capable of. So, in forming Propo&s;itions&mdash;I cannot draw what Conclu&s;ion I <HI>will,</HI> from &s;uppo&s;ed Conce&s;&s;ions or known Facts, but mu&s;t draw that which the Power of Rea&s;on tells me nece&s;&s;arily fol|lows. Thus not one Act of the Soul is &s;ub|ject to the Will of Man. And we &s;ee that Brutes and Idiots have often a greater Share of Will than the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Philo&s;opher. &mdash;The Matter of the Body indeed is &s;ub|ject to <HI>Will,</HI> and that is all&mdash;and that, but in &s;ome Ca&s;es; for if a Man's Leg is broke, he may <HI>will</HI> long enough before it will move. Shall we then give up the Powers of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to <HI>Annihilation,</HI> and &s;cruple to give up the Will, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and bea&s;tly Faculty
<PB N="70" REF="78">
of the Soul, acting &s;o much beneath its other Faculties, that it &s;eems rather to be a <HI>Pro|perty annexed to the Soul</HI> than any thing <HI>e&s;|&s;ential to it.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure you will &s;ay, No; if we give up the other Powers, the <HI>Will</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow; for where there is neither <HI>Perception</HI> or <HI>Reflection,</HI> there can be no <HI>Will.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that the Will of God or the <HI>Deity,</HI> is the &s;ole Cau&s;e of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Power; and the Will of Man but, at be&s;t, the meane&s;t Faculty of a very &s;mall and li|mited Portion of that Power. Where is then the Similarity? Here is neither the Cau&s;e of the &s;ame Effect, nor the Effect of the &s;ame Cau&s;e.&mdash;It is plain then, they are not e&s;&s;entially in any degree the &s;ame. And as this is our only Way of judging rightly, here evidently appears the Rea&s;on why we cannot judge of the E&s;&s;ence of God; <HI>becau&s;e we can|not rea&s;on but from what we know.</HI> Now all we know is, that all Power is the Effect of the Being of God. Hence we have <HI>God</HI> as the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> the <HI>Effect:</HI> But do we know the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of any <HI>other Effect &s;imilar</HI> to <HI>Power</HI>; if we did, we might then judge of <HI>God,</HI> and &s;ay he was <HI>like</HI> that <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> We may &s;ay, indeed, God is <HI>all-wi&s;e, all Ju&s;tice, all Goodne&s;s,</HI> and the like.&mdash;But what are tho&s;e Things we call <HI>Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI>&mdash;Why, they are Ideas, which are the Effects of a <HI>&s;mall</HI> Part of that mo&s;t <HI>ex|ten&s;ive</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="79">
Power, which is the <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Shall we then <HI>patch</HI> up a <HI>God,</HI> with the Ef|fects of <HI>part</HI> of a <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> which <HI>whole Cau&s;e</HI> is the <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>him&s;elf?</HI> Is this doing Honour to God? No&mdash;Let us &s;ay then, that <HI>God</HI> is <HI>the Cau&s;e of all Things,</HI> and there put an end to our Enquiries; for we have not Ground to &s;tep one Foot further.</P>
<P>This, Reader, is the Effect of my fir&s;t ra|tional Enquiry into the Nature and Depen|dency of my own Being. The Tendency of inculcating and publi&s;hing this Doctrine, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould fore&s;ee: But I cannot think it will at all hurt the Morality of tho&s;e who under&s;tand it; but will rather lead them to admire and adore the <HI>Infinity</HI> of that <HI>God,</HI> in whom our Ideas and Rea&s;onings are lo&s;t; as well as excite them to that general Hu|manity, that &s;hould be extended to every liv|ing Creature, to make them <HI>encourage</HI> tho&s;e which are <HI>in&s;trumental,</HI> and to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> tho&s;e which are <HI>prejudicial</HI> to the <HI>greate&s;t general Good,</HI> in whatever Order of Beings they may exi&s;t. Hence will follow the Idea of Virtue, and the Ju&s;tice will appear evident, in <HI>killing a mad Dog,</HI> in the lawful Execution of a vil|lainous Man, or in de&s;troying every offen&s;ive Animal. But after all, I am &s;o <HI>willing</HI> to <HI>believe,</HI> even to <HI>de&s;ire</HI> the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> (that is, a Capacity of retaining tho&s;e Ideas I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in this World) that I

heartily and &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee the&s;e Rea|&s;ons I have here given, confuted and prov'd erroneous, and promi&s;e the World, that if ever I &s;hould be of a contrary Opinion, I will undoubtedly give them my Rea&s;ons for re|nouncing what I have here written.</P>
