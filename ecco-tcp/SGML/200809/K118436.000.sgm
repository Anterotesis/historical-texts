<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS Upon the Augmentation of the ARMY on the ESTABLISHMENT of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Scheme for augmenting the Army on the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of <HI>Ireland</HI> with three Thou|&s;and two Hundred and thirty-five Men, excites a good deal of Curio|&s;ity at pre&s;ent, it may not be un|acceptable to the Public, to know what are the Sentiments of a &s;incere Well-wi&s;her to his Country, unin|fluenced by Pa&s;&s;ion, Prejudice, or private Intere&s;t, upon this very im|portant Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">THE Objections which have been yet urged again&s;t this Mea&s;ure, even with any Degree of Plau&s;ibility, may be fairly reduced within a very narrow Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Expence to be incurr'd the fir&s;t Year, of near &s;eventy Thou&s;and Pounds, and the annual Expence afterwards, of a|bout thirty-five Thou&s;and, for the Support of this increa&s;ed E&s;tabli&s;h|ment. The Probability that twelve thou&s;and Men will not remain in <HI>Ireland</HI> for the Defence of the Country: And the Inexpediency of increa&s;ing our military Force in a Time of Peace, and apparent Security.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed, that this, and every other Scheme of public
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Utility, could be carried into Exe|cution, without laying the &s;malle&s;t Burthen upon the People: But as this in the Beginning, has &s;eldom been found practicable in any Age, or Country; let us examine the Weight of the fir&s;t Objection, upon the fair Footing of a Compari&s;on between the &s;light Inconvenience of rai&s;ing the Sums requi&s;ite for this Purpo&s;e, and the great Advantages derived to this Kingdom from &s;o prudent and nece&s;&s;ary an Applica|tion of them. A <HI>&s;light</HI> Inconvenience it may well be called, for by the equitable Tax of four Shillings in the Pound impo&s;ed upon Ab&s;entees this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and by the contingent Produce of the al|tered Duty upon Teas, a new Fund will be added to the Revenue nearly equal (according to the be&s;t Calcu|lations)
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to the whole annual Charge of the propo&s;ed Augmentation: And this too without any Oppre&s;&s;ion to the landed or mercantile Intere&s;t of the Country.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that for a mo|derate Sum, not exceeding what may, perhaps, be &s;pent in vicious Ho&s;pi|tality, at two or three conte&s;ted County Elections, a re&s;pectable Body of Forces may be maintained in this Country, to protect us from In&s;ur|rections at Home, and again&s;t Inva|&s;ions from Abroad; the Reliefs which <HI>Ireland</HI> is to furni&s;h to Garri&s;ons, and Settlements, will be compleat. and regular; and our Army no longer &s;ubject to that pernicious, (though hitherto unavoidable) Practice of Draughting, which like a &s;low Di&s;|temper, has con&s;umed the Vigor of our &s;toute&s;t Corps.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">BUT it will be &s;aid, what Pledge is given us, that twelve Thou&s;and Men will continue in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to de|fend the Country that &s;upports them? Superadded to the Faith of the Royal Declaration, to this Ef|fect, we have the Security of an Act of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature, which, while it enables his Maje&s;ty to aug|ment his Army, &s;pecifies at the &s;ame Time, the Place and Purpo&s;e of their Service: And in the Ballance of Candor and Ju&s;tice, &s;uch A&s;&s;u|rances will certainly preponderate a|gain&s;t the vague Conjectures of un|inform'd Writers, or the jealous A&s;|&s;ertions of a peevi&s;h and turbulent Incendiary. It requires no very com|prehen&s;ive Memory to regi&s;ter En|gagements from the Throne, which have been entered into &s;ince his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion, and till &s;ome Violation of them is charged and proved, we may, I think &s;afely rely upon the Honour of our Sove|reign, that he will give no Rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t his want of a Principle, which among the lowe&s;t Orders of his Subjects, is &s;carcely dignified with the Name of a Virtue, but is rather con&s;idered as an indi&s;pen&s;able Rule of Morality, which Men mu&s;t not depart from, while they expect to live with ordinary Credit in So|ciety, and to reap the Benefits, which, Truth, the great Bond of it, intitles them to.</P>
<P>IN Time of Peace, to be pre|pared for War, is a Maxim of &s;ound Policy in every Country: To none can it be more applicable than to
<PB N="9" REF="8">
ours, no where &s;hould it be more frequently inculcated, and no where does it &s;eem le&s;s under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The Fertility of our I&s;land invites, and its Acce&s;&s;ability expo&s;es us to Inva&s;ion. We mu&s;t &s;till con&s;ider the two great Monarchies of the Con|tinent as in&s;eparably united by Com|pact, by joint Intere&s;t, and join Am|bition. <HI>France,</HI> which has long in|fluenced the Councils, and &s;o lately guided the Arms of <HI>Spain,</HI> is aver&s;e to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from Commercial Emulation, from the recent Di&s;|honour of her Arms, and from long Habits of Ho&s;tility. The compli|cated Intere&s;ts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colo|nies, her numerous Dependancies, and enterpri&s;ing Spirit, may ea&s;ily furni&s;h a Pretence to the&s;e two
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Powers for a Rupture with her, when they are again in a Condi|tion to bu&s;tle for Dominion, and the next War may probably begin, where the la&s;t pretty nearly conclu|ded, with another Attempt to invade us. Expelled, as France is, from the Continent of <HI>North America,</HI> her Efforts will be exerted &s;lowly, if ever, to regain a Footing in that Quarter. Her Fleets can't cope with tho&s;e of <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the Leeward I&s;lands; the Settlements in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are too re|mote and well e&s;tabli&s;hed: And the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Minorca</HI> and <HI>Gibralter,</HI> are now rendered almo&s;t impregna|ble.&mdash;What Object then remains &s;o inviting? What enterprize &s;o practi|cable as a De&s;cent upon <HI>Ireland?</HI> Abounding with Harbours, Bays and
<PB N="11" REF="10">
landing Places; unfurni&s;hed with Forts and Soldiers: Where too, the unhappy Prevalence of the Religion of our Enemies, which keeps much the greate&s;t Number of our Coun|trymen in a di&s;contented and fearful Subjection to the Government they live under, renders their Loyalty &s;u&s;picious; and in this Re&s;pect, Po|pulation, one great Means of Safe|ty in other States, &s;ugge&s;ts nothing to us, but the Idea of Danger. A little Attention to the internal Con|dition of this Kingdom, will be &s;uf|ficient to convince every impartial Per&s;on, that this De&s;cription is not overloaded, and it would be well no Doubt, if &s;uch a State of Imbecility could not be aggravated.&mdash;The ha&s;ty Charts of Geographers who &s;eldom vi&s;it the Countries the pre|tend
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to delineate, but deliver to the World Errors taken upon the Credit of tho&s;e who went before them: The Intelligence of Merchants, or more inaccurate De&s;criptions of &s;uch as travel from Curio&s;ity, or for Amu&s;ement, are the Means by which Countries are generally known to each other, and many ho&s;tile Pro|jects have been formed, upon &s;uch fallible Authorities, and many have mi&s;carried becau&s;e they were &s;o form|ed.&mdash;In re&s;pect to <HI>Ireland,</HI> an Ene|my has peculiar Advantages. Men born and educated in every Province, in every Town, in every Corner and Spot of this I&s;land, are to be found in the Dominions and under the Al|legiance of France and Spain. They have our Natives to fill their Levies, and our Mariners to Pilot their Ve&s;|&s;els.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
The very Indigence of the&s;e Fugitives renders them formidable, as it drives them to embrace a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion in the&s;e martial Governments, which furni&s;hes an immediate Sub|&s;i&s;tence; and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to be any Thing at home, they be|come Soldiers from Nece&s;&s;ity abroad. Let us not de&s;pi&s;e their rude Educa|tion and uncultivated Talents, they have Science enough to be u&s;eful to our Enemies, and dangerous to us. <HI>Ireland</HI> they &s;till con&s;ider as their natural Inheritance, and the Claim of original Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is tran&s;mitted among&s;t them from Generation to Generation. To revi&s;it the Land of their Fore-fathers, and to enjoy again the Property they have forfeit|ed, is the favourite Topic of their Di&s;cour&s;es, and the Object ever pre|&s;ent
<PB N="14" REF="13">
to their Hopes. Bold and rea|dy for Battle upon any Pretence, and in every Quarrel, they are ani|mated with no common Ardor when this Enterprize is &s;tarted. Innova|tors and Robbers are the Characters we are de&s;cribed under; and, as &s;uch, &s;hould the fatal Opportunity happen, we mu&s;t expect to be treat|ed. It is a fact too notorious to be conte&s;ted, and too recent to be for|gotten, how we were once pre&s;erved from the wor&s;t of all Calamities which hung over us; and had not the &s;uperintending Vigilance of our Mother Country interpo&s;ed at that Juncture, we might now perhaps in Poverty, in Bani&s;hment, or in Pri|&s;ons deplore the Con&s;equences of an Event, which, whether we may be again expo&s;ed to it, or not, we at
<PB N="15" REF="14">
pre&s;ent only di&s;cu&s;s the Probability of.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are candid enough to acknowledge what indeed can &s;carcely be conte&s;ted, that the Con|que&s;t of Ireland, at lea&s;t the De|va&s;tation of it, will be a likely Ob|ject of our Enemies Policy; but who argue that even a greater Number than our propo&s;ed E&s;|tabli&s;hment would be in&s;ufficient to defend it; the An&s;wer is obvious. Twelve Thou&s;and Men are a better Defence than a third Part of the Number, and three times as much may rea&s;onably be expected from them. Open the above Argument a little more, place it in a fairer Light, and then examine what is the Force of it. Our I&s;land is ex|ten&s;ive,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and expo&s;ed every where; then how is it po&s;&s;ible for a handful of Soldiers, though never &s;o brave, alert, and well di&s;ciplined, to be pre&s;ent at the &s;ame In&s;tant in many Places? The Attack may be made at once in different Quarters, and while we March to &s;u&s;tain one Po&s;t, we leave another open to the Inva|dor? Be&s;ides, a watchful Eye mu&s;t be kept upon the People who &s;ur|round us, le&s;t their Ri&s;ing &s;hould be as fatal as the landing of an Ene|my.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch Circum&s;tances it mu&s;t be admitted, that an Army would have much to do, and all Lovers of their Country much more to fear. At &s;uch a Cri&s;is, the thrif|tie&s;t Stewards of the public Pur&s;e,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the mo&s;t watchful Dragons of the Exchequer, might probably wi&s;h in vain to make one common Ma&s;s of public and private Property; and to exchange it all for what is &s;till more precious, &s;ecurity of Life, and Li|berty to enjoy it. Yet from twelve thou&s;and brave Soldiers, every Thing may be expected but Impo&s;&s;ibilities: nor can it be &s;trictly &s;aid, that we need defend equally the whole of our exten&s;ive Coa&s;ts, &s;ince 'tis pro|bable the Northern Parts of them will not be attempted. The Reli|gion of the Inhabitants, their Wealth and Numbers, are well known to the two Maritime Powers from whence we have any Thing to apprehend: nor &s;hould it be &s;uppo|&s;ed they will endeavour to make an
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Impre&s;&s;ion in the Quarter, where they mu&s;t expect to meet the mo&s;t vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance. The landing of <HI>Flobert</HI> and <HI>Thurot</HI> near <HI>Carrick|fergus,</HI> in the Year 1760, was the Effect of Accident and not De&s;ign. The De&s;tination of that little Squa|dron ('tis well known) was for the South, though by Di&s;tre&s;s, and con|trary Winds, they were reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Anchoring in the North; where it was not at fir&s;t in|tended. 'Tis then rea&s;onable to conclude, that the Southern, and South-We&s;t Parts, are to be princi|pally attended to; as the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons which endangered them before, exi&s;t in full Force at this In&s;tant. Here then we mu&s;t be prepared to expect an Enemy, and 'tis &s;omething at lea&s;t in our Favour, to know
<PB N="19" REF="18">
where Preparation is nece&s;&s;ary. Let it be con&s;idered be&s;ides, that no Armament can Approach the Coa&s;t, without giving Notice of it by their Appearance: And that Di&s;embarka|tions are more &s;ubject to Delay, Confu&s;ion and Accident, than any other Military Operations.</P>
<P>The Strength and Spirit of the Soldiery, upon &s;uch Services, is en|feebled by the unwhole&s;ome Con|finement in the Ve&s;&s;els that tran&s;|port them, and by the Effects of an Element to which they are not ac|cu&s;tomed. If they meet with no Oppo&s;ition, but can Di&s;embark, Form and March forwards with as little Re&s;i&s;tance, and in as good Order, as if they came to relieve a Garri&s;on, or to take quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of an undi&s;puted Territory, the Ca&s;e is very different; if &s;o indeed, I know not what we have to re&s;ort to, except Supplications, and their Mercy; but in my poor Opinion, the Appearance of a &s;ingle Regi|ment or Company of our own Sol|diers, would be a much &s;afer, and more honourable Re&s;ource in &s;uch a Calamity. Pea&s;ants, Children and Women have hurled &s;tones, and brandi&s;hed Clubs, have done &s;ome|thing, in &s;uch Cau&s;es; and &s;hall we now be told, that twelve thou&s;and brave Soldiers, &s;uch as by their excellent Di&s;cipline and unexampled Courage, have rai&s;ed the Reputati|on of the&s;e Nations above all others this Day in Europe: Shall we be told, I &s;ay, that they can do no|thing? And will it &s;till be urged
<PB N="21" REF="20">
that except their Numbers are en|crea&s;ed beyond what 'tis po&s;&s;ible to encrea&s;e them, they are a Burthen and not a Bulwark.</P>
<P>Much illiberal Indu&s;try 'tis true has been of late exerted to rai&s;e un|favourable Impre&s;&s;ions of the Soldi|ery in the Minds of their Country|men, and impotent Malice has ex|hau&s;ted all her pitiful Expedients, to &s;ow the Seeds of Divi&s;ion and Jealou&s;y, between the Civil and Military Powers. Invidious In&s;inu|ations, invented Anecdotes, ridicu|lous Calculations, fal&s;e Facts, fal&s;e Arguments, and bold Calumnies have been obtruded upon the Pub|lic, for Rea&s;ons to Prejudice their Sen&s;e of a Mea&s;ure, which is &s;hort|ly
<PB N="22" REF="21">
to be decided by their Repre&s;en|tatives in Parliament. <HI>There no doubt,</HI> the Merit of this Que&s;tion will be determined properly upon the Information which is before them: They will not prefer an in|con&s;iderable Saving to a great Se|curity, nor &s;u&s;pect a lurking Mi&s;|chief under a fair Propo&s;ition, be|cau&s;e they have not them&s;elves &s;ug|ge&s;ted it. As the Crown advances in Conde&s;cen&s;ion, they will not recede in Confidence, nor while the Nece&s;|&s;ity of an additional Defence to their Country, is on all Sides admitted; po&s;tpone an expeditious and practi|cable Mode of defending it, to one which is vi&s;ionary, or at be&s;t precari|ous. In examining the Scheme be|fore them, they will con&s;ider all the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Relations of their Country, and re|&s;pect the Means propo&s;ed; as they regard one great End, its Security and Pre&s;ervation.</P>
