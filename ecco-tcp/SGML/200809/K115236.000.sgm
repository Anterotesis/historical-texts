<HEAD>ON THE CULTURE AND CURING OF MADDER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. ARBUTHNOT.</BYLINE>
<P>IF it is required to e&s;tabli&s;h a plantation of Madder, to which plants mu&s;t be brought from a foreign country, they mu&s;t be winter plants, which are pieces of the main root on which are many buds; the&s;e are to be had in the latter end of autumn or &s;pring, when the crop is taken up. The be&s;t method is to pack them in &s;and, as the buds will &s;hoot; the ground &s;hould be extremely rich, a &s;andy loom, and perfectly clean; furrows &s;hould be made about a foot a&s;under and about four inches deep; &s;trew the pieces of root and any of the yellow &s;hoots, that are broken off, ju&s;t &s;uffici|ently
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to cover the bottom, and earth them. In the month of April there will appear numberle&s;s &s;hoots, which &s;hould be kept very clean, and a little fine mould thrown over them to lengthen the &s;tem, which are the &s;pring plants; when the &s;hoots are about &s;ix or eight inches above ground, they are fit to draw, but care mu&s;t be taken to pull them up with as long a &s;tem as po&s;&s;ible, as that becomes the principal part of the crop; the earth mu&s;t be loo&s;ened by an old trowel or any &s;uch like in&s;trument to facilitate the drawing of the plants, but it mu&s;t be done with care, as in a few days time there will be a fre&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plants like a&s;paragus. The above are merely di|rections for the nur&s;ery, which may be dug up for crop when all the plants are obtained; for the repeated pulling will &s;o weaken the roots, as to render them not worth &s;tanding for crop; for want of this precaution many people injure their crop by drawing plants from it, in&s;tead of plant|ing a &s;mall patch as above de&s;cribed for a nur&s;ery. It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, that you will obtain the longe&s;t and be&s;t plants from the fir&s;t year's growth, as the original plant or mother root is much deeper, than the crowns of the plants will be by earthing.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
The land for the crop &s;hould be as for the nur&s;ery a rich mellow loam, either hazle, or black; it cannot be too rich, and mu&s;t be per|fectly clean; it mu&s;t be ploughed as deep as the good &s;oil will admit of the preceding year of planting. Soil, that will not admit of ploughing eighteen inches deep at lea&s;t, is not fit for madder. It mu&s;t be laid up in high four feet lands before winter, that it may be &s;ufficiently dry for working in the &s;pring; for unle&s;s the land is in exceeding good tilth when you plant, it is in vain to attempt it.</P>
<P>The land &s;hould therefore have one good ploughing in the &s;pring, partly to de&s;troy any weeds, which may have grown during the winter, as likewi&s;e to enliven the &s;oil, but it mu&s;t be when the land is perfectly dry; as &s;oon as your plants are ready, which will be in April, &s;lit down two furrows one foot a&s;under from the crown of the land as thus;
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
then lay the plants again&s;t the &s;ides of the fur|rows about &s;ix inches a&s;under, with their heads
<PB N="4" REF="6">
leaning to each other; this operation may be performed by women and children, who are followed by men, who with hoes cover the plants with the mould, that was thrown out by the plough; when this is done, the lands will ap|pear thus,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the plants lying as de&s;cribed. Unle&s;s it is rainy weather when your plants are drawn, they &s;hould be dipped in water the moment they are pulled, and kept quite wet till plant|ed; and, if the land is dry, it will be requi&s;ite to give a good watering the evening of the plant|ing; for, as the plants are extremely &s;ucculent, in that proportion they dry up the fa&s;ter, and will &s;hrink to the &s;ize of a &s;traw. If the plants do not &s;trike immediately, they are not worth &s;tanding; they are in the greate&s;t perfection for pulling, when &s;mall fibres begin to pu&s;h all around them. As &s;oon as you perceive, that the plants have &s;truck vigorou&s;ly, hoe the ground well round and be|tween them, &s;o as to loo&s;en the &s;oil well, and make it perfectly pervious to the young fibres; as
<PB N="5" REF="7">
it is the vigour of the fir&s;t year's growth, which is to &s;ecure you a plentiful crop. After this opera|tion you are only to take care, that no weeds grow during the &s;ummer, which mu&s;t be by hand weeding, and &s;uperficial hoeing; for the roots, which are the crop, mu&s;t be carefully pre|&s;erved from injury; therefore great care mu&s;t be taken to watch and de&s;troy moles, which always frequent rich land in &s;earch of worms, which they feed on. When weeding and hoeing the crop, draw a little light mould from the &s;ides of the land to nouri&s;h the crowns as much as po&s;&s;ible. In autumn, when the haulm dies, cover the whole over three inches deep, to pre&s;erve the crowns of the plants from fro&s;t, and the haulm rotting in the ground is beneficial, and keeps the ground loo&s;e; this earthing mu&s;t be done from the intervals, which con&s;equently &s;hould be oc|ca&s;ionally worked with a light plough or hor&s;e hoe during the &s;ummer. Open the water furrows well again&s;t winter, that no water may lie. As early in the &s;pring as the weather will permit, the whole plantation &s;hould be carefully weeded over, but great attention mu&s;t be paid to the not de&s;troying of the buds, which will be near the &s;urface waiting for warm weather to pu&s;h. Such
<PB N="6" REF="8">
land as I de&s;cribe, being made rich, will be very &s;ubject to chickweed, and if it is not checked in time, it will greatly &s;mother the crop and exhau&s;t the moi&s;ture from the &s;urface of the &s;oil. The remainder of the &s;econd year's practice &s;hould be as the fir&s;t, re&s;pecting hand weeding and &s;light &s;uperficial hoeing, and earthing on the haulm in autumn; indeed the more you can earth the plants in the time of growing the better, as it will produce a greater quantity of roots; but each year, you mu&s;t be more careful in not di&s;turbing the &s;ides of the lands, as the &s;hoots will run like a&s;paragus; thus at la&s;t you have only a deep furrow between the lands. Some people take up the crop the &s;econd year, but I prefer three years growth: the great expence being the preparing the land, planting, and taking up the crop, I have ever found the third year pay largely for the rent and tithes; the labour of hoeing is the lea&s;t, and not nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;o very minute|ly attended to, though large weeds mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to grow. The Dutch take it up at two years old, which from their mode of planting is right; they plant very thick on beds, from which circum&s;tance their plants cannot come to any &s;ize. But I di&s;approve of that method, as it is the interior part of the roots, which produces the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
valuable madder, con&s;equently the larger the root, the greater is the proportion of the be&s;t quality. I have traced the age of &s;ome Turkey roots to fifteen years old; they were become a &s;olid wood all of the be&s;t quality, the&s;e mu&s;t have grown wild.</P>
<P>The general practice of taking up the crop is by the &s;pade. I did it with a large plough, which &s;truck a clean furrow of above twenty inches deep; men, women, and boys followed the plough, and threw out the roots. The dirt &s;hould be &s;hook out of them as much as po&s;&s;ible, then carry them every day out of the field to be dried in the &s;hade; when perfectly dry, mo&s;t of the remainder of the dirt will &s;hake out, fir&s;t beating the roots to pieces with poles or flails. They mu&s;t then be dried on a kiln: the one I built was of the annexed form,

<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
The madder mu&s;t be frequently turned, and will be dry enough for grinding in twenty four hours. The fir&s;t time, that it goes under the &s;tones, requires but a few minutes; it mu&s;t be &s;ifted and produces a very inferior &s;pecies, which is the out|ward coat or rind. The remainder is returned to the &s;tones, and is kept there till the eye tells you that the interior part begins to grind, which di&s;|covers it&s;elf by the palene&s;s of the colour. If you require the be&s;t &s;ort to be very fine, you continue this &s;econd grinding a little longer, in &s;hort till all the rind is pulled off; it mu&s;t be then &s;ifted, and the remainder put again under the &s;tones and ground till fine enough for u&s;e. Each &s;ort &s;hould be ca&s;ked up &s;eparately, and kept in a dry place where no moi&s;ture can affect it; care &s;hould like|wi&s;e be taken to pre&s;s the madder well down in the ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>There are various &s;orts of madder differing greatly from each other both in appearance, and value. The &s;ort I prefer is the Turkey, being more vigorous, and of a darker green. It like|wi&s;e produces abundance of &s;eed, which the com|mon &s;ort does not; it puts out many vigorous and &s;olid runners, whereas the runners of the com|mon
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&s;pecies are hollow, and produce none of the be&s;t part of the madder, which is contained in the woody part of the root.</P>
<P>My mills con&s;i&s;ted of two vertical &s;tones, that run on a bed &s;tone, &s;uch as they u&s;e for grinding gunpowder, dye woods &amp;c.</P>
