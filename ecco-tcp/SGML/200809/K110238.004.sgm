<P>I AM caught, Fairfax! Spring guns and man traps have been &s;et for me, and I am legged! Me&s;hed! Shot through the heart! I have been their puppet! They have led me, with a &s;tring through my no&s;e, a fine dance! From the far|the&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">
part of all Italy here to London, in order to tie me up! Noo&s;e me with a wife! And, what is more &s;trange, I am thanking and prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing them for it, in &s;pite of my teeth! I &s;wallow the do&s;e as eagerly as if it had been pre|pared and &s;weetened by my own hand; and it appears I have had nothing to do in the matter! I am a mere automaton; and as &s;uch they have treated me!</P>
<P>Is it not cur&s;ed odd that I cannot be angry? And yet, when I recollect all this, I really &s;u&s;pect I am not plea&s;ed. Damn it! To be made their convenient uten&s;il! To be packed up, their very obedient jack in a bandbox, and with a proper label on my back, po&s;ted with other lumber from city to city, over hills and &s;eas, to be taken out and looked
<PB N="3" REF="4">
at, and if not liked returned as damaged ware! Ought I to &s;neak and &s;ubmit to this? Tell me, will not the court of ho|nour hoot me out of its precincts? Will not the very footmen point after me, with a&mdash;"There goes the gentleman that mi&s;s had upon liking?" Why it is not yet full two months, &s;ince I was the very prince of high blooded noble &s;port&s;men, in the romantic manors, do|mains, coverts and coveys of Venus! By what &s;trange necromancy am I thus metamorpho&s;ed, thus tamed?</P>
<P>I feel my&s;elf a hu&s;band by anticipa|tion! I am become as pretty a mode&s;t, well-behaved, &s;ober, &s;entimental gentle|man, as any you &s;hall &s;ee on a &s;ummer's day! I get phra&s;es by rote, and repeat them too! I &s;ay "God ble&s;s you, ma|dam,"
<PB N="4" REF="5">
when the cat &s;neezes: and mum|ble amen to grace after meat!</P>
<P>I told you that I had my catechi&s;m to learn; and, what is wor&s;e, it is not the que&s;tions and commands of good old mother church, with all the chance-medley promi&s;es and vows of godfathers and godmothers made in my name, [For which, by the bye, I think both godfathers and godmothers are fools, and knaves.] but I have the Lord knows how much more to learn than ever I &s;up|po&s;ed the mo&s;t outrageous morality could have exacted. And I am obliged to an&s;wer yes, and no, and I thank you kindly, while my finger's ends are &s;moking, tingling, and aching under the &s;troke of the ferula! Yes! I, Coke Clifton, with my &s;weetmeats in one hand
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and my horn-book in the other, am whipped till I pule, coaxed till I am quiet, and &s;ent &s;upperle&s;s to bed, if I pre&s;ume to murmur!</P>
<P>Why what the devil is the Engli&s;h of all this, &s;ay you, Clifton? What does it mean? My head is &s;o full of it, and I have it &s;o all by rote my&s;elf, that it had totally e&s;caped me that every word I have uttered mu&s;t be heathen Greek to you. Nay I had forgotten to tell you we have changed the &s;cene, which now is London.</P>
<P>And as for accidents, by &s;ea and land, why we have had &s;ome of them too. Frank Henley has again &s;hewn his dexterity. I could eat my fingers, to think that he &s;hould hit upon a certain and &s;afe mode of acting, in a moment
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of danger, fooner than I! But &s;o it is. He &s;eems born to cro&s;s me! We &s;hould all have been to&s;&s;ed into the &s;ea, and &s;ome of us certainly drowned at the very water's edge, if we had not been alert. He took the command upon him&s;elf, as imperiou&s;ly as if it were his by right indi&s;|putable; and I &s;aw no expedient but to obey, or perhaps behold her peri&s;h. For cur&s;e upon me if I know whether any other motive, on earth, could have induced me to act as his &s;ubordinate. But, as it was, I did as he bid me; and &s;at grinding my teeth at the helm, while I &s;aw him reap all the honour of taking her in his arms; and after her the re&s;t, and landing them in &s;afety! If, Fair|fax, you can conceive any angui&s;h on earth more excruciating than this, why
<PB N="7" REF="8">
tell it; and you &s;hall be appointed head-tormentor to the infernal regions, for your ingenuity!</P>
<P>What was I going to &s;ay?&mdash;My brain is as murky as the clouds under which I am writing&mdash;Oh!&mdash;I recollect&mdash;She had no hand in &s;preading the trammel, into which, buzzard like, I have been lured. It was the &s;cheme of my very good and careful mother; for which I have been very &s;incerely writing her a letter with more thanks than words; and of the wi&s;e Sir Arthur; who, wi&s;e though he be, is not one of the magi. She knew nothing of it for &s;ome time, nor would have known but for my commu|nicative &s;i&s;ter; and, as &s;he &s;corns de|ception, for by my &s;oul &s;he &s;corns every thing that is ba&s;e, or derogatory, it was
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;he who informed me of the trap in which I have been taken; of which other|wi&s;e perhaps I might have remained in eternal ignorance.</P>
<P>But &s;till and once again, &s;ay you, what trap? What do you mean?&mdash;</P>
<P>Three words will explain the whole.</P>
<P>I have been brought from Naples to Paris, not as I &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ettle a few paltry debts of a decea&s;ed uncle, but to &s;ee, fall in love with, and be rib-hooked to this angel. This my good mother as I under&s;tand thinks the kinde&s;t act of her life.&mdash;Nay, I think &s;o too; and yet I am not &s;atisfied. And merely I &s;up|po&s;e becau&s;e I feel I have been tricked. I will not be the gull of man or woman. What is it to me that they mean me well? I will judge for my&s;elf.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
It is in&s;olent in any one to pretend to know what befits me better than I my|&s;elf know.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I would quarrel, and bounce, and cur&s;e a little, if I knew how&mdash;But they offer an apology &s;o ample, &s;o irre|&s;i&s;tible, that there is no demanding to exchange a &s;hort; they pre&s;ent Anna St. Ives as their excu&s;e, and a fico for re&s;entment.</P>
<P>And now there is nothing on earth for which I &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;h as to be yoked! What think you, Fairfax; &s;hall I bear my &s;lavi&s;h trappings proudly? Shall I champ upon the bit, and prance, and curvet, and &s;hew off to advantage? I doubt I &s;hall &s;tand in need of a little rough riding. And yet I know not; let her but pat me on the neck, and
<PB N="10" REF="11">
whi&s;per two or three kind epithets in my ear, and &s;he will guide me as &s;he plea&s;es: at lea&s;t &s;he does. No! Hopes there are none of my ever again return|ing to my native wilds, and delightful haunts! Never was &s;een &s;o fond a booby as I am, and am likely to re|main!</P>
<P>Nor do I believe I &s;hould grumble, had &s;he not &s;uch a &s;uperabundance of di&s;cretion. She &s;miles upon me it is true; is all gentlene&s;s, all benevolence; but then &s;he does ju&s;t the &s;ame to every body el&s;e. For my part, I &s;ee no difference; except that I &s;ometimes think &s;he has a kinder &s;mile for Frank Henley than &s;he ever yet had for me! But he is ju&s;t as di&s;creet as her&s;elf; &s;o that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be jealous.
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Yet jealous I am! Ay and jealous I &s;hould be of my cat, if &s;he were as ready to purr and rear her back to be &s;troked by every coar&s;e unwa&s;hed hand as by mine.</P>
<P>Is it not a cur&s;ed &s;hame that, when you feel a continual propen&s;ity to quarrel with a man, he &s;hould be &s;uch a prince Prim as never to give you an opportu|nity? And why have I this propen|&s;ity?&mdash;I know not!&mdash;Confound the fel|low, why does he make him&s;elf &s;o great a favourite? Why does he not contrive to be hated a little? And then perhaps I might be induced to love him. I di&s;like to have friend&s;hip or affection forced upon me, as a duty. I abhor duties, as I do &s;hackles and dungeons. Let me do what I like. I leave others to examine whether or no my conduct
<PB N="12" REF="13">
be rational: 'tis too much trouble for me.</P>
<P>This marriage is never out of my head! I wi&s;h for it, &s;igh for it, pray for it, and dread it! It may well be &s;aid there is no re&s;i&s;tiong our de&s;tiny! If I could but find out the key to her ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Well! What then?&mdash;What do I want? What do I hope? To hope any thing &s;hort of the noo&s;e is mere madne&s;s. Be&s;ide, could I think of living without her?&mdash;No!&mdash;I would be eternally in her company, for &s;he is eternal novelty: &s;he is all the world in one. She is her&s;elf a million of indivi|duals; and not the &s;tale, dull repetition of the &s;ame; which is &s;o horrible to ima|gination.</P>
<P>One thought has &s;truck me.&mdash;She has
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the utmo&s;t confidence in what &s;he calls the force of truth. It cannot fail! That is her con&s;tant language. I am to be her fir&s;t convert. I have humoured this whim lately; except when my irritable fancy breaks loo&s;e, and runs riot. If &s;he have any folly, it is this &s;aid confidence: and whether it be one, or be not, is more than I have yet been able to de|termine. But &s;he has furni&s;hed me with an argument, which I might carry to I know not what extent. "You," I urge to her, <Q>you need not act with the timid and &s;u&s;picious caution of your &s;ex. You are &s;ure of your principle; and to proceed with di&s;tru&s;t and fear would prove doubt in&s;tead of cer|tainty.</Q> She boldly replies,&mdash;Yes,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
&s;he is &s;ure; and therefore &s;he &s;peaks and behaves with all that undi&s;gui&s;e and &s;in|cerity which are &s;o uncommon in the world, and which &s;ome would deem &s;o blameable.</P>
<P>She &s;ays true: &s;he ri&s;es totally &s;uperior to the petty arts and tricks of her &s;ex. I &s;eem to participate the tru&s;t which &s;he repo&s;es in her&s;elf; and the confidence which &s;he appears to place in me, when &s;he &s;o openly declares all &s;he thinks and all &s;he means, is highly plea&s;ing. But, if my views were different from what they are, I doubt whether madam Confi|dence might not be brought to lull madam Caution &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep, at &s;ome lucky moment or another, as to &s;uffer me to purloin her key, and afterward to
<PB N="15" REF="16">
rob her of all her trea&s;ure. Nor &s;hould I fail, under certain circum&s;tances, to try the experiment.</P>
<P>Neither is that intriguing &s;pirit which has &s;o long been in re&s;tle&s;s habits of continual pur&s;uit entirely idle. My fir&s;t care as u&s;ual was to &s;ecure the prime|mini&s;ter of my charmer, who&s;e name is Laura. The hu&s;&s;ey is hand&s;ome, cun|ning, and not without ambition. An occa&s;ional guinea and a few warm ki&s;&s;es, when it was certain that all was &s;afe, for caution is nece&s;&s;ary, have bound her to me. The poor fool is fond of me, and often finds &s;ome ingenious chamber|maid's excu&s;e to pay me a vi&s;it. It does not appear that I &s;hall need her agency; otherwi&s;e here &s;he is, properly prepared to be wholly at my devotion. Anna
<PB N="16" REF="17">
St. Ives affords the fancy full employ|ment; with any other woman an amour without plot and &s;tratagem, attack and defence, would be too in&s;ipid to be en|dured.</P>
<P>Not but I &s;ometimes find my con|&s;cience reproach me, for &s;uffering &s;uch active talents as mine to lie concealed and unknown; being as they are capable of acquiring renown &s;o high. When in Italy, having even there, in that land of artifice, rendered my&s;elf the &s;uperior of all competitors, I u&s;ed to glory in the havoc I &s;hould make on my return to England. But this the will of fate oppo&s;es, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent: and of what duration my honey-moon is to be is more than any pre&s;cience of mine can di&s;cover.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
Write, Fairfax, and tell me freely your opinion of all this; only remember that, if you make your calculations and conclu&s;ions from any compari&s;on with woman whom you have ever yet &s;een, they will be all error. Tell me however what you think, and all you think.</P>
<P>I forgot to &s;ay that twenty thou&s;and pounds is the &s;um to be paid me down, for conde&s;cending to accept this jewel. I am informed it is wanted, to pay off I know not what encumbrances and arrears&mdash;P&s;haw!&mdash;I care not&mdash;I have never yet troubled my&s;elf about wants, nor do I wi&s;h to begin. My father lived fa&s;t, and died &s;oon. Well! And is not that better than croaking and crawling over this dirty globe, haunted by razors, hal|ters, and barebones; &s;obbing in your
<PB N="18" REF="19">
&s;leep, groaning when awake, vegetating in &s;orrow, and dying in the &s;ulks? Let me kick my heels in mirth and &s;un&s;hine. Or, if clouds intervene, let plea&s;ure and fancy create &s;uns of their own. Tho&s;e who like them, may find gloom and November enough any day in the year. Tell me, Fairfax, may they not? Write, and tell me.</P>

<HEAD>SIR ARTHUR ST. IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>HONEST ABY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are once more arrived in Eng|land; for which I am not &s;orry. Though I cannot &s;ay that I repent my journey into France. My former &s;u&s;picions are confirmed: I had vi&s;ited the country before, but at that time my ta&s;te was not
<PB N="20" REF="21">
formed; I did not then under&s;tand lay|ing out, and improving, as I do at pre|&s;ent. I had heard that the French had begun to imitate our be&s;t gardens tole|rably well; but I have &s;een &s;ome of tho&s;e that are in mo&s;t fame, and what are they to Wenbourne-Hill?&mdash;No, no, Aby.&mdash;I am now convinced that, as they &s;ay of their Paris, there is but one Wenbourne-Hill.</P>
<P>I do not know when the family will return to the country. The young peo|ple wi&s;h to enjoy the diver&s;ions and plea|&s;ures of the town; and I rather &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall &s;tay here all the winter. Per|haps we may take a jaunt or two, be|tween this and the meeting of parliament. Not that any &s;uch plan is yet &s;ettled. And as for me, I &s;hall be down with
<PB N="21" REF="22">
you occa&s;ionally, as affairs &s;hall require. I &s;hall take great delight, in once again treading over all my grounds, and walks, and dells; and in vi&s;iting places that are never out of my mind.</P>
<P>I cannot forget the hermitage, and the grotto, and the wilderne&s;s; of which, the moment you mentioned them, I had formed &s;o charming and &s;o excellent a plan. The picture clings to me, as it were; and it grieves me to give it up. But &s;o it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>However, as I &s;ay, I &s;hall come down more than once: and, for my part, I wonder how the&s;e young unthinking people can prefer the dirty &s;treets of London, to all the delights and riches of nature, and of art; which may be &s;aid to
<PB N="22" REF="23">
be waiting for and inviting them, at Wenbourne-Hill.</P>
<P>I am very glad to find, hone&s;t Abi|melech, that money is &s;o certainly to be had. But you were always intimate with the warm old fellows, that provide them|&s;elves plentifully with what you &s;o aptly call the wherewithalls. You have fol|lowed their example, and learned to in|crea&s;e your own &s;tore. I am glad of it, and am plea&s;ed to find you do not forget your fir&s;t and be&s;t friends. I mu&s;t own, Abimelech, that you have always ap|peared to me to under&s;tand your &s;itua|tion very properly, and to pay re&s;pect where it was due. I have &s;een your proud, up&s;tart &s;tewards carry their heads as high as their ma&s;ters! Ay, and in&s;tead
<PB N="23" REF="24">
of &s;tudying their tempers and humouring them, as it was their duty, have been &s;urly, and always ready with their ifs, and ands, and objections, and advice! As if it were any concern of theirs, what a gentleman &s;hall plea&s;e to do with his money! But you, Aby, have known how to comport your&s;elf better; of which I believe you have no cau&s;e to repent.</P>
<P>As to the entail, as you &s;ay, it mu&s;t be docked. I know no remedy. And &s;ince my &s;on is &s;o po&s;itive, and deter|mined to &s;tickle for a good bargain, why we mu&s;t do the be&s;t we can.</P>
<P>I was once &s;orry at his re&s;olving never to marry; but I think that is partly over now; I care little about the matter. My daughter's &s;on will be as much my grand|child as his &s;on would have been; and, as
<PB N="24" REF="25">
for names, they may ea&s;ily be changed. I am certain, were any body to a&s;k me which is the wi&s;e&s;t, my &s;on or my daugh|ter, I &s;hould not &s;top a moment to con|&s;ider about that.</P>
<P>Ay, ay! She is my own child! Every body u&s;ed to tell me, when &s;he was a baby, how like me &s;he was!</P>
<P>She has &s;ome of her mother's features too; who, as you well know, Aby, was a very good &s;ort of an excellent kind of a lady, and very much re&s;pected: ay, very much. Indeed the greate&s;t fault of Lady St. Ives was that &s;he would not always be of my opinion. But we are none of us perfect. If it were not for that one thing, I really &s;hould think my daughter a young lady of more good &s;en&s;e, and good ta&s;te, and indeed every
<PB N="25" REF="26">
thing of that kind, than any young per|&s;on I was ever acquainted with: but &s;he too is a declared enemy to planning, and improving. It is very &s;trange; and I can only &s;ay there is no accounting for the&s;e things!</P>
<P>My &s;on however knows as little of the matter as &s;he does; nay I believe le&s;s. And, as to other kinds of knowledge, he is a child to her! It delights me to hear her talk, and debate points, and chop logic, with your Frank, who is one of her own &s;ort; and with Mr. Clifton, the young gentleman whom I intend for my &s;on in law. I gave you an account in my la&s;t, Aby, that the thing was in expectation; and it is now as good as concluded. I have written to Mrs. Clifton; the lawyer is ordered to make a
<PB N="26" REF="27">
rough &s;ketch of marriage articles, and every thing will be got ready, while my attorney is preparing the nece&s;&s;ary deeds down in the country, according to your in&s;tructions, and you are rai&s;ing the mo|ney.</P>
<P>Be &s;ure however, hone&s;t Aby, to make as good a bargain for me as you can. I know money is not to be had without paying for it; and I tru&s;t to you not to &s;uffer me to pay too dearly. Better &s;ecu|rity you know, Aby, cannot be offered; and I begin to feel, my improvements excepted, which indeed I hold to be ine&s;timable, that I am not &s;o rich as I was fifteen years ago. But, as my &s;on means never to marry, and as the fami|lies of Clifton and St. Ives are to be united in one, I have no doubt, &s;ome
<PB N="27" REF="28">
time or another before I die, of &s;eeing every thing retrieved; though I grant there are heavy mortgages, and other impediments to overcome.</P>
<P>Pray has my &s;on told you what &s;um he expects? If not, endeavour to learn, and let me know. Though on &s;econd thoughts you need not, for I hear he is to be in town next week. He mu&s;t recol|lect the e&s;tate of eight hundred a-year, of which he has lately taken &s;uch vio|lent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But he is a di&s;&s;ipated young man, and recollects nothing but his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I always &s;aid, Aby, you were a man of &s;en&s;e; and you are very right in thinking I cannot do too much for my daughter. I hope to contrive to leave Wenbourne Hill her own. It is a rich
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;pot! And, though &s;he be an econo|mi&s;t, and no friend to what &s;he thinks a wa&s;te of money in improvements, yet I am &s;ure, at my reque&s;t, &s;he will not be guilty of what I may well call &s;acrilege, and pull down my temples, and dedi|cated groves, and relics of art, and ruins; nor, as my &s;on would, de&s;troy with a Gothic hand, as the poet &s;ays, and tear away beauties, which it would rend my heart-&s;trings not to &s;uppo&s;e durable, as I may &s;ay, for ages! I would have my name, and my ta&s;te, and my improve|ments be long remembered at Wen|bourne Hill! I delight in thinking it will hereafter be &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Ay! Good old Sir Arthur did this! Yonder ter|race was of his forming! The&s;e al|coves were built by him! He rai&s;ed
<PB N="29" REF="30">
the central obeli&s;k! He planted the grand quincunx!</Q> And ah, Aby! if we could but add, <Q>He was the con|triver of yonder charming wilderne&s;s!</Q> I then &s;hould die in peace.</P>
<P>Let me beg, good abimelech, that you would write your thoughts in as plain and &s;traight forward a manner as you can; for, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have been very much puzzled with &s;ome parts of your la&s;t letter; which I cannot yet &s;ay that I under&s;tand. In &s;ome places it is very plain that you hint at Mr. Clifton, and wi&s;h me not to dally with him; and, as I know you have my intere&s;t at heart, and &s;peak in a &s;tyle at which no gentle|man can be offended, why I rather thank than blame you, for your de&s;ire to give good advice. Though I mu&s;t &s;ay, Aby,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
that I do not think I have any need of it. I am mi&s;taken if I could not ad|vi&s;e others. I wi&s;h all the world would be governed by my plans, and princi|ples. That's a favourite word with my daughter, Aby, and a very apt one.</P>
<P>I once took &s;ome delight in &s;uch things; I mean in what is called polite learning, Aby. Indeed I was remark|ably fond of Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es. But then, as I did not like to puzzle my|&s;elf with the Latin, I read Garth's, or Rowe's, or Pope's, or I don't know who&s;e tran&s;lation. And I do believe it was that, and a vi&s;it to Lord Cobham's, which fir&s;t made me &s;tudy ta&s;te and im|provement. Nothing is wanting but riches, Aby, to proceed to much greater lengths than any we have yet thought of.
<PB N="31" REF="32">
What richne&s;s of imagination is there in Ovid! What &s;tatues might we form, from the wonderful tales which he re|lates! Niobe at the head of the canal, changing into &s;tone! To be &s;ure we &s;hould want a rock there. Then on one &s;ide Narci&s;&s;us, gazing at him&s;elf in the clear pool, with poor Echo wither+ing away in the grove behind! King Cygnus, in the very act of being meta|morpho&s;ed into a &s;wan, on the other! It would be &s;o apropos, you know; a &s;wan, and a canal, and king Cygnus! And then at the further end Daphne, with her arms and legs &s;prouting into branches, and her hair all laurel leaves!</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, Aby, all the fancies which came into my head the other day, when I happened to lay my
<PB N="32" REF="33">
hand on Tooke's Pantheon, which brought all the&s;e old &s;tories fre&s;h to me|mory.</P>
<P>But, as I was &s;aying, good Aby, write your thoughts as plainly as you can; for I &s;ometimes did not know whom you were talking of, and there were one or two places which made me think you wi&s;h &s;omething &s;hould be done for your &s;on, Frank. And indeed he is a very de|&s;erving, and a very fine young fellow; and I have been thinking it would not be ami&s;s, &s;ince he has really made him|&s;elf a gentleman, if we were to purcha&s;e him an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion. What &s;ay you to it, hone&s;t Aby? He would make a fine officer! A brave bold figure of a man! And who knows but, in time, he might come to be a general; ay and
<PB N="33" REF="34">
command armies! For he fears no|thing! He has lately &s;aved us a dip|ping, nay and for aught I know a drown|ing too, and we really &s;hould do &s;ome|thing for him; for he is a great fa|vourite, and a very good young man. However, I thought it be&s;t to mention the matter fir&s;t to you, and will expect your an&s;wer.</P>

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST write, dear Loui&s;a. My heart feels as if it were e&s;tranged by &s;ilence, and thinks it has a thou&s;and things to repeat; though, when it comes to enquire what, they &s;eem as if they had all vani&s;hed. Not but I have a
<PB N="35" REF="36">
little incident to relate, which intere&s;ts us both; the Dramatis Per&s;onae being, as u&s;ual, Clifton, Frank Henley, and the friend of my Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>We ye&s;terday paid a vi&s;it to my aunt Wenbourne, at her &s;ummer villa of Richmond. But I ought to premi&s;e, that I am &s;orry to &s;ee Clifton again look|ing on Frank Henley with unea&s;ine&s;s, and a kind of &s;u&s;picion that might al|mo&s;t be called jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Having con&s;ulted Sir Arthur, I men|tioned it, as a plea&s;ant excur&s;ion, to Clifton; and added, as &s;oon as Frank Henley &s;hould come, I would de&s;ire him to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s. Sir Ar|thur was pre&s;ent; and Clifton, in a pouting kind of manner, whi&s;pered me&mdash;<Q>Can we never go any where,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
without that young fellow dogging us at the heels?</Q></P>
<P>I &s;miled it off, rapped him on the knuckles with my thimble, told him he was naughty, and &s;aid we mu&s;t not &s;uffer merit to think it&s;elf neglected. Clifton began to &s;ing Britons &s;trike home; which he &s;oon changed to Rule Britan|nia: &s;ure tokens that he was not plea&s;ed; for the&s;e are the tunes with which he al|ways &s;ings away his volatile choler. But one of the columns, on which I rai&s;e my &s;y&s;tem, is a determination to per&s;i&s;t in the right. Frank Henley was therefore invited, and accompanied us.</P>
<P>Clifton endeavoured to pout; but, as I did not in the lea&s;t change my good humour, knowing how nece&s;&s;ary it was rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h it, he
<PB N="37" REF="38">
could not long hold out, and &s;oon be|came as cheerful and as good company as u&s;ual; and his flow of &s;pirits, and whim&s;ical combinations, are very exhi|larating.</P>
<P>After dinner, my good old aunt pre|&s;ently got to wordy wars with Frank; in which, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he had little chance of victory. But &s;he called in Clifton, to be her auxiliary; and he fell into the &s;ame petti&s;h, half-haughty, half-contemning kind of manner, in which he had &s;o improperly indulged, previous to the accident of the lake, in France. I looked at him; he under|&s;tood me, and endeavoured, but rather awkwardly, to change his tone.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation continued, and he was again becoming warm; and, while
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Frank was laying down the law to my aunt, at which I could perceive his tongue tingled, I took an opportunity to warn him to beware, for that I had more than one crow to pluck with him al|ready.</P>
<P>However, as the be&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t mode was, from the temper of the parties, to put an end to the conver&s;ation, I ro&s;e, and propo&s;ed a walk, and my propo&s;al was accepted.</P>
<P>I was particularly cautious to &s;ay as lit|tle to Frank as I could, purpo&s;ely that Clifton might have no retort upon me; though a part of my plan is to accu&s;tom him to &s;ee me ju&s;t to the merits of Frank, without indulging any unworthy &s;u&s;pi|cions. But this I did not think a fit occa&s;ion for &s;uch experiments.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">
We returned to town, and I pur|po&s;ed, when Clifton &s;hould come to pay me his morning vi&s;it next day, to read him a gentle lecture. Of this he was aware; and, feeling, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;hould make a bad &s;erious de|fence, knew a comic one would better &s;erve his turn: for his fancy and humour appear to be inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he did, when he en|tered the room, was to fall down on his knees, like a child to his &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s, holding his hands pre&s;&s;ed flatly together, with a piteous face and a "Pray, pray!" I laughed, and told him he was a very bad child. His "Pray, pray!" was repeated, with another &s;trangely plea&s;ant contortion of countenance. But I &s;till an&s;wered&mdash;"No, indeed&mdash;I &s;hould not
<PB N="40" REF="41">
forgive him, till I had made him truly &s;en&s;ible of his fault." On which he ro&s;e from his knees, pulled out a paper fool's cap, which he had been carving and fa&s;hioning for him&s;elf, fixed it on his head, and placed him&s;elf, with a new kind of penitential countenance, in a corner; continuing &s;uch quaint mi|mickry, of a child in &s;orrow, that there was no re&s;i&s;ting fair and downright laughter.</P>
<P>I &s;till made two or three attempts to begin to argue; but they were ineffec|tual; they were all an&s;wered with &s;ome new antics, and I was obliged at la&s;t to &s;ay&mdash;<Q>Well, well! I find you are &s;en|&s;ible how much you de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment; and therefore I dare &s;ay you will take care not to offend in future.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
After this, he gave the whole di&s;cour&s;e a comic and a witty ca&s;t, embelli&s;hing it with all the flights of his rich and &s;trong imagination, on purpo&s;e to avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of remon&s;trance. This is a certain &s;ign that it mu&s;t be very painful to him; unle&s;s indeed we allow for the plea&s;ure which he cannot but take, in exhibiting the activity of his mind. Yet painful I am &s;ure it is. Contradiction is a thing to which he has not been accu&s;|tomed. He has no doubt led the opi|nions of his companions; partly by con|forming to and &s;trengthening their fa|vourite prejudices, though chiefly by his &s;uperior talents: and to be too often encountered, by any one who&s;e intellects are more clear and con&s;i&s;tent than his
<PB N="42" REF="43">
own, is a kind of degradation to which he &s;carcely knows how to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Frank Henley, when|ever he is pleading the cau&s;e of truth, he is inflexible. I have &s;ometimes indeed known him &s;ilent, when he was hope|le&s;s of doing good: but at others I have heard him blame him&s;elf for this, and a&s;&s;ert that we never ought to de&s;pair; for that truth, no matter how violently op|po&s;ed at the moment, would revive in the mind, and do her office, when the argument and the anger &s;hould be wholly forgotten.</P>
<P>I believe the ob&s;ervation to be ju&s;t. But he is no common thinker! No! I am almo&s;t per&s;uaded he is the fir&s;t of hu|man beings! Equal, nay I have &s;ome|times
<PB N="43" REF="44">
even thought &s;uperior, to Loui&s;a her&s;elf!</P>
<P>As you perceive, dear friend of my heart, that I know you too well to fear offending you, I am &s;ure you will do me the ju&s;tice at the &s;ame time to con|fe&s;s that I do not &s;eek to flatter.</P>
<P>Thus, dear Loui&s;a, you perceive, we do not perhaps make quite &s;o &s;wift a pro|gre&s;s as we could wi&s;h: but we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. The march of knowledge is &s;low, impeded as it is by the almo&s;t im|penetrable fore&s;ts and mora&s;&s;es of error. Ages have pa&s;&s;ed away, in labours to bring &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;imple of moral truths to light, which &s;till remain over|clouded and ob&s;cure. How far is the world, at pre&s;ent, from being convinced that it is not only po&s;&s;ible, but perfectly
<PB N="44" REF="45">
practicable, and highly natural, for men to a&s;&s;ociate with mo&s;t fraternal union, happine&s;s, peace, and virtue, were but all di&s;tinction of rank and riches wholly aboli&s;hed; were all the fal&s;e wants of luxury, which are the nece&s;&s;ary offspring of individual property, cut off; were all equally obliged to labour for the wants of nature, and for nothing more; and were they all afterward to unite, and to employ the remainder of their time, which would then be ample, in the pro|motion of art and &s;cience, and in the &s;earch of wi&s;dom and truth!</P>
<P>The few arts that would then remain would be grand; not frivolous, not the efforts of cunning, not the pro&s;titution of genius in di&s;tre&s;s, to flatter the vanity of in&s;olent wealth and power, or the de|praved
<PB N="45" REF="46">
ta&s;te of an ill-judging multitude; but energies of mind, uniting all the charms of fancy with all the &s;evere beau|ties of con&s;i&s;tent truth.</P>
<P>Is it not lamentable to be obliged to doubt whether there be a hundred peo|ple in all England, who, were they to read &s;uch a letter as this, would not im|mediately laugh, at the ab&s;urd reveries of the writer?&mdash;But let them look round, and deny, if they can, that the pre&s;ent wretched &s;y&s;tem, of each providing for him&s;elf in&s;tead of the whole for the whole, does not in&s;pire &s;u&s;picion, fear, di&s;putes, quarrels, mutual contempt, and hatred. In&s;tead of nations, or rather of the whole world, uniting to produce one great effect, the perfection and good of all, each family is it&s;elf a &s;tate; bound to

the re&s;t by intere&s;t and cunning, but &s;e|parated by the very &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and a thou&s;and others; living together un|der a kind of truce, but continually ready to break out into open war; con|tinually jealous of each other; continu|ally on the defen&s;ive, becau&s;e continu|ally dreading an attack; ever ready to u&s;urp on the rights of others, and perpe|tually entangled in the mo&s;t wretched contentions, concerning what all would neglect, if not de&s;pi&s;e, did not the errors of this &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem give value to what is in it&s;elf worthle&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, well!&mdash;Another century, and then&mdash;!</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us live in hope; and, like our worthy hero, Frank, not be &s;ilent when truth requires us to &s;peak.

<HEAD>LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Ro&s;e-Bank.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN odd circum&s;tance, my dear Anna, has happened here, of which I think it nece&s;&s;ary to inform you immediately.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Aby has again been with us. He came and enquired for my mamma. Di&s;appointment, chagrin, and ill-humour were broadly legible on his countenance.
<PB N="50" REF="51">
He talked in his odd dialect; which I cannot remember accurately enough to repeat; &s;aid he had ju&s;t received a letter from Sir Arthur, from which he under|&s;tood &s;omething that to him appeared to be matter of great &s;urpri&s;e; which was that Sir Arthur intended to be&s;tow your hand on my brother; and, in a half &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive half authoritative way, wanted to know whether it were true; and whe|ther my mamma knew any thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>She acknowledged that &s;uch were the intentions of the two families: and he an|&s;wered that, for his part, he thought they might as well think no more of the matter; muttering the words <HI>wherewithal,</HI> and <HI>coal.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Clifton de&s;ired him to be ex|plicit;
<PB N="51" REF="52">
but he continued in half &s;en|tences, repeating that the ready was not &s;o ea&s;y to be had, and rhino was a &s;carce commodity. Neither could he tell what might happen. There were foreclo&s;ures, and docking of entails, and many things to be &s;ettled; and ca&s;h mu&s;t come from where it could be got; but not from him, he believed.</P>
<P>My mamma, mild as &s;he is, was obliged to check his growling inclination to be in&s;olent; and then he had his whole bead-roll of fine words, with which he has &s;o often tickled the ear of Sir Arthur, at his tongue's end; and ran them off with his u&s;ual gra|cious, and very humble obedient volu|bility.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">
Had I not received your la&s;t, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter LVIII: whence we may conclude that the letter immediately preceding this was not come to hand.</NOTE> his di&s;|cour&s;e would have been more enigmatical to me: but, as it was, I under&s;tood him tolerably well. The bitterne&s;s of gall is at his heart. The greatne&s;s of his vi&s;ible di&s;appointment &s;hews how high his hopes had been rai&s;ed; and I &s;u&s;pect he is de|termined they &s;hall not be very ea&s;ily pulled down. For, after having acted all his abject humility, he could not for|bear again to murmur over his threats, as he was leaving the room; and there was an air of &s;elf-&s;ufficient confidence &s;o apparent in his face that, I am per&s;uaded, the ob&s;tacles he has the power to rai&s;e are much greater than you, my dear friend, have ever &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">
I cannot de&s;cribe to you, my be&s;t Anna, how deeply my mind is agitated, at times, concerning this marriage. I cen|&s;ure my&s;elf very &s;everely, for &s;eeming to indulge improper fears, one minute; and perhaps, the next, am more angry with my&s;elf for not di&s;intere&s;tedly pleading the cau&s;e of Frank Henley. If there could be a miracle in nature, I &s;hould think his being the &s;on of <HI>hone&s;t Aby</HI> one. What can I &s;ay? My doubts are too mighty for me! I know not how, or what, to advi&s;e. The rea&s;ons you have urged are indeed weighty: yet they have never made an impre&s;&s;ion &s;o deep upon my mind, as not to take flight, and leave their opponent arguments in &s;ome &s;ort the victors.</P>
<P>Nor can I be more angry with my&s;elf,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
on any occa&s;ion, than I am at this mo|ment. I di&s;tre&s;s and trouble you with my fears, when I ought to keep them to my&s;elf; unle&s;s I could determine whe|ther they were or were not well founded. They are even increa&s;ed by the recol|lection that, in all probability, Clifton could now much le&s;s bear di&s;appointment than the &s;trong-minded and generous Frank.</P>
<P>Then, my Anna! Should ill happen to her, from an undertaking the motive of which is &s;o worthy, &s;o dignified, what &s;hould I &s;ay? Should misfortune come, how could I excu&s;e my&s;elf, for having neglected to di&s;&s;uade, and to urge &s;uch rea&s;ons as have appeared to me the &s;tronge&s;t? What could I &s;ay, but re|Peat the diffidence of my mind, the want
<PB N="55" REF="56">
of full and &s;atisfactory conviction, and the fear of mi&s;take?</P>
<P>The only buckler, with which I op|po&s;e the&s;e in&s;urrections of rea&s;on, is the omnipotence of truth, and Anna St. Ives! And, when I recollect this, my terrors are hu&s;hed, and I think her &s;ure of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The very affirmative tokens which Aby di&s;played of his own con&s;equence, convince me however that there will be delay. How Clifton will &s;ubmit to it is to be &s;een. His letter to my mamma is all impatience, and expectation. But I have talked with her, and &s;he appears to be determined that nothing can be done, till Sir Arthur is ready to pay the &s;um he propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>My Anna will not be very ready to
<PB N="56" REF="57">
attribute this to avarice; for no one can think more highly of her than Mrs. Clifton does. But my father, at his death, left the family in ab&s;olute di&s;tre&s;s, from which &s;he has retrieved it, by her economy and good &s;en&s;e: retrieved it, that is, in part; for there are &s;till many heavy debts to pay, and mortgages to be cleared. Her plans have been &s;e|vere; and of long continuance; deeply thought on, and per&s;everingly executed. To convince her that any part of them ought to be relinqui&s;hed &s;carcely appears po&s;&s;ible. Nor am I &s;ure that, obliged as we are to conform to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;|tem of things, they are not all ju&s;t. Be|&s;ide which &s;he is not in a &s;tate of health to &s;upport the fatigue of argument, or the pain of contradiction.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
She likewi&s;e con&s;iders Sir Arthur as a weak old gentleman; who, if this op|portunity were abandoned, would perhaps never have the &s;pirit or the power, here|after, to do his daughter ju&s;tice: and &s;he thinks that, for your &s;ake, &s;he ought not in the lea&s;t to relax. Should you, my dear Anna, rea&s;on differently, I am &s;till certain that you will rea&s;on charitably.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my brother, it may perhaps be fortunate, &s;hould the &s;u&s;|pen&s;e afford you time for further trials; and we may have cau&s;e to rejoice at the accident, which had checked the preci|pitate impatience of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though I expect a letter from you by tomorrow's po&s;t, I think this of too much con&s;equence to &s;uffer any delay:
<PB N="58" REF="59">
I &s;hall therefore &s;eal it, and &s;end it off immediately.</P>

<SALUTE>Mo&s;t onnurable Sir, my ever onnurd Ma&s;ter,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OLIVER, it is not half an hour &s;ince I ended writing one of the mo&s;t unduti|ful and bitter Philippics, that ever was addre&s;&s;ed by a &s;on to his father. I &s;ay undutiful, becau&s;e this wi&s;e world has decreed that to abhor, reprove, and avoid
<PB N="75" REF="76">
vice in a father, in&s;tead of being the per|formance of a duty, is offen&s;ive to all moral feeling.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received a letter from him, chiding and blaming me, with his u&s;ual acrimony, for a &s;uppo&s;ed want of cun|ning; and for not aiding him in what I perceive now to be the de&s;ign he has mo&s;t at heart; which is my marriage with the divine Anna. He has almo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted me with my&s;elf, for having, though in|effectually, endeavoured to aid him &s;o well. Nay I have been tempted to &s;hew his letter to Sir Arthur. But, on recol|lection, I have thrown the Philippic I mentioned into the fire; and have de|termined on &s;ilence: for I perceive harm that may re&s;ult from a contrary con|duct, but no good. To &s;werve, to the
<PB N="76" REF="77">
right or the left, from the direct path of principle and truth, becau&s;e of the &s;elfi&s;h, narrow, and unwi&s;e views of others, is to be weak and culpable.</P>
<P>What, indeed, has relation&s;hip to do with truth? No human ties can bind us to error: and, while we rigorou&s;ly act according to the rules of truth, as far as we know them, the comments, mi&s;takes, di&s;approbation, and even re&s;entment, of relation, friend, or father, ought to be di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, however, I have &s;till the folly to feel additional grief that errors of &s;o mean, &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, &s;o di&s;hone&s;t a na|ture &s;hould have taken &s;uch firm po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the mind of my father: and I am afraid I could &s;upport them better in the per&s;on of another.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
Having determined not to write to him, I have written to thee, to give vent and relief to the&s;e feelings. Of cour&s;e thou wilt tell me if thou &s;ee&s;t any rea|&s;on, which I have not di&s;covered, why I ought to communicate the contents of his letter to Sir Arthur; whom he vaunts of having in his power, and whom he is determined not to &s;upply with money, for the projected marriage with Clifton. My conviction is that to &s;hew this letter would but increa&s;e their mutual anger, and render compliance on my father's part, who&s;e temper I know, &s;till le&s;s pro|bable than it is; if le&s;s it can be.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE, at pre&s;ent, to my dear Loui&s;a, that by writing I may divert the perturbation of my mind. But I mu&s;t begin calmly; for I have &s;o much to &s;ay, that I &s;carcely know what to &s;ay fir&s;t. Our mutual conjec|tures, concerning hone&s;t Aby, are in
<PB N="79" REF="80">
part verified. I conclude thus, not from having &s;een any more of his letters, but from knowing more have been re|ceived; which, in&s;tead of having been &s;hewn me, have, if I do not mi&s;take, thrown Sir Arthur into &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections he ever experienced. I never knew him &s;o grave, thoughtful, and pen&s;ive, as he has been for &s;ome days&mdash;</P>
<P>My brother too!&mdash;But more of him by and by.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving the efforts of reflection, and de&s;irous of aiding, alleviating, or increa&s;ing them, as &s;hould be mo&s;t pru|dent, I took an opportunity, after break|fa&s;t, when Sir Arthur and I were alone, of &s;peaking to him; and we had the fol|lowing dialogue.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">
I think, &s;ir, you &s;eem more thoughtful lately than u&s;ual. I am afraid there is &s;omething di&s;turbs you. Can I&mdash;?</P>
<P>No, no&mdash;Nothing&mdash;Not much. Worldly matters, which you do not un|der&s;tand.</P>
<P>I am far from wi&s;hing, &s;ir, to intrude into your private concerns; except they were &s;uch as might relate to me, and&mdash;</P>
<P>Mere money matters, child; of which you have no knowledge&mdash;[We pau&s;ed; Sir Arthur &s;eeming as if his mind la|boured with a &s;ubject which he knew not how to begin]&mdash;Where is Mr. Henley?</P>
<P>Retired to his apartment, &s;ir. This is his time of day for &s;tudy.</P>
<P>He is a very learned young man.</P>
<P>Not &s;o learned I believe, &s;ir, as wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Are not they the &s;ame thing?</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82">
I think not, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Well then, a very wi&s;e young man&mdash;You think him &s;o; do you not, Anna?</P>
<P>I do, &s;ir.</P>
<P>You have a very high opinion of him?</P>
<P>I have, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Perhaps a higher than of any other young gentleman, with whom you are acquainted.</P>
<P>I am indeed afraid, &s;ir, I have never &s;een his equal.</P>
<P>Humph!&mdash;You&mdash;You are not &s;paring of your prai&s;e.</P>
<P>You a&s;ked me a que&s;tion, &s;ir, and would not have me guilty of equivoca|tion, or fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>No, child: I am plea&s;ed with your &s;incerity; and I hope and expect you
<PB N="82" REF="83">
will be equally &s;incere in every thing you &s;ay.</P>
<P>Of that, &s;ir, you may be a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>What are your rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o exceedingly well of Mr. Henley?</P>
<P>My rea&s;ons, &s;ir!</P>
<P>Yes; your rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>I own I am a little &s;urpri&s;ed at this que&s;tion from you, &s;ir; who have been a witne&s;s to &s;o many of his virtues, and their effects.</P>
<P>[I then briefly recapitulated the pro|gre&s;s of Frank from a child in virtue, in|&s;i&s;ting on the numerous proofs of which we &s;o lately had been witne&s;&s;es. I re|counted the hi&s;tories of the highway|man, and of Peggy and her hu&s;band; the adventure of the lake; and the pro|tection
<PB N="83" REF="84">
we found from his &s;kill, &s;trength, and courage at Deal; not forgetting the attendant incidents of each, nor neglect|ing to give &s;uch brief but &s;trong touches as feeling dictated.]</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, he is a very extraordinary young man!</P>
<P>Yet we can know but a part of the good effected by a mind &s;o active, and &s;o virtuous. Though I perhaps know more than you, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Ay!&mdash;What? Let me hear.</P>
<P>You think me partial already, &s;ir.</P>
<P>No, no. Let me hear.</P>
<P>The very night we arrived at Paris, he prevented Mr. Clifton and the Count de Beaunoir from fighting a duel.</P>
<P>Indeed!</P>
<P>Yet never mentioned it; nor perhaps
<PB N="84" REF="85">
ever would, had not we afterward met with the Count at the Chateau de Ville|brun.</P>
<P>That was very odd!</P>
<P>Nay more, &s;ir, but a day or two be|fore that he &s;aved the life of Mr. Clifton, he had &s;ubmitted to the in&s;ult of a blow from him, rather than fight a duel.</P>
<P>A blow&mdash;?</P>
<P>He does not want courage, &s;ir, you are convinced.</P>
<P>No, no&mdash;It is what he calls one of his principles not to fight duels&mdash;He is a very extraordinary young man!&mdash;And not I think much like his father.</P>
<P>As oppo&s;ite, &s;ir, as day and night, grace and deformity, virtue and vice.</P>
<P>You think but indifferently of Abi|melech.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
I think very ill of him, &s;ir. I think him &s;elfi&s;h, cunning, covetous, and di&s;|hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Di&s;hone&s;t?</P>
<P>In the eye of equity, though not per|haps of the law.</P>
<P>Why did not you tell me your opi|nion &s;ooner?</P>
<P>I did, &s;ir.</P>
<P>I do not remember it.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir: it made no impre&s;&s;ion, be|cau&s;e you did not think it true.</P>
<P>May be &s;o&mdash;And you do not find any of the&s;e bad qualities in the &s;on?</P>
<P>Bad!&mdash;If all the highe&s;t gifts of in|tellect; if memory, per&s;picuity, percep|tion, and genius; added to all the vir|tues, wi&s;dom, benevolence, philan|thropy, and &s;elf-denial; if to be the ac|tive
<PB N="86" REF="87">
friend of man and the declared ene|my of error, and of that alone; if the&s;e can entitle him to e&s;teem, admiration, reverence and prai&s;e, why then e&s;teem, admiration, reverence and prai&s;e are ju&s;tly his due.</P>
<P>You are warm in your encomiums.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir, I think I am cold.</P>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e my encomiums are &s;o very much beneath his de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Anna&mdash;[Sir Arthur a&s;&s;umed a very &s;erious tone, and look.]</P>
<P>Proceed, &s;ir&mdash;Do not be afraid of que&s;tioning me. You &s;hall find, my dear father, a child that will an&s;wer truly, affectionately, and I hope duti|fully.</P>
<P>[I ki&s;&s;ed his hand, pre&s;&s;ed it, and wet
<PB N="87" REF="88">
it with an unwilling tear. The impa&s;|&s;ioned heart, Loui&s;a, will &s;ometimes re|bel again&s;t the cold apathy of rea&s;on; but &s;uch revolt is but of &s;hort dura|tion.]</P>
<P>Are you aware, Anna, of the &s;tate of your own affections?</P>
<P>I think &s;o, &s;ir.</P>
<P>You think?</P>
<P>Well then, I am certain.</P>
<P>You &s;ay Mr. Henley has no equal?</P>
<P>In my opinion, none, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Look you there!</P>
<P>But do you think, &s;ir, I will not emu|late the virtues I admire: or that, be|cau&s;e I have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his worth, I will tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t my duties to the world, my &s;ex, my family and my fa|ther?</P>

Anna!&mdash;Child!&mdash;[The tears &s;tood in Sir Arthur's eyes. He &s;tretched out both hands, and I flew to his arms.&mdash;After a &s;hort interval of &s;ilence, Sir Ar|thur proceeded.] Tell me, Anna: What are your thoughts of Mr. Clifton?</P>
<P>I think him, &s;ir, a very extraordina|rily gifted gentleman.</P>
<P>But not a Mr. Henley?</P>
<P>Not at pre&s;ent, &s;ir. Time I hope will make him one.</P>
<P>No, child, never.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, &s;ir?</P>
<P>I cannot tell why, but I am &s;ure it ne|ver will. They are two very different men.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton, &s;ir, has uncommon powers of mind.</P>
<P>May be &s;o; I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o; I only &s;ay

they are very different men. Their tem|pers are different, their opinions, their manners, every thing.</P>
<P>I do not imagine, &s;ir, they will ever exactly re&s;emble each other; but I think my&s;elf &s;ure they will continually ap|proach.</P>
<P>Indeed!</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Sir Arthur &s;aw my agitation; and, had I been de&s;irous, it would have been difficult to have concealed the letter, or its contents. I &s;hewed it him, and his perplexity and pain I believe exceeded mine. It was impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;aid, for him immediately to pay the money: it would greatly di&s;tre&s;s him at any time. It like|wi&s;e &s;hewed the deplorable &s;tate of my brother's affairs. The Edgemoor e&s;tate, every thing gone!</P>
<P>Sir Arthur knew not how to act. I was in a tremor, and could not per&s;uade my&s;elf there was any way &s;o &s;afe as that of con&s;ulting Frank Henley. This I
<PB N="92" REF="93">
propo&s;ed; Sir Arthur in&s;tantly acqui|e&s;ced, and he was &s;ent for down. After reading the letter, the only expedient, he &s;aid, which he could think of, was to vi&s;it my brother; either accompanied by or under the &s;anction of Sir Arthur. My father ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go him&s;elf; but he gave Frank full powers to act for him, and as he &s;hould think mo&s;t pru|dent. Before he went, he endeavoured to calm our fears; &s;aying he thought it impo&s;&s;ible, if &s;uch a ra&s;cal as this gam|bler were properly dealt with, but that he mu&s;t be glad to renounce his claim.</P>
<P>Frank is now ab&s;ent on this de&s;perate bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;ent, by my officiou&s;ne&s;s, to encounter a practi&s;ed ruffian!</P>
<P>What could I do? A brother threat|ening

his own life! Yet what is the life of &s;uch a brother, to that of Frank Hen|ley?</P>
<P>I hope he is not in danger! I think I was obliged to do as I have done; though indeed I am very ill &s;atisfied with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The chief purpo&s;e of my writing this long dialogue, which I had with Sir Ar|thur, was to ward off fears: for &s;urely it is but a folly to anticipate misfortune.

He was earne&s;t with me to accompany him, in the evening, to &s;ee Garrick in Richard III. but could not prevail. He taxed me with ab&s;ence of mind, and was kindly earne&s;t to know why I was &s;o &s;erious. I told him at la&s;t it was a family concern; and this did but increa&s;e his eagerne&s;s to know of what nature. I was obliged to own he was too impetuous to be tru&s;ted at &s;uch a cri|tical minute. Frank Henley I hoped would effect every thing that could be done.</P>
<P>He repeated, with great chagrin, <Q>Frank Henley!&mdash;He was &s;orry not to be thought as worthy of a tru&s;t of danger, and as zealous for the honour
<PB N="95" REF="96">
of the family, as even the favourite Frank Henley.</Q></P>
<P>I replied my mind was not enough at ea&s;e, to give a proper an&s;wer to &s;uch a remark; which however was far from a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>He felt the rebuke, and apologized; with prai&s;es of Frank Henley's pru|dence, and accu&s;ations of his own intem|perate ha&s;te. <Q>But wi&s;e people knew how to be cool. Prudence and wi&s;|dom were cold blooded qualities. Good or harm, of any moment, if done by him, mu&s;t be done in a kind of pa&s;|&s;ion. It was his temper, his nature, which he tried in vain to correct. Neither was he quite certain that &s;uch a temper was not the be&s;t: at lea&s;t it was the mo&s;t open and hone&s;t.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">
I told him he was mi&s;taken in mo&s;t of the&s;e fancies: but he &s;eemed not to hear me, and went on&mdash;</P>
<Q>He could not but own, he was piqued, and almo&s;t grieved, to find he mu&s;t de&s;pair of meriting the prefer|ence; and that he was de&s;tined to find a rival, where rival&s;hip ought perhaps lea&s;t to be expected.</Q>
<P>My temper of mind did not permit me to argue with him; I could much rather have indulged the woman, and bur&s;t into tears; but I &s;ubdued my feel|ings, and could think of no better mode of reproving him than to retire. I ac|cordingly withdrew, without an&s;wering&punc; and left him making ineffectual &s;trug|gles with his pride, his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of error, and his de&s;ire of being
<PB N="97" REF="98">
heard, and reconciled to him&s;elf, and me.</P>
<P>He told me, ye&s;terday, he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at not receiving an an&s;wer from Mrs. Clifton, and at the &s;ilence of Sir Arthur. I made no reply, becau&s;e I had not con&s;idered how I could addre&s;s my|&s;elf to him with the be&s;t effect. But I mean, when he mentions it again, to in|form him of the probability of delay. I, like you, my friend, think delay rather a fortunate incident than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But why, Loui&s;a, &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify the conduct of Mrs. Clifton to me? I am well acquaint|ed with her virtues, and the purity of her intentions. Whether I &s;hould act with exactly the &s;ame caution, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, is more than I can &s;ay:
<PB N="98" REF="99">
but neither can I &s;ay that my prudence, and fore&s;ight, would equal hers.&mdash;I think I hear Frank Henley. I am all impatience and alarm. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FRANK has this moment left me. He is &s;till in pur&s;uit of this bu&s;ine&s;s, which is by no means brought to a con|clu&s;ion. He has been with my brother, and has met the gambler; with whom two very characteri&s;tic dialogues have pa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
which Frank has repeated with con&s;ider|able humour. My brother was only pre&s;ent at and bore his part in the &s;econd. The man is a perfect ma&s;ter of his vile trade; a practi&s;ed duelli&s;t; as expert, Frank &s;ays, in killing of men as in cog|ging of dice. A Hibernian bravo; de|termined to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t de&s;perate means to effect his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Energy in vice or virtue, Frank re|marks, is the characteri&s;tic of the Iri&s;h. It is a noble quality, of which no nation perhaps has more, if any &s;o much; but it is frequently abu&s;ed by them, and made productive of the mo&s;t hateful ef|fects.</P>
<P>Frank was with my brother in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, when the man came and was &s;hewn into an anti-chamber by the
<PB N="101" REF="102">
&s;ervant. Edward was &s;ufficiently un|willing to &s;ee him, and readily agreed to the propo&s;al Frank made, of fir&s;t con|ver&s;ing with him, as my brother's friend.</P>
<P>Frank accordingly went to him, and &s;ays he was &s;truck at the &s;ight of the man, being much deceived if he be not an old acquaintance. I was and &s;till am &s;ur|pri&s;ed at what Frank told me; but he begged I would &s;u&s;pend my curio&s;ity, till he him&s;elf &s;hould be better &s;atisfied; and proceeded with his dialogue.</P>
<P>Your name I believe, &s;ir, is Mr. Mac Fane.</P>
<P>At your &s;arvice, &s;ir.</P>
<P>I am the friend of Captain St. Ives.</P>
<P>Then to be &s;ure, &s;ir, you are a gintle|man, and a man of honour. I am a
<PB N="102" REF="103">
gintleman and a man of honour my|&s;ilf.</P>
<P>Do you &s;ay that from your con&s;cience, &s;ir?</P>
<P>From my con&s;cience? Ay, &s;ir! Why not? When all my debts due are duly and truly paid, why I &s;hall have ten thou&s;and pounds in my pocket.</P>
<P>There are people, &s;ir, heretical enough to &s;uppo&s;e that even ten thou&s;and pounds are no ab&s;olute proof of honour.</P>
<P>No, indeed!&mdash;Why then, for tho&s;e very &s;crupulous people, I have an ex|cellent pair of proof pi&s;tols, which I be|lieve are ab&s;olute enough. Beca&s;e I would take the odds that they would hit a bird's eye flying.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
Tho&s;e arguments I own are difficult to with&s;tand.</P>
<P>Stand!&mdash;Faith, and if any man &s;hall think proper to &s;tand, I will fetch him down.&mdash;[Remember, Loui&s;a, I am imi|tating this man's language, as delivered by Frank; though I believe my me|mory is tolerably correct.] But I &s;hould be proud to &s;peak a word with your friend; becau&s;e that will be more to the point.</P>
<P>He reque&s;ted me to inform you, &s;ir, he &s;hould be glad if you would delay your vi&s;it an hour or two; and I think it will be the &s;afe&s;t; for you I per|ceive, &s;ir, are rather warm; and his temper, as you may imagine, cannot be &s;o cool, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>His temper!&mdash;Faith, &s;ir, and the de|vil
<PB N="104" REF="105">
a care care I about his temper! And as for warm and cool, I can be either, or neither, or both. I have won the money, and the Captain mu&s;t pay it; or el&s;e d'ye &s;ee, &s;ir&mdash;!</P>
<P>You'll hit the bird's eye flying?</P>
<P>Ay; flying, or lying, or any way!&mdash;However, I will take a turn and come back by and by. I have two or three calls to make on &s;ome peers of my ac|quaintance. I am a man of nice ho|nour, &s;ir.</P>
<P>And you imagine, nice though it is, that your honour is &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, &s;ir, I imagine no &s;uch thing. Beca&s;e as why, I think it would not be very &s;afe. I tell you very &s;eri|ou&s;ly, &s;ir, that I have a &s;ure &s;acrit to cure any impartinent &s;u&s;picions of my honour;
<PB N="105" REF="106">
as I beg you would inform your friend, Captain St. Ives; who, being a man of honour him&s;ilf, knows what belongs to the bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e, &s;ir, are tender points, with every gintleman. And &s;o, &s;ir, I wi&s;h you a good morning for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Frank &s;ays he was de&s;irous of conver&s;|ing with the man, that he might di&s;co|ver his character, previous to his con|certing any plan of action.</P>
<P>After he was gone, he endeavoured to lead my brother into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;tate of his affairs. But Edward avoided all detail; &s;atisfying him&s;elf with affirm|ing he was a ruined man, and unable to pay the &s;um. He had no objection to meet the fellow in the field; though cer|tainly the chances were a hundred to
<PB N="106" REF="107">
one in his disfavour. He might as well die that way as any other. With re&s;pect to victory, of that there were but little hopes, with &s;o expert a ruffian, who had practi&s;ed pi&s;tol &s;hooting till he was &s;ure of his mark, which my brother had wholly neglected.</P>
<P>Frank then enquired at what hou&s;e the money had been lo&s;t; and found it had been at one of the common receptacles for gamblers of the fecond order. No per&s;on was pre&s;ent but the groom por|ter, whom Frank immediately deter|mined to &s;ee, and went thither for that purpo&s;e. But, on enquiry at the hou&s;e, he found the man had ab&s;conded.</P>
<P>He returned, and had &s;ome difficulty to convince my brother that his honour would not &s;uffer by delay; for it was
<PB N="107" REF="108">
plain that Mr. Mac Fane was re&s;olved on immediately pu&s;hing the matter to an extreme. However, on communi|cating his own conjectures concerning this man of nice honour, Edward con|&s;ented to permit Frank to act in his be|half. Frank ob&s;erves that our men of fa&s;hion &s;eem agreed to overlook a por|tion of in&s;olence from the&s;e gamblers, under the affectation of de&s;pi&s;ing them, which the tame&s;t of the fine gentlemen among them would &s;carcely brook from each other.</P>
<P>In about two hours, Mr. Mac Fane returned; and, being introduced to my brother and Frank, another conver&s;ation very &s;imilar to the former en&s;ued. The man began.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, gintlemen. I told you
<PB N="108" REF="109">
la&s;t night, Captain, that I would give you a call this morning: and as it is an affair in which your honour is concerned, why I was determined to be very punc|tual. Beca&s;e why, you know, I am ex|tremely nice and punctual my&s;ilf, upon points of honour.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to be obliged to tell you, &s;ir, that Captain St. Ives neither knows nor owns any &s;uch thing; and that I have good rea&s;on to believe the very re|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir!&mdash;You&mdash;! [Frank &s;ays the man put on the true look of a de&s;perado, re&s;olved on mi&s;chief if oppo&s;ed: but that, after pau&s;ing a moment, he began, with a kind of humorous anger, to rub the &s;ide of his face, as if it were be|numbed] Faith, on recollection, I be|lieve
<PB N="109" REF="110">
I got a bit of a cold la&s;t night, which makes me rather dull of hearing.</P>
<P>Sir, I repeat&mdash;</P>
<P>Repate!&mdash;Boo!&mdash;There is no occa|&s;ion to repate, at all at all. I remember very well that my friend, Captain St. Ives, owes me three thou&s;and guineas; and, it being a dibt of honour, why, to be &s;ure he will pay it, without any re|pating about the matter.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid my brother, give me leave to tell you&mdash;</P>
<P>That you will pay me. You need not tell me that.</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;!</P>
<P>There never yet was man that refu&s;ed to pay me, but oh! The almighty thun|der! I gave him a re&s;ate in full for the dibt. I made him repint after his death the day that ever he was born.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">
There's the door, &s;ir, &s;aid Frank.</P>
<P>Faith and I know there's the door, &s;ir; but where's the money. Captain?&mdash;That is, I don't mane the ready ca&s;h: that is not to be expected, from a gentle|man&mdash;A bond in the&s;e ca&s;es you know, Captain, is cu&s;tomary.</P>
<P>Sir, there's the door.</P>
<P>I find that your friend, here, is di&s;|po&s;ed to be a little upon the Captain Copperthorne this morning; and &s;o I &s;hall leave you for the pre&s;ent to con&s;i|der the matter. I have no doubt but I &s;hall hear from you, Captain, in the cour&s;e of the four and twenty hours. It is now full three weeks &s;ince I heard the whiz of a bullet; and I would advi&s;e you, as a friend, not to wa&s;te any of your powder and ball upon the pri&s;ent
<PB N="111" REF="112">
occa&s;ion. It would only be a buz and blow by bu&s;ine&s;s, Captain: for, by the holy limb of Luke, I never yet &s;aw lead that dur&s;t look me in the face.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be glad to be alone, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Faith, &s;ir, you may be as bluff as you plea&s;e; but, when the Captain is a little cool, I &s;hall expict to receive a bit of a me&s;&s;age from him; or may I never look on the bald pate of the ble&s;&s;ed Peter but he &s;hall receive a bit of a me&s;&s;age from me. And &s;o once more, gintle|men, good morning.</P>
<P>Frank did not lo&s;e a moment after he was gone, but ha&s;tened home; fir&s;t to inform us of his proceedings, thus far; and next to make the re&s;earches on which he is now ab&s;ent. Here, therefore, my dear Loui&s;a, I mu&s;t pau&s;e; and once

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> I have rea&s;on to believe that Clifton is more &s;eriou&s;ly offended than I ever knew him before. When I refu&s;ed going to the play with him, he per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying I might change my mind be|fore night, and that he would come again in that hope. His manner of parting with me, after being told Frank was en|tru&s;ted with a bu&s;ine&s;s which we had not dared confide to him, was, as I have de&s;cribed, unu&s;ual, and accompanied with more coldne&s;s and re&s;erve than ei|ther of us had ever before a&s;&s;umed. It is now eight o'clock, and I have not &s;een him &s;ince. If he have re&s;olution enough

<P>FRANK is returned; and, as u&s;ual, crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I had been puzzling my&s;elf to no purpo&s;e, concerning Mr. Mac Fane be|ing one of our old acquaintance. It ap|pears he was the accomplice of the high|wayman, Webb, the brother of Peggy,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
who was &s;hot by Frank at Turnham Green. He forebore to tell me, in part becau&s;e he had not time to connect and relate the grounds of his &s;u&s;picion; though his chief rea&s;on was le&s;t a whi&s;|per, heard by Laura or any other, &s;hould have betrayed and overturned his whole &s;cheme.</P>
<P>He went immediately to que&s;tion Mrs. Clarke, concerning her nephew. She knew not what was become of him; for, after having determined to go abroad, he changed his mind; and, be|ing reproved and di&s;countenanced by her, he had forborne his vi&s;its. She had even refu&s;ed to hear his name mentioned. But &s;he believed her niece, Peggy, had &s;ome knowledge of him; though &s;he was not certain.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
Frank thought proper to confide in Mrs. Clarke, and they immediately went in que&s;t of the niece. From her they learned that he had been promoted to the office of groom-porter at a gambling hou&s;e: and in fact he proved to be the very man who had been pre&s;ent at the tran&s;action between Edward and Mr. Mac Fane.</P>
<P>Peggy was next que&s;tioned concern|ing his pre&s;ent hiding-place. She was confu&s;ed; &s;he &s;tammered, and trembled. Was not her brother in danger? Could &s;he be &s;ure no harm would come to him?&mdash;At la&s;t however the mild and humane rea&s;oning of Frank, and the au|thority of Mrs. Clarke &s;ubdued, her ter|rors&mdash;He was in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the moment he knew it was
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Captain St. Ives, my brother, whom Mr. Mac Fane had been plundering, he refu&s;ed to appear, or have any further concern in the affair: and being vio|lently threatened by the gambler, who wanted to force him to come forward as his witne&s;s, he concealed him&s;elf for fear; not knowing to what exce&s;s &s;o de|&s;perate a man might be carried by his pa&s;&s;ions. He and Peggy had ju&s;t been debating on the propriety of appearing to bear te&s;timony in my brother's be|half; but were too much alarmed to de|cide.</P>
<P>Frank lo&s;t no time. He took the man with him in the carriage, and ha&s;tened to my brother's apartments; where he left him, and immediately drove away to Bow-&s;treet, to procure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="118" REF="119">
the police. Previous to this, Mr. Mac Fane, having received &s;ome intimation that there was danger, had written to my brother. The following is a copy of his letter; and no bad &s;pecimen of the man.</P>

<P>I FIND you think that there is a bit of a blunder in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that you doubt the doctors.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>PHELIM MAC FANE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Is it not a pity, Loui&s;a, that &s;o much courage and ability &s;hould be perverted to &s;uch vile ends? The man, by means of the wealth he had &s;o rapidly collected in this manner, had &s;ecured more than one &s;py among the Bow-&s;treet runners. This we learned from Peggy's brother; and it is confirmed by the event; for he has for&s;aken all his former haunts, and it is conjectured is either gone off for the continent, or, which is more probable, is lying concealed till he can di&s;cover how far he is in danger. He was con|&s;tantly provided with di&s;gui&s;es, has been
<PB N="120" REF="121">
to &s;ea, and is intimately acquainted with the manners of the vulgar; &s;o that, were any &s;trict &s;earch made, he would not ea|&s;ily be caught. But he need not fear; his &s;uppo&s;ed enemy takes no delight in blood; and this he will probably &s;oon Iearn, and &s;oon again be upon the town.</P>
<P>You wonder, no doubt, how Frank &s;hould recogni&s;e a man who, attempting to rob us on a dark night, had &s;tationed him&s;elf at the head of the carriage. Had he &s;een no more of him, he would have been in little danger of detection. But, on one of the vi&s;its which Frank made to Webb, the brother of Peggy, he had met him on the &s;tairs. Mr. Mac Fane as he de&s;cended was oppo&s;ite the window on the landing place, and his face was full in the light; while Frank could
<PB N="121" REF="122">
&s;carcely be &s;een by him, being then &s;e|veral &s;teps below him. His counte|nance is a remarkable one; it has a deep &s;car above the left eye; and Frank, &s;u&s;pecting him to be the accomplice of the man he was going to vi&s;it, had fixed it in his memory.</P>
<P>Frank has &s;ince been talking very &s;e|riou&s;ly with this brother of Peggy; and appears to have convinced him that his pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ion is as much that of a thief as his former. However, in this &s;hort &s;pace of time, without under&s;tand|ing the vile arts of a gambler, he has collected between two and three hun|dred pounds. Such is the folly with which money is &s;quandered at the&s;e places. While Mr. Mac Fane is ab&s;ent, he thinks him&s;elf in no danger; and
<PB N="122" REF="123">
&s;hould he return, he has been promi&s;ed the protection of our family, which he thinks a &s;ufficient guarantee; being ra|ther afraid of him as a de&s;perado than as an accu&s;er. Webb has therefore agreed to take a &s;hop, and exerci&s;e his trade as a ma&s;ter. He is a man of quick intellects; and, notwith&s;tanding all that he has done, has many good propen&s;i|ties. As a proof of the&s;e, his poor &s;i&s;ter, the kind Peggy, has infinite affection for him; and is &s;ure now that he will do well.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur and Edward have both been very &s;incere and hearty in their thanks to Frank: to which he an&s;wers, and an&s;wers truly, it was a &s;troke rather of good fortune than of fore&s;ight. But he has gained him&s;elf a character; and
<PB N="123" REF="124">
they are partly of opinion, that every thing mu&s;t pro&s;per which he undertakes. Aunt Wenbourne too overflows in his prai&s;e. Edward is her favourite; and Frank &s;tands now almo&s;t as high on her li&s;t as he was but a little while ago the rever&s;e; for Edward is continually talk|ing of him to her, and every word he &s;ays is orthodox. But opinions like the&s;e are too light, too full of prejudice, too mutable to be of much value.</P>
<P>Clifton kept away all the evening; however, after hearing the whole &s;tory, he was obliged to acknowledge that, let his other qualities be what they would, he could not have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as Frank in this affair; becau&s;e he could have known nothing of Mr. Mac Fane.
<PB N="124" REF="125">
But he did not forget that this was an accident, unfore&s;een at the time when Frank was tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>My con&s;tant rule, of equanimity of temper, has re&s;tored him to his wonted good-humour. But I perceive he re|grets the po&s;&s;ibility of any man equal|ling him in the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who&s;e friend&s;hip he cultivates. Alas! Why does he not rather &s;eek to &s;urpa&s;s them, than to envy their virtues?</P>
<P>He &s;ays he will propo&s;e an eulogium on Frank, and give a prize him&s;elf to the French Academy; for he finds he will never get &s;ufficiently prai&s;ed in England. He never knew &s;o eternal a theme for panegyric. In fine, it is evident, in de|&s;pite of his efforts to conceal it, that his
<PB N="125" REF="126">
jealou&s;y increa&s;es: and I &s;u&s;pect he feels this la&s;t deci&s;ion again&s;t him more &s;en&s;i|bly than any preceding circum&s;tance.</P>

<P><PB N="127" REF="128">
Yes, Fairfax, longer to palliate, or wilfully be blind to the partial edicts and haughty ordonnances of this proud beauty, were idioti&s;m! She has pre&s;umed too far; I am not quite &s;o tame a creature as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es. She &s;hall find I am not the clay, but the potter. I will mould, not be moulded. Poltron as I was, to think of &s;inking into the docile, dome&s;ticated, timid animal called hu&s;|band! But the lion's paws are not yet pared; beware then, my prince&s;s!</P>
<P>The lady would carry it with a high hand, Fairfax. But let her! If I not note her freaks, if I forget her imperious caprice, if my embittered mind &s;lumber in its intents, &s;ay not I am the proud|&s;pirited Clifton you once knew; that prompt, bold, and inflexible fellow,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
whom arrogance could rou&s;e, and in|jury inflame, but a &s;uffering, patient a&s;s; a meek pitiful thing, &s;uch as they would make me!</P>
<P>Wonder not that I now am angry, but that I have &s;o long been torpid. A little phren&s;y has re&s;tored the pal&s;ied &s;oul to life, and again has put its powers in motion. I'll play no more at que&s;|tions and commands&mdash;Or, if I do, it &s;hall only be to make &s;ure of my game.</P>
<P>I have been reproved, &s;ilenced, tongue|tied, brow-beaten; have made my&s;elf an ape, been placed behind the door, and have &s;hewed tricks for her diver&s;ion. But I am not muzzled yet: they &s;hall find me one of the <HI>ferae naturae.</HI></P>
<P>A mo&s;t excellent project, for&s;ooth! When I am &s;ufficiently familiarized to
<PB N="129" REF="130">
contradiction, rebuke, fillips on the fore|head, and raps on the knuckles, &s;he will then hear me my prayers, pack me off peaceably to bed for tonight, and gra|ciou&s;ly be&s;tow a pat and a promi&s;e upon me for tomorrow! There is danger in the whim, lady; beauteous though you are, and invincible as you may think your&s;elf. Model me!&mdash;No!&mdash;I am of a metal which not even your files can touch. You cannot knead, dough-bake, and temper me to your leaven.</P>
<P>Fairfax, &s;he had fa&s;cinated me! I own it! There is &s;uch incantation, in the &s;mall circle of her eye, as mortal man &s;carcely can re&s;i&s;t! I adored her; nay &s;till adore! But &s;he knows me not. I have a &s;oul of fire. She has driven me beyond the limits of patience.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
Her wi&s;dom degenerates into rhodo|montade. She will pre&s;cribe the hour and minute when &s;he &s;hall begin to love. She does not pretend to love me yet; and, if &s;he did, her looks, her manner would betray the fal&s;ehood of her heart.</P>
<P>Yet let me not wrong her, vexed though I am. Double dealing is not her error: &s;he is &s;ufficiently &s;incere.</P>
<P>Why would I hide it from my&s;elf? Her partialities all lead another way: ay and her pa&s;&s;ions too, if pa&s;&s;ions &s;he have. But this mo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible, this tor|menting, incoherent romance of deter|mining not to have any, I believe from my &s;oul, in part produces the effect &s;he intends, and almo&s;t enables her to keep her determination!</P>
<P>Still and eternally, this fellow! This
<PB N="131" REF="132">
Frank! Oh that I were an Italian, and that my con&s;cience would permit me to deal him the &s;tilletto!&mdash;Let him be|ware!&mdash;He is employed, preferred, prai&s;ed! It is eulogium everla&s;ting! Had Fame as many trumpets as &s;he has tongues and lies, they would all be in&s;uf|ficient. And not only &s;he but the whole family, father, brother, aunts, the devil knows who, each grateful &s;oul is oozing out the froth of its obligations!</P>
<P>Had they le&s;s cau&s;e, perhaps I &s;hould be le&s;s irritated: but he has re&s;cued the poor being of a brother, Edward St. Ives, who had neither courage nor capa|city to re&s;cue him&s;elf, from the gripe of a gambler. This Edward, who is one of the king's captains, God ble&s;s him, and who has &s;pent his fortune in learning the
<PB N="132" REF="133">
trade, not of a man of war, but of a man of fa&s;hion, having lo&s;t what ready mo|ney he had, &s;taked his honour again&s;t a cogger of dice, and was pre&s;ently tricked out of three thou&s;and guineas; which he was too poor in pocket to pay, and, if I gue&s;s right, too poor in &s;pirit afterward to face the ruffian whom he had made his companion.</P>
<P>So Mr. Henley, and it plea&s;e you, was cho&s;en, by father and daughter. Though &s;he owns &s;he propo&s;ed it fir&s;t; for &s;he does not &s;cruple to own all which &s;he does not &s;cruple to act. The holy mi&s;&s;ion was his, to dole out &s;alutary do|cuments of reproof, and apothegms of Epictetus; and to try whether he could not relea&s;e the bird-limed owl. I was overlooked! I am unfit for the office! I
<PB N="133" REF="134">
am but little wi&s;er than the booby bro|ther! Whereas Solomon him&s;elf, and the &s;even &s;ages to boot, are but &s;o many men of Gotham, when he is pre&s;ent. The quinte&s;&s;ence of all the knowledge, wit, wi&s;dom, and genius that ever &s;aw the &s;un, from the infantine days of ABC and king Cadmus, to the&s;e miraculous times of intuition and metaphy&s;ical leger|demain, is bottled up in his brain; from which it foams and whizzes in our ears, every time di&s;cretion can be induced to draw the cork of &s;ilence.&mdash;Once again, let him beware!</P>
<P>I then am &s;elected for no other pur|po&s;e but for her morality to make expe|riments upon.&mdash;She is called wi&s;e, and wi&s;e &s;he may be; nay wi&s;e &s;he is, or at lea&s;t all other women, &s;he being pre|&s;ent,

are intolerably fooli&s;h. But, by heaven, this is no proof of her wi&s;dom! I am the &s;cape-goat!&mdash;I!&mdash;Be it &s;o!&mdash;Should &s;he be caught in her own &s;pringe, who can &s;ay I am to blame?</P>
<P>She has &s;een my anger, for I could not hide it; but &s;he has &s;een it only in part. A hypocrite &s;he wants, and a hypocrite &s;he &s;hall have. I will act the farce which &s;he is compo&s;ing; let her look to the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>I begin to think that marriage and I &s;hall never meet; for, if I with&s;tand her, woman cannot tempt me. And her I &s;hall with&s;tand. At lea&s;t I never will have her till I have humbled her; and then perhaps I &s;hall not be in the hu|mour. And yet my heart tells me that I &s;hall. For in &s;pite of all its anger, in
<PB N="135" REF="136">
&s;pite of her inju&s;tice and glaring indif|ference, the remembrance of which puts me in a fever, it would be mi&s;ery to know her, recollect her, and live without her.</P>
<P>But, patience! Her pride &s;hall fir&s;t be lowered. I mu&s;t command, not be commanded: and, when my clemency is implored, I will then take time to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>My brain is in a ferment, and its vari|ous engines are already in commotion. She her&s;elf, her hated favourite, her fa|ther, her brother, her aunt, her uncle, her maid, every creature that &s;urrounds her mu&s;t each and all contribute to my purpo&s;es and plots. Parts fit for the actors mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned. The how and what I know not yet preci&s;ely, for I have &s;carcely &s;ketched the canvas; but
<PB N="136" REF="137">
I have conceived &s;ome bold and ma&s;|terly &s;trokes, and I fore&s;ee the execution mu&s;t be daring and impa&s;&s;ioned. I am in ha&s;te to begin, and my hot o&s;cillatory &s;pirits can with difficulty be tamed to the &s;till pau&s;e of prudence and premedita|tion: they are eager for the fight, and think caution a tardy general, if not a coward.</P>
<P>I know not how it is, but when I am angry, very angry, I feel as if I were in my element. My blood delights to boil, and my pa&s;&s;ions to bubble. I hate &s;till water. An agitated &s;ea! An evening when the fiery &s;un forebodes a &s;tormy morning, and the black-ba&s;ed clouds ri&s;e, like mountains with hoary tops, to tell me tempe&s;ts are brewing! The&s;e give emotion and delight &s;upreme! Oh
<PB N="137" REF="138">
for a mi&s;tre&s;s &s;uch as I could imagine, and &s;uch as Anna St. Ives moulded by me could make! One that could vary her per&s;on, her plea&s;ures, and her pa&s;|&s;ions, purpo&s;ely to give mine variety! Who&s;e daily and nightly &s;tudy all &s;hould centre in me, and my gratifications! Who&s;e eyes &s;hould fla&s;h lightning to rou&s;e the chilled &s;en&s;ations, and &s;hed appea&s;ing dews to quench the fire of rage. The&s;e are the objects in which I could delight; the&s;e the devotions I re|quire. Change for me. A true Engli&s;h day; in which winter and &s;ummer, hail, rain, and &s;un&s;hine meet and min|gle.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten one chief cau&s;e of my re&s;entment; though the mo&s;t fortunate one I could have wi&s;hed for to

promote my purpo&s;e. This Sir Arthur dallies with me. I find, from various items which the candour of her mind has &s;uffered to e&s;cape, that the motive is po|verty. I am glad of it. I will urge and hurry her into a promi&s;e to be mine. The genero&s;ity of her temper will aid me. I will plead the injury done me by he&s;itation. I feel it, and therefore my pleadings will be natural. It is her pride to repair the wrongs which others commit. This pride and this heroi&s;m of &s;oul, which I mu&s;t acknowledge in her are unaffected, &s;hall be the main en|gines with which I will work. Without the&s;e perhaps I might de&s;pair; but with them hold my&s;elf &s;ecure of victory.</P>
<P>Yes, lady of the high &s;ciences, you mu&s;t de&s;cend, and let my &s;tar mount the

<P>As for the re&s;t of the family, more or le&s;s, they are all fools; therefore are nei|ther to be feared nor pitied. On her perhaps I may have compa&s;&s;ion, when I have taught her contrition, and when &s;he knows me for her &s;uperior.</P>
<P>I have written a volume, yet have not half di&s;burthened my labouring mind. Oh that I could pre&s;ent the picture to you complete! That I could paint her as &s;he is; all beauty, all excellence, all kindne&s;s, all fro&s;t! That I could &s;hew the &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;t in the heyday in&s;o|lence of her power; pretending to guide, reform, humble, and &s;ubjugate me; while love and vengeance &s;well my heart,

hypocri&s;y &s;mooths my face, and plots innumerable bu&s;y my brain! It is a fruitful, rich, re&s;plendent &s;cene; of which, Fairfax, you have no conception. Me you have known, intimately, and are hone&s;t enough to own you have admired: but of her all ideal tracings are contemp|tible!</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould this knight of the magic lanthorn be forgotten; this Ne&s;tor ju|nior; this tormenting rival&mdash;Oh how I could cur&s;e! He who &s;tands, as ready as if Satan had &s;ent him, to feed the &s;pread|ing flames with oil! He fills his place on the canvas. And who knows but I may teach him, yet, to do his office as he ought? How would it delight me! There is an intemperance of &s;uperiority which no human patience can &s;upport,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
nor any acts of kindne&s;s compen&s;ate. A triumph over her will indeed be a tri|umph over him, and therefore doubly delicious!</P>
<P>I grant he forbears to prate of the life he gave me. But am I not re|minded of the oppre&s;&s;ive gift every time he dares to contradict me? Would I endure his interference as I do; would I be &s;houldered and butted at, by him; would I permit his opinion to be a&s;ked, or his dogmas to &s;ilence me, were I not burthened with this una&s;ked benefit?</P>
<P>Infatuated lunatic, as I was! But I am in the &s;chool of prudence, at pre&s;ent; and &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall learn a little &s;ome time; though I do not know when; &s;ince, I am told, it is not ea&s;y to learn a trade one hates.</P>

Mean while I pay my court a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the two peers, Evelyn and Fitz Allen, who at pre&s;ent are both in town. No|thing mu&s;t be neglected, nothing left unprepared.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NEED I tell my affectionate friend how great the plea&s;ure is which I receive from her letters, and from that free com|munication of thought which &s;o effectu|ally tends to awaken the be&s;t emotions of mind, and make us emulate each
<PB N="145" REF="146">
other's virtues? Like her I &s;it down, now while memory is awake, to relate &s;uch material incidents as have happened &s;ince la&s;t I wrote.</P>
<P>The anger of Clifton is &s;oftened into approbation. The mo&s;t generous minds are liable, from the acutene&s;s of their &s;en&s;ibility, to be unju&s;t. We are once again very good friends.</P>
<P>Not but we have ju&s;t been engaged in a very impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cene. The &s;ubject of family con&s;ent was revived by him; and, as I intended, I informed him that delay &s;eemed inevitable.</P>
<P>The &s;truggle of his feelings, when he heard it, appeared to be violent. His exclamations were characteri&s;tic of his habitual impetuo&s;ity; the &s;trength of them excited &s;en&s;ations, and alarms,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
which prove the power he has over the pa&s;&s;ions. Oh how I de&s;ire to &s;ee that power well directed! How precious, how potent will it then become!</P>
<P>One thing, and only one, he vehe|mently affirmed, could appea&s;e the per|turbation of his mind, and pre&s;erve him from wretchedne&s;s which none but tho&s;e who felt like him could conceive&mdash;</P>
<P>And what, I a&s;ked, was that?&mdash;</P>
<P>He dur&s;t not &s;peak it&mdash;Yet &s;peak he mu&s;t, plead he mu&s;t. Should he fail, phren&s;y, de&s;pair, he knew not what, but &s;omething fearful would indubitably follow&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, what was it?&mdash;</P>
<P>Might he hope? It depended on me; and denial and di&s;traction were the &s;ame&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
He made me &s;hudder! And, &s;erious when I heard it though I found his de|mand to be, his manner in&s;pired a con|fu&s;ed dread of &s;omething repugnant; &s;omething eminently wrong.</P>
<P>He ventured at la&s;t to &s;peak. I be|lieve he watched his moment. The pa&s;&s;ions, Loui&s;a, however di&s;turbed, are always cunning. He demanded a pro|mi&s;e, &s;olemn and irrevocable, to be his.</P>
<P>Such a promi&s;e, I an&s;wered, was un|nece&s;&s;ary; and, if at all, could only be given conditionally&mdash;</P>
<P>There were no conditions to which he was not ready to &s;ub&s;cribe&mdash;</P>
<P>I replied, too much readine&s;s denoted too little reflection; and not fortitude &s;ufficient to fulfil &s;uch conditions.</P>
<P>Fortitude could never fail him, having
<PB N="148" REF="149">
me not only for an example but a re|ward. Again he repeated, without my promi&s;e, my &s;acred promi&s;e, he really and &s;eriou&s;ly feared di&s;traction! That this was weakne&s;s he was ready to allow: but if it were true, and true it was, &s;hould I want love, I yet had too much benevolence not to de&s;ire to avert con&s;e|quences which, beyond all others, are horrible to imagination.</P>
<P>He has &s;urely very con&s;iderable know|ledge of the human heart; for his tone and manner produced all the effect he intended. I had fore&s;een the probability of &s;uch a reque&s;t, though not all the ur|gency with which it was made, and had argued the que&s;tion of right and wrong. My conclu&s;ion had been that &s;uch a pro|mi&s;e, with certain provi&s;os, was a duty;
<PB N="149" REF="150">
and accordingly I gave it; &s;tipulating a power to retract, &s;hould experience teach us that our minds and principles could not a&s;&s;imilate.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he was not &s;atisfied. Intrea|ties the mo&s;t importunate that language could &s;upply were repeated, that I &s;hould make no &s;uch exceptions. They were impo&s;&s;ibilities; needle&s;s, but tormenting. Finding however that I was re&s;olved, he &s;oftened into acquie&s;cence, thanked me with all the tran&s;ports which might be expected from him, and ki&s;&s;ed my hand. He would not have been &s;o &s;atisfied, had I not very &s;eriou&s;ly repul&s;ed the encroach|ing freedoms which I had lately found him a&s;&s;uming; &s;ince which he is become more guarded.</P>
<P>What latent incon&s;i&s;tency is there,
<PB N="150" REF="151">
Loui&s;a, in my conduct, which can incite the alarms to which I feel my&s;elf &s;ub|ject? The moment I had made the pro|mi&s;e I &s;huddered; and, while acting from the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty, and the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of doing good, I felt as if the act were reprehen&s;ible and un|ju&s;t.&mdash;It is the words of Frank that are the cau&s;e: on them my mind dwells, and painfully repeats them, as if in a deli|rium: like a &s;inging in the ear, the toll|ing of death-bells, or the burthen of &s;ome tragic ditty, which memory, in its own de&s;pite, harps upon, and mutters to it&s;elf!&mdash;<Q><HI>He is certain that I act from mi&s;taken principles!&mdash;To the end of time he &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in thinking me his by right!</HI></Q></P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;omething ami&s;s, &s;ome|thing
<PB N="151" REF="152">
feeble in my mind, &s;ince the de|ci&s;ion of rea&s;on cannot defend me from the awe which this &s;urely too ha&s;ty, too po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion in&s;pires! It haunts my very dreams!</P>
<P>Clifton left me; and, being gone, I went into the parlour. Frank was there. He had a book in his hand, and tears in his eyes. I never beheld a look more melancholy. Capable as he is of re&s;i&s;t|ing the cowardice of &s;elf-complaint and gloom, &s;till there are moments, I per|ceive, in which he can yield; and, &s;igh|ing over others woes, can ca&s;t a retro|&s;pective glance on &s;elf. He had been reading the Julia of Rou&s;&s;eau. The pic|ture given by St. Preux of his feelings had awakened &s;ympathy too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
We fell into conver&s;ation. I wi&s;hed to turn his thoughts into a more cheer|ful channel; but my own partook too much of the &s;ame medium, not to a&s;&s;i|milate them&s;elves in part to his languor.</P>
<P>You &s;eem pen&s;ive, Frank. What is the &s;ubject of your meditations?</P>
<P>The &s;orrows of St. Preux, madam.</P>
<P>Then you are among the rocks of Meillerie? Or &s;tanding a partaker of the danger of Julia on the dreadful preci|pice?</P>
<P>No, madam. The divine Julia is dead!&mdash;[Had you heard the &s;igh he gave, Loui&s;a&mdash;!] I am at a pa&s;&s;age which I &s;u&s;pect to be &s;till more &s;ublime. I am &s;ure it is equally heart-rending.</P>
<P>Ay!&mdash;Which is that?</P>
<P>It is Clara, at the table of Wolmar;
<PB N="153" REF="154">
where the child, with &s;uch &s;implicity, conjures up the infantine but almo&s;t per|fect &s;emblance of the dead. If ever laughter in&s;pired the horrors of di&s;trac|tion, it was the laugh of Clara!</P>
<P>It is a wonderful pa&s;&s;age. But I find you were rather contemplating the &s;or|rows of the friend than of the lover.</P>
<P>Pardon me, madam. I was con&s;ider|ing, &s;ince the friend was thus on the very brink of de&s;pair, what mu&s;t be the force of mind which could pre&s;erve the lover.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip and love, in &s;uch minds, are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o, madam.</P>
<P>Can there be any doubt?</P>
<P>When the lover and the friend are
<PB N="154" REF="155">
united, the heart is reluctant to own its feelings can be equalled.</P>
<P>Ought you not to avoid &s;uch a book, Frank; at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>If it led me into error; otherwi&s;e not. I think I know what were the author's mi&s;takes; and he not only teaches but impre&s;&s;es, rivets, volumes of truth in my mind.</P>
<P>The recollection of what had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed with Clifton forced it&s;elf upon me, Loui&s;a; it made me de&s;irous of put|ting a que&s;tion to Frank on the &s;ubject, and I a&s;ked&mdash;</P>
<P>What is your opinion of promi&s;es?</P>
<P>I think them &s;uperfluous, nugatory, and therefore ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Without exception?</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">
Yes&mdash;We cannot promi&s;e to do wrong: or, if we do, cannot perform&mdash;Neither can we, without guilt, refrain from doing right; whether we have or have not promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some glimp&s;e of this truth, for I per|ceive it to be one, had &s;hot acro&s;s my mind; but not with the per&s;picuity of your propo&s;ition&mdash;I am inclined to be a rude interrogator: I have another que&s;|tion to a&s;k [He bowed]&mdash;I own you are &s;eldom wrong, and yet I hope&mdash;[I re|member, Loui&s;a, that I gave a deep &s;igh here; and it mu&s;t not be concealed]&mdash;I hope that you have been wrong, once in your life.</P>
<P>Madam!</P>
<P>But perhaps you have changed your opi|nion
<PB N="156" REF="157">
&mdash;Do you &s;till think as you did?&mdash;Are you &s;till <HI>certain that I act from mi&s;|taken principles?</HI> [He in&s;tantly under|&s;tood me&mdash;Had you &s;een his look, Lou|i&s;a&mdash;!]</P>

<P>OLIVER, I mu&s;t fly!&mdash;There is neither peace nor &s;afety for me if I re|main&mdash;Re&s;olution begins to faint under the&s;e repeated and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;truggles&mdash;Life is u&s;ele&s;s, virtue inefficient, time murdered, and I mu&s;t fly!&mdash;Here I can do nothing but doubt, hope, de|&s;pair,
<PB N="159" REF="160">
and linger in uncertainty: my body li&s;tle&s;s, my mind incoherent, my days wa&s;ted in vain reveries on ab&s;urd po&s;&s;ibilities, and my nights haunted by the confu&s;ed phantoms of a di&s;turbed and &s;ickly brain!&mdash;I mu&s;t fly!</P>
<P>But whither?&mdash;I know not!&mdash;If I mean to be truly ma&s;ter of my affections, &s;eas mu&s;t &s;eparate us! Impo&s;&s;ibility mu&s;t be made more impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;'Tis that, Oliver, which kills me, that ignus fa|tuus of fal&s;e hope&mdash;Were &s;he even mar|ried, if her hu&s;band were not immortal, I feel as if my heart would &s;till dwell and feed on the meagre May-be! It re|fu&s;es to renounce her, and makes a thou|&s;and and a thou&s;and efforts to oblige me again to urge its ju&s;t claims.</P>
<P>I am in the labyrinth of contradictions,
<PB N="160" REF="161">
and know not how to get out. My own feelings, my remarks on hers, the looks, actions and di&s;cour&s;e of this dangerous lover are all embroiled, all incongruous, all illu&s;ory. I &s;eem to tempt her to evil by my &s;tay, him I offend, and my&s;elf I torment&mdash;I mu&s;t therefore begone!</P>
<P>Oliver, our hearts are united!&mdash;Truth and principle have made them one, and prejudice and pride have not the power to di&s;&s;ever them!&mdash;She her&s;elf feels this intimately, yet per&s;i&s;ts in her mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I think, Oliver, it is not what the world or what &s;he under&s;tands by love which occa&s;ions this anarchy of mind. I think I could command and reprove my pa&s;|&s;ions into into &s;ilence. Either I mi&s;take my|&s;elf, or even now, &s;ituated as I am, I could rejoice were there a certainty, nay
<PB N="161" REF="162">
were there but &s;trong probabilities, that her favourite purpo&s;e on Clifton &s;hould be effected. But the more I meditate, and my hours, days, and weeks pa&s;s away and are lo&s;t in meditation on this &s;ub|ject, the more does my mind per&s;i&s;t in its doubts, and my heart in its claims.</P>
<P>Surely, Oliver, &s;he is under a double mi&s;take! Surely her rea&s;onings both on him and me are erroneous.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be hone&s;t, Oliver, and tell thee all my feelings, fears, and &s;u&s;picions. They may be fal&s;e. I hope they are, but they exi&s;t. I imagine I perceive in him repeated and violent &s;truggles to appear what he is not, nay what I doubt he would de&s;pi&s;e him&s;elf for being!</P>
<P>Is not this an unju&s;tifiable, a cruel ac|cu&s;ation? Why have I this keen this jea|lous
<PB N="162" REF="163">
&s;en&s;ibility? Is it not di&s;honourable to my under&s;tanding?</P>
<P>Yet &s;hould there be real danger, and I blind to it! Should I neglect to warn her, or rather to guard and pre&s;erve her from harm, where &s;hall I find con&s;ola|tion?</P>
<P>Oliver! There are times when the&s;e fears haunt me &s;o powerfully that my heart recoils, my blood freezes, and my whole frame is &s;haken with the terrific dream!&mdash;A dream?&mdash;Yes, it mu&s;t be a dream! If not, the perver&s;ion of his mind and the obduracy of his heart are to me wholly incomprehen&s;ible!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be more guarded!&mdash;Wrong|fully to doubt were irreparably to injure! My fir&s;t care mu&s;t be to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Mark, Oliver, how the&s;e wanderings
<PB N="163" REF="164">
of the mind mi&s;lead and torment me! One minute I mu&s;t fly, to recover my|&s;elf, and not to di&s;turb and way-lay others; the next I mu&s;t &s;tay, to protect her who perhaps is be&s;t able to protect her&s;elf!</P>
<P>I have no plan: I labour to form one in vain. That &s;ingle channel into which my thoughts are ince&s;&s;antly impelled is de&s;tructive of all order and connexion. The efforts of the under&s;tanding are a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated by the emotions of the heart; till the reproaches of principle become intolerable, and the delu&s;ions of hope di&s;tracting!&mdash;A &s;tate of &s;uch painful in|utility is both criminal and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The kindne&s;s of the father, brother, and aunt, the &s;ympathi&s;ing tenderne&s;s which bur&s;ts from and overcomes the
<PB N="164" REF="165">
benign Anna, the delay of the mar|riage&mdash;Oliver!&mdash;I was recapitulating the &s;eeming in&s;pirations of my good angel, and have conjured up my chief tormentor!&mdash;This delay!&mdash;Where does it originate?&mdash;With whom?&mdash;With&mdash;! I mu&s;t fly!&mdash;This of all motives is the mo&s;t irrefragable!&mdash;I mu&s;t fly!&mdash;But when, or how, or where, what I mu&s;t undertake, whither go, or what become, is yet all vague and incoherent conjec|ture.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. HENLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now &s;ome time &s;ince I received your letter. It a&s;toni&s;hed and I mu&s;t &s;ay offended me &s;o much, that I do not yet know what an&s;wer to return. You &s;ay I have thrown you into a quandary, Mr. Henley; and I can very &s;incerely return
<PB N="166" REF="167">
your compliment, Mr. Henley; for no|thing can be more unintelligible than your whole letter is to me, Mr. Henley. And I mu&s;t &s;ay, I think it not very grateful in you, Mr. Henley, nor in my opinion very proper, to write me &s;uch a letter, Mr. Henley; that is as far as I under&s;tand its meaning, Mr. Henley. I have no de&s;ire, Mr. Henley, to quarrel with you, if I can help it; but I mu&s;t &s;ay I think you have forgotten your&s;elf, Mr. Henley. It is very unlike the man|ner in which you have been u&s;ed to com|port your&s;elf to me, Mr. Henley; for, if I under&s;tand you rightly, which I own it is very difficult to do, you threaten me with foreclo&s;ures, Mr. Henley; which I mu&s;t &s;ay, Mr. Henley, is very improper demeanour from you to me, Mr. Hen|ley.
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Not that I &s;eek a rupture with you, Mr. Henley; though I mu&s;t &s;ay that all this lies very heavy upon my mind, Mr. Henley.</P>
<P>You in&s;inuate that you are grown rich, I think, Mr. Henley. So much the better for you. And you &s;eem to know, Mr. Henley, that I am grown poor: or I think, Mr. Henley, you would not have written to me in a &s;tyle which I could almo&s;t be tempted to call impertinent, but that I wi&s;h to avoid a quarrel with you, Mr. Henley, unle&s;s you force me to it. There is law as you &s;ay, Mr. Henley, for every man; but law is a very fretful and indeed fearful thing, to which you know I am aver&s;e, Mr. Henley. Not but there are pro|ceedings, Mr. Henley, which may
<PB N="168" REF="169">
lead me to con&s;ider how far it is nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay, Mr. Henley, that my a&s;to|ni&s;hment is very great, after writing me word, as you did, that I might have the money, which I took very kindly of you, that you &s;hould now contradict your&s;elf &s;o flagrantly [I am obliged to repeat it, Mr. Henley] and tell me it is not to be had. What you mean by the whats, and the whys, and the wherefores being forthcoming, is really above my capa|city, Mr. Henley; and I reque&s;t you would &s;peak plainly, that I may give a plain an&s;wer.</P>
<P>You &s;ay you can keep your hat on your head, and look your betters in the face, Mr. Henley. May be &s;o. But I eave it to your better judgment to con|&s;ider,
<PB N="169" REF="170">
Mr. Henley, whether you ought to forget that they are your betters.</P>
<P>There are indeed, as you tell me, wheels within wheels, Mr. Henley; for I find that you, and not my &s;on, are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Edgemoor e&s;tate. God ble&s;s us all, and give us clean hands and hearts, Mr. Henley! I &s;ay no more! Though I mu&s;t &s;ay that, when I heard it, my hair almo&s;t &s;tood an end!</P>
<P>You talk a great deal about &s;ome|body's &s;on, Mr. Henley. You have puzzled me much; but I think you mu&s;t mean your own &s;on. Though what you mean be&s;ide is more than I can divine. I am very unwilling, Mr. Hen|ley, to think any thing to your di&s;advan|tage; and I mu&s;t &s;ay that I could wi&s;h you would not &s;peak by ifs, and ands, and
<PB N="170" REF="171">
innuendos; but let me know at once what you mean, and all you mean, and then I &s;hall know how to act.</P>
<P>Your &s;on, I own, is a very excellent young gentleman; a very extraordinary young gentleman; and no per&s;on can be more ready to acknowledge his me|rits than I, and my whole family. You &s;eem offended with my offer of a com|mi&s;&s;ion for him; which I own a&s;toni&s;hes me; for I mu&s;t &s;ay, Mr. Henley, that I thought I was doing you an act of kind|ne&s;s. Not that I blame your prudence, &s;ir; or your aver&s;ion to the prodigal &s;pendthrifts, who too frequently are fond of red coats and cockades, which are &s;o offen&s;ive to your notions of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>I am not unwilling to own that I, and all my family, are even under obliga|tions
<PB N="171" REF="172">
to your &s;on. For which rea&s;on I am the more inclined to overlook what I mu&s;t &s;ay does not plea&s;e me, in your la&s;t very unexpected letter. Let me tell you, Mr. Henley, that I cannot but hope you will think better of it; and that you will u&s;e your kind endeavours to get me the money, according to your promi&s;e, which I &s;hall take very friendly of you, &s;ir; and &s;hall be willing to do any thing for your &s;on, in that ca&s;e, for your &s;ake as well as for his own, which rea&s;on can require.</P>
<P>I beg, Mr. Henley, you will con&s;ider very &s;eriou&s;ly of this; and I &s;hould hope you would not forget former times, and the very many favours which, in my life, I have done you. I do a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, I have the utmo&s;t de&s;ire to continue
<PB N="172" REF="173">
on a good under&s;tanding with you; but I think I have &s;ome right to expect your compliance from motives of rea&s;on, not to &s;ay of gratitude. So, committing this to your con&s;ideration, and expect|ing an agreeable an&s;wer, I remain, &s;ir, as u&s;ual,</P>

<SALUTE>MOST ONNURABLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT doth appear as how your onnur be amifft. Whereby I did a partly a queery as much; thof &s;o be as it be no fault of mine. For why? There be rea&s;ons and cau&s;es. For when as a man has a no|think to fear of nobody, I am of a mind
<PB N="174" REF="175">
that a may pen his thofts to any man. Why not? Always a &s;avin and ex|ceptin your onnurable onnur.</P>
<P>And a&s;t for a man's a portin him&s;elf, there be times and &s;ea&s;ons for all thinks. Whereof as Friar Bacon &s;aid to Friar Bungy and of the Brazen-head, A time was&mdash;A time is&mdash;And a time is pa&s;t. And a&s;t for a threatening about fore|clo&s;ures, why what have I to &s;ay to a gen|tleman, if a will not redeem his mort|gages when the time be? The law mu&s;t look to it, to be &s;ure. Always a &s;avin and exceptin your onnurable onnur, &s;till &s;ay I. So that it be altogether compus mentus that quarrels and rupturs are none of my &s;eekin. Whereby your onnur|able onnur will look to that. No man can deny that every man has a rite to
<PB N="175" REF="176">
his own. For why? A pays &s;cot and lot, and has a nothink for it but law.</P>
<P>And a&s;t for a man's a growin of rich, why as I do take it a's a not the wor&s;e for that. And a&s;t for a man's a growin of poor, why a what had I to do, thof &s;o be that &s;ome be wi&s;e and &s;ome be other|wi&s;e? Whereof &s;o long as the rhino do ring, the man is the man, and the ma&s;|ter's the ma&s;ter. A's a buzzard in grain that do flicker, and fleer, and tell a gen|tleman a be no better nur a bob gud|geon, a cau&s;e a do &s;end the yellow ham|mers a &s;lying; for thof it might a be happen to be true enough, a would get &s;mall thanks for his pains.

Plain and po&s;itive; that's be&s;t, when a man do find the &s;hoe to pinch.</P>
<P>And a&s;t for law, why he that has a got the longe&s;t head will have a mo&s;t on't for money: and he that has a got the longe&s;t pur&s;e will behappen not to be the fir&s;t to cry peccavi. Whereof if a man do don his hat on his head, an a &s;ee good cau&s;e, why not? For I do a warrant a will &s;ee good cau&s;e, an a do doff it under his arm.</P>
<P>Whereby every why has a wherefore.

Any fool can a put down his five no|things; but a's a clever kinchin an a can place a &s;o much as a I afore 'em.

Where|by an it comes to a huff an a gruff, a may not chu&s;e to be arm a kimbo'd, any more nur another; for a may be happen to have a Rowland for an Oliver. A may behappen to be no Jack-a-farthin wea|zle-faced whip&s;ter. A may have &s;tock and block to go to work upon; and may give a rum for a glum: always a &s;avin and exceptin your onnurable on|nur.

<P>Whereof thof a man be but a Mi&s;ter, a may behappen to buy and &s;ell a knight of the &s;hire: that is under fa|vour, and a &s;avin and exceptin of your onnurable onnur. For why? I be as ready to a quit my hands of quarrels and rupturs as another.</P>

Whereof his younk onnur was all a mort, and a down in the mouth, when a did come to me. The world was wide, and a might a gone further and a fared wor&s;e. A's a dolt indeed that will part with money, and not have money's

<P>Whereby one man's hair mayhap may &s;tand an end as well as another's, ex|ceptin that I wears a wig. An I give the kole, I'll have the dole. And a&s;t for &s;omebody's &s;on, if &s;o be as a man

<P>To be &s;ure your onnur is &s;o good as to &s;ay my &s;on is a younk gentleman, and &s;o forth. Whereby this gracious and ever mercyfool lovin kindne&s;s would go to the cockles of my heart; ay and my chitterlins would crow, and I &s;hould &s;ing O be joyfool, if &s;o be as I did find as words wus any think but wind. Whereof when your onnurable onnur is
<PB N="181" REF="182">
compul&s;ionated, willy nilly, to be &s;o all bountifool as to profe&s;s to the ownin of obligations, why that is &s;ummut.

<P>Whereby had thinks a bin as they might a bin, why then indeed it would a bin &s;ummut. But as to the wherewith|alls of the twenty thou&s;and pounds, be|ing as it be, why the think is unpo&s;&s;able to be done. For why? The ca&s;e is al|tered. Whereof it is be&s;t to be down|right.

<P>And a&s;t for favours received, why may be &s;o. But what then? Since if &s;o be thof it wus &s;ometimes fair, why it wus &s;ometimes foul.

<P>I HAVE had a &s;cene with Frank, which affected me much, and which has occa&s;ioned another quarrel, or kind of a quarrel, with Clifton. Sir Arthur had ju&s;t left the room. He had been a&s;king Frank whether there were any po&s;&s;ible way by which he could &s;erve him. We
<PB N="185" REF="186">
all were his debtors; very deeply; and he &s;hould be happy to find any mode of di&s;charging the obligation. Sir Arthur &s;poke with an earne&s;tne&s;s which, in him, is by no means cu&s;tomary. But Frank had nothing to a&s;k, nothing to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting at my harp&s;ichord, amu&s;|ing my&s;elf; and, Sir Arthur being gone, &s;topped to tell Frank how &s;incerely I joined in Sir Arthur's feelings.</P>
<P>I have nothing, madam, &s;aid he, to hope from Sir Arthur: but to you I have a reque&s;t to make, which you would greatly oblige me &s;hould you grant&mdash;</P>
<P>I trembled, Loui&s;a. I was afraid of &s;ome new conte&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions; a re|vival of ideas which I my&s;elf had &s;o lately, and &s;o inadvertently, called to mind. I am per&s;uaded the blood for|&s;ook
<PB N="186" REF="187">
my cheeks, when I a&s;ked him what it was: for Frank, with a tenderne&s;s in his voice that was indeed honourable to his heart, prayed, conjured me not to be alarmed&mdash;It was a trifle&mdash;He would be filent&mdash;He would not give me a mo|ment's pain to gratify a million of &s;uch &s;illy wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He both moved and revived me. It could not be any thing very dreadful, and I entreated him to &s;peak. There was nothing he could a&s;k I would re|fu&s;e.</P>
<P>He he&s;itated, and I then became ur|gent. At la&s;t he named&mdash;His &s;ong!&mdash;Again, Loui&s;a, he almo&s;t &s;truck me to the heart!&mdash;He feared he offended me; but there was &s;omething &s;o enchanting in the air that he could not forget it,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
could not re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s a copy.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e. I went to my papers, and brought it. The evil &s;pirit of thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, and when I delivered it I a&s;ked&mdash;Is there any thing el&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P>Your kindne&s;s, madam, &s;aid he, is unalterable. Could I?&mdash;Dur&s;t I&mdash;?</P>
<P>What?&mdash;</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>Speak!&mdash;</P>
<P>He laid the &s;ong upon the mu&s;ic|de&s;k, and looked&mdash;No no&mdash;I will not attempt to tell you how!</P>
<P>Words were needle&s;s; they could not petition with &s;uch eloquence&mdash;A barbarian could not have refu&s;ed. I rambled over the keys, hemmed, and
<PB N="188" REF="189">
endeavoured to collect my&s;elf. At la&s;t a &s;en&s;e of propriety, of rea&s;on, of princi|ple, came to my aid, and bade me be ma&s;ter of my mind. I began to &s;ing, but no effort could enable me to give that expre&s;&s;ion of which I had before found the words &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>Could you think it, Loui&s;a? Do you now fore&s;ee, do you forebode what hap|pened?&mdash;Your brother came in!&mdash;</P>
<P>To have &s;topped, to have u&s;ed eva|&s;ion, to have had recour&s;e to fal&s;ehood would have turned an act of virtue into contemptible vice. I continued. Clif|ton came and looked over my &s;houlder. The mu&s;ic was on one &s;heet of paper, the words were on another, in the writing of Frank. Your brother knew the hand.</P>
<P>When I had ended, Frank took both

<P>At length, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not hav|ing done or at lea&s;t intended to do wrong gave me courage. I determined not to wait to be que&s;tioned: I a&s;ked him how he liked the &s;ong.</P>
<P>Oh! Exceedingly!&mdash;It was very fine!&mdash;Very fine!</P>
<P>The words are Mr. Henley's.</P>
<P>I imagined as much, madam.</P>
<P>I thought them expre&s;&s;ive, and amu&s;ed my&s;elf with putting a tune to them.</P>
<P>I am as good as a witch!</P>
<P>How did you like the &s;ubject?</P>
<P>What &s;ubject, madam?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
Of the words.</P>
<P>I really don't know&mdash;I have forgot|ten&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, you &s;aid you thought them very fine!</P>
<P>Oh! Yes!&mdash;True!&mdash;Very fine!&mdash;All about love&mdash;I recollect.</P>
<P>Well, and having &s;o much faith in love, you do not think them the wor&s;e for that.</P>
<P>Oh, by no means!&mdash;But I thought you had.</P>
<P>Love in a &s;ong may be pardonable.</P>
<P>E&s;pecially, madam, if the &s;ong be written by Mr. Henley.</P>
<P>Clifton!&mdash;You almo&s;t teach me to de&s;pair!&mdash;You do not know me!&mdash;Perhaps however I am more to blame than you, at pre&s;ent. Timidity has
<PB N="191" REF="192">
given me &s;ome appearance of con&s;cious guilt, which my heart di&s;avows. But, as there is &s;carcely any error more dan|gerous to felicity than &s;u&s;picion, I own I am &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o frequently its &s;lave. Never think of that woman for a wife, in whom you cannot confide. And a&s;k your&s;elf whether I ought to marry a man who cannot di&s;cover that I merit his confidence?</P>
<P>I find, indeed, implicit faith to be as nece&s;&s;ary in love as in religion&mdash;But you know your power, madam.</P>
<P>An indifferent &s;pectator would rather &s;ay you know yours.</P>
<P>You will not go, madam, and leave me thus?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;ery?</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">
I have letters to write, and vi&s;its to pay.</P>
<P>You cannot be &s;o cruel?&mdash;By heaven, madam, this torment is more than nature can &s;upport!</P>

<P>Stay at lea&s;t for a moment!&mdash;Hear me!&mdash;Do not leave me in the&s;e doubts!</P>
<P>What doubts?&mdash;Do I not tell you the words are Mr. Henley's? The air is mine. If &s;etting them were any guilt, it is a guilt of which I am not con&s;cious. Shew me that it is criminal and I will in&s;tantly retract. We mu&s;t either over|come
<PB N="193" REF="194">
the&s;e narrow, the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h propen|&s;ities, or we &s;hall hope in vain to be happy.</P>
<P>I&mdash;I&mdash;I make no accu&s;ation&mdash;</P>
<P>Do but examine before you accu&s;e, and I will patiently hear and cheerfully an&s;wer to accu&s;ation. If you think it wrong in me not to treat virtue and ge|nius with neglect, bring me your proofs, and if I cannot demon&s;trate their fallacy I will own my error. Let me add, the accu&s;ation of rea&s;on is a duty; from which, though painful, we ought not to &s;hrink. It is the mi&s;taken accu&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;ions only at which ju&s;tice bids the heart revolt.</P>
<P>Here, Loui&s;a, once again I left him, with &s;truggles apparently more acute than the former. And my own mind is

&s;o affected, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed as it were by crowds of ideas, that I do not yet know whether this were an accident to be wi&s;h|ed, or even whether I have entirely acted as I ought. My mind will grow calmer, and I will then begin the &s;cru|tiny.</P>
<P>I am minute in relating the&s;e particu|lars, becau&s;e I am very de&s;irous of doing right. And who is &s;o capable of being my judge, or who &s;o anxious I &s;hould not err, as my dear Loui&s;a, my friend, my &s;i&s;ter?</P>

<P>OH, Fairfax, if my choler ro&s;e when la&s;t I wrote, where &s;hall I now find words hot enough to paint the phren&s;y of my &s;oul?&mdash;How could I rage and rave!&mdash;Is it come to this?&mdash;So bare|faced!&mdash;So fearle&s;s!&mdash;So unblu&s;hingly braved!&mdash;</P>

<P>And after this will I blench? Will I recant the denunciations which legiti|mate vengeance has pronounced?&mdash;</P>
<P>Fairfax&mdash;I am not certain that I do not hate her!&mdash;No!&mdash;Angelic &s;orce|re&s;s!&mdash;It is not hatred, neither&mdash;But it is a tumult, a congregate anarchy of feelings which I cannot unravel; except that the fir&s;t feature of them is re|venge!&mdash;Rou&s;ed and in&s;ulted as I am, not all her blandi&s;hments can dazzle, di|vert, or melt me!

this &s;upreme of plea&s;ures, divine vengeance! Yes, anger mu&s;t be bri|dled: it has now a &s;econd time made me tread backward more than all the &s;teps I had taken in advance. My brain is la|bouring for &s;ome certain and uniform plan, but is at pre&s;ent &s;o di&s;turbed that thought can pre&s;erve no &s;ettled train.</P>
<P>Previous to this &s;econd childi&s;h over|flow of pa&s;&s;ion [for if I would &s;ucceed childi&s;h it is] I had played a ma&s;ter &s;troke, in which indeed I mu&s;t own pa&s;&s;ion was for once my be&s;t ally. With mo&s;t ardent importunity, I with great difficulty wre&s;ted a promi&s;e from her to be mine. The&s;e romancers, Fair|fax, hold love promi&s;es to be binding and &s;acred. And this obtained I thought a fair foundation for my fabric.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">
The current of my thoughts is now wholly turned to this &s;ubject. A thou|&s;and manoeuvres crowding pre&s;ent them|&s;elves; nor can I &s;ay how many mu&s;t be employed. I have generally found my brain rich in expedients, and I think it will not fail me now. I recollect hav|ing mentioned the maid, Laura: &s;he is &s;ecured, and has been for &s;ome time pa&s;t. The fondne&s;s of the fool with one le&s;s expert would be dangerous; but I have taught her to rail at me occa&s;ionally to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and to prai&s;e the favo|rite, who has never lately been any great favorite with her, having as I gue&s;s over|looked her when &s;he had kinder inclina|tions. She was tickled with the contri|vance, which promi&s;ed to &s;ecure her &s;o well from the &s;u&s;picion of her mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="205" REF="206">
and &s;he acts her part tolerably. In fact her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;eems a being without &s;u&s;pi|cion, &s;uperior to it, and holding it in contempt&mdash;So much the better!</P>
<P>This fellow, this king of the cucum|ber-beds mu&s;t be removed. I know not yet the means, but they mu&s;t be found. Pre&s;ent he is dangerous; ab&s;ent he may perhaps be taught to act his part with &s;afety and effect. My ideas are not yet methodi&s;ed, but I have a confu&s;ed fore|&s;ight of various modes by which this and much more may and mu&s;t be accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But no common efforts can be &s;ucce&s;s|ful&mdash;Deep&mdash;Deep mu&s;t be the plot by which &s;he is to be over-reached, the pit into which &s;he mu&s;t fall: and deep it therefore &s;hall be. There is no art I

<P>WHEN la&s;t my Loui&s;a heard from me, my mind was depre&s;&s;ed. I almo&s;t de&s;paired of the great ta&s;k I had under|taken. I had likewi&s;e an immediate duty, a di&s;burthening of my &s;oul, a kind of confe&s;&s;ion of facts to make, from which education has fal&s;ely accu&s;tomed us to
<PB N="213" REF="214">
&s;hrink with pain, and my &s;pirits were overclouded. This rigorous duty is performed; hope again begins to bright|en, and my ea&s;ed heart now feels more light and cheerful.</P>
<P>Not but it &s;till is tremulous with the &s;en&s;ations by which it has ju&s;t been thrilled. I &s;eem to have ri&s;en from one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and I believe I may add awful &s;cenes, in which I have ever been engaged. The rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul have been &s;earched; that no re|tro&s;pective accu&s;ation of want of ab&s;o|lute and perfect candour might, as of late it too often has done, ri&s;e to a&s;&s;ault me.</P>
<P>I found Clifton in the parlour. His look was more compo&s;ed, more compla|cent, and remarkably more thoughtful
<PB N="214" REF="215">
than it had lately been. I began with &s;tating that the feelings of my heart re|quired every act, every thought of mine, that had any relation whatever to him, &s;hould be fully and explicitly known. I conjured him to have the goodne&s;s to determine not to interrupt me; that I might perform this office, clear my con|&s;cience, and &s;hew my heart unveiled, un|di&s;gui&s;ed, exactly as it was; and that he might at once reject it, if it were either unworthy his acceptance or incompati|ble with his principles.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed compliance and kept his word. I never knew him a li&s;tener &s;o long, or with &s;uch mute patience. I had as I may &s;ay &s;tudied the di&s;cour&s;e which I made to him, and which I thus began.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
It will not be my intention, Mr. Clif|ton, in what I am going to &s;ay, to ap|pear better or wor&s;e than I am. Should I be partial to my&s;elf, I wi&s;h you to de|tect me. There is nothing I &s;o much de&s;ire as a knowledge of my own fail|ings. This knowledge, were it truly at|tained, would make the wor&s;t of us an|gels. Our prejudices, our pa&s;&s;ions, and our ignorance alone deceive us, and per|&s;uade us that wrong is right.</P>
<P>I have before acquainted you of the project of Mrs. Clifton and Sir Arthur, for our union. I have told you of the unfeigned friend&s;hip, the high admira|tion, and the unbounded love I have for your &s;i&s;ter: or in other words for her virtues. A &s;hort acquaintance &s;hewed me that your mind had all the capacity
<PB N="216" REF="217">
to which the mo&s;t ardent of my hopes a&s;pired. It had indeed propen&s;ities, pa&s;&s;ions, and habits, which I thought errors; but not incurable. The meane&s;t of us have our duties to fulfil, which are in proportion to our opportunities, and our power. I imagined that a duty of a high but po&s;&s;ible nature pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and called upon me for performance.</P>
<P>You no doubt will &s;mile at my vani|ty, but I mu&s;t be &s;incere. By in&s;truc|tion, by conver&s;ation, and by other acci|dents, it appeared to me that I had been taught &s;ome high and beneficial truths and principles; which you, by con|trary in&s;truction, conver&s;ation, and acci|dents, had not attained. Convinced that truth is irre&s;i&s;tible, I tru&s;ted in the power of the&s;e truths rather than of my|&s;elf,
<PB N="217" REF="218">
and &s;aid here is a mind to which I am under every moral obligation to im|part them, becau&s;e I perceive it equal to their reception. The project therefore of our friends was combined with the&s;e circum&s;tances, which induced me wil|lingly to join their plan; and to call my friend &s;i&s;ter was an additional and de|lightful motive. It appeared like &s;trength|ening tho&s;e bonds between us which I be|lieve no human force can break.</P>
<P>An ob&s;tacle or rather the appearance of an ob&s;tacle &s;omewhat unexpectedly aro&s;e. From my childhood I had been in part a witne&s;s of the ri&s;ing virtues of young Mr. Henley. Difference of &s;ex, of &s;ituation, and of pur&s;uits, prevented us till lately from being intimate. I had
<PB N="218" REF="219">
been accu&s;tomed to hear him prai&s;ed, but knew not all the eminence with which it was de&s;erved. He was my &s;uppo&s;ed inferior, and it is not very long &s;ince I my&s;elf entertained &s;ome part of that prejudice. I know my&s;elf now not to be his equal.</P>
<P>A recollection of combining circum|&s;tances convinced me that he had for &s;ome time, and before I &s;u&s;pected it, thought on me with partiality. He be|lieves there is great affinity in our minds; he avows it, and with a manly courage becoming his character, which abhors di&s;&s;imulation, has &s;ince confe&s;&s;ed an af|fection for me; nay has affirmed that un|le&s;s I have conceived &s;ome repugnance to him, which I have not nor ever can
<PB N="219" REF="220">
conceive, I ought as a &s;trict act of ju&s;tice to my&s;elf and him to prefer him before any other.</P>
<P>I &s;hould acknowledge the cogency of the rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns, and certainly en|tertain &s;uch a preference, did it not ap|pear to me that there are oppo&s;ing and irreconcileable claims and duties. It is my principle, and perhaps &s;till more &s;trongly his, that neither of us mu&s;t live for our&s;elves, but for &s;ociety. In the ab&s;tract our principle is the &s;ame; but in the application we appear to differ. He thinks that the marriage of two &s;uch people can benefit &s;ociety at large. I am per&s;uaded that the little influence which it would have in the world would be injurious, and in &s;ome &s;ort fatal to the &s;mall circle for which I &s;eem to exi&s;t, and
<PB N="220" REF="221">
over which my feeble influence can ex|tend.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons only, and in com|pliance with what I believe to be the ri|gorous but inflexible injunctions of ju&s;|tice, have I rejected a man whom I cer|tainly do not merit: a man who&s;e bene|volent heart, capacious mind, and ex|traordinary virtues are above my prai&s;e, and I almo&s;t fear beyond my attainment.</P>
<P>My memory will not furni&s;h me with every word and incident that have pa&s;&s;ed between us; and if it would &s;uch repe|tition would be tedious. But I wi&s;h you clearly to under&s;tand that Mr. Hen|ley has made the&s;e declarations to me; that my mode of acting and my rea&s;ons have been &s;uch as I have mentioned; that I am not my&s;elf &s;o perfectly &s;atis|fied
<PB N="221" REF="222">
with the&s;e rea&s;ons but that I &s;ome|times am &s;ubject to recurring doubts; and that I do at pre&s;ent and while I have thought or &s;en&s;e &s;hall continue to ad|mire his genius and his virtue.</P>
<P>If what he has &s;aid or what I have done be offen&s;ive to you, if you cannot think highly of him and innocently of me, if my thoughts concerning him can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;tained with a criminal tinge in your eyes, it becomes you, and I now mo&s;t &s;olemnly call upon you, as a man di&s;daining deceit, at once to &s;ay &s;o, and here to break off all further intercour&s;e. E&s;teem, nay revere him I do and ever mu&s;t; and in&s;tead of being guilty for this, my principles tell me the crime would be to e&s;teem and revere him le&s;s.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t in the frankne&s;s of my heart for
<PB N="222" REF="223">
the proof of it's &s;incerity. My determi|nation is to have a clear and un&s;potted con&s;cience. Purity of mind is a ble&s;|&s;ing beyond all price; and it is that purity only which is genuine or of any value. The circum&s;tance I am going to relate may to you appear &s;trange, and highly reprehen&s;ible&mdash;Be it &s;o&mdash;It mu&s;t be told.</P>
<P>We never had but one conver&s;ation in which the &s;ubject of marriage, as it re|lated to him and me, was directly and fairly debated. He then behaved as he has done always with that &s;incerity, con|&s;i&s;tency, and fortitude, by which he is &s;o peculiarly characteri&s;ed. A conver&s;a|tion &s;o intere&s;ting, in which a man of &s;uch uncommon merit was to be rejected by a woman who cannot deny him to be
<PB N="223" REF="224">
her &s;uperior, could not but awaken all the affections of the heart. I own that mine ached in the di&s;charge of its du|ties, and nothing but the mo&s;t rooted determination to abide by tho&s;e duties could have &s;teeled it to refu&s;al&mdash;It was a cruel fortitude!</P>
<P>But while it ached it overflowed; and to you more e&s;pecially than to any other per&s;on upon earth, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that, at a moment when the feeling of compa&s;&s;ion and the dread of being unju&s;t were excited mo&s;t powerfully in my bo&s;om, paradoxical as it may &s;eem, my zeal to demon&s;trate the integrity and innocence of my mind induced me to&mdash;ki&s;s him!</P>
<P>I &s;carcely can proceed&mdash;There are &s;en&s;ations almo&s;t too &s;trong to be &s;ub|dued
<PB N="224" REF="225">
&mdash;The mind with difficulty can en|dure that mi&s;take, that contortion, which can wre&s;t guilt out of the mo&s;t &s;ublime of its emanations&mdash;However, if it were a crime, of that crime I am guilty&mdash;I pretend not to appear other than I am; and what I am it is nece&s;&s;ary at this mo|ment that you &s;hould know.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation and this incident happened on the day on which you met him in the corridor, coming from my chamber. A day, Mr. Clifton, worthy of your remembrance and of your emu|lation; for it afforded &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of inflexible courage of which man is at pre&s;ent capable. He had been robbed of the hope deare&s;t to his heart, had been rejected by the wo|man he had cho&s;en to be the friend and
<PB N="225" REF="226">
companion of his life, had been en|joined the ta&s;k of doing all po&s;&s;ible good to his rival, which he had uncon|ditionally promi&s;ed, and he left her to&mdash;receive a blow from this rival's hand!</P>
<P>Far be it from me, Mr. Clifton, to wi&s;h to give you pain, or in&s;ult your feelings!&mdash;Oh no!&mdash;I retrace the picture only becau&s;e I think it one of the mo&s;t in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons, for private life, the &s;tores of memory can &s;upply.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t further inform you that but a few days ago I que&s;tioned him, whether he had not changed his opinion con|cerning me; hoping that after mature reflection he might have thought, as I do, that to refu&s;e him was a duty. But he per&s;i&s;ts in believing it to be an
<PB N="226" REF="227">
error. He does not however obtrude his thoughts upon me: on the &s;ubject of love an anchorite could not be more &s;ilent, or a brother more delicate. That one conver&s;ation excepted, he has made no further attempts. A few words were indirectly &s;aid, when, as I have ju&s;t told you, I que&s;tioned him; but they were excited by me.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ong, at which you have la&s;t taken offence, its brief hi&s;tory is that it was written, or at lea&s;t fir&s;t &s;een by me, &s;oon after our arrival in France. I found it on my mu&s;ic|de&s;k; and I dare affirm it had been left there by mi&s;take, not de&s;ign. I &s;up|po&s;ed it to be his from the hand-writ|ing; and I &s;et it becau&s;e it affected me.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228">
The day on which you found me &s;inging it to him was the fir&s;t on which it was ever mentioned by him to me; and then, after he had been pre&s;&s;ed by Sir Arthur to know how he could &s;erve him, a copy of it was begged from me as the only favour the family could be|&s;tow!&mdash;He has done us many fa|vours! Favours which we &s;hall never have an opportunity to repay! Though my hands are impotent, ere my thoughts can be re&s;trained from being ju&s;t to his worth I mu&s;t be convinced there is guilt in tho&s;e thoughts.</P>
<P>How to addre&s;s my&s;elf now per&s;on|ally to you, Mr. Clifton, I &s;carcely know. The world perhaps would call my views extravagant, my preten&s;ions impertinent, and my plan ab&s;urd.&mdash;The world
<PB N="228" REF="229">
mu&s;t do its will&mdash;In the progre&s;s to|ward truth, I have pre&s;umed to think you &s;everal &s;teps behind me. I have propo&s;ed to my&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort to be your in&s;tructre&s;s. I have repeated my plan to the per&s;on whom you perhaps may con&s;ider as your rival; I have re|quired his aid, and have avowed that I think him very con&s;iderably your &s;upe|rior. Each and all of the&s;e may be and I &s;uppo&s;e are offen&s;ive; but the pro|ceedings of rectitude never can be dark, hidden, and in&s;idious. When I have &s;aid all that I think of you I &s;hould hope you will be more inclined to believe me equitable.</P>
<P>There are many leading principles in which we differ; and concerning which till we agree to proceed to marriage
<PB N="229" REF="230">
would be culpable. The&s;e you were at fir&s;t eager to examine; but finding the &s;ide you took not &s;o clear and well-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed as you had imagined, di&s;plea&s;ed by contradiction, and, in the &s;pirit of that gallantry which you profe&s;s to ad|mire, being willing to appear complai|&s;ant to the female to whom you pay your addre&s;&s;es, you have lately declined di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. You think no doubt that the lover ought to yield, and the hu&s;band to command; both of which I deny. Hu&s;band, wife, or lover, &s;hould all be under the command of rea&s;on; other commands are tyranny. Rea&s;on and not relation&s;hip alone can give autho|rity.</P>
<P>You think that the claims of birth to &s;uperiority are legitimate: I hold them
<PB N="230" REF="231">
to be u&s;urpations. I deem &s;ociety, and you &s;elf, to be the fir&s;t of claimants. Duels with you are duties, with me crimes. Suicide you allow to be gene|rally an act of in&s;anity, but &s;ometimes of virtue. I affirm that no one, who is not utterly u&s;ele&s;s in &s;ociety, or who cannot by dying be of greater u&s;e than by living, can have a right over his own life: and of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a being I doubt. You maintain that what you po&s;&s;e&s;s is your own: I affirm it is the property of him who wants it mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are e&s;&s;ential differences. Nor are the&s;e all, but perhaps they are more than &s;ufficient to end the alliance we were &s;eeking.</P>
<P>Not that I de&s;ire to end it&mdash;Far, far the rever&s;e!&mdash;You, Mr. Clifton, are &s;o
<PB N="231" REF="232">
highly gifted, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the rank of intellect, and have a mind of &s;uch potency, that to behold its powers employed in the cau&s;e of truth, to be my&s;elf in&s;trumental in a work &s;o worthy, and afterward to become the fa&s;t and deare&s;t friend of &s;uch a mind is a pro|gre&s;&s;ion &s;o delightful, &s;o &s;educing, that for a time I laboured to per&s;uade my&s;elf of its po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The&s;e hopes begin to fade; and, did you know how much this circum&s;tance afflicts me, you would at lea&s;t ab&s;olve me from all charge of indifference.</P>
<P>Habits and prejudices which are &s;anc|tioned by the general practice, and even by numbers who are in many re&s;pects eminently wi&s;e and virtuous, are too &s;tubborn to be overcome by the impo|tent
<PB N="232" REF="233">
arguments of a young female; with whom men are much more prone to trifle, toy, and divert them&s;elves, than to enquire into practical and ab&s;tract truth. In the &s;torm of the pa&s;&s;ions, a voice &s;o weak would not be heard.</P>
<P>That all the&s;e impediments &s;hould be removed I begin to believe but little probable; and, till they are removed, as we are we mu&s;t remain.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles to marriage are indeed &s;o numerous that I perceive calculation to be very much in favour of celibacy: I mean re&s;pecting my&s;elf. I a&s;k not riches; but of wealth of mind my ex|pectations by &s;ome would be called ex|travagant. Yet lower the&s;e expectations I cannot; for that would be to relax in principle.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">
I ended; and your brother &s;till &s;at pa|tient and willing to li&s;ten, had I de&s;ired to continue. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, he replied&mdash;The profound attention I have paid, madam, will I hope convince you I have not been an idle li&s;tener. Your words, or at lea&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance of them, have &s;unk deep in my heart. Your de&s;ire that I &s;hould remember them &s;carcely can equal mine. To me, ma|dam, they are &s;o important that the moment I return home, confident as I u&s;ually am of my memory, I will not tru&s;t it now, but commit them to writ|ing.</P>
<P>What your motives are for this un|u&s;ual care, or whether you do or do not feel your&s;elf offended, Mr. Clifton, it is not po&s;&s;ible for me to divine: but, as I
<PB N="234" REF="235">
think it alike unju&s;t to conceal what I have done or what I have &s;aid, however mi&s;taken my words or actions may have been, I will &s;pare you the trouble of writing, if you think proper, and &s;end you a tolerably correct tran&s;cript of my thoughts tomorrow morning. I can ea&s;ily repeat them, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome me|morandums that I have already made, and by the &s;trength of my recollection and my feelings, which I think are in no danger of a &s;udden decay.</P>
<P>You will infinitely oblige me, madam, and I will endeavour to profit by the favour. My mind is at pre&s;ent as much awake to the &s;ubject as yours&mdash;I hope you are not unwilling to conver&s;e with me on the topics on which we may hap|pen to differ?</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">
Unwilling?&mdash;Oh no!&mdash;It was your unwillingne&s;s that led me almo&s;t to de|&s;pair&mdash;But are you in earne&s;t?&mdash;Truly and &s;incerely in earne&s;t?</P>
<P>In earne&s;t, madam: truly and &s;in|cerely in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>And will you really reflect, &s;eriou&s;ly, deeply, on the &s;ubject in que&s;tion?</P>
<P>As deeply, madam, as you your&s;elf could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton, your pre&s;ent tone and manner rejoice me!&mdash;You half revive my hopes!&mdash;But let me conjure you to be &s;incere with your own heart. Exa|mine every thing I have &s;aid; every thing; e&s;pecially what relates to Frank Henley. All that I have ob&s;erved of your temper, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, obliges me thus &s;eriou&s;ly to warn you.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="237">
Fear not, madam; I will obey your injunctions. I will examine with all the &s;everity you could wi&s;h&mdash;The cup may have its bitters, but its contents mu&s;t be &s;wallowed&mdash;You will not judge ill of me, madam, for my frankne&s;s?</P>
<P>Oh no! Be frank, be true, be wor|thy of your&s;elf!</P>
<P>Such as you would have me, madam, I mu&s;t become&mdash;All I reque&s;t is that you would aid me in the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>And are you indeed as determined as you &s;eem to be?</P>
<P>I am, madam. [I never before, Lou|i&s;a, &s;aw your brother look or &s;peak with &s;uch firmne&s;s.] You have been kindly plea&s;ed to &s;ay you once pre&s;cribed it as a duty to your&s;elf to teach, or attempt to teach me your principles.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
Not mine, but the principles of truth. Cool and fair enquiry is all I wi&s;h. Should any of your principles be better founded than mine, I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy to become your &s;cholar. I am aware how impo&s;&s;ible it is that any two people &s;hould think exactly alike on any one &s;ubject, much le&s;s on all; but on certain great leading points, were you and I to continue as oppo&s;ite as we are, and were we to marry, felicity could not be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Let us hope, madam, it is po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould make a marriage of opinions, which you think as nece&s;&s;ary as of per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Quite!&mdash;Quite!&mdash;Let me conjure you however not to deceive your&s;elf! Pretend to no conviction you do not
<PB N="238" REF="239">
feel; nor degrade the hone&s;t &s;incerity of your heart by any unworthy indulgence of de&s;ire!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Here, Loui&s;a, our conver&s;ation ended. Company came in, and the cu&s;tomary occupations of the day took place. But it is with heartfelt plea&s;ure I add that your brother behaved as if he had for|gotten his former character, and was at la&s;t firmly re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume a new one. I have often endeavoured to encourage hope, but never before felt it in any|thing like the &s;ame degree. He cannot but be in earne&s;t; his determination for the fir&s;t time to commit all I had &s;aid to writing is an indubitable proof!&mdash;May the &s;ame propen&s;ities continue and in|crea&s;e!
<PB N="239" REF="240">
&mdash;"He &s;hall not die" will again be the burthen of my &s;ong!&mdash;What a noble mind might his become!&mdash;Might?&mdash;Let us once more be bold and &s;ay will!&mdash;Oh that to do were as ea&s;y as to &s;ay!</P>
