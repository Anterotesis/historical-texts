<P>MOST of the&s;e ESSAYS were wrote with a View of being publi&s;h'd as WEEKLY-PAPERS, and were in|tended to comprehend the De|&s;igns both of the SPECTATORS and CRAFTSMEN. But having dropt that Undertaking, partly from LAZINESS, partly from WANT of LEISURE, and being willing to make Trial of my Ta|lents for Writing, before I ven|tur'd upon any more &s;erious Compo&s;itions, I was induced to commit the&s;e Trifles to the

Judgment of the Public. Like mo&s;t new Authors, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I feel &s;ome Anxiety con|cerning the Succe&s;s of my Work: But one Thing makes me more &s;ecure; That the READER may condemn my Abilities, but mu&s;t approve of my Moderation and Impartiality in my Method of handling POLITICAL SUBJECTS: And as long as my Moral Cha|racter is in Safety, I can, with le&s;s Anxiety, abandon my Lear|ning and Capacity to the mo&s;t &s;evere Cen&s;ure and Examination. Public Spirit, methinks, &s;hou'd engage us to love the Public, and to bear an equal Affection to all our Country-Men; not to hate one Half of them, under Pretext of loving the Whole.

<HEAD>ESSAY I. Of the DELICACY of TASTE and PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a certain <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion,</HI> to which &s;ome People are &s;ubject, that makes them extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible to all the Accidents of Life, and gives them a lively Joy upon every pro&s;pe|rous Event, as well as a piercing Grief, when they meet with Cro&s;&s;es and Adver&s;ity. Fa|vours and Good-offices ea&s;ily engage their Friend&s;hip; while the &s;malle&s;t Injury pro|vokes their Re&s;entment. Any Honour or Mark of Di&s;tinction elevates them above Mea|&s;ure; but they are as &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with Contempt. People of this Character have, no doubt, much more lively Enjoyments, as well as more pungent Sorrows, than Men of
<PB N="2" REF="8">
more cool and &s;edate Tempers: But, I be|lieve, when every Thing is balanc'd, there is no one, that wou'd not rather chu&s;e to be of the latter Character, were he entirely Ma&s;ter of his own Di&s;po&s;ition. Good or ill Fortune is very little at our own Di&s;po&s;al: And when a Per&s;on, that has this Sen&s;ibility of Temper, meets with any Misfortune, his Sorrow or Re|&s;entment takes intire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and deprives him of all Reli&s;h in the common Oc|currences of Life, the right Enjoyment of which forms the greate&s;t Part of our Happi|ne&s;s. Great Plea&s;ures are much le&s;s frequent than great Pains; &s;o that a &s;en&s;ible Temper mu&s;t meet with fewer Trials in the former Way than in the latter. Not to mention, that Men of &s;uch lively pa&s;&s;ions are apt to be tran|&s;ported beyond all Bounds of Prudence and Di&s;cretion, and take fal&s;e Steps in the Con|duct of Life, which are often irretrievable.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> ob&s;ervable in &s;ome Men, which very much re&s;embles this <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and produces the &s;ame Sen&s;ibility to Beauty and Deformity of every Kind, as that does to Pro&s;perity and Ad|ver&s;ity, Obligations and Injuries. When you
<PB N="3" REF="9">
pre&s;ent a Poem or a Picture to a Man po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Talent, the Delicacy of his Feeling or Sentiments makes him be touched very &s;en&s;i|bly by every Part of it; nor are the ma&s;terly Strokes perceived with a more exqui&s;ite Re|li&s;h and Satisfaction, than the Negligences or Ab&s;urdities with Di&s;gu&s;t and Unea&s;ine&s;s. A polite and judicious Conver&s;ation affords him the highe&s;t Entertainment. Rudene&s;s or Im|pertinence is as great a Puni&s;hment to him. In &s;hort, Delicacy of Ta&s;te has the &s;ame Effect as Delicacy of Pa&s;&s;ion: It enlarges the Sphere both of our Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery, and makes us &s;en&s;ible of Pains, as well as Plea&s;ures, that e&s;cape the re&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, however, there is no one, who will not agree with me, that notwith&s;tanding this Re&s;emblance, a Delicacy of Ta&s;te is as much to be de&s;ir'd and cultivated as a Delica|cy of Pa&s;&s;ion is to be lamented, and to be remedied, if po&s;&s;ible. The good or ill Acci|dents of Life are very little at our Di&s;po&s;al: But we are pretty much Ma&s;ters what Books we &s;hall read, what Diver&s;ions we &s;hall par|take of, and what Company we &s;hall keep. The ancient Philo&s;ophers endeavour'd to ren|der
<PB N="4" REF="10">
Happine&s;s intirely independent of every Thing external. That is impo&s;&s;ible to be <HI>at|tain'd:</HI> But every wi&s;e Man will endeavour to place his Happine&s;s on &s;uch Objects as depend mo&s;t upon him&s;elf: And <HI>that</HI> is not to be <HI>at|tain'd</HI> &s;o much by any other Means as by this Delicacy of Sentiment. When a Man is po&s;|&s;e&s;t of that Talent, he is more happy by what plea&s;es his Ta&s;te than by what gratifies his Appetites, and receives more Enjoyment from a Poem or a Piece of Rea&s;oning than the mo&s;t expen&s;ive Luxury can afford.</P>
<P>HOW far the Delicacy of Ta&s;te and that of Pa&s;&s;ion are connected together in the original Frame of the Mind, it is hard to determine. To me there appears to be a very con&s;iderable Connexion betwixt them. For we may ob|&s;erve, that Women, who have more delicate Pa&s;&s;ions than Men, have al&s;o a more delicate Ta&s;te of the Ornaments of Life, of Dre&s;s, E|quipage, and the ordinary Decencies of Beha|viour. Any Excellency in the&s;e hits their Ta&s;te much &s;ooner than Ours; and when you plea&s;e their Ta&s;te, you &s;oon engage their Affections.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">
BUT whatever Connexion there may be ori|ginally betwixt the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions, I am per&s;ua|ded, that nothing is &s;o proper to cure us of this Delicacy of Pa&s;&s;ion as the cultivating of that higher and more refined Ta&s;te, which enables us to judge of the Characters of Men, of Com|po&s;itions of Genius, and of the Productions of the nobler Arts. A greater or le&s;s Reli&s;h of tho&s;e obvious Beauties, that &s;trike the Sen&s;es, depends intirely upon the greater or le&s;s Sen|&s;ibility of the Temper: But with regard to the Liberal Arts, a fine Ta&s;te is really nothing but &s;trong Sen&s;e, or at lea&s;t depends &s;o much up|on it, that they are in&s;eparable. To judge a|right of a Compo&s;ition of Genius, there are &s;o many Views to be taken in, &s;o many Circum|&s;tances to be compared, and &s;uch a Knowledge of human Nature requi&s;ite, that no Man, who is not po&s;&s;e&s;t of the &s;ounde&s;t Judgment, will ever make a tolerable Critic in &s;uch Performan|ces. And this is a new Rea&s;on for cultivating a Reli&s;h in the Liberal Arts. Our Judgment will &s;trengthen by this Exerci&s;e: We &s;hall form truer Notions of Life: Many Things, which rejoice or afflict others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our Attention: And we
<PB N="6" REF="12">
&s;hall lo&s;e by Degrees that Sen&s;ibility and Deli|cacy of Pa&s;&s;ion, which is &s;o incommodious.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps I have gone too far in &s;aying, that a cultivated Ta&s;te for the Liberal Arts ex|tingui&s;hes the Pa&s;&s;ions, and renders us indif|ferent to tho&s;e Objects, which are &s;o fondly pur&s;ued by the re&s;t of Mankind. When I re|flect a little more, I find, that it rather im|proves our Sen&s;ibility for all the tender and agreeable Pa&s;&s;ions; at the &s;ame Time, that it renders the Mind incapable of the rougher and more boi&s;t'rous Emotions.
<Q><L>Ingenuas didici&s;&s;e fideliter artes,</L>
<L>Emollit mores, nec &s;init e&s;&s;e feros.</L></Q></P>
<P>FOR this, I think there may be a&s;&s;igned two very natural Rea&s;ons. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, no|thing is &s;o improving to the Temper as the Study of the Beauties, either of Poetry, Elo|quence, Mu&s;ick, or Painting. They give a certain Elegance of Sentiment, which the re&s;t of Mankind are intire Strangers to. The Emo|tions they excite are &s;oft and tender. They draw the Mind off from the Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Intere&s;t; cheri&s;h Reflection; di&s;po&s;e to Tranquility; and produce an agreeable Melan|choly,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
which, of all Di&s;po&s;itions of the Mind, is the be&s;t &s;uited to Love and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, a Delicacy of Ta&s;te is favourable to Love and Friend&s;hip, by con&s;in|ing our Choice to few People, and making us indifferent to the Company and Conver&s;ation of the greate&s;t Part of Men. You will very &s;eldom find, that mere Men of the World, whatever &s;trong Sen&s;e they may be endowed with, are very nice in di&s;tingui&s;hing of Cha|racters, or in marking tho&s;e in&s;en&s;ible Diffe|rences and Gradations, which make one Man preferable to another. Any one, that has competent Sen&s;e, is &s;ufficient for their Enter|tainment. They talk to him of their Plea&s;ures and Affairs, with the &s;ame Frankne&s;s as they would to any other: And finding many, that are fit to &s;upply his Place, they never feel a|ny Vacancy or Want in his Ab&s;ence. But to make u&s;e of the Allu&s;ion of a famous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;. <HI>Fontenelle,</HI> Pluralit&eacute; des Mondes, <HI>Soir</HI> 6.</NOTE><HI>French</HI> Author: The Judgment may be compared to a Clock or Watch, where the mo&s;t ordinary Machine is &s;ufficient to tell the Hours; but
<PB N="8" REF="14">
the mo&s;t elaborate and artificial only can point out the Minutes and Seconds, and di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;malle&s;t Differences of Time. One that has well dige&s;ted his Knowledge both of Books and Men, has little Enjoyment but in the Com|pany of a few &s;elect Companions. He feels too &s;en&s;ibly, how much all the re&s;t of Man|kind falls &s;hort of the Notions he has entertain|ed. And his Affections being thus confined in a narrow Circle, no Wonder he carries them further, than if they were more gene|ral and undi&s;tingui&s;hed. The Gaiety and Fro|lick of a Bottle-Companion improves with him into a &s;olid Friend&s;hip: And the Ar|dours of a youthful Appetite become an ele|gant Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II. Of the LIBERTY of the PRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more apt to &s;ur|pri&s;e a Foreigner, than the ex|treme Liberty we enjoy in this Country, of communicating whatever we plea&s;e to the Publick, and of openly cen&s;ur|ing every Mea&s;ure which is enter'd into by the King or his Mini&s;ters. If the Admini&s;tra|tion re&s;olve upon War, 'tis affirm'd, that ei|ther wilfully or ignorantly they mi&s;take the Intere&s;t of the Nation, and that Peace, in the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs, is infinitely prefe|rable. If the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;ters be for Peace, our Political Writers breathe nothing but War and Deva&s;tation, and repre&s;ent the pacifick Conduct of the Government as mean and pu&s;illanimous. As this Liberty is not in|dulg'd in any other Government, either Repu|blican
<PB N="10" REF="16">
or Monarchical; in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> no more than in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain;</HI> it may very naturally give Occa&s;ion to the&s;e two Que&s;ti|ons, <HI>How it happens that</HI> Great Britain <HI>enjoys &s;uch a peculiar Privilege?</HI> and, <HI>Whether the unlimited Exerci&s;e of this Liberty be advanta|geous or prejudicial to the Publick?</HI></P>
<P>AS to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Que&s;tion, Why the Laws in|dulge us in &s;uch an extraordinary Liberty? I believe the Rea&s;on may be deriv'd from our mixt Form of Government, which is neither wholly Monarchical, nor wholly Republican. 'Twill be found, if I mi&s;take not, to be a true Ob&s;ervation in Politicks, That the two Extremes in Government, of Liberty and Slave|ry, approach neare&s;t to each other; and, that as you depart from the Extremes, and mix a little of Monarchy with Liberty, the Government becomes always the more free; and, on the other Hand, when you mix a lit|tle of Liberty with Monarchy, the Yoke be|comes always the more grievous and intolera|ble. In a Government, &s;uch as that of <HI>France,</HI> which is entirely ab&s;olute, and where Laws, Cu&s;tom, and Religion, all concur to make the People fully &s;atisfi'd with their Condition, the
<PB N="11" REF="17">
Monarch cannot entertain the lea&s;t <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> again&s;t his Subjects, and therefore is apt to in|dulge them in great <HI>Liberties</HI> both of Speech and Action. In a Government altogether Re|publican, &s;uch as <HI>Holland,</HI> where there is no Magi&s;trate &s;o eminent as to give <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> to the State, there is al&s;o no Danger in intru&s;t|ing the Magi&s;trates with very large di&s;cretio|nary Powers; and tho' many Advantages re|&s;ult from &s;uch Powers, in the Pre&s;ervation of Peace and Order; yet they lay a con&s;iderable Re&s;traint on Mens Actions, and make every private Subject pay a great Re&s;pect to the Go|vernment. Thus it is evident, that the two Ex|tremes, of ab&s;olute Monarchy and of a Repu|blic, approach very near to each other in the mo&s;t material Circum&s;tances. In the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the Magi&s;trate has no Jealou&s;y of the People: In the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the People have no Jealou&s;y of the Magi&s;trate: Which want of Jealou&s;y begets a mutual Confidence and Tru&s;t in both Ca&s;es, and produces a Species of Liberty in Monarchies, and of arbitrary Power in Re|publics.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify the other Part of the foregoing Propo&s;ition, that in every Government the
<PB N="12" REF="18">
Means are mo&s;t wide of each other, and that the Mixtures of Monarchy and Liberty render the Yoke either more ea&s;y or more grievous. I mu&s;t take Notice of a Remark of <HI>Tacitus</HI> with regard to the <HI>Romans</HI> under their Emperors, that they neither could bear total Slavery nor total Liberty, <HI>Nec totam &s;ervitutem nec totam libertatem pati po&s;&s;unt.</HI> This Remark a fa|mous Poet has tran&s;lated and applied to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in his admirable De&s;cription of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Policy and happy Government.
<Q><L>Et fit aimer &s;on joug a l'Anglois indompt&eacute;,</L>
<L>Qui ne peut ni &s;ervir, ni vivre en libert&eacute;</L>
<BIBL>HENRIADE, <HI>Liv.</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>ACCORDING to the&s;e Remarks, there|fore, we are to con&s;ider the <HI>Roman</HI> Govern|ment as a Mixture of De&s;poti&s;m and Liberty, where the De&s;poti&s;m prevailed; and the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Government as a Mixture of the &s;ame Kind, but where the Liberty predominates. The Con&s;equences are exactly conformable to the foregoing Ob&s;ervation; and &s;uch as may be expected from tho&s;e mixed Forms of Govern|ment, which beget a mutual Watchfulne&s;s and Jealou&s;y. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were, many
<PB N="13" REF="19">
of them, the mo&s;t frightful Tyrants that ever di&s;graced Humanity; and 'tis evident their Cruelty was chiefly excited by their <HI>Jealou&s;y,</HI> and by their ob&s;erving, that all the great Men of <HI>Rome</HI> bore with Impatience the Dominion of a Family, which, but a little before, was nowi&s;e &s;uperior to their own. On the other Hand, as the Republican Part of the Govern|ment prevails in <HI>England,</HI> tho' with a great Mixture of Monarchy, 'tis obliged, for its own Pre&s;ervation, to maintain a watchful <HI>Jea|lou&s;y</HI> over the Magi&s;trates, to remove all di&s;|cretionary Powers, and to &s;ecure every one's Life and Fortune by general and inflexible Laws. No Action mu&s;t be deemed a Crime but what the Law has plainly determined to be &s;uch: No Crime mu&s;t be imputed to a Man but from a legal Proof before his Judg|es: And even the&s;e Judges mu&s;t be his Fellow|&s;ubjects, who are obliged by their own Intere&s;t to have a watchful Eye over the Encroach|ments and Violence of the Mini&s;ters. From the&s;e Cau&s;es it proceeds, that there is as much Liberty, and even, perhaps, Licence in <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> as there was formerly Slavery and Ty|ranny in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">
THESE Principles account for the great Li|berty of the Pre&s;s in the&s;e Kingdoms, beyond what is indulg'd in any other Government. 'Tis &s;ufficiently known, that de&s;potic Power wou'd &s;oon &s;teal in upon us, were we not ex|treme watchful to prevent its Progre&s;s, and were there not an ea&s;y Method of conveying the Alarum from one End of the Kingdom to the other. The Spirit of the People mu&s;t fre|quently be rouz'd to curb the Ambition of the Court; and the Dread of rouzing this Spi|rit mu&s;t be employ'd to prevent that Ambiti|on. Nothing is &s;o effectual to this Purpo&s;e as the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, by which all the Learning, Wit, and Genius of the Nation may be employ'd on the Side of Liberty, and eve|ry one be animated to its Defence. As long, therefore, as the Republican Part of our Go|vernment can maintain it&s;elf again&s;t the Mo|narchical, it mu&s;t be extreme jealous of the Li|berty of the Pre&s;s, as of the utmo&s;t Impor|tance to its Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the Liberty of the Pre&s;s is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Support of our mixt Go|vernment; this &s;ufficiently decides the &s;econd Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether this Liberty be advantage|ous</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="21">
<HI>or prejudicial;</HI> there being nothing of grea|ter Importance in every State than the Pre&s;er|vation of the ancient Government, e&s;pecially if it be a free one. But I wou'd fain go a Step farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a Liberty is attended with &s;o few Inconveniencies, that it may be claim'd as the common Right of Mankind, and ought to be indulg'd them al|mo&s;t in every Government; except the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, to which indeed it wou'd be fatal. We need not dread from this Liberty any &s;uch ill Con&s;equences as follow'd from the Ha|rangues of the popular Demagogues of <HI>A|thens</HI> and Tribunes of <HI>Rome.</HI> A Man reads a Book or Pamphlet alone and coolly. There is none prefent from whom he can catch the Pa&s;&s;ion by Contagion. He is not hurry'd a|way by the Force and Energy of Action. And &s;hou'd he be wrought up to never &s;o &s;editious a Humour, there is no violent Re&s;olution pre|&s;ented to him, by which he can immediately vent his Pa&s;&s;ion. The Liberty of the Pre&s;s, therefore, however abus'd, can &s;carce ever excite popular Tumults or Rebellion. And as to tho&s;e Murmurs or &s;ecret Di&s;contents it may occa&s;ion, 'tis better they &s;hou'd get Vent in Words, that they may come to the Know|ledge
<PB N="16" REF="22">
of the Magi&s;trate before it be too late, in order to his providing a Remedy again&s;t them. Mankind, 'tis true, have always a grea|ter Propen&s;ion to believe what is &s;aid to the Di&s;advantage of their Governors than the con|trary; but this Inclination is in&s;eparable from them, whether they have Liberty or not. A Whi&s;per may fly as quick, and be as pernici|ous as a Pamphlet. Nay it will be more per|nicious, where Men are not accu&s;tom'd to think freely, or di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt Truth and Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>IT has al&s;o been found, as the Experience of Mankind increa&s;es, that the <HI>People</HI> are no &s;uch dangerous Mon&s;ter as they have been re|pre&s;ented, and that 'tis in every Re&s;pect better to guide them, like rational Creatures, than to lead or drive them, like brute Bea&s;ts. Be|fore the united Provinces &s;et the Example, To|leration was deem'd incompatible with good Government, and 'twas thought impo&s;&s;ible, that a Number of religious Sects cou'd live to|gether in Harmony and Peace, and have all of them an equal Affection to their common Country, and to each other. <HI>England</HI> has &s;et a like Example of civil Liberty; and tho' this
<PB N="17" REF="23">
Liberty &s;eems to occa&s;ion &s;ome mall Ferment at pre&s;ent, it has not as yet produced any per|nicious Effects, and it is to be hoped, that Men, being every Day more accu&s;tomed to the free Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public Affairs, will im|prove in their Judgment of them, and be with greater Difficulty &s;educed by every idle Rumor and popular Clamour</P>
<P>'TIS a very comfortable Reflection to the Lovers of Liberty, that this peculiar Privilege of <HI>Britain</HI> is of a Kind that cannot ea&s;ily be wre&s;ted from us, and mu&s;t la&s;t as long as our Government remains, in any Degree, free and independent. 'Tis &s;eldom, that Liberty of any Kind is lo&s;t all at once. Slavery has &s;o frightful an A&s;pect to Men accu&s;tom'd to Free|dom, that it mu&s;t &s;teal in upon them by De|grees, and mu&s;t di&s;gui&s;e it&s;elf in a thou&s;and Shapes, in ordet to be received. But if the Liberty of the Pre&s;s ever be lo&s;t, it mu&s;t be lo&s;t at once. The general Laws again&s;t Sedi|tion and Libelling are at pre&s;ent as &s;trong as they po&s;&s;ibly can be made. Nothing can im|po&s;e a farther Re&s;traint, but either the clap|ping an IMPRIMATUR upon the Pre&s;s, or the giving very large di&s;cretionary Powers to the

<HEAD>ESSAY III. Of IMPUDENCE and MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE always been of Opinion, that the Complaints again&s;t Providence have been ill-grounded, and that the good or bad Qualities of Men are the Cau&s;es of their good or bad Fortune, more than what is generally imagined. There are, no doubt, In&s;tances to the contrary, and pretty nume|rous ones too; but few, in Compari&s;on of the In&s;tances we have of a right Di&s;tribution of Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity: Nor indeed could it be otherwi&s;e from the common Cour&s;e of human Affairs. To be endowed with a bene|volent Di&s;po&s;ition, and to love others will al|mo&s;t infallibly procure Love and E&s;teem; which is the chief Circum&s;tance in Life, and facilitates every Enterprize and Undertak|ing; be&s;ides the Satisfaction, which imme|diately
<PB N="20" REF="26">
re&s;ults from it. The Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with the other Virtues. Pro&s;perity is naturally, tho' not nece&s;&s;arily attached to Virtue and Merit; as Adver&s;ity is to Vice and Folly.</P>
<P>I MUST, however, confe&s;s, that this Rule admits of an Exception with regard to one moral Quality; and that <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> has a natu|ral Tendency to conceal a Man's Talents, as <HI>Impudence</HI> di&s;plays them to the utmo&s;t, and has been the only Cau&s;e why many have ri|&s;en in the World, under all the Di&s;advanta|ges of low Birth and little Merit. Such In|dolence and Incapacity is there in the Gene|rality of Mankind, that they are apt to receive a Man for whatever he has a Mind to put him&s;elf off for; and admits his over-bearing Airs as Proofs of that Merit, which he a&s;|&s;umes to him&s;elf. A decent A&s;&s;urance &s;eems to be the natural Attendant of Virtue; and few Men can di&s;tingui&s;h Impudence from it: As, on the other Hand, Diffidence, being the natural Re&s;ult of Vice and Folly, has drawn Di&s;grace upon Mode&s;ty, which in outward Appearance &s;o nearly re&s;embles it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">
I WAS lately lamenting to a Friend of mine, who loves a Conceit, that popular Applau&s;e &s;hould be be&s;towed with &s;o little Judgment, and that &s;o many empty forward Coxcombs &s;hould ri&s;e up to a Figure in the World: Up|on which he &s;aid there was nothing &s;urpri&s;ing in the Ca&s;e. <HI>Popular Fame,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is no|thing but Breath or Air; and Air very na|turally pre&s;&s;es into a Vacuum.</HI></P>
<P>As Impudence, tho' really a Vice, has the &s;ame Effects upon a Man's Fortune, as if it were a Virtue; &s;o it is remarkable that it is al|mo&s;t as difficult to be attain'd, and is, in that re&s;pect, di&s;tingui&s;h'd from all the other Vices, which are acquired with little Pains, and con|tinually encrea&s;e upon Indulgence: Many a Man, being &s;en&s;ible that Mode&s;ty is extremely prejudicial to him in the making his Fortune, has re&s;olved to be impudent and to put a bold Face upon the Matter: But 'tis ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch People have &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in the Attempt, but have been obliged to relap&s;e in|to their primitive Mode&s;ty. Nothing carries a Man thro' the World like a true genuine natu|ral Impudence. Its Counterfeit is good for nothing, nor can ever &s;upport it&s;elf. In any
<PB N="22" REF="28">
other Attempt, whatever Faults a Man com|mits and is &s;en&s;ible of, he is &s;o much the near|er his End. But when he endeavours at Impu|dence, if he ever fail'd in the Attempt, the Re|membrance of it will make him blu&s;h, and will infallibly di&s;concert him: After which every Blu&s;h is a Cau&s;e for new Blu&s;hes, 'till he be found out to be an arrant Cheat, and a vain Pretender to Impudence.</P>
<P>IF any thing can give a mode&s;t Man more A&s;&s;urance, it mu&s;t be &s;ome Advantages of For|tune, which Chance procures to him. Riches naturally gain a Man a favourable Reception in the World, and give Merit a double Lu&s;tre, when a Per&s;on is endowed with it; and &s;up|ply its Place, in a great Mea&s;ure, when it is ab|&s;ent. 'Tis wonderful to ob&s;erve what Airs of Superiority Fools and Knaves, with large Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, give them&s;elves above Men of the greate&s;t Merit in Poverty. Nor do the Men of Merit make any &s;trong Oppo&s;ition to the&s;e U&s;urpations; or rather &s;eem to favour them by the Mode&s;ty of their Behaviour. Their Good Sen&s;e and Experience make them diffident of their Judgment, and cau&s;e them to examine every thing with the greate&s;t Accuracy: As
<PB N="23" REF="29">
on the other Hand, the Delicacy of their Sen|timents makes them timorous le&s;t they com|mit Faults, and lo&s;e in the Practice of the World that Integrity of Virtue, of which they are &s;o jealous. To make Wi&s;dom agree with Confidence is as difficult as to reconcile Vice to Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>THESE are the Reflections that have oc|cur'd to me upon this Subject of Impudence and Mode&s;ty; and I hope the Reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee them wrought into the following Allegory.</P>
<P>JUPITER, in the Beginning, joined VIR|TUE, WISDOM and CONFIDENCE toge|ther; and VICE, FOLLY, and DIFFI|DENCE: And in that Society &s;et them upon the Earth. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and &s;aid that <HI>Confidence</HI> was the natural Companion of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and that <HI>Vice</HI> de&s;erved to be attended with <HI>Diffidence,</HI> they had not gone far before Di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e among them. <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> who was the Guide of the one Company, was al|ways accu&s;tomed, before &s;he ventured upon a|ny Road, however beaten, to examine it care|fully;
<PB N="24" REF="30">
to enquire whither it led; what Dan|gers, Difficulties and Hindrances might po&s;&s;ibly or probably occur in it. In the&s;e Deliberations &s;he u&s;ually con&s;um'd &s;ome Time; which Delay was very di&s;plea&s;ing to <HI>Confidence,</HI> who was al|ways inclin'd to hurry on, without much Fore|thought or Deliberation, in the fir&s;t Road he met. <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> were in&s;eparable: But <HI>Confidence</HI> one Day, following his impetuous Nature, advanc'd a con&s;iderable Way before his Guides and Companions; and not feeling any Want of their Company, he never enquir'd after them, nor ever met with them more. In like Manner, the other Society, tho' join'd by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> di&s;agreed and &s;eparated. As <HI>Fol|ly</HI> &s;aw very little Way before her, &s;he had no|thing to determine concerning the Goodne&s;s of Roads, nor cou'd give the Preference to one above another; and this Want of Re&s;olu|tion was encreas'd by <HI>Diffidence,</HI> who with her Doubts and Scruples always retarded the Journey. This was a great Annoyance to <HI>Vice,</HI> who lov'd not to hear of Difficulties and De|lays, and was never &s;atisfy'd without his full Career, in whatever his Inclinations led him to. <HI>Folly,</HI> he knew, tho' &s;he hearken'd to <HI>Diffidence,</HI> wou'd be ea&s;ily manag'd when a|lone;
<PB N="25" REF="31">
and therefore, as a vicious Hor&s;e throws his Rider, he openly beat away this Control|ler of all his Plea&s;ures, and proceeded in his Journey with <HI>Folly,</HI> from whom he is in&s;epa|rable. <HI>Confidence</HI> and <HI>Diffidence</HI> being, after this Manner, both thrown loo&s;e from their re&s;pective Companies, wander'd for &s;ome Time; till at la&s;t Chance led them at the &s;ame Time to one Village. <HI>Confidence</HI> went direc|tly up to the great Hou&s;e, which belong'd to WEALTH, the Lord of the Village; and without &s;taying for a Porter, intruded him&s;elf immediately into the innermo&s;t Apartments, where he found <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> well receiv'd before him. He join'd the Train; recom|mended him&s;elf very quickly to his Landlord; and enter'd into &s;uch Familiarity with <HI>Vice,</HI> that he was enli&s;ted in the &s;ame Company a|long with <HI>Folly.</HI> They were frequent Gue&s;ts of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and from that Moment in&s;epara|ble. <HI>Diffidence,</HI> in the mean Time, not da|ring to approach the Great Hou&s;e, accepted of an Invitation from POVERTY, one of the Tenants; and entering the Cottage, found <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> who being repuls'd by the Land-lord had retir'd thither. <HI>Virtue</HI> took Compa&s;&s;ion of her, and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> found, from
<PB N="26" REF="32">
her Temper, that &s;he wou'd ea&s;ily improve: So they admitted her into their Society. Ac|cordingly, by their Means, &s;he alter'd in a little Time &s;omewhat of her Manner, and be|coming much more amiable and engaging, was now call'd by the Name of MODESTY. As ill Company has a greater Effect than good, <HI>Confidence,</HI> tho' more refractory to Coun&s;el and Example, degenerated &s;o far by the Society of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly,</HI> as to pa&s;s by the Name of IMPUDENCE. Mankind, who &s;aw the&s;e Societies as <HI>Jupiter</HI> fir&s;t join'd them, and knew nothing of the&s;e mutual De&s;ertions, are led into &s;trange Mi&s;takes by tho&s;e Means; and wherever they &s;ee <HI>Impudence,</HI> make ac|count of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and wherever they ob&s;erve <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> call her Attendants <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV. That POLITICS may be reduc'd to a SCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a great Que&s;tion with &s;everal, Whether there be any e&s;&s;ential Difference betwixt one Form of Government and another? and, Whether every Form may not become good or bad, according as it is well or ill admini|&s;tred<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>For Forms of Government let Fools conte&s;t:</L>

Were it once admitted, that all Go|vernments are alike, and that the only Diffe|rence con&s;i&s;ts in the Character and Conduct of the Governors, mo&s;t political Di&s;putes wou'd be at an End, and all <HI>Zeal</HI> for one Con&s;tituti|on above another mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd mere Bi|gotry and Folly. But though I be a profe&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="34">
Friend to <HI>Moderation,</HI> I cannot forbear con|demning this Sentiment, and &s;hould be &s;orry to think, that human Affairs admit of no greater Stability, than what they receive from the ca|&s;ual Humours and Characters of particular Men.</P>
<P>'TIS true, tho&s;e who maintain, that the Goodne&s;s of all Government con&s;i&s;ts in the Goodne&s;s of the Admini&s;tration, may cite ma|ny particular In&s;tances in Hi&s;tory where the very &s;ame Government, in different Hands, varies &s;uddenly into the two oppo&s;ite Extremes of good and bad. Compare the <HI>French</HI> Go|vernment under <HI>Henry</HI> III. and under <HI>Hen|ry</HI> IV. Cruelty, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Levity, Artifice on the Part of the Rulers; Faction, Sediti|on, Treachery, Rebellion, Di&s;loyalty on the Part of the Subjects: The&s;e compo&s;e the Character of the former mi&s;erable Aera. But when the Patriot and heroic Prince, who &s;uc|ceeded, was once firmly &s;eated on the Throne, the Government, the People, every Thing &s;eem'd to be totally chang'd, and all from the Change of the Temper and Sentiments of one &s;ingle Man. An equal Difference of a contra|ry Kind, may be found in comparing the
<PB N="29" REF="35">
Reigns of <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> at lea&s;t with Regard to foreign Affairs; and In&s;tances of this Kind may be multiply'd, almo&s;t without Number, from antient as well as modern Hi|&s;tory.</P>
<P>BUT here I wou'd beg Leave to make a Di|&s;tinction. All ab&s;olute Governments (and &s;uch the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government was, in a great Mea|&s;ure, till the Middle of the la&s;t Century) mu&s;t very much depend on the Admini&s;tration; and this is one of the great Inconveniencies of that Form of Government. But a Republican and free Government wou'd be a mo&s;t glaring Ab&s;urdity, if the particular Checks and Con|trouls, provided by the Con&s;titution, had real|ly no Influence, and made it not the Intere&s;t, even of bad Men, to operate for the public Good. Such is the Intention of the&s;e Forms of Government; and &s;uch is the real Effect, where they are wi&s;ely con&s;tituted: As on the other Hand, they are the Sources of all Di&s;or|der, and of the blacke&s;t Crimes, where either Skill or Hone&s;ty has been wanting in their o|riginal Frame and In&s;titution. So great is the Force of Laws, and of particular Forms of Go|vernment, and &s;o little Dependence have they
<PB N="30" REF="36">
on the Humours and Temper of Men, that Con&s;equences as general and as certain may be deduced from them, on mo&s;t Occa&s;ions, as any which the Mathematical Sciences can afford us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Government gave the whole Legi&s;lative Power to the Commons, without allowing a Negative, either to the Nobility, or Con&s;uls. This unbounded Power the Com|mons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a collective Body, not in a Repre&s;entative. The Con&s;equences were, When the People, by Succe&s;s and Conque&s;t had become very numerous, and had &s;pread them&s;elves to a great Di&s;tance from the Capi|tal, the City-Tribes, tho' the mo&s;t contempti|ble, carried almo&s;t every Vote: They were, therefore, mo&s;t cajol'd by every one who af|fected Popularity: They were &s;upported in I|dlene&s;s by the general Di&s;tribution of Corn, and by particular Bribes, which they received from almo&s;t every Candidate: By this Means they became every Day more licentious, and the <HI>Campus Martius</HI> was a perpetual Scene of Tu|mult and Sedition: Armed Slaves were intro|duced among the&s;e ra&s;cally Citizens; &s;o that the whole Government fell into Anarchy, and the greate&s;t Happine&s;s the <HI>Romans</HI> could
<PB N="31" REF="37">
look for, was the de&s;potic Power of the <HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> Such are the Effects of Democracy without a Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>A NOBILITY may po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole or any Part of the legi&s;lative Power of a State after two different Ways. Either every No|bleman &s;hares the Power as part of the whole Body, or the whole Body enjoys the Power as compo&s;ed of Parts; which have each a di|&s;tinct Power and Authority. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility are an In&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind of Government: The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> of the &s;econd. In the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government the whole Body of Nobility po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the whole Power, and no Nobleman has any Authority, which he re|ceives not from the Whole. In the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Go|vernment every Nobleman, by Means of his Fiefs, has a peculiar hereditary Authority o|ver his Va&s;&s;als, and the whole Body has no Authority but what it receives from the Con|currence of its Parts. The di&s;tinct Operations and Tendencies of the&s;e two Species of Go|vernment might be made mo&s;t apparent even <HI>a priori.</HI> A <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility is infinitely pre|ferable to a <HI>Poli&s;h,</HI> let the Humours and Edu|cation of Men be ever &s;o much vary'd. A
<PB N="32" REF="38">
Nobility, who po&s;&s;e&s;s their Power in com|mon, will pre&s;erve Peace and Order, both among them&s;elves, and their Subjects; and no Member can have Authority enough to controul the Laws for a Moment. They will pre&s;erve their Authority over the People, but without any grievous Tyranny, or any Breach of private Property; becau&s;e &s;uch a tyranni|nical Government is not the Intere&s;t of the whole Body, however it may be the Intere&s;t of &s;ome Individuals. There will be a Di&s;tinc|tion of Rank betwixt the Nobility and People, but this will be the only Di&s;tinction in the State. The whole Nobility will form one Bo|dy, and the whole People another, without any of tho&s;e private Feuds and Animo&s;ities, which &s;pread Ruin and De&s;olation everywhere. 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee the Di&s;advantages of a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility in every one of the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P>'TIS po&s;&s;ible &s;o to con&s;titute a free Govern|ment, as that a &s;ingle Per&s;on, call him Duke, Prince or King, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s a very large Share of the Power, and &s;hall form a proper Bal|lance or Counterpoi&s;e to the other Parts of the Legi&s;lature. This chief Magi&s;trate may be either <HI>elective</HI> or <HI>hereditary;</HI> and tho' the
<PB N="33" REF="39">
former In&s;titution may, to a &s;uperficial View, appear mo&s;t advantageous; yet a more accu|rate In&s;pection will di&s;cover in it greater In|conveniencies than in the latter, and &s;uch as are founded on Cau&s;es and Principles eternal and immutable. The filling of the Throne, in &s;uch a Government, is a Point of too great and too general Intere&s;t not to divide the whole People into Factions: From whence a Civil War, the greate&s;t of Ills, may be appre|hended, almo&s;t with Certainty, upon every Vacancy. The Prince elected mu&s;t be either a <HI>Foreigner</HI> or a <HI>Native:</HI> The former will be ignorant of the People whom he is to govern; &s;u&s;picious of his new Subjects, and &s;u&s;pected by them; giving his Confidence entirely to Strangers, who will have no other Thoughts but of enriching them&s;elves in the quicke&s;t Manner, while their Ma&s;ter's Favour and Au|thority is able to &s;upport them. A Native will carry into the Throne all his private Ani|mo&s;ities and Friend&s;hips, and will never be regarded, in his Elevation, without exciting the Sentiments of Envy in tho&s;e who former|ly con&s;ider'd him as their Equal. Not to men|tion, that a Crown is too high a Reward ever to be given to Merit alone, and will always
<PB N="34" REF="40">
induce the Candidates to employ Force, or Money, or Intrigue, to procure the Votes of the Electors: So that &s;uch a Choice will give no better Chance for a &s;uperior Merit in the Prince, than if the State had tru&s;ted to Birth alone to determine their Sovereign.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be pronounced as an uni|ver&s;al Axiom in Politics, <HI>That an hereditary Prince, a Nobility without Va&s;&s;als, and a Peo|ple voting by their Repre&s;entatives, form the be&s;t</HI> MONARCHY, ARISTOCRACY <HI>and</HI> DEMOCRACY. But in order to prove more fully, that Politics admit of general Truths, which are invariable by the Humour or Edu|cation either of Subject or Sovereign, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve &s;ome other Principles of this Science, which may &s;eem to de&s;erve that Character.</P>
<P>IT may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erv'd, that though free Governments have been commonly the mo&s;t happy for tho&s;e who partake of their Free|dom; yet are they the mo&s;t ruinous and op|pre&s;&s;ive for their Provinces: And this Ob&s;er|vation may, I believe, be fix'd as a Maxim of the kind we are here &s;peaking of. When a
<PB N="35" REF="41">
Monarch extends his Dominions by Conque&s;t, he &s;oon learns to con&s;ider his old and his new Subjects as on the &s;ame Footing; becau&s;e in reality all his Subjects are to him the &s;ame, except the few Friends and Favourites, with whom he is per&s;onally acquainted. He does not, therefore, make any Di&s;tinction be|twixt them in his <HI>general</HI> Laws; and at the &s;ame Time is no le&s;s careful to prevent all <HI>par|ticular</HI> Acts of Oppre&s;&s;ion in the one as in the other. But a free State nece&s;&s;arily makes a great Di&s;tinction, and mu&s;t always do &s;o, 'till Men learn to love their Neighbours as well as them&s;elves. The Conquerors, in &s;uch a Government, are all Legi&s;lators, and will be &s;ure &s;o to contrive Matters, by Re&s;trictions of Trade and by Taxes, as to draw &s;ome private, as well as public, Advantage from their Conque&s;ts. Provincial Governors have al&s;o a better Chance in a Republick, to e|&s;cape with their Plunder, by means of Bri|bery or Intere&s;t; and their Fellow-Citizens, who find their own State to be inriched by the Spoils of their Subject-Provinces, will be the more inclined to tolerate &s;uch Abu&s;es. Not to mention, that 'tis a nece&s;&s;ary Precau|tion in a free State to change the Governors
<PB N="36" REF="42">
frequently; which obliges the&s;e temporary Tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious, that they may accumulate &s;ufficient Wealth be|fore they give place to their Succe&s;&s;ors. What cruel Tyrants were the <HI>Romans</HI> over the World during the Time of their Common-wealth! 'Tis true, they had Laws to prevent Oppre&s;|&s;ion in their Provincial Magi&s;trates; but <HI>Ci|cero</HI> informs us, that the <HI>Romans</HI> could not better con&s;ult the Intere&s;t of the Provinces than by repealing the&s;e very Laws. For, &s;ays he, in that Ca&s;e our Magi&s;trates, having en|tire Impunity, would plunder no more than would &s;atisfy their own Rapaciou&s;ne&s;s: Where|as, at pre&s;ent, they mu&s;t al&s;o &s;atisfy that of their Judges, and of all the great Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> who&s;e Protection they &s;tand in need of. Who can read of the Cruelties and Op|pre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Verres</HI> without Horror and A&s;to|ni&s;hment? And, who is not touched with In|dignation to hear, that after <HI>Cicero</HI> had ex|hau&s;ted on that abandoned Criminal all the Thunders of the mo&s;t divine Eloquence, and had prevailed &s;o far as to get him condemned to the utmo&s;t Extent of the Laws; yet that cruel Tyrant lived peaceably to old Age, in O|pulence and Ea&s;e, and, thirty Years afterward,

was put into the Pro&s;cription by <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> upon account of his exorbitant Wealth, where he fell, along with <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf, and all the mo&s;t virtuous Men of <HI>Rome?</HI> After the Di&s;&s;o|lution of the Common-wealth, the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke became ea&s;ier upon the Provinces, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> informs us; and it may be ob&s;erved, that ma|ny of the wor&s;t Emperors, <HI>Domitian,</HI> for in|&s;tance, were very careful to prevent all Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Provinces. In <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s Time, <HI>Gaul</HI> was e&s;teemed richer than <HI>Italy</HI> it&s;elf: Nor do I find, during the whole Time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Monarchy, that the Empire be|came le&s;s rich or populous in any of its Pro|vinces; though indeed its Valour and military Di&s;cipline were always upon the Decline. If we pa&s;s from antient to modern Times, we &s;hall find the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation to hold true. The Provinces of ob&s;olute Monarchies are al|ways better treated than tho&s;e of free States. Compare the <HI>Pais conquis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and you'll be convinced of this Truth; though this latter Kingdom, being almo&s;t en|tirely peopled from <HI>England,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many Rights and Privileges as &s;hould naturally make it challenge better Treatment than that of a
<PB N="38" REF="44">
conquered Province. <HI>Cor&s;ica</HI> is al&s;o an obvi|ous In&s;tance to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE is an Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> with regard to the Conque&s;ts of <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> which, I think, may be regarded as one of tho&s;e eternal political Truths, which no Time or Accidents can vary. It may &s;eem &s;trange, &s;ays that Politician, that &s;uch &s;udden Conque&s;ts as tho&s;e of <HI>Alexander,</HI> &s;hou'd be po&s;&s;e&s;t &s;o peaceably by his Succe&s;&s;ors, and that the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> during all the Confu&s;ions and civil Wars of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> never made the &s;mal|le&s;t Effort towards the Recovery of their for|mer independent Government. To &s;atisfy us concerning the Cau&s;e of this remarkable E|vent, we may con&s;ider, that a Monarch may govern his Subjects after two different Ways. He may either follow the Maxims of the Ea|&s;tern Princes, and &s;tretch his Power &s;o far as to leave no Di&s;tinction of Ranks among his Subjects, but what proceeds immediately from him&s;elf; no Advantages of Birth; no heredi|tary Honours and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: And, in a Word, no Credit among the People, except from his Commi&s;&s;ion alone.

<P>THOSE who either attack or defend a Mi|ni&s;ter in &s;uch a Government as ours, where the utmo&s;t Liberty is allowed, always carry Matters to Extremes, and exaggerate his Me|rit or Demerit with regard to the Publick.

The Honour and Intere&s;t of the Nation &s;upported abroad, pub|lic Credit maintain'd at home, Per&s;ecution re&s;train'd, Faction &s;ubdu'd; the Merit of all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings is a&s;crib'd &s;olely to the Mini|&s;ter.

mu&s;t be faulty in its original Principles, and the Mini&s;ter cannot con&s;i&s;tently be charg'd with undermining the be&s;t Con&s;titution of the World.

<P>I WOU'D make U&s;e of the &s;ame Topics to moderate the Zeal of tho&s;e who defend the Mini&s;ter.

and a Man &s;hou'd no more be anxi|ous in this Ca&s;e, than a Husband, who had marry'd a Woman from the Stews, &s;hou'd be watchful to prevent her Infidelity. Public Affairs, in &s;uch a Con&s;titution, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily go to Confu&s;ion by whatever Hands they are conducted; and the Zeal of <HI>Patriots</HI> is much le&s;s requi&s;ite in that Ca&s;e than the Pati|ence and Submi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> The Virtue and good Intentions of <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Bru|tus</HI> are highly laudable; But to what Purpo&s;e did their Zeal &s;erve?

<P>I WOU'D not be under&s;tood to mean, that public Affairs de&s;erve no Care and Attention at all.

The <HI>Country Par|ty</HI> might &s;till a&s;&s;ert, that our Con&s;titution, tho' excellent, will admit of Male-admini&s;tration to a certain Degree; and therefore, if the Mini|&s;ter be bad, 'tis proper to oppo&s;e him with a <HI>&s;uitable</HI> Degree of Zeal.

<HEAD>ESSAY V. Of the fir&s;t PRINCIPLES of GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more &s;urpri&s;ing to tho&s;e, who con&s;ider human Affairs with a Philo&s;ophical Eye; than to &s;ee the Ea&s;ine&s;s with which the many are governed by the few, and to ob&s;erve the implicite Submi&s;|&s;ion with which Men re&s;ign their own Senti|ments and Pa&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e of their Rulers. When we enquire by what Means this Wonder is brought about, we &s;hall find, that as FORCE is always on the Side of the Governed, the Governors have nothing to &s;upport them but OPINION. 'Tis therefore, on Opinion only that Government is founded; and this Maxim extends to the mo&s;t de&s;potick and mo&s;t milita|ry Governments, as well as to the mo&s;t free and mo&s;t popular. The <HI>Soldan</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> or
<PB N="50" REF="56">
the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> might drive his harm|le&s;s Subjects, like brute Bea&s;ts, again&s;t their Sentiments and Inclination: But he mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have led his <HI>Mamalukes,</HI> or <HI>Praetorian Bands,</HI> like Men, by their Opinion.</P>
<P>OPINION is of two Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Opinion of INTEREST, and Opinion of RIGHT. By Opinion of Intere&s;t, I chiefly under&s;tand the Sen&s;e of the public Advantage which is reapt from Government; along with the Per&s;wa&s;i|on, that the particular Government, which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd, is equally advantageous with any other that cou'd ea&s;ily be &s;ettled. When this Opinion prevails among the Generality of a State, or among tho&s;e who have the Force in their Hands, it gives great Security to any Government.</P>
<P>RIGHT is of two Kinds, Right to POWER, and Right to PROPERTY. What Prevalence Opinion of the fir&s;t Kind has over Mankind, may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood by ob&s;erving the At|tachment, which all Nations have to their an|tient Government, and even to tho&s;e Names, which have had the Sanction of Antiquity. Antiquity always begets the Opinion of Right;
<PB N="51" REF="57">
and whatever di&s;advantageous Sentiment we may entertain of Mankind, they are always found to be prodigal both of Blood and Trea|&s;ure, in the Maintenance of public Right. This Pa&s;&s;ion we may denominate Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or may give it what Appellation we plea&s;e; but a Politician, who wou'd overlook its Influence on human Affairs, wou'd prove him&s;elf to have but a very limited Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, that the Opi|nion of Right to Property is of the greate&s;t Moment in all Matters of Government. A noted Author has made Property the Founda|tion of all Government; and mo&s;t of our po|litical Writers &s;eem inclin'd to follow him in that Particular. This is carrying the Matter too far; but &s;till it mu&s;t be own'd, that the Opinion of Right to Property has a great In|fluence in this Subject.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e three Opinions, therefore, of Intere&s;t, of Right to Power, and of Right to Property, are all Governments founded, and all Authority of the few over the many. There are indeed other Principles, which add Force to the&s;e, and determine, limit, or alter their
<PB N="52" REF="58">
Operation; &s;uch as <HI>Self-Intere&s;t, Fear,</HI> and <HI>Affection:</HI> But &s;till I a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e other Principles can have no Influence alone, but &s;uppo&s;e the antecedent Influence of tho&s;e Opi|nions above-mention'd. They are, therefore, to be e&s;teem'd the &s;econdary, not the origi|nal Principles of Government.</P>
<P>FOR fir&s;t, as to <HI>Self-Intere&s;t,</HI> by which I mean the Expectation of particular Rewards, di&s;tinct from the general Protection which we receive from Government; 'tis evident, that the Magi&s;trate's Authority mu&s;t be an|tecedently e&s;tabli&s;h'd, or at lea&s;t be hop'd for, in order to produce this Expectation. The Expectation of Reward may augment the Authority with regard to &s;ome particular Per|&s;ons; but can never give Birth to it with re|gard to the Public. Men naturally look for the greate&s;t Favours from their Friends and Acquaintance; and therefore, the Hopes of any con&s;iderable Number of the State, wou'd ne|ver center in any particular Set of Men, if the&s;e Men had no other Title to Magi&s;tracy, and had no Influence over the Opinions of Man|kind. The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation may be extend|ed to the other two Principles of <HI>Fear</HI> and
<PB N="53" REF="59">
<HI>Affection.</HI> No Man wou'd have any Rea&s;on to <HI>fear</HI> the Fury of a Tyrant, if he had no Authority over any but from Fear; &s;ince, as a &s;ingle Man, his bodily Force can reach but a &s;mall Way, and whatever Power he has be|yond, mu&s;t be founded either on our own Opinion, or on the pre&s;um'd Opinion of o|thers. And tho' <HI>Affection</HI> to Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue in a <HI>Sovereign</HI> extends very far, and has great Influence; yet he mu&s;t be antecedently &s;uppos'd to be inve&s;ted with a publick Charac|ter, otherwi&s;e the public E&s;teem will &s;erve him in no Stead, nor will his Virtue have any Influence beyond his private Sphere.</P>
<P>A GOVERNMENT may endure for &s;eve|ral Ages, though the Ballance of Power, and the Ballance of Property do not agree. This chiefly happens, where any Member of the State has acquired a large Share of the Pro|perty; but from the original Con&s;titution of the Government has no Share of the Power. Under what Pretext would any Individual of that Order pretend to intermeddle in public Affairs? As Men are commonly much attacht to their antient Government, it is not to be expected, that the Public would ever favour
<PB N="54" REF="60">
&s;uch U&s;urpations. But where the original Con&s;titution allows any Share of the Power, though &s;mall, to an Order of Men, that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a large Share of Property, 'tis ea&s;y for them gradually to &s;tretch their Authority, and bring the Ballance of Power to coincide with that of Property. This has been the Ca&s;e with the Hou&s;e of Commons in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>MOST Writers, that have treated of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Government, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that as the Hou&s;e of Commons repre&s;ents all the Com|mons of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> &s;o its Weight in the Scale is proportioned to the Property and Power of all whom they repre&s;ent. But this Principle mu&s;t not be received as ab&s;olutely true. For though the People are apt to at|tach them&s;elves more to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons than to any other Member of the Con|&s;titution, that Hou&s;e being cho&s;en by them as their Repre&s;entatives, and as the public Guardians of their Liberty; yet are there In|&s;tances where the Hou&s;e, even when in Op|po&s;ition to the Crown, has not been follow'd by the People; as we may particularly ob|&s;erve in the <HI>Tory</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons in the Reign of King <HI>William.</HI> Were the Members
<PB N="55" REF="61">
of the Hou&s;e obliged to receive In&s;tructions from their Con&s;tituents, like the <HI>Dutch</HI> Depu|ties, this would entirely alter the Ca&s;e; and if &s;uch immen&s;e Power and Riches, as tho&s;e of the whole Commons of <HI>Britain,</HI> were brought into the Scale, 'tis not ea&s;y to con|ceive, that the Crown could either influence that Multitude of People, or with&s;tand that Over-ballance of Property. 'Tis true, the Crown has great Influence over the collective Body of <HI>Britain</HI> in the Elections of Members; but were this Influence, which at pre&s;ent is only exerted once in &s;even Years, to be em|ploy'd in bringing over the People to every Vote, it would &s;oon be wa&s;ted; and no Skill, Popularity or Revenue could &s;upport it. I mu&s;t, therefore, be of Opinion, that an Al|teration in this particular would introduce a total Alteration in our Government, and would &s;oon reduce it to a pure Republic; and per|haps, to a Republic of no inconvenient Form. For though the People collected in a Body, like the <HI>Roman</HI> Tribes, be quite unfit for Go|vernment, yet when di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall Bodies, they are more &s;u&s;ceptible both of Rea&s;on and Order; the Force of popular Currents and Tides is, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, broke; and the
<PB N="56" REF="62">
public Intere&s;t may be pur&s;ued with Method and Con&s;tancy. But 'tis needle&s;s to rea&s;on a|ny farther concerning a Form of Government, which is never likely to have place in <HI>Britain,</HI> and which &s;eems not to be the Aim of any Party among&s;t us. Let us cheri&s;h and improve our antient Government as much as po&s;&s;ible, without encouraging a Pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch dan|gerous Novelties.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this Subject with ob&s;er|ving, that the pre&s;ent political Controver&s;y, with regard to <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> is a very frivo|lous one, and can never be brought to any Deci&s;ion, as it is managed by both Parties. The Country-Party do not pretend, that a Member is ab&s;olutely bound to follow &s;uch In&s;tructions, as an Amba&s;&s;ador or General is confined by his Orders, and that his Vote is not to be received in the Hou&s;e but &s;o far as it is conformable to them. The Court-Party, again, do not pretend, that the Sentiments of the People ought to have no Weight with every Member; much le&s;s that he ought to de&s;pi&s;e the Sentiments of tho&s;e whom he re|pre&s;ents, and with whom he is more particu|larly connected. And if their Sentiments be
<PB N="57" REF="63">
of Weight, why ought they not to expre&s;s the&s;e Sentiments? The Que&s;tion, then, is on|ly concerning the Degrees of Weight, which ought to be plac'd on In&s;tructions. But &s;uch is the Nature of Language, that 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble for it to expre&s;s di&s;tinctly the&s;e different Degrees; and if Men will carry on a Contro|ver&s;y on this Head, it may well happen, that they may differ in their Language, and yet a|gree in their Sentiments; and differ in their Sentiments, and yet agree in their Language. Be&s;ides, how is it po&s;&s;ible to fix the&s;e De|grees, con&s;idering the Variety of Affairs that come before the Hou&s;e, and the Variety of Places, which Members repre&s;ent? Ought the In&s;tructions of <HI>Totne&s;s</HI> to have the &s;ame Weight as tho&s;e of <HI>London?</HI> Or In&s;tructions, with re|gard to the <HI>Convention,</HI> which re&s;pected fo|reign Politics, to have the &s;ame Weight as tho&s;e with regard to the <HI>Exci&s;e,</HI> which re|&s;pected only our dome&s;tic Affairs?</P>

<P>I SHALL tell the Women what it is our Sex complains of mo&s;t in the married State; and if they be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atisfy us in this Particular, all the other Differences will be ea&s;ily accomodated. If I be not mi&s;taken, 'tis their Love of Dominion which is the Ground of the Quarrel; though 'tis very likely, that they will think it an unrea&s;onable Love of it in us, which makes us in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon that Point.

&s;eems to have more Influence on female Minds than this for Power; and there is a remarkable In&s;tance in Hi&s;tory of its pre|vailing above another Pa&s;&s;ion, which is the only one that can be &s;uppo&s;ed a proper Counter-poi&s;e for it. We are told, that all the Women in <HI>Scythia</HI> once con&s;pired a|gain&s;t the Men, and kept the Secret &s;o well, that they executed their De&s;ign before they were &s;u&s;pected. They &s;urpri&s;ed the Men in Drink, or a&s;leep, bound them all fa&s;t in Chains, and having called a &s;olemn Council of the whole Sex, it was debated what Expe|dient &s;hould be u&s;ed to improve the pre&s;ent Advantage, and prevent their falling again in|to Slavery. To kill all the Men did not &s;eem to the Reli&s;h of any Part of the A&s;&s;embly, notwith&s;tanding the Injuries formerly receiv'd; and they were afterwards plea&s;ed to make a great Merit of this Lenity of theirs. It was, therefore, agreed to put out the Eyes of the whole male Sex, and thereby re&s;ign for ever after all the Vanity they could draw from their Beauty, in order to &s;ecure their Autho|rity. We mu&s;t no longer pretend to dre&s;s and Show, &s;ay they; but then we &s;hall be free from Slavery. We &s;hall hear no more tender

Sighs; but in return we &s;hall hear no more imperious Commands. Love mu&s;t for ever leave us; but he will carry Subjection along with him.</P>
<P>'TIS regarded by &s;ome as an unlucky Cir|cum&s;tance, &s;ince the Women were re&s;olved to main the Men, and deprive them of &s;ome of their Sen&s;es, in order to render them hum|ble and dependent, that the Sen&s;e of hearing could not &s;erve their Purpo&s;e, &s;ince 'tis pro|bable the Females would rather have attack'd that than the Sight: And I think it is agreed among the Learned, that, in a married State, 'tis not near &s;o great an Inconvenience to lo&s;e the former Sen&s;e as the latter. However this may be, we are told by modern Anecdotes, that &s;ome of the <HI>Scythian</HI> Women did &s;ecretly &s;pare their Husbands Eyes; pre&s;uming, I &s;up|po&s;e, that they could govern them as well by means of that Sen&s;e as without it. But &s;o in|corrigible and intractable were the&s;e Men, that their Wives were all obliged in a few Years, as their Youth and Beauty decay'd, to imitate the Example of their Si&s;ters; which it was no difficult Matter to do in a State where the female Sex had once got the Superiority.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="68">
I KNOW not if our <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Ladies derive any Thing of this Humour from their <HI>Scythian</HI> An|ce&s;tors; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have often been &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee a Woman very well pleas'd to take a Fool for her Mate, that &s;he might govern with the le&s;s Controul; and cou'd not but think her Sentiments, in this Re&s;pect, &s;till more barbarous than tho&s;e of the <HI>Scythian</HI> Women above-mention'd, as much, as the Eyes of the Under&s;tanding are more valuable than tho&s;e of the Body.</P>
<P>BUT to be ju&s;t, and to lay the Blame more equally, I am afraid it is the Fault of our Sex, if the Women be &s;o fond of Rule, and that if we did not abu&s;e our Authority, they wou'd never think it worth while to di&s;pute it. Ty|rants, we know, produce Rebels; and all Hi|&s;tory informs us, that Rebels, when they pre|vail, are apt to become Tyrants in their Turn. For this Rea&s;on, I cou'd wi&s;h there were no Preten&s;ions to Authority on either Side; but that every Thing was carry'd on with perfect Equality, as betwixt two equal Members of the &s;ame Body.

deliver to them <HI>Plato</HI>'s Account of the Origin of Love and Marriage.</P>
<P>MANKIND, according to that fanciful Phi|lo&s;opher, were not, in their Original, divided into Male and Female, as at pre&s;ent; but each individual Per&s;on was a Compound of both Sexes, and was in him&s;elf both Husband and Wife, melted down into one living Creature. This Union, no Doubt, was very entire, and the Parts very well adju&s;ted together, &s;ince there re&s;ulted a perfect Harmony betwixt the Male and Female, altho' they were oblig'd to be in&s;eparable Companions. And &s;o great was the Harmony and Happine&s;s flowing from it, that the ANDROGYNES (for &s;o <HI>Plato</HI> calls them) or MEN-WOMEN, became in&s;olent upon their Pro&s;perity, and rebell'd again&s;t the Gods. To puni&s;h them for this Temerity, <HI>Jupiter</HI> cou'd contrive no better Expedient, than to divorce the Male-Part from the Female, and make two imperfect Beings of the Compound, which was before &s;o perfect. Hence the O|rigin of Men and Women, as di&s;tinct Crea|tures. But notwith&s;tanding this Divi&s;ion, &s;o lively is our Remembrance of the Happine&s;s we enjoy'd in our primaeval State, that we
<PB N="65" REF="70">
are never at Re&s;t in this Situation; but each of the&s;e Halves is continually &s;earching thro' the whole Species to find the other Half, which was broken from it: And when they meet, they join again with the greate&s;t Fond|ne&s;s and Sympathy. But it often happens, that they are mi&s;taken in this Particular; that they take for their Half what no Way corre&s;|ponds to them; and that the Parts do not meet nor join in with each other, as is u&s;ual in Frac|tures. In this Ca&s;e the Union is &s;oon di&s;|&s;olv'd, and each Part is &s;et loo&s;e again to hunt for its lo&s;t Half, joining it&s;elf to every one it meets by Way of Trial, and enjoying no Re&s;t, till its perfect Sympathy with its Partner &s;hews that it has at la&s;t been &s;ucce&s;sful in its Endea|vours.</P>
<P>WERE I di&s;pos'd to carry on this Fiction of <HI>Plato,</HI> which accounts for the mutual Love betwixt the Sexes in &s;o agreeable a Manner, I wou'd do it by the following Allegory.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Jupiter</HI> had &s;eparated the Male from the Female, and had quell'd their Pride and Ambition by &s;o &s;evere an Operation, he cou'd not but repent him of the Cruelty of his Ven|geance,
<PB N="66" REF="71">
and take Compa&s;&s;ion on poor Mortals, who were now become incapable of any Re|po&s;e or Tranquility. Such Cravings, &s;uch An|xieties, &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ities aro&s;e, as made them cur&s;e their Creation, and think Exi&s;tence it|&s;elf a Puni&s;hment. In vain had they Recour&s;e to every other Occupation and Amu&s;ement. In vain did they &s;eek after every Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e, and every Refinement of Rea&s;on. No|thing cou'd fill that Void, which they felt in their Hearts, or &s;upply the Lo&s;s of their Part|ner, who was &s;o fatally &s;eparated from them. To remedy this Di&s;order, and to be&s;tow &s;ome Comfort, at lea&s;t, on human Race in their forelorn Situation, <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;ent down LOVE and HYMEN to collect the broken Halves of human Kind, and piece them together, in the be&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e two Deities found &s;uch a prompt Di&s;po&s;ition in Mankind to unite again in their primitive State, that they pro|ceeded on their Work with wonderful Succe&s;s for &s;ome Time; till at la&s;t, from many unluc|ky Accidents, Di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e betwixt them. The chief Coun&s;ellor and Favourite of <HI>Hymen</HI> was CARE, who was continually filling his Patron's Head with Pro&s;pects of Futurity; a Settlement, Family, Children, Servants; &s;o
<PB N="67" REF="72">
that little el&s;e was regarded in all the Matches <HI>they</HI> made. On the other Hand, <HI>Love</HI> had cho&s;en PLEASURE for his Favourite, who was as pernicious a Coun&s;ellor as the other, and wou'd never allow <HI>Love</HI> to look beyond the pre&s;ent momentary Gratification, or the &s;ati&s;|fying of the prevailing Inclination. The&s;e two Favourites became, in a little Time, ir|reconcilable Enemies, and made it their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s to undermine each other in all their Undertakings. No &s;ooner had <HI>Love</HI> fixt upon two Halves, which he was cementing toge|ther, and forming to a clo&s;e Union, but <HI>Care</HI> in&s;inuates him&s;elf, and bringing <HI>Hymen</HI> along with him, di&s;&s;olves the Union produc'd by <HI>Love,</HI> and joins each Half to &s;ome other Half, which he had provided for it. To be re|veng'd of this, <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> creeps in upon a Pair already join'd by <HI>Hymen;</HI> and calling <HI>Love</HI> to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they Under-hand contrive to join each Half, by &s;ecret Links, to Halves, which <HI>Hymen</HI> was wholly unacquainted with. It was not long before this Quarrel was felt in its pernicious Con&s;equences; and &s;uch Com|plaints aro&s;e before the Throne of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that he was oblig'd to &s;ummon the offending Parties to appear before him, in order to give
<PB N="68" REF="73">
an Account of their Proceedings. After hea|ring the Pleadings on both Sides, he order'd an immediate Reconcilement betwixt <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hymen,</HI> as the only Expedient for giving Hap|pine&s;s to Mankind: And that he might be &s;ure this Reconcilement &s;hou'd be durable, he laid his &s;trict Injunctions on them never to join any Halves without con&s;ulting their Fa|vourites, <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and obtaining the Con&s;ent of both to the Conjunction. Where this Order is &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, the <HI>Androgyne</HI> is perfectly re&s;tor'd, and human Race enjoy the &s;ame Happine&s;s as in their pri|maeval State.

<HEAD>ESSAY VII. Of the STUDY of HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing I would recom|mend more earne&s;tly to my female Readers than the Study of Hi&s;tory, as an Occupation, of all others, the be&s;t &s;uited both to their Sex and Education; much more in&s;tructive than their ordinary Books of Amu&s;ement, and more entertaining than tho&s;e &s;erious Compo&s;itions, which are u&s;ually to be found in their Clo&s;ets. Among other impor|tant Truths, which they may learn from Hi|&s;tory, they may be informed of two Particu|lars, the Knowledge of which may contribute very much to their Quiet and Repo&s;e; <HI>That</HI> our Sex, as well as theirs, are far from being &s;uch perfect Creatures as they are apt to ima|gine, and, <HI>That</HI> Love is not the only Pa&s;&s;ion, that governs the Male-World, but is often o|vercome
<PB N="70" REF="75">
by Avarice, Ambition, Vanity, and a thou&s;and other Pa&s;&s;ions. Whether they be the fal&s;e Repre&s;entations of Mankind in tho&s;e two Particulars, that endear Romances and Novels &s;o much to the fair Sex, I know not; but mu&s;t confe&s;s I am &s;orry to &s;ee them have &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to Matter of Fact, and &s;uch an Appetite for Fal&s;hood. I remember I was once de&s;ired by a young Beauty, for whom I had &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;end her &s;ome Novels and Romances for her Amu&s;ement in the Coun|try; but was not &s;o ungenerous as to take the Advantage, which &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Read|ing might have given me, being re&s;olved not to make U&s;e of poi&s;oned Arms again&s;t her. I therefore &s;ent her <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives, a&s;&s;uring her at the &s;ame Time, that there was not a Word of Truth in them from Beginning to End. She peru&s;ed them very attentively, 'till &s;he came to the Lives of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e Names &s;he had heard of by Accident: and then returned me the Book, with many Reproaches for deceiving her.</P>
<P>I MAY indeed be told, that the fair Sex have no &s;uch Aver&s;ion to Hi&s;tory, as I have repre&s;ented, provided it be <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Hi&s;tory, and
<PB N="71" REF="76">
contain &s;ome memorable Tran&s;action proper to excite their Curio&s;ity. But as I do not find that Truth, which is the Ba&s;is of Hi&s;tory, is at all regarded in tho&s;e Anecdotes, I cannot ad|mit of this as a Proof of their Pa&s;&s;ion for that Study. However this may be, I &s;ee not why the &s;ame Curio&s;ity might not receive a more proper Direction, and lead them to de&s;ire Ac|counts of tho&s;e who lived in pa&s;t Ages as well as of their Contemporaries. What is it to <HI>Cleora,</HI> whether <HI>Fulvia</HI> entertains a &s;ecret Commerce of Love with <HI>Philander</HI> or not? Has &s;he not equal Rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, when &s;he is informed, (what is whi&s;pered about a|mong Hi&s;torians) that <HI>Cato</HI>'s Si&s;ter had an Intrigue with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and palmed her Son, <HI>Marcus Brutus,</HI> upon her Husband for his own, though in Reality he was her Gallant's? And are not the Loves of <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> or <HI>Julia</HI> as proper Subjects of Di&s;cour&s;e as any Intrigue, that this City has produced of late Years.</P>
<P>BUT I know not whence it comes, that I have been thus &s;educed into a kind of Raillery again&s;t the Ladies: Unle&s;s, perhaps, it pro|ceed from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, that makes the Per&s;on, who is the Favourite of the Com|pany,
<PB N="72" REF="77">
be often the Object of their good-natur'd Je&s;ts and Plea&s;antries. We are plea&s;ed to ad|dre&s;s our &s;elves after any manner to a Per&s;on that is agreeable to us; and at the &s;ame Time pre&s;ume, that nothing will be taken ami&s;s by one who is &s;ecure of the good Opinion and Affections of every one pre&s;ent. I &s;hall now proceed to handle my Subject more &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;hall point out the many Advantages, that flow from the Study of Hi&s;tory, and &s;how how well &s;uited it is to every one, but particularly to tho&s;e who are debarred the &s;everer Studies by the Tenderne&s;s of their Complexion and the Weakne&s;s of their Education. The Advan|tages found in Hi&s;tory &s;eem to be of three kinds, as it amu&s;es the Fancy, as it improves the Under&s;tanding, and as it &s;trengthens Vir|tue.</P>
<P>IN reality, what more agreeable Entertain|ment to the Mind, than to be tran&s;ported in|to the remote&s;t Ages of the World, and to ob|&s;erve human Society in its Infancy, making the fir&s;t faint E&s;&s;ays towards the Arts and Sci|ences: To &s;ee the Policy of Government, and the Civility of Conver&s;ation refining by De|grees, and every thing that is ornamental to
<PB N="73" REF="78">
human Life advancing towards its Perfection. To remark the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, Declen&s;ion and final Extinction of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Empires: The Virtues, which contributed to their Great|ne&s;s; and the Vices, which drew on their Ruin. In &s;hort, to &s;ee all human Race, from the Be|ginning of Time, pa&s;s, as it were, in Review before us, appearing in their true Colours, without any of tho&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es, which, dur|ing their Life-time, &s;o much perplexed the Judgments of the Beholders. What Spectacle can be imagined &s;o magnificent, &s;o various, &s;o intere&s;ting? What Amu&s;ement, either of the Sen&s;es or Imagination, can be compared with it? Shall tho&s;e trifling Pa&s;times, which engro&s;s &s;o much of our Time, be preferr'd as more &s;atisfactory, and more fit to engage our Attention? How perver&s;e mu&s;t that Ta&s;te be, which is capable of &s;o wrong a Choice of Plea|&s;ures?</P>
<P>BUT Hi&s;tory is a mo&s;t improving Part of Knowledge, as well as an agreeable Amu&s;e|ment; and indeed, a great Part of what we commonly call <HI>Erudition,</HI> and value &s;o highly, is nothing but an Acquaintance with hi&s;tori|cal Facts. An exten&s;ive Knowledge of this
<PB N="74" REF="79">
kind belongs to Men of Letters; but I mu&s;t think it an unpardonable Ignorance in Per&s;ons of whatever Sex or Condition, not to be ac|quainted with the Hi&s;tory of their own Coun|try, along with the Hi&s;tories of antient <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> A Woman may behave her&s;elf with good Manners, and have even &s;ome Vi|vacity in her Turn of Wit; but where her Mind is &s;o unfurni&s;h'd, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible her Con|ver&s;ation can afford any Entertainment to Men of Sen&s;e and Reflection.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that Hi&s;tory is not only a va|luable Part of Knowledge, but opens the Door to many other Parts of Knowledge, and af|fords Materials to mo&s;t of the Sciences. And indeed, if we con&s;ider the Shortne&s;s of hu|man Life, and our limited Knowledge even of what pa&s;&s;es in our own Time, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that we &s;hould be for ever Children in Under&s;tanding, were it not for this In|vention, which extends our Experience to all pa&s;t Ages, and to the mo&s;t di&s;tant Nations; making them contribute as much to our Im|provement in Wi&s;dom, as if they had actual|ly lain under our Ob&s;ervation. A Man ac|quainted with Hi&s;tory may, in &s;ome re&s;pect,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
be &s;aid to have lived from the Beginning of the World, and to have been making continu|al Additions to his Stock of Knowledge in e|very Century.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o an Advantage in that Know|ledge, which is acquired by Hi&s;tory, above what is learned by the Practice of the World, that it brings us acquainted with human Af|fairs, without dimini&s;hing in the lea&s;t from the mo&s;t delicate Sentiments of Virtue. And to tell the Truth, I know not any Study or Occupation &s;o unexceptionable as Hi&s;tory in this particular. Poets can paint Virtue in the mo&s;t charming Colours; but as they addre&s;s them&s;elves entirely to the Pa&s;&s;ions, they often become Advocates for Vice. Even Philo&s;o|phers are apt to bewilder them&s;elves in the Subtilty of their Speculations; and we have &s;een &s;ome go &s;o far as to deny the Reality of all moral Di&s;tinctions. But I think it a Re|mark worthy the Attention of the &s;peculative Reader, that the Hi&s;torians have been, almo&s;t without Exception, the true Friends of Virtue, and have always repre&s;ented it in its proper Colours, however they may have erred in their Judgments of particular Per&s;ons. <HI>Machiavel</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="81">
him&s;elf di&s;covers a true Sentiment of Virtue in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Florence.</HI> When he talks as a <HI>Politician,</HI> he con&s;iders Poi&s;oning, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation and Perjury as lawful Arts of Power; but when he &s;peaks as an <HI>Hi&s;torian,</HI> he &s;hows &s;o keen an indignation again&s;t Vice, and &s;o warm an Approbation of Virtue in many Pa&s;|&s;ages, that I could not forbear applying to him that Remark of <HI>Horace,</HI> That if you chace away Nature, though with never &s;o great In|dignity, &s;he will always return upon you. Nor is this Combination of Hi&s;torians in fa|vour of Virtue at all difficult to be accounted for. When a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s enters into Life and Action, he is more apt to con&s;ider the Characters of Men, as they have Relation to his Intere&s;t, than as they &s;tand in them&s;elves; and has his Judgment warped on every Occa|&s;ion by the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion. When a Philo&s;opher contemplates Characters and Man|ners in his Clo&s;et, the general ab&s;tract View of the Objects leaves the Mind &s;o cold and unmoved, that the Sentiments of Nature have no Room to play, and he &s;carce feels the Dif|ference betwixt Vice and Virtue. Hi&s;tory keeps in a ju&s;t Medium betwixt the&s;e Ex|tremes, and places the Objects in their true
<PB N="77" REF="82">
Point of View. The Writers of Hi&s;tory, as well as the Readers, are &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in the Characters and Events, to have a lively Sentiment of Blame or Prai&s;e; and at the &s;ame Time have no particular Intere&s;t or Concern to pervert their Judgment.</P>

IN all Controver&s;ies, we find, without re|garding the Truth or Fal&s;hood on either Side, that tho&s;e who defend the e&s;tabli&s;ht and po|pular Opinions are always mo&s;t dogmatical and imperious in their Stile: While their Ad|ver&s;aries affect a mo&s;t extraordinary Gentle|ne&s;s and Moderation, in order to &s;often, as much as po&s;&s;ible, any Prejudices, that may ly again&s;t them.

<P>I MUST, however, ob&s;erve, that this Re|mark, with regard to the &s;eeming Moderation of the <HI>Court</HI> Party, is entirely confin'd to Con|ver&s;ation, and to Gentlemen, who have been engag'd by Intere&s;t or Inclination in that Par|ty.

<P>I AM led into this Train of Reflection, by con&s;idering &s;ome Papers wrote upon that
<PB N="84" REF="88">
grand Topic of <HI>Court-Influence, and Parlia|mentary Dependence,</HI> where, in my humble Opinion, the Country-Party &s;how too rigid an Inflexibility, and too great a Jealou&s;y of making Conce&s;&s;ions to their Adver&s;aries. Their Rea&s;onings lo&s;e their Force, by being carry'd too far; and the Popularity of their Opinions has &s;educ'd them to neglect, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, their Ju&s;tne&s;s and Solidity. The following Rea&s;oning will, I hope, &s;erve to ju&s;tify me in this Opinion.</P>
<P>POLITICAL Writers have e&s;tabli&s;h'd it as a Maxim, That in contriving any Sy&s;tem of Government, and fixing the &s;everal Checks and Controuls of the Con&s;titution, every Man ought to be &s;uppos'd a <HI>Knave,</HI> and to have no other End, in all his Actions, but private Intere&s;t. By this Intere&s;t we mu&s;t govern him, and by Means of it, make him co-ope|rate to public Good, notwith&s;tanding his in|&s;atiable Avarice and Ambition. Without this, &s;ay they, we &s;hall in vain boa&s;t of the Advan|tages of any Con&s;titution, and &s;hall find, in the End, that we have no Security for our Li|berties or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, except the Good-will
<PB N="85" REF="89">
of our Rulers; that is, we &s;hall have no Secu|rity at all.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore a ju&s;t <HI>political</HI> Maxim, <HI>That every Man mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed a Knave:</HI> Tho' at the &s;ame Time, I mu&s;t own it appears &s;ome|what &s;trange, that a Maxim &s;hould be true in <HI>Politics,</HI> which is fal&s;e in <HI>Fact.</HI> But to &s;atisfy us on this Head, we may con&s;ider, that Men are generally more hone&s;t in their private than in their public Character, and will go greater Lengths to &s;erve a Party than where their own private Intere&s;t is alone concerned. Ho|nour is a great Check upon Mankind: But where a con&s;iderable Body of Men act toge|ther, this Check is, in a great mea&s;ure, re|moved; &s;ince a Man is &s;ure to be approved of by his own Party for what promotes the common Intere&s;t, and &s;oon learns to de&s;pi&s;e the Clamours of his Adver&s;aries. To which we may add, that every Court or Senate is determined by the Majority; &s;o that if Self-Intere&s;t influences only the Majority (as it will always do in the pre&s;ent depraved State of Mankind) the whole Senate follows the Allurements of this &s;eparate Intere&s;t, and acts
<PB N="86" REF="90">
as if it contained not one Member, who had any Regard to public Intere&s;t and Liberty.</P>
<P>WHEN, therefore, there offers to my Cen|&s;ure and Examination any Plan of Govern|ment, real or imaginary, where the Power is di&s;tributed among &s;everal Courts, and &s;everal Orders of Men, I always con&s;ider the private Intere&s;t of each Court, and each Order; and if I find, that, by the artful Divi&s;ion of the Power, the private Intere&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in its Operation, concur with the public, I pronounce that Government to be wi&s;e and happy. If, on the contrary, the private In|tere&s;t of each Order be not check'd, and be not directed to publick Intere&s;t, I &s;hall look for nothing but Faction, Di&s;order, and Tyran|ny from &s;uch a Government. In this Opi|nion I am ju&s;tified by Experience, as well as by the Authority of all Philo&s;ophers and Poli|ticians, both antient and modern.</P>
<P>HOW much, therefore, would it have &s;urpri&s;ed &s;uch a Genius, as <HI>Cicero,</HI> or <HI>Ta|citus,</HI> to have been told, that in a future Age there &s;hould ari&s;e a very regular Sy&s;tem of <HI>mixt</HI> Government, where the Power was
<PB N="87" REF="91">
&s;o di&s;tributed, that one Rank, whenever it plea&s;ed, might &s;wallow up all the re&s;t, and engro&s;s the whole Power of the Con&s;titution. Such a Government, they would have been apt to &s;ay, will not be a mixt Government. For &s;o great is the natural Ambition of Men, that they are never &s;atisfied with Power; and if one Order of Men, by pur&s;uing the Inte|re&s;t of their Order, can u&s;urp upon every o|ther Order, it will certainly do &s;o, and ren|der it&s;elf, as far as po&s;&s;ible, ab&s;olute and un|controulable.</P>
<P>BUT in this Opinion, Experience &s;hows they would have been mi&s;taken. For this is actually the Ca&s;e with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titu|tion. The Share of Power allotted by our Con&s;titution to the Hou&s;e of Commons is &s;o great, that it ab&s;olutely commands all the o|ther Parts of our Government. The King's le|gi&s;lative Power is plainly no proper Check to it. For though the King has a Negative in the pa&s;&s;ing of all Laws; yet this, in Fact, is e&s;teemed of &s;o little Moment, that whatever pa&s;&s;es the two Hou&s;es is always &s;ure to be pa&s;s'd into a Law, and the Royal A&s;&s;ent is lit|tle beter than a mere Form. The principal
<PB N="88" REF="92">
Weight of the Crown lies in the executive Power: But be&s;ides that the executive Power, in every Government, is altogether &s;ubordi|nate to the legi&s;lative; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, the Exerci&s;e of this Power requires an immen&s;e Expence, and the Commons have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the &s;ole Power of di&s;po&s;ing of pub|lic Money: How ea&s;y, therefore, would it be for that Hou&s;e to wre&s;t from the Crown all the&s;e Powers, one after another, by mak|ing every Grant of Money conditional, and choo&s;ing their Time &s;o well, that their Re|fu&s;al of Sub&s;idies &s;hould only di&s;tre&s;s the Go|vernment, without giving foreign Powers a|ny Advantage over us? Did the Hou&s;e of Commons depend in the &s;ame manner on the King, and had none of the Members any Pro|perty but from his Gift, would not he com|mand all their Re&s;olutions, and be from that Moment ab&s;olute? As to the Hou&s;e of Lords, they are a very powerful Support to the Crown as long as they are, in their Turn, &s;upported by it; but both Experience and Rea&s;on &s;how us, that they have no Force nor Authority &s;ufficient to maintain them&s;elves alone, with|out any &s;uch Support.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="93">
How, therefore, &s;hall we &s;olve this Para|dox? And by what Means is this Member of our Con&s;titution confin'd within its proper Limits; &s;ince, from our very Con&s;titution, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have as much Power as it de|mands, and can only be confin'd by it&s;elf? How is this con&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;tant Ex|perience of human Nature? I an&s;wer, that the Intere&s;t of the Body is here re&s;train'd by the Intere&s;t of the Individuals, and that the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;tretches not its Power, becau&s;e &s;uch an U&s;urpation would be contra|ry to the Intere&s;t of the Majority of its Mem|bers. The Crown has &s;o many Offices at its Di&s;po&s;al, that when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted Part of the Hou&s;e, it will always command the Re&s;olutions of the whole; &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to pre&s;erve the antient Con&s;ti|tution from Danger. We may, therefore, give to this Influence what Name we plea&s;e; we may call it by the invidious Appellations of <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Dependence;</HI> but &s;ome Degree and &s;ome Kind of it are in&s;eparable from the very Nature of the Con&s;titution, and nece&s;&s;a|ry to the Pre&s;ervation of our mixt Govern|ment.</P>

INSTEAD then of a&s;&s;erting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Di&s;&s;ertation on Parties, <HI>throughout.</HI></NOTE> ab&s;olutely, that the Dependence of Parliament, in every De|gree, is an Infringement of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, the Country-Party would have done better to have made &s;ome Conce&s;&s;ions to their Adver&s;a|ries, and have only examined what was the pro|per Degree of this Dependence, beyond which it became dangerous to Liberty.

<PB N="91" REF="95">
thought be&s;t to deny, that this Extreme could ever be dangerous to the Con&s;titution, or that the Crown could ever have too little Influence over Members of Parliament.</P>
<P>ALL Que&s;tions concerning the proper Me|dium betwixt any two Extremes are very dif|ficult to be decided; both becau&s;e it is diffi|cult to find <HI>Words</HI> proper to fix this Medium, and becau&s;e the Good and Ill, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, run &s;o gradually into each other, as even to render our <HI>Sentiments</HI> doubtful and uncertain. But there is a peculiar Difficulty in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, which would embarra&s;s the mo&s;t know|ing and mo&s;t impartial Examiner. The Power of the Crown is always lodged in a &s;ingle Per|&s;on, either King or Mini&s;ter; and as this Per|&s;on may have either a greater or le&s;s Degree of Ambition, Capacity, Courage, Popularity or Fortune, the Power, which is too great in one Hand, may become too little in another.
<PB N="92" REF="96">
In pure Republics, where the Power is di&s;tri|buted among &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies or Senates, the Checks and Controuls are more regular in their Operation; becau&s;e the Members of &s;uch numerous A&s;&s;emblies may be pre&s;umed to be always nearly equal in Capacity and Vir|tue; and 'tis only their Number, Riches, or Authority, that enter into Con&s;ideration. But a limited Monarchy admits not of any &s;uch Stability; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign to the Crown &s;uch a determinate Degree of Power, as will, in every Hand, form a proper Coun|ter-ballance to the other Parts of the Con&s;ti|tution.

<HEAD>ESSAY IX. Whether the BRITISH GOVERN|MENT inclines more to ABSO|LUTE MONARCHY, or to a RE|PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>IT affords a violent Prejudice again&s;t al|mo&s;t every Art and Science, that no pru|dent Man, however &s;ure of his Principles, dare prophe&s;y concerning any Event, or foretell the remote Con&s;equences of Things. No Phy&s;ician will venture to pronounce con|cerning the Condition of his Patient a Fort|night or Month after: And &s;till le&s;s dare a Politician foretell the Situation of public Affairs a few Years hence. <HI>Harrington</HI> thought him|&s;elf &s;o &s;ure of his general Principle, <HI>That the Ballance of Power depends on that of Property,</HI> that he ventured to pronounce it impo&s;&s;ible ever to re-e&s;tabli&s;h Monarchy in <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="98">
But his Book was &s;carce publi&s;hed when the King was re&s;tored; and we &s;ee that Monarchy has ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame Foot|ing as before. Notwith&s;tanding of this un|lucky Example, I will venture to examine a very important Que&s;tion, <HI>viz. Whether the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Government inclines more to Ab&s;olute Monarchy, or to a Republic? and in which of the&s;e two Species of Government it will mo&s;t probably terminate?</HI> As there &s;eems not to be any great Danger of a &s;udden Revolution ei|ther Way, I &s;hall at lea&s;t e&s;cape the Shame at|tending my Temerity, if I &s;hould be found to have been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>THOSE who a&s;&s;ert, that the Ballance of our Government inclines towards Ab&s;olute Monarchy may &s;upport their Opinion by the following Rea&s;ons. That Property has a great Influence on Power cannot po&s;&s;ibly be de|nied; but yet the general Maxim, <HI>That the Ballance of the one depends upon the Ballance of the other,</HI> mu&s;t be received with &s;everal Limi|tations. 'Tis evident, that much le&s;s Property in a &s;ingle Hand will be able to counter-bal|lance a greater Property in &s;everal Hands; not only becau&s;e it is difficult to make many
<PB N="95" REF="99">
Per&s;ons combine in the &s;ame Views and Mea|&s;ures; but al&s;o becau&s;e Property, when uni|ted, cau&s;es much greater Dependence, than the &s;ame Property, when di&s;per&s;ed. An hundred Per&s;ons of 1000 a Year apiece, can con&s;ume all their Income, and no Body &s;hall ever be the better for them, except their Ser|vants and Trade&s;men, who ju&s;tly regard their Profits as the Product of their own Labour. But a Man po&s;&s;e&s;t of 100,000 a Year, if he has either any Genero&s;ity, or any Cunning, may create a great Dependence by Obligations, and &s;till a greater by Expectations. Hence we find, that in all free Governments any Subject exor|bitantly rich has always created Jealou&s;y, even tho' his Riches bore no manner of Proportion to the Riches of the State. <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI>'s Fortune, if I remember well, amounted only to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 400,000 l. Sterling.</NOTE>Three Thou&s;and Talents a Year; and yet we find, that though his Genius was nothing extraor|dinary, he was able, by Means of his Riches alone, to counter-ballance, during his Life|time, the Power of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who afterwards became Ma&s;ter of the World. The Wealth of
<PB N="96" REF="100">
the <HI>Medicis</HI> made them Ma&s;ters of <HI>Florence;</HI> tho', 'tis probable, it was very incon&s;iderable, compared to the united Property of that opu|lent Republic.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations are apt to make one entertain a very magnificent Idea of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Spirit and Love of Liberty; &s;ince we cou'd maintain our free Government, during &s;o many Centuries, again&s;t our Sovereigns, who, be&s;ides the Power and Dignity and Ma|je&s;ty of the Crown, have always been po&s;&s;e&s;t of much more Property, than any Subject has ever enjoy'd in any Common-wealth. But it may be &s;aid, that this Spirit, however great, will never be able to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t that immen&s;e Property, which is now lodg'd in the King, and which is &s;till increa&s;ing. Upon a moderate Computation, there are near three Millions at the Di&s;po&s;al of the Crown. The civil Li&s;t amounts to near a Million. The Collection of all Taxes to another Million. And the Employments in the Army and Navy, along with Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Preferments above a third Million; a mon&s;truous Sum, and what may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth Part of the whole Income and La|bour
<PB N="97" REF="101">
of the Kingdom. When we add to this immen&s;e Property, the increa&s;ing Luxury of the Nation, our Pronene&s;s to Corruption, a|long with the great Power and Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Command of &s;uch nu|merous military Forces, there is no one but mu&s;t de&s;pair, without extraordinary Efforts, of being able to &s;upport our free Government much longer under all the&s;e Di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, tho&s;e who maintain, that the Bya&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government leans towards a Republic, may &s;upport their Opi|nion by very &s;pecious Arguments. It may be &s;aid, that though this immen&s;e Property in the Crown, be join'd to the Dignity of fir&s;t Magi&s;trate, and to many other legal Powers and Prerogatives, which &s;hould naturally give it a greater Influence; yet it really becomes le&s;s dangerous to Liberty upon that very Ac|count. Were <HI>Britain</HI> a Republic, and were any private Man po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Revenue, a third, or even a tenth Part as large as that of the Crown, he would very ju&s;tly excite Jea|lou&s;y; becau&s;e he would infallibly have great Authority in the Government: And &s;uch an irregular Authority, not avowed by the Laws,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
is always more dangerous than a much greater Authority, which is derived from them. A <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On ne monte jamais &s;i haut que quand on ne &s;qait pas ou on va,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Cromwell</HI> to the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Bel|lievre.</HI></NOTE>Man po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of u&s;urp'd Authority can &s;et no Bounds to his Preten&s;ions: His Partizans have Liberty to hope for every thing in his Favours: His Enemies provoke his Ambition, along with his Fears, by the Violence of their Oppo&s;ition: And the Government being thrown into a Fer|ment, every corrupted Humour in the State naturally gathers to him. On the contrary, a legal Authority, though very great, has al|ways &s;ome Bounds, which terminate both the Hopes and Preten&s;ions of the Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it: The Laws mu&s;t have provided a Reme|dy again&s;t its Exce&s;&s;es: Such an eminent Ma|gi&s;trate has much to fear, and little to hope from his U&s;urpations: And as his legal Au|thority is quietly &s;ubmitted to, he has little Temptation and little Opportunity of extend|ing it farther. Be&s;ides, it happens, with regard to ambitious Aims and Projects, what may be ob&s;erved with regard to Sects of Philo&s;ophy and Religion. A new Sect excites &s;uch a Fer|ment,
<PB N="99" REF="103">
and is both oppo&s;ed and defended with &s;uch Vehemence, that it &s;preads always fa&s;ter, and multiplies its Partizans with greater Ra|pidity, than any old e&s;tabli&s;hed Opinion, re|commended by the Sanction of the Laws and of Antiquity. Such is the Nature of Novelty, that where any thing plea&s;es, it becomes dou|bly agreeable, if new, but, if it di&s;plea&s;es, it is doubly di&s;plea&s;ing, upon that very Account. And, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, the Violence of Enemies is favourable to ambitious Projects, as well as the Zeal of Partizans.</P>
<P>IT may farther be &s;aid, That tho' Men be very much govern'd by Intere&s;t; yet even In|tere&s;t it&s;elf, and all human Affairs are merely govern'd by <HI>Opinion.</HI> Now, there has been a very &s;udden and a very &s;en&s;ible Change in the Opinions of Men within the&s;e la&s;t Fifty Years, by the Progre&s;s of Learning and of Liberty. Mo&s;t People, in this I&s;land, have dive&s;ted them|&s;elves of all &s;uper&s;titious Reverence to Names and Authority: The Clergy have entirely lo&s;t their Credit: Their Preten&s;ions and Doctrines have been ridicul'd; and even Religion can &s;carce &s;upport it&s;elf in the World. The mere Name of <HI>King</HI> commands little Re&s;pect; and
<PB N="100" REF="104">
to talk of him as GOD's Vicegerent upon Earth, or to give him any of tho&s;e magnifi|cent Titles, which formerly dazl'd Mankind, wou'd but excite Laughter in every one. Tho' the Crown, by Means of its large Revenue, may maintain its Authority in Times of Tran|quility, upon private Intere&s;t and Influence; yet, as the lea&s;t Shock or Convul&s;ion mu&s;t break all the&s;e Intere&s;ts to Pieces, the kingly Power, being no longer &s;upported by the &s;et|tled Principles and Opinions of Men, will im|mediately di&s;&s;olve. Had Men been in the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> as they are at pre&s;ent, Monarchy wou'd have run a great Ri&s;que of being entirely lo&s;t in this I&s;land.</P>

The Tide has run long, and with &s;ome Rapidity, to
<PB N="101" REF="105">
the Side of popular Government, and is ju&s;t beginning to turn towards Monarchy.</P>
<P>'TIS well known, that every Government mu&s;t come to a Period, and that Death is un|avoidable to the political as well as to the ani|mal Body. But, as one Kind of Death may be preferable to another, it may be enquir'd, Whether it be more di&s;irable for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution to terminate in a popular Govern|ment, or in ab&s;olute Monarchy? Here I wou'd declare frankly, that tho' Liberty be infinitely preferable to Slavery, in almo&s;t every Ca&s;e; yet I wou'd much rather wi&s;h to &s;ee an ab&s;o|lute Monarch than a Republic in this I&s;land: For, let us con&s;ider, what Kind of Republic we have Rea&s;on to expect. The Que&s;tion is not concerning any fine imaginary Republic, which a Man may form a Plan of in his Clo|&s;et. There is no Doubt, but a popular Go|vernment may be imagin'd more perfect than ab&s;olute Monarchy, or even than our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution: But what Rea&s;on have we to expect that any &s;uch Government will ever be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Britain,</HI> upon the Di&s;&s;olution of our Monarchy? If any &s;ingle Per&s;on acquire Power enough to take our Con&s;titution to Pie|ces,
<PB N="102" REF="106">
and put it up anew, he is really an ab&s;o|lute Monarch; and we have had already an In&s;tance of this Kind, &s;ufficient to convince us, that &s;uch a Per&s;on will never re&s;ign his Power, or e&s;tabli&s;h any free Government. Matters, therefore, mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to their natural Progre&s;s and Operation; and the Hou&s;e of Commons, according to its pre&s;ent Con&s;ti|tution, mu&s;t-be the only Legi&s;lature in &s;uch a popular Government. The Inconveniencies, attending &s;uch a Situation of Affairs, pre&s;ent them&s;elves by Thou&s;ands. If the Hou&s;e of Commons, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, ever di&s;&s;olves it|&s;elf, which is not to be expected, we may look for a Civil War every Election. If it continues it&s;elf, we &s;hall &s;uffer all the Tyran|ny of a Faction, &s;ub-divided into new Facti|ons: And as &s;uch a violent Government can|not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, we &s;hall, at la&s;t, after infinite Convul&s;ions and Civil Wars, find Repo&s;e in ab&s;olute Monarchy, which it wou'd have been happier for us to have e&s;tabli&s;h'd peace|ably from the Beginning. Ab&s;olute Monar|chy, therefore, is the ea&s;ie&s;t Death, the true <HI>Euthana&s;ia</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>

THUS, if we have Rea&s;on to be more jea|lous of Monarchy, becau&s;e the Danger is more imminent from that Quarter; we have al&s;o Rea&s;on to be more jealous of popular Go|vernment, becau&s;e that Danger is more terri|ble.

<HEAD>ESSAY X. Of PARTIES in general.</HEAD>
<P>OF all Men, that di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves by memorable Atchievements, the fir&s;t Place of Honour, in my Opinion, is due to LEGISLATORS, and Founders of States, who tran&s;mit a Sy|&s;tem of Laws and In&s;titutions to &s;ecure the Peace, Happine&s;s and Liberty of future Gene|rations. The Influence of u&s;eful Inventions in the Arts and Sciences may, perhaps, ex|tend farther than tho&s;e of wi&s;e Laws, who&s;e Effects are limited both in Time and Place; but the Benefit ari&s;ing from the former is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible as that which proceeds from the latter. Speculative Sciences, do, indeed, im|prove the Mind; but this Advantage reaches only to a few Per&s;ons, who have Lei&s;ure to apply them&s;elves to them. And as to practi|cal
<PB N="106" REF="109">
Arts, which encrea&s;e the Commodities and Enjoyments of Life; 'tis well known, that Men's Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in an Abundance of the&s;e, as in the Peace and Secu|rity with which they po&s;&s;e&s;s them: And the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings can only be derived from good Go|vernment. Not to mention, that general Vir|tue and good Morals in a State, which are &s;o requi&s;ite to Happine&s;s, can never ari&s;e from the mo&s;t refined Precepts of Philo&s;ophy, or even the &s;evere&s;t Injunctions of Religion; but mu&s;t proceed entirely from a virtuous Educa|tion, the Effect of wi&s;e Laws and In&s;titutions. I mu&s;t, therefore, be of a different Opinion from my Lord BACON in this Particular, and mu&s;t regard Antiquity as &s;omewhat unju&s;t in in its Di&s;tribution of Honour, when it made Gods of all the Inventors of u&s;eful Arts, &s;uch as <HI>Ceres, Bacchus, Ae&s;culapius;</HI> and dignified Legi&s;lators, &s;uch as <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> on|ly with the Appellation of Demi-Gods and Heroes.</P>
<P>As much as Legi&s;lators and Founders of States ought to be honoured and re&s;pected among Men, as much ought the Founders of Sects and Factions to be dete&s;ted and hated; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="110">
the Influence of Factions is directly contrary to that of Laws. Factions &s;ubvert Government; render Laws impotent, and be|get the fierce&s;t Animo&s;ities among Men of the &s;ame Nation, who ought to give mutual A&s;|&s;i&s;tance and Protection to each other. And what &s;hou'd render the Founders of Factions more odious is the Difficulty of extirpating Factions, when once they have taken ri&s;e in any State. They naturally propagate them&s;elves for many Centuries, and &s;eldom end but by the total Di&s;&s;olution of that Government, in which they are planted. They are, be&s;ides, Seeds, which grow mo&s;t plentifully in the riche&s;t Soils; and though de&s;potic Govern|ments be not entirely free from them, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that they ri&s;e more ea&s;ily, and propagate them&s;elves fa&s;ter in free Govern|ments, where they always infect the Legi&s;la|ture it&s;elf, which alone cou'd be able, by the &s;teady Application of Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, to eradicate them.</P>
<P>FACTIONS or Parties may be divided into PERSONAL and REAL; that is, into Fac|tions founded on per&s;onal Friend&s;hip or Ani|mo&s;ity among tho&s;e who compo&s;e the Fac|tions,
<PB N="108" REF="111">
and into tho&s;e founded on &s;ome real Dif|ference of Sentiment or Intere&s;t. The Rea&s;on of this Di&s;tinction is obvious; though I mu&s;t acknowledge, that Parties are &s;eldom found pure and unmixt, either of the one kind or the other. 'Tis not often &s;een, that a Go|vernment divides into Factions, where there is no Difference in the Views of the&s;e Factions, either real or apparent, trivial or material: And in tho&s;e Factions, which are founded on the mo&s;t real and mo&s;t material Difference, there is always found to be a great deal of per&s;onal Animo&s;ity or Affection. But not|with&s;tanding of this Mixture, a Party may be denominated either per&s;onal or real, accord|ing to that Principle which is predominant, and is ob&s;erved to have the greate&s;t Influence.</P>
<P>PERSONAL Factions ari&s;e mo&s;t ea&s;ily in &s;mall Republics. Every dome&s;tic Quarrel be|comes an Affair of State. Love, Vanity, E|mulation, any Pa&s;&s;ion begets public Divi&s;ion, as well as Ambition and Re&s;entment. The <HI>Neri</HI> and <HI>Bianchi</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> the <HI>Frego&s;i</HI> and <HI>Adorni</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the <HI>Colonne&s;i</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ini</HI> of modern <HI>Rome,</HI> were Parties of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112">
MEN have &s;uch a Propen&s;ity to divide into per&s;onal Factions, that the &s;malle&s;t Appear|ance of real Difference will beget them. What can be imagined more trivial than the Diffe|rence betwixt one Colour of Livery and ano|ther in Hor&s;e-Races? And yet this Difference begot two mo&s;t inveterate Factions in the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire, the <HI>Pra&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Veneti,</HI> who never &s;u&s;pended their Animo&s;ities, 'till they ruined that unhappy Government.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more u&s;ual than to &s;ee Par|ties, which have begun upon a real Difference, continue even after that Difference is lo&s;t. When Men are once inli&s;ted on different Sides, they contract an Affection to the Per&s;ons with whom they are united, and an Animo|&s;ity again&s;t their Antagoni&s;ts: And the&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ions they often tran&s;mit to their Po&s;terity. The real Difference betwixt <HI>Guelf</HI> and <HI>Ghib|belline</HI> was long lo&s;t in <HI>Italy,</HI> before the&s;e Fac|tions were extingui&s;hed. The <HI>Guelfs</HI> adher'd to the Pope, the <HI>Ghibbellines</HI> to the Emperor; and yet the Family of <HI>Sfor&s;a,</HI> who were in Al|liance with the Emperor, though they were <HI>Guelfs,</HI> being expelled <HI>Milan</HI> by the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lewis</HI> XIIth.</NOTE> of
<PB N="110" REF="113">
<HI>France,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Jacomo Trivulzio</HI> and the <HI>Ghibbellines,</HI> the Pope concurred with them, and they form'd Leagues with the Pope again&s;t the Emperor.</P>
<P>THE Civil Wars lately ari&s;en in <HI>Morocco</HI> be|twixt the <HI>Blacks</HI> and <HI>Whites,</HI> merely on ac|count of their Complexion, are founded on a very plea&s;ant Difference. We laugh at them; but I believe, were Things rightly examin'd, we afford much more Occa&s;ion of Ridicule to the <HI>Moors.</HI> For pray, what are all the Wars of Religion, which have prevail'd in this po|lite and knowing Part of the World? They are, in my Opinion, more ab&s;urd than the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Civil Wars. The Difference of Com|plexion is a &s;en&s;ible and a real Difference: But the Difference about an Article of Faith, which is utterly ab&s;urd and unintelligible, is not a real Difference of Sentiments, but only a Difference of a few Phra&s;es and Expre&s;&s;ions, which one Party accepts of, without under|&s;tanding them; and the other refu&s;es, in the &s;ame Manner. Be&s;ides, I do not find, that the <HI>Whites</HI> in <HI>Morocco</HI> ever impos'd on the <HI>Blacks</HI> any Nece&s;&s;ity of altering their Com|plexion, or threaten'd them with Inqui&s;itions
<PB N="111" REF="114">
and penal Laws in ca&s;e of Ob&s;tinacy: Nor have the <HI>Blacks</HI> been more unrea&s;onable in this Particular. But is a Man's Opinion, where he is able to form a real Opinion, more at his Di&s;po&s;al than his Complexion? And can one be induc'd by Force or Fear to do more than paint and Di&s;gui&s;e in the one Ca&s;e as well as in the other?</P>
<P><HI>REAL</HI> Factions may be divided into Fac|tions from <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> from <HI>Principle,</HI> and from <HI>Affection.</HI> Of all Factions, tho&s;e from Inte|re&s;t are the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and the mo&s;t ex|cu&s;able. Where two Orders of Men, &s;uch as the Nobles and People, have a di&s;tinct Au|thority in a Government, which is not very accurately ballanc'd and modell'd, they natu|rally follow a di&s;tinct Intere&s;t; nor can we rea&s;onably expect a different Conduct from that Degree of Selfi&s;hne&s;s, which is implanted in human Nature. It requires very great Skill in a Legi&s;lator to prevent &s;uch Factions; and many Philo&s;ophers are of Opinion, that this Secret, like the <HI>Grand Elixir,</HI> or <HI>Perpetual Mo|tion,</HI> may amu&s;e Men in Theory, but can ne|ver po&s;&s;ibly be reduc'd to Practice. In de&s;|potick Governments, indeed, Factions often
<PB N="112" REF="115">
do not appear; but they are never the le&s;s real; or rather, they are more real and more pernicious, upon that very Account. The di|&s;tinct Orders of Men, Nobles and People, Soldiers and Merchants, have all a di&s;tinct Intere&s;t; but the more Powerful oppre&s;&s;es the Weaker with Impunity, and without Re|&s;i&s;tance; which begets a &s;eeming Tranquillity in &s;uch Governments.</P>
<P>THERE has been an Attempt to divide the <HI>landed</HI> and <HI>trading</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>England;</HI> but without Succe&s;s. The Intere&s;t of the&s;e two Bodies is not really di&s;tinct, and never will be &s;o, till our public Debts increa&s;e to &s;uch a Degree, as to become altogether oppre&s;&s;ive and intolerable.</P>
<P>PARTIES from <HI>Principles,</HI> e&s;pecially ab|&s;tract &s;peculative Principles, are known only to modern Times, and are, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary and unaccountable <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> that have ever yet appear'd in human Affairs. Where different Principles beget a Contrari|ety of Conduct, as all different political Prin|ciples do, the Matter may be more ea&s;ily ex|plain'd. A Man, who e&s;teems the true Right
<PB N="113" REF="116">
of Government to ly in one Man, or one Fa|mily, cannot ea&s;ily agree with his Fellow-Citizen, who thinks, that another Man or Family is po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Right. Each natural|ly wi&s;hes that Right may take Place, accor|ding to his own Notions of it. But where the Difference of Principles begets no Contra|riety of Action, but each may follow his own Way, without interfering with his Neigh|bour, as happens in all religious Controver|&s;ies; what Madne&s;s, what Fury can beget &s;uch unhappy and &s;uch fatal Divi&s;ions?</P>
<P>TWO Men, travelling on the High-way, of whom one goes Ea&s;t, the other We&s;t, can ea&s;ily pa&s;s each other, if the Way be broad enough: But two Men, rea&s;oning upon op|po&s;ite Principles of Religion, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily pa&s;s, without &s;hocking; tho' one &s;hou'd think, that the Way were al&s;o, in that Ca&s;e, &s;uffici|ently broad, and that each might proceed, without Interruption, in his own Way. But &s;uch is the Nature of the human Mind, that it always takes hold of every Mind that ap|proaches it; and as it is wonderfully &s;trength|en'd and corroborated by an Unanimity of Sentiments, &s;o it is &s;hock'd and di&s;turb'd by
<PB N="114" REF="117">
any Contrariety. Hence the Eagerne&s;s, which mo&s;t People di&s;cover in a Di&s;pute; hence their Impatience of Oppo&s;ition, even in the mo&s;t &s;peculative and indifferent Opinions.</P>
<P>THIS Principle, however frivolous it may appear, &s;eems to have been the Origin of all religious Wars and Divi&s;ions. But, as this Principle is univer&s;al in human Nature, its Effects wou'd not have been confin'd to one Age, and to one Sect of Religion, did it not there concur with other more accidental Cau|&s;es, which rai&s;e it to &s;uch a Height, as to cau&s;e the highe&s;t Mi&s;ery and Deva&s;tation. Mo&s;t Religions of the antient World aro&s;e in the unknown Ages of Government, when Men were as yet barbarous and unin&s;tructed, and the Prince, as well as Pea&s;ant, were di&s;|pos'd to receive, with implicite Faith, every pious Tale or Fiction that was offer'd them. The Magi&s;trate embrac'd the Religion of the People, and entering cordially into the Care of &s;acred Matters, naturally acquir'd an Au|thority in them, and united the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical with the Civil Power. But the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Reli|gion ari&s;ing, while Principles directly oppo&s;ite to it were firmly e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the polite Part
<PB N="115" REF="118">
of the World, who de&s;pis'd the Nation that fir&s;t broach'd this Novelty; no Wonder, that Chri&s;tianity, in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, was but little countenanc'd by the Civil Magi&s;trate, and that the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;thood were allow|ed to engro&s;s all the Authority in the new Sect. So bad a U&s;e did they make of this Power, even in tho&s;e early Times, that the Perfecutions of Chri&s;tianity may, perhaps, in Part, be a&s;crib'd to the Violence in&s;till'd by them into their Followers. And the &s;ame Principles of Prie&s;tly Government continuing, after Chri&s;tianity became the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Re|ligion, they have engender'd a Spirit of Per|&s;ecution, which has ever &s;ince been the Poi|&s;on of human Society, and the Source of the mo&s;t inveterate Factions in every Government. Such Factions, therefore, on the Part of the poor People, may ju&s;tly be e&s;teem'd Factions of <HI>Principle;</HI> but on the Part of the Prie&s;ts, who are the prime Movers, they are really Factions of <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another Cau&s;e (be&s;ide the Au|thority of the Prie&s;ts, and the Separation of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil Powers) that has contributed to render <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> the Scene
<PB N="116" REF="119">
of religious Wars and Divi&s;ions. Religions, that ari&s;e in Ages totally ignorant and barba|rous, con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of traditional Tales and Fictions, which may be very different in eve|ry Sect, without being contrary to each o|ther; and even when they are contrary, eve|ry one adheres to the Tradition of his own Sect, without much Rea&s;oning or Di&s;putation. But as Philo&s;ophy was widely &s;pread over the World, at the Time that Chri&s;tianity aro&s;e, the Teachers of the new Sect were oblig'd to form a Sy&s;tem of &s;peculative Opinions; to di|vide, with &s;ome Accuracy, their Articles of Faith; and to explain, comment, confute, and confirm with all the Subtility of Argu|ment and Science. From hence naturally a|ro&s;e Keenne&s;s in Di&s;pute, when Chri&s;tianity came to be &s;plit into new Divi&s;ions and Here|&s;ies: And this Keenne&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Prie&s;ts in their pernicious Policy, of begetting a mutual Hatred and Antipathy among their deluded Followers. Sects of Philo&s;ophy, in the an|tient World, were more zealous than Parties of Religion; but, in modern Times, Parties of Religion are more furious and enrag'd than the mo&s;t cruel Factions, that ever aro&s;e from Intere&s;t and Ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="120">
I HAVE mention'd Parties from <HI>Affection</HI> as a kind of <HI>real</HI> Parties, be&s;ide tho&s;e from <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>Principle.</HI> By Parties from Affection, I under&s;tand tho&s;e which are founded on the different Affections of Men towards particu|lar Families and Per&s;ons, whom they de&s;ire to rule over them. The&s;e Parties are often very violent, though I mu&s;t own it is &s;ome|what unaccountable, that Men &s;hou'd attach them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly to Per&s;ons, whom they are no way acquainted with, whom perhaps they never &s;aw, and from whom they never received nor can ever hope for any Favour. Yet this we find often to be the Ca&s;e, and e|ven with Men, who, on other Occa&s;ions, di&s;|cover no great Genero&s;ity of Spirit, nor are found to be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported by Friend&s;hip beyond their own Intere&s;t. We are apt, I know not how, to think the Relation betwixt us and our Sovereign very clo&s;e and intimate. The Splendor of Maje&s;ty and Power be&s;tows an Importance on the Fortunes even of a &s;in|gle Per&s;on. And when a Man's Good-nature does not give him this imaginary Intere&s;t, his Ill-nature will do it, from Spite and Oppo&s;i|tion to Per&s;ons, who&s;e Sentiments are diffe|rent from his own.</P>

<P>WERE the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government pro|po&s;ed as a Subject of Speculation to a &s;tudious Man, he wou'd im|mediately perceive in it a Source of Divi&s;ion and Party, which it wou'd be al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for it, in any Admini&s;tration, to avoid.

of Monarchy, than Men of bold Spirits, who are pa&s;&s;ionate Lovers of Liberty, and think no Evil comparable to Subjection and Sla|very. And though all rea&s;onable Men agree in general to pre&s;erve our mixt Government; yet when they come to Particulars, &s;ome will incline to tru&s;t larger Powers to the Crown, to be&s;tow on it more Influence, and to guard again&s;t its Encroachments with le&s;s Caution, than others who are terrified at the mo&s;t di|&s;tant Approaches of Tyranny and de&s;potic Power.

Strength and Violence of each of the&s;e Parties will much depend upon the particular Admi|ni&s;tration.

But, however the Nation may fluctuate betwixt the&s;e two Par|ties, the Parties will always &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as long as we are govern'd by a limited Monarchy.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides this Difference of <HI>Principle,</HI> tho&s;e Parties are very much fomented by a Difference of INTEREST, without which they cou'd &s;carce ever be dangerous or violent. The Crown will naturally be&s;tow all its Tru&s;t and Power upon tho&s;e, who&s;e Principles, real or pretended, are mo&s;t favourable to Monar|chical Government; and this Temptation will naturally engage them to go greater Lengths than their Principles wou'd otherwi&s;e carry them. Their Antagoni&s;ts, who are di&s;appoin|ted in their ambitious Aims, throw them&s;elves into the Party, who&s;e Principles incline them to be mo&s;t jealous of Royal Power, and natu|rally carry tho&s;e Principles to a greater Length than &s;ound Politics will ju&s;tify. Thus, the
<PB N="122" REF="124">
<HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> Parties, which are the ge|nuine Factions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, are a kind of mixt Parties, and are influenced part|ly by Principle, partly by Intere&s;t. The Heads of the Parties are commonly mo&s;t governed by the latter Motive; the inferior Members of them, by the former. I mu&s;t be under|&s;tood to mean this of Per&s;ons who have any Mo|tive for taking Party on any Side. For, to tell the Truth, the greate&s;t Part are common|ly Men who a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves they know not why; from Example, from Pa&s;&s;ion, from Idlene&s;s.

<P>AS to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Parties; we may ob|&s;erve, that, in all Ages of the World, Prie&s;ts have been Enemies to Liberty; and 'tis cer|tain, that this &s;teady Conduct of theirs mu&s;t have been founded on fixt Rea&s;ons of Intere&s;t and Ambition. Liberty of thinking, and of expre&s;&s;ing our Thoughts, is always fatal to Prie&s;tly Power, and to tho&s;e pious Frauds, on which it is commonly founded; and by
<PB N="123" REF="125">
an infallible Connexion, which is found among every Species of Liberty, this Privilege can never be enjoy'd, at lea&s;t, has never yet been enjoy'd, but in a free Government.

All Princes, that have aimed at de&s;potic Power, have known this important Intere&s;t of gaining the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Clergy: As the Clergy, on their Side, have &s;hewn a great Facility of entering into the Views of &s;uch Princes. <HI>Gu&s;tavus Vaza</HI> was, perhaps, the only ambitious Monarch, that ever depre&s;s'd the Church, at the &s;ame Time, that he di&s;couraged Liberty. But the exorbitant Power of the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Sweden,</HI> who at that Time overtop'd the Crown, along with their Attachment to a foreign Family, was the Rea&s;on of his embracing &s;uch an un|u&s;ual Piece of Politics.</P>

But if a Prince has the Choice of both, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that he will prefer the Epi&s;copal to the Presbyterian Form of Government; both becau&s;e of the greater Affinity betwixt Monarchy and Epi&s;copacy, and becau&s;e of the Facility which a Prince finds in &s;uch a Govern|ment, of ruling the Clergy, by Means of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Superiors.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of Parties in <HI>England,</HI> during the Civil Wars, we &s;hall find, that they were exactly conformable to this general Theory, and that the Species of the Government gave Birth to them, by a regu|lar and infallible Operation. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con|&s;titution, before that Time, had lain in a Kind of Confu&s;ion; yet &s;o, as that the Subjects po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd many noble Privileges, which, though not, perhaps, exactly bounded and &s;ecur'd by Law, were univer&s;ally deem'd, from long

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to belong to them as their Birth-Right. An ambitious, or rather an ignorant, Prince aro&s;e, who e&s;teem'd all the&s;e Privi|leges to be Conce&s;&s;ions of his Predece&s;&s;ors, revocable at Plea&s;ure; and in Pro&s;ecution of this Principle, he openly acted in Violation of Liberty, during the Cour&s;e of &s;everal Years. Nece&s;&s;ity, at la&s;t, con&s;train'd him to call a Parliament: The Spirit of Liberty aro&s;e: The Prince, being without any Support, was obli|ged to grant every Thing requir'd of him: And his Enemies, jealous and implacable, &s;et no Bounds to their Preten&s;ions. Here then begun tho&s;e Conte&s;ts, in which it was no Wonder, that Men of that Age were divided into different Parties; &s;ince, even at this Day, the Impartial are at a Lo&s;s to decide concern|ing the Ju&s;tice of the Quarrel. The Preten&s;i|ons of the Parliament, if yielded to, broke the Ballance of our Con&s;titution, by rende|ring the Government almo&s;t entirely Republi|can. If not yielded to, we were, perhaps, &s;till in Danger of de&s;potic Power, from the &s;ettled Principles and inveterate Habits of the King, which had plainly appear'd in every Conce&s;&s;ion, that he had been con&s;train'd to make to his People. In this Que&s;tion, &s;o de|licate
<PB N="126" REF="128">
and uncertain, Men naturally fell to the Side, which was mo&s;t conformable to their u&s;ual Principles; and tho&s;e, who were the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Favourers of Monarchy, de|clar'd for the King; as the zealous Friends of Liberty &s;ided with the Parliament. The Hopes of Succe&s;s being nearly equal on both Sides, <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> had little Influence in this Conte&s;t: So that ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER were merely Parties of Principle; neither of which di&s;own'd either Monarchy or Liberty; but the former Party inclin'd mo&s;t to the Republi|can Part of our Government, and the latter to the Monarchial. In which re&s;pect they may be con&s;ider'd as Court and Country-Par|ty enflam'd into a Civil War, by an unhappy Concurrence of Circum&s;tances, and by the turbulent Spirit of the Age. The Common|wealth's-Men, and the Partizans of de&s;potic Power, lay conceal'd in both Parties, and form'd but an incon&s;iderable Part of them.</P>
<P>THE Clergy had concurr'd, in a &s;hamele&s;s Manner, with the King's arbitrary De&s;igns, according to their u&s;ual Maxims in &s;uch Ca|&s;es: And, in Return, were allow'd to per&s;ecute their Adver&s;aries, whom they call'd Heretics

and Schi&s;matics. The e&s;tabli&s;h'd Clergy was Epi&s;copal; the Non-conformi&s;ts Presbyteri|ans: So that all Things concurr'd to throw the former, without Re&s;erve, into the King's Party; and the latter into that of the Parlia|ment. The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> being the Court-Party, and the <HI>Round-heads</HI> the Country-Party, the Union was infallible betwixt the former and the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Prelacy, and betwixt the latter and Presbyterian Non-conformi&s;ts.

What the Nature is of the&s;e Parties, is, per|haps, one of the mo&s;t difficult Que&s;tions that can be met with, and is a Proof, that Hi&s;tory may contain Problems, as uncertain as any that are to be found in the mo&s;t ab&s;tract Sci|ences. We have &s;een the Conduct of the&s;e two Parties, during the Cour&s;e of Seventy Years, in a va&s;t Variety of Circum&s;tances, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Power, and depriv'd of it, during Peace and during War: We meet with Per|&s;ons, who profe&s;s them&s;elves of one Side or t'other, every Hour, in Company, in our Plea&s;ures, in our &s;erious Occupations: We our&s;elves are con&s;train'd, in a Manner, to take Party; and living in a Country of the highe&s;t Liberty, every one may openly declare all his Sentiments and Opinions: And yet we are at a Lo&s;s to tell the Nature, Preten&s;ions, and Principles of the two Parties. The Que&s;tion is, perhaps, in it&s;elf, &s;omewhat difficult; but has been render'd more &s;o, by the Prejudices and Violence of Party.</P>
<P>WHEN we compare the Parties of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>Round-head</HI> and <HI>Cava|lier,</HI> the mo&s;t obvious Difference, that ap|pears betwixt them, con&s;i&s;ts in the Doctrines

<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, They appear to have had the Sentiments of true <HI>Britons</HI> in their Affec|tion to Liberty, and their determin'd Re&s;olu|tion not to &s;acrifice it to any ab&s;tract Princi|ples what&s;oever, or to any imaginary Rights of Princes.

<P>THE celebrated Writer above cited, has a&s;|&s;erted, that the REAL Di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> was lo&s;t at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and that

ever &s;ince they have continued to be mere <HI>per|&s;onal</HI> Parties, like the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Ghibbellines,</HI> after the Emperors had lo&s;t all Authority in <HI>Italy.</HI> Such an Opinion, were it received, wou'd turn our whole Hi&s;tory into an Aenig|ma; and is, indeed, &s;o contrary to the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, that a Man mu&s;t have a great Opi|nion of his own Eloquence to attempt the pro|ving of it.</P>
<P>I SHALL fir&s;t mention, as an irre&s;i&s;tible Proof of a real Di&s;tinction betwixt the&s;e Par|ties, what every one may have ob&s;erv'd or heard concerning the Conduct and Conver&s;ation of all his Friends and Acquaintance on both Sides. Have not the <HI>Tories</HI> always bore an avowed Affection to the Family of <HI>Stuart,</HI> and have not their Adver&s;aries always oppo&s;ed with Vi|gour the Succe&s;&s;ion of that Family?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Tory</HI> Principles are confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t favourable to Monarchy. Yet the <HI>Tories</HI> have almo&s;t always oppo&s;ed the Court the&s;e fifty Years; nor were they cordial Friends to King <HI>William,</HI> even when employ'd by him. Their Quarrel, therefore, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed

to have lain with the Throne, but with the Per&s;on, who &s;at on it.</P>
<P>THEY concurr'd heartily with the Court during the four la&s;t Years of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> But is any one at a lo&s;s to find the Rea&s;on?</P>
<P>'TIS mon&s;trous to &s;ee an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Epi&s;co|pal Clergy in declar'd Oppo&s;ition to the Court, and a Nonconformi&s;t Presbyterian Clergy in Conjunction with it. What can produce &s;uch an unnatural Conduct in both? Nothing but that the former have e&s;pou&s;ed Monarchical Principles too high for the pre&s;ent Settlement, which is founded on Principles of Liberty: And the latter, being afraid of the Prevalence of tho&s;e high Principles, adhere to that Par|ty, from whom they have Rea&s;on to expect Liberty and Toleration.</P>
<P>THE different Conduct of the two Parties, with regard to foreign Politics, is al&s;o a Proof to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. <HI>Holland</HI> has always been mo&s;t favour'd by one, and <HI>France</HI> by the other. In &s;hort, the Proofs of this kind are &s;o palpa|ble and evident, that one is almo&s;t a&s;ham'd to collect them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
A <HI>Tory</HI> is <HI>a Lover of Monarchy, though without abandoning Liberty; and a Partizan of the Family of</HI> STUART. A <HI>Whig</HI> is <HI>a Lover of Liberty, though without renouncing Monar|chy; and a Friend to the Settlement in the</HI> Pro|te&s;tant <HI>Line.</HI> The&s;e different Views, with re|gard to the Settlement of the Crown, are ac|cidental, but natural Additions to the Princi|ples of the <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> Parties, which are the genuine Parties of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Govern|ment. A pa&s;&s;ionate Lover of Monarchy is apt to be di&s;plea&s;ed at any Change of this Succe&s;|&s;ion; as &s;avouring too much of a Common|wealth: A pa&s;&s;ionate Lover of Liberty is apt to think that every Part of the Government ought to be &s;ubordinate to the Intere&s;ts of Li|berty. 'Tis however remarkable, that though the Principles of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> be both of them of a compound Nature; yet the Ingre|dients, which predominated in both, were not corre&s;pondent to each other. A <HI>Tory</HI> loved Monarchy, and bore an Affection to the Fa|mily of <HI>Stuart;</HI> but the latter Affection was the predominant Inclination of the Party. A <HI>Whig</HI> loved Liberty, and was a Friend to the Settlement in the <HI>Pote&s;tant</HI> Line; but the Love of Liberty was profe&s;&s;edly his predominant In|clination.
<PB N="135" REF="137">
The <HI>Tories</HI> have frequently acted as Republicans, where either Policy or Revenge has engag'd them to that Conduct; and there was none of that Party, who, upon the Suppo&s;i|tion, that they were to be di&s;appointed in their Views with regard to the Succe&s;&s;ion, would not have de&s;ired to impo&s;e the &s;tricte&s;t Limi|tations on the Crown, and to bring our Form of Government as near Republican as po&s;&s;ible, in order to depre&s;s the Family, that, accord|ing to their Apprehen&s;ion, &s;ucceeded without any ju&s;t Title. The <HI>Whigs,</HI> 'tis true, have al|&s;o taken Steps dangerous to Liberty, under Pretext of &s;ecuring the Succe&s;&s;ion and Settle|ment of the Crown, according to their Views: But as the Body of the Party had no Pa&s;&s;ion for that Succe&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e than as the Means of &s;ecuring Liberty, they have been betray'd into the&s;e Steps by Ignorance or Frail|ty, or the Intere&s;t of their Leaders. The Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Crown was, therefore, the chief Point with the <HI>Tories:</HI> The Security of our Liberties with the <HI>Whigs.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis Difficult to penetrate into the Thoughts and Sentiments of any particular Man; but 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e of a

whole Party, where it often happens, that no two Per&s;ons agree preci&s;ely in the &s;ame Way of thinking. Yet I will venture to affirm, that it was not &s;o much PRINCIPLE, or an Opinion of indefeazible Right, that attach'd the <HI>Tories</HI> to the antient Royal Family, as AF|FECTION, or a certain Love and E&s;teem for their Per&s;ons. The &s;ame Cau&s;e divided <HI>Eng|land</HI> formerly betwixt the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> betwixt the Families of <HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Baliol;</HI> in an Age, when politi|cal <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> were but little in Fa&s;hion, and when political <HI>Principles</HI> mu&s;t of Cour&s;e have had but little Influence on Mankind. The Doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive Obedience is &s;o ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, and &s;o oppo&s;ite to our Liberties, that it &s;eems to have been chiefly left to Pulpit De|claimers, and to their deluded Followers a|mong the Mob. Men of better Sen&s;e were guided by <HI>Affection;</HI> and as to the Leaders of this Party, it's probable, that <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> was their &s;ole Motive, and that they acted more contra|ry to their private Sentiments, than the Lea|ders of the oppo&s;ite Party.</P>
<P>SOME, who will not venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>real</HI> Difference betwixt <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> was
<PB N="137" REF="139">
lo&s;t at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> &s;eem inclin'd to think, that the Difference is now aboli&s;h'd, and that Affairs are &s;o far return'd to their natural State, that there are at pre&s;ent no other Par|ties among&s;t us but <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country;</HI> that is, Men, who by Intere&s;t or Principle are at|tach'd either to Monarchy or to Liberty.

There is no Man of Knowledge or Learning, who wou'd not be a&s;ham'd to be thought of that Party; and in almo&s;t all Com|panies the Name of OLD WHIG is mention'd as an unconte&s;table Appellation of Honour and Dignity.

with all their old Prejudices; and a demon|&s;trative Proof, that <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> are not our only Parties, is, that almo&s;t all the Di&s;&s;enters &s;ide with the Court, and the lower Clergy, at lea&s;t, of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with the Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>ISHALL conclude this Subject with ob&s;er|ving, that we never had any <HI>Tories</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> according to the proper Signification of the Word, and that the Divi&s;ion of Parties in this Country was really into <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Ja|cobites.</HI> A <HI>Jacobite</HI> &s;eems to be a <HI>Tory,</HI> who has no Regard to the Con&s;titution, but is ei|ther a zealous Partizan of ab&s;olute Monarchy, or at lea&s;t willing to &s;acrifice our Liberties to the obtaining the Succe&s;&s;ion in that Family, to which he is attach'd. The Rea&s;on of the Difference betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> I take to be this. Our political and our religi|ous Divi&s;ions in this Country, have been, &s;ince the <HI>Revolution,</HI> regularly corre&s;pondent to each other. The <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were all <HI>Whigs</HI> without Exception: The <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> of the oppo&s;ite Party.

<PB N="139" REF="141">
to make any Compliances with the Go|vernment in their Oaths or Forms of Prayer, but openly avow'd the highe&s;t Principles of their Party; which is the Cau&s;e, why their Followers have been more bare-fac'd and vio|lent than their Brethren of the <HI>Tory</HI> Party in <HI>England.</HI> As violent Things have not com|monly &s;o long a Duration as moderate, we actually find, that the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party is almo&s;t entirely vani&s;h'd from among us, and that the Di&s;tinction of <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> which is but creeping in at <HI>London,</HI> is the only one that is ever mention'd in this Kingdom. Be|&s;ide the Violence and Openne&s;s of the <HI>Jaco|bite</HI> Party, another Rea&s;on has, perhaps, con|tributed to produce &s;o &s;udden and &s;o vi&s;ible an Alteration in this Part of <HI>Britain.</HI> There are only two Ranks of Men among us; Gentlemen, who have &s;ome Fortune and Edu|cation, and the meane&s;t &s;laving Poor; with|out any con&s;iderable Number of that middling Rank of Men, which abounds more in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> both in Cities and in the Country, than in any other Part of the World.

<HEAD>ESSAY XII. Of SUPERSTITION and EN|THUSIASM.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THAT the Corruption of the be&s;t Things produces the wor&s;t,</HI> is grown into a Maxim, and is verify'd, among other In&s;tances, by the pernicious Effects of <HI>Super|&s;tition</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> the Corruptions of true Religion.</P>
<P>THESE two Species of fal&s;e Religion, tho' both pernicious, yet are of a very different, and even of a contrary Nature. The Mind of Man is &s;ubject to certain unaccountable Ter|rors and Apprehen&s;ions, proceeding either from the unhappy Situation of private or pu|blic Affairs, from ill Health, from a gloomy and melancholy Di&s;po&s;ition, or from the Con|currence of all the&s;e Circum&s;tances. In &s;uch
<PB N="142" REF="144">
a State of Mind, infinite unknown Evils are dreaded from unknown Agents; and where real Objects of Terror are wanting, the Soul, active to its own Prejudice, and fo&s;tering its predominant Inclination, finds imaginary Ones, to who&s;e Power and Malevolence it &s;ets no Limits. As the&s;e Enemies are invi&s;i|ble and unknown, the Methods taken to ap|pea&s;e them are as unaccountable, and con&s;i&s;t in Ceremonies, Ob&s;ervances, Mortifications, Sacrifices, Pre&s;ents, or in any Practice, how|ever ab&s;urd and frivolous, which either Folly or Knavery recommends to a blind and terri|fy'd Credulity. Weakne&s;s, Fear, Melancholy, along with Ignorance, are, therefore, the true Sources of SUPERSTITION.</P>
<P>BUT the Mind of Man is al&s;o &s;ubject to an unaccountable Elevation and Pre&s;umption, proceeding from pro&s;perous Succe&s;s, from luxuriant Health, from &s;trong Spirits, and from a bold and confident Di&s;po&s;ition. In &s;uch a State of Mind, the Imagination &s;wells with great, but confus'd Conceptions, to which no &s;ublunary Beauties or Enjoyments can corre&s;pond. Every Thing mortal and peri&s;hable vani&s;hes as unworthy of Attention.
<PB N="143" REF="145">
And a full Range is given to the Fancy in the invi&s;ible Regions or World of Spirits, where the Soul is at Liberty to indulge it&s;elf in every Imagination, that may be&s;t &s;uit its pre&s;ent Ta&s;te and Di&s;po&s;ition. Hence ari&s;e Raptures, Tran&s;ports, and &s;urprizing Flights of Fancy; and Confidence and Pre&s;umption &s;till increa|&s;ing, the&s;e Raptures, being altogether unac|countable, and &s;eeming quite beyond the Reach of our ordinary Faculties, are attribu|ted to the immediate In&s;piration of that Di|vine Being, who is the Object of Devotion. In a little Time, the in&s;pir'd Per&s;on comes to regard him&s;elf as the chief Favourite of the Divinity; and when this Frenzy once takes Place, which is the Summit of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, every Whim&s;y is con&s;ecrated: Human Rea|&s;on, and even Morality are rejected as falla|cious Guides: And the fanatic Madman deli|vers him&s;elf over, blindly and without Re|&s;erve, to the &s;uppos'd Illap&s;es of the Spirit, and to In&s;pirations from above.

THESE two Species of fal&s;e Religion might afford Occa&s;ion to many Speculations; but I &s;hall confine my &s;elf at pre&s;ent to a few Re|flections concerning their different Influence on Government and Society.</P>
<P>MY fir&s;t Reflection is, that Religions, which partake of Enthu&s;ia&s;m are, on their fir&s;t Ri&s;e, much more furious and violent than the&s;e which partake of Super&s;tition; but in a little Time become much more gentle and moderate. The violence of this Species of Religion, when excited by Novelty, and animated by Oppo&s;i|tion, appears from numberle&s;s In&s;tances; of the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Cami&s;ars</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Levellers</HI> and other Fanatics in <HI>England,</HI> and the Covenanters in <HI>Scotland.</HI> As Enthu&s;ia&s;m is founded on &s;trong Spirits, and a pre&s;umptuous Boldne&s;s of Character, it naturally begets the mo&s;t extreme Re&s;olutions; e&s;pecially after it ri&s;es to that Height as to in|&s;pire the deluded Fanatics with the Opinion of Divine Illuminations, and with a Contempt of the common Rules of Rea&s;on, Morality and Prudence.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
'TIS thus Enthu&s;ia&s;m produces the mo&s;t cruel De&s;olation in human Society: But its Fury is like that of Thunder and Tempe&s;t, which ex|hau&s;t them&s;elves in a little Time, and leave the Air more calm and &s;erene than before. The Rea&s;on of this will appear evidently by comparing Enthu&s;ia&s;m to Super&s;tition, the o|ther Species of fal&s;e Religion; and tracing the natural Con&s;equences of each. As Super&s;ti|tion is founded on Fear, Sorrow, and a Depre&s;|&s;ion of Spirits, it repre&s;ents the Per&s;on to him|&s;elf in &s;uch de&s;picable Colours, that he appears unworthy in his own Eyes of approaching the Divine Pre&s;ence, and naturally has Recour&s;e to any other Per&s;on, who&s;e Sanctity of Life, or, perhaps, Impudence and Cunning, have made him be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more favoured by the Divinity. To him they entru&s;t their Devotions: To his Care they recommend their Prayers, Petitions, and Sacrifices: And by his Means hope to render their Addre&s;&s;es accep|table to their incen&s;ed Deity. Hence the O|rigin of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> I under&s;tand only the Pretenders to Power and Dominion, and to a &s;uperior Sanctity of Character, di&s;tinct from Virtue and good Morals. The&s;e are very different from <HI>Clergymen,</HI> who are &s;et apart to the Care of &s;acred Matters, and the Conduct|ing our public Devotions with greater Decency and Order. There is no Rank of Men more to be re&s;pected than the latter.</NOTE>PRIESTS, who may ju&s;tly be regarded
<PB N="146" REF="148">
as proceeding from one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Inven|tions of a timorous and abject Super&s;tition, which, ever diffident of it&s;elf, dares not offer up its own Devotions, but ignorantly thinks to recommend it&s;elf to the Divinity by the Medi|ation of his &s;uppo&s;ed Friends and Servants. As Super&s;tition is a con&s;iderable Ingredient of almo&s;t all Religions, even the mo&s;t fanatical; there being nothing but Philo&s;ophy able to conquer entirely the&s;e unaccountable Terrors; hence it proceeds, that in almo&s;t every Sect of Religion there are Prie&s;ts to be found: But the &s;tronger Mixture there is of Super&s;tition, the higher is the Authority of the Prie&s;thood. Modern Judai&s;m and Popery, e&s;pecially the latter, being the mo&s;t barbarous and ab&s;urd Super&s;titions, that have yet been known in the World, are the mo&s;t en&s;lav'd by their Prie&s;ts. As the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a &s;trong Mix|ture of Popi&s;h Super&s;tition, it partakes al&s;o, in its original Con&s;titution, of a Propen&s;ity to Prie&s;tly Power and Dominion; particularly in
<PB N="147" REF="149">
the Re&s;pect it exacts to the Prie&s;t. And tho', according to the Sentiments of that Church, the Prayers of the Prie&s;t mu&s;t be accompanied with tho&s;e of the Laity; yet is he the Mouth of the Congregation, his Per&s;on is &s;acred, and without his Pre&s;ence few wou'd think their public Devotions, or the Sacraments and o|ther Rites, acceptable to the Divinity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be ob&s;erved, that all Enthu&s;ia&s;ts have been free from the Yoke of Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and have expre&s;t a great Independence in their Devotion; with a Con|tempt of Forms, Traditions and Authorities. The <HI>Quakers</HI> are the mo&s;t egregious, tho' at the &s;ame Time the mo&s;t innocent, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts that have been yet known; and are, perhaps, the only Sect, that have never admitted Prie&s;ts among&s;t them: The <HI>Independents,</HI> of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sectaries, approach neare&s;t to the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> in Fanatici&s;m, and in their Freedom from Prie&s;tly Bondage. The <HI>Presbyterians</HI> follow after, at an equal Di&s;tance in both the&s;e Parti|culars. In &s;hort, this Ob&s;ervation is founded on the mo&s;t certain Experience; and will al&s;o appear to be founded on Rea&s;on, if we con&s;i|der that as Enthu&s;ia&s;m ari&s;es from a pre&s;ump|tuous
<PB N="148" REF="150">
Pride and Confidence, it thinks it&s;elf &s;ufficiently qualified to <HI>approach</HI> the Divinity, without any human Mediator. Its rapturous Devotions are &s;o &s;ervent, that it even ima|gines it&s;elf <HI>actually</HI> to <HI>approach</HI> him, by the Way of Contemplation and inward Conver&s;e; which makes it neglect all tho&s;e outward Ce|remonies and Ob&s;ervances, to which the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Prie&s;t appears &s;o requi&s;ite in the Eyes of their &s;uper&s;titious Votaries. The Fanatic con&s;ecrates him&s;elf, and be&s;tows on his own Per&s;on a &s;acred Character, much &s;u|perior to what Forms and Ceremonious In&s;ti|tions can confer on any other.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore an infallible Rule, that Su|per&s;tition is favourable to Prie&s;tly Power, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m as much, or rather more, contrary to it than &s;ound Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy. The Con&s;equences are evident. When the fir&s;t Fire of Enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;pent, Men naturally, in &s;uch fanatical Sects, &s;ink into the greate&s;t Remi&s;sne&s;s and Coolne&s;s in Sacred Matters; there being no Body of Men among&s;t them, endow'd with &s;ufficient Authority, who&s;e In|tere&s;t is concern'd to &s;upport the religious Spirit. Super&s;tition, on the contrary, &s;teals
<PB N="149" REF="151">
in gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly; renders Men tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; is acceptable to the Magi|&s;trate, and &s;eems inoffen&s;ive to the People: Till at la&s;t the Prie&s;t, having firmly e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Authority, becomes the Tyrant and Di|&s;turber of human Society, by his endle&s;s Con|tentions, Per&s;ecutions, and religious Wars. How &s;moothly did the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church ad|vance in their Acqui&s;ition of Power? But in|to what di&s;mal Convul&s;ions did they throw all <HI>Europe,</HI> in order to maintain it? On the other Hand, our Sectaries, who were former|ly &s;uch dangerous Bigots, are now become our greate&s;t Free-thinkers; and the <HI>Quakers</HI> are, perhaps, the only regular Body of <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> in the Univer&s;e, except the <HI>Literati</HI> or Di&s;ci|ples of <HI>Confucius</HI> in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>MY &s;econd Ob&s;ervation, with regard to the&s;e Species of fal&s;e Religion, is, That Su|per&s;tition is an Enemy to Civil Liberty, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m a Friend to it. As Super&s;tition groans under the Dominion of the Prie&s;ts, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m is an Enemy to all Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Power, this &s;ufficiently accounts for the pre&s;ent Ob&s;ervation. Not to mention, that Enthu&s;ia&s;m, being the Infirmity of bold and
<PB N="150" REF="152">
ambitious Tempers, is naturally accompanied with a Spirit of Liberty; as Super&s;tition, on the contrary, renders Men tame and abject, and fits them for Slavery. We learn from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, that, during the Civil Wars, the <HI>Independents</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t op|po&s;ite in their religious Principles; yet were united in their political Ones, and were alike pa&s;&s;ionate for a Commonwealth. And &s;ince the Origin of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> the Leaders of the <HI>VVhigs</HI> have either been <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> or profe&s;t <HI>Latudinarians</HI> in their Principles; that is, Friends to Toleration, and indifferent to any particular Sect of <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> While the Sec|taries, who have all a &s;trong Tincture of En|thu&s;ia&s;m, have always, without Exception, concurr'd with that Party, in the Defence of Civil Liberty. The Re&s;emblance in their Su|per&s;titions long united the High-Church <HI>Tories</HI> and the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> in the Support of Prerogative and Kingly Power; tho' Experi|ence of the tolerating Spirit of the <HI>VVhigs</HI> &s;eems of late to have reconcil'd the <HI>Catholics</HI> to that Party.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Molini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> in <HI>France</HI> have a Thou&s;and unintelligible Di&s;putes, which are
<PB N="151" REF="153">
not worthy the Attention of a Man of Sen&s;e: But what principally di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e two Sects, and alone merits our Attention, is the different Spirit of their Religion. The <HI>Moli|ni&s;ts,</HI> conducted by the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> are great Friends to Super&s;tition, rigid Ob&s;ervers of external Forms and Ceremonies, and devoted to the Authority of the Prie&s;ts, and to Tradi|tion.

<HEAD>ESSAY XIII. Of AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, That Comic Wri|ters exaggerate every Character, and draw their Fop or Coward, with &s;tronger Features than are a|ny where to be met with in Nature. This moral kind of Painting for the Stage has been often compar'd to the Painting for Cupolas and Ceilings, where the Colours are over|charg'd, and every Part is drawn exce&s;&s;ively large, and beyond Nature. The Figures &s;eem mon&s;trous and di&s;proportion'd, when &s;een too nigh; but become natural and regular, when &s;et at a Di&s;tance, and placed in that Point of View, in which they are intended to be &s;ur|vey'd. After the &s;ame manner, when Cha|racters are exhibited in theatrical Repre&s;enta|tions, the Want of Reality &s;ets the Per&s;onages at a Di&s;tance from us; and rendering them
<PB N="154" REF="155">
more cold and unentertaining, makes it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to compen&s;ate, by the Force of Colour|ing, what they want in Sub&s;tance. Thus, we find in common Life, That when a Man once allows him&s;elf to depart from Truth in his Narrations, he never can keep within the Bounds of Probability; but adds &s;till &s;ome new Circum&s;tance to render his Stories more marvellous, and &s;atisfy his Imagination. Two Men in Buckram Suits became eleven to Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff</HI> before the End of his Story.</P>
<P>THERE is only one Vice, which may be found in Life with as &s;trong Features, and as high a Colouring, as need be employ'd by a|ny Satyri&s;t or Comic Poet; and that is AVA|RICE. Every Day we meet with Men of im|men&s;e Fortunes, without Heirs, and on the very Brink of the Grave, who refu&s;e them|&s;elves the mo&s;t common Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and go on heaping Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, under all the real Pre&s;&s;ures of the &s;evere&s;t Po|verty. An old U&s;urer, &s;ays the Story, lying in his la&s;t Agonies, was pre&s;ented by the Prie&s;t with the Crucifix to wor&s;hip. He o|pens his Eyes a Moment before he expires, con&s;iders the Crucifix, and cries, <HI>The&s;e Jewels</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="156">
<HI>are not true; I can only lend ten Pi&s;toles upon &s;uch a Pledge.</HI> This was probably the Inven|tion of &s;ome Epigrammati&s;t; and yet every one, from his own Experience, may be able to recollect almo&s;t as &s;trong In&s;tances of Per|&s;everance in Avarice. 'Tis commonly repor|ted of a famous Mi&s;er in this City, that find|ing him&s;elf near Death, he &s;ent for &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates, and gave them a Bill of an hundred Pounds, payable after his Decea&s;e; which Sum he intended &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of in charitable U&s;es; but &s;carce were they gone, when he orders them to be called back, and offers them ready Money, if they would abate five Pounds of the Sum. Another noted Mi|&s;er in the North, intending to defraud his Heirs, and leave his Fortune to the Building an Ho&s;pital, protracted the drawing of his Will from Day to Day; and 'tis thought, that if tho&s;e intere&s;ted in it had not paid for the Drawing of it, he would have died in|te&s;tate. In &s;hort, none of the mo&s;t furious Exce&s;&s;es of Love and Ambition are in any re|&s;pect to be compared to the Extremes of A|varice.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">
THE be&s;t Excu&s;e that can be made for A|varice is, That it generally prevails in old Men, or in Men of cold Tempers, where all the other Affections are extinct; and the Mind being incapable of remaining without &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion or Pur&s;uit, at la&s;t finds out this mon|&s;trous unrea&s;onable one, which &s;uits the Cold|ne&s;s and Inactivity of its Temper. At the &s;ame Time, it &s;eems very extraordinary, that &s;o fro&s;ty &s;piritle&s;s a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd be able to car|ry us farther than all the Warmth of Youth and Plea&s;ure. But if we look more narrowly into the Matter, we &s;hall find, that this very Circum&s;tance renders the Explication of the Ca&s;e more ea&s;y. When the Temper is warm, and full of Vigour, it naturally &s;hoots out more Ways than one, and produces inferior Pa&s;&s;ions to counter-balance, in &s;ome Degree, its predominant Inclination. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Per&s;on of that Temper, however bent on any Pur&s;uit, to be depriv'd of all Sen&s;e of Shame, or Regard to the Sentiments of Man|kind. His Friends mu&s;t have &s;ome Influence over him: And other Con&s;iderations are apt to have their Weight. All this &s;erves to re|&s;train him within &s;ome Bounds. But 'tis no Wonder the avaritious Man being, from the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
Coldne&s;s of his Temper, without regard to Reputation, to Friend&s;hip, or to Plea&s;ure, &s;hou'd be carried &s;o far by his prevailing In|clination, and &s;hou'd di&s;play his Pa&s;&s;ion in &s;uch &s;urprizing In&s;tances.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find no Vice &s;o irre|claimable as Avarice: And tho' there &s;carcely has been a Morali&s;t or Philo&s;opher, from the Beginning of the World to this Day, who has not levell'd a Stroke at it, we hardly find a &s;ingle In&s;tance of any Per&s;on's being cur'd of it. For this Rea&s;on, I am more apt to ap|prove of tho&s;e, who attack it with Wit and Humour, than of tho&s;e who treat it in a &s;e|rious Manner. There being &s;o little Hopes of doing Good to the People infected with this Vice, I would have the re&s;t of Mankind, at lea&s;t, diverted by our Manner of expo&s;ing it: As indeed there is no Kind of Diver&s;ion, of which they &s;eem &s;o willing to partake.</P>
<P>AMONG the Fables of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Motte,</HI> there is one levell'd again&s;t Avarice, which &s;eems to me more natural and ea&s;y, than mo&s;t of the Fables of that ingenious Author. A Mi&s;er, &s;ays he, being dead, and fairly inter|red,
<PB N="158" REF="159">
came to the Banks of the <HI>Styx,</HI> de&s;iring to be ferry'd over along with the other Gho&s;ts. <HI>Charon</HI> demands his Fare, and is &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Mi&s;er, rather than pay it, throw him|&s;elf into the River, and &s;wim over to the o|ther Side, notwith&s;tanding all the Clamour and Oppo&s;ition that cou'd be made to him. All Hell was in an Uproar; and each of the Judges was meditating &s;ome Puni&s;hment, &s;ui|table to a Crime of &s;uch dangerous Con&s;e|quence to the infernal Revenues. Shall he be chain'd to the Rock along with <HI>Prometheus?</HI> Or tremble below the Precipice in Company with the <HI>Dana&iuml;des?</HI> Ora&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Si&s;yphus</HI> in rolling his Stone? No, &s;ays <HI>Minos,</HI> None of the&s;e. We mu&s;t invent &s;ome &s;everer Puni&s;hment. Let him be &s;ent back to the Earth, to &s;ee the U&s;e his Heirs are making of his Riches.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be interpreted as a De|&s;ign of &s;etting my&s;elf in Oppo&s;ition to this fa|mous Author, if I proceed to deliver a Fable of my own, which is intended to expo&s;e the &s;ame Vice of Avarice. The Hint of it was taken from the&s;e Lines of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>

OUR old Mother EARTH once laid an Indictment again&s;t AVARICE before the Courts of Heaven, for her wicked and malicious Coun&s;el and Advice, in tempting, inducing, per&s;wading, and traiterou&s;ly &s;educing the Chil|dren of the Plaintiff to commit the dete&s;table Crime of Parricide upon her, and mangling her Body, in ran&s;acking her very Bowels for hid|den Trea&s;ure.

<P>THERE are certain Sects, which &s;e|cretly form them&s;elves in the lear|ned World, as well as in the poli|tical; and tho' &s;ometimes they come not to an open Rupture, yet they give a different Turn to the Ways of thinking of tho&s;e who have taken Party on either Side. The mo&s;t remark|able of this Kind are the Sects, that are found|ed on the different Sentiments, with regard to the <HI>Dignity of human Nature;</HI> which is a Point, that &s;eems to have divided Philo&s;ophers and Poets, as well as Divines, from the Be|ginning of the World to this Day. Some ex|alt our Species to the Skies, and repre&s;ent Man as a Kind of human Demi-God, that de|rives his Origin from Heaven, and retains e|vident

If an Author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Talent of Rhetoric, and Declamation, he commonly takes Party with the former: If his Turn lies towards Irony and Ridicule, he naturally throws him&s;elf into the other Extreme.</P>
<P>I AM far from thinking, that all tho&s;e, who have depreciated Human Nature, have been Enemies to Virtue, and have expo&s;ed the Frail|ties of their Fellow-Creatures with any bad Intention. On the contrary, I am &s;en&s;ible, that a very delicate Sen&s;e of Virtue, e&s;pecially when attended with &s;omewhat of the <HI>Mi&s;an|thrope,</HI> is apt to give a Man a Di&s;gu&s;t of the World, and to make him con&s;ider the com|mon Cour&s;e of Human Affairs with too much Spleen and Indignation. I mu&s;t, however, be of Opinion, that the Sentiments of tho&s;e, who are inclined to think favourably of Man|kind, are much more advantageous to Virtue, than the contrary Principles, which give us a mean Opinion of our Nature. When a Man
<PB N="163" REF="164">
is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a high Notion of his Rank and Character in the Creation, he will naturally endeavour to act up to it, and will &s;corn to do a ba&s;e or vicious Action, which might &s;ink him below that Figure, which he makes in his own Imagination. Accordingly we find, That all our polite and fa&s;hionable Morali&s;ts in|&s;i&s;t upon this Topic, and endeavour to repre|&s;ent Vice as unworthy of Man, as well as o|dious in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WOMEN are generally much more flatter'd in their Youth than Men; which may proceed from this Rea&s;on, among others, that their chief Point of Honour is con&s;ider'd as much more difficult than ours, and requires to be &s;upported by all that decent Pride, which can be in&s;till'd into them.</P>
<P>WE find very few Di&s;putes, that are not founded on &s;ome Ambiguity in the Expre&s;&s;ion; and I am per&s;waded, that the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute concerning the Dignity of Human Nature is not more exempt from it than any other. It may, therefore, be worth while to con&s;ider, what is real, and what is only verbal, in this Controver&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
THAT there is a natural Difference betwixt Merit and Demerit, Virtue and Vice, Wi&s;dom and Folly, no rea&s;onable Man will deny: But yet 'tis evident, that in affirming the Term, which denotes either our Approbation or Blame, we are commonly more influenced by Compari&s;on than by any fixt unalterable Stan|dard in the Nature of Things. In like man|ner, Quantity, and Exten&s;ion, and Bulk, are by every one acknowledg'd to be real Things: But when we call any Animal <HI>great</HI> or <HI>little,</HI> we always form a &s;ecret Compari&s;on betwixt that Animal and others of the &s;ame Species; and 'tis that Compari&s;on which regulates our Judgment concerning its Greatne&s;s. A Dog and a Hor&s;e may be of the very &s;ame Size, while the one is admir'd for the Greatne&s;s of its Bulk, and the other for the Smallne&s;s. When I am pre&s;ent, therefore, at any Di&s;pute, I al|ways con&s;ider with my&s;elf, whether or not it be a Que&s;tion merely of Compari&s;on, that is the Subject of the Di&s;pute; and if it be, whether the Di&s;putants compare the &s;ame Objects toge|ther, or talk of Things, that are widely diffe|rent.

<P>IN forming our Notions of Human Nature, we are very apt to make a Compari&s;on be|twixt Men and Animals, which are the only Creatures endowed with Thought that fall under our Sen&s;es. Certainly this Compari&s;on is very favourable to Mankind. On the one hand we &s;ee a Creature, who&s;e Thoughts are not limited by any narrow Bounds either of Place or Time; who carries his Re&s;earches into the mo&s;t di&s;tant Regions of this Globe, and be|yond this Globe, to the Planets and Heavenly Bodies; looks backward to con&s;ider the fir&s;t O|rigin of Human Race; ca&s;ts his Eyes forward to &s;ee the Influence of his Actions upon Po&s;terity, and the Judgments, that will be form'd of his Character a thou&s;and Years hence. A Crea|ture, that traces Cau&s;es and Effects to a great Length and Intricacy; extracts general Prin|ciples from particular Appearances; improves upon his Di&s;coveries; corrects his Mi&s;takes; and makes his very Errors profitable. On the other hand, we are pre&s;ented with a Creature the very rever&s;e of this; limited in its Ob&s;er|vations and Rea&s;onings to a few &s;en&s;ible Ob|jects
<PB N="166" REF="167">
that &s;urround it; without Curio&s;ity, without Fore&s;ight; blindly conducted by In|&s;tinct, and arriving in a very &s;hort Time at its utmo&s;t Perfection, beyond which it is never able to advance a &s;ingle Step. What a wide Difference is there betwixt the&s;e Creatures! And how exalted a Notion mu&s;t we entertain of the former, in Compari&s;on of the latter!</P>
<P>THERE are two Means commonly employ'd to de&s;troy this Conclu&s;ion: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By making an unfair Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e, and in|&s;i&s;ting only upon the Weakne&s;&s;es of Human Nature. And <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> By forming a new and &s;ecret Compari&s;on betwixt Man and Beings of the mo&s;t perfect Wi&s;dom. Among the other Excellencies of Man, there is this remarkable, that he can form a Notion of Perfections much beyond what he has Experience of in him&s;elf; and is not limited in his Conception of Wi&s;|dom and Virtue. He can ea&s;ily exalt his No|tions, and conceive a Degree of Wi&s;dom, which, when compar'd to his own, will make the latter appear very contemptible, and will cau&s;e the Difference betwixt that and the Sa|gacity of Animals, in a manner, to di&s;appear and vani&s;h. Now this being a Point, in which
<PB N="167" REF="168">
all the World is agreed, that Human Under|&s;tanding falls infinitely &s;hort of perfect Wi&s;|dom, 'tis proper we &s;hould know when this Compari&s;on takes Place, that we may not di&s;|pute where there is no real Difference in our Sentiments. Man falls much more &s;hort of perfect Wi&s;dom, and even of his own Ideas of perfect Wi&s;dom, than Animals do of Man; but yet the latter Difference is &s;o con&s;ide|rable, that nothing but a Compari&s;on with the former, can make it appear of little Mo|ment.</P>
<P>'TIS al&s;o very u&s;ual to <HI>compare</HI> one Man with another; and finding very few, that we can call <HI>wi&s;e</HI> or <HI>virtuous,</HI> we are apt to enter|tain a contemptible Notion of our Species in general. That we may be &s;en&s;ible of the Fal|lacy of this Way of Rea&s;oning, we may ob|&s;erve, that the Honourable Appellations of wi&s;e and virtuous, are not annex'd to any par|ticular Degree of tho&s;e Qualities of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue;</HI> but ari&s;e altogether from the Compari&s;on we make betwixt one Man and another. When we find a Man, who arrives at &s;uch a Pitch of Wi&s;dom as is very uncom|mon, we pronounce him a wi&s;e Man: So that
<PB N="168" REF="169">
to &s;ay, there are few wi&s;e Men in the World, is really to &s;ay nothing; &s;ince 'tis only by their Scarcity that they merit that Appellati|on. Were the lowe&s;t of our Species as wi&s;e as <HI>Tully,</HI> or my Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> we &s;hould &s;till have Rea&s;on to &s;ay, that there are few wi&s;e Men. For in that Ca&s;e we &s;hould exalt our Notions of Wi&s;dom, and wou'd not pay a &s;ingular Honour to any one, that was not &s;in|gularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by his Talents. In like Manner, I have heard it ob&s;erv'd by thought|le&s;s People, that there are few Women po&s;|&s;e&s;t of Beauty, in Compari&s;on of tho&s;e who want it; not con&s;idering, that we be&s;tow the Epithet of <HI>Beautiful</HI> only on &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s a Degree of Beauty, that is common to them with a few. The &s;ame Degree of Beauty in a Woman is call'd Deformity, which is trea|ted as real Beauty in one of our Sex.</P>
<P>AS 'tis u&s;ual, in forming a Notion of our Species, to <HI>compare</HI> it with the other Species above or below it, or to compare the Indivi|duals of the Species among them&s;elves; &s;o we often compare together the different Motives or actuating Principles of Human Nature, in order to regulate our Judgment concerning
<PB N="169" REF="170">
it. And indeed, this is the only Kind of Compari&s;on, that is worth our Attention, or decides any Thing in the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion. Were the &s;elfi&s;h and vicious Principles of Hu|man Nature &s;o much predominant above the Social and Virtuous, as is a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, we ought undoubtedly to enter|tain a contemptible Notion of Human Na|ture. I may, perhaps, treat more fully of this Subject in &s;ome future Speculation. In the mean Time, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, what has been prov'd beyond Que&s;tion by &s;everal great Morali&s;ts of the pre&s;ent Age, that the &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions are by far the mo&s;t powerful of any, and that even all the other Pa&s;&s;ions receive their Force and Influence from them. Who|ever de&s;ires to &s;ee this Que&s;tion treated at large, with the greate&s;t Force of Argument and Eloquence, may con&s;ult my Lord <HI>Shafts|bury</HI>'s Enquiry concerning Virtue.</P>
<P>IN my Opinion, there are two Things, which have led a&s;tray tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, that have in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much on the Selfi&s;hne&s;s of Man. In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Place, they found, that e|very Act of Virtue or Friend&s;hip was attended with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure: From whence they
<PB N="170" REF="171">
concluded, that Friend&s;hip and Virtue could not be di&s;intere&s;ted. But the Fallacy of this is obvious. The virtuous Sentiment or Pa&s;|&s;ion produces the Plea&s;ure, and does not ari&s;e from it. I feel a Plea&s;ure in doing good to my Friend, becau&s;e I love him; but do not love him for the &s;ake of that Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, it has always been found, that virtuous Men are far from being indiffe|rent to Prai&s;e; and therefore they have been repre&s;ented as a Set of vain-glorious Men, that had nothing in View but the Applau&s;es of o|thers. But this al&s;o is a Fallacy. 'Tis very unju&s;t in the World, when they find any Tincture of Vanity in a laudable Action, to depreciate it upon that Account, or a&s;cribe it entirely to that Motive. The Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with Vanity, as with other Pa&s;&s;ions. Where Avarice or Revenge enters into any &s;eemingly virtuous Action, 'tis difficult for us to determine how far it enters, and 'tis natu|ral to &s;uppo&s;e it the &s;ole actuating Principle. But Vanity is &s;o nearly ally'd to Virtue, and to love the Fame of virtuous Actions approaches &s;o near the Love of virtuous Actions for their own &s;ake, that the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are more capa|ble
<PB N="171" REF="172">
of Mixture, than any other kinds of Pa&s;|&s;ion; and 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have the latter without &s;ome Degree of the former. Accordingly we find, that this Pa&s;&s;ion for Glory is always warp'd and varied according to the particular Ta&s;te or Sentiment of the Mind on which it falls. <HI>Nero</HI> had the &s;ame Vanity in driving a Chariot, that <HI>Trajan</HI> had in governing the Empire with Ju&s;tice and A|bility. To love the Glory of virtuous Acti|ons is a &s;ure Proof of the Love of virtuous Actions.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XV. Of LIBERTY and DESPOTISM.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who employ their Pens on political Subjects, free from Party-Rage, and Party-Prejudices, culti|vate a Science, which, of all others, contri|butes mo&s;t both to public Utility, and to the private Satisfaction of tho&s;e who addict them|&s;elves to the Study of it. I am apt, however, to entertain a Su&s;picion, that the World is &s;till too young to fix any general &s;table Truths in Politics, which will remain true to the late&s;t Po&s;terity. We have not as yet had Experi|ence of above three thou&s;and Years; &s;o that not only the Art of Rea&s;oning is &s;till defective in this Science, as well as in all others, but we even want &s;ufficient Materials, upon which we can rea&s;on. 'Tis not &s;ufficiently known, what Degrees of Refinement, either in Virtue
<PB N="174" REF="174">
or Vice, human Nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of; nor what may be expected of Mankind from any great Revolution in their Education, Cu&s;toms, or Principles. <HI>Machiavel</HI> was certainly a great Genius; but having confin'd his Study to the furious Tyranny of <HI>antient</HI> Sovereigns, or the little di&s;orderly Principalities of <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> his Rea&s;onings, e&s;pecially upon Monar|chical Government, have been found ex|tremely defective; and there &s;carce is any Maxim in his <HI>Prince,</HI> which &s;ub&s;equent Expe|rience has not entirely refuted. <HI>A weak So|vereign,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is incapable of receiving good Coun&s;el; for if he con&s;ult with &s;everal, he will not be able to choo&s;e among their different Coun|&s;els. If he abandon him&s;elf to one, that Mi|ni&s;ter may, perhaps, have Capacity; but he will not be long a Mini&s;ter: He will be &s;ure to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s his Ma&s;ter, and place him&s;elf and his own Family upon the Throne.</HI> I mention this, among innumerable In&s;tances, of the Er|rors of that Politician, proceeding from his having liv'd in too early an Age of the World, to be a good Judge of political Truth. Al|mo&s;t all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are at pre&s;ent go|verned by their Mini&s;ters, and have been &s;o for near two Centuries; and yet no &s;uch Event
<PB N="175" REF="175">
has ever happen'd, or can po&s;&s;ibly happen. <HI>Sejanus</HI> might project the dethroning the <HI>Cae|&s;ars;</HI> but <HI>Fleury,</HI> though ever &s;o vicious, could not, while in his Sen&s;es, entertain the lea&s;t Hopes of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the <HI>Bourbons.</HI></P>
<P>TRADE was never e&s;teem'd an Affair of State, 'till within this la&s;t Century; nor is there any antient Writer on Politics, who has made mention of it. Even the <HI>Italians</HI> have kept a profound Silence with regard to it; though it has now excited the chief Attention, as well of Mini&s;ters of State, as of &s;pecula|tive Rea&s;oners. The great Opulence, Gran|deur, and military Archievements of the two Maritime Powers, &s;eem fir&s;t to have in&s;tructed Mankind in the va&s;t Importance of an exten|&s;ive Commerce.</P>
<P>HAVING, therefore, intended in this E&s;&s;ay to have made a full Compari&s;on of Liberty and De&s;poti&s;m, and have &s;hown the Advantages and Di&s;advantages of each, I began to entertain a Su&s;picion, that no Man in this Age was &s;uffi|ciently qualified for &s;uch an Undertaking, and that whatever he &s;hould advance on that Head would, in all Probability, be refuted by fur|ther
<PB N="176" REF="176">
Experience, and be rejected by Po&s;terity. Such mighty Revolutions have happened in human Affairs, and &s;o many Events have ari&s;en contrary to the Expectation of the antients, as are &s;ufficient to beget the Su&s;picion of &s;till far|ther Changes.</P>
<P>IT had been ob&s;erv'd by the Antients, that all the Arts and Sciences aro&s;e among free Na|tions, and that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all their Ea&s;e, Opulence and Luxury, made but faint Efforts towards a Re|li&s;h in tho&s;e finer Plea&s;ures, which were car|ried to &s;uch Perfection by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> amid&s;t continual Wars, attended with Poverty, and the greate&s;t Simplicity of Life and Manners. It had al&s;o been ob&s;erv'd, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Greeks</HI> lo&s;t their Liberty, tho' they encrea&s;ed mightily in Riches, by Means of the Con|que&s;ts of <HI>Alexander;</HI> yet the Arts, from that Moment, declin'd among them, and have ne|ver &s;ince been able to rai&s;e their Head in that Climate. Learning was tran&s;planted to <HI>Rome,</HI> the only free Nation at that Time in the Uni|ver&s;e; and having met with &s;o favourable a Soil, it made prodigious Shoots for above a Century; till the Decay of Liberty produced
<PB N="177" REF="177">
al&s;o the Decay of Letters, and &s;pread a total Barbarity over the World. From the&s;e two Experiments, of which each was double in its Kind, and &s;how'd the Fall of Learning in De|&s;potic Governments, as well as its Ri&s;e in po|pular Ones, <HI>Longinus</HI> thought him&s;elf &s;uffici|ently ju&s;tified, in a&s;&s;erting, That the Arts and Sciences could never flouri&s;h, but in a free Government: And in this Opinion, he has been followed by &s;everal eminent Writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI></NOTE> in our own Country, who either confin'd their View merely to antient Facts, or enter|tain'd too great a Partiality in Favour of that Form of Government, which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd a|mong&s;t us.</P>
<P>BUT what would the&s;e Writers have &s;aid, to the In&s;tance of modern <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Florence;</HI> of which the former carried to Perfection all the finer Arts of Sculpture, Painting and Mu|&s;ic, as well as Poetry, tho' they groah'd un|der Slavery, and under the Slavery of Prie&s;ts: While the latter never made any Efforts to|wards the Arts and Sciences, till they began to lo&s;e their Liberty by the U&s;urpations of the
<PB N="178" REF="178">
Family of the <HI>Medicis? Ario&s;to, Ta&s;&s;o, Gali|laeo,</HI> no more than <HI>Raphael,</HI> or <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> were not born in Republics. And tho' the <HI>Lombard</HI> School was famous as well as the <HI>Roman,</HI> yet the <HI>Venetians</HI> have had the &s;mal|le&s;t Share in its Honours, and &s;eem rather inferior to the other <HI>Italians,</HI> in their Genius for the Sciences. <HI>Rubens</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd his School at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> not at <HI>Am&s;terdam. Dre&s;den,</HI> not <HI>Hamburg,</HI> is the Centre of Politene&s;s in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t eminent In&s;tance of the flou|ri&s;hing of Learning in de&s;potic Governments, is that of FRANCE, which never enjoy'd any Shadow of Liberty, and yet has carried the Arts and Sciences nearer Perfection than any other Nationa of the Univer&s;e. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are, perhaps, better Philo&s;ophers; the <HI>Itali|ans</HI> better Painters and Mu&s;icians; the <HI>Romans</HI> were better Orators: But the <HI>French</HI> are the only People, except the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who have been at once Philo&s;ophers, Poets, Orators, Hi&s;torians, Painters, Architects, Sculptors and Mu&s;icians. With regard to the Stage, they have far excell'd the <HI>Greeks:</HI> And in com|mon Life, have, in a great Mea&s;ure, perfec|ted
<PB N="179" REF="179">
that Art, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and agreeable of any, <HI>l'Art de Vivre,</HI> the Art of Society and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the State of the Sciences and polite Arts in our own Country, <HI>Horace</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation, with regard to the <HI>Romans,</HI> may, in a great Mea&s;ure, be applied to the <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Sed in longum tamen aevum</L>
<L>Man&s;erunt, hodieque manent <HI>ve&s;tigia ruris.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us. We have no Dictionary of our Language, and &s;carce a tolerable Grammar. The fir&s;t polite Pro&s;e we have, was wrote by a Man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Swift.</HI></NOTE> who is &s;till alive. As to <HI>Sprat, Temple</HI> and <HI>Locke,</HI> they knew too little of the Rules of Art to be e&s;teem'd elegant Writers. The Pro&s;e of <HI>Bacon, Harrington</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> is altogether &s;tiff and pedantic; tho' their Sen&s;e be excel|lent. Men, in this Country, have been &s;o much occupied in the Grand Di&s;putes of <HI>Reli|gion, Politics</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> that they had
<PB N="180" REF="180">
no Reli&s;h for the minute Ob&s;ervations of Grammar and Critici&s;m. And tho' this Turn of Thinking mu&s;t have con&s;iderably improv'd our Sen&s;e and Talent of Rea&s;oning beyond that of other Nations; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that even in the&s;e Sciences, we have not any Standard-Book, which we can tran&s;mit to Po|&s;terity: And the utmo&s;t we have to boa&s;t of, are a few faint Efforts towards a more ju&s;t Philo&s;ophy; which, indeed, promi&s;e very much, but have not, as yet, reach'd any De|gree of Perfection.</P>
<P>IT has become an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Opinion, That Commerce can never flouri&s;h but in a free Go|vernment; and this Opinion &s;eems to have been founded on a longer and larger Experi|ence than the foregoing, with Regard to the Arts and Sciences. If we trace Commerce in its Progre&s;s thro' <HI>Tyre, Athens, Syracu&s;e, Carthage, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Antwerp, Holland, England,</HI> &amp;c. we &s;hall always find it to have fixt its Seat in free Governments. The three greate&s;t trading Towns now in the World, are <HI>London, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and <HI>Ham|burgh;</HI> all free Cities, and Prote&s;tant Cities; that is, enjoying a double Liberty. It mu&s;t,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
however, be ob&s;erv'd, that the great Jealou&s;y entertain'd of late, with regard to the Com|merce of <HI>France,</HI> &s;eems to prove, that this Maxim is no more certain and infallible, than the foregoing, and that the Subjects of ab&s;o|lute Princes may become our Rivals in Com|merce, as well as in Learning.</P>
<P>DURST I deliver my Opinion in an Affair of &s;o much Uncertainty, I would a&s;&s;ert, That, notwith&s;tanding the Efforts of the <HI>French,</HI> there is &s;omething pernicious to Commerce inherent in the very Nature of ab&s;olute Go|vernment, and in&s;eparable from it: Tho' the Rea&s;on I would a&s;&s;ign for this Opinion, is &s;omewhat different from that which is com|monly in&s;i&s;ted on. Private Property &s;eems to me fully as &s;ecure in a civiliz'd <HI>Europaean</HI> Monarchy, as in a Republic; nor is any Dan|ger ever apprehended, in &s;uch a Government, from the Violence of the Sovereign; no more than we commonly apprehend Danger from Thunder, or Earthquakes, or any Accident the mo&s;t unu&s;ual and extraordinary. Ava|rice, the Spur of Indu&s;try, is &s;o ob&s;tinate a Pa&s;&s;ion, and works its Way thro' &s;o many real Dangers and Difficulties, that 'tis not like|ly
<PB N="182" REF="182">
it will be &s;carr'd by an imaginary Danger, which is &s;o &s;mall, that it &s;carce admits of Cal|culation. Commerce, therefore, in my Opi|nion, is apt to decay in ab&s;olute Govern|ments, not becau&s;e it is there le&s;s <HI>&s;ecure,</HI> but becau&s;e it is le&s;s <HI>honourable.</HI> A Subordinati|on of Ranks is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Sup|port of Monarchy. Birth, Titles, and Place, mu&s;t be honour'd above Indu&s;try and Riches. And while the&s;e Notions prevail, all the con|&s;iderable Traders will be tempted to throw up their Commerce, in order to purcha&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e Employments, to which Privi|leges and Honours are annex'd.</P>
<P>SINCE I am upon this Head of the Altera|tions that Time has produc'd, or may pro|duce in Politics, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That all Kinds of Government, free and de&s;potic, &s;eem to have undergone, in modern Times, a great Change to the better, with regard both to fo|reign and dome&s;tic Management. The <HI>Ba|lance of Power</HI> is a Secret in Politics known only to the pre&s;ent Age; and I mu&s;t add, That the internal POLICE of the State has al&s;o receiv'd great Improvements within this la&s;t Century. We are inform'd by <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> That
<PB N="183" REF="183">
<HI>Cataline</HI>'s Army was much augmented by the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Highway-men about <HI>Rome;</HI> tho' I believe, that all of that Profe&s;&s;ion, who are at pre&s;ent di&s;pers'd over <HI>Europe,</HI> would not amount to a Regiment. In <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Plead|ings for <HI>Milo,</HI> I find this Argument, among others, made U&s;e of to prove, that his Client had not a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated <HI>Clodius.</HI> Had <HI>Milo,</HI> &s;ays he, intended to have kill'd <HI>Clodius,</HI> he had not attack'd him in the Day-time, and at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from the City: He had Way-laid him at Night, near the Suburbs, where it might have been pretended, that he was kill'd by Robbers; and the Frequency of the Acci|dent would have favour'd the Deceit. This is a &s;urprizing Proof of the loo&s;e Police of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of the Number and Force of the&s;e Robbers; &s;ince <HI>Clodius,</HI> as we learn from the &s;ame Oration, was at that Time attended with Sixty Slaves, who were compleatly arm'd, and, by the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, an&s;werable, upon their own Lives, for the Life of their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all Kinds of Government be much improv'd in modern Times, yet Monarchical Government &s;eems to have receiv'd the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Improvements. It may now be
<PB N="284" REF="184">
affirm'd of civiliz'd Monarchies, what was formerly &s;aid in Prai&s;e of Republics alone, <HI>that they are a Government of Laws, not of Men.</HI> They are found &s;u&s;ceptible of Order, Method, and Con&s;tancy, to a &s;urprizing De|gree. Property is &s;ecure; Indu&s;try encou|rag'd; the Arts flouri&s;h; and the Prince lives &s;ecure among his Subjects, like a Father a|mong his Children. It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;t, that tho' Monarchical Governments have approach'd nearer to popular Ones, in Gentlene&s;s and Stability; yet they are &s;till much inferior. Our modern Education and Cu&s;toms in&s;til more Humanity and Modera|tion than the antient; but have not as yet been able to overcome entirely the Di&s;advan|tages of that Form of Government.</P>
<P>BUT here I mu&s;t beg leave to advance a Con|jecture, which &s;eems to me very probable, but which Po&s;terity alone can fully judge of. I am apt to think, that in Monarchical Go|vernments there is a Source of Improvement, and in Popular Governments a Source of De|generacy, which in Time will bring the&s;e Spe|cies of Government &s;till nearer an Equality. The greate&s;t Abu&s;es, which ari&s;e in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="185">
the mo&s;t perfect Model of pure Monarchy, proceed not from the Number or Weight of the Taxes, beyond what are to be met with in free Countries; but from the Expen&s;ive, unequal, arbitrary, and intricate Method of levying them, by which the Indu&s;try of the Poor, e&s;pecially of the Pea&s;ants and Farmers, is, in a great Mea&s;ure, di&s;courag'd, and Agri|culture render'd a beggarly and a &s;lavi&s;h Em|ployment. But to who&s;e Advantage do the&s;e Abu&s;es &s;erve? If to that of the Nobility, they might be e&s;teem'd inherent in that Form of Government; &s;ince the Nobility are the true Supports of Monarchy; and 'tis natural their Intere&s;t &s;hould be more con&s;ulted, in &s;uch a Con&s;titution, than that of the People. But the Nobility are, in reality, the principal Lo&s;ers by this Oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;ince it ruins their E&s;tates, and beggars their Tenants. The only Gainers by it are the <HI>Finan&ccedil;iers,</HI> a Race of Men de|&s;pi&s;ed and hated by the Nobility and the whole Kingdom. If a Prince or Mini&s;ter, therefore, &s;hould ari&s;e, endow'd with &s;ufficient Di&s;cern|ment to know his own and the public Inte|re&s;t, and of &s;ufficient Force of Mind to break thro' antient Cu&s;toms, we may expect to &s;ee the&s;e Abu&s;es remedied; in which Ca&s;e, the
<PB N="186" REF="186">
Difference betwixt their ab&s;olute Government and our free one, would be more nominal than real.</P>
<P>The Source of Degeneracy, that may be re|mark'd in free Governments, con&s;i&s;ts in the Practice of contracting Debt, and mortaging the public Revenues, by which Taxes may, in Time, become altogether intolerable, and all the Property of the State be brought into the Hands of the Public.
