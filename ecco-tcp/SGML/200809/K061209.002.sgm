<HEAD>LETTER XIII. <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> HARRIOT BEAUCLERK <HI>to Mi&s;s</HI> LOUISA MILDMAY.</HEAD>
<P>O! my &s;weet friend, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, are our &s;orrows never to have an end; and is every day that &s;hould mitigate the &s;everity of our for|tune, to bring us nothing but an aggra|vation of di&s;tre&s;s! Your poor brother&mdash;I cannot keep it from you&mdash;was a few hours ago brought to us de&s;perately
<PB N="2" REF="4">
wounded by that barbarous villain Harold, with whom he accidentally met at the Crown in Reading; and there, with more courage than di&s;cretion called to an account for his infamous be|haviour to the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t worthy of her &s;ex. Pi&s;tols were the cur&s;ed weapons they fought with, and your brother received a &s;hot a little above the groin; the ball was extracted by an eminent &s;urgeon at Reading, and the colonel was brought home in a litter, as the phy&s;icians judged it better to remove him even &s;uch a number of miles, than to let him remain in any place where he could not have proper accommodations.</P>
<P>Your poor mother, when &s;he &s;aw him borne in, fainted away, and was imme|diately removed to her own apartment; where, after applying the nece&s;&s;ary re|&s;toratives, we happily recovered her;
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;he then told me that this was nothing more than what &s;he expected, and that &s;he was the le&s;s affected at the &s;hock as &s;he had rendered it continually familiar to her imagination&mdash;"Yet, Mi&s;s Beauclerk," continued the venerable lady,
<Q>it is a &s;evere &s;troke, though an expected one; but God's will be done.</Q>
A large tear then rolled down her fine face, which &s;he endeavoured to re&s;train, as &s;he &s;aw how much I was touched with the general misfortune; after this, &s;he &s;ent for the &s;urgeon, and doctor, who attended the colonel, from Reading, and begged they would give her their candid opinion of his &s;ituation.&mdash;
<Q>Don't be afraid to tell me gentlemen,</Q>
&s;ays &s;he, endeavouring at a &s;mile;
<Q>for, though I have all the tenderne&s;s of a mother, I hope I al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s the re&s;ignation of a Chri&s;tian.</Q>
The gentlemen looked at one another in admiration both of her piety and her fortitude, and
<PB N="4" REF="6">
very freely owned that the colonel was in &s;ome danger; but that they were ne|verthele&s;s in hopes, if they could pre|vent a fever, to &s;ee him tolerably re|covered in a little time. The gentlemen then preparing to withdraw, I whi&s;pered the doctor to feel her own pul&s;e, which he did in a very re&s;pectful manner, and advi&s;ed her to loo&s;e a few ounces of blood: &s;he a&s;&s;ented to the motion; and the doctor at going out gave me a look of benignity for my recollection, that indicated a goodne&s;s of heart in him&s;elf, which has rai&s;ed him not a little in my e&s;timation. After your mother had been bled, we prevailed upon her to lye down, and I left her ju&s;t now in a &s;weet doze, which I flatter my&s;elf will do her a world of benefit.</P>
<P>As my attention at your brother's fir&s;t coming in was called off by your mo|ther's di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;ent for Butler, his Iri&s;h
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;ervant, who is principally employed about his per&s;on, to be informed of par|ticulars&mdash;The poor fellow, though deep|ly affected for his ma&s;ter's accident, told me he &s;hould ever love and honour his old ma&s;ter, for bearing up &s;o like a man again&s;t the &s;troke of misfortune&mdash;"Madam," &s;ays he,
<Q>in&s;tead of ex|claiming, as the generality of father's would have done on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and cen&s;uring the ra&s;hne&s;s of his &s;on, he took hold of my ma&s;ter's hand, ki&s;&s;ed it with an air of inconceiveable &s;atisfaction, and prai&s;ed him for the attention which he had &s;hewn to the honour of his family: the only regret he te&s;tified, was at hearing that the per&s;on who had injured his honour was not hurt in the engagement; for, had he fallen, &s;ays my old ma&s;ter, that would have been a great &s;atisfac|tion&mdash;And &s;o it would you know madam,</Q>
continued the hone&s;t Hi|bernian,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
&mdash;
<Q>The honour of a good family is a very nice affair; I am come of as good a family my&s;elf as any in Ireland, and know how to feel for &s;uch a misfortune as has happened to my ma&s;ter's.</Q></P>
<P>Though I could not help &s;miling at the egoti&s;m of poor Butler, I neverthele&s;s de&s;ired him to an&s;wer my que&s;tions, and not teaze me with his reflections: he therefore proceeded to inform me that your father and brother were both more than ever incen&s;ed again&s;t Harold, and that your brother had &s;olemnly &s;wore to call him to a &s;econd account the moment he recovered from the pre|&s;ent accident; that your father, however, had been forced out of the room from the colonel, as talking did much injury to the latter; and that the old gentleman, upon withdrawing, &s;aid &s;omething about altering his will; Butler added, that
<PB N="7" REF="9">
your brother de&s;ired a vi&s;it from me above all things, and he believed would reque&s;t a favour of that kind if he was any way better in the morning.</P>
<P>You conjure me by all our friend&s;hip, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, to give you a minute account of every thing; to mitigate no de&s;cription, and to conceal no di&s;tre&s;s; I obey you, though again&s;t my inclina|nation, as I know how a &s;en&s;ibility like your's mu&s;t be wounded by a repetition of &s;ome circum&s;tances; but my &s;weet, my ever amiable friend, exert your ut|mo&s;t re&s;olution, and prepare to meet tho&s;e evils with fortitude, which are impo&s;&s;ible to be avoided&mdash;True mag|nanimity is never &s;een till the day of di&s;tre&s;s, and tho&s;e have naturally the noble&s;t minds who make the firme&s;t &s;tand again&s;t affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">From &s;ome things which have e&s;caped your brother &s;ince I wrote the foregoing part of this letter, I have rea&s;on to imagine that Sir Robert Harold was not altogether &s;o much in fault, in the late rencounter, as we were inclined to imagine: colonel Mildmay him&s;elf acknowledges, that he u&s;ed every provocation before he could prevail upon the baronet to engage; and he even intimates, that Sir Robert was actually going to town with an intention of throwing him&s;elf at your feet, and imploring your forgivene&s;s&mdash;If this was the ca&s;e, it was certainly ra&s;h in the colonel to carry matters to &s;uch an ex|tremity; he ought to con&s;ider that the happine&s;s of more people than one is dependent upon his welfare, and that the hazarding of his life may increa&s;e the general misfortune, but can never have the &s;malle&s;t tendency to remove it: but he has too nice a &s;en&s;ibility for his own ea&s;e, and is frequently running
<PB N="9" REF="11">
into real ills to avoid imaginary mi&s;|fortunes. You know, my dear, my par|tiality for your brother; and you al&s;o know that, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, pru|dence will not allow me to give &s;uch a loo&s;e to my feelings as I &s;hould naturally &s;hew, were we on &s;uch a footing as you have frequently wi&s;hed us&mdash;Perhaps, it may be &s;omething of this very parti|ality which induces me to wi&s;h, that, in the cour&s;e of the recent tran&s;action, he had made u&s;e of a little le&s;s &s;pirit, and a little more under&s;tanding. You cannot conceive, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, how it di&s;tre&s;&s;es me to think of his &s;ituation, to find my&s;elf in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, and yet to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeming only a friendly partaker in the common calamity&mdash;This cruel con|&s;traint is too much, and I pine, I &s;icken, I die, for an interview with him, though I am &s;en&s;ible &s;uch a circum&s;tance in his pre&s;ent condition mu&s;t fill me with the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
mo&s;t poignant affliction; hitherto he has never &s;aid a &s;ingle &s;yllable that could furni&s;h a rea&s;onable hope of his con&s;i|dering me with any tenderne&s;s of pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but he has neverthele&s;s been &s;tudious to gain my good opinion, though he has declined to &s;olicit for my love; and I have a &s;trong notion that he intends to be particular the very fir&s;t opportunity: my heart at lea&s;t interprets things in that &s;en&s;e, and who knows&mdash;But my &s;weet Loui&s;a forgive me; how could I po&s;&s;ibly indulge the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of happine&s;s, while you are &s;inking under the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and while the life of the dear youth is at &s;take, on whom my whole happine&s;s &s;o materially depends! O! Loui&s;a, excu&s;e the woman at my heart, which, in &s;pite of my be&s;t efforts, would talk about your brother, though the &s;hare which you know I partake in his danger mu&s;t add in a very con&s;iderable
<PB N="11" REF="13">
degree to your anxiety. If po&s;&s;ible, I will forbear to mention him with regard, that I may avoid wounding &s;o nice a part of your &s;en&s;ibility, &s;ince I am con|&s;cious with what a generous concern you feel for your Harriot, and am but too apprehen&s;ive that this concern will lead you into &s;ome &s;elf accu&s;ations equally injurious to the recovery of your own peace, and the &s;tability of her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, I told you that my mo|ther, upon hearing what an unexpected cloud had overca&s;t the happine&s;s of your family, gave me permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay for a few days with her dear Mrs. Mildmay, tenderly as well as wi&s;ely con&s;idering, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, her venerable friend would naturally want &s;omebody to &s;ooth the angui&s;h of her mind, who was really intere&s;ted in her di&s;tre&s;s. You cannot conceive how kind|ly the worthy lady, your mother, has
<PB N="12" REF="14">
received this little in&s;tance of our attach|ment&mdash;She wept over me when I men|tioned my de&s;ign to remain at Mildmay Hall till my attendance became unnece&s;|&s;ary; and, ardently pre&s;&s;ing me to her bo&s;om, conde&s;cended to ki&s;s my cheek, and called me her true Harriot, her other Loui&s;a&mdash;Ever &s;ince &s;he has ho|noured me with a more than common &s;hare of her confidence; is de&s;irous of being alone with me upon every occa|&s;ion; and you may ea&s;ily conjecture, my ever amiable girl, what &s;ubject princi|pally engro&s;&s;es our conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t this moment &s;he &s;ent for me to her bed&s;ide: having been &s;ome minutes awake, and &s;eeing my fingers marked with ink&mdash;"I &s;uppo&s;e, my love," &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>you have been writing to poor Loui&s;a.</Q>
I replied in the affirmative, and in&s;inuated what a con&s;olation it would be to you, if you were honoured
<PB N="13" REF="15">
with her remembrance.
<Q>My dear Mi&s;s Beauclerk,</Q>
returned &s;he,
<Q>have not I already told you, that &s;he is &s;till my child; that &s;he even may write to me if &s;he plea&s;es, and that I &s;hall always con&s;ider her unhappy fall with a much greater &s;hare of pity than re|&s;entment? To be candid with you, my obliging love,</Q>
continued the dear lady,
<Q>I am more to be blamed for leaving Sir Robert Harold and Loui&s;a &s;o frequently together, than either is for abu&s;ing the confidence which I repo&s;ed in their di&s;cretion. Young people, where they tenderly love each other, and where a day is &s;et apart for their marriage, are very dangerous companions; the woman lo&s;es all her fear, and the man all his veneration; they become in&s;en&s;ibly more and more familiar, till their imaginations are inten&s;ely heated, and their recollection totally lo&s;t&mdash;In &s;uch
<PB N="14" REF="16">
a &s;ituation, the con&s;equence is but too obvious; the woman wakes into di|&s;traction, and the man into doubt or di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;She trembles for his con|&s;tancy, and he fears for her virtue; recriminations naturally en&s;ue, and they either go to the altar with &s;enti|ments very little calculated to pre&s;erve their future felicity, or break off in &s;uch a manner as draws a general di&s;grace upon the woman and her fa|mily. O! Mi&s;s Beauclerk, why did'nt I con&s;ider this matter with propri|ety, when &s;uch a con&s;ideration would have been e&s;&s;ential to my happine&s;s! Why would I expo&s;e the darling of my heart to dangers which it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for her to avoid; or en&s;nare the inexperience of my child with unece&s;&s;ary temptations&mdash;But, alas, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> &s;he was <HI>my</HI> child, I mu&s;t fooli&s;hly &s;uppo&s;e her above the reach of human infirmities, and be guilty
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of an inattention in my own conduct, which I would have &s;everely cen&s;ured in the mother of any body el&s;e. O! my &s;weet Loui&s;a, your doating mo|ther's extravagant fondne&s;s has been the cau&s;e of all our calamities; and your indi&s;cretion was nothing more than the natural re&s;ult of her mi&s;taken partiality.</Q></P>
<P>In this manner, my beautiful friend, did the generous minded lady proceed, while my tears could only te&s;tify the warmth of my approbation. She was plea&s;ed to &s;ee me touched; and, more than once ki&s;&s;ing away the drops from my cheeks, declared &s;he was never &s;orry to &s;ee a young lady mi&s;erable at a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, becau&s;e tho&s;e only could con|tinue unmov'd, who were utterly de&s;ti|tute of humanity and under&s;tanding&mdash;Your father came in about this time; and &s;eeing both our eyes red, a&s;&s;igned,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
in the fury of his re&s;entment, a very dif|ferent cau&s;e from the real one.&mdash;
<Q>What do you cry for, my dear?</Q>
&s;ays he to your venerable mother,
<Q>If the villain, who has brought all this affliction upon our heads is not yet &s;acrificed, be &s;atisfied that ju&s;tice &s;hall overtake him in the end; for I have a gallant boy &s;till living, who &s;hall pur&s;ue him with uncea&s;ing vengeance till he has wa&s;hed away the di&s;grace of our family in his blood: O! had the inho&s;pitable mon|&s;ter but fallen to day, how light &s;hould I have made of my &s;on's misfortune; but he &s;hall yet feel me&mdash;By the great God of heaven and earth he &s;hall; and &s;o, my dear, be pacified.</Q></P>
<P>"O! Mr. Mildmay," replied your mother,
<Q>too much blood has been &s;pilled already; and, if &s;omething which I have ca&s;ually heard from Mi&s;s Beauclerk, of Sir Robert's repentance,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
be true, I mu&s;t &s;ay that it would be much better to think of an accom|modation than to expo&s;e our&s;elves to any additional &s;hare of di&s;tre&s;s; lady Haver&s;ham is an excellent woman, and I have &s;trong rea&s;on to imagine, that her influence will have every weight we could wi&s;h with the thoughtle&s;s young man, her brother; &s;uffer me, therefore, my dear, to make an enquiry into the foundation of Mi&s;s Beauclerk's intelligence, that if we find&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Find what, madam!" (interrupted your father, with an uncommon degree of vehemence)
<Q>You would not &s;urely have the di&s;honour of your family pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, nor think of receiv|ing a villain as your &s;on-in-law, who has covered you with the mo&s;t infa|mous di&s;grace! Would you give your daughter to a ruffian, who has po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="18" REF="20">
murdered your &s;on; or would you ba&s;ely beg of lady Haver&s;ham to &s;peak a good word for us to her &s;coundrel of a brother? Are we reduced at once &s;o low as to kneel where we have been barbarou&s;ly injured; and mu&s;t we think of &s;upplicating a mon&s;ter for compa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e hands have been equally &s;teeped in our reputation and our blood? Fie, Mrs. Mildmay, fie! this is a language unworthy both of your character and your de&s;cent; and could I find a thought of &s;o di&s;ho|nourable a nature ri&s;ing in my bo&s;om, I &s;hould do in&s;tant ju&s;tice on the traytor, and &s;tab it to the heart.</Q></P>
<P>Your mother made no reply to this but by a &s;hower of tears; which your father being utterly unable to with&s;tand, he flew out of the room, leaving me to give the dear lady what con&s;olation I could, which in fact was but very
<PB N="19" REF="21">
trifling, as I &s;tood in no little need of con&s;olation my&s;elf. Such, my &s;weet friend, is the &s;tate of matters at Mild|may Hall. Your brother, though his wounds pain him con&s;iderably, &s;lept a full hour this evening, &s;o Butler ju&s;t now acquainted me, adding, that he and the &s;urgeon were to &s;it up all night with him; and a&s;&s;uring me that there &s;hould be no want of attendance on ei|ther of their parts.&mdash;"As for my&s;elf," &s;ays Butler,
<Q>I &s;hall have but little in|clination to &s;leep while my poor ma&s;ter continues in any danger; and as for the &s;urgeon, I will take care that he &s;hall wake whenever there is the &s;malle&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q>
So &s;aying, he gave a &s;ignificant look, as if he &s;hould be angry with the gentleman in ca&s;e of any neglect, and marched off to the hou&s;ekeeper for &s;ome old linen to cut up in bandages. You de&s;ired me, at the conclu&s;ion of your letter, to inform
<PB N="20" REF="22">
you, whether there is any other vi&s;itor at the Hall&mdash;It is with plea&s;ure I can acquaint you that there is not. The morning after your departure, me&s;&s;en|gers were &s;ent to every body invited, but my&s;elf, to let them know that an unexpected circum&s;tance had happened, which mu&s;t delay the wedding for &s;ome time; but that they &s;hould receive early intelligence again&s;t the day of celebra|tion. And now, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, let me again in&s;i&s;t that you will bear up with all your fortitude again&s;t the hand of adver&s;ity&mdash;Fortune, believe me, will yet wear a propitious countenance, and we &s;hall all experience a degree of happi|ne&s;s in proportion to the &s;everity of our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. Your mother, my &s;weet girl, on her reverend knees, with &s;tream|ing eyes, and uplifted hands, is this moment ble&s;&s;ing you; &s;uch a woman's prayers to the Throne of Mercy mu&s;t be effectual.&mdash;Providence looks with
<PB N="21" REF="23">
delight upon all parental &s;upplications; but where a parent is peculiarly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for every virtue, the petition is &s;anctified into a kind of claim, and is no &s;ooner pronounced than rewarded. Good night, &s;i&s;ter of my &s;oul, my ever amiable Loui&s;a. By the next po&s;t you &s;hall hear from me again, and I hope infinitely more to your &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>IF I have yet delayed paying my humble&s;t duty to my ever revered mama; if I have yet denied my&s;elf the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of approaching her by letter, it was neither from a want of the deepe&s;t re&s;pect, nor the &s;tronge&s;t inclination.&mdash;But, alas! covered with confu&s;ion and di&s;honour, &s;inking be|neath a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my guilt, and knowing my&s;elf utterly unworthy of her &s;malle&s;t con&s;ideration, I wanted courage to addre&s;s her; and even blu&s;h|ed at my pre&s;umption, when I &s;uppo&s;ed it might be po&s;&s;ible for her to remem|ber a mi&s;erable wretch like me, with any di&s;tant traces of pity or affection&mdash;And, O! my mama, did you really, on your reverend knees, conde&s;cend to beg

<P>The good lady Haver&s;ham, ever &s;ince my arrival in town, has been a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at Mrs. Darnel's, and tries by every means in her power to alleviate the poignancy of my di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;She la|ments the behaviour of her brother with the &s;incere&s;t concern, and has &s;hewn me &s;ome letters from him, which give me rea&s;on to think he is very &s;orry for it him&s;elf, and is de&s;irous of taking every po&s;&s;ible &s;tep to effect a reconcilia|tion; but that, madam, is a matter not to be thought of now&mdash;He has &s;hewn

him&s;elf unworthy of being a &s;on to you and my papa; and, for any thing that &s;hould depend on my determination, could I gain the world by a union with him, or, what is more, could I recover my lo&s;t peace of mind, I &s;hould &s;purn him without he&s;itation, and think it an increa&s;e of my pre&s;ent infamy to retain him a moment in my remembrance&mdash;No, madam, though I have di&s;graced my family by the madne&s;s of one guilty moment, my mind is yet incapable of a premeditated ba&s;ene&s;s; and would &s;corn to vow duty and obedience, where it cannot look without an equal mixture of abhorrence and contempt. You do not know, my dear mama, how very &s;candalous a part he has acted. You do not know with how elaborate a meanne&s;s, with how ingenious a little|ne&s;s, he has behaved in the cour&s;e of this unfortunate tran&s;action; but Mi&s;s Beau|clerk, in a few days, will be able to

<P>Lady Haver&s;ham, madam, was this moment here; &s;he came to me in an ab&s;olute &s;tate of di&s;traction, &s;o that it was a full hour before Mrs. Darnel and I could re&s;tore her to any tollerable &s;hare of tranquility&mdash;She had a letter in her hand directed to Mr. Melmoth, of whom you heard her brother &s;peak &s;o very highly when he was down in the country. This letter, it &s;eems, was a circum&s;tantial account of the unhappy quarrel between my brother and Sir Ro|bert; from which we learn, that the worthle&s;s man was coming after me in
<PB N="29" REF="31">
a great hurry to London, to throw him|&s;elf at my feet, and to implore my for|givene&s;s for his barbarous behaviour. O! that my brother had not &s;een him at Reading; his life had then been en|tirely out of a danger; and I &s;hould have the plea&s;ure at lea&s;t of mortifying his cruel antagoni&s;t with a repul&s;e.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s, when &s;he came a little to her&s;elf, entered into a long conver&s;a|tion with me about the impropriety of refu&s;ing her brother, &s;ince he was now brought to &s;o happy a conviction of his errors, and was attached to me &s;till with &s;o unabating an ardency of affection&mdash;
<Q>I am &s;ure, my dear Loui&s;a,</Q>
argued &s;he,
<Q>notwith&s;tanding you have very great cau&s;e for being offended with him, you have not yet era&s;ed him from your heart; and it would, of con&s;equence, be puni&s;hing your&s;elf, not to think of forgiving him in the end.</Q>
I begged,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
at la&s;t, that her lady&s;hip would &s;ay no more on the &s;ubject; that it pained me exce&s;&s;ively, and that I could never hear her brother's name without reflecting on my own di&s;grace, and the general di&s;honour of my family: &s;he then oblig|ingly waved the di&s;cour&s;e; but &s;aid, that &s;he and Mr. Melmoth were to &s;et off for Mildmay Hall in the morning; and that &s;he hoped to find you and my papa more propitious to her entreaties, than what the ju&s;tice of my re&s;entment would at pre&s;ent &s;uffer me to be; I then only &s;aid, that I had di&s;obliged my papa and mama too much not to wi&s;h for &s;ome opportunity of making an at|tonement; but that the circum&s;tance &s;he hinted at was a method, which I was pretty &s;ure would not meet with their approbation: however, &s;he left me, after making &s;ome profe&s;&s;ions of a nature &s;o extremely generous, yet deli|cate, that I could not help lamenting,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
after her departure, to find &s;o very worthle&s;s a man as her brother engro&s;&s;ed &s;o great a &s;hare of her affection. For my own part, I once loved him, once tenderly loved him; but why do I torture my recollection with his name; his ba&s;ene&s;s has cured me of that pa&s;&s;ion, and I am now alive to nothing but the &s;en&s;e of my di&s;honour, and the afflictions of my family.</P>
<P>That the&s;e afflictions may be &s;peedily removed, my deare&s;t mama, is my in|ce&s;&s;ant prayer; life has now no other charm but the hope of &s;eeing your happine&s;s, the happine&s;s of my papa, and the happine&s;s of my brother, re|e&s;tabli&s;hed; could I once &s;ee the&s;e de&s;ir|able events, I &s;hould &s;ink contented into my grave; for, though I &s;hall never know a moment's peace in this world, I &s;hall not enter upon the next with any &s;atisfaction, if I have but the &s;malle&s;t

My dear brother, madam, de|&s;erves all your tenderne&s;s; and, could a union be brought about between him and my amiable Mi&s;s Beauclerk, &s;he would &s;upply every thing which I once endeavoured to be&mdash;before I was un|worthy to be called your dutiful daughter,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. <HI>Mr.</HI> MELMOTH, <HI>to Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HAROLD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are certainly one of the hap|pie&s;t fellows in the world: every thing is in a fair way of being adju&s;ted to your wi&s;hes; and, before the end of &s;ix weeks, I am in hopes to give you joy on your marriage with the amiable Mi&s;s Mildmay.</P>
<P>The moment I received your la&s;t let|ter I went to lady Haver&s;ham with it; and you may ea&s;ily judge how much that excellent woman was affected at the contents. Tremblingly attentive to your &s;afety, it was with the greate&s;t dif|ficulty &s;he could go through your ac|count of the duel; and, generou&s;ly &s;en|&s;ible to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Mildmay
<PB N="34" REF="36">
family, &s;he felt very &s;everely for the misfortune of the colonel&mdash;
<Q>O! Mr. Melmoth,</Q>
cried &s;he,
<Q>what mu&s;t poor Loui&s;a &s;uffer, what mu&s;t the good Mrs. Mildmay &s;uffer, on this &s;hocking occa&s;ion! My brother, con|&s;cious of his guilt, &s;hould have borne every thing; and yet, upon the whole, he has acted with more temper than I expected&mdash;See Sir,</Q>
continued &s;he,
<Q>how wide, how general a ruin may be occa&s;ioned by one bad action! Did young fellows con&s;ider what a number of evils may po&s;&s;ibly &s;pring from the commi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle crime, a moment's recollection would be &s;ufficient to deter them from their mo&s;t favourite pur&s;uits; but, alas! totally regardle&s;s of con&s;equences in the progre&s;s of their licentious de|&s;igns, they think the young lady is the only per&s;on to be injured, without con|&s;idering that there is a mother to die at
<PB N="35" REF="37">
her de&s;truction; and a father, or a brother, to madden at her di&s;grace.</Q></P>
<P>After lady Haver&s;ham had given way for &s;ome time to her emotion, I a&s;ked her if it would not be the mo&s;t prudent &s;tep that could be taken, for her lady|&s;hip to &s;et out in&s;tantly to Mildmay Hall with your letter in her hand, and fairly &s;hew the father and mother how little you were to be blamed in your ren|counter with the colonel. I ob&s;erved, that, notwith&s;tanding their re&s;entment again&s;t you, they had every rea&s;on to treat her with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved af|fection; and I offered my &s;ervice as an e&s;corte, if &s;he imagined I could accom|pany her with any degree of propriety. The motion met her approbation, and &s;he accepted of my offer with great &s;a|tisfaction; &s;aying, that, as Mi&s;s Mild|may's misfortune could not po&s;&s;ibly remain a &s;ecret, the pre&s;ence of a man
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;o intimate with your family could by no means be indelicate. She, however, put off the expedition till the morning, being fir&s;t of all de&s;irous to &s;ee Loui&s;a, whom &s;he had not vi&s;ited that day.&mdash;And here I mu&s;t inform you, Harold, that your &s;i&s;ter has bought a very elegant chariot, and &s;ettled matters ju&s;t as you could wi&s;h with Mrs. Darnel. When lady Haver&s;ham came to that part of your letter which mentions &s;uch a provi&s;ion&mdash;it was too much for her, &s;he laid the paper down, and bur&s;ting into a flood of tears, exclaimed&mdash;
<Q>Why, this is well thought of Mr. Melmoth&mdash;there is &s;oul in this! what pity it is that he will not be uniformly good, and take as much pains to avoid the commi&s;&s;ion of an injury as he manife&s;ts inclination to repair it!</Q>
&mdash;But to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning we &s;et out in a chariot and &s;ix for Mildmay Hall, and
<PB N="37" REF="39">
arrived there about two o'clock, quite &s;urprizing Mr. and Mrs. Mildmay, as you may naturally imagine, by our un|expected appearance. The old gentle|man at fir&s;t carried matters very high, and &s;eemed to think him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping a prodigious di|&s;tance; but lady Haver&s;ham, who has a degree of con&s;ideration that equals her benignity, kindly made allowances for his behaviour; and, &s;eizing him by the arm with all that candour of cordia|lity which generally di&s;arms an ill-grounded re&s;entment, begged of him to con&s;ider her as a faithful friend to his family, who deeply partook in his mi&s;|fortunes, though the&s;e misfortunes were unhappily created by the profligacy of her brother;&mdash;"My dear Mr. Mild|may," expo&s;tulated the admirable wo|man,
<Q>I am almo&s;t as much to be pitied as your&s;elf; you know how much my heart was in an alliance
<PB N="38" REF="40">
with your hou&s;e, and you al&s;o know how tender a friend&s;hip I ever enter|tained for the amiable Loui&s;a; don't therefore, in&s;tead of giving me con&s;o|lation, add ungenerou&s;ly to my di&s;tre&s;s; but con&s;ider me as a per&s;on deeply &s;en|&s;ible of all your wrongs; and warmly animated with all your re&s;entments. The author of the pre&s;ent calamity is my brother; but I am &s;ure you can|not think me the &s;i&s;ter of his crime; nor imagine, that, becau&s;e I am allied to him in blood, I mu&s;t likewi&s;e be allied to the guilty part of his charac|ter. Look at me, I be&s;eech you, with complacency; and tell me that my pre&s;ence is not unwelcome in the country.</Q></P>
<P>This addre&s;s there was no po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;i&s;ting&mdash;Mr. Mildmay's heart was melted; and, in &s;pite of all his pride, he took hold of her hand with an air of
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the greate&s;t re&s;pect, held it to his lips, and endeavoured to make an apology&mdash;A ri&s;ing flood of grief, however, choak|ed the pa&s;&s;age of his words; he broke into a &s;ob of inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction; and ha&s;tily retired out of the room. You know, Harold, how readily the mother, as you call it, comes into my eyes; you know, be&s;ides, that I am twenty good years older than you, and have been once a father. I could not, therefore, &s;tand the exce&s;s of poor Mr. Mildmay's emotion; my handkerchief was out in an in&s;tant, and, notwith&s;tand|ing my utmo&s;t efforts, to &s;uppre&s;s my concern, I blubbered &s;o heartily as to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of retiring al&s;o, unac|quainted as I was with the hou&s;e, and ridiculous as I mu&s;t have made my&s;elf to the &s;ervants. As to Mrs. Mildmay, nothing can be more tender or affecting than the reception of your &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;The two ladies, at their fir&s;t meeting, remain|ed
<PB N="40" REF="42">
cla&s;ped for &s;ome moments in each other's arms, each unable to &s;peak a &s;yllable, and both giving a very copious freedom to their tears.</P>
<P>When we had all a little recovered our&s;elves, and taken a di&s;h of chocolate, lady Haver&s;ham, with her u&s;ual delicacy, began to enter upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of her journey; lamenting the colonel's wound, in terms the mo&s;t friendly; and hoping that the unfortunate affair at Reading would not prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of a reconciliation between the two families: &s;he then &s;et forth your extreme contri|tion for the part you had acted by Loui&s;a; and in&s;inuated that &s;he had a letter from you in her pocket, which, if Mr. Mildmay would take the trouble of reading, &s;he was certain, would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, le&s;&s;en the &s;everity of his pre&s;ent indignation. Mr. Mildmay up|on this took fire; &s;wearing, with great
<PB N="41" REF="43">
vehemence, that, &s;o far from con&s;enting to a reconciliation, he never would en|joy a moment's peace of mind till you were &s;acrificed to his vengeance; and, that, if he but knew where you were then concealed, he would him&s;elf, old as he was, call you to an in&s;tant account for murdering the reputation of his family.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion which we naturally expected, and therefore did not once interrupt him, till it was en|tirely exhau&s;ted; lady Haver&s;ham then re&s;umed the &s;ubject, and begged of him to con&s;ider, that &s;he was now talking as much for the &s;ake of his happine&s;s, as for the happine&s;s of her brother.&mdash;"Indeed, my dear Mr. Mildmay," con|tinued &s;he,
<Q>if I was not &s;en&s;ible that the pre&s;ent calamity, under which we all labour, requires great allowances, I &s;hould be apt to think you almo&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="44">
as culpable as my brother him&s;elf. Does it follow, becau&s;e he has gro&s;sly injured the honour of your hou&s;e, that you your&s;elf &s;hould do it &s;till greater injuries? or can it admit of a mo|ment's debate which is the mo&s;t proper cour&s;e to follow&mdash;that which will re|cover the tranquility of your family, or that which will expo&s;e it to an additional di&s;tre&s;s?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If calling my brother to an ac|count for his mi&s;behaviour, could be attended with any advantages, I &s;hould not wonder &s;o greatly at your re&s;ent|ment; but when to do that, as has been already unhappily the ca&s;e, the &s;afety of a dear and de&s;erving &s;on mu&s;t be hazarded; and when, even if he &s;hould kill his antagoni&s;t, he mu&s;t forfeit his own life to the violated laws of his country&mdash;I &s;ay, when the&s;e things are con&s;idered; and when it is
<PB N="43" REF="45">
moreover recollected, that, though the lenity of the laws &s;hould &s;pare the life of your &s;on, it can by no means re|&s;tore your peace; I am in hopes that your own good &s;en&s;e will induce you to abate the warmth of your indigna|tion, and that you will prefer a cer|tain felicity to a precarious revenge&mdash;Ju&s;tice, you &s;ee, by the colonel's un|fortunate wound, may &s;ometimes be unattended with &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;hould you &s;till pro&s;ecute a quarrel with a man who de&s;ires, who &s;upplicates, who implores to make every reparation that <HI>can</HI> be made; the world will think your re&s;entment carried to an unrea|&s;onable length, and be apt even to rejoice &s;hould you meet with any new calamity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To the arguments which I have already offered, my dear Mr. Mild|may, I have another very forcible
<PB N="44" REF="46">
plea to add, which I am &s;ure mu&s;t operate on your tenderne&s;s, as a hu&s;|band; and upon your ju&s;tice, as a man:&mdash;Turn, Sir, to this venerable, this excellent woman, the companion of your youth, the partner of your &s;or|rows, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of your heart&mdash;&s;ee where &s;he is, &s;inking under the &s;tern|ne&s;s of your re&s;olution, and bleeding with an apprehen&s;ion of future mi&s;|fortunes, as well as with a &s;en&s;ibility of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;She, Sir, has a mother's claim in the &s;on, who&s;e life you are &s;o willing to expo&s;e. Do not drive her into ab&s;olute di&s;traction&mdash;Her angui&s;h is already exce&s;&s;ive, and her death mu&s;t be inevitable, if you think of wa&s;hing away her daughter's &s;tain with nothing but the blood of her &s;on. On my knees, therefore, Mr. Mildmay,</Q>
and down the wonderful woman dropped,
<Q>let me beg of you to think of a recon|ciliation.
<PB N="45" REF="47">
&mdash;My brother is deeply wounded by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own guilt; and will, I am certain, from motives of gratitude, as well as affection, make a good &s;on, and a de&s;erving hu&s;band. Do not, my dear Mr. Mildmay, becau&s;e one affliction has interrupted your happine&s;s, ra&s;h|ly devote your&s;elf to wretchedne&s;s for life; but rather &s;eize the be&s;t means of di&s;pelling the cloud which at pre|&s;ent overca&s;ts your peace; and en|deavour at recovering the genial &s;un|&s;hine of that tranquility which has been &s;o recently and &s;o fatally lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Mildmay (who all the time of your &s;i&s;ter's kneeling, in vain attempted to rai&s;e her up) &s;eemed greatly &s;truck with what &s;he &s;aid; but, though his rea&s;on was convinced, his pride never|thele&s;s held an ob&s;tinate &s;truggle, and he &s;everal times attempted to quit the
<PB N="46" REF="48">
room&mdash;Lady Haver&s;ham and I as often prevented him from going out; we pre|vailed upon him with difficulty, to hear the principal part of your letter read; and Mrs. Mildmay her&s;elf kneeling to him, and in very pathetic terms reque&s;t|ing him to oblige lady Haver&s;ham, he was at la&s;t overcome, and con&s;ented that you might be &s;ent for as &s;oon as we plea&s;ed, de&s;iring only that the ceremony might be delayed till the recovery of the colonel.</P>
<P>When we had thus &s;ettled the mate|rial affair, our conver&s;ation naturally turned upon the colonel's ca&s;e, and the abilities of his attendants.&mdash;Mr. Mild|may &s;aid, that, though the wound at fir&s;t appeared extremely dangerous, as it was very near the groin; neverthe|le&s;s, the &s;urgeons now told him, that there was but little doubt of a fine cure, provided he e&s;caped a fever&mdash;
<PB N="47" REF="49">
"And this" &s;aid the old gentleman,
<Q>I am no way unea&s;y about, as the wea|ther is very cold and his pul&s;e &s;o very temperate: but,</Q>
added he,
<Q>&s;uppo&s;e you go and &s;ee him; there is nobody with him but Mi&s;s Beauclerk: and he had &s;o fine a morning's &s;leep that we &s;han't in the lea&s;t fatigue him with our company.</Q>
We accordingly went; and were received, as I expected, with great coldne&s;s, though with great civi|lity&mdash;The &s;ight of people &s;o very near to you naturally hurting that impatience which we all labour under where we have received any thing which looks like a di&s;grace. Lady Haver&s;ham, how|ever, went up to him as if &s;he had been his &s;i&s;ter; and expre&s;&s;ed her concern for the cau&s;e of his misfortune, with &s;o un|affected an air of cordiality as reconciled him a little to his vi&s;itors. We then acquainted him with the bu&s;ine&s;s of our journey, talked matters over again, and
<PB N="48" REF="50">
read all your letter but that part where the provi&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter is mentioned: he was extremely attentive to your ac|count of the duel, and begged more than once to hear a repetition of &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages. When I had done, he pau&s;ed a little, and &s;aid, you were <HI>very</HI> exact in the relation; and that, had he imagined you were actuated by a &s;incere concern for your indi&s;cretion, and were really going up to town with a view of entreating Loui&s;a's forgivene&s;s, he would not have been &s;o ra&s;h: "But," &s;ays he,
<Q>my heart was in the match&mdash;and to find every thing broken off while I was flattering my imagination with the happine&s;s my family was to po&s;&s;es&mdash;to find the rupture al&s;o &s;o di&s;honourable to us; and to think that a &s;i&s;ter, who was my principal pride, &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch a crime, made me ab&s;olutely mad; &s;o that I almo&s;t wonder how I refrained from
<PB N="49" REF="51">
&s;hooting Sir Robert through the head before I even offered him the choice of a pi&s;tol.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the colonel's &s;eem|ing frankne&s;s, I could ea&s;ily &s;ee he was &s;ecretly di&s;&s;atisfied that he had not been con&s;ulted by his father in the conclu&s;ion of our accommodation. When the old gentlemen told him what he had con|&s;ented to, he was extremely grave, and ob&s;erved,
<Q>That to be &s;ure it was better to &s;ettle matters any how, than to think of going farther with family re&s;entments.</Q>
The tone and look with which he delivered this were vi&s;i|bly &s;arca&s;tic; and I could, however, rea|dily perceive he &s;omewhat di&s;concerted his father. We took no notice of the expre&s;&s;ion, however; lady Haver&s;ham thinking with me, that tho&s;e may be allowed to complain a little who feel a great deal. Dinner being ready by this
<PB N="50" REF="52">
time, we took our leave of the colonel, and &s;at down in a very &s;ociable manner to a very good repa&s;t. Your &s;i&s;ter was all life; and Mrs. Mildmay, who has been a very fine woman, was animated with a chearfulne&s;s that really filled me with plea&s;ure; as, from the character lady Haver&s;ham gave me of her worth, I could not but &s;hare very &s;en&s;ibly in her afflictions.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we were all extremely happy but Mi&s;s Beauclerk. This young lady, who ought to be the gaye&s;t per&s;on in company, was remarkably thoughtful and re&s;erved; &s;he &s;carcely touched a mor&s;el of any thing, and even more than once let a &s;igh e&s;cape her pretty audible: &s;he is a very fine girl indeed, Harold; and, if &s;he is but half as good as &s;he is hand|&s;ome, it would be ten thou&s;and pities that any thing &s;hould give her the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.

exce&s;&s;ively I am taken with her&mdash;there is &s;o much real good &s;en&s;e, &s;o much genuine delicacy, and &s;o much true be|nevolence in every word and action, that was it po&s;&s;ible for me ever to marry a &s;econd time, or po&s;&s;ible for her to look on &s;uch an old fellow, I really believe &s;he would be the woman in the world whom I &s;hould fir&s;t think of&mdash;but what have I do with the &s;ex!

<P>The ladies retiring a little after dinner, and leaving Mr. Mildmay and I to chat over a bottle of Burgundy, I took the liberty to make &s;ome enquiry about Mi&s;s Beauclerk, a&s;&s;uring the old gentleman that I was &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed in her favour.&mdash;
<Q>Why truly, Mr. Melmoth,</Q>
returned he,
<Q>I don't know a &s;weeter, better tempered girl in the world than this young lady; my Loui&s;a and &s;he contracted an in|timacy at the boarding &s;chool, when they were both very young, and have ever &s;ince been remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for the clo&s;ene&s;s of their friend|&s;hip; the one never knowing joy or a &s;orrow in which the other did not
<PB N="53" REF="55">
immediately enhance the &s;atisfaction, or mitigate the di&s;tre&s;s. I am &s;ure, in the late unhappy affair, my daughter's misfortune affected Mi&s;s Beauclerk as clo&s;ely as if Loui&s;a had actually been her &s;i&s;ter&mdash;During the time of her being here, &s;he has applied her|&s;elf with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity to comfort and take care of my poor wife, that I con&s;ider her as a principal in&s;trument in Mrs. Mildmay's pre&s;ervation&mdash;Her mother, Sir, lo&s;t her hu&s;band while Harriot was yet an infant at the brea&s;t; he died it &s;eems in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and left the good lady in &s;uch very &s;lender circum&s;tances, that, had not a relation of her own, who died al&s;o about the &s;ame time, left her a fortune of 20000l. in the funds, &s;he mu&s;t have gone into &s;ome little way of bu&s;ine&s;s for the maintenance of her&s;elf and her daughter. Upon the intere&s;t of this &s;um &s;he keeps a carriage, and
<PB N="54" REF="56">
has a mo&s;t delightful retirement about thirty miles off&mdash;What is extremely re|markable, is, that, though &s;he was not much above twenty when her hu&s;band died, and when &s;he came into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of this fortune, yet, &s;o far from acting like the generality of women, and li&s;tening to the addre&s;&s;es of every coxcomb who might have de&s;igns either upon her per&s;on or her pur&s;e, &s;he retired immediately from London to the &s;pot I have been &s;peaking of, and there continued ever &s;ince, con|fining her vi&s;its within a very narrow circle, and dedicating her attention to the education of her daughter. Within a mile of her hou&s;e my Loui&s;a was at &s;chool when a child; and the inti|macy between the little ones naturally creating an acquaintance between the parents, Mrs. Beauclerk and our fa|mily have been upon the mo&s;t unre|&s;erved footing of friend&s;hip the&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="57">
&s;ixteen years; and, I dare &s;ay, &s;hall continue in friend&s;hip till the end of our lives, as there is but one circum|&s;tance which can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;turb the harmony of our corre&s;pondence.</Q></P>
<P>As it would have been extremely rude in a &s;tranger to a&s;k what this cir|cum&s;tance was, I did not interrupt Mr. Mildmay; neverthele&s;s I was lucky enough, in the naturally communicative|ne&s;s of his temper, to have my curio&s;ity gratified; his heart was now open, and he con&s;idered me as a good natured friendly man who might be tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret; drawing his chair therefore clo&s;er to mine, and lowering his voice, he proceeded to unbo&s;om him&s;elf to the following purport.</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t know, Mr. Melmoth, that, during the intimacy between Mrs. Beauclerk's family and mine, I have
<PB N="56" REF="58">
di&s;covered that my &s;on entertains very favourable &s;entiments of her daugh|ter; and between our&s;elves I can &s;ee plainly enough that her daughter is no way di&s;inclined to my &s;on. I have been a young fellow my&s;elf, Mr. Mel|moth; and, in my time&mdash;you under|&s;tand me&mdash;but that is nothing to the purpo&s;e&mdash;As I was &s;aying, this mu|tual good opinion between Harry and Mi&s;s Beauclerk, is a thing which gives me no little unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;the young lady to be &s;ure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very high place in my e&s;teem, and I don't know a woman in the kingdom whom I &s;hould be better plea&s;ed to have for a daughter; but the misfortune is &s;he does not carry &s;ufficient weight of metal, and I have &s;ome family views in my head, which, though I am pretty well in the world, require a con&s;idera|ble addition of fortune. My hou&s;e, Mr. Melmoth, is a very antient one;
<PB N="57" REF="59">
there have been more than two peer|ages in it; and I have my&s;elf &s;ome expectation of a title. Now, Sir, as the &s;upport of &s;uch a dignity cannot allow me to marry my &s;on to a woman of little fortune; on this account I am greatly concerned that any &s;ecret corre&s;pondence &s;hould be carried on between him and Mi&s;s Beauclerk. I &s;hould be very &s;orry to oppo&s;e his inclinations, or to wound her &s;en&s;ibi|lity; but you know the rai&s;ing of one's family is a very e&s;&s;ential point; and that, ridiculous as a coronet may appear to &s;ome people, it is never|thele&s;s entitled to priviledges, which are far from being di&s;agreeable&mdash;This is not all&mdash;a noble lord in the neigh|bourhood, who is able to give his daughter a prodigious &s;um of money, has lately intimated, a de&s;ire of unit|ing his family with mine; and I think &s;o very well of the affair, that I
<PB N="58" REF="60">
mentioned it ye&s;terday to my &s;on, when I found him launching out into &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate encomiums on Mi&s;s Beauclerk.</Q>
&mdash;Mr. Mildmay pau&s;ing in this place, I could not help ob&s;erv|ing, that, though the plan which was thus laid down for the aggrandization of his family, might in it&s;elf be ex|tremely right, neverthele&s;s, if his &s;on entertained a cordial affection for the young lady, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hand might be more conducive to his happi|ne&s;s than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a title; and that therefore it might be difficult to make him &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of his heart even to gratify the laudable am|bition of his father&mdash;But the old gen|tleman &s;topped me &s;hort, by declaring, He believed the colonel would do any thing to oblige him. "However," &s;ays he,
<Q>if I &s;hould be unhappily di&s;ap|pointed of his obedience in the matter we have been talking of, I know how
<PB N="59" REF="61">
to puni&s;h his ob&s;tinacy when I come to di&s;po&s;e of my fortune.</Q>
Here our conver&s;ation ended, for the ladies com|ing in we were obliged to talk of &s;ome|thing el&s;e; though I &s;hould have told you, that Mr. Mildmay more than once in&s;inuated a fear, that his lady &s;ecretly approved of the pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween Mi&s;s Beauclerk and the colonel.</P>
<P>I could moralize in this place, Sir Robert, on the prepo&s;terous behaviour of tho&s;e fathers who are willing to give their children every thing but happine&s;s. Reflections of this nature, however, are too common to be u&s;eful; and it would be ju&s;t as new to tell you, that the parts of a day con&s;i&s;t of twenty-four hours, as to tell you that the very fondne&s;s of &s;uch fathers is the mo&s;t in|&s;upportable of all tyrannies. Poor Mi&s;s Beauclerk&mdash;and is the tawdry gewgaw of a coronet to be put in competition
<PB N="60" REF="62">
with the charms of exalted virtue, elevat|ed &s;en&s;e, and &s;weetne&s;s ineffable! But love would be too exqui&s;ite an enjoyment, Harold, had not Providence wi&s;ely thrown the&s;e bars in our way, and tem|pered the inexpre&s;&s;ible raptures which it be&s;tows with &s;ome occa&s;ional mixtures of infelicity.</P>
<P>Lady Haver&s;ham ju&s;t now called me a&s;ide, and hinted that &s;he had &s;poken to Mrs. Mildmay relative to &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions which Loui&s;a had dropped in your &s;i&s;ter's la&s;t interview with her, in|dicating the mo&s;t po&s;itive determination of never &s;eeing you more. Mrs. Mild|may is to write to her on this &s;ubject, and therefore &s;he can but little doubt of Loui&s;a's altering her determination; the re&s;olution of her family in your favour was the principal point to gain; and &s;ince we could work upon their pride, there can be no doubt of influencing
<PB N="61" REF="63">
her &s;en&s;ibility. A woman, Harold, can forgive every thing where &s;he really loves; the ladies have a &s;oftne&s;s about them which turns even contempt into kindne&s;s, and gives the tenderne&s;s of their hearts a con&s;tant &s;uperiority over the goodne&s;s of their under&s;tandings. I &s;hould be &s;orry, however, that all cox|combs were for reducing this precept into practice; as we have already but too many fools among the fair who are de&s;irous of &s;tamping their weakne&s;s with the immediate image of de&s;tiny, and &s;o|licitous to call that an ab&s;olute decree of fate which ari&s;es from their own appa|rent want of re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I have been this moment at a con&s;ul|tation of colonel Mildmay's &s;urgeons, and have the very great plea&s;ure of in|forming you that he is entirely out of danger.&mdash;You may therefore, by the next Helvoet&s;luys packet, make a trip
<PB N="62" REF="64">
to Harwich, &s;ince at the utmo&s;t it can't be above twelve hours from Rotterdam to Helvoet. If you &s;hould &s;top at the Hague, pray call at Fitzpatrick's in the Hoog&s;traat; who is as mode&s;t, as &s;en&s;i|ble, and as well behaved a man as I ever &s;aw at the head of a tavern; and who, without mentioning any body's name, will treat you with the utmo&s;t civility: if you know the man already my cha|racter will be needle&s;s; if you do not, you will find a very good hou&s;e, and &s;o far be obliged to me for this accommo|dation.</P>
<P>As we have done our bu&s;ine&s;s at Mildmay Hall, your &s;i&s;ter and I &s;hall &s;et out for London, in order to wait upon Loui&s;a, and acquaint her with the determination of her father. Mrs. Mild|may has a letter to &s;end by us to her daughter, which will put a fini&s;hing hand to the reconciliation; &s;o that, Bob, you
<PB N="63" REF="65">
may look upon the whole affair as con|cluded to your wi&s;h; yet it is ten to one that, now happine&s;s is again within your reach, but what you &s;trive to &s;tart difficulties, and endeavour to de&s;troy all that lady Haver&s;ham and I have been labouring to bring about with &s;uch an unremitting degree of fedulity.</P>
<P>Take care, however, dear Harold, how you act at this time; and do not idly play the prodigal with your own happine&s;s&mdash;Youth can never excu&s;e a bad action, though it may extenuate the indi&s;cretion of a fooli&s;h one; and the man who is twice guilty of the &s;ame crime, is in much more danger of mak|ing him&s;elf abhorred, than in rendering others wretched or contemptible; take the hint therefore, Bob, and believe me, with the utmo&s;t cordiality,</P>

<P>IF you have not yet &s;et out from Rot|terdam, you may as well continue where you are, or go to any other part of the continent which is be&s;t adapted to your inclination; England is not a place which I would have you return to yet awhile, if you really love Mi&s;s Mildmay, and would be concerned to find her actually allied to infamy and pro&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter and I arrived in town this morning; and, unable to contain the &s;a|tisfaction with which our bo&s;oms na|turally &s;welled at your approaching feli|city;
<PB N="65" REF="67">
we immediately drove to Loui&s;a's, with a view of di&s;pelling her unhappi|ne&s;s, by acquainting her with the for|tunate reconciliation effected between her and her family&mdash;But judge our a&s;toni&s;hment, when, in&s;tead of meeting with her, Mrs. Darnel came down &s;tairs with an air of the utmo&s;t affliction, and informed us that Mi&s;s Mildmay had eloped in a po&s;t-chai&s;e and &s;ix, with a gentleman richly dre&s;&s;ed, the preceding evening&mdash;
<Q>Having no authority to watch her motions,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darnel,
<Q>and imagining from her &s;pecious air of penitence, if I even had, that every attention of that nature would be ut|terly unnece&s;&s;ary, I went to hear a lecture at our pari&s;h-church after tea, never once dreaming that during my ab&s;ence &s;he would think of running away from a hou&s;e into which &s;he had entered a voluntary vi&s;itor, and in which there was no likelihood of her
<PB N="66" REF="68">
receiving the &s;malle&s;t di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;You may, however, ea&s;ily gue&s;s my con|&s;ternation, when my maid Jenny, the moment I came home, ran up and in|formed me that Mi&s;s Mildmay had gone off with a gentleman in a po&s;t|chai&s;e. I naturally concluded, that, had it been any relation, I &s;hould have received &s;ome notice of her intended departure; and therefore, as &s;he went away in &s;o unaccountable a manner, I as naturally a&s;cribed her flight to &s;ome preconcerted de&s;ign; e&s;pecially as Jenny informed me, that a gentleman in brown and gold had for two or three nights been &s;een to hang about the hou&s;e, and to peep in at the windows with a degree of breed|ing much below the elegance of his appearance&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e unpromi&s;ing accounts, I neverthele&s;s &s;at up till four o'clock, rather hoping than expecting the unfortunate young
<PB N="67" REF="69">
lady's return; but, alas! I might have &s;at up till this moment, without reap|ing the lea&s;t advantage from my anxiety or my fatigue; &s;he never once approached the hou&s;e, and which way &s;he has gone I am by no means able to conjecture.</Q></P>
<P>And this, Sir Robert, is the end of all our expectations. For my own part, &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;olicitous as I was but a few hours ago in her favour, I now &s;incerely congratulate with you on your fortunate e&s;cape; I now begin to think you were right in rejecting her from the fir&s;t, and am perfectly &s;atisfied that the error, which I thought the effect of her partiality for you, was nothing more than the re&s;ult of her own con&s;titution. Lady Haver&s;ham, however, will not &s;ub|&s;cribe to my opinion of her levity, tho' &s;he knows not any cau&s;e to which
<PB N="68" REF="70">
her elopement can be &s;o probably attri|buted&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, &s;he thinks all enquiry after her needle&s;s; and almo&s;t wi&s;hes that &s;he had not taken the journey into Oxford&s;hire&mdash;
<Q>For this new di&s;appointment, Mr. Melmoth,</Q>
&s;ays &s;he,
<Q>will come with additional weight upon her family; and, if it does not entirely kill the poor mother, it will certainly drive her di&s;tracted.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnel, who appears to be a decent well behaved woman, notwith|&s;tanding your &s;u&s;picions, is to &s;end down an account of Loui&s;a's elopement to Mildmay Hall. What con&s;equences it may produce there I know not; but of this I am certain, that you have every rea&s;on in nature to be happy in the timely di&s;covery of her levity&mdash;Had &s;uch a di&s;|covery been made after your marriage with her, I &s;uppo&s;e the re&s;ult would
<PB N="69" REF="71">
have been her immediate death, and your certain execution&mdash;You would have &s;acrificed her in&s;tantly to your fury; and your life would have been the penalty of your ra&s;hne&s;s. Return thanks, there|fore, to Providence for having &s;uch a fortunate e&s;cape, and do not meanly re|gret the lo&s;s of a woman whom you know to be guilty, when you could &s;o readily give her up at a time that you thought her innocence, in a manner, un|que&s;tionable. But you &s;ee, Harold, that innocence, like contrition, may be ea&s;ily affected; and that tho&s;e may &s;eem the mo&s;t &s;trenuous votaries of virtue, who are in fact the lea&s;t unhappy at its lo&s;s.</P>
<P>If any thing new &s;hould occur before you think of returning home, you need not doubt of my readine&s;s to commu|nicate it. Lady Haver&s;ham is extreme|ly affected with Loui&s;a's behaviour, but

attempts very little, if any thing, in her defence; &s;he &s;ends her be&s;t wi&s;hes to you by this letter; and de&s;ires me to a&s;&s;ure you, that &s;he is as much your affectionate &s;i&s;ter as I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> MAMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A DISTRESS of a more piercing nature than ever has fallen upon this unhappy family. You will &s;carcely conceive, and I have &s;carcely power to inform you; but my wretched friend Mi&s;s Mildmay, while lady Haver&s;ham was down here, as I told you in my la&s;t letter, &s;ettling every thing to our wi&s;hes, and re&s;toring every body to peace, eloped from Mrs. Darnel's, in London, with a &s;trange gentleman, in a chariot and &s;ix, while her cou&s;in was at church; and where &s;he is gone there is no likelihood of di&s;covering; Mrs. Darnel's account of this affair reached us this morning;
<PB N="72" REF="74">
and from the pain which I know your own worthy heart will feel on this melan|choly occa&s;ion, you may ea&s;ily imagine what an effect it had on her poor father and mother; upon her brother and my|&s;elf. I would, if po&s;&s;ible, have kept it from the colonel, as I thought the know|ledge of &s;o fatal an accident might ma|terially retard his recovery&mdash;But Mr. Mildmay's rage was too violent, and the venerable lady's angui&s;h too exce&s;&s;ive, to admit of &s;uch a &s;alutary &s;ecrecy; &s;o that, in le&s;s than five minutes, he was made acquainted with the minute&s;t cir|cum&s;tances; and the agitation of his mind has been &s;o prodigious ever &s;ince, that his phy&s;icians begin to be appre|hen&s;ive about the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear mama, I am, inexpre&s;|&s;ibly wretched from the part which I am to act in the general calamity&mdash;every body turns to me for con&s;olation,&mdash;
<PB N="73" REF="75">
when my own bo&s;om is torn with a thou&s;and di&s;tre&s;&s;es&mdash;and expects that I &s;hould be able to admini&s;ter comfort, when I am equally, if not more, mi&s;era|ble my&s;elf. You, my deare&s;t mama, mu&s;t &s;ooth my afflictions&mdash;You mu&s;t enable me, by the magnanimity of your example, and the wi&s;dom of your advice, to bear up again&s;t this unexpected &s;troke of misfortune, which now falls on me with an aggravated heavine&s;s, as it comes in the hour of my utmo&s;t &s;ecurity, and invades me in the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting moment of my hopes&mdash;I was fea&s;ting my imagination, madam, with number|le&s;s pro&s;pects of future felicity; and preparing my heart for nothing but hap|pine&s;s and you&mdash;When, alas! the golden &s;cene is in&s;tantly ravi&s;hed from my eyes, and the whole void as in&s;tantly filled up with di&s;appointment and de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">When I con&s;ider this unaccountable &s;tep of Loui&s;a's, I am lo&s;t in perplexity and doubt&mdash;Mrs. Darnel's letter ac|quaints us that &s;he went away of her own accord; that &s;he was not carried off by force, but that &s;he ab&s;olutely eloped; and the maid even de&s;cribes the gentle|man with whom &s;he went, as a tall hand&s;ome man, dre&s;t in brown, richly laced with gold; &s;he &s;ays al&s;o, that he was a very fair man, and wore a bob wig. All this is mighty odd&mdash;I have known her from her infancy up; have &s;hared every &s;ecret of her heart, and never conceived that &s;he entertained the lea&s;t affection for any body but Sir Robert Harold&mdash;Him it cannot be, as by Mr. Melmoth's account he &s;et out for Holland the moment after the unhappy duel between him and the colonel; and be&s;ides, he has a com|plexion remarkably black, and wears his own hair. When I put all the&s;e
<PB N="75" REF="77">
things together, my dear mama, I am a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;Loui&s;a would hardly go off with a man for whom &s;he felt no affec|tion; and the whole tenor of her life has been &s;o generou&s;ly frank, and open; and &s;o repugnant to every thing like hypocri&s;y or artifice; that I could &s;take my exi&s;tence Sir Robert is the only man for whom &s;he cheri&s;hed a favourable &s;entiment&mdash;Be&s;ides, madam, if you were to &s;ee the letter which &s;he &s;ent her mother, you would be &s;atisfied, that, notwith&s;tanding her unhappy lap&s;e with that gentleman, &s;he is infinitely above the appearance of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;Her error is there acknowleged in &s;uch forcible terms; and lamented with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of unextenuating penitence, that her faults almo&s;t render her amiable, and the only emotions which we feel are tho&s;e of pity and admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I am po&s;itive my amiable friend can be no way depraved in her principles; yet, on the other hand, Mrs. Darnel is a woman of known &s;obriety and character; is re|ceived among people of the fir&s;t di&s;tinc|tion, in con&s;equence of her good beha|viour; and &s;he mentions Loui&s;a's elope|ment with &s;o po&s;itive a degree of cer|tainty, that there can be no po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;puting the fact&mdash;God grant that this contradiction may be happily reconciled. My own &s;oul is not dearer in my e&s;ti|mation than the happine&s;s of Mi&s;s Mild|may; and I don't know that I could be able to &s;urvive any in&s;tance of her pre|mediated unworthine&s;s&mdash;Premeditated unworthine&s;s! No, my ever amiable Loui&s;a, you are incapable of a deliberate guilt; and the bare &s;uppo&s;ition was a bla&s;phemy again&s;t the purity of our mutual affection&mdash;The heart which can que&s;tion the virtue of a friend till it
<PB N="77" REF="79">
argues upon ab&s;olute conviction, is a traitor to the cau&s;e of amity; the mo&s;t alarming appearance &s;hould never &s;hake the confidence of our friend&s;hip; and though, in every thing el&s;e, a nice combination of accidents may ju&s;tify a doubt, yet here we ought never to he&s;i|tate upon circum&s;tances, nor to le&s;&s;en in our regards till conjecture is evidently lo&s;t, in certainty.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, my dear mama, I have repeatedly urged in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things to the good Mrs. Mild|may&mdash;But &s;he &s;hakes her head when I want her to reduce the precept into practice; and, while the large drops cour&s;e one another down her venerable cheeks, &s;he tells me the &s;entiment &s;ounds prettily enough upon the ear, but is little calculated to convince the under&s;tand|ing. I wi&s;h, my dear mama, you could come over to us; there never was a

<P>As you, my dear mama, are one of tho&s;e excellent women who bring up a daughter rather in a &s;tate of re&s;pectful familiarity with you, than endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h an authority by keeping her in a di&s;tant degree of abject &s;ubjection&mdash;As you are generous enough to receive tho&s;e in&s;tances of confidence as a favour which you can command as a right, and can blend all the tenderne&s;s of the parent with all the freedom of the friend, I am enabled to talk to you on a &s;ubject which few young women ever care to mention to a mother, though a mother's

ear is the propere&s;t by much for a bu&s;i|ne&s;s of &s;uch importance.</P>
<P>You have often, my dear madam, kindly hinted your apprehen&s;ion, that the merits of colonel Mildmay were making too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart; and that I &s;hould by all means re&s;i&s;t every impul&s;e of a tender nature, in his favour, as there was but too much rea&s;on to apprehend that the di&s;|parity of our fortunes would be a ma|terial bar to our union, notwith&s;tanding the harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;o long between our two families. Your advice, my ever honoured mama, I was convinced was perfectly ju&s;t; neverthele&s;s&mdash;but why &s;hould I think of concealing any thing from my be&s;t friend&mdash;from the only per&s;on in the world who by nature and inclination mu&s;t be the readie&s;t to re|joice at my felicity, or to participate in my di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Yes, madam, I mu&s;t own,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
in &s;pite of all your judicious precau|tions, my heart was in&s;en&s;ibly engaged, and I loved before I was aware that the colonel had any other place in my affections, than what was due to the bro|ther of Loui&s;a&mdash;You, madam, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t have &s;een, upon &s;everal occa|&s;ions, what an awkward con&s;traint I have laboured under when I have been in his company&mdash;Your penetration could not be eluded, though I then fondly thought nobody could &s;ee into my &s;entiments, and piqued my&s;elf upon the addre&s;s with which I behaved in &s;o very critical a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Indeed, the re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s with which the colonel all along treated me, contributed not a little to rai&s;e him in my e&s;teem&mdash;Upon a thou&s;and little oc|ca&s;ions he gave me proof of his good opinion, though he never made me the mo&s;t di&s;tant tendre of his heart; but

judging of his &s;entiments by my own; or po&s;&s;ibly believing, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed it might be &s;o, that he really &s;aw me with more than a common degree of friend|&s;hip; I &s;uffered the flame imperceptibly to &s;pread, and was &s;olicitous only of concealing my weakne&s;s from his ob&s;er|vation; but matters, madam, have, at la&s;t, come to &s;omething of a cri&s;is, and I have the &s;atisfaction of <HI>knowing</HI> that my tenderne&s;s is at lea&s;t returned, whether I am ever ble&s;t with the object of it or not.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day after the colonel's coming down wounded, before he was yet pronounced out of danger, he &s;ent his compliments to me, and begged I would favour him with a vi&s;it, as he had &s;omething of importance to acquaint me with. The light in which I was con&s;ider|ed by every body in the family, joined to the nature of his &s;ituation, would

have made it affectation to the la&s;t de|gree, had I not immediately complied with his reque&s;t&mdash;I therefore went, and the attendants being ordered out of the room, he begged of me to &s;eat my&s;elf clo&s;e to the bed&s;ide; where, taking hold of my hand, and de&s;iring I would not be offended at what he was going to &s;ay, he went on to the following purport.</P>
<Q>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my mind and the angui&s;h of my wound, rendering my recovery extremely precarious, I have pre&s;umed, Mi&s;s Beauclerk, to beg your ear upon a &s;ubject, which, though very near my heart, I would not, for particular rea&s;ons, enter upon, was there a certainty either that medicine or time could do me any e&s;&s;ential be|nefit. As it is therefore doubtful how long I may be in a capacity of delivering my&s;elf intelligibly, I have determined to &s;eize the pre&s;ent oppor|tunity

of opening my mind, &s;ince, was I to leave the world without telling you how dear you have always been to my &s;oul, my parting moments would be imbittered with an anxiety that mu&s;t render the natural gloomine&s;s of death inconceivably afflicting&mdash;O! Mi&s;s Beauclerk, from the fir&s;t mo|ment I beheld you, young as we both were, I loved you&mdash;Every day, as you ro&s;e into perfection, I felt an encrea&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, though I &s;trove to conceal my &s;entiments very carefully from the world, as I &s;aw but too many diffi|culties in the way of our union, had I even merit enough to &s;olicit with a likelihood of &s;ucce&s;s. In &s;hort, madam, I found my father's ambition was utterly unfavourable to my hopes&mdash;And I &s;aw that you had too much dignity of di&s;po&s;ition to come into a family, that would look upon your alliance in a di&s;agreeable light; or

I have always looked with dete&s;tation on tho&s;e men, who, though they were con&s;cious of &s;ome family con&s;ideration that mu&s;t prevent them from accepting the honour of a lady's hand, were neverthele&s;s in&s;olent enough, or cruel enough, to aim at engaging her affections&mdash;On the&s;e ac|counts, I &s;ay, madam, had I even rea&s;on to think you would have ble&s;t me with a reciprocal e&s;teem, I had avoided the pre&s;umption, or the ba&s;ene&s;s, of a declaration; &s;ince, as there was no pro&s;pect of leading you into any certain &s;tate of felicity, it

<P>O! mama, what a mind has this man!&mdash;Here, however, he was obliged to re&s;t him&s;elf a little, while the only reply I could make was with my tears.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, he re&s;umed the affecting &s;ubject, and thus continued his di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;
<Q>I do not now, my ever adorable Mi&s;s Beauclerk, meanly intend, by an addre&s;s to your genero&s;ity, to make any intere&s;t with your heart&mdash;Your e&s;teem I &s;hould be proud of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; but thus hover|ing, as I may &s;ay, on the verge of eternity, I &s;hould be &s;orry, for your own &s;ake, was I honoured with your love&mdash;May that, madam, be re&s;erved for &s;ome fortunate man, who&s;e merits are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify your choice, and who&s;e &s;ituation will not create any

his favour, that I never thought of interrupting him; but continued one pa&s;&s;ive hand all the time in his, the other being employed in holding up my hand|kerchief to my eyes, which were by this time quite red, and &s;wollen with my emotion&mdash;After another pau&s;e to re|cover &s;trength he thus went on.</P>
<Q>The reque&s;t which I have to make, my dear Mi&s;s Beauclerk, may, per|haps, be incon&s;i&s;tent with your very refined notions of delicacy&mdash;but con|&s;ider that &s;ome indulgences are due to your friends, and that I am entitled to your good wi&s;hes, though I have no claim to your love; by the&s;e wi&s;hes therefore, by the genero&s;ity of your temper, by all your regards in this world, and by all your hopes in the next, I conjure you to oblige me&mdash;&mdash;O!

<P>O! good God, my dear mama, it was his will, his&mdash;will&mdash;had the uni|ver&s;e been offered me I could not touch it&mdash;my &s;en&s;ibility now became audible</P>
<P>I quite &s;obbed, yet, &s;carcely knowing what I did, I di&s;engaged my hand from his, and, falling down upon my knees by the bed-&s;ide, cried out,
<Q>O &s;pare me, Sir,&mdash;&s;pare me&mdash;this is too much&mdash;indeed it is.</Q>
&mdash;At the &s;ame time &s;inking my face upon the bed cloaths, wholly unable to look up, as if I was con&s;cious of &s;ome manife&s;t impropriety&mdash;To be &s;ure, madam, it was very wrong in me to let him &s;ee how much I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;But what could I do&mdash;Con|&s;ider

<P>The colonel, madam, &s;eemed greatly affected by my emotion; and, by endea|vouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t me up, occa&s;ioned me to ri&s;e con&s;iderably &s;ooner than what I would have done had he made u&s;e of the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties; for the mo|ment I found him exerting him&s;elf to that purpo&s;e I recollected his wound, and was in&s;tantly in my former &s;itua|tion, notwith&s;tanding my cheeks were vi&s;ibly &s;tudded over with tears; and notwith&s;tanding my perturbation was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to furni&s;h a man of his fine &s;en&s;e with &s;ome rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picions of

the cau&s;e&mdash;Be this as it may, he pre&s;&s;ed my hand to his lips with an air of inex|pre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s; and, apologizing for the unea&s;ine&s;s which he had given me, he continued to enforce his reque&s;t with &s;o much vehemence, and to declare in &s;o po&s;itive a manner that he could never enjoy a moment's peace unle&s;s I gratified him in this point, that I told him I would con&s;ider the matter a little far|ther, and give him an an&s;wer in two or three days&mdash;
<Q>Two or three days, Har|riot!</Q>
replied he with a mixture of &s;orrow and &s;urprize,
<Q>Two or three days! Suppo&s;e that in this time I &s;hould be taken off&mdash;Your an&s;wer then will be a little of the late&s;t, and I &s;hall go out of the world without my principal con&s;olation&mdash;The thing and the time require an immediate determination; and my rea&s;on for mentioning it to you at all, is to prevent the ra&s;hne&s;s of your

to the wretched Loui&s;a. Talking, my dear Mi&s;s Beauclerk, I find becomes inconvenient to me&mdash;Indulge me therefore at once, and con&s;ider, that to be generous, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, may be the highe&s;t in&s;tance of barba|rity.</Q></P>
<P>Whether I was right or wrong, my dear mama, you mu&s;t determine; but, unable to re&s;i&s;t his &s;olicitations any longer, I took the paper with a reluctant hand; and, in my confu&s;ion, putting it into my bo&s;om in&s;tead of my pocket, the colonel &s;eemed tran&s;ported at the action, ki&s;&s;ed my hand a thou&s;and times, and declared he could now quit the world with content. All the time I was &s;inking under a load of equal awkward|ne&s;s and anxiety, till the &s;urgeons hap|pily coming in, gave me an opportunity of retiring, and unlading the fullne&s;s of my heart in a fre&s;h &s;hower of tears.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">The good Mrs. Mildmay, knowing that I had been a con&s;iderable while in the colonel's apartment, came up to my room; and, finding my eyes extremely red, &s;he threw her kind arms round my neck, and calling me by the tendere&s;t appellations you can conceive, told me &s;he had been long &s;en&s;ible that her &s;on was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with me; and that &s;he al&s;o had been long &s;en&s;ible, not|with&s;tanding my delicate re&s;erve, (&s;o &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay) that I con&s;idered him with an eye of affection&mdash;
<Q>But my &s;weet girl, my dear Harriot,</Q>
conti|nued &s;he, finding me di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed at this information,
<Q>don't imagine I have &s;een this mutual re|gard with any other regret, but my fear, that Mr. Mildmay would not be propitious to the happine&s;s of his &s;on: for my own part, I am &s;o convinced of your worth, that the colonel has an additional &s;hare in my regard on
<PB N="94" REF="96">
account of his attachment to you; and, could I but prevail upon his father, I &s;hould &s;till have a daughter no le&s;s dear in my e&s;timation than the mi&s;er|able Loui&s;a&mdash;But, my love, this fa|mily&mdash;pride &s;o runs away with my poor Mr. Mildmay's good &s;en&s;e, that I de&s;pair of making him &s;acrifice the &s;ugge&s;tions of his vanity to the &s;entiments of his rea&s;on: his mind has been always taken up with an idea of making his children great; and, &s;o he could gain them an empty title, he payed but little con&s;ideration to what might &s;ecure their felicity.</Q></P>
<P>And thus, my dear mama, are matters at pre&s;ent &s;ituated; and thus, all the time that I have been &s;uppo&s;ing my af|fection for the colonel a &s;ecret, this ex|cellent woman has &s;een into the mo&s;t latent rece&s;&s;es of my heart, and even kindly &s;ympathized with my anxiety.
<PB N="95" REF="97">
You may be &s;ure, madam, that, after this exce&s;&s;ive goodne&s;s had a little embold|ened me, I made her acquainted with every circum&s;tance which pa&s;&s;ed with the colonel, though I &s;carcely knew how to mention the affair of the will, as I thought &s;he might fancy me on that account an enemy, though an involun|tary one, to the intere&s;t of her family&mdash;But Mrs. Mildmay, madam, is a coun|terpart of your&s;elf; &s;he has a &s;oul inca|pable of li&s;tening to any little con&s;idera|tions, and ob&s;erves the practice of gene|ro&s;ity too much in her own conduct not to love it in other people's&mdash;As I went on with my &s;tory &s;he was gradually af|fected&mdash;her heart laboured&mdash;and her eye ro&s;e in perfect uni&s;on to mine; and, upon the conclu&s;ion of my narrative, "Harriot," &s;ays &s;he,

occa&s;ion; and I think you would have acted rather below the dignity of your character, had you not conde&s;cended to oblige him; but, notwith&s;tanding the little likelihood of pre&s;ent appear|ances, I have yet a dawn of hope which beams acro&s;s my bo&s;om, and a&s;&s;ures me you &s;hall one day be happy with the colonel&mdash;Had the unfortunate Loui&s;a&mdash;But why do I afflict my&s;elf with recollecting a creature who now has really di&s;honoured us&mdash;Her &s;can|dalous elopement, in the very moment of her &s;eeming penitence, argues an uncommon turpitude of &s;entiment; and &s;hews that her fir&s;t indi&s;cretion was not &s;o much the con&s;equence of an extravagant tenderne&s;s for her lover, as the re&s;ult of her natural de|pravity. God will, I hope, however, forgive the unhappy wretch her guilt, and mercifully incline to &s;well the
<PB N="97" REF="99">
enormity of her crime, by putting down her death to my account.</Q></P>
<P>My unhappy Loui&s;a!&mdash;You may be &s;ure, my dear mama, I did what I po&s;&s;i|bly could to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the venerable Mrs. Mildmay, at the &s;ame time that I &s;aid every thing which could extenuate the &s;eeming mi&s;behaviour of my friend; the good old lady &s;eemed willing to catch at any twig of proba|bility which might keep her hopes en|tirely from &s;inking; but, alas! the fatal force of appearances rendering the very &s;tronge&s;t quite unequal to the ta&s;k, &s;he changed the conver&s;ation, and a&s;ked me if I had any &s;cruple to &s;hew her the colonel's will&mdash;I replied, that I could have no &s;cruple to &s;hew her any thing, as I was &s;en&s;ible &s;he could never have a de&s;ire that was not founded on the &s;tricte&s;t propriety; and therefore imme|diately produced it from my bo&s;om&mdash;
<PB N="98" REF="100">
"My dear," &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>you are very good; and yet be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould not make this reque&s;t on any account, was I not convinced that you wi&s;h as cordially as my&s;elf that the te&s;tator's recovery may prevent the will from being ever carried into execution.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, madam, (returned I)&mdash;"Harriot," interrupted &s;he,
<Q>let minds that doubt each other's candour break out into profe&s;&s;ions of regard, and &s;entimental exclamations; it is below us, however, my love, to enter into a vindication of our motives, &s;ince any argument to prove them ju&s;t would be tacitly to acknowlege that it was po&s;&s;ible for them to be otherwi&s;e. We will not, my deare&s;t girl, even wrong the rectitude of our own principles by implication; nor be the fir&s;t to deny our&s;elves that merit which has been hitherto granted us by every
<PB N="99" REF="101">
body el&s;e.</Q>
&mdash;So &s;aying, &s;he opened the will, which is very &s;hort, containing little more than a general rea&s;on for the colonel's appointing me his heir; and leaving a miniature of him&s;elf &s;et in diamonds to his mother; his hor&s;es, arms, and watch, to his father; his li|brary to Loui&s;a; a diamond ring to your&s;elf; &s;ome trifling remembrances to other friends; and his cloaths and about two hundred pounds among the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Short as the will was, my dear mama, I could &s;carcely &s;tand the &s;hock of read|ing it; there is &s;omething &s;o awful in a will, you know, even where one's &s;elf is not concerned; but when it is made by a per&s;on for whom one entertains an e&s;teem; when a partiality is ab&s;olutely &s;hewn in one's own favour; and when there is another per&s;on by, who is infi|nitely more entitled to a preference; it
<PB N="100" REF="102">
mu&s;t be inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us if we are not wholly dive&s;ted of &s;entiment and delicacy. You cannot, therefore, imagine my confu&s;ion, when I found the colonel had left me two thou&s;and pounds in money; the magnificent &s;ervice of plate, which had been his godfather, Harley's; and the Buckingham&s;hire e&s;tate, which is &s;even hundred pounds a year, and which was formerly his great aunt Ingold&s;by's. Mrs. Mildmay &s;aw my anx|iety, and kindly pitied it; re&s;toring me the paper, and acknowleging &s;he had been to blame in &s;uffering her curio&s;ity to carry her &s;o far&mdash;
<Q>But, my dear Harriot,</Q>
&s;ays &s;he,
<Q>a mother will pay but little attention to decorum in any thing which concerns the conduct of her children.</Q>
After this, we had a long conver&s;ation about the colonel, in which Mrs. Mildmay &s;eemed &s;o high|ly plea&s;ed with his behaviour to me, that I was &s;omewhat re-a&s;&s;ured, and
<PB N="101" REF="103">
had fre&s;h opportunities of admiring the greatne&s;s of her genero&s;ity. Notwith|&s;tanding this, the circum&s;tances of the will rendered me exce&s;&s;ive awkward, till we were flattered with &s;ome certain hopes of the colonel's recovery. From that moment I breathed a free-er air, and con&s;idered my&s;elf as le&s;s an inter|loper in the family; he is now, thank God, in a very fine way, and has borne the fre&s;h &s;hock of his &s;i&s;ter's abrupt de|parture, with a much greater &s;hare of fortitude than could be expected.</P>
<P>And now, my dear mama, how do you do, and what do you &s;ay to the boldne&s;s of your girl, in thus pre&s;uming to talk to you upon &s;uch a point as the foregoing &s;ubject? Do you condemn her of temerity, or approve her for candour; do you imagine that &s;he has grown forward on your indulgence, or do you think that &s;he has made only a

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. <HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD <HI>to</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>VIENNA,
<DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is in vain, my dear Melmoth, I find, for your unfortunate friend to continue any longer abroad: the change of country in no manner tends to alle|viate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his bo&s;om, nor era&s;es in the lea&s;t the form of that amiable wretch, that Mi&s;s Mildmay, from his recollection. If po&s;&s;ible, &s;he gives him every moment an additional pang; and, till he becomes utterly de|prived both of memory and &s;en&s;e, he mu&s;t feel the &s;harpe&s;t affliction on her account.</P>
<P>In reality, Charles, though it is now twelve months &s;ince the infamous flight
<PB N="106" REF="108">
of that unfortunate girl, I am rather more wretched than ever&mdash;She is con|tinually pre&s;ent to my imagination; and I find, in &s;pite of my pride and my rea&s;on, that &s;he holds an ab&s;olute empire over my heart, and that I mu&s;t actually cea&s;e to live before I can actually cea&s;e to love her. Don't de&s;pi&s;e me, how|ever, my dear Melmoth&mdash;I blu&s;h for my own ba&s;ene&s;s, in &s;uffering the a|bandoned woman even to &s;teal a &s;ingle in&s;tant upon my thoughts; but, alas! the more I would bani&s;h her, the more forcible &s;he returns; and I am di&s;tracted with a perpetual round of tenderne&s;s and &s;hame; of pity and indignation: wherever I go I am torn with a variety of oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions; and, to u&s;e the language of poor Sciolto,
<Q>All within is anarchy and uproar."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="109">How, Melmoth, when I received your fir&s;t letter at Rotterdam, did my &s;oul exult in the expectation of being com|pletely happy with Loui&s;a! The mo&s;t di&s;tant in&s;inuation of that delicacy which originally cau&s;ed all our misfortunes, was then argued down into &s;ilence; and the univer&s;al joy which I thought would flow from a reconciliation, added to the tumultuous tide of tran&s;port that &s;welled about my heart from a &s;till more na|tural cau&s;e, gave me an ab&s;olute fore|ta&s;te of ely&s;ium.&mdash;But Providence thought proper, by an accident which I con&s;idered, at that time, as the greate&s;t of all calamities, to &s;natch me from the &s;miling de&s;truction, and graciou&s;ly counteracted the warmth of my wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve me from everla&s;ting di&s;grace&mdash;O! Melmoth, had I been married to her before this fortunate di&s;covery of her infamy&mdash;think what would have been the con&s;equence!&mdash;To the remote&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="110">
confine of the world I had pur&s;ued her; and, as Othello &s;ays,
<Q><L>Had all her hairs been lives, my great revenge</L>
<L>Had &s;tomach for them all!</L></Q>
In fact, Charles, I &s;hould have proceed|ed upon &s;ome immediate act of de&s;pera|tion; and, perhaps, after I had &s;acrificed her to the ju&s;tice of my re&s;entment, it is more than probable I had been tempt|ed to lay violent hands on my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, however, my dear friend, from the conduct of this unhappy wretch, how much rea&s;on I had for &s;up|po&s;ing that the woman who deviates from the rules of virtue with one man, will have very little &s;cruple to indulge the licentious turn of her di&s;po&s;ition with another; you &s;ee what rea&s;on I had to &s;et Loui&s;a's crime down to the ac|count of genuine con&s;titution, in&s;tead of attributing it to the weakne&s;s of an
<PB N="109" REF="111">
extravagant love&mdash;But your women of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, Charles, are continually falling in love; every fre&s;h object in|&s;pires a fre&s;h de&s;ire; and when they have once conquered that exalted deli|cacy of &s;entiment, which is the principal bulwark of their honour, they give an unbounded licen&s;e to enjoyment; and imagine that, &s;ince they have been fami|liar with one per&s;on, there can be no ad|dition to their guilt by an equal famili|arity with all. Thus, in&s;tead of an en|deavour to recover the hallowed paths of innocence, they make a &s;ingle indi&s;|cretion an excu&s;e for the commi&s;&s;ion of a thou&s;and; and indulge every ri&s;ing gu&s;t of inclination, by arguing them|&s;elves into a belief that it cannot in the lea&s;t increa&s;e the infamy of their cha|racters.</P>
<P>You plea&s;ed me extremely by your re|peated accounts of colonel's Mildmay's

perfect recovery. Poor fellow, he now &s;ees for what a worthle&s;s woman he ventured his life; and tho&s;e mad-headed puppies that are for re&s;enting the ruin of a &s;i&s;ter, impatient to be ruined, and one who places the principal of all feli|cities in her ab&s;olute de&s;truction, will, I hope, be warned by Loui&s;a's conduct, from hazarding their throats whenever a profligate hu&s;&s;ey thinks proper to throw away her reputation. Is it not, however, &s;urprizing, that, in all this time, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t dili|gent &s;earch of the Mildmay hou&s;e, no account what&s;oever can be heard of their delicate daughter? But I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is in &s;ome &s;ecluded corner of the kingdom, wallowing in the &s;tye of un|bounded pro&s;titution, and even enter|taining &s;ome underbred &s;coundrel of a keeper with the pangs which her in|famous flight has thru&s;t into the bo&s;om of her mi&s;erable family&mdash;O! for &s;ome

one half, one fiftieth part of that hell which his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her has kindled in this brea&s;t, and which is at this mo|ment furiou&s;ly blazing for revenge.</P>
<P>Yet, Charles, what have I to do with this abandoned woman&mdash;what is her in|famy to me?&mdash;I'll talk no more of her&mdash;I'll think no more of her&mdash;I'll &s;tab her idea to the heart if it ever ri&s;es again to my imagination&mdash;I'll&mdash;Alas! my dear Melmoth,&mdash;I can talk of nothing el&s;e&mdash;I can think of nothing el&s;e; and ba&s;e, polluted, pro&s;titute as &s;he is&mdash;I will not an&s;wer, but what &s;he might yet find it po&s;&s;ible to argue me into an opinion of her innocence; and per&s;uade me, even again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of my own conviction, into &s;uch a belief of her purity as would induce me to forget every thing which is pa&s;t, and urge me to &s;natch her again to my bo&s;om, with all the pa&s;&s;ionate phrenzy of a de&s;perate

love&mdash;O! Melmoth, had you ever &s;een her&mdash;had you ever heard her talk&mdash;But I will drop the &s;ubject, I will &s;peak of &s;omething el&s;e; and only ob&s;erve that the greate&s;t of all cur&s;es, is to doat upon the object of our utmo&s;t con|tempt; and to feel an invincible fondne&s;s in our hearts, for what our rea&s;on points out as an everla&s;ting mark of dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>I have by this po&s;t wrote to my &s;i&s;ter, and informed her of my intention to comply immediately with her wi&s;hes, and return home; Edwards has orders to prepare every thing for my depar|ture, and in &s;ix weeks or a couple of months, I flatter my&s;elf with a hope of finding you in high &s;pirits, and in good health. You, my dear Melmoth, and that exalted woman, lady Haver&s;ham, &s;hall have the direction of my future life&mdash;You are people upon who&s;e friend|&s;hip

I can &s;afely rely, and notwith&s;tand|ing all the parade which is made about a knowledge of the world, I am not &s;atisfied but what the integrity of our friends is much more e&s;&s;ential to our welfare, than their knowledge of man|kind&mdash;But a truce with philo&s;ophical reflections.</P>
<P>What you tell me in relation to my &s;i&s;ter's refu&s;al of lord Winworth, does not at all &s;urprize me&mdash;A woman of eight and twenty with a prodigious for|tune, a fine per&s;on, and &s;uch a mind as lady Haver&s;ham's, cannot fail of hav|ing a number of admirers&mdash;But I am &s;atisfied de&s;erving as tho&s;e admirers may be, &s;he will never think of changing her &s;ituation&mdash;I know Theodo&s;ia po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es a delicacy of mind, perhaps, &s;upe|rior to all the re&s;t of her &s;ex; and am &s;en&s;ible, however, &s;he may re&s;pect the matrimonial union, that &s;he is no friend

<P>AND have I at la&s;t the un&s;peakable happine&s;s of writing once more to my dear Harriot, does &s;he &s;till ac|knowledge me for her friend; or does &s;he join in the general obloquy which the whole world mu&s;t naturally throw upon a my&s;terious ab&s;ence of above eleven months, at a time too that the mo&s;t criminal levity of conduct had bani&s;hed me from the protecting arms of parental affection, and ca&s;t me out in the full face of the whole univer&s;e, as a di&s;grace to my &s;ex, and a &s;candal to my family. O! Harriot, it will be no more than what I expect if you &s;hould
<PB N="117" REF="119">
both de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t me&mdash;Yet when my &s;tory, my melancholy &s;tory comes to be related; when you find how ba&s;ely, how cruelly I have been betrayed; I know your tender heart will bleed at what I have &s;uffered, and I know al&s;o that the genero&s;ity of your di&s;po&s;ition will be &s;en&s;ibly affected if during a period in which I have been mo&s;t entitled to your pity, I have been materially le&s;&s;en|ed in your e&s;teem. To begin then at once, know that the &s;pecious, the &s;anc|tified Mrs. Darnel, who had &s;uch obli|gations to our family, and in who&s;e hou&s;e I was to find &s;o certain an a&s;ylum, is a fiend of darkne&s;s, an in&s;trument of hell, a prie&s;te&s;s of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t day or two of my re&s;i|dence at her hou&s;e, after I was turned out from my father's, &s;he &s;eemed &s;o heartily touched with my misfortune, and &s;o immediately intere&s;ted in my
<PB N="118" REF="120">
welfare, that ab&s;tracted from the clo&s;ene&s;s of our relation, &s;he acquired a con&s;i|derable &s;hare of my e&s;teem, and I could not help con&s;idering her as a woman of unbounded good nature, who was kindly appointed by the pitying hand of Providence to mitigate the &s;everity of my affliction&mdash;Actuated by this opinion, I made her acquainted with my whole heart, and determined as &s;he had the character of being extremely &s;en&s;ible, and devout, to regulate my conduct en|tirely by her advice, till I &s;hould be happily ble&s;t with the forgivene&s;s of my father.</P>
<P>I had not, however, been at her hou&s;e above three days, when &s;he began to alter her tone a little; in&s;tead of la|menting the unhappy &s;tep I had taken, as &s;he did fir&s;t, &s;he &s;poke of it with more and more indifference; and at la&s;t pretty plainly in&s;inuated, that I had
<PB N="119" REF="121">
erred rather again&s;t the &s;everities of cu&s;tom, than the laws of morality&mdash;that the very be&s;t women in the kingdom had not always been able to pre&s;erve them&s;elves un&s;ullied; and that it was even idle to di&s;tre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o much on account of a &s;lip, which &s;he her&s;elf knew would not be in the lea&s;t prejudi|cial to my fortune. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed to hear a woman, of who&s;e delicacy in matters of reputation I entertained the highe&s;t opinion, &s;o ea&s;ily reconciled to an action I con&s;ider|ed as criminal, as it was &s;candalous, and to be no le&s;s repugnant to the principles of virtue than the cu&s;toms of &s;ociety. I therefore continued &s;ilent &s;ome mo|ments, hoping that I had mi&s;con|ceived her meaning, and expecting that &s;he would explain her&s;elf more to my &s;atisfaction: but here I was totally di&s;|appointed; for mi&s;taking my &s;ilence as a mark of my approbation, &s;he ventured
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to be &s;till more explicit, and delivered her&s;elf to the following purpo&s;e, with an air half gay, half &s;erious; yet care|fully attending through the whole, to the various changes of my countenance.</P>
<P><Q>Indeed, my dear Mi&s;s Mildmay, to be candid with you, I cannot imagine however widely I differ from the &s;en|timents of the righteous over much; that the indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions is any way repugnant to the laws of morality&mdash;I &s;hall grant that the indul|gence of them in a manner conforma|ble to the practice of one's country is the mo&s;t eligible mode; but where people are not married, human nature, as the poet &s;ays, will be human nature; and a ca&s;ual lap&s;e from the rigid rules of form mu&s;t be &s;ometimes expected. Come my dear,</Q>
continued the un|blu&s;hing creature,
<Q>taking hold of my hand, that Harold is a villain, but if
<PB N="121" REF="123">
you will be governed by me, your little affair with him &s;hall by no means de|prive you of a good hu&s;band. You recollect your old admirer Sir Harry Ha&s;tings, Sir Harry pa&s;&s;ionately loves you, and has followed you up to town, to make another tendre of a heart, which has long been devoted to your &s;ervice; he is my intimate acquaint|ance, and has in fact reque&s;ted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and if you have no objection &s;hall drink tea with us this evening.</Q></P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my dear Har|riot, what indignation I felt during the whole time of this delicate harangue; yet willing to di&s;cover her utmo&s;t de|&s;igns, I endeavoured to bridle my impatience till &s;he had fini&s;hed it. When &s;he concluded, I &s;trove to a&s;&s;ume as unembarra&s;&s;ed a tone of voice as I was able, and fixing my eyes with an unremitting attention upon her's,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
I think this was &s;ometing like my reply
<Q>&mdash;When I was free enough, madam, in obedience to the commands of a mother, to take up my re&s;idence at your hou&s;e, I never expected to be in&s;ulted with a conver&s;ation of this na|ture; I did not &s;cruple to acknowledge that I had been accidentally guilty, but at the &s;ame time I was in hopes Mrs. Darnel would good naturedly con&s;ider, that I was far from being habitually depraved&mdash;How therefore &s;he can &s;o widely mi&s;take my character, or rather how &s;he can act in a manner &s;o unworthy of her own as to become a kind of advocate for di&s;honour, fills me with an equal degree of &s;urprize and affliction.&mdash;When I came here, I ex|pected a friend that would &s;ympathize with my &s;orrows; not a flatterer that would &s;tudy to le&s;&s;en the blackne&s;s of my crime. Human nature as, you &s;ay, madam, may be human nature;
<PB N="123" REF="125">
but be a&s;&s;ured, notwith&s;tanding the error which I have &s;o recently com|mitted, I have no wi&s;hes to gratify by a new &s;acrifice either of my peace or my character; and that I &s;hall never be &s;o lo&s;t to &s;entiment or &s;hame as to accept the hand of a worthle&s;s fellow who was formerly di&s;carded on ac|count of his own profligacy, and who is now mean enough to build his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s upon an opinion of mine. Excu&s;e me Mrs. Darnel&mdash;You have a right to receive what company you plea&s;e in your own hou&s;e; but con|&s;ider that I am under no nece&s;&s;ity of remaining here to be affronted by your vi&s;itors&mdash;I have other relations, madam, in town, who I doubt not will favour me with protection; and if you will only &s;uffer &s;ome body to order a chair I &s;hall ea&s;e you directly of all unea&s;ine&s;s on my account.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">Alarmed at a reply, which I dare &s;ay from my &s;ilence at fir&s;t, &s;he no way ex|pected, Mrs. Darnel &s;eemed greatly &s;ur|prized that I &s;hould put &s;o unaccounta|ble a con&s;truction upon her words; if &s;he &s;eemed to &s;peak &s;lightly, &s;he &s;aid, of a deviation from the &s;potle&s;s path's of innocence, it was on purpo&s;e to re&s;tore me to &s;ome degree of temper with my|&s;elf; and if &s;he had recommended Sir Harry Ha&s;tings to my con&s;ideration, it was entirely from a &s;olicitude for my welfare, that de&s;erved a very different return from &s;uch a &s;everity of animad|ver&s;ion as I had been plea&s;ed to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it with; Sir Harry was a man of good family and large fortune; unex|ceptionable in his per&s;on, and for aught &s;he had ever heard to the contrary un|exceptionable al&s;o in his manners. On the&s;e accounts &s;he did not think him unworthy of my notice; however, &s;ince I was &s;o aver&s;e to an interview with him,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
&s;he would take care he &s;hould never vi&s;it at her hou&s;e &s;o long as I continued to honour her with my company; and that for the future I might be &s;atisfied &s;he would not drop a &s;ingle &s;yllable which was capable of giving me the lea&s;t offence&mdash;Adding, that from the unremitting rectitude of her pa&s;t life there could be no room to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would now become an advocate for di&s;honour; or betray the cau&s;e of that virtue in the decline of her days, which in the giddie&s;t part of her youth &s;he had always regarded as the principal beauty of the female character.</P>
<P>We are all of us, my dear Harriot, ready enough to believe, what we wi&s;h may be true; and Mrs. Darnel defend|ed her&s;elf with &s;uch an appearance of integrity that I was grieved for the tartne&s;s of my reply, and begged &s;he would excu&s;e it on account of the di|&s;traction
<PB N="126" REF="128">
with which my mind mu&s;t at that time be naturally torn. I then let her into a few pa&s;&s;ages of Sir Harry's character, particularly his ruining the two Mi&s;s Nettervilles; his in&s;olent attempt to run away with my&s;elf, for which you know my poor brother would have called him to a &s;evere account had not Mr. Town&s;hend put them both under an arre&s;t; and mentioned &s;ome in&s;tances of his tyranny to inferiors, that had rendered him either contemptible or de|te&s;ted through all the country. Mrs. Darnel affected great &s;urprize at the&s;e accounts, declaring &s;he had never heard of any thing but his attempt to run away with me which could be mentioned to his prejudice&mdash;"Even of that," &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>I heard but vaguely, I however &s;et it down as a proof of that pa&s;&s;ion for you, which he &s;till continues to ex|pre&s;s with the greate&s;t vehemence, and which before I heard your &s;enti|ments,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
I did not know but the family might be induced to overlook.</Q></P>
<P>Matters continued entirely to my mind at Mrs. Darnel's, till lady Haver|&s;ham took her leave of me, and went down on the &s;cheme of reconciliation to the Hall. Mrs. Darnel then began to hint &s;omething of a concern for Sir Harry, and in&s;inuated, though di&s;tantly, a fear, le&s;t the amiable counte&s;s &s;hould prevail in her brother's favour; and le&s;t after all I &s;hould be doomed to the arms of a man who was entitled to nothing but my eternal dete&s;tation&mdash;I again appeared extremly di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;he however, apologized, and we were again reconciled; but the night after, Har|riot&mdash;the night after&mdash;Does not your heart ach with the &s;tronge&s;t apprehen&s;ions for your poor Loui&s;a?&mdash;I know it does&mdash;and I even anticipate at this pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="128" REF="130">
the di&s;tre&s;s which I am &s;en&s;ible you mu&s;t feel upon my account.</P>
<P>Next morning after breakfa&s;t Mrs. Darnel told me &s;he was in a great di|lemma with regard to an engagement, which &s;he had annually at Sir William Nichol&s;on's in the next &s;treet;
<Q>You mu&s;t know my dear,</Q> &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>Sir William and his lady always celebrate the anniver&s;ary of their marriage, and for twenty years I have never been ab&s;ent on that occa&s;ion&mdash;Now I would not for the world leave you alone&mdash;and yet I don't know how to get excu&s;ed if I &s;tay away from Sir William's, this is the day, and there is to be a prodigious croud of company there in the even|ing.</Q>
My dear Mrs. Darnel, return|ed I, you quite di&s;tre&s;s me with your civility&mdash;You mu&s;t on no condition &s;tay from your friends, for I &s;hall be quite mi&s;erable if I think I interfere in the

lea&s;t with your engagements; I in&s;i&s;t therefore ab&s;olutely on your going&mdash;and&mdash;"Well, well," interrupted &s;he,
<Q>&s;ince you are &s;o good I'll go,&mdash;but depend upon it I &s;hall be at home by eleven in the evening.</Q>
The &s;tating of an hour for her return occa&s;ioned a fre&s;h di&s;pute; but at la&s;t &s;he &s;et out, ordering a chariot, which &s;he had kindly &s;et up on my account the day or two be|fore, notwith&s;tanding the &s;lenderne&s;s of her fortune, to come at twelve.</P>
<P>As I was no way inclined to &s;leep I &s;at up in the back parlour, reading Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe; and had ju&s;t got into that pa&s;&s;age where the vile Lovelace at|tempts the &s;anctity of her chamber at midnight, in the hou&s;e of that dete&s;ta|ble mon&s;ter Sinclair.

<P>He was going on in this manner, my dear Harriot, and even proceeding to ki&s;s my cheek, when, &s;ummoning all the fortitude of my &s;oul, I &s;eized him by the brea&s;t, and threw the wretch from me above half the length of the room&mdash;

<P>I would have expo&s;tulated farther with the &s;avages, my dear Harriot, but the vile Sir Harry now made his ap|pearance; and a&s;ked on what account they delayed the execution of their plan; endeavouring to rai&s;e me from the ground at the &s;ame time, and ordering the re&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying me to the coach&mdash;It was in vain I &s;truggled&mdash;in vain I

<P>About ten o'clock, however, I came a little to my&s;elf, and found that I was in a very hand&s;ome bed, that the room was extremely well furni&s;hed, and that there were two female attendants with hart&s;horn, and a number of other re&s;to|ratives, ready to admini&s;ter every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which might be nece&s;&s;ary for my recovery. From the&s;e women, who
<PB N="142" REF="144">
were Sir Harry's hou&s;e-keeper and her daughter, I learned that I was brought to this hou&s;e about four o'clock in the morning; that &s;everal times on the road Sir Harry and his companions were in violent apprehen&s;ions for my life; that the moment they arrived I was con&s;ign|ed over to the care of the women; and that, till within the la&s;t two hours, I had been in the &s;tronge&s;t hy&s;terics imaginable. The hou&s;ekeeper added, that &s;he was &s;ure her ma&s;ter mu&s;t love me with the &s;incere&s;t affection, for he had been like a di&s;tracted man on my account; and had repeatedly &s;worn to lay violent hands on him&s;elf, if my indi&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be productive of any fatal con&s;e|quences. As the women &s;eemed to be not only communicative but good-na|tured, weak as I was, I made them ac|quainted with their ma&s;ter's conduct, told them my name and family, and of|fered to reward them above their utmo&s;t

From this, and &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ions which dropped from the daughter, I found that &s;he her&s;elf was in love with the wretch; and con&s;equently thought it wonderful how any body el&s;e could mention him with the &s;malle&s;t in|dication either of aver&s;ion or contempt.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in my hopes of e&s;cap|ing by means of the women, and find|ing them entirely at the devotion of

their profligate ma&s;ter, I de&s;ired they would help me up, not knowing how &s;oon they might leave me to the mon&s;ter's brutality. They complied, but reluctant|ly; ob&s;erving, that, after what I had un|dergone, re&s;t was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me; and declaring that they were certain I mu&s;t be greatly indi&s;po&s;ed. Indeed, Harriot, they &s;aid true; I was extremely ill; and, could I have removed my apprehen&s;ions of Sir Harry, I &s;hould have followed their advice with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction. When they had dre&s;&s;ed me, or, more properly &s;peaking, when they re&s;tored my dre&s;s to a little order, they led me into the dining-room, and prevailed upon me to &s;wallow two di&s;hes of tea, and a di&s;h of choco|late: after this they withdrew; but the daughter returned in a few minutes after, to tell me that Sir Harry was coming to attend me; and the me&s;&s;age was &s;carcely delivered before the horrid

<P>I was &s;itting in a great chair when he entered; and, thinking it be&s;t to betray as little fear as po&s;&s;ible, I fixed my eyes upon him with an inten&s;ene&s;s of deter|mined indignation; and a&s;ked him how long I was to remain a pri&s;oner in his hou&s;e?

This was a &s;ight which I was utterly unable to with&s;tand; my brain was in&s;tantly on fire; I &s;creamed with a wildne&s;s of di|&s;traction; and, ju&s;t as the clergyman was coming up to me, I &s;unk down lifele&s;s on the floor.

About this time, the na|tural goodne&s;s of my con&s;titution tri|umphing over the fury of my di&s;order, I became &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible, and was called back to the pungent reflections of a &s;en&s;ibility, which made me look with an inconceivable envy upon madne&s;s.</P>
<P>During the dangerous part of my ill|ne&s;s, Mrs. Law&s;on informed me, that her wretch of a ma&s;ter was ab&s;olutely frantic; that he frequently tore his hair, and &s;tamped upon the ground with all the agitation of a bedlamite, &s;wearing he would not &s;urvive me if I happened to die; and raving that the grave &s;hould at lea&s;t unite him to me, &s;hould there be no po&s;&s;ibility of a union with me by any other means. Though nothing was

The&s;e arguments Mrs. Law|&s;on hinted would wind him up &s;ome|times

to a downright determination of proceeding to the mo&s;t ab&s;olute viola|tions&mdash;he &s;eemed fearful of being de|&s;pi&s;ed by his friends&mdash;and frequently talked of pur&s;uing their advice&mdash;but, in the mid&s;t of all his re&s;olutions, the de&s;ire which he had to make me his irrevo|cably, and the dread he was under le&s;t I &s;hould commit &s;ome in&s;tant act of de|&s;peration on my&s;elf if he went to &s;uch &s;hocking extremities, prevented him from executing his horrid de&s;ign; &s;o that when he found I was really in danger, every thought of an illicit na|ture was immediately &s;acrificed to his concern for my recovery&mdash;By this means, my dear Harriot, I very happily e&s;caped every actual di&s;honour; and, tho' his dete&s;table pa&s;&s;ion was the &s;ource of &s;uch exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s, &s;till it was that very pa&s;&s;ion which was the ultimate cau&s;e of my pre&s;ervation.</P>

<P>Sir Harry, and &s;ome of his fellow-liber|tines, had been making merry below &s;tairs one day, (for I &s;hould have told you, that, during the whole time of my impri&s;on|ment, I never once eat a mor&s;el out of tho&s;e rooms which were particularly &s;et apart for my u&s;e) and &s;at up, according to cu&s;tom, &s;o extremely late, that none of them retired &s;ober to their rooms.&mdash;I my&s;elf heard &s;ome of them very noi&s;y on the &s;tairs when they broke up, and there|fore could give a probable gue&s;s at their &s;ituations.&mdash;I don't know what was the matter with me, but that night I would not pull off my cloaths, and only threw

my&s;elf acro&s;s the bed, to indulge my&s;elf in one of tho&s;e melancholly reveries which are generally plea&s;ing to the unfortunate:&mdash;be|tween three and four, however, I grew a little heavy, and had ju&s;t began to doze, when Mrs. Law&s;on and her daughter, who always lay in an adjoining bed in the &s;ame room, as well to prevent me from any po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, as to take care that my apartments were not approached by any of her ma&s;ter's friends, gave a vio|lent &s;hriek, and, jumping out of bed with the utmo&s;t precipitation, exclaimed, that the hou&s;e was in flames. It was now about the beginning of October, and wanted a con&s;iderable while to day. I &s;tarted up, and found the matter ju&s;t as they repre&s;ented it, the fire blazing fiercely through the windows; and the &s;ervants, who were by this time alarmed, were &s;ome of them unlocking the &s;treet door, and unbolting the parlour windows, while
<PB N="163" REF="165">
others were bu&s;ied in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their intox|icated ma&s;ters out of bed.&mdash;This was an opportunity, my dear Harriot, not to be neglected: already dre&s;&s;ed, I took ad|vantage of the general confu&s;ion, and, &s;lipping out in nothing but a black &s;ilk night-gown, while every body's attention was employed on &s;omething el&s;e, I gained the road, dark as it was, and trudged on without knowing, or indeed caring, which way I went, &s;o I could but get far enough from that dete&s;ted Ha&s;tings.&mdash;The only apprehen&s;ion I laboured under, was that of being pur&s;ued and overtaken by &s;ome of the wretch's emi&s;&s;aries, the moment he became acquainted with my flight. But, as if Providence was particularly deter|mined to re&s;cue me from his hands, I was overtaken by a mini&s;tring angel, in the humble &s;hape of a gardener's wife, who was &s;inging with all the chearfulne&s;s of a benevolent mind, and going with a cart|load of vegetables to one of the London
<PB N="164" REF="166">
markets.&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to her at once, told her that I was an unfortunate young woman, who had been carried off from my friends by force about &s;even months before; and that the villain's hou&s;e, who had taken me away, being that moment on fire, I had &s;eized the oppor|tunity, and made my e&s;cape; I therefore begged her protection, and a&s;&s;ured her I would make it worth her while, if &s;he would be kind enough to take me along with her, as I was fearful of being pur|&s;ued, and carried back. The good wo|man, who had ordered a boy that drove the hor&s;es to &s;top the moment I &s;poke to her, replied, that whoever I was, I ap|peared to be in di&s;tre&s;s, and that, &s;he &s;aid, was a &s;ufficient claim to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance at any time. So &s;aying, &s;he let down a little ladder from the cart, and de&s;iring the boy to help me up, I was &s;eated by her&s;elf in an in&s;tant. As &s;he had a lanthorn by her in the vehicle, &s;he could now have a to|lerable

idea of my per&s;on; and, after looking at me for a minute or &s;o, in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive manner &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, &s;he &s;tood up, and taking off a warm jo|&s;eph, in which &s;he was buttoned up her|&s;elf, "Come, madam," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>this is a cold morning; you don't &s;eem much acquainted with this way of travelling; therefore let me help you on with this coat. Indeed you mu&s;t have it,</Q>
(per|ceiving I made a motion to decline being obliged at her expence)
<Q>and you mu&s;t let me tie this handkerchief about your head too.&mdash;Poor &s;oul! how you trem|ble&mdash;but have a &s;tout heart&mdash;I'll be &s;worn, from your looks, that you are a good creature; and, depend upon it, you &s;han't want for a friend, while my name is Deborah Dob&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>O Harriot, how was I charm'd with the uncultivated benignity of this worthy ru&s;tic!&mdash;a tear of gratitude ro&s;e in&s;tantly
<PB N="166" REF="168">
into my eye; and all I could &s;ay was, "Good Mrs. Dob&s;on, I thank you." We had not rode above a mile from Hamp&s;tead, for there, my dear, it was that Ha&s;tings had his hou&s;e, when the hone&s;t, obliging creature's jo&s;eph and hand|kerchief pre&s;erved me almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly; for Sir Harry having mi&s;&s;ed me in a very little time, had di&s;patched &s;ervants every way, I &s;uppo&s;e, in &s;earch of me, not at all attending to the &s;afety of his hou&s;e; and two of them now came up to the cart, and enquired of Mrs. Dob&s;on, if &s;he had met any young woman on the road; Mrs. Dob&s;on replied, &s;he had not; and the fel|lows pur&s;ued their cour&s;e furiou&s;ly on to|wards town, &s;aying, that probably &s;ome|body on hor&s;eback, or in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, had taken her up, &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to walk &s;o far in the time.</P>
<P>You can't think how my heart flutter'd, my dear Harriot, at this rencounter, nor ima|gine
<PB N="167" REF="169">
what a degree of &s;atisfaction the wor|thy woman expre&s;&s;ed at my fortunate e&s;|cape. "You &s;ee, Madam," &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>how lucky it was that you con&s;ented to be wrapped up;&mdash;that jo&s;eph is an old companion of mine; and I &s;hall love it as long as I live, for being the means of your deliverance.</Q>
In this manner we reached Whitechapel, I think &s;he call|ed it, where there is a market kept; and where &s;he had a &s;i&s;ter, &s;he told me, a wi|dow woman, who kept a &s;nug little hou&s;e, and would afford me all the accommo|dation in her power.&mdash;Accordingly &s;he led me directly to her &s;i&s;ter's, who, it &s;eems, was a con&s;iderable dealer in butter and eggs, and was now preparing to &s;et out upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, a mo&s;t comfortable breakfa&s;t of coffee being al|ready on the table, in a neat &s;tone kitchen, amply furni&s;hed with pewter and bra&s;s, of &s;o &s;hining a complexion, as bore the

<P>"Molly," &s;ays Mrs. Dob&s;on to her &s;i&s;ter upon entering,
<Q>I have brought a &s;tranger with me to town this morning: here is a young lady who was carried off from her friends by &s;ome &s;coundrel about &s;even months ago, and kept all that time at the villain's hou&s;e at Hamp&s;tead. The hou&s;e, thank God, was a-fire as we pa&s;&s;ed by; and the young lady, while all the family was bu&s;y about other affairs, &s;lipped out, overtook my cart, and here I have brought her to be taken care of, 'till &s;he can &s;end to her relations.</Q></P>
<P>"God ble&s;s her dear &s;oul," returned the other,
<Q>I &s;hall take as much care of her, as if &s;he was my own child.&mdash;I warrant her poor father and mother have felt many an aching heart upon her ac|count
<PB N="169" REF="171">
&mdash;but come, Madam, &s;it down; let us have a di&s;h of coffee, and then we'll &s;hew you to a bed, where you may re&s;t a little, after the fatigue of your journey.</Q>
So &s;aying, &s;he helped me off with my jo&s;eph and handkerchief; while a pretty, mode&s;t-looking young woman, about eighteen, who appeared to be her daughter, kindly reached me a chair, and &s;eemed &s;tudious for opportunities to oblige me.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t the two &s;i&s;ters, preparing to go away, recommended me to the care of Sally, the young woman of whom I have been ju&s;t &s;peaking, and wi&s;hed me, in a very affectionate manner, a good morning. Before they withdrew, however, I begged to &s;peak to my worthy friend, Mrs. Dob&s;on, in a private room: the good woman readily indulged my reque&s;t; and, if I might judge by the benignity which enlightened her hone&s;t countenance,
<PB N="170" REF="172">
&s;he came with the more readine&s;s, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that I &s;tood in farther need of her &s;ervices. When we were alone,
<Q>My dear Mrs. Dob&s;on,</Q>
&s;ays I,
<Q>you have eternally obliged me; you have been my pre&s;erver&mdash;my guardian angel&mdash;but I &s;hall be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature in the world, unle&s;s you kindly accept this trifle (endeavouring to &s;queeze five gui|neas into her hand) for a pair of gloves.</Q> "Madam," replied the generous Mrs. Dob&s;on, in a &s;tile much above her condi|tion)
<Q>I am no way &s;orry that you make me this offer, becau&s;e it confirms my good opinion of you&mdash;but I &s;hould think very meanly of my&s;elf, if I was capa|ble of taking a reward for performing a common act of humanity.&mdash;God ble&s;s you, my &s;weet young lady,</Q>
continued &s;he, ki&s;&s;ing my cheek,
<Q>and &s;end you a happy meeting with your friends.&mdash;While you &s;tay here, every thing will be at your &s;ervice, I dare &s;ay; and, humble
<PB N="171" REF="173">
as we are in the world, be a&s;&s;ured you have fallen among people, who would rather confer obligations, than receive them.</Q>
Oh, Harriot, the&s;e are the per&s;ons whom your great ones look upon with contempt&mdash;the&s;e are the per&s;ons whom the in&s;olence of the opulence or pomp &s;o frequently con&s;iders as little &s;u|perior to the merely animal creation: yet &s;ee by what &s;ouls they are informed!&mdash;The mind of this woman, my dear, would have done honour to a coronet; yet how many women are there with co|ronets, who would &s;hed the &s;malle&s;t de|gree of credit upon her cart?</P>
<P>After the departure of the two indu&s;|trious &s;i&s;ters, Sally, to who&s;e care I was con&s;igned, advi&s;ed me, in a very pretty manner, to lie down, in&s;i&s;ting upon helping me to undre&s;s, and beg|ging I would con&s;ider my&s;elf at home in their family. I complied with Sally's
<PB N="172" REF="174">
obliging intreaties, and accordingly went to bed; but, alas! my dear, I awoke in a high fever; and was actually delirious before the good young woman's mother returned from market. By the exce&s;s of the worthy people's tenderne&s;s, and care of an excellent apothecary, who, it &s;eems, attended that admirable in&s;titution call|ed the Magdalen, about which you and I have &s;o frequently talked in the coun|try, I was, in as &s;hort a time as po&s;&s;i|ble, recovered from my illne&s;s;&mdash;but, though my health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, my mind was totally unhinged.&mdash;The numberle&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;es which I had of late &s;u&s;tained, joined to the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having been the original author of every misfortune my&s;elf, was too much for me. Ignorant whether my brother was living or dead&mdash;&s;atisfied that my poor father and mother mu&s;t be torn by the &s;harpe&s;t of all anxieties&mdash;and convinced that my Harriot her&s;elf mu&s;t have given me up as a lo&s;t aban|doned

creature, I was continually raving about my fall, and wi&s;hing for &s;ome a&s;ylum, where I might wa&s;te out the remainder of my days in penitence for my &s;in. In&s;tead, therefore, of de&s;iring+ing to write to tho&s;e who would intere&s;t them&s;elves in my behalf, I looked upon the whole world as my irreconcileable ene|my; yet, though I ince&s;&s;antly raved, I was, neverthele&s;s, apparently calm, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. It was in vain that poor Mrs. Dob&s;on, the hone&s;t woman, her &s;i&s;ter, and the whole family, oppo&s;ed my re&s;olution of entering the Magdalen; it was in vain that they a&s;&s;ured me of a perpetual a&s;ylum with them&mdash;I conti|nued inflexible; and what was the ab|&s;olute re&s;ult of my delirium, they, who could naturally judge by nothing but appearances, &s;et down as the con&s;e|quence of premeditated determination; &s;o that at la&s;t they con&s;ented, and I was received, though with &s;ome e&s;&s;ential deviations, from the cu&s;tomary mode
<PB N="174" REF="176">
of accepting Penitents, the good apo|thecary managing matters with as much delicacy as could be wi&s;hed. I have &s;ince, however, learned, that, had any of Ha|&s;tings's people remained about Hamp|&s;tead, to &s;atisfy Mrs. Dob&s;on's enqui|ries; or could &s;he have prevailed on me to give any account of my&s;elf after my illne&s;s, I never &s;hould have entered this place. But Sir Harry's hou&s;e, it &s;eems, being entirely burnt down, the whole family was removed, before her enqui|ries began; and I was &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly bent upon my &s;cheme, that I evaded an an&s;wer to her que&s;tions to my&s;elf, with a degree of cunning almo&s;t wonderful in my circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear Harriot, been in this hou&s;e above three months, and find that my little under&s;tanding is as well e&s;tabli&s;hed as my health.&mdash;I have, therefore, employed my&s;elf for &s;ome

<P><PB N="180" REF="182">I had ju&s;t received lady Haver&s;ham's copy of Loui&s;a's affecting hi&s;tory, which you &s;ent me with your la&s;t, when, all life and &s;pirits, I dre&s;&s;ed for the opera, and happened to be introduced into a box, where an Engli&s;h gentleman was &s;itting alone, with whom I fell into &s;o familiar a conver&s;ation, that I accepted a propo&s;al which he made, of eating a bit of &s;upper at a tavern, after the per|formance; and this the more readily, as his appearance bore an indication of fa|&s;hion, and as, in the cour&s;e of our chat, he mentioned his being intimate with two or three gentlemen of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>When the opera was over, we retired to one of the be&s;t hou&s;es in the neigh|bourhood of the theatre; where, after drinking two or three gla&s;&s;es of Bur|gundy, he mentioned that his name was Sir Harry Ha&s;tings, and that he had a &s;eat in the county of Oxford.&mdash;I need

I was ju&s;t going to break out, and to demand &s;atisfaction for his outrages to Loui&s;a, when, re|collecting it would be be&s;t to hear his own account of matters&mdash;for fear, after all, that Mi&s;s Mildmay might draw up a &s;tory to an&s;wer her own purpo&s;es, and tre&s;pa&s;s a little upon veracity, to exte|nuate the infamy of her flight.

<Q>yes, I am perfectly acquainted with them; and it is, in a great mea&s;ure, on account of that very young lady, that I have quitted England.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, Sir,</Q>
continued the com|municative baronet,
<Q>that I am a near neighbour of the Mildmays, and have,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
for above four years, entertained a pa&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t extravagant na|ture for their daughter&mdash;but &s;ome|how, though my fortune was as good as any other admirer's, and my pro|po&s;als much more advantageous, &s;till &s;ome freedoms which I had taken with the women, created un&s;urmount|able objections to my character, and my addre&s;&s;es were rejected with a de|gree of di&s;re&s;pect that gave me no little mortification. Stung with re|&s;entment at the cavalier manner in which I was treated, and burning al&s;o to obtain Mi&s;s Mildmay, I made a fruitle&s;s attempt to carry her off.&mdash;In &s;ome time after the failure of this de&s;ign, one Sir Robert Harold, (po&s;&s;ibly the gentleman you mean, &s;ir,) commenced an acquaintance at Bath with Mi&s;s Mildmay, and work|ed him&s;elf &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully into her af|fections, that a day was &s;et apart for
<PB N="183" REF="185">
the celebration of their nuptials, though this happy lover was, to the full, as great a profligate as my&s;elf. The family, however, paid dear for the preference which they gave this gentleman, for, before the wedding day, Sir Robert found means to gain the la&s;t favour from Mi&s;s Mildmay; and a quarrel happening between them immediately after, the intend|ed bridegroom fairly took his leave, and left the di&s;dainful Loui&s;a to feel, in turn, every &s;ting of di&s;appointment, and every pungency of di&s;grace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s Mildmay on this was in&s;tantly &s;ent to town, to the hou&s;e of a re|lation, one Mrs. Darnel; and, as I had my &s;pies continually at work, I found out at once the place of her de&s;tination, and followed her in&s;tant|ly, being &s;till &s;o ridiculou&s;ly be&s;otted, that her affair with Harold no way
<PB N="184" REF="186">
le&s;&s;ened either the exce&s;s of my love, or the extravagance of my venera|tion. In fact, what would have damp|ed the ardour of any other man's pa&s;|&s;ion, only &s;erved to increa&s;e the fer|vour of mine; &s;o that, in&s;tead of thinking to po&s;&s;e&s;s her on the &s;ame terms with that lucky dog Harold, I was uncommonly de&s;irous of mak|ing her mine for ever. I wanted to be &s;ure of her; and, notwith&s;tanding I had a thou&s;and times ridiculed other fellows, for &s;candalou&s;ly &s;tooping to patch up a cracked reputation, &s;till I went on, as if her character had been unblemi&s;hed; and felt infinitely more unea&s;ine&s;s on account of her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the de&s;troyer of her honour, than for her actual deviation from the &s;entiments of virtue.&mdash;But I beg your pardon,</Q>
cried Ha&s;tings, interrupting him&s;elf;
<Q>I am tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on your lei&s;ure, by a dull repetition
<PB N="185" REF="187">
of an affair, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly afford you the &s;malle&s;t entertainment. People are apt to teize others with tho&s;e circum&s;tances which affect their own peace; and I never hear Mi&s;s Mildmay's name mentioned, but what I am for entering into an account of my pa&s;&s;ion for her, and a narrative of my various di&s;appointments.</Q></P>
<P>"O, Sir," replied I,
<Q>you cannot oblige me more, than by indulging your&s;elf on the &s;ubject. I am ex|tremely entertained by relations of this nature; and, if there is no par|ticular &s;ecret,</Q>
&mdash;"Secret! Sir," returned my brother baronet&mdash;
<Q>O there is no &s;ecret&mdash;I dare &s;ay, by this time, every thing is public enough in England; and therefore I can have no objection to gratify your curio&s;ity, &s;ince &s;uch a gratification is the highe&s;t plea&s;ure I can do my&s;elf. You mu&s;t
<PB N="186" REF="188">
know, Sir, that Mi&s;s Mildmay had &s;carcely arrived at her cou&s;in Dar|nel's, when the prevailing rethoric of one thou&s;and guineas, and a five hun|dred pound annuity for life, prevailed upon the worthy relation to deliver her into my hands. The price, ex|travagant as it was, I did not matter &s;ixpence; but it &s;eems the uncon|&s;cionable Jezabel was to receive &s;ome|thing very hand&s;ome from Harold's &s;i&s;ter, lady Haver&s;ham, for contriv|ing a method of removing tho&s;e in|conveniencies to which the beautiful delinquent might be expo&s;ed, during her ab&s;ence from her family; &s;uch as want of equipage, and other e&s;&s;en|tial articles.&mdash;The&s;e, lady Haver|&s;ham, as Harold's &s;i&s;ter, could not be &s;een immediately to furni&s;h, as Mi&s;s Mildmay's delicacy would be alarmed; and as Mrs. Darnel's cir|cum&s;tances were narrow, &s;he was to
<PB N="187" REF="189">
receive a &s;ecret &s;ufficiency for the purpo&s;e, and to be properly con&s;ider|ed for her politene&s;s into the bargain. This was the rea&s;on why &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon the exorbitant terms I have mentioned.&mdash;But enough of terms&mdash;let it &s;atisfy, therefore, that &s;he con|trived a fea&s;ible excu&s;e to leave Loui&s;a alone one evening&mdash;that the &s;ervants were all &s;ent out of the way, and that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of four or five friends, who were provided in ca&s;e of accidents, I carried her off to a hou&s;e which I had at Hamp&s;tead, and kept her there for full &s;even months.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Melmoth, &s;ee my a&s;toni&s;hing command of temper&mdash;"Seven months!" interrupted I, <HI>&s;o</HI> calmly&mdash;
<Q>Well, and &s;urely in that time you had opportu|nities enough of carrying your point, either by marriage, or a more expe|ditious
<PB N="188" REF="190">
method&mdash;you under&s;tand me</Q>
&mdash;"No, by all that's good," replied he,
<Q>&s;trange as it may appear&mdash;I was totally di&s;appointed of &s;uc|ce&s;s.&mdash;She was in a violent fever the principal part of the time; and, in the intervals of her recovery, nothing could either per&s;wade or terrify her into an acceptance of me.&mdash;The few friends who were in the &s;ecret, advi&s;ed me to proceed by other means, and laughed ince&s;&s;antly on account of my romantic purity of affection, as they termed it, for a ca&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Their ridicule too was the more &s;e|vere, becau&s;e I had been my&s;elf one of the very wilde&s;t in the whole knot; and had taken &s;uch liberties at various times with the &s;ex, as ren|dered my pre&s;ent behaviour to the la&s;t degree extraordinary.&mdash;There is nothing which we can &s;tand &s;o little as the &s;haft of ridicule.&mdash;I was a

thou&s;and times determined to pro&s;e|cute their advice&mdash;and frequently blu&s;hed in &s;ecret at the littlene&s;s of my conduct, in thinking of Mi&s;s Mildmay for a wife&mdash;Yet my unac|countable love got the better of my &s;hame, and I was terrified from at|tempting any actual violation, be|cau&s;e I knew the greatne&s;s of her &s;pirit; and was apprehen&s;ive, that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;he might lay a de&s;perate hand upon her per&s;on.&mdash;She had re|peatedly threatened as much, and, I am po&s;itive, would have been as good as her word.</Q></P>
<P>"It is wonderful," interrupted I,
<Q>that &s;ome of your friends did not &s;peak of her being with you&mdash;that none of your &s;ervants, as you were &s;o near a neighbour of the Mildmays, did not, at &s;ome time, write to their friends in the country about the

young lady&mdash;or, that the phy&s;i|cians</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>O, the ea&s;ie&s;t things in the world to manage,</Q>
cried Sir Harry&mdash;
<Q>I had &s;ecrets of my friends, as a &s;e|curity for the pre&s;ervation of mine&mdash;my &s;ervants were all true to the back bone, and had been tried a thou&s;and times&mdash;and as for the phy&s;icians&mdash;an additional fee made them as &s;ilent as the grave at any time.</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well," interrogated I,
<Q>and was it po&s;&s;ible that &s;he could e&s;cape at la&s;t out of your hands, without re|warding you for all the trouble which you were at upon her account?</Q></P>
<P>"It <HI>was</HI> po&s;&s;ible," replied Sir Harry,

<PB N="191" REF="193">
one evening below &s;tairs, and we were all pretty well in for it, before we thought of going to bed&mdash;For my part, though I had drank very near four bottles, I had no inclina|tion to undre&s;s&mdash;I therefore took up a volume of Tri&s;tram Shandy, which lay by the bed-&s;ide, and continued &s;o long at this, that nature was at la&s;t wearied out, and I &s;unk in&s;en|&s;ibly into &s;o found a &s;leep, that it was with much difficulty they could wake me, when the hou&s;e was in flames&mdash;for the bed-curtains, by &s;ome means, reaching my candle, the whole furniture was in&s;tantly in a blaze; and the fire, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;pread through the other apartments with the great|e&s;t rapidity:&mdash;in the confu&s;ion oc|ca&s;ioned by this unlucky circum|&s;tance, Mi&s;s Mildmay contrived to make her e&s;cape; and though, the moment her flight was di&s;covered, I
<PB N="192" REF="194">
po&s;ted me&s;&s;engers through all the dif|ferent roads, and even continued an indefatigable &s;earch after her for above two months, I never could gain any &s;atisfactory account.&mdash;Tired out at length with a &s;earch which was pro|ductive of nothing but di&s;appoint|ment and mortification, I gave her over, and quitted England, in hopes that di&s;tance and time would mitigate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my mind, if it could not even re&s;tore my tranquillity.&mdash;So much, Sir, for Mi&s;s Mildmay&mdash;and now I have been &s;o communica|tive, I hope you will not think me impertinent, if I a&s;k your name, and beg to know which part of England is favoured with your re&s;idence.</Q></P>

<P>"The very &s;ame," cried I, running to the door, and bolting it&mdash;
<Q>and you are the Sir Harry Ha&s;tings, who have been villain enough to carry off that admirable woman, in a forcible manner, from her family; and to impri&s;on her for &s;everal months in a hou&s;e, where her delicacy was to be treated with a continued round of outrage, and where the impri&s;onment of her per&s;on was to do an irrepara|ble injury to her reputation.&mdash;Draw,

continued he, al|tering his voice, and coming up fiercely to me,
<Q>You are a mighty proper per|&s;on to commence a champion for the cau&s;e of virtue.&mdash;I carried off Loui&s;a, it is true; and, though I own the ac|tion to be highly criminal, yet is it by any means &s;o poor, &s;o paltry, &s;o de&s;picable, as your conduct in a&s;&s;um|ing the &s;acred appearance of honour and attachment, to break in upon the

<P>Grateful, generou&s;ly-minded creature!&mdash;My dear lady Blandford, you can't think how the tears rolled down my cheeks at this pathetic addre&s;s.&mdash;I re|membered the name perfectly well; and it was the merit of my brother's beha|viour on that occa&s;ion, which originally rivetted him to the bo&s;om of Loui&s;a.&mdash;

You recollect the affair your&s;elf, I dare &s;ay; for I believe I &s;hewed you, as a curio&s;ity, what a well-written letter of thanks I received from poor Mrs. Jen|kins, immediately after I had ordered the remittance, which dwelt &s;o &s;trongly upon the good woman's memory. I rai&s;ed her up, you may be &s;ure, as &s;oon as I po&s;&s;ibly could, and told her, that the young lady whom &s;he had be|friended &s;o much, would, I hope, in a &s;hort time, honour my brother with her hand, as the match was what lay clo&s;e|ly to the heart of both our families.&mdash;She heard me with a look that indicated a wildne&s;s of &s;atisfaction; and, bur&s;ting into a loud flood of tears, ran about the room, crying, "Thank God!&mdash;thank God!&mdash;I have lived to be of &s;ome little u&s;e to my benefactors!"</P>

<P>Having &s;hewn Loui&s;a the letter I re|ceived from her father, &s;he con&s;ented to go away with me in&s;tantly; but begged that Mrs. Dob&s;on and Mrs. Carter would favour her with their company, whenever &s;he took the liberty to reque&s;t it.&mdash;The worthy women a&s;&s;ured her of their immediate concurrence, and we parted with many tears on both &s;ides, after I had left a fifty pound bill for the u&s;e of the charity.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was at my hou&s;e about four days, when her father and her mother came to town.&mdash;The dear girl, though

<P>When the mother and the daughter became &s;omewhat compo&s;ed, the latter threw her&s;elf at her father's feet, and begged at once his pardon and his ble&s;&s;|ing.&mdash;The old gentleman, who&s;e heart was long &s;ince melted, looked at her for &s;ome time, with an eagerne&s;s of &s;i|lent rapture, as if he was perfectly will|ing, yet totally unable, to comply with

and &s;obbed out with &s;uch a violence, that one would imagine his heart was ab&s;olutely bur&s;ting.&mdash;We, therefore, tore him up in a manner;&mdash;but Loui&s;a was rivetted on her knees&mdash;there was no prevailing upon her to ri&s;e.&mdash;After her father was forced into a chair, &s;he turned to her brother, who now hung weeping over her; and, while a large drop &s;eem fa&s;tened upon each of her cheeks, &s;he cried out&mdash;
<Q>O, Harry, what has my infamy co&s;t you!&mdash;Can you&mdash;but it is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;you never can forgive the wretch who has&mdash;but are you actually recovered?&mdash;O what a wretch am I, to involve every body, who loves me, in de&s;truction!</Q>

<P>When I had at la&s;t got through the contents, I in&s;i&s;ted upon Mr. Melmoth's going in with me to the company, as

<Q>O my Nancy, my Nancy,</Q>
rai&s;ed her up in his arms; while her beautiful daughter ran wild to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not knowing what to think of this extravagant &s;ur|prize.&mdash;Not to keep you any longer in &s;u&s;pence, my dear lady Blandford, the company &s;oon di&s;covered, that Mrs. Beauclerk was the long lo&s;t wife of Mr. Melmoth; and that &s;ome very extraor|dinary circum&s;tance had divided them, without any fault on either &s;ide, for a painful &s;eries of years.&mdash;What, however, appeared very &s;trange, was,
<PB N="220" REF="222">
that each imagined the other to be dead; and that the information concerning the death of each, was communicated to the other, by no le&s;s indubitable a chan|nel of intelligence, than Mr. Melmoth's own father.&mdash;Mr. Melmoth's father, it &s;eems, was a great Ea&s;t-India merchant, and intended to give his &s;on a large for|tune&mdash;but the young gentleman fall|ing in love, and marrying contrary to his father's con&s;ent, the old man would not be reconciled to him upon any terms, but his taking a voyage to the Indies, and continuing abroad for an interval of three years.&mdash;Mr. Melmoth, having no re&s;ource for the maintenance of his wife, but his father's bounty, thought it better to accept of the&s;e cruel conditions, than to expo&s;e the woman of his &s;oul to penury and di&s;tre&s;s: he complied, therefore, though with a bleed|ing heart, and accordingly &s;et out in about thirteen months after their mar|riage,
<PB N="221" REF="223">
ju&s;t as &s;he had been delivered of a daughter.&mdash;He had &s;carce reached the place of his de&s;tination in the Indies, when his father wrote over a melan|cholly letter, containing an account of his wife's death, and his child's; and advi&s;ing him to think of enlarging the term of his re&s;idence in that quarter of the globe. This was an advice which, the young gentleman readily pur&s;ued. After the lo&s;s of all that was mo&s;t dear to his wi&s;hes, England became hateful to his thoughts, and he did not return, till two years after the death of his fa|ther; when he had the mortification to find, that the old gentleman had left all his wealth to &s;ome remoter branches of his family.&mdash;Young Mr. Villars, for &s;o I &s;hall now call him, though di&s;appoint|ed in his expectations of &s;ucceeding to his father's fortune, was, however, in very affluent circum&s;tances him&s;elf. Dur|ing his re&s;idence abroad, he had acquir|ed
<PB N="222" REF="224">
immen&s;e riches, and had been left by a friend no le&s;s than eighty thou&s;and pounds to take the name of Melmoth. His property, when he came home, he chiefly laid out in the purcha&s;e of lands; and Bob has told me repeatedly, the va|lue of his e&s;tates is a clear &s;even thou|&s;and a year.&mdash;Yet, though he came home a very young man, and a very rich one, he &s;till avoided mixing much with &s;ociety.&mdash;The company of women he particularly &s;hunned; and employed him&s;elf chiefly in acts of beneficence, and literary re&s;earches.&mdash;I don't recol|lect by what accident my brother Bob and he became originally acquainted&mdash;but, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;parity of years, and the diametrically oppo&s;ite ca&s;t of complexions, he entertained a very high e&s;teem for Bob; and would &s;ome|times, on his account, vi&s;it at my hou&s;e, and be &s;ociable.&mdash;I always re&s;pected him&mdash;I &s;aw what an excellent heart he

Old Mr. Villars would not advance her a &s;hilling;&mdash;and few are fond of cultivating a friend&s;hip with calamity.&mdash;Soured, therefore, at the world, and ab|&s;olutely wretched for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, the moment &s;he found her&s;elf in circum&s;tances, &s;he retired to a &s;eque&s;|tered habitation in the country, and has lived there ever &s;ince in a very private manner, vi&s;iting very few people, and continuing an intimacy &s;carcely at any hou&s;e but Mr. Mildmay's.</P>
<P>Thus far, lady Blandford, Mr. and Mrs. Villars's &s;tory &s;eemed to account for their &s;eparation; but &s;till there want|ed &s;ome probable cau&s;es for old Mr. Villars's conduct, as well as for his daughter-in-law's a&s;&s;uming the name of Beauclerk. Mo&s;t of us, therefore, ho|ne&s;tly

expre&s;&s;ed our &s;urprize, that the con&s;ideration of Mr. Melmoth's marry|ing a young lady without a fortune, could induce his father to practi&s;e &s;o barbarous a deceit upon an only &s;on; and Mr. Melmoth him&s;elf &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed, that his lady &s;hould, without any rea&s;onable foundation, &s;acrifice his name, while &s;he continued to dedicate her&s;elf &s;o religi|ou&s;ly to his memory.&mdash;Mrs. Melmoth blu&s;hed, and only &s;aid, &s;he had her rea&s;ons.&mdash;</P>
<P>"That &s;he had," cried out Mrs. Dob&s;on, (who had been in the hou&s;e &s;ome time, and now eagerly thru&s;t her|&s;elf forward.) I was amazed at the good woman; and, indeed, &s;o was all the company:&mdash;but as &s;he appeared pregnant with &s;omething of importance, Mr. Melmoth entreated &s;he would go on.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">"I will, Sir," an&s;wered &s;he;
<Q>but, fir&s;t of all, give me leave to a&s;k you a que&s;tion or two.&mdash;Pray, do you re|collect one William Dob&s;on, who for|merly was a favourite &s;ervant of your father's?</Q>

<P><Q>And pray, don't you recollect, that, before your marriage with Mi&s;s Nancy Markham, the lady who now &s;tands here, was publicly known, the &s;ame William Dob&s;on one day told you, in confidence, that your father was in love with Mi&s;s Markham, and intended to offer very advantageous &s;ettlements, in hopes that the great|ne&s;s of the propo&s;al, might obviate the difference of his age, and induce her to accept of him as a hu&s;band? Pray, Sir, do you remember this?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">"Yes, Madam," replied Mr. Mel|moth, "I remember it perfectly well."</P>

An a&s;&s;urance of this nature coming from a father, could admit of no doubt; and you might either of you have entered into a &s;econd mar|riage, even before accident had unde|ceived you. In either ca&s;e, the di&s;|covery of the deceit would have only increa&s;ed your di&s;tre&s;s; and in the former, &s;o long as it remained undi&s;|covered, &s;o long he was certain of making you mi&s;erable.&mdash;This was not, however, the whole of his de|&s;ign.&mdash;If he could make your lady

entertain a belief of your demi&s;e, he thought it &s;till po&s;&s;ible for him&s;elf, at &s;ome opportunity, to gratify the hor|rid purpo&s;es of his imagination.&mdash;Though &s;he was his daughter, he &s;till continued to love her; and once, I believe, actually in&s;inuated a pro|po&s;ition that mu&s;t be &s;hocking to humanity.&mdash;This was at a time when her nece&s;&s;ities were extreme, and when he hoped the &s;everity of her &s;i|tuation would le&s;&s;en the horror of his overture.&mdash;But let me hurry from this dreadful part of my narrative&mdash;When he found him&s;elf treated with the ab|horrence which he merited&mdash;when your lady even threatened to expo&s;e him to the world, and talked of ap|plying in&s;tantly to a magi&s;trate, if he ever more came within her doors, he grew outrageous&mdash;he hired ruffians to in&s;ult her; and omitted no oppor|tunity of &s;landering her reputation.
<PB N="229" REF="231">
When, therefore, &s;he retired from London, &s;he found it I &s;uppo&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary to change her name, for fear of his infamous machinations.&mdash;This was what he told my hu&s;band he was fearful of; and it is very fortunate the lady took that precaution; for I have been well a&s;&s;ured, he made every po&s;&s;ible enquiry, to di&s;cover the place of her retreat.</Q>

Blandford, was in a mo&s;t elegant un|dre&s;s, and really looked charmingly.&mdash;Loui&s;a, who was prepared to expect him every hour, was not much alarmed when he was introduced. She and her mamma were &s;itting in the dining room, when he came up between Mr. Mild|may and the colonel.&mdash;I led the van; and Alexander him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of all his victories, I am pretty certain, never experienced one half of my &s;atis|faction.&mdash;You know how I love the recreant, and how I e&s;teem the Mild|mays.&mdash;This happy reconciliation, there|fore, almo&s;t overcame me&mdash;&s;o that in|&s;tead of &s;aying any thing to Loui&s;a on my entrance, I retired to a &s;opha in one corner of the room, and indulged my&s;elf in a delicious flood of tears.&mdash;Bob, however, was all him&s;elf: with an air of the deepe&s;t re&s;pect, yet of the greate&s;t manline&s;s, he went up to the two ladies, and, falling on his knee,

<P>I have been &s;o bu&s;y &s;ince the cele|bration of the&s;e weddings, that the writ|ing of this letter has taken me up a whole week; and yet, long as it is now, and, fatigued as I am with drawing it up, I cannot conclude, without inform|ing you of &s;ome farther particulars.&mdash;Ha&s;tings's wound, ble&s;&s;ed be God, is not mortal.&mdash;A friend from Paris &s;ends word, that it had a dangerous appear|ance at fir&s;t; but that, by the &s;kill of a very able &s;urgeon, the patient will be &s;oon in a fair way of recovering.&mdash;Cri|minal as that man may be, &s;till it is a terrible thing to have the blood of a fellow-creature upon our hands.&mdash;But the vile Mrs. Darnel&mdash;I know not whe|ther it is improper &s;ometimes to be un|concerned
