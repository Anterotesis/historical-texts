<HEAD>PROPOSALS <HI>FOR PUBLISHING</HI> A NEW AND IMPROVED EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY <HI>CHARLOTTE LENNOX.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>AT a very early period of the Author's life this Work was written, and publi&s;hed with all the vivacity and confidence of youth: Elated by di&s;covering that &s;he had traced from whence the immortal dramatic Poet of our nation had borrowed many of his plots, and fond of di&s;playing her critical &s;agacity in &s;hewing that he made u&s;e of the old tran&s;la|tions of CYNTHIO, BANDELLO, and ARIOSTO'S Tales and Novels, and not of the originals, of which &s;he gives a new tran&s;lation in this Work, &s;he was thought by &s;ome to have treated SHAKSPEARE with le&s;s reverence than might have been wi&s;hed. Neverthele&s;s the Public was plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o much merit in the performance, that it was received with very general favour, and was honoured by &s;uch marks of attention, as not to acknowledge would argue rather arrogance than mode&s;ty. The learned Profe&s;&s;or GOTSCHED of LEIPSIC tran&s;lated her remarks into the German language, and the illu&s;trious Dr. JOHNSON adopted &s;ome of them in his edition of SHAKSPEARE. He pre&s;ented her book to the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, depo&s;iting it in the Bodleian library; and quoted it as one of the authorities in his Dictionary.</P>
<P>Now, when the fame of SHAKSPEARE has had con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ions by the labours of various commentators, and when, by a wide diffu&s;ion of good ta&s;te, his works ju&s;tly enjoy a popularity &s;o exten&s;ive, that the world is ready to afford the mo&s;t liberal patronage to correct, elegant, and &s;plendid editions of them, &s;he is willing to flatter her&s;elf that her friends are not mi&s;taken in thinking that her book, entitled, SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED, may now advantageou&s;ly be produced in a more re&s;pectable form, and with the improvements which, at a mature age, &s;he tru&s;ts &s;he can give it: She therefore propo&s;es to publi&s;h it on the following
