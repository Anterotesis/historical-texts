<ARGUMENT>
<P>I VISIT THE BANKS OF THE GARONNE.&mdash; DESCRIPTION OF MY COUNTRY HOUSE.&mdash; FALL IN LOVE WITH CLAUDINE, MY FARMER's DAUGHTER.&mdash;AN ACCOUNT OF MY AMOUR.&mdash;DEATH OF CLAUDINE, AND HER INTERMENT.&mdash;FATAL EF|FECTS OF A BAD EDUCATION.&mdash;REASONS FOR BEING SO PARTICULAR IN THE ACCOUNT OF MY AMOUR.&mdash;I PREFER MYSELF TO ALL MY COUNTRYMEN.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the preceding Chapter I omitted to mention that I made many attempts to &s;ee the DUKE OF
<PB N="2" REF="8">ORLEANS, without ever being ad|mitted to his pre&s;ence; but accident throwing me in his way one morn|ing in ST. JAMES'S PARK, I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, that great Men, like great Wits, have &s;ome|times &s;hort memories, for he either did not know me, or affected to treat me like a &s;tranger. Upon my com|municating ROBESPIERRE's me&s;&s;age he a&s;&s;umed an air le&s;s forbidding, thanked me for my intelligence, and ordered me to return to PARIS im|mediately.</P>
<P>WITH this command I did not in|tend to comply, for two &s;ufficient rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, I was ju&s;t then me|ditating the de&s;ign of looking into the
<PB N="3" REF="9">contents of my ma&s;ter's &s;trong box, and this attention to my own affairs claimed an indi&s;putable priority. Next, as the Police of PARIS would mo&s;t probably have &s;peedy notice of the tran&s;action, and they might en|tertain &s;entiments different from mine about the partition of ef|fects without the con&s;ent of one of the parties, the Capital &s;eemed to me by no means an eligible place for my immediate re&s;idence.</P>
<P>I HAD heard much of the beauty of the Banks of the GARONNE, &s;o I re&s;olved to bend my cour&s;e towards LANGUEDOC. While my carriage was getting ready at CALAIS, I gave the Nephew of DAMIEN, by letter, a
<PB N="4" REF="10">&s;hort account, which I knew would divert him much, of my manner of dividing with the Marquis, and de|&s;iring him to direct a line to me at TOULOUSE, when he was certain I could be of &s;ervice to my country by my pre&s;ence at PARIS. As that could not be, till there was no law left, and every thing put upon a right footing, I knew I could then make my appearance without the lea&s;t danger.</P>
<P>IN the neighbourhood of TOULOUSE I found &s;o many habitations fit for my purpo&s;e, which were then unoc|cupied, that I was for &s;ome time perplexed about an option. A cir|cum&s;tance at la&s;t determined me, to
<PB N="5" REF="11">which I look back at this moment with a recollection &s;o plea&s;ing, that were I to omit a particular account of it, well might I be accu&s;ed of want of fidelity in my Confe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A VERY creditable-looking hou&s;e, with offices in perfect repair, a good garden, plea&s;ant fields, and from the &s;ide of a hill well wooded command|ing a noble reach of the river, in|duced me to make &s;ome enquiries about it. After the grounds had been &s;hewn me by the Farmer that took care of them in the ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter, who was then at PARIS, he told me his Daughter CLAUDINE was within, had the keys of the apartments, and would
<PB N="6" REF="12">have the honour to attend me, if I thought proper to examine them. I never beheld a countenance where openne&s;s, and what is called Hone&s;ty, &s;eemed to be embelli&s;hed by &s;uch come|ly features. An air and a&s;pect &s;o uncom|mon made me, as we walked together, a little inqui&s;itive about his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"HE had lived," he &s;aid, <Q>chiefly in that Province, where he had long been happy with a wife, as good as &s;he was beautiful, but &s;he was now in a better place, where he humbly hoped, when his days were count|ed, Heaven would be plea&s;ed again to unite him to her.</Q>&mdash; <Q>The death of her two &s;ons in the la&s;t war in America,</Q> added he, with a big
<PB N="7" REF="13">tear falling down his cheek, <Q>was too much for her; &s;he langui&s;hed and died of it. I have a daughter left, and &s;he now is every thing to me. She is the pride of my heart, and when you &s;ee her, Sir, I think you will not wonder at her father's fondne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>ALAS! good BERTRAND (for that was the name of my venerable con|ductor), the careful Shepherd clo&s;es the fold again&s;t the wolf, which thou opene&s;t. I followed him to the hou&s;e. From a parlour on the left &s;ide of the hall, a female voice (which the door of the room beingbut half &s;hut I could hear di&s;tinctly) was ju&s;t about to clo&s;e a &s;ong in &s;uch &s;weet accents as might have made the chord of &s;ympathy vibrate, even in
<PB N="8" REF="14">the brea&s;t of a Dutchman. We &s;tood &s;till at the door for a moment. <Q>It is my daughter, &s;ays the old man, &s;he is at her wheel; thus always does her &s;ong beguile her labour.</Q></P>
<P>FINDING &s;he had cea&s;ed to warble, we entered. At our entrance up ro&s;e from a wheel placed oppo&s;ite to an open window which looked upon the river, &s;uch a form as GUIDO's happie&s;t pencil would have failed to equal. I had &s;een, I thought, female beauty in its perfection both in ENGLAND and in IRELAND, but there the con|templation was di&s;tant and hopele&s;s; here I could examine one object at lei&s;ure, unawed by the idea of &s;upe|rior rank, and unattainable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Had &s;uch a form been pre&s;ented to

</FIGURE>
<PB N="9" REF="16">ZEUXIS, he would have &s;earched no further, but taken her for the model of his HELENA.</P>
<P>HER age &s;eemed to be under twenty, and &s;he wore the becoming dre&s;s of the girls of the province, except that her little feet were at their ea&s;e in &s;lippers, and not compre&s;&s;ed by the unyielding texture of the &s;abots of the country. All the ma|terials too of which her habit was compo&s;ed were finer. From the delicate whitene&s;s of her ivory taper|ing fingers, and the beautiful arm above them, it was plain they had never been employed in any coar&s;e or vulgar labour. Such an air of grace and dignity was &s;pread over
<PB N="10" REF="17">her whole appearance, that one might have imagined &s;ome Lady of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction had cho&s;en that dre&s;s for a ma&s;querade, to make love|line&s;s more lovely.</P>
<P>"MY Child," &s;ays BERTRAND, <Q>&s;hew this Gentleman the hou&s;e; he has thoughts of becoming our Landlord</Q>. At hearing this &s;he lifted up her glo&s;&s;y eyes to my tre|mendous face for an in&s;tant, and with a &s;ort of painful expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he could not entirely conceal, as quickly ca&s;t them down again, as if unable to bear the examination of a vi&s;age in every re&s;pect &s;o perfectly un|like her own. For the fir&s;t time in my life I felt a little vexed at my ugline&s;s,
<PB N="11" REF="18">and wi&s;hed in vain for the di&s;gui&s;ing ma&s;k of the Profe&s;&s;or of Population in LONDON. I glanced at my legs, in hopes her looks would take the &s;ame direction; but no, the ground was preferable.</P>
<P>WITH a re&s;pectful inclination of her head &s;he led the way, and I fol|lowed. In every chamber I detained her as long as po&s;&s;ible, a&s;king num|berle&s;s que&s;tions upon points about which I was utterly indifferent, to protract the infinite gratification which I felt in beholding her. When it would have been &s;u&s;picious to have loitered longer, I pretended to be &s;a|tisfied, and we returned to the hall, where we found her father. She
<PB N="12" REF="19">pa&s;&s;ed into the parlour, and left us to conclude our bargain.</P>
<P>To conceal the real purpo&s;e for which every fiery particle in my veins was flaming, I pretended little difficulties about &s;mall articles of ac|commodation, which I knew could be removed ea&s;ily, and at la&s;t clo&s;ed finally with all the terms mentioned by the re&s;pectable BERTRAND. That he &s;hould take care of the land, and his bewitching daughter continue her government of the hou&s;e and &s;u|perintendency of the dairy, were conditions indi&s;pen&s;ible, I may per|haps be accu&s;ed of inattention to my finances for not endeavouring to &s;ti|pulate &s;ome abatement of the rent,
<PB N="13" REF="20">which was very con&s;iderable; but when the Reader hears, that let that have been what it would, I never meant to pay a &s;ingle livre of it, he will agree with me the point was hardly worth conte&s;ting.</P>
<P>MY impatience to be under the &s;ame roof with this beautiful creature brought me next day to take po&s;s;e&s;|&s;ion of my new man&s;ion. I had a hundred que&s;tions to a&s;k, which CLAUDINE only could an&s;wer. A &s;econd in&s;pection of the hou&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;he was my con|ductre&s;s. No Engineer, preparing to attack a fortified place, ever &s;tudied the plan with more care than I exa|mined the doors and pa&s;&s;ages which
<PB N="14" REF="21">led to her bed-chamber. With infinite mortification I perceived, that tho' &s;he behaved to me with great re&s;pect, and invariable good-humour, her aver|&s;ion to look at me &s;till continued. So anxious was I to remove this di&s;|po&s;ition in her, &s;o adver&s;e to my pur|po&s;es, that I tried to &s;often my voice, naturally more rough than BOREAS, into the gentle&s;t accents: nay, I went &s;o far as to &s;it down to a gla&s;s, endea|vouring to model my features into the mo&s;t engaging expre&s;&s;ion of which they were capable. I prac|ti&s;ed a &s;mile, and it made me appear but more ferocious; as to my &s;quint, I found at once it was de&s;perate, &s;o I lo&s;t no time in fruitle&s;s experiments. Nothing but the Pall Mall Ma&s;k
<PB N="15" REF="22">could improve me. In a rage I broke the gla&s;s to &s;hivers, and contented my&s;elf with concluding, that I was born to command, and not to in&s;i|nuate. Self-love is never without a &s;ubterfuge.</P>
<P>As my pa&s;&s;ion for this lovely girl increa&s;ed daily, it was time to think of concerting &s;ome plan to &s;ecure its gratification. Old BERTRAND watched the golden fruit like the He&s;perian Dragon. His pre&s;ence being mo&s;t unpropitious to the &s;ucce&s;s of my amours, it became nece&s;&s;ary to remove him. He had more than once ob&s;erved to me, that the &s;tock of cattle was by no means &s;ufficient for the quantity of my land, and that
<PB N="16" REF="23">I &s;hould lo&s;e con&s;iderably by delay|ing to increa&s;e it. Nothing could be more fortunate. As his &s;kill and probity were unque&s;tionable, I gave him a commi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e for me, in per&s;on, whatever number of &s;heep and oxen he thought nece&s;&s;ary; and the country under the PYRENEES being the place fixed upon where they could be be&s;t procured, his journey thither, and his return, re|tarded too by the &s;low march of my cattle, would unavoidably take up &s;ufficient time to allow oppor|portunities enough for the execution of my amorous operations. Fare|well, good BERTRAND! With the innocence of a Patriarch, thou art gone upon a Patriarch's errand, and
<PB N="17" REF="24">no Angel will meet thee on the way, and turn thee back to avert the woe which is at home preparing for thee. He embraced his weeping daughter tenderly at parting, but little knew it was his la&s;t embrace.</P>
<P>AFTER BERTRAND's departure, pretending I could not bear to be left quite alone in the evening in a place where I was a &s;tranger, I prevail|ed upon CLAUDINE to bring her guitar and play to me, and I detain|ed her afterwards to a little &s;upper which &s;he always ordered for me. I took care that not a word &s;hould e&s;cape me to give her delicacy the &s;lighte&s;t alarm; nay, I talked with &s;uch &s;eeming fervour in prai&s;e of Re|ligion,
<PB N="18" REF="25">Virtue, and on &s;everal moral topics, that &s;he began to li&s;ten to me with &s;atisfaction. When a little di&s;|&s;imulation can an&s;wer a good pur|po&s;e, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, no Philo&s;opher, no Reformer need be a&s;hamed of it. In this ca&s;e, the end was to &s;anctify the means. I talked like what is called a Good Man, that what is al&s;o vulgarly called Evil might come of it; and &s;uch being the motive, the proude&s;t Patriot in FRANCE need not blu&s;h to have con|ducted him&s;elf as I did.</P>
<P>To feel any real re&s;pect for Religion or Virtue would be di&s;graceful to an enlightened under&s;tanding, but to affect it may be &s;ometimes merito|rious.
<PB N="19" REF="26">The name of GOD, or of Heaven, never e&s;caped from the ro&s;e|bud lips of this innocent creature without being accompanied with &s;uch a look of reverence and devotion as proved too plainly how badly &s;he had been educated. An object of di&s;tre&s;s, or a tale of pity, imme|diately called up a tear into her eye, and her fair bo&s;om heaved with &s;ym|pathy. Had I bur&s;t upon her at once in all the &s;plendor of impiety, &s;he would probably have &s;unk under it, like SEMELE under the cele&s;tial panoply of JUPITER, and I &s;hould have fru&s;trated my own wi&s;hes by attempting an injudicious method of accompli&s;hing them. No; my mode
<PB N="20" REF="27">of proceeding was right, and the &s;ucce&s;s evinces it.</P>
<P>THREE evenings pa&s;&s;ed in the harmle&s;s manner I have de&s;cribed already; I re&s;olved to dedicate the fourth to the little God of Love, not ill de&s;cribed by HORACE, <Q>as &s;harpening his burning arrows on an en&s;anguined anvil: Semper ardentes acuens &s;agittas Cote cruenta.</Q></P>
<P>On the fourth, after my un&s;u&s;pect|ing mi&s;tre&s;s had played and &s;ung, and talked of her ab&s;ent father, the time of who&s;e expected return &s;he had exactly calculated, we &s;at down, as u&s;ual, to &s;upper. At Toulou&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="28">I had procured a &s;leeping potion, which the Quack who &s;old it a&s;&s;ured me, would in le&s;s than an hour after its ab&s;orption con&s;ign even the hun|dred eyes of ARGUS to a &s;tate of pro|found &s;omnolency. I was now to make the experiment, for the draught had been carefully infu&s;ed into a bottle of &s;mall weak wine of the country, of which CLAUDINE com|monly drank two or three gla&s;&s;es, mixed however with water, before &s;he retired from the parlour. <Q>O true Apothecary!</Q> cried I, like ROMEO, for her long dark eye-la&s;hes &s;eemed to be almo&s;t weighed down as &s;he was ri&s;ing from her chair to leave me.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">THE apartment where &s;he &s;lept was in a wing &s;eparated from the body of the hou&s;e, and commu|nicating by a pretty long pa&s;&s;age. The key of her chamber was in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and there being no bolt to the door on the in&s;ide, &s;he could not have excluded me, even had &s;he thought any precaution nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>LET any of my Readers, who has felt the gentle flame of Love, judge with what impatience I waited near a quarter of an hour till I was certain of her being in a place fit for my re|ception. With a dark lanthorn, and the torch of CUPID to guide my foot|&s;teps, I traver&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age, and a&s;cended to her chamber. The affected
<PB N="23" REF="30">&s;queami&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome female Critics mu&s;t prevent my dwelling on parti|culars. As the Grecian Arti&s;t, de|&s;pairing to expre&s;s the fatherly an|gui&s;h of AGAMEMNON at the &s;acri|fice of his daughter, concealed his countenance in the picture, &s;o will I throw a veil of &s;ilence over this mo&s;t intere&s;ting tran&s;action. Let it &s;uf|fice to &s;ay, I was contented; I was ble&s;&s;ed even to &s;atiety. All the rap|tures which beauty, in a &s;tate of in|&s;en&s;ibility, could be&s;tow, I enjoyed in the keene&s;t perfection. Having locked the door at the out&s;ide to pre|vent accidents, I retired to my bed, hoping that the &s;weet image of CLAUDINE would not fail in dreams to vi&s;it me.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">NEXT morning, after having conned overa &s;peech full of tenderne&s;s and ac|knowledgments for the favours with which &s;he had never intended to honour me, I mounted to the bower which contained the per&s;on of my lovely de|&s;poiled LUCRETIA. Her cap was on the ground, her bright auburn hair &s;pread over her &s;houlders in wild di&s;|order, and a look of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h and de&s;pair too &s;trongly imprinted on all her expre&s;&s;ive features. As I attempted to approach, &s;he &s;tarted up with an air of frenzy, buried her face in one of the bed-curtains, &s;tamped with her little feet again&s;t the floor, and with an impatient motion of her white arm tried to waft me from her pre|&s;ence. The little &s;peech which I had
<PB N="25" REF="32">prepared, I thought too good to be lo&s;t, &s;o I uttered it, but it only &s;eemed to increa&s;e her di&s;traction.</P>
<P>I RESOLVED to give her one trial more before I proceeded to the la&s;t extremity. My reception was rather wor&s;e than at fir&s;t, and I could ob&s;erve &s;he was fa&s;t verging to a &s;tate of in&s;anity. No time was to be lo&s;t. BERTRAND was &s;oon to return;&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing her to run mad, &s;he might in &s;ome lucid interval reveal the cau&s;e which had impaired her rea&s;on, and there being then &s;ome law in FRANCE, the brea&s;ts of my Judges, perhaps, might never have felt the tender pa&s;&s;ion, and they might advert only to the
<PB N="26" REF="33">fact, without due allowance for the temptation.</P>
<P>WITH that deci&s;ion which always marks a manly character, I took my mea&s;ures immediately. More than three days had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my fair captive (at lea&s;t to my knowledge) had taken any nouri&s;hment; for tho' I con&s;tantly carried up food to her, and of the nice&s;t kind, it &s;eemed to me to remain unta&s;ted. She loved milk, it was her favourite diet. In about a quart of milk I mingled a &s;trong infu&s;ion of the fine&s;t ar&s;e|nic, and left it in her &s;ight upon a table. My tenderne&s;s for her was &s;till &s;uch, that I would give her no|thing
<PB N="27" REF="34">unpalatable and di&s;gu&s;ting. Next day before I unlocked the door, profound &s;ilence within, announced to me her cata&s;trophe. Her face, though a good deal di&s;torted by con|vul&s;ions from the poi&s;on, &s;till retained more beauty than &s;he had left perhaps behind her in the province. A book of devotion lay upon the table before the chair &s;he died in, and a letter from her father I found crumpled up in one of her hands, which I &s;uppo&s;e proceeded from her expiring &s;pa&s;ms; for, poor girl! while &s;he could do it, &s;he was fond of &s;moothing and fold|ing up things very neatly.</P>
<P>SEEING all right, I waited for darkne&s;s to conclude her ob&s;equies.
<PB N="28" REF="35">At midnight I put her, with her fa|ther's letter undi&s;turbed in her hand, and her praying book, into a large &s;ack which lay empty in the granary for corn; then rai&s;ing the whole with one arm, and ca&s;ting it behind me, I trudged towards the bridge at about half a mile's di&s;tance. Light as &s;he was, I continued groping about for near ten minutes before I could find a &s;tone to put into the &s;ack weighty enough to &s;ink her. From the centre arch of the bridge I dropped my cold burden into the middle of the river, li&s;tening to hear it de&s;cend to the bottom; and I will venture boldly to affirm, that earth or water never re|ceived the remains of a more beauti|ful creature.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36">WHO can re&s;lect upon this whole bu&s;ine&s;s without feeling indignation again&s;t early prejudices, and a mi&s;|taken &s;y&s;tem! H ad this fie crea|ture's, this paragon's exi&s;tence been prolonged to the pre&s;ent illuminated hour, how different might have been her condition! Had &s;he but lived to &s;ee divorces &s;anctioned by the Legi&s;|lature, to &s;ee the mothers of a pro|mi&s;cuous offspring pre&s;enting at the Bar of the Nation the li&s;ping pro|duce of their unre&s;trained inconti|nence, and claiming for it public ho|nours and di&s;tinction, how mu&s;t &s;he have de&s;pi&s;ed the narrow notions which Prie&s;ts and Parents had in|&s;tilled into her! In&s;tead of falling a victim to an over-delicate and fal&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="37">&s;en&s;ibility, &s;he would have found her&s;elf rai&s;ed to a higher rank in &s;ociety; and di&s;daining the &s;uper&s;ti|tious forms and ceremonies of Monks and Churchmen, and &s;napping her fingers at the Altar, her&s;elf a free citizen, &s;he might have rai&s;ed up free citizens to her country.</P>
<P>POOR CLAUDINE! I did not wi&s;h to de&s;troy her; I loved her, tenderly loved her, and &s;he died an oblation, not to my inhumanity, but to a mi&s;|taken faith, and to prejudices im|bibed from the nipple. Let the in|dignant world cry out with me, <Q>The&s;e are the effects of &s;uper|&s;tition; <HI>tantumreligio potuit &s;uadere malorum.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">EVERY thing being now fini&s;hed to my &s;atis&s;action, I returned to my hou&s;e, not a little fatigued with my labour, and drenched with rain, which had &s;allen ince&s;&s;antly. A cold roa&s;ted turkey, and above two bottles of the be&s;t wine of Bourdeaux &s;oon re|&s;tored me to my accu&s;tomed vigour, and a long &s;ound &s;leep, un&s;olicited by an opiate, completed the renovation of all my powers.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt more particularly on all the circum&s;tances of the ad|venture ju&s;t recited than upon any other to be found in my Confe&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e I can recur to it with the mo&s;t complete &s;atisfaction. In this atchievement no one can claim a
<PB N="32" REF="39">&s;hare with me: <HI>nihil cohors, nihil turma decerpit.</HI> The idea, the plan, the execution, were all my own. I &s;tudied the characters I had to deal with, and governed them; I watch|ed for every accident, and bent it to my intere&s;t; I fore&s;aw every difficulty, and I removed it. The DUKE of ORLEANS boa&s;ts that he has &s;pread de&s;truction wider, that he has &s;hed more innocent blood than any Reformer of our country. It may be &s;o, bat how has he done it? By money and the agency of others. DANTON, THURIOU, MADAME TEROIGNE, SANSTERRF MERLIN, ROBESPIERRE, MARAT, cannot count their &s;lain. If that be the fir&s;t te&s;t of public virtue, I feel no infe|riority;
<PB N="33" REF="40">I wi&s;h not to depreciate their merits, but let any of them &s;hew me a period of their lives to be compared with my &s;hort re&s;idence on the Banks of the GARONNE. To which would a PLUTARCH give the preference? ALEXANDER had his pa&s;&s;age of the GRANICUS, POMPEY his victory over the Pirates, CAESAR his taking ALESIA, MARLBOROUGH his HOCKSTET; TURENNE, CONDE, VILLARS, SAXE, CORNWALLIS, every Hero has had his favourite at|chievement. Let the Rape and Death of CLAUDINE be engraved on my tomb&s;tone. This, however, may be pre&s;umption; for, after all, not I, but the world mu&s;t determine. Self-love is a great deceiver.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>MY RETURN TO PARIS.&mdash;SUMMARY OF EVENTS PREPARATORY TO THE REVO|LUTION. &mdash;PATRIOTISM OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.&mdash;ADVANTAGES OF NU|MEROUS POPULAR ASSEMBLIES.&mdash;FLOU|RISHING CONDITION OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY thing for my ea&s;e and &s;ecurity &s;eemed to have been arranged in the whole affair with my late mi&s;tre&s;s, of ob&s;tinate memory, by &s;ome power propitious to the tender pa&s;&s;ion. Ju&s;t as her father might have been expected to return (to whom I &s;hould have been per|plexed to account in a &s;atisfactory manner for her di&s;appearance), I
<PB N="35" REF="42">found a &s;hort note from the Nephew of DAMIEN, directed for me at THOULOUSE, in the&s;e words: <Q>The States General are a&s;&s;embled at VERSAILLES; every thing wears the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;pect; the Duke wi&s;hes to &s;ee you at PARIS. Lo&s;e not a moment.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was in the &s;ummer of 1789. In le&s;s than half an hour I was in a chai&s;e with the hor&s;es heads turned towards the Metropolis, and I could not help laughing heartily, while I figured to my&s;elf the wonder and &s;tupefaction of old BERTRAND, when he &s;hould return from the moun|tains with his cattle, and find neither the ma&s;ter nor daughter he had left
<PB N="36" REF="43">behind him. The pea&s;ants about the place, and two poor drudges kept in the hou&s;e for the meane&s;t offices, could give him no &s;atisfaction; and I, the only per&s;on in the &s;ecret, being con|vinced that nothing I could tell him would make things much better, re|&s;olved to leave him to expatiate in the wide region of conjecture, or to look for his con&s;olation to the pro|&s;pect of being again united to his be|loved wife by a &s;econd marriage with her in another world.</P>
<P>OBJECTS of &s;o much greater im|portance then occupied my mind, and have ever &s;ince kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, that this good man, with his herds and flocks, and his beautiful daugh|ter,
<PB N="37" REF="44">never once entered my head till I &s;at down to ran&s;ack my memory for the &s;eries of my adventures, after I had re&s;olved to gratify the public with their recital.</P>
<P>THE glorious events which &s;ince the year 1789 have followed each other in &s;uch rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in FRANCE, &s;eem in a degree to have obliterated the recollection of tho&s;e primary pa&s;&s;ages which prepared the way for them. It will not there|fore be impertinent, in a &s;ummary manner, ju&s;t to touch upon them; and it will appear, that tho', perhaps, all that &s;ublime confu&s;ion and anarchy which have filled mankind with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hment might not have
<PB N="38" REF="45">been expected to re&s;ult from them, yet that they &s;hould be attended with very important con&s;equences was at lea&s;t inevitable.</P>
<P>THAT twenty-five millions of Slaves &s;hould in a few weeks become Freemen, was &s;ufficiently wonderful; but that twenty-five millions of Slaves &s;hould be converted into an equal number of Tyrants, the mo&s;t cruel and &s;anguinary that any por|tion of the globe ever groaned under, mu&s;t appear much more augu&s;t and tremendous; that one of the mo&s;t antient and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed mo|narchies in the world &s;hould be &s;ub|verted almo&s;t before it was menaced; that a King, beloved by his people,
<PB N="39" REF="46">e&s;teemed for his good qualities, and never convicted of one act of op|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould lo&s;e his head upon a &s;caffold; that the proude&s;t Nobi|lity in EUROPE &s;hould be exiled, beggared, or butchered; that a ve|nerable Religion, and its Hierarchy, &s;hould be almo&s;t aboli&s;hed; that pre&s;criptive privileges, rights, laws, cu&s;toms, and property, &s;hould be torn up by the roots and trampled upon; that every thing which was once revered &s;hould be treated with igno|miny, all which was held &s;acred &s;hould be profaned, all that was be|loved &s;hould be dete&s;ted; that the very e&s;&s;ence of right and wrong &s;hould be &s;o confounded as to be no more di&s;tingui&s;hable; and that all
<PB N="40" REF="47">this &s;hould be done by men without wi&s;dom, experience, fortune, abilities, or character, would appear incredible in a fiction, and yet the reality is confirmed by the mo&s;t univer&s;al and undi&s;puted notoriety. LIMA, LISBON, CALABRIA, overthrown and de&s;o|lated by earthquakes, pre&s;ent no &s;uch &s;tupendous objects for human con|templation.</P>
<P>THE foundation for all this felicity was laid by a Mini&s;ter of Finance, who certainly neither fore&s;aw nor in|tended it; by the vain, the elaborate, the ingenious, the poli&s;hed Mr. NECKER.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">FRANCE &s;inking under an accumu|lated load of debt, and &s;till further ex|hau&s;ted by efforts beyond her abilities to &s;upport the revolt of the American Colonies from the Mother Country ENGLAND, was to be relieved by &s;ome great ma&s;ter-&s;troke of policy. The Mi|ni&s;ter ju&s;t mentioned re&s;orted to the happy expedient of a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates general. Their collective wi&s;dom was to devi&s;e &s;ome means at once to lighten the public burden, and to repleni&s;h the Royal Exchequer, two points not very ea&s;ily attainable. No plan hav|ing been previou&s;ly dige&s;ted with wi&s;dom, Di&s;order and Democracy began to take the lead from the mo|ment the States were a&s;&s;embled. Had it been duly promulgated before their
<PB N="42" REF="49">convention, that the three E&s;tates, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Commons, were to form &s;eparate bodies, each to act as a controul upon the other, and that no mea&s;ure was to be ratified but by their triple concurrence, the lowe&s;t would not have had the a&s;cendancy; but the Ordinance only held out, that they were to meet in the &s;ame chamber, and to deliberate all together. There being a va&s;t majority of the <HI>Tiers,</HI> the powers of the other two Orders mu&s;t be at once over-ruled, and rendered in&s;ignificant. Cooped up as it were to be &s;pectators of their own di&s;grace, nothing was left to them but to be placed like cyphers in the account, to increa&s;e the ho&s;tile importance of
<PB N="43" REF="50">the figures which outnumbered them. This it mu&s;t be allowed was a pro|mi&s;ing beginning.</P>
<P>THE King, rather of a lethargick di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;en&s;ible that the people had been much oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed more anxious that they &s;hould be relieved than for the pre&s;ervation of his own de&s;poti&s;m, or for the pri|vileges of his haughty Nobility. The Nobles and the Clergy, though con|&s;cious of their danger, and knowing that they mu&s;t be &s;trengthened by union, did not however unite, nor take any &s;teps to &s;ecure their immu|nities from encroachment, till their very exi&s;tence was in jeopardy. His Maje&s;ty was &s;uffered to go to the
<PB N="44" REF="51">States General before their powers were verified; and the military parade with which this ceremony was at|tended, together with the in&s;ults offered to the Repre&s;entatives, who were excluded from the great cham|ber, by armed guards, on pretence that it was preparing for the Royal reception, only drove them to find out another place of meeting, the <HI>Jeu de Paume,</HI> where they entered into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements never to be di&s;&s;olved but by their own con&s;ent, and declaring them&s;elves the whole Legi&s;lature, to the entire exclu&s;ion of all the privileged Orders. Here we &s;aw at once the Long Par|liament of ENGLAND, in the reign of the Fir&s;t CHARLES.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52">A BLESSED dearth of corn (which was felt at this time) helped to &s;et the ma&s;s of di&s;content into quicker fermentation. Upon this &s;carcity, the Commons invited the Clergy to deliberate with them in the Com|mon Hall upon the means for the relie&s; of the people. Their refu&s;al, which was expected, contributed to their unpopularity, and the que&s;tion was immediately agitated by the Politicians in the <HI>Caffe dc Foy,</HI> Whether it was not lawful for the Commons to de|cree the application of eccle&s;ia|&s;tical revenues towards the relief of the people? or, in other words, Whether they had not a right to take their property from the lawful owners, and give, or pretend to give
<PB N="46" REF="53">it to tho&s;e who had no right to it! It would be paying an ill compli|ment to the under&s;tandings of my philo&s;ophical Readers, to explain to them, that the relief of the poor was not the purpo&s;e in contemplation. Heaven forbid! Our Patriots wi&s;hed to &s;ee them peri&s;h by thou&s;ands; they could be &s;pared: no, to ca&s;t an odium upon an opulent and re&s;pectable order was the object, and to accu&s;tom men to the idea that nothing could be &s;anctioned again&s;t the omnipotence of the multitude. Having often, with a knife or pi&s;tol in my hand, practi&s;ed this method of transferring property for my own advantage, it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that I approved of it entirely.
<PB N="47" REF="54">From this moment may be dated the down&s;all of our Clergy.</P>
<P>IN June 1789, our good friend Abbe SYEYES made a motion, which a little amended was a&s;terwards de|creed: <Q>That if the privileged Orders continued their refu&s;al to join the Commons, the latter would proceed without them.</Q></P>
<P>DURING the&s;e commotions, the Pre&s;s at PARIS, like the Chimera, vomited out &s;moke and fire. The mo&s;t furious and inflammatory publi|cations, to the number of near one hundred weekly, i&s;&s;ued reeking from the <HI>Palais Royal</HI>; and their di&s;&s;emi|nation was &s;uffered, without a &s;ingle
<PB N="48" REF="55">&s;tep being taken by the Government to &s;top the circulation, or to extin|gui&s;h the combu&s;tion. Ge&s;ticulat|ing Orators, in every corner, mount|ed upon benches or barrels, ha|rangued their re&s;pective circles of gaping auditors, and by the mere energy of vociferation and action bade defiance to logic, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all eloquence. The favourite topics of the&s;e popular mountebanks were, the nature of civil govern|ment, and the incompatibility of law and liberty; the &s;upreme power of the people, and their wi&s;|dom; the u&s;urpation of the No|bility and Clergy, not half &s;o well qualified as the populace (virtu|ous though ignorant) for the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="49" REF="56">of legi&s;lation; the enormous expence of Royal e&s;tabli&s;hments; but above all, the multiplied abu&s;es of Government, which it was impo&s;|&s;ible to correct but by demoli&s;hing entirely the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and in|troducing another on principles dia|metrically oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>MEANTIME the Army, which had &s;ucked in &s;ome muddy notions of Republicani&s;m in AMERICA, and happened at his time to be di&s;con|tented with their Commander, the DUKE DE CHATELET, were &s;educed from their fidelity to the Crown by the promi&s;e of increa&s;ed pay and re|laxed di&s;cipline. We knew they
<PB N="50" REF="57">might be our ma&s;ters, &s;o we wi&s;ely made them our in&s;truments.</P>
<P>THE undaunted &s;pirit of THE QUEEN, which &s;eemed to be heredi|tary, was for a time formidable, &s;o the principal popular batteries were directed again&s;t her, and her &s;up|po&s;ed favourite the COUNT D'ARTOIS. Our Demagogues raked into every hi&s;torical dunghill of female infamy, from JEZEBEL downwards, to find materials for loading her character with an accumulation of follies, crimes, and vices. Impo&s;&s;ible as were many of our charges again&s;t Her Ma|je&s;ty, and improbable as were mo&s;t of them, they &s;erved our purpo&s;e full as well as if they had been true, for the
<PB N="51" REF="58">malignant credulity of our good people made their verification unne|ce&s;&s;ary. As to our illiterate Re|formers who could not read, we &s;poke through their eyes to their pa&s;&s;ions. We had Prints exhibiting her in every attitude which a polluted imagination could devi&s;e, and the&s;e were expo&s;ed in &s;hop-windows, in|viting the in&s;pection of every pa&s;|&s;enger. We contented our&s;elves with only repre&s;enting THE KING under the likene&s;s of a Hog wallowing in a &s;tye of gluttonous &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>LA FAYETTE having &s;ome credit with the troops, was &s;uffered to take the lead where military &s;kill and di&s;ciplined numbers were nece&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="52" REF="59">but, he being &s;uppo&s;ed not to be en|tirely devoid of what is called Con|&s;cience and Humanity, was only to be employed as a tool at the time, and to be afterwards removed (as he, DILLON, DUMOURIER, and &s;o many others have experienced), by pro|&s;cription, bani&s;hment, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the <HI>ultima ratio</HI> of all Democratical Governments.</P>
<P>THE demolition of all the PARLIA|MENTS was al&s;o a mea&s;ure re&s;olved upon.</P>
<P>ALL the expences of hired mobs, of bonfires, and rejoicings to celebrate the triumphs of the rabble, and for the di&s;per&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;editious pam|phlets,
<PB N="53" REF="60">were defrayed by the DUKE OF ORLEANS. But the zeal of his Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s was not con|fined to VERSAILLES and PARIS; orders were &s;ent into the provinces to &s;et fire to the hou&s;es and ca&s;tles, and to cut the throats of Ari&s;tocrates; the perpetrators of &s;uch heroic deeds always being a&s;&s;ured of a hand&s;ome gratuity for their &s;ervices from the Duke's liberality.</P>
<P>THE annual revenue of his High|ne&s;s was above 300,000 l. with a rever&s;ion of 175,000 l. yearly, after the death of his Father-in-Law the DUKE DE PENTHIEVRE; &s;o we had a fund of near half a million yearly at our command, which we u&s;ed to
<PB N="54" REF="61">call facetiou&s;ly ANARCHY FUND. And indeed this immen&s;e income, and the &s;ums accruing from plunder, we al|ways applied tovery laudable purpo&s;es: and what perhaps will not a little &s;urpri&s;e, at lea&s;t, a foreign reader, we always found the charges much more rea&s;onable for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination than for perjury, owing entirely to our a&s;&s;ociates being &s;o much more in habits of the former. We paid at la&s;t but a Louis &s;or cutting the throat of an Ari&s;tocrat, while I think the price was not le&s;s than five for &s;wearing a plot again&s;t him. We kept &s;ome of the&s;e ac|counts pretty regularly, as we did not know but the JACOBINS might like to look over them. Tho&s;e who recollect the Duke's conver&s;ation in
<PB N="55" REF="62">the Ninth Chapter, will not a&s;cribe all this profu&s;ion to his genero&s;ity. He imagined he was laying out his money to the be&s;t intere&s;t. On the 25th of June he went over publicly with forty-&s;even of the Nobility to the Commons; many of the Clergy followed him.</P>
<P>IT has always been acknowledged, that Popular A&s;&s;emblies too nume|rous can never deliberate with wi&s;|dom and effect; nay, it has been &s;aid, that even the Commons of ENGLAND, decorous as they are by the ob&s;er|vance of known forms, habituated to debate, and &s;eldom exceeding three or four hundred pre&s;ent, would never be able to come to any determination,
<PB N="56" REF="63">if the bu&s;ine&s;s was not in &s;ome degree prepared by the Mini&s;ter, or other per&s;ons, previous to its introduction among them. We had all the defects and di&s;advantages of a Popular A&s;|&s;embly, in their mo&s;t complete im|perfection. The Hall of Se&s;&s;ion con|tained above two thou&s;and per&s;ons; about a hundred Repre&s;entatives were upon their legs at a time, all talking together, and each bellowing for pre|audience; while the Galleries were employed in clapping or hi&s;&s;ing, hooting or applauding ju&s;t as they happened to like or di&s;like the per&s;on or propo&s;ition of the Speaker. Thus this FREE ASSEMBLY (as it was plea&s;ed to call it&s;elf) became, as we wi&s;hed them to be, and as they have ever
<PB N="57" REF="64">&s;ince continued to be, the organized Puppets and Sub-delegates of the Rabble. Add to this, that their motions were always complicated: &s;ome parts might be eligible, &s;ome not; &s;ome plea&s;ant, &s;ome bitter; &s;ome whole&s;ome, others indige&s;tible; but the Repre&s;entatives were obliged to gulp down the whole, to &s;wallow the &s;tones with the fruit, not knowing how to reject the one, and to retain the other. Ignorant how to &s;eparate or &s;implify their motions, two mea|&s;ures directly repugnant in their ten|dency were &s;ometimes voted toge|ther, and matter &s;o di&s;cordant blended or rather huddled up in the &s;ame Re&s;olution, that any attempt at an index would but have increa&s;ed the confu|&s;ion.
<PB N="58" REF="65">Our A&s;&s;emblies, however, &s;oon became &s;o expert in the bu&s;ine&s;s of voting and legi&s;lation, that they de|creed away the life, liberty, and pro|perty of their fellow-&s;ubjects with more expedition than a Committee of the ENGLISH or IRISH Hou&s;e of Commons would have ventured in pa&s;&s;ing half a dozen clau&s;es in a Turn|pike Bill. If tardy ju&s;tice is an evil, tardy inju&s;tice is a greater; and if our people had rea&s;on to complain, it was not for want of celerity at lea&s;t in their &s;ufferings. A man left his hou&s;e, thinking it his own, in the morning; he returned at noon, and found it confi&s;cated. The &s;ame might be &s;aid of his head; he thought it properly placed on his &s;houlders, the
<PB N="59" REF="66">Nation thought it would look better on a pike, and it was decreed im|mediately. He knew every thing in FRANCE belonged to the Nation, and his head being national property, and removable at plea&s;ure, he had no right to murmur.</P>
<P>THUS began our Revolution; <HI>et mobilitate vigens,</HI> which may pro|perly be con&s;trued, <Q>flouri&s;hing by the Mob,</Q><HI>et vires acquirens eundo,</HI> every day exhibiting &s;ome new pro|digy, &s;tands now unparalleled in the Hi&s;tory of the Univer&s;e. Who can pronounce deci&s;ively, that we have yet a&s;cended to our ultimate point of perfection? A Reformer greater than MARAT may &s;till be re&s;erved
<PB N="60" REF="67">for our po&s;terity. We know what we have; perhaps we may yet have more. We have wars abroad, and in&s;urrections at home; we have the certainty of blood&s;hed, and the proba|bility of famine; we have Clubs in every quarter, Decrees innumerable with Murmurs and Applau&s;es, and a very fine Con&s;titution upon paper. We have the good wi&s;hes of Colonel TANDY and the UNITED IRISHMEN, with &s;ix &s;mall pieces of cannon and a hundred pair of &s;hoes from a FRIENDLY SOCIETY in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>BUT into the account mu&s;t al&s;o be taken our negatives. We have no KING, having murdered him to &s;ave charges; but we have a <HI>Democracy</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="68">forty-fold more expen&s;ive, and in the &s;ame proportion more re&s;pectable. We have no <HI>Lettres de Cachet</HI>; no <HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> with &s;ix pri&s;oners, one of whom never knew why he was com|mitted; but more awfully, we have five hundred pri&s;ons full of <HI>free Citi|zens,</HI> who not only know why they are in captivity, but al&s;o know, with|out the torture of uncertainty, that they will be ma&s;&s;acred before they get out of it.</P>
<P>WE have no impo&s;ts by the old names of <HI>Gabelle, Taille,</HI> or <HI>Corv&eacute;</HI>; but we have ampler public revenues from Loans, Benevolences, and Free Gifts, enforced by the Pike, the Poniard, and the Lamp-iron. We have no re&s;traints
<PB N="62" REF="69">from Law or from Religion; we have no God, nor no Gentleman. We are without money or breeches; and where is the u&s;e of the latter, having nothing to put into them? Shortly, perhaps, we &s;hall be exempt from the incumbrance of Colonies and Manufactures. To conclude all: We have Liberty, &s;uch as the world never before &s;aw or heard of; and a Republic, which being above the comprehen&s;ion of human nature, &s;ets all human nature nobly at defiance.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON my arrival at PARIS I found my reception with the DUKE OF ORLEANS very different from what I had experienced in LONDON. He rubbed his hands together with plea|&s;ure at &s;eeing me, clapped me on the
<PB N="64" REF="71">&s;houlder, and called me his WELL|BELOVED. "The time," &s;ays he, <Q>is come; <HI>majus opus moveo:</HI> Let our enemies look to it. Ha, ha, LOUIS CAPET! Ha, ha, MARIE ANTOI|NETTE! Remember TRIANON.&mdash;A &s;tout heart and a &s;harp dagger &s;hall &s;hew them I have not forgot their kindne&s;s.</Q> Thus went he on. In &s;hoit, nothing was too good for me&mdash;I was his deare&s;t friend, nor would he hear of my lodging any|where but in the Palace. This al|teration I was not weak enough to a&s;cribe to any revival of his former partiality for me, but to his knowing that he could now employ me more effectually for his &s;ervice. He was cold to me in LONDON becau&s;e then
<PB N="65" REF="72">he did not want my abilities, and he care&s;&s;ed me at PARIS becau&s;e there he could make u&s;e of them: &s;o much does the con&s;equence of individuals depend upon place and &s;ea&s;on. I pretended to be the dupe of his in&s;in|cerity, knowing that a wi&s;e man who wi&s;hes to make his fortune, &s;hould always, like the Cameleon, a&s;&s;ume the colour of the object next to him.</P>
<P>THE manner in which the Ba&s;tile was taken is &s;o well and &s;o univer|&s;ally known, that it would be unne|ce&s;&s;ary and impertinent to wa&s;te any of my paper in the recital. It was the great event which confirmed the tri|umph of the Populace at the time, and
<PB N="66" REF="73">its con&s;equences, by our able manage|ment, has entailed upon them more mi&s;eries than they, or any people in EUROPE ever groaned under. This un|expected conque&s;t was attended with advantages much more important to us than the mere demolition of a fortre&s;s, which, properly de&s;ended, might have baffled all our ho&s;tilities, for it &s;erved to &s;helter every enormity which we committed for many months a&s;terwards. When we were accu&s;ed of inju&s;tice, pillage, or ma&s;|&s;acre, we pointed to the ruins of that pri&s;on, though we might as well have referred the &s;u&s;ferers, for their con&s;olation, to the burning of TROY or of CARTHAGE. When a mother complained of the wanton murder of
<PB N="67" REF="74">her child, or a child lamented the &s;laughter of its parent, we bade them dry up their tears, and think of the Ba&s;tile in&s;tead of it. Did the poor cry for the bread we had torn from their hunger, we literally fulfilled the Scripture, and gave them a &s;tone of the Ba&s;tile to appea&s;e it. This was the balm for every wound, the panacea for every malady. It &s;erved as a kind of cro&s;s-purpo&s;es to the under&s;tanding. Like the <Q><HI>&s;ans Dot</HI></Q> of HARPAGON, it &s;topped the mouth of all cavillers, and &s;upplied the place of honour, wi&s;dom, and probity. It was our unan&s;werable an&s;wer to every objection, the uni|ver&s;al &s;punge which &s;oaked up every iniquity.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">WE were indeed much di&s;ap|pointed to find, when its unhallowed jaws were forced open, that it con|tained but &s;ix pri&s;oners. We hoped to have found thou&s;ands. It &s;hewed at lea&s;t the lenity and moderation of the then exi&s;ting Government. The mo&s;t violent enemies, however, of our Reformation were too wi&s;e to dwell much upon this as an argu|ment again&s;t us. A pri&s;on is not in|compatible with the general freedom of mankind, in &s;ome ca&s;es it, con&s;ti|tutes their &s;ecurity; but a pri&s;on where men might be con&s;ined inno|cent of any crime again&s;t Society or the State and who had no means of e&s;caping from it but the permi&s;&s;ion of the tyrants who en&s;laved them,
<PB N="69" REF="76">can admit of no palliation from elo|quence or ingenuity. Abu&s;e long &s;anctioned by pre&s;cription, and long, tho' indignantly, acquie&s;ced under, may be relaxed at particular &s;ea&s;ons: yet that makes little difference; its exi&s;tence, the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uffering by it, is the grievance. It is &s;uch, let AUGUSTUS or TIBERIUS, TITUS or DOMITIAN, be the Rulers. Its iron hinges may ru&s;t under a mild Prince, they will &s;oon be oiled again under a Tyrant. It is the real Sword of DAMOCLES, &s;u&s;pended by a hair over the head of the &s;ubject. He mu&s;t have indeed a keen appetite and a &s;trong dige&s;tion who can glance his eye towards the point, and
<PB N="70" REF="77">reli&s;h under &s;uch circum&s;tances the mo&s;t delicious banquet.</P>
<P>IT is well known how we cut off DE LAUNAY the Governor's head without any trial, and piked it. BERTHIER and FOULON we &s;erved in the &s;ame manner. The ceremony of parading the heads was done by &s;ugge&s;tion from the DUKE OF ORLEANS. Be&s;ides the beauty of the &s;pectacle, it was the opinion of His Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s, that the familiarizing the people to &s;uch &s;ights mu&s;t make them much more ferocious and cruel, and fitter of cour&s;e for our purpo&s;es. SYLLA, at ROME, he &s;aid, had derived num|berle&s;s
<PB N="71" REF="78">advantages from a &s;imilar practice.</P>
<P>MARAT and I were the Foll|bearers, and infinite were the plea|&s;antries which pa&s;&s;ed between us, while we &s;taggered along under our gha&s;tly burdens. I never knew the rogue &s;o witty. Borrowing a hint from the &s;tory of JACK CADE (a Reformer of ENGLAND in the Reign of the Sixth HENRY), we brought the heads to|gether at the corners of the &s;treets, that they might &s;eem to have a little conference, then chucked the faces again&s;t each other by way of a fare|well ki&s;s, and taking leave politely on their &s;eparation. This little play
<PB N="72" REF="79">with the heads always made the Duke laugh prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I SHALL pa&s;s over without parti|cular notice the various tumults at VERSAILLES in October 1789, the Gardes de Corps firing upon the Mob who attacked the Palace, the Regi|ment de Flandre clubbing their arms, and the Swi&s;s doing nothing for want of orders. But as about this time the honour of my family was more immediately concerned, I cannot for|bear to mention, that my Mother put her&s;elf at the head of about five thou&s;and of her own &s;ex, and chiefly of her own re&s;pectable calling, Fi&s;h|women, and marchedto VERSAILLES, in order to &s;ettle matters as &s;he and
<PB N="73" REF="80">her corps of Nereids &s;hould find be&s;t for the public welfare, No &s;pectacle could be more &s;ublime and awful. The altitude of her &s;tature, the huge length of her &s;trides, the brandi&s;h|ing of her bloody knife in her left hand, her pole, with a &s;pike at the end of it, in her right, the ferocity of her countenance, the &s;hrillne&s;s of her cries, the clattering of her wooden &s;hoes in the kennel, the &s;cales and entrails of fi&s;h which co|vered her tattered garments, three or four eels alive twining about her, and the odour i&s;&s;uing from the whole, formed &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of the di&s;gu&s;ting and terrible, as no human fortitude could behold and inhale without &s;hrinking.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="81">Terribilis Stygio facies pallore gravatur, Impexis onerata comis.</P>
<P>She might have &s;at to FUSELI for the Picture of ERICTHO or MEGARA.</P>
<P>On the evening of the &s;ame day, LA FAYETTE, who perhaps might have thought that my mother's way of &s;ettling the State would not ex|actly an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, marched off for VERSAILLES at the head of twenty thou&s;and of the Paris Militia, and brought up the Royal Family pri|&s;oners to the metropolis.</P>
<P>MAMMA, who was a little fatigued by her expedition, fir&s;t mounted on the roof of the King's coach, at|tended by three Ladies, her Aids-de|Camp;
<PB N="75" REF="82">and as her long legs hung down over the window, &s;he had the honour of be&s;pattering his Maje&s;ty's vi&s;age with the mire of her &s;abots during the whole pa&s;&s;age, which la&s;t|ed at lea&s;t for &s;ix hours. The vehicle, with the King cooped up a pri&s;oner within, and Mamma with her atten|dants howling and ge&s;ticulating over him, exhibited a very exact emblem of our Governmen.</P>
<P>A KING le&s;s humane than LOUIS would certainly never have &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;ubject to &s;uch cruel in&s;ults, but nothing could induce him to countenance the &s;laughter of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="83">Two or three attempts, as is well known, conducted by the DUKE OF ORLEANS, were near being &s;ucce&s;s|ful to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him and the Queen, during their impri&s;onment in the Thuilleries. It was not at this time called their impri&s;onment, tho' in fact it was &s;o, for they were con|&s;tantly watched by our Spies, and attended by Guards we had placed over them, but all was under the pretext of &s;ecuring them from the rabble. LA FAYETTE, a weak man, infected with &s;ome dregs of huma|nity, never intended them any per|&s;onal injury; but unable to controul the &s;torm which he contributed to rai&s;e, he has &s;uffered for his, half-trea&s;on the fate which commonly at|tends
<PB N="77" REF="84">upon all Half-traitors: he has no friends on any &s;ide. We &s;hould have cut off his head, and our enemies have ca&s;t him into a dun|geon. It requires great vices, or very &s;uperior qualifications, to be a &s;ucce&s;sful Con&s;pirator.</P>
<P>WE kept, in &s;hort, this ill-matched, this ill-fated Royal Pair in &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;tate of &s;ubjection and terror, that at la&s;t they attempted to e&s;cape, but, by a few perver&s;e accidents, fell back again into our hands to &s;uffer all the ingenious cruelty of inexo|rable Republicani&s;m. Then fol|lowed their depo&s;ition, and impri&s;on|ment in the Temple, the King's mock trial, and his murder.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">PREVIOUS to this &s;olemn mummery, MARAT, ROBESPIERRE and my&s;elf, by the DUKE'S intere&s;t, were elected Members of the National Conven|tion His Highne&s;stold us we were at liberty to turn this new dignity to our own advantage, that is, to get what money we could for our voices, he having but one condition to make with us, that we &s;hould vote to find the King guilty. As we hear|tily wi&s;hed for his Maje&s;ty's con|demnation, we made no &s;cruple to enter into this engagement. Plunder, and to &s;helter our&s;elves from any after-account for it, were our prin|cipal objects.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="86">So great an event as the King's death upon a &s;eaffold, we knew, would throw things, if po&s;&s;ible, into a &s;tate of more inexplicable confu&s;ion, and con&s;equently give us more &s;ecurity; for in complete anarchy, who need fear retribution, and the feeble voice of Ju&s;tice? Our venality was &s;o notorious, that tho&s;e who had bu&s;ine&s;s depending before the Con|vention did not, as &s;ometimes hap|pens, pretend to colour over or di&s;|gui&s;e their motives for offering us money, by &s;aying, perhaps we might want it, and they had plenty, or &s;uch half-faced ba&s;hful pretences; but like people of plain &s;en&s;e and fair deal|ing, they came to the point at once, and a&s;ked our lowe&s;t price for each
<PB N="80" REF="87">&s;pecific act of inju&s;tice. We had a certain &s;um for keeping away from the A&s;&s;embly entirely, a certain &s;um for rai&s;ing a riot to interrupt the pro|ceedings, &s;till more for voting di|rectly again&s;t the evidence; in &s;hort, we were well paid for every thing we could do for the advantage of our clients. We very much re&s;embled tho&s;e great men who were called the Patrons of the Poor in the Roman Senate.</P>
<P>NOR did its being divulged that we had taken money on one &s;ide pre|vent applications to us from the other. Our flexibility was no &s;ecret; the notoriety of our being retained by one party was even of con&s;iderable
<PB N="81" REF="88">&s;ervice to us, as it greatly increa&s;ed our demand for the counter-bribe, which every candid per&s;on mu&s;t al|low to have been perfectly rea&s;onable. From this &s;ort of fair traffic we derived very con&s;iderable profit. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed that this practice was confined to the Triumvirate. Far from it, above half the Convention &s;hewed the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e that we did. In the bu&s;ine&s;s of the King's trial I was bribed nine times back and forward, but nothing could get the better of my honour; my word to the DUKE was pledged, and I kept it &s;acred. From the conver&s;ation of all tho&s;e about me, I found mo&s;t of my Brother-Members had made a very good day's work of it. We ex|pected
<PB N="82" REF="89">at lea&s;t as much when it came to the Queen's turn to appear before us, one rea&s;on which always made MARAT in particular &s;o violent for bringing her Maje&s;ty to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE Tenth of Augu&s;t 1792, that glorious day, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed only by the Second of September following, would require an abler pen than mine to do ju&s;tice to its immortal horrors.</P>
<P>OUR Emi&s;&s;aries, with their u&s;ual indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, had &s;et the common people in a ferment by ru|mours that the ari&s;tocratical party at Paris, not yet cru&s;hed by all our per&s;ecution, but acting in concert
<PB N="83" REF="90">with the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian In|vaders, had formed a con&s;piracy to deliver the Royal Family from capti|vity, and to ma&s;&s;acre, without di&s;|tinction, all the harmle&s;s, un&s;u&s;pect|ing inhabitants. This was more than &s;ufficient. Dry &s;traw, flax, or thread, are not more ea&s;ily kindled into a flame than the Mob of Paris, and e&s;pecially &s;ince they have been taught that to be in a con&s;tant &s;tate of in&s;ur|rection is one unque&s;tionable right of the people.</P>
<P>THEY a&s;&s;embled early. The <HI>Quays,</HI> the <HI>Fauxbourgs,</HI> and the <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> vomited out their de&s;perate thou|&s;ands; every garret, every cellar was emptied of its ragged Reformers.
<PB N="84" REF="91">In numbers without number they rolled on to the Thuilleries, determined to &s;eize the KING and QUEEN, and immolate them to their blind fury. Their Maje&s;ties fled for &s;afety to the Convention, who &s;natched them from the pre&s;ent danger, chu&s;ing to re&s;erve for them&s;elves the ceremony of their future murder. While their ammunition la&s;ted, the Swi&s;s who were upon duty kept up an ince&s;&s;ant fire, and did great execution; but that being expended, the multitude broke in upon them, and ma&s;&s;acred them all to a man with the mo&s;t unrelent|ing ferocity. Then followed &s;uch a glorious &s;cene as the Gods of HOMER might have looked down upon with complacency. I will not attempt to
<PB N="85" REF="92">repre&s;ent it, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary. The great Hi&s;torian TACITUS, when he de&s;cribed the &s;tate of ROME after the death of VITELLIUS, drew the picture of PARIS on the tenth of Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>THE latter part of the foregoing quotation, I am &s;en&s;ible, does not &s;eem favourable to the principles of our party, but to prove the impar|tiality of my &s;pirit, I would not &s;up|pre&s;s it; be&s;ides, no great weight &s;hould be allowed to the &s;entiments of a ROMAN, however illu&s;trious, who wrote after his country cea&s;ed to be Republican.

<P><PB N="87" REF="94">AFTER having recorded &s;o many actions of my own and of others in the cour&s;e of this faithful narration, filial piety will not &s;uffer me to pa&s;s over on that memorable day the atchieve|ments of the dear Woman who bore me nine moons in her maternal flank, who fed my infant hunger with &s;tale fi&s;h, and moi&s;tened my young lip with brandy.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE ma&s;&s;acre of the Hugonots in FRANCE on the fe&s;tival of Saint BARTHOLOMEW &s;tood for more than two centuries unrivalled. Many have doubted whether it &s;hould not yield the preference to the Tenth of Augu&s;t 1792. My opinion is clearly in favour of the latter. It was little le&s;s bloody, more deci&s;ive, and look|ing to its con&s;equences, more im|portant
<PB N="92" REF="99">and extraordinary. The fir&s;t but dimini&s;hed a Sect, the la&s;t over|turned a Monarchy. The Sect &s;oon recovered, but the Kingly Crown lies for ever pro&s;trate. Let but the holy flame of Enthu&s;ia&s;m act upon the major part of a nation as a great prin|ciple of union, it will naturally fire men to the mo&s;t extravagant, the wilde&s;t exce&s;&s;es. Tempers the mo&s;t mild, di&s;po&s;itions the mo&s;t benevo|lent have been totally perverted by it. It has often metamorpho&s;ed the lamb into the tyger. But there was no Religion, no pretence of Religion on the Tenth of Augu&s;t to combine our efforts, and to precipitate our fury. It was pure, unmixed democratic rage, and virtuous cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="100">LEAVING then the advocates for each of the&s;e great days to decide the palm as they plea&s;e, the Second of September claims over them both an indi&s;putable &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>EVERY pri&s;on in PARIS was crowded with wretches who had e&s;caped the &s;aughter of Augu&s;t; well would it have been for them, that they had then peri&s;hed. Mo&s;t of them were Prie&s;ts, feeble old men, women or children, and as ignorant of the cau&s;e of their commitment as we were indifferent about it. We re|&s;olved to have a general gaol deli|very, and our manner of performing this ceremony was perhaps the mo&s;t &s;ingular of any upon record in the
<PB N="94" REF="101">annals of juri&s;prudence. The Nephew of DAMIEN, MARAT, and I, took upon our&s;elves the conduct of this bu&s;ine&s;s. Our fir&s;t care was to hire about a hundred Executioners; the&s;e were called the <HI>Tueurs,</HI> or <HI>Killers,</HI> and being men of good prin|ciples, friends to their Country, and fond of the People's Government, they agreed for the rea&s;onable gra|tuity of &s;ix livres per day each, to deliver all the gaols, by putting every pri&s;oner in them to death.</P>
<P>THE &s;trict attention to the oeco|nomical management of the public money, which we manife&s;ted in our &s;tipulation with the <HI>Killers,</HI> well de|&s;erved the honourable mention made
<PB N="95" REF="102">of it in the Convention a&s;terwards; for we not only reduced the demand of the&s;e Gentlemen from a Louis d'Or to &s;ix Livres, by a&s;&s;uring them, that if they did not agree to the abatement, we would get it done for nothing; but the whole expence was de&s;rayed out of the pockets of the condemned, &s;o the pri&s;oners paid for their own execution.</P>
<P>IT is probable that every Mini&s;ter at the head of the finances of his country may adopt this mode of &s;av|ing the public trea&s;ure; and among the re&s;t, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that Mr. PITT of ENGLAND (that hereditary &s;courge of our nation, and who&s;e name my a&s;&s;ociates never
<PB N="96" REF="103">mention without abhorrence) may al&s;o conde&s;cend to borrow the prac|tice from us, though, perhaps, he will not have candour enough to ac|knowledge from whence the hint was taken.</P>
<P>IN every room of every pri&s;on was erected a little tribunal. A Judge &s;at with a red night-cap, the emblem of &s;peedy Ju&s;tice and Liberty, on his head, without breeches, his legs and arms bare, and a bloody &s;word lying drawn before him. A paper, con|taining the names of the Criminals, was pre&s;ented to him. When the Judge could not read, as was com|monly the ca&s;e, the names were told to him by one of the Pike-men, his
<PB N="97" REF="104">Guards, who &s;tood on each &s;ide of him. The&s;e Guards had al&s;o their legs and arms bare, and were with|out breeches, and it greatly encrea&s;ed the dignity and awfulne&s;s of the &s;pectacle. Nothing &s;erves to make Ju&s;tice &s;o re&s;pectable as when its ap|pearance &s;trikes a Pri&s;oner immedi|ately with the conviction that his condemnation is certain, and that his execution will be in&s;tantaneous. A man of &s;en&s;e makes up his mind at once to his condition, and is relieved in a moment from the torture of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that mo&s;t unea&s;y of all hu|man &s;en&s;ations. When a name was called, two of the <HI>Killers</HI> immediately &s;eized upon the Pri&s;oner next to them, and holding their drawn
<PB N="98" REF="105">&s;words to his throat, dragged him before the Tribunal. His pockets were rifled, and their contents deli|vered to the Judge, who &s;ometimes, after a&s;king a que&s;tion or two, but never paying any attention to the an|&s;wers, gave a nod to the <HI>Killers,</HI> and they di&s;patched him immediately. The body was then dragged out of the room, and thrown into the &s;treet, or into the yard of the pri&s;on. Many were condemned for their ari&s;tocra|tical names, and many for the in|civi&s;m of their faces. Sometimes the Judge would &s;ay, <Q>I find this man guilty,</Q> when a woman or a child happened to be before him; but many more had the &s;atisfaction of &s;uffering under names which did
<PB N="99" REF="106">not belong to them; &s;o there might have been a revi&s;ion of the &s;entence, had the &s;urvivors of the family thought proper to &s;ue for it, as it might ea&s;ily have been proved there had been an error in the proceedings. As to the real &s;ub&s;tance of the matter, this la&s;t circum&s;tance made no great difference; for as we had re&s;olved to de&s;troy them all, the little mi&s;take of a name was of no material con&s;equence.</P>
<P>SUMMARY as was the manner in which our DANIELS admini&s;tered u&s;tice (for no trial la&s;ted above two minutes) MARAT, that friend to hu|manity, and I devi&s;ed a method &s;till more expeditious. We ordered the culprits to be dragged down by
<PB N="100" REF="107">dozens into the yard, and there to be run through with pikes, or hewn down with &s;abres, and &s;o to di&s;pen&s;e with the unnece&s;&s;ary delay from any further formality. We had at lea&s;t five thou&s;and &s;ouls to di&s;po&s;e of, and every one mu&s;t &s;ee that no time ought to have been wa&s;ted on trifles. Time is one of the modes of exi&s;t|ence mo&s;t precious to tho&s;e who know how to make a good u&s;e of it; but &s;hort and tran&s;ient as it is, the idler is for ever complaining that it hangs like a dead weight upon him, whereas he ought to blame the va|cuity of his own mind, and his mo|notonous indolence.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="108">As we began by delivering the gaols fir&s;t in the lower apartments, I can well conceive that the victims in tho&s;e above, who could &s;ee between the bars of the windows what was doing in the yard beneath them, mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed the interval, till it came to their turn, rather unplea|&s;antly. One Citizen indeed, almo&s;t the only one who e&s;caped, and almo&s;t as by a miracle, has given a &s;hort ac|count, though &s;atisfactory enough, of the effect of the&s;e executions upon the then &s;urviving &s;pectators. He &s;ays (I think), that concluding their death to be inevitable, they tried to ob&s;erve what manner of receiving it was attended with the lea&s;t pain, and the greate&s;t celerity; and that tho&s;e who
<PB N="102" REF="109">&s;ubmitted at once, without attempt|ing any degree of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;eemed to expire with perceptibly the &s;malle&s;t &s;en&s;e of angui&s;h. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tran&s;lation of the <Q>Thirty-eight Hours Agony of M.

<P>I BELIEVE he is right; and I re|commend to my readers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of my own dear country, not to think the ob&s;ervation unworthy of their &s;erious notice; for in a free Government like ours, where Li|berty is &s;o well under&s;tood, that no man can calculate upon his exi&s;tence for &s;ix hours, it is clearly a matter of &s;ome moment to a&s;certain the manner
<PB N="103" REF="110">in which he can be deprived of it with the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>To the immortal honour of the CONVENTION, let it not be forgotten, that tho' they were perfectly well ac|quainted with all that was tran&s;act|ing in the pri&s;ons, &s;uch was their deference for the &s;pirit of a free people, that they took not a &s;ingle &s;tep to &s;ave the captives, or to impede the cour&s;e of that ju&s;tice which was thus flowing in &s;o many crim&s;on &s;treams through different quarters of the metropolis. It was a proud day, a glorious day, <HI>quibus laudibus effe|remus?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="111">ONE ob&s;ervation mu&s;t, I think; in this place, &s;trike even a &s;uper&s;icial reader, that we are the mo&s;t philo&s;o|phical people, and mo&s;t exempt from the weakne&s;s of humanity, of any in the univer&s;e, con&s;equently the mo&s;t formidable. Look for any &s;oaring example of ambition in modern times, Where is it to be found? In FRANCE. Look for one of public faith nobly di&s;dained, or ingeniou&s;ly eluded, FRANCE can furni&s;h it. Look for animated profligacy, luxurious re|finement in debauch, for unadulte|rated impiety and athei&s;m, What na|tion can compare with us? Our in|tolerance, our ma&s;&s;acres in cold blood are unparalleled. We taught the world the mo&s;t amiable depravity,
<PB N="105" REF="112">the mo&s;t polite corruption of manners, while we were &s;laves; let it learn from us more awful le&s;&s;ons, now we are become Tyrants. While we were but libertines and coxcombs, the na|tions around admired, and tried to imitate us; it would become them to reverence us, and to &s;ubmit, now we are exalted into Regicides and Re|formers. Have we not above twenty millions of people? a delicious cli|mate? the purple grape? the par|tridge-eyed wine and the white of lou&s;y Champagne in abundance? a &s;oil exuberant in its produce, ingenious arti&s;ts, light-heeled dancers, magni|ficent theatres, e&s;tabli&s;hed manufac|tures, flouri&s;hing colonies, &s;hips, docks, ar&s;enals, canals, and navigable
<PB N="105" REF="113">rivers? Have we every ble&s;ting, every advantage that Nature and Art can be&s;tow upon rea&s;onable creatures, and &s;hall we &s;it down tamely con|tented? Shall we not &s;hew our &s;upe|riority? Shall not others be the wor&s;e for all this? Shall we not invade? Shall we not de&s;olate? Shall we not plant the Tree of Liberty? Shall we not fraternize? Shall we not reform? Shall we not pull down Kings, and elevate the Red Night-Cap? ENG|LAND, SPAIN, AUSTRIA, PRUSSIA, RUSSIA, and SAVOY may &s;ay, "NO." We care not: Let them but follow our example, or adopt our maxims, they will have the wor&s;t of the con|te&s;t. Being a FRENCHMAN, I may be partial, yet I think we have a fair

<P>UNLESS the Reader will take warmly with me a retro&s;pective view to the Second of September, he cannot &s;hare my glowing &s;en&s;ibility at the recollection. "How is it," as ROUSSEAU &s;ays of Love, <Q>that being &s;o penetrated with the &s;en&s;e, I fail &s;o in the de&s;cription?</Q> Let it be con&s;idered, when the butchery began, the heat and flame of action was over, that it la&s;ted the whole day without intermi&s;&s;ion, that the Judges and Executioners knew the &s;ufferers were all as innocent as lambs un&s;horn, and that it made no moreimpre&s;&s;ion on
<PB N="108" REF="115">them than if their hearts had been compo&s;ed of the &s;ame metal as their &s;word-blades. Here was firmne&s;s; here was Roman Fortitude. So &s;hould the benches of Democratic Ju&s;tice be always filled! No voice faultered, no cheek lo&s;t its colour. Unmoved they &s;aw their &s;treaming eyes, their piteous looks, their &s;up|plicating ge&s;tures. They were thanked by their Country for their &s;ervices, but they found their be&s;t re|tribution in their own reflections, and in the con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of having faithfully di&s;charged their duty to the Republic.</P>
<P>ON this great day fell the DUCHESS OF LAMBALLE, and the proude&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="116">Ari&s;tocratical Spirit in FRANCE fell with her. Her high birth, her lofty notions, her di&s;dain of the Mob, and her attachment to the Royal Family, had long marked her as a proper &s;acrifice for the Altar of Liberty. But &s;he had a crime of a deeper die, She was intitled to twelve thou&s;and pounds a-year from the DUKE OF ORLEANS. <HI>Hinc illi prima mali labes.</HI> When we had the honour of confining the Royal Family in the <HI>Temple,</HI> we thru&s;t Madame LAMBALLE into a pri&s;onal&s;o. While ju&s;tice was admini&s;tering, as I have before related, &s;ome weak friend of this Lady, who wi&s;hed to &s;ave her, flew to the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> his face pale, and his hair &s;tanding erect
<PB N="110" REF="117">with horror, to appri&s;e the DUKE OF ORLEANS of her danger. Good &s;oul! he had forgot that His High|ne&s;s paid her twelve thou&s;and a-year, and only remembered the nearne&s;s of their alliance. Not ten minutes before, I had &s;lipped home (knowing what was to happen) to congratulate my Patron on the di&s;continuance of his future payments to the Duche&s;s.</P>
<P>To &s;peak but truth, the DUKE never di&s;played more good &s;en&s;e, more politene&s;s, and more compo&s;ure. He received the &s;tranger with his u&s;ual good-breeding, and an air of uncom|mon fe&s;tivity. "Pray, Sir," &s;ays the merry Duke, <Q>&s;uffer me to put &s;ome wine in your gla&s;s, you &s;eem di&s;|compo&s;ed! If I do not mi&s;take,
<PB N="111" REF="118">you, mentioned Madame LAM|BALLE; a fine woman, young gentleman!&mdash;Abumper, COUTEAU! <HI>(looking at me archly)</HI> This is Ma|dame LAMBALLE'S health! You are a happy fellow! you have been in her good graces, I doubt not.</Q> The&s;e little plea&s;antries were not at all in uni&s;on with the mood of the &s;tranger; but aba&s;hed, a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;hocked, he ran &s;obbing out of the room, his eyes and hands li&s;ted up to Heaven, as if he expected the roof would fall to cru&s;h our unhallowed Sympo&s;ium.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;ome circum&s;tances attending the execution of this fair
<PB N="112" REF="119">Duche&s;s &s;ingular and entertaining enough.</P>
<P>THE door of her pri&s;on-chamber happened to be open, and &s;he walked out into the &s;treet. There was &s;uch an air of impo&s;ing dignity, &s;uch a look of natural &s;uperiority in her ap|pearance, that our Friends of the Kennel &s;lunk back, and involuntarily &s;eemed to make way for her. She pa&s;&s;ed on unmole&s;ted for &s;ome little way, when fortunately a quick-eyed friend of the DUKE'S e&s;pied her. He hold up a piece of money in one hand, and pointing to the Duche&s;s with the other, a patriotic Coal|porter, armed with a bar of iron, no &s;ooner &s;aw the money, than he, ru&s;hed

<PB N="113" REF="121">forward, and &s;eizing her by the lux|uriant hair, as a &s;tag is &s;ometimes caught by the branches, &s;truck her gallantly on the head till &s;he reeled and tumbled. A <HI>Killer,</HI> properly in|&s;tructed, then advanced, and ca&s;ting her neck over one of his knees, hackled off her head, certainly in a very bungling manner. The poor fellow, however, as I knew after|wards, was not in the lea&s;t to blame; his weapon was blunt from the quantity of ju&s;tice-work he had di&s;patched in the pri&s;on, and hone&s;t &s;weat poured from his brows before half his ta&s;k was over.</P>
<P>SEVERAL in&s;inuations at the time were thrown out again&s;t the fair fame of this <HI>Killer,</HI> as if he had been under a trepidation, or unwil|ling
<PB N="114" REF="122">to do his duty, but it was the lie of the day, and perfectly unfounded. Had I a friend or an enemy to &s;lay, I know no one to whom I would &s;ooner tru&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s. We &s;ometimes &s;port too lightly with reputation. From the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the operation the Duche&s;s &s;uffered little, for from the moment &s;he received the blow from the Coal-porter's iron &s;he was in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility: there was no per&s;onal malice intended by the executioner; had &s;he been his &s;i&s;ter or his mother, the thing would have been done ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>THIS Lady being a character con|&s;picuou&s;ly obnoxious, it was re&s;olved to make her con&s;picuou&s;ly an ex|ample.
<PB N="115" REF="123">Her head being off, her en|trails were next taken out, and put carefully into a large ve&s;&s;el of wood with a flat bottom. Her head was &s;ent to one of her hair-dre&s;&s;ers, with orders to have her cheeks well rouged, and her fine hair dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t be|coming manner; for as we intended &s;he &s;hould pay &s;ome vi&s;its, it would have been unpardonable to have &s;uf|fered her appearance to be entirely neglected.</P>
<P>THE High-Prie&s;t of the Toilette, a mere milk-&s;op, fainted at the &s;ight, and was immediately pierced with twenty Republican &s;words, as a re|ward for his de&s;picable pu&s;illanimity and incivi&s;m. By another arti&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="124">of more firmne&s;s and better prin|ciples the dre&s;&s;ing was done very neatly. The head and bowels were then placed upon a board, and pa|raded round the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> but fir&s;t under the DUKE'S windows. His Highne&s;s ro&s;e from table with a napkin in his hand, and looking out &s;aid no more than, <Q>Aye, I &s;ee it is the Duche&s;s, I know her by the hair; &s;he is come to take leave, but, thank my &s;tars! not to call for her jointure.</Q> What a pity that a per&s;on who can &s;hew &s;uch a great mind at times, and be &s;o plea&s;ant as the DUKE, &s;hould be &s;ubject to any capital weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="125">AFTER the head and vi&s;cera had paid their compliments at the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> their next vi&s;it was to the <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>OUR friends, who went before, rent the air with the joyful &s;houts of "Liberty" to bring the Royal Pri&s;oners to the window, and they &s;ucceeded. The remains of the Duche&s;s were then held up, &s;o as to be vi&s;ible from that where the Queen &s;tood. We could ob&s;erve &s;he turned deadly pale at the fight; and we heard after|wards from our Guards, who were in the chamber, that &s;he &s;hrieked out, "Mon&s;ters! Ah poor LAMBALLE!" and fell in a deep &s;woon into the King's arms.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="128">THROUGH the &s;ame channel of in|telligence we had al&s;o the plea&s;ure to learn that her wonted fortitude ap|peared to have for&s;aken her from that hour, a di&s;mal melancholy took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and there was rea&s;on to hope it would end in the entire lo&s;s of her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>WHILE the head and bowels were paying their compliments as I have related, the re&s;t of MADAME's ana|tomy was diverting our good friends in other parts of the City. Four gallant Demagogues, one &s;tationed at each leg and arm, dragged the beau|tiful body thro' mo&s;t of the kennels of Paris. When the parade was over it was tumbled among the other car|ca&s;es,
<PB N="119" REF="127">all forming together a very noble pile of carnage. Upon the whole, I prefer this act of ju&s;tice, with all its concomitant circum|&s;tances, to the mangling of the Ad|miral COLIGNI, &s;o minutely de|&s;cribed by DAVILA and other Hi&s;to|rians. We have not degenerated from our Ance&s;tors: if I am not too partial to my Contemporaries, I pre|&s;ume to flatter my&s;elf, that we have &s;oared above them.</P>
<P>IN the morning of this glorious day we had &s;et up a Tree of Liberty properly decorated in the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> and we concluded the night with a concert, a little dance, and a bonfire, the DUKE doing our family
<PB N="120" REF="128">the honour to take out my Mother as his fir&s;t partner.</P>
<P>THE Tree of Liberty is not origi|nally of FRENCH in&s;titution. We tran&s;planted it &s;ince la&s;t war from AMERICA; and as the &s;olemnity at home is exactly the &s;ame as in that country, and &s;o generally known, there is no nece&s;&s;ity to particularize it here. The improvements in coun|tries we have fraternized de&s;erve to be mentioned. Our Soldiers without breeches, and in red night-caps, form a ring round the Tree. Should there happen to be the lea&s;t deficiency in the contributions we have ordered to be levied upon our brethren, we &s;eize half-a-dozen of the Magi&s;trates, or
<PB N="121" REF="129">principal inhabitants, load them with irons, ca&s;t them into a dungeon, and prohibit any intercour&s;e between them and their families. After a little time they are drawn out of pri&s;on, and fa&s;tened by their chains to the Tree of Liberty. Every now and then our Guards give them a &s;lice with their &s;abres, a &s;tab with the pike, or roa&s;t them a little at a &s;low fire, all the time our fifers and hautboys playing "<HI>Ca Ira,</HI>" or &s;ome other animating harmony; and no &s;cene can be imagined more lively. In the end we all get drunk, and leave our brethren tied to the Tree, either to die of their wounds, or to expire with, hunger.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="130">THESE ceremonies have a wonder|ful effect on the nerves of the Spec|tators, and on all Friends of Liberty, according to the real &s;ignification of that emphatic term, which is &s;o often pronounced, and &s;o &s;eldom under|&s;tood by the generality of mankind.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the two preceding Chapters, which contain a &s;hort &s;ummary of events di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e two bright days the Tenth of Augu&s;t and the Second of September, it was im|po&s;&s;ible not to pre&s;ent the Public with pictures drawn only in blood: but "<HI>non omnes arbu&s;ta juvant</HI>;" however fond we may be of the good
<PB N="124" REF="132">things which furni&s;h out our tables, no one would chu&s;e to walk always in the &s;hambles, to which our in|ternal hi&s;tory for near four years bears &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>SOME perhaps may be &s;o difficult as not to reli&s;h any entertainment we can &s;et before them, yet have our Penmen variety in abundance for va|rious appetites. Who can be unin|tere&s;ted to hear of the perpetual de|feats of our armies, the &s;laughter of our bare-breeched ragged Soldiers without any vi&s;ible diminution of their numbers, the de&s;olation of our Frontier Towns, the reduction of our &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;&s;es, ho&s;tile Nations pouring in upon us from every
<PB N="125" REF="133">quarter, and all mankind &s;hrinking from our alliance, while our Demo|cratic Spirit &s;eems to ride nobly buoyant over he calamities which environ us? What can be more ex|traordinary than to &s;ee our Conven|tion decreeing away property which does not belong to their di&s;po&s;al, &s;ending about Commi&s;&s;ioners to ani|mate de&s;peration, denouncing each other as traitors at every meeting, and ca&s;hiering, di&s;gracing, impri&s;oning, or beheading in their turn every one of our Generals? The Republic of CARTHAGE, which &s;ometimes cru|cified un&s;ucce&s;sful leaders, was but our humble precur&s;or in &s;everity; for from the mongrel Royali&s;t LA FAYETTE to the carou&s;ing CUSTINE,
<PB N="126" REF="134">we have not &s;pared a man of them. We have taught them a new Tactic, to tremble at their friends, and fly for refuge to their enemies. If they con|quer, we denounce; if they are van|qui&s;hed, we behead them. What confidence can be repo&s;ed in Officers who could betray their Sovereign? They inve&s;ted us with the power to be Tyrants, and they mu&s;t expect to feel it. Thus all denominations, all orders of mankind are taught to re|&s;pect us.</P>
<P>IF matter like this, with the ince&s;|&s;ant play of our nimble Guillotine, be not &s;ufficient to intere&s;t curio&s;ity, it mu&s;t re&s;ort to fiction and fancy, for
<PB N="127" REF="135">our hi&s;tory, our facts are too tame for it.</P>
<P>THE following Anecdote, which is rather of a comic than of a &s;erious nature, does not de&s;erve attention &s;o much for its own importance, as be|cau&s;e it may &s;erve, in my hands, to &s;ettle the public belief about an affair, which, though it has been often and variou&s;ly related, has never hitherto been related truly. Almo&s;t every per&s;on had heard &s;omething, yet the information of no two was &s;o much alike, as to make in their ac|counts any tolerable agreement. It is better to be entirely ignorant of a &s;tory than to know it imperfectly. The
<PB N="128" REF="136">mind in &s;uch a &s;tate acquires nothing but mi&s;information and uncertainty.</P>
<P>IT has always been &s;uppo&s;ed in FRANCE, that the DUKE OF OR|LEANS had &s;old him&s;elf to the Devil. His way of life, and the general tenor of his conduct, made it appear pro|bable. Whatever might be the foun|dation for &s;uch a rumour, it certainly was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of His Highne&s;s to di&s;countenance it, as it greatly en|crea&s;ed the veneration for his cha|racter among his countrymen. His being &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;ides to act by the in&s;piration, and under the protection of a preternatural being, &s;eemed to imply not only wi&s;dom and &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="129" REF="137">in what he &s;hould undertake, but &s;ecurity again&s;t any &s;chemes to con|troul his de&s;igns, or plots to endanger his per&s;on. To my knowledge it gained him many adherents. Like &s;e|veral others, being in the twilight, and believing neither in God nor Devil, I did not well know what to think, but I re&s;olved not to continue long &s;o. A mark of gunpowder in the Duke's left arm, which I had been de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, and had often &s;een as he was changing his linen, per|plexed me not a little.</P>
<P>THE intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us bani&s;hed all ceremony; &s;o one evening as we were &s;itting together over our wine, I a&s;ked him directly if
<PB N="130" REF="138">it was true that he had &s;old him&s;elf to the Devil? He an&s;wered with a &s;mile, that it was perfectly true, and if I de&s;ired it, he would tell me the particulars. With my u&s;ual fidelity I &s;hall communicate them, as nearly as I can recollect, in the very words of His Highne&s;s, who &s;poke as follows: <Q>THIS whole bu&s;ine&s;s, about which &s;o much has been &s;aid, and &s;o little known, was a mere piece of knavery from the beginning to the ending. The Devil wanted to cheat me, and I wanted to cheat the Devil. Some years &s;ince as I was in my clo&s;et a&s;&s;orting &s;ome curious poi&s;ons which had been
<PB N="131" REF="139">&s;ent me by one of my Agents in ITALY for a few of my particular friends, a gentle tap called me to the door, which was locked. There I found SARPINI, one of the Grooms of my Chamber, a Nea|politan, a dome&s;tic at that time much in my confidence. After apologizing for the interruption, he told me he could procure me a vi&s;it from the Devil, if I cho&s;e to honour him with the commi&s;&s;ion; a friend of his, who was a Sorcerer, having a magical &s;ecret by which he could conjure him up from the regions of darkne&s;s. He added, that the Devil, being all-powerful, could appean in any di&s;gui&s;e I thought proper, and would come
<PB N="132" REF="140">either as a Monk or an Abb&eacute;, to avoid giving any &s;candal in the family; but that the Sorcerer was too poor to bear the expence of the charms and incantations nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e his Ma&s;ter, without a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from my liberality. Good, good! (an&s;wered I) by all means let him come; there is no one I re&s;pect more, and I &s;hall be impa|tient to &s;ee him. De&s;ire your friend the Sorcerer to make my humble duty: I &s;hall expect the honour of the Devil's company to|morrow exactly at midnight. At the &s;ame time I gave SARPINI an order for a con&s;iderable &s;um upon one of my Bankers at Paris, and bad him take care to have an excellent
<PB N="133" REF="141">&s;upper, and all &s;orts of liquors ready, that his Maje&s;ty might have no rea&s;on to complain of my ho&s;|pitality. The Devil (&s;ays he), my Lord! I believe, is not nice, but eats and drinks like other people; however, I will take care nothing &s;hall be wanting for his good re|ception; and away went the Nea|politan. PUNCTUAL to his hour, in &s;talked my vi&s;itor, in the habit of a Franci&s;can. He was a big tall Devil, above &s;ix feet high, with a hoar&s;e voice, and &s;peaking our lan|guage with a &s;trong German ac|cent and pronunciation. After the u&s;ual compliments, and my en|quiring
<PB N="134" REF="142">about his health, and his little family, he placed him&s;elf in a chair oppo&s;ite to me, and drank off a large gla&s;s of almo&s;t every wine on the table, to moi&s;ten about three pounds of a cold pa&s;ty and &s;our crout, which he crammed in as fa&s;t as if he had not ta&s;ted food for a fortnight. I thought the ra&s;cal would never have done &s;tuffing.
AT la&s;t we entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s. He promi&s;ed me mountains; I was to be the head of all the BOURBONS, to a&s;cend the throne, and live to be the olde&s;t man in all my domi|nions. He was to be always at my command, and though in|vi&s;ible,
<PB N="135" REF="143">to obey my orders as much as if he wore my livery and re|ceived my wages. In return for all this, I was to &s;ign a paper in my own blood, containing the re|ver&s;ionary grant of my &s;pirit to his di&s;po&s;al for ever. He drew a few drops of blood from my left arm with a lancet, after producing the bond which contained the terms of our agreement. The &s;ides were &s;crawled over with tails, claws and flames, and the middle was in red characters, which he a&s;|&s;ured me were traced in the blood of a new-born child, who&s;e throat had been cut expre&s;ly for the pur|po&s;e. I &s;igned my name, leaving out however the la&s;t letter, <HI>s,</HI> for
<PB N="136" REF="144">I was then CHARTRES. By this omi&s;&s;ion I concluded the condi|tion could not be exacted, as I &s;up|po&s;ed the Courts and Lawyers in the dominions beneath decreed and practi&s;ed much in the &s;ame way as ours, who always pay more regard to forms and trifles than to the &s;ub|&s;tance of the cau&s;e before them. Thus ended our interview. My Devil &s;talked off without appear|ing to di&s;cover the trick I had played him, and left me entirely &s;atisfied with the thoughts of hav|ing &s;o ingeniou&s;ly outwitted him. But I got to the bottom of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oon afterwards by means of another &s;ervant, who was either really attached to me, or was
<PB N="137" REF="145">jealous of my regard for SARPINI. My Devil, it &s;eems, was no other than a ra&s;cally German Mountebank, hired by the Nea|politan to trick me out of a good &s;um of money. The farce ended tragically for them. I had them both a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. By my order my Bravos told the Mountebank he had no right to complain, for if he was the Devil, as he pretended, they could do him no injury; if not, he de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed for attempting to &s;port with &s;o &s;acred a character, and to impo&s;e upon a Prince of the Blood Royal. The Neapolitan was &s;tabbed, and thrown into the River without any explanation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="146">THUS ended the DUKE's &s;tory.&mdash;He clo&s;ed it with an ob&s;ervation, which as it &s;hews at once his candour, his weak|ne&s;s and his ambition, de&s;erves to be re|membered. <Q>You &s;ee (&s;ays he), my friend, how two worthle&s;s varlets wanted to &s;port with my credulity; yet &s;uch is human nature, &s;o un|willing is the mind to relinqui&s;h any wi&s;h or de&s;ire which has taken deep root in the affections, that though I detected the cheat, tho' I know the fellow was an im|po&s;tor, without power to fore&s;ee events, or to influence them, yet I often throw the veil of delu&s;ion over my fancy, and half-clo&s;ing the eyes of my under&s;tanding, give my&s;elf up to the plea&s;ing reverie,

<P>I ENDEAVOURED at the time &s;till more to embody for him this chi|mera; and I mu&s;t do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to declare, that while he had any power, while any thing was left to him to give, no patriot behaved to him with more attachment and fide|lity than I did. I partook of his pro&s;perity in the mo&s;t friendly manner; but to avoid the appearance of &s;ingularity, I could not venture to adhere to him in his misfortunes. Alas, poor Prince! in &s;pite of his German Mountebank, his predicted throne is the &s;traw of a dungeon in
<PB N="140" REF="148">MARSEILLES, his dominions the ex|tent of his pri&s;on, his &s;ubjects rats and lizards, and his longevity will terminate when his former partizans have &s;ettled in what manner they can deprive him of his exi&s;tence mo&s;t conveniently for their own intere&s;t. We have &s;tripped him already of what was valuable, his money, and the worthle&s;s carca&s;e we con&s;ider but as lumber. We have be&s;ides the &s;a|tisfaction to reflect, that he has not what is called one principle or virtue left, which can give him a right to reproach us. If he offers to upbraid us with the &s;ums he has lavi&s;hedon us, we an&s;wer, they were &s;quandered for his own purpo&s;es, and his own ambi|tion. If he pre&s;umes to talk of our
<PB N="141" REF="149">ingratitude and cruelty, we refer him to his own conduct towards his Royal Kin&s;man and Benefactor, when he purcha&s;ed venal &s;uffrages for his con|demnation, and took the part of a pioneer in his murder; &s;o when darkne&s;s and death come upon him, as he lived unpitying, he will fall unpitied.</P>
<P>THE Conver&s;ation I have men|tioned pa&s;&s;ed between us on the eve of the KING's Execution. It was interrupted by the entrance of MARAT and the Nephew of DAMIEN. To the vigilance of the la&s;t we are obliged for the legalized murder of the SOVEREIGN. As the criminal law &s;tood on the day before
<PB N="142" REF="150">His MAJESTY'S Mock Trial, to con|demn capitally, a majority of one third part of the A&s;&s;embly pre&s;ent was requi&s;ite. By the addre&s;s of my friend we had the law changed on that very morning, and it was enacted, that the majority of a &s;ingle voice was &s;ufficient. He al&s;o exerci&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s his known talent for forgery. Mo&s;t of the papers pro|duced again&s;t the KING, as extracts from his letters and di&s;patches, were of this great man's fabricating. With|out them we &s;hould have had no|thing which could have &s;erved for evidence. The DUKE, MARAT, and I, who were in the &s;ecret, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed our&s;elves much by the vio|lence
<PB N="143" REF="151">lence with which we in&s;i&s;ted on their authenticity.</P>
<P>TOM PAINE a&s;&s;i&s;ted a good deal as to ordering the form of the Trial, by recommending to us the pre|cedent of King CHARLES the Fir&s;t of ENGLAND, who was murdered by his &s;ubjects much in the &s;ame way as we intended to di&s;po&s;e of our unfortunate Sovereign. TOM'S con|duct, who has now lo&s;t the confi|dence of his Con&s;tituents, by voting not for the King's death, only for his perpetual impri&s;onment, was for a time inexplicable. When it was ob|jected to him that the tendency of all his writings had been to recommend and &s;anctify the mo&s;t daring and vio|lent
<PB N="144" REF="152">exce&s;&s;es, and that the perturba|tors of the world were in fact but his Di&s;ciples, yet he had &s;hrunk from his own principles, and like a ba&s;e Rene|gade voted for mercy; he a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf, with exultation, all the merit due to his anarchical publica|tions, but tried in vain to reconcile them with his pu&s;illanimous &s;uffrage in the Convention. The &s;ub&s;tance of his defence was, that in the happy di&s;po&s;ition of the Nation, he knew very well nothing he could recom|mend, under the appearance of lenity, could have much weight, for the people were like tygers, who, once they had ta&s;ted blood, mu&s;t be gorged before they could be &s;atiated. Tho&s;e, he &s;aid, mu&s;t know him little who
<PB N="145" REF="153">could impute to him any &s;entiment of ju&s;tice or moderation, from which he was as con&s;cious of being exempt as any Reformer among our mil|lions; but he apprehended the KING'S public execution might be attended with embarra&s;&s;ing con&s;equences not immediately obvious; multitudes al|ready di&s;contented at home would be united by it, and every Nation in EUROPE with a King at its head, would be naturally &s;ummoned to take vengeance for an act which &s;et an example &s;o dangerous to every Regal Government. The people of AMERICA, he added, were known to di&s;approve of the mea&s;ure for &s;ome of the rea&s;ons by which he was influ|enced; it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to appear
<PB N="146" REF="154">to re&s;pect their &s;entiments, and in them it would be highly impolitic not to &s;eem, at lea&s;t, to remon&s;trate again&s;t the murder of a King who was ab&s;olute when he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with his fleets and armies; and that, in &s;hort, there were many different ways of annihilating a Royal Family, equally, effectual, and much le&s;s exceptionable, than a public execution on a &s;caffold. Thus did TOM attempt to di&s;play his wi&s;|dom, and to vindicate his con&s;i&s;tency. We knew him too well, not to &s;u&s;|pect his &s;incerity. We di&s;covered that he had taken a large bribe for his antiregicidal vote, and out of fal&s;e mode&s;ty was a&s;hamed to acknowledge it.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155">EUROPE has re&s;ounded &s;o loudly with the Trial and Execution of LOUIS, and we our&s;elves have made the whole &s;o public by details in our New&s;papers, that &s;trangers are al|mo&s;t as well acquainted with the particulars as we who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at both the &s;olemnities. I had the honour, as my reader may remember, to let fall the edge of the law on the neck of my Sovereign. We had thoughts of placing the Queen and her Chil|dren under the &s;caffold, that the blood of the Hu&s;band and Father might fall upon them; but recollecting that this embelli&s;hment of Ju&s;tice had been before introduced at the execution of NEMOURS by LOUIS the Eleventh, a King and a Tyrant, we rejected it;
<PB N="148" REF="156">yet, not to leave the public mind un|&s;atisfied, we treated the Royal Cap|tives with every rigour and indignity which human cruelty could devi&s;e, after the Murder of His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>BUT, not with &s;tanding all our merit in this heroical and nece&s;&s;ary act of Ju&s;tice, it evidently did not give uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction to the people in general. It became nece&s;&s;ary there|fore to divert their thoughts to &s;ome other &s;ubject, and chance kindly pre|&s;ented it to us. It happened mo&s;t op|portunely, that on the very day of the execution, the Demigod PLATTER-BREECH, &s;pinning him&s;elf thro' the &s;treets as u&s;ual, was cru&s;hed to death by the Cavalry which guarded the
<PB N="149" REF="157">King to the &s;caffold He was ma&s;hed as if he had been brayed in a mortar. His la&s;t wi&s;h, as we heard, was, that his cata&s;trophe might be &s;erviceable to Liberty: mo&s;t luckily, his I latter received no injury.</P>
<P>I IMMEDIATELY informed the Convention of the misfortune which had deprived us of PLATTER BREECH, with many encomiums on the virtues of the decea&s;ed, who, like my&s;elf, was a Member of that augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly. I moved that his remains &s;hould be honoured with a decree for their public interment, in a &s;tyle the mo&s;t magnificent. Collecting all my powers of oratory, I &s;poke in the Senate as follows;</P>
<Q><PB N="150" REF="158">
<P>SINCE the People of FRANCR have broke the de&s;potic yoke they groaned under, her revolutionary annals offer no epoch more &s;trik|ing than the pre&s;ent, when we &s;ee almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant the Guardian of Liberty unfortunately cru&s;hed by the feet of his friends, and a Tyrant decollated by the Sword of Ju&s;tice.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>FORMATION OF THE SELECT COM|MITTEE, OR CABINET.&mdash;OF WHOM COMPOSED.&mdash;MANNER OF ADMINI|STERING JUSTICE.&mdash;WISDOM OF MARAT.&mdash;EDUCATION NOT NEGLECT|ED.&mdash;FORM OF RETURNS MADE TO THE COMMITTEE.&mdash;PRIVATE LIFE OF THE CABINET.&mdash;THE RED NIGHT-CAP PRE|FERABLE TO CHARITY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR domination was now in ap|pearance pretty well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The KING murdered; the QUEEN almo&s;t bowed to the grave with the weight of her afflictions, and &s;uffering with her Children and Si&s;ter-in-Law all the mi&s;ery which a pri&s;on and hard treatment could in|flict
<PB N="155" REF="163">on the vile&s;t criminals; the Nobility exiled, plundered, or but|chered; the Clergy hanged, and the people half &s;tarving; our next care was to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the perma|nency of all this power and felicity which we had thus noly acquired.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e we had many meetings at the <HI>Palais Royal.</HI> All who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the ma&s;&s;acres, women as well as men, were at fir&s;t admitted, but little of im|portance was determined in &s;uch mixed and numerous A&s;&s;emblies. All talked together at the &s;ame time, every one boa&s;ting of his own exploits, and &s;eeming to think more of what was already performed than of arranging
<PB N="156" REF="164">matters for the &s;uture. <Q>I ripped up the entrails of ten Swi&s;s (cried one) who were lying together with their hands tied behind them&mdash;</Q><Q>I &s;tabbed two Duche&s;&s;es, three Bi&s;hops, and a fat Barone&s;s (roared another), and here's a piece of her liver,</Q> which he produced from his pocket&mdash; <Q>I &s;trangled &s;even Children in the nur&s;ery (&s;ays a third) before the face of their parents;&mdash;</Q> and thus they went on. Their vanity, in &s;hort, was into|lerable.</P>
<P>WE got them away as well as we could, and when they were gone, agreed to form a private Committee, which &s;hould be the &s;oul and centre
<PB N="157" REF="165">of every thing. Citizen EQUALITY was allowed to be Chairman, or Pre&s;ident: the Committee con&s;i&s;ted of ROBESPIERRE, MARAT, and My&s;elf; EQUALITY was to have two voices, when nece&s;&s;ary upon a divi&s;ion, in order to throw in his ca&s;ting-vote, that nothing might re|main undetermined. At times we had &s;ome trouble to keep him quiet, for every now and then he gave us hints that the hour was come to pro|claim him King, which we knew had been his object from the begin|ning; but we put him off as often on different pretences. MARAT, I re|member, was once obliged to tell him, that if he did not hold his tongue, he would denounce him of
<PB N="158" REF="166">incivi&s;m, put him into a &s;tate of accu|&s;ation, and give him up to the Revo|lutionary Tribunal. The terror of this threat always kept him &s;ilent.</P>
<P>SANSTERRE, DANTON, THOURIOT, GORSAS, MERLIN, HENRIOT, Ma|dame TEROIGNE, my Mother, and others, were at times admitted to con&s;ultations, and their opinions taken upon matters, when we wi&s;hed to extend re&s;pon&s;ibility. Not one of the per&s;ons I have ju&s;t mentioned but might have officiated with propriety as High-Prie&s;t at the Altar of MOLOCH.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome time, indeed, the Select Committee did not do &s;o much good
<PB N="159" REF="167">as might have been expected. Our meetings often ended only in getting drunk and quarrelling. MARAT and I had twice a fierce di&s;pute, each claim|ing to him&s;elf the honour of having &s;laughtered a family in the <HI>Rue Co|lombiere</HI>; and the Ruffian finding I had the advantage while we kept to our tongues, whipped out his knife, and &s;truck me twice in the face with it. I retain the mark of his handy|work, and had not my good fortune averted the point a little, I might have lo&s;t my left eye; &s;o I &s;hould have re&s;embled LYCURGUS not only in being a Legi&s;lator, but a Monoculi&s;t. No man ever had from the womb of his mother a temper more fierce, or a di&s;po&s;ition, more &s;an|guinary
<PB N="160" REF="168">than my PYLADES: he was born with all tho&s;e fine pro|pen&s;ities which Naturali&s;ts a&s;cribe to the Tiger-Cat and the Hyaena; and if his &s;pirit ever tran&s;migrates, it will certainly re&s;ide in one of the&s;e animals hereafter. His di&s;tempers and the evil habit of his body, how|ever, have increa&s;ed his malignity, and filled his ve&s;&s;els with a more cor|roding vitriol; for, like NAAMAN, the Syrian, <Q>he is a mighty man, but he is a Leper.</Q> The Nephew of DAMIEN (who always fomented our altercations from the mere hope of blood&s;hed) is by nature not le&s;s cruel, but being like DRANCES, <HI>lingu&aacute; melior, &s;edfrigida bello dextra,</HI> he contents him&s;elf with recom|mending
<PB N="161" REF="169">&s;laughter, and in prai&s;ing the perpetrators, but leaves exe|cution to us. He will indeed &s;tab, or cut a throat when we hold a vic|tim for him, but he never o&s;&s;ers to attack where there appears to be the lea&s;t danger of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>AFTER many di&s;putes, much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and frequent adjournments, we at la&s;t agreed to the following Regulations.</P>
<P>As our Revolution was com|pletely unlike any other ever heard of, we agreed to &s;upport it by means as novel. All other Legi&s;lators, from the time of MOSES to the pre&s;ent hour, began by founding the State in
<PB N="162" REF="170">the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Religion, and in &s;ecuring a maintenance for the Mini&s;ters of the Altar: we opened by aboli&s;hing Religion, and continuing to plunder and hang the Clergy. In all other nations certainacts called crimes, &s;uch as parricide, murder, &s;acrilege, robbery, perjury, maiming, and the re&s;t, were defined, brought under a particular de&s;cription, prohibited, and a penalty annexed re&s;pectively to their commi&s;&s;ion. The law was made general, without di&s;tinction of per&s;ons, and promulgated. We made a particular law for every particular ca&s;e, and leaving all things to the di&s;cretion of the Judge, the Court's deci&s;ion became an example without being a precedent; &s;o that from &s;uch
<PB N="163" REF="171">capricious authorities no knowledge could be gained, nor no rule e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. It could not indeed be well otherwi&s;e, as may be &s;een by the fol|lowing di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>IF an Ari&s;tocrate, in defending his own life again&s;t a Sans Culotte, who attacked him pike or poniard in hand, happened to kill the a&s;&s;ailant, he was <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> condemned to death; if, on the contrary, a Sans Culotte, after robbing an Ari&s;tocrate, killed him, a Civic Crown was decreed to him, he was admitted to the honour of the Sitting with applau&s;es, and re|&s;pectable mention made of the tran&s;|action in the Minutes of the Coven|tion. It would have been no le&s;s
<PB N="164" REF="172">difficult in many other in&s;tances to make the law general. The excep|tions would have been more nume|rous than the ca&s;es coming under the rule. In&s;tead of a general prohibition (as may be &s;een above) again&s;t kil|ling, our code only meant, <Q>Thou &s;halt not kill a Sans Culotte.</Q> In|&s;tead of "Thou &s;halt not &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">", it meant, <Q>Thou &s;halt &s;teal from every one except a Sans Culotte;</Q> and &s;o with the re&s;t of the Decalogue.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e points there was no divi&s;ion of opinion. The &s;ame una|nimity appeared in the Cabinet upen the following:
<PB N="165" REF="173">THAT it was for the good of the State to oppre&s;s, harra&s;s, de&s;troy, and utterly extirpate by all po&s;&s;ible means every per&s;on &s;u&s;pected of having the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to birth, education, property, talents, or integrity, with a &s;aving for Citizen EQUALITY, who was de&s;cended from the Royal Family, and had learned to dance, and ride the great hor&s;e. Upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e points, his high birth, he always a&s;&s;ured us no exemption was nece&s;&s;ary, for he was not legiti|mately a BOURBON, but the &s;on of a Coachman.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o agreed, that all inno|cent per&s;ons &s;hould be condemned, and all the guilty acquitted; that the
<PB N="166" REF="174">&s;imple accu&s;ation of a &s;ingle Sans Cu|lotte &s;hould be con&s;idered as &s;ufficient for the conviction of ten Ari&s;tocrates; and that the te&s;timony of ten Ari&s;to|crates, though taken &s;eparately, and all concurring in proof of the crime of a Sans Culotte, &s;hould be con&s;i|dered as perjury; and that they &s;hould &s;tand three times in the Pillory, with a paper fa&s;tened to their brea&s;ts, with the&s;e words in Capital Letters, "CALUMNY AND PERJURY."</P>
<P>IN order to complete the &s;lavery of the Public, and to &s;ecure our own authority, we re&s;olved to have the word LIBERTY for ever in our mouths, and a drawn Dagger in our hands as con&s;tantly; to men|tion

<P>MARAT, with more good &s;en&s;e than I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be ma&s;ter of, &s;aying that nothing kept the people &s;o much in awe of a Government as a con&s;tant &s;tate of terror, propo&s;ed to have a Guillotine in every &s;treet, and to chop off the heads of all who were &s;u&s;pected of di&s;content, or
<PB N="169" REF="177">heard to utter the lea&s;t murmur again&s;t our Admini&s;tration, without any other formality than our de|nunciation. This idea we in a great mea&s;ure adopted, and it proved a very whole&s;ome expedient. Be&s;ides the di&s;|play of our power, it was attended by the&s;e two good con&s;equences: Such as we &s;uffered to remain alive were obliged to us for their exi&s;tence, and we got rid of a number of mouths by de&s;troying &s;uch a multitude of people; for who does not know that the dead neither eat nor prattle? In order to keep things quiet, he al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of two hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and people all together, pledging him&s;elf at the &s;ame time, to get the bu&s;ine&s;s done in the mo&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="178">&s;atisfactory manner. We liked the motion much, and for a time gave into it; but upon mature con&s;idera|tion we were obliged to relinqui&s;h it, &s;olely becau&s;e it did not &s;eem probable that &s;uch a multitude would &s;uffer their throats to be cut without a certain degree of trouble&s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. By this for bearance, when the temptation was &s;o &s;trong, we made a great &s;a|crifice to prudence, for we, &s;hould a&s;&s;uredly have acquired great popu|larity by the ma&s;&s;acre; but popularity may &s;ometimes be purcha&s;ed too dearly.</P>
<P>WE were not inattentive to the education of our youth. By the &s;ame Edict which forbad parents to &s;uffer
<PB N="171" REF="179">their children to go to Church, tend|ing only to effeminate their minds and to infect their morals, we en|joined a &s;ub&s;titutionary exerci&s;e much more likely to prepare them to be good Citizens, and u&s;eful members of the Democracy. A certain number of unadults in every di&s;trict, from the age of eight to fourteen, were ordered to attend the waggons which carried off the dead bodies of &s;uch as were ma&s;&s;acred. The&s;e children were to be in&s;tructed how to pack the car|ca&s;es &s;o as to lye mo&s;t conveniently, and take up lea&s;t room in the vehicle. This in&s;titution not only &s;erved to make them handy, but to familiarize them to &s;pectacles from which tender minds are too apt to revolt. Thus
<PB N="172" REF="180">we laid a foundation to &s;ecure the pa|trioti&s;m and confirm the fortitude of the ri&s;ing generation. Another ad|vantage is al&s;o likely to re&s;ult from it. The reli&s;h for human fle&s;h is be|ginning to prevail much in our country. Should it ever become an article of exportation (as it probably may be), our infants will thus have learned one branch of a trade which may bring in large &s;ums to the People's Exchequer; our young fe|males may &s;oon be taught to become &s;alters; and we &s;hall then be able to under&s;ell all our neigbours, not only from our greater abundance of the exportable commodity, but from the &s;uperior excellence of the manu|facture, no nation having taken &s;uch
<PB N="173" REF="181">wi&s;e precautions as we have done to &s;ecure a preference in this article of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT is a vulgar error to &s;uppo&s;e that human fle&s;h is not palatable. I have ta&s;ted it often, and never without plea&s;ure. Even a woman of &s;eventy, provided &s;he has not been what is called an Old Maid, eats well with vinegar, mu&s;tard, and red pepper. The fair &s;ex in general are preferable to males, and the younger the better, no doubt; but all mouths cannot expect delicacies. An Iri&s;h Child which has been fed on milk and potatoes, particularly from the Province of Mun&s;ter, is a nicer di&s;h with &s;pinach than any hou&s;e-lamb
<PB N="174" REF="182">I ever &s;aw &s;erved to table. Sa|vages, who&s;e appetites are unadulte|rated, prefer a human broil to any viand what&s;oever; and this well-known fact mu&s;t get the better of all &s;peculation, and remove all pre|judice.</P>
<P>THESE were the Arcana of our Government. With what awe mu&s;t not the world be &s;truck when it con|templates the per&s;onages who com|po&s;ed our Cabinet, and the great ob|jects which engaged our attention. All that is held dear by mankind was at our di&s;po&s;al; the fate of near twenty millions of per&s;ons depended entirely on our &s;upreme will and plea&s;ure. I have taken the remain|ing
<PB N="175" REF="183">population of FRANCE at this amount; for notwith&s;tanding all the boa&s;ting of &s;ome Patriots, I do not believe, from the hour when BERTHIER and FOULON were mur|dered, we have, upon the whole, exiled and de&s;troyed five millions. To hear &s;ome people talk one would think the number had been con&s;ider|able. My computation, I am certain, is pretty aceurate. As to what was done at PARIS, I know within a thou|&s;and; the whole does not amount to half a million. With regard to the provincial returns I cannot be po|&s;itive, becau&s;e we detected conceal|ments of the number in &s;everal places, and accounts exaggerated from motives of intere&s;t or vanity in
<PB N="176" REF="184">others. We have, however, the &s;a|tisfaction to think that the work is but begun; and if fortune be not un|propitious, and no intervention hap|pens of accidents impo&s;&s;ible to be fore&s;een, we are likely to be ble&s;&s;ed with a continuance of the&s;e happy convul&s;ions at lea&s;t for fifty years longer.</P>

<P>THE good-natured part of the world will no doubt be anxious for our private &s;ituation. It will naturally
<PB N="179" REF="187">&s;uppo&s;e us worn down with fatigue, and in&s;ufferably harra&s;&s;ed by the mul|tiplicity of our occupations. But let me remove this anxiety, for in truth we were as much objects of envy in our private, as we were of admira|tion in our public capacity. Every thing had its proper time and place. The Committee of Murder &s;at for two hours three times every week; the Committee of Plunder as often; and half an hour on Sundays &s;erved for the Committee to propagate Im|piety. Nothing could be more ea&s;y and expeditious. EQUALITY lived as u&s;ual, in all the luxury of his pa|lace; ROBESPIERRE, my PYLADES, and I, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of the three be&s;t Hotels at PARIS, after
<PB N="180" REF="188">hanging the owners at the door; we found the cellars well &s;tored, the &s;tables full of good hor&s;es; and the fund for public exigencies &s;upplied us with every thing we could de&s;ire for our private gratification. The plunder of the Royal Jewels and Ca|binets at VERSAILLES and PARIS were an inexhau&s;tible mine to us. We lived, in &s;hort, in the fir&s;t &s;tyle, like the mo&s;t opulent Noblemen, like the NEMOURS, the ROCHEFOUCAULTS, the LIANCOURTS, the BRISACS, the HARCOURTS, and others, whom we pillaged or murdered. There was no difference in our grandeur or our appearance, except that the&s;e Noble|men wore hats, and we wore the Red Night-Cap.
<Q><PB N="181" REF="189">CHARITY (&s;ays the Scripture) covereth a multitude of &s;ins.</Q> I &s;ay, the Red Night-Cap covers them much better, and in a greater abundance.</P>
<P>THOUGH, perhaps, it may be ra|ther beneath the dignity of a French Reformer to enter into a &s;ort of conte&s;tation with a Chri&s;tian Apo&s;tle, yet I will conde&s;cend once, for the exemplification of truth, to lay before the Public all the in&s;ipid qualities a&s;cribed by St. PAUL to what he calls the virtue of Charity, and let them be compared with the more energetic properties which belong to the Red Night-Cap.
<PB N="182" REF="190"><Q>CHARITY (&s;ays the Tent-maker of TARSUS) &s;uffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Cha|rity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up; Charity doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things. Cha|rity never faileth.</Q></P>
<P>THUS much in favour of Charity. <HI>Audi alteram partem!</HI> Hear now the Advocate for the Red Night-Cap.</P>
<P>THE RED NIGHT-CAP never &s;uf|fers the &s;lighte&s;t injury without taking vengeance for it, and is of a noble fero|city.
<PB N="183" REF="190">The Red Night-Cap with good &s;en&s;e envies every thing that is worthy of envy, and having proper pride, on every occa&s;ion makes the be&s;t di&s;play of its own merits. The Red Night-Cap de&s;pi&s;es a finical at|tention to behaviour or courte&s;y, and not only &s;eeks and keeps its own, but &s;eizes every thing which belongs to other people. The mere&s;t trifles provoke the high &s;pirit of the Red Night-Cap, and it knows mankind too well not to do them ju&s;tice by having a bad opinion of them. It re|joiceth in acts of heroi&s;m which are mi&s;called iniquity, and has too much ingenuity to pay any regard to truth, a &s;trict adherence to which is infal|libly an indication of deficient parts
<PB N="184" REF="192">and abundant &s;tupidity. The fiery genius of the Red Night-Cap is not like a hor&s;e or an a&s;s made to bear any thing; while &s;o far from believ|ing all things, it does not even be|lieve in God, and cannot endure to be &s;eriou&s;ly told of &s;uch chimeras as Virtue, Religion, and a World to come. As to the never-failing part of Charity, it is not half &s;o infallible as the Red Night-Cap, for even the Pope him&s;elf has been obliged to ac|knowledge its infallibility, and many of the Saints in his calendar, nay, the Virgin MARY have been com|pelled to wear it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the arduous ta&s;k I have undertaken, not only to lay before the world an ac|count of my life and actions, but the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of my heart, inter&s;per|&s;ed &s;o frequently with the characters and conduct of tho&s;e eminent men
<PB N="187" REF="195">who were my coadjutors, without omitting a &s;ummary relation of many extraordinary events which &s;tand prominent in our annals for near four years, I mu&s;t acknowledge it gives me plea&s;ure to find that my labours are drawing towards a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>FOR what relates to my&s;elf, I have turned my mind in&s;ide out to the Public, as fairly as the ingenious Mr. BARRINGTON turned in&s;ide out the pockets of the le&s;s ingenious Mr. GRAY, with the very in&s;trument the former devi&s;ed and the latter exe|cuted. Authenticity, the true touch|&s;tone of hi&s;torical merit, will be found better here than in any of the nume|rous publications occa&s;ioned by our
<PB N="188" REF="196">numerous Revolutions. Others have written but as Spectators, I claim the dignity of an Actor. Much of what I relate I have created, and may therefore, without pre&s;umption, a&s;|&s;ert a &s;uperiority over every other Relator of Facts, <HI>quorum pars magna &s;ui.</HI> Although a little partiality for my beloved Countrymen may per|haps be now and then di&s;cernible, it has never induced the willing mi&s;|tatement of any important tran&s;ac|tion, or any inference glaringly tinc|tured with prejudice. The &s;tation I now occupy, and the country I re&s;ide in, &s;o detached from, and inde|pendent of my own, remove from my mind any apprehen&s;ions of expo&s;ing my&s;elf to inconvenience or danger
<PB N="189" REF="197">from the re&s;entment of Frenchmen, who may affect to think they have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, or their names treated with too little re&s;pect in the cour&s;e of my Confe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>FROM what has been communi|cated, a Reader of common &s;agacity may find a <HI>Clavis</HI> to the true meaning of many tran&s;actions which other|wi&s;e would remain inexplicable. By taking our words in a &s;en&s;e exactly oppo&s;ite to their u&s;ual acceptation, and our theory as the very rever&s;e of our practice, he will penetrate at once to the bottom of the my&s;tery. He will find the nominal Government of Re|pre&s;entatives in the Convention means the real Government of the Mob who
<PB N="190" REF="198">elected them; he will find our Courts of Ju&s;tice, Tribunals for the acquittal of the Guilty, and the condemnation of the Innocent; and our mild Ordi|nances, <HI>quemlibet occidunt populariter,</HI> like the laws of DRACO, written all in blood: he will find our Equality means pulling down all that is called re&s;pectable or &s;acred in &s;ociety, to level it with all that is vile and igno|minious; and our Liberty the mo&s;t con&s;ummate De&s;poti&s;m. When we recommended peace, we were prepar|ing to wage war; and while we pro|fe&s;&s;ed to make mankind free, we were forging for them the mo&s;t intolerable &s;hackles.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="199">BUT our policy at lea&s;t de&s;erves ad|miration. By pacific profe&s;&s;ions we lulled the Nations which were weak enough to believe us into a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and torpor, and immediately took advantage of their credulous o&s;citancy. Add to this, that we could not exi&s;t in a &s;tate of pacification. Where could we find employment for our turbulent Millions but in war? When agriculture is &s;o much ne|glected that we are threatened every month with famine, from our Plow|men being converted into Politicians, how could the&s;e &s;warms of idle gap|ing boobies find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence without being di&s;per&s;ed into the countries of our neighbours? With what addre&s;s did we not cheri&s;h di&s;contents, foment
<PB N="192" REF="200">&s;edition, and di&s;&s;eminate our vi&s;ionary projects of Reformation even in ENGLAND, that be&s;t governed, mo&s;t free, and happy Kingdom in the Univer&s;e? With what true Gallic alacrity did we not pledge our&s;elves to dethrone her King, and &s;end a Citizen General, with our Ragamuf|fins and her own, to give new laws to GREAT BRITAIN, and riot in the Royal Apartments at St. JAMES'S? With what genuine Democratic au|dacity did we not hurl the gauntlet at the face of every Sovereign and Regal Government in EUROPE; and with what incomparable hypo|cri&s;y did we not afterwards complain that they attacked and invaded us?</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="210">THE wretched people of SAVOY fir&s;t felt the benefit of our kind <HI>Fra|ternization.</HI> After we had drained her poverty to the la&s;t &s;ad penny; after our troops, like a whirlwind, had &s;wept away her cottages, her corn, her cattle, and her inhabitants; we re&s;olved to turn our arms towards the North, and in the &s;ame manner to <HI>fraternize</HI> the Brabanters.</P>
<P>As the full meaning of this new term may not perhaps be perfectly un|der&s;tood by all my Readers, let them take the following explanation.</P>
<P>SHOULD any Prince refu&s;e to accept our parchment for money, or to let us new-model his Government, we com|plain of his in&s;olence, and the ill treat|ment
<PB N="194" REF="202">we have received from him. We denounce him by a decree of the Convention as our enemy, a Tyrant, and a De&s;pot. We declare his &s;ub|jects to be our brethren, ab&s;olved from their bonds of allegiance and fidelity, and free from that moment; and that we are going to make war upon the De&s;pot only, not upon the people, who are always to con&s;ider them&s;elves as our brothers. Imme|diately upon this, fifty or a hundred thou&s;and of our brave <HI>Sans Culottes</HI> invade his dominions, overturn the altars, bury dead hor&s;es or pigs under the communion-table of the great church, ravage the country, &s;ack the towns, burn the hou&s;es, rob the men, ravi&s;h the women, let the
<PB N="195" REF="203">De&s;pot e&s;cape, and &s;laughter the people. As the war is made only again&s;t the Tyrant, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that no injury is intended again&s;t his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e ju&s;t and unavoidable acts of ho&s;tility, we convene the mi|&s;erable remnant of the natives who have e&s;caped from our heroic fury in &s;ome public place. We fir&s;t make an eloquent harangue of con&s;iderable length, which always gives great &s;atisfaction, in prai&s;e of our own lenity and moderation; then we give them an embrace, clap a Red Night-Cap on their heads, take away all their arms and money, pronounce
<PB N="196" REF="204">them free, and our brothers; &s;o in this manner they are <HI>fraternized.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that taking the matter in a certain light, they are our Brothers, that is, as CAIN was the Brother of ABEL, for CAIN mur|dered his dear Brother ABEL. Were I to attempt an an&s;wer to every ac|cu&s;ation and invective which has been poured out upon us &s;ince the year 1789, I &s;hould have no right to con|gratulate my&s;elf upon the pro&s;pect of concluding my labours. I might begin, but I know not where would be the termination. Of a few which are ea&s;ily obviated, I &s;hall conde&s;cend to take &s;ome &s;light notice.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="205">WE hear on every &s;ide that our fir&s;t &s;teps were wrong, and that we have advanced in the mire only to flounder deeper. The&s;e Speculati&s;ts, the&s;e cool pen-and-ink Politicians tell us, we &s;hould have limited the Regal Power, not have aboli&s;hed Royalty, and cruelly murdered our benevo|lent, our public-&s;pirited Sovereign; and that our barbarity to his calum|niated Queen, and unoffending Chil|dren, is unprovoked, unexampled, and hideou&s;ly atrocious; that we ought to have removed the oppre&s;&s;ive Seigneural Rights of our Nobles, not have exiled or ma&s;&s;acred them, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e excellent men who of &s;uch rights had made a voluntary &s;urrender; that we &s;hould have
<PB N="198" REF="206">&s;ettled a competent provi&s;ion for our Curates by &s;ome new fund, or have waited at lea&s;t till by the death of the incumbents, Church Revenues too exorbitant reverted to the Com|munity, not have plundered our Bi&s;hops without mercy, and hanged them or cut their throats after|wards.</P>
<P>As one &s;hort an&s;wer may &s;erve to di&s;patch the&s;e three objections at once, I &s;hall give it. When any mea&s;ure is nece&s;&s;ary, the mo&s;t &s;peedy method of effecting it is be&s;t. Could a LACED AEMONIAN, the greate&s;t enemy to prolixity, have devi&s;ed any more expeditious than that which we adopted, Sudden Death? They tell
<PB N="199" REF="207">us be&s;ides, that we &s;hould have ex|empted the poor from taxes, and left the rich to &s;upply them, not have quadrupled our public expences, and left none able to pay them. Do they not know, then, that no man in FRANCE pays any thing but as he choo&s;es, which is Liberty, or when compelled by the pike or the bayonet, another &s;pecies of it; becau&s;e we call the&s;e compul&s;ory contributions, not by the odious name of Taxes, but Loans and Free Gifts, though the Loan is never paid back, and the Free Gift is always extorted; and what can be more &s;atisfactory to a free people, as the French now are?</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="208">WE are a&s;ked, with a &s;ort of tri|umphant in&s;olence, Did &s;uch furious exce&s;&s;es, &s;uch &s;avage licentiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch execrable cruelties ever before prevail in any civilized country? Why&mdash;Yes. GREECE, where De|mocracy flouri&s;hed, was often in a condition almo&s;t as di&s;tracted. Was ROME much better during the pro|&s;criptions of MARIUS and SYLLA? and after the death of CAESAR, under the bloody Triumvirate? or at the irruption of the Scourge of GOD, ATTILA, GENSERIC, and their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors? Was JERUSALEM upon ro&s;es when torn within by the fac|tions of JOHN and SIMON, and in|ve&s;ted without by the Legions of TITUS? In that City a mother was
<PB N="201" REF="209">compelled to eat her own child from hunger; our Ladies eat the children of their enemies to &s;atiate their re|venge, or to prove their civi&s;m. The ca&s;es are widely different. Was ENGLAND a Paradi&s;e when YORK and LANCASTER drew forth their battles, or in the Civil Wars of King CHARLES and his Parliament? But to bring things nearer to our own aera, when the Fifty Sons of MULEY ISMAEL de&s;olated their country with fifty civil wars all together, was the condition of MOROCCO much le&s;s ca|lamitous? No&mdash;We have the plea|&s;ure to reflect, and it is the true <HI>&s;olamen mi&s;eris,</HI> the &s;oft balm to the afflicted, that other nations have had their periods of adver&s;ity, and that
<PB N="202" REF="210">they wanted but our numbers and our &s;pirit to be nearly as invelved and ferocious as we are.</P>
<P>BUT human wi&s;dom, human logic, human crimination are not &s;ufficient; the Artillery of Heaven mu&s;t al&s;o be drawn down upon us. Divine vengeance, we are told, has already overtaken us, not only in the multi|plied mi&s;eries we labour under, but in the particular puni&s;hment of the very individuals who were mo&s;t in|&s;trumental in bringing about our barbarous Revolutions. Our Generals and Officers (they &s;ay), tho&s;e double traitors, fal&s;e to their oaths and their honour, are to a man pro&s;cribed, im|pri&s;oned, or beheaded. Why, granted&mdash;
<PB N="203" REF="211">I know nothing about divine venge|ance, nor ever will believe in &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious folly; but I know the fate of the&s;e men does not proceed from any cele&s;tial interpo&s;ition, but from the very nature of Democracy, which has been the &s;ame in all ages and countries, and will for ever con|tinue to be the &s;ame; for which rea|&s;on Soldiers who have common &s;en&s;e &s;hould be of all men the mo&s;t aver&s;e to it. What &s;aid the excellent PHOCION, when dragged on a hurdle to an un|ju&s;t death by the People of ATHENS? <HI>Hunc exitum plerique clari viri habu|erunt Athenien&s;es,"</HI> as NEPOS has tran&s;|lated it, <Q>Such mu&s;t be the exit of all eminence where there is &s;uch a Con&s;titution, and Liberty likeours.</Q>
<PB N="204" REF="212">Democracy is a kind of dunghill, which cheri&s;hes nothing but weeds to grow to any height in it.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;ked tauntingly, Where is ORLEANS? Where is LA FAYETTE? Where is PETION? Where BRISSOT? Where CONDORCET? Where MARAT? Where TOM PAINE? Where a thou|&s;and others, once &s;o popular, now &s;o dete&s;ted? I an&s;wer, EQUALITY is in a dungeon; &s;ome have fled, &s;ome are impri&s;oned, many are hanged, my PYLADES is a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and TOM PAINE is in a quarry-hole. But I a&s;k, Is it not natural? Was it not expect|ed? Could it be otherwi&s;e? Does any human creature wonder at their fate, or pity them?</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="213">UPON the whole, then, our adver|&s;aries pre&s;ume to tell us, that we have done nothing but to bring in|delible di&s;grace and durable woe upon our&s;elves; and to confirm, by our example, the &s;ubjects of Govern|ments the mo&s;t arbitrary to acquie&s;ce under any mode of being governed, rather than expo&s;e them&s;elves by re|bellion to that wild and capricious &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion which always re|&s;ults from anarchy, or the &s;upremacy of the rabble.</P>
<P>Is it then nothing to have deraci|nated a &s;uper&s;titious faith, and a fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of enervating morality? Is it nothing to have inve&s;ted with the robes of legi&s;lations, and to have
<PB N="206" REF="214">placed on the benches of ju&s;tice, an ignorant and &s;turdy banditti, who in the dull cour&s;e of former u&s;age would only have been con&s;igned to the gallies or the executioner? Is it no|thing to have demoli&s;hed in a few months that awful fabric of &s;ocial concord which the painful re&s;earches, the united experience of &s;o much fal&s;e virtue, learning, and wi&s;dom, had endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h for &s;o many centuries? Is novelty nothing? Is a thrice-told tale more intere&s;ting than a fre&s;h and lively invention? Is the re&s;toration of Pagani&s;m nothing? Nothing to make many Gods of our own, in&s;tead of allowing that one God was our Creator? But above all, is it nothing to have rendered the
<PB N="207" REF="215">name of FRENCHMAN as tremendous to human nature as hurricanes, vol|canoes, and earthquakes? Let the&s;e interrogatories be an&s;wered, before our antagoni&s;ts come forward again with new ca&s;ui&s;try and fre&s;h a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn how little weight there is in the arguments of our op|ponents, I will now &s;hew how little truth there is in &s;ome of their a&s;&s;e|verations,</P>
<P>EVERY writer (they affirm) of candour and information who was an Advocate for our Revolution at fir&s;t, particularly in ENGLAND, retracts his opinion, and either vindicates his original &s;entiments by declaring that
<PB N="208" REF="216">the abu&s;es of our former &s;lavi&s;h Government required Reformation, but that our exce&s;&s;es have gone be|yond all imagination; or he a&s;&s;erts, that our nominal Con&s;titution being but a line for us to deviate from, we are actuated by cruel frenzy only, and mu&s;t be le&s;t to grope our way through Chaos and Anarchy in the dark as we got into it; and &s;o he leaves us. That &s;ome Writers, and perhaps of the above de&s;cription, have acted in this tergiver&s;ive manner I deny not; but it is not the ca&s;e with all.</P>
<P>THE ingenious Traveller Mr. RICHARD TWISS, better known in ENGLAND by the name of TUMBLE|DUNG,
<PB N="209" REF="217">from his fondne&s;s for that In&s;ect of which he has publi&s;he the Natural Hi&s;tory, has never re|ceded from his early opinion in our favour. He was too much frightened it is true to leave his garret, and be a &s;pectator of our ma&s;&s;acres in Augu&s;t and September, but he had the plea|&s;ure, in ea&s;e and &s;afety, to view the carnage afterwards. How congenial are his &s;entiments with our own! <Q>There is (he &s;ays) &s;omething di&s;|gu&s;ting, perhaps, in &s;eeing a &s;ingle dead body, but thou&s;ands of carca&s;es in a heap, and tumbled all together, excite rather a plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation.</Q> No in&s;idel can &s;peak with more con|tempt of our Religion, or expre&s;s more philo&s;ophical &s;atisfaction at the
<PB N="210" REF="218">de&s;poiling of our Churches. How does he extol the amiable, the pa|triotic fiercene&s;s of the Fair Sex, who not only ripped up the vitals of the SWISS they had murdered, but wore their bloody &s;hirts for turbans, and &s;erved up their joints broiled or roa&s;ted as a repa&s;t for their little in|nocent, hungry families! He does not proclaim that he was an <HI>Anthropophagos,</HI> but he clearly does not di&s;approve of Canibali&s;m, and by implication recommends the experi|ment. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To read his Tour, would not one ima|gine he was rendering back the reeking &s;teams his effigy had inhaled at the bottom of &s;o many chamber-uten&s;ils in Ireland?</NOTE></P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, that having paid for his pa&s;&s;port at the Secretary of
<PB N="211" REF="219">State's Office in LONDON, and hav|ing got it for nothing at PARIS, the contra&s;t was enough to di&s;gu&s;t and incen&s;e him again&s;t his native country, and to ju&s;tify his wi&s;hing to &s;ee it as mi&s;erable as FRANCE; but this ought not to impeach his impar|tiality; for can it be conceived, that the &s;aving of forty &s;hillings could counter-balance all the terrors he &s;melt under during the delays he ex|perienced before he could procure his permi&s;&s;ion to depart from us? His &s;entiments clearly flow from his un|der&s;tanding and his principles. Over|looked, neglected, or derided, as he is at home, I cannot forbear to pro&s;e&s;s my&s;elf his well-wi&s;her. May he di&s;cover new tribes of Beetles, Pi&s;|
<PB N="212" REF="220">mires, and Tumbledungs! May the Fungus, the Ragweed, and the Toad|&s;tool develop to him all their latent beauties, and flouri&s;h in the paths before him! May the Dunghills of FRANCE conceal nothing from his botanical re&s;earches; and in the arms of his favourite Madame TERROTGNE may he beget a little race of Natu|rali&s;ts and Homicides to cheri&s;h the in&s;ect tribes of the earth, and to de|populate the human &s;pecies!</P>
<P>I HAVE made it a rule in this work to touch but lightly upon events which have been detailed in our own New&s;papers, or in the Gazettes of other Nations; for which rea&s;on I have not dwelt upon our military
<PB N="213" REF="221">operations, or the progre&s;s of our arms. What looked mo&s;t like order and &s;y&s;tem in our Campaigns was, that we left the &s;laughter of our pri|vate men to the enemy, and took upon our&s;elves the killing our Gene|rals. For about every thou&s;and de|&s;troyed in the field, we cut off the heads of about a dozen Commanders on the &s;caffold; and this proportion has been all along ob&s;erved pretty exactly. Fortune has changed her a&s;pect towards us &s;ince Citizen DUMOURIER be&s;poke his &s;upper at AMSTERDAM in January la&s;t, and GREAT BRITAIN was to be frater|nized the February following. Three &s;trong frontier towns, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, put our people &s;o much
<PB N="214" REF="222">out of humour, that we were obliged to order a number of executions, to re&s;tore the Capital to its u&s;ual gaiety. FRANCE is in a con&s;tant pleuri&s;y, and the only medicament to keep her healthy, is to let out her blood co|piou&s;ly.</P>
<P>BUT a dome&s;tic occurrence about this time entirely diverted the public attention from fleets and armies, and all apprehen&s;ions of foreign in|va&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE death of MARAT, the amiable MARAT that friend to the extirpa|tion of his countrymen, was an event entirely unexpected. His power and
<PB N="215" REF="223">popularity were in their meridian when his Country lo&s;t him.</P>
<P>ON the 13th of June 1793, he fell, <HI>purpureus veluti cum flos,</HI> by the po|niard of CHARLOTTE CORDE, a Female Fanatic, who &s;ufered for it upon a &s;caffold with all the re&s;olu|tion of a Chri&s;tian Martyr. Blood|thir&s;ty Woman! O deed for ever to be dete&s;ted! O name for ever exe|crable! Smiles were all her repen|tance, and to meet death with firm|ne&s;s her contrition. She called him Mon&s;ter too, and having delivered the world from him, re&s;igned her breath with indifference. Mi&s;taken Enthu&s;ia&s;t! FRANCE has millions of &s;uch Mon&s;ters. Thunder may cru&s;h,
<PB N="216" REF="224">the earth may gape and &s;wallow us, but we laugh to think of human means for our extinction. Thy Fel|low-Citizens, my dear, my mur|dering, and murdered Friend! did not forget thee. More than the Pagan honours of the Pantheon were decreed to thee; thou wa&s;t deified, they made thee a God, and gave thee the <HI>pas</HI> to the &s;uppo&s;ed Saviour of the world. Let not thy &s;pirit complain, my PYLADES! though it &s;hould hereafter be con&s;igned to the Devil, for thy confederates on earth exalted thy remains above the Devil's Ma&s;ter. ROBESPIERRE turned pale at thy exit, yet with the u&s;ual fervour of his friend&s;hip, voted thee a whole heca|tomb of human victims to appea&s;e thy
<PB N="217" REF="225">manes. TOM PAINE &s;kulked, and has ever &s;ince hid him&s;el&s; in a quarry|hole, where ravens mini&s;ter to him. There he trembles at the upli&s;ted vi&s;ionary dagger which his eloquence has &s;o often pointed again&s;t the bo|&s;om of Kings and Tyrants.</P>
<P>VIVIT <HI>po&s;t funera virtus.</HI> Even the carca&s;e of my PYLADES retained &s;ome of his living virtues. The&s;e eyes beheld the boy, the little &s;mil|ing Cherub who &s;u&s;tained the civic wreath over thy deified temples, &s;ink down and expire by the &s;tench which i&s;&s;ued from thy leprous anatomy. Thou wa&s;t a mankiller and a wo|mankiller when alive, and thou did&s;t kill a child, after the dagger of
<PB N="218" REF="226">CHARLOTTE had killed thee. Fare|wel, Epitome of thy Countrymen! Adieu, mo&s;t admirable of all Re|formers! I can no more; let my tears &s;peak the re&s;t for me.</P>
<P>THE premature end of this great man &s;pread a con&s;iderable alarm among us: when one deer is &s;truck, the whole herd begin to prick up their ears, and to look about them. ROBESPIERRE'S terrors, who was known to be a coward, would not have been regarded; he went about muttering, <Q>If MARAT will not &s;a|tisfy them, where can virtue be &s;ecure? Lord! Lord! the Devil pre&s;erve me! my turn will be next.</Q> We laughed at this, but
<PB N="219" REF="227">DANTON, THURIOT, MERLIN, and others of a different &s;tamp, could not di&s;gui&s;e their unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time anonymous letters, threatening me with &s;ome invi&s;ible danger, were left for ever at my door, or &s;craps of paper were &s;trewed before me in my hou&s;e; &s;o that I could not avoid &s;eeing them, without my being able to di&s;cover how they had been depo&s;ited. In a legible hand were written words like the&s;e&mdash; <Q>Thy hour is come</Q>&mdash; <Q>Murderers meet with no pardon</Q>&mdash; <Q>Thou ha&s;t &s;hed man's blood, by man &s;hall thy blood be &s;hed</Q>&mdash; <Q>De&s;pair and death are round thee</Q>&mdash; <Q>Re|member MARAT;</Q>&mdash;and many
<PB N="220" REF="228">more admonitions were given me with the &s;ame tremendous brevity. Several fell as victims to my &s;u&s;pi|cions, but the menaces &s;till continued.</P>
<P>WHETHER it proceeded from the di&s;turbance of my waking thoughts, or whether my daemon warned me, I know not, but as I lay one night in bed, neither a&s;leep nor quite awake, the following dreadful vi&s;ion appeared before me. Methought I was placed between MARAT and the Nephew of DAMIEN in the Revolutionary Tribunal. We &s;at up to our knees in blood, the walls of the Court were con&s;tructed with human &s;kulls, ranged in exact order, and kept toge|ther without any cement. From the
<PB N="221" REF="229">&s;ockets of the eyes i&s;&s;ued red flames in the &s;hape of darts and &s;corpions, and all pointed towards me and my companions. The ceiling rained down thick &s;howers of different-co|loured fire, which fell upon and burned us to the bone, without de|&s;troying us. Our ears were then deafened by the mo&s;t terrible &s;hrieks and ince&s;&s;ant claps of thunder, when &s;uddenly a thou&s;and &s;hadows, all in bright raiment, pa&s;&s;ed before us, and each was followed by the earthly form it had worn, as defaced and mangled by our cruelty; while a youthful Angel, with cele&s;tial &s;orrow in his a&s;pect, held a branch of golden palm &s;u&s;pended over them. The figure of the murdered King was
<PB N="222" REF="230">con&s;picuous. His head &s;eemed to be encircled with crowns and &s;tars of the mo&s;t dazzling radiance, &s;o that my wretched eyes were quite blinded with the &s;plendor. He pointed to the &s;ky, and vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>ROCHEFOUCAULT, CLERMONT DE TONNERRE, LA PORTE, Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops without number, and Madame LAMBALLE, followed in the vi&s;ionary proce&s;&s;ion. But O! what words can paint, what imagination can conceive my agonies when the glorified &s;hades of old BERTRAND and his beautiful Daughter glided by before me! I looked about for my companions, and found their bodies con&s;umed to a cinder, with a livid flame ri&s;ing like a &s;mall
<PB N="223" REF="231">pyramid from the &s;pot they had oc|cupied. Not only the bed I to&s;&s;ed on, but the whole chamber &s;hook with the violence of my agitations; I yelled out loud, and tried in vain, with both my hands before my eyes, to exclude the terrifying phantoms. Such is the power of imagination, the &s;cene &s;eemed to la&s;t for fifty years, and my horrors to increa&s;e with its continuance.</P>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of all, the image of my Mother appeared twice before me. The fir&s;t or &s;econd time, methought no fragrance filled the chamber; her countenance was not irradiated; &s;he wore her u&s;ual habit; her hair un|combed, her garments tattered, and
<PB N="224" REF="232">her <HI>&s;abots</HI> foul from the Fi&s;h-market. She held an oy&s;ter half-open in one hand, and in the other the knife with which &s;he opened it. Thrice &s;he &s;hook the honours of her matted tre&s;&s;es, looked mournfully at me, and vani&s;hed from my embrace in a &s;igh &s;trongly impregnated with brandy. The &s;econd time her garb was the &s;ame, but her a&s;pect different. She frowned upon me, and rai&s;ing her knife to my throat, cried out in a &s;hrill tone, which &s;till vibrates on my ear, <Q>Fly, ra&s;h Boy, or &s;tay and peri&s;h!</Q> Human nature could &s;u&s;tain no more. The morning &s;un at length kindly di&s;pelled my vi&s;ion, and my terrors; I crawled from bed in a &s;tate of feeblene&s;s and decrepi|tude
<PB N="225" REF="233">which made me at fir&s;t imagine my torments had really la&s;ted for half a century.</P>
<P>THERE is grent difference between fortitude and fool-hardine&s;s. It &s;eemed better in my eyes to be alive like a man, than to have my breath|le&s;s carrion deified like MARAT'S by a vote of the CONVENTION, &s;o I re|&s;olved to find immediately &s;ome &s;afe a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>WITHOUT communicating my in|tended flight to any living creature, I packed up all my plunder, jewels, and gold, to an incredible value, and in the dead of night &s;et off for MARSEILLES, intending to &s;ail from
<PB N="226" REF="234">thence into ASIA MINOR. But even in the&s;e la&s;t moments I did not for|get my duty to my Country. As the good CATO, after he had re&s;olved on &s;uicide, took care to make the be&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition for his friends at UTICA, &s;o I left a letter for the Nephew of DAMIEN to be delivered after my de|parture, full of advice for the public welfare. I recommended the &s;eparation of the Queen from her Children, thus to tear a&s;under the la&s;t heart-&s;tring which could attach her to exi&s;tence, to deliver her over to the Revolu|tionary Tribunal, and to confine her in the <HI>Conciergerie,</HI> one of the mo&s;t loath &s;ome of our numerous pri&s;ons; and to dig up the bones and a&s;hes of the dead at <HI>St. Denys,</HI> to prove that nothing
<PB N="227" REF="235">above or under ground could be &s;a|cred from our fury. While I waited <HI>incognito</HI> for a ve&s;&s;el at MARSEILLES, I had the plea&s;ure to hear that all this was carried into execution. Not long afterwards, with a light heart, and a favourable wind, I &s;et &s;ail, and arrived &s;afely at SMYRNA.</P>
<P>EVERY thing in TURKEY, as in FRANCE, is venal. In le&s;s than a week I purcha&s;ed the po&s;t of a Cadi which happened to be vacant, and by the virtue of circumci&s;ion became a Mahometan. I would willingly have di&s;pen&s;ed with that di&s;agreeable rite, but the Turks threatened to impale me, &s;o I &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="236">THE Reader may now view me without my fore&s;kin, and my head overwhelmed in a turban. My office &s;ecures to me the gratification of two predominant appetites, the love of money, and the love of women. Exalted on my tribunal, I di&s;pen&s;e inju&s;tice to the world around me, and am as formidable to innocence in my capacity of a Judge, as I was to my Country in that of a Reformer. How admirable is it to &s;ee me deciding cau&s;es without hearing a word of the pleadings, and commonly without knowing even the names of the parties! My faithful Secretary XANTHIUS, a Greek, &s;aves me much trouble by whi&s;pering in my ear, <Q>One is rich,
<PB N="229" REF="237">and the other poor: Poverty has nothing to do with litigation.</Q></P>
<P>THE fame of my &s;ummary deci&s;ions is diffu&s;ed &s;o widely, that the parties in general &s;ay not a word, but after the pro&s;trations due to my dignity, lay their pur&s;es down before me. I put both in my pocket, and always decide in favour of the heavie&s;t; thus it may be &s;een I e&s;timate Ju&s;tice by the weight, as &s;ome people do &s;ilk &s;tock|ings, or Engli&s;h Sailors &s;ilver watches.</P>
<P>YET, notwith&s;tanding all my power, and the full enjoyment of every A&s;iatic Luxury, I often ca&s;t my eyes with regret towards my dear native Country.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="238">WHAT fate may await her I cannot pretend to fore&s;ee. Whether &s;he will over-run EUROPE, or is on the eve of her di&s;memberment, may furni&s;h abundant matter of &s;peculation to Coffee-Hou&s;e Politicians, and the Writers of Pamphlets. Her actual condition is too well known to admit of any di&s;gui&s;e, except in New&s;|papers, or the repre&s;entations of the CONVENTION.</P>
<P>To &s;ubdue her entirely is difficult, but to re&s;tore her to any &s;tate of tran|quillity and order much more &s;o. What human indu&s;try had rai&s;ed, human indu&s;try may demoli&s;h, and erect in its place &s;omething perhaps more noble and per&s;ect; but the mind
<PB N="231" REF="239">of FRANCE is overturned, her prin|ciples are rooted out, and her rea&s;on lies buried; the pre&s;ent generation cannot live to &s;ee that re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>WHETHER AUSTRIA will re&s;t &s;a|tisfied with the recovery of LORRAIN and ALSACE; whether PRUSSIA will compound for money, or the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a di&s;trict; whether ENGLAND will be content to occupy our har|bours, and to annihilate our navy; are events repo&s;ing perhaps in the womb of futurity. De&s;peration is our goad, nor are our internal enemies le&s;s de&s;perate. Pri&s;oners on both &s;ides mu&s;t peri&s;h by the executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="240">OUR great conte&s;t at home is now between Republicani&s;m and Demo|cracy, or between the Tyranny of many, and the Madne&s;s of all, for the Royal Cau&s;e in FRANCE has but un|lucky &s;upporters; yet there is cer|tainly but one remedy for all her calamities, and that (having now no further intere&s;t in their continuance) I he&s;itate not to declare, can only be found in THE RESTORATION OF ROYALTY.</P>
