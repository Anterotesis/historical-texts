<P>IN the Year 1771 happening to fall into company in which the &s;ubject of the <HI>Patagonians</HI> was mentioned, &s;everal opi|nions aro&s;e, &s;ome &s;avoring of &s;ceptici&s;m: others gave full credit to the accounts lately published.

He was at that time at <HI>Spetchley</HI> near <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> I immediately procured recommendation to the worthy owner <HI>Robert Berkely</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> from whom I met with every politene&s;s. I then commenced with him a friend&s;hip which ever &s;ince has given me &s;ingular plea&s;ure. I found Father <HI>Falkener</HI> to be a man of about &s;eventy Years of age, active in mind and body, <HI>Bru&s;que</HI> in his manners, having never &s;haken off tho&s;e he had acquired in his thirty eight Years re&s;idence among the Savages. He very freely communicated to me every thing he knew re&s;pecting tho&s;e People. He informed me al&s;o that he was born at <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> that about the Year 1731 he was a Surgeon in the <HI>A&s;&s;iento</HI> Ship, and in that Year became at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> a convert to Popery; and in due time of the &s;ociety of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and was &s;ent on the mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Paraquay.</HI>
This little piece would never have &s;een the light but for the friend&s;hip of Mr. ALLAN; and let the few to whom this may give plea&s;ure, unite in thanks to that liberal Gentleman, with</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW execute the promi&s;e I made in Town &s;ome time ago, of communicating to you the re&s;ult of my vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> an antient Je&s;uit who had pa&s;&s;ed thirty eight Years of his life in the South|ern part of South <HI>America</HI> between the River <HI>la Plata</HI> and the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> Let me endeavour to prejudice you in favor of my new Friend, by a&s;&s;uring you, that by his long intercour&s;e with the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> he &s;eems to have lo&s;t all <HI>European</HI> guile, and to have acquired all the &s;implicity and hone&s;t impetuo&s;ity of the people he has been &s;o long conver&s;ant with. I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of; which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as he was eye witne&s;s to, and &s;uch as will (I believe) e&s;tabli&s;h pa&s;t contradiction the veracity of our late Circumnavigators and give new lights into the manners of this &s;ingular race of Men: It will not I flatter my&s;elf be deemed impertinent to lay before you a Chronological Mention of the &s;everal evidences that will tend to prove the exi&s;tence of a People of a &s;upernatural height inhabiting the Southern Tract. You will find, that the majority of Voyagers who have touched on that Coa&s;t have &s;een them, and made reports of their &s;ize that will very well keep in coun|tenance the verbal account given by Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and the printed by Mr. <HI>Clarke;</HI> you will ob&s;erve, that if the old Voyagers did exaggerate, it was thro' the novelty and amazement at &s;o &s;ingular a &s;ight; but the latter forewarn'd by the preceding accounts, &s;eem to have made their remarks with coolne&s;s, and confirmed them by the experiment of mea&s;urement.</P>

<P>I dwell the longer on this account, as it appears extremely de&s;erving of credit; as the courage of <HI>Magellan</HI> made him incapable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of fear: nor could there be any mi&s;take about the height; as he had not only a long intercour&s;e with them, but the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two, for a very con&s;iderable &s;pace of time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Ram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ias</HI> Coll.

Tran&s;actions for 1767 p. 75. Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> was Officer in Mr. <HI>Byrons</HI> &s;hip, landed with him in the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and had for two hours an opportunity of &s;tanding within a few yards of this race, and &s;eeing them examined and mea&s;ured by Mr. <HI>Byron.</HI> He repre&s;ents them in general as &s;tout and well proportion'd, and a&s;&s;ures us, that none of the Men were lower than eight feet, and that &s;ome even exceeded nine; and that the Women were from &s;even feet and an half to eight feet, he law Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> mea&s;ure one of the Men, and notwith&s;tanding the Commodore was near &s;ix feet high, he could when on tip toe, but ju&s;t reach with his hand the top of the <HI>Patagonian's</HI> head; and Mr, <HI>Clarke</HI> is certain, that there were &s;everal taller than him on whom the experiment was made, for there was about five hundred Men Women and Children. They &s;eem'd very happy at the landing of our people, and expre&s;&s;ed their joy by a rude &s;ort of &s;inging. They were of a copper color, and had long lank hair, and faces hideou&s;ly painted; both &s;exes were cover'd with &s;kins, and &s;ome appeared on hor&s;eback and others on foot.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Premontel</HI> makes this an object of ridicule, as if the &s;ize of the hor&s;es were unequal to the burden of the riders. Our Navigators tell us, that the hor&s;es were fifteen or &s;ixteen feet high. It is well known, that a Mill-hor&s;e has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds, a weight probably beyond that of any <HI>Patagonian</HI> they &s;aw.</P>
<P>A few had on their legs a &s;ort of boot with a &s;harp pointed &s;tick at the heel in&s;tead of a &s;pur. Their bridles were made of thong, the bit wood; the &s;addle as artle&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, and without &s;tirrups. The intro|duction of hor&s;es into the&s;e parts by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> introduced likewi&s;e the only &s;pecies of manufacture they appear to be acquainted with. All their &s;kill &s;eems to extend no further than the&s;e rude e&s;&s;ays at a har|ne&s;s; and to equip them&s;elves for <HI>Cavaliers.</HI> In other re&s;pects they would be in the &s;ame &s;tate as our fir&s;t parents ju&s;t turned out of para|di&s;e, cloathed in coats of &s;kins; or at be&s;t in the &s;ame condition in which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> found the ancient <HI>Britons;</HI> for their dre&s;s was &s;imilar, their hair long, and their bodies like tho&s;e of our Ance&s;tors made terrific by wild painting. The&s;e people by &s;ome means or other had acquired a few beads and bracelets; otherwi&s;e not a &s;ingle article of <HI>European</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
fabric appeared among them. The&s;e they mu&s;t have gotten by the intercour&s;e with the other <HI>Indian</HI> tribes: for had they had any inter|cour&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they never would have neglected procuring knives, the &s;tirrups, and other conveniences which the people &s;een by Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI> had.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been glad to have clo&s;ed in this place the&s;e relations of this &s;tupendous race of Mankind; becau&s;e the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities &s;eem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced, or at left &s;erve to give &s;coffers room to &s;ay, that the preceding Navigators had &s;een the&s;e people thro' the medium of magnifying gla&s;&s;es in&s;tead of the &s;ober eye of ob&s;ervation: but before I make my remarks on what has been before related, I &s;hall proceed with the other Navigators, and then attempt to reconcile the different accounts. In 1767 Captain <HI>Wallis</HI> of the <HI>Dolphin</HI> and Captain <HI>Philip Carteret</HI> of the <HI>Swallow</HI> Sloop &s;aw and mea&s;ured with a pole &s;eve|ral of the <HI>Patagonians</HI> who happen'd to be in the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan</HI> during his pa&s;&s;age,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

That their arms were &s;lings formed of two round balls, fa&s;ten'd one to each end of a cord, which they fling with great force and dexterity, He adds they hold one ball in their hand and &s;wing the other at the full length of the cord round their head by which it acquires a prodigious velocity: they will fling it to a great di&s;tance, and with &s;uch exactne&s;s, as to &s;trike a very &s;mall object; the&s;e people were al&s;o mounted on Hor&s;es, their faddles bridles &amp;c. were of their own making; &s;ome had iron and others metal bits to their bridles, and one had a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> broad &s;word; but whether the la&s;t articles were taken by war or procured by commerce is uncertain, but the la&s;t is mo&s;t probable. It &s;eems evident that they had intercour&s;e with <HI>Europeans,</HI> and had even adopted &s;ome of their fa&s;hions, for many had cut their dre&s;s into form of <HI>Spani&s;h Punches,</HI> or a &s;quare piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head, the re&s;t hanging

<P>I am &s;orry to be obliged to remark in the&s;e voyages a very illibral propen&s;ity to cavil at, and invalidate the account given by Mr. <HI>Byron:</HI> but at the &s;ame time exult in having an opportunity given me by that Gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor. <HI>M. Bougainville</HI> in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> con|ver&s;ed with, a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;aw numbers of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of knives of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manufactory, certainly given them by Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> but he &s;hould have con&s;idered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing, that the commerce between <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>South America</HI> through the port of <HI>Cadiz</HI> is mo&s;t uncommonly large; and that his <HI>Indians</HI> might have got their knives from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at the &s;ame time that they got their gilt nails and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> harne&s;s: but for farther &s;atisfac|tion on this &s;ubject, I have liberty to &s;ay from Mr. <HI>Byron's</HI> authority, that he never gave a &s;ingle knife to the people he &s;aw, that he had not one at that time about him, that excepting the pre&s;ents given with his own hands, and the tobacco brought by Lieutenant <HI>Cummins,</HI> not the lea&s;t trifle was be&s;towed. I am furni&s;hed with one other proof, that the&s;e le&s;&s;er <HI>Indians</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI> &s;aw were not the &s;ame with tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> as has been in&s;inuated: for the fir&s;t had with him &s;ome officers who had been with him on the preceding Voyage, and who bear witne&s;s not only to the difference of &s;ize, but declare that the&s;e people had not a &s;ingle article among them given by Mr. <HI>Byron</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Byrons</HI> letter at the end.</NOTE>.

W. of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> and extends near a thou&s;and miles towards the <HI>Andes.</HI> In the&s;e plains he fir&s;t met with &s;ome tribes of the&s;e people and was taken under the protection of one of the <HI>Caciques.</HI> The remarks he made on their &s;ize were as follows; that the talle&s;t which he mea&s;ured in the &s;ame manner that Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> did, was &s;even feet eight inches high, that the common height or middle &s;ize was &s;ix feet, that there were numbers that were even &s;horter, and that the tall|e&s;t Women did not exceed &s;ix feet. That they were &s;cattered from the foot of the <HI>Andes,</HI> over that va&s;t tract which extends to the <HI>Atlantic Ocean</HI> and are found as far as the <HI>red river</HI> at Bay <HI>Anagada</HI> lat. 40. 1; below that the land is too barren to be habitable and none are found except accidental migrants till you arrive at the river <HI>Gallego</HI> near the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI></P>
<P>They are &s;uppo&s;ed to be a race derived from the <HI>Chilian Indians,</HI> the <HI>Puelches</HI> who inhabited the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Andes,</HI> the &s;ame brave nation who defeated and de&s;troyed the avaritious <HI>Spaniard Baldivia</HI> but after that were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their &s;eat.</P>
<P>They dwell in large tents covered with the hides of Mares and di|vided within into Apartments for the different ranks of the Family, by a &s;ort of blanketting. They are a mo&s;t migratory people and often &s;hift their quarters; when the Women &s;trike the tents a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting them on their hor&s;es and like the females of all &s;avage countries under|go all the laborious work.</P>
<P>They have two motives for &s;hifting their quarters, one for the &s;ake of getting &s;alt which they find incru&s;ted in the &s;hallow pools near the &s;ea &s;ide.</P>
<P>The other inducement is the &s;uper&s;tition they have of burying their dead within a certain di&s;tance of the ocean, and I may certainly add a third, that of the nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t lie under of &s;eeking fre&s;h quarters on account of the chace which is their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">Tho&s;e who deny the exi&s;tence of the&s;e great People never con&s;ider the migratory nature of the Inhabitants of this prodigious tract, and never reflect that the tribes who may have been &s;een this month on the coa&s;t, may the next be &s;ome hundreds of miles inland and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different. The&s;e Gentlemen &s;eem to lay down as a certain po&s;ition, that <HI>Patagonia</HI> is peopled by only a &s;ingle nation, and from that fal&s;e principle they draw their arguments, &s;neer in&s;ult and even gro&s;sly abu&s;e all that differ in opinion. Among the mo&s;t illiberal of the&s;e writers is <HI>M. de Premontel,</HI> who with the rapid inge|nuity of his country mounts on his head &s;trong cour&s;er PREJUDICE, &s;ets off full &s;peed, rides over all the hone&s;t fellows that would inform him of his road, and &s;purns even truth her&s;elf tho' &s;he offers to be his guide: but truth is unadorned and hated by this fanta&s;tic writer, would &s;poil him of all the flowers of fiction, and tropes of abu&s;e again&s;t a rival country, would teach him facts that would ruin his argument and re|duce his eloquent memoire to a &s;ingle narrative of unconte&s;ted veracity.</P>
<P>Their food is (almo&s;t entirely) animal: the fle&s;h of Hor&s;es, Oxen, Guanacoes and O&s;triches, all of which they eat roa&s;ted or boiled. Their drink is water except in the &s;ea&s;on when certain &s;pecies of Fruit are ripe, for of tho&s;e they make a &s;ort of fermenting Liquor called <HI>Chucha</HI> common to many parts of South America. One kind is made of a podd|ed fruit called <HI>Algarrova</HI> which &s;mells like a bug, and when brui&s;ed in Water becomes an inebriating Liquor. The &s;ame fruit is al&s;o eaten as bread. The other <HI>Chucha</HI> is made of the <HI>Molic</HI> a &s;mall fruit, hot and &s;weet in the Mouth, both the&s;e cau&s;e a deep drunkenne&s;s, e&s;pecially the la&s;t which excites a phrenetic inebriation and a wildne&s;s of Eyes, which la&s;ts, two or three Days.</P>

They wear a &s;hort apron before, which is tucked between the Legs and pre|&s;erves a mode&s;t appearance. They never wear feather'd ornaments, ex|cept

in their Dances. Their Hair is long and tied up with a fillet. They have naturally Beards,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>M. Premontel</HI> roundly a&s;&s;erts that they have no beards.</NOTE> but they generally pluck up the Hairs; not but &s;ome leave Mu&s;taches, as was ob&s;erv'd by Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> and <HI>M. Bou|gainville.</HI></P>
<P>When they go to War they wear a fourfold Coat of the Skin of the <HI>Tapier,</HI> a Cap of Bull's hide doubled, and a broad Target of the &s;ame. Their offen&s;ive Weapons are Bows and Arrows, the la&s;t headed with bone, launces headed with Iron and broad &s;words, both which they procure from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but their native Weapons are Slings, of the&s;e they have two kinds, one for War which con&s;i&s;ts of a thong, headed with Stone, at only one end; and during their Campaigns they carry numbers of the&s;e wraped about their bodies.</P>
<P>The Slings which they u&s;e in the chace of Hor&s;es, Cattle or O&s;triches have a Stone fixed to each end; and &s;ometimes another thong with a third Stone is fa&s;ten'd to the middle of the other: the&s;e with amazing dexterity, they fling round the objects of the chace be they Bea&s;ts or O&s;triches which entangle them &s;o that they cannot &s;tir. The Indians leave them I may &s;ay thus tied neck and heels, and go on in pur&s;uit of fre&s;h Game; and having fini&s;h'd their &s;port return to pick up the Animals they left &s;ecur'd in the &s;lings.</P>
<P>Their Wars are chiefly with the other <HI>Indians,</HI> for <HI>Patagonia</HI> is inha|bited by variety of People, not a &s;ingle nation. They have a great deal of intercour&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and often come down to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>
to trade for Iron, Bugles &amp;c.</P>
<P>This commerce with the <HI>Europeans</HI> has corrupted them greatly, taught them the vice of dram-drinking and been a dreadful ob&s;tacle to their moral improvement. Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> inform'd me, that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction, but that they grew unruly and ungovernable as &s;oon as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Traders got among them.</P>
<P>Their War and their chace are carried on Hor&s;eback, for they are mo&s;t expert riders and have multitudes of Hor&s;es with which the Country is perfectly over-run for they go in herds of thou&s;ands. The price of a Hor&s;e at pre&s;ent is two Dollars or 9<HI>s.</HI> and 2<HI>d.</HI> provided it has been

<P>They have Prie&s;ts and Prie&s;te&s;&s;es, who&s;e office is to mediate with the&s;e Beings in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s or any di&s;tre&s;s; by the intervention of the Prie&s;t they are con&s;ulted about future events; at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons the Prie&s;t &s;huts him&s;elf up and falls into a phrenetic extacy <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The pretenders to &s;econd &s;ight in the <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rides</HI> and the <HI>Awenyddion</HI> or the <HI>In&s;pired</HI> among the <HI>Welch</HI> are &s;eized with the &s;ame exta&s;ie</NOTE> and appears epilep|tic.

<P>If a <HI>Cazique</HI> dies or any public calamity happens; for example in particular when the &s;mall pox had made great ravages among the Tribes, the Prie&s;ts are &s;ure to &s;uffer, for the misfortune is pre&s;umed to have happened thro' their neglect in not deprecating the evil, in the&s;e ca&s;es they have no other method of &s;aving them&s;elves, but by lay|ing the blame on others of their Brethren.</P>
<P>Prie&s;ts are cho&s;en from among the young People the mo&s;t effeminate they can find, but tho&s;e that are epileptic have always the preference, and the&s;e dre&s;s in a female habit.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">The <HI>Puelches</HI> have a notion of a future &s;tate, and imagine that after death they are to be tran&s;ported to a Country, where the fruits of inebriation are eternal, there to live in immortal drunkenne&s;s, and the perpetual chace of the O&s;trich.</P>
<P>When a Per&s;on of eminence dies, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Women in the place goes into the Tent, clears the Body of all the inte&s;tines, and &s;crapes off as much of the fle&s;h from the bones as po&s;&s;ible, and then burns very carefully both that and the entrails; when that is done, the bones are buried till the re&s;t of the fle&s;h is quite decay'd: they are taken up with|in a year; and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are re|fixed and tied together, and the whole form'd into a perfect &s;keleton. Thus complete, it is packed up in a hide, put on the back of a favorite Hor&s;e of the decea&s;ed, and then tran&s;lated to the Tomb of his Ance&s;|tor, perhaps 300 miles di&s;tant and always within a &s;mall &s;pace from the Sea.</P>
<P>The &s;keleton is then taken out and deck'd in its be&s;t Robes, and adorn'd with plumes and beads, is placed &s;iting in a deep &s;quare pit parallel with tho&s;e buried before, with Sword Launce and other Wea|pons placed by them, and the &s;kins of their Hor&s;es &s;tuff'd and &s;upported by &s;takes al&s;o accompany them.

<P>From the preceding account it appears that the country which goes un|der the name of <HI>Patagonia</HI> extending from the River <HI>la Plata</HI> Lat. 35. to the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan</HI> Lat. 53 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>M. de Premontal</HI> will compare <HI>Patagonia</HI> to the &s;pace between the <HI>Riviere des Sardines</HI> and the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan.</HI></NOTE> and we&s;tward as far as the <HI>Andes,</HI> is inhabited by Men who may be divided into three different Cla&s;&s;es, and to them may be added a fourth a combination or mixture of others.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a race of Men of common &s;ize, who have been &s;een by numbers and who&s;e exi&s;tence is indi&s;putable. The&s;e often are &s;een on the northern &s;ide of the &s;treights of <HI>Magellan</HI> and oftner on the <HI>Terra del Fuego</HI> &s;ide even as low as oppo&s;ite to <HI>Cape Horn.</HI> The&s;e are frequently an exiled race, unhappy fugitives drove by their enemies, to take &s;helter from their fury, in tho&s;e di&s;tant parts; for &s;uch is the information Mr. <HI>Falkener</HI> received from &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> he met with in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> and this will account for the &s;ettled melancholy of the People ob&s;erved by the Navigators in <HI>Terra del Fuego.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who (in general) exceed the com|mon height of <HI>Europeans</HI> by a few inches or perhaps the head; &s;uch were tho&s;e who were &s;een by <HI>John Moore</HI> who &s;ail'd with <HI>Gracias de Nodal</HI> in 1618; by Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> in 1767, and by <HI>M. Bougainville</HI> in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">The third Cla&s;s is compo&s;'d of tho&s;e who&s;e height is &s;o extraordi|nary as to occa&s;ion &s;o great a di&s;belief, of the accounts of Voyagers; and yet they are indi&s;putable an exi&s;tent People, they have been &s;een by <HI>Magellan</HI> and &s;ix other in the 16th. Century and by two if not three in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The fourth Cla&s;s is a mixed race, who carele&s;s about pre&s;erving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate, have degraded them&s;elves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country, and from that intercour&s;e have produced a mongrel breed of every &s;ize, except that of the original &s;tandard, &s;ome few, as if by accident, &s;eem to a&s;pire to the height of their ance&s;tors, but are checked in their growth, and &s;top at the &s;tature of &s;even feet eight inches, &s;carce the middle &s;ize of the genuine breed. But another rea&s;on maybe a&s;&s;igned for the degene|racy and inequality of &s;ize in this Cla&s;s: they live within the neighbor|hood of <HI>Europeans,</HI> they have intercour&s;e with them, and from them they have acquired the vice of dram drinking and all its horrible con|&s;equences; this alone is &s;ufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies.</P>
<P>A third rea&s;on may &s;till be a&s;&s;igned <HI>viz.</HI> The introduction of manu|facturies among them. Tho&s;e people who depended on the &s;poils of the cha&s;e for their habiliments were certain of pre&s;erving their full vigor, their &s;trength of con&s;titution and fullne&s;s of habit, while tho&s;e who are confin'd to the loom grow enervate and lo&s;e much of the force of their bodily faculties. They al&s;o live in tents lin'd with woollen manu|facture, which doubtle&s;sly are much more delicate, luxurious and warm than the dwellings of the third undegenerate Cla&s;s. We are unacquaint|ed with the form of their tents, but we know that they &s;till cloath them&s;elves with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and that among tho&s;e, Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> &s;aw there was not the le&s;t appearance of manufactury excepting what related to their hor&s;e furniture.
