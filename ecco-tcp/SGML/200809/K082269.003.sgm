<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A ROUT.</HEAD>
<P>THE day at length arrived of which the evening and the entrance of com|pany were, for the fir&s;t time, as eagerly wi&s;hed by Cecilia as by her di&s;&s;i|pated ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s. No expence and no pains had been &s;pared to render this long projected entertainment &s;plendid and ele|gant; it was to begin with a concert, which was to be followed by a ball, and &s;ucceeded by a &s;upper.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though unu&s;ually anxious about her own affairs, was not &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by them as to behold with indifference a &s;cene of &s;uch unju&s;tifiable extravagance; it con|tributed to render her thoughtful and unea&s;y,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
and to deprive her of all mental power of participating in the gaiety of the a&s;&s;embly. Mr. Arnott was yet more deeply affected by the mad folly of the &s;cheme, and re|ceived from the whole evening no other &s;a|tisfaction than that which a look of &s;ympa|thetic concern from Cecilia occa&s;ionally af|forded him.</P>
<P>Till nine o'clock no company appeared, except Sir Robert Floyer, who &s;tayed from dinner time, and Mr. Morrice, who having received an invitation for the evening, was &s;o much delighted with the permi&s;&s;ion to again enter the hou&s;e, that he made u&s;e of it between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock, and before the family had left the dining parlour. He apologized with the utmo&s;t humility to Ce|cilia for the unfortunate accident at the Pantheon; but as to her it had been pro|ductive of nothing but plea&s;ure, by exciting in young Delvile the mo&s;t flattering alarm for her &s;afety, &s;he found no great difficulty in according him her pardon.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who came in the fir&s;t crowd was Mr. Monckton, who, had he been equally uncon&s;cious of &s;ini&s;ter views, would in following his own inclination, have been as early in his attendance as Mr. Morrice; but who, to obviate all &s;u&s;picious remarks, conformed to the fa&s;hionable tardine&s;s of the times.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
Cecilia's chief apprehen&s;ion for the even|ing was that Sir Robert Floyer would a&s;k her to dance with him, which &s;he could not refu&s;e without &s;itting &s;till during the ball, nor accept, after the reports &s;he knew to be &s;pread, without &s;eeming to give a public &s;anction to them. To Mr. Monckton therefore, innocently con&s;idering him as a married man and her old friend, &s;he frank|ly told her di&s;tre&s;s, adding, by way of ex|cu&s;e for the hint, that the partners were to be changed every two dances.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, though his principal &s;tudy was carefully to avoid all public gal|lantry or a&s;&s;iduity towards Cecilia, had not the forbearance to re&s;i&s;t this intimation, and therefore &s;he had the plea&s;ure of telling Sir Robert, when he a&s;ked the honour of her hand for the two fir&s;t dances, that &s;he was already engaged.</P>
<P>She then expected that he would imme|diately &s;ecure her for the two following; but, to her great joy, he was &s;o much piqued by the evident plea&s;ure with which &s;he an|nounced her engagement, that he proudly walked away without adding another word.</P>
<P>Much &s;atisfied with this arrangement, and not without hopes that, if &s;he was at li|berty when he arrived, &s;he might be appli|ed to by young Delvile, &s;he now endea|voured
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to procure her&s;elf a place in the mu&s;ic room.</P>
<P>This, with &s;ome difficulty, &s;he effected; but though there was an excellent concert, in which &s;everal capital performers played and &s;ung, &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to hear a note, as &s;he chanced to be &s;eated ju&s;t by Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, and two other young ladies, who were paying one another compliments upon their dre&s;s and their looks, &s;ettling to dance in the &s;ame cotillon, gue&s;&s;ing who would begin the minuets, and wondering there were not more gentlemen. Yet, in the mid&s;t of this unmeaning conver&s;ation, of which &s;he remarked that Mi&s;s Lee&s;on bore the principal part, not one of them failed, from time to time, to exclaim with great rapture <Q REND="inline">"<HI>What &s;weet mu&s;ic!&mdash;</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Oh how charming!</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Did you ever hear any thing &s;o delightful?&mdash;</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia to Mr. Go&s;port, who now approached her, <Q REND="inline">"but for your ex|planatory ob&s;ervations, how much would the &s;udden loquacity of this <HI>&s;upercilious</HI> lady, whom I had imagined all but dumb, have perplext me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e who are mo&s;t &s;ilent to &s;tran|gers,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"commonly talk mo&s;t fluently to their intimates, for they are deeply in arrears, and eager to pay off their debts. Mi&s;s Lee&s;on now is in her
<PB N="7" REF="6">
proper &s;et, and therefore appears in her natural character: and the poor girl's joy in being able to utter all the nothings &s;he has painfully hoarded while &s;eparated from her coterie, gives to her now the wild tran&s;|port of a bird ju&s;t let loo&s;e from a cage. I rejoice to &s;ee the little creature at liberty, for what can be &s;o melancholy as a forced appearance of thinking, where there are no materials for &s;uch an occupation?"</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, Mi&s;s Larolles, who was laughing immoderately, contrived to crowd her&s;elf into their party, calling out to them, <Q REND="inline">"O you have had the greate&s;t lo&s;s in the world! if you had but been in the next room ju&s;t now!&mdash;there's the drolle&s;t figure there you can conceive: enough to frighten one to look at him."</Q> And pre&s;ently &s;he added <Q REND="inline">"O Lord, if you &s;toop a little this way, you may &s;ee him!"</Q></P>
<P>Then followed a general tittering, accom|panied with exclamations of <Q REND="inline">"Lord, what a fright!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It's enough to kill one with laughing to look at him!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Did you ever &s;ee &s;uch a horrid creature in your life?"</Q> And &s;oon after, one of them &s;creamed out <Q REND="inline">"O Lord, &s;ee!&mdash;he's grinning at Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then turned her head towards the door, and there, to her own as well as her
<PB N="8" REF="7">
neighbours amazement, &s;he perceived Mr. Briggs! who, in order to look about him at his ea&s;e, was &s;tanding upon a chair, from which, having &s;ingled her out, he was re|garding her with a facetious &s;mirk, which, when it caught her eye, was converted into a familiar nod.</P>
<P>She returned his &s;alutation, but was not much charmed to ob&s;erve, that pre&s;ently de&s;cending from his exalted po&s;t, which had moved the wonder and ri&s;ibility of all the company, he made a motion to approach her; for which purpo&s;e, regardle&s;s of either ladies or gentlemen in his way, he &s;turdily pu&s;hed forward, with the &s;ame unconcerned hardine&s;s he would have forced him&s;elf through a crowd in the &s;treet; and taking not the &s;malle&s;t notice of their frowns, &s;up|plications that he would &s;tand &s;till, and ex|clamations of <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir!"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Lord, how trouble&s;ome!"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do a&s;&s;ure you here's no room!"</Q> he fairly and adroitly el|bowed them from him till he reached her &s;eat: and then, with a waggi&s;h grin, he looked round, to &s;hew he had got the bet|ter, and to &s;ee whom he had di&s;compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>When he had enjoyed this triumph, he turned to Cecilia, and chucking her under the chin, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Well, my little duck, how goes it? got to you at la&s;t; &s;queezed my way; would not be nicked; warrant I'll
<PB N="9" REF="8">
mob with the be&s;t of them! Look here! all in a heat!&mdash;hot as the dog-days."</Q></P>
<P>And then, to the utter con&s;ternation of the company, he took off his wig to wipe his head! which occa&s;ioned &s;uch univer&s;al horrour, that all who were near the door e&s;caped into other apartments, while tho&s;e who were too much enclo&s;ed for flight, with one accord turned away their heads.</P>
<P>Captain Are&s;by, being applied to by &s;ome of the ladies to remon&s;trate upon this unexampled behaviour, advanced to him, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am quite <HI>abim&eacute;,</HI> Sir, to incom|mode you, but the commands of the ladies are in&s;uperable. Give me leave, Sir, to en|treat that you would put on your wig."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My wig?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"ay, ay, &s;hall in a moment, only want to wipe my head fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am quite <HI>a&s;&s;omm&eacute;,</HI> Sir,"</Q> returned the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"to di&s;turb you, but I mu&s;t really hint you don't comprehend me: the ladies are extremely inconvenienced by the&s;e &s;ort of &s;ights, and we make it a principle they &s;hould never be <HI>accabl&eacute;es</HI> with them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> cried Mr. Briggs, &s;taring.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ay, Sir,"</Q> replied the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"the ladies are quite <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> that you will not cover your head."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What for?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"what's the matter with my head? ne'er a man here got
<PB N="10" REF="9">
a better! very good &s;tuff in it: won't change it with ne'er a one of you!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, half uncon&s;cious of the offence he had given, and half angry at the rebuke he had received, he lei&s;urely compleated his de&s;ign, and again put on his wig, &s;ettling it to his face with as much compo&s;ure as if he had performed the operation in his own dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>The Captain, having gained his point, walked away, making, however, various grimaces of di&s;gu&s;t, and whi&s;pering from &s;ide to &s;ide <Q REND="inline">"he's the mo&s;t petrifying fel|low I ever was <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> by!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Briggs then, with much deri&s;ion, and &s;undry di&s;tortions of countenance, li&s;tened to an Italian &s;ong; after which, he bu&s;tled back to the outer apartment, in &s;earch of Cecilia, who, a&s;hamed of &s;eeming a party in the di&s;turbance he had excited, had taken the opportunity of his di&s;pute with the Captain, to run into the next room; where, however, he pre&s;ently found her, while &s;he was giving an account to Mr. Go&s;port of her connexion with him, to which Morrice, ever curious and eager to know what was going forward, was al&s;o li&s;tening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, little chick!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"got to you again! &s;oon out-jo&s;tle tho&s;e jemmy &s;parks! But where's the &s;upper? &s;ee no|thing
<PB N="11" REF="10">
of the &s;upper! Time to go to bed,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e there is none; all a take-in; no|thing but a little piping."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Supper, Sir?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"the Concert is not over yet. Was &s;upper men|tioned in your card of invitation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, to be &s;ure, &s;hould not have come el&s;e. Don't vi&s;it often; always co&s;ts mo|ney. Wi&s;h I had not come now; wore a hole in my &s;hoe; hardly a crack in it be|fore."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you did not walk, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did, did; why not? Might as well have &s;tayed away though; daubed my be&s;t coat, like to have &s;poilt it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So much the better for the taylors, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, pertly, <Q REND="inline">"for then you mu&s;t have another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Another! what for? ha'n't had this &s;even years; ju&s;t as good as new."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you had not another fall?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wor&s;e, wor&s;e; like to have lo&s;t my bundle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What bundle, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;t coat and wai&s;tcoat; brought 'em in my handkerchief, purpo&s;e to &s;ave them. When will Ma&s;ter Harrel do as much?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But had you no apprehen&s;ions, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port drily, <Q REND="inline">"that the handker|chief
<PB N="12" REF="11">
would be the &s;ooner worn out for hav|ing a knot tied in it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Took care of that, tied it &s;lack. Met an unlucky boy; little dog gave it a pluck; knot &s;lipt; coat and wai&s;tcoat popt out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what became of the boy, Sir?"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"I hope he got off?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Could not run for laughing; caught him in a minute; gave him &s;omething to laugh for; drubbed him &s;oundly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O poor fellow!"</Q> cried Morrice with a loud hallow, <Q REND="inline">"I am really &s;orry for him. But pray, Sir, what became of your be&s;t coat and wai&s;tcoat while you gave him this drubbing? did you leave them in the dirt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Mr. Nincompoop,"</Q> an&s;wered Briggs angrily, <Q REND="inline">"I put them on a &s;tall."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That was a perilous expedient, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"and I &s;hould fear might be attended with ill con&s;equences, for the owner of the &s;tall would be apt to expect &s;ome little <HI>dou&ccedil;eur.</HI> How did you manage, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bought a halfpenny worth of apples. Serve for &s;upper to-morrow night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how, Sir, did you get your cloaths dried, or cleaned?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Went to an alehou&s;e; co&s;t me half a pint."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, Sir,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"where, at la&s;t, did you make your toilette?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
<Q REND="inline">"Sha'n't tell, &s;ha'n't tell; a&s;k no more que&s;tions. What &s;ignifies where a man &s;lips on a coat and wai&s;tcoat?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, this will prove an expen&s;ive expedition to you,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, very gravely; <Q REND="inline">"Have you ca&s;t up what it may co&s;t you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More than it's worth, more than it's worth,"</Q> an&s;wered he petti&s;hly; <Q REND="inline">"ha'n't laid out &s;o much in plea&s;ure the&s;e five years."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha! ha!"</Q> cried Morrice, hallowing aloud, <Q REND="inline">why it can't be more than &s;ixpence in all!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sixpence?"</Q> repeated he &s;cornfully, <Q REND="inline">"if you don't know the value of &s;ixpence, you'll never be worth fivepence three farthings. How do think got rich, hay?&mdash;by wearing fine coats, and frizzling my pate? No, no; Ma&s;ter Harrel for that! a&s;k him if he'll ca&s;t an account with me!&mdash;never knew a man worth a penny with &s;uch a coat as that on."</Q></P>
<P>Morrice again laughed, and again Mr. Briggs reproved him; and Cecilia, taking advantage of the &s;quabble, &s;tole back to the mu&s;ic-room.</P>
<P>Here, in a few minutes, Mrs. Panton, a lady who frequently vi&s;ited at the hou&s;e, approached Cecilia, followed by a gentle|man, whom &s;he had never before &s;een, but
<PB N="14" REF="13">
who was &s;o evidently charmed with her, that he had looked at no other object &s;ince his entrance into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Panton, pre&s;enting him to her by the name of Mr. Marriot, told her he had begged her interce&s;&s;ion for the honour of her hand in the two fir&s;t dances: and the mo|ment &s;he an&s;wered that &s;he was already en|gaged, the &s;ame reque&s;t was made for the two following. Cecilia had then no excu&s;e, and was therefore obliged to accept him.</P>
<P>The hope &s;he had entertained in the early part of the evening, was already almo&s;t wholly extingui&s;hed; Delvile appeared not! though her eye watched the entrance of every new vi&s;itor, and her vexation made her believe that he alone, of all the town, was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>When the Concert was over, the com|pany joined promi&s;cuou&s;ly for chat and re|fre&s;hments before the ball; and Mr. Go&s;|port advanced to Cecilia, to relate a ridicu|lous di&s;pute which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Briggs and Morrice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, Mr. Go&s;port,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"who &s;eem to make the <HI>minutiae</HI> of ab&s;urd characters your &s;tudy, can explain to me, perhaps, why Mr. Briggs &s;eems to have as much plea&s;ure in proclaiming his meanne&s;s, as in boa&s;ting his wealth?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"he
<PB N="15" REF="14">
knows them, in his own affairs, to be &s;o nearly allied, that but for practi&s;ing the one, he had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the other; ignorant, therefore, of all di&s;crimination,&mdash;except, indeed, of pounds, &s;hillings and pence!&mdash;he &s;uppo&s;es them nece&s;&s;arily in&s;eparable, becau&s;e with him they were united. What you, however, call meanne&s;s, he thinks wi&s;|dom, and recollects, therefore, not with &s;hame but with triumph, the various little arts and &s;ubterfuges by which his coffers have been filled."</Q></P>
<P>Here Lord Ernolf, concluding Cecilia &s;till di&s;engaged from &s;eeing her only di&s;|cour&s;e with Mr. Go&s;port and Mr. Monck|ton, one of whom was old enough to be her father, and the other was a <HI>married man,</HI> ad|vanced, and pre&s;enting to her Lord Der|ford, his &s;on, a youth not yet of age, &s;oli|cited for him the honour of her hand as his partner.</P>
<P>Cecilia, having a double excu&s;e, ea&s;ily declined this propo&s;al; Lord Ernolf, how|ever, was too earne&s;t to be repul&s;ed, and told her he &s;hould again try his intere&s;t when her two pre&s;ent engagements were ful|filled. Hopele&s;s, now, of young Delvile, &s;he heard this intimation with indifference; and was accompanying Mr. Monckton into the ball-room, when Mi&s;s Larolles, flying towards her with an air of infinite eagerne&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
caught her hand, and &s;aid in a whi&s;per <Q REND="inline">"pray let me wi&s;h you joy!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but pray let me a&s;k you of what?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord, now,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure you know what I mean; but you mu&s;t know I have a prodigious mon&s;trous great favour to beg of you: now pray don't re|fu&s;e me; I a&s;&s;ure you if you do, I &s;hall be &s;o mortified you've no notion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, what is it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing but to let me be one of your bride maids. I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall take it as the greate&s;t favour in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My bride maid!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but do you not think the bridegroom him&s;elf will be rather offended to find a bridemaid appointed, before he is even thought of?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray, now,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"don't be ill-natured, for if you are, you've no idea how I &s;hall be di&s;appointed. Only conceive what happened to me three weeks ago! you mu&s;t know I was invited to Mi&s;s Clinton's wedding, and &s;o I made up a new dre&s;s on purpo&s;e, in a very particular &s;ort of &s;hape, quite of my own invention, and it had the &s;weete&s;t effect you can conceive; well, and when the time came, do you know her mo|ther happened to die! Never any thing was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive unlucky, for now &s;he won't be married this half year, and my dre&s;s will be
<PB N="17" REF="16">
quite old and yellow; for its all white, and the mo&s;t beautiful thing you ever &s;aw in your life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my word you are very oblig|ing!"</Q> cried Cecilia laughing; <Q REND="inline">"and pray do you make intere&s;t regularly round with all your female acquaintance to be married upon this occa&s;ion, or am I the only one you think this di&s;tre&s;s will work upon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now how exce&s;&s;ive teazing!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"when you know &s;o well what I mean, and when all the town knows as well as my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then &s;eriou&s;ly enquired whether &s;he had really any meaning at all.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord yes,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you know I mean about Sir Robert Floyer: for I'm told you've quite refu&s;ed Lord Derford."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are you al&s;o told that I have ac|cepted Sir Robert Floyer?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear yes!&mdash;the jewels are bought, and the equipages are built; it's quite a &s;ettled thing, I know very well."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then very gravely began an at|tempt to undeceive her; but the dancing beginning al&s;o at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;tayed not to hear her, hurrying, with a beating heart, to the place of action. Mr. Monck|ton and his fair partner then followed, mu|tually exclaiming again&s;t Mr. Harrel's im|penetrable conduct; of which Cecilia, how|ever,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
in a &s;hort time cea&s;ed wholly to think, for as &s;oon as the fir&s;t cotillon was over, &s;he perceived young Delvile ju&s;t walking into the room.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e, plea&s;ure and confu&s;ion a&s;&s;ailed her all at once; &s;he had entirely given up her expectation of &s;eeing him, and an ab|&s;ence &s;o determined had led her to conclude he had pur&s;uits which ought to make her join in wi&s;hing it lengthened; but now he appeared, that conclu&s;ion, with the fears that gave ri&s;e to it, vani&s;hed; and &s;he re|gretted nothing but the unfortunate &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of engagements which would prevent her dancing with him at all, and probably keep off all conver&s;ation with him till &s;up|per time.</P>
<P>She &s;oon, however, perceived a change in his air and behaviour that extremely a&s;toni&s;hed her: he looked grave and thought|ful, &s;aluted her at a di&s;tance, &s;hewed no &s;ign of any intention to approach her, re|garded the dancing and dancers as a public &s;pectacle in which he had no chance of per|&s;onal intere&s;t, and &s;eemed wholly altered, not merely with re&s;pect to her, but to him|&s;elf, as his former eagerne&s;s for her &s;ociety was not more abated than her former gene|ral gaiety.</P>
<P>She had no time, however, for comments, as &s;he was pre&s;ently called to the &s;econd co|tillon;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
but the confu&s;ed and unplea&s;ant ideas which, without waiting for time or reflection, crowded upon her imagination on ob&s;erving his behaviour, were not more depre&s;&s;ing to her&s;elf, than obvious to her partner; Mr. Monckton by the change in her countenance fir&s;t perceived the entrance of young Delvile, and by her apparent emo|tion and unea&s;ine&s;s, readily penetrated into the &s;tate of her mind; he was confirmed that her affections were engaged; he &s;aw, too, that &s;he was doubtful with what re|turn.</P>
<P>The grief with which he made the fir&s;t di&s;covery, was &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened by the hopes he conceived from the &s;econd; yet the evening was to him as painful as to Cecilia, &s;ince he now knew that whatever pro&s;perity might ultimately attend his addre&s;s and a&s;|&s;iduity, her heart was not her own to be|&s;tow; and that even were he &s;ure of young Delvile's indifference, and actually at liberty to make propo&s;als for him&s;elf, the time of being fir&s;t in her e&s;teem was at an end, and the long earned good opinion which he had hoped would have ripened into affection, might now be wholly undermined by the &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion of a lively &s;tranger, with|out trouble to him&s;elf, and perhaps without plea&s;ure!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
Reflections &s;uch as the&s;e wholly embit|tered the delight he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf from dancing with her, and took from him all power to combat the anxiety with which &s;he was &s;eized; when the &s;econd cotillon, therefore, was over, in&s;tead of following her to a &s;eat, or taking the privilege of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation to conver&s;e with her, the jealou&s;y ri&s;ing in his brea&s;t robbed him of all &s;atisfaction, and gave to him no other de&s;ire than to judge its ju&s;tice by watching her motions at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mean while Cecilia, inattentive whether he accompanied or quitted her, proceeded to the fir&s;t vacant &s;eat. Young Delvile was &s;tanding near it, and, in a &s;hort time, but rather as if he could not avoid than as if he wi&s;hed it, he came to enquire how &s;he did.</P>
<P>The &s;imple&s;t que&s;tion, in the then &s;itua|tion of her mind, was &s;ufficient to confu&s;e her, and though &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he hardly knew what he had a&s;ked. A minute's re|collection, however, re&s;tored an apparent compo&s;ure, and &s;he talked to him of Mrs. Delvile, with her u&s;ual partial regard for that lady, and with an earne&s;t endeavour to &s;eem uncon&s;cious of any alteration in his behaviour.</P>
<P>Yet, to him, even this trifling and ge|neral conver&s;ation was evidently painful,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and he looked relieved by the approach of Sir Robert Floyer, who &s;oon after joined them.</P>
<P>At this time a young lady who was &s;itting by Cecilia, called to a &s;ervant who was pa&s;|&s;ing, for a gla&s;s of lemonade: Cecilia de|&s;ired he would bring her one al&s;o; but Delvile, not &s;orry to break off the di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid he would him&s;elf be her cup-bearer, and for that purpo&s;e went away.</P>
<P>A moment after, the &s;ervant returned with &s;ome lemonade to Cecilia's neighbour, and Sir Robert, taking a gla&s;s from him, brought it to Cecilia at the very in&s;tant young Delvile came with another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think I am before-hand with you, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the in&s;olent Baronet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered young Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I think we were both in together: Mi&s;s Be|verley, however, is &s;teward of the race, and we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to her deci&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, madam,"</Q> cried Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"here we &s;tand, waiting your plea&s;ure. Which is to be the happy man!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Each, I hope,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I ex|pect no le&s;s than that you will both do me the honour of drinking my health."</Q></P>
<P>This little contrivance, which &s;aved her alike from &s;hewing favour or giving offence, could not but be applauded by both par|ties:
<PB N="22" REF="21">
and while they obeyed her orders, &s;he took a third gla&s;s her&s;elf from the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing, Mr. Briggs, again perceiving her, &s;tumpt ha&s;tily towards her, calling out <Q REND="inline">"Ah ha! my duck! what's that? got &s;omething nice? Come here, my lad, ta&s;te it my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>He then took a gla&s;s, but having only put it to his mouth, made a wry face, and returned it, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Bad! bad! poor punch indeed!&mdash;not a drop of rum in it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So much the better, Sir,"</Q> cried Mor|rice, who diverted him&s;elf by following him, <Q REND="inline">"for then you &s;ee the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;pares in &s;omething, and you &s;aid he &s;pared in nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;pare in fools!"</Q> returned Mr. Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"keeps them in plenty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, nor in any out of the way characters,"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So much the wor&s;e,"</Q> cried Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o much the wor&s;e! Eat him out of hou&s;e and home; won't leave him a rag to his back, nor a penny in his pocket. Never mind 'em, my little duck; mind none of your guardians but me: t'other two a'n't worth a ru&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;omewhat a&s;hamed of this &s;peech, looked towards young Delvile, in whom it occa&s;ioned the fir&s;t &s;mile &s;he had &s;een that evening.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
<Q REND="inline">"Been looking about for you!"</Q> conti|nued Briggs, nodding &s;agaciou&s;ly; <Q REND="inline">"be|lieve I've found one will do. Gue&s;s what I mean;&mdash;100,000<HI>l.</HI>&mdash;hay?&mdash;what &s;ay to that? any thing better at the we&s;t end of the town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"100,000<HI>l.</HI>!"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"and pray, Sir, who may this be?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not you, Mr. jackanapes! &s;ure of that. An't quite po&s;itive he'll have you, neither. Think he will, though."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, what age is he?"</Q> cried the never daunted Morrice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why about&mdash;let's &s;ee&mdash;don't know, never heard,&mdash;what &s;ignifies?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, he's an old man, I &s;uppo&s;e, by being &s;o rich?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Old? no, no &s;uch thing; about my own &s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, and do you propo&s;e him for an hu&s;band to Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not? know ever a one warmer? think Ma&s;ter Harrel will get her a better? or t'other old Don, in the grand &s;quare?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you plea&s;e, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia ha&s;|tily, <Q REND="inline">"we will talk of this matter another time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, pray,"</Q> cried young Delvile, who could not forbear laughing, <Q REND="inline">"let it be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hate 'em,"</Q> continued Mr. Briggs,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<Q REND="inline">"hate 'em both! one &s;pending more than he's worth, cheated and over-reached by fools, running into gaol to plea&s;e a parcel of knaves: t'other counting nothing but uncles and grandfathers, dealing out fine names in&s;tead of ca&s;h, ca&s;ting up more cou|&s;ins than guineas&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Again Cecilia endeavoured to &s;ilence him, but, only chucking her under the chin, he went on, <Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, my little duck, never mind 'em; one of 'em i'n't worth a penny, and t'other has nothing in his pockets but li&s;ts of the defunct. What good will come of that? would not give twopence a dozen for 'em! A poor &s;et of grandees, with no|thing but a tie-wig for their portions!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, unable to bear this harangue in the pre&s;ence of young Delvile, who, how|ever, laughed it off with a very good grace, aro&s;e with an intention to retreat, which be|ing perceived by Sir Robert Floyer, who had attended to this dialogue with haughty contempt, he came forward, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"now then, madam, may I have the honour of your hand?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I am engaged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Engaged again?"</Q> cried he, with the air of a man who thought him&s;elf much in|jured.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Glad of it, glad of it!"</Q> &s;aid Mr.
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Brigg; <Q REND="inline">"&s;erved very right! have nothing to &s;ay to him, my chick!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not, Sir?"</Q> cried Sir Robert, with an imperious look.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sha'n't have her, &s;ha'n't have her! can tell you that; won't con&s;ent; know you of old."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what do you know of me, pray Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No good, no good; nothing to &s;ay to you; found fault with my no&s;e! ha'n't for|got it."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Mr. Marriot came to claim his partner, who very willing to quit this &s;cene of wrangling and vulgarity, im|mediately attended him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles, again flying up to her, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"O my dear, we are all expiring to know who that creature is! I never &s;aw &s;uch a horrid fright in my life!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was beginning to &s;atisfy her, but &s;ome more young ladies coming up to join in the reque&s;t, &s;he endeavoured to pa&s;s on; <Q REND="inline">"O but,</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, detaining her, <Q REND="inline">do pray &s;top, for I've &s;omething to tell you that's &s;o mon&s;trous you've no idea. Do you know Mr. Meadows has not danced at all! and he's been &s;tanding with Mr. Saw|yer, and looking on all the time, and whi&s;|pering and laughing &s;o you've no notion. However, I a&s;&s;ure you, I'm exce&s;&s;ive glad
<PB N="26" REF="25">
he did not a&s;k me, for all I have been &s;it|ting &s;till all this time, for I had a great deal rather &s;it &s;till, I a&s;&s;ure you: only I'm &s;orry I put on this dre&s;s, for any thing would have done ju&s;t to look on in that &s;tupid manner."</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Meadows &s;auntered towards them; and all the young ladies began play|ing with their fans, and turning their heads another way, to di&s;gui&s;e the expectations which his approach awakened; and Mi&s;s Larolles, in a ha&s;ty whi&s;per to Cecilia, cri|ed, <Q REND="inline">"Pray don't take any notice of what I &s;aid, for if he &s;hould happen to a&s;k me, I can't well refu&s;e him, you know, for if I do, he'll be &s;o exce&s;&s;ive affronted you can't think."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows then, mixing in the little group, began, with &s;undry grimaces, to ex|claim <Q REND="inline">"how intollerably hot it is! there's no &s;uch thing as breathing. How can any body think of dancing! I am amazed Mr. Harrel has not a ventilator in this room. Don't you think it would be a great im|provement?"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech, though particularly addre&s;|&s;ed to no one, received immediately an a&s;|&s;enting an&s;wer from all the young ladies.</P>
<P>Then, turning to Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"Don't you dance?"</Q> he &s;aid.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me?"</Q> cried &s;he, embarra&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"yes, I
<PB N="27" REF="26">
believe &s;o,&mdash;really I don't know,&mdash;I a'n't quite determined."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, do dance!"</Q> cried he, &s;tretching him&s;elf and yawning, <Q REND="inline">"it always gives me &s;pirits to &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P>Then, turning &s;uddenly to Cecilia, with|out any previous ceremony of renewing his acquaintance, either by &s;peaking or bow|ing, he abruptly &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Do you love danc|ing, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, extremely well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very glad to hear it. You have one thing, then, to &s;often exi&s;tence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you di&s;like it your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What dancing? Oh dreadful! how it was ever adopted in a civilized country I cannot find out; 'tis certainly a Barbarian exerci&s;e, and of &s;avage origin. Don't you think &s;o, Mi&s;s Larolles?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord no,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you I like it better than any thing; I know nothing &s;o delightful, I declare I dare &s;ay I could not live without it; I &s;hould be &s;o &s;tupid you can't conceive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I remember,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Marriot, <Q REND="inline">"when Mr. Meadows was always dancing him&s;elf. Have you forgot, Sir, when you u&s;ed to wi&s;h the night would la&s;t for ever, that you might dance without cea&s;ing?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, who was now intently &s;ur|veying a painting that was over the chim|ney-piece,
<PB N="28" REF="27">
&s;eemed not to hear this que&s;tion, but pre&s;ently called out <Q REND="inline">"I am amazed Mr. Harrel can &s;uffer &s;uch a picture as this to be in his hou&s;e. I hate a portrait, 'tis &s;o wea|ri&s;ome looking at a thing that is doing no|thing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you like hi&s;torical pictures, Sir, any better?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, I dete&s;t them! views of battles, murders, and death! Shocking! &s;hocking!&mdash;I &s;hrink from them with horror!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps you are fond of land&s;capes?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means! Green trees and fat cows! what do they tell one? I hate every thing that is in&s;ipid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your toleration, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"will not be very exten&s;ive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid he, yawning, <Q REND="inline">"one can to|lerate nothing! one's patience is wholly ex|hau&s;ted by the total tediou&s;ne&s;s of every thing one &s;ees, and every body one talks with. Don't you find it &s;o, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sometimes!</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, rather archly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are right, ma'am, extremely right; one does not know what in the world to do with one's &s;elf. At home, one is killed with meditation, abroad, one is overpowered by ceremony; no po&s;&s;ibility of finding ea&s;e or comfort. You never go into public, I think, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not to be much <HI>marked,</HI> I find!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laughing.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
<Q REND="inline">"O, I beg your pardon! I believe I &s;aw you one evening at Almack's: I really beg your pardon, but I had quite forgot it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mr. Meadows,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"don't you know you are meaning the Pantheon? only conceive how you forget things!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Pantheon, was it? I never know one of tho&s;e places from another. I heartily wi&s;h they were all aboli&s;hed; I hate public places. 'Tis terrible to be under the &s;ame roof with a &s;et of people who would care no|thing if they &s;aw one expiring!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are, at lea&s;t, then, fond of the &s;ociety of your friends?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! to be worn out by &s;eeing always the &s;ame faces!&mdash;one is &s;ick to death of friends; nothing makes one &s;o melan|choly."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now went to join the dancers, and Mr. Meadows, turning to Mi&s;s La|rolles, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Pray don't let me keep you from dancing; I am afraid you'll lo&s;e your place."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried &s;he, bridling, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ha'n't dance at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How cruel!"</Q> cried he, yawning, <Q REND="inline">"when you know how it exhilarates me to &s;ee you! Don't you think this room is very clo&s;e? I mu&s;t go and try another atmo|&s;phere,<PB N="30" REF="29">
&mdash;But
I hope you will relent, and dance?"</Q></P>
<P>And then, &s;tretching his arms as if half a&s;leep, he &s;auntered into the next room, where he flung him&s;elf upon a &s;ofa till the ball was over.</P>
<P>The new partner of Cecilia, who was a wealthy, but very &s;imple young man, u&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to entertain and oblige her, and, flattered by the warmth of his own de&s;ire, he fancied that he &s;ucceeded; though, in a &s;tate of &s;uch &s;u&s;pence and anxie|ty, a man of brighter talents had failed.</P>
<P>At the end of the two dances, Lord Er|nolf again attempted to engage her for his &s;on, but &s;he now excu&s;ed her&s;elf from danc|ing any more, and &s;at quietly as a &s;pecta|tre&s;s till the re&s;t of the company gave over. Mr. Marriot, however, would not quit her, and &s;he was compelled to &s;upport with him a trifling conver&s;ation, which, though irk|&s;ome to her&s;elf, to him, who had not <HI>&s;een her in her happier hour,</HI> was delightful.</P>
<P>She expected every in&s;tant to be again joined by young Delvile, but the expecta|tion was di&s;appointed; he came not; &s;he concluded he was in another apartment; the company was &s;ummoned to &s;upper, &s;he then thought it impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;s him; but, after waiting and looking for him in
<PB N="31" REF="30">
vain, &s;he found he had already left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening &s;he &s;carce knew what pa&s;&s;ed, for &s;he attended to nothing; Mr. Monckton might watch, and Mr. Briggs might exhort her, Sir Robert might di&s;play his in&s;olence, or Mr. Marriot his gallantry,&mdash;all was equally indifferent, and equally unheeded, and before half the com|pany left the hou&s;e, &s;he retired to her own room.</P>
<P>She &s;pent the night in the utmo&s;t di&s;tur|bance; the occurrences of the evening with re&s;pect to young Delvile &s;he looked upon as deci&s;ive: if his ab&s;ence had chagrined her, his pre&s;ence had &s;till more &s;hocked her, &s;ince, while &s;he was left to conjecture, though &s;he had fears &s;he had hopes, and though all &s;he &s;aw was gloomy, all &s;he ex|pected was plea&s;ant; but they had now met, and tho&s;e expectations proved fallacious. She knew not, indeed, how to account for the &s;trangene&s;s of his conduct; but in &s;ee|ing it was &s;trange, &s;he was convinced it was unfavourable: he had evidently avoided her while it was in his power, and when, at la&s;t, he was obliged to meet her, he was formal, di&s;tant, and re&s;erved.</P>
<P>The more &s;he recollected and dwelt upon the difference of his behaviour in their pre|ceding meeting, the more angry as well as
<PB N="32" REF="31">
amazed &s;he became at the change, and tho' &s;he &s;till concluded the pur&s;uit of &s;ome other object occa&s;ioned it, &s;he could find no ex|cu&s;e for his ficklene&s;s if that pur&s;uit was recent, nor for his caprice if it was ante|rior.</P>

<P>THE next day Cecilia, to drive Delvile a little from her thoughts, which &s;he now no longer wi&s;hed him to occupy, again made a vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Belfield, who&s;e &s;ociety afforded her more con&s;olation than any other &s;he could procure.</P>
<P>She found her employed in packing up, and preparing to remove to another lodg|ing, for her brother, &s;he &s;aid, was &s;o much better, that he did not think it right to continue in &s;o di&s;graceful a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She talked with her accu&s;tomed openne&s;s of her affairs, and the intere&s;t which Cecilia involuntarily took in them, contributed to le&s;&s;en her vexation in thinking of her own. <Q REND="inline">"The generous friend of my brother,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"who, though but a new acquain|tance to him, has courted him in all his &s;orrows, when every body el&s;e for&s;ook him, has brought him at la&s;t into a better way of thinking.

<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, madam, no; &s;he is wrapt up in him, and cares nothing for all the world be|&s;ides. It was always &s;o, and we have all of us been u&s;ed to it.

in future, for he &s;aid <HI>we</HI> were not reduced to &s;o much indigence, whatever he was: and that as to our accepting money from other people, that we might &s;ave up our own for him, it would be an&s;wering no pur|po&s;e, for he &s;hould think him&s;elf a mon&s;ter to make u&s;e of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what &s;aid your mother?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;he gave him a great many pro|mi&s;es that &s;he would never vex him about it again; and indeed, much as I know we are obliged to you, madam, and gratefully as I am &s;ure I would lay down my life to &s;erve you, I am very glad in this ca&s;e that my brother has found it out. For though I &s;o much wi&s;h him to do &s;omething for him|&s;elf, and not to be &s;o proud, and live in a manner he has no right to do, I think, for all that, that it is a great di&s;grace to my poor father's hone&s;t memory, to have us turn beggars after his death, when he left us all &s;o well provided for, if we had but known how to be &s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is a natural rectitude in your heart,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that the able&s;t ca|&s;ui&s;ts could not mend."</Q></P>
<P>She then enquired whither they were re|moving, and Mi&s;s Belfield told her to Port|land-&s;treet, Oxford Road, where they were to have two apartments up two pair of &s;tairs, and the u&s;e of a very good parlour,
<PB N="36" REF="35">
in which her brother might &s;ee his friends. <Q REND="inline">"And this,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is a luxury for which nobody can blame him, becau&s;e if he has not the appearance of a decent home, no gentleman will employ him."</Q></P>
<P>The Padington hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, was al|ready let, and her mother was determined not to hire another, but &s;till to live as pe|nuriou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, in order, notwith|&s;tanding his remon&s;trances, to &s;ave all &s;he could of her income for her &s;on.</P>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Belfield, who very fa|miliarily &s;aid &s;he came to tell Cecilia they were <HI>all in the wrong box</HI> in letting her &s;on know of the 10<HI>l.</HI> Bank note, <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> con|tinued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"he has a pride that would grace a duke, and he thinks nothing of his hard&s;hips, &s;o long as nobody knows of them. So another time we mu&s;t manage things better, and when we do him any good, not let him know a word of the matter. We'll &s;ettle it all among our&s;elves, and one day or other he'll be glad enough to thank us."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who &s;aw Mi&s;s Belfield colour with &s;hame at the freedom of this hint, now aro&s;e to depart: but Mrs. Belfield begged her not to go &s;o &s;oon, and pre&s;&s;ed her with &s;uch urgency to again &s;it down, that &s;he was ob|liged to comply.</P>
<P>She then began a warm commendation
<PB N="37" REF="36">
of her &s;on, lavi&s;hly prai&s;ing all his good qualities, and exalting even his defects, concluding with &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"But, ma'am, for all he's &s;uch a complete gentleman, and for all he's made &s;o much of, he was &s;o dif|fident, I could not get him to call and thank you for the pre&s;ent you made him, though, when he went his la&s;t airing, I almo&s;t knelt to him to do it. But, with all his merit, he wants as much encouragement as a lady, for I can tell you it is not a little will do for him."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, amazed at this extraordinary &s;peech, looked from the mother to the daughter in order to di&s;cover it's meaning, which, however, was &s;oon rendered plainer by what followed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But pray now, ma'am, don't think him the more ungrateful for his &s;hyne&s;s, for young ladies &s;o high in the world as you are, mu&s;t go pretty good lengths before a young man will get courage to &s;peak to them. And though I have told my &s;on over and over that the ladies never like a man the wor&s;e for being a little bold, he's &s;o much down in the mouth that it has no effect upon him. But it all comes of his being brought up at the univer&s;ity, for that makes him think he knows better than I can tell him. And &s;o, to be &s;ure, he does. However, for all that, it is a hard thing
<PB N="38" REF="37">
upon a mother to find all &s;he &s;ays goes ju&s;t for nothing. But I hope you'll excu&s;e him, ma'am, for it's nothing in the world but his over-mode&s;ty."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now &s;tared with a look of &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;plea&s;ure, that Mrs. Belfield, &s;u&s;pecting &s;he had gone rather too far, added <Q REND="inline">"I beg you won't take what I've &s;aid ami&s;s, ma'am, for we mothers of fami|lies are more u&s;ed to &s;peak out than maiden ladies. And I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much, but only I was afraid you would mi&s;con|&s;true my &s;on's backwardne&s;s, and &s;o that he might be flung out of your favour at la&s;t, and all for nothing but having too much re&s;pect for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear mother!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Belfield, who&s;e face was the colour of &s;carlet, <Q REND="inline">"pray!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What's the matter now?"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield; <Q REND="inline">"you are as &s;hy as your brother; and if we are all to be &s;o, when are we to come to an under&s;tanding?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not immediately, I believe indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"but that we may not plunge deeper in our mi&s;takes, I will for the pre&s;ent take my leave."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, &s;top|ping her, <Q REND="inline">"pray don't go yet, for I've got a great many things I want to talk to you about. In the fir&s;t place, ma'am, pray what
<PB N="39" REF="38">
is your opinion of this &s;cheme for &s;ending my &s;on abroad into foreign parts? I don't know what you may think of it, but as to me, it half drives me out of my &s;en&s;es to have him taken away from me at la&s;t in that unnatural manner. And I'm &s;ure, ma'am, if you would only put in a word again&s;t it, I dare &s;ay he would give it up without a demur."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me?"</Q> cried Cecilia, di&s;engaging her|&s;elf from her hold, <Q REND="inline">"No, madam, you mu&s;t apply to tho&s;e friends who better under|&s;tand his affairs, and who would have a deeper intere&s;t in detaining him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lack a day!"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, with &s;carcely &s;mothered vexation, <Q REND="inline">"how hard it is to make the&s;e grand young ladies come to rea&s;on! As to my &s;on's other friends, what good will it do for him to mind what they &s;ay? who can expect him to give up his journey, without knowing what amends he &s;hall get for it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t &s;ettle this matter with him at your lei&s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot now &s;tay another moment."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Belfield, again finding &s;he had been too precipitate, tried to draw back, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Pray, ma'am, don't let what I have men|tioned go again&s;t my &s;on in your good opi|nion, for he knows no more of it than the furthe&s;t per&s;on in the world, as my daugh|ter
<PB N="40" REF="39">
can te&s;tify: for as to &s;hyne&s;s, he's ju&s;t as &s;hy as a lady him&s;elf; &s;o what good he ever got at the Univer&s;ity, as to the matter of making his fortune, it's what I never could di&s;cover. However, I dare &s;ay he knows be&s;t; though when all comes to all, if I was to &s;peak my mind, I think he's made but a poor hand of it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who only through compa&s;&s;ion to the blu&s;hing Henrietta forbore repre&s;&s;ing this forwardne&s;s more &s;eriou&s;ly, merely an|&s;wered Mrs. Belfield by wi&s;hing her good morning: but, while &s;he was taking a kind|er leave of her timid daughter, the mother added <Q REND="inline">"As to the pre&s;ent, ma'am, you was &s;o kind to make us, Henny can witne&s;s for me every penny of it &s;hall go to my &s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I rather meant it,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for your daughter; but if it is of u&s;e to any body, my purpo&s;e is &s;ufficiently an&s;wered."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Belfield again pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;it down, but &s;he would not again li&s;ten to her, coldly &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry you trou|bled Mr. Belfield with any mention of what pa&s;&s;ed between his &s;i&s;ter and me, but &s;hould you &s;peak of it again, I beg you will ex|plain to him that he had no concern in that little tran&s;action, which belonged wholly to our&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>She then ha&s;tened down &s;tairs, followed, however, by Mrs. Belfield, making awk|ward
<PB N="41" REF="40">
excu&s;es for what &s;he had &s;aid, inter|mixed with frequent hints that &s;he knew all the time &s;he was in the right.</P>
<P>This little incident, which convinced Ce|cilia Mrs. Belfield was firmly per&s;uaded &s;he was in love with her &s;on, gave her much unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he feared the &s;on him&s;elf might entertain the &s;ame notion, and thought it mo&s;t probable the daughter al&s;o had imbib|ed it, though but for the forward vulgarity of the &s;anguine mother, their opinions might long have remained concealed. Her bene|volence towards them, notwith&s;tanding its purity, mu&s;t now therefore cea&s;e to be ex|erted: nor could &s;he even vi&s;it Mi&s;s Bel|field, &s;ince prudence, and a regard for her own character, &s;eemed immediately to pro|hibit all commerce with the family.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And thus difficult,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is the blamele&s;s u&s;e of riches, though all who want them, think nothing &s;o ea&s;y as their di&s;po&s;al! This family I have &s;o much wi&s;h|ed to &s;erve, I may at la&s;t only have injured, &s;ince the di&s;appointment of their higher ex|pectations, may render all &s;maller benefits contemptible. And thus this unfortunate mi&s;con&s;truction of my good offices, robs them of a u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and deprives me at the &s;ame time of an amiable companion."</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he returned home, &s;he had a letter put into her hand which came from
<PB N="42" REF="41">
Mr. Marriot, who&s;e &s;ervant had twice cal|led for an an&s;wer in the &s;hort time &s;he had been ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>This letter contained a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate avowal of the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on his heart the preceding evening, and an angry complaint that Mr. Harrel had re|fu&s;ed to hear his propo&s;als. He entreated her permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon her for only five minutes, and concluded with the mo&s;t fervent profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and admira|tion.</P>
<P>The precipitancy of this declaration &s;erv|ed merely to confirm the opinion &s;he had al|ready conceived of the weakne&s;s of his un|der&s;tanding: but the ob&s;tinacy of Mr. Har|rel irritated and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, though weary of expo&s;tulating with &s;o hopele&s;s a &s;ubject, whom neither rea&s;on nor gratitude could turn from his own purpo&s;es, &s;he was oblig|ed to &s;ubmit to his management, and was well content, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, to affirm his decree. She therefore wrote a conci&s;e an&s;wer to her new admirer, in the u&s;ual form of civil rejection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN ACCOMMODATION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA was informed the next morning that a young woman begged to &s;peak with her, and upon &s;ending for her up &s;tairs, &s;he &s;aw, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, Mi&s;s Belfield.</P>
<P>She came in fear and trembling, &s;ent, &s;he &s;aid, by her mother, to entreat her pardon for what had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding day; <Q REND="inline">"But I know, madam,"</Q> &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"you cannot pardon it, and therefore all that I mean to do is to clear my brother from any &s;hare in what was &s;aid, for indeed he has too much &s;en&s;e to harbour any &s;uch pre&s;ump|tion; and to thank you with a mo&s;t grateful heart for all the goodne&s;s you have &s;hewn us."</Q></P>
<P>And then, mode&s;tly court&s;ying, &s;he would have returned home; but Cecilia, much touched by her gentlene&s;s, took her hand, and kindly reviving her by a&s;&s;urances of e&s;teem, entreated that &s;he would lengthen her &s;tay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How good is this, madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"after having &s;o much rea&s;on to think &s;o ill of me and of all of us! I tried all in my
<PB N="44" REF="43">
power to undeceive my mother, or at lea&s;t to keep her quiet; but &s;he was &s;o much per&s;uaded &s;he was right, that &s;he never would li&s;ten to me, and always &s;aid, did I &s;uppo&s;e it was for <HI>me</HI> you conde&s;cended to come &s;o often?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t un|doubtedly; had I not known you, how|ever well I might have wi&s;hed your brother, I &s;hould certainly not have vi&s;ited at his hou&s;e. But I am very happy to hear the mi&s;take had &s;pread no further."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No indeed, madam, I never once thought of it; and as to my brother, when my mother only hinted it to him, he was quite angry. But though I don't mean to vindicate what has happened, you will not, I hope, be di&s;plea&s;ed if I &s;ay my mother is much more pardonable than &s;he &s;eems to be, for the &s;ame mi&s;take &s;he made with you, &s;he would have been as apt to have made with a prince&s;s; it was not, therefore, from any want of re&s;pect, but merely from thinking my brother might marry as high as he plea&s;ed, and believing no lady would refu&s;e him, if he would but have the courage to &s;peak."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would think no more of the error, but told her that to avoid its renewal, &s;he mu&s;t decline calling upon her again till her brother was gone. She begged therefore to &s;ee her in Portman-&s;quare
<PB N="45" REF="44">
whenever &s;he had lei&s;ure, repeatedly a&s;&s;uring her of her good opinion and regard, and of the plea&s;ure with which &s;he &s;hould &s;eize every opportunity of &s;hewing them.</P>
<P>Delighted by a reception &s;o kind, Mi&s;s Belfield remained with her all the morning; and when at la&s;t &s;he was obliged to leave her, &s;he was but too happy in being &s;oli|cited to repeat her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She &s;uffered one day only to elap&s;e be|fore &s;he &s;hewed her readine&s;s to accept the friend&s;hip that was offered her; and Ceci|lia, much plea&s;ed by this eagerne&s;s, redoub|led her efforts to oblige and to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>From this time, hardly a day pa&s;&s;ed in which &s;he did not call in Portman-&s;quare, where nothing in her reception was omitted that could contribute to her contentment. Cecilia was glad to employ her mind in any way that related not to Delvile, whom &s;he now earne&s;tly endeavoured to think of no more, denying her&s;elf even the plea&s;ure of talking of him with Mi&s;s Belfield, by the name of <HI>her brother's noble friend.</HI></P>
<P>During this time &s;he devi&s;ed various me|thods, all too delicate to give even the &s;ha|dow of offence, for making both u&s;eful and ornamental pre&s;ents to her new favourite, with whom &s;he grew daily more &s;atisfied, and to whom &s;he purpo&s;ed hereafter offering a re&s;idence in her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
The trial of intimacy, &s;o difficult to the able&s;t to &s;tand, and from which even the mo&s;t faultle&s;s are &s;o rarely acquitted, Mi&s;s Belfield &s;u&s;tained with honour. Cecilia found her artle&s;s, ingenuous, and affection|ate; her under&s;tanding was good, though no pains had been taken to improve it; her di&s;po&s;ition though ardent was &s;oft, and her mind &s;eemed informed by intuitive inte|grity.</P>
<P>She communicated to Cecilia all the af|fairs of her family, di&s;gui&s;ing from her nei|ther di&s;tre&s;s nor meanne&s;s, and &s;eeking to palliate nothing but the gro&s;&s;er parts of the character of her mother. She &s;eemed equal|ly ready to make known to her even the mo&s;t cho&s;en &s;ecrets of her own bo&s;om, for that &s;uch &s;he had was evident, from a fre|quent appearance of ab&s;ence and unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he took but little trouble to conceal. Cecilia, however, tru&s;ted not her&s;elf, in the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of her own mind, with any enquiries that might lead to a &s;ub|ject &s;he was con&s;cious &s;he ought not to dwell upon: a &s;hort time, &s;he hoped, would to|tally remove her &s;u&s;pence; but as &s;he had much le&s;s rea&s;on to expect good than evil, &s;he made it her immediate &s;tudy to prepare for the wor&s;t, and therefore carefully avoid|ed all di&s;cour&s;e that by nouri&s;hing her ten|derne&s;s, might weaken her re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">
While thus, in friendly conver&s;ation and virtuous forbearance, pa&s;&s;ed gravely, but not unhappily, the time of Cecilia, the re&s;t of the hou&s;e was very differently employed: fea&s;ting, revelling, amu&s;ements of all &s;orts were pur&s;ued with more eagerne&s;s than ever, and the alarm which &s;o lately threatened their de&s;truction, &s;eemed now merely to heighten the avidity with which they were &s;ought. Yet never was the di&s;union of happine&s;s and diver&s;ion more &s;triking and obvious; Mr. Harrel, in &s;pite of his natu|ral levity, was &s;eized from time to time with fits of horror that embittered his gaye&s;t mo|ments, and ca&s;t a cloud upon all his enjoy|ments. Always an enemy to &s;olitude, he now found it wholly in&s;upportable, and ran into company of any &s;ort, le&s;s from a hope of finding entertainment, than from a dread of &s;pending half an hour by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who &s;aw that his rapacity for plea&s;ure encrea&s;ed with his unea&s;ine&s;s, once more ventured to &s;peak with his lady upon the &s;ubject of reformation; coun&s;elling her to take advantage of his pre&s;ent apparent di&s;content, which &s;hewed at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;en|&s;ibility of his &s;ituation, in order to point out to him the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate in&s;pection into his affairs, which, with a to|tal change in his way of life, was her only
<PB N="48" REF="47">
chance for &s;natching him from the di&s;mal de&s;pondency into which he was &s;inking.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel declared her&s;elf unequal to following this advice, and &s;aid that her whole &s;tudy was to find Mr. Harrel amu&s;e|ment, for he was grown &s;o ill-humoured and petulant &s;he quite feared being alone with him.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e therefore now was more crowd|ed than ever, and nothing but di&s;&s;ipation was thought of. Among tho&s;e who upon this plan were courted to it, the foremo&s;t was Mr. Morrice, who, from a peculiar ta|lent of uniting &s;ervility of conduct with gaiety of &s;peech, made him&s;elf at once &s;o agreeable and u&s;eful in the family, that in a &s;hort time they fancied it impo&s;&s;ible to live without him. And Morrice, though his fir&s;t view in obtaining admittance had been the cultivation of his acquaintance with Cecilia, was perfectly &s;atisfied with the turn that matters had taken, &s;ince his utmo&s;t vanity had never led him to entertain any matrimonial hopes with her, and he thought his fortune as likely to profit from the ci|vility of her friends as of her&s;elf. For Morrice, however flighty and wild, had al|ways at heart the &s;tudy of his own intere&s;t; and though from a giddy forwardne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition he often gave offence, his mean|ing
<PB N="49" REF="48">
and his &s;erious attention was not the le&s;s directed to the advancement of his own affairs: he formed no connection from which he hoped not &s;ome benefit, and he con&s;ider|ed the acquaintance and friend&s;hip of his &s;uperiors in no other light than that of pro|curing him &s;ooner or later recommendations to new clients.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Floyer al&s;o was more frequent than ever in his vi&s;its, and Mr. Harrel, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of Ceci|lia, contrived every po&s;&s;ible opportunity of giving him acce&s;s to her. Mrs. Harrel her&s;elf, though hitherto neutral, now plead|ed his cau&s;e with earne&s;tne&s;s; and Mr. Ar|nott, who had been her former refuge from this per&s;ecution, grew &s;o &s;erious and &s;o ten|der in his devoirs, that unable any longer to doubt the &s;entiments &s;he had in&s;pired, &s;he was compelled even with him to be guard|ed and di&s;tant.</P>
<P>She now with daily concern looked back to the &s;acrifice &s;he had made to the worth|le&s;s and ungrateful Mr. Harrel, and was &s;ometimes tempted to immediately chu&s;e another guardian, and leave his hou&s;e for ever: yet the delicacy of her di&s;po&s;ition was aver&s;e to any &s;tep that might publicly expo&s;e him, and her early regard for his wife would not &s;uffer her to put it in execution.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances contributed &s;trongly
<PB N="50" REF="49">
to encrea&s;e her intimacy with Mi&s;s Belfield; &s;he now never &s;aw Mrs. Delvile, whom alone &s;he preferred to her, and from the trouble|&s;ome a&s;&s;iduity of Sir Robert, &s;carce ever met Mr. Monckton but in his pre&s;ence: &s;he found, therefore, no re&s;ource again&s;t teazing and vexation, but what was afforded her by the conver&s;ation of the amiable Henrietta.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A DETECTION.</HEAD>
<P>A Fortnight had now elap&s;ed in which Cecilia had had no &s;ort of communica|tion with the Delviles, whom equally from pride and from prudence &s;he forbore to &s;eek her&s;elf, when one morning, while &s;he was &s;itting with Mi&s;s Belfield, her maid told her that young Mr. Delvile was in the drawing|room, and begged the honour of &s;eeing her for a few moments.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he &s;tarted and changed colour with &s;urprize at this me&s;&s;age, was uncon&s;cious &s;he did either, from the yet greater &s;urprize &s;he received by the beha|viour of Mi&s;s Belfield, who ha&s;tily ari&s;ing, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mr. Delvile!&mdash;do you know Mr. Delvile, madam?&mdash;does Mr. Delvile vi&s;it at this hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sometimes; not often,"</Q> an&s;wered Ce|cilia; <Q REND="inline">"but why?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know,&mdash;nothing, madam,&mdash;I only a&s;ked by accident, I believe,&mdash;but it's very&mdash;it's extremely&mdash;I did not know&mdash;"</Q> and colouring violently, &s;he again &s;at down.</P>

An apprehen&s;ion the mo&s;t painful now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cecilia, and ab&s;orbed in thought, &s;he continued for &s;ome minutes &s;ilent and immovable.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate &s;he was awakened by her maid, who a&s;ked if &s;he cho&s;e to have her gloves.</P>
<P>Cecilia, taking them from her without &s;peaking, left the room, and not daring to &s;top for enquiry or con&s;ideration, ha&s;tened down &s;tairs; but when &s;he entered the apartment where young Delvile was waiting for her, all utterance &s;eemed denied her, and &s;he court&s;ied without &s;aying a word.</P>
<P>Struck with the look and uncommon manner of her entrance, he became in a mo|ment as much di&s;turbed as her&s;elf, pouring forth a thou&s;and unnece&s;&s;ary and embarra&s;|&s;ed apologies for his vi&s;it, and &s;o totally forgetting even the rea&s;on why he made it, that he had taken his leave and was depart|ing before he recollected it. He then turn|ed back, forcing a laugh at his own ab&s;ence of mind, and told her he had only called to acquaint her, that the commands with which &s;he had honoured him were now obeyed, and, he hoped, to her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who knew not &s;he had ever given him any, waited his further explanation; and he then informed her he had that very morning introduced Mr. Belfield to the Earl
<PB N="53" REF="52">
of Vannelt, who had already heard him very advantageou&s;ly &s;poken of by &s;ome gentle|men to whom he had been known at the Univer&s;ity, and who was &s;o much plea&s;ed with him upon this fir&s;t interview, that he meant, after a few enquiries, which could not but turn out to his credit, to commit his elde&s;t &s;on to his tru&s;t in making the tour of Europe.</P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for her &s;hare in the trouble he had taken in this tran&s;action; and then a&s;ked if Mrs. Delvile continued well.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he, with a &s;mile half reproachful, <Q REND="inline">"as well as one who having ever hoped your favour, can ea&s;ily be after finding that hope di&s;appointed. But much as &s;he has taught her &s;on, there is one le&s;&s;on &s;he might perhaps learn from him;&mdash;to fly, not &s;eek, tho&s;e dangerous indulgen|ces of which the deprivation is the lo&s;s of peace!"</Q></P>
<P>He then bowed, and made his exit.</P>
<P>This unexpected reproof, and the yet more unexpected compliment that accompanied it, in both which <HI>more &s;eemed meant than met the ear,</HI> encrea&s;ed the perturbation into which Cecilia had already been thrown. It occurred to her that under the &s;anction of his mother's name, he had taken an opportu|nity of making an apology for his own
<PB N="54" REF="53">
conduct; yet why avoiding her &s;ociety, if to that he alluded, &s;hould be <HI>flying a dange|rous indulgence,</HI> &s;he could not under&s;tand, &s;ince he had &s;o little rea&s;on to fear any re|pul&s;e in continuing to &s;eek it.</P>
<P>Sorry, however, for the abrupt manner in which &s;he had left Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;he lo&s;t not a moment in ha&s;tening back to her; but when &s;he came into the room, &s;he found her employed in looking out of the window, her eye following &s;ome object with &s;uch ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of attention, that &s;he perceived not her return.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who could not doubt the motive of her curio&s;ity, had no great difficulty in forbearing to offer her any interruption. She drew her head back in a few minutes, and ca&s;ting it upwards, with her hands cla&s;ped, &s;oftly whi&s;pered, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven ever &s;hield and ble&s;s him! and O may he never feel &s;uch pain as I do!"</Q></P>
<P>She then again looked out, but &s;oon drawing her&s;elf in, &s;aid, in the &s;ame &s;oft ac|cents, <Q REND="inline">"Oh why art thou gone! &s;weete&s;t and noble&s;t of men! why might I not &s;ee thee longer, when, under heaven, there is no other ble&s;&s;ing I wi&s;h for!"</Q></P>
<P>A &s;igh which at the&s;e words e&s;caped Ce|cilia made her &s;tart and turn towards the door; the deepe&s;t blu&s;hes over&s;pread the cheeks of both as their eyes met each other,
<PB N="55" REF="54">
and while Mi&s;s Belfield trembled in every limb at the di&s;covery &s;he had made, Ceci|lia her&s;elf was hardly able to &s;tand.</P>
<P>A painful and mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ilence &s;ucceeded, which was only broken by Mi&s;s Belfield's bur&s;ting into tears.</P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely moved, forgot for a moment her own intere&s;t in what was pa&s;|&s;ing, and tenderly approaching, embraced her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s: but &s;till &s;he &s;poke not, fearing to make any enquiry, from dreading to hear any explanation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;oothed by her &s;oftne&s;s, clung about her, and hiding her face in her arms, &s;obbed out <Q REND="inline">"Ah madam! who ought to be unhappy if befriended by you! if I could help it, I would love nobody el&s;e in almo&s;t the whole world. But you mu&s;t let me leave you now, and to-morrow I will tell you every thing."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who had no wi&s;h for making any oppo&s;ition, embraced her again, and &s;uffer|ed her quietly to depart.</P>
<P>Her own mind was now in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The rectitude of her heart and the &s;oundne&s;s of her judgment had hi|therto guarded her both from error and blame, and, except during her recent &s;u&s;|pence, had pre&s;erved her tranquility invio|late: but her commerce with the world had been &s;mall and confined, and her actions
<PB N="56" REF="55">
had had little reference but to her&s;elf. The ca&s;e was now altered; and &s;he was &s;uddenly in a conjuncture of all others the mo&s;t de|licate, that of accidentally di&s;covering a rival in a favourite friend.</P>
<P>The fondne&s;s &s;he had conceived for Mi&s;s Belfield, and the &s;incerity of her intentions as well as promi&s;es to &s;erve her, made the detection of this &s;ecret peculiarly cruel: &s;he had lately felt no plea&s;ure but in her &s;ocie|ty, and looked forward to much future com|fort from the continuance of her regard, and from their con&s;tantly living together: but now this was no longer even to be de|&s;ired, &s;ince the utter annihilation of the wi&s;hes of both, by young Delvile's being di&s;po&s;ed of to a third per&s;on, could alone render eli|gible their dwelling under the &s;ame roof.</P>
<P>Her pity, however, for Mi&s;s Belfield was almo&s;t wholly unallayed by jealou&s;y; &s;he harboured not any &s;u&s;picion that &s;he was loved by young Delvile, who&s;e a&s;piring &s;pi|rit led her infinitely more to fear &s;ome high|er rival, than to believe he be&s;towed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta: but &s;till &s;he wi&s;hed with the utmo&s;t ardour to know the length of their acquaintance, how often they had met, when they had conver&s;ed, what notice he had taken of her, and how &s;o dangerous a preference had invaded her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56">
But though this curio&s;ity was both natu|ral and powerful, her principal concern was the arrangement of her own conduct: the next day Mi&s;s Belfield was to tell her every thing by a voluntary promi&s;e; but &s;he doubted if &s;he had any right to accept &s;uch a confidence. Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;he was &s;ure, knew not &s;he was intere&s;ted in the tale, &s;ince &s;he had not even imagined that Delvile was known to her. She might hope, therefore, not only for advice but a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and fancy that while &s;he repo&s;ed her &s;ecret in the bo|&s;om of a friend, &s;he &s;ecured her&s;elf her be&s;t offices and be&s;t wi&s;hes for ever.</P>
<P>Would &s;he obtain them? no; the mo&s;t romantic genero&s;ity would revolt from &s;uch a demand, for however precarious was her own chance with young Delvile, Mi&s;s Bel|field &s;he was &s;ure could not have any: nei|ther her birth nor education fitted her for his rank in life, and even were both unex|ceptionable, the &s;mallne&s;s of her fortune, as Mr. Monckton had in&s;tructed her, would be an ob&s;tacle in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>Would it not be a kind of treachery to gather from her every thing, yet aid her in nothing? to take advantage of her un&s;u&s;|picious openne&s;s in order to learn all that related to one whom &s;he yet hoped would belong ultimately to her&s;elf, and gratify an intere&s;ted curio&s;ity at the expence of a can|dour
<PB N="58" REF="57">
not more &s;imple than amiable? <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"arts that I could never for|give, I never will practice; this &s;weet, but unhappy girl &s;hall tell me nothing: betray|ed already by the tenderne&s;s of her own heart, &s;he &s;hall at lea&s;t &s;uffer no further from any duplicity in mine. If, indeed, Mr. Delvile, as I &s;u&s;pect, is engaged el&s;ewhere, I will make this gentle Henrietta the object of my future &s;olicitude: the &s;ympathy of our &s;ituations will not then divide but unite us, and I will take her to my bo&s;om, hear all her &s;orrows, and calm her troubled &s;pi|rit by participating in her &s;en&s;ibility. But if, on the contrary, this my&s;tery ends more happily for my&s;elf, if Mr. Delvile has now no other engagement, and hereafter clears his conduct to my &s;atisfaction, I will not be aece&s;&s;ory to loading her future recollection with the &s;hame of a confidence &s;he then can|not but repent, nor with an injury to her delicacy that may wound it for ever."</Q></P>
<P>She determined, therefore, carefully to avoid the &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent, &s;ince &s;he could offer no advice for which &s;he might not, hereafter, be &s;u&s;pected of &s;elfi&s;h mo|tives; but yet, from a real regard to the tender-hearted girl, to give all the tacit di&s;|couragement that was in her power, to a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he firmly believed would be productive of nothing but mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">
Once, from the frankne&s;s natural to her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he thought not merely of re|ceiving but returning her confidence: her better judgment, however, &s;oon led her from &s;o hazardous a plan, which could only have expo&s;ed them both to a romantic hu|miliation, by which, in the end, their mu|tual expectations might prove &s;ources of mutual di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Belfield, therefore, the next morning, her air unu&s;ually timid, and her whole face covered with blu&s;hes, made her vi&s;it, Cecilia, not &s;eeming to notice her confu&s;ion, told her &s;he was very &s;orry &s;he was obliged to go out her&s;elf, and contriv|ed, under various pretences, to keep her maid in the room. Mi&s;s Belfield, &s;uppo&s;|ing this to be accidental, rejoiced in her imaginary reprieve, and &s;oon recovered her u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s: and Cecilia, who really meant to call upon Mrs. Delvile, borrowed Mrs. Harrel's carriage, and &s;et down her artle&s;s young friend at her new lodgings in Portland-&s;treet, before &s;he proceeded to St. James's-&s;quare, talking the whole time upon matters of utter indifference.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="59">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. A SARCASM.</HEAD>
<P>THE reproach which Cecilia had re|ceived from young Delvile in the name of his mother, determined her upon making this vi&s;it; for though, in her pre&s;ent un|certainty, &s;he wi&s;hed only to &s;ee that family when &s;ought by them&s;elves, &s;he was yet de|&s;irous to avoid all appearance of &s;ingulari|ty, le&s;t any &s;u&s;picions &s;hould be rai&s;ed of her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile received her with a cold ci|vility that chilled and afflicted her: &s;he found her &s;eriou&s;ly offended by her long ab|&s;ence, and now for the fir&s;t time perceived that haughtine&s;s of character which hither|to &s;he had thought only given to her by the calumny of envy; for though her di&s;plea|&s;ure was undi&s;gui&s;ed, &s;he deigned not to make any reproaches, evidently &s;hewing that her di&s;appointment in the lo&s;s of her &s;ociety, was embittered by a proud regret for the kindne&s;s &s;he believed &s;he had thrown away. But though &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly forbore the &s;malle&s;t complaint, &s;he failed not from time to time to ca&s;t out reflections upon
<PB N="61" REF="60">
ficklene&s;s and caprice the mo&s;t &s;atirical and pointed.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who could not po&s;&s;ibly avow the motives of her behaviour, ventured not to offer any apology for her apparent negli|gence; but, hitherto accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed kindne&s;s, a change to &s;o much bitterne&s;s &s;hocked and overpowered her, and &s;he &s;at almo&s;t wholly &s;ilent, and hardly able to look up.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria Pemberton, a daughter of the Duke of Derwent, now came into the room, and afforded her &s;ome relief by the &s;prightline&s;s of her conver&s;ation. This young lady, who was a relation of the Del|viles, and of a character the mo&s;t airy and unthinking, ran on during her whole vi&s;it in a vein of fa&s;hionable &s;candal, with a levity that the cen&s;ures of Mrs. Delvile, though by no means &s;pared, had no power to con|troll: and, after having completely ran|&s;acked the topics of the day, &s;he turned &s;uddenly to Cecilia, with whom during her re&s;idence in St. James's-&s;quare &s;he had made &s;ome acquaintance, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"So I hear, Mi&s;s Beverley, that after half the town has given you to Sir Robert Floyer, and the other half to my Lord Derford, you intend, without regarding one &s;ide or the other, to di&s;appoint them both, and give your&s;elf to Mr. Marriot."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61">
<Q REND="inline">"Me? no, indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip has been much mi&s;inform|ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"for Mr. Marriot, by all I ever heard of him, &s;eems to have but one recommendation, and that the la&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley ought to value, a good e&s;tate."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;ecretly delighted by a &s;peech which &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t flattering her&s;elf had reference to her &s;on, now a little reviv|ed, and endeavoured to bear &s;ome part in the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every body one meets,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;po&s;es of Mi&s;s Beverley to &s;ome new per&s;on; yet the common opinion is that Sir Robert Floyer will be the man. But upon my word, for my own part, I cannot conjecture how &s;he will manage among them, for Mr. Marriot declares he's determined he won't be refu&s;ed, and Sir Robert vows that he'll never give her up. So we none of us know how it will end: but I am va&s;tly glad &s;he keeps them &s;o long in &s;u&s;pence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If there is any &s;u&s;pence,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I am at lea&s;t &s;ure it mu&s;t be wilful. But why &s;hould your lady&s;hip rejoice in it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, becau&s;e it helps to torment them, and keeps &s;omething going forward. Be|&s;ides, we are all looking in the news-pa|pers
<PB N="63" REF="62">
every day, to &s;ee when they'll fight another duel for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Another?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"indeed they have never yet fought any for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I beg your pardon,"</Q> an&s;wered her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Robert, you know, fought one for you in the beginning of the winter, with that Iri&s;h fortune-hunter who affront|ed you at the Opera."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Iri&s;h fortune-hunter?"</Q> repeated Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;trangely has that quarrel been mi&s;repre&s;ented! In the fir&s;t place, I never was affronted at the Opera at all, and in the &s;econd, if your Lady&s;hip means Mr. Bel|field, I que&s;tion if he ever was in Ireland in his life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"he might come from Scotland, for ought I know, but &s;omewhere he certainly came from; and they tell me he is wounded ter|ribly, and Sir Robert has had all his things packed up this month, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould die, he may go abroad in a mo|ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray where, Lady Honoria,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"do you contrive to pick up all this rattle?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I don't know; every body tells me &s;omething, &s;o I put it all together as well as I can. But I could acquaint you with a
<PB N="64" REF="63">
&s;tranger piece of news than any you have heard yet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, if I let you know it, you'll tell your &s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile laugh|ing, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall probably forget it my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>She then made &s;ome further difficulty, and Cecilia, uncertain if &s;he was meant to be a party in the communication, &s;trolled to a window; where, however, as Lady Honoria did not lower her voice, &s;he heard her &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"Why you mu&s;t know I am told he keeps a mi&s;tre&s;s &s;omewhere in Oxford|Road. They &s;ay &s;he's mighty pretty; I &s;hould like va&s;tly to &s;ee her."</Q></P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of Cecilia at this in|telligence would certainly have betrayed all &s;he &s;o much wi&s;hed to conceal, had not her fortunate removal to the window guarded her from ob&s;ervation. She kept her po&s;t, fearing to look round, but was much plea&s;|ed when Mrs. Delvile, with great indigna|tion an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Lady Hono|ria, you can find any amu&s;ement in li&s;ten|ing to &s;uch idle &s;candal, which tho&s;e who tell will never re&s;pect you for hearing. In times le&s;s daring in &s;lander, the character of Mortimer would have proved to him a &s;hield from all injurious a&s;per&s;ions; yet who &s;hall
<PB N="65" REF="64">
wonder he could not e&s;cape, and who &s;hall contemn the inventors of calumny, if Lady Honoria Pemberton conde&s;cends to be en|tertained with it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Mrs. Delvile,"</Q> cried Lady Ho|noria, giddily, <Q REND="inline">"you take me too &s;e|riou&s;ly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And dear Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I would it were po&s;&s;ible to make you take your&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly; for could you once &s;ee with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion how much you lower your own dignity, while you &s;toop to depreciate that of others, the very &s;ubjects that now make your diver|&s;ion, would then, far more properly, move your re&s;entment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay but, dear madam,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"if that were the ca&s;e, I &s;hould be quite perfect, and then you and I &s;hould never quarrel, and I don't know what we &s;hould do for conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>And with the&s;e words, ha&s;tily &s;haking hands with her, &s;he took leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Such conver&s;ation,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Del|vile when &s;he was gone, <Q REND="inline">"as re&s;ults from the mixture of fruitle&s;s admonition with incorrigible levity, would be indeed <HI>more honoured in the breach than the ob&s;ervance.</HI> But levity is &s;o much the fa&s;hionable characte|ri&s;tic of the pre&s;ent age, that a gay young girl who, like Lady Honoria Pemberton,
<PB N="66" REF="65">
rules the friends by whom &s;he ought to be ruled, had little chance of e&s;caping it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She &s;eems &s;o open, however, to re|proof,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould hope in a &s;hort time &s;he may al&s;o be open to con|viction."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I have no hope of her at all. I once took much pains with her; but I &s;oon found that the ea&s;ine&s;s with which &s;he hears of her faults, is only another effect of the levity with which &s;he commits them. But if the young are never tired of erring in conduct, nei|ther are the older in erring in judgment; the fallibility of <HI>mine</HI> I have indeed very lately experienced."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who &s;trongly felt the poignancy of this &s;arca&s;m, and who&s;e con&s;tant and unaffected value of Mrs. Delvile by no means de&s;erved it, was again &s;ilenced, and again mo&s;t cruelly depre&s;&s;ed: nor could &s;he &s;ecretly forbear repining that at the very moment &s;he found her&s;elf threatened with a nece&s;&s;ity of foregoing the &s;ociety of her new favourite, Mi&s;s Belfield, the woman in the whole world whom &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to have for her friend, from an unhappy mi&s;take was ready to relinqui&s;h her. Grieved to be thus fallen in her e&s;teem, and &s;hocked that &s;he could offer no ju&s;tification, after a &s;hort and thoughtful pau&s;e, &s;he gravely aro&s;e to take leave.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66">
Mrs. Delvile then told her that if &s;he had any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with Mr. Del|vile, &s;he advi&s;ed her to acquaint him with it &s;oon, as the whole family left town in a few days.</P>
<P>This was a new and &s;evere blow to Ceci|lia, who &s;orrowfully repeated <Q REND="inline">"In a few days, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you intend to be much concerned?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried Cecilia, who could no longer pre&s;erve her quietne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"if you knew but half the re&s;pect I bear you, but half the &s;incerity with which I value and re|vere you, all prote&s;tations would be u&s;e|le&s;s, for all accu&s;ations would be over!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, at once &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;of|tened by the warmth of this declaration, in|&s;tantly took her hand, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"They &s;hall now, and for every be over, if it pains you to hear them. I concluded that what I &s;aid would be a matter of indifference to you, or all my di&s;plea&s;ure would immedi|ately have been &s;atisfied, when once I had intimated that your ab&s;ence had excited it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I have excited it at all,"</Q> an|&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"gives me indeed the &s;evere&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; but believe me, madam, how|ever unfortunately appearances may be again&s;t me, I have always had the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the kindne&s;s with which you have honoured me, and never has there been the

&s;malle&s;t abatement in the veneration, grati|tude and affection I have inviolably borne you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"that where reproof takes any effect, it is not received with that ea&s;ine&s;s you were ju&s;t now admiring: on the con|trary, where a conce&s;&s;ion is made without pain, it is al&s;o made without meaning, for it is not in human nature to project any amendment without a &s;ecret repugnance. That here, however, you &s;hould differ from Lady Honoria Pemberton, who can wonder, when you are &s;uperior to all com|pari&s;on with her in every thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"ac|cept my apology, and forgive me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will do more,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I will forgive you <HI>without</HI> an apology; for the truth is I have heard none!

<P>She then embraced her affectionately, and owned &s;he had been more mortified by her fancied de&s;ertion than &s;he had been willing to own even to her&s;elf, repeatedly a&s;&s;uring her that for many years &s;he had not made any aquaintance &s;he &s;o much wi&s;hed to cul|tivate,

nor enjoyed any &s;ociety from which &s;he had derived &s;o much plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e eyes gli&s;tened with mode&s;t joy, while her heart beat quick with reviv|ed expectation, in li&s;tening to an effu&s;ion of prai&s;e &s;o infinitely grateful to her, found little difficulty in returning her friendly profe&s;&s;ions, and, in a few minutes, was not merely reconciled, but more firmly united with her than ever.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile in&s;i&s;ted upon keeping her to dinner, and Cecilia, but too happy in her earne&s;tne&s;s, readily agreed to &s;end Mrs. Harrel an excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither of the Mr. Delviles &s;pent the day at home, and nothing, therefore, di&s;|turbed or interrupted tho&s;e glowing and de|lightful &s;en&s;ations which &s;pring from a cor|dial renewal of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s. The report, indeed, of Lady Honoria Pem|berton gave her &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, yet the flighty character of that lady, and Mrs. Delvile's reply to it, &s;oon made her drive it from her mind.</P>
<P>She returned home early in the evening, as other company was expected, and &s;he had not changed her dre&s;s &s;ince the morning; but &s;he fir&s;t made a promi&s;e to &s;ee Mrs. Delvile &s;ome part of every day during the &s;hort time that &s;he meant to remain in town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A SURMISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning opened with ano|ther &s;cene; Mrs. Harrel ran into Ce|cilia's room before breakfa&s;t, and acquaint|ed her that Mr. Harrel had not been at home all night.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation with which &s;he heard this account &s;he in&s;tantly endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate, in order to &s;often the apprehen&s;i|on with which it was communicated: Mrs. Harrel, however, was extremely unea&s;y, and &s;ent all the town over to make enquiries, but without receiving any intelligence.</P>
<P>Cecilia, unwilling to leave her in a &s;tate of &s;uch alarm, wrote an excu&s;e to Mrs. Del|vile, that &s;he might continue with her till &s;ome information was procured. A &s;ubject al&s;o of &s;uch immediate concern, was &s;uffi|cient apology for avoiding any particular conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Belfield, who called as u&s;ual, about noon, and who&s;e &s;u&s;ceptible heart was much affected by the evident di&s;|turbance in which &s;he found Cecilia.</P>
<P>The whole day pa&s;&s;ed, and no news ar|rived:
<PB N="71" REF="70">
but, greatly to her a&s;toni&s;hment, Mrs. Harrel in the evening prepared for going to an a&s;&s;embly! yet declaring at the &s;ame time it was extremely di&s;agreeable to her, only &s;he was afraid, if &s;he &s;tayed away, every body would &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething was the matter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who then at la&s;t, thought Cecilia, are half &s;o much the &s;laves of the world as the gay and the di&s;&s;ipated? Tho&s;e who work for hire, have at lea&s;t their hours of re&s;t, tho&s;e who labour for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, are at li|berty when &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is procured; but tho&s;e who toil to plea&s;e the vain and the idle, undertake a ta&s;k which can never be fini&s;hed, however &s;crupulou&s;ly all private peace, and all internal comfort, may be &s;a|crificed in reality to the folly of &s;aving ap|pearances!"</Q></P>
<P>Lo&s;ing, however, the motive for which &s;he had given up her own engagement, &s;he now &s;ent for her chair, in order to &s;pend an hour or two with Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, as they conducted her up &s;tairs, &s;aid they would call their lady; and in entering the drawing-room &s;he &s;aw, read|ing and alone, young Delvile.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed, but received her with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, apologizing for the ab&s;ence of his mother, whom he &s;aid had under&s;tood &s;he was not to &s;ee her till
<PB N="72" REF="71">
the next day, and had left him to write letters now, that &s;he might then be at li|berty.</P>
<P>Cecilia in return made excu&s;es for her &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency; after which, for &s;ome time, all conver&s;ation dropt.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence was at length broken by young Delvile's &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Belfield's me|rit has not been thrown away upon Lord Vannelt; he has heard an excellent cha|racter of him from all his former acquain|tance, and is now fitting up an apartment for him in his own hou&s;e till his &s;on begins his tour."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;aid &s;he was very happy in hearing &s;uch intelligence; and then again they were both &s;ilent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have &s;een,"</Q> &s;aid young Delvile, after this &s;econd pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Belfield's &s;i&s;ter?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, not without changing colour, an|&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">She is very amiable,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"too amiable, indeed, for her &s;ituation, &s;ince her relations, her brother alone excepted, are all utterly unworthy of her."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt; but Cecilia made no an&s;wer, and he pre&s;ently added <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps you do not think her amiable?&mdash;you may have &s;een more of her, and know &s;omething to her di&s;advantage?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">
<Q REND="inline">"O no!"</Q> cried Cecilia, with a forced alacrity, <Q REND="inline">"but only I was thinking that&mdash;did you &s;ay you knew all her rela|tions?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"but when I have been with Mr. Belfield, &s;ome of them have called upon him."</Q></P>
<P>Again they were both &s;ilent; and then Cecilia, a&s;hamed of her apparent backward|ne&s;s to give prai&s;e, compelled her&s;elf to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Belfield is indeed a very &s;weet girl, and I wi&s;h&mdash;"</Q> &s;he &s;topt, not well knowing her&s;elf what &s;he meant to add.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been greatly plea&s;ed,"</Q> &s;aid he, after waiting &s;ome time to hear if &s;he would fini&s;h her &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"by being informed of your goodne&s;s to her, and I think &s;he &s;eems equally to require and to de&s;erve it. I doubt not you will extend it to her when &s;he is deprived of her brother, for then will be the time that by doing her mo&s;t &s;ervice, it will reflect on your&s;elf mo&s;t ho|nour."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, confounded by this recommen|dation, faintly an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Certainly,&mdash;whatever is in my power,&mdash;I &s;hall be very glad&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>And ju&s;t then Mrs. Delvile made her ap|pearance, and during the mutual apologies that followed, her &s;on left the room. Ce|cilia, glad of any pretence to leave it al&s;o,
<PB N="74" REF="73">
in&s;i&s;ted upon giving no interruption to Mrs&punc; Delvile's letter writing, and having pro|mi&s;ed to &s;pend all the next day with her&punc; hurried back to her chair.</P>
<P>The reflections that followed her thithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were by no means the mo&s;t &s;oothing: &s;he began now to apprehend that the pity &s;he had be&s;towed upon Mi&s;s Belfield, Mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Belfield in a &s;hort time might be&s;tow upon her: at any other time, his recommen+dation would merely have &s;erved to con+firm her opinion of his benevolence, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of anxiety and uncer+tainty, every thing gave birth to conjec+ture, and had power to alarm her.

<P>Yet, if &s;uch was the ca&s;e, what was to become either of the pride or the intere&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his family? Would his relations eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> pardon an alliance &s;timulated neither by rank nor riches? would Mr. Delvile, who hardly ever &s;poke but to the high-born&punc; without &s;eeming to think his dignity &s;ome|what <PB N="75" REF="74">
injured, deign to receive for a daugh|ter in law the child of a citizen and trade&s;|man? would Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf, little le&s;s elevated in her notions, though infinite|ly &s;ofter in her manners, ever conde&s;cend to acknowledge her? Cecilia's own birth and connections, &s;uperior as they were to tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Belfield, were even openly di&s;dained by Mr. Delvile, and all her ex|pectations of being received into his family were founded upon the largene&s;s of her for|tune, in favour of which the brevity of her genealogy might perhaps pa&s;s unnoticed. But what was the chance of Mi&s;s Belfield, who neither had ance&s;tors to boa&s;t, nor wealth to allure?</P>

Perhaps he means to marry her, and to &s;acrifice to her innocence and her attrac|tions all plans of ambition, and all views of aggrandizement:&mdash;thrice happy Henrietta, if &s;uch is thy pro&s;pect of felicity! to have in&s;pired a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, may humble the mo&s;t in&s;olent of thy &s;upe|riors, and teach even the wealthie&s;t to envy thee!"</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A BOLD STROKE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Cecilia returned home, &s;he heard with much concern that no tidings of Mr. Harrel had yet been obtain|ed. His lady, who did not &s;tay out late, was now very &s;eriou&s;ly frightened, and en|treated Cecilia to &s;it up with her till &s;ome news could be procured: &s;he &s;ent al&s;o for her brother, and they all three, in tremb|ling expectation of what was to en&s;ue, pa&s;|&s;ed the whole night in watching.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, Mr. Ar|nott be&s;ought his &s;i&s;ter and Cecilia to take &s;ome re&s;t, promi&s;ing to go out him&s;elf to every place where Mr. Harrel was known to re&s;ort, and not to return without bring|ing &s;ome account of him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e feelings were not very acute, finding the per&s;ua&s;ions of her brother were &s;econded by her own fatigue, con&s;ented to follow his advice, and de&s;ired him to begin his &s;earch immediately.</P>
<P>A few moments after he was gone, while Mrs. Harrel and Cecilia were upon the &s;tairs,
<PB N="78" REF="77">
they were &s;tartled by a violent knocking at the door: Cecilia, prepared for &s;ome cala|mity, hurried her friend back to the draw|ing room, and then flying out of it again to enquire who entered, &s;aw to her equal &s;ur|prize and relief, Mr. Harrel him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She ran back with the welcome informa|tion, and he in&s;tantly followed her: Mrs. Harrel eagerly told him of her fright, and Cecilia expre&s;&s;ed her plea&s;ure at his return: but the &s;atisfaction of neither was of long duration.</P>
<P>He came into the room with a look of fiercene&s;s the mo&s;t terrifying, his hat on, and his arms folded. He made no an&s;wer to what they &s;aid, but pu&s;hed back the door with his foot, and flung him&s;elf upon a &s;ofa.</P>
<P>Cecilia would now have withdrawn, but Mrs. Harrel caught her hand to prevent her. They continued &s;ome minutes in this &s;ituation, and then Mr. Harrel, &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, called out <Q REND="inline">"Have you any thing to pack up?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pack up?"</Q> repeated Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s me, for what?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am going abroad;"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;et off to-morrow."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Abroad?"</Q> cried &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I hope not!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hope nothing!"</Q> returned he, in a
<PB N="79" REF="78">
voice of rage; and then, with a dreadful oath, he ordered her to leave him and pack up.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, wholly unu&s;ed to &s;uch treatment, was frightened into violent hy|&s;terics; of which, however, he took no no|tice, but &s;wearing at her for <HI>a fool who had been the cau&s;e of his ruin,</HI> he left the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he in&s;tantly rang the bell, and ha&s;tened to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was &s;o much &s;hocked by this unexpected brutality, that &s;he &s;carcely knew how to act, or what to order. Mrs. Harrel, however, &s;oon re|covered, and Cecilia accompanied her to her own apartment, where &s;he &s;tayed, and endeavoured to &s;ooth her till Mr. Arnott re|turned.</P>
<P>The terrible &s;tate in which Mr. Harrel had at la&s;t come home was immediately communicated to him, and his &s;i&s;ter en|treated him to u&s;e all his influence that the &s;cheme for going abroad might be deferred, at lea&s;t, if not wholly given up.</P>
<P>Fearfully he went on the emba&s;&s;y, but &s;peedily, and with a look wholly di&s;mayed, he returned. Mr. Harrel, he &s;aid, told him that he had contracted a larger debt of ho|nour than he had any means to rai&s;e, and as he could not appear till it was paid, he was obliged to quit the kingdom without delay.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh brother!"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and can you &s;uffer us to go?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, my dear &s;i&s;ter,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"what can I do to prevent it? and who, if I too am ruined, will in future help you?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel then wept bitterly, nor could the gentle Mr. Arnott, forbear, while he tried to comfort her, mixing his own tears with tho&s;e of his beloved &s;i&s;ter; but Ceci|lia, who&s;e rea&s;on was &s;tronger, and who&s;e ju&s;tice was offended, felt other &s;en&s;ations: and leaving Mrs. Harrel to the care of her brother, who&s;e tenderne&s;s &s;he infinitely compa&s;&s;ionated, &s;he retreated into her own room. Not, however, to re&s;t; the dread|ful &s;ituation of the family made her forget &s;he wanted it, but to deliberate upon what cour&s;e &s;he ought her&s;elf to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>She determined without any he&s;itation again&s;t accompanying them in their flight, as the irreparable injury &s;he was convinced &s;he had already done her fortune, was more than &s;uffiicient to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t romantic ideas of friend&s;hip and humanity: but her own place of abode mu&s;t now immediately be changed, and her choice re&s;ted only be|tween Mr. Delvile and Mr. Briggs.</P>
<P>Important as were the ob&s;tacles which oppo&s;ed her re&s;idence at Mr. Delvile's, all that belonged to inclination and to happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="81" REF="80">
encouraged it: while with re&s;pect to Mr. Briggs, though the objections were lighter, there was not a &s;ingle allurement. Yet whenever the &s;u&s;picion recurred to her that Mi&s;s Belfield was beloved by young Delvile, &s;he re&s;olved at all events to avoid him: but when better hopes intervened, and repre&s;ented that his enquiries were pro|bably accidental, the wi&s;h of being finally acquainted with his &s;entiments, made no|thing &s;o de&s;irable as an intercour&s;e more frequent.</P>
<P>Such &s;till was her irre&s;olution, when &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Arnott to en|treat the honour of &s;eeing her. She imme|diately went down &s;tairs, and found him in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"what can I do for my &s;i&s;ter! what can I po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e to relieve her af|fliction!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I know not!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but the utter impracticability of prepar|ing her for this blow, obviou&s;ly as it has long been impending, makes it now fall &s;o heavily I wi&s;h much to a&s;&s;i&s;t her,&mdash;but a debt &s;o unju&s;tifiably contracted&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O madam,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"ima|gine not I &s;ent to you with &s;o treacherous a view as to involve you in our mi&s;ery; far too unworthily has your genero&s;ity already
<PB N="82" REF="81">
been abu&s;ed. I only wi&s;h to con&s;ult with you what I can do for my &s;i&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, after &s;ome little con&s;ideration, propo&s;ed that Mrs. Harrel &s;hould &s;till be left in England, and under their joint care.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I have already made that propo&s;al, but Mr. Harrel will not go without her, though his whole be|haviour is &s;o totally altered, that I fear to tru&s;t her with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is there, then, that has more weight with him?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall we &s;end for Sir Robert Floyer to &s;econd our reque&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>"To this Mr. Arnott a&s;&s;ented, forget|ting in his apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing his &s;i&s;ter, the pain he &s;hould &s;uffer from the interfe|rence of his rival.</P>
<P>The Baronet pre&s;ently arrived, and Ceci|lia, not chu&s;ing to apply to him her&s;elf, left him with Mr. Arnott, and waited for intelligence in the library.</P>
<P>In about an hour after, Mrs. Harrel ran into the room, her tears dried up, and out of breath with joy, and called out <Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t friend, my fate is now all in your hands, and I am &s;ure you will not refu&s;e to make me happy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is it I can do for you?"</Q> cried Cecilia, dreading &s;ome impracticable pro|po&s;al;
<PB N="83" REF="82">
<Q REND="inline">"a&s;k me not, I be&s;eech you, what I cannot perform!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what I a&s;k requires nothing but good nature; Sir Ro|bert Floyer has been begging Mr. Harrel to leave me behind, and he has promi&s;ed to comply, upon condition you will ha&s;ten your marriage, and take me into your own hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My marriage!"</Q> cried the a&s;toni&s;hed Cecilia.</P>
<P>Here they were joined by Mr. Harrel him&s;elf, who repeated the &s;ame offer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You both amaze and &s;hock me!"</Q> cri|ed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"what is it you mean, and why do you talk to me &s;o wildly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"it is high time now to give up this re&s;erve, and trifle no longer with a gentleman &s;o un|exceptionable as Sir Robert Floyer. The whole town has long acknowledged him as your hu&s;band, and you are every where re|garded as his bride, a little frankne&s;s, there|fore, in accepting him, will not only bind him to you for ever, but do credit to the genero&s;ity of your character."</Q></P>
<P>At that moment Sir Robert him&s;elf bur&s;t into the room, and &s;eizing one of her hands, while both of them were uplifted in mute amazement, he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, poured forth a volley of &s;uch compliments as he had
<PB N="84" REF="83">
never before prevailed with him&s;elf to ut|ter, and confidently entreated her to com|plete his long-attended happine&s;s without the cruelty of further delay.</P>
<P>Cecilia, almo&s;t petrified by the exce&s;s of her &s;urpri&s;e, at an attack &s;o violent, &s;o bold, and apparently &s;o &s;anguine, was for &s;ome time &s;carce able to &s;peak or to defend her|&s;elf; but when Sir Robert, pre&s;uming on her &s;ilence, &s;aid &s;he had made him the hap|pie&s;t of men, &s;he indignantly drew back her hand, and with a look of di&s;plea&s;ure that required little explanation, would have walked out of the room: when Mr. Har|rel, in a tone of bitterne&s;s and di&s;appoint|ment, called out <Q REND="inline">"Is this lady-like tyranny then never to end?"</Q> And Sir Robert, im|patiently following her, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"And is my &s;u&s;pence to endure for ever? After &s;o many months attendance&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This, indeed, is &s;omething too much,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, turning back, <Q REND="inline">"You have been kept, Sir, in no &s;u&s;pence; the whole tenor of my conduct has uniformly declar|ed the &s;ame di&s;approbation I at pre&s;ent avow, and which my letter, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t have put beyond all doubt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Harrel,"</Q> exclaimed Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"did not you tell me&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pho, pho,"</Q> cried Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;ig|nifies calling upon me? I never &s;aw in Mi&s;s
<PB N="85" REF="84">
Beverley any di&s;approbation beyond what it is cu&s;tomary for young ladies of a &s;entimen|tal turn to &s;hew; and every body knows that where a gentleman is allowed to pay his devoirs for any length of time, no lady intends to u&s;e him very &s;everely."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you, Mr. Harrel,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"after &s;uch conver&s;ations as have pa&s;|&s;ed between us, per&s;evere in this wilful mi&s;apprehen&s;ion? But it is vain to debate where all rea&s;oning is di&s;regarded, or to make any prote&s;tations where even rejection is received as a favour."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with an air of di&s;dain, &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted upon pa&s;&s;ing them, and went to her own room.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, &s;till followed, and clinging round her, &s;till &s;upplicated her pity and compliance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What infatuation is this!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible that you, too, can &s;up|po&s;e I ever mean to accept Sir Robert?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure I do,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for Mr. Harrel has told me a thou&s;and times, that however you played the prude, you would be his at la&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though doubly irritated again&s;t Mr. Harrel, was now appea&s;ed with his lady, who&s;e mi&s;take, however ill-founded, offered an excu&s;e for her behaviour: but &s;he a&s;&s;ured her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms that
<PB N="86" REF="85">
her repugnance to the Baronet was unalter|able, yet told her &s;he might claim from her every good office that was not wholly un|rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The&s;e were words of &s;lender comfort to Mrs. Harrel, who well knew that her wi&s;hes and rea&s;on had but little affinity, and &s;he &s;oon, therefore, left the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia then re&s;olved to go in&s;tantly to Mrs. Delvile, acquaint her with the nece&s;&s;i|ty of her removal, and make her deci&s;ion whither, according to the manner in which her intelligence &s;hould be received.</P>
<P>She &s;ent, therefore, to order a chair, and was already in the hall, when &s;he was &s;topt by the entrance of Mr. Monckton, who, addre&s;&s;ing her with a look of ha&s;te and ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will not a&s;k whither you are going &s;o early, or upon what errand, for I mu&s;t beg a moment's audience, be your bu&s;ine&s;s what it may."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then accompanied him to the de|&s;erted breakfa&s;t-room, which none but the &s;ervants had this morning entered, and there, gra&s;ping her hand, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, you mu&s;t fly this hou&s;e directly! it is the region of di&s;order and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and unfit to contain you."</Q></P>
<P>She a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was that moment pre|paring to quit it, but begged he would ex|plain him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
<Q REND="inline">"I have taken care,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to be well informed of all the proceedings of Mr. Harrel; and the in|telligence I procured this morning is of the mo&s;t alarming nature. I find he &s;pent the night before the la&s;t entirely at a gaming table, where, intoxicated by a run of good luck, he pa&s;&s;ed the whole of the next day in rioting with his profligate intimates, and la&s;t night, returning again to his favourite amu&s;ement, he not only lo&s;t all he had gained, but much more than he could pay. Doubt not, therefore, but you will be cal|led upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: he &s;till con&s;iders you as his re&s;ource in times of danger, and while he knows you are under his roof, he will always believe him&s;elf &s;ecure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every thing indeed con&s;pires,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, more &s;hocked than &s;urpri&s;ed at this account, <Q REND="inline">"to make it nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould quit his hou&s;e: yet I do not think he has at pre&s;ent any further expectations from me, as he came into the room this morning not merely without &s;peaking to me, but behav|ed with a brutality to Mrs. Harrel that he mu&s;t be certain would give me di&s;gu&s;t. It &s;hewed me, indeed, a new part of his cha|racter, for ill as I have long thought of him, I did not &s;u&s;pect he could be guilty of &s;uch unmanly cruelty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The character of a game&s;ter,"</Q> &s;aid Mr.
<PB N="88" REF="87">
Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"depends &s;olely upon his luck; his di&s;po&s;ition varies with every throw of the dice, and he is airy, gay and good hu|moured, or &s;our, moro&s;e and &s;avage, nei|ther from nature nor from principle, but wholly by the caprice of chance."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then related to him the &s;cene in which &s;he had ju&s;t been engaged with Sir Robert Floyer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">is a <HI>manoeuvre</HI> I have been &s;ome time expecting: but Mr. Harrel, though artful and &s;elfi&s;h, is by no means deep. The plan he had formed would have &s;ucceeded with &s;ome women, and he therefore concluded it would with all. So many of your &s;ex have been &s;ubdued by per&s;everance, and &s;o many have been con|quered by boldne&s;s, that he &s;uppo&s;ed when he united two &s;uch powerful be&s;iegers in the per&s;on of a Baronet, he &s;hould vanqui&s;h all ob&s;tacles. By a&s;&s;uring you that the world thought the marriage already &s;ettled, he hoped to &s;urpri&s;e you into believing there was no help for it, and by the &s;udden|ne&s;s and vehemence of the attack, to fright|en and hurry you into compliance. His own wife, he knew, might have been ma|naged thus with ea&s;e, and &s;o, probably, might his &s;i&s;ter, and his mother, and his cou&s;in, for in love matters, or what are &s;o called, women in general are readily duped.
<PB N="89" REF="88">
He di&s;cerned not the &s;uperiority of your un|der&s;tanding to tricks &s;o &s;hallow and imper|tinent, nor the firmne&s;s of your mind in maintaining its own independence. No doubt but he was amply to have been re|warded for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and probably had you this morning been propitious, the Ba|ronet in return was to have cleared him from his pre&s;ent difficulty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Even in my own mind,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I can no longer de&s;end him, for he could never have been &s;o eager to promote the in|tere&s;t of Sir Robert, in the pre&s;ent terrible &s;ituation of his own affairs, had he not been &s;timulated by &s;ome &s;ecret motives. His &s;chemes and his artifices, however, will now be utterly lo&s;t upon me, &s;ince your warning and advice, aided by my own &s;uffering ex|perience of the inutility of all I can do for him, will effectually guard me from all his future attempts.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Re&s;t no &s;ecurity upon your&s;elf,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you have no know|ledge of the many tricks and inventions by which you may yet be plundered. Perhaps he may beg permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ide in your hou&s;e in Suffolk, or de&s;ire an annuity for his wife, or chu&s;e to receive your fir&s;t rents when you come of age; and whatever he may fix upon, his dagger and his bowl will not fail to procure him.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed!&mdash;is young Delvile, then, go|ing abroad?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Abroad?&mdash;no,&mdash;I believe not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, I only imagined it from your chu&s;ing to re&s;ide in his hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not chu&s;e it,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"but is not any thing prefer|able to dwelling with Mr. Briggs?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton cool|ly, <Q REND="inline">"nor &s;hould I have &s;uppo&s;ed he had any chance with you, had I not hitherto ob&s;erved that your convenience has always been &s;acrificed to your &s;en&s;e of propriety."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, touched by prai&s;e &s;o full of cen|&s;ure, and earne&s;t to vindicate her delica|cy, after an internal &s;truggle, which Mr. Monckton was too &s;ubtle to interrupt, pro|te&s;ted &s;he would go in&s;tantly to Mr. Briggs, and &s;ee if it were po&s;&s;ible to be &s;ettled in his hou&s;e, before &s;he made any attempt to fix her&s;elf el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And when?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"perhaps this afternoon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can go out no where this morning; I mu&s;t &s;tay with Mrs. Harrel."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="90">
<Q REND="inline">"You thought otherwi&s;e when I came, you were then content to leave her."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia's alacrity, however, for changing her abode, was now at an end, and &s;he would fain have been left quietly to re-con|&s;ider her plans: but Mr. Monckton urged &s;o &s;trongly the danger of her lengthened &s;tay in the hou&s;e of &s;o de&s;igning a man as Mr. Harrel, that he prevailed with her to quit it without delay, and had him&s;elf the &s;atis|faction of handing her to her chair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A MISER'S MANSION.</HEAD>
<P>MR. BRIGGS was at home, and Ce|cilia in&s;tantly and briefly informed him that it was inconvenient for her to live any longer at Mr. Harrel's, and that if &s;he could be accommodated at his hou&s;e, &s;he &s;hould be glad to re&s;ide with him during the re&s;t of her minority.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall, &s;hall,"</Q> cried he, extremely plea&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"take you with all my heart. Warrant ma&s;ter Harrel's made a good pen|ny of you. Not a bit the better for dre&s;|&s;ing &s;o fine; many a rogue in a gold lace hat."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia begged to know what apartments he could &s;pare for her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take you up &s;tairs,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hew you a place for a queen."</Q></P>
<P>He then led her up &s;tairs, and took her to a room entirely dark, and &s;o clo&s;e for want of air that &s;he could hardly breathe in it. She retreated to the landing-place till he had opened the &s;hutters, and then &s;aw an apartment the mo&s;t forlorn &s;he had ever beheld, containing no other furniture than
<PB N="93" REF="92">
a ragged &s;tuff bed, two worn-out ru&s;h-bot|tomed chairs, an old wooden box, and a bit of broken gla&s;s which was fa&s;tened to the wall by two bent nails.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"See here, my little chick,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"every thing ready! and a box for your gimcracks into the bargain."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You don't mean this place for me, Sir!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;taring.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do, do; <Q REND="inline">"cried he,"</Q> a deal nicer by and by. Only wants a little furbi&s;hing: &s;oon put to rights. Never &s;weep a room out of u&s;e; only wears out brooms for no|thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, can I not have an apartment on the fir&s;t floor?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, &s;omething el&s;e to do with it; belongs to the club; &s;ecrets in all things! Make this do well enough. Come again next week; wear quite a new face. No|thing wanting but a table; pick you up one at a broker's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I am obliged, Sir, to leave Mr. Harrel's hou&s;e directly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, make &s;hift without a table at fir&s;t; no great matter if you ha'n't one at all, nothing particular to do with it. Want another blanket, though. Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by. Under&s;tand how to deal with him! A clo&s;e dog, but warm."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">
<Q REND="inline">"I have al&s;o two &s;ervants, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Won't have 'em! Sha'n't come! Eat me out of hou&s;e and home."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever they eat, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"will be wholly at my expence, as will every thing el&s;e that belongs to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Better get rid of them: hate &s;ervants; all a pack of rogues: think of nothing but &s;tuffing and guttling."</Q></P>
<P>Then opening another door, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ee here,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"my own room ju&s;t by; &s;nug as a church!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, following him into it, lo&s;t a great part of her &s;urpri&s;e at the prai&s;e he had la|vi&s;hed upon that which he de&s;tined for her|&s;elf, by perceiving that his own was yet more &s;cantily furni&s;hed, having nothing in it but a mi&s;erable bed without any curtains, and a large che&s;t, which, while it contain|ed his clothes, &s;ufficed both for table and chair.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What are doing here?"</Q> cried he ang|rily, to a maid who was making the bed, <Q REND="inline">"can't you take more care? beat out all the feathers, &s;ee! two on the ground; no|thing but wa&s;te and extravagance! never mind how &s;oon a man's ruined.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I can never want more than I do here,"</Q> &s;aid the girl, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o that's one comfort."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="94">
Cecilia now began to repent &s;he had made known the purport of her vi&s;it, for &s;he found it would be utterly impo&s;&s;ible to ac|commodate either her mind or her per&s;on to a re&s;idence &s;uch as was here to be ob|tained: and &s;he only wi&s;hed Mr. Monck|ton had been pre&s;ent, that he might him&s;elf be convinced of the impracticability of his &s;cheme. Her whole bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, now, was to retract her offer, and e&s;cape from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, when he turned from his &s;ervant, <Q REND="inline">"that I cannot be receiv|ed here without inconvenience, and there|fore I will make &s;ome new arrangement in my plan."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"like to have you, 'tis but fair, all in our turn; won't be chou&s;ed; Ma&s;ter Harrel's had his &s;hare. Sorry could not get you that &s;weet-heart! would not bite; &s;oon find out another; never fret."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But there are &s;o many things with which I cannot po&s;&s;ibly di&s;pen&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"that I am certain my removing hither would occa&s;ion you far more trouble than you at pre&s;ent forefee."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no; get all in order &s;oon: go about my&s;elf; know how to bid; under|&s;tand trap; always go &s;habby; no making a bargain in a good coat. Look &s;harp at

the goods; &s;ay they won't do; come away; &s;end &s;omebody el&s;e for 'em. Never go twice my&s;elf; nothing got cheap if one &s;eems to have a hankering."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I am &s;ure it is not po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, hurrying down &s;tairs, <Q REND="inline">"that my room, and one for each of my &s;ervants, &s;hould be ready in time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes,"</Q> cried he, following her, <Q REND="inline">"ready in a trice. Make a little &s;hift at fir&s;t; double the blanket till we get ano|ther; lie with the maid a night or two; never &s;tand for a trifle."</Q></P>
<P>And, when &s;he was &s;eated in her chair, the whole time di&s;claiming her intention of returning, he only pinched her cheek with a facetious &s;mirk, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"By, by, little duck; come again &s;oon.

<P>And then &s;he left the hou&s;e; fully &s;atis|fied that no one could blame her refu&s;ing to inhabit it, and much le&s;s chagrined than &s;he was willing to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf, in find|ing &s;he had now no re&s;ource but in the Del|viles.</P>
<P>Yet, in her &s;erious reflections, &s;he could not but think her&s;elf &s;trangely unfortunate that the guardian with whom alone it &s;eem|ed proper for her to re&s;ide, &s;hould by par&s;i|mony, vulgarity, and meanne&s;s, render riches

<P>CECILIA's next progre&s;s, therefore, was to St. James's-&s;quare, whither &s;he went in the utmo&s;t anxiety, from her un|certainty of the reception with which her propo&s;al would meet.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants informed her that Mr. and Mrs. Delvile were at breakfa&s;t, and that the Duke of Derwent and his two daughters were with them.</P>
<P>Before &s;uch witne&s;&s;es to relate the rea|&s;ons of her leaving the Harrels was impo&s;|&s;ible; and from &s;uch a party to &s;end for Mrs. Delvile, would, by her &s;tately guar|dian, be deemed an indecorum unpardon|able.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear &s;o! I have tried what is po&s;&s;ible to di&s;&s;uade him, and my poor &s;i&s;ter has wept without cea&s;ing. Indeed, if &s;he will take no con&s;olation, I believe I &s;hall do what &s;he plea&s;es, for I cannot bear the &s;ight of her in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"the greate&s;t danger for <HI>me</HI> is what I have now no power to run from!"</Q></P>

as I now find for ever: but I have no heart for refu&s;al, nor would my &s;i&s;ter at this mo|ment be thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but that I have no|thing more to give without I cut down my trees, or &s;ell &s;ome farm, &s;ince all I was worth, except my landed property, is al|ready gone. What, therefore, I can now do to &s;ave Mr. Harrel from this de&s;perate expedition I know not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;peak with &s;everity of one &s;o nearly connected with you, yet, &s;uffer me to a&s;k, why &s;hould he be &s;aved from it at all? and what is there he can at pre&s;ent do better? Has not he long been threatened with every evil that is now arrived? have we not both warned him, and have not the clamours of his cre|ditors a&s;&s;ailed him? yet what has been the con&s;equence? he has not &s;ubmitted to the &s;malle&s;t change in his way of life, he has not denied him&s;elf a &s;ingle indulgence, nor &s;pared any expence, nor thought of any re|formation. Luxury has followed luxury, and he has only grown fonder of extrava|gance, as extravagance has become more dangerous. Till the pre&s;ent &s;torm, there|fore, blows over, leave him to his fate, and when a calm &s;ucceeds, I will my&s;elf, for the &s;ake of Pri&s;cilla, aid you to &s;ave what is po&s;&s;ible of the wreck."</Q></P>

<P>Mr. Arnott almo&s;t wept his thanks for this conce&s;&s;ion, and Cecilia, happy in mak|ing it to him in&s;tead of Mr. Harrel, then went to her own room, and wrote the fol|lowing letter to Mrs. Delvile.</P>

<P>Cecilia, charmed with this note, could now no longer forbear looking forward to brighter pro&s;pects, &s;lattering her&s;elf that once under the roof of Mrs. Delvile, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be happy, let the engage|ments or behaviour of her &s;on be what they might.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A GAMESTER'S CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this &s;oothing pro&s;pect, Cecilia was pre&s;ently di&s;turbed by Mrs. Har|rel's maid, who came to entreat &s;he would ha&s;ten to her lady, whom &s;he feared was going into fits.</P>
<P>Cecilia flew to her immediately, and found her in the mo&s;t violent affliction. She u&s;ed every kind effort in her power to quiet and con&s;ole her, but it was not without the utmo&s;t difficulty &s;he could &s;ob out the cau&s;e of this fre&s;h &s;orrow, which indeed was not trifling. Mr. Harrel, &s;he &s;aid, had told her he could not po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e money even for his travelling expenses, without ri&s;king a di&s;covery of his project, and being &s;eized by his creditors: he had therefore charged her, <HI>through her brother or her friend,</HI> to pro|cure for him 3000<HI>l.</HI> as le&s;s would not &s;uf|fice to maintain them while abroad, and he knew no method by which he could have any remittances without danger. And, when &s;he he&s;itated in her compliance, he &s;uriou&s;ly accu&s;ed her of having brought on
<PB N="108" REF="107">
all this di&s;tre&s;s by her negligence and want of management, and declared that if &s;he did not get the money, &s;he would only be &s;erv|ed as &s;he merited by &s;tarving in a foreign gaol, which he &s;wore would be the fate of them both.</P>
<P>The horror and indignation with which Cecilia heard this account were un&s;peak|able. She &s;aw evidently that &s;he was again to be played upon by terror and di&s;tre&s;s, and the cautions and opinions of Mr. Monckton no longer appeared over&s;trained; <HI>one year's income</HI> was already demanded, the annuity and the country hou&s;e might next be required: &s;he rejoiced, however, that thus wi&s;ely forwarned, &s;he was not liable to &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;he determined, be their en|treaties or repre&s;entations what they might, to be immovably &s;teady in her purpo&s;e of leaving them the next morning.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he could not but grieve at &s;uffering the whole burthen of this clamorous impo|&s;ition to fall upon the &s;oft-hearted Mr. Ar|nott, who&s;e inability to re&s;i&s;t &s;olicitation made him &s;o unequal to &s;u&s;taining its weight: but when Mrs. Harrel was again able to go on with her account, &s;he heard, to her infinite &s;urpri&s;e, that all application to her brother had proved fruitle&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"He will not hear me,"</Q> continued Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and he never was deaf to me before! &s;o
<PB N="109" REF="108">
now I have lo&s;t my only and la&s;t re&s;ource, my brother him&s;elf gives me up, and there is no one el&s;e upon earth who will a&s;&s;i&s;t me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With plea&s;ure, with readine&s;s, with joy,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould you find a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from me, were it to you alone it were given; but to &s;upply fewel for the very fire that is con&s;uming you&mdash;no, no, my whole heart is hardened again&s;t gaming and game&s;ters, and neither now or ever will I &s;uffer any con&s;ideration to &s;often me in their favour."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel only an&s;wered by tears and lamentations; and Cecilia, who&s;e ju&s;tice &s;hut not out compa&s;&s;ion, having now de|clared her purpo&s;ed firmne&s;s, again attempt|ed to &s;ooth her, entreating her not to give way to &s;uch immoderate grief, &s;ince better pro&s;pects might ari&s;e from the very gloom now before her, and a &s;hort time &s;pent in &s;olitude and oeconomy, might enable her to return to her native land with recovered happine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I &s;hall never return!"</Q> cried &s;he, weeping, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall die, I &s;hall break my heart before I have been bani&s;hed a month! Oh Mi&s;s Beverley, how happy are you! able to &s;tay where you plea&s;e,&mdash;rich,&mdash;rol|ling in wealth which you do not want,&mdash;of which had we but <HI>one</HI> year's income only,
<PB N="110" REF="109">
all this mi&s;ery would be over, and we might &s;tay in our dear, dear country!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;truck by a hint that &s;o nearly bordered upon reproach, and offended by &s;eeing the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever doing enough, while any thing remained to be done, forbore not without difficulty en|quiring what next was expected from her, and whether any part of her fortune might be guarded, without giving room for &s;ome cen&s;ure! but the deep affliction of Mrs. Harrel &s;oon removed her re&s;entment, and &s;carcely thinking her, while in a &s;tate of &s;uch wretchedne&s;s, an&s;werable for what &s;he &s;aid, after a little recollection, &s;he mildly replied <Q REND="inline">"As affluence is all comparative, you may at pre&s;ent think I have more than my &s;hare: but the time is only this moment pa&s;t, when your own &s;ituation &s;eemed as &s;ubject to the envy of others as mine may be now. My future de&s;tiny is yet unde|termined, and the occa&s;ion I may have for my fortune is unknown to my&s;elf; but whether I po&s;&s;e&s;s it in peace or in turbul|ence, whether it proves to me a ble&s;&s;ing or an injury, &s;o long as I can call it my own, I &s;hall always remember with alacrity the claim upon that and upon me which early friend&s;hip has &s;o ju&s;tly given Mrs. Harrel. Yet permit me, at the &s;ame time, to add, that I do not hold my&s;elf &s;o entirely inde|pendent
<PB N="111" REF="110">
as you may probably &s;uppo&s;e me. I have not, it is true, any Relations to call me to account, but re&s;pect for their memo|ry &s;upplies the place of their authority, and I cannot, in the di&s;tribution of the fortune which has devolved to me, forbear &s;ome|times con&s;idering how they would have wi&s;hed it &s;hould be &s;pent, and always re|membering that what was acquired by in|du&s;try and labour, &s;hould never be di&s;&s;ipat|ed in idlene&s;s and vanity. Forgive me for thus &s;peaking to the point; you will not find me le&s;s friendly to your&s;elf, for this frankne&s;s with re&s;pect to your &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P>Tears were again the only an&s;wer of Mrs. Harrel; yet Cecilia, who pitied the weak|ne&s;s of her mind, &s;tayed by her with the mo&s;t patient kindne&s;s till the &s;ervants an|nounced dinner. She then declared &s;he would not go down &s;tairs: but Cecilia &s;o &s;trongly repre&s;ented the danger of awaken|ing &s;u&s;picion in the &s;ervants, that &s;he at la&s;t prevailed with her to make her appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel was already in the parlour, and enquiring for Mr. Arnott, but was told by the &s;ervants he had &s;ent word he had another engagement. Sir Robert Floyer al&s;o kept away, and, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her arrival in town, Cecilia dined with no other company than the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">
Mrs. Harrel could eat nothing; Cecilia, merely to avoid creating &s;urpri&s;e in the &s;er|vants, forbore following her example; but Mr. Harrel eat much as u&s;ual, talked all dinner-time, was extremely civil to Cecilia, and di&s;covered not by his manners the lea&s;t alteration in his affairs.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants were gone, he de&s;ired his wife to &s;tep for a moment with him into the library. They &s;oon returned, and then Mr. Harrel, after walking in a di&s;ordered manner about the room, rang the bell, and ordered his hat and cane, and as he took them, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"If this fails&mdash;"</Q> and, &s;topping &s;hort, without &s;peaking to his wife, or even bowing to Cecilia, he ha&s;tily went out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel told Cecilia that he had merely called her to know the event of her two petitions, and had heard her double failure in total &s;ilence. Whither he was now gone it was not ea&s;y to conjecture, nor what was the new re&s;ource which he &s;till &s;eemed to think worth trying; but the manner of his quitting the hou&s;e, and the threat implied by <HI>if this fails,</HI> contributed not to le&s;&s;en the grief of Mrs. Harrel, and gave to Cecilia her&s;elf the utmo&s;t alarm.</P>
<P>They continued together till tea-time, the &s;ervants having been ordered to admit no company. Mr. Harrel him&s;elf then re|turned,
<PB N="113" REF="112">
and returned, to the amazement of Cecilia, accompanied by Mr. Marriot.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ented that young man to both the ladies as a gentleman who&s;e acquaintance and friend&s;hip he was very de&s;irous to cul|tivate. Mrs. Harrel, too much ab&s;orbed in her own affairs to care about any other, &s;aw his entrance with a momentary &s;urpri&s;e, and then thought of it no more: but it was not &s;o with Cecilia, who&s;e better under|&s;tanding led her to deeper reflection.</P>
<P>Even the vi&s;its of Mr. Marriot but a few weeks &s;ince Mr. Harrel had prohibited, yet he now introduced him into his hou&s;e with particular di&s;tinction; he came back too him&s;elf in admirable &s;pirits, enlivened in his countenance, and re&s;tored to his good humour. A change &s;o extraordinary both in conduct and di&s;po&s;ition, convinced her that &s;ome change no le&s;s extraordinary of circum&s;tance mu&s;t previou&s;ly have happen|ed: what that might be it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to divine, but the le&s;&s;ons &s;he had re|ceived from Mr. Monckton led her to &s;u&s;|picions of the darke&s;t kind.</P>
<P>Every part of his behaviour &s;erved &s;till further to confirm them; he was civil even to exce&s;s to Mr. Marriot; he gave orders aloud not to be at home to Sir Robert Floy|er; he made his court to Cecilia with unu|&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity, and he took every method in
<PB N="114" REF="113">
his power to procure opportunity to her ad|mirer of addre&s;&s;ing and approaching her.</P>
<P>The young man, who &s;eemed <HI>enamoured even to madne&s;s,</HI> could &s;carce refrain not merely from pro&s;tration to the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, but to Mr. Harrel him&s;elf for per|mitting him to &s;ee her. Cecilia, who not without &s;ome concern perceived a fondne&s;s &s;o fruitle&s;s, and who knew not by what arts or with what views Mr. Harrel might think proper to encourage it, determined to take all the means that were in her own power towards giving it immediate control. She behaved, therefore, with the utmo&s;t re&s;erve, and the moment tea was over, though ear|ne&s;tly entreated to remain with them, &s;he re|tired to her own room, without making any other apology than coldly &s;aying &s;he could not &s;tay.</P>
<P>In about an hour Mrs. Harrel ran up &s;tairs to her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"a little re&s;pite is now granted me! Mr. Harrel &s;ays he &s;hall &s;tay another day; he &s;ays, too, one &s;ingle thou&s;and pound would now make him a new man."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia returned no an&s;wer; &s;he conjec|tured &s;ome new deceit was in agitation to rai&s;e money, and &s;he feared Mr. Marriot was the next dupe to be played upon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, therefore, with a look of
<PB N="115" REF="114">
the utmo&s;t di&s;appointment, left her, &s;aying &s;he would &s;end for her brother, and once more try if he had yet any remaining regard for her.</P>
<P>Cecilia re&s;ted quiet till eleven o'clock, when &s;he was &s;ummoned to &s;upper: &s;he found Mr. Marriot &s;till the only gue&s;t, and that Mr. Arnott made not his appearance.</P>
<P>She now re&s;olved to publi&s;h her re&s;olu|tion of going the next morning to St. James's-&s;quare. As &s;oon, therefore, as the &s;ervants withdrew, &s;he enquired of Mr. Harrel if he had any commands with Mr. or Mrs. Delvile, as &s;he &s;hould &s;ee them the next morning, and purpo&s;ed to &s;pend &s;ome time with them.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, with a look of much alarm, a&s;ked if &s;he meant the whole day.</P>
<P>Many days, &s;he an&s;wered, and probably &s;ome months.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel exclaimed her &s;urpri&s;e aloud, and Mr. Harrel looked agha&s;t: while his new young friend ca&s;t upon him a glance of reproach and re&s;entment, which fully con|vinced Cecilia he imagined he had procur|ed him&s;elf a title to an ea&s;ine&s;s of inter|cour&s;e and frequency of meeting which this intelligence de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Cecilia, thinking after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, no other ceremony on her part was nece&s;|&s;ary but that of &s;imply &s;peaking her inten|tion,
<PB N="116" REF="115">
then aro&s;e and returned to her own room.</P>
<P>She acquainted her maid that &s;he was go|ing to make a vi&s;it to Mrs. Delvile, and gave her directions about packing up her clothes, and &s;ending for a man in the morn|ing to take care of her books.</P>
<P>This employment was &s;oon interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Harrel, who de&s;ir|ing to &s;peak with her alone, when the maid was gone, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Beverley, can you indeed be &s;o barbarous as to leave me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I entreat you, Mrs. Harrel,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ave both your&s;elf and me any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. I have delayed this removal very long, and I can now delay it no longer."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel then flung her&s;elf upon a chair in the bittere&s;t &s;orrow, declaring &s;he was utterly undone; that Mr. Harrel had declared he could not &s;tay even an hour in England if &s;he was not in his hou&s;e; that he had already had a violent quarrel with Mr. Marriot upon the &s;ubject; and that her brother, though &s;he had &s;ent him the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties, would not come near her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, tired of vain attempts to offer comfort, now urged the warme&s;t expo&s;tula|tions again&s;t her oppo&s;ition, &s;trongly repre|&s;enting the real nece&s;&s;ity of her going abroad, and the unpardonable weakne&s;s of wi&s;hing
<PB N="117" REF="116">
to continue &s;uch a life as &s;he now led, ad|ding debt to debt, and hoarding di&s;tre&s;s upon di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel then, though rather from compul&s;ion than conviction, declared &s;he would agree to go, if &s;he had not a dread of ill u&s;age; but Mr. Harrel, &s;he &s;aid, had behaved to her with the utmo&s;t brutality, calling her the cau&s;e of his ruin, and threat|ening that if &s;he procured not this thou&s;and pound before the en&s;uing evening, &s;he &s;hould be treated as &s;he de&s;erved for her extrava|gance and folly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Does he think, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia with the utmo&s;t indignation, <Q REND="inline">"that I am to be frightened through your fears into what compliances he plea&s;es?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"no; his expectations are all from my brother. He &s;urely thought that when I &s;upplicated and pleaded to him, he would do what I wi&s;h|ed, for &s;o he always did formerly, and &s;o once again I am &s;ure he would do now, could I but make him come to me, and tell him how I am u&s;ed, and tell him that if Mr. Harrel takes me abroad in this humour, I verily think in his rage he will half mur|der me."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who well knew &s;he was her&s;elf the real cau&s;e of Mr. Arnott's re&s;i&s;tance, now felt her re&s;olution waver, internally re|proaching
<PB N="118" REF="117">
her&s;elf with the &s;ufferings of his &s;i&s;ter; alarmed, however, for her own con|&s;tancy, &s;he earne&s;tly be&s;ought Mrs. Harrel to go and compo&s;e her&s;elf for the night, and promi&s;ed to deliberate what could be done for her before morning.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel complied; but &s;carce was her own re&s;t more broken than that of Ce|cilia, who, though extremely fatigued with a whole night's watching, was &s;o perturbed in her mind &s;he could not clo&s;e her eyes. Mrs. Harrel was her earlie&s;t, and had once been her deare&s;t friend; &s;he had deprived her by her own advice of her cu&s;tomary re|fuge in her brother; to refu&s;e, therefore, a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her &s;eemed cruelty, though to deny it to Mr. Harrel was ju&s;tice: &s;he en|deavoured, therefore, to make a compromi&s;e between her judgment and compa&s;&s;ion, by re&s;olving that though &s;he would grant no|thing further to Mr. Harrel while he re|mained in London, &s;he would contribute from time to time both to his nece&s;&s;ities and comfort, when once he was e&s;tabli&s;hed el&s;ewhere upon &s;ome plan of prudence and oeconomy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A PERSECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning by five o'clock Mrs. Harrel came into Cecilia's room to know the re&s;ult of her deliberation; and Cecilia, with that graceful readine&s;s which accompanied all her kind offices, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured her the thou&s;and pound &s;hould be her own, if &s;he would con&s;ent to &s;eek &s;ome quiet retreat, and receive it in &s;mall &s;ums, of fifty or one hundred pounds at a time, which &s;hould be carefully tran&s;mitted, and which, by being delivered to her&s;elf, might &s;ecure better treatment from Mr. Harrel, and be a motive to revive his care and af|fection.</P>
<P>She flew, much delighted, with this pro|po&s;al to her hu&s;band; but pre&s;ently, and with a dejected look, returning, &s;aid Mr. Harrel prote&s;ted he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;et out without fir&s;t receiving the money. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall go my&s;elf, therefore,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"to my brother after breakfa&s;t, for he will not, I &s;ee, unkind as he is grown, come to me; and if I do not &s;ucceed with him, I believe I &s;hall never come back!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">
To this Cecilia, offended and di&s;appoint|ed, an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for Mr. Arnott, but for my&s;elf I have done!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel then left her, and &s;he aro&s;e to make immediate preparations for her re|moval to St. James's-&s;quare, whither, with all the &s;peed in her power, &s;he &s;ent her books, her trunks, and all that belonged to her.</P>
<P>When &s;he was &s;ummoned down &s;tairs, &s;he found, for the fir&s;t time, Mr. Harrel breakfa&s;ting at the &s;ame table with his wife: they &s;eemed mutually out of hu|mour and comfortle&s;s, nothing hardly was &s;poken, and little was &s;wallowed: Mr. Harrel, however, was civil, but his wife was totally &s;ilent, and Cecilia the whole time was planning how to take her leave.</P>
<P>When the tea things were removed, Mr. Harrel &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"You have not, I hope, Mi&s;s Beverley, quite determined upon this &s;trange &s;cheme?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I have, Sir,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"and already I have &s;ent my clothes."</Q></P>
<P>At this information he &s;eemed thunder|&s;truck; but, after &s;omewhat recovering, &s;aid with much bitterne&s;s <Q REND="inline">"Well, madam, at lea&s;t may I reque&s;t you will &s;tay here till the evening?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he coolly, <Q REND="inline">"I am going in&s;tantly."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="120">
<Q REND="inline">"And will you not,"</Q> &s;aid he, with yet greater a&s;perity, <Q REND="inline">"amu&s;e your&s;elf fir&s;t with &s;eeing bailiffs take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hou&s;e, and your friend Pri&s;cilla follow me to Jail?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mr. Harrel!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, with uplifted hands, <Q REND="inline">"is this a que&s;tion, is this behaviour I have me|rited!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no,!"</Q> cried he with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould I once think that way&mdash;"</Q> then ri&s;ing and &s;triking his forehead, he walked about the room.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel aro&s;e too, and weeping vio|lently went away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you at lea&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, when &s;he was gone, <Q REND="inline">"till your affairs are &s;ettled, leave Pri&s;cilla with me? When I go into my own hou&s;e, &s;he &s;hall accompany me, and mean time Mr. Arnott's I am &s;ure will gladly be open to her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he de&s;erves no &s;uch indulgence; &s;he has not any rea|&s;on to complain, &s;he has been as negligent, as profu&s;e, as expen&s;ive as my&s;elf; &s;he has practi&s;ed neither oeconomy nor &s;elf-denial, &s;he has neither thought of me nor my af|fairs, nor is &s;he now afflicted at any thing but the lo&s;s of that affluence &s;he has done her be&s;t towards dimini&s;hing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All recrimination,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"were

<P><Q REND="inline">"Con&s;olation and kindne&s;s,"</Q> cried he, with abruptne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"are out of the que&s;|tion.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My removal!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;hudder|ing, <Q REND="inline">"good heaven, and how can my remo|val be of &s;uch dreadful con&s;equence?</Q></P>

<P>He then left the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia now was again a coward! In vain &s;he called to her &s;upport the advice, the prophe&s;ies, the cautions of Mr. Monkton,
<PB N="123" REF="122">
in vain &s;he recollected the impo&s;itions &s;he had already &s;een practi&s;ed, for neither the warnings of her coun&s;ellor, nor the le&s;|&s;ons of her own experience, were proofs a|gain&s;t the terrors which threats &s;o de&s;perate in&s;pired: and though more than once &s;he determined to fly at all events from a ty|ranny he had &s;o little right to u&s;urp, the mere remembrance of the words <HI>if you &s;tay not till night I will not live,</HI> robbed her of all courage; and however long &s;he had prepared her&s;elf for this very attack, when the moment arrived, its power over her mind was too &s;trong for re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>While this conflict between fear and re&s;olution was &s;till undecided, her &s;ervant brought her the following letter from Mr. Arnott.</P>

<P>Determined to obey tho&s;e commands which you had the goodne&s;s to honour me with, I have ab&s;ented my&s;elf from town till Mr. Harrel is &s;ettled; for though I am as &s;en&s;ible of your wi&s;dom as of your beauty, I find my&s;elf too weak to bear the di&s;tre&s;s of my unhappy &s;i&s;ter, and therefore I run from the &s;ight, nor &s;hall any letter or me&s;|&s;age follow me, unle&s;s it comes from Mi&s;s
<PB N="124" REF="123">
Beverley her&s;elf, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould in future refu&s;e the only favour I dare pre&s;ume to &s;olicit, that of &s;ometimes deigning to ho|nour with her directions</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The mo&s;t humble and devoted of her &s;ervants, J. ARNOTT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In the mid&s;t of her apprehen&s;ions for her&s;elf and her own intere&s;t, Cecilia could not forbear rejoicing that Mr. Arnott, at lea&s;t, had e&s;caped the pre&s;ent &s;torm: yet &s;he was certain it would fall the more heavily upon her&s;elf, and dreaded the &s;ight of Mrs. Harrel after the &s;hock which this flight would occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her expectations were but too quickly fulfilled: Mrs. Harrel in a &s;hort time after ru&s;hed wildly into the room, calling out <Q REND="inline">"My brother is gone! he has left me for ever! Oh &s;ave me, Mi&s;s Beverley, &s;ave me from abu&s;e and in&s;ult!"</Q> And &s;he wept with &s;o much violence &s;he could utter nothing more.</P>
<P>Cecilia, quite tortured by this per&s;ecu|tion, faintly a&s;ked what &s;he could do for her?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Send,"</Q> cried &s;he <Q REND="inline">"to my brother, and be&s;eech him not to abandon me! &s;end to him, and conjure him to advance this thou|&s;and pound!&mdash;the chai&s;e is already order|ed,
<PB N="125" REF="124">
&mdash;Mr. Harrel is fixed upon going,&mdash;yet he &s;ays without that money we mu&s;t both &s;tarve in a &s;trange land,&mdash;O &s;end to my cruel brother! he has left word that nothing mu&s;t follow him that does not come from you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For the world, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"would I not baffle his di&s;cretion! indeed you mu&s;t &s;ubmit to your fate, indeed Mrs. Harrel you mu&s;t endeavour to bear it better."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, &s;hedding a flood of tears, declared &s;he would try to follow her advice, but again be&s;ought her in the utmo&s;t agony to &s;end after her brother, prote&s;ting &s;he did not think even her life would be &s;afe in making &s;o long a journey with Mr. Harrel in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind: his character, &s;he &s;aid, was totally changed, his gaiety, good humour and &s;prightline&s;s were turned into roughne&s;s and moro&s;ene&s;s, and, &s;ince his great lo&s;&s;es at play, he was grown &s;o fierce and furious, that to oppo&s;e him even in a trifle, rendered him quite out|rageous in pa&s;&s;ion</P>
<P>Cecilia, though truly concerned, and al|mo&s;t melted, yet refu&s;ed to interfere with Mr. Arnott, and even thought it but ju&s;tice to acknowledge &s;he had advi&s;ed his retreat.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you have been &s;o cruel?"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, with &s;till encrea&s;ing vio|lence
<PB N="126" REF="125">
of &s;orrow, <Q REND="inline">"to rob me of my only friend, to deprive me of my Brother's affec|tion, at the very time I am forced out of the kingdom, with a hu&s;band who is ready to murder me, and who &s;ays he hates the &s;ight of me, and all becau&s;e I cannot get him this fatal, fatal money!&mdash;O Mi&s;s Be|verley, how could I have thought to have had &s;uch an office from you?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was beginning a ju&s;tification, when a me&s;&s;age came from Mr. Harrel, de&s;iring to &s;ee his wife immediately.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, in great terror, ca&s;t her|&s;elf at Cecilia's feet, and clinging to her knees, called out <Q REND="inline">"I dare not go to him! I dare not go to him! he wants to know my &s;ucce&s;s, and when he hears my brother is run away, I am &s;ure he will kill me!&mdash;Oh Mi&s;s Beverley, how could you &s;end him away? how could you be &s;o inhuman as to leave me to the rage of Mr. Harrel?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and trembling her&s;elf, conjured her to ri&s;e and be con&s;oled; but Mrs. Harrel, weak and frightened, could only weep and &s;upplicate; <Q REND="inline">"I don't a&s;k you,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to give the money your|&s;elf, but only to &s;end for my brother, that he may protect me, and beg Mr Harrel not to treat me &s;o cruelly,&mdash;con&s;ider but what a long, long journey I am going to make! con&s;ider how often you u&s;ed to &s;ay you
<PB N="127" REF="126">
would love me for ever! con&s;ider you have robbed me of the tendere&s;t brother in the world!&mdash;Oh Mi&s;s Beverley, &s;end for him back, or be a &s;i&s;ter to me your&s;elf, and let not your poor Pri&s;cilla leave her native land without help or pity?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, wholly overcome, now knelt too, and embracing her with tears, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Oh Pri&s;cilla, plead and reproach no more! what you wi&s;h &s;hall be yours,&mdash;I will &s;end for your brother,&mdash;I will do what you plea&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now you are my friend indeed!"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"let me but <HI>&s;ee</HI> my brother, and his heart will yield to my di&s;tre&s;s, and he will &s;often Mr. Harrel by giving his un|happy &s;i&s;ter this parting bounty."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then took a pen in her hand to write to Mr. Arnott; but &s;truck almo&s;t in the &s;ame moment with a notion of treachery in calling him from a retreat which her own coun&s;el had made him &s;eek, profe&s;&s;ed|ly to expo&s;e him to a &s;upplication which from his pre&s;ent &s;ituation might lead him to ruin, &s;he ha&s;tily flung it from her, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"No, excellent Mr. Arnott, I will not &s;o unworthily betray you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you, Mi&s;s Beverley, can you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t la&s;t,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"be &s;o barba|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ous as to retract?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="127">
<Q REND="inline">"No, my poor Pri&s;cilla,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;o cruelly di&s;appoint you; my pity &s;hall however make no &s;ufferer but my&s;elf,&mdash;I cannot &s;end for Mr. Arnott,&mdash;from me you mu&s;t have the money, and may it an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which it is given, and re&s;tore to you the tenderne&s;s of your hu&s;band, and the peace of your own heart!"</Q></P>
<P>Pri&s;cilla, &s;carce waiting to thank her, flew with this intelligence to Mr. Harrel; who with the &s;ame impetuo&s;ity, &s;carce waiting to &s;ay he was glad of it, ran him&s;elf to bring the Jew from whom the money was to be procured. Every thing was &s;oon &s;ettled, Cecilia had no time for retracting, and re|pentance they had not the delicacy to regard: again, therefore, &s;he &s;igned her name for paying the principal and intere&s;t of another 1000<HI>l.</HI> within ten days after &s;he was of age: and having taken the money, &s;he accom|panied Mr. and Mrs. Harrel into another room. Pre&s;enting it then with an affecting &s;olemnity to Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"accept, Pri&s;cil|la,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">this irrefragable mark of the &s;incerity of my friend&s;hip: but &s;uffer me at the &s;ame time to tell you, it is the la&s;t to &s;o con&s;iderable an amount I ever mean to offer; receive it, therefore, with kindne&s;s, but u&s;e it with di&s;cretion."</Q></P>
<P>She then embraced her, and eager now
<PB N="129" REF="128">
to avoid acknowledgement, as before &s;he had been to e&s;cape importunities, &s;he left them together.</P>
<P>The &s;oothing recompen&s;e of &s;uccouring benevolence, followed not this gift, nor made amends for this lo&s;s: perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s, regret and re&s;entment, accompa|nied the donation, and re&s;ted upon her mind; &s;he feared &s;he had done wrong; &s;he was certain Mr. Monkton would blame her; he knew not the per&s;ecution &s;he &s;uffered, nor would he make any allowance for the threats which alarmed, or the intreaties which melted her.</P>
<P>Far other had been her feelings at the genero&s;ity &s;he exerted for the Hills; no doubts then tormented her, and no repent|ance embittered her beneficence. Their worth was without &s;u&s;picion, and their mi&s;|fortunes were not of their own &s;eeking; the po&s;t in which they had been &s;tationed they had never de&s;erted, and the poverty into which they had &s;unk was accidental and unavoidable.</P>
<P>But here, every evil had been wantonly incurred by vanity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hamele&s;sly followed by inju&s;tice and fraud: the di&s;turbance of her mind only increa&s;ed by reflection, for when the rights of the creditors with their injuries occurred to her, &s;he enquired of her&s;elf by what title
<PB N="130" REF="129">
or equity, &s;he had &s;o liberally a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. Harrel in eluding their claims, and fly|ing the puni&s;hment which the law would inflict.</P>
<P>Startled by this con&s;ideration, &s;he mo&s;t &s;everely reproached her&s;elf for a compliance of which &s;he had &s;o lightly weighed the con&s;equences, and thought with the utmo&s;t di&s;may, that while &s;he had flattered her&s;elf &s;he was merely indulging the dictates of humanity, &s;he might perhaps be accu&s;ed by the world as an abettor of guile and in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And yet,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"whom can I e&s;&s;entially have injured but my&s;elf? would his creditors have been benefitted by my refu&s;al? had I braved the execution of his dreadful threat, and quitted his hou&s;e before I was wrought upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, would his &s;uicide have le&s;&s;ened their lo&s;&s;es, or &s;ecured their demands? even if he had no intention but to intimidate me, who will be wronged by my enabling him to go abroad, or who would be better paid were he &s;eized and confined? All that remains of his &s;hat|tered fortune may &s;till be claimed, though I have &s;aved him from a lingering impri|&s;onment, de&s;perate for him&s;elf and his wife, and u&s;ele&s;s for tho&s;e he has plundered."</Q></P>
<P>And thus, now &s;oothed by the purity of her intentions, and now unea&s;y from the
<PB N="131" REF="130">
rectitude of her principles, &s;he alternately rejoiced and repined at what &s;he had done.</P>
<P>At dinner Mr. Harrel was all civility and good humour. He warmly thanked Cecilia for the kindne&s;s &s;he had &s;hewn him, and gaily added, <Q REND="inline">"You &s;hould be ab&s;olved from all the mi&s;chief you may do for a twelvemonth to come, in reward for the pre|&s;ervation from mi&s;chief which you have this day effected."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The pre&s;ervation,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"will I hope be for many days. But tell me, &s;ir, exactly, at what time I may acquaint Mrs. Delvile I &s;hall wait upon her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"by eight o'|clock; perhaps by nine; you will not mind half an hour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly not;"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, unwil|ling by di&s;puting about a trifle to dimini&s;h his &s;atisfaction in her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She wrote, therefore, another note to Mrs. Delvile, de&s;iring &s;he would not expect her till near ten o'clock, and promi&s;ing to account and apologize for the&s;e &s;eeming caprices when &s;he had the honour of &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the afternoon &s;he &s;pent wholly in exhorting Mrs. Harrel to &s;hew more fortitude, and conjuring her to &s;tudy no|thing while abroad but oeconomy, prudence and hou&s;ewifry: a le&s;&s;on how hard for the thoughtle&s;s and negligent Pri&s;cilla! &s;he
<PB N="132" REF="131">
heard the advice with repugnance, and only an&s;wered it with helple&s;s complaints that &s;he knew not how to &s;pend le&s;s money than &s;he had always done.</P>
<P>After tea, Mr. Harrel, &s;till in high &s;pirits, went out, entreating Cecilia to &s;tay with Pri&s;cilla till his return, which he promi&s;ed &s;hould be early.</P>
<P>Nine o'clock, however, came, and he did not appear; Cecilia then grew anxious to keep her appointment with Mrs. Delvile; but ten o'clock al&s;o came, and &s;till Mr. Harrel was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>She then determined to wait no longer, and rang her bell for her &s;ervant and chair: but when Mrs. Harrel de&s;ired to be infor|med the moment that Mr. Harrel returned, the man &s;aid he had been come home more than half an hour.</P>
<P>Much &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he enquired where he was.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In his own room, madam, and gave orders not to be di&s;turbed."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who was not much plea&s;ed at this account, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to &s;tay a few minutes longer; and, fearing &s;ome new evil, &s;he was going to &s;end him a me&s;&s;age, by way of knowing how he was employed, when he came him&s;elf into the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, ladies,"</Q> he cried in a hurrying manner, <Q REND="inline">"who is for Vauxhall?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="132">
<Q REND="inline">"Vauxhall!"</Q> repeated Mrs. Harrel, while Cecilia, &s;taring, perceived in his face a look of perturbation that extremely alar|med her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"we have no time to lo&s;e. A hackney coach will &s;erve us; we won't wait for our own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you then given up going abroad?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no; where can we go from half &s;o well? let us live while we live! I have ordered a chai&s;e to be in waiting there. Come, let's be gone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fir&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"let me wi&s;h you both good night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you not go with me?</Q> "cried Mrs Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"how can I go to Vauxhall alone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are not alone,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but if I go, how am I to return?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She &s;hall return with you,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">if you de&s;ire it; you &s;hall return together."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, &s;tarting up in rapture, called out <Q REND="inline">"Oh Mr. Harrel, will you indeed leave me in England?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he reproachfully, <Q REND="inline">"if you will make a better friend than you have made a wife, and if Mi&s;s Beverley is content to take charge of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What can all this mean?"</Q> exclaimed Ce|cilia,
<PB N="134" REF="133">
<Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible you can be &s;erious? Are you really going your&s;elf, and will you &s;uffer Mrs. Harrel to remain?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"and I will."</Q></P>
<P>Then ringing the bell, he ordered a hackney coach.</P>
<P>Mrs Harrel was &s;carce able to breathe for extacy, nor Cecilia for amazement: while Mr. Harrel, attending to neither of them, walked for &s;ome time &s;ilently about the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how,"</Q> cried Cecilia at la&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"can I po&s;&s;ibly go? Mrs. Delvile mu&s;t already be a&s;toni&s;hed at my delay, and if I di&s;ap|point her again &s;he will hardly receive me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O make not any difficulties,</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel in an agony; <Q REND="inline">"if Mr. Harrel will let me &s;tay, &s;ure you will not be &s;o cruel as to oppo&s;e him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But why,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould either of us go to Vauxhall? &s;urely that is no place for a parting &s;o melancholy."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant then came in, and &s;aid the hackney coach was at the door.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, &s;tarting at the &s;ound, called out, <Q REND="inline">"come, what do we wait for? if we go not immediately, we may be prevented."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then again wi&s;hed them good night, prote&s;ting &s;he could fail Mrs. Delvile no longer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, half wild at this refu&s;al,
<PB N="135" REF="134">
conjured her in the mo&s;t frantic manner, to give way, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Oh cruel! cruel! to deny me this la&s;t reque&s;t! I will kneel to you day and night,"</Q> &s;inking upon the ground before her, <Q REND="inline">"and I will &s;erve you as the humble&s;t of your &s;laves, if you will but be kind in this la&s;t in&s;tance, and &s;ave me from bani&s;hment and mi&s;ery!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh ri&s;e, Mrs. Harrel,"</Q> cried Cecilia, a&s;hamed of her pro&s;tration, and &s;hocked by her vehemence, <Q REND="inline">"ri&s;e and let me re&s;t!&mdash;it is painful to me to refu&s;e, but to comply for ever in defiance of my judgment&mdash;Oh Mrs. Harrel, I know no longer what is kind or what is cruel, nor have I known for &s;ome time pa&s;t right from wrong, nor good from evil!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel impetuou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"I wait not another minute!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Leave her then with me!"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"I will perform my promi&s;e, Mr. Arnott will I am &s;ure hold his to be &s;acred, &s;he &s;hall now go with him, &s;he &s;hall here|after come to me,&mdash;leave her but behind, and depend upon our care."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t take care of her my&s;elf. I &s;hall not carry her abroad with me, but the only legacy I can leave her, is a warning which I hope &s;he will remember for ever. <HI>You,</HI> how|ever, need not go."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="135">
<Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">leave me at Vauxhall, and yet leave me alone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What of that?"</Q> cried he with fierce|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"do you not de&s;ire to be left? have you any regard for me? or for any thing upon earth but your&s;elf! cea&s;e the&s;e vain clamours, and come, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, this moment."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with a violent oath, he de|clared he would be detained no longer, and approached in great rage to &s;eize her; Mrs. Harrel &s;hrieked aloud, and the terrified Cecilia exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"If indeed you are to part to night, part not thus dreadfully!&mdash;ri&s;e, Mrs. Harrel, and comply!&mdash;be recon|ciled, be kind to her, Mr. Harrel!&mdash;and I will go with her my&s;elf,&mdash;we will all go together!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, more gently yet with the utmo&s;t emotion, <Q REND="inline">"why &s;hould <HI>you</HI> go!&mdash;<HI>you</HI> want no warning! <HI>you</HI> need no terror!&mdash;better far had you fly us, and my wife when I am &s;et out may find you."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, &s;uffered her not to recede; and Cecilia, though half di&s;|tracted by the &s;cenes of horror and per|plexity in which &s;he was perpetually en|gaged, ordered her &s;ervant to acquaint Mrs. Delvile &s;he was again compelled to defer waiting upon her.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="136">
Mr. Harrel then hurried them both into the coach, which he directed to Vauxhall.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray write to me when you are landed,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, who now relea&s;ed from her per&s;onal apprehen&s;ions, began to feel &s;ome for her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>He made not any an&s;wer. She then a&s;ked to what part of France he meant to go: but &s;till he did not reply: and when &s;he urged him by a third que&s;tion, he told her in a rage to torment him no more.</P>
<P>During the re&s;t of the ride not another word was &s;aid; Mrs. Harrel wept, her hu&s;band guarded a gloomy &s;ilence, and Cecilia mo&s;t unplea&s;antly pa&s;&s;ed her time between anxious &s;u&s;picions of &s;ome new &s;cheme, and a terrified wonder in what all the&s;e tran&s;actions would terminate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. A MAN OF BUSINESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they entered Vauxhall, Mr. Harrel endeavoured to di&s;mi&s;s his moro&s;ene&s;s, and affecting his u&s;ual gaiety, &s;truggled to recover his &s;pirits; but the effort was vain, he could neither talk nor look like him&s;elf, and though from time to time he re&s;umed his air of wonted levity, he could not &s;upport it, but drooped and hung his head in evident de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>He made them take &s;everal turns in the mid&s;t of the company, and walked &s;o fa&s;t that they could hardly keep pace with him, as if he hoped by exerci&s;e to re&s;tore his vivacity; but every attempt failed, he &s;unk and grew &s;adder, and muttering between his teeth <Q REND="inline">"this is not to be borne!"</Q> he ha&s;tily called to a waiter to bring him a bottle of champagne.</P>
<P>Of this he drank gla&s;s after gla&s;s, not|with&s;tanding Cecilia, as Mrs. Harrel had not courage to &s;peak, entreated him to forbear. He &s;eemed, however, not to hear her; but when he had drunk what he thought nece&s;&s;ary to revive him, he con|veyed
<PB N="139" REF="138">
them into an unfrequented part of the garden, and as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight of all but a few &s;tragglers, he &s;ud|denly &s;topt, and, in great agitation, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"my chai&s;e will &s;oon be ready, and I &s;hall take of you a long farewell!&mdash;all my affairs are unpropitious to my &s;peedy return&mdash;the wine is now mounting into my head, and perhaps I may not be able to &s;ay much by and by. I fear I have been cruel to you, Pri&s;cilla, and I begin to wi&s;h I had &s;pared you this parting &s;cene; yet let it not be bani&s;hed your remembrance, but think of it when you are tempted to &s;uch mad folly as has ruined us."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel wept too much to make any an&s;wer; and turning from her to Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"Oh Madam,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to <HI>you,</HI> indeed, I dare not &s;peak! I have u&s;ed you mo&s;t unworthily, but I pay for it all! I I a&s;k you not to pity or forgive me, I know it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould do either."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried the &s;oftened Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"it is not impo&s;&s;ible, I do both at this mo|ment, and I hope&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not hope,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"be not &s;o angelic, for I cannot bear it! bene|volence like yours &s;hould have fallen into worthier hands. But come, let us return to the company. My head grows giddy,
<PB N="140" REF="139">
but my heart is &s;till heavy; I mu&s;t make them more fit companions for each other."</Q></P>
<P>He would then have hurried them back; but Cecilia, endeavouring to &s;top him, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"You do not mean, I hope, to call for more wine?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not?"</Q> cried he, with affected &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"what, &s;hall we not be merry be|fore we part? Yes, we will all be merry, for if we are not, how &s;hall we part at all?&mdash;Oh not without a &s;truggle!&mdash;"</Q> Then, &s;topping, he pau&s;ed a moment, and ca&s;ting off the ma&s;k of levity, &s;aid in accents the mo&s;t &s;olemn <Q REND="inline">"I commit this packet to <HI>you,</HI>"</Q> giving a &s;ealed parcel to Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"had I written it later, its contents had been kinder to my wife, for now the hour of &s;e|paration approaches, ill will and re&s;entment &s;ub&s;ide. Poor Pri&s;cilla!&mdash;I am &s;orry&mdash;but you will &s;uccour her, I am &s;ure you will,&mdash;Oh had I known you my&s;elf before this in|fatuation&mdash;bright pattern of all goodne&s;s!&mdash;but I was devoted,&mdash;a ruined wretch be|fore ever you entered my hou&s;e; unworthy to be &s;aved, unworthy that virtues &s;uch as yours &s;hould dwell under the &s;ame roof with me! But come,&mdash;come now, or my re&s;olu|tion will waver, and I &s;hall not go at la&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what is this packet?"</Q> cried Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"and why do you give it to me?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="140">
<Q REND="inline">"No matter, no matter, you will know by and by;&mdash;the chai&s;e waits, and I mu&s;t gather courage to be gone."</Q></P>
<P>He then pre&s;&s;ed forward, an&s;wering nei|ther to remon&s;trance nor intreaty from his frightened companions.</P>
<P>The moment they returned to the cover|ed walk, they were met by Mr. Marriot; Mr. Harrel, &s;tarting, endeavoured to pa&s;s him; but when he approached, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"you have &s;ent, Sir, no an&s;wer to my let|ter!"</Q> he &s;topt, and in a tone of forced po|litene&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, but I &s;hall an&s;wer it to-morrow, and to-night I hope you will do me the honour of &s;upping with me."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Marriot, looking openly at Cecilia as his inducement, though evidently re|garding him&s;elf as an injured man, he&s;itated a moment, yet accepted the invitation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;upper?"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"what here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;upper?"</Q> repeated Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and how are we to get home?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Think not of that the&s;e two hours,"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"come, let us look for a box."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then grew quite urgent with him to give up a &s;cheme which mu&s;t keep them &s;o late, and Mrs. Harrel repeatedly exclaim|ed <Q REND="inline">"Indeed people will think it very odd to &s;ee us here without any party:"</Q> but he heeded them not, and perceiving at &s;ome
<PB N="142" REF="141">
di&s;tance Mr. Morrice, he called out to him to find them a box; for the evening was very plea&s;ant, and the gardens were &s;o much crowded that no accommodation was un|&s;eized.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried Morrice, with his u&s;ual readine&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I'll get you one if I turn out ten old Aldermen &s;ucking cu&s;tards."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t after he was gone, a fat, &s;leek, vul|gar-looking man, dre&s;&s;ed in a bright purple coat, with a deep red wai&s;tcoat, and a wig bulging far from his head with &s;mall round curls, while his plump face and per&s;on an|nounced plenty and good living, and an air of defiance &s;poke the fullne&s;s of his pur&s;e, &s;trutted boldly up to Mr. Harrel, and ac|co&s;ting him in a manner that &s;hewed &s;ome diffidence of his reception, but none of his right, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Sir your humble &s;ervant."</Q> And made a bow fir&s;t to him, and then to the ladies.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir yours,"</Q> replied Mr. Harrel &s;corn|fully, and without touching his hat he walk|ed quick on.</P>
<P>His fat acquaintance, who &s;eemed but little di&s;po&s;ed to be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ended with impunity, in&s;tantly replaced his hat on his head, and with a look that implied <HI>I ll fit you for this!</HI> put his hands to his &s;ides, and following him, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I mu&s;t make bold to beg the favour of exchanging a few words with you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="142">
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"come to me to-morrow, and you &s;hall exchange as many as you plea&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing like the time pre&s;ent, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the man; <Q REND="inline">"as for to-morrow, I believe it intends to come no more; for I have heard of it any time the&s;e three years. I mean no reflections, Sir, but let every man have his right. That's what I &s;ay, and that's my notion of things."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, with a violent execration, a&s;ked what he meant by dunning him at &s;uch a place as Vauxhall?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One place, Sir,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"is as good as another place; for &s;o as what one does is good, 'tis no matter for where it may be. A <HI>man of bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> never wants a counter if he can meet with a joint-&s;tool. For my part, I'm all for a clear con&s;cience, and no bills without receipts to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if you were all for broken bones,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"I would oblige you with them without delay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried the man, equally provok|ed, <Q REND="inline">"this is talking quite out of character, for as to broken bones, there's ne'er a per|&s;on in all England, gentle nor &s;imple, can &s;ay he's a right to break mine, for I'm not a per&s;on of that &s;ort, but a man of as good property as another man; and there's ne'er
<PB N="144" REF="143">
a cu&s;tomer I have in the world that's more his own man than my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s me, Mr. Hob&s;on,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"don't follow us in this manner! If we meet any of our acquain|tance they'll think us half crazy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, again taking off his hat, <Q REND="inline">"if I'm treated with proper re&s;pect, no man will behave more generous than my&s;elf; but if I'm affronted, all I can &s;ay is, it may go harder with &s;ome folks than they think for."</Q></P>
<P>Here a little mean-looking man, very thin, and almo&s;t bent double with perpe|tual cringing, came up to Mr. Hob&s;on, and pulling him by the &s;leeve, whi&s;pered, yet loud enough to be heard, <Q REND="inline">"It's &s;urprize|able to me, Mr. Hob&s;on, you can behave &s;o out of the way! For my part, perhaps I've as much my due as another per&s;on, but I dares to &s;ay I &s;hall have it when it's con|venient, and I'd &s;corn for to mi&s;le&s;t a gen|tleman when he's taking his plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s me,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall we do now? here's all Mr. Harrel's creditors coming upon us!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do?"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, re-a&s;&s;uming an air of gaiety, <Q REND="inline">"why give them all a &s;upper, to be &s;ure. Come, gentlemen, will you favour me with your company to &s;up|per?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="144">
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, &s;omewhat &s;oftened by this unexpected invitation, <Q REND="inline">"I've &s;upped this hour and more, and had my gla&s;s too, for I'm as willing to &s;pend my money as another man; only what I &s;ay is this, I don't chu&s;e to be cheated, for that's lo&s;ing one's &s;ub&s;tance, and getting no credit; however, as to drinking another gla&s;s, or &s;uch a matter as that, I'll do it with all the plea&s;ure in life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And as to me,"</Q> &s;aid the other man, who&s;e name was Simkins, and who&s;e head almo&s;t touched the ground by the pro|foundne&s;s of his reverence, <Q REND="inline">I can't upon no account think of taking the liberty; but if I may ju&s;t &s;tand without, I'll make bold to go &s;o far as ju&s;t for to drink my humble duty to the ladies in a cup of cyder."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you mad, Mr. Harrel, are you mad!"</Q> cried his wife, <Q REND="inline">"to think of a&s;king &s;uch people as the&s;e to &s;upper? what will every body &s;ay? &s;uppo&s;e any of our ac|quaintance &s;hould &s;ee us? I am &s;ure I &s;hall die with &s;hame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mad!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"no, not mad but merry. O ho, Mr. Morrice, why have you been &s;o long? what have you done for us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice, return|ing with a look &s;omewhat le&s;s elated than he had &s;et out, <Q REND="inline">"the gardens are &s;o full, there is not a box to be had: but I hope we &s;hall
<PB N="146" REF="145">
get one for all that; for I ob&s;erved one of the be&s;t boxes in the garden, ju&s;t to the right there, with nobody in it but that gen|tleman who made me &s;pill the tea-pot at the Pantheon. So I made an apology, and told him the ca&s;e; but he only &s;aid <HI>humph?</HI> and <HI>hay?</HI> &s;o then I told it all over again, but he &s;erved me ju&s;t the &s;ame, for he never &s;eems to hear what one &s;ays till one's ju&s;t done, and then he begins to recollect one's &s;peak|ing to him; however, though I repeated it all over and over again, I could get nothing from him but ju&s;t that <HI>humph?</HI> and <HI>hay?</HI> but he is &s;o remarkably ab&s;ent, that I dare &s;ay if we all go and &s;it down round him, he won't know a word of the matter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Won't he?"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"have at him, then!"</Q></P>
<P>And he followed Mr. Morrice, though Cecilia, who now half &s;u&s;pected that all was to end in a mere idle frolic, warmly joined her remon&s;trances to tho&s;e of Mrs. Harrel, which were made with the utmo&s;t, but with fruitle&s;s earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, who was &s;eated in the middle of the box, was lolloping upon the table with his cu&s;tomary ea&s;e, and picking his teeth with his u&s;ual inattention to all about him. The intru&s;ion, however, of &s;o large a party, &s;eemed to threaten his in&s;en&s;ibility with unavoidable di&s;turbance; though ima|gining they meant but to look in at the
<PB N="147" REF="146">
box, and pa&s;s on, he made not at their fir&s;t approach any alteration in his attitude or employment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"See, ladies,"</Q> cried the officious Mor|rice, <Q REND="inline">"I told you there was room; and I am &s;ure this gentleman will be very happy to make way for you, if it's only out of good-nature to the waiters, as he is neither eating nor drinking, nor doing any thing at all. So if you two ladies will go in at that &s;ide, Mr. Harrel and that other gentleman,"</Q> pointing to Mr. Marriot, <Q REND="inline">"may go to the other, and then I'll &s;it by the ladies here, and tho&s;e other two gentlemen&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Meadows, rai&s;ing him&s;elf from his reclining po&s;ture, and &s;taring Morrice in the face, gravely &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What's all this, Sir!"</Q></P>
<P>Morrice, who expected to have arranged the whole party without a que&s;tion, and who under&s;tood &s;o little of modi&s;h airs as to &s;u&s;pect neither affectation nor trick in the ab&s;ence of mind and indolence of manners which he ob&s;erved in Mr. Meadows, was utterly amazed by this interrogatory, and &s;taring him&s;elf in return, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you &s;eemed &s;o thoughtful&mdash;I did not think&mdash;I did not &s;uppo&s;e you would have taken any notice of ju&s;t a per&s;on or two coming into the box."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did not you, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Meadows
<PB N="148" REF="147">
very coldly, <Q REND="inline">"why then now you do, per|haps you'll be &s;o obliging as to let me have my own box to my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>And then again he returned to his favou|rite po&s;ition.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, bowing; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I did not mean to di&s;turb you: for you &s;eemed &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that I'm &s;ure I did not much believe you would have &s;een us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, &s;trutting forward, <Q REND="inline">"if I may &s;peak my opinion, I &s;hould think, as you happen to be quite alone, a little agreeable company would be no &s;uch bad thing. At lea&s;t that's my notion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if I might take the liberty,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;mooth tongued Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"for to put in a word, I &s;hould think the be&s;t way would be, if the gentleman has no petick|lar objection, for me ju&s;t to &s;tand &s;ome|where hereabouts, and &s;o, when he's had what he's a mind to, be ready for to pop in at one &s;ide, as he comes out at the t'other; for if one does not look pretty 'cute &s;uch a full night as this, a box is whipt away be|fore one knows where one is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, no,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel impa|tiently, <Q REND="inline">"let us neither &s;up in this box nor in any other; let us go away entirely."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed we mu&s;t! indeed we ought!"</Q>
<PB N="149" REF="148">
cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"it is utterly improper we &s;hould &s;tay; pray let us be gone immedi|ately."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel paid not the lea&s;t regard to the&s;e reque&s;ts; but Mr. Meadows, who could no longer &s;eem uncon&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;ed, did him&s;elf &s;o much violence as to ari&s;e, and a&s;k if the ladies would be &s;eated.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;aid &s;o!"</Q> cried Morrice triumph|antly, <Q REND="inline">"I was &s;ure there was no gentleman but would be happy to accommodate two &s;uch ladies!"</Q></P>
<P>The ladies, however, far from happy in being &s;o accommodated, again tried their utmo&s;t influence in per&s;uading Mr. Harrel to give up this &s;cheme; but he would not hear them, he in&s;i&s;ted upon their going into the box, and, extending the privilege which Mr. Meadows had given, he invited with|out ceremony the whole party to follow.</P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, though he &s;eemed to think this a very extraordinary encroachment, had already made &s;uch an effort from his ge|neral languor in the repul&s;e he had given to Morrice, that he could exert him&s;elf no fur|ther; but after looking around him with mingled vacancy and contempt, he again &s;eated him&s;elf, and &s;uffered Morrice to do the honours without more oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Morrice, but too happy in the office, placed Cecilia next to Mr. Meadows, and
<PB N="150" REF="149">
would have made Mr. Marriot her other neighbour, but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon not being parted from Mrs. Harrel, and therefore, as he cho&s;e to &s;it al&s;o by that lady him&s;elf, Mr. Marriot was obliged to follow Mr. Harrel to the other &s;ide of the box: Mr. Hob&s;on, without further invitation, placed him&s;elf comfortably in one of the corners, and Mr. Simkins, who &s;tood mode&s;tly for &s;ome time in another, finding the further encouragement for which he waited was not likely to arrive, dropt quietly into his &s;eat without it.</P>
<P>Supper was now ordered, and while it was preparing Mr. Harrel &s;at totally &s;ilent; but Mr. Meadows thought proper to force him&s;elf to talk with Cecilia, though &s;he could well have di&s;pen&s;ed with &s;uch an ex|ertion of his politene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you like this place, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I hardly know,&mdash;I never was here before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No wonder! the only &s;urpri&s;e is that any body can come to it at all. To &s;ee a &s;et of people walking after nothing! &s;trol|ling about without view or object! 'tis &s;trange! don't you think &s;o, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,&mdash;I believe &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;carce hearing him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O it gives me the vapours, the hor|rors,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee what poor creatures
<PB N="151" REF="150">
we all are! taking plea&s;ure even from the privation of it! forcing our&s;elves into ex|erci&s;e and toil, when we might at lea&s;t have the indulgence of &s;itting &s;till and repo|&s;ing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Sir,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"don't you like walking?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Walking?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I know no|thing &s;o humiliating: to &s;ee a rational be|ing in &s;uch mechanical motion! with no knowledge upon what principles he pro|ceeds, but plodding on, one foot before another, without even any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which is fir&s;t, or how either&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> interrupted Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you won't take it ami&s;s if I make bold to tell my opinion, for my way is this, let every man &s;peak his maxim! But what I &s;ay as to this matter, is this, if a man mu&s;t always be &s;topping to con&s;ider what foot he is &s;tanding upon, he had need have little to do, being the right does as well as the left, and the left as well as the right. And that, Sir, I think is a fair argument."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows deigned no other an&s;wer to this &s;peech than a look of contempt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fancy, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"you are fond of riding, for all your good hor&s;emen like nothing el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Riding!"</Q> exclaimed Mr. Meadows, <Q REND="inline">"Oh barbarous! Wre&s;tling and boxing
<PB N="152" REF="151">
are polite arts to it! tru&s;ting to the di&s;cre|tion of an animal le&s;s intellectual than our|&s;elves! a &s;udden &s;pring may break all our limbs, a &s;tumble may fracture our &s;culls! And what is the inducement? to get melt|ed with heat, killed with fatigue, and co|vered with du&s;t! mi&s;erable infatuation!&mdash;Do you love riding, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, very well, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am glad to hear it,"</Q> cried he, with a vacant &s;mile; <Q REND="inline">"you are quite right; I am entirely of your opinion."</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Simkins now, with a look of much perplexity, yet ri&s;ing and bowing, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I don't mean, Sir, to be &s;o rude as to put in my oar, but if I did not take you wrong, I'm &s;ure ju&s;t now I thought you &s;eemed for to make no great 'count of rid|ing, and yet now, all of the &s;udden, one would think you was a &s;peaking up for it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why Sir,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"if you neither like riding nor walking, you can have no plea&s;ure at all but only in &s;itting."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sitting!"</Q> repeated Mr. Meadows, with a yawn, <Q REND="inline">"O wor&s;e and wor&s;e! it di&s;|pirits me to death! it robs me of all fire and life! it weakens circulation, and de|&s;troys ela&s;ticity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray then, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"do you like any better to &s;tand?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;tand? O intolerable! the mo&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="152">
unmeaning thing in the world! one had bet|ter be made a mummy!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, pray Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob|&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"let me a&s;k the favour of you to tell us what it is you <HI>do</HI> like?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, though he &s;tared him full in the face, began picking his teeth without making any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee, Mr. Hob&s;on,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Sim|kins, <Q REND="inline">"the gentleman has no mind for to tell you; but if I may take the liberty ju&s;t to put in, I think if he neither likes walk|ing, nor riding, nor &s;itting, nor &s;tanding, I take it he likes nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"but here comes &s;upper, and I hope you will like that. Pray Sir, may I help you to a bit of this ham?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, not &s;eeming to hear him, &s;uddenly, and with an air of extreme weari|ne&s;s, aro&s;e, and without &s;peaking to any body, abruptly made his way out of the box.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel now, &s;tarting from the gloomy reverie into which he had &s;unk, un|dertook to do the honours of the table, in|&s;i&s;ting with much violence upon helping every body, calling for more provi&s;ions, and &s;truggling to appear in high &s;pirits and good humour.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Captain Are&s;by, who
<PB N="154" REF="153">
was pa&s;&s;ing by the box, &s;topt to make his compliments to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a concour&s;e!"</Q> he cried, ca&s;ting up his eyes with an expre&s;&s;ion of half-dying fatigue, <Q REND="inline">"are you not <HI>accabl&eacute;?</HI> for my part, I hardly re&s;pire. I have really hardly ever had the honour of being &s;o <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We can make very good room, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"if you chu&s;e to come in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, ob&s;equiou&s;|ly &s;tanding up, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure the gentleman will be very welcome to take my place, for I did not mean for to &s;it down, only ju&s;t to look agreeable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the Cap|tain: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be quite <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> if I de|range any body."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I don't offer you my place, becau&s;e I take it for granted if you had a mind to come in, you would not &s;tand upon ceremony; for what I &s;ay is, let every man &s;peak his mind, and then we &s;hall all know how to conduct our&s;elves. That's my way, and let any man tell me a better!"</Q></P>
<P>The Captain, after looking at him with a &s;urpri&s;e not wholly unmixt with horror, turned from him without making any an|&s;wer, and &s;aid to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"And how long, ma'am, have you tried this petrifying place"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="154">
<Q REND="inline">"An hour,&mdash;two hours, I believe,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really? and nobody here! <HI>a&s;&s;ez de monde,</HI> but nobody here! a blank <HI>partout!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, getting out of the box that he might bow with more faci|lity, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly crave pardon for the li|berty, but if I under&s;tood right, you &s;aid &s;omething of a blank? pray, Sir, if I may be &s;o free, has there been any thing of the nature of a lottery, or a raffle, in the gar|den? or the like of that?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir!"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, regarding him from head to foot, <Q REND="inline">"I am quite <HI>a&s;&s;omm&eacute;</HI> that I cannot comprehend your allu&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, I a&s;k pardon,"</Q> &s;aid the man, bow|ing &s;till lower, <Q REND="inline">"I only thought if in ca&s;e it &s;hould not be above half a crown, or &s;uch a matter as that, I might perhaps &s;tretch a point once in a way."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain, more and more amazed, &s;tared at him again, but not thinking it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take any further notice of him, he enquired of Cecilia if &s;he meant to &s;tay late.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope not,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have al|ready &s;tayed later than I wi&s;hed to do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really!"</Q> &s;aid he, with an unmeaning &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Well, that is as horrid a thing as I have the <HI>malheur</HI> to know. For my part, I make it a principle not to &s;tay long in
<PB N="156" REF="155">
the&s;e &s;emi-barbarous places, for after a cer|tain time, they bore me to that degree I am quite <HI>abim&eacute;.</HI> I &s;hall, however, do <HI>mon po&s;|&s;ible</HI> to have the honour of &s;eeing you again."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with a &s;mile of yet greater in|&s;ipidity, he prote&s;ted he was <HI>reduced to de|&s;pair</HI> in leaving her, and walked on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, ma'am, if I may be &s;o bold,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"what countryman may that gentleman be?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An Engli&s;hman, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir,</Q> "&s;aid Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An Engli&s;hman, ma'am!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"why I could not under&s;tand one word in ten that came out of his mouth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"he has a mighty peticklar way of &s;peaking, for I'm &s;ure I thought I could have &s;worn he &s;aid &s;omething of a blank, or to that amount, but I could make nothing of it when I come to a&s;k him about it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let every man &s;peak to be under|&s;tood,"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"that's my notion of things: for as to all tho&s;e fine words that nobody can make out, I hold them to be of no u&s;e. Suppo&s;e a man was to talk in that manner when he's doing bu|&s;ine&s;s, what would be the up&s;hot? who'd under&s;tand what he meant? Well, that's the proof; what i'n't fit for bu&s;ine&s;s, i'n't of no value: that's my way of judging, and that's what I go upon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="156">
<Q REND="inline">"He &s;aid &s;ome other things,"</Q> rejoined Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"that I could not make out very clear, only I had no mind to a&s;k any more que&s;tions, for fear of his an&s;wering me &s;omething I &s;hould not under&s;tand: but as well as I could make it out, I thought I heard him &s;ay there was nobody here! what he could mean by that, I can't pre|tend for to gue&s;s, for I'm &s;ure the garden is &s;o &s;tock full, that if there was to come many more, I don't know where they could cram 'em."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I took notice of it at the time,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"for it i'n't many things are lo&s;t upon me; and, to tell you the truth, I thought he had been making pretty free with his bottle, by his &s;eeing no better."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bottle!"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"a mo&s;t excellent hint, Mr. Hob&s;on! come! let us all make free with the bottle!</Q></P>
<P>He then called for more wine, and in|&s;i&s;ted that every body &s;hould pledge him. Mr. Marriot and Mr. Morrice made not any objection, and Mr. Hob&s;on and Mr. Simkins con&s;ented with much delight.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel now grew extremely unruly, the wine he had already drunk being thus powerfully aided; and his next project was to make his wife and Cecilia follow his ex|ample. Cecilia, more incen&s;ed than ever to &s;ee no preparation made for his depar|ture,
<PB N="158" REF="157">
and all po&s;&s;ible pains taken to unfit him for &s;etting out, refu&s;ed him with equal firmne&s;s and di&s;plea&s;ure, and lamented, with the bittere&s;t &s;elf-reproaches, the con|&s;ent which had been forced from her to be pre&s;ent at a &s;cene of &s;uch di&s;order: but Mrs. Harrel would have oppo&s;ed him in vain, had not his attention been called off to another object. This was Sir Robert Floyer, who perceiving the party at &s;ome di&s;tance, no &s;ooner ob&s;erved Mr. Marriot in &s;uch company, than advancing to the box with an air of rage and defiance, he told Mr. Harrel he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> cried Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ay to me? and &s;o have I to &s;ay to you! Come among&s;t us and be merry! Here, make room, make way! Sit clo&s;e, my friends!"</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert, who now &s;aw he was in no &s;ituation to be rea&s;oned with, &s;tood for a moment &s;ilent; and then, looking round the box, and ob&s;erving Me&s;&s;rs. Hob&s;on and Simkins, he exclaimed aloud <Q REND="inline">"Why what queer party have you got into? who the d&mdash;l have you picked up here?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hob&s;on, who, to the importance of lately acquired wealth, now added the cou|rage of newly drunk Champaigne, &s;toutly kept his ground, without &s;eeming at all con&s;cious he was included in this interro|gation; but Mr. Simkins, who had &s;till his
<PB N="159" REF="158">
way to make in the world, and who&s;e habi|tual &s;ervility would have re&s;i&s;ted a larger draught, was ea&s;ily intimidated; he again, therefore &s;tood up, and with the mo&s;t cring|ing re&s;pect offered the Baronet his place: who, taking neither of the offer nor offerer the &s;malle&s;t notice, &s;till &s;tood oppo&s;ite to Mr. Harrel, waiting for &s;ome explanation.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, however, who now grew really incapable of giving any, only repeat|ed his invitation that he would make one among them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One among you?"</Q> cried he, angrily, and pointing to Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"why you don't fancy I'll &s;it down with a bricklayer?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A bricklayer?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"ay, &s;ure, and a ho&s;ier too; &s;it down, Mr. Simkins, keep your place, man!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Simkins mo&s;t thankfully bowed; but Mr. Hob&s;on, who could no longer avoid feeling the per&s;onality of this reflec|tion, boldly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you may &s;it down with a wor&s;e man any day in the week! I have done nothing I'm a&s;hamed of, and no man can &s;ay to me why did you &s;o? I don't tell you, Sir, what I'm worth; no one has a right to a&s;k; I only &s;ay three times five is fifteen! that's all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what the d&mdash;l, you impudent fellow,"</Q> cried the haughty Baronet, <Q REND="inline">"you don't pre&s;ume to mutter, do you?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159">
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, very hot|ly, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ha'n't put up with abu&s;e from no man! I've got a fair character in the world, and wherewithal to live by my own liking. And what I have is my own, and all I &s;ay is, let every one &s;ay the &s;ame, for that's the way to fear no man, and face the d&mdash;l."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by that, fellow?"</Q> cried Sir Robert.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fellow, Sir! this is talking no how. Do you think a man of &s;ub&s;tance, that's got above the world, is to be treated like a little &s;crubby apprentice? Let every man have his own, that's always my way of thinking; and this I can &s;ay for my&s;elf, I have as good a right to &s;hew my head where I plea&s;e as ever a member of parliament in all England: and I wi&s;h every body here could &s;ay as much."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert, fury &s;tarting into his eyes, was beginning an an&s;wer; but Mrs. Harrel with terror, and Cecilia with dignity, cal|ling upon them both to forbear, the Baro|not de&s;ired Morrice to relinqui&s;h his place to him, and &s;eating him&s;elf next to Mrs. Harrel, gave over the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Mean-while Mr. Simkins, hoping to in|gratiate him&s;elf with the company, advanc|ed to Mr. Hob&s;on, already cooled by find|ing him&s;elf unan&s;wered, and reproachfully &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Hob&s;on, if I may make &s;o free,
<PB N="161" REF="160">
I mu&s;t needs be bold to &s;ay I am quite a&s;hamed of you! a per&s;on of your &s;tanding and credit for to talk &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful! as if a gentleman had not a right to take a little plea&s;ure, becau&s;e he ju&s;t happens to owe you a little matters of money: fie, fie, Mr. Hob&s;on! I did not expect you to behave &s;o de&s;pi&s;eable!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"De&s;pi&s;eable!"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I'd &s;corn as much to do any thing de&s;|pi&s;eable as your&s;elf, or any thing mi&s;becom|ing of a gentleman; and as to coming to &s;uch a place as this may be, why I have no objection to it. All I &s;tand to is this, let every man have his due; for as to taking a little plea&s;ure, here I am, as one may &s;ay, doing the &s;ame my&s;elf; but where's the harm of that? who's a right to call a man to account that's clear of the world? Not that I mean to boa&s;t, nor nothing like it, but, as I &s;aid before, five times five is fifteen;&mdash;that's my cal|culation."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, who, during this debate, had &s;till continued drinking, regardle&s;s of all oppo&s;ition from his wife and Cecilia, now grew more and more turbulent: he in&s;i&s;ted that Mr. Simkins &s;hould return to his &s;eat, ordered him another bumper of champagne, and &s;aying he had not half
<PB N="162" REF="161">
company enough to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, de&s;ired Morrice to go and invite more.</P>
<P>Morrice, always ready to promote a fro|lic, mo&s;t chearfully con&s;ented; but when Cecilia, in a low voice, &s;upplicated him to bring no one back, with &s;till more readine&s;s he made &s;igns that he under&s;tood and would obey her.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel then began to &s;ing, and in &s;o noi&s;y and riotous a manner, that nobody approached the box without &s;topping to &s;tare at him; and tho&s;e who were new to &s;uch &s;cenes, not contented with merely looking in, &s;tationed them&s;elves at &s;ome di&s;tance before it, to ob&s;erve what was pa&s;&s;ing, and to contemplate with envy and admiration an appearance of mirth and enjoyment which they attributed to happi|ne&s;s and plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, &s;hocked to be &s;een in &s;uch mixed company, grew every in&s;tant more re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable; and Cecilia, half di&s;tracted to think how they were to get home, had pa&s;&s;ed all her time in making &s;ecret vows that if once again &s;he was deli|vered from Mr. Harrel &s;he would never &s;ee him more.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Floyer perceiving their mu|tual unea&s;ine&s;s, propo&s;ed to e&s;cort them home him&s;elf; and Cecilia, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="163" REF="162">
her aver&s;ion to him, was li&s;tening to the &s;cheme, when Mr. Marriot, who had been evidently provoked and di&s;concerted &s;ince the junction of the Baronet, &s;u&s;pecting what was pa&s;&s;ing, offered his &s;ervices al&s;o, and in a tone of voice that did not promi&s;e a very quiet acquie&s;cence in a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who, too ea&s;ily, in their looks, &s;aw all the eagerne&s;s of rivalry, now dreaded the con&s;equence of her deci&s;ion, and there|fore declined the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of either: but her di&s;tre&s;s was un&s;peakable, as there was not one per&s;on in the party to who&s;e care &s;he could commit her&s;elf, though the beha|viour of Mr. Harrel, which every moment grew more di&s;orderly, rendered the nece&s;|&s;ity of quitting him urgent and uncontroul|able.</P>
<P>When Morrice returned, &s;topping in the mid&s;t of his loud and violent &s;inging, he vehemently demanded what company he had brought him?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None at all, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice, looking &s;ignificantly at Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"I have really been &s;o unlucky as not to meet with any body who had a mind to come."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> an&s;wered he, &s;tarting up, <Q REND="inline">"I will &s;eek &s;ome for my&s;elf."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"O no, pray, Mr. Harrel, bring nobody el&s;e,"</Q> cried his wife. <Q REND="inline">"Hear us in pity,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and di&s;tre&s;s us no further."</Q>
<PB N="164" REF="163">
<Q REND="inline">"Di&s;tre&s;s you?"</Q> cried he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall I not bring you tho&s;e pretty girls? Yes, one more gla&s;s, and I will teach you to welcome them."</Q></P>
<P>And he poured out another bumper.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is &s;o in&s;upportable!"</Q> cried Cecilia, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"and I can remain here no longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is cruel indeed,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, bur&s;ting into tears; <Q REND="inline">did you only bring me here to in&s;ult me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!"</Q> cried he, &s;uddenly embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"by this parting ki&s;s!"</Q> then wildly jumping upon his &s;eat, he leapt over the table, and was out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Amazement &s;eized all who remained; Mrs. Harrel and Cecilia, indeed, doubted not but he was actually gone to the chai&s;e he had ordered; but the manner of his departure affrighted them, and his preced|ing behaviour had made them cea&s;e to ex|pect it: Mrs Harrel, leaning upon Cecilia, continued to weep, while &s;he, confounded and alarmed, &s;carce knew whether &s;he &s;hould &s;tay and con&s;ole her, or fly after Mr. Har|rel, whom &s;he feared had incapacitated him&s;elf from finding his chai&s;e, by the very method he had taken to gather courage for &s;eeking it.</P>
<P>This however, was but the apprehen&s;ion of a moment; another and a far more hor|rible one drove it from her imagination:
<PB N="165" REF="164">
for &s;carcely had Mr. Harrel quitted the box and their &s;ight, before their ears were &s;uddenly &s;truck with the report of a pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel gave a loud &s;cream, which was involuntarily echoed by Cecilia: every body aro&s;e, &s;ome with officious zeal to &s;erve the ladies, and others to ha&s;ten to the &s;pot whence the dreadful &s;ound proceeded.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Floyer again offered his &s;er|vices in conducting them home; but they could li&s;ten to no &s;uch propo&s;al: Cecilia, with difficulty refrained from ru&s;hing out her&s;elf to di&s;cover what was pa&s;&s;ing; but her dread of being followed by Mrs. Har|rel prevented her; they both, therefore, waited, expecting every in&s;tant &s;ome intel|ligence, as all but the Baronet and Mr. Marriot were now gone to &s;eek it.</P>
<P>Nobody, however, returned; and their terrors encrea&s;ed every moment: Mrs. Harrel wanted to run out her&s;elf, but Ce|cilia, conjuring her to keep &s;till, begged Mr. Marriot to bring them &s;ome account. Mr. Marriot, like the me&s;&s;engers who had preceded him, came not back: an in&s;tant &s;eemed an age, and Sir Robert Floyer was al&s;o entreated to procure information.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel and Cecilia were now left to them&s;elves, and their horror was too great for &s;peech or motion: they &s;tood clo&s;e to each other, li&s;tening to every &s;ound
<PB N="166" REF="165">
and receiving every po&s;&s;ible addition to their alarm, by the general confu&s;ion which they ob&s;erved in the gardens, in which, though both gentlemen and waiters were running to and fro, not a creature was walking, and all amu&s;ement &s;eemed forgotten.</P>
<P>From this dreadful &s;tate they were at length removed, though not relieved, by the &s;ight of a waiter, who, as he was pa&s;|&s;ing &s;hewed him&s;elf almo&s;t covered with blood! Mrs. Harrel vehemently called after him, demanding whence it came? <Q REND="inline">"From the gentleman, ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered he in ha&s;te, <Q REND="inline">"that has &s;hot him&s;elf,"</Q> and then ran on.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel uttered a piercing &s;cream, and &s;unk on the ground; for Cecilia, &s;huddering with horror, lo&s;t all her own &s;trength, and could no longer lend her any &s;upport.</P>
<P>So great at this time was the general con|fu&s;ion of the place, that for &s;ome minutes their particular di&s;tre&s;s was unknown, and their &s;ituation unnoticed; till at length an elderly gentleman came up to the box, and humanely offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Cecilia, pointing to her unfortunate friend, who had not fallen into a fainting fit, but merely from weakne&s;s and terror, accepted his help in rai&s;ing her. She was lifted up, however, without the &s;malle&s;t
<PB N="167" REF="166">
effort on her own part, and was only kept upon her &s;eat by being held there by the &s;tranger, for Cecilia, who&s;e whole frame was &s;haking, tried in vain to &s;u&s;tain her.</P>
<P>This gentleman, from the violence of their di&s;tre&s;s, began now to &s;u&s;pect its mo|tive, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid, madam, this unfortunate gentleman was &s;ome Relation to you?"</Q></P>
<P>Neither of them &s;poke, but their &s;ilence was &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is pity, madam,</Q> "he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;ome friend can't order him out of the crowd, and have him kept quiet till a &s;urgeon can be brought."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A &s;urgeon!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, reco|vering from one &s;urprize by the effect of another, <Q REND="inline">"is it then po&s;&s;ible he may be &s;aved?"</Q></P>
<P>And without waiting to have her que&s;tion an&s;wered, &s;he ran out of the box her&s;elf, flying wildly about the garden, and calling for help as &s;he flew, till &s;he found the hou&s;e by the entrance; and then, going up to the bar, <Q REND="inline">"Is a &s;urgeon &s;ent for?"</Q> &s;he ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"let a &s;urgeon be fetched in&s;tant|ly!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">A &s;urgeon, ma'am,"</Q> &s;he was an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"is not the gentleman dead?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, no, no!"</Q> &s;he cried; <Q REND="inline">"he mu&s;t be brought in; let &s;ome careful people go and bring him in."</Q> Nor would &s;he quit the bar, till two or three
<PB N="168" REF="167">
waiters were called, and received her or|ders. And then, eager to &s;ee them executed her&s;elf, &s;he ran, fearle&s;s of being alone, and without thought of being lo&s;t, towards the fatal &s;pot whither the crowd guided her. She could not, indeed, have been more &s;ecure from in&s;ult or mole&s;tation if &s;ur|rounded by twenty guards; for the &s;cene of de&s;peration and horror which many had witne&s;&s;ed, and of which all had heard the &s;ig|nal, engro&s;&s;ed the univer&s;al attention, and took, even from the mo&s;t idle and licen|tious, all &s;pirit for gallantry and amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>Here, while making vain attempts to penetrate through the multitude, that &s;he might &s;ee and her&s;elf judge the actual &s;itu|ation of Mr. Harrel, and give, if yet there was room for hope, &s;uch orders as would be&s;t conduce to his &s;afety and recovery, &s;he was met by Mr. Marriot, who entreated her not to pre&s;s forward to a &s;ight which he had found too &s;hocking for him&s;elf, and in&s;i&s;ted upon protecting her through the crowd.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If he is alive,"</Q> cried &s;he, refu&s;ing his aid, <Q REND="inline">"and if there is any chance he may be &s;aved, no &s;ight &s;hall be too &s;hocking to deter me from &s;eeing him properly at|tended."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All attendance,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"will
<PB N="169" REF="168">
be in vain: he is not indeed, yet dead, but his recovery is impo&s;&s;ible. There is a &s;urgeon with him already; one who hap|pened to be in the gardens, and he told me him&s;elf that the wound was inevitably mortal."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though greatly di&s;appointed, &s;till determined to make way to him, that &s;he might her&s;elf enquire if, in his la&s;t moments, there was any thing he wi&s;hed to communicate, or de&s;ired to have done: but, as &s;he &s;truggled to proceed, &s;he was next met and &s;topt by Sir Robert Floyer, who, forcing her back, acquainted her that all was over!</P>
<P>The &s;hock with which &s;he received this account, though unmixed with any ten|derne&s;s of regret, and re&s;ulting merely from general humanity, was yet &s;o violent as almo&s;t to overpower her. Mr. Harrel, indeed, had forfeited all right to her e&s;teem, and the unfeeling &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his whole behaviour had long provoked her re&s;ent|ment and excited her di&s;gu&s;t; yet a cata&s;|trophe &s;o dreadful, and from which &s;he had her&s;elf made &s;uch efforts to re&s;cue him, filled her with &s;o much horror, that, turn|ing extremely &s;ick, &s;he was obliged to be &s;upported to the neare&s;t box, and &s;top there for hart&s;horn and water.</P>
<P>A few minutes, however, &s;ufficed to di|ve&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="169">
her of all care for her&s;elf, in the con|cern with which &s;he recollected the &s;ituation of Mrs. Harrel; &s;he ha&s;tened, therefore, back to her, attended by the Baronet and Mr. Marriot, and found her &s;till leaning upon the &s;tranger, and weeping aloud.</P>
<P>The fatal news had already reached her; and though all affection between Mr. Har|rel and her&s;elf had mutually &s;ub&s;ided from the fir&s;t two or three months of their mar|riage, a conclu&s;ion &s;o horrible to all con|nection between them could not be heard without &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s. Her temper, too, naturally &s;oft, retained not re&s;entment, and Mr. Harrel, now &s;eparated from her for ever, was only remembered as the Mr. Harrel who fir&s;t won her heart.</P>
<P>Neither pains nor tenderne&s;s were &s;pared on the part of Cecilia to con&s;ole her; who finding her utterly incapable either of acting or directing for her&s;elf, and knowing her at all times to be extremely helple&s;s, now &s;ummoned to her own aid all the &s;trength of mind &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and deter|mined upon this melancholy occa&s;ion, both to think and act for her widowed friend to the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of her abilities and power.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of her grief were over, &s;he prevailed with
<PB N="171" REF="170">
her to go to the hou&s;e, where &s;he was hu|manely offered the u&s;e of a quiet room till &s;he &s;hould be be better able to &s;et off for town.</P>
<P>Cecilia, having &s;een her thus &s;afely lodged, begged Mr. Marriot to &s;tay with her, and then, accompanied by the Baronet, returned her&s;elf to the bar, and de&s;iring the footman who had attended them to be cal|led, &s;ent him in&s;tantly to his late ma&s;ter, and proceeded next with great pre&s;ence of mind, to inquire further into the particulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to con&s;ult upon what was immediately to be done with the decea&s;ed: for &s;he thought it neither decent nor right to leave to chance or to &s;tran|gers the la&s;t duties which could be paid him.</P>
<P>He had lingered, &s;he found, about a quarter of an hour, but in a condition too dreadful for de&s;cription, quite &s;peechle&s;s, and, by all that could be judged, out of his &s;en&s;es; yet &s;o di&s;torted with pain, and wounded &s;o de&s;perately beyond any power of relief, that the &s;urgeon, who every in|&s;tant expected his death, &s;aid it would not be merely u&s;ele&s;s but inhuman, to remove him till he had breathed his la&s;t. He died, therefore, in the arms of this gen|tleman and a waiter.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="171">
<Q REND="inline">"A waiter!"</Q> cried Cecilia, reproachfully looking at Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"and was there no friend who for the few poor moments that remained had patience to &s;upport him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where would be the good,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"of &s;upporting a man in his la&s;t agonies.?"</Q></P>
<P>This unfeeling &s;peech &s;he attempted not to an&s;wer, but, &s;uffering neither her di&s;|like to him, nor her &s;cruples for her&s;elf, to interfere with the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;he de&s;ired to have his advice what was now be&s;t to be done."</P>
<P>Undertaker's men mu&s;t immediately, he &s;aid, be &s;ent for, to remove the body.</P>
<P>She then gave orders for that purpo&s;e, which were in&s;tantly executed.</P>
<P>Whither the body was to go was the next que&s;tion: Cecilia wi&s;hed the removal to be directly to the town-hou&s;e, but Sir Robert told her it mu&s;t be carried to the neare&s;t undertaker's, and kept there till it could be conveyed to town in a coffin.</P>
<P>For this, al&s;o, in the name of Mrs. Har|rel, &s;he gave directions. And then addre&s;|&s;ing her&s;elf to Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"You will now Sir, I hope, &s;he &s;aid, return to the fatal &s;pot, and watch by your late unfortunate friend till the proper people arrive to take charge of him?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="172">
<Q REND="inline">"And what good will that do?"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"had I not better watch by you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It will do good,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with fome &s;everity, <Q REND="inline">"to decency and to humanity; and &s;urely you cannot refu&s;e to &s;ee who is with him, and in what &s;ituation he lies, and whether he has met, from the &s;trangers with whom he was left, the tenderne&s;s and care which his friends ought to have paid him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you promi&s;e, then,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"not to go away till I come back? for I have no great ambition to &s;acrifice the liv|ing for the dead."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will promi&s;e nothing, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;hocked at his callous in&s;en&s;ibility; <Q REND="inline">"but if you refu&s;e this la&s;t poor office, I mu&s;t apply el&s;ewhere; and firmly I believe there is no other I can a&s;k who will a moment he&s;itate in complying."</Q></P>
<P>She then went back to Mrs. Harrel, leav|ing, however, an impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of Sir Robert, that made him no longer dare di&s;pute her commands.</P>
<P>Her next &s;olicitude was how they &s;hould return to town; they had no equipage of their own, and the only &s;ervant who came with them was employed in performing the la&s;t duties for his decea&s;ed ma&s;ter. Her fir&s;t intention was to order a hackney coach, but the deplorable &s;tate of Mrs. Harrel
<PB N="174" REF="173">
made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could take the &s;ole care of her, and the latene&s;s of the night, and their di&s;tance from home, gave her a dread invincible to going &s;o far without &s;ome guard or a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Mr. Mar|riot earne&s;tly de&s;ired to have the honour of conveying them to Portman-&s;quare in his own carriage, and notwith&s;tanding there were many objections to &s;uch a propo&s;al, the humanity of his behaviour upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and the evident veneration which accompanied his pa&s;&s;ion, joined to her encrea&s;ing aver&s;ion to the Baronet, from whom &s;he could not endure to receive the &s;malle&s;t obligation, determined her, after much perplexity and he&s;itation, to accept his offer.</P>
<P>She begged him, therefore, to immediate|ly order his coach, and, happy to obey her, he went out with that de&s;ign; but, in&s;tantly coming back, told her, in a low voice, that they mu&s;t wait &s;ome time long|er, as the Undertaker's people were then entering the garden, and if they &s;tayed not till the removal had taken place, Mrs. Harrel might be &s;hocked with the &s;ight of &s;ome of the men, or perhaps even meet the dead body.</P>
<P>Cecilia, thanking him for this con|&s;iderate precaution, readily agreed to defer &s;etting out; devoting, mean time, all
<PB N="175" REF="174">
her attention to Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e &s;orrow, though violent, forbad not con&s;olation. But before the garden was cleared, and the carriage ordered, Sir Robert returned; &s;aying to Cecilia, with an air of parading obedience which &s;eemed to claim &s;ome ap|plau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, your commands have been executed."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia made not any an&s;wer, and he pre&s;ently added <Q REND="inline">"Whenever you chu&s;e to go I will order up my coach."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>My</HI> coach, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Marriot, <Q REND="inline">"will be ordered when the ladies are ready, and I hope to have the honour my&s;elf of conducting them to town."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> cried the Baronet, <Q REND="inline">"that can never be; my long acquaintance with Mrs. Harrel gives me a prior right to at|tend her, and I can by no means &s;uffer any other per&s;on to rob me of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have nothing,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Marriot, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ay to that, Sir, but Mi&s;s Beverley her&s;elf has done me the honour to con&s;ent to make u&s;e of my carriage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, I think,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, extremely piqued, <Q REND="inline">"can never have &s;ent me out of the way in order to execute her own commands, merely to deprive me of the plea&s;ure of attending her and Mrs. Harrel home."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;omewhat alarmed, now &s;ought
<PB N="176" REF="175">
to le&s;&s;en the favour of her deci&s;ion, though &s;he adhered to it without wavering.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My intention,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"was not to confer, but to receive an obligation; and I had hoped, while Mr. Marriot a&s;&s;i&s;ted us, Sir Robert would be far more humanely em|ployed in taking charge of what we cannot &s;uperintend, and yet are infinitely more an|xious &s;hould not be neglected."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"is all done; and I hope, therefore, after &s;ending me upon &s;uch an errand, you don't mean to refu&s;e me the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you to town?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Robert,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, greatly di&s;|plea&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot argue with you now; I have already &s;ettled my plan, and I am not at lei&s;ure to re-con&s;ider it,"</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert bit his lips for a moment in angry &s;ilence; but not enduring to lo&s;e the victory to a young rival he de&s;pi&s;ed, he pre&s;ently &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If I mu&s;t talk no more about it to you, madam, I mu&s;t at lea&s;t beg leave to talk of it to this gentleman, and take the liberty to repre&s;ent to him&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, dreading how his &s;peech might be an&s;wered, prevented its being fi|ni&s;hed, and with an air of the mo&s;t &s;pirited dignity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;ir, that at a time &s;uch as this, you &s;hould not be wholly indifferent to a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">er &s;o frivolous? little indeed will be the plea&s;ure which our &s;oci|ety
<PB N="177" REF="176">
can afford! your di&s;pute however, has given it &s;ome importance, and therefore Mr. Marriot mu&s;t accept my thanks for his civility, and excu&s;e me for retracting my con&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>Supplications and remon&s;trances were, however, &s;till poured upon her from both, and the danger, the impo&s;&s;ibility that two ladies could go to town alone, in a hack|ney coach, and without even a &s;ervant, at near four o'clock in the morning, they mutually urged, vehemently entreating that &s;he would run no &s;uch hazard.</P>
<P>Cecilia was far other than in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e repre&s;entations: the danger, indeed, appeared to her &s;o formidable, that her inclination the whole time oppo&s;ed her re|fu&s;al; yet her repugnance to giving way to the overbearing Baronet, and her fear of his re&s;entment if &s;he li&s;tened to Mr. Mar|riot, forced her to be &s;teady, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw that her preference would prove the &s;ignal of a quarrel.</P>
<P>Innattentive, therefore, to their joint per&s;ecution, &s;he again deliberated by what po&s;&s;ible method &s;he could get home in &s;afety; but unable to devi&s;e any, &s;he at la&s;t re&s;ol|ved to make enquiries of the people in the bar, who had been extremely humane and civil, whether they could a&s;&s;i&s;t or
<PB N="178" REF="177">
coun&s;el her. She therefore de&s;ired the two gentlemen to take care of Mrs. Harrel, to which neither dared di&s;&s;ent, as both could not refu&s;e, and ha&s;tily ari&s;ing, went out of the room: but great indeed was her &s;urprize when, as &s;he was walking up to the bar, &s;he was addre&s;&s;ed by young Delvile!</P>
<P>Approaching her with that air of gravi|ty and di&s;tance which of late he had a&s;&s;umed in her pre&s;ence, he was beginning &s;ome &s;peech about his mother; but the in&s;tant the &s;ound of his voice reached Cecilia, &s;he joyfully cla&s;ped her hands, and eagerly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile!&mdash;O now we are &s;afe!&mdash;this is fortunate indeed!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Safe, Madam,"</Q> cried he a&s;toni&s;hed, <Q REND="inline">"yes I hope &s;o!&mdash;has any thing endangered your &s;afety?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no matter for danger,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"we will now tru&s;t our&s;elves with you, and I am &s;ure you will protect us."</Q></P>
<P>Protect you! repeated he again, and with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"yes, while I live!&mdash;but what is the matter?&mdash;why are you &s;o pale?&mdash;are you ill?&mdash;are you frightened?&mdash;what is the matter?"</Q></P>
<P>And lo&s;ing all coldne&s;s and re&s;erve, with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s he begged her to explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="178">
<Q REND="inline">"Do you not know,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what has happened? can you be here and not have heard it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heard what?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I am but this moment arrived: my mother grew un|ea&s;y that &s;he did not &s;ee you, &s;he &s;ent to your hou&s;e, and was told that you were not returned from Vauxhall; &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tances al&s;o alarmed her, and therefore, late as it was, I came hither my&s;elf. The in&s;tant I entered this place, I &s;aw you here. This is all my hi&s;tory; tell me now yours. Where is your party? where are Mr. and Mrs. Harrel?&mdash;Why are you alone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O a&s;k not!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot tell you!&mdash;take us but under your care, and you will &s;oon know all."</Q></P>
<P>She then hurried from him, and returning to Mrs. Harrel, &s;aid &s;he had now a convey|ance at once &s;afe and proper, and begged her to ri&s;e and come away.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, however, ro&s;e fir&s;t, each of them declaring he would him&s;elf attend them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;teadily, <Q REND="inline">"that trouble will now be &s;uperfluous: Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf has &s;ent for me, and her &s;on is now waiting till we join him."</Q></P>
<P>Amazement and di&s;appointment at this intelligence were vi&s;ible in the faces of them both: Cecilia waited not a &s;ingle que&s;tion, but finding &s;he was unable to &s;upport Mrs.
<PB N="180" REF="179">
Harrel, who rather &s;uffered her&s;elf to be carried than led, &s;he entru&s;ted her between them, and ran forward to enquire of Del|vile if his carriage was ready.</P>
<P>She found him with a look of horror that told the tale he had been hearing, li&s;|tening to one of the waiters: the moment &s;he appeared, he flew to her, and with the utmo&s;t emotion exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Amiable Mi&s;s Beverley! what a dreadful &s;cene have you witne&s;&s;ed! what a cruel ta&s;k have you nobly performed! &s;uch &s;pirit with &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s! &s;o much pre&s;ence of mind with &s;uch feel|ing!&mdash;but you are all excellence! human nature can ri&s;e no higher! I believe indeed you are its mo&s;t perfect ornament!"</Q></P>
<P>Prai&s;e &s;uch as this, &s;o unexpected, and delivered with &s;uch energy, Cecilia heard not without plea&s;ure, even at a moment when her whole mind was occupied by matters foreign to its peculiar intere&s;ts. She made, however, her enquiry about the carriage, and he told her that he had come in a hackney coach, which was waiting for him at the door.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel was now brought in, and little was the recompence her a&s;&s;i&s;tants re|ceived for their aid, when they &s;aw Cecilia &s;o contentedly engaged with young Delvile, who&s;e eyes were rivetted on her face, with an expre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t lively admiration:
<PB N="181" REF="180">
Each, however, then quitted the other, and ha&s;tened to the fair mourner; no time was now lo&s;t, Mrs. Harrel was &s;upported to the coach, Cecilia followed her, and Del|vile, jumping in after them, ordered the man to drive to Portman-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Sir Robert and Mr. Marriot, confounded though enraged, &s;aw their departure in pa&s;|&s;ive &s;ilence: the right of attendance they had &s;o tenaciou&s;ly denied to each other, here admitted not of di&s;pute: Delvile upon this occa&s;ion, appeared as the repre&s;enta|tive of his father, and his authority &s;eemed the authority of a guardian. Their only con&s;olation was that neither had yielded to the other, and all &s;pirit of altercation or revenge was &s;unk in their mutual mortifi|cation. At the petition of the waiters, from &s;ullen but proud emulation, they paid the expences of the night, and then throwing them&s;elves into their carriages, returned to their re&s;pective hou&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. A SOLUTION.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the ride to town, not mere|ly Cecilia, but Delvile him&s;elf attend|ed wholly to Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e grief as it became le&s;s violent, was more ea&s;y to be &s;oothed.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of this eventful night was however not yet over; when they came to Portman-&s;quare, Delvile eagerly called to the coachman not to drive up to the hou&s;e, and anxiou&s;ly begged Cecilia and Mrs. Harrel to &s;it &s;till, while he went out him&s;elf to make &s;ome enquiries. They were &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the reque&s;t, yet immediately con|&s;ented; but before he had quitted them, Davi&s;on, who was watching their return, came up to them with information that an execution was then in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h mi&s;ery was now opened for Mrs. Harrel, and fre&s;h horror and perplexity for Cecilia: &s;he had no longer, however, the whole weight either of thought or of con|duct upon her&s;elf; Delvile in her cares took the mo&s;t animated intere&s;t, and be&s;eeching
<PB N="183" REF="182">
her to wait a moment and appea&s;e her friend, he went him&s;elf into the hou&s;e to learn the &s;tate of the affair.</P>
<P>He returned in a few minutes, and &s;eem|ed in no ha&s;te to communicate what he had heard, but entreated them both to go im|mediately to St. James's-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Cecilia felt extremely fearful of offend|ing his father by the introduction of Mrs. Harrel: yet &s;he had nothing better to pro|po&s;e, and therefore, after a &s;hort and di&s;|&s;tre&s;&s;ed argument, &s;he complied.</P>
<P>Delvile then told her that the alarm of his mother, at which he had already hinted, proceeded from a rumour of this very mis|fortune, to which, though they knew not whether they might give credit, was owing the anxiety which at &s;o late an hour, had induced him to go to Vauxhall in &s;earch of her.</P>
<P>They gained admittance without any di&s;|turbance, as the &s;ervant of young Delvile had been ordered to &s;it up for his ma&s;ter. Cecilia much di&s;liked thus taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e in the night-time, though Del|vile, &s;olicitous to relieve her, de&s;ired &s;he would not wa&s;te a thought upon the &s;ub|ject, and making his &s;ervant &s;hew her the room which had been prepared for her re|ception, he begged her to compo&s;e her &s;pi|rits, and to comfort her friend, and pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="184" REF="183">
to acquaint his father and mother when they aro&s;e with what had happened, that &s;he might be &s;aved all pain from &s;ur|pri&s;e or curio&s;ity when they met.</P>
<P>This &s;ervice &s;he thankfully accepted, for &s;he dreaded, after the liberty &s;he had taken, to encounter the pride of Mr. Delvile with|out &s;ome previous apology, and &s;he feared &s;till more to &s;ee his lady without the &s;ame preparation, as her frequent breach of ap|pointment might rea&s;onably have offended her, and as her di&s;plea&s;ure would affect her more deeply.</P>
<P>It was now near &s;ix o'clock, yet the hours &s;eemed as long as they were melancholy till the family aro&s;e. They &s;ettled to remain quiet till &s;ome me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to them, but before any arrived, Mrs. Harrel, who was &s;eated upon the bed, wearied by fatigue and &s;orrow, cried her&s;elf to &s;leep like a child.</P>
<P>Cecilia rejoiced in &s;eeing this reprieve from affliction, though her keener &s;en&s;ations unfitted her from partaking of it; much indeed was the unea&s;ine&s;s which kept her awake; the care of Mrs. Harrel &s;eemed to devolve upon her&s;elf, the reception &s;he might meet from the Delviles was uncer|tain, and the horrible adventures of the night, refu&s;ed for a moment to quit her re|membrance.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock, a me&s;&s;age was brought
<PB N="185" REF="184">
from Mrs. Delvile, to know whether they were ready for breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel was &s;till a&s;leep, but Cecilia carried her own an&s;wer by ha&s;tening down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>In her way &s;he was met by young Del|vile, who&s;e air upon fir&s;t approaching her &s;poke him again prepared to addre&s;s her with the mo&s;t di&s;tant gravity: but almo&s;t the moment he looked at her, he forgot his purpo&s;e; her palene&s;s, the heavine&s;s of her eyes, and the fatigue of long watching be|trayed by her whole face, again &s;urpri&s;ed him into all the tenderne&s;s of anxiety, and he enquired after her health not as a com|pliment of civility, but as a que&s;tion in which his whole heart was mo&s;t deeply in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for his attention to her friend the night before, and then pro|ceeded to his mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, coming forward to meet her, removed at once all her fears of di&s;|plea&s;ure, and bani&s;hed all nece&s;&s;ity of apo|logy, by in&s;tantly embracing her, and warm|ly exclaiming <Q REND="inline">"Charming Mi&s;s Beverley! how &s;hall I ever tell you half the admira|tion with which I have heard of your con|duct! The exertion of &s;o much fortitude at a juncture when a weaker mind would have
<PB N="186" REF="185">
been overpowered by terror, and a heart le&s;s under the dominion of well-regulated prin|ciples, would have &s;ought only its own re|lief by flying from di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion, &s;hews &s;uch <HI>propriety of mind</HI> as can only re|&s;ult from the union of good &s;en&s;e with vir|tue. You are indeed a noble creature! I thought &s;o from the moment I beheld you; I &s;hall think &s;o, I hope, to the la&s;t that I live!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, penetrated with joy and grati|tude, felt in that in&s;tant the ample&s;t recom|pen&s;e for all that &s;he had &s;uffered, and for all that &s;he had lo&s;t. Such prai&s;e from Mrs. Delvile was alone &s;ufficient to make her happy; but when &s;he con&s;idered whence it &s;prung, and that the circum&s;tances with which &s;he was &s;o much &s;truck, mu&s;t have been related to her by her &s;on, her delight was augmented to an emotion the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;he could experience, from &s;eeing how high &s;he was held in the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who were highe&s;t in her own.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile then, with the utmo&s;t cor|diality, began to talk of her affairs, &s;aving her the pain of propo&s;ing the change of ha|bitation that now &s;eemed unavoidable, by an immediate invitation to her hou&s;e, which &s;he made with as much delicacy as if Mr. Harrel's had &s;till been open to her, and choice, not nece&s;&s;ity, had directed her re|moval.
<PB N="187" REF="186">
The whole family, &s;he told her, went into the country in two days, and &s;he hoped that a new &s;cene, with quietne&s;s and early hours, would re&s;tore both the bloom and &s;prightline&s;s which her late cares and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s had injured. And though &s;he very &s;eriou&s;ly lamented the ra&s;h action of Mr. Harrel, &s;he much rejoiced in the acqui|&s;ition which her own hou&s;e and happine&s;s would receive from her &s;ociety.</P>
<P>She next di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ituation of her widowed friend, and Cecilia produced the packet which had been entru&s;ted to her by her late hu&s;band. Mrs. Delvile advi&s;ed her to open it in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Arnott, and begged her to &s;end for any other of her friends &s;he might wi&s;h to &s;ee or con&s;ult, and to claim freely from her&s;elf whatever advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>And then, without waiting for Mr. Del|vile, &s;he &s;uffered her to &s;wallow a ha&s;ty breakfa&s;t, and return to Mrs. Harrel, whom &s;he had de&s;ired the &s;ervants to attend, as &s;he concluded that in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;he would not chu&s;e to make her appear|ance.</P>
<P>Cecilia, lightened now from all her own cares, more plea&s;ed than ever with Mrs. Delvile, and enchanted that at la&s;t &s;he was &s;ettled under her roof, went back with as
<PB N="188" REF="187">
much ability as inclination to give comfort to Mrs. Harrel. She found her but ju&s;t awaking, and &s;carce yet con&s;cious where &s;he was, or why not in her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As her powers of recollection returned, &s;he was &s;oothed with the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion by Cecilia, who in pur&s;uance of Mrs. Del|vile's advice, &s;ent her &s;ervant in &s;earch of Mr. Arnott, and in con&s;equence of her per|mi&s;&s;ion, wrote a note of invitation to Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, who was already in town, &s;oon arrived: his own man, whom he had left to watch the motions of Mr. Harrel, having early in the morning rode to the place of his retreat, with the melancholy tidings of the &s;uicide and execution.</P>
<P>Cecilia in&s;tantly went down &s;tairs to him. The meeting was extremely painful to them both. Mr. Arnott &s;everely blamed him|&s;elf for his flight, believing it had ha&s;tened the fatal blow, which &s;ome further &s;acri|fices might perhaps have eluded: and Ce|cilia half repented the advice &s;he had given him, though the failure of her own efforts proved the &s;ituation of Mr. Harrel too de&s;|perate for remedy.</P>
<P>He then made the tendere&s;t enquiries about his &s;i&s;ter, and entreated her to com|municate to him the minute&s;t particulars of the dreadful tran&s;action: after which, &s;he
<PB N="189" REF="188">
produced the packet, but neither of them had the courage to break the &s;eal; and concluding the contents would be no le&s;s than his la&s;t will, they determined &s;ome third per&s;on &s;hould be pre&s;ent when they opened it. Cecilia wi&s;hed much for Mr. Monckton, but as his being immediately found was uncertain, and the packet might con&s;i&s;t of orders which ought not to be de|layed, &s;he propo&s;ed, for the &s;ake of expe|dition, to call in Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott readily agreed, and &s;he &s;ent to beg a moment's audience with that gen|tleman.</P>
<P>She was de&s;ired to walk into the break|fa&s;t-room, where he was &s;itting with his lady and his &s;on.</P>
<P>Not &s;uch was now her reception as when &s;he entered that apartment before; Mr. Delvile looked di&s;plea&s;ed and out of hu|mour, and, making her a &s;tiff bow, while his &s;on brought her a chair, coldly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you are hurried, Mi&s;s Beverley, I will attend you directly; if not, I will fini&s;h my breakfa&s;t, as I &s;hall have but little time the re&s;t of the morning, from the concour&s;e of people upon bu&s;ine&s;s, who will crowd upon me till dinner, mo&s;t of whom will be extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed if I leave town without contriving to &s;ee them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="189">
<Q REND="inline">"There is not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould trouble you to quit the room: I merely came to beg you would have the goodne&s;s to be pre&s;ent while Mr. Arnott opens a &s;mall packet which was la&s;t night put into my hands by Mr. Harrel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And has Mr. Arnott,"</Q> an&s;wered he, &s;omewhat &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline">"thought proper to &s;end me &s;uch a reque&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the reque&s;t is mine; and if, as I now fear, it is imperti|nent, I mu&s;t entreat you to forget it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As ar as relates merely to your&s;elf,"</Q> returned Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"it is another mat|ter; but certainly Mr. Arnott, can have no po&s;&s;ible claim upon my time or attention; and I think it rather extraordinary, that a young man with whom I have no &s;ort of connection or commerce, and who&s;e very name is almo&s;t unknown to me, &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on in my &s;tile of life &s;o little occupied as to be wholly at his command."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He had no &s;uch idea, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia greatly di&s;concerted; <Q REND="inline">"the honour of your pre&s;ence is merely &s;olicited by my&s;elf, and &s;imply from the apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome directions may be contained in the papers which, perhaps, ought immediately to be executed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not, I repeat,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile,
<PB N="191" REF="190">
more mildly, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;plea&s;ed at your part of this tran&s;action; your want of experience and knowledge of the world makes you not at all aware of the con&s;equences which may follow my compliance: the papers you &s;peak of may perhaps be of great impor|tance, and hereafter the fir&s;t witne&s;&s;es to their being read may be publickly called upon. You know not the trouble &s;uch an affair may occa&s;ion, but Mr. Arnott ought to be better informed."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, making another apology for the error which &s;he had committed, was in no &s;mall confu&s;ion, quitting the room; but Mr. Delvile, perfectly appea&s;ed by &s;eeing her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;topt her, to &s;ay, with much graciou&s;ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"For your &s;ake, Mi&s;s Bever|ley, I am &s;orry I cannot act in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but you &s;ee how I am &s;ituated! over|powered with affairs of my own, and people who can do nothing without my orders. Be&s;ides, &s;hould there hereafter be any inve&s;|tigation into the matter, my name might, perhaps, be mentioned, and it would be &s;uperfluous to &s;ay how ill I &s;hould think it u&s;ed by being brought into &s;uch com|pany."</Q></P>
<P>"Cecilia then left the room, &s;ecretly vowing that no po&s;&s;ible exigence &s;hould in future tempt her to apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mr. Delvile, which, however o&s;tentatiou&s;ly
<PB N="192" REF="191">
offered, was con&s;tantly with-held when claimed.</P>
<P>She was beginning to communicate to Mr. Arnott her ill &s;ucce&s;s, when young Delvile, with an air of eagerne&s;s, followed her into the room. <Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> he cri|ed, <Q REND="inline">"for this intru&s;ion,&mdash;but, tell me, is it impo&s;&s;ible that in this affair I can repre&s;ent my father? may not the office you meant for him, devolve upon me? remember how near we are to each other, and honour me for once with &s;uppo&s;ing us the &s;ame!"</Q></P>
<P>Ah who, or what, thought Cecilia, can be &s;o different? She thanked him, with much &s;weetne&s;s, for his offer, but declined ac|cepting it, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"I will not, now I know the inconveniencies of my reque&s;t, be &s;o &s;el|fi&s;h as even to &s;uffer it &s;hould be granted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t not deny me,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"where is the packet? why &s;hould you lo&s;e a moment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rather a&s;k,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why I &s;hould permit <HI>you</HI> to lo&s;e a moment in a matter that does not concern you? and to ri&s;k, perhaps, the lo&s;s of many moments hereafter, from a too incautious politene&s;s."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And what can I ri&s;k,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"half &s;o precious as your &s;malle&s;t &s;atisfaction? do you &s;uppo&s;e I can flatter my&s;elf with a po&s;|&s;ibility of contributing to it, and yet have the re&s;olution to refu&s;e my&s;elf &s;o much plea|&s;ure?
<PB N="193" REF="192">
no, no, the heroic times are over, and &s;elf-denial is no longer in fa&s;hion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but indeed after what has pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter for what has pa&s;&s;ed,"</Q> inter|rupted he, <Q REND="inline">"we are now to think of what is to come. I know you too well to doubt your impatience in the execution of a com|mi&s;&s;ion which circum&s;tances have rendered &s;acred; and &s;hould any thing either be done or omitted contrary to the directions in your packet, will you not be apt, blamele&s;s as you are, to di&s;turb your&s;elf with a thou&s;and fears that you took not proper methods for the di&s;charge of your tru&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething in this earne&s;tne&s;s &s;o like his former behaviour, and &s;o far re|moved from his late re&s;erve, that Cecilia, who perceived it with a plea&s;ure &s;he could hardly di&s;gui&s;e, now oppo&s;ed him no longer, but took up the packet, and broke the &s;eal.</P>
<P>And then, to her no &s;mall amazement, in&s;tead of the expected will, &s;he found a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ll of enormous bills, and a collection of letters from various creditors, threatening the3 utmo&s;t &s;everity of the law if their de|mands were longer unan&s;wered.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;lip of paper which held the&s;e to|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ther was written, in Mr. Harrel's hand.<Q><HI>To be all paid to-night with a</HI> BULLET.</Q></P>
<P>Next appeared two letters of another

<P>What a &s;cene of fraud, double-dealing, and iniquity was here laid open! Cecilia, who at fir&s;t meant to read every thing aloud,
<PB N="195" REF="194">
found the attempt utterly vain, for &s;o much was &s;he &s;hocked, that &s;he could hard|ly read on to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all appeared a paper in Mr. Har|rel's own hand-writing, containing the&s;e words.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>For Mrs. HARREL, Mi&s;s BEVERLEY, and Mr. ARNOTT.</HEAD>
<P>I can &s;truggle no longer, the la&s;t blow mu&s;t now be &s;truck! another day robs me of my hou&s;e and my liberty, and bla&s;ts me by the fatal di&s;covery of my double at|tempts.</P>
<P>This is what I have wi&s;hed; wholly to be freed, or ruined pa&s;t all re&s;ource, and driven to the long-projected remedy.</P>
<P>A burthen has my exi&s;tence been the&s;e two years, gay as I have appeared; not a night have I gone to bed, but heated and inflamed from a gaming table; not a morn|ing have I awaked, but to be &s;oured with a dun!</P>
<P>I would not lead &s;uch a life again, if the &s;lave who works harde&s;t at the oar would change with me.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Wretch as Mr. Harrel appeared, without religion, principle, or honour, this inco|herent letter, evidently written in the de&s;|perate moment of determined &s;uicide, very much affected both Cecilia and Mr. Arnott,
<PB N="197" REF="196">
and in &s;pite either of abhorrence or re&s;ent|ment, they mutually &s;hed tears over the ad|dre&s;s to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Delvile, to whom every part of the affair was new, could only con&s;ider the&s;e papers as &s;o many &s;pecimens of guilt and infamy; he read them, therefore, with a&s;toni&s;hment and dete&s;tation, and openly congratulated Ceci|lia upon having e&s;caped the double &s;nares that were &s;pread for her.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing, Mr. Monckton arrived; who felt but little &s;atisfaction from beholding the lady of his heart in con|fidential di&s;cour&s;e with two of his rivals, one of whom had long attacked her by the dan|gerous flattery of per&s;everance, and the other, without any attack, had an influ|ence yet more powerful.</P>
<P>Delvile, having performed the office for which he came, concluded, upon the en|trance of Mr. Monckton, that Cecilia had nothing further to wi&s;h from him; for her long acquaintance with that gentleman, his being a <HI>married man,</HI> and her neighbour in the country, were circum&s;tances well known to him: he merely, therefore, enquired if &s;he would honour him with any commands, and upon her a&s;&s;uring him &s;he had none, he quietly withdrew.</P>
<P>This was no little relief to Mr. Monck|ton, into who&s;e hands Cecilia then put the
<PB N="198" REF="197">
fatal packet: and while he was reading it, at the de&s;ire of Mr. Arnott, &s;he went up &s;tairs to prepare Mrs. Harrel for his ad|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, unu&s;ed to &s;olitude, and as eager for company when unhappy to con|&s;ole, as when ea&s;y to divert her, con&s;ented to receive him with plea&s;ure: they both wept at the meeting, and Cecilia, after &s;ome words of general comfort, left them toge|ther.</P>
<P>She had then a very long and circum|&s;tantial conver&s;ation with Mr. Monckton, who explained whatever had appeared dark in the writings left by Mr. Harrel, and who came to her before he &s;aw them, with full knowledge of what they contained.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel had contracted with Sir Ro|bert Floyer a large debt of honour before the arrival in town of Cecilia; and having no power to di&s;charge it, he promi&s;ed that the prize he expected in his ward &s;hould fall to his &s;hare, upon condition that the debt was cancelled.</P>
<P>Nothing was thought more ea&s;y than to arrange this bu&s;ine&s;s, for the Baronet was always to be in her way, and the report of the intended alliance was to keep off all other pretenders. Several times, however, her coldne&s;s made him think the matter hopele&s;s; and when he received her letter,
<PB N="199" REF="198">
he would have given up the whole affair: but Mr. Harrel, well knowing his inability to &s;atisfy the claims that would follow &s;uch a defection, con&s;tantly per&s;uaded him the re&s;erve was affected, and that his own pride and want of a&s;&s;iduity occa&s;ioned all her di&s;|couragement.</P>
<P>But while thus, by amu&s;ing the Baronet with fal&s;e hopes, he kept off his demands, tho&s;e of others were not le&s;s clamorous: his debts encrea&s;ed, his power of paying them dimini&s;hed; he grew &s;our and de&s;pe|rate, and in one night lo&s;t 3000<HI>l.</HI> beyond what he could produce, or offer any &s;ecu|rity for.</P>
<P>This, as he &s;aid, was <HI>what he wi&s;hed;</HI> and now he was, for the pre&s;ent, to extricate him&s;elf by doubling &s;takes and winning, or to force him&s;elf into &s;uicide by doubling &s;uch a lo&s;s. For though, with tolerable ea&s;e, he could forget accounts innumerable with his trade&s;men, one neglected <HI>debt of ho|nour</HI> rendered his exi&s;tence in&s;upportable!</P>
<P>For this la&s;t great effort, his difficulty was to rai&s;e the 3000<HI>l.</HI> already due, without which the propo&s;al could not be made: and, after various artifices and attempts, he at length contrived a meeting with Mr. Marriot, intreated him to lend him 2000<HI>l.</HI> for only two days, and offered his warme&s;t &s;ervices in his favour with Cecilia.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="199">
The ra&s;h and impa&s;&s;ioned young man, deceived by his accounts into believing that his ward was wholly at his di&s;po&s;al, readily advanced the money, without any other condition than that of leave to vi&s;it freely at his hou&s;e, to the exclu&s;ion of Sir Robert Floyer. <Q REND="inline">"The other 1000<HI>l.</HI>"</Q> con|tinued Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"I know not how he obtained, but he certainly had three.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mr. Monckton,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"blame me not too &s;everely! the attacks that were made,&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of otherwi&s;e betraying the worthy and half ruined Mr. Arnott&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;uffer <HI>your</HI> un|der&s;tanding to be lulled a&s;leep, becau&s;e the weak-minded Mr. Arnott's could not be kept awake! I thought, after &s;uch cautions from me, and &s;uch experience of your own, you could not again have been thus duped."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought &s;o too,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but yet when the trial came on,&mdash;indeed you know not how I was per&s;ecuted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet you &s;ee,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"the utter inutility of the attempt; you &s;ee, and I told you beforehand, that nothing could &s;ave him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True; but had I been firmer in refu|&s;al, I might not &s;o well have known it; I might then have upbraided my&s;elf with
<PB N="201" REF="200">
&s;uppo&s;ing that my compliance would have re&s;cued him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have indeed,"</Q> cried Mr. Monk|ton, <Q REND="inline">"fallen into mo&s;t worthle&s;s hands, and the Dean was much to blame for nam|ing &s;o lightly a guardian to a fortune &s;uch as yours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he never entru&s;ted him with my fortune, he commit|ted it wholly to Mr. Briggs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But if he knew not the various &s;ubter|fuges by which &s;uch a caution might be baffled, he ought to have taken advice of tho&s;e who were better informed. Mr. Briggs, too! what a wretch! mean, low, vulgar, &s;ordid!&mdash;the whole city of Lon|don, I believe, could not produce &s;uch another! how unaccountable to make you the ward of a man who&s;e hou&s;e you cannot enter without di&s;gu&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His hou&s;e,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"my uncle never wi&s;hed me to enter; he believed, and he was right, that my fortune would be &s;afe in his hands; but for my&s;elf, he concluded I &s;hould always re&s;ide at Mr. Harrel's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But does not the city at this time,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"abound in families where, while your fortune was in &s;ecurity, you might your&s;elf have lived with proprie|ty? Nothing requires circum&s;pection &s;o minute as the choice of a guardian to a girl
<PB N="202" REF="201">
of large fortune, and in general one thing only is attended to, an appearance of pro|perty. Morals, integrity, character, are either not thought of, or inve&s;tigated &s;o &s;uperficially, that the enquiry were as well wholly omitted."</Q></P>
<P>He then continued his relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel ha&s;tened with his 3000<HI>l.</HI> to the gaming table; one throw of the dice &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s, he lo&s;t, and ought im|mediately to have doubled the &s;um. That, however, was never more likely to be in his power; he knew it; he knew, too, the joint claims of Cecilia's deceived admirers, and that his hou&s;e was again threatened with executions from various quarters:&mdash;he went home, loaded his pi&s;tols, and took the methods already related to work him&s;elf into courage for the deed.</P>
<P>The means by which Mr. Monckton had procured the&s;e particulars were many and various, and not all &s;uch as he could avow: &s;ince in the cour&s;e of his re&s;earches, he had tampered with &s;ervants and waiters, and &s;crupled at no methods that led but to di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>Nor did his intelligence &s;top here; he had often, he &s;aid, wondered at the patience of Mr. Harrel's creditors, but now even that was cleared up by a fre&s;h proof of in|famy: he had been him&s;elf at the hou&s;e in
<PB N="203" REF="202">
Portman-&s;quare, where he was informed that Mr. Harrel had kept them quiet, by repeated a&s;&s;urances that his ward, in a &s;hort time, meant to lend him money for di&s;|charging them all.</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;aw now but too clearly the rea|&s;on her &s;tay in his hou&s;e was &s;o important to him; and wondered le&s;s at his vehemence upon that &s;ubject, though &s;he dete&s;ted it more.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh how little,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"are the gay and the di&s;&s;ipated to be known upon a &s;hort acquaintance! expen&s;ive, indeed, and thoughtle&s;s and luxurious he appeared to me immediately; but fraudulent, ba&s;e, de|&s;igning, capable of every pernicious art of treachery and duplicity,&mdash;&s;uch, indeed, I expected not to find him, his very flightine&s;s and levity &s;eemed incompatible with &s;uch hypocri&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His flightine&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"proceeded not from gaiety of heart, it was merely the effect of effort; and his &s;pirits were as mechanical as his ta&s;te for diver|&s;ion. He had not &s;trong parts, nor were his vices the re&s;ult of his pa&s;&s;ions; had oeconomy been as much in fa&s;hion as extra|vagance, he would have been equally eager to practice it; he was a mere time-&s;erver, he &s;truggled but to be <HI>&s;omething,</HI> and having neither talents nor &s;entiment to know <HI>what,</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="203">
he looked around him for any pur&s;uit, and &s;eeing di&s;tinction was more ea&s;ily attained in the road to ruin than in any other, he gal|lopped along it, thoughtle&s;s of being thrown when he came to the bottom, and &s;ufficient|ly gratified in &s;hewing his hor&s;eman&s;hip by the way."</Q></P>
<P>And now, all that he had either to hear or to communicate upon this &s;ubject being told, he enquired, with a face &s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his di&s;approbation, why he found her at Mr. Delvile's, and what had become of her re&s;olution to avoid his hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Cecilia, who, in the hurry of her mind and her affairs, had wholly forgotten that &s;uch a re&s;olution had been taken, blu&s;hed at the que&s;tion, and could not, at fir&s;t, recol|lect what had urged her to break it: but when he proceeded to mention Mr. Briggs, &s;he was no longer di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; &s;he gave a cir|cum&s;tantial account of her vi&s;it to him, re|lated the mean mi&s;ery in which he lived, and told him the impracticability of her re|&s;iding in &s;uch a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton could now in decency make no further oppo&s;ition, however painful and reluctant was his acquie&s;cence: yet be|fore he quitted her, he gave him&s;elf the con&s;olation of con&s;iderably obliging her, and &s;oftened his chagrin by the &s;weetne&s;s of her acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="204">
He enquired how much money in all &s;he had now taken up of the Jew; and hearing it was 9050<HI>l.</HI> he repre&s;ented to her the ad|ditional lo&s;s &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer by paying an exorbitant intere&s;t for &s;o large a &s;um, and the almo&s;t certainty with which &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured of very gro&s;s impo&s;ition: he ex|patiated, al&s;o, upon the injury which her character might receive in the world, were it known that &s;he u&s;ed &s;uch methods to procure money, &s;ince the circum&s;tances which had been her inducement would probably either be unnoticed or mi&s;repre|&s;ented: and when he had awakened in her much unea&s;ine&s;s and regret upon this &s;ub|ject, he offered to pay the Jew without de|lay, clear her wholly from his power, and quietly receive the money when &s;he came of age from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al &s;o truly friendly made her look upon the regard of Mr. Monckton in a higher and nobler point of view than her utmo&s;t e&s;teem and reverence had hitherto placed it: yet &s;he declined at fir&s;t accept|ing the offer, from an apprehen&s;ion it might occa&s;ion him inconvenience; but when he a&s;&s;ured her he had a yet larger &s;um lying at pre&s;ent u&s;ele&s;s in a Banker's hands, and pro|mi&s;ed to receive the &s;ame intere&s;t for his money he &s;hould be paid from the funds, &s;he joyfully li&s;tened to him; and it was
<PB N="206" REF="205">
&s;ettled that they &s;hould &s;end for the Jew, take his di&s;charge, and utterly di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, however, fearful of ap|pearing too officious in her affairs, wi&s;hed not to have his part in the tran&s;action pub|li&s;hed, and advi&s;ed Cecilia not to reveal the matter to the Delviles. But great as was his a&s;cendant over her mind, her aver|&s;ion to my&s;tery and hypocri&s;y were &s;till greater; &s;he would not, therefore, give him this promi&s;e, though her own de&s;ire to wait &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable opportunity for di&s;clo&s;ing it, made her con&s;ent that their meeting with the Jew &s;hould be at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Roberts in Fetter-lane, at twelve o'clock the next morning; where &s;he might al&s;o &s;ee Mrs. Hill and her children before &s;he left town.</P>
<P>They now parted, Cecilia charmed more than ever with her friend, who&s;e kindne&s;s, as &s;he &s;u&s;pected not his motives, &s;eemed to &s;pring from the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>That, however, was the &s;malle&s;t feature in the character of Mr. Monckton, who was entirely a man of the world, &s;hrewd, penetrating, attentive to his intere&s;t, and watchful of every advantage to improve it. In the &s;ervice he now did Cecilia, he was gratified by giving her plea&s;ure, but that was by no means his only gratification:
<PB N="207" REF="206">
he &s;till hoped her fortune would one day be his own, he was glad to tran&s;act any bu&s;i|ne&s;s with her, and happy in making her owe to him an obligation: but his princi|pal inducement was yet &s;tronger: he &s;aw with much alarm the facility of her liberali|ty; and he feared while &s;he continued in corre&s;pondence with the Jew, that the ea&s;i|ne&s;s with which &s;he could rai&s;e money would be a motive with her to continue the practice whenever &s;he was &s;oftened by di&s;|tre&s;s, or &s;ubdued by entreaty: but he hoped, by totally concluding the negociation, the temptation would be removed: and that the hazard and inconvenience of renewing it, would &s;trengthen her aver&s;ion to &s;uch an expedient, till, between difficulties and di&s;u&s;e, that dangerous re&s;ource would be thought of no more.</P>
<P>Cecilia then returned to Mrs. Harrel, whom &s;he found as &s;he had left, weeping in the arms of her brother. They con&s;ult|ed upon what was be&s;t to be done, and agreed that &s;he ought in&s;tantly to leave town; for which purpo&s;e a chai&s;e was ordered directly. They &s;ettled al&s;o that Mr. Arnott, when he had conveyed her to his country hou&s;e, which was in Suffolk, &s;hould ha&s;ten back to &s;uperintend the fu|neral, and &s;ee if any thing could be &s;aved from the creditors for his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="207">
Yet this plan, till Cecilia was &s;ummoned to dinner, they had not the re&s;olution to put in practice. They were then obliged to be gone, and their parting was very melancholy. Mrs. Harrel wept immode|rately, and Mr. Arnott felt a concern too tender for avowal, though too &s;incere for concealment. Cecilia, however glad to change her &s;ituation, was extremely depre&s;|&s;ed by their &s;orrow, and entreated to have frequent accounts of their proceedings, warmly repeating her offers of &s;ervice, and prote&s;tations of faithful regard.</P>
<P>She accompanied them to the chai&s;e, and then went to the dining parlour, where &s;he found Mr. and Mrs. Delvile, but &s;aw nothing more of their &s;on the whole day.</P>
<P>The next morning after breakfa&s;t, Mrs. Delvile &s;et out upon &s;ome leave-taking vi&s;its, and Cecilia went in a chair to Fetter|lane: here, already waiting for her, &s;he met the punctual Mr. Monckton, and the di&s;appointed Jew, who mo&s;t unwillingly was paid off, and relinqui&s;hed his bonds; and who found in the &s;evere and crafty Mr. Monckton, another &s;ort of man to deal with than the nece&s;&s;itous and heedle&s;s Mr. Harrel.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, other bonds were drawn and &s;igned, the old ones were de&s;troyed; and Cecilia, to her infinite &s;atis|faction,
<PB N="209" REF="208">
had no creditor but Mr. Monckton. Her book&s;eller, indeed, was &s;till unpaid, but her debt with him was public, and gave her not any unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>She now, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, took leave of Mr. Monckton, who &s;uffered the mo&s;t painful &s;truggles in repre&s;&s;ing the various apprehen&s;ions to which the parting, and her e&s;tabli&s;hment at the Delviles gave ri&s;e.</P>
<P>She then enquired briefly into the affairs of Mrs. Hill, and having heard a &s;atisfac|tory account of them, returned to St. James's-&s;quare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. A DEBATE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;till early, and Mrs. Delvile was not expected till late. Cecilia, therefore, determined to make a vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Belfield, to whom &s;he had been denied during the late di&s;orders at Mr. Harrel's, and whom &s;he could not endure to mortify by quitting town without &s;eeing, &s;ince whatever were her doubts about Delvile, of her &s;he had none.</P>
<P>To Portland-&s;treet, therefore, &s;he ordered her chair, deliberating as &s;he went whether it were better to adhere to the re&s;erve &s;he had hitherto maintained, or to &s;atisfy her perplexity at once by an inve&s;tigation into the truth. And &s;till were the&s;e &s;cruples undecided, when, looking in at the win|dows as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed them to the door of the hou&s;e, &s;he perceived Mi&s;s Belfield &s;tanding in the parlour with a letter in her hand which &s;he was fervently pre&s;&s;ing to her lips.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="210">
Struck by this &s;ight, a thou&s;and painful conjectures occurred to her, all repre&s;enting that the letter was from Delvile, and all explaining to his di&s;honour the my&s;tery of his late conduct. And far were her &s;u&s;picions from dimini&s;hing, when, upo nbeing &s;hewn into the parlour, Mi&s;s Belfield, trembling with her eagerne&s;s to hide it, ha&s;tily forced the letter into her pocket.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed, di&s;mayed, alarmed, &s;topt involuntary at the door; but Mi&s;s Belfield, having &s;ecured what was &s;o evi|dently precious to her, advanced, though not without blu&s;hing, and taking her hand, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"How good this is of you, madam, to come to me! when I did not know where to find you, and when I was almo&s;t afraid I &s;hould have found you no more!"</Q></P>
<P>She then told her, that the fir&s;t news &s;he had heard the preceding morning, was the violent death of Mr. Harrel, which had been related to her, with all its circum&s;tan|ces, by the landlord of their lodgings, who was him&s;elf one of his principal credi|tors, and had immediately been at Portman|&s;quare to put in his claims; where he had learnt that all the family had quitted the hou&s;e, which was entirely occupied by bailiffs. <Q REND="inline">"And I was &s;o &s;orry,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould meet with any hard&s;hips, and not know where to go, and have ano|ther home to &s;eek, when I am &s;ure the

commone&s;t beggar would never want an ha|bitation, if you had one in your power to give him!&mdash;But how &s;ad and melancholy you look! I am afraid this bad action of Mr. Harrel has made you quite unhappy? Ah madam! you are too good for this guilty world! your own compa&s;&s;ion and benevolence will not &s;uffer you to re&s;t in it!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, touched by this tender mi&s;take of her pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s, embraced her, and with much kindne&s;s, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, &s;weet Henrietta! it is <HI>you</HI> who are good, who are innocent, who are guilele&s;s!&mdash;<HI>you,</HI> too, I hope are happy!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are not you, madam?"</Q> cried Henrietta, fondly returning her care&s;&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"Oh if you are not, who will ever de&s;erve to be! I think I &s;hould rather be unhappy my&s;elf, than &s;ee you &s;o; at lea&s;t I am &s;ure I ought, for the whole world may be the better for your welfare, and as to me,&mdash;who would care what became of me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah Henrietta!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"do you &s;peak &s;incerely? do you indeed think your&s;elf &s;o little valued?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I don't &s;ay,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but that I hope there are &s;ome who think a litle kindly of me, for if I had not that hope, I &s;hould wi&s;h to break my heart and die! but what is that to the love and reve|rence &s;o many have for you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with a forced
<PB N="213" REF="212">
&s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould put <HI>your</HI> love and reve|rence to the proof? do you think they would &s;tand it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, indeed I do! and I have wi&s;hed a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times that I could but &s;hew you my affection, and let you &s;ee that I did not love you becau&s;e you were a great lady, and high in the world, and full of power to do me &s;ervice, but becau&s;e you were &s;o good and &s;o kind, &s;o gentle to the unfortunate, and &s;o &s;weet to every body!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold, hold,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and let me try if indeed, fairly and truly, you will an&s;wer what I mean to a&s;k."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes,"</Q> cried &s;he warmly, <Q REND="inline">"if it is the deare&s;t &s;ecret I have in the world! there is nothing I will not tell you; I will open my whole heart to you, and I &s;hall be proud to think you will let me tru&s;t you,&mdash;for I am &s;ure if you did not care a little for me, you would not take &s;uch a trouble."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are indeed a &s;weet creature!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, he&s;itating whether or not to take advantage of her frankne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and every time I &s;ee you, I love you better. For the world would I not injure you,&mdash;and per|haps your confidence&mdash;I know not, indeed, if it is fair or right to exact it&mdash;"</Q> &s;he &s;topt, extremely perplext, and while Henrietta waited her further enquiries, they were
<PB N="214" REF="213">
interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Bel|field.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sure, Child,"</Q> cried &s;he, to her daugh|ter, <Q REND="inline">"you might have let me know before now who was here, when you knew &s;o well how much I wi&s;hed an opportunity to &s;ee the young lady my&s;elf: but here you come down upon pretence to &s;ee your brother, and then &s;tay away all the morning, doing nobody knows what."</Q></P>
<P>Then, turning to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Ma'am,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I have been in the great|e&s;t concern in the world for the little accident that happened when I &s;aw you before; for to be &s;ure I thought, and indeed nobody will per&s;uade me to the contrary, that it was rather an odd thing for &s;uch a young lady as you to come &s;o often after Henny, without &s;o much as thinking of any other rea&s;on; e&s;pecially when, to be &s;ure, there's no more compari&s;on between her and my &s;on, than between any thing in the world; however, if it is &s;o, it is &s;o, and I mean to &s;ay no more about it, and to be &s;ure he's as contented to think &s;o as if he was as mere an in&s;ignificant animal as could be."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This matter, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"has &s;o long been &s;ettled, that I am &s;orry you &s;hould trouble your&s;elf to think of it again."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="214">
<Q REND="inline">"O, ma'am, I only mention it by the way of making the proper apology, for as to taking any other notice of it, I have quite left it off; though to be &s;ure what I think I think; but as to my &s;on, he has &s;o got the upper hand of me, that it all goes for nothing, and I might ju&s;t as well &s;ing to him. Not that I mean to find fault with him neither; &s;o pray, ma'am, don't let what I &s;ay be to his prejudice, for I believe all the time, there's nobody like him, neither at this end of the town nor the other; for as to the other, he has more the look of a lord, by half, than of a &s;hop|man, and the rea&s;on's plain, for that's the &s;ort of company he's always kept, as I dare &s;ay a lady &s;uch as you mu&s;t have &s;een long ago. But for all that, there's &s;ome little matters that we mothers fancy we can &s;ee into as well as our children; however, if they don't think &s;o, why it an&s;wers no purpo&s;e to di&s;pute; for as to a better &s;on, to be &s;ure there never was one, and that, as I always &s;ay, is the be&s;t &s;ign I know for making a good hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P>During this di&s;cour&s;e, Henrietta was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, dreading le&s;t the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of her mother &s;hould again &s;end off Cecilia in anger: but Cecilia, who per|ceived her unea&s;ine&s;s, and who was more charmed with her character than ever, from
<PB N="216" REF="215">
the &s;implicity of her &s;incerity, determined to &s;ave her that pain, by quietly hearing her ha|rangue, and then quietly departing: though &s;he was much provoked to find from the complaining hints every in&s;tant thrown out, that Mrs. Belfield was &s;till internally con|vinced her &s;on's ob&s;tinate ba&s;hfulne&s;s was the only ob&s;tacle to his chu&s;ing whom he plea&s;ed: and that though &s;he no longer dared &s;peak her opinion with openne&s;s, &s;he was fully per&s;uaded Cecilia was at his &s;ervice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And for that rea&s;on,"</Q> continued Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"to be &s;ure any lady that knew her own true advantage, could do nothing better than to take the recommendation of a mo|ther, who mu&s;t naturally know more of her own children's di&s;po&s;ition than can be expected from a &s;tranger: and as to &s;uch a &s;on as mine, perhaps there a'n't two &s;uch in the world, for he's had a gentleman's education, and turn him which way he will, he'll &s;ee never a hand&s;omer per&s;on than his own; though, poor dear love, he was al|ways of the thinne&s;t. But the misfortunes he's had to &s;truggle with would make no|body fatter."</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted, and Cecilia not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, by the entrance of Mr. Hob&s;on and Mr. Simkins.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ladies,"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on, whom &s;he

&s;oon found was Mrs. Belfield's landlord: <Q REND="inline">"I would not go up &s;tairs without ju&s;t &s;topping to let you know a little how the world goes."</Q></P>
<P>Then perceiving and recollecting Cecilia, he exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"I am proud to &s;ee you again, ma'am,&mdash;Mi&s;s, I believe I &s;hould &s;ay, for I take it you are too young a lady to be entered into matrimony yet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Matrimony?"</Q> cried Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"no, to be &s;ure, Mr. Hob&s;on, how can you be &s;o out of the way? the young lady looks more like to a Mi&s;s from a boarding|&s;chool, if I might take the liberty for to &s;ay &s;o."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, more's the pity,"</Q> cried Mrs. Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"for as to young ladies waiting and waiting, I don't &s;ee the great good of it; e&s;pecially if a proper match offers; for as to a good hu&s;band, I think no lady &s;hould be above accepting him, if he's mode&s;t and well-behaved, and has been brought up with a genteel education."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why as to that, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Sim|kins, <Q REND="inline">"its anothergue&s;s matter, for as to the lady's having a proper &s;pou&s;e, if I may be &s;o free, I think as it's no bad thing."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, taking Henrietta's hand, was wi&s;hing her good morning; but hear|ing Mr. Hob&s;on &s;ay he was ju&s;t come from
<PB N="218" REF="217">
Portman-&s;quare, her curio&s;ity was excited, and &s;he &s;tayed a little longer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sad work, ma'am,</Q> "&s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"who'd have thought Mr. Harrel a&s;ked us all to &s;upper for the mere purpo&s;e of &s;uch a thing as that! ju&s;t to &s;erve for a blind, as one may &s;ay. But when a man's con&s;cience is foul, what I &s;ay is it's ten to one but he makes away with him&s;elf. Let every man keep clear of the world, that's my notion, and then he will be in no &s;uch hurry to get out of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Sim|kins, advancing with many bows to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"humbly craving pardon for the liberty, I can't pretend for to &s;ay I think Mr. Harrel did quite the honourable thing by us; for as to his making us drink all that Cham|pagne, and the like, it was a &s;heer take in, &s;o that if I was to &s;peak my mind, I can't &s;ay as I e&s;teem it much of a favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Belfield," <Q REND="inline">nothing's to me &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing as a per&s;on's being his own executioner, for as to me, if I was to die for it fifty times, I don't think I could do it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So here,</Q> re&s;umed Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"we're all defrauded of our dues! nobody's able to get his own, let him have worked for it ever &s;o hard. Sad doings in the &s;quare, Mi&s;s! all at &s;ixes and &s;evens; for my part
<PB N="219" REF="218">
I came off from Vauxhall as &s;oon as the thing had happened, hoping to get the &s;tart of the others, or el&s;e I &s;hould have been proud to wait upon you, ladies, with the particulars: but a man of bu&s;ine&s;s never &s;tands upon ceremony, for when money's at &s;take, that's out of the que&s;tion. How|ever, I was too late, for the hou&s;e was &s;eized before ever I could get nigh it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, ma'am, if I may be &s;o free,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Simkins, again profoundly bow|ing, <Q REND="inline">"that you and the other lady did not take it much ami&s;s my not coming back to you, for it was not out of no di&s;re&s;pect, but only I got &s;o &s;queezed in by the ladies and gentlemen that was a looking on, that I could not make my way out, do what I could. But by what I &s;ee, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay if one's never in &s;uch genteel company, people are always rather of the rude&s;t when one's in a crowd, for if one begs and prays never &s;o, there's no making 'em conform|able."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is it likely any thing will remain for Mrs. Harrel?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Remain, ma'am?"</Q> repeated Mr. Hob|&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"yes, a matter of a hundred bills without a receipt to 'em! To be &s;ure, ma'am, I don't want to affront you, that was his intimate acquaintance, more e&s;pe|cially as you've done nothing di&s;re&s;pectful
<PB N="220" REF="219">
by me, which is more than I can &s;ay for Mrs. Harrel, who &s;eemed downright a&s;ham|ed of me, and of Mr. Simkins too, though all things con&s;idered, 'twould have been as well for her not to have been quite &s;o high. But of that in its proper &s;ea&s;on!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fie, Mr. Hob&s;on fie,"</Q> cried the &s;upple Mr. Simkins, <Q REND="inline">"how can you be &s;o hard? for my &s;hare, I mu&s;t needs own I think the poor lady's to be pitied; for it mu&s;t have been but a molloncholy &s;ight to her, to &s;ee her &s;pou&s;e cut off &s;o in the flower of his youth, as one may &s;ay: and you ought to &s;corn to take exceptions at a lady's proud|ne&s;s when &s;he's in &s;o much trouble. To be &s;ure, I can't &s;ay my&s;elf as &s;he was over|complai&s;ant to make us welcome; but I hope I am above being &s;o unpitiful as for to owe her a grudge for it now &s;he's &s;o down in the mouth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let every body be civil!"</Q> cried Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"that's my notion; and then I &s;hall be as much above being unpitiful as any body el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mrs Harrel,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"was then too unhappy, and is now, &s;urely, too un|fortunate, to make it po&s;&s;ible any re&s;ent|ment &s;hould be harboured again&s;t her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak, ma'am, like a lady of &s;en&s;e,"</Q> returned Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"and, indeed, that's the character I hear of you; but for
<PB N="221" REF="220">
all that, ma'am, every body's willing to &s;tand up for their own friends, for which rea|&s;on, ma'am, to be &s;ure you'll be making the be&s;t of it, both for the Relict, and the late gentleman him&s;elf; but, ma'am, if I was to make bold to &s;peak my mind in a fair manner, what I &s;hould &s;ay would be this: a man here to go &s;hooting him&s;elf with all his debts unpaid, is a mere piece of &s;can|dal, ma'am! I beg pardon, but what I &s;ay is, the truth's the truth, and I can't call it by no other nomination.</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, finding &s;he had not any chance of pacifying him, rang for her &s;er|vant and chair.</P>
<P>Mr. Simkins then, affecting to lower his voice, &s;aid reproachfully to his friend <Q REND="inline">"In|deed, Mr. Hob&s;on, to &s;peak ingenu&s;ly, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I don't think it over and above pelite in you to be &s;o hard upon the young lady's acquaintance that was, now he's defunct. To be &s;ure I can't pretend for to deny but he behaved rather comical; for not paying of nobody, nor &s;o much as making one a little compliment, or the like, though he made no bones of taking all one's goods, and always chu&s;ed to have the prime of every thing, why it's what I can't pretend to &s;tand up for. But that's neither here nor there, for if he had behav|ed as bad again, poor Mi&s;s could not tell
<PB N="222" REF="221">
how to help it; and I dares to &s;ay &s;he had no more hand in it than nobody at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, to be &s;ure,"</Q> cried Mrs. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hould &s;he have to do with it? do you &s;uppo&s;e a young lady of her fortune would want to take advantage of a per&s;on in trade? I am &s;ure it would be both a &s;hame and a &s;in if &s;he did, for if &s;he has not mo|ney enough, I wonder who has. And for my part, I think when a young lady has &s;uch a fine fortune as that, the only thing &s;he has to do, is to be thinking of making a good u&s;e of it, by dividing it, as one may &s;ay, with a good hu&s;band. For as to keep|ing it all for her&s;elf, I dare &s;ay &s;he's a lady of too much genero&s;ity; and as to only mar|rying &s;omebody that's got as much of his own, why it is not half &s;o much a fa|vour: and if the young lady would take my advice, &s;he'd marry for love, for as to lucre, &s;he's enough in all con&s;cience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to all that,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"it makes no alteration in my argument; I am &s;peaking to the purpo&s;e, and not for the matter of complai&s;ance: and therefore I'm bold to &s;ay Mr. Harrel's action had nothing of the gentleman in it. A man has a right to his own life, you'll tell me; but what of that? that's no argument at all, for it does not give him a bit the more right to my property; and a man's running in debt, and
<PB N="223" REF="222">
&s;pending other people's &s;ub&s;tances, for no rea&s;on in the world but ju&s;t becau&s;e he can blow out his own brains when he's done,&mdash;though its a thing neither lawful nor reli|gious to do,&mdash;why it's acting quite out of character, and a great hard&s;hip to trade into the bargain."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I heartily wi&s;h it had been otherwi&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but I &s;till hope, if any thing can be done for Mrs. Harrel, you will not object to &s;uch a propo&s;al."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am, as I &s;aid before,"</Q> returned Mr. Hob&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you're a lady of &s;en&s;e, and for that I honour you: but as to any thing being done, it's what I call a di&s;tinct thing. What's mine is mine, and what's another man's is his; that's my way of ar|guing; but then if he takes what's mine, where's the law to hinder my taking what's his? This is what I call talking to the pur|po&s;e. Now as to a man's cutting his throat, or the like of that, for blowing out his own brains may be called the &s;elf-&s;ame thing, what are his creditors the better for that? nothing at all, but &s;o much the wor&s;e: it's a fal&s;e notion to re&s;pect it, for there's no re&s;pect in it; it's contrary to law, and a prejudice again&s;t religion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I agree entirely in your opinion,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but &s;till Mrs. Harrel&mdash;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="224" REF="223">
know your argument, ma'am,"</Q> interrupted Mr. Hob&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Harrel i'n't the wor&s;e for her hu&s;band's being &s;hot through the head, becau&s;e &s;he was no acce&s;&s;ory to the &s;ame, and for that rea&s;on, it's a hard&s;hip &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e all her &s;ub&s;tance; this, ma'am, is what I &s;ay, &s;peaking to your &s;ide of the argument. But now, ma'am, plea&s;e to take notice what I argue upon the re|ply; what have we creditors to do with a man's family? Suppo&s;e I am a cabinet|maker? When I &s;end in my chairs, do I a&s;k who is to &s;it upon them? No; it's all one to me whether it's the gentleman's pro|geny or his friends, I mu&s;t be paid for the chairs the &s;ame, u&s;e them who may. That's the law, ma'am, and no man need be a&s;ham|ed to abide by it."</Q></P>
<P>The truth of this &s;peech palliating it's &s;ententious ab&s;urdity, made Cecilia give up her faint attempt to &s;often him; and her chair being ready, &s;he aro&s;e to take leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lack-a-day, ma'am,"</Q> cried Mrs. Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you won't go yet, for I ex|pect my &s;on home &s;oon, and I've a heap of things to talk to you about be&s;ides, only Mr. Hob&s;on having &s;o much to &s;ay &s;topt my mouth. But I &s;hould take it as a great favour, ma'am, if you would come &s;ome afternoon and drink a di&s;h of tea with me,
<PB N="225" REF="224">
for then we &s;hould have time to &s;ay all our &s;ay. And I'm &s;ure, ma'am, if you would only let one of your footmen ju&s;t take a run to let me know when you'd come, my &s;on would be very proud to give you the meeting; and the &s;ervants can't have much el&s;e to do at your hou&s;e, for where there's &s;uch a heap of 'em, they commonly think of nothing all day long but &s;tanding and gaping at one another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am going out of town to-morrow,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, coldly, <Q REND="inline">"and therefore cannot have the plea&s;ure of calling upon Mi&s;s Bel|field again."</Q></P>
<P>She then &s;lightly court&s;ied, and left the room.</P>
<P>The gentle Henrietta, her eyes &s;wimming in tears, followed her to her chair; but &s;he followed her not alone, Mrs. Belfield al&s;o attended, repining very loudly at the un|lucky ab&s;ence of her &s;on: and the cringing Mr. Simkins, creeping after her and bow|ing, &s;aid in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly crave pardon, ma'am, for the liberty, but I hope you won't think as I have any &s;hare in Mr. Hob&s;on's behaving &s;o rude, for I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I don't think it over genteel in no &s;hape."</Q> And Mr. Hob&s;on him&s;elf, bent upon having one more &s;entence heard, cal|led out, even after &s;he was &s;eated in her chair. <Q REND="inline">"All I &s;ay ma'am, is this; let every
<PB N="226" REF="225">
man be hone&s;t; that's what I argue, and that's my notion of things."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;till reached home before Mrs. Delvile; but mo&s;t unea&s;y were her &s;en&s;a|tions, and mo&s;t unquiet was her heart: the letter &s;he had &s;een in the hands of Henrietta &s;eemed to corroborate all her former &s;u&s;pi|cions, &s;ince if it came not from one infinite|ly dear to her &s;he would not have &s;hewn &s;uch fondne&s;s for it, and if that one was not dear to her in &s;ecret, &s;he would not have concealed it.</P>
<P>Where then was the hope that any but Delvile could have written it? <HI>in &s;ecret</HI> &s;he could not cheri&s;h <HI>two,</HI> and that Delvile was cheri&s;hed mo&s;t fondly, the artle&s;sne&s;s of her character unfitted her for di&s;gui&s;ing.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould he write to her? what was his pretence? That he loved her &s;he could now le&s;s than ever believe, &s;ince his late conduct to her&s;elf, though perplexing and incon&s;i&s;tent, evinced at lea&s;t a partiality incompatible with a pa&s;&s;ion for another. What then, could &s;he infer, but that he had &s;educed her affections, and ruined her peace, for the idle and cruel gratification of temporary vanity?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if &s;uch,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is the de|pravity of this accompli&s;hed hypocrite, if &s;uch is the littlene&s;s of &s;oul that a manner &s;o noble di&s;gui&s;es, &s;hall he next, urged,
<PB N="227" REF="226">
perhaps, rather by prudence than prefer|ence, make <HI>me</HI> the object of his pur&s;uit, and the food of his vain-glory? And &s;hall <HI>I,</HI> warned and in&s;tructed as I am, be as ea&s;y a prey, and as wretched a dupe? No, I will be better &s;atisfied with his conduct, before I venture to tru&s;t him, and &s;ince I am richer than Henrietta and le&s;s likely to be de&s;ert|ed, when won, I will be more on my guard to know why I am addre&s;&s;ed, and vindicate the rights of innocence, if I find &s;he has been thus deluded, by forgetting his talents in his treachery, and renouncing him for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Such were the reflections and &s;urmi&s;es that dampt all the long-&s;ought plea&s;ure of her change of re&s;idence, and made her habi|tation in St. James's Square no happier than it had been at Mr. Harrel's!</P>
<P>She dined again with only Mr. and Mrs. Delvile, and did not &s;ee their &s;on all day; which, in her pre&s;ent uncertainty what to think of him, was an ab&s;ence &s;he &s;carcely regretted.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants retired, Mr. Delvile told her that he had that morning received two vi&s;its upon her account, both from ad|mirers, who each pretended to having had leave to wait upon her from Mr. Harrel.</P>
<P>He then named Sir Robert Floyer and Mr. Marriot.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that
<PB N="228" REF="227">
neither of them were treated perfectly well; to me, however, their own behaviour has by no means been &s;trictly honourable. I have always, when referred to, been very ex|plicit; and what other methods they were plea&s;ed to take, I cannot wonder &s;hould fail."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I told them,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that, &s;ince you were now under my roof, I could not refu&s;e to receive their propo&s;als, e&s;pe|cially as there would be no impropriety in your alliance with either of them: but I told them, at the &s;ame time, that I could by no means think of pre&s;&s;ing their &s;uit, as that was an office which, however well it might do for Mr. Harrel, would be totally impro|per and unbecoming for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly;"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and per|mit me, Sir, to entreat that, &s;hould they again apply to you, they may be wholly di&s;couraged from repeating their vi&s;its, and a&s;&s;ured that far from having trifled with them hitherto, the re&s;olutions I have de|clared will never be varied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am happy,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee &s;o much &s;pirit and di&s;cernment where arts of all &s;orts will be practi&s;ed to en&s;nare and delude. Fortune and independance were never &s;o &s;ecurely lodged as in Mi&s;s Beverley, and I doubt not but her choice, whenever it is decided, will reflect as much honour upon her heart, as her difficulty in making it does upon her under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="228">
Mr. Delvile then enquired whether &s;he had fixed upon any per&s;on to chu&s;e as a guardian in the place of Mr. Harrel. No, &s;he &s;aid, nor &s;hould &s;he, unle&s;s it were ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"your affairs will not much mi&s;s him! Since I have heard of the exce&s;s of his ex|travagance, I have extremely rejoiced in the uncommon prudence and &s;agacity of his fair ward, who, in &s;uch dangerous hands, with le&s;s penetration and &s;ound &s;en&s;e, might have been drawn into a thou|&s;and difficulties, and perhaps defrauded of half her fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia received but little joy from this mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable compliment, which, with many of the &s;ame &s;ort that were frequently, though accidentally made, intimidated her from the confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had planned: and finding nothing but cen&s;ure was likely to follow the di&s;covery, &s;he at length deter|mined to give it up wholly, unle&s;s any con|nection &s;hould take place which might ren|der nece&s;&s;ary it's avowal. Yet &s;omething &s;he could not but murmur, that an action &s;o detrimental to her own intere&s;t, and which, at the time, appeared indi&s;pen&s;able to her benevolence, &s;hould now be con&s;idered as a mark of &s;uch folly and imprudence that &s;he did not dare own it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A RAILING.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning the family purpo&s;ed &s;etting off as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over: young Delvile, however, waited not &s;o long; the finene&s;s of the weather tempt|ed him, he &s;aid, to travel on hor&s;eback, and therefore he had ri&s;en very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not but won|der, yet did not repine.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as breakfa&s;t was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Delvile and Cecilia were preparing to depart, to their no little &s;urpri&s;e, the door was opened, and, out of breath with ha&s;te and with heat, in &s;tumpt Mr. Briggs! <Q REND="inline">"So,"</Q> cried he, to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"what's all this? hay?&mdash;where are going?&mdash;a coach at the door! hor&s;es to every wheel!

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, much di&s;concerted, <Q REND="inline">"if there has been any mi&s;take through my neglect; but I had hoped I was under&s;tood, and I have been &s;o much occupied&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"fine work! rare doings! a merry Vauxhalling, with pi&s;tols at all your noddles! thought as much! thought he'd tip the perch; &s;aw he was n't &s;tanch; knew he'd go by his com|pany,&mdash;a &s;et of jackanapes! all black|legs! nobody warm among 'em: fellows with a month's good living upon their backs, and not &s;ixpence for the hangman in their pockets!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile now, with a look of arch congratulation at Cecilia as the object of this agreeable vi&s;it, finding it not likely to be immediately concluded, returned to her chair: but Mr. Delvile, leaning &s;ternly upon his cane, moved not from the &s;pot where he &s;tood at his entrance, but &s;urveyed him from head to foot, with the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hed

<P>Cecilia, perceiving, with great confu&s;ion, that Mr. Delvile, though evidently provok|ed by this intru&s;ion, would not deign to &s;peak, that Mr. Briggs might be regarded as belonging wholly to her&s;elf, ha&s;tily &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I will not, Sir, as your time is precious, detain you here, but, as &s;oon as it is in my power, I will wait upon you in the city."</Q></P>

Here Mr. Delvile, who felt him&s;elf in|&s;ulted in a manner he could lea&s;t &s;upport, after looking at him very di&s;dainfully, turned to Cecilia, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Bever|ley, if this per&s;on wi&s;hes for a longer con|ference with you, I am &s;orry you did not appoint a more &s;ea&s;onable hour for your interview."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir!"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, with a look meant to be nothing le&s;s than petrific.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What!"</Q> cried he, with an arch leer; <Q REND="inline">"all above it, hay? warrant your Spani&s;h Don never thinks of &s;uch a thing! don't believe 'em my duck! great cry and little wool; no more of the ready than other folks; mere puff and go one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is language, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o utterly incomprehen&s;ible, that I pre&s;ume you do not even intend it &s;hould be under&s;tood: otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould very little &s;cruple to inform you, that no man of the name of Delvile brooks the &s;malle&s;t in&s;inua|tion of di&s;honour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't he?"</Q> returned Mr. Briggs, with a grin; <Q REND="inline">"why how will he help it? will the old grandees jump up out of their graves to frighten us?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234">
<Q REND="inline">"What old grandees, Sir? to whom are you plea&s;ed to allude?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why all them old grandfathers and aunts you brag of; a &s;et of poor &s;ouls you won't let re&s;t in their coffins; mere clay and dirt! fine things to be proud of! a parcel of old mouldy rubbi&s;h quite departed this life! raking up bones and du&s;t, nobody knows for what! ought to be a&s;hamed; who cares for dead carca&s;es? nothing but carion.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I can &s;o ill make out, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid the a&s;toni&s;hed Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"what this per&s;on is plea&s;ed to dive at, that I cannot pretend to enter into any &s;ort of conver&s;a|tion with him; you will therefore be &s;o good as to let me know when he has fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, and you are at lei&s;ure to &s;et off."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with a very &s;tately air, he was quitting the room; but was &s;oon &s;topt, upon Mr. Briggs' calling out <Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, Don Duke, poke in the old charnel hou&s;es by your&s;elf, none of your defunct for me! did n't care if they were all hung in a &s;tring.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir,"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, turning round, <Q REND="inline">"to whom were you plea&s;ed to ad|dre&s;s that &s;peech?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Never mind, old Don,"</Q> cried Briggs, with a facetious nod, <Q REND="inline">"Know me better another time!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Old who, Sir!&mdash;what!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="236">
<Q REND="inline">"Come to a fair reckoning,"</Q> continued Mr. Briggs; <Q REND="inline">"&s;uppo&s;e you were in my ca&s;e, and had never a farthing but of your own getting; where would you be then? What would become of your fine coach and hor&s;es? you might &s;tump your feet off be|fore you'd ever get into one. Where would be all this fine crockery work for your breakfa&s;t? you might pop your head under a pump, or drink out of your own paw; What would you do for that fine jemmy tye? Where would you get a gold head to your &s;tick? You might dig long enough in them cold vaults before any of your old grand|fathers would pop out to give you one."</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Delvile, feeling more enraged than he thought &s;uited his dignity, re&s;train|ed him&s;elf from making any further an&s;wer, but going up to the bell, rang it with great violence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And as to ringing a bell,"</Q> continued Mr. Briggs, <Q REND="inline">"you'd never know what it was in your life, unle&s;s could make intere&s;t to be a du&s;t-man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A du&s;t-man!"</Q>&mdash;repeated Mr. Del|vile, unable to command his &s;ilence longer, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t&mdash;"</Q> and biting his lips, he &s;topt &s;hort.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, love it, don't you? &s;uits your ta&s;te; why not one du&s;t as well as another?
<PB N="238" REF="237">
Du&s;t in a cart good as du&s;t of a charnel|hou&s;e; don't &s;mell half &s;o bad."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant now entering, Mr. Delvile cal|led out <Q REND="inline">"Is every thing ready?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>He then begged Mrs. Delvile to go into the coach, and telling Cecilia to follow when at lei&s;ure, left the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will come immediately, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Briggs, I am &s;orry to leave you, and much concerned you have had this trouble; but I can detain Mr. Delvile no longer."</Q></P>
<P>And then away &s;he ran, notwith&s;tanding he repeatedly charged her to &s;tay. He fol|lowed them, however, to the coach, with bitter revilings that every body was to make more of his ward than him&s;elf, and with the mo&s;t virulent complaints of his lo&s;&s;es from the blanket, the brea&s;t of mutton, the crabs and the lob&s;ter!</P>
<P>Nothing, however, more was &s;aid to him; Cecilia, as if &s;he had not heard him, only bowed her head, and the coach driving off, they &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>This incident by no means rendered the journey plea&s;ant, or Mr. Delvile gracious: his own dignity, that con&s;tant object of his thoughts and his cares, had received a wound from this attack which he had not
<PB N="239" REF="238">
the &s;en&s;e to de&s;pi&s;e; and the vulgarity and impudence of Mr. Briggs, which ought to have made his familiarity and boldne&s;s equally contemptible and ridiculous, &s;erved only with a man who&s;e pride out-run his under&s;tanding, to render them doubly morti|fying and &s;tinging. He could talk, there|fore, of nothing the whole way that they went, but the extreme impropriety of which the Dean of &mdash; had been guilty, in expo&s;|ing him to &s;cenes and &s;ituations &s;o much beneath his Rank, by leaguing him with a <HI>per&s;on</HI> &s;o coar&s;e and di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>They &s;lept one night upon the road, and arrived the next day at Delvile Ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN ANTIQUE MANSION.</HEAD>
<P>DELVILE Ca&s;tle was &s;ituated in a large and woody park, and &s;urround|ed by a moat. A draw-bridge which front|ed the entrance was every night, by order of Mr. Delvile, with the &s;ame care as if &s;till nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the family, regularly drawn up. Some fortifications &s;till remained entire, and ve&s;tiges were every where to be traced of more; no ta&s;te was &s;hewn in the di&s;po&s;ition of the grounds, no openings were contrived through the wood for di&s;tant views or beautiful objects: the man&s;ion-hou&s;e was ancient, large and mag|nificent, but con&s;tructed with as little atten|tion to convenience and comfort, as to airi|ne&s;s and elegance; it was dark, heavy and mona&s;tic, equally in want of repair and of improvement. The grandeur of its former inhabitants was every where vi&s;ible, but the decay into which it was falling rendered &s;uch remains mere objects for meditation and melancholy; while the evident &s;truggle to &s;upport &s;ome appearance of its ancient
<PB N="241" REF="240">
dignity, made the dwelling and all in it's vicinity wear an a&s;pect of con&s;traint and au|&s;terity. Fe&s;tivity, joy and plea&s;ure, &s;eemed foreign to the purpo&s;es of it's con&s;truction; &s;ilence, &s;olemnity and contemplation were adapted to it only.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, however, took all po&s;&s;ible care to make the apartments and &s;ituation of Cecilia commodious and plea&s;ant, and to bani&s;h by her kindne&s;s and animation the gloom and formality which her man&s;ion in&s;pired. Nor were her efforts ungratefully received; Cecilia, charmed by every mark of attention from a woman &s;he &s;o highly admired, returned her &s;olicitude by encrea&s;|ing affection, and repaid all her care by the revival of her &s;pirits. She was happy, in|deed, to have quitted the di&s;orderly hou&s;e of Mr. Harrel, where terror, &s;o continually awakened, was only to be lulled by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;ition; and though her mind, depre&s;&s;ed by what was pa&s;&s;ed, and in &s;u&s;|pence with what was to come, was by no means in a &s;tate for uninterrupted enjoy|ment, yet to find her&s;elf placed, at la&s;t, without effort or impropriety, in the very man&s;ion &s;he had &s;o long con&s;idered as her road to happine&s;s, rendered her, notwith|&s;tanding her remaining &s;ources of inquie|tude, more contented than &s;he had yet felt her&s;elf &s;ince her departure from Suffolk.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="241">
Even the imperious Mr. Delvile was more &s;upportable here than in London: &s;ecure in his own ca&s;tle, he looked around him with a pride of power and of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which &s;oftened while it &s;welled him. His &s;uperiority was undi&s;puted, his will was without controul. He was not, as in the great capital of the kingdom, &s;urrounded by competitors; no rivalry di&s;turbed his peace, no equality mortified his greatne&s;s; all he &s;aw were either va&s;&s;als of his power, or gue&s;ts bending to his plea&s;ure; he abat|ed therefore, con&s;iderably, the &s;tern gloom of his haughtine&s;s, and &s;oothed his proud mind by the courte&s;y of conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little, however, was the opportunity Ce|cilia found, for evincing that &s;pirit and for|bearance &s;he had planned in relation to Del|vile; he breakfa&s;ted by him&s;elf every morn|ing, rode or walked out alone till driven home by the heat of the day, and &s;pent the re&s;t of his time till dinner in his own &s;tudy. When he then appeared, his conver&s;ation was always general, and his attention not more engaged by Cecilia than by his mo|ther. Left by them with his father, &s;ome|times he appeared again at tea-time, but more commonly he rode or &s;trolled out to &s;ome neighbouring family, and it was al|ways uncertain whether he was again &s;een before dinner the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="242">
By this conduct, re&s;erve on her part was rendered totally unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;he could give no di&s;couragement where &s;he met with no a&s;&s;iduity; &s;he had no occa&s;ion to fly where &s;he was never pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Strange, however, &s;he thought &s;uch be|haviour, and utterly impo&s;&s;ible to be the effect of accident; his de&s;ire to avoid her &s;eemed &s;crupulous and pointed, and how|ever to the world it might wear the ap|pearance of chance, to her watchful anxie|ty a thou&s;and circum&s;tances marked it for de&s;ign. She found that his friends at home had never &s;een &s;o little of him, complaints were continually made of his frequent ab|&s;ences, and much &s;urpri&s;e was expre&s;&s;ed at his new manner of life, and what might be the occupations which &s;o &s;trangely engro&s;|&s;ed his time.</P>
<P>Had her heart not interfered in this mat|ter, &s;he might now have been perfectly at re&s;t, &s;ince &s;he was &s;pared the renunciation &s;he had projected, and &s;ince, without either mental exertion or per&s;onal trouble, the af|fair &s;eemed totally dropt, and Delvile, far from manife&s;ting any de&s;ign of conque&s;t, &s;hunned all occa&s;ions of gallantry, and &s;e|dulou&s;ly avoided even common conver&s;ation with her. If he &s;aw her preparing to walk out in an evening, he was certain to &s;tay at home; if his mother was with her, and in|vited
<PB N="244" REF="243">
him to join them, he was &s;ure to be ready with &s;ome other engagement; and if by accident he met her in the park, he merely &s;topt to &s;peak of the weather, bow|ed, and hurried on.</P>
<P>How to reconcile a coldne&s;s &s;o extraor|dinary with a fervour &s;o animated as that which he had lately &s;hewn, was indeed not ea&s;y; &s;ometimes &s;he fancied he had entang|led not only the poor Henrietta but him&s;elf, at other times &s;he believed him merely ca|pricious; but that he &s;tudied to avoid her &s;he was convinced invariably, and &s;uch a conviction was alone &s;ufficient to determine her upon forwarding his purpo&s;e. And, when her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e was over, and fir&s;t chagrin abated, her own pride came to her aid, and &s;he re&s;olved to u&s;e every method in her power to conquer a partiality &s;o un|gratefully be&s;towed. She rejoiced that in no in&s;tance &s;he had ever betrayed it, and &s;he &s;aw that his own behaviour prevented all &s;u&s;picion of it in the family. Yet, in the mid&s;t of her mortification and di&s;plea|&s;ure, &s;he found &s;ome con&s;olation in &s;eeing that tho&s;e mercenary views of which &s;he had once been led to accu&s;e him, were far|the&s;t from his thoughts, and that whatever was the &s;tate of his mind, &s;he had no arti|fice to apprehend, nor de&s;ign to guard again&s;t. All therefore that remained was to
<PB N="245" REF="244">
imitate his example, be civil and formal, &s;hun all interviews that were not public, and decline all di&s;cour&s;e but what good breeding occa&s;ionally made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means their meetings became more rare than ever, and of &s;horter duration, for if one by any accident was detained, the other retired; till, by their mutual dili|gence, they &s;oon only &s;aw each other at dinner: and though neither of them knew the motives or the intentions of the other, the be&s;t concerted agreement could not more effectually have &s;eparated them.</P>
<P>This ta&s;k to Cecilia was at fir&s;t extreme|ly painful; but time and con&s;tancy of mind &s;oon le&s;&s;ened its difficulty. She amu&s;ed her&s;elf with walking and reading, &s;he com|mi&s;&s;ioned Mr. Monckton to &s;end her a Piano Forte of Merlin's, &s;he was fond of fine work, and &s;he found in the conver&s;ation of Mrs. Delvile a never-failing re&s;ource again&s;t languor and &s;adne&s;s. Leaving there|fore to him&s;elf her my&s;terious &s;on, &s;he wi&s;e|ly re&s;olved to find other employment for her thoughts, than conjectures with which &s;he could not be &s;atisfied, and doubts that might never be explained.</P>
<P>Very few families vi&s;ited at the ca&s;tle, and fewer &s;till had their vi&s;its returned. The arrogance of Mr. Delvile had offend|ed all the neighbouring gentry, who could
<PB N="246" REF="245">
ea&s;ily be better entertained than by receiv|ing in&s;tructions of their own inferiority, which however readily they might allow, was by no means &s;o plea&s;ant a &s;ubject as to recompen&s;e them for hearing no other. And if Mr. Delvile was &s;hunned through hatred, his lady no le&s;s was avoided through fear; high-&s;pirited and fa&s;tidious, &s;he was ea&s;ily wearied and di&s;gu&s;ted, &s;he bore neither with frailty nor folly&mdash;tho&s;e two principal in|gredients in human nature! She required, to obtain her favour, the union of virtue and abilities with elegance, which meeting but rarely, &s;he was rarely di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ed; and di&s;daining to conceal either contempt or aver&s;ion, &s;he in&s;pired in return nothing but dread or re&s;entment: making thus, by a want of that lenity which is the <HI>milk of human kindne&s;s,</HI> and the bond of &s;o|ciety, enemies the mo&s;t numerous and illi|beral by tho&s;e very talents which, more <HI>meekly borne,</HI> would have rendered her not merely admired, but adored!</P>
<P>In proportion, however, as &s;he was thus at war with the world in general, the cho|&s;en few who were honoured with her favour, &s;he loved with a zeal all her own; her heart, liberal, open, and but too daringly &s;incere, was fervent in affection, and enthu|&s;ia&s;tic in admiration; the friends who were dear to her, &s;he was devoted to &s;erve, &s;he
<PB N="247" REF="246">
magnified their virtues till &s;he thought them of an higher race of beings, &s;he inflamed her genero&s;ity with ideas of what &s;he owed to them, till her life &s;eemed too &s;mall a &s;a|crifice to be refu&s;ed for their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Such was the love which already &s;he felt for Cecilia; her countenance had &s;truck, her manners had charmed her, her under|&s;tanding was di&s;played by the quick intel|ligence of her eyes, and every action and every notion &s;poke her mind the &s;eat of elegance. In &s;ecret &s;he &s;ometimes regretted that &s;he was not higher born, but that regret always vani&s;hed when &s;he &s;aw and conver&s;|ed with her.</P>
<P>Her own youth had been pa&s;&s;ed in all the &s;everity of affliction: &s;he had been married to Mr. Delvile by her relations, without any con&s;ultation of her heart or her will. Her &s;trong mind di&s;dained u&s;ele&s;s com|plaints, yet her di&s;content, however private, was deep. Ardent in her di&s;po&s;ition, and naturally violent in her pa&s;&s;ions, her feel|ings were extremely acute, and to curb them by rea&s;on and principle had been the chief and hard &s;tudy of her life. The effort had calmed, though it had not made her happy. To love Mr. Delvile &s;he felt was impo&s;&s;ible; proud without merit, and imperious without capacity, &s;he &s;aw with bitterne&s;s the inferiority of his faculties,
<PB N="248" REF="247">
and &s;he found in his temper no qualities to endear or attract: yet &s;he re&s;pected his birth and his family, of which her own was a branch, and whatever was her mi&s;ery from the connection, &s;he &s;teadily behaved to him with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety.</P>
<P>Her &s;on, however, when &s;he was ble&s;&s;ed with his pre&s;ence, had a power over her mind that mitigated all her &s;orrows, and al|mo&s;t lulled even her wi&s;hes to &s;leep: &s;he rather idoli&s;ed than loved him, yet her fond|ne&s;s flowed not from relation&s;hip, but from his worth and his character, his talents and his di&s;po&s;ition. She &s;aw in him, indeed, all her own virtues and excellencies, with a toleration for the imperfections of others to which &s;he was wholly a &s;tranger. What|ever was great or good &s;he expected him to perform; occa&s;ion alone &s;he thought want|ing to manife&s;t him the fir&s;t of human beings.</P>
<P>Nor here was Mr. Delvile him&s;elf le&s;s &s;anguine in his hopes: his &s;on was not only the fir&s;t object of his affection, but the chief idol of his pride, and he did not merely cheri&s;h but reverence him as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the only &s;upport of his ancient name and family, without who&s;e life and health the whole race would be extinct. He con&s;ult|ed him in all his affairs, never mentioned him but with di&s;tinction, and expected the whole world to bow down before him.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="248">
Delvile in his behaviour to his father imitated the conduct of his mother, who oppo&s;ed him in nothing when his plea&s;ure was made known, but who forbore to en|quire into his opinion except in cafes of ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Their minds, indeed, were totally di&s;&s;imilar; and Delvile well knew that if he &s;ubmitted to his directions, he mu&s;t demand &s;uch re&s;pect as the world would refu&s;e with indignation, and &s;carcely &s;peak to a man who&s;e genealogy was not known to him.</P>
<P>But though duty and gratitude were the only ties that bound him to his father, he loved his mother not merely with filial af|fection, but with the pure&s;t e&s;teem and highe&s;t reverence; he knew, too, that while without him her exi&s;tence would be a bur|then, her tenderne&s;s was no effu&s;ion of weak partiality, but founded on the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his worth; and however to maternal indulgence its origin might be owing, the rectitude of his own conduct could alone &s;ave it from diminution.</P>
<P>Such was the hou&s;e in which Cecilia was now &s;ettled, and with which &s;he lived al|mo&s;t to the exclu&s;ion of the &s;ight of any other; for though &s;he had now been three weeks at the ca&s;tle, &s;he had only at church &s;een any family but the Delviles.</P>
<P>Nor did any thing in the cour&s;e of that time occur to her, but the reception of a melancholy letter from Mrs. Harrel, filled
<PB N="250" REF="249">
with complaints of her retirement and mi|&s;ery; and another from Mr. Arnott, with an account of the funeral, the difficulties he had had to encounter with the creditors, who had even &s;eized the dead body, and the numerous expences in which he had been involved, by petitions he could not with&s;tand, from the meaner and more clamorous of tho&s;e whom his late brother-in-law had left unpaid. He concluded with a pathetic prayer for her happine&s;s, and a declaration that his own was lo&s;t for ever, &s;ince now he was even deprived of her &s;ight. Cecilia wrote an affectionate an&s;wer to Mrs. Har|rel, promi&s;ing, when fully at liberty, that &s;he would her&s;elf fetch her to her own hou&s;e in Suffolk: but &s;he could only &s;end her compliments to Mr. Arnott, though her compa&s;&s;ion urged a kinder me&s;&s;age; as &s;he feared even a &s;hadow of encouragement to &s;o &s;erious, yet hopele&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A RATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time, the hou&s;e was much en|livened by a vi&s;it from Lady Honoria Pemberton, who came to &s;pend a month with Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<P>Cecilia had now but little lei&s;ure, for Lady Honoria would hardly re&s;t a moment away from her; &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon walking with her, &s;itting with her, working with her, and &s;inging with her; whatever &s;he did, &s;he cho&s;e to do al&s;o; wherever &s;he went, &s;he was bent upon accompanying her; and Mrs. Delvile, who wi&s;hed her well, though &s;he had no patience with her foibles, encou|raged this intimacy from the hope it might do her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It was not, however, that Lady Hono|ria had conceived any regard for Cecilia; on the contrary, had &s;he been told &s;he &s;hould &s;ee her no more, &s;he would have heard it with the &s;ame compo&s;ure as if &s;he had been told &s;he &s;hould meet with her daily: &s;he had no motive for pur&s;uing her but
<PB N="252" REF="251">
that &s;he had nothing el&s;e to do, and no fond|ne&s;s for her &s;ociety but what re&s;ulted from aver&s;ion to &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria had received a fa&s;hion|able education, in which her proficiency had been equal to what fa&s;hion made re|qui&s;ite; &s;he &s;ung a little, played the harp|&s;ichord a little, painted a little, worked a little, and danced a great deal. She had quick parts and high &s;pirits, though her mind was uncultivated, and &s;he was totally void of judgment or di&s;cretion: &s;he was carele&s;s of giving offence, and indifferent to all that was thought of her; the delight of her life was to create wonder by her rattle, and whether that wonder was to her advantage or di&s;credit, &s;he did not for a moment trouble her&s;elf to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>A character of &s;o much levity with &s;o little heart had no great chance of rai&s;ing e&s;teem or regard in Cecilia, who at almo&s;t any other period of her life would have been wearied of her importunate attendance; but at pre&s;ent, the un&s;ettled &s;tate of her own mind made her glad to give it any employ|ment, and the &s;prightline&s;s of Lady Hono|ria &s;erved therefore to amu&s;e her. Yet &s;he could not forbear being hurt by finding that the behaviour of Delvile was &s;o ex|actly the &s;ame to them both, that any com|mon
<PB N="253" REF="252">
ob&s;erver would with difficulty have pronounced which he preferred.</P>
<P>One morning about a week after her lady|&s;hip's arrival at the ca&s;tle, &s;he came running into Cecilia's room, &s;aying &s;he had very good news for her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A charming opening!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"pray tell it me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why my Lord Derford is coming!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O what a melancholy dearth of inci|dent,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if this is your be&s;t intelligence!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why it's better than nothing: better than going to &s;leep over a family-party; and I vow I have &s;ometimes &s;uch difficulty to keep awake, that I am frightened to death le&s;t I &s;hould be taken with a &s;udden nap, and affront them all. Now pray &s;peak the truth without &s;qeami&s;hne&s;s, don't you find it very terrible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I find nothing very terrible with Mrs. Delvile."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I like Mrs. Delvile, too, of all things, for I believe &s;he's the clevere&s;t wo|man in the world; but then I know &s;he does not like me, &s;o there's no being very fond of her. Be&s;ides, really, if I admired her as much again, I &s;hould be dreadfully tired of &s;eeing nothing el&s;e. She never &s;tirs out, you know, and has no company at home, which is an extremely tire&s;ome plan,
<PB N="254" REF="253">
for it only &s;erves to make us all doubly &s;ick of one another: though you mu&s;t know it's one great rea&s;on why my father likes I &s;hould come; for he has &s;ome very old-fa&s;hioned notions, though I take a great deal of pains to make him get the better of them. But I am always exce&s;|&s;ively rejoiced when the vi&s;it has been paid, for I am obliged to come every year. I don't mean <HI>now,</HI> indeed, becau&s;e your being here makes it va&s;tly more tolerable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me much honour,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, laughing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But really, when my Lord Derford comes, it can't po&s;&s;ibly be quite &s;o bad, for at lea&s;t there will be &s;omething el&s;e to look at; and you mu&s;t know my eyes tire extremely of always &s;eeing the &s;ame objects. And we can a&s;k him, too, for a little news, and that will put Mrs. Delvile in a pa&s;&s;ion, which will help to give us a little &s;pirit: though I know we &s;hall not get the &s;malle&s;t intelligence from him, for he knows nothing in the world that's going forward. And, indeed, that's no great matter, for if he did, he would not know how to tell it, he's &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;illy. However, I &s;hall a&s;k him all &s;ort of things, for the le&s;s he can an&s;wer, the more it will plague him; and I like to plague a fool amazingly, becau&s;e he can never plague
<PB N="255" REF="254">
one again.&mdash;Though really I ought to beg your pardon, for he is one of your admi|rers."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray make no &s;tranger of me! you have my free con&s;ent to &s;ay whatever you plea&s;e of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, then, I like my old Lord Ernolf the be&s;t of the two, for he has a thou&s;and times more &s;en&s;e than his &s;on, and upon my word I don't think he is much uglier. But I wonder va&s;tly you would not marry him, for all that, for you might have done exactly what you plea&s;ed with him, which, all together, would have been no inconvenient circum&s;tance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When I want a pupil,"</Q> an&s;wered Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall think that an admirable re|commendation: but were I to marry, I would rather find a tutor, of the two."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I &s;hould not,"</Q> cried lady Honoria, carele&s;sly, <Q REND="inline">"for one has enough to do with tutors before hand, and the be&s;t thing I know of marrying is to get rid of them. I fancy you think &s;o too, only it's a pretty &s;peech to make. Oh how my &s;i&s;|ter Euphra&s;ia would adore you!&mdash;Pray are you always as grave as you are now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;yes,&mdash;indeed I hardly know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fancy it's this di&s;mal place that hurts your &s;pirits. I remember when I &s;aw you in St. James's-&s;quare I thouht you very
<PB N="256" REF="255">
lively. But really the&s;e thick walls are enough to in&s;pire the vapours if one never had them before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't think they have had a very bad effect upon your lady&s;hip!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes they have; if Euphra&s;ia was here &s;he would hardly know me. And the extreme want of ta&s;te and entertainment in all the family is quite melancholy: for even if by chance one has the good fortune to hear any intelligence, Mrs. Delvile will hardly let it be repeated, for fear it &s;hould happen to be untrue, as if that could po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ignify! I am &s;ure I had as lieve the things were fal&s;e as not, for they tell as well one way as the other, if &s;he would but have patience to hear them. But &s;he's ex|tremely &s;evere, you know, as almo&s;t all tho&s;e very clever women are; &s;o that &s;he keeps a kind of re&s;traint upon me whether I will or no. However, that's nothing com|pared to her <HI>caro &s;po&s;o,</HI> for he is utterly in|&s;ufferable; &s;o &s;olemn, and &s;o dull! &s;o &s;tate|ly and &s;o tire&s;ome! Mortimer, too, gets wor&s;e and wor&s;e; O 'tis a &s;ad tribe! I dare &s;ay he will &s;oon grow quite as horrible as his father. Don' you think &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed,&mdash;no,&mdash;I don't think there's much re&s;emblance,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with &s;ome he&s;itation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is the mo&s;t altered creature,"</Q> con|tinued
<PB N="257" REF="256">
her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"I ever &s;aw in my life. Once I thought him the mo&s;t agree|able young man in the world: but if you ob&s;erve, that's all over now, and he is get|ting ju&s;t as &s;tupid and di&s;mal as the re&s;t of them. I wi&s;h you had been here la&s;t &s;ummer; I a&s;&s;ure you, you would quite have fallen in love with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Should I?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with a con|&s;cious &s;mile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, for he was quite delightful; all &s;pirit and gaitey; but now, if it was not for you, I really think I &s;hould pretend to lo&s;e my way, and in&s;tead of going over that old draw-bridge, throw my&s;elf into the moat. I wi&s;h Euphra&s;ia was here. It's ju&s;t the right place for her. She'll fancy her&s;elf in a mona&s;try as &s;oon as &s;he comes, and nothing will make her half &s;o happy, for &s;he is always wi&s;hing to be a Nun, poor little &s;impleton.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is there any chance that Lady Euphra|&s;ia may come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, &s;he can't at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it would not be proper: but I mean if ever &s;he is married to Mortimer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Married to him!"</Q> repeated Cecilia, in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, my dear,"</Q> cried Lady Ho|noria, looking at her very archly, <Q REND="inline">"you intend to be married to him your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257">
<Q REND="inline">"Me? no, indeed!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You look very guilty, though,"</Q> cried &s;he laughing, <Q REND="inline">"and indeed when you came hither, every body &s;aid that the whole affair was arranged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For &s;hame, Lady Honoria!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, again changing colour, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure this mu&s;t be your own fancy,&mdash;in|vention,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I a&s;&s;ure you; I heard it at &s;eve|ral places; and every body &s;aid how char|mingly your fortune would build up all the&s;e old fortifications: but &s;ome people &s;aid they knew Mr. Harrel had &s;old you to Mr. Marriot, and that if you married Mortimer, there would be a law-&s;uit that would take away half your e&s;tate; and others &s;aid you had promi&s;ed your hand to Sir Robert Floyer, and repented when you heard of his mortgages, and he gave it out every where that he would fight any man that pretended to you; and then again &s;ome &s;aid that you were all the time privately married to Mr. Arnott, but did not dare own it, becau&s;e he was &s;o afraid of fight|ing with Sir Robert."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lady Honoria!"</Q> cried Cecilia, half laughing, <Q REND="inline">"what wild inventions are the&s;e! and all I hope, your own?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, they were current over the whole town. But don't take any notice
<PB N="259" REF="258">
of what I told you about Euphrafia, for perhaps, it may never happen."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, reviving by believing it all fiction, <Q REND="inline">"it has never been in agitation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes; it is negociating at this very moment, I believe, among the higher pow|ers; only Mr. Delvile does not yet know whether Euphra&s;ia has fortune enough for what he wants."</Q></P>
<P>Ah, thought Cecilia, how do I rejoice that my independent &s;ituation exempts me from being di&s;po&s;ed of for life, by thus being &s;et up to &s;ale!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They thought of me, once, for Mor|timer,</Q> "continued Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"but I'm va&s;tly glad that's over, for I never &s;hould have &s;urvived being &s;hut up in this place; it's much fitter for Euphra&s;ia. To tell you the truth, I believe they could not make out money enough; but Euphra&s;ia has a fortune of her own, be&s;ides what we &s;hall have together, for Grandmama left her every thing that was in her own power."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is Lady Euphra&s;ia your elder &s;i&s;ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, poor little thing, &s;he's two years younger. Grandmama brought her up, and &s;he has &s;een nothing at all of the world, for &s;he has never been pre&s;ented yet, &s;o &s;he is not <HI>come out,</HI> you know: but &s;he's to
<PB N="260" REF="259">
come out next year. However, &s;he once &s;aw Mortimer, but &s;he did not like him at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not like him!"</Q> cried Cecilia, greatly &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, &s;he thought him too gay,&mdash;Oh dear, I wi&s;h &s;he could &s;ee him now! I am &s;ure I hope &s;he would find him &s;ad enough! &s;he is the mo&s;t formal little grave thing you ever beheld: &s;he'll preach to you &s;ometimes for half an hour together. Grand|mama taught her nothing in the world but to &s;ay her prayers, &s;o that almo&s;t every other word you &s;ay, &s;he thinks is quite wicked.</Q></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was now interrupted by their &s;eparating to dre&s;s for dinner. It left Cecilia in much perplexity; &s;he knew not what wholly to credit, or wholly to di&s;believe; but her chief concern aro&s;e from the unfortunate change of counte|nance which Lady Honoria had been &s;o quick in ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>The next time &s;he was alone with Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"has your little rattling tormentor acquainted you who is coming?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Derford, do you mean, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, with his father; &s;hall you di&s;like to &s;ee them?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">
<Q REND="inline">"Not if, as I hope, they come merely to wait upon you and Mr. Delvile."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile and my&s;elf,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"will certainly have the honour of <HI>receiving</HI> them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Ernolf,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia," <Q REND="inline">can ne|ver &s;uppo&s;e his vi&s;it will make any change in me; I have been very explicit with him, and he &s;eemed equally rational and well bred in forbearing any importunity upon the &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It has however been much believed in town,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that you were &s;trangely &s;hackled by Mr. Harrel, and therefore his lord&s;hip may probably hope that a change in your &s;ituation may be followed by a change in his favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be &s;orry if he does,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for he will then find him&s;elf much deceived."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are right, very right,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"to be difficult in your choice, and to take time for looking around you before you make any. I have forborn all que&s;tions upon this &s;ubject, le&s;t you &s;hould find any reluctance in an&s;wering them; but I am now too deeply intere&s;ted in your wel|fare to be contented in total ignorance of your de&s;igns: will you, then, &s;uffer me to make a few enquiries?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia gave a ready, but blu&s;hing a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="261">
<Q REND="inline">"Tell me, then, of the many admirers who have graced your train, which there is you have di&s;tingui&s;hed with any intention of future preference?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not one, madam!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, out of &s;o many, is there not one that, hereafter, you mean to di&s;tingui&s;h?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;haking her head, <Q REND="inline">"many as they may &s;eem, I have little rea&s;on to be proud of them; there is one only who, had my fortune been &s;maller, would, I believe, ever have thought of me, and there is <HI>one</HI> only, who, were it now dimini&s;hed, would ever think of me more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This &s;incerity,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is ju&s;t what I expected from you. There is, then, <HI>one?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe there is,&mdash;and the worthy Mr. Arnott is the man; I am much indeed deceived, if his partiality for me is not truly di&s;intere&s;ted, and I almo&s;t wi&s;h&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, my love?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I could return it more grate|fully!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;I cannot! I e&s;teem him, I have the true&s;t regard for his character, and were I now by any fatal nece&s;&s;ity, compel|led to belong to any one of tho&s;e who have been plea&s;ed to addre&s;s me, I &s;hould not
<PB N="263" REF="262">
he&s;itate a moment in &s;hewing him my gra|titude; but yet, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, &s;uch a proof of it would render me very mi&s;erable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may perhaps think &s;o now,"</Q> re|turned Mrs. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"but with &s;entiments &s;o &s;trongly in his favour, you will proba|bly be led hereafter to pity&mdash;and ac|cept him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, madam;" I pretend not, I own, to open my whole heart to you;&mdash;I know not that you would have pa|tience, for &s;o unintere&s;ting a detail; but though there are &s;ome things I venture not to mention, there is nothing, believe me, in which I will deceive you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I <HI>do</HI> believe you,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, embracing her; <Q REND="inline">"and the more readily becau&s;e, not merely among your avowed admirers, but among the whole race of men, I &s;carce know one to whom I &s;hould think you worthily con&s;igned!"</Q></P>
<P>Ah! thought Cecilia, that &s;carce! who may it mean to except?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;hew you,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that I will de&s;erve your confidence in future, I will refrain from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing you by any fur|ther que&s;tions at pre&s;ent: you will not, I think, act materially without con&s;ulting me, and for your thoughts&mdash;it were tyranny,
<PB N="264" REF="263">
not friendi&s;hp, to inve&s;tigate them more narrowly."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia's gratitude for this delicacy, would in&s;tantly have induced her to tell every &s;ecret of her &s;oul, had &s;he not apprehended &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion would have &s;eemed &s;oli|citing her intere&s;t and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the only affair in which &s;he would have di&s;|dained even to receive them.</P>
<P>She thanked her, therefore, for her kind|ne&s;s, and the conver&s;ation was dropt; &s;he much wi&s;hed to have known whether the&s;e enquiries &s;prung &s;imply from friendly curi|o&s;ity, or whether &s;he was de&s;irous from any nearer motive to be &s;atisfied with re&s;pect to her freedom or engagements. This, how|ever, &s;he had no method of di&s;covering, and was therefore compelled to wait quiet|ly till time &s;hould make it clear.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A STORM.</HEAD>
<P>ONE evening about this time, which was the latter end of July, Lady Honoria and Cecilia deferred walking out till very late, and then found it &s;o plea&s;ant, that they had &s;trolled into the Park two miles from the hou&s;e, when they were met by young Delvile; who, however, only reminded them how far they had to return, and walked on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He grows quite intolerable!"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, when he was gone; <Q REND="inline">"it's really a melancholy thing to &s;ee a young man behave &s;o like an old Monk. I dare &s;ay in another week he won't take off his hat to us; and, in about a fortnight, I &s;uppo&s;e he'll &s;hut him&s;elf up in one of tho&s;e little round towers, and &s;have his head, and live upon roots, and howl if any body comes near him. I really half wonder he does not think it too di&s;&s;ipated to let Fidel run after him &s;o. A thou&s;and to one but he &s;hoots him &s;ome day for giving a &s;udden bark when he's in one of the&s;e gloomy fits.
<PB N="266" REF="265">
Something, however, mu&s;t certainly be the matter with him. Perhaps he is in love."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can nothing be the matter with him but that?"</Q> cried Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, I don't know; but I am &s;ure if he is, his Mi&s;tre&s;s has not much occa&s;ion to be jealous of you or me, for never, I think, were two poor Dam&s;els &s;o neglect|ed!"</Q></P>
<P>The utmo&s;t art of malice could not have furni&s;hed a &s;peech more truly morti|fying to Cecilia than this thoughtle&s;s and accidental &s;ally of Lady Honoria's: par|ticularly, however, upon her guard, from the raillery &s;he had already endured, &s;he an&s;wered, with apparent indifference, <Q REND="inline">"he is meditating, perhaps, upon Lady Eu|phra&s;ia."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"for he did not take any notice of her when he &s;aw her; I am &s;ure if he marries her, it will only be becau&s;e he cannot help it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor Lady Euphra&s;ia!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, not at all; he'll make her two or three fine &s;peeches, and then &s;he'll be perfectly contented: e&s;pecially if he looks as di&s;mally at her as he does at us! and that probably he will do the more rea|dily for not liking to look at her at all. But &s;he's &s;uch a romantic little thing, &s;he'll never &s;u&s;pect him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="266">
Here they were &s;omewhat alarmed by a &s;udden darkne&s;s in the air, which was pre|&s;ently &s;ucceeded by a thunder &s;torm; they in&s;tantly turned back, and began running home, when a violent &s;hower of rain obli|ged them to take &s;helter under a large tree; where in two minutes they were joined by Delvile, who came to offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in hurrying them home; and finding the thunder and lightening continue, begged them to move on, in defiance of the rain, as their pre&s;ent &s;ituation expo&s;ed them to more danger than a wet hat and cloak, which might be changed in a moment.</P>
<P>Cecilia readily a&s;&s;ented; but Lady Ho|noria, extremely frightened, prote&s;ted &s;he would not &s;tir till the &s;torm was over. It was in vain he repre&s;ented her mi&s;take in &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf in a place of &s;ecurity; &s;he clung to the tree, &s;creamed at every fla&s;h of lightening, and all her gay &s;pirits were lo&s;t in her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Delvile then earne&s;tly propo&s;ed to Ceci|lia conducting her home by her&s;elf, and re|turning again to Lady Honoria; but &s;he thought it wrong to quit her companion, and hardly right to accept his a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;eparately. They waited, therefore, &s;ome time all together; but the &s;torm encrea&s;ing with great violence, the thunder growing louder, and the lightning becoming &s;tronger,
<PB N="268" REF="267">
Delvile grew impatient even to anger at Lady Honoria's re&s;i&s;tance, and warmly expo&s;tulated upon its folly and danger. But the pre&s;ent was no &s;ea&s;on for le&s;&s;ons in philo&s;ophy; prejudices &s;he had never been taught to &s;urmount made her think her&s;elf in a place of &s;afety, and &s;he was now too much terrified to give argument fair play.</P>
<P>Finding her thus impracticable, Delvile eagerly &s;aid to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Come then, Mi&s;s Beverley, let us wait no longer; I will &s;ee you home, and then return to Lady Honoria."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"my life is not more precious than either of yours, and therefore it may run the &s;ame ri&s;k."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is more precious,"</Q> cried he with ve|hemence, <Q REND="inline">"than the air I breathe!"</Q> and &s;eizing her hand, he drew it under his arm, and, without waiting her con&s;ent, almo&s;t forced her away with him, &s;aying as they ran, <Q REND="inline">"How could a thou&s;and Lady Honoria's recompence the world for the lo&s;s of one Mi&s;s Beverley? we may, in|deed, find many thou&s;and &s;uch as Lady Honoria, but &s;uch as Mi&s;s Beverley&mdash;where &s;hall we ever find another?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed, yet gratified, could not &s;peak, for the &s;peed with which they ran almo&s;t took away her breath; and be|fore they were near home, &s;lackening her
<PB N="269" REF="268">
pace, and panting, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her &s;trength was exhau&s;ted, and that &s;he could go &s;o fa&s;t no further.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let us then &s;top and re&s;t,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"but why will you not lean upon me? &s;urely this is no time for &s;cruples, and for idle and unnece&s;&s;ary &s;cruples, Mi&s;s Beverley can never find a time."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, urged equally by &s;hame at his &s;peech and by weakne&s;s from fatigue, leant upon his arm; but &s;he &s;oon repented her conde&s;cen&s;ion; for Delvile, with an emotion he &s;eemed to find wholly irrepre&s;&s;i|ble, pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"&s;weet lovely burthen! O why not thus for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>The &s;trength of Cecilia was now in&s;tant|ly re&s;tored, and &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew from his hold; he &s;uffered her to di&s;engage her|&s;elf, but &s;aid in a faultering voice, <Q REND="inline">"par|don me, Cecilia!&mdash;Madam!&mdash;Mi&s;s Bever|ley, I mean!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, without making any an&s;wer, walked on by her&s;elf, as quick a pace as &s;he was able; and Delvile, not venturing to oppo&s;e her, &s;ilently followed.</P>
<P>They had gone but a few &s;teps, before there came a violent &s;hower of hail; and the wind, which was very high, being im|mediately in their faces, Cecilia was &s;o pel|ted and incommoded, that &s;he was fre|quently
<PB N="270" REF="269">
obliged to &s;top, in defiance of her utmo&s;t efforts to force her&s;elf forward. Delvile then approaching her, propo&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould again &s;tand under a tree, as the hunder and lightening for the pre&s;ent &s;eemed over, and wait there till the fury of the hail was pa&s;t: and Cecilia, though never before &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to oblige him, was &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the violence of the wind and hail, that &s;he was forced to comply.</P>
<P>Every in&s;tant now &s;eemed an age; yet neither hail nor wind abated: mean time they were both &s;ilent, and both, though with different feelings, equally comfortle&s;s.</P>
<P>Delvile, however, who took care to place him&s;elf on the &s;ide whence the wind blew harde&s;t, perceived, in &s;pite of his endea|vours to &s;ave her, &s;ome hail-&s;tones lodged upon her thin &s;ummer cloak: he then took off his own hat, and, though he ventured not to let it touch her, held it in &s;uch a manner as to &s;helter her better.</P>
<P>Cecilia now could no longer be either &s;ilent or unmoved, but turning to him with much emotion, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why will you do this, Mr. Delvile?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What would I <HI>not</HI> do,</Q> "an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to obtain forgivene&s;s from Mi&s;s Bever|ley?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="270">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well,&mdash;pray put on your hat."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you command it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, certainly!&mdash;but I wi&s;h it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> cried he, in&s;tantly putting it on, <Q REND="inline">"who&s;e are the commands that would have half the weight with your wi&s;hes?"</Q></P>
<P>And then, after another pau&s;e, he added, <Q REND="inline">"do you forgive me?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, a&s;hamed of the cau&s;e of their di&s;&s;ention, and &s;oftened by the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his manner, an&s;wered very readily, <Q REND="inline">"yes, yes,&mdash;why will you make me remember &s;uch non&s;en&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All &s;weetne&s;s,</Q> "cried he warmly, and &s;natching her hand, <Q REND="inline">"is Mi&s;s Beverley!&mdash;O that I had power&mdash;that it were not ut|terly impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;that the cruelty of my &s;ituation&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I find,"</Q> cried &s;he, greatly agitated, and forcibly drawing away her hand, <Q REND="inline">"you will teach me, for another time, the folly of fearing bad weather!"</Q></P>
<P>And &s;he hurried from beneath the tree; and Delvile perceiving one of the &s;ervants approach with an Umbrella, went forward to take it from him, and directed him to ha&s;ten in&s;tantly to Lady Honoria.</P>
<P>Then returning to Cecilia, he would have held it over her head, but with an air of di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he took it into her own hand.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="271">
<Q REND="inline">"Will you not let me carry it for you?"</Q> he cried.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, there is not any occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>They then proceeded &s;ilently on.</P>
<P>The &s;torm was now &s;oon over; but it grew very dark, and as they had quitted the path while they ran, in order to get home by a &s;norter cut, the walk was &s;o bad from the height of the gra&s;s, and the unevenne&s;s of the ground, that Cecilia had the utmo&s;t difficulty to make her way; yet &s;he re&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Delvile, who walked anxiou&s;ly by her &s;ide, and &s;eemed equally fearful upon his own ac|count and upon hers, to tru&s;t him&s;elf with being importunate.</P>
<P>At length they came to a place which Cecilia in vain tried to pa&s;s; Delvile then grew more urgent to help her; firm, how|ever, in declining all aid, &s;he preferred going a con&s;iderable way round to another part of the park which led to the hou&s;e. Delvile, angry as well as mortified, pro|po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her no more, but followed without &s;aying a word.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he felt not all the re&s;ent|ment &s;he di&s;played, &s;till thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it, as &s;he was much provoked with the perpetual incon&s;i&s;tency of his be|haviour, and deemed it wholly improper to &s;uffer, without di&s;couragement, occa&s;ional
<PB N="273" REF="272">
&s;allies of tenderne&s;s from one who, in his general conduct, behaved with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous re&s;erve.</P>
<P>They now arrived at the ca&s;tle; but en|tering by a back way, came to a &s;mall and narrow pa&s;&s;age which ob&s;tructed the en|trance of the umbrella: Delvile once more, and almo&s;t involuntarily, offered to help her; but, letting down the &s;pring, &s;he cold|ly &s;aid &s;he had no further u&s;e for it.</P>
<P>He then went forward to open a &s;mall gate which led by another long pa&s;&s;age into the hall: but hearing the &s;ervants advance, he held it for an in&s;tant in his hand, while, in a tone of voice the mo&s;t dejected, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I am grieved to find you thus offended; but were it po&s;&s;ible you could know half the wretchedne&s;s of my heart, the genero&s;ity of your own would make you regret this &s;everity!"</Q> and then, opening the gate, he bowed, and went another way.</P>
<P>Cecilia was now in the mid&s;t of &s;ervants; but &s;o much &s;hocked and a&s;toni&s;hed by the unexpected &s;peech of Delvile, which in|&s;tantly changed all her anger into &s;orrow, that &s;he &s;carce knew what they &s;aid to her, nor what &s;he replied; though they all with one voice enquired what was become of Lady Honoria, and which way they &s;hould run to &s;eek her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile then came al&s;o, and &s;he was obliged to recollect her&s;elf. She im|mediately
<PB N="274" REF="273">
propo&s;ed her going to bed, and drinking white wine whey to prevent taking cold: cold, indeed, &s;he feared not; yet &s;he agreed to the propo&s;al, for &s;he was con|founded and di&s;mayed by what had pa&s;&s;ed, and utterly unable to hold any conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>Her perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s were, how|ever, all attributed to fatigue and fright; and Mrs. Delvile, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in hurry|ing her to bed, went to perform the &s;ame office for Lady Honoria, who arrived at that time.</P>
<P>Left at length by her&s;elf, &s;he revolved in her mind the adventure of the evening, and the whole behaviour of Delvile &s;ince fir&s;t &s;he was acquainted with him. That he loved her with tenderne&s;s, with fond|ne&s;s loved her, &s;eemed no longer to admit of any doubt, for however di&s;tant and cold he appeared, when acting with circum|&s;pection and de&s;ign, the moment he was off his guard from &s;urpri&s;e, terror, accident of any &s;ort, the moment that he was be|trayed into acting from nature and incli|nation, he was con&s;tantly certain to di&s;|cover a regard the mo&s;t animated and flattering.</P>
<P>This regard, however, was not more evi|dent than his de&s;ire to conceal and to con|quer it: he &s;eemed to dread even her &s;ight,
<PB N="275" REF="274">
and to have impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf the mo&s;t rigid forbearance of all conver&s;ation or in|tercour&s;e with her.</P>
<P>Whence could this ari&s;e? what &s;trange and unfathomable cau&s;e could render nece&s;&s;ary a conduct &s;o my&s;terious? he knew not, in|deed, that &s;he her&s;elf wi&s;hed it changed, but he could not be ignorant that his chance with almo&s;t any woman would at lea&s;t be worth trying.</P>
<P>Was the ob&s;tacle which thus di&s;couraged him the condition impo&s;ed by her uncle's will of giving her own name to the man &s;he married? this &s;he her&s;elf thought was an unplea&s;ant circum&s;tance, but yet &s;o common for an heire&s;s, that it could hard|ly out-weigh the many advantages of &s;uch a connection.</P>
<P>Henrietta again occurred to her; the let|ter &s;he had &s;een in her hands was &s;till un|explained: yet her entire conviction that Henrietta was not loved by him, joined to a certainty that affection alone could ever make him think of her, le&s;&s;ened upon this &s;ubject her &s;u&s;picions every moment.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia Pemberton, at la&s;t, re&s;t|ed mo&s;t upon her mind, and &s;he thought it probable &s;ome actual treaty was negociating with the Duke of Derwent.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe was her friend, though &s;he was
<PB N="276" REF="275">
&s;crupulou&s;ly delicate in avoiding either rail|lery or ob&s;ervation upon the &s;ubject of her &s;on, whom &s;he rarely mentioned, and never but upon occa&s;ions in which Cecilia could have no po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Father, therefore, notwith&s;tanding all Mr. Monckton had repre&s;ented to the contrary, appeared to be the real ob&s;tacle; his pride might readily object to her birth, which though not contemptible, was mere|ly decent, and which, if traced beyond her grandfather, lo&s;t all title even to that epithet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If this, however,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"is at la&s;t his &s;ituation, how much have I been to blame in cen&s;uring his conduct! for while to me he has appeared capricious, he has, in fact, acted wholly from nece&s;&s;ity: if his father in&s;i&s;ts upon his forming another connection, has he not been honourable, prudent and ju&s;t, in flying an object that made him think of di&s;obedience, and endeavouring to keep her ignorant of a partiality it is his duty to curb?</Q></P>
<P>All, therefore, that remained for her to do or to re&s;olve, was to guard her own &s;ecret with more a&s;&s;iduous care than ever, and &s;ince &s;he found that their union was by him&s;elf thought impo&s;&s;ible, to keep from his knowledge that the regret was not all his own.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A MYSTERY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR two days, in con&s;equence of violent colds caught during the &s;torm, Lady Honoria Pemberton and Cecilia were con|fined to their rooms. Cecilia, glad by &s;oli|tude and reflection to compo&s;e her &s;pirits and &s;ettle her plan of conduct, would wil|lingly have &s;till prolonged her retire|ment, but the abatement of her cold afford|ing her no pretence, &s;he was obliged on the third day to make her appearance.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria, though le&s;s recovered, as &s;he had been more a &s;ufferer, was im|patient of any re&s;traint, and would take no denial to quitting her room at the &s;ame time; at dinner, therefore, all the family met as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, with his accu&s;tomed &s;olem|nity of civility, made various enquiries and congratulations upon their danger and their &s;ecurity, carefully in both, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf fir&s;t to Lady Honoria, and then with more &s;tateline&s;s in his kindne&s;s, to Cecilia.
<PB N="278" REF="277">
His lady, who had frequently vi&s;ited them both, had nothing new to hear.</P>
<P>Delvile did not come in till they were all &s;eated, when, ha&s;tily &s;aying he was glad to &s;ee both the ladies &s;o well again, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tant|ly employed him&s;elf in ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the agitation of a man who feared tru&s;ting him|&s;elf to &s;it idle.</P>
<P>Little, however, as he &s;aid, Cecilia was much &s;truck by the melancholy tone of his voice, and the moment &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, &s;he ob&s;erved that his countenance was equally &s;ad.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure you are not well; I cannot imagine why you will not have &s;ome advice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Were I to &s;end for a phy&s;ician, Sir,"</Q> cried Delvile, with affected chearfulne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"he would find it much more difficult to imagine what advice to give me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Permit me however, Mr. Mortimer,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"to return you my humble thanks for the honour of your a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the thunder &s;torm! I am afraid you made your&s;elf ill by attending <HI>me!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip,"</Q> returned Delvile, colouring very high, yet pretending to laugh; <Q REND="inline">"made &s;o great a coward of me, that I ran away from &s;hame at my own inferiority of courage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Were you, then, with Lady Honoria during the &s;torm?"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="278">
<Q REND="inline">"No, Madam!"</Q> cried Lady Honoria very quick; <Q REND="inline">"but he was &s;o good as to <HI>leave</HI> me during the &s;torm."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is this po&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lady Honoria was &s;uch a Heroine,"</Q> an&s;wered Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he wholly di&s;|dained receiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; her valour was &s;o much more undaunted than mine, that &s;he ventured to brave the lightning un|der an oak tree!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, dear Mrs. Delvile,"</Q> exclaimed Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"think what a &s;impleton he would have made of me! he wanted to per|&s;uade me that in the open air I &s;hould be le&s;s expo&s;ed to danger than under the &s;helter of a thick tree!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lady Honoria,"</Q> replied Mrs. Delvile, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"the next tale of &s;candal you oblige me to hear, I will in&s;i&s;t for your puni&s;hment that you &s;hall read one of Mr. Newbury's little books! there are twenty of them that will explain this mat|ter to you, and &s;uch reading will at lea&s;t employ your time as u&s;efully as &s;uch tales!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know whether you are laughing at me or not, but really I concluded Mr. Mortimer only cho&s;e to amu&s;e him&s;elf in a t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te with Mi&s;s Beverley."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was not with Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cri|ed Mrs. Delvile with quickne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he was
<PB N="280" REF="279">
alone,&mdash;I &s;aw her my&s;elf the moment &s;he came in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, ma'am,&mdash;but not then,&mdash;he was gone;"</Q>&mdash;&s;aid Cecilia, endeavouring, but not very &s;ucce&s;sfully, to &s;peak with com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had the honour,"</Q> cried Delvile, making, with equal &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;ame at|tempt, <Q REND="inline">"to wait upon Mi&s;s Beverley to the little gate; and I was then returning to Lady Honoria when I met her lady&s;hip ju&s;t coming in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very extraordinary, Mortimer,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, &s;taring, <Q REND="inline">"to attend Lady Honoria the la&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't be angry in earne&s;t, Sir,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, gayly, <Q REND="inline">"for I did not mean to turn tell-tale."</Q></P>
<P>Here the &s;ubject was dropt: greatly to the joy both of Delvile and Cecilia, who mutually exerted them&s;elves in talking upon what next was &s;tarted, in order to prevent its being recurred to again.</P>
<P>That fear, however, over, Delvile &s;aid little more; &s;adne&s;s hung heavily on his mind; he was ab&s;ent, di&s;turbed, unea&s;y; yet he endeavoured no longer to avoid Ce|cilia; on the contrary, when &s;he aro&s;e to quit the room, he looked evidently di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>The ladies colds kept them at home all the evening, and Delvile, for the fir&s;t time
<PB N="281" REF="280">
&s;ince their arrival at the ca&s;tle, joined them at tea: nor when it was over, did he as u&s;ual retire; he loitered, pretended to be caught by a new pamphlet, and looked as anxiou&s;ly eager to &s;peak with Cecilia, as he had hitherto appeared to &s;hun her.</P>
<P>With new emotion and fre&s;h di&s;tre&s;s Ce|cilia perceived this change; what he might have to &s;ay &s;he could not conjecture, but all that foreran his communication convinced her it was nothing &s;he could wi&s;h; and much as &s;he had de&s;ired &s;ome explanation of his de&s;igns, when the long-expected mo|ment &s;eemed arriving, progno&s;tications the mo&s;t cruel of the event, repre&s;&s;ed her impa|tience, and deadened her curio&s;ity. She earne&s;tly lamented her unfortunate re&s;i|dence in his hou&s;e, where the adoration of every inhabitant, from his father to the lowe&s;t &s;ervant, had impre&s;&s;ed her with the &s;tronge&s;t belief of his general worthine&s;s, and greatly, though imperceptibly, encrea&s;|ed her regard for him, &s;ince &s;he had now not a doubt remaining but that &s;ome cruel, &s;ome fatal ob&s;tacle, prohibited their union.</P>
<P>To collect fortitude to hear it with compo&s;ure, was now her whole &s;tudy; but though, when alone, &s;he thought any di&s;covery preferable to &s;u&s;pence, all her courage failed her when Delvile appeared, and if &s;he could not detain Lady Honoria, &s;he ivoluntarily followed her.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="281">
Thus pa&s;&s;ed four or five days; during which the health of Delvile &s;eemed to &s;uf|fer with his mind, and though he refu&s;ed to acknowledge he was ill, it was evident to every body that he was far from well.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile frequently urged him to con&s;ent to have &s;ome advice; but he al|ways revived, though with forced and tran|&s;itory &s;pirits, at the mention of a phy&s;ician, and the propo&s;al ended in nothing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, too, at length grew alarm|ed; her enquiries were more penetrating and pointed, but they were not more &s;uc|ce&s;sful; every attack of this &s;ort was fol|lowed by immediate gaiety, which, however con&s;trained, &s;erved, for the time, to change the &s;ubject. Mrs. Delvile, however, was not &s;oon to be deceived; &s;he watched her &s;on ince&s;&s;antly, and &s;eemed to feel an in|quietude &s;carce le&s;s than his own.</P>
<P>Cecilia's di&s;tre&s;s was now augmented every moment, and the difficulty to conceal it grew every hour more painful; &s;he felt her&s;elf the cau&s;e of the dejection of the &s;on, and that thought made her feel guilty in the pre&s;ence of the mother; the explanation &s;he expected threatened her with new mi&s;ery, and the courage to endure it &s;he tried in vain to acquire; her heart was mo&s;t cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed, apprehen&s;ion and &s;u&s;pence never left it for an in&s;tant; re&s;t abandoned her at night, and chearfulne&s;s by day.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="282">
At this time the two lords, Ernolf and Derford, arrived; and Cecilia, who at fir&s;t had lamented their de&s;ign, now rejoiced in their pre&s;ence, &s;ince they divided the atten|tion of Mrs. Delvile, which &s;he began to fear was not wholly directed to her &s;on, and &s;ince they &s;aved her from having the whole force of Lady Honoria's high &s;pirits and gay rattle to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Their immediate ob&s;ervations upon the ill looks of Delvile, &s;tartled both Cecilia and the mother even more than their own fears, which they had hoped were rather the re&s;ult of apprehen&s;ion than of rea&s;on. Cecilia now &s;everely reproached her&s;elf with having deferred the conference he was evi|dently &s;eeking, not doubting but &s;he had contributed to his indi&s;po&s;ition by denying him the relief he might expect from con|cluding the affair.</P>
<P>Melancholy as was this idea, it was yet a motive to overpower her reluctance, and determine her no longer to &s;hun what it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to endure.</P>
<P>Deep rea&s;oners, however, when they are al&s;o nice ca&s;ui&s;ts, frequently re&s;olve with a tardine&s;s which renders their re&s;olutions of no effect: this was the ca&s;e with Cecilia; the &s;ame morning that &s;he came down &s;tairs prepared to meet with firmne&s;s the blow which &s;he believed awaited her, Delvile,
<PB N="284" REF="283">
who, &s;ince the arrival of the two lords, had always appeared at the general breakfa&s;t, acknowledged in an&s;wer to his mother's earne&s;t enquiries, that he had a cold and head-ache: and had he, at the &s;ame time, acknowledged a pleuri&s;y and fever, the alarm in&s;tantly &s;pread in the family could not have been greater; Mr. Delvile, furi|ou&s;ly ringing the bell, ordered a man and hor&s;e to go that moment to Dr. Ly&s;ter, the phy&s;ician to the family, and not to return without him if he was him&s;elf alive; and Mrs. Delvile, not le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, though more quiet, fixed her eyes upon her &s;on, with an expre&s;&s;ion of anxiety that &s;hewed her whole happine&s;s was bound in his recovery.</P>
<P>Delvile endeavoured to laugh away their fears, a&s;&s;uring them he &s;hould be well the next day, and repre&s;enting in ridiculous terms the perplexity of Dr. Ly&s;ter to con|trive &s;ome pre&s;cription for him.</P>
<P>Cecilia's behaviour, guided by prudence and mode&s;ty, was &s;teady and compo&s;ed; &s;he believed his illne&s;s and his unea&s;ine&s;s were the &s;ame, and &s;he hoped the re&s;olution &s;he had taken would bring relief to them both: while the terrors of Mr. and Mrs. Delvile &s;eemed &s;o greatly beyond the occa|&s;ion, that her own were rather le&s;&s;ened than encrea&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>Dr. Ly&s;ter &s;oon arrived; he was a hu|mane
<PB N="285" REF="284">
and excellent phy&s;ician, and a man of &s;ound judgment.</P>
<P>Delvile, gayly &s;haking hands with him, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Dr. Ly&s;ter, you little ex|pected to meet a patient, who, were he as &s;kilful, would be as able to do bu&s;ine&s;s as your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, with &s;uch a hand as this?"</Q> cried the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"come, come, you mu&s;t not teach me my own profe&s;&s;ion. When I attend a patient, I come to tell how he is my&s;elf, not to be told."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is, then ill!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"oh Mortimer, why have you thus deceived us!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is his di&s;order?"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"let us call in more help; who &s;hall we &s;end for, doctor?"</Q></P>
<P>And again he rang the bell.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What now?"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, coolly; <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t a man be dying if he is not in per|fect health? we want nobody el&s;e; I hope I can pre&s;cribe for a cold without demand|ing a con&s;ultation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But are you &s;ure it is merely a cold?"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"may not &s;ome dreadful malady&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, have patience,"</Q> interrupted the doctor; <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Mortimer and I will have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e together pre&s;ently; mean|time, let us all &s;it down, and behave like
<PB N="286" REF="285">
Chri&s;tians: I never talk of my art before company. 'Tis hard you won't let me be a gentleman at large for two minutes!"</Q></P>
<P>Lady Honoria and Cecilia would then have ri&s;en, but neither Dr. Ly&s;ter nor Del|vile would permit them to go; and a con|ver&s;ation tolerably lively took place, after which, the party in general &s;eparating, the doctor accompanied Delvile to his own apartment.</P>
<P>Cecilia then went up &s;tairs, where &s;he mo&s;t impatiently waited &s;ome intelligence: none, however, arriving, in about half an hour &s;he returned to the parlour; &s;he found it empty, but was &s;oon joined by Lady Honoria and Lord Ernolf.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria, happy in having &s;ome|thing going forward, and not much con|cerning her&s;elf whether it were good or evil, was as eager to communicate what &s;he had gathered, as Cecilia was to hear it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o I don't find at la&s;t but that all this prodigious ill|ne&s;s will be laid to your account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To my account?"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how is that po&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why this tender chicken caught cold in the &s;torm la&s;t week, and not being put to bed by its mama, and nur&s;ed with white-wine whey, the poor thing has got a fever."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286">
<Q REND="inline">"He is a fine young man,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Ernolf; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be &s;orry any harm hap|pened to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He <HI>was</HI> a fine young man, my Lord,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"but he is grown in|tolerably &s;tupid lately; however, it's all the fault of his father and mother. Was ever any thing half &s;o ridiculous as their beha|viour this morning? it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I forbore laughing in their faces: and really, I believe if I was to meet with &s;uch an unfortunate accident with Mr. Del|vile, it would turn him to marble at once! indeed he is little better now, but &s;uch an affront as that would never let him move from the &s;pot where he received it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I forgive him, however,"</Q> returned Lord Ernolf, <Q REND="inline">"for his anxiety about his &s;on, &s;ince he is the la&s;t of &s;o ancient a fa|mily."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is his great misfortune, my lord,"</Q> an&s;wered Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e it is the very rea&s;on they make &s;uch a puppet of him. If there were but a few more little ma&s;ters to dandle and fondle, I'll an&s;wer for it this precious Mortimer would &s;oon be left to him&s;elf: and then, really, I believe he would be a good tolerable &s;ort of young man. Don't you think he would, Mi&s;s Beverley?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="287">
<Q REND="inline">"O yes!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I believe&mdash;I think &s;o!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, nay, I did not a&s;k if you thought him tolerable <HI>now,</HI> &s;o no need to be fright|ened."</Q></P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by the en|trance of Dr. Ly&s;ter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"and when am I to go into mourning for my cou|&s;in Mortimer?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why very &s;oon,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"un|le&s;s you take better care of him. He has confe&s;&s;ed to me that after being out in the &s;torm la&s;t Wedne&s;day, he &s;at in his wet cloaths all the evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"and what would that do to him? I have no no|tion of a man's always wanting a cambric handkerchief about his throat."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps your lady&s;hip had rather make him apply it to his eyes?"</Q> cried the doc|tor: <Q REND="inline">"however, &s;itting inactive in wet cloaths would de&s;troy a &s;touter man than Mr. Delvile; but he <HI>forgot</HI> it, he &s;ays! which of you two young ladies could not have given as good rea&s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your mo&s;t obedient,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Hono|ria; <Q REND="inline">"and why &s;hould not a lady give as good a rea&s;on as a gentleman?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know,"</Q> an&s;wered he, drily, <Q REND="inline">"but from want of practice, I believe."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="288">
<Q REND="inline">"O wor&s;e and wor&s;e!"</Q> cried Lady Ho|noria;" <Q REND="inline">you &s;hall never be my phy&s;ician; if I was to be attended by you, you'd make me &s;ick in&s;tead of well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the better,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"for then I mu&s;t have the honour of attending you till I made you well in&s;tead of &s;ick."</Q> And with a good-humoured &s;mile, he left them; and Lord Derford, at the &s;ame time, coming into the room, Cecilia contrived to &s;troll out into the park.</P>
<P>The account to which &s;he had been li&s;|tening redoubled her unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he was con&s;cious that whatever was the indi&s;po&s;i|tion of Delvile, and whether it was mental or bodily, &s;he was her&s;elf its occa&s;ion: through her he had been negligent, &s;he had rendered him forgetful, and in con&s;ulting her own fears in preference to his peace, &s;he had avoided an explanation, though he had vigilantly &s;ought one. <HI>She knew not,</HI> he told her <HI>half the wretchedne&s;s of his heart.</HI>&mdash;Alas! thought &s;he, he little conjectures the &s;tate of mine!</P>
<P>Lady Honoria &s;uffered her not to be long alone; in about half an hour &s;he ran after her, gayly calling out, <Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Be|verley, you have lo&s;t the delightfulle&s;t di|ver&s;ion in the world! I have ju&s;t had the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;cene with my Lord Der|ford that you ever heard in your life! I

a&s;ked him what put it in his head to be in love with you,&mdash;and he had the &s;implicity to an&s;wer, quite &s;eriou&s;ly, his father!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was very right,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"if the de&s;ire of uniting two e&s;tates is to be deno|minated being in love; for that, mo&s;t cer|tainly, was put into his head by his father."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but you have not heard half. I told him, then, that, as a friend, in confi|dence I mu&s;t acquaint him, I believed you intended to marry Mortimer&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, Lady Honoria!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you &s;hall hear the rea&s;on; becau&s;e, as I a&s;&s;ured him, it was proper he &s;hould immediately call him to account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you mad, Lady Honoria?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For you know,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Be|verley has had one duel fought for her al|ready, and a lady who has once had that compliment paid her, always expects it from every new admirer; and I really believe your not ob&s;erving that form is the true cau&s;e of her coldne&s;s to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible you can have talked &s;o wildly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, and what is much better, he be|lieved every word I &s;aid!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Much better?&mdash;No, indeed, it is much wor&s;e! and if, in fact, he is &s;o uncom|monly weak, I &s;hall really be but little in|debted to your lady&s;hip for giving him &s;uch notions."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="290">
<Q REND="inline">"O I would not but have done it for the world! for I never laughed &s;o immode|rately in my life. He began a&s;&s;uring me he was not afraid, for he &s;aid he had prac|ti&s;ed fencing more than any thing: &s;o I made him promi&s;e to &s;end a challenge to Mortimer as &s;oon as he is well enough to come down again: for Dr. Ly&s;ter has or|dered him to keep his room."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;mothering her concern for this la&s;t piece of intelligence by pretending to feel it merely for the former, expo&s;tu|lated with Lady Honoria upon &s;o mi&s;|chievous a frolic, and earne&s;tly entreated her to go back and contradict it all.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, not for the world!"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"he has not the lea&s;t &s;pirit, and I dare &s;ay he would not fight to &s;ave the whole nation from de&s;truction; but I'll make him be|lieve that it's nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give him &s;omething to think of, for really his poor head is &s;o vacant, that I am &s;ure if one might but play upon it with &s;ticks, it would &s;ound ju&s;t like a drum."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, finding it vain to combat with her fanta&s;ies, was at length obliged to &s;ub|mit.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the day &s;he pa&s;&s;ed very un|plea&s;antly; Delvile appeared not; his fa|ther was re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;turbed, and his mo|ther, though attentive to her gue&s;ts, and,
<PB N="292" REF="291">
for their &s;akes rallying her &s;pirits, was vi|&s;ibly ill di&s;po&s;ed to think or to talk but of her &s;on.</P>
<P>One diver&s;ion, however, Cecilia found for her&s;elf; Delvile had a favourite &s;paniel, which, when he walked followed him, and when he rode, ran by his hor&s;e; this dog, who was not admitted into the hou&s;e, &s;he now took under her own care; and &s;pent almo&s;t the whole day out of doors, chiefly for the &s;atisfaction of making him her com|panion.</P>
<P>The next morning, when Dr. Ly&s;ter came again, &s;he kept in the way, in order to hear his opinion; and was &s;itting with Lady Honoria in the parlour, when he entered it to write a pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, in a few moments, follow|ed him, and with a face and voice of the ten|dere&s;t maternal apprehen&s;ions, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Doc|tor, one thing entru&s;t me with immediately; I can neither bear impo&s;ition nor &s;u&s;pence;&mdash;you know what I would &s;ay!&mdash;tell me if I have any thing to fear, that my prepa|rations may be adequate!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, I believe, in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You believe!"</Q> repeated Mrs. Delvile, &s;tarting; <Q REND="inline">"Oh doctor!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you would not have me &s;ay I am <HI>certain,</HI> would you? the&s;e are no times for Popery and infallibility; however, I a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="293" REF="292">
you I think him perfectly &s;afe. He has done a fooli&s;h and idle trick, but no man is wi&s;e always. We mu&s;t get rid of his fever, and then if his cold remains, with any cough, he may make a little excur&s;ion to Bri&s;tol."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Bri&s;tol! nay then,&mdash;I under&s;tand you too well!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, you don't under&s;tand me at all; I don't &s;end him to Bri&s;tol becau&s;e he is in a bad way, but merely becau&s;e I mean to put him in a good one.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let him, then, go immediately; why &s;hould he encrea&s;e the danger by waiting a moment? I will order&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold, hold! I know what to order my&s;elf! 'Tis a &s;trange thing people will always teach me my own duty! why &s;hould I make a man travel &s;uch weather as this in a fever? do you think I want to confine him in a mad-hou&s;e, or be confined in one my|&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly you know be&s;t&mdash;but &s;till if there is any danger&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, there is not! only we don't chu&s;e there &s;hould be any. And how will he entertain him&s;elf better than by going to Bri&s;tol? I &s;end him merely on a jaunt of plea&s;ure; and I am &s;ure he will be &s;afer there than &s;hut up in a hou&s;e with two &s;uch young ladies as the&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="293">
And then he made off. Mrs. Delvile, too anxious for conver&s;ation, left the room, and Cecilia, too con&s;cious for &s;ilence, forc|ed her&s;elf into di&s;cour&s;e with Lady Ho|noria.</P>
<P>Three days &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in this uncertainty what &s;he had to expect; blaming tho&s;e fears which had deferred an explanation, and tor|mented by Lady Honoria, who&s;e raillery and levity now grew very un&s;ea&s;onable. Fidel, the favourite &s;paniel, was almo&s;t her only con&s;olation, and &s;he plea&s;ed her&s;elf not incon&s;iderably by making a friend of the faithful animal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. AN ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fourth day the hou&s;e wore a better a&s;pect; Delvile's fever was gone, and Dr. Ly&s;ter permitted him to leave his room: a cough, however, remained, and his journey to Bri&s;tol was &s;ettled to take place in three days. Cecilia, knowing he was now expected down &s;tairs, ha&s;tened out of the parlour the moment &s;he had fini&s;hed her breakfa&s;t; for affected by his illne&s;s, and hurt at the approaching &s;eparation, &s;he dreaded the fir&s;t meeting, and wi&s;hed to fortify her mind for bearing it with pro|priety.</P>
<P>In a very few minutes, Lady Honoria, running after her, entreated that &s;he would come down; <Q REND="inline">"for Mortimer,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"is in the parlour, and the poor child is made &s;o much of by its papa and mama, that I wi&s;h they don't half kill him by their ridiculous fondne&s;s. It is amazing to me he is &s;o pa|tient with them, for if they teized me half as much, I &s;hould be ready to jump up and &s;hake them. But I wi&s;h you would come down, for I a&s;&s;ure you it's a comical &s;cene."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="295">
<Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip is &s;oon diverted! but what is there &s;o comical in the anxiety of parents for an only &s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, they don't care a &s;traw for him all the time! it's merely that he may live to keep up this old ca&s;tle, which I hope in my heart he will pull down the moment they are dead! But do pray come; it will really give you &s;pirits to &s;ee them all. The fa|ther keeps ringing the bell to order half a hundred pair of boots for him, and all the great coats in the county; and the mother &s;its and looks as if a hear&s;e and mourning coach were already coming over the draw|bridge: but the mo&s;t diverting object among them is my Lord Derford! O, it is really too entertaining to &s;ee him! there he &s;its, thinking the whole time of his chal|lenge! I intend to employ him all this af|ternoon in practi&s;ing to &s;hoot at a mark."</Q></P>
<P>And then again &s;he pre&s;&s;ed her to join the group, and Cecilia, fearing her oppo&s;ition might &s;eem &s;trange, con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Delvile aro&s;e at her entrance, and, with tolerable &s;teadine&s;s &s;he congratulated him on his recovery: and then, taking her u&s;ual &s;eat, employed her&s;elf in embroidering a &s;creen. She joined too, occa&s;ionally, in the conver&s;ation, and ob&s;erved, not without &s;urpri&s;e, that Delvile &s;eemed much le&s;s dejected than before his confinement.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="296">
Soon after, he ordered his hor&s;e, and, ac|companied by Lord Derford, rode out. Mr. Delvile then took Lord Ernolf to &s;hew him &s;ome intended improvements in another part of the ca&s;tle, and Lady Honoria walk|ed away in &s;earch of any entertainment &s;he could find.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, in better &s;pirits than &s;he had been for many days, &s;ent for her own work, and &s;itting by Cecilia, conver&s;ed with her again as in former times; mixing in|&s;truction with entertainment, and general &s;atire with particular kindne&s;s, in a manner at once &s;o lively and &s;o flattering, that Ce|cilia her&s;elf reviving, found but little diffi|culty in bearing her part in the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And thus, with &s;ome gaiety, and toler|able ea&s;e, was &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the morning; but ju&s;t as they were talking of changing their dre&s;s for dinner, Lady Ho|noria with an air of the utmo&s;t exultation, came flying into the room. <Q REND="inline">"Well, ma'am,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ome news now that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> tell you, becau&s;e it will make you be|lieve me another time: though I know it will put you in a pa&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's &s;weetly de&s;igned, at lea&s;t!"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, laughing; <Q REND="inline">"however, I'll tru&s;t you, for my pa&s;&s;ions will not, ju&s;t now, be irritated by &s;traws."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="297">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, don't you remember I told you when you were in town that Mr. Mortimer kept a mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, di&s;dain|fully," <Q REND="inline">and you may remember, Lady Ho|noria, I told you&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you would not believe a word of it! but it's all true, I a&s;&s;ure you! and now he has brought her down here; he &s;ent for her about three weeks ago, and he has boarded her at a cottage, about half a mile from the Park-gate."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, to whom Henrietta Belfield was in&s;tantly pre&s;ent, changed colour repeatedly, and turned &s;o extremely &s;ick, &s;he could with difficulty keep her &s;eat. She forced her&s;elf, however, to continue her work, though &s;he knew &s;o little what &s;he was about, that &s;he put her needle in and out of the &s;ame place without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Mean-while Mrs. Delvile, with a coun|tenance of the utmo&s;t indignation, exclaim|ed <Q REND="inline">"Lady Honoria, if you think a tale of &s;candal &s;uch as this reflects no di&s;grace upon its relater, you mu&s;t pardon me for en|treating you to find an auditor more of the &s;ame opinion than my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, ma'am, &s;ince you are &s;o angry, I'll tell you the whole affair, for this is but half of it. He has a child here, too,&mdash;I
<PB N="299" REF="298">
vow I long to &s;ee it!&mdash;and he is &s;o fond of it that he &s;pends half his time in nur&s;ing it;&mdash;and that, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the thing that takes him out &s;o much; and I fancy, too, that's what has made him grow &s;o grave, for may be he thinks it would not be pretty to be very fri&s;ky, now he's a papa."</Q></P>
<P>Not only Cecilia, but Mrs. Delvile her|&s;elf was now overpowered, and &s;he &s;at for &s;ome time wholly &s;ilent and confounded; Lady Honoria then, turning to Cecilia ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s me, Mi&s;s Beverley, what are you about! why that flower is the mo&s;t ridiculous thing I ever &s;aw! you have &s;poilt your whole work."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, though pretending to laugh, then began to unpick it; and Mrs. Delvile, recovering, more calmly, though not le&s;s angrily, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"And has this tale the honour of being invented &s;olely by your lady&s;hip, or had it any other a&s;&s;i&s;tant?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, I a&s;&s;ure you, it's no invention of mine; I had it from very good autho|rity upon my word. But only look at Mi&s;s Beverley! would not one think I had &s;aid that &s;he had a child her&s;elf? She looks as pale as death. My dear, I am &s;ure you can't be well?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</Q> cried Cecilia, forcing a &s;mile, though ex remely provok|ed with her; <Q REND="inline">"I never was better."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="299">
And then, with the hope of appearing unconcerned, &s;he rai&s;ed her head; but meeting the eyes of Mrs. Delvile fixed upon her face with a look of penetrating ob&s;ervation, aba&s;hed and guilty, &s;he again dropt it, and re&s;umed her work."</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure there is no occa&s;ion to &s;end for Dr. Ly&s;ter to <HI>you,</HI> for you recover your&s;elf in a moment: you have the fine&s;t colour now I ever &s;aw: has not &s;he, Mrs. Delvile? did you ever &s;ee any body blu&s;h &s;o becomingly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h, Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, with &s;everity, <Q REND="inline">"it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee <HI>you</HI> blu&s;h!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but I never do! not but what it's pretty enough too; but I don't know how it is, it never happens. Now Euphra&s;ia can blu&s;h from morning to night. I can't think how &s;he contrives it. Mi&s;s Beverley, too, plays at it va&s;tly well; &s;he's red and white, and white and red half a dozen times in a minute. E&s;pecially looking at her archly, and lowering her voice, "if you talk to her of Mortimer!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed! no &s;uch thing!"</Q> cried Cecilia with &s;ome re&s;entment, and again looking up; but glancing her eyes towards Mrs. Delvile, and again meeting hers, filled with the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of enquiring
<PB N="301" REF="300">
&s;olicitude, unable to &s;u&s;tain their inqui&s;ition, and &s;hocked to find her&s;elf thus watchfully ob&s;erved, &s;he returned in ha&s;ty confu&s;ion to her employment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, again, <Q REND="inline">"but what are you about now? do you intend to unpick the whole &s;creen?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How can &s;he tell what &s;he is doing,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"if you torment her thus ince&s;&s;antly? I will take you away from her, that &s;he may have a little peace. You &s;hall do me the honour to attend my toilette, and acquaint me with &s;ome further particulars of this extraordi|nary di&s;covery."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile then left the room, but Lady Honoria, before &s;he followed her, &s;aid in a low voice <Q REND="inline">"Pity me, Mi&s;s Bever|ley, if you have the lea&s;t good-nature! I am now going to hear a lecture of two hours long!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, left to her&s;elf, was in a pertur|bation almo&s;t in&s;upportable: Delvile's my|&s;terious conduct &s;eemed the re&s;ult of &s;ome entanglement of vice; Henrietta Belfield, the artle&s;s Henrietta Belfield, &s;he feared had been abu&s;ed, and her own ill-fated partia|lity, which now more than ever &s;he wi&s;hed unknown even to her&s;elf, was evidently be|trayed where mo&s;t the dignity of her mind made her de&s;ire it to be concealed!</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="301">
In this &s;tate of &s;hame, regret and re&s;ent|ment, which made her forget to change her dre&s;s, or her place, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;ur|pri&s;ed by Delvile.</P>
<P>Starting and colouring, &s;he bu&s;ied her|&s;elf with collecting her work, that &s;he might hurry out of the room. Delvile, though &s;ilent him&s;elf, endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; but when &s;he would have gone, he at|tempted to &s;top her, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Bever|ley, for three minutes only."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, indignantly, <Q REND="inline">"not for an in&s;tant!"</Q> and leaving him utterly a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;he ha&s;tened to her own apart|ment.</P>
<P>She was then &s;orry &s;he had been &s;o pre|cipitate; nothing had been clearly proved again&s;t him; no authority was &s;o likely to be fallacious as that of Lady Honoria; nei|ther was he under any engagement to her|&s;elf that could give her any right to mani|fe&s;t &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure. The&s;e reflections, however, came too late, and the quick feel|ings of her agitated mind were too rapid to wait the dictates of cool rea&s;on.</P>
<P>At dinner &s;he attended wholly to Lord Ernolf, who&s;e a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">uous politene&s;s, profit|ting by the humour, &s;aved her the painful effort of forcing conver&s;ation, or the guilty con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of giving way to &s;ilence, and
<PB N="303" REF="302">
enabled her to pre&s;erve her general tenor between taciturnity and loquaciou&s;ne&s;s. Mrs. Delvile &s;he did not once dare look at; but her &s;on, &s;he &s;aw, &s;eemed greatly hurt; yet it was proudly, not &s;orrowfully, and therefore &s;he &s;aw it with le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>During the re&s;t of the day, which was pa&s;&s;ed in general &s;ociety, Mrs. Delvile, though much occupied, frequently leaving the room, and &s;ending for Lady Honoria, was more &s;oft, kind and gentle with Cecilia than ever, looking at her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, often taking her hand, and &s;peaking to her with even unu&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s. Cecilia with mingled &s;adne&s;s and plea&s;ure ob&s;erved this encrea&s;ing regard, which &s;he could not but attribute to the di&s;covery made through Lady Honoria's mi&s;chievous intelligence, and which, while it rejoiced her with the belief of her approbation, added fre&s;h force to her regret in con&s;idering it was fruitle&s;s. Delvile, mean-time, evident|ly offended him&s;elf, conver&s;ed only with the gentlemen, and went very early into his own room.</P>
<P>When they were all retiring, Mrs. Del|vile, following Cecilia, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her maid to talk with her alone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not, I hope, often,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;olicitous or importunate to &s;peak about my &s;on: his character, I believe, wants no
<PB N="304" REF="303">
vindication; clear and un&s;ullied, it has al|ways been its own &s;upport: yet the a&s;per|&s;ion ca&s;t upon it this morning by Lady Ho|noria, I think my&s;elf bound to explain, not partially as his mother, but &s;imply as his friend."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who knew not whither &s;uch an explanation might lead, nor wherefore it was made, heard this opening with much emotion, but gave neither to that nor to what followed any interruption.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile then continued: &s;he had taken the trouble, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ift the whole affair, in order to &s;hame Lady Honoria by a pointed conviction of what &s;he had invent|ed, and to trace from the foundation the circum&s;tances whence her &s;urmi&s;es or re|port had &s;prung.</P>
<P>Delvile, it &s;eems, about a fortnight be|fore the pre&s;ent time, in one of his morn|ing walks, had ob&s;erved a gip&s;ey &s;itting by the &s;ide of the high road, who &s;eemed ex|tremely ill, and who had a very beautiful child tied to her back.</P>
<P>Struck with the baby, he &s;topt to enquire to whom it belonged; to her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, and begged his charity with the mo&s;t piti|able cries of di&s;tre&s;s; telling him that &s;he was travelling to join &s;ome of her fraternity, who were in a body near Bath, but was &s;o ill with an ague and fever that &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould die on the road.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="304">
Delvile de&s;ired her to go to the next cot|tage, and promi&s;ed to pay for her board there till &s;he was better. He then &s;poke to the man and his wife who owned it to take them in, who, glad to oblige his Honour, in&s;tantly con&s;ented, and he had &s;ince called twice to &s;ee in what manner they went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;imple,</Q> continued Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">is a matter of fact in it&s;elf, and how com|plex when embelli&s;hed! This tale has been told by the cottagers to our &s;ervants; it has travelled, probably gaining &s;ome|thing from every mouth, to Lady Hono|ria's maid, and, having reached her lady|&s;hip, was &s;welled in a moment into all we heard! I think, however, that, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, her levity will be rather le&s;s daring. I have not, in this affair, at all &s;pared her; I made her hear from Morti|mer him&s;elf the little &s;tory as it happened; I then carried her to the cottage, where we had the whole matter confirmed; and I af|terwards in&s;i&s;ted upon being told my&s;elf by her maid all &s;he had related to her lady, that &s;he might thus be unan&s;werably convicted of inventing whatever &s;he omitted. I have occa&s;ioned her &s;ome confu&s;ion, and, for the moment, a little re&s;entment; but &s;he is &s;o volatile that neither will la&s;t; and though, with regard to my own family, I may perhaps have rendered her more cau|tious, I fear, with regard to the world in
<PB N="306" REF="305">
general, &s;he is utterly incorrigible, becau&s;e it has neither plea&s;ure nor advantage to offer, that can compen&s;ate for the deprivation of relating one &s;taring &s;tory, or ridiculous anecdote.</Q></P>
<P>And then, wi&s;hing her good night, &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"I make not any apology for this detail, which you owe not, believe me, to a mother's folly, but, if I knew my&s;elf at all, to a love of truth and ju&s;tice. Morti|mer, independent of all connection with me, cannot but to every body appear of a cha|racter which may be deemed even exemp|lary; calumny, therefore, failing upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, injures not only him&s;elf but &s;ociety, &s;ince it weakens all confidence in virtue, and &s;trengthens the &s;ceptici&s;m of depravity."</Q></P>
<P>She then left her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah! thought Cecilia, to me, at lea&s;t, this &s;olicitude for his fame needs no apolo|gy! humane and generous Delvile! never, again, will I a moment doubt your worthi|ne&s;s!"</Q> And then, cheri&s;hing that darling idea, &s;he forgot all her cares and apprehen|&s;ions, her quarrel, her &s;u&s;picions, and the approaching &s;eparation, and, recompen&s;ed for every thing by this refutation of his guilt, &s;he ha&s;tened to bed, and compo&s;ed her&s;elf to re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A CONFERENCE.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY the next morning Cecilia had a vi&s;it from Lady Honoria, who came to tell her &s;tory her own way, and laugh at the anxiety of Mrs. Delvile, and the trouble &s;he had taken; <Q REND="inline">"for, after all, continued &s;he, what did the whole matter &s;ignify? and how could I po&s;&s;ibly help the mi&s;take? when I heard of his paying for a woman's board, what was &s;o natural as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he mu&s;t be his mi&s;tre&s;s? e&s;pecially as there was a child in the ca&s;e. O how I wi&s;h you had been with us! you never &s;aw &s;uch a ridi|culous &s;ight in your life; away we went in the chai&s;e full drive to the cottage, fright|ening all the people almo&s;t into fits; out came the poor woman, away ran the poor man,&mdash;both of them thought the end of the world at hand! The gip&s;ey was be&s;t off, for &s;he went to her old bu&s;ine&s;s, and began begging. I a&s;&s;ure you, I believe &s;he would be very pretty if &s;he was not &s;o ill, and &s;o I dare &s;ay Mortimer thought too, or I fancy he would not have taken &s;uch care of her."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="307">
<Q REND="inline">"Fie; fie, Lady Honoria! will nothing bring conviction to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, you know, there's no harm in that, for why &s;hould not pretty people live as well as ugly ones? There's no occa&s;ion to leave nothing in the world but frights. I looked hard at the baby, to &s;ee if it was like Mortimer, but I could not make it out; tho&s;e young things are like nothing. I tried if it wou d talk, for I wanted &s;ad|ly to make it call Mrs. Delvile grandmama; however, the little urchin could &s;ay nothing to be under&s;tood. O what a rage would Mrs. Delvile have been in! I &s;uppo&s;e this whole ca&s;tle would hardly have been thought heavy enough to cru&s;h &s;uch an in&s;olent brat, though it were to have fallen upon it all at a blow!"</Q></P>
<P>Thus rattled this light-hearted lady till the family was a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t; and then Cecilia, &s;oftened towards Delvile by newly-excited admiration, as well as by the ab&s;ence which would &s;eparate them the following day, intended, by every little cour|teous office in her power, to make her peace with him before his departure: but &s;he ob|&s;erved, with much chagrin, that Mrs. Del|vile never cea&s;ed to watch her, which, ad|ded to an air of pride in the coldne&s;s of Delvile, that he had never before a&s;&s;umed, di&s;couraged her from making the attempt,
<PB N="309" REF="308">
and compelled her to &s;eem quiet and un|concerned.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, the gen|tlemen all rode or walked out; and when the ladies were by them&s;elves, Lady Ho|noria &s;uddenly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Delvile, I can't imagine for what rea&s;on you &s;end Mr. Mortimer to Bri&s;tol."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For a rea&s;on, Lady Honoria, that with all your wildne&s;s, I &s;hould be very &s;orry you &s;hould know better by experience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, ma'am, had we not better make a party, and all go? Mi&s;s Beverley, &s;hould you like to join it? I am afraid it would be va&s;tly di&s;agreeable to you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, now again was <HI>red and white, and whtte and red a dozen times in a minute;</HI> and Mrs. Delvile, ri&s;ing and taking her hand, expre&s;&s;ively &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, you have a thou&s;and times too much &s;en&s;ibility for this mad-cap of a companion. I believe I &s;hall puni&s;h her by taking you away from her all this morning; will you come and &s;it with me in the dre&s;&s;ing room?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia a&s;&s;ented without daring to look at her, and followed in trembling, up &s;tairs. Something of importance, &s;he fancied, would en&s;ue, her &s;ecret &s;he &s;aw was reveal|ed, and therefore &s;he could form no conjec|ture but that Delvile would be the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e: yet whether to explain
<PB N="310" REF="309">
his behaviour, or plead his cau&s;e, whether to expre&s;s her &s;eparate approbation, or communicate &s;ome intelligence from him|&s;elf, &s;he had neither time, opportunity nor clue to unravel. All that was undoubted &s;eemed the affection of Mrs. Delvile, all that, on her own part, could be re&s;olved, was to &s;uppre&s;s her partiality till &s;he knew if it might properly be avowed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, who &s;aw her perturbation, led immediately to &s;ubjects of indifference, and talked upon them &s;o long, and with &s;o much ea&s;e, that Cecilia, recovering her compo&s;ure, began to think &s;he had been mi&s;taken, and that nothing was intended but a tranquil conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, however, as &s;he had quieted her apprehen&s;ions, &s;he &s;at &s;ilent her&s;elf, with a look that Cecilia ea&s;ily con&s;trued into thoughtful perplexity in what manner &s;he &s;hould introduce what &s;he meant to com|municate.</P>
<P>This pau&s;e was &s;ucceeded by her &s;peaking of Lady Honoria; <Q REND="inline">"how wild, how care|le&s;s, how incorrigible &s;he is! &s;he lo&s;t her mother early; and the Duke, who idolizes her, and who, marrying very late, is already an old man, &s;he rules entirely; with him, and a &s;upple governe&s;s, who has neither courage to oppo&s;e her, nor heart to wi&s;h well but to her own intere&s;t, &s;he has lived al|mo&s;t
<PB N="311" REF="310">
wholly. Lately, indeed, &s;he has come more into the world, but without even a de&s;ire of improvement, and with no view and no thought but to gratify her idle humour by laughing at whatever goes for|ward."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She certainly neither wants parts nor di&s;cernment,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and, when my mind is not occupied by other matters, I find her conver&s;ation entertaining and agreeable,"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"but that light &s;ort of wit which attacks, with equal alacrity, what is &s;erious or what is gay, is twenty times offen&s;ive, to once that it is exhilarating; &s;ince it &s;hews that while its only aim is &s;elf-diver&s;ion, it has the mo&s;t in&s;olent negligence with re&s;pect to any pain it gives to others. The rank of Lady Honoria, though it has not rendered her proud, nor even made her con&s;cious &s;he has any dignity to &s;upport, has yet given her a &s;aucy indifference whom &s;he plea|&s;es or hurts, that borders upon what in a woman is of all things the mo&s;t odious, a daring defiance of the world and its opi|nions."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, never le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to enter upon her defence, made but little an&s;wer; and &s;oon after, Mrs. Delvile added, <Q REND="inline">"I hearti|ly wi&s;h &s;he were properly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and
<PB N="312" REF="311">
yet, according to the pernicious manners and maxims of the pre&s;ent age, &s;he is per|haps more &s;ecure from mi&s;conduct while &s;ingle, than &s;he will be when married. Her father, I fear, will leave her too much to her&s;elf, and in that ca&s;e I &s;carce know what may become of her; &s;he has neither judge|ment nor principle to direct her choice, and therefore, in all probability, the &s;ame whim which one day will guide it, will the next lead her to repent it."</Q></P>
<P>Again they were both &s;ilent; and then Mrs. Delvile, gravely, yet with energy ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"How few are there, how very few, who marry at once upon principles rational, and feelings plea&s;ant! intere&s;t and inclination are eternally at &s;trife, and where either is wholly &s;acrificed, the other is in|adequate to happine&s;s. Yet how rarely do they divide the attention! the young are ra&s;h, and the aged are mercenary; their deliberations are never in concert, their views are &s;carce ever blended; one van|qui&s;hes, and the other &s;ubmits; neither party ten porizes, and commonly each is unhappy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The time,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"is now arrrived when reflections of this &s;ort can|not too &s;eriou&s;ly occupy me; the errors I have ob&s;erved in others, I would fain avoid committing; yet &s;uch is the blindne&s;s of
<PB N="313" REF="312">
&s;elf-love, that perhaps, even at the mo|ment I cen&s;ure them, I am falling, without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, into the &s;ame! nothing, how|ever, &s;hall through negligence be wrong; for where is the &s;on who merits care and attention, if Mortimer from his parents de|&s;erves not to meet them?"</Q></P>
<P>The expectations of Cecilia were now again awakened, and awakened with fre&s;h terrors le&s;t Mrs. Delvile, from compa&s;&s;ion, meant to offer her &s;ervices; vigorou&s;ly, therefore, &s;he determined to exert her&s;elf, and rather give up Mortimer and all thoughts of him for-ever, than &s;ubmit to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance in per&s;uading him to the union.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"is mo&s;t earne&s;t and impatient that &s;ome alliance &s;hould take place without further delay; and for my&s;elf, could I &s;ee him with propriety and with happine&s;s di&s;po&s;ed of, what a weight of anxiety would be removed from my heart!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now made an effort to &s;peak, attempting to &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"Certainly, it is a mat|ter of great con&s;equence;"</Q> but &s;o low was her voice, and &s;o confu&s;ed her manner, that Mrs. Delvile, though attentively li&s;|tening, heard not a word. She forbore, however, to make her repeat what &s;he &s;aid, and went on her&s;elf as if &s;peaking in an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="313">
<Q REND="inline">"Not only his own, but the peace of his whole family will depend upon his elec|tion, &s;ince he is the la&s;t of his race. This ca&s;tle and e&s;tate, and another in the north, were entailed upon him by the late Lord Delvile, his grandfather, who, di&s;obliged by his elde&s;t &s;on, the pre&s;ent lord, left every thing he had power to di&s;po&s;e of to his &s;e|cond &s;on, Mr. Delvile, and at his death, to his grand&s;on, Mortimer. And even the pre&s;ent lord, though always at variance with his brother, is fond of his nephew, and has declared him his heir. I, al&s;o, have one &s;i&s;ter, who is rich, who has no children, and who has made the &s;ame de|claration. Yet though with &s;uch high ex|pectations, he mu&s;t not connect him&s;elf imprudently; for his paternal e&s;tate wants repair, and he is well entitled with a wife to expect what it requires."</Q></P>
<P>Mo&s;t true! thought Cecilia, yet a&s;hamed of her recent failure, &s;he applied her&s;elf to her work, and would not again try to &s;peak.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is amiable, accompli&s;hed, well edu|cated, and well born; far may we look, and not meet with his equal; no woman need di&s;dain, and few women would refu&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia blu&s;hed her concurrence; yet
<PB N="315" REF="314">
could well at that moment have &s;pared hearing the eulogy,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet how difficult,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"to find a proper alliance! there are many who have &s;ome recommendations, but who is there wholly unexceptionable?"</Q></P>
<P>This que&s;tion &s;eemed unan&s;werable; nor could Cecilia devi&s;e what it meant.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Girls of high family have but &s;eldom large fortunes, &s;ince the heads of their hou&s;e commonly require their whole wealth for the &s;upport of their own dignity; while on the other hand, girls of large fortune are frequently ignorant, in&s;olent, or low born; kept up by their friends le&s;t they &s;hould fall a prey to adventurers, they have no ac|quaintance with the world, and little en|largement from education; their in&s;truc|tions are limited to a few merely youthful accompli&s;hments; the fir&s;t notion they im|bibe is of their own importance, the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on they are taught is the value of riches, and even from their cradles, their little minds are narrowed, and their &s;elf-&s;ufficien|cy is excited, by cautions to beware of fortune-hunters, and a&s;&s;urances that the whole world will be at their feet. Among &s;uch &s;hould we &s;eek a companion for Mor|timer? &s;urely not. Formed for dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and delighting in elegant &s;ociety,
<PB N="316" REF="315">
his mind would di&s;dain an alliance in which its affections had no &s;hare."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia colouring and trembling, thought now the moment of her trial was approach|ing, and half mortified and half frightened prepared her&s;elf to &s;u&s;tain it with firmne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I venture, therefore, my dear Mi&s;s Beverley, to &s;peak to you upon this &s;ubject as a friend who will have patience to hear my perplexities; you &s;ee upon what they hang,&mdash;where the birth is &s;uch as Mortimer Delvile may claim, the fortune generally fails; and where the fortune is adequate to his expectations, the birth yet more fre|quently would di&s;grace us."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, a&s;toni&s;hed by this &s;peech, and quite off her guard from momentary &s;ur|prize, involuntarily rai&s;ed her head to look at Mrs. Delvile, in who&s;e countenance &s;he ob&s;erved the mo&s;t anxious concern, though her manner of &s;peaking had &s;eemed placid and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Once,"</Q> &s;he continued, without appear|ing to remark the emotion of her auditor, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile thought of uniting him with his cou&s;in Lady Honoria; but he never could endure the propo&s;al; and who &s;hall blame his repugnance? her &s;i&s;ter, indeed, Lady Euphra&s;ia, is much preferable, her education has been better, and her fortune is much more con&s;iderable. At pre&s;ent,
<PB N="317" REF="316">
however, Mortimer &s;eems greatly aver&s;e to her, and who has a right to be difficult, if we deny it to him?"</Q></P>
<P>Wonder, uncertainty, expectation and &s;u&s;pence now all attacked Cecilia, and all harra&s;&s;ed her with redoubled violence; why &s;he was called to this conference &s;he knew not; the approbation &s;he had thought &s;o certain, &s;he doubted, and the propo&s;al of a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had apprehended, &s;he cea&s;ed to think would be offered: &s;ome fearful my&s;tery, &s;ome cruel ob&s;curity, &s;till clouded all her pro&s;pects, and not merely ob&s;tructed her view of the future, but made what was immediately before her gloomy and in|di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of her mind &s;eemed read by Mrs. Delvile, who examined her with eyes of &s;uch penetrating keenne&s;s, that they ra|ther made di&s;coveries than enquiries. She was &s;ilent &s;ome time, and looked irre&s;olute, how to proceed; but at length, &s;he aro&s;e, and taking Cecilia by the hand, who almo&s;t drew it back from her dread of what would follow, &s;he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I will torment you no more, my &s;weet young friend, with per|plexities which you cannot relieve: this only I will &s;ay, and then drop the &s;ubject for ever; when my &s;olicitude for Mortimer is removed, and he is e&s;tabli&s;hed to the &s;atisfaction of us all, no care will remain
<PB N="318" REF="317">
in the heart of his mother, half &s;o fervent, &s;o anxious and &s;o &s;incere as the di&s;po&s;al of my amiable Cecilia, for who&s;e welfare and happine&s;s my wi&s;hes are even maternal."</Q></P>
<P>She then ki&s;&s;ed her glowing cheek, and perceiving her almo&s;t &s;tupified with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, &s;pared her any effort to &s;peak, by ha&s;tily leaving her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her room.</P>
<P>Undeceived in her expectations and chil|led in her hopes, the heart of Cecilia no longer &s;truggled to &s;u&s;tain its dignity, or conceal its tenderne&s;s; the conflict was at an end, Mrs. Delvile had been open, though her &s;on was my&s;terious; but, in removing her doubts, &s;he had bereft her of her peace. She now found her own mi&s;take in buil|ding upon her approbation; &s;he &s;aw no|thing was le&s;s in her intentions, and that even when mo&s;t ardent in affectionate re|gard, &s;he &s;eparated her intere&s;t from that of her &s;on as if their union was a matter of utter impo&s;&s;ibility. <Q REND="inline">"Yet why,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"oh why is it deemed &s;o! that &s;he loves me, &s;he is ever eager to proclaim, that my fortune would be peculiarly u&s;e|ful, &s;he makes not a &s;ecret, and that I, at lea&s;t, &s;hould &s;tart no in&s;uperable objections, &s;he has, alas! but too obviou&s;ly di&s;covered! Has &s;he doubts of her &s;on?&mdash;no, &s;he has too much di&s;cernment; the father, then,
<PB N="319" REF="318">
the haughty, impracticable father, has de&s;|tined him for &s;ome woman of rank, and will li&s;ten to no other alliance."</Q></P>
<P>This notion &s;omewhat &s;oothed her in the di&s;apointment &s;he &s;uffered; yet to know her&s;elf betrayed to Mrs. Delvile, and to &s;ee no other con&s;equence en&s;ue but that of exciting a tender compa&s;&s;ion, which led her to di&s;courage, from benevolence, hopes too high to be indulged, was a mortification &s;o &s;evere, that it cau&s;ed her a deeper depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits than any occurrence of her life had yet occa&s;ioned. <Q REND="inline">"What Henrietta Belfield is to me,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I am to Mrs. Delvile! but what in her is amiable and artle&s;s, in me is di&s;graceful and un|worthy. And this is the &s;ituation which &s;o long I have de&s;ired! This is the change of habitation which I thought would make me &s;o happy! oh who can chu&s;e, who can judge for him&s;elf? who can point out the road to his own felicity, or decide upon the &s;pot where his peace will be en&s;ured!"</Q> Still, however, &s;he had &s;omething to do, &s;ome &s;pirit to exert, and &s;ome fortitude to mani|fe&s;t: Mortimer, &s;he was certain, &s;u&s;pected not his own power; his mother, &s;he knew, was both too good and too wi&s;e to reveal it to him, and &s;he determined, by caution and firmne&s;s upon his leave-taking and depar|ture, to retrieve, if po&s;&s;ible, that credit with
<PB N="320" REF="319">
Mrs. Delvile, which &s;he feared her betray|ed &s;u&s;ceptibility had weakened.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as &s;he recovered from her con&s;ternation, &s;he quitted Mrs. Delvile's apartment, amd &s;eeking Lady Honoria her&s;elf, determined not to &s;pend even a moment alone, till Mortimer was gone; le&s;t the &s;adne&s;s of her reflections &s;hould overpower her re&s;olution, and give a melancholy to her air and manner which he might attribute, with but too much ju&s;|tice, to concern upon his own account.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. AN ATTACK.</HEAD>
<P>AT dinner, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lord Ernolf, who was mo&s;t happy to give it, Cecilia &s;eemed tolerably ea&s;y. Lord Derford, too, encouraged by his father, endeavoured to engage &s;ome &s;hare of her attention; but he totally failed; her mind was &s;uperior to little arts of coquetry, and her pride had too much dignity to evapo|rate in pique; &s;he determined, therefore, at this time, as at all others, to be con&s;i&s;|tent in &s;hewing him he had no chance of her favour.</P>
<P>At tea, when they were again a&s;&s;embled, Mortimer's journey was the only &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and it was agreed that he &s;hould &s;et out very early in the morning, and, as the weather was extremely hot, not travel at all in the middle of the day.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria then, in a whi&s;per to Ce|cilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s Beverley, you will ri&s;e with the lark to-morrow morning? for your health, I mean. Early ri&s;ing, you know, is va&s;tly good for you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="321">
Cecilia, affecting not to under&s;tand her, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould ri&s;e, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, at her u&s;ual time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll tell Mortimer, however,"</Q> returned her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"to look up at your window before he goes off; for if he will play Ro|meo, you, I dare &s;ay, will play Juliet, and this old ca&s;tle is quite the thing for the mu&s;ty family of the Capulets: I dare &s;ay Shake&s;pear thought of it when he wrote of them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Say to him what you plea&s;e for your|&s;elf,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but let me entreat you to &s;ay nothing for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And my Lord Derford, continued &s;he, will make an exce&s;&s;ive pretty Paris, for he is va&s;tly in love, though he has got nothing to &s;ay; but what &s;hall we do for a Mercutio? we may find 500 whining Romeos to one gay and charming Mercutio. Be&s;ides, Mrs. Delvile, to do her ju&s;tice, is really too good for the old Nur&s;e, though Mr. Del|vile him&s;elf may &s;erve for all the Capulets and all the Montagues at once, for he has pride enough for both their hou&s;es, and twenty more be&s;ides. By the way, if I don't take care, I &s;hall have this Romeo run away before I have made my little dainty country Paris pick a quarrel with him."</Q></P>
<P>She then walked up to one of the win|dows,
<PB N="323" REF="322">
and motioning Lord Derford to follow her, Cecilia heard her &s;ay to him, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my lord, have you writ your letter? and have you &s;ent it? Mi&s;s Beverley, I a&s;|&s;ure you, will be charmed beyond mea&s;ure by &s;uch a piece of gallantry."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;imple young lord, <Q REND="inline">"I have not &s;ent it yet, for I have only writ a foul copy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my lord,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that is the very thing you ought to &s;end! a foul copy of a challenge is always better than a fair one, for it looks written with more agita|tion. I am va&s;tly glad you mentioned that."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, ri&s;ing and joining them, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What mi&s;chief is Lady Honoria about now? we mu&s;t all be upon our guards, my lord, for &s;he has a &s;pirit of diver&s;ion that will not &s;pare us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray why do you interfere?"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, and then, in a lower voice, &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"what do you apprehend? do you &s;uppo&s;e Mortimer cannot manage &s;uch a poor little ideot as this?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't &s;uppo&s;e any thing about the matter!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, don't interrupt my opera|tions. Lord Derford, Mi&s;s Beverley has been whi&s;pering me, that if you put this
<PB N="324" REF="323">
&s;cheme in execution, &s;he &s;hall find you, ever after, irre&s;i&s;tible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Derford, I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"is too well acquainted with your lady&s;hip to be in any danger of cre|dulity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Va&s;tly well!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you are determined to provoke me, &s;o if you &s;poil my &s;chemes, I will &s;poil yours, and tell a certain gentleman your tender terrors for his &s;afety."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, extremely alarmed, mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreated her to be quiet; but the di&s;covery of her fright only excited her lady&s;hip's laughter, and, with a look the mo&s;t mi&s;chievou&s;ly wicked, &s;he called out <Q REND="inline">"Pray Mr. Mortimer, come hither!"</Q></P>
<P>Mortimer in&s;tantly obeyed; and Cecilia at the &s;ame moment would with plea&s;ure have endured almo&s;t any puni&s;hment to have been twenty miles off.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have &s;omething,"</Q> continued her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to communicate to you. We have been &s;et|tling an admirable plan for you; will you promi&s;e to be guided by us if I tell it you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O certainly!"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> that would di&s;grace us all round."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Well, then,&mdash;Mi&s;s Beverley, have you any objection to my proceeding?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="324">
<Q REND="inline">"None at all!"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, who had the under&s;tanding to know that the greate&s;t excitement to ridicule is oppo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, I mu&s;t tell you,"</Q> &s;he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"it is the advice of us all, that as &s;oon as you come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your e&s;tate, you make &s;ome capital al|terations in this antient ca&s;tle."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, greatly relieved, could with gra|titude have embraced her: and Mortimer, very certain that &s;uch rattle was all her own, promi&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her or|ders, and begged her further directions, declaring that he could not, at lea&s;t, de&s;ire a fairer architect.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What we mean,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"may be effected with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e; it is only to take out the&s;e old windows, and fix &s;ome thick iron grates in their place, and &s;o turn the ca&s;tle into a gaol for the county.</Q></P>
<P>Mortimer laughed heartily at this propo|&s;ition; but his father, unfortunately hear|ing it, &s;ternly advanced, and with great au&s;terity &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If I thought my &s;on capa|ble of putting &s;uch an in&s;ult upon his an|ce&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> whatever may be the value I feel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> I would bani&s;h him my pre&s;ence for ever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear &s;ir,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"how would his ance&s;tors ever know it?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="325">
<Q REND="inline">"How?&mdash;why&mdash;that is a very extraor|dinary que&s;tion, Lady Honoria!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ides, &s;ir, I dare &s;ay the &s;heriff, or the mayor and corporation, or &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ort of people, would give him money enough, for the u&s;e of it, to run him up a mighty pretty neat little box &s;omewhere near Richmond."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A box!"</Q> exclaimed he indignantly; <Q REND="inline">"a neat little box for the heir of an e&s;tate &s;uch as this!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I only mean,"</Q> cried &s;he, giddily, <Q REND="inline">"that he might have &s;ome place a little more plea&s;ant to live in, for really that old moat and draw-bridge are enough to vapour him to death; I cannot for my life imagine any u&s;e they are of: unle&s;s, indeed, to frighten away the deer, for nothing el&s;e offers to come over. But, if you were to turn the hou&s;e into a gaol&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A gaol?"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, &s;till more angrily, <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip mu&s;t pardon me if I entreat you not to mention that word again when you are plea&s;ed to &s;peak of Delvile ca&s;tle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear &s;ir, why not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e it is a term that, in it&s;elf, from a young lady, has a &s;ound peculiarly improper; and which, applied to any gen|tleman's antient family &s;eat,&mdash;a thing, lady Honor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a, always re&s;pectable, however light|ly &s;poken or!&mdash;has an effect the lea&s;t agre|eable
<PB N="327" REF="326">
that can be devi&s;ed: for it implies an idea either that the family, or the man&s;ion, is going into decay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Well, &s;ir, you know, with regard to the man&s;ion, it is certainly very true, for all that other &s;ide, by the old tower, looks as if it would fall upon one's head every time one is forced to pa&s;s it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t, Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that old tower, of which you are plea&s;ed to &s;peak &s;o &s;lightingly, is the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony to the antiquity of the ca&s;tle of any now remaining, and I would not part with it for all the new boxes, as you &s;tyle them, in the kingdom."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I am very glad of it, &s;ir, for I dare &s;ay nobody would give even one of them for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Lady Honoria, you are greatly mi&s;taken; they would give a thou|&s;and; &s;uch a thing, belonging to a man from his own ance&s;tors, is invaluable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, dear &s;ir, what in the world could they do with it? unle&s;s, indeed, they were to let &s;ome man paint it for an opera &s;cene."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A worthy u&s;e indeed!"</Q> cried Mr. Del|vile, more and more affronted: <Q REND="inline">"and pray does your lady&s;hip talk thus to my Lord Duke?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes; and he never minds it at all."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="327">
<Q REND="inline">"It were &s;trange if he did!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"my only a&s;toni&s;hment is that any body can be found who <HI>does</HI> mind it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why now, Mrs. Delvile,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"pray be &s;incere; can you po&s;&s;ibly think this gothic ugly old place at all compara|ble to any of the new villas about town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gothic ugly old place!"</Q> repeated Mr. Delvile, in utter amazement at her daunt|le&s;s flightine&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip really does my humble dwelling too much honour!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, I beg a thou&s;and pardons!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I really did not think of what I was &s;aying. Come, dear Mi&s;s Beverley, and walk out with me, for I am too much &s;hocked to &s;tay a moment longer."</Q></P>
<P>And then, taking Cecilia by the arm, &s;he hurried her into the park, through a door which led thither from the parlour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For heaven's &s;ake, Lady Honoria,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"could you find no better entertainment for Mr. Delvile than ridicu|ling his own hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried &s;he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"did you never hear us quarrel before? why when I was here la&s;t &s;ummer, I u&s;ed to affront him ten times a day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was that a regular ceremony?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, really, I did not do it purpo&s;ely; but it &s;o happened; either by talking of the ca&s;tle, or the tower, or the draw-bridge,
<PB N="329" REF="328">
or the fortifications; or wi&s;hing they were all employed to fill up that odious moat; or &s;omething of that &s;ort; for you know a &s;mall matter will put him out of hu|mour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you call it &s;o &s;mall a matter to wi&s;h a man's whole habitation annihi|lated?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, I don't wi&s;h any thing about it! I only &s;ay &s;o to provoke him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what &s;trange plea&s;ure can that give you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O the greate&s;t in the world! I take much delight in &s;eeing any body in a pa&s;|&s;ion. It makes them look &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ugly!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is that the way you like <HI>every</HI> body &s;hould look, Lady Honoria?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my dear, if you mean <HI>me,</HI> I never was in a pa&s;&s;ion twice in my life: for as &s;oon as ever I have provoked the people, I always run away. But &s;ometimes I am in a dreadful fright le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee me laugh, for they make &s;uch horrid grimaces it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to look at them. When my father has been angry with me, I have &s;ometimes been obliged to pretend I was crying, by way of excu&s;e for putting my handkerchief to my face: for really he looks &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hideous, you would
<PB N="330" REF="329">
&s;uppo&s;e he was making mouths, like the children, merely to frighten one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Amazing!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"your lady&s;hip can, indeed, never want diver&s;ion, to find it in the anger of your father. But does it give you no other &s;en&s;ation? are you not afraid?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O never! what can he do to me, you know? he can only &s;torm a little, and &s;wear a little, for he always &s;wears when he is angry; and perhaps order me to my own room; and ten to one but that hap|pens to be the very thing I want; for we never quarrel but when we are alone, and then it's &s;o dull, I am always wi&s;hing to run away."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">And can you take no other method of leaving him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I think none &s;o ea&s;ily: and it can do him no harm, you know; I often tell him, when we make friends, that if it were not for a po&s;tilion and his daugh|ter, he would be quite out of practice in &s;colding and &s;wearing: for whenever he is upon the road he does nothing el&s;e: though why he is in &s;uch a hurry, nobody can di|vine, for go whither he will he has nothing to do."</Q></P>
<P>Thus ran on this flighty lady, happy in high animal &s;pirits, and carele&s;s who was

<P><Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip is extremely good! but I am glad to be apprized of your intention, as it will enable me to &s;ave you that trouble."</Q></P>
<P>She then turned quick back, and pa&s;&s;ing Lord Derford, who &s;till walked on towards Lady Honoria, &s;he returned to the hou&s;e; but, upon entering the parlour, found all the company di&s;per&s;ed, Delvile alone excepted, who was walking about the room, with his tablets in his hand, in which he had been writing.</P>
<P>From a mixture of &s;hame and &s;urprize, Cecilia, at the &s;ight of him, was involun|tarily retreating; but, ha&s;tening to the door, he called out in a reproachful tone, <Q REND="inline">"Will you not even enter the &s;ame room with me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes,"</Q> cried &s;he, returning; <Q REND="inline">"I was only afraid I di&s;turbed you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, an&s;wered he, gravely; you are the only per&s;on who could <HI>not</HI> di&s;turb me, &s;ince my employment was

making memorandums for a letter to your|&s;elf: with which, however, I did not de&s;ire to importune you, but that you have denied me the honour of even a five minutes audience."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion at this attack, knew not whether to &s;tand &s;till or proceed; but, as he pre&s;ently continued his &s;peech, &s;he found &s;he had no choice but to &s;tay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be &s;orry to quit this place, e&s;pecially as the length of my ab&s;ence is extremely uncertain, while I have the un|happine&s;s to be under your di&s;plea&s;ure, without making &s;ome little attempt to apo|logize for the behaviour which incurred it.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia <Q REND="inline">"died with its occa&s;ion; I beg, therefore, that it may re&s;t no longer in your remem|brance."</Q></P>

by the calmne&s;s with which he &s;poke him|&s;elf, made no oppo&s;ition to his reque&s;t, but &s;uffering him to &s;hut both the door leading into the garden, and that which led into the hall, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at one of the win|dows, determined to li&s;ten with intrepidity to this long expected explanation.</P>
<P>The preparations, however, which he made to obviate being overheard, added to the &s;teadine&s;s with which Cecilia waited his further proceedings, &s;oon robbed him of the courage with which he began the a&s;&s;ault, and evidently gave him a wi&s;h of retreating him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At length, after much he&s;itation, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"This indulgence, madam, de&s;erves my mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments; it is, indeed, what I had little right, and &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on, after the &s;everity I have met with from you, to expect."</Q></P>
<P>And here, at the very mention of &s;eve|rity, his courage, called upon by his pride, in&s;tantly returned, and he went on with the &s;ame &s;pirit he had begun.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That &s;everity, however, I mean not to lament; on the contrary, in a &s;ituation &s;uch as mine, it was perhaps the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing I could receive; I have found from it, in|deed, more advantage and relief than from all that philo&s;ophy, reflection or fortitude could offer. It has &s;hewn me the vanity of
<PB N="334" REF="333">
bewailing the barrier, placed by fate to my wi&s;hes, &s;ince it has &s;hewn me that another, le&s;s inevitable, but equally in&s;uperable, would have oppo&s;ed them. I have deter|mined, therefore, after a &s;truggle I mu&s;t confe&s;s the mo&s;t painful, to deny my&s;elf the dangerous &s;olace of your &s;ociety, and en|deavour, by joining di&s;&s;ipation to rea&s;on, to forget the too great plea&s;ure which hitherto it has afforded me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ea&s;y, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"will be your ta&s;k: "I can only wi&s;h the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your health may be found no more diffi|cult."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam,"</Q> cried he, with a re|proachful &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>he je&s;ts at &s;cars who never felt a wound!</HI>&mdash;but this is a &s;train in which I have no right to talk, and I will neither of|fend your delicacy, nor my own integrity, by endeavouring to work upon the genero|&s;ity of your di&s;po&s;ition in order to excite your compa&s;&s;ion. Not &s;uch was the motive with which I begged this audience; but merely a de&s;ire, before I tear my&s;elf away, to open to you my heart, without palliation or re&s;erve."</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a few moments; and Cecilia finding her &s;u&s;picions ju&s;t that this inter|view was meant to be final, con&s;idered that her trial, however &s;evere, would be &s;hort, and called forth all her re&s;olution to &s;u&s;tain it with &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="334">
<Q REND="inline">"Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"your character and your accompli&s;hments were known to me: Mr. Biddulph of Suffolk, who was my fir&s;t friend at Oxford, and with whom my intimacy is &s;till undimini&s;hed, was early &s;en|&s;ible of your excellencies: we corre&s;pond|ed, and his letters were filled with your prai&s;es. He confe&s;&s;ed to me, that his ad|miration had been unfortunate:&mdash;alas! I might now make the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion to him!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Biddulph, among many of the neigh|bouring gentlemen, had made propo&s;als to the Dean for Cecilia, which, at her de&s;ire, were rejected.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When Mr. Harrel &s;aw ma&s;ks in Port|man-&s;quare, my curio&s;ity to behold a lady &s;o adored, and &s;o cruel, led me thither; your dre&s;s made you ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash;Ah Mi&s;s Beverley! I venture not to men|tion what I then felt for my friend! I will only &s;ay that &s;omething which I felt for my&s;elf, warned me in&s;tantly to avoid you, &s;ince the clau&s;e in your uncle's will was al|ready well known to me."</Q></P>
<P>Now, then, at la&s;t, thought Cecilia, all perplexity is over!&mdash;the change of name is the ob&s;tacle; he inherits all the pride of his family,&mdash;and therefore to that family will I unrepining leave him!</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="335">
<Q REND="inline">"This warning,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not have di&s;regarded, had I not, at the Opera, been deceived into a belief you were engaged; I then wi&s;hed no longer to &s;hun you; bound in honour to forbear all efforts at &s;upplanting a man, to whom I thought you almo&s;t united, I con&s;idered you already as married, and eagerly as I &s;ought your &s;o|ciety, I &s;ought it not with more plea&s;ure than innocence. Yet even then, to be can|did, I found in my&s;elf a re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s about your affairs that kept me in eternal pertur|bation: but I flattered my&s;elf it was mere curio&s;ity, and only excited by the perpetu|al change of opinion to which occa&s;ion gave ri&s;e, concerning which was the happy man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, coolly, <Q REND="inline">"there was any &s;uch mi&s;take."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not, madam, fatigue you,"</Q> he returned, <Q REND="inline">"by tracing the progre&s;s of my unfortunate admiration; I will endeavour to be more brief, for I &s;ee you are already wearied."</Q> He &s;topt a moment, hoping for &s;ome little encouragement; but Cecilia, in no humour to give it, a&s;&s;umed an air of unconcern, and &s;at wholly quiet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew not,"</Q> he then went on, with a look of extreme mortification, <Q REND="inline">"the warmth with which I honoured your virtues, till you deigned to plead to me for Mr. Belfield,&mdash;
<PB N="337" REF="336">
but let me not recollect the feelings of that moment!&mdash;yet were they nothing,&mdash;cold, languid, lifele&s;s to what I afterwards expe|rienced, when you undeceived me finally with re&s;pect to your &s;ituation, and informed me the report concerning Sir Robert Floyer was equally erroneous with that which con|cerned Belfield! O what was the agitation of my whole &s;oul at that in&s;tant!&mdash;to know you di&s;engaged,&mdash;to &s;ee you before me,&mdash;by the di&s;order of my whole frame to di&s;cover the mi&s;take I had cheri&s;hed&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, half ri&s;ing, yet again &s;eating her&s;elf, looked extremely impatient to be gone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, madam,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"I will have done, and trace my feelings and my &s;ufferings no longer, but ha&s;ten, for my own &s;ake as well as yours, to the rea&s;on why I have &s;poken at all. From the hour that my ill-de&s;tined pa&s;&s;ion was fully known to my&s;elf, I weighed all the con&s;equences of indulging it, and found, added to the ex|treme hazard of &s;ucce&s;s, an impropriety even in the attempt. <HI>My</HI> honour in the honour of my family is bound; what to that would &s;eem wrong, in me would be unju&s;tifiable: yet where inducements &s;o numerous were oppo&s;ed by one &s;ingle ob|jection!&mdash;where virtue, beauty, education and family were all unexceptionable,&mdash;Oh
<PB N="338" REF="337">
cruel clau&s;e! barbarous and repul&s;ive clau&s;e! that forbids my a&s;piring to the fir&s;t of wo|men, but by an action that with my own family would degrade me for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, overpowered by his own emo|tion, and Cecilia aro&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, madam,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"your eagerne&s;s to be gone, and however at this moment I may lament it, I &s;hall recollect it hereafter with advantage. But to conclude: I determined to avoid you, and, by avoiding, to endeavour to for|get you: I determined, al&s;o, that no hu|man being, and your&s;elf lea&s;t of all, &s;hould know, &s;hould even &s;u&s;pect the &s;ituation of my mind: and though upon various occa|&s;ions, my prudence and forbearance have &s;uddenly yielded to &s;urpri&s;e and to pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;urrender has been &s;hort, and almo&s;t, I believe, unnoticed.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This &s;ilence and this avoidance I &s;u&s;|tained with decent con&s;tancy, till during the &s;torm, in an ill-fated moment, I &s;aw, or thought I &s;aw you in &s;ome danger, and then, all caution off guard, all re&s;olution &s;ur|pri&s;ed, every pa&s;&s;ion awake, and tenderne&s;s triumphant&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"and for what purpo&s;e all this?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, I know not!"</Q> &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"I thought my&s;elf better quali|fied for this conference, and meant to be
<PB N="339" REF="338">
firm and conci&s;e. I have told my &s;tory ill, but as your own under&s;tanding will point out the cau&s;e, your own benevolence will perhaps urge &s;ome excu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Too certain, &s;ince that unfortunate accident, that all di&s;gui&s;e was vain, and con|vinced by your di&s;plea&s;ure of the impro|priety of which I had been guilty, I deter|mined, as the only apology I could offer, to open to you my whole heart, and then fly you perhaps for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This, madam, incoherently indeed, yet with &s;incerity, I have now done: my &s;ufferings and my conflicts I do not men|tion, for I dare not! O were I to paint to you the bitter &s;truggles of a mind all at war with it&s;elf,&mdash;Duty, &s;pirit, and fortitude, combating love, happine&s;s and inclination,&mdash;each conquering alternately, and alter|nately each vanqui&s;hed,&mdash;I could endure it no longer, I re&s;olved by one effort to fini&s;h the &s;trife, and to undergo an in&s;tant of even exqui&s;ite torture, in preference to a conti|nuance of &s;uch lingering mi&s;ery!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The re&s;toration of your health, Sir, and &s;ince you fancy it has been injured, of your happine&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"will, I hope, be as &s;peedy, as I doubt not they are certain."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Since I fancy it has been injured!</HI>"</Q> re|peated he; <Q REND="inline">"what a phra&s;e, after an avowal &s;uch as mine! But why &s;hould I wi&s;h to
<PB N="340" REF="339">
convince you of my &s;incerity, when to you it cannot be more indifferent, than to my|&s;elf it is unfortunate! I have now only to entreat your pardon for the robbery I have committed upon your time, and to repeat my acknowledgments that you have endea|voured to hear me with patience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you honour me, Sir, with &s;ome por|tion of your e&s;teem,"</Q> &s;aid the offended Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e acknowledgments, perhaps, &s;hould be mine; &s;uppo&s;e them, however made, for I have a letter to write, and can therefore &s;tay no longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor do I pre&s;ume, madam,"</Q> cried he proudly, <Q REND="inline">"to detain you: hitherto you may frequently have thought me my&s;teri|ous, &s;ometimes &s;trange and capricious, and perhaps almo&s;t always, unmeaning; to clear my&s;elf from the&s;e imputations, by a candid confe&s;&s;ion of the motives which have go|verned me, is all that I wi&s;hed. Once, al&s;o&mdash;I hope but once,&mdash;you thought me impertinent,&mdash;there, indeed, I le&s;s dare vin|dicate my&s;elf&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no occa&s;ion, Sir,"</Q> interrupt|ed &s;he, walking towards the door, <Q REND="inline">"for further vindication in any thing; I am per|fectly &s;atisfied, and if my good wi&s;hes are worth your acceptance, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf you po&s;&s;e&s;s them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Barbarous, and in&s;ulting!"</Q> cried he,
<PB N="341" REF="340">
half to him&s;elf; and then, with a quick motion ha&s;tening to open the door for her, <Q REND="inline">"Go, madam,"</Q> he added, almo&s;t breath|le&s;s with conflicting emotions, <Q REND="inline">"go, and be your happine&s;s unalterable as your in|flexibility!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was turning back to an&s;wer this reproach, but the &s;ight of Lady Honoria, who was entering at the other door, deter|red her, and &s;he went on.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to her own room, &s;he walked about it &s;ome time in a &s;tate &s;o un|&s;ettled, between anger and di&s;appointment, &s;orrow and pride, that &s;he &s;carce knew to which emotion to give way, and felt almo&s;t bur&s;ting with each.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The dye, &s;he cried, is at la&s;t thrown; and this affair is concluded for ever! Del|vile him&s;elf is content to relinqui&s;h me; no father has commanded, no mother has in|terfered, he has required no admonition, full well enabled to act for him&s;elf by the powerful in&s;tigation of hereditary arro|gance! Yet my family, he &s;ays,&mdash;unex|pected conde&s;cen&s;ion! my family and every other circum&s;tance is unexceptionable; how feeble, then, is that regard which yields to one only objection! how potent that haugh|tine&s;s which to nothing will give way! Well, let him keep his name! &s;ince &s;o wonderous its properties, &s;o all-&s;ufficient its

pre&s;ervation, what vanity, what pre&s;ump|tion in me, to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf an equivalent for its lo&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>Thus, deeply offended, her &s;pirits were &s;upported by re&s;entment, and not only while in company, but when alone, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;carce aver&s;e to the approach|ing &s;eparation, and enabled to endure it without repining.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A RETREAT.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Cecilia aro&s;e late, not only to avoid the raillery of Lady Honoria, but to e&s;cape &s;eeing the depar|ture of Delvile; &s;he knew that the &s;pirit with which &s;he had left him, made him, at pre&s;ent, think her wholly in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;he was at lea&s;t happy to be &s;pared the mortifi|cation of a di&s;covery, &s;ince &s;he found him thus content, without even &s;olicitation, to re&s;ign her.</P>
<P>Before &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, Lady Honoria ran into her room, <Q REND="inline">"A new &s;cheme of po|litics!"</Q> &s;he cried; <Q REND="inline">"our great &s;tate&s;man intends to leave us: he can't tru&s;t his baby out of his &s;ight, &s;o he is going to nur&s;e him while upon the road him&s;elf. Poor pretty dear Mortimer! what a puppet do they make of him! I have a va&s;t inclination to get a pap-boat my&s;elf, and make him a pre|&s;ent of it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then enquired further particulars, and heard that Mr. Delvile purpo&s;ed ac|companying his &s;on to Bri&s;tol, who&s;e jour|ney,
<PB N="344" REF="343">
therefore, was po&s;tponed for a few hours to give time for new preparations.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, who, upon this occa&s;ion, thought him&s;elf overwhelmed with bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e, before his departure, he had &s;ome directions to give to his dome&s;tics, cho&s;e to breakfa&s;t in his own apartment: Mrs. Del|vile, al&s;o, wi&s;hing for &s;ome private conver|&s;ation with her &s;on, invited him to partake of her's in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;ending an apology to her gue&s;ts, and begging they would order their breakfa&s;ts when they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, &s;crupulous in ceremony, had made &s;undry apologies to Lord Ernolf for leaving him; but his real anxiety for his &s;on overpowering his artificial character, the excu&s;es he gave to that nobleman were &s;uch as could not po&s;&s;ibly offend; and the views of his lord&s;hip him&s;elf in his vi&s;it, being nothing interrupted, &s;o long as Ceci|lia continued at the ca&s;tle, he readily en|gaged, as a proof that he was not affronted, to remain with Mrs. Delvile till his return.</P>
<P>Cecilia, therefore, had her breakfa&s;t with the two lords and Lady Honoria; and when it was over, Lord Ernolf propo&s;ed to his &s;on riding the fir&s;t &s;tage with the two Mr. Delviles on hor&s;eback. This was agreed upon, and they left the room: and then Lady Honoria, full of frolic and gaiety,
<PB N="345" REF="344">
&s;eized one of the napkins, and prote&s;ted &s;he would &s;end it to Mortimer for a <HI>&s;labbering|bib:</HI> &s;he therefore made it up in a parcel, and wrote upon the in&s;ide of the paper with which &s;he envelloped it, <Q REND="inline">"A <HI>pin-a-fore</HI> for Ma&s;ter Mortimer Delvile, le&s;t he &s;hould daub his pappy when he is feeding him."</Q> Eager to have this properly conveyed, &s;he then ran out, to give it in charge to her own man, who was to pre&s;ent him with it as he got into the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>She had but ju&s;t quitted the room, when the door of it was again opened, and by Mortimer him&s;elf, booted, and equipped for his journey.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley here! and alone!"</Q> cried he, with a look, and in a voice, which &s;hewed that all the pride of the pre|ceding evening was &s;unk into the deepe&s;t dejection; <Q REND="inline">"and does &s;he not fly as I ap|proach her? can &s;he patiently bear in her &s;ight one &s;o &s;trange, &s;o fiery, &s;o incon&s;i&s;t|ent? But &s;he is too wi&s;e to re&s;ent the rav|ings of a madman;&mdash;and who, under the influence of a pa&s;&s;ion at once hopele&s;s and violent, can boa&s;t, but at intervals, full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, utterly a&s;toni&s;hed by a gentle|ne&s;s &s;o humble, looked at him in &s;ilent &s;ur|pri&s;e; he advanced to her mournfully, and added, <Q REND="inline">"I am a&s;hamed, indeed, of the bit|terne&s;s
<PB N="346" REF="345">
of &s;pirit with which I la&s;t night pro|voked your di&s;plea&s;ure, when I &s;hould have &s;upplicated your lenity: but though I was prepared for your coldne&s;s, I could not en|dure it, and though your indifference was almo&s;t friendly, it made me little le&s;s than frantic; &s;o &s;trangely may ju&s;tice be blind|ed by pa&s;&s;ion, and every faculty of rea&s;on be warped by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have no apology to make, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince, believe me, I require none."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may well,"</Q> returned he, half-&s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;pen&s;e with my apologies, &s;ince under the &s;anction of that word, I obtained your hearing ye&s;terday. But, believe me, you will now find me far more rea&s;onable; a whole night's reflections&mdash;reflections which no repo&s;e interrupted!&mdash;have brought me to my &s;en&s;es. Even lunatics, you know, have lucid moments!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you intend, Sir, to &s;et off &s;oon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe &s;o; I wait only for my fa|ther. But why is Mi&s;s Beverley &s;o impa|tient? I &s;hall not &s;oon <HI>return;</HI> that, at lea&s;t, is certain, and, for a few in&s;tants delay, may &s;urely offer &s;ome palliation;&mdash;See! if I am not ready to again accu&s;e you of &s;everity!&mdash;I mu&s;t run, I find, or all my boa&s;ted reformation will end but in fre&s;h offence, fre&s;h di&s;grace, and fre&s;h contrition!
<PB N="347" REF="346">
Adieu, madam!&mdash;and may all pro&s;perity attend you! That will be ever my darling wi&s;h, however long my ab&s;ence, however di&s;tant the climates which may part us!"</Q> He was then hurrying away, but Cecilia, from an impul&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e too &s;udden to be re&s;trained, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"The climates?&mdash;do you, then, mean to leave England?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"for why &s;hould I remain in it? a few weeks only could I fill up in any tour &s;o near home, and hither in a few weeks to return would be folly and madne&s;s: in an ab&s;ence &s;o brief, what thought but that of the ap|proaching meeting would occupy me? and what, at that meeting, &s;hould I feel, but joy the mo&s;t dangerous, and delight which I dare not think of!&mdash;every conflict renew|ed, every &s;truggle re-felt, again all this &s;cene would require to be acted, again I mu&s;t tear my&s;elf away, and every tumul|tuous pa&s;&s;ion now beating in my heart would be revived, and, if po&s;&s;ible, be re|vived with added mi&s;ery!&mdash;No!&mdash;neither my temper nor my con&s;titution will endure &s;uch another &s;hock, one parting &s;hall &s;uf|fice, and the fortitude with which I will lengthen my &s;elf-exile, &s;hall atone to my|&s;elf for the weakne&s;s which makes it requi|&s;ite!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, with a vehemence that &s;eem|ed
<PB N="348" REF="347">
fearful of the &s;malle&s;t delay, he was again, and yet more ha&s;tily going, when Cecilia, with much emotion, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Two moments, Sir!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Two thou&s;and! two million!"</Q> cried he, impetuou&s;ly, and returning, with a look of the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, he added, <Q REND="inline">"What is it Mi&s;s Beverley will conde&s;cend to command?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing,"</Q> cried &s;he, recovering her pre&s;ence of mind, <Q REND="inline">"but to beg you will by no means, upon my account, quit your country and your friends, &s;ince another a&s;ylum can be found for my&s;elf, and &s;ince I would much &s;ooner part from Mrs. Del|vile, greatly and &s;incerely as I reverence her, than be in&s;trumental to robbing her, even for a month, of her &s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Generous and humane is the con&s;idera|tion,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"but who half &s;o gener|ous, &s;o humane as Mi&s;s Beverley? &s;o &s;oft to all others, &s;o noble in her&s;elf?

<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who now felt her courage decline, and the &s;oft|ne&s;s of &s;orrow &s;teal fa&s;t upon her &s;pirits, <Q REND="inline">"if you will not give up your &s;cheme, let me no longer detain you."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,&mdash;very &s;incerely."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you pardon the unguarded errors which have offended you?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Farewell, then, mo&s;t amiable of wo|men, and may every ble&s;&s;ing you de&s;erve light on your head!

<P>Cecilia, though &s;he tru&s;ted not her voice
<PB N="350" REF="349">
to reprove him, forced away her hand, and then, in the utmo&s;t perturbation, he ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>This &s;cene for Cecilia, was the mo&s;t un|fortunate that could have happened; the gentlene&s;s of Delvile was alone &s;ufficient to melt her, &s;ince her pride had no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence when not fed by his own; and while his mildne&s;s had blunted her di&s;plea&s;ure, his angui&s;h had penetrated her heart. Lo&s;t in thought and in &s;adne&s;s, &s;he continued fixed to her &s;eat; and looking at the door through which he had pa&s;&s;ed, as if, with him&s;elf, he had &s;hut out all for which &s;he exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>This pen&s;ive dejection was not long un|interrupted; Lady Honoria came running back, with intelligence, in what manner &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of her napkin, and Cecilia in li&s;tening, endeavoured to find &s;ome diver|&s;ion; but her lady&s;hip, though volatile not undi&s;cerning, &s;oon perceived that her at|tention was con&s;trained, and looking at her with much archne&s;s, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I believe, my dear, I mu&s;t find another napkin for <HI>you!</HI> not, however, for your <HI>mouth,</HI> but for your <HI>eyes!</HI> Has Mortimer been in to take leave of you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take leave of me?&mdash;No,&mdash;is he gone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, Pappy has a world of bu&s;i|ne&s;s to &s;ettle fir&s;t; he won't be ready the&s;e
<PB N="351" REF="350">
two hours. But don't look &s;o &s;orrowful, for I'll run and bring Mortimer to con&s;ole you."</Q></P>
<P>Away &s;he flew, and Cecilia, who had no power to prevent her, finding her &s;pirits un|equal either to another parting, or to the raillery of Lady Honoria, &s;hould Mortimer, for his own &s;ake, avoid it, took refuge in flight, and &s;eizing an umbrella, e&s;caped in|to the Park; where, to perplex any pur&s;u|ers, in&s;tead of chu&s;ing her u&s;ual walk, &s;he directed her &s;teps to a thick and unfre|quented wood, and never re&s;ted till &s;he was more than two miles from the hou&s;e. Fi|del, however, who now always accompani|ed her, ran by her &s;ide, and, when &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;ufficiently di&s;tant and pri|vate to be &s;afe, &s;he &s;at down under a tree, and care&s;&s;ing her faithful favourite, &s;oothed her own tenderne&s;s by lamenting that <HI>he</HI> had lo&s;t his ma&s;ter; and, having now no part to act, and no dignity to &s;upport, no ob&s;erva|tion to fear, and no inference to guard again&s;t, &s;he gave vent to her long &s;mother|ed emotions, by weeping without caution or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>She had met with an object who&s;e cha|racter an&s;wered all her wi&s;hes for him with whom &s;he &s;hould entru&s;t her fortune, and who&s;e turn of mind, &s;o &s;imilar to her own, promi&s;ed her the highe&s;t dome&s;tic felicity:
<PB N="352" REF="351">
to this object her affections had involunta|rily bent, they were &s;econded by e&s;teem, and unchecked by any &s;u&s;picion of impropriety in her choice: &s;he had found too, in return, that his heart was all her own: her birth, indeed, was inferior, but it was not di&s;|graceful; her di&s;po&s;ition, education and temper &s;eemed equal to his fonde&s;t wi&s;hes: yet, at the very time when their union ap|peared mo&s;t likely, when they mixed with the &s;ame &s;ociety, and dwelt under the &s;ame roof, when the father to one, was the guar|dian to the other, and intere&s;t &s;eemed to in|vite their alliance even more than affection, the young man him&s;elf, without coun&s;el or command, could tear him&s;elf from her pre&s;ence by an effort all his own, forbear to &s;eek her heart, and almo&s;t charge her not to grant it, and determining upon volun|tary exile, quit his country and his con|nections with no view, and for no rea&s;on, but merely that he might avoid the &s;ight of her he loved!</P>
<P>Though the motive for this conduct was now no longer unknown to her, &s;he neither thought it &s;atisfactory nor nece&s;&s;ary; yet, while &s;he cen&s;ured his flight, &s;he bewailed his lo&s;s, and though his inducement was repugnant to her opinion, his command over his pa&s;&s;ions &s;he admired and applauded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A WORRY.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA continued in this private &s;pot, happy at lea&s;t to be alone, till &s;he was &s;ummoned by the dinner bell to return home.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he entered the parlour, where every body was a&s;&s;embled before her, &s;he ob&s;erved, by the countenance of Mrs. Delvile, that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the morn|ing as &s;adly as her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,</Q> "cried Lady Honoria, before &s;he was &s;eated, <Q REND="inline">"I in&s;i&s;t upon your taking my place to-day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I cannot &s;uffer you to &s;it by a window with &s;uch a terrible cold."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip is very good, but in|deed I have not any cold at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my dear, I mu&s;t beg your pardon there; your eyes are quite blood-&s;hot; Mrs. Delvile, Lord Ernolf, are not her eyes quite red?&mdash;Lord, and &s;o I prote&s;t are her cheeks! now do pray look in the gla&s;s, I a&s;|&s;ure you you will hardly know your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="353">
Mrs. Delvile, who regarded her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, affected to under&s;tand La|dy Honoria's &s;peech literally, both to le&s;&s;en her apparent confu&s;ion, and the &s;u&s;picious &s;urmi&s;es of Lord Ernolf; &s;he therefore &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"you have indeed a bad cold, my love; but &s;hade your eyes with your hat, and after dinner you &s;hall bathe them in ro&s;e water, which will &s;oon take off the inflammation."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, perceiving her intention, for which &s;he &s;elt the utmo&s;t gratitude, no longer denied her cold, nor refu&s;ed the of|fer of Lady Honoria: who, delighting in mi&s;chief, whence-&s;oever it proceeded, pre|&s;ently added, <Q REND="inline">"This cold is a judgment upon you for leaving me alone all this morning; but I &s;uppo&s;e you cho&s;e a t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te with your favourite, without the intru|&s;ion of any third per&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>"Here every body &s;tared, and Cecilia very &s;eriou&s;ly declared &s;he had been quite alone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible you can &s;o forget your|&s;elf?"</Q> cried Lady Honoria; <Q REND="inline">had you not your dearly beloved with you?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who now comprehended that &s;he meant Fidel, coloured more deeply than ever, but attempted to laugh, and began eating her dinner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here &s;eems &s;ome matter of much in|tricacy,"</Q>
<PB N="355" REF="354">
cried Lord Ernolf, <Q REND="inline">"but, to me, wholly unintelligible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And to me al&s;o,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"but I am content to let it remain &s;o; for the my&s;teries of Lady Honoria are &s;o fre|quent, that they deaden curio&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear madam, that is very unnatural,"</Q> cried Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"for I am &s;ure you mu&s;t long to know who I mean."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> do, at lea&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Ernolf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, my lord, you mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s Beverley has two companions, and I am one, and Fidel is the other; but Fidel was with her all this morning, and &s;he would not admit me to the conference. I &s;up|po&s;e &s;he had &s;omething private to &s;ay to him of his ma&s;ter's journey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What rattle is this?"</Q> cried Mrs. Del|vile; <Q REND="inline">"Fidel is gone with my &s;on, is he not?"</Q> turning to the &s;ervants.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, Mr. Mortimer did not enquire for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's very &s;trange,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I ne|ver knew him quit home without him before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear ma'am, if he had taken him,"</Q> cri|ed Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"what could poor Mi&s;s Beverley have done? for &s;he has no friend here but him and me, and really he's &s;o much the greater favourite, that it is well
<PB N="356" REF="355">
if I do not poi&s;on him &s;ome day for very &s;pite."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia had no re&s;ource but in forcing a laugh, and Mrs. Delvile, who evidently felt for her, contrived &s;oon to change the &s;ubject: yet not before Lord Ernolf, with infinite chargrin, was certain by all that pa&s;&s;ed of the hopele&s;s &s;tate of affairs for his &s;on.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the day, and every hour of the two days following, Cecilia pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t comfortle&s;s con&s;traint, fearful of being a moment alone, le&s;t the heavine&s;s of her heart &s;hould &s;eek relief in tears, which con&s;olation, melancholy as it was, &s;he found too dangerous for indulgence: yet the gai|ety of Lady Honoria lo&s;t all power of en|tertainment, and even the kindne&s;s of Mrs. Delvile, now &s;he imputed it to compa&s;&s;ion, gave her more mortification than plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the third day, letters arrived from Bri&s;tol: but they brought with them no|thing of comfort, for though Mortimer wrote gaily, his father &s;ent word that his fever &s;eemed threatening to return.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile was now in the extreme&s;t anxiety; and the ta&s;k of Cecilia in appear|ing chearful and unconcerned, became more and more difficult to perform. Lord Ernolf's efforts to oblige her grew as hope|le&s;s
<PB N="357" REF="356">
to him&s;elf, as they were irk&s;ome to her; and Lady Honoria alone, of the whole hou&s;e, could either find or make the &s;malle&s;t diver&s;ion. But while Lord Derford remained, &s;he had &s;till an object for ridi|cule, and while Cecilia could colour and be confu&s;ed, &s;he had &s;till a &s;ubject for mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed a week, during which the news from Bri&s;tol being every day le&s;s and le&s;s plea&s;ant, Mrs. Delvile &s;hewed an ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire to make a journey thither her|&s;elf, and propo&s;ed, half laughing and half &s;eriou&s;ly, that the whole party &s;hould ac|company her.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria's time, however, was al|ready expired, and her father intended to &s;end for her in a few days.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, who knew that &s;uch a charge would occupy all her time, willingly deferred &s;etting out till her lady&s;hip &s;hould be gone, but wrote word to Bri&s;tol that &s;he &s;hould &s;hortly be there, attended by the two lords, who in&s;i&s;ted upon e&s;corting her.</P>
<P>Cecilia now was in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s; her &s;tay at the ca&s;tle &s;he knew kept Del|vile at a di&s;tance; to accompany his mother to Bri&s;tol, was forcing her&s;elf into his &s;ight, which equally from prudence and pride &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid; and even Mrs. Delvile
<PB N="358" REF="357">
evidently de&s;ired her ab&s;ence, &s;ince when|ever the journey was talked of, &s;he prefer|ably addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to any one el&s;e who was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>All &s;he could devi&s;e to relieve her&s;elf from a &s;ituation &s;o painful, was begging permi&s;&s;ion to make a vi&s;it without delay to her old friend Mrs. Charlton in Suffolk.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution taken, &s;he put it into immediate execution, and &s;eeking Mrs. Delvile, enquired if &s;he might venture to make a petition to her?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"but let it not be very di&s;agreeable, &s;ince I feel already that I can refu&s;e you nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have an old friend, ma'am,"</Q> &s;he then cried, &s;peaking fa&s;t, and in much ha&s;te to have done, <Q REND="inline">"who I have not for many months &s;een, and, as <HI>my</HI> health does not require a Bri&s;tol journey,&mdash;if you would honour me with mentioning my reque&s;t to Mr. Delvile, I think I might take the pre|&s;ent opportunity of making Mrs. Charlton a vi&s;it."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile looked at her &s;ome time without &s;peaking, and then, fervently em|bracing her, <Q REND="inline">"&s;weet Cecilia!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"yes, you are all that I thought you! good, wi&s;e, di&s;creet, tender, and noble at once!&mdash;how to part with you, indeed, I know not,&mdash;but you &s;hall do as you plea&s;e,
<PB N="359" REF="358">
for that I am &s;ure will be right, and therefore I will make no oppo&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia blu&s;hed and thanked her, yet &s;aw but too plainly that all the motives of her &s;cheme were clearly comprehended. She ha&s;tened, therefore, to write to Mrs. Charlton, and prepare for her reception.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, though with his u&s;ual for|mality, &s;ent his permi&s;&s;ion: and Mortimer at the &s;ame time, begged his mother would bring with her Fidel, whom he had un|luckily forgotten.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria, who was pre&s;ent when Mrs. Delvile mentioned this commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aid in a whi&s;per to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, don't let him go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you had a great deal better take him &s;lyly into Suffolk."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would as &s;oon,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"take with me the &s;ide-board of plate, for I &s;hould &s;carcely think it more a robbery."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I beg your pardon, I am &s;ure they might all take &s;uch a theft for an honour; and if I was going to Bri&s;tol, I would bid Mortimer &s;end him to you immediately. However, if you wi&s;h it, I will write to him. He's my cou&s;in, you know, &s;o there will be no great impropriety in it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked her for &s;o courteous an
<PB N="360" REF="359">
offer, but entreated that &s;he might by no means draw her into &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>She then made immediate preparations for her journey into Suffolk, which &s;he &s;aw gave equal &s;urprize and chargin to Lord Ernolf, upon who&s;e affairs Mrs. Delvile her&s;elf now de&s;ired to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Tell me, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"briefly and po&s;itively your opinion of Lord Derford?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think of him &s;o little, madam,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"that I cannot &s;ay of him much; he appears, however, to be inoffen&s;ive; but, indeed, were I never to &s;ee him again, he is one of tho&s;e I &s;hould forget I had ever &s;een at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is &s;o exactly the ca&s;e with my&s;elf al&s;o,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that to plead for him, I find utterly impo&s;&s;ible, though my Lord Ernolf has &s;trongly reque&s;ted me: but to pre&s;s &s;uch an alliance, I &s;hould think an indignity to your under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was much gratified by this &s;peech; but &s;he &s;oon after added, <Q REND="inline">"There is one rea&s;on, indeed, which would render &s;uch a connection de&s;irable, though that is only one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is it, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His title."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why &s;o? I am &s;ure I have no am|bition of that &s;ort."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="360">
<Q REND="inline">"No, my love,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"I mean not by way of gratifica|tion to <HI>your</HI> pride, but to <HI>his;</HI> &s;ince a title, by taking place of a family name, would obviate the <HI>only</HI> objection that <HI>any</HI> man could form to an alliance with Mi&s;s Be|verley."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who too well under&s;tood her, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh, and changed the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>One day was &s;ufficient for all the prepa|rations &s;he required, and, as &s;he meant to &s;et out very early the next morning, &s;he took leave of Lady Honoria, and the Lords Ernolf and Derford, when they &s;eparated for the night; but Mrs. Delvile followed her to her room.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed her concern at lo&s;ing her in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t flattering terms, yet &s;aid nothing of her coming back, nor of the length of her &s;tay; &s;he de&s;ired, how|ever, to hear from her frequently, and a&s;|&s;ured her that out of her own immediate family, there was nobody in the world &s;he &s;o tenderly valued.</P>
<P>She continued with her till it grew &s;o late that they were almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily part|ed: and then ri&s;ing, to be gone, <Q REND="inline">"See,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"with what reluctance I quit you! no intere&s;t but &s;o dear a one as that which calls me away, &s;hould induce
<PB N="362" REF="361">
me, with my own con&s;ent, to bear your ab&s;ence &s;carcely an hour: but the world is full of mortifications, and to endure, or to &s;ink under them, makes all the di|&s;tinction between the noble or the weak|minded. To <HI>you</HI> this may be &s;aid with &s;afety; to mo&s;t young women it would pa&s;s for a reflection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;mothering the emotions to which this &s;peech gave ri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"and if indeed you ho|nour me with an opinion &s;o flattering, I will endeavour, if it is po&s;&s;ibly in my power, not to forfeit it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, my love!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile warmly, <Q REND="inline">"if upon my opinion of <HI>you</HI> alone depended our re&s;idence with each other, when &s;hould we ever part, and how live a moment a&s;under? But what title have I to monopolize two &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings? the mother of Mortimer Delvile &s;hould at no|thing repine; the mother of Cecilia Beverley had alone equal rea&s;on to be proud."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are determined, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, forcing a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">that I <HI>&s;hall</HI> be worthy, by giving me the &s;weete&s;t of mo|tives, that of de&s;erving &s;uch prai&s;e."</Q> And then, in a faint voice, &s;he de&s;ired her re|&s;pects to Mr. Delvile, and added, <Q REND="inline">"you will find, I hope, every body at Bri&s;tol better than you expect."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="362">
<Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o;"</Q> returned &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"and that you too, will find your Mrs. Charlton well, happy, and good as you left her: but &s;uffer her not to drive <HI>me</HI> from your re|membrance, and never fancy that becau&s;e &s;he has known you longer, &s;he loves you more; my acquaintance with you, though &s;hort, has been critical, and &s;he mu&s;t hear from you a world of anecdotes, before &s;he can have rea&s;on to love you as much."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam,"</Q> cried Cecilia, tears &s;tart|ing into her eyes, <Q REND="inline">"let us part now!&mdash;where will be that &s;trength of mind you expect from me, if I li&s;ten to you any longer!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are right, my love,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince all tenderne&s;s enfeebles fortitude."</Q> Then affectionately embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"Adieu,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;weete&s;t Cecilia, amiable and mo&s;t excellent creature, adieu!&mdash;you carry with you my highe&s;t appro|bation, my love, my e&s;teem, my fonde&s;t wi&s;hes!&mdash;and &s;hall I&mdash;yes, generous girl!

<P>This la&s;t word &s;he &s;poke almo&s;t in a whi&s;per, again ki&s;&s;ed her, and ha&s;tened out of the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed and affected, gratified and depre&s;&s;ed, remained almo&s;t motionle&s;s, and could not, for a great length of time, either ring for her maid, or per&s;uade her|&s;elf

to go to re&s;t. She &s;aw throughout the whole behaviour of Mrs. Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by family pride, made her almo&s;t mi&s;erable to promote the very union &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;countenance; &s;he &s;aw, too, that it was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty &s;he pre&s;erved the &s;teadine&s;s of her oppo&s;ition, and that &s;he had a conflict per|petual with her&s;elf, to forbear openly ac|knowledging the contrariety of her wi&s;hes, and the perplexity of her di&s;tre&s;s; but chiefly &s;he was &s;truck with her expre&s;&s;ive u&s;e of the word gratitude. <Q REND="inline">"Wherefore &s;hould &s;he be grateful, thought Cecilia, what have I done, or had power to do? infinitely, indeed, is &s;he deceived, if &s;he &s;uppo&s;es that her &s;on has acted by my directions; my influence with him is no|thing, and he could not be more his own ma&s;ter, were he utterly indifferent to me.
