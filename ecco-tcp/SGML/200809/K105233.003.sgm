<P>ALL the re&s;earches of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas proved vain. Agnes was lo&s;t to him for ever. De&s;pair produced &s;o vio|lent an effect upon his con&s;titution, that the con&s;equence was a long and &s;evere ill|ne&s;s. This prevented him from vi&s;iting Elvira, as he had intended; and &s;he being ignorant of the cau&s;e of his neglect, it gave her no trifling unea&s;ine&s;s. His &s;i&s;ter's death
<PB N="2" REF="3">
had prevented Lorenzo from communicat|ing to his uncle his de&s;igns re&s;pecting An|tonia. The injunctions of her mother for|bade his pre&s;enting him&s;elf to her without the duke's con&s;ent; and as &s;he heard no more of him or his propo&s;als, Elvira con|jectured that he had either met with a bet|ter match, or had been commanded to give up all thoughts of her daughter. Every day made her more unea&s;y re&s;pecting An|tonia's fate; yet, while &s;he retained the ab|bot's protection, &s;he bore with fortitude the di&s;appointment of her hopes with regard to Lorenzo and the marquis. That re&s;ource now failed her. She was convinced that Am|bro&s;io had meditated her daughter's ruin; and when &s;he reflected that her death would leave Antonia friendle&s;s and unprotected in a world &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o perfidious and de|praved, her heart &s;welled with the bitter|ne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion. At &s;uch times &s;he would &s;it for hours gazing upon the lovely girl, and &s;eeming to li&s;ten to her innocent prattle, while in reality her thoughts dwelt
<PB N="3" REF="4">
upon the &s;orrows into which a moment would &s;uffice to plunge her. Then &s;he would cla&s;p her in her arms &s;uddenly, lean her head upon her daughter's bo&s;om, and bedew it with her tears.</P>
<P>An event was in preparation, which, had &s;he known it, would have relieved her from her inquietude. Lorenzo now waited only for a favourable opportunity to inform the duke of his intended marriage: however, a circum&s;tance which occurred at this period obliged him to delay his explanation for a few days longer.</P>
<P>Don Raymond's malady &s;eemed to gain ground. Lorenzo was con&s;tantly at his bed-&s;ide, and treated him with a tenderne&s;s truly fraternal. Both the cau&s;e and effects of the di&s;order were highly afflicting to the brother of Agnes; yet Theodore's grief was &s;carcely le&s;s &s;incere. That amiable boy quitted not his ma&s;ter for a moment, and put every means in practice to con&s;ole and alleviate his &s;ufferings. The marquis had conceived &s;o rooted an affection for his de|cea&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="5">
mi&s;tre&s;s, that it was evident to all that he never could &s;urvive her lo&s;s. No|thing could have prevented him from &s;ink|ing under his grief, but the per&s;ua&s;ion of her being &s;till alive, and in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Though convinced of its fal&s;ehood, his attendants encouraged him in a belief which formed his only comfort. He was a&s;&s;ured daily, that fre&s;h perqui&s;itions were making re&s;pecting the fate of Agnes; &s;to|ries were invented recounting the various attempts made to get admittance into the convent; and circum&s;tances were related, which, though they did not promi&s;e her ab|&s;olute recovery, at lea&s;t were &s;ufficient to keep his hopes alive. The marquis con|&s;tantly fell into the mo&s;t terrible acce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, when informed of the failure of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed attempts. Still he would not credit that the &s;ucceeding ones would have the &s;ame fate, but flattered him&s;elf that the next would prove more fortu|nate.</P>
<P>Theodore was the only one who exerted
<PB N="5" REF="6">
him&s;elf to realize his ma&s;ter's chimeras. He was eternally bu&s;ied in planning &s;chemes for entering the convent, or at lea&s;t of ob|taining from the nuns &s;ome intelligence of Agnes. To execute the&s;e &s;chemes was the only inducement which could prevail on him to quit Don Raymond. He became a very Proteus, changing his &s;hape every day; but all his metamorpho&s;es were to very little purpo&s;e. He regularly returned to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas without any in|telligence to confirm his ma&s;ter's hopes. One day he took it into his head to di&s;|gui&s;e him&s;elf as a beggar; he put a patch over his left eye, took his guitar in hand, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the gate of the con|vent.</P>
<P>"If Agnes is really confined in the con|vent," thought he, "and hears my voice, &s;he will recollect it, and po&s;&s;ibly may find means to let me know that &s;he is here."</P>
<P>With this idea he mingled with a crowd of beggars who a&s;&s;embled daily at the gate of St. Clare to receive &s;oup, which the nuns
<PB N="6" REF="7">
were accu&s;tomed to di&s;tribute at twelve o'clock. All were provided with jugs or bowls to carry it away; but as Theodore had no uten&s;il of this kind, he begged leave to eat his portion at the convent door. This was granted without difficulty. His &s;weet voice, and, in &s;pite of his patched eye, his engaging countenance, won the heart of the good old portere&s;s, who, aided by a lay-&s;i&s;ter, was bu&s;ied in &s;erving to each his me&s;s. Theodore was bid to &s;tay till the others &s;hould depart, and promi&s;ed that his reque&s;t &s;hould then be granted. The youth de&s;ired no better, &s;ince it was not to eat &s;oup that he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the con|vent. He thanked the portere&s;s for her permi&s;&s;ion, retired from the door, and, &s;eating him&s;elf upon a large &s;tone, amu&s;ed him&s;elf in tuning his guitar while the beg|gars were &s;erved.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the crowd was gone, Theodore was beckoned to the gate, and de&s;ired to come in. He obeyed with infinite readine&s;s, but affected great re&s;pect at pa&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
hallowed thre&s;hold, and to be much daunted by the pre&s;ence of the reverend ladies. His feigned timidity flattered the vanity of the nuns, who endeavoured to re-a&s;&s;ure him. The portere&s;s took him into her own little parlour: in the mean while, the lay-&s;i&s;ter went to the kitchen, and &s;oon re|turned with a double portion of &s;oup of better quality than what was given to the beggars. His ho&s;te&s;s added &s;ome fruits and confections from her own private &s;tore, and both encouraged the youth to dine heartily. To all the&s;e attentions he re|plied with much &s;eeming gratitude, and abundance of ble&s;&s;ings upon his benefac|tre&s;&s;es. While he ate, the nuns admired the delicacy of his features, the beauty of his hair, and the &s;weetne&s;s and grace which accompanied all his actions. They lament|ed to each other in whi&s;pers, that &s;o charm|ing a youth &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the &s;e|ductions of the world, and agreed that he would be a worthy pillar of the catholic church. They concluded their conference
<PB N="8" REF="9">
by re&s;olving, that heaven would be ren|dered a real &s;ervice, if they entreated the priore&s;s to intercede with Ambro&s;io for the beggar's admi&s;&s;ion into the order of capuchins.</P>
<P>This being determined, the portere&s;s, who was a per&s;on of great influence in the convent, po&s;ted away in all ha&s;te to the domina's cell. Here &s;he made &s;o flaming a narrative of Theodore's merits, that the old lady grew curious to &s;ee him. Accordingly the portere&s;s was commi&s;&s;ioned to convey him to the parlour-grate. In the interim, the &s;uppo&s;ed beggar was &s;ifting the lay-&s;i&s;ter with re&s;pect to the fate of Agnes: her evidence only corroborated the domina's a&s;&s;ertions. She &s;aid, that Agnes had been taken ill on returning from confe&s;&s;ion&punc; had never quitted her bed from that moment, and that &s;he had her&s;elf been pre&s;ent at the funeral. She even atte&s;ted having &s;een her dead body, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted with her own hands in adju&s;ting it upon the bier. This account di&s;couraged Theodore; yet, as he had pu&s;h|ed
<PB N="9" REF="10">
the adventure &s;o far, he re&s;olved to wit|ne&s;s its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The portere&s;s now returned, and ordered him to follow her. He obeyed, and was conducted into the parlour, where the lady priore&s;s was already po&s;ted at the grate. The nuns &s;urrounded her, who all flocked with eagerne&s;s to a &s;cene which promi&s;ed &s;ome diver&s;ion. Theodore &s;aluted them with profound re&s;pect, and his pre&s;ence had the power to &s;mooth for a moment even the &s;tern brow of the &s;uperior. She a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions re&s;pecting his pa|rents, his religion, and what had reduced him to a &s;tate of beggary. To the&s;e de|mands his an&s;wers were perfectly &s;atisfac|tory and perfectly fal&s;e. He was then a&s;ked his opinion of a mona&s;tic life. He replied in terms of high e&s;timation and re&s;pect for it. Upon this the priore&s;s told him, that his obtaining an entrance into a religious order was not impo&s;&s;ible; that her recom+mendation would not permit his poverty to be an ob&s;tacle; and that, if &s;he found him
<PB N="10" REF="11">
de&s;erving it, he might depend in future upon her protection. Theodore a&s;&s;ured her, that to merit her favour would be his highe&s;t ambition; and having ordered him to return next day, when &s;he would talk with him further, the domina quitted the parlour.</P>
<P>The nuns, whom re&s;pect for the &s;uperior had till then kept &s;ilent, now crowded all together to the grate, and a&s;&s;ailed the youth with a multitude of que&s;tions. He had al|ready examined each with attention. Alas! Agnes was not among&s;t them. The nuns heaped que&s;tion upon que&s;tion &s;o thickly, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him to re|ply. One a&s;ked where he was born, &s;ince his accent declared him to be a foreigner: another wanted to know why he wore a patch upon his left eye: &s;i&s;ter Helena en|quired whether he had not a &s;i&s;ter like him, becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould like &s;uch a companion: and &s;i&s;ter Rachael was fully per&s;uaded that the brother would be the plea&s;anter com|panion of the two. Theodore amu&s;ed him|&s;elf
<PB N="11" REF="12">
with relating to the credulous nuns, for truths, all the &s;trange &s;tories which his ima|gination could invent. He related to them his &s;uppo&s;ed adventures, and penetrated every auditor with a&s;toni&s;hment, while he talked of giants, &s;avages, &s;hipwrecks, and i&s;lands inhabited
<Q><L>By anthropophagi, and men who&s;e heads</L>
<L>Do grow beneath their &s;houlders,</L></Q>
with many other circum&s;tances to the full as remarkable. He &s;aid that he was born in Teria Incognita, was educated at an Hottentot univer&s;ity, and had pa&s;&s;ed two years among the Americans of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>"For what regards the lo&s;s of my eye," &s;aid he, "it was a ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon me for di&s;re&s;pect to the Virgin, when I made my &s;econd pilgrimage to Loretto. I &s;tood near the altar in the miraculous chapel the monks were proceeding to array the &s;tatue in her be&s;t apparel. The pilgrims were ordered to clo&s;e their eyes during this cere|mony; but though by nature extremely re|ligious, curio&s;ity was too powerful. At the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
moment . . . . . I &s;hall penetrate you with horror, reverend ladies, when I reveal my crime! . . . . At the moment that the monks were changing her &s;hift, I ventured to open my left eye, and gave a little peep towards the &s;tatue. That look was my la&s;t! The glory which &s;urrounded the Virgin was too great to be &s;upported. I ha&s;tily &s;hut my &s;acrilegious eye, and never have been able to unclo&s;e it &s;ince!"</P>
<P>At the relation of this miracle the nuns all cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and promi&s;ed to in|tercede with the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin for the reco|very of his &s;ight. They expre&s;&s;ed their wonder at the extent of his travels, and at the &s;trange adventures which he had met with at &s;o early an age. They now remark|ed his guitar, and enquired whether he was an adept in mu&s;ic. He replied with mo|de&s;ty, that it was not for him to decide upon his talents, but reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to appeal to them as judges. This was granted without difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">"But at lea&s;t," &s;aid the old portere&s;s, "take care not to &s;ing any thing profane."</P>
<P>"You may depend upon my di&s;cretion," replied Theodore; "you &s;hall hear how dan|gerous it is for young women to abandon them&s;elves to their pa&s;&s;ions, illu&s;trated by the adventure of a dam&s;el, who fell &s;ud|denly in love with an unknown knight."</P>
<P>"But is the adventure true?" enquired the portere&s;s.</P>
<P>"Every word of it. It happened in Denmark; and the heroine was thought &s;o beautiful, that &s;he was known by no other name but that of "the lovely maid."</P>
<P>"In Denmark, &s;ay you?" mumbled an old nun: "Are not the people all blacks in Denmark?"</P>
<P>"By no means, reverend lady; they are of a delicate pea-green, with flame-coloured hair and whi&s;kers."</P>
<P>"Mother of God! Pea-green?" ex|claimed &s;i&s;ter Helena: "Oh! 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid the portere&s;s, with a
<PB N="14" REF="15">
look of contempt and exultation: "Not at all: when I was a young woman, I remem|ber &s;eeing &s;everal of them my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Theodore now put his in&s;trument in pro|per order. He had read the &s;tory of a king of England, who&s;e pri&s;on was di&s;covered by a min&s;trel; and he hoped that the &s;ame &s;cheme would enable him to di&s;cover Ag|nes, &s;hould &s;he be in the convent. He cho&s;e a ballad, which &s;he had taught him her&s;elf in the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg: &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly catch the &s;ound, and he hoped to hear her replying to &s;ome of the &s;tanzas. His guitar was now in tune, and he prepared to &s;trike it.</P>
<P>"But, before I begin," &s;aid he, "it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, ladies, that this &s;ame Denmark is terribly infe&s;ted by &s;or|cerers, witches, and evil &s;pirits. Every element po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its appropriate daemons. The woods are haunted by a malignant power, called "The Erl, or Oak-King:" he it is who blights the trees, &s;poils the harve&s;t, and commands the imps and gob|lins.
<PB N="15" REF="16">
He appears in the form of an old man of maje&s;tic figure, with a golden crown, and long white beard. His principal amu&s;ement is to entice young children from their parents; and as &s;oon as he gets them into his cave, he tears them into a thou&s;and pieces. The rivers are governed by ano|ther fiend, called "The Water-King:" his province is to agitate the deep, occa&s;ion &s;hipwrecks, and drag the drowning &s;ailors beneath the waves. He wears the appear|ance of a warrior, and employs him&s;elf in luring young virgins into his &s;nare: what he does with them, when he catches them in the water, reverend ladies, I leave for you to imagine. "The Fire-King" &s;eems to be a man all formed of flames: he rai&s;es the meteors and wandering lights, which beguile travellers into ponds and mar&s;hes, and he directs the lightning where it may do mo&s;t mi&s;chief. The la&s;t of the&s;e ele|mentary daemons is called "The Cloud-King:" his figure is that of a beautiful youth, and he is di&s;tingui&s;hed by two large
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;able wings: though his out&s;ide is &s;o en|chanting, he is not a bit better di&s;po&s;ed than the others. He is continually employed in rai&s;ing &s;torms, tearing up fore&s;ts by the roots, and blowing ca&s;tles and convents about the ears of their inhabitants. The fir&s;t has a daughter, who is queen of the elves and fairies: the &s;econd has a mother, who is a powerful enchantre&s;s. Neither of the&s;e ladies are worth more than the gen|tlemen. I do not remember to have heard any family a&s;&s;igned to the two other dae|mons, but at pre&s;ent I have no bu&s;ine&s;s with any of them except the fiend of the waters. He is the hero of my ballad; but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, before I began, to give you &s;ome account of his proceed|ings."</P>
<P>Theodore then played a &s;hort &s;ymphony; after which, &s;tretching his voice to its ut|mo&s;t extent, to facilitate its reaching the ear of Agnes, he &s;ung the following &s;tanzas:

<P>The youth cea&s;ed to &s;ing. The nuns were delighted with the &s;weetne&s;s of his voice, and ma&s;terly manner of touching the in&s;trument; but however acceptable this applau&s;e would have been at any other time, at pre&s;ent it was in&s;ipid to Theodore. His artifice had not &s;ucceeded. He pau&s;ed in vain between the &s;tanzas; no voice re|plied to his, and he abandoned the hope of equalling Blondel.</P>
<P>The convent-bell now warned the nuns that it was time to a&s;&s;emble in the refecto|ry. They were obliged to quit the grate:
<PB N="21" REF="22">
they thanked the youth for the entertain|ment which his mu&s;ic had afforded them, and charged him to return the next day. This he promi&s;ed. The nuns, to give him the greater inclination to keep his word, told him that he might always depend upon the convent for his meals, and each of them made him &s;ome little pre&s;ent. One gave him a box of &s;weetmeats; another, an ag|nus dei; &s;ome brought reliques of &s;aints, waxen images, and con&s;ecrated cro&s;&s;es; and others pre&s;ented him with pieces of tho&s;e works in which the religious excel, &s;uch as embroidery, artificial flowers, lace, and needle-work. All the&s;e he was advi&s;ed to &s;ell, in order to put him&s;elf into better ca&s;e; and he was a&s;&s;ured that it would be ea&s;y to di&s;po&s;e of them, &s;ince the Spaniards hold the performances of the nuns in high e&s;timation. Having received the&s;e gifts with &s;eeming re&s;pect and gratitude, he re|marked, that, having no ba&s;ket, he knew not how to convey them away. Several of the nuns were ha&s;tening in &s;earch of one,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
when they were &s;topped by the return of an elderly woman, whom Theodore had not till then ob&s;erved. Her mild countenance and re&s;pectable air prejudiced him imme|diately in her favour.</P>
<P>"Hah!" &s;aid the portere&s;s, "here comes the mother St. Ur&s;ula with a ba&s;ket."</P>
<P>The nun approached the grate, and pre|&s;ented the ba&s;ket to Theodore: it was of willow, lined with blue &s;atin, and upon the four &s;ides were painted &s;cenes from the le|gend of St. Genevieve.</P>
<P>"Here is my gift," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he gave it into his hand: "Good youth, de&s;pi&s;e it not. Though its value &s;eems in&s;ignificant, it has many hidden virtues."</P>
<P>She accompanied the&s;e words with an expre&s;&s;ive look. It was not lo&s;t upon The|odore. In receiving the pre&s;ent, he drew as near the grate as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Agnes!" &s;he whi&s;pered in a voice &s;carcely intelligible.</P>
<P>Theodore, however, caught the &s;ound. He concluded that &s;ome my&s;tery was con|cealed
<PB N="23" REF="24">
in the ba&s;ket, and his heart beat with impatience and joy. At this moment the domina returned. Her air was gloomy and frowning, and &s;he looked if po&s;&s;ible more &s;tern than ever.</P>
<P>"Mother St. Ur&s;ula, I would &s;peak with you in private."</P>
<P>The nun changed colour, and was evi|dently di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>"With me?" &s;he replied in a faltering voice.</P>
<P>The domina motioned that &s;he mu&s;t follow her, and retired. The mother St. Ur&s;ula obeyed her. Soon after, the refec|tory bell ringing a &s;econd time, the nuns quitted the grate, and Theodore was left at liberty to carry off his prize. Delighted that at length he had obtained &s;ome intelli|gence for the marquis, he flew rather than ran till he reached the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas. In a few minutes he &s;tood by his ma&s;ter's bed with the ba&s;ket in his hand. Lorenzo was in the chamber, endeavouring to recon|cile
<PB N="24" REF="25">
his friend to a misfortune which he felt him&s;elf but too &s;everely. Theodore related his adventure, and the hopes which had been created by the mother St. Ur|&s;ula's gift. The marquis &s;tarted from his pillow. That fire which &s;ince the death of Agnes had been extingui&s;hed, now re|vived in his bo&s;om, and his eyes &s;parkled with the eagerne&s;s of expectation. The emotions which Lorenzo's countenance be|trayed were &s;carcely weaker, and he waited with inexpre&s;&s;ible impatience for the &s;olu|tion of this my&s;tery. Raymond caught the ba&s;ket from the hands of his page: he emp|tied the contents upon the bed, and ex|amined them with minute attention. He hoped that a letter would be found at the bottom. Nothing of the kind appeared. The &s;earch was re&s;umed, and &s;till with no better &s;ucce&s;s. At length Don Raymond ob&s;erved, that one corner of the blue &s;atin lining was unripped: he tore it open ha&s;tily, and drew forth a &s;mall &s;crap of paper, nei|ther
<PB N="25" REF="26">
folded nor &s;ealed. It was addre&s;&s;ed to the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, and the con|tents were as follow:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Having recogni&s;ed your page, I ven|ture to &s;end the&s;e few lines. Procure an order from the cardinal-duke for &s;eizing my per&s;on, and that of the domina; but let it not be executed till Friday at mid|night. It is the fe&s;tival of St. Clare: there will be a proce&s;&s;ion of nuns by torch-light, and I &s;hall be among them. Beware, not to let your intention be known. Should a &s;yllable be dropped to excite the domina's &s;u&s;picions, you will never hear of me more. Be cautious, if you prize the memory of Agnes, and wi&s;h to puni&s;h her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins&punc; I have that to tell, will freeze your blood with horror.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>No &s;ooner had the marquis read the note, than he fell back upon his pillow deprived of &s;en&s;e or motion. The hope failed him which till now had &s;upported his exi&s;tence; and
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the&s;e lines convinced him but too po&s;itively that Agnes was indeed no more. Lorenzo felt this circum&s;tance le&s;s forcibly, &s;ince it had always been his idea that his &s;i&s;ter had peri&s;hed by unfair means. When he found by the mother ST. Ur&s;ula's letter how true were his &s;u&s;picions, the confirmation excited no other &s;entiment in his bo&s;om than a wi&s;h to puni&s;h the murderers as they de&s;erved. It was no ea&s;y ta&s;k to recall the marquis to him&s;elf. As &s;oon as he recovered his &s;peech, he broke out into execrations again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his beloved, and vowed to take upon them a &s;ignal vengeance. He con|tinued to rave and torment him&s;elf with impotent pa&s;&s;ion, till his con&s;titution, en|feebled by grief and illne&s;s, could &s;upport it&s;elf no longer, and relap&s;ed into in&s;en&s;i|bility. His melancholy &s;ituation &s;incerely affected Lorenzo, who would willingly have remained in the apartment of his friend; but other cares now demanded his pre&s;ence. It was nece&s;&s;ary to procure the order for &s;eizing the priore&s;s of St. Clare.
<PB N="27" REF="28">
For this purpo&s;e, having committed Ray|mond to the care of the be&s;t phy&s;icians in Madrid, he quitted the hotel de las Ci&s;ter|nas, and bent his cour&s;e towards the palace of the cardinal-duke.</P>
<P>His di&s;appointment was exce&s;&s;ive, when he found that affairs of &s;tate had obliged the cardinal to &s;et out for a di&s;tant pro|vince. It wanted but five days to Friday: yet, by travelling day and night, he hoped to return in time for the pilgrimage of St. Clare. In this he &s;ucceeded. He found the cardinal-duke, and repre&s;ented to him the &s;uppo&s;ed culpability of the priore&s;s, as al&s;o the violent effects which it had pro|duced upon Don Raymond. He could have u&s;ed no argument &s;o forcible as this la&s;t. Of all his nephews the marquis was the only one to whom the cardinal-duke was &s;incere|ly attached: he perfectly doted upon him, and the priore&s;s could have committed no greater crime in his eyes, than to have en|dangered the life of the marquis. Con&s;e|quently, he granted the order of arre&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="29">
without difficulty. He al&s;o gave Lorenzo a letter to a principal officer of the Inqui|&s;ition, de&s;iring him to &s;ee his mandate exe|cuted. Furni&s;hed with the&s;e papers, Me|dina ha&s;tened back to Madrid, which he reached on the Friday a few hours before dark. He found the marquis &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, but &s;o weak and exhau&s;ted, that without great exertion he could neither &s;peak nor move. Having pa&s;&s;ed an hour by his bed-&s;ide, Lorenzo left him to commu|nicate his de&s;ign to his uncle, as al&s;o to give Don Ramirez de Mello the cardinal's letter. The fir&s;t was petrified with horror, when he learned the fate of his unhappy niece. He encouraged Lorenzo to puni&s;h her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and engaged to accompany him at night to St. Clare's convent. Don Ramirez pro|mi&s;ed his firme&s;t &s;upport, and &s;elected a band of tru&s;ty archers to prevent oppo&s;ition on the part of the populace.</P>
<P>But while Lorenzo was anxious to un|ma&s;k one religious hypocrite, he was un|con&s;cious of the &s;orrows prepared for him
<PB N="29" REF="30">
by another. Aided by Matilda's infernal agents, Ambro&s;io had re&s;olved upon the innocent Antonia's ruin. The moment de&s;tined to be &s;o fatal to her arrived. She had taken leave of her mother for the night. As &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her, &s;he felt an unu&s;ual de|&s;pondency infu&s;e it&s;elf into her bo&s;om. She left her, and returned to her in&s;tantly, threw her&s;elf into her maternal arms, and bathed her cheek with tears. She felt unea&s;y at quitting her, and a &s;ecret pre&s;entiment a&s;|&s;ured her that never mu&s;t they meet again. Elvira ob&s;erved, and tried to laugh her out of this childi&s;h prejudice. She chid her mildly for encouraging &s;uch ungrounded &s;adne&s;s, and warned her how dangerous it was to encourage &s;uch ideas.</P>
<P>To all her remon&s;trances &s;he received no other an&s;wer than&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mother! Dear mother! Oh! would to God it were morning!"</P>
<P>Elvira, who&s;e inquietude re&s;pecting her daughter was a great ob&s;tacle to her perfect re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, was &s;till labouring under
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the effects of her late &s;evere illne&s;s. She was this evening more than u&s;ually indi&s;|po&s;ed, and retired to bed before her accu&s;|tomed hour. Antonia withdrew from her mother's chamber with regret, and, till the door clo&s;ed, kept her eyes fixed upon her with melancholy expre&s;&s;ion. She retired to her own apartment: her heart was filled with bitterne&s;s. It &s;eemed to her that all her pro&s;pects were bla&s;ted, and the world contained nothing for which it was worth exi&s;ting; She &s;ank into a chair, reclined her head upon her arm, and gazed upon the floor with a vacant &s;tare, while the mo&s;t gloomy images floated before her fancy. She was &s;till in this &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, when &s;he was di&s;turbed by hearing a &s;train of &s;oft mu&s;ic breathed beneath her window. She ro&s;e, drew near the ca&s;ement, and opened it to hear it more di&s;tinctly. Having thrown her veil over her face, &s;he ventured to look out. By the light of the moon &s;he perceived &s;everal men below with guitars and lutes in their hands; and at a little di&s;tance from
<PB N="31" REF="32">
them &s;tood another wrapped in his cloak, who&s;e &s;tature and appearance bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to Lorenzo's. She was not deceived in this conjecture. It was indeed Lorenzo him&s;elf, who, bound by his word not to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to Antonia without his uncle's con&s;ent, endeavoured, by occa|&s;ional &s;erenades, to convince his mi&s;tre&s;s that his attachment &s;till exi&s;ted. His &s;tra|tagem had not the de&s;ired effect. Antonia was far from &s;uppo&s;ing that this nightly mu&s;ic was intended as a compliment to her. She was too mode&s;t to think her&s;elf worthy &s;uch attentions; and concluding them to be addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ome neighbouring lady, &s;he grieved to find that they were offered by Lorenzo.</P>
<P>The air which was played, was plaintive and melodious. It accorded with the &s;tate of Antonia's mind, and &s;he li&s;tened with plea&s;ure. After a &s;ymphony of &s;ome length, it was &s;ucceeded by the &s;ound of voices, and Antonia di&s;tingui&s;hed the following words:

<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed: the performers di&s;|per&s;ed, and &s;ilence prevailed through the &s;treet. Antonia quitted the window with regret. She, as u&s;ual, recommended her &s;elf to the protection of St. Ro&s;olia, &s;aid her accu&s;tomed prayers, and retired to bed. Sleep was not long ab&s;ent, and his pre&s;ence relieved her from her terrors and inquie|tude.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t two o'clock before the lu&s;tful monk ventured to bend his &s;teps towards Antonia's dwelling. It has been already mentioned, that the abbey was at no great di&s;tance from the &s;trada di San Iago. He reached the hou&s;e unob&s;erved. Here he &s;topped, and he&s;itated for a mo|ment. He reflected on the enormity of the crime, the con&s;equences of a di&s;covery, and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
the probability, after what had pa&s;&s;ed, of Elvira's &s;u&s;pecting him to be her daughter's ravi&s;her. On the other hand it was &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that &s;he could do no more than &s;u&s;|pect; that no proofs of his guilt could be produced; that it would &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible for the rape to have been committed without Antonia's knowing when, where, or by whom; and finally, he believed that his &s;ame was too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed to be &s;haken by the un&s;upported accu&s;ations of two un|known women. This latter argument was perfectly fal&s;e. He knew not how uncer|tain is the air of popular applau&s;e, and that a moment &s;uffices to make him to-day the dete&s;tation of the world, who ye&s;terday was its idol. The re&s;ult of the monk's delibe|rations was, that he &s;hould proceed in his enterpri&s;e. He a&s;cended the &s;teps leading to the hou&s;e. No &s;ooner did he touch the door with the &s;ilver myrtle, than it flew open, and pre&s;ented him with a free pa&s;&s;age. He entered, and the door clo&s;ed after him of its own accord.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">Guided by the moon-beams, he pro|ceeded up the &s;tair-ca&s;e with &s;low and cau|tious &s;teps. He looked round him every moment with apprehen&s;ion and anxiety. He &s;aw a &s;py in every &s;hadow, and heard a voice in every murmur of the night-breeze. Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the guilty bu&s;ine&s;s on which he was employed appalled his heart, and rendered it more timid than a woman's. Yet &s;till he proceeded. He reached the door of Antonia's chamber. He &s;topped, and li&s;tened. All was hu&s;hed within. The total &s;ilence per&s;uaded him that his intended victim was retired to re&s;t, and he ventured to lift up the latch. The door was fa&s;tened, and re&s;i&s;ted his efforts. But no &s;ooner was it touched by the tali&s;|man, than the bolt flew back. The ra|vi&s;her &s;tepped on, and found him&s;elf in the chamber, where &s;lept the innocent girl, un|con&s;cious how dangerous a vi&s;itor was draw|ing near her couch. The door clo&s;ed after him, and the bolt &s;hot again into its fa&s;ten|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">Ambro&s;io advanced with precaution. He took care that not a board &s;hould creak un|der his foot, and held in his breath as he approached the bed. His fir&s;t attention was to perform the magic ceremony, as Matilda had charged him: he breathed thrice upon the &s;ilver myrtle, pronounced over it Antonia's name, and laid it upon her pillow&punc; The effects which it had al|ready produced permitted not his doubting its &s;ucce&s;s in prolonging the &s;lumbers of his devoted mi&s;tre&s;s. No &s;ooner was the inchantment performed, than he con&s;idered her to be ab&s;olutely in his power, and his eyes fla&s;hed with lu&s;t and impatience. He now ventured to ca&s;t a glance upon the &s;leeping beauty. A &s;ingle lamp, burning before the &s;tatue of St. Ro&s;olia, &s;hed a faint light through the room, and permitted him to examine all the charms of the lovely object before him. The heat of the wea|ther had obliged her to throw off part of the bed-clothes. Tho&s;e which &s;till covered her Ambro&s;io's in&s;olent hand ha&s;tened to
<PB N="37" REF="38">
remove. She lay with her cheek reclining upon one ivory arm: the other re&s;ted on the &s;ide of the bed with graceful indolence. A few tre&s;&s;es of her hair had e&s;caped from beneath the mu&s;lin which confined the re&s;t, and fell carele&s;sly over her bo&s;om, as it heaved with &s;low and regular &s;u&s;piration. The warm air had &s;pread her check with higher colour than u&s;ual. A &s;mile inex|pre&s;&s;ibly &s;weet played round her ripe and coral lips, from which every now and then e&s;caped a gentle &s;igh, or an half-pronounced &s;entence. An air of enchanting innocence and candour pervaded her whole form; and there was a &s;ort of mode&s;ty in her very nakedne&s;s, which added fre&s;h &s;tings to the de&s;ires of the lu&s;tful monk.</P>
<P>He remained for &s;ome moments devour|ing tho&s;e charms with his eyes, which &s;oon were to be &s;ubjected to his ill-regulated pa&s;&s;ions. Her mouth half-opened &s;eemed to &s;olicit a ki&s;s: he bent over her: he joined his lips to hers, and drew in the fragrance of her breath with rapture. This momen|tary
<PB N="38" REF="39">
plea&s;ure increa&s;ed his longing for &s;till greater. His de&s;ires were rai&s;ed to that frantic height by which brutes are agitated. He re&s;olved not to delay for one in&s;tant longer the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes, and ha&s;tily proceeded to tear off tho&s;e gar|ments which impeded the gratification of his lu&s;t.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" exclaimed a voice behind him: "Am I not deceived? Is not this an illu&s;ion?"</P>
<P>Terror, confu&s;ion, and di&s;appointment accompanied the&s;e words, as they &s;truck Ambro&s;io's hearing. He &s;tarted, and turned towards it. Elvira &s;tood at the door of the chamber, and regarded the monk with looks of &s;urpri&s;e and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>A frightful dream had repre&s;ented to her Antonia on the verge of a precipice. She &s;aw her trembling on the brink: every mo|ment &s;eemed to threaten her fall, and &s;he heard her exclaim with &s;hrieks, "Save me, mother! &s;ave me!&mdash;Yet a moment, and it will be too late." Elvira woke in terror.
<PB N="39" REF="40">
The vi&s;ion had made too &s;trong an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, to permit her re&s;t|ing till a&s;&s;ured of her daughter's &s;afety. She ha&s;tily &s;tarted from her bed, threw on a loo&s;e night-gown, and, pa&s;&s;ing through the clo&s;et in which &s;lept the waiting-woman, reached Antonia's chamber ju&s;t in time to re&s;cue her from the gra&s;p of the ravi&s;her.</P>
<P>His &s;hame and her amazement &s;eemed to have petrified into &s;tatues both Elvira and the monk. They remained gazing upon each other in &s;ilence. The lady was the fir&s;t to recover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"It is no dream," &s;he cried: "it is really Ambro&s;io, who &s;tands before me. It is the man whom Madrid e&s;teems a &s;aint, that I find at this late hour near the couch of my unhappy child. Mon&s;ter of hypocri&s;y! I already &s;u&s;pected your de&s;igns, but forbore your accu&s;ation in pity to human frailty. Silence would now be criminal. The whole city &s;hall be informed of your incontinence. I will unma&s;k you, villain, and convince the
<PB N="40" REF="41">
church what a viper &s;he cheri&s;hes in her bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Pale and confu&s;ed, the baffled culprit &s;tood trembling before her. He would fain have extenuated his offence, but could find no apology for his conduct. He could pro|duce nothing but broken &s;entences, and ex|cu&s;es which contradicted each other. Elvira was too ju&s;tly incen&s;ed to grant the pardon which he reque&s;ted. She prote&s;ted that &s;he would rai&s;e the neighbourhood, and make him an example to all future hypocrites. Then ha&s;tening to the bed, &s;he called to Antonia to wake; and finding that her voice had no effect, &s;he took her arm, and rai&s;ed her forcibly from the pillow. The charm operated too powerfully. Antonia remained in&s;en&s;ible; and, on being relea&s;ed by her mother, &s;ank back upon the pillow.</P>
<P>"This &s;lumber cannot be natural," cried the amazed Elvira, who&s;e indignation in|crea&s;ed with every moment: "&s;ome my&s;tery is concealed in it. But tremble, hypocrite! All your villany &s;hall &s;oon be unravelled.
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Help! help!" &s;he exclaimed aloud: "Within there! Flora! Flora!"</P>
<P>"Hear me for one moment, lady!" cried the monk, re&s;tored to him&s;elf by the urgency of the danger: "by all that is &s;a|cred and holy, I &s;wear that your daughter's honour is &s;till unviolated. Forgive my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion! Spare me the &s;hame of a di&s;|covery, and permit me to regain the abbey undi&s;turbed. Grant me this reque&s;t in mercy! I promi&s;e not only that Antonia &s;hall be &s;ecure from me in future, but that the re&s;t of my life &s;hall prove&mdash;"</P>
<P>Elvira interrupted him abruptly.</P>
<P>"Antonia &s;ecure from you? <HI>I</HI> will &s;e|cure her. You &s;hall betray no longer the confidence of parents. Your iniquity &s;hall be unveiled to the public eye. All Madrid &s;hall &s;hudder at your perfidy, your hypo|cri&s;y, and incontinence. What ho! there! Flora! Flora! I &s;ay."</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke thus, the remembrance of Agnes &s;truck upon his mind. Thus had &s;he &s;ued to him for mercy, and thus had

he refu&s;ed her prayer! It was now his turn to &s;uffer, and he could not but acknowledge that his puni&s;hment was ju&s;t. In the mean while Elvira continued to call Flora to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but her voice was &s;o choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, that the &s;ervant, who was bu|ried in profound &s;lumber, was in&s;en&s;ible to all her cries: Elvira dared not go towards the clo&s;et in which Flora &s;lept, le&s;t the monk &s;hould take that opportunity to e&s;cape. Such indeed was his intention: he tru&s;ted that, could he reach the abbey unob&s;erved by any other than Elvira, her &s;ingle te&s;timony would not &s;uffice to ruin a reputation &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed as his was in Madrid. With this idea he gathered up &s;uch garments as he had already thrown off, and ha&s;tened towards the door. Elvira was aware of his de&s;ign: &s;he followed him, and, ere he could draw back the bolt, &s;eized him by the arm, and detained him.</P>
<P>"Attempt not to fly!" &s;aid &s;he: "you quit not this room without witne&s;&s;es of your guilt."</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">Ambro&s;io &s;truggled in vain to di&s;engage him&s;elf. Elvira quitted not her hold, but redoubled her cries for &s;uccour. The fri|ar's danger grew more urgent. He expected every moment to hear people a&s;&s;embling at her voice; and, worked up to madne&s;s by the approach of ruin, he adopted a re&s;olu|tion equally de&s;perate and &s;avage. Turn|ing round &s;uddenly, with one hand he gra&s;ped Elvira's throat &s;o as to prevent her continuing her clamour, and with the other, da&s;hing her violently upon the ground, he dragged her towards the bed. Confu&s;ed by this unexpected attack, &s;he &s;carcely had power to &s;trive at forcing her|&s;elf from his gra&s;p: while the monk, &s;natch|ing the pillow from beneath her daughter's head, covering with it Elvira's face, and pre&s;&s;ing his knee upon her &s;tomach with all his &s;trength, endeavoured to put an end to her exi&s;tence. He &s;ucceeded but too well. Her natural &s;trength increa&s;ed by the ex|ce&s;s of angui&s;h, long did the &s;ufferer &s;trug|gle
<PB N="44" REF="45">
to di&s;engage her&s;elf, but in vain. The monk continued to kneel upon her brea&s;t, witne&s;&s;ed without mercy the convul&s;ive trembling of her limbs beneath him, and &s;u&s;tained with inhuman firmne&s;s the &s;pecta|cle of her agonies, when &s;oul and body were on the point of &s;eparating. Tho&s;e agonies at length were over. She cea&s;ed to &s;truggle for life. The monk took off the pillow, and gazed upon her. Her face was covered with a frightful blackne&s;s: her limbs moved no more: the blood was chilled in her veins: her heart had forgotten to beat; and her hands were &s;tiff and frozen. Ambro&s;io beheld before him that once noble and ma|je&s;tic form, now become a cor&s;e, cold, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>This horrible act was no &s;ooner perpe|trated, than the friar beheld the enormity of his crime. A cold dew flowed over his limbs: his eyes clo&s;ed: he &s;taggered to a chair, and &s;ank into it almo&s;t as lifele&s;s as the unfortunate who lay extended at his
<PB N="45" REF="46">
feet. From this &s;tate he was rou&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ity of flight, and the danger of being found in Antonia's apartment. He had no de&s;ire to profit by the execution of his crime. Antonia now appeared to him an ob|ject of di&s;gu&s;t. A deadly cold had u&s;urped the place of that warmth which glowed in his bo&s;om. No ideas offered them&s;elves to his mind but tho&s;e of death and guilt, of pre&s;ent &s;hame and future puni&s;hment. Agi|tated by remor&s;e and fear, he prepared for flight: yet his terrors did not &s;o completely ma&s;ter his recollection, as to prevent his taking the precautions nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;afety. He replaced the pillow upon the bed, gathered up his garments, and, with the fatal tali&s;man in his hand, bent his un|&s;teady &s;teps towards the door. Bewildered by fear, he fancied that his flight was op|po&s;ed by legions of phantoms. Wherever he turned, the disfigured cor&s;e &s;eemed to lie in his pa&s;&s;age, and it was long before he &s;ucceeded in reaching the door. The enchanted myrtle produced its former ef|fect.
<PB N="46" REF="47">
The door opened, and he ha&s;tened down the &s;tair-ca&s;e. He entered the abbey unob&s;erved; and having &s;hut him&s;elf into his cell, he abandoned his &s;oul to the tor|tures of unavailing remor&s;e, and terrors of impending detection.</P>

<P>AMBROSIO &s;huddered at him&s;elf when he reflected on his rapid advances in ini+quity. The enormous crime which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;t committed, filled him with real horror. The murdered Elvira was continually before his eyes, and his guilt was already puni&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the agonies of his con&s;cience.

<PB N="48" REF="49">
was thrown upon him. Impunity recon|ciled him to his guilt. He began to re|&s;ume his &s;pirits; and as his fears of detec|tion died away, he paid le&s;s attention to the reproaches of remor&s;e. Matilda exerted her&s;elf to quiet his alarms. At the fir&s;t intelligence of Elvira's deaths, &s;he &s;eemed greatly affected, and joined the monk in deploring the unhappy cata&s;trophe of his adventure: but when &s;he found his agita|tion to be &s;omewhat calmed, and him&s;elf better di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to her arguments, &s;he proceeded to mention his offence in milder terms, and convince him that he was not &s;o highly culpable as he appeared to con&s;ider him&s;elf. She repre&s;ented, that he had only availed him&s;elf of the rights which nature allows to every one, tho&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation: that either Elvira or him&s;elf mu&s;t have peri&s;hed; and that her inflexibility and re&s;olution to ruin him had de&s;ervedly marked her out for the victim. She next &s;tated, that as he had before ren|dered him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected to Elvira, it was a
<PB N="49" REF="50">
fortunate event for him that her lips were clo&s;ed by death; &s;ince, without this la&s;t ad|venture, her &s;u&s;picions, if made public, might have produced very di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences. He had therefore freed him&s;elf from an enemy, to whom the errors of his conduct were &s;ufficiently known to make her dangerous, and who was the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to his de&s;igns upon Antonia. Tho&s;e de&s;igns &s;he encouraged him not to abandon. She a&s;&s;ured him that, no longer protected by her mother's watchful eye, the daughter would fall an ea&s;y conque&s;t; and by prai&s;ing and enumerating Antonia's charms, &s;he &s;trove to rekindle the de&s;ires of the monk. In this endeavour &s;he &s;ucceed|ed but too well.</P>
<P>As if the crimes into which his pa&s;&s;ion had &s;educed him, had only increa&s;ed its vi|olence, he longed more eagerly than ever to enjoy Antonia. The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in concealing his pre&s;ent guilt, he tru&s;ted, would attend his future. He was deaf to the murmurs of con&s;cience, and re&s;olved
<PB N="50" REF="51">
to &s;atisfy his de&s;ires at any price. He wait|ed only for an opportunity of repeating his former enterpri&s;e; but to procure that op|portunity by the &s;ame means was now im|practicable. In the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of de|&s;pair he had da&s;hed the enchanted myrtle into a thou&s;and pieces. Matilda told him plainly, that he mu&s;t expect no further a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the infernal powers, unle&s;s he was willing to &s;ub&s;cribe to their e&s;tabli&s;hed conditions. This Ambro&s;io was determined not to do. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf that, however great may be his iniquity, &s;o long as he pre&s;erved his claim to &s;alvation, he need not de&s;pair of pardon. He therefore re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to enter into any bond or compact with the fiends; and Matilda, find|ing him ob&s;tinate upon this point, forbore to pre&s;s him further. She exerted her in|vention to di&s;cover &s;ome means of putting Antonia into the abbot's power: nor was it long before that means pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>While her ruin was thus meditating, the unhappy girl her&s;elf &s;uffered &s;everely from
<PB N="51" REF="52">
the lo&s;s of her mother. Every morning on waking, it was her fir&s;t care to ha&s;ten to El|vira's chamber. On that which followed Ambro&s;io's fatal vi&s;it, &s;he woke later than was her u&s;ual cu&s;tom: of this &s;he was con|vinced by the abbey chimes. She &s;tarted from her bed, threw on a few loo&s;e garments ha&s;tily, and was &s;peeding to enquire how her mother had pa&s;&s;ed the night, when her foot &s;truck again&s;t &s;omething which lay in her pa&s;&s;age. She looked down. What was her horror at recognizing Elvira's livid cor&s;e! She uttered a loud &s;hriek, and threw her&s;elf upon the floor. She cla&s;ped the in|animate form to her bo&s;om, felt that it was dead cold, and, with a movement of di&s;gu&s;t, of which &s;he was not the mi&s;tre&s;s, let it fall again from her arms. The cry had alarm|ed Flora, who ha&s;tened to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;ight which &s;he beheld penetrated her with horror; but her alarm was more audi|ble than Antonia's. She made the hou&s;e ring with her lamentations, while her mi&s;|tre&s;s, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with grief, could only
<PB N="52" REF="53">
mark her di&s;tre&s;s by &s;obs and groans. Flo|ra's &s;hrieks &s;oon reached the ears of the ho&s;te&s;s, whole terror and &s;urpri&s;e were ex|ce&s;&s;ive on learning the cau&s;e of this di&s;turb|ance. A phy&s;ician was immediately &s;ent for; but, on the fir&s;t moment of beholding the cor&s;e, he declared that Elvira's recovery was beyond the power of art. He proceeded therefore to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Antonia, who by this time was truly in need of it. She was conveyed to bed, while the land|lady bu&s;ied her&s;elf in giving orders for Elvira's burial. Dame Jacintha was a plain good kind of woman, charitable, ge|nerous, and devout; but her intellects were weak, and &s;he was a mi&s;erable &s;lave to fear and &s;uper&s;tition. She &s;huddered at the idea of pa&s;&s;ing the night in the &s;ame hou&s;e with a dead body. She was per&s;uaded that Elvira's gho&s;t would appear to her, and no le&s;s certain that &s;uch a vi&s;it would kill her with fright. From this per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the night at a neigh|bour's, and in&s;i&s;ted that the funeral &s;hould
<PB N="53" REF="54">
take place the next day. St. Clare's ceme|tery being the neare&s;t, it was determined that Elvira &s;hould be buried there. Dame Jacintha engaged to defray every expence attending the burial. She knew not in what circum&s;tances Antonia was left; but, from the &s;paring manner in which the fa|mily had lived, &s;he concluded them to be indifferent: con&s;equently &s;he entertained very little hope of ever being recompen&s;ed. But this con&s;ideration prevented her not from taking care that the interment was performed with decency, and from &s;hew|ing the unfortunate Antonia all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Nobody dies of mere grief; of this An|tonia was an in&s;tance. Aided by her youth and healthy con&s;titution, &s;he &s;hook off the malady which her mother's death had oc|ca&s;ioned; but it was not &s;o ea&s;y to remove the di&s;ea&s;e of her mind. Her eyes were con&s;tantly filled with tears; every trifle af|fected her, and &s;he evidently nouri&s;hed in her bo&s;om a profound and rooted melan|choly.
<PB N="54" REF="55">
The &s;lighte&s;t mention of Elvira, the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance recalling that beloved parent to her memory, was &s;uf|ficient to throw her into &s;erious agitation. How much would her grief have been in|crea&s;ed, had &s;he known the agonies which terminated her mother's exi&s;tence! But of this no one entertained the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. Elvira was &s;ubject to &s;trong convul&s;ions: it was &s;uppo&s;ed that, aware of their approach, &s;he had dragged her&s;elf to her daughter's chamber in hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that a &s;ud|den acce&s;s of her fits had &s;eized her, too vi|olent to be re&s;i&s;ted by her already enfeebled &s;tate of health; and that &s;he had expired ere &s;he had time to reach the medicine which generally relieved her, and which &s;tood upon a &s;helf in Antonia's room. This idea was firmly credited by the few people who intere&s;ted them&s;elves about Elvira. Her death was e&s;teemed a natu|ral event, and &s;oon forgotten by all, &s;ave by her, who had but too much rea&s;on to deplore her lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">In truth Antonia's &s;ituation was &s;ufficient|ly embarra&s;&s;ing and unplea&s;ant. She was alone, in the mid&s;t of a di&s;&s;ipated and ex|pen&s;ive city; &s;he was ill provided with money, and wor&s;e with friends. Her aunt Leonella was &s;till at Cordova, and &s;he knew not her direction. Of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas &s;he heard no news. As to Lo|renzo, &s;he had long given up the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any intere&s;t in his bo&s;om. She knew not to whom &s;he could addre&s;s her|&s;elf in her pre&s;ent dilemma. She wi&s;hed to con&s;ult Ambro&s;io, but &s;he remembered her mother's injunctions to &s;hun him as much as po&s;&s;ible; and the la&s;t conver&s;ation which Elvira had held with her upon the &s;ubject, had given her &s;ufficient lights re|&s;pecting his de&s;igns, to put her upon her guard again&s;t him in future. Still all her mother's warnings could not make her change her good opinion of the friar. She continued to feel that his friend&s;hip and &s;ociety were requi&s;ite to her happine&s;s: &s;he looked upon his failings with a partial eye,
<PB N="56" REF="57">
and could not per&s;uade her&s;elf that he re|ally had intended her ruin. However, Elvira had po&s;itively commanded her to drop his acquaintance, and &s;he had too much re&s;pect for her orders to di&s;obey them.</P>
<P>At length &s;he re&s;olved to addre&s;s her&s;elf for advice and protection to the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, as being her neare&s;t rela|tion. She wrote to him, briefly &s;tating her de&s;olate &s;ituation; &s;he be&s;ought him to compa&s;&s;ionate his brother's child, to conti|nue to her Elvira's pen&s;ion, and to autho|ri&s;e her retiring to his old ca&s;tle in Murcia, which till now had been her retreat. Hav|ing &s;ealed her letter, &s;he gave it to the tru&s;ty Flora, who immediately &s;et out to execute her commi&s;&s;ion. But Antonia was born under an unlucky &s;tar. Had &s;he made her application to the marquis but one day &s;ooner, received as his niece, and placed at the head of his family, &s;he would have e&s;caped all the misfortunes with which &s;he was now threatened. Raymond had
<PB N="57" REF="58">
always intended to execute this plan: but fir&s;t, his hopes of making the propo&s;al to Elvira through the lips of Agnes, and af|terwards his di&s;appointment at lo&s;ing his intended bride, as well as the &s;evere illne&s;s which for &s;ome time had confined him to his bed, made him defer from day to day the giving an a&s;ylum in his hou&s;e to his brother's widow. He had commi&s;&s;ioned Lorenzo to &s;upply her liberally with mo|ney. But Elvira, unwilling to receive ob|ligations from that nobleman, had a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he needed no immediate pecu|niary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Con&s;equently the mar|quis did not imagine that a trifling delay on his part would create any embarra&s;&s;|ment; and the di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of his mind might well excu&s;e his negligence.</P>
<P>Had he been informed that Elvira's death had left her daughter friendle&s;s and unpro|tected, he would doubtle&s;s have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have en&s;ured her from every danger. But Antonia was not de&s;tined to be &s;o fortunate. The day on
<PB N="58" REF="59">
which &s;he &s;ent her letter to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas, was that following Lorenzo's departure from Madrid. The marquis was in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair at the con|viction that Agnes was indeed no more: he was delirious; and, his life being in dan|ger, no one was &s;uffered to approach him. Flora was informed that he was incapable of attending to letters, and that probably a few hours would decide his fate. With this un&s;atisfactory an&s;wer &s;he was obliged to return to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who now found her&s;elf plunged into greater difficulties than ever.</P>
<P>Flora and Dame Jacintha exerted them|&s;elves to con&s;ole her. The latter begged her to make her&s;elf ea&s;y, for that as long as &s;he cho&s;e to &s;tay with her &s;he would treat her like her own child. Antonia, finding that the good woman had taken a real af|fection for her, was &s;omewhat comforted by thinking that &s;he had at lea&s;t one friend in the world. A letter was now brought to her, directed to Elvira. She recognized
<PB N="59" REF="60">
Leonella's writing, and, opening it with joy, found a detailed account of her aunt's adventures at Cordova. She informed her &s;i&s;ter that &s;he had recovered her legacy, had lo&s;t her heart, and had received in ex|change that of the mo&s;t amiable of apothe|caries, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. She added, that &s;he &s;hould be at Madrid on the Tue&s;day night, and meant to have the plea&s;ure of pre&s;enting her caro &s;po&s;o in form. Though her nuptials were far from plea&s;ing Antonia, Leonella's &s;peedy return gave her niece much delight. She rejoiced in thinking that &s;he &s;hould once more be under a relation's care. She could not but judge it to be highly improper for a young woman to be living among ab&s;olute &s;trangers, with no one to regulate her con|duct, or protect her from the in&s;ults to which in her defencele&s;s &s;ituation &s;he was expo&s;ed. She therefore looked forward with impatience to the Tue&s;day night.</P>
<P>It arrived. Antonia li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly to the carriages as they rolled along the
<PB N="60" REF="61">
&s;treet. None of them &s;topped, and it grew late without Leonella's appearing. Still Antonia re&s;olved to &s;it up till her aunt's arrival; and, in &s;pite of all her remon&s;trances, Dame Jacintha and Flora in&s;i&s;ted upon doing the &s;ame. The hours pa&s;&s;ed on &s;low and tediou&s;ly. Lorenzo's departure from Madrid had put a &s;top to the nightly &s;erenades: &s;he hoped in vain to hear the u&s;ual &s;ound of guitars beneath her window. She took up her own, and &s;truck a few chords; but mu&s;ic that evening had lo&s;t its charms for her, and &s;he &s;oon replaced the in&s;tru|ment in its ca&s;e. She &s;eated her&s;elf at her embroidery frame, but nothing went right: the &s;ilks were mi&s;&s;ing, the thread &s;napped every moment, and the needles were &s;o ex|pert at falling that they &s;eemed to be ani|mated. At length a &s;lake of wax fell from the taper which &s;tood near her upon a fa|vourite wreath of violets: this completely di&s;compo&s;ed her; &s;he threw down her needle, and quitted the frame. It was de|creed that for that night nothing &s;hould
<PB N="61" REF="62">
have the power of amu&s;ing her. She was the prey of ennui, and employed her&s;elf in making fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes for the arrival of her aunt.</P>
<P>As &s;he walked with a li&s;tle&s;s air up and down the chamber, the door caught her eye conducing to that which had been her mother's. She remembered that Elvira's little library was arranged there, and thought that &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly find in it &s;ome book to amu&s;e her till Leonella &s;hould arrive. Accordingly &s;he took her taper from the table, pa&s;&s;ed through the little clo&s;et, and entered the adjoining apart|ment. As &s;he looked around her, the &s;ight of this room brought to her recollec|tion a thou&s;and painful ideas. It was the fir&s;t time of her entering it &s;ince her mo|ther's death. The total &s;ilence prevailing through the chamber, the bed de&s;poiled of its furniture, the cheerle&s;s hearth where &s;tood an extingui&s;hed lamp, and a few dy|ing plants in the window, which &s;ince El|vira's lo&s;s had been neglected, in&s;pired
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Antonia with a melancholy awe. The gloom of night gave &s;trength to this &s;en&s;a|tion. She placed her light upon the table, and &s;unk into a large chair, in which &s;he had &s;een her mother &s;eated a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times. She was never to &s;ee her &s;eated there again! Tears unbidden &s;tream|ed down her cheek, and &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to the &s;adne&s;s which grew deeper with every moment.</P>
<P>A&s;hamed of her weakne&s;s, &s;he at length ro&s;e from her &s;eat; &s;he proceeded to &s;eek for what had brought her to this melancholy &s;cene. The &s;mall collection of books was arranged upon &s;everal &s;helves in order. Antonia examined them without finding any thing likely to intere&s;t her, till &s;he put her hand upon a volume of old Spani&s;h ballads. She read a few &s;tanzas of one of them. They excited her curio&s;ity. She took down the book, and &s;eated her&s;elf to peru&s;e it with ea&s;e. She trimmed the taper, which now drew towards its end, and then read the following ballad:

<P>The peru&s;al of this &s;tory was ill calculated to di&s;pel Antonia's melancholy. She had naturally a &s;trong inclination to the mar|vellous; and her nur&s;e, who believed firm|ly in apparitions, had related to her, when an infant, &s;o many horrible adventures of this kind, that all Elvira's attempts had failed to eradicate their impre&s;&s;ions from her daughter's mind. Antonia &s;till nou|ri&s;hed a &s;uper&s;titious prejudice in her bo|&s;om: &s;he was often &s;u&s;ceptible of terrors, which, when &s;he di&s;covered their natural and in&s;ignificant cau&s;e, made her blu&s;h at
<PB N="67" REF="68">
her own weakne&s;s. With &s;uch a turn of mind, the adventure which &s;he had ju&s;t been reading &s;ufficed to give her appre|hen&s;ions the alarm. The hour and the &s;cene combined to authori&s;e them. It was the dead of night; &s;he was alone, and in the chamber once occupied by her decea&s;ed mother. The weather was comfortle&s;s and &s;tormy; the wind howled around the hou&s;e, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain pattered again&s;t the windows. No other &s;ound was heard. The taper, now burnt down to the &s;ocket, &s;ometimes flaring upwards, &s;hot a gleam of light through the room, then &s;inking again &s;eem|ed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to ri&s;e from her &s;eat, but her limbs trembled &s;o violently that &s;he was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great di&s;tance; but agitation choked
<PB N="68" REF="69">
her voice, and her cries died away in hol|low murmurs.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome minutes in this &s;ituation, after which her terrors began to dimini&s;h. She &s;trove to recover her&s;elf, and acquire &s;trength enough to quit the room. Sud|denly &s;he fancied that &s;he heard a low &s;igh drawn near her. This idea brought back her former weakne&s;s. She had already rai&s;ed her&s;elf from her &s;eat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noi&s;e &s;topped her; &s;he drew back her hand, and &s;upported her&s;elf upon the back of a chair. She li&s;tened anxiou&s;|ly, but nothing more was heard.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "what could be that &s;ound? Was I de|ceived, or did I really hear it?"</P>
<P>Her reflections were interrupted by a voice at the door &s;carcely audible; it &s;eem|ed as if &s;omebody was whi&s;pering. Anto|nia's alarm increa&s;ed; yet the bolt &s;he knew to be fa&s;tened, and this idea in &s;ome degree re-a&s;&s;ured her. Pre&s;ently the latch was
<PB N="69" REF="70">
lifted up &s;oftly, and the door moved with caution backwards and forwards. Exce&s;s of terror now &s;upplied Antonia with that &s;trength, of which &s;he had till then been deprived. She &s;tarted from her place, and made towards the clo&s;et door, whence &s;he might &s;oon have reached the chamber where &s;he expected to find Flora and Dame Ja|cintha. Scarcely had &s;he reached the middle of the room, when the latch was lifted up a &s;econd time. An involuntary movement obliged her to turn her head. Slowly and gradually the door turned upon its hinges, and &s;tanding upon the thre&s;hold &s;he beheld a tall thin figure, wrapped in a white &s;hroud which covered it from head to foot.</P>
<P>This vi&s;ion arre&s;ted her feet; &s;he re|mained as if petrified in the middle of the apartment. The &s;tranger with mea&s;ured and &s;olemn &s;teps drew near the table. The dying taper darted a blue and melancholy flame as the figure advanced towards it. Over the table was fixed a &s;mall clock; the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
hand of it was upon the &s;troke of three. The figure &s;topped oppo&s;ite to the clock: it rai&s;ed its right arm, and pointed to the hour, at the &s;ame time looking earne&s;tly upon Antonia, who waited for the conclu|&s;ion of this &s;cene, motionle&s;s and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The figure remained in this po&s;ture for &s;ome moments. The clock &s;truck. When the &s;ound had cea&s;ed, the &s;tranger advan|ced yet a few &s;teps nearer Antonia.</P>
<P>"Yet three days," &s;aid a voice &s;aint, hollow, and &s;epulchral; "yet three days, and we meet again!"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;huddered at the words.</P>
<P>"We meet again?" &s;he pronounced at length with difficulty: "Where &s;hall we meet? Whom &s;hall I meet?"</P>
<P>The figure pointed to the ground with one hand, and with the other rai&s;ed the linen which covered its face.</P>
<P>"Almighty God! My mother?"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;hrieked, and fell lifele&s;s upon the floor.</P>
<P>Dame Jacintha, who was at work in a
<PB N="71" REF="72">
neighbouring chamber, was alarmed by the cry: Flora was ju&s;t gone down &s;tairs to fetch fre&s;h oil for the lamp by which they had been &s;itting. Jacintha therefore ha&s;t|ened alone to Antonia's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and great was her amazement to find her ex|tended upon the floor. She rai&s;ed her in her arms, conveyed her to her apartment, and placed her upon the bed, &s;till &s;en&s;ele&s;s. She then proceeded to bathe her temples, chafe her hands, and u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means of bringing her to her&s;elf. With &s;ome dif|ficulty the &s;ucceeded. Antonia opened her eyes, and looked round her wildly.</P>
<P>"Where is &s;he?" &s;he cried in a trem|bling voice: "Is &s;he gone? Am I &s;afe? Speak to me! Comfort me! Oh! &s;peak to me, for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>"Safe from whom, my child?" replied the a&s;toni&s;hed Jacintha: "What alarms you? Of whom are you afraid?"</P>
<P>"In three days! She told me that we &s;hould meet in three days! I heard her &s;ay
<PB N="72" REF="73">
it! I &s;aw her, Jacintha, I &s;aw her but this moment!"</P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf upon Jacintha's bo|&s;om.</P>
<P>"You &s;aw her?&mdash;Saw whom?</P>
<P>"My mother's gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Chri&s;t Je&s;us!" cried Jacintha; and, &s;tarting from the bed, let fall Antonia upon the pillow, and fled in con&s;ternation out of the room.</P>
<P>As &s;he ha&s;tened down &s;tairs, &s;he met Flora a&s;cending them.</P>
<P>"Go to your mi&s;tre&s;s, Flora," &s;aid &s;he; "here are rare doings! Oh! I am the mo&s;t unfortunate woman alive! My hou&s;e is filled with gho&s;ts and dead bodies, and the Lord knows what be&s;ides; yet I am &s;ure nobody likes &s;uch company le&s;s than I do. But go your way to Donna Antonia, Flora, and let me go mine."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he continued her cour&s;e to the &s;treet-door, which &s;he opened; and, without allowing her&s;elf time to throw on
<PB N="73" REF="74">
her oil, &s;he made the be&s;t of her way to the Capuchin-abbey. In the mean while, Flo|ra ha&s;tened to her lady's chamber, equally &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed at Jacintha's con&s;ter|nation. She found Antonia lying upon the bed, in&s;en&s;ible. She u&s;ed the &s;ame means for her recovery that Jacintha had already employed; but finding that her mi&s;tre&s;s only recovered from one fit to fall into another, &s;he &s;ent in all ha&s;te for a phy|&s;ician. While expecting his arrival, &s;he undre&s;&s;ed Antonia, and conveyed her to bed.</P>
<P>Heedle&s;s of the &s;torm, terrified almo&s;t out of her &s;en&s;es, Jacintha ran through the &s;treets, and &s;topped not till &s;he reached the gate of the abbey. She rang loudly at the bell; and as &s;oon as the porter appeared, &s;he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to the &s;upe|rior. Ambro&s;io was then conferring with Matilda upon the means of procuring ac|ce&s;s to Antonia. The cau&s;e of Elvira's death remaining unknown, he was con|vinced that crimes were not &s;o &s;wiftly fol|lowed
<PB N="74" REF="75">
by puni&s;hment as his in&s;tructors the monks had taught him, and as till then he had him&s;elf believed. This per&s;ua&s;ion made him re&s;olve upon Antonia's ruin, for the enjoyment of who&s;e per&s;on dangers and difficulties only &s;eemed to have in|crea&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion. The monk had al|ready made one attempt to gain admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence; but Flora had refu&s;ed him in &s;uch a manner as to convince him that all future endeavours mu&s;t be vain. El|vira had confided her &s;u&s;picions to that tru&s;ty &s;ervant: &s;he had de&s;ired her never to leave Ambro&s;io alone with her daughter, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their meeting al|together. Flora promi&s;ed to obey her, and had executed her orders to the very letter. Ambro&s;io's vi&s;it had been rejected that morning, though Antonia was ignorant of it. He &s;aw that to obtain a &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s by open means was out of the que|&s;tion; and both him&s;elf and Matilda had con&s;umed the night in endeavouring to in|vent &s;ome plan, who&s;e event might be more
<PB N="75" REF="76">
&s;ucce&s;sful. Such was their employment when a lay-brother entered the abbot's cell, and informed him that a woman call|ing her&s;elf Jacintha Zuniga reque&s;ted au|dience for a few minutes.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to grant the petition of his vi&s;itor. He refu&s;ed it po&s;itively, and bade the lay-brother tell the &s;tranger to return the next day. Matilda interrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>"See this woman," &s;aid &s;he in a low voice; "I have my rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>The abbot obeyed her, and &s;ignified that he would go to the parlour immediately. With this an&s;wer the lay-brother withdrew. As &s;oon as they were alone, Ambro&s;io en|quired why Matilda wi&s;hed him to &s;ee this Jacintha.</P>
<P>"She is Antonia's ho&s;te&s;s," replied Ma|tilda; "&s;he may po&s;&s;ibly be of u&s;e to you but let us examine her, and learn what brings her hither."</P>
<P>They proceeded together to the parlour, where Jacintha was already waiting for the
<PB N="76" REF="77">
abbot. She had conceived a great opinion of his piety and virtue; and, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have much influence over the devil, thought that it mu&s;t be an ea&s;y matter for him to lay Elvira's gho&s;t in the red &s;ea. Filled with this per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he had ha&s;ten|ed to the abbey. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw the monk enter the parlour, &s;he dropped upon her knees, and began her &s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>"Oh! reverend father! &s;uch an acci|dent! &s;uch an adventure! I know not what cour&s;e to take; and unle&s;s you can help me, I &s;hall certainly go di&s;tracted. Well, to be &s;ure, never was woman &s;o unfortunate as my&s;elf! All in my power to keep clear of &s;uch abomination have I done, and yet that all is too little. What &s;ignifies my telling my beads four times a day, and ob&s;erving every fa&s;t pre&s;cribed by the calendar? What &s;ignifies my having made three pil|grimages to St. James of Compo&s;tella, and purcha&s;ed as many pardons from the pope as would buy off Cain's puni&s;hment? No|thing pro&s;pers with me! All goes wrong,
<PB N="77" REF="78">
and God only knows whether any thing will ever go right again! Why now, be your holine&s;s the judge&mdash;My lodger dies in convul&s;ions; out of pure kindne&s;s I bury her at my own expence; [not that &s;he is any relation of mine, or that I &s;hall be be|nefited a &s;ingle pi&s;tole by her death: I got nothing by it, and therefore you know, re|verend father, that her living or dying was ju&s;t the &s;ame to me. But that is nothing to the purpo&s;e; to return to what I was &s;aying], I took care of her funeral, had every thing performed decently and pro|perly, and put my&s;elf to expence enough, God knows! And how do you think the lady repays me for my kindne&s;s? Why truly by refu&s;ing to &s;leep quietly in her comfortable deal coffin, as a peaceable well di&s;po&s;ed &s;pirit ought to do, and com|ing to plague me, who never wi&s;h to &s;et eyes on her again. For&s;ooth it well be|comes her to go racketing about my hou&s;e at midnight, popping into her daughter's room through the key hole, and frighten|ing
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the poor child out of her wits! Though &s;he be a gho&s;t, &s;he might be more civil than to bolt into a per&s;on's hou&s;e who likes her company &s;o little. But as for me, re|verend father, the plain &s;tate of the ca&s;e is this: if &s;he walks into my hou&s;e, I mu&s;t walk out of it, for I cannot abide &s;uch vi&s;i|tors&mdash;not I. Thus you &s;ee, your &s;anctity, that without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance I am ruined and undone for ever. I &s;hall be obliged to quit my hou&s;e: nobody will take it, when 'tis known that &s;he haunts it, and then I &s;hall find my&s;elf in a fine &s;ituation. Mi&s;erable woman that I am! what &s;hall I do? what will become of me?"</P>
<P>Here &s;he wept bitterly, wrung her hands, and begged to know the abbot's opinion of her ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"In truth, good woman," replied he, "it will be difficult for me to relieve you, without knowing what is the matter with you. You have forgotten to tell me what has happened, and what it is you want."</P>
<P>"Let me die," cried Jacintha, "but
<PB N="79" REF="80">
your &s;anctity is in the right. This then is the fact &s;tated briefly&mdash;A lodger of mine is lately dead; a very good &s;ort of woman, that I mu&s;t needs &s;ay for her; as far as my knowledge of her went, though that was not a great way. She kept me too much at a di&s;tance; for indeed &s;he was given to be upon the high ropes; and when|ever I ventured to &s;peak to her, &s;he had a look with her which always made me feel a little queeri&s;h: God forgive me for &s;aying &s;o! However, though &s;he was more &s;tately than needful, and affected to look down upon me (though, if I am well informed, I come of as good parents as &s;he could do for her ears, for her father was a &s;hoe-maker at Cordova, and mine was an hatter at Madrid&mdash;aye, and a very creditable hatter too, let me tell you), yet for all her pride &s;he was a quiet well-behaved body, and I never wi&s;h to have a better lodger. This makes me wonder the more at her not &s;leep|ing quietly in her grave; but there is no tru&s;ting to people in this world. For my
<PB N="80" REF="81">
part, I never &s;aw her do ami&s;s, except on the Friday before her death. To be &s;ure, I was then much &s;candalized by &s;eeing her eat the wing of a chicken. 'How, Madona Flora!' quoth I (Flora, may it plea&s;e your reverence, is the name of the waiting maid) &mdash;'how, Madona Flora!' quoth I, 'does your mi&s;tre&s;s eat fle&s;h upon Fridays? Well! well! &s;ee the event, and then remember that Dame Jacintha warned you of it!' The&s;e were my very words; but, alas! I might as well have held my tongue. No|body minded me; and Flora, who is &s;ome|what pert and &s;nappi&s;h (more is the pity, &s;ay I), told me, that there was no more harm in eating a chicken than the egg from which it came: nay &s;he even declared, that if her lady added a &s;lice of bacon, &s;he would not be an inch nearer damnation. God protect us! a poor ignorant &s;inful &s;oul! I prote&s;t to your holine&s;s, I trembled to hear her utter &s;uch bla&s;phemies, and expected every moment to &s;ee the ground open and &s;wallow her up, chicken and all; for you mu&s;t know, wor|&s;hipful
<PB N="81" REF="82">
father, that while &s;he talked thus, &s;he held the plate in her hand on which lay the identical roa&s;t fowl: and a fine bird it was, that I mu&s;t &s;ay for it&mdash;done to a turn, for I &s;uperintended the cooking of it my|&s;elf. It was a little gallician of my own rai&s;ing, may it plea&s;e your holine&s;s, and the fle&s;h was as white as an egg-&s;hell, as indeed Donna Elvira told me her&s;elf. 'Dame Jacintha," &s;aid &s;he very good-humouredly, though to &s;ay the truth &s;he was always very polite to me&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here Ambro&s;io's patience failed him. Eager to know Jacintha's bu&s;ine&s;s in which Antonia &s;eemed to be concerned, he was almo&s;t di&s;tracted while li&s;tening to the ramb|ling of this pro&s;ing old woman. He inter|rupted her, and prote&s;ted that if &s;he did not immediately tell her &s;tory and have done with it, he &s;hould quit the parlour, and leave her to get out of her difficulties by her&s;elf. This threat had the de&s;ired effect. Jacintha related her bu&s;ine&s;s in as few words as &s;he could manage: but her
<PB N="82" REF="83">
account was &s;till &s;o prolix, that Ambro&s;io had need of his patience to bear him to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"And &s;o, your reverence," &s;aid &s;he, af|ter relating Elvira's death and burial, with all their circum&s;tances&mdash;"and &s;o, your reverence, upon hearing the &s;hriek, I put away my work, and away po&s;ted I to Donna Antonia's chamber. Finding nobody there, I pa&s;&s;ed on to the next: but I mu&s;t own I was a little timorous at going in; for this was the very room where Donna Elvira u&s;ed to &s;leep. However in I went, and &s;ure enough there lay the young lady at full length upon the floor, as cold as a &s;tone, and as white as a &s;heet. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at this, as your holine&s;s may well &s;uppo&s;e: but, oh me! how I &s;hook when I &s;aw a great tall figure at my elbow, who&s;e head touched the cieling! The face was Donna Elvira's, I mu&s;t confe&s;s; but out of its mouth came clouds of fire; its arms were loaded with heavy chains, which it rattled piteou&s;ly; and every hair on its head was a &s;erpent as big
<PB N="83" REF="84">
as my arm. At this I was frightened enough, and began to &s;ay my ave-maria: but the gho&s;t interrupting me uttered three loud groans, and roared out in a terrible voice, 'Oh! that chicken's wing! my poor &s;oul &s;uffers for it.' As &s;oon as &s;he had &s;aid this, the ground opened, the &s;pectre &s;ank down; I heard a clap of thunder, and the room was filled with a &s;mell of brim&s;tone. When I recovered from my fright, and had brought Donna Antonia to her&s;elf, who told me that &s;he had cried out upon &s;eeing her mother's gho&s;t (and well might &s;he cry, poor &s;oul! had I been in her place, I &s;hould have cried, ten times louder), it directly came into my head, that if any one had power to quiet this &s;pectre, it mu&s;t be your reverence. So hither I came in all diligence, to beg that you will &s;prinkle my hou&s;e with holy water, and lay the apparition in the Red Sea."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;tared at this &s;trange &s;tory, which he could not credit.</P>
<P>"Did Donna Antonia al&s;o &s;ee the gho&s;t?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">"As plain as I &s;ee you, reverend fa|ther."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io pau&s;ed for a moment. Here was an opportunity offered him of gaining acce&s;s to Antonia, but he he&s;itated to em|ploy it. The reputation which he enjoyed in Madrid was &s;till dear to him; and &s;ince he had lo&s;t the reality of virtue, it appeared as if its &s;emblance was become more valu|able. He was con&s;cious that publicly to break through the rule never to quit the abbey-precincts would derogate much from his &s;uppo&s;ed au&s;terity. In vi&s;iting Elvira, he had always taken care to keep his fea|tures concealed from the dome&s;tics. Except by the lady, her daughter, and the faithful Flora, he was known in the family by no other name than that of father Jerome. Should he comply with Jacintha's reque&s;t, and accompany her to her hou&s;e, he knew that the violation of his rule could not be kept a &s;ecret. However, his eagerne&s;s to &s;ee Antonia obtained the victory. He even hoped that the &s;ingularity of this adven|ture
<PB N="85" REF="86">
would ju&s;tify him in the eyes of Madrid. But whatever might be the con&s;equences, he re&s;olved to profit by the opportunity which chance had pre&s;ented to him. An expre&s;&s;ive look from Matilda confirmed him in this re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"Good woman," &s;aid he to Jacintha, "what you tell me is &s;o extraordinary that I can &s;carcely credit your a&s;&s;ertions. How|ever, I will comply with your reque&s;t. To-morrow, after matins, you may expect me at your hou&s;e: I will then examine into what I can do for you; and if it is in my power, will free you from this unwelcome vi&s;itor. Now then go home, and peace be with you!"</P>
<P>"Home!" exclaimed Jacintha; "I go home? Not I, by my troth!&mdash;except under your protection, I &s;et no foot of mine within the thre&s;hold. God help me! the gho&s;t may meet me upon the &s;tairs, and whi&s;k me away with her to the devil! Oh! that I had accepted young Melchior Ba&s;co's offer! then I would have had &s;omebody to pro|tect
<PB N="86" REF="87">
me; but now I am a lone woman, and meet with nothing but cro&s;&s;es and misfor|tunes. Thank Heaven it is not yet too late to repent. There is Simon Gonzalez will have me any day of the week; and if I live till day-break, I will marry him out of hand: an hu&s;band I will have, that is de|termined; for, now this gho&s;t is once in my hou&s;e, I &s;hall be frightened out of my wits to &s;leep alone. But, for God's &s;ake, reve|rend father! come with me now. I &s;hall have no re&s;t till the hou&s;e is purified, or the poor young lady either. The dear girl! &s;he is in a piteous taking: I left her in &s;trong convul&s;ions, and I doubt &s;he will not ea&s;ily recover her fright."</P>
<P>The friar &s;tarted, and interrupted her ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"In convul&s;ions, &s;ay you? Antonia in convul&s;ions? Lead on, good woman, I fol|low you this moment."</P>
<P>Jacintha in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;topping to furni&s;h him&s;elf with the ve&s;&s;el of holy wa|ter. With this reque&s;t he complied. Think|ing
<PB N="87" REF="88">
her&s;elf &s;afe under his protection &s;hould a legion of gho&s;ts attack her, the old wo|man returned the monk a profu&s;ion of thanks, and they departed together for the &s;trada di San Iago.</P>
<P>So &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion had the &s;pectre made upon Antonia, that for the fir&s;t two or three hours the phy&s;ician declared her life to be in danger. The fits at length becoming le&s;s frequent, induced him to al|ter his opinion. He &s;aid that to keep her quiet was all that was nece&s;&s;ary; and he ordered a medicine to be prepared, which would tranquillize her nerves, and procure her that repo&s;e which at pre&s;ent &s;he much wanted. The &s;ight of Ambro&s;io, who now appeared with Jacintha at her bed-&s;ide, contributed e&s;&s;entially to compo&s;e her ruf|fled &s;pirits. Elvira had not &s;ufficiently ex|plained her&s;elf upon the nature of his de|&s;igns, to make a girl &s;o ignorant of the world as her daughter aware how dangerous was his acquaintance. At this moment, when penetrated with horror at the &s;cene which
<PB N="88" REF="89">
had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and dreading to contem|plate the gho&s;t's prediction, her mind had need of all the &s;uccours of friend&s;hip and religion. Antonia regarded the abbot with an eye doubly partial. That &s;trong prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour &s;till exi&s;ted, which &s;he had felt for him at fir&s;t &s;ight: &s;he fancied, yet knew not wherefore, that his pre&s;ence was a &s;afeguard to her from every danger, in&s;ult, or misfortune. She thanked him gratefully for his vi&s;it, and related to him the adven|ture which had alarmed her &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The abbot &s;trove to re-a&s;&s;ure her and convince her that the whole had been a de|ception of her over-heated fancy. The &s;o|litude in which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the evening, the gloom of night, the book which &s;he had been reading, and the room in which &s;he &s;at, were all calculated to place before her &s;uch a vi&s;ion. He treated the idea of gho&s;ts with ridicule, and produced &s;trong argu|ments to prove the fallacy of &s;uch a &s;y&s;|tem. His conver&s;ation tranquillized and comforted her, but did not convince her.
<PB N="89" REF="90">
She could not believe that the &s;pectre had been a mere creature of her imagination: every circum&s;tance was impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind too forcibly to permit her flattering her&s;elf with &s;uch an idea. She per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting that &s;he had really &s;een her mo|ther's gho&s;t, had heard the period of her di&s;&s;olution announced, and declared that &s;he never &s;hould quit her bed alive. Am|bro&s;io advi&s;ed her again&s;t encouraging the&s;e &s;entiments, and then quitted her chamber, having promi&s;ed to repeat his vi&s;it on the morrow. Antonia received this a&s;&s;urance with every mark of joy: but the monk ea&s;ily perceived that he was not equally ac|ceptable to her attendant. Flora obeyed Elvira's injunctions with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous ob&s;ervance. She examined with an anxious eye every circum&s;tance likely in the lea&s;t to prejudice her young mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom &s;he had been attached for many years. She was a native of Cuba, had followed Elvira to Spain, and loved the young Antonia
<PB N="90" REF="91">
with a mother's affection. Flora quitted not the room for a moment while the abbot remained there: &s;he watched his every word, his every look, his every action. He &s;aw that her &s;u&s;picious eye was always fixed upon him; and, con&s;cious that his de&s;igns would not bear in&s;pection &s;o minute, he felt frequently confu&s;ed and di&s;concerted. He was aware that &s;he doubted the purity of his intentions; that &s;he would never leave him alone with Antonia; and, his mi&s;tre&s;s defended by the pre&s;ence of this vigilant ob&s;erver, he de&s;paired of finding the means to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As he quitted the hou&s;e, Jacintha met him, and begged that &s;ome ma&s;&s;es might be &s;ung for the repo&s;e of Elvira's &s;oul, which &s;he doubted not was &s;uffering in purgatory.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed not to forget her reque&s;t; but he perfectly gained the old woman's heart, by engaging to watch during the whole of the approaching night in the haunted chamber. Jacintha could find no
<PB N="91" REF="92">
terms &s;ufficiently &s;trong to expre&s;s her gra|titude, and the monk departed loaded with her benedictions.</P>
<P>It was broad day when he returned to the abbey. His fir&s;t care was to communi|cate what had pa&s;&s;ed to his confidante. He felt too &s;incere a pa&s;&s;ion for Antonia, to have heard unmoved the prediction of her &s;peedy death, and he &s;huddered at the idea of lo&s;ing an object &s;o dear to him. Upon this head Matilda re-a&s;&s;ured him. She con|firmed the arguments which him&s;elf had already u&s;ed: &s;he declared Antonia to have been deceived by the wandering of her brain, by the &s;pleen which oppre&s;&s;ed her at the moment, and by the natural turn of her mind to &s;uper&s;tition and the marvellous. As to Jacintha's account, the ab&s;urdity re|futed it&s;elf. The abbot he&s;itated not to believe that &s;he had fabricated the whole &s;tory, either confu&s;ed by terror, or hoping to make him comply more readily with her reque&s;t. Having over-ruled the monk's ap|prehen&s;ions, Matilda continued thus:</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">"The prediction and the gho&s;t are equally fal&s;e: but it mu&s;t be your care, Ambro&s;io, to verify the fir&s;t. Antonia within three days mu&s;t indeed be dead to the world: but &s;he mu&s;t live for you. Her pre&s;ent illne&s;s, and this fancy which &s;he has taken into her head, will colour a plan which I have long meditated, but which was im|practicable without your procuring acce&s;s to Antonia. She &s;hall be yours, not for a &s;ingle night, but for ever. All the vigilance of her duenna &s;hall not avail her. You &s;hall riot unre&s;trained in the charms of your mi&s;tre&s;s. This very day mu&s;t the &s;cheme be put in execution, for you have no time to lo&s;e. The nephew of the duke of Me|dina Celi prepares to demand Antonia for his bride: in a few days &s;he will be removed to the palace of her relation, the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, and there &s;he will be &s;ecure from your attempts. Thus during your ab&s;ence have I been informed by my &s;pies, who are ever employed in bringing me in|telligence for your &s;ervice. Now then li&s;ten
<PB N="93" REF="94">
to me. There is a juice extracted from certain herbs known but to few, which brings on the per&s;on who drinks it the exact image of death. Let this be admini&s;tered to Antonia: you may ea&s;ily find means to pour a few drops into her medicine. The effect will be throwing her into &s;trong con|vul&s;ions for an hour: after which her blood will gradually cea&s;e to flow, and heart to beat: a mortal palene&s;s will &s;pread it&s;elf over her features, and &s;he will appear a cor&s;e to every eye. She has no friends about her: you may charge your&s;elf un&s;u&s;|pected with the &s;uperintendence of her fu|neral, and cau&s;e her to be buried in the vaults of St. Clare. Their &s;olitude and ea&s;y acce&s;s render the&s;e caverns favourable to your de&s;igns. Give Antonia the &s;opo|rific draught this evening: eight-and forty hours after &s;he has drank it, life will revive in her bo&s;om. She will then be ab&s;olutely in your power: &s;he will find all re&s;i&s;tance unavailing, and nece&s;&s;ity will compel her to receive you in her arms."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">"Antonia will be in my power!" ex|claimed the monk; "Matilda, you tran&s;|port me! At length then happine&s;s will be mine, and that happine&s;s will be Matilda's gift, will be the gift of friend&s;hip! I &s;hall cla&s;p Antonia in my arms, far from every prying eye, from every tormenting in|truder! I &s;hall &s;igh out my &s;oul upon her bo&s;om; &s;hall teach her young heart the fir&s;t rudiments of plea&s;ure, and revel uncon|trouled in the endle&s;s variety of her charms! And &s;hall this delight indeed be mine? Shall I give the reins to my de&s;ires, and gratify every wild tumultuous wi&s;h? Oh! Matilda, how can I expre&s;s to you my gra|titude?"</P>
<P>"By profiting by my coun&s;els. Ambro|&s;io, I live but to &s;erve you; your intere&s;t and happine&s;s are equally mine. Be your per&s;on Antonia's, but to your friend&s;hip and your heart I &s;till a&s;&s;ert my claim. Contributing to yours, forms now my only plea&s;ure. Should my exertions procure the gratification of your wi&s;hes, I &s;hall con|&s;ider
<PB N="95" REF="96">
my trouble to be amply repaid. But let us lo&s;e no time. The liquor of which I &s;poke, is only to be found in St. Clare's laboratory. Ha&s;ten then to the priore&s;s, reque&s;t of her admi&s;&s;ion to the laboratory, and it will not be denied. There is a clo|&s;et at the lower end of the great room, fill|ed with liquids of different colours and qualities; the bottle in que&s;tion &s;tands by it&s;elf, upon the third &s;helf on the left. It contains a greeni&s;h liquor: fill a &s;mall phial with it when you are unob&s;erved, and An|tonia is your own."</P>
<P>The monk he&s;itated not to adopt this in|famous plan. His de&s;ires, but too violent before, had acquired fre&s;h vigour from the &s;ight of Antonia. As he &s;at by her bed-&s;ide, accident had di&s;covered to him &s;ome of tho&s;e charms which till then had been concealed from him: he found them even more perfect than his ardent imagination had pictured them. Sometimes her white and poli&s;hed arm was di&s;played in arrang|ing the pillow: &s;ometimes a &s;udden move|ment
<PB N="96" REF="97">
di&s;covered part of her &s;welling bo&s;om: but wherever the new-found charm pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf, there re&s;ted the friar's gloating eyes. Scarcely could he ma&s;ter him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to conceal his de&s;ires from An|tonia and her vigilant duenna. Inflamed by the remembrance of the&s;e beauties, he entered into Matilda's &s;cheme without he|&s;itation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were matins over, than he bent his cour&s;e towards the convent of St. Clare; his arrival threw the whole &s;i&s;terhood into the utmo&s;t amazement. The priore&s;s was &s;en|&s;ible of the honour done her convent by his paying it his fir&s;t vi&s;it, and &s;trove to expre&s;s her gratitude by every po&s;&s;ible attention. He was paraded through the garden, &s;hewn all the reliques of &s;aints and martyrs, and treated with as much re&s;pect and di&s;tinc|tion as had he been the Pope him&s;elf. On his part, Ambro&s;io received the domi|na's civilities very graciou&s;ly, and &s;trove to remove her &s;urpri&s;e at his having broken through his re&s;olution. He &s;tated
<PB N="97" REF="98">
that among his penitents, illne&s;s prevented many from quitting their hou&s;es. The&s;e were exactly the people who mo&s;t needed his advice and the comforts of religion. Many repre&s;entations had been made to him upon this account, and, though highly repugnant to his own wi&s;hes, he had found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ervice of Heaven, to change his determination, and quit his beloved retirement. The priore&s;s applauded his zeal in his profe&s;&s;ion, and his charity towards mankind. She declared that Madrid was happy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a man &s;o perfect and irreproachable. In &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e the friar at length reached the labo|ratory: he found the clo&s;et; the bottle &s;tood in the place which Matilda had de|&s;cribed, and the monk &s;eized an opportu|nity to fill his phial unob&s;erved with the &s;o|porific liquor. Then, having partaken of a collation in the refectory, he retired from the convent, plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it, and leaving the nuns delighted by the honour conferred upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">He waited till evening before he took the road to Antonia's dwelling. Jacintha welcomed him with tran&s;port, and be&s;ought him not to forget his promi&s;e to pa&s;s the night in the haunted chamber. That pro|mi&s;e he now repeated. He found Antonia tolerably well, but &s;till harping upon the gho&s;t's prediction. Flora moved not from her lady's bed, and, by &s;ymptoms yet &s;tronger than on the former night, te&s;tified her di&s;like to the abbot's pre&s;ence. Still Ambro&s;io affected not to ob&s;erve them. The phy&s;ician arrived while he was conver&s;ing with Antonia. It was dark already; lights were called for, and Flora was compelled to de&s;cend for them her&s;elf. However, as &s;he left a third per&s;on in the room, and ex|pected to be ab&s;ent but a few minutes, &s;he believed that &s;he ri&s;qued nothing in quit|ting her po&s;t. No &s;ooner had &s;he left the room, than Ambro&s;io moved towards the table, on which &s;tood Antonia's medicine. It was placed in a rece&s;s of the window. The phy&s;ician, &s;eated in an arm chair, and
<PB N="99" REF="100">
employed in que&s;tioning his patient, paid no attention to the proceedings of the monk. Ambro&s;io &s;eized the opportunity; he drew out the fatal phial, and let a few drops fall into the medicine: he then ha&s;tily left the table, and returned to the &s;eat which he had quitted. When Flora made her ap|pearance with lights, every thing &s;eemed to be exactly as &s;he had left it.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician declared that Antonia might quit her chamber the next day with perfect &s;afety. He recommended her fol|lowing the &s;ame pre&s;cription which on the night before had procured her a refre&s;hing &s;leep. Flora replied, that the draught &s;tood ready upon the table: he advi&s;ed the pati|ent to take it without delay, and then re|tired. Flora poured the medicine into a cup, and pre&s;ented it to her mi&s;tre&s;s. At that moment Ambro&s;io's courage failed him. Might not Matilda have deceived him? Might not jealou&s;y have per&s;uaded her to de&s;troy her rival, and &s;ub&s;titute poi|&s;on in the room of an opiate? This idea
<PB N="100" REF="101">
appeared &s;o rea&s;onable, that he was on the point of preventing her from &s;wallowing the medicine. His re&s;olution was adopted too late. The cup was already emptied, and Antonia re&s;tored it into Flora's hands. No remedy was now to be found; Ambro|&s;io could only expect the moment impati|ently de&s;tined to decide upon Antonia's life or death, upon his own happine&s;s or de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Dreading to create &s;u&s;picion by his &s;tay, or betray him&s;elf by his mind's agitation, he took leave of his victim, and withdrew from the room. Antonia parted from him with le&s;s cordiality than on the former night. Flora had repre&s;ented to her mi&s;|tre&s;s, that to admit his vi&s;its was to di&s;obey her mother's orders. She de&s;cribed to her his emotion on entering the room, and the fire which &s;parkled in his eyes while he gazed upon her. This had e&s;caped An|tonia's ob&s;ervation, but not her attendant's, who, explaining the monk's de&s;igns, and their probable con&s;equences, in terms much
<PB N="101" REF="102">
clearer than Elvira's, though not quite &s;o delicate, had &s;ucceeded in alarming her young lady, and per&s;uading her to treat him more di&s;tantly than &s;he had done hi|therto. The idea of obeying her mother's will at once determined Antonia. Though &s;he grieved at lo&s;ing his &s;ociety, &s;he con|quered her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to receive the monk with &s;ome degree of re&s;erve and cold|ne&s;s. She thanked him with re&s;pect and gratitude for his former vi&s;its, but did not invite his repeating them in future. It now was not the friar's intere&s;t to &s;olicit admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence, and he took leave of her as if not de&s;igning to return. Fully per&s;uaded that the acquaintance which &s;he dreaded was now at an end, Flora was &s;o much worked upon by his ea&s;y com|pliance, that &s;he began to doubt the ju&s;tice of her &s;u&s;picions. As &s;he lighted him down &s;tairs, &s;he thanked him for having endea|voured to root out from Antonia's mind her &s;uper&s;titious terrors of the &s;pectre's pre|diction: &s;he added, that as he &s;eemed in|tere&s;ted
<PB N="102" REF="103">
in Donna Antonia's welfare, &s;hould any change take place in her &s;ituation, &s;he would be careful to let him know it. The monk, in replying, took pains to rai&s;e his voice, hoping that Jacintha would hear it. In this he &s;ucceeded. As he reached the foot of the &s;tairs with his conductre&s;s, the landlady failed not to make her appear|ance.</P>
<P>"Why &s;urely you are not going away, reverend father?" cried &s;he: "Did you not promi&s;e to pa&s;s the night in the haunted chamber? Chri&s;t Je&s;us! I &s;hall be left alone with the gho&s;t, and a fine pickle I &s;hall be in by morning! Do all I could, &s;ay all I could, that ob&s;tinate old brute, Simon Gon|zalez, refu&s;ed to marry me to-day; and be|fore to-morrow comes, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall be torn to pieces by the gho&s;ts and goblins, and devils, and what not! For God's &s;ake, your holine&s;s, do not leave me in &s;uch a woful condition! On my bended knees I be&s;eech you to keep your promi&s;e: watch this night in the haunted chamber; lay the
<PB N="103" REF="104">
apparition in the red &s;ea, and Jacintha re|members you in her prayers to the la&s;t day of her exi&s;tence!"</P>
<P>This reque&s;t Ambro&s;io expected and de|&s;ired; yet he affected to rai&s;e objections, and to &s;eem unwilling to keep his word. He told Jacintha that the gho&s;t exi&s;ted no where but in her own brain, and that her in&s;i&s;ting upon his &s;taying all night in the hou&s;e was ridiculous and u&s;ele&s;s. Jacintha was ob&s;tinate; &s;he was not to be convinced, and pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o urgently not to leave her a prey to the devil, that at length he granted her reque&s;t. All this &s;how of re|&s;i&s;tance impo&s;ed not upon Flora, who was naturally of a &s;u&s;picious temper. She &s;u&s;|pected the monk to be acting a part very contrary to his own inclinations, and that he wi&s;hed for no better than to remain where he was. She even went &s;o far as to believe that Jacintha was in his intere&s;t; and the poor old woman was immediately &s;et down as no better than a procure&s;s. While &s;he applauded her&s;elf for having pe|netrated
<PB N="104" REF="105">
into this plot again&s;t her lady's honour, &s;he re&s;olved in &s;ecret to render it fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>"So then," &s;aid &s;he to the abbot with a look half &s;atirical and half indignant&mdash;"&s;o then you mean to &s;tay here to-night? Do &s;o, in God's name! Nobody will prevent you. Sit up to watch for the gho&s;t's arrival: I &s;hall &s;it up too, and the Lord grant that I may &s;ee nothing wor&s;e than a gho&s;t! I quit not Donna Antonia's bed-&s;ide during this ble&s;&s;ed night. Let me &s;ee any one dare to enter the room, and be he mortal or immortal, be he gho&s;t, devil, or man, I warrant his repenting that ever he cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold!"</P>
<P>This hint was &s;ufficiently &s;trong, and Ambro&s;io under&s;tood its meaning. But in&s;tead of &s;hewing that he perceived her &s;u&s;picions, he replied mildly, that he ap|proved the duenna's precautions, and ad|vi&s;ed her to per&s;evere in her intention. This &s;he a&s;&s;ured him faithfully that he might depend upon her doing. Jacintha
<PB N="105" REF="106">
then conducted him into the chamber where the gho&s;t had appeared, and Flora returned to her lady's.</P>
<P>Jacintha opened the door of the haunted room with a trembling hand; &s;he ventured to peep in, but the wealth of India would not have tempted her to cro&s;s the thre&s;hold. She gave the taper to the monk, wi&s;hed him well through the adventure, and ha&s;t|ened to be gone. Ambro&s;io entered. He bolted the door, placed the light upon the table, and &s;eated him&s;elf in the chair which on the former night had &s;u&s;tained Antonia. In &s;pite of Matilda's a&s;&s;urances, that the &s;pectre was a mere creation of fancy, his mind was impre&s;&s;ed with a certain my&s;te|rious horror. He in vain endeavoured to &s;hake it off. The &s;ilence of the night, the &s;tory of the apparition, the chamber wain|&s;cotted with dark oak pannels, the recol|lection which it brought with it of the murdered Elvira, and his incertitude re|&s;pecting the nature of the drops given by him to Antonia, made him feel unea&s;y at
<PB N="106" REF="107">
his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. But he thought much le&s;s of the &s;pectre than of the poi&s;on. Should he have de&s;troyed the only object which rendered life dear to him; &s;hould the gho&s;t's prediction prove true; &s;hould Antonia in three days be no more, and he the wretched cau&s;e of her death . . . . . . The &s;uppo&s;ition was too horrible to dwell upon. He drove away the&s;e dreadful images, and as often they pre&s;ented them|&s;elves again before him. Matilda had a&s;|&s;ured him that the effects of the opiate would be &s;peedy. He li&s;tened with fear, yet with eagerne&s;s, expecting to hear &s;ome di&s;turbance in the adjoining chamber. All was &s;till &s;ilent. He concluded that the drops had not begun to operate. Great was the &s;take for which he now played: a moment would &s;uffice to decide upon his mi&s;ery or happine&s;s. Matilda had taught him the means of a&s;certaining, that life was not extinct for ever: upon this a&s;&s;ay de|pended all his hopes. With every in|&s;tant his impatience redoubled; his terrors

grew more lively, his anxiety more awake. Unable to bear this &s;tate of incertitude, he endeavoured to divert it by &s;ub&s;tituting the thoughts of others to his own. The books, as was before mentioned, were ranged upon &s;helves near the table: this &s;tood exactly oppo&s;ite to the bed, which was placed in an alcove near the clo&s;et-door. Ambro&s;io took down a volume, and &s;eated him&s;elf by the table: but his attention wandered from the pages before him. Antonia's image, and that of the murdered Elvira, per&s;i&s;ted to force them&s;elves before his imagination. Still he continued to rend, though his eyes ran over the characters without his mind being con&s;cious of their import.</P>
<P>Such was his occupation when he fan|cied that he heard a foot-&s;tep. He turned his head, but nobody was to be &s;een. He re&s;umed his book; but in a few minutes af|ter, the &s;ame &s;ound was repeated, and fol|lowed by a ru&s;tling noi&s;e clo&s;e behind him. He now &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and looking round him, perceived the clo&s;et-door &s;tand|ing
<PB N="108" REF="109">
half unclo&s;ed. On his fir&s;t entering the room, he had tried to open it, but found it bolted on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>"How is this?" &s;aid he to him&s;elf; "How comes this door unfa&s;tened?"</P>
<P>He advanced towards it, he pu&s;hed it open, and looked into the clo&s;et: no one was there. While he &s;tood irre&s;olute, he thought that he di&s;tingui&s;hed a groaning in the adjacent chamber: it was Antonia's, and he &s;uppo&s;ed that the drops began to take effect. But upon li&s;tening more at|tentively, he found the noi&s;e to be cau&s;ed by Jacintha, who had fallen a&s;leep by the lady's bed-&s;ide, and was &s;noaring mo&s;t lu&s;|tily. Ambro&s;io drew back, and returned to the other room, mu&s;ing upon the &s;ud|den opening of the clo&s;et-door, for which he &s;trove in vain to account.</P>
<P>He paced the chamber up and down in &s;ilence. At length he &s;topped, and the bed attracted his attention. The curtain of the rece&s;s was but half drawn. He &s;igh|ed involuntarily.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">"That bed," &s;aid he in a low voice, "that bed was Elvira's! There has &s;he pa&s;&s;ed many a quiet night, for &s;he was good and innocent. How &s;ound mu&s;t have been her &s;leep! and yet now &s;he &s;leeps &s;ounder? Does &s;he indeed &s;leep? Oh! God grant that &s;he may! What if &s;he ro&s;e from her grave at this &s;ad and &s;ilent hour? What if &s;he broke the bonds of the tomb, and glided angrily before my bla&s;ted eyes? Oh! I never could &s;upport the &s;ight! Again to &s;ee her form di&s;torted by dying agonies, her blood-&s;wollen veins, her livid countenance, her eyes bur&s;ting from their &s;ockets with pain!&mdash;to hear her &s;peak of future puni&s;h|ment, menace me with Heaven's vengeance, tax me with the crimes I have committed, with tho&s;e I am going to commit . . . . . Great God! what is that?"</P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e words, his eyes, which were fixed upon the bed, &s;aw the curtain &s;haken gently backwards and forwards. The apparition was recalled to his mind, and he almo&s;t fancied that he beheld El|vira's
<PB N="110" REF="111">
vi&s;ionary form reclining upon the bed. A few moments con&s;ideration &s;ufficed to re-a&s;&s;ure him.</P>
<P>"It was only the wind," &s;aid he, recover|ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Again he paced the chamber; but an in|voluntary movement of awe and inquietude con&s;tantly led his eye towards the alcove. He drew near it with irre&s;olution. He pau&s;ed before he a&s;cended the few &s;teps which led to it. He put out his hand thrice to remove the curtain, and as often drew it back.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd terrors!" He cried at length, a&s;hamed of his own weakne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily he mounted the &s;teps, when a figure dre&s;&s;ed in white &s;tarted from the al|cove, and gliding by him, made with pre|cipitation towards the clo&s;et. Madne&s;s and de&s;pair now &s;upplied the monk with that courage, of which he had till then been de|&s;titute. He flew down the &s;teps, pur&s;ued the apparition, and attempted to gra&s;p it.</P>
<P>"Gho&s;t, or devil, I hold you!" he
<PB N="111" REF="112">
exclaimed, and &s;eized the &s;pectre by the arm.</P>
<P>"Oh! Chri&s;t Je&s;us!" cried a &s;hrill voice; "Holy father, how you gripe me! I pro|te&s;t that I meant no harm!"</P>
<P>This addre&s;s, as well as the arm which he held, convinced the abbot that the &s;up|po&s;ed gho&s;t was &s;ub&s;tantial fle&s;h and blood. He drew the intruder towards the table, and holding up the light, di&s;covered the features of . . . . . . Madona Flora!</P>
<P>Incen&s;ed at having been betrayed by this trifling cau&s;e into fears &s;o ridiculous, he a&s;ked her &s;ternly, what bu&s;ine&s;s had brought her to that chamber. Flora, a&s;hamed at being found out, and terrified at the &s;eve|rity of Ambro&s;io's looks, fell upon her knees, and promi&s;ed to make a full con|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t, reverend father," &s;aid &s;he, "that I am quite grieved at having di&s;|turbed you; nothing was further from my intention. I meant to get out of the room as quietly as I got in; and had you been
<PB N="112" REF="113">
ignorant that I watched you, you know it would have been the &s;ame thing as if I had not watched you at all. To be &s;ure I did very wrong in being a &s;py upon you&mdash;that I cannot deny. But, Lord! your reverence, how can a poor weak woman re&s;i&s;t curi|o&s;ity? Mine was &s;o &s;trong to know what you were doing, that I could not but try to get a little peep without any body know|ing any thing about it. So with that I left old Dame Jacintha &s;itting by my lady's bed, and I ventured to &s;teal into the clo&s;et. Being unwilling to interrupt you, I con|tented my&s;elf at fir&s;t with putting my eye to the key-hole; but as I could &s;ee nothing by this means, I undrew the bolt, and while your back was turned to the alcove, I whipt me in &s;oftly and &s;ilently. Here I lay &s;nug behind the curtain, till your reve|rence found me out, and &s;eized me ere I had time to regain the clo&s;et-door. This is the whole truth, I a&s;&s;ure you, holy father, and I beg your pardon a thou&s;and times for my impertinence."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">During this &s;peech the abbot had time to recollect him&s;elf: he was &s;atisfied with reading the penitent &s;py a lecture upon the dangers of curio&s;ity, and the meanne&s;s of the action in which &s;he had been ju&s;t di&s;|covered. Flora declared her&s;elf fully per|&s;uaded that &s;he had done wrong; &s;he pro|mi&s;ed never to be guilty of the &s;ame fault again, and was retiring very humble and contrite to Antonia's chamber, when the clo&s;et-door was &s;uddenly thrown open, and in ru&s;hed Jacintha pale and out of breath.</P>
<P>"Oh! Father! Father!" &s;he cried in a voice almo&s;t choked with terror, "What &s;hall I do! What &s;hall I do! Here is a fine piece of work! Nothing but misfor|tunes! Nothing but dead people, and dy|ing people! Oh! I &s;hall go di&s;tracted! I &s;hall go di&s;tracted!"</P>
<P>"Speak! Speak!" cried Flora and the monk at the &s;ame time; "what has hap|pened? what is the matter?</P>
<P>"Oh! I &s;hall have another cor&s;e in my hou&s;e! Some witch has certainly ca&s;t a &s;pell

upon it, upon me, and upon all about me! Poor Donna Antonia! there &s;he lies in ju&s;t &s;uch convul&s;ions as killed her mother! The gho&s;t told her true! I am &s;ure the gho&s;t told her true!"</P>
<P>Flora ran, or rather &s;lew to her lady's chamber: Ambro&s;io followed her, his bo|&s;om trembling with hope and apprehen&s;ion. They found Antonia as Jacintha had de|&s;cribed, torn by racking convul&s;ions, from which they in vain endeavoured to relieve her. The monk di&s;patched Jacintha to the abbey in all ha&s;te, and commi&s;&s;ioned her to bring father Pablos back with her with|out lo&s;ing a moment.</P>
<P>"I will go for him," replied Jacintha, "and tell him to come hither; but as to bringing him my&s;elf, I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. I am &s;ure that the hou&s;e is bewitched, and burn me if ever I &s;et foot in it again."</P>
<P>With this re&s;olution &s;he &s;et out for the mona&s;tery, and delivered to father Pablos the abbot's orders. She then betook her&s;elf to the hou&s;e of old Simon Gonzalez, whom
<PB N="115" REF="116">
&s;he re&s;olved never to quit till &s;he had made him her hu&s;band, and his dwelling her own.</P>
<P>Father Pablos had no &s;ooner beheld An|tonia, than he pronounced her incurable. The convul&s;ions continued for an hour; during that time her agonies were much milder than tho&s;e which her groans created in the abbot's heart. Her every pang &s;eemed a dagger in his bo&s;om, and he cur&s;ed him&s;elf a thou&s;and times for having adopted &s;o barbarous a project. The hour being expired, by degrees the fits became le&s;s frequent, and Antonia le&s;s agitated. She felt that her di&s;&s;olution was approach|ing, and that nothing could &s;ave her.</P>
<P>"Worthy Ambro&s;io," &s;he &s;aid in a fee|ble voice, while &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand to her lips; "I am now at liberty to expre&s;s how grateful is my heart for your attention and kindne&s;s. I am upon the bed of death; yet an hour, and I &s;hall be no more. I may therefore acknowledge without re&s;traint, that to relinqui&s;h your &s;ociety was very painful to me: but &s;uch was the will of a
<PB N="116" REF="117">
parent, and I dared not di&s;obey. I die with|out repugnance: there are few who will la|ment my leaving them&mdash;there are few whom I lament to leave. Among tho&s;e few, I lament for none more than for your&s;elf; but we &s;hall meet again, Ambro&s;io! we &s;hall one day meet in heaven: there &s;hall our friend&s;hip be renewed, and my mother &s;hall view it with plea&s;ure!"</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. The abbot &s;huddered when &s;he mentioned Elvira. Antonia imputed his emotion to pity and concern for her.</P>
<P>"You are grieved for me, father," &s;he continued; "Ah! &s;igh not for my lo&s;s. I have no crimes to repent, at lea&s;t none of which I am con&s;cious; and I re&s;tore my &s;oul without fear to him from whom I re|ceived it. I have but few reque&s;ts to make; yet let me hope that what few I have &s;hall be granted. Let a &s;olemn ma&s;s be &s;aid for my &s;oul's repo&s;e, and another for that or my beloved mother; not that I doubt her re&s;ting in her grave. I am now con|vinced that my rea&s;on wandered, and the
<PB N="117" REF="118">
fal&s;ehood of the gho&s;t's prediction is &s;uf|ficient to prove my error. But every one has &s;ome failing: my mother may have had her's, though I knew them not: I there|fore wi&s;h a ma&s;s to be celebrated for her repo&s;e, and the expence may be defrayed by the little wealth of which I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed. Whatever may then remain, I be|queath to my aunt Leonella. When I am dead, let the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas know that his brother's unhappy family can no longer importune him. But di&s;ap|pointment makes me unju&s;t: they tell me that he is ill, and perhaps, had it been in his power, he wi&s;hed to have protected me. Tell him, then, father, only that I am dead, and that if he had any faults to me, I forgave him from my heart. This done, I have nothing more to a&s;k for than your prayers. Promi&s;e to remember my re|que&s;ts, and I &s;hall re&s;ign my life without a pang or &s;orrow."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io engaged to comply with her de&s;ires, and proceeded to give her ab&s;o|lution.
<PB N="118" REF="119">
Every moment announced the ap|proach of Antonia's fate. Her &s;ight failed, her heart beat &s;luggi&s;hly, her fingers &s;tif|fened and grew cold, and at two in the morning &s;he expired without a groan. As &s;oon as the breath had for&s;aken her body, father Pablos retired, &s;incerely affected at the melancholy &s;cene. On her part, Flora gave way to the mo&s;t unbridled &s;orrow. Far different concerns employed Ambro|&s;io; he &s;ought for the pul&s;e who&s;e throb|bing, &s;o Matilda had a&s;&s;ured him, would prove Antonia's death but temporal. He found it&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed it&mdash;it palpitated be|neath his hand, and his heart was filled with ec&s;tacy. However, he carefully con|cealed his &s;atisfaction at the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan. He a&s;&s;umed a melancholy air, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Flora, warned her again&s;t abandoning her&s;elf to fruitle&s;s &s;or|row. Her tears were too-&s;incere to permit her li&s;tening to his coun&s;els, and &s;he con|tinued to weep uncea&s;ingly. The friar withdrew, fir&s;t promi&s;ing to give orders
<PB N="119" REF="120">
him&s;elf about the funeral, which, out of con&s;ideration for Jacintha as he pretended, &s;hould take place with all expedition. Plunged in grief for the lo&s;s of her beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, Flora &s;carcely attended to what he &s;aid. Ambro&s;io ha&s;tened to command the burial. He obtained permi&s;&s;ion from the priore&s;s, that the cor&s;e &s;hould be depo|&s;ited in St. Clare's &s;epulchre: and on the Friday morning, every proper and needful ceremony being performed, Antonia's body was committed to the tomb.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day Leonella arrived at Madrid, intending to pre&s;ent her young hu&s;band to Elvira. Various circum&s;tances had obliged her to defer her journey from Tue&s;day to Friday; and &s;he had no op|portunity of making this alteration in her plans known to her &s;i&s;ter. As her heart was truly affectionate, and as &s;he had ever entertained a &s;incere regard for Elvira and her daughter, her &s;urpri&s;e at hearing of their &s;udden and melancholy fate was fully equal|led by her &s;orrow and di&s;appointment.

Ambro&s;io &s;ent to inform her of Antonia's beque&s;t: at her &s;olication, he promi&s;ed, as &s;oon as Elvira's trifling debts were di&s;|charged, to tran&s;mit to her the remainder. This being &s;ettled, no other bu&s;ine&s;s de|tained Leonella in Madrid, and &s;he re|turned to Cordova with all diligence.</P>

<P>HIS whole attention bent upon bringing to ju&s;tice the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his &s;i&s;ter, Lorenzo little thought how &s;everely his intere&s;t was &s;uffering in another quarter. As was before mentioned, he returned not to Madrid till the evening of that day on which Antonia was buried. Signifying to the Grand In|qui&s;itor the order of the cardinal-duke (a ceremony not to be neglected when a mem|ber of the church was to be arre&s;ted pub|licly), communicating his de&s;ign to his un|cle
<PB N="122" REF="123">
and Don Ramirez, and a&s;&s;embling a troop of attendants &s;ufficient to prevent op|po&s;ition, furni&s;hed him with full occupation during the few hours preceding midnight. Con&s;equently he had no opportunity to enquire about his mi&s;tre&s;s, and was perfectly ignorant both of her death and her mo|ther's.</P>
<P>The marquis was by no means out of danger: his delirium was gone, but had left him &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that the phy|&s;icians declined pronouncing upon the con|&s;equences likely to en&s;ue. As for Raymond him&s;elf, he wi&s;hed for nothing more ear|ne&s;tly than to join Agnes in the grave. Ex|i&s;tence was hateful to him: he &s;aw nothing in the world de&s;erving his attention; and he hoped to hear that Agnes was revenged and him&s;elf given over in the &s;ame moment.</P>
<P>Followed by Raymond's ardent prayers for &s;ucce&s;s, Lorenzo was at the gates of St. Clare a full hour before the time ap|pointed by the Mother St. Ur&s;ula. He was accompanied by his uncle, by Don
<PB N="123" REF="124">
Ramirez de Mello, and a party of cho&s;en archers. Though in con&s;iderable numbers, their appearance created no &s;urpri&s;e: a great crowd was already a&s;&s;embled before the convent-doors, in order to witne&s;s the proce&s;&s;ion. It was naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that Lorenzo and his attendants were conducted thither by the &s;ame de&s;ign. The duke of Medina being recogni&s;ed, the people drew back, and made way for his party to ad|vance. Lorenzo placed him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the great gate, through which the pil|grims were to pa&s;s. Convinced that the priore&s;s could not e&s;cape him, he waited patiently for her appearance, which &s;he was expected to make exactly at midnight.</P>
<P>The nuns were employed in religious duties e&s;tabli&s;hed in honour of St. Clare, and to which no prophane was ever ad|mitted. The chapel-windows were illu|minated. As they &s;tood on the out&s;ide, the auditors heard the full &s;well of the or|gan, accompanied by a chorus of female voices, ri&s;e upon the &s;tillne&s;s of the night.
<PB N="124" REF="125">
This died away, and was &s;ucceeded by a &s;ingle &s;train of harmony: it was the voice of her who was de&s;tined to &s;u&s;tain in the proce&s;&s;ion the character of St. Clare. For this office the mo&s;t beautiful virgin of Ma|drid was always &s;elected, and &s;he upon whom the choice fell, e&s;teemed it as the highe&s;t of honours. While li&s;tening to the mu&s;ic, who&s;e melody di&s;tance only &s;eemed to render &s;weeter, the audience was wrapped up in profound attention. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed through the crowd, and every heart was filled with reverence for religion &mdash;every heart but Lorenzo's. Con&s;cious that among tho&s;e who chaunted the prai&s;es of their God &s;o &s;weetly there were &s;ome who cloaked with devotion the foule&s;t &s;ins, their hymns in&s;pired him with dete&s;tation at their hypocri&s;y. He had long ob&s;erved with di&s;|approbation and contempt the &s;uper&s;tition which governed Madrid's inhabitants. His good &s;en&s;e had pointed out to him the arti|fices of the monks, and the gro&s;s ab&s;urdity of their miracles, wonders, and &s;uppo&s;i|titious
<PB N="125" REF="126">
reliques. He blu&s;hed to &s;ee his countrymen the dupes of deceptions &s;o ri|diculous, and only wi&s;hed for an opportu|nity to free them from their monki&s;h fetters. That opportunity, &s;o long de&s;ired in vain, was at length pre&s;ented to him. He re|&s;olved not to let it &s;lip, but to &s;et before the people, in glaring colours, how enormous were the abu&s;es but too frequently practi&s;ed in mona&s;teries, and how unju&s;tly public e&s;teem was be&s;towed indi&s;criminately upon all who wore a religious habit. He longed for the moment de&s;tined to unma&s;k the hy|pocrites, and convince his countrymen, that a &s;anctified exterior does not always hide a virtuous heart.</P>
<P>The &s;ervice la&s;ted till midnight was an|nounced by the convent-bell. That &s;ound being heard, the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed: the voices died away &s;oftly, and &s;oon after the lights di&s;appeared from the chapel-windows. Lo|renzo's heart beat high, when he found the execution of his plan to be at hand. From the natural &s;uper&s;tition of the people he
<PB N="126" REF="127">
had prepared him&s;elf for &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance: but he tru&s;ted that the Mother St. Ur&s;ula would bring good rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify his pro|ceeding. He had force with him to repel the fir&s;t impul&s;e of the populace, till his ar|guments &s;hould be heard: his only fear was, le&s;t the domina, &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, &s;hould have &s;pirited away the nun on who&s;e depo&s;ition every thing depended. Unle&s;s the Mother St. Ur&s;ula &s;hould be pre&s;ent, he could only accu&s;e the priore&s;s upon &s;u&s;|picion; and this reflection gave him &s;ome little apprehen&s;ion for the &s;ucce&s;s of his en|terpri&s;e. The tranquillity which &s;eemed to reign through the convent, in &s;ome degree re-a&s;&s;ured him: &s;till he expected the mo|ment eagerly, when the pre&s;ence of his ally &s;hould deprive him of the power of doubt|ing.</P>
<P>The abbey of Capuchins was only &s;epa|rated from the convent by the garden and cemetery. The monks had been invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the pilgrimage. They now ar|rived, marching two by two with lighted
<PB N="127" REF="128">
torches in their hands, and chaunting hymns in honour of St. Clare. Father Pablos was at their head, the abbot hav|ing excu&s;ed him&s;elf from attending. The people made way for the holy train, and the friars placed them&s;elves in ranks on either &s;ide of the great gates. A few minutes &s;uf|ficed to arrange the order of the proce&s;&s;ion. This being &s;ettled, the convent-doors were thrown open, and again the female chorus &s;ounded in full melody. Fir&s;t appeared a band of chori&s;ters. As &s;oon as they had pa&s;&s;ed, the monks fell in two by two, and followed with &s;teps &s;low and mea&s;ured: next came the novices: they bore no tapers, as did the profe&s;&s;ed, but moved on with eyes bent downwards, and &s;eemed to be occu|pied by telling their beads. To them &s;uc|ceeded a young and lovely girl, who repre|&s;ented St. Lucia: &s;he held a golden ba&s;on, in which were two eyes: her own were co|vered by a velvet bandage, and &s;he was conducted by another nun habited as an angel. She was followed by St. Catherine,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
a palm-branch in one hand, a flaming &s;word in the other: &s;he was robed in white, and her brow was ornamented with a &s;park|ling diadem. After her appeared St. Ge|nevieve, &s;urrounded by a number of imps, who putting them&s;elves into grote&s;que atti|tudes, drawing her by the robe, and &s;porting round her with antic ge&s;tures, endeavoured to di&s;tract her attention from the book, on which her eyes were con&s;tantly fixed. The&s;e merry devils greatly entertained the &s;pectators, who te&s;tified their plea&s;ure by repeated bur&s;ts of laughter. The priore&s;s had been careful to &s;elect a nun who&s;e di&s;|po&s;ition was naturally &s;olemn and &s;atur|nine. She had every rea&s;on to be &s;ati&s;|fied with her choice: the drolleries of the imps were entirely thrown away, and St. Genevieve moved on without di&s;compo&s;ing a mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e &s;aints was &s;eparated from the other by a band of chori&s;ters, exalting her prai&s;e in their hymns, but declaring her to be very much inferior to St. Clare,
<PB N="129" REF="130">
the convent's avowed patrone&s;s. The&s;e having pa&s;&s;ed, a long train of nuns ap|peared, bearing like the chori&s;ters each a burning taper. Next came the reliques of St. Clare, inclo&s;ed in va&s;es equally precious for their materials and workman&s;hip: but they attracted not Lorenzo's attention. The nun who bore the heart occupied him en|tirely. According to Theodore's de&s;crip|tion, he doubted not her being the Mother St. Ur&s;ula. She &s;eemed to look round with anxiety. As he &s;tood foremo&s;t in the rank by which the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed, her eye caught Lorenzo's. A flu&s;h of joy over-&s;pread her till then pallid cheek. She turned to her companion eagerly.</P>
<P>"We are &s;afe," he heard her whi&s;per, "'tis her brother."</P>
<P>His heart being now at ea&s;e, Lorenzo gazed with tranquillity upon the remainder of the &s;how. Now appeared its mo&s;t bril|liant ornament: it was a machine fa&s;hioned like a throne, rich with jewels, and dazzling with light. It rolled onwards upon con|cealed

wheels, and was guided by &s;everal lovely children dre&s;&s;ed as &s;eraphs. The &s;ummit was covered with &s;ilver clouds, upon which reclined the mo&s;t beautiful form that eyes ever witne&s;&s;ed. It was a dam&s;el repre&s;enting St. Clare: her dre&s;s was of ine&s;timable price, and round her head a wreath of diamonds formed an arti|ficial glory: but all the&s;e ornaments yielded to the lu&s;tre of her charms. As &s;he ad|vanced, a murmur of delight ran through the crowd. Even Lorenzo confe&s;&s;ed &s;e|cretly, that he never beheld more perfect beauty; and had not his heart been Anto|nia's, it mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to this enchanting girl. As it was, he con&s;idered her only as a fine &s;tatue: &s;he obtained from him no tribute &s;ave cold admiration; and when &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed him, he thought of her no more.</P>
<P>"Who is &s;he?" a&s;ked a by-&s;tander in Lorenzo's hearing.</P>
<P>"One who&s;e beauty you mu&s;t often have heard celebrated. Her name is Virginia

<P>The throne moved onwards. It was fol|lowed by the priore&s;s her&s;elf: &s;he marched at the head of the remaining nuns with a devout and &s;anctified air, and clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion. She moved on &s;lowly: her eyes were rai&s;ed to heaven: her counte|nance, calm and tranquil, &s;eemed ab&s;tracted from all &s;ublunary things, and no feature betrayed her &s;ecret pride at di&s;playing the pomp and opulence of her convent. She pa&s;&s;ed along, accompanied by the prayers and benedictions of the populace: but how great was the general confu&s;ion and &s;ur|pri&s;e when Don Ramirez, &s;tarting forward, challenged her as his pri&s;oner!</P>
<P>For a moment amazement held the do|mina &s;ilent and immoveable: but no &s;ooner did &s;he recover her&s;elf, than &s;he exclaimed again&s;t &s;acrilege and impiety, and called upon the people to re&s;cue a daughter of the

church. They were eagerly preparing to obey her; when Don Ramirez, protected by the archers from their rage, commanded them to forbear, and threatened them with the &s;evere&s;t vengeance of the Inqui&s;ition. At that dreaded word every arm fell, every &s;word &s;hrunk back into its &s;cabbard. The priore&s;s her&s;elf turned pale, and trembled. The general &s;ilence convinced her that &s;he had nothing to hope but from innocence, and &s;he be&s;ought Don Ramirez in a fault|ering voice, to inform her of what crime &s;he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"That you &s;hall know in time," replied he; "but fir&s;t I mu&s;t &s;ecure the Mother St. Ur&s;ula."</P>
<P>"The Mother St. Ur&s;ula?" repeated the domina faintly.</P>
<P>At this moment ca&s;ting her eyes round, &s;he &s;aw Lorenzo and the duke, who had followed Don Ramirez.</P>
<P>"Ah! great God!" &s;he cried, cla&s;ping her hands together with a frantic air, "I am betrayed."</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">"Betrayed?" replied St. Ur&s;ula, who now arrived conducted by &s;ome of the archers, and followed by the nun her com|panion in the proce&s;&s;ion: "not betrayed, but di&s;covered. In me recogni&s;e your accu&s;er: you know not how well I am in|&s;tructed in your guilt:&mdash;Segnor," &s;he con|tinued, turning to Don Ramirez, "I com|mit my&s;elf to your cu&s;tody. I charge the priore&s;s of St. Clare with murder, and &s;take my life for the ju&s;tice of my accu&s;ation."</P>
<P>A general cry of &s;urpri&s;e was uttered by the whole audience, and an explanation was loudly demanded. The trembling nuns, terrified at the noi&s;e and univer&s;al confu|&s;ion, had di&s;per&s;ed, and fled different ways. Some regained the convent: others &s;ought refuge in the dwellings of their relations; and many, only &s;en&s;ible of their pre&s;ent danger, and anxious to e&s;cape from the tu|mult, ran through the &s;treets, and wandered they knew not whither. The lovely Vir|ginia was one of the fir&s;t to fly. And in order that &s;he might be better &s;een and
<PB N="134" REF="135">
heard, the people de&s;ired that St. Ur&s;ula &s;hould harangue them from the vacant throne. The nun complied: &s;he a&s;cended the glittering machine, and then addre&s;&s;ed the &s;urrounding multitude as follows:</P>
<P>"However &s;trange and un&s;eemly may appear my conduct, when con&s;idered to be adopted by a female and a nun, nece&s;&s;ity will ju&s;tify it mo&s;t fully. A &s;ecret, an hor|rible &s;ecret weighs heavy upon my &s;oul: no re&s;t can be mine till I have revealed it to the world, and &s;atisfied that innocent blood which calls from the grave for venge|ance. Much have I dared, to gain this opportunity of lightening my con&s;cience. Had I failed in my attempt to reveal the crime, had the domina but &s;u&s;pected that the my&s;tery was none to me, my ruin was inevitable. Angels who watch uncea&s;ingly over tho&s;e who de&s;erve their favour, have enabled me to e&s;cape detection. I am now at liberty to relate a tale, who&s;e circum|&s;tances will freeze every hone&s;t &s;oul with horror. Mine is the ta&s;k to rend the veil

from hypocri&s;y, and &s;hew mi&s;guided pa|rents to what dangers the woman is ex|po&s;ed, who falls under the &s;way of a mo|na&s;tic tyrant.</P>
<P>"Among the votaries of St. Clare, none was more lovely, none more gentle, than Agnes de Medina. I knew her well: &s;he entru&s;ted to me every &s;ecret of her heart: I was her friend and confidante, and I loved her with &s;incere affection. Nor was I &s;ingular in my attachment. Her piety unfeigned, her willingne&s;s to oblige, and her angelic di&s;po&s;ition, rendered her the darling of all that was e&s;timable in the convent. The priore&s;s her&s;elf, proud, &s;cru|pulous and forbidding, could not refu&s;e Agnes that tribute of approbation which &s;he be&s;towed upon no one el&s;e. Every one has &s;ome fault. Alas! Agnes had her weak|ne&s;s: &s;he violated the laws of our order, and incurred the inveterate hate of the unforgiving domina. St. Clare's rules are &s;evere: but grown antiquated and neglected, many of late years have either been forgot|ten,
<PB N="136" REF="137">
or changed by univer&s;al con&s;ent into milder puni&s;hments. The penance adjudged to the crime of Agnes was mo&s;t cruel, mo&s;t inhuman. The law had been long explo|ded. Alas! it &s;till exi&s;ted, and the re|vengeful priore&s;s now determined to revive it. This law decreed, that the offender &s;hould be plunged into a private dungeon, expre&s;sly con&s;tituted to hide from the world for ever the victim of cruelty and tyrannic &s;uper&s;tition. In this dreadful abode &s;he was to lead a perpetual &s;olitude, deprived of all &s;ociety, and believed to be dead by tho&s;e, whom affection might have prompted to attempt her re&s;cue. Thus was &s;he to langui&s;h out the remainder of her days, with no other food than bread and water, and no other comfort than the free indulgence of her tears."</P>
<P>The indignation created by this account was &s;o violent, as for &s;ome moments to in|terrupt St. Ur&s;ula's narrative. When the di&s;turbance cea&s;ed, and &s;ilence again pre|vailed through the a&s;&s;embly, &s;he continued
<PB N="137" REF="138">
her di&s;cour&s;e, while at every word the do|mina's countenance betrayed her increa&s;ing terrors.</P>
<P>"A council of the twelve elder nuns was called: I was of the number. The prio|re&s;s in exaggerated colours de&s;cribed the offence of Agnes, and &s;crupled not to pro|po&s;e the revival of this almo&s;t forgotten law. To the &s;hame of our &s;ex be it &s;poken, that either &s;o ab&s;olute was the domina's will in the convent, or &s;o much had di&s;ap|pointment, &s;olitude, and &s;elf-denial harden|ed their hearts and &s;oured their tempers, that this barbarous propo&s;al was a&s;&s;ented to by nine voices out of the twelve. I was not one of the nine. Frequent opportunities had convinced me of the virtues of Agnes, and I loved and pitied her mo&s;t &s;incerely. The mothers Bertha and Cornelia joined my party: we made the &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ition, po&s;&s;ible, and the &s;uperior found her&s;elf compelled to change her intention. In &s;pite of the majority in her favour, &s;he feared to break with us openly. She knew
<PB N="138" REF="139">
that, &s;upported by the Medina family, our forces would be too &s;trong for her to cope with: and &s;he al&s;o knew that, after being once impri&s;oned, and &s;uppo&s;ed dead, &s;hould Agnes be di&s;covered, her ruin would be inevitable; &s;he therefore gave up her de|&s;ign, though with much reluctance. She demanded &s;ome days to reflect upon a mode of puni&s;hment, which might be agreeable to the whole community; and &s;he promi&s;ed, that as &s;oon as her re&s;olution was fixed, the &s;ame council &s;hould be again &s;ummoned. Two days pa&s;&s;ed away: on the evening of the third it was announced, that on the next day Agnes &s;hould be examined; and that according to her be|viour on that occa&s;ion her puni&s;hment &s;hould be either &s;trengthened or miti|gated.</P>
<P>"On the night preceding this exami|nation, I &s;tole to the cell of Agnes at an hour when I &s;uppo&s;ed the other nuns to be buried in &s;leep. I comforted her to the be&s;t of my power: I bade her take courage,
<PB N="139" REF="140">
told her to rely upon the &s;upport of her friends, and taught her certain &s;igns, by which I might in&s;truct her to an&s;wer the domina's que&s;tions by an a&s;&s;ent or negative. Con&s;cious that her enemy would &s;trive to confu&s;e, embarra&s;s, and daunt her, I feared her being en&s;nared into &s;ome confe&s;&s;ion prejudicial to her intere&s;ts. Being anxious to keep my vi&s;it &s;ecret. I &s;tayed with Agnes but a &s;hort time. I bade her not to let her &s;pirits be ca&s;t down. I mingled my tears with tho&s;e which &s;treamed down her cheek, embraced her fondly, and was on the point of retiring, when I heard the &s;ound of &s;teps approaching the cell. I &s;tarted back. A curtain which veiled a large crucifix of|fered me a retreat, and I ha&s;tened to place my&s;elf behind it. The door opened. The priore&s;s entered, followed by four other nuns. They advanced towards the bed of Agnes. The &s;uperior reproached her with her errors in the bittere&s;t terms. She told her, that &s;he was a di&s;grace to the convent, that &s;he was re&s;olved to deliver the world
<PB N="140" REF="141">
and her&s;elf from &s;uch a mon&s;ter, and com|manded her to drink the contents of a gob|let now pre&s;ented to her by one of the nuns. Aware of the fatal properties of the liquor, and trembling to find her&s;elf upon the brink of eternity, the unhappy girl &s;trove to excite the domina's pity by the mo&s;t af|fecting prayers. She &s;ued for life in terms which might have melted the heart of a fiend. She promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit patiently to any puni&s;hment, to &s;hame, impri&s;on|ment, and torture, might &s;he but be per|mitted to live! Oh! might &s;he but live another month, or week, or day! Her mer|cile&s;s enemy li&s;tened to her complaints un|moved: &s;he told her, that at fir&s;t &s;he meant to have &s;pared her life, and that if &s;he had altered her intention, &s;he had to thank the oppo&s;ition of her friends. She continued to in&s;i&s;t upon her &s;wallowing the poi&s;on: &s;he bade her recommend her&s;elf to the Al|mighty's mercy, not to hers; and a&s;&s;ured her that in an hour &s;he would be numbered with the dead. Perceiving that it was
<PB N="141" REF="142">
vain to implore this unfeeling woman, &s;he attempted to &s;pring from her bed, and call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: &s;he hoped, if &s;he could not e&s;cape the fate announced to her, at lea&s;t to have witne&s;&s;es of the violence commit|ted. The priore&s;s gue&s;&s;ed her de&s;ign: &s;he &s;eized her forcibly by the arm, and pu&s;hed her back upon her pillow; at the &s;ame time drawing a dagger, and placing it at the brea&s;t of the unfortunate Agnes, &s;he prote&s;ted that if &s;he uttered a &s;ingle cry, or he&s;itated a &s;ingle moment to drink the poi|&s;on, &s;he would pierce her heart that in|&s;tant. Already half-dead with fear, &s;he could make no further re&s;i&s;tance. The nun approached with the fatal goblet; the domina obliged her to take it, and &s;wallow the contents. She drank, and the horrid deed was accompli&s;hed. The nuns then &s;eated them&s;elves round the bed; they an|&s;wered her groans with reproaches; they interrupted with &s;arca&s;ms the prayers in which &s;he recommended her parting &s;oul to mercy: they threatened her with hea|ven's
<PB N="142" REF="143">
vengeance and eternal perdition: they bade her de&s;pair of pardon, and &s;trowed with yet &s;harper thorns death's painful pillow. Such were the &s;ufferings of this young unfortunate, till relea&s;ed by fate from the malice of her tormentors. She expired in horror of the pa&s;t, in fears for the future; and her agonies were &s;uch as mu&s;t have amply gratified the hate and vengeance of her enemies. As &s;oon as her victim cea&s;ed to breathe, the domina re|tired, and was followed by her accom|plices.</P>
<P>"It was now that I ventured from my con|cealment. I dared not to a&s;&s;i&s;t my unhap|py friend, aware that, without pre&s;erving her, I &s;hould only have brought on my&s;elf the &s;ame de&s;truction. Shocked and terri|fied beyond expre&s;&s;ion at this horrid &s;cene, &s;carcely had I &s;ufficient &s;trength to regain my cell. As I reached the door of that of Agnes, I ventured to look towards the bed on which lay her lifele&s;s body, once &s;o lovely and &s;o &s;weet! I breathed a prayer
<PB N="143" REF="144">
for her departed &s;pirit, and vowed to re|venge her death by the &s;hame and puni&s;h|ment of her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. With danger and difficulty I have kept my oath. I unwarily dropped &s;ome words at the funeral of Ag|nes, white thrown off my guard by exce&s;|&s;ive grief, which alarmed the guilty con|&s;cience of the priore&s;s. My every action was ob&s;erved; my every &s;tep was traced. I was con&s;tantly &s;urrounded by the &s;upe|rior's &s;pies. It was long before I could find the means of conveying to the unhap|py girl's relations an intimation of my &s;e|cret. It was given out, that Agnes had ex|pired &s;uddenly: this account was credited not only by her friends in Madrid, but even by tho&s;e within the convent. The poi&s;on had left no marks upon her body: no one &s;u&s;pected the true cau&s;e of her death, and it remained unknown to all, &s;ave the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I have no more to &s;ay; for what I have already &s;aid, I will an&s;wer with my life. I repeat, that the priore&s;s is a murdere&s;s; that
<PB N="144" REF="145">
&s;he has driven from the world, perhaps from heaven, an unfortunate, who&s;e offence was light and venial; that &s;he has abu&s;ed the power intru&s;ted to her hands, and has been a tyrant, a barbarian, and an hypo|crite. I al&s;o accu&s;e the four nuns, Vio|lante, Camilla, Alix, and Mariana, as be|ing her accomplices, and equally crimi|nal."</P>
<P>Here St. Ur&s;ula ended her narrative. It created horror and &s;urpri&s;e throughout; but when &s;he related the inhuman murder of Agnes, the indignation of the mob was &s;o audibly te&s;tified, that it was &s;carcely po&s;|&s;ible to hear the conclu&s;ion. This confu|&s;ion increa&s;ed with every moment. At length a multitude of voices exclaimed, that the priore&s;s &s;hould be given up to their fury. To this Don Ramirez po&s;itively refu&s;ed to con&s;ent. Even Lorenzo bade the people remember, that &s;he had undergone no trial, and advi&s;ed them to leave her pu|ni&s;hment to the Inqui&s;ition. All repre&s;en|tations were fruitle&s;s; the di&s;turbance grew
<PB N="145" REF="146">
&s;till more violent, and the populace more exa&s;perated. In vain did Ramirez attempt to convey his pri&s;oner out of the throng. Wherever he turned, a band of rioters barred his pa&s;&s;age, and demanded her being delivered over to them more loudly than before. Ramirez ordered his attendants to cut their way through the multitude. Oppre&s;&s;ed by numbers, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to draw their &s;words. He threat|ened the mob with the vengeance of the In|qui&s;ition: but, in this moment of popular phren&s;y, even this dreadful name had lo&s;t its effect. Though regret for his &s;i&s;ter made him look upon the priore&s;s with ab|horrence, Lorenzo could not help pitying a woman in a &s;ituation &s;o terrible: but in &s;pite of all his exertions and tho&s;e of the duke, of Don Ramirez and the archers, the people continued to pre&s;s onwards. They forced a pa&s;&s;age through the guards who protected their de&s;tined victim, drag|ged her from her &s;helter, and proceeded to take upon her a mo&s;t &s;ummary and cruel
<PB N="146" REF="147">
vengeance. Wild with terror, and &s;carcely knowing what &s;he &s;aid, the wretched wo|man &s;hrieked for a moment's mercy: &s;he prote&s;ted that &s;he was innocent of the death of Agnes, and could clear her&s;elf from the &s;u&s;picion beyond the power of doubt. The rioters heeded nothing but the gratifi|cation of their barbarous vengeance. They refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to her: they &s;hewed her every &s;ort of in&s;ult, loaded her with mud and filth, and called her by the mo&s;t op|probrious appellations. They tore her one from another, and each new tormentor was more &s;avage than the former. They &s;tifled with howls and execrations her &s;hrill cries for mercy, and dragged her through the &s;treets, &s;purning her, trampling her, and treating her with every &s;pecies of cruelty which hate or vindictive fury could invent. At length a flint, aimed by &s;ome well-directing hand, &s;truck her full upon the temple. She &s;ank upon the ground bathed in blood, and in a few minutes terminated her mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. Yet though &s;he
<PB N="147" REF="148">
no longer felt their in&s;ults, the rioters &s;till exerci&s;ed their impotent rage upon her life|le&s;s body. They beat it, trod upon it, and ill-u&s;ed it, till it became no more than a ma&s;s of fle&s;h, un&s;ightly, &s;hapele&s;s, and di&s;|gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Unable to prevent this &s;hocking event, Lorenzo and his friends had beheld it with the utmo&s;t horror: but they were rou&s;ed from their compelled inactivity, on hearing that the mob was attacking the convent of St. Clare. The incen&s;ed populace, con|founding the innocent with the guilty, had re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all the nuns of that or|der to their rage, and not to leave one &s;tone of the building upon another. Alarmed at this intelligence, they ha&s;tened to the convent, re&s;olved to defend it if po&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t to re&s;cue the inhabitants from the fury of the rioters. Mo&s;t of the nuns had fled, but a few &s;till remained in their habi|tation. Their &s;ituation was truly danger|ous. However, as they had taken the pre|caution of fa&s;tening the inner gates, with
<PB N="148" REF="149">
this a&s;&s;i&s;tance Lorenzo hoped to repel the mob, till Don Ramirez &s;hould return to him with a more &s;ufficient force.</P>
<P>Having been conducted by the former di&s;turbance to the di&s;tance of &s;ome &s;treets from the convent, he did not immediately reach it. When he arrived, the throng &s;urrounding it was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as to pre|vent his approaching the gates. In the in|terim, the populace be&s;ieged the building with per&s;evering rage: they battered the walls, threw lighted torches in at the win|dows, and &s;wore that by break of day not a nun of St. Clare's order &s;hould be left alive. Lorenzo had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded in piercing his way through the crowd, when one of the gates was forced open. The rioters pour|ed into the interior part of the building, where they exerci&s;ed their vengeance upon every thing which found it&s;elf in their pa&s;|&s;age. They broke the furniture into pieces, tore down the pictures, de&s;troyed the re|liques, and in their hatred of her &s;ervant forgot all re&s;pect to the &s;aint. Some em|ployed
<PB N="149" REF="150">
them&s;elves in &s;earching out the nuns, others in pulling down parts of the convent, and others again in &s;etting fire to the pictures and valuable furniture which it contained. The&s;e latter produced the mo&s;t deci&s;ive de&s;olation. Indeed the con|&s;equences of their action were more &s;udden than them&s;elves had expected or wi&s;hed. The flames ri&s;ing from the burning piles caught part of the building, which being old and dry, the conflagration &s;pread with rapidity from room to room. The walls were &s;oon &s;haken by the devouring ele|ment. The columns gave way, the roofs came tumbling down upon the rioters, and cru&s;hed many of them beneath their weight. Nothing was to be heard but &s;hrieks and groans. The convent was wrapped in flames, and the whole pre&s;ented a &s;cene of deva&s;tation and horror.</P>
<P>Lorenzo was &s;hocked at having been the cau&s;e, however innocent, of this fright|ful di&s;turbance: he endeavoured to repair his fault by protecting the helple&s;s inhabi|tants
<PB N="150" REF="151">
of the convent. He entered it with the mob, and exerted him&s;elf to repre&s;s the prevailing fury, till the &s;udden and alarm|ing progre&s;s of the flames compelled him to provide for his own &s;afety. The people now hurried out as eagerly as they had be|fore thronged in; but their numbers clog|ging up the door-way, and the fire gaining upon them rapidly, many of them peri&s;hed ere they had time to effect their e&s;cape. Lorenzo's good fortune directed him to a &s;mall door in a farther ai&s;le of the chapel. The bolt was already undrawn: he opened the door, and found him&s;elf at the foot of St. Clare's &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>Here he &s;topped to breathe. The duke and &s;ome of his attendants had followed him, and thus were in &s;ecurity for the pre|&s;ent. They now con&s;ulted what &s;teps they &s;hould take to e&s;cape from this &s;cene of di&s;|turbance; but their deliberations were con|&s;iderably interrupted by the &s;ight of volumes of fire ri&s;ing from amid&s;t the convent's ma&s;&s;y walls, by the noi&s;e of &s;ome heavy
<PB N="151" REF="152">
arch tumbling down in ruins, or by the mingled &s;hrieks of the nuns and rioters, either &s;uffocating in the pre&s;s, peri&s;hing in the flames, or cru&s;hed beneath the weight of the falling man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lorenzo enquired, whither the wicket led? He was an&s;wered, to the garden of the Capuchins; and it was re&s;olved to explore an outlet upon that &s;ide. Accordingly the duke rai&s;ed the latch, and pa&s;&s;ed into the adjoining cemetery. The attendants fol|lowed without ceremony. Lorenzo, being the la&s;t, was al&s;o on the point of quitting the colonnade, when he &s;aw the door of the &s;epulchre opened &s;oftly. Some one looked out, but on perceiving &s;trangers uttered a loud &s;hriek, &s;tarted back again, and flew down the marble &s;tairs.</P>
<P>"What can this mean?" cried Lorenzo: "Here is &s;ome my&s;tery concealed. Follow me without delay!"</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he ha&s;tened into the &s;epul|chre, and pur&s;ued the per&s;on who continued to fly before him. The duke knew not the
<PB N="152" REF="153">
cau&s;e of this exclamation, but, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had good rea&s;ons for it, followed him without he&s;itation. The others did the &s;ame, and the whole party &s;oon arrived at the foot of the &s;tairs. The upper door having been left open, the neighbouring flames darted from above a &s;ufficient light to enable Lorenzo's catching a glance of the fugitive running through the long pa&s;|&s;ages and di&s;tant vaults; but when a &s;udden turn deprived him of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, total darkne&s;s &s;ucceeded, and he could only trace the object of his enquiry by the faint echo of retiring feet. The pur&s;uers were now compelled to proceed with caution: as well as they could judge, the fugitive al&s;o &s;eemed to &s;lacken pace, for they heard the &s;teps follow each other at longer intervals. They at length were bewildered by the la|byrinth of pa&s;&s;ages, and di&s;per&s;ed in various directions. Carried away by his eagerne&s;s to clear up this my&s;tery, and to penetrate into which he was impelled by a move|ment &s;ecret and unaccountable, Lorenzo

heeded not this circum&s;tance till he found him&s;elf in total &s;olitude. The noi&s;e of foot|&s;teps had cea&s;ed, all was &s;ilent around, and no clue offered it&s;elf to guide him to the flying per&s;on. He &s;topped to reflect on the means mo&s;t likely to aid his pur&s;uit. He was per&s;uaded that no common cau&s;e would have induced the fugitive to &s;eek that drea|ry place at an hour &s;o unu&s;ual: the cry which he had heard, &s;eemed uttered in a voice of terror; and he was convinced that &s;ome my&s;tery was attached to this event. After &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed in he&s;itation, he continued to proceed, feeling his way along the walls of the pa&s;&s;age. He had already pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in this &s;low progre&s;s, when he de&s;cried a &s;park of light glimmer|ing at a di&s;tance. Guided by this ob&s;er|vation, and having drawn his &s;word, he bent his &s;teps towards the place whence the beam &s;eemed to be emitted.</P>
<P>It proceeded from the lamp which flamed before St. Clare's &s;tatue. Before it &s;tood &s;e|veral females; their white garments &s;tream|ing
<PB N="154" REF="155">
in the bla&s;t as it howled along the vaulted dungeons. Curious to know what had brought them together in this melan|choly &s;pot, Lorenzo drew near with pre|caution. The &s;trangers &s;eemed earne&s;tly engaged in conver&s;ation. They heard not Lorenzo's &s;teps, and he approached unob&s;erved, till he could hear their voices di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," continued &s;he who was &s;peaking when he arrived, and to whom the re&s;t were li&s;tening with great attention; "I prote&s;t, that I &s;aw them with my own eyes. I flew down the &s;teps, they pur&s;ued me, and I e&s;caped falling into their hands with difficulty. Had it not been for the lamp, I &s;hould never have found you."</P>
<P>"And what could bring them hither?" &s;aid another in a trembling voice;" do you think that they were looking for us?"</P>
<P>"God grant that my fears may be fal&s;e," rejoined the fir&s;t; "but I doubt they are murderers! If they di&s;cover us, we are lo&s;t! As for me, my fate is certain. My affinity

to the priore&s;s will be a &s;ufficient crime to condemn me; and though till now the&s;e vaults have afforded me a retreat . . . . . ."</P>
<P>Here looking up, her eye fell upon Lorenzo, who had continued to approach &s;lowly.</P>
<P>"The murderers!" &s;he cried.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted away from the &s;tatue's pede&s;|tal on which &s;he had been &s;eated, and at|tempted to e&s;cape by flight. Her com|panions at the &s;ame moment uttered a ter|rified &s;cream, while Lorenzo arre&s;ted the fugitive by the arm. Frightened and de|&s;perate, &s;he &s;ank upon her knees before him.</P>
<P>"Spare me!" &s;he exclaimed; "for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, &s;pare me! I am innocent, indeed, I am!"</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, her voice was almo&s;t choaked with fear. The beams of the lamp darting full upon her face, which was unveiled, Lorenzo recognized the beauti|ful Virginia de Villa-Franca. He ha&s;ten|ed to rai&s;e her from the ground, and be
<PB N="156" REF="157">
&s;ought her to take courage. He promi&s;ed to protect her from the rioters, a&s;&s;ured her that her retreat was &s;till a &s;ecret, and that &s;he might depend upon his readine&s;s to de|fend her to the la&s;t drop of his blood. During this conver&s;ation, the nuns had thrown them&s;elves into various attitudes: one knelt, and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven; another hid her face in the lap of her neighbour; &s;ome li&s;tened motionle&s;s with fear to the di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;uppo&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in; while others embraced the &s;tatue of St. Clare, and implored her protection with frantic cries. On perceiving their mi&s;take, they crowded round Lorenzo, and heaped benedictions on him by dozens. He found that on hearing the threats of the mob, and terrified by the cruelties which from the convent towers they had &s;een inflicted on the &s;uperior, many of the pen&s;ioners and nuns had taken refuge in the &s;epulchre. Among the former was to be reckoned the lovely Virginia, nearly related to the priore&s;s. She had more rea&s;on than the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
re&s;t to dread the rioters, and now be&s;ought Lorenzo earne&s;tly not to abandon her to their rage. Her companions, mo&s;t of whom were women of noble family, made the &s;ame reque&s;t, which he readily granted: he promi&s;ed not to quit them till he had &s;een each of them &s;afe in the arms of her relations. But he advi&s;ed their defer|ring to quit the &s;epulchre for &s;ome time longer, when the popular fury &s;hould be &s;omewhat calmed, and the arrival of mili|tary force have di&s;per&s;ed the multitude.</P>
<P>"Would to God," cried Virginia, "that I were already &s;afe in my mother's embraces! How &s;ay you, Segnor? will it be long ere we may leave this place? Every moment that I pa&s;s here, I pa&s;s in tor|ture!"</P>
<P>"I hope, not long," &s;aid he; "but till you can proceed with &s;ecurity, this &s;epul|chre will prove an impenetrable a&s;ylum. Here you run no ri&s;que of a di&s;covery, and I would advi&s;e your remaining quiet for the next two or three hours."</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">"Two or three hours?" exclaimed &s;i&s;|ter Helena: "If I &s;tay another hour in the&s;e vaults, I &s;hall expire with fear! Not the wealth of worlds &s;hould bribe me to undergo again what I have &s;uffered &s;ince my coming hither. Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! To be in this melancholy place in the middle of night, &s;urrounded by the mouldering bodies of my decea&s;ed companions, and expecting every moment to be torn in pieces by their gho&s;ts who wander about me, and complain, and groan, and wail in accents that make my blood run cold . . . . Chri&s;t Je&s;us! It is enough to drive me to madne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," replied Lorenzo, "if I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that while menaced by real woes you are capable of yielding to imagi|nary dangers. The&s;e terrors are puerile and groundle&s;s: combat them, holy &s;i&s;ter; I have promi&s;ed to guard you from the rioters, but again&s;t the attacks of &s;uper&s;ti|tion you mu&s;t depend for protection upon your&s;elf. The idea of gho&s;ts is ridiculous
<PB N="159" REF="160">
in the extreme; and if you continue to be &s;wayed by ideal terrors . . . . . ."</P>
<P>"Ideal?" exclaimed the nuns with one voice: "Why we heard it our&s;elves, Seg|nor! Every one of us heard it! It was fre|quently repeated, and it &s;ounded every time more melancholy and deep. You will never per&s;uade me that we could all have been deceived. Not we, indeed; no, no; had the noi&s;e been merely created by fancy . . . ."</P>
<P>"Hark! hark!" interrupted Virginia, in a voice of terror; "God pre&s;erve us! There it is again!"</P>
<P>The nuns cla&s;ped their hands together, and &s;ank upon their knees. Lorenzo look|ed round him eagerly, and was on the point of yielding to the fears which already had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the women. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed. He examined the vault, but nothing was to be &s;een. He now prepared to addre&s;s the nuns, and ridicule their child|i&s;h apprehen&s;ions, when his attention was arre&s;ted by a deep and long-drawn groan.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">"What was that?" he cried, and &s;tart|ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>"There, Segnor!" &s;aid Helena: "Now you mu&s;t be convinced! You have heard the noi&s;e your&s;elf! Now judge whether our terrors are imaginary. Since we have been here, that groaning has been repeated al|mo&s;t every five minutes. Doubtle&s;s it proceeds from &s;ome &s;oul in pain who wi&s;hes to be prayed out of purgatory: but none of us dare a&s;k it the que&s;tion. As for me, were I to &s;ee an apparition, the fright, I am very certain, would kill me out of hand."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, a &s;econd groan was heard yet more di&s;tinctly. The nuns cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and ha&s;tened to repeat their prayers again&s;t evil &s;pirits. Lorenzo li&s;|tened attentively. He even thought that he could di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ounds as of one &s;peak|ing in complaint, but di&s;tance rendered them inarticulate. The noi&s;e &s;eemed to come from the mid&s;t of the &s;mall vault in which he and the nuns then were, and
<PB N="161" REF="162">
which a multitude of pa&s;&s;ages branching out in various directions formed into a &s;ort of &s;tar. Lorenzo's curio&s;ity, which was ever awake, made him anxious to &s;olve this my&s;tery. He de&s;ired that &s;ilence might be kept. The nuns obeyed him. All was hu&s;hed till the general &s;tillne&s;s was again di&s;turbed by the groaning, which was re|peated &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. He per|ceived it to be mo&s;t audible, when upon following the &s;ound he was conducted clo&s;e to the &s;hrine of St. Clare.</P>
<P>"The noi&s;e comes from hence," &s;aid he: "Who&s;e is this &s;tatue?"</P>
<P>Helena, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed the que&s;|tion, pau&s;ed for a moment. Suddenly &s;he clapped her hands together.</P>
<P>"Aye!" cried &s;he, "it mu&s;t be &s;o. I have di&s;covered the meaning of the&s;e groans."</P>
<P>The nuns crowded round her, and be|&s;ought her eagerly to explain her&s;elf. She gravely replied, that for time immemorial the &s;tatue had been famous for performing
<PB N="162" REF="163">
miracles. From this &s;he inferred, that the &s;aint was concerned at the conflagration of a convent which &s;he protected, and expre&s;&s;|ed her grief by audible lamentations. Not having equal faith in the miraculous &s;aint, Lorenzo did not think this &s;olution of the my&s;tery-quite &s;o &s;atisfactory, as the nuns, who &s;ub&s;cribed to it without he&s;itation. In one point 'tis true that he agreed with Helena. He &s;u&s;pected that the groans proceeded from the &s;tatue: the more he li&s;|tened the more was he confirmed in this idea. He drew nearer to the image, de|&s;igning to in&s;pect it more clo&s;ely: but per|ceiving his intention, the nuns be&s;ought him for God's &s;ake to de&s;i&s;t, &s;ince, if he touched the &s;tatue, his death was inevi|table.</P>
<P>"And in what con&s;i&s;ts the danger?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Mother of God! In what?" replied Helena, ever eager to relate a miraculous adventure: "If you had only heard the hundredth part of tho&s;e marvellous &s;tories
<PB N="163" REF="164">
about this &s;tatue, which the domina u&s;ed to recount! She a&s;&s;ured us often and often, that if we only dared to lay a finger upon it, we might expect the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences. Among other things &s;he told us, that a robber having entered the&s;e vaults by night, he ob&s;erved yonder ruby, who&s;e value is ine&s;timable. Do you &s;ee it, Seg|nor? It &s;parkles upon the third finger of the hand in which &s;he holds a crown of thorns. This jewel naturally excited the villain's cupidity. He re&s;olved to make him&s;elf matter of it. For this purpo&s;e he a&s;cended the pede&s;tal; he &s;upported him|&s;elf by gra&s;ping the &s;aint's right arm, and extended his own towards the ring. What was his &s;urpri&s;e, when he &s;aw the &s;tatue's hand rai&s;ed in a po&s;ture of menace, and heard her lips pronounce his eternal perdi|tion! Penetrated with awe and con&s;terna|tion, he de&s;i&s;ted from his attempt, and pre|pared to quit the &s;epulchre. In this he al&s;o failed. Flight was denied him. He found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage the hand
<PB N="164" REF="165">
which re&s;ted upon the right arm of the &s;tatue. In vain did he &s;truggle: he re|mained fixed to the image, till the in&s;up|portable and fiery angui&s;h which darted it&s;elf through his veins, compelled his &s;hrieking for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;epulchre was now filled with &s;pectators. The villain confe&s;&s;ed his &s;acrilege, and was only re|lea&s;ed by the &s;eparation of his hand from his body. It has remained ever &s;ince fa&s;|tened to the image. The robber turned hermit, and led ever after an exemplary life. But yet the &s;aint's decree was per|formed; and tradition &s;ays, that he con|tinues to haunt this &s;epulchre, and implore St. Clare's pardon with groans and lamen|tations. Now I think of it, tho&s;e which we have ju&s;t heard, may very po&s;&s;ibly have been uttered by the gho&s;t of this &s;inner: but of this I will not be po&s;itive. All that I can &s;ay is, that &s;ince that time no one has ever dared to touch the &s;tatue. Then do not be fool-hardy, good Segnor! For the love of heaven, give up your de&s;ign, nor
<PB N="165" REF="166">
expo&s;e your&s;elf unnece&s;&s;arily to certain de|&s;truction."</P>
<P>Not being convinced that his de&s;truction would be &s;o certain as Helena &s;eemed to think it, Lorenzo per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olu|tion. The nuns be&s;ought him to de&s;i&s;t, in piteous terms, and even pointed out the robber's hand, which was in effect &s;till vi&s;i|ble upon the arm of the &s;tatue. This proof, as they imagined, mu&s;t convince him. It was very far from doing &s;o; and they were greatly &s;candalized when he declared his &s;u&s;picion that the dried and &s;hrivelled fin|gers had been placed there by order of the priore&s;s. In &s;pite of their prayers and threats he approached the &s;tatue. He &s;prang over the iron rails which defended it, and the &s;aint underwent a thorough examina|tion. The image at fir&s;t appeared to be of &s;tone, but proved on further in&s;pection to be formed of no more &s;olid materials than coloured wood. He &s;hook it, and attempted to move it: but it appeared to be of a piece with the ba&s;e which it &s;tood upon. He ex|amined
<PB N="166" REF="167">
it over and over: &s;till no clue guided him to the &s;olution of this my&s;tery, for which the nuns were become equally &s;olicitous, when they &s;aw that he touched the &s;tatue with impunity. He pau&s;ed, and li&s;tened: the groans were repeated at inter|vals, and he was convinced of being in the &s;pot neare&s;t to them. He mu&s;ed upon this &s;ingular event, and ran over the &s;tatue with enquiring eyes. Suddenly they re&s;ted upon the &s;hrivelled hand. It &s;truck him, that &s;o particular an injunction was not given without cau&s;e, not to touch the arm of the image. He again a&s;cended the pede&s;tal: he examined the object of his attention, and di&s;covered a &s;mall knob of iron con|cealed between the &s;aint's &s;houlder and what was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the hand of the robber. This ob&s;ervation delighted him. He applied his fingers to the knob, and pre&s;&s;ed it down forcibly. Immediately a rumbling noi&s;e was heard within the &s;tatue, as if a chain tightly &s;tretched was flying back. Startled at the &s;ound, the timid nuns
<PB N="167" REF="168">
&s;tarted away, prepared to ha&s;ten from the vault at the fir&s;t appearance of danger. All remaining quiet and &s;till, they again gathered round Lorenzo, and beheld his proceedings with anxious curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Finding that nothing followed this di&s;|covery, he de&s;cended. As he took his hand from the &s;aint, &s;he trembled beneath his touch. This created new terrors in the &s;pectators, who believed the &s;tatue to be animated. Lorenzo's ideas upon the &s;ub|ject were widely different. He ea&s;ily com|prehended, that the noi&s;e which he had heard was occa&s;ioned by his having loo&s;ened a chain which attached the image to its pede&s;tal. He once more attempted to move it, and &s;ucceeded without much exertion. He placed it upon the ground, and then perceived the pede&s;tal to be hollow, and covered at the opening with an heavy iron grate.</P>
<P>This excited &s;uch general curio&s;ity, that the &s;i&s;ters forgot both their real and imagi|nary dangers. Lorenzo proceeded to rai&s;e
<PB N="168" REF="169">
the grate, in which the nuns a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to the utmo&s;t of their &s;trength. The at|tempt was accompli&s;hed with little diffi|culty. A deep aby&s;s now pre&s;ented it&s;elf before them, who&s;e thick ob&s;curity the eye &s;trove in vain to pierce. The rays of the lamp were too feeble to be of much a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Nothing was di&s;cernible, &s;ave a flight of rough un&s;hapen &s;teps, which &s;ank into the yawning gulph, and were &s;oon lo&s;t in darkne&s;s. The groans were heard no more: but all believed them to have a&s;|cended from this cavern. As he bent over it, Lorenzo fancied that he di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;omething bright twinkling through the gloom. He gazed attentively upon the &s;pot where it &s;howed it&s;elf, and was con|vinced, that he &s;aw a &s;mall &s;park of light, now vi&s;ible, now di&s;appearing. He com|municated this circum&s;tance to the nuns: they al&s;o perceived the &s;park: but when he declared his intention to de&s;cend into the cave, they united to oppo&s;e his re&s;olu|tion. All their remon&s;trances could not
<PB N="169" REF="170">
prevail on him to alter it. None of them had courage enough to accompany him; neither could he think of depriving them of the lamp. Alone therefore, and in dark|ne&s;s, he prepared to pur&s;ue his de&s;ign, while the nuns were contented to offer up prayers for his &s;ucce&s;s and &s;afety.</P>
<P>The &s;teps were &s;o narrow and uneven, that to de&s;cend them was like walking down the &s;ide of a precipice. The ob&s;cu|rity by which he was &s;urrounded, rendered his footing in&s;ecure. He was obliged to proceed with great caution, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;s the &s;teps, and fall into the gulph be|low him. This he was &s;everal times on the point of doing. However, he arrived &s;ooner upon &s;olid ground than he had ex|pected. He now found, that the thick darkne&s;s and impenetrable mi&s;ts which reigned through the cavern, had deceived him into the belief of its being much more profound than it proved upon in&s;pection. He reached the foot of the &s;tairs unhurt: he now &s;topped, and looked round for the
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;park, which had before caught his atten|tion. He &s;ought it in vain: all was dark and gloomy. He li&s;tened for the groans; but his ear caught no &s;ound except the di&s;tant murmur of the nuns above, as in low voices they repeated their ave-marias. He &s;tood irre&s;olute to which &s;ide he &s;hould addre&s;s his &s;teps. At all events he deter|mined to proceed: he did &s;o, but &s;lowly, fearful le&s;t, in&s;tead of approaching, he &s;hould be retiring from the object of his &s;earch. The groans &s;eemed to announce one in pain, or at lea&s;t in &s;orrow, and he hoped to have the power of relieving the mourner's calamities. A plaintive tone, &s;ounding at no great di&s;tance, at length reached his hearing: he bent his cour&s;e joyfully towards it. It became more audi|ble as he advanced; and he &s;oon beheld again the &s;park of light, which a low pro|jecting wall had hitherto concealed from him.</P>
<P>It proceeded from a &s;mall lamp which was placed upon an heap of &s;tones, and
<PB N="171" REF="172">
who&s;e faint and melancholy rays &s;erved ra|ther to point out than di&s;pel the horrors of a narrow gloomy dungeon, formed in one &s;ide of the cavern: it al&s;o &s;hewed &s;everal other rece&s;&s;es of &s;imilar con&s;truction, but who&s;e depth was buried in ob&s;curity. Cold|ly played the light upon the damp walls, who&s;e dew-&s;tained &s;urface gave back a fee|ble reflection. A thick and pe&s;tilential fog clouded the height of the vaulted dungeon. As Lorenzo advanced, he felt a piercing chillne&s;s &s;pread it&s;elf through his veins. The frequent groans &s;till engaged him to move forwards. He turned towards them, and by the lamp's glimmering beams be|held, in a corner of this loath&s;ome abode, a creature &s;tretched upon a bed of &s;traw, &s;o wretched, &s;o emaciated, &s;o pale, that he doubted to think her woman. She was half naked: her long di&s;hevelled hair fell in di&s;|order order her face, and almo&s;t entirely concealed it. One wa&s;ted arm hung li&s;t|le&s;sly upon a tattered rug, which covered her convul&s;ed and &s;hivering limbs: the
<PB N="172" REF="173">
other was wrapped round a &s;mall bundle; and held it clo&s;ely to her bo&s;om. A large ro&s;ary lay near her: oppo&s;ite to her was a crucifix, on which &s;he bent her &s;unk eyes fixedly, and by her &s;ide &s;tood a ba&s;ket and a &s;mall earthen pitcher.</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;topped: he was petrified with horror. He gazed upon the mi&s;erable ob|ject with di&s;gu&s;t and pity. He trembled at the &s;pectacle: he grew &s;ick at heart: his &s;trength failed him, and his limbs were unable to &s;upport his weight. He was obliged to lean again&s;t the low wall which was near him, unable to go forward or to addre&s;s the &s;ufferer. She ca&s;t her eyes to|wards the &s;tair-ca&s;e: the wall concealed Lo|renzo, and &s;he ob&s;erved him not.</P>
<P>"No one comes!" &s;he at length mur|mured.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, her voice was hollow, and rattled in her throat: &s;he &s;ighed bitterly.</P>
<P>"No one comes!" &s;he repeated: "no! they have forgotten me! they will come no more!"</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">She pau&s;ed for a moment; then conti|nued mournfully:</P>
<P>"Two days! two long, long days, and yet no food! and yet no hope, no comfort! Fooli&s;h woman! how can I wi&s;h to lengthen a life &s;o wretched!&mdash;Yet &s;uch a death! O God! to peri&s;h by &s;uch a death! to linger out &s;uch ages in torture! Till now, I knew not what it was to hunger!&mdash;Hark!&mdash;No! no one comes: they will come no more."</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent. She &s;hivered, and drew the rug over her naked &s;houlders:</P>
<P>"I am very cold: I am &s;till unu&s;ed to the damps of this dungeon: 'tis &s;trange: but no matter. Colder &s;hall I &s;oon be, and yet not feel it. I &s;hall be cold, cold as thou art."</P>
<P>She looked at the bundle, which lay upon her brea&s;t. She bent over it, and ki&s;&s;ed it: then drew back ha&s;tily, and &s;huddered with di&s;gu&s;t:</P>
<P>"It was once &s;o &s;weet! It would have been &s;o lovely, &s;o like him! I have lo&s;t it for ever. How a few days have changed it! I &s;hould not know it again my&s;elf.
<PB N="174" REF="175">
Yet it is dear to me. God! how dear!&mdash;I will forget what it is! I will only remember what it was, and love it as well, as when it was &s;o &s;weet! &s;o lovely! &s;o like him! &mdash; I thought that I had wept away all my tears, but here is one &s;till lingering."</P>
<P>She wiped her eyes with a tre&s;s of her hair. She put out her hand for the pitcher, and reached it with difficulty. She ca&s;t into it a look of hopele&s;s enquiry. She &s;ighed, and replaced it upon the ground.</P>
<P>"Quite a void!&mdash;Not a drop!&mdash;Not one drop left to cool my &s;corched-up burn|ing palate!&mdash;Now would I give trea&s;ures for a draught of water!&mdash;And they are God's &s;ervants who make me &s;uffer thus!&mdash; They think them&s;elves holy, while they torture me like fiends!&mdash;They are cruel and unfeeling; and 'tis they who bid me repent; and 'tis they who threaten me with eternal perdition! Saviour, Saviour! you think not &s;o!"</P>
<P>She again fixed her eyes upon the cru|cifix, took her ro&s;ary, and, while &s;he told
<PB N="175" REF="176">
her beads, the quick motion of her lips de|clared her to be praying with fervency.</P>
<P>While he li&s;tened to her melancholy ac|cents, Lorenzo's &s;en&s;ibility became yet more violently affected. The fir&s;t &s;ight of &s;uch mi&s;ery had given a &s;en&s;ible &s;hock to his feelings: but that being pa&s;t, he now advanced towards the captive. She heard his &s;teps, and, uttering a cry of joy, dropped the ro&s;ary.</P>
<P>"Hark! hark! hark!" &s;he cried, "&s;ome one comes!"</P>
<P>She &s;trove to rai&s;e her&s;elf, but her &s;trength was unequal to the attempt; &s;he fell back, and, as &s;he &s;ank again upon the bed of &s;traw, Lorenzo heard the rattling of heavy chains. He &s;till approached, while the pri&s;oner thus continued:</P>
<P>"Is it you, Camilla? You are come then, at la&s;t? Oh! it was time! I thought that you had for&s;aken me; that I was doomed to peri&s;h of hunger. Give me to drink, Camilla, for pity's &s;ake; I am faint with
<PB N="176" REF="177">
long fa&s;ting, and grown &s;o weak that I can|not rai&s;e my&s;elf from the ground. Good Camilla, give me to drink, le&s;t I expire be|fore you."</P>
<P>Fearing that &s;urpri&s;e in her enfeebled &s;tate might be fatal, Lorenzo was at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s her.</P>
<P>"It is not Camilla," &s;aid he at length, &s;peaking in a &s;low and gentle voice.</P>
<P>"Who is it then?" replied the &s;ufferer; "Alix, perhaps, or Violante. My eyes are grown &s;o dim and feeble, that I cannot di&s;tingui&s;h your features; but whichever it is, if your brea&s;t is &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, if you are not more cruel than wolves and tigers, take pity on my &s;uffer|ings. You know that I am dying for want of &s;u&s;tenance. This is the third day &s;ince the&s;e lips have received nouri&s;hment. Do you bring me food? Or come you only to announce my death, and learn how long I have yet to exi&s;t in agony?"</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take my bu&s;ine&s;s," replied Lo|renzo;
<PB N="177" REF="178">
"I am no emi&s;&s;ary of the cruel pri|ore&s;s. I pity your &s;orrows, and come hi|ther to relieve them."</P>
<P>"To relieve them?" repeated the cap|tive; "&s;aid you, to relieve them?"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time &s;tarting from the ground, and &s;upporting her&s;elf upon her hands, &s;he gazed upon the &s;tranger ear|ne&s;tly.</P>
<P>"Great God!&mdash;Is it no illu&s;ion?&mdash;A man? Speak! Who are you? What brings you hither? Come you to &s;ave me, to re|&s;tore me to liberty, to life and light? Oh! &s;peak, &s;peak quickly, le&s;t I encourage an hope who&s;e di&s;appointment will de&s;troy me."</P>
<P>"Be calm!" replied Lorenzo, in a voice &s;oothing and compa&s;&s;ionate; "the domina of who&s;e cruelty you complain, has already paid the forfeit of her offences: you have nothing more to fear from her. A few mi|nutes will re&s;tore you to liberty and the embraces of your friends, from whom you have been &s;ecluded. You may rely upon my
<PB N="178" REF="179">
protection. Give me your hand, and be not fearful. Let me conduct you where you may receive tho&s;e attentions which your feeble &s;tate requires."</P>
<P>"Oh! yes! yes! yes!" cried the pri&s;oner with an exulting &s;hriek; "there is a God then, and a ju&s;t one! Joy! Joy! I &s;hall once more breathe the fre&s;h air, and view the light of the glorious &s;unbeams! I will go with you! Stranger, I will go with you! Oh! Heaven will ble&s;s you for pity|ing an unfortunate! But this too mu&s;t go with me," &s;he added, pointing to the &s;mall bundle, which &s;he &s;till cla&s;ped to her bo|&s;om; "I cannot part with this. I will bear it away: it &s;hall convince the world how dreadful are the abodes &s;o fal&s;ely term|ed religious. Good &s;tranger! lend me your hand to ri&s;e; I am faint with want, and &s;orrow, and &s;ickne&s;s, and my &s;trength has quite for&s;aken me! So, that is well!"</P>
<P>As Lorenzo &s;tooped to rai&s;e her, the beams of the lamp &s;truck full upon his face.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">"Almighty God!" &s;he exclaimed: "Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;That look! tho&s;e features!&mdash; Oh! yes, it is, it is . . . . ."</P>
<P>She extended her arms to throw them round him, but her enfeebled frame was un|able to &s;u&s;tain the emotions which agitated her bo&s;om. She fainted, and again &s;ank upon the bed of &s;traw.</P>
<P>Lorenzo was &s;urpri&s;ed at her la&s;t excla|mation. He thought that he had before heard &s;uch accents as her hollow voice had ju&s;t formed, but where, he could not re|member. He &s;aw, that in her dangerous &s;ituation immediate phy&s;ical aid was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, and he ha&s;tened to convey her from the dungeon. He was at fir&s;t prevented from doing &s;o by a &s;trong chain fa&s;tened round the pri&s;oner's body, and fix|ing her to the neighbouring wall. How|ever, his natural &s;trength being aided by anxiety to relieve the unfortunate, he &s;oon forced out the &s;taple, to which one end of the chain was attached: then taking the captive in his arms, he bent his cour&s;e to|wards
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the &s;tair-ca&s;e. The rays of the lamp above, as well as the murmur of female voices, guided his &s;teps. He gained the &s;tairs, and in a few minutes after arrived at the iron-grate.</P>
<P>The nuns during his ab&s;ence had been terribly tormented by curio&s;ity and appre|hen&s;ion. They were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and delighted on &s;eeing him &s;uddenly emerge from the cave. Every heart was filled with compa&s;&s;ion for the mi&s;erable creature, whom he bore in his arms. While the nuns, and Virginia in particular, employed them&s;elves in &s;triving to recall her to her &s;en&s;es, Lo|renzo related in few words the manner of his finding her. He then ob&s;erved to them, that by this time the tumult mu&s;t have been quelled, and that he could now con|duct them to their friends without danger. All were eager to quit the &s;epulchre. Still, to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of ill-u&s;age, they be&s;ought Lorenzo to venture out fir&s;t alone, and examine whether the coa&s;t was clear. With this reque&s;t he complied.
<PB N="181" REF="182">
Helena offered to conduct him to the &s;tair|ca&s;e, and they were on the point of depart|ing, when a &s;trong light fla&s;hed from &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages upon the adjacent walls. At the &s;ame time &s;teps were heard of people approaching ha&s;tily, and who&s;e number &s;eemed to be con&s;iderable. The nuns were greatly alarmed at this circum&s;tance; they &s;uppo&s;ed their retreat to be di&s;covered, and the rioters to be advancing in pur&s;uit of them. Ha&s;tily quitting the pri&s;oner, who remained in&s;en&s;ible, they crowded round Lorenzo, and claimed his promi&s;e to protect them. Virginia alone forgot her own danger by &s;triving to relieve the &s;orrows of another. She &s;upported the &s;ufferer's head upon her knees, bathing her temples with ro&s;e-water, chafing her cold hands, and &s;prinkling her face with tears which were drawn from her by compa&s;&s;ion. The &s;trangers approaching nearer, Lorenzo was enabled to di&s;pel the fears of the &s;up|pliants. His name pronounced by a num|ber of voices, among which he di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the duke's, pealed along the vaults,
<PB N="182" REF="183">
and convinced him that he was the object of their &s;earch. He communicated this intelligence to the nuns, who received it with rapture. A few moments after con|firmed his idea. Don Ramirez as well as the duke appeared, followed by atten|dants with torches. They had been &s;eek|ing him through the vaults, in order to let him know that the mob was di&s;per&s;ed, and the riot entirely over. Lorenzo recounted briefly his adventure in the cavern, and explained how much the unknown was in want of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He be&s;ought the duke to take charge of her, as well as of the nuns and pen&s;ioners.</P>
<P>"As for me," &s;aid he, "other cares de|mand my attention. While you with one half of the archers convey the&s;e ladies to their re&s;pective homes, I wi&s;h the other half to be left with me. I will examine the cavern below, and pervade the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the &s;epulchre. I cannot re&s;t till convinced that yonder wretched victim was the only one confined by &s;uper|&s;tition in the&s;e vaults."</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">The duke applauded his intention. Don Ramirez offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his enqui|ry, and his propo&s;al was accepted with gra|titude. The nuns, having made their ac|knowledgments to Lorenzo, committed them&s;elves to the care of his uncle, and were conducted from the &s;epulchre. Vir|ginia reque&s;ted that the unknown might be given to her in charge, and promi&s;ed to let Lorenzo know, whenever &s;he was &s;uffi|ciently recovered to accept his vi&s;its. In truth, &s;he made this promi&s;e more from con&s;ideration for her&s;elf, than for either Lorenzo or the captive. She had witne&s;&s;|ed his politene&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and intrepi|dity with &s;en&s;ible emotion. She wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to pre&s;erve his acquaintance; and in addition to the &s;entiments of pity which the pri&s;oner excited, &s;he hoped that her at|tention to this unfortunate would rai&s;e her a degree in the e&s;teem of Lorenzo. She had no occa&s;ion to trouble her&s;elf upon this head. The kindne&s;s already di&s;played by her, and the tender concern which &s;he had &s;hewn for the &s;ufferer, had gained her an
<PB N="184" REF="185">
exalted place in his good graces. While occupied in alleviating the captive's &s;or|rows, the nature of her employment adorn|ed her with new charms, and rendered her beauty a thou&s;and times more intere&s;ting. Lorenzo viewed her with admiration and delight: he con&s;idered her as a mini&s;tering angel de&s;cended to the aid of afflicted in|nocence; nor could his heart have re&s;i&s;ted her attractions, had it not been &s;teeled by the remembrance of Antonia.</P>
<P>The duke now conveyed the nuns in &s;afety to the dwellings of their re&s;pective friends. The re&s;cued pri&s;oner was &s;till in|&s;en&s;ible, and gave no &s;igns of life, except by occa&s;ional groans. She was borne upon a &s;ort of litter. Virginia, who was con&s;tantly by the &s;ide of it, was apprehen&s;ive that, ex|hau&s;ted by long ab&s;tinence, and &s;haken by the &s;udden change from bonds and darkne&s;s to liberty and light, her frame would never get the better of the &s;hock. Lorenzo and Don Ramirez &s;till remained in the &s;epulchre. After deliberating upon their proceedings, it was re&s;olved that, to prevent lo&s;ing time,
<PB N="185" REF="186">
the archers &s;hould be divided into two bodies: that with Don Ramirez &s;hould ex|amine the cavern, while Lorenzo, with the other, might penetrate into the further vaults. This being arranged, and his fol|lowers being provided with torches, Don Ramirez advanced to the cavern. He had already de&s;cended &s;ome &s;teps, when he heard people approaching ha&s;tily from the interior part of the &s;epulchre. This &s;urpri&s;ed him, and he quitted the cave precipitately.</P>
<P>"Do you hear foot-&s;teps?" &s;aid Loren|zo. "Let us bend our cour&s;e towards them. 'Tis from this &s;ide that they &s;eem to pro|ceed."</P>
<P>At that moment a loud and piercing &s;hriek induced him to quicken his &s;teps.</P>
<P>"Help! help, for God's &s;ake!" cried a voice, who&s;e melodious tone penetrated Lorenzo's heart with terror.</P>
<P>He flew towards the cry with the rapi|dity of lightning, and was followed by Don Ramirez with equal &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>

<P>ALL this while Ambro&s;io was uncon|&s;cious of the dreadful &s;cenes which were pa&s;&s;ing &s;o near. The execution of his de|&s;igns upon Antonia employed his every thought. Hitherto he was &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of his plans. Antonia had drunk
<PB N="187" REF="188">
the opiate, was buried in the vaults of St. Clare, and ab&s;olutely in his di&s;po&s;al. Ma|tilda, who was well acquainted with the na|ture and effects of the &s;oporific medicine, had computed that it would not cea&s;e to operate till one in the morning. For that hour he waited with impatience. The fe&s;tival of St. Clare pre&s;ented him with a favourable opportunity of con&s;ummating his crime. He was certain that the friars and nuns would be engaged in the proce&s;|&s;ion, and that he had no cau&s;e to dread an interruption: from appearing him&s;elf at the head of his monks, he had de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. He doubted not, that being be|yond the reach of help, cut off from all the world, and totally in his power, Antonia would comply with his de&s;ires. The affec|tion which &s;he had ever expre&s;&s;ed for him, warranted this per&s;ua&s;ion: but he re&s;olved, that &s;hould &s;he prove ob&s;tinate, no con|&s;ideration whatever &s;hould prevent him from enjoying her. Secure from a di&s;co|very, he &s;huddered not at the idea of em|ploying
<PB N="188" REF="189">
force; or, if he felt any repug|nance, it aro&s;e not from a principle of &s;hame or compa&s;&s;ion, but from his feeling for Antonia the mo&s;t &s;incere and ardent af|fection, and wi&s;hing to owe her favours to no one but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The monks quitted the abbey at mid|night. Matilda was among the chori&s;ters, and led the chaunt. Ambro&s;io was left by him&s;elf, and at liberty to pur&s;ue his own inclinations. Convinced that no one re|mained behind to watch his motions, or di&s;turb his plea&s;ures, he now ha&s;tened to the we&s;tern ai&s;les. His heart beating with hope not unmingled with anxiety, he cro&s;&s;ed the garden, unlocked the door which ad|mitted him into the cemetery, and in a few minutes he &s;tood before the vaults. Here he pau&s;ed: he looked round him with &s;u&s;|picion, con&s;cious that his bu&s;ine&s;s was unfit for any other eye. As he &s;tood in he&s;ita|tion, he heard the melancholy &s;hriek of the &s;creech-owl: the wind rattled loudly again&s;t the windows of the adjacent convent, and,
<PB N="189" REF="190">
as the current &s;wept by him, bore with it the faint notes of the chaunt of chori&s;ters. He opened the door cautiou&s;ly, as if fearing to be overheard; he entered, and clo&s;ed it again after him. Guided by his lamp, he thread|ed the long pa&s;&s;ages, in who&s;e windings Matilda had in&s;tructed him, and reached the private vault which contained his &s;leep|ing mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Its entrance was by no means ea&s;y to di&s;|cover; but this was no ob&s;tacle to Ambro|&s;io, who at the time of Antonia's funeral had ob&s;erved it too carefully to be deceived. He found the door, which was unfa&s;tened, pu&s;hed it open, and de&s;cended into the dungeon. He approached the humble tomb in which Antonia repo&s;ed. He had provided him&s;elf with an iron crow and a pick-axe: but this precaution was unne|ce&s;&s;ary. The grate was &s;lightly fa&s;tened on the out&s;ide: he rai&s;ed it, and, placing the lamp upon its ridge, bent &s;ilently over the tomb. By the &s;ide of three putrid half-corrupted bodies lay the &s;leeping beauty.
<PB N="190" REF="191">
A lively red, the forerunner of returning animation, had already &s;pread it&s;elf over her cheeks; and as wrapped in her &s;hroud &s;he reclined upon her funeral bier, &s;he &s;eemed to &s;mile at the images of death around her. While he gazed upon their rotting bones and di&s;gu&s;ting figures, who perhaps were once as &s;weet and lovely, Ambro&s;io thought upon Elvira, by him reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate. As the memory of that horrid act glanced upon his mind, it was clouded with a gloomy horror; yet it &s;erved but to &s;trengthen his re&s;olution to de&s;troy Antonia's honour.</P>
<P>"For your &s;ake, fatal beauty!" mur|mured the monk, while gazing on his de|voted prey, "for your &s;ake have I com|mitted this murder, and &s;old my&s;elf to eter|nal tortures. Now you are in my power: the produce of my guilt will at lea&s;t be mine. Hope not that your prayers breath|ed in tones of unequalled melody, your bright eyes filled with tears, and your hands lifted in &s;upplication, as when &s;eeking in
<PB N="191" REF="192">
penitence the Virgin's pardon: hope not, that your moving innocence, your beau|teous grief, or all your &s;uppliant arts, &s;hall ran&s;om you from my embraces. Before the break of day, mine you mu&s;t, and mine you &s;hall be!"</P>
<P>He lifted her, &s;till motionle&s;s, from the tomb: he &s;eated him&s;elf upon a bank of &s;tone, and, &s;upporting her in his arms, watched impatiently for the &s;ymptoms of returning animation. Scarcely could he command his pa&s;&s;ions &s;ufficiently, to re&s;train him&s;elf from enjoying her while yet in&s;en|&s;ible. His natural lu&s;t was increa&s;ed in ar|dour by the difficulties which had oppo&s;ed his &s;atisfying it; as al&s;o by his long ab&s;ti|nence from woman, &s;ince, from the moment of re&s;igning her claim to his love, Matilda had exiled him from her arms for ever.</P>
<P>"I am no pro&s;titute, Ambro&s;io," had &s;he told him, when, in the fullne&s;s of his lu&s;t, he demanded her favours with more than u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s; "I am now no more than your friend, and will not be your mi&s;|tre&s;s.
<PB N="192" REF="193">
Cea&s;e then to &s;olicit my complying with de&s;ires which in&s;ult me. While your heart was mine, I gloried in your embraces. Tho&s;e happy times are pa&s;t; my per&s;on is become indifferent to you, and 'tis nece&s;&s;ity, not love, which makes you &s;eek my enjoy|ment. I cannot yield to a reque&s;t &s;o hu|miliating to my pride."</P>
<P>Suddenly deprived of plea&s;ures, the u&s;e of which had made them an ab&s;olute want, the monk felt this re&s;traint &s;everely. Na|turally addicted to the gratification of the &s;en&s;es, in the full vigour of manhood and heat of blood, he had &s;uffered his tempera|ment to acquire &s;uch a&s;cendency, that his lu&s;t was become madne&s;s. Of his fondne&s;s for Antonia, none but the gro&s;&s;er particles remained; he longed for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on; and even the gloom of the vault, the &s;urrounding &s;ilence, and the re&s;i&s;tance which he expected from her, &s;eemed to give a fre&s;h edge to his fierce and unbridled de|&s;ires.</P>
<P>Gradually he felt the bo&s;om which re&s;ted
<PB N="193" REF="194">
again&s;t his glow with returning warmth. Her heart throbbed again, her blood flow|ed &s;wifter, and her lips moved. At length &s;he opened her eyes; but, &s;till oppre&s;&s;ed and bewildered by the effects of the &s;trong opiate, &s;he clo&s;ed them again immediately. Ambro&s;io watched her narrowly, nor per|mitted a movement to e&s;cape him. Perceiv|ing that &s;he was fully re&s;tored to exi&s;tence, he caught her in rapture to his bo&s;om, and clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed his lips to hers. The &s;ud|denne&s;s of his action &s;ufficed to di&s;&s;ipate the fumes which ob&s;cured Antonia's rea&s;on. She ha&s;tily rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and ca&s;t a wild look round her. The &s;trange images which pre&s;ented them&s;elves on every &s;ide contri|buted to confu&s;e her. She put her hand to her head, as if to &s;ettle her di&s;ordered ima|gination. At length &s;he took it away, and threw her eyes through the dungeon a &s;e|cond time. They fixed on the abbot's face.</P>
<P>"Where am I?" &s;he &s;aid abruptly. "How came I here?&mdash;Where is my mo|ther?
<PB N="194" REF="195">
Methought I &s;aw her! Oh! a dream, a dreadful dreadful dream told me . . . . . . But where am I? Let me go! I cannot &s;tay here!"</P>
<P>She attempted to ri&s;e, but the monk pre|vented her.</P>
<P>"Be calm, lovely Antonia!" he replied; "no danger is near you: confide in my pro|tection. Why do you gaze on me &s;o ear|ne&s;tly? Do you not know me? Not know your friend, Ambro&s;io?"</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io? my friend?&mdash;Oh! yes, yes; I remember . . . . . . But why am I here? Who has brought me? Why are you with me?&mdash;Oh! Flora bade me beware . . . . .! &mdash;Here are nothing but graves, and tombs, and &s;keletons! This place frightens me! Good Ambro&s;io, take me away from it, for it recalls my fearful dream!&mdash;Methought I was dead, and laid in my grave!&mdash;Good Ambro&s;io, take me from hence!&mdash;Will you not? Oh! will you not?&mdash;Do not look on me thus!&mdash;Your flaming eyes terrify
<PB N="195" REF="196">
me!&mdash;Spare me, father! Oh! &s;pare me for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>"Why the&s;e terrors, Antonia?" rejoined the abbot, folding her in his arms, and co|vering her bo&s;om with ki&s;&s;es which &s;he in vain &s;truggled to avoid. "What fear you from me, from one who adores you? What matters it where you are? This &s;epulchre &s;eems to me Love's bower. This gloom is the friendly night of My&s;tery, which he &s;preads over our delights! Such do I think it, and &s;uch mu&s;t my Antonia. Yes, my &s;weet girl! yes! Your veins &s;hall glow with the fire which circles in mine, and my tran&s;|ports &s;hall be doubled by your &s;haring them!"</P>
<P>While he &s;poke thus, he repeated his embraces, and permitted him&s;elf the mo&s;t indecent liberties. Even Antonia's igno|rance was not proof again&s;t the freedom of his behaviour. She was &s;en&s;ible of her dan|ger, forced her&s;elf from his arms, and her &s;hroud being her only garment, &s;he wrap|ped it clo&s;ely round her.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197">"Unhand me, father!" &s;he cried, her hone&s;t indignation tempered by alarm at her unprotected po&s;ition: "Why have you brought me to this place? Its appearance freezes me with horror! Convey me from hence, if you have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of pity and humanity! Let me return to the hou&s;e, which I have quitted I know not how; but &s;tay here one moment longer, I neither will nor ought."</P>
<P>Though the monk was &s;omewhat &s;tartled by the re&s;olute tone in which this &s;peech was delivered, it produced upon him no other effect than &s;urpri&s;e. He caught her hand, forced her upon his knee, and, gaz|ing upon her with gloting eyes, he thus replied to her:</P>
<P>"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, Antonia. Re&s;i&s;tance is unavailing, and I need di&s;avow my pa&s;&s;ion for you no longer. You are imagined dead; &s;ociety is for ever lo&s;t to you. I po&s;|&s;e&s;s you here alone; you are ab&s;olutely in my power, and I burn with de&s;ires which I mu&s;t either gratify or die: but I would
<PB N="197" REF="198">
owe my happine&s;s to your&s;elf. My lovely girl! my adorable Antonia! let me in&s;truct you in joys to which you are &s;till a &s;tranger, and teach you to feel tho&s;e plea&s;ures in my arms, which I mu&s;t &s;oon enjoy in yours. Nay, this &s;truggling is childi&s;h," he con|tinued, &s;eeing her repel his care&s;&s;es, and endeavour to e&s;cape from his gra&s;p; "no aid is near; neither heaven nor earth &s;hall &s;ave you from my embraces. Yet why reject plea&s;ures &s;o &s;weet, &s;o rapturous? No one ob&s;erves us; our loves will be a &s;ecret to all the world. Love and opportunity in|vite your giving loo&s;e to your pa&s;&s;ions. Yield to them, my Antonia! yield to them, my lovely girl! Throw your arms thus fondly round me; join your lips thus clo&s;ely to mine! Amid&s;t all her gifts, has Nature denied her mo&s;t precious, the &s;en&s;ibility of plea&s;ure? Oh! impo&s;&s;ible! Every feature, look, and motion declares you formed to ble&s;s, and to be ble&s;&s;ed your&s;elf! Turn not on me tho&s;e &s;upplicating eyes: con&s;ult your own charms; they will tell you that I

am proof again&s;t entreaty. Can I relin|qui&s;h the&s;e limbs &s;o white, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o deli|cate! the&s;e &s;welling brea&s;ts, round, full, and ela&s;tic! the&s;e lips fraught with &s;uch inexhau&s;tible &s;weetne&s;s? Can I relinqui&s;h the&s;e trea&s;ures, and leave them to another's enjoyment? No, Antonia; never, never! I &s;wear it by this ki&s;s! and this! and this!"</P>
<P>With every moment the friar's pa&s;&s;ion became more ardent, and Antonia's terror more inten&s;e. She &s;truggled to di&s;engage her&s;elf from his arms. Her exertions were un&s;ucce&s;sful; and, finding that Ambro&s;io's conduct became &s;till freer, &s;he &s;hrieked for a&s;&s;i&s;tance with all her &s;trength. The a&s;pect of the vault, the pale glimmering of the lamp, the &s;urrounding ob&s;curity, the &s;ight of the tomb, and the objects of mortality which met her eyes on either &s;ide, were ill calculated to in&s;pire her with tho&s;e emo|tions by which the friar was agitated. Even his care&s;&s;es terrified her from their fury, and created no other &s;entiment than
<PB N="199" REF="200">
fear. On the contrary, her alarm, her evi|dent di&s;gu&s;t, and ince&s;&s;ant oppo&s;ition, &s;eem|ed only to inflame the monk's de&s;ires, and &s;upply his brutality with additional &s;trength. Antonia's &s;hrieks were unheard; yet &s;he continued them, nor abandoned her endea|vours to e&s;cape, till exhau&s;ted and out of breath &s;he &s;ank from his arms upon her knees, and once more had recour&s;e to prayers and &s;upplications. This attempt had no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former. On the contrary, taking advantage of her &s;itu|ation, the ravi&s;her threw him&s;elf by her &s;ide. He cla&s;ped her to his bo&s;om almo&s;t lifele&s;s with terror, and faint with &s;truggling. He &s;tifled her cries with ki&s;&s;es, treated her with the rudene&s;s of an unprincipled barbarian, proceeded from freedom to freedom, and, in the violence of his lu&s;tful delirium, wounded and brui&s;ed her tender limbs. Heedle&s;s of her tears, cries and entreaties, he gradually made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of her per&s;on, and de&s;i&s;ted not from his prey, till
<PB N="200" REF="201">
he had accompli&s;hed his crime and the di&s;|honour of Antonia.</P>
<P>Scarcely had he &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign, than he &s;huddered at him&s;elf, and the means by which it was effected. The very exce&s;s of his former eagerne&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s Antonia now contributed to in&s;pire him with di&s;|gu&s;t; and a &s;ecret impul&s;e made him feel how ba&s;e and unmanly was the crime which he had ju&s;t committed. He &s;tarted ha&s;tily from her arms. Star, who &s;o lately had been the object of his adoration, now rai&s;ed no other &s;entiment in his heart than aver|&s;ion and rage. He turned away from her; or, if his eyes re&s;ted upon her figure invo|luntarily, it was only to dart upon her looks of bate. The unfortunate had fainted ere the completion of her di&s;grace: &s;he only recovered life to be &s;en&s;ible of her misfor|tune. She remained &s;tretched upon the earth in &s;ilent de&s;pair; the tears cha&s;ed each other &s;lowly down her cheeks, and her bo&s;om heaved with frequent &s;obs. Oppre&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="201" REF="202">
grief, &s;he continued for &s;ome time in this &s;tate of torpidity. At length &s;he ro&s;e with difficulty, and, dragging her feeble &s;teps towards the door, prepared to quit the dungeon.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of her foot-&s;teps rou&s;ed the monk from his &s;ullen apathy. Starting from the tomb again&s;t which he reclined, while his eyes wandered over the images of corruption contained in it, he pur&s;ued the victim of his brutality, and &s;oon over|took her. He &s;eized her by the arm, and violently forced her back into the dun|geon.</P>
<P>"Whither go you?" he cried in a &s;tern voice; "return this in&s;tant!"</P>
<P>Antonia trembled at the fury of his coun|tenance.</P>
<P>"What would you more?" &s;he &s;aid with timidity: "Is not my ruin completed? Am I not undone, undone for ever? Is not your cruelty contented, or have I yet more to &s;uffer? Let me depart: let me return to
<PB N="202" REF="203">
my home, and weep unre&s;trained my &s;hame and my affliction!"</P>
<P>"Return to your home?" repeated the monk, with bitter and contemptuous mock|ery; then &s;uddenly his eyes flaming with pa&s;&s;ion, "What? That you may denounce me to the world? that you may proclaim me a hypocrite, a ravi&s;her, a betrayer, a mon&s;ter of cruelty, lu&s;t, and ingratitude? No, no, no! I know well the whole weight of my offences; well, that your complaints would be too ju&s;t, and my crimes too no|torious! You &s;hall not from hence to tell Madrid that I am a villain; that my con|&s;cience is loaded with &s;ins, which make me de&s;pair of Heaven's pardon. Wretched girl, you mu&s;t &s;tay here with me! Here amid&s;t the&s;e lonely tombs, the&s;e images of death, the&s;e rotting, loath&s;ome, corrupted bodies! here &s;hall you &s;tay, and witne&s;s my &s;ufferings; witne&s;s what it is to be in the horrors of de&s;pondency, and breathe the la&s;t groan in bla&s;phemy and cur&s;es!&mdash;
<PB N="203" REF="204">
And whom am I to thank for this? What &s;educed me into crimes, who&s;e bare re|membrance makes me &s;hudder? Fatal witch! was it not thy beauty? Have you not plunged my &s;oul into infamy? Have you not made me a perjured hypocrite, a ravi&s;her, an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? Nay, at this moment, does not that angel look bid me de&s;pair of God's forgivene&s;s? Oh! when I &s;tand be|fore his judgment-throne, that look will &s;uffice to damn me! You will tell my judge, that you were happy, till <HI>I</HI> &s;aw you; that you were innocent, till <HI>I</HI> polluted you! You will come with tho&s;e tearful eyes, tho&s;e cheeks pale and gha&s;tly, tho&s;e hands li&s;ted in &s;upplication, as when you &s;ought from me that mercy which I gave not! Then will my perdition be certain! Then will come your mother's gho&s;t, and hurl me down into the dwellings of fiends, and flames, and furies, and everla&s;ting torments! And 'tis you who will accu&s;e me! 'tis you who will cau&s;e my eternal angui&s;h!&mdash;you, wretched girl! you! you!"</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">As he thundered out the&s;e words, he vi|olently gra&s;ped Antonia's arm, and &s;purned the earth with delirious fury.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing his brain to be turned, Anto|nia &s;ank in terror upon her knees; &s;he lift|ed up her hands, and her voice almo&s;t died away ere &s;he could give it utterance.</P>
<P>"Spare me! &s;pare me!" &s;he murmured with difficulty.</P>
<P>"Silence!" cried the friar madly, and da&s;hed her upon the ground&mdash;</P>
<P>He quitted her, and paced the dungeon with a wild and di&s;ordered air. His eyes rolled fearfully; Antonia trembled whenever &s;he met their gaze. He &s;eemed to meditate on &s;omething horrible, and &s;he gave up all hopes of e&s;caping from the &s;epulchre with life. Yet in harbouring this idea &s;he did him inju&s;tice. Amid&s;t the horror and di&s;|gu&s;t to which his &s;oul was a prey, pity for his victim &s;till held a place in it. The &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion once over, he would have given worlds, had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to have re|&s;tored to her that innocence of which his
<PB N="205" REF="206">
unbridled lu&s;t had deprived her. Of the de&s;ires which had urged him to the crime, no trace was left in his bo&s;om. The wealth of India would not have tempted him to a &s;econd enjoyment of her per&s;on. His na|ture &s;eemed to revolt at the very idea, and fain would he have wiped from his memory the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. As his gloomy rage abated, in proportion did his compa&s;&s;ion augment for Antonia. He &s;topped, and would have &s;poken to her words of comfort; but he knew not from whence to draw them, and remained gazing upon her with mournful wildne&s;s. Her &s;ituation &s;eemed &s;o hopele&s;s, &s;o woe-begone, as to baffle mortal power to relieve her. What could he do for her? Her peace of mind was lo&s;t, her honour irreparably ruin|ed. She was cut off for ever from &s;ociety, nor dared he give her back to it. He was con&s;cious that, were &s;he to appear in the world again, his guilt would be revealed, and his puni&s;hment inevitable. To one &s;o laden with crimes, death came armed
<PB N="206" REF="207">
with double terrors. Yet, &s;hould he re&s;tore Antonia to light, and &s;tand the chance of her betraying him, how mi&s;erable a pro|&s;pect would pre&s;ent it&s;elf before her! She could never hope to be creditably e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; &s;he would be marked with infamy, and condemned to &s;orrow and &s;olitude for the remainder of her exi&s;tence. What was the alternative? A re&s;olution far more ter|rible for Antonia, but which at lea&s;t would in&s;ure the abbot's &s;afety. He determined to leave the world per&s;uaded of her death, and to retain her a captive in this gloomy pri&s;on. There he propo&s;ed to vi&s;it her every night, to bring her food, to profe&s;s his penitence, and mingle his tears with hers. The monk felt that this re&s;olution was unju&s;t and cruel; but it was his only means to prevent Antonia from publi&s;hing his guilt and her own infamy. Should he relea&s;e her, he could not depend upon her &s;ilence. His offence was too flagrant to permit his hoping for her forgivene&s;s. Be|&s;ides, her re-appearing would excite uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="207" REF="208">
curio&s;ity, and the violence of her af|fliction would prevent her from concealing its cau&s;e. He determined, therefore, that Antonia &s;hould remain a pri&s;oner in the dungeon.</P>
<P>He approached her with confu&s;ion paint|ed on his countenance. He rai&s;ed her from the ground&mdash;her hand trembled as he took it, and he dropped it again as if he had touched a &s;erpent. Nature &s;eemed to re|coil at the touch. He felt him&s;elf at once repul&s;ed from and attracted towards her, yet could account for neither &s;entiment. There was &s;omething in her look which pe|netrated him with horror; and though his under&s;tanding was &s;till ignorant of it, con|&s;cience pointed out to him the whole extent of his crime. In hurried accents, yet the gentle&s;t he could find, while his eye was averted, and his voice &s;carcely audible, he &s;trove to con&s;ole her under a misfortune which now could not be avoided. He de|clared him&s;elf &s;incerely penitent, and that he would gladly &s;hed a drop of his blood
<PB N="208" REF="209">
for every tear which his barbarity had forced from her. Wretched and hopele&s;s, Antonia li&s;tened to him in &s;ilent grief; but when he announced her confinement in the &s;epul|chre, that dreadful doom, to which even death &s;eemed preferable, rou&s;ed her from her in&s;en&s;ibility at once. To linger out a life of mi&s;ery in a narrow loath&s;ome cell, known to exi&s;t by no human being &s;ave her ravi&s;her, &s;urrounded by mouldering cor&s;es, breathing the pe&s;tilential air of cor|ruption, never more to behold the light, or drink the pure gale of heaven&mdash;the idea was more terrible than &s;he could &s;upport. It conquered even her abhorrence of the friar. Again &s;he &s;ank upon her knees; &s;he be&s;ought his compa&s;&s;ion in terms the mo&s;t pathetic and urgent: &s;he promi&s;ed, would he but re&s;tore her to liberty, to conceal her injuries from the world; to a&s;&s;ign any rea|&s;ons for her re-appearance, which he might judge proper; and in order to prevent th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion from falling upon him, &s;he offered to quit Madrid immediately. Her
<PB N="209" REF="210">
entreaties were &s;o urgent as to make a con|&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon the monk. He reflected, that as her per&s;on no longer ex|cited his de&s;ires, he had no intere&s;t in keep|ing her concealed as he had at fir&s;t intend|ed; that he was adding a fre&s;h injury to tho&s;e which &s;he had already &s;uffered; and that if &s;he adhered to her promi&s;es, whether &s;he was confined or at liberty, his life and re|putation were equally &s;ecure. On the other hand, he trembled le&s;t in her affliction An|tonia &s;hould unintentionally break her en|gagement, or that her exce&s;&s;ive &s;implicity and ignorance of deceit &s;hould permit &s;ome one more artful to &s;urpri&s;e her &s;ecret. However well-founded were the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions, compa&s;&s;ion, and a &s;incere wi&s;h to repair his fault as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;olicited his complying with the prayers of his &s;up|pliant. The difficulty of colouring Anto|nia's unexpected return to life, after her &s;uppo&s;ed death and public interment, was the only point which kept him irre&s;olute. He was &s;till pondering on the means of re|moving
<PB N="210" REF="211">
this ob&s;tacle, when he heard the &s;ound of feet approaching with precipita|tion. The door of the vault was thrown open, and Matilda ru&s;hed in, evidently much confu&s;ed and terrified.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing a &s;tranger enter, Antonia ut|tered a cry of joy; but her hopes of receiv|ing &s;uccour from him were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. The &s;uppo&s;ed novice, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e at finding a woman alone with the monk, in &s;o &s;trange a place, and at &s;o late an hour, addre&s;&s;ed him thus with|out lo&s;ing a moment:</P>
<P>"What is to be done, Ambro&s;io? We are lo&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy means is found of di&s;pelling the rioters. Ambro&s;io, the convent of St. Clare is on fire; the priore&s;s is fallen a victim to the fury of the mob. Already is the abbey menaced with a &s;imilar fate. Alarmed at the threats of the people, the monks &s;eek for you every where. They imagine that your authority alone will &s;uffice to calm this di&s;turbance. No one knows what is become of you, and your

ab&s;ence creates univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. I profited by the confu&s;ion, and fled hither to warn you of the danger."</P>
<P>"This will &s;oon be remedied," an&s;wered the abbot; "I will ha&s;ten back to my cell: a trivial rea&s;on will account for my having been mi&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" rejoined Matilda: "The &s;epulchre is filled with archers. Lorenzo de Medina, with &s;everal officers of the In|qui&s;ition, &s;earches through the vaults, and pervades every pa&s;&s;age. You will be in|tercepted in your flight; your rea&s;ons for being at this late hour in the &s;epulchre will be examined; Antonia will be found, and then you are undone for ever!"</P>
<P>"Lorenzo de Medina? Officers of the Inqui&s;ition? What brings them here? Seek they for me? Am I then &s;u&s;pected? Oh! &s;peak, Matilda! an&s;wer me in pity!"</P>
<P>"As yet they do not think of you; but I fear that they will ere long. Your only chance of e&s;caping their notice re&s;ts upon the difficulty of exploring this vault. The
<PB N="212" REF="213">
door is artfully hidden; haply it may not be ob&s;erved, and we may remain concealed till the &s;earch is over."</P>
<P>"But Antonia . . . . . Should the inqui|&s;itors draw near, and her cries be heard . . ."</P>
<P>"Thus I remove that danger!" inter|rupted Matilda.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time drawing a poniard, &s;he ru&s;hed upon her devoted prey.</P>
<P>"Hold! hold!" cried Ambro&s;io, &s;eizing her hand, and wre&s;ting from it the already lifted weapon. "What would you do, cruel woman? The unfortunate has already &s;uffered but too much, thanks to your per|nicious coun&s;els! Would to God that I had never followed them! Would to God that I had never &s;een your face!"</P>
<P>Matilda darted upon him a look of &s;corn.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd!" &s;he exclaimed with an air of pa&s;&s;ion and maje&s;ty, which impre&s;&s;ed the monk with awe. "After robbing her of all that made it dear, can you fear to de|prive her of a life &s;o mi&s;erable? But 'tis
<PB N="213" REF="214">
well! Let her live to convince you of your folly. I abandon you to your evil de&s;tiny! I di&s;claim your alliance! Who trembles to commit &s;o in&s;ignificant a crime, de&s;erves not my protection. Hark! hark! Ambro|&s;io; hear you not the archers? They come, and your de&s;truction is inevitable!"</P>
<P>At this moment the abbot heard the &s;ound of di&s;tant voices. He flew to clo&s;e the door, on who&s;e concealment his &s;afety depended, and which Matilda had neglect|ed to fa&s;ten. Ere he could reach it, he &s;aw Antonia glide &s;uddenly by him, ru&s;h through the door, and fly towards the noi&s;e with the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow. She had li&s;tened attentively to Matilda: &s;he heard Lorenzo's name mentioned, and re&s;olved to ri&s;que every thing to throw her&s;elf under his protection. The door was open. The &s;ounds convinced her that the archers could be at no great di&s;tance. She mu&s;tered up her little remaining &s;trength, ru&s;hed by the monk ere he perceived her de&s;ign, and bent her cour&s;e rapidly towards the voices. As
<PB N="214" REF="215">
&s;oon as he recovered from his fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, the abbot failed not to pur&s;ue her. In vain did Antonia redouble her &s;peed, and &s;tretch every nerve to the utmo&s;t. Her enemy gained upon her every moment: &s;he heard his &s;teps clo&s;e after her, and felt the heat of his breath glow upon her neck. He over|took her; he twi&s;ted his hand in the ringlets of her &s;treaming hair, and attempted to drag her back with him to the dungeon. Antonia re&s;i&s;ted with all her &s;trength. She folded her arms round a pillar which &s;up|ported the roof, and &s;hrieked loudly for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. In vain did the monk &s;trive to threaten her to &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Help!" &s;he continued to exclaim; "help! help! for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>Quickened by her cries, the &s;ound of foot-&s;teps was heard approaching. The abbot expected every moment to &s;ee the inqui&s;itors arrive. Antonia &s;till re&s;i&s;ted, and he now enforced her &s;ilence by means the mo&s;t horrible and inhuman. He &s;till gra&s;ped Matilda's dagger: without al|lowing
<PB N="215" REF="216">
him&s;el a moment's reflection, he rai&s;ed it, and plunged it twice in the bo&s;om of Antonia! She &s;hrieked, and &s;ank upon the ground. The monk endeavoured to bear her away with him, but me &s;till em|braced the pillar firmly. At that in&s;tant the light of approaching torches fla&s;hed upon the walls. Dreading a di&s;covery, Ambro&s;io was compelled to abandon his victim, and ha&s;tily fled back to the vault, where he had left Matilda.</P>
<P>He fled not unob&s;erved. Don Ramirez happening to arrive the fir&s;t, perceived a female bleeding upon the ground, and a man flying from the &s;pot, who&s;e confu&s;ion betrayed him for the murderer. He in|&s;tantly pur&s;ued the fugitive, with &s;ome part of the archers, while the others remained with Lorenzo to protect the wounded &s;tranger. They rai&s;ed her, and &s;upported her in their arms. She had fainted from exce&s;s of pain, but &s;oon gave &s;igns of re|turning life. She opened her eyes; and on lifting up her head, the quantity of fair hair
<PB N="216" REF="217">
fell back, which till then had ob&s;cured her features.</P>
<P>"God Almighty! it is Antonia!"</P>
<P>Such was Lorenzo's exclamation, while he &s;natched her from the attendant's arms, and cla&s;ped her in his own.</P>
<P>Though aimed by an uncertain hand, the poniard had an&s;wered but too well the purpo&s;e of its employer. The wounds were mortal, and Antonia was con&s;cious that &s;he never could recover. Yet the few moments which remained for her, were moments of happine&s;s. The concern ex|pre&s;&s;ed upon Lorenzo's countenance, the frantic fondne&s;s of his complaints, and his earne&s;t enquiries re&s;pecting her wounds, convinced her beyond a doubt that his af|fections were her own. She would not be removed from the vaults, fearing le&s;t mo|tion &s;hould only ha&s;ten her death; and &s;he was unwilling to lo&s;e tho&s;e moments which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in receiving proofs of Lorenzo's love, and a&s;&s;uring him of her own. She told him, that had &s;he &s;till been undefiled &s;he
<PB N="217" REF="218">
might have lamented the lo&s;s of life; but that, deprived of honour and branded with &s;hame, death was to her a ble&s;&s;ing: &s;he could not have been his wife; and that hope being denied her, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the grave without one &s;igh of regret. She bade him take courage, conjured him not to abandon him&s;elf to fruitle&s;s &s;orrow, and declared that &s;he mourned to leave nothing in the whole world but him. While every &s;weet accent increa&s;ed rather than lightened Lorenzo's grief, &s;he continued to conver&s;e with him till the moment of di&s;&s;olution. Her voice grew faint, and &s;carcely audible; a thick cloud &s;pread it&s;elf over her eyes; her heart beat &s;low and irregular, and every in&s;tant &s;eemed to announce that her fate was near at hand.</P>
<P>She lay, her head reclining upon Loren|zo's bo&s;om, and her lips &s;till murmuring to him words of comfort. She was inter|rupted by the convent-bell, as, tolling at a di&s;tance, it &s;truck the hour. Suddenly Antonia's eyes &s;parkled with cele&s;tial bright|ne&s;s;
<PB N="218" REF="219">
her frame &s;eemed to have received new &s;trength and animation. She &s;tarted from her lover's arms.</P>
<P>"Three o'clock!" &s;he cried. "Mother, I come!"</P>
<P>She cla&s;ped her hands, and &s;ank lifele&s;s upon the ground. Lorenzo, in agony, threw him&s;elf be&s;ide her. He tore his hair, beat his brea&s;t, and refu&s;ed to be &s;eparated from the cor&s;e. At length his force being exhau&s;ted, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led from the vault, and was conveyed to the palace de Medina &s;carcely more alive than the unfortunate Antonia.</P>
<P>In the mean while, though clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued, Ambro&s;io &s;ucceeded in regaining the vault. The door was already fa&s;tened when Don Ramirez arrived, and much time elap&s;ed ere the fugitive's retreat was di&s;covered. But nothing can re&s;i&s;t per&s;e|verance. Though &s;o artfully concealed, the door could not e&s;cape the vigilance of the archers. They forced it open, and en|tered the vault to the infinite di&s;may of

Ambro&s;io and his companion. The monk's confu&s;ion, his attempt to hide him&s;elf, his rapid flight, and the blood &s;prinkled upon his clothes, left no room to doubt his being Antonia's murderer. But when he was recognized for the immaculate Ambro&s;io, "the man of holine&s;s," the idol of Madrid; the faculties of the &s;pectators were chained up in &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;carcely could they per|&s;uade them&s;elves that what they &s;aw was no vi&s;ion. The abbot &s;trove not to vindicate him&s;elf, but pre&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence. He was &s;ecured and bound. The &s;ame pre|caution was taken with Matilda. Her cowl being removed, the delicacy of her features and profu&s;ion of her golden hair betrayed her &s;ex; and this incident created fre&s;h amazement. The dagger was al&s;o found in the tomb, where the monk had thrown it; and the dungeon having undergone a thorough &s;earch, the two culprits were con|veyed to the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez took care that the popu|lace &s;hould remain ignorant both of the

crimes and profe&s;&s;ion of the captives. He feared a repetition of the riots, which had followed the apprehending the priore&s;s of St. Clare. He contented him&s;elf with &s;tat|ing to the Capuchins the guilt of their &s;u|perior. To avoid the &s;hame of a public ac|cu&s;ation, and dreading the popular fury, from which they had already &s;aved their abbey with much difficulty, the monks rea|dily permitted the inqui&s;itors to &s;earch their man&s;ion without noi&s;e. No fre&s;h di&s;cove|ries were made. The effects found in the abbot's and Matilda's cells were &s;eized, and carried to the Inqui&s;ition to be produced in evidence. Every thing el&s;e remained in its former po&s;ition, and order and tranquillity once more prevailed through Madrid.</P>
<P>St. Clare's convent was completely ruin|ed by the united ravages of the mob and conflagration. Nothing remained of it but the principal walls, who&s;e thickne&s;s and &s;o|lidity had pre&s;erved them from the flames. The nuns who had belonged to it were obliged, in con&s;equence, to di&s;per&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="221" REF="222">
into other &s;ocieties: but the prejudice again&s;t them ran high, and the &s;uperiors were very unwilling to admit them. How|ever, mo&s;t of them being related to families the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their riches, birth, and power, the &s;everal convents were compelled to receive them, though they did it with a very ill grace. This prejudice was extremely fal&s;e and unju&s;tifiable. After a clo&s;e inve&s;tigation, it was proved that all in the convent were per&s;uaded of the death of Agnes, except the four nuns whom St. Ur&s;ula had pointed out. The&s;e had fallen victims to the popular fury, as had al&s;o &s;e|veral who were perfectly innocent and un|con&s;cious of the whole affair. Blinded by re&s;entment, the mob had &s;acrificed every nun who fell into their hands: they who e&s;caped were entirely indebted to the duke de Medina's prudence and moderation. Of this they were con&s;cious, and felt for that nobleman a proper &s;en&s;e of grati|tude.</P>
<P>Virginia was not the mo&s;t &s;paring of her
<PB N="222" REF="223">
thanks; &s;he wi&s;hed equally to make a pro|per return for his attentions, and to obtain the good graces of Lorenzo's uncle. In this &s;he ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded. The duke be|held her beauty with wonder and admi|ration; and while his eyes were enchanted with her form, the &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, and her tender concern for the &s;uffering nun, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his heart in her favour. This Virginia had di&s;cernment enough to perceive, and &s;he redoubled her attention to the invalid. When he parted from her at the door of her father's palace, the duke entreated permi&s;&s;ion to enquire occa&s;ionally after her health. His reque&s;t was readily granted; Virginia a&s;&s;ured him, that the marquis de Villa-Franca would be proud of an opportunity to thank him in per&s;on for the protection afforded to her. They now &s;eparated, he enchanted with her beauty and gentlene&s;s, and &s;he much plea&s;ed with him and more with his nephew.</P>
<P>On entering the palace, Virginia's fir&s;t care was to &s;ummon the family phy&s;ician,
<PB N="223" REF="224">
and take care of her unknown charge. He mother ha&s;tened to &s;hare with her the chari|table office. Alarmed by the riots, and trembling for his daughter's &s;afety, who was his only child, the marquis had flown to St. Clare's convent, and was &s;till employed in &s;eeking her. Me&s;&s;engers were now di&s;|patched on all &s;ides to inform him, that he would find her &s;afe at his hotel, and de&s;ire him to ha&s;ten thither immediately. His ab&s;ence gave Virginia liberty to be&s;tow her whole attention upon her patient; and though much di&s;ordered her&s;elf by the ad|ventures of the night, no per&s;ua&s;ion could induce her to quit the bed-&s;ide of the &s;uf|ferer. Her con&s;titution being much en|feebled by want and &s;orrow, it was &s;ome time before the &s;tranger was re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es. She found great difficulty in &s;wal|lowing the medicines pre&s;cribed to her; but this ob&s;tacle being removed, &s;he ea&s;ily conquered her di&s;ea&s;e, which proceeded from nothing but weakne&s;s. The attention which was paid her, the whole&s;ome food
<PB N="224" REF="225">
to which &s;he had been long a &s;tranger, and her joy at being re&s;tored to liberty, to &s;o|ciety, and, as &s;he dared to hope, to love, all this combined to her &s;peedy re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. From the fir&s;t moment of knowing her, her melancholy &s;ituation, her &s;ufferings almo&s;t unparalleled, had engaged the affec|tions of her amiable ho&s;te&s;s. Virginia felt for her the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t: but how was &s;he delighted, when, her gue&s;t being &s;ufficiently recovered to relate her hi&s;tory, &s;he recognized in the captive nun the &s;i&s;ter of Lorenzo!</P>
<P>This victim of mona&s;tic cruelty was in|deed no other than the unfortunate Agnes. During her abode in the convent, &s;he had been well known to Virginia; but her ema|ciated form, her features altered by afflic|tion, her death univer&s;ally credited, and her overgrown and matted hair which hung over her face and bo&s;om in di&s;order, at fir&s;t had prevented her being recollected. The priore&s;s had put every artifice in practice to induce Virginia to take the veil; for the
<PB N="225" REF="226">
heire&s;s of Villa-Franca would have been no de&s;picable acqui&s;ition. Her &s;eeming kind|ne&s;s and unremitted attention &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded, that her young relation began to think &s;eriou&s;ly upon compliance. Better in&s;tructed in the di&s;gu&s;t and ennui of a mo|na&s;tic life, Agnes had penetrated the de|&s;igns of the domina. She trembled for the innocent girl, and endeavoured to make her &s;en&s;ible of her error. She painted in their true colours the numerous incon|veniencies attached to a convent, the con|tinued re&s;traint, the low jealou&s;ies, the pet|ty intrigues, the &s;ervile court and gro&s;s flattery expected by the &s;uperior. She then bade Virginia reflect on the brilliant pro|&s;pect which pre&s;ented it&s;elf before her. The idol of her parents, the admiration of Ma|drid, endowed by nature and education with every perfection of per&s;on and mind, &s;he might look forward to an e&s;tabli&s;hment the mo&s;t fortunate. Her riches furni&s;hed her with the means of exerci&s;ing, in their fulle&s;t extent, charity and benevolence,
<PB N="226" REF="227">
tho&s;e virtues &s;o dear to her; and her &s;tay in the world would enable her di&s;covering objects worthy her protection, which could not be done in the &s;eclu&s;ion of a convent.</P>
<P>Her per&s;ua&s;ions induced Virginia to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the veil: but another argument, not u&s;ed by Agnes, had more weight with her than all the others put to|gether. She had &s;een Lorenzo when he vi&s;ited his &s;i&s;ter at the grate; his per&s;on plea&s;ed her, and her conver&s;ations with Agnes generally u&s;ed to terminate in &s;ome que&s;tion about her brother. She, who doted upon Lorenzo, wi&s;hed for no better than an opportunity to trumpet out his prai&s;e. She &s;poke of him in terms of rap|ture; and, to convince her auditor how ju&s;t were his &s;entiments, how cultivated his mind, and elegant his expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he &s;hewed her at different times the letters which &s;he received from him. She &s;oon perceived that from the&s;e communications the heart of her young friend had imbibed impre&s;&s;ions which &s;he was far from intend|ing
<PB N="227" REF="228">
to give, but was truly happy to di&s;co|ver. She could not have wi&s;hed her bro|ther a more de&s;irable union: heire&s;s of Villa-Franca, virtuous, affectionate, beauti|ful, and accompli&s;hed, Virginia &s;eemed calculated to make him happy. She &s;ound|ed her brother upon the &s;ubject, though without mentioning names or circum&s;tances. He a&s;&s;ured her in his an&s;wers, that his heart and hand were totally di&s;engaged, and &s;he thought that upon the&s;e grounds &s;he might proceed without danger. She in con&s;e|quence endeavoured to &s;trengthen the dawning pa&s;&s;ion of her friend. Lorenzo was made the con&s;tant topic of her di&s;|cour&s;e; and the avidity with which her au|ditor li&s;tened, the &s;ighs which frequently e&s;caped from her bo&s;om, and the eagerne&s;s with which upon any digre&s;&s;ion &s;he brought back the conver&s;ation to the &s;ubject whence it had wandered, &s;ufficed to convince Ag|nes that her brother's addre&s;&s;es would be far from di&s;agreeable. She at length ven|tured
<PB N="228" REF="229">
to mention her wi&s;hes to the duke. Though a &s;tranger to the lady her&s;elf, he knew enough of her &s;ituation to think her worthy his nephew's hand. It was agreed between him and his niece, that &s;he &s;hould in&s;inuate the idea to Lorenzo, and &s;he only waited his return to Madrid to propo&s;e her friend to him as his bride. The unfortu|nate events which took place in the interim, prevented her from executing her de&s;ign. Virginia wept her lo&s;s &s;incerely, both as a companion, and as the only per&s;on to whom &s;he could &s;peak of Lorenzo. Her pa&s;&s;ion continued to prey upon her heart in &s;ecret, and &s;he had almo&s;t determined to confe&s;s her &s;entiments to her mother, when acci|dent once more threw their object in her way. The &s;ight of him &s;o near her, his politene&s;s, his compa&s;&s;ion, his intrepidity, had com|bined to give new ardour to her affection. When &s;he now found her friend and advo|cate re&s;tored to her, &s;he looked upon her as a gift from Heaven; &s;he ventured to che|ri&s;h
<PB N="229" REF="230">
the hope of being united to Lorenzo, and re&s;olved to u&s;e with him his &s;i&s;ter's in|fluence.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that before her death Agnes might po&s;&s;ibly have made the propo&s;al, the duke had placed all his nephew's hints of marriage to Virginia's account; con&s;equent|ly he gave them the mo&s;t favourable re|ception. On returning to his hotel, the re|lation given him of Antonia's death, and Lorenzo's behaviour on the occa&s;ion, made evident his mi&s;take. He lamented the cir|cum&s;tances; but the unhappy girl being effectually out of the way, he tru&s;ted that his de&s;igns would yet be executed. 'Tis true that Lorenzo's &s;ituation ju&s;t then ill &s;uited him for a bridegroom. His hopes di&s;appointed at the moment when he ex|pected to realize them, and the dreadful and &s;udden death of his mi&s;tre&s;s, had affect|ed him very &s;everely. The duke found him upon the bed of &s;ickne&s;s. His atten|dants expre&s;&s;ed &s;erious apprehen&s;ions for his life; but the uncle entertained not the
<PB N="230" REF="231">
&s;ame fears. He was of opinion, and not unwi&s;ely, that "men have died, and worms have ate them, but not for love!" He there|fore flattered him&s;elf, that however deep might be the impre&s;&s;ion made upon his nephew's heart, time and Virginia would be able to efface it. He now ha&s;tened to the afflicted youth, and endeavoured to con&s;ole him: he &s;ympathi&s;ed in his di&s;tre&s;s, but encouraged him to re&s;i&s;t the enaroachments of de&s;pair. He allowed, that he could not but feel &s;hocked at an event &s;o terrible, nor could he blame his &s;en&s;ibility; but he be|&s;ought him not to torment him&s;elf with vain regrets, and rather to &s;truggle with af|fliction, and pre&s;erve his life, if not for his own &s;ake, at lea&s;t for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who were fondly attached to him. While he laboured thus to make Lorenzo forget An|tonia's lo&s;s, the duke paid his court a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly to Virginia, and &s;eized every oppor|tunity to advance his nephew's intere&s;t in her heart.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be expected that Agnes
<PB N="231" REF="232">
was not long without enquiring after Don Raymond. She was &s;hocked to hear the wretched &s;ituation to which grief had re|duced him; yet &s;he could not help exult|ing &s;ecretly, when &s;he reflected that his illne&s;s proved the &s;incerity of his love. The duke undertook the office him&s;elf, of announcing to the invalid the happine&s;s which awaited him. Though he omitted no precaution to prepare him for &s;uch an event, at this &s;udden change from de&s;pair to happine&s;s, Raymond's tran&s;ports were &s;o violent, as nearly to have proved fatal to him. The&s;e once pa&s;&s;ed, the tranquillity of his mind, the a&s;&s;urance of felicity, and above all, the pre&s;ence of Agnes, (who was no &s;ooner re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by the care of Virginia and the marchione&s;s, than &s;he ha&s;t|ened to attend her lover) &s;oon enabled him to overcome the effects of his late dreadful malady. The calm of his &s;oul communicated it&s;elf to his body, and he recovered with &s;uch rapidity as to create univer&s;al &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">Not &s;o Lorenzo. Antonia's death, ac|companied with &s;uch terrible circum&s;tances, weighed upon his mind heavily. He was worn down to a &s;hadow; nothing could give him plea&s;ure. He was per&s;uaded with difficulty to &s;wallow nouri&s;hment &s;uf|ficient for the &s;upport of life, and a con|&s;umption was apprehended. The &s;ociety of Agnes formed his only comfort. Though accident had never permitted their being much together, he entertained for her a &s;in|cere friend&s;hip and attachment. Perceiv|ing how nece&s;&s;ary &s;he was to him, &s;he &s;el|dom quitted his chamber. She li&s;tened to his complaints with unwearied attention, and &s;oothed him by the gentlene&s;s of her manners, and by &s;ympathi&s;ing with his di&s;|tre&s;s. She &s;till inhabited the palace de Villa-Franca, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of which treat|ed her with marked affection. The duke had intimated to the marquis his wi&s;hes re&s;pecting Virginia. The match was un|exceptionable; Lorenzo was heir to his uncle's immen&s;e property, and was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="233" REF="234">
in Madrid for his agreeable per|&s;on, exten&s;ive knowledge, and propriety of conduct. Add to this, that the mar|chione&s;s had di&s;covered how &s;trong was her daughter's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his fa|vour.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, the duke's propo&s;al was accepted without he&s;itation: every precau|tion was taken to induce Lorenzo's &s;eeing the lady with tho&s;e &s;entiments which &s;he &s;o well merited to excite. In her vi&s;its to her brother, Agnes was frequently accom|panied by the marchione&s;s; and as &s;oon as he was able to move into his antichamber, Virginia, under her mother's protection, was &s;ometimes permitted to expre&s;s her wi&s;hes for his recovery. This &s;he did with &s;uch delicacy, the manner in which &s;he mentioned Antonia was &s;o tender and &s;ooth|ing, and when &s;he lamented her rival's me|lancholy fate, her bright eyes &s;hone &s;o beautiful through her tears, that Lorenzo could not behold or li&s;ten to her without emotion. His relations, as well as the lady,
<PB N="234" REF="235">
perceived that with every day her &s;ociety &s;eemed to give him fre&s;h plea&s;ure, and that he &s;poke of her in terms of &s;tronger admi|ration. However, they prudently kept their ob&s;ervations to them&s;elves. No word was dropped, which might lead him to &s;u&s;|pect their de&s;igns. They continued their former conduct and attention, and left time to ripen into a warmer &s;entiment the friend|&s;hip which he already felt for Virginia.</P>
<P>In the mean while, her vi&s;its became more frequent; and latterly there was &s;carce a day, of which &s;he did not pa&s;s &s;ome part by the &s;ide of Lorenzo's couch. He gra|dually regained his &s;trength, but the pro|gre&s;s of his recovery was &s;low and doubt|ful. One evening he &s;eemed to be in bet|ter &s;pirits than u&s;ual: Agnes and her lover, the duke, Virginia, and her parents were &s;itting round him. He now for the fir&s;t time entreated his &s;i&s;ter to inform him how &s;he had e&s;caped the effects of the poi&s;on which St. Ur&s;ula had &s;een her &s;wallow. Fearful of recalling tho&s;e &s;cenes to his mind
<PB N="235" REF="236">
in which Antonia had peri&s;hed, &s;he had hitherto concealed from him the hi&s;tory of her &s;ufferings. As he now &s;tarted the &s;ub|ject him&s;elf, and thinking that perhaps the narrative of her &s;orrows might draw him from the contemplation of tho&s;e on which he dwelt too con&s;tantly, &s;he immediately complied with his reque&s;t. The re&s;t of the company had already heard her &s;tory: but the intere&s;t which all pre&s;ent felt for its he|roine, made them anxious to hear it re|peated. The whole &s;ociety &s;econding Lo|renzo's entreaties, Agnes obeyed. She fir&s;t recounted the di&s;covery which had taken place in the abbey chapel, the domina's re|&s;entment, and the midnight &s;cene of which St. Ur&s;ula had been a concealed witne&s;s. Though the nun had already de&s;cribed this latter event, Agnes now related it more cir|cum&s;tantially, and at large. After which &s;he proceeded in her narrative as follows:</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF AGNES DE MEDINA.</HEAD>
<P>MY &s;uppo&s;ed death was attended with the greate&s;t agonies. Tho&s;e moments which I believed my la&s;t were embittered by the domina's a&s;&s;urances that I could not e&s;cape perdition; and as my eyes clo&s;ed, I heard her rage exhale it&s;elf in cur&s;es on my of|fence. The horror of this &s;ituation, of a death-bed from which hope was bani&s;hed, of a &s;leep from which I was only to wake to find my&s;elf the prey of flames and furies, was more dreadful than I can de&s;cribe. When animation revived in me, my &s;oul was &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e terrible ideas. I looked round with fear, expecting to behold the mini&s;ters of divine vengeance. For the fir&s;t hour, my &s;en&s;es were &s;o bewil|dered, and my brain &s;o dizzy, that I &s;trove in vain to arrange the &s;trange images which floated in wild confu&s;ion before me. If I endeavoured to rai&s;e my&s;elf from the ground, the wandering of my head deceived
<PB N="237" REF="238">
me. Every thing around me &s;eemed to rock, and I &s;ank once more upon the earth. My weak and dazzled eyes were unable to bear a nearer approach to a gleam of light, which I &s;aw trembling above me. I was compelled to clo&s;e them again, and remain motionle&s;s in the &s;ame po&s;ture.</P>
<P>A full hour elap&s;ed, before I was &s;uf|ficiently my&s;elf to examine the &s;urrounding objects. When I did examine them, what terror filled my bo&s;om! I found my&s;elf ex|tended upon a &s;ort of wicker couch. It had &s;ix handles to it, which doubtle&s;s had &s;erved the nuns to convey me to my grave. I was covered with a linen cloth: &s;everal faded flowers were &s;trown over me. On one &s;ide lay a &s;mall wooden crucifix: on the other a ro&s;ary of large beads. Four low narrow walls confined me. The top was al&s;o covered, and in it was fitted a &s;mall grated door, through which was ad|mitted the little air that circulated in this mi&s;erable place. A faint glimmering of light, which &s;treamed through the bars,
<PB N="238" REF="239">
permitted me to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;urround|ing horrors. I was oppre&s;&s;ed by a noi&s;ome &s;uffocating &s;mell; and perceiving that the grated door was unfa&s;tened, I thought that I might po&s;&s;ibly effect my e&s;cape. As I rai&s;ed my&s;elf with this de&s;ign, my hand re&s;ted upon &s;omething &s;oft: I gra&s;ped it, and advanced it towards the light. Al|mighty God! what was my di&s;gu&s;t! my con&s;ternation! In &s;pite of its putridity, and the worms which preyed upon it, I perceived a corrupted human head, and re|cogni&s;ed the features of a nun who had died &s;ome months before. I threw it from me, and &s;ank almo&s;t lifele&s;s upon my bier.</P>
<P>When my &s;trength returned, this cir|cum&s;tance, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being &s;urrounded by the loath&s;ome and moulder|ing bodies of my companions, increa&s;ed my de&s;ire to e&s;cape from my fearful pri&s;on. I again moved towards the light. The grated door was within my reach. I lifted it without difficulty: probably it had been left unclo&s;ed, to facilitate my quitting the
<PB N="239" REF="240">
dungeon. Aiding my&s;elf by the irregu|larity of the walls, &s;ome of who&s;e &s;tones projected beyond the re&s;t, I contrived to a&s;cend them, and drag my&s;elf out of my pri&s;on. I now found my&s;elf in a vault to|lerably &s;pacious. Several tombs, &s;imilar in appearance to that whence I had ju&s;t e&s;caped, were ranged along the &s;ides in order, and &s;eemed to be con&s;iderably &s;unk within the earth. A &s;epulchral lamp was &s;u&s;pended from the roof by an iron chain, and &s;hed a gloomy light through the dungeon. Em|blems of death were &s;een on every &s;ide: &s;kulls, &s;houlder-blades, thigh-bones, and other reliques of mortality, were &s;cattered upon the dewy ground. Each tomb was ornamented with a large crucifix, and in one corner &s;tood a wooden &s;tatue of St. Clare. To the&s;e objects I at fir&s;t paid no attention: a door, the only outlet from the vault, had attracted my eyes. I ha&s;tened towards it, having wrapped my winding-&s;heet clo&s;ely round me. I pu&s;hed again&s;t the door, and to my inexpre&s;&s;ible terror found that it was fa&s;tened on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241">I gue&s;&s;ed immediately, that the priore&s;s, mi&s;taking the nature of the liquor which &s;he had compelled me to drink, in&s;tead of poi&s;on had admini&s;tered a &s;trong opiate. From this I concluded that, being to all appearance dead, I had received the rites of burial; and that, deprived of the power of making my exi&s;tence known, it would be my fate to expire of hunger. This idea penetrated me with horror, not merely for my own &s;ake, but that of the innocent creature who &s;till lived within my bo&s;om. I again endeavoured to open the door, but it re&s;i&s;ted all my efforts. I &s;tretched my voice to the extent of its compa&s;s, and &s;hrieked for aid. I was remote from the hearing of every one. No friendly voice replied to mine. A profound and melan|choly &s;ilence prevailed through the vault, and I de&s;paired of liberty. My long ab&s;ti|nence from food now began to torment me. The tortures which hunger inflicted on me, were the mo&s;t painful and in&s;up|portable: yet they &s;eemed to increa&s;e with every hour which pa&s;&s;ed over my head.
<PB N="241" REF="242">
Sometimes I threw my&s;elf upon the ground, and rolled upon it wild and de&s;perate: &s;ometimes &s;tarting up, I returned to the door, again &s;trove to force it open, and re|peated my fruitle&s;s cries for &s;uccour. Often was I on the point of &s;triking my temple again&s;t the &s;harp corner of &s;ome monument, da&s;hing out my brains, and thus terminating my woes at once. But &s;till the remem|brance of my baby vanqui&s;hed my re&s;olu|tion. I trembled at a deed, which equally endangered my child's exi&s;tence and my own. Then would I vent my angui&s;h in loud exclamations and pa&s;&s;ionate com|plaints; and then again my &s;trength failing me, &s;ilent and hopele&s;s I would &s;it me down upon the ba&s;e of St. Clare's &s;tatue, fold my arms, and abandon my&s;elf to &s;ul|len de&s;pair. Thus pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal wretched hours. Death advanced towards me with rapid &s;trides, and I expected that every &s;ucceeding moment would be that of my di&s;&s;olution. Suddenly a neighbouring tomb caught my eye: a ba&s;ket &s;tood upon it,

which till then I had not ob&s;erved. I &s;tarted from my &s;eat: I made towards it as &s;wiftly as my exhau&s;ted frame would per|mit. How eagerly did I &s;eize the ba&s;ket, on finding it to contain a loaf of coar&s;e bread and a &s;mall bottle of water!</P>
<P>I threw my&s;elf with avidity upon the&s;e humble aliments. They had to all appear|ance been placed in the vault for &s;everal days. The bread was hard, and the water tainted: yet never did I ta&s;te food to me &s;o delicious. When the cravings of appe|tite were &s;atisfied, I bu&s;ied my&s;elf with conjectures upon this new circum&s;tance. I debated whether the ba&s;ket had been placed there with a view to my nece&s;&s;ity. Hope an&s;wered my doubts in the affirmative. Yet who could gue&s;s me to be in need of &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance? If my exi&s;tence was known, why was I detained in this gloomy vault? If I was kept a pri&s;oner, what meant the ceremony of committing me to the tomb? Or if I was doomed to peri&s;h with hunger, to who&s;e pity was I indebted for provi&s;ions

placed within my reach? A friend would not have kept my dreadful puni&s;hment a &s;ecret: neither did it &s;eem probable that an enemy would have taken pains to &s;up|ply me with the means of exi&s;tence. Upon the whole I was inclined to think, that the domina's de&s;igns upon my life had been di&s;covered by &s;ome one of my parti&s;ans in the convent, who had found means to &s;ub|&s;titute an opiate for poi&s;on; that &s;he had furni&s;hed me with food to &s;upport me, till &s;he could effect my delivery; and that &s;he was then employed in giving intelli|gence to my relations of my danger, and pointing out a way to relea&s;e me from cap|tivity. Yet why then was the quality of my provi&s;ions &s;o coar&s;e? How could my friend have entered the vault without the domina's knowledge? and if &s;he had en|tered, why was the door fa&s;tened &s;o care|fully? The&s;e reflexions &s;taggered me: yet &s;till this idea was the mo&s;t favourable to my hopes, and I dwelt upon it in prefer|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245">My meditations were interrupted by the &s;ound of di&s;tant foot-&s;teps. They ap|proached, but &s;lowly. Rays of light now darted through the crevices of the door. Uncertain whether the per&s;ons who ad|vanced came to relieve me, or were con|ducted by &s;ome other motive to the vault, I failed not to attract their notice by loud cries for help. Still the &s;ounds drew near. The light grew &s;tronger. At length with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure I heard the key turn|ing in the lock. Per&s;uaded that my de|liverance was at hand, I flew towards the door with a &s;hriek of joy. It opened: but all my hopes of e&s;cape died away, when the priore&s;s appeared followed by the &s;ame four nuns who had been witne&s;&s;es of my &s;uppo&s;ed death. They bore torches in their hands, and gazed upon me in fearful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted back in terror. The domina de&s;cended into the vault, as did al&s;o her companions. She bent upon me a &s;tern re&s;entful eye, but expre&s;&s;ed no &s;urpri&s;e at
<PB N="245" REF="246">
finding me &s;till living. She took the &s;eat which I had ju&s;t quitted. The door was again clo&s;ed, and the nuns ranged them|&s;elves behind their &s;uperior, while the glare of their torches, dimmed by the vapours and dampne&s;s of the vault, gilded with cold beams the &s;urrounding monuments. For &s;ome moments all pre&s;erved a dead and &s;olemn &s;ilence. I &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the priore&s;s. At length &s;he beckoned me to advance. Trembling at the &s;everity of her a&s;pect, my &s;trength &s;carce &s;ufficed me to obey her. I drew near, but my limbs were unable to &s;upport their bur|then. I &s;ank upon my knees, I cla&s;ped my hands, and lifted them up to her for mercy, but had no power to articulate a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>She gazed upon me with angry eyes.</P>
<P>"Do I &s;ee a penitent, or a criminal?" &s;he &s;aid at length: "Are tho&s;e hands rai&s;ed in contrition for your crimes, or in fear of meeting their puni&s;hment? Do tho&s;e tears acknowledge the ju&s;tice of your doom, or

only &s;olicit mitigation of your &s;ufferings? I fear me, 'tis the latter!"</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, but kept her eye &s;till fixed upon mine.</P>
<P>"Take courage," &s;he continued; "I wi&s;h not for your death, but your repent|ance. The draught which I admini&s;tered was no poi&s;on, but an opiate. My inten|tion in deceiving you, was to make you feel the agonies of a guilty con&s;cience, had death overtaken you &s;uddenly, while your crimes were &s;till unrepented. You have &s;uffered tho&s;e agonies; I have brought you to be familiar with the &s;harpne&s;s of death, and I tru&s;t that your momentary angui&s;h will prove to you an eternal benefit. It is not my de&s;ign to de&s;troy your immortal &s;oul, or bid you &s;eek the grave, burthened with the weight of &s;ins unexpiated. No, daughter, far from it; I will purify you with whole&s;ome cha&s;ti&s;ement, and furni&s;h you with full lei&s;ure for contrition and remor&s;e.

<P>This exordium led me to expect &s;ome|thing terrible. I trembled, and would have &s;poken to deprecate her wrath; but a motion of the domina commanded me to be &s;ilent. She proceeded:</P>
<P>"Though of late years unju&s;tly neglect|ed, and now oppo&s;ed by many of our mi&s;|guided &s;i&s;ters (whom Heaven convert!) it is my intention to revive the laws of our order in their full force.

me. I an&s;wered only by falling at her feet, and bathing them with tears. The domina, unmoved by my affliction, ro&s;e from her &s;eat with a &s;tately air: &s;he repeat|ed her commands in an ab&s;olute tone; but my exce&s;&s;ive faintne&s;s made me unable to obey her. Mariana and Alix rai&s;ed me from the ground, and carried me forwards in their arms. The priore&s;s moved on, leaning on Violante, and Camilla preceded her with a torch. Thus pa&s;&s;ed our &s;ad pro|ce&s;&s;ion along the pa&s;&s;ages, in &s;ilence only broken by my &s;ighs and groans. We &s;topped before the principal &s;hrine of St. Clare. The &s;tatue was removed from its pede&s;tal, though how I knew not. The nuns afterwards rai&s;ed an iron grate, till then concealed by the image, and let it fall on the other &s;ide with a loud cra&s;h. The awful &s;ound, repeated by the vaults above and caverns below me, rou&s;ed me from the de&s;pondent apathy in which I had been plunged. I looked before me; an aby&s;s pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my affrighted eyes, and a
<PB N="250" REF="251">
&s;teep and narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, whither my conductors were leading me. I &s;hrieked, and &s;tarted back. I implored compa&s;&s;ion, rent the air with my cries, and &s;ummoned both heaven and earth to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In vain! I was hurried down the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and forced into one of the cells which lined the cavern's &s;ides.</P>
<P>My blood ran cold, as I gazed upon this melancholy abode. The cold vapours hovering in the air, the walls green with damp, the bed of &s;traw &s;o forlorn and com|fortle&s;s, the chain de&s;tined to bind me for ever to my pri&s;on, and the reptiles of every de&s;cription, which, as the torches advanced towards them, I de&s;cried hurrying to their retreats, &s;truck my heart with terrors almo&s;t too exqui&s;ite for nature to bear. Driven by de&s;pair to madne&s;s, I bur&s;t &s;uddenly from the nuns who held me; I threw my|&s;elf upon my knees before the priore&s;s, and be&s;ought her mercy in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and frantic terms.</P>
<P>"If not on me," &s;aid I, "look at lea&s;t
<PB N="251" REF="252">
with pity on that innocent being, who&s;e life is attached to mine! Great is my crime, but let not my child &s;uffer for it! My baby has committed no fault. Oh! &s;pare me for the &s;ake of my unborn offspring, whom, ere it ta&s;tes life, your &s;everity dooms to de&s;truc|tion!"</P>
<P>The priore&s;s drew back ha&s;tily; &s;he forced her habit from my gra&s;p, as if my touch had been contagious.</P>
<P>"What!" &s;he exclaimed with an exa&s;|perated air: "What! Dare you plead for the produce of your &s;hame? Shall a crea|ture be permitted to live, conceived in guilt &s;o mon&s;trous? Abandoned woman, &s;peak for him no more! Better that the wretch &s;hould peri&s;h than live: begotten in perjury, incontinence, and pollution, it cannot fail to prove a prodigy of vice. Hear me, thou guilty! Expect no mercy from me, either for your&s;elf or brat. Ra|ther pray that death may &s;eize you before you produce it; or, if it mu&s;t &s;ee the light, that its eyes may immediately be clo&s;ed

again for ever! No aid &s;hall be given you in your labour; bring your offspring into the world your&s;elf, feed it your&s;elf, nur&s;e it your&s;elf, bury it your&s;elf: God grant that the latter may happen &s;oon, le&s;t you receive comfort from the fruit of your ini|quity!"</P>
<P>This inhuman &s;peech, the threats which it contained, the dreadful &s;ufferings foretold to me by the domina, and her prayers for my infant's death, on whom, though un|born, I already doted, were more than my exhau&s;ted frame could &s;upport. Uttering a deep groan, I fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the feet of my unrelenting enemy. I know not how long I remained in this &s;ituation; but I imagine that &s;ome time mu&s;t have elap&s;ed before my recovery, &s;ince it &s;ufficed the priore&s;s and her nuns to quit the cavern. When my &s;en&s;es returned, I found my&s;elf in &s;ilence and &s;olitude. I heard not even the retiring foot-&s;teps of my per&s;ecutors. All was hu&s;hed, and all was dreadful! I had been thrown upon the bed of &s;traw:
<PB N="253" REF="254">
The heavy chain which I had already eyed with terror, was wound around my wai&s;t, and fa&s;tened me to the wall. A lamp glimmering with dull melancholy rays through my dungeon, permitted my di&s;tin|gui&s;hing all its horrors. It was &s;eparated from the cavern by a low and irregular wall of &s;tone. A large cha&s;m was left open in it, which formed the entrance, for door there was none. A leaden crucifix was in front of my &s;traw couch. A tattered rug lay near me, as did al&s;o a chaplet of beads; and not far from me &s;tood a pitcher of water, and a wicker-ba&s;ket containing a &s;mall loaf, and a bottle of oil to &s;upply my lamp.</P>
<P>With a de&s;pondent eye did I examine this &s;cene of &s;uffering: when I reflected that I was doomed to pa&s;s in it the remainder of my days, my heart was rent with bitter angui&s;h. I had once been taught to look forward to a lot &s;o different! At one time my pro&s;pects had appeared &s;o bright, &s;o flattering! Now all was lo&s;t to me. Friends,
<PB N="254" REF="255">
comfort, &s;ociety, happine&s;s, in one moment I was deprived of all! Dead to the world, dead to plea&s;ure, I lived to nothing but the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery. How fair did that world &s;eem to me, from which I was for ever excluded! How many loved objects did it contain, whom I never &s;hould behold again! As I threw a look of terror round my pri&s;on, as I &s;hrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my &s;ubterraneous dwelling, the change &s;eemed &s;o &s;triking, &s;o abrupt, that I doubted its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the de|&s;tined bride of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the noble&s;t families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould in one moment become a captive, &s;eparated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to &s;upport life with the coar&s;e&s;t aliments&mdash;appeared a change &s;o &s;udden and incredible, that I be|lieved my&s;elf the &s;port of &s;ome frightful vi&s;ion. Its continuance convinced me of
<PB N="255" REF="256">
my mi&s;take with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for &s;ome relief from my &s;ufferings: every morning my hopes were di&s;appointed. At length I abandoned all idea of e&s;caping, I re&s;igned my&s;elf to my fate, and only expected li|berty when &s;he came the companion of death.</P>
<P>My mental angui&s;h, and the dreadful &s;cenes in which I had been an actre&s;s, ad|vanced the period of my labour. In &s;oli|tude and mi&s;ery, abandoned by all, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted by art, uncomforted by friend&s;hip, with pangs which if witne&s;&s;ed would have touched the harde&s;t heart, was I delivered of my wretched burthen. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to pre&s;erve its exi&s;tence. I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my bo&s;om, and offer up prayers for its &s;afe|ty. I was &s;oon deprived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attend|ance, my ignorance how to nur&s;e it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the un|whole&s;ome
<PB N="256" REF="257">
air which inflated its lungs, ter|minated my &s;weet babe's &s;hort and painful exi&s;tence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witne&s;&s;ed its death with ago|nies which beggar all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But my grief was unavailing. My in|fant was no more; nor could all my &s;ighs impart to its little tender frame the breath of a moment. I rent my winding-&s;heet, and wrapped in it my lovely child. I placed it on my bo&s;om, its &s;oft arm folded round my neck, and its pale cold cheek re&s;ting upon mine. Thus did its lifele&s;s limbs re|po&s;e, while I covered it with ki&s;&s;es, talked to it, wept, and moaned over it without re|mi&s;&s;ion day or night. Camilla entered my pri&s;on regularly once every twenty-four hours to bring me food. In &s;pite of her flinty nature, &s;he could not behold this &s;pectacle unmoved. She feared that grief &s;o exce&s;&s;ive would at length turn my brain; and in truth I was not always in my pro|per &s;en&s;es. From a principle of compa&s;&s;ion &s;he urged me to permit the cor&s;e to be bu|ried;
<PB N="257" REF="258">
but to this I never would con&s;ent. I vowed, not to part with it while I had life: its pre&s;ence was my only comfort, and no per&s;ua&s;ion could induce me to give it up. It &s;oon became a ma&s;s of putridity, and to every eye was a loath&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting object, to every eye but a mother's. In vain did human feelings bid me recoil from this emblem of mortality with repugnance. I with&s;tood, and vanqui&s;hed that repug|nance. I per&s;i&s;ted in holding my infant to my bo&s;om, in lamenting it, loving it, adoring it! Hour after hour have I pa&s;&s;ed upon my &s;orry couch, contemplating what had once been my child. I endeavoured to retrace its features through the livid cor|ruption with which they were over&s;pread. During my confinement, this &s;ad occupa|tion was my only delight; and at that time worlds &s;hould not have bribed me to give it up. Even when relea&s;ed from my pri&s;on, I brought away my child in my arms. The repre&s;entations of my two kind friends&mdash;[Here &s;he took the hands
<PB N="258" REF="259">
of the marchione&s;s and Virginia, and pre&s;&s;|ed them alternately to her lips]&mdash;at length per&s;uaded me to re&s;ign my unhappy infant to the grave. Yet I parted from it with reluctance. However, rea&s;on at length prevailed; I &s;uffered it to be taken from me, and it now repo&s;es in con&s;ecrated ground.</P>
<P>I before mentioned, that regularly once a day Camilla brought me food. She &s;ought not to embitter my &s;orrows with re|proach. She bade me, 'tis true, re&s;ign all hopes of liberty and worldly happine&s;s; but &s;he encouraged me to bear with pa|tience my temporary di&s;tre&s;s, and advi&s;ed me to draw comfort from religion. My &s;ituation evidently affected her more than &s;he ventured to expre&s;s; but &s;he believed that to extenuate my fault would make me le&s;s anxious to repent it. Often while her lips painted the enormity of my guilt in glaring colours, her eyes betrayed how &s;en|&s;ible &s;he was to my &s;ufferings. In fact, I am certain that none of my tormentors (for the
<PB N="259" REF="260">
three other nuns entered my pri&s;on occa&s;ion|ally) were &s;o much actuated by the &s;pirit of oppre&s;&s;ive cruelty, as by the idea that to af|flict my body was the only way to pre&s;erve my &s;oul. Nay, even this per&s;ua&s;ion might not have had &s;uch weight with them, and they might have thought my puni&s;hment too &s;evere, had not their good di&s;po&s;itions been repre&s;&s;ed by blind obedience to their &s;upe|rior. Her re&s;entment exi&s;ted in full force. My project of elopement having been di&s;|covered by the abbot of the Capuchins, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf lowered in his opinion by my di&s;grace, and in con&s;equence her hate was inveterate. She told the nuns, to who&s;e cu&s;tody I was committed, that my fault was of the mo&s;t heinous nature, that no &s;ufferings could equal the offence, and that nothing could &s;ave me from eternal perdition but puni&s;hing my guilt with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. The &s;uperior's word is an oracle to but too many of a convent's inha|bitants. The nuns believed whatever the priore&s;s cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ert: though contradicted
<PB N="260" REF="261">
by rea&s;on and charity, they he&s;itated not to admit the truth of her arguments. They followed her injunctions to the very letter, and were fully per&s;uaded, that to treat me with lenity, or to &s;hew the lea&s;t pity for my woes, would be a direct means to de|&s;troy my chance for &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Camilla being mo&s;t employed about me, was particularly charged by the priore&s;s to treat me with har&s;hne&s;s. In compliance with the&s;e orders, &s;he frequently &s;trove to convince me how ju&s;t was my puni&s;hment, and how enormous was my crime. She bade me think my&s;elf too happy in &s;aving my &s;oul by mortifying my body, and even threatened me &s;ometimes with eternal per|dition. Yet, as I before ob&s;erved, &s;he al|ways concluded by words of encourage|ment and comfort; and though uttered by Camilla's lips, I ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed the do|mina's expre&s;&s;ions. Once, and once only, the priore&s;s vi&s;ited me in my dungeon. She then treated me with the mo&s;t unrelenting cruelty. She loaded me with reproaches,
<PB N="261" REF="262">
taunted me with my frailty; and, when I implored her mercy, told me to a&s;k it of Heaven, &s;ince I de&s;erved none on earth. She even gazed upon my lifele&s;s infant without emotion; and when &s;he left me, I heard her charge Camilla to increa&s;e the hard&s;hips of my captivity. Unfeeling wo|man! But let me check my re&s;entment. She has expiated her errors by her &s;ad and unexpected death. Peace be with her! and may her crimes be forgiven in heaven, as I forgive her my &s;ufferings on earth!</P>
<P>Thus did I drag on a mi&s;erable exi&s;t|ence. Far from growing familiar with my pri&s;on, I beheld it every moment with new horror. The cold &s;eemed more pierc|ing and bitter, the air more thick and pe&s;|tilential. My frame became weak, feveri&s;h, and emaciated. I was unable to ri&s;e from the bed of &s;traw, and exerci&s;e my limbs in the narrow limits to which the length of my chain permitted me to move. Though exhau&s;ted, faint, and weary, I trembled to profit by the approach of &s;leep. My &s;lum|bers
<PB N="262" REF="263">
were con&s;tantly interrupted by &s;ome obnoxious in&s;ect crawling over me. Some|times I felt the bloated toad, hideous and pampered with the poi&s;onous vapours of the dungeon, dragging his loath&s;ome length along my bo&s;om. Sometimes the quick cold lizard rou&s;ed me, leaving his &s;limy track upon my face, and entangling it&s;elf in the tre&s;&s;es of my wild and matted hair. Often have I at waking found my fingers ringed with the long worms which bred in the corrupted fle&s;h of my infant. At &s;uch times I &s;hrieked with terror and di&s;gu&s;t; and, while I &s;hook off the reptile, trembled with all a woman's weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was my &s;ituation when Camilla was &s;uddenly taken ill. A dangerous fever, &s;uppo&s;ed to be infectious, confined her to her bed. Every one, except the lay &s;i&s;ter appointed to nur&s;e her, avoided her with caution, and feared to catch the di&s;ea&s;e. She was perfectly delirious, and by no means capable of attending to me. The domina, and the nuns admitted to the my&s;|tery,
<PB N="263" REF="264">
had latterly entirely given me over to Camilla's care. In con&s;equence, they bu&s;ied them&s;elves no more about me; and, occupied by preparing for the approaching fe&s;tival, it is more than probable that I never once entered into their thoughts. Of the rea&s;on of Camilla's negligence I have been informed &s;ince my relea&s;e by the Mother St. Ur&s;ula. At that time I was very far from &s;u&s;pecting its cau&s;e. On the contrary, I waited for my gaoler's appear|ance at fir&s;t with impatience, and after|wards with de&s;pair. One day pa&s;&s;ed away: another followed it: the third arrived. Still no Camilla! &s;till no food! I knew the lap&s;e of time by the wa&s;ting of my lamp, to &s;upply which, fortunately a week's &s;up|ply of oil had been left me. I &s;uppo&s;ed, either that the nuns had forgotten me, or that the domina had ordered them to let me peri&s;h. The latter idea &s;eemed the mo&s;t probable: yet &s;o natural is the love of life, that I trembled to find it true. Though embittered by every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, my
<PB N="264" REF="265">
exi&s;tence was &s;till dear to me, and I dreaded to lo&s;e it. Every &s;ucceeding minute proved to me that I mu&s;t abandon all hopes of relief. I was become an ab&s;olute &s;kele|ton: my eyes already failed me, and my limbs were beginning to &s;tiffen. I could only expre&s;s my angui&s;h, and the pangs of that hunger which gnawed my heart|&s;trings, by frequent groans, who&s;e melan|choly &s;ound the vaulted roof of the dungeon re-echoed. I re&s;igned my&s;elf to my fate: I already expected the moment of di&s;&s;olu|tion, when my guardian angel&mdash;when my beloved brother arrived in time to &s;ave me. My &s;ight, grown dim and feeble, at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to recognize him: and when I did di&s;tingui&s;h his features, the &s;udden bur&s;t of rapture was too much for me to bear.

to the family of Villa-Franca. But what you cannot know, is the extent of my gratitude, boundle&s;s as the excellence of my benefactors. Lorenzo! Raymond! names &s;o dear to me! teach me to bear with fortitude this &s;udden tran&s;ition from mi&s;ery to bli&s;s. So lately a captive, op|pre&s;&s;ed with chains, peri&s;hing with hunger, &s;uffering every inconvenience of cold and want, hidden from the light, excluded from &s;ociety, hopele&s;s, neglected, and, as I feared, forgotten: now re&s;tored to life and liberty, enjoying all the comforts of affluence and ea&s;e, &s;urrounded by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t loved by me, and on the point of becoming his bride who has long been wedded to my heart, my happine&s;s is &s;o exqui&s;ite, &s;o perfect, that &s;carcely can my brain &s;u&s;tain the weight. One only wi&s;h remains ungratified. It is to &s;ee my brother in his former health, and to know that Antonia's memory is buried in her grave. Granted this prayer, I have no|thing more to de&s;ire. I tru&s;t that my pa&s;t
<PB N="266" REF="267">
&s;ufferings have purcha&s;ed from Heaven the pardon of my momentary weakne&s;s. That I have offended, offended greatly and grievou&s;ly, I am fully con&s;cious. But let not my hu&s;band, becau&s;e he once con|quered my virtue, doubt the propriety of my future conduct. I have been frail and full of error: but I yielded not to the warmth of con&s;titution. Raymond, affec|tion for you betrayed me. I was too confi|dent of my &s;trength: but I depended no le&s;s on your honour than my own. I had vowed never to &s;ee you more. Had it not been for the con&s;equences of that unguard|ed moment, my re&s;olution had been kept. Fate willed it otherwi&s;e, and I cannot but rejoice at its decree. Still my conduct has been highly blameable; and while I at|tempt to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, I blu&s;h at recol|lecting my imprudence. Let me then di&s;|mi&s;s the ungrateful &s;ubject; fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring you, Raymond, that you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to repent our union, and that, the more culpable have been the errors of your

<P>Here Agnes cea&s;ed; and the marquis replied to her addre&s;s in terms equally &s;in|cere and affectionate. Lorenzo expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at the pro&s;pect of being &s;o clo&s;ely connected with a man for whom he had ever entertained the highe&s;t e&s;teem. The Pope's bull had fully and effectually relea&s;ed Agnes from her religious engage|ments. The marriage was therefore cele|brated as &s;oon as the needful preparations had been made: for the marquis wi&s;hed to have the ceremony performed with all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;plendour and publicity. This being over, and the bride having received the compliments of Madrid, &s;he departed with Don Raymond for his ca&s;tle in Andalu&s;ia. Lorenzo accompanied them, as did al&s;o the marchione&s;s de Villa-Franca and her lovely daughter. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that
<PB N="268" REF="269">
Theodore was of the party, and would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe his joy at his ma&s;ter's marriage. Previous to his departure the marquis, to atone in &s;ome mea&s;ure for his pa&s;t neglect, made &s;ome enquiries relative to Elvira. Finding that &s;he, as well as her daughter, had received many &s;ervices from Leonella and Jacintha, he &s;hewed his re|&s;pect to the memory of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law by making the two women hand&s;ome pre&s;ents. Lorenzo followed his example. Leonella was highly flattered by the attentions of noblemen &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, and Jacintha ble&s;&s;ed the hour on which her hou&s;e was bewitched.</P>
<P>On her &s;ide, Agnes failed not to reward her convent friends. The worthy Mother St. Ur&s;ula, to whom &s;he owed her liberty, was named, at her reque&s;t, &s;uperintendant of "the Ladies of Charity." This was one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t opulent &s;ocieties throughout Spain. Bertha and Cornelia, not choo&s;ing to quit their friend, were ap|pointed to principal charges in the &s;ame

e&s;tabli&s;hment. As to the nuns who had aided the domina in per&s;ecuting Agnes; Camilla, being confined by illne&s;s to her bed, had peri&s;hed in the flames which con|&s;umed St. Clare's convent. Mariana, Alix, and Violante, as well as two more, had fallen victims to the popular rage. The three others who had in council &s;upported the domina's &s;entence, were &s;everely repri|manded, and bani&s;hed to religious hou&s;es in ob&s;cure and di&s;tant provinces. Here they langui&s;hed away a few years, a&s;hamed of their former weakne&s;s, and &s;hunned by their companions with aver&s;ion and con|tempt.</P>
<P>Nor was the fidelity of Flora permitted to go unrewarded. Her wi&s;hes being con|&s;ulted, &s;he declared her&s;elf impatient to revi&s;it her native land.

and Virginia were eternally together. The more he &s;aw of her, the more was he convinced of her merit. On her part, &s;he laid her&s;elf out to plea&s;e; and not to &s;uc|ceed was for her impo&s;&s;ible. Lorenzo witne&s;&s;ed with admiration her beautiful per&s;on, elegant manners, innumerable ta|lents, and &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition. He was al&s;o much flattered by her prejudice in his fa|vour, which &s;he had not &s;ufficient art to conceal. However, his &s;entiments partook not of that ardent character which had marked his affection for Antonia. The image of that lovely and unfortunate girl &s;till lived in his heart, and baffled all Vir|ginia's efforts to di&s;place it. Still, when the duke propo&s;ed to him the match, which he wi&s;hed &s;o earne&s;tly to take place, his ne|phew did not reject the offer. The urgent &s;upplications of his friends, and the lady's merit, conquered his repugnance to enter|ing into new engagements. He propo&s;ed him&s;elf to the marquis de Villa-Franca, and was accepted with joy and gratitude. Virginia became his wife, nor did &s;he ever
<PB N="271" REF="272">
give him cau&s;e to repent his choice. His e&s;teem increa&s;ed for her daily. Her un|remitted endeavours to plea&s;e him could not but &s;ucceed. His affection a&s;&s;umed &s;tronger and warmer colours. Antonia's image was gradually effaced from his bo|&s;om, and Virginia became &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of that heart, which &s;he well de&s;erved to po&s;|&s;e&s;s without a partner.</P>
<P>The remaining years of Raymond and Agnes, of Lorenzo and Virginia, were happy as can be tho&s;e allotted to mortals, born to be the prey of grief, and &s;port of di&s;appointment. The exqui&s;ite &s;orrows with which they had been afflicted, made them think lightly of every &s;ucceeding woe. They had felt the &s;harpe&s;t darts in misfortune's quiver. Tho&s;e which remain|ed, appeared blunt in compari&s;on. Hav|ing weathered fate's heavie&s;t &s;torms, they looked calmly upon its terrors: or, if ever they felt affliction's ca&s;ual gales, they &s;eemed to them gentle as zephyrs which breathe over &s;ummer-&s;eas.</P>

<P>ON the day following Antonia's death, all Madrid was a &s;cene of con&s;ternation and amazement. An archer who had wit|ne&s;&s;ed the adventure in the &s;epulchre, had indi&s;creetly related the circum&s;tances of the murder: he had al&s;o named the perpetra|tor. The confu&s;ion was without example, which this intelligence rai&s;ed among the devotees. Mo&s;t of them di&s;believed it, and went them&s;elves to the abbey to a&s;cer|tain the fact. Anxious to avoid the &s;hame to which their &s;uperior's ill conduct expo&s;ed the whole brotherhood, the monks a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="273" REF="274">
the vi&s;itors, that Ambro&s;io was prevented from receiving them as u&s;ual by nothing but illne&s;s. This attempt was un&s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;ame excu&s;e being repeated day after day, the archer's &s;tory gradually obtained confidence. His parti&s;ans abandoned him: no one entertained a doubt of his guilt: and they who before had been the warme&s;t in his prai&s;e, were now the mo&s;t vociferous in his condemnation.</P>
<P>While his innocence or guilt was debated in Madrid with the utmo&s;t acrimony, Am|bro&s;io was a prey to the pangs of con&s;cious villany, and the terrors of puni&s;hment impending over him. When he looked back to the eminence on which he had lately &s;tood, univer&s;ally honoured and re|&s;pected, at peace with the world and with him&s;elf, &s;carcely could he believe that he was indeed the culprit, who&s;e crimes and who&s;e fate he trembled to con&s;ider. But a few weeks had elap&s;ed, &s;ince he was pure and virtuous, courted by the wi&s;e&s;t and noble&s;t in Madrid, and regarded by the
<PB N="274" REF="275">
people with a reverence that approached idolatry. He now &s;aw him&s;elf &s;tained with the mo&s;t loathed and mon&s;trous &s;ins, the object of univer&s;al execration, a pri&s;oner of the Holy Office, and probably doomed to peri&s;h in tortures the mo&s;t &s;evere. He could not hope to deceive his judges: the proofs of his guilt were too &s;trong. His being in the &s;epulchre at &s;o late an hour, his confu&s;ion at the di&s;covery, the dagger which in his fir&s;t alarm he owned had been concealed by him, and the blood which had &s;pirted upon his habit from Antonia's wound, &s;ufficiently marked him out for the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. He waited with agony for the day of examination. He had no re&s;ource to comfort him in his di&s;tre&s;s. Religion could not in&s;pire him with fortitude. If he read the books of morality which were put into his hands, he &s;aw in them nothing but the enormity of his offences. If he attempted to pray, he recollected that he de&s;erved not Heaven's protection, and believed his crimes &s;o mon&s;trous as to exceed even God's
<PB N="275" REF="276">
infinite goodne&s;s. For every other &s;inner he thought there might be hope, but for him there could be none. Shuddering at the pa&s;t, angui&s;hed by the pre&s;ent, and dreading the future, thus pa&s;&s;ed he the few days preceding that which was marked for his trial.</P>
<P>That day arrived. At nine in the morn|ing his pri&s;on-door was unlocked; and his gaoler entering, commanded him to follow him. He obeyed with trembling. He was conducted into a &s;pacious hall hung with black cloth. At the table &s;at three grave &s;tern-looking men, al&s;o habited in black: one was the Grand Inqui&s;itor, whom the importance of this cau&s;e had induced to examine into it him&s;elf. At a &s;maller table at a little di&s;tance &s;at the &s;ecretary, provided with all nece&s;&s;ary implements for writing. Ambro&s;io was beckoned to ad|vance, and take his &s;tation at the lower end of the table. As his eye glanced down|wards, he perceived various iron in&s;tru|ments lying &s;cattered upon the floor. Their
<PB N="276" REF="277">
forms were unknown to him, but appre|hen&s;ion immediately gue&s;&s;ed them to be engines of torture. He turned pale, and with difficulty prevented him&s;elf from &s;ink|ing upon the ground.</P>
<P>Profound &s;ilence prevailed, except when the inqui&s;itors whi&s;pered a few words among them&s;elves my&s;teriou&s;ly. Near an hour pa&s;&s;ed away, and with every &s;econd of it Ambro&s;io's fears grew more poignant. At length a &s;mall door, oppo&s;ite to that by which he had entered the hall, grated hea|vily upon its hinges. An officer appeared, and was immediately followed by the beau|tiful Matilda. Her hair hung about her face wildly: her cheeks were pale, and her eyes &s;unk and hollow. She threw a me|lancholy look upon Ambro&s;io: he replied by one of aver&s;ion and reproach. She was placed oppo&s;ite to him. A bell then &s;ounded thrice. It was the &s;ignal for opening the court; and the inqui&s;itors entered upon their office.</P>
<P>In the&s;e trials neither the accu&s;ation is
<PB N="277" REF="278">
mentioned, nor the name of the accu&s;er. The pri&s;oners are only a&s;ked, whether they will confe&s;s. If they reply, that, having no crime, they can make no confe&s;&s;ion, they are put to the torture without delay. This is re|peated at intervals, either till the &s;u&s;pected avow them&s;elves culpable, or the per&s;eve|rance of the examinants is worn out and exhau&s;ted: but without a direct acknow|ledgment of their guilt, the Inqui&s;ition never pronounces the final doom of its pri|&s;oners. In general much time is &s;uffered to elap&s;e without their being que&s;tioned; but Ambro&s;io's trial had been ha&s;tened on account of a &s;olemn Auto da F&eacute; which would take place in a few days, and in which the inqui&s;itors meant this di&s;tingui&s;h|ed culprit to perform a part, and give a &s;triking te&s;timony of their vigilance.</P>
<P>The abbot was not merely accu&s;ed of rape and murder; the crime of &s;orcery was laid to his charge, as well as to Matilda's. She had been &s;eized as an accomplice in Antonia's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. On &s;earching her
<PB N="278" REF="279">
cell, various &s;u&s;picious books and in&s;tru|ments were found, which ju&s;tified the accu|&s;ation brought again&s;t her. To criminate the monk, the con&s;tellated mirror was pro|duced, which Matilda had accidentally left in his chamber. The &s;trange figures en|graved upon it caught the attention of Don Ramirez, while &s;earching the abbot's cell; in con&s;equence, he carried it away with him. It was &s;hewn to the Grand In|qui&s;itor, who, having con&s;idered it for &s;ome time, took off a &s;mall golden cro&s;s which hung at his girdle, and laid it upon the mirror. In&s;tantly a loud noi&s;e was heard, re&s;embling a clap of thunder, and the &s;teel &s;hivered into a thou&s;and pieces. This cir|cum&s;tance confirmed the &s;u&s;picion of the monk's having dealt in magic. It was even &s;uppo&s;ed, that his former influence over the minds of the people was entirely to be a&s;cribed to witchcraft.</P>
<P>Determined to make him confe&s;s not only the crimes which he had committed, but tho&s;e al&s;o of which he was innocent,
<PB N="279" REF="280">
the inqui&s;itors began their examination. Though dreading the tortures as he dread|ed death, which would con&s;ign him to eter|nal torments, the abbot a&s;&s;erted his purity in a voice bold and re&s;olute. Matilda fol|lowed his example, but &s;poke with fear and trembling. Having in vain exhorted him to confe&s;s, the inqui&s;itors ordered the monk to be put to the que&s;tion. The decree was immediately executed. Ambro&s;io &s;uf|fered the mo&s;t excruciating pangs that ever were invented by human cruelty. Yet &s;o dreadful is death, when guilt accompanies it, that he had &s;ufficient fortitude to per&s;i&s;t in his di&s;avowal. His agonies were re|doubled in con&s;equence; nor was he re|lea&s;ed till, fainting from exce&s;s of pain, in|&s;en&s;ibility re&s;cued him from the hands of his tormentors.</P>
<P>Matilda was next ordered to the torture; but, terrified by the &s;ight of the friar's &s;uf|ferings, her courage totally de&s;erted her. She &s;ank upon her knees, acknowledged her corre&s;ponding with infernal &s;pirits, and
<PB N="280" REF="281">
that &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed the monk's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of Antonia; but as to the crime of &s;or|cery, &s;he declared her&s;elf the &s;ole criminal, and Ambro&s;io perfectly innocent. The latter a&s;&s;ertion met with no credit. The abbot had recovered his &s;en&s;es in time to hear the confe&s;&s;ion of his accomplice: but he was too much enfeebled by what he had already undergone, to be capable at that time of &s;u&s;taining new torments. He was commanded back to his cell, but fir&s;t informed, that as &s;oon as he had gained &s;trength &s;ufficient he mu&s;t prepare him&s;elf for a &s;econd examination. The inqui&s;itors hoped that he would then be le&s;s hardened and ob&s;tinate. To Matilda it was an|nounced, that &s;he mu&s;t expiate her crime in fire on the approaching Auto da F&eacute;. All her tears and entreaties could procure no mitigation of her doom, and &s;he was drag|ged by force from the hall of trial.</P>
<P>Returned to his dungeon, the &s;ufferings of Ambro&s;io's body were far more &s;upport|able than tho&s;e of his mind. His di&s;lo|cated
<PB N="281" REF="282">
limbs, the nails torn from his hands and feet, and his fingers ma&s;hed and broken by the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;crews, were far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in angui&s;h by the agitation of his &s;oul, and vehemence of his terrors. He &s;aw, that guilty or innocent his judges were bent upon condemning him. The remembrance of what his denial had already co&s;t him, terrified him at the idea of being again ap|plied to the que&s;tion, and almo&s;t engaged him to confe&s;s his crimes. Then again the con&s;equences of his confe&s;&s;ion fla&s;hed before him, and rendered him once more irre&s;olute. His death would be inevitable, and that a death the mo&s;t dreadful. He had li&s;tened to Matilda's doom, and doubt|ed not that a &s;imilar was re&s;erved for him. He &s;huddered at the approaching Auto da F&eacute;, at the idea of peri&s;hing in flames, and only e&s;caping from endurable torments to pa&s;s into others more &s;ubtile and everla&s;t|ing! With affright did he bend his mind's eye on the &s;pace beyond the grave; nor could hide from him&s;elf how ju&s;tly he
<PB N="282" REF="283">
ought to dread Heaven's vengeance. In this labyrinth of terrors, fain would he have taken his refuge in the gloom of athei&s;m; fain would he have denied the &s;oul's im|mortality; have per&s;uaded him&s;elf that, when his eyes once clo&s;ed, they would never more open, and that the &s;ame mo|ment would annihilate his &s;oul and body. Even this re&s;ource was refu&s;ed to him. To permit his being blind to the fallacy of this belief, his knowledge was too exten&s;ive, his under&s;tanding too &s;olid and ju&s;t. He could not help feeling the exi&s;tence of a God. Tho&s;e truths, once his comfort, now pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him in the cleare&s;t light; but they only &s;erved to drive him to di&s;traction. They de&s;troyed his ill-grounded hopes of e&s;caping puni&s;hment; and, di&s;pelled by the irre&s;i&s;tible brightne&s;s of truth and conviction, philo&s;ophy's de|ceitful vapours faded away like a dream.</P>
<P>In angui&s;h almo&s;t too great for mortal frame to bear, he expected the time when he was again to be examined. He bu&s;ied
<PB N="283" REF="284">
him&s;elf in planning ineffectual &s;chemes for e&s;caping both pre&s;ent and future puni&s;h|ment. Of the fir&s;t there was no po&s;&s;ibility; of the &s;econd de&s;pair made him neglect the only means. While Rea&s;on forced him to acknowledge a God's exi&s;tence, Con&s;cience made him doubt the infinity of his good|ne&s;s. He di&s;believed that a &s;inner like him could find mercy. He had not been deceived into error: ignorance could fur|ni&s;h him with no excu&s;e. He had &s;een vice in her true colours. Before he com|mitted his crimes, he had computed every &s;cruple of their weight, and yet he had committed them.</P>
<P>"Pardon?" he would cry in an acce&s;s of phren&s;y: "Oh! there can be none for me!"</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded of this, in&s;tead of humbling him&s;elf in penitence, of deploring his guilt, and employing his few remaining hours in deprecating Heaven's wrath, he abandoned him&s;elf to the tran&s;ports of de&s;perate rage; he &s;orrowed for the puni&s;hment of his
<PB N="284" REF="285">
crimes, not their commi&s;&s;ion; and exhaled his bo&s;om's angui&s;h in idle &s;ighs, in vain lamentations, in bla&s;phemy and de&s;pair. As the few beams of day which pierced through the bars of his pri&s;on-window gradually di&s;appeared, and their place was &s;upplied by the pale and glimmering lamp, he felt his terrors redouble, and his ideas be|come more gloomy, more &s;olemn, more de&s;pondent. He dreaded the approach of &s;leep. No &s;ooner did his eyes clo&s;e, wearied with tears and watching, than the dreadful vi&s;ions &s;eemed to be reali&s;ed on which his mind had dwelt during the day. He found him&s;elf in &s;ulphurous realms and burning caverns, &s;urrounded by fiends appointed his tormentors, and who drove him through a variety of tortures, each of which was more dreadful than the former. Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;mal &s;cenes wandered the gho&s;ts of Elvira and her daughter. They reproach|ed him with their deaths, recounted his crimes to the daemons, and urged them to inflict torments of cruelty yet more refined.
<PB N="285" REF="286">
Such were the pictures which floated before his eyes in &s;leep: they vani&s;hed not till his repo&s;e was di&s;turbed by exce&s;s of agony. Then would he &s;tart from the ground on which he had &s;tretched him&s;elf, his brows running down with cold &s;weat, his eyes wild and phren&s;ied; and he only exchanged the terrible certainty for &s;urmi&s;es &s;carcely more &s;upportable. He paced his dungeon with di&s;ordered &s;teps; he gazed with terror upon the &s;urrounding darkne&s;s, and often did he cry,</P>
<P>"Oh! fearful is night to the guilty!"</P>
<P>The day of his &s;econd examination was at hand. He had been compelled to &s;wal|low cordials, who&s;e virtues were calculated to re&s;tore his bodily &s;trength, and enable him to &s;upport the que&s;tion longer. On the night preceding this dreaded day, his fears for the morrow permitted him not to &s;leep. His terrors were &s;o violent as nearly to annihilate his mental powers. He &s;at like one &s;tupefied near the table on which his lamp was burning dimly. De&s;pair
<PB N="286" REF="287">
chained up his faculties in idioti&s;m, and he remained for &s;ome hours unable to &s;peak or move, or indeed to think.</P>
<P>"Look up, Ambro&s;io!" &s;aid a voice in accents well known to him.</P>
<P>The monk &s;tarted, and rai&s;ed his melan|choly eyes. Matilda &s;tood before him. She had quitted her religious habit. She now wore a female dre&s;s, at once elegant and &s;plendid; a profu&s;ion of diamonds blazed upon her robes, and her hair was confined by a coronet of ro&s;es. In her right hand the held a &s;mall book: a lively expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure beamed upon her countenance&mdash;but &s;till it was mingled with a wild imperious maje&s;ty, which in&s;pired the monk with awe, and repre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure his tran&s;ports at &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>"You here, Matilda?" he at length ex|claimed: "How have you gained entrance? Where are your chains? What means this magnificence, and the joy which &s;parkles in your eyes? Have our judges relented? Is there a chance of my e&s;caping? An&s;wer me
<PB N="287" REF="288">
for pity, and tell me what I have to hope or fear."</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io!" &s;he replied with an air of commanding dignity: "I have baffled the Inqui&s;ition's fury. I am free: a few mo|ments will place kingdoms between the&s;e dungeons and me; yet I purcha&s;e my li|berty at a dear, at a dreadful price! Dare you pay the &s;ame, Ambro&s;io? Dare you &s;pring without fear over the bounds which &s;eparate men from angels?&mdash;You are &s;ilent &mdash;You look upon me with eyes of &s;u&s;pi|cion and alarm&mdash;I read your thoughts, and confe&s;s their ju&s;tice. Yes, Ambro&s;io, I have &s;acrificed all for life and liberty. I am no longer a candidate for Heaven! I have renounced God's &s;ervice, and am en|li&s;ted beneath the banners of his foes. The deed is pa&s;t recall; yet, were it in my power to go back, I would not. Oh! my friend, to expire in &s;uch torments! to die amid&s;t cur&s;es and execrations! to bear the in&s;ults of an exa&s;perated mob! to be ex|po&s;ed to all the mortifications of &s;hame and

I have pre&s;erved a life, which otherwi&s;e I had lo&s;t in torture; and I have obtained the power of procuring every bli&s;s which can make that life delicious! The infernal &s;pi|rits obey me as their &s;overeign; by their aid &s;hall my days be pa&s;&s;ed in every re|finement of luxury and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. I will enjoy unre&s;trained the gratification of my &s;en&s;es; every pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall be in|dulged even to &s;atiety; then will I bid my &s;ervants invent new plea&s;ures, to revive and &s;timulate my glutted appetites! I go impa|tient to exerci&s;e my newly-gained domi|nion. I pant to be at liberty. Nothing &s;hould hold me one moment longer in this abhorred abode, but the hope of per&s;uad|ing you to follow my example.

<P>She pau&s;ed for the monk's reply: he &s;huddered while he gave it.</P>
<P>"Matilda!" he &s;aid, after a long &s;ilence, in a low and un&s;teady voice: "What price gave you for liberty?"</P>
<P>She an&s;wered him firm and dauntle&s;s.</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io, it was my &s;oul!"</P>
<P>"Wretched woman, what have you done! Pa&s;s but a few years, and how dread|ful will be your &s;ufferings!"</P>
<P>"Weak man, pa&s;s but this night, and how dreadful will be your own! Do you remember what you have already endured? To-morrow you mu&s;t bear torments doubly exqui&s;ite. Do you remember the horrors
<PB N="290" REF="291">
of a fiety puni&s;hment? In two days you mu&s;t be led a victim to the &s;take! What then will become of you? Still dare you hope for pardon? Still are you beguiled with vi&s;ions of &s;alvation? Think upon your crimes! Think upon your lu&s;t, your per|jury, inhumanity, and hypocri&s;y! Think upon the innocent blood which cries to the throne of God for vengeance! and then hope for mercy! Then dream of heaven, and &s;igh for worlds of light, and realms of peace and plea&s;ure! Ab&s;urd! Open your eyes, Ambro&s;io, and be prudent. Hell is your lot; you are doomed to eternal perdi|tion; nought lies beyond your grave, but a gulph of devouring flames. And will you then &s;peed towards that hell? Will you cla&s;p that perdition in your arms ere 'tis needful? Will you plunge into tho&s;e flames while you &s;till have the power to &s;hun them? 'Tis a madman's action.

<P>"Matilda, your coun&s;els are dangerous; I dare not, I will not follow them. I mu&s;t not give up my claim to &s;alvation. Mon|&s;trous are my crimes; but God is merciful, and I will not de&s;pair of pardon."</P>
<P>"Is &s;uch your re&s;olution? I have no more to &s;ay. I &s;peed to joy and liberty, and abandon you to death and eternal tor|ments!'</P>
<P>"Yet &s;tay one moment, Matilda! You command the infernal daemons; you can force open the&s;e pri&s;on doors; you can re|lea&s;e me from the&s;e chains which weigh me down. Save me, I conjure you, and bear me from the&s;e fearful abodes!"</P>
<P>"You a&s;k the only boon beyond my power to be&s;tow. I am forbidden to a&s;&s;i&s;t a churchman and a parti&s;an of God. Re|nounce tho&s;e titles, and command me."</P>

<P>She let the book fall upon the ground. A cloud of blue fire wrapped it&s;elf round her. She waved her hand to Ambro&s;io, and di&s;appeared. The momentary glare which the flames poured through the dun|geon, on di&s;&s;ipating &s;uddenly, &s;eemed to have increa&s;ed its natural gloom. The &s;olitary lamp &s;carcely gave light &s;ufficient to guide the monk to a chair. He threw him&s;elf into his &s;eat, folded his arms, and, leaning his head upon the table, &s;ank into reflections perplexing and unconnected.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">He was &s;till in this attitude, when the opening of the pri&s;on door rou&s;ed him from his &s;tupor. He was &s;ummoned to appear before the Grand Inqui&s;itor. He ro&s;e, and followed his gaoler with painful &s;teps. He was led into the &s;ame hall, placed before the &s;ame examiners, and was again interrogated whether he would con|fe&s;s. He replied as before, that, having no crimes, he could acknowledge none. But when the executioners prepared to put him to the que&s;tion, when he &s;aw the engines of torture, and remembered the pangs which they had already inflicted, his re&s;olution failed him entirely. Forgetting the con&s;e|quences, and only anxious to e&s;cape the ter|rors of the pre&s;ent moment, he made an am|ple confe&s;&s;ion. He di&s;clo&s;ed every circum|&s;tance of his guilt, and owned not merely the crimes with which he was charged, but tho&s;e of which he had never been &s;u&s;pected. Being interrogated as to Matilda's flight, which had created much confu&s;ion; he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had fold her&s;elf to Satan,
<PB N="294" REF="295">
and that &s;he was indebted to &s;orcery for her e&s;cape. He &s;till a&s;&s;ured his judges, that for his own part he had never entered into any compact with the infernal &s;pirits; but the threat of being tortured made him de|clare him&s;elf to be a &s;orcerer and heretic, and whatever other title the inqui&s;itors cho&s;e to fix upon him. In con&s;equence of this avowal, his &s;entence was immediately pro|nounced. He was ordered to prepare him|&s;elf to peri&s;h in the Auto da F&eacute;, which was to be &s;olemnized at twelve o'clock that night. This hour was cho&s;en, from the idea, that, the horror of the flames being heightened by the gloom of midnight, the execution would have a greater effect upon the mind of the people.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io, rather dead than alive, was left alone in his dungeon. The moment in which this terrible decree was pronounced, had nearly proved that of his di&s;&s;olution. He looked forward to the morrow with de&s;pair, and his terrors increa&s;ed with the approach of midnight. Sometimes he was
<PB N="295" REF="296">
buried in gloomy &s;ilence; at others, he raved with delirious pa&s;&s;ion, wrung his hands, and cur&s;ed the hour when he fir&s;t beheld the light. In one of the&s;e moments his eye re&s;ted upon Matilda's my&s;terious gift. His tran&s;ports of rage were in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended. He looked earne&s;tly at the book; he took it up, but immediately threw it from him with horror. He walked ra|pidly up and down his dungeon &mdash;then &s;top|ped, and again fixed his eyes on the &s;pot where the book had fallen. He reflected, that here at lea&s;t was a re&s;ource from the fate which he dreaded. He &s;tooped, and took it up a &s;econd time. He remained for &s;ome time trembling and irre&s;olute; he longed to try the charm, yet feared its con|&s;equences. The recollection of his &s;en|tence at length fixed his indeci&s;ion. He opened the volume; but his agitation was &s;o great, that he at fir&s;t &s;ought in vain for the page mentioned by Matilda. A&s;hamed of him&s;elf, he called all his courage to his aid. He turned to the &s;eventh leaf: he
<PB N="296" REF="297">
began to read it aloud; bat his eyes fre|quently wandered from the book, while he anxiou&s;ly ca&s;t them round in &s;earch of the &s;pirit, whom he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded to be|hold. Still he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign; and with a voice una&s;&s;ured, and frequent inter|ruptions, he contrived to fini&s;h the four fir&s;t lines of the page.</P>
<P>They were in a language who&s;e import was totally unknown to him. Scarce had he pronounced the la&s;t word, when the ef|fects of the charm were evident. A loud bur&s;t of thunder was heard, the pri&s;on &s;hook to its very foundations, a blaze of lightning fla&s;hed through the cell, and in the next moment, borne upon &s;ulphurous whirlwinds, Lucifer &s;tood before him a &s;e|cond time. But he came not as when at Matilda's &s;ummons he borrowed the &s;e|raph's form to deceive Ambro&s;io. He ap|peared in all that ugline&s;s which &s;ince his fall from heaven had been his portion. His bla&s;ted limbs &s;till bore marks of the Almighty's thunder. A &s;warthy darkne&s;s
<PB N="297" REF="298">
&s;pread it&s;elf over his gigantic form: his hands and feet were armed with long ta|lons. Fury glared in his eyes, which might have &s;truck the brave&s;t heart with terror. Over his huge &s;houlders waved two enormous &s;able wings: and his hair was &s;upplied by living &s;nakes, which twined them&s;elves round his brows with frightful hi&s;&s;ings. In one hand he held a roll of parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still the lightning fla&s;hed around him, and the thunder with repeated bur&s;ts &s;eemed to announce the di&s;&s;olution of Na|ture.</P>
<P>Terrified at an apparition &s;o different from what he had expected, Ambro&s;io remained gazing upon the fiend, deprived of the power of utterance. The thunder had cea&s;ed to roll: univer&s;al &s;ilence reigned through the dungeon.</P>
<P>"For what am I &s;ummoned hither?" &s;aid the daemon, in a voice which <HI>&s;ulphurous fogs had damped to hoar&s;ene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ound Nature &s;eemed to tremble.
<PB N="298" REF="299">
A violent earthquake rocked the ground, accompanied by a fre&s;h bur&s;t of thunder, louder and more appalling than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was long unable to an&s;wer the daemon's demand.</P>
<P>"I am condemned to die," he &s;aid with a faint voice, his blood running cold while he gazed upon his dreadful vi&s;itor. "Save me! bear me from hence!"</P>
<P>"Shall the reward of my &s;ervices be paid me? Dare you embrace my cau&s;e? Will you be mine, body and &s;oul? Are you prepared to renounce him who made you, and him who died for you? An&s;wer but 'Yes!' and Lucifer is your &s;lave."</P>
<P>"Will no le&s;s price content you? Can nothing &s;atisfy you but my eternal ruin? Spirit, you a&s;k too much. Yet convey me from this dungeon. Be my &s;ervant for one hour, and I will be yours for a thou&s;and years. Will not this offer &s;uffice?"</P>
<P>"It will not. I mu&s;t have your &s;oul: mu&s;t have it mine, and mine for ever."</P>
<P>"In&s;atiate daemon! I will not doom
<PB N="299" REF="300">
my&s;elf to endle&s;s torments. I will not give up my hopes of being one day pardoned."</P>
<P>"You will not? On what chimaera re&s;t then your hopes? Short-&s;ighted mortal! Mi&s;erable wretch! Are you not guilty? Are you not infamous in the eyes of men and angels? Can &s;uch enormous &s;ins be forgiven? Hope you to e&s;cape my power? Your fate is already pronounced. The Eternal has abandoned you. Mine you are marked in the book of de&s;tiny, and mine you mu&s;t and &s;hall be."</P>
<P>"Fiend! 'tis fal&s;e. Infinite is the Al|mighty's mercy, and the penitent &s;hall meet his forgivene&s;s. My crimes are mon|&s;trous, but I will not de&s;pair of pardon. Haply, when they have received due cha&s;|ti&s;ement &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Cha&s;ti&s;ement? Was purgatory meant for guilt like yours? Hope you, that your offences &s;hall be bought off by prayers of &s;uper&s;titious dotards and droning monks? Ambro&s;io! be wi&s;e. Mine you mu&s;t be. You are doomed to flames, but may &s;hun

Indulge in every plea&s;ure to which appetite may lead you. But from the moment that it quits your body, remember that your &s;oul belongs to me, and that I will not be defrauded of my right."</P>
<P>The monk was &s;ilent: but his looks de|clared that the tempter's words were not thrown away. He reflected on the condi|tions propo&s;ed with horror. On the other hand, he believed him&s;elf doomed to per|dition, and that, by refu&s;ing the daemon's &s;uccour, he only ha&s;tened tortures which he never could e&s;cape. The fiend &s;aw that his re&s;olution was &s;haken. He renewed his in&s;tances, and endeavoured to fix the abbot's indeci&s;ion. He de&s;cribed the ago|nies of death in the mo&s;t terrific colours; and he worked &s;o powerfully upon Am|bro&s;io's de&s;pair and fears, that he prevailed upon him to receive the parchment. He
<PB N="301" REF="302">
then &s;truck the iron pen which he held into a vein of the monk's left hand. It pierced deep, and was in&s;tantly filled with blood: yet Ambro&s;io felt no pain from the wound. The pen was put into his hand: it trem|bled. The wretch placed the parchment on the table before him, and prepared to &s;ign it. Suddenly he held his hand: he &s;tarted away ha&s;tily, and threw the pen upon the table.</P>
<P>"What am I doing?" he cried. Then turning to the fiend with a de&s;perate air, "Leave me! begone! I will not &s;ign the parchment."</P>
<P>"Fool!" exclaimed the di&s;appointed daemon, darting looks &s;o furious as pene|trated the friar's &s;oul with horror. "Thus am I trifled with? Go then! Rave in ago|ny, expire in tortures, and then learn the extent of the Eternal's mercy! But beware how you make me again your mock! Call me no more, till re&s;olved to accept my of|fers. Summon me a &s;econd time to di&s;mi&s;s me thus idly, and the&s;e talons &s;hall rend
<PB N="302" REF="303">
you into a thou&s;and pieces. Speak yet again: will you &s;ign the parchment?"</P>
<P>"I will not. Leave me. Away!"</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the thunder was heard to roll horribly: once more the earth trembled with violence: the dungeon re&s;ounded with loud &s;hrieks, and the daemon fled with bla&s;phemy and cur&s;es.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, the monk rejoiced at having re&s;i&s;ted the &s;educer's arts, and obtained a triumph over mankind's enemy: but as the hour of puni&s;hment drew near, his for|mer terrors revived in his heart. Their momentary repo&s;e &s;eemed to have given them fre&s;h vigour. The nearer that the time approached, the more did he dread appearing before the throne of God. He &s;huddered to think how &s;oon he mu&s;t be plunged into eternity&mdash;how &s;oon meet the eyes of his Creator, whom he had &s;o griev|ou&s;ly offended. The bell announced mid|night. It was the &s;ignal for being led to the &s;take. As he li&s;tened to the fir&s;t &s;troke, the blood cea&s;ed to circulate in the abbot's
<PB N="303" REF="304">
veins. He heard death and torture mur|mured in each &s;ucceeding &s;ound. He ex|pected to &s;ee the archers entering his pri|&s;on; and as the bell forbore to toll, he &s;eized the magic volume in a fit of de|&s;pair. He opened it, turned ha&s;tily to the &s;eventh page, and, as if fearing to allow him&s;elf a moment's thought, ran over the fatal lines with rapidity. Accompanied by his former terrors, Lucifer again &s;tood be|fore the trembler.</P>
<P>"You have &s;ummoned me," &s;aid the fiend. "Are you determined to be wi&s;e? Will you accept my conditions? You know them already. Renounce your claim to &s;alvation, make over to me your &s;oul, and I bear you from this dungeon in&s;tantly. Yet is it time. Re&s;olve, or it will be too late. Will you &s;ign the parchment?"</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t&mdash;Fate urges me&mdash;I accept your conditions."</P>
<P>"Sign the parchment," replied the dae|mon in an exulting tone.</P>
<P>The contract and the bloody pen &s;till lay
<PB N="304" REF="305">
upon the table. Ambro&s;io drew near it. He prepared to &s;ign his name. A mo|ment's reflection made him he&s;itate.</P>
<P>"Hark!" cried the tempter: "they come. Be quick. Sign the parchment, and I bear you from hence this moment."</P>
<P>In effect, the archers were heard ap|proaching, appointed to lead Ambro&s;io to the &s;take. The &s;ound encouraged the monk in his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"What is the import of this writing?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"It makes your &s;oul over to me for ever, and without re&s;erve."</P>
<P>"What am I to receive in exchange?"</P>
<P>"My protection, and relea&s;e from this dungeon. Sign it, and this in&s;tant I bear you away."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io took up the pen. He &s;et it to the parchment. Again his courage failed him. He felt a pang of terror at his heart, and once more threw the pen upon the table.</P>
<P>"Weak and puerile!" cried the exa&s;pe|rated
<PB N="305" REF="306">
fiend. "Away with this folly! Sign the writing this in&s;tant, or I &s;acrifice you to my rage."</P>
<P>At this moment the bolt of the outward door was drawn back. The pri&s;oner heard the rattling of chains: the heavy bar fell: the archers were on the point of entering. Worked up to phren&s;y by the urgent dan|ger, &s;hrinking from the approach of death, terrified by the daemon's threats, and &s;eeing no other means to e&s;cape de&s;truction, the wretched monk complied. He &s;igned the fatal contract, and gave it ha&s;tily into the evil &s;pirit's hands, who&s;e eyes, as he re|ceived the gift, glared with malicious rap|ture.</P>
<P>"Take it!" &s;aid the God-abandoned. "Now then &s;ave me! Snatch me from hence!"</P>
<P>"Hold! Do you freely and ab&s;olutely renounce your Creator and his Son?"</P>
<P>"I do! I do!"</P>
<P>"Do you make over your &s;oul to me for ever?"</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="307">"For ever!"</P>
<P>"Without re&s;erve or &s;ubterfuge? with|out future appeal to the divine mercy?"</P>
<P>The la&s;t chain fell from the door of the pri&s;on. The key was heard turning in the lock. Already the iron door grated heavily upon its ru&s;ty hinges&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am yours for ever, and irrevocably!" cried the monk wild with terror: "I aban|don all claim to &s;alvation. I own no power but yours. Hark! hark! they come! Oh! &s;ave me! bear me away!"</P>
<P>"I have triumphed! You are mine pa&s;t reprieve, and I fulfil my promi&s;e."</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, the door unclo&s;ed. In|&s;tantly the daemon gra&s;ped one of Ambro|&s;io's arms, &s;pread his broad pinions, and &s;prang with him into the air. The roof opened as they &s;oared upwards, and clo&s;ed again when they had quitted the dungeon.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the gaoler was thrown into the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e by the di&s;appear|ance of his pri&s;oner. Though neither he nor the archers were in time to witne&s;s the
<PB N="307" REF="308">
monk's e&s;cape, a &s;ulphurous &s;mell pre|vailing through the pri&s;on &s;ufficiently in|formed them by who&s;e aid he had been liberated. They ha&s;tened to make their report to the Grand Inqui&s;itor. The &s;tory, how a &s;orcerer had been carried away by the Devil, was &s;oon noi&s;ed about Madrid; and for &s;ome days the whole city was em|ployed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject. Gradu|ally it cea&s;ed to be the topic of conver&s;a|tion. Other adventures aro&s;e who&s;e no|velty engaged univer&s;al attention: and Ambro&s;io was &s;oon forgotten as totally as if he never had exi&s;ted. While this was pa&s;&s;ing, the monk, &s;upported by his infer|nal guide, traver&s;ed the air with the rapi|dity of an arrow; and a few moments placed him upon a precipice's brink, the &s;teepe&s;t in Sierra Morena.</P>
<P>Though re&s;cued from the Inqui&s;ition, Ambro&s;io as yet was in&s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;|&s;ings of liberty. The damning contract weighed heavy upon his mind; and the &s;cenes in which he had been a principal actor,
<PB N="308" REF="309">
had left behind them &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as rendered his heart the &s;eat of anarchy and confu&s;ion. The objects now before his eyes, and which the full moon &s;ailing through clouds permitted him to examine, were ill calculated to in&s;pire that calm, of which he &s;tood &s;o much in need. The di&s;order of his imagination was increa&s;ed by the wildne&s;s of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery; by the gloomy caverns and &s;teep rocks, ri&s;ing above each other, and dividing the pa&s;&s;ing clouds; &s;olitary clu&s;ters of trees &s;cattered here and there, among who&s;e thick-twined branches the wind of night &s;ighed hoar&s;ely and mournfully; the &s;hrill cry of mountain eagles, who had built their ne&s;ts among the&s;e lonely de&s;erts; the &s;tun|ning roar of torrents, as &s;welled by late rains they ru&s;hed violently down tremen|dous precipices; and the dark waters of a &s;ilent &s;luggi&s;h &s;tream, which faintly re|flected the moon-beams, and bathed the rock's ba&s;e on which Ambro&s;io &s;tood. The abbot ca&s;t round him a look of terror. His
<PB N="309" REF="310">
internal conductor was &s;till by his &s;ide, and eyed him with a look of mingled malice, exultation, and contempt.</P>
<P>"Whither have you brought me?" &s;aid the monk at length in an hollow trembling voice: "Why am I placed in this melan|choly &s;cene? Bear me from it quickly! Carry me to Matilda!"</P>
<P>The fiend replied not, but continued to gaze upon him in &s;ilence. Ambro&s;io could not &s;u&s;tain his glance; he turned away his eyes, while thus &s;poke the daemon:</P>
<P>"I have him then in my power! This model of piety! this being without re|proach! this mortal who placed his puny virtues on a level with tho&s;e of angels. He is mine! irrevocably, eternally mine! Companions of my &s;ufferings! denizens of hell! How grateful will be my pre&s;ent!"</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed; then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the monk&mdash;</P>
<P>"Carry you to Matilda?" he continued, repeating Ambro&s;io's words: "Wretch!
<PB N="310" REF="311">
you &s;hall &s;oon be with her! You well de|&s;erve a place near her, for hell boa&s;ts no mi&s;creant more guilty than your&s;elf. Hark, Ambro&s;io, while I unveil your crimes! You have &s;hed the blood of two inno|cents; Antonia and Elvira peri&s;hed by your hand. That Antonia whom you vi|olated, was your &s;i&s;ter! that Elvira whom you murdered, gave you birth! Tremble, abandoned hypocrite! inhuman parricide! ince&s;tuous ravi&s;her! tremble at the extent of your offences! And you it was who thought your&s;elf proof again&s;t temptation, ab&s;olved from human frailties, and free from error and vice! Is pride then a vir|tue? Is inhumanity no fault? Know, vain man! that I long have marked you for my prey: I watched the movements of your heart; I &s;aw that you were virtuous from vanity, not principle, and I &s;eized the fit moment of &s;eduction. I ob&s;erved your blind idolatry of the Madona's picture. I bade a &s;ubordinate but crafty &s;pirit a&s;&s;ume a &s;imilar form, and you eagerly yielded to

the blandi&s;hments of Matilda. Your pride was gratified by her flattery; your lu&s;t only needed an opportunity to break forth; you ran into the &s;nare blindly, and &s;crupled not to commit a crime, which you blamed in another with unfeeling &s;everity. It was I who threw Matilda in your way; it was I who gave you entrance to Antonia's cham|ber; it was I who cau&s;ed the dagger to be given you which pierced your &s;i&s;ter's bo|&s;om; and it was I who warned Elvira in dreams of your de&s;igns upon her daughter, and thus, by preventing your profiting by her &s;leep, compelled you to add rape as well as ince&s;t to the catalogue of your crimes. Hear, hear, Ambro&s;io! Had you re&s;i&s;ted me one minute longer, you had &s;aved your body and &s;oul. The guards whom you heard at your pri&s;on-door, came to &s;ignify your pardon. But I had already triumphed: my plots had already &s;uc|ceeded. Scarcely could I propo&s;e crimes &s;o quick as you performed them. You are mine, and Heaven it&s;elf cannot re&s;cue you

from my power. Hope not that your pe|nitence will make void our contract. Here is your bond &s;igned with your blood; you have given up your claim to mercy, and nothing can re&s;tore to you the rights which you have fooli&s;hly re&s;igned. Believe you, that your &s;ecret thoughts e&s;caped me? No, no, I read them all! You tru&s;ted that you &s;hould &s;till have time for repentance. I &s;aw your artifice, knew its fal&s;ity, and re|joiced in deceiving the deceiver! You are mine beyond reprieve: I burn to po&s;&s;e&s;s my right, and alive you quit not the&s;e moun|tains."</P>
<P>During the daemon's &s;peech, Ambro&s;io had been &s;tupefied by terror and &s;urpri&s;e. This la&s;t declaration rou&s;ed him.</P>
<P>"Not quit the&s;e mountains alive?" he exclaimed: "Perfidious, what mean you? Have you forgotten our contract?"</P>
<P>The fiend an&s;wered by a malicious laugh:</P>
<P>"Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promi&s;e than to
<PB N="313" REF="314">
&s;ave you from your pri&s;on? Have I not done &s;o? Are you not &s;afe from the Inqui|&s;ition&mdash;&s;afe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide your&s;elf to a devil! Why did you not &s;tipulate for life, and power, and plea&s;ure? Then all would have been granted: now, your reflections come too late. Mi&s;creant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!"</P>
<P>On hearing this &s;entence, dreadful were the feelings of the devoted wretch! He &s;ank upon his knees, and rai&s;ed his hands to|wards heaven. The fiend read his inten|tion, and prevented it&mdash;</P>
<P>"What?" he cried, darting at him a look of fury: "Dare you &s;till implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign peni|tence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, re&s;ign your hopes of pardon. Thus I &s;ecure my prey!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, darting his talons into the monk's &s;haven crown, he &s;prang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambro&s;io's &s;hrieks. The daemon

continued to &s;oar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, he relea&s;ed the &s;ufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy wa&s;te; the &s;harp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from precipice to pre|cipice, till, brui&s;ed and mangled, he re&s;ted on the river's banks. Life &s;till exi&s;ted in his mi&s;erable frame: he attempted in vain to rai&s;e him&s;elf; his broken and di&s;located limbs refu&s;ed to perform their office, nor was he able to quit the &s;pot where he had fir&s;t fallen. The &s;un now ro&s;e above the horizon; its &s;corching beams darted full upon the head of the expiring &s;inner. My|riads of infects were called forth by the warmth; they drank the blood which trickled from Ambro&s;io's wounds; he had no power to drive them from him, and they fa&s;tened upon his &s;ores, darted their &s;tings into his body, covered him with their mul|titudes, and inflicted on him tortures the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and in&s;upportable. The eagles of the rock tore his fle&s;h piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked
<PB N="315" REF="316">
beaks. A burning thir&s;t tormented him; he heard the river's murmur as it rolled be|&s;ide him, but &s;trove in vain to drag him|&s;elf towards the &s;ound. Blind, maimed, helple&s;s, and de&s;pairing, venting his rage in bla&s;phemy and cur&s;es, execrating his exi&s;t|ence, yet dreading the arrival of death de|&s;tined to yield him up to greater torments, &s;ix mi&s;erable days did the villain langui&s;h. On the &s;eventh a violent &s;torm aro&s;e: the winds in fury rent up rocks and fore&s;ts: the &s;ky was now black with clouds, now &s;heeted with fire: the rain fell in torrents; it &s;welled the &s;tream; the waves overflowed their banks; they reached the &s;pot where Ambro&s;io lay, and, when they abated, car|ried with them into the river the cor&s;e of the de&s;pairing monk.</P>
