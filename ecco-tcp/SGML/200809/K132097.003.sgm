<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have had a long conver&s;ation with my uncle, my dear Har|riot, on the &s;ubject of a certain
<PB N="2" REF="4">
lord&mdash;but let that re&s;t a while, that I may go on methodically.</P>
<P>Orlando, as I gue&s;&s;ed at the con|clu&s;ion of my la&s;t, left me in order to follow his friend Lord Templeton, for this purpo&s;e he bent his &s;teps towards Mrs. Bell|mour's, and met him ju&s;t coming out of her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Well (cried my brother) what news my lord? have you had
<PB N="3" REF="5">
an interview with the agreeable Mi&s;s Jane Brown?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t tell me, cried his lord&s;hip, what have I to hope? what &s;ays your charming &s;i&s;ter, did you &s;ucceed in pleading my cau&s;e? will &s;he deign to &s;ee me? to par|don me? to&mdash;</P>
<P>Not &s;o fa&s;t, my good friend, I have &s;aid all that could be &s;aid in your favour (an&s;wered my brother)
<PB N="4" REF="6">
I&s;abella, con&s;cious of her innocence is a good deal hurt at your con|duct, &s;he has a proper &s;hare of pride my Lord&mdash;however <HI>you</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly prove a better advocate than I have been.</P>
<P>Shall I then be admitted to the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her, have you my dear Rochley gained that point for me? Ah! if I am &s;o fortunate, I will not di&s;pair!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
But I &s;hall (&s;aid my brother, in|terrupting him, and &s;miling) of ever having my que&s;tion an&s;wered, if you go on at this rate, I a&s;k your lord&s;hip once more, have you &s;een that in&s;ernal witch or not?</P>
<P>Step in with me (&s;aid my lord) for they were by this time at his door, and you &s;hall hear every particular.</P>
<P>Having de&s;ired to &s;peak with Mrs. Bellmour, &s;he came to me
<PB N="6" REF="8">
immediately, when I begged to know if Mi&s;s Jane Brown was at home?</P>
<P>I believe &s;he is my lord, was the an&s;wer, wondering, I pre&s;ume what my bu&s;ine&s;s could be with the girl, and perhaps fancying, I had now ca&s;t my eyes upon her, having failed in my endeavours to &s;ucceed with the lovely Mi&s;s Rochley&mdash;&s;he rung the bell, how|ever (without requiring any ex|planation)
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and ordered Mi&s;s Brown to make her appearance.</P>
<P>In a few minutes in &s;he came, but no &s;ooner did &s;he &s;ee me, than the ro&s;es left her cheeck and gave place to the lilly&mdash;or in other words more &s;uitable to the &s;ubject, &s;he grew pale as death, and looked like the picture of horror and di&s;|may.</P>
<P>Taking her epi&s;tle from my pocket, and pre&s;enting it to her
<PB N="8" REF="10">
view (though not with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure I mu&s;t own, when I reflected on the trouble and mi&s;ery &s;he had &s;o knowingly and wickedly been the cau&s;e of) pray young woman, &s;aid I, can you recollect doing me the honor of &s;ending me this?</P>
<P>My lord, replied &s;he (with much he&s;itation and apparent di&s;tre&s;s) I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion&mdash;I expected it from the moment I
<PB N="9" REF="11">
heard of the change in Mi&s;s Rochley's &s;ituation&mdash;I did &s;end it my lord, I indeed wrote it; but &s;everely have I reproached my&s;elf for being prevailed upon to become in&s;trumental, in &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o villain|ous a tran&s;action, to &s;ay I was bribed for doing it, but adds to the crime; I will not, therefore attempt to plead that in extenuation of it.</P>
<P>Yet thus much I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay, I was a &s;tranger <HI>then</HI> to the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
lady, and was per&s;uaded to believe &s;ome of the &s;hocking circum|&s;tances contained in that letter were <HI>true</HI>&mdash;I now know the whole to be fal&s;e, and am unfeignedly &s;orry for what I have done, lady Beningfield, my lord, had art enough to&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady Beningfield! (exclaimed I)</P>
<P>Yes, my lord, it was her&s;elf, who gave me the letter to copy,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;wearing in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner, the chief articles were mat|ters of fact, that it was with a view to &s;erve your lord&s;hip, &s;he wi&s;hed you to receive it, and that if I complied, &s;he would not only give me fifty guineas in hand, but be my friend as long as &s;he lived.</P>
<P>I was too ea&s;ily prevailed upon&mdash;I blu&s;h to confe&s;s it&mdash;but am &s;omewhat con&s;oled by the re|flection that it has produced none
<PB N="12" REF="14">
of tho&s;e mi&s;chievous effects for which it was cruelly intended.</P>
<P>I once had thoughts of leaving London, in order to avoid this humiliating acknowledgment; but when I con&s;idered that by &s;o doing, I &s;hould effectually &s;creen the per&s;on who mo&s;t de&s;erved to be expo&s;ed, I determined to wait the i&s;&s;ue, and if que&s;tioned, which I could not doubt I &s;hould be, relate the whole truth as the
<PB N="13" REF="15">
only attonement I could po&s;&s;ibly make.</P>
<P>I have now done &s;o, my lord&mdash;I am con&s;cious I de&s;erve your con|tempt only&mdash;and from you madam (turning to the a&s;toni&s;hed Mrs. Bellmour) I have nothing to ex|pect, but di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from your hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We were both &s;o amazed at what we had heard, that 'twas &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="16">
time before either of us could ut|ter a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, great your guilt has been, &s;aid I, there is &s;ome merit in your &s;o candidly confe&s;&s;ing it, your manner of doing it too, is much in your favour, I therefore &s;pare my reproaches&mdash;nay, I will do more, I will even intreat Mrs. Bellmour to follow my example.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
Ah! my lord, cried the poor girl, bur&s;ting into tears&mdash;this is too much, I was prepared to bear your indignation, but this un|hoped for genero&s;ity over-powers me.</P>
<P>She was now near fainting with the violence of her agitation; and &s;o ill, I was ab&s;olutely tempted to pity her, wretch as &s;he had been! and <HI>wretch</HI> as &s;he had made me.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
In &s;hort, before I left the hou&s;e, I had prevailed on Mrs. Bellmour to give her hopes of pardon, and that &s;he would continue her in her employment.</P>
<P>And now, Rochley&mdash;what think you of that diabolical fury, Lady Beningfield?</P>
<P>Exactly what I thought before you begun your &s;tory, for I&s;abella gue&s;&s;ed it could be the work of no other.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
All I now wi&s;h is, that we could hit on &s;ome puni&s;hment adequate to the heninou&s;ne&s;s of the offence, I would give half I am worth, could I contrive to expo&s;e her as &s;he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>By Heavens! my dear friend (&s;aid his lord&s;hip) I know nothing on earth I would not &s;acrifice for that purpo&s;e, except your charm|ing &s;i&s;ter&mdash;but we may yet fall on &s;ome mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e&mdash;

at pre&s;ent I can think only of that mo&s;t injured, mo&s;t adorable of women, tell me now, my dear Rochley, when may I hope to throw my&s;elf at her feet.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip I fear mu&s;t fir&s;t throw your&s;elf at tho&s;e of my uncle, for to tell you the truth, I am apt to believe you will find in him the greate&s;t bar to your felicity, <HI>he</HI> is extremely fond of his niece, and does not think the
<PB N="19" REF="23">
man lives, who can de&s;erve her, par|ticularly him, who has pre&s;umed, even for a moment to doubt her character, though with &s;uch &s;eem|ing proof&mdash;he will not ea&s;ily par|don your giving credit to the &s;tory, though <HI>I</HI> confe&s;s it was &s;o plau&s;ibly framed, that I cannot (partial as I am to my &s;i&s;ter) wholly con|demn you.</P>
<P>But do not de&s;pair&mdash;in me you have a firm friend, and but
<PB N="20" REF="24">
for this cur&s;ed affair, could not I think have failed to find one in the brea&s;t of your (at pre&s;ent) rather angry, fair one, I told you &s;he has a proper &s;hare of pride, that pride is a good deal piqued&mdash;however we mu&s;t try what can be done.</P>
<P>I will now go and inform my uncle of what has ju&s;t pa&s;t, in order to pave the way for your lord&s;hip's reception&mdash;he was partial to you once, and doubt not in a &s;hort
<PB N="21" REF="25">
time he will become &s;o again, &s;o adieu.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, they parted, and Orlando came home, where find|ing my uncle, and your I&s;abella <HI>tete a tete,</HI> he gave us the above particulars.</P>
<P>I like his behaviour to the girl, &s;aid he, (my uncle, I mean) there was &s;omething generous in that, the poor devil could not re&s;i&s;t a
<PB N="22" REF="26">
bribe, her letters have often found it too powerful for their hone&s;ty&mdash;<HI>&s;he</HI> is beneath our notice; but that d&mdash;nd lump of quality, by Heavens! I'll have her &s;ent to bridwell, &s;he &s;hall &s;tand in the pillory! and I will hire a mob to treat her as &s;he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>We could not forbear laughing at the puni&s;hment he had found out for her, my imagination beging pretty lively, it at once &s;et her
<PB N="23" REF="27">
lady&s;hip before me in that plea&s;ant elevation.</P>
<P>May I pre&s;ume to hope, Sir, &s;aid my brother, that all things con&s;idered, you do not think his lord&s;hip quite &s;o much to blame as he at fir&s;t appeared to be.</P>
<P>You may pre&s;ume what you plea&s;e, Orlando, (&s;aid my uncle) but had his attachment been as violent as he took pains to per|&s;uade
<PB N="24" REF="28">
me it was he could not have been &s;uch a puppy, as to be im|po&s;ed upon by &s;uch a confounded improbable &s;tory.</P>
<P>The fellow mu&s;t either be a fool, or a knave; but I am inclined to &s;u&s;pect the latter.</P>
<P>It is <HI>now</HI> his intere&s;t to pretend he cannot live without my poor girl, and &s;o he is come back to try what he can do to obtain her.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="29">
No, no! had he married her, when he believed &s;he was not worth a groat, I &s;hould have had a tolerable opinion of him, but now&mdash;who will thank him?</P>
<P>But, pray my dear Sir, were you not at one time fully con|vinced, not only of his &s;incerity? but of his honorable intentions? (&s;aid Orlando) had my &s;i&s;ter acted as many others in her &s;ituation would have done, had &s;he per|mitted
<PB N="26" REF="30">
him to vi&s;it her, have you any doubt that he would gladly have married her friendle&s;s, and pennyle&s;s as &s;he then appeared to be?</P>
<P>This rather &s;taggered him, Har|riot, for that he once believed &s;o, and had every rea&s;on to believe it, he well knew.</P>
<P>What &s;ays my I&s;abella to it? turning from my brother to me,
<PB N="27" REF="31">
&s;peak freely, tell me &s;incerely whether <HI>you</HI> think he ought to be pardoned for his mon&s;trous cre|dulity? as for your brother, he mu&s;t be looked upon as prejudiced in favor of his friend.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Sir! not more &s;o, I am &s;ure, than in favor of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>O, ho!&mdash;very well!&mdash;I &s;ee how matters are likely to go, that ex|pre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="28" REF="32">
<HI>ah!</HI> was not for nothing, and &s;o you can really find in your heart to think, he is neither a <HI>fool,</HI> nor <HI>knave;</HI> but a very hand|&s;ome, and very in&s;inuating fel|low?</P>
<P>Come out with it my love, another, <HI>ah! my dear Sir!</HI> (kindly taking my hand, and &s;miling in my face) and his lord&s;hip's bu&s;ine&s;s is done.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33">
Indeed you mi&s;take me, Sir, all I meant was, to ju&s;tify my brother, I am &s;ure he would be as te|nacious of my honor as I could be my&s;elf, never would he, I am certain, pardon any man, whether his friend or foe, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to offer an in&s;ult to me.</P>
<P>Was that all, my dear child? then I mi&s;took you intirely&mdash;well then, we are not to pardon him it &s;eems, yet I could have &s;worn by

<P>We cannot prevail, you &s;ee Orlando, &s;o you may tell his lord|&s;hip, he need not take the trouble of coming here to dinner to mor|row, I&s;abella forbids it, and &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s here.</P>
<P>My brother was delighted to find he had carried his point, per|haps
<PB N="31" REF="35">
<HI>I too</HI> was not violently di&s;|plea&s;ed; but 'tis certain we were both highly entertained, and di|verted by the drollery of my uncle's manner.</P>
<P>I &s;oon after left them to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s at their lei&s;ure, and with a heart as light as a feather, &s;at down to repeat the whole to you.</P>
<P>And &s;o Harriot, I am on the point of receiving this &s;ame lord,

who has made &s;uch a bu&s;tle a|mong&s;t us, as a declared lover&mdash;well my dear, he mu&s;t e'en try what he can do in that capacity, if he can contrive to <HI>gain</HI> my heart, I have no objections; but ob&s;erve, he has not yet done it, though, that he has occa&s;ioned a few pal|pitations in it now and then, I cannot but own&mdash;being the friend of my Orlando is no &s;mall recom|mendation, let me tell you; that circum&s;tance will go a great way with me.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="37">
Don't you enjoy the idea of Lady Beningfield's &s;tanding in the pillory? it would make a capital picture.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR JAMES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t, before this, have undoubtedly heard of the &s;udden and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing tran&s;|formation in Rochley's circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="36" REF="40">
owing to the unexpected appearance of a rich uncle from India, who had for many years been &s;uppo&s;ed dead; but now, to my chagrin and bitter di&s;appoint|ment, "as I could wi&s;h the fellow &s;teeped in poverty to the very lip," is this &s;aid uncle returned loaded with wealth, which he takes pains to di&s;play with all the pomp and &s;plendor of ea&s;tern pride and magnificence, in order (as I am told) to do honor to the man,
<PB N="37" REF="41">
whom of all others, I hold in the greate&s;t abhorrence.</P>
<P>Now Caroline will in a very &s;hort time be of age, and of cour&s;e her own mi&s;tre&s;s, the con&s;equence of which is ea&s;ily fore&s;een, as &s;he will then mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly give both her&s;elf and fortune to him, who has &s;o long reigned over her in|fatuated heart.</P>
<P>Sooner than this event &s;hould take place, I would &s;ee her con|&s;igned
<PB N="38" REF="42">
to the extreme&s;t penury and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>One way there is to fru&s;trate, and perhaps render abortive their vile machinations, and but one.</P>
<P>You have often told me you liked the girl, and was de&s;irous of marrying her, you have indeed offered &s;uch terms as proves you are in earne&s;t, if this inclination &s;till continues, I have a propo&s;al to
<PB N="39" REF="43">
make you, which cannot, I think, fail in&s;uring her your's, if you coincide with my plan, which is this.</P>
<P>If you, James, will agree to play the Knight errant for once, and carry her off to Scotland, <HI>I</HI> will undertake to put her fairly into your hands, to accompli&s;h which, I have a &s;cheme, that I am morally certain will prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44">
I would &s;ee that fellow d&mdash;nd before he &s;hould marry a &s;i&s;ter of mine (he will triumph &s;ufficiently as it is) &s;ay the word, therefore, have you love enough to engage in this enterprize, have you al&s;o a &s;ufficient &s;tock of courage for it?&mdash;&s;he has a cur&s;ed deal of the woman in her temper, let me tell you, that is to &s;ay, a devil of a &s;pirit, &s;o you mu&s;t expect to be finely rated, when &s;he learns the trick we have played her.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="45">
But what of that? drive on without heeding her tongue, your de&s;igns are <HI>honorable</HI> as they call it, what would &s;he have more?</P>
<P>You cannot be le&s;s than three days upon the road, &s;he will be tired of &s;colding before you reach the end of your journey&mdash;the larum cannot la&s;t for ever, and when you <HI>have</HI> reached it, &s;end in&s;tantly for the black&s;mith, <HI>alias</HI> the par&s;on, who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">etter you
<PB N="42" REF="46">
both fa&s;t enough in the hammer|ing of an anvil.</P>
<P>What if &s;he proves <HI>re&s;tive?</HI> you'll perhaps a&s;k, what's next to be done?</P>
<P>Why lock the door, and order the fellow to read the ceremony in her hearing, then whip her into the chai&s;e again, &s;wear &s;he is to all intents and purpo&s;es your wife, or at lea&s;t &s;o much &s;o as to pre|vent
<PB N="43" REF="47">
her being lawfully the wife of any other.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> her guardian will on your re|turn confirm the union, this will terrify her, if any thing can, and finding no better may be, &s;he may chance to think, the man &s;he does not like better than none at all.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you to this? have you a mind to try the experiment? I again, &s;wear by all that's &s;acred,
<PB N="44" REF="48">
Rochley &s;hall never have her, if I can by <HI>any</HI> po&s;&s;ible means pre|vent it, &s;he de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed for daring to think of marrying a fellow who had nearly murdered her brother.</P>
<P>Send me a line to let me know your mind; take care however, your me&s;&s;enger delivers it into my own hand. I have a &s;hrewed &s;u&s;|pi&s;ion, a former one of your's (which was indeed intended for

<P>WELL Harriot, the impor|tant interview, &s;o long de&s;ired, &s;o ardently &s;olicited, is at
<PB N="57" REF="61">
length happily over&mdash;and all things are <HI>en train.</HI></P>
<P>Should his lord&s;hip on a farther acquaintance find, or which is ex|actly the &s;ame thing to him, con|tinue to fancy, I really do po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e perfections his pa&s;&s;ion had decorated me with, 'tis not diffi|cult to gue&s;s what may in due time be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>For to tell you a &s;ecret, I actually believe <HI>he</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many

more than I had given him credit for.</P>
<P>As to his per&s;on, 'tis infinitely more elegant than I &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted on, I never&mdash;no, never be|held one half &s;o graceful, &s;o com|pletely, what a man ought to be, excepting my brother, who is in my eyes equally accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But, though this I grant, is no &s;mall recommendation, yet had I
<PB N="59" REF="65">
found his mind and manner, did not de&s;erve &s;o fini&s;hed a ca&s;ket, believe me it would not have pro|duced the &s;malle&s;t effect.</P>
<P>A hand&s;ome coxcomb is of all beings to me, the mo&s;t un&s;uffer|able, I have too long had a pattern of excellence before me in my dear Orlando to be ea&s;ily plea&s;ed; how|ever, I begin to think Lord Templeton bids fair to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="66">
My uncle was for the fir&s;t half hour of his vi&s;it rather &s;tately and wavering in his opinion, the idea of his having dared to think lightly of his I&s;abella, (whatever appearances might be again&s;t her) &s;till dwelt on his mind.</P>
<P>He could not forbear a few &s;evere hints on the &s;ubject; but my Lord was &s;o attentive to him, made u&s;e of &s;o many obliging con|ciliating expre&s;&s;ions in regard to
<PB N="61" REF="67">
his pa&s;t conduct, &amp;c. &amp;c. that before the &s;econd cour&s;e was over, I could plainly &s;ee he was intirely re&s;tored to his good graces, and by the time they had fini&s;hed their claret, and joined me in the draw|ing-room to take their coffee, 'tis hard to &s;ay which appeared the greate&s;t favourite, his lord&s;hip or me.</P>
<P>My beloved Orlando is more delighted than I can expre&s;s, to
<PB N="62" REF="68">
think the very man of <HI>his</HI> choice &s;hould prove to be the <HI>man</HI> of <HI>mine,</HI> for this will certainly be the end of it, and a very agreeable ending too, Harriot, don't you think &s;o my dear?</P>
<P>I had &s;ome thoughts of being more circum&s;tantial, more minute than I have been: I meant to have told you, as well as I could, how we both looked, when introduced to each other <HI>in form;</HI> but I have
<PB N="63" REF="69">
changed my mind&mdash;'twas all very fine&mdash;very pretty indeed, as the old &s;ong &s;ays.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many other que&s;tions in the cour&s;e of the day, I a&s;ked my lord, who the elegant creature was, who was with him and the <HI>amiable</HI> Lady Beningfield, the fir&s;t time he &s;aw me?</P>
<P>Gue&s;s Orlando's &s;urpri&s;e and mine, Harriot, on his an&s;wering Mi&s;s We&s;tbury.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="70">
He now told us, &s;he had found &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance between my brother and me, that had not my name of Beverly convinced her to the contrary, &s;he could have &s;worn I was his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;drole enough, is it not?</P>
<P>Ah! my charming Mi&s;s Roch|ley &punc;continued his lord&s;hip&punc; but for that unfortunate name, I never &s;hould have appeared to you the guilty wretch you mu&s;t have thought me.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71">
Nor I neither, my lord (&s;miling) and therefore I &s;hall dete&s;t it as long as I live,</P>
<P>And don't you begin to find a kind of di&s;like growing upon you I&s;abella (&s;aid my uncle with one of his arch looks) for that of Rochley too?&mdash;young women are very apt to tire of the name they have been known by eighteen or nineteen years.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="72">
And do they never tire of that they are &s;imple enough to ex|change it for? my dear Sir&mdash;for unle&s;s you can a&s;&s;ure me they do not, I will be in no hurry to part from mine.</P>
<P>But if I can a&s;&s;ure you of it, (laughing) we are at liberty to &s;uppo&s;e you do not care how &s;oon that event happens, is it not &s;o my dear?&mdash;don't you think her &s;peech implies as much, my lord? what &s;ay you Orlando?</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73">
I de&s;ire they will take care how they pre&s;ume to put a forced con|&s;truction on any words of mine, you my dear Sir, I allow to divert your&s;elf at your I&s;abella's expence; but I would advi&s;e them to be|ware how they attempt to be witty on &s;uch a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>See what it is to be a favorite, (cried Orlando) my uncle may &s;ay what he plea&s;es with impunity, while my friend and I here are only at
<PB N="68" REF="74">
liberty to <HI>think</HI> what we plea&s;e, was not this very &s;aucy, Harriot?</P>
<P>Never will I, &s;aid my lord (tak|ing my hand) pre&s;ume either to <HI>&s;ay</HI> or <HI>think</HI> any thing that can be di&s;plea&s;ing to Mi&s;s Rochley.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, this is fine talking, (&s;aid my uncle) but make no ra&s;h vows my lord, you do not yet know her &s;o well as I do, at pre&s;ent you no doubt take her for a down|right
<PB N="69" REF="75">
divinity, an angel&mdash;but you will find her an artful in&s;inuating little baggage for all that.</P>
<P>I know not what you may take her for, replied his lord&s;hip, my dear Sir, but this I know, I can form no higher idea of felicity, than to take her as &s;he is.</P>
<P>Well, well, when I am tired of her company, perhaps I may make you a pre&s;ent of her.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">
Not till then? ah, Mr. Doug|las!</P>
<P>She will not by that time be worth your acceptance (cried my uncle, interrupting him and laugh|ing) is not that what you was going to &s;ay? &s;peak hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>Indeed he &s;hall not &s;peak hone&s;t|ly, I hate to hear di&s;agreeable truths.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">
<HI>Apropos</HI> my lord, pray have you been to pay your re&s;pects to your good friend lady Beningfield? I wi&s;h your making &s;o long a vi&s;it here, may not tempt her lady&s;hip to pay <HI>me a &s;econd.</HI></P>
<P>Let her try that joke, cried my uncle, (interrupting me, and much di&s;turbed by the recollection of what had pa&s;&s;ed) by the lord! &s;he &s;hall meet with a <HI>warm</HI> reception, by heavens! I'll trim her better
<PB N="72" REF="78">
than ever &s;he was trimmed in her life, though it may not do for a birth-day &s;uit.</P>
<P>We all &s;miled at his energy, and my lord replied, he had called the moment he found the infinite obligations &s;he had laid him under, in order to thank her as &s;he de|&s;erved; but was informed &s;he had ju&s;t &s;et off for Dover in her way to Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="79">
Where I &s;incerely hope &s;he will never arrive, cried my uncle, for I think the packet can hardly e&s;cape &s;inking that carries &s;uch a load of iniquity.</P>
<P>May the fir&s;t news I hear be, that &s;he is at the bottom of the ocean, yet the poor fi&s;h will be &s;orely di&s;appointed, &s;ince they mu&s;t be confoundedly hungry indeed, before they will venture to attack &s;uch a ma&s;s of paint and corruption.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80">
We again &s;miled at the drollery of his expre&s;&s;ions, (though in fact they were very &s;evere) and at the emotions with which he never fails to &s;peak of her lady&s;hip, nor can one be &s;urpri&s;ed, for by what I can gather from &s;ome hints Or|lando has dropped, he has not e&s;caped the venom of her tongue in the letter before mentioned, any more than I have done&mdash;the con|tents mu&s;t be horrid I fancy, &s;ince I have not yet been able to obtain a &s;ight of it.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81">
I took an opportunity to a&s;k my lord, whether he had ever &s;ent a per&s;on to enquire my name.</P>
<P>He owned he had&mdash;adding, that having &s;een me at my window two or three times, he was &s;o &s;truck with my appearance, that he could not re&s;i&s;t it; but after meeting me &s;o unexpectedly in Mrs. Bellmour's appartment, he found he was no longer ma&s;ter of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82">
What followed, Harriot, you already know, and what is &s;till likely to follow, you may without the &s;econd &s;ight venture to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Having now brought matters this length, I mu&s;t bid you adieu. I have a thou&s;and engagements upon my hands, a thou&s;and things to &s;ee in this great metropolis, to which I am at pre&s;ent intirely a &s;tranger, his lord&s;hip, I pre&s;ume (being almo&s;t one of the family)
<PB N="77" REF="83">
will contrive to give us his com|pany in all our future parties.</P>
<P>My affairs being now brought nearly to a cri&s;is (as I &s;aid before) our next care mu&s;t be to conclude tho&s;e of my dear Orlando, en|gaged as he has been in mine, he has not, however, quite neglected his own, the &s;prightly epi&s;tles he frequently receives from his be|loved, prevents de&s;pair.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Sandford-Hou&s;e.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS I believe, my dear Rochley, you intere&s;t your&s;elf more in my affairs than any other per|&s;on.
<PB N="80" REF="88">
I am now going to give you an account of an adventure that I have lately been concerned in, which though I can now laugh at, and allow you to <HI>laugh</HI> with me, was by no means agreeable, or plea&s;ant at the time.</P>
<P>You was terribly out of luck my good friend, not to find your|&s;elf ready on the &s;pot, (Don Quixote like) to deliver your poor Dulcinea from the hands of the
<PB N="81" REF="89">
ba&s;e ravi&s;her, who made &s;o bold an attempt to rob you of her for ever.</P>
<P>Sadly out of luck I &s;ay, for had you on &s;o important an occa&s;ion re&s;cued me from him, I could not have done le&s;s according to all the laws of romance, than have re|warded you with my <HI>lilly hand</HI> to ki&s;s at lea&s;t, if not to keep.</P>
<P>But you, I &s;uppo&s;e, while your poor terrified Caroline was in &s;uch
<PB N="82" REF="90">
a di&s;tre&s;sful dilemma, was flirting away with &s;ome of your London Belles, not &s;o much as be&s;towing a &s;ingle &s;igh upon her&mdash;was it &s;o Orlando?</P>
<P>To tell you a &s;ecret, did I be|lieve as much, you &s;hould not be treated with the following de|lectable hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know my brother, and I had promi&s;ed to &s;pend a
<PB N="83" REF="91">
week or ten days at Lord Sanford's, near Stamford, and you know without my telling you, his dear and worthy friend and companion Sir James Hender&s;on, has long fancied him&s;elf mo&s;t violently in love with your humble &s;ervant, a thing I ab&s;olutely deny, fully con|vinced he is as incapable of <HI>love</HI> as the pen I write with.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the creature had &s;et his fooli&s;h heart on making
<PB N="84" REF="92">
me his wife&mdash;my brother was, if po&s;&s;ible, more de&s;irous he &s;hould &s;ucceed than he was, for rea&s;ons <HI>be&s;t</HI> known to him&s;elf, though &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected by &s;omebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood matters, when we &s;et off on our intended vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved my plotting brother made a more than u&s;ual bu&s;tle on the occa&s;ion, (con&s;ider|ing
<PB N="85" REF="93">
it was but a &s;hort journey) but little dreamt I was the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, away we drove&mdash;when be|hold, ju&s;t as we had got within a mile or two of my Lord's &s;eat, one of our hor&s;es fell lame&mdash;or rather I pre&s;ume the po&s;tillion had orders to &s;ay &s;o, for I believe it was no more lame than I was.</P>
<P>I had before we &s;et out, ex|pre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at my brother's
<PB N="86" REF="94">
going with two only, he gave &s;ome &s;illy rea&s;on for it, I forget what.</P>
<P>I then, however &s;aid, had you as u&s;ual had four hor&s;es Sir John, this di&s;a&s;ter would not have been of any great con&s;equence, as we could have fini&s;hed our journey with two; but now I &s;uppo&s;e we mu&s;t enjoy the plea&s;ure of tripping it on foot.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="95">
At that moment, an empty po&s;t-chai&s;e, as I then thought it ap|peared in view, coming towards us&mdash;he called to the driver, who &s;topping, was a&s;ked, if he could convey us to Lord Sandford.</P>
<P>The lad replied, he had ju&s;t carried his ma&s;ter there, who he dur&s;t &s;ay would not object to it.</P>
<P>I was very well plea&s;ed at being &s;o conveniently accommodated,
<PB N="88" REF="96">
and followed my brother, who giving me his hand, put me into the carriage; but in&s;tead of get|ting in him&s;elf, to my a&s;toni&s;h|ment ha&s;tily &s;hut the door, and told the fellow to drive on.</P>
<P>I now found it was not as I had &s;uppo&s;ed an empty vehicle, for to my utter confu&s;ion and amaze|ment, I beheld my torment, Sir James Hender&s;on &s;queezed into one corner of it.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="97">
Merciful Heaven! (cried I) who are you? what am I to think of all this? where is my brother? how came you here? the&s;e inter|rogations were all in a moment, as I was almo&s;t out of breath with &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;the horrid wretch now made an attempt to take my hand, which I found means to prevent with a look of ineffable contempt.</P>
<P>Hear me patiently, my adorable Mi&s;s We&s;tbury, (&s;aid the creature)
<PB N="90" REF="98">
and I will immediately explain this mi&s;tery.&mdash;</P>
<P>That I have long and ardently loved you, you well know, that your brother approves my pa&s;&s;ion, you al&s;o know&mdash;I had every rea&s;on to fear you would &s;oon be&s;tow that dear, that invaluable, tho' cruelly withdrawn hand on another; on one, who though more fortunate in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the ine&s;timable trea|&s;ures of your e&s;teem and affection,
<PB N="91" REF="99">
is not perhaps more worthy of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings than him, you have &s;o repeatedly, &s;o &s;cornfully re|jected.</P>
<P>I could not bear the thought of being robbed of a felicity I value more than my life, and have there|fore had recour&s;e to this innocent &s;tratagem to get you into my power, as the only method to overcome that unaccountable aver&s;ion you have &s;o unju&s;tly entertained for one,
<PB N="92" REF="100">
who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion will end but with his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>We are now, my deare&s;t creature on the road to Scotland, where as &s;oon as we arrive, I &s;wear to make you honorably mine, by every &s;olemn tie,</P>
<P>Ah! Heaven forbid! (inter|rupting his vile harrangue, at the &s;ame time wondering at my own patience in li&s;tening &s;o long to it.)
<PB N="93" REF="101">
have you then the vanity, the a&s;|&s;urance to believe the being honor|ably your's, would be a &s;ufficient reparation for this horrid, this unpardonable in&s;ult.</P>
<P>No Sir! do not deceive your&s;elf, be a&s;&s;ured I would &s;ooner peri&s;h than be your's at any time, or on any terms.</P>
<P>If the&s;e were my &s;entiments, when in my brother's hou&s;e; can you
<PB N="94" REF="102">
be ab&s;urd enough to imagine the affronting u&s;age I have received will alter them, and render me more complying? or that you can po&s;&s;ibly force me to marry you contrary to my inclination; you cannot I think be quite &s;o ridicu|lous, though after &s;uch an in&s;tance of your wonderful contrivances and matchle&s;s confidence, it would be very near <HI>as</HI> ridiculous in me to be &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing you either do or &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="103">
This is being rather &s;evere, Mi&s;s We&s;tbury; I own I flattered my&s;elf, the &s;incerity of my pa&s;&s;ion (which after this proof of it, I believed you could no longer doubt) would have induced you to treat me with more indulgence, know|ing too I am authori&s;ed by your brother in what I have done.</P>
<P>Why, &s;urely you have not the effrontery to give this in&s;olent be|haviour as a <HI>proof</HI> of your love?</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="104">
But I &s;corn to argue the matter with you, as I am &s;ure we never &s;hall be of one opinion, &s;o all I have to beg of you Sir James is, that you will be kind enough to &s;et me down at Lord Sandford's without lo&s;s of time: on that con|dition I will endeavour to forget your egregious folly.</P>
<P>No, by Heavens! madam I will not &s;o &s;oon, nor &s;o ea&s;ily part from you, with ju&s;tice then might you
<PB N="97" REF="105">
accu&s;e me of <HI>&s;olly,</HI> if after having taken &s;o much pains to make you mine, I &s;hould &s;uffer my&s;elf to be di&s;uaded from my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have, as I told you before, (your brother's con&s;ent) and even in&s;tructions for what I have undertaken, which will fully ju&s;|tify me in the public opinion for any idea of pre&s;umptuous temerity, whatever it may do in your's, which indeed I am mo&s;t &s;olicitous about.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="106">
The wi&s;e&s;t thing, therefore, my dear Mi&s;s We&s;tbury you can now do, is to make me the happie&s;t of men, by joining your <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to that of your brother's&mdash;my for|tune! my family!</P>
<P>Talk not to me of your fortune and family! were I certain you were heir to the crown of Great Britain, I &s;hould hold you in as much contempt and dete&s;tation as I do at this moment.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="107">
So, pray Sir James order your po&s;tillion to turn back, going farther this way, you may be a&s;&s;ured can an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than expo&s;ing you, you have an enter|pri&s;ing &s;pirit, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed; but I am not &s;uch an ideot as to fancy you can &s;ucceed in this noble feat of heroi&s;m, while I have my &s;en&s;es about me.</P>
<P>He bit his lips with vexation, my cool, my compo&s;ed manner provoked him beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108">
Do me the favour to give the orders I de&s;ired (continued I) to your &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Still he paid no attention to my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>If you will not Sir James, I mu&s;t, &s;o &s;aying I made an attempt to let down the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Look ye Mi&s;s We&s;tbury, cried the horrid wretch (holding my hands to prevent me) by all that's &s;acred, you go to Scotland, on
<PB N="101" REF="109">
this I am determined, and if after being a week or ten days alone with me on &s;uch an expedition, a woman of your delicacy can think it prudent to face the world in any other character, than as my wife, I &s;hall have a wor&s;e opinion of you than I have at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The &s;tory will be rather a|gain&s;t you madam.</P>
<P>People will not ea&s;ily be inclined to credit, you could be forced into
<PB N="102" REF="110">
a trip of this nature, 'tis not every day ladies are run away with again&s;t their will.</P>
<P>I gave him the mo&s;t con|temptuous look I could a&s;&s;ume, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At length, finding all my rheto|ric had been ineffectual to make him relinqui&s;h his horrid purpo&s;e, I re&s;olved to make my&s;elf as ea&s;y as I po&s;&s;ibly could, till we reached
<PB N="103" REF="111">
the next inn, not doubting but I &s;hould then be able to intere&s;t &s;ome per&s;ons in my favour, by who&s;e means I might be delivered from the wretches tyranny.</P>
<P>We arrived at our la&s;t &s;tage about nine o'clock in the evening, when I &s;uffered him to lead me in.</P>
<P>This conde&s;cen&s;ion, I really be|lieve gave him hopes that his la&s;t wi&s;e &s;peech had made a due im|pre&s;&s;ion on me.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="112">
I de&s;ired the people of the hou&s;e, as &s;oon as we entered, to &s;hew me into a room, as I found my&s;elf much &s;atigued, both in mind and per&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir James now took the mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;ide, (and as I &s;uppo&s;e) gave her a &s;trict charge to be watchful over me, fearing, if left to my&s;elf, I &s;hould elope from him.</P>
<P>This was natural enough you know, &s;o I took no notice, but
<PB N="105" REF="113">
&s;oon after followed our ho&s;te&s;s up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>In about an hour he &s;ent his compliments to me, begging the honor of my company to &s;upper.</P>
<P>Down I went, and in &s;pite of my gloomy pro&s;pect, and very whim&s;ical &s;ituation, eat the wing of a chicken, the creature appeared delighted with my apparent change of di&s;po&s;ition, fancied all re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="106" REF="114">
was at an end, and that he &s;hould &s;hortly triumph in the conque&s;t he had gained, our conver&s;ation in|deed was uot very brilliant, but I an&s;wered all his &s;illy que&s;tions with chearfulne&s;s and temper.</P>
<P>When I was going to retire, (which I did early) he ventured to take my hand, wi&s;hing to know at what hour I would chu&s;e to proceed on our tour next morning.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="115">
O! I &s;hould not <HI>chu&s;e</HI> it at all, if I could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, but if I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely go, one hour is equally agreeable to me as a|nother.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I left him fully per|&s;uaded (as I &s;aid before) I &s;hould make no further oppo&s;ition, and as this was what I wanted him to believe, I did not repent the moderation I had ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="116">
The &s;ervant, who conducted me to my room, was a decent looking girl&mdash;I at once told her the di&s;agreeable predicament in which I was, and added, if you can con|trive to get me a po&s;t-chai&s;e, when all the family are gone to re&s;t, no matter at what hour, this pur&s;e in which you will find ten guineas &s;hall be your's&mdash;if not, I mu&s;t wait till I get to the next inn.</P>
<P>The maid confe&s;&s;ed her mi&s;tre&s;s had given her orders to lock all
<PB N="109" REF="117">
the doors leading from my appart|ment, and charged her to &s;leep, or rather &s;it up in one adjoining to it, in ca&s;e I made any attempt to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>However, madam, &s;aid &s;he, I think I may very lawfully di&s;obey her orders on an occa&s;ion like this, and certainly will do &s;o.</P>
<P>I am luckily wife to one of our po&s;tillions, and if he is at home,
<PB N="110" REF="118">
I think I can ea&s;ily prevail upon him to convey you hence&mdash;nor can I imagine either our ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s will blame us, when I in|form them of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Go my good girl, and &s;ee what you can do.</P>
<P>Away &s;he went, and pre&s;ently returned, telling me I might de|pend on her hu&s;band's being ready with the carriage at a little di&s;tance
<PB N="111" REF="119">
from the hou&s;e, this he propo&s;ed, le&s;t the noi&s;e of it might alarm the family.</P>
<P>When all was quiet, which was not till near three o'clock in the morning, my hone&s;t friend con|ducted me to it, I gave her the pur&s;e, with which &s;he was ex|tremely well &s;atisfied, and got in, bidding the fellow drive as fa&s;t as his hor&s;es could gallop to Lord Sandford's, he feared it would be
<PB N="112" REF="120">
too far, he &s;aid, without changing, but &s;aid he would try what he could do.</P>
<P>Away we flew like lightening&mdash;about &s;ix we were within a few miles of his lord&s;hip's &s;eat, and as my apprehen&s;ions were now pretty well &s;ub&s;ided, I gave him leave to go to the next inn&mdash;there I got another chai&s;e, took leave of my friend's hu&s;band, having more than gratified him for his trouble,
<PB N="113" REF="121">
and &s;oon after arrived in &s;afety at Lord Sandford's.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were no doubt &s;ur|pri&s;ed at my early appearance&mdash;but judge how much more &s;o my friend Lady Sandford was, when on en|tering the apartment, &s;he beheld me &s;eated at the breakfa&s;t table.</P>

<P>MY dear Orlando has ju&s;t given me leave to &s;end you my Harriot the inclo&s;ed letter from

his beloved, which you will be much&punc; plea&s;ed with; the great length will not admit tran&s;cribing, &s;o mu&s;t beg you will return it to me again as &s;oon as you have peru&s;ed it, and at the &s;ame time let me know your opinion of Sir John, and his very valorous and gallant friend Sir James? don't you think they make capital figures?</P>
<P>Never, &s;ure was there &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o prepo&s;terous a contrivance, nor

one more ea&s;ily eluded, the poor creatures were at their wits end, no doubt, (the road was not very long you'll &s;ay) or they never would have engaged in &s;o ab|&s;urd, &s;o contemptible an enter|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>Don't you admire Mi&s;s We&s;t|bury? how happy mu&s;t my brother be with a woman &s;o uncommonly amiable, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his great worth.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="136">
My uncle, who is now informed of their long and tender attach|ment, and the difficulties they have had to encounter, is quite charmed with her character, and &s;ays, &s;he beats me all to nothing; becau&s;e I &s;tand <HI>&s;hilly &s;hally,</HI> (as he calls it) and do not know my own mind, not having yet determined, whether I &s;hall accept Lord Temple|ton, as <HI>my lord;</HI> or refu&s;e his generous offers.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="137">
He forgets I have not yet been &s;o long acquainted with him, as Caroline as been with my brother; but whatever my uncle pretends to believe, or, however, he talks in &s;uch a je&s;ting &s;tile, I dare &s;ay he has no doubt about the matter any more than his lord&s;hip: tho' I have yet made no vows either way I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Orlando &s;at off for Lord Sand|ford's &s;eat this morning, what

tran&s;port mu&s;t he experience to be at length at liberty to vi&s;it the mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections, and freely to give vent to the grateful effu|&s;ions of his heart.</P>
<P>You never, Harriot, beheld &s;o lively, &s;o chearful a creature as he is become, judge then of my feel|ings, who &s;o truly have &s;ympa|thi&s;ed and lamented every mi&s;|fortune that has happened to one, &s;o ju&s;tly dear to me, (much more
<PB N="131" REF="139">
as you know than I did my own) and now &s;o gladly participate in his pre&s;ent felicitous pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>Do not, my dear I&s;abella, &s;aid my brother (when ju&s;t going to leave me) play the tyrant to my poor friend, let me find him as happy when I return as I am, were I not from a thorough know|ledge of <HI>his heart,</HI> certain he is worthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>your's,</HI> believe me I would be the la&s;t to urge you in his favor.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="140">
Promi&s;e me then, my dear &s;i&s;ter, that you will put an end to his cruel &s;u&s;pence before I &s;ee you again, <HI>let me find your day fixed.</HI></P>
<P>Ah! my dear brother! (inter|rupting him) that is going rather too far, you know it is impo&s;&s;ible, 'tis time enough yet to talk of&mdash;</P>
<P>And, why impo&s;&s;ible? or why <HI>time enough?</HI> (interrupting me in his turn) can it be ever too &s;oon
<PB N="133" REF="141">
to act ingenuou&s;ly with genero&s;ity and with candor; or too &s;oon to confer happine&s;s on the man who adores you, take example by my Caroline.</P>
<P>Let her then <HI>&s;et</HI> me the example, let her name <HI>her</HI> day, and I here promi&s;e my Orlando it &s;hall be mine.</P>
<P>Her's cannot be &s;o early as my ardent wi&s;hes would make it, you

<P>Why, &s;he will be at age in le&s;s than a month, and con&s;equently at liberty, and the deuce is in it, if the man cannot bear my tyranny, (as you call it) during that &s;hort time, when I am to take my chance of bearing his for ever after.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="143">
You agree then, I&s;abella, to give him your hand on the day I receive my beloveds?</P>
<P>I do! I here promi&s;e it! but for your life, not a word of this to his impatient lord&s;hip&mdash;'tis intirely <HI>entre nous,</HI> mind that Orlando.</P>

<P>I Plead guilty, my dear Harriot, yet you ought to make &s;ome allowance for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, con&s;ider how very near it is to the

time, in which I &s;hall cea&s;e to be I&s;abella Rochley, though to what|ever name I &s;hall become intitled, I can never <HI>cea&s;e</HI> to be your friend.</P>
<P>This day fortnight, Mi&s;s We&s;t|bury will be of age&mdash;and you know what the con&s;equences of that long and ardently de&s;ired event are likely to prove, no le&s;s than a pair of wives, added to the venerable li&s;t of matrons.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="152">
I need hardly tell you I am of cour&s;e immer&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s, man|tua-makers, milliners, &amp;c. with me from morning till night&mdash;car|riage, jewels, and &s;o forth, my de|lighted uncle, and no le&s;s delighted lover, have taken upon them|&s;elves to provide, which is no more than they ought to do, as you mu&s;t allow, and a mo&s;t joyous bu&s;tle the good &s;ouls are per|petually in.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="153">
I was compelled to confirm the ha&s;ty promi&s;e I had inadvertantly made to my brother, as I &s;oon found he had betrayed me, (which indeed I had before &s;u&s;pected) to his friend, the moment I had been drawn in to make it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, it does not &s;ignify, I do not intend to retract, for &s;ince this grand affair mu&s;t be complied with &s;ome time or other, one would not differ about a day or two.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="154">
I am heartily rejoiced the &s;tory of Sir John and his friend Hen|der&s;on has not tran&s;pired, I &s;hould like to be a witne&s;s to their meeting, or rather to have been, for 'tis no doubt, long &s;ince pa&s;t, as I pre|&s;ume the latter would hardly be &s;o fond of the excur&s;ion, as to proceed on his journey alone.</P>
<P>My uncle received a letter ye&s;ter|day from the happy Orlando; con|taining a very polite, and pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="147" REF="155">
invitation from Lord and Lady Sandford to him&s;elf, your I&s;abela, and Lord Templeton.</P>
<P>They intreat we will all pay them a vi&s;it immediately, and &s;tay there till the awful ceremony is over. His lord&s;hip's chaplain (Or|lando &s;ays) has undertaken the im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s of uniting us, it &s;eems he did the &s;ame good office for his amiable benefactors.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156">
After di&s;cour&s;ing over the matter among&s;t our&s;elves&punc; it was at length agreed, we &s;hould, without delay, accede to their obliging wi&s;hes, my brother pre&s;&s;es it very much, as he &s;ays, he is impatient to intro|duce his Caroline to my uncle and me; I long al&s;o for that plea&s;ure no le&s;s than he does.</P>
<P>You remember, Harriot, I once &s;aw her, though I little dreamt at that time, either who &s;he was, or
<PB N="149" REF="157">
of what is now going to happen&mdash;&s;he is lovely beyond expre&s;&s;ion in her per&s;on, and if I may believe my dear Orlando, (and her letters &s;hould be a tran&s;cript of it) her mind is no le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer was di&s;patched to my brother this morning, de&s;iring him to inform Lord and Lady Sandford, we &s;hould do our&s;elves the honor to attend them next Monday to dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="158">
Before that time, I dare &s;ay all my paraphernatia will be fini&s;hed, and I &s;hall have nothing to think of, but the day on which I &s;up|po&s;e, and am &s;adly afraid I &s;hall look exceedingly like a fool; but a per&s;on may &s;ubmit to that for once in their life, Harriot.</P>
<P>I have given a good deal of em|ployment to my friend Mrs. Bell|mour on this occa&s;ion, we are both (Caroline and my&s;elf I mean)
<PB N="151" REF="159">
to be pre&s;ented at court immediately after our transformation, &s;o I have left the care of my dre&s;s for that day intirely to her, I have &s;een many proofs of her ta&s;te, and as I have laid her under no re&s;triction in point of expence, one may pre&s;ume I &s;hall be immen&s;ely fine.</P>
<P>The poor plotting girl, (Jane Brown) has hardly yet had courage to look up&mdash;She is, I believe, as &s;incere a penitent as ever &s;inned,

<OPENER><DATELINE>Sandford-Hou&s;e.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we are my dear Harriot, and I defy the world to pro|duce a happier &s;et of beings, our reception was exactly &s;uch as I
<PB N="155" REF="163">
wi&s;hed to find it, Lord and Lady Sandford are a mo&s;t delightful couple, both hand&s;ome and plea&s;ing in their manners beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ah! it is! it is the very &s;ame charming creature! (cried Mi&s;s We&s;tbury, while my Orlando in|troduced me to her) it is the lovely Mi&s;s Beverly! with whom I was &s;o &s;truck &s;ome months ago; your very picture Rochley, never were
<PB N="156" REF="164">
two creatures &s;o much alike&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his heart, which &s;eemed to exult with tran&s;|port.</P>
<P>And I, my dear Mi&s;s We&s;tbury, could, were it nece&s;&s;ary, bring many witne&s;&s;es to prove that the elegance of your per&s;on, and &s;weet affabillity of your manner, made a no le&s;s favorable impre&s;&s;ion on me, the partiality I in&s;tantly con|ceived for you, was wholly di&s;in|tere&s;ted,
<PB N="157" REF="165">
as I found no re&s;emblance between you and any favoured lover&mdash;perhaps I am as much in|debted to that circum&s;tance for your very flattering attention as to any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed, but you are not (&s;mil|ing at the turn I had given her com|pliment) it was wholly owing to your own charms, not <HI>his</HI> I do a&s;&s;ure you, yet I will hone&s;tly confe&s;s&mdash;not if you li&s;ten though my good friend, turning to Orlando, who
<PB N="158" REF="166">
&s;tood looking at us with plea&s;ure, &s;parkling in his expre&s;&s;ive, coun|tenance&mdash;you are not to hear all our &s;ecrets, don't you know Roch|ley, li&s;teners &s;eldom hear good of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>No rule without exception, my lovely Caroline, and I am deter|mined to believe the &s;weet con|fe&s;&s;ion you was going to make would have evinced it.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="167">
Ah! the vanity of &s;ome men, (&s;miling on him) don't he de&s;erve to have his lowered a little my dear Mi&s;s Rochley? was he always thus vain?</P>
<P>No, indeed! nor had he ever before you deigned to &s;mile upon him, &s;o much rea&s;on, who would not be <HI>vain,</HI> thus highly honored&mdash;</P>
<P>Heavens! (exclaimed the lively Caroline) what an agreeable pair of flatterers.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">
O! cried Lord Sandford, coming up to us (ju&s;t as &s;he &s;aid this) if you are only engaged in flattering each other, I may as well break up your party, &s;ince we wi&s;h for &s;ome &s;hare of your conver&s;ation; but I &s;hall change the nature of it I can tell you, Lady Sandford knows I never could flatter in my life.</P>
<P>And, yet my lord, (&s;aid her lady&s;hip) I have not the vanity to
<PB N="161" REF="169">
imagine you can really fancy I de|&s;erve all the fine things you &s;o kindly &s;ay to me, I &s;hould be too happy, dur&s;t I believe them your real &s;entiments, and perhaps too <HI>vain</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Come, come, (cried my good uncle) let me make one among&s;t you, and I will &s;et you all to rights pre&s;ently, nobody will <HI>&s;u&s;|pect</HI> me I pre&s;ume of that failing, my &s;incerity has never yet been called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="170">
Then I know, (my dear Sir, &s;aid I) who has great rea&s;on to guard again&s;t a certain foible, for if that is the ca&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t be the mo&s;t perfect of all human beings.</P>
<P>We were now, Harriot, inter|rupted by a &s;ummons to table, which we found covered in the mo&s;t elegant and &s;umptuous man|ner, the entertainment, indeed was &s;uch as would have amply
<PB N="163" REF="171">
gratified the palate of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed epicurean, but was nearly thrown away upon us <HI>lovers,</HI> who chiefly fea&s;ted on each others looks.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s was depicted in every countenance, and plea&s;ure &s;at &s;miling in every feature, the con|ver&s;ation as you may imagine was chearful and expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;atisfaction we enjoyed in our happy meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="172">
A good deal of company a&s;|&s;embled in the evening, &s;ome &s;at down to cards, others to chat, in the latter cla&s;s were included Mi&s;s We&s;tbury, and your I&s;abella, our beaux, you may believe, followed our example.</P>
<P>Great things are talked of for a certain day, we propo&s;ed a ma&s;ked ball, &s;ince they were at all events determined to make a &s;how of us; but to this, my uncle objected,
<PB N="165" REF="173">
politely complimenting us by &s;ay|ing faces like ours were not made to be concealed; a ball, however, is re&s;olved on, and half the country is to be invited.</P>
<P>Caroline and her Orlando intend writing to Sir John on the occa&s;ion, his having behaved ill is no rule to them, his con&s;ent to their union is to be a&s;ked, though it is in fact a mere compliment, &s;ince it certainly does not depend upon
<PB N="166" REF="174">
his an&s;wer&mdash;what that an&s;wer will be, Heaven only knows, not very gracious we apprehend.</P>
<P>Our good uncle has put it in my brother's power to offer &s;uch &s;ettlements as Sir John cannot re|fu&s;e however, he may object to the <HI>&s;ettler</HI>&mdash;to your I&s;abella he pre&s;ents twenty thou&s;and pound on the day &s;he gives her hand to Lord Templeton.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175">
Can I ever, my friend, be &s;uf|ficiently thankful to providence for rai&s;ing us &s;o generous, &s;o noble a benefactor, who with &s;uch unbounded liberality, has contributed to our felicity, may Heaven pre&s;erve his precious life, and enable us by our grateful at|tention, to his every wi&s;h, render his latter days happy.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, adieu: ah! Harriot! I am going for the la&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="176">
time to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf your truly affectionate and &s;incere friend, by the loved name of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER the Forty-fir&s;t.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady TEMPLETON, TO Mi&s;s LENOX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Sandford-Hou&s;e.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM actually married, Harriot!&mdash;ab&s;olutely a wife to all in|tents and purpo&s;es!</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="178">
Yet would you believe it, I am &s;till the very &s;ame kind of girl I was before the important event took place? I do all I can how|ever to a&s;&s;ume a grave, matronly appearance, and try to give my|&s;elf a few con&s;equential airs; but I make a &s;ad hand of it, nor does my &s;i&s;ter &s;ucceed much better, nay wor&s;e I verily think, for &s;he is, if po&s;&s;ible, more giddy, more lively than ever, however time may do much, indeed my lord in|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="171" REF="179">
upon it I am already in every re&s;pect a pattern of all per|fection.</P>
<P>Orlando &s;eems inclined to think, that his Caroline alone merits that character, though I believe he al|lows his I&s;abella is intitled to &s;tand &s;econd on the li&s;t.</P>
<P>Dear creatures! all I a&s;k of Heaven, is that they may continue through life to think of us, as
<PB N="172" REF="180">
they do at pre&s;ent; can we flatter our&s;elves this will be the ca&s;e, Har|riot?&mdash;I dare not an&s;wer that que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Sir John has not thought fit to take any notice of either of the letters, and as he did not, his &s;ilence was taken as con&s;ent, this he no doubt expected&mdash;they did their duty, if he would not fol|low their example, who can help it?</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="181">
Lord and Lady Sandford have agreed to accompany us to town, and to &s;pend the re&s;t of the winter there, my kind uncle makes a point of it, that Orlando and his fair wife are to take up their re|&s;idence with him in Portland-Place, &s;aying he &s;hould be mi&s;er|able, were he deprived of us both.</P>
<P>As for poor I&s;abella! you know, Harriot, I mu&s;t follow my lord
<PB N="174" REF="182">
and ma&s;ter, his hou&s;e is in Portman-Square, and I am told &s;uperb.</P>
<P>And to that hou&s;e, Harriot, I am <HI>ordered</HI> by him to give you an invitation, which you are ear|ne&s;tly intreated to accept of im|mediately.</P>
<P>Set off then, my dear girl with|out lo&s;s of time, come and con|gratulate your friend on her
<PB N="175" REF="183">
felicity, 'tis as perfect as I can wi&s;h, and more &s;o than a frail mortal has any right to expect, (but if there is a po&s;&s;ibility) it will receive a con&s;iderable augmen|tation, if my Harriot will be &s;o obliging as to indulge me with her company.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome thoughts of making a match between you and my good uncle, he can have no objections, and &s;urely you will not pre&s;ume
<PB N="176" REF="184">
to <HI>object</HI> becoming the aunt of one you have from infancy loved, and who will ever remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t affectionate, and &s;incere friend,
