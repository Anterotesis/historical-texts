<P>IT may be proper to inform the Reader, that the mo&s;t Part of the following Pieces were wrote without any De&s;ign of their ever appearing in Print; the Author's Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the Di&s;advantage he lay un|der, hindering him from a&s;piring to the Rank of a Poet: But the generous Encou|ragement he met with from &s;ome Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, to whom he had the Honour of being made known, determined him to offer his Productions to the Publick. It will be needle&s;s, perhaps, to declare, that he has had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Learning. He takes this Opportunity of returning Thanks to all his Sub&s;cribers, and generous Benefactors, de|claring his Ambition to extend no farther, than that of producing &s;omething not alto|gether unworthy their Countenance and Favour.</P>
