<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the nobility of Bri|tain were &s;aid, by the Poet Laureat, to admire and protect the arts, and were known by the whole nation to be the patrons of mu&s;ic,&mdash;William and Henry, youths under twenty years of age, bro|thers, and the &s;ons of a country &s;hop|keeper who had lately died in&s;olvent, &s;et out on foot for London, in the hope of procuring by their indu&s;try a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>As they walked out of their native town, each with a &s;mall bundle at his back, each ob&s;erved the other drop &s;e|veral tears: but, upon the &s;udden meet|ing of their eyes, they both &s;miled with a degree of di&s;dain at the weakne&s;s in which they had been caught.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">"I am &s;ure," &s;aid William (the elder) "I don't know why I cry."</P>
<P>"Nor I neither," &s;aid Henry: "for though we may never &s;ee this town again, yet we leave nothing behind us to give us cau&s;e to lament."</P>
<P>"No," replied William; "nor any body who cares what becomes of us."</P>
<P>"But I was thinking," &s;aid Henry, now weeping bitterly, "that if my poor father were alive, <HI>he</HI> would care what was to become of us:&mdash;he would not have &s;uf|fered us to begin this long journey with|out a few &s;hillings more in our pockets."</P>
<P>At the end of this &s;entence, William, who had with &s;ome effort &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his tears while his brother &s;poke, now uttered, with a voice almo&s;t inarticulate,&mdash;"Don't &s;ay any more; don't talk any more about it. My father u&s;ed to tell us, that when he was gone we mu&s;t take care of our|&s;elves: and &s;o we mu&s;t. I only wi&s;h," continued he, giving way to his grief, "that I had never done any thing to offend him while he was living."</P>
<P>"That is what I wi&s;h too," cried Henry. "If I had always been dutiful
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to him while he was alive, I would not &s;hed one tear for him now that he is gone: but I would thank heaven that he had e&s;caped from his creditors."</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation &s;uch as this, wherein their &s;orrow for their decea&s;ed parent &s;eemed le&s;s for his death, than becau&s;e he had not been &s;o happy when living, as they ought to have made him; and wherein their own outca&s;t fortune was le&s;s the &s;ubject of their grief, than the reflection "what their father would have endured, could he have beheld them in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation;" in conver&s;ation &s;uch as this, they pur&s;ued their journey till they arrived at that metropolis, which has received for centuries pa&s;t, from the provincial towns, the bold adventurer of every denomination; has &s;tampt his cha|racter with experience and example; and, while it has be&s;towed on &s;ome coronets and mitres&mdash;on &s;ome the la&s;ting fame of genius&mdash;to others has dealt beggary, in|famy, and untimely death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a trial of three weeks pa&s;&s;ed in London, a year followed, during which, William and Henry never &s;at down to a dinner, or went into a bed, without hearts glowing with thankfulne&s;s to that pro|vidence which had be&s;towed on them &s;uch unexpected ble&s;&s;ings; for no longer did they pre&s;ume to expect (what &s;till they pre&s;umed they de&s;erved) a &s;ecure pittance for them&s;elves in this world of plenty. Their experience, &s;ince they came to town, had informed them that, to obtain a permanent livelihood, is the good fortune but of a part of tho&s;e who are in want of it: and the precarious earning of half a crown, or a &s;hilling, in the neighbourhood where they lodged, by an errand, or &s;ome &s;uch accidental means, was the &s;ole &s;upport which they at pre&s;ent enjoyed.</P>
<P>They had &s;ought for con&s;tant, employ|ment of various kinds, and even for &s;er|vants'
<PB N="7" REF="6">
places; but ob&s;tacles had always occurred to prevent their &s;ucce&s;s. If they applied for the &s;ituation of a clerk to a man of exten&s;ive concerns, their qua|lifications were admitted; but there mu&s;t be &s;ecurity given for their fidelity: they had friends, who would give them a cha|racter, but who would give them nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>If they endeavoured for the place even of a menial &s;ervant, they were too clowni&s;h and awkward for the pre&s;ence of the lady of the hou&s;e;&mdash;and once, when William (who had been educated at the free grammar-&s;chool of the town in which he was born, and was an excellent &s;cholar) hoping to obtain the good opinion of a young clergyman whom he &s;olicited for the favour of waiting upon him, ac|quainted him "That he under&s;tood Greek and Latin," he was rejected by the divine, "becau&s;e he could not dre&s;s hair."</P>
<P>Weary of repeating their mean accom|pli&s;hments of "hone&s;ty, &s;obriety, hu|mility," and on the precipice of repro|bating &s;uch qualities,&mdash;which, however
<PB N="8" REF="7">
beneficial to the &s;oul, gave no hope of pre&s;ervation to the body,&mdash;they were prevented from this profanation by the fortunate remembrance of one qualifica|tion; which Henry, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, in all his di&s;tre&s;s, had never till then called to his recollection: but which, being once remembered and made known, changed the whole pro&s;pect of wretchedne&s;s placed before the two brothers; and they never knew want more.</P>
<P>Reader, not to keep you in &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning this attribute&mdash;Henry could play upon the fiddle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was it publicly known that Henry could play mo&s;t excellently upon the violin, than he was invited into many companies where no other accompli&s;h|ment could have introduced him. His performance was &s;o much admired, that he had the honour of being admitted to &s;everal tavern fea&s;ts, of which he had al&s;o the honour to partake without par|taking of the expence. He was &s;oon ad|dre&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons of the very fir&s;t rank and fa&s;hion, and was once &s;een walking &s;ide by &s;ide with a peer.</P>
<P>But yet, in the mid&s;t of this powerful occa&s;ion for rejoicing, Henry, who&s;e heart was particularly affectionate, had one grief that eclip&s;ed all the happine&s;s of his new life:&mdash;his brother William could <HI>not</HI> play on the fiddle!&mdash;con&s;equently, his brother William, with whom he had &s;hared &s;o much ill, could not &s;hare in his good fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">One evening, Henry, coming home from a dinner and concert at the Crown and Anchor, found William, in a very gloomy and peevi&s;h humour, poring over <HI>De Oratore</HI> of Cicero. Henry a&s;ked him &s;everal times "How he did;" and &s;imilar que&s;tions, marks of his kind di&s;po&s;ition towards his beloved brother: but all his endeavours, he perceived, could not &s;oothe or &s;often the &s;ullen mind of Wil|liam. At length, taking from his pocket a handful of almonds, and &s;ome delicious fruit (which he had purloined from the plenteous table, where his brother's wants had never been ab&s;ent from his thoughts) and laying them down before him, he exclaimed with a benevolent &s;mile, "Do, William, let me teach you to play upon the violin."</P>
<P>William&mdash;full of the great orator whom he was then &s;tudying, and &s;till more alive to the impo&s;&s;ibility that <HI>his</HI> ear, attuned only to &s;en&s;e, could ever de&s;cend from that elevation, to learn mere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">unds&mdash;William caught up the tempting pre&s;ents which Henry had ventured his reputation to obtain for him, and threw them all in|dignantly at the donor's head.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">Henry felt too powerfully his own &s;u|periority of fortune, to re&s;ent this ingra|titude; he only picked up the repa&s;t, and laying it again upon the table, placed by its &s;ide a bottle of claret, which he held fa&s;t by the neck, while he a&s;&s;ured his brother, that, "although he had taken it while the waiter's back was turned, yet it might be drank with a &s;afe con&s;cience by them; for he had not him&s;elf ta&s;ted one drop at the fea&s;t, on purpo&s;e that he might enjoy a gla&s;s with his brother at home, and without wronging the com|pany who had invited him."</P>
<P>The affection Henry expre&s;&s;ed as he &s;aid this,&mdash;or the force of a bumper of wine, which William had not &s;een &s;ince he left his father's hou&s;e,&mdash;had &s;uch an effect in calming the di&s;plea&s;ure he was cheri&s;hing, that, on his brother's offering him the gla&s;s, he took it; and he deigned even to eat of his pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Henry, to convince him that he had &s;tinted him&s;elf, to obtain for him this col|lation, &s;at down and partook of it.</P>
<P>After a few gla&s;&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed, he again ventured to &s;ay, "Do, brother William, let me teach you to play on the violin."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">Again his offer was refu&s;ed; but though with le&s;s vehemence, at length they both agreed the attempt could not pro&s;per.</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Henry, "William, go down to Oxford, or to Cambridge. There, no doubt, they are as fond of learning, as in this gay town they are of mu&s;ic. You know you have as much talent for the one as I for the other: do go to one of our uni|ver&s;ities, and &s;ee what dinners, what &s;up|pers and what friends <HI>you</HI> will find there."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM <HI>did</HI> go to one of tho&s;e &s;eats of learning, and would have &s;tarved there, but for the affectionate remittances of Henry, who &s;hortly became &s;o great a proficient in the art of mu&s;ic, as to have it in his power not only to live in a very reputable manner him&s;elf, but to &s;end &s;uch &s;upplies to his brother, as to enable him to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>With &s;ome, the progre&s;s of fortune is rapid. Such is the ca&s;e when, either on merit or demerit, great patronage is be|&s;towed. Henry's violin had often charmed, to a welcome forgetfulne&s;s of his in&s;ig|nificance, an effeminate lord; or warmed with ideas of honour, the head of a duke, who&s;e heart could never be taught to feel its manly glow. Princes had flown to the arms of their favourite fair-ones, with more rapturous delight, &s;oftened by the ma&s;terly touches of his art: and tho&s;e elevated per&s;onages, evergrateful to tho&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="13">
from whom they derive benefits, were competitors in the de&s;ire of heaping favours upon him. But he, in all his advantages, never once lo&s;t from his thoughts the hope of &s;ome advantage for his brother William: and when at any time he was pre&s;&s;ed by a patron to demand a "token of his regard," he would con&s;tantly reply:</P>
<P>"I have a brother, a very learned man, if your lord&s;hip (your grace, or your royal highne&s;s) would confer &s;ome &s;mall favour on him&mdash;"</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip would reply, "He was &s;o teazed and hara&s;&s;ed in his youth by learned men, that he had ever &s;ince de|te&s;ted the whole fraternity."</P>
<P>His grace would inquire "If the learned man could play upon any in&s;trument."</P>
<P>And his highne&s;s would a&s;k "If he could &s;ing."</P>
<P>Rebuffs &s;uch as the&s;e poor Henry met with in all his applications for William, till one fortunate evening, at the conclu|&s;ion of a concert, a great man &s;hook him by the hand, and promi&s;ed a living of five hundred a year (the incumbent of
<PB N="15" REF="14">
which was upon his death-bed) to his brother, in return for the entertainment Henry had ju&s;t given him.</P>
<P>Henry wrote in ha&s;te to William, and began his letter thus: "My dear brother, I am not &s;orry you did not learn to play upon the fiddle."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE incumbent of this living died&mdash;William was ordained: and in a few weeks came to town, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gift, which his brother's &s;kill had ac|quired him.</P>
<P>William had a &s;teady countenance, a &s;tern brow, and a maje&s;tic walk; all of which this new acce&s;&s;ion, this holy call|ing to religious vows, rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed. In the early part of his life, the violin of his brother had rather irritated than &s;oothed the moro&s;e di&s;po|&s;ition of his nature: and though, &s;ince their departure from their native habita|tion, it had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his hunger, it had never been &s;ucce&s;sful in appea&s;ing the di&s;turbed pa&s;|&s;ions of a proud and a di&s;dainful mind.</P>
<P>As the painter views with delight and wonder the fini&s;hed picture, expre&s;&s;ive te&s;timony of his ta&s;te and genius: as the phy&s;ician beholds with pride and glad|ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the recovering invalid, whom his art has &s;natched from the jaws of death: as the father gazes with rapture on his fir&s;t child, the creature to whom he has given life&mdash;&s;o did Henry &s;urvey with tran&s;port|ing glory, his brother, dre&s;t for the fir&s;t time in his canonicals, to preach at his pari&s;h church. He viewed him from head to foot&mdash;&s;miled&mdash;viewed again&mdash;pulled one &s;ide of his gown a little this way, one end of his band a little that way&mdash;then &s;tole behind him, pretending to place the curls of his hair, but in reality, to in|dulge, and to conceal, tears of fraternal pride and joy.</P>
<P>William was not without joy: neither was he wanting in love or gratitude to his brother&mdash;but his pride was not com|pletely &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>"I am elde&s;t brother," he thought to him&s;elf, "and a man of literature; and yet am I obliged to my younger, an illi|terate man."&mdash;Here he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every thought that could be a reproach to that brother. But there remained an object of his former contempt, now become even dete&s;table to him&mdash;ungrateful man!
<PB N="18" REF="17">
the very agent of his elevation was now &s;o odious to him, that he could not ca&s;t his eyes upon the friendly violin, without in&s;tant emotions of di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>In vain would Henry at times endea|vour to &s;ubdue his haughtine&s;s, by a tune on this wonderful machine.&mdash;"You know I have no ear," William would &s;ternly &s;ay, in recompen&s;e for one of Henry's be&s;t &s;olo's. Yet was William enraged at Henry's an&s;wer, when, after taking him to hear him preach, he a&s;ked him "how he liked his &s;ermon," and Henry replied (merely with plea&s;antry, and in the tech|nical phra&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion) "You know, brother, I have no ear."</P>
<P>Henry's renown in his profe&s;&s;ion daily increa&s;ed; and with his fame, his friends. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the virtues of humility and charity, far above William, the pro|fe&s;t teacher of tho&s;e virtues, his reverend brother's di&s;re&s;pect for his vocation, never once made him relax for a moment in his anxiety to advance him in <HI>his.</HI>&mdash;Within a year or two, he had the gratification of pre&s;enting him to a deanery; and at once placed between them an in&s;urmountable
<PB N="19" REF="18">
barrier to all friend&s;hip, that was not the effect of conde&s;cen&s;ion, on the part of the dean.</P>
<P>William would now begin &s;eriou&s;ly to remon&s;trate with his brother "upon his u&s;ele&s;s occupation," and would intimate "the degradation it was to him, to hear his frivolous talent &s;poken of in all com|panies." Henry believed his brother much wi&s;er than him&s;elf, and &s;uffered &s;hame that he was not more worthy of &s;uch a relation. To con&s;ole him&s;elf for the familiar friend, whom he now per|ceived he had entirely lo&s;t, he &s;earched for one of a &s;ofter nature&mdash;he married.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>AS Henry de&s;paired of receiving his brother's approbation of his choice, he never mentioned the event to him: but William, being told of it by a third per|&s;on, inquired of Henry, who confirmed the truth of the intelligence, and ac|knowledged, that, in taking a wife, his &s;ole view had been, to obtain a kind companion and friend, who would bear with his failings, and know how to e&s;teem his few qualifications; therefore, he had cho&s;en one of his own rank in life, and who, having a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, and, as well as him&s;elf, an obligation to the art&mdash;</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," cried the dean, "that what has been hinted to me is true? Is it po&s;&s;ible that you have married a public finger?"</P>
<P>"She is as good as my&s;elf," returned Henry: "I did not wi&s;h her to be better, for fear &s;he &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e me."</P>
<P>"As to de&s;pi&s;e," (an&s;wered the dean) "heaven forbid that we &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="20">
any one&mdash;that would be acting unlike a chri&s;tian&mdash;but do you imagine I can ever introduce her to my intended wife, who is a woman of family?"</P>
<P>Henry had received in his life many in&s;ults from his brother: but, as he was not a vain man, he generally, thought his brother in the right, and con&s;equently &s;ubmitted with patience&mdash;but though he had little &s;elf-love, he had for his wife an unbounded affection: on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, therefore, he began to rai&s;e his voice, and even (in the coar&s;e expre&s;&s;ion of clowni&s;h anger) to lift his hand&mdash;but the &s;udden and affecting recollection of what he had done for the dean&mdash;of the pains, the toils, the hopes, and the fears he had experienced when &s;oliciting his preferment&mdash;this recollection overpower|ed his &s;peech&mdash;weakened his arm&mdash;and deprived him of every active force, but that of flying out of the dean's hou&s;e (in which they then were) as &s;wift as light|ning, while the dean &s;at proudly contem|plating&mdash;"that he had done his duty."</P>
<P>For &s;everal days Henry did not call, as was his cu&s;tom, to &s;ee his brother. Wil|liam's
<PB N="22" REF="21">
marriage drew near, and he &s;ent a formal card to invite him on that day; but not having had the conde&s;cen&s;ion to name his &s;i&s;ter-in-law in the invitation, Henry took no notice of it; and the joy|ful event was celebrated without his pre|&s;ence. But the ardour of the bridegroom was not &s;o vehement as to overcome every other &s;en&s;ation&mdash;he mi&s;&s;ed his brother&mdash;that heart-felt cheerfulne&s;s with which Henry had ever given him joy upon every happy occa&s;ion&mdash;even amid&s;t all the po|liter congratulations of his other friends&mdash;&s;eemed to the dean mournfully wanting. This derogation from his felicity he was re&s;olved to re&s;ent&mdash;and for a whole year the&s;e brothers, whom adver&s;ity had en|twined clo&s;ely together, pro&s;perity &s;e|parated.</P>
<P>Though Henry, on his marriage, paid &s;o much attention to his brother's pre|judices, as to take his wife from her public employment, this had not &s;o entirely re|moved the &s;cruples of William, as to per|mit him to think her a worthy companion for Lady Clementina, the daughter of a poor Scotch earl, whom he had cho&s;en,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
merely that he might be proud of her family; though, in return, he &s;hould &s;uffer that family to be a&s;hamed of <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>If Henry's wife was not fit company for Lady Clementina, it is to be hoped &s;he was company for angels&mdash;&s;he died within the fir&s;t year of her marriage, a faithful, an affectionate wife and a mother.</P>
<P>When William heard of her death, he felt a &s;udden &s;hock&mdash;and a kind of fleet|ing thought glanced acro&s;s his mind, that</P>
<P>"Had he known &s;he had been &s;o near her di&s;&s;olution, &s;he might have been in|troduced to Lady Clementina: and he him&s;elf would have called her &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>That is (if he had defined his fleeting idea) "they would have had no objec|tion to have met this poor woman for the <HI>la&s;t time;</HI> and would have de&s;cended to the familiarity of kindred, in order to have wi&s;hed her a good journey to the other world."</P>
<P>Or, is there in death &s;omething that &s;o rai&s;es the abjectne&s;s of the poor, that, on their approach to its &s;heltering abode, the arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied, and trembles?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE wife of Henry had been dead near &s;ix weeks before the dean heard the news: a month then elap&s;ed in thoughts by him&s;elf, and con&s;ultations with Lady Clementina, how he &s;hould conduct him|&s;elf, on this occurrence. Her advice was,</P>
<P>"That as Henry was the younge&s;t, and by their &s;tations, in every &s;en&s;e, the dean's inferior, he ought fir&s;t to make overtures of reconciliation."</P>
<P>The dean an&s;wered, "He had no doubt of his brother's good will to him: but that he had rea&s;on to think, from the knowledge of his temper, he would be more likely to come to him upon an oc|ca&s;ion to be&s;tow comfort, than to receive it: for in&s;tance, if I had &s;uffered the misfortune of lo&s;ing you, my brother, I have no doubt, would have forgotten his re&s;entment, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>She was offended that the lo&s;s of the vulgar wife of Henry &s;hould be com|pared to the lo&s;s of her&mdash;&s;he lamented her
<PB N="25" REF="24">
indi&s;cretion in forming an alliance with a family of no rank, and implored the dean to wait till his brother &s;hould make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ion to him, before he re|newed the acquaintance.</P>
<P>Though Lady Clementina had men|tioned on this occa&s;ion her <HI>indi&s;cretion,</HI> &s;he was of a prudent age&mdash;&s;he was near forty&mdash;yet, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing rather a hand&s;ome face and per&s;on, &s;he would not have impre&s;&s;ed the &s;pectator with an idea that &s;he was near &s;o old, had &s;he not con&s;tantly at|tempted to appear much younger. Her dre&s;s was fanta&s;tically fa&s;hionable, her manners affected all the various pa&s;&s;ions of youth, and her conver&s;ation was per|petually embelli&s;hed with accu&s;ations upon her own "heedle&s;sne&s;s, thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, carele&s;sne&s;s, and childi&s;hne&s;s."</P>
<P>There is perhaps, in every individual, one parent motive to every action, good or bad: be that as it will, it was evident, that with Lady Clementina, all &s;he &s;aid or did, all &s;he thought or looked, had but one foundation&mdash;vanity.&mdash;If &s;he was nice, or if &s;he was negligent, vanity was the cau&s;e of both; for &s;he would con|template

with the highe&s;t degree of &s;elf-complacency "what &s;uch a one would &s;ay of her elegant preci&s;ene&s;s, or what &s;uch a one would think of her intere&s;ting neglect."</P>
<P>If &s;he complained &s;he was ill, it was with the certainty that her languor would be admired; if &s;he boa&s;ted &s;he was well, it was that the &s;pectator might admire her glowing health; if &s;he laughed, it was becau&s;e &s;he thought it made her look pretty; if &s;he cried, it was becau&s;e &s;he thought it made her look prettier &s;till. If &s;he &s;colded her &s;ervants, it was from va|nity, to &s;how her &s;uperior knowledge to theirs; and &s;he was kind to them from the &s;ame vice, that her benevolence might excite their admiration.&mdash;Forward, and impertinent in the company of her equals from the vanity of &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf above them, &s;he was ba&s;hful even to &s;hame-facedne&s;s in the pre&s;ence of her &s;uperiors, becau&s;e her vanity told her &s;he engro&s;&s;ed all their ob&s;ervation. Through vanity &s;he had no memory; for &s;he con&s;tantly forgot every thing &s;he heard others &s;ay, from the minute attention which &s;he paid to every thing &s;he &s;aid her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">She had become an old maid from vanity, believing no offer &s;he received worthy of her de&s;erts; and when her power of farther conque&s;t began to be doubted, &s;he married from vanity to repair the character of her fading charms. In a word, her vanity was of that mag|nitude, that &s;he had no idea but that &s;he was humble in her own opinion; and it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have con|vinced her that &s;he thought well of her|&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he thought <HI>&s;o well,</HI> as to be a&s;&s;ured, that her own thoughts under|valued her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT, which in a weak woman is called vanity, in a man of &s;en&s;e, is termed pride&mdash;make one a degree &s;tronger, or the other a degree weaker, and the dean and his wife were infected with the &s;elf-&s;ame folly. Yet, do not let the reader &s;uppo&s;e that this failing (however de|&s;picable) had era&s;ed from either bo&s;om all traces of humanity. They are human creatures who are meant to be pourtrayed in this little book, and where is the human creature who has not &s;ome good qualities to &s;often, if not counterbalance his bad ones?</P>
<P>The dean, with all his pride, could not wholly forget his brother, nor eradicate from his remembrance the friend he had been to him&mdash;he re&s;olved therefore, in &s;pite of his wife's advice, to make him &s;ome overture, which he had no doubt but Henry's good nature would in&s;tantly accept. The more he became acquainted with all the vain and &s;elfi&s;h propen&s;ities
<PB N="29" REF="28">
of Lady Clementina, the more he felt a returning affection for his brother: but little did he &s;u&s;pect how much he loved him, till (after &s;ending to various places to enquire for him) he learnt&mdash;that on his wife's decea&s;e, unable to &s;upport her lo&s;s in the &s;urrounding &s;cene, Henry had taken the child &s;he brought him in his arms, &s;haken hands with all his former friends&mdash;pa&s;&s;ing over his brother in the number&mdash;and &s;et &s;ail in a ve&s;&s;el bound for Africa, with a party of Portugue&s;e and &s;ome few Engli&s;h adventurers, to people there the uninhabited part of an exten&s;ive i&s;land.</P>
<P>This was a re&s;olution, in Henry's cir|cum&s;tances, worthy a mind of &s;ingular &s;en&s;ibility: but William had not di&s;|cerned, till then, that every act of Henry's was of the &s;ame de&s;cription; and more than all, his every act towards him. He &s;taggered when he heard the tidings; at fir&s;t thought them untrue; but quickly recollected that Henry was capable of &s;urpri&s;ing deeds! He recollected, with a force that gave him torture, the benevo|lence his brother had ever &s;hown towards
<PB N="30" REF="29">
him&mdash;the favours he had heaped upon him&mdash;the in&s;ults he had patiently en|dured in requital!</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t emotion, which this intel|ligence gave the dean, he forgot the dig|nity of his walk and ge&s;ture&mdash;He ran with frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m to every corner of his hou&s;e where the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of what belonged to Henry, remained&mdash;He pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to his brea&s;t, with tender agony, a coat of his, which by accident had been left there&mdash;He ki&s;&s;ed and wept over a walking-&s;tick which Henry once had given him&mdash;He even took up a mu&s;ic-book of his brother's with delight&mdash;nor would his poor violin, had it been there, have then excited anger.</P>
<P>When his grief became more calm, he &s;at in deep and melancholy meditation, calling to mind, when, and where he &s;aw his brother la&s;t. The recollection gave him fre&s;h cau&s;e of regret. He remem|bered they had parted on his refu&s;al to &s;uffer Lady Clementina to admit the ac|quaintance of Henry's wife.&mdash;Both Henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond the reach of his pride; and he felt the meanne&s;s of his triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">To add to his &s;elf-reproaches, he be|held in his tormented memory the coun|tenance of his brother at their la&s;t inter|view, as it changed, while he cen&s;ured his marriage, and treated with di&s;re&s;pect the object of his conjugal affection. He remembered the anger repre&s;&s;ed, the tear bur&s;ting forth, and the la&s;t glimp&s;e he had of him, as he left his pre&s;ence for ever.</P>
<P>In vain he now wi&s;hed, that he had followed him to the door&mdash;that he had once &s;haken hands and owned his obli|gations to him before they had parted. In vain he wi&s;hed too, that, in this ex|treme agony of his mind, he had &s;uch a friend to comfort him, as Henry had ever proved.</P>

<P>THE avocations of an elevated life era&s;e the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions&mdash;the dean, in a few months, recovered of tho&s;e which his brother's departure fir&s;t made upon him; and would now at times even condemn, in anger, Henry's having &s;o ha&s;tily abandoned him and his native country, in re&s;entment, as he conceived, of a few misfortunes which his u&s;ual for|titude &s;hould have taught him to bear. Yet, was he &s;till de&s;irous of his return, and wrote two or three letters expre&s;&s;ive of his wi&s;h, which he anxiou&s;ly endea|voured &s;hould reach him. But many years elap&s;ing without any intelligence from him, and a report having arrived that he, and all the party with whom he went, were &s;lain by the &s;avage inhabit|ants of the i&s;land, William's de&s;pair of &s;eeing his brother again, cau&s;ed the de|&s;ire to dimini&s;h; while attention and af|fection to a &s;till nearer and dearer relation than Henry ever was to him, now chiefly engaged his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">Lady Clementina had brought him a &s;on, on whom, from his infancy, he doated&mdash;and the boy, in riper years, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a hand&s;ome per&s;on and evincing a quickne&s;s of parts, gratified the father's darling, pa&s;&s;ion, pride; as well as the mother's vanity.</P>
<P>The dean had, be&s;ides this child, a dome&s;tic comfort highly gratifying to his ambition: the bi&s;hop of **** became intimately acquainted with him &s;oon after his marriage, and from his daily vi&s;its had become, as it were, a part of the family. This was much honour to the dean, not only as the bi&s;hop was his &s;uperior in the church, but was of that part of the bench who&s;e blood is enno|bled by a race of ance&s;tors, and to which, all wi&s;dom on the plebeian &s;ide crouches in humble re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Year after year rolled on in pride and grandeur; the bi&s;hop and the dean pa&s;&s;ing their time in attending levees and in talk|ing politics; Lady Clementina pa&s;&s;ing hers in attending routs and in talking of <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> till the &s;on arrived at the age of thirteen.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">Young William pa&s;&s;ed <HI>his</HI> time, from morning till night, with per&s;ons who taught him to walk, to ride, to talk, to think like a man&mdash;a fooli&s;h man, in&s;tead of a wi&s;e child, as nature de&s;igned him to be.</P>
<P>This unfortunate youth was never per|mitted to have one conception of his own&mdash;all was taught him&mdash;he was never once a&s;ked "what he thought?" but men were paid to tell him "how to think." He was taught to revere &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, however unworthy of his rever|ence; to believe &s;uch and &s;uch things, however unworthy of his credit; and to act &s;o and &s;o, on &s;uch and &s;uch occa&s;ions, however unworthy of his feelings.</P>
<P>Such were the le&s;&s;ons of the tutors a&s;|&s;igned him by his father&mdash;Tho&s;e ma&s;ters whom his mother gave him, did him le&s;s mi&s;chief; for though they di&s;torted his limbs and made his manners effeminate, they did not interfere with the internal.</P>
<P>Mr. Norwynne (the family name of his father, and though but a &s;choolboy, he was called <HI>Mi&s;ter</HI>) could talk on hi&s;tory, on politics, and on religion; &s;urpri&s;ingly to all who never li&s;tened to a parrot or a
<PB N="35" REF="34">
magpie&mdash;for he merely repeated what he had heard, without one reflection upon the &s;en&s;e or probability of his report. He had been prai&s;ed for his memory, and to continue that prai&s;e, he was &s;o anxious to retain every &s;entence he had heard or he had read, that the poor creature had no time for one native idea, but only re|delivered his tutors' le&s;&s;ons to his father, and his father's to his tutors. But, what|ever he &s;aid or did, was the admiration of all who came to the hou&s;e of the dean, and who knew he was an only child&mdash;Indeed, con&s;idering the labour that was taken to &s;poil him, he was rather a com|mendable youth; for, with the pedantic folly of his tutors, the blind affection of his father and mother, the ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s of the &s;ervants, and flattery of the vi&s;itors, it was &s;ome credit to him that he was not an ideot, or a brute&mdash;Though when he imitated the manners of a man, he had &s;omething of the latter in his ap|pearance&mdash;for he would grin and bow to a lady, catch her fan in ha&s;te if it fell, and hand her to her coach, as thoroughly void of all the &s;entiment, which gives grace to &s;uch tricks, as a monkey.</P>

<P>ONE morning in winter, ju&s;t as the dean, his wife, and darling child, had fini&s;hed their breakfa&s;t at their hou&s;e in London, a &s;ervant brought in a letter to his ma&s;ter, and &s;aid "The man waited for an an&s;wer."</P>
<P>"Who is the man?" cried the dean, with all that terrifying dignity, with which he never failed to addre&s;s his inferiors, e&s;pecially &s;uch as waited on his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant replied with a &s;ervility of tone equal to the haughty one of his ma&s;ter "he did not know, but that the man looked like a &s;ailor, and had a boy with him."</P>
<P>"A begging letter no doubt," cried Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>"Take it back," &s;aid the dean, "and bid him &s;end up word who he is, or what is his errand."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant went; and returning &s;aid "He comes from on board a &s;hip, his captain &s;ent him, and his errand is, he

<P>"A boy!" (cried the dean) "what have I to do with a boy? I expect no boy. What boy? What age?"</P>
<P>"He looks about twelve or thirteen," replied the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>"He is mi&s;taken in the hou&s;e," (&s;aid the dean). "Let me look at the letter again."</P>
<P>He did look at it, and &s;aw it was di|rected plainly to him&s;elf&mdash;Upon a &s;econd glance, he had &s;o perfect a recol|lection of the hand as to open it in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly; and after ordering the &s;ervant to withdraw, he read the following.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>ZOCOTORA ISLAND,
<DATE>April 6th.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR BROTHER WILLIAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long time &s;ince we have &s;een one another, but I hope not &s;o long, that you have quite forgotten the many happy days we once pa&s;&s;ed together.</P>
<P>I did not take my leave of you when I left England, becau&s;e it would have been too much for me&mdash;I had met with
<PB N="38" REF="37">
a great many &s;orrows ju&s;t at that time one of which was, the misfortune of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of my right hand by a fall from my hor&s;e, which accident robbed me of mo&s;t of my friends, for I could no longer entertain them with my performance as I u&s;ed to do; and &s;o I was a&s;hamed to &s;ee them or you; and that was the rea&s;on I came hither to try my fortune with &s;ome other ad|venturers.</P>
<P>You have I &s;uppo&s;e heard, how the &s;avages of the i&s;land put our whole party to death except my&s;elf. I was heart-broken for my comrades, but yet upon the whole I do not know that the &s;avages were much to blame&mdash;we had no bu&s;ine&s;s to invade their territories, and if they had invaded England, we &s;hould have done the &s;ame by them.&mdash;My life was &s;pared, becau&s;e, having gained &s;ome little &s;trength in my hand, during the voyage, I plea&s;ed their king, when I arrived there, with playing on my violin.</P>
<P>They &s;pared my child too, in pity to my lamentations, when they were going
<PB N="39" REF="38">
to put him to death.&mdash;Now, dear bro|ther, before I &s;ay any more concern|ing my child to you, I will fir&s;t a&s;k your pardon for any offence I may have ever given you in all the time we lived &s;o long together&mdash;I know you have often found fault with me, and I dare &s;ay I have been to blame very often; but I here &s;olemnly declare that I never did any thing purpo&s;ely to offend you, but mo&s;tly all I could, to oblige you&mdash;and I can &s;afely declare, that I never bore you above a quarter of an hour's re&s;entment, for any thing you might &s;ay to me which I thought har&s;h.</P>
<P>Now, dear William, after being in this i&s;land eleven years, the weakne&s;s in my hand has unfortunately returned, and yet there being no appearance of complaint, the uninformed i&s;landers think it is all my ob&s;tinacy, and that I <HI>will not</HI> entertain them with my mu&s;ic, which makes me &s;ay that I <HI>cannot</HI>; and they have impri&s;oned me, and threaten to put my &s;on to death if I per&s;i&s;t in my &s;tubbornne&s;s any longer.</P>
<P>The angui&s;h I feel in my mind takes away all hope of the recovery of &s;trength
<PB N="40" REF="39">
in my hand, and I have no doubt but that they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into execution.</P>
<P>Therefore, dear brother William, hearing from my pri&s;on of a mo&s;t un|common circum&s;tance, which is that an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el is lying at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from the i&s;land, I have entru&s;ted a faithful negro to take my child to the &s;hip, and deliver him to the captain, with a reque&s;t that he may be &s;ent (with this letter) to you, on the &s;hip's arrival in England.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, dear brother Wil|liam, in ca&s;e the poor boy &s;hould live to come to you, I have no doubt but you will receive him; yet, excu&s;e a poor fond father, if I &s;ay a word or two that I hope may prove in his favour.</P>
<P>Pray, my dear brother, do not think it the child's fault, but mine, that you will find him &s;o ignorant&mdash;he has al|ways &s;hown a quickne&s;s and a willing|ne&s;s to learn, and would, I dare &s;ay, if he had been brought up under your care, have been by this time a Greek
<PB N="41" REF="40">
&s;cholar&mdash;but you know I am no &s;cholar my&s;elf. Be&s;ides, not having any books here, I have only been able to teach my child by talking to him; and in all my conver&s;ations with him, I have never taken much pains to in&s;truct him in the manners of my own country; thinking, that if ever he went over, he would learn them &s;oon enough; and if he never <HI>did</HI> go over, that it would be as well, he knew nothing about them.</P>
<P>I have kept him al&s;o from the know|ledge of every thing which I have thought pernicious in the conduct of the &s;avages, except now and then point|ing out a few of their faults, in order to give him a true conception and a proper di&s;ta&s;te of them. At the &s;ame time I have taught him to love, and to do good to his neighbour, whoever that neighbour might be, and whatever might be his failings. Fal&s;ehood of every kind I included in this precept as forbidden, for no one can love his neighbour and deceive him.</P>
<P>I have in&s;tructed him too, to hold in contempt all frivolous vanity, and
<PB N="42" REF="41">
all kinds of indulgences which he was never likely to obtain. He has learnt all I have undertaken to teach him, but I am afraid you will yet think he has learnt too little.</P>
<P>Your wife, I fear, will be offended at his want of politene&s;s, and perhaps want of proper re&s;pect for a per&s;on of her rank; but indeed he is very trac|table, and can, without &s;everity, be cured of all his faults; and though you will find he has many, yet, pray my dear brother, pray my dear brother William, call to mind he has been a dutiful and an affectionate child to me; and that, had it plea&s;ed heaven we had lived together for many years to come, I verily believe that I &s;hould never have experienced one mark of his di&s;|obedience.</P>
<P>Farewel for ever, my dear dear bro|ther William&mdash;and if my poor, kind, affectionate child &s;hould live to bring you this letter, &s;ometimes &s;peak to him of me; and let him know, that for twelve years he was my &s;ole comfort; and that, when I &s;ent him from me, in
<PB N="43" REF="42">
order to &s;ave his life, I laid down my head upon the floor of the cell in which I was confined, and prayed that heaven might end my days before the morn|ing.</P>

<P>This was the conclu&s;ion of the letter, except four or five lines which (with his name) were &s;o much blotted, apparently with tears, that they were illegible.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the dean was reading to him|&s;elf this letter, his countenance frequently changed, and once or twice the tears &s;treamed from his eyes. When it was fini&s;hed, he exclaimed</P>
<P>"My brother has &s;ent his child to me, and I will be a parent to him." He was going towards the door when Lady Cle|mentina &s;topped him.</P>
<P>"Is it proper, do you think, dean, that all the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e &s;hould be witne&s;&s;es to your meeting with your bro|ther and your nephew in the &s;tate in which they mu&s;t be at pre&s;ent? &s;end for them into a private apartment."</P>
<P>"My brother!" (cried the dean) "Oh! that it <HI>were</HI> my brother! The man is merely a per&s;on from the &s;hip, who has conducted his child hither."</P>
<P>The bell was rung, money was &s;ent to the man, and orders given that the boy &s;hould be &s;hown up immediately.</P>
<P>While young Henry was walking up the &s;tairs, the dean's wife was weighing
<PB N="45" REF="44">
in her mind, in what manner it would mo&s;t redound to her honour to receive him; for her vanity taught her to believe that the whole inqui&s;itive world pried into her conduct even upon every family occurrence.</P>
<P>Young William was wondering to him|&s;elf what kind of an unpoli&s;hed mon&s;ter his beggarly cou&s;in would appear; and was contemplating "how much the poor youth would be &s;urpri&s;ed, and awed by his &s;uperiority."</P>
<P>The dean felt no other &s;en&s;ation than an impatient de&s;ire of beholding the child.</P>
<P>The door opened&mdash;and the &s;on of his brother Henry, of his benefactor, entered.</P>
<P>The habit he had on when he left his father, being worn out by the length of the voyage, he was in the dre&s;s of a &s;ailor-boy. Though about the &s;ame age with his cou&s;in, he was &s;omething taller: and though a &s;trong family re&s;emblance appeared between the two youths, he was hand&s;omer than William; and from a &s;implicity &s;pread over his countenance, a quick impatience in his eye, which de|noted
<PB N="46" REF="45">
anxious curio&s;ity, and childi&s;h &s;ur|pri&s;e at every new object which pre&s;ented it&s;elf, he appeared younger than his in|formed, and well-bred cou&s;in.</P>
<P>He walked into the room, not with a dictated obei&s;ance, but with a hurrying &s;tep, a half plea&s;ed, yet a half frightened look, an in&s;tantaneous &s;urvey of every per&s;on pre&s;ent; not as demanding "what they thought of him," but expre&s;&s;ing, almo&s;t as plainly as in direct words, "what he thought of them." For all alarm in re&s;pect to his &s;afety and recep|tion &s;eemed now wholly forgotten in the curio&s;ity which the &s;udden fight of &s;tran|gers, &s;uch as he had never &s;een in his life before, excited. And as to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he did not appear to know there was &s;uch a per&s;on exi&s;ting: his whole faculties were ab&s;orbed in <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>The dean's reception of him did ho|nour to his &s;en&s;ibility; and his gratitude to his brother.&mdash;After the fir&s;t affectionate gaze, he ran to him, took him in his arms, &s;at down, drew him to him, held him between his knees, and repeatedly exclaimed, "I will repay to you, all I owe to your father."</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">The boy, in return, hugged the dean round the neck, ki&s;&s;ed him, and cried,</P>
<P>"Oh you <HI>are</HI> my father&mdash;you have ju&s;t &s;uch eyes, and &s;uch a forehead&mdash;in|deed you would be almo&s;t the &s;ame as he, if it were not for that great white thing which grows upon your head!"</P>
<P>Let the reader under&s;tand, that the dean, fondly attached to every ornament of his dignified function, was never &s;een (unle&s;s caught in bed) without an enor|mous wig&mdash;with this, young Henry was enormou&s;ly &s;truck; having never &s;een &s;o unbecoming a decoration, either in the &s;avage i&s;land from whence he came, or on board of the ve&s;&s;el in which he &s;ailed.</P>
<P>"Do you imagine" (cried his uncle, laying his hand gently on the reverend habiliment) "that this grows?"</P>
<P>"What is on <HI>my</HI> head grows," &s;aid young Henry, "and &s;o does what is upon my father's."</P>
<P>"But now you are come to Europe, you will &s;ee many per&s;ons with &s;uch things as the&s;e, which they put on and take off."</P>
<P>"Why do you wear &s;uch things?"</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">"As a di&s;tinction between us and in|ferior people: they are worn to give an importance to the wearer."</P>
<P>"That is ju&s;t as the &s;avages do; they &s;tick bra&s;s nails, wire, buttons, and en|trails of bea&s;ts all over them to give them importance."</P>
<P>The dean now led his nephew to Lady Clementina, and told him "That was his aunt, to whom he mu&s;t behave with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect."</P>
<P>"I will, I will," he replied, "for &s;he, I &s;ee, is a per&s;on of importance too&mdash;&s;he has, very near, &s;uch a white thing upon her head as you have!"</P>
<P>His aunt had not yet fixed, in what manner it was be&s;t to behave; whether with intimidating grandeur, or with amiable tenderne&s;s. While &s;he was he|&s;itating between the two, &s;he felt a kind of jealous apprehen&s;ion that her &s;on was not &s;o engaging either in his per&s;on or addre&s;s as his cou&s;in; and therefore &s;he &s;aid</P>
<P>"I hope, dean, the arrival of this child will give you a &s;till higher &s;en&s;e of the happine&s;s we enjoy in our own&mdash;what
<PB N="49" REF="48">
an in&s;tructive contra&s;t between the man|ners of the one, and of the other!"</P>
<P>"It is not the child's fault," returned the dean, "that he is not &s;o elegant in his manners as his cou&s;in;&mdash;had William been bred in the &s;ame place, he would have been as unpoli&s;hed as this boy."</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, &s;ir" (&s;aid young William with a formal bow and a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile) "for I a&s;&s;ure you that &s;everal of my tutors have told me, that I appear to know many things by in&s;tinct."</P>
<P>Young Henry fixed his eyes upon his cou&s;in while with &s;teady &s;elf-complacency he delivered this &s;peech; and no &s;ooner was it concluded than Henry cried out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a kind of wonder</P>
<P>"A little man! as I am alive, a little man! I did not know there were &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle men in this country! I never &s;aw one in my life before!"</P>
<P>"This is a boy" (&s;aid the dean) "a boy not older than your&s;elf."</P>
<P>He put their hands together, and Wil|liam gravely &s;hook hands with his cou&s;in.</P>
<P>"It <HI>is</HI> a man," continued young Henry&mdash;then &s;troked his cou&s;in's chin. No no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> do not know whether it is or not."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">"I tell you again," &s;aid the dean, he is a boy of your own age&mdash;you and he are cou&s;ins, for I am his father."</P>
<P>"How can that be?" (&s;aid young Henry) "he called you <HI>Sir.</HI>"</P>
<P>"In this country," &s;aid the dean, po|lite children do not call their parents <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Then don't they &s;ometimes forget to love them as &s;uch?" a&s;ked Henry.</P>
<P>His uncle became now impatient to in|terrogate him in every particular, con|cerning his father's &s;tate&mdash;Lady Clemen|tina felt equal impatience to know where the father was; whether he was coming to live with them, wanted any thing of them, and every circum&s;tance in which her vanity was intere&s;ted.

<P>THAT vanity which pre&s;ided over every thought and deed of Lady Cle|mentina's, was the protector of young Henry within her hou&s;e: it repre&s;ented to her "how amiable her conduct would appear in the eye of the world, &s;hould &s;he conde&s;cend to treat this de&s;titute nephew as her own &s;on:" it repre&s;ented to her "the envy &s;uch heroic virtue would excite in the hearts of her parti|cular friends, and what grief in the bo&s;om of all tho&s;e who did not like her."</P>
<P>The dean was a man of acute penetra|tion; he under&s;tood the thoughts which upon this occa&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of his wife; and in order to in&s;ure her kind treatment of the boy, in&s;tead of reproach|ing her for the cold manner in which &s;he had at fir&s;t received him, he prai&s;ed her tender and &s;ympathetic heart for having &s;hown him &s;o much kindne&s;s: and thus &s;timulated her vanity to be prai&s;ed &s;till more.</P>
<P>William, the mother's own &s;on, far from apprehending a rival in this &s;avage
<PB N="52" REF="51">
boy, was convinced of his own pre-emi|nence, and felt an affection for him; though rather as a foil, than as a cou&s;in. He &s;ported with his ignorance upon all occa&s;ions, and even lay in wait for cir|cum&s;tances that might expo&s;e it: while young Henry, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with every thing that appeared new to him, expre&s;&s;ed, without re&s;erve, the &s;en&s;ations which tho&s;e novelties excited; and felt little care what con&s;truction was put upon his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>He never appeared offended, or a ba&s;h|ed when laughed at, but &s;till pur&s;ued his que&s;tions, and &s;till di&s;covered his wonder at many replies made to him, though "&s;impleton," "poor filly boy," and "ideot," were vociferated around him from his cou&s;in, his aunt, and their con|&s;tant vi&s;itor the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>His uncle would frequently undertake to in&s;truct him; &s;o indeed would the bi&s;hop; but Lady Clementina, her &s;on, and the greate&s;t part of her companions, found &s;omething &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly ridiculous in his remarks, that nothing but immo|derate laughter followed: they thought &s;uch folly had even merit in the way of
<PB N="53" REF="52">
entertainment, and they wi&s;hed him no wi&s;er.</P>
<P>Having been told, that every morning on fir&s;t &s;eeing his uncle he was to make a re&s;pectful bow, and coming into the dean's dre&s;&s;ing room ju&s;t as he was out of bed, his wig lying on the table, Henry appeared at a lo&s;s which of the two he &s;hould bow to&mdash;at la&s;t he gave the pre|ference to his uncle; but afterwards, bowed reverently to the wig. In this, he did what he conceived was proper, from the introduction which the dean, on his fir&s;t arrival, had given him to this vener|able &s;tranger; for in reality, Henry had a contempt for all finery; and had called even his aunt's jewels, when they were fir&s;t &s;hown to him, "trumpery," a&s;king "what they were good for?" But being corrected in this di&s;re&s;pect, and informed of their high value, he, like a good con|vert, gave up his rea&s;on to his faith: and becoming, like all converts, over zealous, he now believed there was great worth in glittering appearances, and re&s;pected the ear-rings of Lady Clementina almo&s;t as much as he re&s;pected her.</P>

<P>IT was to be lamented, that when young Henry had been &s;everal months in Eng|land, had been taught to read, and had of cour&s;e, in the &s;ociety in which he lived, &s;een much of the enlightened world, yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no means an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;en&s;ibility, which upon various occa&s;ions he manife&s;ted in the mo&s;t captivating degree, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;eeming gentlene&s;s of his nature upon all occa&s;ions, there now ap|peared in mo&s;t of his enquiries and re|marks, a &s;omething which demon&s;trated either a &s;tupid, or trouble&s;ome di&s;po&s;ition; either dulne&s;s of conception, or an ob|&s;tinacy of per&s;everance in comments and in arguments that were glaringly fal&s;e.</P>

<P>"You &s;hall never drive me again."</P>
<P>The dean at la&s;t a&s;ked "what he meant by thus repeating his words?"</P>
<P>"I am trying to find out what <HI>you</HI> meant," &s;aid Henry.</P>
<P>"What! do not you know," cried his enlightened cou&s;in, "Richard is turned away?&mdash;he is never to get upon our coach-box again, never to drive any of us any more."</P>
<P>"And was it plea&s;ure to drive us, cou&s;in?&mdash;I am &s;ure I have often pitied him&mdash;it rained &s;ometimes very hard when he was on the box&mdash;and &s;ometimes Lady Clementina has kept him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and &s;now&mdash;was that plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"No," replied young William.</P>
<P>"Was it honour, cou&s;in?"</P>
<P>"No," exclaimed his cou&s;in with a contemptuous &s;mile.</P>

<P>"And what are the rich born for?"</P>
<P>"To be &s;erved by the poor."</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e the poor would not &s;erve them?"</P>
<P>"Then they mu&s;t &s;tarve."</P>

<P>"I heard my father once &s;ay &s;omething about a world to come; but he &s;topt &s;hort, and &s;aid I was too young to under|&s;tand what he meant."</P>

<P>"How! has God ordained a di&s;tinc|tion to be made, and will not make any him&s;elf?"</P>

<P>IN addition to his ignorant conver&s;ation upon many topics, young Henry had an incorrigible mi&s;conception and mi&s;appli|cation of many <HI>words</HI>&mdash;his father having had but few opportunities of di&s;cour&s;ing with him upon account of his attendance at the court of the &s;avages; and not hav|ing books in the i&s;land, he had con|&s;equently many words to learn of this country's language when he arrived in England: this ta&s;k his retentive memory made ea&s;y to him; but his childi&s;h inat|tention to their proper &s;ignification &s;till made his want of education con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>He would call <HI>compliments, lies&mdash;Re|&s;erve,</HI> he would call <HI>pride&mdash;&s;tateline&s;s, af|fectation</HI>&mdash;and for the mono&s;yllable <HI>war,</HI> he con&s;tantly &s;ub&s;tituted the word <HI>ma&s;|&s;acre.</HI></P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid William, to his father one morning as he entered the room, "do you hear how the cannons are firing, and the bells ringing?"</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">"Then I dare &s;ay," cried Henry, "there has been another ma&s;&s;acre."</P>
<P>The dean called to him in anger "Will you never learn the right u&s;e of words? You mean to &s;ay a battle."</P>
<P>"Then what is a ma&s;&s;acre?" cried the frightened, but &s;till curious Henry.</P>
<P>"A ma&s;&s;acre" replied his uncle, "is when a number of people are &s;lain&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I thought," returned Henry, "&s;ol|diers had been people!"</P>
<P>"You interrupt me," &s;aid the dean, "before I fini&s;hed my &s;entence&mdash;cer|tainly, both &s;oldiers and &s;ailors are peo|ple, but they engage to die by their own free will and con&s;ent."</P>
<P>"What! all of them?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t of them."</P>
<P>"But the re&s;t are ma&s;&s;acred?"</P>
<P>The dean an&s;wered "The number that go to battle unwillingly, and by force, are few; and for the others, they have previou&s;ly &s;old their lives to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>"For what?"</P>
<P>"For &s;oldiers' and &s;ailors' pay."</P>
<P>"My father u&s;ed to tell me, we mu&s;t not take away our own lives; but he
<PB N="60" REF="59">
forgot to tell me, we might &s;ell them for others to take away."</P>
<P>"William," (&s;aid the dean to his &s;on, his patience tired with his nephew's per|&s;evering non&s;en&s;e) "explain to your cou&s;in the difference between a battle and a ma&s;&s;acre."</P>
<P>"A ma&s;&s;acre," &s;aid William, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, and fixing his eyes alter|nately upon his father, his mother, and the bi&s;hop (all of whom were pre&s;ent) for their approbation, rather than the per|&s;on's to whom his in&s;tructions were to be addre&s;&s;ed&mdash;"a ma&s;&s;acre," &s;aid William, "is when human beings are &s;lain, who have it not in their power to defend them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"Dear cou&s;in William," (&s;aid Henry) "that mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e, with every one who is killed."</P>
<P>After a &s;hort he&s;itation, William re|plied, "In ma&s;&s;acres people are put to death for no crime, but merely becau&s;e they are objects of &s;u&s;picion."</P>
<P>"But in battle," &s;aid Henry, "the per&s;ons put to death, are not even &s;u&s;|pected."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60">The bi&s;hop now conde&s;cended to end this di&s;putation by &s;aying emphatically</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider; young &s;avage, that in battle neither the infant, the aged, the &s;ick or infirm are involved, but only tho&s;e in the full prime of health and vigour."</P>
<P>As this argument came from &s;o great and reverend a man as the bi&s;hop, Henry was obliged, by a frown from his uncle, to &s;ubmit, as one refuted; although he had an an&s;wer at the verie&s;t tip of his tongue, which it was torture to him not to utter. What he wi&s;hed to &s;ay mu&s;t ever remain a &s;ecret.

<P>IF the dean had loved his wife but mo|derately, &s;eeing all her faults clearly as he did, he mu&s;t frequently have quar|relled with her: if he had loved her with tenderne&s;s, he mu&s;t have treated her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her failings: but having nei|ther per&s;onal, nor mental affection towards her &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to give him&s;elf the trouble to contradict her will in any thing, he pa&s;&s;ed for one of the be&s;t hu&s;|bands in the world. Lady Clementina went out when &s;he liked, &s;taid at home when &s;he liked, dre&s;&s;ed as &s;he liked, and talked as &s;he liked, without a word of di&s;approbation from her hu&s;band, and all&mdash;becau&s;e he cared nothing about her.</P>
<P>Her vanity attributed this indulgence to inordinate affection: and ob&s;ervers in general thought her happier in her mar|riage, than the beloved wife who bathes her pillow with her tears by the &s;ide of an angry hu&s;band, who&s;e affection is &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive,
<PB N="63" REF="62">
that he unkindly upbraids her becau&s;e &s;he is&mdash;le&s;s than perfection.</P>
<P>The dean's wife was not &s;o di&s;pa&s;&s;ion|ately con&s;idered by &s;ome of his acquaint|ance as by him&s;elf; for they would now and then hint at her foibles; but this great liberty &s;he al&s;o conceived to be the effect of mo&s;t violent love, or mo&s;t vio|lent admiration; and &s;uch would have been her con&s;truction had they com|mended her follies&mdash;had they totally &s;lighted, or had they beaten her.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e acquaintances, the Bi|&s;hop of ****, by far the mo&s;t frequent vi&s;itor, did not come merely to lounge an idle hour, but he had a more power|ful motive; the de&s;ire of fame, and dread of being thought a man receiving large emolument for unimportant &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The dean, if he did not procure him the renown he wi&s;hed, &s;till pre&s;erved him from the apprehended cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The elder William was to his negligent or ignorant &s;uperiors in the church, &s;uch as an apt boy at &s;chool is to the rich dunces&mdash;William performed the prelates' ta&s;ks for them, and they rewarded him&mdash;
<PB N="64" REF="63">
not indeed with toys or money, but with their countenance, their company, their prai&s;e.&mdash;And &s;carcely was there a &s;ermon preached from the patrician part of the bench, that the dean did not fa&s;hion &s;ome periods, blot out &s;ome uncouth phra&s;es, render &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;entiments intel|ligible, and was the certain per&s;on, when the work was printed, to correct the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Honourable and Right Reverend Bi&s;hop of **** delighted in printing and publi&s;hing his works; or rather the entire works of the dean, which pa&s;&s;ed for his&mdash;and &s;o degradingly did William, the &s;hopkeeper's &s;on, think of his own hone&s;t extraction, that he was blinded, even to the lo&s;s of honour, by the lu&s;tre of this noble acquaintance: for though, in other re&s;pects, a man of integrity, yet, when the gratification of his friend was the con|cern, he was a liar; he not only di&s;|owned his giving him aid in any of his publications, but he never publi&s;hed any thing in his own name, without declaring to the world "That he had been obliged for all the hints on the &s;ubject, for many of the mo&s;t judicious corrections, and for
<PB N="65" REF="64">
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in page &s;o and &s;o (naming the mo&s;t eloquent part of the work) to his noble and learned friend the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The dean's wife being a fine lady&mdash;while her hu&s;band and his friend pored over books or their own manu&s;cripts at home, &s;he ran from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, from public amu&s;ement to public amu&s;ement, but much le&s;s for the plea&s;ure of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> than for that of being <HI>&s;een.</HI> Nor was it material to her enjoyment whether &s;he was ob&s;erved, or welcome where &s;he went, as &s;he never entertained the &s;malle&s;t doubt of either; but re&s;ted a&s;&s;ured that her pre|&s;ence rou&s;ed curio&s;ity and di&s;pen&s;ed glad|ne&s;s all around.</P>
<P>One morning &s;he went forth to pay he vi&s;its, all &s;miles, &s;uch as &s;he thought cap|tivating: &s;he returned, all tears, &s;uch as &s;he thought no le&s;s endearing.</P>
<P>Three ladies accompanied her home, entreating her to be patient under a mi&s;|fortune to which even kings are liable, namely, defamation.</P>
<P>Young Henry, &s;truck with compa&s;&s;ion at grief, of which he knew not yet the cau&s;e, begged to know "What was the matter?"</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="65">"Inhuman mon&s;ters, to treat a woman thus!" cried his aunt in fury&mdash;ca&s;ting the corner of her eye into a looking-gla&s;s to &s;ee how rage became her.</P>
<P>"But, comfort your&s;elf" (&s;aid one of her companions) "few people will be|lieve you merit the charge."</P>
<P>"But few! if only one believe it, I &s;hall call my reputation lo&s;t, and I will &s;hut my&s;elf in &s;ome lonely hut, and give up all that is dear to me for ever!"</P>

<P>"Of what importance will my be&s;t dreffes be, when nobody would &s;ee them?"</P>
<P>"You would &s;ee them your&s;elf, dear aunt, and I am &s;ure nobody admires them more."</P>
<P>"Now you &s;peak of that," &s;aid &s;he, "I do not think this gown I have on be|coming&mdash;I am &s;ure I look&mdash;"</P>
<P>The dean, with the bi&s;hop (to whom he had been reading a treati&s;e ju&s;t going to the pre&s;s, which was to be publi&s;hed in the name of the latter, though written by the former) now entered, to enquire why they had been &s;ent for in &s;uch ha&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66">"Oh dean! Oh my lord!" &s;he cried, re&s;uming that grief which the thoughts of her dre&s;s had for a time di&s;pelled&mdash;" My reputation is de&s;troyed&mdash;a public print has accu&s;ed me of playing deep at my own hou&s;e, and winning all the money."</P>
<P>"The world will never reform," &s;aid the bi&s;hop: "all our labour, my friend, is thrown away."</P>
<P>"But is it po&s;&s;ible," cried the dean, "that any one has dared to &s;ay this of you?"</P>
<P>"Here it is in print." Said &s;he, hold|ing out a new&s;paper.</P>
<P>The dean read the paragraph, and then exclaimed "I can forgive a fal&s;ehood <HI>&s;poken</HI>&mdash;the warmth of conver&s;ation may excu&s;e it&mdash;but to <HI>write</HI> and <HI>print</HI> an un|truth is unpardonable&mdash;and I will pro|&s;ecute this publi&s;her."</P>
<P>"Still the fal&s;ehood will go down to po&s;terity," (&s;aid Lady Clementina) "and after ages will think I was a gambler."</P>
<P>"Comfort your&s;elf, dear madam," &s;aid young Henry, wi&s;hing to con&s;ole her, "perhaps after ages may not hear of you; nor even the pre&s;ent age think much about you."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">The bi&s;hop now exclaimed, after hav|ing taken the paper from the dean and read the paragraph, "It is a libel, a rank libel, and the author mu&s;t be puni&s;hed."</P>
<P>"Not only the author but the pub|li&s;her." Said the dean.</P>
<P>"Not only the publi&s;her, but the printer." Continued the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>"And mu&s;t my name be bandied about by lawyers in a common court of ju&s;tice?" cried Lady Clementina: "How &s;hocking to my delicacy!"</P>
<P>"My lord, it is a pity we cannot try them by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court." Said the dean, with a &s;igh!</P>
<P>"Nor by the India delinquent bill," &s;aid the bi&s;hop with vexation.</P>
<P>"So totally innocent as I am!" &s;he vociferated with &s;obs. "Every one knows I never touch a card at home, and this libel charges me with playing at my own hou&s;e&mdash;and though, whenever I do play, I own I am apt to win, yet it is merely for my amu&s;ement."</P>
<P>"Win or not win, play or not play," exclaimed both the church-men, "this is a libel: no doubt, no doubt, a libel."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">Poor Henry's confined knowledge of his native language tormented him &s;o much with curio&s;ity upon this occa&s;ion, that he went &s;oftly up to his uncle, and a&s;ked him in a whi&s;per, "What was the meaning of the word libel?"</P>
<P>"A libel," replied the dean, in a rai&s;ed voice, "is that, which one per&s;on pub|li&s;hes to the injury of another."</P>
<P>"And what can the injured per&s;on do" (a&s;ked Henry) "if the accu&s;ation &s;hould chance to be true?"</P>
<P>"Pro&s;ecute." Replied the dean.</P>
<P>"But then, what does he do if the ac|cu&s;ation is fal&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Pro&s;ecute likewi&s;e." An&s;wered the dean.</P>
<P>"How, uncle! is it po&s;&s;ible that the innocent behave ju&s;t like the guilty?"</P>
<P>"There is no other way to act."</P>
<P>"Why then, if I was the innocent, I would do nothing at all, &s;ooner than I would act like the guilty. I would not per&s;ecute&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I &s;aid <HI>pro&s;ecute.</HI>" (Cried the dean in anger) "Leave the room, you have no comprehen&s;ion."</P>

<P>"After this modern &s;tar-chamber, which was left &s;itting, had agreed on its mode of vengeance, and the writer of the libel was made acquainted with his danger, he waited, in all humility, upon Lady Clementina, and a&s;&s;ured her, with every appearance of &s;incerity&mdash;</P>

<P>ABOUT this period the dean had ju&s;t publi&s;hed a pamphlet in his own name, and in which that of his friend the bi&s;hop was only mentioned with thanks for hints, ob&s;ervations, and con|de&s;cending encouragement to the author.</P>
<P>This pamphlet glowed with the dean's love for his country; and &s;uch a country as he de&s;cribed, it was impo&s;&s;ible <HI>not</HI> to love. "Salubrious air, fertile fields, wood, water, corn, gra&s;s, &s;heep, oxen, fi&s;h, fowl, fruit, and vegetables," were di&s;per&s;ed with the mo&s;t prodigal hand&mdash;"valiant men, pretty women; &s;tate&s;men wi&s;e and ju&s;t; trade&s;men abounding in merchandi&s;e and money; hu&s;bandmen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing peace, ea&s;e, plenty: and all ranks, liberty."&mdash;This brilliant de&s;crip|tion, while the dean read the work to his family, &s;o charmed poor Henry that he repeatedly cried out</P>
<P>"I am glad I came to this country."</P>
<P>But it &s;o happened that a few days after, Lady Clementina, in order to render
<PB N="73" REF="72">
the delicacy of her ta&s;te admired, could eat of no one di&s;h upon the table, but found fault with them all. The dean at length &s;aid to her,</P>
<P>"Indeed you are too nice&mdash;reflect upon the hundreds of poor creatures who have not a mor&s;el, or a drop of any thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, except bread and water; and even of the fir&s;t a &s;canty allowance, but for which they are obliged to toil &s;ix days in the week, from &s;un to &s;un."</P>
<P>"Pray, uncle," cried Henry, "in what country do the&s;e poor people live?"</P>
<P>"In this country." Replied the dean.</P>
<P>Henry ro&s;e from his chair, ran to the chimney-piece, took up his uncle's pam|phlet, and &s;aid, "I don't remember your mentioning them here."</P>
<P>"Perhaps I have not." An&s;wered the dean coolly.</P>
<P>Still Henry turned over each leaf of the book, but he could meet only with luxurious details of "the fruits of the earth, the bea&s;ts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea."</P>
<P>"Why here is provi&s;ion enough for all the people," &s;aid Henry: "why &s;hould
<PB N="74" REF="73">
they want? why do not they go and take &s;ome of the&s;e things?"</P>
<P>"They mu&s;t not," &s;aid the dean, "unle&s;s they were their own."</P>
<P>"What! uncle, does no part of the earth, nor any thing which the earth pro|duces, belong to the poor?"</P>
<P>"Certainly not."</P>
<P>"Why did not you &s;ay &s;o then in your pamphlet?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e it is what every body knows."</P>
<P>"Oh, then, what you have &s;aid in your pamphlet, is only what&mdash;nobody knows."</P>
<P>There appeared to the dean, in the delivery of this &s;entence, a &s;atirical acri|mony, which his irritability as an author could but ill forgive.</P>
<P>An author, it is &s;aid, has more acute feelings in re&s;pect to his works, than any arti&s;t in the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;ome cau&s;e, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to think this ob&s;ervation ju&s;t; for no &s;ooner had he &s;poken the foregoing words, than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room; and leading him to his &s;tudy, there he enumerated his va|rious faults, and having told him "it was
<PB N="75" REF="74">
for all tho&s;e, too long permitted with im|punity, and not merely for the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> im|pertinence, that he meant to puni&s;h him," ordered him to clo&s;e confinement in his chamber for a week.</P>
<P>In the mean time the dean's pamphlet (le&s;s hurt by Henry's critique than <HI>he</HI> had been) was proceeding to the tenth edition, and the author acquiring literary repu|tation beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle, the energy, the eloquence of the work, was echoed by every reader who could afford to buy it&mdash;&s;ome few en|lightened ones excepted, who chiefly ad|mired the author's <HI>invention.</HI></P>

<P>THE dean, in the good humour which the rapid &s;ale of his book produced, once more took his nephew to his bo&s;om; and although the ignorance of young Henry upon the late occa&s;ions, had offended him very highly, yet that &s;elf-&s;ame ignorance, evinced a &s;hort time after upon a different &s;ubject, &s;truck his uncle, as productive of a mo&s;t rare and exalted virtue.</P>
<P>Henry had frequently in his conver|&s;ation betrayed the total want of all knowledge in re&s;pect to religion or fu|turity; and the dean for this rea&s;on de|layed taking him to church, till he had previou&s;ly given him in&s;tructions <HI>where|fore</HI> he went.</P>
<P>A lei&s;ure morning arrived on which he took his nephew to his &s;tudy, and implanted in his youthful mind, the fir&s;t unconfu&s;ed idea, of the Creator of the univer&s;e!</P>
<P>The dean was eloquent, Henry was all attention: his under&s;tanding, expanded
<PB N="77" REF="76">
by time, to the conception of a God&mdash;and not warped by cu&s;tom, from the &s;en|&s;ations which a ju&s;t notion of that God in&s;pires, dwelt with delight and wonder on the information given him!&mdash;le&s;&s;ons, which in&s;tilled into the head of a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s infant, too often produce throughout his remaining life, an impious indiffer|ence to the truths revealed.</P>
<P>Yet, with all that a&s;toni&s;hed, that re|&s;pectful &s;en&s;ibility which Henry &s;howed on this great occa&s;ion; he &s;till expre&s;&s;ed his opinion, and put que&s;tions to the dean with his u&s;ual &s;implicity, till he felt him|&s;elf convinced.</P>
<P>"What!" cried he&mdash;after being in|formed of the attributes in&s;eparable from the Supreme Being, and having received the injunction to offer prayers to him night and morning, "What! am I per|mitted to &s;peak to power divine?"</P>
<P>"At all times." Replied the dean.</P>
<P>"What! whenever I like?"</P>
<P>"Whenever you like." Returned the dean.</P>
<P>"I dur&s;t not" (cried Henry) "make &s;o free with the bi&s;hop: nor dare any of his attendants."</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77">"The bi&s;hop" (&s;aid the dean) "is the &s;ervant of God, and therefore mu&s;t be treated with re&s;pect."</P>
<P>"With more re&s;pect than his ma&s;ter?" a&s;ked Henry.</P>
<P>The dean not replying immediately to this que&s;tion, Henry in the rapidity of enquiry ran to another: "But what am I to &s;ay, when I &s;peak to the Almighty?"</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, thank him for the favours he has be&s;towed on you."</P>
<P>"What favours?"</P>
<P>"You amaze me" (cried the dean) "by your que&s;tion! Do not you live in ea&s;e, in plenty, and happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>"And do the poor, and the unhappy, thank him too, uncle?"</P>
<P>"No doubt&mdash;every human being glo|rifies him, for having been made a ra|tional creature."</P>
<P>"And does my aunt and all her card parties glorify him for that?"</P>
<P>The dean again made no reply&mdash;and Henry went on to other que&s;tions, till his uncle had fully in&s;tructed him as to the nature and the form of <HI>prayer</HI>&mdash;and now putting into his hands a book, he pointed
<PB N="79" REF="78">
out to him a few &s;hort prayers which he wi&s;hed him to addre&s;s to heaven in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Henry bent his knees, as his uncle had directed, he trembled&mdash;turned pale&mdash;and held for a &s;light &s;upport, on the chair placed before him.</P>
<P>His uncle went to him and a&s;ked him, "What was the matter?"</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried Henry, "when I fir&s;t came to your door with my poor father's letter, I &s;hook for fear you would not look upon me&mdash;and I cannot help feeling, even more now, than I did then."</P>
<P>The dean embraced him with warmth&mdash;gave him confidence&mdash;and retired to the other &s;ide of the &s;tudy to ob&s;erve his whole demeanour on this new occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As he beheld his features varying be|tween the pa&s;&s;ions of humble fear, and &s;ervent hope,&mdash;his face &s;ometimes glow|ing with the rapture of thank&s;giving, and &s;ometimes with the blu&s;hes of contrition, he thus exclaimed apart:</P>
<P>"This is the true education on which to found the principles of religion&mdash;The favour conferred by heaven in granting
<PB N="80" REF="79">
the freedom of petitions to its throne, can never be conceived with proper force, but by tho&s;e, who&s;e mo&s;t tedious mo|ments during their infancy, were <HI>not</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in prayer. Unthinking governors of childhood! to in&s;ult the Deity with a form of wor&s;hip, in which the mind has no &s;hare; nay wor&s;e, has repugnance; and by the thoughtle&s;s habits of youth, prevent, even in age, devotion.</P>
<P>Henry's attention was &s;o firmly fixed, that he forgot there was a &s;pectator of his fervour; nor did he hear young William enter the chamber and even &s;peak to his father.</P>
<P>At length clo&s;ing his book, and ri&s;ing from his knees, he approached his uncle and cou&s;in with a &s;edatene&s;s in his air, which gave the latter a very fal&s;e opinion of the &s;tate of his youthful companion's mind.</P>
<P>"So, Mr. Henry," cried William, "you have been obliged to &s;ay your prayers at la&s;t."</P>
<P>The dean informed his &s;on, "That to Henry, it was no puni&s;hment to pray."</P>
<P>"He is the &s;trange&s;t boy I ever knew." Said William inadvertently.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">"To be &s;ure," &s;aid Henry, "I was frightened when I fir&s;t knelt; but when I came to the words <HI>Father which art in heaven,</HI> they gave me courage; for I know how merciful and kind a <HI>father</HI> is, beyond any one el&s;e."</P>
<P>The dean again embraced his nephew; let fall a tear to his poor brother Henry's misfortunes; and admoni&s;hed the youth to &s;how him&s;elf equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to other in&s;tructions, as he had done to tho&s;e, which inculcate piety.</P>

<P>THE interim between youth and man|hood was pa&s;&s;ed by young William and young Henry in &s;tudious application to literature; &s;ome ca&s;ual mi&s;takes in our cu&s;toms and manners on the part of Henry, &s;ome too clo&s;e adherences to them on the &s;ide of William.</P>
<P>Their different characters when boys, were pre&s;erved when they were men: Henry &s;till retained that natural &s;implicity which his early de&s;tiny had given him; he wondered &s;till at many things he &s;aw and heard, and at times would venture to give his opinion, contradict, and even act in oppo&s;ition to per&s;ons, whom long experience and the approbation of the world had placed in &s;ituations that claim|ed his implicit reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Unchanged in all his boyi&s;h graces, young William, now a man, was never known to infringe upon the &s;tatutes of good-breeding, even though &s;incerity, his own free will, duty to his neighbour,
<PB N="83" REF="82">
with many other plebeian virtues and privileges, were the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>William inherited all the pride and ambition of the dean&mdash;Henry, all his father's humility. And yet (&s;o various and exten&s;ive is the acceptation of the word pride, that) on &s;ome occa&s;ions, Henry was proud even beyond his cou&s;in. He thought it far beneath his dignity, ever to honour or contemplate with awe, any human being in whom he &s;aw nu|merous failings. Nor would he, to in|gratiate him&s;elf into the favour of a man above him, &s;toop to one &s;ervility, &s;uch as the haughty William daily practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I know I am called proud." One day &s;aid William to Henry.</P>
<P>"Dear cou&s;in," replied Henry, "it mu&s;t be only then, by tho&s;e who do not know you: for to me you appear the humble&s;t creature in the world."</P>
<P>"Do you really think &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I am certain of it; or would you al|ways give up your opinion to that of per|&s;ons in a &s;uperior &s;tate, however inferior in their under&s;tanding? Would, el&s;e, their weak judgment immediately change
<PB N="84" REF="83">
yours, though, before, you had been de|cided on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide? Now indeed, cou&s;in, I have more pride than you, for I never will &s;toop to act or to &s;peak con|trary to my feelings.</P>
<P>"Then you will never be a great man."</P>
<P>"Nor ever de&s;ire it, if I mu&s;t fir&s;t be a mean one."</P>
<P>There was in the reputation of the&s;e two young men another mi&s;take, which the common retailers of character com|mitted. Henry was &s;aid to be wholly ne|gligent, while William was reputed to be extremely fond; of the other &s;ex: William indeed was gallant, was amorous, and indulged his inclination to the liber|tine &s;ociety of women; but Henry it was who <HI>loved</HI> them. He admired them at a reverential di&s;tance, and felt &s;o tender an affection for the virtuous part, that it &s;hocked him to behold, much more to a&s;&s;ociate with the depraved and vicious.</P>
<P>In the advantages of per&s;on Henry was &s;till &s;uperior to William, and yet the latter had no common &s;hare of tho&s;e at|tractions which captivate weak, thought|le&s;s, or un&s;kilful minds.</P>

<P>ABOUT the time that Henry and William quitted college and had arrived at their twentieth year, the dean made the purcha&s;e of a &s;mall e&s;tate in a village near to the country re&s;idence of Lord and Lady Bendham; and in the total want of &s;ociety, the dean's family were frequently honoured with invitations from the great hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord Bendham, be&s;ides a good e&s;tate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the office of a lord of the bed-chamber to his maje&s;ty. Hi&s;torians do not a&s;cribe much importance to the &s;itu|ation, or to the talents of nobles in this department, nor &s;hall this little hi&s;tory. A lord of the bed-chamber is a per&s;onage well known in courts, and in all capitals where courts re&s;ide; with this advantage to the inquirer, that in becoming ac|quainted with one of tho&s;e noble cha|racters, you become acquainted with all the remainder; not only with tho&s;e of the &s;ame kingdom, but tho&s;e of foreign
<PB N="86" REF="85">
nations; for, in whatever land, in what|ever climate, a lord of the bed-chamber mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the &s;elf-&s;ame crea|ture: one, wholly made up of ob&s;erv|ance, of obedience, of dependance, and of imitation&mdash;a borrowed character&mdash;a character formed by reflection.</P>
<P>The wife of this illu&s;trious peer, as well as him&s;elf, took her hue, like the chameleon, from &s;urrounding objects; her manners were not governed by her mind, but were &s;olely directed by exter|nal circum&s;tances. At court, humble, re&s;igned, patient, attentive&mdash;At balls, ma&s;querades, gaming-tables, and routs, gay, &s;prightly, and flippant&mdash;At her country &s;eat, re&s;erved, au&s;tere, arrogant, and gloomy.</P>
<P>Though in town her timid eye, in pre|&s;ence of certain per&s;ons, would &s;carce uplift its trembling lid, &s;o much &s;he felt her own in&s;ignificance; yet, in the coun|try, till Lady Clementina arrived, there was not one being of con&s;equence enough to &s;hare in her acquaintance; and &s;he paid back to her inferiors there, all the humiliating &s;lights, and all the mortifica|tions
<PB N="87" REF="86">
which in London &s;he received from tho&s;e to whom <HI>&s;he</HI> was inferior.</P>
<P>Whether in town or country, it is but ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that in her own per&s;on &s;he was &s;trictly cha&s;te; but in the country &s;he extended that cha&s;tity even to the per&s;on of others; and the young woman who lo&s;t her virtue in the village of Anfield, had better have lo&s;t her life. Some few were now and then found hanging or drowned, while no other cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for their de&s;pair, than an imputation on their character, and dread of the har&s;h purity of Lady Bend|ham. She would remind the pari&s;h prie&s;t of the puni&s;hment ordained for female di&s;honour, and by her influence had cau&s;ed many an unhappy girl to do public penance in their own or the neighbour|ing churches.</P>
<P>But this country rigour, in town, &s;he could di&s;pen&s;e withal; and like other ladies of virtue, &s;he there vi&s;ited and re|ceived into her hou&s;e the acknowledged mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of a man in elevated life: it was not therefore the crime, but the rank which the criminal held in &s;ociety, that
<PB N="88" REF="87">
drew down Lady Bendham's vengeance: &s;he even carried her di&s;tinction of cla&s;&s;es in female error to &s;uch a very nice point, that the adulterous concubine of an elder brother was her mo&s;t intimate acquaint|ance, while the le&s;s guilty unmarried mi&s;tre&s;s of the younger, &s;he would not fully her lips to exchange a word with.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady Bendham's birth, edu|cation, talents, and propen&s;ities, being much on the &s;ame &s;cale of eminence, they would have been a very happy pair had not one great misfortune intervened&mdash;The lady never bore her lord a child.&mdash;While every cottage of the village was crammed with half-&s;tarved children, who&s;e father from week to week, from year to year, exerted his manly youth and wa&s;ted his &s;trength in vain to protect them from hunger; who&s;e mother mourned over her new-born infant as a little wretch, &s;ent into the world to deprive the re&s;t of what already was too &s;canty for them; in the ca&s;tle that owned every cottage and all the &s;urrounding land, and where one &s;ingle day of fea&s;ting would have nou|ri&s;hed for a month all the poor inhabit|ants
<PB N="89" REF="88">
of the pari&s;h, not one child was given to partake of the plenty. The cur&s;e of barrenne&s;s was on the family of the lord of the manor&mdash;the cur&s;e of fruit|fulne&s;s upon the fami&s;hed poor.</P>
<P>This lord and lady, with an ample for|tune both by inheritance and their &s;ove|reign's favour, had never yet the oeco|nomy to be exempt from debts; &s;till, over their &s;plendid, their profu&s;e table, they could contrive and plan excellent &s;chemes "how the poor might live mo&s;t comfortably with a little better manage|ment."</P>
<P>The wages of a labouring man with a wife and half a dozen &s;mall children, Lady Bendham thought quite &s;ufficient, if they would only learn a little oeco|nomy.</P>
<P>"You know, my lord, tho&s;e people never want to dre&s;s&mdash;&s;hoes and &s;tockings, a coat and a wai&s;tcoat, a gown and a cap, a petticoat and a handkerchief, is all they want&mdash;fire, to be &s;ure, in winter&mdash;then all the re&s;t is merely for provi&s;ion."</P>
<P>"I'll get a pen and ink," &s;aid young Henry, (one day when he had the honour
<PB N="90" REF="89">
of being at their table) "and &s;ee what the <HI>re&s;t</HI> amounts to."</P>
<P>"No, no accounts," cried my lord, "no &s;umming up: but if you were to calculate, you mu&s;t add to the receipts of the poor my gift at Chri&s;tmas&mdash;La&s;t year, during the fro&s;t, no le&s;s than a hun|dred pounds."</P>
<P>"How benevolent!" Exclaimed the dean.</P>
<P>"How prudent!" Exclaimed Henry.</P>
<P>"What do you mean by prudent?" a&s;ked Lord Bendham. "Explain your meaning."</P>
<P>"No, my lord," replied the dean, "do not a&s;k for an explanation: this youth is wholly unacquainted with our cu&s;toms; and though a man in &s;tature, is but a child in intellects. Henry, have not I often cautioned you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Whatever his thoughts are upon this &s;ubject," cried Lord Bendham, "I de|&s;ire to know them."</P>
<P>"Why then, my lord," an&s;wered Henry, "I thought it was prudent in you to give a little; le&s;t the poor, driven to de&s;pair, &s;hould take all."</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="90">"And if they had they would have been hanged."</P>
<P>"Hanging, my lord, our hi&s;tory, or &s;ome tradition, &s;ays, was formerly adopt|ed as a mild puni&s;hment, in place of &s;tarving."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," cried Lady Bendham, (who &s;eldom &s;poke directly to the argu|ment before her) "I am &s;ure they ought to think them&s;elves much obliged to us."</P>
<P>"That is the greate&s;t hard&s;hip of all." Cried Henry.</P>
<P>"What, &s;ir?" Exclaimed the earl.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon&mdash;my uncle looks di&s;plea&s;ed&mdash;I am very ignorant&mdash;I did not receive my fir&s;t education in this country&mdash;and I find I think &s;o differently from every one el&s;e, that I am a&s;hamed to utter my &s;entiments."</P>
<P>"Never mind, young man," an&s;wered Lord Bendham: "we &s;hall excu&s;e your ignorance for once. Only inform us what it was you ju&s;t now called, <HI>the greate&s;t hard&s;hip of all.</HI>"</P>
<P>"It was, my lord, that what the poor receive to keep them from peri&s;hing, &s;hould pa&s;s under the name of <HI>gifts</HI> and
<PB N="92" REF="91">
<HI>bounty.</HI> Health, &s;trength, and the will to earn a moderate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, ought to be every man's &s;ecurity from obligation."</P>
<P>"I think a hundred pounds a great deal of money," cried Lady Bendham, "and I hope my lord will never give it again."</P>
<P>"And &s;o do I," cried Henry, for if my lord would only be &s;o good as to &s;peak a few words for the poor as a &s;enator, he might po&s;&s;ibly for the future keep his hundred pounds, and yet they never want it."</P>
<P>Lord Bendham had the good nature only to &s;mile at Henry's &s;implicity, whi&s;|pering to him&s;elf, "I had rather keep my&mdash;" His la&s;t word was lo&s;t in the whi&s;per.</P>

<P>IN the country&mdash;where the &s;en&s;ible heart is &s;till more &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;|&s;ions; and where the unfeeling mind, in the want of other wits to invent, forms &s;chemes for its own amu&s;ement&mdash;our youths both fell in love; if pa&s;&s;ions that were pur&s;ued on the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite prin|ciples can receive the &s;ame appellation. William, well ver&s;ed in all the licentious theory, thought him&s;elf in love, becau&s;e he perceived a tumultuous impul&s;e cau&s;e his heart to beat, while his fancy fixed on a certain object, who&s;e pre&s;ence agi|tated yet more his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Henry thought him&s;elf not in love, be|cau&s;e, while he li&s;tened to William on the &s;ubject, he found their &s;en&s;ations did not in the lea&s;t agree.</P>
<P>William owned to Henry, that he loved Hannah, the daughter of a cottager in the village, and hoped to make her his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">Henry felt that his tender regard for Rebecca, the daughter of the curate of the pari&s;h, did not in&s;pire him even with the boldne&s;s to acquaint her with his &s;en|timents, much le&s;s to meditate one de&s;ign that might tend to her di&s;honour.</P>
<P>While William was cautiou&s;ly plan|ning, how to meet in private, and ac|compli&s;h the &s;eduction of the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, Henry was endeavouring to fortify the object of <HI>his</HI> choice with every virtue. He never read a book from which he received improvement, that he did not carry it to Rebecca&mdash;never knew a circum&s;tance that might a&s;&s;i&s;t towards her moral in&s;truction, that he did not ha&s;te to tell it her&mdash;and once, when William boa&s;ted</P>
<P>"He knew he was beloved by Han|nah;"</P>
<P>Henry &s;aid, with equal triumph, "he had not dared to take the means to learn, nor had Rebecca dared to give one in|&s;tance of her partiality."</P>
<P>Rebecca was the younge&s;t, and by far the lea&s;t hand&s;ome daughter of four, to whom the Reverend Mr. Rymer, a
<PB N="95" REF="94">
widower, was father. The other &s;i&s;ters were accounted beauties; and &s;he, from her comparative want of per&s;onal charms, having been le&s;s beloved by her parents, and le&s;s care&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who vi&s;ited them than the re&s;t, had for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;ought other re&s;ources of happine&s;s than the affection, prai&s;e, and indulgence of her fellow-creatures. She read&mdash;but more&mdash;&s;he thought. The choice&s;t books from her father's little library taught her to think; and reflection fa&s;hioned her mind to bear the &s;lights, the mortifications of neglect, with a patient dejection, rather than with an indignant or a peevi&s;h &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This re&s;ignation to injury and con|tumely gave to her perfect &s;ymmetry of per&s;on, a timid eye, a retiring manner, and &s;pread upon her face a placid &s;weet|ne&s;s, a pale &s;erenity mixed with &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te, that no wi&s;e connoi&s;&s;eur in female charms would have exchanged for all the &s;parkling eyes and florid tints of her vain and vulgar &s;i&s;ters.&mdash;Henry's &s;oul was &s;o much enamoured of her gentle deportment that in his &s;ight &s;he ap|peared beautiful; while &s;ue, with an un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="96" REF="95">
competent to judge of his worth, was &s;o greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;o pro|digiou&s;ly a&s;toni&s;hed at the di&s;tinction, the attention, the many offices of civility paid to her by him in preference to her idoli&s;ed &s;i&s;ters, that her gratitude for &s;uch unexpected favours had &s;ometimes (even in his pre&s;ence, and in that of her fa|mily) nearly drowned her eyes with tears. Yet, they were only trifles, in which Henry had the opportunity or the power to give her te&s;timony of his regard&mdash;trifles often more grateful to the &s;en&s;ible mind than efforts of high importance; and by which, the arti&s;t in the human heart will accurately trace a pa&s;&s;ion, wholly concealed from the dull eye of the un&s;killed ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cau&s;e of amazement to Re|becca in the manners of Henry was, that he talked with <HI>her</HI> as well as with her &s;i&s;ters; no vi&s;itor el&s;e had done &s;o. In taking a morning's or an evening's walk, he propo&s;ed <HI>her</HI> going with the re&s;t; no one had ever required her company be|fore. When he called and &s;he was ab|&s;ent, he a&s;ked where &s;he was; no one
<PB N="97" REF="96">
had ever mi&s;&s;ed her before.&mdash;She thanked him from her very heart, and &s;oon per|ceived that at tho&s;e times, when he was pre&s;ent, company was more plea&s;ing even than books.</P>
<P>Her a&s;toni&s;hment, her gratitude, did not &s;top here&mdash;Henry proceeded in at|tention&mdash;he &s;oon &s;elected her from her &s;i&s;ters to tell the news of the day when he chanced to call; an&s;wered her ob&s;er|vations the fir&s;t; once gave her a &s;prig of myrtle from his bo&s;om in preference to another who had prai&s;ed its beauty; and once&mdash;never to be forgotten kindne&s;s&mdash;&s;heltered her from a ha&s;ty &s;hower with his <HI>parapluie,</HI> while he lamented to her drenched companions,</P>
<P>"That he had but <HI>one</HI> to offer."</P>
<P>From a man who&s;e &s;en&s;e and per&s;on they admire, how dear, how impre&s;&s;ive on the female heart is every trait of ten|derne&s;s! Till now, Rebecca had ex|perienced none; not even of the parental kind; and merely from the overflowings of a kind nature (not in return for af|fection) had &s;he ever loved her father and her &s;i&s;ters. Sometimes, repul&s;ed by their
<PB N="98" REF="97">
&s;everity, &s;he transferred the fulne&s;s of an affectionate heart upon animals: but now her alienated mind was recalled and &s;oftened by a &s;en&s;ation that made her long to complain of the burthen it im|po&s;ed&mdash;tho&s;e obligations which exact &s;ilence, are a heavy weight to the grate|ful&mdash;Rebecca longed to tell Henry "that her life would be too little to expre&s;s the full &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the re&s;pect he paid to her." But as mode&s;ty forbade not only every kind of declaration, but every in|&s;inuation purporting what &s;he felt, &s;he wept through &s;leeple&s;s nights from a load of &s;uppre&s;&s;ed explanation; yet &s;till &s;he would not have exchanged this trouble, for all the beauty of her &s;i&s;ters.</P>

<P>OLD John and Hannah Primro&s;e, a prudent hardy couple, who, by many years of peculiar labour and peculiar ab|&s;tinence, were the lea&s;t poor of all the neighbouring cottagers, had an only child called after the mother, Hannah: and this cottage girl was reckoned, in &s;pite of the beauty of the elder Mi&s;s Rymers, by far the prettie&s;t female in the village.</P>

<P>When young William &s;aw Hannah, he thought her even more beautiful than &s;he was thought by others; and on tho&s;e days that he felt no inclination to ride, to &s;hoot, or to hunt, he would contrive, by &s;ome &s;ecret device, the means to meet with her alone, and give her tokens (if not of his love) at lea&s;t of his admiration of her beauty, and of the plea&s;ure he enjoyed in her company.</P>
<P>Hannah li&s;tened with a kind of de|lirious enchantment to all her elevated and eloquent admirer uttered; and in return for his prai&s;es of her charms, and his equivocal replies, in re&s;pect to his de|&s;igns towards her, gave to him, her mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed thoughts, and her whole en|raptured heart.</P>
<P>This, to her apparently harmle&s;s, in|tercour&s;e had not la&s;ted many weeks be|fore
<PB N="101" REF="100">
&s;he loved him&mdash;&s;he even confe&s;&s;ed &s;he did, every time that any unwonted mark of attention from him, &s;truck with unexpected force her infatuated &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by a celebrated writer, upon the affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two &s;exes, "that there are many per&s;ons who, if they had never heard of the pa&s;&s;ion of love, would never have felt it." Might it not with equal truth be added, that&mdash;there are many more, who having heard of it, and believing mo&s;t firmly that they feel it, are neverthele&s;s mi&s;taken? Neither of the&s;e ca&s;es was the lot of Hannah. She experienced the &s;entiment before &s;he ever heard it named in that &s;en&s;e in which &s;he felt it&mdash;and &s;he felt it as genuine love alone exi&s;ts&mdash;joined with numerous other &s;entiments: for love, however rated by many, as the chief pa&s;&s;ion of the human heart, is but a poor dependant, a retainer upon other pa&s;&s;ions; admiration, gratitude, re&s;pect, e&s;teem, pride in the object&mdash;dive&s;t the boa&s;ted &s;en&s;ation of the&s;e, and it is no more than the impre&s;&s;ion of a twelve-month, by courte&s;y, or vulgar error, termed love.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101">Hannah was formed by the rare&s;t &s;truc|ture of the human frame, and fated by the tendere&s;t thrillings of the human &s;oul, to in&s;pire and to experience real love&mdash;but her nice ta&s;te, her delicate thoughts, were &s;o refined beyond the &s;phere of her own &s;tation in &s;ociety, that nature would have produced this prodigy of attraction in vain, had not one of &s;uperior educa|tion and manners a&s;&s;ailed her heart: and had &s;he been accu&s;tomed to the conver|&s;ation of men in William's rank of life, &s;he had, perhaps, treated William's ad|dre&s;&s;es with indifference; but in com|paring him with her familiar acquaint|ance, he was a miracle! His unremitted attention &s;eemed the conde&s;cen&s;ion of a &s;uperior being, to whom &s;he looked up with reverence, with admiration, with awe, with pride, with &s;en&s;e of obliga|tion&mdash;and all tho&s;e various pa&s;&s;ions which con&s;titute true, and <HI>never</HI> to be eradi|cated, love.</P>
<P>But in vain &s;he felt and even avowed with her lips what every look, every ge&s;ture, had long denoted; William, with di&s;content, &s;ometimes with anger, up|braided
<PB N="103" REF="102">
her for her fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, and vowed "That while one tender proof, which he fervently be&s;ought, was want|ing, &s;he did but aggravate his mi&s;ery by le&s;&s;er endearments."</P>
<P>Hannah had been taught the full e&s;ti|mation of female virtue; and if her na|ture could have dete&s;ted one being in a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s, it would have been the woman who had lo&s;t her honour: yet, for William, what would not Hannah forfeit? The dignity, the peace, the &s;e|renity, the innocence of her own mind, love &s;oon encouraged her to fancy &s;he could ea&s;ily forego&mdash;and this &s;ame over|powering influence at times &s;o forcibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her, that &s;he even felt a mo|mentary tran&s;port in the idea "of &s;o pre|cious a &s;acrifice to him."&mdash;But then &s;he loved her parents; and their happine&s;s &s;he could not prevail on her&s;elf to barter even for <HI>his.</HI> She wi&s;hed he would de|mand &s;ome other pledge of her affection; for there was none but this, her ruin in no other &s;hape, that &s;he would deny at his reque&s;t. While thus &s;he deliberated &s;he prepared for her fall.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103">Bred up with &s;trict ob&s;ervance both to his moral and religious character, Wil|liam did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even to his inferiors&mdash;he never pro|mi&s;ed Hannah he would marry her; nay even, he paid &s;o much re&s;pect to the forms of truth, that no &s;ooner was it evident that he had obtained her heart, her whole &s;oul entire&mdash;&s;o that lo&s;s of innocence would be le&s;s terrifying than &s;eparation from him&mdash;no &s;ooner did he perceive this, than he candidly told her he "could never make her his wife."&mdash;At the &s;ame time he lamented "the difference of their births, and the duty he owed his parents' hopes," in terms &s;o pathetic to her par|tial ear, that &s;he thought him a greater object of compa&s;&s;ion in love, even than her&s;elf; and was now urged by pity to remove the cau&s;e of his complainings.</P>
<P>One evening Henry accidentally pa&s;&s;ed the lonely &s;pot where William and &s;he con&s;tantly met&mdash;he ob&s;erved his cou&s;in's impa&s;&s;ioned eye, and her affectionate, yet fearful glance. William, he &s;aw, took delight in the agitation of mind, in the &s;trong apprehen&s;ion mixed with the love
<PB N="105" REF="104">
of Hannah; this convinced Henry that either he, or him&s;elf, was not in love: for his heart told him he would not have beheld &s;uch emotions of tenderne&s;s min|gled with &s;uch marks of &s;orrow, upon the countenance of Rebecca, for the wealth of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time he was alone with Wil|liam after this, he mentioned his ob&s;er|vation on Hannah's apparent affliction, and a&s;ked "Why her grief was the re&s;ult of their &s;tolen meetings?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," replied William, "her profe&s;&s;ions are unlimited, while her man|ners are re&s;erved; and I accu&s;e her of loving me with unkind moderation, while I love her to di&s;traction."</P>
<P>"You de&s;ign to marry her then?"</P>
<P>"How can you degrade me by the &s;up|po&s;ition?"</P>
<P>"Would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her your companion? To talk with her for hours in preference to all other company? To wi&s;h to be en|deared to her by &s;till clo&s;er ties?"</P>
<P>"But all this is not rai&s;ing her to the rank of my wife."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="105">"It is &s;till rai&s;ing her to that rank, for which wives alone were allotted."</P>
<P>"You talk wildly!&mdash;I tell you I love her; but not enough, I hope, to marry her."</P>
<P>"But too much, I hope, to undo her?"</P>
<P>"That mu&s;t be her own free choice&mdash;I make u&s;e of no unwarrantable me|thods."</P>
<P>"What are the warrantable ones?"</P>
<P>"I mean, I have made her no fal&s;e promi&s;es&mdash;offered no pretended &s;ettle|ment&mdash;vowed no eternal con&s;tancy."</P>
<P>"But you have told her you love her; and, from that confe&s;&s;ion, has &s;he not rea&s;on to expect every protection which even promi&s;es could &s;ecure?"</P>
<P>"I cannot an&s;wer for her expectations&mdash;but I know, if &s;he &s;hould make me happy as I a&s;k, and I &s;hould then for&s;ake her, I &s;hall not break my word."</P>
<P>"Still &s;he will be deceived; for you will fal&s;ify your looks."</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;he depends on my looks?"</P>
<P>"I have read in &s;ome book, <HI>Looks are the lover's &s;ole dependence.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106">"I have no objection to her interpret|ing mine in her favour; but then for the con&s;equences, &s;he will have her&s;elf, and only her&s;elf to blame."</P>
<P>"Oh! heaven!"</P>
<P>"What makes you exclaim &s;o vehe|mently?"</P>
<P>"An idea of the bitterne&s;s of that ca|lamity which inflicts &s;elf-reproach! Oh rather deceive her&mdash;leave her the con|&s;olation to reproach you, <HI>rather than</HI> her&s;elf."</P>
<P>"My honour will not &s;uffer me."</P>
<P>"Exert your honour, and never &s;ee her more."</P>
<P>"I cannot live without her."</P>
<P>"Then live with her by the laws of your country; and make her, and your&s;elf both happy."</P>
<P>"Am I to make my father and my mother mi&s;erable? They would di&s;own me for &s;uch a &s;tep."</P>
<P>"Your mother, perhaps, might be of|fended, but your father could not. Re|member the &s;ermon he preached but la&s;t Sunday, upon&mdash;<HI>the &s;hortne&s;s of this life: contempt of all riches and worldly honours

<P>"My father is a very good man," &s;aid William, "and yet, in&s;tead of be|ing &s;atisfied with an humble roof, he looks impatiently forward to a bi&s;hop's palace."</P>
<P>"He is &s;o very good then," &s;aid Henry, "that perhaps, &s;eeing the dangers to which men in exalted &s;tations are ex|po&s;ed, he has &s;uch extreme philanthropy, and &s;o little &s;elf-love, he would rather that him&s;elf &s;hould brave tho&s;e perils in|cidental to wealth and grandeur, than any other per&s;on."</P>
<P>"You are not yet civili&s;ed," &s;aid William; "and to argue with you, is but to in&s;truct, without gaining in&s;truc|tion."</P>
<P>"I know, Sir," replied Henry, "that you are &s;tudying the law mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, and have va&s;t pro&s;pects of ri&s;ing to emi|nence in your profe&s;&s;ion: but let me hint to you&mdash;that though you may be perfect in the knowledge how to ad|mini&s;ter

<P>THE dean's family pa&s;&s;ed this fir&s;t &s;ummer at the new-purcha&s;ed e&s;tate &s;o plea&s;antly, that they left it with regret when winter called them to their hou&s;e in town.</P>
<P>But if &s;ome felt concern on quitting the village of Anfield, &s;ome who were left behind felt the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. Tho&s;e were not the poor&mdash;for rigid attention to the morals of people in poverty, and total neglect of their bodily wants, was the dean's practice. He forced them to attend church on every &s;abbath; but whether they had a dinner on their re|turn, was too gro&s;s and temporal an en|quiry for his &s;piritual fervour. Good of the <HI>&s;oul</HI> was all he aimed at; and this pious undertaking, be&s;ides his diligence as a pa&s;tor, required all his exertion as a magi&s;trate&mdash;for to be very poor and very hone&s;t, very oppre&s;&s;ed yet very thankful, is a degree of &s;ainted excellence not to be attained without the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">Tho&s;e then, who alone felt &s;orrow at the dean's departure, were two young women, who&s;e parents, exempt from in|digence, pre&s;erved them from &s;uffering under his unpitying piety; but who&s;e di&s;|cretion had not protected them from the bewitching &s;miles of his nephew, and &s;e|ducing wiles of his &s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t morning that Rebecca ro&s;e and knew Henry was gone till the follow|ing &s;ummer, &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he could have lain down again and &s;lept away the whole long interval. Her &s;i&s;ters' peevi&s;hne&s;s, her father's au&s;terity, &s;he fore&s;aw, would be in&s;upportable now that &s;he had ex|perienced Henry's kindne&s;s, and he was no longer near to fortify her patience. She &s;ighed&mdash;&s;he wept&mdash;&s;he was unhappy.</P>
<P>But if Rebecca awoke with a dejected mind and an a king heart, what were the &s;orrows of Hannah? The only child of two doating parents, &s;he never had been taught the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;ignation&mdash;un|tutored, unread, unu&s;ed to reflect, but knowing how to <HI>feel;</HI> what were her &s;uf|ferings when, on waking, &s;he called to mind that "William was gone," and
<PB N="112" REF="111">
with him gone all that exce&s;s of hap|pine&s;s which his pre&s;ence had be&s;towed, and for which &s;he had exchanged her fu|ture tranquillity.</P>
<P>Lo&s;s of tranquillity even Rebecca had to bemoan&mdash;Hannah had &s;till more&mdash;the lo&s;s of innocence!</P>
<P>Had William remained in the village, &s;hame, even con&s;cience perhaps had &s;lept; but &s;eparated from her betrayer, parted from the joys of guilt, and left only to its &s;orrows, every &s;ting which quick &s;en|&s;ibility could &s;harpen, was transfixed in her heart to torture her. Fir&s;t came the recollection of a cold farewell from the man who&s;e love &s;he had hoped her yield|ing pa&s;&s;ion had for ever won&mdash;next, fla&s;hed on her thoughts her violated per|&s;on&mdash;next, the crime incurred&mdash;next, her cruelty to her tender parents&mdash;and la&s;t of all came the horrors of detection.</P>
<P>She knew that as yet, by warine&s;s, care, and contrivance, her meetings with Wil|liam had been un&s;u&s;pected; but in this agony of mind her fears foreboded an in|former who would defy all caution; who would &s;tigmati&s;e her with a name&mdash;dear
<PB N="113" REF="112">
and de&s;ired by every virtuous female&mdash;abhorrent to the blu&s;hing harlot&mdash;the name of mother.</P>
<P>That Hannah, thus impre&s;&s;ed, could ri&s;e from her bed, meet her parents and her neighbours with her u&s;ual &s;mile of vivacity, and voice of mirth, was impo&s;|&s;ible&mdash;to leave her bed at all, to creep down &s;tairs, and reply in a faint broken voice to que&s;tions a&s;ked, were, in her &s;tate of mind, mighty efforts; and all to which her &s;truggles could attain for many weeks.</P>
<P>William had promi&s;ed to write to her while he was away: he kept his word; but not till the end of two months &s;he received a letter. Fears for his health, apprehen&s;ion of his death during this cruel interval, cau&s;ed an agony of &s;u&s;|pence that, by repre&s;enting him to her di&s;tracted fancy in a &s;tate of &s;uffering, made him, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till dearer to her. In the excruciating angui&s;h of uncer|tainty, &s;he walked with trembling &s;teps through all weathers (when &s;he could &s;teal half a day while her parents were employed in labour abroad) to the po&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="113">
town at &s;ix miles di&s;tance, to enquire for his long expected, long wi&s;hed for letter. When at la&s;t it was given to her, that moment of con&s;olation &s;eemed to repay her for the whole time of agoni&s;ing terror &s;he had endured. "He is alive!" &s;he &s;aid, "and I have &s;uffered nothing."</P>
<P>She ha&s;tily put this token of his health and his remembrance of her into her bo&s;om, rich as an empre&s;s with a new-acquired dominion. The way from home, which &s;he had trod with heavy pace, in the fear of renewed di&s;appointment, &s;he &s;kimmed along on her return &s;wift as a doe&mdash;the cold did not pierce, neither did the rain wet her. Many a time &s;he put her hand upon the prize &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to find if it were &s;afe&mdash;once, on the road, &s;he took it from her bo&s;om, curiou&s;ly viewed the &s;eal and the direction, then replacing it, did not move her fingers from their fa&s;t gripe, till &s;he arrived at home.</P>
<P>Her father and her mother were &s;till ab&s;ent. She drew a chair, and placing it near to the only window in the room, &s;eated her&s;elf with ceremonious order;
<PB N="115" REF="114">
and then, gently drew forth her trea&s;ure; laid it on her knee; and with a &s;mile that almo&s;t amounted to a laugh of glad|ne&s;s, once more in&s;pected the outward part, before &s;he would tru&s;t her&s;elf with the exce&s;&s;ive joy of looking within.</P>

<P>ABSENCE is &s;aid to encrea&s;e &s;trong and virtuous love, but to de&s;troy that which is weak and &s;en&s;ual. In the parallel between young William and young Henry, this was the ca&s;e; for Henry's real love encrea&s;ed, while William's turbulent pa&s;|&s;ion declined in &s;eparation: yet had the latter not &s;o much abated that he did not perceive a &s;en&s;ation, like a &s;udden &s;hock of &s;orrow, on a propo&s;al made him by his father, of entering the marriage &s;tate with a young woman, the dependent niece of Lady Bendham; who, as the dean informed him, had &s;ignified her lord's and her own approbation of his be|coming their nephew.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t moment William received this intimation from his father, his heart revolted with di&s;gu&s;t from the object, and he in&s;tantly thought upon Hannah, with more affection than he had done for many weeks before. This was from the com|pari&s;on between her and his propo&s;ed
<PB N="119" REF="118">
wife; for he had frequently &s;een Mi&s;s Sedgeley at Lord Bendham's, but had never &s;een in her whole per&s;on, or man|ners, the lea&s;t attraction to excite his love. He pictured to him&s;elf an unplea&s;ant home with a companion &s;o little &s;uited to his ta&s;te, and felt a pang of con&s;cience, as well as of attachment, in the thought of giving up poor Hannah.</P>
<P>But the&s;e reflections, the&s;e feelings la&s;ted no longer than for the moment: no &s;ooner had the dean explained why the marriage was de&s;irable, recited what great connections, and what great pa|tronage it would confer upon their fa|mily, than William li&s;tened with eager|ne&s;s, and both his love and his con&s;cience were, if not wholly quieted, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent hu&s;hed.</P>
<P>Immediately after the dean had ex|pre&s;&s;ed to Lord and Lady Bendham his &s;on's "&s;en&s;e of the honour and the hap|pine&s;s conferred on him by their con|de&s;cen&s;ion in admitting him a member of their noble family"&mdash;Mi&s;s Sedgeley re|ceived from her aunt, nearly the &s;ame &s;hock as William had done from his
<PB N="120" REF="119">
father. <HI>For &s;he had frequently &s;een the dean's &s;on at Lord Bendham's, but had never &s;een in his whole per&s;on or manners the lea&s;t attraction to excite her love&mdash;&s;he pictured to her&s;elf an unplea&s;ant home with a companion &s;o little &s;uited to her ta&s;te:</HI> and at this mo|ment &s;he felt a more than u&s;ual partiality to the dean's nephew, finding the &s;ecret hope &s;he had long indulged, of winning his affections, &s;o near being thwarted.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Sedgeley was too much &s;ub|jected to the power of her uncle and aunt to have a will of her own, at lea&s;t, to dare to utter it. She received the com|mands of Lady Bendham with her ac|cu&s;tomed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, while all the con|&s;olation for the grief they gave her was, "that &s;he re&s;olved to make a very bad wife."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not care a pin for my hu&s;band," &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "and &s;o I will dre&s;s and vi&s;it, and do ju&s;t as I like&mdash;he dares not be unkind becau&s;e of my aunt. Be|&s;ides, now I think again, it is not &s;o di&s;|agreeable to marry <HI>him</HI> as if I were ob|liged to marry into any other family, be|cau&s;e I &s;hall &s;ee his cou&s;in Henry as often, if not oftener, than ever.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="120">For Mi&s;s Sedgeley, with a per&s;on he did not like, and with a mind thus di&s;|po&s;ed, William began to force him&s;elf to &s;hake off every little remaining affection, even all pity, for the unfortunate, the beautiful, the &s;en&s;ible, the doating Han|nah; and determined to place in a &s;itua|tion to look down with &s;corn upon her &s;orrows, this weak, this unprincipled woman.</P>
<P>Connections, intere&s;t, honours, were powerful advocates&mdash;his private happi|ne&s;s William deemed trivial, compared to public opinion&mdash;and to be under obliga|tions to a peer his wife's relation, gave greater renown in his &s;ervile mind, than all the advantages that might accrue from his own intrin&s;ic independent worth.</P>
<P>In the u&s;ual routine of pretended re|gard, and real indifference, &s;ometimes di&s;gu&s;t, between parties allied by what is fal&s;ely termed <HI>prudence,</HI> the intended union of Mr. Norwynne with Mi&s;s Sedge|ley proceeded in all due form; and at their country &s;eats at Anfield, during the &s;ummer, their nuptials were appointed to be celebrated.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121">William was now introduced into all Lord Bendham's courtly circles&mdash;his worldly &s;oul was entranced in glare and &s;how&mdash;he thought of nothing but places, pen&s;ions, titles, retinues: and &s;tedfa&s;t, alert, un&s;haken in the pur&s;uit of honours, neglected not the le&s;&s;er means of ri&s;ing to preferment&mdash;his own endowments. But in this round of attention to plea&s;ures and to &s;tudy, he no more complained to Han|nah of "exce&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s." Cruel as &s;he had once thought that letter in which he thus apologi&s;ed for neglecting her, &s;he at la&s;t began to think it was wondrous kind; for he never found time to &s;end her another. Yet &s;he had &s;tudied with all her mo&s;t anxious care to write him an an&s;wer; &s;uch a one as might not le&s;&s;en her under&s;tanding, which he had often prai&s;ed, in his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Ah William! even with le&s;s anxiety your beating ambitious heart panted for the admiration of an attentive auditory, when you fir&s;t ventured to harangue in public!&mdash;With far le&s;s hope and fear (great as yours were) did you fir&s;t addre&s;s a crowded court, and thir&s;t for its appro|bation

Yet &s;he had enough to tell, if &s;hame had not interpo&s;ed&mdash;or, if remain|ing confidence in his affection had but encouraged her.</P>
<P>Overwhelmed by the fir&s;t, and de|prived of the la&s;t, her hand &s;hook, her head drooped, and &s;he dared not com|municate what &s;he knew mu&s;t inevitably render her letter unplea&s;ing: and &s;till more depreciate her in his regard as the occa&s;ion of encumbrance; and of injury to his moral reputation.</P>

<P>SUMMER arrived&mdash;and lords and la|dies who had partaken of all the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of the town, whom opera-hou&s;es, gaming-hou&s;es, and various other hou&s;es had detained whole nights from their peaceful home, were now poured forth from the metropolis, to imbibe the whole|&s;ome air of the farmer and pea&s;ant, and di&s;&s;eminate in return moral and religious principles.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, Lord and Lady Bend|ham, &s;trenuous oppo&s;ers of vice in the poor, and gentle &s;upporters of it in the rich, never played at cards, or had con|certs on a Sunday, in the village, where the poor were &s;pies&mdash;<HI>he</HI> there never gamed, or drank, except in private&mdash;and <HI>&s;he</HI> bani&s;hed from her doors every female of &s;ullied character. Yet poverty and idioti&s;m are not the &s;ame&mdash;the poor can hear, can talk, &s;ometimes can reflect&mdash;&s;ervants will tell their equals how they live in town&mdash;li&s;teners will &s;mile and
<PB N="126" REF="125">
&s;hake their heads&mdash;and thus, hypocri&s;y, in&s;tead of cultivating, de&s;troys every &s;eed of moral virtue.</P>
<P>The arrival of Lord Bendham's family at Anfield, announced to the village that the dean's would quickly follow. Re|becca's heart bounded with joy at the pro&s;pect&mdash;Poor Hannah felt a &s;inking, a foreboding tremor, that wholly inter|rupted the joy of <HI>her</HI> expectations&mdash;She had not heard from William for five te|dious months&mdash;&s;he did not know whether he loved or de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;whether he thought of, or had forgotten her. Her rea&s;on ar|gued again&s;t the hope that he loved her&mdash;yet hope &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted&mdash;&s;he would not abandon her&s;elf to de&s;pair while there was doubt&mdash;&s;he "had frequently been deceived from the appearance of circum|&s;tances, and perhaps he might come all kindne&s;s&mdash;perhaps&mdash;even not like her the le&s;s for that indi&s;po&s;ition which had changed her bloom to palene&s;s, and the &s;parkling of her eyes to a pen&s;ive lan|guor."</P>
<P>Henry's &s;en&s;ations on his return to An|field were the &s;elf-&s;ame as Rebecca's were:
<PB N="127" REF="126">
&s;ympathy in thought, &s;ympathy in affec|tion, &s;ympathy in virtue, made them &s;o. As he approached near the little village, he felt more light than u&s;ual. He had committed no tre&s;pa&s;s there, dreaded no one's reproach or enquiries, but his ar|rival might prove, at lea&s;t to one object, the cau&s;e of rejoicing.</P>
<P>William's &s;en&s;ations were the rever&s;e of the&s;e. In &s;pite of his ambition, and the flattering view of accompli&s;hing all to which it a&s;pired, he often, as they pro|ceeded on their journey, envied the gaiety of Henry, and felt an inward monitor, that told him, "he mu&s;t fir&s;t act like Henry, to be as happy."</P>
<P>His intended marriage was &s;till, to the families of both parties, (except to the heads of the hou&s;es) a profound &s;ecret. Neither the &s;ervants, nor even Henry had received the &s;lighte&s;t intimation of the de&s;igned alliance; and this to William was matter of &s;ome comfort.</P>
<P>When men &s;ubmit to act in contradic|tion to their principles, nothing is &s;o pre|cious as a &s;ecret. In their e&s;timation, to have their conduct <HI>known</HI> is the e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="128" REF="127">
mi&s;chief&mdash;while it is hid, they fancy the &s;in but half committed; and to the moiety of a crime they reconcile their feelings, till, in progre&s;&s;ion, the whole, when di&s;clo&s;ed, appears trivial. He de|&s;igned that Hannah &s;hould receive the news from him&s;elf by degrees, and in &s;uch a manner as to con&s;ole her, or at lea&s;t to &s;ilence her complaints: and with the wi&s;h to &s;often, the &s;omething like, re|gret, which he &s;till felt on the prudent nece&s;&s;ity of yielding her up when his marriage &s;hould take place, he promi&s;ed to him&s;elf &s;ome intervening hours of pri|vate meetings, which he hoped would produce &s;atiety.</P>
<P>While Henry flew to Mr. Rymer's hou&s;e with a con&s;cience clear, and a face enlightened with gladne&s;s; while he met Rebecca with open-hearted friend&s;hip and frankne&s;s that charmed her foul to peaceful happine&s;s; William &s;kulked around the cottage of Hannah, dreading detection; and when towards midnight he found the means to obtain the com|pany of the &s;ad inhabitant, he grew &s;o impatient at her tears and &s;obs, at the
<PB N="129" REF="128">
delicacy with which &s;he with-held her care&s;&s;es, that he bur&s;t into bitter upbraid|ings at her coyne&s;s; and at length (with|out di&s;covering the cau&s;e of her peculiar agitation and re&s;erve) abruptly left her, vowing "never to &s;ee her more."</P>
<P>As he turned away, his heart even con|gratulated him, "that he had made &s;o di&s;creet a u&s;e of his momentary di&s;ap|pointment, as thus to &s;hake her off at once without farther explanation or ex|cu&s;e."</P>
<P>She, ignorant and illiterate as &s;he was, knew enough of her own heart to judge of his, and to know, that &s;uch violent affections and expre&s;&s;ions, above all, &s;uch a &s;udden, heart-breaking, manner of de|parture, were not the effects of love: not even of humanity. She felt her&s;elf de|ba&s;ed by a ruffian&mdash;yet &s;till, having loved him when &s;he thought him otherwi&s;e, the blacke&s;t proof of the deception could not era&s;e a &s;entiment, formed while &s;he was deceived.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night in angui&s;h&mdash;but with the cheerful morn|ing &s;ome cheerly thoughts aro&s;e. She
<PB N="130" REF="129">
thought "perhaps William by this time had found him&s;elf to blame&mdash;had con|ceived the cau&s;e of her grief and her di&s;tant behaviour, and had pitied her."</P>
<P>The next evening &s;he waited with anxious heart for the &s;ignal that had called her out the foregoing night&mdash;in vain &s;he watched, counted the hours, and the &s;tars, and li&s;tened to the nightly &s;till|ne&s;s of the fields around: they were not di&s;turbed by the tread of her lover.&mdash;Day-light came; the &s;un ro&s;e in its &s;plen|dour; William had not been near her, and it &s;hone upon none &s;o mi&s;erable as Hannah.</P>
<P>She now con&s;idered his word, "never to &s;ee her more," as &s;olemnly pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;&s;he heard anew the impre&s;&s;ive, the im|placable tone in which the &s;entence was pronounced; and could look back on no late token of affection, on which to found the &s;lighte&s;t hope that he would recall it.</P>
<P>Still, reluctant to de&s;pair&mdash;in the ex|tremity of grief, in the extremity of fear for an approaching cri&s;is that mu&s;t &s;pee|dily arrive, &s;he (after a few days had elap&s;ed) tru&s;ted a neighbouring pea&s;ant

with a letter to deliver to Mr. Norwynne in private.</P>
<P>This letter, unlike the la&s;t, was dictated without the hope to plea&s;e&mdash;no pains were taken with the &s;tyle, no care in the for|mation of the letters&mdash;the words flowed from nece&s;&s;ity; &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity guided her hand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the dean's family had been at Anfield about a month&mdash;One mi&s;ty morning, &s;uch as portends a &s;ultry day, as Henry was walking &s;wiftly through a thick wood on the &s;kirts of the pari&s;h, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted on hearing a di&s;tant groan, expre&s;&s;ive as he thought, both of bodily and mental pain. He &s;topped to hear it repeated that he might pur&s;ue the &s;ound. He heard it again; and though now but in murmurs, yet as the tone im|plied exce&s;&s;ive grief, he directed his cour&s;e to that part of the wood from whence it came.</P>
<P>As he advanced, in &s;pite of the thick fog, he di&s;cerned the appearance of a fe|male &s;cudding away on his approach. His eye was fixed on this object; and re|gardle&s;s where he placed his feet, &s;oon he &s;hrunk back with horror, on perceiving they had nearly trod upon a new-born infant, lying on the ground!&mdash;a lovely male child, entered on a world where
<PB N="134" REF="133">
not one preparation had been made to receive him.</P>
<P>"Ah!" cried Henry, forgetting the per|&s;on who had fled, and with a &s;mile of compa&s;&s;ion on the helple&s;s infant, "I am glad I have found you&mdash;you give more joy to me, than you have done to your haple&s;s parents. Poor dear," (continued he, while he took off his coat to wrap it in,) "I will take care of you while I live&mdash;I will beg for you rather than you &s;hall want&mdash;but fir&s;t, I will carry you to tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent can do more for you than my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Thus Henry &s;aid, and though while he inclo&s;ed the child carefully in his coat, and took it in his arms. But about to walk his way with it, an unlucky query &s;truck him, <HI>where he &s;hould go.</HI></P>
<P>"I mu&s;t not take it to the dean's," he cried, "becau&s;e Lady Clementina will &s;u&s;pect it is not nobly, and my uncle will &s;u&s;pect it is not lawfully, born. Nor mu&s;t I take it to Lord Bendham's for the &s;elf-&s;ame rea&s;on&mdash;though, could it call Lady Bendham mother, this whole vil|lage, nay the whole country round would
<PB N="135" REF="134">
ring with rejoicings for its birth. How &s;trange!" continued he, "that, we &s;hould make &s;o little of human creatures, that one &s;ent among us, wholly independent of his own high value, becomes a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing by the mere accident of worthle&s;s circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>He now, after walking out of the wood, peeped through the folds of his coat to look again at his charge&mdash;He &s;tarted, turned pale, and trembled to behold what, in the &s;urpri&s;e of fir&s;t &s;eeing the child, had e&s;caped his ob&s;ervation. Around its little throat was a cord entwined by a &s;lipping noo&s;e, and drawn half way&mdash;as if the trembling hand of the murderer had revolted from its dreadful office, and he or &s;he had left the infant to pine away with nakedne&s;s and hunger, rather than <HI>&s;ee</HI> it die.</P>
<P>Again Henry wi&s;hed him&s;elf joy of the trea&s;ure he had found; and more &s;ervent|ly than before; for he had not only pre|&s;erved one fellow creature from death, but another from murder.</P>
<P>Once more he looked at his charge, and was tran&s;ported to ob&s;erve, upon its &s;erene
<PB N="136" REF="135">
brow and &s;leepy eye, no traces of the dangers it had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;no trait of &s;hame either for it&s;elf or its parents&mdash;no di&s;com|po&s;ure at the unwelcome reception it was likely to encounter from a proud world!&mdash;He now &s;lipped the fatal &s;tring from its neck; and; by this affectionate di&s;turbance cau&s;ing the child to cry, he ran (but he &s;carce knew whither) to con|vey it to a better nur&s;e.</P>
<P>He at length found him&s;elf at the door of his dear Rebecca&mdash;for &s;o very happy Henry felt at the good luck which had befallen him, that he longed to be&s;tow a part of the ble&s;&s;ing upon her he loved.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for her privately out of the hou&s;e to &s;peak to him.&mdash;When &s;he came,</P>
<P>"Rebecca," &s;aid he (looking around that no one ob&s;erved him) "Rebecca, I have brought you &s;omething you will like."</P>
<P>"What is it?" &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"You know, Rebecca, that you love de&s;erted birds, &s;trayed kittens, and mo|therle&s;s lambs&mdash;I have brought &s;ome|thing more pitiable than any of the&s;e.
<PB N="137" REF="136">
Go, and get a cap and a little gown, and then I will give it you."</P>
<P>"A gown!" exclaimed Rebecca. "If you have brought me a monkey, much as I &s;hould e&s;teem any pre&s;ent from <HI>you,</HI> indeed I cannot touch it."</P>
<P>"A monkey!" repeated Henry, al|mo&s;t in anger&mdash;then changing the tone of his voice, exclaimed in triumph,</P>
<P>"It is a child!"</P>
<P>On this he gave it a gentle pinch, that its cry might confirm the plea&s;ing truth he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"A child!" Repeated Rebecca in amaze.</P>
<P>"Yes, and indeed I found it."</P>
<P>"Found it?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I did. The mother, I fear, had ju&s;t for&s;aken it."</P>
<P>"Inhuman creature!"</P>
<P>"Nay, hold Rebecca! I am &s;ure you will pity her when you &s;ee her child&mdash;you then will know &s;he mu&s;t have loved it&mdash;and will con&s;ider how much &s;he cer|tainly had &s;uffered, before &s;he left it to peri&s;h in a wood."</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="137">"Cruel!" Once more exclaimed Re|becca.</P>
<P>"Oh! Rebecca, perhaps, had &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a home of her own, &s;he would have given it the be&s;t place in it&mdash;had &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed money, &s;he would have dre&s;&s;ed it with the nice&s;t care&mdash;or had &s;he been ac|cu&s;tomed to di&s;grace, &s;he would have gloried in calling it hers! But now, as it is, it is &s;ent to us, to you and me, Re|becca, to take care of."</P>
<P>Rebecca, &s;oothed by Henry's compa&s;|&s;ionate eloquence, held out her arms and received the important parcel&mdash;and, as &s;he kindly looked in upon the little &s;tranger,</P>
<P>"Now are not you much obliged to me," &s;aid Henry, "for having brought it to you? I know no one but your&s;elf to whom I would have tru&s;ted it with plea|&s;ure."</P>
<P>"Much obliged to you," repeated Re|becca with a very &s;erious face, "if I did but know what to do with it&mdash;where to put it&mdash;where to hide it from my fa|ther and &s;i&s;ters."</P>

<P>THERE is a word in the vocabulary more bitter, more direful in its import, than all the re&s;t.&mdash;Reader, if poverty, if di&s;grace, if bodily pain, even if &s;lighted love is your unhappy fate, kneel and ble&s;s heaven for its beneficent influence, &s;o that you are not tortured with the an|gui&s;h of&mdash;<HI>remor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Deep contrition for pa&s;t offences had long been the puni&s;hment of unhappy Hannah; but till the day &s;he brought her child into the world, <HI>remor&s;e</HI> had been averted. From that day life be|came an in&s;upportable load, for all reflec|tion was torture! To think&mdash;merely to think, was to &s;uffer excruciating agony&mdash;yet, never before was <HI>thought</HI> &s;o intru&s;ive&mdash;it haunted her in every &s;pot, in all &s;o|cieties&mdash;&s;leep was no &s;helter&mdash;&s;he never &s;lept but her racking dreams told her&mdash;"&s;he had &s;lain her infant."</P>
<P>They pre&s;ented to her view the naked innocent whom &s;he had longed to pre&s;s
<PB N="141" REF="140">
to her bo&s;om while &s;he lifted up her hand again&s;t its life&mdash;They laid before her the &s;miling babe whom her eye-balls &s;train|ed to behold once more, while her feet hurried her away for ever.</P>
<P>Often had Hannah, by the winter's fire, li&s;tened to tales of gho&s;ts&mdash;of the un|cea&s;ing &s;ting of a guilty con&s;cience&mdash;often had &s;he &s;huddered at the recital of mur|ders&mdash;often had &s;he wept over the &s;tory of the innocent put to death; and &s;tood agha&s;t that the human mind could per|petrate the heinous crime of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination!</P>
<P>From the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t &s;a|vage impul&s;e may ari&s;e&mdash;In the deep re|ce&s;&s;es of fondne&s;s, &s;ometimes is implant|ed the root of cruelty&mdash;and from loving William with unbounded lawle&s;s affecti|on, &s;he found her&s;elf depraved &s;o as to become the very object, that could mo&s;t of all excite her own horror!</P>
<P>Still at delirious intervals, that pa&s;&s;ion, which like a fatal tali&s;man had enchant|ed her whole &s;oul, held out the delu&s;ive pro&s;pect that&mdash;"William might yet re|lent"&mdash;for though &s;he had for ever di&s;|carded the idea of peace, &s;he could not
<PB N="142" REF="141">
force her&s;elf to think, but that again ble&s;t with his &s;ociety &s;he &s;hould, at lea&s;t for the time that he was pre&s;ent, ta&s;te the &s;weet cup of "forgetfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t," for which &s;he &s;o ardently thir&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Should he return to me," &s;he thought in tho&s;e paroxy&s;ms of delu&s;ion, "I would to <HI>him</HI> unbo&s;om all my guilt; and as a remote, a kind of innocent accomplice in my crime, his &s;en&s;e, his arguments, ever ready in making light of my &s;ins, might afford a re&s;pite to my troubled con|&s;cience."</P>
<P>While thus &s;he unwittingly thought, and &s;ometimes watched through the night, &s;tarting with convul&s;ed rapture at every &s;ound, becau&s;e it might po&s;&s;ibly be the harbinger of him; <HI>he</HI> was bu&s;ied in care|fully looking over marriage articles, fix|ing the place of re&s;idence with his de|&s;tined bride, or making love to her in formal proce&s;s.&mdash;Yet, Hannah, vaunt&mdash;he &s;ometimes thought on thee&mdash;he could not witne&s;s the folly, the weakne&s;s, the vanity, the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his future wife, without frequently comparing her with thee. When equivocal words, and pre|varicating
<PB N="143" REF="142">
&s;entences fell from her lips, he remembered with a &s;igh thy candour&mdash;that open &s;incerity which dwelt upon thy tongue, and &s;eemed to vie with thy un|di&s;gui&s;ed features, to charm the li&s;tener even beyond the &s;pectator. While Mi&s;s Sedgeley eagerly gra&s;ped at all the pre|&s;ents he offered, he could not but call to mind that Hannah's declining hand was always clo&s;ed, and her looks forbidding, every time he proffered &s;uch di&s;re&s;pectful tokens of his love." He recollected the &s;oftne&s;s that beamed from Hannah's eyes, the blu&s;h on her face at his approach, while he could never di&s;cern one glance of tenderne&s;s from the niece of Lord Bendham: and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was nearly as di&s;gu&s;ting, as the ill-conducted artifice with which &s;he attempted gentlene&s;s and love.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e impediments were only ob&s;erved as trials of his fortitude&mdash;his prudence could overcome his aver&s;ion, and thus he valued him&s;elf upon his manly firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>'Twas now, that having rid him&s;elf, by Hannah's peevi&s;hne&s;s, mo&s;t honourably
<PB N="144" REF="143">
of all future ties to her; and the day of his marriage with Mi&s;s Sedgeley being fixed, that Henry with the re&s;t of the hou&s;e, learnt, what, to them, was news.&mdash;The fir&s;t dart of Henry's eye upon Wil|liam when, in his pre&s;ence, he was told of it, cau&s;ed a reddening on the face of the latter: he always fancied Henry &s;aw his thoughts, and he knew that Henry in return would give him <HI>his.</HI> On the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, no &s;ooner were they alone, and Henry began to utter them, than William charged him</P>
<P>"Not to dare to proceed; for that, too long accu&s;tomed to trifle, the time was come when &s;erious matters could alone employ his time; and when men of approved &s;en&s;e mu&s;t take place of friends and confidents like him."</P>
<P>Henry replied, "The love, the &s;ince|rity of friends, I thought, were their be&s;t accompli&s;hments; tho&s;e I po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>"But you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s knowledge."</P>
<P>"If that is knowledge which has of late e&s;tranged you from all who bear you a &s;incere affection; which imprints every day more and more upon your features
<PB N="145" REF="144">
the marks of gloomy inquietude, am I not happier in my ignorance?"</P>
<P>"Do not torment me with your inef|fectual rea&s;oning."</P>
<P>"I called at the cottage of poor Han|nah the other day," returned Henry. "Her father and mother were eating their homely meal alone; and when I a&s;ked for their daughter, they wept and &s;aid&mdash;Hannah was not the girl &s;he had been."</P>
<P>William ca&s;t his eyes on the floor.</P>
<P>Henry proceeded&mdash;"They &s;aid a &s;ick|ne&s;s, which they feared would bring her to the grave, had preyed upon her for &s;ome time pa&s;t. They had procured a doctor, but no remedy was found, and they feared the wor&s;t."</P>
<P>"What wor&s;t?" cried William, (now recovered from the effect of the &s;udden intelligence, and attempting a &s;mile) "Do they think &s;he will die? And do you think it will be for love? We do not hear of the&s;e deaths often, Henry."</P>
<P>"And if <HI>&s;he</HI> die, who will hear of <HI>that?</HI> No one but tho&s;e intere&s;ted to conceal the cau&s;e: and thus it is, that dying for love becomes a phenomenon."</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="145">Henry would have pur&s;ued the di&s;|cour&s;e farther, but William, impatient on all &s;ubjects, except where his argu|ment was the better, retired from the con|trover&s;y, crying out "I know my duty, and want no in&s;tructor."</P>
<P>It would be unju&s;t to William to &s;ay, he did not feel for Hannah's reported ill|ne&s;s&mdash;he felt, during that whole evening, and part of the next morning&mdash;but bu&s;i|ne&s;s, plea&s;ures, new occupations, and new &s;chemes of future &s;ucce&s;s, crowded to di&s;&s;ipate all unwelcome reflections: and he tru&s;ted in her youth, her health, her animal &s;pirits, and above all, in the folly of the go&s;&s;ips' &s;tory of <HI>dying for love,</HI> as a &s;urety for her life, and a &s;afeguard for his con&s;cience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE child of William and Hannah was &s;ecreted by Rebecca in her own chamber, a garret, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from where her &s;i&s;ters &s;lept. There &s;he admini&s;tered to all its wants, viewed al|mo&s;t with the joy of a mother its health, its promi&s;ed life; and in a &s;hort time found &s;he loved her little gift, better than any thing on earth, except the giver.</P>
<P>Henry called the next day, and the next, and many &s;ucceeding times, in hopes of an opportunity to &s;peak alone with Rebecca, to enquire concerning her charge, and con&s;ult when, and how, he could privately relieve her from her tru&s;t; as he now meant to procure a nur&s;e for wages. In vain he called or lurked around the hou&s;e&mdash;for near five weeks all the conver&s;ation he could obtain with her was in the company of her &s;i&s;ters, who beginning to ob&s;erve his preference, his marked attention to her, indulged
<PB N="148" REF="147">
their envy and re&s;entment at the con|tempt &s;hown to their charms, by watch|ing her &s;teps when he was away, and her every look and whi&s;per while he was pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>For five weeks, then, he was conti|nually thwarted in his expectation of meeting her alone; and at the end of that period, the whole de&s;ign he had to accompli&s;h by &s;uch a meeting, was ren|dered abortive.</P>
<P>Though Rebecca had every day and night with &s;tricte&s;t caution locked her bed-chamber door, and covered the cre|vices, and every aperture of her room through which &s;ound might more ea&s;ily proceed; though &s;he had &s;urrounded the infant's head with pillows to ob&s;truct all noi&s;e from his crying, yet one unlucky night, the &s;trength of his voice encrea&s;ing with his age, he was heard by the maid who &s;lept in the oppo&s;ite garret.</P>
<P>Not meaning to injure her young mi&s;|tre&s;s, the &s;ervant next morning &s;imply re|lated to the family what &s;ounds had &s;truck her ear during the night; but from what part of the hou&s;e they came, &s;he would
<PB N="149" REF="148">
not undertake directly to &s;ay.&mdash;At fir&s;t &s;he was ridiculed "for &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf awake when in reality &s;he mu&s;t be dream|ing." But &s;tedfa&s;tly per&s;i&s;ting in what &s;he had &s;aid, and Rebecca's confu&s;ion giving much colour to the improbable tale, her chamber was &s;earched by her &s;i&s;ters, the infant di&s;covered, and brought down to their father.</P>
<P>That account which Henry had given Rebecca "of his having found the child," and which her own &s;incerity, joined to the faith &s;he had in his word, made her receive as truth; &s;he now felt would be heard by the pre&s;ent auditors with con|tempt, even with indignation, as a fal&s;e|hood.&mdash;Her affright is better to be con|ceived than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Dragged by her &s;i&s;ters along with the child before the curate, his crim&s;oned face, knit brow, and thundering voice, &s;truck with terror her very &s;oul&mdash;Inno|cence is not always a protection again&s;t fear&mdash;&s;ometimes le&s;s bold than guilt.</P>
<P>In her father and &s;i&s;ters, &s;he &s;aw, &s;he knew the &s;u&s;picious, partial, cruel, boi&s;|terous natures by whom &s;he was to be
<PB N="150" REF="149">
judged; and timid, gentle, oppre&s;&s;ed &s;he fell trembling on her knees, and could only articulate</P>
<P>"Forgive me."</P>
<P>The curate would not li&s;ten to this &s;up|plication till &s;he had replied to his que&s;|tion&mdash;"Who&s;e child is this?"</P>
<P>She replied "I do not know."</P>
<P>Que&s;tioned louder, and with more vio|lence &s;till, "How the child came there, and who&s;e it was?" She felt the impro|bability of the truth &s;till more forcibly than before, and dreaded &s;ome immedi|ate peril from her father's rage, &s;hould &s;he dare to relate an apparent lie&mdash;&s;he pau&s;ed to think upon a more probable tale than the real one&mdash;and as &s;he he&s;itat|ed, &s;hook in every limb&mdash;while her fa|ther exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand the cau&s;e of this ter|ror!&mdash;From your infancy I have predict|ed that &s;ome fatal cata&s;trophe would be|fall you&mdash;I never loved you like my other children&mdash;I never had the cau&s;e&mdash;you were always unlike the re&s;t&mdash;and I knew your &s;ate would be calamitous&mdash;but the very wor&s;t of my fore-bodings did not
<PB N="151" REF="150">
come to this&mdash;&s;o young, &s;o guilty, and &s;o artful!&mdash;tell me this in&s;tant, are you mar|ried?"</P>
<P>Rebecca an&s;wered, "No."</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters lifted up their hands!</P>
<P>The father continued&mdash;"Vile pro&s;ti|tute, I thought as much.&mdash;Still I will know the father of this child."</P>
<P>She ca&s;t up her eyes to heaven, and firmly vowed &s;he "did not know her|&s;elf&mdash;nor who the mother was."</P>
<P>"This is not to be borne!" exclaim|ed the curate in fury. "Per&s;i&s;t in this, and you never &s;ee my face again. Both your child and you I'll turn out of my hou&s;e in&s;tantly, unle&s;s you confe&s;s your crime, and own the father."</P>
<P>Curious to know this &s;ecret, the &s;i&s;|ters went up to Rebecca with &s;eeming kindne&s;s, and&mdash;"Conjured her to &s;pare her father &s;till greater grief, and her own and her child's public infamy, by ac|knowledging her&s;elf its mother; and naming the man who had &s;educed her."</P>
<P>Emboldened by this in&s;ult from her own &s;ex, Rebecca now began to declare the &s;imple truth.&mdash;But no &s;ooner had &s;he
<PB N="152" REF="151">
&s;aid that&mdash;"The child was the gift of a young man who had found it&mdash;" than her &s;i&s;ters bur&s;t into laughter, and her fa|ther into fre&s;h fits of rage.</P>
<P>Once more the women offered their advice&mdash;"To confe&s;s and be forgiven."</P>
<P>Once more the father raved.</P>
<P>Beguiled by &s;olicitations, and terrified by threats, &s;he at length felt inclined to take the mother's &s;hare of the infant, but was at a lo&s;s to whom to give the father's. She thought that Henry had entailed on him&s;elf the be&s;t right to the charge; but &s;he loved him, and could not bear the idea of accu&s;ing him fal&s;ely.</P>
<P>While, with agitation in the extreme, &s;he thus deliberated, the propo&s;ition again was put</P>
<P>"Whether &s;he would tru&s;t to the mer|cy of her father by confe&s;&s;ing, or draw down his immediate vengeance by deny|ing her guilt?"</P>
<P>She made choice of the former&mdash;and with tears and &s;obs "Owned her&s;elf the mother of the boy."</P>
<P>But &s;till&mdash;"Who is the father?"</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="152">Again &s;he &s;hrunk from the que&s;tion, and fervently implored&mdash;"To be &s;pared on that point."</P>
<P>Her petition was rejected with vehe|mence; and the curate's rage encrea&s;ed till &s;he acknowledged</P>
<P>"Henry was the father."</P>
<P>"I thought &s;o." Exclaimed all her &s;i&s;ters at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>"Villain!" cried the curate. "The dean &s;hall know, before this hour is ex|pired, the ba&s;ene&s;s of the nephew whom he &s;upports upon charity: he &s;hall know the mi&s;ery, the grief, the &s;hame he has brought upon me, and know how un|worthy he is of his protection."</P>
<P>"Oh! have mercy on him!" cried Rebecca as &s;he &s;till knelt to her father: "Do not ruin him with his uncle, for he is the be&s;t of creatures."</P>
<P>"Ay, ay, we always &s;aw how much &s;he loved him." Cried her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>"Wicked, undone girl!" &s;aid the cler|gyman (his rage now &s;ub&s;iding, and tears &s;upplying its place) "you have drawn a cur&s;e upon us all&mdash;your &s;i&s;ters' reputati|on will be &s;tampt with the colour of
<PB N="154" REF="153">
yours&mdash;my good name will &s;uffer&mdash;but that is trivial&mdash;your &s;oul is lo&s;t to vir|tue, to religion, to &s;hame&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No <HI>indeed</HI>;" cried Rebecca, "If you will but believe me."</P>
<P>"Do not I believe you? Have not you confe&s;&s;ed?"</P>
<P>"You would not pretend to un&s;ay what you have &s;aid:" cried her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, "that would be making things wor&s;e."</P>
<P>"Go, go out of my &s;ight:" &s;aid her fa|ther. "Take your child with you to your chamber, and never let me &s;ee ei|ther of you again.&mdash;I do not turn you out of my doors to day, becau&s;e I gave you my word I would not if you reveal|ed your &s;hame&mdash;but by to-morrow I will provide &s;ome place for your reception, where neither I, nor any of your relati|ons, &s;hall ever &s;ee or hear of you more."</P>
<P>Rebecca made an effort to cling around her father, and once more to declare her innocence: but her &s;i&s;ters interpo&s;ed, and &s;he was taken, with her reputed &s;on, to the chamber where the curate had &s;entenced her to remain, till &s;he quitted his hou&s;e for ever.</P>

<P>THE curate, in the &s;oldier of his mind, &s;carce felt the ground he trod as he ha&s;t|ed to the dean's to complain of his wrongs. His name procured him immediate ad|mittance into the library&mdash;and the mo|ment the dean appeared, the curate bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;The cau&s;e being required of &s;uch "very &s;ingular marks of grief," Mr. Rymer de&s;cribed him&s;elf, "as having been a few months ago the happie&s;t of parents, but that his peace and that of his whole family had been de&s;troyed by Mr. Henry Norwynne, the dean's ne|phew."</P>
<P>He now entered into a minute recital of Henry's frequent vi&s;its there, and of all that had occurred in his hou&s;e that morning, from the &s;u&s;picion that a child was concealed under his roof, to the con|fe&s;&s;ion made by his younge&s;t daughter of her fall from virtue, and of her betray|er's name.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="155">The dean was a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;hocked, and rouzed to anger: he vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew; and, "ble&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf in a virtuous &s;on, who&s;e wi&s;dom and coun&s;el were his only &s;olace in every care," &s;ent for William to com|municate with him on the unhappy &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>William came, all obedience, and heard with marks of amazement and indignati|on the account of &s;uch black villany! In perfect &s;ympathy with Mr. Rymor and his father, he allowed no "puni&s;hment could be too great for the &s;educer of in|nocence, the &s;elfi&s;h invader of a whole family's repo&s;e."</P>
<P>Nor did William here &s;peak what he did not think&mdash;he merely forgot his own conduct; or if he did recal it to his mind, it was with &s;ome fair interpretation in his own behalf; &s;uch as &s;elf-love ever &s;up|plies to tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to cheat their con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Young Henry being &s;ent for to appear before this triumvirate, he came with a light &s;tep and a chearful face. But, on the charge again&s;t him being exhibited,
<PB N="157" REF="156">
his countenance changed&mdash;yet only to the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e! He boldly a&s;|&s;erted his innocence, plainly told the real fact; and with a deportment &s;o perfectly unembarra&s;&s;ed, that nothing but the a&s;&s;e|verations of the curate, "that his daugh|ter had confe&s;&s;ed the whole," could have rendered the &s;tory Henry told &s;u&s;pected; although &s;ome of the incidents he related were of no common kind. But Mr. Rymer's charge was an objection to his veracity, too potent to be overcome; and the dean exclaimed, in rage&mdash;</P>
<P>"We want not your avowal of your guilt&mdash;the mother's evidence is te&s;timony &s;ufficient."</P>
<P>"The virtuous Rebecca is not a mo|ther." Said Henry, with firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>William here, like Rebecca's &s;i&s;ters, took Henry a&s;ide, and warned him not to "Add to his offence by denying what was proved again&s;t him."</P>
<P>But Henry's &s;pirit was too manly, his affection too &s;incere, not to vindicate the cha&s;tity of her he loved, even at his own peril. He again and again prote&s;ted "&s;he was virtuous."</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">"Let her in&s;tantly be &s;ent for," &s;aid the dean, "and this madman confronted with her." Then, adding, that as he wi&s;hed every thing might be conducted with &s;ecrecy, he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occa&s;ion; he de|&s;ired William to draw up the form of an oath, which he would admini&s;ter as &s;oon as &s;he arrived.</P>
<P>A man and hor&s;e were immediately di&s;patched to bring Rebecca; William drew up an affidavit as his father had directed him&mdash;<HI>in Rebecca's name, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting &s;he was a mother, and Henry, the father of her child</HI>&mdash;and now, the dean, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing till &s;he came the warmth of his anger, &s;poke thus calmly to Henry:</P>
<P>"Even &s;uppo&s;ing that your improbable tale of having found this child, and all your declarations in re&s;pect to it were true, &s;till you would be greatly criminal: what plea can you make for not having immediately revealed the circum&s;tance to me or &s;ome other proper per&s;on, that the real mother might be detected and pu|ni&s;hed for her de&s;ign of murder?"</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="158">"In that perhaps I was to blame:" returned Henry: "but whoever the mo|ther was, I pitied her."</P>
<P>"Compa&s;&s;ion on &s;uch an occa&s;ion was ill placed." Said the dean.</P>
<P>"Was I wrong, Sir, to pity the child?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Then how could I feel for <HI>that,</HI> and yet dive&s;t my&s;elf of all feeling for its mother?"</P>
<P>"Its mother!" (exclaimed William, in anger) "She ought to have been im|mediately pur&s;ued, apprehended, and committed to pri&s;on."</P>
<P>"It &s;truck me, cou&s;in William," re|plied Henry, "that the father was mo&s;t de&s;erving a pri&s;on: the poor woman had abandoned only <HI>one</HI>&mdash;the man, in all likelihood, had for&s;aken <HI>two.</HI>"</P>
<P>William was pouring execrations "on the villain, if &s;uch there could be," when Rebecca was announced.</P>
<P>Her eyes were half-clo&s;ed with weep|ing; deep confu&s;ion over&s;pread her face; and her tottering limbs could hardly &s;up|port her to the awful chamber where the dean, her father, and William &s;at in

<P>Upon her entrance, her father fir&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;ed her, and &s;aid in a &s;tern, threaten|ing, yet feeling tone, "Unhappy girl, an&s;wer me before all pre&s;ent&mdash;Have you, or have you not, owned your&s;elf a mother?"</P>
<P>She replied, &s;tealing a fearful look at Henry,&mdash;"I have."</P>
<P>"And have you not," a&s;ked the dean, "owned that Henry Norwynne is the father of your child?"</P>
<P>She &s;eemed as if &s;he wi&s;hed to expo&s;|tulate&mdash;</P>
<P>The curate rai&s;ed his voice&mdash;"Have you, or have you not?"</P>
<P>"I have," &s;he faintly replied.</P>
<P>"Then here," cried the dean to Wil|liam, "read that paper to her, and take the Bible."</P>
<P>William read the paper, which in her name declared a momentous fal&s;ehood: he then held the book in form, while &s;he looked like one di&s;tracted&mdash;wrung her hands, and was near &s;inking to the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="160">At the moment the book was lifted up to her lips to ki&s;s, Henry ru&s;hed to her&mdash;"Stop," he cried, "Rebecca; do not hurt your future peace; do not be ter|rified into the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime which hereafter will di&s;tract your deli|cate con&s;cience. My confe&s;&s;ion will be a te&s;timony equal to your oath&mdash;will render it needle&s;s&mdash;and here I acknow|ledge that all you have a&s;&s;erted is truth."</P>
<P>"Surpri&s;ing audacity!&mdash;Complicated villany!" exclaimed the dean&mdash;then ad|ded, "Henry Norwynne, your fir&s;t guilt is &s;o enormous; your &s;econd, in &s;tedfa&s;tly denying it, &s;o ba&s;e; this la&s;t conduct &s;o unaccountable! That from the pre&s;ent hour you mu&s;t never dare to call me relation, or to con&s;ider my hou&s;e as your home."</P>
<P>William, in uni&s;on with his father, ex|claimed, "Indeed, Henry, your actions merit this puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>Henry an&s;wered with firmne&s;s, "Inflict what puni&s;hment you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"With the dean's permi&s;&s;ion then," &s;aid the curate) "you mu&s;t marry my daughter."</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="161">Henry &s;tarted&mdash;"Marry her! Marry Rebecca! Do you pronounce that as a puni&s;hment? It would be the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing providence could be&s;tow.&mdash;But how are we to live? My uncle is too much offended ever to be my friend again; and in this country, people of a certain cla&s;s are &s;o educated they cannot exi&s;t without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or what is called the patronage, of others; when that is with-held they &s;teal or &s;tarve. Heaven protect Rebecca from &s;uch mis|fortune!&mdash;Sir, (to the curate) do you but con&s;ent to &s;upport her a year or two lon|ger, and in that time I will learn &s;ome occupation that &s;hall rai&s;e me to the emi|nence of maintaining both her and my|&s;elf without one obligation, or one in|convenience to another."</P>
<P>Rebecca exclaimed, "Oh! you have &s;aved me from &s;uch a weight of &s;in, that my future life would be too happy pa&s;&s;ed as your &s;lave."</P>
<P>"No, my dear Rebecca, return to your father's hou&s;e, return to &s;lavery but for a few years more, and the re&s;t of your life I will make free."</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162">"And can you forgive me?"</P>
<P>"I can love you; and in that is com|pri&s;ed every thing that is kind."</P>
<P>The curate, who, bating a few pa&s;|&s;ions and a few prejudices, was a man of &s;ome worth and feeling, had felt, in the mid&s;t of her di&s;tre&s;s, though the re|&s;ult of crimes, that he loved this ne|glected daughter better than he had be|fore conceived; and he now agreed "to take her home for a time, provided &s;he were relieved from the child, and the matter &s;o hu&s;hed up, that it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other daughters.</P>
<P>The dean did not degrade his con&s;e|quence by con&s;ultations of this nature; but, having penetrated (as he imagined) into the very bottom of this intricate &s;tory, and i&s;&s;ued his mandate again&s;t Henry&mdash;as a mark that he took no far|ther concern in the matter, he proudly walked out of the room without uttering another word.</P>
<P>William as proudly, and as &s;ilently followed.</P>
<P>The curate was inclined to adopt the
<PB N="164" REF="163">
manners of &s;uch great examples&mdash;but, &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;ome affection to Rebecca, and concern for the character of his fa|mily, made him wi&s;h to talk a little more with Henry; who now repeated what he had &s;aid re&s;pecting his marriage with Re|becca, and promi&s;ed "to come the very next day in &s;ecret, and deliver her from the care of the infant, and the &s;u&s;picion that would attend her nur&s;ing it."</P>
<P>"But above all," &s;aid the curate, "procure your uncle's pardon; for with|out that, without his protection, or the protection of &s;ome other rich man; to marry, to obey God's ordinance, <HI>increa&s;e and multiply,</HI> is to want food for your&s;elf and your offspring."</P>

<P>THOUGH this unfortunate occur|rence in the curate's family was, accord|ing to his own phra&s;e, "to be hu&s;hed up," yet certain per&s;ons of his, of the dean's, and of Lord Bendham's hou&s;e, immediately heard and talked of it. Among the&s;e, Lady Bendham was mo&s;t of all &s;hocked and offended; &s;he "ne|ver could bear to hear Mr. Rymer either pray or preach again&mdash;he had not con|ducted him&s;elf with proper dignity either as a clergyman or a father&mdash;he &s;hould have imitated the dean's example in re|&s;pect to Henry, and have turned his daughter out of doors."</P>
<P>Lord Bendham was le&s;s &s;evere on the &s;educed, but had no mercy on the &s;e|ducer&mdash;"a vicious youth, without one accompli&s;hment to endear vice"&mdash;For vice Lord Bendham thought (with &s;ome philo&s;ophers) might be mo&s;t exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing, in a plea&s;ing garb. "But this
<PB N="166" REF="165">
youth &s;inned without elegance, without one particle of wit, or an atom of good breeding."</P>
<P>Lady Clementina would not permit the &s;ubject to be mentioned a &s;econd time in her hearing&mdash;extreme delicacy in woman &s;he knew was bewitching; and the de|licacy &s;he di&s;played on this occa&s;ion went &s;o far that &s;he "could not even inter|cede with the dean to forgive his nephew, becau&s;e the topic was too gro&s;s for her lips to name even in the ear of her hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Sedgeley, though on the very eve of her bridal day with William, felt &s;o tender a regard for Henry, that often &s;he thought "Rebecca happier in di&s;grace and poverty, ble&s;t with the love of him, than &s;he was likely to be in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of friends and fortune with his cou&s;in."</P>
<P>Had Henry been of a nature to &s;u&s;pect others of evil, or had he felt a confidence in his own worth, &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as this young woman's would &s;oon have di&s;clo&s;ed its exi&s;tence: but he, regardle&s;s of any attractions of Mi&s;s Sedgeley, equally &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="167" REF="166">
he had none in her eyes; and thus, fortunately for the peace of all parties, this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ever remained a &s;ecret except to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>So little did William conceive that his clowni&s;h cou&s;in could rival him in the af|fections of a woman of fa&s;hion, that he even &s;lightly &s;olicited his father "that Henry might not be bani&s;hed from the hou&s;e, at lea&s;t till after the following day, when the great fe&s;tival of his marriage was to be celebrated."</P>
<P>But the dean refu&s;ed; and reminded his &s;on, "That he was bound both by his moral and religious character, in the eyes of God, and &s;till more, in the eyes of men, to &s;hew la&s;ting re&s;entment of iniquity like his."</P>
<P>William acquie&s;ced, and immediately delivered his cou&s;in the dean's "wi&s;hes for his amendment," and a letter of re|commendation procured from Lord Bend|ham, to introduce him on board a man of war; where, he was told, "he might hope to meet with preferment according to his merit as a &s;ailor and a gentleman."</P>
<P>Henry pre&s;&s;ed William's hand on part|ing
<PB N="168" REF="167">
&mdash;wi&s;hed him happy in his marriage&mdash;and &s;upplicated, as the only favour he would implore, an interview with his uncle&mdash;to thank him for all his former kindne&s;s, and &s;ee him for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>William repeated this petition to his father, but with &s;o little energy, that the dean did not grant it. He felt him&s;elf compelled to re&s;ent that reprobate cha|racter in which Henry had appeared; and he feared&mdash;"le&s;t the remembrance of his la&s;t parting from his brother might, on taking a formal leave of that brother's &s;on, reduce him to &s;ome tokens of weak|ne&s;s, that would ill-become his dignity and ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>He &s;ent him his ble&s;&s;ing, with money to convey him to his &s;hip&mdash;and Henry quitted his uncle's hou&s;e in a flood of tears, to &s;eek fir&s;t a new protectre&s;s for his little &s;oundling, and then to &s;eek his fortune.</P>

<P>THE wedding day of Mr. William Norwynne with Mi&s;s Caroline Sedgeley arrived&mdash;and on that day, the bells of every pari&s;h &s;urrounding that in which they lived, joined with their own, in ce|lebration of the bli&s;sful union. Flowers were &s;trewed before the new-married pair, and favours and ale made many a heart more glad&s;ome, than that of either bride|groom or bride.</P>
<P>Upon this day of ringing and rejoic|ing, the bells were not muffled, nor was conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject withheld from the ear of Hannah! She heard like her neighbours; and &s;itting on the &s;ide of her bed in her little chamber, &s;uffered, under the cottage roof, as much affliction as ever vi&s;ited a palace.</P>
<P>Tyrants, who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads of their fellow creatures, can call their murders "religion, ju&s;tice, attention to the good
<PB N="170" REF="169">
of mankind"&mdash;poor Hannah knew no &s;ophi&s;try to calm <HI>her</HI> con&s;cience&mdash;&s;he felt her&s;elf a harlot and a murderer&mdash;a &s;lighted, a de&s;erted wretch, bereft of all &s;he loved in this world, all &s;he could hope for in the next.</P>
<P>She complained bitterly of illne&s;s, nor could the entreaties of her father and mother prevail on her to &s;hare in the &s;ports of this general holiday.&mdash;As none of her humble vi&s;itors &s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e of her more than ordinary indi&s;po&s;ition, they endeavoured to divert it with an ac|count of every thing they had &s;een at church&mdash;"What the bride wore, how joyful the bridegroom looked: and all the little &s;igns of that complete happine&s;s, which they conceived was for certain ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Hannah, who, before this event, had at moments &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the agoni&s;ing &s;ting of guilt, in the faint pro&s;pect of her lover one day re&s;tored; on this memor|able occa&s;ion lo&s;t every glimp&s;e of hope, and was weighed to the earth with an ac|cumulation of de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="170">Where is the degree in which the &s;inner &s;tops? Unhappy Hannah! the fir&s;t time you permitted indecorous fami|liarity from a man who made you no promi&s;e, who gave you no hope of be|coming his wife, who profe&s;t nothing beyond tho&s;e fervent, though &s;lender, affections which attach the rake to the wanton&mdash;the fir&s;t time you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers, into tenderne&s;s and con&s;tancy&mdash;the fir&s;t time you de&s;cended from the character of pu|rity, you ru&s;hed imperceptibly on the blacke&s;t crimes. The more &s;incerely you loved, the more you plunged in danger&mdash;from one ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion proceeded a &s;econd and a third. In the fervency of affection, you yielded up your virtue!&mdash;In the exce&s;s of fear, you &s;tained your con&s;cience, by the intended murder of your child!&mdash;and now, in the violence of grief, you meditate&mdash;what?&mdash;to put an end to your exi&s;tence by your own hand!</P>
<P>After ca&s;ting her thoughts around, anxious to find &s;ome little bud of comfort on which to fix her longing eye; &s;he be|held,
<PB N="172" REF="171">
in the total lo&s;s of William, nothing but a wide wa&s;te, an exten&s;ive plain of angui&s;h.&mdash;"How am I to be &s;u&s;tained through this dreary journey of life?" &s;he exclaimed.&mdash;Upon this que&s;tion &s;he felt more poignantly than ever, her lo&s;s of innocence&mdash;innocence would have been her &s;upport&mdash;but, in place of this be&s;t prop to the afflicted, guilt fla&s;hed on her memory every time &s;he flew for aid to re|flection.</P>
<P>At length, from horrible rumination, a momentary alleviation came&mdash;"But one more &s;tep in wickedne&s;s," &s;he tri|umphantly &s;aid, "and all my &s;hame, all my &s;ufferings are over." She congratu|lated her&s;elf upon the lucky thought&mdash;when, but an in&s;tant after, the tears trickled down her face for the &s;orrow her death, her &s;inful death, would bring to her poor, and beloved parents.&mdash;She then thought upon the probability of a &s;igh it might draw from William; and the pride, the plea&s;ure of that little tri|bute, counterpoi&s;ed every &s;truggle on the &s;ide of life.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aw the &s;un decline, "When you ri&s;e again," &s;he thought, "when
<PB N="173" REF="172">
you peep bright to-morrow morning into this little room to call me up, I &s;hall not be here to open my eyes upon a hateful day&mdash;I &s;hall no more regret that you have waked me!&mdash;I &s;hall be &s;ound a&s;leep, never to wake again in this wretched world&mdash;not even the voice of William would then awake me.</P>
<P>While &s;he found her&s;elf re&s;olved, and evening ju&s;t come on, &s;he hurried out of the hou&s;e, and ha&s;tened to the fatal wood; the &s;cene of her di&s;honour&mdash;the &s;cene of meditated murder&mdash;and now, the in|tended &s;cene of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>As &s;he walked along between the clo&s;e|&s;et trees, &s;he &s;aw at a little di&s;tance, the &s;pot where William fir&s;t made love to her; and where, at every appointment, he u&s;ed to wait her coming. She darted her eye away from this place with horror&mdash;but, after a few moments of emotion, &s;he walked &s;lowly up to it&mdash;&s;hed tears, and pre&s;&s;ed with her trembling lips that tree, again&s;t which he was accu&s;tomed to lean while he talked to her.&mdash;She felt an inclination to make this the &s;pot to die in&mdash;but her preconcerted, and the le&s;s
<PB N="174" REF="173">
frightful death, of throwing her&s;elf into a pool on the other &s;ide of the wood, in|duced her to go onwards.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, &s;he came near the place where her child, and William's, was ex|po&s;ed to peri&s;h.&mdash;Here, &s;he &s;tarted with a &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t atrocious guilt; and her whole frame &s;hook with the dread of an approaching, an omnipotent judge to &s;entence her for murder.</P>
<P>She halted, appalled! Agha&s;t! Unde|termined whether to exi&s;t longer beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of a criminal con&s;cience, or die that very hour and meet her final condemnation.</P>
<P>She proceeded a few &s;teps farther, and beheld the very ivy-bu&s;h clo&s;e to which her infant lay, when &s;he left him ex|po&s;ed&mdash;and now, from this minute re|collection, all the mother ri&s;ing in her &s;oul, &s;he &s;aw, as it were, her babe again in its de&s;erted &s;tate; and, bur&s;ting into tears of bittere&s;t contrition and compa&s;|&s;ion, &s;he cried</P>
<P>"As I was mercile&s;s to <HI>thee,</HI> my child, thy father has been pitile&s;s to <HI>me!</HI> As I abandoned <HI>thee</HI> to die with cold and
<PB N="175" REF="174">
hunger, he has for&s;aken, and has driven <HI>me</HI> to die by &s;elf-murder."</P>
<P>She now fixed her eager eyes on the di&s;tant pond, and walked more nimbly than before, to rid her&s;elf of her ago|ni&s;ing &s;en&s;e!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he had nearly reached the wi&s;hed-for brink, &s;he heard a foot&s;tep, and &s;aw, by the glimmering of a clouded moon, a man approaching. She turned out of her path for fear her intentions &s;hould be gue&s;&s;ed at, and thwarted; but &s;till as &s;he walked another way, her eye was wi&s;hfully bent towards the water that was to obliterate her love and her re|mor&s;e&mdash;obliterate for ever, William and his child.</P>
<P>It was now, that Henry&mdash;who, to pre|vent &s;candal, had &s;tolen at that &s;till hour of night to rid the curate of the incum|brance &s;o irk&s;ome to him, and take the foundling to a woman whom he had hired for the charge&mdash;it was now that Henry came up, with the child of Hannah in his arms, carefully covered all over from night's dew.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="175">"Hannah, is it you?" (cried Henry, at a little di&s;tance) "Where are you going thus late?"</P>
<P>"Home, Sir." Said &s;he, and ru&s;hed among the trees.</P>
<P>"Stop, Hannah," he cried, "I want to bid you farewell&mdash;to-morrow I am going to leave this part of the country for a long time&mdash;So God ble&s;s you, Hannah!" Saying this, he &s;tretched out his arm to &s;hake her by the hand.</P>
<P>Her poor heart tru&s;ting that his ble&s;&s;ing, for want of more potent offerings, might perhaps, at this tremendous cri&s;is, a&s;cend to heaven in her behalf: &s;he &s;topt, re|turned, and put out her hand to take his.</P>
<P>"Softly," &s;aid he, "don't wake my child&mdash;this &s;pot has been a place of dan|ger for him&mdash;for underneath this very ivy-bu&s;h it was that I found him."</P>
<P>"Found what?" Cried Hannah, with a voice elevated to a tremulous &s;cream.</P>
<P>"I will not tell you, replied Henry, "for no one I have ever yet told of it, would believe me."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="176">"I will believe you. I will believe you." She repeated with tones yet more impre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>"Why then," &s;aid Henry, "only five weeks ago&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;hrieked Hannah.</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" Said Henry.</P>
<P>"Go on." She articulated, in the &s;ame voice.</P>
<P>"Why then, as I was pa&s;&s;ing this very place, I wi&s;h I may never &s;peak truth again, if I did not find"&mdash;here he pulled a&s;ide the warm rug in which the infant was wrapt&mdash;"this beautiful child."</P>
<P>"With a cord?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"A cord was round its neck."</P>
<P>"'Tis mine&mdash;the child is mine&mdash;'tis mine&mdash;my child&mdash;I am the mother and the murderer&mdash;I fixed the cord, while the ground &s;hook under me&mdash;while fla&s;hes of fire darted before my eyes!&mdash;while my heart was bur&s;ting with de&s;pair and horror.&mdash;But I &s;topt &s;hort&mdash;I did not draw the noo&s;e&mdash;I had a moment of &s;trength, and I ran away. I left him living&mdash;he is living now&mdash;e&s;caped from my hands&mdash;and I am no longer a&s;hamed,
<PB N="178" REF="177">
but overcome with joy that he is mine! I ble&s;s you, my dear, for &s;aving his life&mdash;for giving him to me again&mdash;for pre&s;erv|ing my life, as well as my child's."</P>
<P>Here &s;he took her infant, pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips and to her bo&s;om; then bent to the ground, cla&s;ped Henry's knees, and wept upon his feet.</P>
<P>He could not for a moment doubt the truth of what &s;he &s;aid&mdash;her powerful, yet broken accents, her convul&s;ive &s;tarts, even more than her declaration, con|vinced him.</P>
<P>She now ro&s;e from the earth in ha&s;te, and &s;tealing quick on one &s;ide, po&s;tponed farther gratitude to Henry, for the per|formance of the mo&s;t endearing office of a mother. The child greedily received from her bo&s;om the food till then un|ta&s;ted&mdash;and on this, feeling more exqui|&s;itely the tender, the proud prerogative of a maternal parent, &s;he uttered with &s;ighs of tran&s;port,</P>
<P>"Now I am as rich, as happy as your father&mdash;as ble&s;t as his bride!&mdash;for I ex|perience the joy of a con&s;cience relieved from a deadly weight&mdash;and I have &s;ome|thing
<PB N="179" REF="178">
to love&mdash;&s;omething on which to pour that fund of affection which he re|jects."</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" cried Henry, "and this is my cou&s;in William's child!"</P>
<P>"But your cou&s;in does not know it." Said &s;he. "I never told him&mdash;he was not kind enough to embolden me&mdash;therefore do not blame <HI>him</HI> for <HI>my</HI> &s;in&mdash;he did not know of my wicked de&s;igns&mdash;he did not encourage me&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But he for&s;ook you, Hannah."</P>
<P>"He never &s;aid he would not. He always told me he could not marry me."</P>
<P>"Did he tell you &s;o at his fir&s;t private meeting?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Nor at the &s;econd?"</P>
<P>"No, nor yet at the third."</P>
<P>"When was it he told you &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I forget the exact time&mdash;but I re|member it was on that very evening when I confe&s;t to him&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"That he had won my heart."</P>
<P>"Why did you confe&s;s it?"</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="179">"Becau&s;e he a&s;ked me, and &s;aid it would make him happy if I would &s;ay &s;o."</P>
<P>"Cruel! di&s;honourable!"</P>
<P>"Nay, do not blame him&mdash;he cannot help <HI>not</HI> loving me, no more than I can help, <HI>loving</HI> him."</P>
<P>Henry rubbed his eyes.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, you weep!&mdash;I always heard that you were brought up in a &s;a|vage country; but I &s;uppo&s;e it is a mi&s;|take; it was your cou&s;in William."</P>
<P>"Will not you apply to him for the &s;upport of your child?" A&s;ked Henry.</P>
<P>"If I thought he would not be an|gry."</P>
<P>"Angry!&mdash;I will write to him on the &s;ubject, if you will give me leave."</P>
<P>"But do not &s;ay it is by my de&s;ire. Do not &s;ay I wi&s;h to trouble him&mdash;I would &s;ooner beg, than be a trouble to him."</P>
<P>"Why are you &s;o delicate?"</P>
<P>"It is for my own &s;ake&mdash;I wi&s;h him not to hate me."</P>
<P>"Then, thus you may &s;ecure his re|&s;pect&mdash;I will write to him, and let him
<PB N="181" REF="180">
know all the circum&s;tances of your ca&s;e; I will plead for his compa&s;&s;ion on his child, but a&s;&s;ure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare (ex|cept only to me, who knew of your pre|vious acquaintance) who is the father."</P>
<P>To this Hannah con&s;ented: but when Henry offered to take from her the infant and carry him to the nur&s;e he had engag|ed; to this &s;he would not con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"Do you mean then to acknowledge him yours?" Henry a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"Nothing &s;hall force me to part from him. I will keep him, and let my neigh|bours judge of me as they plea&s;e."</P>
<P>Here Henry caught at a hope he fear|ed to name before. "You will then have no objection," &s;aid he, "to clear an unhappy girl to a few friends with whom her character has &s;uffered by be|coming, at my reque&s;t, his nur&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t gladly. I will clear any one &s;o that I do not accu&s;e the father."</P>
<P>"You give me leave, then, in your name, to tell the whole &s;tory to &s;ome par|ticular friends, my cou&s;in William's part in it alone excepted?"</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="181">"I do."</P>
<P>"Henry now cried "God ble&s;s you!" with greater fervour than when he &s;poke it before&mdash;and he hoped the nig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was nearly gone, that the time might be &s;o much the &s;horter before Rebecca &s;hould be rein&s;tated in the e&s;teem of her father, and of all tho&s;e who had misjudged her.</P>
<P>"God ble&s;s <HI>you!</HI>" &s;aid Hannah &s;till more fervently, as &s;he walked with un|guided &s;teps towards her home; for her eyes never wandered from the precious object that cau&s;ed her unexpected return.</P>

<P>HENRY ro&s;e early in the morning and flew to the curate's hou&s;e, with more than even his u&s;ual thir&s;t of ju&s;tice, to clear-injured innocence, to redeem from &s;hame, her whom he loved. With eager ha&s;te he told&mdash;that he had &s;ound the mother, who&s;e fall from virtue Rebecca, over|come by confu&s;ion and threats, had taken on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Rebecca rejoiced&mdash;but her &s;i&s;ters &s;hook their heads&mdash;and even the father &s;eemed to doubt.</P>
<P>Confident in the truth of his &s;tory, Henry per&s;i&s;ted &s;o boldly in his affirma|tions, that if Mr. Rymer did not entirely believe what he &s;aid, he &s;ecretly hoped the dean and other people might; there|fore he began to imagine, he could po&s;|&s;ibly &s;hake from <HI>his</HI> family the pre&s;ent &s;tigma, whether or no it belonged to any other.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Henry gone, than Mr. Rymer waited on the dean to report what
<PB N="184" REF="183">
he had heard; and he frankly attributed his daughter's fal&s;e confe&s;&s;ion, to the com|pul&s;ive methods he had adopted in charg|ing her with the offence: upon this &s;tate|ment, Henry's love to her was al&s;o a &s;o|lution of his incon&s;i&s;tent conduct on that &s;ingular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The dean immediately &s;aid&mdash;"he would put the matter beyond all doubt: for he would that moment &s;end for the pre&s;ent reputed mother; and if &s;he ac|knowledged the child, he would in&s;tantly commit her to pri&s;on for the attempt of putting it to death.</P>
<P>The curate applauded the dean's &s;a|gacity; a warrant was i&s;&s;ued; and Han|nah brought pri&s;oner before the grandfa|ther of her child.</P>
<P>She appeared a&s;toni&s;hed at the peril in which &s;he found her&s;elf! Confu&s;ed al&s;o, with a thou&s;and inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;a|tions which the dean's pre&s;ence in&s;pired, &s;he &s;eemed to prevaricate in all &s;he utter|ed.&mdash;Accu&s;ed of this, &s;he was &s;till more di&s;concerted&mdash;&s;aid, and un&s;aid&mdash;confe&s;&s;|ed her&s;elf the mother of the infant, but declared &s;he did not know&mdash;then owned
<PB N="185" REF="184">
&s;he <HI>did</HI> know the name of the man who had undone her, but would never utter it.&mdash;At length, &s;he ca&s;t her&s;elf on her knees before the father of her betrayer, and &s;upplicated "he would not puni&s;h her with &s;everity, as &s;he mo&s;t penitently confe&s;&s;ed her fault, &s;o far as it related to her&s;elf."</P>
<P>While Mr. and Mrs. Norwynne, ju&s;t entered on the honey-moon, were &s;itting &s;ide by &s;ide enjoying with peace and with honour conjugal &s;ociety; poor Han|nah, threatened, reviled, and &s;inking to the du&s;t, was hearing from the mouth of William's father, the enormity of tho&s;e crimes to which his &s;on had been acce&s;|&s;ary.&mdash;She &s;aw the mittimus written that was to convey her into a pri&s;on&mdash;&s;aw her&s;elf delivered once more into the hands of con&s;tables, before her re&s;olution of concealing the name of William in her &s;tory left her.&mdash;She now, overcome with affright, and thinking &s;he &s;hould expo&s;e him &s;till more in a public court, if here|after on her trial &s;he &s;hould be obliged to name him&mdash;&s;he now humbly a&s;ked the dean to hear a few words &s;he had to &s;ay
<PB N="186" REF="185">
in private&mdash;where &s;he promi&s;ed &s;he "would &s;peak nothing but the truth."</P>
<P>This was impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;aid&mdash;"No private confe&s;&s;ions before a magi&s;trate! All mu&s;t be done openly."</P>
<P>She urged again and again the &s;ame re|que&s;t&mdash;it was denied more peremptorily than at fir&s;t. On which &s;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Then, Sir, forgive me, &s;ince you force me to it, if I &s;peak before Mr. Rymer and tho&s;e men, what I would for ever have kept a &s;ecret if I could.&mdash;One of your family is my child's father."</P>
<P>"Any of my &s;ervants?" cried the dean.</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"My nephew?"</P>
<P>"No; one who is nearer &s;till."</P>
<P>"Come this way," &s;aid the dean, "I <HI>will</HI> &s;peak to you in private.</P>
<P>It was not that the dean, as a magi|&s;trate, di&s;tributed partial decrees of pre|tended ju&s;tice&mdash;he was rigidly faithful to his tru&s;t&mdash;he would not inflict puni&s;h|ment on the innocent, or let the guilty e&s;cape&mdash;but in all particulars of refined or coar&s;e treatment, he would alleviate or aggravate according to the rank of the
<PB N="187" REF="186">
offender. He could not feel that a &s;ecret was of equal importance to a poor, as to a rich per&s;on&mdash;and while Hannah gave no intimation but that her delicacy ro&s;e from fears for her&s;elf, &s;he did not &s;o for|cibly impre&s;s the dean with an opinion that it was a ca&s;e which had pre&s;&s;ing cau&s;e for a private conference, as when &s;he boldly &s;aid, "a part of <HI>his</HI> family, very near to him, was concerned in her tale."</P>
<P>The final re&s;ult of their conver&s;ation in an adjoining room was&mdash;a charge from the dean, in the words of Mr. Rymer, "to hu&s;h the affair up;" and his promi&s;e that the infant &s;hould be immediately taken from her, and "&s;he &s;hould have no more trouble with it."</P>
<P>"I have no trouble with it." Repli|ed Hannah. "It is now all my com|fort; and I cannot part from it."</P>
<P>"Why, you incon&s;i&s;tent woman, did you not attempt to murder it?"</P>
<P>"That was before I had &s;uckled it."</P>
<P>"It is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould give it up&mdash;it mu&s;t be &s;ent &s;ome miles off&mdash;and then the whole circum&s;tance will be &s;oon forgotten."</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187">"<HI>I</HI> &s;hall never forget it."</P>
<P>"No matter&mdash;you mu&s;t give up the child&mdash;Do not mo&s;t of our fir&s;t women of quality part with their children?"</P>
<P>"Women of quality have other things to love&mdash;I have nothing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"And would you occa&s;ion my &s;on, and his new-made bride, the &s;hame and the unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here Hannah bur&s;t into a &s;tood of tears; and being angrily a&s;ked by the dean "why &s;he blubbered &s;o?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I&mdash;have had &s;hame and unea&s;ine&s;s." She replied, wringing her hands.</P>
<P>"And you de&s;erve them&mdash;they are the &s;ure attendants of crimes &s;uch as yours.&mdash;If you allured, and entrapped a young man like my &s;on&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I am the younge&s;t by five years." Said Hannah.</P>
<P>"Well, well, repent;" returned the dean, "repent, and re&s;ign your child. Repent and you may yet marry an ho|ne&s;t man who knows nothing of the mat|ter."</P>
<P>"And repent too?" A&s;ked Hannah.</P>
<P>Not the in&s;ufferable ignorance of young Henry, when he fir&s;t came to England,
<PB N="189" REF="188">
was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than the ru&s;tic folly of poor Han|nah's uncultured replies. He at la&s;t, in an offended and determined manner, told her,</P>
<P>"That if &s;he would re&s;ign the child, and keep the father's name a &s;ecret, not only the child &s;hould be taken care of, but &s;he her&s;elf might, perhaps, receive &s;ome favours; but if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her imprudent folly, &s;he mu&s;t expect no con|&s;ideration on her own account; nor &s;hould &s;he be allowed, for the mainte|nance of the boy, a &s;ixpence beyond the &s;tated &s;um for the poor man's unlawful offspring. Hannah, re&s;olving not to be &s;eparated from her infant, bowed re&s;igna|tion to this la&s;t decree; and, terrified at the loud words and angry looks of the dean, after being regularly di&s;charged, &s;tole to her home; where the &s;miles of her infant, and the care&s;&s;es &s;he lavi&s;hed on it, repaid her for the &s;orrows &s;he had ju&s;t &s;uffered for its &s;ake.</P>
<P>Let it here be ob&s;erved, that the dean, on &s;uffering Hannah to depart without putting, in force the law again&s;t her as he
<PB N="190" REF="189">
had threatened, did nothing, as it were, <HI>behind the curtain.</HI> He openly and can|didly owned to Mr. Rymer, his clerk, and the two con&s;tables who were attend|ing&mdash;"That an affair of &s;ome little gal|lantry, in which, he was extremely &s;orry to &s;ay, his &s;on was rather too nearly in|volved, required, in con&s;ideration of his recent marriage, and an excellent young woman's (his bride's) happine&s;s, that it &s;hould not be publicly talked of&mdash;There|fore he had thought proper only to re|primand the hu&s;&s;ey, and &s;ent her about her bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>The curate a&s;&s;ured the dean&mdash;"That upon this, and upon all other occa&s;ions, which &s;hould, would, or <HI>could</HI> occur, he owed to his judgment, as his &s;uperior, implicit obedience."</P>
<P>The clerk and the two con&s;tables mo&s;t properly &s;aid&mdash;"His honour was a gen|tleman, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t know better how to act than they."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not the plea&s;ure of a mother that Hannah experienced, which could make her in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;orrow of a daughter.</P>
<P>Her parents had received the &s;tranger child along with a fabricated tale &s;he told "of its appertaining to another," without the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion; but, by the &s;ecret diligence of the curate, and the nimble tongues of his elder daugh|ters, the report of all that had pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject of this unfortunate infant, &s;oon circulated through the village; and Han|nah in a few weeks had &s;een her parents pine away in grief and &s;hame at her lo&s;s of virtue.</P>
<P>She perceived the neighbours avoid, or openly &s;neer at <HI>her</HI>&mdash;but that was lit|tle&mdash;&s;he &s;aw them &s;light her aged father and mother upon her account: and &s;he now took the re&s;olution, rather to peri&s;h for want in another part of the country,
<PB N="192" REF="191">
than live where &s;he was known, and &s;o entail a cur&s;e on all who loved her. She &s;lightly hoped, too, that by di&s;ap|pearing from the town and neighbour|hood, &s;ome little reward might be allow|ed her for her bani&s;hment by the dean's family. In that &s;he was deceived&mdash;No &s;ooner was &s;he gone, indeed, than her guilt was forgotten; but with her guilt her wants. The dean and his family re|joiced at her and her child's departure; but as this mode &s;he had cho&s;en; chanc|ed to be no &s;pecified condition in the terms, offered to her, they did not think they were bound to pay her for it; and while &s;he was too fearful and ba&s;hful to &s;olicit the dean, too proud (forlorn as &s;he was) to &s;upplicate his &s;on, they both con|cluded &s;he "wanted for nothing;" for to be poor, and too delicate to complain, they deemed incompatible.</P>
<P>To heighten the &s;en&s;e of her degraded, friendle&s;s &s;ituation, &s;he knew that Henry had not been unmindful of his promi&s;e to her, but that he had applied to his cou&s;in in her and his child's behalf; for he had acquainted her that William's
<PB N="193" REF="192">
an&s;wer was&mdash;"all obligations on <HI>his</HI> part were now undertaken by his father; for Hannah having cho&s;en (in a fit of malig|nity upon his marriage) to appri&s;e the dean of their former intercour&s;e, &s;uch conduct had for ever cancelled all atten|tion due from him to her, or to her child, beyond what its bare maintenance ex|acted."</P>
<P>In vain had Henry explained to him the predicament in which poor Hannah was involved before &s;he con&s;ented to re|veal her &s;ecret to his father; William was happy in an excu&s;e to rid him&s;elf of a burthen, and he &s;eemed to believe, what he wi&s;hed were true&mdash;that &s;he had forfeited all claim to his farther notice.</P>
<P>Henry informed Hannah in as gentle terms as po&s;&s;ible of this unkind reception of his efforts in her favour, for &s;he excit|ed his deepe&s;t compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Perhaps our <HI>own</HI> misfortunes are the cau&s;e of our pity for others, even more than <HI>their</HI> ills; and Henry's pre&s;ent &s;orrows had &s;oftened his heart to peculiar &s;ympathy in woe. He had unhappily found, that the ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of Rebecca, was likely to de|prive
<PB N="194" REF="193">
him of the ble&s;&s;ing of her ever be|coming his wife. For the dean, cha|grined that his &s;on was at length proved an offender in&s;tead of his nephew, &s;ub|mitted to the temptation of puni&s;hing the latter, while he forgave the former. He &s;ent for Henry, and having coldly con|gratulated him on his and Rebecca's in|nocence, repre&s;ented to him the impro|priety of marrying the daughter of a poor curate, and laid his commands on him, "never to harbour &s;uch an intention more." Henry found this re&s;triction &s;o &s;evere that he would not promi&s;e obedi|ence; but on his next attempt to vi&s;it Rebecca, he met a po&s;itive repul&s;e from her father, who &s;ignified to him, "that the dean had forbid him to permit their farther acquaintance;" and the curate declared&mdash;"that, for his own part, he had no will, judgment, or faculties; but that he &s;ubmitted in all things to the &s;u|perior clergy."</P>
<P>At the very time young Henry had re|ceived the propo&s;al from Mr. Rymer of his immediate union with his daughter, and the dean had made no objection,
<PB N="195" REF="194">
Henry waved the happine&s;s for the time pre&s;ent, and had given a rea&s;on why he wi&s;hed it po&s;tponed. The rea&s;on he then gave had its weight, but he had another concealed, of yet more import.&mdash;Much as he loved, and looked forward with rapture to that time when every morning, every evening, and all the day, he &s;hould have the delight of Rebecca's &s;ociety; &s;till there was one other wi&s;h nearer his heart than this&mdash;one de&s;ire which for years had been foremo&s;t in his thoughts, and which not even love could cradicate. He longed, he pined to know what fate had befallen his father. Pro|vided he were living, he could conceive no joy &s;o extreme as that of &s;eeing him! If he were dead, he was anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he owed, by &s;a|tisfying his affectionate curio&s;ity in every circum&s;tance of the &s;ad event.</P>
<P>While a boy, he had frequently ex|pre&s;&s;ed the&s;e &s;entiments to both his uncle and his cou&s;in: &s;ometimes they appri&s;ed him of the total improbability of accom|pli&s;hing his wi&s;hes: at other times, when they &s;aw the di&s;appointment weigh heavy
<PB N="196" REF="195">
on his mind, they bade him&mdash;"wait till he was a man, before he could hope to put his de&s;igns in execution." He did wait. But on the very day he arrived at the age of twenty-one, he made a vow&mdash;"that to gain intelligence of his father &s;hould be the fir&s;t act of his free will."</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to this time he had made all the enquiries po&s;&s;ible, whether any new adventure to that part of Africa in which he was bred, was likely to be un|dertaken. Of this there appeared to be no pro&s;pect, till the intended expedition to Sierra Leone was announced, which favoured his hope of being able to pro|cure a pa&s;&s;age, among tho&s;e adventures, &s;o near to the i&s;land on which his father was (or had been pri&s;oner) as to obtain an opportunity of vi&s;iting it by &s;tealth.</P>
<P>Fearing contention, or the being di&s;|&s;uaded from his plans if he communicat|ed them, he formed them in private, kept them &s;ecretly; and his imagination fill|ed with the kindne&s;s, the tenderne&s;s, the exce&s;s of fondne&s;s he had experienced from his father, beyond any other per&s;on in the world, he had thought with delight
<PB N="197" REF="196">
on the &s;eparation from all his other kin|dred, to pay his duty to him, or to his revered memory. Of late indeed, there had been an object introduced to his ac|quaintance, from whom it was bitter to part; but his de&s;igns had been planned and firmly fixed before he knew Re|becca; nor could he have ta&s;ted content|ment even with her, at the expence of his piety to his father.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t interview he had with the dean, Henry&mdash;perceiving that his di&s;po|&s;ition towards him was not le&s;s &s;evere than when a few days before he had or|dered him on board a ve&s;&s;el&mdash;found this the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the &s;leet to Sierra Leone. His uncle expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e! but imme|diately gave him a &s;um of money, &s;uch as he thought might defray his expences; and as he gave it, by his willingne&s;s, his look, and his accent, &s;eemed to &s;ay, "I fore&s;ee this is the la&s;t you will ever re|quire."</P>
<P>Young William, though a very dutiful &s;on, was amazed when he heard of
<PB N="198" REF="197">
Henry's project, "as the &s;erious and &s;et|tled re&s;olution of a man."</P>
<P>Lady Clementina, Lord and Lady Bendham, and twenty others "wi&s;hed him a &s;ucce&s;sful voyage," and thought no more about him,</P>
<P>It was for Rebecca alone, to feel the lo&s;s of Henry&mdash;it was for a mind like hers alone, to know his worth&mdash;nor did this la&s;t proof of it, the quitting her, for one who claimed by every tie a prefer|ence, le&s;&s;en him in her e&s;teem.&mdash;When, by a me&s;&s;age from him, &s;he became ac|quainted with his de&s;ign, &s;he valued him the more for this ob&s;ervance of his duty, much as it interfered with her happine&s;s&mdash;the more &s;he regretted his lo&s;s, and the more anxiou&s;ly prayed for his return; which, in the following letter, written ju&s;t before his departure, he taught her to hope for.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE Henry could receive a re|ply to his letter, the fleet in which he &s;ailed put to &s;ea on the voyage.</P>
<P>By his ab&s;ence, not only Rebecca was deprived of the friend &s;he loved, but poor Hannah lo&s;t a kind and compa&s;&s;ionate ad|vi&s;er. Her parents, too, both &s;ickened, and both died, in a &s;hort time after&mdash;and now, wholly friendle&s;s, and in her little exile where &s;he could only hope for to|leration, not being known, &s;he was con|tending with &s;u&s;picion, rebuffs, di&s;ap|pointments, and various other ills, that might have made the mo&s;t har&s;h of her Anfield per&s;ecutors feel compa&s;&s;ion for her, could they have witne&s;&s;ed the throbs of her heart, and have viewed the &s;tate of her agoni&s;ing mind.</P>
<P>Still, there are few per&s;ons whom pro|vidence afflicts, beyond the limits of <HI>all</HI> con&s;olation&mdash;few ca&s;t &s;o low, as not to
<PB N="203" REF="202">
feel pride on <HI>certain</HI> occa&s;ions&mdash;and Han|nah felt a comfort, and a dignity in the thought&mdash;that &s;he had both a mind and a body capable of &s;u&s;taining every hard|&s;hip her de&s;tiny might inflict, rather than &s;ubmit to the di&s;grace of &s;oliciting Wil|liam's charity a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>This determination was put to a va|riety of trials&mdash;In vain &s;he offered her|&s;elf to the &s;trangers of the village, in which &s;he was accidentally ca&s;t, as a &s;er|vant&mdash;her child, her dejected looks, her broken &s;entences, a wildne&s;s in her eye, a kind of bold de&s;pair that at times &s;pread over her features, her imperfect &s;tory who, and what &s;he was, prejudiced all tho&s;e to whom &s;he applied; and, after thus travelling to &s;everal &s;mall towns and hamlets, the only employer &s;he could obtain was a farmer, and the only em|ployment, to tend and feed his cattle, while his men were in the harve&s;t, tilling the ground, or at &s;ome other labour, which required, at that time, peculiar expedition.</P>
<P>Though Hannah was born of pea&s;ants, yet, having been an only child, and of
<PB N="204" REF="203">
indu&s;trious parents, &s;he had been nur&s;ed with tenderne&s;s and delicacy, ill &s;uited to her pre&s;ent occupation&mdash;but &s;he en|dured it with patience; and the mo&s;t la|borious part would have &s;eemed light to her, could &s;he have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the reflec|tion&mdash;what it was that had reduced her to it.</P>
<P>Soon her tender hands became hard and rough, her fair &s;kin burnt and yel|low; &s;o that when, on a Sunday, &s;he has looked in the gla&s;s, &s;he has &s;tarted back as if it were &s;ome other face &s;he &s;aw in|&s;tead of her own. But this lo&s;s of beauty gave her no regret&mdash;while William did not &s;ee her, it was of little purport to her, whether &s;he were beautiful or hideous. On the features of her child only, &s;he now looked with joy&mdash;there, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw William at every glance&mdash;and in the fond imagination, felt, at times, every happine&s;s &s;hort of &s;eeing <HI>him.</HI></P>

<P>FROM the mean &s;ubject of oxen, &s;heep, and pea&s;ants, we return to per|&s;onages&mdash;<HI>i. e.</HI> per&s;ons of rank and fortune. The bi&s;hop, who was introduced in the beginning of this work, but who occupied very &s;mall &s;pace there, is now menti|oned here merely that the reader may know, he is at pre&s;ent in the &s;ame &s;tate as his writings&mdash;dying: and that his friend, the dean, is talked of as the mo&s;t likely &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his dignified office.</P>
<P>The dean, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, had a &s;trong friend&s;hip for the bi&s;hop, and now, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, wi&s;hed him to recover&mdash;and yet&mdash;when he reflected on the &s;ucce&s;s of his pamphlet a few years back, and of many which he had written &s;ince, on the very &s;ame &s;ubject, he could not but think "That he had more righteous preten&s;ions to fill the vacant &s;eat of his much be|loved and reverend friend (&s;hould fate ordain it to be vacated) than any other

man:" and he knew that it would not take one moment from that friend's re|maining life, &s;hould he exert him&s;elf, and with all due management, to obtain the elevated &s;tation when <HI>he</HI> &s;hould be no more.</P>
<P>In pre&s;uppo&s;ing the death of a friend, the dean&mdash;like many other virtuous men&mdash;"always &s;uppo&s;ed him going to a bet|ter place." With perfect re&s;ignation, therefore, he waited whatever change might happen to the bi&s;hop; ready to re|ceive him with open arms if he reco|vered, or equally ready, in ca&s;e of his di&s;&s;olution, to receive his dignities.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina di&s;played her &s;en&s;ibi|lity and feeling for the &s;ick prelate, by the di&s;gu&s;ting extravagance of hy&s;teric fits; except at tho&s;e times when &s;he talked &s;eriou&s;ly with her hu&s;band upon the inju&s;tice which &s;he thought would be done to him, and to his many pamphlets and &s;ermons, if he did not immediately ri&s;e to the epi&s;copal honour.</P>
<P>"Surely, dean," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;hould you be di&s;appointed upon this occa&s;ion, you will write no more books for the good of your country?"</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="208">"Yes I will," he replied, "but the next book I write for the good of my country &s;hall be very different, nay the very rever&s;e of tho&s;e I have already written."</P>
<P>"How, dean! would you &s;how your|&s;elf changed?"</P>
<P>"No, but I will &s;how that my country is changed."</P>
<P>"What! &s;ince you produced your la&s;t work? only &s;ix weeks ago!"</P>
<P>"Great changes may occur in &s;ix days;" replied the dean, with a threaten|ing accent: "and if I find things <HI>have</HI> taken a new and improper turn, I will be the fir&s;t to expo&s;e it."</P>
<P>"But before you act in this manner, my dear, &s;urely you will wait&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I will wait till the See is di&s;po&s;ed of to another." Said he.</P>

<P>WHILE the bi&s;hop and his &s;on were &s;ailing before pro&s;perous gales on the ocean of life, young Henry was contend|ing with adver&s;e winds, and many other perils on the watery ocean&mdash;yet &s;till, his di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dangers were le&s;s, than tho&s;e which Hannah had to encounter on land. The &s;ea threatens an untimely death; the &s;hore menaces calamities from which death is a refuge.</P>
<P>The afflictions Hannah had already ex|perienced, could ju&s;t admit of aggrava|tion&mdash;the addition occurred.</P>
<P>Had the good farmer, who made her the companion of his flocks and herds, lived till now, till now &s;he might have been &s;ecure from the annoyance of hu|man kind: but, thrown once more upon &s;ociety, &s;he was unfit to &s;u&s;tain the con|flict of decorum again&s;t depravity.&mdash;Her ma&s;ter, her patron, her pre&s;erver, was dead; and hardly as &s;he had earned the
<PB N="211" REF="210">
pittance &s;he received from him, &s;he &s;ound, it &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all her power to obtain the like again. Her doubtful character, her capacious mind, her unmethodical man|ners were &s;till ill &s;uited to the nice pre|ci&s;ion of a country hou&s;ewife; and as the prudent mi&s;tre&s;s of a family &s;neered at her preten&s;ions, &s;he, in her turn, &s;corn|ed at the narrow-minded mi&s;tre&s;s of a family.</P>
<P>In her enquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting reproaches of di&s;|cretion, &s;he was informed "that London was the only private corner where guilt could be &s;ecreted undi&s;turbed&mdash;and the only public place where in open day, it might triumphantly &s;talk, attended by a train of audacious admirers."</P>
<P>There was a charm to the ear of Han|nah, in the name of London, that thrilled through her &s;oul&mdash;William lived in Lon|don&mdash;and &s;he thought, that while &s;he re|tired to &s;ome dark cellar with her of|fences, he probably would ride in &s;tate with his, and &s;he at humble di&s;tance might &s;ometimes catch a glance of him.</P>

Not all the ig|nominy Hannah experienced in the place where &s;he now was without a home&mdash;not the hunger which &s;he at times &s;uffered, and even at times &s;aw her child endure&mdash;not every inducement for going to London, or motive for quitting her pre|&s;ent de&s;olate &s;tation, had the weight to affect her choice &s;o much as&mdash;In London, &s;he &s;hould live nearer William; in the pre&s;ent &s;pot &s;he could never hope to &s;ee him again; but there &s;he might chance to pa&s;s him in the &s;treets; &s;he might pa&s;s his door unob&s;erved every day; might enquire about him of his inferior neigh|bours, who would be un&s;u&s;picious of the cau&s;e of her curio&s;ity.&mdash;For the&s;e gra|tifications &s;he &s;hould breathe another air&mdash;for the&s;e, &s;he could bear all hard|&s;hips which London threatened; and for the&s;e, &s;he took a threeweeks' journey to that perilous town on foot, cheering, as

&s;he walked along, her innocent and wea|ried companion.</P>

<P>But no &s;ooner did Hannah find her&s;elf within the &s;moke of the metropolis, than the old charm was renewed, and &s;carcely had &s;he refre&s;hed her child at the poor inn at which &s;he &s;topped, than &s;he en|quired&mdash;how far it was to that part of the town where &s;he knew William re|&s;ided.</P>

It was not long before &s;he had occa&s;ion for even more &s;ub&s;tantial comfort. She &s;oon found &s;he was not likely to obtain a &s;ervice here, more than in the country. Some objected that &s;he could not make caps and gowns; &s;ome, that &s;he could not pre&s;erve and pickle; &s;ome, that &s;he was too young; &s;ome, that &s;he was too pretty; and all declined ac|cepting her, till at la&s;t a citizen's wife, on condition of her receiving but half the wages u&s;ually given, took her as a &s;ervant of all work.</P>

of a di&s;&s;atisfied mi&s;tre&s;s; who, not e&s;timating as &s;he ought, the mi&s;ery in|curred by &s;erving her, con&s;tantly threat|ened her &s;ervants "with a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion;" at which the unthinking wretches would tremble merely from the &s;ound of the words&mdash;for, to have reflected&mdash;to have con&s;idered what their purport was&mdash;"to be relea&s;ed from a dungeon, re|lieved from continual upbraidings, and vile drudgery," mu&s;t have been a &s;ubject of rejoicing&mdash;and yet, becau&s;e the&s;e good tidings were delivered as a menace, cu&s;|tom had made the poor creatures fearful of the con&s;equence.

<P>All the care of Hannah to plea&s;e, her fear of offending, her toil&s;ome days, her patience, her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, could not pre|vail on her mi&s;tre&s;s to retain her one hour after by chance &s;he had heard, "that Hannah was the mother of a child; that

<P>HANNAH was driven from &s;ervice to &s;ervice&mdash;her deficiency in the know|ledge of a mere drudge, or her lo&s;t cha|racter, pur&s;ued her wherever &s;he went; and at length, becoming wholly de&s;ti|tute, &s;he gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not the lea&s;t objection.</P>

A child, from whom to part for a day was a torment.&mdash;Yet, before &s;he &s;ubmit|ted her&s;elf to a &s;ituation that filled her mind with a kind of loathing horror, of|ten &s;he paced up and down the &s;treet in which William lived, looked wi&s;tfully at his hou&s;e, and &s;ometimes lo&s;t to all her finer feelings of independent pride, thought of &s;ending a &s;hort petition to him&mdash;but, at the idea of a repul&s;e, and of that frowning brow, which &s;he knew William <HI>could</HI> dart on her, &s;he preferred death, or the mo&s;t degrading life, to the trial.</P>
<P>It was long &s;ince, that misfortune and di&s;honour had made her callous to the good or ill opinion of all the world, ex|cept <HI>his</HI>; and the fear of drawing upon her his encrea&s;ed contempt was &s;till, at the cri&s;is of applying, &s;o powerful, that &s;he found &s;he dared not even hazard a

reproof from him in the per&s;on of his fa|ther; who&s;e rigour &s;he had now more than once experienced, in the frequent har&s;h me&s;&s;ages conveyed to her with the poor &s;tipend for her boy.</P>
<P>Awed by the rigid and pious cha|racter of the new bi&s;hop, the ri&s;ing ho|nours and growing reputation of his &s;on, &s;he mi&s;took the appearance of moral ex|perience, for moral excellence it&s;elf; and felt her own unworthine&s;s even to be|come the &s;upplicant of tho&s;e great men.</P>
<P>Day after day &s;he watched tho&s;e parts of the town through which William's chariot was accu&s;tomed to drive&mdash;but, to &s;ee the carriage was all to which &s;he a&s;|pired&mdash;a feeling, not to be de&s;cribed, forced her to ca&s;t her eyes upon the earth as it drew near to her&mdash;and when it had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he beat her brea&s;t and wept, that &s;he had not &s;een <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;uperiority of others, and her own abject and di&s;gu&s;tful &s;tate, &s;he cried&mdash;"Let me herd with tho&s;e who won't de&s;pi&s;e me&mdash;let me only &s;ee faces whereon I can look without confu&s;ion and terror&mdash;let me a&s;&s;ociate with wretches

<P>With a mind thus langui&s;hing for &s;ym|pathy in di&s;grace, &s;he entered a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e ju&s;t now de&s;cribed. There, accompli&s;hing the fatal proverb again&s;t "<HI>evil communications,</HI>" &s;he had not the fortitude to be an exception to the gene|ral rule&mdash;That pliant di&s;po&s;ition which had yielded to the licentious love of Wil|liam, &s;topped to &s;till ba&s;er pro&s;titution in company &s;till more depraved.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;he &s;huddered at tho&s;e prac|tices that &s;he &s;aw, at tho&s;e conver&s;ations that &s;he heard; and ble&s;t her&s;elf that po|verty, not inclination, had cau&s;ed her to be a witne&s;s of &s;uch things, and had con|demned her in the vile abode to be a &s;ervant, rather, than in the lower rank of mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;U&s;e &s;oftened tho&s;e horrors every day&mdash;at length &s;elf-defence, the fear of ridicule, and the hope of favour, induced her to adopt that very conduct from which her heart revolted.</P>
<P>In her &s;orrowful countenance, and fad|ing charms, there yet remained attracti|on
<PB N="221" REF="220">
for many vi&s;itors&mdash;and &s;he now &s;ub|mitted to the mercenary profanations of love; more odious, as her mind had been &s;ubdued by its mo&s;t &s;acred and en|dearing joys.</P>
<P>While ince&s;&s;ant regret whi&s;pered to her "&s;he ought to have endured every calamity rather than this," &s;he thus que&s;|tioned her nice &s;en&s;e of wrong&mdash;"Why, why re&s;pect my&s;elf, while no other re|&s;pects me? Why &s;et a value on my own feelings, when no one el&s;e does?"</P>
<P>Degraded in her own judgment, &s;he doubted her own under&s;tanding when it &s;ometimes told her &s;he had de&s;erved bet|ter treatment&mdash;for &s;he felt her&s;elf a fool in compari&s;on with her learned &s;educer, and the re&s;t who de&s;pi&s;ed her. "And why," &s;he continued, "&s;hould I ungrate|fully per&s;i&s;t to contemn women, who alone are &s;o kind as to accept me a com|panion? Why refu&s;e conformity to their cu&s;toms, while none of my &s;ex be&s;ides, will admit me to their &s;ociety a partaker of theirs?"</P>
<P>In &s;peculation the&s;e arguments appear|ed rea&s;onable, and &s;he pur&s;ued their dic|tates
<PB N="222" REF="221">
&mdash;but in the practice of the life in which &s;he plunged, &s;he proved the fallacy of the &s;y&s;tem; and at times tore her hair with frantic &s;orrow&mdash;that &s;he did not continue in the mid-way of guilt, and &s;o pre&s;erve &s;ome little portion of &s;elf-appro|bation, to recompence her, in a &s;mall de|gree, for the total lo&s;s of the e&s;teem of all the virtuous world.</P>

<P>IS there a reader &s;o little experienced in the human heart, &s;o forgetful of his own as not to feel the po&s;&s;ibility of the following fact?</P>
<P>A &s;eries of uncommon calamities had been for many years the lot of the elder Henry&mdash;a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pro&s;perous events had fallen to the &s;hare of his brother Wil|liam&mdash;The one was the envy, while the other had the compa&s;&s;ion of all who thought about them. For the la&s;t twenty years William had lived in affluence bordering upon &s;plendour, his friends, his fame, his fortune daily encrea&s;ing; while Henry, throughout that very period, had, by degrees, lo&s;t all he loved on earth, and was now exi&s;ting apart from civili&s;|ed &s;ociety&mdash;and yet&mdash;during tho&s;e twenty years, where William knew one happy moment, Henry ta&s;ted hundreds.</P>
<P>That the &s;tate of the mind, and not outward circum&s;tances, is the nice point on which happine&s;s depends, is but a
<PB N="224" REF="223">
quaint remark: but that intellectual power &s;hould have the force to render a man di&s;contented in extraordinary pro&s;|perity &s;uch as that of the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop, or contented in his brother's extreme of adver&s;ity, requires illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great affliction to Henry was his brother's ingratitude; but rea&s;oning on the frailty of man's nature, and the power of man's temptations, he found excu&s;es for William, which made him &s;upport the treatment he had received, with more tranquillity, than William's proud mind &s;upported his brother's mar|riage&mdash;Henry's indulgent di&s;po&s;ition made him le&s;s angry with William, than William was with him.</P>
<P>The next affliction Henry &s;uffered, was the lo&s;s of his beloved wife&mdash;that was a grief which time and change of objects gradually alleviated; while William's wife was a permanent grief to him; her puerile mind, her talking vanity, her af|fected virtues, &s;oured his dome&s;tic com|fort; and, in time, he had &s;uffered more painful moments from her &s;ociety, than his brother had experienced, even from the death of her he loved,</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="224">In their children, indeed, William was the happie&s;t&mdash;his &s;on was a pride and plea&s;ure to him, while Henry never thought upon <HI>his</HI> without lamenting his lo&s;s with bitter angui&s;h. But if the elder brother had in this in&s;tance the advan|tage, &s;till Henry had a re&s;ource to over|balance this article. Henry, as he lay impri&s;oned in his dungeon, and when, after his puni&s;hment was remitted, he was again allowed to wander and &s;eek his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence where he would; in all his tedious walks and &s;olitary re&s;ting-places, during all his lonely days and mournful nights, had <HI>this re&s;ource</HI> to con&s;ole him:</P>
<P>"I never did an injury to any one: never was har&s;h, &s;evere, unkind, deceit|ful: I did not merely confine my&s;elf to do my neighbour no harm; I &s;trove to &s;erve him."</P>
<P>This was the re&s;ource that cheered his &s;inking heart amid&s;t gloomy de&s;erts and a barbarous people; lulled him to peace|ful &s;lumber in the hut of a &s;avage hunter, and in the &s;ound of the lion's roar; at times impre&s;&s;ed him with a &s;en&s;e of hap|pine&s;s; and made him contemplate with
<PB N="226" REF="225">
a longing hope, the retribution of a fu|ture world.</P>

<P>But though, comparatively with his brother, William was the le&s;s happy man, yet his &s;elf-reproach was not of &s;uch magnitude, for an offence of that atroci|ous nature, as to bani&s;h a certain degree of happine&s;s, and a &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;miles of fortune from his brea&s;t&mdash;nor was Henry's &s;elf-acquittal of &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite kind, as to cha&s;e away the feeling of his de&s;olate &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="226">As he fi&s;hed or hunted for his daily dinner, many a time in full view of his prey, a &s;udden bur&s;t of &s;orrow at his fate, a &s;udden longing for &s;ome dear &s;ociety, for &s;ome friend to &s;hare his thoughts, for &s;ome kind &s;houlder on which to lean his head, for &s;ome companion to partake of his repa&s;t, would make him in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly de&s;i&s;t from his pur&s;uit, ca&s;t him on the ground in a fit of angui&s;h, till a &s;hower of tears, and his <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> came to his relief.</P>
<P>It was on a &s;ultry morning, when, af|ter plea&s;ant dreams during the night, he had walked with more than u&s;ual per|ception of his mi&s;ery; that, &s;itting upon the bench, his wi&s;hes and his looks all bent on the &s;ea towards his native land, he thought he &s;aw a &s;ail &s;welling before an unexpected breeze.</P>
<P>"Sure I am dreaming &s;till!" he cried. "This is the very ve&s;&s;el I &s;aw la&s;t night in my &s;leep!&mdash;Oh! what cruel mockery, that my eyes &s;hould &s;o deceive me!"</P>
<P>Yet though he doubted, he leaped upon his feet in tran&s;port!&mdash;held up his hands, &s;tretched at their length, in a

kind of ec&s;tatic joy!&mdash;and as the glorious fight approached, was near ru&s;hing into the &s;ea to meet it.</P>
<P>For a while hope and fear kept him in a &s;tate bordering on di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Now he &s;aw the &s;hip making for the &s;hore, and tears flowed for the grateful pro&s;pect. Now it made for another point, and he vented &s;hrieks and groans from the di&s;appointment.</P>

<P>After a few minutes pa&s;&s;ed in dread|ful uncertainty, which enhanced the wi&s;hed-for happine&s;s, the &s;hip evidently drew near the land&mdash;a boat was launch|ed from her&mdash;and while Henry, now up|on his knees, wept, and prayed fervently for the event; a youth &s;prang from the barge on the &s;trand, ru&s;hed towards him, and falling on his neck, then at his feet, exclaimed&mdash;"My father! oh my fa|ther!"</P>

<P>THE cro&s;&s;es at land and the perilous events at &s;ea, had made it now &s;everal years &s;ince young Henry fir&s;t took the vow of a man, no longer dependent on the will of another, to &s;eek his father. His fatigues, his dangers were well re|compen&s;ed! In&s;tead of weeping over a &s;ilent grave, he had the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy to receive a parent's ble&s;&s;ing for his la|bours. Yet, the elder Henry, though living, was &s;o changed in per&s;on, that his &s;on would &s;carcely have known him in any other than the favourite &s;pot, which the younger (keeping in memory every incident of his former life) knew his father had always cho&s;en for his morning contemplations; and where, previou&s;ly to his coming to England, he had many a time kept him company. It was to that particular corner of the i&s;land that the captain of the &s;hip had generou&s;ly or|dered they &s;hould &s;teer, out of the ge|neral
<PB N="231" REF="230">
route, to gratify the filial tender|ne&s;s he expre&s;&s;ed. But &s;carcely had the interview between the father and the &s;on taken place, than a band of natives, whom the appearance of the ve&s;&s;el had called from the woods and hills, came to attack the invaders. The elder Henry had no friend with whom he wi&s;hed to &s;hake hands at his departure; the old negro &s;ervant who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in young Henry's e&s;cape was dead; and he ex|perienced the exce&s;&s;ive joy of bidding adieu to a place, without one regret for all he left behind.</P>
<P>On the night of that day, who&s;e morn|ing had been marked by peculiar &s;adne&s;s, at the louring pro&s;pect of many exiled years to come; he &s;lept on board an En|gli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, with Engli&s;hmen his compa|nions, and his &s;on, his beloved &s;on&mdash;who was &s;till more dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his re&s;cue&mdash;his attentive &s;ervant, and mo&s;t affectionate friend.</P>
<P>Though many a year pa&s;&s;ed, and many a rough encounter was de&s;tined to the lot of the two Henrys before they &s;aw the
<PB N="232" REF="231">
&s;hores of Europe, yet to them, to live or to die together was happine&s;s enough&mdash;even young Henry for a time a&s;ked for no greater ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;but, the fir&s;t glow of filial ardor over, he called to mind, "Rebecca lived in England;" and every exertion which love, founded on the highe&s;t reverence and e&s;teem, could dic|tate, he employed to expedite a voyage, the end of which would be crowned by the &s;ight of her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE contra&s;t of the &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s between the two brothers, was nearly re&s;embled by that of the two cou&s;ins&mdash;the riches of young William did not render him happy, nor did the poverty of young Henry doom him to mi&s;ery. His affectionate heart, as he had de|&s;cribed in his letter to Rebecca, loved <HI>per&s;ons</HI> rather than <HI>things,</HI> and he would not have exchanged the &s;ociety of his father, or the pro&s;pect of her hand and heart, for all the wealth and finery of which his cou&s;in William was the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He was right. Young William, though he viewed with contempt Henry's in|ferior &s;tate, was far le&s;s happy than he&mdash;His marriage had been the very counter|part of his father's; and having no child to create affection to his home, his &s;tudy, was the only relief from the dome&s;tic in|cumbrance, his wife: and though by unremitting application there (joined to
<PB N="234" REF="233">
the influence of the potent relations of the woman he hated) he at length arrived at the &s;ummit of his ambitious de&s;ires, &s;till they poorly repaid him, for the &s;a|crifice he had made in early life, of every tender di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Striding through a li&s;t of rapid ad|vancements, in the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, at the age of thirty-eight he found him|&s;elf rai&s;ed to preferment, &s;uch as rarely falls to the &s;hare of a man of his &s;hort experience&mdash;he found him&s;elf inve&s;ted with a judge's robe; and gratified by the exalted office, curbed more than ever that aver&s;ion, which her want of charms or &s;ympathy, had produced again&s;t the partner of his honours.</P>
<P>While William had thus been daily ri&s;ing in fortune's favour, poor Hannah had been daily &s;inking deeper and deeper under fortune's frowns: till at la&s;t &s;he became a midnight wanderer through the &s;treets of London, &s;oliciting, or rudely demanding money of the pa&s;&s;ing &s;tranger. Sometimes, hunted by the watch, &s;he affrighted fled from &s;treet to &s;treet, from portico to portico&mdash;and once, un|knowing
<PB N="235" REF="234">
in her fear which way &s;he hur|ried, &s;he found her trembling knees had &s;unk, and her wearied head was reclined, again&s;t the pillars that guarded William's door.</P>
<P>At the &s;udden recollection where &s;he was, a &s;well of pa&s;&s;ion, compo&s;ed of hor|ror, of de&s;pair, and love, gave re-ani|mated &s;trength to her failing limbs; and, regardle&s;s of her pur&s;uers' &s;teps, &s;he ran to the centre of the &s;treet, and looking up to the windows of the hou&s;e, cried, "Ah! there he &s;leeps in quiet, in peace, in ea&s;e&mdash;he does not even dream of me&mdash;he does not care how the cold pierces, or how the people per&s;ecute me!&mdash;He does not thank me for all the lavi&s;h love I have borne him and his child!&mdash;His heart is &s;o hard, he does not even recol|lect that it was he, who brought me to ruin."</P>
<P>Had the&s;e mi&s;eries, common to the un|happy pro&s;titute, been alone the puni&s;h|ment of Hannah&mdash;had her crimes and &s;ufferings ended in di&s;tre&s;s like this, her &s;tory had not perhaps been &s;elected for a public recital; for it had been no other
<PB N="236" REF="235">
than the cu&s;tomary hi&s;tory of thou&s;ands of her &s;ex. But Hannah had a de&s;tiny yet more &s;evere.&mdash;Unhappily, &s;he was endowed with a mind &s;o &s;en&s;ibly alive to every joy, and every &s;orrow, to every mark of kindne&s;s, every token of &s;eve|rity; &s;o liable to exce&s;s in pa&s;&s;ion, that once perverted, there was no degree of error from which it would with firmne&s;s revolt.</P>
<P>Taught by the conver&s;ation of the di&s;|&s;olute poor, with whom &s;he now a&s;&s;o|ciated, or by her own ob&s;ervation on the worldly reward of elevated villany, &s;he began to &s;u&s;pect "that di&s;hone&s;ty was only held a &s;in, to &s;ecure the property of the rich; and that, to take from tho&s;e who did not want, by the art of &s;tealing, was le&s;s guilt, than to take from tho&s;e who did want, by the power of the law."</P>
<P>By fal&s;e, yet &s;educing opinions &s;uch as the&s;e, her rea&s;on e&s;tranged from every moral and religious tie, her nece&s;&s;ities urgent, the reluctantly aceepted the pro|po&s;al, to mix with a band of practi&s;ed &s;harpers and robbers; and become an accomplice in negotiating bills forged on a country banker.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="236">But though ingenious in arguments to excu&s;e the deed before its commi&s;&s;ion; in the act, &s;he had the dread of &s;ome un|controvertible &s;tatement on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Intimidated by this con|viction, &s;he was the verie&s;t bungler in her vile profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;and on the alarm of being detected, while every one of her confe|derates e&s;caped and ab&s;conded, &s;he alone was &s;eized&mdash;was arre&s;ted for i&s;&s;uing notes they had fabricated, and committed to the provincial jail, about fifty miles from London, where the crime was per|petrated, to take her trial for&mdash;life or death.</P>

<P>THE day at length is come, on which Hannah &s;hall have a &s;ight of her beloved William!&mdash;She, who has watched for hours near his door, to procure a glimp&s;e of him going out, or returning home; who has walked miles to &s;ee his chariot pa&s;s; &s;he now will behold him, and he will &s;ee her, by the command of the laws of their country&mdash;Tho&s;e laws that will deal with rigour towards her, in this one in&s;tance are &s;till indulgent.</P>
<P>The time of the a&s;&s;izes, at the county-town in which &s;he is impri&s;oned, is ar|rived&mdash;the pri&s;oners are demanded at the &s;hire-hall&mdash;the jail doors are opened&mdash;they go in &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The trumpet &s;ounds&mdash;it &s;peaks the arrival of the judge&mdash;and that judge is William.</P>
<P>The day previous to her trial, Hannah had read, in the printed calendar of the pri&s;oners, his name as the learned ju&s;tice before whom &s;he was to appear. For a
<PB N="239" REF="238">
moment &s;he forgot her perilous &s;tate in the exce&s;s of joy, which the &s;till uncon|querable love &s;he bore to him, permitted her to ta&s;te even on the brink of the grave!&mdash;After-reflection made her check tho&s;e worldly tran&s;ports, as unfit for the pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion. But alas! to her, earth and William were &s;o clo&s;ely united, that, till &s;he for&s;ook the one, &s;he could never cea&s;e to think, without the contending pa&s;&s;ions of hope, of fear, of joy, of love, of &s;hame, and of de&s;pair, on the other.</P>
<P>Now fear took place of her fir&s;t immo|derate joy&mdash;&s;he feared, that although much changed in per&s;on &s;ince he had &s;een her, and her real name now added to many an <HI>alias</HI>&mdash;yet &s;he feared that &s;ome well-known glance of the eye, turn of the action, or accent of &s;peech, might recall her to his remembrance; and at that idea &s;hame overcame all her other &s;en&s;ations&mdash;for &s;till &s;he retained pride, in re&s;pect to <HI>his</HI> opinion, to wi&s;h him not to know, Hannah was that wretch &s;he felt &s;he was!&mdash;Once a ray of hope beamed on her, "that if he knew her, if he re|cogni&s;ed
<PB N="240" REF="239">
her, he might po&s;&s;ibly befriend her cau&s;e"&mdash;and life be&s;towed through William's friend&s;hip &s;eemed a precious object&mdash;But again, that rigorous honour &s;he had often heard him boa&s;t, that firm|ne&s;s to his word, of which &s;he had fatal experience, taught her to know, he would not for any improper compa&s;&s;ion, any unmanly weakne&s;s, forfeit his oath of impartial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In meditations &s;uch as the&s;e &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;leeple&s;s night.</P>
<P>When, in the morning, &s;he was brought to the bar, and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgment-&s;eat of William; imagination could not form two figures, or two &s;ituations more in|compatible with the exi&s;tence of former familiarity, than the judge and the cul|prit&mdash;and yet, the&s;e very per&s;ons had pa&s;&s;ed together the mo&s;t bli&s;sful moments that either ever ta&s;ted!&mdash;Tho&s;e hours of tender dalliance were now pre&s;ent to <HI>her</HI> mind&mdash;<HI>His</HI> thoughts were more nobly employed in his high office&mdash;nor could the haggard face, hollow eye, de&s;pond|ing countenance, and meagre per&s;on of
<PB N="241" REF="240">
the poor pri&s;oner, once call to his me|mory, though her name was uttered among a li&s;t of others that &s;he had a&s;&s;umed, his former youthful, lovely, Hannah!</P>
<P>She heard her&s;elf arraigned with trem|bling limbs and downca&s;t looks&mdash;and many witne&s;&s;es had appeared again&s;t her, before &s;he ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge. She then gave one fear|ful glance, and di&s;covered William, un|pitying, but beloved William, in every feature! It was a face &s;he had been u&s;ed to look on with delight, and a kind of ab&s;ent &s;mile of gladne&s;s, now beamed on her poor wan vi&s;age.</P>
<P>When every witne&s;s on the part of the pro&s;ecutor had been examined, the judge addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her,</P>
<P>"What defence have you to make?"</P>
<P>It was William &s;poke to Hannah!&mdash;The &s;ound was &s;weet&mdash;the voice was mild, was &s;oft, compa&s;&s;ionate, encourag|ing!&mdash;It almo&s;t charmed her to a love of life!&mdash;not &s;uch a voice as when Wil|liam la&s;t add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ed her; when he left her undone and pregnant, vowing "never to &s;ee or &s;peak to her more."</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="241">She could have hung upon the pre&s;ent words for ever! She did not call to mind that this gentlene&s;s was the effect of prac|tice, the art of his occupation: which at times, is but a copy, by the unfeeling, from his benevolent brothers of the bench. In the pre&s;ent judge, tenderne&s;s was not de&s;igned for the culprit's con&s;olation, but for the approbation of the auditors.</P>
<P>There were no &s;pectators, Hannah, by your &s;ide when la&s;t he parted from you&mdash;if there had, the awful William had been awed to marks of pity.</P>
<P>Stunned with the enchantment of that well-known tongue directed to her, &s;he &s;tood like one ju&s;t petrified&mdash;all vital power was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Again he put the que&s;tion, and with the&s;e additional &s;entences, tenderly and emphatically delivered&mdash;"Recollect your&s;elf&mdash;Have you no witne&s;&s;es? No proof in your behalf?"</P>
<P>A dead &s;ilence followed the&s;e que&s;|tions.</P>
<P>He then mildly, but forcibly, added&mdash;"What have you to &s;ay?"</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="242">Here, a flood of tears bur&s;t from her eyes, which &s;he fixed earne&s;tly upon him, as if pleading for mercy, while &s;he faintly articulated,</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord."</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e, he a&s;ked her, in the &s;ame forcible but benevolent tone</P>
<P>"Have you no one to &s;peak for your character?"</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>A &s;econd gu&s;h of tears followed this reply, for &s;he called to mind by <HI>whom,</HI> her character had fir&s;t been bla&s;ted.</P>
<P>He &s;ummed up the evidence&mdash;and every time he was compelled to pre&s;s hard upon the proofs again&s;t her, &s;he &s;hrunk, and &s;eemed to &s;tagger with the deadly blow&mdash;writhed under the weight of <HI>his</HI> minute ju&s;tice, more than from the pro&s;|pect of a &s;hameful death.</P>
<P>The jury con&s;ulted but a few minutes&mdash;the verdict was&mdash;</P>
<P>"Guilty."</P>
<P>She heard it with compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head, and ro&s;e to pronounce
<PB N="244" REF="243">
her &s;entence&mdash;&s;he &s;tarted with a kind of convul&s;ive motion&mdash;retreated a &s;tep or two back, and lifting up her hands, with a &s;cream exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh! not from <HI>you!</HI>"</P>
<P>The piercing &s;hriek which accompanied the&s;e words, prevented their being heard by part of the audience; and tho&s;e who heard them, thought little of their mean|ing, more, than that they expre&s;&s;ed her fear of dying.</P>
<P>Serene, and dignified, as if no &s;uch exclamation had been uttered, William delivered the fatal &s;peech, ending with&mdash;"Dead, dead, dead."</P>
<P>She fainted as he clo&s;ed the period, and was carried back to pri&s;on in a &s;woon; while he adjourned the court to go to dinner.</P>

<P>IF, unaffected by the &s;cene he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed, William &s;at down to dinner with an appetite, let not the reader conceive, that the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea had &s;truck his mind&mdash;of his ever having &s;een, much le&s;s familiarly known, the poor offender whom he had ju&s;t condemned. Still this forgetfulne&s;s did not proceed from the want of memory for Hannah&mdash;In every peevi&s;h or heavy hour pa&s;&s;ed with his wife, he was &s;ure to think of her&mdash;yet, it was &s;elf-love, rather than love of <HI>her,</HI> that gave ri&s;e to the&s;e thoughts&mdash;he felt the want of female &s;ympathy and tender|ne&s;s, to &s;often the fatigue of &s;tudious la|bour; to &s;oothe a &s;ullen, a moro&s;e di&s;po|&s;ition&mdash;he felt he wanted comfort for him&s;elf, but never once con&s;idered, what Hannah's wants were.</P>
<P>In the chagrin of a barren bed, he &s;ometimes thought, too, even on the child that Hannah bore him; but whether it
<PB N="246" REF="245">
were male or female, whether a beggar in the &s;treets, or dead&mdash;various and im|portant public occupations, forbade him to wa&s;te time to enquire. Yet the poor, the widow, and the orphan, frequently &s;hared William's o&s;tentatious bounty. He was the pre&s;ident of many excellent charities; gave largely; and &s;ometimes in&s;tituted benevolent &s;ocieties for the un|happy: for he delighted to load the poor with obligations, and the rich with prai&s;e.</P>
<P>There are per&s;ons like him, who love to do every good, but that which their immediate duty requires&mdash;There are &s;er|vants who will &s;erve every one more cheerfully than their ma&s;ters&mdash;There are men who will di&s;tribute money liberally to all, except their creditors&mdash;And there are wives who will love any man better than their hu&s;bands.&mdash;<HI>Duty</HI> is a familiar word which has little effect upon an or|dinary mind: and as ordinary minds are in a va&s;t majority, we have acts of ge|nero&s;ity, valour, &s;elf-denial, and bounty, where &s;maller pains would con&s;titute greater virtues.&mdash;Had William followed the <HI>common</HI> dictates of charity; had he

adopted private pity, in&s;tead of public munificence: had he ca&s;t an eye at home, before he &s;ought abroad for objects of compa&s;&s;ion, Hannah had been pre&s;erved from an ignominious death, and he had been pre&s;erved from&mdash;<HI>Remor&s;e.</HI>&mdash;The tor|tures of which, he for the fir&s;t time proved, on reading a printed &s;heet of paper thrown accidentally in his way, a few days after he had left the town in which he had con|demned her to die.</P>

<P>So great was this unhappy woman's terror of death, and the awful judg|ment that was to follow, that when &s;entence was pronounced upon her, &s;he fell into a &s;woon, from that into convul&s;ions, from which &s;he never en|tirely recovered, but was delirious to the time of her execution, except that &s;hort interval in which &s;he made her confe&s;&s;ion to the clergyman who at|tended her&mdash;She has left one child, a youth about &s;ixteen, who has never for&s;aken his mother during all the time of her impri&s;onment, but with true filial duty waited on her&mdash;and no &s;ooner was her fatal &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed, than he began to droop, and now lies dangerou&s;ly ill near the pri&s;on from which &s;he is relea&s;ed by death&mdash;Dur|ing the lo&s;s of her &s;en&s;es, the &s;aid Han|nah

raved continually on this child&mdash;and, a&s;king for pen, ink, and paper, wrote an incoheret petition to the judge, recommending the youth to his pro|tection and mercy. But notwith&s;tand|ing this in&s;anity, &s;he behaved with compo&s;ure and re&s;ignation, when the fatal period arrived that &s;he was to be launched, into eternity. She prayed devoutly during the la&s;t hour, and &s;eemed to have her whole mind fixed on the world to which &s;he was going&mdash;A crowd of &s;pectators followed her to the fatal &s;pot, mo&s;t of whom returned weeping at the recollection of the fer|vency with which &s;he prayed, and the impre&s;&s;ion which her dreadful &s;tate &s;eemed to make upon her.</P>

<P>No &s;ooner had the name of "Anfield" &s;truck William, than a thou&s;and reflec|tions and remembrances fla&s;hed on his mind to give him conviction, whom he had judged and &s;entenced. He recol|lected the &s;ad remains of Hannah, &s;uch as he once had known her&mdash;and now he
<PB N="251" REF="250">
wondered how his thoughts could have been ab&s;ent from an object &s;o pitiable, &s;o worthy of his attention, as not to give him even a &s;u&s;picion who &s;he was, either from her name, or from her per&s;on, dur|ing the whole trial!</P>
<P>But wonder, a&s;toni&s;hment, horror, and every other &s;en&s;ation, was ab&s;orbed in&mdash;<HI>Remor&s;e:</HI>&mdash;It wounded, it &s;tabbed, it rent his hard heart, as it would do a tender one&mdash;It havocked on his firm inflexible mind, as it would on a weak and pliant brain!&mdash;Spirit of Hannah!

<P>A FEW momentary ce&s;&s;ations from the pangs of a guilty con&s;cience were given to William, as &s;oon as he had di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger to the jail in which Hannah had been confined, to enquire after the &s;on &s;he had left behind, and to give orders that immediate care &s;hould be taken of his health and &s;afety&mdash;He likewi&s;e charged the me&s;&s;enger to convey back to him the petition &s;he had addre&s;&s;|ed to him during her &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;anity; for it was now no trivial con&s;olation to him, that he might po&s;&s;ibly have it in his power to grant a reque&s;t from her.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger returned with the writ|ten paper, which had been con&s;idered by the per&s;ons to whom &s;he had entru&s;t|ed it, as the di&s;tracted &s;entences of an in|&s;ane mind; but to William, they proved beyond a doubt, that &s;he was perfectly in her &s;en&s;es.</P>

<P>William rejoiced, as he laid down the petition, that &s;he had a&s;ked a favour he could be&s;tow; and hoped, by his pro|tection of the &s;on, to redre&s;s, in a degree, the wrongs he had done the mother.

<P>"How!" Cried William.</P>

<P>Robbed, by this news, of his only gleam of con&s;olation&mdash;in the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having done a mortal injury for which he never now by any means could atone, he &s;aw all his honours, all his riches, all his proud &s;elfi&s;h triumphs dance before him!

<P>THE progre&s;&s;ive ri&s;e of William, and fall of Hannah, had now occupied nearly the term of eighteen years&mdash;added to the&s;e, another year elap&s;ed before the younger Henry completed the errand on which his heart was fixed. Shipwreck, impri&s;onment, and ills to which the poor and unfriended traveller is peculiarly ex|po&s;ed, detained the father and &s;on in va|rious remote regions until the pre&s;ent pe|riod; and for the la&s;t fifteen years, de|nied them the means of all corre&s;pon|dence with their own country.</P>
<P>The elder Henry was now pa&s;t &s;ixty years of age, and the younger almo&s;t be|yond the prime of life. Still length of time had not dimini&s;hed, but rather had encrea&s;ed, their anxious longings for their native home.</P>
<P>The &s;orrows, di&s;appointments, and fa|tigues that throughout the&s;e tedious years were endured by the two Henrys, are of that dull monotonous kind of &s;uffering,
<PB N="257" REF="256">
better omitted than de&s;cribed: mere re|petitions of the exile's woe, that &s;hall give place to the tran&s;porting joy, of re|turn from bani&s;hment!&mdash;Yet, much as the younger had reckoned with impati|ent wi&s;hes, the hours that were pa&s;&s;ed di&s;tant from her he loved, no &s;ooner was his di&s;a&s;trous voyage at an end, and his feet trod upon the &s;hores of England, and a thou&s;and wounding fears made him almo&s;t doubt, whether it were happine&s;s or mi&s;ery he had obtained by his arrival. If Rebecca were living, he knew it mu&s;t be happine&s;s&mdash;for his heart dwelt with confidence on her faith&mdash;her unchang|ing &s;entiments. "But death might po&s;|&s;ibly have ravi&s;hed from his hopes what no mortal power could have done." And thus the lover creates a rival in every ill, rather than &s;uffer his fears to remain inanimate.</P>
<P>The elder Henry had le&s;s to fear or to hope than his &s;on&mdash;yet he both feared and hoped with a &s;en&s;ibility that gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety. He hoped his brother would receive him with kind|ne&s;s, after his long ab&s;ence, and once
<PB N="258" REF="257">
more take his &s;on cordially to his fa|vour. He longed impatiently to behold his brother; to &s;ee his nephew; nay, in the ardour of the renewed affection he ju&s;t now felt, he thought even a di&s;tant view of Lady Clementina would be grate|ful to his &s;ight! But &s;till, well remem|bering the pomp, the &s;tate, the pride of William, he could not rely on <HI>his</HI> affec|tion, &s;o much he knew that it depended on external circum&s;tances to excite, or to extingui&s;h his love. Not that he fear|ed an ab&s;olute repul&s;ion from his bro|ther; but he feared, what, to a delicate mind, is &s;till wor&s;e&mdash;Re&s;erved manners, cold looks, ab&s;ent &s;entences, and all the cruel retinue of indifference, with which tho&s;e who are beloved, &s;o often wound the bo&s;om that adores them.</P>
<P>By enquiring of their countrymen (whom they met as they approached to the end of their voyage) concerning their relation the dean, the two Henrys learn|ed that he was well, and had for &s;ome years pa&s;t been exalted to the bi&s;hop|rick of * * *. This news gave them joy, while it encrea&s;ed their fear of not re|ceiving a familiar welcome.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="258">The younger Henry, on his landing, wrote immediately to his uncle, ac|quainting him with his father's arrival in the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of poverty: he ad|dre&s;&s;ed his letters to the bi&s;hop's country re&s;idence, where he knew, as it was the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, he would certainly be: He and his father then &s;et off on foot, to|wards that re&s;idence&mdash;a palace!</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop's palace was not &s;ituated above fifty miles from the port where they had landed: and at a &s;mall inn about three miles from the bi&s;hop's, they propo&s;ed (as the letter to him intimated) to wait for his an&s;wer, before they intrud|ed into his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>At the town where they came on &s;hore, and as they walked on their journey, though it was &s;omewhat &s;olitary, that they knew no creature whom they met or &s;aw; yet it was no &s;mall con&s;olation, that no creature knew them.</P>
<P>"To be poor and ragged, father," the younger &s;milingly &s;aid, "is no di&s;grace, no &s;hame, thank heaven, where the ob|ject is not known."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="259">"True, my &s;on," replied Henry, "and perhaps I feel my&s;elf much happier now unknowing and unknown to all but you, than I &s;hall in the pre&s;ence of my fortu|nate brother and his family: for there, confu&s;ion at my ill &s;ucce&s;s through life, may give me greater pain, than even my misfortunes have inflicted."</P>
<P>After uttering this reflection that had preyed upon his mind, he &s;at down on the road &s;ide to re&s;t his di&s;comfited limbs, before he could proceed farther. His &s;on rea&s;oned with him; gave him cou|rage; and now his hopes preponderat|ed; till after two days' journey, on ar|riving at the inn where an an&s;wer from the bi&s;hop was expected, no letter, no me&s;&s;age had been left.</P>
<P>"He means to renounce us." Said Henry trembling and whi&s;pering to his &s;on.</P>
<P>Without di&s;clo&s;ing to the people of the hou&s;e who they were, or from whom the letter or the me&s;&s;age they enquired for was to have cone, they retired, and con|&s;ulted what &s;teps they were now to pur|&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">Previou&s;ly to his writing to the bi&s;hop, the younger Henry's heart, all his incli|nations had &s;wayed him towards a vi&s;it to the village in which was his uncle's former country &s;eat&mdash;the beloved vil|lage of Anfield&mdash;but, re&s;pect and duty to him had made him check tho&s;e wi&s;hes&mdash;now, they revived again&mdash;and with the image of Rebecca before his eyes, he warmly entreated his father to go with him to Anfield, at pre&s;ent only thirty miles di&s;tance, and from thence, write once more&mdash;then wait the will of his uncle.</P>
<P>The father con&s;ented to this propo&s;al, even glad to po&s;tpone the vi&s;it to his dig|nified brother.</P>
<P>After a &s;canty repa&s;t, &s;uch as they had been long inured to, they quitted the inn, and took the road towards Anfield.</P>

<P>IT was about five in the afternoon of a &s;ummer's day, that Henry and his &s;on left the &s;ign of the Mermaid, and began their third day's journey: the young man's &s;pirits elated with the pro&s;pect of the reception he &s;hould meet from Re|becca; the elder dejected, at not receiv|ing a welcome from his brother.</P>
<P>The road which led to Anfield nece&s;|&s;arily took our travellers within &s;ight of the bi&s;hop's palace&mdash;the turrets appeared at a di&s;tance&mdash;and on the &s;udden turn round the corner of a large plantation, the whole magnificent &s;tructure was at once exhibited, before his brother's a&s;to|ni&s;hed eyes! He was &s;truck with the gran|deur of the habitation&mdash;and, totally for|getting, all the unkind, the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its owner (like the &s;ame Henry in his earlier years) &s;miled with a kind of tran&s;port "that William was &s;o great a man."</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="262">After this fir&s;t joyous &s;en&s;ation was over, "Let us go a little nearer, my &s;on," &s;aid he, "no one will &s;ee us I hope: or if they &s;hould, you can run and conceal your&s;elf; and not a creature will know <HI>me</HI>&mdash;even my brother would not know me thus altered&mdash;and I wi&s;h to take a little farther view of his fine hou&s;e, and all his plea&s;ure grounds."</P>
<P>Young Henry, though impatient to be gone, would not object to his father's de|&s;ire.&mdash;They walked forward between a &s;hady grove and a purling rivulet, &s;nuffed in odours from the je&s;&s;amine banks, and li&s;tened to the melody of an adjoining aviary.</P>
<P>The allurements of the &s;pot &s;eemed to enchain the elder Henry, and he at length &s;auntered to the very avenue of the dwell|ing: but ju&s;t as he had &s;et his daring, yet trembling feet, upon the turf that led to the palace gates: he &s;uddenly &s;topped, on hearing, as he thought, the village clock &s;trike &s;even; which reminded him, that evening drew on, and it was time to go.&mdash;He li&s;tened again&mdash;when he and his
<PB N="264" REF="263">
&s;on, both together &s;aid "It is the toll of the bell before &s;ome funeral."</P>
<P>The &s;ignals of death, while they hum|ble the rich, in&s;pire the poor with pride. The pa&s;&s;ing-bell gave Henry a momentary &s;en&s;e of equality, and he courageou&s;ly &s;tept forward to the fir&s;t winding of the avenue.</P>
<P>He darted back at the &s;ight which pre|&s;ented it&s;elf!</P>
<P>A hear&s;e&mdash;mourning coaches&mdash;mutes&mdash;plumed hor&s;es&mdash;with every other token of the per&s;on's importance, who was go|ing to be committed to the earth.</P>
<P>Scarce had his terrified eyes been thus unexpectedly &s;truck&mdash;when a coffin borne by &s;ix men i&s;&s;ued from the gates, and was depo&s;ited in the waiting receptacle; while gentlemen in mourning went into the different coaches.</P>
<P>A &s;tandard-bearer now appeared with an e&s;cutcheon, on which the keys and mitre were di&s;played. Young Henry, upon this, pathetically exclaimed</P>
<P>"My uncle!&mdash;It is my uncle's funeral!"</P>
<P>Henry, his father, bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion moved along.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="264">The two Henrys, the only real mour|ners in the train, followed at a little di&s;|tance&mdash;in rags, but in tears.</P>
<P>The elder Henry's heart was nearly bur&s;ting&mdash;he longed to cla&s;p the dead corp&s;e of his brother, without the dread of being &s;purned for his pre&s;umption.&mdash;He now could no longer remember him either as the dean, or bi&s;hop; but leap|ing over that whole interval of pride and arrogance, called only to his memory William, &s;uch as he knew him when they lived at home together, together walked to London, and there together, almo&s;t peri&s;hed for want.</P>
<P>They arrived at the church&mdash;and while the coffin was placing in the dreary vault, Henry crept &s;lowly after to the hideous &s;pot&mdash;His reflections now took a different point. "Is this po&s;&s;ible?" he &s;aid to him|&s;elf. "Is this the dean whom I ever feared? Is this the bi&s;hop of whom, within the pre&s;ent hour, I &s;tood in awe? Is this William, who&s;e every glance &s;truck me with his &s;uperiority? Alas! my brother, and is this horrid abode the return for all your a&s;piring efforts? Is this the only
<PB N="266" REF="265">
remains of your greatne&s;s, which you exhibit to me on my return? Did you fore&s;ee an end like this, while you treated me, and many more of your youthful companions, with haughtine&s;s and con|tempt? While you thought it becoming of your dignity to &s;hun and de&s;pi&s;e us? Where is the difference now between my departed wife and you? or, if there be a difference, &s;he, perchance has the ad|vantage.&mdash;Ah! my poor brother, for di&s;|tinction in the other world, I tru&s;t, &s;ome of your anxious labours have been em|ployed; for you are now of le&s;s import|ance in this, than when you and I fir&s;t left our native town, and hoped for no|thing greater, than to be &s;uffered to exi&s;t."</P>
<P>On their quitting the church, they en|quired of the by-&s;tanders, particulars of the bi&s;hop's death, and heard he had been &s;uddenly carried off by a raging fever.</P>
<P>Young Henry enquired "If Lady Cle|mentina was at the palace, or Mr. Nor|wynne?"</P>
<P>"The latter is there"&mdash;he was an|&s;wered by a poor woman, "but Lady
<PB N="267" REF="266">
Clementina has been dead the&s;e four years."</P>
<P>"Dead! Dead!" cried young Henry, "That worldly woman, quitted this world for ever!"</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered the &s;tranger, "&s;he caught cold by wearing a new-fa&s;hioned dre&s;s that did not half cover her, wa&s;ted all away, and died the mi&s;erable&s;t object you ever heard of."</P>
<P>The per&s;on who gave this melancholy intelligence concluded it with a hearty laugh; which would have &s;urpri&s;ed the two hearers, if they had not before ob|&s;erved&mdash;that among&s;t all the village crowd that attended to &s;ee this &s;olemn &s;how, not one afflicted countenance appeared, not one dejected look, not one watery eye. The pa&s;tor was &s;carcely known to his flock&mdash;it was in London his meridian lay&mdash;at the levee of mini&s;ters&mdash;at the table of peers&mdash;at the drawing-rooms of the great&mdash;and now his neglected pari&s;hi|oners, paid his indifference in kind.</P>
<P>The ceremony over, and the mourn|ing-&s;uite departed, the &s;pectators di&s;per&s;ed with &s;miling faces from the &s;ad &s;pot;
<PB N="268" REF="267">
while the Henrys, with heavy hearts, retraced their &s;teps back towards the pa|lace.&mdash;In their way, at the cro&s;&s;ing of a &s;tile, they met a poor labourer returning from his day's work; who looking ear|ne&s;tly at the throng of per&s;ons who were leaving the church-yard, &s;aid to the elder Henry</P>
<P>"Pray, ma&s;ter, what are all them folk gathered together about? What's the matter there?"</P>
<P>"There has been a funeral." Replied Henry.</P>
<P>"Oh zooks, what! a burying!&mdash;ay, now I &s;ee it is&mdash;and I warrant, of our old bi&s;hop&mdash;I heard he was main ill&mdash;It is he, they have been putting into the ground, is not it?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Said Henry.</P>
<P>"Why then &s;o much the better."</P>
<P>"The better!" cried Henry.</P>
<P>"Yes ma&s;ter&mdash;though, I &s;hould be loath to be, where he is now."</P>
<P>Henry &s;tarted&mdash;"He was your pa&s;tor, man."</P>
<P>"Ha ha ha&mdash;I &s;hould be &s;orry that my ma&s;ter's &s;heep that are feeding yonder,
<PB N="269" REF="268">
&s;hould have no better pa&s;tor&mdash;the fox would &s;oon get them all."</P>
<P>"You &s;urely did not know him!"</P>
<P>"Not much, I can't &s;ay I did&mdash;for he was above &s;peaking to poor folks&mdash;unle&s;s they did any mi&s;chief, and then he was &s;ure to take notice of them."</P>
<P>"I believe he meant well." Said Henry.</P>
<P>"As to what he meant, God only knows&mdash;but I know what he <HI>did.</HI>"</P>
<P>"And what did he?"</P>
<P>"Nothing at all for the poor."</P>
<P>"If any of them applied to him, no doubt&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh! they knew better than all that comes to&mdash;for if they a&s;ked for any thing, he was &s;ure to have them &s;ent to bride-well, or the work-hou&s;e.&mdash;He u&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;"<HI>The workhou&s;e was a fine place for a poor man&mdash;the food good enough, and enough of it</HI>&mdash;" yet he kept a dainty table him&s;elf. His dogs, too, fared better than we poor. He was va&s;tly tender and good to all his hor&s;es and dogs, I <HI>will</HI> &s;ay that for him: and to all brute bea&s;ts: he would &s;uffer them to be either &s;tarved or
<PB N="270" REF="269">
&s;truck&mdash;but he had no compa&s;&s;ion for his fellow creatures."</P>
<P>"I am &s;en&s;ible you do him wrong."</P>
<P>"That <HI>he</HI> is the be&s;t judge of by this time. He has &s;ent many a poor man to the hou&s;e of correction&mdash;and now 'tis well, if he has not got a place there him|&s;elf. Ha ha ha!"</P>
<P>"Did he give nothing in charity?"</P>
<P>"Next to nothing. A little weak broth, that runs through one's &s;tomach like mad&mdash;a working man, ma&s;ter, can't live on &s;uch me&s;s&mdash;and my wife wore out more &s;hoe-leather going after it; and lo&s;t more time waiting at the door before his fat &s;ervants would bring it her, than the thing was worth.&mdash;However, as we &s;hould not &s;peak ill of the dead, I &s;ay nothing again&s;t him. So good night, ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>The man was walking away when Henry called to him&mdash;"Pray can you tell me if the bi&s;hop's &s;on, is at the pa|lace?"</P>
<P>"Oh yes, you'll find ma&s;ter there, treading in the the old man's &s;hoes, as proud as Lucifer!"</P>
<P>"Has he any children?"</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="270">No, plea&s;e God! There's been enough of the name&mdash;and after the &s;on is gone, I hope we &s;hall have no more of the breed."</P>
<P>"Is Mrs. Norwynne, the &s;on's wife, at the palace?"</P>
<P>"What, ma&s;ter, did not you know what's become of her?"</P>
<P>"Any accident?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ha ha ha&mdash;yes. I can't help laugh|ing&mdash;why, ma&s;ter, &s;he made a mi&s;take, and went to another man's bed&mdash;and &s;o her hu&s;band and &s;he were parted&mdash;and &s;he has married the other man."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" cried Henry amazed.</P>
<P>"Ay, indeed&mdash;but if it had been my wife or yours, the bi&s;hop would have made her do penance in a white &s;heet&mdash;but as it was a lady, why, it was all very well&mdash;and any one of us, that had been known to talk about it, would have been &s;ent to bridewell &s;traight&mdash;But we <HI>did</HI> talk, notwith&s;tanding."</P>
<P>The malicious joy with which the pea|&s;ant told this &s;tory, made Henry believe (more than all the complaints the man uttered) that there had been want of cha|rity
<PB N="272" REF="271">
and chri&s;tian deportment, in the conduct of the bi&s;hop's family. He al|mo&s;t wi&s;hed him&s;elf back on his &s;avage i&s;land, where brotherly love could not be le&s;s, than it appeared to be in this civi|li&s;ed country.</P>

<P>AS Henry and his &s;on, after parting from the poor labourer, approached the late bi&s;hop's palace, all the charms of its magnificence, its &s;ituation, which but a few hours before, had captivated the elder Henry's mind, was vani&s;hed&mdash;and, from the mournful ceremony he had &s;ince been witne&s;s of, he now viewed this noble edi|fice, but as a heap of rubbi&s;h piled toge|ther to fa&s;cinate weak under&s;tandings; and to make even the wi&s;e and religious man, at times, forget why he was &s;ent into this world.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of pre&s;enting them&s;elves to their nephew and cou&s;in, they both felt an unconquerable reluctance to enter un|der the &s;uperb, the melancholy roof&mdash;a bank, a hedge, a tree, a hill, &s;eemed at this juncture, a plea&s;anter &s;helter: and each felt him&s;elf happy in being a harm|le&s;s wanderer on the face of the earth, rather than living in &s;plendor, while the
<PB N="274" REF="273">
wants, the revilings of the hungry and the naked, were crying to heaven for vengeance.</P>
<P>They gave a heart-felt &s;igh to the va|nity of the rich and the powerful; and pur&s;ued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>They arrived at Anfield.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by apprehen&s;ions, which his uncle's funeral had &s;erved to encrea&s;e, young Henry, as he entered the well|known village, feared every &s;ound he heard would convey intelligence of Re|becca's death. He &s;aw the par&s;onage hou&s;e at a di&s;tance, but dreaded to ap|proach it, le&s;t Rebecca &s;hould no longer be an inhabitant.&mdash;His father indulged him in the wi&s;h to take a &s;hort &s;urvey of the village, and rather learn by indirect means, by ob&s;ervation, his fate, than hear it all at once from the lips of &s;ome blunt relater.</P>
<P>Anfield had undergone great changes &s;ince Henry left it.&mdash;He found &s;ome cot|tages rai&s;ed where formerly there were none; and &s;ome were no more, where he had frequently called, and held &s;hort
<PB N="275" REF="274">
conver&s;ations, with the poor who dwelt in them. Among&s;t the latter number was the hou&s;e of Hannah's parents&mdash;fallen to the ground! He wondered to him&s;elf where that poor family had taken up their abode? Henry, in a kinder world!</P>
<P>He once again ca&s;t a look at the par|&s;onage hou&s;e&mdash;his inqui&s;itive eye inform|ed him, there, no alteration had taken place externally&mdash;but he feared what change might be within.</P>
<P>At length he obtained the courage to enter the church-yard in his way to it.&mdash;As he &s;lowly and tremblingly moved along, he &s;topped to read here and there a grave-&s;tone, as mild, in&s;tructive, con|veyers of intelligence, to which he could attend with more re&s;ignation, than to any o her reporter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;tone he came to, he found was erected <HI>To the memory of the Reverend Thomas Rymer.</HI> Rebecca's father. He in&s;tantly called to mind all that poor en|rate's quick &s;en&s;ibility of wrong, towards <HI>him&s;elf</HI>; his unbridled rage in con&s;e|quence; and &s;miled to think&mdash;how tri|vial
<PB N="276" REF="275">
now appeared all, for which he gave way to &s;uch exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, &s;hocked at the death of one &s;o near to her he loved, he now feared to read on; and accidentally ca&s;t his eyes from the tombs to the church. Through the window of the chancel, his &s;ight was &s;truck with a tall monument of large di|men&s;ions rai&s;ed &s;ince his departure, and adorned with the fine&s;t &s;culpture. His curio&s;ity was excited&mdash;he drew near, and he could di&s;tingui&s;h (followed by elegant poetic prai&s;e) "<HI>To the memory of John Lord Vi&s;count Bendham.</HI>"</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemn, melan|choly, anxious bent of Henry's mind, he could not read the&s;e words, and behold his co&s;tly fabric, without indulging a momentary fit of indignant laughter.</P>
<P>"Are &s;culpture and poetry thus deba&s;|ed," he cried, "to perpetuate the memo|ry of a man, who&s;e be&s;t advantage is to be forgotten? Who&s;e no one action me|rits record, but as an example to be &s;hun|ned."</P>
<P>An elderly woman leaning on her &s;tick, now pa&s;&s;ed along the lane by the
<PB N="277" REF="276">
&s;ide of the church.&mdash;The younger Henry acco&s;ted her, and ventured to enquire "Where the daughters of Mr. Rymer, &s;ince his death, were gone to live?"</P>
<P>"We live," &s;he returned, "in that &s;mall cottage acro&s;s the clover field."</P>
<P>Henry looked again, and thought he had mi&s;taken the word <HI>we</HI>&mdash;for he felt a&s;&s;ured, that he had no knowledge of the per&s;on to whom he &s;poke.</P>
<P>But &s;he knew him, and, after a pau&s;e, cried&mdash;"Ah! Mr. Henry, you are wel|come back. I am heartily glad to &s;ee you&mdash;and my poor &s;i&s;ter Rebecca will go out of her wits with joy."</P>
<P>"Is Rebecca living, and will be glad to &s;ee me?" he cagerly a&s;ked, while tears of rapture trickled down his face. "Fa|ther," he continued in his ec&s;tacy, "we are now come home to be completely happy&mdash;and I feel as if all the years I have been away, were but a &s;hort week; and as if all the dangers I have pa&s;&s;ed, had been light as a feather.&mdash;But is it po&s;&s;ible," he cried, to his kind informer, "that you are one of Rebecca's &s;i&s;ters?"</P>
<P>Well might he a&s;k; for in&s;tead of the blooming woman of &s;even-and-twenty he
<PB N="278" REF="277">
had left her, her colour was gone, her teeth impaired, her voice broken. She was near fifty.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am one of Mr. Rymer's daugh|ters." She replied.</P>
<P>"But which?" Said Henry.</P>
<P>"The elde&s;t, and once called the pret|tie&s;t." She returned. "Though now people tell me I am altered&mdash;yet I can|not &s;ay I &s;ee it my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"And are you all living?" Henry en|quired.</P>
<P>"All but one: &s;he married and died. The other three, on my father's death, agreed to live together and knit or &s;pin for our &s;upport. So we took that &s;mall cottage and furni&s;hed it with &s;ome of the par&s;onage furniture, as you &s;hall &s;ee&mdash;and kindly welcome I am &s;ure you will be to all it affords, though that is but little."</P>
<P>As &s;he was &s;aying this, &s;he led him through the clover field towards the cot|tage.&mdash;His heart rebounded with joy that Rebecca was there&mdash;yet, as he walk|ed, he &s;huddered at the impre&s;&s;ion which he feared, the fir&s;t &s;ight of her would
<PB N="279" REF="278">
make. He feared, what he imagined (till he had &s;een this change in his &s;i&s;ter) he &s;hould never heed. He feared Re|becca would look no longer young. He was not yet &s;ufficient ma&s;ter over all his &s;en&s;ual propen&s;ities, as, when the trial came, to think he could behold her look like her &s;i&s;ter, and not give &s;ome evi|dence of his di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>His fears were vain.&mdash;On entering the gate of their little garden, Rebecca ru&s;h|ed from the hou&s;e to meet them, ju&s;t the &s;ame Rebecca as ever.</P>
<P>It was her mind, which beaming on her face, and actuating her every moti|on, had ever con&s;tituted all her charms: it was her mind which had gained her Henry's affection; that mind had under|gone no change, and &s;he was the &s;elf-&s;ame woman he had left her.</P>
<P>He was entranced with joy.</P>

<P>THE fare which the Henrys partook at the cottage of the female Rymers, was &s;uch as the &s;i&s;ter had de&s;cribed, mean, and even &s;canty; but this did not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h the happine&s;s they receiv|ed in meeting, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince their arrival in England, human beings who were glad to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>At a &s;tinted repa&s;t of milk and vege|tables, a glimmering light by a little bru&s;h-wood on the hearth, they yet could feel them&s;elves comparatively ble&s;t, while they li&s;tened to the recital of afflictions, which had befallen per&s;ons around that very neighbourhood, for whom every de|licious viand had been procured to gratify the ta&s;te, every art devi&s;ed to delight all the other &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>It was by the &s;ide of this glimmering fire, that Rebecca and her &s;i&s;ters told the &s;tory of poor Hannah's fate; and of the thorn it had for ever planted in Willi|am's bo&s;om&mdash;of his reported &s;leeple&s;s,
<PB N="281" REF="280">
perturbed nights; and his gloomy, or &s;tarting, and half-di&s;tracted days: when, in the fullne&s;s of remor&s;e, he has com|plained&mdash;"Of a guilty con&s;cience! Of the wearine&s;s attached to continued pro&s;|perity! the mi&s;ery of wanting an object of affection!"</P>
<P>They told of Lord Bendham's death from the effects of intemperance; from a ma&s;s of blood infected by high &s;ea&s;on|ed di&s;hes, mixed with copious draughts of wine&mdash;repletion of food and liquor, not le&s;s fatal to the exi&s;tence of the rich, than the want of common &s;u&s;tenance to the lives of the poor.</P>
<P>They told of Lady Bendham's ruin &s;ince her Lord's death, by gaming&mdash;They told, "that now &s;he &s;uffered beyond the pain of common indigence, by the cut|ting triumph of tho&s;e, whom &s;he had for|merly de&s;pi&s;ed."</P>
<P>They related (what has been told be|fore) the divorce of William; and the marriage of his wife with a libertine&mdash;The decea&s;e of Lady Clementina; occa|&s;ioned by that incorrigible vanity, which even old age could not &s;ubdue.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="281">After numerous other examples had been recited of the dangers, the evils that riches draw upon their owner; the elder Henry ro&s;e from his chair, and em|bracing Rebecca and his &s;on, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"How much indebted are <HI>we</HI> to pro|vidence, my children, who, while it in|flicts poverty, be&s;tows peace of mind; and in return for the trivial grief we meet in this world, holds out to our long|ing hopes, the reward of the next!"</P>
<P>Not only re&s;igned, but happy in their &s;tation; with hearts made cheerful rather than dejected by attentive meditation; Henry and his &s;on planned the means of their future &s;upport, independent of their kin&s;man William&mdash;not only of him, but of every per&s;on and thing, but their own indu&s;try.</P>
<P>"While I have health and &s;trength," (cried the old man, and his &s;on's looks acquie&s;ced in all the father &s;aid) "I will not take from any one in affluence, what only belongs to the widow, the father|le&s;s, and the infirm; for to &s;uch alone, by chri&s;tian laws&mdash;however cu&s;tom may &s;ubvert them&mdash;the overplus of the rich is due."</P>

<P>BY forming an humble &s;cheme for their remaining life, a &s;cheme depending upon their <HI>own</HI> exertions alone; on no light promi&s;es of pretended friends, and on no &s;anguine hopes of certain &s;ucce&s;s; but with prudent apprehen&s;ion, with forti|tude again&s;t di&s;appointment, Henry, his &s;on, and Rebecca, (now his daughter) found them&s;elves, at the end of one year, in the enjoyment of every comfort which &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed minds knew how to ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Exempt both from patronage and from controul&mdash;healthy, alive to every fruition with which nature ble&s;&s;es the world; dead to all out of their power to attain, the works of art&mdash;&s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which endear human creatures one to another, in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e which &s;eparate man from man&mdash;they found them&s;elves the thankful inhabitants of a &s;mall hou&s;e or hut, placed on the borders of the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="283">Each morning wakes the father and the &s;on to cheerful labour in fi&s;hing, or the tending of a garden, the produce of which they carry with their fi&s;h to the next market town. The evening &s;ends them back to their home in joy; where Rebecca meets them at the door, affec|tionately boa&s;ts of the warm meal that is ready, and heightens the charms of conver&s;ation with her ta&s;te and judg|ment.</P>
<P>It was after a &s;upper of roots from their little garden, poultry that Rebec|ca's hand had reared, and a jug brewed by young Henry, that the following di&s;|cour&s;e took place:</P>
<P>"My &s;on," &s;aid the elder Henry, "where under the &s;ky, &s;hall three per|&s;ons be met together, happy as we three are? It is the want of indu&s;try, or the want of reflection, which makes the poor di&s;&s;atisfied. Labour gives a value to re&s;t, which the idle can never ta&s;te; and reflection gives to the mind content, which the unthinking never can know."</P>
<P>"I once," replied the younger Henry, "con&s;idered poverty a cur&s;e&mdash;but after
<PB N="285" REF="284">
my thoughts became enlarged, and I had a&s;&s;ociated for years with the rich, and now mix with the poor, my opinion has undergone a total change&mdash;for I have &s;een, and have enjoyed, more real plea|&s;ure at work with my fellow labourers, and in this cottage, than ever I beheld, or experienced, during my abode at my uncle's; during all my intercour&s;e with the fa&s;hionable, and the powerful of this world."</P>
<P>"The wor&s;t is," &s;aid Rebecca, "the poor have not always enough."</P>
<P>"Who has enough?" a&s;ked her hu&s;|band. "Had my uncle? No&mdash;he hoped for more&mdash;and in all his writings &s;acri|ficed his duty to his avarice. Had his &s;on enough, when he yielded up his ho|nour, his dome&s;tic peace, to gratify his ambition? Had Lady Bendham enough when &s;he &s;taked all &s;he had, in the hope of becoming richer? Were we, my Re|becca, of di&s;contented minds, we have now too little. But con&s;cious, from ob|&s;ervation and experience, that the rich are not &s;o happy as our&s;elves, we rejoice in our lot."</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="285">The tear of joy that &s;tole from her eye, expre&s;&s;ed more than his words&mdash;a &s;tate of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He continued, "I remember, that when I fir&s;t came a boy to England, the poor excited my compa&s;&s;ion; but now that my judgment is matured, I pity the rich. I know that in this opulent king|dom, there are near as many per&s;ons pe|ri&s;hing through intemperance, as &s;tarv|ing with hunger&mdash;there are as many mi|&s;erable in the la&s;&s;itude of having nothing to do, as there are, bowed down to the earth with hard labour&mdash;there are more per&s;ons who draw upon them&s;elves cala|mity by following their own will, than there are, who experience it by obeying the will of another. Add to this, the rich fear dying, &s;o much, they have no comfort in living."</P>
<P>"There the poor have another advan|tage," &s;aid Rebecca: "for they may defy not only death, but every lo&s;s by &s;ea or land, for they have nothing to lo&s;e."</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides," added the elder Henry, "there is a certain joy, of the mo&s;t gra|tifying kind that the human mind is ca|pable
<PB N="287" REF="286">
of ta&s;ting, peculiar to the poor; and of which the rich can but &s;eldom ex|perience the delight."</P>
<P>"What can that be?" cried Rebecca.</P>
<P>"A kind word, a benevolent &s;mile, one token of e&s;teem from the per&s;on, whom we con&s;ider as our &s;uperior."</P>
<P>To which Rebecca replied, "And the rarity of obtaining &s;uch a token, is what encrea&s;es the honour."</P>
<P>"Certainly:" returned young Henry, "and yet tho&s;e in poverty, ungrateful as they are, murmur again&s;t that govern|ment from which they receive the ble&s;|&s;ing; and, unlearned as they are, would attempt to alter it.&mdash;We leave to the phy|&s;ician the care of re&s;toring our health, we employ the &s;oldier in fighting our battles, and the lawyer in the defence of our for|tunes, without pre&s;uming to interrupt them in their vocations&mdash;then, why not leave, and without mole&s;tation, tho&s;e to govern a kingdom who have &s;tudied the &s;cience of politics? For though a phy|&s;ician may not always be &s;kilful, a &s;ol|dier may not always have courage, a lawyer not always hone&s;ty, or a mini&s;ter
<PB N="288" REF="287">
always good fortune&mdash;yet, we &s;hould con|&s;ider, that it is not upon earth we are to look for a &s;tate of perfection&mdash;it is only in heaven&mdash;and there, we may re&s;t a&s;|&s;ured, that no practitioner in the profe&s;|&s;ions I have named, will ever be admitted to di&s;turb our eternal felicity.</P>
