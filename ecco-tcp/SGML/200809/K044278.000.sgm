<P>THE School for Wives.</P>
<P>A COMEDY.</P>
<P>AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following performance cannot commit it to the pre&s;s, without acknow|ledging the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude, for the un|common marks of approbation with which he has been honoured by the Public.</P>
<P>Tho' he has cho&s;en a title us'd by MOLIERE, he has neither borrowed a &s;ingle circum&s;tance from that great poet, nor to the be&s;t of his recollection from any other writer.&mdash;His chief &s;tudy has been to &s;teer between the extremes of &s;entimental gloom, and the exce&s;&s;es of unintere&s;ting levity; he has &s;ome laugh, yet he hopes he has al&s;o &s;ome le&s;&s;on; and fa&s;hionable as it has been lately for the wits,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
even with his friend Mr. Garrick at their head, to ridicule the Comic Mu&s;e, when a little grave, he mu&s;t think that &s;he degenerates into farce, where the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of in&s;truction is neglected, and con&s;ider it as a here&s;y in critici&s;m, to &s;ay that one of the mo&s;t arduous ta&s;ks within the reach of literature, &s;hou'd, when executed; be wholly without utility.</P>
<P>The Author having been pre&s;umptuous enough to a&s;&s;ert, that he has not purloin'd a &s;ingle &s;prig of bays from the brow of any other writer, he may, perhaps, be a&s;k'd, if there are not &s;everal plays in the Engli&s;h language, which, before his, produced Generals, Lawyers, Iri&s;hmen, Duels, Ma&s;que|rades, and Mi&s;takes? He an&s;wers, yes; and con|fe&s;&s;es moreover, that all the Comedies before his, were compos'd not only of men and women, but that before his, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of comedy con|&s;i&s;ted in making difficulties for the purpo&s;e of re|moving them; in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing poor young lovers; and in rendering a happy marriage the object of every cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Yet tho' the Author of the School for Wives, pleads guilty to all the&s;e charges, &s;till, in extenuation of his offence, he begs leave to ob&s;erve, that having
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
only men and women to introduce upon the &s;tage, he was oblig'd to compo&s;e his Dramatis Per&s;onae of mere fle&s;h and blood; if, however, he has thrown this fle&s;h and this blood, into <HI>new</HI> &s;ituations; if he has given a <HI>new</HI> fable, and plac'd his characters in a point of light hitherto unex|hibited:&mdash;he flat.ters him&s;elf that he may call his play, a <HI>new</HI> play, and tho' it did not exi&s;t before the creation of the world, like the famous Welch pedigree, that he may have &s;ome &s;mall preten&s;ions to originality.</P>
<P>Two things be&s;ides the general moral incul|cated thro' his piece, the Author has attempted; the fir&s;t, to re&s;cue the law, as a profe&s;&s;ion, from ridicule or obliquy; and the &s;econd, to remove the imputation of a barbarous ferocity, which dra|matic writers, even meaning to compliment the Iri&s;h nation, have connected with their Idea of that gallant people:&mdash;The law, like every other profe&s;&s;ion, may have members who occa&s;ionally di&s;grace it; but to the glory of the Briti&s;h name, it is well know that in the wor&s;t of times, it has produced numbers who&s;e virtues reflected honour upon human nature; many of the noble&s;t privileges the con&s;titution has to boa&s;t of, were derived from the integrity, or the wi&s;dom of lawyers:
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
Yet the &s;tage has hitherto ca&s;t an indi&s;criminate &s;tigma upon the whole body, and laboured to make that profe&s;&s;ion either odious or contemptible in the theatre, which, if the laws are indeed dear to good Engli&s;hmen, can never be too much re&s;pected in this kingdom. There is &s;carcely a play in which a lawyer is introduced, that is not a libel upon the long robe; and &s;o ignorant have many dramatic writers been, that they have made no di&s;tinction whatever, between the characters of the fir&s;t Barri|&s;ters in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, and the meane&s;t &s;olicitors at the Old Bailey.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the gentlemen of Ireland, where even an ab&s;olue attempt is manife&s;ted, to place them in a favourable point of view, they are drawn with a brutal promptitude to quarrel, which is a di&s;|grace to the well known humanity of their coun|try.&mdash;The gentlemen of Ireland have doubtle&s;s a quick &s;en&s;e of honour, and, like the gentlemen of England, as well as like the gentlemen of every other high-&s;pirited nation, are perhaps unhappily too rea|dy to draw the &s;word, where they conceive them&s;elves injured&mdash;But to make them proud of a barbarous propen&s;ity to Duelling; to make them actually de|light in the effu&s;ion of blood, is to fa&s;ten a very unju&s;t reproach upon their general character, and to ren|der
<PB N="v" REF="6">
them univer&s;ally obnoxious to &s;ociety. The author of the School for Wives therefore, has given a different picture of Iri&s;h manners, though in humble life, and flatters him&s;elf that tho&s;e who are really acquainted with the original, will acknow|lege it to be at lea&s;t a tolerable re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>It would be ungrateful in the highe&s;t degree to clo&s;e this preface, without acknowleging the very great obligations which the author has to Mr. Garrick. Every attention, which either as a ma|nager, or as a man, he could give to the intere&s;t of the following play, he has be&s;towed with the mo&s;t generous alacrity; but univer&s;ally admired as he is at pre&s;ent, his intrin&s;ic value will not be known, till his lo&s;s is deplored; and the public have great rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that this may be a very di&s;tant event in the annals of the theatre. The Epilogue &s;ufficiently marks the ma&s;terly hand from which it originated; &s;o does the comic commencement of the Prologue, and the elegant writer of the graver part, is a character of di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence in the literary republic.</P>
<P>It has been remarked with great ju&s;tice, that few new pieces were ever better performed than <HI>The School for Wives.</HI> Mr. King, that highly-de&s;erving
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
favourite of the town, was every thing the author could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h in General Savage. Mr. Red|di&s;h acquired a very con&s;iderable &s;hare of merited reputation in Belville. Mr. Moody is unequalled in his Iri&s;hmen. Mr. Palmer, from his manner of &s;upporting Lee&s;on, was entitled to a much better part: And Mr. We&s;ton in Torington was admi|rable. Mi&s;s Younge, in Mrs. Belville, extorted applau&s;e from the colde&s;t auditor. Her ten|derne&s;s&mdash;her force&mdash;her pathos, were the true effu&s;ions of genius, and proved that &s;he has no &s;uperior where the feelings are to be intere&s;ted. With re&s;pect to Mrs. Abington, enough can never be &s;aid. The elegance, the vivacity, the critical nicety with which &s;he went through Mi&s;s Wal|&s;ingham, is only to be gue&s;&s;ed at, by tho&s;e who are familiar with the performance of that exqui&s;ite ac|tre&s;s. Her Epilogue was delivered with an anima|tion not to be conceived, and manife&s;ted the &s;trict propriety, with which &s;he is called the fir&s;t prie&s;te&s;s of the Comic Mu&s;e in this country.</P>

<P>No, I took care of that; for tho' &s;he is'n't married to my father, &s;he has ten times the influence of a wife, and might injure me not a little with him, if I didn't &s;upport her &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>

<P>Yes, &s;he became almo&s;t frantic in re|ality, when &s;he found her&s;elf treated like a mad|woman.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="15">

<P>Belville's affected &s;urpri&s;e too, was admi|rable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the hypocritical compo&s;ure of his countenance, and his counterfeit pity for the poor woman, were intolerable!</P>

<P>While that amiable creature, his wife, im|plicitly believed every &s;yllable he &s;aid&mdash;</P>

<P>And felt nothing but pity for the ac|cu&s;er, in&s;tead of paying the lea&s;t regard to the accu|&s;ation. But pray, is it really under a pretence of getting the girl upon the &s;tage, that Belville has taken away Mrs. Tempe&s;t's neice from the people &s;he boarded with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is: Belville, ever on the look out for fre&s;h objects, met her in tho&s;e primitive regions of purity, the Green-Boxes; where, di&s;covering that &s;he was pa&s;&s;ion|ately de&s;irous of becoming an actre&s;s, he improved his acquaintance with her, in the fictitious character of an Iri&s;h manager, and &s;he eloped la&s;t night, to be, as &s;he imagines, the heroine of a Dublin theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, then, as he has kept his real name artfully conceal'd, Mrs. Tempe&s;t can at mo&s;t but &s;u&s;pect him of Mi&s;s Lee&s;on's &s;eduction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of no more; and this, only, from the de&s;cription of the people who &s;aw him in company with her at the play; but, I wi&s;h the affair may not have a &s;erious conclu&s;ion; for &s;he has a brother, a very &s;pirited young fellow, who is a council in the Temple, and who will certainly call Belville to an account, the moment he hears of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what will become of the poor creature after he has de&s;erted her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know that Belville is generous to pro|fu&s;ion, and has a thou&s;and good qualities to counter-balance this &s;ingle fault of gallantry, which con|taminates his character.</P>

<P>Nay, don't think us all alike.</P>

<P>Nay, no more of this, my love; no peo|ple live happier than Belville and his wife; nor is there a man in England, notwith&s;tanding all his levity, who con&s;iders his wife with a warmer degree of affection: if you have a friend&s;hip therefore, for her, let her continue in an error, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her repo&s;e, and give no hint, whatever, of his gallantries to any body.</P>

<P>You are all goodne&s;s; and the prudence with which you have conceal'd our private engage|ments, has eternally oblig'd me; had you tru&s;ted the &s;ecret even to Mrs. Belville, it wou'dn't have been &s;afe; &s;he wou'd have told her hu&s;band, and he is &s;uch a rattle&s;kul, that, notwith&s;tanding all his regard for me, he wou'd have mention'd it in &s;ome moment of levity, and &s;ent it in a cour&s;e of circulation to my father.</P>

<P>The peculiarity of your father's tem|per, join'd to my want of fortune, made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to keep our engagements inviolably &s;ecret; there is no merit, therefore, either in my prudence, or in my labouring a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to cultivate the good opinion of the General; &s;ince both were &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ece&s;|&s;ary

<P>So it was, I a&s;&s;ure you; for, in the army, being u&s;ed to nothing but command and obedience, he removes the di&s;cipline of the parade into his family, and no more expects his orders &s;hou'd be di&s;|puted, in matters of a dome&s;tic nature, than if they were deliver'd at the head of his regiment.</P>

<P>ZOUNDS! Torrington, give me quarter, when I &s;urrender up my &s;word: I own that for the&s;e twenty years, I have been &s;uffering all the incon|veniences of marriage, without ta&s;ting any one of its comforts, and rejoicing in an imaginary freedom, while I was really grovelling in chains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the dirtie&s;t chains upon earth;&mdash;yet you wou'dn't be convinc'd, but laugh'd at all your mar|ried acquaintance as &s;laves, when not one of them put up with half &s;o much from the wor&s;t wife, as you were oblig'd to crouch under, from a kept mi&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too true. But, you know, &s;he &s;acrificed much for me;&mdash;you know that &s;he was the widow of a colonel, and refus'd two very advantageous matches on my account.&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>If &s;he was the widow of a judge, and had re|fu&s;ed a high chancellor, &s;he was &s;till a devil incar|nate, and you were of cour&s;e a madman to live with her.</P>

<P>You don't remember her care of me when I have been &s;ick.&mdash;</P>

<P>I recollect, however, her u&s;age of you in health, and you may ea&s;ily find a tenderer nur&s;e, when you are bound over by the gout or the rheumati&s;m.</P>

<P>Not you indeed, when &s;he is in the que&s;tion; with every body el&s;e, your re&s;olution is as unalterable as a determination in the hou&s;e of peers; but Mrs. Tempe&s;t is your fate, and &s;he rever&s;es your decrees with as little difficulty as a fraudulent debtor now-a-days procures his certificate under a commi&s;&s;ion of bankruptcy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well if, like the Roman Fabius, I conquer by delay, in the end, there will be no great rea&s;on to find fault with my general&s;hip. The propo&s;al of parting now comes from her&s;elf.</P>

<P>The greate&s;t&mdash;do you think I'd hazard &s;uch an engagement without being perfectly &s;ure of my ground?

Why, to be &s;ure in the&s;e days, Mr. Belville, the in&s;tances of conjugal infidelity are &s;o very &s;carce, and men of fa&s;hion are &s;o remarkable for a tender attachment to their wives, that I don't wonder at your circum&s;pection&mdash;But do

<P>O, Sir, I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible of my obli|gations; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of them, was one mo|tive of my coming here.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but General, let me interpo&s;e here. If he can maintain any charge again&s;t the lady's repuation, 'twould be very hard that he &s;hould be di&s;inherited, for a nece&s;&s;ary attention to his honour.</P>

<P>My dear Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham, we are now per|fectly &s;afe, yet I will by no means intreat you to un|ma&s;k, becau&s;e I am convinc'd, from the propriety with which you repuls'd my addre&s;&s;es this morning, that you intend the pre&s;ent interview &s;hould make me &s;till more deeply &s;en&s;ible of my pre&s;umption.&mdash;I never lied &s;o aukwardly in all my life; if it was to make her comply, I &s;hould be at no lo&s;s for language.

The &s;ituation in which I mu&s;t appear before you, Ma|dam, is certainly a very humiliating one; but I am per&s;uaded that your genero&s;ity will be gratified to hear, that I have bid an everla&s;ting adieu to my pro|fligacy, and am now only alive to the virtues of Mrs. Belville.&mdash;She won't &s;peak&mdash;I don't wonder at it, for brazen as I am my&s;elf, if I met &s;o mortifying a re|jection, I &s;hould be cur&s;edly out of countenance.</P>

<P>So, Torrington, we &s;hall be able to take the field again, you &s;ee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how in the name of wonder has your &s;on found out your intention of marrying Mi&s;s Wal|&s;ingham? I look'd upon my&s;elf as the only per&s;on acquainted with the &s;ecret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That thought has march'd it&s;elf two or three times to my own recollection. For tho' I gave him &s;ome di&s;tant hints of the affair, I took parti|cular care to keep behind the works of a proper cir|cum&s;pection.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham, Capt. Savage has been telling Mr. Belville and me of a very extraor|dinary mi&s;take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very &s;trange indeed, mi&s;take on mi&s;take.</P>

<P>'Tis no way &s;trange to find every body pro|perly &s;truck with the merit of Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A compliment from you now, Mr. Belville, is really worth accepting.</P>

<P>If I thought the affair cou'd be kept a &s;e|cret, by making the town over to my &s;on, &s;ince I am utterly &s;hut out my&s;elf&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;eems exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>

<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought that;&mdash;why mortified as I mu&s;t be in giving it up, I think I cou'd re&s;olve upon the manoeuvre, to &s;ave my&s;elf from univer&s;al ridicule: but it can't be;&mdash;it can't be; and I only double my own di&s;appointment in rewarding the di&s;obedience of the ra&s;cal who has &s;upplanted me. There!&mdash;there! they are all talking of it, all laughing at me, and I &s;hall run mad!</P>

<P>True.&mdash;Can you believe &s;uch an ab&s;urdity?</P>

<P>Why, will you deny, you mi&s;erable old mummy, that you made propo&s;al of marriage to her?&mdash;</P>

<P>Shall I take a le&s;&s;on from this lady, Mr. Belville? Perhaps if the women of virtue were to pluck up a little &s;pirit, they might be &s;oon as well treated as kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have been very whim&s;ical in|deed; yet if repre&s;ented on the &s;tage, I hope they wou'd be found not only entertaining, but in&s;tructive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>In&s;tructive! why the modern Critics &s;ay that the only bu&s;ine&s;s of Comedy is to make peo|ple laugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is degrading the dignity of letters ex|ceedingly, as well as le&s;&s;ening the utility of the &s;tage &mdash;A good comedy is a capital effort of genius, and &s;hould therefore be directed to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and unle&s;s we learn &s;ome|thing while we chuckle, the carpenter who nails a Pantomime together, will be entitled to more applau&s;e, than the be&s;t comic poet in the kingdom.</P>
