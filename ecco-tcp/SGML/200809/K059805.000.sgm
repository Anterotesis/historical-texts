<P>THREE Things in this Work &s;eem to call for a Word or two of Pre|face; but I &s;hall be very Brief.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of our Impa|tience to know the Certainty of things be|fore our Governors thought fit to explain them, call'd aloud for &s;ome Reproof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Apprehen&s;ions &s;ome People were under, or pretended to be under, for our Pub|lick Credit, and for our Commerce in ca&s;e of a War, Neither of which &s;eem to be in the lea&s;t Danger, call'd (as loud) for <HI>ditto.</HI></ITEM>

Rea&s;on; and for the La&s;t, as he has taken all po&s;&s;ible Care to give no Offence, and that the whole Tenour of the Work is evi|dently calculated for the Honour, Intere&s;t, and Service of His Maje&s;ty, and the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and perfectly ab&s;tracted from all private Views or De&s;ires, He humbly hopes, no Slip of the Pen, if &s;uch &s;hould be, tho' he has with the utmo&s;t Care guarded again&s;t that al&s;o, &s;hall be mi&s;|con&s;trued to his Prejudice.</P>

THE Evident <HI>Approach</HI> of a WAR, &amp;c.</HEAD>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;hort Introduction; with a Remark upon the Impatience of &s;ome People to know before-hand whether we &s;hall have <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War.</HI> The Rea&s;on of their unea&s;y Ha&s;te; and &s;omething of Who the People are. Al&s;o an Enqui|ry whether our Stocks and Publick Credit &s;hould not Ri&s;e, rather than Fall, upon the Pro&s;pect of a War.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN all the Politicians of the Town are con|&s;ulting their Oracles upon this Important Subject, and that the fir&s;t Que&s;tion in all Conver&s;ation is, <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War?</HI> I hope if I may not give my own Opinion, I may be a little merry with tho&s;e that do.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we go to the Merit of the Ca&s;e, I cannot &s;ee why every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Freeholder may not claim a Right to talk of it, and enquire a little into it, mode&s;tly, and as becomes them; &s;ince in mo&s;t Ca&s;es that I meet with, if any Body has a Right to enquire into the Rate of a Thing, 'tis tho&s;e who pay for it.</P>
<P>War and Peace in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> are, notwith&s;tanding all our Privileges, in the Brea&s;t of the King; 'tis a Branch of the Prerogative; no Body di&s;putes it; and I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis the Prerogative of mo&s;t of the Kings of <HI>Europe</HI> al&s;o, and &s;o 'tis meet it &s;hould be.</P>
<Q><L>Let the Kings (Name a' God) make a War or a Peace,</L>
<L>Let 'em Fight, or give o'er, as their Maje&s;ties plea&s;e.</L>
<L>Let's be anxious no more, whatever's our Doom;</L>
<L>Tho' we Fight all the World, let's be Ea&s;y at Home.</L></Q>
<P>Leaving then the Superficials for the Superficial to refine upon, let us &s;ee what it is the Town is &s;o re&s;tle&s;s about. For my Part, I don't &s;ee the People I &s;peak of, half &s;o much con|cern'd about the Thing it &s;elf, as about their not knowing it <HI>before-hand;</HI> a certain Hint of their Meaning; which is, in a Word, that they want to make a Bubble of it, and that be|fore
<PB N="2" REF="5">
it begins too. Who may be bubbled by it when it comes, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And how unaccountable is this Imparience among us? Why cannot the Town be ea&s;y, and let things go on in the ordinary Cour&s;e? If a War is for our Advantage, 'twill be good News when it comes; if not, bad News comes fa&s;t enough. Let us have Patience; we mo&s;t hear of it in the End, or Taxes mu&s;t be lighter than u&s;ual in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But there is a Figure in all this Speech; More intended than is expre&s;s'd: How happens it el&s;e that tho&s;e People are mo&s;t concerned to be at a Certainty about a War, who are like to have the lea&s;t Hand in it when it comes? <HI>Latet anguis in berba.</HI></P>
<P>If a War was ju&s;t now Declared, the People who are thus eager with their Enquiries, may appear to have no manner of Concern in it, one way or other. <HI>They are always mo&s;t bu&s;y who have lea&s;t to do.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, the pre&s;ent Ha&s;te we are in to know what &s;hall be, is not a meer Curio&s;ity and Impatience, but 'tis a Bite; they want to be the fir&s;t in the Secret, and to know it before their Neighbours, for U&s;es and Purpo&s;es; and the&s;e U&s;es and Purpo&s;es are worth our Inquiry after.</P>
<P>Some are of Opinion, and I among the re&s;t, that the Curi|o&s;ity of the Times &s;hould not be &s;atisfy'd; and that much is to be learnt, tho' perhaps not &s;o much to be got, by the State of Uncertainty Men are in at this Time: At lea&s;t this is to be learnt, that People <HI>within Doors</HI> &s;ee what Fools we are <HI>with|out Doors,</HI> to think we under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>State&s;men always gain by being &s;ecret: If they have nothing at all upon the Anvil, &s;ay nothing, or mean nothing when they &s;peak, they always pa&s;s for Politicians when they are Private; and we will have it that they are wi&s;e Men when they are doing nothing, tho' it be only becau&s;e they have nothing to do.</P>
<P>But why are we <HI>without Doors</HI> &s;o impatient to know what perhaps no Body here can tell us? and why do we not en|quire where it is to be known? Is this the Place for the Que&s;tion to be &s;tarted in? Or is <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> the pro|per Center of the Intelligence?</P>
<P>Who do we ask? And why do we talk of it here? 'Tis plain his Maje&s;ty has re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve the Peace. If 'tis to be a War, I think you &s;hould ask the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Emperor, the <HI>Czarina,</HI> and tho&s;e Heroes of War the <HI>Poles,</HI> who talk of Fighting as if the World dur&s;t not look them in the Face. Happy! <HI>Strangely Happy!</HI> is this Age, that the only Nations that &s;eem eager for a War, are tho&s;e that are
<PB N="3" REF="6">
lea&s;t able to carry it on; and tho&s;e that &s;eem forwarde&s;t for Fighting, are tho&s;e that when they come to it, have been al|ways forwarde&s;t to run away.</P>
<P>To hear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> talk of fitting out Ships of War, and the <HI>Poles</HI> of rai&s;ing Armies! I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if I were to &s;peak freely upon the Subject, and any Man who I thought worth an An&s;wer &s;hould ask me Whether we &s;hould have a War with the&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites?</HI> I &s;hould an&s;wer, <HI>&s;ome little Articles excepted,</HI> I am afraid not.</P>
<P>To hear the <HI>Poles</HI> threaten the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> talk of his doing Homage to them for Part of his Country; reject the Me|morials of the Prote&s;tants, and order their Troops (their In|vincible Poltroons) to march to the Frontiers; methinks 'tis of a Piece with the Orders of their late Dyet, to di&s;po&s;e of two Millions of <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Florins, when 'tis &s;aid they have but 40000 in their Exchequer.</P>
<P>Then, as I &s;aid, to hear the <HI>Spaniard</HI> talk of fitting out 50 Ships of War, when all <HI>Spain</HI> is not able to furni&s;h 3000 Sea|men; to hear of their furni&s;hing the Emperor with three Mil|lions <HI>per Ann.</HI> by way of Sub&s;idy, when they can't bring home their Plate Fleet from Abroad, for fear of eight Men of War, and can hardly borrow 200000 Crowns in all their Seven Kingdoms at Home; The&s;e are merry Things it mu&s;t be allow'd, and fit for little el&s;e, in my Opinion, but to be laugh'd at.</P>
<P>To hear from the <HI>Baltick,</HI> that the <HI>Czarina</HI> has order'd her Fleet to be fitted out Early in the Spring, when &s;he has lately let us &s;ee, that if 20 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War appear, they dare not look abroad: And then, for fitting them out EARLY, that's another Je&s;t too, as if they could get out before we could get in; or that they could Sail over the Ice, and put to Sea when their Ports are frozen up. For my Part, I can hardly believe they talk &s;o at <HI>Petersburgh;</HI> I think they can never be &s;o &s;illy. I am rather of Opinion our News-mongers make it for them; ju&s;t as they did the other Day the <HI>French</HI> laying up great Magazines at <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> which is a City in the Hands of the Emperor, one of the Barrier Towns. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> can no more come out into the Ocean without our Leave, or without fighting our Fleet, and beating it too, than their Ships can fly over the Mountains. If they de&s;ign &s;uch things as are talk'd of, and to come into the Ocean with a Fleet, they mu&s;t change the Scene of their Marine Affairs, and go and build Men of War at <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> or in <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and then they may indeed go to Sea without Interruption; but 'till they do that, they may cea&s;e concerning them&s;elves in the Na|val
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Affairs of <HI>Europe;</HI> and if they do it, they will be little more than laugh'd at.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the terrible People to whom we &s;hould go with our Important Que&s;tion, and of whom we &s;hould &s;o &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively ask whether they plea&s;e to give <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War</HI> to the &s;o much weaker Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Great Britain. Why &s;hould we not ask of them that know?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, they are &s;carce worth our Notice in the Ca&s;e be|fore us; and that, in my Opinion, makes the Que&s;tion about <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War</HI> the le&s;s Important; and our Impatience about it &s;eems the more Enigmatick. What mighty Ha&s;te are we in? and what great Stre&s;s do we lay upon a War with &s;uch Peo|ple, as (Heaven knows) are hardly worth the Que&s;tion; and who, as the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aid once to the <HI>Mu&s;covites, hardly knew how to make War, and were not worth making Peace with.</HI></P>
<P>But to bring all this home to our Selves, and look into the In&s;ide of Things with our Eyes open, and the Mi&s;ts of Art cleared a little up; and &s;o talk &s;omething gravely to it: If the Enemies which we are like to have upon our Hands, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing a War,</HI> are &s;uch as I have hinted at, Why all this Concern about <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War</HI> with them? Why &s;o anxious to know things before-hand? Why &s;o much Noi&s;e about nothing! There mu&s;t be more in it of one Kind, if there is not of another; it cannot be all meer Curio&s;ity, meer <HI>Athe|niani&s;m;</HI> an Enquiry for meer Tittle Tattle, and for the Plea|&s;ure of a Tale.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is plain, all this Part is of a mean and &s;can|dalous Original, hardly worth naming; 'tis the ALLY, and the JOBBERS, that make the greate&s;t Part of the Noi&s;e; and they want to be an&s;wered, only that they may know how to <HI>Put</HI> and <HI>Refu&s;e,</HI> how to <HI>Sell out</HI> or <HI>Buy in,</HI> and to make a Bubble of the War before it begins.</P>
<P>Now as this is in it &s;elf a Trifle not worth &s;pending two Words about, much le&s;s to ground &s;uch a Clamour upon; a thing below Reproof, too mean for Satyr, has neither Je&s;t or Earne&s;t in it, and circulates between the F&mdash;s and the K&mdash;s only; beginning and ending within and among them&s;elves; &s;o I had not dirty'd my Fingers with it here, only to in|troduce a Superior Enquiry with it, and which may be of &s;ome U&s;e to us to &s;peak of upon this Occa&s;ion, and &s;ome o|thers al&s;o that may follow.</P>
<P>This more &s;ignificant Enquiry is as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why &s;hould the Certainty of a War or of a Peace influ|ence the Price of our Stocks, that is to &s;ay, the Publick Cre|dit, one way or other?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">
'Tis indeed for the &s;ake of this Que&s;tion that I mention the&s;e People, and begin my Di&s;cour&s;e with what would o|therwi&s;e look &s;o trifling. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if the Que&s;tion was put another way, I could give a more direct An&s;wer to it, and &s;upport that An&s;wer with better Rea&s;ons: <HI>I mean thus;</HI> If the Que&s;tion was, Whether the Certainty of a Peace or War ought to influence the Publick Credit, and the Price of Stocks, one way or other: I &s;ay, if this was the Que&s;tion, I &s;hould, without the lea&s;t He&s;itation, an&s;wer in the <HI>Negative;</HI> it ought not any way to affect the Credit or the Funds, no, not in the lea&s;t; and 'tis unaccountably fooli&s;h that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould incline to give it one way or other, and &s;ay which way &s;hould the Publick Credit be mo&s;t affected, I &s;hould an&s;wer, That a War &s;hould make Stocks ri&s;e, not &s;ink them; and I &s;hould value my &s;elf much more upon my little Intere&s;t among them, in Ca&s;e of a War, than in View of a Peace; and I may come to give you my Rea&s;ons for this al|&s;o, in their Place.</P>
<P>It is true, it pa&s;s'd for a Maxim of War in the Time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> Never to de&s;pi&s;e an Enemy; but 'tis as good a Maxim, tho' not &s;o Antient, Not to <HI>Over-rate</HI> an Enemy. <HI>He that is afraid before he fights, will be &s;ure to be beaten.</HI></P>
<P>To run down our E&s;tates, &s;ink the Value of our Funds, Sell out in a Hurry, and abate the Publick Credit becau&s;e of a War, and &s;uch a War as this too! What is it but Fear? nay, 'tis wor&s;e, 'tis a Fright; and without De&s;pi&s;ing our Ene|my (that may be) 'tis Rating him much too high. As <HI>Spain</HI> is not &s;o Incon&s;iderable as not to be worth our Preparations, &s;o I am &s;ure it is not &s;o Con&s;iderable as to be worth our Appre|hen&s;ions; their Power &s;eems but to make the War half a Je&s;t, and &s;ure their Threatnings and Swagger ought to be far from turning it into Earne&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot but think there is &s;ome Similitude between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> talking of a War, and their late Prohibition of our Manufacturers; they prepare for War without Money, and they prohibit Trade without Clothes.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they tell us, forbids his People to wear any of the Manufactures of Wool or Silk, made in other Countries; and yet 'tis plain they can make none of their own; &s;o that 'tis a kind of a Proclamation for the People to go naked.</P>
<P>Let them take away the Manufactures of <HI>England, France,</HI> and the Seventeen Provinces, and tell us, if they can, what their People mu&s;t wear? the poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> may indeed be careful,
<PB N="6" REF="9">
notwith&s;tanding the Scripture Prohibition, about <HI>wherewithal they &s;hall be clothed.</HI> Not the Prie&s;ts have a Ca&s;&s;ock, not the Nuns a Veil, not the Gentlemen a Cloak, or the Ladies a Robe, I might have &s;aid a Smock, but what are made of &s;ome foreign Manufacture. They have not one Manufacture or Material to make it of, in the whole Dominion, which we now call <HI>Spain,</HI> that can amount to the cloathing of the Inha|bitants of one Province, nay hardly of one City.</P>
<P>They have Wool indeed, but by it &s;elf 'tis too &s;oft, too fine, and too tender to work, nor will it make any Manu|facture of Value, unle&s;s they could get Wool of a coar&s;er kind to mix with it. They have a little Silk, but no Quantity. They have neither Hemp or Flax. In a Word, they prohibit the Commerce ju&s;t as they &s;eem to make War, to &s;how their Teeth, or rather to &s;how that they have no Teeth. As they have no Ma|nufactures to &s;ub&s;titute in the room of tho&s;e they prohibit, &s;o they have no Ships to defend the Trade they would exclude us from.</P>
<P>Never Nation went to War in the Circum&s;tances which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mu&s;t now, if they do make a War of it; and that makes me think &s;ometimes they are not in earne&s;t, that it is all Grimace, and a kind of <HI>Quixoti&s;me;</HI> For the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> take them ab&s;tracted from their particular Re&s;entments, were always reckoned a wi&s;e con&s;idering Nation. They have made War in former Ages, and &s;ometimes with Succe&s;s; as under tho&s;e truly Great Princes, the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V, and <HI>Philip</HI> II; and &s;ince that in Confederacy with &s;ome or other of the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> that were in Condition to &s;upport them at Sea: and we may &s;ay there was &s;ome Sen&s;e in that Part; be|cau&s;e their Weakne&s;s at Sea being &s;upported, they in &s;ome mea&s;ure could pre&s;erve their <HI>American</HI> Corre&s;pondence; re|ceive Supplies of Trea&s;ure by their Plate Fleets, and could have the Support of Troops, if wanted, either by Land or by Sea; as was their Ca&s;e in their late Wars again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> and afterwards again&s;t the pre&s;ent Emperor, when they were &s;up|ported by <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t, the Confederates guarded their Flota's, and convoyed their Ships by Sea; in the Second, the <HI>French</HI> marched powerful Armies to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance by Land; and yet in both tho&s;e Wars, <HI>Spain</HI> &s;uffered &s;ometimes prodigious Lo&s;&s;es; as in the Fir&s;t by the <HI>French,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> when Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Pointy</HI> took <HI>Carthagena;</HI> and in the La&s;t, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Vigo,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But now they have not an Allie that can help them by Land, or by Sea; no not one: and yet they want to make a War! 'Tis an&s;wered, the Emperor is their Allie, and his Armies
<PB N="7" REF="10">
are powerful, his Troops good, his Generals the be&s;t of the Age (that is to &s;ay, being interpreted, <HI>&s;ome of the be&s;t</HI>) and that he will &s;upport them with all his Forces.</P>
<P>As to the Imperial Support, we &s;hall have room to &s;peak of it when we come to &s;ee how well the Emperor will &s;upport him&s;elf and his own Country; but for the pre&s;ent, as it re|lates to <HI>Spain,</HI> I may take notice, that perhaps the Emperor might &s;upport, or at lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if he knew how to come at them; but which way will that be done? and up|on what Foundation does the Emperor propo&s;e to do it, or the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to expect it.?</P>
<P>By Land it is impracticable, unle&s;s the Imperial Troops ap|pointed for it could fir&s;t fight their way from <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> thro' the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o enter <HI>Spain</HI> by Land; for by Sea they cannot pretend to it; the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and perhaps <HI>French</HI> Squadrous lying directly in the Way to inter|cept them.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;urrounded on every Side by Land, way-laid on every Side by Sea, they can neither be &s;uc|coured by Troops from their Friends, or &s;upplied with Mo|ney from their own Dominions; and yet the&s;e are the People of whom we mu&s;t enquire whether we &s;hall have War or Peace; and with whom if we have a War, our Bubble|makers pretend, the Stocks mu&s;t fall, and the publick Funds &s;ink in their Value! What Rea&s;ons they can give for it, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am at a Lo&s;s to find.</P>
<P>It is true there are Facts and Events which frequently of|fer to our View, of which we can only &s;ay <HI>they are,</HI> not why or for what Rea&s;on they exi&s;t; as &s;ome <HI>Phoenomena</HI> ap|pear in the Heavens which are &s;trange and unaccountable, and of which our be&s;t A&s;tronomers can &s;ay <HI>they are,</HI> rather than give any Account from whence or by what Powers in Na|ture they exi&s;t; what their Motions and Revolutions are, or how performed; &s;uch as Comets, &s;urpri&s;ing Meteors, Balls of Fire, and other Appearances in the Air.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>Aenigma,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Arcana,</HI> in the Coun|cils of that part of the World, and they mu&s;t have &s;ome De|pendances which we can &s;ee no room for, and can make no probable Gue&s;&s;es at; or el&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem to be the mo&s;t void of Council, or their Council (&s;uch as they are) the mo&s;t void of Sen&s;e, of any People now acting as a Nation, and in the Ca|pacity of a Monarchy, in the World. I know nothing can be more wonderful in the Cour&s;e of all the Politicks of <HI>Europe</HI> than their pre&s;ent Conduct; nor in my Opinion can a greater Prodigy happen in the World, unle&s;s it &s;hould be to &s;ee them
<PB N="8" REF="11">
come well off at la&s;t, which I would not In&s;ure under 100 <HI>per</HI> Cent.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, and the abundant Patience of His Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, waiting the ntmo&s;t Length of Time, trying all pacifick Mea&s;ures, and offering beyond what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to expect, in order to pre|vail with them not to run into a War which they are in no Condition to carry on: I &s;ay, the&s;e are the only Rea&s;ons that would per&s;wade me to think &s;till that it would not be a War: my Meaning is, I cannot think the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o entirely abandon'd, &s;o given up to their Piques and per&s;onal Re&s;ent|ments, &s;o blind again&s;t their own Intere&s;t and Safety, &s;o in|fatuated and re&s;olved for their own Ruin, as to run head|long into a War, which in all human Probability mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue in their Lo&s;s, if not in the utter De&s;truction of their Intere&s;t, and perhaps of their very Government: of which I &s;hall &s;ay more in its order.</P>
<P>And is this the War that mu&s;t &s;ink our Stocks! Will any Man Sell out, as they call it, for the Apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch a War as this! Let the <HI>Bear-skin Men</HI> that build upon that Pro&s;pect, depend upon it, that whatever U&s;e they make of the Word <HI>War,</HI> which I know is a formidable Word, and is of late made, as we call it, a Term of Art in their way, to run down the Price of things, and make their Game of among them&s;elves; yet upon the whole, it will go but a little way, and they them&s;elves will buy their own Stock up again in a very few Days, after they have Bubbled it out in a Fright with|out ground.</P>
<P>The many frequent Occa&s;ions in which tho&s;e People have been thus taken in their own Snares, are not worth our No|tice, tho' they are very well worth theirs, that they may learn to be wi&s;er: The Stocks which fall by this Art will never lie there, but will ccertainly advance with the greater Reflux, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t Judgment of &s;uch a War is pa&s;s'd; and not to make the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem meaner and more de&s;picable than they are, the little Rea&s;on there can be to lay any Stre&s;s upon their Part of the War, or to rai&s;e any Pannicks among us from the Pro&s;pect of it, the more a&s;hamed the&s;e People will be of having &s;unk the Rate of things upon that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, if this Matter was examined, that the Gentlemen who are now &s;o impatient to have this &s;ecret Intelligence, put much more Weight upon them&s;elves than the World may think fit to put upon them; believing that as they plea&s;e to Rate their Stocks, &s;o the re&s;t of the World &s;hould Rate the War.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
War is a terrible Word, and were it circum&s;tanced in any manner but as this with <HI>Spain</HI> &s;eems to be, there might be &s;omething of Foundation for it; But Rea&s;on dictates that we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h according to the particular People we are to engage with. Now if any good Politician will tell us what Nation in the World it could be wi&s;h'd we &s;hould differ with rather than <HI>Spain;</HI> then I'll allow they might &s;ugge&s;t a Fall of Stocks upon the Rupture.</P>
<P>But where is the Nation of the World that we can get more by, and are likely to lo&s;e le&s;s by, in ca&s;e of a War? In how many Places in the World are they expo&s;ed even to our Adventurers and Letter-of-Mart Men, where they cannot de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t five hundred Men, and yet have im|men&s;e Riches to lo&s;e? How ea&s;ie is it, not only to in&s;ult their <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Colonies, but even to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and to take from them the immen&s;e Riches of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI></P>
<P>This adds to our Wonder in behalf of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> makes the Infatuation appear the more gro&s;s, and &s;eems to be &s;till a Rea&s;on why we &s;hould think there can be no War; that is to &s;ay, that I think the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can never carry on the Je&s;t &s;o far. People in their Sen&s;es never run great Hazards, where they have much to lo&s;e; and as we know His Maje&s;ty has ta|ken all the wi&s;e Mea&s;ures to pre&s;erve Peace, we cannot &s;up|po&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can come into a War, unle&s;s they are fallen under &s;ome National Infatuation.</P>
<P>For a Nation to quarrel that are not able to fight, to make a War when they are &s;ure to lo&s;e by it, and have &s;o much to lo&s;e too, is a Token of in&s;ufferable Stupidity.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on I would clo&s;e the Account thus, <HI>viz. No War,</HI> unle&s;s the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are mad; 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> can never come into a War without a Bla&s;t upon their politick Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding; and 'tis &s;till more irrational to think, that a War with &s;uch a Nation can be any Foun|dation for the running down our Stocks and Funds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Advantages of a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and the good Terms on which it might, and probably may, be carried on by <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I &s;hall take that into Con&s;ideration by it &s;elf, when the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and of their pre&s;ent Conduct, may be farther illu&s;trated as it de&s;erves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That Some may be allowed to enquire, and &s;hould, if po&s;|&s;ible, be informed of the Approach of a War before it is begun; and that it is ju&s;t in a Government to give them as much Information as they conveniently can.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving thus touch'd gently the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of our pre&s;ent Impatience about Peace and War, and how far &s;ome People make a Bubble of the Enquiry, as they would do afterwards of the Di&s;covery, and of the Thing it&s;elf; I mu&s;t add, that after all, and ab&s;tracting the Thing from tho&s;e jobbing De&s;igns, which we mu&s;t acknowledge are mean and low-priz'd enough, yet there are &s;ome People in the World who are ju&s;tly concern'd to enquire, and anxious to know too, what will be the I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things; and this upon a better Account, and who have very hone&s;t Rea&s;ons for their Enquiries; and it is on their Account that the&s;e Sheets are made publick.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Merchants abroad</HI> are concerned to make a Judg|ment of things: Many of the&s;e being &s;ettled in the Ports and Dominions of &s;uch Princes and Powers as may be or are like to be Enemies in ca&s;e of a Rupture, 'tis of Importance to them to have as early an Account of things as they can; that they may &s;ecure their Per&s;ons and Effects in time from the Violences frequently made u&s;e of on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and this may be one Rea&s;on why our Letters from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> and other Parts of the World are full of importuning Enquiries about it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The In&s;urers,</HI> who are far from being an incon&s;iderable Body among the Merchants at home, have Rea&s;on to be con|cerned in the Enquiry; for that being to under-write Policies which are of very great Value, and in&s;ure upon Ships and Cargoes going long Voyages, 'tis of the la&s;t Importance to them to know what Ri&s;que they may run, in order to know what Premio's to take, &s;aited to the Times that are to come.</P>
<P>As things may happen, many Ships may go out in Peace and come back in War; or they may go out in Peace, and a War break out before they arrive at the Port they are in|&s;ured to; &s;o that the In&s;urer knows not what Hazard he runs, or how to &s;uit his Demand; nor does the In&s;ured know what Premio to give, any more than the other knows what to ask.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
Trade &s;hould not be embarra&s;&s;ed with Uncertainties, or with unfore&s;een Hazards. The Merchant has in all Ages been much the Care of wi&s;e and ju&s;t Governors; they are a u&s;e|ful and valuable Part of the Common-wealth, and their Inte|re&s;t &s;hould be regarded on all Occa&s;ions: The Welfare of the Community very much depends upon the Safety of the Mer|chants and of their Effects: By them the People are employed, the Navigation encouraged, Numbers of Sailors main|tained and bred up, the Revenue encrea&s;ed, and the great Ar|ticle of Commerce carried on and continued in this King|dom.</P>
<P>They that venture their E&s;tates and Per&s;ons abroad, that e&s;tabli&s;h Factories, &s;ettle Hou&s;es, and give Commi&s;&s;ions for buying and &s;elling in foreign Parts, &s;hould not be kept in Ig|norance and in the Dark, 'till the very la&s;t Moment of a Rupture. The Government will not leave them to the Mercy of the Enemies, betray them into the hands of Violence; or give them up at lea&s;t without a due Concern for them, and without giving them time to &s;hift for them&s;elves, to &s;ecure their Effects, and to avoid the impending Storm.</P>
<P N="3">3. In like ca&s;e the <HI>Merchants at home</HI> &s;hipping off daily large Quantities of Goods for foreign Parts, it would look particularly unkind to expo&s;e them to ingulph them&s;elves and their Fortunes in the publick Re&s;entment, if it may be avoid|ed; leaving them to pu&s;h on their Trade in Security, un|der the Protection of Peace, while a War is in the very Em|brio, and as it were ju&s;t breaking out; in which ca&s;e they would often find them&s;elves on the &s;udden &s;urprized, their E&s;tates confi&s;cated and &s;eized upon, and their Factors abroad ruined and undone.</P>
<P>It has been u&s;ual for Governments to give their Merchants private Hints in &s;uch Ca&s;es, not only not to run farther Ha|zards, not to launch out by continuing to &s;hip off farther and greater Stocks of Goods, but to take care in time of the Effects they have already abroad; to di&s;po&s;e and &s;ecure them, that they may not be expo&s;ed to the Enemies; and when a Government does not do &s;o, 'tis rea&s;onable to conclude there is really no Danger.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Ma&s;ters and Owners of Ships</HI> are concerned and may ju&s;tly be anxious to know whether Peace or War is in the View of the State they live under, that they may man and arm their Ships in proportion to the Circum&s;tances of things; other|wi&s;e if they go out weak, and a War breaks out, they are made a Prey to Rovers and Privateers; if they go out &s;trong, and the Peace continues, they are at a needle&s;s Expence in
<PB N="12" REF="15">
hiring more Men than they want, and laying in greater Stores than they have Occa&s;ion for; all which eats into, or rather eats out, the Profits of the Voyage.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>very Seamen them&s;elves</HI> are ju&s;tly concern'd in the Enquiry; for as, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, the Rate of Seamens Wa|ges bears a Proportion to the Ri&s;ques they run, and to the Dangers they may fall into; &s;o 'tis a Wrong to the poor Men to &s;hip them&s;elves at the ordinary Wages, if a War is at hand; and 'tis a Wrong to Trade to be obliged to pay advanced Wages, and con&s;equently Advance of Freight for Goods, in view of a War, if no War is intended.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Trade&s;men at home</HI> are concern'd to know, whether there is likely to be Peace or War, that they may know what and when to buy or &s;ell, when to lay in Stocks and Stores of Goods, and when not: If a War be in View, 'tis the Trade&s;man's Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tore him&s;elf with &s;uch Goods as are Imported from Abroad before the Price advances, before the Hazards of War make them uncertain in their Arriving, and as well in Time as in Quantity. The <HI>Vintner</HI> lays in a Stock of Wines, and buys freely, that he may not be forc'd to buy in a Scarcity; the <HI>Dyer</HI> lays in a Stock of Cocheneal and Indigo, Gauls and Gums, that he may work as cheap as before, if po&s;&s;ible, and his Merchants not go from him to a|nother; the Country <HI>Clothier,</HI> if he hears of a War, lays in a Stock of Oil for his Carders and Combers, and of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool for his fine Clothes; that if a War happens, he may not be out of Goods for the carrying on his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and be forc'd to buy Dearer than his Neighbours.</P>
<P>Again; if the&s;e Trade&s;men buy, if they lay in a Stock of Goods with a pro&s;pect of War, and no War happens; if the Seller u&s;es Art to deceive them, and per&s;wade them that there will be a War, <HI>(as is often done)</HI> and no War follows: I &s;ay, the&s;e Trade&s;men are hurt extremely, they are clog'd with Goods, run out Stocks, got deep into Debt, and the Rate of their own Goods not at all rai&s;ed; &s;o that they are irrepa|rably weaken'd by the Di&s;appointment, and &s;ometimes ruin'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, with many of the like, ju&s;tify the Enquiries of the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s (e&s;pecially) into the Po&s;ture of pub|lick Affairs, and whether they are likely to i&s;&s;ue in Peace or War; and it is in Con&s;ideration of the&s;e that I enter thus in|to the Enquiry. As for our Friends of the <HI>Jobbing</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, they are a Nation by them&s;elves, and we have nothing to do with them in the Ca&s;e; nor are they otherwi&s;e worth taking notice of, except as before.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">
Since then there are &s;ome People to whom it is rea&s;onable we &s;hould give as much Light into things as we can, Con&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Intere&s;t; let us for their Sakes enquire a lit|tle how things &s;tand in the World, and what we may rea|&s;onably expect, as well from the face of things abroad, as at home. Perhaps they may take &s;ome Light from our Enquiries, which they would not have before.</P>
<P>As things now pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our View, there &s;eems to be more rational Gue&s;&s;es to be made, and a better Judgment to be form'd from Abroad, than from at Home; at lea&s;t as far as we may judge from the Out&s;ides and Appearan|ces of Publick Affairs, and as far as we are allow'd to &s;earch into them, and pa&s;s our Judgment upon them.</P>
<P>'Tis evident the Councils of <HI>Great Britain</HI> tend to Peace, if to be obtain'd with ju&s;t and honourable Conditions: Peace, if attended with the good Under&s;tanding of Princes, and an agreeable Regard to the Treaties and Engagements already entered into, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Nations, to the Advantage of all Sides, and with Support of the Laws, Re|ligion and Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Great Britain</HI> quarrels with no body; we de&s;ire no War, &s;o that our Neighbours are not oppre&s;s'd, our Commerce invaded, new Trades and Corre&s;pondencies opened, which were formerly by evident and exclu&s;ive Sti|pulations clos'd and &s;hut up. <HI>Great Britain</HI> is a Trading Na|tion, and trading Nations never covet War. Peace is a Friend of Commerce, and Trade flouri&s;hes under the Banner of the general Tranquility.</P>
<P>But the Government of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> nor of its Allies, who are generally trading Nations too, mu&s;t not be in&s;ulted, mu&s;t not be run down, much le&s;s their Commerce invaded and &s;upplanted. Their Power is always exerted to protect their Trade; 'tis their Bu&s;ine&s;s to keep the Seas open, the Ports open, and all the Doors of Commerce open for their Mer|chants, and for their Ships; and, as I &s;aid before, if this can|not be done by peaceable and quiet Means, they mu&s;t do it by Force, and &s;o they are as ready for War as other People.</P>
<P>'Tis for this that the&s;e Nations keep up &s;uch a Military Force; &s;uch Fleets and &s;uch Armies to protect their Trade, to keep all the Back-doors open, to clear the Seas of Pyrates and Privateers, the Sea-Ports from Prohibitions and Repri&s;als, and to keep the Sea-Ports of all Nations free, and patent for their Ships, and for their Merchants; and if this be ob&s;tructed by Force, they mu&s;t u&s;e Force to repel it; if this cannot be obtained without a War, a War mu&s;t be ex|pected, and to me &s;eems to be unavoidable.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">
Now the Que&s;tion before us in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is very &s;hort; Do the combin'd Nations, who &s;eem now to op|po&s;e the Treaty of <HI>Hanover,</HI> &s;eek to invade the Com|merce of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or do they not? Do they &s;eek to undermine and &s;upplant us, or no? Do the <HI>O&s;tend Company,</HI> under the Imperial Eagle, invade our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, or do they not? Do they fit our Ships for Parts, which by &s;everal Treaties and Agreements they are obliged not to do, and do not u&s;e to fit out Ships for? Do they trade to Places whither they ought not, even by Agreement, to Trade? and is this done by Force, and with Menaces of a Continuance of &s;uch Trade, and of re&s;enting the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition to it? If this be &s;o, then I think no Man of Trade need to enquire whether we &s;hall think fit to renew a War for the Recovery of the Trade, &s;eeing the War is begun already by the&s;e Aggre&s;&s;ions and In|va&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the Intervals of Peace which we &s;eem to have had, were ob|tained by the Sword. The fir&s;t War between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which held forty Years, was clo&s;ed by the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> in which the Rights of Commerce, as well as of Government, were all adju&s;ted, &s;ettled and determin'd, and have remained &s;o peaceably ever &s;ince, in mo&s;t Parts on that &s;ide the World. If the&s;e Rights of Commerce are invaded, you need ask no Que|&s;tions about it, the War is begun there. Be&s;ides this, the &s;e|veral Treaties with <HI>Spain,</HI> and between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have generally adju&s;ted the Commerce, as well as the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal Countries; and the &s;ettling of Trade has been to the&s;e Nations as E&s;&s;ential, as the &s;ettling of Peace, and was always made a Part of it.</P>
<P>The Conditions on which the <HI>Netherlands</HI> have been a&s;|&s;igned to this or that Prince, have been always &s;ettled and adju&s;ted by the &s;everal Powers, with &s;uitable Re&s;erves to Trade, &s;uch as &s;erv'd for a Guarantee of the Commerce on either Hand: By the&s;e Treaties &s;uch and &s;uch Prohibitions have been taken off and laid on, by which the Intere&s;ts of Trade on either of their Boundaries have been pre&s;erv'd and taken care of.</P>
<P>If the Faith of Treaties is to be pre&s;erv'd inviolable in Matters of Peace and War, in Matters of Government and Dominion, in the Rights of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Claims of Sovereignty, and not in Matters of Trade; why are the Af|fairs of Commerce, and the free Intercour&s;e of the Subjects one with another, mention'd in the&s;e Treaties? Why are the Liberties and Re&s;trictions of Trade &s;tipulated among other things in tho&s;e Treaties? They are not Articles made on purpo&s;e to be
<PB N="15" REF="18">
broken; there is no Re&s;erve made again&s;t them, no Excep|tion; 'tis no where &s;aid that the Breach of tho&s;e Clau&s;es &s;hall not be taken for a Breach of the Peace.</P>
<P>On the contrary, tho&s;e Articles of Commerce have all a|long been looked upon as E&s;&s;ential to the good Under&s;tan|ding between tho&s;e reconciled Nations as any of the re&s;t, and the Breach of them is generally one of the fir&s;t things complained of.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot then I take the Liberty to &s;ay the War is begun already; for the Enemy have invaded us, and refu&s;ed to put a &s;top to their Inva&s;ions. I am told that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> both complain of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation's being Aggre&s;&s;ors; and that blocking up their Fleets, whether for War or Trade, is an actual Inva&s;ion, that lying before their Ports is an act of Ho&s;tility, and that in a word the War is begun on this Side.</P>
<P>I am not to enter into a Ju&s;tification of what they &s;ay, but I ballance it with this: Inva&s;ion of the Commerce is as much an act of Ho&s;tility, &s;trictly, as Inva&s;ion of the Land; the Li|berties and exclu&s;ive Rights of Trade being as much a Part of the Peace, as a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;tilities; and if our Trade be invaded contrary to expre&s;s Stipulations, the Peace is broken. As for our Squadrons appearing ready to keep the Peace, where apparent Preparations are made to break it, it may be complain'd of, and they do make &s;ome Noi&s;e about it; but I cannot &s;ee how they can make that Part be called an Act of Ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron lay off of <HI>Revel,</HI> or any where el&s;e on the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Coa&s;t, demanding an An&s;wer to the En|quiries made concerning their Preparations for War, and that they would explain them&s;elves upon the Subject of their fit|ting out a Fleet in time of profound Peace, it is no more than what has been u&s;ual in all Ages, when Princes and Powers make Preparations of War, while their Neighbours are all at Peace with them: For Example;</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dutch</HI> in a time of profound Peace fitted out a Fleet of &s;ixty Men of War for the Expedition of the then Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> ordered his Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague</HI> to ask the Meaning of it, and to threaten the <HI>States,</HI> that if it was meant again&s;t the King of <HI>England,</HI> he (the King of <HI>France</HI>) &s;hould take it as a Declara|tion of War again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now if it be objected that this was done by an Amba&s;&s;a|dor, not by a Fleet; 'tis an&s;wer'd, The <HI>French</HI> King indeed had not a Fleet at that time, but he threatned them directly with
<PB N="16" REF="19">
an immediate War, which was the &s;ame thing; and as &s;oon as it appeared that the De&s;ign was again&s;t the King of <HI>En|gland,</HI> he drew his Armies down to the Frontiers of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and hovered about them, (the &s;ame thing as blocking up a Port) and at la&s;t took the Field publickly, and began an open War.</P>
<P>I might give a great many more Examples of the like, but this is &s;ufficient. The Preparations for War made by the Court of <HI>Petersburg,</HI> their fitting out a Fleet, and drawing down an Army to the Coa&s;t, gave &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to their Neighbours to ask the Meaning of it: And to what Purpo&s;e was an Enquiry at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, without a Force &s;ufficient to act as Occa&s;ion &s;hould require, and as the An&s;wer that was to be receiv'd &s;hould direct?</P>
<P>Had the An&s;wer been Satisfactory, 'tis probable the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron had return'd &s;ooner; but as the An&s;wer was not &s;o Satisfactory, the Fleet continued there waiting the Event; and where's the act of Ho&s;tility in all this? I &s;ee nothing but what is u&s;ual in the ordinary Practice of Princes; much more was it nece&s;&s;ary at this time on many Accounts, too long to enter upon here.</P>
<P>Nor is the Re&s;entment which we hear of on the other Side, the lea&s;t Di&s;covery of the good Effect of tho&s;e Mea&s;ures. No doubt it was a Di&s;appointment to the great De&s;igns of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Empre&s;s; put a &s;top to the Enterprizes ju&s;t ripe to be begun, and has &s;hut up all the &s;ecret Re&s;olves of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Cabinet; &s;o that we know nothing of the Scheme they had laid, other than we are left to gue&s;s at by the Na|ture of the thing, and by the Apprehen&s;ions and Jealou&s;ies which tho&s;e Preparations rai&s;ed in the Councils of their Neighbours; Some of which had certainly before now been engaged in a War with the Empre&s;s of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> or at lea&s;t with the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> in who&s;e Behalf all the&s;e Prepara|tions &s;eem to have been made.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> who block up the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate-Fleet at <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> and which the Ene|my complain of as an act of Ho&s;tility, and upon which they pretend the War is begun on this Side; the &s;ame Argument, and the &s;ame Example fully an&s;wer it: The blocking up the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet with which it was aparent they de&s;igned to begin a War, and blocking up the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Money, with|out which we know they are but ill able to begin, much le&s;s to carry on a War, &s;eem to me to be the very &s;ame thing, and that with no Difference at all, except only the Variation of the Circum&s;tance, and calling the Plate-Fleet an Army,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
an Alliance and a Confederacy of Armies, drawing together for a War; all which they indeed are in Effect; for Money appropriated for War, is War in Embrio, 'tis all that Fleets and Armies are, or may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in De&s;ign; and it would &s;oon &s;how it &s;elf, had the <HI>Spaniards</HI> tho&s;e Sinews to &s;trengthen their Councils with, and to pur&s;ue the Mea&s;ures which they have vi&s;ibly engaged in.</P>
<P>So that in all the&s;e things 'tis evident <HI>Great Britain</HI> has only acted by way of Prevention, and has hitherto only held the Hands of the quarrelling Powers, and &s;aid to them; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ye &s;hall not fall out; if ye will make Peace, be quiet, and accommo|date things rea&s;onably, well and good, but quarrel you &s;hall not, and fight you &s;hall not.'</Q></P>
<P>If this has been &s;poken &s;omething Magi&s;terially, and with an Air of Influence, as if we had Power to command them to be quiet; I &s;ay, If it has, (I do not &s;ay it has) 'tis our Felicity, 'tis <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Glory, that &s;he is in a Condition to en|force her Propo&s;als, tho' of Peace, with a hand of Power; &s;eeing &s;till that Power is exerted but for the Good of Man|kind, and to keep the World quiet: 'tis a kind of Imitation of Heaven, who, tho' its Plea&s;ure is enforc'd as a Command, yet it is &s;o for the apparent Good of the World, that they can find it no Grievance to obey.</P>
<P>But our Enemies, they &s;ay, take this for an Act of Ho&s;tility, that the War is begun by us, and &s;o conclude that they will carry it on as a War in other Places; adding, that we may depend it mu&s;t be a War, unle&s;s the Re&s;traint upon their Plate-Fleet be taken off; if &s;o, then the Que&s;tion is an&s;wer'd, for we &s;ee no room to believe the Re&s;traint will be yet taken off, nay I mu&s;t grant that we can &s;ee no rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>This being the true State of the Ca&s;e, I think the People, who I &s;ay &s;hould be inform'd, need not wait for any further Information, but may, without any Breach of Prudence, act as if a War was in View; I will not &s;ay Inevitable, becau&s;e many things may intervene, but Probable; and that &s;o proba|ble, that if they are deceived, and run any Hazards on the contrary Pre&s;umption, it mu&s;t be their own Fault.</P>

<P>Having thus &s;tated the Powers, it would be natural to ex|amine a little the Occa&s;ion of the &s;uppo&s;ed Differences, and which, in ca&s;e of a War, may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be called the Quarrel.</P>
<P>As to any Private or Per&s;onal Piques and Re&s;entment which may add to the Grounds of the Quarrel, and may give Jealou&s;ies on either hand among the Princes concern'd, tho' I might take notice of &s;everal almo&s;t among them all; &s;uch as the &s;ending home the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> e&s;pou&s;ing King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> the Affair of <HI>Thorn,</HI> the e&s;pou&s;ing the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> with &s;everal others nearer Home, which I could enter into the Debate of, I pur|po&s;ely omit them here; being, as is &s;aid before, re&s;olved to give no Offence; and as I am &s;peaking without Doors, I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to &s;uch Things as Pre&s;ent to common Ob&s;er|vation only.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret, and at that time &s;urprizing Alliance, clapt up on a &s;udden, between the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and of <HI>Spain,</HI> and which is therefore call'd <HI>the Treaty of Vienna,</HI> was the fir&s;t thing that gave Umbrage to the Prote&s;tant Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> Particularly they &s;eem'd to be alarm'd at &s;ome &s;ecret Ar|ticles which were not at fir&s;t made Publick, or communicat|ed to them, when the re&s;t of the Treaty was notified by the Mini&s;ters of the Parties concern'd.</P>
<P>Upon the publi&s;hing this Treaty, and the &s;aid Powers of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> appearing bu&s;ily employ'd to engage other Powers to come into it, as an Alliance or Confederacy; his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty, being then in <HI>Germany,</HI> thought it time al&s;o to
<PB N="20" REF="23">
draw together the &s;everal Powers in other Intere&s;ts, to form an oppo&s;ite League or Alliance; which Alliance is &s;aid to be wholly Defen&s;ive, and therefore entirely Pacific, being form'd merely in order to balance the &s;aid Treaty of <HI>Vienna;</HI> and this is called the Treaty of <HI>Hanover;</HI> into which the Neighbouring Powers mention'd above, were invited to join al&s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t pointing Clau&s;e, which appeared in this new-concerted Alliance or Treaty of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and which gave Umbrage to the &s;aid oppo&s;ite Powers, was a conced|ed Liberty of Commerce granted by <HI>Spain</HI> to the Subjects of the Emperor, to carry on a Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> not only injurious to the &s;everal Nations of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> but directly contrary to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with, &s;everal &s;olemn Treaties and Con|ventions actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between tho&s;e &s;everal Powers, and on the Conditions of which the Emperor enjoys the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Country, in which this Liberty of Commerce is made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>This the Members of the &s;aid <HI>Hanover</HI> Alliance in&s;i&s;t, is an Inva&s;ion of their Rights, and a manife&s;t Breach of the &s;aid &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Treaties and Conventions; and have not been wanting in all po&s;&s;ible, tho' yet peaceable Applications, at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in order to convince his Imperial Maje&s;ty that the &s;aid Commerce, and particularly the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Compa|ny, erected and carried on in con&s;equence of that conceded Liberty, is a Breach of the Publick Faith engaged in tho&s;e Treaties, and an Inva&s;ion of the Rights and Properties of the &s;aid Powers, and repre&s;enting that they could not on any Terms con&s;ent to its being carried on.</P>
<P>The&s;e Applications have been hitherto in vain, or at lea&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful; both the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> refu&s;ing to yield to the ju&s;t Demands of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies; they at the &s;ame time &s;eeming rather to re&s;ent, than comply with tho&s;e Demands, and to arm and draw together their Intere&s;ts, &s;trengthning them&s;elves by farther and farther Alliances, and carrying on already a kind of War of Negotiation, in order to appear formidable, and to be really &s;o in ca&s;e of a Rupture; menacing the Allies with their intended Attacks of &s;ome of the &s;aid <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> or in the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things have ju&s;tly moved the &s;aid <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies to Arm al&s;o both by Sea and Land; and not only by powerful Fleets to appear at the &s;everal Ports where &s;uch Powers have been drawing together to carry on their De&s;igns, but have, by the Awe of tho&s;e Fleets, kept the &s;aid Powers from
<PB N="21" REF="24">
making any Attempt, and from breaking the Peace by the In|va&s;ion of their Neighbours, as they mo&s;t certainly de&s;igned to do.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, a Squadron has been &s;ent to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> as well to bring off the Ships which are, in the Faith of former Treaties, Trading within the Dominions and in the Ports of <HI>Spain;</HI> as to put a Stop, for the pre&s;ent, to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate-Fleet coming away. And all in pur&s;uit of the &s;ame Pacifick Mea&s;ures; that <HI>Spain</HI> &s;eeing how impracti|cable it is for them to carry on that Important Commerce, without a good Under&s;tanding with the more powerful Na|tions of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> may be prevail'd with, if po&s;&s;ible, to continue their Peaceable Di&s;po&s;itions, and pre&s;erve the General Tranquility of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>How far the&s;e Steps, which have been vi&s;ibly taken to pre|vent a War (not to Excite it) have been Succe&s;sful, and how they are re&s;ented by the &s;everal Powers, who&s;e De&s;igns are probably cro&s;s'd and defeated by them; and whether tho&s;e Powers, being convinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Heark|ning to peaceable Propo&s;als, are likely to comply; or whe|ther pretending to be In&s;ulted and Injured by tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, they breathe out Re&s;entment, Revenge and War; this is what lies before us to Enquire.</P>
<P>And here, as I profe&s;s to be &s;peaking as <HI>without Doors</HI> on|ly, I mu&s;t content my &s;elf to ground all the Rea&s;onings and Inferences which I &s;hall make u&s;e of in this Di&s;cour&s;e, from the publick received Reports of Things; at lea&s;t, &s;uch as are Confirmed by repeated Advices, are generally received for Truth, and have not as yet been Contradicted or Di&s;puted; without pretending, or indeed having any Occa&s;ion to pretend, to Secret Intelligence, Private Information, or knowing any thing which &s;hould not be known.</P>
<P>Nor in the Ca&s;e before me is there any Occa&s;ion for en|quiring into Secrets, or looking farther than to what appears. For, to do Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Hanover Allies,</HI> they &s;eem to be a|bove all Di&s;gui&s;es in the Ca&s;e. They are Acting above Board; and the World is left to judge of the Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice of their Proceedings. The Matter is Short, and Open. They de&s;ire Peace; that is evident by the Mea&s;ures they have alrea|dy taken to pre&s;erve it. They are content with every thing &s;tanding upon the ancient Foot. They demand that the &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting Treaties and Conventions be duly Executed; and upon this they In&s;i&s;t. If it be quietly comply'd with, Peace is the Con&s;equence: If not, <HI>Pax Quaeritur Bello.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">
And this is the Rea&s;on, why (as I &s;aid before) this is not the Place for the Impatient People to have their Que&s;tion an|&s;wered. If they ask us here, Whether Peace or War? We An&s;wer, with the Story in the Go&s;pel, The Emperor is of Age, <HI>Ask him:</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> is of Age, <HI>Go and Ask him.</HI> They are to decide the Ca&s;e; for the Offer of Peace is to them. And, as they may accept it if they plea&s;e, they are the only People that can tell whether they will accept it <HI>('till they are Box'd into it)</HI> or no.</P>
<P>Not that this is like to be long the Ca&s;e neither, nor is it rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o; for if they &s;tand out too long; if they reject the Peace, while it is a Peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and &s;uffer or leave Things to come on to Extremities; when once that Peace is broken, and they have pull'd the Hou&s;e down upon their Heads, they mu&s;t get out of the Rubbi&s;h as they can: The Allies are not oblig'd to give them the &s;ame Terms at la&s;t; or to &s;tand always Tendering and Offering the Peace, when they may have been put to Five or Ten Mil|lions <HI>Sterling</HI> Expence, to beat them to it. <HI>But of this in its Place.</HI> I return to the Point in Hand, <HI>viz. The Pre&s;ent Face of Things,</HI> as they appear to be, and as by the uncontrover|ted Accounts from all Parts we believe them to be.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron under Sir <HI>Charles Wager</HI> have been in the <HI>Baltick;</HI> they have pa&s;s'd by <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;hewn them&s;elves to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and, as it may be call'd, have block'd up <HI>Revel</HI> and <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> 'till the Sea&s;on for Action being over, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> can do nothing on that Side.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this Aggre&s;&s;ion, all the mighty De&s;igns of the <HI>Cza|rina,</HI> Empre&s;s of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which (as Fame &s;ays) were very Con&s;iderable, and would have broken the Peace of Chri&s;ten|dom, have been Interrupted and Di&s;appointed. Her embark|ing an Army in Aid of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> to recover his Dominions from the <HI>Danes:</HI> Her &s;ending, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, Selling a Squadron of Men of War to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to &s;trengthen their Naval Power: And her other Namele&s;s De|&s;igns, whatever they were, have been all render'd Abortive. Her Maje&s;ty's Navy, however Formidable, or talk'd up as if they were &s;o, have been Aw'd, kept in Port, and been able to do nothing; no, not &s;o much as to go home again to <HI>Cron&s;lot,</HI> 'till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet thought fit to come away, the Sea&s;on for Action (as above) being over. All this we allow to be true in Fact; and the Con&s;equences have appear|ed as vi&s;ible as the Thing it &s;elf: For, Peace, in all tho&s;e Parts of the World where the War was likely fir&s;t to break
<PB N="23" REF="26">
out, has been Pre&s;erv'd; the <HI>Danes</HI> are &s;ecur'd in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Hanover Treaty;</HI> and the <HI>Swedes</HI> brought off from the other Side, when it was &s;uppos'd they were ju&s;t upon the Point of Engaging in the Treaty of <HI>Vienna;</HI> or in an Alliance with the Emperor, little better than the other.</P>
<P>How the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> will proceed in Con&s;equence of this Tran&s;action; whether the <HI>Czarina,</HI> made &s;en&s;ible how utter|ly uncapable &s;he is to carry on any of her va&s;t De&s;ign, for di|&s;turbing the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> will comply, and come into the Pacifick Offers of the <HI>Hanover Allies:</HI> Or whether her Maje&s;ty, full of Re&s;entment and Anger, at being thus over|powered, will &s;truggle (however vain) to pur&s;ue her fir&s;t De|&s;igns; that remains to be di&s;covered by Time. And there (as I &s;aid) our impatient Enquirers mu&s;t go, with their Que&s;tion about <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War.</HI> Her <HI>Czarian</HI> Maje&s;ty <HI>is of Age, ask Her.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but put one Speculation here into the Hands of our Politicians, upon this Subject of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet, and let them con&s;ider of it. The late <HI>Czar</HI> had rais'd his Naval Power, con&s;idering its Beginning, and the few Years it has been in Being, to a kind of a Prodigy.</P>
<P>A <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet, a Thing the World never heard of be|fore, &s;eemed to appear in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> like a Comet in the wa&s;te or Starry Spaces; or like the new Star in <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopeia</HI>'s Chair, for all the World to wonder at. That &s;uch a Thing was ne|ver heard of before, is mo&s;t certain. The whole <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Empire never were Ma&s;ters of one Ship of War before; no, nor, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t Extent of their Dominions, had the <HI>Czar,</HI> or any of his Ance&s;tors, ever one Ship they could call their own, in any Part of the World, that I have ever heard or read of, except at <HI>Arch-Angel.</HI></P>
<P>It was but in the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Time that the <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf turn'd Ship-Carpenter, and work'd Journey-work for the <HI>States-General.</HI> Having in Di&s;gui&s;e (&s;o Hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us) Enter'd him&s;elf in &s;ome of the Building Yards in that Country; Work'd hard; Earn'd his Pay; and Receiv'd his Wages.</P>
<P>There he bought the fir&s;t Ship he ever had; and now they talk of a Royal Navy, Ships of 80 to 90 Guns; and of bringing out 50 Men of War of the Line. In a Word, nei|ther the <HI>Swede</HI> or <HI>Dane</HI> are able to look them in the Face. Nay, 'tis doubted, whether both together wou'd venture it, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were to &s;tand and look on.</P>
<P>And yet all this while (which is the Thing I mention it for) it is not yet tryed, to this Day, whether, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="24" REF="27">
all their Ships, they dare Fight, or no. Nor do I find, or can learn, that whether Separately, or Together, they ever yet Fir'd one Broad-&s;ide in Earne&s;t, &s;ince they had a Ship.</P>
<P>That they were at fir&s;t well Mann'd, when the Ships were but few, is very certain; and they had Seamen of all Na|tions in their Pay. Their Ships were Commanded by <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and mo&s;t of their Officers were &s;uch al&s;o. But now the Number of their Ships is increas'd, and they have Seamen of their own, &s;uch as they are: But how they will behave, or whether they have either Skill or Cou|rage to Fight, none yet knows. And the World cannot but be a little Curious to know how it would be. It is indeed my Opinion, they would make but very &s;orry Work of it. But 'tis &s;trange, that no Accident &s;hould happen in all this Time, to give them an Occa&s;ion to &s;how, whether they can Fight, or not, and what may be expected of them! Time alone mu&s;t give us the Experiment, and make the Di&s;covery. But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron, under Admiral <HI>Ho&s;ier,</HI> being di&s;patch'd in the very Critical Juncture of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ex|pecting their Galeons, has been &s;ent to the Gulph of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and &s;hewing them&s;elves on the Side of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and near the <HI>Havana,</HI> &s;tood over to the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and to <HI>Porto Belo,</HI> Po&s;ting them&s;elves at the I&s;lands call'd the <HI>Ba|&s;timento's,</HI> a Road which commands the Entrance into <HI>Porto Belo.</HI> Here the Galeons were Unloading, and here they were to take in Twenty-&s;ix Millions of Pieces of Eight in Specie, be&s;ides other Goods: The &s;aid Galeons are &s;till block'd up in that Port, and cannot put to Sea; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Mor|tification and Di&s;appointment of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> who, for want of that Trea&s;ure, are in no Condition in <HI>Old Spain</HI> to carry on their &s;ecret De&s;igns, pay their promis'd Sub&s;idies to the Emperor; and, in &s;hort, kindle the Flame of War in <HI>Europe. May they be &s;till &s;o di&s;abled.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. At the &s;ame Time, a Third Squadron, &s;aid to be inten|ded to the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, has been kept Crui&s;ing and Plying, off and on, upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain;</HI> and is now at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> ready to Intercept (if it comes in their way) the other Plate Fleet, or the other Part of the Plate Fleet; which, coming from <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> with Fifteen Millions of Silver more, is arriv'd at the <HI>Havana.</HI> But having Intelligence (as we &s;uppo&s;e) from <HI>Europe,</HI> have landed that Trea&s;ure there, and laid by the Ships, not thinking fit to venture any farther; By both which Incidents, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are depriv'd of the Return of Forty Millions of Pieces of Eight in Bullion, and
<PB N="25" REF="28">
about Five or Six Millions in Merchandi&s;e. And thus &s;tand Affairs on the Side of the <HI>Hanover Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now look a little on the other Side. And how does the <HI>Vienna Treaty</HI> or Party proceed? How do they take all the&s;e Di&s;appointments? And what are they like to do, as to Peace or War, upon the Re&s;entment?</P>
<P>In their Endeavours to &s;trengthen them&s;elves, by other and farther Alliances, they have not been Idle, that mu&s;t be granted; they have not been wanting to them&s;elves. If we may believe what their own People acknowledge, they have left no Stone unturn'd to draw off, if po&s;&s;ible, the Court of <HI>France</HI> from the <HI>Hanover Treaty;</HI> and to prevent the King of <HI>Sardinia</HI> joyning in with it; but have mi&s;carry'd in both. The Fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;eems to be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Di&s;appointment of all the re&s;t; and which abundantly &s;hows, how Impracticable it is, to bring the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and the Empire, or of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to Unite together. No, notwith&s;tanding a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> enjoys the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> uninterrupted, and in full Peace. <HI>But that by the way.</HI></P>
<P>This Attempt, as it was of the utmo&s;t Importance to the Imperial Court, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e I may obtain your Belief, when I &s;ay the Popi&s;h Clergy have not been wanting to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Intere&s;t at the Court of <HI>France</HI> in favour of it; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Councils of <HI>France</HI> to favour the Happy Juncture (as they call it) of bringing about a Reli|gious War; and for bringing the two Treaties of <HI>Hanover</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> to be entirely a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Alliance, and a <HI>Po|pi&s;h;</HI> that &s;o the Article of Religion might have been brought in, as the chief Matter to be Fought for.</P>
<P>But they have not been able to do it, tho' a Church-man fits at the Head of Affairs in <HI>France,</HI> and a Cardinal is their Prime Mini&s;ter.

<P>That the King of <HI>Sardinia</HI> is as good as lo&s;t to them al&s;o, appears by the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> Arming in the <HI>Milane&s;e;</HI> Fortifying <HI>Novara;</HI> and ordering 20000 Men to be drawn together up|on the fir&s;t Notice; which (as they write from thence) will advance, as &s;oon as they have a certain Account of the King's having Signed the Treaty of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>It might have been of U&s;e here, to take Notice, How much it would be to the Advantage of the <HI>Vienna Alliance,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="29">
if they had been able to have drawn off the King of <HI>Sardinia.</HI> But this is a Subject too tedious for this Tract. I hear, how|ever, that the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> exclaim loudly at the great Ingratitude (as they call it) of that King, who, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> owes his Crown and particularly the Deliverance of his Capital City of <HI>Turin,</HI> to the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts;</HI> that The&s;e travers'd the whole Breadth of <HI>Italy,</HI> in that Glorious March of the Imperial Army, to rai&s;e the Siege; and gave the <HI>French</HI> the greate&s;t Overthrow they ever receiv'd in all the War, except <HI>Blen|heim</HI> only; and all to &s;ave Him from Imminent De&s;truction, which had been otherwi&s;e Unavoidable.

<P>Nor &s;hall I enter here into the Mea&s;ures taken by the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to bring off (if po&s;&s;ible) a certain Power|ful <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Prince, from the Alliance of <HI>Hanover;</HI> in which, 'tis nois'd, that they have had at lea&s;t &s;ome Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s.

<P>That the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> have engaged the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Cologn,</HI> and the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> and are not in doubt of <HI>Saxony,</HI> may, for ought we yet &s;ee, be true: And the Al|liance of tho&s;e Princes (e&s;pecially of Two of them) are not Incon&s;iderable. But 'tis as certain, that the Motions even of the be&s;t of tho&s;e Princes (if not of all the re&s;t) depend &s;o much upon <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Money, which &s;eems at pre&s;ent very remote, that the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e Things &s;eems very Doubtful upon that Account. And even the Emperor, however Powerful, may find it difficult to Act in a vigorous Manner, for want of tho&s;e Sinews of War, which they expected from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Were all the&s;e Things duly Weigh'd, and fairly and im|partially Judg'd of, common Rea&s;oning would &s;eem to tell us, there could be <HI>no War</HI> in View; that the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Councils could not be &s;o Weak, &s;o Infatuated, and &s;o Blind to their true Intere&s;t, as to run them&s;elves into a War, &s;o &s;urrounded with Difficulties; and again&s;t Enemies &s;o perfecty well Furni&s;h'd with every Thing that the&s;e want; &s;o full of what they are &s;o empty of; and &s;o ready for Action, tho' &s;o willing to have Peace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Adver&s;e Powers falling upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Com|merce. That Invading our Trade, is Invading our Property; breaking the Peace: And &s;o the War may be properly &s;aid to be begun. A Word or two, how Weak, and Fooli&s;h, the Attempts this way are; and how ea&s;y it is to Di&s;appoint them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Politicks of the Powers mentioned above, in Form|ing their Intere&s;ts and Alliances, have been mention'd; and, in that Part, they may be &s;aid to Act with &s;ome Coun|cil. If they had acted with the &s;ame Prudence, in &s;ome other Parts of their Mea&s;ures, I am of Opinion we &s;hould indeed have had no Quarrel at all; that is to &s;ay, they would have given the Allies no Occa&s;ion of a War; no, notwith&s;tand|ing their New <HI>Vienna Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>But that which more particularly calls for our Attention, in the Conduct of the&s;e Powers, is their falling upon Trade, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce in particular. And this, tho' they
<PB N="28" REF="31">
are able to do but little in it, to any Purpo&s;e, or at lea&s;t have done but little in it yet; I &s;ay, this &s;hows the reigning Di&s;|po&s;ition among them, to in&s;ult, injure, and affront his Maje&s;ty, and his Allies, and wound their Intere&s;t in every Place where it is Valuable; &s;o (if po&s;&s;ible) to retaliate what they call our Interrupting their Commerce at <HI>Porto Belo.</HI></P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecution of this weak Project (which &s;eems, indeed, as fooli&s;h as it is forward) they have mutually made &s;ome little E&s;&s;ays. I &s;hall mention the Facts fir&s;t, and then the Views of the Contrivers; their Expectations from them, and the Meaning of them, &s;o far as they may be allowed to have any Meaning; which I think indeed will appear very Empty and Weak, and unlikely to Succeed, or an&s;wer their End.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step was made by the Emperor, in Prohibiting the Sale of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures at the Fair of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> As to the generous Part of this Piece of Management, it had, indeed, &s;omething very Extraordinary in it; particularly that the Emperor, that very Emperor, for who&s;e Service and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance his Maje&s;ty &s;ent an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron, to drive away the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to keep the Sea clear, for his recovering the &s;ame City of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and that whole I&s;land; which <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squa|dron continuing in that Part of the World &s;o long, and at &s;o great an Expence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trea&s;ure, made way for the Conque&s;t of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and without which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would never have been Beaten out of it. I &s;ay, that the &s;ame Emperor &s;hould be the fir&s;t of all the Princes of <HI>Sicily,</HI> that &s;hould prohibit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce there, and fall upon the Trade and Intere&s;t of his Benefactors!</P>
<P>Nor could there be any Pretence of the Subjects Benefit, in this Prohibition. No <HI>Sicilian</HI> or <HI>Italian</HI> Manufacture had been &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> or which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could be &s;aid to be Injurious to. Nor was any &s;uch Rea&s;on given, or pretended to be given, for it, that I have yet met with; or any Other; only, That &s;uch was his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the contrary, even the Subjects them&s;elves Remon&s;tra|ted again&s;t it (as I have been Informed) as prejudicial to their own Commerce.</P>
<P>The farther Prohibition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures in the Imperial Hereditary Countries, and Proclaimed by Sound of Trumpet at <HI>Lintz</HI> and <HI>Vienna,</HI> tho' it has the &s;pecious Pre|tence of being done in Favour of their own Manufactures, and at the Reque&s;t of a Company E&s;tabli&s;hed by the Emperor, for carrying on the Woollen Manufacture there; yet it mani|fe&s;tly
<PB N="29" REF="32">
pointed at the Commerce of <HI>England</HI> in general; &s;eve|ral Manufactures being mentioned in the &s;ame Prohibition, which their own Company do not pretend to make, or to make any other that can &s;erve in their &s;tead; as appears by the Remon&s;trances of the Merchants and Trade&s;men of the neighbouring Provinces in his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Domi|nion, made publick with the other.</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e things, which, as I &s;aid, are as weak and impotent as they appear to be piquant, and as I might &s;ay, malicious; we come next to the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Grant of a Trade to the Emperor's Subjects to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> a Trade which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have, 'till now, been &s;o jealous of, that they have with great Strictne&s;s excluded all other Nations from it: But now as an Introduction to this Trade, they have &s;et up an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> who have already carried on a Trade to <HI>India,</HI> and even to <HI>China,</HI> to the manife&s;t Preju|dice of the Allies; and this in a Country conquered for the Em|peror by the Arms of tho&s;e very Nations which are now in|jured by it: and which Trade is expre&s;ly contrary to and incon|&s;i&s;tent with all the Treaties and Conventions upon the foot of which the Emperor enjoys the Dominion of tho&s;e Coun|tries, and of the very Port of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Will any Man ask, after this, whether the&s;e Powers acting thus, intend a War? Invading our Commerce, is invading our Property; e&s;pecially where the exclu&s;ive Right to that Commerce is expre&s;ly &s;tipulated; and invading a Nation's Property is a War begun. As Treaties of Peace commence an Amity and Accord between Nations who were before at War, &s;o avowed Breaches of tho&s;e Treaties put an end to that Amity, and, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> commence a War.</P>
<P>It is true, in mo&s;t Treaties of Peace, and where a conti|nued Amity is de&s;igned, there is u&s;ually a Clau&s;e mentioning, that if any ca&s;ual Contravention of tho&s;e Articles &s;hall happen on either &s;ide, on Complaint made, Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides &s;hall meet to &s;ettle and adju&s;t the Grievances, and Sa|tisfaction &s;hall be made; &s;o that &s;uch Contravention &s;hall not be deemed as a Breach of the Peace, or any Repri&s;als be u&s;ed, unle&s;s the &s;aid Satisfaction be fir&s;t deny'd.</P>
<P>But have not frequent Repre&s;entations, Memorials, and Complaints been made at the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> again&s;t this open Infraction of a Treaty, without being able to obtain any Redre&s;s? but on the contrary, &s;everal haughty Expre&s;&s;ions been heard of, as if the Emperor was at Li|berty to invade any Part of the Commerce of his Neigh|bours, and to break in upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn. Treaties and
<PB N="30" REF="33">
Conventions, in what Manner and at what Time he plea&s;es; and, as may be &s;aid, take the Bread out of the Mouths not of private Per&s;ons only, but even of Nations and incorporated Societies of Trade, at whatever Expence and Hazard tho&s;e Societies and Companies have been e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P>This Method &s;eems to leave the Allies no other Remedy but that of Force. Trading Nations are obliged to defend their Commerce. If others pretend to interrupt it, the&s;e think them&s;elves engaged to enquire into tho&s;e Interruptions, and remove them. If the Doors of our Commerce are &s;hut, we mu&s;t open them; if it is done by rigorous U&s;age of our Merchants, new Impo&s;itions or Prohibitions, the Govern|ment always has thought fit to e&s;pou&s;e the Merchants, pre|&s;erve them from injurious Treatment, and to concern them|&s;elves to obtain Right to be done; and have, as we may &s;ay, made the Ca&s;e of their Merchants their own.</P>
<P>We had an Example of this lately, in the pre&s;ent Reign, when an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant at <HI>Lisbon</HI> (betrayed by his Agents and Servants there) was &s;eiz'd upon, and his Goods confi&s;ca|ted, or ordered to be &s;o, for a particular Affair of Exporting Money; and tho' the Offence was indeed, &s;trictly &s;peaking, Capital by their Laws; yet, as many of the Effects of Mer|chants here in <HI>England,</HI> who were innocent of the Fact, were &s;topt among the re&s;t, and the Per&s;on there was a Man of Worth and Con&s;ideration, and of a good Character; and e&s;pecially as it &s;eemed to affect the whole Commerce, His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e, and procure the Enlarge|ment of the Merchant, and the di&s;charging of the Effects: And the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> li&s;ten'd to the powerful Interce&s;|&s;ion of the King, and pa&s;&s;ed over the thing; notwith&s;tanding, as I have &s;aid, it was a real Offence.</P>
<P>Much more in other Ca&s;es, when the whole Commerce is &s;truck at, Trade loaded with new Burthens, new Im|po&s;itions, and Difference made between the Subjects of one Nation and the Subjects of another: The Governments who&s;e Subjects are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in tho&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions, have al|ways thought them&s;elves concerned in the Inva&s;ions of their Trade, and have e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;ts of their Merchants, and of the Trade, as a publick Concern.</P>
<P>It is alledged in this Ca&s;e that every Prince or Government has a Right to govern their own Commerce, and make &s;uch Prohibitions, or lay &s;uch Duties and Impo&s;ts upon their Im|portations, as they think fit; becau&s;e &s;uch Prohibitions chiefly regard the U&s;e and Wearing of &s;uch or &s;uch Goods by their own People; and it is always the Right of any Government
<PB N="31" REF="34">
to limit the U&s;ages, Habits, Cu&s;toms and Apparel of their own Subjects.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this is &s;hort and direct. It is &s;o, where no former Stipulations, Treaties and Conventions are made to the contrary; but that Right is limited, and cea&s;es, when the &s;aid Nation, &s;o loading the Commerce of any other Coun|try, have by Treaty oblig'd them&s;elves expre&s;ly not to do it: Then, I &s;ay, and in ca&s;e of &s;uch Treaties, the Ca&s;e alters, and their Hands are tied up, and to do it afterward is an In|fraction of the Treaty, and a Breach of the Friend&s;hip and good Corre&s;pondence e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two Nations.</P>
<P>This was exactly the Ca&s;e in the late Di&s;putes which hap|pen'd here, about opening the Trade to <HI>France.</HI> It was urged, that it could not be; that <HI>England</HI> could not take off the high Duties upon the Importation of Wines (in particular) from <HI>France,</HI> unle&s;s a Proportion of the Duties upon the Wines of <HI>Portugal</HI> were al&s;o taken off; &s;o as that the Duty up|on the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines &s;hould be &s;till &s;o much le&s;s than the Duties on the Wines of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this was, becau&s;e <HI>England</HI> was under Ex|pre&s;s Conditions to the contrary in the Treaty of Peace and Commerce then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the Articles of the &s;aid Treaty of <HI>Portugal</HI> were produced, wherein it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated as above, that the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Wine &s;hould always be &s;o and &s;o limited; and this being found to be true in fact, was admitted as a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why the Commerce of <HI>France</HI> could not be opened as was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>All Breaches of Treaties are Breaches of Friend&s;hip, whe|ther they relate to the Peace or Commerce of the Nations; and the Breach of Friend&s;hip between Nations is a kind of declaring War in many Re&s;pects; and nothing but meer Force and Inva&s;ion can be a more manife&s;t Breach of Friend|&s;hip, than &s;topping the Intercour&s;e and Corre&s;pondence of the Merchants.</P>
<P>Nor is this one of the lea&s;t, or le&s;s important Articles in mo&s;t Treaties, <HI>viz.</HI> That there &s;hall be a free Intercour&s;e of Trade and Corre&s;pondence between the Subjects of either Nation; as may be &s;een in almo&s;t all the Treaties of Peace which have been made among the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and it will be found &s;o in a particular and extraordinary manner in all the Treaties made and now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and this Particular will be found in tho&s;e Treaties which is modern and &s;ingular, namely, That the Subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hall be u&s;ed in all the Affairs relating to Commerce, upon the &s;ame foot as the Nations which are mo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="35">
favoured. Which Article was in&s;erted in regard to &s;ome Appre|hen&s;ions that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould be more e&s;pecially and parti|cularly favoured in the Affairs of Trade, than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that they &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed with a Partiality &s;ingular, and to the Prejudice of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e this Partiality &s;hould be afterward put in Practice, in ca&s;e this Corre&s;pondence, Intercour&s;e and Commerce be interrupted by the Governour of that Country with whom &s;uch a free Intercour&s;e was &s;tipulated, and Prohibitions of the Trade &s;et up; the Peace is &s;o far broken. Suppo&s;e, for Ex|ample, the Importation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures in <HI>Spain</HI> is forbid, and the U&s;e or Wearing them prohibited, which is the &s;evere&s;t way of interrupting the Commerce; is not this equally a Breach of the good Under&s;tanding and Commerce of the two Nations? Is it not a Breach of the Friend&s;hip and free Intercour&s;e between them? and what is this le&s;s than a kind of declaring War?</P>
<P>It was the Ob&s;ervation of a wi&s;e Man, that the Peace and Friend&s;hip of two trading Nations &s;eldom (nay he &s;aid Ne|ver) continued long, where Commerce remained contraband. 'Tis like two Men pretending to Friend&s;hip, yet never &s;peak|ing to, or &s;aluting, or taking notice of one another upon any Occa&s;ion. How long will that continue? How long will &s;uch Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>Our Intere&s;t is our Trade; and our Trade is, next to our Liberty and Religion, one of our mo&s;t valuable Liberties; if our Neighbours pretend to &s;hut the Door again&s;t our Com|merce, we mu&s;t open it; and that by Force, if no other Means will procure it. To invade our Commerce is to invade our Property, and we may, and mu&s;t defend it; and therefore I &s;ay, to invade our Trade is to begin a War; and will any Man then ask me, whether we &s;hall have <HI>War</HI> or <HI>Peace?</HI></P>
<P>The An&s;wer is Categorical; if they plea&s;e to leave our Commerce free and uninterrupted, as they found it; lay down their interloping Companies, by which they have begun to in|vade it; cea&s;e their Infractions of the &s;olemn Treaties, and leave our Commerce open, then with &s;ome other Conce&s;|&s;ions all will be well, and I believe we &s;hall have no <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, Do all tho&s;e things go on, &s;hall they &s;upport their interloping <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Company; forbid their Sub|jects wearing and u&s;ing our Manufacture; and interrupt our Commerce? As <HI>Jehu</HI> &s;aid to the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> when he met him, and asked, <HI>Is it Peace, Jehu?</HI> he replied, <HI>What Peace, while the Whoredoms of thy Mother Jezabel and her Witch|crafts are &s;o many?</HI> So I &s;ay, What Peace, when the En|croachments
<PB N="33" REF="36">
on our Trade, the Interruptions and Inva&s;ions of our Commerce are &s;o many? What Peace, while the Leagues and private Confederacies are &s;o many? Leagues that are &s;o apparently de&s;tructive of Peace and good Neigh|bourhood; Leagues that threaten War, and are an open con|&s;olidating of Intere&s;ts in ca&s;e of War; Leagues that &s;upport Po|pery and Per&s;ecution, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and murthering Prote&s;tant Subjects under Guarantee of Prote&s;tant Powers and Princes: Leagues that are in their own Nature tacit Declarations of a warlike Intention. What Peace can there be, while this is the Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>We have &s;een frequent Examples upon many, nay almo&s;t upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that when any Princes rai&s;e Forts or fortify Towns upon their Frontiers, or re-fortify Towns which have been demoli&s;hed by Treaties and Confederacies; that &s;uch fortifying of Frontiers is taken for an Intimation of War, or at lea&s;t for a Te&s;timony of unpeaceable and dange|rous De&s;igns; and the neighbouring Princes generally take Umbrage at &s;uch things; &s;end Agents and Me&s;&s;ages to en|quire into the Rea&s;on of them; declare their Di&s;&s;atisfaction, and threaten to u&s;e Force to put a &s;top to tho&s;e Prepara|tions, Fortifications, and repairing of demoli&s;hed Places.</P>
<P>If the Princes and Powers by whom tho&s;e Fortifications are made, do not give a peaceable and &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, a&s;&s;ign proper Rea&s;ons for what they do, and give A&s;&s;urances that they have no De&s;ign injurious to their Neighbours the Complainers, they frequently draw together their Forces, and appear re&s;olved to oblige them by their Power, to give over or demoli&s;h again the Works they had begun.</P>
<P>Examples of this are many, and recent in Memory; as the Fortifications which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> rai&s;ed at <HI>Hu&s;um,</HI> at <HI>Heu&s;den,</HI> and other Places on the Frontiers of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> which cau&s;ed the <HI>Swedes</HI> and Princes of <HI>Lunenburgh</HI> to arm again&s;t him, after in vain having de&s;ired his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty to cea&s;e his Works and leave the Country open; and this cau&s;ed an Army of tho&s;e Powers to a&s;&s;emble and march to the Frontiers, in order to effect it by Force, no other Me|thod proving effectual; upon which en&s;ued the Treaty of <HI>Trav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">al,</HI> where the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> yielded, and the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> immediately demoli&s;hed.</P>

<P><PB N="34" REF="37">
It was certainly ju&s;t (and no Nation had any thing to do with it) that the <HI>French</HI> might, and ought to be at Liberty to build Piers and make Harbours, Docks and other things for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Commerce and Navigation in any Part of their Dominions, as much as the King of <HI>England</HI> has a Right to do it at <HI>Dover,</HI> or the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Sluys.</HI></P>
<P>But if his Maje&s;ty had &s;tipulated by a &s;olemn Treaty not to do it, I cannot &s;ay it would be equally rightful or ju&s;t to do it then. So the <HI>French</HI> having po&s;itively engaged not to rai&s;e any Fortifications at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or to re&s;tore that Har|bour there, or on any Part of the Coa&s;t near it, as was the Ca&s;e in the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> that Right to do it cea&s;ed, and was anticipated and taken away by the Treaty; for what any Prince or Power have bound them&s;elves not to do, they may be &s;aid to have no Right to do.</P>
<P>There are many Examples of the like kind in &s;everal other Parts of the World, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I might bring this home to the Harbour of <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> I am not &s;en&s;ible that any Treaty or Convention by which the Emperor enjoys that Port, obliges him not to enlarge it, deepen the Channel, make Piers, Ba&s;ins, or any thing el&s;e, as &s;hall appear for his Convenience, and for the Security of his Merchants and of their Ships: I &s;ay I do not know that the Emperor is under any Treaty or Obligation not to do this, and &s;o his ordering the&s;e Enlargements are no Contravention of any &s;uch Treaty, nor any ju&s;t Ground of Quarrel or Jea|lou&s;y; for why &s;hould not his Imperial Maje&s;ty do every ju&s;t thing for the Good of his People, the Encouragement of their Commerce, the Security of their Ships, and the like?</P>
<P>But as the&s;e Works at <HI>O&s;tend</HI> are evidently de&s;ign'd for the receiving and protecting the Ships, encouraging the Trade, and carrying on the new Company's Commerce to the <HI>Indies,</HI> which Trade the Emperor is expre&s;ly bound even in the ve|ry Tenure of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion not to &s;upport or carry on, or to &s;uffer to be carried on; then the Ca&s;e differs exceedingly; and even the fortifying <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> deepening and enlarging the Harbour, and the like, as mentioned above, is a ju&s;t matter of Jealou&s;y; and however lawful in it&s;elf, yet intimates plain|ly, that the Emperor and his Subjects are re&s;olved to continue and carry on that Trade, how prejudicial &s;oever to their Neighbours the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and however it may appear to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Treaties and Obligations which His Imperial Maje&s;ty is bound by, and enjoys the Country by the Stipulation of.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">
It evidently &s;hews a re&s;olved Temper, a fixed De&s;ign and Di&s;po&s;ition to continue that Commerce, however injurious to us their Neighbours; and that (if it cannot be otherwi&s;e obtained) in&s;tead of abating or laying it down, as was expected, and according to the Remon&s;trances of the Allies, they re&s;olve rather to maintain it by Force; and menacing the Ally'd Powers with their formidable Re&s;entments, pre|tend to make War upon tho&s;e that &s;hall interrupt it; as if they were able to Act in the &s;ame Ho&s;tile manner they talk of, and as if their Power was equal to their Blu&s;ter, on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This is what (in our vulgar way) we call <HI>Showing their Teeth;</HI> and could they do no more that way by Land, than they can by Sea, it would merit &s;ome vulgar Talking of it. But as they &s;eem to threaten the World with their mighty Forces, and that tho&s;e Forces are indeed Con&s;idera|ble, at lea&s;t are far from being De&s;picable, this is that which tells me there &s;eems to be a Nece&s;&s;ity of a War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flemings</HI> talk big, and &s;ay, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> (for Exam|ple) date to touch their Ships, and interrupt their Trade, in and to the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Emperor will attack them with all his Forces by Land. That I call War: and that is what I call the Nece&s;&s;ity of a War. For it &s;eems not to be expe|cted, that Marine Trading Nations, &s;uch as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who&s;e Trade to the <HI>Indies</HI> is &s;o con&s;iderable, and which the Emperor is by Treaty bound not to Invade, will &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee it Invaded and In&s;ulted. On the contrary, I think they will not, mu&s;t not, cannot do it.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. cannot, mu&s;t not, and will not, bear this Commerce; and the Emperor will not, cannot lay it down, and give it over; and threatens them, if they offer to interrupt it: What follows? What is the nece&s;|&s;ary Con&s;equence, but a War? Nay, What are the&s;e Things but a War in Effect, if not in all the Circum|&s;tances of it? And where the&s;e things are Acted in this Manner, how can any Man make a Que&s;tion, whether a War will happen, or no?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Whether in Point of Right and Wrong we ought or may conclude, that a War ought to be the Con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent Councils in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is not the mo&s;t difficult Thing in the World, to make a Judgment of what <HI>may be,</HI> by <HI>what is:</HI> The publick Conduct of Princes and States &s;eldom &s;o effectually di&s;gui&s;es their Intentions, but &s;ome Rational Ob&s;ervations may be made; &s;ome Ju&s;t Inferences drawn; and &s;ome Probable Gue&s;&s;es be made, of what will be the I&s;&s;ue of their Councils.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Politicks of <HI>Europe</HI> are indeed more Intricate than ordinary: And yet they are not without evident, vi&s;i|ble Marks of the Intention that &s;everal Princes and Powers have, or had, to Break the Peace of the World, and invade the <HI>Property</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> of their Neighbours, in order to begin a War.</P>
<P>I have already mention'd, that the <HI>Czarina,</HI> or Empre&s;s of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> had form'd a Re&s;olution to begin a War, and put and End to the Tranquility of <HI>Europe,</HI> by an Attempt upon the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in Favour of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein.</HI> I do not &s;ay po&s;itively it is &s;o; but who can make any Doubt of it? To what Purpo&s;e were the Neighbours of that Prin|ce&s;s alarm'd in that Manner? And why was the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron &s;ent into the <HI>Baltick</HI> to prevent tho&s;e Attempts, if there was not &s;uch an apparent De&s;ign? Nor (as I am told) did the Court of <HI>Petersburgh</HI> &s;o much as endeavour to Con|ceal it; but rather &s;ollicited other Powers to A&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Duke, in, what they call'd, Recovering his Inheritance.</P>
<P>Again, who can doubt the Re&s;olutions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court (if po&s;&s;ible) to Pre&s;erve the Peace; keep every one in the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they held; and tye up every Side to tho&s;e Terms of Peace which they had already Con&s;ented to; when they &s;aw the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet block up the Aggre&s;&s;ors in their Ports, and put an End to all the violent Mea&s;ures re|&s;olv'd on? (A Te&s;timony al&s;o, that &s;uch Mea&s;ures were re|&s;olv'd on.)</P>
<P>As to the Ju&s;tice of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>'s Claim to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Antient Dominions, I have nothing to do with that here: Be it Ju&s;t, or Unju&s;t, that they were taken from him; and be it Right, or Wrong, that they are kept
<PB N="37" REF="40">
from him, that is not the Que&s;tion to us. But as the <HI>Czarina</HI> Aiding the Duke with a Powerful Army, as was intended, for the Recovery of tho&s;e Dominions, would nece&s;&s;arily have begun a War, and perhaps embarked &s;everal Princes on both Sides, in the Quarrel; &s;o far the Pacifick Powers were ju&s;tly engag'd to prevent it; and probably may exert them|&s;elves in the &s;ame, or like manner, to do the like for the fu|ture; and that, not only there, but any where el&s;e where they find the like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould be always at the Yearly Ex|pence of &s;uch a Fleet, to keep the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet within Bounds, and to pre&s;erve the Peace of the <HI>Baltick:</HI> But it is to be &s;uppos'd, that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Powers being United, they may at length join their Fleets, and be in a Condition to match the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet, and Command the Sea &s;o, as to keep them up within their Ports, without the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>From thence let us con&s;ider the Preparations of the Impe|riali&s;ts. Why &s;hould I not &s;ay, that it is very probable they intend a War, when we have the following Account publi&s;h|ed in one of our publick Papers, &s;aid to be come from the Council of the <HI>States General?</HI></P>

<P>Some Days ago, the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were invited to a Solemn Conference with the <HI>States General;</HI> where their High Mightine&s;s's Deputies opened the Di&s;cour&s;e with a Recapitulation of all the Re&s;olutions taken by the States, &s;ince their Acce&s;&s;ion to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover,</HI> that regarded the Military Preparations; to which they added, That &s;ince there remained little or no Likely|hood that the Differences between the Contending Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> could be amicably Adju&s;ted during the Winter, the <HI>States</HI> had all the Rea&s;on in the World to fear that the Emperor would, in Revenge for &s;uch their Acce&s;&s;ion, be|gin Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Republick; either by Attacking it with open Force, or by &s;topping the Payment of the Sub&s;i|dies, &s;tipulated by the Barrier Treaty.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Rea&s;on of my quoting this Speech of the <HI>States</HI> De|puties, is very plain, as the Speech it &s;elf is very convincing in the Ca&s;e before us. If the <HI>States</HI> have all the Rea&s;on in the World to fear that the Emperor will begin Ho&s;tilities with them, for their Acceding to the <HI>Hanover Treaty;</HI> then we have the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that is to &s;ay, all the Rea&s;on in the World, to believe a War will follow. So that there you
<PB N="38" REF="41">
have the An&s;wer of the <HI>States General</HI> directly to this great Que&s;tion about the War.</P>
<P>Here is another Thing al&s;o advanc'd in that &s;hort Speech of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies, which affords us &s;ome Foundation for the Arguments already u&s;ed; where I &s;eem to in&s;i&s;t That the <HI>War</HI> is as it were already re&s;olv'd on, if not begun, by the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by their interrupting and inva|ding our Commerce. The Deputies &s;ay,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They have all the Rea&s;on in the World to fear that the Emperor will begin Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Republick, either by Attacking it with open Force, or by &s;topping the Sub&s;i|dies &s;tipulated by the Barrier Treaty.</Q></P>
<P>Where, <HI>Stopping the Payment</HI> of &s;tipulated Sub&s;idies to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, is call'd a Beginning of Ho&s;tilities. And is not then &s;topping the Cour&s;e of &s;tipulated Commerce, a Be|ginning of Ho&s;tilities? I cannot refrain &s;aying, I think it is: And, <HI>if &s;o,</HI> then I think the Ho&s;tilities are begun, as much as if the Armies were in the Field, or the Fleets engag'd.</P>
<P>But now, as to the Que&s;tion, as it &s;tands in Point of RIGHT; that indeed differs exceedingly: for 'tis one Thing to ask me, Whether <HI>I believe</HI> the Emperor WILL begin a War, and another Thing, Whether HE OUGHT to do &s;o, or has a ju&s;t Cau&s;e to do it, <HI>or no.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Que&s;tion, Whether the Emperor <HI>ought</HI> to begin a War? I have two Rea&s;ons to give, why I think not; why I think the Emperor ought not to make a War, as well in general, as not in particular, in this Ca&s;e.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e, <HI>in general,</HI> no War ought to be made among Chri&s;tians, but upon ju&s;t and unavoidable Occa&s;ion. Had this War been entred upon, only in Support of a Commerce &s;et up upon unju&s;t Foundations, again&s;t expre&s;s Stipulations, and again&s;t the Tenor of Conditions on which the very Coun|try came to the Emperor, in which he carries it on; he ra|ther might be &s;aid to forfeit by this Encroachment the Right he had, than have a new Right to pu&s;h on Separate Intere&s;ts, in Prejudice of others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e, <HI>in particular,</HI> he is under Special and Per&s;onal Obligations to the very Nations who are injured by this Com|merce; and that &s;uch, as that to them he owes the very Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and Dominions which he enjoys, as well in that, as in &s;everal other Parts of the World. The <HI>Netherlands</HI> may be &s;aid to be their Gift to him; they were gain'd at their Co&s;t, at the Expence of their Blood and Trea&s;ure. And tho' it might be call'd his Right, yet ('tis very probable) he had ne|ver had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Right, if they had not Power|fully
<PB N="39" REF="42">
&s;upported his Claim, conquer'd the Country by their Armies, put it into his Hand; and obtained the Conce&s;|&s;ion of <HI>France</HI> to it, by the Treaty of Peace concluded at <HI>Utrecht.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>GRATITUDE binds Princes as well as private Men; Nations, as well as particular Per&s;ons: And &s;uch good Offi|ces as the&s;e, can never be too much acknowledg'd, or too well requited. To &s;ay Kings and Emperors are not bound by &s;uch Obligations, is to &s;ay Kings and Emperors are not or can not be Good Men, or Hone&s;t Men.</P>
<P>GRATITUDE is a Branch of <HI>Hone&s;ty;</HI> and it is very hard to &s;ay, or even to think, a Man can be Hone&s;t that is not Grateful; for as <HI>Gratitude</HI> re&s;pects an Obligation pa&s;t, or a Kindne&s;s receiv'd; &s;o it is no more or le&s;s, than paying a Debt; and tho' the Debt be not &s;uch perhaps as can be de|manded by Proce&s;s (if it were, the Creditor could oblige the Debtor to Payment) yet the Obligation is the &s;tronger. The Man of Honour always thinks him&s;elf bound fa&s;ter by the generous Kindne&s;s of his Friend, than by his own Bond, and will more punctually pay a Debt of Honour, than a Debt of Law.</P>
<P>To &s;ay a Prince is above all Acknowledgment, and all Re|turns of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> is to &s;ay a Prince is not bound by Princi|ples of <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can Rea&s;ons of State ballance this Principle of Honour, or the Sen&s;e of Obligation in a Prince. The late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and indeed the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, left a remarkable Te&s;ti|mony of their publick Regard to this Principle of Honour upon Record, even in a National Capacity, which I cannot but mention.</P>
<P>After the Re&s;toration, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament thought it convenient, for the Publick Good, to make &s;everal &s;trict Laws again&s;t Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants; and e&s;pecially again&s;t Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts, who were (on the &s;evere&s;t Penalties) forbid re&s;iding here, and particularly officiating as Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet not the King only, but the Parliament it &s;elf, in all their Acts, made an Exception for Father <HI>Huddle&s;ton</HI> a Prie&s;t, nay, a <HI>Je&s;uit;</HI> in perpetual Remembrance of and <HI>Gratitude</HI> for his Fidelity to the Per&s;on of the King, in concealing his Maje&s;ty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to his E&s;cape, even at the Hazard of his own Life, and in Contempt of the Reward of 1000<HI>l.</HI> offered by the Enemy for the Di&s;covery, after the Defeat of the Royal Army at <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a Te&s;timony of a Nation's <HI>Gratitude,</HI> and of a Prince's <HI>Gratitude,</HI> and that even when the &s;aid Nation was under
<PB N="40" REF="43">
the mo&s;t powerful and ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of the pernicions Pra|ctices of tho&s;e very Prie&s;ts, for the perverting both Prince and People to Popery; and when that Prince, as it was &s;aid at la&s;t, was influenced &s;o far as to be &s;ecretly reconcil'd,&mdash;<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But GRATITUDE never dyes, and Obligation never cea&s;es; nothing can wear it out of the Mind, where the Mind is once po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Principles of Honour, of Religion, and of Ju&s;tice: A Man of Honour can no more be Ingrate, than a Man of Hone&s;ty can Steal. Ingratitude is hardly to be expre&s;s'd by any Word wor&s;e than it &s;elf; and therefore 'twas the Saying of a great Man, <HI>That to &s;ay a Man is Ingrate, is to &s;ay All of him that is Evil:</HI> Ingratitude being a Compli|cation of almo&s;t all Crimes. 'Tis a cancelling all Obliga|tions in the Mind; and harbouring Mi&s;chief and Re&s;entment, in&s;tead of Affection and a Sen&s;e of Obligation.</P>
<P>I have heard from &s;ome of our Moralizing, Criticizing Friends, who are fam'd for &s;earching too nicely into Nature's <HI>Arcana,</HI> that it is an Evil rooted in Mankind, to have an A|ver&s;ion, in&s;tead of Affection, where they are over-loaded with Obilgation. That Man, thro' a certain &s;ecret Pride natu|ral to him, and introduced by the fir&s;t Seeds of Degeneracy, con&s;tantly hates to be Obliged beyond his Power to make Returns.</P>
<P>That as long as he can balance Accounts, and while he is upon the Square, he will be an entire Friend, and act as &s;uch upon every Occa&s;ion; nay, he will be plea&s;ed with the Oc|ca&s;ion of over-paying the Debt: But when he &s;ees a Weight of Obligation flowing in too heavy for him to throw off, that the Debt is too great to be paid, and that he can never hope to balance the Account, he grows &s;ick of the Obligation; and con&s;equently throwing off all thoughts of Return, Hatred comes in of Cour&s;e; for the Man hates to &s;ee the Per&s;on to whom he mu&s;t be always making Acknowledg|ments.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay how far I am or am not of this Opinion, in this Ca&s;e; but I mu&s;t own, that I can find out no other Way, (or at lea&s;t no better Way) to account for the Conduct of a certain Prince in the World; I mean as to Obligations laid upon him Per&s;onally, as well as in his Publick Capacity, by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>I remember a &s;mall Book, or Pamphlet, publi&s;hed in the Year 1712, Entituled, IMPERIAL GRATITUDE, drawn from a mode&s;t View of the Conduct of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> VI. and the King of <HI>Spain Charles</HI> III. with Ob&s;ervations on the Difference.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">

The&s;e things, &s;ays the Author, would hardly &s;eem credi|table, were not the Vouchers ready to confirm the Particulars, and to prove every Part of them; and he adds, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That after &s;uch an immen&s;e Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure laid out in his Service, it would have been very Grateful and Ho|nourable, and perhaps but Rea&s;onable, that His Maje&s;ty &s;hould have written one Letter more, to a&s;&s;ure Her Maje|&s;ty, He will think now of &s;ome Means to pay, or &s;ecure the Payment of, tho&s;e immen&s;e Sums which the Queen had laid out to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Book gives a particular Account of his Maje&s;ty's being be&s;ieged in the City of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and of the Di&s;tre&s;s he was reduced to; gives Copies of the pre&s;&s;ing Letters which the King wrote to Her Maje&s;ty for Succours, and the Account of the timely Deliverance obtained by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet and Troops in rai&s;ing the Siege, and cau&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> Army to retire with Di&s;grace; which adds to the Ac|count, and heightens the Obligation that his Maje&s;ty acknow|ledged him&s;elf to be under before.</P>
<P>After this, the Death of the Emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> happen'd; and then all the Confederates, but <HI>England</HI> in particular, made the mo&s;t powerful In&s;tances among the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to procure the Election of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and carried it for his Maje&s;ty again&s;t all the Intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> Court, and the particular Application of the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Co|logn.</HI></P>
<P>This fini&s;hed the Fortunes of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and advanced him to the highe&s;t Degree of Human Glory that this World can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Let us cea&s;e here a little 'till the Acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty to the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and be&s;ides all the Obligations laid on his Imperial Maje&s;ty of another kind, of which I have no room to enlarge in this Place, we may at once look into the Quadruple Alliance; a Treaty which, by the Intere&s;t and Influence of his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty, was cal|culated for the particular Service of the Emperor; the King of <HI>France</HI> was brought to a&s;&s;i&s;t by his Arms to bring the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to hearken to Rea&s;on, and to come to the Terms of the Truce, and <HI>Spain</HI> pre&s;&s;ed by the Arms of <HI>France</HI> did con&s;ent to put an end to the War.</P>
<P>Without the powerful Fleet of the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> opening the Sea to the Imperiali&s;ts, and &s;hutting it up from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> defeating and taking their whole Fleet, the Imperiali&s;ts had never been able to have taken the King|dom of <HI>Sicily:</HI> So that it is to the glorious Arms of His Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="46" REF="49">
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were driven out of that Kingdom, and the Emperor put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Now bring all this down to the pre&s;ent State of Things, May we not civilly examine for which of all the&s;e Acts of generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, I &s;ay for which of them it is that the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> or the Emperor, has prohibited the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce at the Fair of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> the very City King <HI>George</HI> may be &s;aid to have conquered for him; for which of them he has invaded our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, and prohibited all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures in the great Market of <HI>Lintz</HI> by Sound of Trumpet?</P>
<P>May we not &s;ay, Is this <HI>Imperial Gratitude?</HI> Is this a &s;uitable Return to His Maje&s;ty, and to the powerful Efforts of a Ge|nerous Nation, for the Intere&s;t and Honour of the Emperor? Is it what His Maje&s;ty might rea&s;onably expect, or what the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation had Rea&s;on to look for? Or is this the Way the Princes of that Part of the World pay their Debts of Honour, and balance the great Obligations which they receive from one another? We hope we might &s;ay this without Offence.</P>
<P>Let the Language of His late Imperial Maje&s;ty's Letters to the late Queen, to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> at the naming his Grand&s;on to the Succe&s;&s;i|on of <HI>Spain,</HI> and after the Battel of <HI>Blenheim;</HI> and the Lan|guage of His pre&s;ent Imperial Maje&s;ty when &s;hut up in <HI>Barce|lona,</HI> and in Danger of being carried in Triumph to <HI>Madrid,</HI> be all con&s;idered, when he was every Hour expecting a gene|ral A&s;&s;ault, and begged of Sir <HI>George Rook</HI> to come &s;peedily to his Relief:</P>
<P>I &s;ay, let the&s;e which are at hand to produce, and which, had I room, I could give you at large, to illu&s;trate this Part, be con&s;idered; May we not compare them with the Terms now u&s;ed in Return to the frequent Memorials and Repre&s;en|tations of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Madrid,</HI> claiming a ju&s;t and friendly Performance, not of Promi&s;es only and grateful Remembrances of generous and kind Actions done, but of &s;olemn Treaties and Leagues; Treaties of Peace and Commerce, Friend&s;hip and good Under&s;tanding, wherein Limits of Trade as well as Dominion are &s;ettled and adju&s;ted? Let the haughty An&s;wers and the Expo&s;tulations of Re&s;entment, which Fame &s;ays were returned by the Court of <HI>V&mdash;</HI> to Memorials framed with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect, be all Duly con&s;idered and compared as above, and what &s;hall we conclude from it; what can we &s;ay! except that perhaps this is the Meaning of that hitherto Mi&s;under&s;tood Expre&s;&s;ion, that difficult and doubtful Thing called IMPERIAL GRATI|TUDE.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50">
From all which however, we may flatter our &s;elves, that for the future, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation and their generous Prin|ces, will con&s;ider very well how they oblige Emperors again, beyond their Power of Requital; and how they &s;pend Eight Millions to &s;et a Prince upon a Throne, that &s;hall turn the Arms of that very Power they gave him again&s;t the Intere&s;t of his Benefactors.</P>
<P>But Heaven, who&s;e Impartial Ju&s;tice the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation and their injur'd Sovereign appeal to in all this, will no doubt &s;oon di&s;cover its Sentiments of the&s;e things; and the Power God has put into his Maje&s;ty's Hands can never be better employed, than to humble the In&s;olence of &s;uch Powers, as think them&s;elves above the Natural Laws of Friend&s;hip and Gratitude, and regard no Ju&s;tice, but as it conforms with their Intere&s;t, and encrea&s;es their Power.</P>

<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being Aggre&s;&s;ors in the War; their Pretences, how tri&s;ling; their Power, how far from being formidable; and of what the Con&s;equences of a War may be, as well to them as to us.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF we may judge by the Appearance of Things, there are two Articles in this Forwardne&s;s of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to Quarrel, which make it very prepo&s;terous on their Side.<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That they are as ill able to manage a Quarrel (with <HI>England</HI> e&s;pecially) as any Nation in <HI>Europe.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> They have as little Pretence to make a Quarrel of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to their Ability to manage a War with us, I have &s;poken of it in particular already; and le&s;t I &s;hould be told, 'tis time enough to boa&s;t <HI>when we put our Armour off,</HI> I am content to &s;tay 'till then; and let the <HI>Spaniards</HI> count their Gain when they have had their Fill of a War, &s;o I &s;ay no more of that now.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their Pretences, or the Cau&s;es of Quarrel, I can find but two; that is to &s;ay, all that I can meet with on their own Part, or that they &s;o much as pretend to, may be reduced to two Heads.<LIST>
<PB N="48" REF="51">
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Affair of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron lying before <HI>Por|to Belo;</HI> or, as they commonly expre&s;s it, Blocking up their Ports, and in it their Plate-Fleet.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> refu&s;ing to re&s;tore <HI>Port-Mahon</HI> and <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As for the Fir&s;t, they make a great Noi&s;e of it; complain of its being an In&s;ulting their Coa&s;t, an open Violation of Friend|&s;hip, an Interruption of Commerce, and an Act of Ho&s;tility, with much more of that Kind; and upon this we are now told they draw together their Armies, Hover about <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> (tho' they are able to do very little to it) talk of Building new Fortifications to incommode the Bay or Port, buy Ships of War, and, in a word, &s;how by many weak Advances that they re&s;olve upon a War.</P>
<P>Certainly the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have very wrong Notions of their own Strength, or el&s;e we are ill inform'd about it; and par|ticularly how ill able they are with all their Strength, tho' it were double to what it is, to annoy the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or defend them|&s;elves again&s;t us.</P>
<P>That they are not equal by Sea is very evident; 'tis no Boa&s;ting to &s;ay they cannot look us in the Face upon the Salt-water; all the Naval Force of <HI>Spain,</HI> were it brought together, and had they the greate&s;t Liberty given them they could de&s;ire to bring it together, could not fight a Squadron of twenty <HI>Briti&s;h Third Rates;</HI> and this I &s;ay is far from being a Blu&s;ter, &s;ince it was proved at Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;aro,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had the be&s;t Fleet, and the bigge&s;t Ships that they have ever &s;een at Sea <HI>of their Own</HI> for a hundred Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>What then are the <HI>Spaniards</HI> doing? Do they reflect that <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> the three great|e&s;t Marine Powers in the World, are in Alliance, and may come to act in Conjunction in this War, if there was any Oc|ca&s;ion for it, again&s;t one (alas how Impotent!) fingle Power of <HI>Spain?</HI> Have they con&s;idered what they are able to do again&s;t Three &s;uch Powers United, the weake&s;t of whom are able to blow all the Ships of <HI>Spain</HI> out of the Sea, and make them not dare to &s;tir out of their Ports? What can the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI> think of &s;uch an unequal War? and what Encouragement can their Officers and Seamen have to engage in their Service, or embark in their Ships, where they are &s;o &s;ure to be beaten?</P>
<P N="2">2. Have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> con&s;ider'd, that they have a va&s;t un|guarded Coa&s;t for above a thou&s;and Miles lying upon the Sea, as well on the Side of the Ocean, as in the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> from St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> at the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> to
<PB N="49" REF="52">
<HI>Viana</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Galitia,</HI> and from the River <HI>Guadiana</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Straits,</HI> and thence to the Bay of <HI>Ro&s;es,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Rou&s;illon,</HI> in the Dominion of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Length of this Coa&s;t is at lea&s;t twelve hundred Miles: Not all the Force of <HI>Spain,</HI> nay, &s;carce all the Men in <HI>Spain,</HI> were they arm'd and form'd into Regiments, could guard &s;uch an extended Coa&s;t, &s;o as that they could prevent its being con|tinually harra&s;s'd and in&s;ulted by an Enemy that is thus &s;upe|rior at Sea; and who can appear now on this &s;ide, now on that, and who&s;e Motions it is impo&s;&s;ible any Troops on Shore can follow or ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>What &s;trange Havock could the Allies, thus arm'd, and Su|perior at Sea, make upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain?</HI> and whether they ever landed or no, their very hovering upon the Coa&s;t is Alarm enough to keep the whole Country waking, and hur|ry and fatigue their Soldiers to Death, by ha&s;ty Marches in a hot Climate; &s;o that the Troops would be ruin'd as effectual|ly, as if they had been beaten in the Field.</P>
<P>As to their blu&s;tering about <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and threatning to be|&s;iege it with twenty five thou&s;and Men, I may &s;peak of it by it &s;elf; But let us look a little off of their Military Part, to that of their Commerce.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attack they have made upon us there, (for there al&s;o they are Aggre&s;&s;ors) is their publick prohibiting the wearing our Manufacture in their Country; <HI>Prohibiting the Importation follows of Cour&s;e.</HI> How ill they are able to furni&s;h Manufactures, by the Indu&s;try of their own People, to &s;upply the Place of ours, I have mention'd already; but let me ask the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a few Trading Que&s;tions upon this Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Trading Nations never prohibit the Exportation of their own Goods, whether the Growth of their Country, or the Labour of their People. To Prohibit Trade with <HI>England,</HI> is to prohibit the Exportation of their own Growth, which by the way is the main Wealth of their Country; I mean as to its home Product: And can they live without the Trade with <HI>Eng|land?</HI></P>
<P>Have they con&s;ider'd what they &s;hall do, if <HI>England</HI> finding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> refu&s;e to take off their Cloths and Stuffs, their Woollen Manufacture of all Kinds, and their other needful Exports, &s;hould refu&s;e to take off their Wines, Brandies, Oil, Rai&s;ins, Oranges, Lemons, Almonds, Soap, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool? and if <HI>France</HI> &s;hould refu&s;e their Wool and Iron, and all their other Produce? They need not perhaps forbid their Subjects the
<PB N="50" REF="53">
wearing any Silks or Stuffs of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> they would be naked enough; for they would &s;oon have no Money to buy them, and mu&s;t be glad to buy Blankets and Woad|mill of the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Africk,</HI> to cover them.</P>
<P><HI>Xeres de la Fronteira</HI> is a Place near the Coa&s;t, in the Bay between <HI>Cadiz</HI> and <HI>Sevil;</HI> that Country is full of Vines, and they tell us that they make &s;ixty thou&s;and Pipes or Buts of Sherrey every Year, and mo&s;t of this is brought away by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Hamburgers;</HI> but if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> refu&s;e it, how will all that Country live? how will the Vines run wild, and be ruin'd, the People &s;tarve, and have no Employment, and the Lands lye wa&s;te?</P>
<P>The like is to be &s;aid of their Oil and Soap at <HI>Sevil,</HI> of which the Quantity is exceeding great, &s;o that they have one Wood oppo&s;ite to <HI>Sevil</HI> nine Leagues in Circuit, all of Olive-Trees, from which they tell us they make &s;ixteen thou&s;and Quintals of Soap in a Year; but unle&s;s they can &s;ell off this Soap and the Oil to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> &amp;c. all will be wa&s;te, for the Quantity they can con&s;ume at home is next tonothing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canary I&s;lands</HI> have no other con&s;iderable Market for their Wines but to <HI>England,</HI> except what ca&s;ual Ships take off, going to <HI>Africa</HI> or <HI>America;</HI> if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for&s;ake the Place, and leave off the Trade, tho&s;e I&s;lands are undone; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves have always been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that when there has been a War between the two Nations, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has always allow'd the <HI>Canary</HI> Trade to be open to <HI>England,</HI> and to enjoy as it were a Neutrality, that their Wines may be taken off.</P>
<P>From thence let us go on to the South Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and there is fir&s;t <HI>Malaga,</HI> a City flou|ri&s;hing and rich; the Cu&s;toms they &s;ay pay the King of <HI>Spain</HI> eighty thou&s;and Pieces of Eight a Year for that one Port. But with whom is their Trade? I in&s;i&s;t that five Parts of &s;ix of their whole Trade is with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the Wines, e&s;pecially tho&s;e we now call <HI>white Mountain,</HI> (call'd &s;o, becau&s;e they grow on the Sides of the Hills, on all the North Part of <HI>Granada</HI>) who Buys them, and where are they Drank? The <HI>French</HI> buy no Wines, the <HI>Italians</HI> buy no Wines, the <HI>Moors</HI> are all <HI>Mabometans,</HI> they drink none; none but the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and perhaps one Ship or two at mo&s;t to <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Rai|&s;ons, called <HI>Malaga</HI> Raifins, come almo&s;t all to <HI>England;</HI> their Lemons go indeed to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Neighbouring Coa&s;ts; but three times as many to <HI>England,</HI> as to all other Places; and what will the Lo&s;s of &s;uch a Trade be to them? How will the Country be ruin'd, and the People &s;tarv'd, if they cannot put off their Wine and Fruit?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">
The Trade at <HI>Alicant</HI> is much the &s;ame as at <HI>Malaga,</HI> only their Wines are richer; &s;uch as <HI>Tent,</HI> and red <HI>Alicant,</HI> bought u&s;ually to give Strength and Colour to other Wines. Their Raifins are the be&s;t in the World, and are Ship'd off yearly in a prodigious Quantity; but all chiefly to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Trade continues a long way on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Va|lentia:</HI> Upon the <HI>Catalonian</HI> Coa&s;t there is the &s;ame Trade for Wines, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Bene Carlo, Barcellona,</HI> and other Ports; but all for <HI>England;</HI> al&s;o &s;ome Brandy is brought from thence; and who will have the Lo&s;s, if all the&s;e Wines are left upon their Hands?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be the mo&s;t ignorant thing in the World of its kind, to have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> prohibit wearing our Manufactures, when they have no other to wear; and to &s;top the Trade to <HI>England,</HI> when they have no other Market for their General Produce.</P>
<P>But I return now to the Affair of a War: What is <HI>Spain</HI> a doing? They tell us they are drawing an Army together to at|tack <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> but do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> con&s;ider two things?</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That <HI>Gibraltar</HI> is &s;o &s;ituated, that it cannot be at|tack'd? Do they remember that the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Te&s;&s;e</HI> &s;ent the King of <HI>France</HI> Word, that to continue the Siege of <HI>Gibral|tar</HI> would but ruin the whole Infantry, and that forty thou|&s;and Men could never take it by Land?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Do they know, that as &s;oon as they begin this Enterprize, they may expect the <HI>French</HI> with two Armies upon their Frontiers, one on the Side of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and the other on the Side of <HI>Navarr?</HI> and that by drawing their Troops off to the remote&s;t Angle of their va&s;t Country of <HI>Spain,</HI> they mu&s;t leave their Frontiers open to the <HI>French?</HI> and that it will be very hard to bring them back upon an Emergence, when they are at lea&s;t five hundred Miles off?</P>
<P>But we are an&s;wered, That 'tis a Mi&s;take; the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is not forming the Siege of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> he has only ordered a Fort, or &s;ome Forts, to be built in proper Places, and upon his own Lands, which is no Breach of the Peace; for &s;ure he may have the Liberty to do what he plea&s;es upon his own Lands.</P>
<P>We cannot give an An&s;wer to this here, becau&s;e we do not know how far the Fact is true, and we have it yet by Report only. But this we may venture to &s;ay.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Spaniards</HI> build, or fortifie in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> or on the Bay, or Coa&s;t about it, as it reported, 'tis either to incommode the Town and Port of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> or it is not; if it is not, and there is no Rea&s;on to take umbrage at it, or
<PB N="52" REF="55">
complain of it; then I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall not complain of it, for <HI>England</HI> will certainly take no Offence, where no Cau&s;e of Offence is given.</P>
<P>But if this is done with De&s;ign, either to Streighten and Block up the Town, or to incommode the Navigation of the Port and the Commerce; This is in a plain Sen&s;e an Act of Ho&s;tility, and can be taken for no other; and Force is not to be Complain'd of only, but to be Repell'd.</P>
<P>Not but that even in this, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem to be rather &s;howing their Teeth, than any thing el&s;e. Nor does it ap|pear that they are able to do any con&s;iderable Injury to the Port, and none at all to the Town of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> is at lea&s;t five Miles over at the En|trance, that is, from Cape to Cape; and 'tis not le&s;s than three or four Miles over, within the Bay, oppo&s;ite to the Town, and where the old Town of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> &s;tood.</P>
<P>The Depth of Water is &s;uch, that the large&s;t Ships may ride almo&s;t any where; and they have from 30 to 50 Fathom Water, right again&s;t, and near to the Entrance of the Mole, and in the Offing they find no Ground at 100 Fathom, <HI>as ap|pears by the Plan.</HI> Whatever the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can pretend to do by Fortifying the oppo&s;ite Shore, I leave to the Judgment of the Publick; as I do, whether they ought to be allow|ed to Fortify there, or no.</P>
<P>As to any thing they can do by Land to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> I be|lieve the Government are in no great Pain about it; only that they will take Care to put &s;uch a Garri&s;on into it, as may give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> occa&s;ion to be more appehen&s;ive of Di&s;tur|bance from the Town, than the Town from them.</P>
<P>The Town is a <HI>Penin&s;ula:</HI> 'tis to be attack'd no way in Form, but by that &s;mall Neck of Land which joyns it to the Continent of <HI>Spain;</HI> and there the Acce&s;s to it is Naturally &s;o difficult, and by the Addition of Art made &s;o impracticable, that I believe the Garri&s;on are in no Pain about what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can do that way. Upon the Whole, I may &s;ay of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> formerly &s;aid of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI><Q>Il et une Place Terrible</Q></P>
<P>For the farther Information of the Reader, and to make what I have &s;aid be perfectly Intelligible, I have here given a Plan of the Situation, as well of the Bay, as of the Town, and of the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t; by which the Reader will judge, whether the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Act like Men in their Sen&s;es, or no, in pretend|ing to attack the Place, while at the &s;ame Time they know they are not Ma&s;ters of the Sea, or able to hinder its being re|lieved as often as there is Occa&s;ion.<PB REF="56"><TEXT>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus ob&s;erved the angry impotent Di&s;po&s;ition of the Neighbouring Powers in the <HI>Vienna Treaty,</HI> for a War; it remains to inquire, What our Share may be in it? and what <HI>England</HI> has to be frighted and terrify'd at, among all tho&s;e Blu&s;ters and high Words?</P>
<P>For my Part, I have con&s;idered, with all po&s;&s;ible Gravity, every Part of the Thing, and I can &s;ee no Thunder in all the&s;e Clouds; the gathering Vapours may portend &s;ome Storm, but I don't &s;ee it can reach us; I wi&s;h other People would examine it too.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t I can &s;ee in it all, is, that they may put us to &s;ome Expence, and that is (in its Kind) a Grievance, 'tis true; but let the <HI>Spaniards</HI> look out &s;harp; 'tis Ten to One but we may make our &s;elves whole at their Expence, one Way or other. Now and then a Galeon or two falling in our Way, may make us Amends for a whole Expedition; and we mu&s;t have wor&s;e Luck than ordinary, if we chop upon none of them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place; Their Privateering will not give us much Unea&s;ine&s;s in our Trade; a Thing which was always our great Inconvenience in a War, either with the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch.</HI> There are but three Places which will be again&s;t us in this War, where Privateers of any Note are u&s;ually fitted out.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Port of <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Bi&s;cayners,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Ports of St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and St. <HI>Andero.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Majorkins</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of the&s;e have been con&s;iderable, in former Wars. But will be now &s;o &s;urrounded (all the Ports of <HI>Great Bri|tain, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> being &s;hut again&s;t them, and all the Ships of tho&s;e Powers being their Enemies) that I do not &s;ee how they will dare to &s;tir out; or if they &s;hould take a Prize, how they would be able to carry it home; the utmo&s;t they could do, would be to Crui&s;e upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> that they might have the Ports of <HI>Galitia,</HI> or of <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> for their Retreat; and that would not be &s;o fatal to us, but that we might venture them there. But all our Channel Trade, Coal Trade, and Coa&s;t Trade, would be very quiet and un|di&s;turb'd; which three Articles were the great Sufferers in the
<PB N="54" REF="58">
la&s;t Wars with <HI>France,</HI> and are generally &s;o in any War with the Marine Powers on this Side of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;cayams,</HI> again, have the &s;ame Re&s;traint, in its De|gree; for as the <HI>French</HI> are at their Door, and our Trade lying &s;o di&s;tant as the Mouth of the Channel, they mu&s;t go a great way for Purcha&s;e, and have a long Run back again for Safe|ty, when they take a Prize; in which Ca&s;e, 'tis great Odds but they may be met with, by either <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>In the late War, when they had all the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t to be|friend them, and could run into any of their Ports, either in Stre&s;s of Weather, or when chas'd, or when favour'd with a good Prize, then indeed their Ri&s;que was not &s;o great, and &s;ometimes they made a good Hand of it. But I am much mi&s;taken if they will pretend to fit out many Privateers up|on all the Coa&s;ts, as the Ca&s;e is like to &s;tand with them now.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Majorkins</HI> then are the only People left; and their Roving may be confined to the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> where there are three Things to be ob&s;erved, which makes our Trade pretty &s;ecure:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Majorkin</HI> Rovers are all &s;mall, they never carry a|bove Eight, to Twelve, and Sixteen Guns, being rather Sloops, and a kind of Galley-built Ve&s;&s;els, than Ships; made for nimble Sailing, and Roving al&s;o; and they dare not attack Ships of good Force.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mo&s;t of our Ships Trading into tho&s;e Seas, are Ships of good Force, and particularly in Ca&s;e of a War, will be &s;o; from Twenty-four to Thirty-&s;ix Guns, and will &s;eldom go with|out Convoy neither; &s;o that the <HI>Majorkins</HI> will very rarely venture upon them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Majorca</HI> is &s;o Situated between <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Port-Ma|hon,</HI> that they will find it very hard to keep the Seas, without being intercepted by &s;ome of our Men of War, who will be perfectly Ma&s;ters of the Sea, and be always Crui&s;ing be|tween the Straits Mouth and that I&s;land; and al&s;o We&s;tward, between the I&s;land and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Thus, I think, we need not be very anxious for our Trade, on Account of their Privateers. Some few may indeed ap|pear in the Bay of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> fitted out at Port St. <HI>Mary, Sevil,</HI> S. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and tho&s;e Places, and may Crui&s;e off of the South|ward Cape, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Portugal.</HI> But 'tis hoped we may have &s;o good a Look-out there for Galeons, and &s;uch People, that the Privateers will find but little Good upon that Coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="59">
We are told, indeed, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will have Privateers and Crui&s;ers among our I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> the&s;e may, indeed, harbour at the <HI>Havana,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and have &s;everal Skulking Places on the North Side of the Gulph of <HI>Mexico:</HI> But as our Squadron in tho&s;e Seas is already very &s;trong, and likely to be &s;tronger, it may be no difficult Matter to keep tho&s;e Seas clear; and per|haps the <HI>Havana</HI> may not always be a Retreat for them, as &s;trong as it is; of which more may be &s;aid when a War (if it is to be a War) is actually begun.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;tated the Ca&s;e, as to Privateering, let us exa|mine the other great Articles, in which the Enemy think they can wound us; and they are, I think, but two.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Prohibitions of Commerce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Alarms about the Pretender.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Prohibitions of Commerce. It is true, every Prohibition of Commerce to a Trading Country, as this is, may in &s;ome particular Ca&s;e or other be a Lo&s;s, as it &s;tops &s;ome of the Channels of our Trade, by which our great Vent of Woollen Manufacture in particular, is circulated and extended in the World. But it is al&s;o the particular Happine&s;s of our Wool|len Manufacture, that the &s;everal Countries where it is carried and &s;old, are generally in as much want of the Goods, or of the Sale and Con&s;umption of tho&s;e Goods which <HI>England</HI> takes in Return for them, as we can be of the Sale of ours; and in particular, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is eminent for both the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances; as has been mentioned already.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this has always been, that either by Connivance, or by the Interpo&s;ition of Neutral Nations, Trade has always found private Channels of Conveyance; and the Merchants find Ways and Means to furni&s;h them&s;elves on one Hand, and di&s;po&s;e of their Product on the other; &s;o that &s;uch Prohibitions &s;erve indeed to make Things &s;ell for a better Price than ordinary, but &s;eldom put a full Stop to the Trade. Were it &s;o, I dare venture to affirm, <HI>Spain</HI> would be the greate&s;t Lo&s;er by the Prohibition, be&s;ides being far from the be&s;t able to bear it.</P>
<P>What Lengths the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> may go in Prohibitions of Commerce, we yet do not &s;ee; but &s;hould they do their ut|mo&s;t (as I &s;aid above) they would do their own Subjects much more Damage than they can do us. And I appeal to the Experience of the Men of Commerce for Proof of the Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="60">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Suppo&s;e a Stop of Commerce with <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is to &s;ay, with the <HI>Imperial Netherlands,</HI> which is what &s;ome People &s;eem to apprehend.</P>
<P>It is true, they may &s;top the Importation of our Woollen Manufacture thither, tho' with all their Prohibitions Trade will find Vents there too, as well as it has done in <HI>France,</HI> and other Countries; and 'tis pre&s;um'd, the Prohibition mu&s;t be as univer&s;al as the War, that is to &s;ay, with <HI>Holland, France,</HI> and <HI>Great Britain</HI> all together; and how the <HI>Flemings</HI> will find their Account in that, is for them to judge, not for me.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak to it only as to <HI>England.</HI> Pray who will be the greate&s;t Sufferers in &s;uch a Prohibition? <HI>England,</HI> for want of the Vent of &s;ome Woollen Manufacture (tho' indeed not very con&s;iderable) which are u&s;ually &s;ent to <HI>Flanders?</HI> Or the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> for want of the Sale of their <HI>Cambricks</HI> and fine <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Mecblin</HI> Lace? of both which &s;o ex|ceeding a Demand is made here, by the Humour and Fancy of our Ladies running into the Wear and U&s;e of tho&s;e two Articles, and the Price of which is of late &s;o extravagant, that the Ballance of Trade between the two Countries is evidently to the Advantage of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and that in a prodigious Degree. So that I cannot but &s;ay, a Prohibition of Com|merce between them, would be at this Time one of the kind|e&s;t Things the Emperor could do for us, and we &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to be &s;orry or anxious about it, whenever it begins. Our only Bu&s;ine&s;s (at lea&s;t I think &s;o) would be, whenever they make the Prohibition on their Side, to take care it be du|ly Executed on our Side.</P>
<P>There is but one Part of the World more, where the Em|peror can make any con&s;iderable Prohibition of Commerce with us by Sea, and that is in <HI>Italy;</HI> and I am per&s;waded his Council, if they are Men of Common Under&s;tanding in Bu|&s;ine&s;s, will never advi&s;e his Imperial Maje&s;ty to take &s;uch a Step. Let us examine the Particulars briefly:</P>
<P>This Prohibition can only extend to the Ports of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the We&s;t and South Side of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Ports of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina, Palermo,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>Sicily.</HI> In return for which, he fir&s;t of all &s;tops the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> taking off the Oil of <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> and then the Thrown Silk of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily;</HI> and at the &s;ame Time as he has not Power to prohibit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Com|merce at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> the Manufacture of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will be only carried thither, in&s;tead of being carried to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Merchants will &s;end thither to buy them; for we are a&s;&s;ur'd they mu&s;t and will have them.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="61">
In a Word, <HI>Great Britain</HI> laughs at their Prohibitions: Nor can the War, with which they threaten us, be any way fatal to our Trade, no, not in any one Place.</P>
<P>I might &s;ay &s;omething here to the Stop this War might &s;eem to give to the Vent of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies:</HI> But if I &s;hould &s;ay, on the other Hand, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem really not to know what they are doing in that Particular; and that it is more likely, if they don't con&s;i|der it in time, that <HI>England</HI> may open a Door there to the Commerce, which it may never be in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Power to &s;hut up; and that a direct Trade from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>New Spain,</HI> may be a full Satisfaction to us for all their other At|tempts upon our Trade, that they either have made, or can make to our Prejudice; I &s;hould &s;ay nothing but what I could very effectually explain</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their Menacing us with the Pretender; the Damage to Trade being my pre&s;ent Subject, I &s;hall &s;ay little to it here: It is &s;o remote from them as well as from us, they are &s;o little able to do any thing in it, and the Creature him|&s;elf has &s;o little in him to make him Formidable, that I think it hardly worth naming.</P>
<P>Yet one Thing I cannot but ob&s;erve in this (otherwi&s;e in|&s;ignificant) Thing, call'd the Pretender; <HI>viz.</HI> That as it was in the Time of one of the greate&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchs who ever wore the Crown, I mean <HI>Henry</HI> VII, that his Ene|mies, whenever they had a Mind to make him unea&s;y, always play'd one Impo&s;tor or other upon him, &s;uch as <HI>Simnel, Per|kin Warbeck,</HI> and the like, &s;o they would do now.</P>
<P>Thus whenever any Foreign Power de&s;igns to rai&s;e Di&s;tractions among us, and to In&s;ult the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in any Quarter whatever, they will always play the Pretender upon us. If the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has the lea&s;t View of Re&s;entment depending again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> pre&s;ently the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> comes to Court, and has an Audience of his Catholick Maje&s;ty. And the late Earl Mari&s;chal, a <HI>Scots</HI> Refugee (and who it &s;eems is in Com|mi&s;&s;ion under the King of <HI>Spain</HI>) is ordered to &s;et a&s;ide his Journey to <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> and the like; as if by the&s;e remove Motions, <HI>Great Britain</HI> was to be Alarmed, and that it was to be under&s;tood, that &s;omething was doing, or con|triving to be done on that Side, in Favour of that de&s;pica|ble Intere&s;t, call'd Jacobiti&s;m.</P>
<P>I remember we read in the Story of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. That when that fir&s;t Impo&s;ture was Que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed, and Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> (who

was play'd upon that Prince as a Pretender) fell into his Hand; in&s;tead of putting him to Death (as Ju&s;tice indeed demanded) the King, to let his Enemies &s;ee how he con|temned the Attempt, took the poor mi&s;erable Thing and &s;et him in the Royal Kitchin to turn the Spit, and lick the Trenchers, de&s;pi&s;ing thereby not the Per&s;on only, but the Party.</P>
<P>The Inference I think is ju&s;t; <HI>England</HI> has &s;o little to fear from the Pretender, or from the Ne&s;t of Pretenders now in <HI>Italy,</HI> for it &s;eems there is a new Succe&s;&s;ion of Pretenders in the Hands of the Pope and his Prie&s;ts; I &s;ay, <HI>England</HI> has &s;o little to fear from them, that the greate&s;t Contempt is to be put upon all the&s;e little Motions; and they ought to give us no other Alarm, than only to take care to keep Jacobiti&s;m down at home, to keep them in the &s;ame State of Mortifica|tion and Humiliation that they are already in, and then not to fear their Agents from abroad.</P>
<P>In a word, it &s;eems to be the Cafe, as I have already &s;aid in <HI>Spain;</HI> now tho' Jacobiti&s;m is not &s;o incon&s;iderable as not to be worth our &s;etting our Foot upon it, yet 'tis far from being &s;o con&s;iderable as to make us afraid of it. No Thief is &s;o in|con&s;iderable as that we need not &s;hut our Doors and bar our Windows when we go to Bed, to keep them out; but all the Thieves in the Nation are not &s;o con&s;iderable, but that when we have fa&s;tened our Doors, and the Watch is &s;et, we can &s;leep in quiet, and defy them.</P>
<P>Again, I mu&s;t &s;ay, it is a Piece of Kindne&s;s to the Jaco|bites them&s;elves, who as they are a Deluded and Impo&s;ed up|on People, call for &s;ome Pity from even the Government which they offend; and the kinde&s;t thing the Government of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> can do for them, is to take away all their Hopes, foreclo&s;e their Expectations, and &s;how them how impo&s;&s;ible the Re&s;urrection of their Party is, under the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;iti|ons; and how effectually every Back-Door is barred up again&s;t them, that &s;o their Hopes being entirely de&s;troyed, they may learn to de&s;pair, and no more precipitate them|&s;elves into certain Ruin, in attempting to revive a Cau&s;e that is not to be revived.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is worth their while to reflect upon what Foot it is, that the&s;e Foreign People bring their lo&s;t Cau&s;e into the Que&s;tion; <HI>namely,</HI> for nothing but to play it upon the Nation, if po&s;&s;ible, in the Nature of a Diver&s;ion, or to give an Alarm, re&s;erving it always in <HI>Petto,</HI> to give it up whenever they are reduc'd to the Nece&s;&s;ity of making a Peace; and that even
<PB N="59" REF="63">
the greate&s;t Prince that ever e&s;pou&s;ed them, &s;acrificed their whole Intere&s;t, when he found it needful to make a Peace at their Expence.</P>
<P>I had purpo&s;ed here to have enter'd into a u&s;eful, and a &s;e|rious Di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the Expedition to <HI>Porto Belo;</HI> and the Po&s;ting the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron under Admiral <HI>Ho&s;ier,</HI> at the I&s;lands call'd <HI>Les Ba&s;timento's,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>I&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|mus</HI> of <HI>America;</HI> and to have given a like Plan of the Situa|tion of tho&s;e I&s;lands, as I have here of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and how they re&s;pect the Harbour of <HI>Porto Belo;</HI> But as this would require al&s;o, that I &s;hould con&s;ider the great Advantages which lye before us in a formal and further Pro&s;ecution of that Attempt; and how <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the carrying on this War, may give a new Turn to the Commerce of that Part of the World, infinitely to the Advantage of the&s;e I&s;lands, and yet without giving Umbrage to the Allies, by making any Attempts to &s;eize upon the Country it &s;elf; and that I purpo&s;e to handle that Subject by it &s;elf, as &s;oon as the publick Af|fairs di&s;cover them&s;elves, &s;o as to make it acceptable; for that Rea&s;on, and al&s;o, becau&s;e I have not room to &s;peak effectu|ally to it here, I refer it to another Occa&s;ion.</P>
