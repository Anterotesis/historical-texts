<L>THOUGH tender &s;ighs breathe in the tragick page,</L>
<L>What lover now complains&mdash;but on the &s;tage?</L>
<L>No &s;uitor now attempts his rival's life,</L>
<L>But lets him take that cordial balm&mdash;a wife:</L>
<L>And yet, to prove his pure and con&s;tant flame,</L>
<L>Still loves his mi&s;tre&s;s in the wedded dame;</L>
<L>Still courts his friend, and &s;till devoutly bows</L>
<L>At the fair &s;hrine where fir&s;t he breath'd his vows.</L>
<L>For love, &s;he knows &s;ome gratitude is due,</L>
<L>Searches her heart, and finds there's room for two;</L>
<L>And often &s;ees, her coy reluctance o'er,</L>
<L>Good cau&s;e to prize her <HI>caro &s;po&s;o</HI> more.</L>
<L>Thus modi&s;h wives, with &s;entimental &s;pirit,</L>
<L>May go a&s;tray, to prove their hu&s;bands' merit,&mdash;</L>
<L>Or ope the door, in this commodious age,</L>
<L>Without death's aid, to '&s;cape from wedlock's cage.&mdash;</L>
<L>Abjuring rules, that &s;oon will &s;eem romance,</L>
<L>Love's gayer &s;y&s;tem we import from France;</L>
<L>Re&s;cind politely our old Engli&s;h <HI>duty,</HI></L>
<L>And take off all re&s;traints from wine and beauty;</L>
<L>While lighter manners cheer our native gloom,</L>
<L>As Spani&s;h wool refines the Briti&s;h loom.</L>
<L>Had fa&s;hion's law of old &s;uch influence &s;hed,</L>
<L>The raptur'd Claudio ne'er had timele&s;s bled:</L>
<L>His bli&s;s with joy Mentevole had &s;een,</L>
<L>And Julia's favourite Cici&s;he' had been.</L>
<L>The a&s;&s;iduous lover, and the hu&s;band bland,</L>
<L>Like Brentford's kings, had &s;till walk'd hand in hand;</L>
<L>Together &s;till had &s;hone at Park, and play,</L>

<L>Fir&s;t then, without rejoinder or di&s;pute,</L>

<L>But truce with je&s;t. Howe'er the wits may rail,</L>
<L>The cau&s;e of truth and virtue mu&s;t prevail.</L>
<L>Of former times whatever may be told,</L>
<L>We are ju&s;t as good as e'er they were of old.</L>
<L>Connubial Love here long has fix'd his throne,</L>
<L>And bli&s;s is ours, to foreign climes unknown.</L>
<L>If <HI>now and then</HI> a tripping fair is &s;ound,</L>
<L>On Scandal's wings the buzzing tale flies round:</L>
<L>While blamele&s;s <HI>thou&s;ands,</HI> in &s;eque&s;ter'd life,</L>
<L>Adorn each &s;tate, of parent, friend, and wife;</L>
<L>From private cares ne'er wi&s;h abroad to roam,</L>
<L>And ble&s;s, each day, the &s;un&s;hine of their home;</L>
<L>Unnoticed keep their noi&s;ele&s;s happy cour&s;e,</L>
<L>Nor dream of &s;econd wedlock or divorce.&mdash;</L>
<L>I &s;ee the verdict's ours; you &s;mile applau&s;e;</L>
<L>So, with your leave, again I'll plead our cau&s;e;</L>
<L>New triumphs nightly o'er this railer gain,</L>
