<P>THE character of Major Rampart was intend|ed to repre&s;ent one of tho&s;e per&s;ons who imagine they have uttered volumes, without having &s;aid a word: who&s;e eager looks inform us how important they &s;uppo&s;e their own conceptions to be; but, being too mighty for utterance, language &s;inks under them, and they expect the a&s;&s;ent and ap|plau&s;e of their companions to their Humphs? Hays? and expletives. The&s;e expletives, as u&s;ed by the Major, are omitted in repre&s;entation; be|cau&s;e they offended. They are here re&s;tored, and left to the con&s;ideration of the reader. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to add, they &s;hould not be pronoun|ced in an articulate and emphatical manner; but with a half-muttering rapidity: accompanied by equally rapid glances, looking round for, and de|manding, admiration.</P>
