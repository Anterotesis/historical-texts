<HEAD>JOHN the SHOPKEEPER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LONG has the Mu&s;e her tale delay'd,</L>
<L>Has &s;topt to talk of Johnny's trade;</L>
<L>Wife, daughter, mother too, of John,</L>
<L>And quite forgot to travel on.</L>
<L>Long has the Mu&s;e with trembling fear,</L>
<L>View'd the &s;ad &s;cene that now is near;</L>
<L>Hung back indeed from very fright,</L>
<L>And &s;hrunk and &s;tarted at the &s;ight.</L>
<L>As the tall &s;teed, if he &s;hould &s;py</L>
<L>Some unknown form of danger nigh,</L>
<L>Starts from his path, his eye-balls glare,</L>
<L>His feet fly prancing in the air,</L>
<L>Round on the &s;pot and round he wheels,</L>
<L>Upright upon his meer hind heels;</L>
<L>So have we &s;tarted at the view</L>
<L>Of what our John is now to do,</L>
<L>Have gaily fri&s;k'd it round and round,</L>
<L>Nor gain'd as you an inch of ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, gentle Mu&s;e, the tale declare,</L>
<L>Sing how this bold advent'rous pair,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
With mother brave and willing daughter,</L>
<L>March'd to the borders of the water.</L>
<L>Sing how they trod the beech &s;o &s;teep,</L>
<L>Gaz'd at the wonders of the deep,</L>
<L>And &s;topt to view, as in a trance,</L>
<L>The awful ocean's va&s;t expan&s;e,</L>
<L>Then gaz'd at ev'ry pa&s;&s;ing boat,</L>
<L>Till they quite long'd to get on float.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>

<LG>
<L>The Boatmen, as they cro&s;s the Strand,</L>
<L>Spring from an alehou&s;e ju&s;t at hand,</L>
<L>All on the party down they bur&s;t,</L>
<L>And each is &s;ure that he was fir&s;t.</L>
<L>Oh! how they pre&s;s and fill the ground,</L>
<L>And pu&s;h and elbow all around!</L>
<L>Each to a Lady makes his &s;uit,</L>
<L>Till Nancy &s;tarts as at a brute:</L>
<L>While prudent Johnny marching down,</L>
<L>Hires a &s;nug boat for half a crown,</L>
<L>Of &s;maller &s;ize, but &s;tiff and tight;</L>
<L>And having &s;een that all is right,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
Rallies his daughter, claims his wife,</L>
<L>Bur&s;ts thro' the crowd and ends the &s;trife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now with &s;elf-complacent grin,</L>
<L>The favor'd Boatman hands them in;</L>
<L>But fir&s;t he plants, as is his rule,</L>
<L>On the wave's edge his little &s;tool,</L>
<L>And while he begs them to take care,</L>
<L>Pre&s;ents his elbow high in air.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>All in they &s;tept, all down they &s;at;</L>
<L>All &s;afe, all even, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lat:</L>
<L>The Boatman pu&s;hes off the boat;</L>
<L>Was e'er &s;uch trea&s;ure all afloat!</L>
<L>And now amid the &s;un's bright gleam,</L>
<L>See how they cut the &s;ilver &s;tream!</L>
<L>See how the breeze begins to play!</L>
<L>See how it wafts them far away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had the party left the &s;hore,</L>
<L>When Ruffman longs to &s;pare his oar,</L>
<L>Points to the bench where lies a &s;ail,</L>
<L>And begs to profit by the gale.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
At fir&s;t the Boatman's words appal,</L>
<L>And all the female faces fall;</L>
<L>And Madam bets ten thou&s;and pound,</L>
<L>"This in&s;tant we &s;hall be drown'd."</L>
<L>Mean time old Ruffman, with a &s;neer,</L>
<L>Forbids each vain and &s;illy fear;</L>
<L>Talks of the &s;eas that he hath cro&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Beaten, and blown, and tempe&s;t to&s;t;</L>
<L>Tells of his dangers, now no more,</L>
<L>While a green youth in days of yore,</L>
<L>Of feats perform'd by way of fun,</L>
<L>And boa&s;ts of matches he has won:</L>
<L>Then drops his tone, and quite allays</L>
<L>All the new fears he &s;eem'd to rai&s;e;</L>
<L>Pleads his great care, a&s;&s;erts his &s;kill,</L>
<L>Begs each dear Lady'll dread no ill;</L>
<L>For if he keeps the rope in hand,</L>
<L>The water's ju&s;t as &s;afe as land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all objections down he beat,</L>
<L>And now the awful &s;ail is &s;et;</L>
<L>Ah, how they plough the whit'ning &s;eas,</L>
<L>So fine &s;o glorious is the breeze;</L>
<L>How fre&s;h and cooling too the air,</L>
<L>While the &s;ail &s;hades them from the glare;</L>
<L>The Boatman, who a while before</L>
<L>Sat coatle&s;s heated at the oar,</L>
<L>Now lolls his ea&s;e, ob&s;erves the wind,</L>
<L>Steers with one careful hand behind;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
While his right fi&s;t holds hard the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></L>
<L>Re&s;i&s;ts or humours well the gale;</L>
<L>Then half-appearing to turn back,</L>
<L>At once he &s;tops and makes a tack;</L>
<L>Points at the di&s;tant and once more,</L>
<L>And &s;eems to run you right a&s;hore;</L>
<L>But ere he lets you quite touch ground,</L>
<L>Again he &s;pins his ve&s;&s;el round,</L>
<L>And &s;hifts acro&s;s, with &s;kill &s;o nice,</L>
<L>The flutt'ring canvas in a trice;</L>
<L>Scuds o'er the &s;pacious &s;eas again;</L>
<L>Again he plows the mighty main;</L>
<L>Again the le&s;s'ning &s;hore retires,</L>
<L>Woods, hills depart, and di&s;tant &s;pires;</L>
<L>While the bright &s;un, yon clouds between,</L>
<L>Shines forth and gilds the glorious &s;cene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The party, eas'd of all their fright,</L>
<L>Gaze round and round with &s;weet delight;</L>
<L>Prai&s;e with one voice both land and &s;eas,</L>
<L>And now they langui&s;h for a breeze;</L>
<L>Dread le&s;t the &s;lack'ning wind &s;hould fail,</L>
<L>And welcome every growing gale:</L>
<L>Swift o'er the &s;welling waves they fly,</L>
<L>And plea&s;ure beams in ev'ry eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, ah! how oft with genial fun,</L>
<L>While the gay cour&s;e of life we run,</L>
<L>And fancy as we ta&s;te the treat,</L>
<L>Our human bli&s;s is now compleat;&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
How oft in that &s;ame favor'd hour,</L>
<L>Does the whole &s;ky begin to lour!</L>
<L>The cheering &s;un-&s;hine's pa&s;s'd away,</L>
<L>There comes a dreary doleful day:</L>
<L>Afflictions gather like a cloud;</L>
<L>The &s;welling tempe&s;t roars aloud;</L>
<L>While from yon threat'ning heav'ns &s;o dark,</L>
<L>It thunders round our little bark:</L>
<L>Un&s;kill'd to &s;truggle thro' the breeze,</L>
<L>We to&s;s in new and troubled &s;eas,</L>
<L>And life's gay morning all &s;o bright,</L>
<L>Ends in &s;ome woeful tale at night,</L>
