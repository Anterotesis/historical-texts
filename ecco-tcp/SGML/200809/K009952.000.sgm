<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</BYLINE>
<L>A King in bloom of youth, for freedom die!</L>
<L>Our bard, tho' bold, dur&s;t not have &s;oar'd &s;o high.</L>
<L>This is no credulous admiring age;</L>
<L>But &s;acred &s;ure the faith of Plutarch's page.</L>
<L>In &s;imple &s;tile that antient &s;age relates</L>
<L>The tale of Sparta, chief of Grecian &s;tates:</L>
<L>Eight hundred years it flouri&s;h'd, great in arms,</L>
<L>On dangers ro&s;e, and grow amid&s;t alarms.</L>
<L>Of Sparta's triumph you have heard the cau&s;e,</L>
<L>More &s;trong, more noble than Lycurgus' laws:</L>
<L>How Spartan Dames, by glory's charms in&s;pir'd,</L>
<L>The &s;on, the lover, and the hu&s;band fir'd.</L>
<L>Ye Fair of Britain's i&s;le, which ju&s;tly claims</L>
<L>The Grecian title, land of lovely dames,</L>
<L>In Britain's cau&s;e exert your matchle&s;s charms,</L>
<L>And rou&s;e your lovers to the love of arms.</L>
<L>Hid, not extinct, the &s;park of valour lies;</L>
<L>Your breath &s;hall rai&s;e it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aming to the &s;kies.</L>
<L>Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in air,</L>
<L>And bids Britannia's &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ns for war prepare.</L>
<L>Let each lov'd maid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ach mother bring the &s;hield,</L>
<L>And arm their country's champions for the field.</L>
<L>Arm'd and inflam'd each Briti&s;h brea&s;t &s;hall burn,</L>
<L>No youth unlaurel'd &s;hall to you return.</L>
<L>Then &s;hall we cea&s;e t'exult at trophies won,</L>
<L>In glory's field, by Heroes&mdash;not our own.</L>
<L>France yet &s;hall tremble at the Briti&s;h &s;word,</L>
<L>And dread the Vengeance of her antient Lord.</L>
