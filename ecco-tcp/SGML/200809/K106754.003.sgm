<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THROUGHOUT life, there cannot happen an event to arre&s;t the reflection of a thoughtful mind more powerfully, or to leave &s;o la&s;ting an impre&s;&s;ion, as that of returning to a place after a few years ab&s;ence, and ob&s;erving an entire alteration in re&s;pect to all the per&s;ons who once formed the neighbourhood&mdash; To find &s;ome, who but a few years before were left in the bloom of youth and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
health, dead &mdash; to find children left at &s;chool, married, with children of their own &mdash; &s;ome per&s;ons who were in riches, reduced to poverty&mdash;others who were in poverty, become rich &mdash; tho&s;e, once re|nowned for virtue, now dete&s;ted for their vice &mdash; roving hu&s;bands, grown con&s;tant &mdash; con&s;tant ones, become rovers &mdash; the firme&s;t friends, changed to the mo&s;t im|placable enemies&mdash;beauty faded. &mdash; In a word, every change to demon&s;trate "All is tran&s;itory on this &s;ide the grave."</P>
<P>Actuated by a wi&s;h, that the reflective reader may experience the &s;en&s;ation, which an attention to circum&s;tances &s;uch as the&s;e, mu&s;t cau&s;e; he is de&s;ired to imagine &s;eventeen years elap&s;ed, &s;ince he has &s;een or heard of any of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who in the foregoing volumes have been introduced to his acquaintance &mdash; and
<PB N="3" REF="4">
now, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf at the period of tho&s;e &s;eventeen years, follow the &s;equel of their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t female object of this &s;tory.&mdash;The beautiful, the beloved Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;&s;he is no longer beautiful &mdash;no longer beloved&mdash;no longer&mdash;trem|ble while you read it! &mdash; no longer&mdash; virtuous.</P>
<P>Dorriforth, the pious, the good, the tender Dorriforth, is become a hard-hearted tyrant. The compa&s;&s;ionate, the feeling, the ju&s;t Lord Elmwood, an ex|ample of implacable rigour and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley is grown old, but le&s;s with years than grief.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">The child Ru&s;hbrook is become a man, and the apparent heir of Lord Elmwood's fortune; while his own daughter, his only child by his once adored Mi&s;s Milner, he refu&s;es ever to &s;ee again, in vengeance to her mother's crimes.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t wonderful change, is the death of Mrs. Horton. Except</P>
<P>Sandford, who remains much the &s;ame as heretofore.</P>
<P>We left Lady Elmwood in the la&s;t volume at the &s;ummit of human hap|pine&s;s; a loving and beloved bride.&mdash; We begin this volume, and find her upon her death bed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">At thirty-five, her "Cour&s;e was run" &mdash;a cour&s;e full of perils, of hopes, of fears, of joys, and at the end of &s;orrows; all exqui&s;ite of their kind, for exqui&s;ite were the feelings of her &s;u&s;ceptible heart.</P>
<P>At the commencement of this &s;tory, her father is de&s;cribed in the la&s;t mo|ments of his life, with all his cares fixed upon her, his only child&mdash;how vain the&s;e cares! how vain every precaution that was taken for her welfare! She knows, &s;he reflects upon this; and yet, torn by that in&s;tinctive power which a parent feels, Lady Elmwood on her dying day has no worldly thought, but that of the future happine&s;s of <HI>her</HI> only child.&mdash;To every other pro&s;pect before her,
<Q>Thy will be done</Q>
is her continual excla|mation; but where the mi&s;ery of her daughter pre&s;ents it&s;elf, the dying peni|tent
<PB N="6" REF="7">
would there, combat the will of heaven.</P>
<P>To &s;tate the progre&s;&s;ion by which vice gains a predominance in the heart, may be a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on; but it is one &s;o little to the &s;atisfaction of mo&s;t readers, that it is not meant to be related here, all the degrees of frailty by which Lady Elmwood fell; but in&s;tead of picturing every occa&s;ion of her fall, come briefly to the events that followed.</P>
<P>There are, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome articles under the former cla&s;s, which ought not to be entirely omitted.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, after four years pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t perfect enjoyment of happi|ne&s;s, the marriage &s;tate could give; after &s;eeing him&s;elf the father of a beautiful daughter, whom he loved with a tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="8">
nearly equal to his love for her mo|ther, Lord Elmwood was then under the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of leaving them both for a time, in order to &s;ave from the depredation of his &s;teward, a very large e&s;tate in the We&s;t Indies. His voyage was tedious; his re&s;idence there, from various accidents, prolonged from time to time, till near three years had at length pa&s;&s;ed away. &mdash; Lady Elmwood, at fir&s;t only unhappy, became at la&s;t provoked; and giving way to that impatient, irri|table di&s;po&s;ition &s;he had &s;o &s;eldom go|verned, re&s;olved, in &s;pite of his injunc|tions, to divert the melancholy hours his ab&s;ence cau&s;ed, by mixing in the gaie&s;t circles of London. His Lord&s;hip at this time, and for many months before, had been detained abroad by a &s;evere and dangerous illne&s;s, which a too cau|tious fear of her unea&s;ine&s;s had prompted
<PB N="8" REF="9">
him to conceal; and &s;he received his frequent aplogies for not returning, with a &s;u&s;picion and re&s;entment they were calculated, but not intended, to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>To violent anger, &s;ucceeded a degree of indifference &s;till more fatal &mdash; Lady Elmwood's heart was never formed for &s;uch a &s;tate&mdash;there, where all the pa&s;|&s;ions tumultuous &s;trove by turns, one among them &s;oon found the means to occupy all vacancies &mdash; that one was love. &mdash; The dear object of her fonde&s;t, true&s;t, affections was away; and tho&s;e affections painted the time &s;o irk&s;ome that was pa&s;t; &s;o weari&s;ome that, which was &s;till to come; &s;he flew from the pre&s;ent tedious &s;olitude, to the dangerous &s;ociety of one, who&s;e every care to charm her, could not repay her for a moment's lo&s;s of him, who&s;e ab&s;ence he &s;upplied.&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Or if the delirium gave her a moment's recompen&s;e, what were her &s;ufferings and remor&s;e, when &s;he was awakened from the &s;leeting joy by the unexpec|ted arrival of her hu&s;band? &mdash; How happy, how tran&s;porting, had been that arrival a few months before!&mdash;As it had then been felicitous, it was now bitter&mdash; this word, however, weakly expre&s;&s;es&mdash; Language affords none, to de&s;cribe Lady Elmwood's &s;en&s;ations on being told her Lord was arrived, and that nece&s;&s;ity only had &s;o long delayed his return.</P>
<P>Guilty, but not hardened in her guilt, her pangs, her &s;hame were the more exce&s;|&s;ive. She fled the place at his approach; fled his hou&s;e, never again to return to a habitation where he was the ma&s;ter.&mdash; She did not, however, e&s;cape with her paramour, but eloped to &s;helter her&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="11">
in the mo&s;t dreary retreat; where &s;he partook of no one comfort from &s;ociety, or from life, but the &s;till unremitting friend&s;hip of Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;Even her infant daughter &s;he left behind, nor would allow her&s;elf the con&s;olation of her innocent, but reproachful, &s;miles&mdash; &s;he left her in her father's hou&s;e that &s;he might be under his protection; parted with her, as &s;he thought for ever, with all the agonies that mothers part from their infant children: and yet even a mother &s;carcely can conceive how much more &s;harp tho&s;e agonies were, on be|holding the child &s;ent after her, as the perpetual outca&s;t of its father.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's love to his lady had been extravagant&mdash;the effect of his hate was extravagant likewi&s;e. Beholding him&s;elf &s;eparated from her by a barrier
<PB N="11" REF="12">
never to be removed, he vowed in the deep torments of his revenge, not to be reminded of her by one individual object; much le&s;s by one &s;o nearly al|lied to her as her child. To be&s;tow upon that his affections, would be, he imagined, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort, to divide them with the mother.&mdash;Firm in his re|&s;olution, the beautiful Matilda was, at the age of &s;ix years, &s;ent out of her fa|ther's hou&s;e, and received by her mother with the tenderne&s;s, but with the angui&s;h, of tho&s;e parents, who behold their off|&s;pring vi&s;ited with the puni&s;hment due only to their own offences.</P>
<P>During this tran&s;action, which was performed by his Lord&s;hip's agents at his command, he him&s;elf was engaged in an affair of &s;till weightier importance &mdash;that of life or death:&mdash;he determined
<PB N="12" REF="13">
upon his own death, or the death of the man who had wounded his honour and his happine&s;s. A duel with his old an|tagoni&s;t was the re&s;ult of this determina|tion; nor was the Duke of Avon (before the decea&s;e of his father and elde&s;t bro|ther, Lord Frederick Lawnly) backward to render all the &s;atisfaction that was re|quired. &mdash; For it was no other than he, who&s;e love for Lady Elmwood had &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and who&s;e art and indu&s;try left no means une&s;&s;ayed to perfect his de|&s;igns;&mdash;No other than he, (who, next to Lord Elmwood, was ever of all her lovers mo&s;t prevalent in her heart,) to whom Lady Elmwood yielded her own and her hu&s;band's future peace, and gave to his vanity a prouder triumph, than if &s;he had never given her hand in preference to another. This triumph however was but &s;hort &mdash; a month only,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
after the return of Lord Elmwood, his Grace was called upon to an&s;wer for his conduct, and was left upon the &s;pot where they met, &s;o maimed, and defaced with &s;cars, as never again to endanger the honour of a hu&s;band. As Lord Elm|wood was inexorable to all accommoda|tion; their engagement la&s;ted for &s;ome &s;pace of time; nor any thing but the &s;teadfa&s;t a&s;&s;urance his opponent was &s;lain, could at la&s;t have torn his Lord&s;hip from the field, though he him&s;elf was mor|tally wounded.</P>
<P>Yet even during that period of his danger, while for days he laid in the continual expectation of his own death, not all the entreaties of his deare&s;t, mo&s;t intimate, and mo&s;t re&s;pected friends could prevail upon him to pronounce forgivene&s;s to his wife, or &s;uffer them to
<PB N="14" REF="15">
bring his daughter to him for his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Lady Elmwood, who was made ac|quainted with the minute&s;t circum&s;tance as it pa&s;&s;ed, appeared to wait the news of her lord's decea&s;e with patience; but upon her brow, and in every lineament of her face it was marked, his death was an event &s;he would not for a day &s;urvive &mdash; and &s;he had left her child an orphan, to have followed Lord Elmwood to the grave.&mdash;She was prevented the trial; he recovered; and from the ample and di&s;|tingui&s;hed vengeance he had obtained upon the irre&s;i&s;tible per&s;on of the Duke, in a &s;hort time &s;eemed to regain his u&s;ual tranquillity.</P>
<P>He recovered, while Lady Elmwood fell &s;ick and lingered&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of youth and a good con&s;titution, &s;he lingered till
<PB N="15" REF="16">
ten years decline, brought her to that period, with which the reader is now going to be pre&s;ented.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IN a lonely country on the borders of Scotland, a &s;ingle hou&s;e by the &s;ide of a dreary heath, was the re&s;idence of the once gay, volatile Mi&s;s Milner &mdash; In a large gloomy apartment of this &s;olitary habitation (the windows of which &s;carce rendered the light acce&s;&s;ible) was laid upon her death-bed, the once lovely Lady Elmwood &mdash; pale, half &s;uffocated with the lo&s;s of breath; yet her &s;en&s;es perfectly clear and collected, which &s;erved but to &s;harpen the angui&s;h of dying.</P>
<P>In one corner of the room, by the &s;ide of an old-fa&s;hioned &s;tool, kneels Mi&s;s Woodley, praying mo&s;t devoutly
<PB N="17" REF="18">
for her &s;till beloved friend, but in vain endeavouring to pray compo&s;edly &mdash; floods of tears pour down her furrowed cheeks, and frequent &s;obs of &s;orrow break through each pious ejaculation.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e by her mother's &s;ide, one hand &s;upporting her head, the other wiping from her face the damp dew of death, behold Lady Elmwood's daughter &mdash; Lord Elmwood's daughter too&mdash;yet he far away, negligent of what either &s;uf|fers.&mdash;Lady Elmwood turns to her often and attempts an embrace, but her feeble arms forbid, and they fall motion|le&s;s.&mdash;The daughter perceiving tho&s;e in|effectual efforts, has her whole face con|vul&s;ed with &s;orrow; ki&s;&s;es her mother; holds her to her bo&s;om; and hangs upon her neck, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to cling there, and the grave not to part them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">On the other &s;ide the bed &s;its Sand|ford&mdash;his hair grown white&mdash;his face wrinkled with age&mdash;his heart the &s;ame as ever&mdash;The reprover, the enemy of the vain, idle, and wicked; but the friend, the comforter of the forlorn and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Upon tho&s;e features where &s;arca&s;m, re|proach, and anger dwelt to threaten and alarm the &s;inner; mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and pity beamed, to &s;upport and con&s;ole the penitent. Compa&s;&s;ion changed his language, and &s;oftened all tho&s;e har&s;h tones that u&s;ed to denounce re&s;entment.</P>
<P>"In the name of God," &s;aid he to Lady Elmwood, "that God who &s;uf|fered for you, and, &s;uffering, knew and pitied all our weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;By him, who has given his word to <HI>take compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;inner's tears,</HI> I bid you hope for
<PB N="19" REF="20">
mercy.&mdash;By that innocence in which you once lived, be comforted&mdash;By the &s;or|rows you have known &s;ince your degra|dation, hope, in &s;ome degree, to have atoned &mdash; By that &s;incerity which &s;hone upon your youthful face when I joined your hands; tho&s;e thou&s;and vir|tues you have at times given proof of, you were not born to die <HI>the death of the wicked.</HI>"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke the&s;e words of con&s;ola|tion, her trembling hand cla&s;ped his&mdash; her dying eyes darted a ray of bright|ne&s;s&mdash;but her failing voice endeavoured, in vain, to articulate.&mdash;At length, her eyes fixing upon her daughter as their la&s;t dear object, &s;he was ju&s;t under&s;tood to utter the word "Father."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," replied Sand|ford, "and by all that influence I ever
<PB N="20" REF="21">
had over him, by my prayers, my tears," (and they flowed at the word) "I will implore him to own his child."</P>
<P>She could now only &s;mile, in thanks.</P>
<P>"And if I &s;hould fail," continued he, "yet while I live, &s;he &s;hall not want a friend or protector&mdash;all an old man like me can an&s;wer for"&mdash;here his tears interrupted him.</P>
<P>Lady Elmwood was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;i|ble of his words and their import, to make a &s;ign as if &s;he wi&s;hed to embrace him; but finding her life leaving her fa&s;t, &s;he re&s;erved this la&s;t token of love for her daughter&mdash;With a &s;truggle &s;he lifted her&s;elf from her pillow, clung to her child&mdash;and died in her arms.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Elmwood was by nature, and more from education, of a &s;erious, think|ing, and philo&s;ophic turn of mind. His religious &s;tudies had completely taught him to con&s;ider this world but as a pa&s;|&s;age to another; to enjoy with gratitude what Heaven in its bounty &s;hould be|&s;tow, and to bear with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, all which in its vengeance it might inflict&mdash; In a greater degree than mo&s;t people he practi&s;ed this doctrine; and as &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;hock he received from Lady Elmwood's conduct was abated, an en|tire calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation en&s;ued; but &s;till of that &s;en&s;ible and feeling kind, which could never force him to forget the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
happine&s;s he had lo&s;t; and it was this &s;en&s;ibility, which urged him to fly from its more keen recollection as much as po&s;&s;ible &mdash; this he alledged as the rea&s;on he would never &s;uffer Lady Elmwood, or even her child, to be named in his hearing. But this injunction (which all his friends, and even the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e who attended his per&s;on, had re|ceived) was, by many people, &s;u&s;pected rather to proceed from his re&s;entment, than his tenderne&s;s; nor did he him&s;elf deny, that re&s;entment mingled with his prudence; for prudence he called it not to remind him&s;elf of happine&s;s he could never ta&s;te again, and of ingratitude that might impel him to hatred; and prudence he called it, not to form ano|ther attachment near to his heart; more e&s;pecially &s;o near as a parent's, which might a &s;econd time expo&s;e him
<PB N="23" REF="24">
to all the torments of ingratitude, from one whom he affectionately loved.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles he formed the un|&s;haken re&s;olution, never to acknowledge Lady Matilda as his child&mdash;or acknow|ledging her as &s;uch&mdash;never to &s;ee, hear of, or take one concern whatever in her fate and fortune. The death of her mo|ther appeared a favourable time, had he been &s;o inclined, to have recalled this declaration which he had &s;olemnly and repeatedly made&mdash;&s;he was now de&s;titute of the protection of her other parent, and it became his duty, at lea&s;t to pro|vide her a guardian, if he did not choo&s;e to take that tender title upon him&s;elf.&mdash; But to mention either the mother or child to Lord Elmwood was an equal offence, and prohibited in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to all his friends and hou&s;ehold: and as he
<PB N="24" REF="25">
was an excellent good ma&s;ter, a &s;incere friend, and a mo&s;t generous patron; not one of his acquaintance or dependants, were hardy enough to draw upon them|&s;elves his certain, di&s;plea&s;ure, which was violent in the extreme, by even the of|ficial intelligence of Lady Elmwood's death.</P>
<P>Sandford him&s;elf, intimidated through age, or by the au&s;tere, and even moro&s;e, manners Lord Elmwood had of late years adopted; Sandford wi&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome other would undertake the dange|rous ta&s;k of recalling to his Lord&s;hip's memory, there ever was &s;uch a per&s;on as his wife. He advi&s;ed Mi&s;s Woodley to indite a proper letter to him on the &s;ubject; but &s;he reminded him, &s;uch a &s;tep was &s;till more perilous in her, than any other per&s;on, as &s;he was the mo&s;t de&s;titute
<PB N="25" REF="26">
being on earth, without the benevolence of Lord Elmwood. The death of her aunt, Mrs. Horton, had left her &s;ole reliance on Lady Elmwood; and now her death, had left her totally dependant upon the earl&mdash;for her Lady&s;hip, long before her decea&s;e, had declared it was not her intention, to leave a &s;ingle &s;entence be|hind her in the form of a will&mdash;She had no will, &s;he &s;aid, but what &s;he would wholly &s;ubmit to Lord Elmwood's; and, if it were even his will, her child &s;hould live in poverty, as well as bani&s;hment, it &s;hould be &s;o.&mdash; But, perhaps, in this implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Lord&s;hip, there was a di&s;|tant hope that the nece&s;&s;itous &s;ituation of his daughter might plead more forcibly than his parental love; and that knowing her abandoned of every &s;upport but through him&s;elf, that idea might form &s;ome little
<PB N="26" REF="27">
tie between them; and be at lea&s;t a token of the relation&s;hip.</P>
<P>But as Lady Elmwood anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed this principle upon which &s;he acted, &s;hould be concealed from his Lord|&s;hip's &s;u&s;picion, &s;he included her friend, Mi&s;s Woodley, in the &s;ame fate; and thus, the only per&s;ons dear to her, &s;he left, but at Lord Elmwood's plea&s;ure, to be pre&s;erved from peri&s;hing in want.&mdash;Her child was too young to advi&s;e her on this &s;ubject, her friend too di&s;intere&s;ted; and at this moment they were both with|out the &s;malle&s;t means of &s;upport, except through the ju&s;tice or compa&s;|&s;ion of his Lord&s;hip. &mdash; Sandford had, indeed, promi&s;ed his protection to the daughter; but his liberality had no other &s;ource than from his patron, with whom he &s;till lived as u&s;ual, except during the
<PB N="27" REF="28">
winter when his Lord&s;hip re&s;ided in town, he then mo&s;tly &s;tole a vi&s;it to Lady Elmwood&mdash;On this la&s;t vi&s;it, he &s;taid to &s;ee her buried.</P>
<P>After &s;ome mature deliberations, Sand|ford was now preparing to go to Lord Elmwood at his hou&s;e in town, and there to deliver him&s;elf the news that mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be told; and he meant al&s;o to venture, at the &s;ame time, to keep the promi&s;e he had made to his dying Lady &mdash; but the news reached Lord Elmwood before Sandford arrived; it was announced in the public papers, and by that means came fir&s;t to his knowledge.</P>
<P>He was breakfa&s;ting by him&s;elf, when the new&s;paper that fir&s;t gave the intelli|gence of Lady Elmwood's death, was
<PB N="28" REF="29">
laid before him&mdash;the paragraph con|tained the&s;e words:</P>
<Q>On Wedne&s;day la&s;t died, at Dring Park, a village in Northumberland, the right honourable Counte&s;s Elmwood&mdash; This lady, who has not been heard of for many years in the fa&s;hionable world, was a rich heire&s;s, and of extreme beau|ty; but although &s;he received overtures from many men of the fir&s;t rank, &s;he preferred her guardian, the pre&s;ent Lord Elmwood (then the humble Mr. Dorriforth) to them all&mdash;and it is &s;aid, they enjoyed an uncommon &s;hare of fe|licity, till his Lord&s;hip going abroad, and remaining there &s;ome time, the con&s;equences (to a mo&s;t captivating young woman left without a protector) were &s;uch, as to cau&s;e a &s;eparation on his return.&mdash;Her Lady&s;hip has left one child, a daughter, about fifteen.</Q>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">Lord Elmwood had &s;o much feeling upon reading this, as to lay down the paper, and not take it up again for &s;everal minutes &mdash; nor did he ta&s;te his chocolate during this interval, but leaned his el|bow on the table and re&s;ted his head upon his hand. &mdash; He then ro&s;e up &mdash; walked two or three times acro&s;s the room &mdash; &s;at down again &mdash; took up the paper&mdash;and read as u&s;ual.&mdash;Nor let the vociferous mourner, or the perpetual weeper, here complain of his want of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;but let them remember Lord Elmwood was a man &mdash; a man of under|&s;tanding &mdash; of courage &mdash; of fortitude &mdash; with all, a man of the nice&s;t feelings&mdash; and who &s;hall &s;ay, but that at the time he leaned his head upon his hand, and ro&s;e to walk away the &s;en&s;e of what he felt, he might not feel as much as Lady Elmwood did in her la&s;t moments.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">Be this as it may, his Lord&s;hip's &s;u&s;|ceptibility on the occa&s;ion was not &s;u&s;|pected by any one &mdash; he pa&s;&s;ed that day the &s;ame as u&s;ual; the next day too, and the day after.&mdash;On the morning of the fourth day, he &s;ent for his &s;teward to his &s;tudy, and after talking of other bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"Is it true that Lady Elmwood is dead?"</P>
<P>"It is, my Lord." replied the man.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip looked unu&s;ually grave, and at this reply, fetched an involuntary &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford," my lord, continued the &s;teward, "&s;ent me word of the news, but left it to my own di&s;cretion, whether I made your Lord&s;hip acquainted with it or not."</P>
<P>"Where is Sandford?" a&s;ked Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">"He was with my Lady." replied the &s;teward.</P>
<P>"When &s;he died?" a&s;ked his Lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Yes, my Lord."</P>
<P>"I am glad of it &mdash; he will &s;ee every thing &s;he de&s;ired done. &mdash; Sandford is a good man, and would be a friend to every body."</P>
<P>"He is a very good man indeed, my Lord."</P>
<P>There was now a &s;ilence.&mdash;Mr. Gif|fard then bowing, &s;aid, "Has your Lord&s;hip any farther commands?"</P>
<P>"Write to Sandford," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, he&s;itating as he &s;poke, "and tell him to have every thing performed as &s;he de&s;ired.&mdash;And whoever &s;he may have &s;elected for the guardian of her child, has my con&s;ent to act as &s;uch.&mdash; Nor in one in&s;tance, where I my&s;elf am
<PB N="32" REF="33">
not concerned, will I contradict her will." &mdash;The tears ru&s;hed to his eyes as he &s;aid this, and cau&s;ed them to &s;tart in the &s;teward's &mdash; ob&s;erving which, he &s;ternly re&s;umed,</P>
<P>"Do not &s;uppo&s;e from this conver&s;a|tion, that any of tho&s;e re&s;olutions I have long &s;ince taken are, or will be, changed &mdash;they are the &s;ame; and &s;hall continue the &s;ame: &mdash; and your interdiction, Sir, (as well as every other per&s;on's) remains ju&s;t the &s;ame as formerly; never to men|tion this &s;ubject to me in future."</P>
<P>"My Lord, I always obeyed you," replied Mr. Giffard, "and hope I al|ways &s;hall."</P>
<P>"I hope &s;o too." replied his Lord|&s;hip, in a threatening accent &mdash;"Write to Sandford," continued he, "to let him know my plea&s;ure, and that is all you have to do."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">The &s;teward bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>But before his letter arrived to Sand|ford, Sandford arrived in town; and Mr. Giffard related to him word for word what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and his Lord. &mdash; Upon every occa&s;ion, and upon every topic, except that of Lady Elmwood and her child, Sandford was ju&s;t as free with Lord Elmwood as he had ever been; and as u&s;ual (after his interview with the &s;teward) went into his Lord&s;hip's apartment without any pre|vious notice. His Lord&s;hip &s;haked him by the hand as upon all other meetings; and yet, whether his fears &s;ugge&s;ted it or not, Sandford thought he appeared more cool and re&s;erved with him than common.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">During the whole day, the &s;lighte&s;t mention of Lady Elmwood, or of her child, was cautiou&s;ly avoided&mdash;and not till the evening, (after Sandford had rung for his candle to retire to re&s;t, it was brought, and he had wi&s;hed his Lord&s;hip good night) did he dare to mention the &s;ub|ject.&mdash;He then, after taking leave, and going to the door&mdash;turned back and &s;aid, "My Lord,"&mdash;</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s on what he was preparing to &s;peak&mdash;his voice failed, the tears began to trickle down his cheeks, he took out his handkerchief, and could proceed no farther.</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, angrily, "I thought I had given my orders upon this &s;ubject &mdash; did not my &s;teward write them to you?"</P>
<P>"He did, my Lord," &s;aid Sandford,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
humbly, "but I was &s;et out before they arrived."</P>
<P>"Has he not <HI>told</HI> you my mind then?" cried his Lord&s;hip, more angrily &s;till.</P>
<P>"He has;" replied Sandford, &mdash; "But"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But what, Sir?"&mdash;cried Lord Elm|wood.</P>
<P>"Your Lord&s;hip," continued Sand|ford, "was mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing Lady Elmwood left a will; &s;he left none."</P>
<P>"No will? no will at all?"&mdash;&s;aid his Lord&s;hip, &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>"No, my Lord," an&s;wered Sandford, "&s;he wi&s;hed every thing to be as you willed."</P>
<P>"She left me all the trouble, then, you mean?"</P>
<P>"No great trouble, Sir; for except two per&s;ons, her Lady&s;hip has not left any one el&s;e to hope for your protection."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">"And who are tho&s;e two?" cried he ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"One, my Lord, I need not name&mdash; the other is Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>There was a delicacy and an humility, in the manner in which Sandford deli|vered this reply, that Lord Elmwood could <HI>not</HI> re&s;ent, and he only returned,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, is &s;he yet living?"</P>
<P>"She is &mdash; I left her at the hou&s;e I came from."</P>
<P>"Well, then," an&s;wered his Lord|&s;hip, "you mu&s;t &s;ee that my &s;teward provides for tho&s;e two per&s;ons.&mdash;That care I leave to you&mdash;and &s;hould there be any complaints, on you they fall."</P>
<P>Sandford bowed and was going.</P>
<P>"And now," re&s;umed his Lord&s;hip, in a &s;tern and exalted voice, "let me <HI>never</HI> hear again on this &s;ubject. &mdash; You have full power to act in regard to the
<PB N="37" REF="38">
per&s;ons you have mentioned; and upon you their &s;ituation, their care, their whole management depend &mdash; but be &s;ure, you never let them be named before me, from this moment."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Sandford, "as this mu&s;t be the la&s;t time they are mentioned, I mu&s;t now take the opportunity to di&s;|burthen my mind of a charge"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What charge?" &mdash; cried his Lord|&s;hip, moro&s;ely interrupting him.</P>
<P>"Though Lady Elmwood, my Lord, left no will behind, &s;he left a reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"Reque&s;t"&mdash;&s;aid his Lord&s;hip, &s;tart|ing&mdash;"If it is for me to &s;ee her daughter, I tell you now before you a&s;k, I will not grant it &mdash; for by heaven (and he &s;poke and looked mo&s;t &s;olemnly) though I have no re&s;entment to the innocent child, and wi&s;h her happy, yet I will never &s;ee her.&mdash;Never, for her mother's &s;ake, &s;uffer
<PB N="38" REF="39">
my heart to be again &s;oftened by an ob|ject I might doat on.&mdash;Therefore, Sir, if that is the reque&s;t, it is already an&s;wered; my will is fixed."</P>
<P>"The reque&s;t, my Lord," replied Sandford, (taking out a pocket book from whence he drew &s;everal papers) "is contained in this letter; nor do I rightly know what its contents are."&mdash; And he held it out to him.</P>
<P>"Is it Lady Elmwood's writing?" cried his Lord&s;hip, extremely di&s;com|po&s;ed."</P>
<P>"It is, my Lord&mdash;She called for ink and paper and wrote it a few days before &s;he died, and enjoined me to deliver it to you, with my own hands."</P>
<P>"I refu&s;e to read it."&mdash;cried he, put|ting it from him&mdash;and trembling while he did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">"She de&s;ired me," &s;aid Sandford, (&s;till pre&s;enting the letter) "to conjure you to read it, <HI>for her father's &s;ake.</HI>"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood took it in&s;tantly.&mdash;But as &s;oon as it was in his hand, he &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to know what he &s;hould do with it&mdash;in what place, to go to read it&mdash;or how fortify him&s;elf again&s;t its contents. &mdash; He appeared a&s;hamed too, that he had been &s;o far prevailed upon, and &s;aid, by way of excu&s;e,</P>
<P>"For Mr. Milner's &s;ake I would do much &mdash; nay, any thing, but that to which, I have ju&s;t now &s;worn never to con&s;ent.&mdash;For his &s;ake I have borne a great deal&mdash;for his &s;ake alone, his daugh|ter died my wife.&mdash;You know, no other motive than re&s;pect for him, prevented my divorcing her.&mdash;Pray (and he he|&s;itated) was &s;he buried with him?"</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">"No, my Lord &mdash; &s;he expre&s;&s;ed no &s;uch de&s;ire; and as that was the ca&s;e, I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to carry the corp&s;e &s;o far."</P>
<P>At the word corp&s;e, Lord Elmwood &s;hrunk, and looked &s;hocked beyond mea&s;ure &mdash; but recovering him&s;elf, &s;aid, "I am &s;orry for it;&mdash;for he loved <HI>her</HI> &s;incerely, if &s;he did not love him&mdash;and I wi&s;h they had been buried together.</P>
<P>"It is not then too late," &s;aid Sand|ford, and was going on &mdash; but his Lord|&s;hip interrupted him.</P>
<P>"No, no&mdash;we will have no di&s;turbing of the dead."</P>
<P>"Read her letter then," &s;aid Sand|ford, "and bid her re&s;t in peace."</P>
<P>"If it is in my power," returned his Lord&s;hip, "to grant what &s;he a&s;ks I will &mdash; but if her demand is what I ap|prehend, I cannot, I will not, bid her
<PB N="41" REF="42">
re&s;t by complying &mdash;You know my re&s;o|lution, and my di&s;po&s;ition, and take care how you provoke me.&mdash; You may do an injury to the very per&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you are &s;eek|ing to befriend &mdash; the very maintenance I mean to allow her daughter I can withdraw."</P>
<P>Poor Sandford, all alarm at this me|nace, replied with energy, "My Lord, unle&s;s you begin the &s;ubject, I never will pre&s;ume to mention it again."</P>
<P>"I take you at your word,"&mdash;returned his Lord&s;hip," and in con&s;equence of that, and that alone, we are friends.&mdash; Good night, Sir."</P>
<P>Sandford bowed with all humility, and they went to their &s;eparate bedchambers.</P>

<P>AFTER Lord Elmwood had retired into his chamber, it was &s;ome time before he read the letter Sandford had given him. He fir&s;t walked back|wards and forwards in the room &mdash; he then began to take off &s;ome part of his dre&s;s, but did it &s;lowly. At length he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his valet, and &s;itting down, took the letter from his pocket. &mdash; He looked at the &s;eal, but not at the direc|tion; for he &s;eemed to dread to &s;ee Lady Elmwood's hand writing.&mdash;He then laid it on the table, and began again to un|dre&s;s. He did not proceed, but taking up the letter quickly, (with a kind of
<PB N="43" REF="44">
effort in making the re&s;olution) broke it open. The&s;e were its contents:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Who writes this letter I well know &mdash;I well know al&s;o to whom it is ad|dre&s;&s;ed &mdash; I feel with the mo&s;t power+ful force both our &s;ituations;&mdash;nor &s;hould I dare to offer you even this humble petition, but that at the time you receive it, there will be no &s;uch per&s;on as I am in exi&s;tance.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, then, all concern will be over&mdash;but there is a care that pur|&s;ues me to the grave, and threatens my want of repo&s;e even there.</P>
<P>I leave a child&mdash;I will not call her mine, that has undone her&mdash;I will not call her yours, that will be of no avail.
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&mdash;I pre&s;ent her before you as the grand daughter of Mr. Milner. &mdash; Oh! do not refu&s;e an a&s;&s;ylum even in your own hou&s;e, to the de&s;titute offspring of your friend; the la&s;t, and only remaining branch of his family.</P>
<P>Receive her into your hou&s;ehold, be her condition there ever &s;o abject. &mdash; I cannot write di&s;tinctly what I would &mdash; my &s;en&s;es are not impaired, but the powers of expre&s;&s;ion are.&mdash;The unfortunate child in the &s;cripture (a le&s;&s;on I have &s;tudied) his complaint, has made this wi&s;h cling &s;o fa&s;t to my heart, that without the di&s;tant hope of its being fulfilled, death would have more terrors than my weak mind could &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
I will go to my father; how many &s;ervants live in my father's hou&s;e, and are fed with plenty, while I &s;tarve in a foreign land?</P>
<P>I do not a&s;k a parent's fe&s;tive rejoic|ing at her approach&mdash;I do not even a&s;k her father to behold her;&mdash;but let her live under his protection.&mdash; For her grandfather's &s;ake do not refu&s;e this&mdash; to the child of his child whom he tru&s;ted to your care, do not refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Be her ho&s;t; I remit the tie of being her parent. &mdash; Never &s;ee her&mdash; but let her &s;ometimes live under the &s;ame roof with you.</P>
<P>It is Mi&s;s Milner your ward, to whom you never refu&s;ed a reque&s;t, &s;uplicates you&mdash;not now for your ne|phew Ru&s;hbrook, but for one &s;o much
<PB N="46" REF="47">
more dear, that a denial&mdash;&s;he dares not &s;uffer her thoughts to glance that way &mdash; She will hope &mdash; and in that hope, bids you farewell, with all the love &s;he ever bore you.</P>
<P>Farewell Lord Elmwood&mdash;and be|fore you throw this letter from you with contempt or anger, ca&s;t your imagi|nation into the gravewhere I am lying. &mdash;Reflect upon all the days of my pa&s;t life &mdash; the anxious moments I have known, and what has been their end.&mdash; Behold <HI>me,</HI> al&s;o&mdash;in my altered face there is no anxiety&mdash;no joy or &s;orrow &mdash;all is over.&mdash;My whole frame is motionle&s;s&mdash;my heart beats no more. &mdash;Look at my horrid habitation, too, &mdash;and a&s;k your&s;elf&mdash;whether I am an object of re&s;entment?</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">While Lord Elmwood read this letter, it trembled in his hand: he once or twice wiped the tears from his eyes as he read, and once laid the letter down for a few minutes. At its conclu&s;ion the tears flowed fa&s;t down his face; but he &s;eemed both a&s;hamed and angry they did, and was going to throw the paper upon the fire; he however &s;uddenly checked his hand, and putting it ha&s;tily into his pocket, went to bed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, when Lord Elm|wood and Sandford met at breakfa&s;t, Sandford was pale with fear for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of Lady Elmwood's letter&mdash;his Lord|&s;hip was pale too, but there was be&s;ide upon his face &s;omething which evidently marked he was di&s;plea&s;ed&mdash;Sandford ob|&s;erved it, and was all humblene&s;s, both in his words and looks, in order to &s;often him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the breakfa&s;t was removed, his Lord&s;hip drew Lady Elmwood's let|ter from his pocket, and holding it to|wards Sandford, &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">"That may be of more value to you, than it is to me, therefore I give it you."</P>
<P>Sandford called up a look of &s;urpri&s;e, as if he did not know the letter again.</P>
<P>"'Tis Lady Elmwood's letter," &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, "and I give it to you for two rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>Sandford took it, and putting it up, a&s;ked fearfully "What tho&s;e two rea&s;ons were?"</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t," &s;aid Lord Elmwood, "be|cau&s;e I think it is a relick you may like to pre&s;erve&mdash;my &s;econd rea&s;on is, that you may &s;how it to her daughter, and let her know why, and on what conditions I grant her mother's reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"You do then grant it?" cried Sand|ford joyfully; "I thank you &mdash; you are kind&mdash;you are con&s;iderate."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">"Be not too ha&s;ty in your gratitude," returned his Lord&s;hip, "you may have cau&s;e to recall it."</P>
<P>"I know what you have &s;aid," re|plied Sandford, "You have &s;aid you grant Lady Elmwood's reque&s;t &mdash; you cannot recall the&s;e words, nor I my gra|titude."</P>
<P>"Do you know what her reque&s;t is?" &s;aid Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"Not exactly, my Lord&mdash;I told you before, I did not; but it is no doubt &s;omething in favour of her child."</P>
<P>"I think not." replied his Lord&s;hip, "Such as it is, however, I grant it.&mdash; But in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word &mdash; no farther;&mdash;and one neglect of my com|mands, relea&s;es my promi&s;e totally."</P>
<P>"We will take care, Sir, not to di&s;|obey them."</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">"Then li&s;ten to what they are&mdash;and to you I give the charge of delivering them again.&mdash;Lady Elmwood has peti|tioned me in the name of her father, (a name I reverence) to give his grand|child the &s;anction of my protection.&mdash;In the litteral &s;en&s;e, to &s;uffer her to re&s;ide occa&s;ionally at one of my &s;eats; di&s;pen|&s;ing at the &s;ame time with my ever &s;eeing her."</P>
<P>"And you will comply?"</P>
<P>"I will, till &s;he encroaches on this conce&s;&s;ion, and dare to a&s;k for a greater. &mdash;I will, while &s;he avoids my &s;ight, or the giving me any remembrance of her. &mdash;But whether by de&s;ign or by accident, I ever &s;ee or hear from her; that moment my compliance to her mother's &s;upplica|tion cea&s;es, and I abandon her once more."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">Sandford &s;ighed.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip conti|nued.</P>
<P>"I am glad her reque&s;t &s;topped where it did.&mdash;I would rather comply with her de&s;ires than not; and I rejoice they are &s;uch as I can grant with ea&s;e and honour to my&s;elf. I am &s;eldom now at Elm|wood hou&s;e; let her daughter go there;&mdash; the few weeks or months I am down in the &s;ummer &s;he may ea&s;ily in that exten|&s;ive hou&s;e avoid me&mdash;while &s;he does, &s;he lives in &s;ecurity &mdash; when &s;he does not, you know my re&s;olution."</P>
<P>Sandford bowed &mdash; his Lord&s;hip re|&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Nor can it be a hard&s;hip to obey this command &mdash; &s;he cannot lament the &s;eparation from a parent whom &s;he never knew&mdash;" Sandford was going eagerly to prove the error of that a&s;&s;ertion, but his Lord&s;hip prevented him &s;aying, "In
<PB N="53" REF="54">
a word&mdash;without farther argument&mdash;if &s;he obeys me in this, I certainly provide for her as my daughter during my life, and leave her a fortune at my death&mdash;but if &s;he dares&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sandford interrupted the menace he &s;aw prepared for utterance, &s;aying, "And you &s;till mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, to make Mr. Ru&s;hbrook your heir?"</P>
<P>"Have you not heard me &s;ay &s;o? And do you imagine I have changed my de|termination?

<P>"Then it is yet po&s;&s;ible&mdash;"</P>
<P>"By marrying again, you mean?&mdash; No&mdash;no&mdash; I have had enough of mar|riage
<PB N="54" REF="55">
&mdash; and Henry Ru&s;hbrook I leave my heir. Therefore, Sir&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My Lord, I do not pre&s;ume&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Do not, Sandford, and we may &s;till be friends.&mdash;But I am not to be control|ed as formerly; my temper is changed of late; changed to what it was origi|nally; till your &s;chola&s;tic and religious rules reformed it. You may remember, how trouble&s;ome it was, to conquer my &s;tubborn di&s;po&s;ition in my youth; then, indeed, you did; but in my manhood you will find the ta&s;k more difficult."</P>
<P>Sandford again repeated "He &s;hould not pre&s;ume&mdash;"</P>
<P>To which his Lord&s;hip again made an&s;wer, "Do not, Sandford;" and ad|ded, "For I have a &s;incere regard for you, and &s;hould be loath at the&s;e years to quarrel with you &s;eriou&s;ly."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">Sandford turned away his head to hide his tears.</P>
<P>"Nay, if we do quarrel," re&s;umed his Lord&s;hip, "You know it mu&s;t be your own fault; &mdash;and as this is a theme the mo&s;t likely of any (indeed the only one on which we can have a difference &s;uch as we cannot forgive) take care never from this day to re&s;ume it;&mdash;indeed that of it&s;elf, is an offence I will not par|don.&mdash;I have been clear and explicit in all I have &s;aid; there can be no fear of mi&s;taking my meaning, therefore all fu|ture explanation is unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;nor will I permit a word, or a hint on the &s;ubject from any one, without &s;howing my re&s;ent|ment to the hour of my death." He was going out of the room.</P>
<P>"But before we bid adieu to the &s;ub|ject for ever, my Lord&mdash;there was ano|ther per&s;on whom I named to you&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">"Do you mean Mi&s;s Woodley?&mdash; Oh, by all means let her live at Elm|wood Hou&s;e too. &mdash; On con&s;ideration, I have no objection to &s;ee Mi&s;s Woodley at any time&mdash;I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee her.&mdash; do not let <HI>her</HI> be frightened at me&mdash;to her I &s;hall be the &s;ame, I have always been."</P>
<P>"She is a good woman, my Lord," cried Sandford, plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You need not tell me that, Mr. Sandford; I know her worth."&mdash;And his Lord&s;hip left the room.</P>
<P>Sandford, to relieve Mi&s;s Woodley and her lovely charge from the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which he had left them, &s;et off for their habitation the next day; in order him&s;elf to conduct them from thence to Elmwood Hou&s;e, and ap|point &s;ome retired part of it for Lady Matilda, again&s;t the annual vi&s;it her

father paid there. But before he left London, Giffard, the &s;teward, took an opportunity to wait upon him, and let him know, that his Lord had acquainted him, with the con&s;ent he had given for his daughter to be admitted at Elmwood Ca&s;tle; and upon what re&s;trictions; like|wi&s;e that he had denounced the mo&s;t &s;e|vere threats, &s;hould the&s;e re&s;trictions be broken. Sandford thanked Giffard for his friendly information, which &s;erved him as a &s;econd warning of the circum|&s;pection that was nece&s;&s;ary; and having taken leave of his Lord&s;hip under the pre|tence "he could not live in the &s;moke of London," he &s;et out for the north.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with what de|light Sandford was received by Mi&s;s Woodley, and the haple&s;s daughter of Lady Elmwood, even before he told his
<PB N="58" REF="59">
errand. They both loved him &s;incerely; more e&s;pecially Lady Matilda; who&s;e forlorn &s;tate, and innocent &s;ufferings, had ever excited his compa&s;&s;ion in the extreme&s;t degree, and had cau&s;ed him ever to treat her with the utmo&s;t affec|tion, tenderne&s;s, and re&s;pect. She knew, too, how much he had been her mother's friend; for that &s;he al&s;o loved him; and being honoured with the friend&s;hip of her father, &s;he looked up to him with reverence and awe. For Matilda (with an excellent under&s;tanding, a &s;edate|ne&s;s above her years, and early accu&s;|tomed to the mo&s;t private conver&s;e be|tween Lady Elmwood and Mi&s;s Wood|ley) was perfectly acquainted with the whole fatal hi&s;tory of her mother; and was by her taught, that re&s;pect and ad|miration of her father's virtues which they ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">Notwith&s;tanding the joy of beholding Mr. Sandford, once more to cheer by his pre&s;ence their &s;olitary dwelling; no &s;ooner were the fir&s;t kind greetings over, than the dread of what he might have to inform them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both poor Ma|tilda and Mi&s;s Woodley &s;o powerfully, their gladne&s;s was changed into affright. &mdash;Their apprehen&s;ions were far more for|cible than their curio&s;ity;&mdash;they dur&s;t not a&s;k a que&s;tion, and even began to wi&s;h he would continue &s;ilent upon the &s;ub|ject, on which they feared to li&s;ten.&mdash;For near two hours he was &s;o.&mdash;At length, after a &s;hort interval from &s;peaking, (du|ring which they waited with anxiety for what he might next &s;ay) he turned to Lady Matilda, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You don't a&s;k for your father, my dear."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">"I did not know it was proper." &s;he replied timidly.</P>
<P>"It is always proper," an&s;wered Sandford, "for <HI>you</HI> to think of him, though he &s;hould never think on you."</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into tears, &s;aying, &s;he "<HI>did</HI> think of him, but &s;he felt an apprehen|&s;ion at mentioning his name."&mdash;and &s;he wept bitterly while &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"Nay, do not think I reproved you," &s;aid Sandford; "I but told you what was right."</P>
<P>"Nay, &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "it is not for that &s;he cries thus&mdash;&s;he fears her father has not complied with her mother's reque&s;t.&mdash;Perhaps not even read her let|ter?"</P>
<P>"Yes, he has read it." returned Sandford.</P>
<P>"Oh Heavens!" exclaimed Matilda,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
cla&s;ping her hands together, and the tears falling fa&s;ter &s;till.</P>
<P>"Do not be &s;o much alarmed, my dear," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "you know we are prepared for the wor&s;t; and you know you promi&s;ed your mother, what|ever your fate was, to &s;ubmit with pa|tience."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Matilda, "and I am prepared for every thing, but my fa|ther's refu&s;al to my dear mother."</P>
<P>"Your father has not refu&s;ed your mother's reque&s;t." replied Sandford.</P>
<P>She was leaping from her &s;eat in ec|&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>"But," continued he, "do you know what her reque&s;t was?"</P>
<P>"Not entirely," replied Matilda, "and &s;ince it is granted I am carele&s;s.&mdash; But &s;he told me her letter concerned none but me."</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">To explain perfectly to Matilda Lady Elmwood's letter, and that &s;he might per|fectly under&s;tand upon what terms &s;he was admitted into Elmwood Hou&s;e, Sandford now read the letter to her; and repeated, as nearly as he could remember, the whole of the conver|&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Elm|wood and him&s;elf; not even &s;paring, with an erroneous delicacy, any of tho&s;e threats her father had denounced, &s;hould &s;he dare to break through the limits he pre&s;cribed&mdash;nor did he try to &s;often, in one in&s;tance, a word his Lord&s;hip ut|tered. She li&s;tened &s;ometimes with tears, &s;ometimes with hope, but always with awe, and terror, to every &s;entence wherein her father was concerned. Once &s;he called him cruel&mdash;then exclaimed "he was kind;" but at the end of Sandford's intelligence, concluded &s;he was happy
<PB N="63" REF="64">
and grateful for the boon be&s;towed.&mdash; Even her mother had not a more ex|alted and tran&s;cendent idea of Lord Elm|wood's worth, than his daughter had formed; and this little bounty ju&s;t ob|tained, had not been greater in her mother's e&s;timation, than it was now in her's. &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley, too, &s;miled at the pro&s;pect before her&mdash;&s;he e&s;teemed Lord Elmwood beyond any mortal liv|ing&mdash;&s;he was proud to hear what he had &s;aid in her prai&s;e, and overjoyed at the pro&s;pect &s;he &s;hould be once again in his company; picturing, at the &s;ame time, a thou&s;and of the brighte&s;t hopes, from watching every emotion of his &s;oul, and catching every proper occa&s;ion to excite, or increa&s;e, his paternal &s;entiments.&mdash; Yet &s;he had the prudence to conceal tho&s;e vague hopes from his child, le&s;t a di&s;appointment might prove fatal; and

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on a dark evening in the month of March, that Lady Matilda, accom|panied by Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley, arrived at Elmwood Ca&s;tle, the magni|ficent &s;eat of her father.&mdash;Sandford cho&s;e the evening; rather to &s;teal into the Hou&s;e privately, than by any appearance of parade, &s;uffer Lord Elmwood to be reminded of it by the public prints, or by any other accident.&mdash;Nor would he give the neighbours or &s;ervants the &s;lighte&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, the daughter of their Lord was admitted into his hou&s;e in any other &s;ituation than, that, which &s;he really was.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">As the Porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage that brought them, Matilda felt an awful, and yet a glad&s;ome &s;en&s;ation no terms can de&s;cribe.&mdash;As &s;he entered the door of the hou&s;e this &s;en&s;a|tion increa&s;ed&mdash;and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;pacious hall, the &s;plendid &s;tairca&s;e, and many &s;tately apartments, wonder! With a crowd of the tendere&s;t, yet mo&s;t afflicting, &s;entiments ru&s;hed to her heart. &mdash;She gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment!&mdash;&s;he reflected with more.</P>
<P>"And is <HI>my father</HI> the ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e?" &s;he cried&mdash;"And was my mo|ther once the mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e?"&mdash; Here a flood of tears relieved her from a part of that burthen, which was before in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>"Yes." replied Sandford, "And you are the mi&s;tre&s;s of it now, till your father arrives."</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">"Good God!" exclaimed &s;he, "and will he ever arrive? and &s;hall I live to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with my fa|ther?"</P>
<P>"My dear," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "have not you been told &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "but though I heard it with extreme plea&s;ure, yet the idea never &s;o forcibly affected me as at this moment.&mdash;I now feel, as the reality approaches, this has been kindne&s;s &s;uf|ficient&mdash;I do not a&s;k for more&mdash;I am now convinced, from what this trial makes me feel, that to &s;ee my father, would cau&s;e a &s;en&s;ation, a feeling, I could not &s;urvive."</P>
<P>The next morning gave to Matilda more objects &s;till of admiration and won|der, as &s;he walked over the exten&s;ive gardens, groves, and other plea&s;ure
<PB N="68" REF="69">
grounds belonging to the hou&s;e. She, who had never been beyond the dreary, ruinate place where her decea&s;ed mother had cho&s;en her re&s;idence, was naturally &s;truck with amazement and delight at the grandeur of a &s;eat, which travellers have come for miles to &s;ee, and not thought their time mi&s;pent.</P>
<P>There was one object, however, among all &s;he &s;aw, which attracted her attention above the re&s;t, and &s;he would &s;tand for hours to look at it &mdash;This was a full length portrait of Lord Elmwood, e&s;teemed a very capital picture, and a great likene&s;s&mdash;to this picture &s;he would &s;igh and weep; though when it was fir&s;t pointed out to her, &s;he &s;hrunk back with fear, and it was &s;ome time before &s;he dared venture to ca&s;t her eyes completely upon it. In the features of her father
<PB N="69" REF="70">
&s;he was proud to di&s;cern the exact moulds in which her own appeared to have been modelled; yet Matilda's per&s;on, &s;hape, and complection were &s;o extremely like what her mother's once were, that at the fir&s;t glance &s;he appeared to have a &s;till greater re&s;emblance of her, than of her father&mdash; but her mind and manners were all Lord Elmwood's; &s;oftened by the delicacy of her &s;ex, the extreme tenderne&s;s of her heart, and the melancholy of her &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>She was now in her &s;eventeenth year&mdash;of the &s;ame age, within a year and a few months, of her mother when &s;he became the ward of Dorriforth.&mdash;She was ju&s;t three years old when her father went abroad, and remembered &s;omething of bidding him farewell; but more of taking cher|ries
<PB N="70" REF="71">
from his hand as he pulled them from the tree to give to her.</P>
<P>Educated in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, and inured to retirement from her in|fancy, &s;he had acquired a ta&s;te for all tho&s;e amu&s;ements which a reclu&s;e life affords &mdash; She was fond of walking and riding &mdash; was accompli&s;hed in the arts of mu&s;ic and drawing, by the mo&s;t careful in&s;tructions of her mother &mdash; and as a &s;cholar &s;he excelled mo&s;t of her &s;ex, from the great pains Sandford had taken with that part of her education, and the great abilities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>In devoting certain hours of the day to &s;tudy with him, others to mu&s;ic, riding, and &s;uch recreations, Matilda's time never appeared tedious at Elmwood Hou&s;e, although &s;he neither received
<PB N="71" REF="72">
nor paid one vi&s;it &mdash; for it was &s;oon di|vulged in the neighbourhood upon what &s;tipulation &s;he re&s;ided at her father's, and intimated, that the mo&s;t prudent and friendly behaviour of the friends both of her father and of her&s;elf, would be, to take no notice whatever that &s;he lived among them: and as Lord Elmwood's will was a law all around, &s;uch was the con&s;equence, of his will being known or &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Neither did Mi&s;s Woodley regret the want of vi&s;iters, but found her&s;elf far more &s;atisfied in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, than her mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could have formed &mdash; She had a companion whom &s;he loved with an equal fondne&s;s, with which &s;he had loved her decea&s;ed mo|ther; and frequently in this charming man&s;ion, where &s;he had &s;o often beheld
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Lady Elmwood, her imagination pic|tured Matilda as her ri&s;en from the grave in her former youth, health, and exqui|&s;ite beauty.</P>
<P>In peace, in content, though far from happine&s;s, the days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed away till about the middle of Augu&s;t, when preparations began to be made for the arrival of Lord Elmwood. &mdash; The week in which he was to come was at length fixed, and &s;ome part of his reti|nue was arrived before him.&mdash;When this was told to Matilda &s;he &s;tarted, and looked ju&s;t as her mother at her age of|ten times had done, when, in &s;pite of her love, &s;he was con&s;cious &s;he had of|fended him, and was terrified at his ap|proach. Sandford ob&s;erving this, put out his hand, and taking hers &s;hook it kindly; and bade her (but it was not in
<PB N="73" REF="74">
a cheerful tone) "not be afraid." This gave her no confidence; and &s;he began, before his Lord&s;hip's arrival, to &s;eclude her&s;elf in tho&s;e apartments which were allotted for her during the time of his &s;tay; and in the timorous expectation of his coming, her appetite declined and &s;he lo&s;t all her colour. &mdash; Even Mi&s;s Woodley, who&s;e &s;pirits had been for &s;ome time elated with the hopes &s;he had formed, on drawing near to the te&s;t, found tho&s;e hopes vani&s;hed; and though &s;he endeavoured to conceal it, &s;he was replete with apprehen&s;ions. &mdash; Sandford, had certainly fewer fears an either; yet upon the eve of the day on which his patron was to arrive, he was evidently ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>Lady Matilda once a&s;ked him &mdash; "Are you certain, Mr. Sandford, you made no mi&s;take in re&s;pect to what Lord Elmwood &s;aid, when he granted my
<PB N="74" REF="75">
mother's reque&s;t? Are you &s;ure he <HI>did</HI> grant it?&mdash;Was there nothing equivocal on which he may ground his di&s;plea&s;ure &s;hould he hear I am here?&mdash;Oh! do not let me hazard the being once again turn|ed out of his hou&s;e!&mdash;Oh! &s;ave me from provoking him perhaps to cur&s;e me."&mdash; And here &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together with the mo&s;t fervent petition, in the dread of what might happen.</P>
<P>"If you doubt my word or my &s;en&s;es," &s;aid Sandford, "call Giffard, and let him inform you;&mdash;my Lord repeated the &s;ame words to him he did to me."</P>
<P>Though from her rea&s;on Matilda could not doubt of any mi&s;take from Mr. Sand|ford, yet her fears &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and &s;cruples; and this reference to the &s;tew|ard &s;he received with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfac|tion, (though &s;he did not think it nece&s;|&s;ary to apply to him) as it perfectly con|vinced
<PB N="75" REF="76">
her of the folly of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;he had entertained.</P>
<P>"And yet, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid &s;he, "if it is &s;o, why are you le&s;s cheerful than you were? I cannot help thinking but it mu&s;t be the expectation of Lord Elmwood, which has cau&s;ed in you this change."</P>
<P>"I don't know;" replied Sandford, carele&s;&s;ly, "but I believe I am grown afraid of your father.&mdash;His temper is a great deal altered from what it once was&mdash; he exalts his voice, and u&s;es har&s;h ex|pre&s;&s;ions upon the lea&s;t provocation&mdash;his eyes fla&s;h lightning, and his face is di&s;|torted with anger on the &s;lighte&s;t motives &mdash; he turns away his old &s;ervants at a moment's warning, and no conce&s;&s;ion can make their peace.&mdash;In a word, I am more at my ea&s;e when I am away from him &mdash; and I really believe," added he
<PB N="76" REF="77">
with a &s;mile, but with a tear at the &s;ame time, "I really believe I am more afraid of him in my age, than he was of me when he was a boy."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was pre&s;ent; &s;he and Matilda looked at one another; and each &s;aw the other turn pale, at this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The day at length came on which Lord Elmwood was expected to dinner. &mdash;It had been a high gratification to his daughter to have gone to the top|mo&s;t window of the hou&s;e, to have only beheld his chariot enter the avenue; but it was a gratification which her fears, her tremor, her extreme &s;en&s;ibility would not permit her to enjoy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he &s;at down that day to dinner in their retired apartments; which were detached from the other part
<PB N="77" REF="78">
of the hou&s;e by a gallery; and of the door leading to the gallery they had a key to impede any one from pa&s;&s;ing that way, without fir&s;t ringing a bell; to an|&s;wer which, was the &s;ole employment of a &s;ervant who was placed there during his Lord&s;hip's re&s;idence, le&s;t by any acci|dent he might chance to come near that unfrequented part of the hou&s;e; on which occa&s;ion the man was to give immediate notice to his Lady.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he &s;at down to dinner, but did not dine.&mdash;Sandford ate, as u&s;ual, with Lord Elmwood. &mdash;When the &s;ervant brought up tea, Mi&s;s Wood|ley a&s;ked him if he had &s;een his Lord&mdash; The man an&s;wered, "Yes, Madam; and he looks va&s;tly well." &mdash; Matilda wept with joy to hear it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">About nine in the evening Sandford rung at the bell, and was admitted&mdash;and never was he &s;o welcome&mdash;Matilda hung upon him, as if his recent &s;ociety with her father had endeared him to her more than ever; and &s;taring anxiou&s;ly in his face, &s;eemed to a&s;k him to tell her &s;ome|thing of Lord Elmwood, and &s;omething that &s;hould not alarm her.</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;how do you find your&s;elf?" &s;aid he to her.</P>
<P>"How are you, Mr. Sandford?" &s;he returned, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Oh! very well." replied he.</P>
<P>"Is my Lord in a good temper?" a&s;ked Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Yes; very well." replied Sandford, with indifference.</P>
<P>"Did he &s;eem glad to &s;ee you?" a&s;ked Matilda.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">"He &s;hook me by the hand." replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"That was a &s;ign he was glad to &s;ee you, was it not?" &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>"Yes; but he could not do le&s;s."</P>
<P>"Nor more." replied &s;he.</P>
<P>"He looks very well, our &s;ervant tells us." &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Extremely well indeed," an&s;wered Sandford: "and, to tell the truth, I never &s;aw him in better &s;pirits."</P>
<P>"That is well:" &s;aid Matilda, and &s;ighed a weight of fears from her heart.</P>
<P>"Where is he now, Mr. Sandford?"</P>
<P>"Gone to take a walk about his grounds, and &s;o I &s;tole here the time."</P>
<P>"What was your conver&s;ation during dinner?"</P>
<P>"Hor&s;es, hay, farming, and politics."</P>
<P>"Won't you &s;up with him?"</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">"I &s;hall &s;ee him again before I go to bed."</P>
<P>"And again to-morrow!" &mdash; cried Matilda, "what happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"He has vi&s;iters to-morrow," &s;aid Sandford, "coming for a week or two."</P>
<P>"Thank heaven!" &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "he will then be diverted from thinking on us."</P>
<P>"Do you know," returned Sandford, "it is my firm opinion, that his think|ing of ye at pre&s;ent, is the cau&s;e of his good &s;pirits."</P>
<P>"Oh, heavens!" cried Matilda, lift|ing up her hands with rapture.</P>
<P>"Nay, do not mi&s;take me;" &s;aid Sandford; "I would not have you build a foundation for joy upon this; for if he is in &s;pirits that you are in this hou&s;e&mdash; &s;o near him&mdash;po&s;itively under his protec|tion &mdash; yet he will not allow him&s;elf to
<PB N="81" REF="82">
think that, is the cau&s;e of his content&mdash; and the &s;entiments he has adopted, and are now become natural to him, will re|main the &s;ame as ever; nay, perhaps with greater force, while he &s;u&s;pects his weakne&s;s (as he calls it) acting in oppo|&s;ition."</P>
<P>"If he does but think of me with tenderne&s;s," cried Matilda, "I am re|compen&s;ed."</P>
<P>"And what recompen&s;e would his kind thoughts be to you," &s;aid Sandford, "were he to turn you out to beggary?"</P>
<P>"A great deal &mdash; a great deal." &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"But how are you to know he has the&s;e kind thoughts, while he gives you no proof of them?"</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Sandford; but <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> we could know them without the proof."</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83">"But as that is impo&s;&s;ible," an&s;wered he, "I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, till the proof ap|pears, I am mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>Matilda looked deeply concerned that the argument &s;hould conclude in her di&s;appointment; for to have believed her&s;elf thought of with tenderne&s;s by her father, would have alone con&s;tituted her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant came up with &s;ome|thing by way of &s;upper, he told Mr. Sandford his Lord&s;hip was returned from his walk and had enquired for him; Sand|ford immediately bade his companions good night, and left them.</P>
<P>"How &s;trange is this!" cried Matil|da, when Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were alone, "My father within a few rooms of me, and yet I am debarred from &s;ee|ing him!&mdash;Only by walking a few paces
<PB N="83" REF="84">
I might be at his feet, and perhaps re|ceive his ble&s;&s;ing."</P>
<P>"You make me &s;hudder," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "but &s;ome &s;pirits le&s;s fear|ful than mine, might perhaps advi&s;e you to try the experiment."</P>
<P>"Not for worlds," returned Matilda; "no coun&s;el could tempt me to &s;uch temerity; and yet to entertain the thought, that it is po&s;&s;ible I could do this, is a &s;ource of great comfort."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation la&s;ted till bed time, and later; for they &s;at up beyond their u&s;ual hour to indulge it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley &s;lept little, but Matilda le&s;s &mdash; &s;he awaked repeatedly during the night, and every time &s;ighed to her&s;elf, "I &s;leep in the &s;ame hou&s;e with my fa|ther! Ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of my mother, look down and rejoice."</P>

<P>THE next day the whole Ca&s;tle ap|peared to Lady Matilda (though &s;he was in &s;ome degree retired from it) all tumult and bu&s;tle; as was u&s;ually the ca&s;e while his Lord&s;hip was there. She &s;aw from her windows &s;ervants run|ning acro&s;s the yards and park, hor&s;es and carriages driving with fury, all the &s;uit of a nobleman; and it &s;eemed &s;ome|times to elate, at other times to depre&s;s her.</P>
<P>The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions however, and others of fear and anxiety, which her father's fir&s;t arrival had excited, by degrees wore away; and after &s;ome &s;hort time, &s;he
<PB N="85" REF="86">
was in the &s;ame tranquil &s;tate &s;he enjoyed before he came.</P>
<P>He had vi&s;itors, to &s;tay a week or two; he paid &s;ome vi&s;its him&s;elf for &s;everal days; and thus the time pa&s;&s;ed, till it was about four weeks &s;ince he ar|rived; during which, Sandford, with all his penetration, could never clearly di&s;|cover whether he had once called to mind his daughter was living in the &s;ame hou&s;e. He had not named her (that was not extraordinary) con&s;equently no one dur&s;t name her to him; but he had not even mentioned Mi&s;s Woodley, of whom he had &s;o lately &s;poken in the kinde&s;t terms, and &s;aid, "He &s;hould take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing her again." From the&s;e contra|dictions in Lord Elmwood's behaviour in re&s;pect to her, it was Mi&s;s Woodley's plan neither to throw her&s;elf in his way,
<PB N="86" REF="87">
or avoid him. She therefore frequently walked about the hou&s;e while he was in it, not indeed wholly without re|&s;traint, but at lea&s;t with the &s;how of li|berty. This freedom, indulged for &s;ome time without peril, became at la&s;t le&s;s cautious; and no ill con&s;equences ari&s;ing from its practice, her &s;cruples gradually cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>One morning, however, as &s;he was cro&s;&s;ing the large hall, thoughtle&s;s of danger, a foot&s;tep at a di&s;tance alarmed her almo&s;t without knowing why&mdash;She &s;topped for a moment, thinking to re|turn; the &s;teps approached quicker, and before &s;he could retreat &s;he beheld Lord Elmwood at the other end of the hall, and perceived that he &s;aw her. &mdash; It was now too late to he&s;itate what was to be done; &s;he could not go back, and had
<PB N="87" REF="88">
not courage to go on; &s;he therefore &s;tood &s;till.&mdash;Di&s;concerted, and much affected at his &s;ight, (their former intimacy com|ing to her mind, together with the many years, and many &s;ad occurrences pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince &s;he la&s;t &s;aw him) all her intentions, all her meditated plans how to conduct her&s;elf on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, gave way to a &s;udden &s;hock&mdash;and to make the meet|ing yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, her very fright &s;he knew mu&s;t &s;erve to recall more pow|erfully to his mind, the &s;ubject &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed him to forget. The &s;teward was with his Lord&s;hip, and as they came up clo&s;e by her &s;ide, Giffard ob&s;erving him look at her earne&s;tly, &s;aid &s;oftly, but &s;o as &s;he heard him, "My Lord, it is Mi&s;s Woodley." Lord Elmwood's hat was off immediately, and coming to her with alacrity, he took her by the hand and &s;aid, "Indeed, Mi&s;s Woodley, I did not
<PB N="88" REF="89">
know you&mdash;I am very glad to &s;ee you." and while he &s;poke, &s;hook her hand with a cordiality her tender heart could not bear &mdash; and never did &s;he feel &s;o hard a &s;truggle as to re&s;train her tears. But the thought of Matilda's fate&mdash;the idea of awaking in his mind a &s;entiment that might irritate him again&s;t his child, wrought more forcibly than every other effort; and though &s;he could not reply di&s;tinctly, &s;he replied without weeping.&mdash; Whether he &s;aw her embarra&s;&s;ment, and wi&s;hed to relea&s;e her from it, or was in ha&s;te to conceal his own; he left her al|mo&s;t in&s;tantly; but not till he had en|treated &s;he would dine that very day with him and Mr. Sandford, who were to dine without other company.&mdash;She curt|&s;ied a&s;&s;ent, and flew to tell Matilda what had occurred.&mdash;After li&s;tening with anx|iety and joy to all &s;he told, Matilda laid
<PB N="89" REF="90">
hold of that hand &s;he &s;aid Lord Elm|wood had held, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips with love and reverence.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Woodley made her ap|pearance at dinner, Sandford, (who had not &s;een her &s;ince the invitation, and did not know of it) looked amazed!&mdash; on which his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, "Do you know, Sandford, I met Mi&s;s Woodley this morning, and had it not been for Giffard I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed her without knowing her &mdash; but Mi&s;s Woodley, if I am not &s;o much altered but that you knew me, I take it unkind you did not &s;peak fir&s;t."&mdash;She was unable to &s;peak even now &mdash; he &s;aw it, and changed the conver&s;ation; which Sandford was happy to join, for in the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e he did not feel him&s;elf very comfortable.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">As they advanced in their dinner, Mi&s;s Woodley's and Sandford's embar|ra&s;&s;ment dimini&s;hed; while Lord Elm|wood in his turn became, not embarra&s;|&s;ed, but ab&s;ent and melancholy. &mdash; He now and then &s;ighed heavily&mdash;and called for wine much oftener than he was ac|cu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Woodley took her leave, his Lord&s;hip invited her to dine with him and Sandford whenever it was con|venient to her;&mdash;he &s;aid many things, too, of the &s;ame kind, and all with the utmo&s;t civility, yet not with that warmth with which he had &s;poken in the morn|ing &mdash; into that he had been &s;urpri&s;ed, while this coolne&s;s was the effect of re|flection.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">When &s;he came to Lady Matilda, and Sandford had joined them, they talked and deliberated on what had pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>"You acknowledge, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that you think my pre&s;ence affected Lord Elmwood &s;o as to make him much more thoughtful than u&s;ual; if you imagine the&s;e thoughts were upon Lady Elmwood, I will ne|ver intrude again; but if you &s;uppo&s;e I cau&s;ed him to think upon his daughter, I cannot go too often."</P>
<P>"I don't &s;ee how he can divide tho&s;e two objects in his mind," replied Sand|ford, "and therefore you mu&s;t e'en vi&s;it him on, and take your chance, what reflections you may in&s;pire&mdash;but, be they what they will, time, will take away from you that power of affecting him."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Lord Elmwood had been at his country &s;eat about &s;ix weeks, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, his nephew, and his adopted child, the friendle&s;s boy whom poor Lady Elmwood fir&s;t introduced in|to his uncle's hou&s;e, and by her kind|ne&s;s pre&s;erved there&mdash;arrived from his travels, and was received by his Lord|&s;hip with all that affectionate warmth due to the man he thought worthy to make his heir. Ru&s;hbrook had been a beautiful boy, and was now an extremely hand&s;ome young man; he had made an unu&s;ual progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, had com|pleted the tour of Italy and Germany, and returned home with the air and addre&s;s of
<PB N="94" REF="95">
a perfect man of fa&s;hion&mdash;there was, be|&s;ide, an elegance and per&s;ua&s;ion in his manner almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.&mdash;Yet with all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, when he was in|troduced to Sandford, and put out his hand to take his, Sandford, with evi|dent reluctance, gave it to him; and when Lord Elmwood a&s;ked him, in the young man's pre&s;ence, "if he did not think his nephew greatly improved?" He looked at him from head to foot, and muttered "he could not &s;ay he ob|&s;erved it." The colour heightened in Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's face upon this occa&s;ion, but he was too well bred not to be &s;till in perfect good humour.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;aw this young man treated in the hou&s;e of Lord Elmwood with the &s;ame re&s;pect and attention as if he had been his Lord&s;hip's &s;on; and it was but
<PB N="95" REF="96">
probable the old prie&s;t &s;hould make a compari&s;on between the &s;ituation of him, and of Lady Matilda Elmwood.&mdash;Before her, it was Sandford's meaning to have concealed his thoughts upon the &s;ubject, and never to have mentioned it but with compo&s;ure; that was, however, impo&s;|&s;ible &mdash; unu&s;ed to conceal his feelings; at the name of Ru&s;hbrook his counte|nance would always change, and a &s;ar|ca&s;tic &s;neer, and &s;ometimes a frown of re&s;entment, force their way in &s;pite of his re&s;olution. &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley, too, with all her boundle&s;s charity and good will, was, upon this occa&s;ion, induced to limit their exce&s;s; and they did not extend &s;o far as to reach poor Ru&s;h|brook &mdash; She even, and in <HI>reality,</HI> did not think him hand&s;ome or engaging in his manners&mdash;&s;he thought his gaiety fri|vilou&s;ne&s;s, his complai&s;ance affectation,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
and his good humour impertinence.&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal tho&s;e unfavour|able &s;entiments entirely from Matilda; for when the &s;ubject aro&s;e, as it frequently did, Mi&s;s Woodley's undi&s;gui&s;ed heart, and Sandford's undi&s;gui&s;ed countenance, told them in&s;tantly.&mdash;Matilda had the under&s;tanding to imagine, &s;he was, per|haps, the object who had thus deformed Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, and frequently (though he was a &s;tranger to her, and one who had cau&s;ed her many a jealous heartach) fre|quently &s;he would &s;peak in his vindication.</P>
<P>"You are very good," &s;aid Sandford one day to her; "you like him becau&s;e you know your father loves him."</P>
<P>This was a hard &s;entence to the daugh|ter of Lord Elmwood, to whom her father's love would have been more pre|cious than any other ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;She, how|ever, checked the a&s;&s;ault of envy, and kindly replied,</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">"My mother loved him, too, Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered Sandford, "he has been a grateful man to your poor mo|ther&mdash;She did not &s;uppo&s;e when &s;he took him into the hou&s;e, when &s;he intreated your father to take him, and through her care&s;&s;es and officious prai&s;es of him to his uncle, fir&s;t gave him that power he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over him; &s;he little fore&s;aw, at that time, his ingratitude, and its effects."</P>
<P>"Very true." &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, with a heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>"What ingratitude?" &s;aid Matilda; "do you &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Ru&s;hbrook is the cau&s;e my father will not &s;ee me? Oh do not pay Lord Elmwood's motives &s;o ill a compliment."</P>
<P>"I do not &s;ay he is the ab&s;olute cau&s;e," returned Sandford; "but if a
<PB N="98" REF="99">
parent's heart is void, I would have it remain &s;o, till &s;tored by its lawful owner&mdash; a u&s;urper I dete&s;t."</P>
<P>"No one can take Lord Elmwood's heart by force," replied his daughter, "it mu&s;t, I believe, be a free gift to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and as &s;uch, whoever has it, has a right to it."</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he would plead the young man's excu&s;e&mdash;perhaps but to hear what could be &s;aid in his disfavour, for &s;ecretly his name was bitter to her&mdash; and once &s;he exclaimed in vexation, on Sandford's &s;aying Lord Elmwood and Mr. Ru&s;hbrook were gone out &s;hooting together,</P>
<P>"All that plea&s;ure is now eclip&s;ed which I u&s;ed to take in li&s;tening to the report of my father's gun, for I cannot now di&s;tingui&s;h his, from his para&s;ite's."</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">Sandford, much as he di&s;liked Ru&s;h|brook&mdash;for this expre&s;&s;ion which com|pri&s;ed her father in the reflection, turned to Matilda in extreme anger; but as he &s;aw the colour mount to her face, for what, in the &s;trong feelings of her heart, had e&s;caped her lips, he did not &s;ay a word&mdash;and by a flood of tears that fol|lowed after, he rejoiced to &s;ee how much &s;he reproved her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, vext to the heart, and provoked every time &s;he &s;aw Lord Elmwood and Ru&s;hbrook together, and &s;aw the familiar terms on which this young man lived with his benefactor, now made her vi&s;its to his Lord&s;hip very &s;eldom.&mdash;If Lord Elmwood ob&s;erved this, he did not appear to ob&s;erve it; and though he received her very politely when &s;he did pay him a vi&s;it, it was al|ways
<PB N="100" REF="101">
very coldly; nor did &s;he &s;uppo&s;e if &s;he never went, he would ever a&s;k for her. For his daughter's &s;ake, how|ever, &s;he thought it right &s;ometimes to &s;how her&s;elf before him; for &s;he knew it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible that, with all his &s;eeming indifference, Lord Elmwood could ever &s;ee her without thinking for a moment on his child; and what one fortunate thought might &s;ometime bring about, was an object too &s;erious for her to &s;light.&mdash;She therefore, after remaining confined to her apartments near three weeks, (excepting tho&s;e &s;hort and anxi|ous walks &s;he and Matilda &s;tole, while Lord Elmwood dined, or before he ro&s;e in a morning) went one forenoon into his Lord&s;hip's apartments, where as u&s;ual, &s;he found him, Mr. Sandford, and Mr. Ru&s;hbrook.&mdash;After &s;he had &s;at about half an hour, conver&s;ing with
<PB N="101" REF="102">
them all, though but very little with the latter, his Lord&s;hip was called out of the room upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; pre|&s;ently after Sandford; and now, not much plea&s;ed with the companion with whom &s;he was left, &s;he ro&s;e and was going likewi&s;e, when Ru&s;hbrook fixed his &s;peaking eyes upon her, and cried,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley, will you pardon me what I am going to &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"Certainly, Sir&mdash;You can, I am &s;ure, &s;ay nothing but what I mu&s;t forgive."&mdash; But &s;he made this reply with a di&s;tance and a re&s;erve, very unlike the u&s;ual man|ners of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>He looked at her earne&s;tly and cried, "Ah! Mi&s;s Woodley, you don't be|have &s;o kindly to me as you u&s;ed to do!"</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand you, Sir," &mdash; &s;he replied, very gravely;&mdash;"Times are
<PB N="102" REF="103">
changed, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, &s;ince you were la&s;t here &mdash; you were then but a child."</P>
<P>"Yet I love all tho&s;e per&s;ons now, I loved then;" replied he; "and &s;o I &s;hall for ever."</P>
<P>"But you mi&s;take, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook; I was not even then &s;o very much the object of your affections &mdash; there were other ladies you loved better.&mdash;Perhaps you don't remember Lady Elmwood?"</P>
<P>"Don't I?"&mdash;cried he, "Oh!" (cla&s;p|ing his hands and lifting up his eyes to heaven) "&s;hall I ever forget her?"</P>
<P>That moment Lord Elmwood opened the door; the conver&s;ation of cour&s;e that moment ended; but confu&s;ion at the &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e was on the face of both the parties &mdash; his Lord&s;hip &s;aw it,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
and looked at each by turns, with a &s;ternne&s;s that made poor Mi&s;s Woodley ready to faint; while Ru&s;hbrook, with the mo&s;t natural and happy laugh that ever was affected, cried, "No, don't tell my Lord, pray, Mi&s;s Woodley."&mdash; She was more confu&s;ed than before; and his Lord&s;hip turning to him, a&s;ked what the &s;ubject was.&mdash;By this time he had invented one, and continuing his laugh, &s;aid, "Mi&s;s Woodley, my Lord, will to this day prote&s;t &s;he &s;aw my apparition when I was a boy; and &s;he &s;ays it is a &s;ign I &s;hall die young, and is really much affected at it."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood turned away before this ridiculous &s;peech was concluded; yet &s;o well had it been acted, he did not for an in&s;tant doubt its truth.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley felt her&s;elf greatly re|lieved;
<PB N="104" REF="105">
and yet &s;o little is it in the power of tho&s;e we di&s;like to do any thing to plea&s;e us, that from this very circum|&s;tance, &s;he formed a &s;till more unfavour|able opinion of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook than &s;he had done before. &mdash; She &s;aw in this little incident the art of di&s;&s;imulation, cun|ning, and duplicity in its mo&s;t glaring &s;hape; and dete&s;ted the method by which they had each e&s;caped Lord Elmwood's &s;u&s;picion, and perhaps anger, the more, becau&s;e it was &s;o dexterou&s;ly managed.</P>
<P>Lady Matilda and Sandford were both in their turns informed of this trait in Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's character; and al|though Mi&s;s Woodley had the be&s;t of di&s;|po&s;itions, and upon every occa&s;ion &s;poke the &s;tricte&s;t truth, yet in relating this occurrence, &s;he did not &s;peak all the truth; for every circum&s;tance that would
<PB N="105" REF="106">
have told to the young man's advantage, <HI>literally</HI> &s;lipped her memory.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth of October arrived; on which a dinner, a ball, and &s;upper, was given by Lord Elmwood to all the neighbouring gentry &mdash; the pea&s;ants al&s;o dined in the park off a roa&s;ted bullock; &s;everal ca&s;ks of ale were di&s;tributed, and the bells of the village rung. &mdash; Matilda, who heard and &s;aw &s;ome part of this fe&s;|tivity from her windows, inquired the cau&s;e; but even the &s;ervant who waited upon her had too much &s;en&s;ibility to tell her, and an&s;wered, "he did not know." Mi&s;s Woodley however &s;oon learnt the rea&s;on, and groaning with the painful &s;ecret, informed her, "Mr. Ru&s;hbrook on that day was come of age."</P>
<P>"My birth day was la&s;t week." re|plied Matilda; but not a word be&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107">In their retired apartments, the day pa&s;&s;ed away not only &s;oberly, but almo&s;t &s;ilently; for to &s;peak upon any &s;ubject that did not engage their thoughts had been difficult, and to &s;peak upon the only one that did, had been afflictive.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they were &s;itting down to din|ner their bell gently rung, and in walked Sandford.</P>
<P>"Why are not you among the revel|lers, Mr. Sandford?" cried Mi&s;s Wood|ley, with an ironical &s;neer&mdash;(the fir&s;t her features ever wore) &mdash;"Pray, were not you invited to dine with the company?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Sandford; "but my head aked; and &s;o I had rather come and take a bit with you."</P>
<P>Matilda, as if &s;he had beheld his heart as he &s;poke, clung round his neck and &s;obbed on his bo&s;om: he put her

peevi&s;hly away, crying, "Non&s;en&s;e, non&s;en&s;e&mdash;eat your dinner." But he did not eat him&s;elf.</P>

<P>ABOUT a week after this, Lord Elm|wood went out two days for a vi&s;it; con|&s;equently Ru&s;hbrook was for that time ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. The fir&s;t morning he went a &s;hooting, and returning about noon, enquired of Sandford, who was &s;itting in the room, if he had taken up a volume of plays left upon the table.&mdash; "I read no &s;uch things." replied Sand|ford, and quitted the room abruptly. Ru&s;hbrook then rung for his &s;ervant, and de&s;ired him to look for the book, a&s;king him angrily, "Who had been in the apartment? for he was &s;ure he had left it there when he went out."&mdash;The &s;ervant withdrew to enquire, and pre&s;ently re|turned
<PB N="109" REF="110">
with the volume in his hand, and "Mi&s;s Woodley's compliments, &s;he begs your pardon, Sir, &s;he did not know the book was yours, and hopes you will excu&s;e the liberty &s;he took."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley!" cried Ru&s;hbrook with &s;urprize, "&s;he comes &s;o &s;eldom in|to the&s;e apartments, I did not &s;uppo&s;e it was her who had it &mdash; take it back to her in&s;tantly, with my re&s;pects, and I beg &s;he will keep it."</P>
<P>The man went; but returned with the book again, and laying it on the table without &s;peaking, was going away; when Ru&s;hbrook, hurt at receiving no &s;econd me&s;&s;age, &s;aid, "I am afraid, Sir, you did very wrong in taking this book from Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>"It was not from her I took it, Sir," replied the man, "it was from Lady Matilda."</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">Since he had entered the hou&s;e, Ru&s;h|brook had never before heard her name&mdash; he was &s;hocked&mdash;confounded more than ever&mdash;and to conceal what he felt, in|&s;tantly ordered the man out of the room.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mi&s;s Woodley and Matilda were talking over this trifling occurrence; and frivolous as it was, drew from it &s;trong conclu&s;ions of Ru&s;h|brook's in&s;olence and power.&mdash;In &s;pite of her pride, the daughter of Lord Elm|wood even wept at the in&s;ult &s;he had received on this in&s;ignificant occa&s;ion; for the volume being merely taken from her at Mr. Ru&s;hbrook's command, &s;he felt an in&s;ult; and the manner in which it was done by the &s;ervant, might contribute to the offence.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">While Mi&s;s Woodley and &s;he were upon this conver&s;ation, a note came from Ru&s;hbrook to Mi&s;s Woodley, wherein he entreated he might be permitted to &s;ee her.&mdash;She &s;ent a verbal an&s;wer, "She was engaged." He &s;ent again, begging &s;he would name her own time. But certain of a &s;econd denial, he followed the &s;ervant who took the la&s;t me&s;&s;age, and as Mi&s;s Woodley came out of her apartment into the gallery to &s;peak to him, Ru&s;hbrook pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and told the man to retire.</P>
<P>"Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "this intru&s;ion is in&s;upportable;&mdash; and de&s;titute as you may think me of the friend&s;hip of Lord Elmwood"&mdash;</P>
<P>In the ardour with which Ru&s;hbrook was waiting to expre&s;s him&s;elf, he inter|rupted her, and caught hold of her hand.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">She immediately &s;natched it from him; and withdrew into her chamber.</P>
<P>He followed, &s;aying in a low voice, "Dear Mi&s;s Woodley hear me."</P>
<P>At that juncture Lady Matilda, who was in an inner room, came out of it in|to Mi&s;s Woodley's.&mdash;Perceiving a gen|tleman, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort at the door.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook ca&s;t his eyes upon her, and &s;tood motionle&s;s &mdash; his lips only moved. "Do not dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, Madam," &s;aid he, "without hearing my apology for being here."</P>
<P>Though Matilda had never &s;een him &s;ince her infancy, there was no cau&s;e to tell her who it was that addre&s;&s;ed her&mdash; his elegant and youthful per&s;on, joined to the incident which had ju&s;t occurred, convinced her it was Ru&s;hbrook; and &s;he looked at him with an air of &s;urpri&s;e, but with &s;till more, of dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">"Mi&s;s Woodley is &s;evere upon me, Madam," continued he, "&s;he judges me unkindly; and I am afraid &s;he will prepo&s;&s;e&s;s you with the &s;ame unfavour|able &s;entiments."</P>
<P>Still Matilda did not &s;peak, but look|ed at him with the &s;ame air of dig|nity.</P>
<P>"If, Lady Matilda," re&s;umed he, "I have offended you, and mu&s;t quit you without pardon, I am more unhappy than I &s;hould be with the lo&s;s of your father's protection &mdash; more forlorn, than when an orphan boy, your mother fir&s;t took pity on me."</P>
<P>At this la&s;t &s;entence, Matilda turned her eyes on Mi&s;s Woodley, and &s;eemed in doubt what reply &s;he was to give.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook immediately fell upon his knees &mdash; "Oh! Lady Matilda," cried he, "if you knew the &s;en&s;ations of my
<PB N="114" REF="115">
heart, you would not treat me with this di&s;dain."</P>
<P>"We can only judge of tho&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "by the effect they have upon your conduct; and while you in&s;ult Lord and Lady Elmwood's daughter by an intru|&s;ion like this, and then ridicule her abect &s;tate by mockery, &s;uch as the pre&s;ent"&mdash;</P>
<P>He flew from his knees in&s;tantly, and interrupted her, crying "What can I do? &mdash; What am I to &s;ay, to make you change your opinion of me? &mdash; While Lord Elmwood has been at home I have kept at an awful di&s;tance; and though every moment I breathed was a wi&s;h to ca&s;t my&s;elf at his daughter's feet, yet as I feared, Mi&s;s Woodley, you were in|cen&s;ed again&s;t me, by what means was I to procure an interview but by &s;trata|gem
<PB N="115" REF="116">
or force?&mdash;This accident has given a third method, and I had not &s;trength, I had not courage, to let it pa&s;s.&mdash;Lord Elmwood will &s;oon return, and we may both be hurried to town immediately;&mdash; then how for a tedious winter could I &s;u&s;tain the thought that I was de&s;pi&s;ed, nay perhaps con&s;idered as an object of ingratitude, by the only child of my decea&s;ed benefactre&s;s."</P>
<P>Matilda replied with all her father's haughtine&s;s, "Depend upon it, Sir, if you &s;hould ever enter my thoughts, it will only be as an object of envy."</P>
<P>"Suffer me then, Madam," &s;aid he, "as an earne&s;t you do not think wor&s;e of me than I merit, &s;uffer me to be &s;ometimes admitted into your pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>She &s;carcely permitted him to fini&s;h the period, before &s;he replied, "This is the la&s;t time, Sir, we &s;hall ever meet, de|pend
<PB N="116" REF="117">
upon it &mdash; unle&s;s, indeed, Lord Elmwood &s;hould delegate to you the control of me &mdash; his commands I never di&s;pute." And here &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook walked to the window, and did not &s;peak for a &s;hort time&mdash;then turning him&s;elf to make a reply, both Matilda and Mi&s;s Woodley were &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, he had &s;hed tears too.&mdash;Having conquered them, he &s;aid, "I will not offend you, Madam, by &s;taying one moment longer; and I give my honour, that, upon no pretence what|ever, will I pre&s;ume to intrude here again. &mdash; Profe&s;&s;ions, I find, have no weight, and only by this obedience to your orders can I give a proof of that re&s;pect which you in&s;pire;&mdash;and let the agitation I now feel, convince you, Lady Matilda, that, with all my &s;eeming good
<PB N="117" REF="118">
fortune, I am not happier than your&s;elf."&mdash; And &s;o much was he agitated while he delivered this, it was with difficulty he came to the conclu&s;ion.&mdash;When he did, he bowed with reverence, as if he had left the pre&s;ence of a deity, and went away.</P>
<P>Matilda immediately entered the chamber &s;he had come from, and with|out ca&s;ting a &s;ingle look at Mi&s;s Wood|ley, by which &s;he might gue&s;s of the opinion &s;he had formed of Mr. Ru&s;h|brook's conduct. &mdash; The next time they met they did not even mention his name; for they were a&s;hamed to own any par|tiality in his favour, and were too ju&s;t to bring any &s;erious accu&s;ation again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Woodley the day following communicated the intelligence of this
<PB N="118" REF="119">
vi&s;it to Mr. Sandford, who not being pre&s;ent, and a witne&s;s of tho&s;e marks of humility and re&s;pect which were con&s;pi|cuous in the deportment of Mr. Ru&s;h|brook, was highly offended at his pre|&s;umption; and threatened if he ever dared to force his company there again, he would acquaint Lord Elmwood with his arrogance, whatever might be the event.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley however, a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he believed he would have no cau&s;e for &s;uch a complaint, as the young man had made the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e never to commit the like offence; and &s;he thought it her duty to enjoin Sand|ford, till he did repeat it, not to men|tion the circum&s;tance, even to Ru&s;h|brook him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Matilda could not but feel a regard towards her father's heir in return for
<PB N="119" REF="120">
that which he had &s;o fervently declared for her; yet the more favourable her opinion of his mind and manners, the more he be|came a proper object of her jealou&s;y for the affections of Lord Elmwood, and was now con&s;equently an object of greater &s;or|row to her, than when &s;he believed him le&s;s worthy. &mdash; This, was the rever&s;e on his part towards her &mdash; no jealou&s;y inter|vened to bar his admiration and e&s;teem, and the beauty of her per&s;on, and gran|deur of her mien, not only confirmed, but improved, the exalted idea he had formed of her previous to their meet|ing, and which his affection to both her parents had in&s;pired.&mdash;The next time he &s;aw his benefactor, he began to feel a new e&s;teem and regard for him, for his daughter's &s;ake; as he had at fir&s;t an e&s;teem for her on the foundation of his love for Lord and Lady Elmwood&mdash;
<PB N="120" REF="121">
He gazed with wonder at his uncle's in&s;en&s;ibility to his own happine&s;s, and longed to lead him to the jewel he ca&s;t away, though even his own expul&s;ion &s;hould be the fatal con&s;equence. &mdash; Such was the youthful, warm, generous, grate|ful, but unthinking mind of Ru&s;hbrook.</P>

<P>AFTER this incident, Mi&s;s Wood|ley left her own apartments le&s;s frequently than before&mdash;&s;he was afraid, though till now mi&s;tru&s;t had been a &s;tranger to her heart, &s;he was afraid duplicity might be concealed under the apparent friend&s;hip of Ru&s;hbrook; it did not indeed appear &s;o from any part of his behaviour, but &s;he was apprehen&s;ive for the fate of Ma|tilda; &s;he di&s;liked him al&s;o, and there|fore &s;he &s;u&s;pected him.&mdash;For near three weeks &s;he had not now paid a vi&s;it to Lord Elmwood, and though to her&s;elf every vi&s;it was a pain, yet as Matilda took a delight in hearing of her father, what he &s;aid, what he did, what his at|tention
<PB N="122" REF="123">
&s;eemed mo&s;t employed on, and a thou&s;and other circum&s;tantial informa|tions, in the detail of which, Sandford would &s;corn to be half &s;o particular, it was a deprivation to her, Mi&s;s Woodley did not go oftener.&mdash;Now too the middle of November had arrived, and it was expected his Lord&s;hip would &s;hortly quit the country.</P>
<P>Partly therefore to indulge her haple&s;s companion, and partly becau&s;e it was a nece&s;&s;ary duty, Mi&s;s Woodley paid his Lord&s;hip a morning vi&s;it, and &s;taid din|ner. &mdash; Ru&s;hbrook was officiou&s;ly polite to her, (for that was the epithet &s;he gave his attention in relating it to Lady Ma|tilda) yet &s;he owned he had not that for|ward impertinence &s;he had formerly di&s;|covered in him, but appeared much more grave and &s;edate.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">"But tell me of my father." &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>"I was going, my dear &mdash; but don't be concerned &mdash; don't let it vex you."</P>
<P>"What? what?" cried Matilda, frightened by the preface.</P>
<P>"Why, on my ob&s;erving that I thought Mr. Ru&s;hbrook looked paler than u&s;ual, and appeared not to be in perfect health, (which was really the ca&s;e) your father expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t anxiety imaginable; he &s;aid he could not bear to &s;ee him look &s;o ill, begged him with all the tenderne&s;s of a parent to take the advice of a phy&s;ician, and added a thou&s;and other affectionate things."</P>
<P>"I dete&s;t Mr. Ru&s;hbrook."&mdash;&s;aid Ma|tilda, with her eyes fla&s;hing indignation.</P>
<P>"Nay, for &s;hame," returned Mi&s;s Woodley: "do you &s;uppo&s;e I told you this, to make you hate him?"</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">"No, there was no occa&s;ion for that," replied Matilda; "my &s;entiments (though I have never before avowed them) were long ago formed; he was always an object which added to my unhappine&s;s; but &s;ince his daring intru|&s;ion into my apartments, he has been an object of my hatred."</P>
<P>"But now perhaps I may tell you &s;omething to plea&s;e you." cried Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"And what is that?" &s;aid Matilda, with indifference; for the fir&s;t intelli|gence had hurt her &s;pirits too much to &s;uffer her to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to any other.</P>
<P>"Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," continued Mi&s;s Woodley, "replied to your father, his indi&s;po&s;ition was but a &s;light nervous fe|ver, and he would defer a phy&s;ician's advice till he went to London&mdash;on which

his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, "And when do you expect to be there?"&mdash;he replied, "With|in a week or two, I &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord." But your father an&s;wered, "I do not mean to go my&s;elf till after Chri&s;tmas." &mdash; "No indeed, my Lord!" &s;aid Mr. Sandford, with &s;urpri&s;e: "you have not pa&s;&s;ed your Chri&s;tmas here," continued he, "the&s;e many a year."&mdash;"No," re|turned his Lord&s;hip; "but I think I feel my&s;elf more attached to this hou&s;e at pre&s;ent, than ever I did in my life."</P>
<P>"You imagine then, my father thought of me, when he &s;aid that?" cried Matilda eagerly.</P>
<P>"But I may be mi&s;taken," replied Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash;"I leave you to judge. &mdash; But I am &s;ure Mr. Sandford imagined he thought of you, for I &s;aw a &s;mile over his whole face immediately."</P>
<P>"Did you, Mi&s;s Woodley?"</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">"Yes; it appeared on every feature except his lips; tho&s;e he clo&s;ed fa&s;t to|gether, for fear Lord Elmwood &s;hould perceive it."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, with all her minute intelligence, did not however acquaint Matilda that Ru&s;hbrook followed her to the window while his Lord&s;hip was out of the room, and Sandford half a&s;leep at the other end of it, and inquired re&s;pectfully and anxiou&s;ly for her Lady|&s;hip; adding, "It is my concern for Lady Matilda which makes me thus in|di&s;po&s;ed: I &s;uffer more than her; but I am not permitted to tell her &s;o, nor can I hope, Mi&s;s Woodley, you will."&mdash;She replied, "You are right, Sir." Nor did &s;he reveal this conver&s;ation, while not a &s;entence that pa&s;&s;ed except that, was omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="128">When Chri&s;tmas arrived Lord Elm|wood had many convivial days at Elm|wood Hou&s;e, but the name of Matilda was never mentioned by one of his gue&s;ts, and mo&s;t probably never thought of.&mdash; During all tho&s;e holidays &s;he was unu&s;u|ally melancholy, but &s;unk into the deep|e&s;t dejection when &s;he was told the day was fixed on which her father was to depart for the &s;ea&s;on. &mdash; On the morning of that day &s;he wept ince&s;&s;antly; and all her con&s;olation was, "She would go to the chamber window which was front|ing the door he was to pa&s;s through to his carriage, and for the fir&s;t time, and mo&s;t likely for the la&s;t time of her life, behold him."</P>
<P>This de&s;ign was &s;oon forgot in an|other: &mdash; "She would ru&s;h boldly into the apartment where he was, and at his
<PB N="128" REF="129">
feet take leave of him for ever&mdash;She would lay hold of his hands, cla&s;p his knees, provoke him to &s;purn her, which would be joy in compari&s;on to this cruel indifference."&mdash;In the bitterne&s;s of her grief, &s;he once called upon her mother, and reproached her memory&mdash;but the moment &s;he recollected the offence, (which was almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly) &s;he became all mildne&s;s and re&s;ignation. "What have I &s;aid?" cried &s;he; "Dear, dear &s;aint, forgive me, and behold for your &s;ake I will bear all with patience&mdash;I will not groan, I will not even &s;igh again&mdash;this ta&s;k I &s;et my|&s;elf to atone for what I have dared to utter."</P>
<P>While Lady Matilda laboured under the&s;e variety of &s;en&s;ations, Mi&s;s Wood|ley was occupied in bewailing and en|deavouring
<PB N="129" REF="130">
to calm her &s;orrows &mdash; and Lord Elmwood, with Ru&s;hbrook, was prepared ready to &s;et off. &mdash; His Lord|&s;hip, however, loitered, and did not once &s;eem in ha&s;te to be gone.&mdash;When at la&s;t he got up to depart, Sandford thought he pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and &s;hook it with more warmth than ever he had done in his life. &mdash; Encouraged by this &s;uppo&s;ition, Sandford, with the tears &s;tarting in his eyes, &s;aid, "my Lord, won't you conde&s;cend to take your leave of Mi&s;s Woodley?" &mdash; "Certainly, Sandford." replied his Lord&s;hip, and &s;eemed glad of an excu&s;e to &s;it down again.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of the &s;tate in which &s;he had left his only child, Mi&s;s Woodley, when &s;he came before Lord Elmwood to bid him farewell,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
was pale, trembling, and in tears. &mdash; Sandford, notwith&s;tanding his Lord&s;hip's apparent kind humour, was &s;hocked at the con&s;truction he mu&s;t put upon her appearance, and cried, "What, Mi&s;s Woodley, are you not recovered of your illne&s;s yet." Lord Elmwood, how|ever, took no notice of her looks, but after wi&s;hing her health and happine&s;s, walked &s;lowly out of the hou&s;e; turning back frequently and &s;peaking to Sand|ford or &s;ome other per&s;on who was be|hind him, as if part of his thoughts were left behind, and he went with reluc|tance.</P>
<P>When he had quitted the room where Mi&s;s Woodley was; Ru&s;hbrook, timid before her, as &s;he had been before her benefactor, went up to her all humility, and &s;aid, "Mi&s;s Woodley, we ought
<PB N="131" REF="132">
to be friends; our concern, our devo|tion is paid to the &s;ame objects, and one common intere&s;t &s;hould teach us to be friendly."</P>
<P>She made no reply.&mdash;"Will you per|mit me to write to you when I am away?" &s;aid he; "You may wi&s;h to hear of Lord Elmwood's health, and of what changes may take place in his re&s;o|lutions&mdash;Will you permit me?"&mdash;At that moment a &s;ervant came and &s;aid, "Sir, my Lord is in his carriage and waiting for you." He ha&s;ted away, and Mi&s;s Woodley was relieved from the pain of giving him a denial.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the chariot, with all its attendants, out of &s;ight, than Lady Matilda was conducted by Mi&s;s Wood|ley from her lonely retreat into that part of the hou&s;e from whence her father had
<PB N="132" REF="133">
ju&s;t departed&mdash;and &s;he vi&s;ited every &s;pot where he had &s;o long re&s;ided, with a plea&s;ing curio&s;ity that for a while di|verted her grief. &mdash; In the breakfa&s;t and dining rooms &s;he leaned over tho&s;e &s;eats with a kind of filial piety, on which &s;he was told he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;it. And in the library &s;he took up with filial delight, the pen with which he had been writing; and looked with the mo&s;t curious attention into tho&s;e books that were laid upon his reading de&s;k.&mdash;But a hat, lying on one of the tables, gave her a &s;en&s;ation beyond any other &s;he ex|perienced on thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ion&mdash;in that tri|fling article of his dre&s;s, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw he him&s;elf, and held it in her hand with pious reverence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Lord Elmwood and Ru&s;hbrook were proceeding on
<PB N="133" REF="134">
their road with hearts not le&s;s heavy than tho&s;e which they had left at Elm|wood Hou&s;e, though neither of them could &s;o well as Matilda tell the cau&s;e of the weight.</P>

<P>YOUNG as Lady Matilda was du|ring the life of her mother, neither her youth, nor the reclu&s;e &s;tate in which &s;he lived, had precluded her from the no|tice and &s;olicitations of a nobleman who had profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her lover. Vi&s;|count Margrave had an e&s;tate not far di&s;tant from the retreat Lady Elmwood had cho&s;en, and being devoted to the &s;ports of the country, he &s;eldom quitted it for any of tho&s;e joys which the town offered.&mdash;He was a young man, of a hand&s;ome per&s;on, and was what his neighbours &s;tiled "A man of &s;pirit."&mdash; He was an excellent fox-hunter, and as excellent a companion over his bottle at
<PB N="135" REF="136">
the end of the chace &mdash; he was prodigal of his fortune in all ca&s;es where his plea|&s;ures were concerned, and as tho&s;e plea|&s;ures were mo&s;tly &s;ocial, his &s;porting companions and his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es (for the&s;e were al&s;o of the plural number) partook largely of his wealth.</P>
<P>Two months previous to Lady Elm|wood's death, Mi&s;s Woodley and Lady Matilda were taking their u&s;ual walk in &s;ome fields and lanes near to their hou&s;e, when chance threw Lord Margrave in their way, during a thunder &s;torm in which they were &s;uddenly caught; and he had the &s;atisfaction to convey his new acquaintances to their home in his carri|age, &s;afe from the fury of the elements.&mdash; Grateful for the &s;ervice his Lord&s;hip had rendered them, Mi&s;s Woodley and her charge permitted him to enquire occa|&s;ionally
<PB N="136" REF="137">
of their healths, and would &s;ome-&s;ee him.&mdash;The &s;tory of Lady Elmwood was known to Lord Margrave, and as he beheld her daughter with a pa&s;&s;ion &s;uch as he had been unu&s;ed to over|come, he indulged it with the probable hope, that on the death of the mother Lord Elmwood would receive his child, and perhaps accept him as his &s;on-in-law. &mdash;Wedlock was not the plan which Lord Margrave had ever propo&s;ed to him&s;elf for happine&s;s; but the exce&s;s of his love on this new occa&s;ion, &s;ubdued every re|&s;olution he had taken again&s;t the marriage &s;tate, and not daring to hope for the con&s;ummation of his wi&s;hes by any other means, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to look for|ward to that, as his only re&s;ource.&mdash;No &s;ooner was the long-expected death of Lady Elmwood arrived, than his Lord|&s;hip waited with impatience to hear Lady

Matilda was &s;ent for and acknowledged by her father; for he meant to be the fir&s;t to lay before Lord Elmwood his preten&s;ions as a &s;uitor.&mdash;But tho&s;e preten|&s;ions were founded on the vague hopes of a lover only; and Mi&s;s Woodley, to whom he fir&s;t declared them, &s;aid every thing po&s;&s;ible to convince him of their falaciou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash; As to the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he was not only in&s;en&s;ible, but totally inattentive to all that was &s;aid to her on the &s;ubject.&mdash;Lady Elmwood died without ever being di&s;turbed with it; for her daughter did not even remember his propo&s;als &s;o as to repeat them again, and Mi&s;s Woodley thought it prudent to conceal from her friend, every new incident which might give her cau&s;e for fre&s;h anxieties.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">When Sandford and the ladies left the north and came to Elmwood Hou&s;e, &s;o much were their thoughts employed with other ideas, Lord Margrave did not oc|cupy a place; and during the whole time they had been at their new abode, they had never once heard of him.&mdash;He had, neverthele&s;s, his whole mind fixed upon Lady Matilda, and placed &s;pies in the neighbourhood to inform him of every circum&s;tance in her &s;ituation. &mdash; Having imbibed an aver&s;ion to matri|mony, he heard with but little regret, that there was no pro&s;pect of her ever becoming her father's heir; while &s;uch an information gave him the hope of obtaining her, upon the illegal terms of a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood's departure to town forwarded this hope, and flattering him|&s;elf
<PB N="139" REF="140">
that the humiliating &s;ituation in which Matilda mu&s;t feel her&s;elf in the hou&s;e of her father, might gladly induce her to take &s;helter under any other pro|tection, he boldly advanced as &s;oon as the Earl was gone, to make &s;uch over|tures as his wi&s;hes and his vanity told him, could not be rejected.</P>
<P>Inquiring for Mi&s;s Woodley, he ea&s;ily gained admittance; but at the &s;ight of &s;o much mode&s;ty and dignity in the per|&s;on of Matilda, &s;o much good will, and yet &s;uch circum&s;pection in her compa|nion; and the good &s;en&s;e and proper &s;pirit which were always apparent in the man|ners of Sandford, his Lord&s;hip fell once more into the de&s;pondency, of becoming to Lady Matilda nothing more important to his reputation, than a hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141">Even that humble hope was, however, &s;ometimes denied him, while Sandford &s;et forth the impropriety of troubling Lord Elmwood on &s;uch a &s;ubject at pre|&s;ent; and while the Vi&s;count's penetra|tion, &s;mall as it was, di&s;covered in his fair one much more to di&s;courage than to favour his wi&s;hes.&mdash;Plunged, how|ever, too deep in his pa&s;&s;ion to emerge from it in ha&s;te, he meant &s;till to vi&s;it, and wait for a change to happier circum|&s;tances, when he was peremptorily de|&s;ired by Mr. Sandford to de&s;i&s;t from ever coming again.</P>
<P>"Wherefore, Mr. Sandford?" cried his Lord&s;hip.</P>

<P>While Lord Margrave alternately che|ri&s;hed his hopes and his fears in the country, Ru&s;hbrook in town gave way to his fears only &mdash; every day of his life made him more acquainted with the firm, un&s;haken temper of Lord Elmwood, and every day whi&s;pered more forcibly to his own heart, that pity, gratitude, and friend&s;hip, &s;trong and affectionate as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are, are weak and cold to that, which had gained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&mdash;he doubted, but he did not long doubt, that which he felt was love.&mdash; "And yet," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "it is love of that kind, which ari&s;ing from cau&s;es independant of the object it&s;elf, can &s;carcely de&s;erve this &s;acred title.&mdash; Did I not love Lady Matilda before I

beheld her?&mdash;for her mother's &s;ake I loved her &mdash; and even for her father's.&mdash; Should I have felt the &s;ame affection for her, had &s;he been the child of other pa|rents?&mdash;no. Or &s;hould I have felt that &s;ympathetic tenderne&s;s which now preys upon my health, had not her misfortunes excited it?&mdash;no." &mdash; Yet the love which is the re&s;ult of gratitude and pity only, he thought had little claim to rank with his; and after the mo&s;t deliberate and deep reflection, he concluded with this deci&s;ive opinion&mdash;He had loved Lady Matilda, in <HI>whatever &s;tate,</HI> in <HI>whatever circum&s;tances</HI>; and that the tenderne&s;s he felt towards her, and the anxiety for her happine&s;s before he knew her, extreme as they were, were yet cool and di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate &s;en&s;ations, compared to that which her per&s;on and demeanour had incited&mdash; and though he acknowledged, that by
<PB N="145" REF="146">
tho&s;e preceding &s;entiments his heart was &s;oftened, prepared, and moulded, as it were, to receive this la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, yet the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion told him ge|nuine love, if not the ba&s;is on which it was founded, had been the certain con|&s;equence. &mdash; With a &s;trict &s;crutiny into his heart he &s;ought this knowledge, but arrived at it with a regret that amounted to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>To &s;hield him from de&s;pondency, he formed in his mind a thou&s;and projects, depicting the joys of his union with Lady Matilda; but her father's implacability &s;tood foremo&s;t and confounded them all. &mdash; His Lord&s;hip was a man who made but few re&s;olutions&mdash;tho&s;e were the effect of deliberation; and as he was not the lea&s;t capricious or incon&s;tant in his tem|per, they were re&s;olutions which no pro|bable
<PB N="146" REF="147">
event could &s;hake. &mdash; Love, that produces wonders, that &s;educes and &s;ub|dues the mo&s;t determined and rigid &s;pirits, had in two in&s;tances overcome the inflexibility of Lord Elmwood; he married Lady Elmwood contrary to his determination, becau&s;e he loved; and for the &s;ake of this beloved object, he had, contrary to his re&s;olution, taken under his immediate care young Ru&s;h|brook; but the magic which once en|chanted away this &s;pirit of immutability was no more &mdash; Lady Elmwood was no more, and the charm was broken.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Woodley was deprived the opportunity of de&s;iring Ru&s;hbrook not to write when he a&s;ked her the permi&s;&s;ion, he pa&s;&s;ed one whole morning in the gra|tification of forming and writing a letter to her, which he thought might po&s;&s;ibly

be &s;hewn to Matilda. &mdash; As he dur&s;t not touch upon any of tho&s;e circum&s;tances in which he was the mo&s;t intere&s;ted, that, joined to the re&s;pect he wi&s;hed to pay the lady to whom he wrote, limited his letter to about twenty lines; yet the &s;tudious manner with which the&s;e lines were dictated, the hope and fear they might, or might not, be &s;een and re|garded by Lady Matilda, rendered the ta&s;k an anxiety &s;o plea&s;ing, he could have wi&s;hed it to have la&s;ted for a year; and in all this magnifying of trifles was di&s;coverable, the never-failing &s;ymptom of ardent love.</P>
<P>A reply to this formal addre&s;s was a reward he wi&s;hed for with impatience, but he wi&s;hed in vain; and in the mid&s;t of his chagrin at the di&s;appointment, a &s;orrow, little thought of, occurred, and
<PB N="148" REF="149">
gave him a perturbation of mind he had never before experienced. &mdash; Lord Elm|wood propo&s;ed a wife to him; and in a way &s;o a&s;&s;ured of his acquie&s;cence, that if Ru&s;hbrook's life had depended upon his daring to di&s;pute his benefactor's will, he would not have had the courage to have done &s;o. There was, however, in his reply, and his embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;omething which his Lord&s;hip di&s;cerned from a free concurrence; and looking &s;teadfa&s;tly at him, he &s;aid, in that &s;tern manner which he now almo&s;t con&s;tantly adopted,</P>
<P>"You have no engagements, I &s;up|po&s;e? Have made no previous pro|mi&s;es?"</P>
<P>"None on earth, my Lord." replied Ru&s;hbrook candidly.</P>
<P>"Nor have you di&s;po&s;ed of your heart?"</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">"No, my Lord." replid he; but not candidly,&mdash;nor with the appearance of candour: for though he &s;poke ha&s;tily, it was rather like a man frightened than a&s;&s;ured.&mdash;He hurried to tell the fal&s;ehood he thought him&s;elf obliged to tell, that the pain and &s;hame might be over; but there Ru&s;hbrook was deceived; the lie once told was as trouble&s;ome as in the conception, and added to his fir&s;t con|confu&s;ion, an encrea&s;ing one.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood now fixed his eyes upon him with a &s;ullen contempt, and ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, &s;aid, "Ru&s;hbrook, if you have been &s;o incon&s;iderate as to give away your heart, tell me &s;o at once, and tell me the object."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;huddered at the thought.</P>
<P>"I here," continued his Lord&s;hip, "tolerate the fir&s;t untruth you ever told
<PB N="150" REF="151">
me, as the fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion of a lover; and give you an opportunity to recall it&mdash;but after this moment, it is a lie be|tween man and man&mdash;a lie to your friend and father, and I will not forgive it."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;tood &s;ilent, confu&s;ed, alarmed, and bewildered in his thoughts. &mdash;His Lord&s;hip re&s;umed,</P>
<P>"Name the per&s;on, if there is any &s;uch, on whom you have be&s;towed your heart; and though I do not give you the &s;malle&s;t hope I &s;hall not cen&s;ure your folly, I will at lea&s;t not reproach you for having at fir&s;t denied it."</P>
<P>To repeat the&s;e words in writing, the reader mu&s;t condemn the young man that he could he&s;itate to own he loved, if he was even afraid to name the object of his pa&s;&s;ion; but his Lord&s;hip in his que&s;tion had made the two an&s;wers in&s;e|parable,

and all eva&s;ions of the &s;econd, Ru&s;hbrook knew would be fruitle&s;s, after having avowed the fir&s;t&mdash;and how could he confe&s;s the latter? The ab&s;o|lute orders he received from the &s;teward on his fir&s;t return from his travels, were, "Never to mention his daughter, any more than his late wife, before Lord Elmwood."&mdash;The fault of having rudely intruded into Lady Matilda's pre&s;ence, ru&s;hed too upon his mind; for he did not even dare to &s;ay, by what means he had beheld her. &mdash; But more than all, the threatening manner in which his Lord|&s;hip uttered this rational and &s;eeming conciliating &s;peech, the menaces, the &s;everity which &s;at upon his countenance while he delivered tho&s;e moderate words, might have intimidated a man wholly independent, and le&s;s u&s;ed to fear him than his nephew had been.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">"You make no an&s;wer, Sir." &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, after waiting a few mo|ments for his reply.</P>
<P>"I have only to &s;ay, my Lord," re|turned Ru&s;hbrook, "that although my heart may be totally di&s;engaged, I may yet be di&s;inclined to the pro&s;pect of mar|riage."</P>
<P>"May! May! Your heart <HI>may</HI> be di&s;engaged," repeated his Lord&s;hip. "Do you dare to reply to me equivo|cally, when I have a&s;ked a po&s;itive an|&s;wer?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps I am not po&s;itive my&s;elf, my Lord; but I will inquire the &s;tate of my mind, and make you acquainted with it very &s;oon."</P>
<P>As the angry demeanour of his uncle affected Ru&s;hbrook with fear, &s;o that fear, powerfully (but with proper man|line&s;s)

expre&s;&s;ed, again &s;oftened the di&s;|plea&s;ure of Lord Elmwood; and &s;eeing and pitying his nephew's &s;en&s;ibilit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e now changed his au&s;tere voice, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mildly, but firmly,</P>

He left the room at the&s;e words, and left Ru&s;hbrook relea&s;ed from a fate, which his apprehen&s;ions had be|held depending that moment.</P>
<P>He had now a week to call his thoughts together, to weigh every circum&s;tance, and to determine whether implicitly to &s;ubmit to his Lord&s;hip's recommenda|tion for a wi&s;e, or revolt from it, and &s;ee &s;ome other more &s;ub&s;ervient to his will, appointed his heir.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">Undetermined how to act upon this great trial which was to decide his fu|ture de&s;tiny, Ru&s;hbrook &s;uffered &s;o poignant an uncertainty, that he became at length ill, and before the end of the week which his uncle had allotted him for his reply, he was confined to his bed in a high fever.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip was ex|tremely affected at his indi&s;po&s;ition; he gave him every care he could be&s;tow, and even a great deal of his per&s;onal attendance.&mdash;This la&s;t favour had a claim upon the young man's gratitude, &s;uperior to every other obligation which &s;ince his infancy his benefactor had con&s;erred; and he was at times &s;o moved by tho&s;e marks of kindne&s;s he received from Lord Elmwood, he would form the in|tention of tearing from his heart every trace Lady Matilda had left there, and as &s;oon as his health permitted him, obey

to the utmo&s;t of his views every wi&s;h his uncle had conceived. &mdash; Yet again, Matilda's pitiable &s;ituation pre&s;ented it|&s;elf to his compa&s;&s;ion, and her beautious per&s;on to his love. &mdash; Divided between the claims of obligation to the father, and tender attachment to the daughter, his &s;ickne&s;s was increa&s;ed by the tortures of his mind, and he once &s;incerely wi&s;hed for that death, of which he was in danger, to free him from the dilem|ma into which his affections had involv|ed him.</P>
<P>At the time his illne&s;s was at its height, and he lay complaining of the violence of his fever, Lord Elmwood, taking his hand, a&s;ked him, "If there was any thing he could do for him?"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, my Lord, a great deal." he replied eagerly</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">"What is it, Harry?" a&s;ked his Lord&s;hip kindly.</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord," replied he, "that is what I mu&s;t not tell you."</P>
<P>"Defer it then till you are well." &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, fearful of being &s;ur|pri&s;ed, or affected by the &s;tate of his health, into any promi&s;es which he might hereafter find the impropriety of grant|ing.</P>
<P>"And when I recover, my Lord, you give me leave to reveal to you, that which I wi&s;h you to comply with, let it be what it will?"</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip he&s;itated&mdash;but &s;eeing an anxiety for the an&s;wer, by his rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his elbow in the bed and &s;taring wildly, Lord Elmwood at la&s;t &s;aid, "Certainly &mdash; Yes, yes." as a child is an&s;wered for its quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">That Lord Elmwood could have no idea what was the real petition which Ru&s;hbrook meant to pre&s;ent him is cer|tain; but it is certain he expected he had &s;ome reque&s;t to make, with which it might be wrong for him to comply, and therefore he avoided hearing what it was; for great as his compa&s;&s;ion for him in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, it was not of force to urge him to give a promi&s;e he did not mean to perform.&mdash;Ru&s;h|brook on his part was plea&s;ed with the a&s;&s;urance he might &s;peak when he was re&s;tored to health, but no &s;ooner was his fever abated, and his &s;en&s;es perfectly recovered from the &s;light derangement his malady had cau&s;ed, than the lively remembrance of what he had hinted alarmed him, and he was even afraid to look his kind, but awful relation in the face. &mdash; Lord Elmwood's cheerfulne&s;s,

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the illne&s;s of Ru&s;hbrook, news had been &s;ent of his danger from the &s;ervants in town to tho&s;e at Elmwood Hou&s;e, and Lady Matilda expre&s;&s;ed compa&s;&s;ion when &s;he was told of it&mdash;&s;he began to conceive the in&s;tant &s;he thought he would &s;oon die, that his vi&s;it to her had &s;ome merit rather than impertinence in its de&s;ign, and that he might po&s;&s;ibly be a more de&s;erving man than &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed him to be. Even Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley began to recollect qualifications he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which they never had reflected on before, and Mi&s;s Woodley in particular reproached her|&s;elf that &s;he had been &s;o &s;evere and inat|tentive
<PB N="161" REF="162">
to him. &mdash; Notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;pects his death pointed out to her, it was with infinite joy &s;he heard he was recovered; nor was Sandford le&s;s &s;atis|fied; for he had treated the young man too unkindly not to dread, le&s;t any ill &s;hould befall him;&mdash;but although he was glad to hear of his re&s;tored health, when he was informed he was coming down to Elmwood Hou&s;e for a few weeks in the &s;tyle of its ma&s;ter, Sandford, with all his religious and humane principles, could not help thinking, "that provided the lad had been properly prepared, he had been as well out of the world as in it."</P>
<P>He was &s;till le&s;s his friend when he &s;aw him arrive with his u&s;ual florid ap|pearance: had he come pale and &s;ickly, Sandford had been kind to him; but in apparent good health and &s;pirits, he
<PB N="162" REF="163">
could not form his mouth to tell him he was "glad to &s;ee him."</P>
<P>On his arrival, Matilda, who for five months had been at large, &s;ecluded her|&s;elf as &s;he would have done upon the arrival of Lord Elmwood; but with far different &s;en&s;ations. &mdash; Notwith&s;tanding her re&s;triction on the latter occa&s;ion, the re&s;idence of her father in that hou&s;e had been a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, rather than of &s;orrow to her; but from the abode of Ru&s;hbrook &s;he derived puni&s;hment alone.</P>
<P>When, from inquiries made to his own &s;ervant, who inquired again, Ru&s;h|brook found that on his approach Ma|tilda had retired to her own confined apartments, the thought was torture to him; it was the hope of &s;eeing and con|ver&s;ing with her, of being admitted at
<PB N="163" REF="164">
all times to her &s;ociety as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, that had rai&s;ed his &s;pirits, and effected his perfect cure, beyond any other cau&s;e; and he was hurt to the greate&s;t degree at this re&s;pect, or rather contempt, &s;hown to him by her retreat.</P>
<P>It was, neverthele&s;s, a &s;ubject too de|licate to touch upon in any one &s;en&s;e&mdash; an invitation for her company on his part, might carry the appearance of &s;u|perior authority, and an affected conde|&s;cen&s;ion, which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the wor&s;t of all in&s;ults.&mdash;And yet, how could he &s;upport the idea that his vi&s;it had placed the daughter of his benefactor as a dependant &s;tranger in that hou&s;e, where in reality he was the dependant, and &s;he the lawful heir. &mdash; For two or three days he &s;uffered the torments of the&s;e reflec|tions, hoping to come to an explanation
<PB N="164" REF="165">
of all he felt by a fortunate meeting with Mi&s;s Woodley; but when that meeting occurred, although he ob&s;erved &s;he talk|ed to him with le&s;s re&s;erve than &s;he had formerly done, and even gave &s;ome proofs of the goodne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, yet &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly avoided naming Lady Matilda; and when he diffidently enquired of her Lady&s;hip's health, a cold re&s;traint &s;pread over Mi&s;s Woodley's face, and &s;he left him in&s;tantly.&mdash;To Sandford it was &s;till more difficult to apply; for though they were frequently together, they were never &s;ociable; and as Sand|ford &s;eldom di&s;gui&s;ed his feelings, to Ru&s;hbrook he was always extremley &s;e|vere, and &s;ometimes unmannerly.</P>
<P>In this perplexed &s;ituation, the coun|try air was rather of detriment than &s;er|vice to the invalid; and had he not, like
<PB N="165" REF="166">
a true lover, held fa&s;t to hope, while he could perceive nothing but de&s;pair; he had returned to town, rather than by his &s;tay placed in a &s;ubordinate &s;tate the object of his adoration.&mdash;But &s;till per&s;i&s;t|ing in his hopes, he one morning met Mi&s;s Woodley in the garden, and en|gaging her a longer time than u&s;ual in conver&s;ation, at la&s;t obtained her promi&s;e "She would that day dine with him and Mr. Sandford."&mdash;But no &s;ooner had &s;he parted from him than &s;he repented of her con&s;ent, and upon communicating it to Matilda, that young lady, for the fir&s;t time in her life, darted upon her kind companion, a look of the mo&s;t cut|ting reproach and haughty re&s;entment.&mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley's own &s;entiments had up|braided her before; but &s;he was not pre|pared to receive &s;o pointed a mark of di&s;approbation from her young friend,
<PB N="166" REF="167">
till now, duteous and humble to her as to a mother, and not le&s;s affectionate. Her heart was too &s;u&s;ceptible to bear this di&s;re&s;pectful and contumelious frown from the object of her long-devoted care and concern; the tears in&s;tantly covered her face, and &s;he laid her hands upon her heart, as if &s;he thought it would break.&mdash;Matilda was moved, but &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed too much of the manly re&s;entment of her father, to di&s;cover what &s;he felt for the fir&s;t few minutes. &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley, who had given &s;o many tears to her &s;orrows, but never till now, one to her anger, had a &s;till deeper &s;en&s;e of this indifference, than of the anger it&s;elf, and to conceal what &s;he &s;uffered, left the room.&mdash;Matil|da, who had been till this time working at her needle, &s;eemingly compo&s;ed, now let her work drop from her hand, and &s;at for a little while in a deep reverie.&mdash;
<PB N="167" REF="168">
At length &s;he ro&s;e up, and followed Mi&s;s Woodley to the other apartment.&mdash; She entered grave, maje&s;tical, and appa|rently &s;erene, while her poor heart flutter|ed with a thou&s;and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ations.&mdash; She approached Mi&s;s Woodley (who was &s;till in tears) with a &s;ullen &s;ilence; and awed by her manners the faithful friend of her decea&s;ed mother exclaimed, "Dear Lady Matilda, think no more on what I have done &mdash; do not re&s;ent it any longer, and on my knees I'll beg your pardon." Mi&s;s Woodley ro&s;e as &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words; but Ma|tilda laid fa&s;t hold of her to prevent the po&s;ture &s;he offered to take, and in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umed it her&s;elf. "Oh, let this be my atonement!" &s;he cried with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplication.</P>
<P>They interchanged forgivene&s;s; and as this reconciliation was &s;incere, they
<PB N="168" REF="169">
each without re&s;erve gave their opinion upon the &s;ubject that had cau&s;ed the mi&s;|under&s;tanding; and it was agreed that an apology &s;hould be &s;ent to Mr. Ru&s;h|brook, "That Mi&s;s Woodley had been &s;uddenly indi&s;po&s;ed." nor could this be &s;aid to differ from the truth, for &s;ince what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;he was unfit to pay a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, who had been all the morning elated with the advance he &s;up|po&s;ed he had made in that lady's favour, was highly di&s;appointed, vext, and an|gry when this apology was delivered to him; nor did he, nor perhaps could he, conceal what he felt, although his &s;evere ob&s;erver, Mr. Sandford, was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>"I am a very unfortunate man." &s;aid he, as &s;oon as the &s;ervant was gone who brought the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">Sandford ca&s;t his eyes upon him with a look of &s;urpri&s;e and contempt.</P>
<P>"A very unfortunate man indeed, Mr. Sandford," repeated he, "although you treat my complaint contemptu|ou&s;ly."</P>
<P>Sandford made no reply, and &s;eemed above making one.</P>
<P>They &s;at down to dinner;&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook eat &s;carce any thing, but drank frequent|ly; Sandford took no notice of either, but had a book (which was his cu&s;tom when he dined with per&s;ons who&s;e con|ver&s;ation was not intere&s;ting to him) laid by the &s;ide of his plate, which he occa&s;ionally looked into, as the di&s;hes were removing, or other opportunities &s;erved.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, ju&s;t now more hopele&s;s than ever of forming an acquaintance
<PB N="170" REF="171">
with Lady Matilda, began to give way to the &s;ymptoms of de&s;pair; and they made their fir&s;t attack by urging him to treat on the &s;ame level of familiarity that he him&s;elf was treated, Mr. Sand|ford, to whom he had till now ever behaved with the mo&s;t profound tokens of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid he to him as &s;oon as the dinner was removed, "Lay a&s;ide your book and be good company."</P>
<P>Sandford lifted up his eyes upon him &mdash;&s;tared in his face&mdash;and ca&s;t them on the book again.</P>
<P>"I &s;ay," continued Ru&s;hbrook, "I want a companion; and as Mi&s;s Wood|ley has di&s;appointed me, I mu&s;t have your company."</P>
<P>Sandford now laid down his book upon the table, but &s;till holding his fingers in the pages he was reading, &s;aid, "And
<PB N="171" REF="172">
why are you di&s;appointed of Mi&s;s Wood|ley's company?&mdash;When people expect what they have no right to hope for, they have yet the a&s;&s;urance to complain they are di&s;appointed."</P>
<P>"I had a right to expect &s;he would come," an&s;wered Ru&s;hbrook, "for &s;he promi&s;ed &s;he would.</P>
<P>"But what right had you to a&s;k her?"</P>
<P>"The right every one has, to make his time pa&s;s as agreeably as he can."</P>
<P>"But not at the expence of another."</P>
<P>"I believe, Mr. Sandford, it would be a heavy expence to you, to &s;ee me happy; I believe it would co&s;t you even your own happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"That is a price I have not now to give." replied Sandford, and he began reading again.</P>
<P>"What, you have already paid it away? No wonder that at your time of
<PB N="172" REF="173">
life it &s;hould be gone.&mdash;But what do you think of my having already &s;quandered mine?"</P>
<P>"I don't think about you." returned Sandford, without taking his eyes from the book.</P>
<P>"Can you look me in the face and &s;ay that, Mr. Sandford?&mdash;No, you cannot &mdash; for you know you <HI>do</HI> think of me, and you know you hate me."&mdash;Here he drank two gla&s;&s;es of wine one after another; "And I can tell you why you hate me." continued he: "It is from a cau&s;e for which I often hate my|&s;elf."</P>
<P>Sandford read on.</P>
<P>"It is on Lady Matilda's account you hate me, and u&s;e me thus."</P>
<P>Sandford put down his book ha&s;tily, and put both his hands by his &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">"Yes," re&s;umed Ru&s;hbrook, "you think I am wronging her."</P>
<P>"I think you gro&s;&s;ly in&s;ult her," ex|claimed Sandford, "by this rude men|tion of her name; and I command you at your peril to de&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>"At my peril! Mr. Sandford? Do you a&s;&s;ume the authority of Lord Elm|wood?"</P>
<P>"I do on this occa&s;ion; and if you dare to give your tongue a freedom"&mdash;</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook interrupted him&mdash;"Why then I boldly &s;ay, (and as her friend you ought rather to applaud than re&s;ent it) I boldly &s;ay, my heart &s;uffers &s;o much for her &s;ituation, I am regardle&s;s of my own.&mdash;I love her father&mdash;I loved her mother more&mdash;but &s;he her&s;elf beyond either."</P>
<P>"Hold your licentious tongue," cried Sandford, "or quit the room."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">"Licentious? Oh! the pure thoughts that dwell in her innocent mind, are not le&s;s &s;en&s;ual than mine towards her.&mdash;Do you upbraid me with my re&s;pect, my pity for her? They are the &s;en&s;ations which impel me to &s;peak thus undi&s;gui&s;ed, even to you, my open&mdash;no, even wor&s;e&mdash; my &s;ecret enemy!"</P>
<P>"In&s;ult <HI>me</HI> as you plea&s;e, Mr. Ru&s;h|brook,&mdash;but beware how you mention Lord Elmwood's daughter."</P>
<P>"Can it be to her di&s;honour that I pity her? that I would quit the hou&s;e this moment never to return, &s;o &s;he &s;up|plied the place I withhold from her."</P>
<P>"Go, then." cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"It would be of no u&s;e to her, or I would. &mdash; But come, Mr. Sandford, I will dare do as much as you.&mdash;Only &s;e|cond me, and I will entreat Lord Elm|wood
<PB N="175" REF="176">
to be reconciled&mdash;to &s;ee and own her."</P>
<P>"Your vanity would be equal to your ra&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;You entreat?&mdash;She mu&s;t greatly e&s;teem tho&s;e parental favours which your entreaties gained her! &mdash; Do you forget, young man, how &s;hort a time it is, &s;ince you were entreated for?"</P>
<P>"I prove I do not, while this anxiety for Lady Matilda, ari&s;es, from what I feel on that account."</P>
<P>"Remove your anxiety, then, from her to your&s;elf; for were I to let Lord Elmwood know what has pa&s;&s;ed now"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is for your own &s;ake, not for mine, if you don't."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not dare me to it, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook,"&mdash;And he ro&s;e from his &s;eat: "You &s;hall not dare me to do you an injury.&mdash;But to avoid the temptation, I will never again come into your com|pany,
<PB N="176" REF="177">
unle&s;s my friend Lord Elmwood is pre&s;ent, to protect me and his child from your in&s;ults."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook ro&s;e in yet more warmth than Sandford. "Have you the in|ju&s;tice to &s;ay I have in&s;ulted Lady Ma|tilda?"</P>
<P>"To &s;peak of her at all, is in you an in&s;ult. &mdash; But you have done more &mdash; You have dared to vi&s;it her&mdash;to force into her pre&s;ence and &s;hock her with your offers of &s;ervices which &s;he &s;corns; and of your compa&s;&s;ion which &s;he is far above."</P>
<P>"Did &s;he complain to you?"</P>
<P>"She, or her friend did."</P>
<P>"I rather &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. Sandford, you have bribed &s;ome of the &s;ervants to reveal this."</P>
<P>"The &s;u&s;picion becomes Lord Elm|wood's heir."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">"It becomes the man, who lives in a hou&s;e with you."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, for what has pa&s;&s;ed this day&mdash;it has taken a weight off my mind.&mdash;I thought my di&s;|inclination to you, might perhaps ari&s;e from prejudice&mdash;this conver&s;ation has relieved me from tho&s;e fears, and I thank you." &mdash; Saying this he calmly walked out of the room, and left Ru&s;h|brook to reflect on what he had been doing.</P>
<P>Heated with the wine he had drank, (and which Sandford engaged on his book had not ob&s;erved) no &s;ooner was he alone, than he became at once cool and repentant.&mdash; "What had he done?" was the fir&s;t que&s;tion to him&s;elf&mdash;"He had offended Sandford" &mdash; The man whom rea&s;on as well as prudence had
<PB N="178" REF="179">
ever taught him to treat with re&s;pect and even reverence.&mdash;He had gro&s;&s;ly offended the firm friend of Lady Matilda, and even by the unre&s;erved, the wanton u&s;e of her name. &mdash; All the retorts he had uttered came now to his memory; with a total forgetfulne&s;s of all Sandford had &s;aid to provoke them.</P>
<P>He once thought to follow him and Beg his pardon; but the contempt with which he had been treated, more than all the anger, withheld him.</P>
<P>As he &s;at forming plans how to re|trieve the opinion, ill as it was, which Sandford formerly entertained of him, he received a letter from Lord Elm|wood, kindly enquiring after his health, and &s;aying he &s;hould be down early in the following week. &mdash; Never were the friendly expre&s;&s;ions of his Lord&s;hip half
<PB N="179" REF="180">
&s;o welcome to him; for they &s;erved to &s;ooth his imagination, racked with Sand|ford's wrath and his own di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Sandford acted deliberately he always acted up to his duty; it was his duty to forgive Ru&s;hbrook and he did &s;o &mdash; but he had declared he would never "be again in his company unle&s;s Lord Elmwood was pre&s;ent;"&mdash;and with all his forgivene&s;s, he found an unfor|giving gratification, in the duty, of being obliged to keep his word.</P>
<P>The next day Ru&s;hbrook dined alone, while Sandford gave his company to the ladies. &mdash; Ru&s;hbrook was too proud to &s;eek to Sandford with abject conce&s;|&s;ions, but he endeavoured to meet him
<PB N="181" REF="182">
as by accident, and try what, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive apology might effect. &mdash; For a day or two, all the &s;chemes he formed on that head proved fruitle&s;s; he could never procure even a &s;ight of him.&mdash;But on the evening of the third day, taking a lonely walk, he turned the corner of a grove, and &s;aw in the very path he was going, Sandford ac|companied by Mi&s;s Woodley; and, what agitated him much more, Lady Matilda was with them.&mdash;He knew not whether to proceed, or to quit the path and palpably &s;hun them &mdash; To one who &s;eemed to put an unkind con&s;truction upon all he &s;aid and did, he knew to do either, would be to do wrong.&mdash;In &s;pite of the propen&s;ity he felt to pa&s;s &s;o near to Lady Matilda, could he have known what conduct would have been deemed the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, whatever painful
<PB N="182" REF="183">
denial it had co&s;t him, that, he would have adopted.&mdash;But undetermined whe|ther to go forward, or to cro&s;s to another path, he &s;till walked on till he came too nigh to recede; he then, with a diffi|dence not affected, but felt in the mo&s;t powerful degree, pulled of his hat; and without bowing, &s;tood &s;ilently while the company pa&s;&s;ed. &mdash; Sandford walked on &s;ome paces before, and took no farther notice as he went by him, than ju&s;t touching the fore part of his hat with his finger.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley curt&s;ied as &s;he followed.&mdash;But Lady Matilda made a full &s;top, and &s;aid, in the gentle&s;t ac|cents, "I hope, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, you are perfectly recovered."</P>
<P>It was the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic he ever li&s;|tened to; and he returned with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow, "I am better a great deal, Ma'am." and pur&s;ued his way as
<PB N="183" REF="184">
if he did not dare to utter another &s;yl|lable.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;eldom found fault with Lady Matilda; not becau&s;e he loved her, but becau&s;e &s;he &s;eldom did wrong&mdash; upon this occa&s;ion, however, he was half inclined to reprimand her; but yet he did not know what to &s;ay&mdash;the &s;ub&s;e|quent humility of Ru&s;hbrook had taken from the indi&s;cretion of her &s;peaking to him, and the event could by no means ju&s;tify his cen&s;ure.&mdash;On hearing her be|gin to &s;peak Sandford had &s;topped; and as Ru&s;hbrook after replying, walked away, Sandford called to her cro&s;&s;ly, "Come, come along." But at the &s;ame time he put out his elbow for her to take hold of his arm.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tened her &s;teps, and did &s;o&mdash; then turning to Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he &s;aid, "I expected you would have &s;poken
<PB N="184" REF="185">
to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook; it might have pre|vented me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley replied, "I was at a lo&s;s what to do;&mdash;when we met formerly, he always &s;poke fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"And ought now." cried Sandford angrily&mdash;and then added, with a &s;arca&s;|tic &s;mile, "It is certainly the duty of the &s;uperior, to be the fir&s;t who &s;peaks."</P>
<P>"He did not look as if he thought him&s;elf our &s;uperior." replied Matilda.</P>
<P>"No," returned Sandford, "&s;ome people can put on what looks they plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then while he looks &s;o pale," re|plied Matilda, "and &s;o dejected, I can never forbear &s;peaking to him when we meet, whatever he may think of it."</P>
<P>"And were he and I to meet a hun|dred, nay a thou&s;and times," replied
<PB N="185" REF="186">
Sandford, "I don't think I &s;hall ever &s;peak to him again."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me! what for, Mr. Sandford?" cried Matilda &mdash; for Sandford, who was not a man that repeated little incidents, had never mentioned the circum&s;tance of their quarrel.</P>
<P>"I have taken &s;uch a re&s;olution,"&mdash; an&s;wered he, "yet I bear him no en|mity."</P>
<P>As this &s;hort reply indicated he meant to &s;ay no more, no more was a&s;ked; and the &s;ubject dropped.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Ru&s;hbrook, hap|pier than he had been for months; in|toxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of civilty he had received from Lady Matilda, felt his heart &s;o joyous, &s;o free from every particle of malice, that he re&s;olved in the humble&s;t man|ner,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
to make atonement for the breach of decorum he had lately been guilty of to Mr. Sandford.</P>
<P>Too happy at this time to &s;uffer a mortification from any treatment he might receive, he &s;ent his &s;ervant to him into his &s;tudy, as &s;oon as he was returned home, to beg to know "If he might be permitted to wait upon him, with a me&s;&s;age he had to deliver from Lord Elmwood."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant returned &mdash; "Mr. Sand|ford de&s;ired he would &s;end the me&s;&s;age by him, or the hou&s;e &s;teward." This was highly affronting; but Ru&s;hbrook was not in a humour to be offended, and he &s;ent again, begging he would admit him; &mdash;but the an&s;wer was, "He was bu&s;y."</P>
<P>Thus defeated in his hopes of recon|ciliation, his new tran&s;ports felt an allay,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
and the few days that remained before Lord Elmwood came, he pa&s;&s;ed in &s;oli|tary mu&s;ing, and ineffectual walks and looks towards that path where he had met Matilda &mdash; &s;he came that way no more &mdash; nor indeed &s;carce quitted her apartment, in the practice of that con|finement &s;he had to experience on the arrival of her father.</P>
<P>All her former agitations now return|ed.&mdash;On the day he arrived &s;he wept &mdash; all the night &s;he did not &s;leep &mdash; and the name of Ru&s;hbrook again became hateful to her. &mdash; His Lord&s;hip came in extreme good health and &s;pirits, but ap|peared concerned to find Ru&s;hbrook le&s;s well than when he went from town. &mdash; Sandford was now under the nece&s;&s;ity of being in Ru&s;hbrook's company, yet he took care never to &s;peak to him but when
<PB N="188" REF="189">
he was obliged; or to look at him but when he could not help it.&mdash;Lord Elm|wood ob&s;erved this conduct, yet he neither wondered, or was offended at it&mdash; he had always perceived what little e&s;teem Sandford &s;howed his nephew from his fir&s;t return; but he forgave in Sandford's humour a thou&s;and faults he would for|give in no other; nor did he deem this one of his greate&s;t faults, knowing the claim to his partiality from another object.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley waited on Lord Elm|wood as formerly; dined with him, and as heretofore related to the attentive Ma|tilda all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>About this time Lord Margrave, de|prived by the &s;ea&s;on of all the &s;ports of the field, felt his love for Matilda (which had been extreme while divided with the
<PB N="189" REF="190">
love of hunting) too violent to be &s;ubdued; and he re&s;olved, though re|luctantly, to apply to her father for his con&s;ent to their union;&mdash;but writing to Sandford this re&s;olution, he was once more repul&s;ed, and charged as a man of honour, to forbear to di&s;turb the tran|quility of the family by any application of the kind.&mdash;To this Sandford received no an&s;wer; for his Lord&s;hip, highly incen&s;ed at his mi&s;tre&s;s's repugnance to him, determined more firmly than ever, to con&s;ult his own happine&s;s alone; and as that depended merely upon his ob|taining her, he cared not by what me|thod it was effected.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after Lord Elmwood came into the country, as he was riding one morning, his hor&s;e fell with him, and cru&s;hed his leg in &s;o unfortunate a
<PB N="190" REF="191">
manner, as to be pronounced of dange|rous con&s;equence. &mdash; He was brought home in a po&s;t chai&s;e, and Matilda heard of the accident with more grief than would, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, appertain to the mo&s;t fondled child.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the pain he &s;uffered his fever was one night very high; and Sandford, who &s;eldom quitted his apart|ment, went frequently to his bed &s;ide; every time with the &s;ecret hope he &s;hould hear him a&s;k to &s;ee his daughter &mdash;he was every time di&s;appointed&mdash;yet he &s;aw him &s;hake with a cordial friend|&s;hip the hand of Ru&s;hbrook, as if he de|lighted in &s;eeing tho&s;e he loved.</P>
<P>The danger in which Lord Elmwood was &s;uppo&s;ed to be, was but of &s;hort dura|tion, and his &s;udden recovery &s;ucceeded. &mdash;Matida who had wept, moaned, and
<PB N="191" REF="192">
watched during the cri&s;is of his illne&s;s, when &s;he heard he was amending, ex|claimed (with a kind of &s;urpri&s;e at the novelty of the &s;en&s;ation) "And this is joy that I feel!&mdash;Oh! I never till now knew, what tho&s;e per&s;ons felt that expe|rienced joy."</P>
<P>Nor did &s;he repine, like Mr. Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley, at her father's inat|tention to her during his malady, for &s;he did not hope like them&mdash;&s;he did not hope he would behold her, even in dying.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding his Lord&s;hip's &s;eeming indifference while his indi&s;po&s;i|tion continued, no &s;ooner was he recover|ed &s;o as to receive the congratulations of his friends, than there was no one per&s;on he evidently &s;howed &s;o much &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing, as Mi&s;s Woodley.&mdash; She waited upon him timorou&s;ly, and with more than
<PB N="192" REF="193">
ordinary di&s;ta&s;te at his late conduct; when he put out his hand with the utmo&s;t warmth to receive her, drew her to him, &s;aluted her, (an honour he had never in his life conferred before) and all with &s;igns of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip and af|fection. &mdash; Sandford was pre&s;ent, and ever a&s;&s;ociating the idea of Matilda with Mi&s;s Woodley, felt his heart bound with a triumph it had not enjoyed for many a day.</P>
<P>Matilda li&s;tened with delight to the recital Mi&s;s Woodley gave on her re|turn, and many times while it la&s;ted exclaimed "She was happy." But poor Matilda's &s;udden tran&s;ports of joy, which &s;he termed happine&s;s, were not made for long continuance; and if &s;he ever found cau&s;e for gladne&s;s, &s;he far oftener had motives for grief.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">As Mr. Sandford was &s;itting with her and Mi&s;s Woodley one evening about a week after, a per&s;on rung at the bell and enquired for him; on being told of it by the &s;ervant, he went to the door of the apartment and cried "Oh! is it you? Come in." &mdash; An elderly man entered, who had been for many years the head gardener at Elmwood Hou&s;e; a man of hone&s;ty and &s;obriety, and with a large indigent family of aged parents, children, and other relatives, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted whol|ly on the income ari&s;ing from his place &mdash; The ladies, as well as Sandford, know him well, and they all, almo&s;t at once, a&s;ked "What was the matter?" for his looks told them &s;omething di&s;tre&s;sful had befallen him.</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir!" &s;aid he to Sandford, "I come to entreat your intere&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">"In what, Edwards?" &s;aid Sandford with a mild voice; for when his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;upplicated in di&s;tre&s;s, his rough tones always took a plaintive key.</P>
<P>"My Lord has di&s;charged me from his &s;ervice,"&mdash;(returned Edwards trem|bling, and the tears &s;tarting in his eyes) "I am undone, Mr. Sandford, unle&s;s you plead for me."</P>
<P>"I will," &s;aid Sandford, "I will."</P>
<P>"And yet I am almo&s;t afraid of your &s;ucce&s;s," replied the man, "for my Lord has ordered me out of his hou&s;e this moment; and though I knelt down to him to be heard, he had no pity."</P>
<P>Matilda &s;ighed from the bottom of her heart, and yet &s;he envied this poor man who had been kneeling to her father.</P>
<P>"What was your offence?" cried Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">The man he&s;itated; then looking at Matilda, &s;aid, "I'll tell you, Sir, &s;ome other time."</P>
<P>"Did you name me, before Lord Elmwood?" cried &s;he eagerly, and ter|rified.</P>
<P>No, Madam," replied he, "but I unthinkingly &s;poke of my poor Lady that is dead and gone."</P>
<P>Matilda bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"How came you to do &s;o mad a thing?" cried Sandford, with the en|couragement his looks had once given him, now fled from his face.</P>
<P>"It was unthinkingly," repeated Ed|wards; "I was &s;howing my Lord &s;ome plans for the new walks, and told him, among other things, that her Lady&s;hip had many years ago approved of them." &mdash;'Who?' cried he. &mdash; Still I did not call to mind, but repeated 'Lady Elm|wood,
<PB N="196" REF="197">
Sir, while you were abroad' &mdash; As &s;oon as the&s;e words were delivered, I &s;aw my doom in his looks, and he commanded me to quit his hou&s;e and &s;ervice that in&s;tant."</P>
<P>"I am afraid," &s;aid Sandford, &s;itting down, "I can do nothing for you."</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, you know you have more power over my Lord than any body&mdash; and perhaps you may be able to &s;ave me and all mine from mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>"I would if I could." replied Sand|ford quickly.</P>
<P>"You can but try, Sir."</P>
<P>Matilda was all this while drowned in tears; nor Mi&s;s Woodley much le&s;s af|fected&mdash;Lady Elmwood was before their eyes &mdash; Matilda beheld her in her dying moments; Mi&s;s Woodley &s;aw her, as the gay ward of Dorriforth.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">"A&s;k Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Sand|ford, "prevail on him to &s;peak; he has more power than I have."</P>
<P>"He has not enough, then," replied Edwards, "for he was in the room with my Lord when what I have told you happened."</P>
<P>"And did he &s;ay nothing? a&s;ked Sandford.</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir; he offered to &s;peak in my behalf, but my Lord interrupted him, and ordered him out of the room &mdash; he in&s;tantly went.</P>
<P>Sandford now ob&s;erving the effect which this narration had on the two la|dies, led the man to his own apartments, and there a&s;&s;ured him he dur&s;t not un|dertake his cau&s;e; but that if time or chance &s;hould happily make an alteration in his Lord&s;hip's dipo&s;ition, he would
<PB N="198" REF="199">
be the fir&s;t to try to replace him. &mdash; Ed|wards was obliged to &s;ubmit; and before the next day at noon, his plea&s;ant hou&s;e by the &s;ide of the park, his garden, and his orchard, which he had occupied above twenty years, were cleared of their old inhabitant, and all his wretched family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THIS melancholy incident perhaps affected Matilda and all the friends of the decea&s;ed Lady Elmwood, beyond any other that had occurred &s;ince her death. &mdash; A few days after this cir|cum&s;tance, Mi&s;s Woodley, in order to divert the di&s;con&s;olate mind of Lady Matilda, (and perhaps bring her &s;ome little anecdotes, to con&s;ole her for that which had given her &s;o much pain) waited upon Lord Elmwood in his li|brary, and borrowed &s;ome books out of it.&mdash;He was now perfectly well from his fall, and received her with the &s;ame politene&s;s as u&s;ual, but, of cour&s;e, not with that particular warmth he had re|ceived
<PB N="200" REF="201">
her ju&s;t after his illne&s;s. &mdash; Ru&s;h|brook was in the library at the &s;ame time; he &s;hewed to her &s;everal beautiful prints which his Lord&s;hip had ju&s;t re|ceived from London, and appeared anxious to entertain, and give tokens of his e&s;teem and re&s;pect for her.&mdash;But what gave her plea&s;ure beyond any other attention was, that after &s;he had taken (by the aid of Ru&s;hbrook) about a do|zen volumes from different &s;helves, and had laid them together, &s;aying &s;he would &s;end her &s;ervant to fetch them, Lord Elmwood went eagerly to the place where they were, and taking up each book, examined attentively what it was.&mdash; One author he complained was too light, another too depre&s;&s;ing, and put them on the &s;helves again; another was erro|neous and he changed it for a better; and thus he warned her again&s;t &s;ome,
<PB N="201" REF="202">
and &s;elected other authors; as the mo&s;t cautious preceptor culls for his pupil, or a fond father for his darling child.&mdash;She thanked him for his attention to her, but her heart thanked him for his attention to his daughter.&mdash;For as &s;he her&s;elf had never received &s;uch a proof of his care &s;ince all their long acquaintance, &s;he rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed Matilda's reading, and not hers, was the object of his &s;oli|citude.</P>
<P>Having in the&s;e books &s;tore of com|fort for poor Matilda, &s;he eagerly return|ed with them; and in reciting every particular circum&s;tance, made her con|&s;ider the volumes almo&s;t like pre&s;ents from her father.</P>
<P>The month of September was now arrived, and Lord Elmwood, accom|panied by Ru&s;hbrook, went to a &s;mall
<PB N="202" REF="203">
&s;hooting &s;eat, about twenty miles di&s;|tant from Elmwood Ca&s;tle, for a week's particular &s;port. &mdash; Matilda was once more at large; and one beautiful fore|noon, about eleven o'clock, &s;eeing Mi&s;s Woodley walking on the lawn before the hou&s;e, &s;he ha&s;tily took her hat to join her; and not waiting to put it on, went nimbly down the great &s;tairca&s;e with it hanging on her arm.&mdash;When &s;he had de&s;cended a few &s;tairs, &s;he heard a foot&s;tep walking &s;lowly up; and, (from what emotion &s;he could not tell,) &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, half re&s;olved to return back. &mdash;She he&s;itated a &s;ingle in&s;tant which to do &mdash; then went a few &s;teps farther till &s;he came to the &s;econd landing place; when, by the &s;udden winding of the &s;tairca&s;e,&mdash;Lord Elmwood was immedi|ately before her!</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">She had felt &s;omething like affright be|fore &s;he &s;aw him&mdash;but her rea&s;on told her &s;he had nothing to fear, as he was far away.&mdash;But now the appearance of a &s;tran|ger whom &s;he had never before &s;een; an air of authority in his looks as well as in the &s;ound of his &s;teps; a re&s;emblance to the portrait &s;he had &s;een of him; a &s;tart of a&s;toni&s;hment which he gave on behold|ing her; but above all &mdash; her <HI>fears</HI> con|firmed her it was him. &mdash; She gave a &s;cream of terror&mdash;put out her trembling hands to catch the balu&s;trades on the &s;tairs for &s;upport&mdash;mi&s;&s;ed them&mdash;and fell motionle&s;s into her father's arms.</P>
<P>He caught her, as by that impul&s;e he would have caught any other per&s;on falling for want of aid. &mdash; Yet when he found her in his arms, he &s;till held her
<PB N="204" REF="205">
there &mdash; gazed on her attentively &mdash; and once pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At length, trying to e&s;cape the &s;nare into which he had been led, he was going to leave her on the &s;pot where &s;he fell, when her eyes opened and &s;he ut|tered, "Save me." &mdash; Her voice un|manned him.&mdash;His long-re&s;trained tears now bur&s;t forth &mdash; and &s;eeing her relap&s;|ing into the &s;woon again, he cried out eagerly to recall her. &mdash; Her name did not however come to his recollection &mdash; nor any name but this&mdash;"Mi&s;s Milner&mdash; Dear Mi&s;s Milner."</P>
<P>That &s;ound did not awake her; and now again he wi&s;hed to leave her in this &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tate, that not remember|ing what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he might e&s;cape the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">But at this in&s;tant Giffard, with an|other &s;ervant, pa&s;&s;ed by the foot of the &s;tairs; on which, Lord Elmwood called to them &mdash; and into Giffard's hands deli|vered his apparently dead child; with|out one command re&s;pecting her, or one word of any kind; while his face was agitated with &s;hame, with pity, with anger, with paternal tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>As Giffard &s;tood trembling, while he relieved his Lord from this haple&s;s bur|then; his Lord&s;hip had to unloo&s;e her hand from the &s;ide of his coat, which &s;he had caught fa&s;t hold of as &s;he fell, and gra&s;ped &s;o clo&s;ely, it was with diffi|culty relea&s;ed. &mdash; On taking the hand away his Lord&s;hip trembled&mdash;faltered&mdash; then bade Giffard do it.</P>
<P>"Who, I, my Lord, I &s;eparate you?" cried he. &mdash; But recollecting him&s;elf,
<PB N="206" REF="207">
"My Lord, I will obey your commands whatever they are." And &s;eizing her hand, pulled it with violence&mdash;it fell&mdash; and her father went away.</P>
<P>Matilda was carried to her own apart|ments, laid upon the bed, and Mi&s;s Woodley called to attend her, after li&s;tening to the recital of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When Lady Elmwood's old and af|fectionate friend entered the room, and &s;aw her youthful charge lying pale and &s;peechle&s;s, yet no father by to comfort or &s;ooth her, &s;he lifted up her hands to heaven exclaiming, with a flood of tears, "And is this the end of thee, my poor child? &mdash; Is this the end of all our hopes? &mdash; of thy own fearful hopes &mdash;
<PB N="207" REF="208">
and of thy mother's &s;upplications? &mdash; Oh! Lord Elmwood! Lord Elmwood!"</P>
<P>"At that name Matilda &s;tarted, and cried, "Where is he? &mdash; Is it a dream, or have I &s;een him?"</P>
<P>"It is all a dream, my dear." &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"And yet I thought he held me in his arms," &s;he replied &mdash; "I thought I felt his hands pre&s;s mine&mdash;Let me &s;leep and dream it again."</P>
<P>Now thinking it be&s;t to undeceive her, "It is no dream, my dear." re|turned Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Is it not?" cried &s;he, &s;tarting up and leaning on her elbow &mdash;"Then I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t go away &mdash; go for ever away."&mdash;</P>
<P>Sandford now entered.&mdash;Having been told the news he came to condole&mdash;But
<PB N="208" REF="209">
at the &s;ight of him Matilda was terrified, and cried, "Do not reproach me, do not upbraid me &mdash; I know I have done wrong&mdash;I know I had but one command from my father, and that I have di&s;|obeyed."</P>
<P>Sandford could not reproach her, for he could not &s;peak;&mdash;he therefore only walked to the window and concealed his tears.</P>
<P>That whole day and night was pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ympathetic grief, in alarm at every &s;ound, le&s;t it &s;hould be a me&s;&s;enger to pronounce Matilda's de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood did not &s;tay upon this vi&s;it above three hours at Elmwood Hou&s;e; he then &s;et off again for the &s;eat he had left; where Ru&s;hbrook &s;till remained, and from whence his Lord&s;hip
<PB N="209" REF="210">
had merely come by accident, to look over &s;ome writings he wanted di&s;patched to town.</P>
<P>During his &s;hort continuance here, Sandford cautiou&s;ly avoided his pre|&s;ence; for he thought, in a ca&s;e like this, what nature would not of her&s;elf do, no art, no arguments of his could effect&mdash;and to nature and to providence he left the whole.&mdash;What the&s;e two powerful principles brought about, the reader mu&s;t judge, on peru&s;ing the fol|lowing letter, received early the next morning by Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
