Of the &s;everal authors who have written on Epic Poetry, many of the mo&s;t celebrated are more likely to confound and depre&s;s, than to enlighten and exalt the young Poetical Student. The Poetics of Scaliger, which are little more than a laboured panegyric of Virgil, would lead him to regard the Aeneid as the only &s;tandard of perfection; and the more elegant and ac|compli&s;hed Vida inculcates the &s;ame pu&s;illanimous le&s;&s;on, though in &s;pirited and harmonious ver&s;e.</P>

<BIBL>PITT's Tran&s;lation.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A Critic, who lately ro&s;e to great eminence in our own country, has endeavoured by a more &s;ingular method to damp the ardour of inven|tive Genius, and to annihilate the hopes of all who would a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of originality in this higher &s;pecies of poetical compo&s;ition. He has attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h a Triumvirate in the Epic world, with a perpetuity of dominion. Every reader who is conver&s;ant with modern critici&s;m will perceive that I allude to the following pa&s;&s;age in the fa|mous Di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ixth Book of Virgil:&mdash;"Ju&s;t as Virgil ri|valled Homer, &s;o Milton emulated both of them. He found Ho|mer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the province of Morality; Virgil of Politics; and nothing left for him but that of Religion. This he &s;eized, as a&s;piring to &s;hare with them in the government of the Poetic world: and, by means of the &s;uperior dignity of his &s;ubject, hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate, which took &s;o many ages in forming. the&s;e are the three &s;pecies of the Epic Poem; for its large&s;t &s;phere is <HI>human action,</HI> which can be con&s;idered but in a <HI>moral,</HI> political, or religious view: and the&s;e the three <HI>Makers</HI>; for each of their Poems was &s;truck out at a heat, and came to perfection from its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay. Here then the grand &s;cene was clo&s;ed, and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end."</P>
<P>I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> (to u&s;e the favourite expre&s;&s;ion of the author I have quoted) than the preceding lines. Surely Milton is him&s;elf a proof that <HI>human action</HI> is not the large&s;t &s;phere of the Epic Poem; and as to Virgil, his mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate admirers mu&s;t allow, that in &s;ubject and de&s;ign he is much le&s;s of an original than Camoens or Lucan. But &s;uch a critical &s;tatute of limita|tion, if I may call it &s;o, is not le&s;s pernicious than ab&s;urd. To di&s;|figure the &s;phere of Imagination with the&s;e capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to &s;cience. Such Critici&s;m, in&s;tead of giving &s;pirit
<PB N="121" REF="120">
and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet, can only lead him to &s;tart like Macbeth at unreal mockery, and to exclaim, when he is invited by Genius to the banquet, "The Table's full."</P>

<Q><L>Thus, at their banquets, fabling Greeks rehear&s;e</L>
<L>The fancied origin of &s;acred Ver&s;e.]</L></Q>
<P>For this fable, &s;uch as it is, I am indebted to a pa&s;&s;age in Athenaeus, which the curious reader may find in the clo&s;e of that fanciful and entertaining compiler, page 701 of Ca&s;aubon's edition.</P>

<Q><L>Why did the Epic Mu&s;e's &s;ilent lyre</L>
<L>Shrink from tho&s;e feats that &s;ummon'd all her fire?]</L></Q>
<P>I have ventured to &s;uppo&s;e that Greece produced no worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Homer, and that her exploits again&s;t the Per&s;ians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner &s;uitable to &s;o &s;ublime a &s;ubject;&mdash;yet an author named Chaerilus is &s;aid to have recorded tho&s;e triumphs of his country in ver&s;e, and to have plea&s;ed the Athenians &s;o highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a cotemporary of the hi&s;torian Herodotus. But from the general &s;ilence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet, we may, I think, very fairly conjecture that his compo&s;itions were not many degrees &s;u|perior to tho&s;e of his unfortunate name&s;ake, who frequented the court of Alexander the Great, and is &s;aid to have &s;ung the exploits of his Sove|reign, on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good ver&s;e, and a box on the ear for every bad one. The old Scholia&s;t on Horace, who has pre&s;erved this idle &s;tory, concludes it by &s;aying, that the mi&s;erable Bard was beat to death in con&s;equence of his contract. Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be confounded, both by Horace him&s;elf, and afterwards by Scaliger, with the Chaerilus rewarded by Alexander. Vo&s;&s;ius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Hi&s;toricis Graecis.</NOTE>, in particular, appears a warm advo|cate in his behalf, and appeals to various fragments of the ancient Bard
<PB N="122" REF="121">
pre&s;erved by Ari&s;totle, Strabo, and others, and to the te&s;timony of Plu|tarch in his favour. But on con&s;ulting the fragments he has referred to, they rather fortify than remove my conjecture. The &s;crap pre&s;erved by Ari&s;totle in his Rhetoric is only half a ver&s;e, and quoted without any commendation of its author. The two citations in Strabo amount to little more. The curious reader may al&s;o find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus, attributed to this Poet; who is mentioned by the &s;ame author as peculiarly addicted to the gro&s;&s;er exce&s;&s;es of the table.&mdash;Let us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has "damn'd to everla&s;ting fame." The judicious and elegant Roman Satiri&s;t &s;eems remarkably un|ju&s;t, in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron Au|gu&s;tus, at the expence of the Macedonian hero. Alexander appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much more poetical &s;pirit, and a higher reli&s;h for poetry, than the cold-blooded Octavius. It is peculiarly unfair, to urge his li|berality to a poor Poet as a proof that he wanted critical di&s;cernment, when he had him&s;elf &s;o thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his ta&s;te, by the enthu&s;ia&s;tic Bon-mot, that he had rather be the Ther&s;ites of Homer than the Achilles of Chaerilus.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE IV. VERSE 231.</HEAD>
<Q><L>When grave Bo&s;&s;u by Sy&s;tem's &s;tudied laws</L>
<L>The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws.]</L></Q>
<P>Though Bo&s;&s;u is called "the be&s;t explainer of Ari&s;totle, and one of the mo&s;t learned and judicious of modern critics," by a writer for who&s;e opinions I have much e&s;teem, I cannot help thinking that his celebrated E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to in&s;pirit a young Poet. The ab&s;urdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable, by chu&s;ing a moral, inventing the incidents, and then &s;earching hi&s;tory for names to &s;uit them, has been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed: and as to his leading idea, concerning the de&s;ign of Homer in the compo&s;ition of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey, I apprehend mo&s;t poetical readers mu&s;t feel that he is pro|bably mi&s;taken; for it is a conjectural point, and placed beyond the po&s;|&s;ibility of deci&s;ion. Perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking, by the force of education and of na|tional manners, than a modern French Critic and an early Poet of Greece; yet the former will often pretend, with the mo&s;t deci&s;ive air,
<PB N="123" REF="122">
to lay open the &s;en&s;orium of an ancient Bard, and to count every link in the chain of his ideas. Tho&s;e who are mo&s;t acquainted with the move|ments of imagination, will acknowledge the &s;teps of this airy power to be &s;o light and evane&s;cent in their nature, that perhaps a Poet him&s;elf, in a few years after fini&s;hing his work, might be utterly unable to recol|lect the exact train of thought, or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general de&s;ign, or directed him in the particular parts of his poem. But, in &s;pite of the interval of many hundred centuries, the deci&s;ive magic of critici&s;m can call up all the &s;hadows of departed thought that ever exi&s;ted in his brain, and di&s;play, with a mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing clearne&s;s, the preci&s;e &s;tate of his mind in the moment of com|po&s;ition.</P>

<P>The preceding remarks of this celebrated Critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture, which mo&s;t happily illu&s;trates the real purpo&s;e of Homer.

<P>There is a &s;triking pa&s;&s;age on this &s;ubject in a dialogue of Plato, which I &s;hall enlarge upon, for two rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, As it proves that the latter per&s;ua&s;ion concerning the purpo&s;e of Homer was enter|tained at Athens; and 2dly, Becau&s;e it gives me a plea&s;ing oppor|tunity of &s;upporting the learned Madame Dacier again&s;t an ill-grounded cen&s;ure of a late Engli&s;h critic. In her Preface to the Ody&s;&s;ey, &s;he a&s;&s;erts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the Iliad; and &s;he appeals to part of the &s;entence in Plato to which I have alluded, as a proof of her a&s;&s;ertion. Mr. Wood, in a note to the Introduction of his E&s;&s;ay on Homer, endeavours to &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of this proof; and &s;till farther, to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly mi&s;|taken in her &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age to which &s;he appealed. If he ventures to contradict this learned lady, he does not however in&s;ult her with that in&s;olent pertne&s;s with which &s;he is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer; and which, for the honour of our Engli&s;h Poet, I will not &s;uppo&s;e to be his. But though Mr. Wood endeavours to &s;up|port his opinion by argument, I apprehend that he is him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in under&s;tanding the words of Socrates in their literal &s;en&s;e, without the lea&s;t mixture of irony. It is true, indeed, that the aim of Socrates, in the cour&s;e of the dialogue, is to ridicule the pre&s;umption and ignorance of the &s;ophi&s;t Hippias, in the
<PB N="125" REF="124">
mo&s;t ironical manner; but the particular &s;peech on Which Madame Dacier founds her opinion, is a plain and &s;imple addre&s;s to Eudicus, be|fore he enters on his debate with the Sophi&s;t. It turns on the mo&s;t &s;imple circum&s;tance, the truth of which Eudicus could hardly be ig|norant of, namely, the &s;entiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer. As the&s;e &s;entiments are &s;uch as I believe mo&s;t ad|mirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in que&s;tion, I perfectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and &s;erious, when he &s;ays to Eudicus, <GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>Let us now return to Bo&s;&s;u; who&s;e opinion concerning the purpo&s;e of Homer we may venture to oppo&s;e, &s;upported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of &s;ome ambiguous pa&s;&s;ages in the Poetics of Ari&s;totle; and this oppo&s;ition may be grounded, not &s;o much on the &s;entence which I have quoted from Plato, as on the probable conduct of Epic compo|&s;ition in the early ages of poetry. In &s;uch periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden, when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly under&s;tood, we can ea&s;ily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the ma&s;k of &s;uch heroic names as hi&s;tory could &s;upply, and their genius accommodate to their purpo&s;e. We find accordingly, that the Roman Bard is &s;uppo&s;ed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas, and that the Engli&s;h Poet has, with equal ingenuity, enwrapt the di&s;&s;olute Charles the Second in the Jewi&s;h robes of King David. But in &s;o rude an age as we mu&s;t admit that of Homer to have been; when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art; when he had no hi&s;tory to con&s;ult, perhaps no patron to flatter, and no critics
<PB N="126" REF="125">
to elude or obey; in &s;uch an age, may we not more naturally conjecture, that poetical compo&s;ition was neither laboured in its form, nor deep in its de&s;ign? that, in&s;tead of being the &s;low and &s;y&s;tematic product of po|litical rea&s;oning, it was the quick and artle&s;s offspring of a &s;trong and vivifying fancy, which, brooding over the tales of tradition, &s;oon rai&s;ed them into &s;uch life and beauty, as mu&s;t &s;atisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience, ever ready to li&s;ten with delight to the heroic feats of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>If the learned Bo&s;&s;u appears unfortunate in his &s;y&s;tem concerning the purpo&s;e of Homer, he may be thought &s;till more &s;o in his attempt to analyze the Divinities of Virgil; for, to throw new light on the conven|tion of the Gods, in the opening of the tenth Aeneid, he very &s;eriou&s;ly informs us, that "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book v. chap.

<P>I cannot conclude the&s;e very free &s;trictures on a celebrated author, without bearing a plea&s;ing te&s;timony to the virtues of the man.&mdash;Bo&s;&s;u is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the milde&s;t manners and mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition; totally free from that imperious and bigotted attachment to &s;peculative opinions, which the &s;cience he cultivated is &s;o apt to produce.

<P>As it requires much lei&s;ure to examine, and more &s;kill to unravel an intricate hypothe&s;is, twi&s;ted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argument, the Di&s;&s;erta|tion on the &s;ixth Book of Virgil remained for &s;ome time unrefuted. The public very quietly acquie&s;ced in the &s;trange po&s;ition of its author, "That Aeneas's adventure to the infernal &s;hades, is no other than a figurative de&s;cription of his initiation into the My&s;teries; and particu|larly a very exact one of the &s;pectacles of the Eleu&s;inian."

"It is," &s;ays he, "from extrin&s;ical circum&s;tances that we may expect the di&s;covery of Virgil's allegory.

the re&s;earches, or wanted the applau&s;e, of a learned and judicious fo|reigner. Profe&s;&s;or Heyne, the late accurate and accompli&s;hed Editor of Virgil, has mentioned it, in his Comments to the &s;ixth Book of the Aeneid, with the honour it de&s;erves.

The fate of Warburton is a &s;triking in&s;tance of this impor|tant truth. What havock has the cour&s;e of very few years produced in that pile of imperious critici&s;m which he had heaped together! Many of his notes on Shake&s;peare have already re&s;igned their place to the &s;uperior comments of more accompli&s;hed Critics; and perhaps the day is not far di&s;tant, when the volumes of Pope him&s;elf will cea&s;e to be a repo&s;itory for the lumber of his friend. The &s;evere&s;t enemies of Warburton mu&s;t indeed allow, that &s;everal of his remarks on his Poeti|cal Patron are entitled to pre&s;ervation, by their u&s;e or beauty; but the greater part, I apprehend, are equally de&s;titute of both: and how far the Critic was capable of di&s;gracing the Poet, mu&s;t be evident to every reader who recollects that the non&s;en&s;e in the E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, where

I &s;hall therefore hazard a few farther ob&s;ervations, not only on this famous Critic of our age and country, but on the two greater names of antiquity, to each of whom he has been declared &s;uperior by the partial voice of enthu&s;ia&s;tic friend&s;hip. I wi&s;h not to offend his mo&s;t zealous adherents; and, though I cannot but con&s;ider him as a literary u&s;urper, I &s;peak of him as a great Hi&s;torian &s;aid of more exalted tyrants, &s;ine ira et &s;tudio, quorum cau&s;as procul habeo.&mdash;There &s;eem to be three natural endowments requi&s;ite in the formation of an accompli&s;hed critic;&mdash;&s;trong under&s;tanding, lively imagination, and refined &s;en&s;ibility. The fir&s;t was the characteri&s;tic of Ari&s;totle, and by the con&s;ent of all ages he is al|lowed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in a &s;uperlative degree. May I be pardoned for the opinion, that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the <HI>other two?</HI> I would not ab&s;olutely &s;ay that he had neither Fancy nor Feeling; but that his imagination was <HI>not brilliant,</HI> and that his &s;en&s;ibility was not exqui&s;ite, may I think be fairly pre&s;umed from the general tenor of his pro&s;e; nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea. The two qualities in which Ari&s;totle may be &s;uppo&s;ed defective, were the very two which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h Longinus; who certainly wanted not under&s;tanding, though he might not po&s;&s;e&s;s the philo&s;ophi|cal
<PB N="133" REF="132">
&s;agacity of the Stagyrite. When con&s;idered in every point of view, he appears the mo&s;t con&s;ummate character among the Critics of anti|quity. If Warburton wore any re&s;emblance to either of the&s;e mighty names, I apprehend it mu&s;t be to the former, and perhaps in imagina|tion he was &s;uperior to Ari&s;totle; but, of the three qualities which I have ventured to con&s;ider as requi&s;ite in the perfect Critic, I conceive him to have been mi&s;erably deficient in the la&s;t, and certainly the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of the three; for, as the great Commentator of Horace has phi|lo&s;ophically and truly remarked, in a note to that Poet, "Feeling, or Sentiment, is not only the &s;ure&s;t, but the &s;ole ultimate arbiter of works of genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, ver. 210.</NOTE>." A man may po&s;&s;e&s;s an acute under&s;tanding and a lively imagination, without being a &s;ound Critic; and this truth perhaps can|not be more clearly &s;hewn than in the writings of Warburton. His under&s;tanding was undoubtedly acute, his imagination was lively; but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means &s;ynonymous; and he cer|tainly wanted tho&s;e finer feelings which con&s;titute accuracy of di&s;cern|ment, and a perfect perception of literary excellence. In con&s;equence of this defect, in&s;tead of &s;eizing the real &s;en&s;e and intended beauties of an author, he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy, which led him in que&s;t of &s;ecret meanings and my&s;terious allu&s;ions; the&s;e he readily found, and his powers of under&s;tanding enabled him to dre&s;s them up in a plau&s;ible and &s;pecious form, and to per&s;uade many readers that he was (what he believed him&s;elf to be) the re&s;torer of ge|nuine Critici&s;m. As a farther proof that he was de&s;titute of refined &s;en|&s;ibility, I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction, which, as Dr. John&s;on has very ju&s;tly remarked, is coar&s;e and impure. Perhaps it may be found, that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I &s;uppo&s;e him to have wanted, they have been more or le&s;s di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the ea&s;e, the elegance, and the beauty of their language: were I required to fortify this conjecture by examples, I &s;hould produce the names of Virgil and Racine, of Fenelon and Addi&s;on&mdash;that Addi|&s;on, who, though in&s;ulted by the Commentator of Pope with the names of an indifferent Poet and a wor&s;e Critic, was, I think, as much &s;uperior to his in&s;ulter in critical ta&s;te, and in &s;olidity of judgment, as he con|fe&s;&s;edly

<P>The&s;e, and the &s;ix &s;ub&s;e|quent lines, allude to the following pa&s;&s;age in Dr. Warton's E&s;&s;ay on Pope. "I conclude the&s;e reflections with a remarkable fact. In no poli&s;hed nation, after Critici&s;m has been much &s;tudied, and the rules of writ|ing e&s;tabli&s;hed, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has vi&s;ibly been the ca&s;e in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Ari&s;totle, Horace, and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry. In our own country, the rules of the Drama, for in&s;tance, were never more com|pletely under&s;tood than at pre&s;ent; yet what unintere&s;ting, though faultle&s;s, Tragedies have we lately &s;een? &s;o much better is our judgment than our execution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, ade|quately and ju&s;tly, would be attended with all tho&s;e difficulties that await di&s;cu&s;&s;ions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and &s;ecret cau&s;es that influence them; whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and cau|tion which is occa&s;ioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art; or whe|ther that philo&s;ophical, that geometrical, and &s;y&s;tematical &s;pirit &s;o much in vogue, which has &s;pread it&s;elf from the &s;ciences even into polite lite|rature, by con&s;ulting only <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> has not dimini&s;hed and de&s;troyed <HI>&s;en|timent,</HI> and made our poets write from and to the <HI>head,</HI> rather than the heart; or whether, la&s;tly, when ju&s;t models, from which the rules have nece&s;&s;arily been drawn, have once appeared, &s;ucceeding writers, by vainly and ambitiou&s;ly &s;triving to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e ju&s;t models, and to &s;hine and &s;urpri&s;e, do not become &s;tiff and forced, and affected in their thoughts and diction." Warton's E&s;&s;ay, page 209, 3d edition.&mdash;I admire this ingenious and mode&s;t rea&s;oning; but, for the honour of that &s;everer art, which this plea&s;ing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embelli&s;h, I will venture to &s;tart &s;ome doubts concerning the fact it&s;elf for which he endeavours to account. Perhaps our acquaintance with tho&s;e writ|ings of Greece and Rome, which were &s;ub&s;equent to Ari&s;totle and Ho|race, is not &s;ufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in re&s;pect
<PB N="135" REF="134">
to tho&s;e countries. But with regard to France, may we not a&s;&s;ert, that her poetical productions, which aro&s;e after the publication of Boileau's Didactic E&s;&s;ay, are at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;uperior, to tho&s;e which pre|ceded that period? If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem, it is allowed to be the be&s;t which the French have to boa&s;t; not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and univer&s;al author. If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true, I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e it to ari&s;e from the irritable nature of the poetic &s;pirit, &s;o peculiarly aver&s;e to re&s;traint and controul. The Bard who could gallop his Pega&s;us over a free and open plain, might be eager to engage in &s;o plea&s;ing an exerci&s;e; but he who ob&s;erved the direction-po&s;ts &s;o thickly and &s;o per|ver&s;ely planted, that, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his career, they mu&s;t probably occa&s;ion his fall, would ea&s;ily be tempted to de&s;cend from his &s;teed, and to decline the cour&s;e. Let me illu&s;trate this conjecture by a &s;triking fact, in the very words of the Poet ju&s;t mentioned, who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence, and who has left us the following anec|dote of him&s;elf, in that plea&s;ing little anonymous work entitled, Com|mentaire Hi&s;torique &s;ur les Oeuvres de l' Auteur de la Henriade. "Il lut un jour plu&s;ieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Pr&eacute;&s;ident de Mai&s;ons, &s;on intime ami. On l'impatienta par des objections; il jetta &s;on manu&s;crit dans le feu. Le Pr&eacute;&s;ident H&eacute;naut l'en retira avec peine. "Souvenez vous (lui dit Mr. H&eacute;naut) dans une de &s;es lettres, que c'e&s;t moi qui ai &s;auv&eacute; la Henriade, et qu'il m'en a cout&eacute; une belle paire de manchettes."</P>
<P>To return to the E&s;&s;ay on Pope.&mdash;I rejoice that the amiable Critic has at length obliged the public with the conclu&s;ion of his mo&s;t engaging and ingenious work: he has the &s;ingular talent to in&s;truct and to plea&s;e even tho&s;e readers who are mo&s;t ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h; and he has in &s;ome degree atoned for that exce&s;s of &s;everity which his fir&s;t volume di&s;covered, and which &s;unk the reputation of Pope in the eyes of many, who judge not for them&s;elves, even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it. Had Pope been alive, to add this &s;pirited e&s;&s;ay to the bundle of writ|ings again&s;t him&s;elf which he is &s;aid to have collected, he mu&s;t have felt, that, like the dagger of Brutus, it gave the mo&s;t painful blow, from the character of the a&s;&s;ailant:

There is nothing in Boileau's admirable Didactic E&s;&s;ay &s;o liable to ob|jection as the whole pa&s;&s;age concerning Epic poetry. His patronage of the old Pagan divinities, and his oblique recommendation of Cla&s;&s;ical heroes, are alike exceptionable. Even a higher name than Boileau has failed in framing precepts for the Epic Mu&s;e. The maxims delivered by Ta&s;&s;o him&s;elf, in his Di&s;cour&s;e on Epic poetry, are &s;o far from perfect, that an agreeable and judicious French critic has very ju&s;tly &s;aid of him, "S'il e&ucirc;t mis &s;a theorie en pratique, &s;on poeme n'auroit pas tant de charmes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marmontel Poetique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e.</NOTE>." I am not &s;o vain as to think of &s;ucceeding in the point where the&s;e immortal authors have failed; and I mu&s;t beg my reader to remember, that the pre&s;ent work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the Epic poet; it is not my de&s;ign
<Q>To write receipts how poems may be made.</Q>

If my e&s;&s;ay &s;hould excite that gene|rous enthu&s;ia&s;m in the brea&s;t of any young poetic genius, &s;o far from wi&s;hing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination, I &s;hould rather &s;ay to him, in the words of Dante's Virgil,

<P>Parthenius, &s;ay the Commentators, was a di&s;ciple of Diony&s;ius of Alexandria, who flouri&s;hed under Nero and Trajan. Erycius, the author of the in&s;cription, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived in the &s;ame age. Among the modern adver&s;aries of Homer, the French are mo&s;t remarkable for their &s;everity and inju&s;tice: nor is it &s;urpri&s;ing, that the nation which has di&s;played the fainte&s;t &s;parks of Epic fire, &s;hould be the mo&s;t &s;olici|tous to reduce the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;plendor of this exalted luminary. The mo&s;t depreciating remarks on genius, in every walk, are generally made by tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t able to prove its rivals; and often, perhaps, not &s;o much from the prevalence of envious malignity, as from the want of vivid and delicate perception. The merits and the failings of Homer were agitated in France with all the heat and acrimony of a theological di&s;pute. Madame Dacier di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf in the conte&s;t by her uncommon talents and erudition: &s;he combated for the Grecian Bard with the &s;pirit of Minerva defending the Father of the Gods. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;t, that &s;he &s;ometimes over&s;tepped the mode&s;ty of wi&s;dom, and caught, unwarily, the &s;colding tone of Juno. It is indeed amu&s;ing, to ob&s;erve a people, who pique them&s;elves on their extreme po|litene&s;s, and cen&s;ure Homer for the gro&s;s behaviour of his Gods, engag|ing among them&s;elves in a &s;quabble concerning this very Poet, with all the unrefined animo&s;ity of his Olympian Synod. In the whole contro|ver&s;y there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of prai&s;e, than the lively elegance and the plea&s;ing good-humour of Mr. de la Motte, who, though not one of the mo&s;t exalted, was certainly one of the mo&s;t amiable, characters in the literary world; and made a generous return to the &s;everity of his female antagoni&s;t, by writing an ode in her prai&s;e.
<PB N="141" REF="140">
Voltaire has pointed out, with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad; but he has frequently fallen him&s;elf into &s;imilar defects, and is equally unju&s;t to Homer, again&s;t whom he has levelled the mo&s;t bitter &s;arca&s;ms, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e. Voltaire at|tacking Homer, is like Paris &s;hooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles: the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors; yet Homer, like Achilles, may have his vulnerable &s;pot; but with this happy dif|ference, that although the &s;haft of ridicule, which is pointed again&s;t him, may be tinged with venom, its wound cannot be mortal. Perhaps no better an&s;wer can be made to all tho&s;e who amu&s;e them&s;elves with writing again&s;t Homer, than the following reply of Madame Dacier to the Abb&eacute; Terra&s;&s;on, who had attacked her favourite Bard in two abu&s;ive volumes:&mdash;"Que Mon&s;ieur l'Abb&eacute; Terra&s;&s;on trouve Homere &s;ot, ridi|cule, extravagant, ennuyeux, c'e&s;t &s;on affaire, le public jugera &s;i c'e&s;t un defaut &agrave; Homere de deplaire &agrave; M. l'Abb&eacute; Terra&s;&s;on, ou &agrave; M. l'Abb&eacute; Terra&s;&s;on de ne pas gouter Homere."</P>

Apollonius was a di&s;ciple of the poet Callimachus; but their connection ended in the mo&s;t violent enmity, which was probably owing to &s;ome degree of contempt expre&s;&s;ed by Apollonius for the light compo&s;itions of his ma&s;ter. The learned have vainly endeavoured to di&s;cover the particulars of their quarrel.&mdash; The only Work of Apol|lonius which has de&s;cended to modern times, is his Poem, in four Books, on the Argonautic expedition. Both Longinus and Quintilian have a&s;&s;igned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity; but there lies an appeal from the &s;entence of the mo&s;t candid and en|lightened Critics to the voice of Nature; and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the deci&s;ion of this ultimate judge. His Poem abounds in animated de&s;cription, and in pa&s;&s;ages of the mo&s;t ten|der and pathetic beauty. How finely painted is the fir&s;t &s;etting forth of the Argo! and how beautifully is the wife of Chiron introduced, holding up the little Achilles in her arms, and &s;hewing him to his father Peleus as he &s;ailed along the &s;hore! But the chief excellence in our Poet, is the &s;pirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the pa&s;&s;ion of love in his Medea. That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is &s;ufficiently evident from the minute exactne&s;s with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet. Tho&s;e who compare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil, may, I think, perceive not only that Dido has &s;ome features of Medea, but that the two Bards, however different in their reputation, re&s;embled each other in their genius; and that they both excel in deli|cacy and pathos.</P>

<P>Scaliger appears to be the mo&s;t extravagant of all the Critics who have lavi&s;hed their undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing encomiums on Virgil, by a&s;&s;erting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet. Poetices, lib. iii. c. 2. &mdash; Though the opinion of Spence, and other modern Critics, concerning the character of Aeneas, con&s;idered as an allegorical portrait of Augu&s;tus, &s;eems to gain ground, yet it might perhaps be ea&s;y to overturn the ingenious conjectures
<PB N="144" REF="143">
and the fanciful rea&s;oning by which that idea has been &s;upported. This attempt would have the &s;anction of one of the mo&s;t judicious Commentators of Virgil; for the learned Heyne expre&s;sly rejects all allegorical interpretation, and thinks it improbable that a Poet of &s;o correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contract and cramp his powers. He even ventures to a&s;&s;ert, that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of Augu&s;tus, the execution of it is unhappy. The &s;tronge&s;t argument which has been adduced to &s;upport this conjecture, is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following pa&s;&s;age in the opening of the third Georgic:
<Q><L>Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita &s;uper&s;it,</L>
<L>Aonio rediens deducam vertice Mu&s;as:</L>

<P>The&s;e lines, in which Virgil expre&s;&s;es his intention of dedicating a temple to Augu&s;tus, have been con&s;idered as the <HI>noble&s;t allegory of ancient Poetry</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hurd's Horace, vol.ii. page 44.</NOTE>; and the great Critic who fir&s;t &s;tarted the idea, has expatiated, in the triumph of his di&s;covery, on the <HI>my&s;terious</HI> beauties they contain: but the whole of this hypothe&s;is is unfortunately built upon the rejec|tion of three ver&s;es, which are pronounced unworthy of the Poet, and which, though found in every MS. the Critic claims a right of re|moving. A licence &s;o extraordinary cannot even be ju&s;tified by the talents of this accompli&s;hed writer; for if the le&s;s elegant pa&s;&s;ages of the ancient Poets might be removed at plea&s;ure, their compo&s;itions would be expo&s;ed to the caprice of every fanta&s;tic commentator. The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unne|ce&s;&s;ary, but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the man|ners

of his age. The cu&s;tom of erecting real temples was &s;o familiar to antiquity, that a Roman would never have &s;u&s;pected the edifice was to be rai&s;ed only with poetical materials. We may even conjecture, from a line of Statius, that the Poet him&s;elf had a temple erected to his memory; and, without any breach of probability, we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor &s;uch a te&s;timony of his gra|titude. This adulation, though &s;hocking to us, was too generally ju&s;tified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction. He had before acquie&s;ced in the divinity of his Imperial Patron, and had expre&s;&s;ed the idea in its full &s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>Having made &s;uch an invocation in the beginning of his Work, was his <HI>delicacy</HI> afterwards to be &s;hocked, and oblige him to pay a compliment under the di&s;gui&s;e of an ob&s;cure conceit? for that allegory mu&s;t be allowed to be ob&s;cure, which had remained through &s;o many ages unexplained. The unfortunate rejected lines, for who&s;e elegance we do not contend, may at lea&s;t be re&s;cued from impropriety by a li|teral interpretation of the preceding pa&s;&s;age; for, di&s;mi&s;s the conjectured allegory, and the chief objections again&s;t them remain no longer. If the phra&s;eology be peculiar, it is at lea&s;t &s;upported by concurring MSS. The adjective <HI>ardens</HI> is &s;ometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a &s;ub&s;tance of heat or flame, as the Critic him&s;elf ad|mits in the ca&s;e of <HI>ardentes ho&s;tes,</HI> to which we may add the <HI>verbum ardens</HI> of Cicero.

The Poet expre&s;&s;es his intention of erecting a temple to Augu&s;tus, and expatiates on the mag|nificence with which it was to be adorned: he then returns to his pre|&s;ent poetical &s;ubject;
<Q><HI>Interea</HI> Dryadum &s;ylvas &s;altu&s;que &s;equamur:</Q>
and, having dwelt a little on that, to avoid too long a digre&s;&s;ion, very naturally re&s;umes the prai&s;es of the Emperor, by alluding to the &s;ublimer &s;ong which he intended to devote to him <HI>hereafter.</HI>

Perhaps the important po&s;ition that gave ri&s;e to this conjecture, and to others of a &s;imilar complexion, "that the propriety of allegorical com|po&s;ition made the di&s;tingui&s;hed pride of ancient poetry," is as que&s;tion|able as the conjecture it&s;elf; and a diligent and judicious peru&s;al of the ancient Poets might convince us, that &s;implicity was their genuine character, and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators. Ari&s;tarchus, indeed, the celebrated model of ancient critici&s;m, rejected with great &s;pirit the alle|gorical interpretations of Homer, as we are informed by Eu&s;thathius; but the good Archbi&s;hop of The&s;&s;alonica, who, like &s;ome modern pre|lates, had a pa&s;&s;ion for allegory, cen&s;ures the great Critic of Alexandria for his more &s;imple mode of con&s;truction, and &s;uppo&s;es it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wi&s;dom of the Poet. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>EUSTH. vol. iii. page 1300.</BIBL></Q></P>

<Q>Shall Hi&s;tory's pen, to aid his vengeance won.]</Q>
<P>There is hardly any emi|nent per&s;onage of antiquity who has &s;uffered more from detraction, both

in his literary and moral character, than the poet Lucan. His fate, indeed, &s;eems in all points to have been peculiarly &s;evere. His early death, at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work, is it&s;elf &s;ufficient to excite our compa&s;&s;ion and regret; but to peri&s;h by the envious tyranny of Nero, may be con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing, when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of Tacitus. As I am per|&s;uaded that the great Hi&s;torian has inadvertently adopted the gro&s;&s;e&s;t calumny again&s;t our Poet, I &s;hall mo&s;t readily a&s;&s;ign my rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o. It may fir&s;t be proper to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of Lucan's life.&mdash;He was the &s;on of Anneus Mela, the younge&s;t brother of Seneca; and though born at Corduba, was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months: a circum&s;tance, as his more indulgent critics ob&s;erve, which &s;ufficiently refutes the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e who con&s;ider his language as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus, &s;o warmly celebrated by his di&s;ciple Per&s;ius the Satiri&s;t, who was the in|timate friend of our Poet. In the clo&s;e of his education Lucan is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Athens. On his return to Rome he ro&s;e to the office of Quae&s;tor, before he had attained the legal age. He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs; and married a lady of noble birth, of who&s;e amiable character I &s;hall &s;peak more at large in a &s;ub&s;e|quent note. Lucan had for &s;ome time been admitted to familiarity with Nero, when the Emperor cho&s;e to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had compo&s;ed on Niobe; and &s;ome ver&s;es of this imperial production are &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;erved in the fir&s;t Satire of Per&s;ius. Lucan had the hardine&s;s to repeat a poem on Orpheus, in competition with that of Nero; and, what is more remark|able, the judges of the conte&s;t were ju&s;t and bold enough to decide again&s;t the Emperor. From hence Nero became the per&s;ecutor of his &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful rival, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public. The well-known con&s;piracy of Pi&s;o again&s;t the tyrant &s;oon followed; and Taci|tus, with his u&s;ual &s;arca&s;tic &s;everity, concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had received: a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Hi&s;torian; who might have found a much nobler, and, I will add, a more probable motive for his conduct, in the generous ardor of his character, and his pa&s;&s;ionate adora|tion
<PB N="148" REF="147">
of freedom. In the &s;equel of his narration, Tacitus alledges a charge again&s;t our Poet, which, if it were true, mu&s;t lead us to dete&s;t him as the mo&s;t abject of mankind. The Hi&s;torian a&s;&s;erts, that Lucan, when accu&s;ed of the con&s;piracy, for &s;ome time denied the charge; but; corrupted at la&s;t by a promi&s;e of impunity, and de&s;irous to atone for the tardine&s;s of his confe&s;&s;ion, accu&s;ed his mother Atilla as his accomplice. This circum&s;tance is &s;o improbable in it&s;elf, and &s;o little con&s;onant to the general character of Lucan, that &s;ome writers have treated it with contempt, as a calumny invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of Tacitus has given &s;uch an air of authority to the &s;tory, that it may &s;eem to de&s;erve a more &s;erious di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, particularly as there are two &s;ub&s;equent events related by the &s;ame Hi&s;torian, which have a tendency to invalidate the accu&s;ation &s;o injurious to our Poet. The events I mean are, the fate of Annaeus, and the e&s;cape of Atilla, the two parents of Lucan. The former died in con&s;equence of art accu&s;ation brought again&s;t him, after the death of his &s;on, by Fabius Romanus, who had been intimate with Lucan and forged &s;ome letters in his name, with the de&s;ign of proving his father concerned in the con&s;piracy. The&s;e letters were produced to Nero, who &s;ent them to Annaeus, from an eager de&s;ire, &s;ays Tacitus, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wealth. From this fact two inferences may be drawn, according to the different lights in which it may be con&s;idered:&mdash;If the accu&s;ation again&s;t Annaeus was ju&s;t, it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his fa|ther, and he appears the le&s;s likely to have endangered by his confe&s;&s;ion the life of a parent, to whom he owed a &s;till tenderer regard:&mdash;If Annaeus was not involved in the con&s;piracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the &s;ake of his trea&s;ure, we may the more readily believe, that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice, might calumniate the &s;on from envy. But the e&s;cape of Atilla affords us the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery, of which Tacitus has &s;uppo&s;ed him guilty. Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice, would the vindic|tive and &s;anguinary Nero have &s;pared the life of a woman, who&s;e family he dete&s;ted, particularly when other females were put to death for their &s;hare in the con&s;piracy? That Atilla was not in that number, the Hi&s;torian him&s;elf informs us in the following remarkable &s;entence,
<PB N="149" REF="148">
Atilla mater Annaei Lucani, &s;ine ab&s;olutione, &s;ine &s;upplicio, di&s;&s;imulata; thus tran&s;lated by Gordon: "The information again&s;t Atilla, the mo|ther of Lucan, was di&s;&s;embled; and, without being cleared, &s;he e&s;caped unpuni&s;hed."</P>
<P>The preceding remarks will, I hope, vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet; who&s;e firmne&s;s and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly di&s;played in that picture of his death which Tacitus him&s;elf has given us. I &s;hall pre&s;ent it to the Engli&s;h reader in the words of Gordon: &mdash; Lucan, "while his blood i&s;&s;ued in &s;treams, perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and &s;tiffen, and life to retire by little and little to the extremities, while his heart was &s;till beating with vital warmth, and his faculties no wi&s;e impaired, recollected &s;ome lines of his own, which de&s;cribed a wounded &s;oldier expiring in a manner that re&s;embled this. The lines them&s;elves he rehear&s;ed; and they were the la&s;t words he ever uttered." The Annals of Tacitus, Book xv. &mdash; The critics differ concerning the ver&s;es of the Phar&s;alia which the author quoted in &s;o memorable a manner. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the two pa&s;&s;ages he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have repeated, and only add that Lip&s;ius contends for the latter.</P>

<P>Such was the death of Lucan, before he had completed his twenty|&s;eventh year. If his character as a man has been injured by the Hi&s;to|rian, his poetical reputation has been treated not le&s;s injuriou&s;ly by the Critics. Quintilian, by a frivolous di&s;tinction, di&s;putes his title to be cla&s;&s;ed among the Poets; and Scaliger &s;ays, with a brutality of language di&s;graceful only to him&s;elf, that he &s;eems rather to <HI>bark</HI> than to <HI>&s;ing.</HI> But the&s;e in&s;ults may appear amply compen&s;ated, when we remember, that in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations of modern Europe the mo&s;t elevated and poetic &s;pirits have been his warme&s;t admirers; that in France he was idolized by Corneille, and in England tran&s;lated by Rowe.&mdash;The &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ures on Lucan have proceeded from tho&s;e who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil: but how unju&s;t and ab&s;urd is &s;uch a compari&s;on! it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough from the quarry, to the mo&s;t beautiful &s;uper|&s;icies of poli&s;hed marble. How differently &s;hould we think of Virgil as a poet, if we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the ver&s;es which he wrote at that period of life when Lucan compo&s;ed his Phar&s;alia! In the di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubject, in the propriety and elegance of diction, he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil: but if we attend to the bold originality of his de&s;ign, and to the vigour of his &s;entiments; if we con&s;ider the Phar&s;alia as the

<Q>Let Argentaria on your canva&s;s &s;hine.]</Q>
<P>Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Senator, and the wife of Lucan. She is &s;aid to have tran&s;cribed and corrected the three fir&s;t books of the Phar&s;alia, after the death of her hu&s;band. It is much to be regretted that we po&s;&s;e&s;s not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accompli&s;hed woman; but her name is immortalized by two &s;urviving Poets of that age. The veneration which &s;he paid to the memory of her hu&s;band, is recorded by Martial; and more poetically de&s;cribed in that plea&s;ing and elegant little production of Statius, <HI>Genethliacon Lucani,</HI> a poem which I the more readily commend, as I may be thought by &s;ome readers un|ju&s;t towards its author, in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid. I confe&s;s, indeed, the mi&s;cellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his mo&s;t va|luable work: in mo&s;t of the&s;e there is much imagination and &s;entiment, in harmonious and &s;pirited ver&s;e. The little poem which I have men|tioned, on the anniver&s;ary of Lucan's birth, is &s;aid to have been written at the reque&s;t of Argentaria. The Author, after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony, touches with great delicacy and &s;pirit on the compo&s;itions of Lucan's childhood, which are lo&s;t, and the Phar|&s;alia, the production of his early youth; he then pays a &s;hort compli|ment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria, laments the cruel fate which deprived her &s;o immaturely of dome&s;tic happine&s;s; and concludes with the following addre&s;s to the &s;hade of Lucan:

Had he been really guilty of ba&s;ely endangering the life of his mother, it is not pro|bable that his wife would have honoured his memory with &s;uch enthu|&s;ia&s;tic veneration, or that Statius, in ver&s;es de&s;igned to do him honour, would have alluded to <HI>the mother</HI> of Nero. The Reader will pardon my recurring to this &s;ubject, as it is plea&s;ing to make u&s;e of every argument which may remove &s;o odious and unju&s;t a &s;tain from a manly and exalted character.</P>

<Q>Struck with ill-fated zeal the Latian lyre.]</Q>
<P>There never was a cen|tury utterly de&s;titute of ingenious and elegant Poets, &s;ays the learned Polycarp Ley&s;er, after having patiently traced the ob&s;cure progre&s;s of Latin poetry through all the dark ages. Indeed the merit of &s;ome Latin Poets, in a period that we commonly &s;uppo&s;e involved in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t barbari&s;m, is &s;ingularly &s;triking; many of the&s;e are of the Epic kind, and, as they de&s;cribe the manners and cu&s;toms of their re&s;pective times, a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work. I &s;hall briefly mention &s;uch as appear mo&s;t worthy of notice.</P>
<P>Abbo, a Pari&s;ian monk, of the Benedictine order, wrote a poem on the &s;iege of Paris by the Normans and the Danes, at which he was pre|&s;ent, in the year 886: it is printed in the &s;econd volume of Duche&s;ne's Script.Francorum; and, though it has little or no poetical merit, may be regarded as an hi&s;torical curio&s;ity. The following lines, addre&s;&s;ed to the city of Paris, in the beginning of the work, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of its language:
<Q><L>Dic igitur praepulchra polis, quod Danea munus</L>
<L>Libavit tibimet, &s;oboles Plutonis amica,</L>
<L>Tempore quo prae&s;ul domini et dulci&s;&s;imus heros</L>
<L>Gozlinus temet pa&s;torque benignus alebat!</L>
<L>Haec inquit, miror, narrare pote&s;t aliqui&s;ne?</L>
<L>Nonne tuis idem vidi&s;ti oculis? refer ergo:</L>
<L>Vidi equidem, ju&s;&s;i&s;que tuis parebo libenter.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ley&s;er has confounded this Poet with another of this name; but Fa|bricius has corrected the mi&s;take, in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis.</P>
<P>Guido, Bi&s;hop of Amiens from the year 1058 to 1076, wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror, in which, according to Ordericus Vitalis, he imitated both Virgil and Statius. William of Apulia compo&s;ed, at the reque&s;t of Pope Urban the IId, a poem, in five books, on the actions of the Normans in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria, to the death of Robert Gui&s;card their prince; addre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="157" REF="156">
his work to the &s;on of that hero. It was written between the years 1080 and 1099; fir&s;t printed in 1582, 4to; and again in Muratori's Script. Ital. Du Cange, in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Prince&s;s Anna Comnena, has illu&s;trated that hi&s;tory by frequent and long quota|tions from William of Apulia; but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius, his poetry appears to me but a few de|grees &s;uperior to that of the Monk Abbo, whom I have ju&s;t mentioned. The Reader may judge from the following pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;elect not only as a &s;pecimen of the Author's &s;tyle, but as it &s;hews that the wives of the&s;e martial Princes &s;hared with them in all the perils of war.</P>
<Q><L>Uxor in hoc bello Roberti forte &s;agitta</L>
<L>Quadam lae&s;a fuit, quae vulnere territa, nullam</L>
<L>Dum &s;perabat opem, &s;e pene &s;ubegerat ho&s;ti,</L>

<L>Hanc deus eripuit, fieri ludibria nolens</L>

<P>The Prince&s;s Comnena has al&s;o celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine, who&s;e name was Gaita, di&s;played in the battle; and it is re|markable, that the royal female Hi&s;torian de&s;cribes the noble Amazon. more poetically than the Latin Poet.</P>
<P>Gualfredo, an Italian, who &s;ucceeded to the bi&s;hoprick of Siena in the year 1080, and died in 1127, wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne, which is &s;aid to be &s;till pre&s;erved in MS. at Siena. I believe Gualfredo is the fir&s;t Poet, in point of time, who treated of the happy &s;ubject of the Cru&s;ades; which was afterwards em|belli&s;hed by two very elegant writers of Latin ver&s;e, I&s;canus and Gun|ther, of whom I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak, and at length received its highe&s;t honour from the genius of Ta&s;&s;o. There is al&s;o an early Latin poem on this &s;ubject, the joint production of two writers, named Fulco and Aegi|dius, whom the accurate Fabricius places in the beginning of the 13th. century; the title of the work is Hi&s;toria. Ge&s;torum Viae: no&s;tri Tem|poris Hiero&s;olymitanae. It is printed in the fourth volume of Duche&s;ne's Script. Franc. and with con&s;iderable additions in the third volume of

Anecdota Edmundi Martene. I tran&s;cribe part of the opening of this poem, as the curious reader may have a plea&s;ure in comparing it with that of Ta&s;&s;o.

I will only add the portrait of Godfrey:

The poem clo&s;es with the capture of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Laurentius of Verona, who flouri&s;hed about the year 1120, wrote an Heroic poem, in &s;even books, entitled, Rerum in Majorica Pi&s;anorum. Edidit Ughellus, tom. 3. Italiae &s;acrae.</P>
<P>But in merit and reputation, the&s;e early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Philip Gualtier de Chatillon, who &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t that caught any portion of true poetic &s;pirit in Latin ver&s;e. He was Provo&s;t of the Canons of Tournay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fabricius calls him Epi&s;copus Magalonen&s;is. Bib. Lat. tom. ii. p. 255.</NOTE> about the year 1200, according to Mr. Warton, who has given &s;ome &s;pecimens of his &s;tyle in the &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to his admirable Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry. I &s;hall therefore only add, that the be&s;t edition of his Alexandreid, an Heroic
<PB N="159" REF="158">
poem in ten books on Alexander the Great, was printed at Leyden, 4to, 1558.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior merit of Jo&s;ephus I&s;canus, or Jo&s;eph of Exeter, has been al&s;o di&s;played by the &s;ame judicious Encomia&s;t, in the Di&s;&s;ertation I have mentioned; nor has he failed to commemorate two Latin Epic Poets of the &s;ame period, and of con&s;iderable merit for the time in which they lived&mdash;Gunther, and William of Bretagny; the fir&s;t was a German monk, who wrote after the year 1108, and has left various hi&s;torical and poetical works; particularly two of the Epic kind&mdash;Solymarium, a poem on the taking of Jeru&s;alem by Godfrey of Bulloign; and another, entitled Ligurinus, on the exploits of the Emperor Frederick Barba|ro&s;&s;a, which he completed during the life of that Prince. The fir&s;t was never printed; of the latter there have been &s;everal editions, and one by the celebrated Melancthon, in 1569. That his poetical merit was con&s;iderable in many re&s;pects, will appear from the following ver&s;es, in which he &s;peaks of him&s;elf.</P>
<Q><L>Hoc quoque me famae, &s;i de&s;int caetera, &s;olum</L>
<L>Conciliare pote&s;t, quod jam per multa latentes</L>
<L>Saecula, nec clau&s;is prodire penatibus au&s;as</L>
<L>Pierides vulgare paro, pri&s;cumque nitorem</L>
<L>Reddere carminibus, tardo&s;que citare poetas.</L></Q>
<P>William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot, natural &s;on of Philip Augu&s;tus, King of France, and addre&s;&s;ed a poem to his pupil, entitled Karlotis, which is yet unpubli&s;hed; but his greater work, called Philippis, an Heroic poem in twelve books, is printed in the collections of Duche&s;ne and Pithaeus; and in a &s;eparate 4to volume, with a copious commentary by Barthius. Notwith&s;tanding the prai&s;es be&s;towed on this Author by his learned Commentator, who prefers him to all his contemporaries, he appears to me inferior in poetic &s;pirit to his three rivals, Gualtier de Chatillon, I&s;canus, and Gunther. Yet his work is by no means de&s;picable in its &s;tyle, and may be con&s;idered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived; for he was him&s;elf engaged in many of the &s;cenes which he de&s;cribes. His profe&s;t de&s;ign is to cele|brate the exploits, of Philip Augu&s;tus; and he clo&s;es his poem with the
<PB N="160" REF="159">
death of that Monarch, which happened in 1223. He addre&s;&s;es his work, in two &s;eparate poetical dedications, to Lewis, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Philip, and to Pierre Charlot his natural &s;on, who was Bi&s;hop of Noyon in 1240, and died 1249, He &s;eems to have been excited to this compo|&s;ition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid; to which he thus alludes, in the ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to Lewis:
<Q><LG>
<L>Ge&s;ta ducis Macedum celebri de&s;cribere ver&s;u</L>
<L>Si licuit Gualtere tibi, quae &s;ola relatu</L>
<L>Multivago docuit te vociferatio famae.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cur ego quae novi, proprio quae lumine vidi,</L>
<L>Non au&s;im magni magnalia &s;cribere regis,</L>
<L>Qui nec Alexandro minor e&s;t virtute, nec illo</L>
<L>Urbi Rumuleae totum qui &s;ubdidit orbem?</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>He takes occa&s;ion al&s;o, in two other parts of his poem, to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier, to whom, in poetical ability, he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf inferior; but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow. Of their re&s;pective talents the reader may judge, who will compare the pa&s;&s;age which Mr. Warton has cited from the Alexandreid, with the following lines, in which William of Bretagny u&s;es the very &s;imile of his predece&s;&s;or, comparing his hero Philip to a young lion.</P>

Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno, and Pits calls him Poetarum &s;ui temporis apud no&s;trates facile Princeps; but I do not find that his Work was ever printed; nor do the &s;everal biographical writers who &s;peak of him, inform us where it ex|i&s;ts in MS.</P>

<P>With Petrarch I may clo&s;e this cur&s;ory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems in Latin, during the cour&s;e of the dark ages.&mdash;A peculiar circum&s;tance induces me to add another name to the preceding li&s;t. John, Abbot of Peterborough, in the reign of Edward the Third, wrote an Heroic poem, entitled Bellum Navarren&s;e, 1366, de Petro rege Aragoniae, &amp; Edwardo Principe. This per|formance, containing five hundred and &s;ixty ver&s;es, is &s;aid to be pre|&s;erved in MS. in the Bodleian Library; and I have thought it worthy of notice, becau&s;e it treats of the very &s;ubject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem.</P>
<P>Of the many Latin compo&s;itions of the Epic kind, which later times have produced, the Chri&s;tiad of Vida, the Sarcotis of Ma&s;&s;enius, and the Con&s;tantine of Mambrun, appear to me the mo&s;t worthy of regard; but even the&s;e are &s;eldom peru&s;ed: and indeed the Poet, who in a poli&s;hed age prefers the u&s;e of a dead language to that of a living one, can only expect, and perhaps only de&s;erves, the attention of a few curious &s;e|que&s;tered &s;tudents.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE IV. VERSE 81.</HEAD>
<Q>Thy daring Dante his wild Vi&s;ion &s;ung.]</Q>
<P>Dante Allighieri was born at Florence, in May 1265, of an ancient and honourable family. Boccacio, who lived in the &s;ame period, has left a very curious and entertaining Treati&s;e, on the Life, the Studies, and Manners of this extraordinary Poet; whom he regarded as his ma&s;ter, and for who&s;e memory he pro|fe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t veneration. This intere&s;ting biographer relates, that Dante, before he was nine years old, conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his &s;ingular Poem. Her age was near his own; and her name was Beatrice, the daughter of Folco Portinari, a noble citizen of Florence. Of this fair one the be&s;t accounts are ob|&s;cure. Some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal exi&s;t|ence; affirming her to be nothing more or le&s;s than Theology. But we may que&s;tion if Theology was ever the mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o young a lover. The pa&s;&s;ion of Dante, however, like that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Petrarch, &s;eems to have been of the cha&s;te and Platonic kind, according to the account he has him&s;elf given of it, in one of his early productions, entitled Vita Nuova; a mixture of my&s;terious poetry and pro&s;e, in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who, according to Boccacio, died at the age of twenty-four. The &s;ame author a&s;&s;erts, that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in con&s;equence of this event, from which his friends endeavoured to rai&s;e him; by per|&s;uading him to marriage. After &s;ome time he followed their advice, and repented it; for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to the celebrated Xantippe. The Poet, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the patience of Socrates, &s;eparated him&s;elf from her with &s;uch vehement expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;like, that he never afterwards admitted her to his pre|&s;ence, though &s;he had borne him &s;everal children.&mdash;In the early part of his life he gained &s;ome credit in a military character; di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a &s;ignal victory over the citizens of Arezzo. He became &s;till more emi|nent by the acqui&s;ition of civil honours; and at the age of thirty-five he ro&s;e to be one of the chief magi&s;trates of Florence, when that dignity was conferred by the &s;uffrages of the people. From this ex|altation
<PB N="167" REF="166">
the Poet him&s;elf dated his principal misfortunes, as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni; one of his early biographers, where Dante &s;peaks of his political failure with that liberal frankne&s;s which integrity in&s;pires.&mdash;Italy was at that time di&s;|tracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs: the latter, among whom Dante took an active part, were again divided into the Blacks and the Whites. Dante, &s;ays Gravina, exerted all his influence to unite the&s;e inferior parties; but his efforts were ineffectual, and he had the misfortune to be unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e of his own faction. A powerful citizen of Florence, named Cor&s;o Donati, had taken mea&s;ures to terminate the&s;e inte&s;tine broils, by introducing Charles of Valois, brother to Philip the Fair, King of France. Dante, with great vehemence, oppo&s;ed this di&s;graceful project, and obtained the bani&s;hment of Donati and his partizans. The exiles applied to the Pope (Boniface the VIIIth) and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign. Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph, and tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed his admi&s;&s;ion were bani&s;hed in their turn. Dante had been di&s;patched to Rome as the amba&s;&s;ador of his party, and was re|turning, when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city. His enemies, availing them&s;elves of his ab&s;ence, had procured an iniquitous &s;entence again&s;t him, by which he was condemned to bani&s;h|ment, and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated. His two enthu&s;ia&s;tic bio|graphers, Boccacio acid Manetti, expre&s;s the warme&s;t indignation again&s;t this inju&s;tice of his country. Dante, on receiving the intelligence, took refuge in Siena, and afterwards in Arezzo, where many of his party were a&s;&s;embled. An attempt was made to &s;urprize the city of Florence, by a &s;mall army which Dante is &s;uppo&s;ed to have attended: the de&s;ign mi&s;carried, and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy, till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala, Prince of Verona, whom he has celebrated in his Poem. The high &s;pirit of Dante was ill &s;uited to courtly dependence; and he is &s;aid to have lo&s;t the favour of his Veroneze patron by the rough frankne&s;s of his beha|viour. From Verona he retired to France, according to Manetti; and Boccacio affirms that he di&s;puted in the Theological Schools of Paris with great reputation. Bayle que&s;tions his vi&s;iting Paris at this period of his life, and thinks it improbable, that a man, who had been one of
<PB N="168" REF="167">
the chief magi&s;trates of Florence, &s;hould conde&s;cend to engage in the public &s;quabbles of the Pari&s;ian Theologi&s;ts; but the &s;pirit both of Dante, and the times in which he lived, &s;ufficiently account for this ex|erci&s;e of his talents; and his re&s;idence in France at this &s;ea&s;on is con|firmed by Boccacio, in his life of our Poet, which Bayle &s;eems to have had no opportunity of con&s;ulting.</P>
<P>The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire, in November 1308, afforded Dante a pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to his na|tive city, as he attached him&s;elf to the intere&s;t of the new Emperor, in who&s;e &s;ervice he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written his Latin treati&s;e De Monarchia, in which he a&s;&s;erted the rights of the Empire again&s;t the encroachments of the Papacy. In the year 1311, he in&s;tigated Henry to lay &s;iege to Florence; in which enterprize, &s;ays one of his Biographers, he did not appear in per&s;on, from motives of re&s;pect towards his native city. The Emperor was repul&s;ed by the Florentines; and his death, which happened in the &s;ucceeding year, deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in Florence.</P>
<P>After this di&s;appointment, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in roving about Italy in a &s;tate of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, till he found an honourable e&s;tabli&s;hment at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta, the lord of that city, who received this illu&s;trious exile with the mo&s;t endearing liberality, continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life, and extended his munifi|cence to the a&s;hes of the Poet.</P>
<P>Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree. On this account he is &s;aid to have been employed on fourteen different emba&s;&s;ies in the cour&s;e of his life, and to have &s;uc|ceeded in mo&s;t of them. His patron Guido had occa&s;ion to try his abilities in a &s;ervice of this nature, and di&s;patched him as his amba&s;&s;ador to negociate a peace with the Venetians, who were preparing for ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t Ravenna. Manetti a&s;&s;erts that he was unable to procure a public audience at Venice, and returned to Ravenna by land, from his apprehen&s;ions of the Venetian fleet; when the fatigue of his journey, and the mortification of failing in his attempt to pre&s;erve his generous patron from the impending danger, threw him into a fever, which ter|minated in death on the 14th of September 1321. He died, however,
<PB N="169" REF="168">
in the palace of his friend, and the affectionate Guido paid the mo&s;t ten|der regard to his memory. This magnificent patron, &s;ays Boccacio, commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the &s;treets of Ravenna by the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious citizens, to be depo&s;ited in a marble coffin. He pronounced him|&s;elf the funeral oration, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign of erecting a &s;plendid monument in honour of the decea&s;ed: a de&s;ign which his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes rendered him unable to accompli&s;h. At his reque&s;t, many epitaphs Were written on the Poet: the be&s;t of them, &s;ays Boccacio, by Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, a famous author of that time, and the intimate friend of Dante. Boccacio then cites a few Latin ver&s;es, not worth tran&s;cribing, &s;ix of which are quoted by Bayle as the com|po&s;ition of Dante him&s;elf, on the authority of Paul Jovius. In 1483 Bernardo Bembo, the father of the celebrated Cardinal, rai&s;ed a hand|&s;ome monument over the neglected a&s;hes of the Poet, with the following in&s;cription:</P>
<Q><L>Exigua tumuli Danthes hic &s;orte jacebas</L>
<L>Squallenti nulli cognita paene &s;itu;</L>
<L>At nunc marmoreo &s;ubnixus conderis arcu,</L>
<L>Omnibus et cultu &s;plendidiore nites:</L>
<L>Nimirum Bembus, Mu&s;is incen&s;us Etru&s;cis,</L>
<L>Hoc tibi, quem in primis hae coluere, dedit.</L></Q>
<P>Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna. In the age of Leo the Xth they made a &s;econd attempt, by a &s;olemn application to the Pope, for that purpo&s;e; and the great Michael Angelo, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of Dante, very liberally offered to execute a magnificent mo|nument to the Poet. The hopes of the Florentines were again un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. The particulars of their &s;ingular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>The per&s;on and manners of Dante are thus repre&s;ented by the de&s;crip|tive pen of Boccacia:&mdash;"Fu adunque que&s;to no&s;tro Pceta di Mezzana &s;tatura; e poich&egrave; alla matura et&agrave; fu pervenuto, and&ograve; alquanto gravetto, ed era il &s;uo andar grave, e man&s;ueto, di one&s;ti&s;&s;imi panni &s;empre ve&s;tito,

<PB N="171" REF="170">
e nel poto fu mode&s;ti&s;&s;imo.&mdash;Though Dante is de&s;cribed as much inclined to melancholy, and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and &s;ublime, yet in his early period of life he &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the lighter graces of &s;prightly compo&s;ition, as appears from the following airy and &s;portive &s;onnet:</P>

<P>The&s;e lively ver&s;es were evidently written before the Poet lo&s;t the object of his earlie&s;t attachment, as &s;he is mentioned by the name of Bice. At what time, and in what place, he executed the great and &s;in|gular work which has rendered him immortal, his numerous Commen|tators &s;eem unable to determine. Boccacio a&s;&s;erts, that he began it in his thirty-fifth year, and had fini&s;hed &s;even Cantos of his Inferno before his exile; that in the plunder of his hou&s;e, on that event, the begin|ning
<PB N="171" REF="170">
of his poem was fortunately pre&s;erved, but remained for &s;ome time neglected, till its merit being accidentally di&s;covered by an intelligent Poet named Dino, it was &s;ent to the Marquis Maroello Male&s;pina, an Italian nobleman, by whom Dante was then protected. The Marquis re&s;tored the&s;e lo&s;t papers to the Poet, and intreated him to proceed in a work which opened in &s;o promi&s;ing a manner. To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante, which he mu&s;t have continued
<PB N="172" REF="171">
under all the di&s;advantages of an unfortunate and agitated life. It does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted Ve|rona, as he dedicated the Paradi&s;e to his Verone&s;e patron.&mdash;The Critics have variou&s;ly accounted for his having called his poem Comedia. He gave it that title, &s;aid one of his &s;ons, becau&s;e it opens with di&s;tre&s;s, and clo&s;es with felicity. The very high e&s;timation in which this production was held by his country, appears from a &s;ingular in&s;titution. The re|public of Florence, in the year 1373, a&s;&s;igned a public &s;tipend to a per|&s;on appointed to read lectures on the poem of Dante: Boccacio was the fir&s;t per&s;on engaged in this office; but his death happening in two years after his appointment, his Comment extended only to the &s;eventeen fir&s;t Cantos of the inferno. The critical di&s;&s;ertations that have been written on Dante are almo&s;t as numerous as tho&s;e to which Homer has given birth: the Italian, like the Grecian Bard, has been the &s;ubject of the highe&s;t panegyric, and of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t invective. Voltaire has &s;poken of him with that precipitate vivacity, which &s;o frequently led that lively Frenchman to in&s;ult the reputation of the noble&s;t writers. In one of his entertaining letters, he &s;ays to an Italian Abb&eacute;, "Je fais grand cas du courage, avec lequel vous avez o&s;&eacute; dire que Dante etoit un fou, et &s;on ouvrage un mon&s;tre&mdash;Le Dante pourra entrer dans les biblio|theques des curieux, mais il ne &s;era jamais lu." But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting to di&s;play the merits of this origi|nal Poet. Mr. Warton has introduced into his la&s;t volume on Engli&s;h Poetry, a judicious and &s;pirited &s;ummary of Dante's performance. We have &s;everal ver&s;ions of the celebrated &s;tory of Ugolino; but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language, though his whole work has been tran&s;lated into French, Spani&s;h, and Latin ver&s;e. The three Cantos which follow, were tran&s;lated a few years ago, to oblige a particular friend. The Author has &s;ince been &s;olicited to execute an entire tran&s;lation of Dante; but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render &s;uch a work a very laborious undertaking, and it appears very doubtful how far &s;uch a ver&s;ion would intere&s;t our country. Perhaps the reception of the&s;e Cantos may di&s;cover to the Tran&s;lator the &s;entiments of the public. At all events, he flatters him&s;elf that the en&s;uing portion of a celebrated poem may afford &s;ome plea&s;ure from its novelty, as he has endeavoured to give the Engli&s;h reader an idea of
<PB N="173" REF="172">
Dante's peculiar manner, by adopting his triple rhyme; and he does not recollect that this mode of ver&s;ification has ever appeared before in our language; it has obliged him of cour&s;e to make the number of tran&s;|lated lines corre&s;pond exactly with tho&s;e of the original. The diffi|culties attending this metre will &s;ufficiently &s;hew them&s;elves, and obtain &s;ome degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader.</P>

<Q>The gay Boccacio, tempts th' Italian Mu&s;e.</Q>
<P>Boccacio was almo&s;t utterly unknown to our country as a Poet, when two of our mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Critics re&s;tored his poetical reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrwhitt, to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator, has given a &s;ketch of Boccacio's The&s;eida, in his introductory di&s;cour&s;e to the Canterbury Tales; and Mr. Warton has enriched the fir&s;t volume of his Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry with a con&s;iderable &s;pecimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem, of which our country is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s but a &s;ingle copy.&mdash;The father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant, a native of Certaldo, near Florence, who in his travels attached him&s;elf to a young woman of Paris; and our Poet is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection. He was born in 1313, and educated as a &s;tudent of the canon law; but a &s;ight of Virgil's tomb, according to Filippo Villani, his mo&s;t ancient Biographer, made him re&s;olve to re|linqui&s;h his more irk&s;ome pur&s;uits, and devote him&s;elf entirely to the Mu&s;es. His life &s;eems to have been divided between literature and love, as he was equally remarkable for an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, and a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to &s;tudy. His mo&s;t celebrated mi&s;tre&s;s was Mary of Arragon, the natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples, the gene|rous and enthu&s;ia&s;tic patron of Petrarch. To this lady, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of The Fiammetta, Boccacio addre&s;&s;ed his capital poem, the The&s;eida; telling her, in an introductory letter, that it contained many allu&s;ions to the particular circum&s;tances of their own &s;ecret attachment. In his latter days he retired to Certaldo, and died there in the year 1475, of a di&s;order &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from exce&s;&s;ive application. Few authors have rendered more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the republic of let|ters than Boccacio, as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language, but was particularly in&s;trumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning: a merit which he &s;hared with Petrarch. The tender and generous friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two engaging authors, reflects the highe&s;t honour on both; and their letters to each other may be ranked among the mo&s;t intere&s;ting productions of that period. Boccacio compo&s;ed, according
<PB N="199" REF="198">
to Quadrio, no le&s;s than thirty-four volumes. His Novels are univer|&s;ally known: his Poetical Works are as follow: 1. La The&s;eida in Ottava Rima. 2. L'Amoro&s;a Vi&s;ione in Terza Rima. 3. Il Filo&s;trato in Ottava Rima. 4. Il Ninfale Fie&s;olano in Ottava Rima.&mdash;He piqued him&s;elf on being the fir&s;t Poet who &s;ung of martial &s;ubjects in Italian ver&s;e; and he has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed the inventor of the Ottava Rima, the common Heroic mea&s;ure of the Italian Mu&s;e; but Quadrio has &s;hewn that it was u&s;ed by preceding writers; and Pa&s;quier, in his Recherches, has quoted two &s;tanzas of Thibaud king of Navarre, writ|ten in the &s;ame mea&s;ure, on Blanch queen of France, who died in 1252. The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen ap|pears the more &s;triking, as he peculiarly prided him&s;elf on his poetical character; informing the world, by an in&s;cription on his tomb, that Poetry was his favourite pur&s;uit&mdash;Studium fuit alma Poe&s;is, are the la&s;t words of the epitaph which he compo&s;ed for him&s;elf.</P>

<Q>She &s;poke exulting, and Tri&s;&s;ino &s;ung.</Q>
<P>Giovanni Giorgio Tri&s;&s;ino was born of a noble family in Vicenza, 1478: he was particularly di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a pa&s;&s;ion for Poetry and Architecture; and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace. This he is &s;aid to have done from a de&s;ign of his own, under the direction of the cele|brated Palladio. He had the merit of writing the fir&s;t regular tragedy in the Italian language, entitled Sophoni&s;ba; but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed, though &s;ome learned Critics (and Gravina among&s;t them) have endeavoured to &s;upport the credit of that performance. His &s;ubject was the expul&s;ion of the Goths from Italy by Beli&s;arius; and his poem con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;even books, in blank ver&s;e. He addre&s;&s;ed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth; and profe&s;&s;es in his Dedication to have taken Ari&s;totle for his preceptor, and Homer for his guide.</P>
<P>The reader will excu&s;e a trifling anachroni&s;m, in my naming Tri&s;&s;ino before Ario&s;to, for poetical rea&s;ons. The Italia Liberata of the former was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1548; the Orlando Furio&s;o, in 1515. Tri&s;&s;ino died at Rome, 1550; Ario&s;to at Ferrara, 1533.</P>

<Q>Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son.</Q>
<P>The reputation of Torquato Ta&s;&s;o has almo&s;t eclip&s;ed that of his father Bernardo, who was him&s;elf a con&s;iderable Poet, and left two productions of the Epic kind, L'Amadigi, and Il Floridante: the latter remained unfini&s;hed at his death, but was afterwards publi&s;hed in its imperfect &s;tate by his &s;on; who has &s;poken of his father's poetry with filial regard, in his different critical works. The Amadigi was written at the reque&s;t of &s;everal Spani&s;h Grandees, in the court of Charles the Vth, and fir&s;t printed in Venice by Giolito, 1560. The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in compo&s;ing this work, among his Letters, volume the fir&s;t, page 198. I cannot help remarking, that the letter referred to contains a &s;imile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jeru&s;alem Delivered.</P>
<P>The Italians have formed a very plea&s;ing and valuable work, by col|lecting the letters of their eminent Painters; which contain much in|formation on points relating to their art.

<Q>Shall gay Ta&s;&s;oni want his fe&s;tive crown.</Q>
<P>Ale&s;&s;andro Ta&s;&s;oni, the &s;uppo&s;ed inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was born at Modena, 1565. His family was noble; but his parents dying during his infancy, left him expo&s;ed to vexatious law-&s;uits, which ab&s;orbed a great part of his patrimony, and rendered him dependant. In 1599 he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal A&s;canio Colonna, whom he at|tended on an emba&s;&s;y into Spain. He was occa&s;ionally di&s;patched into Italy on the &s;ervice of that Prelate, and in the cour&s;e of one of the&s;e ex|peditions wrote his Ob&s;ervations on Petrarch. In 1605 he is &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="202" REF="201">
to have quitted the &s;ervice of the Cardinal, and to have lived in a &s;tate of freedom at Rome, where, in 1607, he became the chief of a literary &s;ociety, entitled Academia degli Umori&s;ti. He was afterwards em|ployed in the &s;ervice of Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy; which, after &s;uffering many vexations in it, he quitted with a de&s;ign of devoting him&s;elf to &s;tudy and retirement. But this de&s;ign he was induced to re|linqui&s;h, and to &s;erve the Cardinal Lodovi&s;io, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. from whom he received a con&s;iderable &s;tipend. On the death of this patron, in 1632, he was recalled to his native city by Francis the Fir&s;t, Duke of Modena, and obtained an honourable e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in the court of that Prince. Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune: his health declined in the year of his return, and he expired in April 1635. His genius was particularly di&s;|po&s;ed to lively &s;atire; and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increa&s;e that di&s;po&s;ition. After having pa&s;&s;ed many vexatious and un|profitable years in the &s;ervice of the Great, he had his portrait painted, with a fig in his hand; and Muratori &s;uppo&s;es him to have written the&s;e two lines on the occa&s;ion:</P>

<Q>And ra&s;hly judges that her Vega's lyre.]</Q>
<P>The famous Lope de Vega, frequently called the Shake&s;pear of Spain, is perhaps the mo&s;t fertile Poet in the annals of Parna&s;&s;us; and it would be difficult to name any author, ancient or modern, &s;o univer&s;ally idolized while living by all ranks of people, and &s;o magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great. He was the &s;on of Felix de Vega and Franci&s;ca Fernandez,
<PB N="203" REF="202">
who were both de&s;cended from honourable families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our Poet was born in that city, on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expre&s;&s;ion, a Poet from his cradle; and, beginning to make ver&s;es before he had learned to write, he u&s;ed to bribe his elder &s;choll-fellows with a part of his breakfa&s;t, to commit to paper the lines he had compo&s;ed. Having lo&s;t his father while he was &s;till a child, he engaged in a frolic, very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain, till, having &s;pent their money, and being conducted before a magi&s;trate at Segovia, for offering to &s;ell a few trinkets, they were &s;ent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adventure, our young Poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique, Bi&s;hop of Avila, and began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his dramatic compo&s;itions, which were received with great applau&s;e by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period, he became a member of the univer&s;ity of Alcala, where he devoted him&s;elf for four years to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy. He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron; who is frequently mentioned in his Occa&s;ional Poems. He quitted that em|ployment on his marriage with I&s;abel de Urbina, a lady (&s;ays his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and vir|tuous without affectation. His dome&s;tic happine&s;s was &s;oon interrupted by a painful incident:&mdash;Having written &s;ome lively ver&s;es in ridicule of a per&s;on who had taken &s;ome injurious freedom with his character, he re|ceived a challenge in con&s;equence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which en&s;ued, to give his adver&s;ary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and &s;helter him&s;elf in Valencia. He re|&s;ided there a con&s;iderable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction on this event led him to relinqui&s;h his favourite &s;tudies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the inva&s;ion of England. He had a brother who &s;erved in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being &s;hot in an engagement with &s;ome Dutch ve&s;&s;els, his virtues were cele|brated by our afflicted Poet, who&s;e heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Armada, the di&s;con&s;olate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became Secretary to the Marquis

of Malpica, to whom he has addre&s;&s;ed a grateful Sonnet. From the &s;ervice of this Patron he pa&s;&s;ed into the hou&s;ehold of the Count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an inimitable Poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great, for the more inviting com|forts of a married life. His &s;econd choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and &s;ingular beauty. By this lady he had two children; a &s;on, who died in his infancy, and a daughter, named Feliciana, who &s;urvived her father. The death of his little boy is &s;aid to have ha&s;|tened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lo&s;e in about &s;even years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precari|ou&s;ne&s;s of all human enjoyments, he devoted him&s;elf to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the mo&s;t exemplary piety; &s;till continuing to produce an a&s;toni&s;hing variety of poetical compo&s;itions. His talents and his virtues procured him many un&s;olicited honours. Pope Urban the VIIIth &s;ent him the Cro&s;s of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apo&s;tolic Chamber; favours for which he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots) to that liberal Pontiff. In his &s;eventy-third year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared him&s;elf for it with the ut|mo&s;t compo&s;ure and devotion. His la&s;t hours were attended by many of his intimate friends, and particularly his chief patron the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, whom he made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manu&s;cripts. The manner in which he took leave of tho&s;e he loved was mo&s;t tender and affecting. He &s;aid to his Di&s;ciple and Biographer, Montalvan, That true fame con&s;i&s;ted in being good; and that he would willingly exchange all the applau&s;es he had received, to add a &s;ingle deed of virtue to the actions of his life. Having given his dying benediction to his daughter, and performed the la&s;t ceremonies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of Augu&s;t 1635.</P>
<P>The &s;plendor of his funeral was equal to the re&s;pect paid to him while living.&mdash;His magnificent patron, the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, invited the chief no|bility of the kingdom to attend it.

are printed with the works of the Poet, and may be con&s;idered as curious &s;pecimens of the fal&s;e eloquence which prevailed at that time. A vo|lume of encomia&s;tic ver&s;es, chiefly Spani&s;h, and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in Spain, was pub|li&s;hed &s;oon after the death of this lamented Bard. To this collection his friend and di&s;ciple Perez de Montalvan prefixed a circum&s;tantial ac|count of his life and death, which I have chiefly followed in the pre|ceding narrative. An ingenious Traveller, who has lately publi&s;hed a plea&s;ing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain, has imputed the duel in which Lope de Vega was engaged to the gallantries of his fir&s;t wife; but Montalvan's relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady, who&s;e innocence is &s;till farther &s;upported by a poem written in her prai&s;e by Pedro de Medina Medinilla: it is printed in the works of our Poet, who is introduced in it, under the name of Belardo, celebrating the ex|cellencies and lamenting the lo&s;s of his departed I&s;abel.</P>
<P>Of the per&s;on and manners of Lope de Vega, his friend Montalvan has only given this general account:&mdash;that his frame of body was parti|cularly &s;trong, and pre&s;erved by temperance in continued health;&mdash;that in conver&s;ation he was mild and una&s;&s;uming; courteous to all, and to women peculiarly gallant;&mdash;very eager when engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his friends, and &s;omewhat carele&s;s in the management of his own. Of his wealth and charity I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in a &s;ub&s;equent note. The chief expences in which he indulged him&s;elf were books and pictures; of the latter, he di&s;tributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends: to the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, a fine portrait of him&s;elf; and to me, &s;ays Montalvan, another, painted when he was young, &s;urrounded by dogs, monkies, and other mon&s;ters, and writing in the mid&s;t of them, without attending to their noi&s;e.&mdash;Of the honours paid to this extraor|dinary Poet, his Biographer a&s;&s;erts that no per&s;on of eminence vi&s;ited Spain without &s;eeking his per&s;onal acquaintance; that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the &s;treets, and women &s;aluted him with benedictions when he pa&s;&s;ed under their windows. If &s;uch ho|mage can be de&s;erved by the mo&s;t unwearied application to poetry, Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it. He declared that he con|&s;tantly wrote five &s;heets a day; and his biographers, who have formed a calculation from this account, conclude the number of his ver&s;es to be
<PB N="206" REF="205">
no le&s;s than 21,316,000. His country has very lately publi&s;hed an ele|gant edition of his poems in 19 quarto volumes; his dramatic works are to be added to this collection, and will probably be &s;till more volumi|nous. I &s;hall &s;peak only of the former.&mdash;Among his poems there are &s;everal of the Epic kind; the three following appear to me the mo&s;t remarkable. 1. La Dragontea. 2. La Hermo&s;ura de Angelica. 3. La Jeru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada. The Dragontea con&s;i&s;ts of ten cantos, on the la&s;t expedition and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake, whom the Poet, from his exce&s;&s;ive partiality to his country, con&s;iders as an ava|ricious pirate, or rather, as he chu&s;es to call him, a marine Dragon: and it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that he has treated him accordingly. The poem on Angelica &s;eems to have been written in emulation of Ario&s;to, and it is founded on a hint in that Poet: it was compo&s;ed in the early part of our Author's life, and contains many compliments to his &s;ove|reign Philip the IId: it con&s;i&s;ts of 20 cantos, and clo&s;es with Angeli|ca's being re&s;tored to her beloved Medoro. In his Jeru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada he enters the li&s;ts with Ta&s;&s;o, whom he mentions in his preface as hav|ing &s;ung the fir&s;t part of the hi&s;tory which he had cho&s;en for his &s;ubject. From the great name of Lope de Vega, I had &s;ome thoughts of pre&s;ent|ing to the reader a &s;ketch of this his mo&s;t remarkable poem; but as an Epic Poet he appears to me &s;o much inferior to Ta&s;&s;o, and to his coun|tryman and cotemporary Ercilla, that I am unwilling to &s;well the&s;e exten&s;ive notes by an enlarged de&s;cription of &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful a work: the Author has prophe&s;ied in the clo&s;e of it, that, although neglected by his own age, it would be e&s;teemed by futurity:&mdash;a &s;ingular proof that even the mo&s;t favoured writers are frequently di&s;po&s;ed to declaim again&s;t the period in which they live. If Lope de Vega could think him&s;elf neglected, what Poet may ever expect to be &s;atisfied with popu|lar applau&s;e?&mdash;But to return to his Jeru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada. Richard the Second of England, and Alphon&s;o the Eighth of Ca&s;tile, are the chief heroes of the poem; which contains twenty cantos; and clo&s;es with the unfortunate return of the&s;e confederate Kings, and the death of Saladin. It was fir&s;t printed 1609, more than twenty years after the fir&s;t appear|ance of Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;One of the mo&s;t amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega, is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals. In his Laurel de Apollo, he cele|brates
<PB N="207" REF="206">
all the eminent Spani&s;h and Portugueze Poets; he &s;peaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warme&s;t applau&s;e. Among the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing pa&s;&s;ages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father, who was, like the father of Ta&s;&s;o, a Poet of con&s;iderable talents.</P>
<P>Among the &s;maller pieces of Lope de Vega, there are two particularly curious; a de&s;criptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva, and a &s;onnet in honour of the Invincible Armada: the latter may be con&s;idered as a complete model of Spani&s;h bomba&s;t: "Go forth and burn the world," &s;ays the Poet, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to that mighty fleet; "my &s;ighs will furni&s;h your fails with a never-failing wind; and my brea&s;t will &s;upply your cannon with inexhau&s;tible fire."&mdash;Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spani&s;h character of our Poet, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e my imperfect account of him. It is his friend and biogra|pher Montalvan, who, in the opening of his life, be&s;tows on him the following titles: El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, Portento del Orbe, Gloria de la Nacion, Lu&s;tre de la Patria, Oracula de la Len|gua, Centro de la Fama, A&s;&s;umpio de la Invidia, Cuydado de la Fortuna, Fenix de los Siglos, Principe de los Ver&s;os, Orfeo de las Ciencias, Apolo de las Mu&s;as, Horacio de los Poetas, Virgilio de los Epicos, Homero de los Heroycos, Pindaro de los Lyricos, Sofocles de los Tra|gicos, y Terencio de los Comicos, Unico entre los Mayores, Mayor entre los Grandes, y Grande a todas Luzes, y en todas Materias.</P>

<L>His Epic trumpet in the fields of death.]</L></Q>
<P>Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally di&s;tingui&s;hed as a Hero and a Poet; but this exalted character, notwith&s;tanding his double claim to our regard, is almo&s;t to|tally unknown in our country, and I &s;hall therefore endeavour to give the Engli&s;h reader the be&s;t idea that I can, both of his gallant life, and of his &s;ingular poem.&mdash;He was born in Madrid, on the 7th of Augu&s;t 1533, the third &s;on of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, who, though de&s;cended from a noble family, pur&s;ued the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, and was &s;o remarkable for his talents, that he acquired the appellation of "The &s;ubtle Spaniard." The mother of our Poet was al&s;o noble, and from her he inherited his
<PB N="208" REF="207">
&s;econd title, Zuniga: Ercilla was the name of an ancient ca&s;tle in Bi&s;cay, which had been long in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his paternal ance&s;tors. He lo&s;t his father while he was yet an infant, a circum&s;tance which had, great influence on his future life; for his mother was received, after the de|cea&s;e of her hu&s;band, into the hou&s;ehold of the Empre&s;s, I&s;abella, the wife of Charles the Vth, and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace. He &s;oon obtained an appointment there, in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip, to who&s;e &s;ervice he devoted him&s;elf with the mo&s;t heroic enthu&s;ia&s;m, though Philip was a ma&s;ter who little de&s;erved &s;o generous an attachment. At the age of fourteen, he attended that Prince in the &s;plendid progre&s;s which he made, at the de&s;ire of his Imperial father, through the principal cities of the Netherlands, and through parts of Italy and Germany. This &s;ingular expedition is very circum&s;tantially recorded in a folio volume, by a Spa|ni&s;h hi&s;torian named Juan Chri&s;toval Calvete de E&s;trella, who&s;e work affords a very curious and &s;triking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age. All the cities which were vi&s;ited by the Prince contended with each other in magnificent fe&s;tivity: the bril|liant &s;eries of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited, though they an&s;wered not their de&s;ign of conciliating the affection of the &s;ullen Philip, might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet, and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame. In 1551, he returned with the Prince into Spain, and continued there for three years; at the end of which he attended his royal ma&s;ter to England on his marriage with Queen Mary, which was celebrated at Winche&s;ter in the &s;ummer of 1554. At this period Ercilla fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the military character; for his &s;overeign received advice, during his re&s;idence at Lon|don, that the martial natives of Aranco, a di&s;trict on the coa&s;t of Chile, had revolted from the Spani&s;h government, and di&s;patched an experienced officer, named Alderete, who attended him in England, to &s;ubdue the in&s;urrection, inve&s;ting him with the command of the rebellious pro|vince. Ercilla embarked with Alderete; but that officer dying in his pa&s;&s;age, our Poet proceeded to Lima. Don Hurtado de Mendoza, who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru, appointed his &s;on Don Garcia to &s;upply the place of Alderete, and &s;ent him with a con&s;iderable force to oppo&s;e the Arancanians. Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize, and
<PB N="209" REF="208">
greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the ob&s;tinate conte&s;t which en&s;ued. The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal &s;truggle, and the many &s;plendid feats of valour which this &s;cene afforded, led our author to the &s;ingular de&s;ign of making the war, in which he was him&s;elf engaged, the &s;ubject of an Heroic poem; which he entitled "La Araucana," from the name of the country. As many of his own par|ticular adventures may be found in the following &s;ummary of his work, I &s;hall not here enlarge on his military exploits; but proceed to one of the mo&s;t mortifying events of his life; which he briefly mentions in the conclu&s;ion of his poem. After pa&s;&s;ing with great honour through many and various perils, he was on the point of &s;uffering a di&s;graceful death, from the ra&s;h orders of his young and incon&s;iderate Commander. On his return from an expedition of adventure and di&s;covery, to the Spani&s;h city of Imperial, he was pre&s;ent at a &s;cene of public fe&s;tivity di&s;played there, to celebrate the acce&s;&s;ion of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain; at a kind of tournament, there aro&s;e an idle di&s;pute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pineda, in the heat of which the two di&s;putants drew their &s;words; many of the &s;pectators joined in the broil; and, a report ari&s;ing that the quarrel was a mere pretence, to conceal &s;ome mu|tinous de&s;ign, the ha&s;ty Don Garcia, their General, committed the two antagoni&s;ts to pri&s;on, and &s;entenced them both to be publicly beheaded. Ercilla him&s;elf declares, he was conducted to the &s;caffold before his pre|cipitate judge di&s;covered the iniquity of the &s;entence; but his innocence appeared ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave him; and he &s;eems to have been fully rein&s;tated in the good opinion of Don Garcia, as, among the com|plimentary &s;onnets addre&s;&s;ed to Ercilla, there is one which bears the name of his General, in which he &s;tyles him the Divine Alonzo, and cele|brates both his military and poetical genius. But Ercilla &s;eems to have been deeply wounded by this affront; for, quitting Chile, he went to Callao, the port of Lima, and there embarked on an expedition again&s;t a Spani&s;h rebel, named Lope de Aguirre, who, having murdered his captain, and u&s;urped the chief power, was perpetrating the mo&s;t cruel enormities in the &s;ettlement of Venezuela. But Ercilla learned, on his arrival at Panama, that this barbarous u&s;urper was de&s;troyed; he therefore re&s;olved, as his health was much impaired by the hard|&s;hips he had pa&s;&s;ed, to return to Spain. He arrived there in the twenty-ninth
<PB N="210" REF="209">
ninth year of his age; but &s;oon left it, and travelled, as he him&s;elf in|forms us, through France, Italy, Germany, Sile&s;ia, Moravia, and Pan|nonia; but the particulars of this expedition are unknown. In the year 1570 he appeared again at Madrid, and was married to Maria Bazan, a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the cour&s;e of his military poem. He is &s;aid to have been afterwards gentleman of the bed-chamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId, a prince who had been educated at Madrid; but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very in|di&s;tinctly recorded; and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known. In the year 1580 he re&s;ided at Madrid, in a &s;tate of retirement and poverty. The time and circum&s;tances of his death are uncertain: it is proved that he was living in the year 1596, by the evidence of a Spani&s;h writer named Mo&s;quera, who, in a treati&s;e of military di&s;cipline, &s;peaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, in a poem which has ne|ver appeared, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left imperfect at his death. Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits ware not entirely unrewarded. It is &s;aid, that in &s;peak|ing to his &s;overeign Philip, he was &s;o overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him: "Don Alonzo! (replied the King) &s;peak to me in writing."&mdash;He did &s;o, and obtained his reque&s;t. The Spani&s;h Hi&s;|torian Ovalle, who has written an account of Chile, in which he fre|quently &s;upports his narration by the authority of Ercilla, affirms that our Poet pre&s;ented his work to Philip with his own hand, and received a recompence from the King. But in this circum&s;tance I fear the Hi&s;|torian was mi&s;taken, as he &s;uppo&s;es it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile; and our Poet, in a di&s;tinct portion of his work, which was not publi&s;hed till many years after that period, expre&s;sly de|clares, in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Philip, that all his attempts to &s;erve him had been utterly unrequited. Ercilla left no legitimate family; but had &s;ome natural children, the mo&s;t eminent of which was a daugh|ter, who was advantageou&s;ly married to a nobleman of Portugal.</P>
<P>In that elegant collection of Spani&s;h Poets, "<HI>Parna&s;o E&s;pan~ol,</HI>" there is a plea&s;ing little amorous poem, written by Ercilla in his youth, which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega; who has be&s;towed a very ge|nerous encomium on our Poet, in his "<HI>Laurel de Apolo.</HI>" But the great
<PB N="211" REF="210">
and &s;ingular work which has ju&s;tly rendered Ercilla immortal, is his Poem entitled Araucana, which was publi&s;hed in three &s;eparate parts: the fir&s;t appeared in 1577; he added the &s;econd in the &s;ucceeding year; and in 1590 he printed a complete edition of the whole. It was applauded by the mo&s;t eminent writers of Spain; and Cervantes, in &s;peaking of Don Quixote's Library, has ranked it among the choice&s;t trea&s;ures of the Ca&s;tilian Mu&s;e. Voltaire, who &s;peaks of Ercilla with his u&s;ual &s;pirit and inaccuracy, has the merit of having made our Poet more gene|rally known, though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely &s;light; for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin: a mi&s;take into which he never could have fallen, had he read the Araucana. Indeed the undi&s;tingui&s;hing cen&s;ure which he pa&s;&s;es on the poem in general, after commending one particular pa&s;&s;age, &s;uffi|ciently proves him a perfect &s;tranger to many &s;ub&s;equent parts of the work; yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is ju&s;t. Ercilla is certainly unequal; but, with all his defects, he appears to me one of the mo&s;t extraordinary and engaging characters in the poetical world. Per|haps I am a little partial to him, from the accidental circum&s;tance of having fir&s;t read his poem with a departed friend, who&s;e opinions are very dear to me, and who was particularly fond of this military Bard. However this may be, my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following exten&s;ive &s;ketch of his Work: &mdash; it has &s;welled to a much larger &s;ize than I at fir&s;t intended; for I was continually tempted to ex|tend it, by the de&s;ire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet. If I have not utterly failed in that de&s;ire, the Engli&s;h reader will be enabled to judge, and to enjoy an author, who, con&s;idering his &s;ubject and its execution, may be &s;aid to &s;tand &s;ingle and unparal|leled in the ho&s;t of Poets. His beauties and his defects are of &s;o ob|vious a nature, that I &s;hall not enlarge upon them; but let it be re|membered, that his poem was compo&s;ed amid&s;t the toils and perils of the mo&s;t fatiguing and hazardous &s;ervice, and that his ver&s;es were &s;ome|times written on &s;craps of leather, from the want of better materials. His &s;tyle is remarkably pure and per&s;picuous, and, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;traint of rhyme, it has frequently all the ea&s;e, the &s;pirit, and the volu|bility of Homer. I wi&s;h not, however, to conceal his defects; and I have therefore given a very fair account of the &s;trange epi&s;ode he intro|duces
<PB N="212" REF="211">
concerning the hi&s;tory of Dido, which has ju&s;tly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire. I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, as an apology for Ercilla, that many Bards of his country have con&s;idered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady, and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixoti&s;m for having &s;landered the cha&s;tity of &s;o &s;potle&s;s a heroine. If my memory does not deceive me, both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido. We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman
<PB N="213" REF="212">
again&s;t our Poet on this occa&s;ion; but let us recollect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric &s;pirit, and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties, than can be found in Voltaire.</P>
<P>Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country; and, as I believe the mo&s;t elegant compli|ment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spani&s;h lady, I &s;hall clo&s;e this account of him with a tran&s;lation of the Sonnet, in which &s;he celebrates both the Hero and the Poet.</P>

<L>The ha&s;ty wing of time e&s;capes their &s;ight,</L>
<L>And tho&s;e dark evils that attend his flight:</L>
<L>Vainly they dream, with gay pre&s;umption warm,</L>
<L>Fortune for them will take a &s;teadier form;</L>
<L>She, unconcern'd at what her victims feel,</L>
<L>Turns with her wonted ha&s;te her fatal wheel.</L></Q></P>
<P>After blaming his countrymen for abu&s;ing their good fortune, the Poet celebrates, in the following &s;pirited manner, the eagerne&s;s and in|dignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spani&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors:
<Q><L>The Indians fir&s;t, by novelty di&s;may'd,</L>
<L>As Gods rever'd us, and as Gods obey'd;</L>
<L>But when they found we were of woman born,</L>
<L>Their homage turn'd to enmity and &s;corn:</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="215">Their childi&s;h error, when our weakne&s;s &s;how'd,</L>
<L>They blu&s;h'd at what their ignorance be&s;tow'd;</L>
<L>Fiercely they burnt, with anger and with &s;hame,</L>
<L>To &s;ee their ma&s;ters but of mortal frame.</L>
<L>Di&s;daining cold and cowardly delay,</L>
<L>They &s;eek atonement, on no di&s;tant day:</L>
<L>Prompt and re&s;olv'd, in quick debate they join,</L>
<L>To form of deep revenge their dire de&s;ign.</L>
<L>Impatient that their bold decree &s;hould &s;pread,</L>
<L>And &s;hake the world around with &s;udden dread,</L>
<L>Th' a&s;&s;embling Chieftains led &s;o large a train,</L>
<L>Their ready ho&s;t o'er&s;pread th' exten&s;ive plain.</L>
<L>No &s;ummons now the &s;oldier's heart requires;</L>
<L>The thir&s;t of battle every brea&s;t in&s;pires;</L>
<L>No pay, no promi&s;e of reward, they a&s;k,</L>
<L>Keen to accompli&s;h their &s;pontaneous ta&s;k;</L>
<L>And, by the force of one avenging blow,</L>
<L>Cru&s;h and annihilate their foreign foe.</L>
<L>Of &s;ome brave Chiefs, who to this council came,</L>
<L>Well may'&s;t thou, Memory, pre&s;erve the name;</L>
<L>Tho' rude and &s;avage, yet of noble &s;oul,</L>
<L>Ju&s;tly they claim their place on Glory's roll,</L>
<L>Who robbing Spain of many a gallant &s;on,</L>
<L>In &s;o confin'd a &s;pace &s;uch victories won;</L>
<L>Who&s;e fame &s;ome living Spaniards yet may &s;pread,</L>
<L>Too well atte&s;ted by our warlike dead.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Poet proceeds to mention, in the manner of Homer, but in a much &s;horter catalogue, the principal chieftains, and the number of their re&s;pective va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>Uncouthly as their names mu&s;t &s;ound to an Engli&s;h ear, it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to run through the li&s;t, as the&s;e free and noble-minded &s;avages act &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part in the cour&s;e of the poem.&mdash;Tucapel &s;tands fir&s;t; renowned for the mo&s;t inveterate enmity to the Chri&s;tians, and leader of three thou&s;and va&s;&s;als: Angol, a valiant youth, attended by four thou&s;and: Cayocupil, with three; and Millarapue, an elder chief,
<PB N="217" REF="216">
with five thou&s;and: Paycabi, with three thou&s;and; and Lemolemo, with &s;ix: Maregnano, Gual&egrave;mo, and Lebopia, with three thou&s;and each: Elicura, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;trength of body and dete&s;tation of &s;ervitude, with &s;ix thou&s;and; and the ancient Colocolo with a &s;uperior number: Ongolmo, with four thou&s;and; and Puren, with &s;ix; the fierce and gigantic Lincoza with a &s;till larger train. Peteguelen, lord of the valley of Arauco, prevented from per&s;onal attendance by the Chri&s;tians, di&s;|patches &s;ix thou&s;and of his retainers to the a&s;&s;embly: the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed of his party are Thom&egrave; and Andalican. The Lord of the mari|time province of Pilmayquen, the bold Caupolican, is al&s;o unable to appear at the opening of the council. Many other Chieftains attended, who&s;e names the Poet &s;uppre&s;&s;es, le&s;t his prolixity &s;hould offend. As they begin their bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tyle of the ancient Germans, with a plentiful banquet, they &s;oon grow exa&s;perated with liquor, and a vio|lent quarrel en&s;ues concerning the command of the forces for the pro|jected war: an honour which almo&s;t every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for him&s;elf. In the mid&s;t of this turbulent debate, the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue, which Voltaire prefers (and I think with great ju&s;tice) to the &s;peech of Ne&s;tor, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, in the fir&s;t Iliad.</P>
<Q><L>A&s;&s;embled Chiefs! ye guardians of the land!</L>

<P>The Chieftains acquie&s;ce in this propo&s;al; which, as Voltaire ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, is very natural in a nation of &s;avages. The beam is produced, and of a &s;ize &s;o enormous, that the Poet declares him&s;elf afraid to &s;pecify its weight. The fir&s;t Chieftains who engage in the trial &s;upport it on their &s;houlders five and &s;ix hours each; Tucapel fourteen; and Lincoza more than double that number; when the a&s;&s;embly, con&s;idering his &s;trength as almo&s;t &s;upernatural, is eager to be&s;tow on him the title of General; but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour, Caupolican arrives without attendants. His per&s;on and character are thus de&s;cribed by the Poet:
<Q><L>Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew</L>
<L>(The viewle&s;s orb was of the granate's hue)</L>
<L>Nature, who partly robb'd him of his &s;ight,</L>

<L>His actions honour'd, and his words of weight:</L>

<P>This accompli&s;hed Chieftain is received with great joy by the a&s;&s;em|bly; and, having &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Lincoza by many degrees in the trial, is in|ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command. He di&s;patches a &s;mall party to at|tack a neighbouring Spani&s;h fort: they execute his orders, and make
<PB N="220" REF="219">
a vigorous a&s;&s;ault. After a &s;harp conflict they are repul&s;ed; but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their &s;up|port. The Spaniards in de&s;pair evacuate the fort, and make their e&s;cape in the night: the news is brought to Valdivia, the Spani&s;h Commander in the city of Conception;&mdash;and with his re&s;olution to puni&s;h the Bar|barians the canto concludes.</P>

<P>With this &s;pirited and generous invective again&s;t that prevailing vice of his countrymen, which &s;ullied the lu&s;tre of their mo&s;t brilliant ex|ploits, Ercilla opens his 3d canto. He does not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that the enmity of the Indians aro&s;e from the avaricious &s;everity of their Spani&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors; and he accu&s;es Valdivia on this head, though he gives him the prai&s;e of a brave and gallant officer.&mdash;This Spaniard, on the fir&s;t intelligence of the Indian in&s;urrection, di&s;patched his &s;couts from the city where he commanded. They do not return. Pre&s;&s;ed by the impa|tient gallantry of his troops, Valdivia marches out:&mdash;they &s;oon di&s;cover the mangled heads of his me&s;&s;engers fixed up as a &s;pectacle of terror on the road. Valdivia deliberates what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue. His army en|treat him to continue his march. He con&s;ents, being piqued by their in&s;inuations of his di&s;gracing the Spani&s;h arms. An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thou&s;and of the confederated Indians are waiting to de&s;troy him in the valley of Tucapel. He &s;till pre&s;&s;es forward; ar|rives

in &s;ight of the fort which the Indians had de&s;troyed, and engages them in a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate battle; in the de&s;cription of which, the Poet introduces an original and &s;triking &s;imile, in the following manner:

<L>As the keen Crocodile, who loves to lay</L>

<L>From whence no Chri&s;tian &s;oldier '&s;cap'd with life.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards. The Poet then de&s;cribes the conflict of the main army with great &s;pirit:&mdash;ten Spa|niards di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;ignal acts of courage, but are all cut in pieces. The battle proceeds thus:
<Q><L>The ho&s;tile &s;word, now deeply dy'd in blood,</L>

<L>Courage &s;till grows to form the fierce attack,</L>

<P>Caupolican, leading his army back to the charge, in con&s;equence of Lantaro's efforts in their favour, obtains a complete victory. The Spa|niards are all &s;lain in the field, except their Commander Valdivia, who flies, attended only by a prie&s;t; but he is &s;oon taken pri&s;oner, and con|ducted before the Indian Chief, who is inclined to &s;pare his life; when an elder &s;avage, called Leocato, in a &s;udden bur&s;t of indignation, kills him with his club.</P>
<P>All the people of Arauco a&s;&s;emble in a great plain to celebrate their victory: old and young, women and children, unite in the fe&s;tival; and the trees that &s;urround the &s;cene of their a&s;&s;embly are decorated with the heads and &s;poils of their &s;laughtered enemies.</P>
<P>They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country, and even a de&s;cent on Spain. The General makes a prudent &s;peech to re&s;train their impetuo&s;ity; and afterwards, be&s;towing ju&s;t ap|plau&s;e on the brave exploit of the young Lantaro, appoints him his lieu|tenant.

They are informed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Valdivia. They attempt to retreat; but are &s;urrounded by numbers of the Araucanians:&mdash;when the Poet intro|duces the following in&s;tance of Spani&s;h heroi&s;m, which I in&s;ert as a curious &s;troke of their military character:

The veteran Colocolo propo&s;es a plan for their military operations. An ancient Augur, named Puche|calco, denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen, in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon. He recites the omens of their de&s;truction. The fierce Tucapel, provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet, &s;trikes him dead in the mid&s;t of his harangue, by a &s;udden blow of his mace. Caupolican orders the murderous Chieftain to be led to in&s;tant death. He defends him&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t numbers who attempt to &s;eize him. Lantaro, plea&s;ed by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour, intreats the General to forgive what had pa&s;&s;ed; and, at his interce&s;&s;ion, Tucapel is received into favour.

He i&s;&s;ues new re&s;trictions; and then, &s;ummoning his &s;oldiers together, addre&s;&s;es them, in a &s;pirited, yet calm and affectionate harangue, on the nece&s;&s;ity of martial obedience. While he is yet &s;peaking, the Spaniards return to the attack, but are again repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. They retreat, and encamp at the foot of a mountain, unmole&s;ted by any pur&s;uers.</P>

<P>THE Spaniards remain in their camp, while two of their adventurous &s;oldiers engage to return once more to the fort, and examine the &s;tate of it. On their approach, one of them, called Marcos Vaez, is &s;a|luted by his name, and promi&s;ed &s;ecurity, by a voice from within the walls. Lantaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friend&s;hip, and now invites him into the fort. The Indian Chief harangues on the re&s;olution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spa|niards, unle&s;s they &s;ubmit. He propo&s;es, however, terms of accommo|dation to his old friend Marcos, and &s;pecifies the tribute he &s;hould ex|pect. The Spaniard an&s;wers with di&s;dain, that the only tribute the Indians would receive from his countrymen would be torture and death. Lantaro replies, with great temper, that arms, and the valour of the re|&s;pective nations, mu&s;t determine this point; and proceeds to entertain his gue&s;t with a di&s;play of &s;ix Indians, whom he had mounted and trained to exerci&s;e on Spani&s;h hor&s;es. The Spaniard challenges the whole party: Lantaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict, but di&s;mi&s;&s;es him in peace. He recalls him, before he had proceeded far from the fort, and, telling him that his &s;oldiers were much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the want of provi&s;ion, entreats him to &s;end a &s;upply, affirming it to be true

heroi&s;m to relieve an enemy from the nece&s;&s;ities of famine. The Spa|niard &s;ub&s;cribes to the &s;entiment, and engages, if po&s;&s;ible, to comply with the reque&s;t. Returning to his camp, he acquaints his Commander Villagran with all that had pa&s;&s;ed; who, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome dangerous de&s;ign from Lantaro, decamps ha&s;tily in the night to regain the city. The Indian Chief is &s;everely mortified by their departure, as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat, by letting large currents of water into the mar&s;hy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped. De&s;pairing of being able to &s;ucceed again&s;t their city, now prepared to re&s;i&s;t him, he returns towards Arauco, mo&s;t &s;orely galled by his di&s;ap|pointment, and thus venting his angui&s;h:

<P>Lantaro continues his march into an Indian di&s;trict, from which he collects a &s;mall increa&s;e of force; and, after addre&s;&s;ing his &s;oldiers con|cerning the expediency of &s;trict military di&s;cipline, and the cau&s;e of their late ill &s;ucce&s;s, he turns again towards the city of St. Jago; but, receiving intelligence on his road of its preparations for defence, he again &s;u&s;pends his de&s;ign, and fortifies a po&s;t, which he chu&s;es with the hope of collecting &s;till greater numbers to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his projected enterprize. The Spaniards at St. Jago are eager to &s;ally in que&s;t of Lantaro, but their Commander Villagran was ab&s;ent on an expedition to the city of Imperial. In returning from thence he pa&s;&s;es near the po&s;t. of Lantaro. An Indian ally acquaints him with its &s;ituation, and, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the Spani&s;h officer, agrees to conduct him, by a &s;hort though difficult road, over a mountain, to attack the fort by &s;ur|prize. The Poet &s;u&s;pends his narration of this intere&s;ting event, to re|late the arrival of new forces from Spain in America; and he now be|gins

<P>THE Poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on Love: he affirms that the greate&s;t Poets have derived their glory from their vivid de&s;criptions of this enchanting pa&s;&s;ion; and he laments that he is precluded by his &s;ubject from indulging his imagination in &s;uch &s;cenes as are more likely to captivate a reader.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to intend this as an apology (but I mu&s;t own it is an un|&s;atisfactory one) for de&s;erting the fair Guacolda, whom he mentions no more. He proceeds to de&s;cribe the &s;harp conte&s;t which the undaunted Indians &s;till maintained in their fort:&mdash;they refu&s;e quarter, which is of|fered them by the Spani&s;h Leader, and all re&s;olutely peri&s;h with the brave and beloved Lantaro. The Poet then re&s;umes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile; and concludes the canto with a &s;pirited de&s;cription of a &s;torm, which attacked the ve&s;&s;els as they arrived in &s;ight of the province to which they were &s;teering.</P>

<P>THE &s;torm abates. The Spaniards land, and fortify them&s;elves on an i&s;land near the country of the Araucanians. The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo. Caupolican, their General, propo&s;es to attack the Spaniards in their new po&s;t. The elder Chieftains di&s;&s;uade him from the de&s;ign. A quarrel en&s;ues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelen:&mdash;they are appea&s;ed by a &s;peech of the venerable Colocolo; by who&s;e advice a &s;pirited and adroit young Indian, named Millalanco, is di&s;patched, as a peaceful amba&s;&s;ador, to learn the &s;itua|tion and de&s;igns of the Spaniards. He embarks in a large galley with oars, and &s;oon arrives at the i&s;land. He &s;urveys the Spani&s;h implements of war with a&s;toni&s;hment, and is conducted to the tent of the General, Don Garcia.</P>

<P>THE Indian addre&s;&s;es the Spani&s;h officers with a propo&s;al of peace and amity. He is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with pre&s;ents. The Chieftains, on his return, pretend to relinqui&s;h ho&s;tilities; but prepare &s;ecretly for war. The Spaniards remain unmole&s;ted on the i&s;land during the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on. They &s;end a &s;elect party of a hundred and thirty, including our Poet, to rai&s;e a fort on the continent: the&s;e execute their commi&s;&s;ion with infinite di&s;patch, and all the Spani&s;h troops remove to this new po&s;t. The Araucanians are alarmed. An intrepid Youth, named Gra|colano, propo&s;es to the Indian General, Caupolican, to &s;torm the fort. The Indians advance near it, under &s;helter of the night. The Poet de|&s;cribes him&s;elf, at this juncture, as oppre&s;&s;ed by the exce&s;&s;ive labours of the day, and unable to pur&s;ue his poetical &s;tudies according to his nightly cu&s;tom: the pen falls from his hand: he is &s;eized with violent pains and tremblings: his &s;trength and &s;en&s;es for&s;ake him: but &s;oon reco|vering from this infirmity, he enjoys a refre&s;hing &s;leep. Bellona appears to him in a vi&s;ion, and encourages him both as a &s;oldier and a poet. She conducts him, through a delicious country, to the &s;ummit of a mo&s;t lofty mountain; when, pointing to a &s;pot below, &s;he informs him it is St. Quintin, and that his countrymen, under the command of their &s;overeign Philip, are ju&s;t marching to attack it: &s;he adds, that her pre|&s;ence is nece&s;&s;ary in the mid&s;t of that important &s;cene; and leaves the Poet on the eminence to &s;urvey and record the battle.</P>

Netherlands, the enterprizes of the Turks, and the exploits of Don John of Au&s;tria, at that time unknown to fame. The&s;e &s;he hints very imperfectly, telling the Poet, that if he wi&s;hes for farther information, he mu&s;t follow the &s;teps of a tame deer, which he will find in a parti|cular &s;pot; this animal will lead him to the cell of an ancient hermit, formerly a &s;oldier, who will conduct him to the &s;ecret cave of the un&s;o|cial Fiton, a mighty magician, who will di&s;play to him the mo&s;t mira|culous vi&s;ions. His female In&s;tructor then advi&s;es him to mix &s;ofter &s;ubjects with the horrors of war, and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flouri&s;hed in Spain. He beholds all the&s;e lovely fair ones a&s;&s;embled in a delicious paradi&s;e; and he is particularly attracted by a young lady, who&s;e name he di&s;covers to be Donna Maria Bazan (his future wife): in the moment that he be|gins to que&s;tion his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty, he is rou&s;ed from his vi&s;ion by the &s;ound of an alarm.

<HEAD>CANTO XIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indians advance in three &s;quadrons. The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench, &s;upported on a lofty pike, by which he al&s;o pa&s;&s;es the wall. He defends him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the Spaniards with great &s;pirit; but, finding him&s;elf un&s;upported, he wrenches a lance from a Spani&s;h &s;oldier, and tries to leap once more over the trench; but he is &s;truck by a &s;tone while vaulting through the air, and falls, covered, as the Poet expre&s;sly declares, with two-and-thirty wounds. Some of his friends are &s;hot near him; but the Indians get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spa|nish lance with which he had &s;prung over the wall, and brandi&s;h it in triumph. The Spaniard, named Elvira, who had lo&s;t his weapon, piqued by the adventure, &s;allies from the fort, and returns, amid the &s;houts of his countrymen, with an Indian &s;pear which he won in &s;ingle combat from a Barbarian, whom he had perceived detached from his

party. The Indians attempt to &s;torm the fort on every &s;ide: many are de&s;troyed by the Spani&s;h fire-arms. The head of the ancient Peteguelen is &s;hot off; but Tucapel pa&s;&s;es the wall, and ru&s;hes with great &s;laughter into the mid&s;t of the enemy. The Spaniards who were in the &s;hips that anchored near the coa&s;t ha&s;ten on &s;hore, and march to a&s;&s;i&s;t their coun|trymen in the fort, but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march.

The Spaniards &s;ally from the fort, but &s;oon return to it, from the apprehen&s;ion of an ambu&s;cade. They clear their trench, and &s;trengthen the weaker parts of their fortification. Night comes on. The Poet de&s;cribes him&s;elf &s;tationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort, which was &s;eated on high and rocky ground:&mdash;fatigued with the toils of the day, and oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of his armour, which he continues to wear, he is troubled with a lethargic heavine&s;s; which he counteracts by exerci&s;e, declaring that his di&s;po&s;ition to &s;lumber in his po&s;t aro&s;e not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine, as mouldy bi&s;cuit and rain-water had been for &s;ome time his chief &s;u&s;tenance; and that he was accu&s;tomed to make the moi&s;t earth his bed, and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labours.

<P>GALVARINO appears in the A&s;&s;embly of the Indian Chieftains, and excites them, in a very animated &s;peech, to revenge the barba|rity with which he has been treated. He faints from lo&s;s of blood, in the clo&s;e of his harangue, but is recovered by the care of his friends, and re&s;tored to health. The Indians, exa&s;perated by the &s;ight of his wounds, unanimou&s;ly determine to pro&s;ecute the war. The Spaniards, advancing in Arauco, &s;end forth &s;couts to di&s;cover the di&s;po&s;ition of the neighbouring tribes. Ercilla, engaging in this &s;ervice, perceives an old Indian in a &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, apparently &s;inking under the infirmities of age; but, on his approach, the ancient figure flies from him with a&s;to|ni&s;hing rapidity. He endeavours in vain, though on hor&s;eback, to overtake this aged fugitive, who &s;oon e&s;capes from his &s;ight. He now di&s;covers the tame Deer foretold in his vi&s;ion; and, pur&s;uing it, is con|ducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage, where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner. Ercilla enquires after the Magician Fiton: the old man undertakes to guide him to the &s;ecret man&s;ion of that wonderful Necromancer, to whom he declares him&s;elf related. He adds, that he him&s;elf was once a di&s;tingui&s;hed warrior; but, having the misfortune to &s;ully his pa&s;t glory, without lo&s;ing his life, in a conflict with another Chieftain, he had withdrawn him&s;elf from &s;ociety, and lived twenty years as a hermit. He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magician, who&s;e re&s;idence and magical apparatus are de&s;cribed with great force of imagination. Fiton appears from a &s;ecret portal, and proves to be the aged figure who had e&s;caped &s;o &s;wiftly from the &s;ight of Ercilla. At the reque&s;t of
<PB N="259" REF="258">
his relation, the old Warrior, he conde&s;cends to &s;hew Ercilla the won|ders of his art. He leads him to a large lucid globe, &s;elf-&s;u&s;pended in the middle of an immen&s;e apartment. He tells him it is the work of forty years &s;tudy, and contains an exact repre&s;entation of the world, with this &s;ingular power, that it exhibits, at his command, any &s;cene of futurity which he wi&s;hes to behold:&mdash;that, knowing the heroic compo|&s;ition of Ercilla, he will give him an opportunity to vary and embelli&s;h his poem by the de&s;cription of a mo&s;t important &s;ea-fight, which he will di&s;play to him mo&s;t di&s;tinctly on that &s;phere. He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world. Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe, and perceives the naval forces of Spain, with tho&s;e of the Pope and the Venetians, prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks.</P>

Ercilla, after being enter|tained with other marvellous &s;ights, which he omits from his dread of prolixity, takes leave of his two aged friends, and regains his quarters.

A party of Spani&s;h hor&s;e precipitately attack their left wing, before which Caupolican was advancing. They are repul&s;ed. A general and ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ues. The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian &s;quadron, and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs. Many Spaniards are named who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in the battle. Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo di&s;play the mo&s;t &s;plendid acts of valour; and, though per&s;onal enemies, they mutually defend each other. Caupolican al&s;o, at the head of the left &s;quadron, obliges the Spaniards to retreat; and the Araucanians are on the point of gain|ing a deci&s;ive victory, when the fortune of the day begins to turn.</P>

<P>THE re&s;erved guard of the Spaniards, in which Ercilla was &s;tationed, advancing to the charge, recover the field, and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly. Caupolican, though victorious in his quarter, &s;ounds a retreat when he perceives this event. The Indians fly in great di&s;order. Rengo for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tains an unequal conflict, and at la&s;t retreats &s;ullenly into a wood, where he collects &s;everal of the &s;cattered fugitives. As Ercilla happened to advance towards this &s;pot, a Spaniard, called Remon, exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this Indian party from the wood. His honour being thus piqued, he ru&s;hes forward with a few followers, and, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces, the Spaniards obtain the victory, and return to their camp with &s;everal pri&s;oners. After this great defeat of the Indian army, the Spaniards, to deter their enemies from all future re&s;i&s;tance, barbarou&s;ly re&s;olve to execute twelve Chieftains of di&s;tinction, whom they find among their captives, and to leave their bodies expo&s;ed on the trees that &s;urrounded the field of battle. The generous Ercilla, lamenting this inhuman &s;entence, intercedes particularly for the life of one, alledging
<PB N="261" REF="260">
that he had &s;een him united with the Spaniards. This per&s;on proves to be Galvarino; who, on hearing the interce&s;&s;ion for his life, produces his mangled arms, which he had concealed in his bo&s;om, and, giving vent to his dete&s;tation of the Spaniards, in&s;i&s;ts on dying with his country|men. Ercilla per&s;i&s;ts in vain in his endeavour to &s;ave him. As, no executioner could be found among the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, a new mode of de&s;truction, &s;ays our Poet, was invented; and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him. The&s;e brave men ha&s;tened to accompli&s;h their fate with as much alacrity, continues Ercilla, as the mo&s;t &s;pirited warrior marches to an attack. One alone of the twelve begins to he&s;itate, and pray for mercy; declaring him&s;elf the lineal de&s;cendant of the mo&s;t ancient race and &s;overeign of the country. He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galva|rino, and, repenting his timidity, atones for it by in&s;tant death.</P>
<P>The Spaniards advance &s;till farther in the country and rai&s;e a fort where Valdivia had peri&s;hed. Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more, who tells him that Heaven thought proper to puni&s;h the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat; but that the Spaniards would &s;oon pay dearly for their pre&s;ent triumph. The Wizard retires after this prophecy, and, with much intreaty, allows Ercilla to follow him. Coming to a gloomy rock, he &s;trikes it with his wand; a &s;ecret door opens, and they enter into a delicious garden, which the Poet commends for its &s;ymmetry, expre&s;sly declaring that every hedge <HI>has its brother.</HI> The Magician leads him into a vault of alaba&s;ter; and, perceiving his wi&s;h, though he does not expre&s;s it, of &s;eeing the miraculous globe again, the courteous Fiton conducts him to it.</P>

<P>THE fair fugitive, whom our Poet de&s;cribes as &s;ingularly beautiful, relates her &s;tory. She tells him her name is Glaura, the daughter of an opulent Chieftain, with whom &s;he lived mo&s;t happily, till a bro|ther of her father's, who frequently re&s;ided with him, per&s;ecuted her with an unwarrantable pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;that &s;he in vain repre&s;ented to him the impious nature of his love;&mdash;he per&s;i&s;ted in his frantic attachment, and, on the appearance of a ho&s;tile party of Spaniards, ru&s;hed forth to die in her defence, intreating her to receive his departing &s;pirit. He fell in the action; her father &s;hared the &s;ame fate: &s;he her&s;elf e&s;caped at a po&s;tern gate into the woods. Two negroes, laden with &s;poil, di&s;covered, and &s;eized her. Her cries brought a young Indian, named Cariolano, to her re&s;cue: he &s;hot an arrow into the heart of the fir&s;t ru&s;&s;ian, and &s;tabbed the &s;econd. Glaura expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her hu&s;band. Before they could regain a place of &s;afety, they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards. The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal her&s;elf in a tree, while he ventured to meet the enemy. In her terror &s;he &s;ubmitted to this expedient, which, on recovery from her panic, &s;he bitterly repented; for when &s;he i&s;&s;ued from her retreat, &s;he &s;ought in vain for Cariolano, and &s;uppo&s;ed, from the clamour &s;he had heard, that he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed. She continued to wander in this wretched &s;tate of mind, &s;till unable to hear any tidings of her protector. While the fair Indian thus clo&s;es her narrative, Er|cilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians. One of his faithful Indian attendants, whom he had lately attached to him,
<PB N="263" REF="262">
intreats him to e&s;cape with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te; adding, that he can &s;ave him from pur&s;uit by his knowledge of the country; and that he will ri&s;que his own life mo&s;t willingly, to pre&s;erve that of Ercilla. Glaura bur&s;ts into an agony of joy, in di&s;covering her lo&s;t Cariolano in this faithful attendant. Ercilla exclaims, <Q>Adieu, my friends; I give you both your liberty, which is all I have at pre&s;ent to be&s;tow,</Q> and rejoins his little troop. Before he enters on the account of what followed, he relates the circum&s;tance by which he attached Cariolano to his &s;ervice; whom he had found alone, as he him&s;elf was marching with a &s;mall party, and a few pri&s;oners that he had taken. The Youth at fir&s;t de|fended him&s;elf, and &s;hot two Spaniards with his arrows, and continued to re&s;i&s;t the numbers that pre&s;&s;ed upon him, with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility, and wounding &s;e|veral. Ercilla generou&s;ly ru&s;hed in to his re&s;cue, and declared he. de|&s;erved a reward for his uncommon bravery, in&s;tead of being de&s;troyed &s;o unfairly. The Youth, in con&s;equence of this treatment, flung down his dagger, and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla. Our Poet, after relating this incident, returns to the &s;cene where his party was &s;urprized in a hollow road, and &s;everely galled by the enemy, who attacked them with &s;howers of &s;tones from the higher ground. Ercilla forces his way up the precipice, and, after di&s;per&s;ing part of the Indian force, effects his e&s;cape with a few followers; but all are wounded, and obliged to leave their baggage in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their numerous enemies.</P>

Tunconabala meets them, as he had projected, with the appearance of extreme poverty; and, after many a&s;&s;urances of the &s;terility of that region, advi&s;es them to return, or to advance by a different path, which he repre&s;ents to them as dan|gerous, but the only practicable road. On finding them re&s;olved to pre&s;s forward, he &s;upplies them with a guide. They advance, with great toil and danger. Their guide e&s;capes from them.

It may amu&s;e a cu|rious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch, on this occa&s;ion, with Milton, who has al&s;o written a Sonnet on the &s;ame &s;ubject. The Commentator Faria has a very plea&s;ant remark on this &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition. He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet, by producing an alphabetical li&s;t of two hundred great Poets, who have thus compli|mented the object of their affection; and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir, for having celebrated Bri&s;eis. If the Sonnets of the Portugueze Poet are worthy of attention, his Elegies are perhaps &s;till more &s;o, as they illu&s;trate many particulars of his intere&s;t|ing life, which ended in 1579, under the mo&s;t cruel circum&s;tances of neglect and poverty.</P>

<Q>No great Examples ri&s;e, but many a Rule.</Q>
<P>Before the appearance of Bo&s;&s;u's celebrated treati&s;e on Epic poetry, the French had a &s;imilar work written in Latin. The learned Je&s;uit Mambrun publi&s;hed, in 1652, a quarto volume, entitled, Di&s;&s;ertatio Peripatetica de Epico Carmine. His Di&s;&s;ertation is founded on the principles of Ari&s;totle, whom he con&s;iders as infallible authority; and he introduces the Greek Philo&s;opher to de|cide the following very curious que&s;tion, which he argues with becom|ing gravity, Whether the action of a woman can be &s;ufficiently &s;plendid to prove a proper &s;ubject for an Epic poem.&mdash;Having rea&s;oned on this delicate point, with more learning than gallantry, he thus concludes the debate: Congruenter magis finem huic quae&s;tioni ponere non licet, quam verbis Ari&s;totelis capite 15 Poeticae, ubi de moribus di&s;putat, <GAP DESC="foreign">;&mdash;id e&s;t, &s;ecunda proprietas morum e&s;t, ut &s;int congruen|tes, ut e&s;&s;e fortem mos e&s;t aliquis; at non congruit mulieri fortem e&s;&s;e aut terribilem ut vertit Riccobonus, vel <HI>prudentem</HI> ut Pacius.

The famous Chapelain, in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle, has very warmly attacked the&s;e ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Ari&s;totle.

<P>The Alaric of Scudery, and the Clovis of De&s;mare&s;ts, can &s;carce be reckoned more fortunate; but in this band of un&s;ucce&s;sful Epic writers, there was one Poet, of whom even the &s;evere Boileau could not allow him&s;elf to &s;peak ill; this was Le Moine, the author of St. Louis. The Satiri&s;t being a&s;ked, why he had never mentioned the poetry of Le Moine? replied with the two following ver&s;es, parodied from Corneille,

<Q>Keen Boileau &s;hall not want his proper prai&s;e.</Q>
<P>Nicolas Boileau De&s;|preaux was born <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> Paris, for it is a conte&s;ted point, on the fir&s;t of November 1636, and died in March 1711 of a drop&s;y, the very di&s;|ea&s;e which terminated the life of his Engli&s;h rival. The Lutrin of Boileau, &s;till con&s;idered by &s;ome French Critics of the pre&s;ent time as the be&s;t poem to which France has given birth, was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1674. It is with great rea&s;on and ju&s;tice that Voltaire confe&s;&s;es the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock. Few Poets can be &s;o properly compared as Pope and Boileau; and, wherever their writings will admit of compari&s;on, we may, without any national partiality, adjudge the &s;uperiority to the Engli&s;h Bard. The&s;e two great authors re&s;embled each other as much in the integrity of their lives, as in the &s;ubjects and execution of their &s;everal compo&s;itions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which &s;ufficiently prove that the inexorable Satiri&s;t had a mo&s;t generous and friendly heart; when Patru, the celebrated Advocate, who was ruined by his pa&s;&s;ion for literature, found him&s;elf under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling his expen&s;ive library, and had almo&s;t agreed to part with it for a moderate &s;um, Boileau gave him a much &s;uperior price; and, after paying the money, added this condition to the pur|cha&s;e, that Patru &s;hould retain, during his life, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the books. The &s;ucceeding in&s;tance of the Poet's genero&s;ity is yet nobler:&mdash; when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pen&s;ion of Corneille, Boileau ha&s;tened to Madame de Monte&s;pan, and &s;aid, that his Sovereign, equitable as he was, could not, without inju&s;|tice, grant a pen&s;ion to an author like him&s;elf, ju&s;t a&s;cending Parna&s;&s;us, and take it from Corneille, who had &s;o long been &s;eated on the &s;ummit; that he entreated her, for the honour of the King, to prevail on his Ma|je&s;ty rather to &s;trike off <HI>his</HI> pen&s;ion, than to withdraw that reward from a man who&s;e title to it was incomparably greater; and that he &s;hould more ea&s;ily con&s;ole him&s;elf under the lo&s;s of that di&s;tinction, than un|der the affliction of &s;eeing it taken away from &s;uch a Poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application had the &s;ucce&s;s which it de&s;erved, and it
<PB N="282" REF="281">
appears the more noble, when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau.</P>
<P>The long and unre&s;erved intercour&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive eulogy on the private character of Boileau: Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous, &s;aid the tender Racine, in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend.</P>

<Q>To &s;well the glory of her great Voltaire.]</Q>
<P>Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted, and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to &s;upport its reputation, it &s;eems at length to be &s;inking under that neglect and oblivion, which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the Epic Mu&s;e. Several of our mo&s;t eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar &s;eve|rity, and &s;ome have condemned it on the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite principles, merely becau&s;e it does not coincide with their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems. Their &s;en|tence has been pa&s;&s;ed only in &s;hort and incidental remarks; but a French writer, inflamed by per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t Voltaire, has rai&s;ed three octavo volumes on the defects of this &s;ingle poem. Mr. Clement, in his <HI>"Entretiens &s;ur le Poeme Epique relativement &agrave; la Henriade,"</HI> has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the e&s;&s;ential points of Epic poetry;&mdash;in the &s;tructure of its general plan, in the conduct of its va|rious parts, in &s;entiment, in character, in &s;tyle. His work indeed di&s;|plays an acrimonious dete&s;tation of the Poet whom he examines; and perhaps there is hardly any human compo&s;ition which could &s;upport the &s;crutiny of &s;o rigid an inqui&s;itor: the Henriade is utterly unequal to it; for in many articles we are obliged to confe&s;s, that the ju&s;tice of the Cri|tic is not inferior to his &s;everity. He di&s;covers, in his di&s;&s;ection of the

If any thing can de&s;erve &s;uch rigorous treatment, it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire, who, in his E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to &s;ink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers, that he might rai&s;e him&s;elf to their level; an attempt in which no au|thor can ultimately &s;ucceed; for, as D'Alembert has admirably remarked on a different occa&s;ion, Le public lai&s;&s;era l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire &s;on plaidoyer, rira de leurs efforts, non de genie, mais de rai&s;onnement, pour hau&s;&s;er leur place, et finira par mettre chacun &agrave; la &s;ienne.</P>

<Q>And, &s;hrouded in a mi&s;t of moral &s;pleen.]</Q>
<P>It &s;eems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope, that his moral virtues have had a tendency to dimini&s;h his poetical reputation. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a benevolent &s;pirit, and wi&s;hing to make the art, to which he devoted his life, as &s;erviceable as he could to the great intere&s;ts of mankind, he &s;oon quitted the higher regions of poetry, for the more level, and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire. He declares, with a noble pride ari&s;ing from the probity of his intention,
<Q><L>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,</L>
<L>But &s;toop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his &s;ong.</L></Q>
The &s;everity of Critici&s;m has from hence inferred, that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind, and that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more &s;ublime and pathetic Bards. This inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in rea&s;on; it would &s;urely be more gene|rous, and I will venture to add, more ju&s;t, to a&s;&s;ign very different cau&s;es for his having latterly applied him&s;elf to moral and &s;atyric compo&s;ition. If his preceding poems di&s;played only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderne&s;s, we might indeed very fairly conjecture, that he quitted the kind of poetry, where the&s;e qualities are particularly required, becau&s;e Nature directed him to &s;hine only as the Poet of rea&s;on.&mdash;But his earlier productions will authorize an oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. At an age when few authors have produced any capital work, Pope gave the world two poems;
<PB N="285" REF="284">
one the offspring of imagination, and the other of &s;en&s;ibility, which will ever &s;tand at the head of the two poetical cla&s;&s;es to which they belong: his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloi&s;e, have nothing to fear from any ri|vals, either of pa&s;t or of future time. When a writer has di&s;played &s;uch early proofs of exqui&s;ite fancy, and of tender enthu&s;ia&s;m, tho&s;e great con&s;tituents of the real Poet, ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater &s;cope and freer exerci&s;e to the&s;e qualities, rather than to a&s;&s;ert that he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s them in a &s;uperlative degree? Why then, it may be a&s;ked, did he confine him&s;elf to compo&s;itions in which the&s;e have little &s;hare? The life and character of Pope will perfectly explain the rea&s;ons, why he did not always follow the higher &s;ugge&s;tions of his own natural genius. He had entertained an opinion, that by &s;tooping to truth, and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the pa&s;&s;ing time, he &s;hould be mo&s;t able to benefit mankind. The idea was perhaps ill-founded, but his conduct in con&s;equence of it was certainly noble. Its effects however were mo&s;t unhappy; for it took from him all his enjoy|ment of life, and may injure, in &s;ome degree, his immortal reputation: by &s;uffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools, he fell into the &s;plenetic delu&s;ion, that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly; and from hence he has been reproached for &s;uppo&s;ing that all human merit was confined to him&s;elf, and to a few of his mo&s;t inti|mate corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>There was an amiable peculiarity in the character of Pope, which had great influence both on his conduct and compo&s;ition&mdash;he embraced the &s;entiments of tho&s;e he loved with a kind of &s;uper&s;titious regard; his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affec|tionate heart: it was this which led him, at the reque&s;t of his idol Bo|lingbroke, to write a &s;ublime poem on metaphy&s;ical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend; it was this which urged him almo&s;t to quar|rel with Mr. Allen, in compliance with the caprices of a female friend; it was this which induced him, in the warmth of gratitude, to follow the ab&s;urd hints of Warburton with all the blindne&s;s of infatuated af|fection. Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a mi|nute and unprejudiced attention, will find that his excellencies, both as a Poet and a Man, were peculiarly his own; and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment, or the artifice, of his real and pre|tended
<PB N="286" REF="285">
friends. The lavi&s;h applau&s;e and the advice of his favourite Atterbury, was perhaps the cau&s;e of his pre&s;erving the famous character of Addi&s;on, which, finely written as it is, all the lovers of Pope mu&s;t wi&s;h him to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Few of his friends had integrity or frank|ne&s;s &s;ufficient to per&s;uade him, that his &s;atires would, de&s;troy the tran|quillity of his life, and cloud the lu&s;tre of his fame: yet, to the honour of Lyttelton, be it remembered, that he &s;ugge&s;ted &s;uch ideas to the Poet, in the ver&s;es which he wrote to him from Rome, with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friend&s;hip:
<Q><L>No more let meaner Satire dim the rays</L>
<L>That flow maje&s;tic from thy nobler bays!</L>
<L>In all the flowery paths of Pindus &s;tray,</L>
<L>But &s;hun that thorny, that unplea&s;ing way!</L>
<L>Nor, when each &s;oft, engaging Mu&s;e is thine,</L>
<L>Addre&s;s the lea&s;t attractive of the Nine!</L></Q></P>
<P>This generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect, for other coun&s;ellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet, and the malignity of his enemies had exa&s;perated his temper; yet he af|terwards turned his thoughts towards the compo&s;ition of a national Epic poem, and po&s;&s;ibly in con&s;equence of the hint which this Epi&s;tle of Lyt|telton contains. The intention was formed too late, for it aro&s;e in his decline of life. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed health and lei&s;ure to execute &s;uch a work, I am per&s;uaded it would have proved a glorious acqui&s;ition to the literature of our country: the &s;ubject indeed which he had cho&s;en mu&s;t be allowed to have an unpromi&s;ing appearance; but the opinion of Addi|&s;on concerning his Sylphs, which was &s;urely hone&s;t, and not invidious, may teach us hardly ever to decide again&s;t the intended works of a &s;u|perior genius. Yet in all the Arts, we are perpetually tempted to pro|nounce &s;uch deci&s;ions. I have frequently condemned &s;ubjects which my friend Romney had &s;elected for the pencil; but in the &s;equel, my opinion only proved that I was near-&s;ighted in tho&s;e regions of imagina|tion, where his keener eyes commanded all the pro&s;pect.</P>

<Q>Receive the Laurel from imperial Charles!]</Q>
<P>Ario&s;to is &s;aid to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua, by the Emperor Charles the Vth, towards the end of the year 1532. This fact has been di&s;puted by various writers, but it &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed by the re&s;earches of Mazzuchelli.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of crowning Poets with laurel is almo&s;t as ancient as poetry it&s;elf, &s;ays the Abb&eacute; du Re&s;nel, in his Recherches &s;ur les Poetes couron|nez, a work which contains but &s;canty information on this curious topic. Petrarch is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have revived this ancient &s;olemnity, which had been aboli&s;hed as a pagan in&s;titution in the reign of the Em|peror Theodo&s;ius. It appears however, from two pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of Boccacio, that Dante had entertained &s;erious thoughts of this honour|able di&s;tinction, which his exile precluded him from receiving, as he cho&s;e, &s;ays his Biographer, to be crown'd only in his native city.</P>
<P>An amu&s;ing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages, and in various parts of the world. It is remarkable, that the mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed nations have been the mo&s;t lavi&s;h in rewarding their Bards. There are two in&s;tances on record, in which poe|tical talents have rai&s;ed their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors even to &s;overeign dominion. The Scythians cho&s;e the Poet Thamyris for their king, though he was not a native of their country, <GAP DESC="foreign">. Hi&s;t. Poet. Script. Edit. Gale, p. 250. Saxo Grammaticus begins the &s;ixth book of his Hi&s;tory by relating, that the Danes be&s;towed their vacant diadem on the Poet Hiarnus, as a reward for his having compo&s;ed the be&s;t epitaph on their decea&s;ed &s;overeign Fro|tho. From the four Latin ver&s;es which the Hi&s;torian has given us, as a

<Q>For him her fountains gu&s;h with golden &s;treams.]</Q>
<P>Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet, his friend and biographer Montalvan has given a particular account. This author con|cludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a &s;um nearly equal to 20,000 pounds &s;terling; the revenue ari&s;ing from the po&s;ts he held, and from his pen&s;ion, was very con&s;iderable. His opu|lence was much encrea&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;plendid in&s;tances of private libe|rality. He received many co&s;tly pre&s;ents from various characters to whom he was per&s;onally unknown; and he was him&s;elf heard to &s;ay, in &s;peaking of his generous patron, that the Duke of Se&s;&s;a alone had given him, at different periods of his life, &s;ums almo&s;t amounting to &s;ix thou|&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the noble patrons of Engli&s;h poetry have not equalled this example of Spani&s;h munificence, even if we admit, the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the genero&s;ity of Lord South|ampton to Shake&s;peare, and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spen&s;er. Con&s;ider|ing the liberality for which our nation is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, it is re|markable, that not a &s;ingle Engli&s;h Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs: yet Spen&s;er had every claim to the bounty of Elizabeth; he &s;ung her prai&s;es in a &s;train which might gratify her pride; and of all who have flattered the great, he may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t worthy of reward. His &s;ong was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy, and the &s;ex of his idol may be &s;aid to purify his incen&s;e from all the offen&s;ive particles of &s;ervile adulation. The neglect which he ex|perienced from the vain, imperious, and ungrateful Elizabeth, appears the more &s;triking, when we recollect, that her lovely rival, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots, &s;ignalized her &s;uperior genero&s;ity by a magnificent pre&s;ent of plate to the French Poet Ron&s;ard. This neglected Bard was once the darling of France, and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received: his &s;overeign, Charles the Ninth, compo&s;ed &s;ome elegant ver&s;es in his prai&s;e, and the city of Toulou&s;e pre|&s;ented him with a Minerva of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="291">If our princes and nobles have not equalled tho&s;e of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country, England may yet boa&s;t the name of a private gentleman, who di&s;covered in this re&s;pect a mo&s;t princely &s;pirit; no nation, either ancient or modern, can produce an ex|ample of munificence more truly noble than the annual gratuity which Aken&s;ide received from Mr. Dy&s;on; a tribute of generous and affectionate admiration, endeared to its worthy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by every con&s;ideration which could make it honourable both to him&s;elf and to his patron!</P>
<P>It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accompli&s;hed writer, who had too much rea&s;on for the complaint, that
<Q>the profe&s;&s;ion of Literature, by far the mo&s;t laborious of any, leads to no real be|nefit.</Q>

<HEAD>NOTE I. VERSE 76.</HEAD>
<Q>THE loo&s;e Petronius gave the maxim birth.]</Q>
<P>Ari&s;totle has &s;aid but little, in his Poetics, concerning that weighty point, which has &s;o much employed and embarra&s;&s;ed the modern Critics&mdash;the machinery of the Epic poem; and the little which he has &s;aid might rather furni&s;h an argument for its exclu&s;ion, than ju&s;tify its u&s;e. But Rome, in her mo&s;t degenerate days, produced a writer, to who&s;e authority, contemp|tible as it is, mo&s;t frequent appeals have been made in this curious lite|rary que&s;tion. In almo&s;t every modern author who has touched, how|ever &s;lightly, on Epic poetry, we may find at lea&s;t &s;ome part of the following &s;entence from Petronius Arbiter:&mdash;Ecce, Belli civilis ingens opus qui&s;quis attigerit, ni&s;i plenus litteris, &s;ub onere labetur. Non enim res ge&s;tae ver&s;ibus comprehendendae &s;unt, quod longe melius hi&s;torici fa|ciunt; &s;ed per ambages, deorumque mini&s;teria, &amp; fabulo&s;um &s;ententi|arum tormentum praecipitandus e&s;t liber &s;piritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religio&s;ae orationis &s;ub te&s;tibus fides.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks on the nece&s;&s;ity of cele&s;tial agents, were evidently, made to depreciate the Phar&s;alia of Lucan; and Petronius may be called a fair Critic, as Pope &s;aid of Milbourne, on his oppo&s;ition to Dryden, becau&s;e he produces his own poetry in contra&s;t to that which he con|demns. His &s;pecimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem &s;hould be conducted, &s;ufficiently proves the ab&s;urdity of his cri|tici&s;m;
<PB N="294" REF="293">
for how in&s;ipid is the fable in tho&s;e ver&s;es which he has oppo&s;ed to the Phar&s;alia, when compared to the fir&s;t book of Lucan! Yet the Epic compo&s;ition of Petronius has not wanted admirers: a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to &s;ay, that he prefers this &s;ingle rhap&s;ody to three hundred volumes of &s;uch poetry as Lucan's: an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau,
<Q>Un &s;ot trouve toujours un plus &s;ot qui l'admire.</Q></P>
<P>If men of letters, in the age of Lucan, differed in their &s;entiments concerning machinery, the great changes that have &s;ince happened in the world, and the di&s;qui&s;itions which have appeared on the &s;ubject, are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article. Two eminent Critics of the pre&s;ent time have delivered opinions on this topic &s;o &s;ingularly oppo&s;ite to each other, that I &s;hall tran&s;cribe them both.</P>
<Q>In a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to introduce upon the &s;tage &s;uperior Beings in a vi&s;ible &s;hape. There is not place for &s;uch objection in an Epic poem; and Boileau, with many other Critics, declares &s;trongly for that fort of machinery in an Epic poem. But waving authority, which is apt to impo&s;e upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from rea&s;on. I begin with a preliminary remark, that this mat|ter is but indi&s;tinctly handled by Critics, The poetical privilege of animating in&s;en&s;ible objects for enlivening a de&s;cription, is very differ|ent from what is termed <HI>machinery,</HI> where deities, angels, devils, or other &s;upernatural powers, are introduced as real per&s;onages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the cata&s;trophe; and yet the&s;e two things are con&s;tantly jumbled together in the rea&s;oning. The former is founded on a natural principle; but can the latter claim the &s;ame authority? So far from it, that nothing is more unnatural. Its effects at the &s;ame time are deplorable. Fir&s;t, it gives an air of fiction to the whole, and prevents that impre&s;&s;ion of reality which is requi&s;ite to intere&s;t our affections, and to move our pa&s;&s;ions; which of it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to explode machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fanta&s;tic ta&s;te or irregular imagination.
<PB N="295" REF="294">
And next, were it po&s;&s;ible, by di&s;gui&s;ing the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an in&s;uperable objec|tion would &s;till remain, which is, that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is in|troduced; for an evident rea&s;on, that virtuous emotions cannot be rai&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully, but by the actions of tho&s;e who are endued with pa&s;&s;ions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions: and as for moral in&s;truction, it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the &s;ame principles with us. Homer, it is true, introduces the Gods into his fable; but the religion of his coun|try authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the Gods often interpo&s;e vi&s;ibly and bodily in human affairs. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of nature &s;eldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be reli&s;hed by any per&s;on of a correct ta&s;te. They may be of &s;ome u&s;e to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his &s;ubject, and making it intere&s;ting.&mdash;Voltaire, in his E&s;&s;ay upon Epic Poetry, talking of the Phar&s;alia, ob&s;erves judiciou&s;ly, that the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and Political, joined with the &s;olidity of Lucan's &s;ubject, deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction. Is it not amazing, that a Critic who rea&s;ons &s;o ju&s;tly with re&s;pect to others, can be &s;o blind with re&s;pect to him&s;elf? Voltaire, not &s;atisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invi&s;ible and &s;uperior Beings, introduces them into the action. In the &s;ixth canto of the Henriade, St. Louis appears in per&s;on, and terrifies the &s;oldiers; in the &s;eventh canto, St. Louis &s;ends the God of Sleep to Henry; and in the tenth, the demons of Di&s;cord, Fanatici&s;m, War, &amp;c. a&s;&s;i&s;t Aumale in a &s;ingle combat with Turenne, and are driven away by a good angel brandi&s;hing the &s;word of God. To blend &s;uch fictitious per&s;onages in the &s;ame action with. mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate, and is intolerable in a hi&s;tory &s;o recent as that of Henry IV. This &s;ingly is &s;ufficient to make the Henriade a &s;hort-lived poem, were it otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every beauty.
<BIBL><HI>Elements of Critici&s;m,</HI> vol. ii. p. 389, 4th. edition.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB N="296" REF="295">The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote. He did well therefore to &s;upply their room with An|gels and Devils. If the&s;e too &s;hould wear out of the popular creed (and they &s;eem in a hopeful way, from the liberty &s;ome late Critics have taken with them) I know not what other expedients the Epic Poet might have recour&s;e to; but this I know&mdash;the pomp of ver&s;e, the energy of de&s;cription, and even the fine&s;t moral paintings, would &s;tand him in no &s;tead. Without <HI>admiration</HI> (which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of cele&s;tial intervention, I mean the agency of &s;u|perior natures really exi&s;ting, or by the illu&s;ion of the fancy taken to be &s;o) no Epic poem can be long-lived. I am not afraid to in&s;tance in the Henriade it&s;elf, which, notwith&s;tanding the elegance of the com|po&s;ition, will in a &s;hort time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W. Davenant, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on.
<BIBL><HI>Letters on Chivalry and Romance,</HI> Letter X.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I have thus ventured to confront the&s;e eminent critical antagoni&s;ts, that, while they engage and overthrow each other, we may ob&s;erve the inju&s;tice produced by the &s;pirit of &s;y&s;tematical critici&s;m, even in authors mo&s;t re&s;pectable for their talents and erudition.&mdash;Here is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires, which equally de&s;troy him. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Critic a&s;&s;erts that the Henriade mu&s;t be &s;hort-lived, becau&s;e the Poet <HI>has introduced invi&s;ible and &s;uperior agents</HI>;&mdash;the <HI>&s;econd</HI> denounces the &s;ame fate again&s;t it, becau&s;e <HI>it wants</HI> the <HI>agency of &s;uperior natures:</HI> yet &s;urely every reader of poetry, who is not influenced by any particular &s;y&s;tem, will readily allow, that if Voltaire had treated his &s;ubject with true Epic &s;pirit in all other points, neither the introduction nor the ab&s;ence of St. Louis could be &s;ingly &s;ufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion. Indeed the learned author, who has &s;poken in &s;o peremptory a manner concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upernatural agents to pre&s;erve the exi&s;tence of an Epic poem, appears rather unfortunate in the two exam|ples by which he endeavours to &s;upport his doctrine; for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have &s;ufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot, without con&s;idering the article of Machinery.</P>
<P>If I have warmly oppo&s;ed any deci&s;ions of this exalted Critic, it is
<PB N="297" REF="296">
from a per&s;ua&s;ion (in which I may perhaps be mi&s;taken) that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his maxims have a &s;trong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both; an art on which his genius and learning have ca&s;t <HI>many</HI> rays of plea&s;ing and of u&s;eful light.</P>

<Q>And &s;potle&s;s Laurels in that field be won.]</Q>
<P>The Indian mythology, as it has lately been illu&s;trated in the writings of Mr. Holwell, is finely calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of any poetical genius who may wi&s;h to introduce new machinery into the &s;erious Epic Poem. Be&s;ides the powerful charm of novelty, it would have the advantage of not cla&s;hing with our national religion; for the endeavours of Mr. Holwell to re|concile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t, have &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that if his &s;y&s;tem does not &s;atisfy a theo|logi&s;t, it certainly affords a &s;ufficient ba&s;is for the &s;tructure of a Poet. In peru&s;ing his account of the Indian &s;cripture, every reader of imagina|tion may, I think, perceive, that the Sha&s;tah might &s;upply a poetical &s;pirit with as rich a ma&s;s of ideal trea&s;ure as fancy could with to work upon.&mdash;An Epic Poet, de&s;irous of laying the &s;cene of his action in India, would be more embarra&s;&s;ed to find intere&s;ting Heroes than proper Divi|nities. &mdash;Had ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity in&s;pired and guided that Engli&s;h valour, which has &s;ignalized it&s;elf on the plains of Indo&s;tan; had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppre&s;&s;ive u&s;urpation of the Mahometan powers; &s;uch exploits would pre&s;ent to the Epic Mu&s;e a &s;ubject truly noble, and the mytholo|gy of the Ea&s;t might enrich it with the mo&s;t &s;plendid decorations. Whether it be po&s;&s;ible or not to find &s;uch a &s;ubject in the records of our Indian hi&s;tory, I leave the reader to determine.&mdash;Our great Hi&s;torian of the Roman empire has intimated, in a note to the fir&s;t volume of his immortal work, that
<Q>the wonderful expedition of Odin, which deduces
<PB N="298" REF="297">
the enmity of the Goths and Romans from &s;o memorable a cau&s;e, might &s;upply the noble ground-work of an Epic poem.</Q>
The idea is cer|tainly both ju&s;t and &s;plendid. Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in &s;uch a work, he would probably have convinced us, that the Northern mythology has &s;till &s;ufficient power to &s;eize and enchant the imagina|tion, as much in Epic as in Lyric compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It may amu&s;e our &s;peculative Critics, to con&s;ider how far the <HI>religious Gothic fables</HI> &s;hould be introduced or rejected, to render &s;uch a per|formance mo&s;t intere&s;ting to a modern reader. Few judges would agree in their &s;entiments on the que&s;tion; and perhaps the great di&s;pute con|cerning Machinery cannot be fairly adju&s;ted, till &s;ome happy genius &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s ambition and per&s;everance enough to execute two Epic poems, in the one adopting, and in the other rejecting, &s;upernatural agents; for Rea&s;on alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of Fancy; and in the poetical as well as the philo&s;ophical world, experi|ment is the &s;ure&s;t guide to truth.</P>
