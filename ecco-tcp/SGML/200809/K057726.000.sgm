<HEAD>To Mr. WM. SHIELD, Compo&s;er to the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GIL BLAS advi&s;ed a friend who had written for the &s;tage with &s;ucce&s;s, to publi&s;h his works, ob&s;erving that as he had impo&s;ed upon the public by the repre&s;entation of bad pieces, he ought to open their eyes in gratitude for the reception they had met. This Opera, I fear, like the works of the Spani&s;h dramati&s;t, tho' applauded on the &s;tage, may fall under cen&s;ure in the clo&s;et, where it mu&s;t appear dive&s;ted of that aid it received from your excellent mu&s;ical compo&s;itions, and the incom|parable acting with which the characters were &s;upported. The three principal ideas which combine the &s;ubject are not original, but bor|rowed from the ballads of <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> the <HI>Nut|brown Maid,</HI> and the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Hermit of the Dale</HI> is taken from a ballad called, the <HI>Friar of orders Grey,</HI> which is taken from an old ballad called the <HI>Herd&s;man.</HI></NOTE><HI>Hermit of the Dale</HI>: I adopted them as being popular. It was my fir&s;t intention to have taken all the &s;ongs from old ballads; tho&s;e I have &s;elected are, I tru&s;t, not ill cho&s;en, or unapplicable to the piece. ROBIN HOOD and his merry Archers have often been upon the Stage. The <HI>Biographia Dramatica</HI> gives an account of &s;ix pieces in which this celebrated outlaw was the hero, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Sad Shepherd</HI> by Ben John&s;on; but it does not appear that any of them met with &s;ucce&s;s. I addre&s;s the&s;e ob&s;ervations to you, as a tribute to your merit; happy in having an opportunity of publicly a&s;&s;uring you, that no man &s;tands higher in my e&s;teem. Your friend,</P>

<PB N="7" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Now this was all owing to the bi&s;hop of Hereford, who maliciou&s;ly poi&s;oned the royal ear, and the in&s;tant the noble Huntingdon became an object of the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, the whole court tribe, even the very caterpillars who fed upon his bounty avoided him as if he was contagious.</P>

<P>Not much. We met a monk, who de|nied having ca&s;h, but Robin forced him to pray to his titular &s;aint for &s;ome, and after five minutes devo|tion, on &s;earching his reverence, we found twenty broad pieces in his hood; but the money did not remain long with us: falling with one of the bi&s;hop of Hereford's tenants, who was flying from his ha|bitation, being unable to pay his rent, Robin, with his accu&s;tomed humanity, made him a pre|&s;ent of the Friar's tribute.</P>

<P>You have my thanks; but I mu&s;t re|fu&s;e your generous offer.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stella.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think &s;o too; for he &s;trews thyme under my window, when he thinks I do not &s;ee him; and when he gathers wild &s;trawberries, or filberts, or finds honeycombs in the woods, he al|ways pre&s;ents them to me untouched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is as much difference between John and Scarlet, as between an hone&s;t man and a knave. I know they are both your admirers, but be cautious in be&s;towing your affection; you are very young, Stella; and love, my girl, has its bitters as well as &s;weets.</P>

<P>SO, after all my boa&s;ting, I have lo&s;t my way; but that is common with men of genius, and women of genius too. There is your great ora|tor; he often leaves the plain road of truth, to wander in the labyrinth of fal&s;ehood. Then your prude, perhaps, after walking years in the &s;treight paths of virtue, trips in her gait, and, &s;tumbling, falls upon a bed of thorns.
<Q>Few people pur&s;ue the tract Nature de&s;igned them&mdash;therefore we find politicians without brains, magi&s;trates with|out ju&s;tice, noblemen without honour, traders without hone&s;ty, philo&s;ophers without morality, and churchmen without religion.</Q>&mdash;</P>
