<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Compositions, which I have dignified with the title of <HI>Moral Tales,</HI> have been the employment of several leisure hours, at different periods of time. Some of them have been written many years, as the respective dates specify, but none of them printed till now, except the last in the second volume, of which further mention shall be made in its proper place.</P>
<P>Mr. ADDISON describes himself, as al|ways being possessed of a disposition to exa|mine such old prints and ballads as he saw pasted upon the walls of cottages, &amp;c. I have not only discovered the same turn in myself, (and I would I could find something else
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
more similar to that excellent writer!) but I have ever, even from childhood, felt my at|tention peculiarly engaged by stories re|lated in company, which have contained in them any thing of the marvellous and su|pernatural. Hence it is, probably, that I have so long retained many of the singular events whereon the ensuing compositions are founded.</P>
<P>I have been (I can say it with great truth) repeatedly urged to publish them by friends, who have seen the manuscripts.&mdash;The Reader, perhaps, will call them very <HI>partial</HI> friends: it may be so. And I am ready to acknowledge that, after a careful revisal, they are much better calculated to elicit the approbation of a kind heart, than to obtain the commendation of a critical judgment.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1771. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The event, whereon this Tale is founded, occurred at Margate, in Kent, in the year 1765.

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>THE noon-tide sun with fervid beams</L>
<L>Now gilded ev'ry hill,</L>
<L>When MARIAN sought the willow shade</L>
<L>Beside the ripling rill;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>There, as she ply'd the needle's task,</L>
<L>Her bosom throbb'd with woe,</L>
<L>And down her faded cheek full oft</L>
<L>Tears trickled soft and slow.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="62" REF="60">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>And often, as she rais'd her eyes</L>
<L>Athwart the distant mead,</L>
<L>And mark'd the entrance of the wood,</L>
<L>Her heart with anguish bled;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>For there she trac'd her WILLIAM's steps,</L>
<L>As he pursu'd his way,</L>
<L>Full lightly to the neighb'ring town,</L>
<L>By morning's ruddy ray,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>To sell the produce of his land,</L>
<L>Of grain a plenteous store;</L>
<L>She saw him enter in the wood,</L>
<L>But never saw him more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Now five afflicting years had past,</L>
<L>Since she began to mourn</L>
<L>The father of her ALLEYNE dear,</L>
<L>Who never did return.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<PB N="63" REF="61">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>ALLEYNE, who knew his mother's wont,</L>
<L>When morn's hard toil was o'er,</L>
<L>Would duly, to appease her grief,</L>
<L>Her pensive haunts explore.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Full fifteen years had crown'd the youth,</L>
<L>His form of promise rare,</L>
<L>And comely was he to the view,</L>
<L>And dutiful as fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Daily he grew in the esteem</L>
<L>Of Pastor, Knight, and Squire,</L>
<L>And oft a casual dole obtain'd,</L>
<L>To mend his scanty hire.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Soon as beneath the willow's shade</L>
<L>His mother he descries,</L>
<L>And views her pond'ring o'er the stream</L>
<L>With swoll'n and wat'ry eyes,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<PB N="64" REF="62">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>He seats him gently by her side,</L>
<L>And thus he soothes her woe:</L>
<L>"Must then this trickling tide of grief</L>
<L>"For ever, ever flow?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>"And never will the hand of Time</L>
<L>"Abate my mother's pain?</L>
<L>"Ne'er shall the smiles she us'd to wear</L>
<L>"On ALLEYNE shine again?"</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Ah! can'st thou marvel," MARIAN cries,</L>
<L>"That thus my sorrows flow?</L>
<L>"Too well, thou know'st, my dearest son,</L>
<L>"My cause for constant woe;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>"Just such a bright and fervid sun</L>
<L>"As this, enrich'd the plain,</L>
<L>"When WILLIAM left thy mother's side,</L>
<L>"But ne'er return'd again.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="65" REF="63">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>"With him we lost the richest crop,</L>
<L>"That e'er our glebe bestow'd,</L>
<L>"Since when, thou know'st, bleak indigence</L>
<L>"Hath made with us abode."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>"Too well, I know," the boy replies,</L>
<L>"Why thus thy sorrows flow,</L>
<L>"Young as I am, I sore regret</L>
<L>"And I partake thy woe:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>"Yet these continual streaming tears</L>
<L>"My mother's health consume;</L>
<L>"And lillies sit upon that cheek,</L>
<L>"Where once the rose did bloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Assuage thy grief, nor let despair</L>
<L>"Thy gentle heart invade,</L>
<L>"Since God doth give me daily strength</L>
<L>"To lend my mother aid:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<PB N="66" REF="64">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>"And late and early will I toil,</L>
<L>"So thou may'st peace enjoy."</L>
<L>Through tears she smil'd, and close embrac'd</L>
<L>Her ALLEYNE, her <HI>good Boy.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>Smiles were the only answer made,</L>
<L>She had not power to speak,</L>
<L>But, in complacent silence, wip'd</L>
<L>The drops from off her cheek.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>And duteous ALLEYNE kept his word,</L>
<L>He early toll'd and late,</L>
<L>And God bestow'd him daily strength</L>
<L>To mend their poor estate.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>His toils were bless'd; each harvest home</L>
<L>Increas'd their little store,</L>
<L>And in his twentieth year he saw</L>
<L>Want banish'd from their door.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<PB N="67" REF="65">
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Now (woe the while!) his honest heart</L>
<L>Play'd truant from his breast,</L>
<L>And sore he long'd in nuptial tye</L>
<L>With LUCY to be blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>LUCY, a neighbour farmer's pride,</L>
<L>Who lov'd alike the youth,</L>
<L>For she had long with pleasure mark'd</L>
<L>His early grace and truth.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Each guess'd the pain the other felt,</L>
<L>Yet each that pain conceal'd,</L>
<L>For ALLEYNE made his own desires</L>
<L>To filial duty yield.</L>

<L>More fell than all the savage race,</L>

<L>Remember how with chearful strain</L>

<L>Exulting madly o'er their prey,</L>
