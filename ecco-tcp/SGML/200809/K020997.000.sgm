<L>The &s;cythe of Ruin from the hand of Time,</L>

<L>Models of grace &s;o exqui&s;itely fair.</L>
<L>While you, whom Painting thus in&s;pir'd to roam,</L>
<L N="10">Bring the&s;e rich &s;tores of ripen'd judgment home;</L>
<L>While now, attending my accompli&s;h'd friend,</L>
<L>Science and Ta&s;te his &s;often'd colours blend;</L>
<L>Let the fond Mu&s;e, tho' with a tran&s;ient view,</L>
<L>The progre&s;s of her &s;i&s;ter art pur&s;ue;</L>
<L N="15"><PB N="4" REF="6">Eager in tracing from remote&s;t time</L>
<L>The &s;teps of Painting through each favour'd clime,</L>

But as the beauties and advantages of this plan &s;truck forcibly on the imagination of this amiable Author, the infinite diffi|culties attending its execution were likewi&s;e fully open to his di&s;cern|ment. The &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t depend on the choice of &s;ubject: where that is not very happily adapted, the picture will probably contain &s;ome mo&s;t ridiculous ab&s;urdities&mdash;Perhaps the Reader may recollect an unfortu|nate in&s;tance or two of this kind.</P>

"Nero had ordered him&s;elf to be painted under the fi|gure of a Colo&s;&s;us, upon cloth or canva&s;s, a hundred and twenty feet in height." The &s;ame author informs us, that this prepo&s;terous pic|ture, when it was fini&s;hed, met with its fate from lightning, which con&s;umed it, and involved likewi&s;e the mo&s;t beautiful part of the gar|dens where it was placed in the conflagration.

The two arti&s;ts had agreed to exchange their own portraits, and Raphael, on receiving his friend's picture, addre&s;&s;es him in the following words:</P>

<P><HI>In&s;pir'd by thee, the &s;oft Corinthian Maid.</HI>] Pliny has tran&s;mitted to us the Hi&s;tory of the Maid of Corinth and her father. "Dibutades, a potter of Sicyon, fir&s;t formed likene&s;&s;es in clay at Corinth, but was indebted to his daughter for the invention; the girl being in love with a young man who was &s;oon going from her into &s;ome remote country, traced out the lines of his face from his &s;hadow upon the wall by candle-light. Her father, filling up the lines with clay, formed a bu&s;t, and hardened it in the fire with the re&s;t of his earthen ware." Plin. Lib. 35.</P>
<P>Athenagoras, the Athenian philo&s;opher, gives a &s;imilar account of this curious and entertaining anecdote, adding the circum&s;tance that the youth was &s;leeping when the likene&s;s was taken from his &s;hadow. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>The &s;ame writer, who lived in the &s;econd century of the Chri&s;tian aera, informs us that this monument of ancient art was extant at Co|rinth in his time, though Pliny &s;eems to intimate that it did not &s;urvive the taking of that city by Mummius.</P>
<P>In the Poe&s;ies de Fontenelle there is an epi&s;tle from the Maid of Co|rinth, whom the author calls Dibutadis, to her imaginary lover Pole|mon. She de&s;cribes her own work in the following Stanzas:</P>

<P><HI>'Twas then Panaeus drew, with freedom's train.</HI>] Panaeus was the brother of Phidias, the celebrated Sculptor, whom he is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his noble&s;t works. Pau&s;anias, in his Fifth Book, gives an ac|count of &s;everal pictures by this early Arti&s;t, and particularly of the picture here alluded to. It was painted in the celebrated portico called <GAP DESC="foreign">, Poecile.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a general repre&s;entation of the conflict, the flight of the barbarians, and a di&s;tant view of their &s;hips, The&s;eus, Minerva, and Hercules were, according to this author, exhibited in the piece. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous figures among the per&s;ons engaged were Calli|machus, and Miltiades, and a hero called Echetlus: he mentions al&s;o
<PB N="61" REF="63">
another hero, who is introduced into the picture, called Marathon, from whom, he &s;ays, the field had its name.</P>
<P>Pau&s;anias, fol. Lip. 1696. p. 37.</P>
<P>From Pliny's account of the &s;ame picture we learn that the heads of the generals were portraits&mdash;adeo jam colorum u&s;us percrebuerat, adeoque ars perfecta erat ut in eo Praelio ICONICOS duces pinxi&s;&s;e tradatur.&mdash; Plin. Lib. 35. c. 8.</P>

<P><HI>There Polygnotus, &s;corning &s;ervile hire.</HI>] Of the talents of Polyg|notus much honourable mention is made by many of the be&s;t authors of antiquity, as Ari&s;totle and Plutarch, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is, &amp;c. Pau&s;anias &s;peaks of the pictures here alluded to, and in his Tenth Book, introduces a very long de&s;cription of other pictures by the &s;ame arti&s;t, painted al&s;o from Homer in the Temple at Delphos. The pa&s;&s;age however gives but a confu&s;ed and imperfect idea of the painter's performance. How much the art is indebted to this ancient ma&s;ter, what grace and &s;oftne&s;s he gave to the human countenance, what embelli&s;hments he added to the female figure and dre&s;s, are much more happily de&s;cribed by Pliny. Primus Mulieres lucid&acirc; ve&s;te pinxit, capita earum mitris ver&s;icoloribus operuit, pluri|mumque picturae primus contulit: &s;iquidem in&s;tituit os adaperire, dentes o&s;tendere, vultum ab antiquo rigore variare. The &s;ame author likewi&s;e bears honourable te&s;timony to the liberal &s;pirit of this great arti&s;t, who refu&s;ed any reward for his ingenious labours in the por|tico.

<P><HI>Thy tragic pencil, Ari&s;tides, caught.</HI>] The city of Thebes had the honour of giving birth to this celebrated Arti&s;t. He was the fir&s;t, according to Pliny, who expre&s;&s;ed Character and Pa&s;&s;ion, the Human Mind, and its &s;everal emotions; but he was not remarkable for &s;oft|ne&s;s of colouring. "His mo&s;t celebrated picture was of an infant (on the taking of a town) at the mother's brea&s;t, who is wounded and expiring. The &s;en&s;ations of the mother were clearly marked, and her fear lea&s;t the child, upon failure of the milk, &s;hould &s;uck her blood." "Alexander the Great," continues the &s;ame author, "took this picture with him to Pella."</P>
<P>It is highly probable, according to the conjecture of Junius, (in his learned Treati&s;e de Pictur&acirc; Veterum) that the following beautiful epigram of Aemilianus was written on this exqui&s;ite picture:

The &s;ame author contradicts on this occa&s;ion a &s;imilar fal&s;ehood concerning the great Michael Angelo, which was fir&s;t circu|lated from the pulpit by an ignorant prie&s;t, as we learn from Gori's Hi&s;torical Annotations to the Life of M.

<P><HI>And thou, Vela&s;quez, &s;hare the honour due.</HI>] Don Diego Vela&s;quez de Silva, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the Spani&s;h Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and &s;plendid life at Madrid in 1660.&mdash;His ma&s;ter was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the &s;i&s;ter arts of Painting and Poetry.&mdash;Vela&s;quez was patronized by the fa|mous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the Fir&s;t, during his vi&s;it at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a little to form the ta&s;te and pa&s;&s;ion for art, by which that Prince was &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed. The Spani&s;h Painter ro&s;e to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the &s;ingular fortune to unite the character of an Amba&s;&s;ador with that of an Arti&s;t, being &s;ent on an extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</P>
<P>One of his mo&s;t &s;triking hi&s;torical pictures, was the expul&s;ion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national &s;ubject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in competition with three Arti&s;ts of reputation, and obtained the preference.</P>
<P>But he is particularly celebrated for the &s;pirit and energy of his Por|traits; concerning which there are two &s;ingular anecdotes related by his Spani&s;h Biographer; and the following may po&s;&s;ibly amu&s;e the reader.</P>
<P>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Com|mander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and plea&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the picture; a circum&s;tance not u&s;ual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the &s;ake of working at a greater di&s;tance, and with peculiar force; &s;o that the picture (&s;ays my Spani&s;h author) when near, is not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, and at a di&s;tance is a miracle. As Vela&s;guez,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
after this Portrait was fini&s;hed, was at work in the palace, the King, as u&s;ual, went privately to his apartment to &s;ee him paint; when ob&s;erving the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real per&s;on, he exclaimed with &s;urprize, <Q>What! are you &s;till here? have you not your di&s;patches? and why are you not gone?</Q> But &s;oon perceiv|ing his mi&s;take, he turn'd to Vela&s;quez (who mode&s;tly doubted the reality of the deception) and &s;aid, "I prote&s;t to you it deceived me." For this &s;tory, &s;uch as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preceding Note.

This honour however has been brought into que&s;tion&mdash;Germany made a &s;trong, but un&s;ucce&s;sful effort to rob Holland of the glory which &s;he derives from the fir&s;t invention of Printing: and Painting in oil (it has been &s;aid) was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck, or John of Bruges, as he is commonly called; to whom that di&s;covery is generally a&s;cribed, about the year 1410.&mdash;But Va&s;ari, in his Life of Antonello da Me&s;&s;ina, relates very particularly the circum&s;tances
<PB N="80" REF="82">
of Van Eyck's invention, and the &s;ub&s;equent introduction of the &s;e|cret into Italy. A mo&s;t learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has &s;uppo&s;ed that Van Eyck might po&s;&s;ibly "learn the &s;ecret of u&s;ing oil in England, and take the honour of the inven|tion to him&s;elf, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at lei&s;ure, from the confu&s;ion of the times, to claim the di&s;covery of &s;uch a &s;ecret."&mdash;Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, Vol. I. p. 29.&mdash;The conjecture is not without &s;ome little founda|tion;&mdash;but the conjectural claims which either Italy or England can produce to this excellent invention, are by no means &s;ufficiently &s;trong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious Fleming.</P>
<P>Since the preceding part of this Note was written, the reputa|tion both of Van Eyck, and his encomia&s;t Va&s;ari, has been very for|cibly attacked in an E&s;&s;ay on Oil-painting, by Mr. Ra&s;pe; an E&s;&s;ay which di&s;covers &s;uch a zealous attachment to the arts, and &s;uch an active pur&s;uit of knowledge, as do great credit to its ingenious au|thor.

His talents as a painter are univer&s;ally celebrated; but his &s;ocial virtues, though perhaps not inferior, are far from being &s;o generally known. In the "Raccolta di Lettere &s;ulla Pittura" there are many of his letters to his intimate friend Ricciardi, an Italian poet, and profe&s;&s;or of moral philo&s;ophy at Pi&s;a, which perfectly di&s;|play the warmth of his friend&s;hip, and the genero&s;ity of his heart.&mdash; They contain al&s;o &s;ome amu&s;ing anecdotes relating to his profe&s;&s;ion, and the great delight which he took in di&s;covering hi&s;torical &s;ubjects of a peculiar ca&s;t, untouched by other painters, and appearing to an ignorant eye almo&s;t beyond the limits of his art.

mixing his colours, and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other; that is, in&s;tead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, u&s;ing oil only fully &s;tained with it, to which a proper con&s;i&s;tence (or body as the painters call it) is given by &s;trong gum varni&s;hes; in &s;hort, u&s;ing more vehicle than colour; by which, al|though mo&s;t brilliant and tran&s;parent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and con&s;equently le&s;s able to with&s;tand the de&s;tructive action of light.

His di&s;cour&s;es, not merely calculated for the improvement of the young arti&s;ts to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed, contain all the principles of true and univer&s;al ta&s;te, em|belli&s;hed with great brilliancy of imagination, and with equal force of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><HI>Thy Ugolino, &amp;c.</HI>] As the &s;ubject of this admirable picture is taken from a poet &s;o little known to the Engli&s;h reader as Dante, it may not perhaps be impertinent to &s;ay, that in Richard&s;on's Di&s;cour&s;e on the Science of a Connoi&s;&s;eur, there is a tran&s;lation of the &s;tory in Engli&s;h blank ver&s;e. A young and noble author, now living, has obliged the world with a tran&s;lation of it in rhyme.&mdash;As to the pic|ture, no arti&s;t could expre&s;s more happily the wild and &s;ublime &s;pirit of the poet from whom he drew. We may ju&s;tly apply to him the com|pliment which a lively Italian addre&s;&s;ed to a great man of his own country, but of far inferior expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><HI>Now Art exults, with annual Triumphs gay.</HI>] While we are de|lighted with the increa&s;ing &s;plendor of the&s;e annual entertainments, it is but ju&s;t to remember, that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our fir&s;t public exhibition of Paintings. The dif|ferent &s;ocieties of arti&s;ts &s;oon followed &s;o excellent an example; and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highe&s;t honour on this happy in&s;titution. Our exhibitions at once af|ford both the be&s;t nur&s;ery for the protection of infant genius, and the noble&s;t field for the di&s;play of accompli&s;hed merit: nor do they only admini&s;ter to the benefit of the arti&s;t, and the plea&s;ure of the publick: they have &s;till a more exalted tendency; and when national &s;ubjects are painted with dignity and force, our exhibitions may ju&s;tly be regarded as &s;chools of public virtue. Perhaps the young &s;oldier can never be more warmly animated to the &s;ervice of his country, than by gazing, with the delighted public, on a &s;ublime picture of the expiring hero, who died with glory in her defence. But, not to dwell on their power of in&s;piring martial enthu&s;ia&s;m, our exhibitions may be &s;aid to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of tho&s;e, who fill the different departments of more tranquil life. In &s;upport of this &s;entiment I beg leave to tran&s;cribe the following judi|cious remark from an author, who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and &s;pirited E&s;&s;ays. "They, who&s;e natural feelings have been properly improved by culture, nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world, know from experi|ence, how the heart is mollified, the manners poli&s;hed, and the tem|per &s;weetened, by a well-directed &s;tudy of the arts of imitation. The &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility of artificial excellence, extends it&s;elf to the per|ception of natural and moral beauty; and the &s;tudent returns from the arti&s;t's gallery to his &s;tation in &s;ociety, with a brea&s;t more di&s;|po&s;ed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of &s;ocial life, and of reciprocal benevolence."&mdash;KNOX's E&s;&s;ays, moral and literary, 1778, p. 264, on Sculpture.</P>

<P><HI>Thy Talents, Hogarth! &amp;c.</HI>] William Hogarth was born in London, 1698, and put apprentice to an engraver of the mo&s;t ordinary cla&s;s; but his comic talents, which are &s;aid to have appeared fir&s;t in the prints to Hudibras, &s;oon rai&s;ed him to fame and fortune.&mdash;He married a daughter of Sir James Thornhill, and died 1764.&mdash;The peculiar merits of his pencil are unque&s;tionable. His Analy&s;is of Beauty has been found more open to di&s;pute; but however the greater adepts in the &s;cience may differ on its principles, it may certainly be called an honourable monument of his genius and application.</P>

<P><HI>Who&s;e needy Titian calls for ill-paid gold.</HI>] Richard&s;on has fallen into a mi&s;take concerning the famous Danae, and other pictures of Titian, which he &s;ays (in quoting a letter of Titian's without con|&s;idering its addre&s;s) were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England, a tyrant indeed, voluptuous, and cruel, but &s;till le&s;s dete&s;table than the &s;ullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain, who filled up the mea&s;ure of his &s;uperior guilt by the horrid a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his &s;on. Philip, on his marriage with Mary, a&s;&s;umed the title of King of Eng|land; and to him Titian addre&s;&s;ed the letter, which &s;peaks of the pic|tures in que&s;tion: the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron.</P>
<P>His &s;ollicitude to en&s;ure his protection and favour is &s;trongly mark|ed in the following &s;hort pa&s;&s;age of a letter which he addre&s;&s;ed to one of Philip's attendants. "Mando ora la poe&s;ia di Venere e Adone, nella quale V. S. vedr&agrave;, quanto &s;pirito e amore &s;o mettere nell' opere di &s;ua Mae&s;t&agrave;."&mdash;Raccolta, tom. ii. p. 21.</P>
<P>How poorly this great arti&s;t was rewarded for his ill-directed la|bour, appears very forcibly in a long letter of complaint, which he had &s;pirit enough to addre&s;s to the king on the many hard&s;hips he &s;uffered in being unable to obtain the payment of the pen&s;ion which

had been granted to him by the emperor Charles the Vth.&mdash;Rac|colta, tom. ii. p. 379.</P>

<P><HI>Bid Engli&s;h pencils honour Engli&s;h worth.</HI>] The great encouragement given our painters to &s;elect &s;ubjects from Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, has of late years been very ob&s;ervable.

<P><HI>Her wounded Sidney, Bayard's perfect peer.</HI>] The gallant, the amiable and accompli&s;hed Sir Philip Sidney may be ju&s;tly placed on a level with the noble Bayard, "Le Chevalier &s;ans peur &amp; &s;ans re|proche." who&s;e glory has of late received new lu&s;tre from the pen of Robert&s;on and the pencil of We&s;t. The &s;triking &s;cene here alluded to, which preceded the death of Sidney, has not yet, I believe, appeared upon canva&s;s, but is forcibly de&s;cribed by the noble and enthu&s;ia&s;tic friend of Sidney, the Lord Brooke.&mdash;See Biograph. Britan. Art. Sidney.</P>
<P>The particulars al&s;o are minutely de&s;cribed, and with great feeling, in a letter from his uncle Leice&s;ter to Sir Thomas Heneage, quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidnies. The tide of national admiration flowed very &s;trong in favour of Sidney, when Mr. Walpole, in &s;peak|ing of Lord Brooke, appeared to check the current; but the merits of Sidney are &s;ufficient to bear down all oppo&s;ition.&mdash;In&s;tead of joining the elegant author I have mentioned, in con&s;idering Sir Philip Sidney as "an a&s;toni&s;hing object of temporary admiration," I am &s;urprized that &s;o judicious an author &s;hould ever que&s;tion &s;o fair a title to univer&s;al regard. The learning and munificence, the courage
<PB N="94" REF="96">
and courte&s;y of Sidney endeared him to every rank, and he ju&s;tly challenges the la&s;ting affection of his country from the clo&s;ing &s;cene of his life, in which heroi&s;m and humanity are &s;o beautifully blended. I never can think this accompli&s;hed character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance (in which however there are many touches of exqui&s;ite beauty and &s;pirit) to amu&s;e a mo&s;t amiable &s;i&s;ter, whom he tenderly loved; or by his having threatened an unworthy &s;ervant of his father's with death in a ha&s;ty billet, merely to intimi|date and deter him from the future commi&s;&s;ion of an infamous breach of tru&s;t, in opening his letters.</P>

<P><HI>Th' heroic Daughter of the virtuous More.</HI>] Margaret, elde&s;t daugh|ter of the celebrated Sir Thomas More. The &s;cene which I have propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject of a picture, is taken from the following pa&s;|&s;age in Ballard:</P>
<P>"After Sir Thomas More was beheaded, &s;he took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St. Peter's ad Vincula, within the precincts of the Tower, and afterwards &s;he procured his corp&s;e to be removed, and buried in the chancel of the church at Chel&s;ea, as Sir Thomas More, in his life-time, had appointed. His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge, and being to be ca&s;t into the Thames to make room for others, &s;he bought it. For this &s;he was &s;ummoned before the council, as the &s;ame author relates, and behaved with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s, ju&s;tify|ing her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety. She was, however, impri&s;oned, but &s;oon relea&s;ed, and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-&s;ix, was buried at St. Dun&s;tan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which &s;he had pre&s;erved with religious veneration, in a box of lead, was, at her particular re|que&s;t, committed with her to the grave. It was &s;een &s;tanding on her coffin in the year 1715, when the vault of the Roper (her hu&s;band's) family was opened."&mdash;See Ballard's Memoirs of learned Ladies, p. 36.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Ad|di&s;on and Walpole.&mdash;She married, at the age of twenty, William Roper, E&s;quire, of Kent, to the infinite &s;atisfaction of her father; for &s;he &s;eems to have been the deare&s;t object of his parental affection, which is very &s;trongly marked in his letters addre&s;&s;ed to her. She was indeed mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by her learning, in an age, when the graces of the mind were regarded as an e&s;&s;ential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a &s;till &s;perior lu&s;tre on this accompli&s;hed woman.&mdash;There is more than one pa&s;&s;age in her life, which would furni&s;h an admirable &s;ub|ject for the pencil. Her interview with her father, on his return to the Tower, is mentioned as &s;uch by Mr. Walpole.</P>

<P><HI>But, oh! how poor the pro&s;trate Satan lies.</HI>] It is remarkable, that the greate&s;t painters have failed in this particular. Raphael, Guido, and We&s;t, are all deficient in the figure of Satan. Richard&s;on ob|&s;erves, in his de&s;cription of the pictures of Italy,&mdash;"Je n'ai jamais vu d'aucun Ma&icirc;tre une repre&s;entation du Diable, prince des Diables, qui me &s;atisfit." Page 500.</P>
<P>In recommending this &s;ubject to the pencil, it may be proper to ob|&s;erve, that it is not only extremely difficult, but even attended with danger, if we credit the following curious anecdote, in a medical writer of great reputation:&mdash;Spinello, fameux Peintre To&s;can, ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles, donna des traits &s;i terribles &agrave; Lucifer, qu'il en fut lui-meme &s;ai&s;i d'horreur, &amp; tout le re&s;te de &s;a vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui reprocher de l'avoir repre&s;ent&eacute; &s;ous une figure &s;i hidieu&s;e.&mdash;Ti&s;&s;ot de la Sant&eacute; des Gens de Lettres.</P>
<P>As this &s;tory is &s;o &s;ingular, it may amu&s;e &s;ome readers to &s;ee it in the words of Va&s;ari, from whom Ti&s;&s;ot &s;eems to have taken it.&mdash; The Italian Biographer &s;ays, in de&s;cribing a picture by Spinello Areti|no,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
who flouri&s;hed in the clo&s;e of the 14th century, Si vede un Lucifero gia mutato in be&s;tia brutti&s;&s;ima. E &s;i compiacque tanto Spi|nello di farlo orribile, e contraffatto, che &s;i dice (tanto puo alcuna fiata l'immaginazione) che la detta figura da lui dipinta gl'apparue in &s;ogno domandandolo, doue egli l'hauve&s;&s;e veduta &s;i brutta e per che fattole tale &s;corno con i &s;uoi pennelli: E che egli &s;vegliato&s;i dal &s;onno, per la paura, non potendo gridare, con tremito grandi&s;&s;imo &s;i &s;co&s;&s;e di maniera che la moglie de&s;tata&s;i lo &s;occor&s;e: ma niente di manco fu per cio a ri&s;chio, &s;tringendogli il cuore, di morir&s;i per cotale acci|dente, &s;ubitamente.
