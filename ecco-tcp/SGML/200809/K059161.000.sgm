<P><HI>_KAra Selym Oglan,</HI> Merchant of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> is by Birth an <HI>Armenian</HI> of the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Geor|gia,</HI> on the Confines of <HI>Per|&s;ia;</HI> he was born of <HI>Chri&s;ti|an Parents,</HI> of the <HI>Greek Church:</HI> But being taken away young by his Mother's Brother, and carry'd into <HI>Alep|po;</HI> he was then bred a <HI>Mahometan:</HI> And his &s;aid Unkle being a very con&s;iderable Merchant, he remov'd him afterwards to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Here he liv'd &s;ome Years in a flouri&s;hing Condition; and his Wealth and Commerce encrea&s;ing, and having contracted an Ac|quaintance with &s;ome of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French Turkey</HI> Merchants, he re&s;olv'd to tra|vel. He took his fir&s;t Tour thro' <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> going in the Habit of an <HI>Ar|menian Merchant,</HI> or as we vulgarly &s;tile them, a <HI>Grecian;</HI> and at length, with two of his Brothers, he &s;ettled in <HI>Holland;</HI> where he grew in Wealth and general Corre&s;pon|dence, to an exceeding Degree.</P>
<P>His Occa&s;ions, or his Curio&s;ity, led him at length to come over to <HI>England;</HI> where, it &s;eems, by the Tenour of his Corre&s;pondence, he re&s;ided when &s;ome very late Affairs were tran&s;acting; and which is more remarkable, he was, it &s;eems, an Eye-Witne&s;s of the late remarkable Church-Quarrel between two Chri&s;tian <HI>Mufti's,</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> as he calls them; from whence, whether he went over to <HI>Holland</HI> him&s;elf, or wrote to his Brothers to convey the following Letter to the <HI>Mufti</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> is not e&s;&s;ential to the Story: But the Letter it &s;elf, as it came to our Hands, is as follows:</P>

<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P><HI>KAra Selym,</HI> the meane&s;t of the Slaves of the invincible Emperor of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> Re|&s;iding in the Land of Unbelievers: <HI>To thee, venerable</HI> Muli Ibrahim ESAD, <HI>the Wi&s;e&s;t of the Wi&s;e; mo&s;t excellent among tho&s;e that ex|cel; Great Sacrificer to God and his Prophet</HI> Mahomet; <HI>Interpreter of impenetrable Oracles; and Prie&s;t of the heavenly Law.</HI></P>
<P>I bow my Head to the Du&s;t under thy ve|nerable Feet, O thou divine Image of hea|venly Wi&s;dom; be&s;eeching thee to inflame my Soul with an Ardour becoming a true Mu&s;|&s;ul-Man, Inhabiting the Tents of Infidels and Idol-Wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> our immortal Prophet, who from the Beginning cur&s;ed the whole Race of Unbelievers, among whom I dwell; gave them for a Guide <HI>the wor&s;t of all the infer|nal Furies,</HI> I mean a Spirit of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> and <HI>eternal Strife;</HI> and this Offspring of Hell &s;o influences them to this Day, that they not only con&s;tantly encline to Factions and Divi&s;ions among them&s;elves; but it is even as their Food to them to quarrel, and wrangle, to fight and ca&s;t Stones at one another; nay, it is their Political Support, and they main|tain the &s;everal Intere&s;ts among them, and cau&s;e the &s;trength of their States to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Means of continual Strife and Di&s;|order.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, immortal <HI>ESAD,</HI> the innumerable Divi&s;ions which reign here a|mong
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the&s;e De&s;pi&s;ers of our Law, and how they maintain eternal Wars with one ano|ther; a Temper ever au&s;picous to our in|vincible Empire, who&s;e Foundations were laid in the fir&s;t Di&s;&s;entions of the Princes of the <HI>Nazarenes.</HI> Their Divi&s;ions were the fir&s;t En|couragements to mighty OTTOMAN, the Founder of the Empire of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmans.</HI> After him, the invincible <HI>Mahomet,</HI> ju&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>the Great,</HI> who fixt the happy <HI>Port,</HI> and &s;eated the En&s;igns of our Prophet in the Metropolis of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire; next to his undaunted Re&s;olution, and the daring Courage of his Ba&s;&s;a's, which gave an Edge to the weighty Sabres of his Jannizaries, and envigorated the Soldier with an Ardour not to be re&s;i&s;ted; I &s;ay, next to this he made the Divi&s;ions of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire the Foot&s;teps to his Glory, and the Avarice and Strife of the Votaries to the Cro&s;s, open'd the Door to the innumerable Armies of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more delightful, venera|ble and &s;anctified <HI>Muli,</HI> than to read the Hi|&s;tories of the&s;e <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> which they have written innumerable Volumes of, in their &s;e|veral Languages, and keep together in Re|po&s;itories, which they call Libraries. I have taken unweary'd Pains to ma&s;ter their &s;everal Tongues, that I might know the Original of the re&s;pective Countries; but a|bove the re&s;t, their Cu&s;toms and Manners; and by this indu&s;trious Search, I &s;uppo&s;e I
<PB N="7" REF="6">
have made &s;ome Ob&s;ervations which may be u&s;eful to thee, with whom are repo&s;ed, as in a Trea&s;ury, the Foundations of Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Be it known then unto thee, venerable and &s;age, the bright Oracle of Council and Know|ledge; that the&s;e <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> among whom I dwell, are a People ju&s;tly dete&s;table by the faithful Believers, for tho&s;e Vices in Pra|cti&s;e which are unknown to the Followers of our holy Prophet; and they particularly expo&s;e them&s;elves to our ju&s;t Hatred in the following Things; in which thou may&s;t credit me fully that I lye not unto thee.</P>
<P>I &s;wear by thy &s;acred Per&s;on and Office, by the hoary Head of my Father and Grand|father, by the grey Hairs now encrea&s;ing on my Face, that I &s;carce believed there were &s;uch People &s;uffer'd to live on the Face of the Earth as I find the&s;e Chri&s;tians to be. Well has our holy Prophet in the divine Oracles of the &s;acred <HI>Alchoran</HI> commanded us to have no intimate Ties either of Rela|tion or Friend&s;hip with the&s;e People, who he has call'd faithle&s;s, treacherous, perjur'd; and has declar'd to be unqualify'd for the Conver&s;ation of innocent Per&s;ons, who do no Evil, and are therefore expos'd to the Snares of tho&s;e that lie in wait to betray.</P>
<P>Verily, it is no new Thing in the&s;e Coun|tries for Fathers to betray their Children; and for Children again to maltreat, de&s;pi&s;e, and curb their Parents; the&s;e are Crimes
<PB N="8" REF="7">
which our more ju&s;t Laws puni&s;h with Death. The ju&s;t Authority as well as Re|verence of Parents, being kept &s;acred by the In&s;tinct of Affections proceeding from Nature's Oeconomy in Man's Soul, are like|wi&s;e pre&s;erv'd &s;ecure and uninvaded by the <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmans</HI> Law; and the rebelling Son who in&s;ults his Parents, receives his due Reward at the Hand of the Executioner. O much to be reverenc'd and admir'd Ju&s;tice among the faithful Followers of our Great Prophet! How much do many of the&s;e profligate Peo|ple who they call Chri&s;tians deviate from thy Rules, and di&s;honour even that Nature, who&s;e Dictates they know as well as feel in their own Brea&s;ts equally with other Crea|tures!</P>
<P>Here, Variance and Strife reigns in Fami|lies, and Children hold their Parents in open Defiance, to the Scandal of humane Nature. Eternal <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ALLA, in their Language is the Name of <HI>God.</HI></NOTE>ALLA! In &s;aying that tremen|dous Word, I bow'd my Head three Times; and turning my Face towards the Ri&s;ing of the Sun, I wor&s;hipped, laying my Hands upon my Beard; al&s;o repeating the Words three Times with all Reverence and true Devotion, ALLA! ALLA! ALLA! &s;aid I, how does my Soul dete&s;t the&s;e <HI>Naza|renes!</HI> who howbeit they loudly profe&s;s to &s;erve and wor&s;hip him whom they call
<PB N="9" REF="8">
GOD! and that crucify'd Prophet who they exalt equal to the one God that made them and the World; yet hold they his Name in &s;o little Reverence, as to repeat it without any Regard to the Maje&s;ty of his dreadful being, even on the mo&s;t common and trivial Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>So little do they give Homage to the un|utterable Divinity of the Creator, that with an impious Levity they will in the &s;elf-&s;ame Hour wor&s;hip and bla&s;pheme; u&s;ing his tremendous Name this Moment with a &s;eem|ing but hypocritical Devotion; and the next Moment without the lea&s;t Reverence, no not &s;o much as &s;eeming, or in Appearance, can repeat the &s;ame awful Words in Sport and Recreation! Can any Thing be more to be abhorr'd in the World! Ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>by us,</HI> be the immortal <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who has com|manded us to dete&s;t and abhor Men who by &s;uch abominable Practices ju&s;tly call upon us to have them in Dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Nor is this all by far which is hateful to ju&s;t Men in the Manners of the&s;e Peo|ple; for being, <HI>as I &s;hall tell thee further,</HI> on my particular Affairs in one of the I&s;lands of the Northern Ocean, call'd <HI>Brit&mdash;,</HI> after I had &s;pent &s;ome Time to learn the Speech u&s;ed therein, I found the People of that Country, albeit they &s;eem'd more devout and religious than other Nations, and had among them innumerable Temples for their Wor&s;hip, yet were they in one of the vile&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and mo&s;t unnatural Exce&s;&s;es of Crime &s;o far gone beyond the Wickedne&s;s of all the Nations in the World, that I cannot but give thee an Idea of them, as of the wor&s;t of all Chri&s;tians, appealing to thy un-erring Knowledge to di&s;cern if I do Inju&s;tice to the&s;e wretched People, yea or no.</P>
<P>The&s;e People, as I &s;aid, appear religious, and have built innumerable Temples to their God; in the&s;e they wor&s;hip in great &s;eeming Devotion, lifting up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven, and Praying with loud Repeatings and Re&s;pon&s;es to their God to <HI>have Mercy upon them, to hear them;</HI> &s;aying &s;uch Words as the&s;e;<Q>I ALLA Zeidama! Zeidama reis mu&s;a yeida&s;i ALLA!</Q> Which in their Language is &s;ounded thus;<Q><L>O Chri&s;t hear us!</L>
<L>We be&s;eech thee to hear us, good Lord.</L>
<L>Lord have Mercy upon us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And yet if we follow the&s;e Chri&s;tians out of their Mo&s;ques, or Temples of Wor&s;hip, and come to conver&s;e with them in their common Affairs, we &s;hall hear the &s;ame Mouth that before call'd to their God to <HI>have Mercy upon them,</HI> call upon him with horrible Rage and bla&s;phemous Fury to <HI>damn them.</HI> Horrid Infidelity! or un&s;uffe|rable Bla&s;phemy. Is it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Men can believe, that this God they pray to, is able to damn them! No, that cannot be; they are too wi&s;e to call upon him to do it, if they believ'd him to be able. Nor is this any Te&s;timony of the Exce&s;s of their ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions, when they thus imprecate the Wrath of their God; for it is the cur&s;ory Way of their Speech: It might admit Excu&s;e, were it done as in &s;ome fierce Provocations, and in extraordi|nary Motions of the Spirits, which urge the People of other Nations to &s;wear or cur&s;e: But as I &s;aid that the&s;e go beyond all Nations in this Wickedne&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Praying to God to puni&s;h and damn them|&s;elves; &s;o they do it in Sport, in Je&s;t, for their Diver&s;ion, and even for no Occa&s;ion at all; which te&s;tifies that they e&s;teem not their God as the Nature of a Divine Infinite Being directs Men to e&s;teem him, but look on him as a Being that merits to be mock'd and ridicul'd, not wor&s;hipped and ado|red.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t I heard this with my own Ears, <HI>having learn'd the Speech of the Country, as above,</HI> I &s;tood amaz'd; and turning my Face towards the my&s;terious Tomb of our Great Prophet, I ble&s;s'd the Name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> thrice, lifting up my Hands to Heaven; giving Thanks to God <HI>that I was not a Chri|&s;tian!</HI> And above all, that I was not a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tian! After which, looking round me, I &s;tamp'd thrice on the Ground, &s;aying
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;urely the Great ONE GOD that reigns omnipotent <HI>is not in this Place:</HI> What do I here? and vow'd to <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be gone, and not to &s;et the Foot of a believing <HI>Mu&s;&s;ul|man</HI> again upon that unholy Place.</P>
<P>Were it to happen for the good of Mankind, &s;ublime Patron of the true Believers, that thou woulde&s;t be but one Month in this Place, thou woulde&s;t a&s;&s;uredly cau&s;e the ve|ry Name of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to be dete&s;ted among all the true Wor&s;hippers of our immortal <HI>ALLA,</HI> when thou &s;houlde&s;t relate to them, from that Mouth whence flow the everla&s;ting Oracles of Truth, what horrid Impieties, what Con|tempt of all Religion, what Di&s;honour to the very Notion of a God reigning over the Univer&s;e, abounds in the common Practi&s;e of the&s;e People. As we the true <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> wor&s;hip one God, &s;o we pay our Fear and Homage ever to him; tremble and cover our Eyes at the Mention of his Name; and are not to be brought by any Exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion or Wine, or any other Intemperance, to &s;peak irreverently of that Power we wor&s;hip: But the&s;e People pray to him one Moment, and bla&s;pheme him the very next Moment in the mo&s;t infamous Manner; and this with an in|fidelity and Contempt of his Omnipotence inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;candalous.</P>
<P>I could not &s;oon deliver my Thoughts from the ju&s;t Abhorrence which this Thing had given me of the Chri&s;tian Name: O <HI>Mabomet!</HI> &s;aid I, belov'd of Heaven, &s;urely
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the&s;e are the People of whom thou ha&s;t &s;aid, <HI>God &s;hall de&s;troy the wickede&s;t of Men from the Face of the Earth!</HI> Why have not thy immortal Cre&s;cents been here di&s;|play'd, and the innumerable Tefta's or Le|gions of thy Servant the invincible Empe|ror whom thou crowne&s;t with Victory, been extended to the&s;e I&s;lands to remove &s;uch a Race of Men from the Face of the Earth!</P>
<P>But as I was mu&s;ing upon the&s;e Things, I determin'd that while I &s;tay'd in this (<HI>to me</HI>) amazing Country, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e I re&s;olv'd never to come &s;o far within the Dominions of <HI>Lucifer</HI> the Prince of Bla&s;|phemies any more; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I determin'd to know as much as I could receive of the Di&s;|po&s;ition and Conduct of the People of this Country, that I might lay it before thee, and that thou maye&s;t cur&s;e them with the Cur&s;es of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and mighte&s;t continue to ble&s;s the unde&s;iled Land, where inhabit the true Children of Virtue.</P>
<P>Upon farther Search into the Wickedne&s;s of the&s;e Lands, I found them to be infa|mous in my Eyes beyond all the Nations of the Earth, on &s;everal other Occa&s;ions; for know, Renowned among the Servants of our Prophet, that as <HI>we believe</HI> the <HI>Nazarenes</HI> are the mo&s;t wicked People upon the Face of the Earth for the dete&s;table Crimes of Fraud, Inju&s;tice, Rapine, Adultery, and Drunken|ne&s;s; &s;o when I am &s;peaking to thee of the Crimes of tho&s;e they call <HI>Brit&mdash;,</HI> whom I
<PB N="14" REF="13">
e&s;teem by far the wickede&s;t of all other Chri&s;tians, I &s;hall not &s;peak in thy &s;acred Ears of the Crimes they commit in com|mon with the re&s;t of the Race of Unbelie|vers, but of tho&s;e inimitable Exce&s;&s;es in which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to run, beyond the re&s;t of Mankind; and in which they make them&s;elves dete&s;table even in the Eyes of other Chri&s;tians, who are not indeed able to match or come near them in Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have given thee one Example; I &s;hall now give thee another, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are a Nation who have &s;o little Dread upon them of the unutterable Name of God, that albeit they have divers good Laws forbid|ding the Sin of Swearing, by the Name of their God, that yet they are the mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to the dete&s;table Crime of Perjury of any Nation which I have convers'd with un|der the Sun; and this more e&s;pecially is cau&s;ed by two Things, which we the true Wor&s;hippers of God, and Believers of the Truth, wi&s;ely and carefully &s;hun and avoid: 1. The want of a due Reverence to the God which they wor&s;hip; of whom, <HI>if they believ'd his Ju&s;tice,</HI> they ought to be &s;o afraid, as that they could by no means &s;wear by his Name in &s;uch trivial Things as they do; or as to give &s;o little Regard to what they have &s;worn after they have atte&s;ted it in his &s;acred Name. I ad|verti&s;e thee here, that by the Swearing here mention'd, I do not mean the common
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Swearing in Di&s;cour&s;e; of which indeed the whole Race of the Chri&s;tians of every Na|tion are mo&s;t horribly guilty, &s;o that even in the Streets nothing is heard more com|mon than that the young Children take the Name of their Fathers God into their Mouths, horribly Swearing, Cur&s;ing, and Prophaning his Name whom at the &s;ame Time they pretend to acknowledge and to wor&s;hip, and this not only without Puni&s;h|ment by the Magi&s;trates, but even without &s;o much as a Reproof from their Fathers.</P>
<P>But this, I &s;ay, is a Sin in common with other of the Nations of the Unbelievers; and therefore I am not now upon that, but upon their Swearing in Deci&s;ion of contro|verted Things between one and another by the Authority of their Laws, in which Ca&s;e this Nation, above all the Chri&s;tian Tribes, are execrably guilty; for as much as they make &s;light of that Thing call'd an Oath, invoking the Name of their God to the meane&s;t Trifles, familiarizing the very ta|king an Oath, by the Frequency of it; &s;o that the often calling their God to Witne&s;s in their little private Ca&s;es, is made to de|preciate not only the Solemnity of the Oath it &s;elf, but even to de&s;troy that Awe which all Nations ought to entertain of the Deity which they wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> this is not all; for if I am not mi&s;inform'd of the Nature of the &s;ame of the Oaths, which the&s;e horrid Men call'd
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HI>Nazarenes</HI> are oblig'd by their Laws to take, nay, which they are often obliged to repeat; they are of &s;uch a Nature, as that it is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible but that they &s;hould be bro|ken; and yet the Wretches tremble not when they take them: And to confirm the Truth of this to thee, for the Offence is of &s;uch a Nature, that thou maye&s;t even &s;u&s;|pect that by living &s;o long among Infidels and Chri&s;tians, I &s;hould have learned to lye as they do: I &s;ay, to confirm this to thee, I here &s;ignify to thee, that while I lived in that Country call'd <HI>Brit&mdash;,</HI> a Book, or Writing, was publi&s;hed among them, written by one who&s;e Heart was touch'd with the Infamy of &s;uch a Practi&s;e; in which the Author, who was a Man &s;kill'd in their Law, and of the Degree whom they call there <HI>Sergeants at Law,</HI> undertook to charge the Schools of their Prie&s;ts, which are kept at two Cities remote from their Capital Ci|ty, I &s;ay undertook to charge them with this mo&s;t dete&s;table Crime of Perjury, and that not from a meer ca&s;ual Neglect, or Breach of their Law, but even by the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of their Foundation, and the Laws of their &s;aid Schools, which, as he made plain to the World, impo&s;ed &s;uch Oaths at the En|trance of the Scholars into their &s;aid Schools, and afterwards at their taking Degrees on their farther Advancement in the Knowledge of Letters, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to keep; and as it was by the Practice of the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
&s;everal Schools ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to break, &s;o that, in a Word, mo&s;t venerable <HI>Muli,</HI> the Youth of the&s;e Schools, if this Lawyer &s;ays true, are brought up to this mi&s;erable Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Provoking the Divine Ju&s;tice to bla&s;t and de&s;troy them; and yet the&s;e are the Race of their Prie&s;ts, and the In&s;tructors of their People! What then mu&s;t be the Peo|ple who they in&s;truct? This thou wilt ea&s;i|ly conclude mu&s;t be according to that wick|ed Example; for our Prophet has told us, that evil Laws cannot produce good Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The&s;e, venerable Father of Wi&s;dom, are &s;ome of the Crimes practi&s;ed in that Part of the Country of the <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> which I have related; and for which I doubt not thou wilt declare them infamous in thy heavenly <HI>Zun&egrave;,</HI> or Book of Principles, which I know thou art Compiling for the In&s;truction of the Faithful.</P>
<P>But neither are the&s;e the Sum of their ju&s;t Characters, for innumerable Follies at|tend them in the re&s;t of their Conduct; which no doubt thou wilt a&s;cribe to Heaven's ju&s;t Vengeance on a Nation of Unbelievers, for Sins again&s;t the Knowledge they have had given to them; for over and above the horrible Sins of For&s;wearing as above, and calling upon their Gods to damn them: They have one Thing which is their pecu|liar, and which I think is their Puni&s;hment for other Crimes, rather than that it is in it
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;elf a Crime; and this that they are the mo&s;t wrangling, contentious, &s;elf-divided People in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>It would offend thy Ears, thou who art the Patron of Peace, if I &s;hould enter into the tedious Recital of their eternaI Feuds; as well about the Affairs of State, as of Re|ligion, the Hi&s;tory would require a Volume of ten times the Extent of the holy <HI>Alcho|ran,</HI> and take up the Life of a younger Man than I am to write the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It happen'd to be when I was there, a Time of more than ordinary Turns and Changes in their State; and tho'I re&s;ided there but few Years, I &s;aw no le&s;s than four Faces on the Courts, and Divans of their Princes.</P>
<P>It was my Lot to be fir&s;t there in the Reign of their Queen, who&s;e Amba&s;&s;ador at the thrice happy <HI>Port</HI> ki&s;s'd the Robe of our mighty Emperor, and who&s;e Name was <HI>Anna;</HI> a Prince&s;s not able, by rea&s;on of her Sex, to influence the Turbulence of her Courtiers: But why do I &s;ay as a Woman, if I may believe the Relation they give of them|&s;elves; no Ma&s;culine Monarch they have had, has been able by the Authotity either of his Wi&s;dom, or of his Office, to guide the ambi|tious De&s;igns of his Courtiers in that Coun|try; but as they are ever hunting after Pro|fits and Preferments, &s;o they are ever form|ing Factions and Parties again&s;t one another, which they &s;upport vigorou&s;ly, by drawing

<P>If it was thus during the Reign of the po|litick Kings who went before, it may with much more Rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o in the late Queen's Reign; who being in her &s;elf of a peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition, would very fain have contented all Sides; and was oblig'd to leave her Admini&s;tration in the Hands of tho&s;e People who &s;he employ'd, who con|tending &s;o furiou&s;ly one with another, as not to be appea&s;ed, much le&s;s hinder'd by her Authority, &s;he &s;eem'd to be little more than a Name among them; the Parties guiding her as this or that Side appear'd more nume|rous, to act now this way, now that, even in Contradiction, under the Influence of one Side to the Maxims of the other: Nor was it &s;o in her Reign only, but even in the

Reign of the King her immediate Predece&s;|for; and it begins very much to be &s;o even in the Reign of the Succe&s;&s;or; nor does his bearing the Character of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t mighty Prince among the <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> or Chri&s;tians, alter the Ca&s;e; the Influence of Parties being &s;till &s;o great, that even that Wi&s;dom for which this Prince is &s;o famous, directs him to act very much by the Agency of the Parties, as he thinks fit to let this or that Faction have the leading Influence in his Affairs; only with this Difference, that he does not &s;uffer this blindly, and unin|form'd, as has at other Times been the Ca&s;e; But rather nece&s;&s;arily to &s;upport his own Intere&s;ts, which might otherwi&s;e be in Hazard to publick Di&s;affections, if he did not permit one Party to flatter them&s;elves with the Notions of being in his Favour, that they might ballance the In&s;olence of tho&s;e who really were the Object of his Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whatever is the Ca&s;e, mo&s;t true it is, that the Court in this divided part of the World, is continually form'd into, and led by Parties and Factions of Politicians; who are heaving and thru&s;ting at one another with that Vio|lence, as that it is hard to &s;ay there is at any Time a calm Interval, in which they are not in-the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion on this Account.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Di&s;orders, it is no le&s;s &s;trange to &s;ee how both Sides con&s;tantly claim to them|&s;elves the Title of Patriots, and tell the World

they are acting for the publick Good; and yet if any one however violent in that Side, and which (at that Time) is in Favour, hap|pens to be turn'd out, he never fails to go over to the other Extreme, as likewi&s;e the other if taken in, fails not to joyn with the Party in Place, &s;till continuing to pretend to an un|alterable Zeal for the <HI>Publick Good.</HI> By this Means, it is not to be expre&s;s'd how natural it is to the&s;e Men to change their Party and Principles, and to call Evil good, and Good evil, ju&s;t as their Intere&s;t guides: For be it known to thee, immortal Father of &s;age Councils, there was &s;carce a great Cour|tier in that Country, or a Chief Mini&s;ter in the Admini&s;tration of their Affairs, who has not thought it convenient to his Intere&s;t to be on every Side, now on this Side, now on that, then again on this, turning as oft even as the Advancement of his Avarice or Ambition guided.</P>
<P>Even at this Juncture, that Court is agita|ted or di&s;turb'd with the Di&s;contents of &s;ome of tho&s;e Men, who at the Acceffion of the Prince now Reigning, were the mo&s;t zealous for his Intee&s;t, and the warme&s;t in the Pro|&s;ecuting and pu&s;hing on the Re&s;entments of the Publick again&s;t tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him; and yet no &s;ooner did this Prince find him|&s;elf obliged to di&s;mi&s;s &s;ome of the&s;e from their Employments in his Court, but they immediately &s;hook Hands, and contracted Friend&s;hip with tho&s;e who they had treated

<P>How much more advantageous to the pub|lick Peace, and agreeable to the Nature of Government, is the Divine Authority of the Grand Seignior, our glorious Emperor! who when he finds it for the Good of his Go|vernment to di&s;place from the great Em|ploys of State, or remove from the Coun|cils of his Imperial Divan, his Grand Viziers, or other Officers of State; gives them their Quietus by the more ea&s;y and indi&s;puted Authority of the Bow-&s;tring; removing there|by all the Caballing and Intrieguing of Par|ties, in Order to re-place Favourites, and effectually prevent Faction and Di&s;order. Had the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Princes exercis'd this Au|thority with their di&s;plac'd Courtiers, who perhaps as well de&s;erv'd that Treatment as any of our more faithful Ba&s;&s;a's, the Spirit of Strife and Faction had long &s;ince been ba|ni&s;hed from that Court: But it &s;eems they have certain Laws and Con&s;titutions among them&s;elves, which abridge their Princes of &s;o whole&s;ome an Authority; and this per|haps may be a Rea&s;on why the Courtiers take &s;uch Freedoms, which in our happy <HI>Port</HI> is never heard of; which Laws as they are one Way the Safety of the Mini&s;ters, &s;o they are the other Way the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e In&s;ults upon their Princes, and tho&s;e Factions

<P>But to pa&s;s from the&s;e Things; I mu&s;t in|form thee, that the&s;e are the lea&s;t of the&s;e publick Confu&s;ions in this Country: Sure the Gods of the&s;e Chri&s;tians are going to ca&s;t them off; and are re&s;olv'd to bring them to De&s;truction by the Agency of their own Follies: Seeing they &s;uffer them to fall into &s;uch Breaches and &s;uch continual Quarrels as are not con&s;i&s;tent with their being as a Nation; and which expo&s;es them to the Scorn and Contempt even of all their Fel|low-Creatures.

<P>Did the&s;e <HI>Nazarenes</HI> but know how ju&s;t|ly we laugh at their unaccountable and mo&s;t ridiculons Contentions; and how it confirms the Followers of our Great Prophet in their mo&s;t ju&s;t Abhorrence of that Religion which is not able to pre&s;erve the Peace and Har|mony of its Profe&s;&s;ors, &s;urely they would be wi&s;er.</P>

<P>But to return to the Ca&s;e in hand; it will be needful for thee to be faithfully in|form'd of the infernal Spirit of <HI>Contention</HI> which rages among the&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that thou maye&s;t thereby make tho&s;e <HI>Nazarenes</HI> who come among us at the illu&s;trious <HI>Port,</HI> a&s;ham'd of their <HI>Country,</HI> and of their <HI>Religi|on,</HI> and maye&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully exhort them to believe in the pure Doctrines of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and to embrace the Faith of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen,</HI> which teaches Ju&s;tice and Peace, Love and Virtue, and implacably hates and dete&s;ts tho&s;e pretended Religions, which permits &s;uch Fountains of <HI>Strife</HI> and <HI>Contention</HI> to flow among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Reli|gious.</P>
<P>Certainly the Paths which lead to Paradi&s;e, mu&s;t partake of that Haven of Peace: Strife, Rage, Contention, and Hatred, burning in the Brea&s;t of Men, is a Fire kindled from the eternal Lake where evil Spirits inhabit, and therefore partakes of the Nature of that Place. In vain therefore do the&s;e Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts &s;trive to per&s;wade Men that they are the Servants of the High God, with whom dwelleth Peace, while they are arm'd with Rage, Envy, Contention, and unnatural Ma|lice

again&s;t each other, Waging War with one another, even to the Murthering the good Name of their Neighbour by all po&s;&s;ible Slan|der, which is wor&s;e than killing his Body.</P>
<P>And that thou may&s;t not think I do In|ju&s;tice even to the&s;e Infidels, I &s;hall give thee, Illu&s;trious Guide of Verity, a brief Account of the War kindled among tho&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h Dervi&s;es,</HI> of whom I &s;pake.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t thou may&s;t under&s;tand, that there hath been a Divi&s;ion fir&s;t among them not meerly religious, but rather political; &s;ome of the <HI>Churchmen</HI> choo&s;ing rather to &s;uffer the Lo&s;s of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Livings, than to take Oaths of Fidelity and Recogni|tion to the pre&s;ent King, whom they e&s;teem an U&s;urper; Tthe&s;e, to maintain their Separation, renounce certain Doctrines for|merly held among them; <HI>to wit,</HI> of the King being &s;upreme Head of the Church; from whence they infer, that the pre&s;ent Govern|ment of the <HI>Church</HI> is Schi&s;matical, that they are not lawfully depos'd and turn'd out of their Benefices, but that the Civil Power has u&s;urped upon the <HI>Church,</HI> which they had nothing to do with; and that the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Promotion is &s;till theirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Civil Government</HI> an&s;wers this with Coertion, as indeed &s;uch trifling de&s;erv'd; and being &s;upported by the great Divan, which they call their Parliament, they regard not the Obje|ctions of the Prie&s;ts. And this is a divi&s;ion which
<PB N="26" REF="25">
in its &s;elf has much embarra&s;s'd the Nation.</P>
<P>But there is a new War &s;ince broken out among the Prie&s;ts which are on the &s;ide of the Government, and are Oppo&s;ers of tho&s;e they call here the <HI>Depriv'd Clergy.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;&s;uredly I do not mi&s;call it, when I &s;ay it is a War, altho' it be not carry'd on with Sabre or Gun, or any other carnal In&s;tru|ment of Offence: A War of the Tongue in the&s;e Countries is oftentimes more fatal than that of the Sword; and tho' the&s;e Men rather &s;cold than fight, yet, to u&s;e their own Words, they ca&s;t <HI>Firebrands, Arrows,</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> They ca&s;t <HI>Firebrand Words</HI> enflam'd from Hell; Words of Bitterne&s;s, to provoke and enrage the Per&s;ons they are bent again&s;t, and rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions to a Flame: Their Words are <HI>Arrows</HI> dipt in Poi&s;on, and are &s;ure to give mortal Wounds to the Reputa|tion of the Per&s;ons they are ca&s;t at; and <HI>Death,</HI> becau&s;e to kill the Fame of our Neighbour is, according to the Rules of our exalted Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> a wilful and mo&s;t cruel Murther.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Circum&s;tances attend the Ca&s;e which, as I have hinted, happen'd in this Place. The Hi&s;tory take briefly thus: <HI>There was a certain</HI> Rabbi, <HI>or</HI> Prie&s;t <HI>of the Chri&s;tians who had been lately exalted by the Favour of the Prince to the Degree of a</HI> Muf|ti <HI>or</HI> Patriarch, <HI>or as they call him here a</HI> Bi&s;hop, <HI>of one of their Provinces: This Per|&s;on being for Reputation eminent, and in Learn|ing</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<HI>and popular E&s;teem very advantageou&s;ly repre&s;ented to the Government, was called to make an Harangue or Oration before their King; he di&s;charg'd the Work very much to the Satisfaction of the Prince, and of all the A&s;&s;embly; &s;o that he receiv'd the King's Com|mand to make the &s;ame publick by Print.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But he had no &s;ooner done &s;o, than &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts of the &s;ame Temple envying him the Glory which his Preaching, &s;o they call it here, had brought to him, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, rai&s;ed a terrible Commotion again&s;t certain Doctrines and Po&s;itions which he bad there laid down, and a&s;&s;erted; objecting that they were not &s;uitable to the Rules laid down in their Law or</HI> Alchoran, <HI>a Book which they univer|&s;ally believ'd to be the Rule of their Faith, concerning tho&s;e Doctrines, and which they call the</HI> BIBLE.</P>
<P><HI>The Oppo&s;ition made to this Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o great, that much Strife and Lo&s;s of Charity was found between them; many oppo&s;ing this</HI> Mufti, <HI>and that with &s;uch Warmth, as to u&s;e him very &s;curvily upon this Occa&s;ion; nay, at length the Great Divan, or A&s;&s;embly of the Prie&s;ts in that Temple took him to Task, re|&s;olving to cen&s;ure both this</HI> Mufti <HI>and his Book, &s;uppo&s;ing his Principles to be fal&s;e, and Doctrines un&s;ound.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This was carry'don with &s;uch Warmth, that it was feared the</HI> Mufti <HI>would have been run down by that A&s;&s;embly, when on a &s;udden the King, by who&s;e Licence they act here in &s;uch</HI>

<P><HI>The Truth is, that A&s;&s;embly which they call here in their Language the</HI> Convocation, <HI>has not been eminent, as I could learn, for any con|&s;iderable Actions of late Years, which is princi|pally by &s;ome learned Men laid to the Door of the&s;e Cau&s;es.</HI></P>

<HI>But as if by the Nature of the Thing, the &s;aid Prie&s;ts were fated to make them|&s;elves contemptible among the People, and in|deed infamous to all the World, another Inci|dent occurr'd, which brought the Quarrel to be more ab&s;tractly a meer Quarrel of the Prie&s;ts, and the State Differences or Parties to have no Concern in it; and as the Occa&s;i|on of this, as well as the Manner of carrying it on, was mo&s;t particularly &s;candalous to the Name of Chri&s;tians in general as &s;uch, &s;o it mu&s;t be the more agreeable to thee to have a full Account of the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t Quarrel, as I have told thee, being check'd by the Kingly Power, was taken up by the Prie&s;ts, and carry'd on in Defence of what their A&s;&s;embly or Convocation had be|gun, and &s;ome Writings pa&s;s'd on both Sides full of Invectives and foul Language, &s;uch as they frequently give to one another in this Country in &s;uch Ca&s;es, reproaching one another with Ignorance, In&s;incerity, and Equivocation, in a mo&s;t &s;candalous manner; in&s;omuch that &s;ome of their own People who were wi&s;er than the re&s;t, began to admoni&s;h them on both Sides to con&s;ider how they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the Laughter and Ridicule of their Enemies; as indeed was mo&s;t ju&s;t, for as there is &s;everal Divi&s;ions and Schi&s;ms in this wretched Country in their Religion, &s;ome wor&s;hipping after one way, and &s;ome after another; &s;ome entertain|ing Notions of their God after this way, and &s;ome after that; with infinite Animo&s;ity and</HI>

<P>This gave &s;ome Cau&s;e of Triumph to the Party and Friends of the <HI>Doctor,</HI> and made them &s;ecretly rejoyce, that it fell among their Enemies, not caring how much they were expos'd. Nor did the fir&s;t <HI>Mufti</HI> abate them an Inch for their being of his own Party; but pretending the Calumny &s;hould lie where it ought to lie, he pro|ceeded by daily publick Notices in Print, to pu&s;h at the Di&s;covery of the Fraud, as he call'd it; and the <HI>Doctor</HI> having nam'd the Per&s;on, and fix'd it upon that Per&s;on beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of Denial, &s;tood ef|fectually clear.</P>
<P>This Per&s;on being a Man of equal Dig|nity in the <HI>Church</HI> with the fir&s;t, all the Eyes of the Nation were turn'd upon him: The fir&s;t <HI>Mufti</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> &s;par'd him not; neither his Equality of Office, his Seni|ority of Age, or his being of the &s;ame <HI>Poli|tick Party,</HI> weigh'd with him. He chal|leng'd
<PB N="35" REF="34">
him in the &s;ame earne&s;t Manner as he had done the <HI>Doctor</HI> before.</P>
<P>It would have pleas'd you, illu&s;trious Fa|ther of the true Believers, to have &s;een what wretched work the&s;e Men made of this new Conte&s;t: The new Defendant ac|quited him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly ill; he prevaricated; contradicted him&s;elf; &s;huf|fled; equivocated; in a Word, he left no Stone unturn'd to di&s;engage him&s;elf from the Noo&s;e in which he was taken, but &s;till had the Misfortune to make his Ca&s;e wor&s;e, by every Step he took to make it better.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He would have doubled with the <HI>Doctor,</HI> and deny'd part of the Words; al|ledging, That he had &s;aid, the Additions to the Sermon were made, not before it was preached, but before it was publi&s;hed: But the <HI>Doctor</HI> affirm'd po&s;itively, That it was otherwi&s;e; and brought &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces to prove it, as put an End to that Di&s;|pute. Then the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> nam'd another <HI>Do|ctor</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Church;</HI> but he deny'd it under his Hand, and expos'd the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> as a doting old Man, who had heard &s;ome|body &s;ay the Words, but did not know who; and had nam'd him to them, having told the Story &s;o often, 'till he believ'd it to be true. The Battle now was transferr'd
<PB N="36" REF="35">
from the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> to the <HI>Bi&s;h|op</HI> and this other <HI>Doctor,</HI> who is called a <HI>Dean;</HI> and here began a Conte&s;t &s;o &s;canda|lous, as, ble&s;&s;ed be our Great Prophet, was never heard of, among the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Faith of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> nothing but the <HI>Na|zarenes</HI> could ever be guilty of &s;uch a &s;canda|lous Contention.</P>
<P>Were it not, that nothing can be &s;o vile, but we may find Examples of it among the Pretenders to Religion in the&s;e Parts of the World, it would be Matter of A&s;to|ni&s;hment to &s;ee two Men dre&s;s'd up in Robes of Religion, dignify'd with Titles among the Teachers of the People, and e&s;teem'd as <HI>Reverend Fathers</HI> in their <HI>Church;</HI> oppo|&s;ing each other with an equally Ob&s;tinacy, and Fury; affirming, with the greate&s;t Impre|cations, two Contraries, one of which only can be true: The one Pledging his <HI>Eternal Sal|vation</HI> on the Truth of his Part; the other Imprecating his God to help him here, and judge him hereafter according to the Truth of his Part; and yet one of the&s;e, we all know, mu&s;t &s;peak fal&s;ly.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> King of the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> what wicked People are the&s;e <HI>Nazarenes!</HI> Doubtle&s;s their Great Prophet JESUS, who we believe to have been an holy Per&s;on, will not approve of this their
<PB N="37" REF="36">
Behaviour, and if he is to judge them at la&s;t, as they affirm to believe, he will cer|tainly condemn them to &s;ome terrible Pu|ni&s;hment for &s;uch abominable Things as the&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, had not Heaven de|ny'd the People of the&s;e Nations the Know|ledge of the ju&s;t Oracles of our Law, or were they in the Neighbourhood of righteous People, who are honour'd with the Truth; when they behold the up|right Dealings of the faithful <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen,</HI> the Abhorrence we entertain of all &s;uch wicked doings as the&s;e; they would, no doubt, embrace the Ways of Light and Truth.</P>
<P>For it is mo&s;t evident, that the common Peo|ple of the&s;e Lands do &s;incerely dete&s;t the faith|le&s;s Dealings of the&s;e Men; and it brings them into the utmo&s;t Contempt with tho&s;e who are to be guided to Happine&s;s by their Di|rection. How much more mu&s;t it &s;erve to make the Name of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> odious to us, who are guided by Principles and Rules which teach us to do Ju&s;tice, and to &s;peak Truth with our Lips.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e Men had much better embrace the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which guides to immor|tal Plea&s;ures, and leads us by the Path of Vir|tue and Ju&s;tice; &s;eeing no &s;uch Strife, no
<PB N="38" REF="37">
&s;uch Contention, no &s;uch Feuds, and, above all, no &s;uch abominable Prevarications, are to be found among us the righteous <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen,</HI> Believers in God, and Followers of his Great Prophet.</P>
<P>I wonder the Imperial <HI>Port</HI> of our invin|cible Emperor, crown'd with the Moon, and &s;hin'd on with the radiant Light of Heaven, &s;uffers the&s;e In&s;idels to traffick in and re&s;ide there; and to carry on their Negocia|tions, without demanding the like Liberty for the Followers of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> who, were they planted here, would by their ju&s;t and righteous Dealings, in Contradiction to the inimitable Fraud and Knavery, their per|fect Uniformity of Religion, and Unity in Affection, in Contradiction to the continual Fraud, Di&s;&s;ention, and Divi&s;ion here prac|tis'd, &s;oon &s;hame the&s;e <HI>Nazarenes</HI> out of their Religion, and bring Thou&s;ands to ac|knowledge, that &s;o far as the Word <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is pretended to &s;ignify a Man of Hone&s;ty and Religion, the <HI>Turks</HI> are better <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> than many of the&s;e.</P>
