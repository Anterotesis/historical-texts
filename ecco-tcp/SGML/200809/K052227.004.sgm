<P>VERSE 5. ONE might fancy at the fir&s;t reading of this Pa&s;&s;age, that <HI>Homer</HI> here turn'd a&s;ide from the main View of his Poem in a vain O&s;tentation of Learning, to amu&s;e him&s;elf with a foreign and unnece&s;&s;ary De|&s;cription of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the&s;e Nations. But we &s;hall find, upon better Con&s;ideration, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s turning a&s;ide his Eyes was nece&s;&s;ary to the Conduct of the Work, as it gives Opportunity to <HI>Neptune</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and thereby cau&s;es all the Adventures of this Book. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> is too refining on this occa&s;ion; when &s;he would have it, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s <HI>averting his Eyes</HI> &s;ignifies his abandon|ing the <HI>Trojans;</HI> in the &s;ame manner, as the Scripture repre|&s;ents the Almighty <HI>turning his Face</HI> from tho&s;e whom he de|&s;erts. But at this rate <HI>Jupiter</HI> turning his Eyes from the Battel, mu&s;t de&s;ert both the <HI>Trojans</HI> and the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and it is evident from the Context, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> intended nothing le&s;s than to let the <HI>Trojans</HI> &s;uffer.</P>

One may ob&s;erve &s;ome Strokes of Lordline&s;s and State in his Character: That Re&s;pect <HI>Agamemnon</HI> &s;eems careful to treat him with, and the particular Di&s;tinctions &s;hewn him at Table, are mention'd in a manner that in&s;inu|ates they were Points upon which this Prince not a little in|&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Il.</HI> 4. &vers;. 257, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The vaunting of his Family in this Book, together with his Sarca&s;ms and contemptuous Railleries on his dead Enemies, &s;avour of the &s;ame Turn of Mind.

<P>I mu&s;t, upon this occa&s;ion, make an Ob&s;ervation once for all, which will be applicable to many Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> and afford a Solution of many Difficulties. It is that our Author drew &s;everal of his Characters with an Eye to the Hi&s;tories then known of famous Per&s;ons, or the Traditions that pa&s;t in tho&s;e Times. One cannot believe otherwi&s;e of a Poet, who appears &s;o nicely exact in ob&s;erving all the Cu&s;toms of the Age he de&s;cribed; nor can we imagine the infinite Num|ber of minute Circum&s;tances relating to particular Per&s;ons, which we meet with every where in his Poem, could po&s;&s;ibly have been invented purely as Ornaments to it. This Refle|ction will account for a hundred &s;eeming Oddne&s;&s;es not only in the <HI>Characters,</HI> but in the <HI>Speeches</HI> of the Iliad: For as no Author is more true than <HI>Homer</HI> to the Character of the Per&s;on he introduces &s;peaking, &s;o no one more often &s;uits his
<PB N="67" REF="66">
Oratory to the Character of the Per&s;on &s;poken to. Many of the&s;e Beauties mu&s;t needs be lo&s;t to us, yet this Suppo&s;ition will give a new Light to &s;everal Particulars. For in&s;tance, the Speech I have been mentioning of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to <HI>Ido|meneus</HI> in the 4<HI>th</HI> Book, wherein he puts this Hero in mind of the magnificent Entertainments he had given him, be|comes in this View much le&s;s odd and &s;urprizing.

<P>VERSE 451.] It will be nece&s;&s;ary, for the better under|&s;tanding the Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in every Battel he de&s;cribes, to reflect on the particular kind of Fight, and the Circum|&s;tances that di&s;tingui&s;h each. In this View therefore we ought to remember thro' this whole Book, that the Battel de&s;crib'd in it, is a fix'd clo&s;e Fight, wherein the Armies engage in a gro&s;s compact Body, without any of tho&s;e Skirmi&s;hes or Feats of Activity &s;o often mention'd in the foregoing Engagements.

For this Piece of Rail|lery is &s;o far from rai&s;ing Laughter, that it becomes a Hero, and is capable to enflame the Courage of all who hear it. It al&s;o elevates the Character of <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> who notwith&s;tand|ing he is in the mid&s;t of imminent Dangers, pre&s;erves his u&s;ual Gaiety of Temper, which is the greate&s;t Evidence of an uncommon Courage. <HI>Id. p.</HI> 935.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am of an Opinion very different from this of <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> which is al&s;o adopted by M. <HI>Dacier.</HI> So &s;evere and bloody an Irony to a dying Per&s;on is a fault in Morals, if not in Poetry it&s;elf. It &s;hould not have place at all, or if it &s;hould, is ill placed here. <HI>Idomeneus</HI> is repre&s;ented a brave Man, nay a Man of a compa&s;&s;ionate Nature, in the Circum|&s;tance he was introduc'd in, of a&s;&s;i&s;ting a wounded Soldier. What Provocation could &s;uch an one have, to in&s;ult &s;o bar|barou&s;ly an unfortunate Prince, being neither his Rival nor particular Enemy? True Courage is in&s;eparable from Huma|nity, and all generous Warriors regret the very Victories they gain, when they reflect what a Price of Blood they co&s;t. I know it may be an&s;wer'd, that the&s;e were not the Manners of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time, a Spirit of Violence and Deva&s;tation then reigned, even among the cho&s;en People of God, as may be &s;een from the Actions of <HI>Jo&s;hua, &amp;c.</HI> However, if one would forgive the <HI>Cruelty,</HI> one cannot forgive the <HI>Gaiety</HI> on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.

<PB N="75" REF="74">
to introduce them. Would it not rai&s;e a Su&s;picion, that (whatever we &s;ee of his &s;uperior Genius in other re&s;pects) his own Views of Morality were not elevated above the Barbarity of his Age? I think indeed the thing by far the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing in this Author, is that Spirit of Cruelty which appears too manife&s;tly in the Iliad.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> was too judicious to imitate <HI>Homer</HI> in the&s;e Licences, and is much more re&s;erv'd in his Sarca&s;ms and In&s;ults. There are not above four or five in the whole <HI>Aeneid.</HI> That of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> to <HI>Priam</HI> in the &s;econd Book, tho' barbarous in it&s;elf, may be accounted for as intended to rai&s;e a Character of Horror, and render the Action of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> odious; whereas <HI>Homer</HI> &s;tains his mo&s;t Favourite Characters with the&s;e Barbarities. That of <HI>A&s;canius</HI> over <HI>Numanus</HI> in the ninth, was a fair Opportu|nity where <HI>Virgil</HI> might have indulg'd the Humour of a cruel Raillery, and have been excus'd by the Youth and Gaiety of the Speaker; yet it is no more than a very moderate An&s;wer to the In&s;olences with which he had ju&s;t been provok'd by his Enemy, only retorting two of his own Words upon him.

The Beauty however of &s;ome of the&s;e will be lo&s;t to many, who cannot perceive the Re&s;emblance, having never had Op|portunity to ob&s;erve the things them&s;elves. The Life of this De&s;cription will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e who have been at Sea in a Calm: In this Condition the Water is not entire|ly motionle&s;s, but &s;wells gently in &s;mooth Waves, which flu|ctuate backwards and forwards in a kind of balancing Mo|tion: This State continues till a ri&s;ing Wind gives a Deter|mination to the Waves, and rolls 'em one certain way. There is &s;carce any thing in the whole Compa&s;s of Nature that can more exactly repre&s;ent the State of an irre&s;olute Mind, wa|vering between two different De&s;igns, &s;ometimes inclining to the one, &s;ometimes to the other, and then moving to the Point to which its Re&s;olution is at la&s;t determin'd. Every Circum&s;tance of this Compari&s;on is both beautiful and ju&s;t; and it is the more to be admir'd, becau&s;e it is very difficult to find &s;en&s;ible Images proper to repre&s;ent the Motions of the Mind; wherefore we but rarely meet with &s;uch Compari&s;ons even in the be&s;t Poets.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 39. <HI>Their Ships at di&s;tance,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q><HI>Homer</HI> being al|ways careful to di&s;tingui&s;h each Scene of Action, gives a very particular De&s;cription of the Station of the Ships, &s;hewing in what manner they lay drawn up on the Land. This he had only hinted at before; but here taking occa&s;ion on the wounded Heroes coming from their Ships, which were at a
<PB N="130" REF="125">
di&s;tance from the Fight (while others were engag'd in the Defence of tho&s;e Ships where the Wall was broke down) he tells us, that the Shore of the Bay (comprehended between the <HI>Rhaetean</HI> and <HI>Sigaean</HI> Promontories) was not &s;ufficient to contain the Ships in one Line; which they were therefore obliged to draw up in Ranks, ranged in parallel Lines along the Shore. How many of the&s;e Lines there were, the Poet does not determine. M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> without giving any rea&s;on for her Opinion, &s;ays they were but two; one advanced near the Wall, the other on the Verge of the Sea. But it is more than probable, that there were &s;everal intermediate Lines; &s;ince the Order in which the Ve&s;&s;els lay is here de&s;crib'd by a Metaphor taken from the Steps of a <HI>Scaling-Ladder;</HI> which had been no way proper to give an Image only of two Ranks, but very fit to repre&s;ent a greater, tho' undetermin'd Num|ber. That there were more than two Lines, may likewi&s;e be inferr'd from what we find in the beginning of the 11<HI>th</HI> Book; where it is &s;aid, that the Voice of <HI>Di&s;cord,</HI> &s;tanding on the Ship of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es, in the middle of the Fleet,</HI> was heard as far as the Sta|tions of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Ajax, who&s;e Ships were drawn up in the two Extremities:</HI> Tho&s;e of <HI>Ajax</HI> were neare&s;t the Wall (as is expre&s;ly &s;aid in the 68<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;e of the 13<HI>th</HI> Book) and tho&s;e of <HI>Achilles</HI> neare&s;t the Sea, as appears from many Pa&s;&s;ages &s;catter'd thro' the Iliad.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd, that tho&s;e Ships were drawn highe&s;t upon Land, which fir&s;t approached the Shore; the fir&s;t Line therefore con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e who fir&s;t di&s;embark'd, which were the Ships of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;ilaus;</HI> the latter of whom &s;eems mention'd in the Ver&s;e above cited of the 13<HI>th</HI> Book, only to give occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve this, for he was &s;lain as he landed fir&s;t of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And accordingly we &s;hall &s;ee in the 15<HI>th</HI> Book, it is his Ship that is fir&s;t attack'd by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> as it lay the neare&s;t to them.</P>
<P>We may likewi&s;e gue&s;s how it happens, that the Ships of <HI>Achilles</HI> were plac'd neare&s;t to the Sea; for in the An&s;wer of <HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the 9<HI>th</HI> Book, &vers;. 328. he mentions a Naval Expedition he had made while <HI>Agamemnon</HI> lay &s;afe in the Camp: So that his Ships at their Return did natural|ly lie next the Sea; which, without this Con&s;ideration,

<P>VERSE 120.] This Speech of <HI>Diomed</HI> is naturally intro|duced, beginning with an An&s;wer, as if he had been call'd upon to give his Advice.

It can't indeed be deny'd that this hi&s;torical Digre&s;|&s;ion &s;eems more out of Sea&s;on than any of the &s;ame kind which we &s;o frequently meet with in <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ince his Birth and Pa|rentage mu&s;t have been &s;ufficiently known to all at the Siege, as he here tells them.

<PB N="135" REF="130">
the Ancients were fitted to &s;o advantagious a De&s;ign. There was nothing to be &s;een but Fictions, Allegories, and Similitudes, and nothing was to appear as it was in it&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs, upon the whole, as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excu&s;e for it <HI>Homer</HI> might have from ancient Tradition, or what my&s;tical or allegorical Sen&s;e might attone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be a&s;certain'd at this di&s;tant Period of Time. That there had been before his Age a Tradition of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s being laid a&s;leep, appears from the Story of <HI>Hercules</HI> at <HI>Coos,</HI> referr'd to by our Author, &vers;. 285. There is al&s;o a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Diodorus, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 7. which gives &s;ome &s;mall Light to this Fiction. Among other Rea&s;ons which that Hi&s;torian lays down to prove that <HI>Homer</HI> travell'd into <HI>Egypt,</HI> he alledges this Pa&s;&s;age of the Interview of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> which he &s;ays was grounded upon an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Fe&s;tival, <HI>whereon the nuptial Ceremonies of the&s;e two Deities were celebrated, at which time both their Tabernacles, adorned with all &s;orts of Flowers, are carry'd by the Prie&s;ts to the top of a high Moun|tain.</HI> Indeed as the greate&s;t Part of the Ceremonies of the ancient Religions con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome &s;ymbolical Repre&s;entations of certain Actions of their Gods, or rather deify'd Mortals, &s;o a great part of ancient Poetry con&s;i&s;ted in the De&s;cription of the Actions exhibited in the&s;e Ceremonies. The Loves of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Adonis</HI> are a remarkable In&s;tance of this kind, which, tho' under different Names, were celebrated by annual Repre&s;entations, as well in <HI>Egypt</HI> as in &s;everal Nations of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> and to the Images which were carry'd in the&s;e Fe&s;tivals, &s;everal ancient Poets were indebted for their mo&s;t happy De&s;criptions. If the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Diodorus</HI> be admitted, the pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;age will appear with more Dignity, being grounded on Religion; and the Conduct of the Poet will be more ju&s;tifiable, if that, which has been generally accounted an indecent wanton Fiction, &s;hould prove to be the Repre&s;entation of a religious Solemnity. Con|&s;idering the great Ignorance we are in of many ancient &s;u|per&s;titious Ceremonies, there may be probably in <HI>Homer</HI> ma|ny Incidents entirely of this Nature; wherefore we ought to
<PB N="136" REF="131">
be re&s;erv'd in our Cen&s;ures, le&s;t what we decry as wrong in the Poet, &s;hould prove only a Fault in his Religion. And indeed it would be a very unfair way to tax any People, or any Age whatever, with Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s in general, purely from the gro&s;s or ab&s;urd Ideas or Practices that are to be found in their Religions.</P>
<P>In the next Place, if we have recour&s;e to Allegory, (which &s;oftens and reconciles every thing) it may be imagin'd that by the Congre&s;s of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> is meant the min|gling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> (which are generally &s;aid to be &s;ignify'd by the&s;e two Deities.) The Ancients believ'd the <HI>Aether</HI> to be Igneous, and that by its kind Influence up|on the Air it was the Cau&s;e of all Vegetation: To which nothing more exactly corre&s;ponds, than the Fiction of the Earth putting forth her Flowers immediately upon this Con|gre&s;s. <HI>Virgil</HI> has &s;ome Lines in the &s;econd <HI>Georgic,</HI> that &s;eem a perfect Explanation of the Fable into this Sen&s;e. In de&s;cribing the Spring, he hints as if &s;omething of a vivifying Influence was at that time &s;pread from the upper Heavens in|to the Air. He calls <HI>Jupiter</HI> expre&s;ly <HI>Aether,</HI> and repre&s;ents him operating upon his Spou&s;e for the Production of all things.<Q><L>Tum pater omnipotens foecundis imbribus aether</L>

<L>Parturit omnis ager, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But, be all this as it will, it is certain, that whatever may be thought of this Fable in a theological or philo&s;ophical View, it is one of the mo&s;t beautiful Pieces that ever was produc'd by Poetry. Neither does it want its Moral; an ingenious modern Writer (whom I am pleas'd to take any oc|ca&s;ion of quoting) has given it us in the&s;e Words.</P>

As this Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> may to many appear no way artful, and &s;ince it is a principal Article of the Charge brought again&s;t him by &s;ome late <HI>French</HI> Criticks, it will not be improper here to look a little into this Di&s;pute. The Ca&s;e will be be&s;t &s;tated by tran&s;lating the following Pa&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>de la Motte</HI>'s <HI>Reflections &s;ur la Critique.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I could not forbear wi&s;hing that <HI>Homer</HI> had an Art, which he &s;eems to have neglected, that of preparing Events without making them known beforehand, &s;o that when they happen one might be &s;urprized agreeably. I could not be quite &s;atisfied to hear <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the middle of the Iliad, give an exact Abridgment of the Remainder of the Action. Mad. <HI>Dacier</HI> alledges as an Excu&s;e, that this pa&s;t only between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno;</HI> as if the Reader was not let into the Secret, and had not as much &s;hare in the Confidence.</Q></P>
<P>She adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that as we are capable of a great deal of Plea|&s;ure at the Repre&s;entation of a Tragedy which we have &s;een before, &s;o the Surprizes which I require are no way nece&s;&s;ary to our Entertainment. This I think a pure Piece of Sophi&s;try: One may have two &s;orts of Plea&s;ure at the Repre&s;entation of a Tragedy; in the fir&s;t place, that of taking part in an Action of Importance the fir&s;t time it pa&s;&s;es before our Eyes, of being agitated by Fear and Hope for the Per&s;ons one is mo&s;t concern'd about, and in fine, of partaking their Felicity or Misfortune, as they happen to &s;ucceed, or be di&s;appointed.
<P>"This therefore is the fir&s;t Plea&s;ure which the Poet &s;hould de&s;ign to give his Auditors, to tran&s;port them by pathetic
<PB N="209" REF="202">
Surprizes which excite Terror or Pity. The &s;econd Plea|&s;ure mu&s;t proceed from a View of that Art which the Au|thor has &s;hewn in rai&s;ing the former.</P>
<P>"'Tis true, when we have &s;een a Piece already, we have no longer that fir&s;t Plea&s;ure of the Surprize, at lea&s;t not in all its Vivacity; but there &s;till remains the &s;econd, which could never have its turn, had not the Poet labour'd &s;uc|ce&s;sfully to excite the fir&s;t, it being upon that indi&s;pen&s;able Obligation that we judge of his Art.</P>
<P>"The Art therefore con&s;i&s;ts in telling the Hearer only what is nece&s;&s;ary to be told him, and in telling him only as much as is requi&s;ite to the De&s;ign of plea&s;ing him. And altho' we know this already when we read it a &s;econd time, we yet ta&s;te the Plea&s;ure of that Order and Conduct which the Art required.</P>
<P>"From hence it follows, that every Poem ought to be contrived for the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion it is to make. If it be otherwi&s;e, it gives us (in&s;tead of two Plea&s;ures which we expected) two &s;orts of Di&s;gu&s;ts; the one, that of being cool and untouch'd when we &s;hould be mov'd and tran&s;|ported; the other, that of perceiving the Defect which caus'd that Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>"This, in one word, is what I have found in the Iliad. I was not intere&s;ted or touch'd by the Adventures, and I &s;aw it was this cooling Preparation that prevented my being &s;o."</P></Q></P>
<P>It appears clearly that M. <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Defence no way excu&s;es the Poet's Conduct; wherefore I &s;hall add two or three Con|&s;iderations which may chance to &s;et it in a better Light. It mu&s;t be own'd that a Surprize artfully managed, which ari&s;es from unexpected Revolutions of great Actions, affects the Mind with a peculiar Delight: In this con&s;i&s;ts the prin|cipal Plea&s;ure of a Romance and well writ Tragedy. But be|&s;ides this, there is in the Relation of great Events a different kind of Plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from the artful unravelling a Knot of Actions, which we knew before in the gro&s;s. This is a Delight peculiar to Hi&s;tory and Epic Poetry, which is founded on Hi&s;tory. In the&s;e kinds of writing, a preceding &s;ummary Knowledge of the Events de&s;cribed, does no way
<PB N="210" REF="203">
damp our Curio&s;ity, but rather makes it more eager for the Detail. This is evident in a good Hi&s;tory, where ge|nerally the Reader is affected with a greater Delight, in pro|portion to his preceding Knowledge of the Facts de&s;cribed: The Plea&s;ure in this ca&s;e is like that of an Architect fir&s;t viewing &s;ome magnificent Building, who was before well ac|quainted with the Proportions of it. In an Epic Poem the ca&s;e is of a like Nature; where, as if the hi&s;torical Fore-know|ledge were not &s;ufficient, the mo&s;t judicious Poets never fail to excite their Reader's Curio&s;ity by &s;ome &s;mall Sketches of their De&s;ign; which like the Outlines of a fine Picture, will nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e in us a greater de&s;ire to &s;ee it in its fi|ni&s;h'd Colouring.</P>
<P>Had our Author been inclined to follow the Method of managing our Pa&s;&s;ions by Surprizes, he could not well have &s;ucceeded by this manner in the Subject he cho&s;e to write upon, which being a Story of great Importance, the principal Events of which were well known to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to alter the Ground-work of his Piece; and probably he was willing to mark by the&s;e Recapitulations how much of his Story was founded on hi&s;torical Truths, and that what is &s;uperadded were the poetical Ornaments.</P>
<P>There is another Con&s;ideration worth remembring on this Head, to ju&s;tify our Author's Conduct.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WE have at the Entrance of this Book one of the mo&s;t beautiful Parts of the Iliad. The two different Characters are admirably &s;u&s;tain'd in the Dialogue of the two Heroes, wherein there is not a Period but &s;trongly marks not only their na|tural Temper, but that particular Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind in either, which ari&s;es from the pre&s;ent State of Affairs. We &s;ee <HI>Pa|troclus</HI> touch'd with the deepe&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion for the Misfortune of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> (whom the <HI>Trojans</HI> had forc'd to retreat to their Ships, and which Ships were on the Point of burning) pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and pour|ing out his Tears at his Feet. <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;truck with the Grief of his Friend, demands the Cau&s;e of it. <HI>Patroclus,</HI> pointing to the Ships, where the Flames already began to ri&s;e, tells him he is harder than the Rocks or Sea which lay in pro&s;pect before them, if he is not touch'd with &s;o mo|ving a Spectacle, and can &s;ee in cold Blood his Friends pe|ri&s;hing before his Eyes. As nothing can be more natural and affecting than the Speech of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> &s;o nothing is more lively and Picture&s;que than the Attitude he is here de&s;crib'd in.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="274">
The <HI>Pathetic</HI> of <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Speech is finely contra&s;ted by the <HI>Fiert&egrave;</HI> of that of <HI>Achilles.</HI> While the former is melting with Sorrow for his Countrymen, the utmo&s;t he can hope from the latter, is but to borrow his Armour and Troops; to obtain his per&s;onal A&s;&s;i&s;tance he knows is impo&s;&s;ible. At the very In&s;tant that <HI>Achilles</HI> is mov'd to ask the Cau&s;e of his Friend's Concern, he &s;eems to &s;ay that nothing could de&s;erve it but the Death of their Fathers: and in the &s;ame Breath &s;peaks of the total De&s;truction of the <HI>Greeks</HI> as of too &s;light a Cau&s;e for Tears. <HI>Patroclus,</HI> at the opening of this Speech, dares not name <HI>Agamemnon</HI> even for being wounded; and af|ter he has tried to bend him by all the Arguments that could affect an human Brea&s;t, concludes by &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ome Oracle or &s;upernatual In&s;piration is the Cau&s;e that with-holds his Arms. What can match the Fiercene&s;s of his An&s;wer? Which implies, that not the Oracles of Heaven it&s;elf &s;hould be regarded, if they &s;tood in Competition with his Re&s;ent|ment: That if he yields, it mu&s;t be thro' his own mere Mo|tive: The only rea&s;on he has ever to yield, is that Nature it&s;elf cannot &s;upport Anger eternally: And if he yields now, it is only becau&s;e he had before determin'd to do &s;o at a cer|tain time, (<HI>Il.</HI> 9. &vers;. 773.) That time was not till the Flames &s;hould approach to his own Ships, till the la&s;t Article of Dan|ger, and that not of Danger to <HI>Greece,</HI> but to him&s;elf. Thus his very Pity has the &s;terne&s;t Qualifications in the World. After all, what is it he yields to? Only to &s;uffer his Friend to go in his &s;tead, ju&s;t to &s;ave them from pre&s;ent Ruin, but he expre&s;&s;ly forbids him to proceed any farther in their A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, than barely to put out the Fires, and &s;ecure his own and his Friend's Return into their Country: And all this concludes with a Wi&s;h, that (if it were po&s;&s;ible) every <HI>Greek</HI> and every <HI>Trojan</HI> might peri&s;h except them&s;elves. Such is that <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that more than Wrath, as the <HI>Greek</HI><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> implies, which <HI>Homer</HI> has painted in &s;o &s;trong a Co|louring.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 31. <HI>Let</HI> Greece <HI>at length with Pity touch thy Brea&s;t.</HI>]</Q> The Commentators labour to prove, that the Words in the Original, which begin this Speech, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Be not angry,</HI> are not meant to de&s;ire <HI>Achilles</HI> to bear no farther Re&s;entment again&s;t the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but only not to be di&s;pleas'd at the Tears which <HI>Patroclus</HI> &s;heds for their Misfortune. <HI>Patroclus</HI> (they &s;ay) was not &s;o imprudent to begin his Interce&s;&s;ion in that manner, when there was need of &s;omething more in&s;inuating.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>Oracles</HI> were rank'd among the noble&s;t and mo&s;t reli|gious kinds of Divination; the De&s;ign of them being to &s;et|tle &s;uch an immediate way of Conver&s;e with their Gods, as to be able by them not only to explain things intricate and ob&s;cure, but al&s;o to anticipate the Knowledge of future Events; and that with far greater Certainty than they could hope for from Men, who out of Ignorance and Pre|judice mu&s;t &s;ometimes either conceal or betray the Truth. So that this became the only &s;afe way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Con&s;equence, either publick or private. Whether to proclaim War, or conclude a Peace, to in&s;ti|tute a new Form of Government, or enact new Laws, all was to be done with the Advice and Approbation of the Oracle, who&s;e Determinations were always held &s;acred and inviolable. As to the Cau&s;es of Oracles, <HI>Jupiter</HI> was look'd upon as the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of this, and all other &s;orts of Divi|nation; he had the Book of Fate before him, and out of that reveal'd either more or le&s;s, as he pleas'd, to inferior Daemons. But to argue more rationally, this way of Ac|ce&s;s to the Gods has been branded as one of the earlie&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t Pieces of Prie&s;tcraft, that obtain'd in the World. For the Prie&s;ts, who&s;e Dependance was on the Oracles, when they found the Cheat had got &s;ufficient footing, allow'd no Man to con&s;ult the Gods without co&s;t|ly Sacrifices and rich Pre&s;ents to them&s;elves: And as few could bear this Expence, it &s;erv'd to rai&s;e their Credit among the common People, by keeping them at an awful di&s;tance. And to heighten their E&s;teem with the better and wealthier &s;ort, even they were only admitted upon a

few &s;tated Days: By which the thing appear'd &s;till more my&s;terious, and for want of this good Management, mu&s;t quickly have been &s;een through, and fell to the Ground. But whatever juggling there was as to the religious Part, Ora|cles had certainly a good Effect as to the Publick; being admirably &s;uited to the Genius of a People, who would join in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Expedition, and admit of any Change of Government, when they under&s;tood by the O|racle it was the irre&s;i&s;tible Will of the Gods. This was the Method <HI>Minos, Lycurgus,</HI> and all the famous Lawgivers took; and indeed they found the People &s;o entirely devo|ted to this Part of Religion, that it was generally the ea|&s;ie&s;t, and &s;ometimes the only way of winning them into a Compliance. And then they took care to have them deliver'd in &s;uch ambiguous Terms, as to admit of diffe|rent Con&s;tructions according to the Exigency of the Times; &s;o that they were generally interpreted to the Ad|vantage of the State, unle&s;s &s;ometimes there happen'd to be Bribery, or Flattery in the Ca&s;e; as when <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> complain'd that the <HI>Pythia</HI> &s;poke as <HI>Philip</HI> would have her. The mo&s;t numerous, and of greate&s;t Repute were the Oracles of <HI>Apollo,</HI> who in Subordination to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> was appointed to pre&s;ide over, and in&s;pire all &s;orts of Pro|phets and Diviners.

This was the Dawn of Poetry. which &s;oon grew into Repute; and &s;o long as it &s;erv'd to &s;uch noble Purpo&s;es as Religion and Government, Poets were highly honour'd, and admitted into a Share of the Admini&s;tration.

In the Scholia of <HI>Didymus</HI> there is this Remark: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They call'd tho&s;e who &s;erv'd in the Temple, and who explain'd the Ora|cles render'd by the Prie&s;ts, <HI>Hypothets,</HI> or <HI>Under-Prophets.</HI>"</Q> It is certain that there were in the Temples Servitors, or Sub|altern Mini&s;ters, who for the &s;ake of Gain, undertook to ex|plain the Oracles which were ob&s;cure. This Cu&s;tom &s;eems very well e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the <HI>Ion</HI> of <HI>Euripides;</HI> where that young Child (after having &s;aid that the Prie&s;te&s;s is &s;eated on the Tripod, and renders the Oracles which <HI>Apollo</HI> dictates to her) addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to tho&s;e who &s;erve in the Temple, and bids them go and wa&s;h in the <HI>Ca&s;talian</HI> Fountain, to come again into the Temple and explain the Oracles to tho&s;e who &s;hould demand the Explication of them. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore means to &s;hew, that the&s;e <HI>Selli</HI> were, in the Temple of <HI>Dodona,</HI> tho&s;e Subaltern Mini&s;ters that interpreted the Oracles. But this, after all, does not appear to agree with the pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;age: For, be&s;ides that the Cu&s;tom was not e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Homer</HI>'s
<PB N="303" REF="293">
Time, and that there is no Foot&s;tep of it founded in that early Age; the&s;e <HI>Selli</HI> (of whom <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks) are not here Mini&s;ters &s;ubordinate to others, they are plainly the chief Prie&s;ts. The Explication of this word therefore mu&s;t be el&s;e|where &s;ought, and I &s;hall offer my Conjecture, which I ground upon the very Nature of this Oracle of <HI>Dodona,</HI> which was very different from all the other Oracles: In all other Temples the Prie&s;ts deliver'd the Oracle which they had receiv'd from their Gods, immediately: But in the Tem|ple of <HI>Dodona, Jupiter</HI> did not utter his Oracles to his Prie&s;ts, but to his <HI>Selli;</HI> he render'd them to the Oaks, and the wonderful Oaks render'd them to the Prie&s;ts, who declared them to tho&s;e who con&s;ulted them: So the&s;e Prie&s;ts were not properly <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Prophets, &s;ince they did not re|ceive tho&s;e An&s;wers from the Mouth of their God immedi|ately; but they were <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Under-Prophets, becau&s;e they receiv'd them from the Mouth of the Oaks, if I may &s;ay &s;o. The Oaks, properly &s;peaking, were the Prophets, the fir&s;t Interpreters of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Oracles; and the <HI>Selli</HI> were <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Under-Prophets, becau&s;e they pronounc'd what the Oaks had &s;aid.

I am really per&s;uaded that the true Sublime is incapable of that Purity which we find in Compo&s;itions of a lower Strain, and in effect that too much Accuracy &s;inks the Spirit of an Author; whereas the Ca&s;e is generally the &s;ame with the Favourites of Nature, and tho&s;e of Fortune, who with the be&s;t Oeconomy cannot, in the great Abundance they are ble&s;t with, attend to the minuter Articles of their Expence. Writers of a cool Imagination are cautious in their Management, and venture nothing, merely to gain the Character of being correct; but the Sublime is bold and enterprizing, not|with&s;tanding that on every Advance the Danger encrea&s;eth.

And on the&s;e Prin|ciples I will venture to lay it down for a Maxim, that the Sublime (purely on account of its Grandeur) is preferable to all other kinds of Style, however it may fall into &s;ome Inequalities. The Argonauticks of <HI>Apollonius</HI> are faultle&s;s in their kind; and <HI>Theocritus</HI> hath &s;hewn the happie&s;t Vein imaginable for Pa&s;torals, excepting tho&s;e in which he has deviated from the Country: And yet if it were put to your Choice, would you have your Name de&s;cend to Po&s;terity with the Reputation of either of tho&s;e Poets, rather than with that of <HI>Homer?</HI> Nothing can be more correct than the <HI>Erigone</HI> of <HI>Erato&s;thenes;</HI> but is he therefore a greater Poet than <HI>Archilochus,</HI> in who&s;e Compo&s;ures Per&s;picuity and Order are often wanting; the divine Fury of his Genius be|ing too impatient for Re&s;traint, and &s;uperior to Law? Again, do you prefer the Odes of <HI>Bacchilides</HI> to <HI>Pindar</HI>'s, or the Scenes of <HI>Ion</HI> of <HI>Chios</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>Sophocles?</HI> Their Writings are allow'd to be correct, polite, and delicate; whereas, on the other Hand, <HI>Pindar</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> &s;ome|times hurry on with the greate&s;t Impetuo&s;ity, and like a devouring Flame &s;eize and &s;et on Fire whatever comes in their way; but on a &s;udden the Conflagration is extin|gui&s;h'd, and they mo&s;t mi&s;erably flag when no body ex|pects it.
