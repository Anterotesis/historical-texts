<HEAD>AN ADDRESS to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE comedy here offered to the world, having been bani&s;hed from the theatre, through the rage of po|litical prejudice, and the author having, through that prejudice, been no le&s;s attacked in his reputation than wounded in his fortune, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for him to ju&s;tify his character as a man, however poor his abilities may be as a writer. &mdash; Popular re&s;entment has had it's victim, and the &s;acrifice being now over, perhaps a few words may be heard in his defence.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time, previous to the exhibition of the following &s;cenes, two charges were indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated again&s;t the author; and to the&s;e charges the unexampled &s;everity exerci&s;ed on his play may be wholly attributed: The fir&s;t was, that Mr. Kelly pro&s;tituted the Public Ledger, a daily paper then under his direction, to the purpo&s;es of admi|ni&s;tration, in con&s;equence of an annual pen&s;ion he received; and, in&s;tead of conducting it upon principles of impartiality, would admit no letters whatever, unle&s;s profe&s;&s;edly written in favour of government. &mdash; This accu&s;ation, though con&s;tantly rendered ab&s;urd by his readine&s;s to in&s;ert every proper letter on each &s;ide of every public &s;ubject, gained no little credit, but gained it intirely among tho&s;e who would not be at the trouble of examining into the truth. &mdash; At length the ca|lumny grew &s;erious enough to demand &s;ome notice, and accordingly, on the 14th of February, 1769, the following reply was publi&s;hed in the Ledger, to a fre&s;h attack by an anonymous corre&s;pondent upon the independency of that paper.</P>
<Q><P>We can a&s;&s;ure this gentleman (meaning the corre&s;pon|dent) that we have never &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any thing in favour of Mr. Wilkes's cau&s;e, which was in the lea&s;t proper for pub|lication: But declare on the contrary, that we always <HI>have</HI> been and always <HI>&s;hall</HI> be as ready to in&s;ert the productions of his friends, as the letters of his enemies. &mdash; Many pieces on <HI>both</HI> &s;ides have reached us, which we were under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of rejecting, becau&s;e they were too dangerous, or too ab&s;urd for admittance: yet we can with great truth aver, that we &s;trictly keep to our title, and maintain the mo&s;t di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate impartiality, &mdash; we profe&s;s <HI>our&s;elves open to all</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="3" MS="y">
<HI>parties,</HI> and cannot con&s;i&s;tently with this profe&s;&s;ion refu&s; <HI>any</HI> performance which &s;eems dictated by a &s;pirit of can dour, or an appearance of rational argument. Our cor|re&s;pondent, therefore, before he calls us <HI>partial,</HI> &s;hould really <HI>prove</HI> us &s;o; and &s;hould fir&s;t of all favour us with his e&s;&s;ays in <HI>defence</HI> of Mr. Wilkes, before he pronounces po&s;i|tively, that we will <HI>not</HI> indulge them with a <HI>place.</HI></P>
<P>In fact, a paper to maintain a <HI>real</HI> impartiality, mu&s;t be actuated by the principles of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> not by the fear of <HI>cen|&s;ure</HI> on the one hand, nor the hope of <HI>approbation</HI> on the other; and the conductors of it mu&s;t be more &s;olicitous to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> the applau&s;e of their readers, than to <HI>obtain</HI> it. &mdash; Had the managers of the Ledger for in&s;tance, rejected any piece which came <HI>again&s;t</HI> the cau&s;e of Mr. Wilkes, through an apprehen&s;ion of incurring the popular di&s;plea&s;ure, they would have violated the a&s;&s;urance of <HI>impartiality,</HI> which they have &s;o &s;olemnly given to the public, and the opponents of that gentleman, would have a rea&s;onable plea to reproach them with their palpable breach of faith. To accu&s;e them con&s;equently of <HI>partiality,</HI> argues a <HI>partiality</HI> in their accu|&s;ers; and it is rather unfair in tho&s;e, to deny others a li|berty of &s;peaking upon national affairs, who con&s;tantly lay claim to &s;uch a privilege them&s;elves,</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t however remember, that, though the Ledger is <HI>open</HI> to all parties, it is influenced by <HI>none</HI>: And that the conductors, to <HI>merit</HI> the good opinion of <HI>all,</HI> mu&s;t no more make a &s;acrifice of their ju&s;tice at the &s;hrine of <HI>popularity,</HI> than at the altar of <HI>government</HI>: they can therefore only repeat, that the advocates for Mr. Wilkes, will always be as acceptable to them, as any other corre&s;|pondents, and they <HI>call</HI> upon his friends in this manner, to favour them with productions in his defence. What more can be de&s;ired at their hands? If the popular writers decline this candid invitation, the editors of the Ledger are intirely free from blame. They have bound them&s;elves in a promi&s;e of undeviating impartiality to the <HI>whole</HI> public, and mu&s;t by no means act inequitably to tho&s;e who <HI>do</HI> oblige them with pieces for in&s;ertion, out of an unrea&s;on|able deference for tho&s;e who do <HI>not.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This adverti&s;ement Mr. Kelly flattered him&s;elf would effectually undeceive the public; but here he was unhap|pily di&s;appointed. Many who had repeatedly heard the charge again&s;t him, never once honoured the defence with a peru&s;al; while many more who really read it, con&s;idered the very candour of it's declaration as a proof of crimi|nality, and would not allow any weight to the argument of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> when oppo&s;ed to what they looked upon as the cau&s;e of the people. &mdash; Mr. Kelly, however, determined, at
<PB N="v" REF="4">
all events, to do his duty, conducted the Ledger on it's cu&s;tomary plan of <HI>impartiality,</HI> and many of the mo&s;t po|pular gentlemen who have arraigned his conduct in the capacity of a public editor, well know that their letters, in&s;tead of being rejected, have been frequently in&s;erted at the warning of an hour. &mdash; Be&s;ides, a review of the Ledger during Mr. Kelly's &s;uperintendency, will convince the mo&s;t incredulous, that the &s;evere&s;t animadver&s;ions were admitted on the proceedings of admini&s;tration. &mdash; It was not Mr. Kelly's fault if the publications on the contrary &s;ide were the mo&s;t numerous. &mdash; The corre&s;pondents of a news-paper will make it what they plea&s;e, and the editor is not to con&s;ider in who&s;e favour they write, but whether their writings are proper for in&s;ertion. &mdash; Whatever Mr. Kelly's own &s;entiments might be on political affairs, this was the only object of his inquiry: and it will appear, on a retro&s;pection of the pieces printed, while he directed the Ledger, that Mr. Kelly has frequently complimented popular writers on account of their abilities, and civilly reque&s;ted a continuation of their corre&s;pondence. &mdash; As to Mr. Kelly's own letters in the Ledger, they appeared but occa&s;ionally, from the number of volunteers who eager|ly crowded to the general &s;ervice: Yet he will candidly confe&s;s, that when they did appear, they were not always in favour of popularity. This con&s;titutes the &s;econd charge again&s;t him; and as he is above the de&s;picable littlene&s;s of prevaricating, he will enter with confidence, and he hopes with decency, upon his ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Whether it has been Mr. Kelly's merit or demerit, to think from principle unpopularly, on the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent un|happy di&s;&s;en&s;ions, he will not pretend to &s;ay, but certainly it has been his misfortune; and though &s;everal of his di&s;creeter friends repeatedly warned him of the danger his next piece would run on the &s;tage, from an open declaration of his poli|tical opinions; &s;till he did not imagine, that his profe&s;&s;ion as a public writer was to deprive him of his independence as a man &mdash;As he never pre&s;umed to be offended with the &s;entiments of others on matters of a national tendency, he claimed a right of expre&s;&s;ing his own; and did not &s;uppo&s;e his lite|rary character, precluded him from &s;peaking upon a point which was the continual object of literary inve&s;tigation. &mdash; Be&s;ides this, he little conceived that the advocates for free|dom of thinking, would be the fir&s;t to manacle the mind; that the profe&s;&s;ed friends of candour would be the fir&s;t to condemn without a hearing; and the avowed enemies of oppre&s;&s;ion be the only per&s;ons ready to exerci&s;e an unwar|rantable &s;everity &mdash; He had at lea&s;t a right to ju&s;tice, if he had no pretence to favour, and merited &s;urely a trial, though he might afterwards de&s;erve to be condemned.&mdash;
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
The heated hour of prejudice however, is not the hour of &s;ober reflection; at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on the very virtues of our hearts frequently lead us into mi&s;takes; and we run into exce&s;&s;es which our cooler rea&s;on mu&s;t di&s;approve, from an actual rectitude of intention. This was the ca&s;e of numbers who oppo&s;ed the exhibition of Mr. Kelly's play: they had been told he was a de&s;picable mercenary, hired to write away their liberties, and therefore con&s;idered him as a very im|proper candidate for public approbation &mdash; they had been informed, that at the memorable trials of Mr Gillam, and of the &s;oldier at Guildford, in con&s;equence of the un|happy affair in St. George's fields, he had &s;tood forth an advocate for the effu&s;ion of innocent blood; of cour&s;e they beheld him with dete&s;tation; and their motive was really re&s;pectable, though their re&s;entment was wholly ex|cited by mi&s;information or mi&s;take.</P>
<P>It is true indeed Mr. Kelly, as well as an account of the two remarkable trials ju&s;t mentioned, wrote, during the cour&s;e of our dome&s;tic di&s;union, many other papers in &s;up|port of government, and in vindication of parliament; but he never exerci&s;ed his trifling pen where he did not &s;uppo&s;e both to be right, nor delivered a &s;ingle &s;entence that was not the re&s;ult of his ample&s;t conviction. &mdash; With regard to the two trials, he repre&s;ented them as they really <HI>were,</HI> not as they might be <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> in print, by the <HI>over</HI> zealous advocates of freedom. &mdash; And &s;o far was he from being once employed, &s;ince his exi&s;tence, by admini&s;tration, to exert his poor abilities in their cau&s;e, that he here prote&s;ts, before the public, he never <HI>expected</HI> or <HI>received</HI> the &s;malle&s;t emo|lument for his little &s;ervices. &mdash; Never was <HI>directly</HI> or <HI>in|directly</HI> connected with a mini&s;ter in his days, nor has he even at this moment, though &s;uffering &s;o &s;everely on account of his attachment to government, either <HI>&s;olicited</HI> or <HI>received</HI> a &s;hilling compen&s;ation for that bread, which he and his family have lo&s;t in it's defence.</P>
<P>HERE po&s;&s;ibly Mr. Kelly may be a&s;ked, how, <Q>unplac'd, un|pen&s;ion'd, no man's heir or &s;lave,</Q> he could be idle enough to ri&s;k the favour of a town, that had honoured him with the warme&s;t marks of approbation in his fir&s;t dramatic attempt, for the mere purpo&s;e of &s;erving a government from which he had not received the minute&s;t favour or protection? To this Mr. Kelly replies, that in &s;erving government, where he thought it <HI>ought</HI> to be &s;erved, he looked upon him&s;elf as rendering very e&s;&s;ential benefit to the community. &mdash; Know|ing it the duty of every good &s;ubject to promote, in&s;tead of di&s;turbing, the national tranquility, he u&s;ed his humble endeavours, rather to extingui&s;h than animate the torch of public di&s;cord, and &s;trove, as far as &s;o in&s;ignificant an in|dividual
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
could &s;trive, to wre&s;t it from the hand of every po|litical enthu&s;ia&s;t, who madly attempted to &s;et his country in flames. With this view he particularly gave an account of the two trials that have expo&s;ed him to &s;o much unmerited obloquy. Being well convinced, that, during the rage of party, truth would undergo a torture upon the wheel of prejudice, Mr. Kelly, determined to give a faithful narrative of the&s;e remarkable deci&s;ions. He accordingly attended; he accordingly gave a real &s;tate of both to the world; and though he has been calumniated in the gro&s;s, as a &s;hamele&s;s abettor of murder, no attempt has hitherto been made to point out, in his repre&s;entation, the &s;malle&s;t perver&s;ion of a fact. &mdash; This was ea&s;y to be done, had he been employed as the verni&s;her of guilt; the trials were not carried on in &s;ecret, but in the full face of day; not &s;olely before the re|tainers of a court, but before the warme&s;t &s;ons of popularity: Mr. Kelly was not culpable if the pri&s;oners were wholly without blame; he only acquitted tho&s;e in his relation, who were acquitted by the laws of their country, and only ex|plained <HI>how</HI> that innocence was made apparent, which the <HI>too</HI> deci&s;&s;ive voice of partiality had previou&s;ly condemned.</P>
<P>Mr. Kelly's account of the trials was received with general &s;urprize, becau&s;e the public, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of papers in the daily and other prints, had been taught to con&s;ider Mr. Gillam and the &s;oldier unque&s;tionably guilty. &mdash; On their acquittal therefore the <HI>intemperate</HI> friends to the po|pular cau&s;e, (Mr. Kelly &s;ays the <HI>intemperate</HI> friends, becau&s;e he knows many of the mo&s;t rational, as well as the mo&s;t wor|thy members of the community, from <HI>principle</HI> in oppo&s;ition,) wi&s;hed to throw a &s;tigma on the court, where they were tried, and wi&s;hed to prejudice the world with an opinion, that both owed their pre&s;ervation more to the dexterity of judicial chicane, than to their real innocence. &mdash; Mr. Kelly, however, by &s;etting the tran&s;actions in a plain, an hone&s;t light, prevented the intended in&s;ult to the courts, but drew the whole weight of party re&s;entment upon him&s;elf, and the doctrine having been long &s;ucce&s;sfully inculcated among the people, that whoever &s;poke, much le&s;s whoever wrote, again&s;t popular prejudices, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the hireling of government, Mr. Kelly became gradually &s;tigmatized into &s;uch a por|tion of politcal con&s;equence, that the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his co|medy was con&s;idered as a triumph over admini&s;tration; &s;o that the curtain was no &s;ooner rai&s;ed on the fir&s;t night than a loud hi&s;&s;ing prevented the performers from begin|ning the play a considerable time; &mdash; while on the other hand, the plaudits of Mr. Kelly's numerous friends, to who&s;e goodne&s;s he &s;tands eternally indebted, as well as of the unprejudiced, who de&s;ired to give him a fair hearing, and afterwards to expre&s;s their cen&s;ure or approbation, render|ed the confu&s;ion general. At la&s;t the performance com|menced
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
&mdash; but went on with ince&s;&s;ant interruptions; except only in the third act, to the conclu&s;ion. The performers totally di&s;concerted by the tumult, were unable to exerci&s;e their abilities, or to remember their parts &mdash; whole &s;peeches, e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the conduct of the fable, were left out, and others mutilated for the &s;ake of brevity. &mdash;In &s;hort, the &s;ole con&s;ideration was to get the comedy through the five acts in <HI>any manner.</HI> &mdash; This, with much difficulty, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffected, and it was given out for the following Monday. A new conte&s;t now aro&s;e: the oppo&s;ers of the play in&s;i&s;ted, with an uncu&s;tomary &s;everity, that it &s;hould never be exhibited again. &mdash; The &s;upporters in&s;i&s;ted that it &s;hould, on the Mon|day, according to the public intimation from Mr. King; but Mr. Kelly, fearing the con&s;equences of a di&s;pute that appeared extremely &s;erious, propo&s;ed behind the &s;cenes, to withdraw his piece at once, for the &s;ake of re&s;toring peace, and the tragedy of Cymbeline was given out in it's room.</P>
<P>This conciliating mea&s;ure, however, was not attended with the de&s;ired effect. The friends of the play, who were greatly the majority, would by no means admit the comedy to be withdrawn; and, after the farce, above two hundred gentle|men calling out for the manager, and threatening immediate demolition, to the hou&s;e, if A WORD to the WISE was not performed, as originally given out, Mr. Lacy, the only manager then in town, &s;ent Mr. Hopkins, the prompter, to a&s;&s;ure the company it &s;hould, and all terminated peaceably for that evening.</P>
<P>It was no difficult matter to fore&s;ee that the theatre, on the &s;ucceeding Monday night, would be a &s;cene of fre&s;h tumult; and the con&s;equences appearing more and more alarming to Mr. Kelly, he went to Mr. Garrick, who came to town on the Sunday morning, to con&s;ult with him on the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving peace, and it was concluded, that Mr. Kelly &s;hould wait on his friends, and reque&s;t that they would give up the point. &mdash; Mr. Kelly accordingly did &s;o, ob&s;erv|ing, that the intere&s;ts of a &s;ingle individual were of little con&s;ideration, when weighed again&s;t the repo&s;e of a whole public. &mdash; He ob&s;erved, as he has repeatedly done in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent narrative, that prejudices had been &s;trongly propagated again&s;t him, and that the very &s;everity he had experienced from many of his enemies, though un|ju&s;tifiable in the manner, yet in the motive was really lauda|ble. The moment of party heat, he frequently added, was not the moment to rea&s;on; and that however he might be injured in his circum&s;tances, by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his play, he would &s;uffer the injury with plea&s;ure, if he could by any means re&s;tore the tranquility of the town, which he had &s;o un|happily, though &s;o innocently, di&s;turbed. &mdash; To this his friends replied, that the cau&s;e was not his cau&s;e now, but
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
the public's; that if party di&s;putes were once introduced into the theatre, our mo&s;t rational amu&s;ements mu&s;t be quickly at an end, that the number of writers at pre&s;ent for the &s;tage was &s;ufficiently &s;mall, and that they would not &s;uffer the town to be controuled in it's plea&s;ures from private pique or per&s;onal re&s;entment: all they contended for was a fair hearing for the piece; that if it de&s;erved condemna|tion, they them&s;elves would be the fir&s;t to give it up; but, till it received an equitable trial, they would not allow a triumph to prejudice profe&s;&s;ed, and acknowledged partiality.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the affair re&s;ted till the Monday evening, when, on Mr. King's appearance, to &s;peak the prologue, the oppo&s;ition, with increa&s;ed numbers, hi&s;&s;ed, cat-called, and threw oranges: on the other &s;ide the demand for the new play was equally violent, the &s;upporters turned &s;everal out of the hou&s;e, whom they con&s;idered as general di&s;turbers; however Mr. Garrick went on, in the author's name, with a formal renunciation of every emolument, of every reputa|tion ari&s;ing from his &s;mall endeavours for the public amu&s;e|ment; adding, that he was not only ready, but de&s;irous to concur with their plea&s;ure, though to the total di&s;appoint|ment both of his wi&s;hes and intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and begged the &s;acri|fice he then &s;o chearfully offered might be allowed to ter|minate the contention. Things neverthele&s;s continued in the &s;ame confu&s;ion for a con&s;iderable time, &mdash; during which Mr. Garrick often retired and returned, &mdash; but at la&s;t advanced with a paper in his hand, from Mr. Kelly, containing a written repetition of the foregoing reque&s;t, and de&s;iring permi&s;&s;ion, as the only means of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing harmony, to withdraw his comedy wholly from the theatre.</P>
<P>When Mr. Garrick attempted to read this paper, a de|mand was made from the gallery, to know whether it was a political production, but though the demand occa&s;ioned no little laughter among the oppo&s;ers of the piece, it only augmented the &s;pirit of the author's friends, by rendering the views of party &s;till more and more vi&s;ible. &mdash; The play of Cymbeline being loudly in&s;i&s;ted upon on the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd, was loudly prohibited on the other; and near three hours having pa&s;&s;ed in acts of annoyance and ho&s;tility, Mr. Kelly was &s;o exceedingly alarmed for the event, that he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e him&s;elf into the front boxes, and from the fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t boxes, on the galleries calling out they could not &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, into the pit, and there, turning towards the audience, he expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions for their &s;afety, begged they would be &s;atisfied with what he had done, which was all he had in his power to do for their pre&s;ervation, and not, by injuring one another, wound him irreparably in his peace.</P>
<P>Though in no degree &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as he wi&s;hed, he ne|verthele&s;s &s;o far prevailed, that a propo&s;ition on his
<PB N="x" REF="9">
retiring was &s;ugge&s;ted for Fal&s;e Delicacy to be given the en&s;uing night, for his benefit by way of compromi&s;e: a gen|tleman then &s;tood up in the pit, and a&s;ked Mr. Garrick, whether con&s;enting to the&s;e mea&s;ures would, or would not, be an impediment to Mr. Kelly's bringing any future productions on the &s;tage &mdash; to which that gentleman had no &s;ooner given a negative, than a &s;econd per&s;on from the gallery cried out, Expul&s;ion means incapacitation. Mr. Kelly, acquainted with the&s;e particulars, went to Mr. Garrick and declined the favour intended him &mdash; ob&s;erving, that he by no means meant to wring a benefit from the cha|rity of the public &mdash; that if he de&s;erved one benefit he was intitled to three, and that the theatre had already &s;u&s;tained &s;ufficient lo&s;s upon his account. &mdash; But Mr. Garrick generou&s;ly told him, that the theatre was much the be&s;t able to bear a lo&s;s; though, &s;uppo&s;ing the ca&s;e otherwi&s;e, neither he nor Mr. Kelly, as public men, had a right on that occa&s;ion to di&s;pute a determination of the public. Here the matter re&s;ted for that night, as there was no play, the money was returned, and the audience retired &s;eemingly well recon|ciled.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the compromi&s;e of the foregoing even|ing, and notwith&s;tanding Mr. Kelly de&s;ired that the play|bills &s;hould contain no intimation that the performance of Fal&s;e Delicacy was intended for his benefit, a report univer|&s;ally prevailed that the oppo&s;ition were determined not to &s;uffer the exhibition of Fal&s;e Delicacy, which had long been honoured with the approbation of all parties, merely becau&s;e it was written by the author of a Word to the Wi&s;e. Mr. Kelly on this, imagining that the circum&s;tance of his being to receive the profits, of the night, and not any objection which could be rai&s;ed to an e&s;tabli&s;hed comedy, mu&s;t be the &s;ole foundation of this fre&s;h re&s;entment, waited upon his friends and begged they would allow him to relinqui&s;h his title to the&s;e profits &s;ince they were &s;o likely to renew the di&s;turbances of the theatre. His friends however were for a long time inflexible &mdash; they pronounced a violation of the compromi&s;e, no le&s;s injurious to the public, than in|&s;ulting to them, and added, that they would never have li&s;ten|ed to any compromi&s;e, if he had not been &s;o importunately &s;olicitous to give up every thing for peace &mdash; but Mr. Kelly repre&s;enting the prejudice the managers mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily &s;u&s;tain, by a contention of the pre&s;ent nature between the public, and pointing out the prejudice al&s;o which every individual belonging to the play-hou&s;e mu&s;t as nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;tain, by an interruption of the cu&s;tomary bu|&s;ine&s;s &mdash; his friends yielded to the&s;e arguments, and permit|ted Mr. Kelly to forego the advantages of the night, to
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
prevent the managers and the performers from &s;uffering in a di&s;pute, where it was equally their intere&s;t and their duty to con&s;ult the wi&s;hes of the auditors.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions being taken by Mr. Kelly, he repaired to the theatre on the Tue&s;day evening with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction; but, on the opening of the play the confu|&s;ion was as violent as ever, though Mr. Garrick, from Mr. Kelly, a&s;&s;ured the oppo&s;ition, that the play was not to be per|formed for the benefit of the author &mdash; This a&s;&s;urance how|ever was by no means &s;ufficient; the comedy of Fal&s;e Deli|cacy was written by Mr. Kelly, and therefore though in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage among the number of &s;tock play<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, was now to be condemned &mdash; to effect this purpo&s;e, an up|roar in the theatre was not only judged nece&s;&s;ary, but the following hand bill was di&s;tributed at all the doors.</P>

<P>The heat with which proceedings were thus conducted on the part of oppo&s;ition, gave room to imagine, that the audi|ence would, as upon the preceding night, be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out any play. &mdash; But Mr. Kelly's friends were now no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s their indignation, and being determined to make no farther conce&s;&s;ions, they exerted them&s;elves &s;o effec|tually, that Fal&s;e Delicacy was performed, though with very con&s;iderable interruption. &mdash; Whole &s;peeches, nay, whole &s;cenes were obliged to be omitted, and &s;uch was the rage of undi&s;tingui&s;hing prejudice, that it even attacked the per&s;onal &s;afety of the female performers &mdash; This was not all, when the attempt to &s;uppre&s;s Fal&s;e Delicacy proved abortive, the ene|mies of the author demanded their money, and appeared
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
unwilling to pay for the mi&s;chief they really <HI>did,</HI> becau&s;e, they had not effected as much as they actually <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> to <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the farce happily produced a general calm, and though the theatrical horizon &s;eemed pregnant with a &s;torm the &s;ucceeding evening, it's &s;erenity &s;till continued, and perhaps, will never be again di&s;turbed by any of Mr. Kelly's productions. There is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary to add with regard to the exhibition of <HI>A Wora to the Wi&s;e,</HI> than that &s;uch was the judicious conduct of Mr. Garrick and Mr. King, that what they gained on the one hand, they never lo&s;t on the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the amu&s;ement of the public had in the fir&s;t in|&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> been the only object of their attention, &s;o it was ap|parent the public tranquility was, in the &s;econd, the only ob|ject of their care: And whatever inconveniences they them|&s;elves might be expo&s;ed to, they were incapable of deviating from the rules of politene&s;s, of good &s;en&s;e, and manly con|de&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>After a &s;acrifice of his intere&s;t, &s;o ample, &s;o unre&s;erved, for the &s;ake of re&s;toring tranquility in the theatre, it might perhaps be expected that Mr. Kelly's enemies would have thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently gratified; but prejudice has many appetites to glut, and we &s;eldom li&s;ten to the &s;en|timents of ju&s;tice, where we have publicly committed a vio|lence upon our rea&s;on. &mdash; It was therefore no way wonderful, though his cau&s;e was the common cau&s;e of letters, to find many of the periodical prints con&s;tantly filled with the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t &s;currilities again&s;t him; but, in this they rather gratified his pride, than wounded his &s;en&s;ibility; they only exalted him on the roll of &s;lander, among the mo&s;t illu&s;trious cha|racters in the kingdom, and made him an object of impor|tance, by making him an object of implacable re&s;entment.</P>
<P>One attack however he cannot help mentioning in this place, though it leads to a repetition of the Guildford Trial, becau&s;e it came from a quarter wholly unexpected; and from a quarter al&s;o too re&s;pectable to be overlooked, from the reve|rend Mr. Horne, at the meeting of the Middle&s;ex freeholders at Mile-End, on Friday the 30th of April. At this meeting Mr. Horne, in &s;umming up the various grievances under which he &s;uppo&s;ed the nation groaning from the tyranny of admini&s;tration, took occa&s;ion to de&s;cant on the &s;oldier's trial for the murder of the unfortunate Mr. Allen, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus &mdash; <Q>It is nece&s;&s;ary to give you an account of Maclean's trial, becau&s;e the judge forbad it's being taken down by any one, <HI>except it was government.</HI> &mdash; It has never been publi&s;hed &mdash; A very fal&s;e account of this trial has indeed been publi&s;hed by Mr. KELLY, who was paid and brought to Guildford for that purpo&s;e, and who had lodgings taken for him there, and who was familiarly conver&s;ant with a gen|tleman, who&s;e name I &s;hall not mention now, le&s;t it &s;hould
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
&s;eem to proceed from re&s;entment in me, for an account I have to &s;ettle with him next week; however one circum&s;tance I ought to tell you; this gentleman was foreman of the grand jury.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Without dwelling on Mr. Horne's extraordinary tenderne&s;s to the gentleman who&s;e name he will not mention, while he points him clearly out to every apprhen&s;ion, Mr. Kelly will &s;uppo&s;e that what was a&s;&s;erted with regard to him, Mr. Horne him&s;elf believed to be indi&s;putably true &mdash; Nay, Mr. Kelly is &s;eriou&s;ly of this opinion, becau&s;e many gen|tlemen of unque&s;tionable veracity have a&s;&s;ured him, that, ab|&s;tracted from the intemperance of party, Mr. Horne is in his under&s;tanding enlarged, and in his di&s;po&s;ition liberal. On the&s;e accounts however, Mr. Kelly differed from the po|litician, he always re&s;pected Mr Horne's private character, and did ju&s;tice to what he con&s;idered the well meaning, though mi&s;taken zeal of the &s;oirited freeholder, in the moment of his deepe&s;t concern at hearing a mini&s;ter of peace, preach|ing di&s;cord through his country, and expre&s;&s;ing an impatience of dying the ve&s;tments of his &s;acred function, in the blood of his fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But though Mr. Kelly readily makes this conce&s;&s;ion in favour of Mr. Horne's private character, he mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the con&s;titution of this country, for the purity of which Mr. Horne is &s;o &s;trenuous an advocate, does not allow the mere <HI>belief</HI> of any man to be <HI>po&s;itive</HI> evidence, nor com|pliment his &s;imple <HI>conjecture</HI> with the force of a <HI>fact.</HI> &mdash; For this rea&s;on, Mr. Horne &s;hould be extremely cautious how he a&s;&s;erts any thing to the prejudice of another's reputation; <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> authority is not enough for this purpo&s;e; he &s;hould know of his own <HI>knowledge</HI> what he a&s;&s;erts upon his own <HI>word</HI>; and be <HI>certain</HI> in his <HI>proof,</HI> where he is <HI>peremptory</HI> in his <HI>accu|&s;ation.</HI> &mdash; If a circum&s;pection of this nature is nece&s;&s;ary in every man of honour, it mu&s;t give Mr. Horne much mortification to hear, after he has repre&s;ented Hugh Kelly, to the free|holders of Middle&s;ex, as a venal &s;cribler, a &s;hamele&s;s in&s;trument of power, an atrocious defender of murder, that the whole charge &s;hould be utterly groundle&s;s&mdash; That Kelly's account of Maclean's trial, &s;hould be true in every circum&s;tance, that Kel|ly never expected or received a &s;hilling for writing it, and that in the cour&s;e of his days he has not once changed a &s;yllable with Mr On&s;low, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>conver&s;ant familiarity</HI> at Guildford.</P>
<P>Strange however as all the&s;e things mu&s;t appear, after Mr. Horne's po&s;itive affirmation to the contrary, all the&s;e things are mo&s;t religiou&s;ly veritable; and Mr. Horne is in this public manner called upon to prove an iota of his charge; it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;upport his own allegations, not Mr. Kelley's, to
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
endeavour at e&s;tabli&s;hing negatives. &mdash; Let him therefore &s;pi|ritedly proceed to his proofs. &mdash; He has pronounced Mr. Kelly guilty, let him now &s;hew in what his guilt con&s;i&s;ts. &mdash; The mo&s;t tyrannical mini&s;ter can do no more than convict without evidence&mdash;in him however de&s;poti&s;m is to be expected. But &s;urely the rigid advocate for ju&s;tice will not follow &s;o dangerous an example; he will act rea&s;onably while he con|tends for rea&s;on, and conduct him&s;elf upon principles of legality, while he is generou&s;ly &s;truggling for the pre&s;ervation of the laws.</P>
<P>In reality, if there is no more foundation in Mr. Horne's celebrated &s;peech, for the charges brought again&s;t govern|ment, than for the charges urged again&s;t Mr. Kelly, the catalogue of public grievances is rather ludicrous than me|lancholy. But without troubling Mr. Horne to &s;upport his a&s;&s;ertions, Mr. Kelly will &s;hew the&s;e very a&s;&s;ertions &s;elf-refuted; he will prove them as incon&s;i&s;tent, as they are po&s;itive, and re&s;t his defence entirely on the nature of Mr. Horne's accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mr. Horne &s;ets out with &s;aying that the judge would not &s;uffer the trial to be taken down by any body, except it was for government &mdash; Several neverthele&s;s took it down, and among the re&s;t Mr. Chinnery and Mr. Gurney the profe&s;&s;ed &s;hort hand writers&mdash;Numbers be&s;ides committed the mo&s;t ma|terial pa&s;&s;ages to paper, and &s;ome to Mr. Kelly's knowledge <HI>not</HI> for Government; but, Mr. Kelly will &s;ay, that had he been hired by <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> for the infamous purpo&s;e Mr. Horne mentions, it is not likely that the u&s;e of a pen would have been at all permitted in the court; it is not likely, that the judge would allow a <HI>real</HI> account of a trial to be taken, where a pro&s;titute writer was particularly employed to <HI>mi&s;re|pre&s;ent</HI> it, nor is it likely that the mini&s;try, while wi&s;hing to &s;tand well with the world, would furni&s;h &s;uch palpable evidence of it's own di&s;honour&mdash;If there was any thing ille|gal in the proceeding of the court &mdash; If an unwarrantable &s;tretch of power re&s;cued the pri&s;oner from ju&s;tice, why has not the tran&s;action been held up to univer&s;al in dignation? &mdash; Why is it not recorded in the li&s;t of grievances pre&s;ented to the throne? &mdash; To make a &s;olemn court of judicature the pan|dar of de&s;potic authority would have been a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude; it would have &s;haken the con&s;titution to it's centre, and overwhelmed the mini&s;ter with inevitable de&s;truction. &mdash; But, wicked as &s;ome gentlemen in oppo&s;ition might &s;uppo&s;e the Government, they could not &s;uppo&s;e it weak enough to overturn the laws thus de&s;perately at once, for the mere end of &s;aving a private foot &s;oldier from puni&s;h|ment; a pardon was an ea&s;y expedient, and mercy was not then con&s;idered criminal&mdash;Be&s;ides, were the o&s;ten&s;ible men in power as ruthle&s;s as they have been painted, they would
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
have given the pri&s;oner up at once, they would have been regardle&s;s of his fate, nor would they have attempted to &s;ave him from the gibbet, by methods that mu&s;t have un|avoidably hurried them&s;elves to the block. The que&s;tion is not whether the unhappy Mr. Allen lo&s;t a &s;on, but Whe|ther that &s;on fell by the hands of Maclean? &mdash; Humanity is melted when it thinks of a &s;laughtered child, and a weeping father &mdash; But humanity mu&s;t &s;till be ju&s;t &mdash; it mu&s;t not with for victims without guilt, nor dry up the tears of &s;orrowing relations with a &s;acrifice of unoffending blood.</P>
<P>The la&s;t part of Mr. Horne's a&s;&s;ertion is to the full as ex|traordinary as the fir&s;t. Mr. Kelly is made culpable for being <HI>farmiliarly conver&s;ant</HI> with the foreman of the grand jury at <HI>Guildford</HI>; though certainly, if there was a nece&s;&s;ity for any mention of the grand juryman he ought to be mentioned with re&s;pect; becau&s;e the grand jury <HI>found</HI> the bill <HI>again&s;t</HI> Maclean, and con&s;equently, in that circum&s;tance, advanced the very wi&s;hes of popularity &mdash; In&s;tead therefore of con|demning Mr. Kelly for his intimacy with Mr. On&s;low in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that intimacy ought to be an argument in Mr. Kelly's favour &mdash; But the truth is, Mr. Kelly in the whole cour&s;e of his exi&s;tence, never once &s;poke to Mr. On&s;low, the grand juryman alluded to, knowing who he was, nor he believes at any rate, becau&s;e he knows Mr. On&s;low's per&s;on, and is flattered with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tol|lerable memory&mdash;however, if Mr. Horne has evidence to the contrary&mdash;let him produce it &mdash; if not, let him for the future be more certain of his facts, or le&s;s peremptory in his a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly, though Mr. Horne is a &s;trong enemy to exa|mination by interrogatory, he may neverthele&s;s choo&s;e to a&s;k Mr. Kelly what bu&s;ine&s;s carried him to Guildford, if he did not go as a literary pro&s;titute in favour of govern|ment? To this Mr. Kelly will reply with another que&s;tion, What bu&s;ine&s;s had Mr. Horne there? Mr. Kelly &s;urely has as much right to indulge his curio&s;ity, and to &s;upport what he conceives a ju&s;t cau&s;e, as that gentleman &mdash; Mr. Horne cannot be a warmer well wi&s;her to true freedom, and to na|tional happine&s;s than Mr. Kelly, though he pur&s;ues a very different plan of promoting them &mdash; Mr. Kelly's political opinions may be erroneous &mdash; but his intention is right &mdash; Had he been the venal thing he is repre&s;ented, he might have carried his venality to a certain market &mdash; Popular ap|plau&s;e is always fortune to a public writer of prudence, and the part Mr. Kelly has taken may be an impeachment of his judgment, but argues no depravity of his heart.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, with regard to Mr. Horne, if Mr. Kelly's account of the Guildford trial i. fal&s;e, let Mr. Horne point
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
the fallacy out; if Mr. Kelly has been hired to write it let Mr. Horne mention by whom&mdash;and if it is criminal to be <HI>familiarly conver&s;ant</HI> with Mr. On&s;low, let Mr. Horne &s;upport a &s;ingle in&s;tance of Mr. Kelly's familiarity with that gentle|man. &mdash; Mr. Horne &s;oon after Mr. Kelly's account of the Guildford trial appeared, promi&s;ed the world <HI>a true &s;tate</HI> of that remarkable affair, and if Mr. Kelly &s;hamefully mi&s;repre|&s;ented facts, the appearance of Mr. Horne's pamphlet was doubly nece&s;&s;ary &mdash; That pamphlet has never yet appeared; and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a temper &s;o ready to fire at light occa&s;ions as Mr. Horne's, would &s;uppre&s;s it, had there been any material cau&s;e of complaint to lay before the people.</P>
<P>Mr. Kelly has taken up a great deal of room with his tri|fling concerns, for which he ought to apologize, but as the publication of his play by &s;ub&s;cription, proceeded entirely from the generous partiality of his friends, he thought it his duty to let them at lea&s;t &s;ee, that though they might be &s;up|porting a dull writer, they were encouraging an hone&s;t man&mdash;The piece, with all it's imperfections on it's head, is now before the world; and the author hopes, if it &s;hould even &s;et the reader fa&s;t a&s;leep, that nothing it contains will rouze his indignation: the mo&s;t careful father he thinks may put it into the hands of his daughter, without any fear of wounding her delicacy, or unhinging her principles&mdash;This is it's chief, perhaps it's only merit, and perhaps, had it been heard on the &s;tage with patience, it might have been condemned with ju&s;tice &mdash; Mr. Kelly will therefore con&s;ole him&s;elf with his optimi&s;t Willoughby, by thinking every thing happens for the be&s;t, and look upon that very prejudice which has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his poor performance as ultimately for|tunate, &s;ince it may have been the means of pre&s;erving his little &s;hare of reputation.</P>
<P>He cannot however conclude this addre&s;s without an ob|&s;ervation or two upon the melancholy &s;ituation of dramatic writers&mdash;and as it is po&s;&s;ible that he him&s;elf may never more venture a production on the &s;tage, he hopes what he has further to advance, will merit an additional con&s;idera|tion from his readers.</P>
<P>The great decline of dramatic genius in this country, has been for many years an object of general concern with the public, and the lovers of the theatre have ardently wi&s;hed, that &s;ome happy &s;timulus might be di&s;covered to encrea&s;e the number of writers for the &s;tage; yet, though this wi&s;h has prevailed univer&s;ally, and though the credit, as well as the emolument ari&s;ing from a &s;ucce&s;sful play is not; a little tempting, &s;till the danger attending the repre&s;entation of the be&s;t pieces, is &s;o con&s;iderable, that the few writers ble&s;&s;ed with ea&s;y fortunes do not choo&s;e to run the hazard, and
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
mo&s;t of tho&s;e who live by the &s;ale of their productions, are content to follow &s;tudies le&s;s profitable, for a more cer|tain reward of their labours.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the difficulty, the toil, the downright drudgery of writing a good play is inconceivable; it is a work which requires long time and a clo&s;e application; it is a work in which neither the mo&s;t exten&s;ive erudition, nor the mo&s;t ac|curate under&s;tanding can en&s;ure an author &s;ucce&s;s&mdash; In eve|ry other &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, judgment, genius, and edu|cation are almo&s;t certain of a triumph&mdash;but here knowledge of the world is indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite&mdash;An acquaintance with the manners, and with the pa&s;&s;ions is requi&s;ite. &mdash; Nor are the&s;e &s;ufficient without an invention to &s;trike out variety; and a &s;kill to produce effects, by a forcible di&s;play of &s;itua|tion &mdash; It is not the good &s;en&s;e only of an audience which is addre&s;&s;ed &mdash; but their feelings; they mu&s;t be agreeably &s;ur|prized while they are publicly in&s;tructed, and the Mu&s;e, like other beauties, mu&s;t be ravi&s;hing to the general eye, before &s;he can be dear to the general heart.</P>
<P>When therefore the difficulty attending a dramatic work is &s;o con&s;iderable; when perhaps there is another con&s;iderable difficulty to get a play received by the &s;tage, and another &s;till to find a capital company of performers to repre&s;ent it, in&s;tead of wondering that the number of writers is &s;o &s;mall, we &s;hould in reality wonder how it is &s;o re&s;pectable. &mdash; But if we look &s;till farther, we &s;hall be &s;urprized that <HI>any</HI> author ri&s;ks his bark upon the dangerous ocean of the theatre &mdash; It is a melancholy truth, that the people who write mo&s;t for the &s;tage, are rather remarkable for their inge|nuity than their opulence. &mdash; On this account a di&s;appoint|ment to them is an e&s;&s;ential misfortune. Yet a few private enemies can at all times fru&s;trate their expectations. In vain an unfortunate man of letters may labour for many months with a laudable view of entertaining the town, and improv|ing his own circum&s;tances; &mdash; and in vain he may exert his utmo&s;t efforts to merit the protection of an audience, if he has unhappily given one individual an offence. The moment his piece is talked of, a party is po&s;&s;ibly formed to damn it; and many who would not join this party from malevolence, give it countenance, for the plea&s;ure, as it is called, <HI>of kick|ing up a riot in the playhou&s;e.</HI> &mdash; Thus the littlene&s;s of per|&s;onal pique, and the levity of incon&s;iderate laughter, have the poet totally at their mercy. &mdash; The curtain ri&s;es, and the &s;torm begins; nor can the generous interpo&s;ition of nine tenths among the auditors pre&s;erve the play from de&s;truc|tion. There is as much confu&s;ion created by the de&s;ire of <Q><HI>go on, go on,</HI>  as by the cry, <HI>go off, go off.</HI></Q> What|ever di&s;turbs the repre&s;entation has a tendency to injure it;
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
&s;o that a performance exhibited during a &s;tate of contention mu&s;t de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s; &mdash; the &s;upporters con&s;tantly interrupted have no opportunity of being entertained, and naturally enough, perhaps attribute the fault to the author; while the oppo&s;ition deci&s;ively pronouncing upon what is predetermined not to hear, kindly brands him with the epithet of an incorrigible, dance, and, not content with the injury done to his fortune, makes an equal attack upon his literary character.</P>
<P>Such being the &s;ituation of dramatic genius in this country, let the public them&s;elves judge, whether an author has any mighty encouragement to write for the &s;tage. &mdash; Perhaps the poet, treated in the manner now de&s;cribed, has no dependence but his talents; perhaps upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the very piece thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed he built his chief e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in life, and founded every future pro&s;pect of bringing up a growing family with reputation. &mdash; What mu&s;t his feel|ings then be, to find his hopes all bla&s;ted in a &s;ingle hour &mdash; to find the very labour, po&s;&s;ibly of years, de&s;troyed in an in&s;tant, by the people for who&s;e entertainment he laboured; and to &s;ee the bread not only wre&s;ted from the hands of his unoffending little ones, but to &s;ee them even expo&s;ed to the &s;till per&s;ecuting re&s;entment of prejudice, for the imaginary offences of their father. &mdash; What mu&s;t be his feelings &mdash; Yet for|bear humanity to inquire &mdash; the an&s;wer will harrow up your bo&s;om &mdash; Genero&s;ity, turn away from the picture, it mu&s;t deluge you with tears.&mdash;The &s;cene of poetical di&s;tre&s;s however &s;ketched to the reader's imagination, thanks to the goodne&s;s of Providence, is far from being Mr. Kelly's &s;ituation; but it often has been, and often may be, the &s;itu|ation of a much worthier man.&mdash;Mr. Kelly is affluent beyond his merits&mdash;nay, beyond his utmo&s;t hopes, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the riches of content in a very exten&s;ive manner, and can &s;it down to his humble repa&s;t with plea&s;ure, in the hone&s;t recol|lection that it is punctually paid for.</P>
<P>The difficulties here pointed out, for dramatic genius to encounter, are difficulties to which every writer for the &s;tage is con&s;tantly expo&s;ed; but the danger becomes infinitely more formidable, if, in times of party feud, he renders him&s;elf in the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable to the popular &s;ide of the que&s;tion; the unreflecting virtue of numbers then, as in Mr. Kelly's ca&s;e, will arm again&s;t him, and think it meritorious to condemn the production, that puni&s;hment may be inflicted upon the imputed delinquency of the man. &mdash; In times like the pre&s;ent therefore, what is a dramatic writer to do? &mdash; To hold his tongue, replies cold blooded prudence. &mdash; And what has the unfortunate man of letters committed, that he alone of all the community is to be denied the privilege of &s;peaking his &s;entiments? Say, ye various &s;ons of &s;cience, will you &s;ub|mit
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
to this de&s;picable &s;lavery of the mind? Are you, above the generality of mankind, di&s;tingui&s;hed for your education and your under&s;tanding, to be refu&s;ed an opinion, where an opi|nion is deemed the birth-right of your meane&s;t fellow-&s;ub|ject? Shall it be your glory to inculcate le&s;&s;ons of genero&s;ity and independence, and yet be your crime to practi&s;e the&s;e le&s;&s;ons your&s;elves? &mdash; Shall your writings breathe the noble&s;t &s;pirit of candour, and your lives be a round of the poore&s;t di&s;&s;imulation? &mdash; Shall you think your country in dan|ger, and yet be afraid to &s;peak a &s;yllable for it's pre&s;er|vation? &mdash; No, you will not tear the &s;iner principles from your brea&s;ts; you will not &s;et an example of &s;o abject a di&s;ingenuity. &mdash; Whatever meets the approbation of your judgment, will be &s;upported by the &s;anction of your voice, and however you may meet with reproach, you will at lea&s;t be careful not to de&s;erve it. &mdash; When admini&s;tration is inde|fen&s;ible, you will be too hone&s;t to combat in it's cau&s;e; but, at the &s;ame time you will not he&s;itate to condemn the errors of popularity. &mdash; You will be always animated by a real &s;olicitude for the public, and be as careful to guard again&s;t the extravagance of it's over-zealous friends, as to provide again&s;t the machinations of it's mo&s;t politic enemies. &mdash; Acting thus you may be poor, but you will ever be re&s;pectable. &mdash; Po&s;terity will do you ju&s;tice, if you are even oppre&s;&s;ed by your cotemporaries, and you will find ample re&s;ources in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your integrity, to compen&s;ate for the &s;evere&s;t di&s;appointments in your fortune.</P>
<P>To conclude &mdash; If men of talents have an equal right of thinking with the re&s;t of their fellow-&s;ubjects, and if they are not precluded by the generally acknowledged &s;uperiority of their under&s;tandings, from declaring their &s;entiments upon &s;ubjects of national importance, the lovers of the drama mu&s;t &s;ee that nothing can be &s;o dangerous to the exi&s;tence of genius, as the introduction of political di&s;putes into the theatre. The party which condemns a writer of different principles on one day, may &s;ee a favourite author, &s;acrificed the very next by their enemies in politics; and the violence may continue till there is &s;carcely an individual hardy enough to furni&s;h our managers with a piece. The &s;tate of the &s;tage is at pre&s;ent &s;ufficiently deplorable; and it's litera|ture, in&s;tead of wanton oppo&s;ition, calls loudly for the ge|nerous hand of public encouragement. &mdash; Give it this en|couragement therefore, ye wi&s;e, and ye worthy &mdash; re&s;cue your writers from the wor&s;t of all tyrannies, and no longer form your minds by the &s;entiments of tho&s;e, who are not allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s any minds of their own.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>an Apartment in</HI> Sir JOHN DORMER'S <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Sir JOHN DORMER, Mi&s;s DORMER, and Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL but, my dear Caroline, tho' I grant you that Sir George Ha&s;tings has his peculiarities, &s;till you mu&s;t grant me that he has many very amiable qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never denied Sir George's merit, Sir, but all his good qualities cannot conceal his unaccount|able coxcombry; <Q>his attention is con&s;tantly cen|tered in him&s;elf, and there is no enduring a man who fancies that every woman mu&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight fall violently in love with him.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear her, Mi&s;s Montagu?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="35">
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir John, there is no accounting for in|clination, you know; &mdash; however, I cannot look upon Sir George in the very ridiculous light he appears to Mi&s;s Dormer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No &mdash; why he is a narci&s;&s;us that continually makes love to his own &s;hadow, and I can't bear the idea of a hu&s;band, in who&s;e affection I am likely to be every moment rival'd by the looking|gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay now, my dear, you are rather hard upon him. &mdash; Sir George may po&s;&s;ibly be a little too fond of him&s;elf &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that does'nt prevent him from entertain|ing very tender &s;entiments for Caroline Dormer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may be unnece&s;&s;arily attentive to the niceties of dre&s;s &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then he is attentive to every law of ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if his foibles provoke us to an occa&s;ional &s;mile, his worth mu&s;t always excite our warme&s;t admiratiun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Harriot, a very florid winding up of a period, and very proper for an elevated thought in a &s;entimental Comedy; &mdash; but I tell you, I &s;hould reli&s;h the&s;e encomiums on Sir George well enough, if he Was not &s;o particularly recom|mended
<PB N="3" REF="36">
to my attention. &mdash; I really can't &s;up|port the imagination of vowing honour and obe|dience to the object of my own ridicule, and it wou'd mortify my pride beyond conception, to &s;ee my hu&s;band the con&s;tant je&s;t of his acquaint|ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Caroline, don't be too difficult in your choice, nor entertain any romantic idea of finding a husband, all perfection. &mdash; The expectation of too much before marriage, frequently imbitters the union after; &mdash; and as the be&s;t men will have their little blemi&s;hes, we may farley number tho&s;e among the be&s;t, in who&s;e characters we can di&s;|cover nothing more than a few tri&s;ling peculiarities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee, Sir, you make a point of this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd not make a point of any thing, my dear, which I thought wou'd be in the lea&s;t repug|nant to your happine&s;s: &mdash; but, really, when I con|&s;ider this propo&s;al in every re&s;pect, when I con|&s;ider the rank, the fortune, and what is above all, the merit of the man, I cannot but with that you wou'd give him a favourable reception; and this the more e&s;pecially, as I am convinced, if the match &s;hould take place, that your fine &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s of temper, will ea&s;ily mould your hu&s;|band to your wi&s;h, and quickly remove every trace of tho&s;e foibles, which, are at pre&s;ent the only rea&s;on of your objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very good, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="37">
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This morning, my dear, Sir George purpo&s;es to declare himfelf in form.&mdash;If you can receive his addre&s;&s;es, you will make him happy, and ob|lige me exceedingly; &mdash; but if you cannot, deal ingenuou&s;ly, and reject him; the ju&s;tice which I owe to him, as well as the tenderne&s;s which I have for you, makes this advice doubly recp&s;ite.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT,</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr.Willoughby, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll wait upon him in&s;tantly. <STAGE>[Exit Serv.]</STAGE> Think therefore &s;eriou&s;ly, Caroline, before you deter|mine, for I neither wi&s;h to cheat my friend into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a reluctant heart, nor to &s;acrifice my daughter to the object of her aver&s;ion. <STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Harriot, what &s;hall I do?&mdash;You hear he has actually mention'd him to me in the mo&s;t &s;e|rious terms, and that this very morning he is to make a formal declaration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then, does'nt Sir John de&s;ire you to reject him, if he is really di&s;agreeable? &mdash;Can you po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h for a greater degree of indulgence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet that very indulgence, my dear Mi&s;s Montagu, is likely to render me extremely mi|&s;erable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU</SPEAKER>
<P>Why indeed, Mi&s;s Dormer&mdash; remember, child, you complimented me fir&s;t with the cold re&s;pect|ful
<PB N="5" REF="38">
epithet of Mi&s;s&mdash;the men in general &s;ay that the &s;ure&s;t way of making a woman wretched is to indulge her inclinations&mdash;But pray, my dear, why is this liberty which Sir John allows you, of promoting your own happine&s;s, &s;o very likely to make you mi&s;erable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Harriot! don't you &s;ee that while he is &s;o generou&s;ly anxious to con&s;ult my wi&s;hes, I am bound by gratitude, as well as ju&s;tice, to pay the greate&s;t regard to his expectations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are really an excellent girl, my dear. But pray an&s;wer me one que&s;tion &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGUE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this di&s;like, which you entertain to your fa|ther's choice, entirely the re&s;ult of your aver&s;ion to Sir George? or is it, be hone&s;t now, the con|&s;equence of a &s;ecret partiality for &s;omebody el&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;ecret partiality for &s;omebody el&s;e? Pray, my dear, for whom is it likely I &s;hould entertain a partiality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caroline, Caroline, this re&s;erve is ill &s;uited both to the nature of our friend&s;hip and the cu&s;tom|ary frankne&s;s of your temper&mdash;yet notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecre&s;y you have hitherto &s;o unkindly ob&s;erv'd, I can ea&s;ily &s;ee that Mr. Villars&mdash;What, con|&s;cious, Caroline?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="39">
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Harriot, &s;pare me&mdash;nor be offended that I have endeavour'd to keep a &s;ecret from you, which I ab&s;olutely &s;hudder to whi&s;per to my&s;elf&mdash;to deal candidly, my dear, I mu&s;t acknowledge that your charge is but too ju&s;t&mdash;and notwith&s;tanding every effort of my pride, and every argument of my prudence, I find this humble yet de&s;erving Villars po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a much higher place in my e&s;teem than can be con&s;i&s;tent with my happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to do the young fellow ju&s;tice, he is really very agreeable, and has &s;omething in his manner that would do credit to a more eligible &s;ituation&mdash;but&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Harriot, there's the misfortune&mdash;agreeable as he is in every re&s;pect, he is &s;till a total depen|dent on my father, and thinks him&s;elf extremely happy that his talents have obtain'd him even a temporary e&s;tabli&s;hment in an opulent family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, Sir John is generous, and Mr. Villars is very u&s;eful to him in his literary re|&s;earches; be&s;ides, I am not a little pleas'd at the di&s;tinction with which he, as well as the Captain, con&s;tantly treats Mr. Villars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how it is&mdash;Mr. Villars has a man|ner of commanding re&s;pect from every body; he is humble without &s;ervility, and &s;pirited&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! he is every thing that's amiable, no doubt &mdash;and the &s;tars have been exceedingly relentle&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="40">
in not giving him a large fortune&mdash;however, if I have any &s;kill in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the heart, Villars is to the full as unea&s;y upon your account as you can po&s;&s;ibly be on his&mdash;he is always contriving excu&s;es for conver&s;ing with you, yet when he does, he is in vi&s;ible confu&s;ion; and it was only ye&s;|terday evening, when I beg'd he wou'd put a letter for me into the po&s;t-office, that he &s;tam|mer'd out, in the utmo&s;t perplexity, <Q>I &s;hall take particular care, Madam, to deliver it to Mi&s;s Dormer.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be the ca&s;e, Harriot, I mu&s;t indeed behave with particular circum&s;pection to him; and yet, tho' I &s;ee the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever being his, he has given me an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion to the re&s;t of his &s;ex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then do you intend to do with Sir George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>To reject him; but &s;till to do it without giving any offence to my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you propo&s;e to manage it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>By throwing my&s;elf hone&s;tly upon Sir George's humanity, by telling him my affection is engaged, and by begging of him to withdraw his addre&s;&s;es in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall appear to be the re&s;ult of his own choice, and not the con&s;equence of my di&s;inclination&mdash;Sir George, notwith&s;tanding his egregious vanity is uncommonly good-natur'd &mdash;but let us retire to my room, my dear, I am
<PB N="8" REF="41">
unfit for company at pre&s;ent, and here we are likely to be broken in upon. &mdash;O Harriot.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my brother-in-law elect, &mdash;you are very &s;plendidly dre&s;s'd this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Jack, I think, I do make a pretty to|lerable appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think this appearance calculated to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon a woman of &s;pirit. &mdash; Zounds, man, give up your preten&s;ions, for no|thing but a fellow of life is likely to &s;ucceed with my &s;i&s;ter I can promi&s;e you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fellow of life, Jack; &mdash;that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, a fellow of profligacy: &mdash;truly you pay your &s;i&s;ter a very pretty compliment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why pray do you nece&s;&s;arily connect the idea of life with the idea of profligacy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, in the vocabulary of libertines, like you, Jack, the word life always means a round of every thing that is fooli&s;h or unwarrantable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="42">
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the devil are you turn'd fanatic, George, that you begin to deal &s;o much in &s;econd|hand morality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;hort, your fellows of &s;pirit never allow a man a &s;cruple of common-&s;en&s;e, till he has en|tirely pro&s;tituted his understanding; nor &s;uppo&s;e him to be fit for a commerce with the world, till he ab&s;olutely merits to be hunted out of &s;ociety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, George, there is one exce&s;s of which you your&s;elf have been guilty; and I have known the time, when you took a bottle &s;o freely, that you were generally made toa&s;t-ma&s;ter of the com|pany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I &s;oon found out that drinking was dete&s;table, and toa&s;ting the greate&s;t of all ab&s;ur|dities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how wou'd you wi&s;h to pa&s;s an evening? &mdash; Can any thing exceed the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety, with a few &s;elect friends of good-nature and viva|city?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O nothing to be &s;ure is &s;o delightful as guzzling down half a dozen bottles, and enjoying the ratio|nal di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;of where does the toa&s;t &s;tand&mdash;with you, Sir William&mdash;no, with you, Sir George&mdash; fill him a bumper, Captain Dormer&mdash;fill him to the top. &mdash;O, an evening &s;pent in this manner mu&s;t be delectable, e&s;pecially if a couple of fools should happily quarrel in their cups, and cut one another's throat to prove the &s;uperiority of their under&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="43">
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! &mdash;But was this all your objection to the bottle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, for it made my heach ach, and di&s;order'd my dre&s;s beyond bearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Disorder'd your dre&s;s, ha! ha! ha! what un|accountable coxcombry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be &s;ure it's a very ridiculous thing for a man to &s;hew a little regard for decency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding you are a coxcomb &s;y&s;|tematically, I am &s;ure the character will not be a &s;trong recommendation to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter, Jack, is a woman of &s;en&s;e, and mu&s;t &s;ee that &s;he has a much &s;tronger chance of being happy with me, than poor Mi&s;s Montagu has of being happy with her brother. &mdash;My heart is una|dulterated, and is therefore worth any woman's acceptance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no doubt it is a very valuable acqui&s;ition.</P>

<P>I wonder &s;he does not chu&s;e to follow the &s;en&s;i|ble example you &s;et her, and endeavour rather to le&s;&s;en, than to aggravate the mea&s;ure of unavoid|able misfortunes. &mdash;She's a young woman, and mi&s;anthropy at her age is rather out of character.</P>

<SPEAKER>WILLOUGHBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was'nt her youth, however, that &s;truck me, but the &s;obriety of her conduct, and her affection for my daughter; &mdash;&s;he was be&s;ides a di&s;tant rela|tion of my fir&s;t wife's&mdash;liv'd with us in the &s;ame hou&s;e; and &s;ome how I lik'd her, becau&s;e having no fortune, it gave her but little expectation of a better hu&s;band.</P>

again&s;t the tyranny of fathers who wanted to force the inclinations of their children from de&s;picable motives of intere&s;t&mdash;and curs'd the poor &s;tars for giving her &s;o much beauty, and making me &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it:&mdash; then pre&s;&s;ing her tenderly by the hand, I u&s;ually ran out of the room, as if in vio|lent emotion, affecting to gulp down a torrent of tears, and left her own pity to be my advocate the moment &s;he recovered the u&s;e of her recollection.</P>

<SPEAKER>WILLOUGHBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, madam, young women are apt enough to err of them&s;elves, but a father has indeed a great deal to an&s;wer for, who expo&s;es his daughter to unnece&s;&s;ary temptations &mdash;Captain Dormer has been already too &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;ome families of our acquaintance; and if, while we are contriving to trap him into a marriage with Cornelia, he &s;hould find it po&s;&s;ible to rob her of her honour, we &s;hall be very properly puni&s;hed for the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of our de&s;igns.</P>

<PB N="24" REF="57">
we &s;hould always keep them out of danger; &mdash; but our ridiculous partiality, con&s;tantly paints them in the mo&s;t flattering colours or perfection, and we never &s;uppo&s;e them cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble of committing the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;take, till they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> totally undone.</P>

<P>I can &s;ay nothing to you, Cornelia, but what mu&s;t add to your regret:&mdash; there is no hope of any favourable turn in the affairs of our family: &mdash; day after day produces fre&s;h di&s;appointments; and in&s;tead of having any agreeable pro&s;pect to cheer us as we go on, the view becomes more and more clouded with misfortunes. &mdash;No, there's no enduring life upon the&s;e terms; &mdash; no, there's no po&s;&s;ibility of enduring it.</P>

<P>Ah, my dear child, I know but too well how to pity your di&s;tre&s;s:&mdash; I have been in love my|&s;elf; &s;trangely as he now neglects my advice, I was once very de&s;perately in love with your fa|ther: &mdash; He was the fir&s;t man that ever &s;aid a ten|der thing to me; &mdash;and Mexico, if he was dead to|morrow, would not purcha&s;e a &s;ingle glance of regard for another, nor the mines of Peru obtain a &s;mile of approbation.</P>

<P>Indeed I cannot. &mdash; I only &s;aw her into a coach; but I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is returned to her father's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No &mdash; &s;he is not &mdash; her father is but ju&s;t gone &mdash; he came to me, as I &s;u&s;pected, on the very fir&s;t knowledge of her flight; and &s;hew'd &s;o deep a di&s;tre&s;s, that I cou'dn't per&s;evere in my de&s;ign of &s;eeming wholly ignorant of her elopement.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? is your denouement to be produc'd at my expence; upon my word, I &s;hould be much oblig'd to Sir John's interpo&s;ition for &s;uch a purpo&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hou'd at lea&s;t, Madam &mdash; and though I come rather with an ill grace after &s;o recent a rejection&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DORMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affection is not unadulterated now George</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, no &mdash; But I hav'nt yet told Mi&s;s Mon|tagu &mdash; that death it&s;elf is infinitely preferable to the idea of offending her &mdash; <STAGE>[ludicrou&s;ly]</STAGE> though I wou'd readily ri&s;k my life to purcha&s;e her fa|vourable opinion. <STAGE>[Turning to her.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s MONTAGU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, don't talk to me on this &s;ubject now, Sir George &mdash; You have to be &s;ure merited much &mdash; and you are in every re&s;pect &s;o greatly the oppo|&s;ite of my confident &s;wain there, who thought I mu&s;t fly into his arms the moment he conde&s;cend|ed to receive me &mdash; that &mdash; however, I won't hear a &s;yllable from you now &mdash; if you can make a tollerable bow to me do, but don't let me hear a &s;yllable of non&s;en&s;e, I beg of you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. WILLOUGHBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty fine! is it non&s;en&s;e to make a grateful acknowledgment for the kindne&s;s of a lady &mdash; What will the men come to at la&s;t? &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he thinks, Madam&mdash;Though Villars <STAGE>[A&s;ide to Villars]</STAGE> 'tis a little hard, becau&s;e Mi&s;s Mon|tagu choo&s;es to con&s;ult her own happine&s;s, that I am to acknowledge the receipt of an obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir George, Mi&s;s Montagu has too much di&s;cernment not to &s;ee the value of &s;o de|&s;erving a lover &mdash; Addre&s;s her therefore certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and look &s;ecurely for happine&s;s ac|cording to Mr. Willoughby's principle, becau&s;e you richly merit it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLOUGHBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Sir John &mdash; Providence looks down de|lighted on the actions of the worthy, and, how|ever it may command adver&s;ity to frown on the beginning of their days, they will acknowledge with me, that all it's di&s;pen&s;ations are full of be|nignity in the end.</P>

<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MRS. BARRY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>MODISH divines, at court and in the city,</L>
<L>Are in their pulpits hum'rous, gay, and witty &mdash;</L>
<L>They've now chang'd hands, the &s;tage and pulpit teaching,</L>
<L>Sermons are plays, and plays are merely preaching &mdash;</L>
<L>A Word to the Wi&s;e, <HI>a pretty pert advi&s;er</HI>! &mdash;</L>
<L>As if 'twere po&s;&s;ible to make you wi&s;er:</L>
<L>Yet as each here, may think the Poet labours</L>
<L>Not to teach him, but to in&s;truct his neighbours:</L>
<L>As the bright reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts of that &s;plendid row</L>
<L>Sneer on the pit, for beings much below;</L>
<L>And the&s;e in turn, as things in order move,</L>
<L>To&s;s up the &s;neer to tho&s;e who mount above:</L>
<L>The gods look down, and let <HI>their</HI> pity fall</L>
<L>On front, &s;ide, green, &s;tage-boxes, pit, and all.</L>
<L>Let me, before your carriages appear,</L>
<L>Breathe one &s;hort word, ye wi&s;e ones, in your ear.</L>
<L>You, &s;top your chairs, (<HI>to the &s;ide-boxes</HI>) your hacks, (<HI>to the pit</HI>) won't run away;</L>
<L>And ladies, (<HI>to the gallery</HI>) put not on your pattins pray:</L>
<L>And fir&s;t, ye &s;oft, ye &s;weet romantic maids,</L>
<L>Who die for purling &s;treams, and &s;ylvan &s;hades,</L>
<L>And think for better and for wor&s;e, to take</L>
<L>The be&s;t of hu&s;bands, in a darling rake;</L>
<L>Who brings a &s;hatter'd fortune to the fair,</L>
<L>With mind and body wanting va&s;t repair;</L>
<L><PB REF="134">
Shall I for once your tender thoughts reveal?</L>
<L>'Tis fine to hear him &s;wear, to &s;ee him kneel;</L>
<L>His tongue with worn-out extacies will run,</L>
<L>'Till he has triumph'd, 'till the wife's undone;</L>
<L>And then that tender &s;train, &s;o love-creating,</L>
<L>Turns to, "Death, Madam, hold your cur&s;ed prating, &mdash;</L>
<L>"You quite di&s;tract me &mdash; prithee farther &s;tand &mdash;</L>
<L>"I won't be teaz'd &mdash; Zounds, take away your hand &mdash;"</L>
<L>This is a &s;ad change, ladies, but 'tis common,</L>
<L>Man will be man, and woman will be woman;</L>
<L>For Villars is a phoenix, where's his brother?</L>
<L>'Twill take a hundred years to find another.</L>
<L>Yet you, ye Sires, whom time &s;hould render wi&s;e,</L>
<L>You act as if each moment it could ri&s;e;</L>
<L>Forgetting all, what you your&s;elves have been,</L>
<L>You tru&s;t your girls with Dormers at fifteen;</L>
<L>Throw your poor lambkins in the tyger's way,</L>
<L>Then &s;tare to find a rake &mdash; a bea&s;t of prey.</L>
<L>Learn prudence here &mdash; and, O! you precious blades,</L>
<L>Whether cockaded, or without cockades;</L>
<L>Whether haranguing for the public good,</L>
<L>You &s;hake St. Stephens &mdash; or the Robinhood &mdash;</L>
<L>Who ring our charms for ever in our ears,</L>
<L>Yet inly triumph at a virgin's tears;</L>
<L>Be now convinc'd &mdash; the libertine di&s;claim,</L>
<L>And live to honour, if not dead to &s;hame.</L>
<L>What is the plaudit of a fool when mellow,</L>
<L>Roaring in raptures, <HI>a damn'd hone&s;t fellow</HI>?</L>
<L>Will that repay you for the bo&s;om &s;tings?</L>
<L>Damn'd hone&s;t fellows, <HI>oft are worthle&s;s things</HI> &mdash;</L>
<L>But I'll &s;top here, I will not &s;ermonize &mdash;</L>
<L>A fooli&s;h woman can't in&s;truct the wi&s;e.</L>
