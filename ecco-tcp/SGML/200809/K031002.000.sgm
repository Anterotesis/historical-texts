<HEAD>THE APPRENTICE turned MASTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory left off with the dreadful &s;udden death of Williams the idle Shoemaker, who died in a dunken fit at the Grey|hound. It al&s;o &s;hewed how James Stock, his faithful apprentice, by his hone&s;t and upright be|haviour, &s;o gained the love and re&s;pect of his late ma&s;ter's creditors&punc; that they &s;et him up in bu&s;ine&s;s, though he was not worth a &s;hilling of his own, &s;uch is the power of a good character! And when we la&s;t parted from him he had ju&s;t got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ma&s;ter's &s;hop.</P>
<P>This &s;udden pro&s;perity was a time of trial for James; who, as he was now become a creditable trade&s;man, I &s;hall hereafter think proper to call Mr. James Stock. I &s;ay, this &s;udden ri&s;e in life was a time of trial; for we hardly know what we are our&s;elves till we become our own ma&s;ters. There is indeed always a rea&s;onable hope that a good &s;ervant will not make a bad ma&s;ter, and that a faithful apprentice will prove an hone&s;t trade&s;|man. But the heart of man is deceitful. And &s;ome folks &s;eem to behave very well while they are un|der &s;ubjection; but no &s;ooner do they get a little power than their heads are turned, and they grow prouder than tho&s;e who are gentlemen born. They forget at once that they were lately poor and de|pendent them&s;elves, &s;o that one would think that with their poverty they had lo&s;t their memory too. I have known &s;ome who &s;uffered mo&s;t hard|&s;hips in their early days, the mo&s;t hard and oppre&s;&s;ive in their turn; &s;o that they &s;eem to for|get that fine con&s;iderate rea&s;on which GOD gives
<PB N="3" REF="3">
to the children of I&s;rael why they &s;hould be mer|ciful to their &s;ervants, "remembering" &s;aith he, "that thou thy&s;elf wa&s;t a bondman."</P>
<P>Young Mr. Stock did not &s;o forget him&s;elf. He had indeed the only &s;ure guard from falling into this error. It was not from any ea&s;ine&s;s in his na|tural di&s;po&s;ition: for that only ju&s;t &s;erves to make folks good-natured when they are plea&s;ed, and patient when they have nothing to vex them. James went upon higher ground. He did not give way to abu&s;ive language, becau&s;e he knew it was a &s;in. He did not u&s;e his apprentices ill, becau&s;e he knew he had him&s;elf a ma&s;ter in heaven.</P>
<P>He knew he owed his pre&s;ent happy &s;ituation to the kindne&s;s of the creditors. But did he grow ea&s;y and carele&s;s becau&s;e he knew he had &s;uch friends? No indeed. He worked with double di|ligence in order to get out of debt, and to let the&s;e friends &s;ee he did not abu&s;e their kindne&s;s. Such behaviour as this is the greate&s;t encourage|ment in the world to rich people to lend a little money.</P>
<P>His &s;hoes and boots were made in the be&s;t man|ner, this <HI>got</HI> him bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;et out with a rule to tell no lies and deceive no cu&s;tomers; this <HI>&s;e|cured</HI> his bu&s;ine&s;s. He had two rea&s;ons for not promi&s;ing to &s;end home goods when he knew he &s;hould not be able to keep his word. The fir&s;t, becau&s;e he knew a lie was a &s;in, the next, becau&s;e it was a folly. There is no credit &s;ooner worn out than that which is got by fal&s;e pretences. After a little while no one is deceived by them. Fal&s;e|hood is &s;o &s;oon found out that I believe mo&s;t trade&s;men are the poorer for it in the long run.
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Deceit is the wor&s;t, part of a &s;hopkeeper's &s;tock in trade.</P>
<P>James was now at the head of a family. "This is a &s;erious &s;ituation," (&s;aid he to him&s;elf, one fine &s;ummer's evening, as he &s;tood leaning over the half door of his &s;hop to enjoy a little fre&s;h air) "I am now ma&s;ter of a family. My cares are doubled and &s;o are my duties. I &s;ee the higher one gets in life the more one has to an&s;wer for. Let me now call to mind the &s;orrow I u&s;ed to feel when I was made to carry work home on a Sunday by an ungodly ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>So what his heart found right to do he re&s;olved to do quickly; and he &s;et out at fir&s;t as he meant to go on. The Sunday was truly a day of re&s;t at Mr. Stock's. He would not allow a pair of &s;hoes to be given out on that day to oblige the be&s;t cu&s;|tomer he had. And what did he loo&s;e by it? Why nothing. For when the people were once u&s;ed to it, they liked Saturday night ju&s;t as well. But had it been otherwi&s;e he would have given up his gains to his con&s;cience.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Shewing how Mr. <HI>STOCK</HI> behaved to his <HI>APPRENTICES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>When he got up in the world &s;o far as to have apprentices, he thought him&s;elf as accountable for their behaviour as if they had been his children. He was very kind to them, and had a chearful mer|ry way of talking to them, &s;o that the lads who had &s;een too much of &s;wearing, reprobate ma&s;ters, were very fond of him. They were never afraid of &s;peaking to him, they told him all their little trou|bles, and con&s;idered their ma&s;ter as their be&s;t friend, for they &s;aid they would do any thing for a
<PB N="5" REF="5">
good word and a kind look. As he did not &s;wear at them when they had been guilty of a fault, they did not lie to him to conceal it, and thereby make one fault two. But though he was very kind, he was very watchful al&s;o, for he did not think ne|glect any part of kindne&s;s. He brought them to one very pretty method, which was, of a Sunday evening to divert them&s;elves with writing out half a dozen texts of Scripture in a pretty copy book with gilt covers. You may have the &s;ame at any of the Stationer's; they do not co&s;t above four pence, and will la&s;t nearly a year.</P>
<P>When the boys carried him their books, he ju&s;tly commended him who&s;e texts were written in the faire&s;t hand. "And now my boys," &s;aid he, "let us &s;ee which of you will learn your texts be&s;t in the cour&s;e of the week; he who does &s;hall chu&s;e for next Sunday." Thus the boys &s;oon got many p&s;alms and chapters by heart, almo&s;t without knowing how they came by them. He taught them how to make a practical u&s;e of what they learnt; for," &s;aid he "it will an&s;wer little pur|po&s;e to learn texts if we do not try to live up to them." One of the boys being apt to play in his ab&s;ence, and to run back again to his work when he heard his ma&s;ter's &s;tep, he brought him to a &s;en&s;e of his fault by the la&s;t Sunday's texts, which happened to be 6th of Ephe&s;ians. He &s;hewed him what was meant by being "obedient to his ma&s;ter in &s;inglene&s;s of heart as unto Chri&s;t," and explained to him with &s;o much kindne&s;s what it was, "not to work with eye-&s;ervice as men plea&s;ers, but do|ing the will of God from the heart," that the lad &s;aid he &s;hould never forget it, and it did more to|wards

curing him of idlene&s;s than the &s;ounde&s;t hor&s;e whipping would have done.</P>

<HEAD>How Mr. <HI>STOCK</HI> got out of Debt.</HEAD>
<P>Stock's behaviour was very regular, and he was much beloved for his kind and peaceable temper. He had al&s;o a good reputation for &s;kill in his trade, and his indu&s;try was talked of through the whole town, &s;o that he had &s;oon more work than he could po&s;&s;ibly do. He paid all his dealers to the very day, and took care to carry his intere&s;t money to the creditors the moment it became due. In two or three years he was able to begin to pay off a &s;mall part of the principal. His rea&s;on for being &s;o eager to pay money as &s;oon as it became due was this. He had ob&s;erved trade&s;men, and e&s;pecially his old ma&s;ter, put off the day of pay|ment as long as they could, even though they had the means in their power. This deceived them. For having money in their pockets they forgot it belonged to the creditor, and not to them&s;elves, and &s;o got to fancy they were rich when they were really poor. This fal&s;e notion led them to in|dulge in idle expences, whereas, if they had paid regularly they would have had this one tempta|tion the le&s;s. A young trade&s;man, when he is going to &s;pend money, &s;hould at lea&s;t a&s;k him&s;elf whether this money is his own or his creditors'. This little que&s;tion might help to prevent many a bankruptcy.</P>
<P>A true Chri&s;tian always goes heartily to work to find out what is his be&s;etting &s;in; and when he has found it, (which he ea&s;ily may if he looks &s;harp) again&s;t this &s;in he watches narrowly. Now I know it is the fa&s;hion among &s;ome folks (and a bad fa&s;hion it is) to fancy that good people have
<PB N="7" REF="7">
no &s;in; but this only &s;hews their ignorance. It is not true. That good man St. Paul knew better. And when men do not own their &s;ins, it is not be|cau&s;e there is no &s;in in their hearts, but becau&s;e they are not anxious to &s;earch for it, nor humble to confe&s;s it, nor penitent to mourn over it. But this was not the ca&s;e with James Stock. "Exa|mine your&s;elves truly," &s;aid he, "is no bad part of the catechi&s;m." He began to be afraid that his de&s;ire of living creditably and without being a burthen to any one, might, under the ma&s;k of ho|ne&s;ty and independence lead him into pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s. He feared that the bias of his heart lay that way. So in&s;tead of being proud of his &s;obriety; in&s;tead of bragging that he never &s;pent his money idly, nor went to the alehou&s;e; in&s;tead of boa&s;ting how hard he worked, and how he de|nied him&s;elf, he &s;trove in &s;ecret that even the&s;e good qualities might not grow but of a wrong root. The following event was of u&s;e to him in this way.</P>
<P>One evening as he was &s;tanding at the door of his &s;hop, a poor dirty boy without &s;tockings and &s;hoes came up and a&s;ked him for a bit of broken victuals, for he had eaten nothing all day. In &s;pite of his dirt and rags he was a very pretty, lively, civil &s;poken boy, and Mr. Stock could not help thinking he knew &s;omething of his face. He fetched him out a good piece of bread and chee&s;e, and while the boy was devouring it, a&s;ked him if he had no parents, and why he went about in that vagabond manner? "Daddy has been dead &s;ome years," &s;aid the boy, "he died in a fit over at the Greyhound. Mammy &s;ays he u&s;ed to live at
<PB N="8" REF="8">
this &s;hop, and then we did not want for cloaths nor victuals neither." Stock was melted almo&s;t to tears on finding that this dirty beggar boy was Tommy Williams, the &s;on of his old ma&s;ter. He ble&s;&s;ed God on comparing his own happy condition with that of this poor de&s;titute child, but he was not proud at the compari&s;on, and while he was thankful for his own pro&s;perity, he pitied the help|le&s;s boy.&mdash;"Where have you been living of late," &s;aid he to him? "for I under&s;tood you all went home to your mother's friends." "So we did Sir," &s;aid the boy, "but they are grown tired of maintaining us, becau&s;e they &s;aid that Mammy &s;pent all the money which &s;hould have gone to buy vic|tuals for us, on &s;nuff and drams. And &s;o they have &s;ent us back to this place, which is Daddy's pari&s;h."</P>
<P>"And where do you live here?" &s;aid Mr. Stock. "O Sir, we are all put into the pari&s;h poor-hou&s;e." &mdash;"And does your mother do any thing to help to maintain you?" "No Sir, for Mammy &s;ays &s;he was not brought up to work like poor folks, and &s;he would rather &s;tarve than &s;pin or knit; &s;o &s;he lies a-bed all the morning, and &s;ends us about to pick up what we can, a bit of victuals or a few halfpence." "And have you any money in your pocket now?" "Yes, Sir, I have got three half|pence which I have begged to-day." "Then, as you were &s;o very hungry, how came you not to buy a roll at that baker's over the way?" "Be|cau&s;e, Sir, I was going to lay it out in tea for Mammy, for I never lay out a farthing for my&s;elf. Indeed Mammy &s;ays &s;he will have her tea twice a-day if we beg or &s;tarve for it." "Can you read my boy?" &s;aid Mr. Stock. "A little, Sir, and
<PB N="9" REF="9">
&s;ay my prayers too." "And can you &s;ay your catechi&s;m?" "I have almo&s;t forgot it all, Sir, though I remember about honoring my father and mother, and that makes me &s;till carry the half|pence home to Mammy in&s;tead of buying cakes." "Who taught you the&s;e good things?" "One Jemmy Stock, Sir, who was a pari&s;h 'prentice to my Daddy. He taught me one que&s;tion out of the catechi&s;m every night, and always made me &s;ay my prayers to him before I went to bed. He told me I &s;hould go to the wicked place if I did not fear God, &s;o I am &s;till afraid to tell lies like the other boys. Poor Jemmy gave me a piece of gingerbread every time I learnt well; but I have no friend now; Jemmy was good to me, though Mammy did no|thing but beat him."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock was too much moved to carry on the di&s;cour&s;e, he did not make him&s;elf known to the boy, but took him over to the baker's &s;hop; as they walked along he could not help repeating aloud, a ver&s;e or two of that beautiful hymn, &s;o de&s;ervedly the favourite of all children,
<Q><L>Not more than others I de&s;erve,</L>
<L>Yet God hath given me more;</L>
<L>For I have food while others &s;tarve,</L>
<L>Or beg from door to door.</L></Q></P>
<P>The little boy looked up in his face, &s;aying, "Why Sir, that's the very hymn which Jemmy Stock gave me a penny for learning." Stock made no an&s;wer, but put a couple of three-penny loaves into his hand to carry home, and told him to call on him again at &s;uch a time in the following week.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HEAD>How Mr. <HI>STOCK</HI> continued to be charitable without any Expence.</HEAD>
<P>Stock had abundant &s;ubject for meditation that night. He was puzzled what to do with the boy. While he was carrying on his trade upon borrowed money, he did not think it right to give any part of that money to a&s;&s;i&s;t the idle, or even to help the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "I mu&s;t be ju&s;t," &s;aid he, "before I am generous." Still he could not bear to &s;ee this fine boy given up to certain ruin. He did not think it &s;afe to take him into his &s;hop in his pre&s;ent igno|rant unprincipled &s;tate. At la&s;t he hit upon this thought. I work for my&s;elf twelve hours in the day. Why &s;hall I not work one hour or two for this boy in the evening? It will be but for a year, and I &s;hall then have more right to do what I plea&s;e. My money will then be my own, I &s;hall have paid my debts.</P>
<P>So he began to put his re&s;olution in practice that very night, &s;ticking to his old notion of not putting off till to-morrow what &s;hould be done to-day; and it was thought he owed much of his &s;uc|ce&s;s in life, as well as his growth in goodne&s;s, to this little &s;aying. "I am young and healty," &s;aid he, "one hour's work more will do me no harm; I will &s;et a&s;ide all I get by the&s;e over hours, and put the boy to &s;chool. I have not only no right to puni&s;h this child for the &s;ins of his father, but I con&s;ider that though God hated tho&s;e &s;ins, he has made them be in&s;truments for my advancement."</P>
<P>Tommy Williams called at the time appointed. In the mean time Mr. Stock's maid had made him a tidy little &s;uit of cloaths out of an old coat of her ma&s;ter's. She had al&s;o knit him a pair of
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;tockings, and Mr. Stock made him &s;it down in the &s;hop, while he him&s;elf &s;itted him with a pair of new &s;hoes. The maid having wa&s;hed and dre&s;&s;ed him, Mr. Stock took him by the hand and walked along with him to the pari&s;h poor-hou&s;e to find his mother. They found her dre&s;&s;ed in ragged filthy finery, &s;tanding at the door, where &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed mo&s;t of her time, quarrelling with half a dozen women as idle and dirty as her&s;elf; when &s;he &s;aw Tommy &s;o neat and well dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he fell a-crying for joy. She &s;aid it put her in mind of old times, for Tommy always u&s;ed to be dre&s;&s;ed like a gen|tleman. "So much the wor&s;e," &s;aid Mr. Stock, "if you had not begun by making him look like a gentleman, you needed not have ended by making him look like a beggar." "Oh Jem," &s;aid &s;he, (for though it was four years &s;ince &s;he had &s;een him, &s;he &s;oon recollected him) "fine times for you! &s;et a beggar on hor&s;eback &mdash; you know the proverb. I &s;hall beat Tommy well for finding you out, and expo&s;ing me to you."</P>
<P>In&s;tead of entering into any di&s;pute with this bad woman, or prai&s;ing him&s;elf at her expence; or putting her in mind of her pa&s;t ill behaviour to him; or reproaching her with the bad u&s;e &s;he had made of her pro&s;perity, he mildly &s;aid to her, "Mrs. Williams I am &s;orry for your misfortunes; I am come to relieve you of part of your burthen. I will take Tommy off your hands. I will give him a year's board and &s;chooling, and by that time I &s;hall &s;ee what he is fit for. I will promi&s;e nothing, but if the boy turns out well I will never for&s;ake him. I &s;hall make but one bargain with you, which is, that he mu&s;t not come to this place to hear all this railing and &s;wearing, nor &s;hall he
<PB N="12" REF="12">
keep company with the&s;e pilfering idle children. You are welcome to go and &s;ee him when you plea&s;e, but here he mu&s;t, not come."</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h woman bur&s;t out a crying, &s;aying, "&s;he &s;hould lo&s;e her poor dear Tommy for ever. Mr. Stock might give <HI>her</HI> the money he intended to pay at the &s;chool, for nobody could do &s;o well by him as his own mother." The truth was, &s;he wanted to get the&s;e new cloaths into her clutches, which would all have been pawned at the dram &s;hop before the week was out. This Mr. Stock well knew. From crying &s;he fell to &s;colding and &s;wearing. She told him he was an unnatural wretch, that wanted to make a child de&s;pi&s;e his own mother becau&s;e &s;he was poor. She even went &s;o far as to &s;ay &s;he would not part from him; &s;he &s;aid &s;he hated your godly people, they had no bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, but tried to &s;et men, women, and chil|dren again&s;t their own fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock now almo&s;t lo&s;t his patience, and for one moment a thought came acro&s;s him to &s;trip the boy, carry back the cloaths, and leave him to his unpitiful mother. "Why, &s;aid he, &s;hould I work over hours, and wear out my &s;trength for this wicked woman?" But he &s;oon checked this thought, by reflecting on the patience and long-&s;uffering of God with rebellious &s;inners. This cured his anger in a moment, and he mildly rea|&s;oned with her on her folly and blindne&s;s in op|po&s;ing the good of her child.</P>
<P>One of the neighbours who &s;tood by, &s;aid, what a fine thing it was for the boy, but &s;ome people were born to be lucky! She wi&s;hed Mr. Stock would take a fancy to her child, he &s;hould have him &s;oon enough. Mrs. Williams now began to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="13" REF="13">
frightened le&s;t Mr. Stock &s;hould take the woman at her word, and &s;ullenly con&s;ented to let the boy go, from envy and malice, not from prudence and gratitude; and Tommy was &s;ent to &s;chool that very night, his mother crying and roaring, in&s;tead of thanking God for &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear telling a very good-natured thing of Will Simp&s;on, one of the work|men. By the bye it; was that very young fellow who was reformed by Stock's good example when he was an apprentice, and who u&s;ed to &s;ing P&s;alms with him on a Sunday evening when they got out of the way of Williams's junketting. Will coming home early one evening was &s;urpri&s;ed to find his ma&s;ter at work by him&s;elf, long after the u&s;ual time. He begged &s;o heartily to know the rea&s;on, that Stock owned the truth. Will was &s;o &s;truck with this piece of kindne&s;s, that he &s;natched up a la&s;t, crying out, "Well ma&s;ter, you &s;hall not work by your&s;elf however; we will go &s;nacks in maintaining Tommy: it &s;hall never be &s;aid that Will Simp&s;on was idling about, when his ma&s;ter was working for charity. This made the hours pa&s;s chearfully and doubled the profits.</P>
<P>In a year or two Mr. Stock&punc; by God's ble&s;|&s;ing on his labours, become quite clear of the world. He now paid off his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> he never forgot his obligation to them, and found many opportu|nities of &s;hewing kindne&s;s to them, and to their children after them. He now ca&s;t about for a pro|per wife, and as he was thought a pro&s;per us man, and very well looking be&s;ides, mo&s;t of the &s;mart girls of the place with their tawdry finery, u&s;ed to be often parading before the &s;hop, and would even go to church in order to put them&s;elves in
<PB N="14" REF="14">
his way. But Mr. Stock when he went to church had other things in his head, and if ever he thought about the&s;e gay dam&s;els at all, it was with concern at &s;eeing them &s;o improperly tricked out, &s;o that the very means they took to plea&s;e him, made him di&s;like them.</P>
<P>There was one Bet&s;y We&s;t, a young woman of excellent character and very mode&s;t appearance. He had &s;eldom &s;een her out, as &s;he was employed night and day in waiting on an aged widowed mo|ther who was both lame and blind. This good girl was indeed almo&s;t truly eyes and feet to her helple&s;s parent, and Mr. Stock u&s;ed to &s;ee her through the little ca&s;ement window lifting her up and feeding her with a tenderne&s;s which greatly rai&s;ed his e&s;teem for her. He u&s;ed to tell Will Simp&s;on, as they &s;at at work, that &s;uch a duti|ful daughter could hardly fail to make a faithful wife. He had not, however, the heart to try to draw her off from her care of her &s;ick mother. The poor woman declined very fa&s;t. Bet&s;y was much employed in reading or praying by her while &s;he was awake, and pa&s;&s;ed good part of the night while &s;he &s;lept, in doing &s;ome fine works to &s;ell in order to &s;upply her &s;ick mother with little nice|ties which their poor pittance could not afford, while &s;he her&s;elf lived on a cru&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock knew that Bet&s;y would have little or nothing after her mother's death, as &s;he had only a life income. On the other hand Mr. Thomp&s;on, the Tanner, had offered him 200l. with his daugh|ter Nancy. But he was almo&s;t &s;orry that he had not in this ca&s;e an opportunity of re&s;i&s;ting his natural bias, which rather lay on the &s;ide of loving money: "For," &s;aid he,
<Q>putting principle and putting

affection out of the que&s;tion, I &s;hall do a more <HI>prudent</HI> thing by marrying Bet&s;y We&s;t, who will conform to her &s;tation, and is a religious, hum|ble indu&s;trious girl, without a &s;hilling, than by having an idle dre&s;&s;y la&s;s, who will neglect my family and fill my hou&s;e with company, though &s;he &s;hould have twice the fortune which Nancy Thomp&s;on would bring.</Q></P>
<P>At length poor old Mrs. We&s;t was relea&s;ed from all her &s;ufferings. At a proper time Mr. Stock pro|po&s;ed marriage to Bet&s;y, and was accepted. All the di&s;appointed girls in the town wondered what any body could like in &s;uch a dowdy as that. Had the man no eyes? They thought Mr. Stock had had more ta&s;te. Oh! how it did provoke all the vain idle things to find, that &s;taying at home, dre&s;&s;ing plainly, &s;erving God, and nur&s;ing a blind Mother, &s;hould do that for Bet&s;y We&s;t which all their con|trivances, flaunting, and dancing could not do for them.</P>
<P>He was not di&s;appointed of meeting with a good wi&s;e in Bet&s;y, as indeed tho&s;e who marry on right grounds &s;eldom are. But if religious per&s;ons will chu&s;e partners for life who have no religion, do not let them complain that they are unhap|py; they might have known that beforehand. Tommy Williams was now taken home to Stock|hou&s;e and bound apprentice. He was always kind and attentive to his mother; and every penny which Will Simp&s;on or his ma&s;ter gave him for learning a chapter he would &s;ave to buy a bit of tea and &s;ugar for her. When the other boys laugh|ed at him for being &s;o fooli&s;h as to deny him&s;elf cakes and apples to give his money to her who was

&s;o bad a woman, he would an&s;wer, "it may be &s;o, but &s;he is my mother for all that."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock was much moved at the change in this boy, who turned out a very good youth. He re|&s;olved, as GOD &s;hould pro&s;per him, that he would try to &s;natch other helple&s;s creatures from &s;in and ruin. "For," &s;aid he, "it is owing to God's ble&s;&s;ing on the in&s;tructions of my good mini&s;ter when I was a child, that I have been &s;aved from the broad way of de&s;truction. He &s;till gave God the glory of every thing he did aright, and when Will Simp|&s;on one day &s;aid to him, "Ma&s;ter, I wi&s;h I were half as good as you are." "William," an&s;wered he gravely, "I once read in a book, that the Devil is willing enough we &s;hould appear to do good actions if he can but make us proud of them."</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not forget our other old acquain|tance, Mr. Stock's fellow 'prentice. So next month you may expect a full account of the many tricks and frolicks of idle Jack Brown, being the third part of the Hi&s;tory of the Two Shoemakers.</P>
