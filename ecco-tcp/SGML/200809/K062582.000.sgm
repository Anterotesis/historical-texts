<P>THIS <HI>Poem</HI> has received, and in my Opinion, very ju&s;tly, uni|ver&s;al Applau&s;e; being look'd on as the mo&s;t perfect <HI>Tragedy</HI> that has been wrote in this Age. The <HI>Fable,</HI> as far as I can judge at fir&s;t Sight, is a very artful and ma&s;terly Contrivance; the <HI>Characters</HI> are well cho&s;en and well

delineated; that of ZARA is admi|rable. The <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are well touch'd, and skilfully wrought up. The <HI>Diction,</HI> proper, clear, beautiful, noble, and di|ver&s;ified agreeably to the Variety of the Subject. <HI>Vice,</HI> as it ought to be, is puni&s;h'd; and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed-Innocence</HI> at la&s;t rewarded. <HI>Nature</HI> appears very hap|pily imitated (excepting one or two doubtful In&s;tances) thro' the whole Piece; in which there are no immode&s;t Images or Expre&s;&s;ions; no wild un|natural Rants, but (&s;ome Exceptions being allowed) all Things are cha&s;te, ju&s;t, and decent.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tragedy,</HI> as I &s;aid before, has mightily obtained, and that without the unnatural and fooli&s;h Mixture of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Buffoonery;</HI> without &s;o much as a <HI>Song,</HI> or a <HI>Dance,</HI> to make it

more agreeable. By this it appears, that as a &s;ufficient Genius can recom|mend it&s;elf, and furni&s;h out abundant Matter of Plea&s;ure and Admiration, without the paultry Helps above named; &s;o likewi&s;e, that the Ta&s;te of the Nation is not &s;o far deprav'd, but that a regular and cha&s;te Play will not only be forgiven, but highly ap|plauded.</P>
