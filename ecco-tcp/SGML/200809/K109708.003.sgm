<HEAD>Fable of the <HI>TWO GENTLEMEN</HI> of <HI>VERONA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_VALENTINE, a young Gen|tleman of <HI>Verona,</HI> is &s;ent by his Father to travel; he goes to <HI>Milan</HI> to attend the Emperor, and falls&punc; in love with <HI>Silvia,</HI> Daughter to the Duke of that Place: &s;he returns his Affection with equal Ardour, but being promi&s;ed by her Father to <HI>Thurio,</HI> a Man whom &s;he hates, they are obliged to keep their mutual Pa&s;&s;ion &s;ecret.</P>
<P><HI>Protheus,</HI> the Friend of <HI>Valentine,</HI> remains at <HI>Ver&oacute;na,</HI> courting <HI>Julia,</HI> a Lady with whom he had been long enamoured; ju&s;t as he had obtained her Promi&s;e to reward his Love, his
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Father &s;ends him likewi&s;e to the Emperor's Court: he parts with <HI>Julia</HI> with many Pro|te&s;tations of eternal Con&s;tancy; but, at his Ar|rival at <HI>Milan,</HI> being introduced by his Friend <HI>Valentine</HI> to <HI>Sylvia,</HI> he forgets <HI>Julia,</HI> falls pa&s;|&s;ionately in love with that Lady, and re&s;olves to gain her for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting this Treachery in his Friend, acquaints him with the Hi&s;tory of his Love, and begs his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;tealing away the Lady, who had con&s;ented to marry him privately that Night.</P>
<P><HI>Protheus</HI> promi&s;es to &s;erve him, but pre|tending Bu&s;ine&s;s to avoid him, goes to the Duke, to whom he relates all that his Friend had ju&s;t before intru&s;ted him with. The Duke in a Rage confines his Daughter in a Tower, and bani&s;hes <HI>Valentin&eacute;</HI> from <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Protheus</HI> he employs to plead for <HI>Thurio</HI> to his Daughter, who by that Means getting Acce&s;s to her, declares his own Pa&s;&s;ion, and is repul&s;ed with Di&s;dain.</P>
<P><HI>Julia,</HI> ignorant of her Lover's Fal&s;hood, and impatient of his Ab&s;ence, di&s;gui&s;es her&s;elf in the Habit of a Page, and travels to <HI>Milan</HI>; there &s;he lodges at the &s;ame Inn where her Lover does, and is informed by the Ho&s;t that <HI>Protheus</HI> was in love with the Duke's Daughter, to whom that Night, in <HI>Thurio</HI>'s Name, he gives a Serenade.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"><HI>Julia</HI> is pre&s;ent at the Mu&s;ic, which being over, <HI>Protheus</HI> entertains <HI>Sylvia</HI> with his Pa&s;&s;ion, in the hearing of his di&s;gui&s;ed Mi&s;tre&s;s, who retires to her Inn in great Di&s;content, where <HI>Protheus</HI> coming &s;oon after, &s;ees her, and not knowing her, hires her for his Page.</P>
<P><HI>Valentine</HI> in his Journey to Mantua, is &s;eized in a Fore&s;t by &s;ome Out-laws, who make him their King.</P>
<P><HI>Silvia</HI> having contrived to e&s;cape out of her Tower, follows her Lover, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Fore&s;t, is taken by tho&s;e Out-laws: the Duke, <HI>Protheus</HI> and <HI>Thurio</HI> follow her, and <HI>Julia Protheus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Protheus</HI> finding her in the Hands of the&s;e Ruffians, who were going to offer her Vio|lence, re&s;cues her, but his Service being ill re|ceived, and his Love ab&s;olutely denied, he threat|ens her with Force likewi&s;e. This happening near <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Cave, who, un&s;een, had been a Witne&s;s of his Friend's Treachery, he ru&s;hes out, delivers <HI>Silvia,</HI> and making him&s;elf known, pa&s;&s;ionately upbraids <HI>Protheus</HI> with his Ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Protheus,</HI> &s;truck with Remor&s;e and Shame, acknowledges his Guilt, profe&s;&s;es his Repent|ance, and implores of his Friend Pardon. <HI>Va|lentine</HI> readily grants it, and as a Proof of his &s;incere Reconcilement, offers to re&s;ign <HI>Silvia</HI> to him; the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Julia</HI> being pre&s;ent at this De|claration,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&s;woons away; recovering, makes her&s;elf-known, and <HI>Protheus</HI> reconciles him&s;elf to her. The Out-laws bring in the Duke and <HI>Thurio,</HI> whom they had taken Pri&s;oners; <HI>Valentine</HI> relea&s;es the Duke, but &s;eeing Thurio about to &s;eize <HI>Silvia</HI>; whom he calls his own&punc; he threatens him with in&s;tant Death if he does not re&s;ign his Preten&s;ions. <HI>Thurio</HI> yields her with Contempt, which &s;o di&s;plea&s;es the Duke, who declares he is charmed with the Spi|rit and Con&s;tancy of <HI>Valentine,</HI> that he be|&s;tows her upon him, and pardoning the Out-laws at his Reque&s;t, they all return to <HI>Milan,</HI> to celebrate the double Nuptials.</P>
<P>Part of the Plot of this Play is taken, from the Story of <HI>Feli&s;mena,</HI> in the Second Book of the <HI>Diana</HI> of <HI>George Montemayor,</HI> a Pa&s;toral Romance, tran&s;lated from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s time; the Loves of <HI>Protheus</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> in the Play their Characters and Adventures are the &s;ame, with tho&s;e of <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Feli&s;mena</HI> in this Romance, who&s;e Hi&s;tory is thus in|troduced.</P>
<P>Three Nymphs dedicated to the Service of <HI>Diana,</HI> &s;traying too far from the Temple of that Godde&s;s, in which they re&s;ided, are met in the Woods by as many &s;avage Men, who, &s;truck with their Beauty, attempted to carry them away by force: their Cries drew a young Shepherde&s;s to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who being armed with a Bow and Quiver, &s;hot her Ar|rows &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully at the Ravi&s;hers, that, in a few Moments, &s;he laid them all breathle&s;s at
<PB N="5" REF="8">
her Feet, and delivered the Nymphs from the Danger that threatened them. Her uncommon Beauty, the Dignity of her Mien, but above all, her &s;urpri&s;ing Valour, per&s;uaded the Nymphs &s;he was &s;ome Godde&s;s, who had de&s;cended from Heaven to &s;ave them from Di&s;honour.</P>
<P>Full of this Idea they threw them&s;elves at her Feet, and, addre&s;&s;ing her as a Divinity, return Thanks for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had vouch|&s;afed them. The Shepherde&s;s rai&s;ing them from the Ground, a&s;&s;ured them with Tears, that &s;he was no Godde&s;s, but a mere Wo|man, and one of the weake&s;t of her Sex, undone by Love, and &s;inking under the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t cruel Fortune.</P>
<P>The Nymphs, moved by Compa&s;&s;ion, and a grateful Sen&s;e of the Obligation they owed her, endeavoured to &s;ooth her &s;orrow, pre&s;&s;ed her to relate her Story, and promi&s;ed her their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Shepherde&s;s being willing to gratify their friendly Curio&s;ity, they &s;eated them&s;elves on the Banks of a Rivulet that ran murmuring by them, when &s;he thus began her Story.</P>
<P>"Know, fair Nymphs of the cha&s;te God|de&s;s, that my native Country is <HI>Vandalia,</HI> a Province not far hence; my Father <HI>Andro|nius,</HI> eminent for his Birth, his Riches, and above all, for the native Sweetne&s;s and Integri|ty of his Manners, was married very young to a Lady named <HI>Delia,</HI> with whom he was pa&s;&s;ionately in love.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">Many Years elap&s;ed, before it plea&s;ed the Gods to ble&s;s them with a Child; at length my Mother conceived in her old Age, and one Night, during her Pregnancy, being di&s;|compo&s;ed with unea&s;y Apprehen&s;ions, and un|able to &s;leep, &s;he de&s;ired my Father to di&s;&s;i|pate her Anxiety by reading &s;ome amu&s;ing Story to her. My Father complied, and read <HI>The Judgment of</HI> Paris.</P>
<P>My Mother taking Occa&s;ion to moralize on this Story, condemned the Partiality of the Shepherd's Sentence. <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, being intoxicated with a &s;en&s;ual Pa&s;&s;ion for Beauty, was incapable of con&s;idering, as he ought, the nobler Qualities of the Mind; heroic Virtue is the brighte&s;t of them all, and therefore the Godde&s;s of Battles merited his Preference.</P>
<P>The Contention was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t for the Prize of Virtue, but Beauty, replied my Father; the Apple was to be given to the faire&s;t; ju&s;tly then did <HI>Paris</HI> be&s;tow it upon <HI>Venus,</HI> who&s;e Charms were &s;o greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of her Competitors.</P>
<P>The Apple was indeed in&s;cribed to the faire&s;t, an&s;wered my Mother, but that was not to be under&s;tood of corporeal, but intellectual Beauty, Fortitude being one of the chiefe&s;t Virtues of the Mind, and the Exerci&s;e of Arms, an exterior Act of this Virtue; had <HI>Paris</HI> been a wi&s;e and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Judge, he would have given the Apple to the Godde&s;s of Battles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">This Controver&s;y la&s;ted &s;o long, that my Mother being fatigued with talking, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. When, lo, the Godde&s;s <HI>Venus</HI> appear|ed to her in a Dream, &s;hining with cele&s;tial Charms; her Eyes expre&s;&s;ed a certain Kind of amiable Severity; for Anger could have no dwelling on the Face of this charming Di|vinity, and with a Voice, maje&s;tically &s;weet, &s;he thus acco&s;ted her.</P>
<P>Whence <HI>Delia</HI> is this Contempt of a Power, who has been always favourable to thee? Ha&s;t thou forgot the Time when thy &s;oft Heart fir&s;t glowed with tender Fires for thy <HI>Andronius?</HI> then did&s;t thou &s;eek my Al|tars; then did&s;t thou implore my Aid; I heard, and granted all thy De&s;ires; and is it thus thou repaye&s;t me? but know, ungrateful Wo|man, thou &s;halt not e&s;cape the Vengeance of an affronted Deity; thou &s;halt bring forth a Son and Daughter, but thou &s;halt not live to ta&s;te the Joys of a Mother; the Moment of their Birth &s;hall be the la&s;t of thy Life; nor &s;hall my Vengeance &s;top here; thy wretched Offspring &s;hall feel the Fury of my ju&s;t Re|&s;entment; they both &s;hall langui&s;h with the Pangs of hopele&s;s Love, and be the Victims of that Power thou ha&s;t dared to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Godde&s;s ended, and vani&s;hed from her Sight, when immediately the heavenly Form of <HI>Jove's</HI> own Daughter, the Divine <HI>Minerva,</HI> appeared before her, awfully &s;weet &s;he &s;miled, and with a grave, but melodious Accent, thus &s;poke to her:</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">The Godde&s;s <HI>Pallas</HI> thanks thee, <HI>Delia,</HI> for the Concern thou ha&s;t expre&s;&s;ed for her Honour, and, as a Reward, &s;he promi&s;es thee to make thy Son and Daughter &s;o powerful in Arms, that their Valour &s;hall be the Won|der of their own, and the Admiration of all future Ages."</P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he di&s;appeared, and my Mo|ther trembling with holy Awe, awaked.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a Month after, &s;he was de|livered of me and a Twin-Brother, and, as the Godde&s;s threatened, died immediately. My Father &s;inking under an Exce&s;s of Sorrow for her Lo&s;s, followed her in a few Months, leaving my Infant-Brother and my&s;elf to the Care of an Aunt, who was Abbe&s;s of a Nun|nery; with her we lived 'till we were twelve Years old, at which Age my Brother was car|ried to the Court of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> where, in a few Years, the heroic Actions he performed in War, gained him an immortal Glory, which yet was not &s;ufficient to com|pen&s;ate for the Pains he has endured in Love.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I was removed from the Nunnery to the Hou&s;e of my Grandmother, under who&s;e Care I had hardly reached my &s;eventeenth Year, ere I was &s;een, and to my Misfortune, loved by the ungrateful <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P>This young Nobleman having beheld me walking on a Terras, which was behind my
<PB N="9" REF="12">
Grandmother's Hou&s;e, and not far di&s;tant from his, he took all Opportunities to make his Pa&s;&s;ion known to me by ardent Looks, which I not &s;eeming to under&s;tand, he deter|mined to write to me, and practi&s;ed &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully upon the ea&s;y yielding Temper of one of my Maids, named <HI>Ro&s;ina,</HI> that &s;he under|took to deliver his Letter to me.</P>
<P>The crafty Wench made u&s;e of a thou|&s;and little Artifices to induce me to receive this Letter, and though I was not di&s;plea&s;ed with her Importunities, yet a&s;&s;uming a Coun|tenance as angry as I was able, I told her &s;ternly, that were I not re&s;trained by a Sen&s;e of what I owed my own Rank, and the Fear of the World's Cen&s;ure, I would di&s;mi&s;s her from my Service, with the Infamy her Pre|&s;umption merited.</P>
<P>Methinks I have the artful Girl this Mo|ment before my Eyes, cunningly di&s;&s;embling the Grief and Confu&s;ion my Anger gave her with a counterfeited Smile.</P>
<P>Believe me, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I meant no more by pre&s;&s;ing you to take this Letter, than to make you laugh. I did not imagine you would be offended, but &s;ince, contrary to my Expectations, I find you are, I will trouble you no more on this Subject; &s;aying this, &s;he put the Letter again into her Pocket, and quit|ted my Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">Ah, how eagerly did my &s;training By pur&s;ue her Steps! I died with de&s;ire to &s;ee the Letter; but Pride and Mode&s;ty, that made me refu&s;e it when &s;he intreated me, now joined with Shame to keep me from requiring it after the Anger I had affected.</P>
<P>All that Day I continued pen&s;ive and un|ea&s;y; at Night, when <HI>Ro&s;ina</HI> attended me in my Chamber, I waited with an anxious Im|patience for a Renewal of that Di&s;cour&s;e with which I had &s;eemed &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed in the Morning; but alas, I was di&s;appointed, <HI>Ro|&s;ina</HI> either was, or appeared re&s;olved to mention the Letter no more. Yet to try if &s;he would fa&s;ten upon any Occa&s;ion to offer it me again:</P>
<P>And is it really &s;o, <HI>Ro&s;ina,</HI> &s;aid I, that Don <HI>Felix,</HI> without having any Regard to my Honour, dare pre&s;ume to write to me?</P>
<P>"Alas, Madam, &s;aid &s;he demurely, the&s;e Things will happen to young Ladies &s;o love|ly as you; I am indeed concerned to find I have offended you by &s;olliciting you to take his Letter, but it was occa&s;ioned by my Igno|rance of your Severity in the&s;e Matters; but I be&s;eech you pardon me, for from this Moment I will never mention it to you again.</P>
<P>This Steadine&s;s cruelly mortified me, yet did I di&s;&s;emble my Unea&s;ine&s;s while &s;he was pre&s;ent; that Night &s;eemed twice as long as u&s;ual; full of a Thou&s;and perplexing Thoughts I waited anxiou&s;ly for Day, without once clo&s;e|ing
<PB N="11" REF="14">
my Eyes. At length the Morning came, and <HI>Ro&s;ina,</HI> at her accu&s;tomed Hour, attending me at my Toilet, let fall the Letter near me, and, as I thought, on Purpo&s;e; which when I perceived, what is that you have dropt? &s;aid I, &s;he an&s;wered, "it was nothing;" but I in&s;i&s;t|ed upon &s;eeing what had fallen.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, why &s;hould you be &s;o de&s;irous to &s;ee it? it is the Letter I would have given you Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I don't believe you, an&s;wered I, therefore give it me that I may convict you of a Fal&s;|hood; immediately &s;he put it into my Hands, a&s;&s;uring me, with an Emotion I knew to be feigned, that it was no other.</P>
<P>You deceive me, cried I, &s;till di&s;&s;em|bling, it is a Letter to your&s;elf, from one of your Lovers, and I am re&s;olved to read it, that I may judge if he de&s;erves your Favour; &s;aying this, I opened the Letter, which, as I expected, was addre&s;&s;ed from Don <HI>Felix</HI> to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The tender and pa&s;&s;ionate Sentiments it contained, &s;o wrought upon the native Soft|ne&s;s of my Temper, that I could not re&s;i&s;t the De&s;ire I felt to return an An&s;wer to it, that might give him Hopes of my future Fa|vour. I now a&s;ked Forgivene&s;s of my Maid, for the Severity I had a&s;&s;umed, and wholly con&s;iding in her Truth and Affection, I com|municated the Contents of Don <HI>Felix</HI>'s Letter
<PB N="12" REF="15">
to her, and begged her A&s;&s;i&s;tance in conveying one to him: this &s;he readily promi&s;ed, and as faithfully performed.</P>
<P>My Letter being calculated to give him Hope, rather than De&s;pair, my Lover omitted nothing that might contribute towards &s;ettling me in a firm Opinion of his Pa&s;&s;ion; every Day brought me a Letter, or &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate Ver&s;es; every Evening a Serenade under my Chamber Window. A whole Year rolled away in this Manner: at length being firmly per|&s;uaded of the Truth and Ardency of his Af|fection, I re&s;olved to make my&s;elf by Promi&s;e hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when (oh! my adver&s;e Fortune!) the Fa|ther of Don <HI>Felix,</HI> having received &s;ome Intima|tion of his Son's Pa&s;&s;ion for me, to prevent his marrying me, as he apprehended, &s;ent him a|way immediately to the Court of the Great Prince&s;s <HI>Augu&s;ta Cae&s;arina,</HI> telling him, it was not fit a young Gentleman of his noble Ex|traction, &s;hould &s;pend his Youth at Home, where Idlene&s;s, and the Force of bad Exam|ples might draw him into dangerous Vices.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Felix</HI> could not re&s;olve to acquaint me with this cruel News, apprehen&s;ive that my extream Grief upon bearing it, would affect him too deeply, he departed without tak|ing leave.</P>
<P>Ah, cha&s;te and lovely Nymphs! how &s;hall I give you an Idea of the Pangs I &s;uffered in his Ab&s;ence! Strangers as ye are to the &s;ort Tyranny of Love, how &s;hall I make you
<PB N="13" REF="16">
comprehend the Torments divided Lovers feel? I found them &s;o in&s;upportable, that for|getting what I owed my Sex, my Rank, and Fame, I quitted my Grandmother's Hou&s;e, and in the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Page, travelled to that Court, where the dear Object of all my Wi&s;hes was.</P>
<P>I was twenty Days in performing this journey, during which time my Di&s;gui&s;e ex|po&s;ed me to great Inconveniences; but my eager De&s;ire to &s;ee Don <HI>Felix,</HI> made me de|&s;pi&s;e them all. At my Arrival I hired a Lodg|ing in a Street le&s;s frequented than any other with Company. My anxious Impatience to &s;ee Don Felix, left me not room for any other Thoughts, but how to gratify this Wi&s;h; yet I dur&s;t not enquire for him of my Ho&s;t, le&s;t my Flight being noi&s;ed abroad, my Sex and Condition might have been &s;u&s;pected; nor did I think it prudent to venture out to &s;eek him, for fear I &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>All Day I pa&s;&s;ed in this Perplexity; at length the Night approached, and brought with it an Increa&s;e of my Affliction, notwith|&s;tanding the Fatigue both of Body and Mind which I had endured, yet I could take no Re|po&s;e; I to&s;&s;ed and tumbled on my unea&s;y Bed 'till Midnight, when my Ho&s;t knocking at my Chamber Door, told me, if I had any Inclina|tion to hear &s;ome fine Mu&s;ic, I had nothing to do but to ri&s;e and open the Window that lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d towards t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Street. Ah me! in the di&s;tracted State my Mind was then in, I was
<PB N="14" REF="17">
little capable of reli&s;hing Mu&s;ic, however charming it might be; yet did I ri&s;e without thinking on what I was doing, and opening the Window, my Attention was immediately engaged by the Sound of a Voice that &s;eemed familiar to my Ears; and li&s;tening eagerly, I perceived it was <HI>Fabius,</HI> a Page belonging to Don <HI>Felix,</HI> who calling to &s;ome Per&s;ons at a little Di&s;tance, &s;aid, now, my Ma&s;ters, it is time to begin, for the Lady is come into the Gal|lery this Moment.</P>
<P>Then immediately they began to play upon &s;everal In&s;truments, which, had I not been racked with a thou&s;and various Thoughts, might with the cele&s;tial Harmony they made, have charmed me into an Exta&s;y.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;ic no &s;ooner cea&s;ed, than a Voice, which, by its ravi&s;hing Sweetne&s;s, I knew to be Don <HI>Felix</HI>'s, &s;ung &s;ome tender and pa&s;&s;ionate Ver&s;es, in which he complained of the extream Rigour of a Lady to whom he had devoted his Affections.</P>
<P>That well known Voice lulled me into &s;uch a &s;weet Delirium of Joy, that forgetting tho&s;e fatal Ver&s;es were addre&s;&s;ed to another, the Image of our pa&s;t Loves ro&s;e fre&s;h to my Remembrance, and my deceitful Imagination repre&s;ented my Lover as formerly, breathing out tho&s;e melting Sounds to me: but this plea&s;ing Delu&s;ion la&s;ted not long; I &s;oon recovered to a Sen&s;e, a bitter Sen&s;e of my deplorable Condi|tion, and turning to my Ho&s;t, I a&s;ked him
<PB N="15" REF="18">
with a Sigh, that &s;hook my whole Frame, if he knew the Lady for who&s;e Sake that Mu&s;ic was performed.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, he did not, for there were &s;o many fair and noble Ladies lived in that Street, that it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover to which of them it was addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Finding he could not &s;atisfy me in this particular, I lent my whole Attention again to the Voice of my unfaithful Lover, but ah! with different Sen&s;ations; for now my Soul was filled with the mo&s;t gloomy De&s;pair. The Morning dawn'd before this hateful Serenade was ended; I withdrew again to my Bed, and with a River of Tears bewailed my own Misfor|tune, and the Incon&s;tancy of Don <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P>Great Part of the Day being wa&s;ted in this Manner, I ro&s;e, and putting on my Di&s;|gui&s;e, went out of my Lodging, wandering thro' the Streets, without any determined De&s;ign, yet anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hing to &s;ee my perjured Lover.</P>
<P>Chance brought me to the Gates of the Palace; I entered a broad paved Court that was before it, and beheld a great many La|dies, young, beautiful, and richly adorned, &s;hewing them&s;elves at the Windows to the young Noblemen, who were riding backwards and forwards below, and who&s;e Eyes were differently directed, as the Objects of their De&s;ires were placed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">While I continued &s;tanding near the Pa|lace-Gate in hopes of &s;eeing Don <HI>Felix,</HI> who&s;e new Mi&s;tre&s;s I did not doubt was among&s;t the Ladies there, I &s;aw <HI>Fabius</HI> approach, and after &s;peaking a few Words to the Porter that kept the &s;econd Entry, return, the &s;ame Way he came; my Heart beat with eager Expecta|tion; I imagined Don <HI>Felix</HI> was coming; I was not deceived, he came attended with &s;e|veral Servants, all dre&s;&s;ed in rich Liveries of yellow Velvet, with white and blue Feathers in their Hats; my Lover him&s;elf was dre&s;t with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s, and wore Feathers of the &s;ame Colours in his Hat.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived at the Palace-Gate, he di&s;mounted, and went up the Stairs that led to the Chamber of Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Extreams of Joy and Grief in which my Soul was to&s;t at that tran&s;ient View of him, whom I &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved, and who&s;e Fal&s;hood I &s;o tenderly lamented, kept me a long Time motionle&s;s in the Place where I &s;tood.</P>
<P>At la&s;t recovering my&s;elf a little, I ob|&s;erved <HI>Fabius</HI> waiting his coming out with the re&s;t of his Attendants, and &s;tepping up to him, I drew him a&s;ide, and a&s;ked him who that Nobleman was that had ju&s;t entered the Palace."</P>
<P>Thou mu&s;t beeds be a Stranger here, re|plied he, if thou knowe&s;t not Don <HI>Felix</HI>; why,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Youth, I tell thee, there is not any Nobleman in the Court better known than Don <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P>It may be &s;o, &s;aid I, but I am a Stranger, and would be glad to be informed if he has any particular Rea&s;on for giving Liveries of the&s;e Colours.</P>
<P>If it were not &s;o well known, replied he, I would conceal it, but &s;ince any other Per&s;on can acquaint thee with it as well as my&s;elf, I'll tell thee the Rea&s;on; he loves a Lady of this City, named <HI>Celia,</HI> and 'tis her Colours that he wears.</P>
<P>My wounded Heart bled afre&s;h at this Confirmation of my Unhappine&s;s, yet I di&s;|&s;embled my Emotion, and continued talking to the Page about his Ma&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ion, from whom I gathered that the Lady did not receive it with any Marks of Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;urance animated my drooping Spirits, I pur&s;ued the Conver&s;ation, and <HI>Fa|bius</HI> following the Cu&s;tom of Pages, very freely acquainted me with all his Ma&s;ter's Affairs, from which making a quick Tran&s;i|tion to mine, he a&s;ked me my Name, Coun|try and Condition.</P>
<P>I told him my Name was <HI>Valerius,</HI> my Country, <HI>Vandalia,</HI> and that as yet I had &s;erved no Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Fabius</HI> being de&s;irous, as I was his Countryman, to have me for a Fellow-&s;ervant,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
told me, that his Lord had ordered him to enquire for a Page for him, and that he would recommend me, provided it was agreea|ble to my Inclination: this Propo&s;al I imme|diately accepted, as it afforded me the Means of &s;eeing my Don <HI>Felix</HI> every Day.</P>
<P><HI>Fabius</HI> having mentioned me to him, he ordered my Attendance on him that Evening, and being plea&s;ed with my Appearance, hired me immediately. Alas, this Situation was productive of new Mi&s;eries, for now I was a Witne&s;s, a mournful Witne&s;s to the Me&s;|&s;ages, Letters, and Pre&s;ents that were daily &s;ent my Rival.</P>
<P>"After I had been a Month in his Ser|vice, Don <HI>Felix,</HI> who had conceived an ex|traordinary Liking for me, communicated to me the whole Story of his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Celia,</HI> and gave me a Letter for her, which he charged me to deliver, if po&s;&s;ible, into her own Hands. Judge, charming Nymphs, if this Commi&s;&s;ion was not painful, yet I undertook it, and pro|curing an Audience of the Lady, pre&s;ented her the Letter: <HI>Celia</HI> looking fixedly upon me, re|ceived the Letter, as it &s;hould &s;eem, without knowing what &s;he did. She blu&s;hed, and grew pale alternately, and not able for &s;everal Mi|nutes to remove her Eyes from my Face, &s;he gazed on me with &s;uch a vi&s;ible Emotion, that I plainly perceived my Sight had cau&s;ed &s;ome great Alteration in her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">Recovering her&s;elf, at length &s;he opened the Letter, and ha&s;tily glancing it over, threw it a&s;ide, and again directed her Looks to me."</P>
<P>Fortune, &s;aid &s;he, after a little Pau&s;e, has been very favourable to Don <HI>Felix,</HI> in bring|ing thee to this Court to be his Page."</P>
<P>And to me al&s;o, Madam, &s;aid I, by giv|ing me an Opportunity of &s;eeing a Lady, who&s;e Beauty has, in my Opinion, no equal in the World."</P>
<P><HI>Celia</HI> &s;miling, told me, I had learned of my Ma&s;ter to flatter; yet &s;he did not &s;eem di&s;plea&s;ed with my Di&s;cour&s;e, but protracted my Stay by a&s;king me a great many Que&s;ti|ons concerning <HI>Feli&s;mena,</HI> to whom &s;he had heard Don <HI>Felix</HI> had formerly paid his Ad|dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;ighed and blu&s;hed when &s;he mentioned my Name, but my Emotion e&s;caped her Ob|&s;ervation, and having &s;atisfied her Curio&s;ity about <HI>Feli&s;mena,</HI> who&s;e Beauty, Wit, and Love for Don <HI>Felix,</HI> were the Subjects of her Interrogatories, I entreated her to &s;end &s;ome kind Me&s;&s;age to my Ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>Tell him, &s;aid &s;he, that I have read his Letter, and am willing to believe the Truth of his Profe&s;&s;ions; but, <HI>Valerius,</HI> added &s;he, in a lower Voice, this Favour your Ma&s;ter owes to you, I perceive you love him, and, and to
<PB N="20" REF="23">
oblige you I conde&s;cend to give him this Sa|tisfaction."</P>
<P>She accompanied the&s;e Words with a Look &s;o extreamly expre&s;&s;ive, that I had not the lea&s;t Room to doubt the &s;ecret Purport of them. I bowed re&s;pectfully, and retired, full of Surprize at this unexpected Incident, yet not without a Hope it might produce &s;ome|thing favourable to my Love.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Felix</HI> finding the never received any An|&s;wer from <HI>Celia,</HI> unle&s;s I was the Bearer of his Letter, took Care always to a&s;&s;ign me this Employ|ment. <HI>Celia,</HI> by the&s;e Means, &s;eeing me every Day, conceived a very violent Affection for me, which, however, &s;he only di&s;covered by her Sighs and Looks; but her Indifference towards Don <HI>Felix</HI> was far from producing the Effects I hoped and expected: his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to increa&s;e in Proportion as &s;he neglected him; and &s;o great was his De&s;pair, that apprehend|ing it might endanger his Life, I, whom it might well be imagined, was the la&s;t Per&s;on in the World, who would &s;ollicit her Com|pa&s;&s;ion for him, I, fair Nymphs, threw my|&s;elf at her Feet, and with Tears be&s;ought her to have &s;ome Regard to the &s;ad Condition to which her Rigour had reduced my Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Celia,</HI> who had flattered her&s;elf with the Hopes of having made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on my Heart; imagined by my &s;uppliant Po&s;ture, and the fir&s;t Words I uttered, that I was going to plead for my&s;elf; but no &s;ooner did &s;he hear the
<PB N="21" REF="24">
Name of Don <HI>Felix,</HI> than, lo&s;ing in an In|&s;tant all her former Complacency, her Cheeks glowed with indignant Blu&s;hes, her Eyes fla&s;hed a look of Rage and Di&s;appointment, and ri&s;ing from her Chair with trembling Emotion; 'Be gone, ungrateful, &s;aid &s;he to me, is it for thy Ma&s;ter then thou pleade&s;t, when thou ha&s;t long known my Soul was de|voted to thee? have I lived to be de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;uch a one as thou art? oh! cur&s;ed Fortune, oh, more cur&s;ed Love! but I will be revenged, if not on thee, I will on my&s;elf. My Death &s;hall free me at once from thy &s;corn, and the Upbraidings of my own con&s;cious Mind."</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he flew into an adjoining Apartment, making fa&s;t the Door after her, which left me not the Po&s;&s;ibility of pur&s;uing her, if I had had an Inclination to it.</P>
<P>Grief and Amazement kept me for &s;ome Moments immoveable as a Statue; at length I departed, but my Thoughts were in &s;uch Confu&s;ion at the &s;trange Accident which had happened, that I came into the Pre&s;ence of Don <HI>Felix</HI> without being prepared with any An&s;wer from <HI>Celia.</HI></P>
<P>His eager Interrogatories rou&s;ing me from the deep Reverie into which I was plunged, I replied at Random that <HI>Celia</HI> was engaged with Company, and that I could not procure an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Felix</HI> &s;ighing profoundly, told me, I mu&s;t go then the next Day. I did, but oh!
<PB N="22" REF="25">
fair Nymphs of the cha&s;te Godde&s;s, what was my A&s;toni&s;hment and Grief, when I was in|formed by <HI>Celia</HI>'s chief Attendant that &s;he was dead, having expired &s;ome Hours after I left her, in a fainting Fit.</P>
<P>Had my Soul been le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of Ten|derne&s;s and Gratitude than it was, the Death of a Rival had not di&s;turbed it &s;o much, but knowing my&s;elf to be the unhappy, though innocent Cau&s;e of her Death, I could not hear of it without feeling the deepe&s;t Afflic|tion, which, the Apprehen&s;ion of Don <HI>Felix</HI>'s Sorrow, increa&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree, that I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>At my Return Home I found him lo&s;t in the wilde&s;t Agonies of De&s;pair; the News had already reached him; none of his Servants dur&s;t approach him; he even commanded me, who was his Favourite, out of his Pre&s;ence: Heaven knows with what Reluctance I obeyed. &mdash;From that fatal Day I &s;aw him no more, he departed without acquainting any of his Friends or Servants with the Place to which he de&s;igned to go.</P>
<P>No Words can paint the Torments I en|dured at this new Misfortune; deprived of his Pre&s;ence for whom I only wi&s;hed to live, I loathed the Sight of Day, I cur&s;ed my Fate, my haple&s;s Love, and all Things, but my <HI>Fe|lix.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Agonies were too violent to con|tinue long; Nature was too weak to &s;upport

them; their Rage at Length &s;ub&s;ided; a calm of Grief en&s;ued, and Hope, the fal&s;e intoxicat|ing Friend, of Love, repre&s;ented it &s;till po&s;&s;i|ble for me to be happy if I could find my <HI>Fe|lix.</HI></P>
<P>Rou&s;ed by this flattering Thought, I re|&s;olved to &s;eek him through the World, and have already wa&s;ted two Years in my Pur&s;uit of him.</P>
<P>Chance brought me to the&s;e Plains, where being &s;truck with the peaceful Simplicity of a pa&s;toral Life, and ab&s;olutely de&s;pairing ever to &s;ee Don <HI>Felix</HI> more, I threw off the Habit of a Man, and in the Weeds of a Shepherde&s;s, wandered through the&s;e Woods, &s;till nouri&s;h|ing with Solitude and Tears the fatal Pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;umes me.</P>
<P>Heaven, by affording me an Opportuni|ty of delivering you, fair Nymphs, from the Danger with which you were threatened, &s;eems to be preparing a Rever&s;e of Fate for me; the fir&s;t Ray of Joy that ever dawned upon my Soul &s;ince the Ab&s;ence of my beloved Don <HI>Felix,</HI> was occa&s;ioned by being made the In|&s;trument of your Deliverance; oh! may it be a happy Omen of Fortune's future Favours; let me hail it as the Beginning of that Happi|ne&s;s which the Sight of my Don <HI>Felix</HI> will rai&s;e me to."</P>

<P>The Reader, by comparing the Incidents that compo&s;e the Fable of <HI>The Two Gentle|men of Verona,</HI> with tho&s;e in the foregoing Sto|ry, will ea&s;ily perceive that <HI>Protheus</HI> and <HI>Julia</HI> in the Play are the &s;ame with <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Feli&s;|mena</HI> in the Novel.</P>

<P><HI>Silvia,</HI> notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming Indif|ference, is &s;o violently in Love with <HI>Valentine,</HI> that being prevented in her De&s;ign of mar|rying him privately, and in Con&s;equence of her refu&s;ing to marry Sir <HI>Thurio</HI> (a fooli&s;h Knight whom the Duke thinks a fit Match for the Prince&s;s, his Daughter, becau&s;e he has a great deal of Money) being confined in a high Tower, re&s;olves to for&s;ake her Father's Court, and follow the bani&s;hed <HI>Valentine</HI> to <HI>Mantua.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">The poor Prince&s;s being in &s;uch a perplex|ing Situation, confined, guarded, and not &s;uf|fered to have any Corre&s;pondence with any Per&s;on, but her de&s;tined Husband <HI>Thurio,</HI> and her Lover's fal&s;e Friend <HI>Protheus</HI> one would imagine &s;ome great Degree of Invention mu&s;t be exerted to contrive a probable Stratagem to relea&s;e her.</P>
<P>The Poet gets over this Difficulty with wonderful Ea&s;e: <HI>Silvia</HI> is &s;hewn talking from her Chamber-window in the Tower in broad Day, to Sir <HI>Eglamour,</HI> her Confidant, below, &s;ettling with him, whom &s;he de&s;ires to accom|pany her, the Method of her E&s;cape, which is to be effected by his meeting her with Hor&s;es at Friar <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cell, whither &s;he intends to go to Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To make all this probable, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the Spies and Guards &s;et over this Prin|ce&s;s, mu&s;t be all blind, otherwi&s;e &s;he and Sir <HI>Eglamour</HI> mu&s;t unavoidably be &s;een by them. &mdash;Tis al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be deaf, or el&s;e they could not fail to hear the whole Contrivance; for her Chamber, we are inform|ed, is in a high Tower, at a great Di&s;tance from the Ground, which made it impa&s;&s;ible for Sir <HI>Eglamour</HI> and her to &s;ettle their Schemes in Whi&s;pers: and la&s;tly, 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, that this confined Prince&s;s &s;hould have the Liberty of rambling alone out of her Tow|er to Confe&s;&s;ion, or &s;he could not &s;o confi|dently
<PB N="32" REF="35">
make an A&s;&s;ignation with <HI>Eglamour</HI> at Friar <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cell, nor &s;o &s;ecurely keep it.</P>
<P>Nothing, can be more incon&s;i&s;tent than the Character of <HI>Valentine</HI>; nothing more impro|per than the Manners attributed to him as a Lover.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured as he is with <HI>Silvia,</HI> he recommends a new Lover to her with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, and will not be &s;atisfied 'till &s;he promi&s;es to entertain him.</P>
<P>When he is bani&s;hed to <HI>Milan,</HI> and in the extreame&s;t De&s;pair for the Lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Fear of Death prevails upon him to be|come the Head of a Gang of Banditti, and having in this Situation fortunately re&s;cued his beloved <HI>Silvia,</HI> from the Violence of his treacherous Friend, who was going to ravi&s;h her, a few repentant Words uttered by that Friend, makes him re&s;olve to re&s;ign her to him, notwith&s;tanding the generous Proof &s;he had given him of her Tenderne&s;s, in run|ning &s;o many Hazards to be with him.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P>This Part of the Intrigue of the Play, &s;uch as it is, that relates to the Loves of <HI>Silvia</HI> and <HI>Valentine,</HI> is probably the Poet's own Inven|tion; but the Adventure of <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Pro|theus</HI> are copied clo&s;ely from the Pa&s;toral Ro|mance.</P>
<P>The Poet drops the Story at the Flight of <HI>Silvia,</HI> and adds all the remaining Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>He al&s;o paints <HI>Protheus</HI> in much more di&s;|advantageous Colours, than he is repre&s;ented in the Original; there we find him indeed in|con&s;tant to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who loves him pa&s;&s;i|onately, and for&s;aking her for one that treats him with the utmo&s;t Di&s;dain.</P>
<P>But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;hews him treacherous in the highe&s;t Degree to his Friend, ba&s;e and ungrateful to the Duke his Benefactor, and guilty of intended Violence towards the Wo|man he profe&s;&s;es to love; yet, wicked as he is, he e&s;capes not only without Puni&s;hment, but is made as happy as the renewed Tender|ne&s;s of his injured Friend, and the inviolable Fidelity of his once loved <HI>Julia</HI> can make him.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">The Character of <HI>Julia</HI> is much nearer the Original than that of <HI>Protheus</HI>; but in the Romance we find her, when &s;he is in the Quality of a Page to Don <HI>Felix,</HI> exerting a very extraordinary kind of Genero&s;ity, in &s;olli|citing her Rival's Favour for her Lover.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> very judiciou&s;ly makes her act a quite contrary Part, in&s;tead of endeavouring to move her Rival's Compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Protheus,</HI> &s;he tries to engage it for the unhappy Object of his former Affection, repre&s;enting her Love, her Con&s;tancy, her Grief at being abandoned, in the mo&s;t pathetic Terms, and by artfully intermixing &s;ome Prai&s;es of her Beauty, in&s;i|nuates the little Reliance &s;he ought to have upon the pro&s;tituted Vows of a Man &s;o prone to change.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of <HI>Feli&s;mena</HI> upon her Maid's offering her a Letter from Don <HI>Felix,</HI> in the Romance, is plainly the Foundation of the following Scene in the Play; and though the Dialogue is not copied, yet the ridiculous Prudery of the Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the artful Ma|nagement of the Maid, have &s;o near a Re|&s;emblance, that it cannot be doubted <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> had it in his Eye.</P>

<P>This Play every where abounds with the mo&s;t ridiculous Ab&s;urdities in the Plot and Conduct of the Incidents, as well as with the greate&s;t Improprieties in the Manners and Sen|timents of the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould meet with her Lover in the Wood, without having the Power of making her&s;elf invi&s;ible, gets away from her Guards, and out of her high Tower, and gallops like an Ama|zon, attended only by one Squire to <HI>Mantua.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no Wonder therefore, that in &s;uch an Equipage, and engaged in &s;uch a romantic De|&s;ign, &s;he &s;hould fall into the Hands of the
<PB N="45" REF="48">
Banditti; nor that &s;he &s;hould meet with her Lover among&s;t them, &s;ince the Poet had pre|pared us for this wonderful Incident, by a pre|ceding one, full as a&s;toni&s;hing, in making the noble Youth the Captain of this Band of Villains.</P>
<P>It &s;eeming nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to the Poet's De|&s;ign, that the Duke of <HI>Milan</HI> &s;hould fall into the &s;ame Danger, we find the good old Prince, upon the News of his Daughter's Flight, in|&s;tead of di&s;patching &s;everal Parties of his Guards different Ways to overtake and bring her back, mounting his Hor&s;e him&s;elf, and with no other Attendants than <HI>Protheus,</HI> who is a Stranger in his Dominions, and <HI>Thurio,</HI> the fooli&s;h Knight he de&s;igned for his Son-in-law, riding-away in Search of her.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that by this Management he mu&s;t fall into the Hands of the Banditti, and accordingly there we meet with him next. The Duke's be&s;towing his Daughter upon <HI>Va|lentine,</HI> whom he finds at the Head of this de&s;perate Gang of Ruffians, after refu&s;ing her to him, when he lived in his Court with an unblemi&s;hed Reputation, is indeed a little in|comprehen&s;ible, as is al&s;o <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Willing|ne&s;s to re&s;ign his beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s to his fal&s;e Friend, who had offered Violence to her Cha|&s;tity, and <HI>Silvia's</HI> giving her Hand to him, after &s;o &s;triking a Proof of his Indifference and Ingratitude.</P>
<P>I cannot omit taking Notice of one Blun|der among many others I &s;hall pa&s;s over; <HI>Va|lentine</HI>;
<PB N="46" REF="49">
after having ju&s;t before declared, that it is with Difficulty he re&s;trains the Villains who had cho&s;en him for their Chief from the mo&s;t brutal Outrages, recommends them to the Duke's Favour with the&s;e Words;
<Q><L>The&s;e bani&s;h'd Men that I have kept withal,</L>
<L>Are Men endow'd with worthy Qualities:</L>
<L>Forgive them what they have committed here,</L>
<L>And let them be recalled from their Exile;</L>
<L>They are reform'd, civil, full of Good,</L>
<L>And fit for great Employment, worthy Lord.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>The Story of <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> From CHAUCER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Story of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War is well known; the Princes of <HI>Greece</HI> united in Arms for the Recovery of <HI>Helen,</HI> and to re|venge her Rape, had be&s;ieged <HI>Troy</HI> almo&s;t ten Years with va|rious Succe&s;s; when <HI>Calcas,</HI> one of the prin|cipal Lords of <HI>Troy,</HI> went over to their Party.</P>
<P>To this Nobleman, who was very well &s;killed in Divine My&s;teries, <HI>Apollo</HI> revealed the certain De&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and to prevent his being a Partaker in the foredoom'd De&s;olation of his Country, he &s;tole privately out of the Ci|ty, and fled to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, making U&s;e of his Skill in fore&s;eeing Things to come, to recommend him to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who finding great Advantage from this his Science, held him in high E&s;teem.</P>
<P>The News of <HI>Calcas</HI>'s Flight being &s;pread through the City, the People enraged at his Treachery, were for &s;acrificing all the Rela|tions and Friends he had left behind him to their Revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58"><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> his only Daughter, a young Lady of exqui&s;ite Beauty, being wholly ignorant of her Father's Flight, was more than any other a&s;toni&s;hed at the News. Di&s;tracted with Shame for the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Treachery of her Father, and wild with her Fears of the In&s;ults of the enraged Populace, &s;he ca&s;t her&s;elf at the Feet of <HI>Hector</HI> in a mourning Habit, and, with Tears prote&s;ting her own Innocence, implored his Protection.</P>
<P>The generous Heart of <HI>Hector</HI> was greatly moved with the Di&s;tre&s;s of the kneeling Beau|ty. He rai&s;ed her up, and a&s;&s;ured her, her Father's Trea&s;on &s;hould reflect no Di&s;honour upon her, that &s;he &s;hould enjoy his E&s;tates, and, if &s;he plea&s;ed, live happy in <HI>Troy</HI> under his Protection.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> thanked him with a graceful Hu|mility, and returning to her Hou&s;e, began, from thenceforward, to live with the greate&s;t Privacy and Retirement; &s;o nicely con&s;cious &s;he was of her Father's Di&s;grace, and &s;o de|licately attentive to her own unhappy Situa|tion, that the People, charmed with her Con|duct, no longer remembered the Trea&s;on of her Father to her Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>It was the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Troy</HI> to celebrate the Fea&s;t of <HI>Pallas</HI> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> the King's Sons, with the Matrons and Maids of Quality, and the Knights of <HI>Troy,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this Solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">The charming <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> though dre&s;&s;ed in a Widow's Habit, appeared with a thou&s;and Advantages among the Re&s;t. Her Beauty, like a bright Star breaking through the Veil of an envious Cloud, dazzled the whole A&s;&s;embly; unmoved with the murmured Prai&s;es &s;he heard around her, and de&s;irous of e&s;caping Notice, &s;he &s;tood with humble Mode&s;ty near the Door; bending her lovely Eyes on the Ground, while the Blu&s;hes which &s;ometimes crim&s;oned over her fair Face, and the &s;weet Pen&s;ivene&s;s of her Attitude, &s;hewed her Thoughts were more employed on her Father's Unhappine&s;s, than the Admiration her Form excited.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were ever wandering in &s;earch of fair Objects, though fixed on no particular one, was among the la&s;t, who took Notice of the beauteous <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida.</HI> This young Prince, gay, hand&s;ome, and a Warrior, had never felt the &s;oft Inquietudes of Love; he de&s;pi&s;ed the Power of the winged Deity, and triumphing in his own Indifference, laughed at the Torments of others; roving, as was his Cu&s;tom, through the Temple with &s;ome of his young Knights, and behold|ing with wandering Glances the Ladies as they &s;tood, often &s;lily leering on his Companions, to ob&s;erve if any of them breathed a Sigh, or darted a de&s;iring Look at one of them. The God of Love, offended with his continual Mockeries, bent his Bow that Moment in a Rage, and &s;ent one of his keene&s;t Arrows to
<PB N="58" REF="60">
his Heart: the lovely pen&s;ive <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> was the Object that fixed his Attention.</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! cried he to him&s;elf, while his Eyes fea&s;ted on the ravi&s;hing Beauties of her Face, Where ha&s;t thou been hid thus long, thou that art &s;o lovely fair? Where has &s;uch matchle&s;s Beauty been concealed, that my de|lighted Eyes were never ble&s;&s;ed with it before? While he was thus contemplating her with Emo|tions he had 'till then been a Stranger to, <HI>Cre&s;|&s;ida</HI> rai&s;ing her Head, turned her bright Eyes by Chance on <HI>Troilus,</HI> and with that Look com|pleated the Conque&s;t of his Heart. He &s;igh|ed, as with an ardent Gaze he met the lan|gui&s;hing, yet too powerful Glance of the af|flicted Beauty; and &s;he ha&s;tily averting her Face, again he &s;ighed, and con&s;cious of his former Injuries to Love, turned to his Com|panions to &s;ee if any of them ob&s;erved his new Di&s;order, leaving the Temple, at length he went Home to his own Palace.</P>
<P>Solitude now was all he &s;ought, and di&s;mi&s;s|ing his Companions, on Pretence of private Bu&s;ine&s;s, he retired to his Chamber to indulge his new Meditations, there making a Mirror of his Mind, he contemplated the Image of the beauteous <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>; his raptured Fancy dwelt upon the inchanting Look &s;he gave him, and every recollected Charm added Strength to the fatal Pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;umed him.</P>
<P>Love giving new Ardour to the bright Flames of Glory, he ru&s;hed with more than
<PB N="59" REF="61">
mortal Courage to the Field; yet was it not his Hatred to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> nor his De&s;ire of pre&s;erving the Town, which poured the Thun|der of his re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Arm upon the Foe: Re|nown he fought, but fought it only to make him more worthy of the lovely <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida.</HI> True Love is ever accompanied with Diffidence and Fear: <HI>Troilus,</HI> though a Prince, young, love|ly, and the Object of general E&s;teem; yet pined in &s;eeret, without daring to reveal his Pa&s;&s;ion to her who in&s;pired it.</P>
<P>De&s;pair took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul at the &s;ame Moment that he became a Slave to Love; he pa&s;&s;ed whole Nights in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghs, Tears, and Complaints; his Cheeks had no longer the Fre&s;hne&s;s of Youth, his Eyes lo&s;t their &s;park|ling Lu&s;tre, Melancholy was painted in his Mien, and Dejection &s;at on every Feature.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> the Uncle of <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and the intimate Friend of <HI>Troilus,</HI> having for &s;ome time ob&s;erved, and wondered at this &s;trange Alteration, re&s;olved to make him, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;clo&s;e the Cau&s;e: For this Purpo&s;e he went early one Morning to his Palace, and entering his Apartment, without giving any previous Notice, found the unhappy Youth &s;eated on his Bed, his Arms folded pa&s;&s;ionately on his Brea&s;t, his Head reclined, and all the Marks of the mo&s;t profound Sorrow &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on his Countenance.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> lo&s;t in A&s;toni&s;hment and Grief, &s;tood &s;ome Moments at a Di&s;tance, contem|plating

him without being perceived by the love-&s;ick Prince, who&s;e Thoughts were &s;o inten&s;ely fixed on the Idea of the lovely <HI>Cre&s;|&s;ida,</HI> that he had no Eyes or Ears for external Objects. O ye Gods! exclaimed <HI>Pandarus</HI> at la&s;t, what can this mean, is it the <HI>Greeks,</HI> my Prince, that have reduced you to this Con|dition? O Shame to Manhood! &s;hall tho&s;e Enemies of our Country boa&s;t of having over|thrown one of its &s;tronge&s;t Pillars? Or has &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic Fit of Devotion &s;iezed thy Mind, and given thee up to more than Wo|man's Softne&s;s? Art thou mourning for &s;ome imaginary Crime, and trying to appea&s;e the offended Deities with Tears?</P>
<P>The artful <HI>Pandarus</HI> &s;poke in this Manner, not becau&s;e he doubted the Courage of <HI>Troilus,</HI> of which he had given a Thou&s;and glorious Proofs, but that by this Reproach, he might awake him from that Lethargy of Woe in which he &s;aw him &s;unk, and rou&s;e him to a more noble Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;lowly rai&s;ing his Head, and be|holding his Friend, with Eyes that betrayed no other Emotion than Grief; Ah, &s;aid he, with a Voice almo&s;t &s;mothered with Sighs, what ill Chance brought thee hither to behold my lo&s;t Condition? Leave me, I conjure thee by the Gods, &s;tay not to &s;ee me die, for well I know my Death will give thee Pain; and yet, alas, &s;uch is my extream Affliction, that Death is all the Relief I can expect; but yet, pur&s;ued he, after a little Pau&s;e, and rai&s;ing his
<PB N="61" REF="63">
Voice, while a faint Blu&s;h di&s;pelled for a Mo|ment the languid Palene&s;s of his Cheek, Think not, my <HI>Pandarus,</HI> that it is Dread of the <HI>Greeks</HI> which has brought thy Friend thus low; ah! 'tis a Power &s;tronger far than theirs; not the united Force of their whole Army could &s;ink thy <HI>Troilus</HI> thus. My Soul, my Soul's &s;ubdued, and that's beyond their Reach. Oh, my <HI>Pandarus,</HI> enquire no more; I cannot, dare not, will not tell thee more; leave me, again I bid thee leave me, it is not fit the Cau&s;e of my De&s;pair &s;hould be revealed; no, let it re&s;t in everla&s;ting Silence, and peri&s;h with my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid <HI>Pandarus,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively moved, what is this Affliction that is to be concealed from me? Oh, Prince, if ever there was Love and Truth betwixt us, do not, I be&s;eech thee, do not commit &s;o great a Cruelty, as to hide your Sorrows from me; if I cannot give you Comfort, I will partake your Pain. I have a Friend's Right in your Di&s;tre&s;s, deprive me not of it, le&s;t I &s;u&s;pect your Truth, or ima|gine you doubt mine.</P>
<P>Ah! &s;aid <HI>Troilus,</HI> &s;ighing, you have con|quered, my <HI>Pandarus</HI>; to you, and you on|ly will I di&s;cover my Weakne&s;s. Love, to who&s;e Power I have been &s;o long a Rebel, hath &s;hot his fierce&s;t Fires into my Heart; I burn, I rage with ardent Pa&s;&s;ion; I langui&s;h with De&s;ire, and, oh! De&s;pair con&s;umes me. What have I then to do but die? &s;ince Death alone can free me from my Torments!</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">Ah, Prince! &s;aid <HI>Pandarus,</HI> it was unkind|ly done to conceal &s;o long your Pa&s;&s;ion from your Friend.

Alas! interrupted <HI>Troilus,</HI> thou who ha&s;t been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in Love, with what Confidence can'&s;t thou undertake to make me happy?</P>
<P>I have been unfortunate, 'tis true, replied <HI>Pandarus</HI>; but tho&s;e Misfortunes have taught me that Experience which you want: hence am I qualified to give you Coun&s;el that may prevent your falling into the Evils I have &s;uf|fered. Oft have I &s;een a blind Man walk &s;e|curely, where one who was ble&s;t with perfect Sight has &s;tumbled. Well does the Proverb &s;ay,
<Q>A Fool full often may, a wi&s;e Man guide.</Q>
A Whet&s;tone is not, indeed, an In&s;trument to carve with; but it &s;harpens tho&s;e that do. If then you think I have committed Errors, let my Folly be your School; and learn therein to avoid what I have been undone by. Every|thing, my dear Prince, is be&s;t explained by its contrary. The Palate that never ta&s;ted Bitterne&s;s has not &s;o quick a Reli&s;h for Sweets: The Heart that never langui&s;hed with Di&s;tre&s;s, is blunted to the gentle Thrils of Plea&s;ure.

<P><PB N="63" REF="65">The Prince appeared wholly in&s;en&s;ible to this Di&s;cour&s;e, not once lifting up his Eyes, or giving the &s;malle&s;t Indication that he heard it. <HI>Pandarus,</HI> who&s;e Re&s;entment was awakened by this Neglect, began to &s;hake him by the Arm, as if he &s;uppo&s;ed him in a Lethargy; Rou&s;e, rou&s;e your&s;elf, for &s;hame, he cried, from this Stupidity; nor li&s;ten like the droni&s;h Bea&s;t of Burden to what I &s;ay, who, when a Harp is playing, hears the Sound, but knows not that 'tis Mu&s;ic.</P>

<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> touched to his inmo&s;t Soul with this predicted Shame, &s;tarted wildly from his Seat; and traver&s;ing the Room with great Emotion, &s;topt &s;uddenly, and looking fixedly on his Friend, Oh! &s;aid he with a Sigh, what mu&s;t I do!</P>
<P>Tell me the Name of her you love, &s;aid <HI>Pandarus</HI>; &s;ay, do I know her? If &s;o, I &s;hall &s;ucceed the better in my Applications.</P>
<P>This Que&s;tion threw the love-&s;ick Prince into &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that, not being able, to &s;tand, again he &s;unk upon his Bed; his Face glowed with Blu&s;hes; his con&s;cious Eyes bent their Looks upon the Ground; he &s;igh'd, he trembled, but continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> heedfully ob&s;erving his Emotion, exclaimed in a tran&s;ported Tone; Ah, Prince! I &s;ee I am intere&s;ted in this Fair One: by <HI>Venus</HI> and her &s;portful Son you &s;hall conceal her Name no longer.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">And will you know her Name, &s;aid <HI>Troilus,</HI> (trembling) Oh, my <HI>Pandarus!</HI> the Name of my &s;weet Enemy is <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> thy Niece, my Friend.</P>
<P>Here his Voice falter'd; he &s;top'd, he &s;igh'd, while Fear, Hope, and anxious Expectation at once a&s;&s;ailed his Heart with all their Force, and gave &s;uch Meaning to his wi&s;hing Eyes, that <HI>Pandarus,</HI> eager to relieve his Inquietude, &s;trained him to his Brea&s;t with an affectionate Embrace: Be comforted, my Prince, cried he (in a Tone that expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Degree of Satisfaction) <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> &s;hall be yours, if I have any Power over her; you are worthy of her and &s;he of you; not <HI>Hellen</HI> her&s;elf can boa&s;t a brighter Form than <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>; add to that, her blooming Youth, her amiable Mode&s;ty, the mingled Sweetne&s;s and Dignity of her Manners. &mdash;Oh, Prince! &s;he &s;hall be yours; I &s;wear by Heaven &s;he &s;hall: no more complaining then; bani&s;h your Fears, and rely upon my Will and Power to make you happy.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> almo&s;t out of him&s;elf with Joy at this unexpected good Fortune, hung upon his Neck awhile in &s;peechle&s;s Tran&s;ports; then &s;uddenly exclaiming, Come now, ye <HI>Greeks</HI>! cried he, oppo&s;e your whole united Force again&s;t this Brea&s;t; <HI>Troilus</HI> &s;hall &s;tand it all! his Love &s;hall give him double Vigour, and ye &s;hall feel it to your Co&s;t!

<P>Farewell, my Friend, &s;aid <HI>Pandarus</HI> (getting loo&s;e from his Embraces) I will de&s;erve your Thanks; a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I will: In the mean time, &s;trengthen your Heart with Hope; I go to &s;eek your Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Words he retired; and <HI>Troilus,</HI> now animated with double Fires, called eagerly for his Armour, and, mounting his Hor&s;e, ru&s;hed terrible to the Field: Happy was the <HI>Greek</HI> that fled the Thunder of his Arm that Day; in&s;pired with more than mortal Courage, like a va&s;t Torrent, he poured re&s;i&s;tle&s;s on the Foe, and bore down all before him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Pandarus,</HI> anxiou&s;ly &s;ol|licitous to perform the Promi&s;es he had made to <HI>Troilus,</HI> went to his Niece's Hou&s;e; he found her alone in her Apartment, reading; and placing him&s;elf near her, after &s;ome general Di&s;cour&s;e, he objected to her mourning Habit and &s;olitary Way of Life; which, on Account of her Father's di&s;graceful Flight to the Enemies of his Country, &s;he &s;till continued to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Why, my charming Niece! &s;aid he (pur&s;uing his Di&s;cour&s;e) why do you wa&s;te your Days in Loneline&s;s and Woe?

<P>Ah!

Alas! it is not for me to mix among the happy Youth of Troy; pre&s;&s;ed down as I am by my Father's Di&s;grace, and my too con&s;cious feel|ing of it: No; let me in Retirement conceal the Part I take in his Shame; Retirement, which, from being nece&s;&s;ary, is become my Choice: Love will not &s;eek me here; he flies the Mi&s;erable, and only dwells with Chearful|ne&s;s and Peace.</P>
<P>No more of the&s;e melancholy Reflexions, &s;aid <HI>Pandarus</HI> (ki&s;&s;ing away the Tears that fell from her charming Eyes) you know not how bountiful the Gods have been to you. Oh, Niece! they have be&s;towed a Ble&s;&s;ing on you greater than your mo&s;t &s;anguine Wi&s;hes dur&s;t a&s;pire at.</P>
<P>He &s;topp'd abruptly here; and, thinking he had &s;aid enough to awaken the Woman's Curio&s;ity in her, affected to talk of other Things; and, &s;hortly after, ro&s;e up to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> who had been plea&s;ingly alarmed by what her Uncle had &s;aid, and was greatly di&s;appointed at his di&s;continuing the Di&s;cour&s;e,

&s;aw him about to depart with Unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he wi&s;hed to be delivered from the Perplexity his Hints had thrown her into, but Shame pre|vented her from a&s;king an Explanation of them.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus</HI> ob&s;erved her Confu&s;ion with Plea|&s;ure; he moved on towards the Door; &s;he fol|lowed him with downca&s;t Eyes; he turned to bid her farewel; adieu! an&s;wered &s;he, with He&s;itation, then &s;eeming to recollect at that In|&s;tant what had pa&s;t, But will you go, &s;aid &s;he, (blu&s;hing, and half averting her fair Face) with|out telling me what good Fortune it is for which I ought this Day to thank the Gods?</P>
<P><HI>Panadarus,</HI> having brought her to the Point he de&s;ired, took her Hand with a Smile, and lead|ing her to a Chair, &s;eated him&s;elf clo&s;e by her: It would be cruel, my deare&s;t Niece, &s;aid he, to keep you longer in Su&s;pence; know then you are beloved by one of the Sons of your King, the young, the brave, the lovely <HI>Troilus</HI>; never did any Heart glow with more ardent Fires than his: he langui&s;hes, he dies for you, my <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>; compa&s;&s;ionate his Pains, reward him with your Heart, and ta&s;te the Sweets of mutual Love.</P>
<P>Ah, me! interrupted <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and is it for a Lover then, that I mu&s;t thank the Gods! Is this the glorious Fortune they have de&s;tined for me! and can you, Oh, my Uncle! can you re&s;olve to lead me through the dangerous Paths of Plea&s;ure?

<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> alarmed at this Menace of her Uncle's, and at his ri&s;ing to leave her ha&s;tily, &s;eized his Arm; Stay, Oh &s;tay! &s;he cried; all that is con&s;i&s;tent with my Honour I'll do to &s;ave you both: I'll &s;ee the Prince; I'll treat him mildly; I'll not forbid him to hope;&mdash;but a&s;k no more: my Honour's dearer to me than Life; &s;wear your De&s;igns extend no farther than what I have promi&s;ed, and I am &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72"><HI>Pandarus,</HI> a&s;&s;uring her, with the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Oaths, that he would not pre&s;s her to any greater Compliances, perceiving her Fears were quieted, began to talk of indifferent Mat|ters; which, <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> who&s;e Soul was all in Tumult, li&s;tened to with great Impatience; interrupting him, at length; I would fain know, &s;aid &s;he, (with a con&s;cious Blu&s;h) in what Man|ner you fir&s;t became acquainted with Prince <HI>Troilu</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion for me? Did he declare it to you him&s;elf? Does he know how to gild a Love-&s;ick Tale with &s;oft prevailing Eloquence?</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> with a Smile of Plea&s;ure at this Demand, related to her, &s;uccinctly, all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and <HI>Troilus,</HI> and painted his Love and his De&s;pair in Colours &s;o lively, that the half-vanqui&s;hed <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> unwilling her Uncle &s;hould &s;ee her Emotions, ro&s;e up, and begging his Excu&s;e, retired to her Clo&s;et, to contemplate at lei&s;ure on what had befallen her: There fir&s;t the Idea of <HI>Troilus,</HI> young, brave, and lovely as &s;he had &s;een him; tender, pa&s;|&s;ionate, and langui&s;hing as her Uncle repre|&s;ented him, ro&s;e to her Imagination. Softened and prepared by her artful Uncle to receive the dangerous Impre&s;&s;ion, her Fancy dwelt with a Plea&s;ure, till then unknown, upon the Graces of his Form, his royal Birth, his exalted Cou|rage, in a Youth &s;o blooming: her Vanity was flattered by the Preference he gave her to all the <HI>Trojan</HI> Beauties of the Court; and her Com|pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;en&s;ibly engaged by the Pains he &s;uf|fer'd for her Sake, Love fir&s;t entering her Soul
<PB N="71" REF="73">
in the Di&s;gui&s;e of Gratitude, waked there a lambent Flame, who&s;e plea&s;ing Warmth play'd gently round her Heart, and filled it with a new and &s;weet Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;at thus, wholly lo&s;t in plea&s;ing Reflexions, &s;he heard a loud Shouting in the Street, that rou&s;ed her from her Reverie, and made her ha&s;tily run to her Window to &s;ee the Occa&s;ion of it; but what was her mingled Surpri&s;e and Confu&s;ion when &s;he beheld Prince <HI>Troilus,</HI> the Object of her Contemplation!</P>
<P>The young Hero having that Day performed the mo&s;t amazing Acts of Valour, and driven the <HI>Greeks</HI> quite back to their Ships, was re|turning home, amid&s;t the Acclamations of a numerous Croud, who made the Skies re&s;ound with their loud Prai&s;es: He was &s;eated on a bay Steed, who, by rea&s;on of the Wounds he had received in the Fight, carried him along with a &s;low Pace; all richly armed he was, ex|cept his Head; &s;o that his lovely Face being expo&s;ed to View, and made more lovely by the decent Shame which glowed in bright Ver|milion on his Cheek, he charmed the eager Gazers into a Rapture of Delight: His Hel|met, which hung carele&s;sly by a String behind, was hewn in twenty Places; his Shield was pierced with Spears, and many Arrows were to be &s;een &s;till &s;ticking in different Parts of it; his Hor&s;e was marked with Blood that &s;treamed from &s;everal Parts of his Body.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">In this fierce Equipage he would have look'd like the great God of War him&s;elf, had not his charming Face expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ofter and more amiable Divinity: <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> drew back her Head the Moment &s;he beheld him; con&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;ed in her Heart, a crim&s;on Blu&s;h glowed in each lovely Cheek; but though &s;he had determined in her Mind not to look on him, again her Eyes involuntary &s;ought him out; again &s;he blu&s;hed, alarm'd at her own Weak|ne&s;s; again with an averted Look &s;he tried to conceal the new-born &s;weet Anxiety from her|&s;elf; but it was in vain: &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t the powerful Impul&s;e that drew her Eyes, to|wards him; and kept them fixed upon him till he was out of Sight.</P>
<P>This unexpected View of the young Hero, in all the Pomp and Pageantry of War, bear|ing away the chiefe&s;t Honours of the Field, and crowned with the grateful Prai&s;es of his de|livered Country, compleated what her Uncle's Artifices had begun, and made an entire Con|que&s;t of her Heart: Love, with all its Train of gentle Wi&s;hes, Hopes, Fears, and &s;oft In|quietudes, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Brea&s;t: Awhile &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the &s;weet Invader, and oppo&s;ed her Rea&s;on to the &s;ubtle Flame; but &s;o unequal was the Conte&s;t, &s;o weak her Defence, &s;o powerful the A&s;&s;ault, that neither hoping, nor perhaps de&s;iring to be free, &s;he gave her&s;elf up a willing Slave to the &s;oft Chains of Love.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">In the mean time <HI>Troilus,</HI> full of eager Anxiety to know his Fate, no &s;ooner arrived at his own Palace than he di&s;patched &s;ome of his Attendants to different Places to find out <HI>Pandarus,</HI> and to bring him thither.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus</HI> immediately obeyed the Summons, and related, to his impatient Friend, all the Conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and his Niece. He de&s;cribed her Looks, her Sighs, her Blu&s;hes, her &s;weet Irre&s;olution, and thence derived &s;ufficient Encouragement for the trembling Lover to write, and, in his own pathetic language, &s;ollicit her future Favour.</P>
<P>Love having dictated, to the ready Pen of <HI>Troilus,</HI> the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Elo|quence that ever won a female Heart, <HI>Pan|darus</HI> undertook to deliver the Letter, and accordingly carried it that In&s;tant to <HI>Cre&s;|&s;ida:</HI> The mounting Blood flu&s;h'd in her charming Face as &s;oon as he offered the Billet to her Peru&s;al; then ran again in Tides tumul|tuous to her Heart, and left her pale, trem|bling, and ready to &s;ink before him; he took her Hand, he pre&s;&s;ed it tenderly in his, he &s;wore by all the cele&s;tial Deities, no Harm was meant to her Honour, and conjured her, if &s;he had not re&s;olved the De&s;truction of the noble <HI>Troilus,</HI> to read and an&s;wer his Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> rea&s;&s;ured by her Uncle's Prote&s;ta|tions, took the Letter from him, and retired to her Chamber to read it. The moving lan|guage
<PB N="74" REF="76">
it contained, had &s;o &s;udden and &s;o power|ful an Effect on her &s;oft Heart, that &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed upon, by her Uncle to write a favourable An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Corre&s;pondence thus happily begun, the officious <HI>Pandarus</HI> never failed every Day to carry Letters, Me&s;&s;ages, and Pre&s;ents be|tween the Lovers, nor cea&s;ed his Solicitations in favour of <HI>Troilus</HI> to his Niece, till he had won her to yield to his De&s;ires.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> at once the happy Favourite of <HI>Cu|pid</HI> and of <HI>Mars,</HI> was as glorious in the Field as &s;ucce&s;sful in his Love; the <HI>Greeks</HI> trembled at his Name, and the <HI>Trojans</HI> in him revered a &s;econd <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> &s;till continuing her &s;olitary way of Life, &s;ilently enjoyed the Prai&s;es of her beloved Hero; at her Feet the pa&s;&s;ionate Warrior of|fered all his laurels; for her he fought and conquered, and &s;ought his Recompence only in her Smiles. But Fortune, weary of &s;hower|ing Favours, on the&s;e happy Lovers, prepared a &s;ad Rever&s;e of Fate for them, and, when they lea&s;t expected it, &s;tunned them with the Blow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trojans</HI> in a general Battle with the <HI>Greeks,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the godlike Valour of their Chiefs, received a dreadful Defeat; the Lo&s;s was &s;o great, on their Side, that the venerable <HI>Priam</HI> found him&s;elf reduced to the
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring a Truce and an Exchange of Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>When <HI>Chalcas,</HI> the Father of <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> heard of this Propo&s;ition, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the Council of War, and earne&s;tly intreated the Princes, that they would &s;uffer <HI>Anterior,</HI> then a Pri&s;oner in their Camp, to be exchanged for <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> his Daughter, whom he had left in <HI>Troy</HI> at his Departure. The <HI>Greek</HI> Princes con&s;ented to his Reque&s;t, and tho&s;e that were named Commi&s;&s;ioners for the <HI>Greeks</HI> with the <HI>Trojans,</HI> were ordered to demand <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> in exchange for <HI>Antenor.</HI></P>
<P>At the Arrival of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Envoys in <HI>Troy,</HI> King <HI>Priam</HI> &s;ummoned a Council to meet, be|fore which they appeared and gave an Account of their Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> was named, the great Heart of <HI>Troilus</HI> &s;unk within him, an a&s;hy Palene&s;s over&s;pread his Face; convul&s;ive &s;hi|verings &s;eized every Limb, and Grief and Rage were painted in his Eyes. With trembling Impatience he waited to hear the Opinion of the Council, revolving, in his di&s;tracted Soul, what he &s;hould do in ca&s;e they gave up <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida.</HI> Love &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that he ought rather to die than &s;uffer <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> to be ravi&s;hed from his Arms; but Rea&s;on repre&s;ented, that it was fit the Charmer of his Soul &s;hould be con&s;ulted, as to her Intentions, ere he proceeded to Ex|tremities, and then, if &s;he approved his firm De&s;ign to keep her, he would defend her
<PB N="76" REF="78">
again&s;t the united Force of all the Powers on Earth. Fain would he &s;ave her Honour, and prevent her Departure; and while his Thoughts were in this Tumult, <HI>Hector,</HI> who had well weighed the <HI>Grecians</HI> Demand, turned to the Envoys, and told them, that <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> was not a Pri&s;oner, and therefore could not be included in the Treaty for Exchange of Pri&s;oners; and tell your Princes, added he, We &s;ell no Wo|men here.</P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered the&s;e Words, when a Murmur of Di&s;like ran through the whole A&s;|&s;embly, which at la&s;t broke out into a tumul|tuous Exclamation again&s;t <HI>Hector</HI> for oppo&s;ing the Return of <HI>Antenor</HI> on account of a Wo|man.</P>
<P>The venerable <HI>Priam,</HI> by his Authority, put an End to the Conte&s;t; and, declaring that it was his Will the Daughter of <HI>Calchas</HI> &s;hould be exchanged for <HI>Antenor,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly broke up &s;atisfied with this determination.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> impatient of the &s;mothered Grief and Rage that tore his inmo&s;t Soul, ha&s;tened to his own Palace; with a frantic Air he flew to his Apartment, &s;hut every Door and Window, and having, as much as lay in his Power, ex|cluded the hateful Light, he threw him&s;elf, with a deep and deadly Groan, upon his Bed; there, giving a Loo&s;e to Sorrow, he pa&s;&s;ionately up|braided the cruel Gods as Authors of his Mi&s;|fortunes; he cur&s;ed his Fate, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> him&s;|elf, and <HI>Troy:</HI> Then, in the fierce&s;t Tran&s;|port of his Grief, he threw his groveling Body
<PB N="77" REF="79">
on the Ground; with cruel Blows he beat his groaning Brea&s;t, tore his dis&s;heveled Hair, and abandoned him&s;elf to all the wild Exce&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t confirmed De&s;pair.</P>
<P>The&s;e Agonies at length &s;ub&s;iding, a Calm of Grief en&s;ued; again he fell extended on his Bed, and, in fa&s;t heaving Sighs and &s;treaming Tears, gave Vent to the Angui&s;h of his la|bouring Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus</HI> entering his Chamber, and finding him in this Condition, endeavoured, by all the &s;oothing Arts he was Ma&s;ter of, to give him Comfort; but <HI>Troilus</HI> was deaf to his Per&s;ua|&s;ions, and exa&s;perated rather than &s;oothed by the ineffectual Arguments he urged; again his Grief ro&s;e up to Frenzy; again he uttered Im|precations again&s;t the Gods, and, in the Wild|ne&s;s of his Woe, devoted him&s;elf to De&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> terrified at a De&s;pair &s;o vehe|ment, threw him&s;elf at his Feet, and conjured him to moderate his Affliction, and take no Re&s;olutions to his own Prejudice till he had con&s;ulted <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and heard what &s;he had to propo&s;e; adding, that he would go immedi|ately to his Niece, and take Order for their private Interview.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus</HI> li&s;tened attentively to this Propo&s;al, and, a little &s;oothed with the Hopes of &s;eeing <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Pandarus</HI> to go that In&s;tant and prepare her to receive him, promi&s;ing his
<PB N="78" REF="80">
Confidant to commit no Violence again&s;t him|&s;elf, but to acquie&s;ce patiently in what his Mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;hould ordain for him.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus</HI> &s;atisfied with this A&s;&s;urance, left him, and went to his Niece's Hou&s;e. The Report of her being exchanged for <HI>Antenor</HI> had already reached her Ears. She was reclined on a Couch in her Chamber, pale, motionle&s;s, and bathed in Tears. At her Uncle's Approach &s;he newly rai&s;ed her Head, a fre&s;h Stream of Tears gu&s;hed from her charming Eyes, and pa&s;|&s;ionately cla&s;ping her ivory Hands together, "Oh! Uncle, cried &s;he, with a Voice almo&s;t drowned in thick &s;ucceeding Sighs, to what Mi|&s;ery hath Love and you introduced me!"</P>
<P>Grief prevented her from &s;peaking more; her beauteous Head, like a Lilly overcharged with Rain, &s;unk again upon her Pillow, and a Groan, that &s;eemed to rend her lovely Frame to Pieces, &s;poke her Di&s;tre&s;s more elo|quently than the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Words could do.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus</HI> &s;eating him&s;elf near her, be&s;ought her, for her Lovers &s;ake, who&s;e Grief had almo&s;t deprived him of Rea&s;on, to moderate her Sorrow, and give him an Example of Pa|tience and Con&s;tancy that might, by inciting him to imitate it, prevent the fatal Effects of his De&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> alarmed for her Lover's Safety, and &s;uffering more in his Affliction than her own,

&s;ummoned up all her Courage in Order to receive him with &s;ome Degree of Con&s;tancy. On his Entrance into her Chamber &s;he ro&s;e and met him with an eager Embrace, endea|vouring, by a forced Serenity in her A&s;pect, to di&s;pel that Cloud of Angui&s;h that &s;addened eve|ry Feature; but alas! her Face, that Image of Paradi&s;e, was pale and wan; the ro&s;y Bloom was fled, the laughing Loves that u&s;ed to play upon each dimpled Cheek was gone; Tears had dimmed the Lu&s;tre of her &s;tarry Eyes, and all the &s;prightly Graces, that decked her every Look and Motion, were lo&s;t in langui&s;hing Dejection.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> &s;tepping a few Paces back, gazed on her for &s;ome Moments in an empha|tic Silence; while the big Sorrow, labouring for a Vent, &s;o totally oppre&s;&s;ed his vital Powers, that, &s;tanding without Sen&s;e or Motion, he looked like the &s;ad Image of De&s;pair: Tears at one In&s;tant gave Relief to both.</P>

&s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> &s;teal with her away from <HI>Troy,</HI> and give up all to Love.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> heard this Propo&s;al with Horror; &s;he loved his Fame; &s;he would not &s;uffer him to &s;acrifice it to her; &s;he repre&s;ented to him the Weakne&s;s and Ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch a Re&s;olution, and deeply vowed never to con&s;ent to any thing that might wound his Honour.

<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> with Heart-breaking Sighs, gave a &s;low and &s;ad A&s;&s;ent to what &s;he had propo&s;ed; but, full of racking Apprehen&s;ions, a thou&s;and Times he begged her to be true. And &s;he, invoking all the cele&s;tial Deities, the Satyrs, Nymphs, and Fawns, and the infernal Gods, imprecated Cur&s;es on her&s;elf if ever &s;he received a &s;econd Love. The Morning was now broke, with &s;peechle&s;s Grief they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"><HI>Troilus</HI> went home to put him&s;elf in a con|dition to attend his beloved <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> to the ap|pointed Place, where &s;he was to be exchanged for <HI>Antenor.</HI> At his return to her Hou&s;e he found <HI>Diomede</HI> one of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Chiefs, with many Attendants waiting her coming out. The unhappy Lover could hardly prevent the mingled Rage and Grief that took Po&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul at this Sight, from breaking into &s;ome Act of Violence again&s;t the Man that was going to rob him of all his Soul held dear. But mindful of the &s;acred Truce, and more of his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>'s Honour, he repre&s;&s;ed the ri&s;ing Fury, nor gave the &s;mothered Angui&s;h leave to vent it&s;elf in Sighs. This painful Re&s;traint la&s;ted not long; the beautious <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> appear|ed, and &s;aluting <HI>Diomede</HI> with a langui&s;hing Sweetne&s;s, &s;he gave her Hand to <HI>Troilus</HI>; who having helped her on her Hor&s;e they rode apart from the re&s;t of the Company, and poured out their Souls in mutual prote&s;tations of eternal Love and Fidelity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> with <HI>Antenor,</HI> appearing in &s;ight, <HI>Troilus</HI> was obliged to yield to the &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity of parting. Remember, oh! re|member to be true, he cried, and keep your appointed Day. His faultering Tongue could pronounce no more. An a&s;hy Palene&s;s over|&s;pread his Face; he turned away abruptly and joined <HI>Antenor,</HI> while <HI>Diomede</HI> eagerly flew to the weeping <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and conducting her to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, left her in the Embraces of her Father. The unhappy <HI>Troilus</HI> &s;inking un|der
<PB N="82" REF="84">
the Weight of an un&s;upportable Sorrow, returned to <HI>Troy</HI> unable to endure the Sight or Conver&s;ation of any of his Friends; he gave him&s;elf wholly up to Solitude and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>The ten Days in which &s;he had promi&s;ed to come back, &s;eemed, to his impatient Mind, as many tedious Ages; anxiou&s;ly he counted the tardy Hours, and wondered at their un|u&s;ual Length; now eagerly wi&s;hing for the Shades of Night, and now as impatient for the ri&s;ing Dawn.</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> whom only he would admit to his Pre&s;ence, endeavoured to prevail upon him to bear the Ab&s;ence of his Niece with Mode|ration, and to wait calmly for her Return; but the di&s;tracted Lover was incapable of follow|ing this Advice; his Soul was racked between the contrary Extremes of Hope and Fear; &s;carce were four Days of the de&s;tined Ten elap&s;ed when, wild with Impatience, he rode to the Place where &s;he had appointed to meet him; there &s;topping, he ca&s;t his wi&s;hing Eyes around, as if he expected to &s;ee her; and be|ing di&s;appointed, returned with langui&s;hing Dejection to his Palace, and wore away the Night in Sighs and Tears.</P>
<P>At length the appointed Day came; with fear-check'd Tran&s;port he traced the well-known Path, &s;ending his longing Eyes be|fore to hail the wi&s;hed Appearance of his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>; and now the whi&s;pering Bu&s;hes, and fleeting Shadows at a Di&s;tance, would
<PB N="83" REF="85">
cheat his Ears and Eyes with her Approach; then would he pa&s;&s;ionately fold his Arms, as if already they inclo&s;ed her, and with an exulting Voice cry out to <HI>Pandarus,</HI> She comes, my Friend, &s;he comes, dear, lovely, faithful <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> oh how &s;hall I repay &s;uch wonderous Truth! But when Expectation was wearied by Delay, and no <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> appear|ed to confirm the flattering Hope, then would he &s;ink into a tender De&s;pondency, and chide her Slowne&s;s with a Lover's Anger, which &s;ome new a&s;piring Hope again removed, and gave him up to eager Expectation again to be followed by Di&s;appointment and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>The whole Day being pa&s;t in this continued Succe&s;&s;ion of Hopes and Fears, the Approach of Night brought with it a &s;ad Addition to his Grief; for having no longer any Probability of &s;eeing his beloved <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> he re&s;igned him&s;elf up to the mo&s;t cruel Apprehen&s;ions; ah! with|out doubt &s;he is fal&s;e, he cried, the wretched <HI>Troilus</HI> is no more her Care! what have I to do but die, my <HI>Pandarus,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> has for&s;aken me?</P>
<P><HI>Pandarus,</HI> tho' greatly &s;urprized at his Niece's Breach of Promi&s;e, and perhaps &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, yet anxious to remove from the unhap|py Youth that Load of Angui&s;h that &s;eemed ready to overwhelm him, invented a hundred Excu&s;es for her Delay; which he who dread|ed nothing &s;o much as a Confirmation of her Fal&s;hood, eagerly gra&s;ped at, and, in Com|pliance with the pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances of his Friend,
<PB N="84" REF="86">
returned to the City. After a Night of ago|nizing Woe, no &s;ooner did the Morning dawn than he aro&s;e, and flew again to the appointed Place, hoping, and anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hing, he had mi&s;taken the Day on which his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> had promi&s;ed to meet him; for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Days did he continue this Practice, living all the while in &s;uch a Whirl of contrary Pa&s;&s;ions, as drove him almo&s;t to Frenzy.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> who&s;e Violence of Grief had long ago &s;ub&s;ided, and left only a gentle Sen&s;ibility in her Soul, that but di&s;|po&s;ed it for new Impre&s;&s;ions, having found &s;ome Difficulty in pro&s;ecuting her De&s;ign of returning to <HI>Troy</HI> on the appointed Day, re|&s;olved to lay a&s;ide all Thoughts of &s;uch a dan|gerous Enterpri&s;e, and began to li&s;ten favour|ably to the Vows of <HI>Diomede:</HI> This young Warrior, who&s;e Heart the Sight of her in <HI>Troy</HI> had enflamed, made U&s;e of all the plea&s;ing Arts with which the God of Love in&s;pires his Votaries, to engage her to return his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> at fir&s;t would melt into Tears, mur|mur the Name of <HI>Troy</HI> with a Sigh, and faintly own &s;he had a Lover there who claimed a Right to her Affection. But the gallant Son of <HI>Tydieus</HI> was not &s;o repul&s;ed; well did he know the changing Sex, and how weak an Ob&s;tacle an ab&s;ent Lover was; to tho&s;e faint Remembran|ces he oppo&s;ed his Royal Birth, his Fame in Arms, his never-dying Pa&s;&s;ion, flattering her Ambition with the Hopes of making her his Queen, and her Vanity with an A&s;&s;urance that
<PB N="85" REF="87">
&s;he only could have &s;ubdued his Heart. He re|pre&s;ented to her the certain De&s;truction that hung over <HI>Troy,</HI> and the little Probability there was of her being happy with a Lover of that devoted City.</P>
<P>The ungrateful <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> influenced by the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h Motives, forgot, or did not regard, her Vows of everla&s;ting Faith to <HI>Troilus,</HI> and charmed with the Per&s;on, Valour, and exalted Dignity of her new Adorer, yielded, at length, to his Sollicitations; nor was the in&s;ulting <HI>Greek</HI> &s;atisfied with thus triumphing in &s;ecret over his unhappy Rival: A rich Jewel which <HI>Troilus</HI> had given to <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> at parting, and the abandoned Fair had now be&s;towed on <HI>Dio|mede,</HI> he wore upon his Armour in the Battle, as a Trophy of his Victory, and the <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince's Di&s;grace.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus,</HI> &s;till pining with De&s;ire, and for&s;aken as he was by <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> yet not capable of think|ing her fal&s;e, nouri&s;hed the fatal Flame that preyed upon his Heart, with vain delu&s;ive Hopes of her return; which though every &s;uc|ceeding Day proved to be ill-grounded, yet fond of the deceit he &s;till hoped on, and, like a drowning Wretch, gra&s;ped eagerly at every faint Relief, to avoid that Death which was, notwith&s;tanding, inevitable.</P>
<P>Leaning anxiou&s;ly one Day over the Walls of the City, from whence he &s;ent many a longing Look towards the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, and breathed Heart-breaking Sighs at the Remem|brance
<PB N="86" REF="88">
of his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> he &s;aw a Coat of Mail carried in Triumph before his Brother <HI>Dei|phobas,</HI> as he was returning from the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>This Sight would have had but little Effect on the Heart of the now inglorious Youth, &s;unk as he was in the &s;oft Lethargy of Love, con&s;um|ing away with fruitle&s;s Wi&s;hes, and langui&s;h|ing with di&s;appointed Hope, but a Jewel that blazed upon its Sleeve was no &s;ooner ob&s;erved than it claimed all his Attention; the Shape and Size, recalling to his Mind the Pledge he gave his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> at parting. With trembling Impatience, he fixed his eager Eyes upon it, his Heart took the alarm and beat as if it would have left his Brea&s;t; cold Damps bedewed his &s;hivering Limbs, a mortal Palene&s;s over&s;pread his Face; yet &s;till in&s;atiate of the Sight, he gazed and trembling prayed it might not be what he feared; at length a near Approach put it pa&s;t a doubt that it was the &s;ame Jewel, that, wet with his Tears, and hallowed by a thou&s;and tender Invocations he had given his <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> at the &s;ad Moment of their parting; thunder&s;truck at this Conviction of her Fal&s;hood, wildly he rai&s;ed his haggard Eyes to Heaven, then &s;triking with his Hands his groaning Brea&s;t, "Oh! <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> he cried, where, where is now thy Faith?"</P>
<P>Fixed, for a while, he &s;tood in &s;ilent &s;ad De|&s;pair; then &s;uddenly, looking up he demanded of &s;ome of the Soldiers, who&s;e Armour that was which his Brother <HI>Deiphobas</HI> had won; they
<PB N="87" REF="89">
replied, it was <HI>Diomedes.</HI> Grief giving way to Fury at the Sound of that dete&s;ted Name, he ran tran&s;ported with a De&s;ire of Vengeance to his Palace; there, arming him&s;elf with a tu|multuous Ha&s;te, he ru&s;hed into the Field, and, with loud Cries, called upon <HI>Diomede</HI>; &s;eeking his Rival amid&s;t the thicke&s;t ranks of his Foes, madly he raged about the ho&s;tile Field, provoking Death, and &s;acrificing whole Hecatombs of &s;laughtered <HI>Greeks</HI> to his Re|venge; Rage and De&s;pair rekindling all his martial Heat, &s;ent him each Day with more than mortal Courage to the Fight.</P>
<P>Pale <HI>Greece</HI> with horror beheld the matchle&s;s Chief thinning their Ranks, and driving whole Squadrons before his conquering Sword, but <HI>Diomede</HI> the partial Gods denied to his Re|venge.

<P>The Story of this Play is partly taken from <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Poem of <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and

partly from an old Story Book, called <HI>The three De&s;tructions of</HI> Troy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t furni&s;hed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with the Love Plot, and the &s;econd with all the Incidents that relate to the War.</P>
<P>This Play has been &s;everely cen&s;ured on ac|count of the Faults of its Plot (if that can be called a Plot which is only a Succe&s;&s;ion of In|cidents, without Order, Connexion, or any Dependance upon each other) as well as the Inequality of the Manners the Poet has given to his Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Loves of <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> are, in all the Circum&s;tances, exactly copied from <HI>Chau|cer</HI>; but the&s;e Circum&s;tances are intirely de|tached from the re&s;t of the Play, and produce no Event worthy our Attention.</P>
<P><HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> give Name to the Tra|gedy, and, by Con&s;equence, are the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Per&s;ons in it; yet <HI>Troilus</HI> is left alive, and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> too &s;candalous a Character to draw our Pity, does not &s;atisfy that Dete&s;ta|tion her Crimes rai&s;e in us by her Death, but e&s;caping Puni&s;hment, leaves the Play without a Moral, and ab&s;olutely deficient in poetical Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Manners of the&s;e two Per&s;ons, how|ever, ought to e&s;cape the general Charge of Inequality.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94"><HI>Troilus,</HI> who is drawn exactly after <HI>Chaucer,</HI> is every where con&s;i&s;tent with his Character of a brave Soldier, and a pa&s;&s;ionate and faith|ful Lover.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>'s fir&s;t and &s;econd Appearance we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s what her future Conduct will be; the deep Art with which &s;he con|ceals her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Troilus,</HI> her loo&s;e Con|ver&s;ation with her Uncle, her free Coquettry with the Prince, and her ea&s;y yielding to his Addre&s;&s;es, prepare us for her Fal&s;hood in the &s;ucceeding Part of the Play, and all together make up the Character of a compleat Jilt: Her not being puni&s;hed is indeed an unpardon|able Fault, and brings the greate&s;t Imputation imaginable upon <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Judgment, who could introduce &s;o vicious a Per&s;on in a Tra|gedy, and leave her without the due Reward of her Crimes.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> is much more con&s;i&s;tent in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> than <HI>Chaucer</HI>; the lat|ter repre&s;ents her wi&s;e, humble, and mode&s;t, nicely &s;en&s;ible of Fame, fond of her Country, not ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of Love, hard to be won, and rather betrayed than yielding to the De|&s;ires of her Lover.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e amiable Qualities to engage our E&s;teem and tho&s;e alleviating Circum&s;tan|ces that attended her Fall with <HI>Troilus,</HI> we cannot, without Surprize, &s;ee her &s;o &s;oon changing her Love, violating her Vows, and
<PB N="94" REF="95">
ba&s;ely pro&s;tituting her Honour to <HI>Diomede.</HI> The inequality of Manners here is very ob|&s;ervable; but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in drawing her Cha|racter has avoided falling into the &s;ame Fault by copying <HI>Chaucer</HI> too clo&s;ely, and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> throughout the Play, is always equal and con|&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the old Story Book, called <HI>The three De&s;tructions of</HI> Troy, furni&s;hed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with the other Part of the Plot, is plain from &s;everal of the Incidents being exactly copied from thence: Thus he makes <HI>Achilles</HI> to be in Love with <HI>Polyxena</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Priam,</HI> and this Pa&s;&s;ion to be the Cau&s;e of his refu&s;ing to fight again&s;t the <HI>Trojans</HI>; and <HI>Hector</HI> to be cowardly killed by <HI>Achilles,</HI> as he was intent on &s;poiling a <HI>Greek</HI> of his Golden Armour, which he had eagerly &s;ought after in the Battle.</P>
<P>This Circum&s;tance, however, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has altered greatly for the wor&s;e: The Story &s;ays, that <HI>Hector</HI> having &s;lain <HI>Patroclus</HI> and performed many wonderful Acts of Valour, &s;atisfied with the Slaughters of the Day, was going to quit the Field, when happening to &s;ee a <HI>Greek</HI> with a compleat Suit of Golden Armour on, his Avarice was awakened and he re&s;olved not to quit the Battle till he had gained this rich Prize; accordingly he a&s;&s;ault|ed the <HI>Greek,</HI> took him Pri&s;oner, and to lead him more ea&s;ily out of the Throng, ca&s;t his Shield behind him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96"><HI>Achilles,</HI> whom the Death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> had brought into the Field, burning with a De&s;ire of Revenge on <HI>Hector,</HI> ha&s;tened to &s;eize him at this Di&s;advantage, and gave him a Blow with his Spear which killed him.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes <HI>Hector,</HI> in the &s;ame Man|ner, eager to win this Suit of Armour; but after he has &s;lain the <HI>Greek</HI> who owned it, he di&s;arms him&s;elf in the Field of Battle, and <HI>Achilles</HI> and his Myrmidons coming up, they all &s;urround him, fall upon him and kill him.</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> made <HI>Achilles</HI> a greater Coward than the old Story Writer; for in the latter he only takes Advantage of his Enemy's Shield being thrown behind him to give him a Wound; but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes him employ all his Myrmidons to kill one Man, and he di&s;|armed and calling for Mercy.</P>
<P>The Ab&s;urdity of <HI>Hector</HI>'s unarming him|&s;elf in the Field of Battle, with all his Foes about him, in order to facilitate this wonderful Enterprize, is too gro&s;s to need any Remark.</P>
<P><HI>Hector</HI>'s challenging any of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princes to &s;ingle Combat, in Honour of their Ladies Beauty, is a Circum&s;tance borrowed from the Story Book, but &s;urely very injudi|ciou&s;ly. The following Me&s;&s;age from the De|fender of <HI>Troy,</HI> a City almo&s;t ruined by a War of nine Years Continuance, can hardly be read without a Smile.</P>

<L>The Splinter of a Lance,&mdash;even &s;o much.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> begins with telling the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princes that, in <HI>Troy,</HI> they have a Prince called <HI>Hector,</HI> and that <HI>Priam</HI> is his Father, as if the Name and Quality of this redoubted Hero, the Bul|wark
<PB N="97" REF="98">
of the <HI>Trojans</HI> and the Terror of the <HI>Gre|cians,</HI> could be unknown to them.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in this Pa&s;&s;age, contradicts him|&s;elf as well as Common-&s;en&s;e; for we find afterwards, that they acknowledged the Valour of <HI>Hector</HI> to be &s;o great that none but <HI>Achilles</HI> was thought an equal Match for him, and <HI>Ajax</HI> was urged to accept the Challenge, in order to rai&s;e the Jealou&s;y of the di&s;con|tented <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> al&s;o tells them, that their Champion is grown ru&s;ty during the dull and long conti|nued Truce; yet, in the foregoing Scene, the <HI>Trojan</HI> Heroes are repre&s;ented returning from the Battle, and, after that, we find no mention of a Truce, or any Interval allowed to make it be &s;uppo&s;ed there had been one: How then comes it that <HI>Aeneas</HI> here &s;peaks of a Truce? But the&s;e Blunders are very frequent in <HI>Shake|&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet likewi&s;e, following the old Story Writer, makes <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Ajax</HI> Cou&s;in-Ger|mans; but in the Play, <HI>Ajax,</HI> as it would &s;eem, knows nothing of the Matter till he is told of it, fir&s;t by <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Hector</HI>; and then, when the Combat is ended, the two Heroes Embrace, and 'tis nothing but Cou&s;in and Cou&s;in, at every Word.</P>
<P>The Story tells us, that <HI>Achilles</HI> had a long|ing De&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Hector</HI> unarmed; <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="99">
makes u&s;e of this Thought, <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;ays, in the Play, to his Friend,
<Q><L>&mdash; &mdash; I have a Woman's Longing,</L>
<L>An Appetite that I am &s;ick withal,</L>
<L>To &s;ee great <HI>Hector</HI> in the Weeds of Peace.</L></Q>
The Conver&s;ation of the&s;e two Heroes, when they meet, which con&s;i&s;ts of mutual Threat|nings, doubtle&s;s gave <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> the Hint for that characteri&s;tic Di&s;cour&s;e they hold together in the Play.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> con&s;ulted this Book for Part of his Plot, yet, in drawing the Characters of his <HI>Grecian</HI> Princes, I cannot help thinking he had <HI>Homer</HI> in his Eye; and probably &s;aw &s;ome old Tran&s;lation of that Poet, for there was one in his Time.</P>
<P><HI>Achilles,</HI> indeed, is a Character of his own Invention, ridiculous and incon&s;tant to the la&s;t Degree, Brave, and a Coward; a Fool, yet a deep and accurate Rea&s;oner: But, in the others, he &s;eems to have endeavoured at an Imitation of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he makes <HI>Diomede</HI> bold and enterpriz|ing; <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> wi&s;e and artful; <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> narrative, and ever ready to expatiate on his pa&s;t Exploits; <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> cowardly, &s;atyrical, witty, and ma|licious: In the Interview between the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Trojan</HI> Princes, he makes them all &s;peak with great Propriety, and &s;uitable to their re|&s;pective Characters. <HI>Hector,</HI> indeed, by men|tioning
<PB N="99" REF="100">
<HI>Helen,</HI> ludicrou&s;ly to the injured <HI>Mene|laas,</HI> who had given him a free and &s;oldier-like Greeting, di&s;covers, in that In&s;tance, neither the Manners of a Prince or Warrior; but this is only a Slip; for his Di&s;cour&s;e, both be|fore and after it, is quite agreeable to his Cha|racter.</P>
<P>The Silence of <HI>Troilus</HI> in this Scene is beau|tifully imagined. The Poet makes this pa&s;|&s;ionate Prince attend <HI>Hector</HI> to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Tents, whither he is invited only with a De&s;ign of &s;eeing his beloved <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI>; but his Re&s;ent|ment towards the Enemies of his Country be|ing heightened by the Con&s;ideration of their having deprived him of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he is incapable of mixing in the Conver&s;ation, or even of returning the Civilities of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princes; he &s;tands at a Di&s;tance, pen&s;ive, &s;i|lent, wholly ab&s;orb'd in melancholly Reflections. The Grief of this young Lover is finely mark|ed by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> in that &s;hort Que&s;tion to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> pointing him out.</P>
<Q>What <HI>Trojan</HI> is that &s;ame that looks &s;o heavy?</Q>
<P>However ridiculous, incon&s;i&s;tent, and con|trary to general Opinion, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has drawn the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this Play; yet, in the following Lines he mu&s;t have had <HI>Homer</HI> in his View. The <HI>Grecian</HI> Army is almo&s;t rout|ed by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> the Commanders in the ut|mo&s;t Con&s;ternation, when <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> enters, and thus rea&s;&s;ures them:
<Q><PB N="100" REF="101">
<L>Oh Courage, Courage, Princes! great <HI>Achilles</HI></L>
<L>Is arming, weeping, cur&s;ing, vowing Ven|geance!</L>
<L><HI>Patroclus'</HI> Wounds have rous'd his drou&s;y Blood.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Achilles</HI> is made of &s;o much Import|ance to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> that, vanqui&s;hed as they were, and flying from the Field, they no &s;ooner heard that <HI>Achilles</HI> is arming, and coming to join them, than their Courage is reanimated; they renew the Fight, and Victory declares for them. Only <HI>Homer</HI> could have furni&s;hed <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> with this Thought, nor with an Idea of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Grief for the Death of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> which in two Lines he has &s;o pathetically de|&s;cribed. The old Story which, in many Places he has faithfully copied, is ab&s;olutely &s;ilent here.</P>

<P>The Character of <HI>Pandarus,</HI> al&s;o, is bor|rowed from him, but much heightened by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>: Part of the Conver&s;ation be|tween <HI>Pandarus</HI> and his Niece is copied exactly from <HI>Chaucer.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PLAN OF King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second.</HEAD>
<P>THE Action of this Play begins with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s appealing the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> on an Accu&s;ation of High Trea&s;on: The King, after having in vain at|tempted to reconcile them, permits them, ac|cording to the Cu&s;tom of that Time, to de|cide the Conte&s;t with their Swords.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed, the King and his Nobles being &s;eated in the Li&s;ts, the two Champions appear in Armour, and the King, &s;uddenly throwing down his Warder, forbids the Combat, and pronounces a Sentence of Bani&s;hment on both; but with this Difference, that <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> &s;hould remain in Exile during ten Years, four of which he afterwards remits, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of his Father <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI>;
<PB N="102" REF="103">
but the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> he commands, on Pain of Death, never to return.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> dying &s;oon after, the King &s;eizes his Plate, Money and Lands, to furni&s;h Nece&s;&s;aries for the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> War, in which he was then engaged; and, &s;etting &s;ail for <HI>Ireland,</HI> leaves his Kingdom in great Confu&s;ion. The King's injurious Treatment of the bani&s;hed <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> by thus depriving him of his legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, draws great Numbers to that Noble|man's Party, who being a&s;&s;i&s;ted likewi&s;e by a foreign Force, lands in <HI>England,</HI> and there de|claring, that his only Motives for returning to his native Country in Arms, were to get his unde&s;erved Bani&s;hment repealed; to require the Re&s;titution of tho&s;e Goods of which he had been unju&s;tly deprived, and to claim the Duke|dom of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> de&s;cended to him by the Death of his Father; he is joined by all the di&s;affected Nobility.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> his Uncle, and Guardian of the Realm in the King's Ab&s;ence, having no Forces to oppo&s;e him, and con&s;cious of the Wrongs he had &s;uffered, remains neuter.</P>
<P>The King returns, and falling into the Hands of <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> is carried to <HI>London,</HI> prevailed upon to re&s;ign his Crown, and after|wards confined in <HI>Pomfret</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Aumarle,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the Abbot of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and &s;ome other Lords, join in a Con|&s;piracy

<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in his Hi&s;torical Plays, was a clo&s;e Copier of the Hi&s;tories from whence he took them; yet, in <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, there are &s;ome Deviations and &s;ome Omi&s;&s;ions that throw different Lights on the Characters of his Per&s;ons, and tend greatly to mi&s;lead our Judgments in the Opinions we Form of them.</P>
<P>The Murder of the Duke, of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> Uncle to the King, is one of the Crimes that <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> charges on the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; the King, in many Pa&s;&s;ages of the Play, is &s;aid to have commanded it: The old Duke of <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter</HI> upbraids him with having &s;hed the Blood of the great <HI>Edward,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI>'s Silence to that Accu&s;ation is not only a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion of the Guilt, but a Proof that he had nothing to offer in Vindication of it.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">In the Hi&s;tory it is not ab&s;olutely clear that King <HI>Richard</HI> had any part in the Death of his Uncle; but 'tis certain that the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> was engaged in &s;everal Con&s;piracies again&s;t him, and that the King having di&s;co|vered a dangerous One, in which not only his Crown and Dignity but his Life was aimed at, he found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eizing his di&s;loyal Uncle; which he did by a well con|trived Stratagem at his own Ca&s;tle, and &s;ent him to <HI>Calais</HI>; where he confe&s;&s;ed all his Trea|&s;ons, and was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, as &s;ome Report, by <HI>Richard</HI>'s Order.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Silence, upon this Head, is very unfavourable to the Character of <HI>Richard,</HI> on whom, by that Means, he draws the Im|putation of a Murderer and Paracide; and yet, in his Misfortunes, he propo&s;es him as an Ob|ject of Compa&s;&s;ion, and makes U&s;e of all his pathetic Powers to melt the Souls of the Audi|ence in his Favour.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torians &s;ay that <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> when in Bani&s;hment, was invited by the chief No|bility in <HI>England</HI> to return and force the Crown from <HI>Richard,</HI> whom they judged unworthy to Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> takes no Notice of this Circum|&s;tance, but makes <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> on his Arrival, declare that he only came to demand a Re&s;titu|tion of the Honours and E&s;tates he had been
<PB N="108" REF="109">
unju&s;tly deprived of; and the Lords join him upon this Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the Hi&s;tory we are told, that King <HI>Richard,</HI> finding him&s;elf abandoned by many of his Friends, his <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Army, on whom he had the greate&s;t Confidence, di&s;per&s;ed, and <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of his People's Hearts, retired to <HI>Conway</HI> Ca&s;tle, which he determined to hold as long as it was po&s;&s;ible; thither the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> came from <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> with Offers of Submi&s;&s;ion, on his Part, provided the King would pardon what was pa&s;t, repeal his Bani&s;hment, and re&s;tore him to all his Rights and Dignities.</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard,</HI> being per&s;uaded to accept of the&s;e Conditions, and to go to <HI>Rutland</HI> to con|fer with <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> falls into an Ambu&s;h pre|pared for him, and is led Pri&s;oner to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> drops the Circum&s;tance of the Ambu&s;h laid for the King, and repre&s;ents <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> confering in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Manner with him at <HI>Flint</HI> Ca&s;tle; and the King, upon his Cou&s;in's &s;olemn A&s;&s;urance of attempting nothing again&s;t his Crown and Dignity, wil|lingly accompanies him to <HI>London,</HI> where, at a meeting of the Parliament, he is depo&s;ed and the Crown offered to <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<P>This Play affords &s;everal other In&s;tances in which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Inattention to the Hi&s;tory is plainly proved; and is therefore the le&s;s par|donable, as the Subject of it is not one entire

<P>The Manner of <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s appealing the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the Order of the intended Combat, the very Words of the Appellant and Defendant, the Behaviour and Speech of the King on that Occa&s;ion, are exactly copied from <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> as is likewi&s;e the Appeals of the Lords in the fir&s;t Scene of the fourth Act.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Conduct, throughout the Play, is the &s;ame as the Hi&s;tory repre&s;ents it; only <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has aggravated his Zeal to the new-made King, by introducing him ea|ger and &s;olicitous to procure the Death of his Son <HI>Aumarle,</HI> for having engaged in a Con&s;pi|racy again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Impropriety of making a Father pre&s;s &s;o ardently the Execution of a beloved Son, becau&s;e that Son had joined with a Party that had re&s;olved to dethrone an U&s;urper, and re|&s;tore the lawful King, is too glaring to need any Animadver&s;ion: But, becau&s;e there is &s;ome|thing truly ludicrous in this very tragical Pa&s;|&s;age, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe it.</P>

<P>In the &s;econd Act, &s;he is informed of <HI>Bo|lingbroke</HI>'s Inva&s;ion, and the Di&s;&s;affection of almo&s;t all the Nobility; and in the fourth, this &s;orrowful Queen is introduced in her Gar|den with two Ladies, who pre&s;s her to dance.</P>

<P>The Manner of King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Death is differently related by the Hi&s;torians. <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> follows <HI>Thomas Wal&s;ingham</HI>'s Account of that barbarous Parricide, as quoted by <HI>Holing|&s;hed</HI>; how clo&s;ely he has copied the Circum|&s;tances, and even &s;ome of the Speeches, may be &s;een by comparing the Pa&s;&s;ages as they &s;tand in the Hi&s;torian and Poet.</P>
<P>"One Writer, &s;ays <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> Page 517, which &s;eemeth to have great Knowledge of King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Doings, &s;aith, That King <HI>Hen|ry,</HI> &s;itting one Day at his Table, are &s;ighing, &s;aid, Have I no faithful Friend which will de|liver me of him who&s;e Life will be my Death, and who&s;e Death will be the Pre&s;ervation of my Life.</P>
<P>This Saying was much noted of them which were pre&s;ent, and e&s;pecially of one called Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> of <HI>Exton.</HI> This Knight incontinently departed from the Court, with eight &s;trong Per&s;ons in his Company, and came to <HI>Pomfret,</HI> commanding the E&s;quire that was accu&s;tomed to &s;erve and take the A&s;&s;ay before King <HI>Richard,</HI> to do &s;o no more, &s;aying, Let him eat now, for he &s;hall not long eat.</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard</HI> &s;at down to Dinner, and was &s;erved without Curte&s;y or A&s;&s;ay; whereupon much marvelling at the &s;udden Change, he de|manded
<PB N="117" REF="118">
of the E&s;quire why he did not his Duty? Sir, &s;aid he, I am otherwi&s;e com|manded by Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> of <HI>Exton,</HI> which is new|ly come from King <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>When King <HI>Richard</HI> heard that Word, he took the Carving Knife in his Hand, and &s;truck the E&s;quire on the Head, &s;aying, The Devil take <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and thee to|gether, and with that Word Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> entered the Chamber well armed, with eight tall Men likewi&s;e armed, every one of them having a Bill in his Hand. King <HI>Richard</HI> perceiving this, put the Table from him, and &s;tepping to the foremo&s;t Man, wrung the Bill out of his Hands, and &s;o valiantly defended him&s;elf that he &s;lew four of tho&s;e that thus came to a&s;&s;ail him. Sir <HI>Pierce,</HI> being half di&s;mayed here|with, leaped into the Chair where King <HI>Ri|chard</HI> was wont to &s;it, while the other four Per&s;ons fought with him, and cha&s;ed him about the Chamber; and, in Conclu&s;ion, as King <HI>Richard</HI> traver&s;ed his Ground from one Side of the Chamber to another, and coming by the Chair where Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> &s;tood, he was felled with a Stroke of a Poll-ax, which Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> gave him upon the Head; and there|with rid him out of Life, without giving him Re&s;pite once to call to God for Mercy of his pa&s;t Offences.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that Sir <HI>Pierce</HI> of <HI>Exton,</HI> after he had thus &s;lain him, wept right bitterly, as one &s;tricken with the Prick of a guilty Con&s;cience

<P>The King &s;ends to treat with the Rebels; <HI>Piercy,</HI> being di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to an Accom|modation, Commi&s;&s;ions his Uncle, the Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> to propo&s;e Terms to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> out of an Opinion that <HI>Henry</HI> could never be thoroughly reconciled to them, and would take an other Opportunity to be revenged, treacherou&s;ly conceals the King's favourable Offers, and tells <HI>Piercy</HI> that he is re&s;olved to fight.</P>
<P>Then follows the Battle, in which, the brave <HI>Piercy</HI> is &s;lain by the wild Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> The King's Party is victorious; the treache|rous <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> being made Pri&s;oner, is con|demned to die, and the King, dividing his Forces, &s;ends one Part, under the Command of his &s;econd Son, to meet the Earl of <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> at <HI>York</HI>; and him&s;elf and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> march again&s;t the Rebel <HI>Glendower</HI> and the Earl of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The Tran&s;actions contained in this Hi&s;tori|cal Drama, are comprized in the Space of ten Months.

The Epi|&s;odical Part of the Drama, which is made up of the extravagant Sallies of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the inimitable Humour of <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> is entirely of his own Invention. The Cha|racter of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> tho' drawn after the Hi&s;torians, is con&s;iderably improved by <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>; and through the Veil of his Vices and Irregularities, we &s;ee a Dawn of Greatne&s;s and Virtue, that promi&s;es the future Splendor of his Life and Reign.</P>
<P>The Poet has indeed deviated from Hi&s;tory, in making this young Prince kill the gallant <HI>Piercy</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Shrew&s;bury.</HI> Accord|ing to them it is uncertain by whom he fell; however this Circum&s;tance is beautifully ima|gined by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in order to exalt the Cha|racter of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> which had before been ob&s;cured by the Glory of that Heroe.</P>

<P>The Hi&s;torian &s;ays, Page 553, that a little Time before the Battle of <HI>Agincourt</HI> was fought, King <HI>Henry</HI> overheard a Soldier &s;ay to his Fel|low: <Q>I would to God there were with us now &s;o many good Soldiers as are at this Hour within <HI>England.</HI></Q> To which the King replied: <Q>I would not wi&s;h a Man more here than I have; we are, indeed, in Compari&s;on to the Enemies, but a few; but if God, of his Clemency, do favour us and our ju&s;t Cau&s;e (as I tru&s;t he will) we &s;hall Speed well enough: But let no Man a&s;cribe Vic|tory to our own Strength and Might, but only to God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to whom, I have

<P>There is no Foundation either in <HI>Hall</HI> or <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> for this Circum&s;tance, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> indeed took the out-lines of the Dauphin's Character from the&s;e Hi&s;torians who repre&s;ent him to be a light, arrogant, and vain-glorious Prince; but he has painted at full Length what they only drew in Miniture; and by adding, with great Propriety &s;ome of the Characteri&s;tic Follies of his Nation, given us a lively and humerous Picture of a Coxcomb Prince.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of making the Prince&s;s <HI>Ca|tharine</HI> the only Per&s;on in the <HI>French</HI> Court, who does not under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> has been al|ready taken Notice of: And it mu&s;t be confe&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="137" REF="137">

<P>THE hi&s;torical Tran&s;actions contained in this Play, take in the Compa&s;s of about thirty Years; they are all ex|tracted from <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI>'s Chronicle: But <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in this, as well as in the two fol|lowing Parts of this King's Reign, has not been very exact to the Date and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Facts, &s;huffling them backwards and for|wards, out of the Order of Time in which they happened, as it be&s;t &s;uited his Purpo&s;e. The Characters are almo&s;t all faithfully copied from the Hi&s;torian; but the Poet has exagge|rated the Affection of Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> for the Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> repre&s;enting that Prince&s;s as engaged in a criminal Amour with the Duke, for which there is no Foundation in Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>THE Contention between the two Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> furni&s;hes the Incidents which compo&s;e this Play. The Action begins with King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Mar|riage, which was in the twenty third Year of his Reign, and clo&s;es with the fir&s;t Battle fought at <HI>St. Albans</HI> and won by the <HI>York</HI> Faction, in the thirty third Year of his Reign; &s;o that it takes in the Hi&s;tory and Tran&s;actions of ten Years.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has copied <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> pretty clo&s;e|ly throughout this whole Play, except in his Relation of the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI>'s Death.
<PB N="154" REF="153">
The Chronicle tells us, that King <HI>Henry,</HI> to &s;atisfy the Nobility and People, who hated this Favourite, condemned him to Bani&s;hment during the Space of five Years. In his Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>France</HI> he was taken by a Ship of War belong|ing to the Duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> Con&s;table of the <HI>Tower</HI>; the Captain of which Ship carried him into <HI>Dover</HI> Road, and there &s;truck off his Head on the Side of a Cock-boat.</P>
<P>In <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> he is taken by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pyrates on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding the large Ran&s;om he offers them, re&s;olve to murder him: One of them, in the Cour&s;e of his Conver&s;ation with the Duke, tells him, that his Name is <HI>Walter Whitmore</HI>; and ob&s;erv|ing him &s;tart, a&s;ks him, if he is frighted at Death, to which <HI>Suffolk</HI> replied.</P>
<Q><L>Thy Name affrights me, in who&s;e Sound is Death,</L>
<L>A cunning Man did calculate my Birth,</L>
<L>And told me that by <HI>Walter</HI> I &s;hould die.</L></Q>
<P>This Circum&s;tance is not to be found, either in <HI>Hall</HI> or <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI>; and as it has greatly the Air of Fiction, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> probably bor|rowed it from the &s;ame Tale that furni&s;hed him with the Loves of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and the Queen, on which &s;everal pa&s;&s;ionate Scenes in this Play, as well as the former, are Built.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE and DEATH OF King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Tragedy, tho' it is called the Life and Death of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, takes in, at mo&s;t, but the la&s;t eight Years of his Time. The Scene opens with the Im|pri&s;onment of <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> in the <HI>Tower,</HI> which happened in the beginning of the Year 1477, and clo&s;es with the Death of <HI>Richard</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;worth</HI> Field; which Battle was fought on the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the Year 1485.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torical Facts are all taken from <HI>Hol|ing&s;hed,</HI> and the Characters all clo&s;ely copied from that Author; that of <HI>Richard</HI> the third
<PB N="164" REF="162">
has been cen&s;ured as mon&s;trous, the Picture of a Fiend and not a Man; and too exqui&s;itely wicked to be repre&s;ented on the Stage. 'Tis certain however, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has not ag|gravated the Vices and Cruelty of this Prince; he paints him &s;uch as Hi&s;tory has tran&s;mitted him to us; and if his Character &s;hocks us more in the Scene than the Story, 'tis becau&s;e the Colours of the Poet are more lively, his Expre&s;&s;ion &s;tronger, and the Lights he &s;hews him in more diver&s;ified; but the Subject in both is the &s;ame. The qualities of his Mind and Per&s;on are thus &s;ummed up by <HI>Holing&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>"As he was &s;mall and little of Stature, &s;o was he of Body greatly deformed, the one Shoul|der higher than the other, his Face was &s;mall, but his Countenance cruel, and &s;uch that the fir&s;t A&s;pect a Man would judge it to &s;mell and favour of Malice, Fraud and Deceit; when he &s;tood mu&s;ing, he would bite and chaw his nether Lip; as who &s;aid, that his fierce Nature always chafed, &s;tirred and was ever unquiet: be&s;ide, that the Dagger which he wore, he would (when he &s;tudied) with his Hand pluck up and down in the Sheath to the mid&s;t, never drawing it fullie out. He was of a ready, preg|nant and quick Wit, wielie to feire, and apt to di&s;&s;emble: He had a proud Mind, and an arrogant Stomach, the which accompanied him even to his Death, rather choo&s;ing to &s;uf|fer the &s;ame by dint of Sword, than, being for&s;aken and left helple&s;s of his unfaithful Com|panions, to pre&s;erve by cowardlie Flight, &s;uch a frail and uncertain Life, which by Malice,
<PB N="165" REF="163">
Sickne&s;s, or condigne Puni&s;hment, was like &s;hortly to come to confu&s;ion."</P>
<P>This Character is the very &s;ame with that drawn of him by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>; but the latter is made more &s;triking by the wonderful Propriety of the Manners and Sentiments he every where, throughout the Play, attributes to him. If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is in any In&s;tance to be blamed for keeping too clo&s;e to the Hi&s;torian, it is for dignifying the la&s;t Moments of this bloody Tyrant with &s;uch &s;hining Proofs of Fortitude and Valour, as, notwith&s;tanding the Dete&s;ta|tion we conceived at his cruelties, mu&s;t force from us an involuntary Applau&s;e. The Hi&s;tory tells us he fought bravely in that Battle which decided his Fate, and, overpowered as he was by Numbers, di&s;dained to &s;ave his Life by Flight.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> improves this into the following noble De&s;cription, which has indeed this im|proper Effect, that our hatred of the Tyrant is wholly lo&s;t in our Admiration of the Heroe.</P>

<P>There are &s;everal of <HI>Shake&s;pears</HI> hi&s;torical Plays which take in a greater Compa&s;s of Time than this, but none in which the ab&s;urdity of crowding the Events of many Years into a Repre&s;entation of three Hours, is made &s;o glaring. This, no doubt, is occa&s;ioned by the very unartful Di&s;po&s;ition of the Incidents which, though made up of di&s;tant Events, follow one another without the lea&s;t Preparation, without the Intervention of an Act, or Change of Scene, to give the Spectator's Imagination room to cheat it&s;elf agreeably, by &s;upplying that Di&s;tance of Time nece&s;&s;ary for the giv|ing any Probability to the Story. To be con|vinced of this one need only con&s;ider the Con|duct of the fir&s;t Part of the fourth Act, where <HI>Richard,</HI> for the fir&s;t Time, enters as King, his Nephew Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being &s;till alive: He declares his Appre|hen&s;ions of them to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance he had u&s;urped the Crown,
<PB N="167" REF="165">
and pre&s;&s;es him to give Con&s;ent to their Mur|der.</P>
<P>The Duke demands a Minute's Lei&s;ure to con&s;ider of his Propo&s;al, and goes out; <HI>Ri|chard</HI> immediately a&s;ks his Page, if he can re|commend any Per&s;on to him that will under|take a Murder for Reward; the Page names <HI>Tyrrel,</HI> and goes to fetch him; King <HI>Richard</HI> then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to one of his Confi|dents, &s;ays:
<Q><L>Come hither, <HI>Cate&s;by,</HI> rumour it abroad,</L>
<L>That <HI>Anne</HI> my Wife is &s;ick, and like to die.</L>
<L>I will take Order for her keeping clo&s;e.</L>

<L>Uncertain Way of Gain! But I am in</L>
<L>So far in Blood, that Sin will pluck on Sin.</L>
<L>Tear-falling Pity dwells not in this Eye!</L></Q></P>

there. <HI>Buckingham</HI> then re-enters, and is be|ginning to acquaint <HI>Richard</HI> with his Re&s;olu|tion concerning the Princes, but is &s;topped by the Tyrant, who changes the Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>Buckingham</HI> thereupon demands the Earldom of <HI>Hereford,</HI> which the King had promi&s;ed him; the King makes eva&s;ive An&s;wers, till being hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Duke, he retires, and <HI>Buckingham</HI> declaring he will fly to <HI>Breck|nock,</HI> goes off.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrrel</HI> then enters, and informs the Audi|ence that the two Princes are murdered by <HI>Dighton</HI> and <HI>Forre&s;t,</HI> whom he had &s;uborned to commit this cruel Action; the King coming in, he tells him his Commands had been per|formed; <HI>Richard</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;es him, with a Pro|mi&s;e of Preferment, and then proceeds to give the Audience an Account of what he had done during his Ab&s;ence of two Minutes.</P>

<P>The Divorce of Queen <HI>Catharine</HI> from King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, makes one of the principal Incidents of this Play. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has here &s;o clo&s;ely copied <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> as well in the Facts as the Speeches of the chief Per&s;ons concerned in this Affair, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to tran|&s;cribe the Pa&s;&s;ages both from the Hi&s;torian and Poet, if we would judge of their Similarity.</P>
<P><BIBL><HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> Page 906.</BIBL> "Ye have heard how the People talked a little before the Cardinal's going over into <HI>France</HI> the la&s;t Year, that the King was told by Dr. <HI>Longland,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and others, that his Marriage with Queen <HI>Kath|rine</HI> could not be good nor lawful. The Truth is, that whether this Doubt was fir&s;t moved by the Cardinal, or by the &s;aid <HI>Longland,</HI> be|ing the King's Confe&s;&s;or, the King was not only brought in Doubts, whether it was a lawful Marriage or no; but al&s;o determined to have the Ca&s;e examined, cleered, and adjudged, by Learning, Law, and &s;ufficient Authority. The Cardinal verily was put in mo&s;t Blame for this Scruple now ca&s;t into the King's Con|&s;cience, for the Hate he bore to the Emperor, becau&s;e he would not grant to him the Arch|bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Toledo,</HI> for the which he was a Suiter; and therefore, he did not only pro|cure the King of <HI>England</HI> to join in Friend&s;hip with the <HI>French</HI> King, but al&s;o &s;ought a Di|vorce betwixt the King and Queen, that the
<PB N="182" REF="179">
King might have in Marriage the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Alan&s;on,</HI> Si&s;ter to the <HI>French</HI> King; and (as &s;ome have thought) he travelled in that Mat|ter with the <HI>French</HI> King at <HI>Amiens:</HI> But the Dutche&s;s would not give Ear thereunto.</P>
<P>But how&s;oever it came about, that the King was thus troubled in Con&s;cience concerning his Marriage, this followed, that, like a wi&s;e and &s;age Prince, to have the Doubt clearly removed, he called together the be&s;t learned of the Realm, which were of &s;everal Opinions. Wherefore, he thought to know the Truth by indifferent Judges, le&s;t, peradventure the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> and other al&s;o in favour of the Queen, would &s;ay, that his own Subjects were not in|different Judges in this Behalf; and therefore, he wrote his Cau&s;e to <HI>Rome,</HI> and likewi&s;e &s;ent to all the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and to the great Clerks of all Chri&s;tendome, to know their Opinions, and de&s;ired the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;end into his Realm a Legate, which &s;hould be indifferent and of great and pro|found Judgment, to hear the Cau&s;e debated. At who&s;e Reque&s;t the whole Con&s;i&s;tory of the College of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ent thither <HI>Laurence Cam|peius</HI> a Prie&s;t Cardinal, a Man of great Wit and Experience, which was &s;ent hither before, in the tenth Year of this King, and with him was joined in Commi&s;&s;ion the Cardinal of <HI>York</HI> and Legate of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This Cardinal came to <HI>London</HI> in <HI>October,</HI> and did intimate both to the King and Queen the Cau&s;e of his coming, which being known,
<PB N="183" REF="180">
great Talk was had thereof. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> &s;ent for the famous Doctors of both the Univer&s;ities, to <HI>Lambeth</HI>; and there were every Day Di&s;putations and Communings of this Matter. And becau&s;e the King meant nothing but uprightly therein, and knew that the Queen was &s;omething wedded to her own Opinion, and wi&s;hed that &s;he &s;hould do no|thing without Coun&s;el, he bad her choo&s;e the be&s;t Clerks of his Realme to be of her Coun|cel, and licenced them to do the be&s;t on her Part that they could, according to the Truth. Then &s;he elected <HI>William Warham,</HI> Archbi|&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas We&s;t,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Elie,</HI> Doctors of the Laws; and <HI>John Fi&s;her,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Henry Standi&s;h,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> Doctors of Divinity; and many other Doctors and well-learned Men, which, for Surety, like Men of great Learn|ing, defended her Cau&s;e as far as Learning might maintain and hold it up.</P>
<P>About this time was received into Favour <HI>Stephen Gardiner,</HI> who&s;e Service he u&s;ed in Matters of great Secrecy and Weight, admit|ting him in the room of Dr. <HI>Pace,</HI> the which being continually abroad in Amba&s;&s;ages, and the &s;ame oftentimes not much nece&s;&s;ary, by the Cardinal's Appointment, at length he took &s;uch Grief therewith that he fell out of his right Wits.</P>
<P>The Place where the Cardinals &s;hould &s;it to hear the Cau&s;e of Matrimony betwixt the King and Queen, was at the <HI>Black Friars</HI> in <HI>London</HI>;
<PB N="184" REF="181">
where, in the great Hall was Preparation made of Seats, Tables, and other Furniture, according to &s;uch a &s;olemn Se&s;&s;ion and royal Appearance. The Court was platted in Tables and Benches in manner of a Con&s;i&s;tory, one Seat rai&s;ed higher for the Judges to &s;it in; then, as it were in the mid&s;t of the &s;aid Judges, aloft above them three Degrees high, was a Cloth of State hanged, with a Chair royal un|der the &s;ame, wherein &s;at the King; and be|&s;ide him, &s;ome Di&s;tance from him, &s;at the Queen; and under the Judges Feet &s;at the Scribes and other Officers; the chief Scribe was Dr. <HI>Stevens,</HI> and the Caller of the Court was one <HI>Cooke</HI> of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Then, before the King and Judges, with|in the Court, &s;at the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury, Warham,</HI> and all the other Bi&s;hops. Then &s;tood at both Ends within, the Councellors learned in the &s;piritual Laws, as well the King's as the Queen's. The Doctors of Law for the King had their convenient Rooms: Thus was the Court furni&s;hed. The Judges commanded Silence whil&s;t their Commi&s;&s;ion was read, both to the Court and to the People a&s;&s;embled; that done the Scribes commanded the Crier to call the King by the Name of, <HI>King</HI> Henry <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>come into the Court,</HI> &amp;c. with that the King an&s;wered and &s;aid, <HI>Here:</HI> Then called he the Queen, by the Name of, Kathrine <HI>Queen of</HI> England, <HI>come into the Court,</HI> &amp;c. who made no An&s;wer, but ro&s;e out of her Chair.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="182">And becau&s;e &s;he could not come directly to the King for the Di&s;tance &s;evered between them, &s;he went about by the Court, and came to the King, kneeling down at his Feet; to whom &s;he &s;aid in effect as followeth: Sir, I de&s;ire you to do me Ju&s;tice and Right, and take &s;ome Pity on me, for I am a poor Wo|man, and Stranger born out of your Domi|nions, having here no indifferent Counccl, and le&s;s A&s;&s;urance of Friend&s;hip. Alas, Sir, what have I offended you, or what Occa&s;ion of Di&s;plea&s;ure have I &s;hewed you, intending thus to put me from you after this Sort. I take God to my Judge, I have been to you a true and humble Wife, ever conformable to your Will, and Plea&s;ure, that never contraried or gain&s;aid any thing thereof; and being al|ways contented with all things wherein you had any Delight, whether little or much, without Grudge or Di&s;plea&s;ure; I loved, for your &s;ake, all them whom you loved, whe|ther they were my Friends or Enemies. I have been your Wife the&s;e twenty Years and more, and you have had by me diver&s;e Chil|dren; if there be any ju&s;t Cau&s;e that you can allege again&s;t me, either of Di&s;hone&s;ty, or Matter lawful to put me from you, I am con|tent to depart, to my Shame and Rebuke; and if there be none, then I pray you to let me have Ju&s;tice at your Hand. The King your Father was, in his time, of excellent Wit; and the King of <HI>Spain, Ferdinand</HI> my Father, was reckoned one of the wi&s;e&s;t Princes that raigned in <HI>Spain</HI> many Years before; it is not
<PB N="186" REF="183">
to be doubted, but that they had gathered as wi&s;e Councellors unto them of every Realme, as to their Wi&s;dom they thought meet, who deemed the Marriage between you and me good and lawful: Wherefore, I humbly de|&s;ire you to &s;pare me, untill I may know what Councell my Friends in <HI>Spain</HI> will adverti&s;e me to take; and if you will not, then your Plea&s;ure be fulfilled. With that &s;he ro&s;e up, making a low Curte&s;ie to the King, and de|parted from thence.</P>
<P>The King being adverti&s;ed that &s;he was ready to go out of the Hou&s;e, commanded the Crier to call her again, who called her by the&s;e Words: Cathrine <HI>Queen of England come into the Court</HI>; with that (quoth Mr. <HI>Griffith)</HI> Madam you be called again. On on, quoth &s;he, it maketh no Matter I will not tarry, go on your wayes, and thus &s;he departed without any farther An&s;wer at that Time, or any other, and never would appear after in any Court. The King, perceiving &s;he was departed, &s;aid the&s;e Words in Effect: For as much, quoth he, as the Queen is gone, I will, in her Ab|&s;ence declare to you all, that &s;he hath been to me as true, as obedient, and as conformable a Wife, as I could Wi&s;h or De&s;ire. She hath all the virtuous Qualities that ought to be in a Woman of her Dignity, or in any other of a ba&s;er E&s;tate; &s;he is al&s;o &s;urely a noble Woman born, her Conditions will well declare the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="184">With that, quoth <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> the Cardinal, Sir I mo&s;t humbly require your Highne&s;s, to de|clare, before all this Audience whether I have been the chief and fir&s;t Mover of this Matter unto your Maje&s;ty or no, for I am greatly &s;u&s;pected herein. My Lord Cardinal, quoth the King, I can well excu&s;e you in this Matter; Marrie, quoth he, you have rather been again&s;t me, in the tempting hereof than a Setter for|ward or Mover of the &s;ame. The &s;pecial Cau&s;e that moved me unto this Matter, was a certain Scrupulo&s;ity that pricked my Con|&s;cience, upon ceriain Words &s;poken at a Time, when it was by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Baion</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who had been hither &s;ent upon the debating of a Marriage between our Daugh|ter the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> &s;econd Son to the King of <HI>France.</HI> Upon the Re&s;olution and Determination whereof, he de&s;ired Re&s;pite to adverti&s;e the King his Ma&s;ter thereof, whether our Daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;hould legitimate in Re&s;pect of this my Marriage with this Woman, being &s;ometime my Brother's Wife; which Words, once conceived within the &s;ecret Bottom of my Con&s;cience, ingen|dered &s;uch a &s;crupulous Doubt, that my Con|&s;cience was incontinently accombred, vex|ed, di&s;quieted; whereby I thought my&s;elf to be greatly in Danger of God's Indignation, which appeared to be (as to me &s;eemed) the rather for that he fent us no i&s;&s;ue Male, and all &s;uch I&s;&s;ues Male as my &s;aid Wife had by me, died incontinent after they came into the World, &s;o I doubted the great Di&s;plea&s;ure of God in
<PB N="188" REF="185">
that behalf. Thus my Con&s;cience being to&s;&s;ed in the Waves of a &s;crupulous Mind, and partly De&s;pair to have any other I&s;&s;ue than I had al|ready by this Lady now my Wife, it behoved me further to con&s;ider the State of this Realm, and the Danger it &s;tood in for lack of a Prince to &s;ucceed me: I thought it good, in Relea&s;e of the weighty Burthen of my weak Con&s;cience, and al&s;o the quiet E&s;tate of this worthy Realm, to attempt the Law therein, whether I may lawfully take another Wife, by whom God may &s;end me more I&s;&s;ue, in ca&s;e this my fir&s;t Copulation was not good, without any carnal Concupi&s;cence, and not for any Di&s;plea&s;ure or mi&s;liking of the Queen's Per&s;on and Age, with whom I would be as well contented to continue, if our Marriage may &s;tand with the Laws of God, as with any alive. In this Point con|fi&s;teth all this Doubt, that we go about now to trie, by the Learning, Wi&s;dom and Judg|ment of you our Prelates and Pa&s;tors of all this our Realm and Dominions, now here a&s;&s;em|bled for that Purpo&s;e, to who&s;e Con&s;cience and Learning I have committed the Charge and Judgment, according to the which I will (God willing) be right well content to &s;ub|mit my&s;elf, and, for my Part obey the &s;ame. Wherein after that I perceived my Con&s;cience &s;o doubtfull, I moved it in Confe&s;&s;ion to you my Lord of <HI>Lincoln</HI> then Gho&s;tly Father, and for &s;o much as then you your&s;elf were in &s;ome Doubt, you moved me to a&s;k the Councel of all the&s;e my Lords; whereupon I moved you my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> fir&s;t, to have your Li|cence, in as much as you were Metropolitan,
<PB N="189" REF="186">
to put this Matter in Que&s;tion, and &s;o I did of all you my Lords, to which you granted under your Seals, here to be &s;hewed. That is truth quoth the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> After that the King ro&s;e up; and the Court was adjourned untill another Day.</P>
<P>Here is to be noted, that the Queen in Pre|&s;ence of the whole Court, mo&s;t greveou&s;ly ac|cu&s;ed the Cardinal of Untruth, Deceit, Wic|kedne&s;s and Malice, which had &s;owne Di&s;cen|tion betwixt her and the King her Hu&s;band; and therefore openly prote&s;ted, that &s;he did utterly abhore, refu&s;e and for&s;ake &s;uch a Judge, as was not only a mo&s;t malicious Enemy to her, but al&s;o a manife&s;t Adver&s;arie to all Right and Ju&s;tice, and therewith did &s;he appeal unto the <HI>Pope,</HI> committing her whole Cau&s;e to be judg|ed by him. But notwith&s;tanding this Appeal, the Legates &s;at weekly, and every Day were Argument on both Parts, and Proofes alleged for the under&s;tanding of the Ca&s;e, and &s;till they &s;tayed if they could by any Means to pro|cure the Queen to call back her Appeal; which &s;he utterly refu&s;ed to do. The King would gladly have had an end in this Matter; but when the Legates drave Time, and determined upon no certain Point, he conceived a &s;u&s;pi|cion, that this was done of Purpo&s;e, that their doings might draw to none Effect or Conclu|&s;ion."</P>

The King's Councel alledged the Matrimony not to be lawful at the Beginning, becau&s;e of the carnal Copulation had between Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> and the Queen. This Matter was very vehe|mently touched on that Side; and, to prove it, they alledged many Rea&s;ons and Similitudes of Truth; and being an&s;wered negatively again on the other Side, it &s;eemed that all their former Allegations were doubtful to be tried, and that no Man knew the Truth, and thus this Court pa&s;&s;ed from Se&s;&s;ions to Se&s;&s;ions, and Day to Day, till at certain of their Se&s;&s;ions the King &s;ent the two Cardinals to the Queen (who was then in <HI>Bridwell</HI>) to per&s;uade with her by their Wi&s;doms, and to advi&s;e her to &s;urrender the whole Matter into the King's Hands, by her own Con&s;ent and Will, which &s;hould be much better to her Honour, than to &s;tand to the Tryal of Law, and thereby to be con|demned, which &s;hould &s;eem much to her Di&s;honour.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="199">The Cardinal being in the Queen's Chamber of Pre&s;ence, the Gentleman U&s;her adverti&s;ed the Queen that the Cardinals were come to &s;peak with her, with that &s;he ro&s;e up, and with a Skeine of white Thread about her Neck, came into her Chamber of Pre&s;ence, where the Cardinals were attending. At who&s;e coming, quoth &s;he, what is your Plea&s;ure with me? If it plea&s;e your Grace, quoth Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> to go into your Privy Chamber we will &s;hew the Cau&s;e of our coming. My Lord, quoth &s;he, if ye have any Thing to &s;ay, &s;peak it openly before all the&s;e Folk, for I fear nothing you can &s;ay again&s;t me, but that I would have all the World &s;hould hear and &s;ee it, and therefore &s;peak your Mind. Then began the Cardinal to &s;peak to her in <HI>Latine.</HI> Nay, good my Lord, quoth &s;he, &s;peak to me in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>For&s;ooth (quoth the Cardinal) good Ma|dam, if it plea&s;e you, we come both to know your Mind, how you are di&s;po&s;ed to do in this Matter between the King and you, and al&s;o to declare &s;ecretely our Opinions and Councels unto you, which we do only for very Zeal and Obedience we bear unto your Grace. My Lord, quoth &s;he, I thank you for your good Will, but to make you An&s;wer in your Reque&s;t I cannot &s;o &s;uddenly; for I was &s;et among my Maids at Work, thinking full little of any &s;uch Matter, wherein there needeth a longer Deliberation, and a better Head than mine to make An&s;wer, for I need Councell in this Call which touches me &s;o near, and for any Coun|cell

or Friend&s;hip that I can find in <HI>England,</HI> they are not for my Profit, what think you my Lords, will any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> Councell me, or be Friend to me again&s;t the King's Plea&s;ure, that is his Subject? Nay for&s;ooth, and as for Councell, in whom I will put my tru&s;t, they be not here, they be in <HI>Spain,</HI> in my own Country.

And therewith &s;he took the Cardinal by the Hand, and led him into her privy Chamber with the other Cardinal, where they tarried a Sea&s;on talking with the Queen, which Communication ended, they departed to the King, making to him Rela|tion of her Talk. Thus this Ca&s;e went for|ward from Court to Court, till it came to Judgment, &s;o that every one expected that Judgment would be given the next Day.

<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes the King fir&s;t &s;ee <HI>Anna Bullen</HI> at a Banquet given by Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey.</HI> There &s;eems to be &s;ome little Ab&s;urdity in this Incident; for <HI>Anna Bullen</HI> being, as the Lord Chamberlain afterwards tells the King, one of the Queen's Attendants, it can hardly be &s;up|po&s;ed that he never &s;aw her before. This Ban|quet is at large de&s;cribed by <HI>Holing&s;hed. Shake|&s;pear</HI> follows him clo&s;ely in &s;everal of the Cir|cum&s;tances, as well as the Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between the King and &s;ome of the Per&s;ons pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>"On a time, &s;ays <HI>Holing&s;hed,</HI> Page 921, the King came &s;uddenly thither in a Ma&s;k, with a Dozen Ma&s;kers, all in Garments like Shepherds, made of fine Cloth of Gold, and Crim&s;on Sattin paned, and Caps of the &s;ame, with Vizards of good Phy&s;nomie, their Hair and Beards either of fine Gold-wire, Silk, or Black Silk, having &s;ixteen Torch-bearers, be|&s;ides their Drums, and other Per&s;ons with their Vizards, all cloathed in Sattin of the &s;ame Co|lour, and before his entering into the Hall, he came by Water to the Water-gate without Noi&s;e, where were laid diver&s;e Chambers and Guns charged with Shot, and at his Landing they were &s;hot off, which made &s;uch a Rumble in the Air that it was like Thunder, it made all the Noblemen, Ladies, and Gentlemen to mu&s;e what it &s;hould mean, coming &s;o &s;udden|ly, they &s;itting quiet at a &s;olemn Banquet after
<PB N="214" REF="211">
this Sort. Fir&s;t, you &s;hall under&s;tand that the Tables were &s;et in the Chamber of Pre&s;ence, ju&s;t covered, and the Lord Cardinal &s;itting un|der a Cloth of State, there having all his Ser|vice alone, and was there &s;et a Lady with a Nobleman, or a Gentleman and a Gentlewo|man throughout all the Tables in the Chamber on the one Side, which were made and joined as it were but one Table, all which order and devi&s;e was done by the Lord <HI>Sanders,</HI> then Lord Chamberlain to the King, and by Sir <HI>Henry Guildford,</HI> Comptroller of the King's Hou&s;e. Then immediately after the Great Chamberlain, and the &s;aid Comptroller, &s;ent to look what it &s;hould mean (as though they knew nothing of the Matter) who looking out of the Windows into the <HI>Thames,</HI> returned again and &s;hewed him, that it &s;eemed they were Noblemen and Strangers that arrived at his Bridge, coming as Amba&s;&s;adors from &s;ome fo|reign Prince, With that, quoth the Cardinal, I de&s;ire you becau&s;e you can &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> to take the Pains to go into the Hall, there to receive them according to their E&s;tates, and to conduct them into this Chamber, where they &s;hall &s;ee us, and all the&s;e noble Per&s;onages, being merry at our Banquet de&s;iring them to &s;it down with us, and to take part of our Fare. Then went down incontinently into the Hall, where they were received with twenty new Torches, and conveyed them up into the Chamber with &s;uch a noi&s;e of Drums and Flutes, as &s;eldom had been heard the like. At their entring into the Chamber two and two together, they went directly towards the Car|dinal,
<PB N="215" REF="212">
where he &s;at, and &s;aluted him reve|rently. To whom the Lord Chamberlain for them &s;aid; Sir, for as much as they be Stran|gers, and can not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they have de|&s;ired me to declare unto you, that having un|der&s;tanding of this triumphant Banquet, where was a&s;&s;embled &s;uch a Number of excellent Dames, they could do no le&s;s under &s;upport of your Grace, but to repair hither, to view as well their incomparable Beauty, as for to ac|company them at Mum-chance, and then to Dance with them; and, Sir, they require of your Grace, Licence to accompli&s;h the &s;aid Cau&s;e of their coming. To whom the Car|dinal &s;aid, he was very well content they &s;hould do &s;o. Then went the Ma&s;kers, and fir&s;t &s;aluted all the Dames, and returned to the mo&s;t worthy, and there opened their great Cup of Gold filled with Crowns and other Pieces of Gold, to whom they &s;et certain Pieces of Gold to ca&s;t at. Thus peru&s;ing all the Ladies and Gentlewomen, to &s;ome they lo&s;t, and of &s;ome they won; and marking after this Man|ner all the Ladies, they returned to the Cardi|nal with great Reverence, powring down all the Gold &s;o left in their Cup, which was a|bout two Hundred Crowns. At all quoth the Cardinal, and &s;o ca&s;t the Dice and wone them, whereat was made a great Noi&s;e and Joy. Then, quoth the Cardinal to the Lord Chamberlain. I pray you, that you would &s;hew them, that me &s;eemeth there &s;hould be a Nobleman among&s;t them, who is more meet to occupy this Seat and Place than I am, to
<PB N="216" REF="213">
whom I would mo&s;t gladly &s;urrender the &s;ame according to my Duty, if I knew him.</P>
<P>Then &s;pake the Lord Chamberlain to them in <HI>French,</HI> and they rounding him in the Ear, the Chamberlain &s;aid unto my Lord Cardinal, Sir quoth he, they confe&s;s, that among them there is &s;uch a noble Per&s;onage, whom if your Grace can point him out from the re&s;t, he is content to di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elf, and accept your Place. With that the Cardinal taking good Advi&s;ement among them, at the la&s;t quoth he, me &s;eemeth the Gentleman with the black Beard, &s;hould be he, and with that ro&s;e out of his Chair, and offered the &s;ame to the Gentle|man in the black Beard with his Cap in his Hand. The Per&s;on to whom he offered the Chair was Sir <HI>Edward Nevill,</HI> a comely Knight, that much more re&s;embled the King's Per&s;on in that Ma&s;k than any other. The King per|ceiving the Cardinal &s;o deceived, could not forbear laughing, but pulling down his Vi&s;ar and Mr. <HI>Nevill</HI>'s al&s;o, and da&s;hed out &s;uch a plea&s;ant Countenance and Cheere, that all the noble E&s;tates there a&s;&s;embled perceiving the King to be there among them, rejoiced very much."</P>

<P>This Play, as the learned Mr. <HI>Upton</HI> ob|&s;erves in his critical Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> might be properly called the Fall of Car|dinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> if the Action had clo&s;ed with the Marriage of the King to <HI>Anna Bullen.</HI></P>
<P>This haughty Churchman is indeed &s;hewn in the Heighth of his Power and Favour with the King, from whence he falls by a Concur|rence of unhappy Circum&s;tances, which bring on his total Di&s;grace, and at la&s;t his Death: But even in this Ca&s;e, the Action could not be con&s;idered as one and entire, while Queen <HI>Ca|tharine</HI>'s Sufferings make &s;o large a Part of it, and which, from the Dignity of her Character, and the great and &s;udden Rever&s;e of her For|tune, cannot, with any Propriety, form only a &s;ubordinate Incident in a Play, who&s;e Sub|ject is the Fall of a much le&s;s con&s;iderable Per|&s;on than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Catharine</HI> has a higher Claim to give a Title to the Tragedy than <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> &s;ince her Quality and Misfortunes are both &s;uperior to his. She, like him, is &s;hewn in the Sun&s;hine
<PB N="226" REF="223">
of her Fortune, a Queen, and happy in the Affections of her Sovereign and Hu&s;bund, as may be concluded from King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Speech to her at her Entrance into the Council-Cham|ber.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ari&s;e and take your Place by us, half your Suit</L>
<L>Never name to us; you have half our Power;</L>
<L>The other Moity, ere you a&s;k is given;</L>
<L>Repeat your Will, and take it.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>After this, we &s;ee her de&s;pi&s;ed, neglected, bani&s;hed from his Bed, the Name and Cha|racter of Wife taken from her, divorced, un|queen'd, and &s;hutting up all her Sorrows in Death. The Fate of this Queen, or that of Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> each &s;ingly afforded a Subject for Tragedy. <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> by blending them in the &s;ame Piece, has de&s;troyed the Unity of his Fable, divided our Attention between them; and, by adding many other inconnected Incidents, all foreign to his De&s;ign, has given us an irregular hi&s;torical Drama, in&s;tead of a fini&s;hed Tragedy.</P>
<P>In all that related to Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> he has exactly followed hi&s;torical Truth; and his Character, as drawn by the Queen and <HI>Grif|fith,</HI> with all its Lights and Shades, is, as the Reader may perceive, clo&s;ely copied from that Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> in the Play, being told by <HI>Griffith,</HI> her Gentleman U&s;her, that the Cardinal is dead, replies,
<Q><PB N="227" REF="224">
<L>So may he re&s;t, his Faults lie gently on him!</L>
<L>Yet thus far, <HI>Griffith,</HI> give me leave to &s;peak him,</L>
<L>And yet with Charity; he was a Man</L>
<L>Of an unbounded Stomach, ever ranking</L>
<L>Him&s;elf with Princes: One that by Sugge&s;tion</L>
<L>Ty'd all the Kingdom; Simony was fair Play:</L>
<L>His own Opinion was his Law. I'th'Pre&s;ence</L>
<L>He would &s;ay Untruths, and be ever double</L>
<L>Both in his Words and Meaning. He was never,</L>
<L>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</L>
<L>His Promi&s;es were, as he then was, mighty;</L>
<L>But his Performance, as he now is, nothing.</L>
<L>Of his own Body he was ill, and gave</L>
<L>The Clergy ill Example</L></Q></P>
<P>"This Cardinal was of a great Stomach, for he counted him&s;elf equal with Princes; and by crafty Sugge&s;tion got into his Hands innu|merable Trea&s;ure; he forced little on Simony, and was not pitiful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and &s;tood affectionate in his own Opinion. In open Pre&s;ence he would lie and &s;ay Untruths, and was double both in Speech and Meaning; he would promi&s;e much and perform little; he was vicious of his Body, and gave the Clergy evil Example."</P>

<SPEAKER>GRIFFITH.</SPEAKER>
<L>This Cardinal,</L>
<L>Though from an humble Stock, undoubtedly</L>
<L>Was fa&s;hion'd to much Honour, from his Cradle;</L>
<L>He was a Scholar, and a ripe and good One;</L>
<L>Exceeding wife, fair &s;poken, and per&s;uading;</L>
<L>Lofty and &s;our to them that lov'd him not;</L>
<L>But to tho&s;e Men, that &s;ought him, &s;weet as Summer.</L>
<L>And though he were un&s;atisfy'd in getting,</L>
<L>(Which was a &s;in) yet in be&s;towing, Madam,</L>
<L>He was mo&s;t princely: Ever witne&s;s for him</L>
<L>Tho&s;e Twins of Learning that he rais'd in you,</L>
<L><HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> one of which fell with him,</L>
<L>Unwilling to out-live the Good he did it;</L>
<L>The other, though unfini&s;h'd, yet &s;o famous,</L>
<L>So excellent in Art, and &s;till &s;o ri&s;ing,</L>
<L>That Chri&s;tendom &s;hall ever &s;peak his Virtue,</L>
<L>His Overthrow heap'd Happine&s;s upon him;</L>
<L>For then, and not till then, he felt him&s;elf,</L>
<L>And found the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of being little:</L>
<L>And to add greater Honours to his Age,</L>
<L>Than Man could give him, he dy'd, fearing God.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>"This Cardinal, was a Man undoubtedly born to honour; I think &s;ome Princes Ba&s;tard, no Butcher's Son; exceeding wi&s;e, fair &s;poken, high minded, full of Revenge, vitious of his Body, lofty to his Enemies, were they never &s;o
<PB N="229" REF="226">
big; to tho&s;e that accepted and &s;ought his Friend&s;hip, wonderful courteous; a ripe School|man, thrall to affections, brought to Bed with flattery, in&s;atiable to get, and more princely in be&s;towing; as appeareth by his two Colleges of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> the one overthrown with his Fall; the other unfini&s;hed; and, yet, as it lieth, for a Hou&s;e of Students, con|&s;idering all the Appurtances, incomparable through Chri&s;tendome, whereof <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth is now called Founder, becau&s;e he let it &s;tand. He held and enjoyed at once the Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>York, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> the Dignity of Lord Cardinal, Legate and Chancelor, the Abbey of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> divers Pri|ories, &s;undry fat Benifices <HI>in commendam</HI>; a great Preferrer of his Servants, an Advancer of Learning, &s;tout in every Quarrel, never hap|py till this his Overthrow, wherein he &s;hewed &s;uch Moderation and ended &s;o perfectly, that the Hour of his Death did him more Honour than all the Pomp of his Life."</P>
<P>Tho' the Character of King <HI>Henry</HI> is drawn after this Hi&s;torian, yet <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has placed it in the mo&s;t advantagious Light; In this Play he repre&s;ents him as greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the Grievances of his Subjects and ordering them to be relieved, tender and obliging to his Queen, grateful to the Cardinal, and in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing and rewarding true Merit. If, in the latter Part of the Play, he endeavours to ca&s;t the dis|agreeable Parts of this Prince's Character as much into Shade as po&s;&s;ible, it is not to be
<PB N="230" REF="227">
wondered at. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> wrote in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a Prince&s;s who inherited more of the Ambition of her Father <HI>Henry,</HI> than of the Tenderne&s;s and Delicacy of her Mother <HI>Anne Bullen</HI>: And however &s;en&s;ible &s;he might be of the Injuries her Mother endur'd, would not have &s;uffered her Father's Character to have been drawn in the wor&s;t Colours, either by an Hi&s;torian or a Poet. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has exerted an equal degree of Complai&s;ance to|wards Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by the amiable Lights he &s;hews her Mother in, in this Play,</P>
<P><HI>Anne Bullen</HI> is repre&s;ented as affected with the mo&s;t tender Concern for the Sufferings of her Mi&s;tre&s;s, Queen <HI>Catharine</HI>; receiving the Honour the King confers on her, by making her Marchione&s;s of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> with a graceful Humility; and more anxious to conceal her Advancement from the Queen, le&s;t it &s;hould aggravate her Sorrows, than &s;olicitous to penetrate into the Meaning of &s;o extraordinary a Favour, or of indulging her&s;elf in the flatter|ing Pro&s;pect of future Royalty.</P>

<HEAD><HI>THE TALE of</HI> Geneura: From the <HI>Italian</HI> of <HI>Lodovico Ario&s;to,</HI> in the Fifth Book of his <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE noble <HI>Rilando</HI> &s;ailing to <HI>England,</HI> whither he was &s;ent on an Emba&s;&s;y by the Emperor <HI>Charlemaine,</HI> a violent Storm aro&s;e, which continuing two Days and Nights, drove him, at la&s;t, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland:</HI> His Fleet arriving &s;afe, he ordered his Retinue to meet him at <HI>Berwick,</HI> him&s;elf, without any Attendants, &s;truck into the fa|mous Fore&s;t of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> not without a Hope of meeting with &s;ome Adventure worthy his Courage and Virtue.</P>
<P>While he was plea&s;ing him&s;elf with this Ex|pectation, &s;ometimes riding, and &s;ometimes walking a &s;low Pace leading his Hor&s;e, Night drew on, and he now began to think it nece&s;|&s;ary to go in que&s;t of a Lodging. Perceiving an Abbey at &s;ome Di&s;tance, he remounted his
<PB N="232" REF="229">
Hor&s;e and rode up to it. The Abbot and his Monks, &s;eeing a Stranger of a noble Appear|ance at their Gate, came out, and with great Civility invited him to pa&s;s the Night there.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo</HI> gratefully accepted their Offer; and being conducted to a Chamber, and an elegant Repa&s;t &s;erved to the Table, as &s;oon as he had &s;atisfied the Cravings of an Ap|petite made eager by Travel and long Fa&s;ting, he enquired of the good Fathers what noble Exploits in Arms had been lately performed in their Neighbourhood, and whether a Warrior might hope to find any Occa&s;ions there of &s;ig|nalizing his Valour?</P>
<P>'Tis certain, replied the Abbot, that many great and wonderful Adventures have been at|chieved in this Fore&s;t, but as the Place, &s;o are the Actions, ob&s;cure, and buried in Oblivion: Hovever, if Honour be your Pur&s;uit, the pre|&s;ent time affords you a fit Opportunity to ac|quire it; the Danger, indeed, is great, but if you &s;ucceed eternal Fame will be your Re|ward. The young and beautiful <HI>Geneura,</HI> the Daughter of our King, is accu&s;ed by a Knight named <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> of having violated her Cha&s;tity; and it being provided by our <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Laws, that all Dam&s;els, of what Rank &s;oever, who are publickly charged with In|continence, &s;hall &s;uffer the Puni&s;hment of Fire, unle&s;s a Champion be found who will under|take their Defence, and fight with the Ac|cu&s;er.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="230"><HI>Geneura,</HI> in Con&s;equence of this Law, has been adjudged to die, and only a Month's Space allowed her to procure a Defender of her Life and Honour. The King, anxious for his Daughter's Safety, but more for her Reputation, has cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions, that by whatever Per&s;on (provided his Birth he not ab&s;olutely ba&s;e) his Daughter &s;hall be delivered from the Danger that threatens her, to him &s;hall the Prince&s;s be given in Marriage, with a Portion &s;uitable to her high Rank and Quality.</P>
<P>This Enterprize, noble Stranger, is worthy your Youth, your Courage, and Genero&s;ity: The Law of Arms requires all true Knights to undertake the Defence of injured and oppre&s;&s;ed Ladies; and, &s;urely, a fairer than <HI>Geneura</HI> is not to be found from one Extremity of the Globe to the other; nor, if common Opinion may be relied on, a cha&s;ter.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid <HI>Rinaldo</HI> after a little Pau&s;e, that this fair Prince&s;s is condemned to die for having generou&s;ly rewarded the Pa&s;&s;ion of a faithful Lover? Cur&s;ed be the Makers of &s;o hard a Law; more cur&s;ed they that are in|fluenced by it. For me it matters not whether <HI>Geneura</HI> be ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly accu&s;ed; what has been imputed to her as a Crime, were I her Judge, &s;he &s;hould be applauded for, had &s;he taken care to have avoided Di&s;covery; and, as it is, I am re&s;olved to defy her Accu&s;er to Combat, and, I tru&s;t, &s;hall be able to deliver
<PB N="234" REF="231">
her from the unju&s;t and cruel Puni&s;hment &s;he has been doomed to.</P>
<P>The Abbot and Monks, overjoyed that they had procured a Champion for their Prince&s;s, lavi&s;hed a thou&s;and Prai&s;es on <HI>Rinaldo</HI> for his generous De&s;ign; and he, full of Impatience to begin the glorious Enterprize, being furni&s;h|ed by his Ho&s;ts with a Guide, &s;et out early the next Morning for the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Court, leaving the good Fathers charmed with his Courage and Gallantry, and offering up repeated Pray|ers to Heaven for his Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>As they were pur&s;uing their Journey through Bye-roads, for the greater Expedition, a Cry, as of &s;ome Per&s;on in Di&s;tre&s;s, rouzed all their Attention. In&s;tantly <HI>Rinaldo</HI> clapped Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and bending his Cour&s;e towards the Place from whence the Noi&s;e proceeded, he came to a deep Valley, &s;urrounded with Trees, through the Branches of which he perceived a young Maid &s;truggling to free her&s;elf from the Hands of two Ruffians, who were attempting to murder her. Tran&s;ported with Rage at this Sight, the generous <HI>Rinaldo</HI> flew to the Relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Dam&s;el; his Appearance &s;o terrified the intended Murderers, that they left their Prey, and fled with the utmo&s;t Precipita|tion.</P>
<P>Mean time the Maid recovered from her Fright, thanked her Deliverer with a Tran&s;|port of Joy and Gratitude, and was beginning to acquaint him with the Story of her Misfor|tunes,
<PB N="235" REF="232">
when he, who had not alighted, being eager to pur&s;ue his Journey, commanded his Guide to take her up behind him; and as they travelled, having at lei&s;ure ob&s;erved her Coun|tenance and Behaviour, he was &s;o much &s;truck with the Beauty of the one, and the &s;oft and gentle Mode&s;ty of the other, that his Curio&s;ity was awakened, and he became &s;olicitous to know by what means &s;he had been brought in|to &s;o cruel a Situation.</P>
<P>His Reque&s;t being inforced with kind A&s;|&s;urances of future Protection, the Dam&s;el, with a low Voice, and Eyes ca&s;t down in a graceful Confu&s;ion, began in this manner:</P>
<P>Since you, my generous Deliverer, have commanded me to relate my Misfortunes, pre|pare to hear a Tale more full of Horror, an Act of greater Villainy and Ba&s;ene&s;s than <HI>A|thens, Thebes,</HI> or <HI>Argos</HI> ever knew. Ah! 'tis no Wonder that our barren Clime is cur&s;t with a long Winter's cea&s;ele&s;s Rage, <HI>Phoebus</HI> di&s;|dains to &s;hine upon a Land where &s;uch inhu|man Crimes are perpetrated; Deeds black as Darkne&s;s, and fit to be covered with everla&s;t|ing Night; unhappy as I am, I bore but too great a Share in tho&s;e I am going to relate.</P>
<P>From my earlie&s;t Youth I was brought up in the Palace with the Daughter of our King, honoured with a near Attendance on her Per|&s;on, and happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Af|fection and E&s;teem. Long might I have en|joyed this delightful Situation; but Love (ah!
<PB N="236" REF="233">
that ever &s;o &s;weet a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould prove the Source of &s;o much Mi&s;ery) Love interrupted my Tranquillity, &s;ubjected my whole Soul, and gave me up to Guilt, to Shame, and un|availing Penitence.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alban</HI> was the Subject of my Virgin Wi&s;hes, my Youth and Per&s;on plea&s;ed him; &s;killed as he was in every deluding Art by which the fal&s;e and the de&s;igning Part of his Sex betray the unexperienced of ours, is it any Wonder that I was deceived? Fond of believing what I wi&s;hed, and judging of his Pa&s;&s;ion by my own, I yielded to his De&s;ires, and vainly hoped this Sacrifice of my Honour would &s;ecure to me for ever, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Heart.</P>
<P>Our guilty Commerce la&s;ted &s;ome Months, during which time I always received his Vi&s;its in a Summer Apartment belonging to the Prin|ce&s;s my Mi&s;tre&s;s, into which, as it was now the mo&s;t rigid Sea&s;on of the Year, &s;he never entered; and being al&s;o in a Part of the Palace little frequented, and the Windows oppo&s;ite to &s;ome ruined Hou&s;es, my Lover could come thither unob&s;erved, and by the Help of a &s;ilken Cord which I let down to him, ea&s;ily a&s;cend the Chamber.</P>
<P>All Sen&s;e of Virtue being now &s;ubdued, and my whole Soul &s;unk in a dear lethargick Dream of Plea&s;ure, I never once &s;u&s;pected, that as my Pa&s;&s;ion increa&s;ed, that of my Lover was decrea&s;ing: Ah! my too violent Love favour|ed
<PB N="237" REF="234">
his Deceit, or &s;oon I might have perceived that he feigned much, and loved but little.</P>
<P>At length, notwith&s;tanding my Prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, his Coldne&s;s became vi&s;ible; I &s;igh'd, I wept, I reproach'd, alas! how unavailing are all Endeavours to revive a decaying Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;atiated by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and con&s;tant only to In|con&s;tancy.</P>
<P><HI>Polyne&s;&s;o,</HI> &s;o was my faithle&s;s Lover named, langui&s;hed in &s;ecret for the bright <HI>Geneura,</HI> my royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, I know not if this Pa&s;&s;ion com|menced before my Ruin was compleated, or whether her more powerful Charms was the Cau&s;e of his Infidelity; but certain it is, that relying on the fervent Love I bore him, he made no Scruple to confe&s;s his Flame, even to me, urging me by all the Arguments his wick|ed Mind could &s;ugge&s;t, to move the Heart of <HI>Geneura</HI> in his Favour.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord judge, if this cruel Man was dear to me, ever &s;olicitous to procure his Hap|pine&s;s, and &s;oothed by his A&s;&s;urances that Am|bition was the prevailing Motive of his Addre&s;s to the Prince&s;s, in which, if he &s;ucceeded, he vowed to keep me &s;till his, and that I &s;hould Share with her his Per&s;on and his Heart, I con&s;ented to all he propo&s;ed; and following his In&s;tructions, took all Opportunities of prai&s;ing him to my Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alban</HI> was the con&s;tant Subject of my Di&s;cour&s;e; I extolled his Valour his Genero&s;ity, his illu&s;trious Birth, the manly
<PB N="238" REF="235">
Graces of his Per&s;on, the mingled Sweetne&s;s and Dignity of his Manners; the charming Theme tran&s;ported me out of my&s;elf; with eager Plea&s;ure I ran over all his Virtues, dwelt with Delight on every imputed Charm; &s;carce could my Tongue keep Pace with the over|flowings of my love&s;ick Fancy, fond of the dear Indulgence of talking in a per&s;onated Character of him I loved.</P>
<P>But when, in Compliance with his Injunc|tions, I ventured to in&s;inuate his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, then only did I &s;peak with Coldne&s;s and Re&s;traint; &s;lowly the unwilling Words found way, checked by my ri&s;ing Sighs, and prefaced by my Blu&s;hes. My Emotions could not have been hid from an intere&s;ted Ob&s;erva|tion; but the Prince&s;s was not only wholly indifferent to <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o,</HI> but indulged a &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ion for the all-accompli&s;hed <HI>Ariodant.</HI></P>
<P>This young Knight, an <HI>Italian</HI> by Birth, came with his Brother to the Court of <HI>Scotland,</HI> either in pur&s;uit of Glory, or to tran&s;act &s;ome &s;e|cret Bu&s;ine&s;s with the King. To the Graces of his Form, than which Nature never made one more lovely, is added a Mind fraught with whatever is mo&s;t great and excellent in Man|kind; his Valour never yet found an equal in our Land; his is the Prize at every Tourne|ment, his the foremo&s;t Honours of the Field: in Peace the Ornament of our Court, in War the Defender of our Country.</P>
<P>The King, to whom he had indeared him|&s;elf by a thou&s;and Services, loaded him with
<PB N="239" REF="236">
Riches and Honours, and gave him the fir&s;t Employments in the Kingdom; the Hill of <HI>Sicily</HI> burns not with fiercer Fires, nor glows <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> with more ardent Flames, than tho&s;e which the bright Eyes of our Prince&s;s kindled in the Heart of <HI>Ariodant.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;oon di&s;covered that <HI>Geneura</HI> approved, encouraged and returned his Pa&s;&s;ion; and being, as you may ea&s;ily imagine, not greatly con|cerned at this Ob&s;tacle to the De&s;ires of my faithle&s;s Duke, I acquainted him with all I knew, and from the apparent Impo&s;&s;ibility of his ever &s;ucceeding in his Attempt, drew Arguments to induce him to give it over.</P>
<P><HI>Polyne&s;&s;o,</HI> naturally haughty and vindictive, could not bear with Patience, the Thoughts of being rejected for a Stranger. Every way, as he conceived, his Inferior; Di&s;dain, Shame, Rage, by turns, engro&s;&s;ed his Soul, and ba|ni&s;hed thence every &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ion; his Love for <HI>Geneura</HI> was now converted to the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Hatred, and he re&s;olved to accompli&s;h her ruin by the blacke&s;t Trea&s;on that ever was conceived in the Heart of Man.</P>
<P>His Scheme of Revenge concerted, in which I, alas! tho' ignorantly, was to act the chiefe&s;t Part, he one Day acco&s;ted me with an Air more tender and affectionate than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Dalinda,</HI> &s;aid he, generous and kind as you have been to me, well may you think your&s;elf injured by my Incon&s;tancy,
<PB N="240" REF="237">
but as Trees, you know, when cropt by the Pruner's Hand, &s;hoot out into fre&s;h luxuriant Branches, &s;o on the Root of my Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Geneura,</HI> young Buds of Fondne&s;s ri&s;e and all the ripening Fruit is yours.</P>
<P>Nor do I langui&s;h &s;o much for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Geneura</HI>'s Beauties, as I Di&s;dain to be thus rejected and contemned; and, le&s;t this Grief &s;hould prey too forcibly on my Heart, do thou, my Fair, indulge my &s;ick Fancy with a kind Deceit, and in the Dre&s;s of that too haughty Charmer, receive me to thy Arms.</P>
<P>When the Prince&s;s is retired to Bed, put on her Robes, adorn thee with her riche&s;t Jewels, with her Girdle bind thy &s;welling Bo&s;om, let her Coronet glitter on thy beauteous Brow, and beneath it let thy Hair de&s;cend in graceful Curls like hers; then, in her borrowed Form, attend my coming at the well-known Win|dow; thus &s;hall my Pride be gratified, and my capricious Fancy plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Without reflecting on the in&s;idious Purport of this Reque&s;t, I promi&s;ed to comply with it; and, for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nights, received him in the Habit he pre&s;cribed. Having thus wrought me to his Wi&s;h, his wicked Arts were next played off on <HI>Ariodant.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Duke had any Knowledge of his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Prince&s;s, he had lived in &s;trict Friend&s;hip with this young Knight, and thence
<PB N="241" REF="238">took Occa&s;ion to reproach him with the Breach of it, by pre&s;uming to addre&s;s the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>In you, &s;aid he, I little expected a Rival as well on Account of your Attachment to me, as the Improbability of your &s;ucceeding in your Attempt; for you are not now to be told of the mutual Pa&s;&s;ion that has long joined <HI>Geneura</HI>'s Heart and mine, nor that I intend &s;oon to a&s;k the King's Con&s;ent to e&s;pou&s;e her; why then do you fondly thru&s;t your&s;elf between me and my almo&s;t certain Happine&s;s? how dif|ferently &s;hould I act were I in your Place?</P>
<P>Why this to me, my Lord? replied <HI>Ariodant</HI> ha&s;tily, 'tis you who have betrayed our Friend&s;hip, you have commenced my Rival, not I yours; I claim a prior Right in fair <HI>Geneura,</HI> as have|ing loved her fir&s;t, and have been happy enough to in&s;pire her with an equal Flame; this you might have perceived, had you not been blind|ed by Ob&s;tinacy; &s;ince then the Laws of Friend&s;hip demand one of us to yield, be yours the Ta&s;k as having le&s;s Right to per&s;i&s;t, and le&s;s Hope of &s;ucceeding than my&s;elf. In Riches indeed you are my Superior; but the King's Favour is equally &s;hared betwixt us, and in the Heart of <HI>Geneura</HI> the Advantage is wholly mine.</P>
<P>What Errors does not Love Occa&s;ion? repli|ed the Duke; each thinks him&s;elf the happy Object of her Wi&s;hes, and yet 'tis certain that only one is loved: Thus then let us decide the Conte&s;t; he who can give the mo&s;t certain
<PB N="242" REF="239">
Proofs of her Affection &s;hall be left by the other in the free and undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but, fir&s;t, let us bind our&s;elves by the mo&s;t &s;olemn Oaths not to di&s;clo&s;e each others Secret.</P>
<P>To this <HI>Ariodant,</HI> with trembling Impatience agreed, and the artful Duke went on in this Manner:</P>
<P>'Tis now almo&s;t five Months &s;ince the beautious <HI>Geneura,</HI> rewarded my ardent Love with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on; oft has the con&s;cious Queen of Night lent me her &s;hades to guide me to my Charmer and &s;een me hap|py in her Arms.</P>
<P>'Tis fal&s;e, by Heaven, interrupted <HI>Ariodant,</HI> tran&s;ported with Rage; not that cold Queen, who&s;e Name thou ha&s;t profaned, is cha&s;ter than my <HI>Geneura:</HI> Traitor, with my good Sword I'll prove thou lye&s;t, take Notice I defy thee to mortal Combat, and will with thy deare&s;t Blood, wa&s;h away the Slanders thou ha&s;t thrown upon my Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Moderate your Rage, &s;aid the calm Villain, I mean to give you Proofs, convincing Proofs, of what I have &s;aid, your own Eyes &s;hall be Witne&s;&s;es of the Favours I enjoy.</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Ariodant,</HI> pale, trembling, and lo&s;t in &s;peechle&s;s Grief and Horror at tho&s;e fatal Words, &s;tood for &s;ome Moments fixed in racking Thought, like the &s;ad Statue of De&s;pair; then rai&s;ing his Eyes, overflowing
<PB N="243" REF="240">
with Tears, to Heaven, and pa&s;&s;ionately &s;trik|ing his groaning Brea&s;t, and can it be, he cried, that my <HI>Geneura,</HI> that Prince&s;s whom I loved, whom I adored, with &s;uch pure Re|verence as mortals pay to Deities, &s;hould be|come the Prey of loo&s;e De&s;ires, and give her faithful <HI>Ariodant</HI> to Death? Oh! 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible, though a God &s;poke it, I &s;hould &s;ay t'were fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Incredulous Man, &s;aid <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o,</HI> have I not offered to give thee Proofs that cannot be de|nied? thy Eyes &s;hall &s;ee the Favours &s;he be&s;tows on me.</P>
<P>I take you at your Word, re&s;umed <HI>Ariodant</HI> impatiently, give me to behold her Guilt and I am &s;atisfyed.</P>
<P>To morrow Night, &s;aid the Duke, I have an Appointment with her; I will conduct you to a Place from whence, unperceived, you your&s;elf &s;hall behold me a&s;cend her Chamber Window, and judge by the Reception &s;he gives me, if I am happy in her Favour.</P>
<P>To this the almo&s;t di&s;tracted <HI>Ariodant</HI> con|&s;ented; and, at the appointed Time, followed the Duke to tho&s;e ruined Hou&s;es I mentioned before, and there &s;tood concealed from View: Being doubtful of <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI>'s Intentions he had ordered his Brother <HI>Lurcanio</HI> to arm and go with him, directing him to &s;tay at a convenient Di&s;tance &s;o as to be within call if any Treach|ery was offered him, but not in Sight of <HI>Gene|ura</HI>'s
<PB N="244" REF="241">
Window: for he would have no Witne&s;s of her Guilt but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Duke, having placed <HI>Ariodant</HI> mo&s;t conveniently for his Purpo&s;e, advanced and gave the u&s;ual Sign; unhappy as I am I heard, and eagerly obeyed the welcome Summons, adorned in <HI>Geneura</HI>'s riche&s;t Robes, and cover|ed with the Veil that Prince&s;&s;es only wear, I appeared at the Window and threw the Silken Ladder over to my Lover.</P>
<P><HI>Lurcanio</HI> either fearing for his Brother's Safety, or de&s;irous of prying into his Secrets, quitted his appointed Station and unperceived by him, walked &s;oftly forward till he came within ten Paces of <HI>Ariodant,</HI> and now my faithle&s;s Duke was &s;een by both the Brothers (though known only to <HI>Ariodant)</HI> to a&s;cend the Ladder and gain the Chamber Window, at which I met him with a tender Embrace, wandering over his Lips and Eyes with eager Ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This Sight &s;o enflamed the Soul of <HI>Ari|odant</HI> with Rage and Grief, that draw|ing out his Sword, and fixing the Pummel of it in the Ground, he was going to ru&s;h with all his Force upon the Point, had he not been prevented by <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> who perceiving his ra&s;h De&s;ign &s;prang to him in an In&s;tant, and having thrown a&s;ide the fatal In&s;trument of Death, received his &s;inking Brother in his Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="242">Ah mi&s;erable Brother! &s;aid <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> by what wild Fury art thou po&s;&s;e&s;t to fall thus meanly for a Woman? Now cur&s;ed, forever cur&s;ed be all the Kind, may they all peri&s;h, in one wide Ruin, blown as they are, like Clouds, with every bla&s;t of Wind; and this fair Mi&s;chief that has betrayed thee, let us devi&s;e &s;ome glo|rious Vengeance for her: Let not thy noble Life be &s;acrificed to her Fal&s;hood; her's is the Crime, be her's the Puni&s;hment; proclaim her Guilt aloud, accu&s;e her to the King, my Eyes as well as thine have &s;een her Infamy, and, with my Sword I'll make good thy A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><HI>Ariodant,</HI> who&s;e Soul was torn with various and conflicting Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;miled gloomily at the Mention of Revenge; a while he &s;eemed to bury every Thought of Grief and of De&s;pair in that one Hope of &s;acrificing the guilty Lover to his Wrongs: But alas! the curele&s;s Wound remained behind; <HI>Geneura,</HI> ba&s;e as &s;he appear|ed, he loved with &s;uch uncea&s;ing Fondne&s;s, that wholly unable to endure her Lo&s;s, and dreading no Hell like that within his Bo&s;om, once more he re&s;olved to die.</P>
<P>To <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> however he di&s;&s;embled his De|&s;ign, and went Home with him at his Reque&s;t; but early the next Morning he departed, leav|ing no Traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what Place he was gone.</P>
<P><HI>Lurcanio,</HI> dreading the fatal Effects of his De&s;pair, was pierced to his inmo&s;t Soul at the
<PB N="246" REF="243">
News of his Flight; the King and the whole Court took Part in his Affliction; no Methods were left untried to di&s;cover where he was; Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent in &s;earch of him to the utmo&s;t Extremities of the Kingdom: But all returned without any Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>At length a Pea&s;ant came to Court, and at his Reque&s;t was introduced to the Prince&s;s, who informed her, that as he was travelling to the City he met <HI>Ariodant</HI>; that this unhappy Knight obliged him to follow him and be Wit|ne&s;s of an Act he was going to perform; that obeying his Orders they journeyed on together till they came to a &s;teep Rock, that hung pendant over the Sea, fronting the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>Ariodant,</HI> &s;aid the Pea&s;ant, a&s;cending this Rock commanded me to ob&s;erve well what he did, to give you an Account of it, and tell you his la&s;t Words; which were, that he had &s;een too much: Then &s;pringing furiou&s;ly from the top of the Rock, he precipitated him&s;elf into the Sea. Terrified at the dreadful Sight, I ha&s;tily turned back, and travelled hither to bring you the fatal News.</P>
<P><HI>Geneura,</HI> overwhelmed with Grief and Amazement for the Death of her Lover, and the &s;trange Me&s;&s;age he had &s;ent her, abandon|ed her&s;elf to the mo&s;t violent Exce&s;&s;es of De|&s;pair; &s;he beat her beautious Bo&s;om, tore her Hair, and in the wildne&s;s of her Woe, a thou|&s;and Times invoked the dear loved Name of
<PB N="247" REF="244">
<HI>Ariodant</HI>; repeated the my&s;terious Words he uttered, and as often called on Death to end her.</P>
<P>The News of his Death, with the &s;ad Manner of it, &s;pread Grief and Con&s;ternation through the whole City; even the remote&s;t Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> felt and lamented the lo&s;s of their valiant Defender; the King and the whole Court bewailed his lo&s;s with the &s;incere&s;t Sor|row: but <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> &s;uperior in Grief, as more nearly intere&s;ted in the dear decea&s;ed, mourn|ed his unhappy Brother with all the tenderne&s;s of fraternal Love, and all the warmth of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Revolving in his Mind the fatal Ad|venture of the Window, which had been the Cau&s;e of his Brother's Di&s;traction; the De&s;ire and Hope of Revenge afforded &s;ome Relief to the poignancy of his Woe, and ob|&s;tinately bent to &s;acrifice the Prince&s;s to the <HI>Manes</HI> of his <HI>Ariodant,</HI> he pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore the King and Council, and accu&s;ed her of Incontinence, relating all that <HI>Ariodant</HI> and he had &s;een, and the fatal Effects it had upon him; he then reminded the King of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Laws again&s;t uncha&s;tity, and loudly demanded Ju&s;tice on the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Horror and Amazement &s;eized the Soul of the unhappy Father; <HI>Geneura</HI> tho' dearer to him than Life, tho' innocent in his Opinion, he has not Power to &s;creen from the Danger that threatens her; the Laws indeed permit
<PB N="248" REF="245">
the accu&s;ed to have a Champion to fight in her Defence; by whom, if the Pro&s;ecuter (who is obliged to maintain by Force of Arms the Truth of his A&s;&s;ertion) is wor&s;ted, &s;he is declared guiltle&s;s of the Crimes laid to her Charge.</P>
<P>To this only Remedy the King has Recour&s;e, and cau&s;es it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions, that if any Knight of noble Birth will undertake the Defence of his Daughter, and by Force of Arms &s;hall vanqui&s;h her Ac|cu&s;er, on him he will be&s;tow the Prince&s;s, with a Dower &s;uitable to her Quality.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Proclamation no Knight has yet offered him&s;elf for the Enterprize, deterred therefrom by the known Valour of <HI>Lurcanio</HI>; the King, no le&s;s anxious for <HI>Gene|ura</HI>'s Reputation than her Life, cau&s;ed all her Maids to be brought to a Tryal, who with one Voice declared they never were privy to any Intrigue of their royal Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the&s;e Proceedings, and dreading the Con&s;equence of a further Scrutiny, I urged the Duke to take &s;ome Mea&s;ures for our com|mon Security, he, with di&s;&s;embled Kindne&s;s, prai&s;ed my Secrecy and Affection, and &s;ent two Men to conduct me to a Ca&s;tle of his at a great Di&s;tance from the Court.</P>
<P>Wholly relying on his Faith, I put my&s;elf un|der the Protection of tho&s;e two Villains, whom the Duke, de&s;irous of removing for ever the only Per&s;on who could di&s;cover his Guilt,
<PB N="249" REF="246">
ordered when they came to a convenient Place to murder me; happily for me Chance conduct|ed you that Way; you delivered me from my impending Fate, and while it &s;hall plea&s;e Heaven to pre&s;erve my unhappy Life, it &s;hall be &s;pent in grateful Acknowledgments to my Protector.</P>
<P>This Account of <HI>Geneura</HI>'s Innocence was extreamly welcome to <HI>Rinaldo</HI>; for tho' con|fiding in his own Courage he was not without Hopes of delivering her, guilty as &s;he appeared; yet the certainty that he was going to fight in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, animated him with double Fires, and gave him almo&s;t a Confirmation of Victory.</P>
<P>Now clapping Spurs to his Hor&s;e he rode on with &s;uch eager Ha&s;te, that the noble Town of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> &s;oon appeared in View. There the Combat was to be performed, the Guards had already &s;urrounded the Li&s;ts, the Chal|lengers Trumpet had &s;ounded, and the unhap|py King, pale, trembling, and full of eager Anxiety, li&s;tened with a beating Heart, and fear-checked Wi&s;hes for an accepting An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mean time <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> having left the fright|ed <HI>Dalinda</HI> at an Inn, with repeated A&s;&s;u|rances of gaining her Pardon, in ca&s;e he van|qui&s;hed the Prince&s;s's Accu&s;er, advanced to|wards the City-gate: Here he was met by a young Page, who informed him that an un|known Knight, clad all in &s;able Armour, was arrived; that he had demanded the Combat with <HI>Lurcanio,</HI> and declared he would die, or
<PB N="250" REF="247">
free the Prince&s;s from her ignominious Sen|tence.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo,</HI> impatient to unfold the My&s;tery, thundered at the City-gates, which being open|ed, he rode eagerly to the Li&s;ts; there behold|ing the Combatants engaged, he forced his Way through the Pre&s;s, and crying aloud that they &s;hould cea&s;e the Fight, demanded an in|&s;tant Audience of the King.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hals of the Field thereupon parted the two Champions, and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> was imme|diately conducted to the King; to whom he related the whole Story of <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI>'s Treache|ry, as he had received it from <HI>Dalinda</HI>; adding that he would prove the Truth of it by Force of Arms, and begged he might be allowed to defy the Traitor Duke to &s;ingle Combat.</P>
<P>The noble Form of <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> but chiefly the plea&s;ing Purport of his Speech, gained him ab&s;olute Credit with the King. Scarce could the raptur'd Parent re&s;train the wild Exultings of his Joy at this Confirmation of his <HI>Geneu|ra</HI>'s Innocence; dearer than Life or Empire was &s;he loved by him, and freely would he have &s;acrificed both to &s;ave her Honour: He he&s;itated therefore not a Moment in permitting the reque&s;ted Combat, but ordered Duke <HI>Poly|ne&s;&s;o</HI> to be called.</P>
<P>He, by his Office of High Con&s;table, have|ing the ordering of the Combat, was riding proudly about the Field, exulting in his &s;uc|ce&s;sful
<PB N="251" REF="248">
Trea&s;on, and anticipating, in his own Mind, the Ruin of the fair and injured <HI>Geneura,</HI> ignorant though he was of the De&s;ign of this Summons, yet coward Guilt &s;ugge&s;ting the wor&s;t he had to fear, with a di&s;ordered Air, and Eyes expre&s;&s;ive of the various Apprehen|&s;ions that &s;truck his con&s;cious Soul, he met the reproachful Look of his King, and the fierce Glances of <HI>Rinaldo.</HI></P>
<P>That noble Warrior repeating in a few Words the Trea&s;ons he had been guilty of, challenged him to the Field: <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI> denied the Accu&s;ation, but accepting the proferred Combat, becau&s;e he could not avoid it, retired to arm him&s;elf, while <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> fraught with the pious Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings of the King, entered the Li&s;ts, and ordered his Trumpet to &s;ound.</P>
<P>At the third Bla&s;t the Duke appeared, pale Terror and Di&s;may were pictured in his Face, his fainting Heart throbbed with the con&s;cious Pangs of Guilt, and Horrors of impending Fate; confu&s;ed, di&s;tracted, not knowing what he did, he darted forwards at the Signal given to begin the Fight; but his weak Lance, ill-guided by his trembling hand, fell harmle&s;s to the Ground.</P>
<P>Not &s;o the great <HI>Rinaldo</HI>; he, with calm Courage, and Brave, yet una&s;&s;uming Con|fidence, meditated the Wound, and ri&s;ing all collected to the Blow, threw his famed Lance with &s;uch unerring Skill and Force, that it
<PB N="252" REF="249">
pierced quite through the Armour of <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI> and hid its fatal Point within his Side.</P>
<P>The Traitor fell, <HI>Rinaldo</HI> eagerly di&s;mount|ed and approaching him unlaced his Helmet. With faint low Voice he called for Mercy, and thinking to de&s;erve it, confe&s;&s;ed una&s;ked the Wrong he had been guilty of to <HI>Geneura</HI>; then as if Life had been only lent him till he had cleared her Innocence, &s;carce had he ut|tered another Prayer for Mercy, but Death &s;uppre&s;t the coward Supplication, and he lay a breathle&s;s Coar&s;e at the Feet of <HI>Rinaldo.</HI></P>
<P>The People tran&s;ported with Joy that their Prince&s;s was not only delivered from Death, but re&s;tored to her former &s;anctity of Charac|ter, made the Air re&s;ound with their Accla|mations.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo</HI> being conducted to the King, untied the Beaver of his Helmet, and was immediately known to be that famous Knight of <HI>Italy,</HI> who&s;e noble Exploits were noi&s;ed over all the habitable World.</P>
<P>The King embraced him in a rapture of Joy and Gratitude; the Nobles crouded round the Deliverer of their Prince&s;s, loaded him with Ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;trove to exceed each other in Prai&s;es of his invincible Valour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Congratulations over, all Eyes were turned upon the unknown Knight in black Armour, who had &s;o generou&s;ly undertaken
<PB N="253" REF="250">
the Defence of <HI>Geneura</HI> again&s;t her Accu&s;er <HI>Lurcanio</HI>; pen&s;ive he &s;tood during the Fight between <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI> and <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> his Eyes fixed upon the Combatants, with eager Attention he had li&s;tened to the dying Words of the treacherous Duke, and while the Multitude in loud &s;houts expre&s;&s;ed their Joy, and the King and Court were paying Honours to the glorious Victor, he &s;tood apart from the Throng, ab&s;orbed in Thought, and wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the Tumult around him.</P>
<P>The King cau&s;ed him to be conducted to his Pre&s;ence, and acknowledging him&s;elf greatly obliged to his generous Intention, pre&s;&s;ed him to let him know in what manner he could re|pay the Obligation.</P>
<P>The Knight made no An&s;wer, but bowing low, and throwing off his Helmet, the King and Court, with the utmo&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment, be|held the lovely Face of <HI>Ariodant</HI>; Wonder and Joy kept them all &s;ilent for a while; at length the King, recovering from his Surprize, cla&s;p'd the young Warrior to his Brea&s;t with a tender Embrace:</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, in a Tone of Voice expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;tronge&s;t Tran&s;port, that I behold again my <HI>Ariodant,</HI> the gallant Defend|er of my Dominions, and the brave Champion for my Daughter's Honour? him whom I la|mented as dead, whom my whole Kingdom mourned for, tell me by what &s;trange yet hap|py Chance I now behold thee living, who&s;e
<PB N="254" REF="251">
Death was &s;o confidently affirmed, and &s;o uni|ver&s;ally believed.</P>
<P><HI>Ariodant</HI> knowing the King was acquainted with the whole Story of his Love, replied without Re&s;erve:</P>
<P>The Pea&s;ant, my Lord, whom I detained to be a Witne&s;s of the &s;ad Effects of my De&s;pair, and to bring the News of it to the Prince&s;s, in|formed her truly that I ca&s;t my&s;elf from the Rock into the Sea, but that natural Repug|nance we have all to Death, when near, how|ever we may de&s;pi&s;e its Terrors at a Di&s;tance, impelled me, involuntarily, to u&s;e Mea&s;ures to pre&s;erve a Life which a Moment before I had been &s;o de&s;irous of lo&s;ing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I ro&s;e again upon the Surface of the Waves, I applied my&s;elf to &s;wimming, at which I was very expert, and &s;oon reached the neighbouring Shore, faint, weary, and almo&s;t breathle&s;s I threw my&s;elf down amid&s;t the Ru&s;hes, and was found in this Condition by an ancient Hermit, who&s;e Cell was at a &s;mall Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thither he conducted me, and in a few Days his charitable Cares re&s;tored me to my Strength; but alas! my Mind was tortur'd &s;till with va|rious Pa&s;&s;ions; Love, Hate, De&s;pair, and ea|ger Thir&s;t of Vengeance, by Turns po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me; in vain I &s;ought to bani&s;h the Idea of <HI>Ge|neura</HI> from my Soul, it &s;till returned with double Force; nor could her Infidelity, of
<PB N="255" REF="252">
which, mi&s;taken Wretch that I was, I thought I had &s;uch convincing Proofs, weaken the Power of her re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Charms.</P>
<P>Thus langui&s;hing, with a curele&s;s Wound, I heard the News of her Accu&s;ation by my Brother, and the Danger to which her Life and Honour were expo&s;ed: At that Moment, forgetting the Injuries I had &s;uffered, in&s;en&s;ible to all the Tyes of Con&s;anguinity and Friend|&s;hip, and only &s;olicitous for her Safety, I de|termined to fight with my Brother in her De|fence, plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the Thought, that if I did not free her, I &s;hould at le&s;t have the Satisfaction of dying in her Cau&s;e, and there|by proving how much Superior to <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI> was my Love, who though favoured as he was by her he wanted Courage to defend her.</P>
<P>Having provided my&s;elf with Armour that might effectually conceal me, I came hither full of Fury again&s;t my Brother, whom I could not but con&s;ider as my wor&s;t Enemy, &s;ince he was the Accu&s;er of the &s;till adored <HI>Geneura,</HI></P>
<P>The Arrival of the brave <HI>Rinaldo</HI> happily prevented the Continuance of a Combat, which mu&s;t have ended in the Death of one Brother, and eternal Remor&s;e to the other.</P>
<P>With Joy I behold the Prince&s;s delivered from the ignominious Death with which &s;he was threatened; but oh! with far more Rapture do I congratulate your Maje&s;ty on this Di&s;|covery of her Innocence: Happy <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> to
<PB N="256" REF="253">
be at once the Defender of her Life, and Re|&s;torer of her Honour: As for me I &s;ought only to pre&s;erve her from Death; and if that was denied me, to have the Satisfaction, at lea&s;t, of dying in her Defence, by the Hand of a Friend and Brother.</P>
<P>The King who loved him before for his Virtues, was &s;o charmed with this generous Proof of his Pa&s;&s;ion for his Daughter, that he ea&s;ily yielded to the Solicitations of <HI>Rinaldo</HI> and the Noblemen of his Court, to be&s;tow the Prince&s;s on &s;o faithful a Lover; and endowing her with the Dutchy of <HI>Albania,</HI> which, on <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI>'s Decea&s;e, reverted to the Crown, he gave her Hand to <HI>Ariodant</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Court, and the Nuptials were &s;oon after celebrated with the utmo&s;t Magnificence.</P>

<P><HI>Benedick</HI> then humourou&s;ly claiming <HI>Beatrice,</HI> both Marriages are agreed upon, and Don <HI>John</HI> who had fled upon News that his Treachery had been di&s;covered, is taken and brought back to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> to receive his Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="258">This Fable, ab&s;urd and ridiculous as it is, was drawn from the foregoing Story of <HI>Geneu|ra,</HI> in <HI>Ario&s;to</HI>'s <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o,</HI> a Fiction, which as it is managed by the Epic Poet, is neither improbable nor unnatural; but by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> mangled and defaced, full of Incon|&s;i&s;tencies, Contradictions, and Blunders. The defaming a Lady, by means of her Servant per|&s;onating her at her Chamber-window, is the Subject pur&s;ued by both.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> by changing the Per&s;ons, alter|ing &s;ome of the Circum&s;tances, and inventing others, has made the whole an improbable Con|trivance, borrowed ju&s;t enough to &s;hew his Po|verty of Invention, and added enough to prove his want of Judgment.</P>
<P>The Scheme for ruining the Lady in the O|riginal, is formed and executed by a rejected Lover, who &s;ees a Rival, his inferior in Rank and Fortune, preferred before him, and lo&s;es at once the Object of his Wi&s;hes, and the Pro|&s;pect of increa&s;ed Honours, by that Preference. Ambition, and the De&s;ire of Revenge, are Pa&s;&s;ions &s;trong enough in a Mind not very virtuous, to produce Acts of Ba&s;ene&s;s and Villainy. <HI>Polyne&s;&s;o,</HI> urged by tho&s;e powerful Incentives, contrives to blacken <HI>Geneura</HI>'s Fame, which produces a Separation between her and her Lover, and prevents a Stranger from marrying this Prince&s;s, and con&s;equently enjoying tho&s;e Honours, he &s;o ardently de&s;ired him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="259">Don <HI>John,</HI> in the Play, is a Villain merely through the Love of Villainy, and having en|tertained a capricious Di&s;like to <HI>Claudio,</HI> clo&s;es eagerly with his Confident's horrid Scheme for breaking off his Marriage with <HI>Hero.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent the multiplying &s;uch outrageou&s;ly wicked, and therefore unnatural Characters, Don <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf might have been the Pro|po&s;er of that black Contrivance again&s;t the in|nocent <HI>Hero,</HI> and <HI>Borachio,</HI> for the &s;ake of the thou&s;and Ducats that was afterwards given him by Don <HI>John,</HI> be induced to execute it: But here we have two Villains equally bad, both governed by the &s;ame dete&s;table Principles, acting upon the &s;ame Motives, and &s;uch a per|fect Parity in their Manners, that they are only di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by their Names.</P>
<P>When <HI>Borachio</HI> tells Don <HI>John</HI> to go to his Brother, and maintain confidently that <HI>Hero</HI> is a loo&s;e Wanton, Don <HI>John</HI> a&s;ks what Proof he &s;hall make of that?

<P><HI>Claudio</HI> only is the Object of Don <HI>John</HI>'s Hatred, yet the chief Force of rhe intended Injury is to fall on <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leonato</HI> her Father, towards whom he has no Malice; and he is made to engage in this wicked Enterprize, to procure the Ruin and Death of two Per&s;ons he
<PB N="263" REF="260">
hates not, to give a little Vexation to one he does. The&s;e Ab&s;urdities have their Ri&s;e from the injudicious Change of the Characters. The Contrivance to &s;lander <HI>Hero</HI> is not le&s;s ridicu|lous; and this al&s;o is occa&s;ioned by the Poet's having deviated from the Original to introduce his own wild Conceits.</P>
<P><HI>Borachio</HI> tells Don <HI>John,</HI> that he is highly fa|voured by <HI>Margaret, Hero</HI>'s waiting Woman; that he will per&s;uade her to dre&s;s in her Lady's Cloaths, a&s;&s;ume her Name, and talk to him out of her Chamber-window, all which Don <HI>Pedro</HI> and <HI>Claudio</HI> being Witne&s;&s;es of, would effectually convince them that <HI>Hero</HI> was di&s;ho|noured.</P>
<P>But <HI>Borachio</HI> does not acquaint Don <HI>John,</HI> and through him the Audience, what Colour he will give to this &s;trange Reque&s;t, in order to induce <HI>Margaret</HI> to grant it: <HI>Margaret</HI> is all along repre&s;ented as faithful to her Mi&s;tre&s;s; it was not likely &s;he would engage in a Plot that &s;eemed to have a Tendency to ruin <HI>Hero</HI>'s Reputation, unle&s;s &s;he had been impo&s;ed on by &s;ome very plau&s;ible Pretences, what tho&s;e Pre|tences were we are left to gue&s;s, which is in|deed &s;o difficult to do, that we mu&s;t rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e the Poet him&s;elf was as much at a Lo&s;s here as his Readers, and equally incapable of &s;olving the difficulty he had rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>That <HI>Borachio</HI> &s;hould be the &s;u&s;pected Gal|lant of <HI>Hero,</HI> is a Circum&s;tance al&s;o highly improbable. <HI>Borachio,</HI> a mean Dependant on
<PB N="264" REF="261">
a Man who&s;e Vices had made him the Object of univer&s;al Hatred and Contempt, a Stranger almo&s;t in <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and, as well on Account of the Meanne&s;s of his Situation, as the Profli|gacy of his Manners, excluded from any Ac|quaintanee with a Lady of <HI>Hero</HI>'s Quality.</P>
<P>Yet how ea&s;ily does Don <HI>Pedro</HI> the Friend, and <HI>Claudio</HI> the Lover of the Lady, &s;wallow this gro&s;s Scandal, that mu&s;t even derive Im|probability from the Per&s;on who utters it; for he is neither an hone&s;t Man nor a Friend of <HI>Claudio,</HI> who is thus &s;olicitous to prevent his di&s;honouring him&s;elf by marrying a bad Wo|man, but a Wretch noted for his Propen&s;ity to all Kinds of Mi&s;chief and Villainy, an invete|rate Hater of <HI>Claudio,</HI> and but a little while be|fore at open Enmity with Don <HI>Pedro</HI> his Bro|ther.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e Circum&s;tances were &s;ufficient to make the Prince and <HI>Claudio</HI> doubt the Truth of this Story, which the Character of the Tel|ler con&s;idered, as well as the Improbability of the Facts, &s;eemed much more likely to be con|trived to produce Mi&s;chief than prevent it.</P>
<P>The Proof Don <HI>John</HI> offers them in &s;upport of his A&s;&s;ertion, could have no Weight with Minds le&s;s &s;tupidly credulous than theirs; they are to be &s;hewn <HI>Hero</HI> talking to her Gallant <HI>Borachio</HI> out of her Chamber window, very unlikely that <HI>Hero</HI> &s;hould be &s;o imprudent, as the Night before her intended Marriage, to have an A&s;&s;ignation with a Gallant in &s;o

<P>We are not told that <HI>Margaret</HI> was &s;o very like her Lady, that in the &s;ame Cloaths they could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other; their Eyes are to be deceived by her Dre&s;s, but how if her Face happens, as certainly was the Ca&s;e, not to be exactly like <HI>Hero</HI>'s, it cannot be pretended that it was &s;o dark that they could not di&s;tingui&s;h her Features. The &s;ame Degree of Light that &s;hewed her Cloaths to be <HI>Hero</HI>'s would di&s;cover the Face to be <HI>Margaret</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Let it be granted, however, that their Sight was deceived (though, all Things con&s;idered, it is not po&s;&s;ible to conceive how) yet as they heard plainly all the Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the Counterfeit <HI>Hero</HI> and her Lover, why did not the Voice of <HI>Margaret</HI> di&s;cover the Cheat?

<P><HI>Dalinda</HI> willing to revive her Lover's decay|ing Pa&s;&s;ion by an Artifice that flattered her own Vanity, fondly agrees to his Propo&s;al, and for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nights, meets him at the u&s;ual Place of A&s;&s;ignation; which, was in the Prin|ce&s;&s;es Summer Apartment dre&s;t in her Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Polyne&s;&s;o</HI> having &s;ucceeded thus far, re|proaches <HI>Ariodant</HI> with his breach of Friend|&s;hip in addre&s;&s;ing <HI>Geneura,</HI> of who&s;e Affections he was in ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; <HI>Ariodant</HI> in&s;i&s;ts that him&s;elf is the favoured Lover, the Duke to convince him of the contrary, conducts him to a Place from whence he could &s;ee him a&s;|cend the Prince&s;&s;es Chamber.</P>

the Chamber Window, lets down the &s;ilken Cord to her Lover, and receives him with a tender Embrace, <HI>Ariodant</HI> maddening at this Sight, believes his Mi&s;tre&s;s fal&s;e; and <HI>Polyne&s;|&s;o</HI>'s Treachery produces all the Effects he could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Here the Contrivance is plau&s;ible enough, the Characters are properly di&s;tingui&s;hed, each acts upon Motives probable and natural, and the Incidents that follow are the nece&s;&s;ary Re|&s;ult of tho&s;e Actions. Why <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> re|jected the&s;e Circum&s;tances for others, wholly incon&s;i&s;tent and ridiculous, is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s; we &s;hall find him altering the &s;ucceeding Part of the Plot with the &s;ame utter di&s;regard to probability and contempt of Decorum.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret</HI> having done her Part towards de|faming her Mi&s;tre&s;s, without knowing any Thing of the Matter, though her Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Borachio</HI> was calculated to rai&s;e the mo&s;t in|jurious Su&s;picions; a&s;&s;i&s;ts her next Morning to dre&s;s for her Wedding, attends her to the Church, hears the de&s;igned Bridegroom refu&s;e her Hand, proclaim her a Wanton, and urge her la&s;t Night's loo&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Borachio</HI> from her Chamber Window as a Proof: Yet all the while &s;he appears wholly in&s;en&s;ible of what had happened, neither concerned for her Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom &s;he had ruined without De&s;ign, nor anxious for her own Safety, that &s;eemed to depend upon a candid Confe&s;&s;ion; for it was not likely her Treachery could be long con|cealed. Thus &s;upernaturally (if what is out
<PB N="268" REF="265">
of Nature may be called above it) is the Plot brought to perfection, nor is the unravelling of it le&s;s happily imagined.</P>
<P><HI>Borachio</HI> having received his promi&s;ed Ducats from Don <HI>John,</HI> the Moment after his Con|ference with <HI>Margaret</HI> was ended, meets an Acquaintance of his, named <HI>Conrade,</HI> in the Street, to whom he is impatient to communi|cate his good Luck.</P>
<P>'Tis true the Secret is of Importance, and if known, endangers his Life; the Place al&s;o is very improper for &s;uch a Conver&s;ation, being the Street, and near <HI>Leonato</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where the Scene of his Treachery had been acted; add to this that the Rain obliges them to &s;tand clo&s;e up to the Door, which expo&s;es them to the In|convenience of having even their Whi&s;pers overheard, if any one was near it: Yet &s;uch is <HI>Borachio</HI>'s extream eagerne&s;s to tell his wicked Exploit, that he never thinks of carrying his Friend to his own Lodgings, where he may boa&s;t in Safety, but in a rainy Night &s;tands in the Street, clo&s;e to the Door of the Man who&s;e Daughter he had injured, and there at his lei|&s;ure relates the whole treacherous Contrivance.</P>
<P>However, all this happens exactly right, be|cau&s;e the Watch who is po&s;ted about <HI>Leonato</HI>'s Hou&s;e, hear every Syllable, that is &s;poken, and under&s;tanding that one of the&s;e Villains had de|famed the Lady <HI>Hero,</HI> and made her intended Bridegroom re&s;olve to di&s;grace her the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Morning in Church, by publicly refu&s;ing to

marry her on account of her being di&s;honour|ed, they &s;ieze the two Wretches with an In|tent to bring them before <HI>Leonato,</HI> not that &s;ame Night to prevent the Lady's Di&s;grace, but the next Morning, when all was over, to di&s;cover her Innocence.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>LEIR,</HI> King of the BRITAINS, From <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI>'s Chronicle.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"LEIR</HI> the Son of <HI>Baldub,</HI> was admit|ted Ruler over the <HI>Britains,</HI> in the Year of the World 3105. At what Time <HI>Joas</HI> reigned as yet in <HI>Juda.</HI> This <HI>Leir</HI> was a Prince of noble Demeanor, governing his Land and Subjects in great Wealth. He made the Town of <HI>Cairleir</HI> now called <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> which &s;tandeth upon the River of <HI>Dore.</HI> It is
<PB N="274" REF="270">
writ that he had by his Wife three Daughters, without other I&s;&s;ue, who&s;e Names were, <HI>Go|norilla, Regan</HI> and <HI>Cordilla,</HI> which Daughters he greatly loved, but e&s;pecially the younge&s;t, <HI>Cordilla,</HI> far above the two Elder.</P>
<P>When this <HI>Leir</HI> was come to great Years, and began to wear unweildy through Age, he thought to under&s;tand the Affections of his Daughters towards him, and prefer her whom he be&s;t loved, to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the King|dom: Therefore, he fir&s;t a&s;ked <HI>Gonorilla</HI> the elde&s;t, how well &s;he loved him: the which calling her Gods to record, prote&s;ted that &s;he loved him more than her own Life, which by Right and Rea&s;on &s;hould be mo&s;t dear unto her, with which An&s;wer the Father being well plea&s;ed, turned to the &s;econd and demand|ed of her, how well &s;he loved him? which an&s;wered (confirming her Sayings with great Oaths) that &s;he loved him more than Tongue can expre&s;s, and far above all other Creatures in the World.</P>
<P>Then called he his younge&s;t Daughter <HI>Cordilla</HI> before him, and a&s;ked of her what ac|compt &s;he made of him: Unto whom &s;he made this An&s;wer as followeth: Knowing the great Love, and fatherly Zeal you have always borne towards me (for the which, that I may not an&s;wer you otherwi&s;e than I think, and as my Con&s;cience leadeth me) I prote&s;t to you, that I have always loved you, and &s;hall continually while I live, love you as my natural Father, and if you would more under&s;tand of the Love
<PB N="275" REF="271">
that I bear you, a&s;&s;ertayn your&s;elf, that &s;o much as you have, &s;o much you are worth, and &s;o much I love you, and no more.</P>
<P>The Father being nothing content with this An&s;wer, married the two elde&s;t Daughters, the one unto the Duke of <HI>Cornwall</HI> named <HI>Henninus,</HI> and the other unto the Duke of <HI>Albania</HI> called <HI>Maglanus,</HI> and betwixt them after his Death, he willed and ordained his Land &s;hould be divided, and the one half thereof &s;hould be immediately a&s;&s;igned unto them in Hand; but for the third Daughter <HI>Cordilla,</HI> he re&s;erved nothing.</P>
<P>Yet it fortuned that one of the Princes of <HI>Gallia</HI> (which now is called <HI>France</HI>) who&s;e Name was <HI>Aganippus,</HI> hearing of the Beauty, Womanhood and good Conditions of the &s;ayd <HI>Cordilla,</HI> de&s;ired to have her in Marriage, and &s;ent over to her Father, requiring that he might have her to Wife, to whom An&s;wer was made that he might have his Daughter; but for any Dowry he could have none, for all was promi&s;ed and a&s;&s;ured to her other Si&s;ters already.</P>
<P><HI>Aganippus,</HI> notwith&s;tanding this An&s;wer of Denyall to receive any Thing by way of Dower with <HI>Cordilla,</HI> took her to Wife, only moved thereto (I &s;ay) for re&s;pect of her Per&s;on and amiable Virtues. This <HI>Aganippus</HI> was one of the twelve Kings that ruled <HI>Gallia</HI> in tho&s;e Days, as in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory it is recorded. But to proceed, after that <HI>Leir</HI> was fallen into Age, the two Dukes, that had married his two

elde&s;t Daughters, thinking it long ere the Government of the Land did come to their Hands, aro&s;e again&s;t him in Armour, and re&s;t from him the Governance of the Land, upon Conditions to be continued for tearme of Life: By the which he was put to his Portion, that is, to live after a Rate a&s;&s;igned to him for the Maintenance of his E&s;tate, which in proce&s;s of Time was dimini&s;hed as well by <HI>Maglianus,</HI> as by <HI>Henninius.</HI></P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Grief that <HI>Leir</HI> took, was to &s;ee the Unkindne&s;s of his Daughters, who &s;eemed to think that all was too much which their Father had. The &s;ame being never &s;o little, in &s;o much that going from the one to the other, he was brought to that Mi&s;ery, that they would allow him only one Servant to wait upon him. In the End &s;uch was the un|kindne&s;s, or as I may &s;ay, the unnaturalne&s;s which he found in his two Daughters, notwith|&s;tanding their fair and plea&s;ant Words uttered in Time pa&s;t, that being con&s;trained of Nece&s;|&s;ity, he fled the Land and &s;ailed into <HI>Gallia,</HI> there to &s;eek &s;ome Comfort of his younge&s;t Daughter <HI>Cordeilla,</HI> whom before he hated.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Cordeilla</HI> hearing he was arrived in poor E&s;tate, &s;he fir&s;t &s;ent to him privately a Sum of Money to apparel him&s;elf withall, and to retain a certain Number of Servants, that might attend upon him in honorable Wi&s;e, as apperteyned to the E&s;tate which he had borne. And then &s;o accompanyed, &s;he appointed him to come to the Court, which he did, and was
<PB N="277" REF="273">
&s;o joyfully, honorably and lovingly received, both by his Son in Law <HI>Aganippus,</HI> and al&s;o by his Daughter <HI>Cordeilla,</HI> that his Heart was greatly comforted: For he was no le&s;s honour|ed, than if he had been King of the whole Country him&s;elf. Al&s;o after that, he had in|formed his Son in Law, and his Daughter, in what &s;ort he had been u&s;ed by his other Daugh|ters. <HI>Aganippus</HI> cau&s;ed a mighty Army to be put in readine&s;s, and likewi&s;e a great Navy of Ships to be rigged to pa&s;s over into <HI>Britain,</HI> with <HI>Leir</HI> his Father in Law, to &s;ee him again re&s;tored to his Kingdom.</P>
<P>It was accorded that <HI>Cordeilla</HI> &s;hould al&s;o go' with him to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Land, the which he promi&s;ed to leave unto her, as his rightful Inheritour after his Decea&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding any former Grants made unto her Si&s;ters, or unto their Hu&s;bands, in any Manner of wi&s;e, hereupon when this Army and Navy of Ships were ready, <HI>Leir</HI> and his Daughter <HI>Cordeilla</HI> with her Hu&s;band took the Sea, and arriving in <HI>Britain,</HI> fought with their Enemies, and di&s;comfitted them in Battle, in the which <HI>Maglanus</HI> and <HI>Henninus</HI> were &s;lain, and then was <HI>Leir</HI> re&s;tored to his Kingdom, which he ruled after this by the Space of two Years, and then died, forty Years after he fir&s;t began to reign: His Body was buried at <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> in a Vault under the Channel of the River <HI>Dore,</HI> beneath the Town."</P>

<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in a particularly tender Manner to <HI>Cordelia,</HI> his younge&s;t Daughter, he a&s;ks her what &s;he has to &s;ay, to draw a Dowry more opulent than her Si&s;ters. <HI>Cordelia</HI> tells him, Nothing; the King &s;urpri|&s;ed bids her &s;peak again, &s;he with a mode&s;t plainne&s;s replies: That &s;he loves him as a du|tiful Child ought to love an indulgent Father, neither more nor le&s;s.</P>
<P>The King enraged at this Speech, bids her avoid his Pre&s;ence, declares that he will bani&s;h her for ever from his Heart, and divides that Portion of his Kingdom, which he had de&s;ign'd for her, between her two Si&s;ters.

<P>The old King, in an agony of Grief and Rage at this barbarous and unnatural Treat|ment from his two Daughters, to whom he had given all, ru&s;hes out of the Ca&s;tle, declar|ing he will not &s;tay under the &s;ame Roof with them. They, who de&s;ire nothing &s;o much as his Ab&s;ence, command the Earl of <HI>Glo&s;ter</HI> to &s;hut his Gates, and &s;uffer him to go whi|ther he plea&s;es.

The wicked Prince&s;&s;es peremptorily forbid him to afford their Father any Relief, and threaten'd him with Death if he Di&s;obeys.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, the Earl &s;ecretly &s;eeks for the King, who&s;e Griefs had now turned

<P>This Fable, although drawn from the fore|going Hi&s;tory of King <HI>Lear,</HI> is &s;o altered by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in &s;everal Circum&s;tances, as to render it much more improbable than the Ori|ginal: There we are &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;ted with the Folly of a Man, who gives away one Half of his Kingdom to two of his Daughters, be|cau&s;e they flatter him with Profe&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t extravagant Love; and deprives his younge&s;t Child of her Portion for no other Crime but confining her Expre&s;&s;ions of Ten|derne&s;s within the Bounds of plain and &s;imple Truth.</P>
<P>But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has carried this Extrava|gance much farther; he &s;hews us a King re|&s;igning his Kingdom, his Crown and Dignity to his two Daughters; re&s;erving nothing to him&s;elf, not even a decent Maintenance; but &s;ubmitting to a mean Dependance on the Bounty of his Children; whom, by promi&s;ing Rewards proportionable to the Degree of Flat|tery they lavi&s;h on him, he has &s;timulated to outvie each other in artful Flouri&s;hes on their Duty and Affection toward him.</P>

<P>Thus he &s;ugge&s;ted to her a Motive for ex|ceeding them in Expre&s;&s;ions of Love: the no|ble Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of her An&s;wer afforded the &s;tronge&s;t Conviction of her Sincerity, and that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Degree of filial Affection for him, who hazarded the Lo&s;s of all her Fortune to confine her&s;elf to &s;imple Truth in her Profe&s;&s;ions of it: yet, for this, <HI>Lear</HI> bani&s;hes her his Sight, con&s;igns her over to Want, and loads her with the deepe&s;t Im|precations.

The Lover who is made to Marry the di&s;inherited <HI>Cordelia</HI> on account of her Virtue, is very injudiciou&s;ly contrived to be Ab&s;ent when &s;he gave &s;o glori|ous a Te&s;timony of it, and is touch'd by a cold Ju&s;tification of her Fame, and that from her&s;elf, when he might have been charm'd with a &s;hining In&s;tance of her Greatne&s;s of Soul, and inviolable Regard to Truth.</P>
<P>So unartfully has the Poet managed this In|cident, that <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s noble Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s is apparent to all but him who was to be the mo&s;t influenced by it. In the Eyes of her Lo|ver &s;he is deba&s;ed, not exalted; reduced to the abject Nece&s;&s;ity of defending her own Charac|ter, and &s;eeking rather to free her&s;elf from the Su&s;picion of Guilt, than mode&s;tly enjoying the con&s;cious Sen&s;e of &s;uperior Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Lear</HI>'s Invective again&s;t her to the King of <HI>France</HI> is conceived in the mo&s;t &s;hocking Terms.</P>
<Q><L>I would not from your Love make &s;uch a &s;tray,</L>
<L>To Match you where I Hate; therefore be|&s;eech you,</L>
<L>T'avert your Liking a more worthy Way,</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="284">Than on a Wretch, whom Nature is a&s;ham'd</L>

<P>Well might the King of <HI>France</HI> be &s;tartled at &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e from a Parent of his Child; had he been pre&s;ent to have heard the Offence &s;he gave him to occa&s;ion them, how mu&s;t her exalted Merit have been endeared to him by the extream Inju&s;tice &s;he &s;uffered; but as it is, a bare Acquittal of any mon&s;terous Crime, is all the Satisfaction &s;he can procure for her&s;elf; and all the Foundation her Lover has for the Eulogium he afterwards makes on her.</P>

<P>From this Speech of <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s, and <HI>Lear</HI>'s An&s;wer, <HI>France</HI> collects Matter for extenuating

a &s;uppo&s;ed Error in his Mi&s;tre&s;s, not for Ad|miration of her Worth.</P>

<L>Is it but this? a Tardine&s;s in Nature,</L>
<L>Which often leaves the Hi&s;tory un&s;poke,</L>
<L>That it intends to do.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Yet a Moment after, without knowing any more of the Matter, he lavi&s;hes the warme&s;t Prai&s;es on her Virtues, and offers to make her (loaded as &s;he is with her Father's Cur&s;es, and deprived of the Dower he expected with her) Queen of <HI>France.</HI> This Conduct would be ju&s;t and natural, had he been a Witne&s;s of her noble Behaviour; but doubtful as it mu&s;t have appeared to him in &s;uch perplexing Circum|&s;tances, 'tis extravagant and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has deviated widely from Hi&s;tory in the Cata&s;trophe of his Play; the Chronicle tells us, that King <HI>Lear</HI> having been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed by his rebellious Sons in Law of that Half of the Kingdom which he had re&s;erved for him&s;elf, and forced, by repeated Indignities from his Daughters, to take Refuge in <HI>France,</HI> was received with great Tenderne&s;s by <HI>Cordelia,</HI> who prevailed upon her Hu&s;band to attempt his Re&s;toration; accordingly an Army of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> pa&s;s'd over into <HI>Britain,</HI> by which, the Dukes of <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Albany</HI> being defeat|ed, King <HI>Lear</HI> was re&s;tored to his Crown, died in Peace two Years after, and left his King|dom to <HI>Cordelia.</HI> In <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> the Forces of the two wicked Si&s;ters are victorious, <HI>Lear</HI> and the pious <HI>Cordelia</HI> are taken Pri&s;oners, &s;he is hanged in Pri&s;on, and the old King dies with Grief. Had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> followed the Hi&s;|torian,
<PB N="291" REF="286">
he would not have violated the Rules of poetical Ju&s;tice; he repre&s;ents Vice puni&s;h|ed, and Virtue rewarded; in the Play one Fate overwhelms alike the Innocent and the Guilty, and the Facts in the Hi&s;tory are wholly changed to produce Events, neither probable, nece&s;&s;ary, nor ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Several Incidents in this Play, are borrowed from the Hi&s;tory of the old Prince of <HI>Paphlago|nia,</HI> in <HI>Sidney</HI>'s <HI>Arcadia,</HI> which I &s;hall here Tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P>"IT was in the Kingdom of <HI>Galacia,</HI> the Sea&s;on being (as in the Depth of Winter) very cold, and as then &s;odainly Grown to &s;o extream and foul a Storm, that never any Winter, I think, brought forth a fowler Child; &s;o that the Princes were even compelled by the Hail, that the Pride of the Wind blew in their Faces, to &s;eek &s;ome &s;hrowding Place, which a certain hollow Rock offering unto them, they made it their Shield again&s;t the Tempe&s;t's Fu|ry: And &s;o &s;taying there till the Violence thereof was pa&s;&s;ed, they heard the Speech of a Couple, who not perceiving them, being hid within the rude Canupie, held a &s;trange and pitiful Di&s;putation, which made them Step out, yet in &s;uch Sort, as they might &s;ee un&s;een.</P>
<P>There they perceived an aged Man, and a young, &s;carcely come to the Age of a Man; both poorly arrayed, extreamly Weather-beat|en; the old Man blind, the young Man lead|ing him; and yet through all the&s;e Mi&s;eries, in both there &s;eemed to appear a Kind of No|blene&s;s, not &s;uitable to that Affliction: But the
<PB N="292" REF="287">
fir&s;t Words they heard were the&s;e of the old Man.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Leonatus,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;ince I cannot per|&s;uade thee to lead me to that which &s;hould end my Grief, and thy Trouble, let me now in|treat thee to leave me: Fear not, my Mi&s;ery cannot be greater than it is, and nothing doth become me but Mi&s;ery. Fear not the Danger of my blind Steps, I cannot Fall wor&s;e than I am, and do not, I pray thee, do not ob&s;ti|nately continue to infect thee with my Wretch|edne&s;s, but fly, fly from this Region, only worthy of me.</P>
<P>Dear Father, an&s;wered he, do not take a|way from me the only Remnant of my Happi|ne&s;s, while I have Power to do you Service, I am not wholly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Ah my Son, &s;aid he, and with that he groan|ed, as if Sorrow &s;trove to break his Heart, how evil fits it me to have &s;uch a Son, and how much doth thy Kindne&s;s upbraid my Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e doleful Speaches, and &s;ome others to like Purpo&s;e (well &s;hewing they had not been born to the Fortune they were in) moved the Princes to go out unto them, and a&s;k the younger, who they were?</P>
<P>Sirs, an&s;wered he with a good Grace, and made the more agreeable by a certain noble Kind of Piteou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;ee well you are Stran|gers, that know not our Mi&s;ery, &s;o well here known, that no Man dare know but that we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable; indeed our State is &s;uch, as though nothing is &s;o needful unto us as Pity, yet nothing is more dangerous unto us, than to make our&s;elves &s;o known as may &s;tir Pity;
<PB N="293" REF="288">
but your Pre&s;ence promi&s;eth, that Cruelty &s;hall not over-run Hate, and if it did, in Truth our State is &s;unk below the Degree of Fear. This old Man whom I lead, was lately rightful Prince of this Country of <HI>Paphlagonia</HI>; by the hard-hearted Ungratefulne&s;s of a Son of his, de|prived not only of his Kingdom, whereof no foreign Forces were even able to &s;poile him, but of his Sight, the Riches which Nature grants to the poore&s;t Creatures; whereby, and by other his unnatural Dealings, he hath been driven to &s;uch Grief, as even now he would have had me to have led him to the Top of this Rock, thence to ca&s;t him&s;elf head|long to Death, and &s;o would have made me, who received my Life of him, to be the Worker of his De&s;truction. But noble Gen|tlemen, &s;aid he, if either of you have a Fa|ther, and feel what dutiful Affection is in|grafted in a Son's Heart, let me entreat you to convey this afflicted Prince to &s;ome Place of Re&s;t and Security; among&s;t your worthy Acts it &s;hall be none of the lea&s;t, that a King of of &s;uch Might and Fame, and &s;o unju&s;tly op|pre&s;&s;ed, is in any Sort by you relieved.</P>
<P>But before they could make him An&s;wer, his Father began to Speak: Ah my Son, &s;aid he, how evil an Hi&s;torian are you, that leave out the chief Knot of all the Di&s;cour&s;e? My Wickedne&s;s, my Wickedne&s;s; and if thou doe&s;t it to &s;pare my Eares, the only Sen&s;e now left me proper for Knowledge, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf thou doe&s;t mi&s;take me: And I take Witne&s;s of that Sun which you &s;ee, with that he ca&s;t up his blind Eyes, as if he would Hunt for Light,
<PB N="294" REF="289">
and wi&s;h my&s;elf in wor&s;e Ca&s;e than I do wi&s;h my&s;elf, which is as Evill as may be, if I Speak untruly, that nothing is &s;o welcome to my Thoughts, as the publi&s;hing of my Shame. Therefore know you Gentlemen (to whom from my Heart I wi&s;h that it may not prove &s;ome o|minous Foretoken of Misfortune to have met with &s;uch a Mi&s;er as I am) that what&s;oever my Son (o God that Truth binds me to Reproach him with the Name of my Son) hath &s;aid is true. But be&s;ides tho&s;e Truthes, this al&s;o is true, that having had in lawful Marriage, of a Mo|ther fit to bear Royal Children, this Son (&s;uch a one as partly you &s;ee, and better &s;hall know by my &s;hort Declaration) and &s;o enjoyed the Expectations in the World of him till he was grown to ju&s;tilfy their Expectations, &s;o as I needed envy no Father for the chief Comfort of Mortality, to leave another ones-&s;elf after me. I was carried by a Ba&s;tard Son of mine, if at lea&s;t I be bound to believe the Words of that ba&s;e Woman my Concubine, his Mother, fir&s;t to mi&s;like, then to hate, la&s;tly to de&s;troy, or to do my be&s;t to de&s;troy this Son, I think, you think unde&s;erving De&s;truction; what Ways he u&s;ed to bring me to it, if I &s;hould tell you, I &s;hould tediou&s;ly trouble you with as much poi&s;onous Hypocri&s;y, de&s;perate Fraud, &s;mooth Malice, hidden Ambition, and &s;miling Envy, as in any living Per&s;on could be har|bour'd: But I li&s;t it not, no Remembrance of Naughtine&s;s delights me but mine own, and methinks the accu&s;ing his Traps, might in &s;ome Manner excu&s;e my Fault, which certainly I loth to do. But the Conclu&s;ion is, that I
<PB N="295" REF="290">
gave Orders to &s;ome Servants of mine, whom I thought as apt for &s;uch Charities as my&s;elf, to lead him out into a Forre&s;t, and there to kill him: But tho&s;e Thieves, better natured to my Son than my&s;elf, &s;pared his Life, letting him go to learn to live poorly, which he did, giving him&s;elf to be a private Soldier in a Country here by; but as he was ready to be greatly advanced for &s;ome noble Pieces of Ser|vice which he did, he heard News of me, who (Drunk in my Affection to that unlawful and unnatural Son of mine) &s;uffered my&s;elf to be governed by him, that all Favours and Puni&s;h|ments pa&s;&s;ed by him, all Offices and Places of Importance di&s;tributed to his Favourites; &s;o that ere I was aware, I had left my&s;elf no|thing but the Name of King, which he &s;hortly weary of too, with many Indignities (if any Thing may be called an Indignity which was laid upon me) threw me out of my Seat, and put out my Eyes; and then proud in his Ty|ranny let me go, neither impri&s;oning, nor killing me, but rather delighting to make me feel my Mi&s;ery; Mi&s;ery indeed, if ever there were any, full of Wretchedne&s;s, full of Di&s;|grace, and fulle&s;t of Guiltine&s;s. And as he came to the Crown by &s;o unju&s;t Means, as un|ju&s;tly he kept it, by Force of Stranger Soldiers in Cittadels, the Ne&s;ts of Tyranny, and Mur|derers of Liberty; di&s;arming all his own Coun|trymen, that no Man dur&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf a well willer of mine, to &s;ay the Truth, I think few of them being &s;o, con&s;idering my cruel Folly to my good Son, and fooli&s;h Kindne&s;s to my unkind Ba&s;tard; but if there were any
<PB N="296" REF="291">
who felt a Pity for &s;o great a Fall, and had yet any Sparks of un&s;taine Duty left in them to|wards me; yet dur&s;t they not &s;hew it, &s;carcely with giving me Alms at their Doors, which yet was the only Su&s;tenance of my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Life, nobody daring to &s;hew &s;o much Charity as to lend me a Hand to guide my dark Steps; till this Son of mine, God knows, worthy of a more virtuous, and more fortunate Father, forgetting my abominable Wrongs, not reck|ing Danger, and neglecting the pre&s;ent good Way he was in of doing him&s;elf good, came hither to do this kind Office you &s;ee him per|form towards me, to my un&s;peakable Grief; not only becau&s;e his Kindne&s;s is a Gla&s;s even to my blind Eyes of my Naughtine&s;s; but that above all Griefs, it grieves me he &s;hould de&s;pe|rately adventure the lo&s;s of his well de&s;erving Life for mine, that yet owe more to Fortune for my De&s;erts, as if he would carry Mudde in a Che&s;t of Chry&s;tal; for well I know, he that now reign|eth, how much &s;oever (and with good Rea&s;on) he de&s;pi&s;eth me, of all Men de&s;pi&s;ed; yet he will not let &s;lip any Advantage to make away him who&s;e ju&s;t Title, enobled by Courage and Goodne&s;s, may one Day &s;hake the Seat of a never &s;ecure Tyranny; and for this Cau&s;e I craved of him to lead me to the Top of this Rock, indeed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, with meaning to free him from &s;o Serpentine a Companion as I am; but he finding what I purpo&s;ed, only therein, &s;ince he was born, &s;hewed him&s;elf di&s;|obedient to me: And now, Gentlemen, you have the true Story, which, I pray you, publi&s;h to the World, that my mi&s;chievious Proceedings may be the Glory of his filial Piety, the only Re|ward
<PB N="297" REF="292">
now left for &s;o great a Merit; and if it may be, let me obtain that of you which my Son denies me, for never was there more Pity in &s;aving any than in ending me; both becau&s;e therein my Agony &s;hall end, and &s;o you &s;hall pre&s;erve this excellent young Man, who el&s;e wilfully follows his own Ruin.</P>
<P>The Matter, in it&s;elf lamentable, lament|ably expre&s;&s;ed by the old Prince, which needed not take to him&s;elf the Ge&s;tures of Pity, &s;ince his Face could not put off the Marks thereof, greatly moved the two Princes to Compa&s;&s;ion, which could not &s;tay in &s;uch Hearts as theirs without &s;eeking Remedy: But, by and by, the Occa&s;ion was pre&s;ented; for <HI>Plexirtus</HI> (&s;o was the Ba&s;tard called) came thither with forty Hor&s;e, only of purpo&s;e to murder this Bro|ther, of who&s;e coming he had &s;oon Adverti&s;e|ment; and thought no Eyes of &s;ufficient Cre|dit in &s;uch a Matter but his own, and therefore come him&s;elf to be Actor and Spectator: and, as &s;oon as he came, not regarding the weak (as he thought) Guard of but two Men, com|manded &s;ome of his Followers to &s;et their Hands to his in the killing of <HI>Leonatus</HI>; but the young Prince (though not otherwi&s;e armed but with a Sword) how fal&s;ely &s;oever he was dealt with by others, would not betray him|&s;elf; but bravely drawing it our, made the Death of the fir&s;t that a&s;&s;ailed him, warn his Followers to come more warily after him. But then <HI>Pyrocles</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> were quickly be|come Parties (&s;o ju&s;t a Defence de&s;erving as much as old Friend&s;hip) and &s;o did behave them among that Company (more injurious than
<PB N="298" REF="293">
valiant) that many of them lo&s;t their Lives for their wicked Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Yet, perhaps, had the Number of them at la&s;t prevailed, if the King of <HI>Pontus</HI> (lately by them made &s;o) had not come unlooked for to their Succour; who (having had a Dream, which had fixed his Imagination vehemently upon &s;ome great Danger, pre&s;ently to follow tho&s;e two Princes whom he mo&s;t dearly loved was come in all Ha&s;te, following, as well as he could, their Track, with an Hundred Hor&s;es, in that Country, which he thought (con&s;idering who then reigned) a fit Place enough to make the Stage of any Tragedy.</P>
<P>But then the Match had been &s;o ill made for <HI>Plexertus,</HI> that his ill-led Life, and wor&s;e-got|ten Honour, &s;hould have tumbled together to De&s;truction, had there not come in <HI>Tydeus</HI> and <HI>Telenor,</HI> with forty or fifty in their Suit, to the Defence of <HI>Plexirtus.</HI> The&s;e two were Bro|thers, of the noble&s;t Hou&s;e of that Country, brought up from their Infancy with <HI>Plexirtus</HI>; Men of &s;uch Prowe&s;s as not to know Fear in them&s;elves, and yet to teach it in others that &s;hould deal with them: for they had often made their Lives triumph over mo&s;t terrible Dan|gers; never di&s;mayed, and ever fortunate; and, truly, no more &s;ettled in Valour than di&s;|po&s;ed to Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice; if either they had lighted on a better Friend, or could have learned to make Friend&s;hip a Child, and not a Father of Virtue: But bringing up (rather the Choice) having fir&s;t knit their Minds unto him (indeed crafty enough, either to hide his Faults or never to &s;hew them, but when they
<PB N="299" REF="294">
might pay home) they willingly held out the Cour&s;e, rather to &s;atisfy him than all the World; and rather to be good Friends than good Men; &s;o as though they did not like the Evil he did, yet they liked him that did the Evil; and though not Coun&s;ellors of the Of|fence, yet Protectors of the Offender.</P>
<P>Now they having heard of this &s;udden going out with &s;o &s;mall a Company in a Country full of evil-wi&s;hing Minds toward him (though they knew not the Cau&s;e) followed him, till they found him in &s;uch Ca&s;e as they were to venture their Lives, or el&s;e he to lo&s;e his, which they did with &s;uch Force of Mind and Body, that, truly, I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, <HI>Pyrocles</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> had never till then found any that could make them &s;o well repeat their harde&s;t Le&s;&s;on in the Feats of Arms: And, briefly, &s;o they did, that if they overcame not, were they not overcome; but carried away that ungrateful Ma&s;ter of theirs to a Place of Security: how&s;oever, the Princes laboured to the contrary.</P>
<P>But this Matter being thus far begun, it be|came not the Con&s;tancy of the Princes &s;o to leave it, but in all Ha&s;te making Forces both in <HI>Pontus</HI> and <HI>Phrygia,</HI> they had in few Days left him but only that one &s;trong Place where he was; for Fear having been the only Knot that had fa&s;tened his People unto him, that once untied by a greater Force, they all &s;cattered from him like &s;o many Birds who&s;e Cage had been broken.</P>
<P>In which Sea&s;on the blind King, having, in the chief City of his Realm, &s;et the Crown upon his Son <HI>Leonatus</HI>'s Head, with many
<PB N="300" REF="295">
Tears, both of Joy and Sorrow, &s;etting forth to the whole People his own Fault and his Son's Virtue, after he had ki&s;&s;ed him, and forced his Son to accept Honour of him, as of his new become Subject, even in a Moment died; as it &s;hould &s;eem, his Heart, broken with Unkindne&s;s and Affliction, &s;tretched &s;o far beyond his Limits with this Exce&s;s of Comfort, as it was no longer able to keep &s;afe his vital Spirits.</P>
<P>But the new King, having no le&s;s lovingly performed all Duties to him dead, than alive, pur&s;ued on the Siege of his unnatural Brother, as much for the Revenge of his Father, as for the e&s;tabli&s;hing his own Quiet."</P>
<P>The under plot of <HI>Glo&s;ter</HI> and his two Sons, in the Tragedy of King <HI>Lear,</HI> is borrowed from this foregoing &s;hort Hi&s;tory of <HI>Leonatus</HI>; &s;everal of the Circum&s;tances clo&s;ely copied; and the Characters of the Brothers nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Adventure of the Rock is heightened by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>; perhaps with too little Atten|tion to Probability. <HI>Glo&s;ter,</HI> though deprived of Sight, might ea&s;ily be &s;en&s;ible of the Differ|ence between walking on a level Plain, and a&s;cending a &s;leep and craggy Rock; nor could he po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e, when he fell gently on that Plain, that he had precipitated him&s;elf from an immen&s;e Height to the Margin of the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in the pathetic De&s;cription he makes <HI>Edgar</HI> give of his Father's Death, had certainly the following Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Arcadia</HI> in his Eye. "The blind King having in the chief City of his Realm &s;et the Crown upon his Son <HI>Leonatus</HI>'s Head, with many Tears,

<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that this Writer, &s;ince he was re&s;olved not to exceed a certain Length in his Introduction, had omitted &s;ome Part of it, in order to introduce tho&s;e Circum&s;tances that were of infinitely more Con&s;equence than any thing el&s;e he has &s;aid on the Subject of that old Ballad: if it was really written before <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s Play, that great Poet did not di&s;dain to con&s;ult it, but has copied it more clo&s;ely than either the Chronicle or <HI>Sidney.</HI> From thence (for 'tis mentioned no where el&s;e) he took the Hint of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madne&s;s, and the extravagant and wanton Cruelty his Daughters exerci&s;ed on him; the Death of King <HI>Lear</HI> is al&s;o exactly copied.</P>
<P><HI>Spencer</HI> &s;eems to have furni&s;hed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with the Hint of <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s Manner of Death: In the tenth Canto of the &s;econd Book of his <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> he relates the Story of King <HI>Lear</HI> and his three Daughters; <HI>Cordelia,</HI> he tells us, after having re&s;tored her Father to his Crown, and &s;ucceeded to it after his Death, was by her Si&s;ter's Children dethroned, and confined a long Time in Pri&s;on, &s;o that, over|come by De&s;pair, &s;he hanged her&s;elf. In <HI>Shake&s;pear Cordelia</HI> does not hang her&s;elf, but is hanged by a Soldier; a very improper Ca|ta&s;trophe for a Per&s;on of &s;uch exemplary Virtue.</P>
<P>The following is the old Ballad I have men|tioned, which bears &s;o exact an Analogy to the
<PB N="303" REF="298">
Argument of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s King <HI>Lear,</HI> that his having copied it cannot be doubted, if indeed it be true, that it was written before that Tragedy.</P>

<L>KIng <HI>Leir</HI> once ruled in this Land,</L>
