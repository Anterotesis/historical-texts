To Charles Egerton, E&s;q.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O! yes&mdash;yes&mdash;that is for Ma&s;ter Charles, John, for he has drop! his fathers name of Mac Syco|phant, and has taken up that of Egerton.&mdash;The Par|liament has ordered it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Parliament! pry'thee why &s;o, Mrs. Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you mu&s;t know, John, that my Lady, his mother, was an Egerton by her father; &s;he &s;tole a match with our old ma&s;ter, for which all her fa|mily, on both &s;ides, have hated Sir Pertinax, and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>Except Ma&s;ter Charles, Mrs. Betty.</P>

<P>O! they doat upon him, for tho' he be a Mac Sycophant, he's the pride of all my Lady's fa|mily.&mdash;And &s;o, John, my Lady's uncle, Sir Stanley Egerton, dying an old batchelor, and, as I &s;aid before, mortally hating our old ma&s;ter, and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants, le&s;t his whole e&s;tate to Ma&s;ter Charles, who was his God-&s;on; but on condition tho', that he &s;hou'd drop his fathers name of Mac Sycophant, and take up that of Egerton, and that is the rea&s;on, John, why the Parliament has made him change his name.</P>
</SP>

<P>I am glad that Ma&s;ter Charles has got the e&s;tate however, for he is a &s;weet tempered gentleman.</P>

<P>As ever lived, but come, John, as I know you love Mi&s;s Con&s;tantia, and are fond of an oppor|tunity of &s;peaking to her, I will make you happy, you &s;hall carry her letter to her.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="6">
about with no&s;egays and fruit, and the fir&s;t of every thing in the &s;ea&s;on; ay, and my young Ma&s;ter Charles too, he is in as bad a way as the gardiner&mdash;in &s;hort, every body loves her, and that is one rea&s;on why I hate her:&mdash;for my part, I wonder what the deuce the men &s;ee in her&mdash;a creature that was taken in for charity&mdash;I am &s;ure &s;he is not &s;o hand&s;ome&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;he was out of the family once, if &s;he was, I might then &s;tand a chance of being my Lady's favourite my&s;elf; ay, and perhaps of getting one of my young Ma&s;ters for a &s;weetheart&mdash;or at lea&s;t, the Chaplain&mdash;But as to him, there would be no &s;uch great catch, if I &s;hould get him&mdash;I will try for him however; and my fir&s;t &s;tep &s;hall be, to let the Doctor know all I have di&s;covered about Con&s;tantia's intrigues with her &s;park at Hadley&mdash;Yes, that will do, for the Doctor loves to talk with me, and always &s;miles and jokes with me
<STAGE>(<HI>laughs</HI>)</STAGE>
he, he,&mdash;he loves to hear me talk too, and I verily believe he, he, he, that he has a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for me! be&s;ides, this &s;tory will make him have a good opinion of my hone&s;ty, and that I am &s;ure will be one &s;tep to|wards it.&mdash;O ble&s;s me! here he comes, and my young Ma&s;ter with him&mdash;I'll watch an opportunity to &s;peak to him, as &s;oon as he is alone, for I will blow her up, I am re&s;olved, as great a favourite, and as cunning as &s;he is.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, dear Charles, but why are you &s;o impe|tuous? Why do you break from me &s;o abruptly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done, Sir&mdash;You have refu&s;ed&mdash;I have nothing more to &s;ay upon the &s;ubject&mdash;I am &s;atisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Spoke with a glow of tender friend&s;hip.</HI>)</STAGE>
Come, come, correct this warmth; it is the only weak in|gredient in your nature; and you ought to watch it carefully; if I am wrong, I will &s;ubmit without re|&s;erve; but con&s;ider the nature of your reque&s;t, and how it would affect me. From your earlie&s;t Youth
<PB N="7" REF="7">
your Father has honoured me with the care of your Education, and the general conduct of your mind; and however &s;ingular and moro&s;e his behaviour may be towards others, to me he has ever been re&s;pectful and liberal. I am now under his roof too&mdash;and becau&s;e I will not abet an unwarrantable pa&s;&s;ion, by an abu&s;e of my &s;acred character, in marrying you beneath your rank, and in direct oppo&s;ition to your Father's hopes and happine&s;s&mdash;you blame&mdash;you angrily break from me, and call me unkind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>With kindne&s;s and conviction.</HI>)</STAGE>
Dear Sidney, for my warmth I &s;tand condemned; but for my mar|riage with Con&s;tantia, I think I can ju&s;tify it upon every principle of filial duty, honour and worldly pru|dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only make that appear, Charles, and you know you may command me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible how unworthy it appears in a Son to de&s;cant on the unamiable pa&s;&s;ions of a Father; but as we are alone, and friends, I cannot help ob|&s;erving, in my own defence, that when a Father will not allow the u&s;e of rea&s;on to any of his Family&mdash;when his pur&s;uit of greatne&s;s makes him a &s;lave abroad&mdash;only to be a tyrant at home&mdash;when his narrow partiality to Scotland, on every trivial occa&s;ion, pro|vokes him to enmity even with his Wife and Children, only becau&s;e they dare give a national preference where they think it is mo&s;t ju&s;tly due&mdash;and when merely to gratify his own ambition, he would marry his Son into a family he dete&s;ts.
<STAGE>(<HI>With great warmth.</HI>)</STAGE>
Sure, Sidney, a Son thus circum&s;tanced (from the dignity of human nature, and the feelings of a loving heart) has a right, not only to prote&s;t again&s;t the blindne&s;s of the Parent, but to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures, that virtue and happine&s;s point out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>The violent temper of Sir Pertinax, I own, cannot on many occa&s;ions be defended&mdash;but &s;till your intended alliance with Lord Lumbercourt.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! contemptible! A trifling, quaint, haughty, voluptuous! &s;ervile tool!&mdash;the mere lackey of party and corruption; who for the pro&s;titution of near
<PB N="8" REF="8">
thirty years, and the ruin of a noble fortune, has had the de&s;picable &s;atisfaction, and the infamous honour, of being kicked up, and kicked down, kicked in, and kicked out&mdash;ju&s;t as the in&s;olence, compa&s;&s;ion, or con|veniency of leaders predominated; and now, being for&s;aken by all parties, his whole political con&s;equence amounts to, the power of franking a letter, and the right honourable priviledge of not paying a Trade&s;man's bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, dear Charles, you are not to wed my Lord, but his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is as di&s;agreeable for a companion, as her Father is for a friend or an ally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! What, her Scotch accent, I &s;uppo&s;e, offends you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;upon my honour&mdash;not in the lea&s;t, I think it entertaining in her, but were it otherwi&s;e, in decency&mdash;and, indeed, in national affection (being a Scotchman my&s;elf) I can have no objection to her on that account&mdash;be&s;ides, &s;he is my near relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I under&s;tand&mdash;but how comes Lady Rodol|pha, who, I find, was born in England, to be bred in Scotland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the dotage of an old, formal, ob&s;ti|nate, &s;tiff, rich, Scotch Grandmother; who, upon a promi&s;e of leaving this Grandchild all her fortune, which is very con&s;iderable, wou'd have the Girl &s;ent to her to Scotland, when &s;he was but a year old; and there has &s;he been bred up ever &s;ince, with this old Lady, in all the vanity, and unlimitted indulgence, that fondne&s;s and admiration could be&s;tow on a &s;poiled Child, a fancied Beauty! and a pretended Wit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! you are too &s;evere on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think &s;o, Sidney; for &s;he &s;eems a being expre&s;sly fa&s;hioned by nature, to figure in the&s;e days of levity and di&s;&s;ipation! her &s;pirits are inex|hau&s;tible! her parts &s;trong and lively! with a &s;agacity that di&s;cerns, and a talent not unhappy in painting the weak &s;ide of whatever comes before her.&mdash;But what rai&s;es her merit to the highe&s;t pitch, in the laughing world is, her boundle&s;s vanity, in the exertion of tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="9">
talents, which often renders her&s;elf much more ridi|culous, than the mo&s;t whim&s;ical of the characters &s;he expo&s;es.&mdash;And is this a woman fit to make my happi|ne&s;s? This the partner that Sidney would recommend to me for life? To you, who be&s;t know me, I ap|peal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Charles, it is a delicate point&mdash;unfit for me to determine&mdash;be&s;ides your Father has &s;et his mind upon the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Impatiently.</HI>)</STAGE>
All that I know&mdash;but &s;till I a&s;k, and in&s;i&s;t upon your candid judgment, is &s;he the kind of Woman that you think cou'd po&s;&s;ibly contribute to my happine&s;s?&mdash;I beg you will give me an explicit an&s;wer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ubject is di&s;agreeable&mdash;But &s;ince I mu&s;t &s;peak&mdash;I do not think &s;he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you do not; and I am &s;ure you ne|ver will advi&s;e the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never did&mdash;I never will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>With a &s;tart of joy.</HI>)</STAGE>
You make me happy&mdash;which, I a&s;&s;ure you, I never could be with your judg|ment again&s;t me on this point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Charles, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that Lady Rodolpha, with all her ridiculous laughing vanity, has a goodne&s;s of heart, and a kind of viva|city, that not only entertains, but upon &s;eeing her two or three times, improves upon you, and when her tor|rent of &s;pirits abates, and &s;he conde&s;cends to conver&s;e gravely, you will really like her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, aye, &s;he is &s;prightly, good-humoured, and tho' whim&s;ical, and often too high in her colouring of characters, and in the trifling bu&s;ine&s;s of the idle world, yet, I think &s;he has principles and a good heart; but in a partner for life, Sidney, (you know your own precept&mdash;your own judgment) affection, capricious in its nature, mu&s;t have &s;omething even in the external manners&mdash;nay, in the very mode, not only of beauty, but virtue it&s;elf, which both heart and judgment mu&s;t approve, or our happine&s;s in that delicate point cannot be la&s;ting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that mode that amiable e&s;&s;ential, I never can meet with but in Con&s;tantia.&mdash;You &s;igh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I only wi&s;h that Con&s;tantia had a fortune equal to yours; but pray, Charles, &s;uppo&s;e I had been &s;o indi&s;creet as to have agreed to marry you to Con|&s;tantia, would &s;he have con&s;ented, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively; but I &s;up|po&s;e &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you never &s;peak to her, upon that &s;ubject then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>In general terms only; never directly a&s;ked her con&s;ent in form; but I will this very moment, for I have no a&s;ylum from my Father's arbitrary de&s;ign, but my Con&s;tantia's arms&mdash;Pray do not &s;tir from hence&mdash;I will return in&s;tantly; I know &s;he will &s;ubmit to your advice, and I am &s;ure you will per&s;uade her to my wi&s;h, as my life, my peace, my earthly happine&s;s depend upon my Con&s;tantia.

<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Charles! He little dreams that I love Con&s;tantia&mdash;but to what degree I knew not my&s;elf, till he importuned me to join their hands.&mdash;Yes, I love, but mu&s;t not be a rival&mdash;for he is dear to me as fraternal friend&s;hip&mdash;my benefactor, my friend, and that name is &s;acred It is our better &s;elf, and ought to be preferred.&mdash;For the man who gratifies his pa&s;|&s;ions at the expence of his friend's happine&s;s, wants but a head to contrive, for he has a heart capable of the blacke&s;t vice.</P>

<L>Not wealth, but morals, make the happy life.</L></Q>
