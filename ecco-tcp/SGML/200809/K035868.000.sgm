<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY Sir, are you the Author of the <HI>Ob|&s;ervator?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;er.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;e it Sir, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay don't be angry, are you the reputed Author? <HI>A.</HI> Come off <HI>you Taught me in one of your Papers about</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I wanted a little Civil Di&s;cour&s;e with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be Civil, as you &s;ay, you are Welcome, but you begin but odly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Que&s;tions may be blunt, but you are not bound to An&s;wer them, but let that be as you like 'em.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Pray who do you reckon is the Author of this Devili&s;h Book, call'd, <HI>The Shorte&s;t Way?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall An&s;wer mo&s;t of your Que&s;tions with a Que&s;tion, I believe, and begin with you here.</P>
<P>Do you think my Name is Mr. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> that you take me for <HI>an Informer?</HI> read the <HI>Gazett,</HI> there you have the Man with the <HI>Sharp Chin,</HI> and a <HI>Dutch No&s;e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but Sir, we begin to doubt that is not the true Author, that he has been only made the Tool of &s;ome other party, who now they find the World Exa&s;pera|ted at it, have &s;lipt out of the Noo&s;e, and left him in it; we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality, and there is &s;uch a de&s;ign on foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your An&s;wer, like Par&s;on <HI>Jacobs</HI> Text, ought to be taken a pieces and Explain'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you are not &s;ure he is the Author, you <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI> have done him a great deal of wrong, for you have rail'd at him more than all the re&s;t of the World, and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well po&s;&s;ible for one Man to be Guilty of.</P>
<P N="2">2. And yet by &s;uppo&s;ing him not to be the Author, you &s;uppo&s;e him to be very Hone&s;t to his friends, that he bears all this without di&s;covering them.</P>
<P N="3">3 As for your fears of a real de&s;ign, to put the <HI>Shorte&s;t way</HI> in practice upon you, no Que&s;tion there are abundance of People in the World, who would be glad there was not one of you left; I believe no body doubts it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who do you think they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir your Humble Servant; no <HI>Bellamy, I</HI> tell you not <HI>I</HI> Sir; If I were in a Plot with the Devil, I'le never turn Evidence, be&s;ides Sir, <HI>I</HI> have no mind to have my No&s;e and Chin de&s;crib'd, but if you plea&s;e I'le An&s;wer you Negatively, who I believe are not concern'd in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be &s;ome &s;atisfaction, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the Queen, Sir, not the Parliament, not the Council, not the Army, not the Mini&s;ters of State, not the Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a &s;afe Man, thoul't never go to <HI>Newgate</HI> for Negatives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir, nor for Po&s;itives neither, if I can help it; but you have had your will at Catechi&s;ing, and I ought to have my turn, let me ask you a few Que&s;tions too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray why are you <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Angry at the Book call'd <HI>The Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> 'Tis a little My&s;terious, Sir, that the <HI>Church Men</HI> are Affronted becau&s;e t'was Writ again&s;t them, and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are Affronted becau&s;e tis Wrote again&s;t them too, I don't well under&s;tand it, 'ne &s;ort mu&s;t be Fools, that's certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care whether I under&s;tand it or no, he is a <HI>Rogue,</HI> a <HI>Villain,</HI> and I wi&s;h the Government had him, if I knew where he was, I'd deliver him up <HI>and abate them the</HI> 50 l.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spoken like a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> truly, &s;o that I find you are Angry at him becau&s;e you don't under&s;tand him, and the Government becau&s;e they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are &s;o &s;harp upon me, I do under&s;tand a a little too, I under&s;tand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with, and he is the Man they &s;ay who has been the occa&s;ion of all this Per&s;ecution which is com|ing upon us, by railing at <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he expos'd you for <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> 'tis what you ought to have rectifi'd your &s;elves, that you need not have been expos'd for it; and in that he was your Friend; for had you took the hint and exploded the Practice, there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what had he to do with that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, What had Mr. <HI>How</HI> to do to meddle with it afterward, I'll a&s;&s;ure you his Name is down in my Pocket Book, and when any Man in <HI>England</HI> defends a cau&s;e wor&s;e, I'll put his Name out, and put t'others Name in: But pray Sir, why do you call this bring|ilng Per&s;ecution upon you; do you &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Occa&s;io|nal</HI> Bill will be a Per&s;ecution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ort of Per&s;ecution can you call it? it can't be a Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pray Sir, &s;uppo&s;e one of your Brethren <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who can go to the <HI>Meeting</HI> to Day, and to the <HI>Church</HI> to Morrow; take the <HI>Sacrament</HI> to Day, &s;it|ting, and to Morrow to get a good place, go to <HI>Church,</HI> and take it kneeling, wipe his Mouth and go home to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Dinner, and &s;o to the <HI>Meeting</HI> again; &s;uppo&s;e this Gen|leman &s;hould be put up for <HI>Sherriff,</HI> or <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> can this Man pretend Con&s;cience not to Conform? I tell you Sir, Mr. <HI>How</HI> mu&s;t make a better An&s;wer to the matter before I can be convinc'd, you may call it Per|&s;ecution but it can never be for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Per&s;ecution is Per&s;ecution, let it be for what &s;ake it will, every man ought to be at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that is true, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> am for Liberty for every man to &s;erve God as is mo&s;t agreeable to his Con&s;cience: But this is not &s;erving God at all: be&s;ides Sir, I could ea&s;ily make it appear, this Act is for your advantage, if ye were a &s;ort of People were to be convinc'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, how Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, it will purge you of all your half in half Profe&s;&s;ors. That's one thing; then it will put all tho&s;e Gentlemen into a capacity of being in pla|ces and Parliaments, who tho' by this Act they are &s;epa|rated from you, and rejoin'd to the Church becau&s;e they can conform, will &s;till be friends to your Intere&s;t in all Publick Concerns; and therefore had I been to word the Bill &s;o as to have done mo&s;t harm, it &s;hou'd have excluded all that ever were Di&s;&s;enters, and have forc'd you to continue &s;o, and not have accepted your return to the Church without a publick Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you may per&s;wade us 'tis for our ad|vantage, but we don't like it, and therefore we hate him for medling with it; for what had he to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;</SPEAKER>
<P>About as much as you and I have to do with him, if a man meddles with what does not concern him, that's his Fault, and if we who really have nothing to do with him, meddle with him, that is our Fault, let the Govern|ment alone with him, have you nothing el&s;e to talk on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why all the Town has talkt of him as wellas we.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and reckon'd up all his Faults, all the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;ins that ever he committed in his Life, and abundance more; be the man who he will, and what he will, I don't &s;ee but the be&s;t of us would be loth all the Faults we have &s;hould be reckon'd up and writ in our Fore-heads, as his are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he has been a mo&s;t wicked Wretch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>You force a man to be an Advocate for One he has no kindne&s;s for; a wicked wretch you &s;ay; why what has he been a Thief, a Murderer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No no, <HI>I</HI> don't mean that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has he been a Clipper or Coyner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No no, nor that neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he been a Whorema&s;ter or a Drunkard, or a Swearer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay &s;o neither, but he broke and can't pay his Debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had &s;aid he had broke and won't pay his Debts, you had &s;aid more to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t do one piece of Ju&s;tice to the man, though <HI>I</HI> love him no better than you do, that is this: That meeting a Gentleman in a <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> where I and every body el&s;e was railing at him, the Gentlemen took us up with this &s;hort Speech.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid he, I know this D <HI>Foe</HI> as well as any of you, and <HI>I</HI> was one of his Creditors, and <HI>I</HI> compounded with him, and di&s;charg'd him fully; and &s;everal years afterward he &s;ent for me, and tho' he was clearly di&s;charg'd, he paid me all the Remainder of his Debt voluntarily, and of his own accord: and he told me, that as fa&s;t as God &s;hould enable him he Intended to do &s;o with every body; when he had done, he de&s;ir'd me to &s;et my hand to a Paper to acknowledg it, which <HI>I</HI> readily did, and found a great many Names to the Paper, before me, and <HI>I</HI> think my &s;elf bound to own it, tho' <HI>I</HI> am no Friend to the Book he has wrote,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
no more than you. What do you think of this &s;tory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think of it, I do'nt believe it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> can't help that, nor <HI>I</HI> care not whether you do or no, but I a&s;&s;ure you after <HI>I</HI> heard it, I never rail'd at him any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I'll rail at him for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>You Di&s;&s;enters are in &s;omething like Ca&s;e with the <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> when the Que&s;tion was put to them by our Saviour about <HI>Johns</HI> Bapti&s;m; whether it was from Heaven or of Men. If a man &s;hould ask you of the <HI>Shorte&s;t way,</HI> was it wrote for you or again&s;t you? If you &s;hould &s;ay for us, you would be askt why then are you &s;o mad with the Author? And if you &s;hould &s;ay again&s;t you, the People would laugh at you; for all men but you &s;ee into it, and that a Di&s;&s;enter wrote it; you mu&s;t &s;ay therefore, we cannot tell, and con&s;equently, that you rail at the Author for you can't tell what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we don't count him a Di&s;&s;enter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has all the marks of a Di&s;&s;enter upon him, but <HI>mant of Brains.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are we &s;o empty of Brains pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's rea&s;on for it, God has given you <HI>Equiva|lents.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't under&s;tand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a further Te&s;timony of your being a Di&s;&s;enter; why if you will have it, take it, I &s;ay, <HI>God Almighty would have &s;eem'd unkind to you, if he had not given you a great deal of Grace? For he has given you but little Wit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>I hope they'l take him &s;till,</HI> I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him hang'd for it, I am &s;ure he de&s;erves it; I heard one met him a little while ago, wou'd <HI>I</HI> had been there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alone, do you mean Sir, or to have helpt the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any how, &s;o I could but have taken him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas in <HI>Hackney Fields,</HI> was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>I</HI> think &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and they &s;ay 'twas one of your own Party too, and one that wou'd fain have got the 50 <HI>l.</HI> but that he drew upon him frighted him out of his Wits, and made him down of his Knees and &s;wear that if ever he met him again, he &s;hould &s;hut his eyes till he was half a mile off him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> don't think he's &s;uch a fighting Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought by your Charity and good Nature; I know him not neither, but the man has the Govern|ment upon his Back already, and if they take him they'l avenge your Quarrel for you. Let him alone, 'tis In|generous, as I &s;aid before in print, to triumph over a man in his Affliction: 'twas but a little while ago he wrote a Book that pleas'd you, and then you cry'd him up as much as now you cry him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Book pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the New Te&s;t of Church of <HI>England</HI> Loy|alty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he write that Book?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> told you I was no Informer, go ask Mr. <HI>Bellamy;</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>why truly that was a good thing, I lik't it fully. 'Twas well done, but this cur&s;ed <HI>Shorte&s;t-way</HI> is the Devil, he mu&s;t be turn'd Rogue now, what ever he was then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this 'tis to oblige a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> if you &s;erve them a hundred times 'tis well, but once get your Head in the Pillory for them, and they'l be the fir&s;t to palt you with rotten Eggs; what can't you &s;et down one good thing and one bad, and ballance with him: You under|&s;tand
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Accompts well enough; but you <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> are like a Shop keeper I knew, who having traded 20 Year with a Gentleman, and &s;erv'd all his Family and gotten a great deal of money by him, at la&s;t the poor Gentle|man fell to decay, and owing him 40 <HI>s.</HI> the Shop-keep|er abus'd him, and call'd him all the Knaves and Rogues for cheating of him of 40 s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, this has &s;poylt all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but wee'l go back further with you, There's the <HI>Reformation of Manners,</HI> and the <HI>True born-Engli&s;h-man;</HI> there he pleas'd you for certain, for he is for reforming your Magi&s;trates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> don't under&s;tand them, <HI>I</HI> am for Reformation as much as any Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what &s;ay you to the Legion Paper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that was a good thing indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if he had been taken in doing that, wou'd you not have call'd him as many Rogues then as you do now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, &s;hou'd I not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I don't find you call him one Rogue the le&s;s for it now, and that's hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, But you &s;ee he denyes it, and chal|lenges you to prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, deny it, I told you he was no Fool, indeed I am not glad I printed it, for tho' it is charged upon him by common Fame, I am not for hanging men upon &s;uppo&s;itions as you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you do well, and I think 'tis a little hard, <HI>the man is gone,</HI> and tho' he has done ill, he might mean no harm, and &s;o let him alone, <HI>I reck|on you won't be long before you follow him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when I am gone, you'l call me as many Rogues as you do him, won't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it may be <HI>I</HI> &s;han't, but I can tell you of &s;ome that do already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all one to me, common Fame like a com|mon Strumpet, jilts every Body, but methinks Slan|der and Reproach, out of the mouth of a Di&s;&s;en|ter comes with &s;ome more than common ill favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>They think they have good rea&s;on for it upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think not, pray what are their good rea&s;ons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>For abu&s;ing your Friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Friends, prithee who are they? I know but very few <HI>I</HI> have, and I am very &s;ure <HI>I</HI> never abus'd them</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>They all agree you would not be permit|ted to write &s;o long, but the party would have ruffled you before now, only you court them and plea&s;e them by a Side-Wind, with your railing at King <HI>William</HI>'s Friends &s;ometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>King <HI>William</HI>'s Enemies you mean; look, Sir, I have as much veneration for the Memory of King <HI>William</HI> as any of you, and do but once prove them to be King <HI>William</HI>'s Friends, and I'll own all you &s;ay, and recant all I have wrote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's ea&s;y to prove they were his Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir, don't you tax me with abu&s;ing King <HI>VVilliam,</HI> and abu&s;e him your &s;elf, <HI>I</HI> have prov'd &s;ufficiently they were the Nations Enemies: Now if you can prove the Nations Enemies were King <HI>VVilliam</HI>'s Friends, you'l make a fine &s;pot of work on't indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Twould have convinc'd us very plainly of two very &s;ignificant Things. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That there is &s;uch a De&s;ign, and then that the Authors of it re|ceiv'd no Countenance from Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Manners and Common Ju&s;tice ought to have convinc'd you of the la&s;t, and your Author of <HI>the Shorte&s;t way,</HI> to his Co&s;t, open'd your Eyes in the fir&s;t, if you had not wilfully &s;hut them again&s;t the Light.</P>
<P N="1">1. Good Manners would inform you, not to doubt the Word of your Prince, 'till you had &s;ome rea&s;on from her MAJESTY her &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. Common Ju&s;tice commands us to &s;uppo&s;e every Per&s;on ju&s;t and hone&s;t, till &s;omething appears to the contrary; and it is a very unchri&s;tian, un|charitable way of treating the QUEEN, That becau&s;e &s;ome of the high Church-men have had the Indi&s;cretion, without her Authority, to &s;wagger you out of your Sen&s;es; therefore you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e her Promi&s;e broken, and her Word of no value.</P>
<P>The Author of <HI>the Shortest way</HI> comes with a Lanthorn for you, and he &s;umms up all the black Things this high Party had publi&s;h'd, into one Gene|ral, and if you had any Eyes, you might learn two Things from him, <HI>where he is like topay dear enough for teaching you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From the general abhorrence Mankind &s;hew'd of the Book, you might learn that the de|&s;truction of your Party is a Cruelty not to be found in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> from the Out-cry made again&s;t it by that Party in particular, you might learn who they were that were toucht in the Book, and where the de&s;ign again&s;t them lay.</P>
<P>As to the Quarrel you Di&s;&s;enters have at the Book <HI>that's a my&s;tery no man can unriddle but your &s;elves.</HI> 'Tis like Mr. <HI>Mead</HI>'s Wheel within a Wheel, and a further Te&s;timony to the World that you are a mo&s;t unaccountable People who&s;e ways are pa&s;t finding out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you would go about to per&s;wade me the Book was writ of our &s;ide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sir, 'tis hard to know what &s;ide you are off, and</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sir I know you too well to go about to per&s;wade you to any thing, who&s;e peculiar Talent is to be unper&s;wadeable; but if you will plea&s;e to an&s;wer me a few Que&s;tions you may perhaps per&s;wade your &s;elf of &s;omething or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Que&s;tions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are the high Church-men angry with him, while at the &s;ame time they openly declare 'tis the only way to deal with you, and what they would feign be at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely you puzzle me a little there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are angry, becau&s;e they take the Book as the Author meant it, and you, becau&s;e you
<PB N="26" REF="25">
take it as he wrote it, they as he meant, <HI>viz. to expo&s;e them,</HI> and tho' they are heartily willing to do you a Kindne&s;s that way, and have &s;hewn their good will by their words, yet knowing they want|ed power to execute it, and being con&s;cious to them|&s;elves that the Government was not of their Opini|on; they are enrag'd to have all their de&s;igns, laid open in Minature, and an Abridgment commu|nicated to the World in <HI>true Billin&s;gate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be &s;ome truth in this, but pray why then is the Government &s;o angry with him? I believe I have puzzled you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, the Government may have Rea&s;ons to be angry that you nor I know not off, nor have nothing to do with: But what if I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e</P>
<P>That the Government not thinking any per&s;on could be &s;o Barbarous as to harbour &s;uch a villain|ous De&s;ign as the Book &s;ugge&s;ts; are di&s;pleas'd at it as an affront done to the <HI>Church of England</HI> to Father Principles of Cruelty and De&s;truction upon her Members, which they are not guilty off.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if I &s;uppo&s;e this to be a Rea&s;on, I believe you cannot &s;uppo&s;e a better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, <HI>I</HI> begin to have better Thoughts of the Government than I had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> begin to hope they won't per&s;ecute us now, and as for <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> what care I? I &s;hall never be Lord Mayor or Common Council man;
<PB N="27" REF="26">
If I am call'd to it, 'tis time enough to come off then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>God Almighty is wonderfully beholden to you, when he calls you from a middle State to a good place, you'l take it for granted He calls you from the Meeting to the Church, and you'l be &s;ure to come. But I tell you, you ought to be &s;o far from the fear of a Per&s;ecution, that if you have any re&s;pect to your Party, you ought to pray for a Per&s;ecution upon them or ye are all undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thou art mad, thou art for the <HI>Shorte&s;t way.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I an't for &s;uch Per&s;ecution neither, but I told you my mind before, I am &s;ure you have receiv'd more damage in your Intere&s;t as Di&s;&s;e n|ters, and more weakned your Reputation as well as your Number, Since the late Tolleration, than ever your Enemies did for you by all the penal Laws, Informers, Fines, and Pri&s;ons of the la&s;t Per&s;ecu|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but here's another danger upon us that we han't talkt of yet, and fear it will come upon us too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Di&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are affraid that this re&s;tle&s;s Party will overthrow our Settlement, for they do not &s;tick to talk that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>We affraid, who do you mean by we? Are not the <HI>Church of England</HI> as much concern'd in the Settlement as you and more too, as they are the major part of the Nation? and We (if you will
<PB N="28" REF="27">
give me leave to talk your way) We Prote&s;tants fear nothing for our Settlement, and for this, I'll give you a Quotation from the man with the hook No&s;e and &s;harp Chin, it may be you won't like it becau&s;e of the Author, but his words are the&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Settlement of the Crown (&s;ays he) is the Ba&s;is of our <HI>Religion, Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties.</HI> This is the &s;olid Bottom on which we all &s;tand, and of which, with re&s;pect to civil Right, may be &s;aid <HI>Other Foundation can no man lay than that which is Laid.</HI> 'Tis the Rock on which we are all built, and that &s;tone of which, according to the Scripture, it may without prophanene&s;s be &s;aid, <HI>Who&s;oever it falls upon, he will be broken to pieces, but on whom|&s;oever it &s;hall fall, it will grind him to Powder.</HI><P>"'Tis the la&s;t thing the People of <HI>England</HI> will part with after all their E&s;tates, Wives and Chil|dren, Churches and Hou&s;es are de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>"'Tis the Pledge of the Divine Goodne&s;s to the Nation, which they purcha&s;ed at the expence of 50 millions of Money, and the Blood of above 100000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men in Eleven years War.</P>
<P>"'Twas one of the great Things King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> did for us, and the Trea&s;ure GOD and his MAJESTY left in our Hands in tru&s;t for our Po&s;terity; which if we part with, our Children will cur&s;e our Memory and digg us out of our Graves.</P>
<P>"'Tis a Thing &s;o &s;acred the di&s;&s;olving of it can|not be mention'd without a Crime, nor &s;o much as intended without being guilty of Trea&s;on in the mo&s;t inten&s;e Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
"'Tis the &s;olid Prop upon which &s;tands her pre&s;ent MAJESTIES Throne, and the right and ju&s;t Title &s;he has to govern us.</P>
<P>"'Tis like the two Pillars in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Da|gon</HI> whoever pulls them down will, like <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> be buryed in the Ruines, and pull the whole Nation upon their Heads.</P>
<P>"<HI>I</HI> Fear nothing for this Settlement; the Parlia|ment of <HI>England</HI> are the Tru&s;tees for the &s;eeing it forth coming to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and a Parliament of <HI>England</HI> will never betray their tru&s;t.</P>

<P>Is this done by our <HI>Shorte&s;t way</HI> Man?</P>

<P>The very &s;ame.</P>

<P>Well, I &s;hall love him the better for it: But there's one thing more &s;till, what &s;ay you to the Prince of <HI>Wales?</HI> If ever he comes again you'l be hang'd, that's for certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if ever we let him come we ought all to be hang'd, I can do no better than refer you to the &s;ame Author.</P>

<P>Indeed I am of the Opinion your Fears both of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and of altering the Settle|ment, and of Per&s;ecution, are all groundle&s;s and e|qually &s;o.
