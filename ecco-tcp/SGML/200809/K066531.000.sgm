<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, CIVIL AND CANONICAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to the pre&s;ent practice of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, in ca&s;es of matrimo|nial infidelity, if the party accu&s;ed prove that the accu&s;er hath al&s;o committed adul|tery,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or even <HI>fornication,</HI> which our modern practice has confounded with <HI>adultery,</HI> contrary to the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the <HI>canons,</HI> and the &s;criptures, or <HI>divine law,</HI> on which the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> law is confe&s;&s;edly founded.</NOTE> &s;uch proof is held a compen&s;ation for the crime of the accu&s;ed, and the accu|&s;er fails of cour&s;e in the &s;uit. But, this is contrary to the practice of the civil and canon law in other prote&s;tant countries, and as it &s;tood immediately after the Reformation in England. A divorce for adultery was
<PB N="2" REF="5">
then granted <HI>a vinculo matrimonii,</HI> from the bonds of matrimony; and it was the opi|nion of the church of England, at the commencement of the reign of Queen Eli|zabeth, that, after a divorce for adultery, the parties might marry again. It is true that the de&s;potic tribunal, the <HI>&s;tar-chamber,</HI> who&s;e very name is odious to the ears of a free-born Engli&s;hman, did rever&s;e this opinion. That arbitrary and high-flown prelate, arch-bi&s;hop Bancroft, with the con|&s;ent of the clergy, got it there determined that adultery was only a cau&s;e of divorce, <HI>a men&s;a et thoro,</HI> from bed and board.</P>
<P>But, what was this le&s;s than acting again&s;t the &s;pirit, rever&s;ing the very principles, of the Reformation; and recurring back again to the u&s;ages and practices of popery? It is indeed remarkable that Engli&s;hmen talk &s;ome|times as ignorantly of their <HI>religious</HI> as of their <HI>civil</HI> liberty, in extravagantly boa&s;ting the effects of the Reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">Had indeed the <HI>reformatio legum,</HI> projected in the reign of Henry the Eighth, been car|ried into execution, by any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, a more compleat reform would have taken place in England; as it did in Holland, and other prote&s;tant countries. But as it is, the Reformation hath but imperfectly en|tered into the con&s;titution of the church of England, and the in&s;titutes of our eccle&s;i|a&s;tical law: there having been few, if any, &s;tatutes &s;ince made re&s;pecting popery, in which the &s;aving of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction is not e&s;pecially provided for. It is indeed ex|pre&s;&s;ly mentioned, in mo&s;t of them, that no|thing therein &s;hall take away, or abridge, the authority or juri&s;diction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures; but that the archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges, may proceed as before &s;uch laws were enacted. What is this but carefully raking up the embers, and mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly pre&s;erving the idolatrous relicts, of popery?</P>
<P>The above practice is plainly the effect of the advantage, which the prelate and prie&s;ts
<PB N="4" REF="7">
above-mentioned took, of the failure of the intended reformation of the church-laws, to e&s;tabli&s;h in the <HI>&s;tar-chamber</HI> a doctrine diame|trically oppo&s;ite to the opinion of the learned and pious fathers of the Reformation. Mar|tin Bucer, in the tract he addre&s;&s;ed to Edward the Sixth on this &s;ubject, employs a whole chapter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxii.</NOTE> to prove from the be&s;t authorities as well of the primitive fathers, as of the doctrines of the Chri&s;tian church, that a ma|nife&s;t adultre&s;s ought to be divorced, and cannot lawfully be retained in marriage by a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>If law, &s;ays that celebrated ca&s;ui&s;t, Milton,
<Q>aim at the firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and pre&s;ervation of matrimonal faith, we know that cannot thrive under violent means, but is the more violated. It is not when two, unfortunately met, are by the canon forced to draw in that yoke, an unmerciful day's work of &s;orrow, till death unharne&s;s 'em, that then the law keeps
<PB N="5" REF="8">
marriage mo&s;t unviolated and unbroken: but when the law takes order that marriage be accountant and re&s;pon&s;ible to perform that &s;ociety, whether it be religious, civil, or corporal, which may be con&s;cionably re|quired and claimed therein, or el&s;e to be di&s;&s;olved, if it cannot be undergone; this is to make marriage mo&s;t indi&s;&s;oluble, by ma|king it a ju&s;t and equal dealer, a performer of tho&s;e due helps which in&s;tituted the co|venant; it being otherwi&s;e a mo&s;t unju&s;t con|tract, and no more to be maintained under tuition of the law, than the <HI>vile&s;t fraud,</HI> or <HI>cheat,</HI> or <HI>theft</HI> that may be committed. The law can to no rational purpo&s;e for|bid divorce; it can only take care that the conditions of divorce be not injurious.</Q></P>
<P>For this, as a real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, he ap|peals to the learned Selden's tract on the law of nature and nations; a work, &s;ays he,
<Q>more u&s;eful and more worthy to be peru&s;ed by who&s;oever &s;tudies to be a great man in wi&s;dom, equity, and ju&s;tice, than all tho&s;e <HI>decretals and &s;umle&s;s &s;ums,</HI> which the
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<HI>pontifical clerks</HI> have doted on, ever &s;ince that unfortunate mother famou&s;ly &s;inned thrice, and died impenitent of her bringing into the world tho&s;e two mi&s;begotten in|fants, and forever infants, Lombard and Gra|tian; him the compiler of canon iniquity, t'other the Tubal Cain of &s;chola&s;tick &s;ophi&s;|try, who&s;e over-&s;preading barbari&s;m hath not only infu&s;ed their own ba&s;tardy upon the fruitfulle&s;t part of humane learning, but ob|&s;cured the clear light of nature and of na|tions, by their calumnious dunceries!</Q></P>
<P>Now, if the&s;e authorities, &s;trengthened by tho&s;e of the mo&s;t rigid divines and morali&s;ts among the fir&s;t reformers, &s;uch as Wickliff, Luther, Melancton, Era&s;mus, and a long train of divines, civilians and canoni&s;ts, down to Grotius him&s;elf; I &s;ay, if the&s;e autho|rities will ju&s;tify the &s;etting a&s;ide that of Ju&s;tinian and the popi&s;h decretals, in favour of Valentinian and Theodo&s;ius, &s;upported by almo&s;t all the primitive fathers; the mo|dern practice, of refu&s;ing a divorce in ca&s;es of adultery, mu&s;t be allowed to be a bar|barous
<PB N="7" REF="10">
and oppre&s;&s;ive in&s;tance of the remains of prie&s;tcraft and popery; the con&s;equence of an imperfect reformation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor do the ancient authorities abovementioned want later confirmation, as to their ju&s;tice and propriety. Even Black&s;tone him&s;elf, in admitting that, tho' the canon law (which the common law mo&s;t exceptionably follows only in this particular ca&s;e) deems &s;o highly and with &s;uch my&s;terious reverence of the nuptial tie, that it will not allow it to be unloo&s;ed for any cau&s;e whatever, which ari&s;es after the union is made; he yet plainly in&s;inuates that &s;uch doctrine does not appear to him well grounded. <Q>It is &s;aid,</Q> proceeds this learned writer, <Q>to be built on the divine revealed law, tho' that expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;igns inconti|nence, as a cau&s;e why a man <HI>may</HI> put away his wife and marry another.</Q> <HI>See Black&s;tone's commentaries on the laws of England,</HI> Book I. chap. xv.</NOTE></P>
<P>This argument may be carried &s;till far|ther, and the practice of admitting the plea of recrimination and of refu&s;ing a complete divorce <HI>a vinculo,</HI> even in ca&s;es of adul|tery, be proved totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit and practice of the common and &s;tatute law; by which the canon law &s;hould be con|trouled.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This indeed is the generally-received opinion; altho' it is whim&s;ically ob&s;ervable that there is a difference be|tween the opinions of our mo&s;t approved lawyers even on this point. Burn lays it down as a certain and univer&s;al rule, that the civil and canon law, in all ca&s;es, is &s;ubordinate to the common and &s;tatute law. This was the opinion al&s;o of Judge Hale and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Coke. Black|&s;tone, on the other hand, tells you that the common law follows the canon law in ca&s;es of divorce for adultery; tho' he him&s;elf allows el&s;ewhere, that it is beyond a doubt that the civil and canon laws, tho' admitted in &s;ome ca&s;es by cu&s;tom in &s;ome courts, are only &s;ubordinate and <HI>leges &s;ub graviori lege.</HI> When doctors thus differ, it is not to be wondered at that inferior practitioners are &s;o ready, on all occa&s;ions, to give that opprobrious and illi|beral toa&s;t, "the profitable <HI>uncertainty</HI> of the law!"</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">The <HI>&s;tar-chamber</HI> who&s;e deci&s;ions, as I have ob&s;erved, our eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts now follow in this particular, determined indeed that a man, divorced from his wife for in|continency on her part, &s;hould not marry again; &s;etting a&s;ide, in the famous ca&s;e of Foliambe, the &s;econd marriage of a man &s;o circum&s;tanced; which it declared void. But how does this practice agree with the com|mon and &s;tatute law? By the &s;tatute 1 J. c. 11. Any per&s;on guilty of polygamy, or marrying a &s;econd wife while the fir&s;t be living, is deemed guilty of felony. In the &s;ame act, however, it is provided, among other provi&s;os, that it &s;hall not extend to any per&s;on,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
who &s;hall be at the time of &s;uch marriage divorced by any &s;entence in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. Now the commentators, on this pro|vi&s;o, all agree that the divorce therein inti|mated, cannot mean the divorce <HI>a vinculo ma|trimonii</HI>; for then, without the aid of any provi&s;o, either party may freely marry; but it mu&s;t be intended of divorces merely <HI>a men|&s;a et thoro.</HI></P>
<P>It is hence plain that the &s;tatute law, by excepting per&s;ons marrying under &s;uch a pre|dicament from the penalty inflicted on po|lygamy, tacitly admits of &s;uch marriages; which is plainly incompatible with the &s;tar|chamber deci&s;ion above mentioned. To this may be added, that in mo&s;t ca&s;es the com|mon and &s;tatute laws of England con&s;ider marriage, as Black&s;tone has it, only as a civil contract or union.</P>
<P>Indeed the facility, with which acts of parli|ament are obtained for divorces on the cen|&s;ures of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, is a plain
<PB N="10" REF="13">
proof of the &s;en&s;e of the legi&s;lature re&s;pecting their propriety; although it mu&s;t be owned that the formality of obtaining &s;uch acts of parliament on the&s;e occa&s;ions. is a re&s;traint upon the &s;ubject; which gives countenance to the difficulties, the canoni&s;ts throw in the way of per&s;ons &s;uing out a divorce in the &s;piritual court. The&s;e acts of parlia|ment indeed put one in mind of the papal di&s;pen&s;ations, that were granted with like facility, as &s;alvos for the rigorous canons of the council of Trent, which prohibited di|vorce on any occa&s;ion whatever.</P>
<P>It is &s;en&s;ibly enough ob&s;erved, by an anoymous writer, who &s;eems neverthele&s;s but little acquainted with the practice of the canon law in England, that, <Q>according to the &s;pirit of the <HI>canon law</HI> (by &s;ome called a di&s;graceful ve&s;tige of monki&s;h barba|ri&s;m and popi&s;h tyranny) marriage is &s;till held &s;o religiou&s;ly &s;acramental as to be indi&s;&s;oluble, even for incontinence. The wedded pair mu&s;t &s;till, as Milton &s;ays, &s;pite of antipathy, fadge together.</Q> But
<PB N="11" REF="14">
"this, to the &s;candal of our laws," continues the writer <Q>is not the ca&s;e in any other prote&s;tant country. And yet, as if we were going to turn Romani&s;ts, and devolve again into a &s;tate of ignorance and bar|barity, we have lately &s;een the papal de|ci&s;ions, re&s;pecting the marriage of adul|terers, and the <HI>impedimentum criminis</HI> of the &s;chools, receive the &s;anction of a Briti&s;h act of parliament. But, for heaven's &s;ake, why not give a political toleration to a per&s;onal attachment, when the ties are di&s;&s;olved which rendered it criminal! It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch an interdic|tion will operate to the prevention of adultery; or that a &s;olicitude about fu|ture rights of marriage will affect their pre|&s;ent violation.</Q></P>
<P>An Engli&s;hman and a prote&s;tant mu&s;t be far from wi&s;hing to &s;ee any more exam|ples of this kind. So far indeed mu&s;t a con|&s;cientious man, tenacious of civil and reli|gious liberty, be from applauding the&s;e par|liamentary conce&s;&s;ions in favour of popery,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
that he could rather wi&s;h to &s;ee a legi&s;lative revi&s;ion of them, and a fair inve&s;tigation of the point; whether the legal abolition by &s;tatute of that arbitrary tribunal, the <HI>&s;tar|chamber,</HI> did not virtually annul both the precedents and practice of that court, as well re&s;pecting eccle&s;ia&s;tical as civil matters: in which ca&s;e the matter of divorce would &s;tand as it did ju&s;t after the Reformation, and agree|able to the opinion of the church of Eng|land, in the beginning of the reign of Eliza|beth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Burn indeed congratulates his contempora|ries, and &s;ays, it is the glory of the pre&s;ent age that the conte&s;ts between the courts of the common and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, regarding their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions have &s;ub&s;ided. "Per&s;ecution," &s;ays he, <Q>hath de|parted to its native hell; and fair benevolence hath come down from heaven. The di&s;tinctions, which were introduced during the plenitude of papal power, have fallen away by degrees; and we &s;hall naturally recur to the &s;tate wherein popery took us up: in which there was no thwarting between the two ju|ri&s;dictions, but they were amicably conjoined, afford|ing mutual help and ornament to each other.</Q></P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s this is a con&s;ummation devoutly to be wi&s;hed: but before it is compleated, I conceive it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome e&s;&s;ential alteration, or more properly &s;peaking, <HI>reformation,</HI> in the practice of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, re&s;pecting divorce.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">But to confine my&s;elf to the ca&s;e of matri|mony, I &s;hall enter into an inve&s;tigation of the nature of the crime commonly called adultery, and inquire how far the modern practice of our &s;piritual courts, in granting or refu&s;ing divorces under pretence of that crime, is conformable to the canons of the Chri&s;tian church and the laws of England.</P>
<P>There is hardly a word in our language of more vague and indeterminate import, than that of <HI>adultery.</HI> Our mo&s;t accurate lexi|cographers have but ill explained it, as a word; nor have our lawyers defined it, as a technical term, with better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Adultery, &s;ays the late learned editor of Bailey, "is properly the &s;in of incontinency in married per&s;ons defiling the marriage|bed; it is <HI>adultery,</HI> if but one of them be married, in the <HI>married</HI> per&s;on, <HI>fornication</HI> in the <HI>unmarried.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>See Bailey's dictionary folio (edited by Dr. Scott) under the word <HI>adultery</HI>; al&s;o <HI>fornication,</HI> under which latter head, we have the following remark. <Q><HI>Query,</HI> whether fornication in the &s;cripture u&s;e of the word is not di&s;tinct from concubinage; and, if &s;o, whether our modern acceptation of the word gives a ju&s;t idea of it? And by the way, if adultery, in the &s;crip|ture u&s;e, means only the cohabitation with another's wife, <HI>query</HI> if the modern u&s;e of this word al&s;o &s;hould not be recon&s;idered?</Q></P>
<P>Now, that the <HI>&s;cripture u&s;e</HI> of the&s;e words &s;hould de|termine their &s;en&s;e, in the <HI>&s;piritual court,</HI> is evident; becau&s;e the deci&s;ions of that court are determined by the canons of the church, confe&s;&s;edly founded on the divine law, as it is laid down in the Scriptures; according to the Decrees. <HI>Divinum jus in &s;cripturis divinis habemus.</HI> Di&s;tinct 8.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">Adultery, &s;ays Chambers, <HI>adulterium</HI> (in ancient law-books called advowtry) "is a crime committed by married per&s;ons again&s;t the faith pledged to each other in marriage, by having carnal commerce with &s;ome other; or even by a per&s;on not married by having to do with another that is."</P>
<P>It is very plain that the&s;e lexicographers, by making u&s;e of the word <HI>per&s;on</HI> and <HI>one</HI> in the epicene gender, have given but a very imperfect definition of the term. The fir&s;t &s;ays that, <Q>if one of the parties concerned be
<PB N="15" REF="18">
married and the other not, it is adultery in the married per&s;on, and fornication only in the per&s;on unmarried.</Q> But this differs with the &s;ex of the party; for, though an <HI>unmarried woman,</HI> lie with whom &s;he will, be not an adultre&s;s, yet an <HI>unmarried man,</HI> lying with a <HI>married woman,</HI> is univer&s;ally allowed to be an adulterer.</P>
<P>Again, the latter &s;ays, <Q>an unmarried per&s;on, having carnal commerce with ano|ther that is married, is guilty of adultery.</Q> But this holds good only when the unmar|ried per&s;on is the <HI>male</HI>; for, to rever&s;e the above propo&s;ition, though an <HI>unmarried man</HI> lying with a <HI>married woman</HI> be allowedly an <HI>adulterer</HI>; an <HI>unmarried woman,</HI> lie with whom &s;he will, is never &s;tigmatized as an <HI>adultre&s;s.</HI> A <HI>married woman</HI> only can be an <HI>adultre&s;s.</HI> The commi&s;&s;ion of the crime of adultery ab&s;olutely requires, that the <HI>fe|male party</HI> &s;hould be <HI>a wife.</HI> And hence it is evident, that as a &s;ingle woman lying with a married man is no adultere&s;s, &s;o a married man lying with a &s;ingle woman is
<PB N="16" REF="19">
no adulterer. There is no <HI>wife</HI> criminally concerned in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Our lawyers, as I ob&s;erved, are as palpa|bly defective in their definitions as the lexico|graphers. Wood, in his Civil In&s;titute, gives us the following definition and illu&s;tration; for which he refers to the dige&s;t of Ju&s;ti|nian. <Q>Adultery <HI>(adulterium, qua&s;i ad al|terius thorum,</HI> or <HI>ad alteram ire</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He might have added that an adulterer is al&s;o called in latin <HI>Moechus,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign">, ex <GAP DESC="foreign">, quod &agrave; domo &s;ua aver&s;us ali&ograve; &s;e convertat.</NOTE>) is a car|nal knowledge of another man's wife. So that a wife only can be guilty of adultery; and a married man, that lies with a &s;ingle woman, is not guilty of that crime. His guilt is only <HI>&s;tuprum,</HI> becau&s;e in him there is no danger of a confu&s;ion in families; no ba&s;tardy to inherit or rob the legitimate children.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wood In&s;t. Book III. chap. x.</NOTE></P>
<P>What &s;trange inaccuracy! <Q>Adultery is the carnal knowlege of another man's wife,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
&s;o that a wife only can be guilty of adul|tery!</Q> How can a wife only, or how can &s;he even at all, have carnal knowledge of another man's wife? This blunder, however, the author obviates, by his &s;ub&s;equent explana|tion; &s;hewing that he meant to &s;ay, that <HI>no woman</HI> but a <HI>wife</HI> can be guilty of <HI>adultery</HI>; and that <HI>no man</HI> is guilty of it, who does <HI>not lie</HI> with <HI>another man's wife.</HI></P>
<P>From getting rid of this blunder, our learn|ed lawyer proceeds neverthele&s;s to fall into ano|ther. "By the divine law," &s;ays he, <Q>adultery is every violation of the conjugal rites and marriage-bed, committed either by the man or woman. LEV. 20.10. And &s;o it is by the canons, 32.4.

<P><PB N="18" REF="21">What do we find here, that &s;hews the divine or canon law to be different from the civil? It expre&s;&s;ly &s;peaks of the crime of lying with another man's wife. Why then is it &s;ugge&s;ted that any other violation of the con|jugal rites, is adultery?</P>
<P>It is certainly a breach of the conjugal rites and of the faith pledged in marriage, if the hu&s;band turn away his wife without ju&s;t cau&s;e; refu&s;ing to love, to cheri&s;h and to hold her, for better for wor&s;e, in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, as he promi&s;es. But this he may do, without violating the marriage-bed; with|out being guilty of adultery, or even for|nication. On the other hand, he may be guilty of fornication, without any violation of conjugal rites, or breach of his matrimo|nial vow; as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew.</P>
<P>But here it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that I &s;peak only of per&s;ons married to each other, according to the rites, and ceremonies, of the church of England; and not of per&s;ons of the Romi&s;h religion, or other per&s;ua&s;ions. At the &s;ame time we are to take with us, that
<PB N="19" REF="22">
the canons of the church, by which the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical courts are in the&s;e ca&s;es governed, are no farther binding in tho&s;e courts, nor can &s;uch canons lawfully influence their de|ci&s;ions farther, than they are &s;upported by the divine law, as it is laid down in the holy &s;criptures. It is here al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that though the courts-chri&s;tian are governed by the canons of the church, which are founded on &s;cripture, the &s;criptures do not, as the canoni&s;ts affect to believe,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus in the ca&s;e of divorce between the earl and counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, heard before the King's delegates in the 11th year of James I. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury began his arguments by &s;aying, "In as much as we firmly believe, that the &s;cripture doth directly, or by con|&s;equence, contain in it &s;ufficient matter to decide all con|trover&s;ies, e&s;pecially in things appertaining to the church, as that marriage among chri&s;tians can be no le&s;s accounted than a &s;acred thing, as being in&s;tituted by God him&s;elf in paradi&s;e, honoured by the pre&s;ence of our Saviour him|&s;elf, declared by St. Paul to be a &s;ign of the &s;piritual con|junctions between Chri&s;t and his church."</P>
<P>In reply to this, his grace's preamble, however, the king's an&s;wer declared the opinion to be puritanical and prepo&s;terous. "The orthodox propo&s;ition," &s;ays he, "is, that the &s;cripture doth directly, or by con&s;equence, contain in it &s;ufficient matter to decide all controver&s;ies in points of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>&s;alvation</HI>; of which &s;ort MARRIAGE <HI>cannot</HI> be accounted for one."</P></NOTE> contain &s;ufficient rules to decide all controver&s;ies relative to matters agitated in tho&s;e courts.</P>

church, as adopted at the Reformation by the laws and the church of England; not by the canons of the church of Rome; which the former can legally retain only &s;o far as tho&s;e ca|nons are con&s;i&s;tent with the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Taking things in this light, the whole practice of the &s;piritual courts, in refu&s;ing a divorce <HI>a vinculo,</HI> in ca&s;es of adultery, is ille|gal, antichri&s;tian and oppre&s;&s;ive, Nor is this any novel doctrine, calculated for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; Adultery was held a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for divorce <HI>a vinculo,</HI> in the times of Henry VIII. Edward VI. and in the begin|ning of the reign of Elizabeth. In the de|bates of the hou&s;e of lords, on the celebrated ca&s;e of Lord Ro&s;s, Bi&s;hop Cozens proved, beyond a doubt, on the be&s;t authorities of the &s;criptures, the primitive fathers and councils, that adultery works a di&s;&s;olution of marriage
<PB N="21" REF="24">
between chri&s;tians. His words are remark|able. "The fir&s;t in&s;titution of marriage that the parties may be <HI>one fle&s;h,</HI> is by adul|tery di&s;&s;olved; when the adultere&s;s makes her&s;elf <HI>one fle&s;h</HI> with another man, and thereby di&s;&s;olves the fir&s;t bond of her mar|riage."</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e the learned bi&s;hop quotes, among other re&s;pectable authorities, the argument of Ame&s;ius: which concludes thus. "By adultery the very e&s;&s;ence of the contract is directly violated; now the contract cea&s;ing, the bond depending on the contract cea&s;es of cour&s;e. It is again&s;t all rea&s;on that the matrimonial duties &s;hould be for ever taken away, yet the bond or obliga|tion to tho&s;e duties &s;hould continue."</P>
<P>Serjeant Wright, in his pleadings before the commons in the duke of Norfolk's ca&s;e, ca&s;t a very bold and ju&s;t reflection on this practice of the &s;piritual court. "There is an exception to the general councils and ca|nons,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
in the refu&s;al of a divorce <HI>a vinculo,</HI> in ca&s;es of adultery; Mr. Speaker, I &s;ay it is an eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution which is contrary to the law of God."</P>
<P>By what law then, are our eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts in England governed? By the canons of the church? What church? the church of Rome, or the church of England? It can|not be the latter; for, to u&s;e the words of the learned bi&s;hop above mentioned, "I know not why they &s;hould be called the church of England, that join with the council of Trent, and plead &s;o much to uphold it rather than others, who join with all the reformed churches, and plead again&s;t that canon of the church of Rome; which hath laid an Anthema upon us, if we do not agree with them."</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble the reader therefore with in&s;ignificant authorities from the popi&s;h ca|nons. With prote&s;tants of the church of England, marriage <HI>is</HI> not <HI>a &s;acrament:</HI> it is
<PB N="23" REF="26">
merely <HI>a civil contract</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it is in other prote&s;tant countries. In Holland the ceremony of marriage is not celebrated merely by the prie&s;t, but by the magi&s;trate; as it was in England, during the inter-regnum, by the ju&s;tices of the peace; which marriages were confirmed by act of parliament on the re&s;toration.</NOTE> the terms of which are pre&s;cribed in the ritual; which is confirm|ed by act of parliament; and, though the meaning of the&s;e terms is to be explained in a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e; yet that &s;en&s;e is to be de|termined by the divine law, as laid down in the &s;criptures; and not by the canon laws, derived from popi&s;h councils or papal de|crees.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, however, to con&s;ider the terms of the matrimonial contract, as entered into by the members of the church of England, I &s;hall endeavour to elucidate a point, which &s;eems to have perplexed &s;ome of our able&s;t civilians, re&s;pecting the nature and puni&s;hment of adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">Having explained, what is meant by the crime of adultery; the author of Wood's in&s;ti|tute proceeds to enumerate the &s;everal puni&s;h|ments, that have been inflicted on &s;uch crimi|nals in different ages and countries.

<P><Q>But it is not made death, in the wife, by the novels of Ju&s;tinian.

<P>On the apparent incompatibility of mild|ne&s;s and &s;everity contained in this law,
<PB N="25" REF="28">
our modern in&s;titutor has the following remark:</P>
<Q>The rea&s;on of this I cannot under&s;tand. It is &s;aid that Theodora, the wife of Ju&s;ti|nian, was the contriver of it. Some pre|tend that allowances ought to be made for the weakne&s;s of the &s;ex.</Q>
<P>But, granting this effect of female influence on the auther of the Novels; fickle as he was in the light of a lawgiver, he could never be &s;o favourable to the fair &s;ex and cruel to his own, as to puni&s;h incontinence in the one with death, and to excu&s;e the other with only the lo&s;s of dower and a &s;courging; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that the civil con|&s;equences of the one and the other are &s;o very di&s;proportionate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;pecially too as the affair of &s;courging was what the wife mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been u&s;ed to; unle&s;s her hu&s;band, neglecting Solomon's advice, by &s;paring the rod, had &s;poiled the child; for the civil law gave the hu&s;band a very whole&s;ome authority over his wife; allowing him for &s;ome mi&s;demeanours <HI>flagellibus et fu&s;tibus acriter verberare uxorem,</HI> that is, according to &s;ome tran&s;lators, "to <HI>cane</HI> or <HI>lace her &s;ides</HI> very hand|&s;omly:" an unpoli&s;hed cu&s;tom, it is true; prevailing at pre&s;ent, I think, only in Ru&s;&s;ia, under the govern|ment of an Empre&s;s remarkable for her matrimonial obe|dience.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">But, though Wood could not comprehend the rea&s;on why the hu&s;band was puni&s;hed with death, when the wife e&s;caped with &s;courging, it is plain from this very circum|&s;tance, that by adultery in the hu&s;band was not meant mere fornication, or the &s;imple act of incontinency. It was the crime of lying with another man's wife; a crime much more heinous in a married man, who had a wife of his own to go to, than in a &s;ingle man, who had none; the crime of the mar|ried man being, what our lawyers call dou|ble adultery; and therefore, it is no wonder it was &s;everely and &s;ignally puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, we may learn, from the Code, that adultery, even in a hu&s;band, was not thus &s;everely puni&s;hed, unle&s;s it was committed knowingly and wilfully.</P>
<Q><PB N="27" REF="30">If one lies with another's wife, not knowing her to be married, as in the pub|lick &s;tews, this puni&s;hment ought not to be inflicted; for, though a man, who attempts an unlawful thing, &s;hall be liable to the con&s;equences of it, yet tho&s;e <HI>con|&s;equences</HI> ought to be of the &s;ame nature with the fir&s;t de&s;ign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreeably, as he might have ob&s;erved, to the an|cient maxim, <HI>actus non facit reum, ni&s;i mens &s;it rea.</HI></NOTE> As when one intends to kill <HI>Titius,</HI> and kills <HI>Marius</HI> by mi&s;take, he &s;hall die for it; becau&s;e he intended murther.

<P>It Is hence extremely clear, that the car|nal commerce of a married man with a wo|man, whom he does not know, or has not rea&s;on to believe, is married; is not adul|tery in the man; whether the woman be married or &s;ingle: while, on the contrary, a married woman is guilty of adultery, by carnal commerce with any man but her hu&s;|band; becau&s;e &s;he cannot be incon&s;cious of her own marriage, and therefore mu&s;t know that &s;he is both principal and accomplice, in the lying with another man's wife; which is <HI>of the very e&s;&s;ence,</HI> as the &s;choolmen &s;ay, of adultery.</P>

<P>This doctrine, of the indi&s;&s;olubility of marriage, was a mo&s;t excellent expedient for the church of Rome.

<P>There are indeed &s;ome in&s;tances on record in which the parliament has taken up &s;uch ca&s;es originally; as in that of the duke of Norfolk before mentioned.

It is true the coun&s;el, in behalf of the dutche&s;s, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;i&s;ting of two able barri&s;ters, Sir Thomas Powys and Mr. Dodd, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that celebrated civilian Dr. Pinfold.</NOTE> laboured extremely hard, to convince the lower hou&s;e of the propriety of referring the cau&s;e to the eccle&s;ia|&s;tical courts. But their pleas were only tho&s;e of precedent; tending only to prove that tho&s;e courts had on all occa&s;ions delayed, protract|ed, and as much as in them lay, prevented the obtaining of divorces both in and out of par|liament.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">The arguments of Sir Thomas Powys and Dr. Pinfold in particular, evidently betrayed that the craft was thought to be in danger.

"What is it," &s;aid Sir Thomas, <Q>that guards you from an infinite application of this nature but requiring per|&s;ons to take the ordinary cour&s;e fir&s;t, and to come round about to the parliament, as the la&s;t remedy, to carry the &s;entence per|haps farther than the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court can do; but if per&s;ons can come up directly hither, I am apt to think your lobby will be crowded with petitioners of this nature the next &s;e&s;&s;ions: though the &s;e&s;&s;ions now are long and frequent, this &s;ingle bu&s;ine&s;s may be &s;o great as to ob&s;truct all other bu|&s;ine&s;s; I am &s;ure a committee for adultery would have full employment.&mdash;I know nothing can be &s;aid on the other &s;ide with good rea&s;on (unle&s;s that which I heard in another place) why they &s;hould not go to
<PB N="36" REF="39">
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, which is that tho&s;e courts cannot divorce <HI>a vinculo matrimonii</HI> therefore it would have been a vain thing; this may be a good rea&s;on for them to come to you afterwards, but 'tis no rea&s;on for them to come here at fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In confirmation of this argument, Dr. Pin|fold confirmed the a&s;&s;ertion as to the practice, and endeavoured to ju&s;tify it, as being agree|able to our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, ground|ed on the &s;en&s;e of the ancient canons.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">With all his abilities, however, he did it very lame|ly.

<P>To this plea Serjeant Wright very perti|nently replied. <Q>Mr. Speaker I am of coun|&s;el for the duke of Norfolk, who is your &s;uppliant for this bill, for redre&s;s again&s;t the highe&s;t injury that can be offered: the rights of his marriage-bed have been in|vaded, and he comes for that relief here,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
which no other court can afford him; for the learned doctor, on the other &s;ide, tells you plainly from the canon law, that there can be no divorce <HI>a vinculo matrimonii</HI> in their courts; now to &s;end us to a court for relief, that they tell us before hand can give us none, is in effect to tell us we &s;hall have none at all.</Q></P>
<P>The parliament &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the pro|priety of this reflection, and gave the duke relief without &s;ending him to the &s;piritual court. They acted in the &s;ame manner in the ca&s;e of the earl of Macclesfield, in who&s;e favour an act was pa&s;&s;ed, before &s;entence of di|vorce obtained in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court.</P>
<P>The&s;e, with &s;everal other ca&s;es of a &s;imi|lar nature, &s;ufficiently &s;hew that the practice of the courts-chri&s;tian; in re&s;pect to divorce, has long been repugnant to the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This will appear &s;till farther on a retro&s;pect to the ca&s;e of the Marquis of Northampton, in

the reign of Edward the Sixth. <Q>The marquis was married to a daughter of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and &s;he eloped from him, and was pro&s;ecuted in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and there was &s;entence again&s;t her of di|vorce; the marquis from thence took upon him to marry a daughter of the lord Cob|ham, and after four years marriage of her he obtained an act of parliament to rati&s;y the &s;econd marriage, which act recites a &s;ettlement of divorce in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court.</Q> But, though the act does recite the proceedings in the &s;piritual court, it is plain the marquis married again in open defi|ance of their canons. It is plain al&s;o that the legi&s;lature approved of &s;uch marriage as be|ing conformable to the laws of God, however incompatible with tho&s;e of the church.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is farther remarkable that on this occa&s;ion the hou&s;e of peers was &s;o unanimous, that there were but two tem|poral and two &s;piritual lords di&s;&s;entient, on pa&s;&s;ing the bill.</NOTE> The divorce al&s;o was not made any plea for pa&s;&s;ing the bill; &s;o that the act was expre&s;&s;ly granted,

<P>In the before mentioned ca&s;e, al&s;o, of Lord Ro&s;s, afterwards Earl of Rutland, we are told that, notwith&s;tanding he had obtained a di|vorce in the &s;piritual court, no mention is made of it in the act.</P>
<P>It is hence evident the legi&s;lature very ju&s;tly conceives that adultery does really di&s;|&s;olve the marriage, and therefore it permits the parties divorced to marry again; though it leaves them ab&s;urdly open to the mi&s;con|&s;tructions of the canons, and the mercile&s;s fangs of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;or.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, therefore, that it &s;hould &s;till continue to countenance &s;uch practice, e&s;pecially as it is evidently incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the common and &s;tatute law of the realm?</P>
<P>I have already hinted that the &s;tatute again&s;t polygamy excepts the party who is divorced,

though but from bed and board, by the &s;pi|ritual court: by which it is evident the le|gi&s;lature con&s;idered the &s;econd marriage of &s;uch party not only conformable to the law of God, but al&s;o conformable to the common law of England. Quod non prohibetur, per|mittitur.</P>
<P>The &s;ugge&s;tion therefore is not true, which is laid down by modern practitioners, viz. that <Q>by the canon law, <HI>which is approved and confirmed by the laws of this realm in this behalf,</HI> it is not lawful for per&s;ons who are divorced in the&s;e ca&s;es to betake them|&s;elves to a &s;econd marriage, whil&s;t their former hu&s;band or wife is alive; becau&s;e the matrimonial bond once perfected, can|not be di&s;&s;olved by man, but only by death.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Con&s;ett's tran&s;lation of Clarke.

<P>It is true that the &s;piritual court may take notice of &s;uch marriages and annul them; but nothing is more clear than that the ex|ceptive clau&s;e in the &s;tatute proves &s;uch prac|tice to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the common and &s;tatute law of the realm; by which the deci&s;ions of the canon law ought con|fe&s;&s;edly in England to be controuled; nay, are expre&s;&s;ly, tho' not practically, controuled; for by two acts of parliament made in the 25th of Henry the VIII. and the 3d and 4th of Edward the VI. it is declared that no canons &s;hall be allowed, that be any way repugnant to the laws of God, or the &s;cripture, the king's prerogative royal, and the &s;tatutes of the land.</P>

<P>Agreeable to this maxim Dr. Pinfold, in behalf of the dutche&s;s of Norfolk, pleaded
<PB N="44" REF="49">
that, according to the text law <HI>de divortiis,</HI> if the adultre&s;s <Q>can prove the &s;ame thing again&s;t her hu&s;band, the fault of the one mu&s;t be &s;et again&s;t the fault of the other, and he can't have the advantage of his prayer.</Q> But what is the preci&s;e meaning of all this? Prove the &s;ame thing! what thing? Adultery! or merely carnal copula|tion? Here is a &s;trange want of di&s;crimina|tion. If one fault be to be &s;et again&s;t, or make compen&s;ation for, another; they &s;hould both be proved exactly &s;imilar, or acts of equal criminality. The mere act of copulation, &s;up|po&s;ing it criminal, is no more <HI>adultery,</HI> than the accidentally-killing a man would be <HI>mur|der.</HI> It is the circum&s;tances of the parties, and intention of the per&s;on committing the act, that con&s;titute and di&s;tingui&s;h the crime. Hence, Serjeant Wright very properly replied, <Q>the doctor hath in&s;i&s;ted on one thing, which I think is very extraordinary. He tells you, by the rules of their law, if the woman can recriminate, and prove her hu&s;band guilty,
<PB N="45" REF="50">
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, they mu&s;t &s;et the fault of one again&s;t the fault of the other.&mdash;I wi&s;h the doctor could have told you the offence had been equal, that the injury to families had been equal: A man by his folly of this kind brings no &s;purious i&s;&s;ue to inherit the lands of his wife; but a woman de|prives her hu&s;band of any legitimate i&s;&s;ue; for when &s;he conver&s;es in this manner with another man, the i&s;&s;ue may be equally look'd upon to be that man's, if not more.</Q></P>
<P>To this pertinent plea no &s;ufficient an&s;wer could be given. Sir Thomas Powys indeed en|deavoured to divert the force of it, by aggra|vating the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and making the idle &s;uppo&s;ition, that the debauching a man's wife, with the getting a ba&s;tard to inherit his e&s;tate, is a le&s;s evil than the ca&s;ual contagion of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. <Q>They ridicule</Q> &s;ays he <Q>the doctor's notion of recrimination: But I apprehend the doctor is right in it: for it would be hard if a man &s;hould marry a young woman and give her

an ill example in his own family, (I do not &s;ay 'tis &s;o in this ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No, nor will the circum&s;tance hardly ever be found in any other.</NOTE>) and bring her ac|quainted with loo&s;e and ill company, and by his example or provocation lead her into the &s;ame offence, would that man de&s;erve to be rewarded with a new wife, and another por|tion, becau&s;e his fir&s;t wife had only follow|ed his example? They &s;ay, the offence is not equal, becau&s;e the man brings no chil|dren into the family.

<P>Who does not &s;ee through the fallacy, or rather inanity, of this reply? Should a fooli&s;h hu&s;band, indeed, &s;et his wife an ill example in his own family, and bring her acquainted with his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, as here &s;uppo&s;ed, he cer|tainly would de&s;erve his fate; and the hu&s;|band's

that a married woman, accu&s;ed of adultery by her hu&s;band, mu&s;t alledge farther than, that &s;uch hu&s;band has had carnal knowledge of loo&s;e women; otherwi&s;e &s;he offers not the adequate compen&s;ation required, even by the profe&s;&s;ed rules of the court.</P>
<P>I have indeed gone farther, and &s;hewn that, if &s;he could even prove adultery in him (that is, his wilfully and knowingly lying with another man's wife) that alone would not, ac|cording to the apo&s;tolic and primitive canons, be a &s;ufficient ground for her leaving him.

<P>This latter ca&s;e comes to the argument of Sir Thomas Powys, before quoted, viz. the &s;etting a bad example to the wife; the only circum&s;tance in which the incon|tinence of the hu&s;band can make any compen&s;ation for that of the wife.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55">We &s;ee here that the ancient canons very ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed between the &s;imple act of &s;ecret fornication; which was regarded in a venial light, and the open commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch act in the pre&s;ence, or with the know|ledge of the wife: and, for a very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e, though &s;uch act in the hu&s;|band, ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered and unknown to the wife, was judged a matter of indif|ference, the keeping a &s;trumpet in <HI>his own hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>under her no&s;e,</HI> as the vulgar em|phatically expre&s;s it, was ju&s;tly held to be an in&s;ufferable in&s;ult; which might po&s;&s;ibly provoke her to revenge it, by being on her part guilty of adultery; which is a mo&s;t heinous and abominable crime. Hence mere fornication in the hu&s;band, &s;o circum&s;tanced became a rea&s;onable cau&s;e of divorce, to be pleaded by the wife.</P>
<P>But to return to later principles and prac|tice.</P>
<P>It is certain that the modern and de&s;ultory u&s;e of the word adultery, gives a kind of
<PB N="51" REF="56">
&s;anction to the practice of the &s;piritual court, in mi&s;taking for it mere fornication: but courts of ju&s;tice &s;hould abide by the preci&s;e and technical, not the loo&s;e and popular, meaning of words. If their &s;entence be di|rected by the canons, their proceedings in hearing the cau&s;e &s;hould be directed by the canons too. I &s;ay, therefore, that, if a wife, again&s;t whom a &s;uit is in&s;tituted for a divorce, &s;hould recriminate; the fulle&s;t proof &s;he can bring again&s;t her hu&s;band of <HI>&s;tuprum</HI> or forni|cation, will not be &s;uch a compen&s;ation of her crime, as &s;hould prevent his obtaining his &s;uit.</P>
<P>With regard to recrimination in general, it may not al&s;o be improper to ob&s;erve, that, being u&s;ually the effect of revenge, it has for that rea&s;on been regularly prohibited in ancient practice.</P>
<Q>Antecatagoria, &s;ays Wood, (a cro&s;s ac|cu&s;ation) is either by way of <HI>exception,</HI> when one that is accu&s;ed retorts the &s;ame
<PB N="52" REF="57">
crime upon the accu&s;er, or a different crime, rather for his own defence than for a pub|lick puni&s;hment. For the principal de|&s;ign is, that the accu&s;er &s;hould be &s;ilenced as an infamous per&s;on. Now if the ac|cu&s;ed per&s;on charges a le&s;&s;er crime upon the accu&s;er, he mu&s;t be &s;topp'd, till he was cleared him&s;elf; but if it is a crime of a higher nature, <HI>that</HI> &s;hall be heard fir&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Wood, In&s;t. Book IV. chap. iv. Al&s;o the Code, in locis, to which he has referred.</NOTE></Q>
<P>Now, taking &s;imple fornication for adul|tery, or even admitting real adultery proved again&s;t the hu&s;band, it will hardly be pre|tended that adultery is a greater crime in the hu&s;band than the wife. Nay, it will hardly be pretended that it is not a le&s;s. With what kind of propriety then can a &s;piritual court admit the female plea of recrimination, ac|cording to the modern practice?</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="58">But farther, to deprive the advocates for this practice, even of a &s;hadow of argument in its favour, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the ma|trimonial vow or contract, entered into by per&s;ons married according to the rites and ceremonies of the church of England; not merely as a civil, but al&s;o as a moral cove|nant. And, even in the latter light, it will appear that the hu&s;band, in being guilty of concubinage or mere fornication, is not guil|ty of any breach of &s;uch matrimonial cove|nant; for which he is ju&s;tly liable to cen|&s;ure either in <HI>foro con&s;cientiae</HI> or <HI>court-chri&s;|tian</HI>; although the wife, in being guilty of adultery, is liable to the cen&s;ure of both.</P>
<P>To determine whether a covenant or con|tract is broken, it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to en|quire fully into the &s;en&s;e and meaning of the terms of it. For, as Cicero ob&s;erves, <Q>Quae &agrave; ratione &s;u&s;cipitur de aliqua, re in&s;ti|tutio, debet &agrave; definitione profici&s;ci, ut in|telligatur quid &s;it id de quo di&s;putetur.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Officiis.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="59">The troth plighted in marriage is expre&s;&s;ed, on the part of the man, in the following words: <Q>I.

<P>On the part of the woman, the engage|ment is <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame words, except that the words <HI>and to obey,</HI> are added after the word <HI>cheri&s;h.</HI> In the&s;e few words, of the mo&s;t important con|cern however, lies the difference between the matrimonial contract on the one part and the other, on the &s;ide of the man and that of the woman.</P>
<P>For, by <HI>obedience</HI> is univer&s;ally known and under&s;tood, the acting in conformity to the known will of the per&s;on, to whom &s;uch obedience is due. So that if a hu&s;band
<PB N="55" REF="60">
does not, by &s;ome open conce&s;&s;ion or pal|pable connivance, permit the adultery of his wife, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed to act in di&s;obedience to her hu&s;band; when &s;he is guilty of violating the marriage-bed. For otherwi&s;e &s;he can never conceive it to be con|&s;i&s;tent with her hu&s;band's will, that &s;he &s;hould pro&s;titute her&s;elf to other men, to get children for him to maintain, or to inherit his &s;ub|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Here then is a very e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween the terms of the vow, or matrimonial contract, on the &s;ide of the man and that of the woman. The man promi&s;es the woman no &s;uch obedience. He is not guilty, there|fore of conjugal infidelity, by di&s;obeying her, or acting again&s;t her known will, either by conver&s;ing with other women, or any other act. He may be cruel, wicked and unju&s;t; but, while he continues publickly to hold for better for wor&s;e, for richer for poorer, in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, to love and to cheri&s;h his wife, he may privately
<PB N="56" REF="61">
love and cheri&s;h as many other women as he plea&s;es, without being guilty of conju|gal infidelity, or breach of his matrimonial vow.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that the terms of the que&s;tion put by the mini&s;ter previous to plighting the troth, and to which the hu&s;|band a&s;&s;ents, are under&s;tood in the troth it|&s;elf: I mean, <HI>and for&s;aking all other, keep thee only unto her.</HI> From which it is mi&s;takenly conceived, that the parties promi&s;e to have no carnal commerce with any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>But that this promi&s;e, of <HI>keeping only to</HI> each other, can have no relation whatever to &s;uch commerce, is evident; becau&s;e it is expre&s;&s;ly founded on their <HI>for&s;aking all other</HI> for that purpo&s;e. So that, if we are to take the latter part of the &s;entence in the &s;en&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, we mu&s;t take the former part &s;o too; and the con&s;equence is a direct in&s;inuation that both parties lived before in a &s;tate of concubinage or fornication; which &s;uppo&s;ition would be ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62">It is evident that this pa&s;&s;age means no more than, what is expre&s;&s;ed by the divine command, at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of marriage, when it was &s;aid, <Q>Therefore &s;hall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. ii. v. 24.

The hu&s;band, therefore, doth not bind him&s;elf, either directly or indi|rectly by his marriage-vow, never to be guilty of an act of incontinence; as the wife does, by evident implication, in &s;wearing fealty and obedience.</P>
<P>And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that in the que&s;tion put by the mini&s;ter to the woman, the words <HI>&s;erve him,</HI> are added to tho&s;e <HI>to obey him,</HI> though omitted in the form of the troth. Thus the duty of a married woman is, <HI>&s;worn &s;ervice to</HI> a lord and ma&s;ter; who binds him&s;elf only to provide for, love and cheri&s;h his va&s;&s;al or &s;ervant.

<PB N="58" REF="63">
di&s;charge of the &s;ervice of the va&s;&s;al or &s;ervant is the condition of the obligation on the part of the lord and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>That this con&s;ideration &s;hould be more par|ticularly attended to, in the matrimonial &s;uit and &s;ervice, than in any other feudal tenure, will appear from hence; that the lord has it not in his power to en&s;ure the fidelity of his va&s;&s;al, as in other fiefs. For, though the divine lawgiver in his in&s;titution of marriage expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays to the woman, "Thou &s;halt be under the power of thy hu&s;band," we all know, that the hu&s;band is, with regard to the fealty of his wife and the honour of the marriage-bed, in the power of his wife. The hu&s;band would be in a critical predicament, indeed, therefore, if, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right without the power, he is to contend for the right of puni&s;hing wrong in her, who with|out the right, has the power to do as &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>We have indeed had lawyers ab&s;urd enough to pretend, in ju&s;tification of the practice of

It was not till Uriah, the hu&s;|band of the fair adultre&s;s Bath&s;heba, was &s;lain; till, by the mo&s;t infamous contrivance of the royal adulterer, that brave and loyal officer, had fallen in the "forefront of the hotte&s;t bat|tle," that Nathan was &s;ent by the Lord to reprehend him with "Thou art the man."</P>

<P>Our Saviour indeed goes farther, and ex|plains his meaning di&s;tinctly in adding, <Q>And who&s;o marrieth her which is put away, doth commit adultery.</Q> But how &s;o, unle&s;s the criminality depended on the legal incapacity of the fir&s;t hu&s;band to put her away? This indeed made it adultery in the man marrying a woman thus unju&s;tly divorced, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;till the fir&s;t man's wife, and not lawfully &s;eparated.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The legality of the divorce appears evidently to de|pend on the criminality, on the part of the woman, which <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> di&s;&s;olved the marriage; or, what amounted to the &s;ame thing, gave the hu&s;band a right to do it, at plea|&s;ure by giving his bill of divorce; and this &s;eems to be particularly expre&s;&s;ed in reply to the que&s;tion, "whether a man might put away his wife for <HI>every cau&s;e</HI>;" and al&s;o to the additional que&s;tion, <Q>why then did Mo&s;es com|mand, to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away,</Q> i. e. for every, or any, cau&s;e.&mdash;It is this cir|cum&s;tance, viz. the facility of men's divorcing their wives at plea&s;ure, that accounts for the di&s;u&s;e of polyga|my in countries, where it was allowed by law. It has been already ob&s;erved that the ancient Romans did not indulge them&s;elves in polygamy, though permitted; but this was for a good rea&s;on; they wi&s;ely cho&s;e not to have two wives in the hou&s;e at the &s;ame time, and therefore repudiated one, before they took another; and this they did as often as they plea&s;ed, with no other formality than that of &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to the wife, by a &s;lave, giving notice of their intentions, after the manner of the He|brews.&mdash;</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85">That this was certainly the meaning of our Saviour, cannot be doubted. "Mo&s;es" &s;ays he, <Q>becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of your hearts, &s;uffered you to put away <HI>your wives.</HI></Q> Or rather, as the tran&s;lators have more properly expre&s;&s;ed it in Mark, chap. x. ver. v. "For the hardne&s;s of your <HI>heart.</HI>"</P>
<P>A mere Engli&s;h reader might, from the former expre&s;&s;ion of Matthew, take occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that the term <HI>wives</HI> in the plural, is no more applicable to the individual than that of <HI>hearts</HI>; and that the former word, as well as the latter, mu&s;t be meant of their wives collectively and not of the wives of each

<P>That this is the true &s;en&s;e of the text, is farther confirmed by the remark, which the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us made on it, in the &s;ucceding ver&s;e.</P>
<P>It runs in the vulgar tran&s;lation thus: <Q>If the ca&s;e of <HI>the man</HI> be &s;o with <HI>his wife,</HI> it is good not to marry.</Q></P>
<P>But the ver&s;ion is here al&s;o palpably defec|tive. By <HI>the man</HI> may be mi&s;takenly under|&s;tood a particular <HI>hu&s;band</HI>; and by <HI>his wife,</HI> may, in like manner, be under&s;tood <HI>his</HI> &s;ole and only wife; but the word <HI>his</HI> is foi&s;ted in|to the text; it is indeed u&s;ually printed in Italics, to denote the interpolation. This pro|hibition
<PB N="82" REF="87">
is expre&s;&s;ed, on the contrary, in the mo&s;t general terms. "Si tale e&s;t negotium hominis cum uxore," &s;ays Beza: conform|ably to the original: <GAP DESC="foreign">; not the particular ca&s;e between any one hu&s;band and his &s;ole wife; but the matrimonial commerce (nego|tium) between the &s;exes in general; or, as Pa&s;or explains it, the condition or relative &s;ituation of a hu&s;band re&s;pecting his wives. <HI>Si ea e&s;t conditio viri,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;ori Lexicon, in loco.</NOTE></P>
<P>If any other argument were nece&s;&s;ary, to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;en&s;e of this reply, which our Saviour gave to the de&s;igning phari&s;ees; per|haps &s;ome confirmation of it may be drawn from the que&s;tion, put to him by the &s;adu|ces, with a de&s;ign equally &s;ini&s;ter.</P>

<P>But I am not pleading either for the piety or morality of polygamy. Under the chri&s;|tian di&s;pen&s;ation, and in times like the&s;e, I conceive one wife to be enough for any one man. Add to this, that, whether it be con|trary to the law of God or not, it is ex|pre&s;&s;ly contrary to that of man, being for|bidden in England by the written laws of the land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be ami&s;s, however, to ob&s;erve here, that we are full as incorrect in the modern u&s;e of the word <HI>polygamy,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erved, we are in that of the word <HI>adultery.</HI> Polygamy, &s;ays Burn, is where a man has &s;everal wives at the &s;ame time. He then pro|ceeds to &s;tate the act of parliament, in which the word <HI>per&s;on</HI> is u&s;ed, and a hu&s;band or wife is made equally culpable; as if he had defined polygamy, agreeably to its etymology and antient &s;ignification.</P>
<P>In like manner, Mr. Locke defines polygamy to be "the having more <HI>wives</HI> than one, at once." But this definition re&s;pects the modern, vulgar u&s;e of the word; and is defective, if we regard either the Greek etymology <GAP DESC="foreign">, q. d. marriage with many; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to the acceptation of the term in the Greek, it is affirmed, by J. Pol. Onom. l. iii. to have been a word applicable to either &s;ex. See Harry Stephens's appendix ad The&s;aur. Con&s;tantin.</NOTE> or the &s;tatute, which &s;ubjects the woman to the &s;ame penalty as the man, (ab&s;urdly indeed enough); becau&s;e, it is a felony within the benefit of clergy; &s;o that, by the letter of the law, the woman mu&s;t &s;uffer death for what the man &s;uffers only a burning in the hand, unle&s;s the woman al&s;o be ludicrou&s;ly allowed the benefit of clergy too.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89">From the foregoing arguments, however, I take upon me to infer that matrimony, as a divine ordinance, in&s;tituted in the days of man's innocency, was originally ordained, as is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, for the &s;ake of &s;ociety and the procreation and education of children; to hinder man from being alone; for the peopling of the earth; and for no other direct cau&s;es civil, moral or religious.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o hence follow, that &s;uch married per&s;ons, as &s;o live together to an&s;wer the&s;e great ends of the divine in&s;titution, may be &s;aid to fulfil their matrimonial contract accord|ing to God's holy ordinance.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">Now, not to dwell on the many phy&s;ical and moral rea&s;ons, which might be brought to prove that adultery in the female, ope|rates directly again&s;t the chief ends of this divine in&s;titution; the univer&s;al principles and practice of the patriarchs and &s;ages, both under the law and the go&s;pel, &s;ufficiently confirm it, by their prohibitions and injunc|tions again&s;t this crime; while mere concu|binage or fornication in the man, has been con&s;tantly connived at, or expre&s;&s;ly permitted.</P>
<P>Indeed the great and principal end of mar|riage, procreation, which may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the fir&s;t commandment given by God to man, in the words "increa&s;e and multiply," was &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved by the antient pa|triarchs, that the rai&s;ing up &s;eed unto Abra|ham, was &s;o &s;trictly and &s;olemnly enjoined to his po&s;terity, that it was not to be neg|lected by the man; becau&s;e his wife might happen to be indi&s;po&s;ed, or unmeet, to co-ope|rate with him for that great purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="91">The conduct of Abraham and Sarah, re|&s;pecting her Egyptian handmaid Hagar, proves the due &s;en&s;e they had of the na|ture of God's holy ordinance of marriage; in&s;tituted, as our matrimonial &s;ervice &s;ays, in the days of man's innocence.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Jacob al&s;o, and his two wives Rachel and Leah, is a farther more forcible confirmation of the &s;en&s;e in which the duties of marriage were held under the patriarchal di&s;pen&s;ation. During their tem|porary barrenne&s;s, both Rachel and Leah gave to their hu&s;band their re&s;pective hand|maids Bilhah and Zilpah; nay Leah expre&s;&s;ly imputes the cure of her &s;terility to this act of duty and complacence. <Q>And God heark|ened unto Leah and &s;he conceived and bare Jacob the fifth &s;on.&mdash;And Leah &s;aid, God hath ble&s;&s;ed and given me mine hire, becau&s;e I have given my maiden to my hu&s;band.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. xx. ver. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="92">But, though concubinage, now called for|nication, was then deemed not only lawful in the hu&s;band, but the contributing to it, in ca&s;e of barrenne&s;s, meritorious in the wife, we find the act of adultery, or lying with another man's wife, univer&s;ally regarded with horror, even among the Egyptians and Phili&s;tines. Thus when Abraham denied Sarah to be his wife, and &s;aid &s;he was his &s;i&s;ter; in con&s;equence of which &s;he was taken from him by Abimelech, the preven|tion of adultery was deemed &s;o important and momentous a concern; that God him|&s;elf is &s;aid to have appeared in a dream, by night to Abimelech; &s;aying, <Q>Behold thou art a dead man, for the woman thou ha&s;t taken; for &s;he is a <HI>man's</HI> WIFE!</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. xx. ver. 3.

Ver&s;e 17. et &s;eq.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again, when I&s;aac went up, on account of a famine in his own country, to dwell
<PB N="88" REF="93">
in Gerar, and denied, in the &s;ame manner, his wife Rebeka; &s;aying al&s;o that &s;he was his &s;i&s;ter; he received a &s;evere rebuke from Abimelech for thus laying his people under the temptation of inadvertently committing even unintentional adultery. <Q>And it came to pa&s;s when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Phili&s;tines look|ed out at a window, and &s;aw, and behold, I&s;aac was &s;porting with Rebekah his wife. And Abimelech called I&s;aac, and &s;aid, be|hold, of a &s;urety &s;he is thy wife: and how &s;aid'&s;t thou, "&s;he is my &s;i&s;ter?" What is this thou ha&s;t done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou &s;hould'&s;t have brought guil|tine&s;s upon us.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. xxvi. ver. 8. et &s;eq.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, it will hardly be pretended by either our canoni&s;ts or divines, that Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, though polygami&s;ts and <HI>fornica|tors</HI> (to &s;peak our modern language) did not live in the &s;tate of matrimony, according
<PB N="89" REF="94">
to God's holy ordinance, if that ordinance was, as is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid in the matrimonial &s;er|vice of the church of England, in&s;tituted in the days of man's innocency!</P>
<P>The prohibition of poligamy and concu|binage is a mere civil prohibition, of much later date than the days of man's innocency, or tho&s;e of the patriarchs.</P>
<P>The pretence that marriage was in&s;tituted for the &s;econd cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned in the matrimo|nial &s;ervice, is therefore evidently fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Not but that the <HI>liberty,</HI> taken by a hu&s;band in concubinage may degenerate in|to <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and be carried &s;o far as to make him neglect the duties of the marriage-bed, the &s;ociety of his wife, and the education of his children. If it &s;hould prevent his loving and cheri&s;hing her, &s;o far as is requi&s;ite to an&s;wer the real ends of the matrimonial in&s;titution, &s;uch hu&s;band is guilty of a breach of his matrimonial vow,
<PB N="90" REF="95">
and is <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae</HI> highly reprehen&s;ible: nay, if his neglect of the nuptial duty be open, gro&s;s and wilful, the <HI>court-chri&s;tian</HI> may take cognizance of it; and, at the wife's requi&s;i|tion, decree a re&s;titution of conjugal rights;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone, on private wrongs.

<P>At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be admitted, that with regard to men, entering into the ma|trimonial &s;tate without di&s;criminating the terms of the contract, thinking they are equally bound with their wives to live a life of perfect cha&s;tity, they are certainly repre|hen&s;ible <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae</HI> if they are guilty of incontinence; altho' not &s;o criminal, ac|cording to the canons, as incontinent <HI>wives,</HI> who cannot mi&s;take the meaning of the contract, and are bound, by all laws, human and divine, to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t fidelity to their HUSBANDS.</P>
