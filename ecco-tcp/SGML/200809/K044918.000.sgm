<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY-PLAIN.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy cha|ritable Gentleman, was travelling &s;ome time ago acro&s;s one of tho&s;e va&s;t Plains which are well known in Wilt&s;hire. It was a fine &s;ummer's evening, and he rode &s;lowly that he might have lei&s;ure to ad|mire God in the works of his creation. For this Gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride, was as proper a time as any to think about good things, for which rea&s;on, on &s;uch occa&s;ions he &s;eldom thought &s;o much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfac|tion enjoy the pious thoughts which the vi&s;ible works of the great Maker of hea|ven and earth are intended to rai&s;e in the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
His attention was all of a &s;udden called off by the barking of a Shepherd's dog, and looking up he &s;pied one of tho&s;e little huts, which are here and there to be &s;een on the&s;e great Downs; and near it was the Shepherd him&s;elf bu&s;ily employed with his dog in collecting together his va&s;t flock of &s;heep. As he drew nearer he perceived him to be a clean, well|looking, poor man, near fifty years of age. His coat, though at fir&s;t it had pro|bably been of one dark colour, had been in a long cour&s;e of years &s;o often patched with different &s;orts of cloth, that it was now become hard to &s;ay which had been the original colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the Shepherd's po|verty, equally proved the exceeding neat|ne&s;s, indu&s;try, and good management of his wife. His &s;tockings no le&s;s proved her good hou&s;ewifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different coloured wor&s;ted, but had not a hole in them; and his &s;hirt, though nearly as coar&s;e as the &s;ails of a &s;hip, was as white as the drifted &s;now, and neatly mended where time had either made a rent, or worn it thin. This is a rule of judging, by which one &s;hall &s;eldom be deceived. If I meet with a labourer, hedging, ditch|ing, or mending the highways with his &s;tockings and &s;hirt tight and whole, how|ever mean and bad his other garments are,
<PB N="5" REF="4">I have &s;eldom fared, on vi&s;iting his cot|tage, to find that al&s;o clean and well or|dered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor woman, who will be lying a-bed, or go&s;&s;ipping with her neighbours when &s;he ought to be fitting out her hu&s;band in a cleanly manner, will &s;eldom be found to be very good in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>This was not the ca&s;e with our Shep|herd: And Mr. John&s;on was not more &s;truck with the decency of his mean and frugal dre&s;s, than with his open hone&s;t countenance, which bore &s;trong marks of health, cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, who was on a journey, and &s;omewhat fearful from the appearance of the &s;ky, that rain was at no great di&s;|tance, acco&s;ted the Shepherd with a&s;king what &s;ort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.&mdash;"It will be &s;uch wea|ther as plea&s;es me," an&s;wered the Shep|herd. Though the an&s;wer was delivered in the milde&s;t and civile&s;t tone that could be imagined, the Gentleman thought the words them&s;elves rather rude and &s;urly, and a&s;ked him how that could be, "Be|cau&s;e," replied the Shepherd, "it will be &s;uch weather as &s;hall plea&s;e God, and whatever plea&s;es him always plea&s;es me."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
Mr. John&s;on, who delighted in good men and good things, was very well &s;atis|fied with his reply. For he ju&s;tly thought that though an hypocrite may ea&s;ily con|trive to appear better than he really is to a &s;tranger; and that no one &s;hould be too &s;oon tru&s;ted, merely for having a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh," he always accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to judge favourably of tho&s;e who had a &s;erious deportment and &s;olid manner of &s;peaking. "It looks as if it proceeded from a good habit," &s;aid he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be &s;o. Whereas, if a man acco&s;ts me with an idle, di&s;&s;olute, vulgar, indecent, or prophane expre&s;&s;ion, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally on inquiry found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</P>
<P>He entered into conver&s;ation with the Shepherd in the following manner. Yours is a trouble&s;ome life, hone&s;t friend, &s;aid he. To be &s;ure, Sir, replied the Shepherd, 'tis not a very lazy life; but 'tis not near &s;o toil&s;ome as that which my GREAT MAS|TER led for my &s;ake, and he had every &s;tate and condition of life at his choice, and cho&s;e a hard one&mdash;while I only &s;ubmit
<PB N="7" REF="6">to the lot that is appointed me.&mdash;You are expo&s;ed to great cold and heat, &s;aid the Gentleman;&mdash;true, Sir, &s;aid the Shepherd; but then I am not expo&s;ed to great temp|tations; and &s;o throwing one thing again&s;t another, God is plea&s;ed to contrive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's &s;heep on &s;uch a plain as this, and &s;inging &s;ome of his own P&s;alms perhaps, than ever he was when he became king of I&s;rael and Judah. And I dare &s;ay we &s;hould never have had &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful texts in all tho&s;e fine P&s;alms, if he had not been a Shep|herd, which enabled him to make &s;o many fine compari&s;ons and &s;imilitudes, as one may &s;ay, from a country life, flocks of &s;heep, hills, and vallies, and fountains of water.</P>
<P>You think then, &s;aid the Gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, Sir, and more &s;o e&s;pecially, as it expo&s;es a man to fewer &s;ins. If King Saul had con|tinued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and hone&s;t, and died a natural death in his bed at la&s;t, which you know, Sir, was more than he did. But I &s;peak with reve|rence, for it was divine Providence over|ruled all that, you know, Sir, and I do
<PB N="8" REF="7">not pre&s;ume to make compari&s;ons. Be|&s;ides, Sir, my employment has been par|ticularly honoured&mdash;Mo&s;es was a Shep|herd in the plains of Midian.&mdash;It was to "Shepherds keeping their flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Beth|lehem, to tell the be&s;t news, the gladde&s;t tidings, that ever were revealed to poor &s;inful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the colde&s;t night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulne&s;s than the be&s;t &s;upper could have done.</P>
<P>Here the Shepherd &s;topped, for he be|gan to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. John&s;on was &s;o well plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he &s;aid it, that he de&s;ired him to go on freely, for that it was a plea&s;ure to him to meet with a plain man, who without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk &s;o well on a &s;ubject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</P>
<P>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, Sir, for it better becomes me to li&s;ten to &s;uch a Gentleman as you &s;eem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was &s;ay|ing, Sir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do
<PB N="9" REF="8">from thinking how God has honoured poverty! Oh! Sir, what great, or rich, or mighty men have had &s;uch honour put on them, or their condition, as Shep|herds, Tent-makers, Fi&s;hermen, and Car|penters have had?</P>
<P>My hone&s;t friend, &s;aid the Gentleman, I perceive you are well acquainted with &s;cripture. Yes, Sir, pretty well, ble&s;&s;ed be God! through his mercy I learnt to read when I was a little boy; though read|ing was not &s;o common when I was a child, as, I am told, through the good|ne&s;s of Providence, and the genero&s;ity of the rich, it is likely to become now a-days. I believe there is no day for the la&s;t thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible. If we can't find time to read a chapter, I defy any man to &s;ay he can't find time to read a ver&s;e; and a &s;ingle text Sir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and &s;ixty-five texts, without the lo&s;s of a moment's time, would make a pretty &s;tock, a little golden trea&s;ury, as one may &s;ay, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfa&s;t. No labouring man, 'tis true, has &s;o much lei&s;ure as a Shepherd,
<PB N="10" REF="9">for while the flock is feeding, I am oblig|ed to be &s;till, and at &s;uch times I can now and then tap a &s;hoe for my children or my|&s;elf, which is a great &s;aving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time pa&s;s plea|&s;antly in this wild &s;olitary place. I can &s;ay the be&s;t part of the Bible by heart, I be|lieve I &s;hould not &s;ay the be&s;t part, for every part is good, but I mean the greate&s;t part. I have led but a lonely life, and have often had but little to eat, but my Bible has been meat, drink and company to me, as I may &s;ay, and when want and trouble have come upon me, I don't know what I &s;hould have done indeed, Sir, if I had not had the promi&s;es of this book for my &s;tay and &s;upport.</P>
<P>You have had great difficulties then? &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. Why, as to that, Sir, not more than neighbours fare, I have but little cau&s;e to complain, and much to be thankful; but I have had &s;ome little &s;truggles, as I will leave you to judge. I have a wife and eight children, whom I bred up in that little cottage which you &s;ee under the hill about half a mile off. What, that with the &s;moke coming out of the chimney, &s;aid the Gentleman. O no, Sir, replied the Shep|herd &s;miling, we have &s;eldom &s;moke in the evening, for we have little to cook,
<PB N="11" REF="10">and firing is very dear in the&s;e parts. 'Tis that cottage which you &s;ee on the left hand of the Church, near that little tuft of haw|thorns. What that hovel with only one room above and one below, with &s;carcely any chimney, how is it po&s;&s;ible you can live there with &s;uch a family! O! it is very po&s;&s;ible and very certain too, cried the Shepherd. How many better men have been wor&s;e lodged! how many good chri&s;tians have peri&s;hed in pri&s;ons and dungeons, in compari&s;on of which my cot|tage is a palace. The hou&s;e is very well, Sir, and if the rain did not &s;ometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a bed, I &s;hould not de&s;ire a bet|ter; for I have health, peace, and liberty, and no man maketh me afraid.</P>
<P>Well, I will certainly call on you be|fore it be long; but how can you con|trive to lodge &s;o many children? We do the be&s;t we can, Sir. My poor wife is a very &s;ickly woman, or we &s;hould always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the pari&s;h, &s;o that &s;he has not met with any great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her &s;ick|ne&s;s. The good curate of the pari&s;h who lives in that pretty par&s;onage in the val|ley, is very willing, but not very able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us on the&s;e trying occa&s;ions, for he has little enough for him&s;elf and a large family into the bargain. Yet he does
<PB N="12" REF="11">what he can, and more than many richer men do, and more than he can well af|ford. Be&s;ides that, his prayers and good advice we are always &s;ure of, and we are truly thankful for that, for a man mu&s;t give, you know, Sir, according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not.</P>
<P>Are you in any di&s;tre&s;s at pre&s;ent? &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. No, Sir, thank God, re|plied the Shepherd. I get my &s;hilling a day, and mo&s;t of my children will &s;oon be able to earn &s;omething; for we have only three under five years of age. Only! &s;aid the Gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it. Though my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet &s;he breeds up our chil|dren to &s;uch habits of indu&s;try that our little maids before they are &s;ix years old can fir&s;t get a halfpenny, and then a pen|ny a day by knitting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or two|pence, and now and then a bit of bread and chee&s;e into the bargain. When the &s;ea&s;on of crow keeping is over, then they glean or pick &s;tones; any thing is better than idlene&s;s, Sir, and if they do not get a farthing by it, I would make them do it ju&s;t the &s;ame, for the &s;ake of giving them early habits of labour.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
So you &s;ee, Sir, I am not &s;o badly off as many are; nay, if it were not that it co&s;ts me &s;o much in 'Potecary's &s;tuff for my poor wife, I &s;hould reckon my&s;elf well off. Nay, I do reckon my&s;elf well off, for ble&s;&s;|ed be God, he has granted her life to my prayers, and I would work my&s;elf to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">natomy, and live on one meal a day to add any comfort to her valuable life; in|deed I have often done the la&s;t, and thought it no great matter neither.</P>
<P>While they were in this part of the di&s;|cour&s;e, a fine plump cherry-cheek little girl ran up out of breath, with a &s;mile on her young happy face, and without taking any notice of the Gentleman, cried out with great joy&mdash;Look here, fa|ther, only &s;ee how much I have got to|day! Mr. John&s;on was much &s;truck with her &s;implicity, but puzzled to know what was the occa&s;ion of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a &s;mall quan|tity of coar&s;e wool, &s;ome of which had found it's way through the holes of her clean, but &s;canty and ragged woollen apron. The father &s;aid, this has been a &s;ucce&s;sful day indeed, Molly, but don't you &s;ee the Gentleman? Molly now made a curt&s;ey down to the very ground; while Mr. John&s;on inquired into the cau&s;e of the mutual &s;atisfaction which both father
<PB N="14" REF="13">and daughter had expre&s;&s;ed, at the un|u&s;ual good fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the Shepherd, poverty is a great &s;harpener of wits.&mdash;My wife and I cannot endure to &s;ee our children (poor as they are) without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, not only on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but becau&s;e it degrades and deba&s;es them; and poor people who have but little re|gard to appearances will &s;eldom be found to have any great regard for hone&s;ty and goodne&s;s; I don't &s;ay this is always the ca&s;e; but I am &s;ure it is &s;o too often. Now &s;hoes and &s;tockings being very dear we could never afford to get them with|out a little contrivance. I mu&s;t &s;hew you how I manage about the &s;hoes when you conde&s;cend to call at our cottage, Sir; as to &s;tockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, &s;ometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the &s;heep may drop when they rub them|&s;elves, as they are apt to do, in the bu&s;hes. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece of frugal indu&s;try is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the Shepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the &s;criptures</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;cattered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which I &s;ee, have torn &s;ad holes in
<PB N="15" REF="14">Molly's apron to-day; they carry this wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for we can &s;it and card in the chim|ney corner, when &s;he is not able to wa&s;h, or work about hou&s;e. The bigge&s;t girl then &s;pins it; it does very well for us without dying, for poor people mu&s;t not &s;tand for the colour of their &s;tockings. After this our little boys knit it for them|&s;elves, while they are employed in keep|ing crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chiefly for &s;ale, which helps to pay our rent.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on lifted up his eyes in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;hifts which hone&s;t poverty can make rather than beg or &s;teal; and was &s;urpri&s;ed to think how many ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting there are which tho&s;e who live at their ea&s;e little &s;u&s;pect. He &s;ecret|ly re&s;olved to be more attentive to his own petty expences than he had hitherto been; and to be more watchful that no|thing was wa&s;ted in his family.</P>
<P>But to return to the Shepherd. Mr. John&s;on told him that as he mu&s;t needs be at his friend's hou&s;e, who lived many miles off that night, he could not as he wi&s;hed to do, make a vi&s;it to his cottage at pre&s;ent. But I will certainly do it,
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;aid he, on my return, for I long to &s;ee your wife and her nice little family, and to be an eye witne&s;s of her neatne&s;s and good management. The poor man's tears &s;tarted into his eyes on hearing the com|mendation be&s;towed on his wife; and wiping them off with the &s;leeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handker|chief in the world, he &s;aid&mdash;Oh! Sir, you ju&s;t now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. John|&s;on, I hope not&mdash;Pride is a great &s;in, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, &s;o good a man as you &s;eem to be, ought to guard again&s;t it. Sir, &s;aid he, you are right, but I am not proud of my&s;elf, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor &s;inner, but indeed Sir, I am proud of my wife: She is not only the mo&s;t tidy, notable wo|man on the Plain, but &s;he is the kinde&s;t wife and mother, and the mo&s;t con|tented, thankful chri&s;tian that I know. La&s;t year I thought I &s;hould have lo&s;t her in a violent fit of the rheumati&s;m, caught by going to work too &s;oon after her lying-in, I fear; for 'tis but a bleak coldi&s;h place, as you may &s;ee, Sir, in winter, and &s;ometimes the &s;now lies &s;o long under the hill, that I can hardly make my&s;elf a path to get out and buy a few nece&s;&s;aries in the next village; and
<PB N="17" REF="16">we are afraid to &s;end out the children, for fear they &s;hould be lo&s;t when the &s;now is deep. So, as I was &s;aying, the poor &s;oul was very bad indeed, and for &s;everal weeks lo&s;t the u&s;e of all her limbs except her hands: a merciful Providence &s;pared her the u&s;e of the&s;e, &s;o that when &s;he could not turn in her bed, &s;he could contrive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always &s;aying, had it not been for the great goodne&s;s of God, &s;he might have had the pal&s;y in&s;tead of the rheumati&s;m, and then &s;he could have done nothing&mdash;but nobody had &s;o many mercies as &s;he had.</P>
<P>I will not tell you what we &s;uffered during that bitter weather, Sir, but my wife's faith and patience during that try|ing time, were as good a le&s;&s;on to me as any Sermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>One Sunday afternoon when my wife was at the wor&s;t, as I was coming out of Church, for I went one part of the day, and my elde&s;t daughter the other, &s;o my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of Church, I &s;ay, Mr. Jenkins the mini&s;ter called out to me, and a&s;ked me how my wife did, &s;aying he had been
<PB N="18" REF="17">kept from coming to &s;ee her by the deep fall of &s;now, and indeed from the par&s;on|age-hou&s;e to my hovel it was quite im|pa&s;&s;able. I gave him all the particulars he a&s;ked, and I am afraid a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a &s;hilling, and &s;aid he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and &s;ee her in a day or two.</P>
<P>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking Gentleman in boots, who &s;tood by, li&s;tened to all I &s;aid, but &s;eem|ed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas holidays at the par&s;onage-hou&s;e. I had always heard him &s;poken of as a plain frugal man, who lived clo&s;e him&s;elf, but was remarked to give away more than any of his &s;how-away neighbours.</P>
<P>Well! I went home with great &s;pirits at this &s;ea&s;onable and unexpected &s;upply; for we had tapped our la&s;t &s;ix-pence, and there was little work to be had on account of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty handed. No, I dare &s;ay not, &s;ays &s;he, you have been &s;erving a ma&s;ter "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he &s;endeth the rich empty away." True, Mary, &s;ays I; we &s;eldom fail to get good &s;piritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to-day he has
<PB N="19" REF="18">kindly &s;upplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I &s;hewed her the &s;hilling, than, I dare &s;ay, &s;ome of your great people are when they get a hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on's heart &s;mote him when he heard &s;uch a value &s;et upon a &s;hilling; &s;urely, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, I will never wa&s;te another; but he &s;aid nothing to the Shepherd, who thus pur&s;ued his &s;tory.</P>
<P>Next morning before I went out, I &s;ent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown &s;ugar to put into her water gruel; which you know, Sir, made it nice and nouri&s;hing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm-yard, for there was no &s;tanding out on the plain, after &s;uch a &s;now as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than u&s;ual, becau&s;e I had left my poor wife a little better; and comfortably &s;upplied for this day, and I now re&s;olved more than ever to tru&s;t in God for the &s;upplies of the next. When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me. This, I own I thought but a bad return for the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he had &s;o lately received, and &s;o I told her. O, &s;aid &s;he, it is too much, we are too rich; I am now frightened, not le&s;t we &s;hould have no portion in this world, but for fear we &s;hould have our whole portion
<PB N="20" REF="19">in it. Look here, John! So &s;aying &s;he uncovered the bed whereon &s;he lay, and &s;hewed me two warm, thick, new blank|ets. I could not believe my own eyes, Sir, becau&s;e when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was &s;till more amazed when &s;he put half a crown into my hand, telling me &s;he had had a vi&s;it from Mr. Jenkins, and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had be&s;towed all the&s;e good things upon us. Thus, Sir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to the&s;e comforts; for the rheumati&s;m, Sir, without blankets by night and flannel by day, is but a bad|di&s;h job, e&s;pecially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly body; but thank God her &s;oul pro&s;pers and is in health. But I beg your pardon, Sir, for talking on at this rate. Not at all, not at all, &s;aid Mr. John&s;on; I am much plea&s;ed with your &s;tory, you &s;hall certainly &s;ee me in a few days. Good night. So &s;aying, he &s;lipped a crown into his hand, and rode off. Sure|ly, &s;aid the Shepherd, <HI>goodne&s;s and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</HI> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
As to Mr. John&s;on, he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the re&s;t of his journey. On the whole he was more di&s;po&s;ed to envy than to pity the Shep|herd. I have &s;eldom &s;een, &s;aid he, &s;o happy a man. It is a &s;ort of happine&s;s which the world could not give, and which I plainly &s;ee, it has not been able to take away. This mu&s;t be the true &s;pirit of Religion. I &s;ee more and more, that true goodne&s;s is not merely a thing of words and opinions, but a Living Principle brought into every-common ac|tion of a man's life. What el&s;e could have &s;upported this poor couple under every bitter trial of want, and &s;ickne&s;s? No, my hone&s;t Shepherd, I do not pity, but I re&s;pect and even honour thee; and I will vi&s;it thy poor hovel on my return to Sali&s;bury with as much plea&s;ure as I am now going to the hou&s;e of my friend.</P>
<P>If Mr. John&s;on keeps his word in &s;end|ing me the account of his vi&s;it to the Shepherd's cottage, I &s;hall be very glad to entertain my readers with it, and &s;hall conclude this fir&s;t part with</P>
