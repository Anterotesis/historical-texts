<P>SCARCELY had the abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capuchins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was a&s;&s;embled either from mo|tives of piety or thir&s;t of information. But very few were influenced by tho&s;e rea&s;ons; and in a city where &s;uper&s;tition reigns with
<PB N="2" REF="8">
&s;uch de&s;potic &s;way as in Madrid, to &s;eek for true devotion would be a fruitle&s;s attempt. The audience now a&s;&s;embled in the Ca|puchin church was collected by various cau&s;es, but all of them were foreign to the o&s;ten&s;ible motive. The women came to &s;how them&s;elves, the men to &s;ee the women: &s;ome were attracted by curio&s;ity to hear an orator &s;o celebrated; &s;ome came, becau&s;e they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; &s;ome, from being a&s;&s;ured that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thi|ther by expecting to meet the other half. The only per&s;ons truly anxious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated devotees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the di&s;|cour&s;e. As to the remainder of the au|dience, the &s;ermon might have been omit|ted altogether, certainly without their being di&s;appointed, and very probably without their perceiving the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">Whatever was the occa&s;ion, it is at lea&s;t certain, that the Capuchin church had never witne&s;&s;ed a more numerous a&s;&s;em|bly. Every corner was filled, every &s;eat was occupied. The very &s;tatues which ornamented the long ai&s;les were pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice. Boys &s;u&s;pended them&s;elves upon the wings of cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a &s;pectator on his &s;houlders; and St. Agatha found her&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying double. The con&s;equence was, that, in &s;pite of all their hurry and expedition, our two new|comers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places.</P>
<P>However, the old woman continued to move forwards. In vain were exclama|tions of di&s;plea&s;ure vented again&s;t her from all &s;ides: in vain was &s;he addre&s;&s;ed with&mdash;"I a&s;&s;ure you, Segnora, there are no places here,"&mdash;"I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me &s;o intolerably!"&mdash; "Segnora, you cannot pa&s;s this way. Ble&s;s me! How can people be &s;o trouble|&s;ome!"
<PB N="4" REF="10">
&mdash;The old woman was ob&s;tinate, and on &s;he went. By dint of per&s;everance and two brawny arms &s;he made a pa&s;&s;age through the crowd, and managed to bu&s;tle her&s;elf into the very body of the church, at no great di&s;tance from the pulpit. Her companion had followed her with timidity and in &s;ilence, profiting by the exertions of her conductre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the old woman in a tone of di&s;appointment, while &s;he threw a glance of enquiry round her; "Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we mu&s;t return: there is no &s;uch thing as a &s;eat to be had, and no|body &s;eems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs."</P>
<P>This broad hint attracted the notice of two cavaliers, who occupied &s;tools on the right hand, and were leaning their backs again&s;t the &s;eventh column from the pul|pit. Both were young, and richly habited. Hearing this appeal to their politene&s;s pro|nounced
<PB N="5" REF="11">
in a female voice, they interrupted their conver&s;ation to look at the &s;peaker. She had thrown up her veil in order to take a clearer look round the cathedral. Her hair was red, and &s;he &s;quinted. The cava|liers turned round, and renewed their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"By all means," replied the old woman's companion; "by all means, Leonella, let us return home immediately; the heat is exce&s;&s;ive, and I am terrified at &s;uch a crowd."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were pronounced in a tone of unexampled &s;weetne&s;s. The cavaliers again broke off their di&s;cour&s;e, but for this time they were not contented with looking up: both &s;tarted involuntarily from their feats, and turned them&s;elves towards the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The voice came from a female, the deli|cacy and elegance of who&s;e figure in&s;pired the youths with the mo&s;t lively curio&s;ity to view the face to which it belonged. This &s;atisfaction was denied them. Her
<PB N="6" REF="12">
features were hidden by a thick veil; but &s;truggling through the crowd had de|ranged it &s;ufficiently to di&s;cover a neck which for &s;ymmetry and beauty might have vied with the Medicean Venus. It was of the mo&s;t dazzling whitene&s;s, and received additional charms from being &s;haded by the tre&s;&s;es of her long fair hair, which de|&s;cended in ringlets to her wai&s;t. Her figure was rather below than above the middle &s;ize: it was light and airy as that of an Hamadryad. Her bo&s;om was carefully veiled. Her dre&s;s was white; it was fa&s;tened by a blue &s;a&s;h, and ju&s;t permitted to peep out from under it a little foot of the mo&s;t delicate proportions. A chaplet of large grains hung upon her arm, and her face was covered with a veil of thick black gauze. Such was the female, to whom the younge&s;t of the cavaliers now offered his &s;eat, while the other thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pay the &s;ame attention to her companion.</P>
<P>The old lady with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, but without much difficulty, ac|cepted
<PB N="7" REF="13">
the offer, and &s;eated her&s;elf: the young one followed her example, but made no other compliment than a &s;imple and graceful reverence. Don Lorenzo (&s;uch was the cavalier's name, who&s;e &s;eat &s;he had accepted) placed him&s;elf near her; but fir&s;t he whi&s;pered a few words in his friend's ear, who immediately took the hint, and endeavoured to draw off the old woman's attention from her lovely charge.</P>
<P>"You are doubtle&s;s lately arrived at Madrid," &s;aid Lorenzo to his fair neigh|bour; "it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch charms &s;hould have long remained unob&s;erved; and had not this been your fir&s;t public appear|ance, the envy of the women and adoration of the men would have rendered you al|ready &s;ufficiently remarkable."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, in expectation of an an&s;wer. As his &s;peech did not ab&s;olutely require one, the lady did not open her lips: After a few moments he re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>"Am I wrong in &s;uppo&s;ing you to be a &s;tranger to Madrid?"</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">The lady he&s;itated; and at la&s;t, in &s;o low a voice as to be &s;carcely intelligible, &s;he made &s;hift to an&s;wer,&mdash;"No, Segnor."</P>
<P>"Do you intend making a &s;tay of any length?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Segnor."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf fortunate, were it in my power to contribute to making your abode agreeable. I am well known at Madrid, and my family has &s;ome intere&s;t at court, If I can be of any &s;ervice, you cannot honour or oblige me more than by permitting me to be of u&s;e to you."&mdash;"Sure|ly," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "&s;he cannot an&s;wer that by a mono&s;yllable; now &s;he mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething to me."</P>
<P>Lorenzo was deceived, for the lady an|&s;wered only by a bow.</P>
<P>By this time he had di&s;covered, that his neighbour was not very conver&s;ible; but whether her &s;ilence proceeded from pride, di&s;cretion, timidity, or idioti&s;m, he was &s;till unable to decide.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes&mdash;"It
<PB N="9" REF="15">
is certainly from your being a &s;tranger," &s;aid he, "and as yet unacquainted with our cu&s;toms, that you continue to wear your veil. Permit me to remove it."</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he advanced his hand towards the gauze: the lady rai&s;ed hers to prevent him.</P>
<P>"I never unveil in public, Segnor."</P>
<P>"And where is the harm, I pray you?" interrupted her companion &s;omewhat &s;harp|ly. "Do not you &s;ee, that the other ladies have all laid their veils a&s;ide, to do honour no doubt to the holy place in which we are? I have taken off mine already; and &s;urely, if I expo&s;e my features to general ob&s;ervation, you have no cau&s;e to put your|&s;elf in &s;uch a wonderful alarm! Ble&s;&s;ed Maria! Here is a fu&s;s and a bu&s;tle about a chit's face! Come, come, child! Unco|ver it! I warrant you that nobody will run away with it from you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Dear aunt, it is not the cu&s;tom in Murcia&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Murcia, indeed! Holy St. Barbara,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
what does that &s;ignify? You are always put|ting me in mind of that villanous province. If it is the cu&s;tom in Madrid, that is all that we ought to mind; and therefore I de|&s;ire you to take off your veil immediately. Obey me this moment, Antonia, for you know that I cannot bear contradiction."</P>
<P>Her niece was &s;ilent, but made no fur|ther oppo&s;ition to Don Lorenzo's efforts, who, armed with the aunt's &s;anction, ha&s;|tened to remove the gauze. What a &s;eraph's head pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his ad|miration! Yet it was rather bewitching than beautiful; it was not &s;o lovely from regularity of features, as from &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of countenance. The &s;eve|ral parts of her face con&s;idered &s;eparately, many of them were far from hand&s;ome; but, when examined together, the whole was adorable. Her &s;kin, though fair, was not entirely without freckles; her eyes were not very large, nor their la&s;hes particularly long. But then her lips were of the mo&s;t ro&s;y fre&s;hne&s;s; her fair and undulating hair,
<PB N="11" REF="17">
confined by a &s;imple ribband, poured it&s;elf below her wai&s;t in a profu&s;ion of ringlets; her neck was full and beautiful in the extreme; her hand and arm were form|ed with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymmetry; her mild blue eyes &s;eemed an heaven of &s;weet|ne&s;s, and the cry&s;tal in which they mov|ed &s;parkled with all the brilliance of dia|monds. She appeared to be &s;carcely fif|teen; an arch &s;mile, playing round her mouth, declared her to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liveline&s;s, which exce&s;s of timidity at pre|&s;ent repre&s;&s;ed. She looked round her with a ba&s;hful glance; and whenever her eyes ac|cidentally met Lorenzo's, &s;he dropped them ha&s;tily upon her ro&s;ary; her cheek was immediately &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes, and &s;he began to tell her beads; though her manner evidently &s;howed that &s;he knew not what &s;he was about.</P>
<P>Lorenzo gazed upon her with mingled &s;urpri&s;e and admiration; but the aunt thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for An|tonia's <HI>mauvai&s;e honte.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">"'Tis a young creature," &s;aid &s;he, "who is totally ignorant of the world. She has been brought up in an old ca&s;tle in Mur|cia, with no other &s;ociety than her mo|ther's, who, God help her! has no more &s;en&s;e, good &s;oul, than is nece&s;&s;ary to carry her &s;oup to her mouth. Yet &s;he is my own &s;i&s;ter, both by father and mother."</P>
<P>"And has &s;o little &s;en&s;e?" &s;aid Don Chri&s;toval with feigned a&s;toni&s;hment. "How very extraordinary!"</P>
<P>"Very true, Segnor. Is it not &s;trange? However, &s;uch is the fact; and yet only to &s;ee the luck of &s;ome people! A young nobleman, of the very fir&s;t quality, took it into his head that Elvira had &s;ome pre|ten&s;ions to beauty.&mdash;As to preten&s;ions, in truth &s;he had always enough of <HI>them</HI>; but as to beauty!&mdash;If I had only taken half the pains to &s;et my&s;elf off which &s;he did!&mdash; But this is neither here nor there. As I was &s;aying, Segnor, a young nobleman fell in love with her, and married her un|known to his father. Their union remained
<PB N="13" REF="19">
a &s;ecret near three years; but at la&s;t it came to the ears of the old marquis, who, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, was not much plea&s;ed with the intelligence. Away he po&s;ted in all ha&s;te to Cordova, determined to &s;eize Elvira, and &s;end her away to &s;ome place or other, where &s;he would never be heard of more. Holy St. Paul! How he &s;tormed on finding that &s;he had e&s;caped him, had joined her hu&s;band, and that they had embarked together for the Indies! He &s;wore at us all, as if the evil &s;pirit had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him; he threw my father into pri|&s;on&mdash;as hone&s;t a pains-taking &s;hoe-maker as any in Cordova; and when he went away, he had the cruelty to take from us my &s;i&s;ter's little boy, then &s;carcely two years old, and whom in the abruptne&s;s of her flight &s;he had been obliged to leave behind her. I &s;uppo&s;e that the poor little wretch met with bitter bad treatment from him, for in a few months after we received in|telligence of his death."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">"Why, this was a mo&s;t terrible old fellow, Segnora!"</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;hocking! and a man &s;o totally devoid of ta&s;te! Why, would you believe it, Segnor? when I attempted to pacify him, he cur&s;ed me for a witch, and wi&s;hed that, to puni&s;h the count, my &s;i&s;ter might become as ugly as my&s;elf! Ugly indeed! I like him for that."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Don Chri&s;toval. "Doubtle&s;s the count would have thought him&s;elf fortunate, had he been permitted to exchange the one &s;i&s;ter for the other."</P>
<P>"Oh! Chri&s;t! Segnor, you are really too polite. However, I am heartily glad that the cond&eacute; was of a different way of thinking. A mighty pretty piece of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, to be &s;ure, Elvira has made of it! Af|ter broiling and &s;tewing in the Indies for thirteen long years, her hu&s;band dies, and &s;he returns to Spain, without an hou&s;e to hide her head, or money to procure her one! This Antonia was then but an infant,
<PB N="15" REF="21">
and her only remaining child. She found that her father-in-law had married again, that he was irreconcileable to the cond&eacute;, and that his &s;econd wife had produced him a &s;on, who is reported to be a very fine young man. The old marquis refu&s;ed to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter or her child; but &s;ent her word that, on condition of never hear|ing any more of her, he would a&s;&s;ign her a &s;mall pen&s;ion, and &s;he might live in an old ca&s;tle which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Mur|cia. This had been the favourite habita|tion of his elde&s;t &s;on; but, &s;ince his flight from Spain, the old marquis could not bear the place, but let it fall to ruin and confu&s;ion.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter accepted the propo&s;al; &s;he retired to Murcia, and has remained there till within the la&s;t month."</P>
<P>"And what brings her now to Madrid?" enquired Don Lorenzo, whom admiration of the young Antonia compelled to take a lively intere&s;t in the talkative old wo|man's narration.</P>
<P>"Alas! Segnor, her father-in-law being
<PB N="16" REF="22">
lately dead, the &s;teward of his Murcian e&s;tates has refu&s;ed to pay her pen&s;ion any longer. With the de&s;ign of &s;upplicating his &s;on to renew it, &s;he is now come to Madrid; but I doubt that &s;he might have &s;aved her&s;elf the trouble. You young noblemen have always enough to do with your money, and are not very often di&s;|po&s;ed to throw it away upon old women. I advi&s;ed my &s;i&s;ter to &s;end Antonia with her petition; but &s;he would not hear of &s;uch a thing. She is &s;o ob&s;tinate! Well! &s;he will find her&s;elf the wor&s;e for not fol|lowing my coun&s;els: the girl has a good pretty face, and po&s;&s;ibly might have done much."</P>
<P>"Ah, Segnora!" interrupted Don Chri&s;|toval, counterfeiting a pa&s;&s;ionate air; "if a pretty face will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, why has not your &s;i&s;ter recour&s;e to you?"</P>

<P>"Of that, Segnora, I have not the lea&s;t doubt. But permit me to a&s;k you, Have you then any aver&s;ion to matrimony?"</P>
<P>"That is an home que&s;tion. I cannot but confe&s;s, that if an amiable cavalier was to pre&s;ent him&s;elf&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here &s;he intended to throw a tender and &s;ignificant look upon Don Chri&s;toval; but, as &s;he unluckily happened to &s;quint mo&s;t abominably, the glance fell directly upon his companion. Lorenzo took the compli|ment to him&s;elf, and an&s;wered it by a pro|found bow.</P>
<P>"May I enquire," &s;aid he, "the name of the marquis?"</P>
<P>"The marquis de las Ci&s;ternas."</P>
<P>"I know him intimately well. He is not at pre&s;ent in Madrid, but is expected here daily. He is one of the be&s;t of men;

and if the lovely Antonia will permit me to be her advocate with him, I doubt not my being able to make a favourable re|port of her cau&s;e."</P>
<P>Antonia rai&s;ed her blue eyes, and &s;ilently thanked him for the offer by a &s;mile of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s. Leonella's &s;ati&s;|faction was much more loud and audible. Indeed, as her niece was generally &s;ilent in her company, &s;he thought it incumbent upon her to talk enough for both: this &s;he managed without difficulty, for &s;he very &s;eldom found her&s;elf deficient in words.</P>
<P>"Oh, Segnor!" &s;he cried; "you will lay our whole family under the mo&s;t &s;ignal ob|ligations! I accept your offer with all po&s;|&s;ible gratitude, and return you a thou&s;and thanks for the genero&s;ity of your propo&s;al. Antonia, why do not you &s;peak, child? While the cavalier &s;ays all &s;orts of civil things to you, you &s;it like a &s;tatue, and never utter a &s;yllable of thanks, either bad, good, or indifferent!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My dear aunt, I am very &s;en&s;ible that&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25">"Fye, niece! How often have I told you, that you never &s;hould interrupt a per&s;on who is &s;peaking! When did you ever know me do &s;uch a thing? Are the&s;e your Murcian manners? Mercy on me! I &s;hall never be able to make this girl any thing like a per&s;on of good breeding. But pray, Segnor," &s;he continued, addre&s;|&s;ing her&s;elf to Don Chri&s;toval, "inform me, why &s;uch a crowd is a&s;&s;embled to-day in this cathedral."</P>
<P>"Can you po&s;&s;ibly be ignorant, that Ambro&s;io, abbot of this mona&s;tery, pro|nounces a &s;ermon in this church every Thur&s;day? All Madrid rings with his prai&s;es. As yet he has preached but thrice; but all who have heard him are &s;o delight|ed with his eloquence, that it is as difficult to obtain a place at church, as at the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of a new comedy. His fame certainly mu&s;t have reached your ears?"</P>
<P>"Alas! Segnor, till ye&s;terday I never had the good fortune to &s;ee Madrid; and at Cordova we are &s;o little informed of
<PB N="20" REF="26">
what is pa&s;&s;ing in the re&s;t of the world, that the name of Ambro&s;io has never been mentioned in its precincts."</P>
<P>"You will find it in every one's mouth at Madrid. He &s;eems to have fa&s;cinated the inhabitants; and, not having attended his &s;ermons my&s;elf, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the enthu&s;ia&s;m which he has excited. The adoration paid him both by young and old, by man and woman, is unexampled. The grandees load him with pre&s;ents; their wives refu&s;e to have any other con|fe&s;&s;or; and he is known through all the city by the name of The Man of Holine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, Segnor, he is of no|ble origin?"</P>
<P>"That point &s;till remains undecided. The late &s;uperior of the Capuchins found him while yet an infant at the abbey-door. All attempts to di&s;cover who had left him there were vain, and the child him&s;elf could give no account of his parents. He was educated in the mona&s;tery, where he has remained ever &s;ince. He early &s;howed a
<PB N="21" REF="27">
&s;trong inclination for &s;tudy and retirement; and as &s;oon as he was of a proper age, he pronounced his vows. No one has ever appeared to claim him, or clear up the my&s;tery which conceals his birth; and the monks, who find their account in the fa|vour which is &s;hewn to their e&s;tabli&s;hment from re&s;pect to him, have not he&s;itated to publi&s;h, that he is a pre&s;ent to them from the Virgin. In truth, the &s;ingular au&s;terity of his life gives &s;ome countenance to the report. He is now thirty years old, every hour of which period has been pa&s;&s;ed in &s;tudy, total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, and mortification of the fle&s;h. Till the&s;e la&s;t three weeks, when he was cho&s;en &s;uperior of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, he had never been on the out&s;ide of the abbey-walls. Even now he never quits them except on Thur&s;days, when he delivers a di&s;cour&s;e in this cathedral, which all Madrid a&s;&s;em|bles to hear. His knowledge is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t profound, his eloquence the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive. In the whole cour&s;e of his life
<PB N="22" REF="28">
he has never been known to tran&s;gre&s;s a &s;ingle rule of his order; the &s;malle&s;t &s;tain is not to be di&s;covered upon his character; and he is reported to be &s;o &s;trict an ob&s;erver of cha&s;tity, that he knows not in what con|&s;i&s;ts the difference of man and woman. The common people therefore e&s;teem him to be a &s;aint."</P>
<P>"Does that make a &s;aint?" enquired Antonia. "Ble&s;s me! then am I one."</P>
<P>"Holy St. Barbara!" exclaimed Leo|nella, "what a que&s;tion! Fye, child, fye! the&s;e are not fit &s;ubjects for young wo|men to handle. You &s;hould not &s;eem to remember that there is &s;uch a thing as a man in the world, and you ought to ima|gine every body to be of the &s;ame &s;ex with your&s;elf. I &s;hould like to &s;ee you give people to under&s;tand, that you know that a man has no brea&s;ts, and no hips, and no&mdash;"</P>
<P>Luckily for Antonia's ignorance, which her aunt's lecture would &s;oon have di&s;|pelled, an univer&s;al murmur through the
<PB N="23" REF="29">
church announced the preacher's arrival. Donna Leonella ro&s;e from her &s;eat to take a better view of him, and Antonia followed her example.</P>
<P>He was a man of noble port and com|manding pre&s;ence. His &s;tature was lofty, and his features uncommonly hand&s;ome. His no&s;e was aquiline, his eyes large, black and &s;parkling, and his dark brows almo&s;t joined together. His complexion was of a deep but clear brown; &s;tudy and watch|ing had entirely deprived his cheek of colour. Tranquillity reigned upon his &s;mooth unwrinkled forehead; and content, expre&s;&s;ed upon every feature, &s;eemed to announce the man equally unacquainted with cares and crimes. He bowed him|&s;elf with humility to the audience. Still there was a certain &s;everity in his look and manner that in&s;pired univer&s;al awe, and few could &s;u&s;tain the glance of his eye, at once fiery and penetrating. Such was Am|bro&s;io, abbot of the Capuchins, and &s;ur|named "The Man of Holine&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30">Antonia, while &s;he gazed upon him eagerly, felt a plea&s;ure fluttering in her bo|&s;om which till then had been unknown to her, and for which &s;he in vain endeavoured to account. She waited with impatience till the &s;ermon &s;hould begin; and when at length the friar &s;poke, the &s;ound of his voice &s;eemed to penetrate into her very &s;oul. Though no other of the &s;pectators felt &s;uch violent &s;en&s;ations as did the young Antonia, yet every one li&s;tened with in|tere&s;t and emotion. They who were in&s;en|&s;ible to religion's merits, were &s;till enchant|ed with Ambro&s;io's oratory. All found their attention irre&s;i&s;tibly attracted while he &s;poke, and the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence reign|ed through the crowded ai&s;les. Even Lorenzo could not re&s;i&s;t the charm: he forgot that Antonia was &s;eated near him, and li&s;tened to the preacher with undivided attention.</P>
<P>In language nervous, clear, and &s;imple, the monk expatiated on the beauties of reli|gion. He explained &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e parts of the
<PB N="25" REF="31">
&s;acred writings in a &s;tyle that carried with it univer&s;al conviction. His voice, at once di&s;tinct and deep, was fraught with all the terrors of the tempe&s;t, while he inveighed again&s;t the vices of humanity, and de|&s;cribed the puni&s;hments re&s;erved for them in a future &s;tate. Every hearer looked back upon his pa&s;t offences, and trembled: the thunder &s;eemed to roll, who&s;e bolt was de&s;tined to cru&s;h him, and the aby&s;s of eternal de&s;truction to open before his feet! But when Ambro&s;io, changing his theme, &s;poke of the excellence of an un&s;ullied con&s;cience, of the glorious pro&s;pect which eternity pre&s;ented to the &s;oul untainted with reproach, and of the recompen&s;e which awaited it in the regions of everla&s;t|ing glory, his auditors felt their &s;cattered &s;pirits in&s;en&s;ibly return. They threw them|&s;elves with confidence upon the mercy of their judge; they hung with delight up|on the con&s;oling words of the preacher; and while his full voice &s;welled into me|lody, they were tran&s;ported to tho&s;e happy
<PB N="26" REF="32">
regions which he painted to their imagi|nations in colours &s;o brilliant and glow|ing.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e was of con&s;iderable length: yet, when it concluded, the audience grieved that it had not la&s;ted longer. Though the monk had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;i|lence &s;till prevailed through the church. At length the charm gradually di&s;&s;olving, the general admiration was expre&s;&s;ed in audible terms. As Ambro&s;io de&s;cended from the pulpit, his auditors crowded round him, loaded him with ble&s;&s;ings, threw them&s;elves at his feet, and ki&s;&s;ed the hem of his garment. He pa&s;&s;ed on &s;lowly, with his hands cro&s;&s;ed devoutly upon his bo&s;om, to the door opening into the abbey-chapel, at which his monks waited to receive him. He a&s;cended the &s;teps, and then, turning towards his followers, addre&s;&s;ed to them a few words of gratitude and exhortation. While he &s;poke, his ro&s;ary, compo&s;ed of large grains of amber, fell from his hand, and dropped among the &s;urrounding multi|tude.
<PB N="27" REF="33">
It was &s;eized eagerly, and imme|diately divided amid&s;t the &s;pectators. Who|ever became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a bead, pre&s;erved it as a &s;acred relique; and had it been the chaplet of thrice-ble&s;&s;ed St. Francis him|&s;elf, it could not have been di&s;puted with greater vivacity. The abbot, &s;miling at their eagerne&s;s, pronounced his benediction and quitted the church, while humility dwelt upon every feature. Dwelt &s;he al&s;o in his heart?</P>
<P>Antonia's eyes followed him with an|xiety. As the door clo&s;ed after him, it &s;eemed to her as &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ome one e&s;&s;ential to her happine&s;s. A tear &s;tole in &s;ilence down her cheek.</P>
<P>"He is &s;eparated from the world!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; "perhaps, I &s;hall never &s;ee him more!"</P>
<P>As &s;he wiped away the tear, Lorenzo ob&s;erved her action.</P>
<P>"Are you &s;atisfied with our orator?" &s;aid he; "or do you think that Madrid over-rates his talents?"</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">Antonia's heart was &s;o filled with admira|tion for the monk, that &s;he eagerly &s;eized the opportunity of &s;peaking of him: be|&s;ides, as &s;he now no longer con&s;idered Lo|renzo as an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, &s;he was le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed by her exce&s;&s;ive timidity.</P>
<P>"Oh! he far exceeds all my expecta|tions," an&s;wered &s;he; "till this moment I had no idea of the powers of eloquence. But when he &s;poke, his voice in&s;pired me with &s;uch intere&s;t, &s;uch e&s;teem, I might almo&s;t &s;ay &s;uch affection for him, that I am my&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at the acutene&s;s of my feelings."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;miled at the &s;trength of her expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"You are young, and ju&s;t entering into life," &s;aid he: "your heart, new to the world, and full of warmth and &s;en&s;ibility, receives its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions with eagerne&s;s. Artle&s;s your&s;elf, you &s;u&s;pect not others of deceit; and viewing the world through the medium of your own truth and innocence, you fancy all who &s;urround you to de&s;erve

<P>"Alas! Segnor," replied Antonia, "the misfortunes of my parents have al|ready placed before me but too many &s;ad examples of the perfidy of the world! Yet &s;urely in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the warmth of &s;ympathy cannot have deceived me."</P>
<P>"In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I allow that it has not. Ambro&s;io's character is per|fectly without reproach; and a man who has pa&s;&s;ed the whole of his life within the walls of a convent, cannot have found the opportunity to be guilty, even were he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the inclination. But now, when, obliged by the duties of his &s;ituation, he mu&s;t enter occa&s;ionally into the world, and be thrown into the way of temptation, it is now that it behoves him to &s;how the brilliance of his virtue. The trial is dan|gerous;
<PB N="30" REF="36">
he is ju&s;t at that period of life when the pa&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t vigorous, un|bridled, and de&s;potic; his e&s;tabli&s;hed re|putation will mark him out to &s;eduction as an illu&s;trious victim; novelty will give additional charms to the allurements of plea&s;ure; and even the talents with which nature has endowed him will contribute to his ruin, by facilitating the means of obtaining his object. Very few would re|turn victorious from a conte&s;t &s;o &s;evere."</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;urely Ambro&s;io will be one of tho&s;e few."</P>
<P>"Of that I have my&s;elf no doubt: by all accounts he is an exception to mankind in general, and envy would &s;eek in vain for a blot upon his character."</P>
<P>"Segnor, you delight me by this a&s;|&s;urance! It encourages me to indulge my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour; and you know not with what pain I &s;hould have repre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiment! Ah! deare&s;t aunt, en|treat my mother to choo&s;e him for our con|fe&s;&s;or."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37">"I entreat her?" replied Leonella; "I promi&s;e you that I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. I do not like this &s;ame Ambro&s;io in the lea&s;t; he has a look of &s;everity about him that made me tremble from head to foot.

<P>"You are right, Segnora," an&s;wered Don Chri&s;toval. "Too great &s;everity is &s;aid to be Ambro&s;io's only fault. Ex|empted him&s;elf from human failings, he is not &s;ufficiently indulgent to tho&s;e of others; and though &s;trictly ju&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted in his deci&s;ions, his government of the monks has already &s;hown &s;ome proofs of his inflexibility.

<P>"'Tis &s;ufficient. Well, Don Lorenzo, I &s;hall acquaint my &s;i&s;ter with your oblig|ing offer, and let you know the re&s;ult with all expedition. Where may I &s;end to you?"</P>
<P>"I am always to be found at the Me|dina palace."</P>
<P>"You may depend upon hearing from me. Farewell, cavaliers. Segnor Cond&eacute;, let me entreat you to moderate the exce&s;|&s;ive ardour of your pa&s;&s;ion. However, to prove that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with you, and prevent your abandoning your&s;elf to de&s;pair; receive this mark of my affection, and &s;ometimes be&s;tow a thought upon the ab&s;ent Leonella."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he extended a lean and wrinkled hand; which her &s;uppo&s;ed ad|mirer

ki&s;&s;ed with &s;uch &s;orry grace and con|&s;traint &s;o evident, that Lorenzo with dif|ficulty repre&s;&s;ed his inclination to laugh.

He bowed to her, as bidding her farewell; &s;he returned the compliment, and ha&s;tily withdrew.</P>
<P>"So, Lorenzo!" &s;aid Don Chri&s;toval as &s;oon as they were alone, "you have procured me an agreeable intrigue! To fa|vour your de&s;igns upon Antonia, I oblig|ingly make a few civil &s;peeches which mean nothing to the aunt, and at the end of an hour I find my&s;elf upon the brink of matrimony! How will you reward me for having &s;uffered &s;o grievou&s;ly for your &s;ake? What can repay me for having ki&s;|&s;ed the leathern paw of that confounded old witch? Diavolo!

<P>"From that petition I conclude, that the little Antonia has made &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ion upon you."</P>
<P>"I cannot expre&s;s to you how much I am charmed with her. Since my father's death, my uncle the duke de Medina has &s;ignified to me his wi&s;hes to &s;ee me mar|ried; I have till now eluded his hints, and refu&s;ed to under&s;tand them; but what I have &s;een this evening&mdash;"</P>

<P>"You forget, that &s;he is al&s;o the grand-daughter of the late marquis de las Ci&s;ter|nas; but without di&s;puting about birth and titles, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, that I never be|held a woman &s;o intere&s;ting as Antonia."</P>
<P>"Very po&s;&s;ibly; but you cannot mean to marry her?"</P>
<P>"Why not, my dear cond&eacute;? I &s;hall have wealth enough for both of us, and you know that my uncle thinks liberally upon the &s;ubject. From what I have &s;een of Ray|mond de las Ci&s;ternas, I am certain that he will readily acknowledge Antonia for his niece. Her birth therefore will be no objection to my offering her my hand. I &s;hould be a villain, could I think of her on any other terms than marriage; and in truth &s;he &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every quality requi&s;ite to make me happy in a wife&mdash; young, lovely, gentle, &s;en&s;ible&mdash;"</P>

<P><PB N="37" REF="43">"She did, not &s;ay much more, I mu&s;t confe&s;s&mdash;but then &s;he always &s;aid Yes or No in the right place."</P>
<P>"Did &s;he &s;o? Oh! your mo&s;t obedi|ent! That is u&s;ing a right lover's argu|ment, and I dare di&s;pute no longer with &s;o profound a ca&s;ui&s;t. Suppo&s;e we ad|journ to the comedy?"</P>
<P>"It is out of my power. I only ar|rived la&s;t night at Madrid, and have not yet had an opportunity of &s;eeing my &s;i&s;ter. You know that her convent is in this &s;treet, and I was going thither when the crowd which I &s;aw thronging into this church excited my curio&s;ity to know what was the matter. I &s;hall now pur&s;ue my fir&s;t intention, and probably pa&s;s the even|ing with my &s;i&s;ter at the parlour-grate."</P>
<P>"Your &s;i&s;ter in a convent, &s;ay you? Oh! very true, I had forgotten. And how does Donna Agnes? I am amazed, Don Lorenzo, how you could po&s;&s;ibly think of immuring &s;o charming a girl within the walls of a cloi&s;ter!"</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44">"I think of it, Don Chri&s;toval? How can you &s;u&s;pect me of &s;uch barbarity?

I u&s;ed every means in my power to induce her to change her re&s;olution; the endeavour was fruitle&s;s, and I lo&s;t a &s;i&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"The luckier fellow you: I think, Lo|renzo, you were a con&s;iderable gainer by that lo&s;s; if I remember right, Donna Agnes had a portion of ten thou&s;and pi&s;|toles, half of which reverted to your lord|&s;hip.

<P>He &s;aid, and darted out of the cathedral.</P>
<P>"How wild-brained!" &s;aid Lorenzo. "With &s;o excellent an heart, what pity that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o little &s;olidity of judg|ment!"</P>
<P>The night was now fa&s;t advancing. The lamps were not yet lighted. The faint beams of the ri&s;ing moon &s;carcely could pierce through the gothic ob&s;curity of the church. Lorenzo found him&s;elf unable to quit the &s;pot. The void left in
<PB N="40" REF="46">
his bo&s;om by Antonia's ab&s;ence, and his &s;i&s;ter's &s;acrifice which Don Chri&s;toval had ju&s;t recalled to his imagination, created that melancholy of mind, which accorded but too well with the religious gloom &s;urrounding him. He was &s;till leaning again&s;t the &s;eventh column from the pulpit. A &s;oft and cooling air breathed along the &s;olitary ai&s;les; the moon-beams darting into the church through painted windows, tinged the fretted roofs and ma&s;&s;y pillars with a thou&s;and various &s;hades of light and colours. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed around, only interrupted by the occa&s;ional clo&s;ing of doors in the adjoining abbey.</P>
<P>The calm of the hour and &s;olitude of the place contributed to nouri&s;h Lo|renzo's di&s;po&s;ition to melancholy. He threw him&s;elf upon a &s;eat which &s;tood near him, and abandoned him&s;elf to the delu&s;ions of his fancy. He thought of his union with Antonia; he thought of the ob&s;tacles which might oppo&s;e his wi&s;hes; and a thou&s;and changing vi&s;ions floated
<PB N="41" REF="47">
before his fancy, &s;ad 'tis true, but not unplea&s;ing. Sleep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole over him, and the tranquil &s;olemnity of his mind when awake, for a while continued to in|fluence his &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>He &s;till fancied him&s;elf to be in the church of the Capuchins; but it was no longer dark and &s;olitary. Multitudes of &s;ilver lamps &s;hed &s;plendour from the vault|ed roofs; accompanied by the captivating chaunt of di&s;tant chori&s;ters, the organ's melody &s;welled through the church; the altar &s;eemed decorated as for &s;ome di&s;tin|gui&s;hed fea&s;t; it was &s;urrounded by a brilliant company; and near it &s;tood Anto|nia arrayed in bridal white, and blu&s;hing with all the charms of virgin mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Half hoping, half fearing, Lorenzo gazed upon the &s;cene before him. Sud|den the door leading to the abbey unclo&s;ed; and he &s;aw, attended by a long train of monks, the preacher advance to whom he had ju&s;t li&s;tened with &s;o much admiration. He drew near Antonia.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48">"And where is the bridegroom?" &s;aid the imaginary friar.</P>
<P>Antonia &s;eemed to look round the church with anxiety. Involuntarily the youth ad|vanced a few &s;teps from his concealment. She &s;aw him; the blu&s;h of plea&s;ure glowed upon her cheek; with a graceful motion of her hand &s;he beckoned to him to advance. He di&s;obeyed not the command; he &s;lew to|wards her, and threw him&s;elf at her feet.</P>
<P>She retreated for a moment; then gazing upon him with unutterable delight, "Yes," &s;he exclaimed, "my bridegroom! my de&s;tined bridegroom!"</P>
<P>She &s;aid, and ha&s;tened to throw her&s;elf into his arms; but before he had time to receive her, an unknown ru&s;hed between them: his form was gigantic; his com|plexion was &s;warthy, his eyes fierce and terrible; his mouth breathed out volumes of fire, and on his forehead was written in legible characters&mdash;"Pride! Lu&s;t! Inhu|manity!"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;hrieked. The mon&s;ter cla&s;ped
<PB N="43" REF="49">
her in his arms, and, &s;pringing with her upon the altar, tortured her with his odious care&s;&s;es. She endeavoured in vain to e&s;cape from his embrace. Lorenzo flew to her &s;uccour; but, ere he had time to reach her, a loud bur&s;t of thunder was heard. In|&s;tantly the cathedral &s;eemed crumbling in|to pieces; the monks betook them&s;elves to &s;light, &s;hrieking fearfully; the lamps were extingui&s;hed, the altar &s;unk down, and in its place appeared an aby&s;s vomiting forth clouds of flame. Uttering a loud and terrible cry the mon&s;ter plunged into the gulph, and in his fall attempted to drag Antonia with him. He &s;trove in vain. Animated by &s;upernatural pow|ers, &s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his em|brace; but her white robe was left in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In&s;tantly a wing of brilliant &s;plendour &s;pread it&s;elf from either of Anto|nia's arms. She darted upwards, and while a&s;cending cried to Lorenzo, "Friend! we &s;hall meet above!"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment the roof of the cathe|dral
<PB N="44" REF="50">
opened; harmonious voices pealed along the vaults; and the glory into which Antonia was received, was compo&s;ed of rays of &s;uch dazzling brightne&s;s, that Lo|renzo was unable to &s;u&s;tain the gaze. His &s;ight failed, and he &s;unk upon the ground.</P>
<P>When he awoke he found him&s;elf extend|ed upon the pavement of the church: it was illuminated, and the chaunt of hymns &s;ounded from a di&s;tance. For a while Lorenzo could not per&s;uade him&s;elf that what he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed had been a dream, &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion had it made upon his fancy. A little recollection con|vinced him of its fallacy: the lamps had been lighted during his &s;leep, and the mu&s;ic which he heard was occa&s;ioned by the monks, who were celebrating their ve&s;pers in the abbey-chapel.</P>
<P>Lorenzo ro&s;e, and prepared to bend his &s;teps towards his &s;i&s;ter's convent; his mind fully occupied by the &s;ingularity of his dream. He already drew near the porch, when his attention was attracted by
<PB N="45" REF="51">
perceiving a &s;hadow moving upon the oppo|&s;ite wall. He looked curiou&s;ly round, and &s;oon de&s;cried a man wrapped up in his cloak, who &s;eemed carefully examining whether his actions were ob&s;erved. Very few peo|ple are exempt from the influence of curi|o&s;ity. The unknown &s;eemed anxious to conceal his bu&s;ine&s;s in the cathedral; and it was this very circum&s;tance which made Lorenzo wi&s;h to di&s;cover what he was about.</P>
<P>Our hero was con&s;cious that he had no right to pry into the &s;ecrets of this unknown cavalier.</P>
<P>"I will go," &s;aid Lorenzo. And Lo|renzo &s;tayed where he was.</P>
<P>The &s;hadow thrown by the column ef|fectually concealed him from the &s;tranger, who continued to advance with caution. At length he drew a letter from beneath his cloak, and ha&s;tily placed it beneath a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of St. Francis. Then re|tiring with precipitation, he concealed him|&s;elf in a part of the church at a con&s;ider|able
<PB N="46" REF="52">
di&s;tance from that in which the image &s;tood.</P>
<P>"So!" &s;aid Lorenzo to him&s;elf; "this is only &s;ome fooli&s;h love affair. I believe, I may as well be gone, for I can do no good in it."</P>
<P>In truth, till that moment it never came into his head that he could do any good in it; but he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome little excu&s;e to him&s;elf for having in|dulged his curio&s;ity. He now made a &s;econd attempt to retire from the church. For this time he gained the porch without meeting with any impediment; but it was de&s;tined that he &s;hould pay it another vi&s;it that night. As he de&s;cended the &s;teps leading into the &s;treet, a cavalier ru&s;hed again&s;t him with &s;uch violence, that both were nearly overturned by the concu&s;&s;ion. Lorenzo put his hand to his &s;word.</P>
<P>"How now, Segnor?" &s;aid he; "what mean you by this rudene&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Ha! is it you, Medina?" replied the new comer, whom Lorenzo by his voice
<PB N="47" REF="53">
now recognized for Don Chri&s;toval. "You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the luckie&s;t fellow in the univer&s;e, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have left the church before my return. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, in! my dear lad! they will be here immediately!"</P>
<P>"Who will be here?"</P>
<P>"The old hen and all her pretty little chickens. In, I &s;ay; and then you &s;hall know the whole hi&s;tory."</P>
<P>Lorenzo followed him into the cathe|dral, and they concealed them&s;elves behind the &s;tatue of St. Francis.</P>
<P>"And now," &s;aid our hero, "may I take the liberty of a&s;king what is the mean|ing of all this ha&s;te and rapture?"</P>
<P>"Oh! Lorenzo, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch a glo|rious &s;ight! The priore&s;s of St. Clare and her whole train of nuns are coming hither. You are to know, that the pious father Am|bro&s;io [the Lord reward him for it!] will up|on no account move out of his own precincts. It being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every fa|&s;hionable convent to have him for its con|fe&s;&s;or,
<PB N="48" REF="54">
the nuns are in con&s;equence obliged to vi&s;it him at the abbey; &s;ince, when the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Ma|homet mu&s;t needs go to the mountain. Now the priore&s;s of St. Clare, the better to e&s;cape the gaze of &s;uch impure eyes as belong to your&s;elf and your humble &s;ervant, thinks proper to bring her holy flock to confe&s;|&s;ion in the du&s;k: &s;he is to be admitted into the abbey-chapel by you private door. The portere&s;s of St. Clare, who is a worthy old &s;oul and a particular friend of mine, has ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured me of their being here in a few moments. There is news for you, you rogue! We &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of the prettie&s;t faces in Madrid!"</P>
<P>"In truth, Chri&s;toval, we &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. The nuns are always veiled."</P>
<P>"No! no! I know better. On entering a place of wor&s;hip, they ever take off their veils, from re&s;pect to the &s;aint to whom 'tis dedicated. But hark, they are coming! Si|lence! &s;ilence! Ob&s;erve, and be convinced."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="55">"Good!" &s;aid Lorenzo to him&s;elf; "I may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover to whom the vows are addre&s;&s;ed of this my&s;terious &s;tranger."</P>
<P>Scarcely had Don Chri&s;toval cea&s;ed to &s;peak, when the domina of St. Clare appear|ed, followed by a long proce&s;&s;ion of nuns. Each upon entering the church took off her veil. The priore&s;s cro&s;&s;ed her hands upon her bo&s;om, and made a profound re|verence as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatue of St. Fran|cis, the patron of this cathedral. The nuns followed her example, and &s;everal moved onwards without having &s;atisfied Lo|renzo's curio&s;ity. He almo&s;t began to de|&s;pair of &s;eeing the my&s;tery cleared up, when, in paying her re&s;pects to St. Francis, one of the nuns happened to drop her ro&s;ary. As &s;he &s;tooped to pick it up the light fla&s;h|ed full in her face. At the &s;ame moment &s;he dexterou&s;ly removed the letter from beneath the image, placed it in her bo&s;om, and ha&s;t|ened to re&s;ume her rank in the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Ha!" &s;aid Chri&s;toval in a low
<PB N="50" REF="56">
voice, "here we have &s;ome little in|trigue, no doubt."</P>
<P>"Agnes, by heaven!" cried Lorenzo.</P>
<P>"What, your &s;i&s;ter? Diavolo! Then &s;omebody, I &s;uppo&s;e, will have to pay for our peeping."</P>
<P>"And &s;hall pay for it without delay," replied the incen&s;ed brother.</P>
<P>The pious proce&s;&s;ion had now entered the abbey; the door was already clo&s;ed upon it. The unknown immediately quit|ted his concealment, and ha&s;tened to leave the church: ere he could effect his inten|tion, he de&s;cried Medina &s;tationed in his pa&s;&s;age. The &s;tranger ha&s;tily retreated, and drew his hat over his eyes.</P>
<P>"Attempt not to fly me!" exclaimed Lorenzo; "I will know who you are, and what were the contents of that letter."</P>
<P>"Of that letter?" repeated the unknown. "And by what title do you a&s;k the que&s;|tion?"</P>
<P>"By a title of which I am now a&s;hamed; but it becomes not you to que&s;tion me.
<PB N="51" REF="57">
Either reply circum&s;tantially to my de|mands, or an&s;wer me with your &s;word."</P>
<P>"The latter method will be the &s;horte&s;t," rejoined the other, drawing his rapier; "come on, Segnor Bravo! I am ready."</P>
<P>Burning with rage, Lorenzo ha&s;tened to the attack: the antagoni&s;ts had already exchanged &s;everal pa&s;&s;es, before Chri&s;toval, who at that moment had more &s;en&s;e than either of them, could throw him&s;elf be|tween their weapons.</P>
<P>"Hold! hold! Medina!" he exclaim|ed; "remember the con&s;equences of &s;hed|ding blood on con&s;ecrated ground!"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger immediately dropped his &s;word.</P>
<P>"Medina?" he cried. "Great God, is it po&s;&s;ible! Lorenzo, have you quite for|gotten Raymond de las Ci&s;ternas?"</P>
<P>Lorenzo's a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed with every &s;ucceeding moment. Raymond ad|vanced towards him; but with a look of &s;u&s;picion he drew back his hand, which the other was preparing to take.</P>
<P>"You here, Marquis? What is the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
meaning of all this? You engaged in a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence with my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e affections&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Have ever been, and &s;till are mine. But this is no fit place for an explanation. Accompany me to my hotel, and you &s;hall know every thing. Who is that with you?"</P>
<P>"One whom I believe you to have &s;een before," replied Don Chri&s;toval, "though probably not at church."</P>
<P>"The cond&eacute; d'O&s;&s;orio?"</P>
<P>"Exactly &s;o, marquis."</P>
<P>"I have no objection to entru&s;ting you with my &s;ecret, for I am &s;ure that I may depend upon your &s;ilence."</P>
<P>"Then your opinion of me is better than my own, and therefore I mu&s;t beg leave to decline your confidence. Do you go your own way, and I &s;hall go mine. Marquis, where are you to be found?"</P>
<P>"As u&s;ual, at the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas; but remember that I am incognito, and that, if you wi&s;h to &s;ee me, you mu&s;t a&s;k for Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59">"Good! good! Farewell, cavaliers!" &s;aid Don Chri&s;toval, and in&s;tantly de|parted.</P>
<P>"You, marquis," &s;aid Lorenzo in the accent of &s;urpri&s;e; "you, Alphon&s;o d'Al|varada?"</P>
<P>"Even &s;o, Lorenzo: but unle&s;s you have already heard my &s;tory from your &s;i&s;ter, I have much to relate that will a&s;to|ni&s;h you. Follow me, therefore, to my hotel without delay."</P>
<P>At this moment the porter of the Capu|chins entered the cathedral to lock up the doors for the night. The two noblemen in|&s;tantly withdrew, and ha&s;tened with all &s;peed to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas.</P>
<P>"Well, Antonia," &s;aid the aunt, as &s;oon as &s;he had quitted the church," what think you of our gallants? Don Lorenzo really &s;eems a very obliging good &s;ort of young man: he paid you &s;ome attention, and nobody
<PB N="54" REF="60">
knows what may come of it. But as to Don Chri&s;toval, I prote&s;t to you, he is the very phoenix of politene&s;s; &s;o gallant! &s;o well-bred! &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and &s;o pathetic! Well! if ever man can prevail upon me to break my vow never to marry, it will be that Don Chri&s;toval. You &s;ee, niece, that every thing turns out exactly as I told you: the very moment that I produced my&s;elf in Madrid, I knew that I &s;hould be &s;urround|ed by admirers. When I took off my veil, did you &s;ee, Antonia, what an effect the action had upon the cond&eacute;? And when I pre&s;ented him my hand, did you ob&s;erve the air of pa&s;&s;ion with which he ki&s;&s;ed it? If ever I witne&s;&s;ed real love, I then &s;aw it impre&s;&s;ed upon Don Chri&s;toval's counte|nance!"</P>
<P>Now Antonia had ob&s;erved the air with which Don Chri&s;toval had ki&s;&s;ed this &s;ame hand; but as &s;he drew conclu&s;ions from it &s;omewhat different from her aunt's, &s;he was wi&s;e enough to hold her tongue. As this is the only in&s;tance known of a wo|man's
<PB N="55" REF="61">
ever having done &s;o, it was judged worthy to be recorded here.</P>
<P>The old lady continued her di&s;cour&s;e to Antonia in the &s;ame &s;train, till they gained the &s;treet in which was their lodg|ing. Here a crowd collected before their door permitted them not to approach it; and placing them&s;elves on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet, they endeavoured to make out what had drawn all the&s;e people together. After &s;ome minutes the crowd formed it&s;elf into a circle; and now An|tonia perceived in the mid&s;t of it a woman of extraordinary height, who whirled her|&s;elf repeatedly round and round, u&s;ing all &s;orts of extravagant ge&s;tures. Her dre&s;s was compo&s;ed of &s;hreds of various-coloured &s;ilks and linens fanta&s;tically arranged, yet not entirely without ta&s;te. Her head was covered with a kind of turban ornamented with vine-leaves and wild flowers. She &s;eemed much &s;un-burnt, and her com|plexion was of a deep olive: her eyes look|ed fiery and &s;trange; and in her hand &s;he
<PB N="56" REF="62">
bore a long black rod, with which &s;he at intervals traced a variety of &s;ingular figures upon the ground, round about which &s;he danced in all the eccentric attitudes of folly and delirium. Suddenly &s;he broke off her dance, whirled her&s;elf round thrice with rapidity, and after a moment's pau&s;e &s;he &s;ung the following ballad:

<P>THE monks having attended their ab|bot to the door of his cell, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with an air of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, in which humility's &s;emblance combated with the reality of pride.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner alone, than he gave free loo&s;e to the indulgence of his vanity.
<PB N="64" REF="70">
When he remembered the enthu&s;ia&s;m which his di&s;cour&s;e had excited, his heart &s;welled with rapture, and his imagination pre&s;ent|ed him with &s;plendid vi&s;ions of aggrandize|ment. He looked round him with exul|tation; and pride told him loudly, that he was &s;uperior to the re&s;t of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>"Who," thought he, "who but my|&s;elf has pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of youth, yet &s;ees no &s;ingle &s;tain upon his con&s;cience? Who el&s;e has &s;ubdued the violence of &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ions and an impetuous temperament, and &s;ubmitted even from the dawn of life to voluntary retirement? I &s;eek for &s;uch a man in vain. I &s;ee no one but my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch re&s;olution. Religion can|not boa&s;t Ambro&s;io's equal! How power|ful an effect did my di&s;cour&s;e produce up|on its auditors! How they crowded round me! How they loaded me with benedic|tions, and pronounced me the &s;ole uncor|rupted pillar of the church! What then now is left for me to do? Nothing, but to
<PB N="65" REF="71">
watch as carefully over the conduct of my brethren, as I have hitherto watched over my own. Yet hold! May I not be tempt|ed from tho&s;e paths, which till now I have pur&s;ued without one moment's wandering? Am I not a man, who&s;e nature is frail and prone to error? I mu&s;t now abandon the &s;olitude of my retreat; the faire&s;t and no|ble&s;t dames of Madrid continually pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the abbey, and will u&s;e no other confe&s;&s;or. I mu&s;t accu&s;tom my eyes to objects of temptation, and expo&s;e my|&s;elf to the &s;eduction of luxury and de&s;ire. Should I meet in that world which I am con&s;trained to enter, &s;ome lovely female&mdash; lovely as you&mdash;Madona&mdash;!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he fixed his eyes upon a picture of the Virgin, which was &s;u&s;|pended oppo&s;ite to him: this for two years had been the object of his increa&s;ing won|der and adoration. He pau&s;ed, and gazed upon it with delight.</P>
<P>"What beauty in that countenance!" he continued after a &s;ilence of &s;ome mi|nutes;
<PB N="66" REF="72">
"how graceful is the turn of that head! what &s;weetne&s;s, yet what maje&s;ty in her divine eyes! how &s;oftly her cheek reclines upon her hand! Can the ro&s;e vie with the blu&s;h of that cheek? can the lily rival the whitene&s;s of that hand? Oh! if &s;uch a creature exi&s;ted, and exi&s;ted but for me! were I permitted to twine round my fingers tho&s;e golden ringlets, and pre&s;s with my lips the trea&s;ures of that &s;nowy bo&s;om! gracious God, &s;hould I then re&s;i&s;t the temptation? Should I not barter for a &s;ingle embrace the reward of my &s;ufferings for thirty years? Should I not abandon&mdash;Fool that I am! Whi|ther do I &s;uffer my admiration of this picture to hurry me? Away, impure ideas! Let me remember, that woman is for ever lo&s;t to me. Never was mortal formed &s;o perfect as this picture. But even did &s;uch exi&s;t, the trial might be too mighty for a common virtue; but Ambro&s;io's is proof again&s;t temptation. Temptation, did I &s;ay? To me it would be none. What
<PB N="67" REF="73">
charms me, when ideal and con&s;idered as a &s;uperior being, would di&s;gu&s;t me, be|come woman and tainted with all the fail|ings of mortality. It is not the woman's beauty that fills me with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;m: it is the painter's &s;kill that I admire; it is the Divinity that I adore. Are not the pa&s;|&s;ions dead in my bo&s;om? have I not freed my&s;elf from the frailty of mankind? Fear not, Ambro&s;io! Take confidence in the &s;trength of your virtue. Enter boldly in|to the world, to who&s;e failings you are &s;u|perior; reflect that you are now exempted from humanity's defects, and defy all the arts of the &s;pirits of darkne&s;s. They &s;hall know you for what you are!"</P>
<P>Here his reverie was interrupted by three &s;oft knocks at the door of his cell. With difficulty did the abbot awake from his delirium. The knocking was repeated.</P>
<P>"Who is there?" &s;aid Ambro&s;io at length.</P>
<P>"It is only Ro&s;ario," replied a gentle voice.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="74">"Enter! enter, my &s;on!"</P>
<P>The door was immediately opened, and Ro&s;ario appeared with a &s;mall ba&s;ket in his hand.</P>
<P>Ro&s;ario was a young novice belonging to the mona&s;tery, who in three months in|tended to make his profe&s;&s;ion. A &s;ort of my&s;tery enveloped this youth, which ren|dered him at once an object of intere&s;t and curio&s;ity. His hatred of &s;ociety, his pro|found melancholy, his rigid ob&s;ervation of the duties of his order, and his volun|tary &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, at his age &s;o unu&s;ual, attracted the notice of the whole fraternity. He &s;eemed fearful of being re|cogni&s;ed, and no one had ever &s;een his face. His head was continually muffled up in his cowl; yet &s;uch of his features as acci|dent di&s;covered, appeared the mo&s;t beauti|ful and noble. Ro&s;ario was the only name by which he was known in the mona&s;tery. No one knew from whence he came, and when que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject he pre&s;erved a profound &s;ilence. A &s;tranger, who&s;e rich
<PB N="69" REF="75">
habit and magnificent equipage declared him to be of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, had en|gaged the monks to receive a novice, and had depo&s;ited the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums. The next day he returned with Ro&s;ario, and from that time no more had been heard of him.</P>
<P>The youth had carefully avoided the company of the monks: he an&s;wered their civilities with &s;weetne&s;s, but re&s;erve, and evidently &s;howed that his inclination led him to &s;olitude. To this general rule the &s;uperior was the only exception. To him he looked up with a re&s;pect approaching idolatry: he &s;ought his company with the mo&s;t attentive a&s;&s;iduity, and eagerly &s;eized every means to ingratiate him&s;elf in his favour. In the abbot's &s;ociety his heart &s;eemed to be at ea&s;e, and an air of gaiety pervaded his whole manners and di&s;cour&s;e. Ambro&s;io on his &s;ide did not feel le&s;s at|tracted towards the youth; with him alone did he lay a&s;ide his habitual &s;everity. When he &s;poke to him, he in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;|&s;umed
<PB N="70" REF="76">
a tone milder than was u&s;ual to him; and no voice &s;ounded &s;o &s;weet to him as did Ro&s;ario's. He repaid the youth's attentions by in&s;tructing him in various &s;ciences; the novice received his le&s;&s;ons with docility; Ambro&s;io was every day more charmed with the vivacity of his genius, the &s;implicity of his manners, and the rectitude of his heart: in &s;hort, he loved him with all the affection of a father. He could not help &s;ometimes indulging a de|&s;ire &s;ecretly to &s;ee the face of his pupil; but his rule of &s;elf-denial extended even to curio&s;ity, and prevented him from com|municating his wi&s;hes to the youth.</P>
<P>"Pardon my intru&s;ion, father," &s;aid Ro&s;ario, while he placed his ba&s;ket upon the table; "I come to you a &s;uppliant. Hearing that a dear friend is dangerou&s;ly ill, I entreat your prayers for his recovery. If &s;upplications can prevail upon heaven to &s;pare him, &s;urely yours mu&s;t be effi|cacious."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">Whatever depends upon me, my &s;on, you know that you may command. What is your friend's name?"</P>
<P>"Vincentio della Ronda."</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;ufficient. I will not forget him in my prayers, and may our thrice-ble&s;&s;ed St. Francis deign to li&s;ten to my interce&s;|&s;ion!&mdash;What have you in your ba&s;ket, Ro&s;ario?"</P>
<P>"A few of tho&s;e flowers, reverend fa|ther, which I have ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t acceptable to you. Will you permit my arranging them in your chamber?"</P>
<P>"Your attentions charm me, my &s;on."</P>
<P>While Ro&s;ario di&s;per&s;ed the contents of his ba&s;ket in &s;mall va&s;es, placed for that purpo&s;e in various parts of the room, the abbot thus continued the conver&s;ation:</P>
<P>"I &s;aw you not in the church this even|ing, Ro&s;ario."</P>
<P>"Yet I was pre&s;ent, father. I am too grateful for your protection to lo&s;e an op|portunity of witne&s;&s;ing your triumph."</P>
<P>"Alas! Ro&s;ario, I have but little cau&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="78">
to triumph: the &s;aint &s;poke by my mouth; to him belongs all the merit. It &s;eems then you were contented with my di&s;|cour&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Contented, &s;ay you? Oh! you &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed your&s;elf! Never did I hear &s;uch eloquence&mdash;&s;ave once!"</P>
<P>Here the novice heaved an involuntary &s;igh.</P>
<P>"When was that once?" demanded the abbot.</P>
<P>"When you preached upon the &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition of our late &s;uperior."</P>
<P>"I remember it: that is more than two years ago. And were you pre&s;ent? I knew you not at that time, Ro&s;ario."</P>
<P>"'Tis true, father; and would to God I had expired ere I beheld that day! What &s;ufferings, what &s;orrows &s;hould I have e&s;caped!"</P>
<P>"Sufferings at your age, Ro&s;ario?"</P>
<P>"Aye, father; &s;ufferings, which if known to you, would equally rai&s;e your anger and compa&s;&s;ion! Sufferings, which
<PB N="73" REF="79">
form at once the torment and plea&s;ure of my exi&s;tence! Yet in this retreat my bo|&s;om would feel tranquil, were it not for the tortures of apprehen&s;ion. Oh God! oh God! how cruel is a life of fear!&mdash; Father! I have given up all; I have abandoned the world and its delights for ever: nothing now remains, nothing now has charms for me, but your friend&s;hip, but your affection. If I lo&s;e that, father! oh! if I lo&s;e that, tremble at the effects of my de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>"You apprehend the lo&s;s of my friend|&s;hip? How has my conduct ju&s;tified this fear? Know me better, Ro&s;ario, and think me worthy of your confidence. What are your &s;ufferings? Reveal them to me, and believe, that if 'tis in my power to re|lieve them&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah! 'tis in no one's power but yours. Yet I mu&s;t not let you know them. You would hate me for my avowal! you would drive me from your pre&s;ence with &s;corn and ignominy."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80">"My &s;on, I conjure you! I entreat you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"For pity's &s;ake, enquire no further! I mu&s;t not&mdash;I dare not&mdash;Hark! the bell rings for ve&s;pers! Father, your benedic|tion, and I leave you."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he threw him&s;elf upon his knees, and received the ble&s;&s;ing which he demanded. Then pre&s;&s;ing the abbot's hand to his lips, he &s;tarted from the ground, and ha&s;tily quitted the apartment. Soon after Ambro&s;io de&s;cended to ve&s;pers (which were celebrated in a &s;mall chapel belong|ing to the abbey), filled with &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ingularity of the youth's behaviour.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pers being over, the monks retired to their re&s;pective cells. The abbot alone remained in the chapel to receive the nuns of St. Clare. He had not been long &s;eated in the confe&s;&s;ional chair, before the priore&s;s made her appearance. Each of the nuns was heard in her turn, while the others waited with the domina in the adjoining ve&s;try. Ambro&s;io li&s;tened to the confe&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="75" REF="81">
with attention, made many exhorta|tions, enjoined penance proportioned to each offence, and for &s;ome time every thing went on as u&s;ual: till at la&s;t one of the nuns, con&s;picuous from the noblene&s;s of her air and elegance of her figure, care|le&s;sly permitted a letter to fall from her bo&s;om. She was retiring, uncon&s;cious of her lo&s;s. Ambro&s;io &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been written by &s;ome one of her relations, and picked it up, intending to re&s;tore it to her.</P>
<P>"Stay, daughter," &s;aid he; "you have let fall&mdash;"</P>
<P>At this moment, the paper being already open, his eye involuntarily read the fir&s;t words. He &s;tarted back with &s;urpri&s;e. The nun had turned round on hearing his voice: the perceived her letter in his hand, and, uttering a &s;hriek of terror, flew ha&s;tily to regain it.</P>
<P>"Hold!" &s;aid the friar in a tone of &s;everity; "daughter, I mu&s;t read this let|ter."</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82">"Then I am lo&s;t!" &s;he exclaimed, cla&s;ping her hands together wildly.</P>
<P>All colour in&s;tantly faded from her face; &s;he trembled with agitation, and was obliged to fold her arms round a pillar of the chapel to &s;ave her&s;elf from &s;inking upon the floor. In the mean while the abbot read the following lines:</P>
<P>"All is ready for your e&s;cape, my dear|e&s;t Agnes! At twelve to-morrow night I &s;hall expect to find you at the garden-door: I have obtained the key, and a few hours will &s;uffice to place you in a &s;ecure a&s;ylum. Let no mi&s;taken &s;cruples induce you to reject the certain means of pre&s;erv|ing your&s;elf and the innocent creature whom you nouri&s;h in your bo&s;om. Re|member that you had promi&s;ed to be mine, long ere you engaged your&s;elf to the church; that your &s;ituation will &s;oon be evident to the prying eyes of your com|panions; and that flight is the only means of avoiding the effects of their malevolent
<PB N="77" REF="83">
re&s;entment. Farewell, my Agnes! my dear and de&s;tined wife! Fail not to be at the garden-door at twelve!"</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed, Ambro&s;io bent an eye &s;tern and angry upon the im|prudent nun.</P>
<P>"This letter mu&s;t to the priore&s;s," &s;aid he, and pa&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>His words &s;ounded like thunder to her ears: &s;he awoke from her torpidity only to be &s;en&s;ible of the dangers of her &s;itua|tion. She followed him ha&s;tily, and de|tained him by his garment.</P>
<P>"Stay! oh! &s;tay!" &s;he cried in the accents of de&s;pair, while &s;he threw her&s;elf at the friar's feet, and bathed them with her tears. "Father, compa&s;&s;ionate my youth! Look with indulgence on a wo|man's weakne&s;s, and deign to conceal my frailty! The remainder of my life &s;hall be employed in expiating this &s;ingle fault, and your lenity will bring back a &s;oul to heaven!"</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84">"Amazing confidence! What! &s;hall St. Clare's convent become the retreat of pro&s;titutes? Shall I &s;uffer the church of Chri&s;t to cheri&s;h in its bo&s;om debauchery and &s;hame? Unworthy wretch! &s;uch le|nity would make me your accomplice. Mercy would here be criminal. You have abandoned your&s;elf to a &s;educer's lu&s;t; you have defiled the &s;acred habit by your impurity; and &s;till dare you think your|&s;elf de&s;erving my compa&s;&s;ion? Hence, nor detain me longer. Where is the lady priore&s;s?" he added, rai&s;ing his voice.</P>
<P>"Hold! father, hold! Hear me but for one moment! Tax me not with im|purity, nor think that I have erred from the warmth of temperament. Long before I took the veil, Raymond was ma&s;ter of my heart: he in&s;pired me with the pure&s;t, the mo&s;t irreproachable pa&s;&s;ion, and was on the point of becoming my lawful hu&s;|band. An horrible adventure, and the treachery of a relation, &s;eparated us from each other. I believed him for ever lo&s;t to
<PB N="79" REF="85">
me, and threw my&s;elf into a convent from motives of de&s;pair. Accident again united us; I could not refu&s;e my&s;elf the melan|choly plea&s;ure of mingling my tears with his. We met nightly in the gardens of St. Clare, and in an unguarded moment I violated my vows of cha&s;tity. I &s;hall &s;oon become a mother. Reverend Ambro&s;io, take com|pa&s;&s;ion on me; take compa&s;&s;ion on the in|nocent being who&s;e exi&s;tence is attached to mine. If you di&s;cover my imprudence to the domina, both of us are lo&s;t. The puni&s;hment which the laws of St. Clare a&s;&s;ign to unfortunates like my&s;elf, is mo&s;t &s;evere and cruel. Worthy, worthy father! let not your own untainted con|&s;cience render you unfeeling towards tho&s;e le&s;s able to with&s;tand temptation! Let not mercy be the only virtue of which your heart is un&s;u&s;ceptible! Pity me, mo&s;t re|verend! Re&s;tore my letter, nor doom me to inevitable de&s;truction!"</P>
<P>"Your boldne&s;s confounds me. Shall <HI>I</HI> conceal your crime&mdash;<HI>I</HI> whom you have
<PB N="80" REF="86">
deceived by your feigned confe&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No, daughter, no. I will render you a more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. I will re&s;cue you from perdition, in &s;pite of your&s;elf. Penance and mortification &s;hall expiate your offence, and &s;everity force you back to the paths of ho|line&s;s. What, ho! Mother St. Agatha!"</P>
<P>"Father! by all that is &s;acred, by all that is mo&s;t dear to you, I &s;upplicate, I entreat&mdash;&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Relea&s;e me. I will not hear you. Where is the domina? Mother St. Agatha, where are you?"</P>
<P>The door of the ve&s;try opened, and the priore&s;s entered the chapel, followed by her nuns.</P>
<P>"Cruel, cruel!" exclaimed Agnes, re|linqui&s;hing her hold.</P>
<P>Wild and de&s;perate, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the ground, beating her bo&s;om, and rending her veil in all the delirium of de|&s;pair. The nuns gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment upon the &s;cene before them. The friar now pre&s;ented the fatal paper to the priore&s;s,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
informed her of the manner in which he had found it, and added, that it was her bu&s;ine&s;s to decide what penance the de|linquent merited.</P>
<P>While &s;he peru&s;ed the letter, the domina's countenance grew inflamed with pa&s;&s;ion. What! &s;uch a crime committed in her con|vent, and made known to Ambro&s;io, to the idol of Madrid, to the man whom &s;he was mo&s;t anxious to impre&s;s with the opinion of the &s;trictne&s;s and regularity of her hou&s;e! Words were inadequate to expre&s;s her fury. She was &s;ilent, and darted upon the pro&s;trate nun looks of menace and malig|nity.</P>
<P>"Away with her to the convent!" &s;aid &s;he at length to &s;ome of her attendants.</P>
<P>Two of the olde&s;t nuns now approach|ing Agnes, rai&s;ed her forcibly from the ground, and prepared to conduct her from the chapel.</P>
<P>"What!" &s;he exclaimed &s;uddenly, &s;hak|ing off their hold with di&s;tracted ge&s;tures, "is all hope then lo&s;t? Already do you
<PB N="82" REF="88">
drag me to puni&s;hment? Where are you, Raymond? Oh! &s;ave me! &s;ave me!" Then ca&s;ting upon the abbot a frantic look, "Hear me!" &s;he continued, "man of an hard heart! Hear me, proud, &s;tern, and cruel! You could have &s;aved me; you could have re&s;tored me to happine&s;s and virtue, but would not; you are the de|&s;troyer of my &s;oul; you are my murderer, and on you fall the cur&s;e of my death and my unborn infant's! In&s;olent in your yet-un&s;haken virtue, you di&s;dained the prayers of a penitent; but God will &s;hew mercy, though you &s;hew none. And where is the merit of your boa&s;ted virtue? What temp|tations have you vanqui&s;hed? Coward! you have fled from it, not oppo&s;ed &s;e|duction. But the day of trial will arrive. Oh! then when you yield to impetuous pa&s;&s;ions; when you feel that man is weak, and born to err; when, &s;huddering, you look back upon your crimes, and &s;olicit, with terror, the mercy of your God, oh! in that fearful moment think upon me!
<PB N="83" REF="89">
think upon your cruelty! think upon Agnes, and de&s;pair of pardon."</P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, her &s;trength was exhau&s;ted, and &s;he &s;unk inani|mate upon the bo&s;om of a nun who &s;tood near her. She was immediately conveyed from the chapel, and her companions fol|lowed her.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io had not li&s;tened to her re|proaches without emotion. A &s;ecret pang at his heart made him feel that he had treated this unfortunate with too great &s;e|verity. He therefore detained the priore&s;s, and ventured to pronounce &s;ome words in favour of the delinquent.</P>
<P>"The violence of her de&s;pair," &s;aid he, "proves that at lea&s;t vice is not become familiar to her. Perhaps, by treating her with &s;omewhat le&s;s rigour than is generally practi&s;ed, and mitigating in &s;ome degree the accu&s;tomed penance&mdash;&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mitigate it, father?" interrupted the lady priore&s;s: "Not I, believe me. The laws of our order are &s;trict and &s;evere;
<PB N="84" REF="90">
they have fallen into di&s;u&s;e of late; but the crime of Agnes &s;hews me the nece&s;&s;ity of their revival. I go to &s;ignify my inten|tion to the convent, and Agnes &s;hall be the fir&s;t to feel the rigour of tho&s;e laws, which &s;hall be obeyed to the very letter. Father, farewell!"</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he ha&s;tened out of the chapel.</P>
<P>"I have done my duty," &s;aid Ambro&s;io to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Still did he not feel perfectly &s;atisfied by this reflection. To di&s;&s;ipate the unplea&s;ant ideas which this &s;cene had excited in him, upon quitting the chapel he de&s;cended into the abbey-garden. In all Madrid there was no &s;pot more beautiful, or better regulated. It was laid out with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ta&s;te; the choice&s;t flowers adorned it in the height of luxuriance, and, though artfully arranged, &s;eemed only planted by the hand of Nature. Fountains, &s;pring|ing from ba&s;ons of white marble, cooled the air with perpetual &s;howers; and the
<PB N="85" REF="91">
walls were entirely covered by je&s;&s;amine, vines, and honey-&s;uckles. The hour now added to the beauty of the &s;cene. The full moon, ranging through a blue and cloudle&s;s &s;ky, &s;hed upon the trees a trem|bling lu&s;tre, and the waters of the fountains &s;parkled in the &s;ilver beam; a gentle breeze breathed the fragrance of orange-blo&s;&s;oms along the alleys, and the nightingale poured forth her melodious murmur from the &s;hel|ter of an artificial wilderne&s;s. Thither the abbot bent his &s;teps.</P>
<P>In the bo&s;om of this little grove &s;tood a ru&s;tic grotto, formed in imitation of an hermitage. The walls were con&s;tructed of roots of trees, and the inter&s;tices filled up with mo&s;s and ivy. Seats of turf were placed on either &s;ide, and a natural ca&s;cade fell from the rock above. Buried in him|&s;elf, the monk approached the &s;pot. The univer&s;al calm had communicated it&s;elf to his bo&s;om, and a voluptuous tranquillity &s;pread languor through his &s;oul.</P>
<P>He reached the hermitage, and was en|tering
<PB N="86" REF="92">
to repo&s;e him&s;elf, when he &s;topped on perceiving it to be already occupied. Extended upon one of the banks lay a man in a melancholy po&s;ture. His head was &s;upported upon his arm, and he &s;eemed lo&s;t in meditation. The monk drew nearer, and recogni&s;ed Ro&s;ario: he watched him in &s;ilence, and entered not the hermitage. After &s;ome minutes the youth rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixed them mournfully upon the oppo&s;ite wall.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid he, with a deep and plaint|ive &s;igh, "I feel all the happine&s;s of thy &s;ituation, all the mi&s;ery of my own. Happy were I, could I think like thee! Could I look like thee with di&s;gu&s;t upon mankind, could bury my&s;elf for ever in &s;ome impe|netrable &s;olitude, and forget that the world holds beings de&s;erving to be loved! O God! what a ble&s;&s;ing would mi&s;anthropy be to me!"</P>
<P>"That is a &s;ingular thought, Ro&s;ario," &s;aid the abbot, entering the grotto.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="93">"You here, reverend father?" cried the novice.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time &s;tarting from his place in confu&s;ion, he drew his cowl ha&s;tily over his face. Ambro&s;io &s;eated him&s;elf upon the bank, and obliged the youth to place him&s;elf by him.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not indulge this di&s;po&s;ition to melancholy," &s;aid he: "What can po&s;|&s;ibly have made you view in &s;o de&s;irable a light, mi&s;anthropy, of all &s;entiments the mo&s;t hateful?"</P>
<P>"The peru&s;al of the&s;e ver&s;es, father, which till now had e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation. The brightne&s;s of the moon-beams permitted my reading them; and, oh! how I envy the feelings of the writer!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he pointed to a marble tablet fixed again&s;t the oppo&s;ite wall: on it were engraved the following lines:

<P>"Were it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid the friar, "for man to be &s;o totally wrapped up in him|&s;elf as to live in ab&s;olute &s;eclu&s;ion from human nature, and could yet feel the con|tented tranquillity which the&s;e lines ex|pre&s;s, I allow that the &s;ituation would be more de&s;irable, than to live in a world &s;o
<PB N="90" REF="96">
pregnant with every vice and every folly. But this never can be the ca&s;e. This in|&s;cription was merely placed here for the ornament of the grotto, and the &s;entiments and the hermit are equally imaginary. Man was born for &s;ociety. However little he may be attached to the world, he never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Di&s;gu&s;ted at the guilt or ab&s;urdity of mankind, the mi&s;anthrope flies from it; he re&s;olves to become an hermit, and buries him&s;elf in the cavern of &s;ome gloomy rock. While hate inflames his bo&s;om, po&s;&s;ibly he may feel contented with his &s;ituation: but when his pa&s;&s;ions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his &s;or|rows, and healed tho&s;e wounds which he bore with him to his &s;olitude, think you that Content becomes his companion? Ah! no, Ro&s;ario. No longer &s;u&s;tained by the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions, he feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of ennui and wea|rine&s;s. He looks round, and finds him&s;elf
<PB N="91" REF="97">
alone in the univer&s;e: the love of &s;ociety <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evives in his bo&s;om, and he pants to re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn to that world which he has abandoned. Nature lo&s;es all her charms in his eyes: no one is near him to point out her beauties, or &s;hare in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of &s;ome rock, he gazes upon the tumbling water-fall with a vacant eye; he views, without emotion, the glory of the &s;etting &s;un. Slowly he returns to his cell at even|ing, for no one there is anxious for his ar|rival; he has no comfort in his &s;olitary, unfavoury meal: he throws him&s;elf upon his couch of mo&s;s de&s;pondent and di&s;&s;a|tisfied, and wakes only to pa&s;s a day as joyle&s;s, as monotonous as the former."</P>
<P>"You amaze me, father! Suppo&s;e that circum&s;tances condemned you to &s;olitude; would not the duties of religion, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a life well &s;pent, commu|nicate to your heart that calm which&mdash;&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould deceive my&s;elf, did I fancy that they could. I am convinced of the

contrary, and that all my fortitude would not prevent me from yielding to melan|choly and di&s;gu&s;t. After con&s;uming the day in &s;tudy, if you knew my plea&s;ure at meeting my brethren in the evening! Af|ter pa&s;&s;ing many a long hour in &s;olitude, if I could expre&s;s to you the joy which I feel at once more beholding a fellow-crea|ture! 'Tis in this particular that I place the principal merit of a mona&s;tic in&s;titu|tion. It &s;ecludes man from the temptations of vice; it procures that lei&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary for the proper &s;ervice of the Supreme; it &s;pares him the mortification of witne&s;&s;ing the crimes of the worldly, and yet permits him to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. And do you, Ro&s;ario, do you envy an hermit's life? Can you be thus blind to the happi|ne&s;s of your &s;ituation? Reflect upon it for a moment. This abbey is become your a&s;ylum: your regularity, your gentlene&s;s, your talents have rendered you the object of univer&s;al e&s;teem: you are &s;ecluded from the world which you profe&s;s to hate; yet
<PB N="93" REF="99">
you remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the benefits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ociety, and that a &s;ociety compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t e&s;timable of mankind."</P>
<P>"Father! father! 'tis that which cau&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny torment. Happy had it been for me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad my life been pa&s;&s;ed among the vicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd abandoned; had I never heard pro|nounced the name of virtue. 'Tis my unbounded adoration of religion; 'tis my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oul's exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of the beauty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">air and good, that loads me with &s;hame&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat hurries me to perdition. Oh! that I had never &s;een the&s;e abbey-walls!"</P>
<P>"How, Ro&s;ario? When we la&s;t con|ver&s;ed, you &s;poke in a different tone. Is my friend&s;hip then become of &s;uch little con&s;equence? Had you never &s;een the&s;e abbey-walls, you never had &s;een me. Can that really be your wi&s;h?"</P>
<P>"Had never &s;een you?" repeated the novice, &s;tarting from the bank, and gra&s;p|ing the friar's hand with a frantic air&mdash; "You! you! Would to God that light|ning had bla&s;ted them before you ever
<PB N="94" REF="100">
met my eyes! Would to God that I were never to &s;ee you more, and could forget that I had ever &s;een you!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he flew ha&s;tily from the grotto. Ambro&s;io remained in his for|mer attitude, reflecting on the youth's un|accountable behaviour. He was inclined to &s;u&s;pect the derangement of his &s;en&s;es: yet the general tenor of his conduct, the connexion of his ideas, and calmne&s;s of his demeanour till the moment of his quit|ting the grotto, &s;eemed to di&s;countenance this conjecture. After a few minutes Ro|&s;ario returned. He again &s;eated him&s;elf upon the bank: he reclined his cheek upon one hand, and with the other wiped away the tears which trickled from his eyes at intervals.</P>
<P>The monk looked upon him with com|pa&s;&s;ion, and forbore to interrupt his medi|tations. Both ob&s;erved for &s;ome time a profound &s;ilence. The nightingale had now taken her &s;tation upon an orange-tree fronting the hermitage, and poured forth
<PB N="95" REF="101">
a &s;train the mo&s;t melancholy and melo|dious. Ro&s;ario rai&s;ed his head, and li&s;tened to her with attention.</P>
<P>"It was thus," &s;aid he, with a deep-drawn &s;igh, "it was thus that, during the la&s;t month of her unhappy life, my &s;i&s;ter u&s;ed to &s;it li&s;tening to the nightingale. Poor Matilda! &s;he &s;leeps in the grave, and her broken heart throbs no more with pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"You had a &s;i&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"You &s;ay right, that I <HI>bad.</HI> Alas! I have one no longer. She &s;unk beneath the weight of her &s;orrows in the very &s;pring of life."</P>
<P>"What were tho&s;e &s;orrows?"</P>
<P>"They will not excite <HI>your</HI> pity. <HI>You</HI> know not the power of tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible, tho&s;e fatal &s;entiments to which her heart was a prey. Father, &s;he loved unfortu|nately. A pa&s;&s;ion for one endowed with every virtue, for a man&mdash;oh! rather let me &s;ay for a divinity&mdash;proved the bane of her exi&s;tence. His noble form, his &s;potle&s;s cha|racter, his various talents, his wi&s;dom &s;olid,
<PB N="96" REF="102">
wonderful, and glorious, might have warmed the bo&s;om of the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible. My &s;i&s;ter &s;aw him, and dared to love, though &s;he never dared to hope."</P>
<P>"If her love was &s;o well be&s;towed, what forbad her to hope the obtaining of its object?"</P>
<P>"Father, before he knew her, Julian had already plighted his vows to a bride mo&s;t fair, mo&s;t heavenly! Yet &s;till my &s;i&s;ter loved, and for the hu&s;band's &s;ake &s;he doted upon the wife. One morning &s;he found means to e&s;cape from our father's hou&s;e: arrayed in humble weeds &s;he of|fered her&s;elf as a dome&s;tic to the con&s;ort of her beloved, and was accepted. She was now continually in his pre&s;ence: &s;he &s;trove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ingratiate her&s;elf into his favour: &s;he &s;ucceeded. Her attentions attracted Ju|lian's notice: the virtuous are ever grate|ful, and he di&s;tingui&s;hed Matilda above the re&s;t of her companions."</P>
<P>"And did not your parents &s;eek for her? Did they &s;ubmit tamely to their lo&s;s,
<PB N="97" REF="103">
nor attempt to recover their wandering daughter?"</P>
<P>"Ere they could find her, &s;he di&s;cover|ed her&s;elf. Her love grew too violent for concealment; yet &s;he wi&s;hed not for Ju|lian's per&s;on, &s;he ambitioned but a &s;hare of his heart. In an unguarded moment &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her affection. What was the re|turn? Doting upon his wife, and believing that a look of pity be&s;towed upon another was a theft from what he owed to her, he drove Matilda from his pre&s;ence: he for|bad her ever again appearing before him. His &s;everity broke her heart: &s;he returned to her father's, and in a few months after was carried to her grave."</P>
<P>"Unhappy girl! Surely her fate was too &s;evere, and Julian was too cruel."</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;o, father?" cried the novice with vivacity: "Do you think that he was cruel?"</P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s I do, and pity her mo&s;t &s;incerely."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">"You pity her? you pity her? Oh! father! father! then pity me&mdash;"</P>
<P>The friar &s;tarted; when, after a mo|ment's pau&s;e, Ro&s;ario added with a falter|ing voice, "for my &s;ufferings are &s;till greater. My &s;i&s;ter had a friend, a real friend, who pitied the acutene&s;s of her feel|ings, nor reproached her with her inability to repre&s;s them. I&mdash;! I have no friend! The whole wide world cannot furni&s;h an heart that is willing to participate in the &s;orrows of mine."</P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e words, he &s;obbed audibly. The friar was affected. He took Ro&s;ario's hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it with tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"You have no friend, &s;ay you? What then am I? Why will you not confide in me, and what can you fear? My &s;everity? Have I ever u&s;ed it with you? The dig|nity of my habit? Ro&s;ario, I lay a&s;ide the monk, and bid you con&s;ider me as no other than your friend, your father. Well may

I a&s;&s;ume that title, for never did parent watch over a child more fondly than I have watched over you.

Then lay a&s;ide your fears; &s;peak to me with openne&s;s: &s;peak to me, Ro&s;ario, and &s;ay that you will con|fide in me. If my aid or my pity can al|leviate your di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;&mdash;"</P>

<P>"Hold!" interrupted the novice. "Swear, that whatever be my &s;ecret, you will not oblige me to quit the mona&s;tery till my noviciate &s;hall expire."</P>

<P>The abbot &s;tarted at this unexpected avowal. Pro&s;trate on the ground lay the feigned Ro&s;ario, as if waiting in &s;ilence the deci&s;ion of his judge. A&s;toni&s;hment on the one part, apprehen&s;ion on the other, for &s;ome minutes chained them in the &s;ame attitudes, as they had been touched by the rod of &s;ome magician. At length reco|vering from his confu&s;ion, the monk quit|ted the grotto, and &s;ped with precipitation towards the abbey. His action did not e&s;cape the &s;uppliant. She &s;prang from the ground; &s;he ha&s;tened to follow him, overtook him, threw her&s;elf in his pa&s;&s;age, and embraced his knees. Ambro&s;io &s;trove in vain to di&s;engage him&s;elf from her gra&s;p.</P>
<P>"Do not fly me!" &s;he cried. "Leave me not abandoned to the impul&s;e of de|&s;pair! Li&s;ten, while I excu&s;e my impru|dence; while I acknowledge my &s;i&s;ter's

Amazed, embarra&s;&s;ed, and irre&s;olute, he found him&s;elf incapable of pronouncing a &s;yllable, and remained in &s;ilence gazing upon Matilda. This gave her opportunity to continue her explana|tion as follows:</P>
<P>"Think not, Ambro&s;io, that I come to rob your bride of your affections. No, believe me: Religion alone de&s;erves you; and far is it from Matilda's wi&s;h to draw you from the paths of virtue.

her&s;elf. Ambro&s;io, &s;carcely con&s;cious of what he did, followed her example, and &s;he proceeded in her di&s;cour&s;e:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;pring from a di&s;tingui&s;hed family; my father was chief of the noble hou&s;e of Villanegas: he died while I was &s;till an in|fant, and left me &s;ole heire&s;s of his immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

while my guardian laboured to enlarge the &s;phere of my knowledge, he carefully in|culcated every moral precept: he relieved me from the &s;hackles of vulgar prejudice: he pointed out the beauty of religion: he taught me to look with adoration upon the pure and virtuous; and, wo is me!

<P>"With &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, judge whether I could ob&s;erve with any other &s;entiment than di&s;gu&s;t, the vice, di&s;&s;ipation, and igno|rance which di&s;grace our Spani&s;h youth.

&s;carcely dared to breathe, fearing to lo&s;e a &s;yllable; and while you &s;poke, methought a radiant glory beamed round your head, and your countenance &s;hone with the ma|je&s;ty of a god. I retired from the church, glowing with admiration. From that mo|ment you became the idol of my heart; the never-changing object of my meditations. I enquired re&s;pecting you. The reports which were made me of your mode of life, of your knowledge, piety, and &s;elf-denial, riveted the chains impo&s;ed on me by your eloquence. I was con&s;cious that there was no longer a void in my heart; that I had found the man whom I had &s;ought till then, in vain. In expectation of hearing you, again, every day I vi&s;ited your cathedral: you remained &s;ecluded within the abbey walls, and I always withdrew, wretched and di&s;appointed. The night was more propi+tious to me, for then you &s;tood before me in my dreams; you vowed to me eternal friend&s;hip; you led me through the paths of virtue, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to &s;upport the

vexations of life. The morning di&s;pelled the&s;e plea&s;ing vi&s;ions: I awoke, and found my&s;elf &s;eparated from you by barriers which appeared in&s;urmountable. Time &s;eemed only to increa&s;e the &s;trength of my pa&s;&s;ion: I grew melancholy and de&s;pondent; I fled from &s;ociety, and my health declined daily. At length, no longer able to exi&s;t in this &s;tate of torture, I re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;|gui&s;e in which you &s;ee me.

<P>"Now, then, I &s;hould have felt com|pletely happy, had not my quiet been di&s;|turbed by the fear of detection.

<P>By degrees he recovered from his confu|&s;ion: his ideas became le&s;s bewildered: he was immediately &s;en&s;ible of the extreme im|propriety, &s;hould Matilda be permitted to remain in the abbey after this avowal of her &s;ex. He a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;everity, and drew away his hand.</P>
<P>"How, lady!" &s;aid he, "can you really hope for my permi&s;&s;ion to remain among&s;t us? Even were I to grant your reque&s;t, what good could you derive from it? Think you, that I ever can reply to an af|fection, which&mdash;"</P>

<P>He pronounced the&s;e words in a faint and trembling voice; then, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, he would have ha&s;tened towards the mo|na&s;tery. Uttering a loud &s;hriek, Matilda followed, and detained him.</P>
<P>"Stay yet one moment, Ambro&s;io! hear me yet &s;peak one word!"</P>
<P>"I dare not li&s;ten. Relea&s;e me: you know my re&s;olution."</P>

<P>"Leave me. Your entreaties are in vain: you mu&s;t from hence to-morrow."</P>
<P>"Go then, barbarian! But this re&s;ource is &s;till left me."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he &s;uddenly drew a poniard. She rent open her garment, and
<PB N="113" REF="119">
placed the weapon's point again&s;t her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Father, I will never quit the&s;e walls alive."</P>
<P>"Hold! hold, Matilda! what would you do?"</P>
<P>"You are determined, &s;o am I: the mo|ment that you leave me, I plunge this &s;teel in my heart."</P>
<P>"Holy St. Francis! Matilda, have you your &s;en&s;es? Do you know the con&s;e|quences of your action? that &s;uicide is the greate&s;t of crimes? that you de&s;troy your &s;oul? that you lo&s;e your claim to &s;alvation? that you prepare for your&s;elf everla&s;ting torments?"</P>
<P>"I care not, I care not," &s;he replied pa&s;&s;ionately: "either your hand guides me to paradi&s;e, or my own dooms me to per|dition. Speak to me, Ambro&s;io! Tell me that you will conceal my &s;tory; that I &s;hall remain your friend and your companion, or this poniard drinks my blood."</P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, &s;he lifted
<PB N="114" REF="120">
her arm, and made a motion as if to &s;tab her&s;elf. The friar's eyes followed with dread the cour&s;e of the dagger. She had torn open her habit, and her bo&s;om was half expo&s;ed. The weapon's point re&s;ted upon her left brea&s;t: and, oh! that was &s;uch a brea&s;t! The moon-beams darting full upon it enabled the monk to ob&s;erve its dazzling whitene&s;s: his eye dwelt with in|&s;atiable avidity upon the beauteous orb: a &s;en&s;ation till then unknown filled his heart with a mixture of anxiety and delight; a raging fire &s;hot through every limb; the blood boiled in his veins, and a thou&s;and wild wi&s;hes bewildered his imagination.</P>
<P>"Hold!" he cried, in an hurried, fal|tering voice; "I can re&s;i&s;t no longer! Stay then, enchantre&s;s! &s;tay for my de&s;truc|tion!".</P>
<P>He &s;aid; and, ru&s;hing from the place, ha&s;tened towards the mona&s;tery: he regained his cell, and threw him&s;elf upon his couch, di&s;tracted, irre&s;olute and confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>He found it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;ome time to
<PB N="115" REF="121">
arrange his ideas. The &s;cene in which he had been engaged, had excited &s;uch a va|riety of &s;entiments in his bo&s;om, that he was incapable of deciding which was pre|dominant. He was irre&s;olute what conduct he ought to hold with the di&s;turber of his repo&s;e; he was con&s;cious that prudence, re|ligion, and propriety, nece&s;&s;itated his oblig|ing her to quit the abbey: but, on the other hand, &s;uch powerful rea&s;ons authori&s;ed her &s;tay, that he was but too much inclined to con&s;ent to her remaining. He could not avoid being flattered by Matilda's declara|tion, and at reflecting that he had uncon|&s;ciou&s;ly vanqui&s;hed an heart which had re|&s;i&s;ted the attacks of Spain's noble&s;t cavaliers. The manner in which he had gained her affections was al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to his vanity: he remembered the many happy hours which he had pa&s;&s;ed in Ro&s;ario's &s;o|ciety; and dreaded that void in his heart which parting with him would occa&s;ion. Be&s;ides all this, he con&s;idered, that as Ma|tilda
<PB N="116" REF="122">
was wealthy, her favour might be of e&s;&s;ential benefit to the abbey.</P>
<P>"And what do I ri&s;k," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "by authorizing her &s;tay? May I not &s;afely credit her a&s;&s;ertions? Will it not be ea&s;y for me to forget her &s;ex, and &s;till con&s;ider her as my friend and my di&s;ciple? Surely her love is as pure as &s;he de&s;cribes: had it been the offspring of mere licentiou&s;ne&s;s, would &s;he &s;o long have concealed it in her own bo&s;om? Would &s;he not have employed &s;ome means to procure its gratification? She has done quite the contrary: &s;he &s;trove to keep me in ignorance of her &s;ex; and nothing but the fear of detection, and my in&s;tances, would have compelled her to reveal the &s;ecret: &s;he has ob&s;erved the duties of religion not le&s;s &s;trictly than my&s;elf: &s;he has made no attempt to rou&s;e my &s;lumbering pa&s;&s;ions, nor has &s;he ever conver&s;ed with me till this night on the &s;ubject of love. Had &s;he been de&s;irous to gain my affections, not my e&s;teem, &s;he would not have concealed from me her
<PB N="117" REF="123">
charms &s;o carefully: at this very moment I have never &s;een her face; yet certainly that face mu&s;t be lovely, and her per&s;on beautiful, to judge by her&mdash;by what I have &s;een."</P>
<P>As this la&s;t idea pa&s;&s;ed through his ima|gination, a blu&s;h &s;pread it&s;elf over his cheek. Alarmed at the &s;entiments which he was in|dulging, he betook him&s;elf to prayer: he &s;tarted from his couch, knelt before the beautiful Madona, and entreated her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in &s;tifling &s;uch culpable emotions: he then returned to his bed, and re&s;igned him|&s;elf to &s;lumber.</P>
<P>He awoke heated and unrefre&s;hed. During his &s;leep, his inflamed imagination had pre|&s;ented him with none but the mo&s;t voluptuous objects. Matilda &s;tood before him in his dreams, and his eyes again dwelt upon her naked brea&s;t; &s;he repeated her prote&s;tations of eternal love, threw her arms round his neck, and loaded him with ki&s;&s;es: he returned them; he cla&s;ped her pa&s;&s;ionately to his bo|&s;om, and&mdash;the vi&s;ion was di&s;&s;olved. Some|times his dreams pre&s;ented the image of his
<PB N="118" REF="124">
favourite Madona, and he fancied that he was kneeling before her: as he offered up his vows to her, the eyes of the figure &s;eemed to beam on him with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s; he pre&s;&s;ed his lips to hers, and found them warm: the animated form &s;tarted from the canvas, embraced him affectionately, and his &s;en&s;es were unable to &s;upport delight &s;o exqui&s;ite. Such were the &s;cenes on which his thoughts were employed while &s;leeping: his un&s;atisfied de&s;ires placed before him the mo&s;t lu&s;tful and provoking images, and he rioted in joys till then unknown to him.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted from his couch, filled with confu&s;ion at the remembrance of his dreams: &s;carcely was he le&s;s a&s;hamed when he re|flected on his rea&s;ons of the former night, which induced him to authori&s;e Matilda's &s;tay. The cloud was now di&s;&s;ipated which had ob&s;cured his judgment; he &s;huddered when he beheld his arguments blazoned in their proper colours, and found that he had been a &s;lave to flattery, to avarice, and &s;elf-love. If in one hour's conver&s;ation Ma|tilda
<PB N="119" REF="125">
had produced a change &s;o remarkable in his &s;entiments, what had he not to dread from her remaining in the abbey? Be|come &s;en&s;ible of his danger, awakened from his dream of confidence, he re&s;olved to in|&s;i&s;t on her departing without delay: he be|gan to feel that he was not proof again&s;t temptation; and that, however Matilda might re&s;train her&s;elf within the bounds of mode&s;ty, he was unable to contend with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions from which he fal&s;ely thought him&s;elf exempted.</P>
<P>"Agnes! Agnes!" he exclaimed, while reflecting on his embarra&s;&s;ments, "I al|ready feel thy cur&s;e!"</P>
<P>He quitted his cell, determined upon di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing the feigned Ro&s;ario. He appeared at matins; but his thoughts were ab&s;ent, and he paid them but little attention: his heart and brain were both of them filled with worldly objects, and he prayed with|out devotion. The &s;ervice over, he de|&s;cended into the garden; he bent his &s;teps towards the &s;ame &s;pot where on the pre|ceding
<PB N="120" REF="126">
night he had made this embarra&s;&s;ing di&s;covery: he doubted not that Matilda would &s;eek him there. He was not deceived: &s;he &s;oon entered the hermitage, and ap|proached the monk with a timid air. After a few minutes, during which both were &s;ilent, &s;he appeared as if on the point of &s;peaking; but the abbot, who during this time had been &s;ummoning up all his re&s;o|lution, ha&s;tily interrupted her. Though &s;till uncon&s;cious how exten&s;ive was its influence, he dreaded the melodious &s;eduction of her voice.</P>
<P>"Seat your&s;elf by my &s;ide, Matilda," &s;aid he, a&s;&s;uming a look of firmne&s;s, though care|fully avoiding the lea&s;t mixture of &s;everity; "li&s;ten to me patiently, and believe that, in what I &s;hall &s;ay, I am not more influenced by my own intere&s;t than by yours; believe that I feel for you the warme&s;t friend&s;hip, the true&s;t compa&s;&s;ion; and that you cannot feel more grieved than I do, when I declare to you that we mu&s;t never meet again."</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io!" &s;he cried, in a voice at

once expre&s;&s;ive both of &s;urpri&s;e and of &s;or|row.</P>
<P>"Be calm, my friend! my Ro&s;ario! &s;till let me call you by that name &s;o dear to me: our &s;eparation is unavoidable; I blu&s;h to own how &s;en&s;ibly it affects me.&mdash;But yet it mu&s;t be &s;o; I feel my&s;elf incapable of treat|ing you with indifference; and that very conviction obliges me to in&s;i&s;t upon your departure. Matilda, you mu&s;t &s;tay here no longer."</P>
<P>"Oh! where &s;hall I now &s;eek for probity? Di&s;gu&s;ted with a perfidious world, in what happy region does Truth conceal her&s;elf? Father, I hoped that &s;he re&s;ided here; I thought that your bo&s;om had been her fa|vourite &s;hrine. And you too prove fal&s;e? Oh God! and you too can betray me?"</P>
<P>"Matilda?"</P>
<P>"Yes, father, yes; 'tis with ju&s;tice that I reproach you. Oh! where are your pro|mi&s;es? My noviciate is not expired, and yet will you compel me to quit the mo|na&s;tery? Can you have the heart to drive me

<P>"I will not compel you to quit the mo|na&s;tery; you have received my &s;olemn oath to the contrary: but yet, when I throw my|&s;elf upon your genero&s;ity; when I declare to you the embarra&s;&s;ments in which your pre|&s;ence involves me, will you not relea&s;e me from that oath? Reflect upon the danger of a di&s;covery; upon the opprobrium in which &s;uch an event would plunge me: re|flect, that my honour and reputation are at &s;take; and that my peace of mind depends on your compliance. As yet, my heart is free; I &s;hall &s;eparate from you with regret, but not with de&s;pair. Stay here, and a few weeks will &s;acrifice my happine&s;s on the al|tar of your charms; you are but too inter|e&s;ting, too amiable!

<P>"Cruel! cruel!" &s;he exclaimed, wring|ing her hands in agony; "you know too well that you offer me no choice: you know too well that I can have no will but yours!"</P>
<P>"I was not then deceived. Matilda's genero&s;ity equals my expectations."</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="130">"Yes; I will prove the truth of my affection by &s;ubmitting to a decree which cuts me to the very heart. Take back your promi&s;e. I will quit the mona&s;tery this very day.

<P>"Something&mdash;any thing&mdash;one of tho&s;e flowers will be &s;ufficient." [Here &s;he pointed to a bu&s;h of ro&s;es, planted at the door of the grotto.] "I will hide it in my bo&s;om,

<P>Here the pain of his wound became &s;o exqui&s;ite, that nature was unable to bear it: his &s;en&s;es abandoned him, and he &s;unk inanimate into Matilda's arms.</P>
<P>Her di&s;tre&s;s was beyond the power of de&s;cription. She rent her hair, beat her bo&s;om, and, not daring to quit Ambro&s;io,
<PB N="126" REF="132">
endeavoured by loud cries to &s;ummon the monks to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She at length &s;uc|ceeded. Alarmed by her &s;hrieks, &s;everal of the brothers ha&s;tened to the &s;pot, and the &s;uperior was conveyed back to the ab|bey. He was immediately put to bed, and the monk, who officiated as &s;urgeon to the fraternity, prepared to examine the wound. By this time Ambro&s;io's hand had &s;welled to an extraordinary &s;ize: the remedies which had been admini&s;tered to him, 'tis true, re&s;tored him to life, but not to his &s;en&s;es: he raved in all the horrors of delirium, foamed at the mouth, and four of the &s;tronge&s;t monks were &s;carcely able to hold him in his bed.</P>
<P>Father Pablos (&s;uch was the &s;urgeon's name) ha&s;tened to examine the wounded hand. The monks &s;urrounded the bed, anxiou&s;ly waiting for the deci&s;ion: among the&s;e the feigned Ro&s;ario appeared not the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to the friar's calamity: he gazed upon the &s;ufferer with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h; and his groans, which every mo|ment
<PB N="127" REF="133">
e&s;caped from his bo&s;om, &s;ufficiently betrayed the violence of his affliction.</P>
<P>Father Pablos probed the wound. As he drew out his lancet, its point was tinged with a greeni&s;h hue. He &s;hook his head mournfully, and quitted the bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>"'Tis as I feared," &s;aid he; "there is no hope."</P>
<P>"No hope!" exclaimed the monks with one voice; "&s;ay you, no hope?"</P>
<P>"From the &s;udden effects, I &s;u&s;pected that the abbot was &s;tung by a cientipedo|ro <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cientipedoro is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a native of Cuba, and to have been brought into Spain from that &s;tand in the ve&s;&s;el of Columbus.</NOTE>: the venom which you &s;ee upon my lancet confirms my idea. He cannot live three days."</P>
<P>"And can no po&s;&s;ible remedy be found?" enquired Ro&s;ario.</P>
<P>"Without extracting the poi&s;on, he cannot recover; and how to extract it is to me &s;till a &s;ecret. All that I can do is to apply &s;uch herbs to the wound as will re|lieve
<PB N="128" REF="134">
the angui&s;h: the patient will be re|&s;tored to his &s;en&s;es; but the venom will corrupt the whole ma&s;s of his blood, and in three days he will exi&s;t no longer."</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive was the univer&s;al grief at hear|ing this deci&s;ion. Pablos, as he had pro|mi&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed the wound, and then retired, followed by his companions. Ro&s;ario alone remained in the cell, the abbot, at his ur|gent entreaty, having been committed to his care. Ambro&s;io's &s;trength worn out by the violence of his exertions, he had by this time fallen into a profound &s;leep. So totally was he overcome by wearine&s;s, that he &s;carcely gave any &s;igns of life. He was &s;till in this &s;ituation, when the monks re|turned to enquire whether any change had taken place. Pablos loo&s;ened the bondage which concealed the wound, more from a principle of curio&s;ity, than from indulging the hope of di&s;covering any favourable &s;ymptoms. What was his a&s;toni&s;hment at finding that the inflammation had totally &s;ub&s;ided! He probed the hand; his lancet
<PB N="129" REF="135">
came out pure and un&s;ullied; no traces of the venom were perceptible; and had not the orifice &s;till been vi&s;ible, Pablos might have doubted that there had ever been a wound.</P>
<P>He communicated this intelligence to his brethren: their delight was only equalled by their &s;urpri&s;e. From the latter &s;enti|ment, however, they were &s;oon relea&s;ed, by explaining the circum&s;tance according to their own ideas. They were perfectly con|vinced that their &s;uperior was a &s;aint, and thought that nothing could be more natu|ral than for St. Francis to have operated a miracle in his favour. This opinion was adopted unanimou&s;ly. They declared it &s;o loudly, and vociferated "A miracle! a miracle!" with &s;uch fervour, that they &s;oon interrupted Ambro&s;io's &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>The monks immediately crowded round his bed, and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction at his wonderful recovery. He was perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, and free from every com|plaint, except feeling weak and languid.
<PB N="130" REF="136">
Pablos gave him a &s;trengthening medi|cine, and advi&s;ed his keeping his bed for the two &s;ucceeding days: he then retired, having de&s;ired his patient not to exhau&s;t him&s;elf by conver&s;ation, but rather to en|deavour at taking &s;ome repo&s;e. The other monks followed his example, and the abbot and Ro&s;ario were left without ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes Ambro&s;io regarded his attendant with a look of mingled plea|&s;ure and apprehen&s;ion. She was &s;eated upon the &s;ide of the bed, her head bending down, and, as u&s;ual, enveloped in the cowl of her habit.</P>
<P>"And you are &s;till here, Matilda?" &s;aid the friar at length; "are you not &s;a|tisfied with having &s;o nearly effected my de|&s;truction, that nothing but a miracle could have &s;aved me from the grave? Ah! &s;urely heaven &s;ent that &s;erpent to puni&s;h&mdash;"</P>
<P>Matilda interrupted him by putting her hand before his lips with an air of gaiety.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! father, hu&s;h! you mu&s;t not talk."</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137">"He who impo&s;ed that order, knew not how intere&s;ting are the &s;ubjects on which I wi&s;h to &s;peak."</P>
<P>"But I know it, and yet i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame po&s;itive command. I am appointed your nur&s;e, and you mu&s;t not di&s;obey my orders."</P>
<P>"You are in &s;pirits, Matilda!"</P>
<P>"Well may I be &s;o; I have ju&s;t received a plea&s;ure unexampled through my whole life."</P>
<P>"What was that plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"What I mu&s;t conceal from all, but mo&s;t from you."</P>
<P>"But mo&s;t from me? Nay then, I en|treat you, Matilda&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! father, hu&s;h! you mu&s;t not talk. But as you do not &s;eem inclined to &s;leep, &s;hall I endeavour to amu&s;e you with my harp?"</P>
<P>"How! I knew not that you under&s;tood mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>"Oh! I am a &s;orry performer! Yet as &s;ilence is pre&s;cribed you for eight-and-forty
<PB N="132" REF="138">
hours, I may po&s;&s;ibly entertain you, when wearied of your own reflections. I go to fetch my harp."</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned with it.</P>
<P>"Now, father, what &s;hall I &s;ing? Will you hear the ballad which treats of the gal|lant Durandarte, who died in the famous battle of Roncevalles?"</P>
<P>"What you plea&s;e, Matilda."</P>
<P>"Oh! call me not Matilda! Call me Ro&s;ario, call me your friend. Tho&s;e are the names which I love to hear from your lips. Now li&s;ten."</P>
<P>She then tuned her harp, and afterwards preluded for &s;ome moments with &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite ta&s;te as to prove her a perfect mi&s;|tre&s;s of the in&s;trument. The air which &s;he played was &s;oft and plaintive. Ambro&s;io, while he li&s;tened, felt his unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ub&s;ide, and a plea&s;ing melancholy &s;pread it&s;elf into his bo&s;om. Suddenly Matilda changed the &s;train: with an hand bold and rapid, &s;he &s;truck a few loud martial chords, and then

chanted the following ballad to an air at once &s;imple and melodious:

<P>While &s;he &s;ung, Ambro&s;io li&s;tened with delight: never had he heard a voice more harmonious; and he wondered how &s;uch
<PB N="136" REF="142">
heavenly &s;ounds could be produced by any but angels. But though he indulged the &s;en&s;e of hearing, a &s;ingle look convinced him, that he mu&s;t not tru&s;t to that of &s;ight. The &s;ong&s;tre&s;s &s;at at a little di&s;tance from his bed. The attitude in which &s;he bent over her harp was ea&s;y and graceful: her cowl had fallen backwarder than u&s;ual: two coral lips were vi&s;ible, ripe, fre&s;h, and melting, and a chin, in who&s;e dimples &s;eemed to lurk a thou&s;and Cupids. Her habit's long &s;leeve would have &s;wept along the chords of the in&s;trument: to prevent this inconvenience &s;he had drawn it above her elbow; and by this means an arm was di&s;covered, formed in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ym|metry, the delicacy of who&s;e &s;kin might have contended with &s;now in whitene&s;s. Ambro&s;io dared to look on her but once: that glance &s;ufficed to convince him, how dangerous was the pre&s;ence of this &s;edu|cing object. He clo&s;ed his eyes, but &s;trove in vain to bani&s;h her from his thoughts. There &s;he &s;till moved before him, adorned
<PB N="137" REF="143">
with all tho&s;e charms which his heated ima|gination could &s;upply. Every beauty which he had &s;een appeared embelli&s;hed; and tho&s;e &s;till concealed fancy repre&s;ented to him in glowing colours. Still, however, his vows, and the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping to them, were pre&s;ent to his memory. He &s;truggled with de&s;ire, and &s;huddered when he beheld how deep was the precipice before him.</P>
<P>Matilda cea&s;ed to &s;ing. Dreading the influence of her charms, Ambro&s;io remained with his eyes clo&s;ed, and offered up his pray|ers to St. Francis to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this dan|gerous trial! Matilda believed that he was &s;leeping: &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, ap|proached the bed &s;oftly, and for &s;ome mi|nutes gazed upon him attentively.</P>
<P>"He &s;leeps!" &s;aid &s;he at length in a low voice, but who&s;e accents the abbot di&s;tin|gui&s;hed perfectly: "now then I may gaze upon him without offence; I may mix my breath with his; I may doat upon his fea|tures, and he cannot &s;u&s;pect me of impurity and deceit. He fears my &s;educing him to
<PB N="138" REF="144">
the violation of his vows. Oh! the unju&s;t! Were it my wi&s;h to excite de&s;ire, &s;hould I conceal my features from him &s;o carefully? &mdash;tho&s;e features, of which I daily hear him&mdash;"</P>
<P>She &s;topped, and was lo&s;t in her reflec|tions.</P>
<P>"It was but ye&s;terday," &s;he continued; "but a few &s;hort hours have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I was dear to him; he e&s;teemed me, and my heart was &s;atisfied: now, oh! now, how cru|elly is my &s;ituation changed! He looks on me with &s;u&s;picion; he bids me leave him, leave him for ever. Oh! you, my &s;aint, my idol! You! holding the next place to God in my brea&s;t, yet two days, and my heart will be unveiled to you. Could you know my feelings, when I beheld your agony! Could you know how much your &s;ufferings have endeared you to me! But the time will come, when you will be convinced that my pa&s;&s;ion is pure and di&s;intere&s;ted. Then you will pity me, and feel the whole weight of the&s;e &s;orrows."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, her voice was choaked by
<PB N="139" REF="145">
weeping. While &s;he bent over Ambro&s;io, a tear fell upon his cheek.</P>
<P>"Ah! I have di&s;turbed him," cried Matilda, and retreated ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>Her alarm was ungrounded. None &s;leep &s;o profoundly as tho&s;e who are determined not to wake. The friar was in this predi|cament: he &s;till &s;eemed buried in a repo&s;e, which every &s;ucceeding minute rendered him le&s;s capable of enjoying. The burn|ing tear had communicated its warmth to his heart.</P>
<P>"What affection! what purity!" &s;aid he internally. "Ah! &s;ince my bo&s;om is thus &s;en&s;ible of pity, what would it be if agitated by love?"</P>
<P>Matilda again quitted her &s;eat, and re|tired to &s;ome di&s;tance from the bed. Am|bro&s;io ventured to open his eyes, and to ca&s;t them upon her fearfully. Her face was turned from him. She re&s;ted her head in a melancholy po&s;ture upon her harp, and gazed on the picture which hung oppo|&s;ite to the bed.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146">"Happy, happy image!" Thus did &s;he addre&s;s the beautiful Madona; "'tis to you that he offers his prayers; 'tis on you that he gazes with admiration.

With what plea&s;ure he views this picture! With what fervour he addre&s;&s;es his prayers to the in&s;en&s;ible image! Ah! may not his &s;entiments be in&s;pired by &s;ome kind and &s;ecret genius, friend to my affection? May it not be man's natural in&s;tinct which, in|forms him &mdash;? Be &s;ilent! idle hopes! let me not encourage an idea, which takes from the brilliance of Ambro&s;io's virtue. 'Tis religion, not beauty, which attracts his admiration; 'tis not to the woman, but the divinity that he kneels. Would he but addre&s;s to me the lea&s;t tender expre&s;&s;ion which he pours forth to this Madona! Would he but &s;ay, that were he not already
<PB N="141" REF="147">
affianced to the church, he would not have de&s;pi&s;ed Matilda! Oh! let me nouri&s;h that fond idea. Perhaps he may yet acknow|ledge that he feels for me more than pity, and that affection like mine might well have de&s;erved a return. Perhaps he may own thus much when I lie on my death-bed. He then need not fear to infringe his vows, and the confe&s;&s;ion of his regard will &s;often the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gs of dying. Would I were &s;ure of this! Oh! how earne&s;tly &s;hould I &s;igh for the moment of di&s;&s;olution!"</P>
<P>Of this di&s;cour&s;e the abbot lo&s;t not a &s;yllable; and the tone in which &s;he pro|nounced the&s;e la&s;t words pierced to his heart. Involuntarily he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from his pillow.</P>
<P>"Matilda!" he &s;aid in a troubled voice; "Oh! my Matilda!"</P>
<P>She &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and turned to|wards him ha&s;tily. The &s;uddenne&s;s of her movement made her cowl fall back from her head; her features became vi&s;ible to the monk's enquiring eye. What was his
<PB N="142" REF="148">
amazement at beholding the exact re&s;em|blance of his admired Madona! The &s;ame exqui&s;ite proportion of features, the &s;ame profu&s;ion of golden hair, the &s;ame ro&s;y lips, heavenly eyes, and maje&s;ty of countenance adorned Matilda! Uttering an exclama|tion of &s;urpri&s;e, Ambro&s;io &s;unk back upon his pillow, and doubted whether the object before him was mortal or divine.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;eemed penetrated with confu|&s;ion. She remained motionle&s;s in her place, and &s;upported her&s;elf upon her in&s;trument. Her eyes were bent upon the earth, and her fair cheeks over&s;pread with blu&s;hes. On recovering her&s;elf, her fir&s;t action was to conceal her features. She then, in an un&s;teady and troubled voice, ventured to addre&s;s the&s;e words to the friar:</P>
<P>"Accident has made you ma&s;ter of a &s;ecret, which I never would have revealed but on the bed of death: yes, Ambro&s;io, in Matilda de Villanegas you &s;ee the ori|ginal of your beloved Madona. Soon after I conceived my unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, I formed
<PB N="143" REF="149">
the project of conveying to you my picture. Crowds of admirers had per&s;uaded me that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome beauty, and I was anxious to know what effect it would produce upon you. I cau&s;ed my portrait to be drawn by Martin Galuppi, a celebrated Venetian at that time re&s;ident in Madrid. The re&s;em|blance was &s;triking: I &s;ent it to the Capu|chin-abbey as if for &s;ale; and the Jew from whom you bought it was one of my emi&s;|&s;aries. You purcha&s;ed it. Judge of my rapture, when informed that you had gazed upon it with delight, or rather with adora|tion; that you had &s;u&s;pended it in your cell, and that you addre&s;&s;ed your &s;upplica|tions to no other &s;aint! Will this di&s;covery make me &s;till more regarded as an object of &s;u&s;picion? Rather &s;hould it convince you how pure is my affection, and engage you to &s;uffer me in your &s;ociety and e&s;teem. I heard you daily extol the prai&s;es of my portrait. I was an eye witne&s;s of the tran&s;|ports which its beauty excited in you: yet I forbore to u&s;e again&s;t your virtue tho&s;e

I &s;trove no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to excite de&s;ire by di&s;playing my charms, or to make my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of your hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> through the medium of your &s;en&s;es. To attract your notice by &s;tudiou&s;ly attending to religious duties, to endear my&s;elf to you by convincing you that my mind was vir|tuous and my attachment &s;incere, &s;uch was my only aim. I &s;ucceeded; I became your companion and your friend. I concealed my &s;ex from your knowledge; and had you not pre&s;&s;ed me to reveal my &s;ecret, had I not been tormented by the fear of a di&s;co|very, never had you known me for any other than Ro&s;ario. And &s;till are you re|&s;olved to drive me from you? The few hours of life which yet remain for me, may I not pa&s;s them in your pre&s;ence? Oh! &s;peak, Ambro&s;io, and tell me that I may &s;tay."</P>
<P>This &s;peech gave the abbot an oppor|tunity of recollecting him&s;elf. He was
<PB N="145" REF="151">
con&s;cious that, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of his mind, avoiding her &s;ociety was his only refuge from the power of this enchanting woman.</P>

<P>"I obey you; but, before I go, promi&s;e not to In&s;i&s;t upon my quitting the abbey immediately."</P>
<P>"Matilda, reflect upon your &s;ituation: reflect upon the con&s;equences of your &s;tay: our &s;eparation is indi&s;pen&s;able, and we mu&s;t part."</P>
<P>"But not to day, father! Oh! in pity, not to-day!"</P>
<P>"You pre&s;s me too hard; but I cannot re&s;i&s;t that tone of &s;upplication. Since you in&s;i&s;t upon it, I yield to your prayer; I con&s;ent to your remaining here a &s;ufficient time to prepare, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the bre|thren for your departure: &s;tay yet two days;
<PB N="146" REF="152">
but on the third"&mdash;(He &s;ighed involun|tarily)&mdash;"remember, that on the third we mu&s;t part for ever!"</P>
<P>She caught his hand eagerly, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips.</P>
<P>"On the third!" &s;he exclaimed with an air of wild &s;olemnity: "You are right, fa|ther, you are right! On the third we mu&s;t part for ever!"</P>
<P>There was a dreadful expre&s;&s;ion in her eye as &s;he uttered the&s;e words, which pene|trated the friar's &s;oul with horror. Again &s;he ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and then fled with rapidity from the chamber.</P>
<P>Anxious to authori&s;e the pre&s;ence of his dangerous gue&s;t, yet con&s;cious that her &s;tay was infringing the laws of his order, Am|bro&s;io's bo&s;om became the theatre of a thou&s;and contending pa&s;&s;ions. At length his attachment to the feigned Ro&s;ario, aided by the natural warmth of his temperament, &s;eemed-likely to obtain the victory: the &s;ucce&s;s was a&s;&s;ured, when that pre&s;umption which formed the ground-work of his cha|racter
<PB N="147" REF="153">
came to Matilda's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The monk reflected, that to vanqui&s;h tempta|tion was an infinitely greater merit than to avoid it; he thought that he ought rather to rejoice in the opportunity given him of proving the firmne&s;s of his virtue. St. An|thony had with&s;tood all &s;eductions to lu&s;t, then why &s;hould not he? Be&s;ides, St. An|thony was tempted by the devil, who put every art into practice to excite his pa&s;&s;ions; whereas Ambro&s;io's danger proceeded from a mere mortal woman, fearful and mode&s;t, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions of his yielding were not le&s;s violent than his own.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid he, "the unfortunate &s;hall &s;tay; I have nothing to fear from her pre|&s;ence: even &s;hould my own prove too weak to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, I am &s;ecured from danger by the innocence of Matilda."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was yet to learn, that to an heart unacquainted with her, vice is ever mo&s;t dangerous when lurking behind the ma&s;k of virtue.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf &s;o perfectly recovered,
<PB N="148" REF="154">
that, when father Pablos vi&s;ited him again at night, he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to quit his chamber on the day following. His reque&s;t was granted. Matilda appeared no more that evening, except in company with the monks when they came in a body to en|quire after the abbot's health. She &s;eemed fearful of conver&s;ing with him in private, and &s;tayed but a few minutes in his room. The friar &s;lept well; but the dreams of the former night were repeated, and his &s;en&s;a|tions of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s were yet more keen and exqui&s;ite; the &s;ame lu&s;t-exciting vi|&s;ions floated before his eyes; Matilda, in all the pomp of beauty, warm, tender and luxurious, cla&s;ped him to her bo&s;om, and lavi&s;hed upon him the mo&s;t ardent care&s;&s;es. He returned them as eagerly; and already was on the point of &s;atisfying his de&s;ires, when the faithle&s;s form di&s;appeared, and left him to all the horrors of &s;hame and di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>The morning dawned. Fatigued, ha|ra&s;&s;ed, and exhau&s;ted by his provoking
<PB N="149" REF="155">
dreams, he was not di&s;po&s;ed to quit his bed: he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from appearing at ma|tins: it was the fir&s;t morning in his life that he had ever mi&s;&s;ed them. He ro&s;e late: during the whole of the day he had no op|portunity of &s;peaking to Matilda without witne&s;&s;es; his cell was thronged by the monks, anxious to expre&s;s their concern at his illne&s;s; and he was &s;till occupied in re|ceiving their compliments on his recovery, when the bell &s;ummoned them to the re|fectory.</P>
<P>After dinner the monks &s;eparated, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in various parts of the garden, where the &s;hade of trees, or retire|ment of &s;ome grotto, pre&s;ented the mo&s;t agreeable means of enjoying the fie&s;ta. The abbot bent his &s;teps towards the hermitage; a glance of his eye invited Matilda to ac|company him: &s;he obeyed, and followed him thither in &s;ilence: they entered the grotto, and &s;eated them&s;elves: both &s;eemed unwilling to begin the conver&s;ation, and to labour under the influence of mutual em|barra&s;&s;ment.
<PB N="150" REF="156">
At length the abbot &s;poke: he conver&s;ed only on indifferent topics, and Matilda an&s;wered him in the &s;ame tone; &s;he &s;eemed anxious to make him forget that the per&s;on who &s;at by him was any other than Ro&s;ario. Neither of them dared, or in|deed wi&s;hed, to make an allu&s;ion to the &s;ubject which was mo&s;t at the hearts of both.</P>
<P>Matilda's efforts to appear gay were evi|dently forced; her &s;pirits were oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of anxiety; and when &s;he &s;poke, her voice was low and feeble: &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of fini&s;hing a conver&s;ation which embarra&s;&s;ed her; and, complaining that &s;he was unwell, &s;he reque&s;ted Ambro&s;io's per|mi&s;&s;ion to return to the abbey. He accom|panied her to the door of her cell; and, when arrived there, he &s;topped her to declare his con&s;ent to her continuing the partner of his &s;olitude, &s;o long as &s;hould be agreeable to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She di&s;covered no marks of plea&s;ure at receiving this intelligence, though on the
<PB N="151" REF="157">
preceding day &s;he had been &s;o anxious to obtain the permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Alas, father," &s;he &s;aid, waving her head mournfully, "your kindne&s;s comes too late; my doom is fixed; we mu&s;t &s;eparate for ever; yet believe that I am grateful for your genero&s;ity; for your compa&s;&s;ion of an unfortunate who is but too little de&s;erving of it."</P>
<P>She put her handkerchief to her eyes; her cowl was only half drawn over her face. Ambro&s;io ob&s;erved that &s;he was pale, and her eyes &s;unk and heavy.</P>
<P>"Good God!" he cried, "you are very ill, Matilda; I &s;hall &s;end father Pablos to you in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>"No, do not; I am ill, 'tis true, but he cannot cure my malady. Farewell, father! Remember me in your prayers to-morrow, while I &s;hall remember you in heaven."</P>
<P>She entered her cell, and clo&s;ed the door.</P>
<P>The abbot di&s;patched to her the phy&s;i|cian without lo&s;ing a moment, and waited his report impatiently; but father Pablos
<PB N="152" REF="158">
&s;oon returned, and declared that his errand had been fruitle&s;s. Ro&s;ario refu&s;ed to ad|mit him, and had po&s;itively rejected his of|fers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The unea&s;ine&s;s which this account gave Ambro&s;io was not trifling; yet he determined that Matilda &s;hould have her own way for that night; but that, if her &s;ituation did not mend by the morning, he would in&s;i&s;t upon her taking the advice of father Pablos.</P>
<P>He did not find him&s;elf inclined to &s;leep; he opened his ca&s;ement, and gazed upon the moon-beams as they played upon the &s;mall &s;tream who&s;e waters bathed the walls of the mona&s;tery. The coolne&s;s of the night breeze, and tranquillity of the hour, in&s;pired the friar's mind with &s;adne&s;s; he thought upon Matilda's beauty and affection; upon the plea&s;ures which he might have &s;hared with her, had he not been re&s;trained by mona&s;tic &s;etters. He reflected that, un&s;u&s;tained by hope, her love for him could not long exi&s;t; that doubtle&s;s &s;he would &s;ucceed in extin|gui&s;hing her pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eek for happine&s;s
<PB N="153" REF="159">
in the arms of one more fortunate. He &s;hud|dered at the void which her ab&s;ence would leave in his bo&s;om; he looked with di&s;gu&s;t on the monotony of a convent, and breathed a &s;igh towards that world from which he was for ever &s;eparated. Such were the reflec|tions which a loud knocking at his door in|terrupted. The bell of the church had al|ready &s;truck two. The abbot ha&s;tened to enquire the cau&s;e of this di&s;turbance. He opened the door of his cell, and a lay-bro|ther entered, who&s;e looks declared his hurry and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Ha&s;ten, reverend father!" &s;aid he, "ha&s;ten to the young Ro&s;ario: he earne&s;tly reque&s;ts to &s;ee you; he lies at the point of death."</P>
<P>"Gracious God! where is father Pa|blos? Why is he not with him? Oh! I fear, I fear&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Father Pablos has &s;een him, but his art can do nothing. He &s;ays that he &s;u&s;|pects the youth to be poi&s;oned."</P>
<P>"Poi&s;oned? Oh! the unfortunate! It is
<PB N="154" REF="160">
then as I &s;u&s;pected! But let me not lo&s;e a moment; perhaps it may yet be time to &s;ave her."</P>
<P>He &s;aid, and flew towards the cell of the novice. Several monks were already in the chamber; father Pablos was one of them, and held a medicine in his hand, which he was endeavouring to per&s;uade Ro&s;ario to &s;wallow. The others were em|ployed in admiring the patient's divine countenance, which they now &s;aw for the fir&s;t time. She looked lovelier than ever; &s;he was no longer pale or languid; a bright glow had &s;pread it&s;elf over her cheeks; her eyes &s;parkled with a &s;erene delight, and her countenance was expre&s;&s;ive of confidence and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>"Oh! torment me no more!" was &s;he &s;aying to Pablos, when the terrified abbot ru&s;hed ha&s;tily into the cell; "my di&s;ea&s;e is far beyond the reach of your &s;kill, and I wi&s;h not to be cured of it." Then per|ceiving Ambro&s;io&mdash;"Ah, 'tis he!" &s;he cried; "I &s;ee him once again before we part for
<PB N="155" REF="161">
ever! Leave me, my brethren; much have I to tell this holy man in private."</P>
<P>The monks retired immediately, and Ma|tilda and the abbot remained together.</P>
<P>"What have you done, imprudent wo|man?" exclaimed the latter, as &s;oon as they were left alone: "tell me; are my &s;u&s;pi|cions ju&s;t? Am I indeed to lo&s;e you? Has your own hand been the in&s;trument of your de&s;truction?"</P>
<P>She &s;miled, and gra&s;ped his hand.</P>
<P>"In what have I been imprudent, father? I have &s;acrificed a pebble, and &s;aved a dia|mond. My death pre&s;erves a life valua|ble to the world, and more dear to me than my own.&mdash;Yes, father, I am poi&s;oned; but know, that the poi&s;on once circulated in your veins."</P>
<P>"Matilda!"</P>
<P>"What I tell you I re&s;olved never to di&s;cover to you but on the bed of death; that moment is now arrived. You cannot have forgotten the day already, when your life was endangered by the bite of a cienti|pedoro.
<PB N="156" REF="162">
The phy&s;ician gave you over, de|claring him&s;elf ignorant how to extract the venom. I knew but of one means, and he|&s;itated not a moment to employ it. I was left alone with you; you &s;lept; I loo&s;ened the bandage from your hand; I ki&s;&s;ed the wound, and drew out the poi&s;on with my lips. The effect has been more &s;udden than I expected. I feel death at my heart; yet an hour, and I &s;hall be in a better world."</P>
<P>"Almighty God!" exclaimed the abbot, and &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s upon the bed.</P>
<P>After a few minutes he again rai&s;ed him|&s;elf up &s;uddenly, and gazed upon Matilda with all the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"And you have &s;acrificed your&s;elf for me! You die, and die to pre&s;erve Ambro|&s;io! And is there indeed no remedy, Ma|tilda? And is there indeed no hope? Speak to me, oh! &s;peak to me! Tell me that you have &s;till the means of life!"</P>
<P>"Be comforted, my only friend! Yes, I have &s;till the means of life in my power; but it is a means which I dare not employ;
<PB N="157" REF="163">
it is dangerous; it is dreadful! Life would be purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate,&mdash;unle&s;s it were permitted me to live for you."</P>
<P>"Then live for me, Matilda; for me and gratitude!"&mdash;(He caught her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it rapturou&s;ly to his lips.)&mdash;"Re|member our late conver&s;ations; I now con|&s;ent to every thing. Remember in what lively colours you de&s;cribed the union of &s;ouls; be it ours to realize tho&s;e ideas. Let us forget the di&s;tinctions of &s;ex, de&s;pi&s;e the world's prejudices, and only con&s;ider each other as brother and friend. Live then, Matilda, oh! live for me!"</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io, it mu&s;t not be. When I thought thus, I deceived both you and my|&s;elf: either I mu&s;t die at pre&s;ent, or expire by the lingering torments of un&s;atisfied de|&s;ire. Oh! &s;ince we la&s;t conver&s;ed together, a dreadful veil has been rent from before my eyes. I love you no longer with the de|votion which is paid to a &s;aint; I prize you no more for the virtues of your &s;oul; I lu&s;t for the enjoyment of your per&s;on. The wo|man
<PB N="158" REF="164">
reigns in my bo&s;om, and I am become a prey to the wilde&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions. Away with friend&s;hip! 'tis a cold unfeeling word: my bo&s;om burns with love, with unutterable love, and love mu&s;t be its return. Tremble then, Ambro&s;io, tremble to &s;ucceed in your prayers. If I live, your truth, your reputa|tion, your reward of a life pa&s;t in &s;ufferings, all that you value, is irretrievably lo&s;t. I &s;hall no longer be able to combat my pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;hall &s;eize every opportunity to excite your de&s;ires, and labour to effect your di&s;|honour and my own. No, no, Ambro&s;io, I mu&s;t not live; I am convinced with every moment that I have but one alternative; I feel with every heart throb, that I mu&s;t en|joy you or die."</P>
<P>"Amazement! Matilda! Can it be you who &s;peak to me?"</P>
<P>He made a movement as if to quit his feat. She uttered a loud &s;hriek, and, rai&s;ing her&s;elf half out of the bed, threw her arms round the friar to detain him.</P>
<P>"Oh! do not leave me! Li&s;ten to my
<PB N="159" REF="165">
errors with compa&s;&s;ion: in a few hours I &s;hall be no more: yet a little, and I am free from this di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Wretched woman, what can I &s;ay to you? I cannot&mdash;I mu&s;t not&mdash;But live, Matilda! oh, live!"</P>
<P>"You do not reflect on what you a&s;k. What? live to plunge my&s;elf in infamy? to become the agent of hell? to work the de&s;truction both of you and of my&s;elf? Feel this heart, father."</P>
<P>She took his hand. Confu&s;ed, embar|ra&s;&s;ed, and fa&s;cinated, he withdrew it not, and felt her heart throb under it.</P>
<P>"Feel this heart, father! It is yet the &s;eat of honour, truth, and cha&s;tity: if it beats to-morrow, it mu&s;t fall a prey to the blacke&s;t crimes. Oh, let me then die to-day! Let me die while I yet de&s;erve the tears of the virtuous. Thus will I expire!"&mdash;(She re|clined her head upon his &s;houlder; her golden hair poured it&s;elf over his che&s;t.)&mdash; "Folded in your arms, I &s;hall &s;ink to &s;leep; your hand &s;hall clo&s;e my eyes for ever, and
<PB N="160" REF="166">
your lips receive my dying breath. And will you not &s;ometimes think of me? Will you not &s;ometimes &s;hed a tear upon my tomb? Oh, yes, yes, yes! that ki&s;s is my a&s;&s;urance."</P>
<P>The hour was night. All was &s;ilence around. The faint beams of a &s;olitary lamp darted upon Matilda's figure, and &s;hed through the chamber a dim, my&s;terious light. No prying eye or curious ear was near the lovers: nothing was heard but Ma|tilda's melodious accents. Ambro&s;io was in the full vigour of manhood; he &s;aw be|fore him a young and beautiful woman, the pre&s;erver of his life, the adorer of his per|&s;on; and whom affection for him had re|duced to the brink of the grave. He &s;at upon her bed; his hand re&s;ted upon her bo&s;om; her head reclined voluptuou&s;ly upon his brea&s;t. Who then can wonder if he yielded to the temptation? Drunk with de&s;ire, he pre&s;&s;ed his lips to tho&s;e which &s;ought them; his ki&s;&s;es vied with Matilda's in warmth and pa&s;&s;ion: he cla&s;ped her rap|turou&s;ly
<PB N="161" REF="167">
in his arms; he forgot his vows, his &s;anctity, and his fame; he remembered nothing but the plea&s;ure and opportunity.</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io! Oh, my Ambro&s;io!" &s;ighed Matilda.</P>
<P>"Thine, ever thine," murmured the friar, and &s;unk upon her bo&s;om.</P>

<P>THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in &s;ilence. The former employ|ed him&s;elf in calling every circum&s;tance to his mind, which related might give Loren|zo's the mo&s;t favourable idea of his con|nexion with Agnes. The latter, ju&s;tly alarmed for the honour of his family, felt embarra&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of the marquis: the adventure which he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed forbad his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's intere&s;ts being entru&s;ted to his mediation, he &s;aw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from the&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="169">
reflections, that profound &s;ilence would be the wi&s;e&s;t plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation.</P>
<P>They arrived at the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to expre&s;s his &s;atisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lo|renzo interrupted him.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, my lord," &s;aid he with a di&s;tant air, "if I reply &s;omewhat coldly to your expre&s;&s;ions of regard. A &s;i&s;ter's honour is involved in this affair: till that is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and the purport of your corre&s;pon|dence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot con|&s;ider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the meaning of your conduct; and hope that you will not delay the promi&s;ed explanation."</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t give me your word, that you will li&s;ten with patience and indulgence."</P>
<P>"I love my &s;i&s;ter too well to judge her har&s;hly; and, till this moment, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no friend &s;o dear to me as your&s;elf. I will al&s;o confe&s;s, that your having it in your power
<PB N="164" REF="170">
to oblige me in a bu&s;ine&s;s which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you &s;till de&s;erving my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"Lorenzo, you tran&s;port me! No greater plea&s;ure can be given me, than an opportunity of &s;erving the brother of Agnes."</P>
<P>"Convince me that I can accept your favours without di&s;honour, and there is no man in the world to whom I am more willing to be obliged."</P>
<P>"Probably you have already heard your &s;i&s;ter mention the name of Alphon&s;o d'Al|varada?"</P>
<P>"Never. Though I feel for Agnes an affection truly fraternal, circum&s;tances have prevented us from being much together. While yet a child, &s;he was con&s;igned to the care of her aunt, who had married a Ger|man nobleman. At his ca&s;tle &s;he remained till two years &s;ince, when &s;he returned to Spain, determined upon &s;ecluding her&s;elf from the world."</P>
<P>"Good God! Lorenzo, you knew of her
<PB N="165" REF="171">
intention, and yet &s;trove not to make her change it?"</P>
<P>"Marquis, you wrong me: the intelli|gence which I received at Naples &s;hocked me extremely, and I ha&s;tened my return to Madrid for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of prevent|ing the &s;acrifice. The moment that I ar|rived, I flew to the convent of St. Clare, in which Agnes had cho&s;en to perform her noviciate. I reque&s;ted to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter. Conceive my &s;urpri&s;e, when &s;he &s;ent me a refu&s;al: &s;he declared po&s;itively that, appre|hending my influence over her mind, &s;he would not tru&s;t her&s;elf in my &s;ociety, 'till the day before that on which &s;he was to re|ceive the veil. I &s;upplicated the nuns; I in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing Agnes; and he&s;itated not to avow my &s;u&s;picions, that her being kept from me was again&s;t her own inclina|tions. To free her&s;elf from the imputation of violence, the priore&s;s brought me a few lines, written in my &s;i&s;ter's well-known hand, repeating the me&s;&s;age already deliver|ed. All future attempts to obtain a mo|ment's
<PB N="166" REF="172">
conver&s;ation with her were as fruit|le&s;s as the fir&s;t. She was inflexible, and I was not permitted to &s;ee her till the day preceding that on which &s;he entered the cloi&s;ter, never to quit it more. This inter|view took place in the pre&s;ence of our prin|cipal relations. It was for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her childhood that I &s;aw her, and the &s;cene was mo&s;t affecting: &s;he threw her&s;elf upon my bo&s;om, ki&s;&s;ed me, and wept bitterly. By every po&s;&s;ible argument, by tears, by prayers, by kneeling, I &s;trove to make her abandon her intention. I repre&s;ented to her all the hard&s;hips of a religious life; I painted to her imagination all the plea&s;ures which &s;he was going to quit; and be&s;ought her to di&s;clo&s;e to me what occa&s;ioned her di&s;gu&s;t to the world. At this la&s;t que&s;tion &s;he turned pale, and her tears flowed yet fa&s;ter. She entreated me not to pre&s;s her on that &s;ubject; that it &s;ufficed me to know that her re&s;olution was taken, and that a convent was the only place where &s;he could now hope for tranquillity. She per&s;evered in
<PB N="167" REF="173">
her de&s;ign, and made her profe&s;&s;ion. I vi|&s;ited her frequently at the grate; and every moment that I pa&s;&s;ed with her made me feel more affliction at her lo&s;s. I was &s;hortly after obliged to quit Madrid; I returned but ye&s;terday evening, and, &s;ince then, have not had time to call at St. Clare's convent."</P>
<P>"Then, till I mentioned it, you never heard the name of Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me: my aunt wrote me word, that an adventurer &s;o called had found means to get introduced into the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg; that he had in&s;inuated him|&s;elf into my &s;i&s;ter's good graces; and that &s;he had even con&s;ented to elope with him. However, before the plan could be execu|ted, the cavalier di&s;covered, that the e&s;tates which he believed Agnes to po&s;&s;e&s;s in Hi&s;|paniola, in reality belonged to me. This intelligence made him change his intention; he di&s;appeared on the day that the elope|ment was to have taken place; and Agnes, in de&s;pair at his perfidy and meanne&s;s, had re&s;olved upon &s;eclu&s;ion in a convent. She

added, that as this adventurer had given him&s;elf out to be a friend of mine, &s;he wi&s;h|ed to know whether I had any knowledge of him. I replied in the negative. I had then very little idea, that Alphon&s;o d'Alva|rada and the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas were one and the &s;ame per&s;on: the de&s;cription given me of the fir&s;t, by no means tallied with what I knew of the latter."</P>
<P>"In this I ea&s;ily recognize Donna Ro|dopha's perfidious character.

<HEAD>HISTORY OF DON RAYMOND, MARQUIS DE LAS CISTERNAS.</HEAD>
<P>LONG experience, my dear Lorenzo, has convinced me how generous is your nature: I waited not for your declaration of ignorance re&s;pecting your &s;i&s;ter's adven|tures, to &s;uppo&s;e that they had been pur|po&s;ely concealed from you. Had they reached your knowledge, from what mi&s;|fortunes &s;hould both Agnes and my&s;elf have e&s;caped! Fate had ordained it otherwi&s;e. You were on your travels when I fir&s;t be|came acquainted with your &s;i&s;ter; and as our enemies took care to conceal from her your direction, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to implore by letter your protection and ad|vice.</P>
<P>On leaving Salamanca, at which uni|ver&s;ity, as I have &s;ince heard, you remained a year after I quitted it, I immediately &s;et
<PB N="170" REF="176">
out upon my travels. My father &s;upplied me liberally with money; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon my concealing my rank, and pre&s;ent|ing my&s;elf as no more than a private gentle|man. This command was i&s;&s;ued by the coun&s;els of his friend the duke of Villa Hermo&s;a, a nobleman for who&s;e abilities and knowledge of the world I have ever entertained the mo&s;t profound veneration.</P>
<P>"Believe me," &s;aid he, "my dear Ray|mond, you will hereafter feel the benefits of this temporary degradation. 'Tis true, that as the cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas you would have been received with open arms, and your youthful vanity might have felt gratified by the attentions &s;howered upon you from all &s;ides. At pre&s;ent, much will depend upon your&s;elf; you have excellent recommendations, but it mu&s;t be your own bu&s;ine&s;s to make them of u&s;e to you: you mu&s;t lay your&s;elf out to plea&s;e; you mu&s;t labour to gain the approbation of tho&s;e to whom you are pre&s;ented: they who would
<PB N="171" REF="177">
have courted the friend&s;hip of the cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas will have no intere&s;t in finding out the merits, or bearing patiently with the faults, of Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada: con&s;equently, when you find your&s;elf really liked, you may &s;afely a&s;cribe it to your good qualities, not your rank; and the di&s;tinc|tion &s;hewn you will be infinitely more flat|tering. Be&s;ides, your exalted birth would not permit your mixing with the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, which will now be in your power, and from which, in my opi|nion, you will derive con&s;iderable benefit. Do not confine your&s;elf to the illu&s;trious of tho&s;e countries through which you pa&s;s. Examine the manners and cu&s;toms of the multitude: enter into the cottages; and, by ob&s;erving how the va&s;&s;als of foreigners are treated, learn to dimini&s;h the burthens, and augment the comforts, of your own. According to my ideas of tho&s;e advantages which a youth de&s;tined to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power and wealth may reap from travel, he &s;hould not con&s;ider as the lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential,
<PB N="172" REF="178">
the opportunity of mixing with the cla&s;&s;es below him, and becoming an eye-witne&s;s of the &s;ufferings of the people."</P>
<P>Forgive me, Lorenzo, if I &s;eem tedious in my narration: the clo&s;e connexion which now exi&s;ts between us, makes me anxious that you &s;hould know every particular re|&s;pecting me; and in my fear of omitting the lea&s;t circum&s;tance which may induce you to think favourably of your &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf, I may po&s;&s;ibly relate many which you may think unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>I followed the duke's advice; I was &s;oon convinced of its wi&s;dom. I quitted Spain, calling my&s;elf by the a&s;&s;umed title of Don Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada, and attended by a &s;ingle dome&s;tic of approved fidelity. Paris was my fir&s;t &s;tation. For &s;ome time I was enchanted with it, as indeed mu&s;t be every man who is young, rich, and fond of plea&s;ure. Yet, among all its gaieties, I felt that &s;omething was wanting to my heart: I grew &s;ick of di&s;&s;ipation: I di&s;covered that the people among whom I lived, and who&s;e
<PB N="173" REF="179">
exterior was &s;o poli&s;hed and &s;educing, were at bottom frivolous, unfeeling, and in&s;incere. I turned from the inhabitants of Paris with di&s;gu&s;t, and quitted that theatre of luxury without heaving one &s;igh of regret.</P>
<P>I now bent my cour&s;e towards Ger|many, intending to vi&s;it mo&s;t of the prin|cipal courts. Prior to this expedition, I meant to make &s;ome little &s;tay at Stra&s;bourg. On quitting my chai&s;e at Luneville, to take &s;ome refre&s;hment, I ob&s;erved a &s;plendid equipage, attended by four dome&s;tics in rich liveries, waiting at the door of the Sil|ver Lion. Soon after, as I looked out of the window, I &s;aw a lady of noble pre&s;ence, followed by two female attendants, &s;tep into the carriage, which drove off immediately.</P>
<P>I enquired of the ho&s;t who the lady was that had ju&s;t departed.</P>
<P>"A German barone&s;s, mon&s;ieur, of great rank and fortune; &s;he has been upon a vi&s;it to the duche&s;s of Longueville, as her &s;er|vants informed me. She is going to Stra&s;|bourg, where &s;he will find her hu&s;band, and
<PB N="174" REF="180">
then both return to their ca&s;tle in Ger|many."</P>
<P>I re&s;umed my journey, intending to reach Stra&s;bourg that night. My hopes, however, were fru&s;trated by the breaking down of my chai&s;e: the accident happened in the middle of a thick fore&s;t, and I was not a little embarra&s;&s;ed as to the means of pro|ceeding. It was the depth of winter; the night was already clo&s;ing round us; and Stra&s;bourg, which was the neare&s;t town, was &s;till di&s;tant from us &s;everal leagues. It &s;eemed to me that my only alternative to pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t, was to take my &s;ervant's hor&s;e and ride on to Stra&s;|bourg; an undertaking at that &s;ea&s;on very far from agreeable. However, &s;eeing no other re&s;ource, I was obliged to make up my mind to it: accordingly, I communi|cated my de&s;ign to the po&s;tillion, telling him that I would &s;end people to a&s;&s;i&s;t him as &s;oon as I reached Stra&s;bourg. I had not much confidence in his hone&s;ty; but Stephano being well armed, and the driver, to all ap|pearance,
<PB N="175" REF="181">
con&s;iderably advanced in years, I believed I ran no ri&s;k of lo&s;ing my baggage.</P>
<P>Luckily, as I then thought, an oppor|tunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf of pa&s;&s;ing the night more agreeably than I expected. On men|tioning my de&s;ign of proceeding by my&s;elf to Stra&s;bourg, the po&s;tillion &s;hook his head in di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>"It is a long way," &s;aid he; "you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there with|out a guide: be&s;ides, mon&s;ieur &s;eems unac|cu&s;tomed to the &s;ea&s;on's &s;everity; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible that, unable to &s;u&s;tain the exce&s;&s;ive cold&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What u&s;e is there to pre&s;ent me with all the&s;e objections?" &s;aid I, impatiently in|terrupting him: "I have no other re&s;ource; I run &s;till greater ri&s;k of peri&s;hing with cold by pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t."</P>
<P>"Pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t?" he replied. "Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite &s;o bad a plight as that comes to yet. If I am not mi&s;taken, we are &s;carcely five mi|nutes walk from the cottage of my old friend
<PB N="176" REF="182">
Bapti&s;te: he is a wood-cutter, and a very hone&s;t fellow. I doubt not but he will &s;hel|ter you for the night with plea&s;ure. In the mean time, I can take the &s;addle-hor&s;e, ride to Stra&s;bourg, and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day."</P>
<P>"And, in the name of God," &s;aid I, "how could you leave me &s;o long in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e? Why did you not tell me of this cottage &s;ooner? What exce&s;&s;ive &s;tupidity!"</P>
<P>"I thought, that perhaps mon&s;ieur would not deign to accept&mdash;&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd! Come, come; &s;ay no more, but conduct us without delay to the wood|man's cottage."</P>
<P>He obeyed, and we moved onwards: the hor&s;es contrived, with &s;ome difficulty&punc; to drag the &s;hattered vehicle after us. My &s;ervant was become almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s, and I began to feel the effects of the cold my&s;elf before we reached the wi&s;hed-for cottage. It was a &s;mall but neat building: as we drew near it, I rejoiced at ob&s;erving through the win|dow
<PB N="177" REF="183">
the blaze of a comfortable fire. Our conductor knocked at the door: it was &s;ome time before any one an&s;wered; the people within &s;eemed in doubt whether we &s;hould be admitted.</P>
<P>"Come, come, friend Bapti&s;te!" cried the driver with impatience, "what are you about? Are you a&s;leep? Or will you re|fu&s;e a night's lodging to a gentleman, who&s;e chai&s;e has ju&s;t broken down in the fore&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Ah! is it you, hone&s;t Claude?" replied a man's voice from within: "wait a mo|ment, and the door &s;hall be opened."</P>
<P>Soon after the bolts were drawn back; the door was unclo&s;ed, and a man pre&s;ented him&s;elf to us with a lamp in his hand: he gave the guide an hearty reception, and then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me:</P>
<P>"Walk in, mon&s;ieur; walk in, and wel|come. Excu&s;e me for not admitting you at fir&s;t; but there are &s;o many rogues about this place that, &s;aving your pre&s;ence, I &s;u&s;|pected you to be one."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he u&s;hered me into the
<PB N="178" REF="184">
room where I had ob&s;erved the fire. I was immediately placed in an ea&s;y chair, which &s;tood clo&s;e to the hearth. A female, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the wife of my ho&s;t, ro&s;e from her &s;eat upon my entrance, and receiv|ed me with a &s;light and di&s;tant reverence. She made no an&s;wer to my compliment, but, immediately re-&s;eating her&s;elf, continu|ed the work on which &s;he had been em|ployed. Her hu&s;band's manners were as friendly as hers were har&s;h and repul&s;ive.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h I could lodge you more conve|niently, mon&s;ieur," &s;aid he, "but we cannot boa&s;t of much &s;pare room in this hovel. How|ever, a chamber for your&s;elf and another for your &s;ervant, I think, we can make &s;hift to &s;upply. You mu&s;t content your&s;elf with &s;orry fare; but to what we have, believe me, you are heartily welcome."&mdash;&mdash;Then, turning to his wife&mdash;"Why, how you &s;it there, Marguerite, with as much tranquillity as if you had nothing better to do! Stir about, dame! &s;tir about! Get &s;ome &s;upper; look out &s;ome &s;heets. Here, here! throw
<PB N="179" REF="185">
&s;ome logs upon the fire, for the gentleman &s;eems peri&s;hed with cold."</P>
<P>The wife threw her work ha&s;tily upon the table, and proceeded to execute his commands with every mark of unwilling|ne&s;s. Her countenance had di&s;plea&s;ed me on the fir&s;t moment of my examining it: yet, upon the whole, her features were hand|&s;ome unque&s;tionably; but her &s;kin was &s;al|low, and her per&s;on thin and meagre: a louring gloom over&s;pread her countenance, and it bore &s;uch vi&s;ible marks of rancour and ill-will, as could not e&s;cape being no|ticed by the mo&s;t inattentive ob&s;erver: her every look and action expre&s;&s;ed di&s;content and impatience; and the an&s;wers which &s;he gave Bapti&s;te, when he reproached her good-humouredly for her di&s;&s;atisfied air, were tart, &s;hort, and cutting. In fine, I con|ceived at fir&s;t &s;ight equal di&s;gu&s;t for her, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of her hu&s;band, who&s;e appearance was calculated to in&s;pire e&s;teem and confidence. His countenance was open, &s;incere, and friendly; his man|ners
<PB N="180" REF="186">
had all the pea&s;ant's hone&s;ty, unac|companied by his rudene&s;s: his checks were broad, full, and ruddy; and in the &s;olidity of his per&s;on he &s;eemed to offer an ample apology for the leanne&s;s of his wife's. From the wrinkles on his brow, I judged him to be turned of &s;ixty; but he bore his years well, and &s;eemed &s;till hearty and &s;trong. The wife could not be more than thirty, but in &s;pirits and vivacity &s;he was infinitely older than the hu&s;band.</P>
<P>However, in &s;pite of her unwillingne&s;s, Marguerite began to prepare the &s;upper, while the woodman converted gaily on dif|ferent &s;ubjects. The po&s;tillion, who had been furni&s;hed with a bottle of &s;pirits, was now ready to &s;et out for Stra&s;bourg, and en|quired whether I had any further com|mands.</P>
<P>"For Stra&s;bourg?" interrupted Bapti&s;te; "you are not going thither to-night?"</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon: if I do not fetch workmen to mend the chai&s;e, how is mon|&s;ieur to proceed to-morrow?"</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="187">"That is true, as you &s;ay, I had forgot|ten the chai&s;e. Well, but Claude, you may at lea&s;t eat your &s;upper here? That can make you lo&s;e very little time; and mon&s;ieur looks too kind-hearted to &s;end you out with an empty &s;tomach on &s;uch a bitter cold night as this is."</P>
<P>To this I readily a&s;&s;ented, telling the po&s;til|lion that my reaching Stra&s;bourg the next day an hour or two later would be perfectly im|material. He thanked me, and then leaving the cottage with Stephano, put up his hor&s;es in the woodman's &s;table. Bapti&s;te followed them to the door, and looked out with anxiety.</P>
<P>"'Tis a &s;harp, biting wind," &s;aid he: "I wonder what detains my boys &s;o long! Mon&s;ieur, I &s;hall &s;hew you two of the fine&s;t lads that ever &s;tepped in &s;hoe of leather: the elde&s;t is three-and-twenty, the &s;econd a year younger: their equals for &s;en&s;e, courage, and activity, are not to be found within fif|ty miles of Stra&s;bourg. Would they were
<PB N="182" REF="188">
back again! I begin to feel unea&s;y about them."</P>
<P>Marguerite was at this time employed in laying the cloth.</P>
<P>"And are you equally anxious for the return of your &s;ons?" &s;aid I to her.</P>
<P>"Not I," &s;he replied peevi&s;hly; "they are no children of mine."</P>
<P>"Come, come, Marguerite!" &s;aid the hu&s;band, "do not be out of humour with the gentleman for a&s;king a &s;imple que&s;|tion: had you not looked &s;o cro&s;s, he would never have thought you old enough to have a &s;on of three-and-twenty; but you &s;ee how many years ill-temper adds to you!&mdash;Ex|cu&s;e my wife's rudene&s;s, mon&s;ieur; a little thing puts her out; and &s;he is &s;omewhat di&s;plea&s;ed at your not thinking her to be under thirty.&mdash;That is the truth, is it not, Marguerite? You know, mon&s;ieur, that age is always a tickli&s;h &s;ubject with a wo|man. Come, come, Marguerite! clear up a little. If you have not &s;ons as old, you will
<PB N="183" REF="189">
&s;ome twenty years hence; and I hope that we &s;hall live to &s;ee them ju&s;t &s;uch lads as Jacques and Robert."</P>
<P>Marguerite cla&s;ped her hands together pa&s;&s;ionately.</P>
<P>"God forbid!" &s;aid &s;he, "God forbid! If I thought it, I would &s;trangle them with my own hands."</P>
<P>She quitted the room ha&s;tily, and went up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I could not help expre&s;&s;ing to the wood|man how much I pitied him for being chain|ed for life to a partner of &s;uch ill-humour.</P>
<P>"Ah, Lord! mon&s;ieur, every one has his &s;hare of grievances, and Marguerite has fallen to mine. Be&s;ides, after all, &s;he is only cro&s;s, and not malicious: the wor&s;t is, that her affection for two children by a former hu&s;band, makes her play the &s;tep-mother with my two &s;ons; &s;he cannot bear the &s;ight of them; and, by her good will, they would never &s;et a foot within my door. But on this point I always &s;tand firm, and never will con&s;ent to abandon the poor lads to the
<PB N="184" REF="190">
world's mercy, as &s;he has often &s;olicited me to do. In every thing el&s;e I let her have her own way; and truly &s;he manages a fa|mily rarely, that I mu&s;t &s;ay for her."</P>
<P>We were conver&s;ing in this manner, when our di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by a loud halloo, which rang through the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>"My &s;ons, I hope!" exclaimed the woodman, and ran to open the door.</P>
<P>The halloo was repeated. We now di&s;|tingui&s;hed the trampling of hor&s;es; and, &s;oon after, a carriage attended by &s;everal cavaliers &s;topped at the cottage door. One of the hor&s;emen enquired how far they were &s;till from Stra&s;bourg. As he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, I an&s;wered in the number of miles which Claude had told me; upon which a volley of cur&s;es was vented again&s;t the drivers for having lo&s;t their way. The per&s;ons in the coach were now informed of the di&s;tance of Stra&s;bourg; and al&s;o that the hor&s;es were &s;o fatigued as to be incapa|ble of proceeding further. A lady, who ap|peared
<PB N="185" REF="191">
to be the principal, expre&s;&s;ed much chagrin at this intelligence; but as there was no remedy, one of the attendants a&s;ked the woodman whether he could furni&s;h them with lodging for the night.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed much embarra&s;&s;ed, and re|plied in the negative; adding, that a Spani&s;h gentleman and his &s;ervant were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only &s;pare apartments in his hou&s;e. On hearing this, the gallantry of my nation would not permit me to re|tain tho&s;e accommodations of which a fe|male was in want. I in&s;tantly &s;ignified to the woodman, that I transferred my right to the lady: he made &s;ome objections, but I over-ruled them, and, ha&s;tening to the car|riage, opened the door, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the lady to de&s;cend. I immediately recognized her for the &s;ame per&s;on whom I had &s;een at the inn at Luneville. I took an opportunity of a&s;king one of her attendants what was her name?</P>
<P>"The barone&s;s Lindenberg," was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="192">I could not but remark how different a reception our ho&s;t had given the&s;e new-comers and my&s;elf. His reluctance to admit them was vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed on his counte|nance; and he prevailed on him&s;elf with difficulty to tell the lady that &s;he was wel|come. I conducted her into the hou&s;e, and placed her in the arm-chair which I had ju&s;t quitted. She thanked me very gra|ciou&s;ly, and made a thou&s;and apologies for putting me to an inconvenience. Suddenly the woodman's countenance cleared up.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t I have arranged it!" &s;aid he, interrupting her excu&s;es. "I can lodge you and your &s;uite, madam, and you will not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of making this gentleman &s;uffer for his politene&s;s. We have two &s;pare chambers, one for the lady, the other, mon&s;ieur, for you: my wife &s;hall give up hers to the two waiting-women: as for the men &s;ervants, they mu&s;t content them&s;elves with pa&s;&s;ing the night in a large barn, which &s;tands at a few yards di&s;tance from the hou&s;e; there they &s;hall have a blazing fire, and as
<PB N="187" REF="193">
good a &s;upper as we can make &s;hift to give them."</P>
<P>After &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude on the lady's part, and oppo&s;ition on mine to Marguerite's giving up her bed, this ar|rangement was agreed to. As the room was &s;mall, the barone&s;s immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her male dome&s;tics. Bapti&s;te was on the point of conducting them to the barn which he had mentioned, when two young men appeared at the door of the cottage.</P>
<P>"Hell and furies!" exclaimed the fir&s;t, &s;tarting back, "Robert, the hou&s;e is filled with &s;trangers!"</P>
<P>"Ha! there are my &s;ons!" cried our ho&s;t. "Why, Jacques! Robert! whither are you running, boys? There is room enough &s;till for you."</P>
<P>Upon this a&s;&s;urance the youths return|ed. The father pre&s;ented them to the ba|rone&s;s and my&s;elf; after which he withdrew with our dome&s;tics, while, at the reque&s;t of the two waiting-women, Marguerite con|ducted
<PB N="188" REF="194">
them to the room de&s;igned for their mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The two new-comers were tall, &s;tout, well-made young men, hard-featured, and very much &s;un-burnt. They paid their compliments to us in few words, and acknowledged Claude, who now entered the room, as an old acquaintance. They then threw a&s;ide their cloaks in which they were wrapped up, took off a leathern belt to which a large cutla&s;s was &s;u&s;pended, and each drawing a brace of pi&s;tols from his girdle laid them upon a &s;helf.</P>
<P>"You travel well armed," &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"True, mon&s;ieur," replied Robert.&mdash;</P>
<P>"We left Stra&s;bourg late this evening, and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to take precautions at pa&s;&s;ing through this fore&s;t after dark; it does not bear a good repute, I promi&s;e you."</P>
<P>"How?" &s;aid the barone&s;s, "are there robbers hereabout?"</P>
<P>"So it is &s;aid, madame: for my own part, I have travelled through the wood at
<PB N="189" REF="195">
all hours, and never met with one of them."</P>
<P>Here Marguerite returned. Her &s;tep|&s;ons drew her to the other end of the room, and whi&s;pered her for &s;ome minutes. By the looks which they ca&s;t towards us at in|tervals, I conjectured them to be enquiring our bu&s;ine&s;s in the cottage.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the barone&s;s ex|pre&s;&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions that her hu&s;band would be &s;uffering much anxiety upon her account. She had intended to &s;end on one of her &s;ervants to inform the baron of her delay; but the account which the young men gave of the fore&s;t rendered this plan impracticable. Claude relieved her from her embarra&s;&s;ment: he informed her, that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of reaching Stra&s;|bourg that night; and that, would &s;he tru&s;t him with a letter, &s;he might depend upon its being &s;afely delivered.</P>
<P>"And how comes it," &s;aid I, "that you are under no apprehen&s;ion of meeting the&s;e robbers?"</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">"Alas! mon&s;ieur, a poor man with a large family mu&s;t not lo&s;e certain profit be|cau&s;e 'tis attended with a little danger; and perhaps my lord the baron may give me a trifle for my pains: be&s;ides, I have nothing to lo&s;e except my life, and that will not be worth the robbers taking."</P>
<P>I thought his arguments bad, and ad|vi&s;ed his waiting till the morning; but, as the barone&s;s did not &s;econd me, I was obliged to give up the point. The barone&s;s Lin|denberg, as I found afterwards, had long been accu&s;tomed to &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of others to her own, and her wi&s;h to &s;end Claude to Stra&s;bourg blinded her to the danger of the undertaking. Accordingly, it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;et out without delay. The barone&s;s wrote her letter to her hu&s;band; and I &s;ent a few lines to my banker, appri&s;ing him that I &s;hould not be at Stra&s;|bourg till the next day. Claude took our letters, and left the cottage.</P>
<P>The lady declared her&s;elf much fa|tigued by her journey: be&s;ides having
<PB N="191" REF="197">
come from &s;ome di&s;tance, the drivers had contrived to lo&s;e their way in the fore&s;t. She now addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Marguerite, de|&s;iring to be &s;hewn to her chamber, and permitted to take half an hour's repo&s;e. One of the waiting-women was immediately &s;um|moned; &s;he appeared with a light, and the barone&s;s followed her up &s;tairs. The cloth was &s;preading in the chamber where I was, and Marguerite &s;oon gave me to under&s;tand that I was in her way. Her hints were too broad to be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken; I therefore de&s;ired one of the young men to conduct me to the chamber where I was to &s;leep, and where I could remain till &s;upper was ready.</P>
<P>"Which chamber is it, mother?" &s;aid Robert.</P>
<P>"The one with green hangings," &s;he replied. "I have ju&s;t been at the trouble of getting it ready, and have put fre&s;h &s;heets upon the bed: if the gentleman choo&s;es to lollop and lounge upon it, he may make it again him&s;elf, for me."</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="198">"You are out of humour, mother; but that is no novelty. Have the goodne&s;s to follow me, mon&s;ieur."</P>
<P>He opened the door, and advanced to|wards a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"You have got no light," &s;aid Margue|rite; "is it your own neck or the gentle|man's that you have a mind to break?"</P>
<P>She cro&s;&s;ed by me, and put a candle in|to Robert's hand; having received which, he began to a&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e. Jacques was employed in laying the cloth, and his back was turned towards me. Marguerite &s;eized the moment when we were unob|&s;erved: &s;he caught my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it &s;trongly.</P>
<P>"Look at the &s;heets!" &s;aid &s;he as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me, and immediately re&s;umed her former occupation.</P>
<P>Startled by the abruptne&s;s of her action, I remained as if petrified. Robert's voice de&s;iring me to follow him recalled me to my&s;elf. I a&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e. My conductor u&s;hered me into a chamber where
<PB N="193" REF="199">
an excellent wood fire was blazing upon the hearth. He placed the light upon the table, enquired whether I had any further com|mands, and, on my replying in the negative, left me to my&s;elf. You may be certain, that the moment when I found my&s;elf alone, was that on which I complied with Mar|guerite's injunction. I took the candle ha&s;tily, approached the bed, and turned down the coverture. What was my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, my horror, at finding the &s;heets crim|&s;oned with blood!</P>
<P>At that moment a thou&s;and confu&s;ed ideas pa&s;&s;ed before my imagination. The robbers who infe&s;ted the wood, Marguerite's exclamation re&s;pecting her children, the arms and appearance of the two young men, and the various anecdotes which I had heard related re&s;pecting the &s;ecret corre|&s;pondence which frequently exi&s;ts between banditti and po&s;tillions; all the&s;e circum|&s;tances fla&s;hed upon my mind, and in&s;pired me with doubt and apprehen&s;ion. I rumi|nated on the mo&s;t probable means of a&s;cer|taining
<PB N="194" REF="200">
the truth of my conjectures. Sud|denly I was aware of &s;ome one below pacing ha&s;tily backwards and forwards. Every thing now appeared to me an object of &s;u&s;|picion. With precaution I drew near the window, which, as the room had been long &s;hut up, was left open in &s;pite of the cold. I ventured to look out. The beams of the moon permitted me to di&s;tingui&s;h a man, whom I had no difficulty to recognize for my ho&s;t. I watched his movements. He walked &s;wiftly, then &s;topped and &s;eemed to li&s;ten: he &s;tamped upon the ground, and beat his &s;tomach with his arms, as if to guard him&s;elf from the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on: at the lea&s;t noi&s;e, if a voice was heard in the lower part of the hou&s;e, if a bat flitted pa&s;t him, or the wind rattled amid&s;t the leafle&s;s boughs, he &s;tarted, and looked round with anxiety.</P>
<P>"Plague take him!" &s;aid he at length with extreme impatience; "what can he be about?"</P>
<P>He &s;poke in a low voice; but as he
<PB N="195" REF="201">
was ju&s;t below my window, I had no dif|ficulty to di&s;tingui&s;h his words.</P>
<P>I now heard the &s;teps of one approach|ing. Bapti&s;te went towards the &s;ound; he joined a man, whom his low &s;tature and the horn &s;u&s;pended from his neck declared to be no other than my faithful Claude, whom I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be already on his way to Stra&s;bourg. Expecting their di&s;cour&s;e to throw &s;ome light upon my &s;ituation, I ha&s;|tened to put my&s;elf in a condition to hear it with &s;afety. For this purpo&s;e I extingui&s;hed the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndle, which &s;tood upon a table near the bed: the flame of the fire was not &s;trong enough to betray me, and I immediately re|&s;umed my place at the window.</P>
<P>The objects of my curio&s;ity had &s;ta|tioned them&s;elves directly under it. I &s;up|po&s;e that, during my momentary ab&s;ence, the woodman had been blaming Claude for tardine&s;s, &s;ince when I returned to the win|dow the latter was endeavouring to excu&s;e his fault.</P>
<P>"However," added he, "my diligence
<PB N="196" REF="202">
at pre&s;ent &s;hall make up for my pa&s;t delay."</P>
<P>"On that condition," an&s;wered Bapti&s;te, "I &s;hall readily forgive you: but in truth, as you &s;hare equally with us in our prizes, your own intere&s;t will make you u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible diligence. 'Twould be a &s;hame to let &s;uch a noble booty e&s;cape us. You &s;ay that this Spaniard is rich?"</P>
<P>"His &s;ervant boa&s;ted at the inn, that the effects in his chai&s;e were worth above two thou&s;and pi&s;toles."</P>
<P>Oh! how I cur&s;ed Stephano's imprudent vanity.</P>
<P>"And I have been told," continued the po&s;tillion, "that this barone&s;s carries about her a ca&s;ket of jewels of immen&s;e value."</P>
<P>"May be &s;o, but I had rather &s;he had &s;tayed away. The Spaniard was a &s;ecure prey; the boys and my&s;elf could ea&s;ily have ma&s;tered him and his &s;ervant, and then the two thou&s;and pi&s;toles would have been &s;hared between us four. Now we mu&s;t let in the band for a &s;hare, and perhaps the
<PB N="197" REF="203">
whole covey may e&s;cape us. Should our friends have betaken them&s;elves to their dif|ferent po&s;ts before you reach the cavern, all will be lo&s;t. The lady's attendants are too numerous for us to over power them. Unle&s;s our a&s;&s;ociates arrive in time, we mu&s;t needs let the&s;e travellers &s;et out to morrow with|out damage or hurt."</P>
<P>"'Tis plaguy unlucky that my comrades who drove the coach &s;hould be tho&s;e unac|quainted with our confederacy! But never fear, friend Bapti&s;te: an hour will bring me to the cavern; it is now but ten o'clock, and by twelve you may expect the arrival of the band. By the bye, take care of your wife: you know how &s;trong is her repug|nance to our mode of life, and &s;he may find means to give information to the lady's &s;er|vants of our de&s;ign."</P>
<P>"Oh! I am &s;ecure of her &s;ilence; &s;he is too much afraid of me, and fond of her children, to dare to betray my &s;ecret. Be|&s;ides, Jacques and Robert keep a &s;trict eye over her, and &s;he is not permitted to &s;et a

foot out of the cottage. The &s;ervants are &s;afely lodged in the barn. I &s;hall endeavour to keep all quiet till the arrival of our friends. Were I a&s;&s;ured of your finding them, the &s;trangers &s;hould be di&s;patched this in&s;tant; but as it is po&s;&s;ible for you to mi&s;s the banditti, I am fearful of being &s;um|moned by their dome&s;tics to produce them in the morning."</P>
<P>"And &s;uppo&s;e either of the travellers &s;hould di&s;cover your de&s;ign?"</P>
<P>"Then we mu&s;t poniard tho&s;e in our power, and take our chance about ma&s;ter|ing the re&s;t. However, to avoid running &s;uch a ri&s;k, ha&s;ten to the cavern; the ban|ditti never leave it before eleven, and if you u&s;e diligence you may reach it in time to &s;top them."</P>
<P>"Tell Robert that I have taken his hor&s;e; my own has broken his bridle, and e&s;caped into the wood. What is the watch-word?"</P>
<P>"The reward of courage."</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;ufficient. I ha&s;ten to the cavern."</P>
<P>"And I to rejoin my gue&s;ts, le&s;t my ab|&s;ence
<PB N="199" REF="205">
&s;hould create &s;u&s;picion. Farewell, and be diligent."</P>
<P>The&s;e worthy a&s;&s;ociates now &s;eparated; the one bent his cour&s;e towards the &s;table, while the other returned to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>You may judge what mu&s;t have been my feelings during this conver&s;ation, of which I lo&s;t not a &s;ingle &s;yllable. I dared not tru&s;t my&s;elf to my reflections, nor did any means pre&s;ent it&s;elf to e&s;cape the dangers which threatened me. Re&s;i&s;tance I knew to be vain; I was unarmed, and a &s;ingle man again&s;t three. However, I re&s;olved at lea&s;t to &s;ell my life as dearly as I could. Dread|ing le&s;t Bapti&s;te &s;hould perceive my ab&s;ence, and &s;u&s;pect me to have overheard the me&s;|&s;age with which Claude was di&s;patched, I ha&s;tily re-lighted my candle and quitted the chamber. On de&s;cending, I found the table &s;pread for &s;ix per&s;ons. The barone&s;s &s;at by the fire-&s;ide; Marguerite was employed in dre&s;&s;ing a &s;allad, and her &s;tep-&s;ons were whi&s;|pering together at the further end of the room. Bapti&s;te, having the round of the gar|den
<PB N="200" REF="206">
to make ere he could reach the cottage door, was not yet arrived. I &s;eated my&s;elf quietly oppo&s;ite to the barone&s;s.</P>
<P>A glance upon Marguerite told her that her hint had not been thrown away upon me. How different did &s;he now appear to me! What before &s;eemed gloom and &s;ul|lenne&s;s, I now found to be di&s;gu&s;t at her a&s;|&s;ociates and compa&s;&s;ion for my danger. I looked up to her as to my only re&s;ource; yet knowing her to be watched by her hu&s;|band with a &s;u&s;picious eye, I could place but little reliance on the exertions of her good will.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all my endeavours to conceal it, my agitation was but too vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed upon my countenance. I was pale, and both my words and actions were di&s;ordered and embarra&s;&s;ed. The young men ob&s;erved this, and enquired the cau&s;e. I attributed it to exce&s;s of fatigue, and the violent effect produced on me by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on. Whether they believed me or not, I will not pretend to &s;ay; they at lea&s;t cea&s;ed to em|barra&s;s
<PB N="201" REF="207">
me with their que&s;tions. I &s;trove to divert my attention from the perils which &s;urrounded me, by conver&s;ing on different &s;ubjects with the barone&s;s. I talked of Ger|many, declaring my intention of vi&s;iting it immediately: God knows, that I little thought at that moment of ever &s;eeing it! She replied to me with great ea&s;e and polite|ne&s;s, profe&s;&s;ed that the plea&s;ure of making my acquaintance amply compen&s;ated for the delay in her journey, and gave me a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to make &s;ome &s;tay at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. As &s;he &s;poke thus, the youths exchanged a malicious &s;mile, which declared that &s;he would be fortunate if &s;he ever reached that ca&s;tle her&s;elf. This action did not e&s;cape me; but I concealed the emotion which it excited in my brea&s;t. I continued to conver&s;e with the lady; but my di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o frequently incoherent that&punc; as &s;he has &s;ince informed me, &s;he began to doubt whether I was in my right &s;en&s;es. The fact was, that while my conver&s;ation turned upon one &s;ubject, my thoughts were entirely oc|cupied
<PB N="202" REF="208">
by another. I meditated upon the means of quitting the cottage, finding my way to the barn, and giving the dome&s;tics information of our ho&s;t's de&s;igns. I was &s;oon convinced how impracticable was the attempt. Jacques and Robert watched my every movement with an attentive eye, and I was obliged to abandon the idea. All my hopes now re&s;ted upon Claude's not finding the banditti. In that ca&s;e, according to what I had overheard, we &s;hould be per|mitted to depart unhurt.</P>
<P>I &s;huddered involuntarily as Bapti&s;te en|tered the room. He made many apologies for his long ab&s;ence, but "he had been detained by affairs impo&s;&s;ible to be de|layed." He then entreated permi&s;&s;ion for his family to &s;up at the &s;ame table with us, without which, re&s;pect would not autho|rize his taking &s;uch a liberty. Oh! how in my heart I cur&s;ed the hypocrite! how I loathed his pre&s;ence, who was on the point of depriving me of an exi&s;tence, at that time infinitely dear! I had every rea|&s;on
<PB N="203" REF="209">
to be &s;atisfied with life; I had youth, wealth, rank, and education, and the faire&s;t pro&s;pects pre&s;ented them&s;elves before me. I &s;aw tho&s;e pro&s;pects on the point of clo&s;ing in the mo&s;t horrible manner: yet was I obliged to di&s;&s;imulate, and to receive with a &s;emblance of gratitude the fal&s;e civilities of him who held the dagger to my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The permi&s;&s;ion which our ho&s;t demanded was ea&s;ily obtained. We &s;eated our&s;elves at the table. The barone&s;s and my&s;elf oc|cupied one &s;ide; the &s;ons were oppo&s;ite to us, with their backs to the door. Bapti&s;te took his &s;eat by the barone&s;s, at the upper end; and the place next to him was left for his wife. She &s;oon entered the room, and placed before us a plain but comforta|ble pea&s;ant's repa&s;t. Our ho&s;t thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for the poorne&s;s of the &s;upper: "he had not been apprized of our coming; he could only offer us &s;uch fare as had been intended for his own fa|mily."</P>
<P>"But," added he, "&s;hould any accident
<PB N="204" REF="210">
detain my noble gue&s;ts longer than they at pre&s;ent intend, I hope to give them a bet|ter treatment."</P>
<P>The villain! I well knew the accident to which he alluded. I &s;huddered at the treatment which he taught us to expect.</P>
<P>My companion in danger &s;eemed entirely to have got rid of her chagrin at being de|layed. She laughed, and conver&s;ed with the family with infinite gaiety. I &s;trove, but in vain, to follow her example. My &s;pirits were evidently forced, and the con|&s;traint which I put upon my&s;elf e&s;caped not Bapti&s;te's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"Come, come, mon&s;ieur, cheer up!" &s;aid he; "you &s;eem not quite recovered from your fatigue. To rai&s;e your &s;pirits, what &s;ay you to a gla&s;s of excellent old wine which was left me by my father? God re&s;t his &s;oul, he is in a better world! I &s;el|dom produce this wine; but as I am not honoured with &s;uch gue&s;ts every day, this is an occa&s;ion which de&s;erves a bottle."</P>
<P>He then gave his wife a key, and in|&s;tructed
<PB N="205" REF="211">
her where to find the wine of which he &s;poke. She &s;eemed by no means plea&s;ed with the commi&s;&s;ion; &s;he took the key with an embarra&s;&s;ed air, and he&s;itated to quit the table.</P>
<P>"Did you hear me?" &s;aid Bapti&s;te in an angry tone.</P>
<P>Marguerite darted upon him a look of mingled anger and fear, and left the cham|ber. His eyes followed her &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly till &s;he had clo&s;ed the door.</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned with a bottle &s;ealed with yellow wax. She placed it upon the table, and gave the key back to her hu&s;band. I &s;u&s;pected that this liquor was not pre|&s;ented to us without de&s;ign, and I watched Marguerite's movements with inquietude. She was employed in rin&s;ing &s;ome &s;mall horn goblets. As &s;he placed them before Bapti&s;te, &s;he &s;aw that my eye was fixed upon her; and at the moment when &s;he thought her&s;elf unob&s;erved by the banditti, &s;he mo|tioned to me with her head not to ta&s;te the liquor. She then re&s;umed her place.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="212">In the mean while our ho&s;t had drawn the cork, and, filling two of the goblets, of|fered them to the lady and my&s;elf. She at fir&s;t made &s;ome objections, but the in&s;tances of Bapti&s;te were &s;o urgent, that &s;he was obliged to comply. Fearing to excite &s;u&s;|picion, I he&s;itated not to take the goblet pre&s;ented to me. By its &s;mell and colour, I gue&s;&s;ed it to be champagne; but &s;ome grains of powder floating upon the top con|vinced me that it was not unadulterated. However, I dared not to expre&s;s my re|pugnance to drinking it; I lifted it to my lips, and &s;eemed to be &s;wallowing it: &s;ud|denly &s;tarting from my chair, I made the be&s;t of my way towards a va&s;e of water at &s;ome di&s;tance, in which Marguerite had been rin&s;ing the goblets. I pretended to &s;pit out the wine with di&s;gu&s;t, and took an opportunity, unperceived, of emptying the liquor into the va&s;e.</P>
<P>The banditti &s;eemed alarmed at my action. Jacques half ro&s;e from his chair, put his hand into his bo&s;om, and I di&s;co|vered
<PB N="207" REF="213">
the haft of a dagger. I returned to my &s;eat with tranquillity, and affected not to have ob&s;erved their confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"You have not &s;uited my ta&s;te, hone&s;t friend," &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Bap|ti&s;te: "I never can drink champagne without its producing a violent illne&s;s. I &s;wallowed a few mouthfuls ere I was aware of its quality, and fear that I &s;hall &s;uffer for my imprudence."</P>
<P>Bapti&s;te and Jacques exchanged looks of di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>"Perhaps," &s;aid Robert, "the &s;mell may be di&s;agreeable to you?"</P>
<P>He quitted his chair, and removed the goblet. I ob&s;erved, that he examined whe|ther it was nearly empty.</P>
<P>"He mu&s;t have drank &s;ufficient," &s;aid he to his brother in a low voice, while he re-&s;eated him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Marguerite looked apprehen&s;ive that I had ta&s;ted the liquor. A glance from my eye re-a&s;&s;ured her.</P>
<P>I waited with anxiety for the effects
<PB N="208" REF="214">
which the beverage would produce upon the lady. I doubted not but the grains which I had ob&s;erved were poi&s;onous, and lamented that it had been impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to warn her of the danger. But a few minutes had elap&s;ed, before I per|ceived her eyes grow heavy; her head &s;ank upon her &s;houlder, and &s;he fell into a deep &s;leep. I affected not to attend to this cir|cum&s;tance, and continued my conver&s;ation with Bapti&s;te, with all the outward gaiety in my power to a&s;&s;ume. But he no longer an&s;wered me without con&s;traint. He eyed me with di&s;tru&s;t and a&s;toni&s;hment, and I &s;aw that the banditti were frequently whi&s;|pering among them&s;elves. My &s;ituation became every moment more painful: I &s;u&s;|tained the character of confidence with a wor&s;e grace than ever. Equally afraid of the arrival of their accomplices, and of their &s;u&s;pecting my knowledge of their de&s;igns, I knew not how to di&s;&s;ipate the di&s;tru&s;t which the banditti evidently enter|tained for me. In this new dilemma the
<PB N="209" REF="215">
friendly Marguerite again a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. She pa&s;&s;ed behind the chairs of her &s;tep-&s;ons, &s;topped for a moment oppo&s;ite to me, clo&s;ed her eyes, and reclined her head upon her &s;houlder. This hint immediately di&s;pelled my incertitude. It told me, that I ought to imitate the barone&s;s, and pretend that the liquor had taken its full effect upon me. I did &s;o, and in a few minutes &s;eemed per|fectly overcome with &s;lumber.</P>
<P>"So!" cried Bapti&s;te, as I fell back in my chair, "at la&s;t he &s;leeps! I began to think that he had &s;cented our de&s;ign, and that we &s;hould have been forced to di&s;patch him at all events."</P>
<P>"And why not di&s;patch him at all events?" enquired the ferocious Jacques: "why leave him the po&s;&s;ibility of betray|ing our &s;ecret? Marguerite, give me one of my pi&s;tols: a &s;ingle touch of the trigger will fini&s;h him at once."</P>
<P>"And &s;uppo&s;ing," rejoined the father, "&s;uppo&s;ing that our friends &s;hould not ar|rive to night, a pretty figure we &s;hould make
<PB N="210" REF="216">
when the &s;ervants enquire for him in the morning! No, no, Jacques; we mu&s;t wait for our a&s;&s;ociates. If they join us, we are &s;trong enough to di&s;patch the dome&s;tics as well as their ma&s;ters, and the booty is our own. If Claude does not find the troop, we mu&s;t take patience, and &s;uffer the prey to &s;lip through our fingers. Ah! boys, boys, had you arrived but five minutes &s;ooner, the Spaniard would have been done for, and two thou&s;and pi&s;toles our own. But you are always out of the way when you are mo&s;t wanted. You are the mo&s;t unlucky rogues&mdash;&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, well, father!" an&s;wered Jacques; "had you been of my mind, all would have been over by this time. You, Robert, Claude, and my&s;elf&mdash;why the &s;trangers were but double the number, and I warrant you we might have ma&s;tered them. How|ever, Claude is gone; 'tis too late to think of it now. We mu&s;t wait patiently for the arrival of the gang; and if the travellers
<PB N="211" REF="217">
e&s;cape us to-night, we mu&s;t take care to way-lay them to-morrow."</P>
<P>"True! true!" &s;aid Bapti&s;te; "Mar|guerite, have you given the &s;leeping-draught to the waiting-women?"</P>
<P>She replied in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"All then is &s;afe. Come, come, boys; whatever falls out, we have no rea&s;on to complain of this adventure. We run no danger, may gain much, and can lo&s;e no|thing."</P>
<P>At this moment I heard a trampling of hor&s;es. Oh! how dreadful was the &s;ound to my ears! A cold &s;weat flowed down my forehead, and I felt all the terrors of impending death. I was by no means re|a&s;&s;ured by hearing the compa&s;&s;ionate Mar|guerite exclaim, in the accents of de&s;pair,</P>
<P>"Almighty God! they are lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Luckily the woodman and his &s;ons were too much occupied by the arrival of their a&s;&s;ociates to attend to me, or the violence of my agitation would have convinced them that my &s;leep was feigned.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="218">"Open! open!" exclaimed &s;everal voices on the out&s;ide of the cottage.</P>
<P>"Yes! yes!" cried Bapti&s;te joyfully; "they are our friends, &s;ure enough. Now then our booty is certain. Away! lads, away! Lead them to the barn; you know what is to be done there."</P>
<P>Robert ha&s;tened to open the door of the cottage.</P>
<P>"But fir&s;t," &s;aid Jacques, taking up his arms, "fir&s;t let me di&s;patch the&s;e &s;leep|ers."</P>
<P>"No, no, no!" replied his father: "Go you to the barn, where your pre&s;ence is wanted. Leave me to take care of the&s;e and the women above."</P>
<P>Jacques obeyed, and followed his bro|ther. They &s;eemed to conver&s;e with the new-comers for a few minutes; after which I heard the robbers di&s;mount, and, as I conjectured, bend their cour&s;e towards the barn.</P>
<P>"So! that is wi&s;ely done!" muttered Bapti&s;te; "they have quitted their hor&s;es,
<PB N="213" REF="219">
that they may fall upon the &s;trangers by &s;urpri&s;e. Good! good! and now to bu|&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>I heard him approach a &s;mall cupboard which was fixed up in a di&s;tant part of the room, and unlock it. At this moment I felt my&s;elf &s;haken gently.</P>
<P>"Now! now!" whi&s;pered Marguerite.</P>
<P>I opened my eyes. Bapti&s;te &s;tood with his back towards me. No one el&s;e was in the room &s;ave Marguerite and the &s;leeping lady. The villain had taken a dagger from the cupboard, and &s;eemed examining whe|ther it was &s;ufficiently &s;harp. I had ne|glected to furni&s;h my&s;elf with arms; but I perceived this to be my only chance of e&s;caping, and re&s;olved not to lo&s;e the op|portunity. I &s;prang from my &s;eat, darted &s;uddenly upon Bapti&s;te, and, cla&s;ping my hands round his throat, pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o forci|bly as to prevent his uttering a &s;ingle cry. You may remember, that I was remarkable at Salamanca for the power of my arm. It now rendered me an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. Sur|pri&s;ed,
<PB N="214" REF="220">
terrified, and breathle&s;s, the villain was by no means an equal antagoni&s;t. I threw him upon the ground; I gra&s;ped him &s;till tighter; and while I fixed him without motion upon the floor, Marguerite, wre&s;ting the dagger from his hand, plunged it repeatedly in his heart till he expired.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this horrible but nece&s;|&s;ary act perpetrated, than Marguerite called on me to follow her.</P>
<P>"Flight is our only refuge," &s;aid &s;he, "quick! quick! away!"</P>
<P>I he&s;itated not to obey her; but unwilling to leave the barone&s;s a victim to the ven|geance of the robbers, I rai&s;ed her in my arms &s;till &s;leeping, and ha&s;tened after Mar|guerite. The hor&s;es of the banditti were fa&s;tened near the door. My conductre&s;s &s;prang upon one of them. I followed her example, placed the barone&s;s before me, and &s;purred on my hor&s;e. Our only hope was to reach Stra&s;bourg, which was much nearer than the perfidious Claude had a&s;|&s;ured me. Marguerite was well acquainted
<PB N="215" REF="221">
with the road, and galloped on before me. We were obliged to pa&s;s by the barn, where the robbers were &s;laughtering our dome&s;tics. The door was open: we di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the &s;hrieks of the dying, and impre|cations of the murderers. What I felt at that moment language is unable to de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Jacques heard the trampling of our hor&s;es, as we ru&s;hed by the barn. He flew to the door with a burning torch in his hand, and ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed the fugitives.</P>
<P>"Betrayed! betrayed!" he &s;houted to his companions.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly they left their bloody work, and ha&s;tened to regain their hor&s;es. We heard no more. I buried my &s;purs in the &s;ides of my cour&s;er, and Marguerite goaded on hers with the poniard which had al|ready rendered us &s;uch good &s;ervice. We flew light lightning, and gained the open plains. Already was Stra&s;bourg's &s;teeple in &s;ight, when we heard the robbers pur&s;u|ing us. Marguerite looked back, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed
<PB N="216" REF="222">
our followers de&s;cending a &s;mall hill at no great di&s;tance. It was in vain that we urged on our hor&s;es: the noi&s;e ap|proached nearer with every moment.</P>
<P>"We are lo&s;t!" &s;he exclaimed; "the villains gain upon us!"</P>
<P>"On! on!" replied I; "I hear the trampling of hor&s;es coming from the town."</P>
<P>We redoubled our exertions, and were &s;oon aware of a numerous band of cava|liers, who came towards us at full &s;peed. They were on the point of pa&s;&s;ing us.</P>
<P>"Stay! &s;tay!" &s;hrieked Marguerite; "&s;ave us! for God's &s;ake, &s;ave us!"</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t, who &s;eemed to act as guide, immediately reined in his &s;teed.</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;he! 'tis &s;he!" exclaimed he, &s;pringing upon the ground: "Stop, my lord, &s;top! they are &s;afe! 'tis my mother!"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment Marguerite threw her&s;elf from her hor&s;e, cla&s;ped him in her arms, and covered him with ki&s;&s;es. The other cavaliers &s;topped at the exclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">"The barone&s;s Lindenberg!" cried ano|ther of the &s;trangers eagerly: "Where is &s;he? Is &s;he not with you?"</P>
<P>He &s;topped on beholding her lying &s;en&s;e|le&s;s in my arms. Ha&s;tily he caught her from me. The profound &s;leep in which &s;he was plunged, made him at fir&s;t tremble for her life; but the beating of her heart &s;oon re-a&s;&s;ured him.</P>
<P>"God be thanked!" &s;aid he, "&s;he has e&s;caped unhurt."</P>
<P>I interrupted his joy by pointing out the brigands, who continued to approach. No &s;ooner had I mentioned them, than the greate&s;t part of the company, which ap|peared to be chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers, ha&s;tened forward to meet them. The vil|lains &s;taid not to receive their attack. Per|ceiving their danger, they turned the heads of their hor&s;es, and fled into the wood, whither they were followed by our pre&s;erv|ers. In the mean while the &s;tranger, whom I gue&s;&s;ed to be the baron Lindenberg, after thanking me for my care of his lady, pro|po&s;ed our returning with all &s;peed to the
<PB N="218" REF="224">
town. The barone&s;s, on whom the effects of the opiate had not cea&s;ed to operate, was placed before him; Marguerite and her &s;on remounted their hor&s;es; the baron's dome&s;tics followed, and we &s;oon arrived at the inn, where he had taken his apart|ments.</P>
<P>This was at the Au&s;trian Eagle, where my banker, whom before my quitting Paris I had appri&s;ed of my intention to vi&s;it Stra&s;|bourg, had prepared lodgings for me. I rejoiced at this circum&s;tance. It gave me an opportunity of cultivating the baron's acquaintance, which I fore&s;aw would be of u&s;e to me in Germany. Immediately upon our arrival, the lady was conveyed to bed. A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, who pre|&s;cribed a medicine likely to counteract the effects of the &s;leepy potion; and after it had been poured down her throat, &s;he was com|mitted to the care of the ho&s;te&s;s. The baron then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and entreated me to recount the particulars of this adven|ture. I complied with his reque&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly; for, in pain re&s;pecting Stephano's
<PB N="219" REF="225">
fate, whom I had been compelled to aban|don to the cruelty of the banditti, I found it impo&s;&s;ible for me to repo&s;e till I had &s;ome news of him. I received but too &s;oon the intelligence that my tru&s;ty &s;ervant had peri&s;hed. The &s;oldiers who had pur&s;ued the brigands, returned while I was employed in relating my adventure to the baron. By their account, I found that the robbers had been overtaken. Guilt and true courage are incompatible: they had thrown them&s;elves at the feet of their pur&s;uers, had &s;urrendered them&s;elves without &s;triking a blow, had di&s;|covered their &s;ecret retreat, made known their &s;ignals by which the re&s;t of the gang might be &s;eized, and, in &s;hort, had betrayed every mark of cowardice and ba&s;ene&s;s. By this means the whole of the band, con&s;i&s;ting of near &s;ixty per&s;ons, had been made pri|&s;oners, bound, and conducted to Stra&s;bourg.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;oldiers ha&s;tened to the cottage, one of the banditti &s;erving them as guide. Their fir&s;t vi&s;it was to the fatal barn, where they were fortunate enough to find two of the baron's &s;ervants &s;till alive, though de&s;|perately
<PB N="220" REF="226">
wounded. The re&s;t had expired beneath the &s;words of the robbers, and of the&s;e my unhappy Stephano was one.</P>
<P>Alarmed at our e&s;cape, the robbers, in their ha&s;te to overtake us, had neglected to vi&s;it the cottage; in con&s;equence, the &s;ol|diers found the two waiting-women unhurt, and buried in the &s;ame death-like &s;lumber which had overpowered their mi&s;tre&s;s. There was nobody el&s;e found in the cottage, ex|cept a child not above four years old, which the &s;oldiers brought away with them. We were bu&s;ying our&s;elves with conjectures re|&s;pecting the birth of this little unfortunate, when Marguerite ru&s;hed into the room with the baby in her arms. She fell at the feet of the officer who was making us this report, and ble&s;&s;ed him a thou&s;and times for the pre&s;ervation of her child.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t bur&s;t of maternal tender|ne&s;s was over, I be&s;ought her to declare by what means &s;he had been united to a man who&s;e principles &s;eemed &s;o totally di&s;cordant with her own. She bent her eyes down|wards, and wiped a few tears from her cheek.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="227">"Gentlemen," &s;aid &s;he, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes, "I would reque&s;t a favour of you. You have a right to know on whom you confer an obligation; I will not, therefore, &s;tifle a confe&s;&s;ion which covers me with &s;hame; but permit me to compri&s;e it in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"I was born in Stra&s;bourg, of re&s;pectable parents; their names I mu&s;t at pre&s;ent con|ceal. My father &s;till lives, and de&s;erves not to be involved in my infamy. If you grant my reque&s;t, you &s;hall be informed of my family name. A villain made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of my affections, and to follow him I quitted my father's hou&s;e. Yet, though my pa&s;&s;ions overpowered my virtue, I &s;unk not into that degeneracy of vice but too com|monly the lot of women who make the fir&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep. I loved my &s;educer, dearly loved him! I was true to his bed: this baby, and the youth who warned you, my lord baron, of your lady's danger, are the pledges of our affection. Even at this moment I lament his lo&s;s, though 'tis to him that I owe all the mi&s;eries of my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="228">"He was of noble birth, but he had &s;quandered away his paternal inheri|tance. His relations con&s;idered him as a di&s;grace to their name, and utterly di&s;|carded him. His exce&s;&s;es drew upon him the indignation of the police. He was obliged to fly from Stra&s;bourg; and &s;aw no other re&s;ource from beggary than an union with the banditti who infe&s;ted the neigh|bouring fore&s;t, and who&s;e troop was chiefly compo&s;ed of young men of family in the &s;ame predicament with him&s;elf. I was de|termined not to for&s;ake him. I followed him to the cavern of the brigands, and &s;hared with him the mi&s;ery in&s;eparable from a life of pillage. But though I was aware that our exi&s;tence was &s;upported by plunder, I knew not all the horrible circum&s;tances attached to my lover's profe&s;&s;ion: the&s;e he concealed from me with the utmo&s;t care. He was con&s;cious that my &s;entiments were not &s;ufficiently depraved to look without horror upon a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He &s;uppo&s;ed, and with ju&s;tice, that I &s;hould fly with dete&s;ta|tion from the embraces of a murderer. Eight
<PB N="223" REF="229">
years of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had not abated his love for me; and he cautiou&s;ly removed from my knowledge every circum&s;tance which might lead me to &s;u&s;pect the crimes in which he but too often participated. He &s;ucceeded perfectly. It was not till after my &s;educer's death that I di&s;covered his hands to have been &s;tained with the blood of innocence.</P>
<P>"One fatal night he was brought back to the cavern, covered with wounds: he re|ceived them in attacking an Engli&s;h tra|veller, whom his companions immediately &s;acrificed to their re&s;entment. He had only time to entreat my pardon for all the &s;orrows which he had cau&s;ed me: he pre&s;&s;ed my hand to his lips, and expired. My grief was inexpre&s;&s;ible. As &s;oon as its violence abated, I re&s;olved to return to Stra&s;bourg, to throw my&s;elf, with my two children; at my father's feet, and implore his forgivene&s;s, though I little hoped to obtain it. What was my con&s;ternation when in|formed, that no one entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of their retreat was ever permitted to
<PB N="224" REF="230">
quit the troop of the banditti; that I mu&s;t give up all hopes of ever rejoining &s;ociety, and con&s;ent in&s;tantly to accept one of their band for my hu&s;band! My prayers and remon&s;trances were vain. They ca&s;t lots to decide to who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I &s;hould fall. I became the property of the infamous Bapti&s;te. A robber, who had once been a monk, pronounced over us a burle&s;que ra|ther than a religious ceremony: I and my children were delivered into the hands of my new hu&s;band, and he conveyed us im|mediately to his home.</P>
<P>"He a&s;&s;ured me that he had long enter|tained for me the mo&s;t ardent regard; but that friend&s;hip for my decea&s;ed lover had obliged him to &s;tifle his de&s;ires. He en|deavoured to reconcile me to my fate, and for &s;ome time treated me with re&s;pect and gentlene&s;s. At length, finding that my aver|&s;ion rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, he obtained tho&s;e favours by violence which I per&s;i&s;ted to refu&s;e him. No re&s;ource re|mained for me but to bear my &s;orrows with patience; I was con&s;cious that I de&s;erved
<PB N="225" REF="231">
them but too well. Flight was forbidden. My children were in the power of Bapti&s;te; and he had &s;worn, that if I attempted to e&s;|cape, their lives &s;hould pay for it. I had had too many opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing the barbarity of his nature, to doubt his fulfilling his oath to the very letter. Sad experience had convinced me of the horrors of my &s;ituation. My fir&s;t lover had carefully con|cealed them from me; Bapti&s;te rather re|joiced in opening my eyes to the cruelties of his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;trove to familiari&s;e me with blood and &s;laughter.</P>
<P>"My nature was licentious and warm, but not cruel: my conduct had been im|prudent, but my heart was not unprincipled. Judge, then, what I mu&s;t have felt at being a continual witne&s;s of crimes the mo&s;t hor|rible and revolting! Judge how I mu&s;t have grieved at being united to a man, who re|ceived the un&s;u&s;peding gue&s;t with an air of openne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, at the very moment that he meditated his de&s;truction! Chagrin and di&s;content preyed upon my con&s;titu|tion; the few charms be&s;towed on me by nature withered away, and the dejection of
<PB N="226" REF="232">
my countenance denoted the &s;ufferings of my heart. I was tempted a thou&s;and times to put an end to my exi&s;tence; but the re|membrance of my children held my hand. I trembled to leave my dear boys in my tyrant's power, and trembled yet more for their virtue than their lives. The &s;econd was &s;till too young to benefit by my in&s;truc|tions; but in the heart of my elde&s;t I la|boured uncea&s;ingly to plant tho&s;e principles which might enable him to avoid the crimes of his parents. He li&s;tened to me with docility, or rather with eagerne&s;s. Even at his early age, he &s;hewed that he was not calculated for the &s;ociety of villains; and the only comfort which I enjoyed among my &s;orrows, was to witne&s;s the dawning virtues of my Theodore.</P>
<P>"Such was my &s;ituation when the per|fidy of Don Alphon&s;o's po&s;tillion conduct|ed him to the cottage. His youth, air, and manners intere&s;ted me mo&s;t forcibly in his behalf. The ab&s;ence of my hu&s;|band's &s;ons gave me an opportunity which I had long wi&s;hed to find, and I re&s;olved to ri&s;que every thing to pre&s;erve the &s;tranger.
<PB N="227" REF="233">
The vigilance of Bapti&s;te prevented me from warning Don Alphon&s;o of his dan|ger, I knew that my betraying the &s;ecret would be immediately puni&s;hed with death; and however embittered was my life by ca|lamities, I wanted courage to &s;acrifice it for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving that of another per&s;on. My only hope re&s;ted upon pro|curing &s;uccour from Stra&s;bourg. At this I re&s;olved to try; and &s;hould an opportu|nity offer of warning Don Alphon&s;o of his danger unob&s;erved, I was determined to &s;eize it with avidity. By Bapti&s;te's orders I went up &s;tairs to make the &s;tranger's bed: I &s;pread upon it &s;heets in which a traveller had been murdered but a few nights before, and which &s;till were &s;tained with blood. I hoped that the&s;e marks would not e&s;cape the vigilance of our gue&s;t, and that he would collect, from them the de&s;igns of my perfidious hu&s;band. Neither was this the only &s;tep which I took to pre&s;erve the &s;tranger. Theodore was confined to his bed by illne&s;s. I &s;tole into his room unob|&s;erved by my tyrant, communicated to him my project, and he entered into it with ea|gerne&s;s.
<PB N="228" REF="234">
He ro&s;e in &s;pite of his malady, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with all &s;peed. I fa&s;tened one of the &s;heets round his arms, and low|ered him from the window. He flew to the &s;table, took Claude's hor&s;e, and ha&s;|tened to Stra&s;bourg. Had he been ac|co&s;ted by the banditti, he was to have de|clared him&s;elf &s;ent upon a me&s;&s;age by Bap|ti&s;te, but fortunately he reached the town without meeting any ob&s;tacle. Immedi|ately upon his arrival at Stra&s;bourg, he en|treated a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the magi&s;trate: his &s;tory pa&s;&s;ed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the &s;afety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it &s;truck him that &s;he might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the &s;oldiers towards the cottage, and arrived ju&s;t in time to &s;ave us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies."</P>
<P>Here I interrupted Marguerite to en|quire why the &s;leepy potion had been pre|&s;ented to me. She &s;aid, that Bapti&s;te &s;up|po&s;ed me to have arms about me, and
<PB N="229" REF="235">
wi&s;hed to incapacitate me from making re&s;i&s;tance: it was a precaution which he always took, &s;ince, as the travellers had no hopes of e&s;caping, de&s;pair would have in|cited them to &s;ell their lives dearly.</P>
<P>The baron then de&s;ired Marguerite to in|form him what were her pre&s;ent plans. I join|ed him in declaring my readine&s;s to &s;hew my gratitude to her for the pre&s;ervation of my life.</P>
<P>"Di&s;gu&s;ted with a world," &s;he replied, "in which I have met with nothing but misfortunes, my only wi&s;h is to retire into a convent. But fir&s;t I mu&s;t provide for my children. I find that my mother is no more&mdash;probably driven to an untimely grave by my de&s;ertion. My father is &s;till living. He is not an hard man. Perhaps, gentle|men, in &s;pite of my ingratitude and impru|dence, your interce&s;&s;ions may induce him to forgive me, and to take charge of his unfortunate grand&s;ons. If you obtain this boon for me, you will repay my &s;ervices a thou&s;and-fold."</P>
<P>Both the baron and my&s;elf a&s;&s;ured Mar|guerite, that we would &s;pare no pains to
<PB N="230" REF="236">
obtain her pardon: and that, even &s;hould her father be inflexible, &s;he need be under no apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting the fate of her children. I engaged my&s;elf to provide for Theodore, and the baron promi&s;ed to take the younge&s;t under his protection. The grateful mother thanked us with tears for what &s;he called genero&s;ity, but which in fact was no more than a proper &s;en&s;e of our ob|ligations to her. She then left the room to put her little boy to bed, whom fatigue and &s;leep had completely overpowered</P>
<P>The barone&s;s, on recovering, and being informed from what dangers I had re&s;cued her, &s;et no bounds to the expre&s;&s;ions of her gratitude. She was joined &s;o warmly by her hu&s;band in pre&s;&s;ing me to accom|pany them to their ca&s;tle in Bavaria, that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t their entrea|ties. During a week which we pa&s;&s;ed at Stra&s;bourg, the intere&s;ts of Marguerite were not forgotten. In our application to her father we &s;ucceeded as amply as we could wi&s;h. The good old man had lo&s;t his wife. He had no children but this un|fortunate daughter, of whom he had re|ceived
<PB N="231" REF="237">
no news for almo&s;t fourteen years. He was &s;urrounded by di&s;tant relations, who waited with impatience for his decea&s;e, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his money. When therefore Marguerite appeared again &s;o unexpectedly, he con&s;idered her as a gift from Heaven. He received her and her children with open arms, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in his hou&s;e without delay. The di&s;appointed cou&s;ins were obliged to give place. The old man would not hear of his daughter's retiring into a convent. He &s;aid, that &s;he was too nece&s;|&s;ary to his happine&s;s, and &s;he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h her de&s;igns. But no per&s;ua&s;ions could induce Theodore to give up the plan which I had at fir&s;t marked out for him. He had attached him&s;elf to me mo&s;t &s;incerely during my &s;tay at Stra&s;bourg; and when I was on the point of leaving it, he be&s;ought me with tears to take him into my &s;ervice. He &s;et forth all his little talents in the mo&s;t favourable colours, and tried to convince me that I &s;hould find him of infinite u&s;e to me upon the road. I was unwilling to charge my|&s;elf
<PB N="232" REF="238">
with a lad &s;carcely turned of thirteen, who I knew could only be a burthen to me: however, I could not re&s;i&s;t the entrea|ties of this affectionate youth, who in fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and e&s;timable qualities. With &s;ome difficulty he per&s;uaded his re|lations to let him follow me; and that per|mi&s;&s;ion once obtained, he was dubbed with the title of my page. Having pa&s;&s;ed a week at Stra&s;bourg, Theodore and my&s;elf &s;et out for Bavaria, in company with the baron and his lady. The&s;e latter, as well as my|&s;elf, had forced Marguerite to accept &s;e|veral pre&s;ents of value, both for her&s;elf and her younge&s;t &s;on. On leaving her, I pro|mi&s;ed his mother faithfully, that I would re&s;tore Theodore to her within the year.</P>
<P>I have related this adventure at length, Lorenzo, that you might under&s;tand the means by which "the adventurer Al|phon&s;o d'Alvarada got introduced into the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg." Judge from this &s;pecimen, how much faith &s;hould be given to your aunt's a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
