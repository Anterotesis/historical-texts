</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEarly Beloved Country-Men and fellow Citizens, &s;uffer me to &s;top you a little in the furious Car|reer of your Pa&s;&s;ion, to hear a few Words of &s;o|ber and unprejudiced Rea&s;on; I hope they will not be the le&s;s gratefull, if I acco&s;t you in that manner of Rhetorick, which your Ears are mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to: I have cho&s;en an Apocryphal Text, becau&s;e my Subject is not Sacred, but Secular, but if it has not the Stamp of divine In&s;piration; it is taken from a Book, which of all that are not Canonical, contains the mo&s;t &s;ublime, mo&s;t u&s;eful, and mo&s;t approved Maxims of Wi&s;dom, whether private OEconomical or Political; and as all Wi&s;dom and Truth cometh from God, in that Sen&s;e my Text may be &s;aid to be of divine Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Dearly beloved Country-Men, a Generous, Power|ful and Victorious Nation, invites you to an intimate Union with them&s;elves, a Nation who&s;e Laws are more Ju&s;t, who&s;e Government is more Mild, who&s;e People are more Free, Ea&s;y and Happy, than any other in <HI>Europe;</HI> a Nation who by their Wealth, Wi&s;dom and Valour, have broke the mo&s;t formidable Power that ever threa|tned <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> To who&s;e victorious Arms even you your &s;elves owe your pre&s;ent Security; this Nation I &s;ay, invites you to a Co-partner-&s;hip of all the Advan|tages they pre&s;ently Enjoy, or may rea&s;onably hope for: A gracious Queen of the ancient Line of our own Mo|narchs, de&s;ires nothing more than that the People from whom &s;he derives her Blood, &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame Li|berty and Plenty with others whom Providence has cal|led her to Govern. It might ju&s;tly have been expected, that &s;uch a generous Propo&s;al would have been well|com'd with the univer&s;al Acclamations of all Ranks and Degrees of People, in&s;tead of that you have received it with Riots, Mobs and Tumults; if the offer had not been Profitable, it was at lea&s;t Civil, and de&s;erv'd a friendly Reception, and a courteous An&s;wer: A Treaty that was enter'd into at the de&s;ire of your own Parlia|ment, as well as that of your Neighbours, and carried on by the Authority of the common Soveraign of both, &s;uch a Treaty I &s;ay, was a matter of that weight as made it a very unfit Subject for the Judgment (much more for the Scorn and Contempt) of Boys, Apprenti|ces, and Trade&s;-men: But &s;ince the tran&s;cendent Wi&s;|dom of your Leaders have thought otherways, let me be&s;eech you in the words of my Author, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 11. &amp; 7. <HI>Blame not before thou ha&s;t examined the Truth, under|&s;tand</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>fir&s;t and then Rebuke:</HI> To enable you in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to make &s;uch an Enquiry, I have cho&s;en the words of my Text, <HI>Better is he that Laboureth and aboundeth in all Things, than he that boa&s;teth him&s;elf and wanteth Bread.</HI></P>
<P>From the words you may Ob&s;erve, a very intimate Conjunction betwixt three di&s;mal Companions, <HI>Pride, Poverty</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s;</HI> this is a wor&s;e Union a great deal than that which we are to Di&s;cour&s;e of at pre&s;ent, the&s;e three love extreamly to keep Company, and I could never gue&s;s for what rea&s;on, unle&s;s it be to Teaze and Vex one another: <HI>Poverty</HI> does what &s;he can to &s;tarve <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>Pride</HI> eats out the Heart, Blood, and Gutts of <HI>Poverty,</HI> and <HI>Lazine&s;s</HI> will not &s;tir an Inch to relieve either: That the&s;e three fatal Si&s;ters may not only be &s;eparated, but eternally Bani&s;h'd this Kingdom, it &s;hall be the Subject of my following Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;how, that it's better to Encrea&s;e our Trade, Manufacture, and Riches, by an Union with <HI>England,</HI> than to boa&s;t of our Soveraignty and Starve; <HI>For better is he that Labou|reth and aboundeth in all Things, than he that boa&s;teth him&s;elf and wanteth Bread.</HI></P>
<P>And here indeed it mu&s;t be Prov'd, that an Union with <HI>England</HI> will Encrea&s;e our Trade and Manufacture, in order to which, I will ask the greate&s;t Zealote again&s;t the Union, a few Que&s;tions, and let him an&s;wer me if he can. Whether the great difference betwixt the Wealth of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> is entirly Owing to the Natural Advantages of <HI>England,</HI> as of fruitfulne&s;s of Soil Situation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or, if it does not in &s;ome mea&s;ure proceed from political cau&s;es? <HI>Scotland</HI> is equal at lea&s;t in Extent to a Third of <HI>England,</HI> its People more health|ful, more Prolifick and more Temperate, why has
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>England</HI> then &s;even times the Number of People, every Acre in <HI>Scotland</HI> is not Barren, nor every Acre in <HI>Eng|land</HI> fruitful, how comes it then that <HI>England</HI> has Fifty times the Riches of <HI>Scotland?</HI> For Example; why does <HI>Oxford-</HI>Shire, not &s;o big as <HI>Fiffe,</HI> pay to a Land-Tax; near as much as all <HI>Scotland?</HI> Are there not many places on each &s;ide the Firth of <HI>Forth</HI> which exceed the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in Soil, Situation, Products Natur|al and Artificial; How comes it to pa&s;s then that the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> has more Trade, more Rich Mer|chants and pays more Cu&s;toms, than all the Towns in <HI>Scotland</HI> put together. It is plain, the&s;e great differ|ences do not proceed meerly from natural, but likewi&s;e from Political Cau&s;es, nay lt's ea&s;y to A&s;&s;igne a piece of <HI>England</HI> equal in extent, much Inferior to the Gifts of Na|ture of &s;ome part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet Triple in Value, I know <HI>Wales</HI> is brought by &s;ome as an In&s;tance to Prove that an Union will not encrea&s;e the Trade and Riches of a Mountanous Country, that their Condition is not bettered by an Union with <HI>England:</HI> To this I An&s;wer, that the matter of Fact is fal&s;e, if the Objecti|on has any Strength, it ought to Prove, that <HI>Wales</HI> would not be the wor&s;e to be deprived of the Benefite of the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> a Paradox too &s;ublime for any <HI>Welch-</HI>Man, but mo&s;t obvious to the Elevated under|&s;tandings of &s;ome of our worthy Patriots. 2dly, I &s;ay, the Compari&s;on is not fairly &s;tated betwixt the wor&s;t part of <HI>England</HI> and the be&s;t of <HI>Scotland, Wales</HI> in many places does not Exceed the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in any thing except the height of the Mountains; But &s;et|ting a&s;ide all the&s;e things, let us State the Compari&s;on; The Twelve very &s;mall Countys of <HI>Wales</HI> contain 917
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Pari&s;hes, 58 Market Towns, 316000 People, and Pay 43752 <HI>lib. &s;terl.</HI> to the Land Tax, which &s;hows they are almo&s;t Equal to half the Number of People in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and Pay near as much Taxes as the whole, And it's known, that <HI>Wales</HI> is more Under-Rated in their Taxes, and ea&s;ier in the Exci&s;e than <HI>Scotland,</HI> Thus you &s;ee it would be hard to find 12 of the Riche&s;t Coun|ties in <HI>Scotland</HI> to compare with an equal Number and le&s;s extent of the wor&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> which is, as I &s;aid, a Demon&s;tration that the Riches of <HI>England</HI> is the Effect of Policy as much as of Nature; And is it not as plain, that the Protection of the &s;ame Laws, the influence of the &s;ame Government, the partner&s;hip of the &s;ame Plan|tations, and of all other Priviledges, Foregin and Dom|e&s;tick, will much Better the Condition of <HI>Scotland,</HI> There is hardly any &s;ubject of Trade of the Growth of <HI>England,</HI> which we are totally deprived of, and we have one Peculiar, which kind Providence and Nature has af|forded us, tho we never had the Grace, nor Indu&s;try to make u&s;e of it, I mean our Fi&s;h, thus we &s;tarve with that Commodity at our Doors, from which our Neighbours the <HI>Dutch</HI> draw the very Foundations of their Wealth and Maritime Power; Will you then &s;till be fond of that ill Government and Management which even deprives you of the Provi&s;ion that Indulgent Nature has thrown into your Mouths, But &s;ome will &s;ay, has not our Con|vention of Burrows Cho&s;en Men, Skil'd in the deepe&s;t My&s;teries of Trade, of Eminent Abilities and greater In|tegrity, have not they told us that the Trade of <HI>Eng|land</HI> is <HI>Un&s;upportable,</HI> that is, Untollerable, not to be endured, which is as much as if they had &s;aid, we have not Grandeur of Soul to Support &s;o great Wealth and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Pro&s;perity, we mu&s;t be Contented to Live like Pedlers, whil'&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants Live like Princes? <HI>Where is now your Pride? Where is now your boa&s;tings?</HI> But &s;ay you again, the &s;ame Convention of Burrows, not not le&s;s Skilled in Politicks than in Trade; have told us that the Trade of <HI>England</HI> is Precarious. It is hard to An&s;wer all the Unrea&s;onable Fears and Jealou&s;ies of Peo|ple. Has <HI>Wales</HI> &s;ince their Union, ever Complained of the Breach of one Article? Is there any one Privilege that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> Enjoy's, which a <HI>Welchman</HI> is De|prived off? Do all the other Counties Unite to Oppre&s;s <HI>York&s;hire?</HI> There are indeed &s;ome unequalities of Taxes among&s;t them&s;elves, wherein they have thought fit not to depart from a Rule once E&s;tabli&s;h'd; But this is &s;o &s;ar from being a Di&s;couragement to <HI>Scotland,</HI> That 'tis their greate&s;t Security, it &s;hows how unwilling and un|capable a Parliament is, to Recede from <HI>Quota</HI>'s already Settled, tho' unequal: Be&s;ides Matters in a free Go|vernment never go with that Unanimity, nor in a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Parliament, will Parties ever be &s;o unequally trim'd, that it will not be in the Power of a le&s;&s;er Num|ber than the <HI>Scots</HI> Members, to Ca&s;t the Ballance, and if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from Oppre&s;&s;ion, and 'tis highly probable, that the Party of the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> who are under Tax'd, after an Union will be much Strengthn'd. I &s;hall add no more on this head, but that <HI>England</HI> has Oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Scotland</HI> Ten times more, &s;ince the Union of the Two Crowns, than ever they will be able to do after the Union of the Two Parlia|ments, But &s;ays the &s;ame Ingenious Convention to &s;how their Skill in Political Arthmetick, the Taxes of <HI>England</HI> are <HI>Un&s;upportable;</HI> To this I An&s;wer, That it was hard|ly
<PB N="9" REF="8">
ever known, that a Nation was affraid of high Cu|&s;toms upon their Import and Con&s;umpt; when did that ever ruin any People? That is ju&s;t as if a Man &s;hould complain that he could not be Rich becau&s;e he has not leave to &s;pend his Money; or that he will not accept of a Laird&s;hip for fear of paying two Months Ce&s;s. With tho&s;e intolerable Cu&s;toms the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants live higher, and acquire much greater Riches than ours do. As for the Land Tax, it can hardly ever be higher, and will be often nothing or much lower than what we now pay. Indeed the Encrea&s;e of Trade will be attended with an Encrea&s;e of Exci&s;e, and the Benefit of the one will be much greater than the Damage of the other; but then the Effect will not exceed the Cau&s;e, with this advantage, that all that is rai&s;ed by the Publick be|yond the pre&s;ent Sum, by the <HI>Articles of the Treaty,</HI> is to remain in the Country: If after all you &s;hould want Money to pay your Taxes, I can propo&s;e no better Ex|pedient than that of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Launcb out into the Deep and let down your Nets,</HI> and you may fetch your Tribute Money out of your Fi&s;hes; for after an Union you will have Stock to Employ your People to Catch them, and Vent for them when they are Catched.</P>
<P>Another Objection is, <HI>That an Union with</HI> England <HI>will draw our People out of</HI> Scotland, <HI>to the Metropolis of the Government, and to the Plantations;</HI> To which I an|&s;wer, That after an Union there are many Rea&s;ons, and Inducements for our People to &s;tay at Home, that do not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the pre&s;ent State, but not any one (&s;aving their attendance in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament) to draw them Abroad; how many People at pre&s;ent leave their Country for want of Employment, (I may &s;ay for want
<PB N="10" REF="9">
of Bread) is evident to every body that knows either <HI>Scotland,</HI> or other Countries where multitudes of <HI>Scots</HI> are to be met with; nay I appeal to every Family in the Kingdom, if they have not Relations abroad, &s;ome where, or another, and this is the chief Cau&s;e, why <HI>Scotland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Health, Temperance and Fruitfulne&s;s of the Inhabitants, is under Peopled: Now is it not extreamly probable that the Encrea&s;e of Trade, would employ and keep many at Home, that are now forc'd to &s;eek their Bread in foreign Countries, and not only &s;o, but when the re&s;traint of the Laws of Trade, is taken off, the cheapne&s;s of Living and Manufacture, will invite People from other Parts into <HI>Scotland;</HI> par|ticularly the <HI>Scots</HI> who are now &s;ettled in the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> would chu&s;e to purcha&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h their Fami|lies in their own Country, not being any more re&s;trai|ned by Acts of Navigation, from the returning their Effects thither. 2<HI>dly.</HI> If any <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> at pre&s;ent has a mind to &s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> the minute he &s;ets his Foot on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ground, he has the Privileges of an <HI>Engli&s;h|man:</HI> What then can intice him to leave his own Coun|try after an Union, more than before? I &s;hould imagine he would be le&s;s tempted to do &s;o, becau&s;e he can then have the &s;ame Privileges of Trade, and all other Immu|nities in &s;taying at Home, which now he cannot have without going into <HI>England.</HI> If you &s;ay, that after an Union, his acce&s;s to Preferment in the publick Stations of the Government, and con&s;equently his Temptations to go to <HI>London,</HI> will be greater? That, is an advan|tage, for then he goes to get an E&s;tate, and not to &s;pend one, and he will readily Purcha&s;e in his own Country. If our Gentry and Nobility have a mind to
<PB N="11" REF="10">
&s;pend their E&s;tates at <HI>London,</HI> I know no Law at pre&s;ent that re&s;trains them, only nece&s;&s;ity which has no Law? That indeed after an Union may be le&s;s, many of our Nobility and Gentry, are now continually at <HI>London,</HI> a few to Govern, &s;ome to Oppre&s;s, many to Complain, and all for Strife and Contention; and &s;uppo&s;e by their attendance on a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, the Numbers of tho&s;e &s;hould be doubled, <HI>Scotland</HI> gets little by an Uni|on, if it is not able to di&s;charge the Expence of Thirty Noblemen and Gentlemen, at the rate of 2000 <HI>l. &s;terl.</HI> a Man, and perhapes the times may not be &s;o hard, but &s;ome of them will carry more down than they brought up</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have fully An&s;wered this Objection, which is &s;o far from being of any weight, that I mu&s;t entreat you, by the Kindne&s;s and natural Affection you bear to your dear Children and Relations, by the Com|fort of their Society, and having them e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong&s;t your &s;elves in a flowri&s;hing Condition; by the Ca&s;ualties and Dangers, and by the unfortunate and fatal End, which their &s;trowling into foreign Countries often expo&s;es them to: By all the&s;e moving Arguments, I be&s;eech you to Embrace &s;o fair an Opportunity of ma|king them and your &s;elves Happy for Ages to come; for as the wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 29. &amp; 24. <HI>It is a mi&s;e|rable life to go from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, for where thou art a Stranger thou dare&s;t not opea thy Mouth; thou &s;hall Enter|tain and Fea&s;t and have no Thanks: Moreover thou &s;hall hear bitter Words, the&s;e things are grieveous to a Man of Under&s;tanding.</HI> Thus I have gone throw my fir&s;t Head, and have prov'd that as clearly as the Sun &s;hines at Noon|day, and I call the &s;ame Sun to Witne&s;s again&s;t your
<PB N="12" REF="11">
matchle&s;s Ignorance and Stupidity, if you reject &s;o fa|vourable an offer of <HI>Liberty, Peace and Plenty.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to the &s;econd Part of my Text, which is, your boa&s;ting of your <HI>Soveraignty, mu&s;t we loo&s;e That? mu&s;t we be no more a Kingdom?</HI> In the fir&s;t place, I would ask any rea&s;onable Man, Do we lo&s;e our Soveraignty in any other Sen&s;e, than <HI>England</HI> does? Is there not a new Title, new Seal, new Arms; and the &s;ame chan|ges for them as for us: <HI>For I take an Incorporating Uni|on to be, as if two pieces of Mettal, were melted down into one Ma&s;s, neither can be &s;aid to retain its former Form or Sub&s;tance, as it did before the Mixture.</HI> We can never be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to pretend to an equal Number of Repre&s;entatives in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, when two Na|tions join in a common A&s;&s;embly, the mo&s;t Powerful and mo&s;t Numerous, &s;till will be the mo&s;t Powerfull and mo&s;t Numerous; whatever Mettal exceeded before the Mixture, the &s;ame will exceed in the Ma&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble to change the Nature of Things; according to this way of rea&s;oning, it is not only impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>Scotland</HI> ever to Unite with <HI>England,</HI> but for any le&s;&s;er Nation ever to Unite with a greater: Why is it more Di&s;honourable for <HI>Scotland</HI> to Unite with <HI>England,</HI> than it is for <HI>Eng|land</HI> to Unite with <HI>Scotland?</HI> What is it that <HI>Scotland</HI> loo&s;es? The Country, the People, are not Annihilated, nor does an Union cau&s;e that all the worthy Deeds, that have been done at any time by the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, or <HI>Scot&s;man,</HI> are undone. A <HI>Welchman,</HI> would take it ve|ry unkindly, if we &s;hould tell him that by his Union with <HI>England,</HI> he has &s;ulli'd the Glory and Antiquity of the ancient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Race: None can have a greater va|lue for noble Atchievements and Honour of our Ance|&s;tors,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
than I have; but as for our Independency, &s;o much boa&s;ted of, tho it be mo&s;t certainly true in it &s;elf, and undeniable in Law, as well as ju&s;tifiable from Hi|&s;tory, yet at pre&s;ent, it is in effect only Precarious Ima|ginary and Fanta&s;tical, and is no more than the Privi|lege to be Govern'd by a Mini&s;try under foreign Influ|ence; which I &s;ay not to in&s;inuate the lea&s;t Reflection on our pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, who have the Honour to Act a great part, in putting an end to a Grievance &s;o much complain'd of, a Ble&s;&s;ing perhaps in vain to be expected or lookt for at another time: Can any Man be &s;o de&s;ti|tude of common Sen&s;e, as to think his <HI>Liberty and Pro|perty,</HI> more &s;afely and more honourably lodg'd in &s;uch Hands, than in tho&s;e of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament: Now in lieu of this titular Soveraignty, and imaginary Inde|pendency, by an Union you acquire true and &s;olid Po|wer and Dominion, to have Sixty Members in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament; the twelfth &s;hare of di&s;po&s;ing of 6000000 <HI>l.</HI> of Money, which is the &s;ame with the &s;ole Power of di&s;po&s;ing of 500000, to have your Fleets and Armies Conquering Abroad, the Arbitration of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> your &s;elves Repre&s;ented in foreign Courts and A&s;&s;emblies; when had Sixty <HI>Scot&s;men</HI> Affairs of that Im|portance laid before them? To have your Nobility Peers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with their Per&s;ons and Reputations Sacred over the I&s;land, and their Lives only &s;ubject to the Inque&s;t of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Lords; to have your Quota of the mo&s;t eminent Po&s;ts of the Government of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> are not the&s;e things Sub&s;tantial, Power and Dominion, preferable to the Triffles you now en|joy, be&s;ides that the value of tho&s;e will be encrea&s;ed, and is it not more eligible to have &s;uch a &s;hare, both of
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the Government of your &s;elves, and of <HI>England,</HI> than to be managed by Favourites, often contrary to your mo&s;t apparent Int're&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>But all the&s;e Advantages may be obtain'd by a Faederal Union &s;ome &s;ay;</HI> it is an amazing thing, to con&s;ider how People are Banter'd out of their Common Sen&s;e, with meer Names and Chimeras, to avoid Multiplicity of Words, by a Faederal Union, I &s;uppo&s;e is meant that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould Barter their Trade, for our Settling of their Succe&s;&s;or, I would de&s;ire any Man who thinks &s;uch a bargain feazible to make the following Reflecti|ons; in any Vote that ever pa&s;t yet in <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t the Settling the Succe&s;&s;ion, whether he thinks that <HI>England</HI> could not Purcha&s;e the Majority of that Differ|ence, at a Cheaper Rate, than the Liberty of their Trade and Plantations, let them ask the Con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who Voted again&s;t the Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;i|on, if the hopes of a Faederal Union, was the Motive that induc'd them to do &s;o? Let them ask tho&s;e that Vo|ted for it, if they will Vote &s;o no more till they have obtain'd it, to &s;how how un-&s;incerly they deal, who make this their pretence. Many of the&s;e very Gentle|men will be Contented to Settle the Succe&s;&s;ion on any Terms; But 2<HI>ly.</HI> Where is there &s;uch a Faederal Uni|on betwixt two Nations, without a Common A&s;&s;embly? The Confederated Provinces, and the Confederated Can|tons have one where the Repre&s;entatives of all the par|ticular Bodies meet, 3<HI>dly.</HI> Can any Man believe, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will mantain Plantations, Garri&s;on them, and Defend them with their Fleets and Armies, to let <HI>Scots</HI> who are at none of the&s;e Charges reap the Pro|fite of the Trade, will they E&s;tabli&s;h Cu&s;toms and Du|ties,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
as the Rule of their Export Abroad, and Con&s;um|ption at Home, and &s;uffer the <HI>Scots</HI> to Trade without any Rule of Cu&s;toms, or no Cu&s;toms, High, or Low as they plea&s;e, if they would do this, it were no hard matter to have the Monopoly of their Trade, this were a mo&s;t Precious Jewel indeed, and very well worth contending for. But if &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be thought unrea&s;onable, I would de&s;ire in the next place to know, how a commone expence, in Mantaining and Providing for Forts, Plantations and Factories, can be Carried on, without a common The&s;aury and Govern|ment. <HI>And La&s;tly,</HI> if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould allow us &s;uch a Priviledge, can we be &s;ecure of it, without we have our Repre&s;entatives in their Parliament, to take care of our Intere&s;t? And can any man of Sen&s;e think, that we &s;hould be more un&s;ecure of our Priviledges, when we have Members in their A&s;&s;embly, than when we have none, when we are Dome&s;ticks, than when we are Strangers? In the former ca&s;e, nothing de&s;troies our Privileges but what di&s;&s;olves the Union, for it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that all the other Counties &s;hould Unite to hinder a <HI>York</HI> Shire Man to Trade to the Plan|tations, when the Riches he acquires by his Trade, goes to the Support of the Government, of which they them|&s;elves are Members, in the ca&s;e of one Nation, and one People, it is indifferent to the Supreme Power, in what part of Great <HI>Britain</HI> their Riches ly.</P>

I deal with you as rea&s;onable Men, and have purpo&s;e|ly in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch Arguments, as are obvious to the meane&s;t Under&s;tanding. I Conclude with a general Ex|hortation to all Ranks and Degrees of People, to pro|mote this Good Work, it is manife&s;tly the Intere&s;t of you Landed-Men for the Encrea&s;e of Trade and Manu|facture, will double, yea triple, the value of your E&s;tates, by rai&s;ing the Price of the Product, and the num|ber of the Purcha&s;&s;ers; be&s;ides, your Lands being gene|rally in the wor&s;t Repair, that is, the mo&s;t improveable Condition, and your Security by the u&s;e of a Regi&s;ter, the be&s;t in the I&s;land. No doubt after the re&s;traint of Laws is taken off, Strangers will be encouraged to Pur|cha&s;e among you: Why then will you chu&s;e to live in a mi&s;erable moyling Condition, paying high Intere&s;t for Money, which Land-Rents cannot Di&s;charge, ha|ving no way to di&s;po&s;e of your younger Children, but by &s;ending them abroad into the wide World to &s;eek their Fortunes; whereas after the Conclu&s;ion of this great Affair, you will have opportunities to employ them in Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and acce&s;s (according to Merit) to the be&s;t Po&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> As for you <HI>Tennents,</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity of your Ma&s;ters, is the occa&s;ion of your Poverty, Trade will enable them to let longer Lea&s;es and you to take them, and conform you in time to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms, where Ma&s;ters govern a free People, and are duly payed their Rents, and Tennents enjoy what remains with equal Security.

Where there are Hands to Work, and Simples to work upon, and Vent for the Manufacture, it is impo&s;&s;ible but there mu&s;t be Trade, if our own Stock is not &s;ufficient, you will be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that of <HI>England,</HI> the very novelty of the thing will in &s;ome mea&s;ure contribute to this, for all the Branches of Traf|fique in <HI>England,</HI> being Traded bare, where there are new Subjects of Trade, Merchants will try new Pro|jects, their Intere&s;t will never &s;uffer them to be partial to this, or that Country, but will &s;end their Money where they can have the be&s;t Bargain.

<P>You &s;ee the Objections u&s;ed by the Oppo&s;ers of an Union, are either frivolous, founded upon gro&s;s Fal&s;|hoods, or do plainly prove the contrary of what they are adduced for; and I have that opinion of the Under|der&s;tanding of &s;everal of the Anti-Uniters, that they do not &s;o much as convince them&s;elves, they are only a Vail drawn over your Eyes to hide from you your pre&s;ent Poverty and Slavery, and the glorious Pro&s;pect which an Union with <HI>England</HI> pre&s;ents you with; you are u&s;ed only as Tools and Machines, to bring about their facti|ous and ambitious De&s;igns: However I &s;hall be&s;eech all &s;uch Gentlemen and Per&s;ons of Quality, to con&s;ider that it is not a &s;light Matter to &s;acrifice the pre&s;ent and future Pro&s;perity of their Country, to an unrea&s;onable

Humor, to make a numerous People and their Po&s;terity, Beggars and Slaves for Ages to come, and perhapes their Country a field of Blood, by endeavouring to en|tall this upon their Neighbours, as well as them&s;elves; or if they are &s;way'd with &s;ome Rea&s;on of le&s;s impor|tance, as the Treaty not being of their own Framing, I de&s;ire them to con&s;ider, that this is &s;o very Childi&s;h, that a Senator &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to own it, if the pretty little Ma&s;ters, their Children &s;hould take their Fathers places in Parliament, &s;uch a Rea&s;on would hardly be allowed to pa&s;s current among them: An Union is a Matter of great Weight and Importance, and very Good, or Bad, in it &s;elf; if it is a bad Thing, our mo&s;t intimate Friends the Treaters, can never recommend it? If it is a good Thing, it is &s;o great a Good, that we ought not to refu&s;e it, from tho&s;e again&s;t whom our per|&s;onal Re&s;entments run highe&s;t. Among the Oppo&s;ers of the Union, I know a great many Per&s;ons of Honour, who have as true a Sen&s;e of Liberty, and as great a concern for the Well are of their Country, as any &s;uch need, only lay a&s;ide &s;ome &s;ew Prejudices and Reflections, their Judgments will quickly inform them of the true value of the Propo&s;al. To &s;uch as are affraid of the Church and Religion, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the Religi|on of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is impos'd upon no Man within the Dominions of <HI>England;</HI> as for the &s;queemi&s;h|ne&s;s of &s;itting in Parliament with Prelates, and the fear of being Di&s;arm'd of all other Weapons but what are al|lowed by the Go&s;pel; the&s;e are &s;uch unchri&s;tian Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ives from an Union, that to mention them only, is to refute them. The putting an end to uncharitable and unrea&s;onable Divi&s;ions about our triffling Differences in

In a word, if any unju&s;t Tyranny over the Per&s;ons, E&s;tates, or Con&s;ciences of Men, be the Motive, which prevail with &s;ome to op|po&s;e this Union, I would have &s;uch con&s;ider, that to Govern a free People, is a more noble and honourable Character, than to In&s;ult over Slaves and Beggars, and if any &s;uch there be, who hug their Chains, and are fond of their Raggs, and as a wretched People once did by the <HI>Romans</HI> refu&s;e their Liberty when offered, they are unworthy of &s;o generous and beneficial a Propo&s;al.
