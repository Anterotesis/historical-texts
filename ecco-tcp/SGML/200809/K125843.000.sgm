<HEAD>THE Rogui&s;h MILLER;
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
OR, Nothing got by Cheating.
A TRUE BALLAD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Miller there was, and he liv'd at his Mill,</L>
<L>Which was built on a &s;tream at the foot of a hill.</L>
<L>He cheated all day and he drank all the night,</L>
<L>For cheating and drinking was all his delight;</L>
<L>While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll,</L>
<L>This &s;till was his &s;aying&mdash;be &s;ure to take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whoever &s;ent corn to be ground at his Mill,</L>
<L>He &s;poilt it, he chang'd it, he pilfer'd it &s;till;</L>
<L>In villainy thus a long cour&s;e he did run,</L>
<L>For he fancy'd that cheating was very good fun.</L>
<L>He car'd not what came of his body or &s;oul,</L>
<L>While this was his &s;aying&mdash;I'll always take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you &s;ent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill,</L>
<L>A Sack of bad flour he &s;ent you back &s;till,</L>
<L>For he fancy'd that when he the wheat had once ground,</L>
<L>The difference wou'd not be ea&s;ily found:</L>
<L>Now to change good for bad was as if he had &s;tole,</L>
<L>And he not only chang'd it&mdash;but always took toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Neighbours oft &s;ent him their Money to pay,</L>
<L>But he always refus'd it and &s;ent it away;</L>
<L>Had he taken the Money he'd have got but his due,</L>
<L>But the payment that's lawful for him wou'd not do;</L>
<L>What was hone&s;tly his he de&s;pis'd on the whole,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e he got more from&mdash;the taking of toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One day when a Farmer had &s;ent a good &s;ack</L>
<L>Of his Corn to be ground, and then &s;ent for it back;</L>
<L>He call'd to his Man and demanded &s;traitway,</L>
<L>If for this he had taken the toll on that day.</L>
<L>The Man &s;trait declar'd, that tho' nought he had &s;tole,</L>
<L>Yet that he had taken&mdash;the full of the toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He then call'd his maid, and he a&s;k'd her good lack</L>
<L>If toll &s;he had taken from that very &s;ack;</L>
<L>She declar'd that &s;he had, but he fond of pelf,</L>
<L>Said, for fear that you &s;hou'd not, I'll take it my&s;elf;</L>
<L>So ra&s;hly he ventur'd the lo&s;s of his Soul,</L>
<L>And mended his practice&mdash;by thrice taking toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length he grew bolder and bolder in &s;in,</L>
<L>And cheating he deeper and deeper got in;</L>
<L>Of Satan, alas! he was quite at the beck,</L>
<L>Where he fir&s;t took a pound he at length took a peck,</L>
<L>No church he frequented to pray for his Soul,</L>
<L>Who wou'd might go thither&mdash;&s;o he could take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Farmer, the Squire, the Par&s;on likewi&s;e</L>
<L>Agreed to ob&s;erve him with &s;till keener Eyes;</L>
<L>But the Ju&s;tice he cheated to &s;uch a degree,</L>
<L>That no longer with patience his frauds cou'd he &s;ee;</L>
<L>So he &s;ent him to jail by the LAW's ju&s;t controul,</L>
<L>And a MITTIMUS paid him&mdash;for taking of toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come all hone&s;t Millers whoever you be,</L>
<L>And li&s;ten to coun&s;el that's given by me;</L>
<L>Be content, like fair trade&s;men with moderate gains,</L>
<L>And look for a lawful reward of your pains;</L>
<L>If 'tis paid you in money be pleas'd on the whole</L>
<L>And if you take any&mdash;take moderate toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! &s;eek not each way to defraud that you can,</L>
<L>Nor cheat in the flour, nor cheat in the bran;</L>
<L>Be hone&s;t and all Men will flock to your Mill,</L>
<L>And tho' others want cu&s;tom, yours ne'er will &s;tand &s;till.</L>
<L>And when to your MAKER you give up your &s;oul,</L>
<L>You'll rejoice that you always&mdash;took moderate toll.</L>
