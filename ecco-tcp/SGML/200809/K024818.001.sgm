<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WORKS of imagination have ever been the ornament of civilized nations. The progre&s;s from barbari&s;m to politene&s;s is al|ways accompanied by a &s;imilar gra|dation in the perfection of literary amu&s;ements. The ea&s;ie&s;t, con&s;e|quently the earlie&s;t, of the&s;e amu&s;e|ments was fable: among the vari|ous kinds of which, the narrative, as the mo&s;t &s;imple and natural, was the fir&s;t. In the ruder ages men li&s;tened, with avidity, to tales of the utmo&s;t &s;implicity&punc; the &s;tory of the Belly and the Members could calm the rage of a mutinous people.
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
Writers who wi&s;h, at pre&s;ent, to teach Morality by fiction, have greater difficulties to encounter: the &s;hallow artifices of the wolf, the fox, and the lion are too ea&s;ily di&s;cover|ed, and are only, now, devoted to the in&s;truction and recreation of children. Character, incident, de|&s;ign, diction, probability, &amp;c. are requi&s;ite to attract the attention of readers, beyond a certain &s;phere. It would be, perhaps, a u&s;ele&s;s, as well as a difficult ta&s;k to di&s;cover, whether the ancients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any &s;pecies of writing that may be cla&s;&s;ed with what is meant by the word Novel. The want of a quality which &s;eems peculiar to modern Europe, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of GALLANTRY, mu&s;t have
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
given &s;uch compo&s;itions a turn very different from the productions of the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>IN the dark ages, when bigotry and zeal had, almo&s;t, obliterated every trace of ancient literature, the only writings, meant for amu&s;e|ment, were the legends of &s;aints; in which the marvellous was, alone, predominant. Secure from criti|ci&s;m, by the tremendous alliance be|tween their works and THE FAITH, the more improbable the &s;tory, the greater was its merit, with this &s;pe|cies of writers. Their imaginations thus emancipated, their &s;aints be|came warriors, the extravagant fa|bles of the old poets were out-done, and the champions of Chri&s;tendom rivalled the worthies of Greece.
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
They overcame mon&s;ters and gi|ants; pur&s;ued necromancers through lakes of fire; till by their prowe&s;s, and prayers, they &s;ent the inchanters, bla&s;pheming through the air, on the backs of fiery dragons, and made their ca&s;tles vani&s;h. The&s;e authors &s;eem to have had a confu&s;ed idea of the Grecian fables: a &s;imi|larity to the Cyclops, Hydras, Mino|taurs, Syrens and Circes, may ea&s;ily be traced. The Phoenicians, Egyp|tians, Libyans, Grecians, Gauls, each had a Hercules, who perform|ed wonderful, and impo&s;&s;ible things. The monks invented one for the Chri&s;tians; only they called him St. George. But as he was, more par|ticularly, the hero of England, by being its tutelary &s;aint, each power|ful
<PB N="v" REF="7">
&s;tate was allotted a champion. One of the&s;e, St. Dennis for France, Voltaire has made a principal per|&s;onage in the machinery of his Hen|riade.</P>
<P>THESE miraculous tales were &s;uc|ceeded by romances of voluminous magnitude, in which the pa&s;&s;ion of love was drawn in the mo&s;t hyper|bolical manner; &s;uch were Clelia, the grand Cyrus, &amp;c. A &s;amene&s;s of character, of incident, of lan|guage, pervaded the whole. Plot they had none, and but one moral di&s;|tributed through the endle&s;s pages of endle&s;s volumes: yet the&s;e were the entertainment of the gay and the polite, and were held in e&s;timation &s;o late as at the end of the la&s;t cen|tury.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8">MODERN writers u&s;e the word Romance, to &s;ignify a fictitious hi&s;|tory of detached and independent adventures; and, under that idea, call the Telemaque of Fenelon, and the Cyrus of Ram&s;ay, Romances. Le S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge's Gil Blas, and Smollet's Roderick Random, though of a dif|ferent &s;pecies, come under the &s;ame denomination. A Novel is another kind of work. Unity of de&s;ign is its character. In a Romance, if the incidents be well marked and re|lated with &s;pirit, the intention is an&s;wered; and adventures pa&s;s be|fore the view for no other purpo&s;e than to amu&s;e by their peculiarity, without, perhaps, affecting the main &s;tory, if there &s;hould be one. But in a Novel, a combination of inci|dents,
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
entertaining in them&s;elves, are made to form a whole; and an unnece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance becomes a blemi&s;h, by detaching from the &s;implicity which is requi&s;ite to ex|hibit that whole to advantage. Thus, as in dramatic works, tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which do not tend, either to the illu&s;tration, or forwarding the main &s;tory, or, which do not mark &s;ome character, or per&s;on in the drama, are to be e&s;teemed unnece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, the legitimate Novel is a work much more difficult than the Romance, and ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be ranked with tho&s;e dramatic pieces who&s;e utility is generally al|lowed. Novels have fallen into di&s;repute. Love-&s;ick girls and boys
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only per&s;ons capable of being amu&s;ed by them: and, while a poverty of &s;tile, a want of knowledge of the human heart, of men and manners; while a puny tale of love and misfortune, cro&s;s fathers, and unhappy children, un|natural rigour, and unaccountable reconciliation, without di&s;crimina|tion of character, without variety of incident, with but one &s;et of phra&s;es, one languid, inanimate de|&s;cription, with &s;carce a &s;ingle ray of imagination to comfort the di&s;con|&s;olate reader, are their great cha|racteri&s;tics, Novels &s;hall continue to want admirers: but Tom Jones &s;hall never want admirers.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. Mr. ALWYN to Mr. HILKIRK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HILKIRK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received a letter from our old &s;chool-fellow Pendril, who &s;aw you as he pa&s;&s;ed through Car|li&s;le. I need not tell you it gave me great plea&s;ure to hear that you &s;till exi&s;t in health and &s;pirits, after the cha&s;m which your ab&s;ence has occa&s;ioned in
<PB N="2" REF="19">
our friend&s;hip; and though your &s;itua|tion, as a travelling comedian, is &s;uch as &s;ome of your old acquaintance would not be over ready to recognize you under, yet, were I weak enough to be thus in|fluenced, the affectation in me would not only be mean, but ridiculous. My hereditary hopes do not &s;urpa&s;s your's; and, could certain con&s;iderations be re|moved, I don't know but it might be more agreeable to my &s;entiments (call it pride if you plea&s;e) to live by my own labour, than by that of the dead&mdash; I am not unacquainted with the natural hilarity and chearfulne&s;s of your temper, and I am of opinion that (no matter what the rank in life) while the mind is chearful, the man is happy.&mdash;Cincin|natus at the plough, it is mo&s;t probable, was happier than Cincinnatus in the &s;e|nate&mdash;I know you begin to &s;u&s;pect this grave lecture: few, I believe, preach about
<PB N="3" REF="20">
happine&s;s, till they them&s;elves either are, or have been unhappy&mdash;I own to you I am altered. The &s;miles and plea&s;ures are fled; a gloom overhangs my youth, and has &s;hut out the &s;un; my health declines, and my worthy Patron&mdash;(Patron?&mdash;Friend! &mdash;Father!&mdash;all the&s;e cannot expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e I have of his goodne&s;s) wi&s;hes me to re&s;ide in the country for &s;ome time.&mdash; I wi&s;h it my&s;elf&mdash;I cannot be ea&s;y where I am&mdash;my di&s;order will increa&s;e&mdash;Not that I am anxious about life&mdash;it is a com|fort that, &s;ooner or later, all our cares &s;hall end: and no &s;entiment ever came with greater force to me than that which Mac|beth, where the poet repre&s;ents him torn and di&s;tracted with a thou&s;and fears, thus utters:
<Q><L>Better be with the dead</L>
<L>Than on the torture of the mind to lie</L>
<L><HI>In re&s;tle&s;s exta&s;y.</HI>&mdash;Duncan is in his grave&mdash;</L>
<L>After life's fitful fever he &s;leeps well.</L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="21">Malice dome&s;tic, foreign levy&mdash;<HI>Nothing</HI></L>
<L>Can touch him further.</L></Q>
The&s;e reflections are the cordials of my life. Enough of this.</P>
<P>You will be &s;urprized, perhaps, when I tell you that I have an inclination to become an actor. Hear my rea&s;ons: I mu&s;t either find a means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or live upon the bounty of others. The fir&s;t is agreeable to me; the latter I can never con&s;ent to, though Mr. Stamford would &s;upply me with the greate&s;t chear|fulne&s;s. As it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould live &s;ome time in the country, I can think of no &s;cheme &s;o eligible as this; and &s;hall be glad if you will enquire of your brother comedians, whether they are willing to admit me of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I DO not mean to inform my ma&s;ter of my intention; none but &s;uch as I
<PB N="5" REF="22">
approve need know of my &s;ituation; which, I confe&s;s, I &s;hall be almo&s;t a&s;hamed of: I &s;hould, however, be more a&s;hamed to be idle; and the coun|try affords no other &s;ource of employ|ment to me. Our mutual and early friend&s;hip is another inducement.</P>
<P>SHOULD you perceive any thing im+proper, either in the application to your brother comedians, or from any other circum&s;tance, let not this be any re|&s;traint, but act agreeably to rea&s;on and your own feelings, which will be both approved and applauded by one who is perfectly con&s;cious of the delicacy and propriety of them, and who is proud to have the honour of &s;ub&s;cribing him&s;elf</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Mr. HILKIRK to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your letter, and, I believe, I need not take much pains to de&s;cribe to you the plea&s;ure I enjoy from this in&s;tance of the continuance of your at|tachment. The bitter has &s;o far pre|dominated over the &s;weet, during my peregrination in this vile world, that I begin already to have a large proportion of cynical e&s;&s;ence in my compo&s;ition, though not enough to overpower the plea&s;ure I receive in Alwyn's friend&s;hip. You will readily believe this, when you recollect the avidity with which I always &s;ought your company, and the delight I took in it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="24">I AM &s;orry to ob&s;erve the air of me|lancholy &s;o prevalent in your epi&s;tle&mdash;it is not natural to you. The lines of de|&s;pair are marked &s;trongly in your mind &mdash;it is beneath you&mdash;you that have ta&s;ted friend&s;hip from all, &s;miles from all, love from all. 'Tis enough for wretches like me, outca&s;ts from &s;ociety, to indulge the gloom: but I am above it. Is the weather cloudy? I tune my pipe; no matter where, the cottage or the palace: 'tis hard if I don't find &s;ome|body to dance.&mdash;Does the &s;un &s;hine? let me enjoy the &s;miles of the &s;ea&s;on while I can. My mu&s;ic is flown to the fields, I follow it; it warbles from the thorn, it tinkles in the tears of the wandering brook, it mourns in the plain|tive &s;ong of the widowed linnet&mdash;Let it&mdash;'tis mu&s;ic &s;till, and mu&s;ic only will I bear. Does the &s;leet of contempt bat|ter my face, or the biting fro&s;t of di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="8" REF="25">
a&s;&s;ault my feelings?&mdash;I am prepared better than Moor, of Moor-hall, for the dragon&mdash;I have armour of iam|bics, a &s;hield of raillery, and a &s;word of &s;atire, more powerful than the &s;word of my old a&s;&s;ociate harlequin. I &s;end a herald in the form of a goo&s;e-quill, <Q>to hurl defiance in their teeth.</Q> Tragic, comic, and farcical &s;cenes are exhibited continually on the world's great theatre; their frequency has made them familiar, and I re&s;olve henceforth to be rather a &s;pectator than an actor: I have played the fool in the farce too often.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry that I &s;hall not have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, having agreed to take upon me the management of a com|pany that travels in the we&s;t, and being to &s;et off, the day after to-morrow, to Taunton, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, whither my
<PB N="9" REF="26">
baggage is already gone. I have &s;poken to our manager re&s;pecting your coming hither; and, from the de&s;cription I have given of your per&s;on and abilities, he is anxious to &s;ee you, and declares you are the very man he wants. The company go from hence to Kendal the next week, and he is de&s;irous of meeting you there, to open the hou&s;e. Had I known your intention before I made this new engage|ment, I &s;hould have been happy in an opportunity of renewing our friend&s;hip per&s;onally; as it is, I mu&s;t content my|&s;elf with the plea&s;ure of a frequent cor|re&s;pondence, which I hope you will have no objection to.</P>
<P>'TIS long &s;ince I have had the plea&s;ure of your conver&s;ation; accident has con|tinued to deprive me of it. To en|courage you to a corre&s;pondence, to
<PB N="10" REF="27">
which I have invited you, I will relate the hi&s;tory of my adventures, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that they will not prove en|tirely unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>JILTED by a girl, abandoned by my friend, my unprovided bark pu&s;hed from the &s;trand by a violent pa&s;&s;ion for an unworthy object, whom yet I can &s;carce forbear to love, into dangerous and un|known &s;eas, no wary pilot to direct my cour&s;e, I ignorantly ran on lee &s;hores, al|lured by promi&s;ing appearances; and, to &s;tretch my metaphor, pre&s;ently became a wreck among &s;avages, in a &s;trange land.&mdash;<Q>By the waters of Babylon I &s;at down and wept.</Q></P>
<P>IT is now near four years &s;ince I left London and my companions; at which period I was &s;carce twenty, and you not above eighteen; &s;o that though we u&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="28">
to amu&s;e our&s;elves in our conver&s;ation, long before, upon rational &s;ubjects, yet having little care about the future for|tune of our lives, we did not enquire much into each others views. It is not the character of that age to be very &s;o|licitous about to-morrow. I &s;hall there|fore relate &s;uch incidents as are nece&s;&s;ary to form the connection of my little hi&s;|tory, le&s;t it &s;hould el&s;e be unintelligible.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal circum&s;tances in my life which, were they methodi&s;ed, properly &s;pun out, and interlarded with an epi&s;ode or two between Mr. Some|body and Mi&s;s Any-body, would fur|ni&s;h the circulating libraries with two hand&s;ome pocket volumes. The fir&s;t that I &s;hall mention, and not the lea&s;t extraordinary, is, that I am utterly ig|norant of my parents, or even whether I ever had a father or no. Excu&s;e this
<PB N="12" REF="29">
&s;tale attempt at a joke, and &s;uffer me to trifle with my mi&s;eries. I remember little of my infantine &s;tate, except be|ing bred among fields, farm-hou&s;es, and country pea&s;ants. I was removed from the&s;e, at an early age, to a cheap &s;chool in York&s;hire, where I continued till my fourteenth year; at which period the ma&s;ter informed me he could keep me no longer, for that the per&s;on who had placed me with him was dead, and my board and education already ten months in arrear; but that a London gentleman had enquired if he had any boy of good intellects among his &s;cholars who wanted a provi&s;ion; that he, the &s;choolma&s;ter, had recommended me, and, upon his recommendation, the gentleman had agreed to take me, provided I con&s;ented to go, which he advi&s;ed me by all means to do. The idea of being freed from the fear of birch, of which our good
<PB N="13" REF="30">
governor, upon every trivial mi&s;demea|nor, was as liberal as he was penurious in the articles of food and cloathing, to|gether with the hope of &s;eeing a city that I had heard &s;o wonderfully de|&s;cribed, operated &s;ufficiently on my fancy, to make me receive this propo|po&s;al with joy. I had not, however, lived &s;o many years with my play-mates, without having formed a few friend|&s;hips among them; but the&s;e, though they co&s;t me &s;ome tears at parting, were pre&s;ently forgot in the overflowings of a rapid imagination.</P>
<P>I ARRIVED with Mr. Seldon, my new patron and ma&s;ter, in London, the lat|ter end of October. You are not ig|norant of the character of this worthy man. He took me to his hou&s;e in Chancery-lane, where I underwent a long examination re&s;pecting my educa|tion.
<PB N="14" REF="31">
This was a &s;ource of flattery to me. I was univer&s;ally allowed the be&s;t &s;cholar in the &s;eminary from whence I had been taken, and, for three years pa&s;t, had been little obliged to my in|&s;tructors. Exclu&s;ive of the cla&s;&s;ics, I had made a tolerable &s;tride into mathe|matics, and had often &s;urpri&s;ed old De|clen&s;ion him&s;elf with philo&s;ophical ex|periments, which I had learnt from two or three books, that, till I conde&s;cended to look at them, had been neglected, and thrown about the &s;chool, among other lumber. I was the more power|fully induced to the&s;e exerci&s;es by the wonder they excited, and the fame I ac|quired. Mr. Seldon expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfaction at my progre&s;s; and, after paying me &s;ome compliments, told me he would now recommend other &s;ubjects to my notice.

civil rights of mankind, and in what manner they are pre&s;erved or injured by the laws exi&s;ting in this country, he &s;aid, would make me valuable to &s;ociety; and recommended me to the care of Mr. Turnbull, a man whom I am &s;ure you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, during your intimacy at our hou&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. SELDON was upwards of fifty, had no wife nor family, except Julia Gowland, an orphan niece, of about twelve years old, whom he had taken from a boarding-&s;chool, where he had placed her, being not only di&s;&s;atisfied with the oeconomy of the hou&s;e, but likewi&s;e de&s;irous of her company, and taking him&s;elf, in a great mea&s;ure, the care of inuring her to proper habits. His turn of thinking re&s;pecting educa|tion and habit was &s;ingular, yet, in my opinion, ju&s;t. Boys, he &s;aid, &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="33">
be &s;teeped in adver&s;ity, ca&s;e-hardened in mi&s;ery, during their youth; it gives them fortitude to &s;upport every change of fortune; it makes them &s;en&s;ible of the &s;implicity with which man ought to live; and &s;hews them the folly and real inutility of numberle&s;s things, which, by &s;ome, are deemed ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to exi&s;tence. It is the be&s;t &s;chool of morality to a &s;trong mind. Girls &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible how much mild|ne&s;s and re&s;ignation contribute to their happine&s;s; &s;hould be taught to &s;upport contradiction with chearfulne&s;s and &s;miles. This is the duty as much of man as wo|man; but it is the great &s;ource of plea|&s;ure to the latter. Hu&s;bands are en|chanted by mildne&s;s and acquie&s;cence from their wives; they feel their own &s;uperiority in point of &s;trength; they fancy it in point of under&s;tanding; their free commerce with the world, which is
<PB N="17" REF="34">
denied to the other &s;ex, together with the advantages of education, tend to confirm this opinion. Youths &s;hould endure hard&s;hips, but not be &s;uffered to &s;ink under them. Females &s;hould be taught the virtue and nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;till tongue, and a &s;miling countenance. Such were the &s;entiments of a man, who proved his wi&s;dom by the con&s;i&s;tency of his con|duct, and the order of his affairs.</P>
<P>THERE is in the boy and girl age a &s;u&s;ceptibility of attachment, which we afterwards lo&s;e, though with &s;ome re|gret. I had not been long in Mr. Sel|don's family, before Julia and I began reciprocally to feel a tender inclination; it did not immediately appear, though it in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed. We delighted, as lovers do, in mutual offices of kind|ne&s;s; we began to &s;igh, to langui&s;h, as our years increa&s;ed; and, before I was
<PB N="18" REF="35">
eighteen, I was deeply in love. Mr. Seldon did not at fir&s;t &s;eem &s;u&s;picious of the con&s;equence, but was plea&s;ed with the &s;implicity of our affection. Young as I was, I had &s;agacity enough to make this ob&s;ervation, and interpret|ed it to my own advantage. I am be|come a favourite, &s;aid I, my ma&s;ter loves me, and intends to give me his niece. The &s;equel will &s;hew how wretchedly I deceived my&s;elf.</P>
<P>EXCLUSIVE of my pa&s;&s;ion for Julia, I was not exempted from other youthful foibles; I loved dre&s;s, but, what was wor&s;e, I had addicted my&s;elf to a habit of frequenting a billiard-table. My de|light in the game &s;oon taught me to play tolerably; and the warmth of my temper not only engaged me to &s;port far beyond di&s;cretion, but made me an ea&s;y prey to much inferior game&s;ters with
<PB N="19" REF="36">
cooler heads; to which add my fond|ne&s;s for theatrical diver&s;ions, and my con&s;tant attendance at a &s;pouting-club, and you will ea&s;ily perceive the &s;eeds of misfortune, which have &s;ince &s;prung up &s;o thick, and the improbability of my continuing to enjoy the favour and pro|tection of Mr. Seldon.</P>
<P>MR. TURNBULL, the upper clerk, whom I mentioned, from my fir&s;t en|trance into the family appeared to have a particular partiality for me, and had taken almo&s;t as much pains in giving me proper advice as Mr. Seldon him&s;elf, without &s;eeming to regard my little de|viations from virtue with &s;o &s;evere an eye: but this man's conduct has been to me inexplicable. When any extra|vagancy had plunged me into a difficulty that affected my temper, and made it vi&s;ible, Turnbull would never let me
<PB N="20" REF="37">
re&s;t till I had acquainted him with the cau&s;e of my trouble, nor ever failed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, but then, I had great rea&s;on, from &s;everal hints, more particularly from my ma&s;ter's behaviour, to believe that he &s;ometimes acquainted Mr. Seldon with it.</P>
<P>I SHALL forbear to enumerate inci|dents, and only &s;elect a few, that are nece&s;&s;ary to explain, why I &s;o abruptly left Mr. Seldon.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that I frequented a &s;pouting-club. This &s;ociety was held at a reputable public hou&s;e, up one pair of &s;tairs. After I had, in compliance with the u&s;ual forms, paid for my ticket, and pa&s;&s;ed the bar, I &s;aw one of my compa|nions below, that prevented me from immediately going up: While he held me in conver&s;ation, I heard a voice, fa|miliar
<PB N="21" REF="38">
enough to me, enquire if Mr. Hilkirk was there; the landlady an&s;wer|ed in the affirmative; and, turning to look who the enquirer was, I &s;aw the back of Mr. Turnbull, pa&s;&s;ing quick out of the door. I was rather alarmed. I dreaded le&s;t Mr. Seldon &s;hould come to the knowledge of my tricks, and I &s;u&s;pected Turnbull. This fear, however, pre&s;ent|ly evaporated, and I joined the roarers above, who&s;e tragic &s;tarts, &s;ounding thro' the ceiling, operated &s;trongly on my ima|gination. It came to my turn to exhi|bit, and I cho&s;e that &s;cene in Macbeth, where the bloody dagger appears in the air. I was dre&s;t in a habit, made in imitation of Garrick's, with &s;haloon and tin&s;el.</P>
<P>Banquo and Fleance had made their exit, and I was proceeding, with infinite applau&s;e, through the &s;oliloquy: Ju&s;t as I came to that place, where the hero &s;ays
<PB N="22" REF="39">
to the &s;uppo&s;ed dagger, "I &s;ee thee &s;till," my a&s;toni&s;hed eye caught the terrible form of Mr. Seldon; the effect this had upon me was evident from the audi|ence; my knees knocked, my eyes were wild and rivetted, my voice faultered&mdash; I repeated,
<Q><L>I &s;ee thee &s;till,</L>
<L>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</L>
<L>Which was not &s;o before.</L></Q>
The picture of terror was &s;o perfect, that the room echoed with plaudits; but the &s;cene was quickly changed.&mdash;I endeavour|ed to proceed&mdash;"There's no &s;uch thing," &s;aid I, &s;taring at Mr. Seldon, <Q>It is the bloody bu&s;ine&s;s which informs thus to mine eyes.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You are mi&s;taken young man,</Q> an&s;wered he, with the grave&s;t face imaginable, "it is no vi&s;ion." This immediately turned the eyes of the whole a&s;&s;embly upon my ma&s;ter, in a moment their &s;erious prai&s;e was converted into the
<PB N="23" REF="40">
loude&s;t laughs, while Mr. Seldon, with the &s;ame gravity, commanded me to pull off that merry Andrew's jacket, and quit enacting of the monarch, in order to retire to my truckle bed, under the de&s;k.&mdash; At this &s;peech, the rafters once more trembled with the roar of laughter, which from the complexion of the gentry there gathered together, would doubtle&s;s have been augmented with catcalls, &s;houts, and hi&s;&s;es, had not the deportment of Mr. Seldon, which in &s;pite of impu|dence, commanded re&s;pect, in &s;ome de|gree over-awed their mirth.</P>
<P>MY &s;ituation was truly pitiable, I un|ca&s;ed, and my ma&s;ter, with a &s;low voice and bow, accompanied by the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous look of ridicule and &s;atire, wi&s;hed all the good company a very good night, while I &s;kulked after him, more aba&s;hed than Ther&s;ites by the &s;tern eye of Uly&s;&s;es.
<PB N="24" REF="41">
The next morning Mr. Seldon &s;poke to me to the following effect:&mdash;<Q>By my behaviour to you la&s;t night, young man, you may be convinced I have &s;ome regard for you, I engaged in a very aukward affair, incon&s;i&s;tent to my character, and di&s;agreeable to my inclination, purpo&s;ely to expo&s;e your ab&s;urdity in &s;o &s;trong a light, that you could not help feeling it. The&s;e &s;o|cieties, among which I under&s;tand you are become a leading man, have an idle, ridiculous, and vicious tendency, therefore, if you de&s;ire to gain my e&s;teem, let me hear no more of your kingly antics.</Q></P>
<P>AT the moment this coun&s;el was giv|en, I thought I would ob&s;erve it more religiou&s;ly than if it had been a mandate delivered by an angel: I have only in excu&s;e, the plea of the converted infidel,
<PB N="25" REF="42">
<Q>the fle&s;h was willing, but the &s;pirit was weak.</Q></P>
<P>MY love for Julia accelerated the ca|ta&s;trophe, and a match at billiards com|pleated it. I mu&s;t &s;peak of them in order.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious, at lea&s;t, to any but lovers, to relate the progre&s;s of love. Let it be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that our pa&s;|&s;ion was arrived to that &s;tage which pro|duced mutual declarations, and vows of everla&s;ting fidelity. Convinced, as I thought, of her di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and &s;in|cerity, enchanted by her beauty and the &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, my affection became violent. After the above explanation, my pur&s;uit of other plea&s;ures was, for &s;ome time, entirely abated: her &s;ociety was perfect happi|ne&s;s, her company and conver&s;ation, I
<PB N="26" REF="43">
believed to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to my exi&s;tence; but, alas, I have proved the po&s;&s;ibility of exi&s;ting without them. Repeated a&s;&s;everations of con&s;tancy, con|tinual opportunities of indulging in all the languor of delicate and exce&s;&s;ive love, which we did, as far as we could with innocence, and without di&s;|covering our pa&s;&s;ion, I had no dread of meeting oppo&s;ition from any but Mr. Seldon.</P>
<P>WE had been &s;o cautious, for &s;ome months after the avowal of our affection, that I had no rea&s;on to believe we were &s;u&s;pected: whether I was deceived in this, or whether we became le&s;s guarded, I know not; but by accident, I over-heard Mr. Seldon &s;aying &s;omething to Mr. Turnbull, to the following effect:&mdash;<Q>I'll &s;uffer it no longer; I am re&s;olved he
<PB N="27" REF="44">
&s;hall quit this family. His temper ir|regular, his pa&s;&s;ions untamed, he is no way calculated to make either her, or him&s;elf happy; he would be fond for a week, captious and overbearing with|in a month, and become completely mi&s;erable in a very &s;hort time; to &s;uffer him to marry with his pre&s;ent inexperience, ra&s;hne&s;s, and want of proper habits, were more unmerci|ful, than to ca&s;t him into the &s;ea.</Q>&mdash; I hardly knew whether to apply the above di&s;cour&s;e to my&s;elf, or not; it de|&s;cribed Mr. Seldon's friend&s;hip for me, in &s;o lively a manner, that I had &s;ome rea&s;on to hope it true on the one hand, while on the other, it cut me off from every pro&s;pect of felicity.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall I &s;ay to the conduct of Julia, who, of a &s;udden, and without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on, became di&s;tant and
<PB N="28" REF="45">
ceremonious, even to di&s;dain, as I ima|gined. In&s;tead of contrivances to throw her&s;elf in my way, which, I had before ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure, &s;he took every method to avoid me. If, by chance, I caught her alone, &s;he would break from me, and threaten to inform Mr. Seldon, if I per&s;i&s;ted in detaining her. This might be prudent, but I am certain it was perfidious. It agreed but ill with her former prote&s;tations.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould I torture my&s;elf to relate more of this tale than is nece&s;&s;ary? It upbraids me, it reminds me of my weak|ne&s;s. My pre&s;ent feelings convince me, I have not yet forgotten the traitre&s;s. I mu&s;t quit the &s;ubject for this time. I have rai&s;ed a train of images, that do not contribute to my tranquillity.

<HEAD>LETTER III. Mr. ALWYN, to Mr. STAMFORD, Junior.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your commands, I take the advantage of the fir&s;t po&s;t-day, to inform you of my &s;afe arrival at Kendal. To a mind perfectly at ea&s;e, the contra&s;t between We&s;tmoreland and London mu&s;t be very forcible. Not|with&s;tanding the little lei&s;ure I, who am under the influence of an unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion can find, I yet cannot entirely forbear, to ob&s;erve the &s;udden change of &s;cene. It &s;eems &s;carce an hour, &s;ince the noi&s;e of London, with her ten thou|&s;and carriages, rattled in my ears. I li&s;|ten, and find my&s;elf conveyed to the re|gion of &s;ilence. The face of the coun|try, likewi&s;e, is as different as the mo&s;t romantic imagination can &s;uppo&s;e. No beautiful green hedges inter&s;ecting the
<PB N="30" REF="47">
plain; no regular rows of &s;tately elms, or &s;preading oaks, meet the eye, but un|couth &s;tone-walls, va&s;t wilds, and prodi|gious mountains. Nature appears bleak and unadorned, but grand and capaci|ous. Here and there a &s;traggling pea|&s;ant is &s;een, with wooden &s;hoes and lank hair, uncon&s;cious of what we call grace and elegance, and cloathed only to de|fend him from the a&s;&s;aults of the &s;ea&s;on. Here, ever object is bleached, as it were, by time and &s;implicity: in Lon|don, a &s;atiri&s;t would add, every thing is &s;ullied by &s;moak, hypocri&s;y, and detrac|tion. Not that I &s;hould admire either the wit, or &s;entiment of the expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MEN are naturally much the &s;ame, and, con&s;idering the va&s;t number of them who inhabit that great city, I am often a&s;toni&s;hed at the order and tranquillity which are generally pre&s;erved. If the
<PB N="31" REF="48">
people here are hone&s;ter or happier, it is becau&s;e they have not &s;o many temp|tations. The glittering of equipage, the blaze of tapers, the inchantments of mu&s;ic, routs, balls, operas, gaudy co|lours, lewd women, decorated in all the emblazonments of art, folly, and fa&s;hi|on; &s;uch allurements tempt not, inflame not the imagination of the inhabitants of the wilds in We&s;tmoreland. A &s;mall a&s;&s;embly among the gentry and opulent trade&s;men, and the players for about &s;ix or eight weeks, con&s;titute their highe&s;t ideas of public luxury. Neither are tho&s;e wanting, who inveigh, with great warmth and acrimony, again&s;t the&s;e a|mu&s;ements, e&s;pecially the latter. This is not wonderful, when we recollect, that great part of the inhabitants of Kendal are Quakers. They have an excellent faculty of &s;taring at a &s;tranger; and I was que&s;tioned to-day, by &s;ome of
<PB N="32" REF="49">
the old dons, who are the only people here that think them&s;elves privileged to a&s;k impertinent que&s;tions, how &s;uch a good looking young man as I, as they were plea&s;ed to call me, could think of becoming a player.</P>
<P>MY landlord tells me, he doubts I am a wild young dog. His wife &s;ays, &s;he is afraid my poor mother has many an aching heart upon my account; for &s;he is &s;ure I am &s;ome good body's &s;on, who has had a world of trouble to bring me up. I told her that my mother is living; and &s;he became very impor|tunate for me to return home, and &s;ave her from breaking her heart. This con|ver&s;ation happened la&s;t night, and I a&s;|&s;ure you, I went to bed quite low-&s;pirit|ed, with her good old-fa&s;hioned exhor|tations. Indeed, I am &s;o well convinced of my dear mother's tenderne&s;s, that I
<PB N="33" REF="50">
am afraid her conjectures are too true. I begin almo&s;t to repent of my journey. I know no right I have, to mingle worm|wood in the bitter cup of old age. How|ever, I wrote into Oxford&s;hire by this po&s;t, and hope my fears are without foundation.</P>
<P>THERE are other rea&s;ons, why I am not the mo&s;t happy mortal in the world. Forgive me, dear Charles. You know my heart. I can conceal nothing from your friend&s;hip; I &s;hould be unworthy of it if I could. Your &s;i&s;ter's image lives in my bo&s;om. Oh Maria!&mdash;No change of time, of place, or object, can obliterate the memory of thy charms: on the barren mountain, in the fruitful valley, mu&s;ing on the gliding &s;tream, or &s;upine beneath the venerable oak, &s;till &s;hall thy welcome recollection call forth the painful, plea&s;ing &s;igh of melancholy;
<PB N="34" REF="51">
and cau&s;e to &s;teal, unbid, the tear of &s;or|row down my cheek.</P>
<P>PITY, but do not blame me. I know I have no preten&s;ions to &s;o amiable, &s;o beautiful an object; but who could live in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and behold her angelic form, hear her enchanting voice, ob&s;erve her benevolent, her &s;oul-winning acti|ons, and forbear to adore her? I am con&s;cious of my own unworthine&s;s. I know how much my kind patron has the happine&s;s of his cherubim, as he ju&s;tly calls her, at his heart. I have heard of his intentions: it has been &s;aid, there is one whom he wi&s;hes her to love. I am not to learn how dearly you, my friend, tender your father and &s;i&s;ter's tranquillity; and it were the utmo&s;t ba&s;ene&s;s in me, to attempt to render tho&s;e mi&s;erable, were it in my power, whom I have every
<PB N="35" REF="52">
rea&s;on to love and revere above all the world.</P>
<P>NO per&s;on but you, knows my real motive for retiring from my friends. My pa&s;&s;ion was in&s;upportable, and the peace of your family was concerned. It was painful to fly, but gratitude, friend&s;hip, and love demanded it. My pre&s;ent employment is unknown, and I would have it &s;o. My health began to decline, and that was a fair pretence for going into the country. My pre|dilection to the drama made this &s;cheme pre&s;ent it&s;elf as the mo&s;t pro|bable one of diverting my ideas from the channel in which they &s;o con&s;tantly flow; but, I am fearful, this, and every thing el&s;e, on this &s;ide the grave, will be ineffectual.</P>
<P>I KNOW you will excu&s;e the&s;e effu|&s;ions
<PB N="36" REF="53">
from a de&s;pairing lover, and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, whatever may be my fate, I will never give you cau&s;e to accu&s;e me of in&s;incerity.</P>
<P>I am, dear Sir, with the utmo&s;t re|&s;pect, the mo&s;t affectionate of tho&s;e who have the honour to call them&s;elves your friends.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. Mr. HILKIRK to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear ALWYN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM arrived at Taunton, and expect this will reach you at Kendal. I &s;hall continue the relation of my adven|tures without any apology. I mean to draw an ab&s;tract of my misfortunes, that after having compared them with your own, you may try whether it is not po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;trike a balance in my favour. The world will &s;ay I have de&s;erved my fate. I grant it.</P>
<P>GOADED by de&s;pair, &s;tung and di&s;|tracted by the continual recollection of Julia's perfidy, I became regardle&s;s of future con&s;equences. Neglecting you and every rational friend, who, I ima|gined, had come to a knowledge of cir|cum&s;tances that hurt my vanity, I
<PB N="38" REF="55">
&s;ought to drown my &s;orrows in di&s;&s;ipa|tion. Drinking was my aver&s;ion, and the gaming-table became my re&s;ource. My ideas of ju&s;tice and honour, tho' too firmly rooted to be ea&s;ily eradicated, could not entirely pre&s;erve me from the contagion that reigns in the&s;e horrid re|ceptacles of vice and infamy.&mdash;I found my&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly drawn into a familiarity with acknowledged ra&s;cals. Launched into a &s;ea of guilt, I was borne away by the tide; and, though I beheld my dan|ger, had not &s;trength to regain the &s;hore of virtue.</P>
<P>IT had been a cu&s;tom with Mr. Sel|don, from the time that I was &s;ixteen, to allow me a regular &s;tipend, with which I defrayed my own expences of cloaths and other nece&s;&s;aries; the &s;um was libe|ral, con&s;idering my &s;ituation, and had received an annual increa&s;e. He had ju&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="56">
paid me a quarter's allowance, out of which my extravagance had brought me under an obligation to di&s;charge a num|ber of debts, be&s;ides leaving &s;everal others unpaid. Con&s;cious of my weak|ne&s;s, as &s;oon as I received the money, I put ten guineas in my pocket, with a re|&s;olution to di&s;per&s;e them immediately among my creditors, without giving my&s;elf time to hear a billiard-ball, or lay a bett. As I was proceeding upon this virtuous errand, my evil genius threw a noted gambler in my way, known by the name of Long Jack, with whom I was acquainted. He enquired where I was going. I, to prove the &s;trength of my virtue, very candidly told him, that I was running with my ten guineas to pay my debts; and, as he was well ap|prized of my pa&s;&s;ion for play, a&s;ked him if he did not think me wi&s;e for &s;o doing: to which he replied in the affirmative,
<PB N="40" REF="57">
in &s;o po&s;itive a manner, that his appro|bation appeared perfectly &s;incere; a&s;king withal, how long it would be before he &s;aw me at Jack&s;on's, meaning the gam|ing-hou&s;e, to which I u&s;ually re&s;ort|ed. I told him, I &s;hould hardly be there that evening, for that my pre&s;ent bu|&s;ine&s;s would find me employment. Zounds, &s;aid he, that's unlucky, I have made a match for you with One-eyed Harry, the odd game in eleven for five pounds, to meet at eight. I have been to Connor's, and two or three tables to look for you; if you don't play, I forfeit a guinea to the blinking ra&s;cal. Why it is half pa&s;t &s;even now, an&s;wered I. Aye, &s;aid he, I know it, I lo&s;t nine pounds this morning with him; however, it is no matter, b&mdash;&s;t his odd eye, I'll have it out of him, one way or another.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;een too many of the tricks of
<PB N="41" REF="58">
the&s;e worthies, not to have my doubts con|cerning the reality of this pretended match; and putting on one of my pene|trating looks, I a&s;ked him if he was not deceiving me; but he confirmed the truth of his tale with &s;uch violent im|precations, cur&s;ing both &s;oul and body &s;o liberally, and con&s;igning them over to the devil &s;o entirely, if his guinea was not lo&s;t unle&s;s I played, that, aban|doned as I believed him, and all of them to be, I did not think it po&s;&s;ible for any wretch to have &s;o totally quitted all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame as to &s;wear &s;o horridly to a fal&s;hood. He ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, how much the match was in my favour; which, as he &s;tated it, was actually the ca&s;e; and that, though I might have a good opportunity of winning money upon my own play, yet, as it was entire|ly optional, I might &s;port or let it alone.</P>

Tho&s;e who have never fallen a &s;acrifice to this infernal di&s;ea&s;e cannot have an adequate idea of its malignancy; of the plea&s;ure that it promi&s;es, or the torture it in|flicts: and tho&s;e only who are acquaint|ed with its tyranny, know how to pity their fellow-&s;laves.</P>
<P>I PLAYED with various fortune till ten o'clock, when I found my&s;elf pennyle&s;s. Stung with my egregious folly, driven to madne&s;s at the remembrance of tho&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="60">
to whom I was indebted, I could not be contented, but would play on upon cre|dit. This, unfortunately for me, they willingly indulged me in, as I had ever paid debts of this kind with the utmo&s;t punctuality. Thus with my hand &s;haking, my mind di&s;tracted, my eyes dazzled and blinded by the di&s;order of my brain, did I engage to play at a game that requires a cool head, a keen eye, and a &s;teady hand, again&s;t men who knew how to take every advantage, and for &s;ums which I was con&s;cious of my inability to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>WHILE I was in the heat of play, and, as if in&s;pired by the daemons of the place, abjuring every title to heaven and mercy, imprecating cur&s;es on my &s;oul, and mi&s;ery on my body, Mr. Turn|bull came in. I was now arrived to that height of de&s;pair, which puts us beyond

a certain degree of fear; and the &s;ight of him, which at another time, in &s;uch a place, would have &s;truck a damp over me, was di&s;regarded. Some one who knew me, and had &s;een the manner of my proceeding, had kindly gone and informed Mr. Turnbull of it. He per|ceived my &s;ituation, and de&s;ired me to put on my coat and come home; to which I an&s;wered in a re&s;olute tone, that I would not; while the ra&s;cals that &s;urrounded me, &s;aid, with a deal of &s;eeming pity, that they had advi&s;ed the young gentleman to play no more, for they &s;aw he could not win; and that they thought, he had better be per|&s;uaded and leave off. This impudent lie heightened my madne&s;s to that de|gree, that I uttered a volley of cur&s;es which a&s;toni&s;hed Mr. Turnbull, and he immediately left the room; in which whi&s;pers, malicious grins of triumph, loll|ing
<PB N="45" REF="62">
of tongues, and winking of eyes, were exhibited with peculiar archne&s;s. I continued playing, &s;wearing, and lo|&s;ing for a few minutes, till I was inter|rupted by the return of Mr. Turnbull, accompanied by Mr. Seldon. Nothing could have added to the horrors I felt, but this. The mace dropt from my hand, the blood for&s;ook my cheeks, and with my mouth open and eyes &s;taring, I &s;tood for a moment &s;tupid, when &s;ud|denly a fit of phrenzy &s;eized me; I &s;natch|ed up the billiard-balls that lay before me, and, with one in one hand, and the other in the other, &s;truck my&s;elf violent|ly on each &s;ide of the head, and dropt motionle&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>IN this manner did the &s;cene &s;hut on me for that night. With my &s;en&s;es, I lo&s;t the remembrance of my di&s;grace, till the following morning; when I awoke,
<PB N="46" REF="63">
though to le&s;s wild, yet not le&s;s poignant griefs; and it was the greate&s;t care only, that could and did pre&s;erve me from a fever.</P>
<P>THE folly I had committed, the di&s;|grace I had incurred, the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever looking again on Mr. Seldon with confidence, added to the afflictions I endured from my unhappy love, made me re&s;olve to quit a family, where it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould enjoy a mo|ment's peace. Had not my own de&s;ire prompted me to this cour&s;e, I &s;hould &s;till have been obliged to have taken it. Mr. Seldon had avoided &s;eeing or &s;peak|ing to me &s;ince the &s;in of the billiards; it was with him a mortal one, and not to be forgiven. Accordingly, when I was out of danger from the little illne&s;s I had &s;uffered, he &s;ent Mr. Turnbull to me, who &s;poke to the following purport:
<PB N="47" REF="64">
&mdash;Mr. Seldon de&s;ires me to acquaint you, that it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould quit his hou&s;e; it is a duty that he owes both to his peace and reputation, to harbour no one who di&s;turbs the one, or &s;ullies the other; he has &s;ent you twenty gui|neas, with which he advi&s;es you to &s;eek your fortune, in &s;ome place where your character is not known; being certain, he &s;ays, that no man in his &s;en&s;es will harbour a gambler, to the endangering, perhaps, of not only his property, but his life: he likewi&s;e adds, that you mu&s;t expect no future favour from him of any kind whatever.</P>
<P>WHEN Turnbull had fini&s;hed, he laid the guineas, which I did not offer to receive, upon a table, and, with tears in his eyes, quitted the room. I was &s;ome time before I could recover my&s;elf enough to move from the place where
<PB N="48" REF="65">
I &s;tood; for though I had every rea&s;on to expect &s;omething of this kind, yet it did not de&s;troy the effect. At la&s;t I re|collected my&s;elf a little, and, taking pen and ink, wrote a long letter, di|rected to Mr. Seldon, and put it by the &s;ide of the money he had &s;ent me. This epi&s;tle contained an acknowledg|ment of my guilt, and an admiration of his lenity and goodne&s;s; many thanks for the favours I had &s;o often received, and &s;o ill de&s;erved; a refu&s;al of his la&s;t bounty, from the following motives&punc; fir&s;t, from a conviction of my unwor|thine&s;s; &s;econdly, from a re&s;olution that, &s;ince my own indi&s;cretion had plunged me into di&s;tre&s;s, I alone would be the &s;ufferer; a puni&s;hment that I would not forego; and, la&s;tly, that I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to incur any more obligations, becau&s;e it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould di&s;charge them.
<PB N="49" REF="66">
&mdash;I then collected &s;uch of my cloaths as were paid for, and, with my bundle in my hand, &s;hame on my countenance, and my heart ready to bur&s;t, went, or rather &s;lunk out of a hou&s;e, in which I once thought my&s;elf univer&s;ally be|loved.</P>
<P>WITHOUT money, without a friend, that &s;hame or pride would &s;uffer me to di&s;clo&s;e my di&s;tre&s;s to, or a habitation of any kind to hide my head in, I found my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of London &s;treets, for&s;aken and forlorn, an outca&s;t and alien among mankind. I had heard of people who&s;e employment it was to kid|nap and decoy others on board of &s;hips, that they might tran&s;port them to Ame|rica. Never did a wretched fearful cri|minal more earne&s;tly wi&s;h for a reprieve, than, at this moment, I longed to meet with one of tho&s;e friendly kidnappers.
<PB N="50" REF="67">
My mind, incoherent, &s;unk with grief and de&s;pondency, could think of no re&s;ource from ab&s;olute &s;tarving. At la&s;t, as I was wandering at the di&s;cretion of my feet, my eye accidentally glanced upon a printed bill again the wall. This was an invitation to all tho&s;e &s;pirited young fellows, who cho&s;e to make their fortunes as common &s;oldiers in the &s;er|vice of the Ea&s;t-India company. I be|held it with more joy than the Jews did the grapes brought from the land of promi&s;e, and was po&s;ting with all ha&s;te to enroll my name among that honour|able corps, when I was prevented by one Evans, whom I had known at the &s;pouting-clubs. He, &s;eeing my bundle and my rueful face, a&s;ked me where I was going; to which I replied, that had he a&s;ked me five minutes &s;ooner, I could not have informed him; but that, at pre&s;ent, I was for the wars. When I
<PB N="51" REF="68">
had explained my&s;elf he appeared greatly &s;urprized, and told me he thought he could put me upon a better &s;cheme than that, and one more &s;uitable to my in|clination likewi&s;e. He &s;aid, one Mac|loughlin, a famous London actor, was going over to play in Dublin; that he had been enquiring of him concerning a young fellow, &s;uch as me, and that, if I cho&s;e, he would introduce me to him; ob&s;erving, that it would be time enough to carry the knap&s;ack if the &s;ock did not &s;ucceed. This propo&s;al was too agreeable to be heard with inattention. Accordingly, having thanked my quon|dam acquaintance, and, after accept|ing his offer, related the deplorable &s;tate of my finances, at which he did not &s;eem at all &s;hocked or &s;urprized, I, at his entreaty, accompanied him to his lodging, which was at a piece-broker's, in White-hor&s;e-yard, Drury-lane, up
<PB N="52" REF="69">
three pair of &s;tairs backwards, with a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of gardens in two-penny pots, &s;moked tiles, and right ancient chimnies.</P>
<P>HAVING come to a mutual explana|tion, I found my friend Evans but little better &s;tocked with money than my&s;elf, the &s;um total being two-pence halfpenny; &s;o that, my watch and my &s;mall ward|robe con&s;idered, I was much the richer man. He told me we need not be in want of ca&s;h at pre&s;ent, for that lord North's office was always open to young gentlemen in di&s;tre&s;s, who carried a watch, or had a &s;uperfluous &s;hirt or &s;uit of cloaths. Lord North's office was a cant phra&s;e for a neighbouring pawn|broker's of that name, whither, with my con&s;ent, he conveyed &s;uch of my apparel as I had lea&s;t need of, to be bru&s;hed and laid by, as his joke had it,
<PB N="53" REF="70">
and in return brought me the &s;um of one guinea, which might be &s;omething le&s;s than a third of its worth, and which I divided with him. As for the watch it was a new one, that I had lately had upon credit, and which, as I knew it was now out of my power to pay for, I was determined to return. This ta&s;k I per|formed that very afternoon, in utter contradiction to the advice of Evans, who remarked with what elocution a gold tatler would plead its ma&s;ter's cau&s;e to the ears of the before-mentioned lord, and how carefully he always pre&s;erved &s;uch tokens of friend&s;hip, even to the conde&s;cending, &s;ometimes, to wear them in his own fob. I wrote likewi&s;e, for I had not effrontery enough to face them, to all my creditors, and of the &s;mall hopes there were of their being paid at pre&s;ent, but with a promi&s;e that no op|portunity &s;hould &s;lip, whenever I had it
<PB N="54" REF="71">
in my power; and this promi&s;e I have kept &s;o faithfully, that I am now out of the dread of duns.</P>
<P>THE next day, as was propo&s;ed, I was introduced to Mr. Macloughlin, by whom I found Evans was employed, as a kind of &s;cout, to pick up young&s;ters who had promi&s;ing geniu&s;es, it being one of this actor's pa&s;&s;ions to make ac|tors of others; though perhaps, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the wor&s;t qualified for it of any man in the world. He was &s;eated upon his couch, which &s;tood by the fire, and on which, when he found him&s;elf wea|ry or &s;leepy, he went to re&s;t, either by day or night, as it happened, and &s;ometimes did not go to bed for a fort|night together, according to the infor|mation of my conductor. As we went in we were followed by his wife, who brought him a ba&s;on of tea and &s;ome
<PB N="55" REF="72">
toa&s;t, with each of which he found fifty faults, in the rude&s;t manner. While I &s;taid he called to her &s;everal times, upon very frivolous occa&s;ions, at each of which &s;he was dignified by the name and title of Be&s;s. His countenance was to me, of all I had ever beheld, the mo&s;t for|bidding; and age, which had deprived him of his teeth, had not added to its &s;oftne&s;s. After having de&s;ired me to &s;it down, he eyed me pretty narrowly, and then a&s;ked me <HI>What had put it into my head to turn actor.</HI> The abruptne&s;s of the que&s;tion di&s;concerted me; and it was &s;ome time before I could an&s;wer, which I did in rather a confu&s;ed man|ner, at la&s;t, by &s;aying I had taken <HI>it into my head</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e it was genius, but that it was very po&s;&s;ible I might be mi&s;taken. Yes, &s;aid he, that's po&s;&s;ible enough; and, by G&mdash;d, Sir, you are not the fir&s;t that I have known &s;o mi&s;|taken.
<PB N="56" REF="73">
I &s;miled at his &s;atire, and he grinn|ed gha&s;tly with his leathern lips: a happy omen, for I perceived I had not added to the beauty of his vi&s;age, when I re|peated his words. While he was drink|ing his tea, we di&s;cour&s;ed upon indiffe|rent &s;ubjects, and as I did not happen to differ in opinion with him, but on the contrary, had opportunities of &s;ay|ing &s;everal things which corroborated his dogmas, he was plea&s;ed to allow I had the appearance of an ingenious young man. When his beverage was fini&s;hed, he de&s;ired me to &s;peak a &s;peech out of &s;ome play, which having per|formed, he remarked that he had never in his life heard a young &s;pouter &s;peak naturally, and therefore he was not &s;urpri&s;ed that I did not; however, as I &s;eemed tractable and docile, if I would call on the morrow, he would hear and an&s;wer me further.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="74">WHEN we had de&s;cended into the &s;treet, Evans &s;aid he was &s;ure it would do, for that I had met with a very kind reception; which indeed was the ca&s;e, it not being one of this per&s;on's foi|bles to over-&s;weeten his behaviour, or conver&s;ation, with the mild honey of the graces. As I look upon him to be a very extraordinary man, I &s;hall en|deavour to give you the outlines of his picture, and though, upon the whole, he behaved exceedingly ill to me, I will be careful that the drawing &s;hall not be out of nature.</P>
<P>THOUGH he was born in the la&s;t century, according to his own confe&s;|&s;ion, yet the faculties of his mind did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t impaired. He is &s;aid to have been bred in the interior parts of Ireland, and in &s;uch utter ig|norance that, we are told, from re&s;pect|able
<PB N="58" REF="75">
authority, of his not being able to read at the age of forty; the pro|gre&s;s, therefore, which he has made in language and literature, are a&s;toni&s;h|ing te&s;timonies of his genius and a&s;&s;i|duity. His body, like his mind, is ca&s;t in a mould as rough as it is durable. His a&s;pect and addre&s;s confound and confu&s;e his inferiors, and the delight he takes in making others fear and ad|mire him, gives him an aver&s;ion to the company of tho&s;e who&s;e know|ledge exceeds his own; nor did I ever hear him acknowledge &s;uperiority in any man. He has no re&s;pect to the timidity or pudency of youth or &s;ex, but will &s;ay the mo&s;t di&s;couraging, as well as the rude&s;t things, and receives plea&s;ure in proportion to the pain he communicates. It is common with him to a&s;k his pupils, why they did not rather think of becoming brick-layers
<PB N="59" REF="76">
labourers than actors. He is impatient of contradiction to an ex|treme, and when he finds fault, if the culprit attempts to an&s;wer, he &s;tops him without hearing him, with <Q>Ha, you have always a rea&s;on for being in the wrong.</Q> This impatience goes &s;till further, it often renders him abu|&s;ive. He can pronounce &s;coundrel, b&mdash;h, and ra&s;cal, with ea&s;e and famili|arity, and without the lea&s;t annoyance to his nervous &s;y&s;tem. He pretends to the &s;tricte&s;t degree of impartial ju&s;tice, and while his pa&s;&s;ions are unconcerned, pre&s;erves it; but the&s;e are &s;o exceed|ingly irritable, that the lea&s;t contradic|tion is an in&s;ufferable in&s;ult, and the want of capacity, or immediate com|prehen&s;ion in his pupils is, to him, &s;uf|ficient occa&s;ion to indulge his anger, which is often exceedingly rancorous, and has the direct tendency of inciting
<PB N="60" REF="77">
de&s;pair in&s;tead of emulation, e&s;pecially if the &s;cholar's feelings are quick and &s;en&s;ible. This is too &s;evere a climate for the tender plant of genius ever to thrive in. Though his judgment is &s;ound, and his in&s;tructions, in general, tho&s;e of a ma&s;ter, yet, he may be, and is, &s;ome|times wrong; but, if the learner &s;hould dare to think for him&s;elf, or offer the lea&s;t word in defence of a different opi|nion, it is high trea&s;on again&s;t this &s;tage monarch; and he is more &s;curri|lous and unmerciful than judge Jef|feries. In &s;hort, if I may e&s;timate the &s;en&s;ations of others by my own, tho&s;e de&s;pots, who, we are told, &s;hoot their attendants for their diver&s;ion, are not glanced at with more awe, nor much more honour than Mr. Macloughlin by his pupils and dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>AFTER having fini&s;hed our vi&s;it, we
<PB N="61" REF="78">
adjourned to the Black Lion, in Ru&s;&s;el-Street, whither many of the theatrical people re&s;ort. Here I learnt that Mr. Foote was going to take a company to Edinburgh, after the clo&s;e of his &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. Being anxious to &s;ecure my&s;elf an engagement, and the manner of Mr. Macloughlin having neither prejudiced me much in his favour, nor given me any certain token of &s;ucce&s;s, I re&s;olv|ed to make application to this other gentleman. Accordingly, after &s;ome &s;light excu&s;e to Evans, I po&s;ted away into Suffolk-Street.</P>
<P>I HAD the good fortune to find the wit at breakfa&s;t with a young fellow, who he had employed partly on the &s;tage, and partly as an amanuen&s;is. After being &s;hewn into the room, and de&s;ired to &s;it down, "Well," &s;aid he, <Q>young gen|tleman, I gue&s;s your bu&s;ine&s;s by the
<PB N="62" REF="79">
&s;heepi&s;hne&s;s of your manner; you have got the theatrical cacoethes, you have rubbed your &s;houlder again&s;t the &s;cene, hey? is it not &s;o?</Q>&mdash;I replied in the affirmative; <Q>Well, and what great he|ro &s;hould you wi&s;h to per&s;onate? Hamlet, or Richard, or Othello, or who?</Q> I an&s;wered I di&s;tru&s;ted my capability of performing any that he had mentioned; "Indeed!" &s;aid he, <Q>that's a wonderful &s;ign of grace. I have been teazed for the&s;e many years by all the &s;pouters in London, of which honourable fraternity I dare &s;ay you are a member; for, I can perceive no &s;tage varni&s;h, none of the true &s;trolling bra&s;s lacker on your face</Q>&mdash;"No indeed, Sir"&mdash;<Q>I thought &s;o. Well Sir, I never &s;aw a &s;pouter before that did not want to &s;urprize the town in Pierre, or Lothario, or &s;ome character that requires every

requi&s;ite and addre&s;s of a ma&s;ter in the art. But come, give us a touch of your quality; a &s;peech: here's a young&s;ter,</Q> pointing to his &s;ecretary, <Q>will roar Jaffier again&s;t Pierre, the loude&s;t take both.</Q> Accordingly he held the book, and at it we fell; the &s;cene we cho&s;e was the fir&s;t of the be|fore-mentioned gentlemen in Venice Pre&s;erved. For a little while at the beginning, I took the roaring hint he had thrown out, and re&s;trained my wrath, but it appeared &s;o in&s;ipid, and the ideas of rant and excellence were &s;o &s;trong|ly connected in my mind, that when Jaffier began to exalt his voice, I could no longer contain my indignation, but as Nic Bottom &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream.</NOTE> we roared &s;o, that it would have done your heart good to have heard us. Foote &s;miled, and af|ter enduring this vigorous attack upon
<PB N="64" REF="81">
his tympanum as long as he was able, interrupted us.</P>
<P>FAR from di&s;couraging me, he told me that, with re&s;pect to giving the mean|ing of the words, I &s;poke much more correct than he expected; but, &s;aid he, like other novices, you &s;eem to imagine all excellence lays in the lungs; whereas, &s;uch violent exertions &s;hould be u&s;ed but very &s;paringly, and upon extraordinary occa&s;ions; for be&s;ides that the&s;e two gen|tlemen, in&s;tead of &s;training their throats, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in common conver&s;a|tion, if an actor makes no re&s;erve of his powers, how is he to ri&s;e con&s;i&s;tent to the tone of the pa&s;&s;ion? He then read the &s;cene we had rehear&s;ed, and with &s;o much propriety and ea&s;e, as well as force, that I was &s;urprized, having al|ways &s;uppo&s;ed ri&s;ibility the only emo|tion he could in&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="82">AFTER this, he demanded if I could &s;ing, to which I an&s;wered in the affirma|tive, and, that I had likewi&s;e &s;ome knowledge of mu&s;ic; for you know it is a &s;cience that I, as well as you, al|ways took great delight in. When he had heard me chant, he prai&s;ed my voice, but told me, that, as I was entirely inex|perienced with re&s;pect to the &s;tage, if I was engaged with him, my &s;alary at fir&s;t would be very low. He &s;aid it was im|po&s;&s;ible to judge with certainty of &s;tage requi&s;ites, till they had been proved; and that, if after having con&s;idered of it, I judged it expedient to accept of one pound per week, I might come to him again a day or two before the theatre in the Hay-market &s;hut up; but that, if I could meet with a more flattering offer in the mean time, he begged this might be no ob&s;tacle; for that, as I might &s;up|po&s;e, it would be of no con&s;equence
<PB N="66" REF="83">
to him, and wi&s;hed me a good morn|ing.</P>
<P>I CAME away from this great wit, de|lighted with the ea&s;ine&s;s and frankne&s;s of his behaviour, and elated with my &s;uc|ce&s;s. However, as I had promi&s;ed Mac|loughlin to call, I did not think proper to fail. Accordingly, at this my &s;econd vi&s;it, he gave me a part to read in a piece which he him&s;elf was the au|thor of, and which had met with much &s;ucce&s;s. When I had fini&s;hed this ta&s;k, with which he appeared tolerably &s;atis|fied, he paid my under&s;tanding a great compliment, by reading &s;ome &s;cenes of a new comedy, which he was then writ|ing. Not that I can &s;uppo&s;e he expect|ed me to make any remarks that could a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but from that kind of weak|ne&s;s, to which the &s;tronge&s;t minds are in &s;ome degree &s;ubject, a de&s;ire of applau&s;e,
<PB N="67" REF="84">
and a hope that others will corroborate the va&s;t opinion we, at certain moments, entertain of our own capacity. This is in &s;ome degree laudable, at lea&s;t excu|&s;able; and, where genius is really con|cerned, mu&s;t become extravagant to merit our cen&s;ure. The &s;cenes that I heard were characteri&s;tic and &s;atirical, and met with my &s;incere and hearty ap|probation, which I &s;uppo&s;e did not a little contribute to prejudice Maclough|lin in my favour.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT my&s;elf bound in honour not to act with duplicity; I therefore told him of the offer I had had from Foote, giving at the &s;ame time my rea&s;on for &s;uch conduct, namely, the nece&s;&s;ity I was under of getting into &s;ome employment, or &s;tarving. He allowed the cogency of it, but &s;aid he thought I might do better in Ireland. He a&s;ked if I had any ob|jection
<PB N="68" REF="85">
to become a prompter, adding that it was profitable, and an office, from the good hand I wrote, and other cir|cum&s;tances, for which I might ea&s;ily be qualified. I an&s;wered he was the be&s;t judge of that, and that I had no other di&s;like to it, except that it would be more agreeable to my inclination to be an actor. This, he replied, might be indulged, and render me &s;o much the more u&s;eful. Little parts would be frequently wanting; the going on for the&s;e would accu&s;tom me to face the audience and tread the &s;tage, which would prepare me for better. I then demanded what &s;alary I &s;hould have an|nexed to this bu&s;ine&s;s; to which he an|&s;wered, that as I had my trade to learn, I could not expect &s;o much as a better workman; but that, &s;ince there was a deal of trouble in it, I could not have le&s;s than thirty &s;hillings, e&s;pecially as
<PB N="69" REF="86">

<HEAD>LETTER V. Mr. STAMFORD, Jun. to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS happy in receiving your favour, which, though not to be called a &s;hort one, I found deficient in many particulars&mdash;perhaps the impatience of my regard for you made me think &s;o. This is finding fault, you'll &s;ay, and in truth I find my&s;elf a little di&s;po&s;ed to blame you, for giving no account of the heroes and demi-gods into who&s;e &s;o|ciety you are, I pre&s;ume, by this time admitted. Your offer of corre&s;pon|dence I accept with much plea&s;ure, but give you warning, that I &s;hall expect a very minute account of all your tran&s;|actions, which cannot fail of being im|portant; and, on the other hand, as I
<PB N="71" REF="88">
am not &s;o &s;ituated as to expect a &s;eries of adventures, you mu&s;t allow me to fini&s;h <HI>&s;ans ceremonie,</HI> when I have no|thing to communicate. I &s;hould be very much inclined to laugh at your plan of operations, if the circum&s;tances that engage my notice were of le&s;s con|&s;equence to your happine&s;s. We have all been very dull &s;ince your departure. My father is frequently ob&s;erving, that he mi&s;&s;es his favourite Harry, and never mentions your name without &s;ome epi|thet expre&s;&s;ive of his love or good opi|nion. Maria, poor girl, feels, I fear, too powerfully the effects of love. You often &s;aid, when I remarked the tender|ne&s;s of my &s;i&s;ter's behaviour to you, that it proceeded only from the &s;weet|ne&s;s of her temper, and the benevolence of her di&s;po&s;ition, and not from my real partiality in your favour. That mo|de&s;ty which makes you blind to your
<PB N="72" REF="89">
own merit, occa&s;ioned your &s;aying &s;o; but I always thought otherwi&s;e, and your ab&s;ence confirms me in that opi|nion. Her chearfulne&s;s is fled, &s;he often complains &s;he is not well, and takes every opportunity of &s;tealing from company. Her harp&s;ichord is her only amu&s;ement, where &s;he is continually &s;inging that plaintive little &s;ong you wrote, and which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, &s;he &s;et. I have often ob&s;erved the tear &s;tarting from her eye at the la&s;t &s;tanza, which &s;he &s;ings with the mo&s;t pathetic expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eeming to breathe forth her &s;oul in the melody. This &s;he often apologizes for, with a forced &s;mile. <Q>I know bro|ther,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>you think me very fooli&s;h for being &s;o affected with feigned &s;orrows, but I cannot help it.</Q> I always tell her I love her for it, for tears of compa&s;&s;ion are nature's
<PB N="73" REF="90">
marks of di&s;tinction, and the heart that never melts is le&s;s than human. When|ever your name is mentioned, her bo|&s;om heaves with a &s;igh, that &s;he in vain endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s; and when I told my father I had heard from you, &s;he could &s;carcely conceal her emotions.</P>
<P>SHE begged I would let you know, that &s;he mi&s;&s;es your company and a&s;&s;i&s;tance at her &s;tudies, and hoped you would recover your health, &s;o as to en|able you to return to town next winter. Be&s;ides, &s;aid &s;he, you may tell him I am quite at a lo&s;s for a beau. As for a beau, replied my father, I take it you will &s;oon be provided with one with|out waiting for our Harry; for Mr. Maitland acquaints me, that his &s;on Tom is coming up to town next week, and who knows what may happen be|tween this and Chri&s;tmas. The la&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="91">
&s;entence was &s;poke in a kind of arch manner, that &s;hewed his vi&s;it was in con&s;equence of a previous agreement between old Maitland and him. Maria under&s;tood it &s;o, and, making a half bow of acknowledgment, &s;at very grave and &s;ilent during the re&s;t of the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;ed at dinner, and in the even|ing, when the bu&s;ine&s;s in the counting-hou&s;e was &s;ettled, my father &s;ent for me into his &s;tudy, where I found him &s;itting with a letter in his hand.</P>
<P>"CHARLES," &s;aid he, <Q>I have, for &s;ome time, been con&s;idering about &s;ettling you and your &s;i&s;ter in life, as it would be the highe&s;t &s;atisfac|tion to me to &s;ee my children re|&s;pectably &s;ituated before I die.

I &s;hall not, now, enlarge on the profe&s;|&s;ion, nor remind you in how many ways it will be in your power to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport individuals, as well as your country, without injuring your|&s;elf; but am, at pre&s;ent, to acquaint you that I have determined to ad|mit

you into partner&s;hip with me, and that the articles are now ready for executing.</Q> I was going to an&s;wer when he proceeded thus; <Q>I &s;hall continue in the hou&s;e, if I live, four years; at the expiration of which term I &s;hall quit the bu&s;ine&s;s in your favour, and retire to fini&s;h my days at my hou&s;e in Kent. As for Maria,</Q> continued he, "this letter contains a propo&s;al which I think much to her advantage. It is from <Q>my old friend Maitland, and I have an&s;wered it by to-night's po&s;t, in|forming him, that I intend to give her fifteen thou&s;and pounds; be&s;ides which, &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a little e&s;tate of about 200l. a year, left her by her aunt Conan; but that &s;he will have no more till after my decea&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Mr. HILKIRK to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your's from Kendal, by which I am informed of your &s;afe arrival. I am glad that the relation of my adventures has afforded you plea|&s;ure and, in compliance with your re|que&s;t, &s;hall here &s;end you the remain|der. It is a happine&s;s to me to be able to gratify or oblige my friend at &s;o cheap a rate.</P>
<P>IT was not long before every thing was &s;ettled in the manner propo&s;ed by Mr. Macloughlin, and I was inform|ed it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;et off for Dublin, it being the intention of the proprietors to open the theatre about the beginning of October. In con&s;e|quence
<PB N="83" REF="100">
of my de&s;ire to appear in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">cter he had promi&s;ed, not only to procure me &s;uch an opportunity, but, likewi&s;e, to in&s;truct and become my pa|tron; and, upon my repre&s;enting to him my want of ca&s;h for the journey, he lent me &s;ix guineas on the part of the managers, and gave me a letter to Mr. O'Neal, who would, out of re&s;pect to him, provide me with a lodging and do me other &s;ervices of the like nature which could not but be agreeable to a young&s;ter like me.</P>
<P>I REWARDED my friend Evans with a guinea, redeemed my cloaths with an|other, and left London, elated with the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects. Could I have forgot the name of Julia and the family of Seldon I &s;hould, at this moment, have been a &s;tranger to &s;orrow: but that was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="101">ABOUT the latter end of September I arrived in Dublin. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;cene, and the va&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the oeconomy and manners of the people, made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon my ima|gination. The bar at the mouth of the Liffy renders the entrance up that river pa&s;&s;able but to &s;hips of &s;mall burthen, and to them only when the tide &s;erves. It was low water when we came to the mouth of it, and a boat came along &s;ide of our ve&s;&s;el, into which mo&s;t of the cab|bin and &s;teerage pa&s;&s;engers went, rather than wait another tide, and I among the re&s;t. The river divides the city, and there were about a dozen who were &s;et on &s;hore on the quay; but I, as per let|ter, enquired for Capel-&s;treet, which was on the contrary &s;ide. Thither, accord|ingly, I was carried, and my trunk and my&s;elf landed in a beer-hou&s;e. I was a&s;toni&s;hed when the water-ruffians, with
<PB N="85" REF="102">
their red beards, black hair, and wild eyes, dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d five and five-pence, to|gether with a qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of three-penny, for my carriage from the packet; the more &s;o, as I had &s;een the other pa&s;&s;engers give but a &s;hilling each, and one or two of the meaner among them only &s;ix-pence. I remon&s;trated at the impo|&s;ition, and quoted the precedent of the &s;hilling; to which one of the&s;e mode&s;t gentry replied, in the true Connaught ac|cent, <Q><HI>F'why,</HI> now blood and ouns, &s;ure we can &s;ee now that you are a &s;weet honey of an Engli&s;h young <HI>Jontle|man;</HI> and &s;ure, <HI>agrah,</HI> I always de|light to &s;ee an Engli&s;h <HI>Jontleman &s;it</HI> his foot on board my boat. Long life to 'em; they don't come like Spalpeens, <HI>wid</HI> a &s;ix-pence halfpenny in their hand, &s;ure <HI>f'why,</HI> to a poor man. And &s;o as you are a &s;tranger, <HI>f'why,</HI> we brought you to this beer-hou&s;e,
<PB N="86" REF="103">
<HI>beca&s;e</HI> as <HI>f'why,</HI> the <HI>divel</HI> &s;o hone&s;t a <HI>fillow</HI> is there in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole city of Dublin as my landlord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere.</Q>&mdash;&mdash; To this harangue the landlord, who pre|tended to be in my intere&s;t, replied, that <Q>to be &s;ure, there was not two hone&s;ter <HI>fillows brathing</HI> than Pat M'Cullogh and Brian O'Flanaghan; but <HI>howiver,</HI> the <HI>divel</HI> burn you Bri|an,</Q> added he, <Q>you &s;ee the <HI>Jontle|man</HI> is a &s;tranger, and &s;o you mu&s;t take no more than four and four-pence; which, Sir, is ju&s;t four Eng|li&s;h &s;hillings, and the pot of three-penny.</Q></P>
<P>THE wildne&s;s of their looks, the &s;moothne&s;s of their tongues, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they had taken of my trunk, upon which one of them &s;eated him&s;elf, while the other argued the ca&s;e, occa|&s;ioned me to comply with their de|mands;
<PB N="87" REF="104">
but that which was the greate&s;t cau&s;e of admiration to me in the whole &s;cene was, that the landlord, who &s;wore by the holy Father to their hone&s;ty, while I was paying them, no &s;ooner &s;aw their backs turned, than, according to his own phra&s;eology, <Q>he pitched them to the <HI>divel,</HI> for a couple of cut-throat, <HI>chating</HI> ra&s;cals, that <HI>de&s;arved</HI> hanging wor&s;e than a murderer.</Q></P>
<P>I AM &s;orry to &s;ay that, during my &s;hort &s;tay in Ireland, I had but too many occa&s;ions to ob&s;erve a &s;hocking depravity of morals, which I attribute, either to the laws, or the want of a due en|forcement of them. The Iri&s;h are habi|tually, not naturally, licentious. They have all that warmth and genero&s;ity which are the characteri&s;tics of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions; and, when properly edu|cated, are an honour to mankind. Hi|bernia
<PB N="88" REF="105">
has produced many fir&s;t-rate ge|niu&s;es, and, in my opinion, nothing but the foregoing circum&s;tance has pre|vented her from producing many more. It is the legi&s;lature that forms the man|ners of a nation.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;et out from London, I was a&s;&s;ured that the hou&s;e would open at the beginning of October, but it was November before the &s;ea&s;on commen|ced; &s;o that my finances were once again exhau&s;ted, and I was obliged to apply, on the credit of Macloughlin, to Mr. O'Neal, for a farther &s;upply. Our acting manager was one O'Dogherty, alias Daw&s;on, a bu&s;y, bu&s;tling fellow, that pretended to carry the world be|fore him. Void of principle, an ene|my to truth, except when it &s;erved his purpo&s;e better than fal&s;hood; inured to flattery from the poor wretches whom
<PB N="89" REF="106">
he employed as &s;ervants about the hou&s;e, and whom it was his cu&s;tom to kick with the utmo&s;t familiarity, whenever he found him&s;elf &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, I pre|&s;ently di&s;covered there was an in&s;ur|mountable antipathy between his di&s;|po&s;ition and mine. But the means of my exi&s;tence were at &s;take; I endea|voured, therefore, to accommodate my|&s;elf as much to his temper as po&s;&s;ible, and waited for the arrival of Maclough|lin with the utmo&s;t impatience. I un|der&s;tood my engagement to have been permanently fixed at thirty &s;hillings a week; but, when I went to the trea&s;ury, I found it reduced to a guinea; and whenever I pleaded my agreement, re|ceived the mo&s;t mortifying and in&s;ult|ing an&s;wers. I perceived the utter im|probability of my becoming a favourite. None were &s;o but &s;uch as could ad|mini&s;ter the mo&s;t gro&s;s flattery, and who
<PB N="90" REF="107">
li&s;tened to whatever was &s;aid in the theatre concerning this demagogue and his management, and repeated the gleanings of their indu&s;try in his pri|vate ear.&mdash;I vainly &s;uppo&s;ed the pre&s;ence of Macloughlin would put an end to all my grievances; I looked up to him as my patron, as one who had been the occa&s;ion of my leaving England, who had pledged him&s;elf to be my friend, and was bound to protect me. Whe|ther O'Dogherty had prejudiced him again&s;t me, or whether he ob&s;erved my deficiency at adulation, I cannot deter|mine, but I found him very cold in my intere&s;t, and far more di&s;po&s;ed to brow-beat than countenance me. He had promi&s;ed to teach me a part, and bring me out in it; and when I ventured to remind him of it, I received only &s;arca&s;tic remarks on my inability. I per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting the po&s;itivene&s;s of
<PB N="91" REF="108">
my agreement re&s;pecting my &s;alary, con|cerning which Macloughlin had the meanne&s;s to equivocate; but I could only obtain an addition of four &s;hillings per week. In&s;tead of directing, or a&s;|&s;i&s;ting me in my bu&s;ine&s;s as a promp|ter, which he had engaged to do before I con&s;ented to undertake it, he took every opportunity of venting his ten|fold portion of &s;pleen upon me.</P>
<P>INCAPABLE of extricating my&s;elf, I endured the mean in&s;ults of ignorance and malice for five months, till the money which I had borrowed had been deducted from my &s;tipend, and then O'Dogherty immediately di&s;charged me. It would be no ea&s;y matter to de&s;cribe what I felt at this moment. I had not five &s;hillings in the world, was in a &s;trange kingdom, and had no means, now that I was &s;hut out from the thea|tre,
<PB N="92" REF="109">
of obtaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I be|held nothing but mi&s;ery and famine, and imprecated cur&s;es on Macloughlin, for the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct to|ward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me. Of this I was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that, though the &s;everity of his manner had gained an entire a&s;cendency over me, I went to his hou&s;e, and with the utmo&s;t firmne&s;s, after premi&s;ing that I would rather &s;tarve than incur a fre&s;h obligation from <HI>him,</HI> di&s;played the im|propriety and inju&s;tice with which he had treated, and the &s;hocking nece&s;&s;ity to which he had reduced me in &s;uch animated terms, that all his accu&s;tom|ed &s;ternne&s;s fled, and the Cynic &s;tood aba&s;hed before the boy.</P>
<P>THE money which had been deduct|ed from my &s;alary to di&s;charge my debt was &s;o con&s;iderable that I had not been able to pay my lodging. I had
<PB N="93" REF="110">
a bill again&s;t me there, of between three and four pounds. It is true, there was another theatre open in Smock-al|ley, under the direction of Mo&s;&s;op; but he was in&s;olvent, and none of his people were paid. Here, however, as to a dernier re&s;ort did I apply, and was engaged at the &s;ame nominal &s;alary that I had had at Capel-&s;treet.</P>
<P>A FEW days after this event I was told, by an acquaintance, that a &s;tranger had been making enquiries after me in a very circum&s;tantial and particular manner; and that he appeared much affected when he heard how I had been treated by O'Dog|herty and Macloughlin. The de&s;crip|tion of this &s;tranger's per&s;on an&s;wered ex|actly to that of Mr. Turnbull. I re|ceived this intelligence at the theatre; and, when I returned home, I found a letter directed to me, and a ten pound
<PB N="94" REF="111">
bank bill enclo&s;ed. The contents inform|ed me that the donor was an old friend who had a &s;incere regard for me; and who, if I per&s;evered in my di&s;tre&s;s to pre&s;erve my principles, did not doubt of &s;eeing me, on &s;ome future day, as much fa|voured of fortune as I was, at pre&s;ent, per&s;ecuted by her. The <HI>character</HI> of this epi&s;tle, though purpo&s;ely di&s;gui&s;|ed, confirmed me in the opinion that Turnbull was the old friend alluded to.</P>
<P>THIS event called up a train of ideas of the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned kind. My former companions, my patron's care, con&s;picuous in its &s;everity, the friend|ship of Turnbull, which now appeared even romantic, for I could not place his journey to the account of bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Seldon having no connexions in Dublin, added to the fond remembrance of Julia, and contra&s;ted with the for|lorn
<PB N="95" REF="112">
condition in which I then beheld my&s;elf, gave me the mo&s;t poignant &s;en&s;e of the alteration. At one mo|ment, all po&s;&s;ibility of future happine&s;s vani&s;hed; and at the next, a gleam of hope beamed in the prophecy which the letter contained. This, while it left a kind of riddle in my imagina|tion, which I yet cannot tell how to &s;olve, fortified me in my former re&s;o|lutions of pre&s;erving my integrity.</P>
<P>IT &s;oon appeared that there was no probability of being paid for my per|formance at Mo&s;&s;op's theatre; I therefore very willingly quitted Dublin in March, and went on board the packet for Park-gate, re&s;olving that, if I mu&s;t be mi|&s;erable, England &s;hould be the &s;cene of my &s;ufferings. The wind was fair till we had lo&s;t &s;ight of the hill of Hoath; but pre&s;ently, after &s;un-&s;et, a
<PB N="96" REF="113">
hurricane came on, which, in this narrow and rocky &s;ea put our lives in imminent danger. Of this, however, the violence of the &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s made me in&s;en&s;ible. We were drove, during the &s;torm, con|&s;iderably to the north, and &s;uch was the ignorance of the ma&s;ter and his two or three &s;uperannuated mariners, that he continued &s;ailing northward, having no knowledge of navigation, but what he had gained by coa&s;ting between the two kingdoms. This, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, was of no u&s;e to him; &s;o that, in all likelihood, we &s;hould have made the tour of Greenland, had not an in|telligent Scotchman, among the pa&s;&s;en|gers, known &s;ome of the headlands in his own country. The blockhead of a ma&s;ter would have conte&s;ted the point, and proceeded to the land of bears, had not the company perceived his &s;tupi|dity and joined the North Briton, who,
<PB N="97" REF="114">
with a degree of warmth expre&s;&s;ive of his attachment to his bleak hills, called out, <Q>What the de'el mon, d'ye think I dinna ken the craig of El&s;ey.</Q></P>
<P>THIS extraordinary voyage kept us eight days without putting into any port, except &s;ending the boat on &s;hore on the evening of the &s;eventh, at the I&s;le of Man, to procure &s;ome provi&s;ions for the pa&s;&s;engers, who were almo&s;t &s;tarved, having devoured the &s;tock which is u&s;ually provided for the&s;e kind of voyages in a day or two after the &s;torm had abated. The rea&s;on why we were &s;o very long in making our port was, the extraordinary calm that had &s;ucceed|ed; which the mariners, who are the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious of all human beings, attributed to there being &s;ome Jonas on board. This opinion they had in|culcated among the poor devils who
<PB N="98" REF="115">
pay half a crown for their pa&s;&s;age in the hold; who were as ignorant as them|&s;elves, and far more mi&s;chievous. Un|happily for me, I was the per&s;on on whom their &s;u&s;picions alighted the &s;tronge&s;t. They had di&s;covered me to be a player, a profe&s;&s;ion con&s;igned over, by the almo&s;t univer&s;al con&s;ent of man|kind, to the devil. For what rea&s;on I could never yet di&s;cover. This ridicu|lous belief, however, had nearly co&s;t me my life. The wild Iri&s;h in the hold were chiefly catholics, and the &s;ixth day from our departure happened to be Ea&s;ter Sunday. I had &s;auntered off the quarter-deck, with a volume of Hudibras in my hand, and walked to the other end of the ve&s;&s;el, when I found my&s;elf encircled by two or three fel|lows with mo&s;t ferocious countenances, who were &s;taring at me with looks ex|pre&s;&s;ive of loathing and revenge. Mo&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="116">
of the pa&s;&s;engers were at breakfa&s;t, and nobody upon deck but the&s;e ragamuf|fins, and a couple of the mariners, who joined them. The particularity of their manner attracted my notice, and one of them a&s;ked me, with his lips qui|vering with pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>If I had not bet|ter be getting a prayer-book, than be radeing plays upon that bli&s;&s;ed day.</Q>&mdash;I perceived the fellows were inebriated, and, like a ra&s;h fool, in|&s;tead of &s;oothing, a&s;ked them if they imagined there was as much harm in <HI>radeing</HI> a play as in getting drunk, and &s;o early in the morning too. <Q>By the holy fadther,</Q> replied the &s;poke&s;man, <Q>I know you. You are the Jonas, and by Ja&s;us the &s;hip will niver &s;ee land till you are to&s;&s;ed over-board, you and your plays along wid you; and &s;ure it will be a grate dale better that &s;uch a wicked wretch as you
<PB N="100" REF="117">
&s;hould go to the bottom, than that all the poor innocent &s;owls in the &s;hip &s;hould be lo&s;t.</Q> This &s;peech entire|ly di&s;concerted me. The re&s;olute tone of the ra&s;cal, and the approbation which his companions di&s;covered were alarm|ing. I pre&s;erved fortitude &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure them, it was not a play-book that I was reading, and opened it to convince them, while I edged away to|wards the quarter-deck, which I gained almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner that a cat keeps curs at bay till &s;he &s;teals into her hole.</P>
<P>I FEAR I tire you with the&s;e tedious accounts of my&s;elf: you &s;ay not; be it as it will, I have taken the liberty of a friend; and as you appear depre&s;&s;ed with the peculiarity of your &s;ituation, my intention is only that you may compare notes, and &s;ee whether you
<PB N="101" REF="118">
have hitherto been equally unfortunate. I have little more to relate that is worth your hearing. I arrived at Che&s;ter, and re&s;olved to write to &s;uch travelling com|panies as I could procure any intelli|gence of. My knowledge of mu&s;ic, my talents as a &s;inger, and my recent arrival from Dublin, were recommen|dations that en&s;ured me &s;everal engage|ments. I cho&s;e one in a company that was then at Leeds in York&s;hire. In this my ill &s;tars were again predo|minant. I found them in a &s;tate of anarchy, de&s;pi&s;ed by the town, and quarrelling with one another, their ma|nager calling them all ra&s;cals, and they returning the compliment. Here I di&s;|covered, too, how nece&s;&s;ary practice is to the player; and that, though &s;ome of them could &s;carce read, they could all &s;peak on the &s;tage better than I could.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="119">IN le&s;s than three weeks the greater part of the people &s;eparated, and, no others coming to &s;upply their places, the company no longer exi&s;ted. A let|ter had followed me from Che&s;ter, in|viting me to join another &s;ett, then at Hereford; but it had been wrote near a month, it was a hundred and &s;ixty miles acro&s;s the country, and I did not know, if I &s;et out, whether I &s;hould find them there; or if I did, whether they might then &s;tand in need of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But my ten pound bill was, by this time, notwith&s;tanding all my oeconomy, reduced to eleven &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence. With a heavy heart then, and a light pur&s;e, did I begin another journey; and on the fifth day of my peregrination, entered an inn by the road-&s;ide, which was eight and twen|ty miles from Hereford, with the &s;um of nine-pence in my pocket, and made
<PB N="103" REF="120">
my exit in the morning pennyle&s;s. The fatigue of my journey, and the penurious manner in which I had lived, had &s;o re|duced my &s;pirits, that I found great diffi|culty in performing this la&s;t day's ta&s;k upon an empty &s;tomach; but there was no remedy. About four o'clock I a&s;cended the hill that looks down upon this an|cient city, at &s;ight of which, a thou&s;and anxieties took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my bo&s;om. The players might be gone, and I, un|known to every living creature, had a &s;pirit incapable of confe&s;&s;ing the &s;tarv|ing condition to which I was reduced. I enquired of the fir&s;t man I met, with an emotion that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe, if the comedians had left Here|ford; and leave you to imagine what I felt, when he an&s;wered in the nega|tive. Faint, weary, and ready to drop with hunger, I traver&s;ed the town to enquire for the manager; but it was one
<PB N="104" REF="121">
of the nights on which they did not perform, and he was not to be found. I was directed to his brother, who was a barber in the city; and upon their ob|&s;erving my weakne&s;s, and de&s;iring to know if I was not well, I collected courage enough to tell them that I was greatly fatigued, having come a long journey, and for the la&s;t day not hav|ing broke my fa&s;t, except at the brook. I know not what kind of &s;tuff &s;ome peoples hearts are made of, but I know that, notwith&s;tanding this confe&s;&s;ion, in the making of which I had done great violence to my feelings, they heard it without offering me any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or even &s;o much as te&s;tifying either &s;ur|prize or pity, and I quitted the hou&s;e with the tears in my eyes.</P>
<P>WHEN the players under&s;tood a fre&s;h member was come to join them,
<PB N="105" REF="122">
they, from &s;ympathy, &s;oon di&s;covered my di&s;ea&s;e; and when I gave them the anecdote of the barber, con&s;igned him over to the devil, in a mo&s;t emphatical manner. Little, except common occur|rences, has happened to me &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>I STAID with this company &s;ome time, till a difference with the manager occa&s;ioned me to leave it. I have &s;ince been only with Santlo, and the one to which I have lately removed. The &s;malle&s;t trifles that any way affect the fortunes of a friend, I believe, are heard with plea&s;ure, or anxiety; and though I do not, by any means, think my&s;elf either the <HI>only,</HI> or the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> unfortunate per&s;on in the world, I have offered the&s;e anecdotes of my life, both to amu&s;e and convince you, that in appearance, at lea&s;t, you have been far more happy

than I. There is another motive, you know how delighted I am with your corre&s;pondence. Though you are not in arrear with re&s;pect to tale, you are certainly deficient in weight; I therefore hope you will communicate with the utmo&s;t freedom, whatever futurity &s;hall produce, and if you are not already wearied, I &s;hall continue to trifle as oc|ca&s;ion may offer.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. Mi&s;s STAMFORD, to Mi&s;s GOWLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear JULIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW long &s;hall I wi&s;h, in vain, for the plea&s;ure of your company? Your la&s;t letter gave me rea&s;on to hope for it a fortnight ago. I have ever &s;ince been in expectation of &s;eeing you, and long to communicate the &s;ecrets of my bo&s;om. Oh, my Julia, I am very wretched. I have lo&s;t my former chear|fulne&s;s, and can think of nothing but my misfortunes.</P>
<P>I KNOW your tender and compa&s;|&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition will &s;ympathize with me in deploring the effects of a pa&s;&s;ion that has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my un|guarded heart. Alas, I knew not it
<PB N="108" REF="125">
was love! Under the &s;pecious di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip I have deceived my&s;elf, and &s;imply thought it in my power to limit my inclinations to e&s;teem and re|gard. Fatal experience has &s;hewn the contrary. I &s;igh for a happine&s;s that every hour removes farther from me.</P>
<P>I WILL now tell you all, and, if I am tedious, you will excu&s;e it. It is &s;ome relief to communicate my &s;orrows by letter, &s;ince your company is denied me.</P>
<P>WHEN my father was young, he was frequently employed on the Continent, in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s on account of my grandfather. On one of the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions he went on board a &s;hip, up the Straits, in which one captain Alwyn was a pa&s;&s;enger for Gibraltar, where his company then was. They became
<PB N="109" REF="126">
very intimate, and their friend&s;hip was confirmed by an accident, that happen|ed during the voyage.</P>
<P>IT was at that time war with France, and the &s;ailors &s;pied a &s;hip, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be a French man of war. My father went up the rope-ladders to look at it, and unfortunately &s;lipped into the &s;ea, where he mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed, if Alwyn had not in&s;tantly jump|ed after, and &s;u&s;tained him by &s;wimming, till a boat could be &s;ent to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. I have often heard my father mention, with regret, that he never &s;aw him &s;ince they parted at Gibraltar, he being &s;lain in battle, a few years af|terwards.</P>
<P>LONG after this, calling on Me&s;&s;rs. Brown and Co. army-agents, he there &s;aw a lady of the name of Alwyn; and
<PB N="110" REF="127">
curio&s;ity prompting him to make &s;ome enquiries, he found &s;he was the widow of his friend. She had with her an only &s;on, whom &s;he had brought to town from &s;chool, to place in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; and my father, happy in an opportunity of &s;hewing his attachment, as well as gratifying his own benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, begged &s;he would leave to him the care of providing for her Harry, for &s;o he was called. He was in con&s;e|quence received into the counting-hou&s;e, where, till lately, he has ever &s;ince re|mained.</P>
<P>I WAS then at &s;chool, where I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many happy hours with my dear Mi&s;s Gowland. Hours of peace|ful enjoyment that never will return! I had few opportunities of cultivating Mr. Alwyn's acquaintance till I entirely quitted Mrs. Carrington's, when I found
<PB N="111" REF="128">
him &s;urpri&s;ingly grown, and adorned with every quality that di&s;tingui&s;hes the man of merit.</P>
<P>HIS education had been of the fir&s;t &s;tamp, to which he had added that po|li&s;h which the finer accompli&s;hments are &s;ure to be&s;tow, where the under&s;tanding is good. His temper and addre&s;s were the mo&s;t plea&s;ing in the world; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the obligations he owed my father, &s;eemed to &s;hew it&s;elf in all his actions. I do not know whether that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s made him diffident, but I thought &s;o; and, as well to &s;e|cond my father's good intentions as to &s;hew my own &s;en&s;e of his merit, I gave him every mark of e&s;teem and friend|&s;hip in my power.</P>
<P>HE was made principal clerk about that time, for which rea&s;on his atten|dance
<PB N="112" REF="129">
was not &s;o immediately required in the counting-hou&s;e. My brother and he were therefore always together, and very often would accompany me on the harp&s;ichord. Mr. Alwyn had a turn for poetry, which now and then appeared in a &s;ong; the&s;e were always &s;et by my mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, and formed a principal part of our entertainment. I have &s;eve|ral by me, which I will &s;hew you when we meet.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e means we &s;oon became on the mo&s;t intimate terms of friend&s;hip; and it was with great concern I ob&s;erved his health decline for the&s;e &s;ix months pa&s;t. I did not &s;u&s;pect his love till he pre&s;ented me with the following &s;ong, which was &s;o applicable to him&s;elf, that it could not e&s;cape my ob&s;ervation.</P>

<P>I MUST confe&s;s the di&s;covery gave me plea&s;ure; but I thought it be&s;t to make no alteration in my conduct to|wards him. Little did I then think my regard for him was capable of occa&s;ion|ing
<PB N="114" REF="131">
&s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in my bo&s;om. But his farewel, when he went into the country for the recovery of his health, was attended with a look, in which de|&s;pair and re&s;ignation were &s;o blended, that I was quite melted, and was obliged to retire to conceal my tears.</P>
<P>ALAS! exclaimed I, it is true that I love him, and that he is unhappy! Per|haps his fatal pa&s;&s;ion may prove the bane of all his hopes. Perhaps the &s;truggle between love and gratitude, in a mind &s;o truly &s;u&s;ceptible of every noble feel|ing, may overcome him, and he may pine under the hated load of life.

<P><PB N="115" REF="132">OPPRESSED with thoughts like the&s;e, and convinced by ab&s;ence how much I love him, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to conceal the alteration in my di&s;po&s;ition. I con|tinue whole days in my chamber, and avoid company, under pretence of ill|ne&s;s. My brother, I believe, &s;u&s;pects the real cau&s;e; for he found me the other morning in tears at my harp&s;ichord, &s;inging the little &s;ong I have &s;ent you.

is very far from being the per&s;on I would pa&s;s my life with. I do not believe it po&s;&s;ible for him to be &s;erious.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Mr. STAMFORD, Jun. to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you la&s;t week, in an&s;wer to your's; but have not &s;ince had the plea&s;ure of a line from you. Old Maitland's &s;ending my father a propo|&s;al of marriage, in the form of a ma|thematical problem, is truly whim&s;ical. What is &s;till more, my father a&s;&s;ures me that there is no joke at all meant by it; but, that he &s;eriou&s;ly intends to make him&s;elf under&s;tood. If he intend|ed quite the contrary, I think he could not have adopted a better method.</P>
<P>YOUNG Maitland is arrived, <HI>to try the experiment,</HI> as his father expre&s;&s;es it; but Maria does not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="118" REF="135">
exert her <HI>attractive influence.</HI> She is con&s;tantly wrapt in thought, and takes very little notice of him, and he does not appear to care much about it. He is one of tho&s;e wild youths, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding, have too much vivacity to u&s;e them. I am afraid Maria, who is all meekne&s;s and delicacy, will be very unhappy with him if the match &s;ucceeds, and I &s;ee nothing at pre&s;ent, to hinder it, for &s;he will never di&s;pute her father's will; and young Maitland &s;eems as if he thought it no affair of his, but leaves it to the management and direction of the old folks.</P>
<P>I HAVE agreed to accompany him to Maitland-hall, in a fortnight, where I promi&s;e my&s;elf a va&s;t fund of enter|tainment from the oddities of his father. We &s;hould have &s;et out &s;ooner, but
<PB N="119" REF="136">
that it would be impolite to leave Mi&s;s Gowland, who is now on a vi&s;it to my &s;i&s;ter. You have often heard Maria mention her. They were at Mrs. Car|rington's boarding-&s;chool together, and contracted a friend&s;hip, which is found|ed in the mo&s;t perfect union of di&s;po|&s;ition and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>MISS Gowland is rather above the middle &s;tature, but perfectly well-&s;haped and genteel. She cannot be called hand|&s;ome; but the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of her countenance, is &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of every amiable trait of di&s;po&s;ition, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to behold her without e&s;teem. I think &s;he differs from Maria, in a kind of volatility that I cannot de&s;cribe bet|ter, than by comparing her to the Al|legro, and Maria to the Pen&s;ero&s;o of Milton. Each for the time claims the preference.</P>
<Q><PB N="120" REF="137">Nec diver&s;a tamen: qualem decet e&s;&s;e &s;ororum.</Q>
<P>BUT Maria's hopele&s;s love may tend, at pre&s;ent, to heighten the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FOR me, I &s;till continue heart-whole. The de&s;tinies have not yet made a lover of me. The only concern that en|gro&s;&s;es my attention, is the fate of my dear friend, and poor Maria. I know &s;he will never love Maitland, and in any ca&s;e but the pre&s;ent, I am &s;ure my father would not oppo&s;e her inclination. I never &s;aw him &s;o bent on any affair, as on this; and though old Maitland's letter had a great deal of frigidity in it, it is only owing to his ridiculous at|tempt to bring every thing to the te&s;t of mathematical demon&s;tration; for, they have both intended the match for &s;ome years. The nature of their at|tachment you will judge from the fol|lowing narration. I had it from my
<PB N="121" REF="138">
father, one evening, as we were con|ver&s;ing on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BEING both in the &s;ame cla&s;s at &s;chool, the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they afforded each other in their &s;tu|dies was the fir&s;t ground of particular intimacy. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of nearly the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, and equally unacquainted with the world, they &s;pent their early youth among the heroes of anti|quity, and incited each other to emu|late their virtues. But they were chief|ly enamoured with tho&s;e plea&s;ing de|&s;criptions of retirement and &s;olitude with which the poets abound, and from them formed the idea of a kind of life that &s;eldom exi&s;ts but in the imagination. In&s;tead of wi&s;hing to cut a figure in the world, their de&s;ires were fixed on &s;ome peaceful retreat, where their em|ployment might be to tend their flocks,
<PB N="122" REF="139">
and repo&s;e on the verdant banks of a rivulet,
<Q>Far from the bu&s;y world, and all its cares.</Q></P>
<P>THESE ideas were &s;till more enforced by the rural &s;ituation of the &s;chool, which gave them an opportunity of forming grottoes, and other poetical edifices; and there was &s;carce a grove or &s;tream in the neighbourhood that did not, at one time or other, afford them a &s;ubject for an ode.</P>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing two years in this &s;weet delu&s;ion, my father began to awake, and con&s;ider him&s;elf as an inhabitant of this world; but it was not &s;o with Maitland. He had, indeed, di&s;covered, that the Heathen mythology was a fic|tion; for his ma&s;ter had not &s;en&s;e to put him into the rational way of &s;tudy|ing it. It was therefore no longer the

<P>MY father, who came to town from &s;chool nearly at the &s;ame time as Mait|land, was immediately placed at the de&s;k in my grandfather's counting-hou&s;e; and, by attention and a&s;&s;iduity, rendered him&s;elf &s;o u&s;eful, that, &s;ome years before his death, he gave him a half &s;hare of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

Two &s;hips from the Mediterranean, that he had underwrote for a va&s;t amount, were taken; and he, not being able immediately to an&s;wer the demand, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking up a con|&s;iderable

<P>THINK what a &s;ituation my father was then in. Mourning for the death of a dearly loved parent, yet obliged to apply all his attention to prevent the overthrow of a bu&s;ine&s;s, which, though lucrative, he knew to be then in&s;olvent. What could he do? He applied to Mait|land; for their friend&s;hip, which as it had not remained uncultivated during this long interval, did not require ceremony. Maitland came immediately to town, elated with the opportunity of &s;erving him, though he &s;ympathized in his lo&s;&s;es; and not only advanced the &s;um, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in other re&s;pects &s;o con|&s;iderably, that it may almo&s;t be &s;aid

<P>SOON after this tran&s;action my father married, and received ten thou&s;and pounds in ca&s;h with my mother, be|&s;ides the manor in Kent, to which &s;he was heire&s;s.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE, and po&s;&s;ibly you may too by this time, that old Maitland, from a very ab&s;tracted mode of thinking, forms conclu&s;ions and adopts maxims which he never takes the trouble to compare with per&s;ons and things about him. Whence it is, that they are fre|quently inadequate, and always &s;in|gular.</P>

<P>BUT I wander from the point. He has but one child, this youth is ju&s;t come from college; and, by what I can collect, Maria was intended for him from her birth.

<P>I WISH I could make you &s;en&s;ible how forcibly I feel your generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip. Your let|ter expre&s;&s;es an opinion of me which I fear I am not worthy of; yet, &s;uch is the human heart, it attaches me &s;o pow|erfully to you, that I believe, there is nothing &s;o romantic, which I would not undertake to prove my gratitude.</P>
<P>YOUR account of Maria made my heart overflow. I hope you are mi&s;taken in the cau&s;e of&mdash;What do I &s;ay?&mdash;Is that my wi&s;h? Is there any thing on earth could give me &s;o much delight as to be beloved by her?&mdash;Would it

<P>WE have not yet began to play, our theatre will not be ready before Friday. We are to open with Romeo and Juliet; and I, for my fir&s;t appearance, am to be the hero of the night. A good men|tal phy&s;ician would not, I believe, have pre&s;cribed &s;o &s;weet a do&s;e; the &s;tudying

My feelings are &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e put into the mouth of the young Montague that it mu&s;t be &s;trange if I mi&s;take my part. The com|pany have formed great expectations of me, I am told, from hearing me re|hear&s;e; and the manager, who is a bu&s;y talkative per&s;on, is puffing his perform|ers among the town's-people, and me among the re&s;t. As I &s;hall, perhaps, endeavour to amu&s;e you now and then with the adventures of the theatre, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to inform you of the police and oeconomy of the &s;ociety of which I am a temporary member: that is, as far as I my&s;elf have learned.</P>

Their code of laws, from the little reading I have had upon the &s;ubject, &s;eems to have exi&s;ted, with few material variations, at, or per|haps, before the days of Shake&s;peare, who is, with great rea&s;on <Q>the god of their idolatry.</Q> The per&s;on who is rich enough to furni&s;h a wardrobe and &s;cenes, commences manager, and has his privileges and re&s;trictions.

That is not the ca&s;e with them, they being all in debt to the manager, and, of cour&s;e, chained to his galley; which he does not fail to inform them of, when they are refractory.

What the devil I &s;hall do without my teeth I don't know; for to mend the matter I lo&s;t my old ones, that I made &s;hift with in common, on the road, and I can't &s;peak a word with|out li&s;ping, wor&s;e than if I had belonged to the tribe of Ephraim; and was ordered to &s;ay &s;hibboleth at the pa&s;s of Jordan, by the cruel ba&s;tard of Gilead.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this fine rhetori|cal flouri&s;h, I am devili&s;hly deceived if I don't &s;ee through this genero&s;ity. Men don't give their money away &s;o freely without &s;ome view.

Now there are two things you expect, one, that I &s;hall reform in a hurry, and the other that I &s;hall give you a &s;ketch of the queer creatures I have been &s;hut up with for this fortnight, but you are confoundedly mi&s;taken, if you think I'll take the pains to do either the one or
<PB N="151" REF="168">
the other. I have not been out later than ten &s;ince my arrival in town, and was &s;o lo&s;t for want of a frolick, that I was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of having one on the road. I wi&s;h you had been there, for I had it all to my&s;elf,&mdash;but you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>YOUNG Stamford and I left London on Tue&s;day morning, attended by our &s;ervants on hor&s;eback. My man Sam, of who&s;e dexterity and addre&s;s you have &s;een proofs before now, was with me, and we arrived at M&mdash; in the evening, ju&s;t as the pa&s;&s;engers were alighting from the &s;tage-coach. I &s;tood at the inn-door while they were unpacking their carca&s;es from the clo&s;e &s;towage of the vehicle, and fancied, from their ap|pearance, that they were a &s;ett of charac|ters that might afford &s;ome diver&s;ion. In con&s;equence of this &s;uppo&s;ition, I
<PB N="152" REF="169">
propo&s;ed to Stamford to &s;up with the pa&s;&s;engers, which was agreed to. Sam went to reconnoitre the inn, and I ap|plied my&s;elf to learn the di&s;po&s;itions of our fellow-travellers.</P>
<P>THE company was compounded of a &s;hort fat man about forty, with a cut of countenance not very inviting, for, ar|rogance and &s;elf-conceit were painted in every line of it. His wig was of the con&s;truction that cu&s;tom, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, has rendered one of the attributes of holine&s;s, and a blue grey &s;uit of cloaths, of a mo&s;t &s;tiff and formal outline, put it out of doubt, that he was a &s;on of mo|ther church. I afterwards found he was a country &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who had been to London to procure &s;cholars, whom he found in all requi&s;ites for ten pounds a year. Oppo&s;ite him &s;at a figure, who&s;e calling and occupation were not &s;o much
<PB N="153" REF="170">
within the reach of conjecture. Deceit &s;eemed to be the very e&s;&s;ence of his com|po&s;ition. I never &s;aw a man that &s;o immediately in&s;pired me with aver&s;ion. His a&s;pect was like that of a mi&s;chievous animal that &s;urveys you with fear, but with a fear mixed with an intention of hurting you, as &s;oon as off your guard. His hair was lank and grey, his per&s;on tall and aukward, and his vi&s;age pale, hollow, and illuminated with a pair of &s;mall, &s;unken eyes that might have given ri&s;e to the fictions of witchery and incanta|tions performed by an evil &s;ight. A &s;ett of habiliments, put together in a very pe|culiar &s;tyle, would have tempted me to pronounce him an apothecary of the la&s;t century, if a pair of dirty bands had not indicated that his province was that of a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> man-midwife. He profe&s;&s;ed to believe the new birth, and was him&s;elf a living proof of his doctrine;
<PB N="154" REF="171">
for, without a metaphor, it was nece&s;&s;ary for a man to be born again to <HI>become like</HI> him.</P>
<P>NEAR him &s;at a couple of females, who &s;eemed to be mother and daughter. The mother, I &s;oon di&s;covered to be a di&s;ciple of the re&s;pectable pa&s;tor I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, but the daughter, a fre&s;h girl about &s;ixteen, did not &s;eem to have much of the devotee about her.</P>
<P>THE remaining pa&s;&s;enger was a young fellow in regimentals, who was &s;tanding by a window, with his back to the com|pany, when I entered. He came up to me, and, after common compliments, we entered into conver&s;ation without regarding the others, of who&s;e &s;ocial powers I had already entertained a very contemptible opinion. He acquainted me that he was an en&s;ign in the 40th
<PB N="155" REF="172">
regiment, was going to head a re|cruiting party at Bri&s;tol, and at the &s;ame time gave me a &s;ketch of the cha|racters of his companions, as I have ju&s;t now hinted.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;upper was brought in the Methodi&s;t ro&s;e up, and, inclining him&s;elf forward, not in the graceful attitude of an orator, but, rather, in that of a per&s;on labouring under the operation of an emetic, treated us with a grace of a quarter of an hour's duration. The &s;chool-ma&s;ter appeared &s;omewhat cha|grined, whether on account of the u&s;urpation of his office as chaplain, or the <HI>venter famelicus qui aures non habet,</HI> or both, I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay; but I ob&s;erved, during the cour&s;e of the even|ing, that he and the Methodi&s;t were ir|reconcileable enemies to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="173">AFTER &s;upper, and the circulation of a gla&s;s or two, he aro&s;e to put in prac|tice the &s;ame manoeuvre, but was op|po&s;ed by the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who objected to it as, not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but, phari|&s;aical. This produced a warm alter|cation, in which the Methodi&s;t had ma|nife&s;tly the advantage; for, being well read in &s;cripture, he undertook, with great calmne&s;s, to prove, that the &s;chool-ma&s;ter was a limb of the whore of Ba|bylon: whereat the other was &s;o enraged that he lo&s;t all power of utterance, and &s;tood ga&s;ping like a cat in an air-pump.</P>
<P>WE joined the Methodi&s;t, (who pro|ceeded in his quotations without re|garding the mighty rage of his antago|ni&s;t,) and by that means put him into &s;o good a humour, that at the reque&s;t of the old lady, he con&s;ented to give us
<PB N="157" REF="174">
an exhortation. For which, and its con|&s;equences, you mu&s;t wait till next po&s;t, for at pre&s;ent I'm quite tired.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Mr. MAITLAND, Jun. to STAFFORD OSBORNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear OSBORNE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you, la&s;t po&s;t, an account of my arrival here, and promi&s;ed to let you know the &s;equel of my road adventures, which, without further pre|amble, I here continue:</P>
<P>THE Methodi&s;t had planted him&s;elf on his knees, in a great arm chair, and was raving on in his exhortation, while I was cur&s;ing my &s;tupid brains that had not yet hinted any propable &s;cheme of diver&s;ion, though with &s;uch admi|rable &s;ubjects to practi&s;e on. "Who," &s;aid he, <Q>was St. Paul? Did he ride in a coach? No. Was he a bi&s;hop? No. Did he preach in a great church? No, No, No. It was in the fields,
<PB N="159" REF="176">
my brethren. He ca&s;t out devils, and healed the &s;ick. I once knew a poor woman, at Bri&s;tol&mdash;a very poor woman,&mdash;but rich in faith,&mdash;and &s;he had experiences,&mdash;and was in a good way,&mdash;and &s;he &s;ought after us that teach the true way,&mdash;and the devil came,&mdash;and &s;he &s;aw him,&mdash;and he ap|peared unto her,&mdash;&mdash;even the roaring lion, and he roared,&mdash;and &s;he ran out of the hou&s;e, and came to me,&mdash;and &s;he wept bitterly,&mdash;and I &s;aid unto the devil</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>AT this in&s;tant, Sam and Stam|ford's &s;ervant, each with an extingui&s;her put out the candles, and the devil &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed to the view of the affrighted preacher. He did not &s;top to recognize his Bri&s;tol acquaintance, but, over|&s;etting the chair, made his e&s;cape up the chimney. The ladies &s;creamed horribly, and the officer drew his &s;word,
<PB N="160" REF="177">
and made a pa&s;s at Mon&s;. le Diable, but, finding it had no effect, exclaimed, "Lord have mercy on my poor &s;oul!" threw down his &s;word, and, in endea|vouring to remove him&s;elf farther from the object of terror, over&s;et the table, with the bottles and gla&s;&s;es that were on it. Stamford and I were not a little &s;tart|led at the pre&s;ence of &s;o unexpected a vi&s;itant; though we &s;oon di&s;covered it to be the effect of a magic lanthorn, which, it afterwards appeared, Sam had borrowed of a Jew, who was then in the tap-room of the inn.</P>
<P>DIRECTED by the rays of light, I perceived the in&s;trument &s;tanding on the chimney-piece, which was the oc|ca&s;ion of this phaenomenon, and re|moved it time enough to prevent a di&s;|covery. The &s;ervants immediately came in with lights, and, with &s;ome difficulty, got the Methodi&s;t down the chimney.
<PB N="161" REF="178">
Our &s;chool-ma&s;ter, having left the room previous to the exhortation, e&s;caped his part of the fright, but the &s;hare he had in an adventure which followed left him no great cau&s;e for boa&s;ting.</P>
<P>WORDS cannot de&s;cribe the figure the poor devil of a Methodi&s;t cut, when extracted from his &s;ooty hiding-place. The natural hollowne&s;s of his vi&s;age was augmented by certain lights and &s;hades, acquired during his re&s;idence in the chimney, and a gha&s;tly and idiot &s;tare the remaining fright had left on his countenance. He looked round the room with a &s;ort of timid caution, that demon&s;trated how unwelcome a return of the apparition would be, and it was long before he could recollect any of his fellow-travellers. The ladies bore it very well, all things con&s;idered, and the officer was particularly &s;erious on the
<PB N="162" REF="179">
occa&s;ion; while Stamford looked at me with enquiring eyes, and I gave Sam credit for the whole contrivance.</P>
<P>'TWAS in vain to think of &s;itting down again, as a company, and, there|fore, I called Sam to &s;hew me the bed|rooms, which were on the &s;ame floor, opening every one into a long gallery that faced the court-yard.</P>
<P>THE &s;uite of rooms con&s;i&s;ted of four, in each of which were two beds. The old lady and her daughter took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of one, Stamford and I another, and the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, entering a third, was followed by the Methodi&s;t, who&s;e fears of another vi&s;it from the prince of darkne&s;s had impelled him to make &s;ure of a companion. The officer, of cour&s;e, had the remaining chamber to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="180">WHEN Stamford and I were alone we interrogated Sam about the trick he had played on the apo&s;tle, and received intelligence that another plot was in agitation, to prevent their over-&s;leeping them&s;elves. Stamford objected to it, as cruel, and thought it might po&s;&s;ibly hurt their under&s;tandings; but I over|ruled it, and, about midnight, he began his operations.</P>
<P>THEN it was that the clattering noi&s;e of &s;ome quadrupede animal was heard in the gallery, which &s;eemed to &s;hake with the burthen. Our preacher di&s;|covered, by an ejaculation or two, that his afflictions had kept him waking; but his companion manife&s;ted no other &s;igns of life than a profound na&s;al trumpeting, which, at a di&s;tance, might have been mi&s;taken for a couple of &s;aw|yers at work.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="181">THE Methodi&s;t was not long in &s;u&s;|pence, for the &s;ound of hoofs approach|ed his chamber, the door of which flew open and admitted the cau&s;e of his apprehen&s;ions, who addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words, <Q>O thou &s;inful wretch, deceiver of the &s;imple, calumniator of the good, and liar to the community, thy time is accompli&s;hed, and I, thy evil genius, am come to convey thee to the gloomy man&s;ions of de&s;pair. I appear unto thee in the &s;hape of an a&s;s, becau&s;e thou art an a&s;s, and com|mand thee to ari&s;e, and mount on my back, which if thou delaye&s;t to perform, I will tear thee in&s;tantly to pieces.</Q> At this threat I heard the frighted wretch get out of bed, &s;ighing and groaning, and, the in&s;tant after, roaring with all his might. The apparition, on who&s;e back he had mount|ed, began to bray, and i&s;&s;ued out of the
<PB N="165" REF="182">
room with great impetuo&s;ity, nor &s;top|ped till they arrived at the &s;tairs-head, whence down they both tumbled together.</P>
<P>ALARMED at this circum&s;tance, Stam|ford and I hurried after them, and found the preacher lying on the ground, alone, in his &s;hirt. Lifting him up, we perceived he had &s;u&s;tained no other in|jury than a few brui&s;es, and the fright, which had made him almo&s;t &s;tupid. We conveyed him to bed, in the room where the officer had been, and ordered a &s;ervant to &s;tay with him, while we went to enquire into the particulars of the adventure, from the &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE knight of the ferula was covered over head and ears in bed, where he had lain during the whole confu&s;ion, not having had courage to ri&s;e. A violent per|&s;piration had wetted the bed-cloaths almo&s;t through, and, on his peeping
<PB N="166" REF="183">
forth, our no&s;es were informed that &s;olids, as well as fluids, had e&s;caped him, in his fright. He was &s;o much cheared, at our appearance, that he found utterance for his &s;urpri&s;e, which thus broke forth, and mingled with the potent effluvia:</P>
<P><Q>OH, gentlemen! little did I think, when I left my native country and ventured up to London, that I &s;hould have joined in the &s;ociety of the children of darkne&s;s. That fanatical wretch, who with the&s;e eyes, I &s;aw riding to hell on the back of a fiery jack-a&s;s, has given me &s;uch a &s;hock, as, I fear, I &s;hall never recover. Alas! even now I perceive my inte&s;tines are relaxed, and the contents of the vi&s;cera are here and there di&s;per&s;ed in the bed. I am become as lank and flaccid as a half blown bladder. My nervous &s;y&s;tem is de&s;troyed, and I que&s;tion if my members will ever
<PB N="167" REF="184">
regain their proper tone. Lend your kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that I may ri&s;e and get &s;ome refre&s;hment. Nature abhors a vacuum, and my poor bowels ap|proach but too near to that &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>WE could not refu&s;e our help; but, on rai&s;ing him up, the fumes of the ege&s;ta, here and there di&s;per&s;ed, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, became &s;o powerful, that we let him down again, and covered him up, advi&s;ing him to wait till we &s;ent a &s;ervant, with linen and other re|qui&s;ites, to enable him to appear as be|came a man of his con&s;equence.</P>
<P>GOING down into the hall, we found every body in the inn dre&s;&s;ed, and in full conver&s;ation on the event that had di&s;turbed their repo&s;e. Various were the conjectures formed on the occa&s;ion, for, the parties concerned being ab&s;ent, no authentic intelligence could be gained.
<PB N="168" REF="185">
This continued till the arrival of the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who entered, tolerably clean&s;ed, and immediately fortified him|&s;elf with a bumper of brandy. After which he proceeded to tell us that, being in his fir&s;t &s;leep, he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by a dreadful voice that exclaimed, <Q>I am thy evil genius!</Q> on which he im|mediately &s;tarted up, and, drawing his curtain, perceived the room was filled with a blue, &s;ulphureous flame, in the mid&s;t of which appeared a &s;pectre, larger than an elephant, with fiery horns, but in the &s;hape of a jack-a&s;s. That the Methodi&s;t got out of bed, howling and weeping, and mounted on the back of the hobgoblin, which after diver&s;e fri&s;ks and nefarious gambols, roaring in the mean time mo&s;t dreadfully, on a &s;udden vani&s;hed in a fla&s;h of lightning. In con&s;equence of which, and the intoler|able &s;tench of brim&s;tone, he, the narra|tor,
<PB N="169" REF="186">
was compelled to evacuate the whole quantity of aliment then in his body; which &s;hot forth, neither more nor le&s;s, than as if exploded from a wind-gun. That moreover, he lay in a trance, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om that in&s;tant, till the coming of the two gentlemen into the room, and concluded with a&s;&s;uring the company, that he had no doubt but that horrid wretch, the Me|thodi&s;t, was now receiving the reward of his mi&s;deeds.</P>
<P>IN the morning I vi&s;ited our Anti-Mahomet, who had almo&s;t rode to hell, in&s;tead of heaven, on an a&s;s; and, to my great &s;urprize, found him &s;itting by a table, with a leathern ink-horn in his hand and writing. After enquiring about his health, and expre&s;&s;ing my ad|miration at the extraordinary occur|rences of the la&s;t twelve hours, I beg|ged he would, if po&s;&s;ible, explain the cau&s;e of tho&s;e appearances.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="187">"Last night," &s;aid he, <Q>after the vi&s;itation of the Evil One, I &s;at on my bed, ruminating, with inward an|gui&s;h and manifold groanings of the &s;pirit, on my back&s;lidings. It is written, 'Re&s;i&s;t the devil, and he will flee from you.' In&s;tead whereof, I retired with &s;ome ha&s;te, and gave place to the adver&s;ary. Oh, wretch|ed man, for this cau&s;e it was permit|ted unto him to &s;courge thee, even with whips of &s;corpions. While I thus wre&s;tled with the corruptions of my heart, lo, it thundered, the bed trembled beneath me, and one of the angels of perdition &s;tood in my &s;ight. He had one eye that glittered like the moon, his no&s;trils re&s;embled a glowing oven, and from his po&s;teriors came forth fla&s;hes of lightening. At fir&s;t I was frighten|ed, which the devil perceiving, &s;natch|ed
<PB N="171" REF="188">
me up in his claws, and carried me through the air with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s: but I &s;oon recollected my&s;elf, and compelled him, by the force of my adjurations, not only to &s;et me down, but al&s;o to di&s;clo&s;e ma|ny &s;ecrets of the invi&s;ible world, which I intend to publi&s;h under the title of 'News from Tophet;' being a relation of the extraordinary deal|ings of the &s;pirit with John Wi&s;ely, and al&s;o of &s;undry buffetings of Satan, &s;u&s;tained by him in his mini&s;try. Ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be read as a warning in the&s;e later days of iniquity. Recom|mended by the Reverend Mr. Filcher. Sir Rueland Howl will give it a good word in one of his &s;ermons, and, without doubt, it will be purcha&s;ed in great numbers by the children of grace at the door of the tabernacle. Whence it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that
<PB N="172" REF="189">
the truth will prevail mightily, and great gain &s;hall ari&s;e therefrom. More|over, it would cau&s;e me to rejoice in &s;pirit, to behold your name in the li&s;t of my &s;ub&s;cribers.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH this narration was a ma&s;ter|piece of lies and hypocri&s;y, and though I knew his publication would be a &s;hame|ful impo&s;ition on the credulous multi|tude, yet I could not forbear noticing his la&s;t reque&s;t, by &s;lipping a couple of guineas into his hand. This unexpect|ed benevolence &s;urprized him &s;o much, that he was at a lo&s;s to expre&s;s his ac|knowledgments. He a&s;&s;ured me, that his heart leaped within him at the pro|&s;pect of my approaching conver&s;ion; and that I might depend upon it, that this money was the be&s;t I had ever laid out in my life, as it had purcha&s;ed me the rever&s;ion of a &s;eat among the cele&s;|tials.
<PB N="173" REF="190">
I thanked him for the cheap bargain he had let me have, and left him to the compilation of his pamphlet.</P>
<P>SOON after which we mounted our hor&s;es, and arrived at Maitland-hall by the evening.</P>
<P>THE whole of the afore&s;aid dreadful adventure con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than Sam's driving an a&s;s into the preacher's room, behind which he &s;tood, and, in a feigned voice, uttered the threats that obliged him to mount the crea|ture, which carried him down &s;tairs out of its own mere motion and private judgment. The thunder was the nine|pin bowl trundled acro&s;s the room, and the lightening was manufactured from a pennyworth of ro&s;in, and the end of a candle, &s;tuck in a tobacco-pipe, and blown into the room at proper inter|vals,
<PB N="174" REF="191">
by Stamford's man, Sam's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant. The other embelli&s;hments pro|ceeded entirely from the active imagi|nations of the relators.</P>
<P>I DARE &s;ay you think it &s;trange that I have wrote two letters without men|tioning my marriage that is to be. Mi&s;s Stamford is a remarkably beau|tiful girl; but, was either indi&s;po&s;ed, during my &s;tay, or, wants that vivacity that is &s;o particularly engaging in her &s;ex. But &s;he has &s;en&s;e and judgment, and will do well enough for a wife.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. Mr. ALWYN, to Mr. STAMFORD, Jun.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY little anxieties, which ro&s;e in &s;pite of me every time I recol|lected the facing of an audience, are, in a great mea&s;ure, removed. I have played, and met with more applau&s;e than it was po&s;&s;ible I could de&s;erve. Appearances at fir&s;t, indeed, were not &s;o favourable; the moment I went upon the &s;tage I was &s;aluted from a corner of the gal|lery with a piercing hi&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble to de&s;cribe my feelings when I heard it, and, had not the greater and the more indulgent part of the &s;pectators imme|diately overpowered this mark of di&s;|approbation, I &s;hould certainly have been obliged to retire, or have &s;unk to the floor, my trepedation was &s;o great. I
<PB N="176" REF="193">
felt ten thou&s;and aukwardne&s;&s;es, the moi&s;ture departed from my mouth, my knees knocked together, my lips quiver|ed, my throat became parched, my heart fluttered, and a qualmi&s;h &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized me. What gave me courage, &s;ufficient to proceed, was the behaviour of a young gentleman, of rank and fortune in this place, who&s;e name was We&s;twood. Im|mediately, when the hi&s;s began, he jumped up from his &s;eat, in the pit, for we have no boxes here, and, as &s;oon as he could be heard, reproached the di&s;&s;ati&s;fied aloud, in a very &s;pirited and pointed manner; and offered ten pounds to any man who would &s;ecure the next per&s;on that interrupted me; then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, &s;aid <Q>Bravo, Mr. Alwyn, take a little time, recol|lect your&s;elf, Sir, and let me hear who dares in&s;ult you again, damn me if I
<PB N="177" REF="194">
don't go up and twi&s;t the fir&s;t fellow's neck round that attempts it.</Q></P>
<P>THIS apo&s;trophe was the be&s;t cordial that could be admini&s;tered. My powers returned enough to enable me to make a very re&s;pectful bow to the audience, and to young 'Squire We&s;twood in par|ticular; which was an&s;wered by the &s;pec|tators, with the loude&s;t marks of appro|bation, three times repeated; and I heard &s;everal commendations on my per&s;on and deportment, before the hou&s;e was quiet &s;ufficiently for me to proceed, which gave me great encouragement.</P>
<P>I SHOULD, perhaps, be vain upon the fame I acquired, and the plaudits I after|wards received, were it po&s;&s;ible for me to enjoy plea&s;ure, and were I not con|&s;cious that a va&s;t deal, if not all, of the&s;e favours, may be placed to the account of
<PB N="178" REF="195">
good-nature, and the patronage of Mr. We&s;twood, who is univer&s;ally beloved. After I had fini&s;hed my part, mo&s;t of the people in the pit left the hou&s;e, and did not &s;tay to &s;ee the farce, which was played to the gallery. Several of the principal gentlemen came behind the &s;cenes, and in&s;i&s;ted upon my going to &s;upper with them; but as they were in different parties, that they might not embarra&s;s me, and out of re&s;pect and gratitude to the behaviour of my young &s;pirited patron, they permitted me to go with him, each laying me under the injunction of a vi&s;it in turn. I received likewi&s;e an invitation to their a&s;&s;embly on Thur&s;day next, at which I perceived my brother comedians were a good deal chagrined; for, as I have &s;ince learnt, one of them, no longer ago than the la&s;t time that they were here, was in&s;ulted for attempting to join with the gentry in
<PB N="179" REF="196">
this amu&s;ement, and the comedian being a man of &s;pirit, had his opponents been as valiant &s;ingly as they were conjointly, the affair might have been an unhappy one. I am not therefore determined, at pre&s;ent, what mea&s;ures I &s;hall pur&s;ue in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I AM informed, that the hi&s;&s;ing that was heard on my appearance, was the effect of a party rai&s;ed again&s;t me by the chicanery and malice of a Mr. Trun|cheon Stentor, the per&s;on who u&s;ed to play the character of Romeo, previous to my arrival in the company, and who, they &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding that he is be|come old and decrepit, is mo&s;t tenaci|ou&s;ly fond of appearing in youthful characters. I, however, do not believe this report, but attribute it to the de|traction of the actors, who, I perceive, circulate a thou&s;and little, mean anec|dotes,
<PB N="180" REF="197">
which place their brethren in ri|diculous or unfavourable attitudes. Stentor, in&s;tead of &s;eeming envious, at|tended me during every rehear&s;al, told me the entrances and exits; in&s;tructed me in &s;everal &s;tage manoeuvres, that were, not only very &s;erviceable, but, ab|&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to me; &s;tood behind the &s;cenes, gave me the greate&s;t encou|ragement at fir&s;t, and encomiums after|wards; in &s;hort, in&s;tead of manife&s;ting the lea&s;t rancour, or ill-nature, afforded me every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, and was exceedingly plea&s;ed with my &s;ucce&s;s. I, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e my own embarra&s;&s;|ment and aukwardne&s;s, which, perhaps, I was too &s;en&s;ible of, &s;hewed me to a di&s;advantage; and &s;ome, who wi&s;hed to pa&s;s for critics, hi&s;&s;ed more to prove their judgment than out of any ma|levolence to me, to whom it was im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have conceived any
<PB N="181" REF="198">
per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t, and who, it is not pro|bable, were to be influenced to any &s;uch meanne&s;s as the &s;uppo&s;ition contains.</P>
<P>I WAS received by the parents of Mr. We&s;twood, who were not at the play, with an affability that has given me a high idea of their &s;uperiority and goodne&s;s; for indeed I know no title to &s;uperi|ority but what is derived from good|ne&s;s. He is their only child, and the reciprocal delight which they afford to each other is very apparent and plea&s;ing; they live upon the mo&s;t friend|ly terms among the gentry of Kendal; &s;everal, therefore, who heard that I &s;up|ped here, came in with the utmo&s;t fa|miliarity, and behaved to me in &s;uch a manner as could not fail to give me plea&s;ure. Mr. We&s;twood, and &s;ome of his friends, are great admirers of mu&s;ic. After &s;upper we had a little concert, in
<PB N="182" REF="199">
which I a&s;&s;i&s;ted alternately on the violin, the flute, and as a vocal performer. They have no elevated ideas of ta&s;te, and appeared a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;pecimens I afforded them. Mu&s;ic, indeed, is &s;o much my delight, that if it were po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould excel in any thing, I believe it would be in that: but, however great the natural abilities of the people who were pre&s;ent might be, yet, as they have no opportunities of hearing good per|formers, I do not &s;o much wonder at their &s;urprize. It is in vain, dear Charles, that I endeavour to be chearful. I cannot remember the name of happi|ne&s;s without recollecting your &s;i&s;ter. Maria and Maitland haunt my imagi|nation. Tell me, Charles, will not his wild and excentric temper be very oppo&s;ite to the mildne&s;s of my poor Maria. Tell me if you think &s;he can be happy with him. I am afraid not.
<PB N="183" REF="200">
I fear tho&s;e extravagant &s;allies, into which his ungovernable fancy hurries him, will alarm her delicate mind with continual inquietudes. Yet why &s;hould I fear? He mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf, if he could bear to give &s;uch an angel pain. Oh my friend! how ble&s;t, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of increa&s;e, mu&s;t the man be who calls Maria his! But who is he that can &s;ay, with ju&s;tice, he de&s;erves &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing? What are riches, ho|nours, titles or power? Can they afford the happine&s;s that may be found in the conver&s;ation, the &s;miles, the tender at|tentions of the lovely Maria? My only con&s;olation is, that I can never merit her. I &s;hall never behold him who can. Where is there, in all the works of nature, an object &s;o perfect as a beauteous fe|male, when her pa&s;&s;ions are in uni&s;on with her features? Such is Maria.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Mr. STAMFORD, Jun. to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAITLAND and I arrived here on Tue&s;day night, and though I cannot &s;ay without any adventures on the road, yet without any worth relat|ing in a letter. Old Mr. Maitland re|ceived us with a chearful welcome, that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in his favour, and has walked with me this morning over his farm. He is very different from the &s;ort of character I had previou&s;ly form|ed in my mind. Not at all moro&s;e, or dogmatical; but, on the contrary, chear|ful and entertaining; his fancy, &s;tored with the beauties of the cla&s;&s;ic writers, has &s;hewn it&s;elf in the environs of his hou&s;e. It is &s;ituated in a vale, that
<PB N="186" REF="203">
might vie with the celebrated Temp&eacute;. At &s;ome little di&s;tance runs a river, who&s;e craggy and romantic banks engage the attention, while the fo&s;&s;ils in its bed afford an endle&s;s fund of amu&s;ement for the naturali&s;t. To the north, on a ri&s;ing hill, &s;tands an elegant temple, on eight Corinthian columns of variegated marble. This is his ob&s;ervatory, and is well furni&s;hed with in&s;truments, by the mo&s;t capital makers. The view, from hence, is plea&s;ing beyond de&s;crip|tion. Several natural openings, in the groves which &s;urround the hou&s;e, di&s;|cover a variety of pro&s;pects, each of which has its peculiar beauties; and grottoes, alcoves, with other little edi|fices di&s;per&s;ed here and there, con&s;pire to lull the imagination into a delightful tranquillity.</P>
<Q><L>Here could I ever &s;tray, while the wrapt mind</L>
<L>Recalls the long lo&s;t tale of many a hero,</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="204">Or many a &s;age, who, from the mountain top,</L>
<L>Unwearied, watches Cynthia's &s;ilver cour&s;e,</L>
<L>When nightly, from the ea&s;t, &s;low ri&s;ing, &s;he</L>
<L>Illumes the azure heav'n with &s;often'd light.</L></Q>
<P>As we walked together, through the&s;e plea&s;ant &s;cenes, our conver&s;ation turned on a variety of &s;ubjects, but all of the literate kind. He was plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve, I had a ta&s;te for the &s;ciences; and I, on the other hand, was &s;urprized at the refined judgment he di&s;played in matters of imagination, having expect|ed to find him immer&s;ed in mathemati|cal &s;peculations. He certainly ab&s;tracts too much, and expects to attain a &s;tate of knowledge beyond what our faculties are capable of. The objects of ta&s;te, &s;ays he, it mu&s;t be allowed, con&s;titute in them&s;elves the nobler exerci&s;es of the &s;oul: the philo&s;ophy of the pa&s;&s;ions is worthy the attention of mankind: the &s;ource, the ultimate ba&s;is of morality
<PB N="188" REF="205">
is of the la&s;t con&s;equence to &s;ociety, and well de&s;erves to be enquired into.&mdash;But we lo&s;e our&s;elves in conjecture, in&s;tead of &s;eeking for demon&s;tration. Would not you &s;mile, Mr. Stamford, at the &s;age, who, to explain the <HI>motion</HI> of a planet, &s;hould &s;ay it proceeded from a <HI>motive</HI> faculty, in&s;tead of inve&s;tigating the re&s;pective momenta and directions of the projectile and centripetal forces? Is not certainty in the lower &s;teps of &s;cience an acqui&s;ition more to be prized than the declamations of prejudice, or the endle&s;s maze of proofs founded on hypothe&s;is? Nay, rather, ought we not fir&s;t to make our&s;elves perfect in the rudiments of knowledge, before we pry into the arcana of the more &s;ubtle mo|tions of intellectual &s;ub&s;tances? De|mon&s;tration is not confined to quantity alone. Ideas of the great and beautiful in nature, in &s;entiment, in ethics, and
<PB N="189" REF="206">
in all the branches of the &s;entient fa|culty, are as perfect as tho&s;e of quan|tity, and their congruity with each other as perceptible. By the immediate application of two ideas an axiom may be formed. Definitions of terms &s;hould be premi&s;ed; and, by the intervention of a chain of immediately concordant ideas, we might connect the propo&s;ition and con&s;equence. Whence demon&s;tra|tion would be accompli&s;hed, and a man would no more doubt the beauty, order, or moral fitne&s;s of a well-grounded a&s;|&s;ertion, than the truth of a theorem in Euclid.</P>
<P>YOU will perceive the turn of his mind by this &s;pecimen. The &s;ame mode of thinking accompanies him in his other pur&s;uits. He is constantly employed in &s;ome re&s;earch, either in the intellectual or material world; and,
<PB N="190" REF="207">
his faculty of drawing conclu&s;ions from experiments, is admirable; though it &s;ometimes &s;ubjects him to errors, of which his &s;on &s;eldom fails to take ad|vantage, he being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of capital talents for placing every object in the mo&s;t ludicrous attitude. The country people are of opinion, that the old gentleman can conjure, and &s;ay that the little temple, on the hill, was built nobody knows how; but the pari&s;h clerk, who pretends to be very wi&s;e, &s;ays it was done by geometry, all in one night. Mr. Maitland is too rich to be a wizard; but I am informed, that an old woman, who lives in a hut, on the verge of his farm, has the repu|tation of doing all the mi&s;chiefs that they are plea&s;ed to a&s;cribe to &s;upernatu|ral agents. This report is the more confirmed by &s;everal vi&s;its he has lately
<PB N="191" REF="208">
made her, doubtle&s;s, with a view of re|lieving her nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>HIS hou&s;e is of a moderate &s;ize, and elegantly fini&s;hed in the modern &s;tile. The <HI>&s;implex munditiis</HI> is &s;een in every part of it, unle&s;s I may except certain apartments, which are con&s;ecrated to philo&s;ophical u&s;es. He has a variety of the be&s;t apparatus, which, according to the tenor of his prevailing &s;tudy, is di&s;per&s;ed on &s;tands and tables appro|priated for its reception. I promi&s;e my&s;elf much amu&s;ement from hence, when the weather confines me at home; but am too great an admirer of the more obvious phaenomena of nature to &s;tay within, when I can enjoy my|&s;elf in the open air.</P>
<P>YOUNG Maitland makes the mo&s;t of his time in hunting or &s;hooting. We &s;ee
<PB N="192" REF="209">
very little of him, except when he has the complai&s;ance to a&s;&s;i&s;t at &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophical re&s;earch, in doing which he is &s;o ingenious at finding means to exer|ci&s;e his ri&s;ible faculty that I wonder at his father's patience.&mdash;A propos of this youth, he is no favourite with my father, and &s;till le&s;s with Maria. I am convinced, if the intended match takes place, it will be more out of regard to his promi&s;e, and the &s;teps he has taken in the affair, than to any wi&s;h he has to proceed.</P>
