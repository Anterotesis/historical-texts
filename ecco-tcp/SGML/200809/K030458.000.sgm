<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE high admiration I ever felt for the &s;uperior talents you have &s;o eminently di&s;played in ALMEYDA, could alone have induced me to venture a &s;econd drama|tick production. To that admiration, a more intimate knowledge of you, has added an e&s;teem; which is, I flat|ter my&s;elf, reciprocal. Not all the various charms you dignify the Drama with, can equal tho&s;e of your &s;ympa|thizing mind, and una&s;&s;uming manners.&mdash;When thus united, they form a character it would be vanity to prai&s;e, tho' virtue to delight in. With true gratitude,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT was with no le&s;s awe than deference I ventured, in the pre&s;ent day, to bring a Tragedy before the Publick. How great, then, mu&s;t be my gratitude for the liberal acceptation it has met, and the tears with which it has been honoured. I mu&s;t have wanted ta&s;te and feeling, not to have been animated, by the exqui&s;ite talents of Mrs. SIDDONS, into an exertion of &s;uch as I po&s;&s;e&s;s. That I have been the means of di&s;playing, in a new point of view, her various powers, is a mo&s;t flattering recompence.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of ALMEYDA is wholly a fiction; and the incident which produces the cata&s;trophe the only one not my own.&mdash;The deep impre&s;&s;ion made on me, long &s;ince, by a &s;imilar <HI>denouement,</HI> in an old play of JAMES SHIR|LEY's, determined me to apply it.</P>
<P>The Stage requires a compre&s;&s;ion and brevity, which &s;eldom improves a play to the reader: I have, therefore, printed ALMEYDA at length, marking by inverted commas the parts omitted in repre&s;entation.</P>

<L>THE Mu&s;es long through many a varying age,</L>

<L>Applauding Greece the numbers lov'd to hear,</L>
<L>And her &s;tern warriors gave the graceful tear.</L>
<L>At length her venal train Corruption led,</L>
<L>And, with the Virtues link'd, the mu&s;es fled</L>
<L>O'er Albion's happy land they paus'd awhile,</L>
