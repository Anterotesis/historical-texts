<L>QUOTH Richard to Bob, "let things go as they will,</L>
<L>"Of plea&s;ure and fun I will &s;till have my fill;</L>
<L>"In a little gay Joy I &s;ee nothing ami&s;s,</L>
<L>"And tho' now and then tip&s;y, <HI>what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For e'en Solomon &s;ays, and I vow he &s;ays truth,</L>
<L>"'Rejoice, O young man, in the days of thy youth'&mdash;</L>
<L>"I am glad" (an&s;wer'd Bob) "you're of Solomon's creed,</L>
<L>"But I beg if you quote him you'll plea&s;e to proceed;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For God" (as the wi&s;e man continues to &s;ing)</L>
<L>"Thy &s;oul into Judgment for all this will bring.</L>
<L>"Thus a man may get plung'd in a woeful aby&s;s,</L>
<L>"By chu&s;ing to &s;ay, <HI>Pray what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Come, Come" (&s;ays gay Richard) "don't grudge me a "Cup;</L>
<L>I'm re&s;olv'd, while I'm able, I'll &s;till keep it up;</L>
<L>"Let old Greybeards deny that in frolic's there's bli&s;s;</L>
<L>"I'll game, love, and drink&mdash;<HI>and what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says Robert, "I grant if you live for to-day,</L>
<L>"You may game, love, and drink, and may frolic away;</L>
<L>"But then, my dear Dick, I again mu&s;t contend,</L>
<L>"That the wi&s;e man has bid us <HI>remember the end."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says Richard, "when &s;ickne&s;s or peevi&s;h old age,</L>
<L>"Shall advance to di&s;mi&s;s me from life's merry &s;tage;</L>
<L>"Repentance ju&s;t then, Boy, may not be ami&s;s,</L>
<L>"But while young I'll be jolly&mdash;<HI>what harm is in this?"</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They parted&mdash;and Richard his pa&s;times begun,</L>
<L>'Twas Richard the Jovial, the &s;oul of all fun;</L>
<L>Each dancing bout, drinking bout, Dick would attend,</L>
<L>And he &s;ung and he &s;wore&mdash;<HI>nor once thought of the End.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young Molly he courted, the pride of the plain,</L>
<L>He promis'd her marriage, but promis'd in vain;</L>
<L>She tru&s;ted his vows, but &s;he &s;oon was undone,</L>
<L>And when &s;he fell weeping he thought it good fun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus &s;corn'd by her Richard &s;ad Molly run wild,</L>
<L>And roam'd thro' the woods with her de&s;titute child;</L>
<L>'Till poor Molly and Molly's poor Baby were found</L>
<L>One evening in Richard's own mill pond both drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then his con&s;cience grew troubl'd by night and by day,</L>
<L>But it's clamour he drown'd in more drink and more play;</L>
<L>Still Robert exhorted, and like a true friend,</L>
<L>He warn'd him he pray'd him&mdash;<HI>to think on the End.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now di&s;turb'd in his dreams poor Molly each night</L>
<L>With her babe &s;tood before him; how &s;ad was the &s;ight!</L>
<L>O how gha&s;tly &s;he look'd as &s;he bade him attend,</L>
<L>And &s;o awfully told him&mdash;<HI>"Remember the End."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She talk'd of the woes and unquenchable fire</L>
<L>Which await the gay Sinner, the Drunkard, and Liar;</L>
<L>How he ruin'd more maidens &s;he bade him beware,</L>
<L>Then &s;he wept, and &s;he groan'd, and &s;he vani&s;h'd in air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now beggar'd by Gaming, di&s;temper'd by Drink,</L>
<L>Death &s;tar'd in his face, yet he dar'd not to think;</L>
<L>De&s;pairing of mercy, de&s;pi&s;ing all truth,</L>
<L>He dy'd of old age in the prime of his youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On his Tomb&s;tone good Robert the&s;e Ver&s;es engraved,</L>
<L>Which he hop'd &s;ome gay fellow might read and be &s;av'd.</L>
