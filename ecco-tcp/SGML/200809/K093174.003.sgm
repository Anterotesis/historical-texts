<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gave me the definition of a hor&s;e &s;ome time ago&mdash;Pray, Sir, how is a Man defined?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is worth enquiring. Let us con&s;ider, then. He mu&s;t ei|ther &s;tand by him&s;elf, or be ranked among the quadrupeds; for there are no other two-legged animals but birds, which he certainly does not re&s;emble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can he be made a qua|druped?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>By &s;etting him to crawl on the ground, in which ca&s;e he will as much re&s;emble a baboon, as a baboon &s;et on his hind-legs does a man. In reality, there is little difference between the arms of a man and the fore-legs of a
<PB N="2" REF="5">
quadruped; and in all other circum|&s;tances of internal and external &s;truc|ture, they are evidently formed upon the &s;ame model.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then we mu&s;t call him a digitated quadruped that generally goes upon his hind-legs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>A naturali&s;t could not reckon him otherwi&s;e; and accordingly Lin|naeus has placed him in the &s;ame divi|&s;ion with apes, macocos, and bats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apes, macocos, and bats!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;they have all four cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and teats on the brea&s;t. How do you like your rela|tions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we will get rid of them by applying to the other part of human nature&mdash;the <HI>mind.</HI> Man is an animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and the only one. This, therefore, is enough to define him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard that man is a
<PB N="3" REF="6">
rational creature, and I have a notion what that means; but I &s;hould like to have an exact definition of rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rea&s;on is the faculty by which we compare ideas and draw conclu&s;ions. A man walking in the woods of an un|known country finds a bow. He com|pares it in his mind with other bows, and forms the conclu&s;ion that it mu&s;t have been made by man, and that therefore the country is probably inha|bited. He di&s;covers a hut; &s;ees in it half-burnt wood, and finds that the a&s;hes are not quite cold. He con|cludes, therefore, with certainty, not only that there are inhabitants, but that they cannot be far di&s;tant. No other animal could do this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would not a dog who had been u&s;ed to live with men, run into &s;uch a hut and expect to find people in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>He probably would&mdash;and this, I acknowledge, is very like rea&s;on; for
<PB N="4" REF="7">
he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to compare in his mind the hut he has lived in with that he &s;ees, and to conclude, that as there were men in the fir&s;t, there are in the la&s;t. But how little a way does this carry him? He finds no men there, and he is unable by any marks to form a judgment how long they have been ab&s;ent, or what &s;ort of people they were; &s;till le&s;s does he form any plan of conduct in con&s;equence of his di&s;|covery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then is not the difference only that man has much rea&s;on, and brutes little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we adhere to the mere words of the definition of rea&s;on, I believe this mu&s;t be admitted; but in the ex|erci&s;e of it, the &s;uperiority of the hu|man faculties is &s;o great, that man is in many points ab&s;olutely di&s;tingui&s;hed from brutes. In the fir&s;t place he has the <HI>u&s;e of &s;peech,</HI> which no other animal has attained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot many animals make them|&s;elves under&s;tood by one another by their cries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They can make known a few of their common wants and de&s;ires, but they cannot <HI>di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> or communicate ideas &s;tored up in the memory. It is this faculty which makes man an <HI>im|proveable</HI> being, the wi&s;dom and expe|rience acquired by one individual being thus tran&s;mitted to others, and &s;o on, in an endle&s;s &s;eries of progre&s;&s;ion. There is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the dogs of the pre&s;ent day are more know|ing than tho&s;e which lived a thou&s;and years ago; but the men of this age are much better acquainted with numberle&s;s arts and &s;ciences than their remote an|ce&s;tors; &s;ince by the u&s;e of &s;peech, and of writing (which is &s;peech addre&s;&s;ed to the eye), every age adds its own di&s;coveries to all former ones. This knowledge of the pa&s;t likewi&s;e gives man a great in&s;ight into the future.
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Shake&s;pear excellently defines man by &s;aying that he is a creature <Q REND="inline">"made with large di&s;cour&s;e, looking before and after."</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Animals mu&s;t &s;urely know &s;ome|thing of the future, when they lay up a &s;tore of provi&s;ions for the winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;it is pretty certain that this is not the ca&s;e, for they will do it as much the fir&s;t year of their lives as any other. Young bees turned out of a live, as &s;oon as they have &s;warmed and got a habitation, begin laying up honey, though they cannot po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee the u&s;e they &s;hall have for it. There are a va&s;t number of actions of this kind in animals, which are directed to an u&s;eful end, but an end which the animal knows nothing of. And this is what we call <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> and properly di&s;|tingui&s;h from rea&s;on. Man has le&s;s of it than almo&s;t any other animal, be|cau&s;e he wants it le&s;s. Another point of e&s;&s;ential difference is that man is the
<PB N="7" REF="10">
only animal that makes u&s;e of <HI>in&s;tru|ments</HI> in any of his actions. He is a <HI>tool-making</HI> and <HI>machine-making</HI> animal. By means of this faculty alone he is every where lord of the creation, and has equally triumphed over the &s;ubtlety of the cunning, the &s;wiftne&s;s of the fleet, and the force of the &s;trong. He is the only animal that has found out the u&s;e of <HI>fire,</HI> a mo&s;t important acqui&s;ition!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read of &s;ome large apes that will come and &s;it round a fire in the woods when men have left it, but have not the &s;en&s;e to keep it in, by throwing on &s;ticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still le&s;s then could they light a fire. In con&s;equence of this di&s;covery man cooks his food, which no other animal does. He alone fences again&s;t the cold by cloathing as well as by fire. He alone cultivates the earth, and keeps living animals for future u&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have not there been wild men
<PB N="8" REF="11">
bred in the woods that could do none of the&s;e things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some in&s;tances of this kind are recorded, and they are not to be won|dered at; for man was meant to be a <HI>gregarious</HI> animal, or one living in &s;o|ciety, in which alone his faculties have full &s;cope, and e&s;pecially his power of improving by the u&s;e of &s;peech. The&s;e poor &s;olitary creatures, brought up with the brutes, were in a &s;tate entirely un|natural to them. A &s;olitary bee, ant, or beaver, would have none of the &s;kill and &s;agacity of tho&s;e animals in their proper &s;ocial condition. Society &s;harp|ens all the faculties, and gives ideas and views which never could have been en|tertained by an individual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;ome men that live in &s;ociety &s;eem to be little above the brutes, at lea&s;t when compared to other men. What is a Hottentot in compari&s;on to one of us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>The difference, indeed, is great, but we agree in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential cha|racters of <HI>man,</HI> and perhaps the advan|tage is not all on our &s;ide. The Hot|tentot cultivates the earth, and rears cattle. He not only herds with his fellows, but he has in&s;tituted &s;ome &s;ort of government for the protection of the weak again&s;t the &s;trong. He has a no|tion of right and wrong, and is &s;en|&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of controuling pre|&s;ent appetites and pa&s;&s;ions for the &s;ake of a future good. He has therefore <HI>morals.</HI> He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of weapons, tools, cloathing, and furniture, of his own making. In agility of body, and the knowledge of various circum&s;tances relative to the nature of animals, he &s;urpa&s;&s;es us. His inferiority lies in tho&s;e things in which many of the low|e&s;t cla&s;s among us are almo&s;t equally inferior to the in&s;tructed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Hottentots have no notion of a God, or a future &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not certain how far that is fact; but, alas! how many among us have no knowledge at all on tho&s;e &s;ub|jects, or only &s;ome vague notions, full of ab&s;urdity and &s;uper&s;tition! People far advanced in civilization have enter|tained the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors on tho&s;e &s;ub|jects, which are only to be corrected by the &s;erious application of rea&s;on, or by a direct revelation from heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;aid man was an <HI>improveable</HI> creature&mdash;but have not many nations been a long time in a &s;avage &s;tate with|out improvement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Man is always <HI>capable of improve|ment;</HI> but he may exi&s;t a long time, even in &s;ociety, without <HI>actually improv|ing</HI> beyond a certain point. There is little improvement among nations who have not the <HI>art of writing,</HI> for tradi|tion is not capable of pre&s;erving very accurate or exten&s;ive knowledge; and many arts and &s;ciences, after flouri&s;h|ing greatly, have been entirely lo&s;t, in
<PB N="11" REF="14">
countries which have been overrun by barbarous and illiterate nations. Then there is a principle which I might have mentioned as one of tho&s;e that di&s;tin|gui&s;h man from brutes, but it as much di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome men from others. This is <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> or the love of know|ledge for its own &s;ake. Mo&s;t &s;avages have little or nothing of this; but with|out it we &s;hould want one of the chief inducements to exert our faculties. It is curio&s;ity that impels us to &s;earch into the properties of every part of nature, to try all &s;orts of experiments, to vi&s;it di&s;tant regions, and even to examine the appearances and motions of the heavenly bodies. Every fact thus di&s;|covered leads to other facts; and there is no limit to be &s;et to this progre&s;s. The time may come, when what we now know may &s;eem as much ignorance to future ages, as the knowledge of early times does to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What nations know the mo&s;t at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Europeans have long been di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;uperior ardour after knowledge, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s beyond all compari&s;on the greate&s;t &s;hare of it, whereby they have been enabled to command the re&s;t of the world. The countries in which the arts and &s;ciences mo&s;t flouri&s;h at pre&s;ent, are the northern and middle parts of Europe, and al&s;o North America, which, you know, is inhabited by de&s;cendants of Euro|peans. In the&s;e countries man may be &s;aid to be <HI>mo&s;t man;</HI> and they may ap|ply to them&s;elves the poet's boa&s;t,<Q><L><HI>Man</HI> is the nobler growth the&s;e realms &s;upply,</L>

<P>Well, Sir&mdash;As our John was coming from work one evening, he &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance on the road a carrier's waggon over-turned. He ran up to help, and found a poor old gentlewo|man lying on the bank much hurt, and this girl &s;itting be&s;ide her, crying. My
<PB N="17" REF="20">
good man, after he had helped in &s;et|ting the waggon to rights, went to them, and with a good deal of difficulty got the gentlewoman into the waggon again, and walked by the &s;ide of it to our hou&s;e. He called me out, and we got &s;ome|thing comfortable for her; but &s;he was &s;o ill that &s;he could not bear to be car|ried further. So after con&s;ulting a while, we took her into the hou&s;e, and put her to bed. Her head was &s;adly hurt, and &s;he &s;eemed to grow wor&s;e in&s;tead of better. We got a doctor to her, and did our be&s;t to nur&s;e her, but all would not do, and we &s;oon found &s;he was likely to die. Poor Fanny, her grandaughter, never left her day nor night; and it would have gone to your honour's heart to have heard the pitiful moan &s;he made over her. She was the only friend &s;he had in the world, &s;he &s;aid; and what would become of her if &s;he were to lo&s;e her? Fanny's father and mother were both dead, and
<PB N="18" REF="21">
&s;he was going with her grandmother into the north, where the old gentle|woman came from, to live cheap, and try to find out &s;ome relations. Well&mdash;to make my &s;tory &s;hort, in a few days the poor woman died. There was little more money about her than would &s;erve to pay the doctor and bury her. Fanny was in &s;ad trouble indeed. I thought &s;he would never have left her grandmother's grave. She cried and wrung her hands mo&s;t bitterly. But I tire your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Landl.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no! I am much intere&s;ted in your &s;tory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>We comforted her as well as we could; but all her cry was, What will become of me? Where mu&s;t I go? Who will take care of me? So after a while, &s;aid I to John, Poor crea|ture! my heart grieves for her. Per|haps &s;he would like to &s;tay with us&mdash;though &s;he &s;eems to have been brought up in a way of living different from
<PB N="19" REF="22">
ours, too;&mdash;but what can &s;he do, left to her&s;elf in the wide world? So my hu&s;band agreed that I &s;hould a&s;k her. When I mentioned it to her, poor thing! how her countenance altered. O, &s;aid &s;he, I wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as to &s;tay and live with you! I am afraid I can do but little to &s;erve you, but indeed I will learn and do my be&s;t. Said I, Do no more than you like; you are welcome to &s;tay and par|take with us as long as you plea&s;e. Well, Sir! &s;he &s;taid with us; and &s;et about learning to do all kind of our work with &s;uch good will, and &s;o handi|ly, that &s;he &s;oon became my be&s;t help|er. And &s;he is &s;o &s;weet-tempered, and &s;o fond of us and the children, that I love her as well as if &s;he was my own child. She has been well brought up, I am &s;ure. She can read and write, and work with her needle, a great deal better than we can, and when work is over &s;he teaches the children. Then

<P>Ah! 'tis the very &s;ame&mdash;every circum&s;tance corre&s;ponds! My dear Fanny <STAGE>(taking her hand)</STAGE>  you have found a relation when you little thought of it. I am your kin&s;man. My mo|ther was a Borrowdale of We&s;tmore|land, and half-&s;i&s;ter to your grandmo|ther. I have heard of all your parent|age;
<PB N="22" REF="25">
and I remember the death of your poor father, who was a very hone&s;t in|genious arti&s;t; and of your mother &s;oon after, of a broken heart.

My wife and daughters will be very glad to re|ceive one who&s;e conduct has done her &s;o much credit.</P>

<LG>
<L>This <HI>tit for tat,</HI> it &s;eems, not men alone,</L>

<L>In proof of this a &s;tory I &s;hall tell ye,</L>
<L>Imported from the famous town of Delhi.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A mighty Elephant that &s;well'd the &s;tate</L>

<L>One day was taken by his driver</L>
<L>To drink and cool him in the river.</L>
<L>The driver on his neck was &s;eated,</L>
<L>And as he rode along,</L>
<L>By &s;ome acquaintance in the throng,</L>
<L>With a ripe cocoa-nut was treated.</L>
</LG>

<L>A cocoa-nut's a pretty fruit enough,</L>
<L>But guarded by a &s;hell, both hard and tough.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="33">
The fellow tried, and tried, and tried,</L>

<L>An Elephant, they &s;ay, has human feeling,</L>

<L><PB N="31" REF="34">
But Elephant within his mem'ry hid it;</L>

<HEAD>TWELFTH EVENING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="piece">
<HEAD>ON WINE AND SPIRITS.</HEAD>
<P>GEORGE and Harry, accompanied by their Tutor, went one day to pay a vi&s;it to a neighbouring gentleman, their fa|ther's friend. They were very kindly received, and &s;hewn all about the gar|dens and plea&s;ure grounds; but nothing took their fancy &s;o much as an exten&s;ive grapery, hung round with bunches of various kinds fully ripe, and almo&s;t too big for the vines to &s;upport. They were liberally treated with the fruit, and carried away &s;ome bunches to eat as they walked. During their return, as they were picking their grapes, &s;aid George to the Tutor, A thought is ju&s;t come into my head, Sir. Wine, you know, is called the juice of the grape;
<PB N="33" REF="36">
but wine is hot, and intoxicates peo|ple that drink much of it. Now we have had a good deal of grape juice this morning, and yet I do not feel heated, nor does it &s;eem at all to have got into our heads. What is the rea&s;on of this?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rea&s;on is, that grape-juice is not wine, though wine is made from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray how is it made, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you; for it is a matter worth knowing. The juice pre&s;&s;ed from grapes, called <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> is at fir&s;t a &s;weet watery liquor, with a little tart|ne&s;s, but with no &s;trength or &s;pirit. After it has &s;tood a while, it begins to grow thick and muddy, it moves up and down, and throws &s;cum and bubbles of air to the &s;urface. This is called <HI>working</HI> or <HI>fermenting.</HI> It continues in this &s;tate for &s;ome time, more or le&s;s, according to the quality of the juice and the temperature of the weather, and
<PB N="34" REF="37">
then gradually &s;ettles again, becoming clearer than at fir&s;t. It has now lo&s;t its &s;weet flat ta&s;te, and acquired a bri&s;kne&s;s and pungency, with a heating and in|toxicating property; that is, it has be|come <HI>wine.</HI> This natural proce&s;s is called the <HI>vinous fermentation,</HI> and many liquors be&s;ides grape juice are capable of undergoing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of the working of beer and ale. Is that of the &s;ame kind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; and beer and ale may pro|perly be called barley-wine; for you know they are clear, bri&s;k, and intoxi|cating. In the &s;ame manner, cyder is apple-wine, and mead is honey-wine; and you have heard of rai&s;in and currant wine, and a great many others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is elder-wine and cow&s;lip-wine, and orange-wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will every thing of that &s;ort make wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>All vegetable juices that are &s;weet
<PB N="35" REF="38">
are capable of fermenting, and of pro|ducing a liquor of a vinous nature; but if they have little &s;weetne&s;s, the liquor is proportionally weak and poor, and is apt to become &s;our or vapid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But barley is not &s;weet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Barley as it comes from the ear is not; but before it is u&s;ed for brew|ing, it is made into <HI>malt,</HI> and then it is &s;en&s;ibly &s;weet. You know what malt is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een heaps of it in the malt-hou&s;e, but I do not know how it is made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Barley is made malt by putting it in heaps and wetting it, when it be|comes hot, and &s;wells, and would &s;prout out, ju&s;t as if it were &s;own, unle&s;s it were then dried in a kiln. By this operation it acquires a &s;weet ta&s;te. You have drunk &s;weetwort?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;this is made by &s;teeping malt in hot water. The water extracts and di&s;&s;olves all the &s;weet or &s;ugary
<PB N="36" REF="39">
part of the malt. It then becomes like a naturally &s;weet juice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would not &s;ugar and water then make wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would; and the wines made in England of our common fruits and flowers have all a good deal of &s;ugar in them. Cow&s;lip flowers, for example, give little more than the flavour to the wine named from them, and it is the &s;ugar added to them which properly makes the wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But none of the&s;e wines are &s;o good as grape-wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The grape, from the rich|ne&s;s and abundance of its juice, is the fruit univer&s;ally preferred for making wine, where it comes to perfection, which it &s;eldom does in our climate, except by means of artificial heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, then, grapes are fine&s;t in the hotte&s;t countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o, neither: they are pro|perly a fruit of the temperate zone, and
<PB N="37" REF="40">
do not grow well between the tropics. And in very hot countries it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to make wines of any kind to keep, for they ferment &s;o &s;trongly as to turn &s;our almo&s;t immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have read of palm-wine on the coa&s;t of Guinea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. A &s;weet juice flows abun|dantly from inci&s;ions in certain &s;pecies of the palm, which ferments immedi|ately, and makes a very plea&s;ant &s;ort of weak wine. But it mu&s;t be drunk the &s;ame day it is made, for on the next it is as &s;our as vinegar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is vinegar&mdash;is it not &s;our wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing that makes wine will make vinegar al&s;o; and the &s;tronger the wine, the &s;tronger the vinegar. The vinous fermentation mu&s;t be fir&s;t brought on, but it need not produce perfect wine; for when the intention is to make vine|gar, the liquor is kept &s;till warm, and it goes on without &s;topping to another
<PB N="38" REF="41">
kind of fermentation, called the <HI>acetous,</HI> the product of which is vinegar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of alegar. I &s;up|po&s;e that is vinegar made of ale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is&mdash;but as ale is not &s;o &s;trong as wine, the vinegar made from it is not &s;o &s;harp or perfect. But hou&s;e|wives make good vinegar with &s;ugar and water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will vinegar make people drunk if they take too much of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The wine lo&s;es its intoxi|cating quality as well as its ta&s;te, on turning to vinegar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are &s;pirituous liquors&mdash;have not they &s;omething to do with wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. They con&s;i&s;t of the &s;piritu|ous or intoxicating part of wine &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t. You may remem|ber that on talking of di&s;tillation, I told you that it was the rai&s;ing of a liquor in &s;team or vapour, and conden&s;ing it again; and that &s;ome liquors were more
<PB N="39" REF="42">
ea&s;ily turned to vapour than others, and were therefore called more volatile or evaporable. Now, wine is a mixed or compound liquor, of which the greater part is water, but what heats and in|toxicates is <HI>vinous &s;pirit.</HI> This &s;pirit, being much more volatile than water, on the application of a gentle heat, flies off in vapour, and may be collected by it&s;elf in di&s;tilling ve&s;&s;els;&mdash;and thus are made &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will every thing that you called wine, yield &s;pirits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; every thing that has under|gone the vinous fermentation. Thus, in England, a great deal of malt-&s;pirit is made from a kind of wort brought into fermentation, and then &s;et directly to di&s;til, without fir&s;t making ale or beer of it. Gin is a &s;pirituous liquor al&s;o got from corn, and flavoured with juniper berries. Even potatoes, car|rots, and turneps, may be made to af|ford &s;pirits, by fir&s;t fermenting their
<PB N="40" REF="43">
juices. In the We&s;t Indies rum is di&s;|tilled from the dregs of the &s;ugar canes wa&s;hed out by water and fermented. But brandy is di&s;tilled from the fer|mented juice of the grape, and is made in the wine countries.</P>

<P>Is &s;pirits of wine different from &s;pirituous liquors?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the &s;tronge&s;t part of them got by di&s;tilling over again; for all the&s;e &s;till contain a good deal of water, along with a pure &s;pirit, which may be &s;epa|rated by a gentler heat than was u&s;ed at fir&s;t. But in order to procure this as &s;trong and pure as po&s;&s;ible, it mu&s;t be di&s;tilled &s;everal times over, always leav|ing &s;ome of the watery part behind. When perfectly pure, it is the &s;ame, whatever &s;pirituous liquor it is got from.</P>

<P>My mamma has little bottles of lavender water. What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;pirit of wine flavoured with lavender flowers; and it may in like manner be flavoured with many other
<PB N="41" REF="44">
fragrant things, &s;ince their odoriferous part is volatile, and will ri&s;e in vapour along with the &s;pirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will not &s;pirits of wine burn vio|lently?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it will, I can tell you; and &s;o will rum and brandy, for you know it was &s;et on fire when we made &s;nap|dragon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>All &s;pirituous liquors are highly inflammable, and the more &s;o the purer they are. One way of trying the purity of &s;pirit is to &s;ee if it will burn all away without leaving any moi&s;ture behind. Then it is much lighter than water, and that affords another way of judging of its &s;trength. A hollow ivory ball is &s;et to &s;wim in it; and the deeper it &s;inks down, the lighter, and therefore the more &s;pirituous, is the liquor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard much of the mi&s;|chief done by &s;pirituous liquors&mdash;pray what good do they do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The u&s;e and abu&s;e of wine and
<PB N="42" REF="45">
&s;pirits is a very copious &s;ubject; and there is &s;carcely any gift of human art the general effects of which are more dubious. You know what wine is &s;aid to be given for in the bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make glad the heart of man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. And nothing has &s;uch an immediate effect in in&s;piring vigour of body and mind as wine. It bani&s;hes &s;orrow and care, recruits from fatigue, enlivens the fancy, inflames the courage, and performs a hundred fine things, of which I could bring you abundant proof from the poets. The phy&s;icians, too, &s;peak almo&s;t as much in its favour, both in diet and medicine. But its really good effects are only when u&s;ed in mo|deration; and it unfortunately is one of tho&s;e things which man can hardly be brought to u&s;e moderately. Exce&s;s in wine brings on effects the very contrary to its benefits. It &s;tupifies and enfeebles the mind, and fills the body with in|curable di&s;ea&s;es. And this it does even
<PB N="43" REF="46">
when u&s;ed without intoxication. But a drunken man lo&s;es for the time every di&s;tinction of a rea&s;onable creature, and becomes wor&s;e than a brute bea&s;t. On this account, Mahomet entirely forbid its u&s;e to his followers, and to this day it is not publicly drunk in any of the countries that receive the Mahometan religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not that right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not. If we were entirely to renounce every thing that may be mi&s;u&s;ed, we &s;hould have &s;carce any en|joyments left; and it is a proper exer|ci&s;e of our &s;trength of mind, to u&s;e good things with moderation, when we have it in our power to do otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;pirituous liquors are not good at all; are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have &s;o little good and &s;o much bad in them, that I confe&s;s I wi&s;h their common u&s;e could be aboli&s;hed altogether. They are generally taken by the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people for the ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="44" REF="47">
purpo&s;e of intoxication; and they are much &s;ooner prejudicial to the health than wine, and indeed, when drunk un|mixed, are no better than &s;low poi&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit of wine is u&s;eful, though, for &s;everal things&mdash;is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I would have all &s;pirits kept in the hands of chymi&s;ts and arti&s;ts who know how to employ them u&s;e|fully. Spirit of wine will di&s;&s;olve many things that water will not. Apotheca|ries u&s;e them in drawing tinctures, and arti&s;ts in preparing colours and mak|ing varni&s;hes. They are likewi&s;e very powerful pre&s;ervatives from corruption. You may have &s;een &s;erpents and in&s;ects brought from abroad in phials full of &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I know of another u&s;e of &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>To burn in lamps. My grand|mamma has a tea-kettle with a lamp
<PB N="45" REF="48">
under it to keep the water hot, and &s;he burns &s;pirits in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;he does. Well&mdash;&s;o much for the u&s;es of the&s;e liquors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have &s;aid nothing about ale and beer. Are they whole&s;ome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in moderation. But they are &s;adly abu&s;ed, too, and rob many men of their health as well as their mo|ney and &s;en&s;es.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Small beer does no harm, how|ever.</P>

<HEAD>THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Wi&s;eman, the &s;choolma&s;ter, at the end of his &s;ummer vacation, receiv|ed a new &s;cholar with the following let|ter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered to you by my &s;on Samuel, whom I beg leave to commit to your care, hoping that by your well-known &s;kill and at|tention you will be able to make &s;ome|thing of him; which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, none of his ma&s;ters have hitherto done. He is now eleven, and yet can do no|thing but read his mother tongue, and that but indifferently. We &s;ent him at &s;even to a grammar &s;chool in our neigh|bourhood; but his ma&s;ter &s;oon found that his genius was not turned to learn|ing languages. He was then put to writing, but he &s;et about it &s;o awkward|ly that he made nothing of it. He
<PB N="47" REF="50">
was tried at accounts, but it appeared that he had no genius for that, neither. He could do nothing in geography for want of memory. In &s;hort, if he has any genius at all, it does not yet &s;hew it&s;elf. But I tru&s;t to your experience in ca&s;es of this nature to di&s;cover what he is fit for, and to in&s;truct him accord|ingly. I beg to be favoured &s;hortly with your opinion about him, and re|main, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, HUMPHRY ACRES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When Mr. Wi&s;eman had read his letter, he &s;hook his head, and &s;aid to his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, A pretty &s;ubject they have &s;ent us here! a lad that has a great ge|nius for nothing at all. But perhaps my friend Mr. Acres expects that a boy &s;hould &s;how a genius for a thing before he knows any thing about it&mdash;no un|common error! Let us &s;ee, however,
<PB N="48" REF="51">
what the youth looks like. I &s;uppo&s;e he is a human creature, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Samuel Acres was now call|ed in. He came hanging down his head, and looking as if he was going to be flogged.</P>
<P>Come hither, my dear! &s;aid Mr. Wi&s;eman&mdash;Stand by me, and do not be afraid. Nobody will hurt you. How old are you?</P>
<P>Eleven la&s;t May, Sir.</P>
<P>A well-grown boy of your age, in|deed. You love play, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<P>What, are you a good hand at mar|bles?</P>
<P>Pretty good, Sir.</P>
<P>And can &s;pin a top, and drive a hoop, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<P>Then you have the full u&s;e of your hands and fingers?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
Can you write, Samuel?</P>
<P>I learned a little, Sir, but I left it off again.</P>
<P>And why &s;o?</P>

<P>No! Why how do you think other boys do?&mdash;have they more fingers than you?</P>
<P>No, Sir.</P>

<P>Samuel was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Let me look at your hand.</P>
<P>Samuel held out both his paws, like a dancing bear.</P>
<P>I &s;ee nothing here to hinder you from writing as well as any boy in the &s;chool. You can read, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;taking more pains will enable you to read better. Do you know any thing of the Latin grammar?</P>
<P>No, Sir.</P>
<P>Have you never learned it?</P>
<P>I tried, Sir, but I could not get it by heart.</P>
<P>Why, you can &s;ay &s;ome things by heart. I dare &s;ay you can tell me the names of the days of the week in their order.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, I know them.</P>
<P>And the months in the year, perhaps.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<P>And you could probably repeat the names of your brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and all your father's &s;ervants, and half the people in the village be&s;ides.</P>
<P>I believe I could, Sir.</P>

<P>I could not do it, Sir.</P>
<P>How many marbles can you buy for a penny?</P>
<P>Twelve new ones, Sir.</P>
<P>And how many for a halfpenny?</P>
<P>Six.</P>

<P>Twenty-four.</P>
<P>If you were to have a penny a day, what would that make in a week?</P>
<P>Seven-pence.</P>
<P>But if you paid two-pence out of that, what would you have left?</P>
<P>Samuel &s;tudied awhile, and then &s;aid, five-pence.</P>
<P>Right. Why here you have been practi&s;ing the four great rules of arith|metic,
<PB N="52" REF="57">
addition, &s;ubtraction, multipli|cation, and divi&s;ion. Learning ac|counts is no more than this. Well, Samuel, I &s;ee what you are fit for. I &s;hall &s;et you about nothing but what you are able to do; but ob&s;erve, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do it. We have no <HI>I can't</HI> here. Now go among your &s;choolfellows.</P>
<P>Samuel went away, glad that his ex|amination was over, and with more con|fidence in his powers than he had felt before.</P>
<P>The next day he began bu&s;ine&s;s. A boy le&s;s than him&s;elf was called out to &s;et him a copy of letters, and another was appointed to hear him grammar. He read a few &s;entences in Engli&s;h that he could perfectly under&s;tand, to the ma&s;ter him&s;elf. Thus by going on &s;teadily and &s;lowly, he made a &s;en&s;ible progre&s;s. He had already joined his letters, got all the declen&s;ions perfect|ly, and half the multiplication table,

when Mr. Wi&s;eman thought it time to an&s;wer his father's letter; which he did as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I now think it right to give you &s;ome information concerning your &s;on. You perhaps expected it &s;ooner, but I always wi&s;h to avoid ha&s;ty judg|ments. You mentioned in your letter that it had not yet been di&s;covered which way his genius pointed. If by <HI>genius</HI> you meant &s;uch a decided bent of mind to any one pur&s;uit as will lead to excel with little or no labour or in&s;truction, I mu&s;t &s;ay that I have not met with &s;uch a quality in more than three or four boys in my life, and your &s;on is certainly not among the number. But if you mean only the <HI>ability</HI> to do &s;ome of tho&s;e things which the greater part of man|kind can do when properly taught, I can affirm that I find in him no peculiar deficiency. And whether you choo&s;e to bring him up to trade or to &s;ome

practical profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to doubt that he may in time become &s;uf|ficiently qualified for it. It is my fa|vourite maxim, Sir, that every thing mo&s;t valuable in this life may generally be acquired by taking pains for it. Your &s;on has already lo&s;t much time in the fruitle&s;s expectation of finding out what he would take up of his own accord. Believe me, Sir, few boys will take up any thing of their own accord but a top or a marble. I will take care while he is with me that he lo&s;es no more time this way, but is employed about things that are fit for him, not doubting that we &s;hall find him fit for them.</P>

<P>Though the doctrine of this letter did not perfectly agree with Mr. Acres's notions, yet being convinced that Mr. Wi&s;eman was more likely to make &s;omething of his &s;on than any of his

former preceptors, he continued him at this &s;chool for &s;ome years, and had the &s;atisfaction to find him going on in a &s;teady cour&s;e of gradual improvement.

<HEAD>HALF-A-CROWN'S WORTH.</HEAD>
<P>VALENTINE was in his thirteenth year, and a &s;cholar in one of our great &s;chools. He was a well-di&s;po&s;ed boy, but could not help envying a little &s;ome of his companions who had a larger al|lowance of money than him&s;elf. He ventured in a letter to &s;ound his father on the &s;ubject, not directly a&s;king for
<PB N="56" REF="61">
a particular &s;um, but mentioning that many of the boys in his cla&s;s had half-a-crown a week for pocket-money.</P>
<P>His father, who did not choo&s;e to comply with his wi&s;hes for various rea|&s;ons, nor yet to refu&s;e him in a mortify|ing manner, wrote an an&s;wer, the chief purpo&s;e of which was to make him &s;en|&s;ible what &s;ort of a &s;um half-a-crown a week was, and to how many more im|portant u&s;es it might be put, than to provide a &s;chool-boy with things ab&s;o|lutely &s;uperfluous to him.</P>
<P>It is calculated (&s;aid he) that a grown man may be kept in health and fit for la|bour upon a pound and a half of good bread a day. Suppo&s;e the value of this to be two-pence halfpenny, and add a penny for a quart of milk, which will greatly improve his diet. Half-a-crown will keep him eight or nine days in this manner.</P>
<P>A common labourer's wages in our county are &s;even &s;hillings per week,
<PB N="57" REF="62">
and if you add &s;omewhat extraordinary for harve&s;t work, this will not make it amount to three half-crowns on an aver|age the year round. Suppo&s;e his wife and children to earn another half-crown. For this ten &s;hillings per week he will maintain him&s;elf, his wife, and half-a-dozen children, in food, lodging, clothes, and fuel. A half-crown, then, may be reckoned the full weekly maintenance of two human creatures in every thing nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Where potatoes are much cultivated, two bu&s;hels, weighing eighty pounds a piece, may be purcha&s;ed for half-a-crown. Here is one hundred and &s;ixty pounds of &s;olid food, of which, allow|ing for the wa&s;te in dre&s;&s;ing, you may reckon two pounds and a half &s;ufficient for the &s;ole daily nouri&s;hment of one per&s;on. At this rate, nine people might be fed a week for half-a-crown; poorly in|deed, but &s;o as many thou&s;ands are fed,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
with the addition of a little &s;alt or but|termilk.</P>
<P>If the father of a numerous family were out of work, or the mother lying|in, a pari&s;h would think half-a-crown a week a very ample a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them.</P>
<P>Many of the cottagers round us would receive with great thankfulne&s;s a &s;ix|penny loaf per week, and reckon it a very material addition to their children's bread. For half-a-crown, therefore, you might purcha&s;e&mdash;the weekly ble&s;&s;|ings of five poor families.</P>
<P>Porter is a &s;ort of luxury to a poor man, but not an u&s;ele&s;s one, &s;ince it will &s;tand in the place of &s;ome &s;olid food, and enable him to work with better heart. You could treat a hard-work|ing man with a quart a day of this li|quor for a fortnight, with half-a-crown.</P>
<P>Many a cottage in the country inha|bited by a large family is let for forty &s;hillings a year. Half-a-crown a week
<PB N="59" REF="64">
would pay the full rent of three &s;uch cottages, and allow &s;omewhat over for repairs.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual price for &s;chooling at a dame-&s;chool in a village is two-pence a week. You might therefore get fifteen children in&s;tructed in reading and the girls in &s;ewing, for half-a-crown week|ly. But even in a town you might get them taught reading, writing, and ac|counts, and &s;o fitted for any common trade, for five &s;hillings a quarter; and therefore half-a-crown a week would keep &s;ix children at &s;uch a &s;chool, and provide them with books be&s;ides.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are ways in which half-a-crown a week might be made to do a great deal of good to <HI>others.</HI> I &s;hall now ju&s;t mention one or two ways of laying it out with advantage to your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I know you are very fond of colour|ed plates of plants, and other objects of natural hi&s;tory. There are now &s;everal
<PB N="60" REF="65">
works of this &s;ort publi&s;hing in monthly numbers, as the Botanical Magazine, the Engli&s;h Botany, the Flora Ru&s;tica, and the Naturali&s;t's Magazine. Now half-a-crown a week would reach the purcha&s;e of all the be&s;t of the&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;um laid out in the old book &s;hops in London would buy you more cla&s;&s;ics, and pretty editions too, in one year, than you could read in five.</P>
<P>Now I do not grudge laying out half-a-crown a week upon you; but when &s;o many good things for your&s;elf and others may be done with it, I am un|willing you &s;hould &s;quander it away like your &s;choolfellows in tarts and trinkets.</P>

<HEAD>THE RAT WITH A BELL,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>A large old hou&s;e in the country was &s;o extremely infe&s;ted with rats, that no|thing
<PB N="61" REF="66">
could be &s;ecured from their de|predations. They &s;caled the walls to attack flitches of bacon, though hung as high as the ceiling. Hanging-&s;helves afforded no protection to the chee&s;e and pa&s;try. They penetrated by &s;ap into the &s;tore-room, and plundered it of pre&s;erves and &s;weetmeats. They gnaw|ed through cupboard doors, undermin|ed floors, and ran races behind the wain&s;cots. The cats could not get at them: they were too cunning and too well fed to meddle with poi&s;on; and traps only now and then caught a heed|le&s;s &s;traggler. One of the&s;e, however, on being taken, was the occa&s;ion of practi&s;ing a new device. This was, to fa&s;ten a collar with a &s;mall bell about the pri&s;oner's neck, and then turn him loo&s;e again.</P>
<P>Overjoyed at the recovery of his li|berty, the rat ran into the neare&s;t hole, and went in &s;earch of his companions. They heard at a di&s;tance the bell tinkle,
<PB N="62" REF="67">
tinkle, through the dark pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome enemy had got among them, away they &s;coured, &s;ome one way and &s;ome another. The bell-bearer pur&s;ued; and &s;oon gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of their flight, he was greatly amu&s;ed by it. Wherever he approached, it was all hurry-&s;curry, and not a tail of one of them was to be &s;een. He cha&s;|ed his old friends from hole to hole, and room to room, laughing all the while at their fears, and increa&s;ing them by all the means in his power. Pre&s;ently he had the whole hou&s;e to him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"That's right (quoth he)&mdash;the fewer, the better cheer."</Q> So he rioted alone among the good things, and &s;tuffed till he could hardly walk.</P>
<P>For two or three days this cour&s;e of life went on very plea&s;antly. He eat, and eat, and played the bugbear to per|fection. At length he grew tired of this lonely condition, and longed to mix with his companions again upon
<PB N="63" REF="68">
the former footing. But the difficulty was, how to get rid of his bell. He pulled and tugged with his fore-feet, and almo&s;t wore the &s;kin off his neck in the attempt, but all in vain. The bell was now his plague and torment. He wandered from room to room, ear|ne&s;tly de&s;iring to make him&s;elf known to one of his companions, but they all kept out of his reach. At la&s;t, as he was moping about di&s;con&s;olate, he fell in pu&s;s's way, and was devoured in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>He who is rai&s;ed &s;o much above his fellow creatures as to be the object of their terror, mu&s;t &s;uffer for it in lo&s;ing all the comforts of &s;ociety. He is a &s;o|litary being in the mid&s;t of crowds. He keeps them at a di&s;tance, and they equally &s;hun him. Dread and affection cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t together.</P>

<HEAD>THIRTEENTH EVENING.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TRIAL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was meant as a &s;equel of that very plea&s;ing and ingenious little work, entitled <HI>Ju|venile Trials,</HI> in which a court of ju&s;tice is &s;up|po&s;ed to be in&s;tituted in a boarding-&s;chool, com|po&s;ed of the &s;cholars them&s;elves, for the pur|po&s;e of trying offences committed at &s;chool.</NOTE></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Complaint made again&s;t &s;undry Per&s;ons for break|ing the Windows of DOROTHY CAREFUL, Widow, and Dealer in Gingerbread.</HEAD>
<P>THE court being &s;at, there appeared in per&s;on the Widow <HI>Dorothy Careful,</HI> to make a complaint again&s;t <HI>Henry Luckle&s;s,</HI> and other per&s;on or per&s;ons unknown, for breaking three panes of gla&s;s, value ninepence, in the hou&s;e of the &s;aid widow. Being directed to tell her ca&s;e to the court, &s;he made a curt|&s;ey, and began as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Plea&s;e your lord&s;hip, I was &s;itting
<PB N="65" REF="70">
at work by my fire&s;ide, between the hours of &s;ix and &s;even in the evening, ju&s;t as it was growing du&s;k, and little Jack was &s;pinning be&s;ide me, when all at once crack went the window, and down fell a little ba&s;ket of cakes that was &s;et up again&s;t it. I &s;tarted up, and cried to Jack, Ble&s;s me, what's the matter! So &s;ays Jack, Somebody has thrown a &s;tone and broke the window, and I dare &s;ay it is &s;ome of the &s;chool|boys. With that I ran out of the hou&s;e, and &s;aw &s;ome boys making off as fa&s;t as they could go. So I ran after them as quick as my old legs would carry me; but I &s;hould never have come near them, if one had not happened to fall down. Him I caught, and brought back to my hou&s;e; when Jack knew him at once to be Ma&s;ter Harry Luck|le&s;s. So I told him I would complain of him the next day; and I hope your wor&s;hip will make him pay the damage, and I think he de&s;erves a good whip|ping
<PB N="66" REF="71">
into the bargain, for injuring a poor widow woman."</Q></P>
<P>The Judge having heard Mrs. Care|ful's &s;tory, de&s;ired her to &s;it down: and then, calling up Ma&s;ter Luckle&s;s, a&s;ked him what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf. Luckle&s;s appeared with his face a good deal &s;cratched, and looking very rue|fully. After making his bow, and &s;obbing two or three times, he &s;aid:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My lord, I am as innocent of this matter as any boy in the &s;chool, and I am &s;ure I have &s;uffered enough about it already. My lord, Billy Thomp&s;on and I were playing in the lane near Mrs. Careful's hou&s;e, when we heard the window cra&s;h; and directly after, &s;he came running out towards us. Up|on this, Billy ran away, and I ran too, thinking I might bear the blame. But after running a little way, I &s;tumbled over &s;omething that lay in the road, and before I could get up again, &s;he overtook me, and caught me by the
<PB N="67" REF="72">
hair, and began lugging and cuffing me. I told her it was not I that broke her window, but it did not &s;ignify; &s;o &s;he dragged me to the light, lugging and &s;cratching me all the while, and then &s;aid &s;he would inform again&s;t me; and that is all I know of the matter."</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, good woman, you were willing to revenge your&s;elf, without waiting for the ju&s;tice of this court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow Careful.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I confe&s;s I was put into a pa&s;&s;ion, and did not properly con&s;ider what I was doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, where is Billy Thomp|&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard what Harry Luckle&s;s &s;ays. Declare, upon your ho|nour, whether he has &s;poken the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I am &s;ure neither he, nor I, had any concern in breaking the windows. We were &s;tanding together at the time, and I ran on hearing the door open, for fear of being charged
<PB N="68" REF="73">
with it, and he followed. But what became of him, I did not &s;tay to &s;ee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you let your friend &s;hift for him&s;elf, and only thought of &s;aving your&s;elf. But did you &s;ee any other per&s;on about the hou&s;e, or in the lane?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I thought I heard &s;omebody on the other &s;ide of the hedge creeping along, a little before the win|dow was broken, but I &s;aw nobody.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear, good woman, what is alledged in behalf of the per&s;on you have accu&s;ed. Have you any other evidence again&s;t him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow Careful.</SPEAKER>
<P>One might be &s;ure that they would deny it, and tell lies for one another: but I hope I am not to be put off in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, mi&s;tre&s;s, that you give too much liberty to your tongue, and are guilty of as much in|ju&s;tice as that of which you complain. I &s;hould be &s;orry indeed, if the young gentlemen of this &s;chool de&s;erved
<PB N="69" REF="74">
the general character of liars. You will find among us, I hope, as ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of what is right and honourable, as among tho&s;e who are older; and our worthy ma&s;ter certainly would not per|mit us to try offences in this manner, if he thought us capable of bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s in each other's favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow Careful.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;k your lord&s;hip's pardon, I did not mean to offend; but it is a heavy lo&s;s for a poor woman, and though I did not catch the boy in the fact, he was the neare&s;t when it was done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>As that is no more than a &s;u&s;picion, and he has the po&s;itive evi|dence of his &s;chool-fellow in his fa|vour, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to convict him, con&s;i&s;tently with the rules of ju&s;|tice. Have you di&s;covered any other circum&s;tance that may point out the of|fender?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow Careful.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, next morn|ing Jack found on the floor this top,
<PB N="70" REF="75">
which I &s;uppo&s;e the window was broke with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hand it up.&mdash;Here, gentle|men of the jury, plea&s;e to examine it, and &s;ee if you can di&s;cover any thing of its owner.</P>

<P>Yes, and I am &s;ure I recol|lect Peter Riot's having ju&s;t &s;uch an one.</P>

<P>So do I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma&s;ter Riot, is this your top?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Riot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, my lord, per|haps it may be mine; I have had a great many tops, and when I have done with them, I throw them away, and any body may pick them up that plea&s;es. You &s;ee it has lo&s;t its peg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, &s;ir. Mrs. Care|ful, you may retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow Careful.</SPEAKER>
<P>And mu&s;t I have no amends, my lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience. Leave every thing to the court. We &s;hall do you
<PB N="71" REF="76">
all the ju&s;tice in our power. As &s;oon as the widow was gone, the Judge ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and with much &s;olemnity thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly:</P>
<P>Gentlemen,&mdash;this bu&s;ine&s;s, I confe&s;s, gives me much di&s;&s;atisfaction. A poor woman has been in&s;ulted, and injured in her property, apparently without pro|vocation; and though &s;he has not been able to convict the offender, it cannot be doubted that &s;he, as well as the world in general, will impute the crime to &s;ome of our &s;ociety. Though I am in my own mind convinced that in her pa&s;&s;ion &s;he charged an innocent per&s;on, yet the circum&s;tance of the top is a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, indeed almo&s;t a proof, that the perpetrator of this unmanly mi&s;chief was one of our body. The owner of the top has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that its having been his property is no cer|tain proof again&s;t him. Since, there|fore, in the pre&s;ent defect of evidence, the whole &s;chool mu&s;t remain burthen|ed
<PB N="72" REF="77">
with the di&s;credit of this action, and &s;hare in the guilt of it, I think fit, in the fir&s;t place, to decree, that re&s;titu|tion &s;hall be made to the &s;ufferer out of the public che&s;t; and next, that a court of enquiry be in&s;tituted, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of &s;earching thoroughly into this affair, with power to examine all per&s;ons upon honour, who are thought likely to be able to throw light upon it. I hope, gentlemen, the&s;e mea&s;ures meet with your concurrence!</P>
<P>The whole court bowed to the Judge, and expre&s;&s;ed their entire &s;atisfaction with his determination.</P>
<P>It was then ordered, that the public trea&s;urer &s;hould go to the Widow Care|ful's hou&s;e, and pay her the &s;um of one &s;hilling, making at the &s;ame time a hand&s;ome apology in the name of the &s;chool. And &s;ix per&s;ons were taken by lot out of the jury to compo&s;e the court of enquiry, which was to &s;it in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="78">
The court then adjourned.</P>
<P>On the meeting of the court of en|quiry, the fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed by the Pre&s;ident was, that the per&s;ons who u&s;ually played with Ma&s;ter Riot &s;hould be &s;ent for. Accordingly Tom Fri&s;k and Bob Loiter were &s;ummoned, when the Pre&s;ident a&s;ked them upon their honour if they knew the top to have been Riot's. They &s;aid they did. They were then a&s;ked whether they remembered when Riot had it in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fri&s;k.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had it the day before ye&s;|terday, and &s;plit a top of mine with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loiter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and then, as he was mak|ing a &s;troke at mine, the peg flew out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he then do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fri&s;k.</SPEAKER>
<P>He put it into his pocket, and &s;aid, as it was a &s;trong top, he would have it mended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he did not throw it away, or give it to any body?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="79">
<SPEAKER>Loiter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he pocketted it up, and we &s;aw no more of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know of any quarrel he had with Widow Careful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fri&s;k.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; a day or two before he went to her &s;hop for &s;ome gingerbread; but as he already owed her &s;ixpence, &s;he would not let him have any till he had paid his debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did he take this di&s;ap|pointment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fri&s;k.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;aid he would be revenged on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you &s;ure he u&s;ed &s;uch words?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fri&s;k.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Loiter heard him as well as my&s;elf.</P>

<P>I did, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do either of you know any more of this affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Both.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may go.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident now ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="75" REF="80">
the&s;e witne&s;&s;es had done a great deal in e&s;tabli&s;hing proofs again&s;t Riot; for it was now pretty certain that no one but him&s;elf could have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the top at the time the crime was com|mitted; and al&s;o it appeared, that he had declared a malicious intention again&s;t the woman, which it was highly proba|ble he would put in execution.&mdash;As the court was debating about the next &s;tep to be taken, they were acquainted that Jack, the widow's &s;on, was wait|ing at the &s;chool door for admi&s;&s;ion; and a per&s;on being &s;ent out for him, Riot was found threatening the boy, and bidding him go home about his bu&s;ine&s;s. The boy was however conveyed &s;afely into the room, when he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Pre&s;ident.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, an plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, as I was looking about this morning for &s;ticks in the hedge over again&s;t our hou&s;e, I found this buckle. So I thought to my&s;elf, &s;ure this mu&s;t be|long

<P>Very well, Gentlemen; we have nothing more to do, than to draw up an account of all the evidence we have heard, and lay it before his lord|&s;hip. Jack, you may go home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, let &s;omebody go with me, for I am afraid of Riot, who has ju&s;t been threatening me at the door.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pre&s;id.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma&s;ter Bold will plea&s;e to go along with the boy.</P>
<P>The minutes of the court were then drawn up, and the Pre&s;ident took them to the Judge's chamber. After the Judge had peru&s;ed them, he ordered an indictment to be drawn up again&s;t Peter Riot, <Q REND="inline">"for that he meanly, clande&s;tine|ly, and with malice afore-thought, had broken three panes in the window of Widow Careful, with a certain in&s;tru|ment called a top, whereby he had committed an atrocious injury on an innocent per&s;on, and had brought a di&s;|grace upon the &s;ociety to which he be|longed."</Q> At the &s;ame time, he &s;ent an officer to inform Ma&s;ter Riot that his trial would come on the next morning.</P>
<P>Riot, who was with &s;ome of his gay companions, affected to treat the mat|ter with great indifference, and even to make a je&s;t of it. However, in the morning he thought it be&s;t to endeavour to make it up; and accordingly, when
<PB N="78" REF="83">
the court was a&s;&s;embled, he &s;ent one of his friends with a &s;hilling, &s;aying that he would not trouble them with any further enquiries, but would pay the &s;um that had been i&s;&s;ued out of the public &s;tock. On the receipt of this me&s;&s;age, the Judge ro&s;e with much &s;everity in his countenance, and ob&s;erving, that by &s;uch a contemptuous behaviour towards the court the criminal had greatly added to his offence, he ordered two officers with their &s;taves immediately to go and bring in Riot, and to u&s;e force, if he &s;hould re|&s;i&s;t them. The culprit, thinking it be&s;t to &s;ubmit, was pre&s;ently led in between the two officers; when being placed at the bar, the Judge thus addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Sir, that any member of this &s;ociety can be &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of the nature of a crime, and &s;o little ac|quainted with the principles of a court of ju&s;tice, as you have &s;hewn your&s;elf to be, by the propo&s;al you took the improper liberty of &s;ending to us. If you meant
<PB N="79" REF="84">
it as a confe&s;&s;ion of your guilt, you cer|tainly ought to have waited to receive from us the penalty we thought proper to inflict, and not to have imagined that an offer of the mere payment of da|mages would &s;atisfy the claims of ju&s;|tice again&s;t you. If you had only broken the window by accident, and on your own accord offered re&s;titution, nothing le&s;s than the full damages could have been accepted. But you now &s;tand charged with having done this mi&s;chief, meanly, &s;ecretly, and mali|ciou&s;ly, and thereby have added a great deal of criminal intention to the act. Can you then think that a court like this, de&s;igned to watch over the morals, as well as protect the properties, of our community, can &s;o &s;lightly pa&s;s over &s;uch aggravated offences? You can claim no merit from confe&s;&s;ing the crime, now that you know &s;o much evidence will appear again&s;t you. And if you choo&s;e &s;till to plead not guilty, you

are at liberty to do it, and we will pro|ceed immediately to the trial, without taking any advantage of the confe&s;&s;ion implied by your offer of payment."</Q></P>
<P>Riot &s;tood &s;ilent for &s;ome time, and then begged to be allowed to con&s;ult with his friends, what was be&s;t for him to do. This was agreed to, and he was permitted to retire, though under guard of an officer. After a &s;hort ab&s;ence, he returned with more humility in his looks, and &s;aid that he pleaded guilty, and threw him&s;elf on the mercy of the court. The Judge then made a &s;peech of &s;ome length, for the purpo&s;e of con|vincing the pri&s;oner, as well as the by|&s;tanders, of the enormity of the crime. He then pronounced the following &s;en|tence:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, Peter Riot, are hereby &s;en|tenced to pay the &s;um of half a crown to the public trea&s;ury, as a &s;atisfaction for the mi&s;chief you have done, and your attempt to conceal it. You are
<PB N="81" REF="88">
to repair to the hou&s;e of Widow Careful, accompanied by &s;uch witne&s;&s;es as we &s;hall appoint, and there, having fir&s;t paid her the &s;um you owe her, you &s;hall a&s;k her pardon for the in&s;ult you offered her. You &s;hall likewi&s;e, to|morrow, after &s;chool, &s;tand up in your place, and before all the &s;cholars a&s;k pardon for the di&s;grace you have been the means of bringing upon the &s;ociety; and in particular, you &s;hall apologize to Ma&s;ter Luckle&s;s, for the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance you were the means of bringing him into. Till all this is com|plied with, you &s;hall not pre&s;ume to come into the play ground, or join in any of the diver&s;ions of the &s;chool; and all per&s;ons are hereby admoni&s;hed not to keep you company till this is done."</Q></P>
<P>Riot was then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his room; and in the afternoon he was taken to the widow's, who was plea&s;ed to receive his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion graciou&s;ly, and at the &s;ame time to apologize for her own im|proper

<P>In &s;ome kinds, however, it is di|vided in the middle, and &s;o is like a boat &s;plit in two. All the&s;e parts have claws which unite to form a tube, &s;et in a <HI>calyx</HI> or flower cup. This tube, you ob&s;erve, is longer in the bean than in the pea, and the proportions of the other parts are &s;omewhat different; but the parts them&s;elves are found in both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they are. I think them alike now.</P>

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the con&s;equence of ex|amining clo&s;ely. Now let us &s;trip off

all the leaves of this bean flower but the keel. What do you think this boat contains?</P>

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. I will draw down the keel gently, and you &s;hall &s;ee them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>How curious!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here are a number of chives join|ing in their bodies &s;o as to make a round tube, or cylinder, through which comes out a crooked thread, which is the pi&s;til. I will now with a pin &s;lit this cylinder. What do you &s;ee within it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Somewhat like a little pod.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;and to &s;how you that it <HI>is</HI> a pod, I will open it, and you &s;hall &s;ee the &s;eeds within it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What tiny things! Is this then what makes the bean-pod afterwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. When the blo&s;&s;om drops, this &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el grows bigger and bigger,
<PB N="86" REF="93">
and at length hardens as the &s;eeds grow ripe, becomes black and &s;hriveled, and would bur&s;t and &s;hed the &s;eeds, if they were not gathered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal bur&s;t pods of our &s;weet-peas under the wall, with no|thing left in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is common for the field peas and beans to lo&s;e a great part of the &s;eeds while they are getting in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the bottom of this pea-&s;talk there are &s;ome pods &s;et already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Open one. You &s;ee that the pod is compo&s;ed of two &s;hells, and that all the &s;eeds are fa&s;tened to one &s;ide of the pod, but alternately to each &s;hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it the &s;ame in beans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and in all other pods of the papilionaceous flowers. Well&mdash;this is the general &s;tructure of a very numer|ous and u&s;eful cla&s;s of plants called the <HI>leguminous,</HI> or <HI>podded.</HI> Of the&s;e, in this country, the greater part are herbaceous, with &s;ome &s;hrubs. In the warm cli|mates
<PB N="87" REF="94">
there are al&s;o tall trees. Many of the leguminous plants afford excel|lent nouri&s;hment for man and bea&s;t; and their pods have the name of <HI>pul&s;e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read of per&s;ons living on pul&s;e, but I did not know what it meant before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is frequently mentioned as part of the diet of ab&s;temious per&s;ons. Of this kind, we eat peas, beans, and kid|ney or French beans, of all which there are a variety of &s;orts cultivated. Other nations eat lentiles and lupins, which are of this cla&s;s; with &s;everal others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember our lupins in the garden have flowers of this kind, with pods growing in clu&s;ters. But we only cultivate them for the colour and &s;mell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>But other nations eat them. Then all the kinds of clover, or trefoil, which are &s;o u&s;eful in feeding cattle, belong to this tribe; as do likewi&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="95">
vetches, &s;ainfoin, and lucerne, which are u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The&s;e principally compo&s;e what are u&s;ually, though improperly, called in agriculture <HI>artificial gra&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clover flowers are as &s;weet as beans; but do they bear pods?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; very &s;hort ones, with one or two &s;eeds in each. But there is a kind called non&s;uch, with a very &s;mall yellow flower, that has a curious twi&s;ted pod, like a &s;nail-&s;hell. Many of the leguminous plants are weak, and cannot &s;upport them&s;elves; hence they are furni&s;hed with tendrils, by means of which they cla&s;p neighbouring plants, and run up them. You know the garden peas do &s;o to the &s;ticks which are &s;et in the rows with them. Some kinds of vetches run in this manner up the hedges, which they decorate with their long bunches of blue or purple flowers. Tares, which are &s;ome of the
<PB N="89" REF="96">
&s;lendere&s;t of the family, do much mi&s;|chief among corn by twining round it and choaking it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they good for, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are weeds, or noxious plants, with re&s;pect to us; but doubt|le&s;s they have their u&s;es in the creation. Some of our papilionaceous plants, however, are able enough to &s;hift for them&s;elves; for gor&s;e or furze is of the number.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, that prickly bu&s;h all covered over with yellow flowers, that over-runs our common?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Then there is broom, a plant as big, but without thorns, and with larger flowers. This is as fre|quent as furze in &s;ome places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it grows in abundance in the broom-field.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does; but the naming of fields and places from it is a proof that it is not &s;o common as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="97">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have &s;ome bu&s;hes of white broom in the &s;hrubbery, and &s;ome trees of Spani&s;h broom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. You have al&s;o a &s;mall tree which flowers early, and bears a great many pendent bunches of yellow blo&s;|&s;oms, that look peculiarly beautiful when intermixed with the purple lilacs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it&mdash;Laburnum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. That is one of our cla&s;s of plants too. Then there is a large tree, with delicate little leaves, protected by long thorns, and bearing bunches of white papilionaceous flowers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know which you mean, but I cannot tell the name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Ba&s;tard Acacia, or Lo|cu&s;t tree, a native of America. Thus, you &s;ee, we have traced this cla&s;s of plants through all &s;izes, from the tre|foil that covers the turf, to a large tree. I &s;hould not, however, forget two others, the Liquorice and the Tama|rind. The Liquorice, with the &s;weet
<PB N="91" REF="98">
root of which you are well acquainted, grows in the warmer countries, e&s;pe|cially Spain, but is cultivated in Eng|land. The Tamarind is a large &s;pread|ing tree growing in the We&s;t Indies, and valued for its &s;hade, as well as for the cooling acid pulp of its pods, which are pre&s;erved with &s;ugar and &s;ent over to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know them very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;do you think now you &s;hall both be able to di&s;cover a papilio|naceous flower when you meet with it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I &s;hall, if they are all like the&s;e we have been examining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have all the &s;ame parts, though variou&s;ly proportioned. What are the&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is the &s;tandard and two wings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the keel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right&mdash;the keel &s;ometimes cleft into two, and then it is an irregular five-leaved
<PB N="92" REF="99">
flower. The chives are gene|rally ten, of which one &s;tands apart from the re&s;t. The pi&s;til &s;ingle, and ending in a pod. Another circum&s;tance com|mon to mo&s;t of this tribe, is that their leaves are <HI>winged</HI> or <HI>pinnated,</HI> that is, having leaflets &s;et oppo&s;ite each other upon a middle rib. You &s;ee this &s;truc|ture in the&s;e bean leaves. But in the clovers there are only two oppo&s;ite leaf|lets, and one terminating; whence their name of trefoil, or three-leaf. What we call a club on cards is properly a clover leaf, and the French call it <HI>trefle,</HI> which means the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think this tribe of plants almo&s;t as u&s;eful as the gra&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They perhaps come the next in utility; but their &s;eeds, &s;uch as beans and peas, are not quite &s;uch good nou|ri&s;hment as corn, and bread cannot be made of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But clover is better than gra&s;s for cattle.</P>

<P>In&s;tead of advancing &s;quare, &s;tiff, with arms &s;tuck out, every one who knows how to walk the &s;treets, glides along, his arms clo&s;e, his body oblique and flexible, his track gently winding, leaving now a few inches on this &s;ide, now on that, &s;o as to pa&s;s and be pa&s;&s;ed, without touching, in the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;pace.</P>

<P>It is that &s;teady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our&s;elves in ca&s;es of alarm, that pre|vents us from being flurried and frightened.

<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;the maid, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, &s;et up a great &s;cream, and ran out of the room; and Mary might have been burnt to death for any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;he could give her.</P>

<P>Yes&mdash;the girl had not the lea&s;t pre&s;ence of mind, and the con&s;e|quence was, depriving her of all re|collection, and making her entirely u&s;e|le&s;s. But as &s;oon as your aunt came
<PB N="101" REF="108">
up, &s;he took the right method for pre|venting the mi&s;chief. The cap was too much on fire to be pulled off; &s;o &s;he whipped a quilt from the bed and flung it round Mary's head, and thus &s;tifled the flame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mary was a good deal &s;corched, though.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes&mdash;but it was very well that it was no wor&s;e. If the maid, however, had acted with any &s;en&s;e at fir&s;t, no harm at all would have been done, except burning the cap. I re|member a much more fatal example of the want of pre&s;ence of mind. The mi&s;tre&s;s of a family was awakened by flames bur&s;ting through the wain&s;cot into her chamber. She flew to the &s;tair-ca&s;e; and in her confu&s;ion, in&s;tead of going up &s;tairs to call her children, who &s;lept together in the nur&s;ery over|head, and who might all have e&s;caped by the top of the hou&s;e, &s;he ran down, and with much danger made way
<PB N="102" REF="109">
through the fire into the &s;treet. When &s;he had got thither, the thought of her poor children ru&s;hed into her mind, but it was too late. The &s;tairs had caught fire, &s;o that nobody could get near them, and they were burned in their beds.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a &s;ad thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sad indeed! Now I will tell you of a different conduct. A lady was awakened by the crackling of fire, and &s;aw it &s;hining under her chamber floor. Her hu&s;band would immediately have opened the door, but &s;he pre|vented him, &s;ince the &s;moke and flame would then have bur&s;t in upon them. The children with a maid &s;lept in a room opening out of theirs. She went and awakened them; and tying together the &s;heets and blankets, &s;he &s;ent down the maid from the window fir&s;t, and then let down the children one by one to her. La&s;t of all &s;he de&s;cended her|&s;elf.

A few minutes after, the floor fell in, and all the hou&s;e was in flames.</P>

<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a happy e&s;cape!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;and with what cool recollection of mind it was managed! For mothers to love their children, and be willing to run any hazards for them, is common; but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent exertions in the time of danger. I knew a lady who had a fine little boy &s;itting in her lap. He put a whole plum into his mouth, which &s;lipped into his throat, and choaked him. The poor fellow turned black, and &s;truggled violently; and the mother was &s;o frightened, that in&s;tead of putting her finger into his throat and pulling out the plum, which might ea&s;ily have been done, &s;he laid him on the floor and ran to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

When one of the&s;e is cut, it bleeds very violently, and the only way to &s;top it is to make a pre&s;&s;ure between the wounded place and the heart in order to intercept the cour&s;e of the blood towards it. Well
<PB N="106" REF="113">
&mdash;this poor man bled profu&s;ely; and the people about him, both men and women, were &s;o &s;tupified with fright, that &s;ome ran one way, &s;ome another, and &s;ome &s;tood &s;tock &s;till. In &s;hort, he would &s;oon have bled to death, had not a bri&s;k &s;tout-hearted wench, who came up, &s;lipt off her garter, and bound it tight above the wound, by which means the bleeding was &s;topt till proper help could be procured.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had perhaps heard it, as you have done now; and &s;o proba|bly had &s;ome of the others, but they had not pre&s;ence of mind enough to put it in practice. It is a much greater trial of courage, however, when the danger pre&s;&s;es upon our&s;elves as well as others. Suppo&s;e a furious bull was to come upon you in the mid&s;t of a field. You could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape him by running, and attempting it
<PB N="107" REF="114">
would de&s;troy your only chance of &s;afety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a &s;tory for that too. The mother of that Mr. Day who wrote <HI>Sandford and Merton</HI> was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, as he al&s;o was, for courage and pre&s;ence of mind. When a young woman, &s;he was one day walking in the fields with a companion, when they perceived a bull coming to them, roar|ing and to&s;&s;ing about his horns in the mo&s;t tremendous manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, how I &s;hould have &s;creamed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare &s;ay you would; and &s;o did her companion. But &s;he bid her walk away behind her as gently as &s;he could, whil&s;t &s;he her&s;elf &s;topt &s;hort, and faced the bull, eyeing him with a determined countenance. The bull, when he had come near, &s;topt al&s;o, pawing the ground and roaring. Few animals will attack a man who &s;teadily waits for them. In a while, &s;he drew
<PB N="108" REF="115">
back &s;ome &s;teps, &s;till facing the bull. The bull followed. She &s;topt, and then he &s;topt. In this manner, &s;he made good her retreat to the &s;tile over which her companion had before got. She then turned and &s;prung over it, and got clear out of danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was bravely done, indeed! But I think very few women could have done as much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a degree of cool re&s;o|lution, to be &s;ure, is not common. But I have read of a lady in the Ea&s;t-Indies who &s;howed at lea&s;t as much. She was &s;itting out of doors with a party of plea|&s;ure, when they were aware of a huge tyger that had crept through a hedge near them, and was ju&s;t ready to make his fatal &s;pring. They were &s;truck with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation; but &s;he, with an umbrella in her hand, turned to the tyger, and &s;uddenly &s;pread it full in his face. This unu&s;ual a&s;&s;ault &s;o terrified the bea&s;t, that taking a prodigious
<PB N="109" REF="116">
leap, he &s;prung over the fence, and plunged out of &s;ight into the neigh|bouring thicket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;that was the bolde&s;t thing I ever heard of. But is it po&s;&s;ible, mamma, to make one&s;elf courage|ous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage, my dear, is of two kinds; one the gift of nature, the other of rea&s;on and habit. Men have naturally more courage than women; that is, they are le&s;s affected by danger; it makes a le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion upon them, and does not flutter their &s;pirits &s;o much. This is owing to the difference of their bodily con&s;titution; and from the &s;ame cau&s;e, &s;ome men and &s;ome women are more courageous than others. But the other kind of courage may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be acquired by every one. Rea&s;on teaches us to face &s;maller dangers in order to avoid greater, and even to undergo the greate&s;t when our duty requires it.
<PB N="110" REF="117">
Habit makes us le&s;s affected by parti|cular dangers which have often come in our way. A &s;ailor does not feel the danger of a &s;torm &s;o much as a land|man; but if he was mounted upon a &s;pirited hor&s;e in a fox-chace, he would probably be the mo&s;t timorous man in company. The courage of women is chiefly tried in dome&s;tic dangers. They are attendants on the &s;ick and dying; and they mu&s;t qualify them|&s;elves to go through many &s;cenes of terror in the&s;e &s;ituations, which would alarm the &s;toute&s;t-hearted man who was not accu&s;tomed to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard that women gene|rally bear pain and illne&s;s better than men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>

<P>I hope not. It was for that purpo&s;e I made you &s;tand by me. And I would have you always force your&s;elf to look on and give a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;es of this kind, however painful it may at fir&s;t be to you, that you may as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible gain that pre&s;ence of mind which ari&s;es from habit.</P>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the earth is no more animate than they are; &s;o how can it pull?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well objected! This will bring us to the point. Sir I&s;aac Newton after deep meditation di&s;covered that there was a law in nature called <HI>attrac|tion,</HI> by virtue of which every particle of matter, that is, every thing of which the world is compo&s;ed, draws towards it every other particle of matter, with a force proportioned to its &s;ize and di&s;|tance. Lay two marbles on the table. They have a tendency to come to|gether, and if there were nothing el&s;e in the world, they would come to|gether; but they are al&s;o attracted by the table, by the ground, and by every
<PB N="122" REF="129">
thing be&s;ides in the room; and the&s;e different attractions pull again&s;t each other. Now, the globe of the earth is a prodigious ma&s;s of matter, to which nothing near it can bear any compari|&s;on. It draws, therefore, with mighty force every thing within its reach, which is the cau&s;e of their falling; and this is called the <HI>gravitation</HI> of bodies, or what gives them <HI>weight.</HI> When I lift up any thing, I act contrary to this force, for which rea&s;on it &s;eems <HI>heavy</HI> to me; and the heavier, the more matter it contains, &s;ince that increa&s;es the attraction of the earth for it. Do you under&s;tand this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I do. It is like a load|&s;tone drawing a needle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;that is an attraction, but of a particular kind, only taking place between the magnet and iron. But gravitation, or the attraction of the earth, acts upon every thing alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="123" REF="130">
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is pulling you and me at this moment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why do not we &s;tick to the ground, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e as weare a live, we have a power of &s;elf-motion, which can to a certain degree overcome the attraction of the earth. But the rea&s;on you cannot jump a mile high as well as a foot, is this attraction, which brings you down again after the force of your jump is &s;pent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think then I begin to under|&s;tand what I have heard of people living on the other &s;ide of the world, I believe they are called <HI>Antipodes,</HI> who have their feet turned towards ours, and their heads in the air. I u&s;ed to wonder how it could be that they did not fall off; but I &s;uppo&s;e the earth pulls them to it.</P>

<HEAD>NATURE AND EDUCATION,</HEAD>

<P><HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Education</HI> were one day walking together through a nur&s;ery of trees. See, &s;ays <HI>Nature,</HI> how &s;traight and fine tho&s;e firs grow&mdash;that is my doing! But as to tho&s;e oaks, they are all crooked and &s;tunted: that, my good &s;i&s;ter, is your fault. You have planted them too clo&s;e, and not pruned them properly. Nay, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid <HI>Education,</HI> I am &s;ure I have taken all po&s;&s;ible pains about them; but you gave me bad acorns, &s;o how &s;hould they ever make fine trees?</P>
<P>The di&s;pute grew warm; and at length, in&s;tead of blaming one another for negligence, they began to boa&s;t of their own powers, and to challenge each other to a conte&s;t for the &s;uperiority. It was agreed that each &s;hould adopt a favourite, and rear it up in &s;pite of all
<PB N="127" REF="134">
the ill offices of her opponent. <HI>Nature</HI> fixed upon a vigorous young Weymouth Pine, the parent of which had grown to be the main-ma&s;t of a man of war. Do what you will to this plant, &s;aid &s;he to her &s;i&s;ter, I am re&s;olved to pu&s;h it up as &s;traight as an arrow. <HI>Education</HI> took under her care a crab-tree. This, &s;aid &s;he, I will rear to be at lea&s;t as valuable as your pine.</P>
<P>Both went to work. While <HI>Nature</HI> was feeding her pine with plenty of whole&s;ome juices, <HI>Education</HI> pa&s;&s;ed a &s;trong rope round its top, and pulling it downwards with all her force, fa&s;tened it to the trunk of a neighbouring oak. The pine laboured to a&s;cend, but not being able to &s;urmount the ob&s;tacle, it pu&s;hed out to one &s;ide, and pre&s;ently be|came bent like a bow. Still, &s;uch was its vigour, that its top, after de&s;cending as low as its branches, made a new &s;hoot upwards; but its beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s were quite de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135">
The crab-tree co&s;t <HI>Education</HI> a world of pains. She pruned and pruned, and endeavoured to bring it into &s;hape, but in vain. <HI>Nature</HI> thru&s;t out a bough this way, and a knot that way, and would not pu&s;h a &s;ingle leading &s;hoot upwards. The trunk was, indeed, kept tolerably &s;traight by con&s;tant efforts; but the head grew awry and ill-fa&s;hioned, and made a &s;crubby figure. At length, <HI>Education,</HI> de&s;pairing of making a &s;ightly plant of it, ingrafted the &s;tock with an apple, and brought it to bear tolerable fruit.</P>
<P>At the end of the experiment, the &s;i&s;ters met to compare their re&s;pective &s;ucce&s;s. Ah, &s;i&s;ter! (&s;aid <HI>Nature</HI>) I &s;ee it is in your power to &s;poil the be&s;t of my works.

<P>I don't know, but I &s;uppo&s;e it was only an excu&s;e. Then his pre|dece&s;&s;or had a park well &s;tocked with deer, and u&s;ed to make liberal pre&s;ents of veni&s;on to all his neighbours. But this frugal gentleman has &s;old them all off, and got a flock of &s;heep in&s;tead.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>In twenty in&s;tances. He had a hor&s;e upon &s;ale the other day to which I took a liking, and bid money for it. As &s;oon as he found I was about it, he &s;ent it off to a fair on the other &s;ide of the county. My wife, you know, is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of cultivating flowers. Riding lately by his grounds &s;he ob|&s;erved &s;omething new, and took a great longing for a root or cutting of it. My gardener mentioned her wi&s;h to his (contrary, I own, to my inclina|tion), and he told his ma&s;ter; but in|&s;tead of obliging her, he charged the gardener on no account to touch the plant. A little while ago I turned off a man for &s;aucy behaviour; but as he had lived many years with me, and was a very u&s;eful &s;ervant, I meant to take him again upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which I did not doubt would &s;oon happen. In&s;tead of that, he goes and offers him|&s;elf to my civil neighbour, who, with|out deigning to apply to me, even for

<HEAD>THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. L. was one morning riding by him&s;elf, when, di&s;mounting to gather a plant in the hedge, his hor&s;e got loo&s;e and galloped away before him. He followed, calling the hor&s;e by his name, which &s;topt, but on his approach &s;et off again. At length a little boy in a neighbouring field, &s;eeing the affair, ran acro&s;s where the road made a turn, and getting before the hor&s;e, took him by
<PB N="145" REF="152">
the bridle, and held him till his owner came up. Mr. L. looked at the boy, and admired his ruddy cheerful coun|tenance. Thank you, my good lad! (&s;aid he) you have caught my hor&s;e very cleverly. What &s;hall I give you for your trouble? (putting his hand into his pocket.)</P>

<HEAD>FLYING AND SWIMMING.</HEAD>
<P>How I wi&s;h I could fly! (cried Ro|bert, as he was gazing after his pigeons that were exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in a morning's flight.) How fine it mu&s;t be to &s;oar to &s;uch a height, and to da&s;h through the air with &s;o &s;wift a motion!</P>
<P>I doubt not (&s;aid his father) that the pigeons have great plea&s;ure in it; but we have our plea&s;ures too; and it is idle to indulge longings for things quite out of our power.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think it impo&s;&s;ible for men to learn to fly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do&mdash;for I &s;ee they are not fur|ni&s;hed by nature with organs requi&s;ite for the purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Might not artificial wings be contrived, &s;uch as Daedalus is &s;aid to have u&s;ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly they might; but the dif|ficulty would be to put them in motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="151" REF="158">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why could not a man move them, if they were fa&s;tened to his &s;houl|ders, as well as a bird?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e he has got arms to move, which the bird has not. The &s;ame or|gans which in quadrupeds are employed to move the fore legs, and in man, the arms, are &s;pent in birds on the mo|tion of the wings. Nay, the mu&s;cles, or bundles of fle&s;h, that move the wings, are proportionally much larger and &s;tronger than tho&s;e be&s;towed upon our arms: &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible, formed as we are, that we &s;hould u&s;e wings, were they made and fa&s;tened on with ever &s;o much art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But angels, and Cupids, and &s;uch things, are painted with wings; and I think they look very natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you they may appear &s;o; but an anatomi&s;t &s;ees them at once to be mon&s;ters, which could not really exi&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>God might have created winged men, however, if he had plea&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="152" REF="159">
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt; but they could not have had the &s;ame &s;hape that men have now. They would have been different creatures, &s;uch as it was not in his plan to make. But you that long to fly&mdash;con&s;ider if you have made u&s;e of all the faculties already given you! You want to &s;ubdue the element of air&mdash;what can you do with that of water? Can you &s;wim?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your companion John&s;on, I think, can &s;wim very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reflect, then, on the difference betwixt him and you. A boat over&s;ets with you both in a deep &s;tream. You plump at once to the bottom, and infal|libly lo&s;e your life. He ri&s;es like a cork, darts away with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, and reaches the &s;ide in perfect &s;afety. Both of you pur&s;ued by a bull, come to the &s;ide of a river. He jumps in and cro&s;&s;es it. You are drowned if you attempt
<PB N="153" REF="160">
it, and to&s;&s;ed by the bull if you do not. What an advantage he has over you! Yet you are furni&s;hed with exactly the &s;ame bodily powers that he is. How is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e he has been taught, and I have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;but it is an ea&s;y thing to learn, and requires no other in&s;truction than boys can give one another when they bathe together; &s;o that I wonder any body &s;hould neglect to acquire an art at once agreeable and u&s;eful. The Romans u&s;ed to &s;ay, by way of proverb, of a blockhead, <Q REND="inline">"He can neither read nor &s;wim."</Q> You may remember how Cae&s;ar was &s;aved at Alexandria by throwing him&s;elf into the &s;ea, and &s;wimming with one hand, while he held up his Commentaries with the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like very well to &s;wim, and I have often tried, but I always pop under water, and that daunts me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="154" REF="161">
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is that fear which prevents you from &s;ucceeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it as natural for man to &s;wim, as for other creatures? I have heard that the young of all other ani|mals &s;wim the fir&s;t time they are thrown into the water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do&mdash;they are without fear. In our climate the water is generally cold, and is early made an object of ter|ror. But in the hot countries, where bathing is one of the greate&s;t of plea|&s;ures, young children &s;wim &s;o early and well, that I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they take to it almo&s;t naturally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am re&s;olved to learn, and I will a&s;k John&s;on to take me with him to the river.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do; but let him find you a &s;afe place to begin at. I don't want you, however, to proceed &s;o cautiou&s;ly as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="155" REF="162">
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;pread him&s;elf out on a large table, and placing before him a ba&s;on of water with a frog in it, he &s;truck with his arms and legs as he ob&s;erved the animal do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did that teach him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;to &s;wim on dry land; but he never ventured him&s;elf in the water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I get corks or bladders?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; learn to depend on your own powers. It is a good le&s;&s;on in other things, as well as in &s;wimming. Learn|ing to &s;wim with corks, is like learning to con&s;true Latin with a tran&s;lation on the other &s;ide.

<P>A YOUNG girl, having fatigued her|&s;elf one hot day with running about the garden, &s;at her&s;elf down in a plea&s;ant arbour, where &s;he pre&s;ently fell a&s;leep. During her &s;lumber, two female figures pre&s;ented them&s;elves before her. One was loo&s;ely habited in a thin robe of pink with light green trimmings. Her &s;a&s;h of &s;ilver gauze flowed to the ground. Her fair hair fell in ringlets down her neck; and her head-dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of artificial flowers interwoven with feathers. She held in one hand a ball-ticket, and in the other a fancy|dre&s;s all covered with &s;pangles and knots of gay ribbon. She advanced &s;miling to the girl, and with a familiar air thus addre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="164">
My deare&s;t Meli&s;&s;a, I am a kind ge|nius who have watched you from your birth, and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand, till at length they have rendered you a companion worthy of me. See what I have brought you. This dre&s;s and this ticket will give you free acce&s;s to all the ravi&s;hing delights of my palace. With me you will pa&s;s your days in a perpetual round of ever|varying amu&s;ements. Like the gay butterfly, you will have no other bu&s;i|ne&s;s than to flutter from flower to flower, and &s;pread your charms before admiring &s;pectators. No re&s;traints, no toils, no dull ta&s;ks are to be found with|in my happy domains. All is plea&s;ure, life and good humour. Come then, my dear! Let me put you on this dre&s;s, which will make you quite enchanting; and away, away, with me!</P>

<P>My name, &s;aid &s;he, is DISSIPATION.</P>
<P>The other female then advanced. She was clothed in a clo&s;e habit of brown &s;tuff, &s;imply relieved with white. She wore her &s;mooth hair under a plain cap. Her whole per&s;on was perfectly neat and clean. Her look was &s;erious, but &s;atisfied; and her air was &s;taid and compo&s;ed. She held in one hand a di&s;taff; on the oppo&s;ite arm hung a work-ba&s;ket; and the girdle round her wa&s;te was garni&s;hed with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knit|ting needles, reels, and other imple|ments of female labour. A bunch of keys hung at her &s;ide. She thus ac|co&s;ted the &s;leeping girl.</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a, I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion of your mother; and I now offer my protection to you. I have no allure|ments to tempt you with like tho&s;e of

But in return, I will en&s;ure you con|tent, even &s;pirits, &s;elf-approbation, and the e&s;teem of all who thoroughly know you. If the&s;e offers appear to your young mind le&s;s inviting than tho&s;e of my rival, be a&s;&s;ured, however, that they are more real. She has promi&s;ed much more than &s;he can ever make good. Perpetual plea&s;ures are no more in the power of Di&s;&s;ipation, than of Vice or Folly, to be&s;tow. Her delights quickly pall, and are inevitably &s;uc|ceeded by languor and di&s;gu&s;t.
