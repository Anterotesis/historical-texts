<HEAD>LETTER I. <HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD <HI>to</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU de&s;ire me to be very parti|cular during my &s;tay at Bath, in giving you an account of the gallantries carried on at this celebrated theatre of plea&s;ure; as if there could be any thing in the cu&s;tomary round of amour &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to a man of &s;en&s;e; or, as if I had nothing in nature to do
<PB N="2" REF="10">
but to play the impertinent Argus upon all my acquaintance, merely to have the mighty plea&s;ure of writing ince&s;&s;antly to the wor&s;hipful Charles Melmoth, E&s;q.&mdash;and no other inclination, but to fea&s;t that philo&s;ophic &s;en&s;uali&s;t with &s;tories of contented cuckolds and perfidious lovers, together with the long li&s;t of romantic girls, who place the warmth of their con&s;titution to the account of de&s;tiny, and kindly cur&s;e the poor &s;tars when their Strephons become &s;urfeited.</P>
<P>Indeed, Charles, I have too much bu&s;ine&s;s on my own hands, to trouble my&s;elf with the affairs of other people&mdash;therefore, unle&s;s you are determined to be &s;atisfied with &s;uch ca&s;ual intrigues as I engage in my&s;elf&mdash;my corre&s;pond|ence will be &s;carcely worth reading to a fellow of your eternal curio&s;ity.&mdash;That this, however, may not di&s;pirit you too much, you may recollect what a propen&s;ity I have to be particular with
<PB N="3" REF="11">
every woman who is fool enough to admit of my familiarity;&mdash;therefore, in this precious &s;pot, as there is likeli|hood enough of employment, you may now and then, probably, receive &s;ome accounts &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to keep you from yawning in your great chair after dinner&mdash;a cu&s;tom which will at la&s;t make you &s;hare the fate of the famous Charles John&s;on, who, if we may credit Mr. Pope, fell an ab&s;olute martyr to obe&s;ity.</P>
<P>I was interrupted in my lettter by a card from lady Haver&s;ham, de&s;iring me to be at tea in the afternoon; and, inti|mating that there were &s;ome very hand|&s;ome young ladies to pa&s;s the evening with her: an inducement which, &s;he &s;aid, would &s;ecure her the plea&s;ure of my company; for &s;he ju&s;tly enough ob&s;erved, that the circum&s;tance of her being my &s;i&s;ter might render me other|wi&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="12">
indifferent about the invitation.&mdash;You know well enough, Melmoth, what pains I always take in the decoration of my out&s;ide; and you have a thou&s;and times &s;worn that I am the mo&s;t egre|gious coxcomb in the kingdom.&mdash;Per|haps I am&mdash;and yet, between our&s;elves, I have always found this coxcombry of infinite &s;ervice, not only among the women, but among the very men, highly &s;oever as the generality of them &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e an attention to the elegance of externals: how often have I chuckled, when you and I walked together in the &s;treets, (you in a ru&s;ty black frock, and I perhaps in a magnificent &s;uit of em|broidery) to &s;ee, notwith&s;tanding all your contempt of dre&s;s, with what an uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity you kept hold of my arm, and endeavoured, upon the merit of your companion's coat, to be thought a man of con&s;equence by the vulgar&mdash;In proportion to the &s;habbine&s;s of your
<PB N="5" REF="13">
own appearance, you thought your&s;elf obliged to make a benefit of mine; and, how frequently have you &s;welled up with an air of the mo&s;t con&s;cious im|portance, when &s;ome &s;hopkeeper has ob|&s;erved, with an audible voice, that there was no doubt, for all the ru&s;tine&s;s of your coat, but what you were &s;omebody, or you would never be &s;o familiar with &s;o well dre&s;t a gentleman&mdash;Ah Melmoth, Mel|moth, you philo&s;ophers are actuated as much by vanity as the mo&s;t mincing fop|ling in the univer&s;e&mdash;Your very contempt of appearance is the ab&s;olute re&s;ult of your pride, tho' you would willingly put it down as the con&s;equence of your &s;en&s;e or the effect of your humility; and I am per|fectly &s;atisfied that Diogenes in his tub was fifty times a greater coxcomb than Alexander, though the puppy ridiculou&s;ly affected to look down on the conqueror of the world, and mi&s;took for an exalted emanation of &s;oul what was nothing but
<PB N="6" REF="14">
a de&s;picable &s;ally of impertinence.&mdash;All this, Charles, you will po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay is very true, but at the &s;ame time I am rather apprehen&s;ive you will tell me it is very dull al&s;o.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore con&s;ult your amu&s;ement in preference to your in&s;truction, and for once &s;uffer &s;ober &s;en|timent to make room for flim&s;ey narra|tive.</P>
<P>Well then, about &s;even o'clock I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a very elegant &s;uit of blue velvet embroidered with &s;ilver, and went in a chair to my &s;i&s;ter Haver|&s;ham's; where I found a large company of both &s;exes; and, in ju&s;tice to the in|timation contained in her card, I mu&s;t acknowledge that I never &s;aw a group of hand&s;omer women in my life&mdash;One in particular engaged my utmo&s;t atten|tion, whom I &s;oon found to be LOUISA MILDMAY, of Oxford&s;hire,&mdash;the cele|brated toa&s;t, who, though no more than
<PB N="7" REF="15">
twenty-one, has made the whole county a thou&s;and times drunk; and occa&s;ioned four duels, in which two hot-headed blockheads were actually killed, and a third &s;o di&s;abled, by a wound in his hip, as to be doomed for life to crutches and repentance.</P>
<P>As I had often heard of this young lady's beauty, and was moreover told that &s;he affected an in&s;en&s;ibility to the mo&s;t engaging efforts of gallantry; I re&s;olved to exert my utmo&s;t abili|ties in hopes of making &s;ome little impre&s;&s;ion on her bo&s;om; as I con&s;i|dered that it would greatly add to my character among the women if I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed with one, who was looked upon by both &s;exes with an equal mixture of envy and admiration.&mdash;Actuated by this motive, my bu&s;ine&s;s was to work upon her pride without exciting her re&s;entment; and to &s;hew
<PB N="8" REF="16">
that, irre&s;i&s;tible as &s;he had hitherto proved, there was one man who could neverthele&s;s behold her with indifference.&mdash;I therefore behaved to her with all the politene&s;s of the mo&s;t di&s;tant civi|lity, while I &s;ung, chatted, and romped with little Harriot Townly; and paid, in &s;hort, a much greater degree of at|tention to every other woman in the room.&mdash;The women, all highly delight|ed with the preference which was thus given them by a well dre&s;t young fellow, with a title and a large e&s;tate, in a manner devoured me; Harriot Townly in particular hung about me the whole evening; and, had it not been for the regard which I entertain for her brother, I do not know how far I might be tempted to carry my civilities.</P>
<P>As I was by much the be&s;t dre&s;t, and, without any compliment to my&s;elf, by much the likelie&s;t, fellow in the
<PB N="9" REF="17">
room, Loui&s;a could not &s;ee this palpable neglect of her beauty without the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible mortification; accu&s;tomed to be wor&s;hiped as a kind of divinity where|ever &s;he appeared, it was a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing circum&s;tance to find her inferiors in beauty treated with a preferable degree of re&s;pect; and, probably, &s;uppo&s;ing that I &s;hould have fallen an in&s;tant con|que&s;t, like a number of others, the di&s;|appointment doubled her chagrin; and I could ea&s;ily perceive that &s;he ca&s;t &s;everal glances of a mingled anger and con|tempt at your poor friend, as if &s;he equally &s;aw through my purpo&s;e and de&s;pi&s;ed it.&mdash;Be this however as it may, I retired early to give the ladies an op|portutunity of talking about me; and the next morning went to breakfa&s;t at lady Haver&s;ham's, on purpo&s;e to hear from my &s;i&s;ter, what was &s;aid after my departure the preceding evening.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18">Being &s;hewn up, who &s;hould I &s;ee, to my very great &s;urprize, at the tea|table, but Mi&s;s Loui&s;a&mdash;&s;he was alone with my &s;i&s;ter, and &s;eemed &s;omewhat confu&s;ed at my appearance; all this, you know, had a very good &s;ign, and gave me an additional cau&s;e to pur&s;ue a plan of operation which already wore &s;o probable a face of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;I therefore bowed with the colde&s;t air of re|&s;pect, and, with an inattention not alto|gether the mo&s;t mannerly, entered in|to &s;ome trifling di&s;cour&s;e with my &s;i&s;ter, &s;carcely ever opening my lips to Loui&s;a; though &s;he kindly encouraged me, by &s;ome occa&s;ional &s;miles at what I &s;aid, to make her a party in the conver|&s;ation.&mdash;Gue&s;&s;ing pretty clearly that, if I took my leave, I &s;hould have &s;omething worth li&s;tening to in the afternoon, I wi&s;hed the women a good morning, and went away with telling lady Haver&s;ham,
<PB N="11" REF="19">
that I &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly call in on her be|fore I went home to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>As you have heard &s;o much about Mi&s;s Mildmay, Charles, I &s;hall now proceed to do what I ought to have done &s;omewhat &s;ooner; that is, to give you a de&s;cription of her per&s;on, and an account of her family.&mdash;With regard to the fir&s;t, &s;he is to the full as tall as Mrs. Yates of Drury-lane theatre, and has a &s;en&s;ibility of countenance, which we hardly ever meet where features are &s;urprizingly regular&mdash;Her eyes are full, black, and langui&s;hing&mdash;her hair is as black as her eyes; and, from the pre&s;ent mode of dre&s;&s;ing, appears to &s;o much advantage, that, was &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no other per&s;onal attraction, it would be almo&s;t &s;ufficient to procure her a croud of admirers&mdash;Her forehead is finely open, and inconceivably white; and the two exqui&s;ite arches which are formed
<PB N="12" REF="20">
by her brows, give &s;uch a dignity to her looks, that none but an impudent fellow like my&s;elf could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee her with|out an in&s;tant veneration&mdash;As to her mouth, I never &s;aw any thing &s;o ravi&s;h|ing&mdash;The re&s;y ripene&s;s of the lips, while it captivates the eye, receives additional beauties from the delicious poutingne&s;s of their formation; &s;o that they ri&s;e with an equal charm both to the &s;ight and touch; and &s;eem no le&s;s calculated to excite emotion, than to reward it&mdash;Her teeth are remarkably even&mdash;but they have not that milky whitene&s;s which I have ob&s;erved in beauties of le&s;s eminence&mdash;They have to me, however, a colour which exceeds it&mdash;They have a certain pearline&s;s &s;o uncommonly clear, that you can in a manner &s;ee through them; and this I fancy is not only neare&s;t to the genuine ca&s;t of nature, but the be&s;t de&s;igned al&s;o for duration. Mi&s;s Loui&s;a is one of tho&s;e delightfully formed
<PB N="13" REF="21">
women, whom a Mu&s;&s;elman in a phren&s;y of devotion would &s;uppo&s;e to be a daughter of paradi&s;e&mdash;With the nice&s;t harmony of proportion, there is a vo|luptuous fle&s;hine&s;s through her per&s;on, which keeps the imagination continually on fire, and would kindle the bo&s;om of an anchorite into an in&s;tant flame of &s;en&s;uality. Some people, when they talk of beauties, prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e that a fine woman mu&s;t be &s;carcely fatter than the figure of Time over the mo|nument of general Hargrave&mdash;for my own part I am fond of &s;ome fle&s;h and blood about the bones Charles, and would even, of the two evils, rather pay my addre&s;&s;es to an Egyptian mummy than to an ab&s;olute &s;keleton. Mi&s;s Mildmay, however, &s;o far from &s;uffering the lea&s;t di&s;advantage through this ple|nitude of per&s;on, acquires new charms from it; it gives a maje&s;ty to her air which be&s;peaks your veneration; and
<PB N="14" REF="22">
blends all the elevation of dignity with all the tenderne&s;s of love.&mdash;Add to this, that there is a &s;omething in the very tone of her voice which indicates the woman of condition, and gives you a &s;uppo&s;ition of rank before you re|ceive the mo&s;t di&s;tant account of her family.</P>
<P>As to her family, it is not more antient than re&s;pectable&mdash;She reckons among her ance&s;tors on the father's &s;ide, the great Sir Philip Sidney; and her mother is de&s;cended from a branch of the immortal Hampden, who &s;o re&s;o|lutely oppo&s;ed the infamous oppre&s;&s;ions of that rapacious tyrant Charles the Fir&s;t.&mdash;Her father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, at pre&s;ent, a good four thou&s;and pounds a year; her only brother has a company in the guards, and is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed a very fine gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23">Notwith&s;tanding the advantages which Mi&s;s Mildmay derives from family and fortune, her education however has rather been ornamental than u&s;eful; and &s;he is much better calculated for her pre&s;ent character of a toa&s;t, than for the nece&s;&s;ary employment of mi&s;tre&s;s to a family&mdash;She &s;peaks French and Italian&mdash;plays on the harp&s;icord and the guittar; and &s;ings with an exqui&s;ite &s;hare of ta&s;te, though &s;he has le&s;s body to her voice, than you would imagine from the melody and fulne&s;s of her tones in common conver&s;ation.&mdash;The&s;e accom|pli&s;hments, neverthele&s;s, though they are generally as much as our young women of di&s;tinction po&s;&s;e&s;s now a days, are but very trifling matters when we come to enquire about a well informed mind, and a &s;tability of principle.&mdash;The men are not, in fact, &s;uch fools, my dear Melmoth, as the ladies may ima|gine; we love that they &s;hould under|&s;tand
<PB N="16" REF="24">
French and Italian; and we li&s;ten with plea&s;ure when they either &s;ing us a &s;ong, or favour us with a tune upon an in&s;trument.&mdash;Yet the&s;e are all but &s;econ|dary con&s;iderations:&mdash;After marriage, the ornamental parts of their education, like the beauties of their faces, very quickly le&s;&s;en in our e&s;teem&mdash;and nothing maintains its ground but &s;terling &s;en&s;e and real virtue.&mdash;A woman, therefore, who &s;tudies to be the univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, is rather a dangerous character for a wife&mdash;Compo&s;ed, in a great mea&s;ure, of affectation and levity, her principal &s;tudy is to plea&s;e tho&s;e who are labour|ing to de&s;troy her; and the only per&s;on whom &s;he declines to oblige is the un|fortunate poor devil who is continually &s;olicitous to promote her felicity.&mdash;For the&s;e rea&s;ons, when I marry, I &s;hall look out for a woman who&s;e mind has been improved in &s;ome proportion with her per&s;on&mdash;If mere externals were able to
<PB N="17" REF="25">
captivate me, I do not know a lady in the world whom I would &s;ooner think of than Mi&s;s Mildmay&mdash;But this rage for admiration, which I fear ab&s;orbs all her faculties, forbids me to entertain any thoughts of &s;ettling with her for life&mdash;I could by no means bear the imputation of imaginary infidelity in my wife; and Cae&s;ar him&s;elf could not be more delicate in this re&s;pect, when he &s;aid That it was not enough for his wife to be virtuous, &s;he mu&s;t be un&s;u&s;pected al&s;o.</P>
<P>When I look back upon the uncon|&s;cionable length of this letter&mdash;I wonder how I found inclination to write &s;o much; if, however, you find inclination to read it, I &s;hall not think my time mi&s;applied, &s;ince I am, dear Melmoth,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. <HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD, <HI>in Continuation to</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PURSUANT to the intention which I had intimated of calling in upon my &s;i&s;ter Haver&s;ham before dinner, I took but a turn or two round the rooms, and then went back to her hou&s;e, where I had the good fortune of finding her alone; a circum&s;tance which afforded me a proper opportunity of making the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries after Loui&s;a. As you know my &s;i&s;ter is a woman of great &s;entiment and delicacy, I was obliged to begin in a round|about manner, and therefore carele&s;sly ob&s;erved that we had a very agreeable party the preceding evening.</P>
<P><Q>Why Bob, &s;ays &s;he I &s;hould &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e that to be your real

opinion, by the hurry in which you took leave of the company&mdash;But pray what was the actual rea&s;on</Q>
(and here &s;he looked with a peculiar &s;ignificance of feature)
<Q>that robbed us &s;o early of a man devoted to the &s;ervice of the ladies&mdash;I was in hopes your com|plai&s;ance to them would have detained you a little longer, if you were in|fluenced by no regard for me&mdash;But I can gue&s;s&mdash;I know that con&s;um|mate vanity of your's too well not to think you were laying out &s;ome fre&s;h baits for the fooli&s;h women who honoured you with &s;o peculiar a di|&s;tinction&mdash;You wanted to give them an opportunity of talking about you after you were gone; and are now come to hear the whole &s;ub&s;tance of their conver&s;ation, from a &s;i&s;ter, who can keep nothing a &s;ecret from you, notwith&s;tanding &s;he is acquainted
<PB N="20" REF="28">
with the licentious turn of your di&s;|po&s;ition, and heartily laments it.</Q></P>
<P>"My dear lady Haver&s;ham," return|ed I,
<Q>how can you po&s;&s;ibly treat me with &s;o much &s;everity?&mdash;Bu&s;ine&s;s of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nature forced me from you la&s;t night; and this morn|ing, to convince you, that nothing but the re&s;ult of a brotherly affection induced me to call&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah, Bob, Bob," interrupted &s;he,
<Q>don't I know you?&mdash;Or, if I did not&mdash;the de&s;ign is too palpable to elude the eye of a common penetration.&mdash;But, be that as it may, what do you think of Loui&s;a Mildmay?</Q></P>
<P>"Think of her lady Haver&s;ham!&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Ay, think of her lady Haver&s;ham&mdash;Come, come, I &s;aw, under all that

de&s;truction, as well as of his own hap|pine&s;s, as the happine&s;s of other people&mdash;which might be rendered equally creditable to him&s;elf and advantageous to &s;ociety.&mdash;On this account, I have been, for &s;ome time, looking out for a woman who&s;e beauty might be able to &s;ecure your affection&mdash;who&s;e merit might be able to engage your e&s;teem; and who&s;e family might be able to give you an encrea&s;e of con&s;equence in your country.&mdash;The&s;e very de&s;irable requi&s;ites I find will be all an&s;wered in a union with Loui&s;a Mildmay&mdash;What &s;ay you then, my dear Bob&mdash;can you, for once, turn that fine &s;en&s;e of which I know you ma&s;ter, to the certain means of e&s;tabli&s;hing your real happine&s;s; or will you &s;till per&s;i&s;t, in oppo&s;ition both to your rea&s;on and your humanity, to pro&s;ecute &s;uch cour&s;es as you cannot view without

contempt, nor con&s;ider without de|te&s;tation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon my word lady Haver&s;ham,</Q> replied I <Q>you would make an admira|ble</Q>&mdash;"Come, come, Bob," returned &s;he,
<Q>don't endeavour to ridicule an argument which you are unable to an&s;wer; nor, by an untimely affectation of wit, attempt to le&s;&s;en the credit of your own under&s;tanding.&mdash;An&s;wer me therefore directly to the que&s;tion&mdash;What do you think of Mi&s;s Mild|may?</Q></P>
<P>I do not know how it was, Melmoth, but the good &s;en&s;e, and unaffected tenderne&s;s, of this amiable &s;i&s;ter, at that moment threw me off my guard&mdash;By the exertion of an irre&s;i&s;table frankne&s;s, &s;he rendered me as ingenuous as her&s;elf; and I candidly told her that I thought Loui&s;a one of the mo&s;t charming women
<PB N="24" REF="32">
I had ever &s;een; adding however, at the &s;ame time, that I fancied &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed rather too great a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own accompli&s;hments to think of do|me&s;ticating into the mi&s;tre&s;s of a fa|mily.</P>
<P>Lady Haver&s;ham to this replied, that I was entirely mi&s;taken&mdash;that Loui&s;a was at the bottom a woman of fine &s;en&s;e, and would make an admirable wife whenever &s;he altered her condition.&mdash;"I will not indeed," &s;ays lady Haver|&s;ham,
<Q>take upon me to &s;ay, that a young creature &s;o univer&s;ally admired can be entirely exempted from a little female vanity&mdash;You men are &s;trange contradictions; you are for ever en|deavouring to fill all the &s;illy girls of your acquaintance with a thou&s;and ri|diculous notions of their own beauty; and yet the moment you &s;ee this in|fiduous train of flattery take fire, you
<PB N="25" REF="33">
de&s;pi&s;e them for their vanity, with|out once good naturedly recollecting that this vanity is principally occa&s;ion|ed by your&s;elves&mdash;As to Mi&s;s Mild-may, if you have no other objection, I promi&s;e you there is but little to ap|prehend on this account&mdash;When her affections become once directed to a particular object, her fondne&s;s for ad|miration will naturally cea&s;e: &s;o that, with her regard for the man &s;he marries, joined to the &s;en&s;e which &s;he mu&s;t en|tertain of her duty, there can be no doubt but what &s;he will perform all the offices of a wife with the &s;tricte&s;t pro|priety: at lea&s;t this is my opinion of her, and I dare &s;ay you are convinced, that, unle&s;s &s;he &s;tood very high in my e&s;teem, I &s;hould not be &s;o earne&s;t in recommending her to your tendere&s;t con&s;ideration.</Q></P>
<P>From the &s;olicitude which my &s;i&s;ter di&s;covered in this affair, Charles, I was
<PB N="26" REF="34">
half inclined to think that the beautiful Loui&s;a was already actually &s;truck with my per&s;on and addre&s;s; and had in|&s;inuated &s;omething to my advantage during her vi&s;it in the morning. I there|fore dropt a di&s;tant hint of this nature, and, with an air half gay and half &s;erious, enquired of lady Haver&s;ham, whether &s;he thought there was any hope of Mi&s;s Mildmay's concurrence in ca&s;e a treaty &s;hould be opened between the two fa|milies.&mdash;To this lady Haver&s;ham re|plied, that I mu&s;t fir&s;t declare my&s;elf a lover, before &s;he could think of giving me any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer on this head; that, was &s;he even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ecrets, &s;he would not &s;acrifice a lady's delicacy to any con&s;ideration; and wondered how I could think of participating in her con|fidence while I held her at &s;uch a di&s;tance from mine.&mdash;Upon the whole, &s;he believed Mi&s;s Mildmay might perhaps be di&s;engaged; and that, if I
<PB N="27" REF="35">
really entertained a pa&s;&s;ion for her, &s;he did not &s;ee why I had a wor&s;e chance of &s;ucceeding than any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>This, Charles, is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs&mdash;I have &s;ince been twice in company with Loui&s;a, and find the young baggage every moment growing on my imagination.&mdash;I don't know how it is&mdash;Matrimony has a frightful &s;ound with it, and yet I am determined &s;ome time or other to be married&mdash;We are all however for putting the evil day as far off as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;At what parti|cular period my knot is to be tyed I know not; but I fancy the period is not very remote, for every time I think of Mi&s;s Mildmay I begin to be more re|conciled to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the mar|riage ceremony.&mdash;By and by, perhaps, I &s;hall call it, in my &s;i&s;ter's language, a holy in&s;titution; and think of be&s;peak|ing &s;ome &s;uch clum&s;ey varlet as your|&s;elf
<PB N="28" REF="36">
to &s;tand godfather to one of my children.</P>
<P>Egad, Charles, the plot, as Bays &s;ays, begins to thicken.&mdash;Mr. Mildmay and his lady are ju&s;t come to Bath, with a view of taking their daughter home in a week, &s;o that what I do mu&s;t be done &s;peedily&mdash;Upon my &s;oul I did not con|ceive how near this girl was to my heart till I was alarmed with the news of our &s;peedy &s;eparation.&mdash;Lady Haver&s;ham's whole &s;oul, I am &s;en&s;ible, is in the affair&mdash;and you need not be informed what a tenderne&s;s I bear for that amiable &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;You &s;ee, Charles, how I want to make a merit of following my own in|clination.&mdash;But adieu, my dear boy&mdash;I am preparing to attend the adorable Loui&s;a to an a&s;&s;embly this evening, where I &s;hall have her for a partner.&mdash;How all the fellows will envy my hap|pine&s;s,

<HEAD>LETTER III. <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> LOUISA MILDMAY <HI>to Mi&s;s</HI> HARRIOT BEAUCLERK.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;weet fellow, my charming friend, has at la&s;t declared him|&s;elf&mdash;and in &s;uch a manner!&mdash;Well, if I was at fir&s;t &s;truck with the elegance of his figure, I am now ravi&s;hed with the beauties of his conver&s;ation; and &s;hall think my&s;elf the happie&s;t of all human beings, if an alliance can be fortunately brought about between our families.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t letter I told you what a very warm intere&s;t I have with the counte&s;s of Haver&s;ham his &s;i&s;ter; and that &s;he had &s;ounded him in relation to his &s;entiments of me, without giving him the lea&s;t intimation of my having any knowledge of her de&s;ign.&mdash;The
<PB N="31" REF="39">
obliging counte&s;s executed her com|mi&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t delicacy and addre&s;s, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered that all the attention which he paid to that Mi&s;s Townly, the fir&s;t night of our ac|quaintance, was nothing more than the cu&s;tomary effects of his vivacity&mdash;She al&s;o di&s;covered that he thought me in|finitely hand&s;ome; (that was his very word) but &s;he feared he would &s;truggle as much as po&s;&s;ible with his inclina|tions, as he &s;eemed to think it unlikely I &s;hould have &s;till retained my heart, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch numberle&s;s admi|rers (her lady&s;hip was plea&s;ed to &s;ay) as were every day &s;oliciting the happine&s;s of my hand, and applying for the intere&s;t of my father&mdash;However, &s;he was good-naturedly &s;tudious to make parties to bring us together, and la&s;t night he danced with me at a ball, which was given by the French amba&s;&s;ador, highly to the mortification, not only of that
<PB N="32" REF="40">
Mi&s;s Townly, but of &s;everal other ladies, who had flattered them&s;elves with the hope of engaging him for a partner.</P>
<P>During the whole cour&s;e of the even|ing he &s;carcely attended to any thing but the means of obliging me.&mdash;In a thou&s;and little circum&s;tances he mani|fe&s;ted both his tenderne&s;s and his deli|cacy; and in a thou&s;and delightful whi&s;pers in&s;inuated &s;uch well turned compliments, as nothing but affectation it&s;elf could po&s;&s;ibly be offended with&mdash;Whenever he touched my hand he was &s;eized with &s;o exqui&s;ite a tremor as went to my very heart; and the envy which he vi&s;ibly excited in the bo&s;om of almo&s;t every other woman in the room, gave him &s;uch an additional charm, that he appeared as much an Oroondates to my fancy, as if I had been a heroine in &s;ome romance, and was
<PB N="33" REF="41">
but newly delivered from the dungeon of a mercile&s;s giant, in con&s;equence of his prowe&s;s and magnanimity.</P>
<P>I have before told you that the fir&s;t time I ever &s;aw Sir Robert Harold, was at the playhou&s;e here; and that the cha&s;|ti&s;ement which he there publicly be|&s;towed on two young officers, who rude|ly pu&s;hed a lady down, and &s;eemed rather inclined to defend than to apolo|gize for their brutality, was what rivetted him in my affection&mdash;Yet Harriot, were you to &s;ee the dear fellow, you would be charmed with him&mdash;In his per&s;on he is tall&mdash;but not &s;o tall as to be inelegant in the lea&s;t, nor &s;o much inclined either to the extremes of corpulence or deli|cacy, as to be awkward on the one hand, or effeminate on the other; in &s;hort, the medium is &s;o happy as to give the cleare&s;t idea imaginable of man|line&s;s and grace; and his legs are &s;o
<PB N="34" REF="42">
admirably formed&mdash;Indeed, Harriot, I don't believe there is a finer made man in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As to his face there is no po&s;&s;ibility of doing it ju&s;tice in the de&s;cription.&mdash;You may perhaps imagine that I am on this occa&s;ion actuated by the par|tiality of a giddy headed girl, who, having once confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf enamour|ed of a man, thinks it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for the credit of her ta&s;te, to paint him as the invariable &s;tandard of per|fection.&mdash;Indeed, Harriot, I have no nece&s;&s;ity to be under &s;o ridiculous an influence&mdash;Sir Robert is &s;o much the every thing I could wi&s;h him to be, that exaggeration would be as u&s;ele&s;s as it is impo&s;&s;ible; and only betray the exce&s;s of my weakne&s;s, without adding in the lea&s;t to the credit of his attrac|tions.&mdash;His face, however, my dear, is di&s;tingui&s;hed with a certain energy of
<PB N="35" REF="43">
expre&s;&s;ion, that throws out a whole &s;oul upon every feature; and darts &s;uch an immediate meaning upon your bo&s;om, that, had he been actually born dumb, he might have been &s;et down as one of the fir&s;t conver&s;ationi&s;ts in the kingdom. Add to this, that there is an inherent &s;tamp of condition in his air, which in|dicates the man of fa&s;hion, and, at fir&s;t &s;ight, no le&s;s engages your e&s;teem than it excites your admiration&mdash;His com|plexion is a dark brown&mdash;but &s;o deli|cate.&mdash;His eyes are of a deep black; but replete with &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s and fire, that, though he kills you in a manner with a glance, he throws an ely&s;ium on the wound, and le&s;&s;ens every &s;uffering of your &s;en&s;ibility with an extacy un|utterable.&mdash;Do, Harriot, laugh at my flight if you plea&s;e&mdash;but remember the time is arrived, when even my &s;weet friend, with all her gravity, can be in over head and ears, and therefore &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="36" REF="44">
allow for the hyperboles of other doat|ing girls, by the allowances which are nece&s;&s;ary for her own.&mdash;One word more about externals and I have done.&mdash;You know I am a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer of fine teeth&mdash;Sir Robert has a mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite &s;et; and they are always &s;o white&mdash;that nothing can equal their beauty, in my opinion, but the lips which enclo&s;e them.</P>
<P>You have thus, my dear Harriot, a faint &s;ketch of Sir Robert Harold's ex|terior accompli&s;hments.&mdash;As to other matters, his education is fini&s;hed; his fortune is extremely large; his courage approved, and his under&s;tanding un|que&s;tionable.&mdash;He has indeed taken &s;ome extraordinary liberties among the women; but where a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many attractions, he mu&s;t frequently meet with extraordinary encouragement&mdash;and if women will be fools, it is but
<PB N="37" REF="45">
rea&s;onable they &s;hould be &s;ufferers.&mdash;There is a part of his character which I know my dear Harriot will be highly taken with; and that is, though he is a great admirer of magnificence, he always makes it a rule to live con&s;iderably within his fortune, and to di&s;tribute many &s;ums towards the advancement of his poor tenants, which the mo&s;t of our modern fine gentlemen injudiciou&s;ly ex|pend in hor&s;e-racing, or in &s;ome other fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement equally inhuman and ridiculous. His benevolence, in this re&s;pect, joined to the mo&s;t conde&s;cending affability, has rendered him the idol of all his inferiors in the country; and, for a circuit of twenty miles round his &s;eat in Devon&s;hire, there is &s;carcely a pea&s;ant who would not venture his life for Sir Robert Harold with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s.&mdash;Before ever I &s;aw him, Harriot, I was delighted with his character&mdash;&s;o that it was no wonder, when I did &s;ee him, if
<PB N="38" REF="46">
my heart paid an hone&s;t tribute to his merit, and pa&s;&s;ionately longed for a &s;hare of his regard.&mdash;Well, but to the point&mdash;</P>
<P>This morning he came, about twelve, to enquire after my health and to pay the cu&s;tomary compliments; my papa and mamma were fortunately at a concert in the rooms, and the dear man had a whole hour at lea&s;t to entertain me on a &s;ubject, which few women, you know, whether they like the lover or not, ever think di&s;agreeable.&mdash;He was in a mo&s;t charming undre&s;s, and looked &s;o &s;weet|ly!&mdash;You may be &s;ure, my dear, the nature of his conver&s;ation did not take, in any great degree, from the force of his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>After politely repeating his acknow|ledgements for the honour I had done him the preceding evening, he drew
<PB N="39" REF="47">
his chair clo&s;e to mine, and, with an addre&s;s inconceivably tender, took up one of my motionle&s;s hands, pre&s;&s;ed it with an uncommon degree of fervor to his lips, and thus went on, delicately looking down the whole time, to pre|vent, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the confu&s;ion into which I mu&s;t be naturally thrown by the tendency of his declaration.</P>
<Q><P>I would not, my charming Mi&s;s Mildmay, have pre&s;umed thus early to make you acquainted with my &s;en|timents, had not the &s;hortne&s;s of your &s;tay at Bath obliged me in &s;ome mea&s;ure to break in upon the niceties of decorum; and rendered it in a manner nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity of coming to an explanation, &s;ince it is more than probable I may never meet with ano|ther &s;o favourable to my hopes:&mdash;A lady like you, madam, who have been
<PB N="40" REF="48">
&s;o long and &s;o properly the object of univer&s;al admiration, cannot be any way &s;urprized at finding a new adorer in every new acquaintance&mdash;but I will not addre&s;s you in the hack|neyed forms of common-place court|&s;hip, nor offer a violence to that de|licacy which is always the companion of &s;uperior merit, by entering into an unnece&s;&s;ary de&s;cant upon tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments, to which nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;tupidity can po&s;&s;ibly be a moment in&s;en&s;ible or unju&s;t.&mdash;From the fir&s;t hour, madam, I &s;aw you, I pa&s;&s;ionately loved&mdash;and, though the di&s;regard which you con&s;tantly mani|fe&s;ted to the &s;olicitation of numbers &s;uperior to my&s;elf both in merit and in fortune, made it doubly pre&s;ump|tuous in me to a&s;pire at &s;uch a ble&s;&s;|ing as your hand&mdash;&s;till, &s;o long as you appeared wholly di&s;engaged, I thought it would be a mark of vene|ration
<PB N="41" REF="49">
to you, as well as an act of ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, to make a profe&s;&s;ion of my everla&s;ting attachment; and to enquire whether it would be po&s;&s;ible, for a length of time, and an undeviat|ing a&s;&s;iduity, to procure me adi&s;tant glimmering of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, whom I made the con|fidante of my pa&s;&s;ion, indeed advi&s;ed me to an application to Mr. Mildmay&mdash;but, as a &s;tep of that nature might perhaps interfere with &s;ome wi&s;h of the beautiful Loui&s;a's, I would on no account hazard it without her per|mi&s;&s;ion; young ladies very frequently &s;ee matters in a ju&s;ter light than their fathers&mdash;and there are a thou&s;and little rea&s;ons for con&s;ulting them on the bu&s;ine&s;s of their own hearts before a treaty is opened with their relations.&mdash;On this account, my ever adorable Mi&s;s Mildway, I throw my&s;elf en|tirely
<PB N="42" REF="50">
upon your genero&s;ity.&mdash;If you have any latent motive for wi&s;hing me to decline a farther &s;olicitation on this &s;ubject, be candid and tell me &s;o. The man before you, madam, would &s;corn to purcha&s;e the happine&s;s even of his whole life, by the pro&s;ecution of any &s;uit in the lea&s;t incompatible with your tranquility: he may be mi&s;erable, but he never will be mean; and has too high an idea of Mi&s;s Mildmay's benignity to think &s;he would willing|ly add to his anxiety by an unne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;pence, if it is ab&s;olutely out of her power to think of ever remov|ing it. You are &s;ilent, too lovely Mi&s;s Mildmay&mdash;fortunate be your &s;ilence, madam: for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall take my leave; and, if I have not your po&s;itive commands to the contrary, will do my&s;elf the honour of waiting upon Mr. Mildmay to-morrow morn|ing.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51">Well, Harriot, and what do you think now&mdash;had not I an a&s;toni&s;hing command of my&s;elf never once to in|terrupt him during &s;o long an addre&s;s?&mdash;I really think I had&mdash;but, &s;ome how, he was &s;o re&s;pectful, and &s;o manly; &s;o deli|cately timid, yet &s;o generou&s;ly impor|tunate; that, for the life of me, I could not &s;ay a &s;yllable by way of reply.&mdash;A man of le&s;s breeding would have been in&s;olent at &s;eeing me &s;o confu&s;ed; would have rudely &s;tared me in the face, and endeavoured to read the &s;entiments of my heart in the various changes of my countenance&mdash;perhaps too he would have expected one of my be&s;t curt'&s;ies; and imagined that I ought to bid him go, in polite terms, to my father. Sir Robert Harold, my dear Harriot, is a lover of quite a different &s;tamp&mdash;the more en|couragement he meets, the more re|&s;pectful he appears; and interprets your &s;ilence into a meaning &s;o refined,

as prevents the lea&s;t violence from reaching your &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;Pray Heaven, Harriot, I do not prove too fond of him&mdash;But, my dear girl, adieu for the pre&s;ent&mdash;and believe me to be, with the mo&s;t unalterable attachment,</P>

apart for the celebration of the nuptials&mdash;and the old gentleman has in&s;i&s;ted upon my pa&s;&s;ing the la&s;t fortnight of that term at his hou&s;e in Oxford&s;hire.</P>
<P>When we had thus agreed about &s;etting the lawyers immediately to work, and providing the wedding cloaths, I was introduced in form to Loui&s;a; who, to do her ju&s;tice, was &s;carce a remove from a divinity&mdash;Her naturally fine complexion was deepened with a mo&s;t enchanting glow of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and the delicious &s;en&s;ibility that &s;wam in her charming black eyes, gave her, in my opinion, an air which rendered her wholly irre&s;i&s;table.&mdash;She received my &s;alute with dignity, yet with conde|&s;cen&s;ion; and the obliging old people, very properly judging their ab&s;ence would be infinitely more agreeable than their company, withdrew in a little time, and gave me an opportunity of thank|ing

her in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate terms for making me the happie&s;t of mankind.&mdash;She was plea&s;ed, I could plainly &s;ee, with my emotion&mdash;yet &s;he laboured under all that di&s;tre&s;s which a delicate woman is &s;ure to feel upon the pro&s;pect of &s;o important a change in her condition&mdash;I therefore took my leave as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to give her an opportunity of recovering her &s;pirits, but not before I had previou&s;ly obtained her permi&s;&s;ion to drink tea with her in the evening.</P>

<P>IF po&s;&s;ible, my charming friend, I &s;hall be down with you in Oxford&s;hire by the day which I hope will make you the happie&s;t of women; and I wi&s;h with all my &s;oul I could get my mama's permi&s;&s;ion to go down &s;ooner, as I do not at all approve of tru&s;ting you &s;o much in company with a man of whom you are &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond, till the ceremony takes place. You tell me that you and he &s;it up for hours together, and enjoy the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tete a tetes after the family are in bed&mdash;Take care, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, take care; the&s;e tete a tetes are very dangerous things to a woman of your circum|&s;tances; and an in&s;idious lover might, in

&s;ome unguarded moment, reap &s;uch an advantage from them, as &s;hould make my &s;weet friend an ab&s;olute dependant on his mercy, both for happine&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, my dear girl, that I am here in&s;inuating any improper doubts of your di&s;cretion; I know you have as much prudence as any young woman in England&mdash;but, believe me, Loui&s;a, I &s;hould tremble for any young woman in England whom I &s;aw in your circum&s;tances. Your lover is a man endued with every art of per&s;ua&s;ion and every advantage of per&s;on&mdash;he is in a few days to be your hu&s;band; and, from the nature of his connexion, as well as from the exce&s;s of your tender|ne&s;s, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t unlimited &s;hare of your confidence. If, therefore, in &s;ome unhappy moment, he &s;hould be uncommonly importunate for an antici|pation
<PB N="58" REF="66">
of his happine&s;s, my beautiful friend might find it difficult to with&s;tand his &s;olicitations; the tenderne&s;s of her heart might po&s;&s;ibly prevail over the force of her under&s;tanding; and, to e&s;tabli&s;h a momentary repo&s;e in his bo&s;om, &s;he might, perhaps, with a mad|ne&s;s of genero&s;ity, de&s;troy the everla&s;t|ing tranquility of her own.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;tages in a woman's life, none is &s;o dangerous as the period be|tween her acknowledgement of a pa&s;&s;ion for a man, and the day &s;et apart for her nuptials. Her mind, during that in|terval, is &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions un|u&s;ually tender; and the happy lover is admitted to a number of familiarities, which are in them&s;elves the &s;tronge&s;t temptations. Without any premeditat|ed de&s;ign, he is frequently inflamed by the unre&s;erved &s;oftne&s;s which his mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;&s;umes in the un&s;u&s;pecting confidence
<PB N="59" REF="67">
of her heart; and, unable, perhaps, to re&s;i&s;t the impetuo&s;ity of his wi&s;hes, he endeavours to make the mo&s;t of his op|portunity. Secure of pardon, even if he gives the mo&s;t palpable offence, he pro|ceeds with boldne&s;s to the accompli&s;h|ment of his purpo&s;e; and too many have been the unhappy young women who found them&s;elves undone, before they entertained even a di&s;tant fear of de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon circum&s;tance among the men, my deare&s;t Loui&s;a, to try how far there is a po&s;&s;ibility of car|rying their power over a believing woman; and, greatly as they &s;eem to be obliged by the &s;acrifice which we make them, I do not imagine there was ever a ca&s;e in which one of them liked us the better for &s;o convincing a proof of our affection&mdash;whereas, on the contrary,
<PB N="60" REF="68">
we have numberle&s;s in&s;tances where that very proof has excited their di&s;gu&s;t, and induced them to ca&s;t us off
<Q>Like a dete&s;ted Sin,</Q>
as poor Monimia &s;ays, to the irreparable injury both of our peace and our charac|ters. Even where our permitting a lover to anticipate the rights of a hu&s;band no way interrupts the treaty of marriage, &s;till it le&s;&s;ens us &s;o much in his opinion, that he ever after &s;u&s;pects our fidelity, and imagines that what proceeded en|tirely from a pa&s;&s;ionate regard for him|&s;elf, was the actual re&s;ult either of le|vity or con&s;titution. This &s;ingle &s;uppo|&s;ition is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to imbitter all the &s;weets of the hymenaeal union; to bla&s;t all the ro&s;es round the pillows of love, and to plant perpetual thorns in their &s;tead.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. <HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD <HI>to</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>FINAL de&s;truction &s;eize on all the world!</Q>
&mdash;Perhaps, Melmoth, there is not a fellow this moment exi&s;t|ing &s;o compleatly mi&s;erable as I&mdash;I have &s;ucceeded, fatally &s;ucceeded, with this amiable wretch, and both of us mu&s;t bid adieu to happine&s;s for ever.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t letter I told you how this beautiful woman had entirely conquered all my indifference by the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of her manner; and that I now longed for the day of our mar|riage with as much impatience as if I had from the fir&s;t been pa&s;&s;ionate|ly &s;mitten. The little &s;eparation from her after her departure from Bath, gave an inconceiveable &s;pur to my inclina|tion;
<PB N="63" REF="71">
and the bewitching air of &s;oftne&s;s with which &s;he received me on my going down to her father's, &s;o com|pleatly did the bu&s;ine&s;s, that I wondered at my own &s;tupidity in being &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible of her perfections.</P>
<P>The good old people, notwith&s;tand|ing they &s;eemed highly delighted with my company, neverthele&s;s, through an injudicious degree of tenderne&s;s both to me and their daughter, took every op|portunity of leaving us together; na|turally enough &s;uppo&s;ing that we &s;hould be be&s;t plea&s;ed to be left to the unin|terrupted enjoyment of each other's con|ver&s;ation; after &s;upper, particularly, they withdrew to their own apartment &s;o early, that Loui&s;a and I had at lea&s;t three or four hours to the good before we could rea&s;onably think of retiring. I need not tell you, Melmoth, that when two young people are left together for
<PB N="64" REF="72">
any length of time, that &s;ome familia|rities will pa&s;s, though even both are actuated by the be&s;t inclinations. Would it not, for in&s;tance, have been &s;urprizing if, circum&s;tanced as I was with Loui&s;a, I had &s;at with her for two or three hours, without ever ravi&s;hing a ki&s;s, pre&s;uming to &s;ink upon her neck, or attempt to cla&s;p her in my arms, when &s;he even conde&s;cendingly acknowledged how ten|derly &s;he loved me? Would it not al&s;o have been equally &s;urprizing had &s;he re|pul&s;ed tho&s;e little effu&s;ions of tran&s;port at the very in&s;tant that they were excit|ed by her own confe&s;&s;ion, and, in a manner, authorized by the con&s;ideration of the union which was &s;o &s;hortly to take place? A contrary behaviour would have been as unnatural as it was impo&s;&s;i|ble; and virtue neither expected nor re|quired more than the re&s;triction of our tran&s;ports within &s;ome &s;en&s;ible bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="73">But alas, Melmoth, who can &s;trike a line to the pa&s;&s;ions, or pretend to tell the impetuous tide of youth,
<Q>go no farther than this</Q>
&mdash;For my own part, as I &s;hall an&s;wer it before God, I never in my life was more dive&s;ted of &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns&mdash;I con&s;idered Loui&s;a in quite a different light from any of tho&s;e women with whom I had formerly trifled; and &s;et her down as a lady, who&s;e reputation was immediately connected with my own&mdash;I &s;aw her, be&s;ides, the only daughter of an honourable family, which it would be unpardonable to di&s;grace; and the friend&s;hip which my &s;i&s;ter entertained for her, was a circum&s;tance of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to have prevented me even from once thinking about the po&s;&s;ibility of attaining her upon any terms that were not &s;trictly honourable.</P>
<P>You have often, my dear Melmoth, called me the mo&s;t &s;entimental libertine
<PB N="66" REF="74">
you ever knew; and once, in a conver&s;a|tion with my &s;i&s;ter Haver&s;ham, a&s;&s;ured her, notwith&s;tanding all my follies, that I was above laying any unmanly &s;chemes for the &s;eduction of innocence; in this you did me nothing more than ju&s;tice&mdash;You your&s;elf know that, in one half of my amours, the advances were &s;o palpable on the wrong &s;ide, that there was no creditable method of getting off, even had I been the mo&s;t &s;anctified pu|ritan in the kingdom.&mdash;You will, there|fore, naturally credit my account, and believe that I am infinitely above any di&s;ingenuous attempts either to palliate or di&s;gui&s;e my part in this unfortunate tran&s;action.</P>
<P>I had been now a full week down at Loui&s;a's, and company from various places was impatiently expected to attend at the approaching &s;olemnity; when, la&s;t night, &s;he and I &s;itting, as u&s;ual,
<PB N="67" REF="75">
to enjoy all the delicious non&s;en&s;e, which generally makes up the principal part of love conver&s;ations, we happened acci|dentally to mention a &s;uit of night cloaths which &s;he had ju&s;t received from London, and which, &s;he &s;aid, became her exce&s;&s;ively; as I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee them on her, &s;he retired immedi|ately to her room, and, in about a quarter of an hour, came down &s;o irre&s;i&s;tably ravi&s;hing, that I was no longer my own ma&s;ter. Imagine to your&s;elf, Melmoth, with all your boa&s;ted apathy of di&s;po&s;i|tion, a woman, &s;uch as I have repeated|ly de&s;cribed Mi&s;s Mildmay, dre&s;&s;ed in a flowing robe of white &s;attin, with her fine black hair hanging carele&s;sly down her neck; and every thing in the mo&s;t volup|tuous di&s;order&mdash;Imagine this, I &s;ay, and tell me hone&s;tly whether you could have beheld her without emotion?&mdash;If you could, you mu&s;t either be &s;omething more or le&s;s than human&mdash;For my part I was
<PB N="68" REF="76">
mere fle&s;h and blood&mdash;I &s;natched her to my bo&s;om with a phrenzy of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate admiration, and almo&s;t &s;tifled her with ki&s;&s;es&mdash;The extatic tender|ne&s;s with which &s;he received my em|brace entirely de&s;troyed my recollection; and a cur&s;ed &s;opha lying mo&s;t conve|niently ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the purpo&s;es of my ra&s;hne&s;s, I proceeded from liberty to li|berty till &s;he was actually undone.</P>
<P>The guilty triumph thus compleated, we were both in an in&s;tant perfectly &s;en|&s;ible of our indi&s;cretion&mdash;Loui&s;a &s;talked to her chair with a mingled air of the mo&s;t fixed a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;tre&s;s, and pre&s;erved a profound &s;ilence for &s;ome minutes, till, at la&s;t, unable to endure the conflict in her bo&s;om any longer, &s;he hid her face in a handkerchief, and gave loo&s;e to a violent flood of tears. For my own part, Melmoth, I was equally tortured by &s;hame and regret&mdash;for the
<PB N="69" REF="77">
fir&s;t time in my life, I felt &s;uch a morti|fication at &s;ucceeding with a fine woman, that I could not for the &s;oul of me &s;ay a &s;yllable of comfort to her. The mi|&s;eries which I ea&s;ily fore&s;aw mu&s;t ari&s;e from this unfortunate lap&s;e, crouded at once upon my imagination; &s;o that that conque&s;t which, at another time, perhaps, would have been the highe&s;t gratification to my vanity, now &s;erved only to wound my &s;en&s;ibility, and to fill me with the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The wretched Loui&s;a &s;till continuing fixed with her elbows on her knees, her head &s;upported by her two hands, and her face covered with her handkerchief; I walked over to her chair in a &s;tate of united angui&s;h and irre&s;olution&mdash;bleed|ing for what I &s;aw her &s;uffer, yet fearing to offer her the &s;malle&s;t con&s;olation&mdash;However, in&s;tinctively dropping upon one knee, I begged &s;he would be com|po&s;ed,
<PB N="70" REF="78">
and a&s;&s;ured her that what had happened rather enhanced than le&s;&s;ened my affection; and that, as I was her hu&s;band in every thing but the cere|mony, there was no offence what&s;oever committed again&s;t virtue&mdash;Form, I ob&s;erved, was alone what we had violat|ed; and, as the &s;ecret was entirely con|fined to our&s;elves, there was little occa|&s;ion either for confu&s;ion or regret.</P>
<P>We are all of us, my dear Melmoth, ready enough to believe what we wi&s;h may be true; and poor Loui&s;a, though &s;he could not be convinced by the force of my rea&s;onings, neverthele&s;s attempted to be chearful; &s;he wiped her charming eyes therefore, and &s;eemed delighted at the re&s;pectful attitude in which &s;he be|held me, for I &s;till continued on my knee, and endeavoured, by all the little tenderne&s;&s;es in my power, to rai&s;e her
<PB N="71" REF="79">
into credit with her&s;elf&mdash;I talked fami|liarly about the wedding day, called her my wife in the mo&s;t melting accent I could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; and, at intervals, took the liberty of chiding her anxiety as an equal doubt of my honour and my love&mdash;At la&s;t, I &s;ucceeded pretty well in re-a&s;&s;uring her: &s;he ventured to look up with an air of &s;ome confidence, conde&s;cended to play with my fingers, and even once went &s;o far as to honour my hand with her lips&mdash;I need &s;carcely inform you what the con&s;equence was&mdash;The tide of pa&s;&s;ion was in an in&s;tant &s;welled up to the cu&s;tomary height&mdash;and every impul&s;e of recollection was again &s;wept away upon the couch.</P>
<P>Such, Melmoth, is the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion of affairs between Loui&s;a and your unfortunate friend; what to do I know not&mdash;You are not to be told how ro|mantically delicate I am in my notions
<PB N="72" REF="80">
about women.&mdash;It is with me a fixed principle, that the &s;ame woman who &s;uffers even the man &s;he doats upon to di&s;traction, to take advantage of an un|guarded moment, will have her un|guarded moments with other people&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ion will, in all probability, often &s;upply the want of inclination; and the &s;ame warmth of con&s;titution which ori|ginally betrayed her into an indi&s;cretion with him, is but too likely to make her guilty of indi&s;cretions with every body el&s;e. How frequently, Charles, in the keene&s;s of appetite, have I, where more agreeable di&s;hes were not immediately at hand, fallen greedily up|on &s;uch fare as actually turned my &s;tomach when I came to con&s;ider it? Women, like our&s;elves, are only fle&s;h and blood&mdash;de&s;ires are as natural to them as to us, and who can take upon him to &s;ay, when the favourite object of their wi&s;hes is at any di&s;tance, but
<PB N="73" REF="81">
what nece&s;&s;ity may immediately meta|morpho&s;e a piece of coar&s;e beef into an ab&s;olute ortolan?</P>
<P>This, you will po&s;&s;ibly ob&s;erve, is bringing a general charge again&s;t the &s;ex, and &s;uppo&s;ing that there is no &s;uch thing as virtue exi&s;ting in any indivi|dual of the whole&mdash;An opinion of &s;uch a nature is what I am neither ba&s;e enough nor weak enough to adopt&mdash;Coxbomb as I may be in &s;ome re&s;pects, and greatly as my vanity has been flat|tered by &s;ucce&s;s among the ladies, &s;till I was never one of tho&s;e fellows who thought the &s;ex univer&s;ally depraved&mdash;On the contrary, I dare &s;ay there are thou&s;ands who are capable of re&s;i&s;ting the deepe&s;t &s;ubtleties of the mo&s;t plau&s;i|ble de&s;ign&mdash;But where we have our&s;elves experienced the frailty of a woman, it is natural enough to form an idea upon what we know; and rea&s;onable enough
<PB N="74" REF="82">
to judge, from her behaviour in one or two circum&s;tances, what her conduct is likely to be in all.</P>
<P>After a declaration of this kind, you may probably imagine that I do not intend marrying Mi&s;s Mildmay, not|with&s;tanding the treaty has been carried &s;o far between the two families; you are, however, much mi&s;taken. Greatly as this unhappy affair has &s;unk her in my opinion, I &s;hall neverthele&s;s pay a rigid attention to the &s;anctity of my word&mdash;But though I &s;hall behave with ju&s;tice, I &s;hall al&s;o act with candour.&mdash;I &s;hall in|form her how utterly impo&s;&s;ible it will be for her ever to recover my confidence after what has pa&s;t; and if &s;he is weak enough to accept my hand while I make a po&s;itive avowal of my contempt, why, &s;he mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>This morning &s;he came down to breakfa&s;t with an encrea&s;ed degree of
<PB N="75" REF="83">
beauty, if it is po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch beauty to admit of an encrea&s;e&mdash;The delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that flu&s;hed upon her cheek, enlighted her com|plexion into an ab&s;olute blaze of per|fection; while the &s;peaking &s;en&s;ibility of a down-ca&s;t eye threw &s;uch a mode&s;ty over her features, as rendered her the fine&s;t picture which fancy could con|ceive of the &s;ofte&s;t innocence and love. Her father, charmed with her appear|ance, turned round to me, and, in a very low whi&s;per, &s;aid,
<Q>Ah Harold, you &s;ee the &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy of my poor girl&mdash;the day is now &s;o near &s;he cannot look at you with any degree of re&s;olu|tion.</Q>
Unhappy old man! little does he imagine what a loo&s;e all that wonder|ful &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy can give to the dictates of an unhallowed imagination&mdash;Little does he think how &s;he burned in my arms la&s;t night, and poured out her whole &s;oul in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate &s;torm of a voluptuous inclination. But, alas, Mel|moth,
<PB N="76" REF="84">
why do I harrow up my recol|lection with that cur&s;ed night&mdash;it has given me an eternal aver&s;ion to the only woman I can ever look upon with tender|ne&s;s; and fa&s;tened all the &s;corpions of an invincible hatred to the bo&s;om of an ex|travagant love. You can &s;carcely imagine, my dear Melmoth, what I felt at her approach&mdash;My indignation was no le&s;s excited than my tran&s;port, and I could not help &s;aying to my&s;elf,
<Q>how a&s;to|ni&s;hingly is that creature calculated to deceive! This moment, when I know her &s;tained and polluted, what an angel-like air &s;he a&s;&s;umes; as if ut|terly uncon&s;cious of a blot, and no le&s;s un&s;ullied in her mind, than fault|le&s;s in her per&s;on.</Q>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VII.</HI> Mrs. <HI>MILDMAY</HI> to the Right Hon. the Counte&s;s of <HI>HAVERSHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>O LADY Haver&s;ham, what &s;hall I do, or where &s;hall I go&mdash;your in|human brother has broke my heart&mdash;and my unfortunate child, that was once the darling of my age, is now ca&s;t out from the arms of her father, and ex|po&s;ed as well to the dete&s;tation as the contempt of all her family. If I can any way &s;upport my &s;pirits to go through with the &s;hocking &s;tory you &s;hall be ac|quainted with all&mdash;you have fine &s;en&s;e, lady Haver&s;ham; you have great huma|nity&mdash;and can allow for the di&s;traction of an unhappy mother, torn in a mo|ment from the enjoyment of all her hopes, and doomed to langui&s;h out the little remainder of her days in equal wretchedne&s;s and di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="87">Here my poor Mr. Mildmay and I were felicitating each other at the pro&s;pect of an approaching union between our family and your's; and waiting with im|patience for the day which was to &s;ecure our child in the protection of a worthy hu&s;band&mdash;Nothing but your pre&s;ence, the pre&s;ence of our &s;on, and the com|pany of a few particular friends, was wanting to complete our happine&s;s&mdash;O that we could have prevailed upon you to accompany your cruel brother down! The irreparable injury which has mur|dered all our tranquility, had then never happened; and we &s;hould now be ex|ulting in felicity, in&s;tead of &s;inking be|neath a load of unutterable &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting in my own parlour this morning, reading my favourite Sherlock upon Death, when Sally, my daughter's maid, &s;creamed out from the top of the
<PB N="80" REF="88">
&s;tairs, that her mi&s;tre&s;s was dying. Ter|rified at this information, as you may naturally imagine, I ha&s;tened to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and found the unfortunate girl in a very &s;trong hy&s;teric, &s;tretched upon the floor, and Sally in vain at|tempting to rai&s;e her up. By this time, two or three of the other women &s;er|vants, joined us, and we lifted her be|tween us into an arm chair; where, with a great deal of difficulty, &s;he was brought a little to her&s;elf&mdash;She &s;carcely recover|ed, however, when &s;he fell into another fit; and continued in a cour&s;e of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive faintings for &s;everal hours&mdash;&s;o that I thought it prudent to &s;end a chariot, and &s;ix of our be&s;t hor&s;es, for doctor Webley. About five o'clock in the evening &s;he became pretty well compo&s;ed, and the exce&s;&s;ive fatigue &s;he had undergone threw her into a profound &s;leep; in which &s;he lay till very near twelve&mdash;During the prin|cipal
<PB N="81" REF="89">
part of this melancholy &s;cene, my poor Mr. Mildmay and I were not five minutes ab&s;ent from the room. Her father, you know, doated on her, if po&s;&s;ible, with a degree of tenderne&s;s more piercingly &s;en&s;ible than my&s;elf&mdash;he hung over her continually, in an agony of &s;peechle&s;s di&s;traction; tore the white hair from his temples, or turned up his eyes towards Heaven, as if he meant to expo&s;tulate with the Divine Being, for vi&s;iting his daughter with &s;uch an afflic|tion, at a time when he looked for nothing but the mo&s;t perfect content. His di&s;tre&s;s you may ea&s;ily conclude was a con&s;iderable aggravation of what I felt for my wretched child; and, though I endeavoured to con&s;ole him, every effort which I made for that purpo&s;e, rendered me doubly in need of con&s;olation my&s;elf. All this time I was totally ignorant of what occa&s;ioned the unhappy girl's di|&s;tre&s;s; and I tortured my imagination
<PB N="82" REF="90">
ince&s;&s;antly, with endeavouring to think upon &s;ome probable cau&s;e&mdash;But judge, lady Haver&s;ham, of my di&s;traction, when the poor deluded creature, &s;truck with the angui&s;h into which &s;he &s;aw us plung|ed, &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity that her perfect recovery to rea&s;on &s;upplied, of informing me that &s;he was totally un|worthy of the lea&s;t regard; that &s;he had fatally &s;acrificed the honour of her fa|mily; that Sir Robert Harold was irre|coverably lo&s;t; and that death was the only thing which could po&s;&s;ibly put a period to her afflictions. In &s;hort, the keene&s;s of her &s;en&s;ibility would not allow her to keep any thing concealed; &s;he let me into the whole &s;tory of her guilty intercour&s;e with your brother&mdash;and the agonies into which the horrid di&s;covery naturally threw me, &s;weeping away every trace of her recollection, &s;he made no &s;cruple, in the fullne&s;s of her &s;oul, to mention the cau&s;e of my

agitation to her father; upbraiding her|&s;elf at the &s;ame time as the wor&s;t of parricides, who had not only &s;hortened my days, but murdered my reputation.</P>
<P>You know my, dear lady Haver&s;ham, how rigidly refined my poor Mr. Mild|may is in every thing which concerns the female delicacy of his family. You know he can &s;carcely allow for the mo&s;t ca&s;ual infirmities of human nature in a woman; though he prepo&s;terou&s;ly thinks the other &s;ex is entitled to the mo&s;t un|limited indulgence&mdash;All his pity, there|fore, for his mi&s;erable daughter, was in|&s;tantly turned into an extravagant rage&mdash;he &s;purned the wretched girl as &s;he lay at his feet, lamenting her fatal indi&s;cre|tion, in language that would pierce a heart of adamant, and imploring his forgivene&s;s with all the forcible rhetoric of &s;treaming eyes, a bur&s;ting bo&s;om, and a pro&s;trate &s;upplication. In vain did
<PB N="84" REF="92">
I kneel with my child, (for, O lady Haver&s;ham, notwith&s;tanding the great|ne&s;s of her crime, I cannot drive the mother from my heart,) and conjure him, by whatever I thought mo&s;t affect|ing, to pity her; the more earne&s;t we were in our &s;olicitation, the more inexo|rable he became in his re&s;entment, till at la&s;t, worked up to a phren&s;y of in|dignation, he poured out a mo&s;t barbar|ous execration on her, and command|ed me, in a tone which I never pre&s;um|ed to di&s;pute, to &s;ee the infamous &s;trumpet (that was his cruel word) turned out of the hou&s;e in le&s;s than an hour, as I either valued his repo&s;e, or my own tranquility. My own tranquility, lady Haver&s;ham&mdash;Alas, I &s;hall never know a moment's happine&s;s more!&mdash;My peace of mind is eternally de&s;troyed; and, &s;o long as I retain the &s;en&s;e of feeling, I mu&s;t be tremblingly alive to the united wounds both of misfortune and di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="93">Mr. Mildmay, after pronouncing this &s;entence on his lo&s;t unhappy daughter, flew out of the room, though it was pa&s;t twelve o'clock at night, though the &s;ea&s;on was remarkably &s;evere, and though a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind and rain was at that very moment abroad&mdash;No|thing could induce him to delay the execution of his commands till morning&mdash;Utterly deaf to my remon&s;trances, he in&s;i&s;ted upon expo&s;ing her to all the fury of the elements; and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that I prevailed upon him, at la&s;t, to let the chariot take her to farmer Wil&s;on's, at the end of the avenue; in fact, as well as all parental feeling, he &s;eemed to put off all com|mon humanity; and to rejoice at the horror of the night in which &s;he was to be driven out, though, but half an hour before, he would have &s;huddered,
<Q><L>&mdash;Le&s;t the winds of Heaven</L>
<L>Should vi&s;it her face too roughly&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="86" REF="94">
O lady Haver&s;ham, how happy are you in a want of children&mdash;You have a thou|&s;and times lamented in my hearing that you never had a child&mdash;Yet, was it po&s;&s;ible for you to imagine but the &s;malle&s;t part of my di&s;tre&s;s, you would own the kindne&s;s of Providence was never more manife&s;ted than in the re|fu&s;al of what you think a ble&s;&s;ing, and what I experience to be the greate&s;t of all misfortunes.&mdash;But to go on:</P>
<P>The &s;everity which Mr. Mildmay thus relentle&s;sly exerci&s;ed on his mi&s;erable child, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ubdued the re&s;entment which I my&s;elf &s;hould other|wi&s;e have entertained again&s;t her; I could not therefore re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t ample indulgence of maternal tenderne&s;s, when the moment of &s;eparation came on; I pre&s;&s;ed her to my heart with as much cordiality as if &s;he had never offended, and entirely forgot the nature of her
<PB N="87" REF="95">
fault, in the apprehen&s;ion of never &s;ee|ing her again. The poor girl was quite unable to &s;upport her&s;elf again&s;t what &s;he called an exce&s;s of goodne&s;s&mdash;&s;he fell repeatedly on her knees to ki&s;s my hands; drenched them with her tears; and departed, leaning on the arm of her Sally, with a de&s;ire that I would forget there ever had been &s;uch a creature as her&s;elf; and a reque&s;t that I would trans|fer all the affection which &s;he had &s;o &s;hamefully di&s;graced, to the advance|ment of her brother's happine&s;s, and the re&s;toration of her father's tranquility.</P>
<P>During the &s;hort time allowed us to take leave, we agreed that &s;he &s;hould go to her cou&s;in Darnel's in London; as Mrs. Darnel is a very grave woman, and has &s;ome obligations to our family, which mu&s;t render her additionally &s;oli|citous about Loui&s;a's accommodation.&mdash;There, if her unhappy lap&s;e &s;hould be
<PB N="88" REF="96">
attended with any con&s;equences, &s;he will be &s;ure of tenderne&s;s and &s;ecrecy. I have packed up all her cloaths and her little ornaments; and, in one of her trunks, &s;hall &s;end up, unknown to her father, a bank note of five hundred pounds. This will maintain her till I find whether there is a po&s;&s;ibility of prevailing on Mr. Mildmay to overlook her fault&mdash;If, as I much apprehend, a reconcilation with him will be extremely difficult, I mu&s;t make her what remittances I can, as he will never think tho&s;e entitled to any in&s;tances of his bounty whom he makes the objects of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Such, my dear lady Haver&s;ham, is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of your unfortunate friend. Your cruel, your inhuman bro|ther, may, perhaps, triumph in the de|&s;olation which he has occa&s;ioned; and, like the generality of low minded-liber|tines, imagine that, in proportion as &s;he
<PB N="89" REF="97">
has aggravated the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a family that &s;incerely loved and e&s;teemed him, he has made a fre&s;h acqui&s;ition to the importance of his character.&mdash;You, I know, will heartily &s;ympathize in our afflictions&mdash;You are his &s;i&s;ter, but not the abettor of his crimes&mdash;and therefore, I am per&s;uaded, every thing in your power will be done, to procure us the mo&s;t effectual redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The only redre&s;s which we can now have, is an in&s;tant renewal of the late treaty; which your brother &s;o cruelly di&s;turbed. About two hours before I fir&s;t heard of Loui&s;a's illne&s;s, it &s;eems he rode away from this upon a pretend|ed vi&s;it to the earl of A&mdash;; but, as he has never been heard of &s;ince, I &s;up|po&s;e he is in London by this time, enter|taining his di&s;&s;olute companions with the de&s;truction of poor Loui&s;a Mildmay. O, lady Haver&s;ham, don't you wonder
<PB N="90" REF="98">
that, in &s;uch a di&s;traction of mind, I am able to write with the lea&s;t method or propriety? The power of recollection, however, is a faculty which is no way enviable in the wretched; and tho&s;e who have unhappily lo&s;t their peace of mind, ought, in my opinion, to wi&s;h for an immediate lo&s;s of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my indignation at your brother's barbarity, lady Haver|&s;ham, I am neverthele&s;s ready to over|look every thing which has happened, if he comes down again and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hes, as far as he yet can, the repo&s;e of our family&mdash;Loui&s;a I am &s;ure mu&s;t doat with the mo&s;t extravagant fondne&s;s on him, or &s;he never could have made &s;uch a &s;acrifice&mdash;her forgivene&s;s, there|fore, e&s;pecially if I intere&s;t my&s;elf in the affair, is not very difficult to be obtain|ed; and, perhaps, Mr. Mildmay, when he &s;ees that there is no other cour&s;e to
<PB N="91" REF="99">
follow, may be brought to abate a little of his re&s;entment. My rea&s;on for being thus anxious for an accommodation of this unhappy affair, is a fear, le&s;t, when my &s;on comes to hear of it, he may take &s;ome de&s;perate revenge, which will involve us in new calamities&mdash;You know he is brave to a fault, and piques him&s;elf exce&s;&s;ively on the dignity of his profe&s;&s;ion, and the reputation of his family. Should he, therefore, think of calling your brother to an account, I may po&s;&s;ibly be robbed of both my children, and may have the murder of my daughter's honour inconceivably ag|gravated by the timele&s;s death of my &s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ame con&s;ideration, lady Haver|&s;ham, which renders me anxious for the pre&s;ervation of a &s;on, mu&s;t naturally in|fluence your conduct for the &s;afety of a
<PB N="92" REF="100">
brother, even admitting that a per&s;on of your lady&s;hip's well known benevolence &s;hould, upon &s;o affecting an occa&s;ion, be cold to the dictates of ju&s;tice, or the feelings of humanity.

This letter have di&s;patched by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, as I wanted to &s;end you the jewels, which your brother a few days ago pre&s;ented to Loui&s;a; and which, at part|ing, the poor girl left with me for that purpo&s;e.

<P>YOU are no doubt impatient, my dear Charles, from the nature of my la&s;t letter, to hear in what manner I conducted my explanatory interview with Mi&s;s Mildmay&mdash;You cannot, however, be more impatient to hear than I am to tell it; yet, &s;omehow, I feel a latent kind of repugnance to enter upon the &s;ubject, as if I was &s;en&s;ible of having acted with a manife&s;t impropriety&mdash;This latent un|ea&s;ine&s;s you have often called the work|ing of hone&s;t con&s;cience, and told me that I might be &s;ure I had done &s;ome unju&s;tifiable action whenever I found it bu&s;y with my tranquility. I am half afraid, Melmoth, that you are right&mdash;This Mi&s;s Mildmay hangs unac|countably upon my heart&mdash;and, was I

ma&s;ter of the univer&s;e, I would give it, either never to have &s;een her, or to throw an everla&s;ting oblivion upon one cur&s;ed tran&s;action.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t on Monday morning, Mr. Mildmay withdrew to his &s;tudy, and Mrs. Mildmay retired to her read|ing parlour: Loui&s;a and I were left alone; and neither of us, for a full half hour, &s;poke a &s;ingle &s;yllable, each ex|pecting the other would begin the con|ver&s;ation&mdash;My &s;ilence, as it was indeed my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;peak fir&s;t, cutting the poor girl to the heart, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and, with &s;ome difficulty, told me, that &s;he plainly &s;aw how much &s;he was le&s;&s;ened in my e&s;teem; and that &s;he was &s;ure, after what had happened, it would be much better to think of breaking off the intended connexion than to carry it on where there was &s;o &s;mall an expectation of happine&s;s&mdash;To
<PB N="96" REF="104">
this I replied, with an air of tenderne&s;s, vi&s;ibly affected however, that &s;he did the highe&s;t inju&s;tice to my love; that I beheld her with more pa&s;&s;ionate admira|tion than ever, and that nothing could be more idle than to teize her&s;elf with the indulgence of a fear that had &s;o little foundation in probability: I concluded this cold compliment, with a bow upon her hand, that indicated very little or no emotion, though it contained a great deal of re&s;pect; and, turning to the window with an air of the mo&s;t mortify|ing unconcern, ob&s;erved that we could &s;carcely hope for any of our expected company while the weather continued &s;o uncommonly boi&s;terous.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was a woman of too much &s;oul to &s;tand again&s;t the attack of a palpable indifference, however &s;peciou&s;ly glo&s;&s;ed over with a &s;mooth civility; and, indeed, I intended my indifference &s;hould be

To a fellow of your knowledge, Melmoth, I need not ob&s;erve how extremely we are pro|voked by a polite &s;erenity, where our hearts are deeply intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue of a debate&mdash;Good breeding, where we want to excite the &s;tronge&s;t emotions, is the mo&s;t aggravating in&s;ult which we can po&s;&s;ibly meet; becau&s;e it equally di&s;appoints our views, and denies us an opportunity of finding fault; con|&s;cious that it would effectually an&s;wer my purpo&s;e, I continued it till I had wound up Loui&s;a to the highe&s;t pitch of pa&s;&s;ion; and <HI>madamed</HI> her with &s;o

profound a degree of veneration, as gave me a &s;peedy occa&s;ion of carrying my de&s;ign into execution.</P>
<P>"Very well, Sir Robert (&s;ays &s;he as I &s;tood playing with a chine&s;e figure on the chimney-piece <HI>&s;o</HI> placid and <HI>&s;o</HI> un|di&s;turbed)

this declaration, went to my very heart&mdash;yet that damned, unhappy, facility with which &s;he yielded to my wi&s;hes, &s;till employ the principal &s;hare of my thoughts. I was determined to act agree|able to the re&s;olution which I had pre|viou&s;ly made, and therefore replied,

<P>The cool &s;arca&s;tic humility of this reply, added greatly to her indignation, but no way got the better of her recol|lection.&mdash;
<Q>Sir Robert (&s;ays &s;he) it is no difficult matter to perceive the whole extent of your de&s;ign&mdash;the

<P>Here Melmoth, was the end of our altercation. Loui&s;a, on fini&s;hing this &s;peech ro&s;e ha&s;tily from her chair, and darting up to her room, as I &s;up|po&s;e, left me to chew the cud of my own reflections, which to &s;peak hone&s;tly my dear Charles, was none of the mo&s;t agreeable&mdash;However, though I was &s;e|cretly plea&s;ed that &s;he had by a very generous effort of &s;oul &s;pared me the mortification of being more than pa&s;&s;ive in the cour&s;e of this tran&s;action; you cannot think how it affected both my pride and my tenderne&s;s, to &s;ee her &s;o apparently ea&s;y upon &s;uch a trying occa&s;ion&mdash;I imagined it would co&s;t her &s;omething more to give me up for ever; and to the di&s;grace of my humanity I mu&s;t own, that it would have no way
<PB N="113" REF="121">
di&s;plea&s;ed me had &s;he &s;hewn a little &s;tronger &s;en&s;ibility in our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Being thus left alone, I rang for Ed|wards, and ordering him to get the chai&s;e ready in an in&s;tant, I &s;et out from Mr. Mildmay's, without taking leave of a &s;ingle &s;oul, leaving only one of the foot|men to bring the portmanteau after me, and ordering Ned to di&s;tribute, agreeable to the inho&s;pitable cu&s;toms of this coun|try, twenty guineas among the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The interval from quitting Mr. Mild|may's till my arrival at Reading, was one of the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ages in my whole life&mdash;Shame and remor&s;e harrowed up my bo&s;om alternately; and, when I reflected upon what Loui&s;a was likely to &s;uffer, I was tortured to di&s;traction. The pitiful figure I made, thus &s;tealing away from a hou&s;e, in which, but the day before, I was ab&s;olutely idolized,
<PB N="114" REF="122">
gave me the &s;evere&s;t mortification; and, in &s;hort, the univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s which I knew mu&s;t re&s;ult from my behaviour, operated &s;o &s;trongly upon my huma|nity, that I was a thou&s;and times ready to turn back, with a re&s;olution of &s;acri|ficing my own peace of mind to pre|&s;erve the quiet of my ever amiable &s;i&s;ter; the beautiful Loui&s;a; and her re&s;pecta|ble family. But when I con&s;idered what had pa&s;&s;ed; when I con&s;idered what might probably happen; every thing fell before the arguments of my pride, and I continued invincibly attached to my fir&s;t determination.</P>
<P>O Melmoth, did the&s;e women but know how we wor&s;hip them for refu&s;ing to gratify our wi&s;hes&mdash;did they but know how me doat upon the indig|nation of a fine eye, when fired into a blaze of con&s;cious virtue, and &s;triking an in&s;tant confu&s;ion upon the
<PB N="115" REF="123">
pre&s;umptuous addre&s;&s;es of a de&s;igning lover; how few of them would li&s;ten to an improper &s;olicitation?&mdash;But, ridicu|lou&s;ly confident of their own fortitude; or prepo&s;terou&s;ly imagining that tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t like to &s;ecure an admirer, which are mo&s;t apt to excite his contempt, they con&s;tantly betray their own cau&s;e, and oblige him in a manner to de&s;pi&s;e and de&s;ert them. But a truce with reflections.</P>
<P>When I came to my inn at Reading, the fir&s;t thing I did was to write a &s;hort letter to Mr. Mildmay, thanking him for the many civilities which he had &s;hewn me; and informing him that it was with inexpre&s;&s;ible regret I quitted his hou&s;e, at a time when I fondly flat|tered my&s;elf with the hope of &s;peedily becoming &s;o near a part of his family; but that, as I had rea&s;ons to believe a union with me, would be no way con|ducive
<PB N="116" REF="124">
to the happine&s;s of his amiable daughter, I had determined to make a &s;acrifice of my own felicity, rather than be the lea&s;t impediment to her's; and concluded with the cu&s;tomary round of common-place compliments, that tingle very prettily on the ear, though they &s;eldom intere&s;t either the heart or the under&s;tanding. This letter I di&s;patched by Edwards, for two rea&s;ons; becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger car|ried an air of greater re&s;pect, than if I had &s;ent it by the po&s;t; and be|cau&s;e, in the &s;econd, I knew Edwards would give a &s;harp look out, and bring me a pretty exact account of every thing which had happened &s;ince my de|parture.</P>
<P>And now, Melmoth, what &s;ay you to the part which I have acted in this affair? Don't you think my dexterity in getting off a ma&s;terpiece; and my for|titude
<PB N="117" REF="125">
in re&s;i&s;ting the importunate re|mon&s;trances of my own heart, an exer|tion of philo&s;ophy, which is at lea&s;t equal to any thing in all antiquity? To be &s;erious, however, though I think you will in the main approve both of my prudence and my re&s;olution, I am ne|verthele&s;s fearful of hearing your &s;enti|ments. As to lady Haver&s;ham, I know &s;he will for &s;ome time be in the pouts, and fancy that I have behaved with the greate&s;t impropriety; but as there is no likelihood of her ever becoming ac|quainted with the real cau&s;e of my pro|ceeding; and as I am con&s;cious her brother is the per&s;on on earth who holds the highe&s;t place in her affections, I am &s;atisfied the &s;torm mu&s;t in a little time blow over, and that a few days will rein&s;tate me perfectly in her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Poor Loui&s;a, was her peace of mind a little e&s;tabli&s;hed, I could with the
<PB N="118" REF="126">
more chearfulne&s;s &s;ubmit to my part of the anxiety; but &s;ome how her di&s;tre&s;s is continually pre&s;ent to my imagination, and my own feelings are perpetually aggravated by the recollection of her &s;ufferings. Women, however, though their &s;en&s;ibility may be more piercingly exqui&s;ite than ours, are neverthele&s;s much readier to conquer the remem|brance of misfortune: they feel more deeply indeed at fir&s;t; but from the o&s;ier-like pliability of their minds, the moment the fir&s;t hurry of the tempe&s;t is &s;u&s;tained, they gradually ri&s;e to their former &s;ituation; the angui&s;h inpercep|tibly &s;oftens from affliction into melan|choly, from melancholy into languor, and from languor into tranquility: whereas, the ma&s;culine mind, like the oak in the fable, is &s;hattered in the &s;everity of a conflict, when it might ea&s;ily have re|covered the mo&s;t violent &s;hock by a happy facility in bending. This re|mark,
<PB N="119" REF="127">
Charles, is not the con&s;equence of an idle &s;peculation.

On this account, therefore, I flatter my&s;elf, that Mi&s;s Mildmay's un|ea&s;ine&s;s will very &s;peedily wear off, e&s;pecially as her &s;ecret will re&s;t in a

<HEAD>LETTER IX. <HI>Mr.</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>to Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not know how it is, Harold, but, notwith&s;tanding my general di&s;re|gard of women, you have intere&s;ted me &s;trangely in favour of Mi&s;s Mild|may; and this unaccountable delicacy of your's in breaking off with a lady, merely becau&s;e &s;he has given you the mo&s;t convincing proof of her affection, is what, in my opinion, &s;avours con&s;iderably more of romance than of real under&s;tanding. To embrace a certain mi&s;ery for fear of a misfortune which is never likely to hap|pen, may perhaps, make you the hero of a very pretty novel; but mu&s;t, in actual life, expo&s;e you to the unremit|ing ridicule of every body who is tru&s;t|ed with your &s;ecret: however, as the die

is irrecoverably ca&s;t, and as I do not &s;ee that the generous girl could be pre|vailed upon to have you, were you even to &s;neak back to her father's hou&s;e in as pitiful a manner as you left it, I &s;hall throw away as few of my reflections as po&s;&s;ible, upon a fellow who acts in ma|nife&s;t repugnance to the &s;entiments both of his rea&s;on and his honour; and is willing to become a ra&s;cal in the eyes of the wi&s;e and the worthy, for fear the ignorant or the profligate &s;hould &s;et him down as a fool.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the de&s;ire of your letter, I had no &s;ooner looked over the con|tents than I &s;et out to your &s;i&s;ter's; but, in&s;tead of being immediately u&s;hered up &s;tairs, according to cu&s;tom, the &s;ervant told me that his lady had been exce&s;&s;ive|ly ill the whole day, and given orders again&s;t the admittance of any vi&s;itors: "however, Sir," &s;ays the hone&s;t man,
<Q><PB N="123" REF="131">as it is you, I'll call Mrs. Harper, her lady&s;hip's woman, who will probably give you a more &s;atisfactory an&s;wer</Q></P>
<P>Harper accordingly came down to me; and, with a look of mingled grief and impatience, a&s;ked me if you were come to town? I replied in the nega|tive, and enquired, if I might not &s;peak a word or two with her lady.
<Q>Yes to be &s;ure, Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, though I do not believe &s;he would &s;ee any other per&s;on in the kingdom.</Q>
On this &s;he led me up &s;tairs, and there I found your &s;i&s;ter with a letter before her, which &s;he afterwards informed me came from Mrs. Mildmay. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that lady Haver&s;ham had been weeping much, her eyes were prodigiou&s;ly &s;well|ed; and there was an uncommon pale|ne&s;s over her whole face, which &s;uffi|ciently indicated both indi&s;po&s;ition and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="132">You know how little &s;he &s;tands upon ceremony with me&mdash;&s;he pointed there|fore to a chair near her own, and waving with her hand to Harper, as a &s;ignal to withdraw, &s;he bur&s;t into a violent flood of tears. As I had but too much rea&s;on to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of her perturbation, and was &s;en&s;ible that talking in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would only add to her affliction, I waited without ever opening my lips till &s;he had &s;omewhat recovered her&s;elf, and was a little able to enter upon a conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>After her tears had procured her &s;ome relief, &s;he turned to me with an air of un&s;peakable dejection, and cry'd,

But tell me, Sir, has he &s;ent you an account of particulars, has he made you acquainted with every thing?</Q></P>
<P>I again bowed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"And well, Mr. Melmoth," &s;ays &s;he,
<Q>what can we do to &s;ave his life; to &s;ave the honour of the dear unhappy
<PB N="126" REF="134">
girl, and to re&s;tore the peace of a worthy, innocent family?</Q></P>
<P>I replied, that you were &s;till at Reading, and would remain there for a day or two; that I was convinced nobody had &s;o great an influence over you as her lady&s;hip; and advi&s;ed her to exert that influence in &s;uch a man|ner as &s;he &s;hould judge mo&s;t condu|cive to tho&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>"Ay, but, Sir," interrupted lady Ha|ver&s;ham,
<Q>do you know that poor Mi&s;s Mildmay is turned out of doors; that &s;he is now a wanderer, an out|ca&s;t from her father's hou&s;e; and that her di&s;grace mu&s;t inevitably become public before any letter or me&s;&s;age can po&s;&s;ibly reach him? Her unhappy mother &s;ends me a bleeding account of particulars. I &s;uppo&s;e, after your cruel friend had quitted the hou&s;e,
<PB N="127" REF="135">
Mi&s;s Mildmay, between her con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s on account of the pa&s;t, and her de&s;pair on account of the future, revealed the whole matter to the ve|nerable lady. Here, Mr. Melmoth; we keep no &s;ecrets from you; here is Mrs. Mildmay's letter; and, if you can read it with dry eyes, you have either more philo&s;ophy or le&s;s feeling than I could wi&s;h any per&s;on, whom I really regard, to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>I took the letter, and &s;hall not &s;cruple to acknowledge that I cried very hear|tily at &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages. The elevation of &s;entiment, which the young lady &s;hews in never once attempting to upbraid you, though &s;he had &s;uch an undoubted occa&s;ion for reproach, gives me a very favourable idea of her character; and the genero&s;ity of her &s;elf-accu&s;ation, is &s;uch an argument in &s;up|port of her candour, as mu&s;t, I think, entirely remove tho&s;e unmanly appre|hen&s;ions
<PB N="128" REF="136">
upon which you grounded your rejection.</P>
<P>Though I am by many years the olde&s;t man, you know the &s;ex infinitely better than I, and know al&s;o better than I what is e&s;&s;ential to the promotion of your own happine&s;s; yet, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, my dear Harold, I think you ex|ce&s;&s;ively in fault. Through the whole of Mi&s;s Mildmay's behaviour, there has been much tenderne&s;s, but no levity; and her error was an exce&s;s of love, not a vehemence of con&s;titution: had it been the latter, like the generality of women, &s;he would have kept her &s;ecret to her&s;elf; or meanly crouched under your indignities, in &s;uch a manner as had prevented the likelihood of a &s;eparation; but &s;till alive to the &s;harpe&s;t nicety of &s;entiment, &s;he neither could &s;toop to put up with an in&s;ult to retain you; nor, when a &s;eparation took place, at|tempt
<PB N="129" REF="137">
to conceal, by any duplicity of conduct, the fatal occa&s;ion of her lo&s;s. In what&s;oever light I view her conduct, I &s;ee a woman of exalted principle, though I find that woman unhappily in love, and in love with a fellow too, who, in&s;tead of making any allowances on account of her pa&s;&s;ion, makes u&s;e of that very pa&s;&s;ion as an argument for in|volving her in equal di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>I have here, at lady Haver&s;ham's re|que&s;t, enclo&s;ed Mrs. Mildmay's letter; as your &s;i&s;ter is, in con&s;equence of this unhappy affair, &s;o very much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he doubts her own ability to write to day; &s;he has charged me, however, in her name, to tell you, that, with all her tenderne&s;s for you, if you give up Mi&s;s Mildmay, you mu&s;t give up her al&s;o: &s;he con&s;iders her&s;elf as a partner in the injury, which that unfortunate
<PB N="130" REF="138">
young lady has &s;u&s;tained; and is, be|&s;ides apprehen&s;ive of tho&s;e con&s;equences which naturally re&s;ult from the di&s;ho|nour of a con&s;iderable family&mdash;You under&s;tand me&mdash;Colonel Mildmay and you, mu&s;t inevitably have a meeting; and though I know you as &s;ucce&s;sful in in your weapons, and am &s;en&s;ible you have as much courage, as any man in England, it mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be a di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tance to a man of your &s;en&s;ibility, to expo&s;e Mr. Mildmay's hou&s;e to fre&s;h misfortunes; when the injury which you have already done it, exceeds the power of reparation.</P>
<P>Before matters, therefore, come to ex|tremities, I could wi&s;h, for your own &s;ake, for your &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake, for my &s;ake, for every body's &s;ake, you would in|&s;tantly come up to London, and endea|vour at a reconciliation with Mi&s;s Mild|may: a woman who loves you to di|&s;traction,
<PB N="131" REF="139">
can &s;carcely refu&s;e you a pardon for any offence, e&s;pecially as the grant of that pardon will be an e&s;&s;ential means of promoting her own happine&s;s, and pre&s;erving the honour of her family. You &s;ee, by her mother's letter, where &s;he is to be; and, if you have either a pa&s;&s;ion for her, an affection for your &s;i&s;ter, a friend&s;hip for me, or a regard for your&s;elf, you will immediately com|ply with &s;o rea&s;onable a reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Were we to weigh the force of your pre&s;ent objection to Mi&s;s Mildmay in a proper &s;cale, it would appear &s;o a&s;toni&s;h|ingly trifling, that you your&s;elf mu&s;t won|der how you ever gave it any con&s;idera|tion. You are only <HI>fearful</HI> of being mi&s;e|rable, you &s;ay, if you marry Mi&s;s Mild|may; yet you prefer the real mi&s;ery of giving her up, and involving the be&s;t of &s;i&s;ter's, and a whole innocent family, in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, rather than run the
<PB N="132" REF="140">
<HI>chance</HI> of an imaginary misfortune: is this a proceeding con&s;i&s;tent with that good &s;en&s;e, which, in &s;pite of all your faults, I mu&s;t allow you; putting even every motive of genero&s;ity, friend&s;hip, and humanity entirely out of the que&s;tion? Indeed, Sir Robert, the an&s;wer is greatly to your di&s;advantage; and, was I le&s;s acquainted with the extent of your abi|lities, I &s;hould be apt to form &s;uch opinions as would do no great credit to your under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to inform you, that Mrs. Mildmay has &s;ent up the jewels which you pre&s;ented to her amia|ble daughter, when there was &s;uch a likelihood of a happy union between the two families&mdash;your &s;i&s;ter actually &s;obbed when &s;he mentioned them; and, in my hearing, ordered Harper to lock them up in &s;ome place where &s;he might never have an opportunity of &s;eeing them.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="141">This letter, my dear Harold, is very long and very dull; but the anxiety in which I labour on your account, and the long train of evils which I fore&s;ee, &s;hould you fooli&s;hly neglect the advice which I have here given you, totally incapacitates me from attending either to method or connection; but what have I to do with method or connection in letters of friend&s;hip?

<HEAD>LETTER X. <HI>Lady</HI> HAVERSHAM <HI>to Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not know in what form to begin a letter, where I heartily de&s;pi&s;e the the per&s;on to whom I write; nor how to think of calling any body by the tender name of brother, whom rea&s;on and ju&s;tice oblige me to dete&s;t as a man; yet the powerful voice of nature &s;ubdues both my contempt and my in|dignation, and leads me on to try what can po&s;&s;ibly be done to pre&s;erve his life and his character, before a publication of his infamy expo&s;es him to inevitable danger and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Sir, that, by in&s;inuat|ing an apprehen&s;ion about your per&s;onal &s;afety, I want to intimidate you into the
<PB N="135" REF="143">
practice of honour or humanity. I know too well, from the many broils in which you have been already engaged on account of your profligacy, that a man of violence receives additional courage from the appearance of danger; and frequently thinks him&s;elf obliged to &s;ilence every dictate both of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, le&s;t his bravery &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;malle&s;t imputation; &s;uch a man I know you to be; and am &s;atisfied that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, you will &s;ooner think of ju&s;tifying the infamy of your conduct, than dream of reparation; yet, Bob, by all the tenderne&s;s of our near relation, I conjure you to hear me this once with attention, as it is probably the la&s;t time I &s;hall ever trouble you with my cen|&s;ures, or in&s;ult you with my advice.</P>
<P>And tell we really, is it thus I am to be repaid for all my &s;olicitude about your happine&s;s? Is the family I mo&s;t valued,
<PB N="136" REF="144">
to be di&s;honoured&mdash;the young lady whom I mo&s;t loved, to be de&s;troyed&mdash;and my own peace of mind to be eter|nally &s;acrificed, becau&s;e I have, with an anxiety which few &s;i&s;ters ever felt to &s;uch a degree, been attentive to the mi|nute&s;t circum&s;tance that could either improve your fortune, or encrea&s;e your felicity? Is the &s;i&s;ter, for whom you profe&s;s &s;o cordial an affection, the chief per&s;on marked out for the exerci&s;e of your cruelty; and the friends who were deare&s;t to her in the world, the princi|pal people whom you could think of loading with the mo&s;t aggravating di&s;|honour, and the mo&s;t piercing di&s;tre&s;s? O! Bob&mdash;could I have thought this of you!&mdash;Wild as I judged you in general, I believed you a man of &s;entiment at bottom, and could by no means &s;uppo&s;e that, in the un&s;u&s;pecting hour of confi|dence, when the reputation of a con&s;i|derable hou&s;e, and my tranquility, were
<PB N="137" REF="145">
at &s;take, that you would prove the wor&s;t of all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and &s;tab them both to the heart. The day after to-morrow, Bob, I had &s;et apart as the mo&s;t for|tunate of my life; but, alas! I am now to mark it only with my tears, and to lament it as the primary &s;ource of all my pre&s;ent afflictions.</P>
<P>Your friend, Mr. Melmoth, has ju&s;t left me; and, though I believ'd I &s;hould not be able to write in the aggravated di&s;tre&s;s of a real indi&s;po&s;ition, and an unexpected calamity; neverthele&s;s my heart is too full to be &s;ilent; and, when I con&s;ider not only what has happened but what is likely to re&s;ult from this melan|choly affair, I am fearful of lo&s;ing a &s;ingle moment till I try whether there may be not yet a po&s;&s;ibility of bringing an accommodation about, and prevent|ing the pre&s;ent misfortune from produc|ing any additional cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="146">Mr. Melmoth, who loves you with the mo&s;t friendly affection, has &s;hewn me what you wrote to him in con&s;e|quence of this unhappy affair; and I find, that, notwith&s;tanding the infamy of your conduct on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, you are yet candid enough on the other, to aim at no palliations. I am plea&s;ed to &s;ee you generous, though I bleed to find you guilty; and am &s;till in hopes that this latent ember of principle may be fanned into &s;omething that will yet light us on to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the whole cour&s;e of your narrative you have but one objection to Mi&s;s Mildmay, and that is even grounded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition no le&s;s ungenerous than unju&s;t. You men, however, have very contracted notions on the&s;e occa|&s;ions; and generally give up that very vanity, where a lady has &s;hewn any fatal proofs of her regard, which fir&s;t of all
<PB N="139" REF="147">
leads you to think of gaining her af|fections. As long as &s;he keeps you at a di&s;tance you think your&s;elves the only objects whom &s;he can ever honour with her approbation; but if, in the ungard|ed fulne&s;s of heart, &s;he &s;hould unfortu|nately lo&s;e &s;ight of her circum&s;pection, and &s;acrifice her honour through an ex|travagant tenderne&s;s, that moment you &s;ink in your own opinion; that moment you con&s;true what is the con&s;equence of an unbounded partiality for your&s;elves, into a levity of &s;entiment, and imagine every body el&s;e mu&s;t be indulged with an equal degree of familiarity.</P>
<P>You, brother, who have &s;o fine a per|&s;on, and &s;o fini&s;hed an addre&s;s, would think it &s;trange if any body was to tell you, with a grave face, that you were utterly unable to engage a lady's affec|tions; yet why may not you &s;uppo&s;e that it was the influence which you had
<PB N="140" REF="148">
over Mi&s;s Mildmay's heart, that drew her into this unhappy mi&s;take&mdash;Had &s;he been actuated by any illiberal levity of &s;entiment, do you imagine that &s;he would have continued, through the mo&s;t trying &s;tages of a young woman's life, from &s;ixteen up to twenty-one, without mak|ing any lap&s;e injurious to her reputation? Do you &s;uppo&s;e that, &s;urrounded with admirers, and every day &s;olicited by &s;ome of the fine&s;t young fellows in the kingdom, &s;he would not have fallen a victim to a vehemence of con&s;titution? Undoubtedly &s;he would; but con&s;titu|tion had nothing at all to do in her cha|racter. You know I have been intimate in her family from her infancy, though you became acquainted with her &s;o lately; and my re&s;idence, during lord Haver&s;ham's life, upon the very &s;pot with her, gave me numberle&s;s opportu|nities of knowing her thoroughly&mdash;In all this time, there never was a young
<PB N="141" REF="149">
lady who behaved with a nicer rectitude of conduct, that had &s;o many admirers; and you may be &s;ure, if I had not the be&s;t opinion in the world, both of her head and her heart, I &s;hould not have been &s;o de&s;irous of having her for a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>So far, in reality, was Mi&s;s Mildmay from an indi&s;creet girl, that I place no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of her ruin down to the account of her virtue. When &s;he grew old enough to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the addre&s;&s;es of the men, &s;he always made me her confidant; and often, upon my a&s;king her what objection &s;he could have to &s;uch or &s;uch a per&s;on, &s;he would reply,
<Q>My dear lady Haver|&s;ham, the men are well enough to be &s;ure, and &s;o are their e&s;tates; but I don't find any thing peculiarly &s;triking in their characters.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150">As it was impo&s;&s;ible but what, in the cour&s;e of our intimacy, I &s;hould fre|quently talk of you, and dwell, with all the partiality of a &s;i&s;ter, upon &s;uch of your actions as I thought worthy of ap|probation; Loui&s;a would li&s;ten with a fixed attention; would declare you were a charming fellow; and wi&s;h that her papa could be prevailed upon to tru&s;t her up with me to town, or that the wildne&s;s of your di&s;po&s;ition would per|mit you to make a vi&s;it to the country&mdash;She longed, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ee you, and begged I would contrive to bring you together; but I don't know how it was, though I tried &s;everal times, &s;ome accident or other &s;till happened to defeat my intentions. Matters went on in this manner for &s;ome time, till the very ge|nerous part which you acted by farmer Jenkins, who had been thrown into goal for a con&s;iderable &s;um by his land|lord, on account of re&s;enting an unbe|coming
<PB N="143" REF="151">
liberty with his daughter. As I was really charmed with the action my|&s;elf, I told it to every body, and fir&s;t of all I believe to Loui&s;a; when &s;he heard that you were totally unintere&s;ted in the affair, that Jenkins was an hone&s;t worthy poor man; that he had a large family, and was cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed; when &s;he heard that you not only paid all his debts, but even portioned out his daughter, and all this without being ever &s;een by any individual of the poor fellow's family; Loui&s;a could not with|&s;tand her emotion&mdash;She breathed &s;hort; &s;hifted from one &s;ide of her &s;eat to the other; and, at la&s;t, exclaiming that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of bearing any more, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears. Thus totally uninfluenced by pa&s;&s;ion or preju|dice, and entirely actuated by real prin|ciple and genuine benignity, her very goodne&s;s of heart became a material &s;ource of her misfortunes; and laid the
<PB N="144" REF="152">
original foundation of all her pre&s;ent di&s;honour and di&s;tre&s;s. The contracted eye of a narrow-minded libertini&s;m can|not, however, di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e indi&s;cretions which re&s;ult from an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, and an exce&s;s of levity; attentive to one little object it always &s;ees a woman's actions on the lea&s;t fa|vourable &s;ide; and, con&s;cious of its own unworthine&s;s, &s;uppo&s;es that nothing but an equal unworthine&s;s can ever honour it &s;o far as to commit a capital mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But, of all the paltry contrivances which were ever de&s;igned to break off a match, &s;urely your mode of parting with Mi&s;s Mildmay was the mo&s;t ridi|culou&s;ly contemptible&mdash;And &s;o you thought it perfectly &s;ufficient to <HI>&s;ay</HI> you were ready to marry her, at the &s;ame time that by the in&s;olence and cruelty of your artificial humility and concern, you forced her to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="145" REF="153">
rejecting you. As a man of honour you thought it requi&s;ite to declare a willingne&s;s to fulfil your former engage|ments; yet what honourable compunc|tion did you feel, when, in the ba&s;e&s;t op|po&s;ition to your profe&s;&s;ions, you worked the unhappy young lady up to the cut|ing alternative, either of refu&s;ing you, or of meriting to be refu&s;ed her&s;elf? What &s;ignifies the plau&s;ibility of the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion, when our actions give the lye to our words; or what &s;ig|nifies the deepe&s;t air of tenderne&s;s and veneration, if we &s;ecretly carry a dagger to &s;tab the object of all this tenderne&s;s and veneration to the heart? In fact, our hypocri&s;y, &s;o far from alleviating the guilt, &s;erves only to encrea&s;e its in|famy; and indicates nothing more than our fear, or our &s;hame, to perpetrate tho&s;e crimes from which we are are nei|ther detered by the voice of honour nor the &s;en&s;e of humanity: but what has a
<PB N="146" REF="154">
modern fine gentleman to do with honour or humanity! the mere out&s;ides of either are &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e; and, &s;o he ob&s;erves a formal, frigid &s;ort of defer|ence for his word, he becomes equally dead to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his rea&s;on and the feelings of his heart.</P>
<P>Yet if I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the pitiful contrivance by which you obtained your <HI>honourable</HI> di&s;charge from Loui&s;a, what mu&s;t I think of that barbarous mortifi|cation which you expre&s;s at finding &s;he could bear the lo&s;s of a worthle&s;s liber|tine, with &s;uch an exalted &s;hare of for|titude? And &s;o your pride was wounded becau&s;e the unhappy young lady did not di&s;cover a greater &s;hare of wretchedne&s;s, and manife&s;t a much keener &s;en&s;ibility of di&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;O! Bob, Bob, how unmanly, how inhuman is this declaration! But why am I &s;urprized at partial unmanli|ne&s;&s;es, or particular inhumanities, where
<PB N="147" REF="155">
the whole conduct has been uniformly de&s;titute of manhood and humanity. Your behaviour, Sir, is entirely of a piece; and my contempt is as much ex|cited by your pride as my dete&s;tation is rai&s;ed by your barbarity.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, it would have yielded a mo&s;t delicious fea&s;t to your vanity, had Mi&s;s Mildmay fallen at your feet; and, in an agony of de&s;pair, implored you to change your cruel re&s;olution. I &s;uppo&s;e you would have felt the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite gratification to &s;ee the unhappy young lady deluged in her own tears, and tearing her fine face in all the extra|vagance of united grief and di&s;traction&mdash;Thank God, you were di&s;appointed&mdash;Thank God, there is one woman who can &s;purn a worthle&s;s lover from her pre&s;ence, even while &s;he acknowledges his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart. What you may think of the behaviour I know not,
<PB N="148" REF="156">
but, for my own part, her conduct &s;ince her fir&s;t indi&s;cretion has actually rai&s;ed her in my opinion; and the generous &s;en&s;ibility which &s;he has &s;hewn in con&s;e|quence of her error, gives her a prefer|ence to millions who have never erred at all.</P>
<P>Pride, in&s;en&s;ibility, and want of &s;oli|citation, have given a negative degree of excellence to, and pre&s;erved the purity of numbers, who were neither protected by principle nor rea&s;on; but a woman, who, on the eve of marriage with a man &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately loves; a woman, who&s;e heart, by the con&s;ideration of the approaching union, and the exchange of a thou&s;and tender vows that naturally antecede the ceremony, is melted into the &s;ofte&s;t degree of confidence, and thrown totally off its guard; &s;uch a woman, I &s;ay, if, in the un&s;u&s;pecting moment of her &s;oul, &s;he even forgets
<PB N="149" REF="157">
the more rigid, though nece&s;&s;ary, punc|tilioes of behaviour, has infinite extenu|ations to offer in her defence: but if, upon her recovery of recollection, &s;he is capable of acting with dignity and &s;en|timent, the goodne&s;s of her mind I think &s;ufficiently removes the imputation of levity, and renders her greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e who boa&s;t of their own forti|tude, without experiencing the force of the &s;ame temptation.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Bob, have I opened my whole heart to you on this &s;ubject; and, now the only an&s;wer which I either de&s;ire or expect to this letter is, your immediate pre&s;ence in town, to try every po&s;&s;ible means of a reconciliation with Mi&s;s Mildmay&mdash;Don't be afraid of looking mean when you are about the performance of a good action; a blu&s;h upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion will become you mightily; and even in proportion to the
<PB N="150" REF="158">
greatne&s;s of your confu&s;ion I &s;hall be apt to e&s;timate both the benevolence of your heart, and the depth of your un|der&s;tanding: &s;hould you, however, &s;till continue attached to your ridiculous de|licacy, and, through a romantic prin|ciple of pride give up a woman who is in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your heart, you mu&s;t al&s;o give up a &s;i&s;ter who loves you as &s;i&s;ter, perhaps, never loved brother before; for, though I candidly own it will give me the greate&s;t of all di|&s;tre&s;&s;es to di&s;continue &s;uch a corre&s;pond|ence as &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t betweeen two people &s;o united by blood, and &s;o ce|mented by friend&s;hip; yet I po&s;itively repeat, that, unle&s;s you &s;hew your&s;elf a man of principle on this important occa&s;ion, you will never more hear a &s;yllable from your greatly afflicted, yet &s;till affectionate Si&s;ter,</P>

<P>YOU can &s;carcely conceive the anxiety I have laboured under &s;ince my la&s;t letter: every moment that I was ab&s;ent from Loui&s;a, I thought would have enabled me to bani&s;h her from my memory with more readine&s;s and certainty; but, I don't know how it is, &s;he pre&s;&s;es with an ince&s;&s;ant violence to my recollection, and gains every moment an additional &s;hare of power in proportion as I flattered my&s;elf her power would have dimini&s;hed. What an unaccountable fellow am I, Charles, that I never know my own mind for four and twenty hours together! Before I was &s;ure of Mi&s;s Mildmay, I was impatient to
<PB N="152" REF="160">
become ma&s;ter of her affections: when I had obtained the&s;e affections, I in|&s;tantly &s;unk into a &s;tate of indifference and apathy; and for &s;ome time, dread|ed the day of marriage as a condemned criminal would dread the day of execu|cution. Well, having at la&s;t worked my&s;elf up into a real pa&s;&s;ion for her, the intervention of an unexpected cir|cum&s;tance; induced me to give her up and, now that I have given her up, I find I &s;hall be as eager as ever to regain her. The only way I &s;ee, after all, is fairly to marry her; for then, let me change my mind never &s;o often, my per&s;on you know will be bound in &s;uch a manner as to keep me from the com|mi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t this moment received your letter, and my &s;i&s;ter Haver&s;ham's. By the&s;e I find you are endeavouring to imitate, as far as you are capable of imi|tating,
<PB N="153" REF="161">
any thing worthy, the character of Belford in Richard&s;on's Clari&s;&s;a Har|low&mdash;Nay, to render this imitation the more &s;triking, you treat me as if I were ju&s;t &s;uch another contemptible block|head as Lovelace, who did not imagine there was a mode&s;t woman exi&s;ting. Now, you know very well, Melmoth, that I am rather vain in affectation than in reality; and, tho' I &s;ometimes talk away about my per&s;on, and my addre&s;s, you mu&s;t acknowledge that, unlike Richard|&s;on's hero, I never in&s;inuate that either is irre&s;i&s;table. In &s;hort, you know that, even in my wilde&s;t connection with the &s;ex, I &s;till retained &s;ome degree of prin|ciple; and have frequently, from motives of humanity, avoided an intercour&s;e which he would have &s;olicited with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;idulty. Between him and I the compari&s;on is &s;till more remote, for he was continually endeavouring to un|dermine a virtue which he had no
<PB N="154" REF="162">
rea&s;on what&s;oever to &s;u&s;pect; whereas I never entertained a thought injurious to Mi&s;s Mildmay, but &s;ucceeded with her entirely from a trivial accident.&mdash;This is not all; the arts which Lovelace made u&s;e of to trepan Clari&s;&s;a, were to the la&s;t degree infamous and unmanly; his car|rying her to Sinclair's, a common bro|thel, and his introduction of the two &s;trumpets to her in the character of ladies of quality, are more flagrant in|&s;tances of turpitude than if he had ac|tually admini&s;tered a &s;leeping draught, or forced her, the moment he got her from her father's. In the latter ca&s;es, youth and pa&s;&s;ion might afford his crime &s;ome &s;hadow of palliation; whereas, in the former, his &s;chemes are &s;o tedious and refined, that they become utterly repugnant to the fire of youth, and the fury of pa&s;&s;ion; and indicate either the mo&s;t palpable villiany of heart, or the mo&s;t palpable want of inclination.
<PB N="155" REF="163">
His rea&s;on too for delaying to marry the woman he loves is a plea&s;ant one; he fears &s;he is actually virtuous. O! Charles, how oppo&s;ite is the motive of my con|duct; but hu&s;h, recollection! down bu&s;y devil, down&mdash;I have waked a &s;cor|pion in that retro&s;pect, which &s;tings me to di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Your letter, Charles, is, as you ju&s;tly call it, a very dull one; however, you are a happy fellow to make even your &s;tupidity a means of &s;hewing your un|der&s;tanding. My &s;i&s;ter Haver&s;ham, without the advantage of your exten&s;ive erudition, writes fifty times more to the purpo&s;e, though I dare &s;ay you think her infinitely your inferior, both as to elegance of &s;tile and energy of argu|ment. Don't, however, be offended at the ju&s;tice I do her in this place, for you are a mighty favourite with her lady|&s;hip;
<PB N="156" REF="164">
and, I dare &s;ay, may, in time, a&s;pire at a match with her&mdash;Abigail Harper.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e attempts to be merry, I am fearful my endeavours at a joke will be to the full as unfortunate as your endeavours at letter-writing. I &s;hall not, like you, however, make the ridiculous parade of an apology: the bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;crawl is to beg you will in&s;tantly go to lady Haver&s;ham's, and inform her I am every thing &s;he could wi&s;h me&mdash;that I &s;hall &s;et off to-morrow morning for London, and be with her by breakfa&s;t. In the mean time, if &s;he would contrive to &s;ee Loui&s;a, who mu&s;t be in town by this, it would oblige me highly, as I know an interview between them would pave the readie&s;t way to a reconciliation. Perhaps, Mi&s;s Mildmay, when &s;he finds my &s;i&s;ter &s;o &s;trenuous, and &s;ees how ready I am my&s;elf to heal this unlucky breach, may give her&s;elf
<PB N="157" REF="165">
&s;ome airs, and think of treating me with indifference&mdash;If &s;he &s;hould, by Heaven&mdash;Yet, &s;urely, I have de&s;erved not only her indifference, but her &s;corn; have I not cruelly expo&s;ed her to the ridicule of the whole world, and the re&s;entment of her whole family!&mdash;Have I not equally endangered her reputation and her life, de&s;troyed her fortune, and bla&s;ted her felicity!&mdash;Yes, Melmoth, I have de&s;erved not only her &s;corn but her ab&s;olute detete&s;tation. I am a&s;to|ni&s;hed, when I review the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, how I could be weak enough to prefer a number of the mo&s;t affecting evils, to the precarious hazard at wor&s;t of a &s;ingle misfortune. Mrs. Mildmay's letter co&s;t me many tears; and I could not read lady Haver&s;ham's without an equal mixture of &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s; that worthie&s;t, noble&s;t of women, Charles, is entitled to every return both of my gratitude and affection; had it not been
<PB N="158" REF="166">
for her indefatigable indu&s;try, even in oppo&s;ition to the manife&s;t call of her intere&s;t, and the dictates of her love, my father you know, would have di&s;inherited me. Her marriage with lord Haver&s;ham, a man three times older than her&s;elf, was the price of my pardon; and yet, at the &s;ame time that Theodo&s;ia yielded to this match for my pre&s;ervation, I knew her whole &s;oul was devoted to my old friend Sir Edward Wilmington. Poor Sir Ed|ward fell in the glorious affair of Minden; and, though I never hinted the circum&s;tance to you before, yet he &s;acrificed him&s;elf on that memorable day, by running into unnece&s;&s;ary dangers merely through his incapacity to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;And does not this &s;i&s;ter, Melmoth, de&s;erve every thing at my hands?&mdash;Go in&s;tantly to her, when you read this, and tell her, that, for the remainder of my days, I &s;hall be entirely guided by her directions; tell her, that,
<PB N="159" REF="167">
without the continuation of her friend|&s;hip, I never can be happy; and, that next to the forgivene&s;s of the Deity him&s;elf, her's is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential re|qui&s;ite to my felicity. I blu&s;h, Melmoth, to be outdone in genero&s;ity; but this exalted woman always threw me at a di&s;tance; and, from my infancy up, con|tinually excited both my envy and my admiration. You &s;ee, that, in all this readine&s;s of acquie&s;cence, Charles, I never once in&s;inuate the plea&s;ure it will nece&s;&s;arily give my&s;elf to make up mat|ters with Loui&s;a; neverthele&s;s, my heart is tran&s;ported at the thought, and I even love my friends the better for thus taking part again&s;t my pride, in favour of my inclination.</P>
<P>The hints which you in&s;inuate rela|tive to con&s;equences, Charles, in ca&s;e I do not accommodate with the Mildmay family, would give me but little un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="160" REF="168">
was I ever &s;o pitiful a paltroon, and ever &s;o much di&s;inclined to the match. Colonel Mildmay is a young fellow of &s;pirit, but he is al&s;o a man of under&s;tanding; he mu&s;t therefore &s;ee how prepo&s;terous it would be to think of revenging the quarrel of a &s;i&s;ter, who, notwith&s;tanding my behaviour, would, I dare &s;ay, be much better plea&s;|ed at his fall than mine; I have been more than once challenged by the bro|thers of young ladies, Charles; and I always found the dear girls thought the fellows extremely impertinent who pre&s;umed to call me to an account. There are few &s;i&s;ters, Melmoth, like lady Haver&s;ham; on the contrary, mo&s;t women would much &s;ooner wi&s;h to &s;ee a brother &s;tretched dead upon the field of combat, than to hear that an infa|mous ra&s;cal, who had de&s;troyed both their peace and their reputation, had met with the &s;malle&s;t accident. For my
<PB N="161" REF="169">
own part, dearly as I love lady Haver|&s;ham, was it po&s;&s;ible for her to be ruin|ed and de&s;erted, I &s;hould never think of calling the villain to an account&mdash;After the la&s;t intimacy, a woman always e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of her lover, and a brother has of cour&s;e little occa&s;ion to interfere, when, at the very moment he is hazarding his life in the cau&s;e of a &s;i&s;ter, &s;he is &s;ecretly praying for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his antagoni&s;t. Colonel Mild|may knows the world, and will never dream of expo&s;ing his life in a quarrel where there is no probability even of meeting with thanks. Be ea&s;y therefore, dear Charles, on this head, and believe me to be your's unalterably.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. <HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT HAROLD <HI>to</HI> CHARLES MELMOTH, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BRISTOL.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will undoubtedly be &s;urprized, (after reading the firm re&s;olution which I made in my la&s;t, of going in|&s;tantly to London, and accommodating the unhappy affair with Mi&s;s Mildmay,) to hear that, in&s;tead of following that re&s;olution, I am this moment preparing to quit the kingdom; and &s;hall, in all probability, never more &s;ee Loui&s;a's face, nor &s;et a foot in England. O! Charles, to what a fate am I re&s;erved; one mi&s;|fortune treads fa&s;t upon the heels of another; and the worthy, though mi&s;|guided, colonel Mildmay, is perhaps, by
<PB N="163" REF="171">
this time, dead through a ra&s;h indigna|tion at the fate of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t &s;tepping into my chai&s;e at the Crown in Reading, when a gentle|man in a po&s;t-chariot and &s;ix, who was driving at a furious rate, accidentally &s;eeing me, ordered his people to &s;top; and coming out of the carriage &s;lapped me familiary upon the &s;houlder, and expre&s;&s;ed no little a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing me in Reading; &s;aying, he thought I had been con&s;iderably better employed than in driving round the country. The meeting was an unluckily one, Charles, for the gentleman was no other than co|lonel Mildmay; he was going down to his father's to be pre&s;ent at my marriage with Loui&s;a, and now de&s;ired me to &s;tep into his carriage, as it would be much more agreeable to ride together than to travel in &s;eparate vehicles.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="172">You may be &s;ure, that, if the unex|pected appearance of the colonel di&s;|concerted me at fir&s;t, my confu&s;ion was no way abated by the propo&s;al of ac|companying him to his father's; I was exce&s;&s;ively aukward, and made &s;ome &s;tammering &s;ort of a reply, which I fan|cy rendered me cur&s;edly contemptible. The colonel perceiving me &s;o much em|barra&s;&s;ed, demanded, with a faltering tone, and a look of the utmo&s;t appre|hen&s;ion, if all was right, and if I &s;till continued on a proper footing with Loui&s;a. This que&s;tion was a home one, Melmoth; and to evade it would have been the lowe&s;t degree of timidity; I therefore hinted, that a little acccident had intervened, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion a &s;hort procra&s;tination of our nuptials, but that I had no doubt of every thing's being &s;ettled to the mu|tual &s;atisfaction of both families.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="173">This reply threw the colonel into the greate&s;t con&s;ternation; his brows were in an in&s;tant &s;tretched a full inch above their natural &s;ituation; his eyes were fixed into a &s;tare of unutterable a&s;toni&s;h|ment; his mouth in&s;en&s;ibly widened to a horror of di&s;tention; and his com|plexion, which the moment before was remarkably glowing, now a&s;&s;umed a white of the mo&s;t deadly kind imagi|nable; at la&s;t, with an accent &s;carce au|dible, while a tear imperceptibly &s;tole down his cheek, he de&s;ired me to &s;tep into the inn with him, and in&s;inuated that he expected to be made acquainted with the particulars: I accordingly a|&s;cented to his propo&s;al; and a private room being ordered, we went up &s;tairs together, and for &s;ome moments &s;at in a &s;tate of &s;ilent anxiety, each expecting that the other would open fir&s;t, while each neverthele&s;s dreaded to enter upon a conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">The colonel, however, finding that I was no way likely to begin the di&s;|cour&s;e, and naturally recollecting that, as he had been the propo&s;er of the intended explanation, it became him to break &s;ilence, he exclaimed with an interrogatory repetition,
<Q>And &s;o, Sir Robert, an affair has happened, which mu&s;t inevitably delay your marriage with Loui&s;a?</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Yes, colonel, and I &s;incerely lament the occa&s;ion of that delay, as I flattered my&s;elf with a hope of being the happie&s;t man in the world a little earlier.</Q>
<Q>As you are kind enough to lament the occa&s;ion of this delay,</Q>
replied the colonel,
<Q>you can have no objection to make me acquainted with it&mdash;Shall I therefore beg, Sir Robert, to know the real motive of procra&s;tinating matters? From the very great expedi|tion u&s;ed in the former part of this negotiation, a delay was what I little
<PB N="167" REF="175">
looked for, and mu&s;t confe&s;s that it not only &s;urprizes but affects me&mdash;Loui&s;a, Sir Robert, is very near my heart, and our's is a family which mu&s;t not be in&s;ulted with impunity.</Q></P>
<P>You may naturally imagine, Charles, that this menacing &s;peech, together with the air which accompanied it, was not at all calculated to work upon a temper like mine; I therefore &s;urveyed the colonel with a look of cold indif|ference, and an&s;wered, that Loui&s;a was to the full as clo&s;e to my heart as &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly be to his; and as for re|&s;enting any in&s;ult which might be offer|ed to the honour of his family, that was a circum&s;tance which mu&s;t rai&s;e him in every body's con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>From the vi&s;ible coldne&s;s of my re|ply, the colonel, I &s;aw, endeavoured to rein in his temper, as well as he was
<PB N="168" REF="176">
able, till he had more &s;ub&s;tantial grounds for indicating a re&s;entment.
<Q>Sir Robert,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>excu&s;e my warmth&mdash;I love my &s;i&s;ter, and I feel for my family&mdash;gratify my impatience there|fore in one word, and, like the man of honour I believe you to be, like the brother I hope to find you, tell me that neither has been injured by your means and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t man in the univer&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Here, Melmoth, was a lunge which required all my ingenuity to parry; yet, when I con&s;idered that Loui&s;a her&s;elf had publi&s;hed every thing be|tween us, and when I &s;aw the colonel mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hear the whole &s;tory in the mo&s;t aggravating light in a few hours, I thought it would look like the ranke&s;t cowardice to prevaricate, however it might wound my &s;en&s;ibility in the tendere&s;t part to make mention
<PB N="169" REF="177">
of any thing to the di&s;advantage of Loui&s;a. Putting therefore the be&s;t face I po&s;&s;ibly could upon the matter, I candidly told the colonel, that the ex|ce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter had ac|tually led me into an indi&s;cretion which occa&s;ioned &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; that Loui&s;a had, in con&s;equence, been &s;ent up to London, and that I was then on my journey after her, to fall at her feet, and to &s;olicit a reconciliation.&mdash;I added, that I flattered my&s;elf he would exert his intere&s;t in my favour, &s;ince there was no undoing what was done; and &s;ince that was the only means of re&s;toring his &s;i&s;ter's tranquility, and &s;ecuring the ho|nour of his family.</P>
<P>There is no po&s;&s;ibility, Melmoth, of painting the a&s;toni&s;hment in which this relation threw the colonel; the &s;urprize which he before manife&s;ted was nothing to that which now took the entire po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="170" REF="178">
of his countenance&mdash;At length, his wonder giving way to his indigna|tion, a kind of fury &s;eemed to fla&s;h from his eyes, and he fiercely leaned acro&s;s the table, repeating, in a menac|ing accent,
<Q>And &s;o, Sir, you have actually ruined Loui&s;a Mildmay!</Q></P>
<P>I don't know how it is, Melmoth, but there is &s;omething in the nature of guilt which takes away our fortitude, and re|duces us to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t con|temptible timidity. You know I have as much courage as the generality of young fellows, and you know al&s;o what unhappy in&s;tances I have given of my knowledge in the weapons; yet, by all that's good, I could &s;carcely &s;u&s;tain the the terror of Mildmay's eye on this occa&s;ion&mdash;con&s;cious how much right he had to be offended. Con&s;cious of my own guilt, and lady Haver&s;ham's letter &s;till ringing in my years, I &s;hrunk in a
<PB N="171" REF="179">
manner into my&s;elf, and &s;eemed fearful of encountering the &s;hock of his indig|nation. I &s;at dumb&mdash;irre&s;olute&mdash;con|founded&mdash;my vacant eye held rivetted to the floor, and &s;uch a vi&s;ible agitation in my whole per&s;on as would have given the colonel but a poor idea of my &s;pirit, had he not been already pretty well ac|quainted with my character. The co|lonel, however, &s;oon gave me all my cu&s;tomary courage, by exclaiming that I was a villain, a cowardly, contemptible villain, who had ba&s;ely made u&s;e of the mo&s;t infamous arts to &s;educe the inexpe|rienced innocence of a beautiful young lady, and to bla&s;t the reputation of a fa|mily, with which I was utterly unworthy to be connected. The colonel was pro|ceeding in this manner, and giving an unbounded loo&s;e to a &s;torm of incohe|rent fury, when I interrupted him,&mdash;"Colonel," &s;ays I,
<Q>this is language with which I have been totally unac|quainted;
<PB N="172" REF="180">
and it is language which would po&s;&s;ibly co&s;t you very dear, was I not &s;en&s;ible you have &s;ome cau&s;e to be offended with me; and, was I not de&s;irous of &s;hewing every regard which I am now able to manife&s;t, both for the honour of your family and the peace of your beautiful &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I grant my behaviour has been cul|pable, greatly culpable, and it is with infinite concern I reflect on the anxiety which my mi&s;behaviour has already produced&mdash;What more can I either &s;ay or do? An altercation between you and I is much more likely to en|crea&s;e the general unhappine&s;s of our friends than to remove it. You know, that, &s;hould it even be my lot to fall in this altercation, neither your hou&s;e nor your &s;i&s;ter can be benefitted by that circum&s;tance; whereas, on the contrary, &s;hould you be un&s;ucce&s;sful, both mu&s;t naturally experience an
<PB N="173" REF="181">
addition of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Do me the ju&s;tice, colonel Mildmay, to believe, that this expo&s;tulation is not the re&s;ult of timidity&mdash;I have al|ready injured your hou&s;e, and it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity indeed which can oblige me to run even the hazard of aggravating my fault.&mdash;Do not, therefore, by indulging an injudi|cious warmth, either prevent me from the po&s;&s;ibility of making a reparation, or expo&s;e your family to the hazard of new misfortunes. Happine&s;s is yet within our reach, and it mu&s;t be very much your fault if it is &s;natched from our hands.</Q></P>
<P>This long harangue, Charles, I pro|nounced with an uncommon degree of temper; but I could ea&s;ily &s;ee that it had little effect upon colonel Mildmay; full of that ridiculous &s;ort of honour which is above li&s;tening to rea&s;on, he
<PB N="174" REF="182">
endeavoured to break in upon me &s;eve|ral times; and, when I had done, in&s;tead of moderating his pa&s;&s;ion, he rather &s;eemed to give it an additional force; &s;wearing that, though a cool hypocritical &s;peech might &s;ilence the re&s;entment of his &s;i&s;ter, he was not to be duped from his purpo&s;e by the mo&s;t &s;pecious plau&s;ibilities; but would vindicate the honour of his family, and proceed in|&s;tantly to the nece&s;&s;ary means of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>"And pray, colonel," &s;ays I,
<Q>how do you purpo&s;e to obtain this re|dre&s;s?</Q>
"Purpo&s;e," returned he &s;hortly,
<Q>as a man of honour&mdash;Be plea&s;ed to &s;tay for me but two minutes and you &s;hall be more fully &s;atisfied.</Q>
So &s;aying, he ran down &s;tairs to his chariot, which was all the time waiting at the door, and took out a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, (for I could &s;ee every thing di&s;tinctly through the window.) The&s;e
<PB N="175" REF="183">
he concealed under a &s;urtout, which he had on; and coming up with a light|ning-like expedition, to the room in which he left me, entered and bolted the door. Having done thus, he marched up directly to me, and &s;wore, with a determined energy of execration, that, unle&s;s I in&s;tantly accepted of one, and &s;tood upon my defence, he would, without any farther ceremony, &s;hoot me through the head. All this time, Charles, I kept my temper with a &s;toici&s;m that that was really a&s;toni&s;hing&mdash;"Colonel," &s;ays I, as he pronounced the la&s;t me|nace,
<Q>con&s;ider that you have a man before you who is not ea&s;ily intimi|dated; but who, as he wi&s;hes to re|pair, in&s;tead of aggravating injuries, is willing to overlook the in&s;ults which you have offered him, and to embrace you as a brother and a friend.&mdash;For your &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake, Sir, con&s;ider.</Q>
&mdash;"Damnation &s;eize my &s;i&s;ter," interrupt|ed
<PB N="176" REF="184">
he, wildly,
<Q>it is not her honour which I want to vindicate, but my own&mdash;She is an infamous &s;trumpet, and you are a cowardly, hypocritical &s;coundrel&mdash;take the pi&s;tol, Sir,&mdash;this moment take it and defend your&s;elf; for, by all that's holy, if you he&s;itate another in&s;tant, I will anticipate the ju&s;tice of the gibbet, and rid the world of as great a villain as ever di&s;honour|ed it.</Q>
This language, Charles, was no longer to be borne; the &s;candalous epithet with which he had branded poor Loui&s;a, and the brutality of in&s;olence with which he treated all my conce&s;&s;ions, entirely de&s;troyed my fortitude; &s;o that now forgetting every con&s;ideration, I &s;natch|ed the pi&s;tol out of his hand, and re|tiring to a &s;pace, which he him&s;elf had pointed out, I fired, and wounded him &s;o dangerou&s;ly in the groin, that he in|&s;tantly fell upon the floor, di&s;charging his pi&s;tol; however, as he fell, the contents

of which ju&s;t drew a little blood from my ear, but did me no farther injury, unle&s;s burning a curl of the &s;ide hair may be termed an injury to a fellow &s;o fond of dre&s;&s;ing as your humble &s;ervant.</P>
<P>I ran to the colonel the moment I &s;aw him down, and offered him every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in my power; but he was now in a manner frantic; the angui&s;h of his wound, and the mortification of finding I had come off &s;o ea&s;ily, threw him into an extravagant pa&s;&s;ion, and he raved at me, his &s;i&s;ter, and his own unexecuting hand, with all the fury of an implacable re&s;entment, and a di&s;appointed revenge; di&s;claiming every con&s;olation which I was capable of offering, and &s;wearing he would &s;till pur&s;ue me to the utmo&s;t con|fines of the world till he had &s;acrificed me to the manes of his murdered re|putation. Finding him in this temper,
<PB N="178" REF="186">
and knowing that the &s;ooner I provided for my own &s;afety the better, as I found from the nature of his wound that his &s;ituation was dangerous, I marched down &s;tairs to my chai&s;e with my hand|kerchief to my ear, and drove immedi|ately off towards Bri&s;tol, giving previ|ous directions, however, to the people of the hou&s;e, who had not yet been alarmed, to take the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual care of the colonel.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t care on my arrival at Bri&s;tol, was to &s;end Edwards in que&s;t of &s;ome ve&s;&s;el immediately ready to &s;ail, and in le&s;s than an hour he came back with intelligence that the captain of a &s;hip bound to Rotterdam, was prepar|ing to &s;et off the next tide. As it was a matter of indifference to me which way I pur&s;ued my rout, I ordered him to agree with the Dutchman, and &s;at down to give you an account of this

unfortunate accident before I left the kingdom. You cannot imagine, Charles, how mi&s;erable it has made me&mdash;No le&s;s in di&s;appointing the eagerne&s;s of my wi&s;hes to be reconciled to Loui&s;a, than in loading the two families with addi|tional di&s;tre&s;s; neither lady Haver&s;ham, nor Mi&s;s Mildmay will ever believe but what I have been entirely to blame in this cur&s;t rencounter; and &s;hould the colonel even recover, the danger into which I have thrown his life, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily impede an accommodation with his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Then he is &s;o implacable in his re&s;entments, and his father is &s;o carried away by the ridiculous notions of family reputation, that I much que&s;tion whe|ther he would not believe him&s;elf rather bound in honour to treat me with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t indignities, than to think of li&s;tening to any overtures which I may make towards a reconciliation. How cautiou&s;ly my dear Melmoth, &s;hould

young fellows of any principle be in their conduct to women of character; &s;ince a &s;ingle indi&s;cretion can be pro|ductive of &s;uch numberle&s;s misfortunes. Here have I with as little villainy of intention as ever influenced the bo&s;om of giddy headed youth; with little more in fact to charge my&s;elf than a mere want of circum&s;pection, de&s;troyed the reputation of a woman whom I pa&s;|&s;ionately love; converted the &s;miling expectations of her whole family into angui&s;h and di&s;grace; robbed her bro|ther, perhaps, of his life; and &s;acrificed not only my own peace of mind for ever, but covered all my friends with confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s. How &s;ome peo|ple, Melmoth, can pre&s;erve their tran|quility with &s;uch a &s;cene before them is to me a&s;toni&s;hing. A man not utterly dive&s;ted of feeling, mu&s;t look with horror on him&s;elf where he has been the cau&s;e of &s;uch a complicated wretchedne&s;s.

For my own part, thoughtle&s;s as I have been in many connections with the &s;ex, the con&s;equences which have re&s;ulted from this affair with Mi&s;s Mildmay, makes me dete&s;t what I formerly e&s;teemed the prin|cipal &s;ource of felicity; and convinces me that a man of gallantry is no le&s;s a contemptible than a dangerous character. O! Charles, could my whole fortune re|cover that chearful &s;erenity of mind which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a week ago, how readily would I think of making the purcha&s;e; but happine&s;s is totally in|compatible with guilt, and it is but ju&s;t that he who is in&s;trumental in the mi&s;ery of others &s;hould experience the &s;harpe&s;t &s;tings of mi&s;ery him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this letter, I mu&s;t, however, mention &s;ome things to you relative to Mi&s;s Mildmay. By her mother's letter I under&s;tand, that &s;he is to be &s;upplied with money only as the good old lady can conveniently &s;pare it,

till time can &s;o work upon the ob&s;tinate temper of her father, as to obtain &s;ome regular allowance for her e&s;tabli&s;hment; all &s;he has in the world is five hundred pounds; this is but a &s;mall &s;um for a lady of her fa&s;hion to live upon a whole year, tho' I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he will not in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances choo&s;e to be very public; however, that &s;he may &s;uffer as little as po&s;&s;ible upon my account, con|trive through lady Haver&s;ham's means &s;ome method of making the dear girl receive a thou&s;and pounds a year to &s;upport a carriage, and to purcha&s;e all the other conveniences which &s;he has been u&s;ed to in her father's hou&s;e: I need not tell you, that the ta&s;k I now impo&s;e is a difficult one, and that the execution of it will demand the utmo&s;t delicacy and addre&s;s; Loui&s;a is all &s;oul; yet nobody knows how to give things a better manner than my &s;i&s;ter, and if there is a po&s;&s;ibility of managing the

matter I am &s;en&s;ible &s;he will be able to effect it. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that I mu&s;t on no account appear in the affair. If Mi&s;s Mildmay could be cheated into an opinion, that the allowance is made privately by her father, who is unwill|ing to &s;hew how much he &s;till loves her; or if&mdash;But damn it, I am all the time for|getting that her family would wonder by what method &s;he was enabled to keep an equipage; and, perhaps, from an opinion that it was by &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter means&mdash;you under&s;tand me&mdash;become le&s;s in|clined to forgive her&mdash;this way there|fore will never do&mdash;Yet &s;tay&mdash;I have it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e my &s;i&s;ter was &s;ecretly to make Mrs. Darnel the allowance I have been talking of for Loui&s;a's ea&s;e; I have &s;ome little knowledge of Mrs. Darnel, and I fancy her circum&s;tances are none of the be&s;t&mdash;Under an affectation of great gravity I am &s;ure &s;he conceals an

in&s;uperable pride, and &s;eems to di&s;pi&s;e that glitter from principle, which &s;he is unable to enjoy from the narrowne&s;s of her fortune; lady Haver&s;ham may therefore &s;et up a chariot for Mrs. Darnel; Loui&s;a you know by re&s;iding with her will have it at command; and Mrs. Darnel &s;hall have it rendered worth her while to pre&s;ent her amiable cou&s;in with a &s;ufficient &s;um of money as op|portunities occur, for all her other con|tingencies. Mrs. Darnel I &s;ee has obli|gations to the Mildmay family; but whatever &s;he lo&s;es by her politene&s;s on this occa&s;ion, &s;hall be doubled to her by an annuity, or how &s;he plea&s;es; &s;he may talk of a ticket in the lottery, you know, or make any other common ex|cu&s;e for the alteration of appearances.</P>
<P>And yet Melmoth, I am &s;ome how &s;orry Loui&s;a is to be at Mrs. Darnel's, &s;he is a woman of whom I entertain no

very great opinion. I have been three or four times in her company at acci|dental vi&s;its, and always found her &s;o humble, and &s;o fawning; &s;o religious and &s;o &s;entimental; that I am fearful my poor Loui&s;a will have but a di&s;agreeable companion. An exce&s;s of humility to tho&s;e who are our &s;uperiors in fortune is always a &s;ign of a mean mind; the heart is unworthy of re&s;pect, which never &s;eems inclined to a&s;&s;ert its natural equality; and I would much &s;ooner com|mence a friend&s;hip with tho&s;e who are perpetually contradicting me, than with tho&s;e who have a &s;mile for every thing I &s;ay, and never take the liberty to con|tradict me at all.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el has this mo|ment called to take me on board&mdash;Till I hear from you I &s;hall take up my re&s;i|dence at the great mar&s;hal Turene's in Rotterdam&mdash;I have u&s;ed the hou&s;e once

already, and found the people very care|ful of my letters. Pray write imme|diately, and let your pacquet be a large one; enquire minutely into the colonel's &s;ituation, and tell me what is &s;aid by lady Haver&s;ham, and Loui&s;a. O! Charles, adver&s;ity is your only forcible morali&s;t; the pangs which I now &s;uffer in con&s;equence of my folly give me a higher veneration for virtue than the works of our mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;o|phers; and I find more wi&s;dom is to be obtained from a moment's experience than from a whole eternity of idle &s;pecu|lation&mdash;But when reflection comes too late of what &s;ervice is it to moralize! God ble&s;s you therefore my dear Mel|moth, and believe me to be with an everla&s;ting attachment</P>
