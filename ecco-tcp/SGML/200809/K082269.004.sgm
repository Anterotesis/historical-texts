<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A RENOVATION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA was accompanied by her maid in the chai&s;e, and her own &s;ervant and one of Mrs. Delvile's attended her on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The quietne&s;s of her dejection was &s;oon interrupted by a loud cry among the men of <Q REND="inline">"home! home! home!"</Q> She then looked out of one of the windows, and per|ceived Fidel, running after the carriage, and barking at the &s;ervants, who were all endeavouring to &s;end him back.</P>
<P>Touched by this proof of the animal's gratitude for her attention to him, and con|&s;cious &s;he had her&s;elf occa&s;ioned his ma&s;|ter's leaving him, the &s;cheme of Lady Ho|noria occurred to her, and &s;he almo&s;t wi&s;hed
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to put it in execution, but this was the thought of a moment, and motioning him with her hand to go back, &s;he de&s;ired Mrs. Delvile's man to return with him immedi|ately, and commit him to the care of &s;ome|body in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This little incident, however trifling, was the mo&s;t important of her journey, for &s;he arrived at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Charlton without meeting any other.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of that lady gave her a &s;en&s;a|tion of plea&s;ure to which &s;he had long been a &s;tranger, plea&s;ure pure, unmixed, unaf|fected and unre&s;trained: it revived all her early affection, and with it, &s;omething re|&s;embling at lea&s;t her early tranquility: again &s;he was in the hou&s;e where it had once been undi&s;turbed, again &s;he enjoyed the &s;o|ciety which was once all &s;he had wi&s;hed, and again &s;aw the &s;ame &s;cene, the &s;ame faces, and &s;ame pro&s;pects &s;he had beheld while her heart was all devoted to her friends.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, though old and infirm, pre&s;erved an under&s;tanding, which, when|ever unbia&s;&s;ed by her affections, was &s;ure to direct her unerringly; but the extreme &s;oftne&s;s of her temper frequently mi&s;led her judgment, by making it, at the plea&s;ure either of misfortune or of artifice, always yield to compa&s;&s;ion, and pliant to entreaty. Where her coun&s;el and opinion were de|manded, they were certain to reflect honour
<PB N="5" REF="4">
on her capacity and di&s;cernment; but where her a&s;&s;i&s;tance or her pity were &s;upplicated, her pur&s;e and her tears were immediately be&s;towed, and in her zeal to alleviate di&s;|tre&s;s &s;he forgot if the object were de&s;erving her &s;olicitude, and &s;topt not to con&s;ider propriety or di&s;cretion, if happine&s;s, how|ever momentary, were in her power to grant.</P>
<P>This generous foible was, however, kept &s;omewhat in &s;ubjection by the watchfulne&s;s of two grand-daughters, who, fearing the injury they might them&s;elves receive from it, failed not to point out both its incon|venience and its danger.</P>
<P>The&s;e ladies were daughters of a de|cea&s;ed and only &s;on of Mrs. Charlton; they were &s;ingle, and lived with their grand-mother, who&s;e fortune, which was con&s;iderable, they expected to &s;hare between them, and they waited with eagerne&s;s for the moment of appropriation; narrow|minded and rapacious, they wi&s;hed to mo|nopolize whatever &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and thought them&s;elves aggrieved by her &s;mal|le&s;t donations. Their chief employment was to keep from her all objects of di&s;tre&s;s, and in this though they could not &s;ucceed, they at lea&s;t confined her liberality to &s;uch as re&s;embled them&s;elves; &s;ince neither the &s;pirited could brook, nor the delicate &s;up|port the checks and rebuffs from the grand-daughters,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which followed the gifts of Mrs. Charlton. Cecilia, of all her acquaintance, was the only one who&s;e intimacy they en|couraged, for they knew her fortune made her &s;uperior to any mercenary views, and they received from her them&s;elves more ci|vilities than they paid.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton loved Cecilia with an ex|ce&s;s of fondne&s;s, that not only took place of the love &s;he bore her other friends, but to which even her regard for the Mi&s;s Charl|tons was inferior and feeble. Cecilia when a child had reverenced her as a mother, and, grateful for her tenderne&s;s and care, had afterwards cheri&s;hed her as a friend. The revival of this early connection de|lighted them both, it was balm to the wounded mind of Cecilia, it was renovation to the exi&s;tence of Mrs. Charlton.</P>
<P>Early the next morning &s;he wrote a card to Mr. Monckton and Lady Margaret, ac|quainting them with her return into Suffolk, and de&s;iring to know when &s;he might pay her re&s;pects to her Lady&s;hip. She received from the old lady a verbal an&s;wer, <HI>when &s;he pleased,</HI> but Mr. Monckton came in|&s;tantly him&s;elf to Mrs. Charlton's.</P>
<P>His a&s;toni&s;hment, his rapture at this un|expected incident were almo&s;t boundle&s;s; he thought it a &s;udden turn of fortune in his own favour, and concluded, now &s;he
<PB N="7" REF="6">
had e&s;caped the danger of Delvile Ca&s;tle, the road was &s;hort and certain that led to his own &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Her &s;atisfaction in the meeting was as &s;incere, though not &s;o animated as his own: but this &s;imilarity in their feelings was of &s;hort duration, for when he enquired into what had pa&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle, with the rea&s;ons of her quitting it, the pain &s;he felt in giving even a cur&s;ory and eva&s;ive ac|count, was oppo&s;ed on his part by the warme&s;t delight in hearing it: he could not obtain from her the particulars of what had happened, but the reluctance with which &s;he &s;poke, the air of mortification with which &s;he heard his que&s;tions, and the evi|dent di&s;plea&s;ure which was mingled in her chagrin, when he forced her to mention Delvile, were all proofs the mo&s;t indi&s;put|able and &s;atisfactory, that they had either parted without any explanation, or with one by which Cecilia had been hurt and of|fended.</P>
<P>He now readily concluded that &s;ince the fiery trial he had mo&s;t apprehended was over; and &s;he had quitted in anger the a&s;ylum &s;he had &s;ought in extacy, Delvile him&s;elf did not covet the alliance, which, &s;ince they were &s;eparated, was never likely to take place. He had therefore little diffi|culty in promi&s;ing all &s;ucce&s;s to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
She was once more upon the &s;pot where &s;he had regarded him as the fir&s;t of men, he knew that during her ab&s;ence no one had &s;ettled in the neighbourhood who had any preten&s;ions to di&s;pute with him that pre|eminence, he &s;hould again have acce&s;s to her, at plea&s;ure, and &s;o &s;anguine grew his hopes, that he almo&s;t began to rejoice even in the partiality to Delvile that had hitherto been his terror, from believing it would give her for a time, that &s;ullen di&s;ta&s;te of all other connections, to which tho&s;e who at once are delicate and fervent are commonly led by early di&s;appointment. His whole &s;olicitude therefore now was to pre&s;erve her e&s;teem, to &s;eek her confidence, and to regain whatever by ab&s;ence might be lo&s;t of the a&s;cendant over her mind which her re&s;pect for his knowledge and capacity had for many years given him. Fortune at this time &s;eemed to pro&s;per all his views, and, by a &s;troke the mo&s;t &s;udden and unexpected, to render more rational his hopes and his plans than he had him&s;elf been able to effect by the ut|mo&s;t craft of worldly wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The day following Cecilia, in Mrs. Charl|ton's chai&s;e, waited upon Lady Margaret. She was received by Mi&s;s Bennet, her com|panion, with the mo&s;t fawning courte&s;y; but when conducted to the lady of the hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;o evidently unwel|come,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
that &s;he even regretted the civility which had prompted her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She found with her nobody but Mr. Morrice, who was the only young man that could per&s;uade him&s;elf to endure her company in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, but who, in common with mo&s;t young men who are a&s;&s;iduous in their attendance upon old ladies, doubted not but he en&s;ured him&s;elf a hand&s;ome legacy for his trouble.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the fir&s;t &s;peech which her lady|&s;hip made, was <Q REND="inline">"So you are not married yet, I find; if Mr. Monckton had been a real friend, he would have taken care to have &s;een for &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was by no means,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"either in &s;o much ha&s;te or di&s;tre&s;s as to require from Mr. Monckton any &s;uch exertion of his friend&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"what a ter|rible night we had of it at Vauxhall! poor Harrel! I was really exce&s;&s;ively &s;orry for him. I had not courage to &s;ee you or Mrs. Harrel after it. But as &s;oon as I heard you were in St. James's-Square, I tried to wait <HI>upon you; for really going to Mr. Harrel</HI>'s again would have been quite too di&s;mal. I would rather have run a mile by the &s;ide of a race-hor&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no occa&s;ion for any apology,"</Q>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for I was very little di&s;po&s;ed either to &s;ee or think of vi&s;itors."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I thought, ma'am;"</Q> an&s;wered he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and really that made me the le&s;s alert in finding you out. However, ma'am, next winter I &s;hall be exce&s;&s;ively happy to make up for the deficiency; be|&s;ides, I &s;hall be much obliged to you to in|troduce me to Mr. Delvile, for I have a great de&s;ire to be acquainted with him."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, thought Cecilia would be but too proud to hear it! However, &s;he merely an&s;wered that &s;he had no pre&s;ent pro&s;pect of &s;pending any time at Mr. Delvile's next winter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, ma'am, true,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"now I recollect, you become your own mi&s;tre&s;s between this and then; and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e you will naturally chu&s;e a hou&s;e of your own, which will be much more eligible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't think that,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Mar|garet, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;aw any thing eligible come of young women's having hou&s;es of their own; &s;he will do a much better thing to marry, and have &s;ome proper per&s;on to take care of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing more right, ma'am!"</Q> re|turned he; <Q REND="inline">"a young lady in a hou&s;e by her&s;elf mu&s;t be &s;ubject to a thou&s;and dangers. What &s;ort of place, ma'am, has Mr. Delvile got in the country? I hear he
<PB N="11" REF="10">
has a good deal of ground there, and a large hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is an old ca&s;tle, Sir, and &s;ituated in a park."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That mu&s;t be terribly forlorn: I dare &s;ay, ma'am, you were very happy to return into Suffolk."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I did not find it forlorn; I was very well &s;atisfied with it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, indeed, upon &s;econd thoughts, I don't much wonder; an old ca&s;tle in a large park mu&s;t make a very romantic ap|pearance; &s;omething noble in it, I dare &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye,"</Q> cried Lady Margaret, <Q REND="inline">"they &s;aid you were to become mi&s;tre&s;s of it, and marry Mr. Delvile's &s;on: and I cannot, for my own part, &s;ee any objection to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am told of &s;o many &s;trange reports,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and all, to my&s;elf &s;o unac|countable, that I begin now to hear of them without much wonder."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's a charming young man, I be|lieve,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"I had the plea&s;ure once or twice of meeting him at poor Har|rel's, and he &s;eemed mighty agreeable. Is not he &s;o, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,&mdash;I believe &s;o."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, I don't mean to &s;peak of him as any thing very extraordinary,"</Q> cried Mor|rice, imagining her he&s;itation proceeded
<PB N="12" REF="11">
from di&s;like, <Q REND="inline">"I merely meant as the world goes,&mdash;in a common &s;ort of way."</Q></P>
<P>Here they were joined by Mr. Monckton and &s;ome gentlemen who were on a vi&s;it at his hou&s;e; for his anxiety was not of a &s;ort to lead him to &s;olitude, nor his di&s;po&s;ition to make him deny him&s;elf any kind of en|joyment which he had power to attain. A general conver&s;ation en&s;ued, which la&s;ted till Cecilia ended her vi&s;it; Mr. Monckton then took her hand to lead her to the chai&s;e, but told her, in their way out, of &s;ome alterations in his grounds, which he de&s;ired to &s;hew her: his view of detaining her was to gather what &s;he thought of her reception, and whether &s;he had yet any &s;u&s;|picions of the jealou&s;y of Lady Margaret; well knowing, from the delicacy of her character, that if once &s;he became ac|quainted with it, &s;he would &s;crupulou&s;ly avoid all intercour&s;e with him, from the fear of encrea&s;ing her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He began, therefore, with talking of the plea&s;ure which Lady Margaret took in the plantations, and of his hope that Cecilia would often favour her by vi&s;iting them, without waiting to have her vi&s;its returned, as &s;he was entitled by her infirmities to par|ticular indulgencies. He was continuing in this &s;train, receiving from Cecilia hardly any an&s;wer, when &s;uddenly from behind a
<PB N="13" REF="12">
thick laurel bu&s;h, jumpt up Mr. Morrice; who had run out of the hou&s;e by a &s;horter cut, and planted him&s;elf there to &s;urpri&s;e them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So ho!"</Q> cried he with a loud laugh, <Q REND="inline">"I have caught you!" This will be a fine anecdote for Lady Margaret; I vow I'll tell her."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, never off his guard, readily an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Aye, prithee do, Mor|rice; but don't omit to relate al&s;o what we &s;aid of your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of me?"</Q> cried he, with &s;ome eager|ne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"why you never mentioned me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that won't pa&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you; we &s;hall tell another tale at table by and by; and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of li&s;teners upon you in its full force."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I'll be hanged if I know what you mean!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you won't pretend you did not hear Mi&s;s Beverley &s;ay you were the true&s;t Ouran Outang, or man-monkey, &s;he ever knew?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, that I did not!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No?&mdash;Nor how much &s;he admired your dexterity in e&s;caping being hor&s;e|whipt three times a day for your incurable impudence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not a word on't! Hor&s;e-whipt!&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Mi&s;s Beverley, pray did you &s;ay any &s;uch thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> cried Monckton, again, <Q REND="inline">"and not only hor&s;e-<HI>whipt,</HI> but hor&s;e-<HI>ponded,</HI> for &s;he thought when one had heated, the other might cool you; and then you might be fitted again for your native woods, for &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon it you was brought from Africa, and are not yet half tamed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O lord!"</Q> cried Morrice, amazed, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected Mi&s;s Beverley would have talked &s;o!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you &s;u&s;pect &s;he did now?"</Q> cried Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pho, pho,"</Q> cried Monckton, coolly, <Q REND="inline">"why he heard it him&s;elf the whole time! and &s;o &s;hall all our party by and bye, if I can but remember to mention it."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then returned to the chai&s;e, leav|ing Mr. Monckton to &s;ettle the matter with his credulous gue&s;t as he plea&s;ed; for &s;uppo&s;ing he was merely gratifying a love of &s;port, or taking this method of checking the general forwardne&s;s of the young man, &s;he forebore any interference that might mar his intention.</P>
<P>But Mr. Monckton loved not to be ral|lied concerning Cecilia, though he was in|different to all that could be &s;aid to him of any other woman; he meant, therefore, to intimidate Morrice from renewing the &s;ub|ject;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and he &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; poor Morrice, who&s;e watching and who&s;e &s;peech were the mere blunders of chance, made without the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of Mr. Monckton's de&s;igns, now apprehended &s;ome &s;cheme to render him&s;elf ridiculous, and though he did not believe Cecilia had made u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, he fancied Mr. Monckton meant to turn the laugh again&s;t him, and determined, therefore, to &s;ay nothing that might remind him of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton had at this time admitted him to his hou&s;e merely from an expectation of finding more amu&s;ement in his blunder|ing and giddine&s;s, than he was capable, during his anxiety concerning Cecilia, of receiving from conver&s;ation of an higher &s;ort.</P>
<P>The character of Morrice was, indeed, particularly adapted for the entertainment of a large hou&s;e in the country; eager for &s;port, and always ready for enterprize; wil|ling to oblige, yet tormented with no deli|cacy about offending; the fir&s;t to promote mi&s;chief for any other, and the la&s;t to be offended when expo&s;ed to it him&s;elf; gay, thoughtle&s;s, and volatile,&mdash;a happy com|po&s;ition of levity and good-humour.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, in quitting the hou&s;e, determined not to vi&s;it it again very &s;peedi|ly;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
for &s;he was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted with Lady Margaret, though &s;he &s;u&s;pected no particular motives of enmity, again&s;t which &s;he was guarded alike by her own un&s;u&s;pi|cious innocence, and by an high e&s;teem of Mr. Monckton, which &s;he firmly believed he returned with equal hone&s;ty of unde|&s;igning friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Her next excur&s;ion was to vi&s;it Mrs. Harrel; &s;he found that unhappy lady a prey to all the mi&s;ery of unoccupied &s;olitude: torn from whatever had, to her, made exi&s;t|ence &s;eem valuable, her mind was as li&s;tle&s;s as her per&s;on was inactive, and &s;he was at a lo&s;s how to employ even a moment of the day: &s;he had now neither a party to form, nor an entertainment to plan, company to arrange, nor dre&s;s to con&s;ider; and the&s;e, with vi&s;its and public places, had filled all her time &s;ince her marriage, which, as it had hap|pened very early in her life, had merely taken place of girli&s;h amu&s;ements, ma&s;ters and governe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of in&s;ipidity, however, though naturally the effect of a mind devoid of all genuine re&s;ources, was digni|fied by her&s;elf with the appellation of &s;or|row: nor was this merely a &s;creen to the world; unu&s;ed to inve&s;tigate her feelings or examine her heart, the general compa&s;&s;ion &s;he met for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, per|&s;uaded
<PB N="17" REF="16">
her that indeed &s;he lamented his de&s;|tiny; though had no change in her life been cau&s;ed by his &s;uicide, &s;he would &s;carcely, when the fir&s;t &s;hock was over, have thought of it again.</P>
<P>She received Cecilia with great plea&s;ure; and with &s;till greater, heard the renewal of her promi&s;es to fit up a room for her in her hou&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he came of age; a period which now was hardly a month di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Far greater, however, as well as infinitely purer, was the joy which her pre&s;ence be|&s;towed upon Mr. Arnott; &s;he &s;aw it her|&s;elf with a &s;en&s;ation of regret, not only at the con&s;tant pa&s;&s;ion which occa&s;ioned it, but even at her own inability to participate in or reward it: for with him an alliance would meet with no oppo&s;ition; his character was amiable, his &s;ituation in life unexception|able: he loved her with the tendere&s;t affec|tion, and no pride, &s;he well knew, would interfere to overpower it; yet, in return, to grant him her love, &s;he felt as utterly im|po&s;&s;ible as to refu&s;e him her e&s;teem: and the &s;uperior attractions of Delvile, of which neither di&s;plea&s;ure nor mortification could rob him, &s;hut up her heart, for the pre&s;ent, more firmly than ever, as Mr. Monckton had well imagined, to all other a&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he by no means weakly gave way to repining or regret: her &s;u&s;pence was at an
<PB N="18" REF="17">
end, her hopes and her fears were &s;ub&s;ided into certainty; Delvile, in quitting her, had acquainted her that he left her for ever, and even, though not, indeed, with much &s;tea|dine&s;s, had prayed for her happine&s;s in union with &s;ome other; &s;he held it there|fore as e&s;&s;ential to her character as to her peace, to manife&s;t equal fortitude in &s;ub|duing her partiality; &s;he forebore to hint to Mrs. Charlton what had pa&s;&s;ed, that the &s;ubject might never be &s;tarted; allowed her&s;elf no time for dangerous recollection; &s;trolled in her old walks, and renewed her old acquaintance, and by a vigorous exer|tion of active wi&s;dom, doubted not com|pleating, before long, the &s;ubjection of her unfortunate tenderne&s;s. Nor was her ta&s;k &s;o difficult as &s;he had feared; re&s;olution, in &s;uch ca&s;es, may act the office of time, and anticipate by rea&s;on and &s;elf-denial, what that, much le&s;s nobly, effects through for|getfulne&s;s and incon&s;tancy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A VISIT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE week only, however, had yet tried the per&s;everance of Cecilia, when, while &s;he was working with Mrs. Charlton in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, her maid ha&s;tily en|tered it, and with a &s;mile that &s;eemed an|nouncing welcome news, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, ma'am, here's Fidel!"</Q> and, at the &s;ame moment, &s;he was followed by the dog, who jumpt upon Cecilia in a tran&s;port of delight.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven,"</Q> cried &s;he, all amaze|ment, <Q REND="inline">"who has brought him? whence does he come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A country man brought him, ma'am; but he only put him in, and would not &s;tay a minute."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But whom did he enquire for?&mdash;who &s;aw him?&mdash;what did he &s;ay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He &s;aw Ralph, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P>Ralph, then, was in&s;tantly called: and the&s;e que&s;tions being repeated, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ma'am, it was a man I never &s;aw be|fore; but he only bid me take care to de|liver
<PB N="20" REF="19">
the dog into your own hands, and &s;aid you would have a letter about him &s;oon, and then went away: I wanted him to &s;tay till I came up &s;tairs, but he was off at once."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, quite confounded by this ac|count, could make neither comment nor an&s;wer; but, as &s;oon as the &s;ervants had left the room, Mrs. Charlton entreated to know to whom the dog had belonged, con|vinced by her extreme agitation, that &s;omething intere&s;ting and uncommon mu&s;t relate to him.</P>
<P>This was no time for di&s;gui&s;e; a&s;toni&s;h|ment and confu&s;ion bereft Cecilia of all power to attempt it; and, after a very few eva&s;ions, &s;he briefly communicated her &s;itu|ation with re&s;pect to Delvile, his leaving her, his motives, and his mother's evident concurrence: for the&s;e were all &s;o con|nected with her knowledge of Fidel, that &s;he led to them unavoidably in telling what &s;he knew of him.</P>
<P>Very little penetration was requi&s;ite, to gather from her manner all that was unit|ed in her narrative of her own feelings and di&s;appointment in the cour&s;e of this affair: and Mrs. Charlton, who had hi|therto believed the whole world at her di&s;|po&s;al, and that &s;he continued &s;ingle from no rea&s;on but her own difficulty of choice,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
was utterly amazed to find that any man exi&s;ted who could with&s;tand the united al|lurements of &s;o much beauty, &s;weetne&s;s, and fortune. She felt her&s;elf &s;ometimes inclined to hate, and at other times to pity him; yet concluded that her own extreme coldne&s;s was the real cau&s;e of his flight, and warmly blamed a re&s;erve which had thus ruined her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Cecilia was in the extreme&s;t perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s to conjecture the meaning of &s;o unaccountable a pre&s;ent, and &s;o &s;trange a me&s;&s;age. Delvile, &s;he knew, had de&s;ired the dog might follow him to Bri&s;tol; his mother, always plea&s;ed to oblige him, would now le&s;s than ever neglect any op|portunity; &s;he could not, therefore, doubt that &s;he had &s;ent or taken him thither, and thence, according to all appearances, he mu&s;t now come. But was it likely Delvile would take &s;uch a liberty? Was it probable, when &s;o lately he had almo&s;t exhorted her to forget him, he would even wi&s;h to pre&s;ent her with &s;uch a remem|brance of him&s;elf? And what was the let|ter &s;he was bid to expect? Whence and from whom was it to come?</P>
<P>All was inexplicable! the only thing &s;he could &s;urmi&s;e, with any &s;emblance of pro|bability, was that the whole was &s;ome fro|lic of Lady Honoria Pemberton, who had
<PB N="22" REF="21">
per&s;uaded Delvile to &s;end her the dog, and perhaps a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had her&s;elf re|que&s;ted to have him.</P>
<P>Provoked by this &s;ugge&s;tion, her fir&s;t thought was in&s;tantly having him con|veyed to the ca&s;tle; but uncertain what the whole affair meant, and hoping &s;ome explanation in the letter &s;he was promi&s;ed, &s;he determined to wait till it came, or at lea&s;t till &s;he heard from Mrs. Delvile, be|fore &s;he took any mea&s;ures her&s;elf in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Mutual accounts of their &s;afe arrivals at Bri&s;tol and in Suffolk, had al|ready pa&s;&s;ed between them, and &s;he ex|pected very &s;oon to have further intelli|gence: though &s;he was now, by the whole behaviour of Mrs. Delvile, convinced &s;he wi&s;hed not again to have her an inmate of her hou&s;e, and that the re&s;t of her mi|nority might pa&s;s, without oppo&s;ition, in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Charlton.</P>
<P>Day after day, however, pa&s;&s;ed, and yet &s;he heard nothing more; a week, a fort|night elap&s;ed, and &s;till no letter came. She now concluded the promi&s;e was a de|ception, and repented that &s;he had waited a moment with any &s;uch expectation. Her peace, during this time, was greatly di&s;|turbed; this pre&s;ent made her fear &s;he was thought meanly of by Mr. Delvile; the &s;ilence of his mother gave her apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="23" REF="22">
for his health, and her own irre&s;olution how to act, kept her in perpetual inquietude. She tried in vain to behave as if this in|cident had not happened; her mind was unea&s;y, and the &s;ame actions produced not the &s;ame effects; when &s;he now worked or read, the &s;ight of Fidel by her &s;ide di|&s;tracted her attention; when &s;he walked, it was the &s;ame, for Fidel always followed her; and though, in vi&s;iting her old ac|quaintance, &s;he forbore to let him accom|pany her, &s;he was &s;ecretly planning the whole time the contents of &s;ome letter, which &s;he expected to meet with, on re|turning to Mrs. Charlton's.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid their addre&s;&s;es to Cecilia, again waited upon her at Mrs. Charlton's, and renewed their propo&s;als. They had now, however, &s;till le&s;s chance of &s;ucce&s;s, and their di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion was brief and deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e came Mr. Biddulph; and to him Cecilia was involuntarily mo&s;t ci|vil, becau&s;e &s;he knew him to be the friend of Delvile. Yet his conver&s;ation encrea&s;ed the unea&s;ine&s;s of her &s;u&s;pence; for after &s;peaking of the family in general which &s;he had left, he enquired more particu|larly concerning Delvile, and then added, <Q REND="inline">"I am, indeed, greatly grieved to find,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
by all the accounts I receive of him, that he is now in a very bad &s;tate of health."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech gave her fre&s;h &s;ubject for apprehen&s;ion; and in proportion as the &s;ilence of Mrs. Delvile grew more alarm|ing, her regard for her favourite Fidel be|came more partial. The affectionate ani|mal &s;eemed to mourn the lo&s;s of his ma&s;|ter, and while &s;ometimes &s;he indulged her|&s;elf in fancifully telling him her fears, &s;he imagined &s;he read in his countenance the faithfulle&s;t &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>One week of her minority was now all that remained, and &s;he was &s;oon wholly occupied in preparations for coming of age. She purpo&s;ed taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large hou&s;e that had belonged to her uncle, which was &s;ituated only three miles from that of Mrs. Charlton; and &s;he employed her&s;elf in giving orders for fitting it up, and in hearing complaints, and promi&s;ing indulgencies, to various of her tenants.</P>
<P>At this time, while &s;he was at breakfa&s;t one morning, a letter arrived from Mrs. Delvile. She apologi&s;ed for not writing &s;ooner, but added that various family oc|currences, which had robbed her of all lei|&s;ure, might ea&s;ily be imagined, when &s;he acquainted her that Mortimer had deter|mined upon again going abroad. ..... They were all, &s;he &s;aid, returned to Delvile-Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="25" REF="24">
but mentioned nothing either of the health of her &s;on, or of her own re|gret, and filled up the re&s;t of her letter with general news, and expre&s;&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s: though, in a po&s;t&s;cript, was inferted, <Q REND="inline">"We have lo&s;t our poor Fidel."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;till meditating upon this letter, by which her perplexity how to act was rather encrea&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, when, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, Lady Honoria Pem|berton was announced. She ha&s;tily begged one of the Mi&s;s Charltons to convey Fidel out of &s;ight, from a dread of her raillery, &s;hould &s;he, at la&s;t, be unconcerned in the tran&s;action, and then went to receive her.</P>
<P>Lady Honoria, who was with her go|verne&s;s, gave a brief hi&s;tory of her quit|ting Delvile-Ca&s;tle, and &s;aid &s;he was now going with her father to vi&s;it a noble fa|mily in Nor&s;olk: but &s;he had obtained his permi&s;&s;ion to leave him at the inn where they had &s;lept, in order to make a &s;hort excur&s;ion to Bury, for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Beverley.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And therefore,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I "can &s;tay but half an hour; &s;o you mu&s;t give me &s;ome account of your&s;elf as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What account does your lady&s;hip re|quire?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, who you live with here, and
<PB N="26" REF="25">
who are your companions, and what you do with your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I live with Mrs. Charlton; and for companions, I have at lea&s;t a &s;core; here are her two grand-daughters, and Mrs. and Mi&s;s &mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pho, pho,"</Q> interrupted Lady Honoria, <Q REND="inline">"but I don't mean &s;uch hum-drum com|panions as tho&s;e; you'll tell me next, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the par&s;on, and his wife and three daughters, with all their cou&s;ins and aunts: I hate tho&s;e &s;ort of people. What I de&s;ire to hear of is, who are your parti|cular favourites; and whether you take long walks here, as you u&s;ed to do at the Ca&s;tle, and who you have to accompany you?"</Q> And then, looking at her very archly, &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"A pretty little dog, now, I &s;hould think, would be va&s;tly agreeable in &s;uch a place as this.&mdash;Ah, Mi&s;s Beverley! you have not left off that trick of colouring, I &s;ee!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I colour now,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, fully convinced of the ju&s;tnefs of her &s;u&s;picions, <Q REND="inline">"I think it mu&s;t be for your lady&s;hip, not my&s;elf; for, if I am not much mi&s;taken, either in per&s;on, or by proxy, a blu&s;h from Lady Honoria Pemberton would not, ju&s;t now, be wholly out of &s;ea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"how like that is to a &s;peech of Mrs. Delvile's! She has
<PB N="27" REF="26">
taught you exactly her manner of talking. But do you know I am informed you have got Fidel with you here? O fie, Mi&s;s Beverley! What will papa and mamma &s;ay, when they find you have taken away poor little ma&s;ter's play-thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And O fie, Lady Honoria! what &s;hall <HI>I</HI> &s;ay, when I find you guilty of this mi&s;|chievous frolic! I mu&s;t beg, however, &s;ince you have gone thus far, that you will proceed a little farther, and &s;end back the dog to the per&s;on from whom you received him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not I! manage him all your own way: if you chu&s;e to accept dogs from gentlemen, you know, it is your affair, and not mine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you really will not return him your|&s;elf, you mu&s;t at lea&s;t pardon me &s;hould you hear that <HI>I</HI> do in your lady&s;hip's name."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Honoria for &s;ome time only laughed and rallied, without coming to any expla|nation; but when &s;he had exhau&s;ted all the &s;port &s;he could make, &s;he frankly owned that &s;he had her&s;elf ordered the dog to be privately &s;tolen, and then &s;ent a man with him to Mrs. Charlton's.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you know,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"I really owed you a &s;pite for being &s;o ill|natured as to run away after &s;ending me
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to call Mortimer to comfort and take leave of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you dream, Lady Honoria? when did I &s;end you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you know you looked as if you wi&s;hed it, and that was the &s;ame thing. But really it made me appear exce&s;&s;ively &s;illy, when I had forced him to come back with me, and told him you were waiting for him,&mdash;to &s;ee nothing of you at all, and not be able to find or trace you. He took it all for my own invention."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was it <HI>not</HI> your own invention?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why that's nothing to the purpo&s;e; I wanted him to believe you &s;ent me, for I knew el&s;e he would not come."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip was a great deal too good!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why now &s;uppo&s;e I had brought you together, what po&s;&s;ible harm could have happened from it? It would merely have given each of you &s;ome notion of a fever and ague; for fir&s;t you would both have been hot, and then you would both have been cold, and then you would both have turned red, and then you would both have turned white, and then you would both have pretended to &s;imper at the trick; and then there would have been an end of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is a very ea&s;y way of &s;ettling it all,"</Q> cried Cecilia laughing; <Q REND="inline">"however,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
you mu&s;t be content to abide by your own theft, for you cannot in con&s;cience expect I &s;hould take it upon my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are terribly ungrateful, I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid her lady&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"for all the trouble and contrivance and expence I have been at merely to oblige you, while the whole time, poor Mortimer, I dare &s;ay, has had his &s;weet Pet adverti&s;ed in all the news|papers, and cried in every market-town in the kingdom. By the way, if you do &s;end him back, I would advi&s;e you to let your man demand the reward that has been of|fered for him, which may &s;erve in part of payment for his travelling expences."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia could only &s;hake her head, and recollect Mrs. Delvile's expre&s;&s;ion, that her levity was incorrigible.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O if you had &s;een,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;heepi&s;h Mortimer looked when I told him you were dying to &s;ee him before he &s;et off! he coloured &s;o!&mdash;ju&s;t as you do now!&mdash;but I think you're va&s;tly alike."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, not very angry at this &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"there is but little chance your lady&s;hip &s;hould like either of us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, I do! I like odd people of all things."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Odd people? and in what are we &s;o very odd?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
<Q REND="inline">"O, in a thou&s;and things. You're &s;o good, you know, and &s;o grave, and &s;o &s;queami&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Squeami&s;h? how?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, you know, you never laugh at the old folks, and never fly at your &s;er|vants, nor &s;moke people before their faces, and are &s;o civil to all the old <HI>fograms,</HI> you would make one imagine you liked nobody &s;o well. By the way, I could do no good with my little Lord Derford; he pretended to find out I was only laughing at him, and &s;o he minded nothing I told him. I dare &s;ay, however, his father made the detec|tion, for I am &s;ure he had not wit enough to di&s;cover it him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>"Cecilia then, very &s;eriou&s;ly began to entreat that &s;he would return the dog her|&s;elf, and confe&s;s her frolic, remon&s;trating in &s;trong terms upon the mi&s;chievous ten|dency and con&s;equences of &s;uch incon|&s;iderate flights.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried &s;he, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"this is all va&s;tly true; but I have no time to hear any more of it ju&s;t now; be&s;ides, it's only fore&s;talling my next lecture from Mrs. Delvile, for you talk &s;o much alike, that it is really very perplexing to me to re|member which is which."</Q></P>
<P>She then hurried away, prote&s;ting &s;he had already out&s;tayed her father's pa|tience,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
and declaring the delay of another minute would occa&s;ion half a dozen ex|pre&s;&s;es to know whether &s;he was gone to|wards Scotland or Flanders.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it, however, was both plea&s;ant and con&s;olatory to Cecilia; who was now relieved from her &s;u&s;pence, and revived in her &s;pirits by the intelligence that Delvile had no &s;hare in &s;ending her a pre&s;ent, which, from him, would have been humi|liating and impertinent. She regretted, in|deed, that &s;he had not in&s;tantly returned it to the ca&s;tle, which &s;he was now con|vinced was the mea&s;ure &s;he ought to have pur&s;ued; but to make all po&s;&s;ible repar|ation, &s;he determined that her own &s;er|vant &s;hould &s;et out with him the next morning to Bri&s;tol, and take a letter to Mrs. Delvile to explain what had hap|pened, &s;ince to conceal it from any deli|cacy to Lady Honoria, would be to expo&s;e her&s;elf to &s;u&s;picions the mo&s;t mortifying, for which that gay and carele&s;s young lady would never thank her.</P>
<P>She gave orders, therefore, to her &s;er|vant to get ready for the journey.</P>
<P>When &s;he communicated the&s;e little tran&s;actions to Mrs. Charlton, that kind|hearted old lady, who knew her fondne&s;s for Fidel, advi&s;ed her not yet to part with him, but merely to acquaint Mrs. Delvile
<PB N="32" REF="31">
where he was, and what Lady Honoria had done, and, by leaving to her&s;elf the care of &s;ettling his re&s;toration, to give her, at lea&s;t, an opportunity of offering him to her acceptance.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however, would li&s;ten to no &s;uch propo&s;al; &s;he &s;aw the firmne&s;s of Delvile in his re&s;olution to avoid her, and knew that policy, as well as propriety, made it nece&s;|&s;ary &s;he &s;hould part with what &s;he could only retain to remind her of one whom &s;he now mo&s;t wi&s;hed to forget.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN INCIDENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirits of Cecilia, however, inter|nally failed her: &s;he con&s;idered her &s;e|paration from Delvile to be now, in all pro|bability, for life, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw that no &s;trug|gle either of intere&s;t, inclination, or health, could bend him from his purpo&s;e; his mo|ther, too, &s;eemed to regard his name and his exi&s;tence as equally valuable, and the &s;cruples of his father &s;he was certain would be &s;till more in&s;urmountable. Her own pride, excited by theirs, made her, indeed, with more anger than &s;orrow, &s;ee this ge|neral con&s;ent to abandon her; but pride and anger both failed when &s;he con&s;idered the &s;ituation of his health; &s;orrow, there, took the lead, and admitted no partner: it repre&s;ented him to her not only as lo&s;t to her&s;elf, but to the world; and &s;o &s;ad grew her reflections, and &s;o heavy her heart, that, to avoid from Mrs. Charlton ob&s;ervations which pained her, &s;he &s;tole into a &s;um|mer-hou&s;e in the garden the moment &s;he had done tea, declining any companion but her affectionate Fidel.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
Her tenderne&s;s and her &s;orrow found here a romantic con&s;olation, in complaining to him of the ab&s;ence of his ma&s;ter, his volun|tary exile, and her fears for his health: cal|ling upon him to participate in her &s;orrow, and lamenting that even this little relief would &s;oon be denied her; and that in lo&s;ing Fidel no ve&s;tige of Mortimer, but in her own brea&s;t, would remain; <Q REND="inline">"Go, then, dear Fidel,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"carry back to your ma&s;ter all that nouri&s;hes his remembrance! Bid him not love you the le&s;s for having &s;ome time belonged to Cecilia; but never may his proud heart be fed with the vain glory, of knowing how fondly for his &s;ake &s;he has cheri&s;hed you! Go, dear Fidel, guard him by night, and follow him by day; &s;erve him with zeal, and love him with fidelity;&mdash;oh that his health were in|vincible as his pride!&mdash;there, alone, is he vulnerable&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here Fidel, with a loud barking, &s;ud|denly &s;prang away from her, and, as &s;he turned her eyes towards the door to &s;ee what had thus &s;tartled him, &s;he beheld &s;tanding there, as if immoveable, young Delvile him&s;elf!</P>
<P>Her a&s;toni&s;hment at this &s;ight almo&s;t bereft her of her under&s;tanding; it ap|peared to her &s;uper-natural, and &s;he rather believed it was his gho&s;t than him&s;elf.
<PB N="35" REF="34">
Fixed in mute wonder, &s;he &s;tood &s;till though terrified, her eyes almo&s;t bur&s;ting from their &s;ockets to be &s;atisfied if what they &s;aw was real.</P>
<P>Delvile, too, was &s;ome time &s;peechle&s;s; he looked not at her, indeed, with any doubt of her exi&s;tence, but as if what he had heard was to him as amazing as to her what &s;he &s;aw. At length, however, tor|mented by the dog, who jumpt up to him, licked his hands, and by his rapturous joy forced him&s;elf into notice, he was moved to return his care&s;&s;es, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, <HI>dear Fidel!</HI> you have a claim indeed to my at|tention, and with the fonde&s;t gratitude will I cheri&s;h you ever!"</Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ound of his voice, Cecilia again began to breathe; and Delvile having quieted the dog, now entered the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, &s;aying, as he advanced, <Q REND="inline">"Is this po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;am I not in a dream?&mdash;Good God! is it indeed po&s;&s;ible!"</Q></P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of doubt and a&s;toni&s;h|ment which had &s;eized every faculty of Ce|cilia, now changed into certainty that Del|vile indeed was pre&s;ent, all her recollection returned as &s;he li&s;tened to this que&s;tion, and the wild rambling of fancy with which &s;he had incautiou&s;ly indulged her &s;orrow, ru&s;h|ing &s;uddenly upon her mind, &s;he felt her|&s;elf wholly overpowered by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="35">
and &s;hame, and &s;unk, almo&s;t fainting, upon a window-&s;eat.</P>
<P>Delvile in&s;tantly flew to her, penetrated with gratitude, and filled with wonder and delight, which, however internally com|bated by &s;en&s;ations le&s;s plea&s;ant, were too potent for controul, and he poured forth at her feet the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate acknowledg|ments.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed, affected, and trembling with a thou&s;and emotions, endeavoured to break from him and ri&s;e; but, eagerly de|taining her, <Q REND="inline">"No, lovelie&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"not thus mu&s;t we now part! this moment only have I di&s;covered what a trea|&s;ure I was leaving; and, but for Fidel, I had quitted it in ignorance for ever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried Cecilia, in the extreme&s;t agitation, <Q REND="inline">"indeed you may believe me Fi|del is here quite by accident.&mdash;Lady Ho|noria took him away,&mdash;I knew nothing of the matter,&mdash;&s;he &s;tole him, &s;he &s;ent him, &s;he did every thing her&s;elf."</Q></P>

Then again endeavouring to break from him, <Q REND="inline">"Leave me, Mr. Delvile,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"leave me, or let me pa&s;s!&mdash;never can I &s;ee you more!&mdash;never bear you again in my &s;ight!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, <HI>dear Fidel!</HI>"</Q> cried he, &s;till de|taining her, <Q REND="inline">"come and plead for your ma&s;ter! come and a&s;k in his name who <HI>now</HI> has a proud heart, who&s;e pride <HI>now</HI> is in|vincible!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh go!"</Q> cried Cecilia, looking away from him while &s;he &s;poke, <Q REND="inline">"repeat not tho&s;e hateful words, if you wi&s;h me not to dete&s;t my&s;elf eternally!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ever-lovely Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried he, more &s;eriou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"why this re&s;entment? why all this cau&s;ele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s?

<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Mr. Delvile!"</Q> cried &s;he, impa|tiently, though half &s;oftened, <Q REND="inline">"was this honourable or right? to &s;teal upon me thus privately&mdash;to li&s;ten to me thus &s;ecretly&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You blame me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"too &s;oon; your own friend, Mrs. Charlton, permitted

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why will you talk thus, my beloved Mi&s;s Beverley? what have you done,&mdash;what, let me a&s;k, have <HI>I</HI> done, that &s;uch infinite di&s;grace and depre&s;&s;ion &s;hould fol|low this little &s;en&s;ibility to a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o fer|vent?

<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried the mortified Cecilia, who from the moment &s;he found her&s;elf betrayed, believed her&s;elf to be lo&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"far other is the effect it will have! and the &s;ame mad folly by which I am ruined in my own e&s;teem, will ruin me in yours!&mdash;I cannot endure to think of it!&mdash;why will you per&s;i&s;t in detaining me?&mdash;You have filled me with angui&s;h and mortification,&mdash;you have taught me the bittere&s;t of le&s;&s;ons, that of hating and contemning my&s;elf!"</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"what &s;trange apprehen&s;ions thus terrify you? are you with me le&s;s &s;afe than with your&s;elf? is it my honour you doubt? is it my integrity you fear?

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah no!"</Q> cried Cecilia, with a &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"that, at lea&s;t, is impo&s;&s;ible, for lower than ever is &s;he &s;unk from de&s;erving it!"</Q></P>

<P>Cecilia was &s;omewhat appea&s;ed by this &s;peech; and, after a little he&s;itation, &s;he &s;aid, with a half &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I thank you for this good-nature in &s;eeking to reconcile me with my&s;elf?&mdash;or &s;hall I quarrel with
<PB N="40" REF="39">
you for flattery, in giving me prai&s;e you can &s;o little think I merit?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"were I to prai&s;e as I think of you! were my language permit|ted to accord with my opinion of your worth, you would not then &s;imply call me a flatterer, you would tell me I was an idolator, and fear at lea&s;t for my principles, if not for my under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall have but little right, however,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, again ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"to arraign your under&s;tanding while I act as if bereft of my own. Now, at lea&s;t, let me pa&s;s; indeed you will greatly di&s;plea&s;e me by any further oppo&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you &s;uffer me, then, to &s;ee you early to-morrow morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; nor the next morning, nor the morning after that! This meeting has been wrong, another would be wor&s;e; in this I have accu&s;ation enough for folly;&mdash;in another the charge would be far more heavy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Does Mi&s;s Beverley, then,"</Q> cried he gravely, <Q REND="inline">"think me capable of de&s;iring to &s;ee her for mere &s;elfi&s;h gratification? of in|tending to trifle either with her time or her feelings? no; the conference I de&s;ire will be important and deci&s;ive. This night I &s;nall devote &s;olely to deliberation; to|morrow &s;hall be given to action. Without
<PB N="41" REF="40">
&s;ome thinking I dare venture at no plan;&mdash;I pre&s;ume not to communicate to you the various intere&s;ts that divide me, but the re&s;ult of them all I can take no denial to your hearing."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who felt when thus &s;tated the ju&s;tice of his reque&s;t, now oppo&s;ed it no longer, but in&s;i&s;ted upon his in&s;tantly de|parting.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t go!&mdash;the longer I &s;tay, the more I am fa&s;cinated, and the weaker are tho&s;e rea&s;oning powers of which I now want the &s;tronge&s;t exer|tion."</Q> He then repeated his profe&s;&s;ions of eternal regard, be&s;ought her not to regret the happine&s;s &s;he had given him, and after di&s;obeying her injunctions of going till &s;he was &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;plea&s;ed, he only &s;tayed to obtain her pardon, and permi&s;&s;ion to be early the next morning, and then, though &s;till &s;lowly and reluctantly, he left her.</P>
<P>Scarce was Cecilia again alone, but the whole of what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;eemed a vi&s;ion of her imagination. That Delvile &s;hould be at Bury, that he &s;hould vi&s;it her at Mrs. Charlton's, &s;urpri&s;e her by her&s;elf, and di&s;|cover her mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, appeared &s;o &s;trange and &s;o incredible, that, occupied rather by wonder than thinking, &s;he con|tinued almo&s;t motionle&s;s in the place where he had left her, till Mrs. Charlton &s;ent to
<PB N="42" REF="41">
reque&s;t that &s;he would return to the hou&s;e. She then enquired if any body was with her, and being an&s;wered in the negative, obeyed the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, with a &s;mile of much meaning, hoped &s;he had had a plea&s;ant walk: but Cecilia &s;eriou&s;ly remon&s;trated on the dangerous imprudence &s;he had com|mitted in &s;uffering her to be &s;o unguardedly &s;urpri&s;ed. Mrs. Charlton, however, more anxious for her future and &s;olid happine&s;s, than for her pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ions and de|licacy, repented not the &s;tep &s;he had taken; and when &s;he gathered from Cecilia the &s;ub&s;tance of what had pa&s;t, unmindful of the expo&s;tulations which accompanied it, &s;he thought with exultation that the &s;ud|den meeting &s;he had permitted, would now, by making known to each their mutual af|fection, determine them to defer no longer a union upon which their mutual peace of mind &s;o much depended. And Cecilia, finding &s;he had been thus betrayed de|&s;ignedly, not inadvertently, could hardly reproach her zeal, though &s;he lamented its indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked by what means he had obtained admi&s;&s;ion, and made him&s;elf known; and heard that he had enquired at the door for Mi&s;s Beverley, and, having &s;ent in his name, was &s;hewn into the par|lour,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
where Mrs. Charlton, much plea&s;ed with his appearance, had &s;uddenly con|ceived the little plan which &s;he had exe|cuted, of contriving a &s;urpri&s;e for Cecilia, from which &s;he rationally expected the very con&s;equences that en&s;ued, though the im|mediate means &s;he had not conjectured.</P>
<P>The account was &s;till un&s;atisfactory to Cecilia, who could frame to her&s;elf no po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for a vi&s;it &s;o extraordinary, and &s;o totally incon&s;i&s;tent with his declar|ations and re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>This, however, was a matter of but lit|tle moment, compared with the other &s;ub|jects to which the interview had given ri&s;e; Delvile, upon whom &s;o long, though &s;e|cretly, her deare&s;t hopes of happine&s;s had re&s;ted, was now become acquainted with his power, and knew him&s;elf the ma&s;ter of her de&s;tiny; he had quitted her avow|edly to decide what it &s;hould be, &s;ince his pre&s;ent &s;ubject of deliberation included her fate in his own: the next morning he was to call, and acquaint her with his de|cree, not doubting her concurrence which ever way he re&s;olved.</P>
<P>A &s;ubjection &s;o undue, and which &s;he could not but con&s;ider as di&s;graceful, both &s;hocked and afflicted her; and the re|flection that the man who of all men &s;he
<PB N="44" REF="43">
preferred, was acquainted with her pre|ference, yet he&s;itated whether to accept or abandon her, mortified and provoked her, alternately, occupied her thoughts the whole night, and kept her from peace and from re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY the next morning, Delvile again made his appearance. Cecilia, who was at breakfa&s;t with Mrs. and Mi&s;s Charltons, received him with the mo&s;t painful confu&s;ion, and he was evidently him&s;elf in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t pertubation. Mrs. Charlton made a pretence almo&s;t im|mediately for &s;ending away both her grand|daughters, and then, without taking the trouble of devi&s;ing one for her&s;elf, aro&s;e and followed them, though Cecilia made &s;undry &s;igns of &s;olicitation that &s;he would &s;tay.</P>
<P>Finding her&s;elf now alone with him, &s;he ha&s;tily, and without knowing what &s;he &s;aid, cried, <Q REND="inline">"How is Mrs. Delvile, Sir? Is &s;he &s;till at Bri&s;tol?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At Bri&s;tol? no; have you never heard &s;he is returned to Delvile-Ca&s;tle?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, true!&mdash;I meant Delvile-Ca&s;tle,&mdash;but I hope &s;he found &s;ome benefit from the waters?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She had not, I believe, any occa&s;ion to try them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
Cecilia, a&s;hamed of the&s;e two following mi&s;takes, coloured high, but ventured not again to &s;peak: and Delvile, who &s;eemed big with &s;omething he feared to utter, aro&s;e, and walked for a few in&s;tants about the room; after which, exclaiming aloud <Q REND="inline">"How vain is every plan which pa&s;&s;es the pre&s;ent hour!"</Q> He advanced to Cecilia, who pre|tended to be looking at &s;ome work, and, &s;eating him&s;elf next her, <Q REND="inline">"when we parted ye&s;terday,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I pre&s;umed to &s;ay one night alone &s;hould be given to deliber|ation,&mdash;and to-day, this very day to ac|tion!&mdash;but I forgot that though in deliber|ating I had only my&s;elf to con&s;ult, in acting I was not &s;o independent; and that when my own doubts were &s;atisfied, and my own re&s;olutions taken, other doubts and other re&s;olutions mu&s;t be con&s;idered, by which my purpo&s;ed proceedings might be re|tarded, might perhaps be wholly pre|vented!"</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, but Cecilia, unable to con|jecture to what he was leading, made not any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon you, madam,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"all that is good or evil of my future life, as far as relates to its happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, will, from this very hour, almo&s;t &s;olely de|pend: yet much as I rely upon your good|ne&s;s, and &s;uperior as I know you to trifling
<PB N="47" REF="46">
or affectation, what I now come to propo&s;e&mdash;to petition&mdash;to entreat&mdash;I cannot &s;ummon courage to mention, from a dread of alarm|ing you!"</Q></P>
<P>What next, thought Cecilia, trembling at this introduction, is preparing for me! does he mean to a&s;k <HI>me</HI> to &s;olicit Mrs. Delvile's con&s;ent! or from my&s;elf mu&s;t he receive commands that we &s;hould never meet more!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"deter|mined not to &s;peak to me? Is &s;he bent up|on &s;ilence only to intimidate me? Indeed if &s;he knew how greatly I re&s;pect her, &s;he would honour me with more confidence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"do you mean to make your tour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never!"</Q> cried he, with fervour, <Q REND="inline">"un|le&s;s bani&s;hed by <HI>you,</HI> never!&mdash;no, lovelie&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, I can now quit you no more! Fortune, beauty, worth and &s;weetne&s;s I had power to relinqui&s;h, and &s;evere as was the ta&s;k, I compelled my&s;elf to perform it,&mdash;but when to the&s;e I find joined &s;o attractive a &s;oftne&s;s,&mdash;a pity for my &s;ufferings &s;o un|expectedly gentle&mdash;no! &s;weete&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, I can quit you no more!"</Q> And then, &s;eizing her hand, with yet greater energy, he went on, <Q REND="inline">"I here,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"offer you my vows, I here own you &s;ole arbitre&s;s of my &s;ate! I give you not merely the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart,&mdash;that, indeed,
<PB N="48" REF="47">
I had no power to with-hold from you,&mdash;but I give you the direction of my conduct, I entreat you to become my coun&s;ellor and guide. Will Mi&s;s Beverley accept &s;uch an office? Will &s;he deign to li&s;ten to &s;uch a prayer?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried Cecilia, involuntarily de|lighted to find that &s;uch was the re&s;ult of his night's deliberation, <Q REND="inline">"I am mo&s;t ready to give you my coun&s;el; which I now do,&mdash;that you &s;et off for the continent to-morrow morning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O how malicious!"</Q> cried he, half laughing, <Q REND="inline">"yet not &s;o immediately do I even reque&s;t your coun&s;el; &s;omething mu&s;t fir&s;t be done to qualify you for giving it: penetration, &s;kill and under&s;tanding, how|ever amply you po&s;&s;e&s;s them, are not &s;uffi|cient to fit you for the charge; &s;omething &s;till more is requi&s;ite, you mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with fuller powers, you mu&s;t have a right le&s;s di&s;putable, and a title, that not alone, in|clination, not even judgment alone mu&s;t &s;anctify,&mdash;but which law mu&s;t enforce, and rites the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;upport!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, deeply blu&s;hing, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t be content to forbear giving any coun&s;el at all, if the quali|fications for it are &s;o difficult of acquire|ment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Re&s;ent not my pre&s;umption,"</Q> cried
<PB N="49" REF="48">
he, <Q REND="inline">"my beloved Mi&s;s Beverley, but let the &s;everity of my recent &s;ufferings palliate my pre&s;ent temerity; for where affliction has been deep and &s;erious, cau&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary mi&s;ery will find little encou|ragement; and mine has been &s;erious in|deed! Sweetly, then, permit me, in pro|portion to its bitterne&s;s, to rejoice in the &s;oft rever&s;e which now flatters me with its approach."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, aba&s;hed and unea&s;y, uncertain of what was to follow, and unwilling to &s;peak till more a&s;&s;ured, pau&s;ed, and then abruptly exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid Mrs. Charlton is waiting for me,"</Q> and would have hurried away: but Delvile, almo&s;t forcibly preventing her, compelled her to &s;tay; and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation, on his &s;ide the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned, and on hers the mo&s;t confu&s;ed, obtained from her, what, indeed, after the &s;urpri&s;e of the preceding evening &s;he could but ill deny, a frank con|firmation of his power over her heart, and an ingenuous, though reluctant acknowledg|ment, how long he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>This confe&s;&s;ion, made, as affairs now &s;tood, wholly in oppo&s;ition to her judge|ment, was torn from her by an impetuous urgency which &s;he had not pre&s;ence of mind to re&s;i&s;t, and with which Delvile, when particularly animated, had long been
<PB N="50" REF="49">
accu&s;tomed to overpower all oppo&s;ition. The joy with which he heard it, though but little mixed with wonder, was as violent as the eagerne&s;s with which he had &s;ought it; yet it was not of long duration, a &s;udden, and mo&s;t painful recollection pre&s;ently quelled it, and even in the mid&s;t of his rap|turous acknowledgements, &s;eemed to &s;trike him to the heart.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;oon perceiving both in his counte|nance and manner an alteration that &s;hocked her, bitterly repented an avowal &s;he could never recall, and looked agha&s;t with expec|tation and dread.</P>
<P>Delvile, who with quickne&s;s &s;aw a change of expre&s;&s;ion in her of which in him&s;elf he was uncon&s;cious, exclaimed, with much emotion <Q REND="inline">"Oh how tran&s;ient is human feli|city! How rapidly fly tho&s;e rare and exqui|&s;ite moments in which it is perfect! Ah! &s;weete&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, what words &s;hall I find to &s;often what I have now to reveal! to tell you that, after goodne&s;s, candour, genero&s;ity &s;uch as yours, a reque&s;t, a &s;up|plication remains yet to be uttered that ba|ni&s;hes me, if refu&s;ed, from your pre&s;ence for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely di&s;mayed, de&s;ired to know what it was: an evident dread of of|fending her kept him &s;ome time from pro|ceeding, but at length, after repeatedly ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="51" REF="50">
his fears of her di&s;approbation, and a repugnance even on his own part to the very mea&s;ure he was obliged to urge, he acknowledged that all his hopes of being ever united to her, re&s;ted upon obtaining her con&s;ent to an immediate and &s;ecret marriage.</P>
<P>Cecilia, thunder&s;truck by this declara|ation remained for a few in&s;tants too much confounded to &s;peak; but when he was be|ginning an explanatory apology, &s;he &s;tarted up, and glowing with indignation, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I had flattered my&s;elf, Sir, that both my cha|racter and my conduct, independent of my &s;ituation in life, would have exempted me at all times from a propo&s;al which I &s;hall ever think my&s;elf degraded by having heard."</Q></P>
<P>And then &s;he was again going, but Delvile &s;till preventing her, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I knew too well how much you would be alarmed, and &s;uch was my dread of your di&s;plea&s;ure that it had power even to embitter the hap|pine&s;s I &s;ought with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, and to render your conde&s;cen&s;ion in&s;ufficient to en&s;ure it. Yet wonder not at my &s;cheme; wild as it may appear, it is the re&s;ult of de|liberation, and cen&s;urable as it may &s;eem, it &s;prings not from unworthy motives."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever may be your motives with re&s;pect to your&s;elf, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia,
<PB N="52" REF="51">
<Q REND="inline">"with re&s;pect to me they mu&s;t certainly be di&s;graceful; I will not, therefore, li&s;ten to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You wrong me cruelly,"</Q> cried he, with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"and a moment's reflection mu&s;t tell you that however di&s;tinct may be our honour or our di&s;grace in every other in&s;tance, in that by which we &s;hould be united, they mu&s;t inevitably be the &s;ame: and far &s;ooner would I voluntarily relinqui&s;h you, than be my&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary to tainting that delicacy of which the un&s;ullied pu|rity has been the chief &s;ource of my ad|miration."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, reproach|fully, <Q REND="inline">"have you mentioned to me &s;uch a project?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Circum&s;tances the mo&s;t &s;ingular, and nece&s;&s;ity the mo&s;t unavoidable,"</Q> he an&s;wer|ed, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould alone have ever tempted me to form it. No longer ago than ye&s;terday morning, I believed my&s;elf incapaple of even wi&s;hing it; but extraordinary &s;ituations call for extraordinary re&s;olutions, and in private as well as public life, palliate, at lea&s;t, ex|traordinary actions. Alas! the propo&s;al which &s;o much offends you is my final re|&s;ource! it is the &s;ole barrier between my&s;elf and perpetual mi&s;ery!&mdash;the only expedient in my power to &s;ave me from eternally part|ing with you!&mdash;for I am now cruelly com|pelled
<PB N="53" REF="52">
to confe&s;s, that my family, I am cer|tain, will never con&s;ent to our union!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither, then, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with great &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"will I! The di&s;dain I may meet with I pretend not to retort, but wilfully to encounter, were meanly to de|&s;erve it. I will enter into no family in op|po&s;ition to its wi&s;hes, I will con&s;ent to no alliance that may expo&s;e me to indignity. Nothing is &s;o contagious as contempt!&mdash;The example of your friends might work powerfully upon your&s;elf; and who &s;hall dare a&s;&s;ure me you would not catch the infec|tion?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"But what, Sir, is my &s;ecurity to the contrary? Have you not this mo|ment avowed that but ye&s;terday you held in abhorrence the very plan that to-day you propo&s;e? And may you not to-morrow re|&s;ume again the &s;ame opinion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cruel Mi&s;s Beverley! how unju&s;t is this inference! If ye&s;terday I di&s;approved what to-day I recommend, a little recollec|tion mu&s;t &s;urely tell you why: and that not my opinion, but my &s;ituation is changed."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">
The con&s;cious Cecilia here turned away her head; too certain he alluded to the di&s;|covery of her partiality.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you not your&s;elf,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"witne&s;&s;ed the &s;teadine&s;s of my mind? Have you not beheld me fly, when I had power to pur&s;ue, and avoid, when I had opportunity to &s;eek you?

<P><Q REND="inline">"But what,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"was the con|&s;tancy which brought you into Suffolk?&mdash;When all occa&s;ion was over for our meeting any more, when you told me you were go|ing abroad, and took leave of me for-ever,&mdash;where, then, was your &s;teadine&s;s in this unnece&s;&s;ary journey?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have a care,"</Q> cried he, half &s;miling, and taking a letter from his pocket, <Q REND="inline">"have a care, upon this point, how you provoke me to &s;hew my ju&s;tification!"</Q></P>

<P>Cecilia, much alarmed, held out her hand for the letter; and looking fir&s;t at the end was much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the name of Biddulph. She then ca&s;t her eye over the

beginning, and when &s;he &s;aw her own name, read the following paragraph.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, as you doubtle&s;s know, is returned into Suffolk; every body here &s;aw her with the utmo&s;t &s;urprize; from the moment I had heard of her re&s;idence in Delvile-Ca&s;tle, I had given her up for lo&s;t: but, upon her unexpected appearance among us again, I was weak enough once more to make trial of her heart. I &s;oon found, however, that the pain of a &s;econd rejection <HI>you</HI> might have &s;pared me, and that though &s;he had quitted Delvile-Ca&s;tle, &s;he had not for nothing entered it: at the &s;ound of your name, &s;he blu&s;hes; at the mention of your illne&s;s, &s;he turns pale; and the dog you have given her, which I recollected immediately, is her darling companion. Oh happy Delvile! yet &s;o lovely a conque&s;t you abandon.&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia could read no more; the letter dropt from her hand: to find her&s;elf thus by her own emotions betrayed, made her in|&s;tantly conclude &s;he was univer&s;ally di&s;|covered: and turning &s;ick at the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, all her &s;pirit for&s;ook her, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven,"</Q> cried Delvile, ex|tremely &s;hocked, <Q REND="inline">"what has thus affected

<P><Q REND="inline">"I will go, I will obey you in every thing!"</Q> cried he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"tell me but when I may return, and when you will &s;uf|fer me to explain to you all the motives of my propo&s;al?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never, never!"</Q> cried &s;he, with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ufficiently lowered al|ready, but never will I intrude my&s;elf into a family that di&s;dains me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Di&s;dains? No, you are revered in it! who could di&s;dain you! That fatal clau&s;e alone&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, pray leave me; indeed I cannot hear you; I am unfit for argument, and all rea&s;oning now is nothing le&s;s than cruelty."</Q></P>

Her e&s;teem, therefore, to me is as precious as her affec|tion, for how can I hope her friend&s;hip in the winter of my days, if their brighter and gayer &s;ea&s;on is darkened by doubts of my integrity? All &s;hall be clear and expli|cit; no latent cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hall di&s;|turb our future quiet: we will now be &s;in|cere, that hereafter we may be ea&s;y; and &s;weetly in unclouded felicity, time &s;hall glide away imperceptibly, and we will make an intere&s;t with each other in the gaiety of youth, to bear with the infirmities of age, and alleviate them by kindne&s;s and &s;ympa|thy.

<P>She then very earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted upon his going; and after a thou&s;and times taking leave and returning, promi&s;ing obedience, yet pur&s;uing his own way, he at length &s;aid if &s;he would con&s;ent to receive a letter from
<PB N="58" REF="57">
him, he would endeavour to commit what he had to communicate to paper, &s;ince their mutual agitation made him unable to explain him&s;elf with clearne&s;s, and rather hurt his cau&s;e than a&s;&s;i&s;ted it, by leaving all his arguments unfini&s;hed and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>Another di&s;pute now aro&s;e; Cecilia pro|te&s;ting &s;he would receive no letter, and hear nothing upon the &s;ubject; and Delvile im|petuou&s;ly declaring he would &s;ubmit to no award without being fir&s;t heard. At length he conquered, and at length he departed.</P>
<P>Cecilia then felt her whole heart &s;ink within her at the unhappine&s;s of her &s;ituation. She con&s;idered her&s;elf now condemned to refu&s;e Delvile her&s;elf, as the only condition upon which he even &s;olicited her favour, neither the &s;trictne&s;s of her principles, nor the delicacy of her mind, would &s;uffer her to accept. Her di&s;plea&s;ure at the propo&s;al had been wholly unaffected, and &s;he re|garded it as an injury to her character ever to have received it; yet that Delvile's pride of heart &s;hould give way to his pa&s;&s;ion, that he &s;hould love her with &s;o much fond|ne&s;s as to relinqui&s;h for her the ambitious &s;chemes of his family, and even that darl|ing name which &s;o lately &s;eemed annexed to his exi&s;tence, were circum&s;tances to which &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible, and proofs of tenderne&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="58">
and regard which &s;he had thought in|compatible with the general &s;pirit of his di&s;po&s;ition. Yet however by the&s;e &s;he was gratified, &s;he re&s;olved never to comply with &s;o humiliating a mea&s;ure, but to wait the con&s;ent of his friends, or renounce him for ever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mrs. Charlton was ac|quainted with the departure of young Delvile, &s;he returned to Cecilia, impatient to be informed what had pa&s;&s;ed. The nar|ration &s;he heard both hurt and a&s;toni&s;hed her; that Cecilia, the Heire&s;s of &s;uch a for|tune, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;o much beauty, de|&s;cended of a worthy family, and formed and educated to grace a noble one, &s;hould be rejected by people to whom her wealth would be mo&s;t u&s;eful, and only in &s;ecret have their alliance propo&s;ed to her, &s;he deemed an indignity that called for nothing but re&s;entment, and approved and enforced the re&s;olution of her young friend to re&s;i&s;t all &s;olicitations which Mr. and Mrs. Delvile did not &s;econd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About two hours after Delvile was gone, his letter arrived. Cecilia opened it with trepidation, and read as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="61" REF="60">
<HEAD>TO MISS BEVERLEY. </HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>September 20, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>What could be the apprehen&s;ions, the &s;u&s;picions of Mi&s;s Beverley when &s;o ear|ne&s;tly &s;he prohibited my writing? From a temper &s;o unguarded as mine could &s;he fear any &s;ubtlety of doctrine? Is my character &s;o little known to her that &s;he can think me capable of craft or duplicity? Had I even the de&s;ire, I have neither the addre&s;s nor the patience to practi&s;e them; no, lovelie&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, though &s;ometimes by vehe|mence I may incautiou&s;ly offend, by &s;o|phi&s;try, believe me, I never &s;hall injure: my ambition, as I have told you, is to con|vince, not beguile, and my arguments &s;hall be &s;imple as my profe&s;&s;ions &s;hall be &s;incere.</P>
<P>Yet how again may I venture to mention a propo&s;al which &s;o lately almo&s;t before you had heard you rejected? Suffer me, how|ever, to a&s;&s;ure you it re&s;ulted neither from in&s;en&s;ibility to your delicacy, nor to my own duty; I made it, on the contrary, with that reluctance and timidity which were given me by an apprehen&s;ion that both &s;eemed to be offended by it:&mdash;but alas! al|ready I have &s;aid what with grief I mu&s;t re|peat, I have no re&s;ource, no alternative, be|tween receiving the honour of your hand in &s;ecret or foregoing you for-ever.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61">
You will wonder, you may well wonder at &s;uch a declaration; and again that &s;evere renunciation with which you wounded me, will tremble on your lips,&mdash;Oh there let it &s;top! nor let the air again be agitated with &s;ounds &s;o di&s;cordant!</P>
<P>In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore my&s;elf from you at Delvile|Ca&s;tle, I confe&s;&s;ed to you the rea&s;on of my flight, and I determined to &s;ee you no more, I named not to you, then, my family, the potency of my own objections again&s;t daring to &s;olicit your favour rendering their's im|material: my own are now wholly removed,&mdash;but their's remain in full force.</P>
<P>My father, de&s;cended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is un&s;ubdued in pride, con&s;iders him&s;elf as the guardian of the honour of his hou&s;e, to which he holds the name of his ance&s;tors in&s;eparably annexed: my mother, born of the &s;ame fa|mily, and bred to the &s;ame ideas, has &s;trengthened this opinion by giving it the &s;anction of her own.</P>
<P>Such being their &s;entiments, you will not, madam, be &s;urpri&s;ed that their only &s;on, the &s;ole inheritor of their fortune, and &s;ole object of their expectations, &s;hould early have admitted the &s;ame. Indeed al|mo&s;t the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on I was taught was that of reverencing the family from which I am de|&s;cended,
<PB N="63" REF="62">
and the name to which I am born. I was bid con&s;ider my&s;elf as its only re|maining &s;upport, and &s;edulou&s;ly in&s;tructed neither to act nor think but with a view to its aggrandizement and dignity.</P>
<P>Thus, unchecked by our&s;elves, and un|controuled by the world, this haughty &s;elf|importance acquired by time a &s;trength, and by mutual encouragement a firmne&s;s, which Mi&s;s Beverley alone could po&s;&s;ibly, I believe, have &s;haken! What, therefore, was my &s;ecret alarm, when fir&s;t I was con|&s;cious of the force of her attractions, and found my mind wholly occupied with ad|miration of her excellencies! All that pride could demand, and all to which ambition could a&s;pire, all that happine&s;s could covet, or the mo&s;t &s;crupulous delicacy exact, in her I found united; and while my heart was en&s;laved by her charms, my under&s;tanding exulted in its fetters.&mdash;Yet to forfeit my name, to give up for-ever a family which upon me re&s;ted its late&s;t expectations,&mdash;Honour, I thought forbad it, propriety and manly &s;pirit revolted at the &s;acrifice. The renunciation of my birth-right &s;eemed a de|&s;ertion of the po&s;t in which I was &s;tationed: I forebore, therefore, even in my wi&s;hes, to &s;olicit your favour, and vigorou&s;ly deter|mined to fly you as dangerous to my peace, becau&s;e unattainable without di&s;honour.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="63">
Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time I received Biddulph's letter; in three days I was to leave England; my father, with much per&s;ua&s;ion, had con|&s;ented to my departure; my mother, who penetrated into my motives, had never op|po&s;ed it: but how great was the change wrought upon my mind by reading that let|ter! my &s;teadine&s;s for&s;ook me, my re&s;olu|tion wavered; yet I thought him deceived, and attributed his &s;u&s;picions to jealou&s;y: but &s;till, Fidel I knew was mi&s;&s;ing&mdash;and to hear he was your darling companion&mdash;was it po&s;&s;ible to quit England in a &s;tate of &s;uch uncertainty? to be harra&s;&s;ed in di&s;tant cli|mates with conjectures I might then never &s;atisfy? No; I told my friends I mu&s;t vi&s;it Biddulph before I left the kingdom, and promi&s;ing to return to them in three or four days, I ha&s;tily &s;et out for Suffolk, and re&s;ted not till I arrived at Mrs. Charl|ton's.</P>
<P>What a &s;cene there awaited me! to be|hold the loved mi&s;tre&s;s of my heart, the op|po&s;ed, yet re&s;i&s;tle&s;s object of my fonde&s;t admiration, care&s;&s;ing an animal &s;he knew to be mine, mourning over him his ma&s;ter's ill health, and &s;weetly recommending to him fidelity,&mdash;Ah! forgive the retro&s;pection, I will dwell on it no longer. Little, in|deed, had I imagined with what &s;oftne&s;s the
<PB N="65" REF="64">
dignity of Mi&s;s Beverley was blended, though always con&s;cious that her virtues, her attractions, and her excellencies, would reflect lu&s;tre upon the highe&s;t &s;tation to which human grandeur could rai&s;e her, and would &s;till be more exalted than her rank, though that were the mo&s;t eminent upon earth.&mdash;And had there been a thou|&s;and, and ten thou&s;and ob&s;tacles to oppo&s;e my addre&s;&s;ing her, vigourou&s;ly and un|dauntedly would I have combated with them all, in preference to yielding to this &s;ingle objection!</P>
<P>Let not the frankne&s;s of this declaration irritate you, but rather let it &s;erve to con|vince you of the &s;incerity of what follows: various as are the calamities of life which may render me mi&s;erable, YOU only, among even its cho&s;en felicities, have power to make me happy. Fame, honours, wealth, ambition, were in&s;ufficient without you; all chance of internal peace, and every &s;ofter hope is now centered in your favour, and to lo&s;e you, from whatever cau&s;e, en|&s;ures me wretchedne&s;s unmitigated.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect therefore to my&s;elf, the die is finally ca&s;t, and the conflict between bo|&s;om felicity and family pride is deliberately over. This name which &s;o vainly I have cheri&s;hed and &s;o painfully &s;upported, I now find inadequate to recompen&s;e me for the
<PB N="66" REF="65">
&s;acrifice which its pre&s;ervation requires. I part with it, I own, with regret that the &s;urrender is nece&s;&s;ary; yet is it rather an imaginary than an actual evil, and though a deep wound to pride, no offence to mo|rality.</P>
<P>Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, confe&s;&s;ed my perplexities, acknow|ledged my vain-glory, and expo&s;ed with equal &s;incerity the &s;ources of my doubts, and the motives of my deci&s;ion: but now, indeed, how to proceed I know not; the difficulties which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate, and the petition I have to urge I have &s;carce courage to mention.</P>
<P>My family, mi&s;taking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, have long planned a &s;plendid connection for me, to which though my invariable repugnance has &s;topt any advances, their wi&s;hes and their views immovably adhere. I am but too certain they will now li&s;ten to no other. I dread, therefore, to make a trial where I de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, I know not how to ri&s;k a prayer with tho&s;e who may &s;ilence me by a command.</P>
<P>In a &s;ituation &s;o de&s;perate, what then re|mains? Mu&s;t I make an application with a certainty of rejection, and then mock all authority by acting in defiance of it? Or, harder ta&s;k yet! relinqui&s;h my deare&s;t hopes
<PB N="67" REF="66">
when no longer per&s;uaded of their impro|priety? Ah! &s;weete&s;t Mi&s;s Beverley, end the &s;truggle at once! My happine&s;s, my peace, are wholly in your power, for the moment of our union &s;ecures them for life.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem to you &s;trange that I &s;hould thus purpo&s;e to brave the friends whom I venture not to entreat; but from my know|ledge of their characters and &s;entiments I am certain I have no other re&s;ource. Their favou|rite principles were too early imbibed to be now at this late &s;ea&s;on eradicated. Slaves that we all are to habits, and dupes to appear|ances, jealous guardians of our pride, to which our comfort is &s;acrificed, and even our virtue made &s;ub&s;ervient, what convic|tion can be offered by rea&s;on, to notions that exi&s;t but by prejudice? They have been cheri&s;hed too long for rhetorick to re|move them, they can only be expelled by all-powerful Nece&s;&s;ity. Life is, indeed, too brief, and &s;ucce&s;s to precarious, to tru&s;t, in any ca&s;e where happine&s;s is concerned, the extirpation of deep-rooted and darling opinions, to the &s;low-working influence of argument and di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Yet bigotted as they are to rank and fa|mily, they adore Mi&s;s Beverley, and though their con&s;ent to the forfeiture of their name might for-ever be denied, when once they beheld her the head and ornament of their
<PB N="68" REF="67">
hou&s;e, her elegance and accompli&s;hments joined to the &s;plendour of her fortune, would &s;peedily make them forget the plans which now wholly ab&s;orb them. Their &s;en&s;e of honour is in nothing inferior to their &s;en&s;e of high birth; your conde&s;cen&s;ion, there|fore, would be felt by them in its fulle&s;t force, and though, during their fir&s;t &s;ur|prize, they might be irritated again&s;t their &s;on, they would make it the &s;tudy of their lives that the lady who for him had done &s;o much, &s;hould never, through their means, repine for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>With regard to &s;ettlements, the privacy of our union would not affect them: one Confident we mu&s;t unavoidably tru&s;t, and I would depo&s;it in the hands of whatever per&s;on you would name, a bond by which I would engage my&s;elf to &s;ettle both your fortune and my own, according to the arbi|tration of our mutual friends.</P>
<P>The time for &s;ecrecy though painful would be &s;hort, and even from the altar, if you de&s;ired it, I would ha&s;ten to Delvile|Ca&s;tle. Not one of my friends &s;hould you &s;ee till they waited upon you them&s;elves to &s;olicit your pre&s;ence at their hou&s;e, till our re&s;idence el&s;ewhere was fixed.</P>
<P>Oh lovelie&s;t Cecilia, from a dream of a hapine&s;s &s;o &s;weet awaken me not! from a plan of felicity &s;o attractive turn not away!
<PB N="69" REF="68">
If one part of it is unplea&s;ant, reject not therefore all; and &s;ince without &s;ome draw|back no earthly bli&s;s is attainable, do not, by a refinement too &s;crupulous for the &s;hort period of our exi&s;tence, deny your&s;elf that delight which your benevolence will afford you, in &s;natching from the pangs of una|vailing regret and mi&s;ery, the gratefulle&s;t of men in the</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Cecilia read and re-read this letter, but with a perturbation of mind that made her little able to weigh its contents. Paragraph by paragraph her &s;entiments varied, and her determination was changed: the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of his &s;upplication now &s;oftened her into compliance, the ackowledged pride of his family now irritated her into re&s;ent|ment, and the confe&s;&s;ion of his own regret now &s;ickened her into de&s;pondence. She meant in an immediate an&s;wer to have writ|ten a final di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; but though proof again&s;t his entreaties, becau&s;e not convinced by his arguments, there was &s;omething in the conclu&s;ion of his letter that &s;taggered her re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">
Tho&s;e &s;cruples and that refinement again&s;t which he warned her, &s;he her&s;elf thought might be over&s;trained, and to gra|tify unnece&s;&s;ary punctilio, the &s;hort period of exi&s;tence be rendered cau&s;ele&s;sly unhap|py. He had truly &s;aid that their union would be no offence to morality, and with re&s;pect merely to pride, why &s;hould that be &s;pared? He knew he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her heart, &s;he had long been certain of his, her cha|racter had early gained the affection of his mother, and the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice which an income &s;uch as her's mu&s;t do the family, would &s;oon be felt too powerfully to make her connection with it regretted.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections were &s;o plea&s;ant &s;he knew not how to di&s;card them; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that her &s;ecret was betrayed not only to him&s;elf, but to Mr. Biddulph, Lord Ernolf, Lady Honoria Pemberton, and Mrs. Delvile, gave them additional force, by making it probable &s;he was yet more widely &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>But &s;till her delicacy and her principles revolted again&s;t a conduct of which the &s;ecrecy &s;eemed to imply the impropriety. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;hall I meet Mrs. Delvile,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"after an action &s;o clande&s;tine? How, after prai&s;e &s;uch as &s;he has be&s;towed upon me, bear the &s;everity of her eye, when &s;he thinks I have &s;educed from her the obe|dience
<PB N="71" REF="70">
of her &s;on! A &s;on who is the &s;ole &s;olace and fir&s;t hope of her exi&s;tence, who&s;e virtues make all her happine&s;s, and who&s;e filial piety is her only glory!&mdash;And well may &s;he glory in a &s;on &s;uch as Delvile! Nobly has he exerted him&s;elf in &s;ituations the mo&s;t difficult, his family and his ideas of honour he has preferred to his peace and health, he has fulfilled with &s;pirit and in|tegrity the various, the conflicting duties of life. Even now, perhaps, in his pre|&s;ent application, he may merely think him|&s;elf bound by knowing me no longer free, and his generous &s;en&s;ibility to the weakne&s;s he has di&s;covered, without any of the con|viction to which he pretends, may have oc|ca&s;ioned this propo&s;al!"</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ugge&s;tion &s;o mortifying again changed her determination; and the tears of Hen|rietta Belfield, with the letter which &s;he had &s;urprized in her hand recurring to her me|mory, all her thoughts turned once more upon rejecting him for-ever.</P>
<P>In this fluctuating &s;tate of mind &s;he found writing impracticable; while uncertain what to wi&s;h, to decide was impo&s;&s;ible. She di&s;dained coquetry, &s;he was &s;u|perior to trifling, the candour and open|ne&s;s of Delvile had merited all her &s;in|cerity, and therefore while any doubt re|mained, with her&s;elf, &s;he held it unworthy her character to tell him &s;he had none.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="71">
Mrs. Charlton, upon reading the letter, became again the advocate of Delvile; the frankne&s;s with which he had &s;tated his difficulties a&s;&s;ured her of his probity, and by explaining his former conduct, &s;atisfied her with the rectitude of his fu|ture intentions. <Q REND="inline">"Do not, therefore, my dear child,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"become the pa|rent of your own mi&s;ery by refu&s;ing him; he de&s;erves you alike from his principles and his affection, and the ta&s;k would both be long and melancholy to di&s;engage him from your heart. I &s;ee not, however, the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for the di&s;grace of a private marriage; I know not any family to which you would not be an honour, and tho&s;e who feel not your merit, are little worth plea&s;ing. Let Mr. Delvile, there|fore, apply openly to his friends, and if they refu&s;e their con&s;ent, be their preju|dices their reward. You are freed from all obligations where caprice only can rai&s;e ob|jections, and you may then, in the face of the world, vindicate your choice."</Q></P>
<P>The wi&s;hes of Cecilia accorded with this advice, though the general tenour of Del|vile's letter gave her little rea&s;on to expect he would follow it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A DISCUSSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE day pa&s;t away, and Cecilia had yet written no an&s;wer; the evening came, and her re&s;olution was &s;till unfixed. Delvile, at length, was again announced; and though &s;he dreaded tru&s;ting her&s;elf to his entreaties, the nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tening &s;ome deci&s;ion deterred her from refu&s;ing to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton was with her when he en|tered the room; he attempted at fir&s;t &s;ome general conver&s;ation, though the anxiety of his mind was &s;trongly pictured upon his face. Cecilia endeavoured al&s;o to talk upon common topics, though her evident embarra&s;&s;ment &s;poke the ab&s;ence of her thoughts.</P>
<P>Delvile at length, unable any longer to bear &s;u&s;pence, turned to Mrs. Charlton, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are probably acquainted, madam, with the purport of the letter I had the honour of &s;ending to Mi&s;s Beverley this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the old lady,
<PB N="74" REF="73">
<Q REND="inline">"and you need de&s;ire little more than that her opinion of it may be as favourable as mine."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile bowed and thanked her; and looking at Cecilia, to whom he ventured not to &s;peak, he perceived in her counte|nance a mixture of dejection and confu&s;ion, that told him whatever might be her opi|nion, it had by no means encrea&s;ed her happine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But why, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould you be thus &s;ure of the di&s;appro|bation of your friends? had you not better hear what they have to &s;ay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I <HI>know,</HI> madam, what they have to &s;ay,"</Q> returned he; <Q REND="inline">"for their language and their principles have been invariable from my birth: to apply to them, therefore, for a conce&s;&s;ion which I am certain they will not grant, were only a cruel device to lay all my mi&s;ery to their account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if they are &s;o perver&s;e, they de|&s;erve from you nothing better,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton; <Q REND="inline">"&s;peak to them, however; you will then have done your duty; and if they are ob&s;tinately unju&s;t, you will have ac|quired a right to act for your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To mock their authority,"</Q> an&s;wered Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"would be more offen&s;ive than to oppo&s;e it: to &s;olicit their approbation, and then act in defiance of it, might ju&s;tly
<PB N="75" REF="74">
provoke their indignation.&mdash;No; if at la&s;t I am reduced to appeal to them, by their deci&s;ion I mu&s;t abide."</Q></P>
<P>To this Mrs. Charlton could make no an&s;wer, and in a few minutes &s;he left the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is &s;uch, al&s;o,"</Q> &s;aid Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"the opinion of Mi&s;s Beverley? has &s;he doomed me to be wretched, and does &s;he wi&s;h that doom to be &s;igned by my neare&s;t friends!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If your friends, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"are &s;o undoubtedly inflexible, it were madne&s;s, upon any plan, to ri&s;k their di&s;|plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To entreaty,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"they will be inflexible, but not to forgivene&s;s. My father, though haughty, dearly, even pa&s;&s;ionately loves me; my mother, though high-&s;pirited, is ju&s;t, noble, and generous. She is, indeed, the mo&s;t exalted of women, and her power over my mind I am unac|cu&s;tomed to re&s;i&s;t. Mi&s;s Beverley alone &s;eems born to be her daughter&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> interrupted Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"as her daughter &s;he rejects me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She loves, &s;he adores you!"</Q> cried he, warmly; <Q REND="inline">"and were I not certain &s;he feels your excellencies as they ought to be felt, my veneration for you <HI>both</HI> &s;hould even yet &s;pare you my pre&s;ent &s;upplication. But you would become, I am certain, the fir&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="75">
ble&s;&s;ing of her life; in you &s;he would be|hold all the felicity of her &s;on,&mdash;his re&s;tor|ation to health, to his country, to his friends!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with emotion, <Q REND="inline">"how deep a trench of real mi&s;ery do you &s;ink, in order to rai&s;e this pile of fancied happine&s;s! But I will not be re&s;pon&s;ible for your offending &s;uch a mother; &s;carcely can you honour her your&s;elf more than I do; and I here declare mo&s;t &s;olemnly&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O &s;top!"</Q> interrupted Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"and re&s;olve not till you have heard me. Would you, were &s;he no more, were my father al&s;o no more, would you yet per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;hould you a&s;k me?"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, blu&s;hing; <Q REND="inline">"you would then be your own agent, and perhaps&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She he&s;itated, and Delvile vehemently exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh make me not a mon&s;ter! force me not to de&s;ire the death of the very beings by whom I live! weaken not the bonds of affection by which they are en|deared to me, and compel me not to wi&s;h them no more as the &s;ole barriers to my happine&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"could I believe you &s;o impious, I &s;hould &s;uffer little indeed in de&s;iring your eternal ab&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76">
<Q REND="inline">"Why then only upon their extinction mu&s;t I re&s;t my hope of your favour?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;taggered and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this que&s;tion, could make no an&s;wer. Delvile, perceiving her embarra&s;&s;ment, redoubled his urgency; and before &s;he had power to recollect her&s;elf, &s;he had almo&s;t con&s;ented to his plan, when Henrietta Belfield ru&s;h|ing into her memory, &s;he ha&s;tily exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"One doubt there is, which I know not how to mention, but ought to have cleared up;&mdash;you are acquainted with&mdash;you re|member Mi&s;s Belfield?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly; but what of Mi&s;s Belfield that can rai&s;e a doubt in the mind of Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia coloured, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"you could ever for an in&s;tant &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;but I cannot even name a &s;uppo&s;ition &s;o foreign to all po&s;&s;ibility."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is &s;urely very amiable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is innocent, gentle, and engaging; and I heartily wi&s;h &s;he were in a better &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you ever occa&s;ionally, or by any accident, corre&s;pond with her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never in my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And were not your vi&s;its to the bro|ther <HI>&s;ometimes</HI>&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have a care,"</Q> interrupted he, laughing,
<PB N="78" REF="77">
<Q REND="inline">"le&s;t I rever&s;e the que&s;tion, and a&s;k if your vi&s;its to the &s;i&s;ter were not <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> for the brother! But what does this mean? Could Mi&s;s Beverley imagine that <HI>after</HI> knowing her, the charms of Mi&s;s Belfield could put me in any danger?</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, bound in delicacy and friend&s;hip not to betray the tender and tru&s;ting Hen|rietta, and internally &s;atisfied of his inno|cence by his frankne&s;s, evaded any an&s;wer, and would now have done with the &s;ubject; but Delvile, eager wholly to exculpate him|&s;elf, though by no means di&s;plea&s;ed at an enquiry which &s;hewed &s;o much intere&s;t in his affections, continued his explanation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Belfield has, I grant, an attrac|tion in the &s;implicity of her manners which charms by its &s;ingularity: her heart, too, &s;eems all purity, and her temper all &s;oftne&s;s. I have not, you find, been blind to her merit; on the contrary, I have both ad|mired and pitied her. But far indeed is &s;he removed from all chance of rivalry in my heart! A character &s;uch as hers for a while is irre&s;i&s;tably alluring; but when its novelty is over, &s;implicity uninformed be|comes weari&s;ome, and &s;oftne&s;s without dig|nity is too indi&s;criminate to give delight. We &s;igh for entertainment, when cloyed by mere &s;weetne&s;s; and heavily drags on the load of life when the companion of our
<PB N="79" REF="78">
&s;ocial hours wants &s;pirit, intelligence, and cultivation. With Mi&s;s Beverley all the&s;e&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Talk not of all the&s;e,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"when one &s;ingle ob&s;tacle has power to render them valuele&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But now,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"that ob&s;tacle is &s;urmounted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surmounted only for a moment! for even in your letter this morning you con|fe&s;s the regret with which it fills you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why &s;hould I deceive you? Why pretend to think with plea&s;ure, or even with indifference, of an ob&s;tacle which has had thus long the power to make me mi|&s;erable? But where is happine&s;s without allay? Is perfect bli&s;s the condition of hu|manity? Oh if we refu&s;e to ta&s;te it till in its la&s;t &s;tate of refinement, how &s;hall the cup of evil be ever from our lips?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How indeed!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with a &s;igh; <Q REND="inline">"the regret, I believe, will remain eternally upon your mind, and &s;he, per|haps, who &s;hould cau&s;e, might &s;oon be taught to partake of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Beverley! how have I merited this &s;everity? Did I make my propo&s;als lightly? Did I &s;uffer my eagerne&s;s to conquer my rea&s;on? Have I not, on the contrary, been &s;teady and con|&s;iderate?
<PB N="80" REF="79">
neither bia&s;&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ion nor betrayed by tenderne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And yet in what,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"con|&s;i&s;ts this boa&s;ted &s;teadine&s;s? I perceived it indeed, at Delvile-Ca&s;tle, but here&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The pride of heart which &s;upported me there,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"will &s;upport me no longer; what &s;u&s;tained my firmne&s;s, but your apparent &s;everity? What enabled me to fly you, but your invariable coldne&s;s? The rigour with which I trampled upon my feelings I thought fortitude and &s;pirit,&mdash;but I knew not then the pitying &s;ympathy of Cecilia!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that you knew it not yet!"</Q> cried &s;he, blu&s;hing; <Q REND="inline">"before that fatal accident you thought of me, I believe, in a manner far more honourable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible! differently, I thought of you, but never better, never &s;o well as now. I then repre&s;ented you all lovely in beauty, all perfect in goodne&s;s and virtue; but it was virtue in its highe&s;t maje&s;ty, not, as now, blended with the &s;ofte&s;t &s;en&s;ibility."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how the por|trait is faded!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, it is but more from the life: it is the &s;ublimity of an angel, mingled with all that is attractive in woman. But who is the friend we may venture to tru&s;t? To whom may I give my bond? And from
<PB N="81" REF="80">
whom may I receive a trea&s;ure which for the re&s;t of my life will con&s;titute all its felicity?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where can <HI>I,</HI>"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"find a friend, who, in this critical moment will in|&s;truct me how to act!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will find one,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"in your own bo&s;om: a&s;k but your&s;elf this plain que&s;tion; will any virtue be offended by your honouring me with your hand?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes; duty will be offended, &s;ince it is contrary to the will of your parents."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But is there no time for emancipation? Am not I of an age to chu&s;e for my&s;elf the partner of my life? Will not you in a few days be the uncontrolled mi&s;tre&s;s of your actions? Are we not both independant? Your ample fortune all your own, and the e&s;tates of my father &s;o entailed they mu&s;t unavoidably be mine?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are the&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"con|&s;iderations to &s;et us free from our duty?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, but they are circum&s;tances to re|lieve us from &s;lavery. Let me not offend you if I am &s;till more explicit. When no law, human or divine, can be injured by our union, when one motive of pride is all that can be oppo&s;ed to a thou&s;and motives of convenience and happine&s;s, why &s;hould we <HI>both</HI> be made unhappy, merely le&s;t that pride &s;hould lo&s;e its gratification?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81">
This que&s;tion, which &s;o often and &s;o angrily &s;he had revolved in her own mind, again &s;ilenced her; and Delvile, with the eagerne&s;s of approaching &s;ucce&s;s, redoubled his &s;olicitations.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be mine,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;weete&s;t Cecilia, and all will go well. To refer me to my friends is, effectually, to bani&s;h me for-ever. Spare me, then, the unavailing ta&s;k; and &s;ave me from the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s entreaties of a mother, who&s;e every de&s;ire I have held &s;acred, who&s;e wi&s;h has been my law, and who&s;e com|mands I have implicitly, invariably obeyed! Oh generou&s;ly &s;ave me from the dreadful alternative of wounding her maternal heart by a preremptory refu&s;al, or of torturing my own with pangs to which it is unequal by an extorted obedience!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how utterly impo&s;&s;ible I can relieve you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why? once mine, irrevocably mine&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, that would but irritate,&mdash;and irri|tate pa&s;t hope of pardon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed you are mi&s;taken: to your merit they are far from in&s;en&s;ible, and your for|tune is ju&s;t what they wi&s;h. Tru&s;t me, therefore, when I a&s;&s;ure you that their di&s;|plea&s;ure, which both re&s;pect and ju&s;tice will guard them from ever &s;hewing <HI>you,</HI> will &s;oon die wholly away. I &s;peak not merely
<PB N="83" REF="82">
from my hopes; in judging my own friends, I con&s;ider human nature in general. In|evitable evils are ever be&s;t &s;upported. It is &s;u&s;pence, it is hope that make the food of mi&s;ery; certainty is always endured, be|cau&s;e known to be pa&s;t amendment, and felt to give defiance to &s;truggling."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"with rea&s;oning &s;o de&s;perate be &s;atisfied?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In a &s;ituation &s;o extraordinary as ours,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"there is no other. The voice of the world at large will be all in our favour. Our union neither injures our fortunes, nor taints our morality: with the character of each the other is &s;atisfied, and both mu&s;t be alike exculpated from mercenary views of intere&s;t, or romantic contempt of poverty; what right have we, then, to repine at an objection which, how|ever potent, is &s;ingle? Surely none. Oh if wholly unchecked were the happine&s;s I now have in view, if no foul &s;torm &s;ometimes lowered over the pro&s;pect, and for a mo|ment ob&s;cured its brightne&s;s, how could my heart find room for joy &s;o &s;uperlative? The whole world might ri&s;e again&s;t me as the fir&s;t man in it who had nothing left to wi&s;h!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e own hopes aided this rea|&s;oning, found not much to oppo&s;e to it; and with little more of entreaty, and &s;till le&s;s of
<PB N="84" REF="83">
argument, Delvile at length obtained her con&s;ent to his plan. Fearfully, indeed, and with unfeigned reluctance &s;he gave it, but it was the only alternative with a &s;eparation for-ever, to which &s;he held not the nece&s;&s;ity adequate to the pain.</P>
<P>The thanks of Delvile were as vehement as had been his entreaties, which yet, how|ever, were not at an end; the conce&s;&s;ion &s;he had made was imperfect, unle&s;s its perform|ance were immediate, and he now endea|voured to prevail with her to be his before the expiration of a week.</P>
<P>Here, however, his ta&s;k cea&s;ed to be difficult; Cecilia, as ingenuous by nature as &s;he was honourable from principle, hav|ing once brought her mind to con&s;ent to his propo&s;al, &s;ought not by &s;tudied difficulties to enhance the value of her compliance: the great point re&s;olved upon, &s;he held all el&s;e of too little importance for a conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton was now called in, and acquainted with the re&s;ult of their confer|ence. Her approbation by no means fol|lowed the &s;cheme of privacy; yet &s;he was too much rejoiced in &s;eeing her young friend near the period of her long &s;u&s;pence and unea&s;ine&s;s, to oppo&s;e any plan which might forward their termination.</P>
<P>Delvile then again begged to know what
<PB N="85" REF="84">
male confident might be entru&s;ted with their project.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton immediately occurred to Cecilia, though the certainty of his ill-will to the cau&s;e made all application to him di&s;agreeable: but his long and &s;teady friend&s;hip for her, his readine&s;s to coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and the promi&s;es &s;he had oc|ca&s;ionally made, not to act without his ad|vice, all concurred to per&s;uade her that in a matter of &s;uch importance, &s;he owed to him her confidence, and &s;hould be culpable to proceed without it. Upon him, there|fore, &s;he fixed; yet finding in her&s;elf a re|pugnance in&s;uperable to acquainting him with her &s;ituation, &s;he agreed that Delvile, who in&s;tantly propo&s;ed to be her me&s;|&s;enger, &s;hould open to him the affair, and prepare him for their meeting.</P>
<P>Delvile then, rapid in thought and fer|tile in expedients, with a celerity and vi|gour which bore down all objections, ar|ranged the whole conduct of the bu&s;ine&s;s. To avoid &s;u&s;picion, he determined in|&s;tantly to quit her, and, as &s;oon as he had executed his commi&s;&s;ion with Mr. Monck|ton, to ha&s;ten to London, that the nece&s;|&s;ary preparations for their marriage might be made with di&s;patch and &s;ecre&s;y. He purpo&s;ed, al&s;o, to find out Mr. Belfield, that he might draw up the bond with which
<PB N="86" REF="85">
he meant to entru&s;t Mr. Monckton. This mea&s;ure Cecilia would have oppo&s;ed, but he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to her. Mrs. Charlton her&s;elf, though her age and infirmities had long confined her to her own hou&s;e, grati|fied Cecilia upon this critical occa&s;ion with con&s;enting to accompany her to the altar. Mr. Monckton was depended upon for giving her away, and a church in London was the place appointed for the performance of the ceremony. In three days the prin|cipal difficulties to the union would be re|moved by Cecilia's coming of age, and in five days it was agreed they &s;hould actu|ally meet in town. The moment they were married Delvile promi&s;ed to &s;et off for the Ca&s;tle, while in another chai&s;e, Cecilia re|turned to Mrs. Charlton's.</P>
<P>This &s;ettled, he conjured her to be punc|tual, and earne&s;tly recommending him&s;elf to her fidelity and affection, he bid her adieu.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A RETROSPECTION.</HEAD>
<P>LEFT now to her&s;elf, &s;en&s;ations unfelt before filled the heart of Cecilia. All that had pa&s;&s;ed for a while appeared a dream; her ideas were indi&s;tinct, her me|mory was confu&s;ed, her faculties &s;eemed all out of order, and &s;he had but an imperfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s either of the tran&s;action in which &s;he had ju&s;t been engaged, or of the promi&s;e &s;he had bound her&s;elf to fulfil: even truth from imagination &s;he &s;carcely could &s;eparate; all was darkne&s;s and doubt, inquietude and di&s;order!</P>
<P>But when at length her recollection more clearly returned, and her &s;ituation appeared to her &s;uch as it really was, dive&s;ted alike of fal&s;e terrors or delu&s;ive expectations, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;till further removed from tranquility.</P>
<P>Hitherto, though no &s;tranger to &s;orrow, which the &s;ickne&s;s and early lo&s;s of her friends had fir&s;t taught her to feel, and which the &s;ub&s;equent anxiety of her own heart had &s;ince in&s;tructed her to bear, &s;he had yet invariably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the con&s;olation

of &s;elf-approving reflections: but the &s;tep &s;he was now about to take, all her prin|ciples oppo&s;ed; it terrified her as undu|tiful, it &s;hocked her as clande&s;tine, and &s;carce was Delvile out of &s;ight, before &s;he regretted her con&s;ent to it as the lo&s;s of her &s;elf-e&s;teem, and believed, even if a reconciliation took place, the remembrance of a wilful fault would &s;till follow her, blemi&s;h in her own eyes the character &s;he had hoped to &s;upport, and be a con&s;tant allay to her happine&s;s, by telling her how unworthily &s;he had obtained it.</P>
<P>Where frailty has never been voluntary, nor error &s;tubborn, where the pride of early integrity is un&s;ubdued, and the fir&s;t purity of innocence is inviolate, how fearfully delicate, how <Q REND="inline">"tremblingly alive,"</Q> is the con&s;cience of man! &s;trange, that what in its fir&s;t &s;tate is &s;o tender, can in its la&s;t become &s;o callous!</P>
<P>Compared with the general lot of human mi&s;ery, Cecilia had &s;uffered nothing; but compared with the exaltation of ideal hap|pine&s;s, &s;he had &s;uffered much; willingly, however, would &s;he again have borne all that had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, experienced the &s;ame painful &s;u&s;pence, endured the &s;ame melancholy parting, and gone through the &s;ame cruel ta&s;k of combating inclination with rea&s;on, to have relieved her virtuous
<PB N="89" REF="88">
mind from the new-born and intolerable terror of con&s;cientious reproaches.</P>
<P>The equity of her notions permitted her not from the earne&s;tne&s;s of Delvile's en|treaties to draw any palliation for her con|&s;ent to his propo&s;al; &s;he was con&s;cious that but for her own too great facility tho&s;e en|treaties would have been ineffectual, &s;ince &s;he well knew how little from any other of her admirers they would have availed.</P>
<P>But chiefly her affliction and repentance hung upon Mrs. Delvile, whom &s;he loved, reverenced and honoured, whom &s;he dread|ed to offend, and whom &s;he well knew ex|pected from her even exemplary virtue. Her prai&s;es, her partiality, her confidence in her character, which hitherto had been her pride, &s;he now only recollected with &s;hame and with &s;adne&s;s. The terror of the fir&s;t interview never cea&s;ed to be pre&s;ent to her; &s;he &s;hrunk even in imagination from her wrath-darting eye, &s;he felt &s;tung by pointed &s;atire, and &s;ubdued by cold con|tempt.</P>
<P>Yet to di&s;appoint Delvile &s;o late, by for|feiting a promi&s;e &s;o po&s;itively accorded; to trifle with a man who to her had been uni|formly candid, to waver when her word was engaged, and retract when he thought him|&s;elf &s;ecure,&mdash;honour, ju&s;tice and &s;hame told her the time was now pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="89">
<Q REND="inline">"And yet is not this,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"placing nominal before actual evil? Is it not &s;tudying appearance at the expence of reality? If agreeing to wrong is cri|minal, is not performing it wor&s;e? If re|pentance for ill actions calls for mercy, has not repentance for ill intentions a yet higher claim?&mdash;And what reproaches from Del|vile can be &s;o bitter as my own? What &s;eparation, what &s;orrow, what po&s;&s;ible cala|mity can hang upon my mind with &s;uch heavine&s;s, as the &s;en&s;e of committing vo|luntary evil?"</Q></P>
<P>This thought &s;o much affected her, that, conquering all regret either for Delvile or her&s;elf, &s;he re&s;olved to write to him in|&s;tantly, and acquaint him of the alteration in her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>This, however, after having &s;o deeply engaged her&s;elf, was by no means ea&s;y; and many letters were begun, but not one of them was fini&s;hed, when a &s;udden recol|lection obliged her to give over the at|tempt,&mdash;for &s;he knew not whither to direct to him.</P>
<P>In the ha&s;te with which their plan had been formed and &s;ettled, it had never once occurred to them that any occa&s;ion for writing was likely to happen. Delvile, indeed, knew that her addre&s;s would &s;till be the &s;ame; and with regard to his own,
<PB N="91" REF="90">
as his journey to London was to be &s;ecret, he purpo&s;ed not having any fixed habi|tation. On the day of their marriage, and not before, they had appointed to meet at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Roberts, in Fetter-Lane, whence they were in&s;tantly to proceed to the church.</P>
<P>She might &s;till, indeed, enclo&s;e a letter for him in one to Mrs. Hill, to be delivered to him on the de&s;tined morning when he called to claim her; but to fail him at the la&s;t moment, when Mr. Belfield would have drawn up the bond, when a licence was procured, the clergyman waiting to per|form the ceremony, and Delvile without a &s;u&s;picion but that the next moment would unite them for ever, &s;eemed extending pru|dence into treachery, and power into ty|ranny. Delvile had done nothing to merit &s;uch treatment, he had practi&s;ed no deceit, he had been guilty of no perfidy, he had opened to her his whole heart, and after &s;hewing it without any di&s;gui&s;e, the option had been all her own to accept or refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>A ray of joy now broke its way through the gloom of her apprehen&s;ions. <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I have not, then, any means to recede! an unprovoked breach of pro|mi&s;e at the very moment de&s;tined for its performance, would but vary the mode of
<PB N="92" REF="91">
acting wrong, without approaching nearer to acting right!"</Q></P>
<P>This idea for a while not merely calmed but delighted her; to be the wife of Del|vile &s;eemed now a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;he &s;oothed her&s;elf with believing that to &s;truggle again&s;t it were vain.</P>
<P>The next morning during breakfa&s;t Mr. Monckton arrived.</P>
<P>Not greater, though winged with joy, had been the expedition of Delvile to open to him his plan, than was his own, though only goaded by de&s;peration, to make &s;ome effort with Cecilia for rendering it abortive. Nor could all his &s;elf-denial, the command which he held over his pa&s;&s;ions, nor the rigour with which his feelings were made &s;ub&s;ervient to his intere&s;t, in this &s;udden hour of trial, avail to pre&s;erve his equa|nimity. The refinements of hypocri&s;y, and the arts of in&s;inuation, offered advan|tages too di&s;tant, and exacted attentions too &s;ubtle, for a moment &s;o alarming; tho&s;e arts and tho&s;e attentions he had al|ready for many years practi&s;ed, with an addre&s;s the mo&s;t ma&s;terly, and a diligence the mo&s;t indefatigable: &s;ucce&s;s had of late &s;eemed to follow his toils; the encrea&s;ing infirmities of his wife, the di&s;appointment and retirement of Cecilia, uniting to pro|mi&s;e him a conclu&s;ion equally &s;peedy and
<PB N="93" REF="92">
happy; when now, by a &s;udden and unex|pected &s;troke, the &s;weet &s;olace of his future cares, the long-projected recompence of his pa&s;t &s;ufferings, was to be &s;natched from him for-ever, and by one who, compared with him&s;elf, was but the acquaintance of a day.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t wholly off his guard from the &s;urpri&s;e and horror of this apprehen&s;ion, he entered the room with &s;uch an air of ha&s;te and perturbation, that Mrs. Charlton and her grand-daughters demanded what was the matter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am come,"</Q> he an&s;wered abruptly, yet endeavouring to recollect him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;peak with Mi&s;s Beverley upon bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome importance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton, <Q REND="inline">"you had better go with Mr. Monckton into your dre&s;&s;ing-room."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, deeply blu&s;hing, aro&s;e and led the way: &s;lowly, however, &s;he proceeded, though urged by Mr. Monckton to make &s;peed. Certain of his di&s;approbation, and but doubtfully relieved from her own, &s;he dreaded a conference which on his &s;ide, &s;he fore&s;aw, would be all exhortation and reproof, and on hers all timidity and &s;hame.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Be|verley, what is this you have done? bound
<PB N="94" REF="93">
your&s;elf to marry a man who de&s;pi&s;es, who &s;corns, who refu&s;es to own you!"</Q></P>
<P>Shocked by this opening, &s;he &s;tarted, but could make no an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"See you not,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"the indignity which is offered you? Does the loo&s;e, the flim&s;y veil with which it is co|vered, hide it from your under&s;tanding, or di&s;gui&s;e it from your delicacy?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought not,&mdash;I meant not,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, more and more confounded, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ub|mit to any indignity, though my pride, in an exigence &s;o peculiar, may give way, for a while, to convenience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To convenience?"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"to contempt, to deri&s;ion, to in&s;olence!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Mr. Monckton!"</Q> interrupted Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"make not u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions! they are too cruel for me to hear, and if I thought they were ju&s;t, would make me mi&s;erable for life!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are deceived, gro&s;sly deceived,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline">"if you doubt their truth for a moment: they are not, indeed, even de|cently concealed from you; they are glaring as the day, and wilful blindne&s;s can alone ob&s;cure them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who&s;e confu&s;ion, at a charge &s;o rough, began now to give way to anger, <Q REND="inline">"if this is your opi|nion; and I am &s;orry, too, for the liberty I
<PB N="95" REF="94">
have taken in troubling you upon &s;uch a &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P>An apology &s;o full of di&s;plea&s;ure in|&s;tantly taught Mr. Monckton the error he was committing, and checking, therefore, the violence of tho&s;e emotions to which his &s;udden and de&s;perate di&s;appointment gave ri&s;e, and which betrayed him into re|proaches &s;o un&s;kilful, he endeavoured to recover his accu&s;tomed equanimity, and a&s;&s;uming an air of friendly openne&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Let me not offend you, my dear Mi&s;s Beverley, by a freedom which re&s;ults merely from a &s;olicitude to &s;erve you, and which the length and intimacy of our acquaintance had, I hoped, long &s;ince authori&s;ed. I know not how to &s;ee you on the brink of de&s;truction without &s;peaking, yet, if you are aver&s;e to my &s;incerity, I will curb it, and have done."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, do not have done,"</Q> cried &s;he, much &s;oftened; <Q REND="inline">"your &s;incerity does me nothing but honour, and hitherto, I am &s;ure, it has done me nothing but good. Perhaps I de&s;erve your utmo&s;t cen&s;ure; I feared it, indeed, before you came, and ought, therefore, to have better prepared my&s;elf for meeting with it."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech completed Mr. Monckton's &s;elf-victory; it &s;hewed him not only the impropriety of his turbulence, but gave him
<PB N="96" REF="95">
room to hope that a mildne&s;s more crafty would have better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You cannot but be certain,"</Q> he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"that my zeal proceeds wholly from a de&s;ire to be of u&s;e to you: my knowledge of the world might po&s;&s;ibly, I thought, a&s;&s;i&s;t your inexperience, and the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my regard, might ena|ble me to &s;ee and to point out the dangers to which you are expo&s;ed, from artifice and duplicity in tho&s;e who have other purpo&s;es to an&s;wer than what &s;imply belong to your welfare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither artifice nor duplicity,"</Q> cried Cecilia, jealous for the honour of Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"have been practi&s;ed again&s;t me. Argu|ment, and not per&s;ua&s;ion, determined me, and if I have done wrong&mdash;tho&s;e who prompted me have erred as unwittingly as my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are too generous to perceive the difference, or you would find nothing le&s;s alike. If, however, my plainne&s;s will not offend you, before it is quite too late, I will point out to you a few of the evils,&mdash;for there are &s;ome I cannot even mention, which at this in&s;tant do not merely threaten, but await you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;tarted at this terrifying offer, and afraid to accept, yet a&s;hamed to refu&s;e it, hung back irre&s;olute.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="96">
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome continuance, <Q REND="inline">"your deter|mination admits no appeal. The con&s;e|quence mu&s;t, indeed, be all your own, but I am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of its &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Hereafter you will wi&s;h, perhaps, that the friend of your earlie&s;t youth had been permitted to advi&s;e you; at pre&s;ent you only think him offi|cious and impertinent, and therefore he can do nothing you will be &s;o likely to approve as quitting you. I wi&s;h you, then, greater happine&s;s than &s;eems prepared to follow you, and a coun&s;ellor more pro&s;|perous in offering his a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</Q></P>
<P>He would then have taken his leave: but Cecilia called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Mr. Monckton! do you then give me up?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not unle&s;s you wi&s;h it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, I know not what to wi&s;h! ex|cept, indeed, the re&s;toration of that &s;ecu|rity from &s;elf-blame, which till ye&s;terday, even in the mid&s;t of di&s;appointment, quieted and con&s;oled me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you, then, &s;en&s;ible you have gone wrong, yet re&s;olute not to turn back?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Could I tell, could I &s;ee,"</Q> cried &s;he, with energy, <Q REND="inline">"which way I <HI>ought</HI> to turn, not a moment would I he&s;itate how to act! my heart &s;hould have no power, my hap|pine&s;s no choice,&mdash;I would recover my
<PB N="98" REF="97">
own e&s;teem by any &s;acrifice that could be made!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, can po&s;&s;ibly be your doubt? To be as you were ye&s;terday what is wanting but your own inclination?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Every thing is wanting; right, honour, firmne&s;s, all by which the ju&s;t are bound, and all which the con&s;cientious hold &s;a|cred!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e &s;cruples are merely romantic; your own good &s;en&s;e, had it fairer play, would contemn them; but it is warped at pre&s;ent by prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed!"</Q> cried &s;he, colouring at the charge, <Q REND="inline">"I may have entered too precipitately into an engagement I ought to have avoided, but it is weakne&s;s of judg|ment, not of heart, that di&s;ables me from retrieving my error."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you, nor which way you may e&s;cape from it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, trembling, <Q REND="inline">"I am now ready to hear both."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Briefly, then, I will tell you. It will lead you into a family of which every indi|vidual will di&s;dain you; it will make you inmate of an hou&s;e of which no other in|mate will a&s;&s;ociate with you; you will be in&s;ulted as an inferior, and reproached as an intruder; your birth will be a &s;ubject of

ridicule, and your whole race only named with deri&s;ion: and while the elders of the proud ca&s;tle treat you with open contempt, the man for whom you &s;uffer will not dare to &s;upport you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible! impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, with the mo&s;t angry emotion; <Q REND="inline">"this whole repre&s;entation is exaggerated, and the latter part is utterly without foun|dation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The latter part,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"is of all other lea&s;t di&s;putable: the man who now dares not own, will then never venture to defend you. On the contrary, to make peace for him&s;elf, he will be the fir&s;t to neglect you. The ruined e&s;tates of his ance&s;tors will be repaired by your for|tune, while the name which you carry into his family will be con&s;tantly re&s;ented as an injury: you will thus be plundered though you are &s;corned, and told to con&s;ider your|&s;elf honoured that they conde&s;cend to make u&s;e of you! nor here re&s;ts the evil of a forced connection with &s;o much arrogance,&mdash;even your children, &s;hould you have any, will be educated to de&s;pi&s;e you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dreadful and horrible!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can hear no more,&mdash;Oh, Mr. Monckton, what a pro&s;pect have you opened to my view!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fly from it, then, while it is yet in

your power,&mdash;when two paths are before you, chu&s;e not that which leads to de|&s;truction; &s;end in&s;tantly after Delvile, and tell him you have recovered your &s;en&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would long &s;ince have &s;ent,&mdash;I wanted not a repre&s;entation &s;uch as this,&mdash;but I know not how to direct to him, nor whither he is gone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All art and ba&s;ene&s;s to prevent your recantation!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</Q> cried &s;he, with quickne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"whatever may be the truth of your painting in general, all that con|cerns&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>A&s;hamed of the vindication &s;he intended, which yet in her own mind was firm and animated, &s;he &s;topt, and left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In what place were you to meet?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton; <Q REND="inline">"you can at lea&s;t &s;end to him there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We were only to have met,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, in much confu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"at the la&s;t mo|ment,&mdash;and that would be too late&mdash;it would be too&mdash;I could not, without &s;ome previous notice, break a promi&s;e which I gave without any re&s;triction."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is this your only objection?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is: but it is one which I cannot conquer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you would give up this ill|boding

connection, but from notions of delicacy with regard to the time?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I meant it, before you came."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I,</HI> then, will obviate this objection: give me but the commi&s;&s;ion, either verbally or in writing, and I will undertake to find him out, and deliver it before night."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, little expecting this offer, turned extremely pale, and after pau&s;ing &s;ome mo|ments, &s;aid in a faultering voice, <Q REND="inline">"What, then, Sir, is your advice, in what man|ner&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will &s;ay to him all that is nece&s;&s;ary; tru&s;t the matter with me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;he de&s;erves, at lea&s;t, an apology from my&s;elf,&mdash;though how to make it&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;topt, &s;he he&s;itated, &s;he went out of the room for pen and ink, &s;he returned without them, and the agitation of her mind every in&s;tant encrea&s;ing, &s;he begged him, in a faint voice, to excu&s;e her while &s;he con&s;ulted with Mrs. Charlton, and pro|mi&s;ing to wait upon him again, was hurry|ing away.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, however, &s;aw too great danger in &s;o much emotion to tru&s;t her out of his &s;ight: he told her, therefore, that &s;he would only encrea&s;e her perplexity, without reaping any advantage, by an ap|plication to Mrs. Charlton, and that if &s;he was really &s;incere in wi&s;hing to recede,
<PB N="102" REF="101">
there was not a moment to be lo&s;t, and Delvile &s;hould immediately be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;en&s;ible of the truth of this &s;peech, and once more recollecting the unaffected earne&s;tne&s;s with which but an hour or two before, &s;he had her&s;elf de&s;ired to renounce this engagement, now &s;um|moned her utmo&s;t courage to her aid, and, after a &s;hort, but painful &s;truggle, deter|mined to act con&s;i&s;tently with her profe&s;&s;ions and her character, and, by one great and final effort, to conclude all her doubts, and try to &s;ilence even her regret, by completing the triumph of fortitude over inclination.</P>
<P>She called, therefore, for pen and ink, and without venturing her&s;elf from the room, wrote the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MORTIMER DELVILE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>Accu&s;e me not of caprice, and pardon my irre&s;olution, when you find me &s;hrink|ing with terror from the promi&s;e I have made, and no longer either able or willing to perform it. The reproaches of your family I &s;hould very ill endure; but the reproaches of my own heart for an action I can neither approve nor defend, would be &s;till more oppre&s;&s;ive. With &s;uch a weight upon the mind length of life would be bur|then&s;ome; with a &s;en&s;ation of guilt early
<PB N="103" REF="102">
death would be terrific! The&s;e being my notions of the engagement into which we have entered, you cannot wonder, and you have &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to repine, that I dare not fulfil it. Alas! where would be your chance of happine&s;s with one who in the very act of becoming yours would forfeit her own!</P>
<P>I blu&s;h at this tardy recantation, and I grieve at the di&s;appointment it may occa|&s;ion you: but I have yielded to the ex|hortations of an inward monitor, who is never to be neglected with impunity. Con|&s;ult him your&s;elf; and I &s;hall need no other advocate.</P>
<P>Adieu, and may all felicity attend you! if to hear of the almo&s;t total privation of mine, will mitigate the re&s;entment with which you will probably read this letter, it may be mitigated but too ea&s;ily! Yet my con&s;ent to a clande&s;tine action &s;hall never be repeated; and though I confe&s;s to you I am not happy, I &s;olemnly declare my re&s;olution is unalterable. A little reflection will tell you I am right, though a great deal of lenity may &s;carce &s;uffice to make you pardon my being right no &s;ooner.</P>

<P>Cecilia returned to Mrs. Charlton to acquaint her with what had pa&s;&s;ed: and notwith&s;tanding the &s;orrow &s;he felt in appa|rently injuring the man whom, in the whole world &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to oblige, &s;he yet found a &s;atisfaction in the &s;acrifice &s;he had made, that recompen&s;ed her for much of her &s;ufferings, and &s;oothed her into &s;ome|thing like tranquility; the true power of virtue &s;he had &s;carce experienced before, for &s;he found it a re&s;ource again&s;t the cru|elle&s;t dejection, and a &s;upporter in the bit|tere&s;t di&s;appointment.</P>

<P>THE day pa&s;&s;ed on without any intelli|gence; the next day, al&s;o, pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, and on the third, which was her birth-day, Cecilia became of age.</P>
<P>The preparations which had long been making among her tenants to celebrate this event, Cecilia appeared to take &s;ome &s;hare, and endeavoured to find &s;ome plea&s;ure in. She gave a public dinner to all who were willing to partake of it, &s;he promi&s;ed re|dre&s;s to tho&s;e who complained of hard u&s;age, &s;he pardoned many debts, and di&s;tributed money, food, and cloathing to the poor. The&s;e benevolent occupations made time &s;eem le&s;s heavy, and while they freed her from &s;olitude, diverted her &s;u&s;pen&s;e. She &s;till, however, continued at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Charlton, the workmen having di&s;ap|pointed her in fini&s;hing her own.</P>
<P>But, in defiance of her utmo&s;t exertion, towards the evening of this day the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of her uncertainty grew almo&s;t intol|erable. The next morning &s;he had promi&s;ed
<PB N="106" REF="105">
Delvile to &s;et out for London, and he expected the morning after to claim her for his wife; yet Mr. Monckton neither &s;ent nor came, and &s;he knew not if her letter was delivered, or if &s;till he was unprepared for the di&s;appointment by which he was awaited. A &s;ecret regret for the unhappi|ne&s;s &s;he mu&s;t occa&s;ion him, which &s;ilently yet powerfully reproached her, &s;tole fa&s;t upon her mind, and poi&s;oned its tranqui|lity; for though her opinion was invariable in holding his propo&s;al to be wrong, &s;he thought too highly of his character to be|lieve he would have made it but from a mi&s;taken notion it was right. She painted him, therefore, to her&s;elf, as glowing with indignation, accu&s;ing her of incon&s;i&s;tency, and perhaps &s;u&s;pecting her of coquetry, and imputing her change of conduct to motives the mo&s;t trifling and narrow, till with re|&s;entment and di&s;dain, he drove her wholly from his thoughts.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, however, the picture was rever&s;ed; Delvile no more appeared &s;torming nor unrea&s;onable; his face wore an a&s;pect of &s;orrow, and his brow was clouded with di&s;appointment: he forebore to reproach her, but the look which her imagination delineated was more piercing than words of &s;evere&s;t import.</P>
<P>The&s;e images pu&s;ued and tormented
<PB N="107" REF="106">
her, drew tears from her eyes, and loaded her heart with angui&s;h. Yet, when &s;he re|collected that her conduct had had in view an higher motive than plea&s;ing Delvile, &s;he felt that it ought to offer her an higher &s;atis|faction: &s;he tried, therefore, to revive her &s;pirits, by reflecting upon her integrity, and refu&s;ed all indulgence to this enervating &s;adne&s;s, beyond what the weakne&s;s of hu|man nature demands, as &s;ome relief to its &s;ufferings upon every fre&s;h attack of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A conduct &s;uch as this was the be&s;t anti|dote again&s;t affliction, who&s;e arrows are never with &s;o little difficulty repelled, as when they light upon a con&s;cience which no &s;elf-reproach has laid bare to their ma|lignancy.</P>
<P>Before &s;ix o'clock the next morning, her maid came to her bed&s;ide with the following letter, which &s;he told her had been brought by an expre&s;s.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>May this letter, with one only from Del|vile-Ca&s;tle, be the la&s;t that <HI>Mi&s;s Beverley</HI> may ever receive!</P>
<P>Yet &s;weet to me as is that hope, I write in the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; I have ju&s;t heard that a gentleman, whom, by the de&s;cription
<PB N="108" REF="107">
that is given of him, I imagine is Mr. Monckton, has been in &s;earch of me with a letter which he was anxious to deliver immediately.</P>
<P>Perhaps this letter is from Mi&s;s Bever|ley, perhaps it contains directions which ought in&s;tantly to be followed: could I divine what they are, with what eagerne&s;s would I &s;tudy to anticipate their execution! It will not, I hope, be too late to receive them on Saturday, when her power over my actions will be confirmed, and when every wi&s;h &s;he will communicate, &s;hall be gratefully, joyfully, and with delight ful|filled.</P>
<P>I have &s;ought Belfield in vain; he has left Lord Vannelt, and no one knows whither he is gone. I have been obliged, therefore, to tru&s;t a &s;tranger to draw up the bond; but he is a man of good character, and the time of &s;ecre&s;y will be too &s;hort to put his di&s;cretion in much danger. To|morrow, Friday, I &s;hall &s;pend &s;olely in endeavouring to di&s;cover Mr. Monckton; I have lei&s;ure &s;ufficient for the &s;earch, &s;ince &s;o pro&s;perous has been my diligence, that <HI>every thing is prepared!</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome lodgings in Pall-Mall, which I think are commodious and will &s;uit you: &s;end a &s;ervant, therefore, before you to &s;ecure them. If upon your arrival
<PB N="109" REF="108">
I &s;hould venture to meet you there, be not, I be&s;eech you, offended or alarmed; I &s;hall take every po&s;&s;ible precaution neither to be known nor &s;een, and I will &s;tay with you only three minutes. The me&s;&s;enger who carries this is ignorant from whom it comes, for I fear his repeating my name among your &s;ervants, and he could &s;carce return to me with an an&s;wer before you will your&s;elf be in town. Yes, lovelie&s;t Cecilia! at the very moment you receive this letter, the chai&s;e will, I flatter my&s;elf, be at the door, which is to bring to me a trea&s;ure that will enrich every future hour of my life! And oh as to me it will be exhau&s;tle&s;s, may but its &s;weet di&s;pen&s;er experience &s;ome &s;hare of the happine&s;s &s;he be&s;tows, and then what, &s;ave her own purity, will be &s;o perfect, &s;o un&s;ullied, as the felicity of her</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The perturbation of Cecilia upon read|ing this letter was un&s;peakable: Mr. Monckton, &s;he found, had been wholly un|&s;ucce&s;sful, all her heroi&s;m had an&s;wered no purpo&s;e, and the tran&s;action was as back|ward as before &s;he had exerted it.</P>
<P>She was now, therefore, called upon to think and act entirely for her&s;elf. Her opinion was &s;till the &s;ame, nor did her re|&s;olution
<PB N="110" REF="109">
waver, yet how to put it in execution &s;he could not di&s;cern.</P>
<P>To write to him was impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince &s;he was ignorant where he was to be found; to di&s;appoint him at the la&s;t moment &s;he could not re&s;olve, &s;ince &s;uch a conduct ap|peared to her unfeeling and unju&s;tifiable: for a few in&s;tants &s;he thought of having him waited for at night in London, with a letter; but the danger of entru&s;ting any one with &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion, and the uncertainty of finding him, &s;hould he di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf, made the &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;cheme too precarious for trial.</P>
<P>One expedient alone occurred to her, which, though &s;he felt to be hazardous, &s;he believed was without an alternative: this was no other than ha&s;tening to London her&s;elf, con&s;enting to the interview he had propo&s;ed in Pall-Mall, and then, by &s;trong|ly &s;tating her objections, and confe&s;&s;ing the grief they occa&s;ioned her, to pique at once his genero&s;ity and his pride upon re|lea&s;ing her him&s;elf from the engagement into which he had entered.</P>
<P>She had no time to deliberate; her plan, therefore, was decided almo&s;t as &s;oon as formed, and every moment being precious, &s;he was obliged to awaken Mrs. Charlton, and communicate to her at once the letter
<PB N="111" REF="110">
from Delvile, and the new re&s;olution &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, having no object in view but the happine&s;s of her young friend, with a facility that looked not for objections, and &s;carce &s;aw them when pre&s;ented, agreed to the expedition, and kindly con&s;ented to ac|company her to London; for Cecilia, however concerned to hurry and fatigue her, was too anxious for the &s;anction of her pre&s;ence to he&s;itate in &s;oliciting it.</P>
<P>A chai&s;e, therefore, was ordered; and with po&s;t-hor&s;es for &s;peed, and two &s;ervants on hor&s;eback, the moment Mrs. Charlton was ready, they &s;et out on their journey.</P>
<P>Scarce had they proceeded two miles on their way, when they were met by Mr. Monckton, who was ha&s;tening to their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Amazed and alarmed at a &s;ight &s;o unex|pected, he &s;topt the chai&s;e to enquire whither they was going.</P>
<P>Cecilia, without an&s;wering, a&s;ked if her letter had yet been received?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"deliver it to a man who was not to be found: I was this moment coming to ac|quaint how vainly I had &s;ought him; but &s;till that your journey is unnece&s;&s;ary unle&s;s voluntary, &s;ince I have left it at the hou&s;e where you told me you &s;hould meet to|morrow
<PB N="112" REF="111">
morning, and where he mu&s;t then unavoidably receive it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to|morrow morning will be too late,&mdash;in con|&s;cience, in ju&s;tice, and even in decency too late! I <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> therefore, go to town; yet I go not, believe me, in oppo&s;ition to your in|junctions, but to enable my&s;elf, without treachery or di&s;honour, to fulfil them."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, agha&s;t and confounded, made not any an&s;wer, till Cecilia gave orders to the po&s;tilion to drive on: he then ha&s;tily called to &s;top him, and began the warme&s;t expo&s;tulations; but Cecilia, firm when &s;he believed her&s;elf right, though wavering when fearful &s;he was wrong, told him it was now too late to change her plan, and repeating her orders to the po&s;tilion, left him to his own reflections: grieved her|&s;elf to reject his coun&s;el, yet too intently occupied by her own affairs and de&s;igns, to think long of any other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A TORMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AT &mdash; they &s;topt for dinner; Mrs. Charlton being too much fatigued to go on without &s;ome re&s;t, though the ha&s;te of Cecilia to meet Delvile time enough for new arranging their affairs, made her regret every moment that was &s;pent upon the road.</P>
<P>Their meal was not long, and they were returning to their chai&s;e, when they were &s;uddenly encountered by Mr. Morrice, who was ju&s;t alighted from his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>He congratulated him&s;elf upon the hap|pine&s;s of meeting them with the air of a man who nothing doubted that happine&s;s being mutual; then ha&s;tening to &s;peak of the Grove, <Q REND="inline">"I could hardly,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"get away; my friend Monckton won't know what to do without me, for Lady Margaret, poor old &s;oul, is in a &s;hocking bad way indeed; there's hardly any &s;taying in the room with her; her breathing is ju&s;t like the grunting of a hog. She can't po&s;|&s;ibly la&s;t long, for &s;he's quite upon her
<PB N="114" REF="113">
la&s;t legs, and trumbles about &s;o when &s;he walks alone, one would &s;wear &s;he was drunk."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you take infirmity,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton, who was now helped into the chai&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"for intoxication, you mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e no old per&s;on &s;ober."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Va&s;tly well &s;aid, ma'am,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"I really forgot your being an old lady your|&s;elf, or I &s;hould not have made the ob&s;er|vation. However, as to poor Lady Marga|ret, &s;he may do as well as ever by and bye, for &s;he has an excellent con&s;titution, and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has been hardly any better than &s;he is now the&s;e forty years, for I remember when I was quite a boy hearing her called a limping old puddle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, we'll di&s;cu&s;s this matter, if you plea&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome other time,"</Q> And ordered the po&s;tilion to drive on. But before they came to their next &s;tage, Mor|rice having changed his hor&s;e, joined them, and rode on by their &s;ide, begging them to ob&s;erve what ha&s;te he had made on purpo&s;e to have the plea&s;ure of e&s;corting them.</P>
<P>This forwardne&s;s was very offen&s;ive to Mrs. Charlton, who&s;e years and character had long procured her more deference and re&s;pect: but Cecilia, anxious only to ha&s;ten her journey, was indifferent to every thing, &s;ave what retarded it.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">
At the &s;ame Inn they both again changed hor&s;es, and he &s;till continued riding with them, and occa&s;ionally talking, till they were within twenty miles of London, when a di&s;turbance upon the road exciting his curio&s;ity, he ha&s;tily rode away from them to enquire into its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon coming up to the place whence it proceeded, they &s;aw a party of gentlemen on hor&s;eback &s;urrounding a chai&s;e which had been ju&s;t overturned; and while the confu&s;ion in the road obliged the po&s;tilion to &s;top, Cecilia heard a lady's voice ex|claiming, <Q REND="inline">"I declare I dare &s;ay I am kill|ed!"</Q> and in&s;tantly recollecting Mi&s;s La|rolles, the fear of di&s;covery and delay made her de&s;ire the man to drive on with all &s;peed. He was preparing to obey her, but Mor|rice, gallopping after them, called out <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, one of the ladies that has been overturned, is an acquaintance of yours. I u&s;ed to &s;ee her with you at Mrs. Harrel's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, much di&s;con|certed, <Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;he is not hurt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not at all; but the lady with her is brui&s;ed to death; won't you come and &s;ee her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am too much in ha&s;te at pre&s;ent,&mdash;and I can do them no good; but Mrs.
<PB N="116" REF="115">
Charlton I am &s;ure will &s;pare her &s;ervant, if he can be of any u&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but the young lady wants to &s;peak to you; &s;he is coming up to the chai&s;e as fa&s;t as ever &s;he can."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how &s;hould &s;he know me?"</Q> cried Cecilia, with much &s;urpri&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure &s;he could not &s;ee me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I told her,"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice, with a nod of &s;elf-approbation for what he had done, <Q REND="inline">"I told her it was you, for I knew I could &s;oon overtake you."</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;plea&s;ure at this officiou&s;ne&s;s was una|vailing, for looking out of the window, &s;he perceived Mi&s;s Larolles, followed by half her party, not three paces from the chai&s;e."</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my dear creature,"</Q> &s;he called out, <Q REND="inline">"what a terrible accident! I a&s;&s;ure you I am &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly frightened you've no idea. It's the luckie&s;t thing in the world that you were going this way. Never any thing happened &s;o exce&s;&s;ively provoking; you've no notion what a fall we've had. It's hor|rid &s;hocking, I a&s;&s;ure you. How have you been all this time? You can't conceive how glad I am to &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And to which will Mi&s;s Beverley an|&s;wer fir&s;t,"</Q> cried a voice which announced Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"the joy or the &s;orrow? For &s;o adroitly are they blended, that a
<PB N="117" REF="116">
common auditor could with difficulty de|cide whether condolence, or congratulation &s;hould have the precedency."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How can you be &s;o exce&s;&s;ive horrid,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">to talk of congratula|tion, when one's in &s;uch a &s;hocking panic that one does not know if one's dead or alive!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dead, then, for any wager,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"if we may judge by your &s;tillne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I de&s;ire, now, you won't begin jok|ing,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for I a&s;&s;ure you it's an exce&s;&s;ive &s;erious affair. I was never &s;o re|joiced in my life as when I found I was not killed. I've been &s;o &s;queezed you've no notion. I thought for a full hour I had broke both my arms."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And my heart at the &s;ame time,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port; <Q REND="inline">"I hope you did not ima|gine that the lea&s;t fragile of the three?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All our hearts, give me leave to add,"</Q> &s;aid Captain Are&s;by&mdash;ju&s;t then advancing, <Q REND="inline">"all our hearts mu&s;t have been <HI>abim&eacute;s,</HI> by the indi&s;po&s;ition of Mi&s;s Larolles, had not their doom been fortunately revoked by the &s;ight of Mi&s;s Beverley."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, this is exce&s;&s;ive odd,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"that every body &s;hould run away &s;o from poor Mrs. Mears; &s;he'll be &s;o affronted you've no idea. I thought, Cap|tain
<PB N="118" REF="117">
Are&s;by, you would have &s;tayed to take care of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll run and fee how &s;he is my&s;elf,"</Q> cried Morrice, and away he gallopped.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"I am quite <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> to have failed in any of my devoirs; but I make it a principle to be a mere looker on upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to commit any <HI>fauxpas</HI> by too much <HI>empre&s;&s;ement.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An admirable caution!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"and, to &s;o ardent a temper, a nece&s;&s;ary check!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, whom the &s;urpri&s;e and vexation of &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a meeting, when &s;he particularly wi&s;hed to have e&s;caped all no|tice, had hitherto kept in painful &s;ilence, began now to recover &s;ome pre&s;ence of mind; and making her compliments to Mi&s;s Larolles and Mr. Go&s;port, with a &s;light bow to the Captain, &s;he apologized for hurrying away, but told them &s;he had an engagement in London which could not be deferred, and was then giving orders to the po&s;tilion to drive on, when Morrice re|turning full &s;peed, called out <Q REND="inline">"The poor lady's &s;o bad &s;he is not able to &s;tir a &s;tep; &s;he can't put a foot to the ground, and &s;he &s;ays &s;he's quite black and blue; &s;o I told her I was &s;ure Mi&s;s Beverley would not re|fu&s;e to make room for her in her chai&s;e, till
<PB N="119" REF="118">
the other can be put to rights; and &s;he &s;ays &s;he &s;hall take it as a great favour. Here, po&s;tilion, a little more to the right! come, ladies and gentlemen, get out of the way."</Q></P>
<P>This impertinence, however extraordi|nary, Cecilia could not oppo&s;e; for Mrs. Charlton, ever compa&s;&s;ionate and comply|ing where there was any appearance of di&s;tre&s;s, in&s;tantly &s;econded the propo&s;al: the chai&s;e, therefore, was turned back, and &s;he was obliged to offer a place in it to Mrs. Mears, who, though more frightened than hurt, readily accepted it, notwith&s;tanding, to make way for her without incommoding Mrs. Charlton, &s;he was forced to get out her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She failed not, however, to de&s;ire that all po&s;&s;ible expedition might be u&s;ed in refit|ting the other chai&s;e for their reception; and all the gentlemen but one, di&s;mounted their hor&s;es, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or &s;eem to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in getting it ready.</P>
<P>This only unconcerned &s;pectator in the mid&s;t of the apparent general bu&s;tle, was Mr. Meadows; who viewed all that pa&s;&s;ed without troubling him&s;elf to interfere, and with an air of the mo&s;t evident carele&s;sne&s;s whether matters went well or went ill.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles, now returning to the &s;cene of action, &s;uddenly &s;creamed out, <Q REND="inline">"O dear, where's my little dog! I never thought
<PB N="120" REF="119">
of him, I declare! I love him better than any thing in the world. I would not have him hurt for an hundred thou&s;and pounds. Lord, where is he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cru&s;hed or &s;uffocated in the overturn, no doubt,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port; <Q REND="inline">"but as you mu&s;t have been his executioner, what &s;ofter death could he die? If you will your|&s;elf inflict the puni&s;hment, I will &s;ubmit to the &s;ame fate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, how you love to plague one!"</Q> cried &s;he: and then enquired among the &s;er|vants what was become of her dog. The poor little animal, forgotten by its mi&s;tre&s;s, and di&s;regarded by all others, was now di&s;covered by its yelping; and &s;oon found to have been the mo&s;t material &s;ufferer by the overturn, one of its fore legs being broken.</P>
<P>Could &s;creams or lamentations, re|proaches to the &s;ervants, or complaints again&s;t the De&s;tinies, have abated his pain, or made a callus of the fracture, but &s;hort would have been the duration of his mi&s;ery; for neither words were &s;aved, nor lungs were &s;pared, the very air was rent with cries, and all pre&s;ent were upbraided as if accomplices in the di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The po&s;tilion, at length, interrupted this vociferation with news that the chai&s;e was again fit for u&s;e; and Cecilia, eager to be
<PB N="121" REF="120">
gone, finding him little regarded, repeated what he &s;aid to Mi&s;s Larolles.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The chai&s;e?"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why you don't &s;uppo&s;e I'll ever get into that horrid chai&s;e any more? I do a&s;&s;ure you I would not upon any account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not get into it?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for what purpo&s;e, then, have we all waited till it was ready?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I declare I would not go in it for forty thou&s;and worlds. I would rather walk to an inn, if it's a hundred and fifty miles off."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But as it happens,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"to be only &s;even miles, I fancy you will conde&s;cend to ride."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Seven miles! Lord how &s;hocking! you frighten me &s;o you have no idea. Poor Mrs. Mears! She'll have to go quite alone. I dare &s;ay the chai&s;e will be down fifty times by the way. Ten to one but &s;he breaks her neck! only conceive how horrid! I a&s;&s;ure you I am exce&s;&s;ive glad I am out of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very friendly, indeed!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port. <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Mears, then, may break her bones at her lei&s;ure!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mears, however, when applied to, profe&s;&s;ed an equal aver&s;ion to the carriage in which &s;he had been &s;o unfortunate, and declared &s;he would rather walk than return

<P>Cecilia, though in the utmo&s;t con&s;terna|tion at a propo&s;al, which mu&s;t &s;o long re|tard a journey &s;he had &s;o many rea&s;ons to wi&s;h ha&s;tened, knew not how either in de|cency or humanity to oppo&s;e it: and the fear of rai&s;ing &s;u&s;picion, from a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s how much there was to &s;u&s;pect, forced her to curb her impatience, and reduced her even to repeat the offer which Morrice had made, though &s;he could &s;carce look at him for anger at his un&s;ea&s;onable forward|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>No voice di&s;&s;enting, the troop began to be formed. The foot con&s;i&s;ted of the two young ladies and Mr. Go&s;port, who alighted to walk with Cecilia; the cavalry, of Mr. Meadows, the Captain, and Morrice, who walked their hor&s;es a foot pace, while
<PB N="123" REF="122">
the re&s;t of the party rode on with the chai&s;e, as attendants upon Mrs. Mears.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before they &s;et off, Mr. Meadows, riding negligently up to the carriage, ex|erted him&s;elf &s;o far as to &s;ay to Mrs. Mears, <Q REND="inline">"Are you hurt, ma'am?"</Q> and, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;eeming to recollect Cecilia, he turned about, and yawning while he touched his hat, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"O, how d'ye do, ma'am?"</Q> and then, without waiting an an&s;wer to either of his que&s;tions, flapped it over his eyes, and joined the cavalcade, though without appearing to have any con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s that he belonged to it.</P>
<P>Cecilia would mo&s;t gladly have u&s;ed the rejected chai&s;e her&s;elf, but could not make &s;uch a propo&s;al to Mrs. Charlton, who was pa&s;t the age and the courage for even any appearance of enterprize. Upon enquiry, however, &s;he had the &s;atisfaction to hear that the di&s;tance to the next &s;tage was but two miles, though multiplied to &s;even by the malice of Mr. Go&s;port.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles carried her little dog in her arms, declaring &s;he would never more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">u&s;t him a moment away from her.

<PB N="124" REF="123">
they were ju&s;t returning home when the chai&s;e broke down.</P>
<P>She then proceeded, with her u&s;ual vo|lubility, to relate the little nothings that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the winter, flying from &s;ubject to &s;ubject, with no meaning but to be heard, and no wi&s;h but to talk, ever rapid in &s;peech, though minute in detail. This loquacity met not with any interrup|tion, &s;ave now and then a &s;arca&s;tic remark from Mr. Go&s;port; for Cecilia was too much occupied by her own affairs, to an&s;wer or li&s;ten to &s;uch unintere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Her &s;ilence, however, was at length forcibly broken; Mr. Go&s;port, taking ad|vantage of the fir&s;t moment Mi&s;s Larolles &s;topt for breath, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray what carries you to town, Mi&s;s Beverley, at this time of the year?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who&s;e thoughts had been wholly employed upon what would pa&s;s at her ap|proaching meeting with Delvile, was &s;o entirely unprepared for this que&s;tion, that &s;he could make to it no manner of an&s;wer, till Mr. Go&s;port, in a tone of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, repeated it, and then, not without he&s;ita|tion, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, in London,&mdash;pray how long have you been in the country?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="124">
<Q REND="inline">"Bu&s;ine&s;s, have you?"</Q> cried he, &s;truck by her eva&s;ion; <Q REND="inline">"and pray what can you and bu&s;ine&s;s have in common?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More than you may imagine,"</Q> an|&s;wered &s;he, with greater &s;teadine&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"and perhaps before long I may even have enough to teach me the enjoyment of lei&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you don't pretend to play my Lady Notable, and become your own &s;teward?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what can I do better?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What? Why &s;eek one ready made to take the trouble off your hands.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, laugh|ing, <Q REND="inline">"I have not been looking out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And have none &s;uch made application to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no,&mdash;I believe not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fie, fie! no regi&s;ter-office keeper has been pe&s;tered with more claimants. You know they a&s;&s;ault you by dozens."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t pardon me, indeed, I know not any &s;uch thing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="125">
<Q REND="inline">"You know, then, why they do not, and that is much the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I may conjecture why, at lea&s;t, the place, I &s;uppo&s;e, is not worth the &s;ervice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no; the place, they conclude, is already &s;eized, and the fee-&s;imple of the e&s;tate is the heart of the owner. Is it not &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The heart of the owner,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, a little confu&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"may, indeed, be &s;imple, but not, perhaps, &s;o ea&s;ily &s;eized as you imagine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you, then, wi&s;ely &s;aved it from a &s;torm, by a generous &s;urrender? you have been, indeed, in an excellent &s;chool for the &s;tudy both of attack and defence; Delvile-Ca&s;tle is a fortre&s;s which, even in ruins, proves its &s;trength by its antiquity: and it teaches, al&s;o, an admirable le&s;&s;on, by di&s;playing the dangerous, the infallible power of time, which defies all might, and undermines all &s;trength; which breaks down every barrier, and &s;hews nothing en|durable but it&s;elf."</Q> Then looking at her with an arch earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I think,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"you made a long vi&s;it there; did this ob&s;ervation never occur to you? did you never perceive, never <HI>feel,</HI> rather, the in&s;idious properties of time?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, certainly, an&s;wered &s;he,"</Q> alarmed at the very mention of Delvile-Ca&s;tle, yet
<PB N="127" REF="126">
affecting to under&s;tand literally what was &s;aid metaphorieally, <Q REND="inline">"the havock of time upon the place could not fail &s;trik|ing me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was its havock,"</Q> &s;aid he, yet more archly, <Q REND="inline">"merely external? is all within &s;afe? &s;ound and firm? and did the length of your re&s;idence &s;hew its power by no new mi&s;chief?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Doubtle&s;s, not,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with the &s;ame pretended ignorance, <Q REND="inline">"the place is not in &s;o de&s;perate a condition as to exhibit any vi&s;ible marks of decay in the cour&s;e of three or four months."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, do you not know,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"that the place to which I allude may receive a mi&s;chief in as many minutes which double the number of years cannot rectify? The internal parts of a building are not le&s;s vulnerable to accident than its out&s;ide; and though the evil may more ea&s;ily be concealed, it will with greater difficulty be remedied. Many a fair &s;truc|ture have I &s;een, which, like that now be|fore me,"</Q> (looking with much &s;ignificance at Cecilia,) <Q REND="inline">"has to the eye &s;eemed per|fect in all its parts, and unhurt either by time or ca&s;ualty, while within, &s;ome lurk|ing evil, &s;ome latent injury, has &s;ecretly worked its way into the very <HI>heart</HI> of the edifice, where it has con&s;umed its &s;trength,

and laid wa&s;te its powers, till, &s;inking deeper and deeper, it has &s;apped its very founda|tion, before the &s;uper&s;tructure has exhibited any token of danger. Is &s;uch an accident among the things you hold to be po&s;&s;ible?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your language,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, colouring very high, <Q REND="inline">"is &s;o florid, that I mu&s;t own it renders your meaning rather ob&s;cure."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> interrupted &s;he, with invo|luntary quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"why &s;hould I trouble you to make illu&s;trations?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray, my dear creature,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"how is Mrs. Harrel? I was never &s;o &s;orry for any body in my life. I quite forgot to a&s;k after her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, poor Harrel!"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"he was a great lo&s;s to his friends. I had ju&s;t begun to have a regard for him: we were growing extremely intimate. Poor fellow! he really gave mo&s;t excellent dinners."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Harrel?"</Q> &s;uddenly exclaimed Mr. Meadows, who &s;eemed ju&s;t then to fir&s;t hear what was going forward, <Q REND="inline">"who was he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, as good-natured a fellow as ever I knew in my life,"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"he was never out of humour: he was drinking
<PB N="129" REF="128">
and &s;inging and dancing to the very la&s;t moment. Don't you remember him, Sir, that night at Vauxhall?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows made not any an&s;wer, but rode languidly on.</P>
<P>Morrice, ever more flippant than &s;aga|cious, called out, <Q REND="inline">"I really believe the gentleman's deaf! he won't &s;o much as &s;ay <HI>umph,</HI> and <HI>hay,</HI> now; but I'll give him &s;uch a hallow in his ears, as &s;hall make him hear me whether he will or no. Sir! I &s;ay!"</Q> bawling aloud, <Q REND="inline">"have you forgot that night at Vauxhall?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, &s;tarting at being thus &s;houted at, looked towards Morrice with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Were you &s;o obliging, Sir, as to &s;peak to me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, yes, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, amazed; <Q REND="inline">"I thought you had a&s;ked &s;omething about Mr. Harrel, &s;o I ju&s;t made an an&s;wer to it;&mdash;that's all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir you are very good,"</Q> returned he, &s;lightly bowing, and then looking another way, as if thoroughly &s;atisfied with what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I &s;ay, Sir,"</Q> re&s;uined Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"don't you remember how Mr. Harrel&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. who, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Harrel, Sir; was not you ju&s;t now a&s;king me who he was?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129">
<Q REND="inline">"O, ay, true,"</Q> cried Meadows, in a tone of extreme we wearine&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I am much obliged to you. Pray give my re&s;pects to him."</Q> And, touching his hat, he was riding away; but the a&s;toni&s;hed Morrice called out, <Q REND="inline">"Your re&s;pects to him? why lord! Sir, don't you know he's dead?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dead?&mdash;who, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why Mr. Harrel, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Harrel?&mdash;O, very true,"</Q> cried Mea|dows, with a face of &s;udden recollection; <Q REND="inline">"he &s;hot him&s;elf, I think, or was knocked down, or &s;omething of that &s;ort. I re|member it perfectly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"don't let's talk about it, it's the cruelle&s;t thing I ever knew in my life. I a&s;&s;ure you I was &s;o &s;hocked, I thought I &s;hould never have got the better of it. I remember the next night at Ranelagh I could talk of nothing el&s;e. I dare &s;ay I told it to 500 people. I a&s;&s;ure you I was tired to death; only conceive how di&s;tre&s;&s;ing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An excellent method,"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;|port, <Q REND="inline">"to drive it out of your own head, by driving it into the heads of your neigh|bours! But were you not afraid, by &s;uch an ebullition of pathos, to bur&s;t as many hearts as you had auditors?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"every body was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive &s;hocked you've no
<PB N="131" REF="130">
notion; one heard of nothing el&s;e; all the world was raving mad about it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really yes,"</Q> cried the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ubject was <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> upon one <HI>partout.</HI> There was &s;carce any breathing for it: it poured from all directions; I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was <HI>aneanti</HI> with it to a degree."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But the mo&s;t &s;hocking thing in na|ture,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"was going to the &s;ale. I never mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle day. One u&s;ed to meet the whole world there, and every body was &s;o &s;orry you can't con|ceive. It was quite horrid. I a&s;&s;ure you I never &s;uffered &s;o much before; it made me &s;o unhappy you can't imagine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I am mo&s;t ready to grant,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"be the powers of imagina|tion ever &s;o excentric."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Robert Floyer and Mr. Marriot,"</Q> continued Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"have behaved &s;o ill you've no idea, for they have done nothing ever &s;ince but &s;ay how mon&s;trou&s;ly Mr. Harrel had cheated them, and how they lo&s;t &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums by him;&mdash;only conceive how ill-natured!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And they complain,"</Q> cried Mor|rice, <Q REND="inline">"that old Mr. Delvile u&s;ed them wor&s;e; for that when they had been de|frauded of all that money on purpo&s;e to pay their addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Beverley, he would never let them &s;ee her, but all of a
<PB N="132" REF="131">
&s;udden took her off into the country, on purpo&s;e to marry her to his own &s;on."</Q></P>
<P>The cheeks of Cecilia now glowed with the deepe&s;t blu&s;hes; but finding by a ge|neral &s;ilence that &s;he was expected to make &s;ome an&s;wer, &s;he &s;aid, with what unconcern &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, <Q REND="inline">"They were very much mi&s;taken; Mr. Delvile had no &s;uch view."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed?"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;port, again perceiving her change of countenance; <Q REND="inline">"and is it po&s;&s;ible you have actually e&s;caped a &s;iege, while every body con|cluded you taken by a&s;&s;ault? Pray where is young Delvile at pre&s;ent?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't&mdash;I can't tell, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it long &s;ince you have &s;een him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is two months,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with yet more he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I was at Del|vile-Ca&s;tle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, but,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"did not you &s;ee him while he was in Suffolk? I believe, indeed, he is there now, for it was only ye&s;terday I heard of his coming down, by a gentleman who called upon Lady Margaret, and told us he had &s;een a &s;tranger, a day or two ago, at Mrs. Charlton's door, and when he a&s;ked who he was, they told him his name was Delvile, and &s;aid he was on a vi&s;it at Mr. Biddulph's."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="132">
Cecilia was quite confounded by this &s;peech; to have it known that Delvile had vi&s;ited her, was in it&s;elf alarming, but to have her own equivocation thus glaringly expo&s;ed, was infinitely more dangerous. The ju&s;t &s;u&s;picions to which it mu&s;t give ri&s;e filled her with dread, and the palpable eva&s;ion in which &s;he had been di&s;covered, overwhelmed her with confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So you had forgotton,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;|port, looking at her with much archne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"that you had &s;een him <HI>within</HI> the two months? but no wonder; for where is the lady who having &s;o many admirers, can be at the trouble to remember which of them &s;he &s;aw la&s;t? or who, being &s;o accu&s;tomed to adulation, can hold it worth while to enquire whence it comes? A thou&s;and Mr. Delviles are to Mi&s;s Beverley but as one; u&s;ed from them all to the &s;ame tale, &s;he regards them not individually as lovers, but collectively as men; and to gather, even from her&s;elf, which &s;he is mo&s;t in|clined to favour, &s;he mu&s;t probably de&s;ire, like Portia in the Merchant of Venice, that their names may be run over one by one, before &s;he can di&s;tinctly tell which is which."</Q></P>
<P>The gallant gaiety of this &s;peech was &s;ome relief to Cecilia, who was beginning a laughing reply, when Morrice called out,
<PB N="134" REF="133">
<Q REND="inline">"That man looks as if he was upon the &s;cout."</Q> And, rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;he per|ceived a man on hor&s;eback, who, though much muffled up, his hat flapped, and a handkerchief held to his mouth and chin, &s;he in&s;tantly, by his air and figure, recog|nized to be Delvile.</P>
<P>In much con&s;ternation at this &s;ight, &s;he forgot what &s;he meant to &s;ay, and dropping her eyes, walked &s;ilently on. Mr. Go&s;|port, attentive to her motions, looked from her to the hor&s;eman, and after a &s;hort exa|mination, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think I have &s;een that man before; have <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Me?&mdash;no,"</Q>&mdash;an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I believe not,&mdash;I hardly, indeed, &s;ee him now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> have, I am pretty &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid Mor|rice; <Q REND="inline">"and if I could &s;ee his face, I dare &s;ay I &s;hould recollect him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He &s;eems very willing to know if he can recollect any of <HI>us,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"and, if I am not mi&s;taken, he &s;ees much better than he is &s;een."</Q></P>
<P>He was now come up to them, and though a glance &s;ufficed to di&s;cover the object of his &s;earch, the &s;ight of the party with which &s;he was &s;urrounded made him not care &s;top or &s;peak to her, and therefore, clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, he gallopped pa&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="134">
<Q REND="inline">"See,"</Q> cried Morrice, looking after him, <Q REND="inline">"how he turns round to examine us! I wonder who he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps &s;ome highwayman!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles; <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you I am in a prodigious fright: I &s;hould hate to be robbed &s;o you can't think."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was going to make much the &s;ame conjecture,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"and, if I am not greatly deceived, that man is a robber of no common &s;ort. What think you, Mi&s;s Beverley, can you di&s;cern a thief in di&s;gui&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed; I pretend to no &s;uch ex|traordinary knowledge."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's true; for all that you pretend is extraordinary ignorance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have a good mind,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"to ride after him, and &s;ee what he is about."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What for?"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, greatly alarmed; <Q REND="inline">"there can certainly be no oc|ca&s;ion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, pray don't,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"for, I a&s;&s;ure you, if he &s;hould come back to rob us, I &s;hould die upon the &s;pot. No|thing could be &s;o di&s;agreeable; I &s;hould &s;cream &s;o, you've no idea."</Q></P>
<P>Morrice then gave up the propo&s;al, and they walked quietly on; but Cecilia was
<PB N="136" REF="135">
extremely di&s;turbed by this accident; &s;he readily conjectured that, impatient for her arrival, Delvile had ridden that way, to &s;ee what had retarded her, and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that nothing could be &s;o de&s;irable as an im|mediate explanation of the motive of her journey. Such a meeting, therefore, had &s;he been alone, was ju&s;t what &s;he could have wi&s;hed, though, thus unluckily en|compa&s;&s;ed, it only added to her anxiety.</P>
<P>Involuntarily, however, &s;he quickened her pace, through her eagerne&s;s to be relieved from &s;o trouble&s;ome a party: but Mi&s;s La|rolles, who was in no &s;uch ha&s;te, prote&s;ted &s;he could not keep up with her; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"You don't con&s;ider that I have got this &s;weet little dog to carry, and he is &s;uch a &s;hocking plague to me you've no notion.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, ma'am,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"let me take him for you; I'll be very careful of him, I promi&s;e you; and you need not be afraid to tru&s;t me, for I under&s;tand more about dogs than about any thing."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles, after many fond care&s;&s;es, being really weary, con&s;ented, and Morrice placed the little animal before him on hor&s;eback: but while this matter was ad|ju&s;ting, and Mi&s;s Larolles was giving direc|tions how &s;he would have it held, Morrice exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Look, Look! that man is

<P>This &s;peech again &s;ilenced Cecilia, who perceived, with the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, that

both Delvile and her&s;elf were undoubtedly &s;u&s;pected by Mr. Go&s;port, if not already actually betrayed to him. She was obliged, therefore, to let the matter take its cour&s;e, though quite &s;ick with apprehen&s;ion le&s;t a full di&s;covery &s;hould follow the projected pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity and affectation he had buried common &s;en&s;e, &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, upon the reque&s;t of Cecilia, that he would not go, and, with a &s;hrug of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Give me leave to own I am <HI>parfaitment</HI> in a &s;tate the mo&s;t <HI>accablant</HI> in the world: nothing could give me greater plea|&s;ure than to profit of the occa&s;ion to ac|commodate either of the&s;e ladies; but as they proceed upon different principles, I am <HI>indecid&eacute;</HI> to a degree which way to turn my&s;elf!"</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"I'm for a&s;king him a few que&s;tions too; &s;o is the Captain; &s;o every body has &s;poke but you, Sir,"</Q> ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Meadows, <Q REND="inline">"So now, Sir, let's hear your opinion."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows, appearing wholly inat|tentive, rode on. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir! I &s;ay!"</Q> cried Morris, louder, <Q REND="inline">"we are all wait|ing for your vote. Pray what is the gen|tleman's name? it's duced hard to make him hear one."</Q></P>

<P>This account, however little alluring in it&s;elf, of his celebrity, was yet &s;ufficient to make Morrice covet his further acquaint|ance: for Morrice was ever attentive to turn his plea&s;ure to his profit, and never negligent of his intere&s;t, but when ignorant how to pur&s;ue it.

<P>Mr. Meadows made not any an&s;wer; but when Morrice was going to repeat his que&s;tion, without appearing even to know that he was near him, he abruptly &s;aid to Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"Pray what is become of Mrs. Mears? I don't &s;ee her among&s;t us."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"O, ay, true,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I had quite forgot it; I beg your pardon, indeed. Yes, I recollect now,&mdash;&s;he fell off her hor&s;e."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Her chai&s;e, was it?&mdash;ay, true, &s;o it was. Poor thing!&mdash;I am glad &s;he was not hurt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not hurt? Why &s;he's &s;o exce&s;&s;ively brui&s;ed, &s;he cant &s;tir a &s;tep! Only con|ceive what a memory you've got!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am mo&s;t extremely &s;orry for her in|deed,"</Q> cried he, again &s;tretching him&s;elf and yawning; <Q REND="inline">"poor &s;oul!&mdash;I hope &s;he won't die. Do you think &s;he will!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Die!"</Q> repeated Mi&s;s Larolles, with a &s;cream, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, how &s;hocking! You are really enough to frighten one to hear you."</Q></P>

Mi&s;s Larolles &s;creamed after him to give her fir&s;t her little dog; but with a &s;chool|boy's eagerne&s;s to be foremo&s;t, he gal|lopped on without heeding her.</P>
<P>The unea&s;ine&s;s of Cecilia now encrea&s;ed every moment; the di&s;covery of Delvile &s;eemed unavoidable, and his impatient and indi&s;creet watchfulne&s;s mu&s;t have rendered the motives of his di&s;gui&s;e but too glaring. All &s;he had left to hope was arriving at the inn before the detection was announced, and at lea&s;t &s;aving her&s;elf the cruel mortifi|cation of hearing the raillery which would follow it.</P>
<P>Even this, however, was not allowed her; Mi&s;s Larolles, whom &s;he had no means to quit, hardly &s;tirred another &s;tep, from her anxiety for her dog, and the earne&s;tne&s;s of her curio&s;ity about the &s;tranger.

<P><Q REND="inline">"We could not for our lives overtake the fellow,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"he was well mounted, I promi&s;e you, and I'll warrant he knows what he's about, for he turned off &s;o &s;hort at a place where there were two narrow lanes, that we could not make out wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> way he went."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="142">
Cecilia, relieved and delighted by this unexpected e&s;cape, now recovered her compo&s;ure, and was content to &s;aunter on without repining.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But though we could not &s;eize his per&s;on,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"we have debar|ra&s;&s;ed our&s;elves <HI>tout a fait</HI> from his pur&s;uit; I hope, therefore, Mi&s;s Larolles will make a revoke of her apprehen&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this was nothing but a loud &s;cream, with an exclamation, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, where's my dog?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your dog!"</Q> cried Morrice, looking agha&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"good &s;tars! I never thought of him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How exce&s;&s;ive barbarous!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"you've killed him, I dare &s;ay. Only think how &s;hocking! I had rather have &s;een any body &s;erved &s;o in the world. I &s;hall never forgive it, I a&s;&s;ure you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"How can you &s;uppo&s;e I've killed him? Poor, pretty creature, I'am &s;ure I liked him pro|digiou&s;ly.

<P>Away again rode Morrice.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I wi&s;h you would with all my heart; for I a&s;&s;ure you if I don't find him, I &s;hall think it &s;o exce&s;&s;ive di&s;tre&s;&s;ing you can't conceive."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain touched his hat, and was gone.</P>
<P>The&s;e repeated impediments almo&s;t robbed Cecilia of all patience; yet her total inability of re&s;i&s;tance obliged her to &s;ubmit, and compelled her to go, &s;top, or turn, according to their own motions.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"New if Mr. Meadows had the lea&s;t good-nature in the world,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"he would offer to help us; but he's &s;o exce&s;&s;ive odd, that I believe if we were all of us to fall down and break our necks, he would be &s;o ab&s;ent he would hardly take the trouble to a&s;k us how we did."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why in &s;o de&s;perate a ca&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"the trouble would be rather &s;uperfluous. However, don't repine that one of the cavaliers &s;tays with us by way of guard, le&s;t your friend the &s;py &s;hould

<P>Mi&s;s Larolles then, running up to Mr. Meadows, called out, <Q REND="inline">"I have a pro|digious immen&s;e favour to a&s;k of you, Mr. Meadows."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am!"</Q> cried Mr. Meadows, with his u&s;ual &s;tart.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's only to know, whether if that hor|rid creature &s;hould come back, you could not ju&s;t ride up to him and &s;hoot him, before he gets to us? Now will you pro|mi&s;e me to do it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are va&s;tly good,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a vacant &s;mile; <Q REND="inline">"what a charming evening! Do you love the country?</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"The country? O no! I dete&s;t it! Du&s;ty hedges, and chirping &s;parrows! 'Tis amazing to me any body can exi&s;t upon &s;uch terms."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="145">
<Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"I'm quite of your opinion. I hate the country &s;o you've no notion. I wi&s;h with all my heart it was all under ground. I declare, when I fir&s;t go into it for the &s;um|mer, I cry &s;o you can't think. I like nothing but London.&mdash;Don't you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"London!"</Q> repeated Mr. Meadows, <Q REND="inline">"O melancholy! the &s;ink of all vice and depravity. Streets without light! Hou&s;es without air!

<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mr. Meadows,"</Q> cried &s;he, an|grily, <Q REND="inline">"I believe you would have one live no where!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, very true, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid he, yawn|ing, <Q REND="inline">one really lives no where; one does but vegetate, and wi&s;h it all at an end. Don't you find it &s;o, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me? no indeed; I a&s;&s;ure you I like living of all things. Whenever I'm ill, I'm in &s;uch a fright you've no idea. I always think I'm going to die, and it puts me &s;o out of &s;pirits you can't think. Does not it you, too?"</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Meadows, looking another way, began to whi&s;tle.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"how

exce&s;&s;ive di&s;tre&s;&s;ing! to a&s;k one que&s;tions, and then never hear what one an&s;wers!"</Q></P>
<P>Here the Captain returned alone; and Mi&s;s Larolles, flying to meet him, de|manded where was her dog?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have the <HI>malheur</HI> to a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"that I never was more <HI>ane|anti</HI> in my life! the pretty little fellow has broke another leg!"</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles, in a pa&s;&s;ion of grief, then declared &s;he was certain that Morrice had maimed him thus on purpo&s;e, and de&s;ired to know where the vile wretch was?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed at the incident,"</Q> replied the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"that he rode in&s;tantly another way. I took up the pretty fellow therefore my&s;elf, and have done <HI>mon po&s;&s;ible</HI> not to derange him."</Q></P>
<P>The unfortunate little animal was then delivered to Mi&s;s Larolles; and after much lamentation, they at length continued their walk, and, without further adventure, ar|rived at the inn.</P>

<P>BUT here, in&s;tead of finding, as &s;he expected, Mrs. Charlton and fre&s;h hor&s;es in readine&s;s, Cecilia &s;aw neither chai&s;e nor preparation; Mrs. Charlton was quietly &s;eated in a parlour, and drinking tea with Mrs. Mears.</P>
<P>Vexed and di&s;appointed, &s;he ordered hor&s;es immediately to the chai&s;e, and en|treated Mrs. Charlton to lo&s;e no more time. But the various delays which had already retarded them, had made it now &s;o late that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get into London by day|light, and Mrs. Charlton not having cou|rage to be upon the road after dark, had &s;ettled to &s;leep at the inn, and purpo&s;ed not to proceed till the next morning.</P>
<P>Half di&s;tracted at this new difficulty, Ce|cilia begged to &s;peak with her alone, and then
<PB N="149" REF="148">
repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there was for her being in London that night: <Q REND="inline">"Every thing,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"depends upon it, and the whole purpo&s;e of my journey will otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t, for Mr. Delvile will el&s;e think him|&s;elf extremely ill u&s;ed, and to make him reparation, I may be compelled to &s;ubmit to almo&s;t whatever terms he &s;hall propo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, kind and yielding, with|&s;tood not this entreaty, which Cecilia made with infinite pain to her&s;elf, from the reluc|tance &s;he felt to pur&s;uing her own intere&s;t and inclination in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of her worthy old friend: but as &s;he was now cir|cum&s;tanced, &s;he con&s;idered the immediate pro&s;ecution of her journey as her only re|&s;ource again&s;t fir&s;t irritating Delvile by an abrupt di&s;appointment, and appea&s;ing him next by a conce&s;&s;ion which would make that di&s;appointment end in nothing.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e was &s;oon ready, and Mrs. Charlton and Cecilia were ri&s;ing to take leave of the company, when a man and hor&s;e gallopped full &s;peed into the inn-yard, and in le&s;s than a minute, Morrice bounced into the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ladies and gentlemen,"</Q> cried he, quite out of breath with ha&s;te, <Q REND="inline">"I have got &s;ome news for you! I've ju&s;t &s;ound out
<PB N="150" REF="149">
who that per&s;on is that has been watching us."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;tarting at this mo&s;t unwelcome intelligence, would now have run into the chai&s;e without hearing him proceed; but Mrs. Charlton, who knew neither whom nor what he meant, involuntarily &s;topt, and Cecilia, who&s;e arm &s;he leant upon, was compelled to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Every one el&s;e eagerly de&s;ired to know who he was.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I'll tell you,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"how I found him out. I was thinking in my own mind what I could po&s;&s;ibly do to make amends for that unlucky accident about the dog, and ju&s;t then I &s;pied the very man that had made me drop him; &s;o I thought at lea&s;t I'd find out who he was. I rode up to him &s;o quick that he could not get away from me, though I &s;aw plainly it was the thing he meant. But &s;till he kept him&s;elf muffled up, ju&s;t as he did before. Not &s;o &s;nug, thought I, my friend, I &s;hall have you yet! It's a fine evening, Sir, &s;ays I; but he took no notice: &s;o then I came more to the point; Sir, &s;ays I, I think I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, though I quite forget where. Still he made no an&s;wer: if you have no objection, Sir, &s;ays I, I &s;hall be glad to ride with you, for the night's com|ing on, and we have neither of us a &s;ervant.
<PB N="151" REF="150">
But then, without a word &s;peaking, he rode on the quicker. However, I jogged by his &s;ide, as fa&s;t as he, and &s;aid, Pray, Sir, did you know any thing of that company you were looking at &s;o hard ju&s;t now? And at this he could hold out no longer; he turned to me in a mo&s;t fierce pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid pray, Sir, don't be trouble&s;ome. And then he got off; for when I found by his voice who he was, I let him alone."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who could bear to hear no more, again ha&s;tened Mrs. Charlton, who now moved on; but Morrice, &s;tepping between them both and the door, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Now do pray, Mi&s;s Beverley, gue&s;s who it was."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No indeed, I cannot,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"nor have I any time to hear. Come, dear madam, we &s;hall be very late indeed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> tell you before you go;&mdash;why it was young Mr. Delvile! the &s;ame that I &s;aw with you one night at the Pan|theon, and that I u&s;ed to meet la&s;t &s;pring at Mr. Harrel's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile!"</Q> repeated every one; <Q REND="inline">"very &s;trange he &s;hould not &s;peak."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, ma'am,"</Q> continued Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"is it not the &s;ame gentleman that was at Mr. Biddulph's?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, half dead with &s;hame and vexa|tion, &s;tammered out <Q REND="inline">"No, no,&mdash;I be|lieve
<PB N="152" REF="151">
not,&mdash;I can't tell;&mdash;I have not a mo|ment to &s;pare."</Q></P>
<P>And then, at la&s;t, got Mrs. Charlton out of the room, and into the chai&s;e. But thither, before &s;he could drive off, &s;he was followed by Mr. Go&s;port, who gravely came to offer his advice that &s;he would im|mediately lodge an information at the Pub|lic Office in Bow-Street, that a very &s;u&s;pi|cious looking man had been ob&s;erved loi|tering in tho&s;e parts, who appeared to har|bour mo&s;t dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t her per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>Cecilia was too much confounded to rally or reply, and Mr. Go&s;port returned to his party with his &s;peech unan&s;wered.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the journey was without any new ca&s;ualty, for late as it was, they e&s;|caped being robbed: but neither robbers nor new ca&s;ualties were wanting to make it unplea&s;ant to Cecilia; the incidents which had already happened &s;ufficed for that pur|po&s;e; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being &s;o generally betrayed, added to the delay of her recantation, prepared her for nothing but mortifications to her&s;elf, and conflicts with Delvile the mo&s;t bitter and &s;evere.</P>
<P>It was near ten o'clock before they ar|rived in Pall-Mall. The hou&s;e to which Delvile had given directions was ea&s;ily
<PB N="153" REF="152">
found, and the &s;ervant &s;ent forward had prepared the people of it for their reception.</P>
<P>In the cruelle&s;t anxiety and trepidation, Cecilia then counted every moment till Del|vile came. She planned an apology for her conduct with all the addre&s;s of which &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s, and determined to bear his di&s;appointment and indignation with firmne&s;s: yet the part &s;he had to act was both hard and artificial; &s;he &s;ighed to have it over, and repined &s;he mu&s;t have it at all.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant there was a knock at the door, &s;he flew out upon the &s;tairs to li&s;ten; and hearing his well-known voice enquir|ing for the ladies who had ju&s;t taken the lodgings, &s;he ran back to Mrs. Charlton, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam, a&s;&s;i&s;t me I entreat! for now mu&s;t I merit, or forfeit your e&s;teem for-ever!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you pardon,"</Q> cried Delvile, as he entered the room, <Q REND="inline">"an intru&s;ion which was not <HI>in our bond?</HI> But how could I wait till to-morrow, when I knew you were in town to-night?"</Q></P>
<P>He then made his compliments to Mrs. Charlton, and, after enquiring how &s;he had borne her journey, turned again to Cecilia, who&s;e unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations he &s;aw but too plainly in her countenance: <Q REND="inline">"Are you
<PB N="154" REF="153">
angry,"</Q> cried he, anxiou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"that I have ventured to come hither to night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, &s;truggling with all her feelings for compo&s;ure; <Q REND="inline">"what we wi&s;h is ea&s;ily excu&s;ed; and I am glad to &s;ee you to night, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She he&s;itated; and Delvile, little ima|gining why, thanked her in the warme&s;t terms for her conde&s;cen&s;ion. He then re|lated how he had been tormented by Mor|rice, enquired why Mr. Monckton had not accompanied her, and what could po&s;&s;ibly have induced her to make her journey &s;o late, or, with &s;o large a party, to be walk|ing upon the high road in&s;tead of ha&s;ten|ing to London.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wonder not,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, more &s;teadily, <Q REND="inline">"at your &s;urpri&s;e, though I have now no time to le&s;&s;en it. You have never, I find, received my letter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried he, much &s;truck by her manner; <Q REND="inline">"was it to forbid our meeting till to-morrow?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To-morrow!"</Q> &s;he repeated expre&s;|&s;ively, <Q REND="inline">"no; it was to forbid&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here the door was &s;uddenly opened, and Morrice bur&s;t into the room.</P>
<P>The di&s;may and a&s;toni&s;hment of Delvile at &s;ight of him could only be equalled by the confu&s;ion and con&s;ternation of Cecilia; but Morrice, perceiving neither, abruptly
<PB N="155" REF="154">
called out <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, I quite beg your pardon for coming &s;o late, but you mu&s;t know&mdash;"</Q> then &s;topping &s;hort upon &s;eeing Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"Good lord,"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"if here is not our <HI>gentleman &s;py!</HI> Why, Sir, you have not &s;pared the &s;pur! I left you gallopping off quite another way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"However that may be, Sir,"</Q> cried Delvile, equally enraged at the interruption and the ob&s;ervation, <Q REND="inline">"you did not, I pre|&s;ume, wait upon Mi&s;s Beverley to talk of <HI>me?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered he, lightly, <Q REND="inline">"for I had told her all about you at the inn. Did not I, Mi&s;s Beverley? Did not I tell you I was &s;ure it was Mr. Delvile that was dodg|ing us about &s;o? Though I believe, Sir, you thought I had not found you out?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, young man,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton, much offended by this familiar intru&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"how did you find <HI>us</HI> out?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, by the luckie&s;t acci|dent in the world! Ju&s;t as I was riding in|to town, I met the returned chai&s;e that brought you; and I knew the po&s;tilion very well, as I go that road pretty often: &s;o, by the mere&s;t chance in the world, I &s;aw him by the light of the moon. And then he told me where he had &s;et you down."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, Sir,"</Q> again a&s;ked Mrs.
<PB N="156" REF="155">
Charlton, <Q REND="inline">"what was your rea&s;on for mak|ing the enquiry?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, I had a little favour to a&s;k of Mi&s;s Beverley, that made me think I would take the liberty to call."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was this time of night, Sir,"</Q> &s;he returned, <Q REND="inline">"the only one you could chu&s;e for that purpo&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, I'll tell you how that was; I did not mean to have called till to|morrow morning; but as I was willing to know if the po&s;tilion had given me a right direction, I knocked one &s;oft little knock at the door, thinking you might be gone to bed after your journey, merely to a&s;k if it was the right hou&s;e; but when the &s;ervant told me there was a gentleman with you al|ready, I thought there would be no harm in ju&s;t &s;tepping for a moment up &s;tairs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, whom mingled &s;hame and vexation had hitherto kept &s;ilent, <Q REND="inline">"is your bu&s;ine&s;s with me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, ma'am, I only ju&s;t called to give you a direction to a mo&s;t excellent dog-doctor, as we call him, that lives at the corner of &mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A dog-doctor, Sir?"</Q> repeated Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and what have I to do with any &s;uch di|rection?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you mu&s;t know, ma'am, I have been in the greate&s;t concern imaginable
<PB N="157" REF="156">
about that accident which happened to me with the poor little dog, and &s;o&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What little dog, Sir?"</Q> cried Delvile, who now began to conclude he was not &s;ober, <Q REND="inline">"do you know what you are talk|ing of?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, for it was that very little dog you made me drop out of my arms, by which means he broke his other leg."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> made you drop him?"</Q> cried Delvile, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, you had much better call &s;ome other time; it does not ap|pear to me that you are in a proper &s;ituation for remaining here at pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, I &s;hall be gone in an in&s;tant,"</Q> an|&s;wered Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"I merely wanted to beg the favour of Mi&s;s Beverley to tell that young lady that owned the dog, that if &s;he will carry him to this man, I am &s;ure he will make a cure of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Delvile, convinced now of his inebriety, <Q REND="inline">"if you plea&s;e we will walk away together."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't mean to take <HI>you</HI> away, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, looking very &s;ignificantly, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;uppo&s;e you have not rode &s;o hard to go &s;o &s;oon; but as to me, I'll only write the direction, and be off."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, amazed and irritated at &s;o many following &s;pecimens of ignorant a&s;&s;urance, would not, in his pre&s;ent eagerne&s;s, have
<PB N="158" REF="157">
&s;crupled turning him out of the hou&s;e, had he not thought it imprudent, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to quarrel with him, and im|proper, at &s;o late an hour, to be left be|hind: he therefore only, while he was writ|ing the direction, told Cecilia, in a low voice, that he would get rid of him and re|turn in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>They then went together; leaving Cecilia in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all &s;he had hitherto experienced." <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mrs. Charl|ton,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"what refuge have I now from ridicule, or perhaps di&s;grace! Mr. Delvile has been detected watching me in di&s;gui&s;e! he has been di&s;covered at this late hour meeting me in private! The &s;tory will reach his family with all the hyperbole of exaggeration;&mdash;how will his noble mother di&s;dain me! how cruelly &s;hall I &s;ink before the &s;everity of her eye!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton tried to comfort her, but the effort was vain, and &s;he &s;pent her time in the bittere&s;t repining till eleven o'clock. Delvile's not returning then added wonder to her &s;adne&s;s, and the impropriety of his returning at all &s;o late, grew every in&s;tant more glaring.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, though in great di&s;turbance, and evidently much ruffled in his temper, he came: <Q REND="inline">"I feared,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I had pa&s;|&s;ed the time for admittance, and the tor|ture
<PB N="159" REF="158">
I have &s;uffered from being detained has almo&s;t driven me wild. I have been in mi|&s;ery to &s;ee you again,&mdash;your looks, your manner,&mdash;the letter you talk of,&mdash;all have filled me with alarm; and though I know not what it is, I have to dread, I find it im|po&s;&s;ible to re&s;t a moment without &s;ome ex|planation. Tell me, then, why you &s;eem thus &s;trange and thus depre&s;&s;ed? Tell me what that letter was to forbid? Tell me any thing, and every thing, but that you re|pent your conde&s;cen&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That letter,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"would have explained to you all. I &s;carce know how to communicate its contents: yet I hope you will hear with patience what I acknow|ledge I have re&s;olved upon only from ne|ce&s;&s;ity. That letter was to tell you that to|morrow we mu&s;t not meet;&mdash;it was to pre|pare you, indeed, for our meeting, perhaps, never more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gracious heaven!"</Q> exclaimed he, &s;tart|ing, <Q REND="inline">"what is it you mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I have made a promi&s;e too ra&s;h to be kept; that you mu&s;t pardon me if, late as it is, I retract, &s;ince I am convinced it was wrong, and mu&s;t be wretched in per|forming it."</Q></P>
<P>Confounded and di&s;mayed, for a moment he continued &s;ilent, and then pa&s;&s;ionately called out, <Q REND="inline">"Who has been with you to
<PB N="160" REF="159">
defame me in your opinion? Who has bar|barou&s;ly wronged my character &s;ince I left you la&s;t Monday? Mr. Monckton received me coldly,&mdash;has he injured me in your e&s;|teem? Tell, tell me but to whom I owe this change, that my vindication, if it re|&s;tores not your favour, may at lea&s;t make you cea&s;e to blu&s;h that once I was honoured with &s;ome &s;hare of it!'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It wants not to be re&s;tored,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, with much &s;oftne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince it has never been alienated. Be &s;atisfied that I think of you as I thought when we la&s;t parted, and generou&s;ly forbear to reproach me, when I a&s;&s;ure you I am actuated by principles which you ought not to di&s;ap|prove."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are you then, unchanged?"</Q> cried he, more gently, <Q REND="inline">"and is your e&s;teem for me &s;till&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought it ju&s;tice to &s;ay &s;o once,"</Q> cried &s;he, ha&s;tily interrupting him, <Q REND="inline">"but exact from me nothing more. It is too late for us now to talk any longer; to-mor|row you may find my letter at Mrs. Ro|berts's, and that, &s;hort as it is, contains my re&s;olution and its cau&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never,"</Q> cried he vehemently, <Q REND="inline">"can I quit you without knowing it! I would not linger till to-morrow in this &s;u&s;pence to be ma&s;ter of the univer&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="160">
<Q REND="inline">"I have told it you, Sir, already: what|ever is clande&s;tine carries a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil, and &s;o repugnant do I find it to my di&s;|po&s;ition and opinions, that till you give me back the promi&s;e I &s;o unworthily made, I mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to peace, becau&s;e at war with my own actions and my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Recover, then, your peace,"</Q> cried Delvile, with much emotion, <Q REND="inline">"for I here acquit you of all promi&s;e!&mdash;to fetter, to compel you, were too inhuman to afford me any happine&s;s. Yet hear me, di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionately hear me, and deliberate a moment before you re&s;olve upon my exile. Your &s;cruples I am not now going combat, I grieve that they are &s;o powerful, but I have no new arguments with which to oppo&s;e them; all I have to &s;ay, is, that it is now too late for a retreat to &s;atisfy them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, Sir, and far too true! yet is it always be&s;t to do right, however tardily; al|ways better to repent, than to grow callous in wrong."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Suffer not, however, your delicacy for my family to make you forget what is due to your&s;elf as well as to me: the fear of &s;hock|ing you led me ju&s;t now to conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention. The honour I have had in view is already known to many, and in a very &s;hort time there are none will be ignorant of it. That impu|dent
<PB N="162" REF="161">
young man, Morrice, had the effron|tery to rally me upon my pa&s;&s;ion for you, and though I reproved him with great a&s;pe|rity, he followed me into a coffee-hou&s;e, whither I went merely to avoid him. There I forced my&s;elf to &s;tay, till I &s;aw him en|gaged with a news-paper, and then, through various private &s;treets and alleys, I returned hither; but judge my indignation, when the moment I knocked at the door, I per|ceived him again at my &s;ide!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did he, then, &s;ee you come in?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I angrily demanded what he meant by thus pur&s;uing me; he very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively begged my pardon, and &s;aid he had had a notion I &s;hould come back, and had there|fore only followed me to &s;ee if he was right! I he&s;itated for an in&s;tant whether to cha&s;ti&s;e, or confide in him, but believing a few hours would make his impertinence immaterial, I did neither,&mdash;the door opened, and I came in."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt; but Cecilia was too much &s;hocked to an&s;wer him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"weigh your objections again&s;t the con&s;equences which mu&s;t follow. It is di&s;covered I attended you in town; it will be pre&s;umed I had your permi&s;&s;ion for &s;uch attendance: to &s;e|parate, therefore, now, will be to no pur|po&s;e with re&s;pect to that delicacy which
<PB N="163" REF="162">
makes you wi&s;h it. It will be food for con|jecture, for enquiry, for wonder, almo&s;t while both our names are remembered, and while to me it will bring the keene&s;t mi&s;ery in the &s;everity of my di&s;appointment, it will ca&s;t over your own conduct a veil of my&s;tery and ob&s;curity wholly &s;ubver&s;ive of that un|clouded openne&s;s, that fair, tran&s;parent in|genuou&s;ne&s;s, by which it has hitherto been di&s;tingui&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, then,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"how dread|fully have I erred, that whatever path I now take mu&s;t lead me wrong!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You overwhelm me with grief,"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"by finding you thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, when I had hoped&mdash;Oh cruel Cecilia! how different to this did I hope to have met you!&mdash;all your doubts &s;ettled, all your fears removed, your mind perfectly compo&s;ed, and ready, unreluctantly, to ratify the pro|mi&s;e with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s accorded me!&mdash;where now are tho&s;e hopes!&mdash;where now&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why will you not begone?"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, unea&s;ily, <Q REND="inline">"indeed it is too late to &s;tay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell me fir&s;t,"</Q> cried he, with great energy, <Q REND="inline">"and let good Mrs. Charlton &s;peak too,&mdash;ought not every objection to our union, however potent, to give way, without further he&s;itation, to the certainty
<PB N="164" REF="163">
that our intending it mu&s;t become public? Who that hears of our meeting in London, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and at &s;uch hours,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why,"</Q> cried Cecilia, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"do you mention them, and yet &s;tay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;peak now,"</Q> an&s;wered he with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"or lo&s;e for-ever all that is dear to me, and add to the mi&s;ery of that lo&s;s, the heart-piercing reflection of having in|jured her whom of all the world I mo&s;t love, mo&s;t value, and mo&s;t revere!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how injured?"</Q> cried Cecilia, half alarmed and half di&s;plea&s;ed: <Q REND="inline">"Surely I mu&s;t &s;trangely have lived to fear now the voice of calumny?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If any one has ever,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o lived as to dare defy it, Mi&s;s Beverley is &s;he: but though &s;afe by the e&s;tabli&s;hed pu|rity of your character from calumny, there are other, and &s;carce le&s;s invidious attacks, from which no one is exempt, and of which the refinement, the &s;en&s;ibility of your mind, will render you but the more &s;u&s;ceptible: ridicule has &s;hafts, and impertinence has arrows, which though again&s;t innocence they may be levelled in vain, have always the power of wounding tranquility."</Q></P>
<P>Struck with a truth which &s;he could not controvert, Cecilia &s;ighed deeply, but &s;poke not.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="164">
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile is right;"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Charlton, <Q REND="inline">"and though your plan, my dear Cecilia, was certainly virtuous and proper, when you &s;et out from Bury, the purpo&s;e of your journey mu&s;t now be made &s;o public, that it will no longer be judicious nor rational."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile poured forth his warme&s;t thanks for this friendly interpo&s;ition, and then, &s;trengthened by &s;uch an advocate, re-urged all his arguments with redoubled hope and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;turbed, uncertain, comfortle&s;s, could frame her mind to no re&s;olution; &s;he walked about the room, deliberated,&mdash;de|termined,&mdash;wavered and deliberated again. Delvile then grew more urgent, and repre|&s;ented &s;o &s;trongly the various mortifications which mu&s;t follow &s;o tardy a renunciation of their intentions, that, terrified and per|plexed, and fearing the breach of their union would now be more injurious to her than its ratification, &s;he cea&s;ed all oppo&s;i|tion to his arguments, and uttered no words but of &s;olicitation that he would leave her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I will begone this very moment. Tell me but fir&s;t you will think of what I have &s;aid, and refer me not to your letter, but deign your&s;elf to pro|nounce my doom, when you have con&s;i|dered if it may not be &s;oftened."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="165">
To this &s;he tacitly con&s;ented; and elated with fre&s;h ri&s;ing hope, he recommended his cau&s;e to the patronage of Mrs. Charlton, and then, taking leave of Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I go,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"though I have yet a thou&s;and things to propo&s;e and to &s;upplicate, and though &s;till in a &s;u&s;pen&s;e that my temper knows ill how to endure; but I &s;hould rather be ren|dered mi&s;erable than happy, in merely over|powering your rea&s;on by entreaty. I leave you, therefore, to your own reflections; yet remember,&mdash;and refu&s;e not to remember with &s;ome compunction, that all chance, all po&s;&s;ibility of earthly happine&s;s for <HI>me</HI> de|pends upon your deci&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>He then tore him&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;hocked at the fatigue &s;he had occa&s;ioned her good old friend, now com|pelled her to go to re&s;t, and dedicated the remaining part of the night to uninter|rupted deliberation.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed once more in her power to be mi&s;tre&s;s of her de&s;tiny; but the very liberty of choice &s;he had &s;o much coveted, now at|tained appeared the mo&s;t heavy of calami|ties; &s;ince, uncertain even what &s;he ought to do, &s;he rather wi&s;hed to be drawn than to lead, rather de&s;ired to be guided than to guide. She was to be re&s;pon&s;ible not only to the world but to her&s;elf for the whole of this momentous tran&s;action, and the terror
<PB N="167" REF="166">
of leaving either di&s;&s;atisfied, made indepen|dence burthen&s;ome, and unlimited power a grievance.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s or mi&s;ery which awaited her re&s;olution were but &s;econdary con&s;ider|ations in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her mind; her con&s;ent to a clande&s;tine action &s;he lamented as an eternal blot to her character, and the undoubted publication of that con&s;ent as equally injurious to her fame. Neither re|tracting nor fulfilling her engagement could now retrieve what was pa&s;t, and in the bit|terne&s;s of regret for the error &s;he had com|mitted, &s;he thought happine&s;s unattainable for the remainder of her life.</P>
<P>In this gloomy de&s;pondence pa&s;&s;ed the night, her eyes never clo&s;ed, her determi|nation never formed. Morning, however, came, and upon &s;omething to fix was in|de&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>She now, therefore, finally employed her&s;elf in briefly comparing the good with the evil of giving Delvile wholly up, or becoming his for-ever.</P>
<P>In accepting him, &s;he was expo&s;ed to all the di&s;plea&s;ure of his relations, and, which affected her mo&s;t, to the indignant &s;everity of his mother: but not another ob&s;tacle could be found that &s;eemed of any weight to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>In refu&s;ing him &s;he was liable to the de|ri&s;ion

of the world, to &s;neers from &s;trangers, and remon&s;trances from her friends, to be|coming a topic for ridicule, if not for &s;lan|der, and an object of curio&s;ity if not of con|tempt.</P>
<P>The ills, therefore, that threatened her marriage, though mo&s;t afflicting, were lea&s;t di&s;graceful, and tho&s;e which awaited its breach, if le&s;s &s;erious, were more mortifying.</P>
<P>At length, after weighing every circum|&s;tance as well as her perturbed &s;pirits would permit, &s;he concluded that &s;o late to reject him mu&s;t bring mi&s;ery without any allevia|tion, while accepting him, though followed by wrath and reproach, left &s;ome opening for future hope, and &s;ome pro&s;pect of better days.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. AN EVENT.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE le&s;s unhappy in her deci&s;ion than in her uncertainty, and every way di&s;&s;atisfied with her &s;ituation, her views and her&s;elf, Cecilia was &s;till &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and uncomfortable, when Delvile called the next morning, that he could not di&s;|cover what her determination had been, and fearfully enquired his doom with hardly any hope of finding favour</P>
<P>But Cecilia was above affectation, and a &s;tranger to art. <Q REND="inline">"I would not, Sir,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"keep you an in&s;tant in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when I am no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e my&s;elf. I may have appeared trifling, but I have been nothing le&s;s, and you would readily exculpate me of caprice, if half the di&s;tre&s;s of my irre|&s;olution was known to you. Even now, when I he&s;itate no more, my mind is &s;o ill at ea&s;e, that I could neither wonder nor be di&s;plea&s;ed &s;hould you he&s;itate in your turn."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You he&s;itate no more?"</Q> cried he, al|mo&s;t breathle&s;s at the &s;ound of tho&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"and is it po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Oh my Cecilia!&mdash;
<PB N="170" REF="169">
is it po&s;&s;ible your re&s;olution is in my fa|vour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"how little is your rea&s;on to rejoice! a dejected and melan|choly gift is all you can receive!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ere I take it, then,"</Q> cried he, in a voice that &s;poke joy, pain, and fear all at once in commotion, <Q REND="inline">"tell me if your re|luctance has its origin in <HI>me,</HI> that I may rather even yet relinqui&s;h you, than merely owe your hand to the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of per&s;ecu|tion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your pride,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, half &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"has &s;ome right to be alarmed, though I meant not to alarm it. No! it is with my|&s;elf only I am at variance, with my own weakne&s;s and want of judgement that I quarrel,&mdash;in <HI>you</HI> I have all the reliance that the highe&s;t opinion of your honour and integrity can give me."</Q></P>
<P>This was enough for the warm heart of Delvile, not only to re&s;tore peace, but to awaken rapture. He was almo&s;t as wild with delight, as he had before been with ap|prehen&s;ion, and poured forth his acknow|ledgements with &s;o much fervour of grati|tude, that Cecilia imperceptibly grew re|conciled to her&s;elf, and before &s;he mi&s;&s;ed her dejection, participated in his content|ment.</P>
<P>She quitted him as &s;oon as &s;he had
<PB N="171" REF="170">
power, to acquaint Mrs. Charlton with what had pa&s;&s;ed, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in preparing her to accompany them to the altar; while Delvile flew to his new acquaintance, Mr. Singleton, the lawyer, to reque&s;t him to &s;upply the place of Mr. Monckton in giv|ing her away.</P>
<P>All was now ha&s;tened with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition, and to avoid ob&s;ervation, they agreed to meet at the church; their de&s;ire of &s;ecre&s;y, however potent, never urging them to wi&s;h the ceremony &s;hould be per|formed in a place le&s;s awful.</P>
<P>When the chairs, however, came, which were to carry the two ladies thither, Cecilia trembled and hung back. The greatne&s;s of her undertaking, the hazard of all her fu|ture happine&s;s, the di&s;graceful &s;ecre&s;y of her conduct, the expected reproaches of Mrs. Delvile, and the boldne&s;s and indelicacy of the &s;tep &s;he was about to take, all &s;o forc|ibly &s;truck, and &s;o painfully wounded her, that the moment &s;he was &s;ummoned to &s;et out, &s;he again lo&s;t her re&s;olution, and re|gretting the hour that ever Delvile was known to her, &s;he &s;unk into a chair, and gave up her whole &s;oul to angui&s;h and &s;or|row.</P>
<P>The good Mrs. Charlton tried in vain to con&s;ole her; a &s;udden horror again&s;t her&s;elf had now &s;eized her &s;pirits, which, ex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="172" REF="171">
by long &s;truggles, could rally no more.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he was at length &s;ur|pri&s;ed by Delvile, who&s;e unea&s;y a&s;toni&s;h|ment that &s;he had failed in her appointment, was only to be equalled by that with which he was &s;truck at the &s;ight of her tears. He demanded the cau&s;e with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s and apprehen&s;ion; Cecilia for &s;ome time could not &s;peak, and then, with a deep &s;igh <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile! how weak are we all when un&s;upported by our own e&s;teem! how feeble, how incon|&s;i&s;tent, how changeable, when our courage has any foundation but duty!"</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, much relieved by finding her &s;adne&s;s fprung not from any new affliction, gently reproached her breach of promi&s;e, and earne&s;tly entreated her to repair it. <Q REND="inline">"The clergyman,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"is waiting; I have left him with Mr. Singleton in the ve&s;try; no new objections have &s;tarted, and no new ob&s;tacles have intervened; why, then, torment our&s;elves with di&s;cu&s;&s;ing again the old ones, which we have already con&s;idered till every po&s;&s;ible argument upon them is exhau&s;ted? Tranquilize, I conjure you, your agitated &s;pirits, and if the true&s;t tenderne&s;s, the mo&s;t animated e&s;teem, and the grate|fulle&s;t admiration, can &s;often your future cares, and en&s;ure your future peace, every
<PB N="173" REF="172">
anniver&s;ary of this day will recompen&s;e my Cecilia for every pang &s;he now &s;uffers!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, half &s;oothed and half a&s;hamed, finding &s;he had in fact nothing new to &s;ay or to object, compelled her&s;elf to ri&s;e, and; penetrated by his &s;olicitations, endeavoured to compo&s;e her mind, and promi&s;ed to fol|low him.</P>
<P>He would not tru&s;t her, however, from his &s;ight, but &s;eizing the very in&s;tant of her renewed con&s;ent, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the chairs, and ordering a hackney-coach, preferred any ri&s;k to that of her again wavering, and in&s;i&s;ted upon accompanying her in it him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia had now &s;carce time to breathe, before &s;he found her&s;elf at the porch of &mdash; church. Delvile hurried her out of the car|riage, and then offered his arm to Mrs. Charlton. Not a word was &s;poken by any of the party till they went into the ve&s;try, where Delvile ordered Cecilia a gla&s;s of water, and having ha&s;tily made his compli|ments to the clergyman, gave her hand to Mr. Singleton, who led her to the altar.</P>
<P>The ceremony was now begun; and Ce|cilia, finding her&s;elf pa&s;t all power of re|tracting, &s;oon called her thoughts from wi&s;hing it, and turned her whole attention to the awful &s;ervice; to which though &s;he li&s;tened with reverence, her full &s;atisfaction
<PB N="174" REF="173">
in the object of her vows, made her li&s;ten without terror. But when the prie&s;t came to that &s;olemn adjuration, <HI>If any man can &s;hew any ju&s;t cau&s;e why they may not lawfully be joined together,</HI> a con&s;cious tear &s;tole into her eye, and a &s;igh e&s;caped from Delvile that went to her heart: but, when the prie&s;t concluded the exhortation with <HI>let him now &s;peak, or el&s;e hereafter for-ever hold his peace,</HI> a female voice at &s;ome di&s;tance, called out in &s;hrill accents, <Q REND="inline">"I do!"</Q></P>
<P>The ceremony was in&s;tantly &s;topt. The a&s;toni&s;hed prie&s;t immediately &s;hut up the book to regard the intended bride and bride|groom; Delvile &s;tarted with amazement to &s;ee whence the &s;ound proceeded; and Ceci|lia, agha&s;t, and &s;truck with horror, faintly &s;hriekt, and caught hold of Mrs. Charl|ton.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation was general, and general was the &s;ilence, though all of one ac|cord turned round towards the place whence the voice i&s;&s;ued: a female form at the &s;ame moment was &s;een ru&s;hing from a pew, who glided out of the church with the quickne&s;s of lightning.</P>
<P>Not a word was yet uttered, every one &s;eeming rooted to the &s;pot on which he &s;tood, and regarding in mute wonder the place this form had cro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="174">
Delvile at length exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What can this mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you not know the woman, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid the clergyman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I did not even &s;ee her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor you, madam?"</Q> &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, in a voice that &s;carce articulated the two &s;yllables, and changing colour &s;o frequently, that Del|vile, apprehen&s;ive &s;he would faint, flew to her, calling out <Q REND="inline">"Let <HI>me</HI> &s;upport you!"</Q></P>
<P>She turned from him ha&s;tily, and &s;till holding by Mrs. Charlton, moved away from the altar.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whither,"</Q> cried Delvile, fearfully fol|lowing her, <Q REND="inline">whither are you going?"</Q></P>
<P>She made not any an&s;wer; but &s;till, though tottering as much from emotion as Mrs. Charlton from infirmity, &s;he walked on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why did you &s;top the ceremony, Sir?"</Q> cried Delvile, impatiently &s;peaking to the clergyman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No ceremony, Sir,"</Q> he returned, <Q REND="inline">"could proceed with &s;uch an interrup|tion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It has been wholly accidental,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for we neither of us know the wo|man, who could not have any right or au|thority for the prohibition."</Q> Then yet
<PB N="176" REF="175">
more anxiou&s;ly pur&s;uing Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"why,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"do you thus move off?&mdash;Why leave the ceremony unfini&s;hed?&mdash;Mrs. Charlton, what is it you are about?&mdash;Cecilia, I be&s;eech you return, and let the &s;ervice go on!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, making a motion with her hand to forbid his following her, &s;till &s;ilently pro|ceeded, though drawing along with equal difficulty Mrs. Charlton and her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is in&s;upportable!"</Q> cried Delvile, with vehemence, <Q REND="inline">"turn, I conjure you!&mdash;my Cecilia!&mdash;my wife!&mdash;why is it you thus abandon me?&mdash;Turn, I implore you, and receive my eternal vows!&mdash;Mrs. Charlton, bring her back,&mdash;Cecilia, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not go!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He now attempted to take her hand, but &s;hrinking from his touch, in an emphatic but low voice, &s;he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I mu&s;t!&mdash;an interdiction &s;uch as this!&mdash;for the world could I not brave it!"</Q></P>
<P>She then made an effort to &s;omewhat quicken her pace.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> cried Delvile, half frantic, <Q REND="inline">"where is this infamous woman? This wretch who has thus wantonly de&s;troyed me!"</Q></P>
<P>And he ru&s;hed out of the church in pur|&s;uit of her.</P>
<P>The clergyman and Mr. Singleton, who
<PB N="177" REF="176">
had hitherto been wondering &s;pectators, came now to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Cecilia. She declined any help for her&s;elf, but gladly accepted their &s;ervices for Mrs. Charlton, who, thunder&s;truck by all that had pa&s;t, &s;eemed almo&s;t robbed of her fa|culties. Mr. Singleton propo&s;ed calling a hackney coach, &s;he con&s;ented, and they &s;topt for it at the church porch.</P>
<P>The clergyman now began to enquire of the pew-opener, what &s;he knew of the wo|man, who &s;he was, and how &s;he had got into the church? She knew of her, &s;he an|&s;wered, nothing, but that &s;he had come in to early prayers, and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had hid her&s;elf in a pew when they were over, as &s;he had thought the church entirely empty.</P>
<P>An hackney coach now drew up, and while the gentlemen were a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mrs. Charlton into it, Delvile returned.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have pur&s;ued and enquired,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"in vain, I can neither di&s;cover nor hear of her.&mdash;But what is all this? Whither are you going?&mdash;What does this coach do here?&mdash;Mrs. Charlton, why do you get into it?&mdash;Cecilia, what are you doing?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia turned away from him in &s;ilence. The &s;hock &s;he had received, took from her all power of &s;peech, while amazement and terror deprived her even of relief from tears. She believed Delvile to blame,
<PB N="178" REF="177">
though &s;he knew not in what, but the ob|&s;curity of her fears &s;erved only to render them more dreadful.</P>
<P>She was now getting into the coach her|&s;elf, but Delvile, who could neither brook her di&s;plea&s;ure, nor endure her departure, forcibly caught her hand, and called out <Q REND="inline">"You are <HI>mine,</HI> you are my <HI>wife!</HI>&mdash;I will part with you no more, and go whither&s;oever you will, I will follow and claim you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stop me not!"</Q> cried &s;he, impatiently though faintly, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ick, I am ill al|ready,&mdash;if you detain me any longer, I &s;hall be unable to &s;upport my&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh then re&s;t on <HI>me!</HI>"</Q> cried he, &s;till holding her; <Q REND="inline">"re&s;t but upon me till the ceremony is over!&mdash;you will drive me to de&s;pair and to madne&s;s if you leave me in this barbarous manner!"</Q></P>
<P>A crowd now began to gather, and the words bride and bridegroom reached the ears of Cecilia; who half dead with &s;hame, with fear, and with di&s;tre&s;s, ha&s;tily &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"You are determined to make me mi&s;er|able!"</Q> and &s;natching away her hand, which Delvile at tho&s;e words could no longer hold, &s;he threw her&s;elf into the carriage.</P>
<P>Delvile, however, jumped in after her, and with an air of authority ordered the coachman to Pall-Mall, and then drew up
<PB N="179" REF="178">
the gla&s;&s;es, with a look of fiercene&s;s at the mob.</P>
<P>Cecilia had neither &s;pirits nor power to re&s;i&s;t him; yet, offended by his violence, and &s;hocked to be thus publickly pur&s;ued by him, her looks &s;poke a re&s;entment far more mortifying than any verbal reproach.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Inhuman Cecilia!"</Q> cried he, pa&s;&s;ion|ately, <Q REND="inline">"to de&s;ert me at the very altar!&mdash;to ca&s;t me off at the in&s;tant the mo&s;t &s;acred rites were uniting us!&mdash;and then thus to look at me!&mdash;to treat me with this di&s;dain at a time of &s;uch di&s;traction!&mdash;to &s;corn me thus injuriou&s;ly at the moment you unju&s;tly abandon me!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To how dreadful a &s;cene,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, recovering from her con&s;ternation, <Q REND="inline">"have you expo&s;ed me! to what &s;hame, what indignity, what irreparable di&s;grace!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh heaven!"</Q> cried he with horror, <Q REND="inline">"if any crime, any offence of mine has occa&s;ioned this fatal blow, the whole world holds not a wretch &s;o culpable as my&s;elf, nor one who will &s;ooner allow the ju&s;tice of your rigour! my veneration for you has ever equalled my affection, and could I think it was through <HI>me</HI> you have &s;uffered any indignity, I &s;hould &s;oon abhor my&s;elf as you &s;eem to abhor me. But what is it I have done? How have I thus incen&s;ed you?
<PB N="180" REF="179">
By what action, by what guilt, have I in|curred this di&s;plea&s;ure?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whence,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"came that voice which &s;till vibrates in my ear? The prohibition could not be on <HI>my</HI> account, &s;ince none to whom I am known have either right or intere&s;t in even wi&s;hing it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What an inference is this! over <HI>me,</HI> then, do you conclude this woman had any power?"</Q></P>
<P>Here they &s;topt at the lodgings. Del|vile handed both the ladies out. Cecilia, eager to avoid his importunities, and dread|fully di&s;turbed, ha&s;tily pa&s;t him, and ran up &s;tairs; but Mrs. Charlton refu&s;ed not his arm, on which &s;he lent till they reached the drawing-room.</P>
<P>Cecilia then rang the bell for her &s;ervant, and gave orders that a po&s;t-chai&s;e might be &s;ent for immediately.</P>
<P>Delvile now felt offended in his turn; but &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his vehemence, he gravely and quietly &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Determined as you are to leave me, indifferent to my peace, and in|credulous of my word, deign, at lea&s;t, be|fore we part, to be more explicit in your accu&s;ation, and tell me if indeed it is po&s;|&s;ible you can &s;u&s;pect that the wretch who broke off the ceremony, had ever from me received provocation for &s;uch an action?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not what to &s;u&s;pect,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia,
<PB N="181" REF="180">
<Q REND="inline">"where every thing is thus involved in ob&s;curity; but I mu&s;t own I &s;hould have &s;ome difficulty to think tho&s;e words the ef|fect of chance, or to credit that their &s;peaker was concealed without de&s;ign."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are right, then, madam,"</Q> cried he, re&s;entfully, <Q REND="inline">"to di&s;card me! to treat me with contempt, to bani&s;h me without repugnance, &s;ince I &s;ee you believe me ca|pable of duplicity, and imagine I am bet|ter informed in this affair than I appear to be. You have &s;aid I &s;hall make you mi&s;er|able,&mdash;no, madam, no! your happine&s;s and mi&s;ery depend not upon one you hold &s;o worthle&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On whatever they depend,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"I am too little at ea&s;e for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I would no more be daring than &s;uper&s;ti|tious, but none of our proceedings have pro&s;pered, and &s;ince their privacy has al|ways been contrary both to my judgment and my principles, I know not how to repine at a failure I cannot think unmerited. Mrs. Charlton, our chai&s;e is coming; you will be ready, I hope, to &s;et off in it directly?"</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, too angry to tru&s;t him&s;elf to &s;peak, now walked about the room, and en|deavoured to calm him&s;elf; but &s;o little was his &s;ucce&s;s, that though &s;ilent till the chai&s;e was announced, when he heard that dreaded &s;ound, and &s;aw Cecilia &s;teady in her pur|po&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="181">
of departing, he was &s;o much &s;hocked and afflicted, that, cla&s;ping his hands in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion and grief, he exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"This, then, Cecilia, is your faith! this is the felicity you bid me hope! this is the recompen&s;e of my &s;ufferings, and the per|formance of your engagement!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;truck by the&s;e reproaches, turned back; but while &s;he he&s;itated how to an&s;wer them, he went on. <Q REND="inline">"You are in&s;en&s;ible to my mi&s;ery, and impenetrable to my entreaties; a &s;ecret enemy has had power to make me odious in your &s;ight, though for her enmity I can a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e, though even her exi&s;tence was this morning unknown to me! Ever ready to abandon, and mo&s;t willing to condemn me, you have more confidence in a vague conjecture, than in all you have ob&s;erved of the whole tenour of my character. Without know|ing why, you are di&s;po&s;ed to believe me criminal, without deigning to &s;ay where|fore, you are eager to bani&s;h me your pre|&s;ence. Yet &s;carce could a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt it&s;elf, wound me &s;o forcibly, &s;o keenly, as your &s;u&s;pecting I am guilty!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Again, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall I &s;ubject my&s;elf to a &s;cene of &s;uch di&s;grace and horror? No, never!&mdash;The puni&s;h|ment of my error &s;hall at lea&s;t &s;ecure its re|formation. Yet if I merit your reproaches,
<PB N="183" REF="182">
I de&s;erve not your regard; cea&s;e, therefore, to profe&s;s any for me, or make them no more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shew but to them,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;malle&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, &s;hew but for me the mo&s;t di&s;tant concern, and I will try to bear my di&s;appointment without murmuring, and &s;ubmit to your decrees as to tho&s;e from which there is no appeal: but to wound without deigning even to look at what you de&s;troy,&mdash;to &s;hoot at random tho&s;e arrows that are pointed with poi&s;on,&mdash;to &s;ee them fa&s;ten on the heart, and corrode its vital functions, yet look on without compunc|tion, or turn away with cold di&s;dain,&mdash;Oh where is the candour I thought lodged in Cecilia! where the ju&s;tice, the equity, I believed a part of her&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"After all that has pa&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;en&s;ibly touched by his di&s;tre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I ex|pected not the&s;e complaints, nor that, from me, any a&s;&s;urances would be wanted; yet, if it will quiet your mind, if it will better reconcile you to our &s;eparation&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh fatal prelude!"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"what on earth can quiet my mind that leads to our &s;eparation?&mdash;Give to me no conde&s;cen&s;ion with any &s;uch view,&mdash;pre|&s;erve your indifference, per&s;evere in your coldne&s;s, triumph &s;till in your power of in|&s;piring tho&s;e feelings you can never return,

<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet how,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"parted, torn a&s;under as we have been, how is it now to be avoided?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tru&s;t in my honour! Shew me but the confidence which I will venture to &s;ay I de|&s;erve, and then will that union no longer be impeded, which in future, I am certain, will never be repented!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, what a reque&s;t! faith &s;o implicity would be frenzy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You doubt, then, my integrity? You &s;u&s;pect&mdash;"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"You give me, then, up?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be patient, I be&s;eech you; and at|tempt not to follow me; tis a &s;tep I cannot permit."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not follow you? And who has power to prevent me?"</Q></P>

<P>She then, with an air of determined &s;tea|dine&s;s, moved on; Mrs. Charlton, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ervants, being already upon the &s;tairs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O tyranny!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is it you exact!&mdash;May I not even enquire into the dreadful my&s;tery of this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, certainly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And may I not acquaint you with it, &s;hould it be di&s;covered?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not be &s;orry to hear it. Adieu."</Q></P>
<P>She was now half way down the &s;tairs; when, lo&s;ing all forbearance, he ha&s;tily flew after her, and endeavouring to &s;top her, called out, <Q REND="inline">"If you do not hate and dete&s;t me,&mdash;if I am not loath&s;ome and ab|horrent to you, O quit me not thus in&s;en|&s;ibly!&mdash;Cecilia! my beloved Cecilia!&mdash;&s;peak to me, at lea&s;t, one word of le&s;s &s;e|verity! Look at me once more, and tell me we part not for-ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then turned round, and while a &s;tarting tear &s;hewed her &s;ympathetic di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why will you thus oppre&s;s me with entreaties I ought not to gratify?&mdash;Have I not accompanied you to the altar,&mdash;and can you doubt what I have thought of you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Have</HI> thought?&mdash;Oh Cecilia!&mdash;is it then all over?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="185">
<Q REND="inline">"Pray &s;uffer me to go quietly, and fear not I &s;hall go too happily! Suppre&s;s your own feelings, rather than &s;eek to awaken mine.

<P>She then hurried to the chai&s;e, Del|vile pur&s;uing her with thanks and ble&s;&s;ings, and gratefully a&s;&s;uring her, as he handed her into it, that he would obey all her injunc|tions, and not even attempt to &s;ee her, till he could bring her &s;ome intelligence con|cerning the morning's tran&s;action.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A CONSTERNATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE journey was melancholy and te|dious: Mrs. Charlton, extremely fa|tigued by the unu&s;ual hurry and exerci&s;e both of mind and body which &s;he had lately gone through, was obliged to travel very &s;lowly, and to lie upon the road. Ce|cilia, however, was in no ha&s;te to proceed: &s;he was going to no one &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee, &s;he was wholly without expectation of meeting with any thing that could give her plea&s;ure. The unfortunate expedition in which &s;he had been engaged, left her now nothing but regret, and only promi&s;ed her in future &s;orrow and mortification.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, after her return home, &s;till continued ill, and Cecilia, who con|&s;tantly attended her, had the additional af|fliction of imputing her indi&s;po&s;ition to her&s;elf. Every thing &s;he thought con&s;pired to puni&s;h the error &s;he had committed; her proceedings were di&s;covered, though her motives were unknown; the Delvile family could not fail to hear of her enterprize, and while they attributed it to her teme|rity,
<PB N="188" REF="187">
they would exult in its failure: but chiefly hung upon her mind the unac|countable prohibition of her marriage. Whence that could proceed &s;he was wholly without ability to divine, yet her &s;urmizes were not more fruitle&s;s than various. At one moment &s;he imagined it &s;ome frolic of Morrice, at another &s;ome perfidy of Monckton, and at another an idle and unmeaning trick of &s;ome &s;tranger to them all. But none of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions carried with them any air of probability; Morrice, even if he had watched their motions and pur&s;ued them to the church, which his in|qui&s;itive impertinence made by no means impo&s;&s;ible, could yet hardly have had either time or opportunity to engage any woman in &s;o extraordinary an undertaking; Mr. Monckton, however aver&s;e to the connec|tion, &s;he con&s;idered as a man of too much honour to break it off in a manner &s;o alarm|ing and di&s;graceful; and mi&s;chief &s;o wan|ton in any &s;tranger, &s;eemed to require a &s;hare of unfeeling effrontery, which could fall to the lot of &s;o few as to make this &s;ug|ge&s;tion unnatural and incredible.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he imagined that Delvile might formerly have been affianced to &s;ome woman, who, having accidentally di&s;covered his intentions, took this de&s;perate method of rendering them abortive: but this was a
<PB N="189" REF="188">
&s;hort-lived thought, and &s;peedily gave way to her e&s;teem for his general character, and her confidence in the firmne&s;s of his probity.</P>
<P>All, therefore, was dark and my&s;terious; conjecture was baffled, and meditation was u&s;ele&s;s. Her opinions were unfixed, and her heart was mi&s;erable; &s;he could only be &s;teady in believing Delvile as unhappy as her&s;elf, and only find con&s;olation in believ|ing him, al&s;o, as blamele&s;s.</P>
<P>Three days pa&s;&s;ed thus, without incident or intelligence; her time wholly occupied in attending Mrs. Charlton; her thoughts all engro&s;&s;ed upon her own &s;ituation: but upon the fourth day &s;he was informed that a lady was in the parlour, who de&s;ired to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>She pre&s;ently went down &s;tairs,&mdash;and, upon entering the room, perceived Mrs. Delvile!</P>
<P>Seized with a&s;toni&s;hment and fear, &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, and, looking agha&s;t, held by the door, robbed of all power to receive &s;o unexpected and unwelcome a vi&s;itor, by an internal &s;en&s;ation of guilt, mingled with a dread of di&s;covery and reproach.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, addre&s;&s;ing her with the colde&s;t politene&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I fear I have &s;urpri&s;ed you; I am &s;orry I had not time
<PB N="190" REF="189">
to acquaint you of my intention to wait upon you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, moving from the door, faintly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot, madam, but be honoured by your notice, whenever you are plea&s;ed to confer it."</Q></P>
<P>They then &s;at down; Mrs. Delvile pre|&s;erving an air the mo&s;t formal and di&s;tant, and Cecilia half &s;inking with apprehen&s;ive di&s;may.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort and ill-boding &s;ilence, <Q REND="inline">"I mean not,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"to em|barra&s;s or di&s;tre&s;s you; I will not, there|fore, keep you in &s;u&s;pen&s;e of the purport of my vi&s;it. I come not to make enquiries, I come not to put your &s;incerity to any trial, nor to torture your delicacy; I di&s;|pen&s;e with all explanation, for I have not one doubt to &s;olve: I <HI>know</HI> what has pa&s;&s;ed, I <HI>know</HI> that my &s;on loves you."</Q></P>
<P>Not all her &s;ecret alarm, nor all the perturbation of her fears, had taught Ce|cilia to expect &s;o direct an attack, nor enabled her to bear the &s;hock of it with any compo&s;ure: &s;he could not &s;peak, &s;he could not look at Mrs. Delvile; &s;he aro&s;e, and walked to the window, without know|ing what &s;he was doing.</P>
<P>Here, however, her di&s;tre&s;s was not likely to dimini&s;h; for the fir&s;t &s;ight &s;he &s;aw was
<PB N="191" REF="190">
Fidel, who barked, and jumped up at the window to lick her hands.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! Fidel here!"</Q> exclaimed Mrs. Delvile, amazed.</P>
<P>Cecilia, totally overpowered, covered her glowing face with both her hands, and &s;unk into a chair.</P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile for a few minutes was &s;ilent; and then, following her, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Imagine not I am making any di&s;covery, nor &s;u&s;pect me of any de&s;ign to develop your &s;enti|ments. That Mortimer could love in vain I never believed; that Mi&s;s Beverley, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o much merit, could be blind to it in another, I never thought po&s;&s;ible. I mean not, therefore, to &s;olicit any account or explanation, but merely to beg your patience while I talk to you my&s;elf, and your permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to you with open|ne&s;s and truth."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though relieved by this calm|ne&s;s from all apprehen&s;ion of reproach, found in her manner a coldne&s;s that con|vinced her of the lo&s;s of her affection, and in the introduction to her bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;olemnity that a&s;&s;ured her what &s;he &s;hould decree would be unalterable. She uncovered her face to &s;hew her re&s;pectful attention, but &s;he could not rai&s;e it up, and could not utter a word.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="191">
Mrs. Delvile then &s;eated her&s;elf next her, and gravely continued her di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, however little ac|quainted with the &s;tate of our family affairs, can &s;carcely have been uninformed that a fortune &s;uch as hers &s;eems almo&s;t all that family can de&s;ire; nor can &s;he have failed to ob&s;erve, that her merit and accompli&s;h|ments have no where been more felt and admired: the choice therefore of Mortimer &s;he could not doubt would have our &s;anc|tion, and when &s;he honoured his propo&s;als with her favour, &s;he might naturally con|clude &s;he gave happine&s;s and plea&s;ure to all his friends."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;uperior to accepting a palli|ation of which &s;he &s;elt her&s;elf unde&s;erving, now lifted up her head, and forcing her&s;elf to &s;peak, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"No, madam, I will not deceive you, for I have never been deceived my&s;elf: I pre&s;umed not to expect your ap|probation,&mdash;though in mi&s;&s;ing it I have for ever lo&s;t my own!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has Mortimer, then,"</Q> cried &s;he with eagerne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"been &s;trictly honourable? has he neither beguiled nor betrayed you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing, <Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to reproach him with."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then he is indeed my &s;on!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, with emotion; <Q REND="inline">"had he been treacherous to you, while di&s;obedient to us, I had indi&s;putably renounced him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="192">
Cecilia, who now &s;eemed the only cul|prit, felt her&s;elf in a &s;tate of humiliation not to be borne; &s;he collected, therefore, all her courage, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have cleared Mr. Delvile; permit me, madam, now, to &s;ay &s;omething for my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly; you cannot oblige me more than by &s;peaking without di&s;gui&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not in the hope of regaining your good opinion,&mdash;that, I &s;ee, is lo&s;t!&mdash;but merely&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not lo&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"but if once it was yet higher, the fault was my own, in indulging an expectation of perfec|tion to which human nature is perhaps unequal."</Q></P>
<P>Ah, then, thought Cecilia, all is over! the contempt I &s;o much feared is incurred, and though it may be &s;oftened, it can never be removed!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak, then, and with &s;incerity,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"all you wi&s;h me to hear, and then grant me your attention in return to the purpo&s;e of my pre&s;ent journey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have little, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered the depre&s;&s;ed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ay; you tell me you already know all that has pa&s;t; I will not, therefore, pretend to take any merit from revealing it: I will only add, that my con&s;ent to this tran&s;action has made me mi&s;erable almo&s;t from the moment I gave
<PB N="194" REF="193">
it; that I meant and wi&s;hed to retract as &s;oon as reflection pointed out to me my error, and that circum&s;tances the mo&s;t per|ver&s;e, not blindne&s;s to propriety, nor &s;tub|bornne&s;s in wrong, led me to make, at la&s;t, that fatal attempt, of which the recollec|tion, to my la&s;t hour, mu&s;t fill me with regret and &s;hame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wonder not,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that in a &s;ituation where delicacy was &s;o much le&s;s requi&s;ite than courage, Mi&s;s Be|verley &s;hould feel her&s;elf di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and un|happy. A mind &s;uch as hers could never err with impunity; and it is &s;olely from a certainty of her innate &s;en&s;e of right, that I venture to wait upon her now, and that I have any hope to influence <HI>her</HI> upon who&s;e influence alone our whole family mu&s;t in future depend. Shall I now pro|ceed, or is there any thing you wi&s;h to &s;ay fir&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hear me, then, I beg of you, with no pre-determination to di&s;regard me, but with an equitable re&s;olution to attend to rea&s;on, and a candour that leaves an opening to conviction. Not ea&s;y, indeed, is &s;uch a ta&s;k, to a mind pre-occupied with an in|tention to be guided by the dictates of in|clination,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You wrong me, indeed, madam!"</Q> in|terrupted
<PB N="195" REF="194">
Cecilia, greatly hurt, <Q REND="inline">"my mind harbours no &s;uch intention, it has no de&s;ire but to be guided by duty, it is wretched with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having failed in it! I pine, I &s;icken to recover my own good opinion; I &s;hould then no longer feel un|worthy of yours; and whether or not I might be able to regain it, I &s;hould at lea&s;t lo&s;e this cruel depre&s;&s;ion that now &s;inks me in your pre&s;ence!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To regain it,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"were to exerci&s;e but half your power, which at this moment enables you, if &s;uch is your wi&s;h, to make me think of you more highly than one human being ever thought of another. Do you conde&s;cend to hold this worth your while?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;tarted at the que&s;tion; her heart beat quick with &s;truggling pa&s;&s;ions; &s;he &s;aw the &s;acrifice which was to be re|quired, and her pride, her affronted pride, aro&s;e high to anticipate the rejection; but the de&s;ign was combated by her affections, which oppo&s;ed the indignant ra&s;hne&s;s, and told her that one ha&s;ty &s;peech might &s;e|parate her from Delvile for ever. When this painful conflict was over, of which Mrs. Delvile patiently waited the i&s;&s;ue, &s;he an&s;wered, with much he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"To re|gain your good opinion, madam, greatly, truly as I value it,&mdash;is what I now &s;carcely dare hope."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="195">
<Q REND="inline">"Say not &s;o,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince, if you hope, you cannot mi&s;s it. I purpo&s;e to point out to you the means to recover it, and to tell you how greatly I &s;hall think my&s;elf your debtor if you refu&s;e not to employ them."</Q></P>
<P>She &s;topt; but Cecilia hung back; fear|ful of her own &s;trength, &s;he dared venture at no profe&s;&s;ions; yet, how either to &s;up|port, or di&s;pute her compliance, &s;he dreaded to think.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I come to you, then,"</Q> Mrs. Delvile &s;olemnly re&s;umed, <Q REND="inline">"in the name of Mr. Delvile, and in the name of our whole fa|mily; a family as ancient as it is honour|able, as honourable as it is ancient.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, the &s;upporter of our hou&s;e, the &s;ole guardian of its name, and the heir of our united fortunes, has &s;elected you, we know, for the lady of his choice, and &s;o fondly has fixed upon you his affections, that he is ready to relinqui&s;h us all in pre|ference to &s;ubduing them. To your&s;elf alone, then, can we apply, and I come to you&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O hold, madam, hold!"</Q> interrupted Cecilia, who&s;e courage now revived from re&s;entment, <Q REND="inline">"I know what you would &s;ay;
<PB N="197" REF="196">
you come to tell me of your di&s;dain; you come to reproach my pre&s;umption, and to kill me with your contempt! There is little occa&s;ion for &s;uch a &s;tep; I am de|pre&s;&s;ed, I am &s;elf-condemned already: &s;pare me, therefore, this in&s;upportable hu|miliation, wound me not with your &s;corn, oppre&s;s me not with your &s;uperiority! I aim at no competition, I attempt no vin|dication, I acknowledge my own littlene&s;s as readily as you can de&s;pi&s;e it, and nothing but indignity could urge me to defend it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Believe me,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I meant not to hurt or offend you, and I am &s;orry if I have appeared to you either ar|rogant or a&s;&s;uming. The peculiar and pe|rilous &s;ituation of my family has perhaps betrayed me into offen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions, and made me guilty my&s;elf of an o&s;tentation which in others has often di&s;gu&s;ted me. Ill, indeed, can we any of us bear the te&s;t of experiment, when tried upon tho&s;e &s;ub|jects which call forth our particular pro|pen&s;ities. We may &s;trive to be di&s;in|tere&s;ted, we may &s;truggle to be impartial, but &s;elf will &s;till predominate, &s;till &s;hew us the imperfection of our natures, and the narrowne&s;s of our &s;ouls. Yet acquit me, I beg, of any intentional in&s;olence, and imagine not that in &s;peaking highly of my own family, I mean to depreciate yours:
<PB N="198" REF="197">
on the contrary, I know it to be re&s;pec|table, I know, too, that were it the lowe&s;t in the kingdom, the fir&s;t might envy it that it gave birth to &s;uch a daughter."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;omewhat &s;oothed by this &s;peech, begged her pardon for having interrupted her, and &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To your family, then, I a&s;&s;ure you, whatever may be the pride of our own, <HI>you</HI> being its offspring, we would not object. With your merit we are all well acquainted, your character has our highe&s;t e&s;teem, and your fortune exceeds even our mo&s;t &s;an|guine de&s;ires. Strange at once and afflict|ing! that not all the&s;e requi&s;ites for the &s;atisfaction of prudence, nor all the&s;e al|lurements for the gratification of happine&s;s, can &s;uffice to fulfil or to &s;ilence the claims of either! There are yet other demands to which we mu&s;t attend, demands which ance&s;try and blood call upon us aloud to ratify! Such claimants are not to be neg|lected with impunity; they a&s;&s;ert their rights with the authority of pre&s;cription, they forbid us alike either to bend to in|clination, or &s;toop to intere&s;t, and from generation to generation their injuries will call out for redre&s;s, &s;hould their noble and long un&s;ullied name be voluntarily con|&s;igned to oblivion!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely &s;truck by the&s;e words,
<PB N="199" REF="198">
&s;carce wondered, &s;ince &s;o &s;trong and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed were her opinions, that the ob|&s;tacle to her marriage, though but one, &s;hould be con&s;idered as in&s;uperable.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not, therefore, to <HI>your</HI> name are we aver&s;e,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"but &s;imply to our own more partial.

<P>Cecilia, &s;carce more afflicted than of|fended, now ha&s;tily an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Not for me, madam, &s;hall he commit this crime, not on <HI>my</HI> account &s;hall he be reprobated by his family!

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobly &s;aid!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, her

<P>Cecilia now trembled and turned pale; &s;he &s;carce knew her&s;elf what &s;he had &s;aid, but, &s;he found by Mrs. Delvile's con&s;truc|tion of her words, they had been regarded as her final relinqui&s;hing of her &s;on.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I grieve, indeed,"</Q> continued Mrs. Delvile, who&s;e coldne&s;s and au&s;terity were changed into mildne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"at the nece&s;&s;ity I have been under to draw from you a concurrence &s;o painful: but no other re&s;ource was in my power.

<Q REND="inline">"I have nothing, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, coldly, <Q REND="inline">"to forgive; you have only a&s;&s;erted your own dignity, and I have no|body to blame but my&s;elf, for having given you occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"if worth and noblene&s;s of &s;oul on your part, if e&s;teem and tendere&s;t affection on mine, were all which that dignity which offends you re|quires, how &s;hould I crave the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch a daughter! how rejoice in joining my &s;on to excellence &s;o like his own, and en&s;uring his happine&s;s while I &s;timulated his virtue!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not talk to me of affection, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, turning away from her; <Q REND="inline">"whatever you had for me is pa&s;t,&mdash;even your e&s;teem is gone,&mdash;you may pity me, indeed, but your pity is mixed with contempt, and I am not &s;o abject as to find comfort from exciting it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O little,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, looking at her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"little do you &s;ee the &s;tate of my heart, for never have you appeared to me &s;o worthy as at this moment!

<P>She then moved towards the door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is your carriage, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia,
<PB N="202" REF="201">
&s;truggling to di&s;gui&s;e her inward angui&s;h under an appearance of &s;ullenne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"in waiting?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile then came back, and hold|ing out her hand, while her eyes gli&s;tened with tears, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To part from you thus frigidly, while my heart &s;o warmly admires you, is almo&s;t more than I can endure. Oh gentle&s;t Cecilia! condemn not a mother who is impelled to this &s;everity, who per|forming what &s;he holds to be her duty, thinks the office her bittere&s;t misfortune, who fore&s;ees in the rage of her hu&s;band, and the re&s;i&s;tance of her &s;on, all the mi&s;ery of dome&s;tic contention, and who can only &s;e|cure the honour of her family by de|&s;troying its peace!&mdash;You will not, then, give me your hand?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who had affected not to &s;ee that &s;he waited for it, now coldly put it out, di&s;tantly courte&s;ying, and &s;eeking to pre&s;erve her &s;teadine&s;s by avoiding to &s;peak. Mrs. Delvile took it, and as &s;he repeated her adieu, affectionately pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips; Cecilia, &s;tarting, and breathing &s;hort, from encrea&s;ing yet &s;mothered agitation, called out <Q REND="inline">"Why, why this conde&s;cen&s;ion?&mdash;pray,&mdash;I entreat you, madam!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven ble&s;s you, my love!"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, dropping a tear upon the hand &s;he &s;till held, <Q REND="inline">"heaven ble&s;s you,
<PB N="203" REF="202">

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried Cecilia, vainly &s;triving to repre&s;s any longer the tears which now forced their way down her cheeks, <Q REND="inline">"why will you break my heart with this kindne&s;s! why will you &s;till compel me to love,&mdash;when now I almo&s;t wi&s;h to hate you!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, hate me not,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, ki&s;&s;ing from her cheeks the tears that wa|tered them, <Q REND="inline">"hate me not, &s;weete&s;t Ce|cilia, though in wounding your gentle bo&s;om, I am almo&s;t dete&s;table to my&s;elf. Even the cruel &s;cene which awaits me with my &s;on will not more deeply afflict me. But adieu,&mdash;I mu&s;t now prepare for him!"</Q></P>
<P>She then left the room: but Cecilia, who&s;e pride had no power to re&s;i&s;t this tenderne&s;s, ran ha&s;tily after her, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Shall I not &s;ee you again, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall your&s;elf decide,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"if my coming will not give you more pain than plea&s;ure, I will wait upon you whenever you plea&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;ighed and pau&s;ed; &s;he knew not what to de&s;ire, yet rather wi&s;hed any thing to be done, than quietly to &s;it down to uninterrupted reflection.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I po&s;tpone quitting this place,"</Q> continued Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"till to-morrow

<P><Q REND="inline">"You will rejoice me,"</Q> cried Mrs. Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"by bearing me in your &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P>And &s;he then went into her carriage.</P>
<P>Cecilia, unfitted to attend her old friend, and unequal to the ta&s;k of explaining to her the cruel &s;cene in which &s;he had ju&s;t been engaged, then ha&s;tened to her own apartment. Her hitherto &s;tifled emotions broke forth in tears and repinings: her fate was finally determined, and its determina|tion was not more unhappy than humiliat|ing; &s;he was openly rejected by the family who&s;e alliance &s;he was known to wi&s;h; &s;he was compelled to refu&s;e the man of her choice, though &s;atisfied his affections were her own. A mi&s;ery &s;o peculiar &s;he found hard to &s;upport, and almo&s;t bur&s;ting with conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, her heart alternately &s;welled from offended pride, and &s;unk from di&s;appointed tenderne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A PERTURBATION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA was &s;till in this tempe&s;tuous &s;tate, when a me&s;&s;age was brought her that a gentleman was below &s;tairs, who beg|ged to have the honour of &s;eeing her. She concluded he was Delvile, and the thought of meeting him merely to communicate what mu&s;t &s;o bitterly afflict him, redoubled her di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he went down in an agony of perturbation and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>He met her at the door, where, before he could &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile,"</Q> &s;he cried, in a hurrying manner, <Q REND="inline">"why will you come? Why will you thus in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ee|ing me, in defiance of every ob&s;tacle, and in contempt of my prohibition?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heavens,"</Q> cried he, amazed, <Q REND="inline">"whence this reproach? Did you not per|mit me to wait upon you with the re&s;ult of my enquiries? Had I not your con&s;ent&mdash;but why do you look thus di&s;turbed?&mdash;Your eyes are red,&mdash;you have been weeping.&mdash;Oh my Cecilia! have <HI>I</HI> any &s;hare in your &s;orrow?&mdash;Tho&s;e tears, which never flow
<PB N="206" REF="205">
weakly, tell me, have they&mdash;has <HI>one</HI> of them been &s;hed upon my account?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"has been the re|&s;ult of your enquiries?&mdash;Speak quick, for I wi&s;h to know,&mdash;and in another in&s;tant I mu&s;t be gone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;trange,"</Q> cried the a&s;toni&s;hed Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is this language! how &s;trange are the&s;e looks! What new has come to pa&s;s? Has any fre&s;h calamity happened? Is there yet &s;ome evil which I do not ex|pect?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why will you not an&s;wer fir&s;t?"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"When <HI>I</HI> have &s;poken, you will perhaps be le&s;s willing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You terrify, you &s;hock, you amaze me! What dreadful blow awaits me? For what horror are you preparing me?&mdash;That which I have ju&s;t experienced, and which tore you from me even at the foot of the altar, &s;till remains inexplicable, &s;till continues to be involved in darkne&s;s and my&s;tery; for the wretch who &s;eparated us I have never been able to di&s;cover."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you procured, then, no intelli|gence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, none; though &s;ince we parted I have never re&s;ted a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Make, then, no further enquiry, for now all explanation would be u&s;ele&s;s. That we <HI>were</HI> parted, we know, though <HI>why</HI> we
<PB N="207" REF="206">
cannot tell: but that again we &s;hall ever meet&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;topt; her &s;treaming eyes ca&s;t up|wards, and a deep &s;igh bur&s;ting from her heart.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh what,"</Q> cried Delvile, endeavour|ing to take her hand, which &s;he ha&s;tily with|drew from him, <Q REND="inline">"what does this mean? love|lie&s;t, deare&s;t Cecilia, my betrothed, my af|fianced wife! why flow tho&s;e tears which agony only can wring from you? Why re|fu&s;e me that hand which &s;o lately was the pledge of your faith? Am I not the &s;ame Delvile to whom &s;o few days &s;ince you gave it? Why will you not open to him your heart? Why thus di&s;tru&s;t his honour, and repul&s;e his tenderne&s;s? Oh why, giving him &s;uch exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, refu&s;e him the &s;malle&s;t con&s;olation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What con&s;olation,"</Q> cried the weeping Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"can I give?" Alas! it is not, per|haps, <HI>you</HI> who mo&s;t want it!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here the door was opened by one of the Mi&s;s Charltons, who came into the room with a me&s;&s;age from her grand-mother, re|que&s;ting to &s;ee Cecilia. Cecilia, a&s;hamed of being thus &s;urpri&s;ed with Delvile, and in tears, waited not either to make any excu&s;e to him, or any an&s;wer to Mi&s;s Charlton, but in&s;tantly hurried out of the room;&mdash;not, however, to her old friend, whom now le&s;s
<PB N="208" REF="207">
than ever &s;he could meet, but to her own apartment, where a very &s;hort indulgence of grief was &s;ucceeded by the &s;evere&s;t exa|mination of her own conduct.</P>
<P>A retro&s;pection of this &s;ort rarely brings much &s;ubject of exultation, when made with the rigid &s;incerity of &s;ecret impartiality: &s;o much &s;tronger is our rea&s;on than our virtue, &s;o much higher our &s;en&s;e of duty than our performance!</P>
<P>All &s;he had done &s;he now repented, all &s;he had &s;aid &s;he di&s;approved; her conduct, &s;eldom equal to her notions of right, was now infinitely below them, and the re|proaches of her judgment made her forget for a while the afflictions which had mi&s;led it.</P>
<P>The &s;orrow to which &s;he had openly given way in the pre&s;ence of Delvile, though their total &s;eparation but the mo|ment before had been finally decreed, &s;he con&s;idered as a weak effu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, injurious to delicacy, and cen&s;urable by propriety. <Q REND="inline">"His power over my heart,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it were now, indeed, too late to conceal, but his power over my under&s;tand|ing it is time to cancel. I am not to be his,&mdash;my own voice has ratified the renun|ciation, and &s;ince I made it to his mother, it mu&s;t never, without her con&s;ent, be in|validated. Honour, therefore, to her, and
<PB N="209" REF="208">
regard for my&s;elf, equally command me to fly him, till I cea&s;e to be thus affected by his &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P>When Delvile, therefore, &s;ent up an en|treaty that he might be again admitted in|to her pre&s;ence, &s;he returned for an&s;wer that &s;he was not well, and could not &s;ee any body.</P>
<P>He then left the hou&s;e, and, in a few minutes, &s;he received the following note from him.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU drive me from you, Cecilia, tor|tured with &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and di&s;tracted with ap|prehen&s;ion,&mdash;you drive me from you, cer|tain of my mi&s;ery, yet leaving me to bear it as I may! I would call you unfeeling, but that I &s;aw you were unhappy; I would re|proach you with tyranny, but that your eyes when you quitted me were &s;wolen with weeping!

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="210" REF="209">The mixture of fondne&s;s and re&s;entment with which this letter was dictated, marked &s;o &s;trongly the &s;ufferings and di&s;ordered &s;tate of the writer, that all the &s;oftne&s;s of Cecilia returned when &s;he peru&s;ed it, and left her not a wi&s;h but to le&s;&s;en his inqui|etude, by a&s;&s;urances of unalterable regard: yet &s;he determined not to tru&s;t her&s;elf in his &s;ight, certain they could only meet to grieve over each other, and con&s;cious that a partici|pation of &s;orrow would but prove a recipro|cation of tenderne&s;s. Calling, therefore, upon her duty to re&s;i&s;t her inclination, &s;he re&s;olved to commit the whole affair to the will of Mrs. Delvile, to whom, though under no promi&s;e, &s;he now con&s;idered her|&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible. De&s;irous, however, to &s;horten the period of Delvile's uncertainty, &s;he would not wait till the time &s;he had ap|pointed to &s;ee his mother, but wrote the following note to ha&s;ten their meeting.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Hon. Mrs. DELVILE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your &s;on is now at Bury; &s;hall I acquaint him of your arrival? or will you announce it your&s;elf? Inform me of your de&s;ire, and I will endeavour to fulfil it. As my own Agent I regard my&s;elf no longer; if, as

<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, CECILIA BEVERLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When &s;he had &s;ent off this letter, her heart was more at ea&s;e, becau&s;e reconciled with her con&s;cience: &s;he had &s;acrificed the &s;on, &s;he had re&s;igned her&s;elf to the mother; it now only remained to heal her wounded pride, by &s;uffering the &s;acrifice with dignity, and to recover her tranquility in virtue, by making the re&s;ignation without repining.</P>
<P>Her reflections, too, growing clearer as the mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion was di&s;per&s;ed, &s;he recol|lected with confu&s;ion her cold and &s;ullen behaviour to Mrs. Delvile. That lady had but done what &s;he had believed was her duty, and that duty was no more than &s;he had been taught to expect from her. In the beginning of her vi&s;it, and while doubt|ful of its &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he had indeed, been au&s;tere, but the moment victory appeared in view, &s;he became tender, affectionate and gentle. Her ju&s;tice, therefore, con|demned the re&s;entment to which &s;he had given way, and &s;he fortified her mind for
<PB N="112" REF="211">
the interview which was to follow, by an earne&s;t de&s;ire to make reparation both to Mrs. Delvile and her&s;elf for that which was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In this re&s;olution &s;he was not a little &s;trengthened, by &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering with her&s;elf the great abatement to all her po&s;|&s;ible happine&s;s, which mu&s;t have been made by the humiliating circum&s;tance of forcing her&s;elf into a family which held all connec|tion with her as di&s;graceful. She de&s;ired not to be the wife even of Delvile upon &s;uch terms, for the more &s;he e&s;teemed and admired him, the more anxious &s;he became for his honour, and the le&s;s could &s;he en|dure being regarded her&s;elf as the occa&s;ion of its diminution.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, her plan of conduct &s;et|tled, with calmer &s;pirits, though a heavy heart, &s;he attended upon Mrs. Charlton; but fearing to lo&s;e the &s;teadine&s;s &s;he had ju&s;t acquired before it &s;hould be called upon, if &s;he tru&s;ted her&s;elf to relate the deci&s;ion which had been made, &s;he be&s;ought her for the pre&s;ent to di&s;pen&s;e with the account, and then forced her&s;elf into conver&s;ation upon le&s;s intere&s;ting &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This prudence had its proper effect, and with tolerable tranquility &s;he heard Mrs. Delvile again announced, and waited upon
<PB N="213" REF="212">
her in the parlour with an air of com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>Not &s;o did Mrs. Delvile receive her; &s;he was all eagerne&s;s and emotion; &s;he flew to her the moment &s;he appeared, and throw|ing her arms around her, warmly exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Oh charming girl! Saver of our family! pre&s;erver of our honour! How poor are words to expre&s;s my admiration! how in|adequate are thanks in return for &s;uch obli|gations as I owe you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You owe me none, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh; <Q REND="inline">"on <HI>my</HI> &s;ide will be all the obligation, if you can pardon the petulance of my behaviour this morn|ing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Call not by &s;o har&s;h a name,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"the keenne&s;s of a &s;en&s;ibility by which you have your&s;elf alone been the &s;ufferer. You have had a trial the mo&s;t &s;e|vere, and however able to &s;u&s;tain, it was impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould not feel it. That you &s;hould give up <HI>any</HI> man who&s;e friends &s;olicit not your alliance, your mind is too delicate to make wonderful; but your ge|nero&s;ity in &s;ubmitting, una&s;ked, the arrange|ment of that re&s;ignation to tho&s;e for who&s;e intere&s;t it is made, and your high &s;en&s;e of honour in holding your&s;elf accountable to <HI>me,</HI> though under no tie, and bound by no promi&s;e, mark a greatne&s;s of mind which
<PB N="214" REF="213">
calls for reverence rather than thanks, and which I never can prai&s;e half &s;o much as I admire."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who received this applau&s;e but as a confirmation of her rejection, thanked her only by court&s;ying; and Mrs. Delvile, having &s;eated her&s;elf next her, continued her &s;peech.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, you have the goodne&s;s to tell me, is here,&mdash;have you &s;een him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, blu&s;h|ing, <Q REND="inline">"but hardly for a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And he knows not of my arrival?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;I believe he certainly does not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sad, then, is the trial which awaits him, and heavy for me the office I mu&s;t perform! Do you expect to &s;ee him again?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;yes,&mdash;perhaps&mdash;indeed I hardly&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;tammered, and Mrs. Delvile, taking her hand, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Tell me, Mi&s;s Beverley, <HI>why</HI> &s;hould you &s;ee him again?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was thunder&s;truck by this que&s;|tion, and, colouring yet more deeply, looked down, but could not an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Con&s;ider,"</Q> continued Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> of any further meeting; your union is impo&s;&s;ible, you have nobly con|&s;ented to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of it: why then tear your own heart, and torture
<PB N="215" REF="214">
his, by an intercour&s;e which &s;eems nothing but an ill-judged invitation to fruitle&s;s and unavailing &s;orrow?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;till &s;ilent; the truth of the expo&s;tulation her rea&s;on acknowledged, but to a&s;&s;ent to its con&s;equence her whole heart refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The ungenerous triumph of little fe|male vanity,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is far, I am &s;ure, from your mind, of which the en|largement and liberality will rather find con&s;olation from le&s;&s;ening than from im|bittering his &s;ufferings. Speak to me, then, and tell me, hone&s;tly, judiciou&s;ly, candidly tell me,&mdash;will it not be wi&s;er and more right, to avoid rather than &s;eek an object which can only give birth to regret? an in|terview which can excite no &s;en&s;ations but of mi&s;ery and &s;adne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then turned pale, &s;he endeavoured to &s;peak, but could not; &s;he wi&s;hed to comply,&mdash;yet to think &s;he had &s;een him for the la&s;t time, to remember how abruptly &s;he had parted from him, and to fear &s;he had treated him unkindly;&mdash;the&s;e were ob|&s;tacles which oppo&s;ed her concurrence, though both judgment and propriety de|manded it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, after a pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"can you wi&s;h to &s;ee Mor|timer merely to behold his grief? Can you
<PB N="216" REF="215">
de&s;ire he &s;hould &s;ee you, only to &s;harpen his affliction at your lo&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">O no!"</Q> cried Cecilia, to whom this re|proof re&s;tored &s;peech and re&s;olution, <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;o de&s;picable, I am not, I hope, &s;o un|worthy!&mdash;I will be ruled by you wholly; I will commit to you every thing;&mdash;yet <HI>once,</HI> perhaps,&mdash;no more!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, my dear Mi&s;s Beverley! to meet confe&s;&s;edly for <HI>once,</HI>&mdash;what were that but planting a dagger in the heart of Mor|timer? What were it but infu&s;ing poi&s;on in|to your own?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you think &s;o, madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I had better&mdash;I will certainly&mdash;"</Q> &s;he &s;ighed, &s;tammered, and &s;topt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hear me,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"and rather let me try to convince than per&s;uade you. Were there any po&s;&s;ibility, by argu|ment, by reflection, or even by accident, to remove the ob&s;tacles to our connection, then would it be well to meet, for then might di&s;cu&s;&s;ion turn to account, and an in|terchange of &s;entiments be productive of &s;ome happy expedient: but here&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She he&s;itated, and Cecilia, &s;hocked and a&s;hamed, turned away her face, and cried <Q REND="inline">"I know, madam, what you would &s;ay,&mdash;here all is over! and therefore&mdash;"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Daughter of my mind!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, ri&s;ing and embracing her, <Q REND="inline">"noble, generous, yet gentle Cecilia! what tie, what connection, could make you more dear to me?

<P>She then tenderly embraced her, and ab|ruptly took her leave.</P>
<P>Cecilia had now acted her part, and acted it to her own &s;atisfaction; but the curtain dropt when Mrs. Delvile left the hou&s;e, na|ture re&s;umed her rights, and the &s;orrow of her heart was no longer di&s;gui&s;ed or repre&s;&s;|ed. Some faint ray of hope had till now broke through the gloomie&s;t cloud of her mi&s;ery, and &s;ecretly flattered her that its di&s;per&s;ion was po&s;&s;ible, though di&s;tant: but that ray was extinct, that hope was no more; &s;he had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to bani&s;h Del|vile her &s;ight, and his mother had ab&s;olutely declared that even the &s;ubject had been di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton, impatient of &s;ome expla|nation of the morning's tran&s;actions, &s;oon &s;ent again to beg Cecilia would come to her. Cecilia reluctantly obeyed, for &s;he feared encrea&s;ing her indi&s;po&s;ition by the in|telligence &s;he had to communicate; &s;he &s;truggled, therefore, to appear to her with tolerable calmne&s;s, and in briefly relating what had pa&s;&s;ed, forbore to mingle with the narrative her own feelings and unhappi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="220">
Mrs. Charlton heard the account with the utmo&s;t concern; &s;he accu&s;ed Mrs. Del|vile of &s;everity, and even of cruelty; &s;he lamented the &s;trange accident by which the marriage ceremony had been &s;topt, and re|gretted that it had not again been begun, as the only means to have rendered ineffec|tual the pre&s;ent fatal interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But the grief of Cecilia, however violent, induced her not to join in this regret: &s;he mourned only the ob&s;tacle which had occa&s;ioned the &s;eparation, and not the inci|dent which had merely interrupted the ce|remony: convinced, by the conver&s;ations in which &s;he had ju&s;t been engaged, of Mrs. Delvile's inflexibility, &s;he rather rejoiced than repined that &s;he had put it to no near|er trial: &s;orrow was all &s;he felt; for her mind was too liberal to harbour re&s;entment again&s;t a conduct which &s;he &s;aw was dic|tated by a &s;en&s;e of right; and too ductile and too affectionate to remain unmoved by the per&s;onal kindne&s;s which had &s;oftened the rejection, and the many marks of e&s;teem and regard which had &s;hewn her it was la|mented, though con&s;idered as indi&s;pen|&s;able.</P>
<P>How and by whom this affair had been betrayed to Mrs. Delvile &s;he knew not; but the di&s;covery was nothing le&s;s than &s;ur|pri&s;ing, &s;ince, by various unfortunate ac|cidents,
<PB N="222" REF="221">
it was known to &s;o many, and &s;ince, in the horror and confu&s;ion of the my&s;te|rious prohibition to the marriage, neither Delvile nor her&s;elf had thought of even at|tempting to give any caution to the wit|ne&s;&s;es of that &s;cene, not to make it known: an attempt, however, which mu&s;t almo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have been unavailing, as the inci|dent was too extraordinary and too &s;ingular to have any chance of &s;uppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, one of the &s;er|vants came to inform Cecilia, that a man was below to enquire if there was no an&s;wer to the note he had brought in the fore|noon.</P>
<P>Cecilia, greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, knew not upon what to re&s;olve; that the patience of Delvile &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, &s;he did not, indeed, wonder, and to relieve his anxiety was now almo&s;t her only wi&s;h; &s;he would therefore in&s;tantly have written to him, confe&s;&s;ed her &s;ympathy in his &s;ufferings, and be&s;ought him to endure with fortitude an evil which was no longer to be with&s;tood: but &s;he was uncertain whether he was yet acquainted with the journey of his mother to Bury, and having agreed to commit to her the whole management of the affair, &s;he feared it would be di&s;honourable to take any &s;tep in it without her concurrence. She returned,
<PB N="223" REF="222">
therefore, a me&s;&s;age that &s;he had yet no an&s;wer ready.</P>
<P>In a very few minutes Delvile called him|&s;elf, and &s;ent up an earne&s;t reque&s;t for per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Here, at lea&s;t, &s;he had no perplexity; an interview &s;he had given her po&s;itive word to refu&s;e, and therefore, without a moment's he&s;itation, &s;he bid the &s;ervant inform him &s;he was particularly engaged, and &s;orry it was not in her power to &s;ee any company.</P>
<P>In the greate&s;t perturbation he left the hou&s;e, and immediately wrote to her the following lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I entreat you to &s;ee me! if only for an in&s;tant, I entreat, I implore you to &s;ee me! Mrs. Charlton may be pre&s;ent,&mdash;all the world, if you wi&s;h it, may be pre&s;ent,&mdash;but deny me not admi&s;&s;ion, I &s;upplicate, I conjure you!</P>
<P>I will call in an hour; in that time you may have fini&s;hed your pre&s;ent engagement. I will otherwi&s;e wait longer, and call again. You will not, I think, turn me from your door, and, till I have &s;een you, I can only live in its vicinity.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="224" REF="223">
The man who brought this note, waited not for any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Cecilia read it in an agony of mind inex|pre&s;&s;ible: &s;he &s;aw, by its &s;tyle, how much Delvile was irritated, and her knowledge of his temper made her certain his irritation proceeded from believing him&s;elf ill-u&s;ed. She ardently wi&s;hed to appea&s;e and to quiet him, and regretted the nece&s;&s;ity of appear|ing obdurate and unfeeling, even more, at that moment, than the &s;eparation it&s;elf. To a mind priding in its purity, and animated in its affections, few &s;en&s;ations can excite keener mi&s;ery, than tho&s;e by which an appre|hen&s;ion is rai&s;ed of being thought worth|le&s;s or ungrateful by the objects of our cho&s;en regard. To be deprived of their &s;ociety is le&s;s bitter, to be robbed of our own tranquillity by any other means, is le&s;s afflicting.</P>
<P>Yet to this it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit, or incur the only penalty which, to &s;uch a mind, would be more &s;evere, &s;elf-reproach: &s;he had promi&s;ed to be governed by Mrs. Del|vile, &s;he had nothing, therefore, to do but obey her.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>to turn,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, <HI>from the door,</HI> a man who, but for an incident the mo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible, would now have been &s;ole ma&s;ter of her&s;elf and her ac|tions, &s;eemed &s;o unkind and &s;o tyrannical,
<PB N="225" REF="224">
that &s;he could not endure to be within hearing of his repul&s;e: &s;he begged, there|fore, the u&s;e of Mrs. Charlton's carriage, and determined to make a vi&s;it to Mrs. Harrel till Delvile and his mother had wholly quitted Bury. She was not, indeed, quite &s;atisfied in going to the hou&s;e of Mr. Arnott, but &s;he had no time to weigh ob|jections, and knew not any other place to which &s;till greater might not be &s;tarted.</P>
<P>She wrote a &s;hort letter to Mrs. Delvile, acquainting her with her purpo&s;e, and its rea&s;on, and repeating her a&s;&s;urances that &s;he would be guided by her implicitly; and then, embracing Mrs. Charlton, whom &s;he left to the care of her grand-daughters, &s;he got into a chai&s;e, accompanied only by her maid, and one man and hor&s;e, and ordered the po&s;tilion to drive to Mr. Arnott's.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A COTTAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening was already far advanced, and before &s;he arrived at the end of her little journey it was quite dark. When they came within a mile of Mr. Arnott's hou&s;e, the po&s;tilion, in turning too &s;ud|denly from the turnpike to the cro&s;s-road, over&s;et the carriage. The accident, how|ever, occa&s;ioned no other mi&s;chief than de|laying their proceeding, and Cecilia and her maid were helped out of the chai&s;e unhurt. The &s;ervants, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a man who was walking upon the road, began lifting it up; and Cecilia, too bu&s;y within to be attentive to what pa&s;&s;ed without, di&s;|regarded what went forward, till &s;he heard her footman call for help. She then ha&s;tily advanced to enquire what was the matter, and found that the pa&s;&s;enger who had lent his aid, had, by working in the dark, un|fortunately &s;lipped his foot under one of the wheels, and &s;o much hurt it, that with|out great pain he could not put it to the ground.</P>
<P>Cecilia immediately de&s;ired that the &s;uf|ferer
<PB N="227" REF="226">
might be carried to his own home in the chai&s;e, while &s;he and the maid walked on to Mr. Arnott's, attended by her &s;er|vant on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>This little incident proved of &s;ingular &s;ervice to her upon fir&s;t entering the hou&s;e; Mrs. Harrel was at &s;upper with her brother, and hearing the voice of Cecilia in the hall, ha&s;tened with the extreme&s;t &s;urpri&s;e to en|quire what had occa&s;ioned &s;o late a vi&s;it; followed by Mr. Arnott, who&s;e amazement was accompanied with a thou&s;and other &s;en&s;ations too powerful for &s;peech. Cecilia, unprepared with any excu&s;e, in&s;tantly re|lated the adventure &s;he had met with on the road, which quieted their curio&s;ity, by turning their attention to her per&s;onal &s;afety. They ordered a room to be pre|pared for her, entreated her to go to re&s;t with all &s;peed, and po&s;tpone any fur|ther account till the next day. With this reque&s;t &s;he mo&s;t gladly complied, happy to be &s;pared the embarra&s;ment of enquiry, and rejoiced to be relieved from the fatigue of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Her night was re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable: to know how Delvile would bear her flight was never a moment from her thoughts, and to hear whether he would obey or op|po&s;e his mother was her ince&s;&s;ant wi&s;h. She was fixt, however, to be faithful in refu&s;ing
<PB N="228" REF="227">
to &s;ee him, and at lea&s;t to &s;uffer nothing new from her own enterprize or fault.</P>
<P>Early in the morning Mrs. Harrel came to &s;ee her. She was eager to learn why, after invitations repeatedly refu&s;ed, &s;he was thus &s;uddenly arrived without any; and &s;he was &s;till more eager to talk of her&s;elf, and relate the weary life &s;he led thus &s;hut up in the country, and confined to the &s;ociety of her brother.</P>
<P>Cecilia evaded giving any immediate an&s;wer to her que&s;tions, and Mrs. Harrel, happy in an opportunity to rehear&s;e her own complaints, &s;oon forgot that &s;he had a&s;ked any, and, in a very &s;hort time, was per|fectly, though imperceptibly, contented to be her&s;elf the only &s;ubject upon which they conver&s;ed.</P>
<P>But not &s;uch was the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of Mr. Arnott; and Cecilia, when &s;he went down to breakfa&s;t, perceived with the utmo&s;t concern that he had pa&s;&s;ed a night as &s;leep|le&s;s as her own. A vi&s;it &s;o &s;udden, &s;o un|expected, and &s;o unaccountable, from an object that no di&s;couragement could make him think of with indifference, had been a &s;ubject to him of conjecture and wonder that had revived all the hopes and the fears which had lately, though &s;till unextin|gui&s;hed, lain dormant. The enquiries, however, which his &s;i&s;ter had given up, he
<PB N="229" REF="228">
ventured not to renew, and thought him&s;elf but too happy in her pre&s;ence, whatever might be the cau&s;e of her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>He perceived, however, immediately, the &s;adne&s;s that hung upon her mind, and his own was redoubled by the &s;ight: Mrs. Harrel, al&s;o, &s;aw that &s;he looked ill, but attributed it to the fatigue and fright of the preceding evening, well knowing that a &s;imilar accident would have made her ill her&s;elf, or fancy that &s;he was &s;o.</P>
<P>During breakfa&s;t, Cecilia &s;ent for the po&s;tilion, to enquire of him how the man had fared, who&s;e good-natured a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their di&s;tre&s;s had been &s;o unfortunate to him&s;elf. He an&s;wered that he had turned out to be a day labourer, who lived about half a mile off. And then, partly to gra|tify her own humanity, and partly to find any other employment for her&s;elf and friends than unintere&s;ting conver&s;ation, &s;he propo&s;ed that they &s;hould all walk to the poor man's habitation, and offer him &s;ome amends for the injury he had received. This was readily a&s;&s;ented to, and the po&s;ti|lion directed them whither to go.</P>
<P>The place was a cottage, &s;ituated upon a common; they entered it without cere|mony, and found a clean looking woman at work.</P>
<P>Cecilia enquired for her hu&s;band, and
<PB N="230" REF="229">
was told that he was gone out to day|labour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very glad to hear it,"</Q> returned &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I hope then he has got the better of the accident he met with la&s;t night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was not him, madam,"</Q> &s;aid the woman, <Q REND="inline">"met with the accident, it was John;&mdash;there he is, working in the garden."</Q></P>
<P>To the garden then they all went, and &s;aw him upon the ground, weeding.</P>
<P>The moment they approached he aro&s;e, and, without &s;peaking, began to limp, for he could hardly walk, away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, ma&s;ter,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that you are &s;o much hurt. Have you had any thing put to your foot?"</Q></P>
<P>The man made no an&s;wer, but &s;till turned away from her; a glance, however, of his eye, which the next in&s;tant he fixed upon the ground, &s;tartled her; &s;he moved round to look at him again,&mdash;and per|ceived Mr. Belfield!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> &s;he exclaimed; but &s;eeing him &s;till retreat, &s;he recollected in a moment how little he would be obliged to her for betraying him, and, &s;uffering him to go on, turned back to her party, and led the way again into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t emotion of her &s;ur|pri&s;e was over, &s;he enquired how long <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="230">
had belonged to this cottage, and what was his way of life.</P>
<P>The woman an&s;wered he had only been with them a week, and that he went out to day-labour with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Cecilia then, finding their &s;tay kept him from his employment, and willing to &s;ave him the di&s;tre&s;s of being &s;een by Mr. Ar|nott or Mrs. Harrel, propo&s;ed their re|turning home. She grieved mo&s;t &s;incerely at beholding in &s;o melancholy an occupa|tion a young man of &s;uch talents and abi|lities; &s;he wi&s;hed much to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and began con&s;idering by what means it might be done, when, as they were walking from the cottage, a voice at &s;ome di&s;tance called out <Q REND="inline">"Madam! Mi&s;s Beverley!"</Q> and, looking round, to her utter amazement &s;he &s;aw Belfield endeavouring to follow her.</P>
<P>She in&s;tantly &s;topt, and he advanced, his hat in his hand, and his whole air indicat|ing he &s;ought not to be di&s;gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at this &s;udden change of beha|viour, &s;he then &s;tept forward to meet him, accompanied by her friends: but when they came up to each other, &s;he checked her de&s;ire of &s;peaking, to leave him fully at liberty to make him&s;elf known, or keep concealed.</P>
<P>He bowed with a look of a&s;&s;umed gaiety and ea&s;e, but the deep &s;carlet that tinged
<PB N="232" REF="231">
his whole face manife&s;ted his internal con|fu&s;ion; and in a voice that attempted to &s;ound lively, though its tremulous accents betrayed unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, he ex|claimed, with a forced &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;|&s;ible Mi&s;s Beverley can deign to notice a poor mi&s;erable day-labourer &s;uch as I am? how will &s;he be ju&s;tified in the beau monde, when even the &s;ight of &s;uch a wretch ought to fill her with horror? Henceforth let hy&s;tericks be blown to the winds, and let nerves be di&s;carded from the female voca|bulary, &s;ince a lady &s;o young and fair can &s;tand this &s;hock without hart&s;horn or fainting!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am happy,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to find your &s;pirits &s;o good; yet my own, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are not rai&s;ed by &s;eeing you in this &s;trange &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;pirits!"</Q> cried he, with an air of defiance, <Q REND="inline">"never were they better, never &s;o good as at this moment. Strange as &s;eems my &s;ituation, it is all that I wi&s;h; I have found out, at la&s;t, the true &s;ecret of happine&s;s! that &s;ecret which &s;o long I pur|&s;ued in vain, but which always eluded my gra&s;p, till the in&s;tant of de&s;pair arrived, when, &s;lackening my pace, I gave it up as a phantom. Go from me, I cried, I will be cheated no more! thou airy bubble! thou fleeting &s;hadow! I will live no longer
<PB N="233" REF="232">
in thy &s;ight, &s;ince thy beams dazzle without warming me! Mankind &s;eems only com|po&s;ed as matter for thy experiments, and I will quit the whole race, that thy delu&s;ions may be pre&s;ented to me no more!"</Q></P>
<P>This romantic flight, which &s;tartled even Cecilia, though acquainted with his cha|racter, gave to Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Ar|nott the utmo&s;t &s;urprize; his appearance, and the account they had ju&s;t heard of him, having by no means prepared them for &s;uch &s;entiments or &s;uch language.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is then this great &s;ecret of happine&s;s,</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"nothing, at la&s;t, but total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"it is Labour with Independence."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now wi&s;hed much to a&s;k &s;ome explanation of his affairs, but was doubtful whether he would gratify her before Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott, and hurt to keep him &s;tanding, though he leant upon a &s;tick; &s;he told him, therefore, &s;he would at pre|&s;ent detain him no longer, but endeavour again to &s;ee him before &s;he quitted her friends.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott then interfered, and de&s;ired his &s;i&s;ter would entreat Mi&s;s Beverley to invite whom &s;he plea&s;ed to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him, and in&s;tantly a&s;ked Belfield to call upon her in the afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233">
<Q REND="inline">"No, madam, no,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I have done with vi&s;its and &s;ociety!

<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not venture then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to enquire&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Enquire, madam,"</Q> interrupted he with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"what you plea&s;e: there is nothing I will not an&s;wer to you,&mdash;to this lady, to this gentleman, to any and to every body. What can I wi&s;h to conceal, where I have nothing to gain or to lo&s;e? When fir&s;t, indeed, I &s;aw you, I involun|tarily &s;hrunk; a weak &s;hame for a moment &s;eized me, I felt fallen and deba&s;ed, and I wi&s;hed to avoid you: but a little recollec|tion brought me back to my &s;en&s;es. And where, cried I, is the di&s;grace of exerci&s;ing for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence the &s;trength with which I am endued? and why &s;hould I blu&s;h to lead the life which uncorrupted Nature fir&s;t pre&s;cribed to man?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, more and more intere&s;ted to hear him, <Q REND="inline">"if you will not vi&s;it us, will you at lea&s;t permit us to return with you to &s;ome place where you can be &s;eated?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234">
<Q REND="inline">"I will with plea&s;ure,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"go to any place where you may be &s;eated your|&s;elves; but for me, I have cea&s;ed to regard accommodation or inconvenience."</Q></P>
<P>They then all went back to the cottage, which was now empty, the woman being out at work.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you then, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"give me leave to enquire whether Lord Vannelt is acquainted with your retirement, and if it will not much &s;urprize and di&s;ap|point him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Vannelt,"</Q> cried he, haughtily, <Q REND="inline">"has no right to be &s;urpri&s;ed. I would have quitted <HI>his</HI> hou&s;e, if no other, not even this cottage, had a roof to afford me &s;helter!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, indeed, to hear it,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"I had hoped he would have known your value, and merited your regard."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ill-u&s;age,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"is as hard to relate as to be endured. There is com|monly &s;omething pitiful in a complaint; and though oppre&s;&s;ion in a general &s;en&s;e provokes the wrath of mankind, the in|ve&s;tigation of its minuter circum&s;tances ex|cites nothing but deri&s;ion. Tho&s;e who give the offence, by the worthy few may be hated, but tho&s;e who receive it, by the world at large will be de&s;pi&s;ed. Con&s;cious
<PB N="236" REF="235">
of this, I di&s;dained making any appeal; my&s;elf the only &s;ufferer, I had a right to be the only judge, and, &s;haking off the ba&s;e trammels of intere&s;t and &s;ubjection, I quitted the hou&s;e in &s;ilent indignation, not chu&s;ing to remon&s;trate, where I de&s;ired not to be reconciled."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was there no mode of life,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to adopt, but living with Lord Vannelt, or giving up the whole world?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I weighed every thing maturely,"</Q> an|&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"before I made my determina|tion, and I found it &s;o much the mo&s;t eli|gible, that I am certain I can never repent it. I had friends who would with plea&s;ure have pre&s;ented me to &s;ome other noble|man; but my whole heart revolted again&s;t leading that kind of life, and I would not, therefore, idly rove from one great man to another, adding ill-will to di&s;grace, and pur&s;uing hope in defiance of common &s;en&s;e; no; when I quitted Lord Vannelt, I re|&s;olved to give up patronage for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I retired to private lodgings to delibe|rate what next could be done. I had lived in many ways, I had been unfortunate or imprudent in all.

<PB N="237" REF="236">
had then its turn, but the expence to which it led was ruinous, and &s;elf-reproach baffled plea&s;ure while I pur&s;ued it; I have even&mdash;yes, there are few things I have left un|tried,&mdash;I have even,&mdash;for why now di&s;gui&s;e it?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt and coloured, but in a quicker voice pre&s;ently proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Trade, al&s;o, has had its &s;hare in my expe|riments; for that, in truth, I was originally de&s;tined,&mdash;but my education had ill &s;uited me to &s;uch a de&s;tination, and the trader's fir&s;t maxim I rever&s;ed, in lavi&s;hing when I ought to have accumulated.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, remained for me? to run over again the &s;ame irk&s;ome round I had not patience, and to attempt any thing new I was unqualified: money I had none; my friends I could bear to burthen no longer; a fortnight I lingered in wretched irre&s;o|lution,&mdash;a &s;imple accident at the end of it happily &s;ettled me; I was walking, one morning, in Hyde Park, forming a thou|&s;and plans for my future life, but quar|relling with them all; when a gentleman met me on hor&s;eback, from whom, at my Lord Vannelt's, I had received particular civilities; I looked another way not to be &s;een by him, and the change in my dre&s;s &s;ince I left his Lord&s;hip's made me ea&s;ily pa&s;s unnoticed. He had rode on, however,
<PB N="238" REF="237">
but a few yards, before, by &s;ome accident or mi&s;management, he had a fall from his hor&s;e. Forgetting all my caution, I flew in&s;tantly to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he was brui&s;ed, but not otherwi&s;e hurt; I helpt him up, and he leant upon my arm; in my ha&s;te of enquiring how he had fared, I called him by his name. He knew me, but looked &s;urpri&s;ed at my appearance; he was &s;peak|ing to me, however, with kindne&s;s, when &s;eeing &s;ome gentlemen of his acquaintance gallopping up to him, he ha&s;tily di&s;engaged him&s;elf from me, and in&s;tantly beginning to recount to them what had happened, he &s;edulou&s;ly looked another way, and joining his new companions, walked off without taking further notice of me. For a moment I was almo&s;t tempted to trouble him to come back; but a little recollection told me how ill he de&s;erved my re&s;entment, and bid me transfer it for the future from the pitiful individual to the worthle&s;s community.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here fini&s;hed my deliberation; the di&s;gu&s;t to the world which I had already conceived, this little incident confirmed; I I &s;aw it was only made for the great and the rich;&mdash;poor, therefore, and low, what had I to do in it?

<Q REND="inline">"I wrote to Lord Vannelt to &s;end my trunks to my mother; I wrote to my mother that I was well, and would &s;oon let her hear more: I then paid off my lodg|ings, and <Q REND="inline">"&s;haking the du&s;t from my feet,"</Q> bid a long adieu to London; and, com|mitting my route to chance, &s;trole on into the country, without knowing or caring which way.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My fir&s;t thought was &s;imply to &s;eek retirement, and to depend for my future repo&s;e upon nothing but a total &s;eclu&s;ion from &s;ociety: but my &s;low method of tra|velling gave me time for reflection, and reflection &s;oon &s;hewed me the error of this notion.</Q></P>

<P>He &s;topt; and Cecilia, who had li&s;tened to this narrative with a mixture of com|pa&s;&s;ion, admiration and cen&s;ure, was too
<PB N="241" REF="240">
much &s;truck with its &s;ingularity to be readily able to an&s;wer it. Her curio&s;ity to hear him had &s;prung wholly from her de&s;ire to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and &s;he had expected from his &s;tory to gather &s;ome hint upon which her &s;ervices might be offered. But none had occurred; he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf fully &s;atis|fied with his &s;ituation; and though rea&s;on and probability contradicted the profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he could not venture to di&s;pute it with any delicacy or prudence.</P>
<P>She thanked him, therefore, for his rela|tion, with many apologies for the trouble &s;he had given him, and added, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not expre&s;s my concern for misfortunes which you &s;eem to regard as conducive to your contentment, nor remon&s;trate at the &s;tep you have taken, &s;ince you have been led to it by choice, not nece&s;&s;ity: but yet, you mu&s;t pardon me if I cannot help hoping I &s;hall &s;ome time &s;ee you happier, according to the common, however vulgar ideas of the re&s;t of the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, never, never! I am &s;ick of man|kind, not from theory, but experience; and the precautions I have taken again&s;t mental fatigue, will &s;ecure me from repentance, or any de&s;ire of change; for it is not the active, but the indolent who weary; it is not the temperate, but the pampered who are capricious."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="241">
<Q REND="inline">"Is your &s;i&s;ter, Sir, acquainted with this change in your fortune and opinions?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor girl, no! She and her unhappy mother have borne but too long with my enterprizes and misfortunes. Even yet they would &s;acrifice whatever they po&s;&s;e&s;s to enable me to play once more the game &s;o often lo&s;t; but I will not abu&s;e their affec|tion, nor &s;uffer them again to be &s;laves to my caprices, nor dupes to their own delu|&s;ive expectations. I have &s;ent them word I am happy; I have not yet told them how or where. I fear much the affliction of their di&s;appointment, and, for a while, &s;hall conceal from them my &s;ituation, which they would fancy was di&s;graceful, and grieve at as cruel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is it <HI>not</HI> cruel?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is labour indeed &s;o &s;weet? and can you &s;eri|ou&s;ly derive happine&s;s from what all others con&s;ider as mi&s;ery?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;weet,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"in it&s;elf; but &s;weet, mo&s;t &s;weet and &s;alutary in its effects. When I work, I forget all the world; my projects for the future, my di&s;|appointments from the pa&s;t. Mental fa|tigue is overpowered by per&s;onal; I toil till I require re&s;t, and that re&s;t which na|ture, not luxury demands, leads not to idle meditation, but to &s;ound, heavy, nece&s;&s;ary &s;leep. I awake the next morning to the

<P><Q REND="inline">"And if this,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is the life of happine&s;s, why have we &s;o many complaints of the &s;ufferings of the poor, and why &s;o eternally do we hear of their hard&s;hips and di&s;tre&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They have known no other life. They are &s;trangers, therefore, to the felicity of their lot. Had they mingled in the world, fed high their fancy with hope, and looked forward with expectation of enjoyment; had they been courted by the great, and offered with profu&s;ion adulation for their abilities, yet, even when &s;tarving, been offered nothing el&s;e!&mdash;had they &s;een an attentive circle wait all its entertainment from their powers, yet found them&s;elves forgotten as &s;oon as out of &s;ight, and per|ceived them&s;elves avoided when no longer buffoons!&mdash;Oh had they known and felt provocations &s;uch as the&s;e, how gladly would their re&s;entful &s;pirits turn from the whole unfeeling race, and how would they re&s;pect that noble and manly labour, which at once di&s;entangles them from &s;uch &s;ub|jugating &s;nares, and enables them to fly the ingratitude they abhor! Without the contra&s;t of vice, virtue unloved may be
<PB N="244" REF="243">
lovely; without the experience of mi&s;ery, happine&s;s is &s;imply a dull privation of evil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And are you &s;o content,"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"with your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as even to think it offers you reparation for your pa&s;t &s;ufferings?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Content!"</Q> repeated he with energy, <Q REND="inline">"O more than content, I am proud of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation! I glory in &s;hewing to the world, I glory &s;till more in &s;hewing to my&s;elf, that tho&s;e whom I cannot but de|&s;pi&s;e I will not &s;cruple to defy, and that where I have been treated unworthily, I will &s;corn to be obliged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But will you pardon me,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould I a&s;k again, why in quitting Lord Vannelt, you concluded no one el&s;e worthy a trial?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e it was le&s;s my Lord Vannelt, madam, than my own &s;ituation, that di&s;|gu&s;ted me: for though I liked not his be|haviour, I found him a man too generally e&s;teemed to flatter my&s;elf better u&s;age would await me in merely changing my abode, while my &s;tation was the &s;ame. I believe, indeed, he never meant to offend me; but I was offended the more that he &s;hould think me an object to receive in|dignity without knowing it. To have had this pointed out to him, would have been
<PB N="245" REF="244">
at once mortifying and vain; for delicacy, like ta&s;te, can only partially be taught, and will always be &s;uperficial and erring where it is not innate. Tho&s;e wrongs, which though too trifling to re&s;ent, are too humi|liating to be borne, &s;peech can convey no idea of; the &s;oul mu&s;t feel, or the under|&s;tanding can never comprehend them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But &s;urely,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"though people of refinement are rare, they yet exi&s;t; why, then, remove your&s;elf from the po&s;&s;ibility of meeting with them?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I run about the nation,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"proclaiming my di&s;tre&s;s, and de|&s;cribing my temper? telling the world that though dependent I demand re&s;pect as well as a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and publi&s;hing to mankind, that though poor I will accept no gifts if offered with contumely? Who will li&s;ten to &s;uch an account? who will care for my misfortunes, but as they may humble me to his &s;ervice? who will hear my mortifications, but to &s;ay I de&s;erve them? what has the world to do with my feelings and peculiarities? I know it too well to think calamity will &s;often it; I need no new le&s;&s;ons to in&s;truct me that to conquer affliction is more wi&s;e than to relate it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Unfortunate as you have been,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot wonder at your a&s;pe|rity; but yet, it is &s;urely no more than

ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that hard-hearted|ne&s;s to di&s;tre&s;s is by no means the fault of the pre&s;ent times: on the contrary, it is &s;carce &s;ooner made known, then every one is ready to contribute to its relief."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how contribute?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"by a paltry donation of money? Yes, the man who&s;e only want is a few guineas, may, in|deed, obtain them; but he who a&s;ks kind|ne&s;s and protection, who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit calls for con&s;olation even more than his ruined fortune for repair, how is his &s;truggling foul, if &s;uperior to his fate, to brook the o&s;tentation of patronage, and the in&s;olence of conde&s;cen&s;ion? Yes, yes, the world will &s;ave the poor beggar who is &s;tarving; but the fallen wretch, who will not cringe for his &s;upport, may con&s;ume in his own wretchedne&s;s without pity and with|out help!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now &s;aw that the wound his &s;en|&s;ibility had received was too painful for argument, and too recent immediately to be healed. She forbore, therefore, to de|tain him any longer, but expre&s;&s;ing her be&s;t wi&s;hes, without venturing to hint at her &s;ervices, &s;he aro&s;e, and they all took their leave;&mdash;Belfield ha&s;tening, as they went, to return to the garden, where, looking over the hedge as they pa&s;&s;ed, they &s;aw him employed again in weeding, with the
<PB N="247" REF="246">
eagerne&s;s of a man who pur&s;ues his &s;a|vourite occupation.</P>
<P>Cecilia half forgot her own anxieties and &s;adne&s;s, in the concern which &s;he felt for this unfortunate and extraordinary young man. She wi&s;hed much to devi&s;e &s;ome means for drawing him from a life of &s;uch hard&s;hip and ob&s;curity; but what to a man thus <Q REND="inline">"jealous in honour,"</Q> thus &s;crupulous in delicacy, could &s;he propo&s;e, without more ri&s;k of offence, than probability of obliging? His account had, indeed, con|vinced her how much he &s;tood in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but it had &s;hewn her no le&s;s how fa&s;tidious he would be in receiving it.</P>
<P>Nor was &s;he wholly without fear that an earne&s;t &s;olicitude to &s;erve him, his youth, talents, and &s;triking manners con&s;idered, might occa&s;ion even in him&s;elf a mi&s;con|&s;truction of her motives, &s;uch as &s;he al|ready had given birth to in his forward and partial mother.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent, therefore, all circum&s;tances weighed, &s;eemed no &s;ea&s;on for her libera|lity, which &s;he yet re&s;olved to exert the fir&s;t moment it was un-oppo&s;ed by propriety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A CONTEST.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;t of the day was pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing this adventure; but in the evening, Cecilia's intere&s;t in it was all &s;unk, by the reception of the following letter from Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s BEVERLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I grieve to interrupt the tranquillity of a retirement &s;o judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, and I lament the nece&s;&s;ity of again calling to trial the virtue of which the exertion, though &s;o captivating, is &s;o painful; but alas, my ex|cellent young friend, we came not hither to enjoy, but to &s;uffer; and happy only are tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ufferings have neither by folly been &s;ought, nor by guilt been me|rited, but ari&s;ing merely from the imper|fection of humanity, have been re&s;i&s;ted with fortitude, or endured with patience.</P>
<P>I am informed of your virtuous &s;teadi|ne&s;s, which corre&s;ponds with my expecta|tions, while it excites my re&s;pect. All further conflict I had hoped to have &s;aved

you; and to the triumph of your goodne&s;s I had tru&s;ted for the recovery of your peace: but Mortimer has di&s;appointed me, and our work is &s;till unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>He avers that he is &s;olemnly engaged to you, and in pleading to me his honour, he &s;ilences both expo&s;tulation and authority. From your own words alone will he ac|knowledge his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; and notwith|&s;tanding my reluctance to impo&s;e upon you this ta&s;k, I cannot &s;ilence or quiet him without making the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>For a purpo&s;e &s;uch as this, can you, then, admit us? Can you bear with your own lips to confirm the irrevocable deci&s;ion? You will feel, I am &s;ure, for the unfortu|nate Mortimer, and it was earne&s;tly my de&s;ire to &s;pare you the &s;ight of his affliction; yet &s;uch is my confidence in your prudence, that &s;ince I find him bent upon &s;eeing you, I am not without hope, that from wit|ne&s;&s;ing the greatne&s;s of your mind, the in|terview may rather calm than inflame him.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al you will take into con&s;i|deration, and if you are able, upon &s;uch terms, to again meet my &s;on, we will wait upon you together, where and when you will appoint; but if the gentlene&s;s of your nature will make the effort too &s;evere for you, &s;cruple not to decline it, for Morti|mer,

when he knows your plea&s;ure, will &s;ubmit to it as he ought.</P>

<P>But yet, though repining at this hard nece&s;&s;ity, &s;he he&s;itated not a moment in complying with Mrs. Delvile's reque&s;t, and immediately &s;ent an an&s;wer that &s;he would meet her the next morning at Mrs. Charlton's.</P>

<P>Cecilia pa&s;&s;ed the night in planning her behaviour for the next day; &s;he found how much was expected from her by Mrs. Del|vile, who had even exhorted her to de|cline the interview if doubtful of her own &s;trength. Delvile's firmne&s;s in in&s;i&s;ting the refu&s;al &s;hould come directly from her|&s;elf, &s;urpri&s;ed, gratified and perplexed her in turn; &s;he had imagined, that from the moment of the di&s;covery, he would im|plicitly have &s;ubmitted to the award of a parent at once &s;o reverenced and &s;o be|loved, and how he had &s;ummoned courage to contend with her &s;he could not conjec|ture: yet that courage and that contention a&s;toni&s;hed not more than they &s;oothed her, &s;ince, from her knowledge of his filial ten|derne&s;s, &s;he con&s;idered them as the mo&s;t in|dubitable proofs &s;he had yet received of the fervour and con&s;tancy of his regard for her. But would he, when &s;he had ratified the deci&s;ion of his mother, forbear all further &s;truggle, and for ever yield up all preten&s;ions to her? this was the point upon which her uncertainty turned, and the ruling &s;ubject of her thoughts and me|ditation.</P>
<P>To be &s;teady, however, her&s;elf, be his

conduct what it might, was invariably her intention, and was all her ambition: yet earne&s;tly &s;he wi&s;hed the meeting over, for &s;he dreaded to &s;ee the &s;orrow of Delvile, and &s;he dreaded &s;till more the &s;u&s;ceptibility of her own heart.</P>
<P>The next morning, to her great con|cern, Mr. Arnott was waiting in the hall when &s;he came down &s;tairs, and &s;o much grieved at her departure, that he handed her to the chai&s;e without being able to &s;peak to her, and hardly heard her thanks and compliments but by recollection after &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>She arrived at Mrs. Charlton's very early, and found her old friend in the &s;ame &s;tate &s;he had left her. She communicated to her the purpo&s;e of her return, and begged &s;he would keep her grand daughters up &s;tairs, that the conference in the parlour might be uninterrupted and unheard.</P>
<P>She then made a forced and ha&s;ty break|fa&s;t, and went down to be ready to receive them. The came not till eleven o'clock, and the time of her waiting was pa&s;&s;ed in agonies of expectation.</P>
<P>At length they were announced, and at length they entered the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia, with her utmo&s;t efforts for cou|rage, could hardly &s;tand to receive them. They came in together, but Mrs. Delvile,
<PB N="253" REF="252">
advancing before her &s;on, and endeavour|ing &s;o to &s;tand as to intercept his view of her, with the hope that in a few in&s;tants her emotion would be le&s;s vi&s;ible, &s;aid, in the mo&s;t &s;oothing accents, <Q REND="inline">"What honour Mi&s;s Beverley does us by permitting this vi&s;it! I &s;hould have been &s;orry to have left Suffolk without the &s;atisfaction of again &s;eeing you; and my &s;on, &s;en&s;ible of the high re&s;pect he owes you, was mo&s;t unwil|ling to be gone, before he had paid you his devoirs."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia court&s;ied; but depre&s;&s;ed by the cruel ta&s;k which awaited her, had no power to &s;peak; and Mrs. Delvile, finding &s;he &s;till trembled, made her &s;it down, and drew a chair next to her.</P>
<P>Mean while Delvile, with an emotion far more violent, becau&s;e wholly unre|&s;trained, waited impatiently till the cere|monial of the reception was over, and then, approaching Cecilia, in a voice of pertur|bation and re&s;entment, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"In this pre|&s;ence, at lea&s;t, I hope I may be heard; though my letters have been unan&s;wered, my vi&s;its refu&s;ed, though inexorably you have flown me&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> interrupted Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"forget not that what I have told you is irrevocable; you now meet Mi&s;s Beverley for no other purpo&s;e than to give and to
<PB N="254" REF="253">
receive a mutual relea&s;e of all tie or en|gagement with each other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, madam,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"this is a condition to which I have never a&s;|&s;ented. I come not to relea&s;e, but to claim her! I am hers, and hers wholly! I pro|te&s;t it in the face of the world! The time, therefore, is now pa&s;t for the &s;acrifice which you demand, &s;ince &s;carce are you more my mother, than I con&s;ider her as my wife."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, amazed at this dauntle&s;s decla|ration, now almo&s;t lo&s;t her fear in her &s;urpri&s;e; while Mrs. Delvile, with an air calm though di&s;plea&s;ed, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"This is not a point to be at pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and I had hoped you knew better what was due to your auditors. I only con&s;ented to this interview as a mark of your re&s;pect for Mi&s;s Beverley, to whom in propriety it belongs to break off this unfortunate con|nexion."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who at this call could no longer be &s;ilent, now gathered fortitude to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever tie or obligation may be &s;up|po&s;ed to depend upon me, I have already relinqui&s;hed; and I am now ready to de|clare&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That you wholly give me up?"</Q> inter|rupted Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"is that what you would &s;ay?&mdash;Oh how have I offended you? how

have I merited a di&s;plea&s;ure that can draw upon me &s;uch a &s;entence?&mdash;An&s;wer, &s;peak to me, Cecilia, what is it I have done?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, con|founded at this language in the pre&s;ence of his mother, <Q REND="inline">"you have done nothing,&mdash;but yet&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet what?&mdash;have you conceived to me an aver&s;ion? has any dreadful and hor|rible antipathy &s;ucceeded to your e&s;teem?&mdash;tell, tell me without di&s;gui&s;e, do you hate, do you abhor me?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;ighed, and turned away her head; and Mrs. Delvile indignantly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What madne&s;s and ab&s;urdity! I &s;carce know you under the influence of &s;uch irrational violence. Why will you interrupt Mi&s;s Be|verley in the only &s;peech you ought to hear from her? Why, at once, oppre&s;s her, and irritate me, by words of more pa&s;&s;ion than rea&s;on? Go on, charming girl, fini&s;h what &s;o wi&s;ely, &s;o judiciou&s;ly you were beginning, and then you &s;hall be relea&s;ed from this turbulent per&s;ecution."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, madam, &s;he mu&s;t not go on!"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"if &s;he does not utterly abhor me, I will not <HI>&s;uffer</HI> her to go on;&mdash;Pardon, pardon me, Cecilia, but your too exqui&s;ite delicacy is betraying not only my happine&s;s, but your own. Once more, therefore, I conjure you to hear me, and
<PB N="256" REF="255">
then if, deliberately and unbia&s;&s;ed, you re|nounce me, I will never more di&s;tre&s;s you by re&s;i&s;ting your decree."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, aba&s;hed and changing colour, was &s;ilent, and he proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All that has pa&s;t between us, the vows I have offered you of faith, con&s;tancy and affection, the con&s;ent I obtained from you to be legally mine, the bond of &s;ettlement I have had drawn up, and the high honour you conferred upon me in &s;uffering me to lead you to the altar,&mdash;all the&s;e particulars are already known to &s;o many, that the lea&s;t reflection mu&s;t convince you they will &s;oon be concealed from none: tell me, then, if your own fame pleads not for me, and if the &s;cruples which lead you to refu&s;e, by taking another direction, will not, with much more propriety, urge, nay enjoin you to accept me?&mdash;You he&s;itate at lea&s;t,&mdash;O Mi&s;s Beverley!

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, nothing!"</Q> cried &s;he, ha&s;tily, and checking her ri&s;ing irre&s;olution; <Q REND="inline">"there is nothing for you to &s;ee, but that every way I now turn I have rendered my&s;elf mi&s;erable!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, &s;eized with terror as &s;he penetrated into the mental yielding of Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you have now &s;poken to Mi&s;s Beverley; and unwilling as
<PB N="257" REF="256">
I am to obtrude upon her our difference of &s;entiment, it is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince &s;he has heard you, that I, al&s;o, &s;hould claim her at|tention."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fir&s;t let her &s;peak!"</Q> cried Delvile, who in her apparent wavering built new hopes, <Q REND="inline">"fir&s;t let her an&s;wer what &s;he has already deigned to li&s;ten to."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, fir&s;t let her hear!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;o only can &s;he judge what an&s;wer will reflect upon her mo&s;t honour."</Q></P>
<P>Then, &s;olemnly turning to Cecilia, &s;he continued: <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee here, Mi&s;s Beverley, a young man who pa&s;&s;ionately adores you, and who forgets in his adoration friends, family, and connections, the opinions in which he has been educated, the honour of his hou&s;e, his own former views, and all his primitive &s;en&s;e of duty, both public and private!&mdash;A pa&s;&s;ion built on &s;uch a defal|cation of principle renders him unworthy your acceptance; and not more ignoble for him would be a union which would blot his name from the injured &s;tock whence he &s;prung, than indelicate for you, who upon &s;uch terms ought to de&s;pi&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heavens, madam,"</Q> exclaimed Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"what a &s;peech!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O never,"</Q> cried Cecilia, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"may I hear &s;uch another! Indeed, madam, there is no occa&s;ion to probe me &s;o deeply, for I
<PB N="258" REF="257">
would not now enter your family, for all that the whole world could offer me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At length, then, madam,"</Q> cried Del|vile, turning reproachfully to his mother, <Q REND="inline">"are you &s;atisfied? is your purpo&s;e now an&s;wered? and is the dagger you have transfixed in my heart &s;unk deep enough to appea&s;e you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O could I draw it out,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"and leave upon it no &s;tain of ignominy, with what joy &s;hould my own bo&s;om receive it, to heal the wound I have mo&s;t compul&s;atorily inflicted!&mdash;Were this excellent young creature portionle&s;s, I would not he&s;itate in giving my con&s;ent; every claim of intere&s;t would be over|balanced by her virtues, and I would not grieve to &s;ee you poor, where &s;o con&s;cious you were happy; but here to concede, would annihilate every hope with which hitherto I have looked up to my &s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let us now, then, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"break up this conference. I have &s;poken, I have heard, the decree is pa&s;t, and therefore,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are indeed an angel!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, ri&s;ing and embracing her; <Q REND="inline">"and never can I reproach my &s;on with what has pa&s;t, when I con&s;ider for what an object the &s;acrifice was planned. <HI>You</HI> cannot be un|happy, you have purcha&s;ed peace by the ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="259" REF="258">
of virtue, and the clo&s;e of every day will bring to you a reward, in the &s;weets of a &s;elf-approving mind.&mdash;But we will part, &s;ince you think it right; I do wrong to oc|ca&s;ion any delay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, we will <HI>not</HI> part!"</Q> cried Delvile, with encrea&s;ing vehemence; <Q REND="inline">"if you force me, madam, from her, you will drive me to di&s;traction! What is there in this world that can offer me a recompen&s;e? And what can pride even to the proude&s;t afford as an equivalent? Her perfections you acknow|ledge, her greatne&s;s of mind is like your own; &s;he has generou&s;ly given me her heart,&mdash;Oh &s;acred and fa&s;cinating charge! Shall I, after &s;uch a depo&s;ite, con&s;ent to an eternal &s;eparation? Repeal, repeal your &s;en|tence, my Cecilia! let us live to our&s;elves and our con&s;ciences, and leave the vain pre|judices of the world to tho&s;e who can be paid by them for the lo&s;s of all be&s;ides!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is this conflict, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"to la&s;t for-ever? Oh end it, Mor|timer, fini&s;h it, and make me happy! &s;he is ju&s;t, and will forgive you, &s;he is noble|minded, and will honour you. Fly, then, at this critical moment, for in flight alone is your &s;afety; and then will your father &s;ee the &s;on of his hopes, and then &s;hall the fond ble&s;&s;ings of your idolizing mother
<PB N="260" REF="259">
&s;oothe all your affliction, and &s;often all your regret!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh madam!"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"for mercy, for humanity, forbear this cruel &s;up|plication!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, more than &s;upplication, you have my commands; commands you have never yet di&s;puted, and mi&s;ery, ten-fold mi&s;ery, will follow their di&s;obedience. Hear me, Mortimer, for I &s;peak prophetically; I know your heart, I know it to be formed for rectitude and duty, or de&s;tined by their neglect to repentance and horror."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, &s;truck by the&s;e words, turned &s;uddenly from them both, and in gloomy de&s;pondence walked to the other end of the room. Mrs. Delvile perceived the moment of her power, and determined to pur&s;ue the blow: taking, therefore, the hand of Cecilia, while her eyes &s;parkled with the animation of reviving hope, <Q REND="inline">"See,"</Q> &s;he cried, pointing to her &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ee if I am de|ceived! can he bear even the &s;ugge&s;tion of future contrition? Think you when it falls upon him, he will &s;upport it better? No; he will &s;ink under it. And you, pure as you are of mind, and &s;tedfa&s;t in principle, what would your chance be of happine&s;s with a man who never erring till he knew you, could never look at you without re|gret, be his fondne&s;s what it might?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh madam,"</Q> cried the greatly &s;hocked Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"let him, then, &s;ee me no more!&mdash;take, take him all to your&s;elf! forgive, con&s;ole him! I will not have the mi&s;ery of involving him in repentance, nor of incurring the reproaches of the mother he &s;o much reverences!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Exalted creature!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"tenderne&s;s &s;uch as this would confer ho|nour upon a monarch."</Q> Then, calling out exultingly to her &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"See,"</Q> &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"how great a woman can act, when &s;timu|lated by genero&s;ity, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty! Follow then, at lea&s;t, the example you ought to have led, and de&s;erve my e&s;teem and love, or be content to forego them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can I only de&s;erve them,"</Q> &s;aid Delvile, in a tone of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, <Q REND="inline">"by a compliance to which not merely my happine&s;s, but my rea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;acrificed? What honour do I injure that is not facti|tious? What evil threatens our union, that is not imaginary? In the general commerce of the world it may be right to yield to its prejudices, but in matters of &s;erious im|portance, it is weakne&s;s to be &s;hackled by &s;cruples &s;o frivolous, and it is cowardly to be governed by the cu&s;toms we condemn. Religion and the laws of our country &s;hould then alone be con&s;ulted, and where tho&s;e are neither oppo&s;ed nor infringed, we &s;hould

<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;taken notions!"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile; <Q REND="inline">"and how long do you flatter your&s;elf this independant happine&s;s would endure? How long could you live contented by mere &s;elf|gratification, in defiance of the cen&s;ure of mankind, the renunciation of your family, and the cur&s;es of your father?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The cur&s;es of my father!"</Q> repeated he, &s;tarting and &s;huddering, <Q REND="inline">"O no, he could never be &s;o barbarous!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He could,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;teadily, <Q REND="inline">"nor do I doubt but he would. If now, how|ever, you are affected by the pro&s;pect of his di&s;claiming you, think but what you will feel when fir&s;t forbid to appear before either of us! and think of your remor&s;e for involving Mi&s;s Beverley in &s;uch di&s;grace!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O &s;peak not &s;uch words!"</Q> cried he, with agonizing earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"to di&s;grace her,&mdash;to be bani&s;hed by you,&mdash;pre&s;ent not, I conjure you, &s;uch &s;cenes to my ima|gination!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet would they be unavoidable,"</Q> con|tinued &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"nor have I &s;aid to you all; blinded as you now are by pa&s;&s;ion, your nobler feelings are only ob&s;cured, not extir|pated; think, then, how they will all ri&s;e in revenge of your in&s;ulted dignity, when your name becomes a &s;tranger to your ears,

and you are fir&s;t &s;aluted by one &s;o meanly adopted!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold, hold, madam,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"this is more than I can bear!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heavens!"</Q> &s;till continued &s;he, di&s;re|garding his entreaty, <Q REND="inline">"what in the uni|ver&s;e can pay you for that fir&s;t moment of indignity!

<P>Delvile, &s;tung to the &s;oul, attempted not any an&s;wer, but walked about the room in the utmo&s;t di&s;order of mind. Cecilia would have retired, but feared irritating him to &s;ome extravagance; and Mrs. Del|vile, looking after him, added <Q REND="inline">"For my|&s;elf, I would &s;till &s;ee, for I &s;hould pity your wife,&mdash;but NEVER would I behold my &s;on when &s;unk into an object of compa&s;|&s;ion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It &s;hall not be!"</Q> cried he, in a tran&s;|port of rage; <Q REND="inline">"cea&s;e, cea&s;e to di&s;tract me!&mdash;be content, madam,&mdash;you have con|quered!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you are my &s;on!"</Q> cried &s;he, rap|turou&s;ly embracing him; <Q REND="inline">"now I know
<PB N="264" REF="263">
again my Mortimer! now I &s;ee the fair pro|mi&s;e of his upright youth, and the flatter|ing completion of my maternal expecta|tions!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, finding all thus concluded, de|&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to congratulate them on their reconciliation; but having only &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Let <HI>me,</HI> too,&mdash;"</Q> her voice failed her, &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, and hoping &s;he had been unheard, would have glided out of the room.</P>
<P>But Delvile, penetrated and tortured, yet delighted at this &s;en&s;ibility, broke from his mother, and &s;eizing her hand, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh Mi&s;s Beverley, if <HI>you</HI> are not happy&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am! I am!"</Q> cried &s;he, with quick|ne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"let me pa&s;s,&mdash;and think no more of me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That voice,&mdash;tho&s;e looks,&mdash;"</Q> cried he, &s;till holding her, <Q REND="inline">"they &s;peak not &s;e|renity!&mdash;Oh if I have injured your peace,&mdash;if that heart, which, pure as angels, de|&s;erves to be as &s;acred from &s;orrow, through my means, or for my &s;ake, &s;uffers any di|minution of tranquility&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None, none!"</Q> interrupted &s;he, with precipitation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know well,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"your great|ne&s;s of &s;oul; and if this dreadful &s;acrifice gives la&s;ting torture only to my&s;elf,&mdash;if of

<HI>your</HI> returning happine&s;s I could be a&s;&s;ured,&mdash;I would &s;truggle to bear it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You <HI>may</HI> be a&s;&s;ured of it,"</Q> cried &s;he, with reviving dignity, <Q REND="inline">"I have no right to expect e&s;caping all calamity, but while I &s;hare the common lot, I will &s;ubmit to it without repining."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven then ble&s;s, and hovering an|gels watch you!"</Q> cried he, and letting go her hand, he ran ha&s;tily out of the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Virtue, how bright is thy tri|umph!"</Q> exclaimed Mrs. Delvile, flying up to Cecilia, and folding her in her arms; <Q REND="inline">"Noble, incomparable young creature! I knew not that &s;o much worth was compat|ible with human frailty!"</Q></P>
<P>But the heroi&s;m of Cecilia, in lo&s;ing its object, lo&s;t its force; &s;he &s;ighed, &s;he could not &s;peak, tears gu&s;hed into her eyes, and ki&s;&s;ing Mrs. Delvile's hand with a look that &s;hewed her inability to conver&s;e with her, &s;he ha&s;tened, though &s;carce able to &s;upport her&s;elf, away, with intention to &s;hut her&s;elf up in her own apartment: and Mrs. Delvile, who perceived that her utmo&s;t fortitude was exhau&s;ted, oppo&s;ed not her going, and wi&s;ely forebore to encrea&s;e her emotion, by following her even with her ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>But when &s;he came into the hall, &s;he &s;tarted, and could proceed no further; for there &s;he beheld Delvile, who in too great
<PB N="266" REF="265">
agony to be &s;een, had &s;topt to recover &s;ome compo&s;ure before he quitted the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ound of an opening door, he was ha&s;tily e&s;caping; but perceiving Ce|cilia, and di&s;cerning her &s;ituation, he more ha&s;tily turned back, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;To <HI>me</HI> were you coming?"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;hook her head, and made a motion with her hand to &s;ay no, and would then have gone on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are weeping!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you are pale!&mdash;Oh Mi&s;s Beverley! is this your happine&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very well,&mdash;"</Q> cried &s;he, not know|ing what &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I am quite well,&mdash;pray go,&mdash;I am very&mdash;"</Q> her words died away inarticulated.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh what a voice is that!"</Q> exclaimed he, <Q REND="inline">"it pierces my very &s;oul!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile now came to the parlour door, and looked agha&s;t at the &s;ituation in which &s;he &s;aw them: Cecilia again moved on, and reached the &s;tairs, but tottered, and was obliged to cling to the bani&s;ters.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O &s;uffer me to &s;upport you,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"you are not able to &s;tand,&mdash;whither is it you would go?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Any where,&mdash;I don't know,&mdash;"</Q> an|&s;wered &s;he, in faltering accents, <Q REND="inline">"but if you would leave me, I &s;hould be well."</Q></P>
<P>And, turning from him, &s;he walked again towards the parlour, finding by her &s;hak|ing
<PB N="267" REF="266">
frame, the impo&s;&s;ibility of getting un|aided up the &s;tairs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give me your hand, my love,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, cruelly alarmed by this re|turn; and the moment they re-entered the parlour, &s;he &s;aid impatiently to her &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Mortimer, why are you not gone?"</Q></P>
<P>He heard her not, however; his whole attention was upon Cecilia, who, &s;inking into a chair, hid her face again&s;t Mrs. Del|vile: but, reviving in a few moments, and blu&s;hing at the weakne&s;s &s;he had betrayed, &s;he rai&s;ed her head, and, with an a&s;&s;umed &s;erenity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am better,&mdash;much bet|ter,&mdash;I was rather &s;ick,&mdash;but it is over; and now, if you will excu&s;e me, I will go to my own room."</Q></P>
<P>She then aro&s;e, but her knees trembled, and her head was giddy, and again &s;eating her&s;elf, &s;he forced a faint &s;mile, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps I had better keep quiet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can I bear this!"</Q> cried Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"no, it &s;hakes all my re&s;olution!&mdash;lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t beloved Cecilia! forgive my ra&s;h de|claration, which I here retract and for&s;wear, and which no fal&s;e pride, no worthle&s;s va|nity &s;hall again &s;urpri&s;e from me!&mdash;rai&s;e, then, your eyes&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hot-headed young man!"</Q> interrupted Mrs. Delvile, with an air of haughty di&s;|plea&s;ure, <Q REND="inline">"if you cannot be rational, at
<PB N="268" REF="267">
lea&s;t be &s;ilent. Mi&s;s Beverley, we will both leave him."</Q></P>
<P>Shame, and her own earne&s;tne&s;s, now re&s;tored &s;ome &s;trength to Cecilia, who read with terror in the looks of Mrs. Delvile the pa&s;&s;ions with which &s;he was agitated, and in&s;tantly obeyed her by ri&s;ing; but her &s;on, who inherited a portion of her own &s;pirit, ru&s;hed between them both and the door, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Stay, madam, &s;tay! I can|not let you go: I &s;ee your intention, I &s;ee your dreadful purpo&s;e; you will work up|on the feelings of Mi&s;s Beverley, you will extort from her a promi&s;e to &s;ee me no more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oppo&s;e not my pa&s;&s;ing!"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, who&s;e voice, face and manner, &s;poke the encrea&s;ing di&s;turbance of her &s;oul; <Q REND="inline">"I have but too long talked to you in vain; I mu&s;t now take &s;ome better method for the &s;ecurity of the honour of my family."</Q></P>
<P>This moment appeared to Delvile deci|&s;ive; and ca&s;ting off in de&s;peration all ti|midity and re&s;traint, he &s;uddenly &s;prang forward, and &s;natching the hand of Cecilia from his mother, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot, I will not give her up!&mdash;nor now, madam, nor ever!&mdash;I prote&s;t it mo&s;t &s;olemnly! I af|firm it by my be&s;t hopes! I &s;wear it by all that I hold &s;acred!"</Q></P>
<P>Grief and horror next to frenzy at a di&s;|appointment thus unexpected, and thus
<PB N="269" REF="268">
peremptory, ro&s;e in the face of Mrs. Del|vile, who, &s;triking her hand upon her forehead, cried <Q REND="inline">"My brain is on fire!"</Q> and ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>Cecilia had now no difficulty to di&s;en|gage her&s;elf from Delvile, who, &s;hocked at the exclamation, and confounded by the &s;udden departure of his mother, ha&s;tened eagerly to pur&s;ue her: &s;he had only flown into the next parlour; but, upon following her thither, what was his dread and his alarm, when he &s;aw her extended upon the floor, her face, hands and neck all covered with blood! <Q REND="inline">"Great Heaven!"</Q> he ex|claimed, pro&s;trating him&s;elf by her &s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"what is it you have done!&mdash;where are you wounded?&mdash;what direful cur&s;e have you denounced again&s;t your &s;on!"</Q></P>
<P>Not able to &s;peak, &s;he angrily &s;hook her head, and indignantly made a motion with her hand, that commanded him from her &s;ight.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who had followed, though half dead with terror, had yet the pre&s;ence of mind to ring the bell. A &s;ervant came im|mediately; and Delvile, &s;tarting up from his mother, ordered him to fetch the fir&s;t &s;urgeon or phy&s;ician he could find.</P>
<P>The alarm now brought the re&s;t of the &s;ervants into the room, and Mrs. Delvile &s;uffered her&s;elf to be rai&s;ed from the ground,
<PB N="270" REF="269">
and &s;eated in a chair; &s;he was &s;till &s;ilent, but &s;hewed a di&s;gu&s;t to any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her &s;on, that made him deliver her into the hands of the &s;ervants, while, in &s;peechle&s;s agony, he only looked on and watched her.</P>
<P>Neither did Cecilia, though forgetting her own &s;orrow, and no longer &s;en&s;ible of per&s;onal weakne&s;s, venture to approach her: uncertain what had happened, &s;he yet con&s;idered her&s;elf as the ultimate cau&s;e of this dreadful &s;cene, and feared to ri&s;k the effect of the &s;malle&s;t additional emotion.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant returned with a &s;urgeon in a few minutes: Cecilia, unable to wait and hear what he would &s;ay, glided ha&s;tily out of the room; and Delvile, in &s;till greater agitation, followed her quick into the next parlour; but having eagerly advanced to &s;peak to her, he turned precipitately about, and hurrying into the hall, walked in ha&s;ty &s;teps up and down it, without courage to enquire what was pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>At length the &s;urgeon came out: Del|vile flew to him, and &s;topt him, but could a&s;k no que&s;tion. His countenance, how|ever, rendered words unnece&s;&s;ary; the &s;ur|geon under&s;tood him, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The lady will do very well; &s;he has bur&s;t a blood ve&s;&s;el, but I think it will be of no con&s;equence. She mu&s;t be kept quiet and
<PB N="271" REF="270">
ea&s;y, and upon no account &s;uffered to talk, or to u&s;e any exertion."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile now let him go, and flew him|&s;elf into a corner to return thanks to heaven that the evil, however great, was le&s;s than he had at fir&s;t apprehended. He then went into the parlour to Cecilia, ea|gerly calling out, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven be prai&s;ed, my mother has not voluntarily cur&s;ed me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O now then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"once more make her ble&s;s you! the violence of her agitation has already almo&s;t de&s;troyed her, and her frame is too weak for this &s;truggle of contending pa&s;&s;ions;&mdash;go to her, then, and calm the tumult of her &s;pirits, by acquie&s;cing wholly in her will, and being to her again the &s;on &s;he thinks &s;he has lo&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;aid he, in a tone of the deepe&s;t dejection; <Q REND="inline">"I have been preparing my&s;elf for that purpo&s;e, and waited but your commands to finally determine me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let us both go to her in&s;tantly,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the lea&s;t delay may be fatal."</Q></P>
<P>She now led the way, and approaching Mrs. Delvile, who, faint and weak, was &s;eated upon an arm chair, and re&s;ting her head upon the &s;houlder of a maid &s;ervant, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lean, deare&s;t madam, upon <HI>me,</HI> and &s;peak not, but hear us!"</Q></P>
<P>She then took the place of the maid, and
<PB N="272" REF="271">
de&s;ired her and the other &s;ervants to go out of the room. Delvile advanced, but his mother's eye, recovering, at his &s;ight, its wanted fire, darted upon him a glance of &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure, that, &s;huddering with the ap|prehen&s;ion of inflaming again tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which threatened her de&s;truction; he ha&s;tily &s;unk on one knee, and abruptly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Look at me with le&s;s abhorrence, for I come but to re&s;ign my&s;elf to your will."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mine, al&s;o,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that will &s;hall be; you need not &s;peak it, we know it, and here &s;olemnly we promi&s;e that we will &s;eparate for ever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Revive, then, my mother,"</Q> &s;aid Del|vile, <Q REND="inline">"rely upon our plighted honours, and think only of your health, for your &s;on will never more offend you."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Delvile, much &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;trongly affected, held out her hand to him, with a look of mingled compa&s;&s;ion and obligation, and dropping her head upon the bo&s;om of Cecilia, who with her other arm &s;he pre&s;&s;ed towards her, &s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Go, go, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, cruelly alarmed, <Q REND="inline">"you have &s;aid all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary; leave Mrs. Delvile now, and &s;he will be more compo&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile in&s;tantly obeyed, and then his mother, who&s;e mouth &s;till continued to fill
<PB N="273" REF="272">
with blood, though it gu&s;hed not from her with the violence it had begun, was pre|vailed upon by the prayers of Cecilia to con&s;ent to be conveyed into her room; and, as her immediate removal to another hou&s;e might be dangerous, &s;he complied al&s;o, though very reluctantly, with her urgent entreaties, that &s;he would take entire po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till the next day.</P>
<P>This point gained, Cecilia left her, to communicate what had pa&s;t to Mrs. Charl|ton; but was told by one of the &s;ervants, that Mr. Delvile begged fir&s;t to &s;peak with her in the next room.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated for a moment whether to grant this reque&s;t; but recollecting it was right to acquaint him with his mother's intention of &s;taying all night, &s;he went to him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How indulgent you are,"</Q> cried he, in a melancholy voice as &s;he opened the door; <Q REND="inline">"I am now going po&s;t to Dr. Ly&s;ter, whom I &s;hall entreat to come hither in|&s;tantly; but I am fearful of again di&s;turbing my mother, and mu&s;t therefore rely upon you to acquaint her what is become of me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t certainly; I have begged her to remain here to night, and I hope I &s;hall prevail with her to continue with me till Dr. Ly&s;ter's arrival; after which &s;he will, doubtle&s;s, be guided either in &s;taying
<PB N="274" REF="273">
longer, or removing el&s;ewhere, by his advice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are all goodne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh; <Q REND="inline">"and how I &s;hall &s;upport&mdash;but I mean not to return hither, at lea&s;t not to this hou&s;e,&mdash;unle&s;s, indeed, Dr. Ly&s;|ter's account &s;hould be alarming. I leave my mother, therefore, to your kindne&s;s, and only hope, only entreat, that your own health,&mdash;your own peace of mind&mdash;neither by attendance upon her&mdash;by anxiety&mdash;by pity for her &s;on&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, and &s;eemed ga&s;ping for breath; Cecilia turned from him to hide her emo|tion, and he proceeded with a rapidity of &s;peech that &s;hewed his terror of continuing with her any longer, and his &s;truggle with him&s;elf to be gone: <Q REND="inline">"The promi&s;e you have made in both our names to my mother, I &s;hall hold my&s;elf bound to ob|&s;erve. I &s;ee, indeed, that her rea&s;on or her life would fall the &s;acrifice of further oppo&s;ition: of my&s;elf, therefore, it is no longer time to think.&mdash;I take of you no leave&mdash;I cannot! yet I would fain tell you the high reverence&mdash;but it is better to &s;ay nothing&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Much better,"</Q> cried Cecilia, with a forced and faint &s;mile; <Q REND="inline">"lo&s;e not, there|fore, an in&s;tant, but ha&s;ten to this good Dr. Ly&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="274">
<Q REND="inline">"I will;"</Q> an&s;wered he, going to the door; but there, &s;topping and turning round, <Q REND="inline">"one thing I &s;hould yet,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"wi&s;h to &s;ay,&mdash;I have been impe|tuous, violent, unrea&s;onable,&mdash;with &s;hame and with regret I recollect how impe|tuous, and how unrea&s;onable: I have per&s;ecuted, where I ought in &s;ilence to have &s;ubmitted; I have reproached, where I ought in candour to have approved; and in the vehemence with which I have pur|&s;ued you, I have cen&s;ured that very dignity of conduct which has been the ba&s;is of my admiration, my e&s;teem, my devotion! but never can I forget, and never without fre&s;h wonder remember, the &s;weetne&s;s with which you have borne with me, even when mo&s;t I offended you. For this impatience, this violence, this incon&s;i&s;tency, I now mo&s;t &s;incerely beg your pardon; and if, before I go, you could &s;o far conde&s;cend as to pro|nounce my forgivene&s;s, with a lighter heart, I think, I &s;hould quit you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not talk of forgivene&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"you have never offended me; I al|ways knew&mdash;always was &s;ure&mdash;always imputed&mdash;"</Q> &s;he &s;topt, unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Deeply penetrated by her apparent di|&s;tre&s;s, he with difficulty re&s;trained him&s;elf from falling at her feet; but after a mo|ment's pau&s;e and recollection, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="276" REF="275">
under&s;tand the generous indulgence you have &s;hewn me, an indulgence I &s;hall ever revere, and ever grieve to have abu&s;ed. I a&s;k you not to remember me,&mdash;far, far happier do I wi&s;h you than &s;uch a remem|brance could make you; but I will pain the humanity of your di&s;po&s;ition no longer. You will tell my mother&mdash;but no matter!&mdash;Heaven pre&s;erve you, my angelic Ceci|lia!&mdash;Mi&s;s Beverley, I mean,&mdash;Heaven guide, protect, and ble&s;s you! And &s;hould I &s;ee you no more, &s;hould this be the la&s;t &s;ad moment&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, but pre&s;ently recovering him&s;elf, added, <Q REND="inline">"May I hear, at lea&s;t, of your tranquillity, for that alone can have any chance to quiet or repre&s;s the angui&s;h I feel here!"</Q></P>
<P>He then abruptly retreated, and ran out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Cecilia for a while remained almo&s;t &s;tu|pified with &s;orrow; &s;he forgot Mrs. Del|vile, &s;he forgot Mrs. Charlton, &s;he forgot her own de&s;ign of apologizing to one, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting the other: &s;he continued in the po&s;ture in which he had left her, quite without motion, and almo&s;t without &s;en|&s;ibility.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A MESSAGE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this lethargy of &s;adne&s;s Cecilia was &s;oon, however, awakened by the return of the &s;urgeon, who had brought with him a phy&s;ician to con&s;ult upon Mrs. Delvile's &s;ituation. Terror for the mother once more drove the &s;on from her thoughts, and &s;he waited with the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive impatience to hear the re&s;ult of the con|&s;ultation. The phy&s;ician declined giving any po&s;itive opinion, but, having written a pre&s;cription, only repeated the injunction of the &s;urgeon, that &s;he &s;hould be kept extremely quiet, and on no account be &s;uffered to talk.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;hocked and frighened at the occa&s;ion, was yet by no means &s;orry at an order which thus precluded all con|ver&s;ation; unfitted for it by her own mi|&s;ery, &s;he was glad to be relieved from all nece&s;&s;ity of impo&s;ing upon her&s;elf the irk|&s;ome ta&s;k of finding &s;ubjects for di&s;cour&s;e to which &s;he was wholly indifferent, while
<PB N="278" REF="277">
obliged with &s;edulity to avoid tho&s;e by which alone her mind was occupied.</P>
<P>The worthy Mrs. Charlton heard the events of the morning with the utmo&s;t concern, but charged her grand-daughters to a&s;&s;i&s;t her young friend in doing the ho|nours of her hou&s;e to Mrs. Delvile, while &s;he ordered another apartment to be pre|pared for Cecilia, to whom &s;he admini|&s;tered all the con&s;olation her friendly zeal could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Cecilia, however unhappy, had too ju&s;t a way of thinking to indulge in &s;elfi&s;h grief, where occa&s;ion called her to action for the benefit of others: &s;carce a moment, therefore now did &s;he allow to &s;orrow and her&s;elf, but a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly be&s;towed the whole of her time upon her two &s;ick friends, di|viding her attention according to their own de&s;ire or convenience, without con&s;ulting or regarding any choice of her own. Choice, indeed, &s;he had none; &s;he loved Mrs. Charlton, &s;he revered Mrs. Delvile; the warme&s;t wi&s;h with which her heart glowed, was the recovery of both, but too deep was her affliction to receive plea&s;ure from either.</P>
<P>Two days pa&s;&s;ed thus, during which the con&s;tancy of her attendance, which at ano|ther time would have fatigued her, proved the only relief &s;he was capable of receiving.
<PB N="279" REF="278">
Mrs. Delvile was evidently affected by her vigilant tenderne&s;s, but &s;eemed equally de|&s;irous with her&s;elf to make u&s;e of the pro|hibition to &s;peech as an excu&s;e for unin|terrupted &s;ilence. She enquired not even after her &s;on, though the eagerne&s;s of her look towards the door whenever it was opened, &s;hewed either a hope, or an ap|prehen&s;ion that he might enter. Cecilia wi&s;hed to tell her whither he was gone, but dreaded tru&s;ting her voice with his name; and their &s;ilence, after a while, &s;eemed &s;o much by mutual con&s;ent, that &s;he had &s;oon as little courage as &s;he had inclination to break it.</P>
<P>The arrival of Dr. Ly&s;ter gave her much &s;atisfaction, for upon him re&s;ted her hopes of Mrs. Delvile's re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. He &s;ent for her down &s;tairs, to enquire whether he was expected; and hearing that he was not, de&s;ired her to announce him, as the &s;malle&s;t emotion might do mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>She returned up &s;tairs, and after a &s;hort preparation, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your favourite Dr. Ly&s;ter, madam, is come, and I &s;hall be much the happier for having you under his care."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dr. Ly&s;ter?"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"who &s;ent for him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe&mdash;I fancy&mdash;Mr. Delvile fetched him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="279">
<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on?&mdash;is he here, then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;he went, the moment he left you, for Dr. Ly&s;ter,&mdash;and Dr. Ly&s;ter is come by him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Does he write to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed!&mdash;he writes not&mdash;he comes not&mdash;deare&s;t madam be &s;atisfied, he will do neither to <HI>me</HI> ever more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Exemplary young man!"</Q> cried &s;he, in a voice hardly audible, <Q REND="inline">"how great is his lo&s;s!&mdash;unhappy Mortimer!&mdash;ill-fated, and ill-rewarded!"</Q></P>
<P>She &s;ighed, and &s;aid no more; but this &s;hort conver&s;ation, the only one which had pa&s;&s;ed between them &s;ince her illne&s;s, agi|tated her &s;o much, that Dr. Ly&s;ter, who now came up &s;tairs, found her in a &s;tate of trembling and weakne&s;s that both alarmed and &s;urpri&s;ed him. Cecilia, glad of an op|portunity to be gone, left the room, and &s;ent, by Dr. Ly&s;ter's de&s;ire, for the phy|&s;ician and &s;urgeon who had already at|tended.</P>
<P>After they had been &s;ome time with their patient, they retired to a con&s;ultation, and when it was over, Dr. Ly&s;ter waited upon Cecilia in the parlour, and a&s;&s;ured her he had no apprehen&s;ion of danger for Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"Though, for another week, he added, I would have her continue <HI>your</HI> pa|tient, as &s;he is not yet fit to be removed.
<PB N="281" REF="280">
But pray mind that &s;he is kept quiet; let nobody go near her, not even her own &s;on. By the way he is waiting for me at the inn, &s;o I'll ju&s;t &s;peak again to his mother, and be gone."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was well plea&s;ed by this acciden|tal information, to learn both the anxiety of Delvile for his mother, and the &s;teadi|ne&s;s of his forbearance for him&s;elf. When Dr. Ly&s;ter came down &s;tairs again, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;tay,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"till to-morrow, but I hope &s;he will be able in another week to get to Bri&s;tol. In the mean time I &s;hall leave her, I &s;ee, with an excellent nur&s;e. But, my good young lady, in your care of her, don't neglect your&s;elf; I am not quite plea&s;ed with your looks, though it is but an old fa&s;hioned &s;peech to tell you &s;o.&mdash;What have you been doing to your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, a little embar|ra&s;&s;ed; <Q REND="inline">"but had you not better have &s;ome tea?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why yes, I think I had;&mdash;but what &s;hall I do with my young man?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia under&s;tood the hint, but co|loured, and made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is waiting for me,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"at the inn; however, I never yet knew the young man I would prefer to a young woman; &s;o if you will give me &s;ome tea here, I &s;hall certainly jilt him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="281">
Cecilia in&s;tantly rang the bell, and or|dered tea.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well now,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"remember the &s;in of this breach of appointment lies wholly at your door.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I think I mu&s;t <HI>un</HI>order the tea,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with what gaiety &s;he could a&s;&s;ume," <Q REND="inline">"if I am to be re&s;pon&s;ible for any mi&s;chief from your drinking it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, you &s;han't be off now; but pray would it be quite out of rule for you to &s;end and a&s;k him to come to us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I believe&mdash;I think&mdash;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;tammering, <Q REND="inline">"it's very likely he may be engaged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, I don't mean to propo&s;e any violent incongruity. You mu&s;t excu&s;e my blundering; I under&s;tand but little of the <HI>etiquette</HI> of young ladies. 'Tis a &s;cience too intricate to be learned without more &s;tudy than we plodding men of bu&s;ine&s;s can well &s;pare time for. However, when I have done <HI>writing</HI> pre&s;criptions, I will &s;et about <HI>reading</HI> them, provided you will be my in|&s;tructre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though a&s;hamed of a charge in which prudery and affectation were implied,
<PB N="283" REF="282">
was compelled to &s;ubmit to it, as either to &s;end for Delvile, or explain her objections, was equally impo&s;&s;ible. The Mi&s;s Charl|tons, therefore, joined them, and they went to tea.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they had done, a note was deli|vered to Dr. Ly&s;ter; <Q REND="inline">"See here,"</Q> cried he, when he had read it, <Q REND="inline">"what a fine thing it is to be a <HI>young</HI> man! Why now, Mr. Mortimer under&s;tands as much of all this <HI>etiquette</HI> as you ladies do your&s;elves; for he only writes a note even to a&s;k how his mother does."</Q></P>
<P>He then put it into Cecilia's hand.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Dr. LYSTER.</HEAD>
<P>TELL me, my dear Sir, how you have found my mother? I am unea&s;y at your long &s;tay, and engaged with my friend Biddulph, or I &s;hould have followed you in per&s;on.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>M. D.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So you &s;ee,"</Q> continued the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"I need not do pennance for engaging my&s;elf to <HI>you,</HI> when this young gentleman can find &s;uch good entertainment for him|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who well knew the honourable motive of Delvile's engagement, with dif|ficulty
<PB N="284" REF="283">
forbore &s;peaking in his vindication. Dr. Ly&s;ter immediately began an an&s;wer, but before he had fini&s;hed it, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Now as I am told you are a very good young woman, I think you can do no le&s;s than a&s;&s;i&s;t me to puni&s;h this gay &s;park, for playing the <HI>macaroni,</HI> when he aught to vi&s;it his &s;ick mother."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, much hurt for Delvile, and much confu&s;ed for her&s;elf, looked aba&s;hed, but knew not what to an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;cheme,"</Q> continued the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"is to tell him, that as he has found one engagement for tea, he may find another for &s;upper; but that as to me, I am better di&s;po&s;ed of, for you in&s;i&s;t upon keeping me to your&s;elf. Come, what &s;ays <HI>etiquette?</HI> may I treat my&s;elf with this puff?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, endeavour|ing to look plea&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"if you will favour us with your company, Mi&s;s Charltons and my&s;elf will think the <HI>puffing</HI> &s;hould rather be ours than yours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, then,"</Q> &s;aid the doctor, <Q REND="inline">"will not an&s;wer my purpo&s;e, for I mean the puff to be my own, or how do I puni&s;h him? So, &s;uppo&s;e I tell him I &s;hall not only &s;up with three young ladies, but be invited to a t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te with one of them into the bar|gain?"</Q></P>
<P>The young ladies only laughed, and the Dr. fini&s;hed his note, and &s;ent it away; and
<PB N="285" REF="284">
then, turning gayly to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"why don't you give me this in|vitation? &s;urely you don't mean to make me guilty of perjury?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, but little di&s;po&s;ed for plea&s;antry, would gladly now have dropt the &s;ubject; but Dr. Ly&s;ter, turning to the Mi&s;s Charltons, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Young ladies, I call you both to witne&s;s if this is not very bad u&s;age: this young woman has connived at my writing a downright fal&s;ehood, and all the time took me in to believe it was a truth. The only way I can think of to cure her of &s;uch frolics, is for both of you to leave us to|gether, and &s;o make her keep her word whether &s;he will or no."</Q></P>
<P>The Mi&s;s Charltons took the hint, and went away; while Cecilia, who had not at all &s;u&s;pected he meant &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;peak with her, remained extremely perplexed to think what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Delvile,"</Q> cried he, continuing the &s;ame air of ea&s;y good humour, <Q REND="inline">"though I allowed her not to &s;peak to me above twenty words, took up near ten of them to tell me that you had behaved to her like an angel. Why &s;o &s;he ought, cried I; what el&s;e was &s;he &s;ent for here to look &s;o like one? I charged her, therefore, to take all that as a thing of cour&s;e; and to prove that
<PB N="286" REF="285">
I really think what I &s;ay, I am now going to make a trial of you, that, if you are any thing le&s;s, will induce you to order &s;ome of your men to drive me into the &s;treet. The truth is, I have had a little commi&s;&s;ion given me, which in the fir&s;t place I know not how to introduce, and which, in the &s;econd, as far as I can judge, appears to be ab&s;olutely &s;uperfluous."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now felt unea&s;y and alarmed, and begged him to explain him&s;elf. He then dropt the levity with which he had begun the di&s;cour&s;e, and after a grave, yet gentle preparation, expre&s;&s;ive of his unwillingne&s;s to di&s;tre&s;s her, and his firm per&s;ua&s;ion of her uncommon worthine&s;s, he acquainted her that he was no &s;tranger to her &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the Delvile family.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> cried &s;he, blu&s;hing and much amazed; <Q REND="inline">"and who&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew it,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"from the mo|ment I attended Mr. Mortimer in his ill|ne&s;s at Delvile-Ca&s;tle. He could not con|ceal from me that the &s;eat of his di&s;order was his mind; and I could not know that, without readily conjecturing the cau&s;e, when I &s;aw who was his father's gue&s;t, and when I knew what was his father's character. He found he was betrayed to me, and upon my advi&s;ing a journey, he under&s;tood me properly. His openne&s;s to coun&s;el, and the
<PB N="287" REF="286">
manly firmne&s;s with which he behaved in quitting you, made me hope the danger was blown over. But la&s;t week, when I was at the Ca&s;tle, where I have for &s;ome time attended Mr. Delvile, who has had a &s;evere fit of the gout, I found him in an agitation of &s;pirits that made me apprehend it would be thrown into his &s;tomach. I de&s;ired Mrs. Delvile to u&s;e her influence to calm him; but &s;he was her&s;elf in &s;till greater emotion, and acquainting me &s;he was obliged to leave him, de&s;ired I would &s;pend with him every moment in my power. I have therefore almo&s;t lived at the Ca&s;tle during her ab&s;ence, and, in the cour&s;e of our many conver&s;ations, he has acknow|ledged to me the unea&s;ine&s;s under which he laboured, from the intelligence concerning his &s;on, which he had ju&s;t received."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia wi&s;hed here to enquire <HI>how</HI> re|ceived, and from whom, but had not the courage, and therefore he proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was &s;till with the father when Mr. Mortimer arrived po&s;t at my hou&s;e to fetch me hither. I was &s;ent for home; he in|formed me of his errand without di&s;gui&s;e, for he knew I was well acquainted with the original &s;ecret whence all the evil aro&s;e. I told him my di&s;tre&s;s in what manner to leave his father; and he was extremely
<PB N="288" REF="287">
&s;hocked him&s;elf when acquainted with his &s;ituation. We agreed that it would be vain to conceal from him the indi&s;po&s;ition of Mrs. Delvile, which the delay of her re|turn, and a thou&s;and other accidents, might in &s;ome unfortunate way make known to him. He commi&s;&s;ioned me, therefore, to break it to him, that he might con&s;ent to my journey, and at the &s;ame time to quiet his own mind, by a&s;&s;uring him all he had ap|prehended was wholly at an end."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt, and looked to &s;ee how Cecilia bore the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It <HI>is</HI> all at an end, Sir;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with firmne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"but I have not yet heard your commi&s;&s;ion; what, and from whom is that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am thoroughly &s;atisfied it is unnece&s;|&s;ary;"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince the young man can but &s;ubmit, and you can but give him up."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But &s;till, if there is a me&s;&s;age, it is fit I &s;hould hear it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you chu&s;e it, &s;o it is. I told Mr. Delvile whither I was coming, and I re|peated to him his &s;on's a&s;&s;urances. He was relieved, but not &s;atisfied; he would not &s;ee him, and gave me for him a prohibition of extreme &s;everity,&mdash;and to <HI>you</HI> he bid me &s;ay&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From <HI>him,</HI> then, is my me&s;&s;age?"</Q>
<PB N="289" REF="288">
cried Cecilia, half frightened, and much di&s;appointed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid he, under&s;tanding her im|mediately, <Q REND="inline">"for the &s;on, after giving me his fir&s;t account, had the wi&s;dom and for|bearance not once to mention you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very glad,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, with a mix|ture of admiration and regret, <Q REND="inline">"to hear it. But, what, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Delvile?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He bid me tell you that either <HI>he,</HI> or <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t &s;ee his &s;on never more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was indeed unnece&s;&s;ary,"</Q> cried &s;he, colouring with re&s;entment, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;end me &s;uch a me&s;&s;age. I meant not to &s;ee him again, he meant not to de&s;ire it. I return him, however, no an&s;wer, and I will make him no promi&s;e; to Mrs. Delvile alone I hold my&s;elf bound; to him, &s;end what me&s;|&s;ages he may, I &s;hall always hold my&s;elf free. But believe me, Dr. Ly&s;ter, if with his name, his &s;on had inherited his cha|racter, his de&s;ire of our &s;eparation would be feeble, and trifling, compared with my own!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, my good young lady,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to have given you this di&s;turb|ance; yet I admire your &s;pirit, and doubt not but it will enable you to forget any little di&s;appointment you may have &s;uffered. And what, after all, have you to regret? Mortimer Delvile is, indeed, a young man that any woman might wi&s;h to attach; but
<PB N="290" REF="289">
every woman cannot have him, and you, of all women, have lea&s;t rea&s;on to repine in mi&s;&s;ing him, for &s;carcely is there another man you may not chu&s;e or reject at your plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>Little as was the con&s;olation Cecilia could draw from this &s;peech, &s;he was &s;en|&s;ible it became not her &s;ituation to make complaints, and therefore, to end the con|ver&s;ation, &s;he propo&s;ed calling in the Mi&s;s Charltons.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t &s;tep up again to Mrs. Delvile, and then be-gone. To-morrow morning I &s;hall but call to &s;ee how &s;he is, and leave &s;ome directions, and &s;et off. Mr. Mortimer Delvile accom|panies me back: but he means to return hither in a week, in order to travel with his mother to Bri&s;tol. Mean time, I purpo&s;e to bring about a reconciliation between him and his father, who&s;e prejudices are more intractable than any man's I ever met with."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It will be &s;trange indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould a reconciliation <HI>now</HI> be diffi|cult!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True; but it is long &s;ince he was young him&s;elf, and the &s;ofter affections he never was acquainted with, and only re|gards them in his &s;on as derogatory to his whole race. However, if there were not &s;ome few &s;uch men, there would hardly be
<PB N="291" REF="290">
a family in the kingdom that could count a great grand-father. I am not, I mu&s;t own, of his humour my&s;elf, but I think it rather peculiarly &s;tranger, than peculiarly wor&s;e than mo&s;t other peoples; and how, for ex|ample, was that of <HI>your</HI> uncle a whit the better? He was ju&s;t as fond of <HI>his</HI> name, as if, like Mr. Delvile, he could trace it from the time of the Saxons."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;trongly felt the truth of this ob|&s;ervation, but not chu&s;ing to di&s;cu&s;s it, made not any an&s;wer, and Dr. Ly&s;ter, after a few good-natured apologies, both for his friends the Delvile's and him&s;elf, went up &s;tairs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What continual di&s;turbance,"</Q> cried &s;he, when left alone, <Q REND="inline">"keeps me thus for|ever from re&s;t! no &s;ooner is one wound clo&s;ed, but another is opened; mortification con&s;tantly &s;ucceeds di&s;tre&s;s, and when my heart is &s;pared, my pride is attacked, that not a moment of tranquility may ever be allowed me! Had the lowe&s;t of women won the affections of Mr. Delvile, could his father with le&s;s delicacy or le&s;s decency have acquainted her with his inflexible di&s;appro|bation? To &s;end with &s;o little ceremony a me&s;&s;age &s;o contemptuous and &s;o preremp|tory!&mdash;but perhaps it is better, for had he, too, like Mrs. Delvile, joined kindne&s;s with rejection, I might &s;till more keenly have felt the perver&s;ene&s;s of my de&s;tiny."</Q></P>

<PB N="292" REF="291">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A PARTING.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Dr. Ly&s;ter called early, and having vi&s;ited Mrs. Delvile, and again met the two gentlemen of the fa|culty in who&s;e care &s;he was to remain, he took his leave. But not without contriving fir&s;t to &s;peak a few words to Cecilia in pri|vate, in which he charged her to be careful of her health, and re-animate her &s;pirits. <Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;uppo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that becau&s;e I am a friend of the Delvile family, I am either blind to your merits, or to their foibles, far from it; but then why &s;hould they interfere with one another? Let them keep their prejudices, which, though differ|ent, are not wor&s;e than their neighbours, and do you retain your excellencies, and draw from them the happine&s;s which they ought to give you. People rea&s;on and re|fine them&s;elves into a thou&s;and mi&s;eries, by chu&s;ing to &s;ettle that they can only be con|tented one way; whereas, there are fifty ways, if they would but look about them, that would commonly do as well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, indeed, you are right,"</Q> an|&s;wered
<PB N="293" REF="292">
Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"and I thank you for the admonition; I will do what I can towards &s;tudying your &s;cheme of philo&s;ophy, and it is always one &s;tep to amendment, to be convinced that we want it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are a &s;en&s;ible and charming girl,"</Q> &s;aid Dr. Ly&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"and Mr. Delvile, &s;hould he find a daughter-in-law de&s;cended in a right line from Egbert, fir&s;t king of all England, won't be &s;o well off as if he had &s;atisfied him&s;elf with you. However, the old gentleman has a fair right, after all, to be plea&s;ed his own way, and let us blame him how we will, we &s;hall find, upon &s;ift|ing, it is for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e his humour happens to cla&s;h with our own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"is a truth incontrovertable! and a truth to which, for the future, I will endeavour to give more weight. But will you permit me now to a&s;k one que&s;tion?&mdash;Can you tell me from whom, how, or when the intelli|gence which has cau&s;ed all this di&s;turb|ance&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She he&s;itated, but, comprehending her readily, he an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"How they got at it, I never heard, for I never thought it worth while to enquire, as it is &s;o generally known, that nobody I meet with &s;eems ig|norant of it."</Q></P>
<P>This was another, and a cruel &s;hock to
<PB N="294" REF="293">
Cecilia, and Dr. Ly&s;ter, peceiving it, again attempted to comfort her. <Q REND="inline">"That the af|fair is &s;omewhat &s;pread,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"is now not to be helped, and therefore little worth thinking of; every body will agree that the choice of both does honour to both, and nobody need be a&s;hamed to be &s;ucce&s;&s;or to either, whenever the cour&s;e of things leads Mr. Mortimer and your&s;elf to make another election. He wi&s;ely intends to go abroad, and will not return till he is his own man again. And as to you, my good young lady, what, after a &s;hort time given to vexation, need interrupt your happine&s;s? You have the whole world before you, with youth, fortune, talents, beauty and inde|pendence; drive, therefore, from your head this unlucky affair, and remember there can hardly be a family in the kingdom, this one excepted, that will not rejoice in a con|nection with you."</Q></P>
<P>He then good-humouredly &s;hook hands with her, and went into his chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though not &s;low in remarking the ea&s;e and philo&s;ophy with which every one can argue upon the calamities, and mora|lize upon the mi&s;conduct of others, had &s;till the candour and good &s;en&s;e to &s;ee that there was rea&s;on in what he urged, and to re&s;olve upon making the be&s;t u&s;e in her
<PB N="295" REF="294">
power of the hints for con&s;olation &s;he might draw from his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>During the following week, &s;he devoted her&s;elf almo&s;t wholly to Mrs. Delvile, &s;har|ing with the maid, whom &s;he had brought with her from the Ca&s;tle, the fatigue of nur&s;ing her, and leaving to the Mi&s;s Charl|tons the chief care of their grand-mother. For Mrs. Delvile appeared every hour more &s;en&s;ible of her attention, and more de&s;ir|ous of her pre&s;ence, and though neither of them &s;poke, each was endeared to the other by the tender offices of friend&s;hip which were paid and received.</P>
<P>When this week was expired, Dr. Ly&s;ter was prevailed upon to return again to Bury, in order to travel him&s;elf with Mrs. Delvile to Bri&s;tol. <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried he, tak|ing Cecilia by the fir&s;t opportunity a&s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"how are you? Have you &s;tudied my &s;cheme of philo&s;ophy, as you promi&s;ed me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and made, I flat|ter my&s;elf, no little proficiency."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are a good girl,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"a very extraordinary girl! I am &s;ure you are; and upon my honour I pity poor Mortimer with all my &s;oul! But he is a noble young fellow, and behaves with a courage and &s;pi|rit that does me good to behold. To have obtained you, he would have moved heaven
<PB N="296" REF="295">
and earth, but finding you out of his reach, he &s;ubmits to his fate like a man."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia's eyes gli&s;tened at this &s;peech; <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"he long &s;ince &s;aid 'tis &s;u&s;pence, 'tis hope, that make the mi&s;ery of life,&mdash;for there the Pa&s;&s;ions have all power, and Rea&s;on has none. But when evils are irremediable, and we have neither re&s;ources to plan, nor ca&s;tle-building to delude us, we find time for the cultivation of philo|&s;ophy, and flatter our&s;elves, perhaps, that we have found inclination!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you have con&s;idered this matter very deeply,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"but I mu&s;t not have you give way to the&s;e &s;erious reflec|tions. Thought, after all, has a cruel &s;pite again&s;t happine&s;s; I would have you, therefore, keep as much as you conveni|ently can, out of its company. Run about and divert your&s;elf, 'tis all you have for it. The true art of happine&s;s in this mo&s;t whim|&s;ical world, &s;eems nothing more nor le&s;s than this&mdash;Let tho&s;e who have lei&s;ure, find employment, and tho&s;e who have bu&s;ine&s;s, find lei&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>He then told her that Mr. Delvile &s;enior was much better, and no longer confined to his room: and that he had had the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing an entire reconciliation take place between him and his &s;on, of whom
<PB N="297" REF="296">
he was more fond and more proud than any other father in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Think of him, however, my dear young lady,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"no more, for the matter I &s;ee is de&s;perate: you mu&s;t pardon my being a little officious, when I confe&s;s to you I could not help propo&s;ing to the old gentleman an expedient of my own; for as I could not drive you out of my head, I employed my&s;elf in thinking what might be done by way of accommodation. Now my &s;cheme was really a very good one, only when people are prejudiced, all rea&s;on|ing is thrown away upon them I propo&s;ed &s;inking <HI>both</HI> your names, &s;ince they are &s;o at variance with one another, and &s;o adopt|ing a third, by means of a title. But Mr. Delvile angrily declared, that though &s;uch a &s;cheme might do very well for the needy Lord Ernolf, a Peer of twenty years, his own noble ance&s;tors &s;hould never, by his con&s;ent, forfeit a name which &s;o many cen|turies had rendered honourable. His &s;on Mortimer, he added, mu&s;t inevitably in|herit the title of his grandfather, his uncle being old and unmarried; but yet he would rather &s;ee him a beggar, than lo&s;e his dear|e&s;t hope that <HI>Delvile,</HI> Lord <HI>Delvile,</HI> would de&s;cend, both name and title, from gener|ation to generation un&s;ullied and uninter|rupted."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="297">
<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;uch a propo&s;al was made, and I ear|ne&s;tly entreat that none of any &s;ort may be repeated."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I would not for the world do any mi&s;chief, but who would not have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch a propo&s;al would have done good?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Mortimer,"</Q> he then added, <Q REND="inline">"is to meet us at &mdash; for he would not, he &s;aid, come again to this place, upon &s;uch terms as he was here la&s;t week, for the whole worth of the king's dominions."</Q></P>
<P>The carriage was now ready, and Mrs. Delvile was prepared to depart. Cecilia approached to take leave of her, but Dr. Ly&s;ter following, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"No talking! no thanking! no compliments of any &s;ort! I &s;hall carry off my Patient without permit|ting one civil &s;peech, and for all the rude|ne&s;s I make her guilty of, I am willing to be re&s;pon&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia would then have retreated, but Mrs. Delvile, holding out both her hands, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"To every thing el&s;e, Dr. Ly&s;ter, I am content to &s;ubmit; but were I to die while uttering the words, I cannot leave this ine&s;timable creature without fir&s;t &s;aying how much I love her, how I honour, and how I thank her! without entreating her to be careful of her health, and conjur|ing
<PB N="299" REF="298">
her to compleat the greatne&s;s of her con|duct, by not &s;uffering her &s;pirits to &s;ink from the exertion of her virtue. And now my love, God ble&s;s you!"</Q></P>
<P>She then embraced her, and went on; Cecilia, at a motion of Dr. Ly&s;ter's, forbear|ing to follow her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And thus,"</Q> cried &s;he, when they were gone, <Q REND="inline">"thus ends all my connection with this family! which it &s;eems as if I was only to have known for the purpo&s;e of affording a new proof of the in&s;ufficiency of &s;ituation to con&s;titute happine&s;s. Who looks not upon mine as the perfection of human feli|city?&mdash;And &s;o, perhaps, it is, for it may be that Felicity and Humanity are never permitted to come nearer."</Q></P>
<P>And thus, in philo&s;ophic &s;adne&s;s, by rea&s;oning upon the univer&s;ality of mi&s;ery, &s;he re&s;trained, at lea&s;t, all violence of &s;or|row, though her &s;pirits were dejected, and her heart was heavy.</P>
<P>But the next day brought with it &s;ome comfort that a little lightened her &s;adne&s;s Mrs. Charlton, almo&s;t wholly recovered, was able to go down &s;tairs, and Cecilia had at lea&s;t the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing an happy conclu&s;ion to an illne&s;s of which, with the utmo&s;t concern and regret, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as the cau&s;e. She attended her with the mo&s;t unremitting a&s;&s;iduity, and being
<PB N="300" REF="299">
really very thankful, endeavoured to appear happy, and &s;lattered her&s;elf that, by con|tinual effort, the appearance in a &s;hort time would become reality.</P>
<P>Mrs. Charlton retired early, and Cecilia accompanied her up &s;tairs: and while &s;he was with her, was informed that Mr. Monckton was in the parlour.</P>
<P>The various, afflicting, and uncommon &s;cenes in which &s;he had been engaged &s;ince &s;he la&s;t &s;aw him, had almo&s;t wholly driven him from her remembrance, or when at any time he recurred to it, it was only to at|tribute the di&s;continuance of his vi&s;its to the offence &s;he had given hm, in refu&s;ing to follow his advice by relinqui&s;hing her Lon|don expedition.</P>
<P>Full, therefore, of the mortifying tran&s;|actions which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince their parting, and fearful of his enquiries into di&s;graces he had nearly foretold, &s;he heard him an|nounced with chagrin, and waited upon him in the mo&s;t painful confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Far different were the feelings of Mr. Monckton; he read in her countenance the dejection of di&s;appointment, which im|pre&s;&s;ed upon his heart the vivacity of hope: her evident &s;hame was to him &s;ecret tri|umph, her ill-concealed &s;orrow revived all his expectations.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tily began a conver&s;ation by men|tioning
<PB N="301" REF="300">
her debt to him, and apologi&s;ing for not paying it the moment &s;he was of age. He knew but too well how her time had been occupied, and a&s;&s;ured her the delay was wholly immaterial.</P>
<P>He then led to an enquiry into the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation of her affairs; but unable to endure a di&s;qui&s;ition, which could only be productive of cen&s;ure and mortifi|cation, &s;he ha&s;tily &s;topt it, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"A&s;k me not, I entreat you, Sir, any detail of what has pa&s;&s;ed,&mdash;the event has brought me &s;ufferings that may well make blame di&s;pen&s;ed with;&mdash;I acknowledge all your wi&s;dom, I am &s;en&s;ible of my own er|ror, but the affair is wholly dropt, and the unhappy connexion I was forming is broken off for-ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Little now was Mr. Monckton's effort in repre&s;&s;ing his further curio&s;ity, and he &s;tarted other &s;ubjects with readine&s;s, gaiety and ad|dre&s;s. He mentioned Mrs. Charlton, for whom he had not the &s;malle&s;t regard; he talked to her of Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e very exi&s;tence was indifferent to him; and he &s;poke of their common acquaintance in the country, for not one of whom he would have grieved, if a&s;&s;ured of meeting no more. His powers of conver&s;ation were enlivened by his hopes; and his exhilarated &s;pirits made all &s;ubjects &s;eem happy to him.
<PB N="302" REF="301">
A weight was removed from his mind which had nearly borne down even his remote&s;t hopes; the object of his eager pur&s;uit &s;eemed &s;till within his reach, and the rival into who&s;e power he had &s;o lately al|mo&s;t beheld her delivered, was totally re|nounced, and no longer to be dreaded. A revolution &s;uch as this, rai&s;ed expectations more &s;anguine than ever; and in quitting the hou&s;e, he exultingly con&s;idered him&s;elf relea&s;ed from every ob&s;tacle to his views&mdash;till, ju&s;t as he arrived home, he recollected his wife!.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>A Week pa&s;&s;ed, during which Cecilia, however &s;ad, &s;pent her time as u&s;ual with the family, denying to her&s;elf all vo|luntary indulgence of grief, and forbearing to &s;eek con&s;olation from &s;olitude, or relief from tears. She never named Delvile, &s;he begged Mrs. Charlton never to mention him; &s;he called to her aid the account &s;he had received from Dr. Ly&s;ter of his firm|ne&s;s, and endeavoured, by an emulous am|bition, to fortify her mind from the weak|ne&s;s of depre&s;&s;ion and regret.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bri&s;tol, <DATE>Oct. 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY &s;weet young friend will not, I hope, be &s;orry to hear of my &s;afe arrival at this place: to me every account of her health
<PB N="304" REF="303">
and welfare, will ever be the intelligence I &s;hall mo&s;t covet to receive. Yet I mean not to a&s;k for it in return; to chance I will tru&s;t for information, and I only write now to &s;ay I &s;hall write no more.</P>
<P>Too much for thanks is what I owe you, and what I think of you is beyond all power of expre&s;&s;ion. Do not, then, wi&s;h me ill, ill as I have &s;eemed to merit of you, for my own heart is almo&s;t broken by the ty|ranny I have been compelled to practice upon yours.</P>
<P>And now let me bid a long adieu to you, my admirable Cecilia; you &s;hall not be tormented with a u&s;ele&s;s corre&s;pondence, which can only awaken painful recollec|tions, or give ri&s;e to yet more painful new anxieties. Fervently will I pray for the re&s;toration of your happine&s;s, to which no|thing can &s;o greatly contribute as that wi&s;e, that uniform command, &s;o feminine, yet &s;o dignified, you maintain over your pa&s;&s;ions; which often I have admired, though never &s;o feelingly as at this con&s;cious moment! when my own health is the &s;acrifice of emo|tions mo&s;t fatally unre&s;trained.</P>
<P>Send to me no an&s;wer, even if you have the &s;weetne&s;s to wi&s;h it; every new proof of the genero&s;ity of your nature is to me but a new wound. Forget us, therefore, wholly,&mdash;alas! you have only known us

<CLOSER><SIGNED>AUGUSTA DELVILE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The attempted philo&s;ophy, and laboured re&s;ignation of Cecilia, this letter de&s;troy|ed: the &s;truggle was over, the apathy was at an end, and &s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears, which finding the vent they had long &s;ought, now flowed unchecked down her cheeks, &s;ad monitors of the weakne&s;s of rea&s;on oppo&s;ed to the angui&s;h of &s;orrow!</P>
<P>A letter at once &s;o care&s;&s;ing, yet &s;o ab|&s;olute, forced its way to her heart, in &s;pite of the fortitude &s;he had flattered her&s;elf was its guard. In giving up Delvile &s;he was &s;atisfied of the propriety of &s;eeing him no more, and convinced that even to talk of him would be folly and imprudence; but to be told that for the future they mu&s;t re|main &s;trangers to the exi&s;tence of each other&mdash;there &s;eemed in this a hard&s;hip, a rigour, that was in&s;upportable.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh what,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is human na|ture! in its be&s;t &s;tate how imperfect! that a woman &s;uch as this, &s;o noble in character, &s;o elevated in &s;entiment, with heroi&s;m to &s;acrifice to her &s;en&s;e of duty the happine&s;s
<PB N="306" REF="305">
of a &s;on, whom with joy &s;he would die to &s;erve, can her&s;elf be thus governed by pre|judice, thus en&s;laved, thus &s;ubdued by opi|nion!"</Q> Yet never, even when mi&s;erable, unju&s;t or irrational; her grief was unmixed with anger, and her tears &s;treamed not from re&s;entment, but affliction. The &s;itua|tion of Mrs. Delvile, however different, &s;he con&s;idered to be as wretched as her own. She read, therefore, with &s;adne&s;s, but not bitterne&s;s, her farewell, and received not with di&s;dain, but with gratitude, her &s;ym|pathy. Yet though her indignation was not irritated, her &s;ufferings were doubled, by a farewell &s;o kind, yet &s;o de&s;potic, a &s;ym|pathy &s;o affectionate, yet &s;o hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t indulgence of grief which &s;he had granted to her di&s;appointment, &s;he was &s;oon interrupted by a &s;ummons down &s;tairs to a gentleman.</P>
<P>Unfit and unwilling to be &s;een, &s;he begged that he might leave his name, and appoint a time for calling again.</P>
<P>Her maid brought for an&s;wer, that he believed his name was unknown to her, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her now, unle&s;s &s;he was employed in &s;ome matter of moment.</P>
<P>She then put up her letter, and went into the parlour; and there, to her infinite amazement, beheld Mr. Albany.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="306">
<Q REND="inline">"How little, Sir,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"did I expect this plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This plea&s;ure,</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"do you call it?&mdash;what &s;trange abu&s;e of words! what cau&s;ele&s;s trifling with hone&s;ty! is lan|guage of no purpo&s;e but to wound the ear with untruths? is the gift of &s;peech only granted us to pervert the u&s;e of under&s;tand|ing? I can give you no plea&s;ure, I have no power to give it any one; you can give none to me&mdash;the whole world could not inve&s;t you with the means!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who had little &s;pirit to defend her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"I will not vindicate the expre&s;&s;ion, but of this I will unfeignedly a&s;&s;ure you, I am at lea&s;t as glad to &s;ee you ju&s;t now, as I &s;hould be to &s;ee any body."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your eyes,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"are red, your voice is inarticulate;&mdash;young, rich, and attractive, the world at your feet; that world yet untried, and its fal&s;ehood un|known, how have you thus found means to anticipate mi&s;ery? which way have you uncovered the cauldron of human woes? Fatal and early anticipation! that cover once removed, can never be replaced; tho&s;e woes, tho&s;e boiling woes, will pour out upon you continually, and only when your heart cea&s;es to beat, will their ebullition cea&s;e to torture you!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="307">
<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;huddering, <Q REND="inline">"how cruel, yet how true!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why went you,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to the cauldron? it came not to you. Mi&s;ery &s;eeks not man, but man mi&s;ery. He walks out in the &s;un, but &s;tops not for a cloud; confident, he pur&s;ues his way, till the &s;torm which, gathering, he might have avoided, bur&s;ts over his devoted head. Scared and amazed, he repents his teme|rity; he calls, but it is then too late; he runs, but it is thunder which follows him! Such is the pre&s;umption of man, &s;uch at once is the arrogance and &s;hailowne&s;s of his nature! And thou, &s;imple and blind! ha&s;t thou, too, followed whither Fancy has led thee, unheeding that thy career was too vehement for tranquility, nor mi&s;&s;ing that lovely companion of youth's early inno|cence, till, adventurous and unthinking, thou ha&s;t lo&s;t her for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent weak &s;tate of Cecilia's &s;pirits, this attack was too much for her; and the tears &s;he had ju&s;t, and with diffi|culty re&s;trained, again forced their way down her cheeks, as &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"It is but too true,&mdash;I have lo&s;t her for ever!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor thing,"</Q> &s;aid he, while the rigour of his countenance was &s;oftened into the gentle&s;t commi&s;eration, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o young!&mdash;looking, too, &s;o innocent!&mdash;'tis hard!&mdash;
<PB N="309" REF="308">
And is nothing left thee? no &s;mall remain|ing hope, to cheat, humanely cheat thy yet not wholly extingui&s;hed credulity?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia wept without an&s;wering.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me not,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"wa&s;te my com|pa&s;&s;ion upon nothing; compa&s;&s;ion is with me no effu&s;ion of affectation; tell me, then, if thou de&s;erve&s;t it, or if thy misfortunes are imaginary, and thy grief is factitious?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Factitious,"</Q> repeated &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"Good heaven!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An&s;wer me, then, the&s;e que&s;tions, in which I &s;hall compri&s;e the only calamities for which &s;orrow has no controul, or none from human motives. Tell me, then, have you lo&s;t by death the friend of your bo&s;om?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is your fortune di&s;&s;ipated by extrava|gance, and your power of relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at an end?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; the power and the will are I hope equally undimini&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O then, unhappy girl! have you been guilty of &s;ome vice, and hangs remor&s;e thus heavy on your con&s;cience?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no; thank heaven, to that mi|&s;ery, at lea&s;t, I am a &s;tranger!"</Q></P>
<P>His countenance now again re&s;umed its &s;everity, and, in the &s;terne&s;t manner, <Q REND="inline">"Whence then,"</Q> he &s;aid," <Q REND="inline">the&s;e tears?
<PB N="310" REF="309">
and what is this caprice you dignify with the name of &s;orrow?&mdash;&s;trange wantonne&s;s of indolence and luxury! perver&s;e repin|ing of ungrateful plenitude!&mdash;oh had&s;t thou known what <HI>I</HI> have &s;uffered!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Could I le&s;&s;en what you have &s;uffered,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould &s;incerely rejoice; but heavy indeed mu&s;t be your affliction, if mine in its compari&s;on de&s;erves to be &s;tyled caprice!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Caprice!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"'tis joy! 'tis extacy compared with mine!&mdash;Thou ha&s;t not in licentiou&s;ne&s;s wa&s;ted thy inheritance! thou ha&s;t not by remor&s;e barred each ave|nue to enjoyment! nor yet has the cold grave &s;eized the beloved of thy &s;oul!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, are the evils you have your&s;elf &s;u&s;tained &s;o ir|remediable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, I have borne them all!&mdash;<HI>have</HI> borne? I bear them &s;till; I &s;hall bear them while I breathe! I may rue them, perhaps, yet longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;hrinking, <Q REND="inline">"what a world is this! how full of woe and wickedne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet thou, too, can&s;t complain,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"though happy in life's only ble&s;&s;ing, Innocence! thou, too, can&s;t murmur, tho' &s;tranger to death's only terror, Sin! Oh yet if thy &s;orrow is unpolluted with guilt,
<PB N="311" REF="310">
be regardle&s;s of all el&s;e, and rejoice in thy de&s;tiny!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But who,"</Q> cried &s;he, deeply &s;ighing, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall teach me &s;uch a le&s;&s;on of joy, when all within ri&s;es to oppo&s;e it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"will teach it thee, for I will tell thee my own &s;ad &s;tory. Then wilt thou find how much happier is thy lot, then wilt thou rai&s;e thy head in thankful triumph."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! triumph comes not &s;o lightly! yet if you will venture to tru&s;t me with &s;ome account of your&s;elf, I &s;hall be glad to hear it, and much obliged by the commu|nication."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"whatever I may &s;uffer: to awaken thee from this dream of fancied &s;orrow, I will open all my wounds, and thou &s;halt probe them with fre&s;h &s;hame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed,"</Q> cried Cecilia with quick|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I will not hear you, if the relation will be &s;o painful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon <HI>me</HI> this humanity is lo&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince puni&s;hment and penitence alone give me comfort. I will tell thee, there|fore, my crimes, that thou may&s;t know thy own felicity, le&s;t, ignorant it means nothing but innocence, thou &s;hould&s;t lo&s;e it, un|con&s;cious of its value.

the ba&s;is of la&s;ting unhappine&s;s;&mdash;Guilt is the ba&s;is of mine, and therefore I am a wretch for ever!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia would again have declined hear|ing him, but he refu&s;ed to be &s;pared: and as her curio&s;ity had long been excited to know &s;omething of his hi&s;tory, and the motives of his extraordinary conduct, &s;he was glad to have it &s;atisfied, and gave him the utmo&s;t attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not &s;peak to you of my family,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"hi&s;torical accuracy would little an&s;wer to either of us. I am a native of the We&s;t Indies, and I was early &s;ent hither to be educated. While I was yet at the Univer&s;ity, I &s;aw, I adored, and I pur&s;ued the faire&s;t flower that ever put forth its &s;weet buds, the &s;ofte&s;t heart that ever was broken by ill-u&s;age! She was poor and unprotected, the daughter of a villager; &s;he was untaught and unpretending, the child of &s;implicity! But fifteen &s;ummers had &s;he bloomed, and her heart was an ea&s;y con|que&s;t; yet, once made mine, it re&s;i&s;ted all allurement to infidelity. My fellow &s;tu|dents attacked her; &s;he was a&s;&s;aulted by all the arts of &s;eduction; flattery, bribery, &s;up|plication, all were employed, yet all failed; &s;he was wholly my own; and with &s;incerity &s;o attractive, I determined to marry her in defiance of all worldly objections.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="312">
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;udden death of my father called me ha&s;tily to Jamaica; I feared leaving this trea&s;ure unguarded, yet in decency could neither marry nor take her directly; I pledged my faith, therefore, to return to her, as &s;oon as I had &s;ettled my affairs, and I left to a bo&s;om friend the in&s;pection of her conduct in my ab&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To leave her was madne&s;s,&mdash;to tru&s;t in man was madne&s;s,&mdash;Oh ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ful race! how has the world been abhorrent to me &s;ince that time!

<P><Q REND="inline">"When I came to my fortune, intoxi|cated with &s;udden power, I forgot this fair blo&s;&s;om, I revelled in licentiou&s;ne&s;s and vice, and left it expo&s;ed and forlorn.

Then was &s;he revenged, for then fir&s;t remor&s;e was my portion: her image was brought back to my mind with frantic fondne&s;s, and bittere&s;t contrition.

At length, I thought I &s;aw her&mdash;in London, alone, and walking in the &s;treets at midnight,&mdash;I fearfully followed her,&mdash;and followed her into an hou&s;e of in|famy!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The wretches by whom &s;he was &s;ur|rounded were noi&s;y and drinking, they heeded me little,&mdash;but &s;he &s;aw and knew me at once! She did not &s;peak, nor did I,&mdash;but in two moments &s;he fainted and fell.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet did I not help her; the people took their own mea&s;ures to recover her, and when &s;he was again able to &s;tand, would have removed her to another apartment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I then went forward, and forcing them away from her with all the &s;trength of de&s;|peration, I turned to the unhappy &s;inner, who to chance only &s;eemed to leave what became of her, and cried, From this &s;cene
<PB N="316" REF="315">
of vice and horror let me yet re&s;cue you! you look &s;till unfit for &s;uch &s;ociety, tru&s;t your&s;elf, therefore, to me. I &s;eized her hand, I drew, I almo&s;t dragged her away. She trembled, &s;he could &s;carce totter, but neither con&s;ented nor refu&s;ed, neither &s;hed a tear, nor &s;poke a word, and her countenance pre&s;ented a picture of affright, amazement, and horror.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I took her to a hou&s;e in the country, each of us &s;ilent the whole way. I gave her an apartment and a female attendant, and ordered for her every convenience I could &s;ugge&s;t. I &s;tayed my&s;elf in the &s;ame hou&s;e, but di&s;tracted with remor&s;e for the guilt and ruin into which I had terrified her, I could not bear her &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In a few days her maid a&s;&s;ured me the the life &s;he led mu&s;t de&s;troy her; that &s;he would ta&s;te nothing but bread and water, never &s;poke, and never &s;lept.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alarmed by this account, I flew into her apartment; pride and re&s;entment gave way to pity and fondne&s;s, and I be&s;ought her to take comfort. I &s;poke, however, to a &s;tatue, &s;he replied not, nor &s;eemed to hear me. I then humbled my&s;elf to her as in the days of her innocence and fir&s;t power, &s;upplicating her notice, entreating even her commi&s;eration! all was to no purpo&s;e; &s;he neither received nor repul&s;ed me, and was
<PB N="317" REF="316">
alike inattentive to exhortation and to prayer.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whole hours did I &s;pend at her feet, vowing never to ari&s;e till &s;he &s;poke to me,&mdash;all, all, in vain! &s;he &s;eemed deaf, mute, in&s;en&s;ible; her face unmoved, a &s;ettled de&s;|pair fixed in her eyes,&mdash;tho&s;e eyes that had never looked at me but with dove-like &s;oft|ne&s;s and campliance!&mdash;She &s;at con&s;tantly in one chair, &s;he never changed her dre&s;s, no per&s;ua&s;ions could prevail with her to lie down, and at meals &s;he ju&s;t &s;wallowed &s;o much dry bread as might &s;ave her from dy|ing for want of food.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What was the di&s;traction of my &s;oul, to find her bent upon this cour&s;e to her la&s;t hour!&mdash;quick came that hour, but never will it be forgotten! rapidly it was gone, but eternally it will be remembered!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When &s;he felt her&s;elf expiring, &s;he ac|knowledged &s;he had made a vow, upon en|tering the hou&s;e, to live &s;peechle&s;s and mo|tionle&s;s, as a pennance for her offences!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I kept her loved corp&s;e till my own &s;en&s;es failed me,&mdash;it was then only torn from me,&mdash;and I have lo&s;t all recollection of three years of my exi&s;tence!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia &s;huddered at this hint, yet was not &s;urpri&s;ed by it; Mr. Go&s;port had ac|quainted her he had been formerly con|fined; and his flightine&s;s, wildne&s;s, florid
<PB N="318" REF="317">
language, and extraordinary way of life, had long led her to &s;u&s;pect his rea&s;on had been impaired.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;cene to which my memory fir&s;t leads me back,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"is vi&s;iting her grave; &s;olemnly upon it I returned her vow, though not by one of equal &s;everity. To her poor remains did I pledge my&s;elf, that the day &s;hould never pa&s;s in which I would receive nouri&s;hment, nor the night come in which I would take re&s;t, till I had done, or zealou&s;ly attempted to do, &s;ome &s;ervice to a fellow-creature.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For this purpo&s;e have I wandered from city to city, from the town to the country, and from the rich to the poor. I go into every hou&s;e where I can gain admittance, I admoni&s;h all who will hear me, I &s;hame even tho&s;e who will not. I &s;eek the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed where-ever they are hid, I follow the pro&s;perous to beg a mite to &s;erve them. I look for the Di&s;&s;ipated in public, where, amid&s;t their licentiou&s;ne&s;s, I check them; I pur&s;ue the Unhappy in private, where I coun&s;el and endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. My own power is &s;mall; my relations, during my &s;ufferings, limiting me to an annuity; but there is no one I &s;cruple to &s;olicit, and by zeal I &s;upply ability.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh life of hard&s;hip and pennance! la|borious, toil&s;ome, and re&s;tle&s;s! but I have
<PB N="319" REF="318">
merited no better, and I will not repine at it; I have vowed that I will endure it, and I will not be for&s;worn.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One indulgence alone from time to time I allow my&s;elf,&mdash;'tis Mu&s;ic! which has power to delight me even to rapture! it quiets all anxiety, it carries me out of my|&s;elf, I forget through it every calamity, even the bittere&s;t angui&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now then, that thou ha&s;t heard me, tell me, ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> cau&s;e of &s;orrow?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"this indeed is a Picture of Mi&s;ery to make <HI>my</HI> lot &s;eem all happine&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Art thou thus open to conviction?"</Q> cried he, mildly; <Q REND="inline">"and do&s;t thou not fly the voice of truth! for truth and reproof are one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I would rather &s;eek it; I feel my&s;elf wretched, however inadequate may be the cau&s;e; I wi&s;h to be more re&s;igned, and if you can in&s;truct me how, I &s;hall thankfully attend to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yet uncorrupted creature!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"with joy will I be thy monitor,&mdash;joy long unta&s;ted! Many have I wi&s;hed to &s;erve, all, hitherto, have rejected my of|fices; too hone&s;t to flatter them, they had not the fortitude to li&s;ten to me; too low to advance them, they had not the virtue to bear with me. You alone have I yet found
<PB N="320" REF="319">
pure enough not to fear in&s;pection, and good enough to wi&s;h to be better. Yet words alone will not content me; I mu&s;t al&s;o have deeds. Nor will your pur&s;e, how|ever readily opened, &s;uffice, you mu&s;t give to me al&s;o your time and your thoughts; for money &s;ent by others, to others only will afford relief; to lighten your own cares, you mu&s;t di&s;tribute it your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall find me,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"a do|cile pupil, and mo&s;t glad to be in&s;tructed how my exi&s;tence may be u&s;eful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Happy then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"was the hour that brought me to this county; yet not in &s;earch of you did I come, but of the mutable and ill-fated Belfield. Erring, yet ingenious young man! what a le&s;&s;on to the vanity of talents, to the gaiety, the brilli|ancy of wit, is the &s;ight of that green fallen plant! not &s;aple&s;s by age, nor withered by di&s;ea&s;e, but de&s;troyed by want of pruning, and bending, breaking by its own luxu|riance!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And where, Sir, is he now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Labouring wilfully in the field, with tho&s;e who labour compul&s;atorily; &s;uch are we all by nature, di&s;contented, perver&s;e, and changeable; though all have not cou|rage to appear &s;o, and few, like Belfield, are worth watching when they do. He told me he was happy; I knew it could not be:
<PB N="321" REF="320">
but his employment was innoffen&s;ive, and I left him without reproach. In this neigh|bourhood I heard of you, and found your name was coupled with prai&s;e. I came to &s;ee if you de&s;erved it; I have &s;een, and am &s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are not, then, very difficult, for I have yet done nothing. How are we to begin the&s;e operations you propo&s;e? You have awakened me by them to an expecta|tion of plea&s;ure, which nothing el&s;e, I be|lieve, could ju&s;t now have given me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We will work,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"together, till not a woe &s;hall remain upon your mind. The ble&s;&s;ings of the fatherle&s;s, the prayers of little children, &s;hall heal all your wounds with balm of &s;weete&s;t fragrance. When &s;ad, they &s;hall chear, when complaining, they &s;hall &s;oothe you. We will go to their roofle&s;s hou&s;es, and &s;ee them re|paired; we will exclude from their dwel|lings the inclemency of the weather; we will clothe them from cold, we will re&s;cue them from hunger. The cries of di&s;tre&s;s &s;hall be changed to notes of joy: your heart &s;hall be enraptured, mine, too, &s;hall revive&mdash;oh whither am I wandering? I am painting an Ely&s;ium! and while I idly &s;peak, &s;ome fainting object dies for want of &s;uccour! Farewell; I will fly to the a|bodes of wretchedne&s;s, and come to you to|morrow
<PB N="322" REF="321">
to render them the abodes of hap|pine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>He then went away.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular vi&s;it was for Cecilia mo&s;t fortunately timed: it almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed her out of her peculiar grief, by the view which it opened to her of general calamity; wild, flighty and imaginative as were his lan|guage and his coun&s;els, their morality was &s;triking, and their benevolence was affect|ing. Taught by him to compare her &s;tate with that of at lea&s;t half her &s;pecies, &s;he began more candidly to weigh what was left with what was withdrawn, and found the balance in her favour, The plan he had pre&s;ented to her of good works was con&s;onant to her character and inclinations; and the active charity in which he propo&s;ed to engage her, re-animated her fallen hopes, though to far different &s;ubjects from tho&s;e which had depre&s;&s;ed them. Any &s;cheme of worldly happine&s;s would have &s;ickened and di&s;gu&s;ted her; but her mind was ju&s;t in the &s;ituation to be impre&s;&s;ed with elevated piety, and to adopt any de|&s;ign in which virtue humoured melancholy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A SHOCK.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day in fanciful projects of bene&s;icence; &s;he de|termined to wander with her romantic new ally whither-&s;o-ever he would lead her, and to &s;pare neither fortune, time, nor trouble, in &s;eeking and relieving the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Not all her attempted philo&s;ophy had calmed her mind like this plan; in merely refu&s;ing indulgence to grief, &s;he had only locked it up in her heart, where eternally &s;truggling for vent, &s;he was almo&s;t overpowered by re&s;training it; but now her affliction had no longer her whole faculties to it&s;elf; the hope of doing good, the plea|&s;ure of ea&s;ing pain, the intention of devot|ing her time to the &s;ervice of the unhappy, once more delighted her imagination,&mdash;that &s;ource of promi&s;&s;ory enjoyment, which though often ob&s;tructed, is never, in youth, exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>She would not give Mrs. Charlton the unnece&s;&s;ary pain of hearing the letter with which &s;he had been &s;o much affected, but &s;he told her of the vi&s;it of Albany, and plea&s;ed her with the account of their &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="323">
At night, with le&s;s &s;adne&s;s than u&s;ual, &s;he retired to re&s;t. In her &s;leep &s;he be&s;towed riches, and poured plenty upon the land; &s;he humbled the oppre&s;&s;or, &s;he exalted the oppre&s;&s;ed; &s;laves were rai&s;ed to dignities, captives re&s;tored to liberty; beggars &s;aw &s;miling abundance, and wretchedne&s;s was bani&s;hed the world. From a cloud in which &s;he was &s;upported by angels, Cecilia beheld the&s;e wonders, and while enjoying the glorious illu&s;ion, &s;he was awakened by her maid, with news that Mrs. Charlton was dying!</P>
<P>She &s;tarted up, and, undre&s;&s;ed, was running to her apartment,&mdash;when the maid, calling to &s;top her, confe&s;&s;ed &s;he was already dead!</P>
<P>She had made her exit in the night, but the time was not exactly known; her own maid, who &s;lept in the room with her, go|ing early to her bed&s;ide to enquire how &s;he did, found her cold and motionle&s;s, and could only conclude that a paralytic &s;troke had taken her off.</P>
<P>Happily and in good time had Cecilia been &s;omewhat recruited by one night of refre&s;hing &s;lumbers and flattering dreams, for the &s;hock &s;he now received promi&s;ed her not &s;oon another.</P>
<P>She lo&s;t in Mrs. Charlton a friend, whom nearly from her infancy &s;he had con&s;idered
<PB N="325" REF="324">
as a mother, and by whom &s;he had been cheri&s;hed with tenderne&s;s almo&s;t unequalled. She was not a woman of bright parts, or much cultivation, but her heart was excel|lent, and her di&s;po&s;ition was amiable. Ce|cilia had known her longer than her me|mory could look back, though the earlie&s;t circum&s;tances &s;he could trace were kind|ne&s;&s;es received from her. Since &s;he had entered into life, and found the difficulty of the part &s;he had to act, to this worthy old lady alone had &s;he unbo&s;omed her &s;e|cret cares. Though little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her coun&s;el, &s;he was always certain of her &s;ym|pathy; and while her own &s;uperior judg|ment directed her conduct, &s;he had the re|lief of communicating her &s;chemes, and weighing her perplexities, with a friend to whom nothing that concerned her was in|different, and who&s;e greate&s;t wi&s;h and chief plea&s;ure was the enjoyment of her con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>If left to her&s;elf, in the pre&s;ent period of her life, Mrs. Charlton had certainly not been the friend of her choice. The delicacy of her mind, and the refinement of her ideas, had now rendered her &s;a&s;tidious, and &s;he would have looked out for elegancies and talents to which Mrs. Charlton had no preten&s;ions: but tho&s;e who live in the country have little power of &s;election; con|fined to a &s;mall circle, they mu&s;t be con|tent
<PB N="326" REF="325">
with what it offers; and however they may idolize extraordinary merit when they meet with it, they mu&s;t not regard it as e&s;|&s;ential to friend&s;hip, for in their circum|&s;cribed rotation, whatever may be their di&s;content, they can make but little change.</P>
<P>Such had been the &s;ituation to which Mrs. Charlton and Mrs. Harrel owed the friend&s;hip of Cecilia. Greatly their &s;upe|rior in under&s;tanding and intelligence, had the candidates for her favour been more numerous, the election had not fallen upon either of them. But &s;he became known to both before di&s;crimination made her diffi|cult, and when her enlightened mind di&s;cerned their deficiencies, they had already an intere&s;t in her affections, which made her &s;ee them with lenity: and though &s;ome|times, perhaps, con&s;cious &s;he &s;hould not have cho&s;en them from many, &s;he adhered to them with &s;incerity, and would have changed them for none.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, too weak for &s;i|milar &s;entiments, forgot her when out of &s;ight, and by the time they met again, was in&s;en&s;ible to every thing but &s;hew and di&s;|&s;ipation. Cecilia, &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed, fir&s;t grieved from di&s;appointed affection, and then lo&s;t that affection in angry con|tempt. But her fondne&s;s for Mrs. Charl|ton had never known abatement, as the kindne&s;s which had excited it had never
<PB N="327" REF="326">
known allay. She had loved her fir&s;t from childi&s;h gratitude; but that love, &s;trength|ened and confirmed by confidential inter|cour&s;e, was now as &s;incere and affectionate as if it had originated from &s;ympathetic ad|miration. Her lo&s;s, therefore, was felt with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, and neither &s;eeing nor knowing any means of replacing it, &s;he con&s;idered it as irreparable, and mourned it with bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t &s;urprize of this cruel &s;troke was &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, &s;he &s;ent an expre&s;s to Mr. Monckton with the news, and entreated to &s;ee him immediately. He came without delay, and &s;he begged his coun&s;el what &s;tep &s;he ought her&s;elf to take in con&s;equence of this event. Her own hou&s;e was &s;till unpre|pared for her; &s;he had of late neglected to ha&s;ten the workmen, and almo&s;t forgotten her intention of entering it. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to change her abode immedi|ately; &s;he was no longer in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Charlton, but of her grand-daughters and co-heire&s;&s;es, each of whom &s;he di&s;liked, and upon neither of whom &s;he had any claim.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton then, with the quickne&s;s of a man who utters a thought at the very moment of its projection, mentioned a &s;cheme upon which during his whole ride he had been ruminating; which was that &s;he would in&s;tantly remove to his hou&s;e,
<PB N="328" REF="327">
and remain there till &s;ettled to her &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>Cecilia objected her little right of &s;ur|pri&s;ing Lady Margaret; but, without wait|ing to di&s;cu&s;s it, le&s;t new objections &s;hould ari&s;e, he quitted her, to fetch him&s;elf from her lady&s;hip an invitation he meant to in&s;i&s;t upon her &s;ending.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though heartily di&s;liking this plan, knew not at pre&s;ent what better to adopt, and thought any thing preferable to to going again to Mrs. Harrel, &s;ince that only could be done by feeding the anxiety of Mr. Arnott.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton &s;oon returned with a me&s;&s;age of his own fabrication; for his lady, though obliged to receive whom he plea&s;ed, took care to guard inviolate the independence of &s;peech, &s;ullenly per&s;e|vering in refu&s;ing to &s;ay any thing, or per|ver&s;ely &s;aying only what he lea&s;t wi&s;hed to hear.</P>
<P>Cecilia then took a ha&s;ty leave of Mi&s;s Charltons, who, little affected by what they had lo&s;t, and eager to examine what they had gained, parted from her gladly, and, with a heavy heart and weeping eyes, borrowed for the la&s;t time the carriage of her late worthy old friend, and for-ever quitting her ho&s;pitable hou&s;e, &s;orrowfully &s;et out for the Grove.</P>
