<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following Poem was written &s;everal years ago, and aro&s;e from the recent publication of the Queen's original and mo&s;t intere&s;ing letters, which Sir John Dalrymple in&s;erted in the Appendix to his Memoirs of Great Britain. The number of the&s;e letters amounts to thirty-&s;even; they exhibit the character of this admirable woman in the mo&s;t affecting point of view, and fully ju&s;tify all the prai&s;e that has been given to the tenderne&s;s of her heart and the dignity of her mind. The Poem, which is but a kind of echo to her genuine &s;en|timents, had been thrown a&s;ide, with many other ver&s;es which the author has kept in privacy, from the fear of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing too frequently on the indulgence of the public; but he has been induced to print it with the preceding Stanzas, from the idea that it may find favour in the &s;ight of tho&s;e who love to dwell, at this particular &s;ea&s;on, on the great characters which it attempts to delineate.</P>
