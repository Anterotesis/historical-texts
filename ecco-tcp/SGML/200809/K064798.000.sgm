<HEAD>A LETTER TO Mr. DAVID HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING for a long time conceived the highe&s;t e&s;teem for the variety of your literary merit, a recommenda|tion from you was almo&s;t a &s;anction to pre-engage my implicit approba|tion. How high were my expectations rai&s;ed by your dedicatory commendation of <HI>the tragedy of Douglas</HI>; but, alas! how fallen, from &s;eeing its repre&s;entation: nor has a peru&s;al &s;ince won me over as an admirer of it.</P>
<P>Had the tragedy of <HI>Douglas</HI> been u&s;hered into the world as the promi&s;e of a dramatic genius, as &s;uch it ought to have been received with ap|plau&s;e; but its having been forced upon us au|thoritatively, in competition with all antiquity and the moderns, two obvious effects were pro|duced in the minds of men; to wit, curio&s;ity was excited in &s;ome, jealou&s;y provoked in others. I am &s;orry to inform you, Sir, that in con&s;e|quence, your <HI>national</HI> judgment has been great|ly
<PB N="4" REF="3">run upon here, and your critical &s;tocks re|duced almo&s;t to bankruptcy.</P>
<P>For my part, when I fir&s;t read your panegy|rical paragraph, I for &s;ome time he&s;itated as to the &s;incerity of it, and could not help reflect|ing on the pa&s;&s;age in <HI>The Art of Sinking in Poetry,</HI> written by your truly ingenious countryman Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot.</HI></P>
<Q>Take all the be&s;t qualities you can find in the mo&s;t celebrated heroes; if they will not be reduced to a con&s;i&s;tency, lay them <HI>all in a heap</HI> upon him. But be &s;ure they are qua|lities which your <HI>patron</HI> would be <HI>thought to have</HI>; and to prevent any mi&s;take which the world may be &s;ubject to, &s;elect from the al|phabet tho&s;e capital letters that compo&s;e his name, and &s;et them at the head of a dedica|tion.</Q>
<P>But, on a &s;econd reading of it, I changed opi|nion, and have moreover been a&s;&s;ured, that what is written you meant, to which, in amaze, I u&s;ed the famous reply of "<HI>E&s;t il po&s;&s;ible,</HI>" is it po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>The four great and revered names, <HI>Maffei, Voltaire, Olway, Shake&s;pear,</HI> which you have em|ployed as &s;upporters of <HI>Douglas,</HI> put me in mind of the &s;tatue of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in <HI>Paris,</HI> where the four nations, <HI>Germany, Spain, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Eng|land,</HI> are chained round him as vanqui&s;hed, and lavi&s;hly accompanied with all the tokens of &s;ub|jection. However this may plea&s;e the national vanity of the <HI>French,</HI> all foreigners with rea&s;on laugh at the folly of the de&s;ign, and unpardon|able foppery of the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">I re&s;pect you too much, Sir, to make any unmannered or indelicate application: &s;uch as "All fools admire, but men of &s;en&s;e approve;" and &s;hall impeach you by an evidence whom I dare &s;ay will not be objected to, your&s;elf&mdash;and from the &s;tandard of ta&s;te.</P>
<Q><P>Strong &s;en&s;e united to delicate &s;entiment, improved by practice, perfected by compari|&s;on, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of &s;uch, whenever they are to be found, is <HI>the true &s;tandard of ta&s;te and beauty.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion and nature are &s;ure, after a little time, to gain public vogue, which they maintain for ever.</P></Q>
<P>According to this ju&s;t and admirable doctrine, what is likely to be the fate of <HI>the tragedy of Dou|glas?</HI> Neglect and oblivion: however illumined for the pre&s;ent by the flambeau, you (forgive the expre&s;&s;ion,) too partially, or in the milde&s;t terms, too &s;anguinely, hold before it.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied to have preluded to the a&s;&s;ured triumph of this tragedy in your dedication, an un|provoked and congenial enforcer of the extrava|gance of its merit, has been artfully diffu&s;ed thro' the public under the title of <HI>The Tragedy of Dou|glas analy&s;ed,</HI> a &s;eeming attack, which the di&s;ap|pointed reader finds to be the &s;econd part of the &s;ame tune you had begun in your dedication, and which is there quoted, in order to be illu&s;|trated true in every article; therefore, to join i&s;&s;ue the &s;ooner, we &s;hall follow the method there|in ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">From page &s;eventh to twelfth is a tedious hi&s;|torical account of the fable, quite too long for the propo&s;ed limits of this letter, to be quoted, and therefore I refer to it.</P>
<P>The next heads proceeded to, are the charac|ters, manners, and diction. Having nothing to object again&s;t what the analy&s;er &s;ays relative to the two former, the following citations will &s;uf|ficiently &s;hew that our di&s;approbation ari&s;es not from caprice, but very ju&s;tifiable motives.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>For in your &s;hades I deem &s;ome &s;pirit dwells,</L>
<L>Who from the <HI>chiding</HI> &s;tream, or <HI>groaning</HI> oak,</L>
<L>Still <HI>hears,</HI> and <HI>an&s;wers</HI> to MATILDA's moan.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Wherefore <HI>chiding, groaning, hears, an&s;wers?</HI> This may be founded on &s;ome tradition, or po|pular error of <HI>Scotland</HI>; but to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under|&s;tandings, if not altogether non&s;en&s;ical, is at lea&s;t chimerical.</P>
<Q><L>Thou do'&s;t not think &s;o: <HI>woeful</HI> as I am.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Woeful indeed!</P>
<Q><L>But whether goe&s;t thou now?</L></Q>
<P>Is a que&s;tion in the low familiar.</P>
<P>The mi&s;placed and <HI>Hors d'Oeuvre</HI> compliment to the union&mdash;
<Q><L>A river here, there an ideal line, &amp;c.</L></Q>
is tedious and in&s;ipid; the line it clo&s;es with flat.</P>
<Q><L>The youthful warriour, is a <HI>clod</HI> of <HI>clay.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Clod</HI> and <HI>clay</HI> are not only mean words, but al|&s;o cacophonous to the ear.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="6">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>To dry</L>
<L>The&s;e piteous tears, I'd <HI>throw</HI> my life <HI>away.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>For but a confident, there is a quality-ea&s;e in this offer to oblige a friend. But &s;he &s;oon re|lap&s;es into a diction more appo&s;ite to her condi|tion;
<Q><L>I-will-&s;peak-&s;o-no-more,</L></Q>
and pre&s;ents us at the &s;ame time with a na&s;ty image.</P>
<Q><L>But &s;ilent mix</L>
<L>My tears with hers.</L></Q>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Can thy feeble pity</L>
<L><HI>Roll</HI> back the <HI>flood</HI> of never <HI>ebbing</HI> time?</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Is this &s;trictly correct, <HI>ebb</HI> and <HI>flood</HI> being op|po&s;ites? <HI>Roll</HI> is inadequate here.</P>
<Q><L>And with him,</L>
<L>In &s;pite of all my tears did MALCOLM go.</L></Q>
<P>That tears &s;hould have been &s;hed rather to detain her but three weeks married husband <HI>Douglas,</HI> than an un&s;ub&s;titutive brother, will be a&s;&s;ented to by all young married ladies who are &s;o unfa&s;hionable as to love their husbands.</P>
<Q><L>Fault'ring I took</L>
<L>An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would</L>
<L>Wed one of <HI>Douglas</HI>' name.</L></Q>
<P>This is a pretty je&s;uitical device, &s;he having been married to one already.</P>
<Q><PB N="8" REF="7">

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never did I hear</L>

<L>The good prie&s;t</L>

<L>With his lov'd <HI>Malcolm</HI> in the battle fell,</L>
<L>They <HI>two, alone,</HI> were privy to the marriage.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The poet is hard run here, in order to di&s;tre&s;s his <HI>heroine.</HI> Why kill the prie&s;t in battle? Per|haps this action happened in the days of the <HI>Church militant!</HI></P>
<Q><L>Acro&s;s the <HI>Carron</HI> lay</L>
<L>The <HI>de&s;tin'd</HI> road.</L></Q>
<P>This name of a river in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from its like|ne&s;s in &s;ound to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word <HI>carrion,</HI> is grating to the ears of a <HI>London</HI> audience. Why <HI>de&s;tin'd</HI> road?</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The hand that &s;pins th' uneven thread of life.</L>
<L>May &s;mooth the length that's yet to come of yours.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This may appear a pretty figure to tho&s;e ac|quainted with the art of &s;pinning, tho' it does not to me. The la&s;t line is mono&s;yllabically har&s;h, a fault our author is often guilty of.&mdash; To <HI>Anna</HI> replies

<L>Not in this world.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know in what other.</P>

<L>Never were vice and virtue pois'd &s;o ill</L>

<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Blu&s;h not, <HI>flower</HI> of <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI></L>

<L>I will be &s;worn thou wilt not.</L>

<L>Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes &s;hall &s;ee</L>
<L>The cho&s;en warriours of thy native land,</L>

<L>With brandi&s;h'd &s;words.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>I di&s;like this picture of <HI>Scotch</HI> warriours <HI>beat|ing the air</HI>; the renowned Don <HI>Quixote</HI> indeed encountered wind-mills.</P>

<P>The meaning of <HI>red</HI> here, and the <HI>angry &s;pirit of the water &s;hrieking,</HI> are unknown to us <HI>South Britons.</HI></P>
<Q><L>By the moon's light I &s;aw, whirl'd round and round,</L>
<L>A basket: &s;oon I drew it to the bank,</L>

<P>Quite the contrary, and all drenched in wa|ter, is mo&s;t likely, unle&s;s the basket had been purpo&s;ely caulked, from a fore-knowledge of the event.</P>
<Q><L>Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the <HI>flower.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Our author &s;eems fond of the word <HI>flower,</HI> to mark male eminence; wherefore, pur&s;uant to the bapti&s;mal vows you have made for him as his &s;pon&s;or, (not at all alluding to the &s;ong) let him be called the <HI>flower</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>'s tragic writers; for, on this &s;ide of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> nothing more will, or ought to be allowed him.</P>

<P>The &s;en&s;e of this line, not intelligible to us, alludes rather to the mu&s;ical alarms of <HI>Highlan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> bagpipes.</P>
<P>It would be too much to take in the whole <HI>prologue</HI> here; to read it is enough; where it emerges from confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity, it gently &s;ub&s;ides in kindred lines to this,
<Q><L>They knock'd alternate at each other's gate!</L></Q></P>
<P>It concludes with an humble petition in be|half of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>epilogue</HI> is a priggi&s;h affectation; and I hope will never be reli&s;hed by a genuine <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> audi|ence.
<PB N="16" REF="15">The far-fetched compari&s;on of the <HI>Nile</HI> is &s;tolen. I object to the epithet of <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> join|ed to <HI>melancholy</HI> in the la&s;t line.

<P>Why has the panegyri&s;t taken notice but of three performers, and natives of <HI>Ireland?</HI> &s;hame|ful partiality! This appears a flagrant combina|tion of the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> again&s;t the true &s;ons of old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> roa&s;t-beef, as if, for&s;ooth, the for|mer are only qualified to write tragedy, and the latter to perform. But, to thy teeth, partial Analy&s;t, I will do my country-folks the ju&s;tice they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>He who figured in the character of <HI>Glenalvon</HI> manife&s;ted a projectile &s;piritedne&s;s of per&s;on, and &s;trictly adherent to <HI>Horace</HI>'s rule, <HI>Semper &s;ibi con|&s;tans,</HI> without any variation throughout: now, this is what may be called, &s;upporting a charac|ter.</P>
<P>The actor of lord <HI>Randolph</HI> was &s;elf-collected, having the curb of his pa&s;&s;ions in hand. He ex|hibited a commanding calmne&s;s of deportment, and a level, &s;tomach-fetched, dignity of voice.</P>
<P>The liquid toned actre&s;s of <HI>Anna</HI> irradiated &s;orrow with her &s;miles; how &s;weetly did &s;he &s;peak?</P>

<P>The ground-work of the play is an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity, for either the lady <HI>Randolph</HI> mu&s;t have been very artful, who had a chopping boy 18 years before, to pa&s;s on her husband for a maid; or he, lord <HI>Randolph,</HI> mu&s;t have been very unac|quainted with the affairs of women. I fear the latter ca&s;e; and from ineffectual nights &s;prung the daily cau&s;e of her tears; and certainly a very material one. <HI>Penelope,</HI> it is true, mourned twenty years for <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>; but then &s;he did not admit an <HI>apathic</HI> lover to tantalize her in bed.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd, the jewels, and recognition of this doleful piece, are worn-out devices of the &s;tage, and expletive pegs of the human in|vention.</P>
<P>The protracted monotony of lady <HI>Randolph</HI>'s grief is irk&s;ome. One character often exhibit|ed in the &s;ame piece, mu&s;t be agitated by va|riety
<PB N="18" REF="17">of pa&s;&s;ions, otherwi&s;e we grow tired of the &s;amene&s;s.</P>
<P>After the di&s;covery of <HI>Douglas,</HI> he is not thrown into any intere&s;ting &s;ituation, nor is there any dramatic anxiety throughout, ari&s;ing from the intricacy of the plot; for from the beginning to the end, it is an uninterrupted downhill green|&s;word cour&s;e, entirely again&s;t the revolutionary &s;pirit of the &s;cenic laws, which perhaps, (nay by your mi&s;called di&s;&s;ertation, or rather di&s;&s;er+tatiuncle on tragedy, it appears) you are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> acquainted with.
