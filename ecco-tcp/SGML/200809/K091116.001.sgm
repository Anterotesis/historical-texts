<P>NOT being permitted to publi&s;h the means which enriched me with the ob&s;olete manu&s;cript from whence the following tale is extracted, its &s;implicity alone can authenticate it. &mdash;I make no apology for altering the language to that of the pre&s;ent age, &s;ince the author's would be frequently unintelligible. &mdash;A wonderful coinci|dence of events &s;tamps the narration at lea&s;t with probability, and the reign of Elizabeth was that of romance. If this Lady was not the child of fancy, her fate can hardly be paralleled; and the line of which &s;he came has been marked by an eminent hi&s;torian, as one di&s;tingui&s;hed alike by &s;plendor and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The characters interwoven in this &s;tory agree, in the outline, with hi&s;tory; and if love, or friend&s;hip, veil a fault, or irradiate a virtue, it is but rea&s;onable to allow of a weakne&s;s all feel in &s;ome particular in&s;tance. Hi&s;tory, like paint|ing, only perpetuates the &s;triking features of the mind; whereas the be&s;t and wor&s;t actions of princes often proceed from partialities and preju|dices, which live in their hearts, and are buried with them.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">The depredations of time have left chafms in the &s;tory, which &s;ometimes only heightens the pathetic. An inviolable re&s;pect for truth would not permit me to attempt connecting the&s;e, even where they appeared faulty.</P>
<P>To the hearts of both &s;exes nature has enriched with &s;en&s;ibility, and experience with refinement, this tale is humbly offered; in the per&s;ua&s;ion &s;uch will find it worthy their patronage.</P>

<HEAD>TO ADELAIDE MARIE DE MONTMORENCI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a long and painful journey through life, with a heart exhau&s;ted by afflictions, and eyes which can no longer &s;upply tears to lament them, I turn my every thought toward that grave on the verge of which I hover. Oh! why then, too generous friend, require me to live over my misfortunes? Such has been the peculiarity of my fate, that though tor|tured with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and the lo&s;s of
<PB N="2" REF="7">
every tye and hope that exalts or endears humanity, let but this feeble frame be co|vered with the du&s;t from which it &s;prung, and no trace of my ever having exi&s;ted would remain, except in the wounded con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who marked me out a &s;olitary victim to the crimes of my pro|genitors: For &s;urely I could never merit by my own the mi&s;ery of living as I have done&mdash;of dying as I mu&s;t do.</P>
<P>Alas! your partial affection demands a memorial which calls back to being all the &s;ad images buried in my bo&s;om, and opens anew every vein of my heart. Yet con&s;ummate mi&s;ery has a moral u&s;e, and if ever the&s;e &s;heets reach the publick, let the repiner at little evils learn to be ju&s;ter to his God and him&s;elf, by unavoidable com|pari&s;on. But am I not a&s;&s;uming an in&s;o|lent con&s;equence in thus admoni&s;hing? Alas, it is the dear-bought privilege of the unfortunate to be tedious!</P>
<P>My life commenced with an incident &s;o extraordinary as the following facts alone could incline any one to credit. As &s;oon as capable of reflection, I found my&s;elf
<PB N="3" REF="8">
and a &s;i&s;ter of my own age, in an apart|ment with a lady, and a maid older than her&s;elf. &mdash;Every day furni&s;hed us with whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or improvement, &s;upplied as it &s;eemed by &s;ome invi&s;ible hand; for I rarely mi&s;&s;ed either of the few who commonly &s;urround|ed me. This Rece&s;s could not be called a cave, becau&s;e it was compo&s;ed of vari|ous rooms; and the &s;tones were obviou&s;ly united by labor; yet every room was di&s;|tinct, and divided from the re&s;t by a vaulted pa&s;&s;age with many &s;tairs, while our light proceeded from &s;mall ca&s;ements of painted gla&s;s, &s;o infinitely above our reach that we could never &s;eek a world be|yond; and &s;o dim, that the beams of the &s;un were almo&s;t a new object to us when we quitted this retirement. The&s;e re|marks occurred as our minds unfolded; for at fir&s;t we were content, through habit and ignorance, nor once be&s;towed a thought on &s;urrounding objects. The lady I have mentioned called us her chil|dren, and care&s;&s;ed us both with parental fondne&s;s. &mdash;Ble&s;t with every gentle charm,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
it is not wonderful &s;he fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of tho&s;e who had no one el&s;e to idolize. Every morning we met in a larger room than the re&s;t, where a very venerable man performed ma&s;s, and con|cluded with a di&s;cour&s;e calculated to en|dear retirement. From him we learnt there was a terrible large place called the world, where a few haughty individuals commanded mi&s;erable millions, whom a few artful ones made &s;o; that Providence had graciou&s;ly re&s;cued us from both, nor could we ever be &s;ufficiently grateful. Young hearts teem with unformed ideas, and are but too &s;u&s;ceptible of elevated and enthu&s;ia&s;tic impre&s;&s;ions. Time gave this man in&s;en&s;ibly an influence over us, as a &s;uperior being, to which his appear|ance greatly contributed. Imagine a tall and robu&s;t figure habited in black, and marked by a commanding au&s;terity of manners. &mdash;His features bore the traces of many &s;orrows, and a kind of early old age, which intere&s;ted every ob&s;erver. The fire and nobility of his eye, the graceful|ne&s;s
<PB N="5" REF="10">
of his decay, and the heart-affecting &s;olemnity of his voice,
<Q><L>While on his reverend temples grew</L>
<L>The blo&s;&s;oms of the grave,</L></Q>
gave an authority almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible to Fa|ther Anthony, as we called him from hearing our mamma, to whom we under|&s;tood he was brother. He u&s;ually partook our dinner, and from that time 'till the next morning vani&s;hed, for we knew not how or where he went. The interval we pa&s;&s;ed in little u&s;eful works, or in conver|&s;ation with our mamma, who&s;e only em|ployment was that of forming our minds, for the world we were taught to dread. &mdash; <HI>She</HI> was our world, and all the tender af|fections, of which I have &s;ince proved my heart &s;o full, centered in her, and my &s;i&s;|ter. Time and &s;orrow had given a wan delicacy to features exqui&s;itely regular, while the &s;oft &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on united every common idea of beauty and elegance to a feminine helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, which is, when unaffected, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of all charms. Her temper was equal, and her under&s;tanding enriched by a mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="6" REF="11">
knowledge, to which &s;he was every day adding by perpetual &s;tudy. Inclined &s;trongly by nature to &s;erious reflection, and all her favorite employments, I u&s;ed to pa&s;s tho&s;e hours at her &s;ide Ellinor de|voted to her play-things, or to Alice, who&s;e memory was overcharged with tho&s;e marvellous tales children always delight in. As our ideas every day expanded, we thought more and more concerning our origin, and our impri&s;onment. We knew Father Anthony con&s;tantly di&s;appeared, but how or where was a &s;ecret beyond our comprehen&s;ion; for in all our re&s;earches we never found a door except tho&s;e com|mon to the family, and which &s;hut us from the world. Ellinor, who&s;e lively imagi|nation readily imbibed the romantic and extravagant, conjectured we were in the power of &s;ome giant; nay, &s;uch was her di&s;gu&s;t to Father Anthony, that &s;he &s;ome|times apprehended he was a magician, and would one day or other devour us. I had a very different idea; and fancied our retreat a hallowed circle to &s;eclude us from the wicked, while Father Anthony
<PB N="7" REF="12">
was our guardian genius. Frequently we by agreement interrogated Alice, who though fond to the common degree of an old nur&s;e of both, but more e&s;pecially Ellen, re&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e little arts nature her|&s;elf in&s;pires. Our mamma we now and then ventured to &s;ound, but her gravity always di&s;concerted us, and we retreated from a vain attempt.</P>
<P>She once ab&s;ented her&s;elf fourteen days, and left us to our own conjectures, in a &s;pot truly chearle&s;s. Part of the time we &s;pent in &s;earching once more for a door, and the re&s;t in childi&s;h lamentations for her lo&s;s; which Alice &s;till a&s;&s;ured us would be but a temporary one. Inflexible in the di&s;charge of her duty, &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in locking our apartment every day after dinner, at which time all who had occa|&s;ion, doubtle&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed in and out of the Rece&s;s.</P>
<P>Being deprived of my cu&s;tomary re|&s;ource, books, to amu&s;e a part of our melancholy lei&s;ure, we mutually agreed to invent tales from the many whole-length pictures, which ornamented the be&s;t room,
<PB N="8" REF="13">
and to take them as they came alternately. Ellinor readily invented a ludicrous &s;tory upon the portrait of an old man, which made us both laugh heartily. I turned my eyes to con&s;ider what I &s;hould &s;ay a|bout the next; they re&s;ted on the figure of a man of noble mien, his dre&s;s I then knew no name for, but have &s;ince found to be armour; a page held his helmet, and his hair, of a pale brown, fell over his &s;houlders. He was &s;urrounded with many emblems of martial merit, and his eyes, which &s;eemed bent on me, were full of a tender &s;weetne&s;s. A &s;entiment of veneration, mingled with a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;oftne&s;s, pierced my &s;oul at once; my tongue faltered with a namele&s;s idea, and I re&s;ted my head again&s;t the &s;houlder of my &s;i&s;ter. That dear girl turned to me with quickne&s;s, and the beam of her eye was like that of the picture. I &s;urveyed her over and over, and found in every feature the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;emblance; when &s;he frowned, &s;he had all his dignity; when &s;he &s;miled, all his &s;weetne&s;s. An awe, I could not conquer, made me un|able
<PB N="9" REF="14">
to form any tale on that &s;ubject, and I directed my attention toward the next. It repre&s;ented a lady in the flower of youth, dre&s;t in mourning, and &s;eeming in every feature to be marked by &s;orrow; a black veil half &s;haded a coronet &s;he wept over. If the la&s;t picture awakened vene|ration, this &s;eemed to call forth a thou|&s;and melting &s;en&s;ations; the tears ru&s;hed involuntarily into our eyes, and, cla&s;p|ing, we wept upon the bo&s;oms of each other. "Ah! who can the&s;e be? cried we both together. Why do our hearts thus throb before inanimate canvas? &s;urely every thing we behold is but part of one great my&s;tery; when, will the day come, de&s;tined to clear it up?" We walked arm in arm round, and moralized on every portrait, but none intere&s;ted us like the&s;e; we were never weary of &s;ur|veying or talking about them; a young heart is frequently engro&s;&s;ed by a favorite idea, amid all the glare of the great world; nor is it then wonderful ours were thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when entombed alive in &s;uch a narrow boundary. I knew not why,
<PB N="10" REF="15">
but we lived in the pre&s;ence of the&s;e pic|tures as if they under&s;tood us, and blu&s;hed when we were guilty of the &s;lighte&s;t folly.</P>
<P>The moment our mamma returned, we flew into her arms, and interrupted her tender care&s;&s;es with importunate enquiries concerning the&s;e favorite pictures. She regarded us with a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;her eyes filled with tears, and &s;he bade us leave her to recover her&s;elf alone. Shortly after &s;he &s;ummoned Alice, and held with her a conver&s;ation which re&s;tored her tranquil|lity; but &s;he carefully avoided our enqui|ries, endeavouring to diver&s;ify our hours by mu&s;ic, drawing, poetry, geography, and every ornamental branch of educa|tion. Whenever we verged toward an hint about the retreat&mdash;"wait, my dear girls, &s;he would &s;ay, the appointed hour&mdash;alas, one may follow it, when you will wi&s;h your&s;elves &s;till uninformed." &mdash;Im|pre&s;&s;ed with an undefinable melancholy, our years pa&s;&s;ed on 'till womanhood ap|proached.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">Pardon me if I linger over the&s;e &s;cenes; I have but few &s;uch to relate, and they are all of my life upon which my heart dares to pau&s;e. How are we born to in|vent our own mi&s;eries! We &s;tart forward from the goal of youth, fearle&s;s and im|patient, nor know the heights and depths through which we mu&s;t labor; oppre&s;&s;ed in turn by every element, and often over whelmed with that mo&s;t in &s;upportable of all burthens, our own di&s;&s;atisfied &s;ouls. How have I wept the moment I quitted the Rece&s;s&mdash;a moment I then lived but in hope of! To be always erring, is the weakne&s;s of humanity, and to be always repent|ing, its puni&s;hment.&mdash;Alas! could we learn wi&s;dom without experience, man|kind would perhaps be too happy.</P>
<P>Father Anthony in time ingratiated him|&s;elf with us, by his continual remon&s;tran|ces again&s;t our being &s;hut up in a place which bounded our ideas &s;o much that he de&s;paired of making us comprehend half of what he taught us. We &s;econded his advice with endle&s;s entreaties. Our mamma, who was per&s;ua&s;ion it&s;elf in her
<PB N="12" REF="17">
own per&s;on, was not proof again&s;t it in that of another. "Alas, my children, would &s;he often &s;ay, by what fatality do you &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire to leave a home you will hereafter remember with a plea&s;ure full of regret? In vain you would return to it&mdash;you will lo&s;e a ta&s;te for the tranquil enjoyments this &s;olitude offers, without perhaps finding any to &s;upply them. Yet far be the &s;elfi&s;h weakne&s;s from my heart of puni&s;hing you, even for your welfare. You &s;hall <HI>&s;ee</HI> this ad|mired world. May it ever plea&s;e you as it will at fir&s;t &s;ight!"</P>
<P>We embraced her with youthful tran&s;|port, and then each other&mdash;"We &s;hall go at la&s;t, exclaimed both together, we &s;hall &s;ee many more like our&s;elves!"</P>
<P>"What &s;ay you, children? cried &s;he; ah! you will &s;ee few indeed like your|&s;elves."</P>
<P>The next day was appointed for our enfranchi&s;ement. We packed and unpacked our little luggage fifty times over for mere employment 'till the appointed hour came; when we were &s;ummoned to the
<PB N="13" REF="18">
chamber of our only friend, who was walking about apparently agitated with a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>"Are you grieved, mamma, cried I, that we are going to be happy?"</P>
<P>"Ah, no Matilda! I am grieved, be|cau&s;e I think you are ju&s;t cea&s;ing to be &s;o. In this peaceful &s;olitude I could &s;upply to you every lo&s;t relation&mdash;the adopted chil|dren of my heart, I &s;tood between you and a fate at once di&s;tingui&s;hed, ob&s;cure, and affecting.&mdash;Alas, why do you wre&s;t your|&s;elves and your &s;ecret from me? Why do you oblige me to tell you, you mu&s;t never more call me any thing but Mrs. Marlow?"</P>
<P>"Never more call you mamma! &s;ighed I, incoherently, who then are our pa|rents?"</P>
<P>"You have no father, he who gave you a being &s;leeps in the bo&s;om of God."</P>
<P>"Our mother&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Lives&mdash;but not for you&mdash;enquire no farther; let this &s;pecimen of knowledge teach you to fear it.&mdash;When the time re|quires it, I &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e your whole &s;tory;
<PB N="14" REF="19">
&mdash;weep no more, my lovely, my affect|ing girls; I have lo&s;t but a name; for my nature is unalterable. All who will &s;ee us know I never was married, which ab&s;o|lutely compelled me to this di&s;covery. But I dare believe they will rely on my rectitude, and welcome you by whatever name I &s;hall give you. Rea&s;ons you will hereafter know, induce me always to con|ceal a retreat, where alone I could have hid you, and both mu&s;t, ere we leave it, &s;olemnly promi&s;e never to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;e|cret."</P>
<P>Chilled with this &s;olemn preparation, our de&s;ire of liberty vani&s;hed; we felt like links &s;truck from the chain of crea|tion; and &s;till with re&s;tle&s;s imaginations explored the remainder of a my&s;tery which we wept by anticipation. "She lives, but not for you!" were words who&s;e &s;ound vibrated to my heart, while plea&s;ure danced around me, and the doubt attend|ing the future, often robbed the pre&s;ent of enjoyment.</P>
<P>After we had made at her knees the &s;trict promi&s;e required, &s;he muffled our
<PB N="15" REF="20">
faces, and taking my hand, as Alice did my &s;i&s;ter's, led us through many cold pa&s;|&s;ages for &s;ome minutes; when unbinding our eyes, we found our&s;elves in a noble cloi&s;ter. We flew into the garden it bor|dered, and how &s;trong was the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;cene before us! from the man&s;ion, which &s;tood on a hill, &s;pread a rich and fertile valley, mingled with thickets, half &s;een or clu&s;tered hamlets, while through the living land&s;cape flowed a clear river,
<Q><L>&mdash;and to the main</L>
<L>The liquid &s;erpent drew his &s;ilver train.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;un was &s;inking, involved in &s;well|ing waves of gold and purple, upon whom we almo&s;t gazed our&s;elves blind: for though we had often read and heard of his effulgence, the author of univer&s;al being can alone di&s;play it. Imagination, Madam, may &s;ometimes &s;urpa&s;s the won|ders of art, but tho&s;e of nature leave all imagination far behind.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow led us through the Abbey, which might rather be called a palace: it
<PB N="16" REF="21">
was erected upon the ruins of a Mona&s;tery de&s;troyed at the Reformation, and &s;till was called by the name of St. Vincent. It had all the Gothic magnificence and elegance, and we learnt with plea&s;ure that Mrs. Marlow, the &s;i&s;ter of its owner, Lord Scroope, was con&s;idered by every &s;ervant as its mi&s;tre&s;s. A noble apartment within hers was allotted for us, and the charms of the new world mingled with our melancholy reveries, alike de&s;troy|ing our re&s;t. The ri&s;ing of the &s;un, who&s;e fir&s;t beams gilt our windows, rouzed us entirely. Methinks, while I expatiate on the&s;e trifles, time &s;eems &s;u&s;|pended, and the &s;cene &s;till exi&s;ting before me. The rich dew-drops, tho&s;e jewels with which nature decks her bo&s;om, glit|tering to the rays that wandered over the gra&s;s: the various animals that &s;eemed to derive a daily exi&s;tence from the return of that glorious orb: the morning hymn of the winged creation, all united to awaken our gratitude, and humble us be|fore the author of our being. "Accept, oh God, would we cry &s;pontaneou&s;ly, the
<PB N="17" REF="22">
adoration of two hearts, who know no claim in this mighty univer&s;e but thee! oh deign to ble&s;s the de&s;ire of doing right with the power! and if only &s;orrow touch our hearts, &s;anctify it with re&s;ignation: &s;o when time delivers us up to eternity, hope may be our conductor!"</P>
<P>We were delighted with a playful group of fawns and deer, with whom we longed to frolic, and &s;tole through Mrs. Marlow's chamber into the park, by a pa&s;&s;age &s;he had pointed out to us the day before. What was our &s;urprize when we &s;aw tho&s;e with whom we had in idea mingled, were large fierce creatures, and that had they not run from us, we mu&s;t from them; that every bird feared its natural pro|tector, and that man lived in continual warfare with every things in creation, even to his own &s;pecies!</P>
<P>I am tedious, and mu&s;t have done with the&s;e puerilities, which yet on reflection yield the pure&s;t plea&s;ures of our lives. Mrs. Marlow procured for us the be&s;t in|&s;tructors in every art and &s;cience that re|mote re&s;idence afforded, and, by her own
<PB N="18" REF="23">
example, gave that elegant fini&s;h to our manners, precept never can. Extremely detached, by our &s;ituation, from &s;ociety, we ea&s;ily di&s;cerned Mrs. Marlow was willing we &s;hould be &s;o, for &s;he frequently expre&s;&s;ed anxiety at the thoughts of Lord Scroope's return; who, I under&s;tood, was &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;ador to the Hague from Queen Eli|zabeth, Our ma&s;ters, our &s;ervants, and the various ru&s;tics who tenanted the e&s;tate, met in the chapel of St. Vincent's Abbey once a week, and tho&s;e were all our intercour&s;e with &s;ociety. On the evening of every Sunday we regularly went to the cell of Father Anthony, which was a cot rai&s;ed by Lord Scroope (to whom he &s;tood in the &s;ame relation as Mrs Mar|low) on the verge of a large wood which &s;heltered the man&s;ion behind. Here, while we were indulged with all tho&s;e &s;imple repa&s;ts novelty gives charms to, our minds were enlarged by conver&s;ations on every thing &s;ublime or in&s;tructive. If benevo|lence drew Mrs. Marlow abroad, &s;he made us always her companions, and gave her alms but through our hands; ordering
<PB N="19" REF="24">
us ever to add &s;ome mite of our own, in proportion to our means. Avarice is rarely the vice of youth; at lea&s;t, if I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udge by my own heart; for the chief joy of receiving, to me, was that of giving. Nor could Charity have de&s;cended to earth in a more lovely form, than that of Mrs. Marlow. At a tale of di&s;tre&s;s her eye a&s;&s;umed a melting benignity rarely &s;een, and never de&s;cribed; while her approach gave that plea&s;ure to every &s;ufferer, one &s;hould feel at the vi&s;ible pre&s;ence of a guardian angel.</P>
<P>Three years elap&s;ed in this manner, ere Lord Scroope returned; and when he did, he was &s;o deeply engaged in politics, that the various pre&s;ents he continually &s;ent from London, was to us the only differ|ence.</P>
<P>Still the &s;ad found,&mdash;"your mother lives&mdash;but not for you!" rung through our hearts occa&s;ionally; &s;till we equally de|&s;ired to di&s;cover the Rece&s;s; and wan|dered through St. Vincent's Abbey with the &s;ame curio&s;ity we once before did through that. The more we reflected, the
<PB N="20" REF="25">
more we were convinced it mu&s;t be near us; but the re&s;pect we had for Mrs. Mar|low's &s;olemn injunctions, &s;ealed our lips to every &s;ervant, and we never were allowed to ramble unattended.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow, endued with the pure&s;t principles, ju&s;tly conceived happine&s;s the noble&s;t u&s;e of under&s;tanding; and bent her whole attention towards convincing us, the fate appointed us was the mo&s;t de&s;irable in the world. "Here, would &s;he &s;ay, in a happy retirement, free alike from the drudgeries of high or low life, peace and innocence becalms your hearts, and blooms on your cheeks. Unenvying and unenvied as now, may that moment find you none can avoid! Ah, how un|like the vices and mi&s;eries of a court! There you can have no vice &s;o injurious to your&s;elves as &s;incerity; no merit, like hypocri&s;y. Love and friend&s;hip are un|known, and their names made u&s;e of but to entrap the unwary. Women that have beauty are de&s;troyed by it, and all who have not, are neglected. The gifts of man take place of the gifts of God, and money
<PB N="21" REF="26">
alone con&s;titutes merit.&mdash;Ah, never! ne|ver! my dear girls, can you enough ble&s;s that indulgent Providence, which with|draws you from it!"</P>
<P>Shall I confe&s;s my vanity? When I looked in the gla&s;s, I did not think I &s;hould be neglected, even at court. I had no opportunity for forming any ju&s;t com|pari&s;on indeed; for the ru&s;tics around us, &s;corched with toil, had only charms enough left to &s;hew what they might have been with care. The clearne&s;s of my complexion, and the delicacy of my fea|tures, left me no equal, but my &s;i&s;ter: Nay, even our habits, though often only of a finer camblet than theirs, were made in &s;o different a manner, that they did not appear to be compo&s;ed of the &s;ame mate|rials.</P>
<P>However di&s;po&s;ed to profit by the ad|vice of our more than parent, Heaven did not permit us to be happy. The clouds broke at once over our heads; Mrs. Marlow, our only tye on earth, and therefore doubly prized, was &s;eized with a fever; the more dangerous, becau&s;e it
<PB N="22" REF="27">
was not violent enough at fir&s;t to &s;hew it&s;elf. To paint our di&s;traction would be a vain attempt, Kneeling on each &s;ide her bed, for fourteen days and nights, we by tears and inward &s;upplications per&s;e|cuted the Almighty. Affectionately at|tached to us, &s;he &s;truggled for our &s;akes with the di&s;order, 'till having worn her down to a &s;keleton, it began at la&s;t to abate; but notwith&s;tanding every effort of art, could never be eradicated. Scarce had we breathed after this di&s;tre&s;s, when an ex|pre&s;s from London delivered a pacquet to Mrs. Marlow, which occa&s;ioned her in|&s;tantly to &s;ummon Father Anthony; they remained in con&s;ultation for &s;ome time, when they bade Alice order us in&s;tantly to join them.</P>
<P>"My children, &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, faintly, an unfore&s;een event obliges us once more to retire to the Rece&s;s. Every thing is at this moment preparing for our reception. You are now at years to judge of the im|portance of its concealment, nor will I longer make it a my&s;tery.&mdash;But why thus afflict your&s;elves for a temporary re|&s;traint?
<PB N="23" REF="28">
If I am willing, for your &s;akes, to be carried thither, like a corp&s;e into a tomb, &s;urely you will not be &s;o un|generous as to vent one &s;elfi&s;h lamen|tation?"</P>
<P>Effectually &s;ilenced by this noble re|proof, we collected, in confu&s;ion and grief, our clothes and ornaments; when, returning to her room, we found there Father Anthony, an old dome&s;tick called James, Alice, and the Hou&s;ekeeper; who, having di&s;per&s;ed the other &s;ervants; pre|ceded us to a &s;tore-room on the ground floor, and opening a pre&s;s, unfa&s;tened a fal&s;e back, which conducted us into a clo|&s;et, dark, but for our torches. She then lifted a part of the floor, fitted very neatly, and di&s;covered a narrow pair of &s;tairs, down which we went, leaving her behind, and effectually &s;ecured our&s;elves, by bolt|ing it firmly on the in&s;ide. We pa&s;t through &s;everal &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages built on arches, and pre&s;erved from damps by cavities which pa&s;&s;ed through every &s;tatue that ornamented the garden, 'till at la&s;t we reached our pri&s;on. But judge of

my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I found the &s;o of|ten-&s;ought entrance was a door of the &s;ize of that portrait which fir&s;t gave me &s;uch &s;ingular &s;en&s;ations, and which I perceived was made to fall together, with a &s;pring al|mo&s;t imperceptible.</P>
<P>Father Anthony &s;ilenced the exclama|tions I would have made, and drew me at once to Mrs. Marlow; who, pale and lifele&s;s with the fatigue of this removal, gave additional terrors to the moment. Whether the agitation of her mind in|crea&s;ed her malady, or it was originally beyond cure, I know not; but &s;aw, with &s;pechle&s;s affliction, from the moment of our return to the Rece&s;s, &s;he would ne|ver leave it alive. Enclo&s;ed in a &s;pot with|out &s;ufficient air, attendance, or advice, we &s;aw her fini&s;h her generous attachment to us, by re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ting our intrea|ties.</P>
<P>"Let us quit this dreary place, I would &s;ay, if but for a cottage. Let us not, in lo&s;ing you, have the cruel aggravation of contributing to &s;o great a misfortune.&mdash;Oh!
<PB N="25" REF="30">
what more can we have to fear, than the lo&s;s of all we love?"</P>
<P>"Why, why, my children, returned &s;he, thus embitter a common fate? Can I, who have voluntarily pa&s;&s;ed my youth in a tomb, dread to bury my du&s;t in it? You know my opinion is &s;ingular, nor do I think man could avert the &s;troke when God recalls us, however wi&s;e or willing. If I had been taken earlier from you, indeed, heavy to all mu&s;t have been the calamity; but after hav|ing taught you to live, there remains this only le&s;&s;on, and my duty is complete; you now are enabled to judge for your|&s;elves, confide in God, and he will not de&s;ert you."</P>
<P>"Alas! would I cry, drowned in tears, from your eye alone have we learnt when we did any thing aright; we &s;hall no lon|ger know good from evil when that dear eye is clo&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Matilda, replied &s;he with a &s;olemn air, remember only when you are called to any important action, to con&s;ult your heart in &s;olitude; God has placed in that

heart an unerring monitor, and if we hear not the &s;mall &s;till voice, it is becau&s;e we drown it in the noi&s;e of the world; then &s;hall we meet again to part no more; then at the tribunal of the Mo&s;t High, I &s;hall gladly &s;ay, "the&s;e trea|&s;ures, O Lord, did&s;t thou entru&s;t to my hand unfullied, behold even &s;o I re&s;tore them."</P>
<P>Ri&s;ing up as &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, &s;he held a hand of each of us to her heart, while her eyes &s;treamed with a kind of glory when lifted toward her Creator. Never did I &s;ee &s;uch an animated figure; her &s;oul &s;eemed that moment bur&s;ting from its beauteous man&s;ion to join its &s;i&s;ter angels.</P>

In this little hi&s;tory you will find the full motive of my retreat, and the means by which it was effected."</P>
<P>"You already know I am &s;i&s;ter to the pre&s;ent Lord Scroope, but you know not that I derived my birth from the ill-judged zeal of my mother. Bred up a Papi&s;t, &s;he no &s;ooner entertained a pa&s;&s;ion for Lord Scroope, than &s;he formed a de&s;ign to convert him to the Catholick religion. She was hand&s;ome, as I have always heard, and he was young; he affected to be &s;en|&s;ible of her efforts, which redoubled her zeal. She thought the love of Heaven alone actuated her heart, but he took ad|vantage of tho&s;e moments, and &s;he found too late &s;he had &s;acrificed her own &s;oul's welfare to his indulgence: her relations,
<PB N="28" REF="33">
who had the more encouraged her, as my father was a great match in point of for|tune, exa&s;perated at an error they ought rather to have charged them&s;elves with, &s;hut her up, and treated her with the ut|mo&s;t rigor."</P>
<P>" In this terrible &s;ituation &s;he was deli|vered of me; her relations took me in|&s;tantly from her &s;ight; they wrapt me in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful habiliments, and &s;ent me, with a letter full of the bittere&s;t threats and taunts, to my father. Far from feeling that indifference very young men u&s;ually behold their offspring with, he received me as the fir&s;t gift of Heaven, and, committing me to the charge of pro|per people, made me of no le&s;s con&s;e|quence than if I had been his legitimate daughter, and heire&s;s of his e&s;tate."</P>
<P>"In the mean time my mother was kept in total ignorance of the fate of her child; mi&s;erable in her own heart, and eternally taunted for the di&s;grace &s;he had brought on her family, &s;he at length re|&s;olved to make her e&s;cape to Lord Scroope; &mdash;&s;he effected it, and found in
<PB N="29" REF="34">
his hou&s;e the trea&s;ure of all her hopes, her child; but as &s;he was not of an age to be independent, on her being di&s;covered by her kindred, &s;he was again torn from his arms, and I was forever bereaved of a mother before I was &s;en&s;ible I had one. How often did my father repent his in|ju&s;tice to her! it hung heavy on his &s;oul in life, and was mo&s;t terrible in death. In vain he &s;ought her, for never from that hour did Heaven permit the erring pair to meet. A few years afterwards he married, and had by his wife the pre&s;ent Lord; this circum&s;tance, far from le&s;&s;ening his affec|tion, endeared me &s;till more to him; he remembered I had no fortune but from his bounty, no claim but on his heart. His Lady having no more children, be|gan to con&s;ider me as her daughter, and the misfortune of my birth was almo&s;t forgotten. In this &s;ituation I grew up, care&s;&s;ed by all his friends, and admired infinitely more than I de&s;erved; for from the time my brother grew of an age to appear in the world, Lord Scroope had left St. Vincent's Abbey for the Court.
<PB N="30" REF="35">
Many matches offered, of which my fa|ther often entreated me to chu&s;e. I how|ever, &s;aw no man with a preference; and as I was &s;en&s;ible my heart was too tender not to become partial, I wi&s;hed to evade all propo&s;als 'till then. I had in this in|terval the misfortune to lo&s;e my father, who&s;e &s;en&s;es failing him in his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s, he had no power to make a nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for me; yet' in his delirium he raved of me and my mother continually. I felt this lo&s;s the le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly, as I was treated with the utmo&s;t genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s by my brother and the dowa|ger Lady Scroope; but I found my train of admirers dimini&s;h apace, when one appeared, who atoned in my eyes for the lo&s;s of a thou&s;and. He was a young We&s;t-|Indian, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable for|tune, an amiable per&s;on, and an untainted heart. When I &s;ay I loved him, I &s;peak but coldly; you will know how well here|after. Mr. Colville, for that was his name, was of a character too much re|&s;embling the young Lord Scroope's, not to be favoured by him. He proved by
<PB N="31" REF="36">
the genero&s;ity or his behaviour, the &s;ince|rity of his love; neither the misfortune of my birth, or want of riches, dimi|ni&s;hed his ardor; but rather, on the con|trary, augmented it. His fortune was independent, and I was not de&s;irous of more than a very moderate, competence. The day of our marriage was fixed, and arrived equally wi&s;hed by both. We were united in the pre&s;ence of the Lord and Lady Scroope, who had loaded me with noble pre&s;ents. Our hearts were gay, and a large company a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion, invented a thou&s;and diver&s;ions. I was &s;itting after dinner at the head of the table, &s;inging, when a &s;ervant entered and whi&s;pered my hu&s;band; he ro&s;e up, and followed him into the next room; my eyes were indu&s;trious to find him, and as he left the door open, I perceived him, from an oppo&s;ite pier gla&s;s, take a packet of letters from a man, he held them in his hand 'till I cea&s;ed &s;inging, and then began reading: he continued to do &s;o &s;ome minutes, when I &s;aw his hand &s;hake with great; violence, which &s;oon di|mini&s;hing,

<P>(Mrs. Marlow was &s;o affected at this pa&s;&s;age, &s;he had not power to proceed; at la&s;t recovering, &s;he held up her hands, while her &s;ine eyes were drowned in tears, and repeated)</P>

Dur|ing the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he found her&s;elf again with child; her kin&s;man, exa&s;perated at this circum&s;tance, u&s;ed every means to pre|vail on her to marry Mr. Colville (a &s;ettler who&s;e plantations joined his, and who was a pa&s;&s;enger on board-the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el) without acquainting him with her &s;ituation. Per|&s;ecuted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, &s;he at la&s;t took a re&s;olution on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, to declare all to her lover. His a&s;&s;iduity furni&s;hed her with one ere long, which &s;he did not neglect. As &s;oon as he had conquered his &s;urpri&s;e, he a&s;&s;ured her &s;he &s;hould never repent her generous confidence in his honor, which affected him the more &s;en&s;ibly as his friend would meanly have deceived him. He owned him&s;elf &s;o attached, that if &s;he could give up fruitle&s;s hopes to partake his fortune, he would marry her directly, with|out claiming any right from the ceremony,

Some days elap&s;ed, during which, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;ecure to her&s;elf the privilege of keeping <HI>one</HI> of her children, by con&s;enting. They were united by a holy father then on board, who, at Mr. Colville's de&s;ire, gave out he had married them two months before in London, but concealed it from &s;ome motives re&s;pecting the lady's friends. Her uncle, under who&s;e care &s;he was, not &s;u&s;pecting the eclairci&s;&s;ement, was a&s;toni&s;hed how &s;he had brought her lover to con&s;ent to this; but, as his authority was at an end by her compliance with his wi&s;hes, he affected the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction, and offered them &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents,

Mr. Colville, who&s;e ingenuous heart ab|horred his meanne&s;s, refu&s;ed with con|tempt tho&s;e poor compen&s;ations, for a deceit which might have proved &s;o fatal to his happine&s;s, nor left him to &s;uppo&s;e he was ignorant of the favor intended him. He painted the infamy of the pro|ceeding in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and on their arrival at Jamaica, carried his bride to his own plantation, without deigning to take leave of her relation. "Here, &s;aid the dear lady, I gave birth, my &s;on, to you, and here I fir&s;t learnt to be happy.

<P>"We were removed to &s;eparate apart|ments; Mr. Colville, no longer my hu&s;|band, had &s;trength of con&s;titution, but not &s;trength of mind, to &s;upport this ca|lamity; he fell into a deep melancholy, and &s;hut him&s;elf from all the world: as to me, Heaven, in mercy, took away my &s;en&s;es by a violent fever; I remained in a dangerous &s;ituation &s;everal weeks, during which time he formed a re&s;olu|tion, my re&s;teration gave him opportu|nity to effect.

Before I left my room, my Lord's marriage with the Lady Matilda Howard was concluded; his union with the fir&s;t Lady in England, both in birth and beauty, gave the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to all who loved him.

Before, the re|membrance that the blow came from her, however unintentionally, gave me a little courage, which I was not &s;ure I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed till it was lo&s;t. There is a plea&s;ure to hearts capable of refinement, in &s;acrificing &s;omething to the friends we love; the &s;i|lence we endured to &s;ave her from di&s;tre&s;s had le&s;&s;ened mine, which now broke forth anew. The amiable Lady Scroope neg|lected nothing to &s;often it; &s;he u&s;ed every effort to prevent my retiring to the mo|na&s;tery, as I had purpo&s;ed; her influence over her Lord made her wi&s;hes too &s;urely his for him to neglect adding his intrea|ties; the obligations I owed his family, the e&s;teem I had for his Lady, and the very refinement I have mentioned, made me unable to refu&s;e. I could never make too large amends for &s;uch kindne&s;s. My &s;i&s;ter-in-law, who rather boa&s;ted than di&s;owned the title, to gratify me, neg|lected the amu&s;ements natural to her years, and a mind at ea&s;e; it &s;eemed as if I had the authority ve&s;ted in her, and
<PB N="42" REF="47">
not her will, but mine, directed the fami|ly. Our gue&s;ts departed by degrees, and Lady Scroope's brother, the young Duke of Norfolk, with &s;ome other relations, alone remained.</P>
<P>"To &s;atisfy my brother Anthony no le|vity had era&s;ed from my mind the tender ties which once united us, and which neither time nor rea&s;on could ever entirely di&s;&s;olve, I laid before him the motives of my conduct, and conjured him to be|lieve, &s;ince I could never be his, I never would be another's. Lady Scroope not being able to prevail on me to return to London, departed without me, after ex|torting a promi&s;e, that I would think no more of a nunnery. She had left the Abbey three months, when &s;he gave birth to the pre&s;ent Lord, to the inexpre&s;|&s;ible joy of her hu&s;band. To &s;hew all the gratitude in my power for the favors I had received both from Lord Scroope and his mother, I divided my fortune, and in|&s;i&s;ted on their accepting half, as a pre&s;ent to the young heir. The generous Matilda would have returned it, but her Lord,
<PB N="43" REF="48">
more &s;en&s;ible of the value of money, re|ceived the gift. She reproached me for it with that kind raillery which friends know how to make &s;o agreeable; &s;he told me &s;he &s;hould cea&s;e to love me, &s;ince the world would now call her attachment in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the time of her ab&s;ence, I &s;pent many hours in reviewing the ruins with which this place abounded; the gloomy mag|nificence of tho&s;e great remains of art, was more &s;uited to my &s;adne&s;s of &s;oul than the &s;ofter and more varied &s;cenes of nature; the liking I had conceived for the&s;e places, doubtle&s;s fir&s;t cau&s;ed the hou&s;ekeeper to &s;hew me the Rece&s;s. She had lived in the family a va&s;t number of years, and knew the &s;ecret. How often had I walked through its ruined ailes, without &s;u&s;pecting it could po&s;|&s;ibly contain one habitable &s;pot! I will now, my dear children, explain its &s;ituation and &s;tructure: &mdash;It was once inhabited by nuns of the order of St. Winifred, but de&s;erted before the
<PB N="44" REF="49">
abolition of Convents, from its ruinous condition; in this &s;ituation it remained many years, &s;hunned by the country peo|ple, and devoutly vi&s;ited by tho&s;e tra|vellers whom chance or curio&s;ity brought this way. When the Reformation, in the time of Henry, robbed the monks of their va&s;t domains, the ance&s;tor of Lord Scroope obtained this land of the King; he pulled down the mona&s;tery to erect a convenient man&s;ion in the &s;ame ta&s;te, and di&s;covered a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age from thence to the Convent; it was blocked up without being generally known, and the ruins left as an addition to the pro&s;|pect; nor till chance gave the commu|nication a value, was it remembered. The nobleman who could obtain &s;o va&s;t a favor, 'tis needle&s;s to mention, pro|fe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion, but not able to forget that in which he had been brought up, his hou&s;e became the a&s;ylum of many of the unrevenued fathers; this circum&s;tance being noticed, he found his views in the world depended on his ex|pelling them, when the &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age oc|curred
<PB N="45" REF="50">
to his remembrance. He had the &s;tones removed cautiou&s;ly by the holy fa|thers, and found the place well arched and paved, and free from damps; it termina|ted in a room they &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the refectory, and which &s;till re|mained entire. They removed, by de|grees, &s;uch accommodations as were ne|ce&s;&s;ary into it, and thither the refugees retired, being &s;upplied with food from the Abbey; but finding them&s;elves &s;hut up in too &s;mall a place, and in total want of employment, they began working under ground, and by degrees formed two other pa&s;&s;ages from the Rece&s;s, one of which ends in the Hermit's cave, where the elde&s;t of them lived, and the other in the mid&s;t of the ruins. Thus providing again&s;t di&s;covery, or rather &s;ecuring their e&s;cape if that &s;hould happen. In &s;urvey|ing the ruins, they found &s;everal places enclo&s;ed, and yet undemoli&s;hed; from among tho&s;e, they &s;elected the few we have lived in, chu&s;ing them always &s;e|parated to prevent &s;u&s;picion. Thus, in a few years, each father had his own
<PB N="46" REF="51">
cell, and a mona&s;tery was hid among the ruins of the convent. At length, the &s;everity of government abating, &s;everal of the monks ventured again into the world, and of the eight who made it their a&s;ylum, two only ended their days here. Lord Scroope, &s;en&s;ible of the va|lue of &s;uch a retirement, carefully kept the &s;ecret when its inhabitants were gone; two &s;ervants alone knew it, and they were faithful; nor till the hou&s;e-keeper told me the &s;tory, had I an idea of &s;uch a place.</P>
<P>This account appeared almo&s;t fabulous to me; &mdash;the ruin was at lea&s;t half a mile from the man&s;ion, which then had a view of it ri&s;ing plantations daily dimini&s;hed, till the wood became frequented, or indeed pa&s;&s;able only on the &s;ide near the Hermit's cave: I impatiently de&s;ired to explore the whole romantic &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper did not delay a mo|ment to gratify my curio&s;ity; &s;he &s;um|moned an old &s;ervant who knew the way, with torches, to lead me through the windings. The arched roof which was,
<PB N="47" REF="52">
by &s;ome contrivance in the building, kept a&s;toni&s;hingly free from damps, echoed to our very feet. The gloomi|ne&s;s of the &s;cene accorded with my ideas, and &s;ugge&s;ted a &s;cheme which I have &s;ince thought a providential one, to my mind. The divi&s;ion of the rooms, the bare walls, and holes in the roof for air, di&s;plea&s;ed me; but &s;ince my affection for Lord and Lady Scroope debarred me from de|voting my&s;elf to a convent, I re&s;olved to fit this place up, and retire to it whenever the owners, with their gue&s;ts, made St. Vincent's Abbey too gay for me. Three times I vi&s;ited it, and each time found my de&s;ire greater. I di&s;cour&s;ed with the old man, who, from a con&s;iderable re|ward I offered him, agreed, with the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of his &s;on, who was a builder, to ren|der this a comfortable habitation. I was unwilling to admit a third per&s;on into the &s;ecret, but &s;oon di&s;covered his &s;on James was already acquainted with it. They directly began lodging their implements in the cave, which was altered to give a face to the whole. Three months made
<PB N="48" REF="53">
it what it now is; charmed with a de|vice which I little fore&s;aw would be u&s;e|ful to my friends, the hou&s;e-keeper and my maid Alice, brought, by my direc|tion, every nece&s;&s;ary to the dark room, from whence the men fetched them. The time of my Lord's return drew nigh, the place was aired, and my books and clothes already carried there; no &s;ooner had I re&s;igned the care of the family into the hands of my amiable &s;i&s;ter, than I acquainted her with my intended retreat. Her &s;urpri&s;e was extreme at &s;eeing how commodious we had rendered &s;o &s;e|que&s;tered a &s;pot; but being fearful, if &s;he oppo&s;ed my re&s;olution, of &s;eeming to con&s;train me, &s;he &s;uffered me to indulge my fancy. Hither then I retired, at|tended by Alice and James, the latter of whom lived in the cave to &s;ecure us from di&s;covery, and furni&s;h us every little convenience. This &s;olitude, &s;o &s;uitable to the &s;adne&s;s of my &s;oul, was inexpre&s;|&s;ibly agreeable to me; it had all the ad|vantages of a nunnery, without the tie
<PB N="49" REF="54">
to continue in it; a re&s;triction the mo&s;t likely to make retirement odious. My brother Anthony (with whom I con&s;tantly corre&s;ponded) charmed with the de&s;crip|tion of a &s;pot &s;o well calculated for hearts wounded like his and mine, a&s;&s;ured me, in&s;tead of &s;hutting him&s;elf up in a con|vent, for which he felt he had no voca|tion, as &s;oon as he thought he could bring him&s;elf to con&s;ider me only as a &s;i&s;ter, he would fix his re&s;idence in the cave.</P>
<P>I had remained there two months, when a me&s;&s;enger arrived to recall Lord Scroope to Court; the cau&s;e could not remain a &s;ecret. Mary of Scotland, that beautiful and unfortunate Queen, who had been impri&s;oned by her &s;ubjects as an acce&s;&s;ary to the murder of her hu&s;band, had found means to e&s;cape, and implore the protection of Elizabeth. The jea|lou&s;y and hatred that prince&s;s had long entertained for one &s;o &s;uperior in tho&s;e endowments mo&s;t admired by her&s;elf, made this &s;tep excu&s;able in Mary, only
<PB N="50" REF="55">
from the cruelty of her &s;ituation. But did not that very &s;ituation entitle her to royal treatment? In Elizabeth many noble qualities are mingled with impati|ence, caprice, pride, and exce&s;&s;ive vanity. Overjoyed at getting a rival into her hands, doubly formidable, in&s;tead of offering Mary a princely a&s;ylum, till, on the proof of her innocence, &s;he &s;hould be re&s;tored to her crown, Elizabeth in&s;tantly made the Queen of Scots &s;en&s;ible of her power, by dropping tho&s;e ardent expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem with which all her letters had before been filled (mo&s;t pro|bably to hide the very rever&s;e) and in&s;i&s;t|ing on her con&s;enting to be tried by laws, with which &s;he was unacquainted, and never yet &s;ubject to. It was to propo&s;e tho&s;e har&s;h terms to Mary, the Queen had &s;ent for Lord Scroope; &s;he deputed him in concert with the duke of Norfolk, and &s;everal other Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners, to receive from Mary her ju&s;tification, and examine into the authenticity of the proofs.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">The de&s;erted, nay, almo&s;t betrayed Queen of Scotland, too late found how little the profe&s;&s;ions of the great are to be relied on. She was now in a wor&s;e con|dition than if &s;he had &s;till remained in her own country, and &s;ubmitted to laws by which &s;he had governed. Compelled, by the &s;everity of her fate, to bend to a woman but equal with her&s;elf; to give her&s;elf up a pri&s;oner to a government &s;he had never offended, and over which &s;he was probably de&s;tined to reign; as a cri|minal, to attempt a ju&s;tification before people too probably ordered to condemn her, and, even if they avoided that, too politic to clear her innocence, and re|&s;tore her freedom: For the Queen of En|gland had already placed a number of peo|ple around her, who watched all her &s;teps &s;o cautiou&s;ly, that they wanted only the name to become a guard. Amid all the&s;e fears and mortifications, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was Mary's only mea&s;ure. She had learnt, young as &s;he was, to &s;ubmit with dignity, and demand a degree of genero&s;ity, by not &s;eeming to doubt of finding it. She there|fore
<PB N="52" REF="57">
received the Queen's plea&s;ure with compo&s;ure, delivered her&s;elf into Lord Scroope's hands, and agreed to defer ap|pearing before her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, 'till &s;he could appear with honor.</P>
<P>This great event engro&s;&s;ed the atten|tion of all Europe. Various opinions were formed, and Elizabeth never found Mary more formidable than when in her power. All blamed her errors, but they pitied her youth, and imputed many of them to inexperience and faults in her education. Her uncommon beauty, af|fability, elegance of manners, and ex|pre&s;&s;ion, were &s;trongly commended by all who had &s;een her, and tho&s;e who had not, li&s;tened to the tale with avidity, and re|ported it with increa&s;e. Every word in her prai&s;e was a dagger to the heart of Eliza|beth, and the unfortunate Mary's greate&s;t crimes with her, were the graces &s;he re|ceived from nature.</P>
<P>Lady Scroope had &s;pent &s;ome of her early years in the French Court. Mary was too affable and amiable not to attach every one for whom &s;he had an inclina|tion,
<PB N="53" REF="58">
and the friend&s;hip &s;he &s;hewed for the Lady Matilda, would have made the &s;eparation the more afflicting, but that Mary, by the death of Francis the &s;econd, found her&s;elf no longer attached to France, and was obliged, with infinite regret, to quit the kingdom &s;he had been educated in, to govern one filled with do|me&s;tic jars, and almo&s;t ignorant of tho&s;e &s;oftne&s;&s;es which give charms to &s;oci|ety; and which, in a peculiar degree, adorned the court &s;he had hitherto reigned over.</P>
<P>The troubles in which &s;he had been plunged, from the hour &s;he returned to Scotland, had &s;carce given her lei&s;ure to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e &s;he had formerly honored with her notice: Lady Scroope had, how|ever, always pre&s;erved an attachment to her, le&s;s the fruit of gratitude than &s;ym|pathy. The Queen's pre&s;ent &s;ad &s;itua|tion, of which &s;he heard amply from her Lord, touched her to the very &s;oul. She accu&s;ed Elizabeth of meanne&s;s and inju&s;|tice; and, without doubting the inno|cence of Mary, &s;he ardently de&s;ired to
<PB N="54" REF="59">
lighten her captivity, and convince her, that misfortune had not robbed her of every friend. The&s;e &s;entiments were too fervently generous not to engage me. I in&s;en&s;ibly took part in what intere&s;ted my &s;i&s;ter &s;o nearly, and learnt to deplore a Prince&s;s thus treated, whom, in a happier &s;ituation, I &s;hould doubtle&s;s have cen|&s;ured.</P>
<P>Lord Scroope, to &s;atisfy his wife, who entreated him to the &s;tep, repre&s;ented to Elizabeth, the impropriety of leaving the Queen of Scots unaccompanied by any lady of di&s;tinction, and without the at|tendance, nothing could exempt the place &s;he had cho&s;en for an a&s;ylum, from pay|ing her, whether guilty or innocent. To give force to this, he hinted the error of har&s;h mea&s;ures, which intere&s;ted the com|mon people, and by engaging their pity, might weaken their fidelity.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rea&s;on, weighed infinitely more with our Queen than the fir&s;t, for her heart was more full of policy than feeling. She however appointed Lady Scroope to
<PB N="55" REF="60">
attend upon Mary, and &s;ent orders to treat her more &s;uitably to her rank.</P>
<P>Overjoyed at carrying her point, with|out appearing in it, Lady Scroope did not delay her journey; but unwilling to leave me, &s;he u&s;ed all her intere&s;t and in|fluence to per&s;uade me to accompany her. She repre&s;ented, &s;he did not wi&s;h to en|gage me in any gay &s;cenes, the office &s;he was allotted to, being that mo&s;t conform|able to the melancholy turn of my mind. The inclination I had to &s;ee Mary joined with her, and I con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Bolton Ca&s;tle, whither Mary had been conducted by the Queen's command, was a &s;trong fortre&s;s on the borders of York|&s;hire; without furniture, or accommoda|tions for a royal gue&s;t, it declared at once to that Prince&s;s, the melancholy captivity to which &s;he was de&s;tined. The huma|nity of Lord Scroope in vain attempted to conceal the fate that awaited her; &s;he gave her&s;elf up to an immoderate grief, which was augmented by the news of Bothwell's death, who had taken refuge in Norway.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="61">We were met at Derby by the Duke of Norfolk, who&s;e ardent de&s;ire to &s;ee the Queen of Scots had induced him to join us. This nobleman was of an amiable pre&s;ence, in the prime of life, full of a ge|nerous ardor, a captivating vivacity. Without an equal in rank in England, he had formed, long &s;ince, the de&s;ign of e&s;pou&s;ing Mary, and Both well's death had renewed hopes her marriage with him had fru&s;trated. I was amazed at the difference vi&s;ible in the manners of the Duke; nor did I immediately perceive whence his impati|ence of any di&s;appointment, and deep reveries could proceed; but the plea&s;ure he took in hearing his &s;i&s;ter's commen|dations of the Queen, the &s;oftne&s;s that &s;parkled in his eyes, while he related the events her letters to Bothwell had laid open, &s;hewed me, that ambition had rai&s;ed a flame in his heart, he mi&s;took for love.</P>
<P>We arrived at Bolton, and Mary was not apprized, till Lady Scroope was in|troduced to her pre&s;ence, that Elizabeth had &s;ent her a friend &s;o anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous
<PB N="57" REF="62">
to lighten her captivity. I would de&s;cribe the Queen of Scotland to you, my dear children, had not nature drawn a truer pic|ture of her than I can give. &mdash;Look in the gla&s;s, Matilda, and you will &s;ee her perfect image.</P>
<P>I could not contain my a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash; "Oh heavens! exclaimed I, is it po&s;&s;ible, in lamenting the fate of that injured Queen, I have wept for a mother!"</P>
<P>"A &s;hort time will explain all, &s;aid Mrs. Marlow. The Queen was in the bloom of youth, and the &s;orrow which hung over her features, gave them an irre&s;i&s;tible attraction. Her air of re&s;igned dignity and feminine &s;weetne&s;s, was mingled with innocence and uncon&s;cious mode&s;ty. If I was inclined to pity her before, how greatly was that &s;entiment enlivened! Her faults &s;eemed to vani&s;h, or to be atoned by her misfortunes. Nothing could be more intere&s;ting than her fir&s;t interview with Lady Scroope, who&s;e tears alone could expre&s;s her &s;orrow and affec|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="63">How mu&s;t a &s;cene, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, touch a heart prepared to love her! The Duke found there was a pa&s;&s;ion &s;tronger than ambition; her crown no longer engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts, it was her&s;elf alone he de&s;ired; he lamented the evils it had overwhelmed her with, and from which, even her re&s;ignation of it, would not relieve her. Love commu|nicated all its delicacies at once to his heart; and the man who had dared a&s;pire to her, while in pro&s;perity and peace, in this &s;ad moment of humiliation had not pre&s;umption to lift his eyes to her, to &s;peak of his affection, or in&s;ult her by his com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Scroope was too quick-&s;ighted to overlook this change in her brother; but far from drawing any ill pre&s;age from it, &s;he flattered her&s;elf he was de&s;tined to re|&s;tore the Queen, and to find in her grati|tude and affection, a reward proportioned to his merit.</P>
<P>Willing to relieve the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the hours, that Lady devi&s;ed amu&s;ements of which no one partook, though all, from
<PB N="59" REF="64">
a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the intention, appeared &s;atisfied with them. The &s;ilence and me|lancholy of the Duke of Norfolk engaged the Queen; &s;he found it a delicate com|pliment to her di&s;tre&s;s, and regarded him with an attention too flattering to be over|looked. &mdash;Charmed with an e&s;teem, which he had rather wi&s;hed than hoped, the ar|dor of his &s;oul found words, and Mary di&s;covered, in attempting to attach a friend, &s;he had gained a lover. Con&s;i|dering her intere&s;t only, &s;he mu&s;t have encouraged him; but, remembering how fatal her partiality might one day prove, &s;he conjured him to &s;ubdue while yet in its infancy, a pa&s;&s;ion it would be cru|elty to encourage; to remember her only as an unfortunate friend, and in that light, confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf obliged to him for his intere&s;t and power in her favor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t wildne&s;s of love, nothing &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible; an an&s;wer &s;o mild, only animated the hope it was meant to extin|gui&s;h. He formed a thou&s;and projects, he engaged his &s;i&s;ter in his intere&s;t, and
<PB N="60" REF="65">
every hour of his life was filled up by plans for the deliverance of the amiable Queen. But as it was impo&s;&s;ible his re&s;idence &s;hould be a &s;ecret, and he ju&s;tly feared awakening the attention of Elizabeth, be|fore his &s;chemes were ripe for execution, he engaged his &s;i&s;ter to make a reque&s;t, he wanted courage to mention; &s;ince &s;he might, with more propriety, repre&s;ent to the Queen, the policy of rendering her fate his.</P>
<P>In this dangerous conjuncture, the unfortunate Mary li&s;tened once more to the partial advice of her heart; which prompted her to yield to &s;o noble, &s;o de|&s;erving a lover. She had caught his frenzy, and realized the fictions of his brain with the &s;ame facility. His va&s;t e&s;tates, numerous va&s;&s;als, and &s;till more, his ex|tended and noble connexions, flattered her with the hope of amply rewarding him, and &s;he thought it but generous to let the recompence rather precede the &s;ervice than follow it.</P>
<P>Fatal delu&s;ion of a prejudiced mind! Oh Mary, too tender Prince&s;s! why were
<PB N="61" REF="66">
not all the pa&s;t misfortunes of thy life, which had their &s;ource in love, monitors to thee? Why did they not teach thee to avoid this error, which heightened every affliction, and gave new pangs to a long, long captivity?</P>
<P>The Duke not daring to engage his brother-in-law in an action contrary to his commi&s;&s;ion, entru&s;ted his intention only to his &s;i&s;ter. Too ardent and too amiable an advocate to be denied, the Queen of Scots was per&s;uaded by that Lady to unite her&s;elf with the Duke. They were married in the pre&s;ence of the Lady Scroope and my&s;elf, Sir Arthur Fore&s;ter, and the Duke's two Secretaries.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her&s;elf of all his wi&s;hes, the pri&s;on of the Queen became a palace to the Duke; and every hour &s;eemed to add to a pa&s;&s;ion, which appeared at fir&s;t incapable of addition. The authority Mary had given him over her, the tenderne&s;s with which &s;he regarded him, were powerful motives again&s;t the approaching &s;eparation; but Lady Scroope &s;aw with concern, the ex|travagance of a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had encou|raged.
<PB N="62" REF="67">
She knew too well the temper of Elizabeth, not to anticipate her re&s;ent|ment, if this &s;tep was di&s;covered, and knew likewi&s;e his own &s;afety would be a poor motive, for per&s;uading her brother to leave Bolton; &s;he therefore repre&s;ented to him, how ill he rewarded the lovely Queen of Scots, by lengthening an impri&s;onment it was his duty to curtail; and a&s;ked him what expectation Mary might form from a hu&s;band, who already preferred his own indulgence, to her freedom, happine&s;s, and glory?</P>
<P>The&s;e reproaches were too true to of|fend the Duke. He lamented, but yielded to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity. Mary, as if fore|warned that the&s;e hours were all the ea&s;y ones remaining of her life, u&s;ed every means to detain him; but the genero&s;ity of her affection, awakening his more &s;trongly, he bade adieu to the charming wife, he was never more to meet, and &s;et out for London, to engage all his friends to favor a marriage, no one now could prevent. He flattered him&s;elf, his intere&s;t
<PB N="63" REF="68">
was &s;o great, that the Queen would be reduced to con&s;ent, whether con&s;onant to her inclination or not. Indeed, this was the only rational mode of proceeding; for to imagine Elizabeth weak enough to unite her rival and heire&s;s, voluntarily, to the fir&s;t of her &s;ubjects, would have been an unpardonable blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Fortune, however, had de&s;tined other|wi&s;e, and only &s;miled awhile, to make her frown more terrible. All the great Lords of Elizabeth's Court, who had &s;een, with regret, the impri&s;onment of Mary, entered with plea&s;ure into Norfolk's &s;chemes. His letters were filled with the mo&s;t flattering hopes, and the Queen, who was with child, gave him notice of it. This circum&s;tance added to his joy; he promi&s;ed, before the time of her deli|very, &s;he &s;hould have her pri&s;on gates opened by all the nobility of England. The Earls of Shrew&s;bury, Derby, Bed|ford, Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland, Pembroke, Southampton, Arundel, and Suffex, had warmly engaged in his cau&s;e; and their Names alone would influence

many. But the friend he mo&s;t relied upon, was the Earl of Leice&s;ter, who&s;e a&s;cendancy over the Queen was well known; he had taken on him&s;elf the di&s;|clo&s;ure of the whole to Elizabeth, when that mea&s;ure became nece&s;&s;ary. In the mean time, Norfolk u&s;ed every means to prevent the Regent of Scotland from ac|cu&s;ing Mary to the Queen; nor was his artifice un&s;ucce&s;sful. Murray, after hav|ing entered England for no other purpo&s;e, &s;uddenly returned, without taking any &s;tep in the bu&s;ine&s;s; a circum&s;tance, which defeated all the mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h Court.

<P>My &s;i&s;ter &s;till followed her, nor could I de&s;ert her in &s;uch a &s;ituation. We had hoped, from the information of the Duke, to find the Earl of Shrew&s;bury inclined to favor her; but whether he fore&s;aw the end of this unfortunate project, or had deceived Norfolk, he kept a &s;trict watch

over the Queen's actions, who&s;e condi|tion now confined her to her apartment.</P>
<P>The Duke, flattered by Murray's re|treat, commi&s;&s;ioned &s;ome of his friends in Scotland, to &s;ound that nobleman on the &s;ubject of his marriage; they unwa|rily laid open more than he intended, and Murray, enraged at having been his dupe, &s;ent notice of the plot to Elizabeth. She was on a vi&s;it to Lord Leice&s;ter, who was ill, when the letter arrived; and con|fiding to that favorite, the cau&s;e of her agitation, he &s;ent, while the Queen was con&s;ulting with Cecil, to warn Norfolk to retreat, as Elizabeth &s;eemed bent on committing him to the Tower. Thun|der&s;truck at this unexpected di&s;covery, the Duke &s;et out, with precipitation, for his &s;eat of Kenning-Hall; but, reflecting on the road, that his flight was a &s;tronger proof again&s;t him than the accu&s;ation of his enemies, he returned directly; he was however met by &s;ome officers, &s;ent in pur&s;uit of him, and conducted to Burn|ham.</P>

His Secretary po&s;ted off to Tutbury with an account of all the&s;e proceedings. They &s;unk the deeper into the heart of the Queen, as &s;he hoped, by this time, to have been at liberty. She was every hour in expectation of an event which mu&s;t publi&s;h her marriage, or load her with infamy. In this hard trial, Lady Scroope &s;ugge&s;ted to her the only &s;afe way of proceeding; which was, to convey her child, by the Duke's Secretary, im|mediately after its birth, out of the Ca&s;tle, and concealing the cau&s;e of her indi&s;po&s;i|tion, wait a more favorable moment for avowing her marriage. This was the only plan to avoid injuring the Duke's &s;afety, or her own honor. To prepare every thing again&s;t the time, I took my leave of the Queen, as returning to St. Vincent's Abbey; and retiring to a neigh|bouring hut hired on purpo&s;e, waited with my maid, to receive the infant &s;he &s;hould bring into the world, which was to be car|ried to the Rece&s;s, and placed under my care, till the fate of its parents could be a&s;certained.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="72">
This &s;ad moment was ha&s;tened by a &s;adder event:&mdash;Bothwell, who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be dead, found means to convey a letter to the Queen, a&s;&s;uring her the re|port was &s;pread only to quiet the Scots, who otherwi&s;e would never have &s;uffered him to re&s;t; and that he waited in Den|mark till the divi&s;ions of her kingdom &s;hould enable him to rai&s;e a powerful party, and attempt her deliverance. Mary, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of the well known hand, felt all the horrors of her fate; &s;he fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions, which were &s;ucceeded by the pains of labor. She gave birth to two girls&mdash;for you, my dear children, are the fruit of this fatal marriage, who, &s;carce had been held to the bo&s;om of a mother, before you were divided from it, I fear, for ever.</P>
<P>The faithful Secretary conveyed you with the tendere&s;t caution to me. When he repeated this &s;ad tale, oh! how my &s;oul wept for the ill-fated Queen! I vowed ye &s;hould be mine, for ye were the children of misfortune, and never, never have I broke that vow; di&s;tre&s;s en|deared

You were cherubs in your infancy, and grew up to chear my days, and embelli&s;h my &s;oli|tude. Full of the great charge ve&s;ted in my hands, I &s;ought the earlie&s;t opportu|nity of quitting a dangerous place; I brought you &s;afe to this &s;pot, attended by Alice, after having you baptized Matilda, the elder (which you was by a few mi|nutes) after Lady Scroope, and Ellinor after the Duke's mother.</P>
<P>To return to the Queen of Scots:&mdash; She langui&s;hed a long time between ill-|health and de&s;pair; but the Duke found means to a&s;&s;ure her that this misfortune &s;hould not long &s;eparate them. He applied now to the Pope to annul Mary's former marriage with Bothwell; the Pope hop|ing to find &s;ome great advantage in the projected union, &s;eemed inclined to grant his reque&s;t; but the conditions he im|po&s;ed
<PB N="69" REF="74">
were &s;o hard, that the Duke had no hope.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Elizabeth finding an effectual bar placed between Mary and Norfolk by Bothwell's being yer alive, and having &s;ome hopes from the ill-health of the Queen of Scots, of &s;eeing an end of her fears, after conveying her to Coventry, &s;he relea&s;ed the Duke, at the interce&s;&s;ion of his con&s;tant friend Lord Leice&s;ter. Sen&s;ible of the ra&s;hne&s;s of his former con|duct, he re&s;olved to avoid that fault, and made no attempt to &s;ee the Queen of Scots, employing him&s;elf in hunting and diver&s;ions at Kenning-Hall, till the &s;pies of Elizabeth, per&s;uaded he had laid a&s;ide his projects, gave up their employment. The Duke pa&s;t from the &s;eat of one friend to that of another, to appearance in &s;earch of amu&s;ement, but in reality to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of their attachment; and, as if by accident, to vi&s;it St. Vincent's Abbey, and embrace the daughters of his love.

<P>The Duke departed the next day, and in a &s;hort time, Elizabeth having appointed the Lords Huntingdon and Hereford in the room of Lord Scroope, the Queen of Scots was deprived of her only comfort, by the departure of his Lady.</P>
<P>The Duke, finding gentle attempts in|effectual, re&s;olved on a mea&s;ure he deem|ed infallible, and entered into a treaty with a tru&s;ty Spaniard named Ridolpho, to engage the Duke of Alva to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with ten thou&s;and men, to be landed at Harwich, from whence they were to march to London, to intimidate Eliza|beth. The Duke of Alva con&s;ented,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
and even the Pope at length a&s;hamed of neutrality, took a &s;hare in Mary's de|liverance. Every thing was prepared; Norfolk's friends in England only waited the &s;ignal to join him, when one of tho&s;e trifling accidents which di&s;concert the wi&s;e&s;t &s;chemes, rendered this in a moment abortive.</P>
<P>To foment the divi&s;ions in Scotland &s;o much as to keep the Regent employed, and prevent him from interfering in the affair, the Duke &s;ent many &s;ums to be &s;cattered among the Queen's friends, in that kingdom, at different times; &mdash;but now when the cri&s;is approached, he had prepared a large bag of gold, which with a letter, he unfortunately tru&s;ted to a man quite ignorant of the plot; the carrier, in putting it up, by &s;ome accident cut the bag, and the contents filling him with a&s;toni&s;hment, he communicated this &s;in|gular di&s;covery to a &s;ervant of Lord Bur|leigh's, who was his brother; this man, through a hope of getting the gold be|tween them, and &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome my&s;tery was hid in the letter, per&s;uaded him to
<PB N="74" REF="79">
&s;hew it to his ma&s;ter; the carrier con|&s;ented, and Lord Burleigh ea&s;ily per|ceiving the plot, though not its ex|tent, communicated it to the Queen; in con&s;equence of which the Duke was arre&s;ted in his bed, and all his &s;ervants impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>This fatal &s;troke overturned every re|maining hope; betrayed by his &s;ervants, all the letters he had written and received on that &s;ubject, mo&s;t of which he had or|dered to be burnt, were produced again&s;t him; his very benevolence was con&s;trued into a crime, and &s;ome money he &s;ent to the Counte&s;s of Northumberland, who was in exile and di&s;tre&s;s with her Lord, became an article in his impeachment. He was condemned, and heard, his &s;en|tence with a fortitude which melted Lord Shrew&s;bury, who pronounced it, into tears.</P>
<P>Lady Scroope, di&s;tracted at her bro|ther's fate, fell at the feet of the Queen, and left nothing un&s;aid to move her; but all &s;he could obtain was the deferring his execution, for Burleigh had &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="75" REF="80">
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Elizabeth with the idea that the Duke &s;ought her life, that although no circum&s;tance aro&s;e to confirm it on his trial, nothing could bani&s;h it from her mind.</P>
<P>But what was the &s;ituation of the Queen of Scotland at this completion of her misfortunes! An exile from her own country, a pri&s;oner in another, a wife without a right to that name, and a mother, while a &s;tranger to her children; her fate was wound up in the condemna|tion of her hu&s;band; and &s;he had the poig|nant affliction of knowing &s;he had rai&s;ed the axe again&s;t him, which all her tears could not avert. Pierced with de&s;pair, &s;he conjured the Lady Scroope to a&s;&s;ure the Queen &s;he would not only voluntarily con&s;ent to remain her pri&s;oner for life, but would give up her claim to the Crown of England, if her &s;i&s;ter (as &s;he was com|pelled to &s;tile her) would free the Duke: of Norfolk, and re&s;tore him to his ho|nors. This propo&s;al Elizabeth received: as a fine&s;&s;e, from which &s;he only &s;aw how
<PB N="76" REF="81">
deeply Mary's heart was linked with his. Even the all-prevailing Leice&s;ter's elo|quence failed; &s;elf-pre&s;ervation was an unconquerable principle in the &s;oul of Elizabeth.</P>
<P>The Duke was beheaded fourteen years ago, when you, my dear children, who were bought with his life, were not above two years and a half old. He died as he had lived, with dignity and honour.</P>
<P>Never was nobleman more lamented: he had endeared him&s;elf to the body of the people by his courage, genero&s;ity, and affability; and to his equals, by an un|con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority, which pre|vented envy, and an uniformity of con|duct, which gained admiration. He was the fir&s;t victim to the Queen's fears, nor could &s;he have cho&s;en one who&s;e merits were &s;tronger proofs of the value &s;he &s;et on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady Scroope dete&s;ting too late the ar|tifices of the Court, and &s;unk in affliction for the lo&s;s of a brother &s;he adored, retired
<PB N="77" REF="82">
hither with her Lord, who had thrown up his employments. Her body partook of the debility of her mind, and &s;oon gave &s;ymptoms of a decay, which reduced her to the grave.</P>
<P>Her temper too was quite changed. This Rece&s;s, which &s;o lately appeared a horrible dungeon, now &s;eemed to her, as to me, a calm retirement from the odious forms and cares of life. She &s;pent many days, (and would every one, had it not afflicted her Lord) in weeping over you; in tracing in Matilda the mildly-beautiful features of her friend, and in Ellinor, the captivating graces of her brother. 'Tis to her you owe the&s;e valuable pic|tures.</P>
<P>E&s;tranged from all &s;ociety, the Queen of Scots gave her&s;elf up to the blacke&s;t de&s;pair, &s;he had, alas! no hope to &s;often her captivity, no bo&s;om to receive her tears; with Norfolk died all pro&s;pect of relea&s;e, and at the &s;ame time all de&s;ire of it; what was the univer&s;e to her without he embelli&s;hed it? Would it not have aug|mented her affliction to have enjoyed
<PB N="78" REF="83">
a &s;overeignty &s;he dur&s;t never hope to &s;hare with him?</P>
<P>Elizabeth, who&s;e fears were always awake from this moment, cut her daily off from &s;ome comfort or convenience; fre|quently changed her keepers and pri&s;on; and by her &s;everity, taught the captive Queen that hatred may be &s;tronger even than love.</P>
<P>Lady Scroope &s;urvived her brother but a twelvemonth, and left no inheritor of her virtues. She recommended you both in the mo&s;t fervent manner to her Lord, who &s;olemnly &s;wore to make a provi&s;ion for you &s;uitable to his fortune, though not your birth.</P>
<P>Some years pa&s;t away, when Lord Scroope, who&s;e grief was at an end, find|ing him&s;elf tired of the inactivity of a country life, accepted &s;ome overtures the Queen made to recall him. He left to me the charge of St. Vincent's Abbey; which he has not inhabited &s;ince.</P>
<P>Hurried on by other events, I have hi|therto neglected to mention the return of
<PB N="79" REF="84">
my brother Anthony, in three years after I brought you here. He fixed his re&s;idence in the hermit's cell, devoting his time to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, and the care of ex|horting the poor, except at tho&s;e hours you have &s;een him in; for his life and mine have been uniform.</P>
<P>I have only two circum&s;tances more to mention; one of which is more afflicting to me, than I once believed, aught re&s;pect|ing money, could ever be. Lord Scroope, who has been abroad &s;ome years in a pub|lic character, has become the object of the crafty Burleigh's hatred, or &s;u&s;picion, and is now confined; while his e&s;tates and wealth are &s;eized by the Queen, who knows &s;o well the value of money, that it is too probable my Lord will never be able to fulfil the promi&s;e made to his wife in your favor.</P>
<P>The other is, that during &s;everal pa&s;t years, I have not been able to hold any intelligence with the Queen of Scotland, who &s;ent me &s;ome letters during the fir&s;t years of her impri&s;onment, which, with tho&s;e &s;he wrote to the Duke, I have pre|&s;erved,
<PB N="80" REF="85">
with various other te&s;timonials of your birth. Time may enable her yet to give you the &s;plendor to which you were born; for Elizabeth is now &s;tricken in years, and Mary more worn by &s;orrow than age. Wait, then my dear children, with patience, when I am in my grave, the de&s;tination of providence, and never claim your parent till &s;he plea&s;es to acknow|ledge you. No virtue is more accepta|ble to God than patience. To be&s;tow happine&s;s, is only in his power; to de|&s;erve it, ever in our own. Oh! if my prayers are heard! if my wi&s;hes a&s;cend to the throne of the Mo&s;t High, he will lead you through this world in peace; he will unite you again to my bo&s;om in a better!"</P>
<P>Here our generous protectre&s;s, our more than mother, ended, cla&s;ping us to her heart with an ardor that evinced the &s;incerity of her words.</P>
<P>But what new ideas; what amazing feelings did her narration give birth to? The impul&s;es of nature taught us to trea|&s;ure every word &s;he uttered; for what in
<PB N="81" REF="86">
the hi&s;tory of our parents could be indif|ferent? Never did our &s;olitude appear &s;o amiable&mdash;"the Court of Elizabeth!"&mdash; Oh my lamented father, could the &s;ole in|flictor of all thy evils, ever, ever attach thy children! Could &s;he who oppre&s;&s;ed her equal, and a Queen, innocent at lea&s;t in all that re&s;pected her, only becau&s;e &s;he was in her power, be capable of alluring two hearts, untainted by that courtly po|litene&s;s, which &s;anctifies the errors of a &s;overeign, and terms her very vices noble weakne&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>But then, to learn I had a mother yet alive; to believe I might one day be re|ceived to her arms, only endeared by misfortune; full of this melting, this heart expanding idea, I would have &s;ought her pri&s;on; I would have been the companion of it: happy, if all my cares could make her forget for one moment, the rigour of her fortune; or call to her remembrance, amid&s;t all her complaints, again&s;t the inju&s;tice of the world, that it &s;till contained two beings
<PB N="82" REF="87">
who were willing to return for her the life &s;he gave.</P>
<P>My duty to Mrs. Marlow alone di|vided my heart: &s;hould I de&s;ert her, who had neglected every thing for us? What! are the ties of nature to cancel, in one moment, tho&s;e of inclination, gratitude, and e&s;teem? Oh, no! I owed, it is true, my being to another; but &s;he to whom I owed the be&s;t part of that being, the for|mation of my mind, the in&s;tilling tho&s;e &s;entiments which alone make us valuable to our&s;elves and &s;ociety, had a claim be|yond all others, which nothing but death could di&s;&s;olve. That awful moment was drawing nigh; every one that pa&s;&s;ed, &s;tole &s;omething from the mortal part of Mrs. Marlow. Oh thou amiable &s;aint! thou woman after God's own heart! can I re|member the time when thou wert called from us, without floods of unavailing tears?

She delivered us a ca&s;ket, which con|tained the papers &s;he mentioned, and di|vers atte&s;tations, &s;igned by her&s;elf, and the late Lady Scroope, and filled with all the ornaments of her youth. Then, after recommending us tenderly to Father An|thony, &s;he joined in prayer with him, and all her little family; and in the mid&s;t, expired.</P>
<P>Oh, Madam, how &s;trange, how terrible to me, was that moment! I &s;aw Death fir&s;t &s;eize on one dearer than my&s;elf: the man&s;ion in which we lived, now became a &s;olitude indeed&mdash;a &s;ilence&mdash;how &s;o|lemn! prevailed. In the fir&s;t flow of a rational grief, how va&s;t a vacuum is left in the heart! to hear no longer the voice which led us through life: to &s;ee the eyes, whence ours drew fortitude, clo&s;e, never more to open: the whole frame a&s;&s;ume that awful pallidne&s;s, every moment in|crea&s;es, and which brings &s;o melancholy a memento to the brea&s;t! The&s;e touching ideas cannot always ari&s;e; &s;ome lo&s;&s;es de|&s;troy the power of reflection and complaint;

carried away by the bitterne&s;s of de&s;pair, we are only &s;en&s;ible of an agony beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To attempt interring the du&s;t of Mrs. Marlow in the chapel, mu&s;t have awaken|ed the &s;u&s;picions of the Queen's officers. The &s;ecret of our retirement was in the brea&s;t of only three dome&s;ticks, and it was highly nece&s;&s;ary to keep it concealed. On this account, a grave was made for her in Father Anthony's cell, whither we conveyed her, wrapt in white, and crowned with the fading produce of this world, in imitation of that ever-blooming wreath promi&s;ed hereafter to all, who per|&s;evere in virtue.</P>
<P>Grief makes the mo&s;t violent impre&s;|&s;ion in youth; but, happily, it is the mo&s;t tran&s;ient: a little time abated the &s;harp|ne&s;s of ours; neverthele&s;s, our &s;olitude being deprived of its ornament, appeared uniform, melancholy, and di&s;gu&s;ting. We gradually lo&s;t our a&s;&s;iduity in our works, when we no longer promi&s;ed our&s;elves the great reward of her prai&s;e. Father Anthony, who was never a favorite with us,
<PB N="85" REF="90">
became every day more unplea&s;ant. Mrs. Marlow always pre&s;erved a &s;way over him, which &s;oftened the &s;everity of his manners: that being now at an end, and his temper &s;till more hurt by his affliction for her lo&s;s, he appeared a gloomy tyrant; and the ad|ditional carefulne&s;s with which he ob|&s;erved us, laid an odious re&s;traint on all our expre&s;&s;ions, and made our meals wear an air of &s;ullenne&s;s each party was uncon|&s;cious of cau&s;ing.</P>
<P>Obliged to hide in our own hearts all the little follies and wi&s;hes we had been u&s;ed to reveal without fear, we conver&s;ed with the Father only upon moral and indif|ferent topics; thus every day was the &s;ame, and each of cour&s;e more tedious, when Ellinor &s;ugge&s;ted a &s;cheme which gave us &s;ome amu&s;ement. This was to explore the pa&s;&s;age leading to the ruins, where we might at lea&s;t breathe the fre&s;h air, and, for one hour, have the plea&s;ure of a little novelty. I readily came into the propo&s;al, having had a curio&s;ity to emerge from the moment I heard that pa&s;&s;age fir&s;t mentioned. It was the full height of &s;um|mer,
<PB N="86" REF="91">
and we pitched upon a long afternoon, when we had no fear of being &s;ought for.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age was narrower, clo&s;er, and damper than the others, but very &s;hort. We took a torch that we might find the way of opening it. When we drew near the mouth, I ob&s;erved &s;ome little holes, made doubtle&s;s to give the concealed per&s;on an advantage. I made Ellinor keep back while I examined the place, but &s;aw nothing, however, to awaken any appre|hen&s;ion; a long avenue of broken arches, intermingled with brambles and wild wall-flowers, in the paths of which the gra&s;s grew very high, was all I could di&s;|cern &mdash;nothing could more fully prove the unfrequentedne&s;s of the &s;pot. We therefore examined the fa&s;tening immedi|ately, and found it a &s;mall &s;quare door with two hinges on the top, and fa&s;tened acro&s;s the bottom by a large bar of iron laid on &s;trong hooks. I was unable to open it alone; Ellinor therefore extin|gui&s;hed the light to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; but with all our curio&s;ity and courage, the &s;ight of the pile of ruins threw us into an univer&s;al
<PB N="87" REF="92">
trepidation. On turning round, to &s;ee how the entrance was hid, we perceived a high, rai&s;ed tomb, at each corner of which &s;tood a gigantic &s;tatue of a man in armour, as if to guard it, two of whom were now headle&s;s. Some famous knight, as appeared by his numerous en|&s;igns, lay on the tomb.

Nothing could be better contrived than this entrance, for how|ever rude the &s;culpture, the ornamental parts took the eye from the body of the tomb. The little door, which dropt after us, was one &s;tone made thin, and lined with wood, and &s;o neatly fitted, that even when unfa&s;tened, it was not to be di&s;cerned. For a long way beyond, the pro&s;pect was wild and awful to exce&s;s; &s;ometimes va&s;t heaps of &s;tones were fallen from the building, among which, trees and bu&s;hes had &s;prung up, and half in|volved the dropping pillars.

&s;eemed to &s;way about with every bla&s;t, and from who&s;e mouldering top hung clu&s;ters and &s;pires of ivy. In other parts, ruined cloi&s;ters yet lent a refuge from the wea|ther, and &s;ullenly &s;hut out the day; while long echoes wandered through the whole at the touch of the lighte&s;t foot; the in|tricacies of the wood beyond, added to the magnificence of art the variety of nature.

<P>One day, in calling my &s;i&s;ter, I di&s;co|vered in the hollow of the wood and building, a very fine echo; delighted with this, I began &s;inging; the notes dying di&s;tinctly away, formed a melancloly &s;ym|phony, when I was interrupted by Ellinor, who quitting &s;ome birds that flew tamely to be fed by her hand, ran towards the Rece&s;s with great &s;peed, waving to me to follow her. We had &s;o often alarmed each other without any cau&s;e, that I hardly moved, when a noi&s;e I heard among the trees (which grew extremely thick on that &s;pot) alarmed me. A voice, that &s;unk at once from my ear to my heart, conjured me in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to &s;top. Notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ity I found for flying, my eyes longed to claim acquaintance with the
<PB N="91" REF="96">
features to which that voice belonged, and my head, by an involuntary motion, was turned over my &s;houlder. The gen|tleman had now made a way through the &s;hrubs which impeded his pa&s;&s;age, and I found it impo&s;&s;ible to retreat but by di&s;|covering, a &s;ecret it was highly my intere&s;t to conceal. Perhaps I was not &s;orry to have an excu&s;e to my own heart for a ra&s;h|ne&s;s it was too &s;en&s;ible of. The irre&s;olu|tion of my attitude, which was that of a per&s;on ready every moment to run, made him approach with profound &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and re&s;pect; but finding me attempt to fly, though almo&s;t without knowing it, he in&s;tantly &s;topt.</P>
<P>"By whatever chance, &s;aid he, nature has hid in this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot her faire&s;t productions, permit me, ladies, to derive an advantage from it.

<P>The per&s;on of him who pronounced the&s;e words, made their effect indelible. He appeared &s;omething pa&s;t the bloom of life, but his beauty was rather fixed than faded; of a noble height and per|fect &s;ymmetry, he would have had an air too maje&s;tic, but that the &s;weetne&s;s of his eyes and voice tempered the dignity of his mien. His complexion was of a clear and poli&s;hed brown; his eyes large, dark, and brilliant; his hair gracefully marked the turn of all his features, and his dre&s;s was of a dove-coloured velvet, mingled with white &s;attin and &s;ilver; a crim&s;on &s;a&s;h inwoven with gold; hung from his &s;houlder with a picture; and the order of the garter, as well as a fo|reign one, with which he was inve&s;ted, &s;hewed his rank not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed than his per&s;on.</P>

Fear &s;urmounted every pru|dential con&s;ideration, and I was only go|ing to u&s;e the caution of enquiring who he was, when the &s;ound of voices, not far di&s;tant, put that out of my head. Re|taining, in mine, the hand which had hi|therto held it, I led him through the mo&s;t &s;olitary arches to the foot of the tomb; but our a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;ight of him, bore no compari&s;on with his, when he found this to be our habitation.

With an im|patient gratitude, he fell at my feet to thank me for my anxiety, but in&s;tantly &s;tarting back, he threw me into &s;uch a tre|pidation, that I &s;unk into a &s;eat without power to look behind me, imagining ei|ther that the murderers, or at lea&s;t, Fa|ther Anthony, mu&s;t be at hand; when looking around him, and at me by turns, he exclaimed,</P>

<P>"You are &s;ilent, Madam, cried he, but your eloquent eyes imply a doubt it is my duty to clear.

<P>It was the picture of Elizabeth, given by her&s;elf to Robert Dudley, as the in|&s;cription informed me.</P>

<P>"I will reply to you with candor, Ma|dam, added he, and thus be&s;peak your confidence. The favor of a &s;overeign may ea&s;ily make us great, but many circum&s;tan|ces mu&s;t concur to make us happy; and when you hear &s;ome events of my life, I may promi&s;e my&s;elf your compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="103">Ellinor, having executed her commi&s;|&s;ion, rejoined us at this moment. I will frankly confe&s;s I wi&s;hed her ab&s;ence, and had impo&s;ed a ta&s;k on her I could never have executed. The pre&s;ence of Lord Leice&s;ter had awakened in my mind a thou&s;and hopes and wi&s;hes unknown be|fore. Not recollecting the improbability of his pa&s;&s;ing &s;o many years without form|ing tender attachments, almo&s;t uncon&s;ci|ou&s;ly I a&s;pired to his heart; and my apprehen&s;ion of Ellinor's &s;uperior charms, had made me meanly cheat her of an op|portunity of making a fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion: by &s;ubmitting to my inju&s;tice &s;he rendered me &s;en&s;ible of it in the mo&s;t generous manner, and the care I then took to di&s;|play her merit, induced my Lord to ima|gine I regarded him with indifference. Thus I reaped a double advantage from my return to rectitude.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter informed us, &s;he had &s;een four men examining every part of the ruins; certain Lord Leice&s;ter mu&s;t be hid among them, as one had picked up his hat (which he doubtle&s;s dropt when he
<PB N="99" REF="104">
addre&s;&s;ed me) and &s;wearing never to quit the wood till they had found him, they &s;e|parated to pur&s;ue the &s;earch.</P>
<P>I turned pale at this terrible intelli|gence, which made his departure impo&s;&s;i|ble; but as we every moment expected Father Anthony, who might have a &s;hare in the alarm the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins would occa&s;ion, we agreed to hide my Lord in Mrs. Mar|low's chamber, which had been hitherto de&s;erted, and a place where none but our|&s;elves would &s;eek him.</P>
<P>It was now evening, and as the age and infirmities of our maid rendered her ra|ther an incumbrance than relief, we &s;et before Lord Leice&s;ter a repa&s;t, perhaps more adapted to his health than his ap|petite, but all that our Retreat at that time afforded; and, withdrawing, left him that we might be ready if our guardian &s;hould vi&s;it us.</P>
<P>As I would not have you imagine, how|ever we were indebted to nature, the &s;ur|pri&s;e Lord Leice&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed; &s;prung only from our beauty, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, we dre&s;t to the ta&s;te of Mrs. Marlow, rather

Simplicity is the perfection of dre&s;s, and Ellinor pre&s;ents her&s;elf in that I have de|&s;cribed, more beautiful than when adorned with all the gaudy trappings pride and luxury has invented. She had an arch, a &s;miling eye, which, while it indicated ob&s;ervation, teemed with good nature; a complexion perfectly fair, and delicately heightened by a bloom which came from the heart, as its changeablene&s;s implied; a graceful &s;tature, and a manner which

won almo&s;t every one to love her half as well as I did. But I need not expa|tiate on my Ellen's character; though dormant at pre&s;ent, it will &s;oon demand your compa&s;&s;ion in the harde&s;t trials of life.</P>
<P>Love, Madam, is the parent of art.

<P>The Father, always &s;low and delibe|rate, &s;eemed this day to have gained an addition to tho&s;e qualities; in&s;tead of re|tiring after dinner, as u&s;ual, he began a long di&s;cour&s;e (from a momentary impa|tience I had di&s;covered through &s;ome trifling occa&s;ion) on the &s;ubduing our pa&s;&s;ions, every word of which augmented mine, and the le&s;s we &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of his argument, the more he was inclined to prolixity, till my impatience having ari&s;en

<P>My attachment to her was as great as her own goodne&s;s; I longed, with the ardour of youth, to &s;ignalize my&s;elf in her &s;ervice; nor was it long before an occa&s;ion offered. The Earl of Devon|&s;hire,

To effect this, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf as a gardener, and worked &s;everal days in the hope of &s;eeing Elizabeth, but in vain; for the Queen's orders were &s;o &s;trict, that &s;he was allowed for exerci&s;e only a long gallery with lat|ticed windows, which joined to her apart|ment.

She replied, "had not &s;he ex|pected &s;uch an an&s;wer, &s;he had not ventured &s;uch a que&s;tion; &mdash;what I wi&s;h then, continued the Prince&s;s, is that, when you can find him alone, you will tell that man, I have &s;een, and know him; and &s;ince I cannot doubt his intention is to render me &s;ome &s;ervice, I reque&s;t he will &s;ignify its nature by you; but as he may doubt the &s;incerity of a gentle|man, who&s;e intere&s;t &s;eems &s;o oppo&s;ite to his own, &s;hew him this jewel, he will remember it, and &s;ay I bid you tell him, it was the gift of his father to me &s;ome years ago."</P>

<P>Elizabeth, di&s;gu&s;ted at the free hope he ex|pre&s;t, or perhaps unwilling to remove her&s;elf &s;till farther from the throne by offending her &s;i&s;ter, declined the propo&s;al of the Earl, who neglected no in&s;tance to induce her to change her mind, as he could never hope to find a time &s;o favorable for her e&s;cape: he fancied at la&s;t, I had an intere&s;t in her rejecting him, and when nothing could prevail with her, lavi&s;hed all his re|proaches on me, as the capital ob&s;tacle. I know not to what extremities he might have carried his re&s;entment, had not Lord Arundel, to whom the head gardener had declared his &s;u&s;picion of this man, from having found &s;ome jewels &s;ewed in his garb, cau&s;ed him to be apprehended; but his ill health and infirmities, di&s;abling him from an immediate examination, no|tice was &s;ent to the Court, and the Earl confined with caution. The Prince&s;s alarmed at this accident, which &s;he fore|&s;aw her enemies would con&s;true to her di&s;|advantage, without giving her a chance to
<PB N="112" REF="117">
ju&s;tify her&s;elf, forgot that calmne&s;s, which con&s;tituted in her early years the meri|torious part of her character. I too &s;en|&s;ibly felt her afflictions, not to participate in this; and to prove my &s;ympathy, formed a de&s;ign, which the romantic genero&s;ity Incident to youth alone could ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Intru&s;ted with the charge of the cri|minal, it was very ea&s;y for me, in the dead of night, to &s;et him free; but to render my genero&s;ity complete and en|&s;ure his e&s;cape, I ordered a hor&s;e to be in readine&s;s in the thicket as for my&s;elf, and furni&s;hing him with &s;ome clothes of my own, conducted him to the garden gate, and returned more &s;atisfied with my own conduct than I ever yet had been.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of his e&s;cape &s;ug|ge&s;ted them&s;elves immediately to Lord Arundel on his receiving the informa|tion; he &s;ent for me, as my connivance was evident, and angry at my refu&s;ing even a rea&s;on for it, &s;ave the promi&s;e I had made, he ordered me to be confined, and di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Court with the full particulars of the pri&s;oner's en|largement.
<PB N="113" REF="118">
A &s;hort time, however, abated his re&s;entment; he reproached him&s;elf for a ra&s;hne&s;s as culpable as my own, and &s;ent &s;everal of his &s;ervants to &s;tay the fir&s;t, but not finding him return, he was plea&s;ed at once to forget my ob&s;tinacy, and, by coming to vi&s;it me, &s;hew he pardoned my fault. &mdash;He then told me he had nothing to propo&s;e, that would en&s;ure my &s;afety, but immediate flight; and not doubting that he could appea&s;e the Queen, recommended me to &s;et out immediately for Ireland, to take refuge with his bro|ther-in-law, Sir Patrick Lineric. Over|whelmed with his goodne&s;s, I had no way to atone for my error, but obedience, and prepared for my journey without he|&s;itation; &mdash;the reluctance with which the Earl parted from me, was a cutting re|proach; but heaven did not &s;uffer me to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed: I was met on the road by a party of guards, conducted by the fir&s;t me&s;&s;enger, who, ignorant of the change in Lord Arundel's re&s;olution, imagined I was making my e&s;cape likewi&s;e, and con|jured the officer to &s;eize me: a&s;toni|&s;hed

at a &s;troke &s;o unfore&s;een and unlucky, I delivered up my arms without re&s;i&s;tance, and was conducted to the Tower of Lon|don.</P>
<P>Some days elap&s;ed without my &s;eeing any but my guard, when I was con|ducted before the privy council, and interrogated concerning what I knew of the pri&s;oner and his de&s;igns; but re|fu&s;ing to an&s;wer, I was remanded back to a clo&s;er dungeon and harder fare. This was repeated &s;everal times, in&s;omuch that I was a&s;toni&s;hed at not being tried and &s;entenced by the law; when one day I was agreeably &s;urprized at &s;eeing Lord Arundel enter my pri&s;on. Want of air and proper food had &s;o altered me, that the good man, neglecting his commi&s;&s;ion, wept like an infant on my neck; but re|covering, and remembering he was not &s;ent to con&s;ole me, &mdash;and had witne&s;&s;es at|tending to report our di&s;cour&s;e, he began with conjuring me, by every power he had over me, as a father, a guardian, and a friend, to provide for my own &s;afety by a di&s;covery of all I knew, without which
<PB N="115" REF="120">
my life would be devoted, in &s;pite of his efforts, and the affliction of lo&s;ing the only prop of his age, would infallibly &s;horten his days.</P>
<P>The gentlene&s;s of this addre&s;s, the concern which wrung every venerable feature, pierced my &s;oul; and, although I could not betray the Prince&s;s, I will candidly confe&s;s I lamented my ra&s;h officiou&s;ne&s;s; but as repentance was fruit|le&s;s, I had only to &s;ummon patience to endure an evil I had brought on my&s;elf: neverthele&s;s, to afflict the benefactor, to who&s;e goodne&s;s I owed all, was a trial in|deed. I threw my&s;elf at his feet, I con|jured him only to remember my ob&s;tina|cy, to ca&s;t me from his heart, but never to employ a power I revered, to make me odious and contemptible, &mdash;a&s;&s;uring him, an honourable death was, in my eyes, in|finitely more to be de&s;ired than a life pro|longed by treachery and ingratitude. &mdash; He regarded me with attention, and after &s;eeming to deliberate for a mo|ment, he proceeded to offer me the mo&s;t &s;plendid rewards. I &s;topt him; "oh,
<PB N="116" REF="121">
my Lord! exclaimed I, can you think &s;o meanly of the man before you, as to be|lieve, after re&s;i&s;ting your intreaties, he can poorly be bribed to do ill; how truly un|worthy then were I of the name of your &s;on?"</P>
<P>"What can I &s;ay?" &s;aid he, turning to &s;ome men pre&s;ent, and drawing his hands from mine to cla&s;p them together in an agony of grief; "how &s;eek to cor|rupt a con&s;tancy I admire? Adieu, my dear &s;on, I am unequal to the ta&s;k im|po&s;ed on me. May the God who taught you principles &s;o ju&s;t, ble&s;s and protect you, whatever your fate; my days may &s;till be fewer than yours, and this is, per|haps, an eternal farewell. &mdash;Adieu again, I will never forget you;" &s;aying the&s;e words, he caught hold of &s;ome per&s;ons pre&s;ent, who rather carried than led him out.</P>
<P>I had before this been &s;upported by pride, but the &s;en&s;e of doing wrong, had never mingled with my feelings till now: my own life had hitherto pre&s;ented no|thing to make it particularly valuable;
<PB N="117" REF="122">
but that of Lord Arundell, was a ble&s;&s;|ing to him&s;elf and his country: and what right had I to &s;horten it? I, who&s;e peculiar duty it was to watch over his de|cay, and &s;mooth his pa&s;&s;age to the grave; this remembrance gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible grief.</P>
<P>I found likewi&s;e that the court, from my re&s;olution, imagined the plot of much more con&s;equence than it really was; yet after &s;o many denials I could not declare the whole, without bringing an imputa|tion, more terrible than death, on my memory: I therefore called together every reflection that could fortify my mind, and waited my fate with compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>A very few days after this interview put an end to the life of a Queen, who&s;e cruelty ca&s;t a blot alike on her &s;ex and re|ligion, and Elizabeth being placed on the throne by the voice of the people, made the opening of my pri&s;on doors one of her fir&s;t cares; &mdash;&s;he did me the honour of &s;ee|ing me in the garments I had worn in my confinement, and gave me her royal word that &s;he could find no greater plea&s;ure in
<PB N="118" REF="123">
her &s;overeignty, than that of rewarding my fidelity.</P>
<P>An allay was prepared to this &s;atis|faction; Lord Arundell expired the night before of the gout in his &s;tomach; but, knowing I might claim my &s;afety from the new Queen, he had left me joint heir with his niece, of his e&s;tates, with only one condition, which was, that of mar|rying her; ordering the covenant &s;hould be fulfilled in two years, and if either party refu&s;ed to comply, his or her &s;hare of the fortune &s;hould go to the other. &mdash; All the advantages I could have reaped, had he left me &s;ole heir of his wealth, would never have recompen&s;ed me for his lo&s;s. This blow le&s;&s;ened the hopes of my life; I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf in the fir&s;t moments of my freedom, to convince this nobly di&s;intere&s;ted friend, that independence could never le&s;&s;en my gratitude, but would rather increa&s;e an attachment to which the malicious could then a&s;&s;ign no motive but the ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>The Queen, in the fir&s;t years of her reign, loaded me with honors, called me
<PB N="119" REF="124">
her knight, nor entered into any amu&s;e|ment in which I was not a party. The ob&s;equious behaviour of my equals, flat|tered a vanity latent in my heart, and per|&s;uaded me they &s;aw deeper into her inten|tions than my&s;elf. I was much younger than Elizabeth, and involved in another engage|ment, yet the world thought &s;he loved me; but being little di&s;po&s;ed to matrimony, and by the Queen's bounty enabled to indulge my&s;elf, I gave up to mi&s;s Lineric the e&s;tates of her uncle, without even &s;eeing her, becau&s;e I would not offend the rela|tion of Lord Arundell, by giving the world rea&s;on to believe I did it from di&s;ta&s;te. This circum&s;tance no &s;ooner reached the ear of the Queen, than it filled her with gladne&s;s vi&s;ible to the whole Court, which confirmed them in the belief I was de&s;tined one day to &s;hare her rank. I had rea&s;on to be convinced, from many circum&s;tances of the Queen's conduct, known but to my&s;elf, that &s;he really had an affection for me, and only waited till &s;ome of the elder nobility, who were my rivals, had given up the pur&s;uit,
<PB N="120" REF="125">
and till my years allowed her to make me her choice, without bringing a cen&s;ure on her prudence.</P>
<P>Attached to Elizabeth rather by gra|titude than affection, I had patience enough to wait her re&s;olution, and enter|tained my&s;elf rather with the gaieties, than the politics of the kingdom. It was at this time the beautiful Mary of Scotland &s;hone forth (fatally for her&s;elf) the rival of Elizabeth, and de&s;troyed that peace which pro&s;perity and admiration had contributed to be&s;tow on our Queen. In the adver&s;ity of her youth, &s;he flattered her&s;elf with &s;upporting a &s;uperiority over her oppre&s;&s;or by a di&s;creet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but to meet with &s;o powerful a rival in beauty, talents, and empire, when at the &s;ummit of her glory, was a &s;troke as mor|tifying as unexpected: She ever &s;ickened at the name of Mary, and, by extra|vagant prai&s;es, pointed the &s;evere remarks &s;he continually made on her conduct. She maintained with a rigid exactne&s;s the advantages &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the &s;itu|ation
<PB N="121" REF="126">
of her kingdom, over her neighbour, and continually affected to chu&s;e her a hu&s;band from the hand&s;ome and di&s;&s;olute nobles of her Court. Melvil, the Scotch Amba&s;&s;ador, among other pre&s;ents to Eli|zabeth, brought with him a picture of the Queen of Scotland; it was done by a French arti&s;t exqui&s;itely &s;killed; this lit|tle portrait Elizabeth always wore hanging to her brea&s;t: I never beheld it without admiring the fine&s;t imitation art could ex|ecute of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed production of nature. One evening while the Queen was conver&s;ing with me, my eyes, by a kind of habit, were fixed on this orna|ment: &s;he &s;uddenly ro&s;e, and retired in great wrath to her apartment. She &s;hut her&s;elf up three days before the extrava|gance of her re&s;entment permitted her to form any re&s;olution; at la&s;t the Counte&s;s of Somer&s;et came to me with the pic|ture, and an a&s;&s;urance from the Queen, that as &s;he perceived I could never be happy without the original, &s;he &s;hould alter her de&s;igns, and had &s;ent directions
<PB N="122" REF="127">
to the Earl of Bedford to propo&s;e me to Mary.</P>
<P>Thunder-&s;truck at &s;o exce&s;&s;ive and ridi|culous a jealou&s;y, I neglected nothing to &s;atisfy the Queen; I made a thou&s;and pro|te&s;tations of my indifference to the Queen of Scots in vain; Elizabeth's pride was offended, and that was the harde&s;t to ap|pea&s;e of all her pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;&s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my keeping the picture, and haughtily forbad me ever to remember her but as my &s;overeign.</P>
<P>I retired from her pre&s;ence piqued by her haughtine&s;s, which, though a quality adapted to her rank, is di&s;gu&s;ting in her &s;ex. The picture of Mary was yet in my hand&mdash;when I remembered the &s;weet|ne&s;s and affability &s;he was famed for, the infinite &s;uperiority of her charms, and the &s;oftne&s;s of her character, I was grateful to Elizabeth for her anger; &s;ince it broke the ties my gratitude had formed, and left me in hope of a happier fate. &mdash; I repented a me&s;&s;age I had &s;ent off to the Earl of Bedford to forbid his mentioning
<PB N="123" REF="128">
my name, and only wi&s;hed it might ar|rive too late. &mdash;In my union with Eliza|beth I &s;aw I mu&s;t be a cypher, for &s;he was jealous to exce&s;s of her power: with Mary I might &s;hare a kingdom, and, by &s;tudying her humour, render her and my|&s;elf happy. All our wi&s;hes are not, how|ever, to be &s;ucce&s;sful. The Queen of Scots, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that Elizabeth intend|ed to rai&s;e me to the throne of England, believed the propo&s;al a je&s;t, and treated it as &s;uch. The Earl of Bedford gave into this, from a conviction he &s;hould oblige me by it, and thus I found my&s;elf, after having a&s;pired to two Queens, without hopes of either.</P>
<P>From the moment of my being neg|lected by Elizabeth, I had found my&s;elf in the condition of tho&s;e favorites who fall from the pinnacle of greatne&s;s to ob|&s;curity. After &s;eeing my pre&s;ence make a circle, and my apartment a Court, I ap|peared alone, or continued in &s;olitude. Vanity, and not genero&s;ity, had governed me, and of tho&s;e who followed, no one really loved, and all envied me; they re|joiced
<PB N="124" REF="129">
in my di&s;grace, and ridiculed my ambition. What &s;hall I &s;ay, ladies? &s;hall I give fal&s;e motives for my actions, or con|fe&s;s faults my youth may cxcu&s;e? I mu&s;t be &s;incere, whether that &s;incerity intere&s;ts you in my favour or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved at all events to have the plea&s;ure of mortifying my enemies&mdash;I wrote to the Queen, a&s;&s;uring her, the ho|nors &s;he had loaded me with, were incum|brances, &s;ince &s;he had withdrawn her favor, and if my offence (unwitting as it was) exceeded forgivene&s;s, I reque&s;ted to re&s;ign my employments and retire to Kenilworth. This letter I took an opportunity of pre|&s;enting to her in the gardens of Sheen, and, far from pronouncing a &s;evere &s;en|tence, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;hed tears, and tenderly reproached me on the lightne&s;s of my attachment; on which I took the picture of the Queen of Scots, and ca&s;ting it into the Thames, entreated her to bury with it the remembrance of my fault. &mdash;She gave me her hand to ki&s;s, and I had the pride of leading her to the Court, re-in&s;tated in her favor.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="130">This di&s;grace taught me a u&s;eful le&s;|&s;on; which was to employ my power but to &s;erve the worthy, the only way to &s;e|cure friends and avoid making enemies. I learnt how to rate ju&s;tly all who &s;ur|rounded me, to de&s;pi&s;e flattery, and by never elevating my&s;elf, put it out of the power of malice or envy in future to hu|miliate me. The Queen was pre&s;&s;ed by the Parliament to marry; &s;he had pro|mi&s;ed to deliberate on the propo&s;al, and my intere&s;t in her heart, made me hope a favorable conclu&s;ion to my &s;uit, when an unfortunate chance overturned all my &s;chemes and hopes, and made me trem|ble whenever the Queen opened her lips to me, le&s;t I &s;hould hear a re&s;o|lution which was &s;o lately my utmo&s;t wi&s;h.</P>

unknown to it before. I was am|bitious of her notice, and envied the courtiers who &s;urrounded her; I yet trem|bled to approach her, and the compli|ment of introduction was delivered by me with a low voice and timid air; the cold dignity of her manner, and her in&s;tantly turning from me to conver&s;e with Lord Sands, affronted me highly. I examined all I had &s;aid or done, but not finding any thing exceptionable on my part, I condemned her as a flattered girl, vain of accidental advantages even to folly; I retired with the Queen without taking any farther notice of Lady E&s;&s;ex. The Queen gave a ball that evening: I dre&s;t &s;everal hours too &s;oon, and continually fancied the clock &s;tood. Not doubting that I had the power of mortifying Lady E&s;&s;ex, I determined to u&s;e it; even her Lord &s;eemed united in her offence, though I had no complaint to make again&s;t him but that he had married her. In &s;hort, plea&s;|ed or angry, I could think of nothing but her, and though I &s;taid at home till quite

<P>The Queen learning I was there, and plea&s;ed with my attention, which &s;he placed to her own account, &s;ent for me to her clo&s;et; among other que&s;tions &s;he a&s;ked how I liked Lady E&s;&s;ex, and the a&s;perity with which I cen&s;ured her, was far from di&s;plea&s;ing Elizabeth, who had a talent for &s;atire and was fond of all who excelled in it.</P>
<P>We entered the room at the &s;ame mo|ment with the lovely bride, more obvi|ou&s;ly &s;o as more adorned.

I replied, "when I knew whether &s;he had any &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould judge of her wit, but that at pre|&s;ent &s;he was perfectly unintelligible to me." "Why, &s;urely my Lord, cried the Queen, leaning on the arm of her chair, and rai&s;ing her eyes to mine, you know &s;he was Mi&s;s Lineric?" What a fund of intelligence was conveyed in the&s;e few words, and what a revolution did they make in my mind! &mdash;To find I had refu&s;ed, and in refu&s;ing in&s;ulted the wo|man on whom my happine&s;s mu&s;t depend, or, rather, from who&s;e re&s;entment my mi&s;ery was begun. &mdash;Pride, anger, and ambition vani&s;hed; my heart overflowing with chagrin and love, applauded her ju&s;t di&s;dain, and owned &s;he could never de|&s;pi&s;e me for my &s;tupidity half &s;o much as

<P>Several years pa&s;t away in a variety of &s;cenes without my &s;eeing Lady E&s;&s;ex, when the early death of her Lord left her at liberty to fix her re&s;idence in England.

I ea&s;ily di&s;cerned her aim was a marriage with me, which from every rea&s;on, and more e&s;|pecially the promi&s;e I had made to the Queen, I wi&s;hed to avoid.

<P>Lord Leice&s;ter, alarmed, united with the terrified Ellinor to recover me; when fearing my full eyes would betray my heart, I urged indi&s;po&s;ition, and be&s;ought his excu&s;e for retiring to my chamber.

<P>This plan was of it&s;elf &s;o innocent, and well contrived, that I re&s;olved to au|thori&s;e it, and Le Val, &s;atisfied with his di&s;covery, retired. He had indeed re|lieved his mind, but what a weight had he left on mine! The bare idea had filled me with a thou&s;and horrors. Every thing confirms us in either love or hatred. &mdash;The &s;ilence of my friends when my marriage was di&s;covered; her tears, her altered per&s;on, that remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in writing, for which I had in my own heart cen&s;ured the Queen&mdash;all, in &s;hort, I &s;o lately thought ine&s;timable proofs of her love, now ro&s;e as terrible pre&s;umptions of her guilt; and yet, when I &s;aw her enter my chamber pre&s;ently after, and tenderly ac|cu&s;e me for &s;o long an ab&s;ence, I could have received a mortal draught from her hand with le&s;s pain than it co&s;t me to &s;u&s;|pect her.</P>
<P>The day was clo&s;ing, and the table covered when I entered the Hall, occa&s;i|oned by my long &s;leep. Le Val began the
<PB N="146" REF="151">
premeditated uproar, and Lady Leice&s;ter with her brother flew towards the door, whence the attendants had before depart|ed, eager to increa&s;e the bu&s;tle. The faithful &s;ewer, on whom I kept an eye, exchanged the di&s;hes in the manner agreed, and we returned to the table. I ob&s;erved to my Lady that &s;he trembled violently which &s;he naturally enough attributed to the alarm. A&s;&s;uring me &s;he had her&s;e prepared the carp, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my do|ing honor to it, and urging her to bea me company, I accepted her invitation. An involuntary emotion made me every moment ready to prevent her ta&s;ting the exchanged di&s;h; but the plea&s;ure with which the infamous Lineric &s;eemed to &s;ee me &s;wallow the &s;uppo&s;ed death, kept me from &s;peaking. Scarce was the table cleared, when Lady Leice&s;ter &s;unk back in &s;trong convul&s;ions, Con&s;cience made Lineric exclaim, "poi&s;on, poi&s;on!" Every common antidote was admini&s;tered in vain; &s;he was borne to her chamber in an hopele&s;s &s;tate, and I retired to mine to meditate alone. This terrible conviction
<PB N="147" REF="152">
of the unhappy fate prepared for me on my return from an exile &s;he alone had oc|ca&s;ioned, converted my love into horror and aver&s;ion, She raved dreadfully at in|tervals, and per&s;i&s;ting to the la&s;t I had poi|&s;oned her, expired early in the morning. The blackne&s;s of the &s;oul diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the body, and the proof of her infi|delity was too obvious in her per&s;on.</P>
<P>Whether Lineric's con&s;titution was le&s;s liable to infection, or that he had ta&s;ted the carp more &s;paringly, it was not till &s;he expired that he found him&s;elf af|fected; but the do&s;e was too deadly for him to e&s;cape. Convinced by his &s;i&s;ter's exam|ple, that there was no effectual antidote, he &s;ummoned all his Iri&s;h dome&s;tics into his chamber. The faithful Le Val cho&s;e that moment to enter mine, and inform me of the con&s;ultation, which he in&s;i&s;ted would produce &s;ome fatal event, if I did not con&s;ent that moment to mount hor&s;es which were ready, and attended by him and Williams &s;et out for London; this &s;tep would give me the advantage of fir&s;t re|pre&s;enting the fact, while it &s;ecured my

<P>This advice had its due weight with me, and quitting the Ca&s;tle by &s;tealth, I rode off with Le Val and Williams from my own &s;ervants as the wor&s;t of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and from my home as my grave. It was now day-break, and we had not pro|ceeded, many miles, when, from the top of a hill, we perceived a party apparently pur&s;uing; having the fleeter hor&s;es, we kept the advantage for near twenty miles, when, by taking &s;ome &s;horter road un|known to us, we &s;aw them very near. St. Vincent's Abbey appeared at the &s;ame moment in &s;ight, which Le Val conjured me to &s;eek, giving him my cloak to mi&s;|lead the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. We had no time for deliberation; I &s;truck into the wood, where, finding my hor&s;e an incumbrance, I left him to his fate, and was endeavour|ing to make my way through the bu&s;hes, without any certainty of being right,

<P>Lord Leice&s;ter thus concluded his &s;to|ry; but oh! how much of my life had evaporated during the relation!

As the only acknowledgment for his no|ble frankne&s;s, I in turn related the little tale already repeated, of our melancholy birth, and undecided fate. Tears, com|po&s;ed of every melting &s;en&s;ation, &s;eemed to fall from my eyes on his heart. Tho&s;e fine eyes were teeming with &s;ome generous con&s;olation, when a &s;udden noi&s;e obliged us to &s;eparate. Hardly could he regain the chamber, hallowed as Mrs. Marlow's, ere Father Anthony joined us: the na|tural au&s;terity of his air heightened by &s;ome pre&s;ent chagrin. He threw him&s;elf into a chair, and pre&s;erved a long &s;ilence; which, fear of his having pene|trated into our my&s;tery, prevented my

breaking. Confu&s;ed beyond de&s;cription, a thou&s;and colours cha&s;ed each other from my cheek; nor had I power to rai&s;e my eyes to my &s;i&s;ter, who, accu&s;tomed equally to love and honor me, &s;eemed, in hold|ing my hand, to have gained a &s;ufficient protection.</P>

He was proceeding, when the cough of Father Anthony &s;tartled us. Scarce had Ellinor time to lead my Lord out at one door, ere he entered at another to vi&s;it Alice, who had &s;unk under the fatigue and grief attending the lo&s;s of her mi&s;|tre&s;s.

expre&s;s the various emotions which ran through my frame, when I perceived it was the picture of Elizabeth, which the Earl had, in retiring, &s;omehow or other dropt! In&s;tead of obeying, I &s;natched it up, and attempted to hide it in my bo|&s;om; when, with a &s;trong arm, the Fa|ther wre&s;ted it from me, and read in my features half the my&s;tery: the name en|graved on it, the date, all put him out of doubt as to the owner, and nothing re|mained but to learn how I had come by it. Without the fine&s;&s;es of my &s;ex on the occa&s;ion, as &s;oon as my terrors and tears permitted, I related the who&s;e adventure incoherently. With his cu&s;tomary &s;tern|ne&s;s, he overwhelmed me with reproaches. "Ra&s;h girl, cried, he, could no human prudence &s;ave thee?

<P>"Fir&s;t, may I peri&s;h on the block where my father ended his days! cried I, in a tran&s;port of love and grief: let me, oh God, rather be a martyr to the &s;ins of man|kind, than &s;ubmit to partake them! What! be more cruel than the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, from whom we &s;aved him? Pardon me, Father, cried I, reccovering my&s;elf; but you know not the &s;tory or the heart of Lord Leice&s;ter, who, far from betraying us, is anxious to become our guardian and protector."</P>
<P>"Such a guardian as the wolf is to the lamb, retorted he acrimoniou&s;ly&mdash;who, oh, who would willingly have the ma|nagement of youth!

<P>Nothing is more dangerous than, to judge a generous and youthful mind har&s;h|ly: it then is too ea&s;ily acquitted to it&s;elf, and ri&s;es again&s;t &s;u&s;picions it is uncon&s;ci|ous of de&s;erving.

<P>A week after my marriage, Lord Lei|ce&s;ter departed for Court, promi&s;ing. &s;oon to return, and conduct me to Kenilworth, where he had previou&s;ly re&s;olved I &s;hould re&s;ide with Ellinor.

In &s;pite of the proof I had received, of a matchle&s;s affection, I could not per&s;uade my &s;elf Lord Leice&s;ter would ever return.

Where could &s;he hope for ju&s;|tice, when the Sovereign who &s;wears to protect, mu&s;t find it her intere&s;t to|condemn her?

<P>My doubts vani&s;hed with the&s;e proofs of his attention. I had only now to con|tend with the involuntary hatred I had conceived for the Rece&s;s. I wandered through every apartment, without finding; re&s;t in any: my impa&s;&s;ioned fancy fol|lowed my love into the court, and the &s;ilence and con&s;inement I lived in, be|came more and more odious, I beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment the compo&s;ure of my &s;i&s;ter, and envied her a tranquillity I would
<PB N="168" REF="173">
not have regained, by being unmarried, if 1 could.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the happy hour arrived when I was to quit my retirement. Lord Lei|ce&s;ter had projected the mode of my departure ere he left me. Le Val and his valet were the only per&s;ons in the &s;ecret. To all others, we pa&s;&s;ed for young women educated in a Convent, who, not finding a call to the mona&s;tic life, came with the con&s;ent of our friends, to embelli&s;h the retirement of Lord Lei|ce&s;ter by our mu&s;ical talents. This tale we were well able to &s;upport, for my voice was a very fine one, and the &s;kill and ta&s;te of Mrs. Marlow, added to the tuition of a ma&s;ter, had taught me to manage it properly. Ellinor had not the &s;ame advantage, but touched the lute with a delicacy &s;o exqui&s;ite, that we became nece&s;&s;ary to each other; and as I never &s;ung &s;o well without her accompa|niment, &s;he had been &s;o accu&s;tomed to adapt it to my voice, that &s;omething &s;eemed wanting to either, when the other was &s;ilent. The pa&s;&s;ion Lord Leice&s;ter had
<PB N="169" REF="174">
for mu&s;ic, in which he was a proficient, gave the &s;tronge&s;t probability to the whole. He had paid a hand&s;ome &s;um to accompli&s;h the two daughters of his &s;tew|ard in that &s;cience, and the young wo|men were taught to expect an addition to their number. The time Le Val remain|ed in the Rece&s;s, preparing every thing for our departure, was long enough for him to &s;eem employed in fetching us from abroad. Lord Leice&s;ter came &s;e|veral times to direct all, and to &s;up|port and cheer us with accounts of the care he had taken to render the apart|ments de&s;tined to us, commodious and agreeable.</P>
<P>The Rece&s;s, till now, &s;o calm, &s;o tire|&s;omely tranquil, became at once full of confu&s;ion and hurry; the family pictures were taken from their frames, and conveyed through Father Anthony's cell, gradually to Kenilworth.</P>
<P>By what &s;trange caprice is it, every|thing &s;eems dear to us the moment we know we mu&s;t lo&s;e it? Involuntary tears filled my eyes when the hour of my de|parture
<PB N="170" REF="175">
arrived. As much a &s;tranger to the world as if ju&s;t born into it, how could I promi&s;e to my&s;elf years as peaceful as I had experienced in the Rece&s;s? Long habit has the art of giving charms to places; or, rather, it is the people who inhabit them. It &s;eemed to me, as if in quitting the &s;pot where the du&s;t of Mrs, Marlow was interred, I quitted likewi&s;e her idea: every &s;pot I looked on was marked by &s;ome noble &s;entiment, or ten|der emotion of that dear lady: but I was unju&s;t to my&s;elf, for I have carried in my heart, through, every &s;cene of life, her re&s;pectable image, and nothing but death can efface it.</P>
<P>To part with tho&s;e we love, is the mo&s;t painful &s;tretch of humanity; but what can make it painful to part with tho&s;e we do not love? Separation, like death, &s;eems to era&s;e all the individual ever did to di&s;plea&s;e us, and leaves no remembrance but of his obliging actions. We lo&s;t but little in Father Anthony; but could he forget what he mu&s;t lo&s;e in us? His
<PB N="171" REF="176">
declining years, and ill health, required the tendere&s;t attention; and &s;urely, the care he had &s;hewn in educating us, gave him a ju&s;t claim to ours. My feelings, in this were &s;uperior to my &s;i&s;ter's, for he had been the means of my happi|ne&s;s. I joined my intreaties to tho&s;e of the generous Lord Leice&s;ter, to prevail on him to re&s;ide in a retirement at Kenil|worth: but although he &s;eemed deeply affected at parting with us, he was inflex|ibly bent on ending his days where tho&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter ended. James &s;till remained to attend on him, and Alice was carried very ill to the carriage which conveyed us away.</P>
<P>We took nothing but the ornaments from the Rece&s;s, leaving the furniture ready to accommodate any future unfortu|nates, whom the Father &s;hould think worthy &s;uch a relief.</P>
<P>It was in the du&s;k of the evening we arrived at Kenilworth ca&s;tle: the &s;teward's wife received us with her daughters. Uncon&s;cious of our &s;uperiority, they treated us as young people, Who &s;ought,
<PB N="172" REF="177">
from the genero&s;ity of their ma&s;ter, a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Although I had agreed to confirm this &s;tory, I felt my&s;elf &s;hocked at the freedom they u&s;ed from it. I could have fallen to them, but was af|fronted at their ri&s;ing to me: A little time however reconciled me. "It is Lord Leice&s;ter's intere&s;t, and &s;hall be my plea|&s;ure," was always my argument with my|&s;elf. Mrs. Hart, for that was the name of this dome&s;tick, expatiated on her Lord's per&s;on, character, and magnificence; &s;he officiou&s;ly pointed out the rich ornaments of the gallery and apartments, and looked round to us every moment with the imper|tinent expectation of &s;eeing us filled with the low awe and &s;urprize of people unac|cu&s;tomed to grandeur. The indifference with which we regarded every thing, was not a le&s;s affront to her con&s;equence: &s;he &s;hrunk before it, and pa&s;&s;ed the re|mainder of the evening in a cold and haughty &s;ilence. Her daughters, not more amiable than her&s;elf, gloomily regarded our dre&s;&s;es, and by whi&s;pering, excluded us from joining in the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="178">Such was my introduction into the family it was my right to govern. My heart &s;unk within me; I believed my|&s;elf already fallen to a &s;ervant, and neg|lected by Lord Leice&s;ter. Unu&s;ed to the circum&s;pection nece&s;&s;ary, where &s;e|crecy is de&s;ired, I demanded to be wel|comed in his arms. I &s;urveyed the eyes of my Ellinor, fearful they might re|proach me for having innocently degrad|ed the daughter of the Queen of Scots; but that dear girl, too delicate to add to my unea&s;ine&s;s, pre&s;erved, apparently, her gaiety, and &s;weetly accommodated her&s;elf to the people with whom fortune had mingled her.</P>
<P>The alledging fatigue and indi&s;po&s;ition, obliged them to conduct us to the apart|ment allotted us. I &s;hould perhaps have wondered at its richne&s;s, but that I &s;aw &s;carce any inferior. I was no &s;ooner left in it with Ellinor, than I gave free &s;cope to the tears I had &s;carce been able before to &s;uppre&s;s. My face was hid in her bo|&s;om, when the voice of Lord Leice&s;ter recalled me to my&s;elf. I dried my eyes,
<PB N="174" REF="179">
unwilling to reproach him even by a tear: he entered through a private door, to change the cau&s;e of my grief to joy; for in his pre|&s;ence I hardly ever knewn any other emo|tion; and the generous anxiety with which he entreated our pardon for the reception di&s;cretion had obliged him to order us, had &s;omething in it &s;o graceful, &s;o ardent, and tender, that all the pride of my heart &s;ub|&s;ided at once, and left it full of gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>We wi&s;hed my &s;i&s;ter a good night, and then pa&s;&s;ing through a dark pa&s;&s;age, the whole length of the grand gallery, came into Lord Leice&s;ter's apartments, to which every place I ever &s;aw was mean.

<P>THE communication between our apartments was a profound &s;ecret to all the &s;ervants but Le Val and Williams, my Lord's valet; in who&s;e fidelity, after the late trial, he had the mo&s;t perfect con|fidence. We were, to keep up the farce, pre&s;ented to Lord Leice&s;ter the next day, who &s;oon, by his growing di&s;tinction, taught Mrs Hart and her daughters to ob&s;erve a kind of deference in their be|haviour to us. He ordered them to at|tend
<PB N="177" REF="182">
us round the gardens and park, and not to fail &s;hewing us whatever was worth ob&s;ervation; and through what a beauti|ful variety did they lead us! a world in miniature! A magnificent lake pre&s;ented it&s;elf, in who&s;e clear bo&s;om the trees were reflected, and round which the &s;heep and deer grazed on rich pa&s;ture: &s;wans and water-fowls innumerable played on its &s;urface, and an aight in the centre was made highly picture&s;que by &s;everal half-&s;een cottages, and emblems of agri|culture. The late Lady Leice&s;ter needed not to have made a merit of re&s;iding within the&s;e walls, &s;ince nature and art could furni&s;h nothing lovely that was not enclo&s;ed here. Several gilded boats, and little ve&s;&s;els, danced on the bo&s;om of the lake, and added, by the various &s;tream|ers which played upon the &s;urface, to the gaiety and richne&s;s of the pro&s;pect. When we turned the other way, the Go|thic towers, &s;welling ba&s;tions, gigantic &s;tatues, and maje&s;tic &s;weep of the build|ing, made, that an object &s;carce le&s;s wor|thy of admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="183">All our allotted employment was to &s;ing to Lord Leice&s;ter while at dinner; but as he frequently entertained the neigh|bouring Nobles and Gentlemen, a cur|tain of mu&s;lin was drawn over the bal|cony to &s;creen us from ob&s;ervation. In the evening we &s;ometimes fi&s;hed on the lake; or Lord Leice&s;ter, to indulge in our company, joined in the concert we formed: every day brought with it &s;ome amu&s;ement, and the re&s;traint we lived under, kept up, even in matrimony, all that delicacy, and &s;pirit of affection, which is, by ca&s;e of mind, too apt to decay. At la&s;t, painful nece&s;&s;ity obliged Lord Leice&s;ter to return to Court: he, however, would not leave me with more than one equal in the family, therefore di|rected that I &s;hould pre&s;ide one month, and my &s;i&s;ter the next; by this method, rendering it hard for them to fix on his favorite. We likewi&s;e, with the &s;teward's daughters, wore one kind of habit, and bu&s;ied our&s;elves in the working rich, ta|pe&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="184">But my own happine&s;s could not era&s;e from my mind the oppo&s;ite fate of the unhappy Queen who gave us birth. She was then confined at a place not far di&s;tant from Kenilworth. I had already tried all my intere&s;t with Lord Leice&s;ter in her favour, without &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;o ju&s;t was his no|ble inflexibility, that at the moment my heart was pierced by it, my rea&s;on ad|mired it. "Another man, would he &s;ay, in attempting the relea&s;e of the ill-fated Mary, would only forfeit his obedience, and endanger his life; and were tho&s;e all, perhaps I &s;hould not be able to refu&s;e my Matilda. But remember, my love, to the&s;e I mu&s;t add, the blacke&s;t treachery and ingratitude: it would be, viper like, &s;tinging to death the generous heart that warmed me. Never employ the voice of virtue to charm me to vice; for what &s;eems a duty in you, would be the wor&s;t of crimes in me; and what confi|dence could my wife have in my honor, if I was capable of betraying a partial Sovereign?"</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="185">I then would urge, my only wi&s;h was to re&s;tore my mother's liberty, which no|thing but an unparalleled breach of con|fidence could have taken from her for eighteen years; ob&s;erving, her crown had been lined with thorns too keen for her to de&s;ire to wear it again.</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear Matilda! he would cry, how ignorant are you of the&s;e terri|ble emotions, jealou&s;y and revenge! per|mit me to know your mother's character better than your&s;elf. She had too much pride and plea&s;ure in reigning, to &s;ubmit tamely to this impri&s;onment; or even &s;uppo&s;ing, tired of the evils always in|&s;eparable from a Crown, &s;he could ma&s;|ter her ju&s;t re&s;entment, and &s;eeking an a&s;ylum with her children, a&s;k only to die in peace, her relations would not &s;uffer it. The ambition of the Gui&s;es is become a proverb; they would make u&s;e of her name and wrongs to &s;hake the throne of Elizabeth; and in&s;tead of guarding the Queen, to whom I owed a perfect duty, I &s;hould have have the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing

a terrible war devour my country, of which I was the cau&s;e. Who knows, my dear Matilda, if amid&s;t the&s;e cala|mities my temper might pre&s;erve its equa|lity? I might remember, with regret, the fatal advice which had mi&s;led me, and you might lament, too late, the &s;a|crificing your own happine&s;s to a fallaci|ous hope of re&s;toring your mother's&mdash; Remember Elizabeth is now declining, the chances of life may bring about all you wi&s;h. &mdash;The compa&s;&s;ion of the people has been kept alive for Mary the&s;e &s;even|teen years; &s;hould we lo&s;e Elizabeth, her very impri&s;onment would turn to her ad|vantage, by keeping her in the mid&s;t of a kingdom to which &s;he is the lawful heir: my &s;uppo&s;ition is not vague, for the ex|ample of Elizabeth her&s;elf proves it very po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>What could I oppo&s;e to rea&s;oning &s;o ju&s;t? I could only recommend the cau&s;e of my dear parent to him who can pull down the mighty and exalt the weak.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="187">Every letter from my Lord was filled with complaints of the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Court, and breathed the very &s;oul of love. &mdash;He often intreated me to tell him I was happy, and when I complied, reproached me, through a tender caprice, for being &s;o without him. &mdash;He required me to enu|merate my hourly employments, and al|though half my time was &s;pent in writing pacquets to him, always complained of the &s;hortne&s;s of my letters. He, indeed, gave me no cau&s;e to retort; for it appeared as if he withdrew from the Court half of his hours to amu&s;e me with all the little humorous incidents it continually fur|ni&s;hed. But even the&s;e had not always the power to effect what he wi&s;hed&mdash;my fate never allowed me one hour of perfect happine&s;s, and an evil aro&s;e in his ab&s;ence which filled me with the mo&s;t terrible ap|prehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>My lovely &s;i&s;ter, who was ever my pride and delight, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a peculiar degree, that amiable gaiety which le&s;&s;ens the di&s;tance of rank. From her fir&s;t in|troduction

at Kenilworth, &s;he had given way to an increa&s;e of &s;pirits, natural from &s;uch a change in our pro&s;pects, little fore|&s;eeing how great a danger might ari&s;e from it. &mdash;Williams had been rai&s;ed by Lord Leice&s;ter to the &s;uperintendancy of the family on his returning to Court. He preferred this man, believing he would, from knowing me his Lady, take care I was treated with due re&s;pect. Williams had been a &s;oldier, and had contracted the autho|ritative air annexed to petty officers, which made him in appearance peculiarly &s;uited to the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him. &mdash;Imu&s;t confe&s;s he was never a &s;avorite with me; nature had been unkind to him, and he had been more unkind to him&s;elf, in not &s;oftening her &s;everity. He was beyond the meri|dian of life, his per&s;on coar&s;ely made, his complexion &s;warthy, and his face much &s;carred; he had be&s;ides a fiercene&s;s of mien which &s;carce bent to Lord Leice&s;ter, who, of all men, eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of in&s;piring as much re&s;pect as affection.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189">This man then, madam, marked out thus by nature, ventured to rai&s;e his eyes to the royal, the beautiful Ellinor&mdash;the &s;prightli|ne&s;s of her manner abated his re&s;pect, and he had the in&s;olence to declare his pa&s;&s;ion; call it honourable, and &s;olicit her return. My &s;i&s;ter had too much under&s;tanding not to feel her own fault, and too much pride to &s;upport his in&s;olent freedom. She left him with ineffable di&s;dain, as not worthy of a reply; and came directly to me&mdash;a pre-&s;entiment of &s;ome evil con&s;equence aro&s;e in my mind at the moment &s;he re|lated the in&s;ult. I re&s;olved to give Lord Leice&s;ter immediate notice of it, that he might take his mea&s;ures accordingly, and in the mean while appeared con&s;tantly with my &s;i&s;ter. But we had to manage a man equally artful and fearle&s;s. He had the con&s;ummate impudence to open my letter, and (finding its &s;ubject) detain it. In the mean time, no advice arriving from Lord Leice&s;ter in an&s;wer to mine, I re|mained on the rack of uncertainty; tor|mented by the confidence of a wretch from whom there was no po&s;&s;ible e&s;cape,
<PB N="185" REF="190">
and uncertain even of the nature or extent of our danger. At la&s;t, unable, as the wife of Lord Leice&s;ter, to endure his in&s;ults, and tired of waiting my Lord's re&s;olution, I took an opportunity of repre&s;enting to him the daring boldne&s;s of his conduct, in &s;peaking of love to the &s;i&s;ter of his Lord.</P>
<P>Without any emotion or confu&s;ion, he pleaded guilty to the charge, but artfully endeavoured to exculpate him&s;elf from pre&s;umption, by alledging the rank in which we appeared, and the &s;uppo&s;ition that we were rai&s;ed from ob&s;curity by his Lord; who of cour&s;e could only ennoble me. &mdash;At this in&s;inuation, all the pride of Norfolk and Mary animated my features, yet fortunately recollecting my&s;elf, I replied with moderation; for the villain doubtle&s;s aimed at di&s;cover|ing from whom we really &s;prung, &s;ince our habitation had too probably &s;truck him as containing a con&s;equential &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I forbad him mildly ever to addre&s;s my &s;i&s;ter in that light again, without the ap|probation of my Lord, and attempted to
<PB N="186" REF="191">
retire; when &s;topping me, he bad me re|collect that I talked to one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more authority in the hou&s;e than my&s;elf; that I likewi&s;e knew a &s;ecret of the ut|mo&s;t importance was in his power, and he was determined to make every u&s;e of it, in ca&s;e I did not per&s;uade my &s;i&s;ter to accept him; that I mu&s;t imagine him a fool by referring him to Lord Leice&s;ter; in &s;hort, in&s;tead of a&s;king him, he was re&s;olved to prevent his arriving at the knowledge of the affair, for which rea&s;on he had kept back all my la&s;t letters.</P>
<P>How cruel, madam, was my &s;ituation! alone, without any means of gaining pro|tection from the remainder of my &s;ervants except by declaring a &s;ecret he knew too well I would never reveal; to be thus braved, as well as in&s;ulted, was dreadful! I had yet no way of eluding him, &s;ince the whole family were under his governance, and had I offered to write to Lord Lei|ce&s;ter through, any other channel, I had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear it would fall into his hands.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="192">By this terrible dilemma were the days of the wife of Lord Leice&s;ter embittered in the mid&s;t of affluence; in a &s;pot which might be called the palace of plea&s;ure. &mdash; Thus &s;ituated, I could only counteract treachery and art by the &s;ame. I appeared, after &s;ome reflection, alarmed at his threats, and more willing to forward his views: I exacted from him an oath not to betray my &s;ecret, and on my &s;ide &s;olemnly vowed never to mention his, but to em|ploy my intere&s;t with my &s;i&s;ter in his fa|vor: &mdash;We parted with, mutual di&s;tru&s;t, and an apparent reliance on each others &s;incerity. I performed one part of my promi&s;e by conjuring Ellinor to deceive him with fal&s;e hopes, till Lord Leice&s;ter's return gave me an opportunity of con&s;ult|ing him on the &s;afe&s;t way of di&s;po&s;ing the traitor. It was with much reluctance &s;he con&s;ented, but it would have been a cru|elty unlike her character, to refu&s;e to lighten an evil &s;he was the innocent cau&s;e of. I had then only to find &s;ome means of letting my Lord know it without breaking my word: for once in my life I
<PB N="188" REF="193">
was guilty of duplicity, and, like Philoc|tetes, found my equivocation furni&s;hed a terrible puni&s;hment. I wrote a letter, de|claring the whole to Lord Leice&s;ter, which I kept in my bo&s;om to give to him whenever he &s;hould return; in the mean time I wrote as u&s;ual, and delivered my letters to Williams. The profound &s;ilence I ob&s;erved on this &s;ubject, probably in|&s;pired him with confidence, and although Ellinor refu&s;ed to marry him directly, the point he aimed at, the complai&s;ance with which we both treated him, lulled him at la&s;t into a perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Worn out with hourly complaints of this wretch's impertinence to my &s;i&s;ter, and my fears of the event, I counted, with more than a lover's impatience, the days which mu&s;t elap&s;e before I could &s;ee Lord Leice&s;ter. At length the happy one arrived which brought him, and gave me at once joy and &s;orrow, for who could tell me all its con&s;equences? &mdash;Fo&s;tered in a Court, where he knew but one &s;uperior, Lord Leice&s;ter had added a per&s;onal pride to that which naturally &s;prung
<PB N="189" REF="194">
from the nobility of his birth. The par|tiality of his Sovereign, who di&s;pen&s;ed, through love, with his obedience, had prevented his learning to di&s;gui&s;e his foibles: it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of every one to &s;eem blind to them, by which means he was a favorite without being a hypocrite. Tho&s;e who loved him well enough to allow for this error, and a va|nity I can &s;carce term &s;o, when I re|member the various and numerous ad|vantages he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, might do any thing with him. Impa&s;&s;ioned, generous, good|natured, and noble, where once he was attached, his fortune, honor, nay life, would be ri&s;ked for his friend; but the few who are worthy that name, too often confined his affections. Lord Leice&s;ter was too exalted perhaps to be loved. But I digre&s;s. Pardon me, Madam, when you con&s;ider the cau&s;e. This openne&s;s of heart gave me ju&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend a guilty mind would read the indignant eye of my love, and induced me to &s;up|pre&s;s, for &s;ome days, the intended di&s;clo|&s;ure.
<PB N="190" REF="195">
My precaution &s;ucceeded; Willi|ams knew the character of his Lord, and finding by the freedom and confidence he &s;till te&s;tified, that I was true, began to rely on my word. A journey on which he was accidentally &s;ent, a&s;&s;i&s;ted me highly, in leaving time for my Lord to cool. I laid the letter on his table one evening before I went to bed: Lord Leice&s;ter, who was in another room, came in after me, but had not half read it when he frightened me by his rage and indignation. Had the man been in the hou&s;e I know not how the matter would have ended, but at length my tears and di&s;tre&s;s &s;oftened him; he pa&s;&s;ed two days after in a thoughtful man|ner; I knew not, nor ventured to a&s;k him his re&s;olutions: at the end of that time he regained his temper and compo|&s;ure; he &s;aw the apprehen&s;ions lurking &s;till in my heart, and bade me take cou|rage, for he had found a way to quiet them for ever. I conjured my Lord at lea&s;t to conceal with caution his con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of the affair, which he promi&s;ed,
<PB N="191" REF="196">
and in a great degree performed; but whe|ther it was that knowing he was apprized of it made me fancy his manner would reveal it, I cannot &s;ay; certain it is, I never &s;aw him look at or &s;peak to this man afterwards, without feeling my heart &s;ink within me.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Drake, at this time, formed all the conver&s;ation of England; he had fitted out a large fleet again&s;t the Spani|ards, with which he was ready to &s;ail from Plymouth. Many noblemen, and others, engaged as volunteers, and an in|finite number of people a&s;&s;embled from all parts to view the fleet. Lord Leice&s;|ter, who had always been a &s;trong friend to Sir Francis, &s;et out to take leave of him, and enlarged the train of dome&s;tics he u&s;ually travelled with, for the &s;ake of appearing honorably among numbers who did not know him. So ardent was the de&s;ire of all ranks of people to partake the &s;ight, that not a &s;ingle male &s;ervant willingly &s;taid behind. &mdash;Williams had &s;o great a reli&s;h for the&s;e expeditions, that he a&s;ked my Lord to take him; Le Val's
<PB N="192" REF="197">
&s;ickne&s;s keeping him at Kenilworth, Lord Leice&s;ter complied. A fortnight elap&s;ed before they returned, during which poor old Alice expired: with her died one of the witne&s;&s;es of my marriage: Father An|thony was &s;till in good health, as James, who regularly came once a month, brought word.</P>
<P>Lord Leice&s;ter returned, and returned without Williams. &mdash;Struck to the heart, I had &s;carce &s;trength to enquire what was become of him. My Lord a&s;ked me if I &s;u&s;pected him of having murdered the rogue? "I have only &s;ent him, added he, with a gay air, a long voyage, to teach him to keep a fecret. I knew no other way of getting rid of the ra&s;cal. Sir Francis has undertaken to provide for him too effectually for my dear Matilda to know any further anxiety on his account; in &s;hort, he is &s;hut up in a di&s;tant part of the ve&s;&s;el, the &s;ailors are taught to con&s;ider him as a madman, and have neither time to li&s;ten to his tales, nor &s;en&s;e to under|&s;tand them. &mdash;Thus, my dear love, our fears are entirely over."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198">"Rather begun," I might have replied, for no rhetoric ever after charmed mine to re&s;t. &mdash;A thou&s;and accidents ruin our tranquillity, but it is better to endure their wor&s;t con&s;equences, than return evil for evil. &mdash;However nece&s;&s;ary the &s;tep, the a&s;&s;uming a right to puni&s;h this man, was too culpable in my eyes, not to make me unea&s;y; yet, &s;ince it certainly was to relieve me, Lord Leice&s;ter ex|ecuted the &s;cheme, and becau&s;e nothing could now recall it, I &s;eemed &s;atisfied: Ellinor too per&s;uaded me to be &s;o, from thinking the traitor ju&s;tly puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Before Lord Leice&s;ter returned to Court, I gained his con&s;ent to a pro|ject I had long revolved; this was, to vi&s;it my mother&mdash;to have the joy of being held in her arms, and to be ac|knowledged by her ble&s;&s;ing. &mdash;He was too anxious to indulge all my wi&s;hes, to refu&s;e me in this in&s;tance; but, not being able to further it openly, he only gave me a &s;ufficient &s;um of money to
<PB N="194" REF="199">
bribe her keepers, and directed Le Val to attend us.</P>
<P>This man was as faithful as Williams was the rever&s;e&mdash;if at fir&s;t he re&s;pected me but as the wife of his ma&s;ter, I afterwards gained an a&s;cendant with him from my own conduct, which attached him to me as much as to his Lord, and made the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices &s;eem trifles in his eyes. Eager to oblige and obey, he &s;eemed always ready to fly before he knew whi|ther, and a word of commendation was a &s;ufficient recompence. He was now in the po&s;t of Williams, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have voluntarily embarked with Sir Francis, and the &s;ecret of his fate was confined to Lord Leice&s;ter, my &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Attended by Le Val, we &s;et out for Coventry with beating hearts. We were to vi&s;it, not merely a mother, but an only parent, the &s;ole per&s;on in who&s;e arms we could claim a refuge; though now, alas, far more able vainly to offer her one. We were to &s;ee that Queen who&s;e matchle&s;s beauty was her lea&s;t or|nament;
<PB N="195" REF="200">
to behold her graces withered by eighteen years confinement; to &s;hare in her afflictions, and prove how dearly the children, who had never known her, could love their mother.</P>
<P>But, alas! Madam, we were not per|mitted to realize the&s;e vi&s;ions. &mdash;Le Val found her keepers too hone&s;t, or too fearful to &s;uffer any &s;tranger to conver&s;e with her, and the only privilege money could pur|cha&s;e, was that of &s;eeing the Queen, through a grated window, take her morn|ing walk in a &s;mall garden. Overwhelmed with de&s;pair at this news, we yet em|braced the only indulgence we could gain. &mdash;But, what did we not think that faithle&s;s woman de&s;erved, who thus treated her equal, her relation, her friend! We were conducted to the window, where we were permitted to remain without attend|ants; we &s;aw her come down the walk&mdash; but oh, how changed, and yet how lovely! Damp rooms had weakened her limbs&mdash; her charming arms were thrown round the necks of two maids, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could not move&mdash;a pale

re&s;ignation &s;at on her &s;till beautiful fea|tures: her regal mien could not be eclip&s;ed by a habit of pale purple, nor her fine hair by the veil which, touched her fore|head. &mdash;Her beads and cro&s;s were her only ornaments, but her unaffected pi|ety, and patient &s;ufferance, mingled the Saint with the Queen, and gave her charms beyond humanity. Our emoti|ons were too rapid and &s;trong for de&s;crip|tion; we wept&mdash;we incoherently ex|claimed &mdash;and &s;triking our&s;elves eagerly again&s;t the bars, &s;eemed to hope &s;ome &s;upernatural &s;trength would break them. More afflicted at &s;eeing her thus, than not &s;eeing her at all, I neither could be|hold her for my tears, or re&s;olve to lo&s;e a look by indulging in them. &mdash;She drew near the &s;pot where we &s;tood, when our hands, which we had thru&s;t, in &s;upplication, through the bars, caught her attention. &mdash; She rai&s;ed her fine eyes, with their u&s;ual divine compo&s;ure, to the window&mdash; I would have &s;poke, but my lips denied all utterance. Alas! that ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;that be|nignant glance, was the fir&s;t, the la&s;t, the

only one we ever received from a mo|ther. &mdash;When &s;he withdrew her eyes &s;he carried my very &s;oul with her; all my &s;trength failed at once, and I &s;unk in a &s;woon in my &s;i&s;ter's arms.</P>
<P>Su&s;picions of this nature made it dan|gerous for my Lord, were we frequently to appear there; yet this momentary view had awakened &s;en&s;ations, which, though le&s;s &s;trong than love, were equally la&s;t|ing, and which empoi&s;oned my hours in the bo&s;om of happine&s;s. Bitter tears upon the cheeks of my Leice&s;ter, when with fond endearment he would &s;train me to his bo&s;om, alone &s;poke my thoughts, and I &s;acrificed the le&s;s to the greater duty. &mdash; Ellinor, my dear Ellinor, was, on this theme, my only coun&s;ellor, and we &s;pent days in forming a thou&s;and projects; weeping every evening at di&s;covering their impracticability. The frequent ab|&s;ences of my Lord, left me too much lei&s;ure for this melancholy employment;

yet the ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion made him chu&s;e every opportunity, however &s;hort, to be with me, and 1 trembled le&s;t the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant journeys &s;hould attract the no|tice of Elizabeth, who had been for &s;ome time indi&s;po&s;ed, and was of cour&s;e more &s;en&s;ible to any inattention of her favorite.

<P>To excu&s;e his frequent ab&s;ences to the Queen, my Lord avowed a pa&s;&s;ion for hunt|ing, with which his conduct &s;o little agreed, that he &s;hut him&s;elf up in Kenilworth Ca&s;tle, and &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed beyond his own walls. Con&s;cious this mu&s;t in time be ob&s;erved,

I learnt to ride expertly, and often obliged him to accompany us in mere prudence. To prevent our being too much fatigued, my Lord generally ordered a tent to be pitched, with refre&s;hments, in the fore&s;t; and one morning, finding my&s;elf ill, I quitted the chace almo&s;t directly, and went in &s;earch of our re&s;ting place, guided by a hunt&s;man, as ignorant of it as our|&s;elves. Among the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t in|tricate paths we encountered a gentleman on hor&s;eback, attended by many &s;er|vants; to make way for us, he ordered his &s;ervants to return, and di&s;mounting, bowed, and remained uncovered while we pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Addre&s;&s;ing the man who attended us, he eagerly enquired for my Lord&mdash;the que&s;tion, I knew not why, alarmed me; I turned in&s;tantly to ex|amine his features, and my hor&s;e conti|nuing his pace, &s;truck my head again&s;t an arm of a tree with &s;o much violence, that the reins dropt from my hand, and the &s;tranger was ju&s;t quick enough to catch me.

vein in my arm, which in&s;tantly revived me, and I found my&s;elf in the &s;tranger's arms, who pre&s;&s;ed, with more than com|mon concern, the hand he held. Con|fu&s;ed and perplexed with this accident, I endeavoured in vain to withdraw it, and &s;eeing my hair had fallen in its u&s;ual curls over my neck, looked about for my hat, which yet hung on the bough that &s;truck me. Regardle&s;s of every intreaty, I per|&s;i&s;ted in mounting my hor&s;e, and return|ing in&s;tantly, after I had rendered him every acknowledgment his active polite|ne&s;s merited. He replied with &s;uch peculiar grace and gallantry, as gave me a great de&s;ire to know who he was, but his pur|&s;uing me with his eyes, rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible for &s;ome time: after which the hunt&s;|man informed me he was the nephew of Lord Leice&s;ter, Sir Philip Sidney. His appearance confirmed the agreeable im|pre&s;&s;ion made by his character, and I only regretted being introduced to him by a vexatious accident which &s;eemed too much to po&s;&s;e&s;s his mind.

reflections, although I lay down, it was impo&s;&s;ible to clo&s;e my eyes, when the abrupt entrance of my Lord rou&s;ed me completely. Extreme vexation and dis|order marked his air, and without the lea&s;t enquiry into my hurts, he threw him&s;elf into a chair by me, and la|mented the malice of his fortune. Alarmed beyond mea&s;ure, I &s;tarted from the bed, and kneeling at his feet, conjured him to tell me in what new in&s;tance he had rea&s;on to complain. &mdash;"Matilda, &s;aid he, fixing his eyes on me with a &s;ad intent|ne&s;s, the Queen approaches." &mdash;My heart died within me at the words; his &s;up|porting arms alone &s;aved me from falling to the ground, and his care&s;&s;es from faint|ing.</P>

<P>The amazing hurry produced by this unexpected vi&s;it, had not &s;ub&s;ided, when the cannon proclaimed the approach of Elizabeth. A faint &s;ickne&s;s came over me; my limbs were &s;carce able to &s;up|port my weight, and my eyes hardly &s;erved to guide my &s;teps.

of examining the Queen. She was talking to my Lord, who waited be|hind her chair. Though the features of Elizabeth retained nothing of her mo|ther's &s;weetne&s;s, they were regular; her eyes were remarkably &s;mall, but &s;o clear and quick, they &s;eemed to comprehend every thing with a &s;ingle glance; the de|fect in her &s;hape taking off all real Ma|je&s;ty, &s;he &s;upplied that deficiency by an extreme haughtine&s;s; a &s;evere, &s;atirical &s;mile marked her countenance, and an ab&s;urd gaiety her dre&s;s.

The hall enriched and adorn|ed with &s;ine &s;tatues, tape&s;try, and purple fringed with gold, the high arched Gothick windows, which being thrown, open, gave a beautiful view of the lake, covered with newly ornamented boats, &s;truck the Queen with admiration; while

the immen&s;e crowd of royal attendants, and above all, the profound re&s;pect of many of the nobles, were &s;ights no le&s;s new to me. I turned my eyes round to di&s;cover if among them I could find any to com|pare with Lord Leice&s;ter. Where, ah where! could they &s;elect his equal! &s;uppre&s;t anxiety gave a redoubled glow to his cheek, and his expre&s;&s;ive eyes pierced through the veil which hid us from all others. Dinner removed, the mu&s;ic be|gan. The u&s;ual pieces played, a &s;ilence en&s;ued only interrupted by my voice and the lute of my &s;i&s;ter.

bent over her lute with a beautiful mode&s;ty. The various exclamations of the noble|men might have flattered our vanity, had we not been continually told any thing can make, to courtiers, the wonder of an hour. That fatal moment was &s;ure the critical one of my life; it awakened dan|gerous &s;u&s;picions in the &s;oul of Elizabeth; endle&s;s anxiety in the man in whom my life was bound up, and a pa&s;&s;ion in the heart of another, the cold hand of death alone could extingui&s;h.

<P>The moment I could recollect my&s;elf, I con&s;idered the Queen attentively; &s;he &s;at in the pen&s;ive po&s;ition into which our appearance had thrown her; &s;ometimes &s;urveying us with deep ob&s;ervation, then, with a keener glance, Lord Leice&s;ter.

it&s;elf, and involuntary blu&s;hes co|vered my face, as often as I became the object of her attention. The indifference the Queen expre&s;&s;ed towards the mu&s;ic, obliged every one el&s;e to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, and we &s;oon obtained permi&s;&s;ion to retire. Sydney, who was the me&s;&s;en|ger, overwhelmed us with apologies for the &s;hare he had in our confu&s;ion, although by the command of his &s;overeign. I had perpetual rea&s;on for re&s;enting his officiou&s;ne&s;s, but Sidney was not born to be hated. To exalted genero&s;ity, and the mo&s;t manly courage, he joined ele|gance, refinement, and a temper &s;uperior to events, Yes, gallant Sidney, this no|ble ju&s;tice Matilda owes thy virtues! &mdash;of all her misfortunes, that of becoming thine touched her mo&s;t deeply. &mdash;Our apparent &s;tate of dependence never once induced Sir Philip to forfeit that re&s;pect a man of merit owes to him&s;elf;&mdash;it only united to the politene&s;s univer&s;ally due to the &s;ex, an affecting deference which dig|nified its object.

have dreaded &s;uch a rival&mdash;Midnight alone gave us the freedom of comparing opinions, and I &s;aw, with un&s;peakable re|gret, the peace of my Lord de&s;troyed during this vi&s;it. A depre&s;&s;ion, he could hardly account for, filled up the intervals we pa&s;&s;ed together; and, in&s;tead of employ|ing them in forming any rea&s;onable plan, nothing remained of all our mutual ten|derne&s;s but &s;ilence, &s;ighs, and tears.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, in defiance of time and un|der&s;tanding, indulged a romantic ta&s;te incon&s;i&s;tent with either; and, not &s;atis|fied with real pre-eminence, affected to be deified by the flattery of ver&s;e. The Lady of the Lake was the title &s;he cho&s;e to be known by here, and nothing art could invent, or wealth procure, was wanting to render the various pageants complete. A boat &s;cooped like a &s;hell, and enclosing a throne, conveyed her to the aight, where I and many more, ha|bited like Nere&iuml;ds, waited to receive her, and u&s;hering her to a grotto inlaid with &s;hells and looking-gla&s;s, we pre&s;ented her,

<P>I found, with &s;urprize, Lord Leice&s;ter feared the eyes of every indifferent &s;pec|tator would penetrate through a my&s;tery, Elizabeth only had an intere&s;t in deve|loping. It is the common weakne&s;s of humanity to bend the attention &s;olely to minute objects, while the leading ones come upon us totally unawares. &mdash;I, on the contrary, fancied my&s;elf every mo|ment &s;urveyed with a har&s;h air by an in|flexible imperial rival. &mdash;Every lady of the court, under the pretext of &s;eeking our intimacy, continually &s;ounded Ellinor and my&s;elf on our real condition, and the timid incoherent manner in which we an|&s;wered, gave me the mo&s;t mortal fears of their enployer. &mdash;Abject &s;laves to the Queen's amu&s;ement, &s;he kept us conti|nually

"Ah! why, thought I, did I leave the happy &s;olitude in which &s;he placed me, only to ruin the object of my affections, and deliver my&s;elf up to an inexorable tyrant, who can now wreak her malice without even being &s;u&s;pected!" In&s;en&s;ible to the gay crowd who addre&s;&s;ed me, I ob&s;erved my Lord reply to her ea|ger que&s;tions with he&s;itation and anxiety; as he talked, he fixed his eyes on me with the unea&s;y air of a per&s;on who wi&s;hes to convey through them what he is hopele&s;s

of making you comprehend any other way. I re&s;olved to prevent an error on my part, by a timely retreat; when &s;ud|denly &s;peaking aloud, Lord Leice&s;ter ad|vanced towardsus: &mdash;"Mark well all I &s;ay," &s;aid he, in a whi&s;per, leading me and my &s;i&s;ter to the &s;eat of the Queen, &mdash;"I &s;hall more &s;urpri&s;e the&s;e children, &s;aid he, with the knowledge of their origin than your Maje&s;ty&mdash;it is needle&s;s to give them the rea&s;ons I have laid before you for this &s;ecrecy; it mu&s;t be &s;ufficient honor and plea&s;ure for them to find them&s;elves daughters of the hou&s;e of Dudley, and objects of their Sovereign's gracious pa|tronage." Seeing him bend his knee, ours, &s;tubborn and reluctant as they were, gave way, and we ki&s;&s;ed the fatal hand &s;he maje&s;tically tendered. She informed us, &s;he added us to her train of maids of honor, and &s;hould carry us with her on the morrow towards London.&mdash;Lord Lei|ce&s;ter, charmed with having eluded all her &s;u&s;picions, dreamt not of the &s;nare he had wound round his own heart in yielding us up to Elizabeth, who&s;e con&s;ummate art

induced her to give credit to a mo&s;t im|probable fiction, on purpo&s;e to place us beyond his reach, which &s;he could no other way have effected.</P>
<P>The hour of re&s;t enabled him to open all his heart. &mdash;I under&s;tood that Eliza|beth had addre&s;&s;ed him in &s;o deci&s;ive a manner on the conviction of our being born above our pre&s;ent rank, that he could not hope to &s;ave us from the mo&s;t menial degradations but by a fal&s;e confi|dence; Heaven in&s;pired him with the idea of a po&s;&s;ibility, that his brother, the Lord Guildford, might have married Lady Jane Grey, a twelvemonth ere the two politic Dukes of Suffolk and North|umberland thought it prudent to appear leagued; during which, he declared the unfortunate Lady Jane gave birth to us both: the &s;ame policy induced them to conceal this event till the Suffolk family &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, and that hope being for ever defeated, prudence &s;till buried us in oblivion; &mdash;finally, that the &s;e|cret re&s;ted now only in his own bo&s;om, from Whence his attachment to Elizabeth would

never &s;uffer it to tran&s;pire, and that if the Queen &s;till wi&s;hed to patroni&s;e us, he thought it would be prudent to let us imagine our&s;elves his own illegitimate daughters.&mdash;To all this Elizabeth replied little, but &s;uffering him to &s;ettle it his own way, per&s;i&s;ted only in taking us from him.</P>
<P>Her mode of conduct convinced me at once that &s;he utterly di&s;credited the whole of this fiction; which allied us, by another branch, almo&s;t as near to the throne as we really &s;tood. Would not a jealous, &s;elfi&s;h &s;oul, like hers, have demanded dates, facts, te&s;timonials and witne&s;&s;es? Would &s;he not have made us undergo the fate of Lady Catherine, the legal heir of the hou&s;e of Suffolk, whom, by a barbarous, unfeminine u&s;e of power, &s;he tore from the mo&s;t near and &s;acred of human tyes, and condemned, even in the bloom of youth, to a &s;olitary life of impri&s;on|ment, only for having dared to become a wife and mother?&mdash;Would not, in a word, all the fury of her temper have

<P>Unwilling to add to the angui&s;h of this moment by one &s;urmi&s;e, I threw my|&s;elf into his arms, and &s;ilent, &s;peechle&s;s, &s;trained him to my heart&mdash;&s;upplicating, mentally, that God who alone could pro|tect us.

<PB N="218" REF="223">
By a caprice for which there is no accounting, Elizabeth, who&s;e eyes were ever watchful, and heart &s;u&s;picious, bent both for ever on Ellinor; who endured from her, with &s;ilent indignation, a thou|&s;and pa&s;&s;ionate extravagancies.

<P>The fair Pembroke attached her&s;elf particularly to Ellinor, and Ro&s;e Cecil, Lord Burleigh's &s;econd daughter, pro|fe&s;&s;ed an unbounded friend&s;hip for me.

He was not mi&s;taken in the fir&s;t opinion: the ten|der bloom both of her mind and per&s;on, attached to her a thou&s;and hearts, but though in all other in&s;tances compliance it&s;elf, in the article of marriage, &s;he re|fu&s;ed to obey even the Queen, who con|&s;equently hated her. This &s;ad confor|mity of &s;ituation, both were at liberty alike to lament, and with the candor in|cident to youth, I found it difficult to limit my lamentations.

<P>On &s;o important an event as the expected inva&s;ion, the Engli&s;h were all prepared to take arms: Lord Leice&s;ter, as their leader, was already encamped; and I parted with him in common with the other Courtiers, without the privilege of utter|ing a &s;yllable that might give peace to his heart or my own.

readily con&s;ented to my &s;pending a month with Lady Arundell, who received me with infinite plea&s;ure. I found &s;he had been only appri&s;ed of my marriage, and that my Lord &s;till withheld the &s;ecret of my birth. She allotted me a magnificent apartment, which concluded with a &s;a|loon opening to the Thames. This no|ble room was embelli&s;hed with valuable paintings, &s;ome of which were not yet fini&s;hed, and a painter of eminence fre|quently attended to complete them. This man was employed by her to take a pic|ture of me, which might fill up the interval of my Lord's ab&s;ence, as well as agreeably &s;urpri&s;e him. I was one day dre&s;&s;ed gaily for this purpo&s;e, and waiting in the &s;aloon. I perceived the man enter, but how was I &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him a moment after at my feet! I turned indignantly towards him. Ah, heavens! it was my Lord, my Lei|ce&s;ter him&s;elf! who &s;afe in that di&s;gui&s;e, which he and Lady Arundell had agreed on, was to forbid the painter whenever he could vi&s;it us with &s;afety. We learnt from him news of the utmo&s;t importance,
<PB N="231" REF="236">
that Heaven it&s;elf had fought for Eliza|beth, and defeated an armada her power could ill have coped with. This intel|ligence, by &s;ecuring Lord Leice&s;ter, joyed even my heart; and the pride of forgiving being added to the plea&s;ure of loving, life could be&s;tow no more on me.</P>
<P>I had now learnt to be beforehand with &s;u&s;picion; and as Sir Philip, charmed with the opportunity of &s;eeing me out of the chilling circle of a Court, was almo&s;t a daily vi&s;itor, I re&s;olved to end his hopes, even at the ri&s;que of an implied con|fidence.

<P><PB N="232" REF="237">Having formed my re&s;olution, I per|mitted him one day to lead me to the ter|race.

"Alas! Sir Philip, cried I, why am I re|duced to tell you, your merit and your attachment are by a combination of events|my only misfortunes?"</P>

<P>Ri&s;ing, he quitted me, and walked towards his barge, with &s;ad and irre&s;olute &s;teps, frequently looking back as if he was ready to return, and recant his decla|ration: but the barge &s;wiftly conveying him toward London, I gave free vent to

<P>The following evening Lord Leice&s;ter had promi&s;ed to pa&s;s with us: he arrived with an air of &s;atisfaction it was impo&s;&s;i|ble I could avoid &s;haring, even while ig|norant of its cau&s;e. "Who would rely on the con&s;tancy of a lover, &s;aid he, with a happy &s;mile, &s;ince even my Matil|da's charms could not retain my nephew's attachment! He has &s;ollicited the Queen's con&s;ent to marry Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham; you know her love for him, but his &s;udden re|turn of it, amazes all acquainted with both. Elizabeth calls him a whim&s;ical fool, but does not care to offend Sir Francis by refu&s;ing her con&s;ent, however di&s;plea&s;ed at his thus matching him&s;elf&mdash;the marriage will be celebrated in a few days, and my Matilda is invited to her rival's triumph."</P>
<P>"Ah no, I &s;hould have returned, had his jealou&s;y not taught me caution, thy Matilda has a triumph of her own to enjoy." Alas, I now under&s;tood Sidney's parting words, and my heart floated in

tears tinctured &s;o &s;trongly with every &s;et|timent but love, that I could hardly di&s;|tingui&s;h whether that had not a &s;hare in the &s;ublimity of the moment.</P>
<P>My Lord pre&s;&s;ed me to return to Court previous to the ceremony; he even gave o it I meant to do &s;o, and this I only un|der&s;tood by a line which accompanied the formal invitations &s;ent to me and Lady Arundel. "Ah Madam, added Sir Philip, in the po&s;tcript, is it true that you return ere my &s;acrifice is compleated?"</P>
<P>"No, I will not return, &s;ighed I, a hu&s;|band's claims extend no farther, and hu|manity re&s;umes its rights."</P>
<P>The dread that malicious ob&s;ervers might once more pry into Lord Leice&s;|ter's moments of retirement, at la&s;t con|quered the reluctance I felt at returning to Court. I &s;aw, in defiance of danger, &s;elf-|indulgence continually increa&s;ed upon him. At fir&s;t, a few hours of the evening were all he devoted to me and Lady

<P>A &s;ad and &s;ilent admiration was the only expre&s;&s;ion of my features at &s;ight of Sir Philip; he &s;ighed at the compliment indi&s;pen&s;able due, which his bride re|ceived with a cold contempt. To a coun|tenance naturally har&s;h and inqui&s;itive, however beautiful, Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham had always united a temper, proud, pa&s;&s;ionate, and peevi&s;h.

ignorant of a pa&s;&s;ion he had &s;o often been rallied upon, and the moment he found it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to make his own choice, he generou&s;ly re&s;olved to in|dulge hers.

Incapable of bending &s;o noble a mind to the little triumph of conquering a low one, and as incapable of regulating his life by-the narrow rules &s;he would have laid down for him, he &s;aw no al|ternative but the pur&s;uit of glory, and &s;ollicited to be &s;ent to his government of Flu&s;hing.</P>

<P>The la&s;t tender con&s;ideration entirely &s;ubdued a &s;park of di&s;plea&s;ure excited by the former. I &s;ubmitted my wavering re&s;olutions to her direction, and wrote an anonymous letter, de&s;criptive of my &s;itu|ation, which, with innumerable charges, Lady Arundel delivered to Lord Brook, the di&s;tingui&s;hed friend of Sir Philip Sid|ney, to convey into Lord Leice&s;ter's own hands. That amiable woman became the confident of my pre&s;ent fear, and with unwearied kindne&s;s conjured me to rely upon her conduct&mdash;in her hou&s;e &s;he a&s;|&s;ured me of an a&s;ylum, and in her&s;elf of another mother for the unfortunate infant.

Lord a partaker in cares, he was &s;o little able to relieve. By her advice I &s;ummoned courage to appear again in the Court. "We &s;eldom, &s;aid the prudent Lady Arun|del, critici&s;e tho&s;e we &s;ee every day; no|velty alone attracts curio&s;ity; and if you are ab&s;ent any time, &s;ome eye of the many your return will attract, may pierce through every veil into the cau&s;e. I will carefully watch, and when nece&s;&s;ary, warn you to retreat."</P>
<P>I found on my return, the fair Ro&s;e Cecil had quitted London by the com|mand of her father, who was highly in|cen&s;ed, alike at her refu&s;al of a very ad|vantageous match, and the pa&s;&s;ion which cau&s;ed it. The lo&s;s of her &s;ociety, which at another time I &s;hould have lamented, be|came an advantage in the pre&s;ent delicate conjuncture. I no longer dur&s;t wi&s;h for companions I could not keep at a di&s;tance; and I hoped ere we met again I &s;hould be more at liberty to cultivate the attachment &s;he profe&s;&s;ed to me, while time would have
<PB N="245" REF="250">
conquered that unfortunate one which alone could interfere with it.</P>
<P>I counted the moments ere a letter could arrive from my Lord&mdash;in vain Elli|nor a&s;&s;ured me the time was in&s;ufficient, had Lord Brook's journey met with no delay. We were talking this over one morning, when a loud knocking at the door much earlier than u&s;ual, &s;tartled us both; how was I amazed a moment after to &s;ee my Lord ru&s;h in, booted, and with that di&s;ordered dre&s;s and air which &s;hewed him ju&s;t arrived! Pale, and &s;peechle&s;s, I threw my&s;elf into his arms, and made no other return to his embraces than by &s;ighs and tears, while Ellinor, &s;truck with the &s;ingularity of his conduct, repeatedly de|manded how he came there?&mdash;"To &s;ee, to &s;ave my love, cried he, fixing his eyes on mine with unutterable fondne&s;s; will not my Matilda ble&s;s. me with another &s;elf? and could I be &s;uch a &s;avage to leave her to face the pain, the grief, the danger alone? Dry your tears, my mo&s;t beloved, am not I with you? I, whom
<PB N="246" REF="251">
you have made the happie&s;t of mankind; I, who was born but to wor&s;hip you?"&mdash;"Imprudent! cried I &s;triking my own bo&s;om&mdash;alas, my love, how is it I &s;ee you here?" It &s;eemed as if rea&s;on, like light, pierced at once through the chaos of his mind. Ab&s;orbed in the &s;ingle con&s;idera|tion of my &s;ituation, he had po&s;ted to England without re&s;ting a moment on the receipt of my letter, nor could find a cau&s;e might &s;atisfy even indifferent ob|&s;ervers, much more the jealous &s;oul of Elizabeth.&mdash;"Ah, heavens! we are now indeed ruined, cried I, wringing my hands, the implacable enemy of my peace will become &s;o of yours, and every mali|cious eye will now be fixed on her who &s;inks under the mo&s;t ca&s;ual ob&s;ervation. &mdash;Oh that the &s;ilent man&s;ion in which I &s;o long vegetated had been my grave, &s;ince I quitted it but to become a misfor|tune to the man I love?"&mdash;"Why will my Matilda, returned Lord Leice&s;ter, with a noble mildne&s;s, monopolize love and genero&s;ity? Perhaps I have yet &s;uffi|cient influence over Elizabeth, to per|&s;uade

her, fears for her welfare alone brought me home; but even if not, &s;hall I refu&s;e to bear a &s;ingle mortification for her &s;ake who has borne &s;o many for mine?&mdash;The wor&s;t &s;he can di&s;cover is our marriage; your birth is beyond the power of malice. Summon all your fortitude, my love, and let us concert every mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to our mutual &s;afety, for I will take every care of my&s;elf you would wi&s;h, me. Never more, I &s;olemnly &s;wear, will your hu&s;band leave you. Dreams of for|tune and favor fade away before the re|alities of life; let us, with our darling &s;i&s;|ter, &s;eek a &s;helter in France; I want not the means of affluence, independent of the Queen. Let us then avow our union, and thus convert my dear Matilda's ten|derne&s;s, always her fir&s;t charm, alike into her virtue and her happine&s;s. There, &s;afe from the vengeance of Elizabeth, we may, without fear or di&s;haonor, quietly await her di&s;&s;olution. Imagine, my love, the exqui&s;ite tran&s;port of encircling the Throne of your mother with lovely
<PB N="248" REF="253">
pledges of our union; &s;o while empire fills every power of her imagination, na|ture may throb through every pul&s;e to her heart."</P>
<P>The fond, fond vi&s;ion floated alike through my brain! Lord Leice&s;ter, indif|ferent to the opinion of the Queen, re&s;olv|ed to wait on her without entering into the rea&s;ons of his return, which was already known through the Court. Elizabeth had for &s;ome time kept her chamber, never|thele&s;s &s;he permitted him an audience ere &s;he left her bed. I knew her capricious temper, and while meditating what line &s;he meant to pur&s;ue, &s;everal of her ladies then in waiting came out of her chamber; the la&s;t of whom told me it was her plea|&s;ure I alone &s;hould witne&s;s her conver&s;a|tion with Lord Leice&s;ter. Con&s;cience &s;hivered my whole frame, and I entered the apartment as a condemned wretch would that where the rack was preparing. Lord Leice&s;ter, equally &s;urprized, pointed out by an expre&s;&s;ive glance a place where the clo&s;ed curtain would prevent her re|marking
<PB N="249" REF="254">
the changes of my countenance; and thither, more dead than alive, I took my &s;tation. "Leice&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, in a langui&s;hing voice, thy unexpected return upon the news of my indi&s;po&s;ition, is a fre&s;h mark of thy watchful duty and un|wearied pa&s;&s;ion. I have long re&s;i&s;ted that tender inclination which di&s;tingui&s;hed thee in earlie&s;t youth; but now, when I have no potent enemy to fear, I may crown thy pa&s;&s;ion and indulge my own, without endangering my&s;elf or the &s;tate. &mdash;A new plot I have di&s;covered to relea&s;e Mary, renders it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould, by marrying, cut off her hopes and tho&s;e of her party; I &s;hall now, in turn, &s;urpri&s;e them. Long have I weighed the bu&s;ine&s;s in my mind, and frequently determined to recall thee; but thy return, by evincing the &s;trength of thy tender|ne&s;s, demands an immediate recompence. &mdash;Take then at la&s;t the &s;o-long-withheld hand of Elizabeth, who thus re&s;igns all authority over thee, except that thy heart gives her." She pau&s;ed, extending a
<PB N="250" REF="255">
withered hand. Lord Leice&s;ter confu&s;ed beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, and expecting me to drop &s;en&s;ele&s;s every moment, he&s;itated a few broken &s;entences of faint gratitude, and ki&s;&s;ed the fatal hand &s;he no longer drew from him, fixing a moment after his eyes on me; and oh, how compre|hen&s;ive was the look! &mdash;"I perceive by thy trembling, my Lord, continued &s;he, how much I have &s;urprized thee. Reco|ver thy&s;elf. &mdash;My election of thee is ex|pected by every one, and &s;hall be imme|diate to mortify Mary. I find my&s;elf well enough to quit my chamber; it is my in|tention thou &s;houlde&s;t lead me hence this evening, and, by taking a regal &s;eat un|der the &s;ame canopy, prepare the kingdom for the declaration I purpo&s;e making to|morrow. The ceremony of e&s;pou&s;al will demand time and &s;plendor, but never more &s;halt thou quit her who finds, after trying every effort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to live with|out thee."</P>
<P>There are in&s;tances in nature of timid beings whom darkne&s;s merely would de|prive

of their &s;en&s;es, who yet, on de&s;pe|rate emergencies, encounter the jarring elements without &s;hrinking. &mdash;I, who had till that moment been compo&s;ed of tears and trembling, now found I mu&s;t no longer hang a helple&s;s weight on the heart of my hu&s;band, and ble&s;&s;ing the caprice which made her &s;elect me as the only wit|ne&s;s of her dotage, I leant again&s;t the ta|pe&s;try, and endeavoured, by a &s;elf-col|lected air, to arm him for the occa&s;ion. I had the mi&s;ery to &s;ee his fortitude dimi|ni&s;h in proportion as mine increa&s;ed, and that after &s;truggling with his feelings till almo&s;t convul&s;ed, he was obliged to quit the pre&s;ence of the Queen precipitately, and &s;carcely could his failing limbs con|vey him thence. The ladies, before di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, now entering, the Queen called the Lady Latimer to her bed&s;ide, and I fol|lowed the foot&s;teps of my Lord. &mdash;"Hea|vens and earth, cried I, on looking round in vain for him, what is now to become of me!" Even Ellinor, my only comfort, fate had cruelly robbed me of, nor was &s;he to be found throughout the whole pa|lace.
<PB N="252" REF="257">
Ere the tumults of my mind could &s;ub&s;ide into recollection, I was informed Lady Arundel's barge waited to convey me to Chel&s;ea, where &s;he was greatly in|di&s;po&s;ed. Ea&s;ily imagining this was a feint of Lord Leice&s;ter's, to unfold his &s;enti|ments to me in &s;afety, I ha&s;tened into it, and was conveyed to the fatal &s;aloon on the banks of the Thames, once con|&s;ecrated to love and plea&s;ure only. I found Lord Leice&s;ter alone with his niece, mea&s;uring the apartment with unequal &s;teps and a di&s;tracted air; he took my hand, and &s;oftening with pity for my &s;ituation, led me to a &s;eat, and threw him&s;elf by me. His tears bedewed the hand he ki&s;&s;ed. &mdash;"Support your&s;elf &s;till, my &s;oul, &s;aid he, the cri&s;is is come unawares; and fate is beforehand with our intentions. Elizabeth indeed has &s;urprized me, but as her pa&s;&s;ion, however weak and ab&s;urd, is generous, it now &s;tabs me to the heart. &mdash; To &s;uffer her to publi&s;h it to the world, to &s;tamp with ridicule my Sovereign, my benefactre&s;s, would no doubt awaken her

It has indeed; for even at the mo|ment the Queen in tender confidence im|parted to me a plot to relea&s;e Mary, &s;he meant to obviate by her own marriage, my &s;ecret &s;oul upbraided me as an abet|tor, if not a principal in that plot. &mdash;Hap|py in the idea of &s;urpri&s;ing you with its event, and far from expecting &s;o extraor|dinary a one on the part of the Queen, I find by papers Lord Burleigh gave me ere I entered her apartment, that the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic a&s;&s;i&s;tants of Mary premeditated the martyrdom of Elizabeth, and have rea&s;on to imagine, &s;he by this time knows the man whom &s;he was willing to level with her&s;elf, has been capable of &s;o infamous a concealment. Nay, how do I know how far I may be included in the barbarity? She may be led to believe, the hand to which &s;he gave her own an hour ago,

How could it e&s;cape you that the Rece&s;s may &s;till &s;upply a &s;ad and dear a&s;ylum till we can judge of cir|cum&s;tances?" &mdash;The thought had indeed occurred to me, but I dared not name the memorial of the pre&s;ent misfortune. I examined his eyes in &s;ilence. "My gentle love, my &s;weet Matilda, can I re&s;olve to grieve thee, &s;ighed he, &s;peak, would you wi&s;h me to conduct you thither?" My tears only allowed me to pronounce, "yes." "Yet how, re&s;umed he, is it po&s;&s;ible? &mdash;How can you &s;up|port the inevitable fatigues of the jour|ney, with the addition of its fears in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation?" "I can &s;up|port any thing, every thing, &s;obbed I in|articulately, but the idea of your danger." "Yes, my love, added he, ki&s;&s;ing away my tears, I will, if po&s;&s;ible, live to re|ward your unexampled tenderne&s;s. Lady Arundel think for us, &s;ugge&s;t the mode of our departure." "It &s;hould be &s;udden, cried our generous friend, and how can either be &s;ufficiently di&s;gui&s;ed, or how

&s;hall we find proper attendants." "We will have none with us, returned Lord Leice&s;ter, I rely on your care to &s;ummon Le Val from Kenilworth Ca&s;tle; he is ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret of the Rece&s;s, whi|ther he can follow us, and convey with care, at different times, the trea&s;ure hoarded in the Ca&s;tle; while with the ve|nerable fo&s;ter-father of my love, we wait your farther informations." &mdash;"Ah, how happy was it, added I, your fond|ne&s;s obliged me to ride! now can I follow you fearle&s;s of any thing but Eli|zabeth.

<P>The amiable Lady Arundell provided all in the manner required, and we &s;et

off immediately. Ere &s;un-&s;et we reached a pea&s;ant's cot near St. Alban's, where my Lord in&s;i&s;ted we might with &s;afety take a little re&s;t, which indeed I greatly re|quired. Accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s and repa&s;s that road for ever, he fancied he remem|bered every face he &s;aw, and I too &s;urely thought all remembered him. Our ru&s;|tic ho&s;t and his wife &s;eemed ju&s;t to have under&s;tanding enough to connect the idea of my&s;tery with us, and I rou&s;ed my Lord ere break of day, &s;ecretly re&s;olving no more to enter a hou&s;e till we reached our a&s;ylum. Even the pro|fu&s;e recompence my Lord be&s;towed on the pea&s;ants, rather according with his &s;oul than his appearance, excited their &s;u&s;picions; they pre&s;&s;ed us to &s;tay in a manner which pointed mine, and we de|parted with a precipitation which I dare &s;ay confirmed theirs: pur&s;uing our jour|ney by roads little frequented, Lord Leice&s;ter being perfectly acquainted with the ground. I went through incredible fa|tigues without complaint; riding the whole

day with no other refre&s;hment than a draught of new milk, &s;upplied by a girl as we pa&s;&s;ed along; till as the &s;un was declining, we reached a brow which commanded St. Vincent's Abbey.

And the venerable Father Anthony, with what joy&mdash;ah! with what &s;orrow will he re|ceive us&mdash;forewarned even by our pre|&s;ence of affliction, he will hardly dare to indulge the rapture of a moment."&mdash;Every &s;entiment and &s;en&s;ation mingling thus in my mind filled the interval ere we arrived at the &s;pot, where my heart re|cognized the minute&s;t object. Alight|ing at &s;ome di&s;tance, Lord Leice&s;ter fa&s;|tened the hor&s;es in an ob&s;cure part of the wood, and we proceeded on foot to the hermit's cave. Evening began now to gloom over the hemi&s;phere.&mdash;I had before agreed not to open my lips, till my Lord had by degrees revealed him|&s;elf to Father Anthony, who&s;e enfeebled &s;en&s;es might not be able to re&s;i&s;t the &s;urpri&s;e; but how did that return upon our&s;elves, when a voice with which we

were unacquainted replied to us without opening the door! Heart-&s;truck, I caught the arm of Lord Leice&s;ter, who eagerly enquired after the hermit. "He has been dead the&s;e ten days, returned the man, and is interred among the Scroope family in the vault of St. Vincent's Ab|bey: I am placed here to protect the few effects he left behind, till his relati|ons &s;hall direct what is to be done with them."&mdash;"And thus vani&s;h our hopes of &s;afety, peace, and plea&s;ure, &s;ighed I, turn|ing di&s;con&s;olately from the cave." "Oh, fainted Anthony, I have now no tears for thee, and that lo&s;s I lately &s;hould have &s;hed floods for, is now heard with indif|ference. Where, wretched wanderers as we are, where now can we betake our|&s;elves? Had we &s;taid in London, friend|&s;hip, nay intere&s;t, might have &s;heltered us; here I am as well known as you are there, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of St. Vincent's Abbey will infallibly di&s;cover both. Nay we know not who tho&s;e are, and whether we might not throw our&s;elves into the power

of our wor&s;t enemies."&mdash;"Alas my love, what do you &s;uffer for my &s;ake! it is in vain to affect &s;trength; nature fails, and I mu&s;t re&s;t if only on the damp earth."&mdash;"Gracious God! exclaimed Lord Lei|ce&s;ter, &s;upporting me in his arms, how have we de&s;erved this accumulation of evils? Let us wind through the wood; who knows, my Matilda, but providence has left the gate of the tomb open to &s;hel|ter us? It is plain the pea&s;ant who inha|bits the cave is not acquainted with the &s;ecrets of father Anthony, and in all pro|bability that of the Rece&s;s died with him.

<P>Though faint between want of nouri&s;h|ment and exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, I yet &s;trove to follow my Lord, but did it &s;o &s;lowly, that night entirely involved us ere we reached the tomb.
