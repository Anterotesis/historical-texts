<L>And brought the welcome plaudit to his ear!</L>
<L>But while he now revolves that mutual fame</L>
<L>Should join the poet's and the actor's name,</L>
<L>O! let him here one tender tribute pay,</L>

<L>While to the friend this grateful debt he pays,</L>

<L>With you, his hone&s;t zeal mu&s;t &s;tand approv'd,</L>

<L>WHAT horrors fill the tragic poet's brain!</L>
<L>Plague, murder, rape, and ince&s;t, croud his train;</L>
<L>He pants for mi&s;eries, delights in ills,</L>
<L>The blood of fathers, mothers, children, &s;pills;</L>
<L>Stabs, poi&s;ons, ma&s;&s;acres; and, in his rage,</L>
<L>With daggers, bowls, and carpets, &s;trews the &s;tage.</L>

<LG>
<L>Our gentler poet, in &s;oft opera bred,</L>
<L>Italian crotchets &s;inging in his head,</L>
<L>Winds to a pro&s;p'rous end the fine-drawn tale,</L>
<L>And roars&mdash;but roars like any nightingale.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woman, whate'er &s;he be&mdash;maid, widow, wife,</L>
<L>A quiet woman is the charm of life:</L>
<L>And &s;ure Cephi&s;a was a gentle creature,</L>
<L>Fuil of the milk and honey of good-nature.</L>
<L>Imported for a &s;pou&s;e&mdash;by &s;pou&s;e refus'd!</L>
<L>Was ever maid &s;o &s;hamefully abus'd?</L>
<L>And yet, alas, poor prince! I could not blame him&mdash;</L>
<L>One wife, I'knew, was full enough to tame him.</L>
<L>I&s;mena, and Timanthes, and Olinthus,</L>
<L>Might all be happy&mdash;for I cho&s;e Cherinthus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what a barb'rous law was this of Thrace!</L>
<L>How cruel <HI>there</HI> was each young lady's ca&s;e!</L>
<L>A virgin, plac'd upon the dreadful roll,</L>
<L>A haple&s;s virgin mu&s;t have &s;tood the poll,</L>
