<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE our hero went to Port|man-&s;quare, he called at his former lodgings, to enquire for the &s;ervant who had attended him during his re&s;idence in town. The man was en|gaged; but the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in|formed him "he knew another whom he could recommend in every re|&s;pect." Sir George agreed to take him, and de&s;ired he might follow him to Lord Milbanke's, where ac|cordingly he arrived that evening; and our hero being much plea&s;ed
<PB N="2" REF="3">
with his appearance, and finding him at once &s;teady, active, and diligent, determined to engage him as a regu|lar &s;ervant. On a&s;king him if he would be willing to leave London, and re&s;ide with him in Northumber|land, the man replied, "he would follow him with plea&s;ure any whi|ther; but that Northumberland was his native county, and he &s;hould mo&s;t truly rejoice to return to it."</P>
<P>"To what part of it do you be|long?" &s;aid Sir George.</P>
<P>"To Warrington, your honour; farmer Bever, your tenant, is my fa|ther."</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">"I am very glad I happened to meet with you," &s;aid Sir George; "your father is as hone&s;t a man as any in the village, and I &s;hall be happy to have one of his family in my &s;ervice. But how came you to be di&s;engaged?"</P>
<P>"I am afraid, Sir," returned the man, "if I tell you I left my la&s;t place in di&s;grace as it were, you will have a bad opinion of me; but indeed I was not to blame: if you will hear the whole &s;tory, I am &s;ure you will think &s;o."</P>
<P>Sir George replied, "Very willing|ly;" and the &s;ervant began:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">"I lived &s;everal years with Mrs. Barclay in her fir&s;t hu&s;band's time; and, when &s;he married Mr. Saxby and went abroad, &s;he cho&s;e me out of the family as her attendant."</P>
<P>"Mr. Saxby!" interrupted our hero with &s;urpri&s;e and emotion&mdash; "Did you live with him?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," &s;aid the man, a&s;to|ni&s;hed at his vehemence.</P>
<P>"Well then, go on," cried Sir George.</P>
<P>The fellow obeyed; and mention|ed his meeting with Loui&s;a More|land,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
her di&s;tre&s;s, and his contriving with Lucy Clerke to bring her as far as Montreuil, word for word as Loui&s;a had her&s;elf related it, and went on thus:</P>
<P>"At Montreuil we were to &s;tay &s;ome weeks; and in the mean time I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the young lady &s;et off for England, with two nuns who had been turned out of their convent; and very glad I was. But, as ill-luck would have it, &s;ome|how or other my mi&s;tre&s;s di&s;covered what we had done; and being, poor lady! a little jealous, though indeed &s;he has &s;ome rea&s;on for it, could not be per&s;uaded that we did it out of
<PB N="6" REF="7">
compa&s;&s;ion, but fancied Ma&s;ter had &s;ome hand in it. She was, therefore, &s;o angry with Lucy and my&s;elf, that &s;he &s;aid '&s;he would not keep us a mi|nute after we got to London, and that we might think our&s;elves very well off that &s;he did not turn us adrift upon foreign ground.' So we were di&s;charged here, and Mr. and Mrs. Saxby went down to Barclay Manor. To be &s;ure, I was very &s;orry, as I wanted to &s;ee my father and mother when I had been away &s;o long: but I did not like to go down and &s;ay I had been turned off, but wi&s;hed to get me a place here; and if your honour takes me as your &s;er|vant, I &s;hall be very proud indeed,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
and can &s;hew my face at Warrington with the greater plea&s;ure becau&s;e I've bettered my&s;elf by the ex|change."</P>
<P>Sir George, who knew the truth of all he had a&s;&s;erted, was extremely plea&s;ed at having gained an atten|dant of who&s;e principles he had &s;o high an opinion; at the &s;ame time felt gratified by the conviction that he had not been wholly impo&s;ed up|on, &s;ince Loui&s;a's &s;tory was no fic|tion, however &s;trangely &s;he had &s;ince derogated from her natural charac|ter. He now told James "he had acted like a humane and benevolent man, and that he &s;hould be no lo&s;er;"
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and then enquired where his fellow-&s;ervant was.</P>
<P>James replied&mdash;"With an aunt in the Borough, waiting till &s;he could get a place." A &s;ummons to dinner now put an end to their conver&s;ation for the pre&s;ent; and Sir George went down &s;tairs, more than ever perplex|ed how to reconcile the incon&s;i&s;ten|cies in Loui&s;a's character. At table he ob&s;erved Lady Milbanke was un|commonly dejected; and, when &s;he left the gentlemen over their wine, he expre&s;&s;ed his fears that &s;he was ill. "No," replied his Lord&s;hip, "not ill, but grieved at the re&s;ult of an enquiry we made this morning for
<PB N="9" REF="10">
her niece, whom &s;he expected from France, as we have rea&s;on to fear her &s;ituation is very forlorn, but can obtain no certain intelligence."</P>
<P>"May I a&s;k the particulars?" &s;aid our hero.</P>
<P>Certainly," returned Lord Mil|banke. "About twelve or fourteen years ago, and ju&s;t before we were married, Sophia's half brother Mr. Moreland went abroad to re&s;ide, en|raged at the lo&s;s of a law-&s;uit, and extremely angry with his &s;i&s;ter be|cau&s;e &s;he refu&s;ed to give her evidence in his favour, though ju&s;tice for|bad it; for, in con&s;cience, had &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="11">
&s;aid any thing in court, it would have been again&s;t him, as &s;he was tho|roughly convinced his cau&s;e was not a ju&s;t one. In con&s;equence of this di&s;pute, he kept up no corre&s;pondence with her; but we occa&s;ionally heard of him from tho&s;e of our acquaint|ance who went through &mdash;; and learnt that he lived wholly a reclu&s;e from the world, and had placed his daughter as a boarder in a convent; and we &s;ome time &s;ince were inform|ed of his death, and that &s;he meant to remain in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Lady Milbanke then, at my particu|lar reque&s;t, wrote to offer her an a&s;y|lum with us; but we have too much rea&s;on to fear the letter never reached
<PB N="11" REF="12">
her, as about that time the convent was de&s;troyed, and all its unfortunate inhabitants turned loo&s;e on the wide world. On hearing this, we made a point of enquiring for our young relation among the emigrants who hourly flocked to London, and at la&s;t were fortunate enough to meet with &s;ome ladies who had belonged to the &s;ame convent, and learnt Loui&s;a Moreland had refu&s;ed to ac|company them, becau&s;e &s;he would not leave the Abbe&s;s, who was then in a very ill &s;tate of health. We then wrote to her again, but received no an&s;wer, and continued in the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;tate of &s;olicitude. A few days &s;ince we were accidentally in
<PB N="12" REF="13">
company with a Madame St. Val from Montreuil, who informed us that her&s;elf and a friend had been ac|companied to England by a Mi&s;s Moreland, who, on their arrival in town, had taken a place in one of the northern &s;tages, with an inten|tion to go as far as &mdash;, where &s;he told them her former nur&s;e re|&s;ided, who, &s;he was a&s;&s;ured, would receive and protect her. On learn|ing this, we in&s;tantly di&s;patched a &s;ervant to &mdash;, who returned this morning, and &s;aid 'no lady of that name or de&s;cription had been &s;een in the village, and that the farmer whom Madame St. Val had men|tioned was dead as well as his wife.'
<PB N="13" REF="14">
This is the real cau&s;e of Lady Mil|banke's dejection, as the uncertainty of Loui&s;a's &s;ituation, &s;o young and, as we are told, extremely hand&s;ome, fills her with a thou&s;and apprehen|&s;ions for her &s;afety. Various are the temptations &s;he may meet with, and, &s;trangers as we are to her mind and principles, who can tell whether &s;he may have power to re&s;i&s;t them!"</P>
<P>Sir George a&s;&s;ented to this with a deep &s;igh, for he too well knew they had not a&s;&s;ailed her in vain; con|&s;cious, from the beginning of the &s;tory. Lady Milbanke's niece and his once beloved Loui&s;a were the &s;ame. Indeed he had with difficulty
<PB N="14" REF="15">
concealed his emotions during the recital; but his uncle attributed them wholly to compa&s;&s;ion, and loved him the better for the intere&s;t he had taken in the unknown Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>At &s;upper the conver&s;ation was renewed, and Lady Milbanke ex|pre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t concern for her lo&s;t niece. Sir George, agitated as he was, did not let fall an expre&s;&s;ion that could give them an idea he had any knowledge of her&mdash;too &s;en&s;ible his information would only add to her unea&s;ine&s;s: and unwilling, if they &s;hould meet, to prejudice them in her disfavour, at the &s;ame time de|termined, on his return to the coun|try,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
to vi&s;it Mrs. Edgeworth, and if po&s;&s;ible learn from her where Mi&s;s Moreland now was, and then give her information where &s;he might gain a certain a&s;ylum if her beha|viour entitled her to protection. He now &s;aw tho&s;e features in Lady Mil|banke which he had &s;o much ad|mired at his fir&s;t introduction to her, were exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of her niece, and that they had both the &s;ame beautiful turn of countenance, the &s;ame brilliant and expre&s;&s;ive eyes.</P>
<P>Several days pa&s;&s;ed away very plea&s;antly. Our hero was in a new world, where every thing was de|lightful,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
and the &s;ociety &s;uperior to any he had ever before enjoyed; as Lord and Lady Milbanke rather &s;ought a plea&s;ant than a general ac|quaintance&mdash;men of wit and bril|liancy, but not men of the world&mdash; women of fa&s;hion, but not women of levity&mdash;tho&s;e who&s;e manners had received the highe&s;t poli&s;h; not that poli&s;h which de&s;troys the intrin&s;ic value of the metal, but that which adds to it&mdash;where virtue was not thrown a&s;ide as an old-fa&s;hioned gar|ment, but only &s;o well adorned as to appear like a new and becoming habit. Politics in the&s;e parties were a &s;ubject &s;eldom &s;tarted; and at home Lord Milbanke cautiou&s;ly
<PB N="17" REF="18">
avoided it, gue&s;&s;ing the &s;entiments of our hero were like tho&s;e of his father, and rather wi&s;hing he &s;hould be con|verted by a better knowledge of the world, than by the mere force of ar|guments he felt unwilling to employ le&s;t they &s;hould prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; and Sir George concealed his prin|ciples, from a certainty that they would not meet with his uncle's ap|probation.</P>
<P>One evening, when Lord Mil|banke, from a particular engagement, had not &s;een our hero during the day, he addre&s;&s;ed him on their fir&s;t meeting thus, but with a &s;mile: "Sir George, what are you about
<PB N="18" REF="19">
in London?&mdash;I am afraid, going on in a bad way, &s;ince you are obliged to &s;ell or pawn your plate."</P>
<P>"Pawn my plate!" returned he laughing, "That would be a bad &s;tory indeed. You mu&s;t not, my dear Sir, continue to countenance me if this be true; but, je&s;ting apart, what is it you mean?"</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, "you &s;hall have the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You mu&s;t know there is a young man whom I have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to the utmo&s;t of my power, but I fear with little effect; &s;ince the rage of gambling
<PB N="19" REF="20">
has &s;eized him, and, unle&s;s he &s;peedily reforms, mu&s;t reduce him to poverty. This morning I received a very pe|nitential letter from him, informing me he was reduced to his la&s;t &s;hilling, and had even pawned his watch for immediate &s;upport. Infinitely &s;hock|ed at this (for his father was a brave officer, belonging to the regiment I was once in), I re&s;olved to make one more effort to pre&s;erve him, and accord|ingly called at his lodgings, where I found all he had told me was too true. I gave him &s;ufficient for his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, and then bade him go with me to the pawnbroker's to redeem his watch, that I might not be impo&s;ed on. Having completed
<PB N="20" REF="21">
this bu&s;ine&s;s, I accidentally ca&s;t my eyes on an immen&s;e &s;ilver tankard, and di&s;covered the Warrington and Milbanke arms quartered; and this convinced me the cup belonged to your family. I a&s;ked the man care|le&s;sly from whence he had it; and the he&s;itation in his manner when he re|plied, a&s;&s;ured me it had not been obtained hone&s;tly. Tell me, have you lo&s;t &s;uch a thing?"</P>
<P>Sir George during this &s;peech had been &s;o much agitated, that he thought it prudent to di&s;clo&s;e the rea&s;on as far as it was in his power, without mentioning Loui&s;a.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">"Frankly then," returned he, "I will tell you all. I have not lo&s;t the cup; but it was given by my father, when I was chri&s;tened, to Mr. Thom|&s;on, the Vicar of Warrington, &s;ince my tutor: from him it has been &s;tolen, and I acknowledge through my means."</P>
<P>"What!" interrupted his Lord|&s;hip, "did you hire any body to <HI>recover</HI> it?"</P>
<P>"No indeed," cried Sir George laughing; "but, deceived by a tale of di&s;tre&s;s, I recommended a per&s;on to the attention of Mr. Thom&s;on,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
who repaid his care with the blacke&s;t ingratitude, taking an opportunity of carrying off not only that but &s;eve|ral other things of real value; and I am particularly glad of this intelli|gence, as I will go to-morrow to the pawnbroker's, and regain all I can."</P>
<P>"And will you not pro&s;ecute the villain, if you can find him?" &s;aid Lord Milbanke.</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied our hero faintly; "but I am &s;ure I &s;hall not meet with him. Indeed I have been deeply impo&s;ed upon; and it was the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
recollection of this that cau&s;ed the confu&s;ion you witne&s;&s;ed when you began your &s;tory."</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke now &s;aw the &s;ub|ject pained him, though why he could not gue&s;s, and in&s;tantly turned the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The next morning our hero went to the pawnbroker's, and, in&s;tantly di&s;covering what he was in &s;earch of, a&s;ked the man how it came in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He replied, "It was left there to be &s;old with &s;everal other things by a young lady who&s;e name he was not at liberty to mention."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">"Let me &s;ee them," cried Sir George.</P>
<P>The fellow obeyed, and produced every article of any value that had been taken from Warrington, except the necklace and ear-rings, which he &s;aid "he expected home every hour, as they were only let out to a lady to appear in at the play the evening before." Our hero then enquired their price, and found it, though far below their real value, as much beyond what he thought pro|per to be&s;tow on a worthle&s;s woman; and therefore, reque&s;ting a pen and ink, wrote the following note:</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">"Sir George Warrington will leave ten guineas with the ma&s;ter of this &s;hop, for the &s;everal articles brought from Warrington and its neighbourhood, if the owner will part with them on the&s;e terms; if not, he will apply to a ju&s;tice of the peace, and take legal mea&s;ures to re|cover them."</P>
<P>This he gave to the man, de&s;iring it might be immediately delivered to the young lady he &s;poke of, and then left the hou&s;e. On returning the next morning, he was informed the things &s;hould be all re&s;tored on his paying the promi&s;ed &s;um.
<PB N="26" REF="27">
This he complied with; and &s;eeing them properly packed up, for which he be&s;towed a farther gratuity, call|ed a hackney-coach, and conveyed them &s;afely to his uncle's hou&s;e, who &s;incerely rejoiced in his &s;uc|ce&s;s. A few days after this event, he was obliged to take an abrupt leave of his amiable relations, re|ceiving a ha&s;ty &s;ummons from Mr. Davenport, which he knew not how to refu&s;e. But he did not quit London, till he heard from Mr. Thom&s;on that the valuable packet he had &s;ent was arrived at War|rington, and the different articles it contained re&s;tored to their pro|per
<PB N="27" REF="28">
owners, nor without promi&s;ing again to vi&s;it Portman-&s;quare once more before his return to Northum|berland.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero had &s;carcely paid his fir&s;t compliments at Violet Hill, when he began to relate the various occurrences he had met with in town, &s;o eager was he to vindicate the cha|racter of Loui&s;a from &s;ome of the crimes it was charged with, as well as to defend his own penetration: "for," added he, "all &s;he told me of her previous hi&s;tory mu&s;t be true, &s;ince it has been confirmed by two per&s;ons, one of whom at lead is a woman of undoubted veracity, and
<PB N="29" REF="30">
the other could have no motive for a&s;&s;erting a fal&s;ehood."</P>
<P>To his great &s;urpri&s;e, whil&s;t relat|ing the&s;e circum&s;tances, he ob&s;erved Ro&s;etta and Fidelia look at each other in great confu&s;ion; and, when he &s;poke of his intention of vi&s;iting Mrs. Edgeworth, Fidelia replied very eagerly:&mdash;"That, Sir George, mu&s;t be deferred&mdash;Mrs. Edgeworth is not in the country."</P>
<P>"When &s;he returns, I can take an opportunity of calling on her," re|plied our hero coldly; and, turning to Mi&s;s Wilmot, &s;aw in her coun|tenance marks of &s;urpri&s;e that a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="30" REF="31">
and perplexed him; but he had no time to enter farther on the &s;ubject, as at that moment Mr. Da|venport entered, and of cour&s;e the conver&s;ation took another turn.</P>
<P>With much art that gentleman hinted to our hero the good effect his remon&s;trances would probably have on Mr. Anne&s;ley, and advi&s;ed him not to delay his application be|yond the following day, as the ma|nufacturers were all ready to attend him. Our hero replied, "he was perfectly at lei&s;ure, and would meet them in New Barn Lane, the place of rendezvous, at ten o'clock." Mr. Davenport, delighted at gaining his
<PB N="31" REF="32">
point, having feared &s;o many days re&s;idence with his ari&s;tocratic rela|tion might have occa&s;ioned a revo|lution in his &s;entiments, now took leave, promi&s;ing the men &s;hould be punctual: and our hero retired, with no other idea than that he &s;hould ri&s;e to perform a glorious and noble action, in which his own courage and abilities would be called forth for the univer&s;al good of mankind; and in this di&s;po&s;ition he met the family at breakfa&s;t. Myrtilla looked at him with a mixture of grief and pity; but the other young ladies were too much devoted to them&s;elves ever to be&s;tow a thought on him with which
<PB N="32" REF="33">
their own immediate intere&s;t was not connected.</P>
<P>At a quarter before ten his hor&s;e was brought him, and, mounting it in&s;tantly, he &s;oon reached New Barn Lane, where the men were all a&s;|&s;embled before him. They received him with three cheers; and one going before as a guide, the re&s;t followed our hero's hor&s;e; and they proceeded for two miles towards Mr. Anne&s;ley's in a regular and quiet manner, when, go|ing through a gate, they perceived at a di&s;tance three men guarding another, who&s;e hands were tied in a way that implied his villany. When they
<PB N="33" REF="34">
met, Sir George's party demanded the cau&s;e of his captivity, and were told by one of the con&s;tables, "he was a famous poacher who had been con|victed on Mr. Saville's manor, and was now going to gaol."&mdash;"What!" cried the foremo&s;t, "&s;uffer a man to go to gaol for taking a hare or a phea&s;ant! No no, we are liberty and equality men, and will re&s;cue him from your tyranny."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, they all attacked his conductors; the poacher was &s;oon relea&s;ed; who joined his friends glad|ly in tying the two con&s;tables to a tree, whil&s;t the other fellow, who
<PB N="34" REF="35">
had been witne&s;s of the fact, and was his accu&s;er, took to his heels and ran off with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>Sir George, though he felt &s;ome|thing a&s;hamed of thus heading a party who were violating the laws of their country, and would not join them in their attack, knew not how to oppo&s;e it, becau&s;e he had always con&s;idered the game-laws as too &s;trict; and indeed, &s;ince the new opinions he had taken up had per|mitted his manor to be open to every per&s;on, poor as well as rich, he only remon&s;trated on their cruelty to the con&s;tables; for he was ignorant
<PB N="35" REF="36">
that the man was a hardened villain, and an offender in many other in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>They replied, "The con&s;tables de|&s;erved much more;" and then having li&s;tened to the poacher's &s;tory, who, like the re&s;t of the world when they are their own biographers, placed his character in the mo&s;t favourable point of view, began to imagine Mr. Saville was the mo&s;t unju&s;t and cruel man in the world, and declared "they would go to his hou&s;e, and give him a le&s;&s;on before they pro|ceeded to Mr. Anne&s;ley's." Our hero objected to this: but the mul|titude prevailed; and he merely con|&s;ented
<PB N="36" REF="37">
from a hope of being able to &s;ee Mr. Saville, who was a &s;tran|ger to him, and apologize for the conduct of his attendants in relea&s;|ing the man he had committed to ju&s;tice. The poacher led the way, and, at the end of five additional miles, they arrived in &s;ight of his hou&s;e. At the entrance of a field near it, they met two &s;ervants; and, on en|quiring for their ma&s;ter, one &s;aid, "He was at home;" but the other de|nied it. Fancying the la&s;t who &s;poke had not &s;aid the truth, the men in|&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing him, and declared, "if he did not come out to them, they would enter the hou&s;e forcibly, and &s;et it on fire." The &s;ervants
<PB N="37" REF="38">
begged for God's &s;ake they would u&s;e no violence, for that their lady was lately brought to bed. The ringleader of this party replied with a brutal oath: "They cared not, and would put their threat in execution, if their ma&s;ter did not come out."</P>
<P>The &s;ervants then ran towards the hou&s;e, and &s;aid "he &s;hould come to them," but entreated they would &s;tay where they were: but this they did not choo&s;e to comply with, and moved on till they were within fifty yards of the great door, in &s;pite of Sir George, who, infinitely &s;hocked at their conduct, u&s;ed entreaties, re|mon&s;trances, threats, and bribes, in
<PB N="38" REF="39">
vain. They had all pu&s;hed before him; but he followed clo&s;e, in hopes he might at la&s;t per&s;uade them to give up the&s;e horrid mea&s;ures, and retire peaceably. To this effect he harangued them, repre&s;enting with &s;uch force the cruelty of their in|tended conduct, that five or &s;ix join|ed him, and, going on his &s;ide, de|clared "they would fight with him till the la&s;t drop of their blood was &s;hed in his &s;ervice." The re&s;t, who were more daring fellows, exa&s;perated at this, became only more de&s;perate, and &s;wore, if Mr. Saville did not ap|pear, the hou&s;e &s;hould be burnt without mercy. They were now clo&s;e by the railing that parted the
<PB N="39" REF="40">
&s;mall lawn before the door from the paddock, but, in li&s;tening and reply|ing to Sir George, had turned their backs to the gate, and appeared ra|ther as if defending it from his a&s;|&s;aults than intending to enter them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;ervants had alarmed the family. Mr. Saville was really ab&s;ent; but Mrs. Saville's brother, Captain Montague, being informed a party of villains headed by a gentleman were coming to at|tack the hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of his brother's having committed a poacher to ju&s;tice, took down his &s;word and pi&s;tols, and, accompanied
<PB N="40" REF="41">
by a dragoon &s;oldier his &s;ervant, and tho&s;e of the family, all armed as well as the &s;hort time would permit, fallied forth to repel the intruders. Ju&s;t as they were coming round a back-way, they met a country lad who on the fir&s;t alarm had been &s;ent out as a &s;py to reconnoitre, and from him learnt the party was divided, and &s;ome of them had taken his ma&s;|ter's part. This was good news, as the Captain's company was not &s;o &s;trong but they required a reinforce|ment; and &s;till pur&s;uing their fir&s;t plan, went out through the &s;tables, and met the other party in the field.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Sir George had been
<PB N="41" REF="42">
told by Mr. Davenport, as an incite|ment to his courage, that there were &s;everal gentlemen who would gladly join him, did they once know his in|tentions with re&s;pect to the general equality of mankind; and, not hav|ing ob&s;erved from whence Captain Montague came, concluded, in the confu&s;ion of his &s;pirits, that he was an auxiliary to the oppo&s;ite party; but his re&s;olution of defending the unfortunate Savilles was not damp|ed by the increa&s;e of his enemies. His countenance glowing with the ardour he felt in the real cau&s;e of humanity, his eyes &s;parkling with hone&s;t indignation, he thus addre&s;&s;ed the men who were &s;till leaning again&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="43">
the gates, pouring out threats and imprecations:</P>
<P>"I in&s;i&s;t on your oppo&s;ing me no longer; yield to me this moment, or by Heaven you &s;hall all feel the fulle&s;t weight of my re&s;entment. Depart quietly, and let me enter the gates; Mr. Saville &s;hall then know&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here he was unhappily interrupted by the Captain, who, arriving at that in&s;tant, and judging, from his &s;peech as well as his po&s;ition, he was about to make a forcible entry, &s;truck him a blow with the flat &s;ide of his hanger that almo&s;t beat him from
<PB N="43" REF="44">
his hor&s;e. The oppo&s;ite party, equal|ly mi&s;led, &s;uppo&s;ing the Captain on their &s;ide, exclaimed unanimou&s;ly, "Huzza! we have now an addition, and will conquer."</P>
<P>Sir George, recovering, exclaimed re&s;entfully, "This is not to be borne!" and then a&s;ked Captain Mon|tague, in a determined tone, what he meant by his conduct, and why he thus oppo&s;ed the cau&s;e of virtue and humanity?</P>
<P>Too much enraged to hear rea&s;on, and taking all that was &s;aid in a wrong &s;en&s;e, he replied furiou&s;ly: "Whoever you are, you are a &s;can|dal
<PB N="44" REF="45">
to the name of man; and I &s;hall an&s;wer no impertinent que&s;tions. Be a&s;&s;ured, I have good rea&s;ons for what I do, and can an&s;wer my conduct, both to my judgment and my con|&s;cience: that is more than you can do; but we wa&s;te time. I would with plea&s;ure head the&s;e hone&s;t fellows, but wi&s;h to expo&s;e the life of no in|dividual; as for my own I care not, but will gladly lay it down, if Hea|ven &s;o choo&s;e, in the defence of all mo&s;t dear to me."</P>
<P>"Come on then," cried Sir George warmly. Captain Montague gave him a pi&s;tol, and he fired without effect. The other returned the fire,
<PB N="45" REF="46">
and the ball entering his &s;ide, he fell at once to the ground apparently dead.</P>
<P>The humanity of the Captain was now much &s;hocked at the idea of having &s;o &s;uddenly deprived a fel|low creature of exi&s;tence, and that too at a moment, as he believed, when he was ra&s;hly committing crimes, the extent of which no one could judge. He ordered his man to carry him into the hou&s;e, and &s;ent in&s;tantly for a &s;urgeon. The &s;ervant obeyed; and the few adherents of Sir George &s;tood irre&s;olute, di&s;mayed, and alarmed at his fate; whil&s;t the oppo&s;ite party exultingly cried out,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
"Now we have this brave gentleman at our head, and the other is done for, we will go and &s;et the hou&s;e on fire this moment."</P>
<P>"Set the hou&s;e on fire! What hou&s;e?" exclaimed the Captain.</P>
<P>"Why, '&s;quire Saville's, to be &s;ure," cried the ringleader; "that was what we came for, but that there gentleman would not let us; but now he's gone, we will break down the gates, and have at them; &s;o come on, come on, my boys."</P>
<P>"Stay, villains," interrupted Cap|tain Montague, "and tell me what
<PB N="47" REF="48">
motive induces you to commit this act of outrage? What redre&s;s do you a&s;k? For what injury of my brother's do you &s;eek revenge?"</P>
<P>One of the men who had been con|vinced by Sir George's arguments now came forward, and, de&s;iring &s;ilence, explained the whole affair in a manner tolerably clear; placed the conduct of our hero in a right point of view, and made Captain Mon|tague under&s;tand his own fatal mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion. But he had no time to reflect on the unhappy con&s;equences; for the men became outrageous, and he was obliged to exert him&s;elf and rally his own party; when they were
<PB N="48" REF="49">
&s;uddenly relieved by the &s;ight of ano|ther at a little di&s;tance, all of whom he knew would be on his &s;ide, as they were led by the footman, who had previou&s;ly e&s;caped on the fir&s;t attack, and had rai&s;ed the inhabi|tants of a neighbouring village. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e, the villains were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, and the ring|leaders &s;eized and committed to ju&s;|tice. Captain Montague exerted him&s;elf vigorou&s;ly, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in a &s;hort time the field was cleared, many of the wretches &s;ecured, and the re&s;t ran away. Tho&s;e who had previou&s;ly repented of their intended outrage went quietly to their own homes, but not till they
<PB N="49" REF="50">
had learned that Sir George &s;hewed &s;ome &s;igns of life, though his reco|very was yet extremely doubtful.</P>
<P>Captain Montague, when his im|mediate fears for his &s;i&s;ter's family were removed, was agonized with remor&s;e and horror at the reflection of having too probably killed the man who was nobly ri&s;quing his own life for their &s;afety and defence. He enquired his name of &s;ome of the people; and, learning he was Sir George Warrington, his grief increa&s;|ed almo&s;t to phren&s;y. He flew into the hou&s;e, and, meeting the &s;ur|geon, a&s;ked his real opinion. That was little calculated to relieve his
<PB N="50" REF="51">
mind: he &s;aid "his recovery was &s;o doubtful, he thought his friends ought to be immediately informed of his &s;ituation; that the ball had in|deed happily mi&s;&s;ed his lungs; but the effu&s;ion of blood had been &s;o violent, that, though the wound in it&s;elf was not mortal, he could not an&s;wer for his recovery."</P>
<P>Di&s;tracted at this intelligence, he called for his hor&s;e, and, in&s;tantly riding over to Violet Hill, related to the family the melancholy events of the day, and the unhappy part he had taken in them, and voluntarily offered to &s;urrender him&s;elf to ju&s;tice. Mr. Wilmot was deeply &s;hocked at
<PB N="51" REF="52">
the con&s;equences of his young friend's undertaking the cau&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Davenport, which in his heart he had never approved, though he allowed its ju&s;tice; and re&s;olved im|mediately to &s;et off for Saville Hou&s;e, from whence it was impo&s;&s;ible to re|move Sir George, and judge him&s;elf of his &s;ituation. He was accompa|nied by James Bever, who was ex|tremely concerned on learning the accident that had befallen his ma&s;|ter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wilmot &s;aid, "It was a great pity &s;o fine a young man &s;hould be thus cut off in the prime of life." Ro&s;etta &s;obbed&mdash;Fidelia fainted, or
<PB N="52" REF="53">
pretended to faint&mdash;but Myrtilla felt deeply, &s;ecretly, and doubly: a thou|&s;and anxieties preyed on her mind, which &s;he dared not reveal; for &s;he had no confidante in her own family, and her favourite friend was at a di&s;|tance which precluded all communi|cation but by letter. Captain Mon|tague was too anxious for our hero to remain longer at the Hill when he had the ladies a little recovered. Myr|tilla followed him to the door, where he mounted his hor&s;e: &s;he attempted to &s;peak, but could not; and again bur&s;ting into tears, a &s;ervant appear|ing at that moment, &s;he returned to the parlour; but, di&s;gu&s;ted by her mother's in&s;en&s;ibility and her &s;i&s;ters'
<PB N="53" REF="54">
affectation, retired ha&s;tily to her own room, where &s;he indulged without re&s;traint the grief and horror that tor|mented her mind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN Montague, on his ar|rival at home, heard that Mr. Wil|mot was &s;itting by his wounded friend, who was fallen into a happy &s;lumber that promi&s;ed relief and amendment. He then went to his &s;i&s;ter's chamber, which fortunately was not in the front of the hou&s;e; and great care having been taken by her immediate attendants, &s;he knew nothing of the confu&s;ion and terror they had been in till it was wholly &s;ub&s;ided; and then was only told
<PB N="55" REF="56">
&s;uch particulars as it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould be informed of, to account for the bu&s;tle the arrival of the &s;ur|geon and the accommodating our hero had occa&s;ioned. Her brother now related &s;ome farther circum|&s;tances, and hinted a wi&s;h, though Mi&s;s Wilmot was unknown to her, that &s;he would invite her to the hou&s;e, alleging that between her and the wounded man, to whom every atten|tion was due, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a real friend&s;hip; and that con&s;equently her pre&s;ence would contribute to his comfort, and perhaps ha&s;ten his re|covery. Mrs. Saville the more rea|dily a&s;&s;ented as &s;he meant to go down &s;tairs the following day; and
<PB N="56" REF="57">
the me&s;&s;age was &s;ent by Mr. Wilmot, to whom the &s;ame compliment was paid; but he declined it. Captain Montague then re-urged his reque&s;t, and added, that Mrs. Saville, who was wholly a &s;tranger in that coun|try, having only been there a few days previous to her confinement, would be happy in that opportunity of cultivating the friend&s;hip of a fa|mily &s;o amiable and &s;o re&s;pected as that at Violet Hill.</P>
<P>Here Captain Montague for once acted like a man of the world: for the family at Violet Hill he cared nothing; but for one individual of it he felt all that a lover can feel;
<PB N="57" REF="58">
how much that is, I leave to be de|cided by the younger part of my fe|male readers. In fact, to make a my&s;tery no longer of what there is no real rea&s;on for concealing, Cap|tain Montague was the incognito ad|mirer of Myrtilla Wilmot: but, a &s;tranger to the re&s;t of her family, he had per&s;uaded his &s;i&s;ter to accept the offer made by her hu&s;band's elde&s;t brother, on his going abroad for his lady's health, to re&s;ide in their hou&s;e during their ab&s;ence, that he might form an acquaintance with them, and perhaps influence Mr. Wilmot in his favour. Mr. Edward Saville, in com|pliance with his wife's reque&s;t, con|&s;ented to take up his abode in &mdash;
<PB N="58" REF="59">
&s;hire for &s;ome months; but, being detained in town by law bu&s;ine&s;s, had been there but a few days when the poacher was committed by his orders. Captain Montague, ob|taining leave of ab&s;ence from his re|giment, had arrived only the night before; therefore had no opportunity of informing Mi&s;s Wilmot, though &s;he was previou&s;ly acquainted with his plan, and had urged her mother with unu&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s to wait on Mrs. Saville. But Mrs. Wilmot al|ways replied, "It was too far&mdash;&s;he would not take the trouble of vi&s;it|ing at &s;uch a di&s;tance;" and Myrtilla could not go without her. Of cour&s;e the invitation which Mr. Wilmot de|livered,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
and which he as well as her mother con&s;ented &s;he &s;hould accept, filled her heart with a degree of hope and joy; and the more as it had been torn by the knowledge of Sir George Warrington's danger, whom &s;he &s;in|cerely e&s;teemed, and her con&s;equent fears for her beloved Montague, who&s;e &s;afety, &s;he concluded, depend|ed on the life of our hero.</P>
<P>Mrs. Saville was prepared to e&s;teem and love her; and, on her arrival the next morning, &s;he met with the mo&s;t cordial reception from all the family but our unfortunate hero, who was yet in&s;en&s;ible to all that pa&s;&s;ed. To|wards evening, however, he revived;
<PB N="60" REF="61">
and the &s;urgeon gave more hopes of him than he had yet done. A quiet night and the unremitted attention of Captain Montague and Mr. Sa|ville, with the occa&s;ional pre&s;ence of Myrtilla, all contributed to re|&s;tore him; and in a few days he was pronounced not merely out of dan|ger, but in a fair way of recovery.</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke, who had been &s;ent for immediately on the accident, now took leave for &s;ome time, as he was obliged to attend parliament, but cho&s;e not to quit his nephew whil&s;t he remained &s;o extremely ill. Be|tween Mrs. Saville and Myrtilla a real friend&s;hip was &s;oon formed; their
<PB N="61" REF="62">
minds were &s;imilar, their hearts equal|ly excellent, and their under&s;tandings equally cultivated. Mr. Saville, who was a mo&s;t amiable man, &s;aw this with plea&s;ure, and promi&s;ed Captain Montague he would him&s;elf under|take to &s;peak for him to Mr. Wilmot, who, he doubted not, would con&s;ent to give him his daughter, as he had very good intere&s;t in his profe&s;&s;ional line&mdash;an independent, though not a large fortune&mdash;and was certain of an addition to it on the death of an old lady his great-aunt, who&s;e jointure was entailed on him. The family all united in their attentions to our hero, who was now able to &s;it up and enjoy their conver&s;ation &s;ome
<PB N="62" REF="63">
part of every day; and, as he conti|nued to mend, their little circle be|came extremely cheerful.</P>
<P>Mr. Saville and Captain Mon|tague di&s;covered, on their farther ac|quaintance, that Sir George po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed an excellent heart and a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, and wi&s;hed to remove tho&s;e prejudices, which ob&s;cured his virtues and made every good qua|lity &s;ub&s;ervient to their own purpo&s;es. To effect this, they laid in his way tho&s;e publications they thought mo&s;t proper for their plan, and ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure he read them with avidity and apparent conviction. The new&s;papers of the day were al&s;o
<PB N="63" REF="64">
con&s;tantly on his table: and learning from them, and particularly from the famous, or rather infamous, &s;peech of Du Pont, that the gene|rality of tho&s;e who betrayed their king denied their God, he was &s;eized with a horror inexpre&s;&s;ible, and, with a quickne&s;s which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed all the actions and revolu|tions of his mind, he rang the bell; and a &s;ervant entering, he de&s;ired to &s;ee Mr. Saville immediately. Mr. Saville, &s;urpri&s;ed at this ha&s;ty &s;um|mons, ran up &s;tairs, and, perceiving an unu&s;ual degree of emotion in his countenance, enquired what was the matter. Sir George, pointing to the paper, replied: "My good friend, is
<PB N="64" REF="65">
this true, or is it the trick of party? I know your candour equals your other good qualities, and can depend on your word."</P>
<P>Mr. Saville an&s;wered coolly, "It was undoubtedly true, and nothing extraordinary; &s;ince tho&s;e who could act as they had done mu&s;t expect the &s;cene to clo&s;e for ever in this world, or they would not ri&s;k the terrors of eternity in the next."</P>
<P>Sir George &s;huddered at this reply, and, a&s;king &s;till farther que&s;tions, was &s;till more &s;hocked to think he had adopted the &s;entiments and approved the conduct of athei&s;ts and infidels&mdash;
<PB N="65" REF="66">
of tho&s;e to whom murder was &s;port, and &s;acrilege glory.</P>
<P>Mr. Saville now &s;aw this was a proper time to work on his feelings; and repre&s;enting in a cool di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate manner the actions of the democrates, from the moment of their gaining an a&s;cendancy to that &s;tain|ed with the blood of their guiltle&s;s and unfortunate monarch, he pro|ceeded to inform him, "that whoever led, even in the mo&s;t di&s;tant way, towards a revolution in this now happy, becau&s;e innocent, kingdom, would be in a degree an&s;werable for all the ills that might follow. Tho&s;e, Sir George," continued he, "who
<PB N="66" REF="67">
rai&s;e a &s;pirit of di&s;content only in one man, know not how far the evil may extend, and that it may cau&s;e a ne|ver-ending calamity. As a proof: had you not been induced by the arguments of Mr. Davenport to in|fu&s;e rebellious &s;entiments into the minds of tho&s;e who followed you to this hou&s;e, they would have gone on in their old way, quietly and even happily: Mr. Anne&s;ley would not have been the object of their anger, and con&s;equently of their vengeance: and, had they not been collected in a body, I &s;hould have been &s;afe from their attacks; and but for the inter|vention of Providence, my brother's activity, and your bravery, what
<PB N="67" REF="68">
might have been the con&s;equences! My wife, my child, my property, would all have been lo&s;t!&mdash;And for what?"</P>
<P>Sir George, &s;truck with the force of his arguments, and the la&s;t in particular, wrung his hand, and with much emotion reque&s;ted his pardon.</P>
<P>"You have no pardon, Sir George, to a&s;k of me," returned Mr. Saville: "you defended me bravely and no|bly when you di&s;covered their vio|lent intentions: but you were the fir&s;t cau&s;e; and I only wi&s;h to con|vince you of the impropriety of your
<PB N="68" REF="69">
conduct." He then in a long &s;peech, which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat, as it contained only the be&s;t arguments from all tho&s;e who have &s;o ably ex|erted their talents for the good of their country, proved to him, beyond a doubt, that a revolution in this kingdom would be its de&s;truction, as it had been that of France; and that without the &s;ame plea&mdash;&s;ince, whatever trivial faults there might be in our Con&s;titution, it was, on the whole, the be&s;t calculated to promote the happine&s;s of the people in ge|neral: that equality was neither to be wi&s;hed for nor expected, in a country where every man ro&s;e by his merits, and that degree of exertion
<PB N="69" REF="70">
which gave a &s;pirit of emulation, without which, like a &s;tagnant pool, we &s;hould grow inactive and corrupt; whereas, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the kingdom, every man di&s;played the abilities nature had be&s;towed on him, to rai&s;e him to that &s;tation he was con&s;cious his merit de&s;erved."</P>
<P>When he had repeated all that occurred to him on the &s;ubject, and placed Mr. Davenport's character and conduct in its proper light, he concluded by &s;aying, "And now, Sir George, are you convinced?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, my be&s;t friend," replied our hero, "I am; and I blu&s;h at the recollection of my folly, and at the di&s;|covering
<PB N="70" REF="71">
what a dupe I have been made. The few incidents of my journey ought to have opened my eyes; and perhaps they would, had I fallen into the hands of unprejudiced people: but, led a&s;tray by the apparently amiable idea of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, charity, benevolence, and religion, I have committed the mo&s;t flagrant crimes again&s;t them all. As an act of ju&s;|tice, I have oppo&s;ed the laws of my country; as the champion of the poor, I have taken away their com|forts, by di&s;playing to their view mi&s;eries they were before unacquaint|ed with; and, in my univer&s;al philan|thropy, have headed a party of vil|lains, and in my enthu&s;ia&s;m might
<PB N="71" REF="72">
(had it not plea&s;ed Heaven to place before my view the horrors of the action) have de&s;troyed the virtuous and the innocent, whil&s;t I fancied my&s;elf taking the part of the bene|volent and humane. Though &s;trong|ly attached to the religion of my country in particular, and of cour&s;e to the Chri&s;tian religion in general, I have followed, applauded, and admired, tho&s;e who have renounced it&mdash;who&s;e crimes, who&s;e barbarity, proved they had renounced it; though till this day I knew not that they boldly triumphed in their infidelity, and gloried in denying the exi&s;tence of a power &s;uperior to their own. Mr. Davenport's conduct fills me
<PB N="72" REF="73">
with di&s;gu&s;t. I &s;ee his meanne&s;s, his duplicity, and am thankful to Hea|ven that I did not fall a victim to it; and, on a retro&s;pection of my own, I have no comfort but in re|flecting that I meant not to injure Mr. Anne&s;ley, only to remon&s;trate with him on what I then thought his inju&s;tice: and that with re&s;pect to your&s;elf, from the fir&s;t moment of the party's determining to come to your hou&s;e, I oppo&s;ed them; and, when I found oppo&s;ition vain, only agreed to attend them, from a hope of convincing you that I had taken no active part in relea&s;ing the man you had committed."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">"Say no more on this &s;ubject, I be&s;eech you, my dear Sir George," returned Mr. Saville; "I have only &s;poken for your good, and only wi&s;h for your happine&s;s." Our hero thanked him with the utmo&s;t &s;ince|rity and the entrance of the ladies; now put an end to the conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering Mr. Saville and Cap|tain Montague as his be&s;t friends, our hero intru&s;ted them with the &s;e|cret of his unfortunate attachment; nor was Mrs. Saville excluded from his confidence. That lady, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed real good &s;en&s;e and much knowledge of the world, was a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="74" REF="75">
at his relation, for he con|cealed no circum&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, "the ar|dency of your temper requires a check rather than a &s;pur; yet I mu&s;t &s;ay (though I beg you will not &s;uf|fer your&s;elf to be too much elated by it), that there is a my&s;tery in all this not ea&s;ily accounted for, and which I would advi&s;e you to deve|lop when your health is re&s;tored.

There is, Sir George, more con&s;i&s;tency in the human character than you perhaps imagine; and it is therefore very improbable that a young woman, &s;o amiable in every re&s;pect as Loui&s;a mu&s;t have been, from her own &s;tory, which was confirmed by the te&s;ti|mony of Lady M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lbanke and your &s;ervant James Bever, &s;hould all on a &s;udden, without any vi&s;ible motive, become a di&s;grace to her &s;ex: it is

<P>Sir George, delighted with this idea, willingly indulged it, and re|&s;olved to follow her advice the mo|ment it was in his power. Indeed the animation this hope gave him con|tributed greatly to his recovery; and, in a fortnight from this time, he was well enough to return to Violet Hill, where he wi&s;hed to &s;pend a few days, partly for the purpo&s;e of paying his intended vi&s;it to Mrs. Edgeworth, and partly becau&s;e he thought it a civility due to a family from whom he had received many in&s;tances of friend&s;hip, and from Mr. Wilmot

<P>OUR hero took a grateful and affectionate leave of his friends at Saville Hou&s;e, whom he promi&s;ed to revi&s;it on his return from town; and accompanied by his faithful &s;er|vant James Bever, who had paid him the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t unwearied at|tention during his confinement, ar|rived at Mr. Wilmot's.

to re&s;ign the hopes they had &s;o long cheri&s;hed. But each, fearing that in giving up her own cau&s;e &s;he might forward that of her &s;i&s;ter, formed, mutually but &s;ecretly, a plan to de&s;troy the expectations of each other: but in the mean time a vio|lent quarrel ari&s;ing, at fir&s;t, as mo&s;t quarrels do, from a mere trifle, in the height of rage and re&s;entment, they di&s;covered their &s;cheme; and, their fury increa&s;ing from this circum|&s;tance, they ran down into the par|lour, where Sir George was &s;itting with Myrtilla, who had returned the day after him to Violet Hill. Fi|delia entered fir&s;t; but pa&s;&s;ion chok|ed her utterance, and, &s;tammering
<PB N="82" REF="83">
out &s;ome invectives they could not un|der&s;tand, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, and waited to recover her breath. Ro&s;etta, who was equally enraged, but le&s;s furious, &s;oon followed, and, with that marked &s;neer which even the height of re&s;entment could not &s;uppre&s;s, &s;aid, "&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Fide|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a had been making her honourable confe&s;&s;ion of the part &s;he had taken in de&s;troying Mi&s;s Moreland's hap|pine&s;s and ruining her character."</P>
<P>Ro&s;etta was a perfect adept in every &s;pecies of irony, except that di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of humour, which is only u&s;ed in plea&s;antry; for her irony was of the bittere&s;t kind:

<L>The li&s;t'ner wonders how you thought it cold.</L></Q>
But at this moment, when her wrath was rai&s;ed to its highe&s;t pitch, her art in &s;ome degree for&s;ook her, and, in the pointed &s;arca&s;ms &s;he threw out again&s;t Fidelia, &s;he too frequently ac|cu&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The other was a vixen and a ter|magant in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, though her u&s;ual air was all

mildne&s;s; and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, in&s;tead of &s;eeking to defend her&s;elf, &s;he only thought of pouring her rage on Ro&s;etta; who, growing every mo|ment more calm, as her artifice con|quered her rage, de&s;ired the a&s;toni&s;h|ed and anxious Baronet to hold her &s;i&s;ter's hands and &s;top her mouth, and &s;he would explain what had &s;o much perplexed him. This reque&s;t he could not po&s;&s;ibly comply with; and Fidelia becoming &s;till more fu|rious, it was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty he collected the following par|ticulars from the different expre&s;&s;ions they let fall:</P>
<P>That on making their charitable

and benevolent vi&s;it to Mrs. Edge|worth to prevent her being any longer impo&s;ed upon, they learnt, to their utter di&s;may, that Loui&s;a had been with her from the time, as near as they could gue&s;s, of her parting with Sir George: that, as this cir|cum&s;tance would have defeated all their views, they &s;aid nothing of the period, but only mentioned the events that had pa&s;&s;ed at Warrington, which they declared Sir George would cor|roborate: but wi&s;hing to prevent their meeting, le&s;t an eclairci&s;&s;ement &s;hould en&s;ue, they hinted that Sir George was always affected by the &s;ubject, and avoided it as much as po&s;&s;ible: they were therefore con|vinced
<PB N="86" REF="87">
in their own minds, that, as this was undoubtedly the real Mi&s;s Moreland, &s;he who had been at Mr. Thom&s;on's was certainly an impo&s;|tor. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of their information; but each accu&s;ed the other of framing and executing the artifice; alleging, &s;he only con&s;ent|ed from a fear of expo&s;ing her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Sir George was too much &s;hocked and concerned to attempt a reply; but, darting on them looks of mingled horror and contempt, he &s;eized Myr|tilla's hand, exclaiming, "Forgive me, dear Mi&s;s Wilmot, for taking this abrupt leave of you; but I can &s;tay no longer here, le&s;t I &s;hould fail

He &s;topped an in&s;tant in confu&s;ion, and then conti|nued: "I &s;hall &s;ee or hear of you at Saville Hou&s;e; in the mean time I will write to your father, apologize for my pre&s;ent conduct, and not for|get my promi&s;e to you." Then ha&s;|tily &s;haking her hand, he bade her once more farewell, and left the room.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for his &s;ervant, and, order|ing his hor&s;e immediately, bade James follow him with his baggage to the Star in the county town; and then rode off in&s;tantly, and &s;oon arrived at Mr. Edgeworth's. On enquiring for his la|dy, he was &s;hewn into a parlour, where
<PB N="88" REF="89">
he had &s;carcely time to recover from his agitation before &s;he appeared. After informing her of his name, and apologizing for his intru&s;ion&mdash;"Will you, Madam," &s;aid he, "allow me to a&s;k you a few que&s;tions re&s;pecting the Mi&s;s Moreland &s;o lately a re&s;i|dent in your family?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, Sir," replied the lady; "as many as you plea&s;e; though, believe me, I was &s;orry to find you and I had both been deceived in her."</P>
<P>"There was &s;ome mi&s;take in all that, Madam," cried our hero, "which I wi&s;h to rectify."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">"If the explanation," returned Mrs. Edgeworth, "is in her favour, I &s;hall mo&s;t truly rejoice to hear it; for never was there a more prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing young woman than Loui&s;a, and I was &s;incerely attached to her till I heard, from &s;uch undoubted au|thority, &s;he was &s;o completely un|worthy."</P>
<P>Our hero's eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure. "Will you, Madam," &s;aid he, "only tell me at what time and at what place you fir&s;t &s;aw her? I will then give you my rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>"I was," replied &s;he, "returning from &mdash;&s;hire with my two elde&s;t

daughters, whither we had accom|panied their late governe&s;s, who was married to a clergyman; and &s;top|ping at &mdash; to change hor&s;es, the woman of the hou&s;e came out, and entreated, as it was growing late, that I would proceed no farther that night, as there were highwaymen in the neighbourhood. This terrified the children &s;o completely, that for their &s;akes, though I was not afraid my&s;elf, I would not go on, but alighted in&s;tantly, and ordering tea, the landlady her&s;elf brought it in: and I then enquired what grounds &s;he had for her &s;u&s;picion. She re|plied, 'A young lady came to her hou&s;e a few hours before, who had

<P>"Struck with horror and compa&s;|&s;ion at this account, I begged to &s;ee the young lady; and &s;he in&s;tantly admitted me. As &s;he was now more calm, I learnt that, having lo&s;t her father abroad, &s;he came from France to &s;tay with a woman who had taken care of her in her infancy; but that

finding her and her hu&s;band both dead, &s;he was on the point of di&s;|traction, when a gentleman, hearing her di&s;tre&s;s, had given her a bank|note, and a letter of recommendation to a friend of his to take care of her till &s;he could form &s;ome plan for her future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The&s;e were in|clo&s;ed in his pocket book, which, for greater &s;afety, &s;he placed in her trunk, which was in the carriage then waiting for her; con&s;equently had only once read the direction, no trace of which now remained on her mind, which &s;he imagined was owing to her being unaccu&s;tomed to Eng|li&s;h names; and that of her generous benefactor &s;he was ignorant of. That
<PB N="93" REF="94">
about half way between the place &s;he left and that &s;he was now in, a high|wayman &s;topped the carriage: &s;he gave him all that was in her pocket; but, that being only a few &s;hillings, he was not &s;atisfied, but in&s;i&s;ted on her opening the trunk, and from thence took the pocket-book and all its contents, leaving her in a &s;tate of mind more ea&s;ily imagined than de|&s;cribed. She added, &s;he was now to|tally without friends in this country, or any other; and that &s;he had but one relation in the world&mdash;this was a half &s;i&s;ter of her father's, whom &s;he had never &s;een &s;ince her infancy; and as her father, from &s;ome family quarrel, had kept up no corre&s;pondence with
<PB N="94" REF="95">
her, &s;he knew not where to find her, and was totally ignorant of every circum|&s;tance relative to her, except that her maiden name was Moreland. She con|cluded her little narrative, every word of which I gave implicit credit to, with an agonizing bur&s;t of tears. Much hurt at her di&s;tre&s;s, and fearing the con|&s;equences of &s;o forlorn a &s;ituation to &s;uch youth and beauty, I offered her an a&s;ylum with me for the pre&s;ent. She joyfully accepted it, and the next morning arrived at home. In a very &s;hort time I di&s;covered that &s;he &s;poke the French and Italian languages with the utmo&s;t propriety, and was a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of painting, and every kind of fine work. This gave
<PB N="95" REF="96">
me more &s;atisfaction, as I really be|gan to have an affection for her, and it was now in my power to &s;ecure her a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment as a go|verne&s;s to my girls. She gladly un|dertook the ta&s;k, and I every day found greater rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her conduct, and their progre&s;s in all the branches of education &s;he undertook to teach them; till the vi&s;it of the Mi&s;s Wilmots obliged me to part with her. They a&s;ked me the &s;ame que&s;tions you have done, and I made them the &s;ame replies: they then a&s;&s;ured me, that of the fir&s;t part of her &s;tory they knew nothing, but believed it was as fal&s;e as the re&s;t; &s;ince you were the gentleman
<PB N="96" REF="97">
who had given her the letter and mo|ney; but that in&s;tead of lo&s;ing it, as &s;he had a&s;&s;erted, &s;he had been at Warrington, where her conduct was &s;o notoriou&s;ly bad as to render her liable to a pro&s;ecution: that &s;he bor|rowed ornaments of the ladies to whom your letter had recommended her, and had taken them away, to|gether with plate and money to a con&s;iderable amount from the fa|mily &s;he re&s;ided with. On hearing this, I would have que&s;tioned her; but Mr. Edgeworth, who&s;e temper is a little warm, in&s;i&s;ted on her leaving the hou&s;e directly, and would not let me &s;ee her, le&s;t, as he &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould farther impo&s;e upon me. He went
<PB N="97" REF="98">
up to her him&s;elf, and, without en|tering into particulars, only &s;aid '&s;he mu&s;t quit us in&s;tantly, and the &s;ooner &s;he went the better, as the gentleman who had &s;een her at church meant to pro&s;ecute her for a robbery, wherever he found her.' Terrified at this, &s;he began to excu&s;e her&s;elf: but Mr. Edgeworth refu&s;ed to li&s;ten; and, or|dering the carriage, he &s;ent her off in le&s;s than an hour, and we have heard nothing of her &s;ince."</P>
<P>Sir George then, with much emo|tion, begged to know exactly the day of their meeting; and, learning it, knew it to be that on which he had parted from her at &mdash;; con|&s;equently
<PB N="98" REF="99">
her innocence was evident. Cla&s;ping his hands together in an agony of grief and remor&s;e, he ex|claimed, "Ju&s;t Heaven! what is become of the lovely, the injured Loui&s;a?"</P>
<P>He then explained the whole af|fair to Mrs. Edgeworth, who li&s;|tened with a&s;toni&s;hment and plea|&s;ure, mingled with a proper degree of contempt for Ro&s;etta's and Fide|lia's ba&s;ene&s;s; "who," &s;he &s;aid, "mu&s;t be them&s;elves aware that the time did not agree, as they had told her it was many weeks &s;ince the af|fair had happened at Warrington, when they mu&s;t be con&s;cious it was
<PB N="99" REF="100">
during that period when Mi&s;s More|land was re&s;ident under her roof. It will, however, Sir George," conti|nued &s;he, "be a le&s;&s;on to me in fu|ture to take nothing upon tru&s;t, but examine the truth of an accu&s;ation before I pretend to decide."</P>
<P>Sir George agreed with her as to the propriety of this; and then, con|vinced he had no chance of gaining any farther intelligence of his beloved Loui&s;a in this part of the country, determined to &s;et out in&s;tantly for London, and trace the wretch who had robbed her and then a&s;&s;umed her name. Yet knowing it was too late to begin his journey that after|noon,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
he refu&s;ed not Mrs. Edge|worth's invitation to dinner, and was fully repaid, by hearing the &s;in|cere te&s;timony both that lady and her children paid to her merits. The little girls expre&s;&s;ed their concern for her lo&s;s, and declared unanimou&s;ly, "though &s;he was always melancholy, &s;he was never out of temper;" whil&s;t Mrs. Edgeworth &s;poke of her talents, her under&s;tanding, and principles, in terms of the highe&s;t and warme&s;t prai&s;e. Mr. Edgeworth was ab&s;ent on a vi&s;it: a circum&s;tance our hero by no means regretted, &s;ince he would have found it difficult to be cordial to one, the warmth of who&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tion had led him into an error that
<PB N="101" REF="102">
had cau&s;ed Sir George &s;o much mi|&s;ery. In the evening he returned to his inn; and writing a few lines to Mr. Wilmot to apologize for leaving his hou&s;e &s;o abruptly, and a letter to Mr. Thom&s;on, giving him a conci&s;e account of the important di&s;covery, went to bed with a mind torn by a thou&s;and contending emotions, deter|mining, the next morning as &s;oon as it was light, to &s;et out on his return to London.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I relate the events of our hero's journey to town, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give my readers a clear account of all that happened to the unfortunate Loui&s;a from the period of her parting with Sir George; who had not mentioned to her his name, from the de&s;ire he then felt of concealing his title from the world. This he cho&s;e not to explain to her, and therefore was &s;ilent on the &s;ub|ject; knowing, on her arrival at the vicarage, his plan would be di&s;co|vered,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
if he had announced him&s;elf only as Mr. Warrington; and had he at once declared him&s;elf to be Sir George, the people of the inn could not be ignorant of what he wi&s;hed to keep &s;ecret; &s;imply forgetting the addre&s;s on his letters from Mr. Thom&s;on would at all events fru&s;|trate his plan.</P>
<P>All the circum&s;tances Mi&s;s More|land had related to Mrs. Edgeworth were exactly true; but it is not ea&s;y to give a ju&s;t idea of the tran&s;port &s;he felt, when that lady offered her an a&s;ylum, and &s;he found it po&s;&s;ible to be u&s;eful to her in the quality of governe&s;s: her tranquillity returned,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
and her happine&s;s increa&s;ed every hour, as &s;he every hour grew more attached to Mrs. Edgeworth and her amiable daughters. Of Mr. Edge|worth &s;he &s;aw little but at meals: he was a mere &s;port&s;man, rough in his manners, and unfeeling almo&s;t to brutality: his behaviour to his wife and family was &s;ufficient to give her a di&s;gu&s;t to him, though to her, till the interview preceding their &s;epara|tion, he had always behaved with as much civility as he was capable of. Nothing interrupted the calm &s;erenity of her life but a wi&s;h to know the name and addre&s;s of her generous benefactor, that &s;he might again expre&s;s the gratitude &s;he felt,
<PB N="105" REF="106">
and inform him of the true rea&s;on why &s;he had not availed her&s;elf of his benevolent offer, fearing, too ju&s;t|ly, he might accu&s;e her of having acted with duplicity. Without be|ing guilty of the weakne&s;s of falling in love at fir&s;t &s;ight, he had made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on her heart: &s;he &s;till retained his image in her mind, and, by comparing it with the gentle|men who vi&s;ited at Mr. Edgeworth's, it &s;oon acquired an ideal &s;uperiority; for of his real character &s;he could only know he was benevolent and humane, and this his conduct to|wards her had fully proved.</P>
<P>The joy &s;he felt on meeting him
<PB N="106" REF="107">
at church was mingled with embar|ra&s;&s;ment, from her &s;carcely know|ing how to begin her ju&s;tification; and this gave her an appearance of guilt, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which &s;he was far from feeling: but the in&s;o|lent &s;peech of Fidelia overthrew the little courage &s;he had been &s;truggling to obtain; and, before &s;he could re|cover, they had both left the church. Apprehen&s;ion, though &s;he knew not of what&mdash;di&s;appointment, and mor|tification, now completely &s;ubdued her; and, as the Mi&s;s Edgeworths had declared, when called on for their evidence, they could &s;carcely keep her from fainting during their ride home; and, arriving there, &s;he reach|ed
<PB N="107" REF="108">
her chamber with difficulty. Ca|roline Edgeworth, who loved her ten|derly, gave her &s;ome drops, and &s;taid with her till &s;ummoned to the par|lour, whither &s;he went with the le&s;s reluctance as Mi&s;s Moreland was con&s;iderably better. But this amend|ment la&s;ted not long: Mr. Edge|worth in a few minutes entered her apartment, and, in a voice choked with rage, bade her leave his hou&s;e, accu&s;ing her alternately of theft and impo&s;ture. It was in vain &s;he de|clared her innocence, and begged to know who had vilified her. He re|plied &s;ullenly, "It was no matter; but that thus far he would tell her&mdash; the gentleman &s;he had &s;een at
<PB N="108" REF="109">
church would &s;wear before any ma|gi&s;trate in the kingdom, that &s;he had robbed him of plate, money, and jewels, to a con&s;iderable amount; &s;o &s;he had be&s;t get off as fa&s;t as &s;he could, for he would pro&s;ecute her wherever he found her."</P>
<P>"For Heaven's &s;ake!" exclaimed the di&s;tracted Loui&s;a, "tell me his name, that I may apply to him in per&s;on, and ju&s;tify my&s;elf; for in|deed, indeed, I am innocent; there is &s;ome terrible mi&s;take in all this."</P>
<P>"No no," cried Mr. Edgeworth, "there is no mi&s;take; he &s;aw you him&s;elf, and could not &s;ay his pray|ers
<PB N="109" REF="110">
for thinking about it. As to his name, that's all a fetch&mdash;you know it as well as I do&mdash;&s;o pack up your things and be off, d'ye hear, within this hour, or the con&s;tables will be after you. The carriage &s;hall take you to &mdash;, and that's more than you de&s;erve; but you had as good not &s;tay there, I can tell you."</P>
<P>He then left the room, di&s;regard|ing her tears, and her entreaties that he would li&s;ten to her if but for a mo|ment. The agony &s;he was in for &s;ome time prevented her from taking any &s;teps towards her removal; but terror at length overcame every other &s;en&s;ation, and &s;he collected her little
<PB N="110" REF="111">
wardrobe. Whil&s;t locking her trunk, &s;he heard the carriage drive to the door; and at that moment Caroline, entering the room on tiptoe as if afraid of being overheard, ran up to her, and, embracing her affectionate|ly, gave her a paper.&mdash;"Mamma &s;ends you this," cried &s;he; "&s;he mu&s;t not come her&s;elf, but &s;he wi&s;hes you well, and hopes you are inno|cent; and, if not, that you will never be guilty again. I do not very well know what is the matter; but I am &s;ure I am &s;orry to part with you."</P>
<P>"God ble&s;s you, my dear Caro|line!" replied Loui&s;a in broken ac|cents. "Indeed I am guilty of no
<PB N="111" REF="112">
crime, nor can I gue&s;s what I am ac|cu&s;ed of."</P>
<P>The footman now entered for her trunks, and Caroline, once more em|bracing her, left the room &s;obbing violently; and Loui&s;a, with extreme agitation, followed the &s;ervant down &s;tairs, and, entering the carriage, in a &s;hort time arrived at the inn; but, fearful of remaining, ordered a po&s;t|chai&s;e, and in the mean time &s;at down to con&s;ider whither &s;he &s;hould go, and what method &s;he could take to avoid falling into the hands of her cruel per&s;ecutor&mdash;for &s;uch &s;he now too ju&s;tly e&s;teemed our hero. On opening the paper given her by Ca|roline,

&s;he found it contained a twenty pound note; and this re|moving &s;ome of her fears, by &s;up|plying her with pre&s;ent &s;upport, &s;he returned her warme&s;t thanks to Hea|ven for not abandoning her in this hour of di&s;tre&s;s, and then mental|ly acknowledged Mrs. Edgeworth's kindne&s;s; and as &s;he had &s;everal guineas already in her pocket, ap|prehen&s;ive of a misfortune &s;imilar to that &s;he had before experienced, &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of the note and three gui|neas in a way not likely to be di&s;|covered, by fa&s;tening them within the lining of her beaver hat: and then, believing &s;he &s;tood more in need of countenance and protection than

even on her fir&s;t arrival in England, it occurred to her to go to the farm formerly occupied by her old nur&s;e, and enquire whether &s;he had any re|lations now living, as their recom|mendation might be u&s;eful to her, and &s;he &s;hould probably want no|thing el&s;e. Unlocking her box, &s;he took out a parcel of Mrs. Garland's letters, to identify her if required, and re&s;olved, when once made known to them, to change her name, that &s;he might be concealed from the know|ledge of our hero. Having &s;ettled this, her mind grew ea&s;ier; and, when the chai&s;e was ready, &s;he or|dered it to the next &s;tage towards the northern road. But, on her arrival,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
&s;he grew &s;o extremely ill as to be wholly unable to continue her jour|ney; the agitation of her mind throw|ing her into a fever, which la&s;ted her &s;everal days: towards the latter end of the week &s;he recovered, and, pur|&s;uing her fir&s;t plan, about four o'clock on the Friday afternoon reached the place of her de&s;tination, having taken the name of We&s;tern, and affixed the &s;ame direction on her portmanteau.</P>
<P>She would not &s;top at the little inn where &s;he had before met our hero: it revived too many painful recollections; but, ordering the man to drive to the end of the &s;treet neare&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="116">
the farm, &s;he alighted, and, bidding him wait, walked through a meadow to the hou&s;e. In her way &s;he met a labourer, and enquiring the farmer's name, he &s;aid it was John&s;on: &s;he then a&s;ked if he was at home, and was an&s;wered in the affirmative. On this &s;he walked on, and, repeating her que&s;tion, was &s;hewn by a girl into a very decent parlour, where the fir&s;t object that &s;truck her eyes was a piece of her own needle-work, framed and glazed, hanging over the chim|ney, which &s;he had &s;ent her nur&s;e when a girl about twelve years old. The recollection drew tears into her eyes, and, when the farmer entered, &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">With a ru&s;tic bow he enquired her commands, and &s;he replied, by a&s;king if he had had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farm ever &s;ince the death of the for|mer tenant.</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam," an&s;wered he.</P>
<P>"Then perhaps you can inform me, whether farmer Garland or his wife left any near relations, and where they at pre&s;ent re&s;ide."</P>
<P>"She was my &s;i&s;ter, Madam," re|turned he; "but, excepting my&s;elf and a cou&s;in or two, &s;he left no kin|dred at all."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a now believed &s;he traced a
<PB N="117" REF="118">
di&s;tant re&s;emblance; and, her tears &s;till flowing&mdash;"Did you never," &s;aid &s;he, "hear her &s;peak of a little girl &s;he &s;uckled, Loui&s;a Moreland?"</P>
<P>"Ay," cried he, "many a time and oft: 'twas &s;he that worked that fine picture yonder, and poor Mary u&s;ed to grieve &s;o about her in her la&s;t illne&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he had heard nothing of her for a long time, and &s;aid &s;he was among outlandi&s;h people and pa|pi&s;hes; for Mary loved her like her own child."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Moreland, quite &s;ubdued by this in&s;tance of tenderne&s;s, replied in a faltering voice&mdash;"I am that
<PB N="118" REF="119">
Loui&s;a; the&s;e letters (taking them from her pocket) will prove to you I am no impo&s;tor: that picture, as you &s;ay, was worked by my own hand; my name and age are at the back, with the date of the year."</P>
<P>"So it is, indeed," cried the far|mer in much &s;urpri&s;e; "you are young Madam Moreland, to be &s;ure; but what, Mi&s;s, did you not know our Mary and her hu&s;band were dead?"</P>
<P>"Oh yes," returned &s;he weeping, "I knew it too well; I learnt it &s;ome time &s;ince; and now you &s;hall hear my bu&s;ine&s;s with you. I am in great
<PB N="119" REF="120">

If you have a wife and fa|mily, let me board with you for a &s;hort time, till I can form &s;ome plan for my future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: perhaps even in that re&s;pect you can a&s;&s;i&s;t me, by recommending me to a place where I may gain a decent living. I a&s;k only your protection."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, impatiently expecting his reply: he was &s;ilent for &s;ome mi|nutes: at la&s;t, "I am very &s;orry, Mi&s;s," &s;aid he, "for your misfor|tunes,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
and wi&s;h I was able to do as you would have me; but, to tell you the truth, the grey mare is the better hor&s;e here, and my wife won't ap|prove of your living with us, and that: be&s;ides, we have no gentry here|about, where you could go to &s;er|vice; being as they're all &s;ingle men, as comes down once or twice a year a-hunting and &s;hooting and the like, with their fine Mi&s;&s;es and Madams: but now I think on't, you ben't &s;o friendle&s;s as you do believe; for 'twas but la&s;t Tue&s;day night a gentleman's &s;arvent was enquiring for you; and when I &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter as nur&s;ed you was dead, and that you had never been here, the footman &s;aid, 'his

<P>Loui&s;a trembled. "Will that mercile&s;s man," exclaimed &s;he, "ne|ver cea&s;e to per&s;ecute me! Tell me, my good friend, who&s;e &s;ervant it was?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Mi&s;s, I never thought to ax, not expecting to &s;ee you here; but never fear&mdash;he'll come again, I warrant him &mdash;for he &s;aid his ma&s;ter would never re&s;t till he had found you."</P>

I go for &s;afety and protection! &mdash; for here I mu&s;t not &s;tay, even if they would permit me."</P>
<P>The good farmer was much moved by her di&s;tre&s;s, though believing it only aro&s;e from his refu&s;ing her an a&s;ylum. "I'll tell you what I can do, Mi&s;s," &s;aid he; "you &s;hall bide here for a fortnight; and then I'm a-go|ing farther down the country a good way to arre&s;t a man that owes me for a matter of fifty head of oxen: now I &s;hall not be far from a cou&s;in of mine and poor Mary's, that lives in a very &s;ober family as hou&s;ekeeper: now I'll take you to her behind me, if &s;o be as you can ride double; and

<P>Loui&s;a joyfully accepted an offer in many re&s;pects &s;o eligible, and which would, as &s;he hoped, convey her far from tho&s;e &s;he had mo&s;t rea|&s;on to fear; and was received by Mrs. John&s;on with tolerable civility. The farmer him&s;elf, at her reque&s;t, undertook to di&s;charge the chai&s;e and take care of her trunks. She pa&s;&s;ed the fortnight with more tranquillity than &s;he expected, though not with|out many fears that the footman farmer John&s;on had &s;poken of would return; and on the appointed day,

tying up a few nece&s;&s;aries in a bundle, and equipping her&s;elf as properly as &s;he could for her new expedition, &s;he &s;et out behind the farmer, leaving her clothes to be forwarded if her appli|cation &s;ucceeded. Here then for a while let us leave Loui&s;a and return to our hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Sir George aro&s;e in the morning, it occurred to him that James Bever, being well acquainted with the per&s;on of Loui&s;a, might be employed in &s;earching for her dur|ing his &s;tay in town; and now, for the fir&s;t time, imparted to him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, lamented his own credulity, and execrated the ba&s;ene&s;s of the younger Wilmots, yet cau|tioned him again&s;t mentioning their names. James heard him with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, and, forgetting
<PB N="126" REF="127">
his ma&s;ter had only &s;een her for a few hours, wondered he could po&s;&s;ibly believe &s;he was guilty of &s;uch de|praved conduct; but he &s;aw how deeply he &s;uffered already, and avoid|ed &s;aying any thing that might add to his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hope of Sir George was to trace her through the means of the po&s;tillion who had driven her from the inn he was now at, as Mrs. Edgeworth, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his enquiries, had informed him her carriage had conveyed her there; but this hope was vain. The landlord recollected the circum&s;tance in&s;tantly, but &s;aid "the man had &s;ince left his &s;ervice, and
<PB N="127" REF="128">
was gone he knew not whither." All that could now be done was to enquire at the next &s;tage every way. This was a work of time: James Bever, however, gladly undertook it, hoping to re&s;tore the amiable Loui&s;a; and, promi&s;ing to write to our hero at Lord Milbanke's if any fortunate event occurred, he &s;et out at the &s;ame moment that our hero got into the carriage that was to convey him to London.</P>
<P>He proceeded in&s;tantly to Lord Milbanke's, and, fortunately finding them without company, related every occurrence re&s;pecting Mi&s;s More|land that had come to his know|ledge;
<PB N="128" REF="129">
candidly confe&s;&s;ing the part he had acted, at the &s;ame time excu&s;|ing him&s;elf by &s;hewing the letter of Mr. Thom&s;on, which, as he knew not of the robbery, was a te&s;timony not to be doubted. The affliction of Lady Milbanke was evident and &s;in|cere; and his Lord&s;hip, though he had not the &s;ame rea&s;on, was deeply concerned at the relation, and the dread of what Loui&s;a's &s;ufferings might be in future, forlorn and un|protected as &s;he was. He promi&s;ed our hero to join him in every exertion for her re&s;toration, and hoped much from James Bever, who was not only a well-principled diligent fellow, but particularly anxious for the fate of
<PB N="129" REF="130">
Mi&s;s Moreland, from having once been in&s;trumental to her pre&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>The following morning, the gen|tlemen &s;et out on the expedition in which, next to regaining Loui&s;a, they were mo&s;t intere&s;ted. This was to &s;olve the apparent enigma of the rob|bery; and for this purpo&s;e they went to the pawnbroker's, and, threatening him with a pro&s;ecution for receiv|ing &s;tolen goods if he did not con|fe&s;s from whom he had tho&s;e articles he formerly re&s;igned to our hero, he in&s;tantly complied; and giving them a direction to Kitty Harris in the Seven Dials, they went immediately
<PB N="130" REF="131">
in &s;earch of her. On arriving at the hou&s;e, they were &s;ent up &s;tairs by a woman in the &s;hop; and, entering a mi&s;erable apartment, found the ob|ject of their enquiry the victim of &s;ickne&s;s and poverty, and &s;o &s;itu|ated as in their humane hearts pre|cluded all idea of revenge. On their opening the door, &s;he lifted up her languid head, and, in a voice &s;carcely audible, demanded their bu&s;ine&s;s. Our hero was too much &s;hocked to reply; but Lord Milbanke, who&s;e longer acquaintance with the world had rendered the&s;e &s;cenes le&s;s &s;trange to him, a&s;ked "if &s;he was the young woman who at Warrington had taken the name of Moreland?" She looked
<PB N="131" REF="132">
terrified at this que&s;tion; which our hero perceiving, told her, in a mild accent, "&s;he had nothing to fear; they only begged &s;he would relate all &s;he knew of the circum&s;tance he al|luded to." With &s;till greater con|fu&s;ion &s;he promi&s;ed to comply; but her voice failed through mere weak|ne&s;s, and &s;he then a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had not ta&s;ted food that day. On hearing this, Lord Milbanke, fearing &s;he would not be able to go through with the &s;tory, ran down &s;tairs, and di&s;patched a boy from the &s;hop to the next tavern for a bottle of wine and a cold chicken. When he returned, &s;he took a little of the latter, and drank a gla&s;s of wine, and, appear|ing
<PB N="132" REF="133">
much revived, in&s;tantly began her narrative; but, as we are better acquainted with &s;ome of the facts than &s;he was her&s;elf, we beg leave to give it in our own words.</P>
<P>Kitty Harris was the daughter of an inferior trade&s;man in the Bo|rough; but the ambition of her fa|ther and the vanity of her mother inducing them to &s;end her to a more eminent &s;chool than &s;he had any right to be educated at, &s;he imbibed higher ideas, and cheri&s;hed higher hopes, than &s;he had any pro&s;pect of gratifying, though in per&s;on &s;he was really pretty and rather genteel. Her parents, on her return, &s;aw their
<PB N="133" REF="134">
error, but knew not how to remedy it. Kitty now wanted finer clothes than they had any means of &s;upply|ing her with, and langui&s;hed for amu&s;ements &s;he was far removed from. When they wanted her to &s;tand behind the counter, &s;he &s;ullenly refu&s;ed; and, when they threatened her with puni&s;hment, replied, "&s;he would run away from them;" but of this they had no fear, well a&s;&s;ured &s;he had no where to run to. But this was not the ca&s;e long. To obtain finery was now her &s;ole object; and, to en|able her to purcha&s;e it, &s;he made no &s;cruple of robbing her father's till from time to time of &s;uch &s;mall &s;ums as might not be mi&s;&s;ed. This led
<PB N="134" REF="135">
her to &s;till greater crimes, as it en|abled her to dre&s;s, and afford the expence of public places; and a com|panion was only wanting; for &s;he well knew her father and mother would not let her go alone. With|out much difficulty &s;he made a friend|&s;hip with a young woman who lodg|ed in the &s;ame &s;treet, who&s;e nominal profe&s;&s;ion was a mantua-maker. With her &s;he pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time, and with her went to the plays, and &s;uch places as her pocket would af|ford; and at them increa&s;ed her ac|quaintance con&s;iderably. The gra|dations of vice are at fir&s;t &s;carcely perceptible; but its con&s;equences are dreadful and certain. Kitty Harris
<PB N="135" REF="136">
&s;oon formed a connection with a young apprentice; and influenced by the example of her companion, the regularity of her father's hou&s;e be|came irk&s;ome, and &s;he con&s;ented to elope with him. He placed her in a &s;mall lodging in Oxford-&s;treet; and, thus far removed, there was little probability of her parents tracing her; and for &s;ome time &s;he lived in comparative affluence. But this &s;oon ended: the young man was recalled to the country by his friends; and taking a French leave of Kitty, &s;he was deeply involved in di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, a&s;hamed to return to her abandoned home, yet afraid of the horrors of a pri&s;on, as the mi&s;tre&s;s of
<PB N="136" REF="137">
the hou&s;e threatened to arre&s;t her for the rent. This, however, &s;he e&s;|caped; and, meeting with another pro|tector, who was journeyman in a ca|pital warehou&s;e, was again lifted to a &s;ituation &s;imilar to that &s;he had been in before. But whether in poverty or affluence, the native depravity of her principles never &s;uffered her to be inactive; and &s;he was only guilty of petty thefts, becau&s;e, though her genius led her to higher crimes, for|tune had not yet given her an oppor|tunity to exert it.</P>
<P>It happened, as it u&s;ually does happen, that her keeper, unable ho|ne&s;tly to &s;upport the expence of a
<PB N="137" REF="138">
mi&s;tre&s;s and a couple of hor&s;es, took the liberty of applying to his ma&s;ter's till; and this being at length &s;u&s;pect|ed, he was di&s;carded with ignominy. But as no po&s;itive proof appeared, he for this time e&s;caped the puni&s;h|ment he merited; and, being deprived of all other means of &s;upport, took to the highway, where he gained a precarious livelihood; but, fearing a di&s;covery if he con&s;tantly frequented the &s;ame places, he &s;et out with two or three more on a country expedi|tion. They picked up among them a capital &s;um, and, then di&s;per&s;ing, took different roads to London.</P>
<P>This young man, after riding all
<PB N="138" REF="139">
night, came in about &s;ix in the morn|ing to the little public-hou&s;e where our hero met Mi&s;s Moreland; and waiting till his hor&s;e was re&s;ted and he had taken &s;ome breakfa&s;t, being too far removed from the &s;cene of his depredations even to fear &s;u&s;picion, he overheard the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between them, and witne&s;&s;ed (for the door was a-jar) the gift of the pocket-book, and learnt its contents. A capital prize was now in view, and he determined it &s;hould not e&s;cape him. He called for his hor&s;e, and, waiting to hear which way the car|riage was ordered, &s;et out &s;oon after, and, purpo&s;ely riding &s;low, would not overtake it till he had reached a &s;pot
<PB N="139" REF="140">
conveniently lonely for his purpo&s;e. The robbery was effected without any trouble, for the terrified Loui&s;a yielded it up without remon&s;trance; and he rode off highly &s;atisfied with his expedition.</P>
<P>On his arrival at London, which was not immediately, as he &s;taid &s;ome little time on the road, he flew to Kitty's lodgings, related all his &s;uc|ce&s;s, flung a few guineas into her lap, and, opening the pocket-book, took out the bank-note and &s;ecured it; broke the &s;eal of the letter, and, finding it contained nothing of value, threw it on the fire; but the pocket|book it&s;elf, which was very hand|&s;ome,
<PB N="140" REF="141">
having a gold lock and &s;ilver in&s;truments, he al&s;o pre&s;ented to Kitty; and, then ri&s;ing, &s;aid 'he mu&s;t meet his old friends at the u&s;ual place, as he had promi&s;ed.'</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of woman never &s;leeps. When he was gone, &s;he took the letter from the fire, which for|tunately was almo&s;t out, and it had received no injury except a little du&s;t, and began peru&s;ing it. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, the po&s;&s;ibility of per|&s;onating Mi&s;s Moreland occurred to her; and &s;he determined to attempt it, allured by the hopes of gain, as the injunction to Mr. Thom&s;on to &s;upply Loui&s;a with any &s;ums &s;he
<PB N="141" REF="142">
might require induced her to believe it might be a profitable journey; and the intended ab&s;ence of Sir George afforded her a &s;ufficient time to com|plete her plans. On looking at the date, &s;he &s;aw only a few days had elap&s;ed, and re&s;olved in&s;tantly to put her &s;cheme in execution, and that without &s;aying a word to any one. The next morning, therefore, leav|ing a me&s;&s;age with her landlady that &s;he was gone into the country for a day or two, &s;he &s;et out in one of the northern coaches, and arrived at Mr. Thom&s;on's in &s;afety, giving him as a rea&s;on for not being there accord|ing to the date of the letter, that
<PB N="142" REF="143">
&s;he had been detained on the road by illne&s;s, which had con&s;umed the lit|tle pittance be&s;towed by Sir George.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Thom&s;on gave implicit belief to this account, ex|erted them&s;elves for her comfort and accommodation, and introduced her to all the friends of Sir George, by whom &s;he was received with particu|lar civility, though not with particu|lar &s;atisfaction. Mi&s;s Kettering, hav|ing lo&s;t all hopes of the Baronet, at|tached her&s;elf to the pretended Lou|i&s;a, wi&s;hing to form a la&s;ting inti|macy; &s;ince, next to being Lady Warrington her&s;elf, to be Lady War|rington's
<PB N="143" REF="144">
cho&s;en friend was the &s;tep now to be obtained; and this wi&s;h actuated many others.</P>
<P>Till I knew the world as well as I do at pre&s;ent, it was &s;ometimes a &s;ub|ject of wonder to me, con&s;idering the envy and jealou&s;y that too often per|vade the bo&s;oms of the fairer &s;ex, that young ladies, apparently neglect|ing their own intere&s;t, attended &s;ole|ly to that of their acquaintance: but the my&s;tery was &s;oon developed: to be the friend of the Duche&s;s, Mar|chione&s;s, or Counte&s;s, is a much ea&s;ier attainment than to be Duche&s;s, Marchione&s;s, or Counte&s;s, your&s;elf; and perhaps the kind friend whom
<PB N="144" REF="145">
you may have a&s;&s;i&s;ted may a&s;&s;i&s;t you in turn, though in an humbler pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Kitty now endeavoured to recol|lect and practi&s;e all the refinement &s;he had learned at the boarding-&s;chool: but in vain; for &s;he had &s;ince imbibed much coar&s;ene&s;s of manner, and could not wholly check it, though &s;he did in part; and, a&s;|&s;uming a great degree of vivacity, concealed from mo&s;t of the inha|bitants of Bellingham the natural vulgarity of her language and ad|dre&s;s. But Mi&s;s Carruther, edu|cated in real high life, and having lived &s;o long among really fa&s;hion|able
<PB N="145" REF="146">
people, was not to be deceived. She thought it &s;trange; but endea|voured to per&s;uade her&s;elf it was in Mi&s;s Moreland the effects of a con|vent education, and the want of knowing Engli&s;h cu&s;toms; for Kitty, by finding out Mi&s;s Carruther's weak &s;ide, and accommodating her&s;elf to her foibles, was become a peculiar favourite. In conver&s;ation &s;he al|ways addre&s;&s;ed her in this way&mdash; "Emily, my dear girl, how good you are to a forlorn &s;tranger like me:" and this appellation, "dear girl," was very liberally be&s;towed by the artful impo&s;tor; and it &s;ucceeded but too well, as the reader is already in|formed: therefore to dwell longer on
<PB N="146" REF="147">
the&s;e circum&s;tances would be unne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When Mr. Thom&s;on, in the good|ne&s;s of his heart, mentioned the re|turn of the Saxbys, who&s;e &s;ervants, he &s;uppo&s;&s;ed from the contents of Sir George's letter, &s;he would be &s;o hap|py to &s;ee, &s;he was panic-&s;truck by the apprehen&s;ion of di&s;covery, and determined to leave the country with whatever &s;he could pick up; but before this &s;cheme was put into exe|cution, &s;he was told Mrs. Saxby had di&s;charged both James and Lucy for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had afforded her; and this, by renewing her hopes, induced her to alter her plan.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">A few days after this, &s;he met Mr. Saxby accidentally. He had learned &s;he was in the country, and introduced him&s;elf by apologizing for the conduct of his wife, and hinted a wi&s;h that &s;he had claimed his protection in&s;tead of his &s;ervants, "as he &s;hould have been happy in devoting his future life to her.'</P>
<P>She replied, with extreme cour|te&s;y, that "even now his protection would not be unacceptable;" and he was too gallant not to take a hint &s;o fairly given. In &s;hort, a few meet|ings more &s;ettled their &s;cheme; and it was agreed he &s;hould meet her on the road from Sir William Arling|ton's,
<PB N="148" REF="149">
and take her to London. This was effected as has been already de&s;cribed, and they &s;et off together; but their harmony was not of long continuance. Mr. Saxby detected her in an attempt to &s;ecure his pur&s;e, and di&s;carded her with the ignominy &s;he merited. Kitty then returned to her former lodgings, and, enquir|ing for her old lover, learned he was apprehended for a burglary which he had committed during her coun|try excur&s;ion, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed he would be condemned. Di&s;tracted at this information, &s;he flew to the pri&s;on, and, di&s;po&s;ing of all her ill|gotten trea&s;ure to the pawnbroker, who gave her a trifle compared to
<PB N="149" REF="150">
their real value, promi&s;ing a far|ther &s;um when they were &s;old, &s;he gave it to her unfortunate lover, to &s;ecure, if po&s;&s;ible, his &s;afety. In the mean time Sir George vi&s;ited the pawnbroker, and &s;he was glad to accept the ten guineas, le&s;t her life al&s;o &s;hould be endangered. But this as well as the re&s;t of the money &s;he could rai&s;e was ineffectual: her lover was brought in guilty, and &s;oon after &s;uffered the puni&s;hment &s;o ju&s;tly his due. Kitty then, having di&s;po&s;ed even of her wearing apparel to pro|cure him the few indulgencies he re|quired, fell into poverty and &s;ick|ne&s;s; for her con&s;titution, weakened by di&s;&s;ipation and her attendance
<PB N="150" REF="151">
on him, could not re&s;i&s;t the attacks of a &s;low fever, under which &s;he was &s;inking when Lord Milbanke and our hero paid her this apparently un|welcome vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Except palliating a few circum|&s;tances and excu&s;ing others, &s;he re|lated the above hi&s;tory with tolerable preci&s;ion; and Sir George, far from pro&s;ecuting his intended revenge, now only thought how he might re|lieve her. He drew out his pur&s;e, and, cautioning her again&s;t a relap&s;e into vice (for &s;he pro&s;e&s;&s;ed her&s;elf a &s;incere penitent), gave her &s;ufficient for her pre&s;ent exigencies. Lord Milbanke then a&s;ked a direction to
<PB N="151" REF="152">
her parents, and enquired if &s;he would return to them? "They will not re|ceive me, I fear," replied &s;he, her eyes &s;treaming with tears. "That we will enquire," returned Lord Mil|banke, greatly affected; "and, if &s;ucce&s;sful, you &s;hall hear from us again tomorrow." She endeavoured to expre&s;s her thanks: but her voice failed; and, before &s;he could articu|late, they had left the room.</P>
<P>They went directly to the Borough; and painting the &s;cene they had wit|ne&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t pathetic colours to Mr. Harris and his wife, they con&s;ented to receive their mi&s;erable child; and when re&s;entment for her
<PB N="152" REF="153">
crimes had &s;ub&s;ided, parental ten|derne&s;s overcame them, and they would have gone to her in&s;tantly: but this Lord Milbanke would not permit; he &s;aid, "in her &s;tate of health, &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;e might be fa|tal; but he would prepare her to re|ceive them the following morning." He then gently hinted, that all her errors were originally the effects of an education improper for her &s;ta|tion in life: to this they a&s;&s;ented, and promi&s;ed to atone for it by every effort in their power, to re&s;tore their unhappy child to health, to virtue, and con&s;equently to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>On leaving the Borough, they went
<PB N="153" REF="154">
once more to the poor girl, and in|formed her that the next day &s;he might expect her parents, who had promi&s;ed not only to receive but for|give her; and then entreated &s;he would cautiou&s;ly avoid the &s;lighte&s;t temptations to vice, and per&s;evere in a &s;trict penitence. In a tran&s;port of gratitude &s;he fell on her knees, and, after thanking them for recon|ciling her to her father and mother, declared, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, "&s;he would &s;trictly adhere to their ad|vice," a&s;&s;uring them that "the mi&s;er|able and untimely end of the man with whom &s;he had lived &s;o long had its proper effect on her mind,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
by proving the folly as well as the danger of unprincipled conduct."</P>
<P>They now left her, and had the following day the &s;atisfaction of hear|ing &s;he was removed home with le&s;s difficulty than from her weak &s;tate could have been expected; and our hero, inclo&s;ing a bank-note, wrote a few lines to the father, de&s;iring it might be appropriated to procuring her every a&s;&s;i&s;tance her melancholy &s;ituation required. He thus acquit|ted his con&s;cience with re&s;pect to Kitty Harris, who certainly de&s;erved not &s;o much attention, if the rules of ju&s;tice were only to be con&s;idered;
<PB N="155" REF="156">
but Sir George Warrington always remembered,
<Q><L>The quality of mercy is not &s;train'd;</L>
<L>It droppeth like the gentle rain from Heaven,</L>
<L>Upon the place beneath:</L></Q>
And his own bo&s;om proved,

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero now meant to devote every hour to the &s;earch for Loui&s;a, in which Lord Milbanke intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t; but their plan was fru&s;trated by a letter from Mr. Thom&s;on, in|forming him that his &s;teward was dangerou&s;ly ill, and wi&s;hed if po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ee him before his end, to re&s;ign all his accounts into his own hands. This reque&s;t, though it came very mal &agrave;-propos, Sir George re&s;olved in&s;tantly to comply with; and, taking a ha&s;ty leave of his uncle
<PB N="157" REF="158">
and aunt, &s;et out the &s;ame day: but, on his arrival late in the evening, heard Mr. Wharton was &s;o much re|covered as to be out of danger; the gout, which had been flying from his head to his &s;tomach, being now &s;et|tled into a regular fit. He would not, therefore, vi&s;it him that night; but the next morning went to his hou&s;e, which was &s;ituated in the park, and, after &s;taying with him a &s;hort time, proceeded to Mr. Thom&s;on's, with whom he &s;pent the remainder of the day, conver&s;ing on pa&s;t events, and mutually regretting the impo|&s;ition that had been practi&s;ed, &s;ince the con&s;equences were &s;o unfortu|nate. But the good Vicar &s;incerely
<PB N="158" REF="159">
rejoiced to &s;ee his young friend &s;o much improved in mind and per&s;on, and to learn from him&s;elf, that his under&s;tanding was cleared from tho&s;e errors which had overclouded it when they parted. Indeed his im|provement in every re&s;pect was too vi&s;ible to e&s;cape notice. An ac|quaintance with the fa&s;hionable world, the &s;ociety of informed and poli&s;hed men, of amiable and ele|gant women, had given a dignity to his own manners and addre&s;s, and a refinement to his language and con|ver&s;ation, that had been only want|ing to render him a complete gentle|man; and Mr. Thom&s;on had now the &s;atisfaction of beholding him all
<PB N="159" REF="160">
he wi&s;hed. His attachment to the beautiful Mi&s;s Moreland had al&s;o contributed its &s;hare to this altera|tion in our hero: perhaps, indeed, love alone might have effected it; and Loui&s;a, like Iphigenia, without any foreign aid might have poli&s;hed this ru&s;tic Cymon&mdash;"a &s;wain" (for he was not a clown) "who never dreamt of love."</P>
<P>When our hero returned home, about eleven o'clock at night, the conver&s;ation of the day had &s;o &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed the image of Loui&s;a on his mind, that, certain he could not re&s;t till his thoughts had taken ano|ther turn, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervant
<PB N="160" REF="161">
who attended him, &s;aying "he &s;hould read for an hour or two," and bade the man go to bed. On opening a book that lay on the table, he found it was not congenial to his pre&s;ent &s;entiments, and re&s;olved to look for another. No other, however, was in his apartment; and, taking up the candle, he walked &s;lowly and &s;ilently along the gallery, at the other end of which was the library, le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;turb the family, who he imagined were all quiet. But a faint light fla&s;hing acro&s;s at a di&s;tance convinced him he was mi&s;taken. On approaching nearer, he &s;aw it pro|ceeded from the &s;tudy-door, which was half open; and, on looking in,
<PB N="161" REF="162">
&s;aw a tall figure in white, with a light in her hand, at the farther end of the room, taking down a book from one of the higher &s;helves. He was &s;tartled, but not terrified, at this appearance, well convinced it was none of his own family: but what were his emotions when, on her turn|ing half round, he di&s;covered his long lo&s;t, long regretted Loui&s;a! Surpri&s;e for a moment totally over|came him; he di&s;believed the evidence of his &s;en&s;es, and almo&s;t imagined that the wildne&s;s of his fancy had rai&s;ed an illu&s;ive form to cheat him into momentary happine&s;s. But an|xious for conviction, and forgetting the place, the hour, and the terror
<PB N="162" REF="163">
he mu&s;t excite, he threw open the door, and, flying towards her, caught her in his arms, exclaiming&mdash;"Have I then found you, mo&s;t beloved, mo&s;t adored of women!" He could &s;ay no more: a loud &s;cream from Loui&s;a at once convinced him of the folly of his conduct; and &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at his feet. The alarm brought Mrs. Newel the hou&s;e|keeper from her apartment; and, ter|rified at the appearance of her ma&s;|ter and the &s;ituation of Mi&s;s More|land, &s;he &s;ummoned the other &s;er|vants, and, calling for drops, endea|voured to re&s;tore her to life; but in vain: her di&s;order re&s;i&s;ted all the efforts of medicine; and our hero
<PB N="163" REF="164">
walked the apartment in an agony of grief and de&s;pair. After repeated applications, &s;he &s;hewed &s;ome &s;igns of returning &s;en&s;e, and in the &s;ame degree Sir George found his hopes revive.</P>
<P>When tolerably recovered, he gen|tly approached her; but on his at|tempting to &s;peak, he was interrupt|ed by her addre&s;&s;ing him with a mix|ture of apprehen&s;ion and dignity&mdash; "Why, Sir, do you thus per&s;ecute a defencele&s;s and unhappy being, who is not con&s;cious of having ever offended you? You have already driven me from one &s;ecure a&s;ylum, and deprived me of the only friend
<PB N="164" REF="165">
the whole world afforded me. Do not again force me to &s;eek another refuge; at lea&s;t tell me what it is you accu&s;e me of&mdash;inform me how I have injured you?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Newel's &s;urpri&s;e was ex|treme: &s;he thought the fright had deprived her of rea&s;on; but Sir George's an&s;wer calmed her terror. He threw him&s;elf at Loui&s;a's feet, and be&s;ought her to hear him.</P>
<P>"You have," &s;aid he, "indeed been cruelly treated, but believe me I was innocent: it was the Mi&s;s Wil|mots who, under the ma&s;k of ju&s;|tice and benevolence, vilified you to
<PB N="165" REF="166">
Mrs. Edgeworth: but &s;he as well as my&s;elf is now undeceived; and if, Mi&s;s Moreland, you can conde&s;cend to forgive a man who has been un|de&s;ignedly the cau&s;e of your misfor|tunes, my future life &s;hall be de|voted to proving the &s;incerity of my repentance, and the extent of my gratitude."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Moreland's a&s;toni&s;hment was extreme, and her anxiety to under|&s;tand his meaning was no le&s;s: but it was too late for an explanation that night: he promi&s;ed in the morn|ing to relate every thing, but en|treated &s;he would then retire, as he &s;aw her &s;pirits were &s;till too much
<PB N="166" REF="167">
agitated to bear any farther conver|&s;ation. She complied with his re|que&s;t, and, attended by Mrs. Newel, went to her apartment. Sir George al&s;o returned to his, but was unable for &s;ome time to compo&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let me now account to my rea|ders for the unexpected appearance of Loui&s;a at Warrington Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>During her journey with farmer John&s;on, &s;he entreated &s;he might be introduced to his relation by the name of We&s;tern; alleging &s;he had very &s;trong rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to be unknown; and with this reque&s;t he complied. On his arrival at War|rington
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Ca&s;tle, where his cou&s;in was hou&s;ekeeper, he related all he knew of her &s;tory&mdash;&s;aid "&s;he had been &s;uckled by his &s;i&s;ter, but had not a friend in all England"&mdash;and begged her protection for a time, and that &s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, recommend her to &s;ome way of life where &s;he might gain an hone&s;t livelihood. This was the &s;um of the good farmer's &s;peech to Mrs. Newel, whil&s;t the trembling Loui&s;a waited in the park to hear what her recep|tion would be. Indeed it was every thing &s;he wi&s;hed: Mrs. Newel came out, and, begging her to walk in, a&s;|&s;ured her of every attention in her power to be&s;tow; and added, as her
<PB N="168" REF="169">
ma&s;ter was now ab&s;ent, and not like|ly to return for a long time, &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ca&s;tle and all it con|tained.</P>
<P>This intelligence was very agree|able to Mi&s;s Moreland, who would not have liked to be the inmate of a large family; and farmer John&s;on had the &s;atisfaction of leaving her well, and happily &s;ettled with his benevolent relation, who grew every hour more attached to her young gue&s;t: but her &s;pirits, &s;o long ha|ra&s;&s;ed by alarm and anxiety, now at once gave way, and &s;he was &s;eized with a violent nervous fever, which obliged her to apply to phy&s;ical ad|vice.
<PB N="169" REF="170">
Mrs. Newel attended her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s; and &s;he was only ju&s;t recovering when the illne&s;s of the &s;teward occa&s;ioned the return of Sir George. This circum&s;tance the hou&s;ekeeper carefully concealed, knowing it would di&s;tre&s;s her; and as &s;he &s;lept in a chamber looking into the garden, and had yet only left it to go into the &s;tudy, which it joined, &s;he thought &s;he might keep it a &s;ecret for &s;ome days at lea&s;t. Had Loui&s;a been accu&s;ed of any thing but ab&s;olute fraud, &s;he would have told every circum&s;tance to her kind friend; but, as it was, cautiou&s;ly avoided the &s;ubject, as &s;he could only deny, not di&s;prove, the fact; and
<PB N="170" REF="171">
there was &s;omething &s;o degrading even in the &s;u&s;picion, &s;he could not bear to avow it. Or had Mrs. Newel been of the common character of hou&s;ekeepers, and given her an ac|count of the impo&s;ition &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully carried on at Mr. Thom&s;on's, the whole my&s;tery would have been at once revealed; but, as this was not the ca&s;e, they each remained in utter ignorance.</P>
<P>On the evening this important di&s;|covery was made, Loui&s;a, finding her&s;elf di&s;inclined to &s;leep, went in|to the library, from the &s;ame motive that brought Sir George. What pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of their meet|ing
<PB N="171" REF="172">
has been already related; but when Loui&s;a retired with Mrs. Newel, the latter, who had heard Sir George addre&s;s her by the name of Moreland, could no longer conceal her knowledge of the events which &s;o lately occurred at Warrington, and in&s;tantly related all that had pa&s;&s;|ed at the vicarage to the a&s;toni&s;hed Loui&s;a, who now under&s;tood why &s;he had been &s;o unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, and of what. In return &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to Mrs. Newel the whole of her hi&s;tory; and the good woman &s;ympathized in her troubles, and rejoiced they were now at an end.</P>
<P>The next morning, when our hero
<PB N="172" REF="173">
and Mi&s;s Moreland met, an entire explanation en&s;ued; and Sir George informed her that &s;he had a tender and expecting relation, who would afford her the protection &s;he wi&s;hed for, but he added a &s;light hint of the hopes he had ventured to indulge, which, he &s;aid, "he knew Lord and Lady Milbanke would endeavour to &s;trengthen." When their conver&s;a|tion was at an end, he flew to the vicarage; but Mr. Thom&s;on and his wife were already acquainted with the happy di&s;covery through the means of a &s;ervant, who was impa|tient to be the fir&s;t to tell the news, as he called it, of the right Mi&s;s Moreland's being come to Warring|ton
<PB N="173" REF="174">
at la&s;t. Mrs. Thom&s;on now anticipated his wi&s;hes, and invited Loui&s;a to &s;tay at their hou&s;e till &s;he was well enough to attend her aunt. This invitation &s;he readily accepted; and Sir George, con&s;cious &s;he could not remain with propriety under his own roof, was well plea&s;ed at her being in a family where he might be a con&s;tant as he was always a wel|come gue&s;t, and could avail him|&s;elf of every opportunity to obtain an intere&s;t in her affections.</P>
<P>His next &s;tep after her removal was to write to Lord Milbanke, Mrs. Edgeworth, and Captain Mon|tague. The former an&s;wered his
<PB N="174" REF="175">
letter in per&s;on. Lady Milbanke had been confined with a &s;light fever, and could not accompany him; but he was charged not to return with|out her niece, if &s;he was well enough to bear the journey: and her health being now re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;he pre|pared to attend him. Mr. and Mrs. Thom&s;on could not part from her without great reluctance, as from her &s;ociety they had received as much plea&s;ure, as they had expe|rienced pain from the vi&s;it of their late unprincipled gue&s;t. But they were con&s;oled by a well-founded hope, that it would not be very long before &s;he would return in the cha|racter of Lady Warrington.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">This important di&s;covery &s;oon reached Bellingham; and tho&s;e fa|milies in particular who had coun|tenanced the pretended were now impatient to know the real Mi&s;s Moreland: but her late illne&s;s and naturally retired di&s;po&s;ition pre|vented the indulgence of their wi&s;hes. But Mr. Kettering, purpo&s;ely making a vi&s;it to the good Vicar, was for|tunate enough to &s;ee her; and the report he carried back of her ex|treme beauty and elegance was by &s;ome di&s;believed, by others unwil|lingly credited; but the young la|dies were &s;ingly and unitedly of opinion, that, if &s;he were as hand|&s;ome as po&s;&s;ible, Sir George might
<PB N="176" REF="177">
have had a wife as beautiful and accompli&s;hed without going &s;o far from home.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AS tho&s;e events of the life of Sir George Warrington which I have taken upon me to relate are drawing to|wards a conclu&s;ion, I have little more to &s;ay on the &s;ubject. Loui&s;a ex|perienced a mo&s;t affectionate recep|tion from her aunt, and found in Lord Milbanke's family &s;o happy an a&s;ylum, &s;he could not have wi&s;h|ed to change it for another, had not the merit of our hero in due time had its proper effect on a heart which was not an in&s;en&s;ible one;
<PB N="178" REF="179">
and &s;he acknowledged, with a frank|ne&s;s that did her honour, he was the only man for whom &s;he had ever felt the &s;lighte&s;t degree of preference, and that her e&s;teem and affection for him were decided and &s;incere.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this confe&s;&s;ion, Sir George began every preparation on his &s;ide, and Lady Milbanke took care her niece &s;hould be in readine&s;s for the happy day that was to unite them. In the mid&s;t of this bu&s;tle, Lucy Clerke was not forgotten: &s;he was ea&s;ily traced to her aunt's, and Sir George be&s;towed on her a boun|tiful reward for her attention to his beloved Loui&s;a, and engaged her as
<PB N="179" REF="180">
Lady Warrington's future atten|dant.</P>
<P>James Bever returned to Portman-&s;quare, from his un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;earch, ju&s;t after Lord Milbanke had received the joyful intelligence, and attended him to Warrington. The unfeigned joy with which both James and Lucy met her, on whom they had for|merly be&s;towed &s;uch an almo&s;t unre|turnable obligation, could only be equalled by the gratitude &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed. Indeed this te&s;timony of her merit would have been a &s;uffi|cient evidence in her favour; but her virtues were now not only con&s;pi|cuous but acknowledged. She did
<PB N="180" REF="181">
not in her pro&s;perity forget any of tho&s;e who in di&s;tre&s;s had &s;oothed, and in adver&s;ity &s;upported her. To Mrs. Edgeworth &s;he wrote a very grateful and affectionate letter, accompanied by a pre&s;ent for the children equally valuable and elegant. To farmer John&s;on's family &s;he al&s;o &s;ent &s;uch things as were at once u&s;eful and &s;uitable to their &s;tation in life.</P>
<P>The Savilles were at this time in town; and Sir George had great plea&s;ure in introducing them to his e&s;teemed relations, and his beloved Loui&s;a, for whom they had long felt a particular intere&s;t. They inform|ed him Mr. Wilmot had con&s;ented
<PB N="181" REF="182">
without he&s;itation to be&s;tow his el|de&s;t daughter on Captain Montague, and that Ro&s;etta and Fidelia met with the univer&s;al contempt they me|rited.</P>
<P>Their &s;ociety was &s;oon rendered complete by the arrival of Myrtilla, who was in a few weeks to give her hand to the Captain. Mi&s;s Wilmot and Loui&s;a were too equally amiable not to e&s;teem each other warmly; and the former expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood of War|rington, Sir George with much plea|&s;ure informed Montague of a hou&s;e at that time vacant in his neigh|bourhood. Mrs. Saxby had &s;o high|ly
<PB N="182" REF="183">
re&s;ented her hu&s;band's conduct with re&s;pect to Kitty Harris, that a vio|lent quarrel en&s;ued, which ended in a &s;eparation. He cho&s;e to fix in the metropolis, and the lady to live any where but at Barclay Manor, where &s;he had rendered her&s;elf an object of contempt and ridicule. Of cour&s;e it was to be let; and Captain Montague, without he&s;itation, immediately en|gaged it.</P>
<P>Kitty Harris lingered a few weeks, and then expired a &s;incere penitent. Her parents at fir&s;t lamented her untimely fate, but were at length re|conciled by the reflection that &s;he was not cut off in ha&s;te, but had
<PB N="183" REF="184">
lei&s;ure to repent of her pa&s;t crimes; and they humbly hoped her penitence would be accepted.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day witne&s;&s;ed the union of Captain Montague and Myrtilla Wilmot, of Sir George Warrington and Loui&s;a Moreland; and the &s;un never ro&s;e on four people more de|&s;erving of every ble&s;&s;ing this world can afford. The &s;incere yet ardent pa&s;&s;ion of Sir George is well repaid by the real and tender affection of Loui&s;a, who, from having been &s;o long to&s;&s;ed by the tempe&s;ts of life, is now more deeply and more gratefully &s;en&s;ible of the unclouded pro&s;pect around her, and more thankful to
<PB N="184" REF="185">
that Being, who pre&s;erved her in in|numerable dangers, and has at length be&s;towed on her as unmixed felicity as in this life we ever dare hope for or expect.</P>
