<HEAD>LETTER XVII. Mr. WESTWOOD, to H. HANDFORD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favour of the 14th in&s;t. and &s;hall proceed to give you an account of a phaenomenon that has lately appeared here. A young fellow is arrived from London, to join a brotherhood of players, who u&s;ually make us a periodical vi&s;it at this &s;ea&s;on
<PB N="2" REF="14">
of the year. His per&s;on is compleat and elegant, his voice remarkably &s;weet and articulate, and his deportment that of a perfect gentleman. It is impo&s;&s;ible to look on him without feeling an imme|diate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour, which increa&s;es the more he is &s;een and heard. He played Romeo la&s;t Friday evening. It was his fir&s;t appearance, yet I never beheld a performance that gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure; &s;uch pathetic tenderne&s;s; a voice &s;o &s;weetly plaintive and amo|rous, attended with an air of &s;o much &s;incerity, that it was impo&s;ible for any one who did not feel, or had not felt, the pa&s;&s;ion of love to have been &s;o expre&s;|&s;ive. But, from what I have ob&s;erved &s;ince, I have taken it for granted that <HI>he is,</HI> at this in&s;tant, under its influence. Whether <HI>he is</HI> or no, I am certain all the women in Kendal, young or old, that have &s;een him, <HI>are;</HI> and the re&s;t &s;oon
<PB N="3" REF="15">
will be. For there is more gazing after him when he makes his appearance in the &s;treet, than there was at the la&s;t comet. No wonder, he is ma&s;ter of every ac|compli&s;hment, without any &s;eeming knowledge of &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>I prevailed on him to &s;up with me after the play. His conver&s;ation and behavi|our more than confirmed every thing I had conceived in his favour. His abilities &s;eem to have no bounds, and, after &s;upper, we furni&s;hed him with a fre&s;h opportunity of di&s;playing them, by introducing a little concert, in which he might be &s;aid to be the only perform|er, &s;ince he was the only one that was li&s;tened to. He &s;ung and played, and with &s;o much ta&s;te, pa&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;|&s;ion, that every body was amazed, as well as delighted. I dare &s;ay you think I am drawing a very extravagant picture, but, I can a&s;&s;ure you, all, who have &s;een
<PB N="4" REF="16">
him, &s;peak of him as the mo&s;t agreeable and extraordinary young fellow they have ever known.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t under&s;tand I had occa|&s;ion to do him a little &s;ervice, by ri&s;ing up his champion on the night that he played. He is &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this trifling favour that he thinks he cannot enough admire my genero&s;ity. It was thus: Notwith|&s;tanding the &s;urprize and plea&s;ure the &s;pectators were under, when he came upon the &s;tage, at the beauty of his figure, there i&s;&s;ued from &s;ome part of the gallery a loud hi&s;s. The effect this had upon him was very extraordi|nary; the blood for&s;ook his cheeks, his limbs tottered, and his whole frame was thrown vi&s;ibly into great di&s;order. I was &s;o &s;hocked at their rudene&s;s and in|ju&s;tice, that I could not conceal my rage, but jumped upon one of the &s;eats in the pit and harangued the mob, pretty
<PB N="5" REF="17">
much, I believe, in that kind of language to which they were accu&s;tomed; and, as I am rather a favourite, with &s;ome of them, my declaring on the &s;tranger's &s;ide &s;oon overturned the party that was formed again&s;t him; for, I am certain, that ill-judged attack could proceed from no other cau&s;e. From this time to the end of the play, nothing but the loude&s;t marks of applau&s;e were heard at every opportunity, which were not be&s;towed upon an ingrate; the effect that this encouragement had upon him was vi&s;ible, and the di&s;order, which the ignorance and malice of the di&s;&s;entients had put him into, was a &s;trong proof of his mode&s;ty and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>HE received an invitation to our a&s;|&s;embly, which, he has &s;ince told me, he believes, from motives of prudence, he mu&s;t be obliged to decline. It &s;eems the
<PB N="6" REF="18">
la&s;t time the comedians were here, and while I was at college, one of them, who, from his behaviour and talents, was en|titled to re&s;pect, not &s;uppo&s;ing it any deviation from the rules of decorum, came, one evening, to the a&s;&s;embly, upon which two or three coxcombs, led on by 'Squire Bullhead, a contemptible, overbearing puppy, whom you have heard me &s;peak of, finding them|&s;elves affronted, in&s;i&s;ted upon his being turned out of the room. Bullhead was the &s;poke&s;man, and, coming up to the comedian, &s;aid, in a very in&s;ulting man|ner, <Q>Pray friend, does &s;trolling actors ever larn to dance?</Q> The abruptne&s;s of this impudent que&s;tion, for a moment, di&s;concerted the comedian, but, recollect|ing him&s;elf, he an&s;wered, <Q>Some of them, Sir, and as ea&s;ily as &s;ome rich country boobies learn in&s;olence.</Q> <Q>Do you call me booby, Sir?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Why Sir, to be
<PB N="7" REF="19">
&s;ure I mentioned &s;omething about Booby, or Bullhead, it is not material which, I believe they are &s;ynonimous.</Q> <Q>&mdash;Nonimus! Sir, you are a nonimus vagabun, and &s;o I de&s;ires that you will quit this here room.</Q> <Q>That I &s;hall without farther ceremony, Sir,</Q> &s;aid the player, <Q>and <HI>I de&s;ire</HI> you will do me the favour to follow me.</Q> Bullhead either did not, or would not under&s;tand this intimation, but remained, amid&s;t the titters and &s;neers of the company, mut|tering &s;omething about <HI>teaching &s;uch im|pudent vagabun ra&s;cals to trude them&s;elves into the ciety gentlepeople.</HI> The comedian was not &s;o &s;atisfied, but wrote a card, the next day, requiring Bullhead to meet him, and either bring his &s;word, or a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols. This paper terrified the fool out of his wits, and he ran blub|bering with it to his wife. She po&s;ted away to &s;hew it to her father, who is an
<PB N="8" REF="20">
acting ju&s;tice. The man of the quorum &s;ent immediately for the manager, and threatened to throw him and the whole troop in jail if he did not interfere, and prevent this affair from going any farther. The comedian, at the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of his brethren, dropt his revenge, but not till he had procured a paper, &s;igned both by this redoubted 'Squire and his father-in-law, the purport of which was, a promi&s;e not to mole&s;t the players, nor, by any means, endeavour to prevent their coming to Kendal as u&s;ual. A night or two after this affair hap|pened the Beaux Stratagem was played, and the audience bur&s;t into an uproar of laughter, when Scrub &s;ays, <Q>If our ma&s;ters in the country receive a challenge, the fir&s;t thing they do is to tell their wives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> and 'Squire Bullhead be|came the je&s;t of the town.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="21">NOTWITHSTANDING this, I hope we &s;hall overcome the &s;cruples of our young Romeo. The girls are all dying to &s;ee him dance, and have prote&s;ted they'll none of them refu&s;e him for a partner; one or two of the Bullhead connection excepted, who affect to turn up the no&s;e at this extraordinary complai&s;ance to a player.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. T. STENTOR, to J. DRUMSHANDRUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend JAMES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROPHESIED what would come to pa&s;s. I knew well enough how it would be. This Alwyn leads the people in a &s;tring. I fore&s;aw it.&mdash;Old &s;ervants are forgot.&mdash;I hate &s;uch cur&s;t ingratitude, but I never met with any thing el&s;e from the public, even in my youth, &s;o I mu&s;t not be &s;urprized at it now. I have been their &s;lave long enough for nothing, and now I may &s;tarve and be damned, for what they care.&mdash;Not but I planned matters pretty well too. The youth was &s;taggered. He was not u&s;ed to &s;tand fire, and would have given ground at the fir&s;t di&s;charge, if he had not been &s;upported by the
<PB N="11" REF="23">
pit. I have been tolerably cautious, and he has not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion it was I who directed the battery of hi&s;&s;es that was played off at him; though &s;ome of my good friends in the company took abundance of pains to per&s;uade him to &s;uch a belief.&mdash;He's a green|horn, a gull that will dive at a red rag in&s;tead of a herring. I can do what I will with him, for he believes me to be his be&s;t friend. I would have him con|tinue in that mi&s;take, while he continues in this company. If I am not deceiv|ed, I have already found a proper bait for the gudgeon. He thinks me &s;o faithful that he will &s;ay any thing to me, tru&s;t me with any thing, except one. I cannot get out of him, hitherto, what he grieves about. I ob&s;erve he is always melancholy, loves to be alone, and take &s;olitary walks; &s;ighs oftener than a weaver at a Methodi&s;t &s;ermon,
<PB N="12" REF="24">
and looks as mournful as a friar on Good-Friday. Perhaps he is in love, if &s;o I'll find it out.</P>
<P>BE that as it may, there is a certain lady, of this town, in love with him. She &s;ent for me, t'other night, to bribe me to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;o you may think &s;he is pretty far gone. It &s;eems the youth is &s;hy, and the lady impatient; I'm glad I am called in, for, &s;ince I am to pre&s;cribe, I'll take care not to neglect my fees. She may prove a valuable patient, and promi&s;es to bleed freely, if I can accompli&s;h her de&s;ign, which is to find out who the young&s;ter is in love with; for that he is in love, &s;he takes for granted; and, as I hinted, I'm very much of her opinion. She has given me a trouble|&s;ome ta&s;k, but I have undertaken to perform it, and it &s;hall go hard but I will keep my word. Neverthele&s;s, as there is no knowing what turn af|fairs may take, I have &s;ent my wife off
<PB N="13" REF="25">
to join your company, and thank you for the trouble you have taken in the matter. She will give you this, and my be&s;t wi&s;hes. The Kendalians are all running wild after this Alwyn, and come in &s;hoals every night he plays. They would be d&mdash;d before they would come to &s;ee a better actor. I may play to the benches, now the whim has taken them. A parcel of &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;heep, that will follow any bell-weather, if &s;ome fool only &s;tarts up and bids them admire his bleating. He was invited to the a&s;&s;embly, and I took great pains to per&s;uade him to go; I knew how it would turn out. Some among them are affronted, and though he's &s;upport|ed in his vanity by a few of what they call the heads of the town, I'm devili&s;hly cheated, if he don't get a rap of the knuckles. The party that is di&s;plea&s;ed, talks pretty confidently of his vanity and a&s;&s;urance. It was at
<PB N="14" REF="26">
the a&s;&s;embly he made the conque&s;t I have mentioned. They &s;ay he dances to admiration, and &s;ome are piqued becau&s;e they thought them&s;elves ne|glected and him too much admired. The fellow is hand&s;ome enough, and better bred than the boors of this place; who, notwith&s;tanding, fancy them&s;elves great beaus, and have as many ridiculous airs as any other pe|tits maitres; which, with their auk|ward ru&s;ticity are laughable enough.</P>
<P>ONE of the&s;e &s;parks, a Mr. Staple, is a lover of the lady who is enamoured of our young&s;ter; and I &s;hall take mea&s;ures to inform him what a dan|gerous rival he has. He was obliged to be out of town the night of the a&s;&s;embly, and Alwyn by dancing with his mi&s;tre&s;s, ingratiated him&s;elf &s;o far in her favour, that the ab&s;entee will &s;tand a fair chance to have his cong&eacute;. He is one of tho&s;e brutal, head-&s;trong
<PB N="15" REF="27">
animals that are very apt to kick, even before they feel the la&s;h, and two or three cuts will mo&s;t likely make him quite re&s;ty. Let me alone to give them, I'll take care they &s;hall &s;ting. As for the lady, &s;he does not &s;eem one of your timid dames; &s;he is a widow, a We&s;t-Indian, with all the fire of the climate in her con&s;titution; and appears to have contracted a mighty &s;trong antipathy to ba&s;hfulne&s;s in men. If &s;he can but attain her purpo&s;e, &s;he does not &s;eem to be troubled with any con&s;cientious &s;cruples about the means. &mdash;I have provocations enough, and materials are not wanting; therefore, if I don't make him pack up his boxes, I'll for&s;wear politics, and go into leading-&s;trings. Now I talk of provocations, I mu&s;t tell you, that our d&mdash;d fly-by-night ra&s;cal of a manager made me de&s;cend from Hot&s;pur to Worce&s;ter, t'other evening; and be|cau&s;e I ventured to remon&s;trate, &s;wore
<PB N="16" REF="28">
I &s;hould not play another night in the company; aye, and was mighty po&s;i|tive about the matter too, till the young favourite, Alwyn, inli&s;ted on my &s;ide, and then the old yelping hound was &s;oon &s;ilenced. This fellow, who, becau&s;e he has had art and roguery enough to &s;crape together a few tin&s;el rags, and a little daubed canva&s;s, is become as impudent and as con&s;e|quential as a petty con&s;table, or a new made ju&s;tice, and much about as wi&s;e too. He takes upon him to in&s;truct the actors; decides dogmati|cally upon any difficult pa&s;&s;age, with|out being able to read it; &s;ettles the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;cene, without a thought concerning propriety, and &s;wells at the recollection of his own &s;agacity and im|portance, like an alderman &s;aying grace after meat.&mdash;A blunder of his, the other night, in the play of Harry the Fourth, will give you an idea of his capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="29">HIS elde&s;t &s;on Daniel, who looks as &s;tupidly good-natured as a half grown ma&s;tiff, played Sir Walter Blunt, and his fat-headed father per&s;onated Douglas. The termagant Scot, as Fal|&s;taff calls him, is to kill Sir Walter; but when our pudding-headed director enter|ed, in&s;tead of &s;laying the knight his &s;on, he only &s;tood to receive one thru&s;t from him, then tumbled upon the &s;tage, like an overfed porpoi&s;e, gave a belch, in&s;tead of a groan, and pretended to expire. It would have done your heart good to have beheld the &s;tupid look of the cub Daniel, who knew <HI>he</HI> ought to have fallen. The prompter began to &s;wear the people behind the &s;cenes to laugh, and the mother, who li&s;ps delight|fully, hearing an uproar, waddled to &s;ee what was the matter; &s;he found the mi&s;|take, and clapping her mouth to the &s;ide
<PB N="18" REF="30">
of the &s;cene, began cur&s;ing her hu&s;band Roger in curious and well-cho&s;en lan|guage:&mdash;"Get up," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>Godth cuth your &s;howl, you old r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gething rathcul, get up, don't you know the child ith to die?</Q>&mdash;"You lie you b&mdash;," &s;ays Roger, "I am to die." <Q>Godth cuth your thoul, I thay, get up, the child ith to die. Dothn't the child do thir Walter, and ith n't Douglath to kill him?</Q>&mdash;Roger, however, per&s;i&s;t|ed, that he was to die, and &s;wore he would not get up. After a while the &s;pectators began to &s;moke the blunder, and li&s;ten to the curious dialogue that was pa&s;&s;ing between the dead man and his per&s;ecuting wife. You may be &s;ure they enjoyed it, and the hou&s;e was pre&s;ently in an uproar of laughter; this rouzed the butter-brained Roger's recollection, when, finding him&s;elf in the wrong box, he opened his eyes, and, after a tolerably
<PB N="19" REF="31">
&s;tupid &s;tare, which again incited the ri|&s;ibility of the audience, a&s;&s;ayed to get up.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HEAR, with great plea&s;ure, though without &s;urprize, of the favourable reception you met with at Kendal; and hope that you will pa&s;s your time very agreeably, during the &s;tay of the com|pany at that place. The party form|ed again&s;t you on your fir&s;t appearance, for a party it certainly was, gives me &s;ome concern, as I apprehend, that the little malice of your rivals is capable of affording you more real unea&s;ine&s;s than misfortunes of a much more con&s;equential &s;tamp. Fortitude can bear up again&s;t the latter, but petty
<PB N="22" REF="34">
in&s;ults, and mean, cowardly injuries are, too often, able to ruffle and &s;our the be&s;t turned di&s;po&s;ition. Pray let me have the &s;atisfaction of hearing that I am mi&s;taken, and that you laugh at the mean tricks of your enemies.</P>
<P>THIS &s;olitary retreat affords very little matter for a letter, unle&s;s I was to relate my excur&s;ions, which, though without variety of adventure, are, to me, exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing. In the&s;e de|lightful &s;cenes I indulge the flow of fancy which the &s;olemnity and &s;till|ne&s;s of the groves tend greatly to pro|mote.</P>

Sometimes, with Mr. Mait|land, I vi&s;it the planetary regions, and admire the conjectures which his cre|ative fancy makes of their u&s;es or inhabitants. From thence, according to the enlarged idea of tho&s;e great men, who, in a le&s;s enlightened age would have been deified, I gra&s;p in thought the amazing number of &s;y&s;tems that fill the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, and lo&s;e my&s;elf in the grandeur of the concep|tion.

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mr. ALWYN, to Mr. STAMFORD, Jun.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had &s;everal adventures &s;ince my la&s;t to you, which, without any apology, I &s;hall take the liberty to relate, from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that, as here|tofore, they will not be di&s;agreeable to you; having always ob&s;erved, with plea|&s;ure, the part your pa&s;&s;ions took in the mo&s;t trifling events, when they any way influenced the affairs of tho&s;e for whom you profe&s;&s;ed an e&s;teem.</P>
<P>I THEN informed you of the invita|tion I had received to go to the a&s;&s;embly; I mu&s;t now tell you of my weakne&s;s in &s;uffering their per&s;ua&s;ions to overcome
<PB N="30" REF="42">
the re&s;olution I had made not to com|ply with this invitation. I believe I do wrong to a&s;cribe it all to the force of per&s;ua&s;ion. The human heart has its foibles; mine has, however, which I cannot always conquer. I a&s;cribed the remon&s;trances of my brother comedians to their little jealou&s;ies at the preference which had been given me; this pre|ference was flattering, and, though I en|deavoured to combat that &s;elfi&s;h idea, yet, it triumphed, even while I de&s;pi&s;ed it. Not that I think any &s;ervile re&s;pect is due from the comedians to the inha|bitants; the ca&s;e is, the laws have, un|ju&s;tly, empowered the daemon of per&s;e|cution to a&s;&s;ault the profe&s;&s;ion of a player. Narrow-minded people have taken advantage of this inju&s;tice, and placed the profe&s;&s;ors at a di&s;tance, which ignorance and arrogance, at all times, &s;uppo&s;e they have a right to pre&s;erve;
<PB N="31" REF="43">
and the want of principle and abilities in the player, too frequently, ju&s;tifies this u&s;urpation. The mo&s;t uncultivated among the comedians get, habitually, and from the mere repetition of their parts, refined notions, which are &s;everal degrees beyond the &s;phere of the lower orders of the people, with whom they are obliged either to a&s;&s;ociate, or to &s;eek the &s;ociety of the di&s;&s;olute and abandon|ed among the higher, the re&s;pectable part of whom are &s;tigmatized with want of decorum, if they are known to hold any conver&s;e with men whom the law calls vagabonds. Though this is a kind of life, to which I already perceive I &s;hould by no means give the preference, except, as at pre&s;ent, from motives of convenience; yet my re&s;idence among the&s;e, frequently unfortunate &s;ons of the mu&s;es, intere&s;ts me greatly in their be|half; and I have rea&s;on to hope, from
<PB N="33" REF="44">
that philo&s;ophical liberality of &s;entiment which prevails, and &s;o nobly dignifies the pre&s;ent age, to &s;ee the time when none &s;hall have the power, and few the inclination, to oppre&s;s tho&s;e people, who, under proper regulations would be our be&s;t moral teachers.</P>
<P>I DISCOVERED an additional proof of my weakne&s;s the in&s;tant I entered the a&s;&s;embly-room. It is nece&s;&s;ary for every one, in &s;uch a place, to wear a face of mirth, on the contrary, my heart re|proached me. There is a delicacy in the &s;en&s;ations of a pure and re&s;pectful love, to which the light &s;ports of a mind, not under its influence, is often di&s;gu&s;t|ing. When I heard the &s;prightly notes of the pipe and tabor my feelings revolt|ed again&s;t &s;uch quick vibrations, and I felt an unconquerable inclination to|wards the pen&s;ero&s;o. I had con&s;ented to
<PB N="33" REF="45">
go upon no other terms but tho&s;e of forbearing to dance, if I cho&s;e &s;o to do: Mr. We&s;twood, therefore, who intro|duced me, had not provided me a part|ner, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be di&s;appointed. As my evil genius ordained, there was a lady, who&s;e partner had by &s;ome acci|dent been detained, and who could not dance for want of one; I, not knowing her motive for &s;itting &s;till, had entered into a &s;light conver&s;ation with her, which had not continued long before the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, &s;uppo&s;ing, probably, I had an inclination to dance, came and pre&s;ented her hand to me; and, the lady not expre&s;&s;ing any reluctance, I could not be &s;o unmannerly as to refu&s;e; though I believe I accepted the compliment with &s;uch an awkward, and ab&s;ent air, that &s;he mu&s;t certainly perceive it. The minuets were not over; we were called forth, and the lady, though
<PB N="34" REF="46">
not the younge&s;t in the room, moved gracefully enough, and acquired a &s;hare of admiration equal to tho&s;e who had gone before. I perceived &s;he was not entirely &s;atisfied with my languor, and made &s;everal good-natured efforts to in|&s;pire me; for, indeed, a heavy partner, in dancing, is a dull companion, but they were ineffectual. I was wandering through the haunts of Maria, was di&s;|cour&s;ing with her, gazing at her, &s;ighing for her, and all the fiddles in England could not per&s;uade me to leave &s;uch de|lightful company. The lady's name, who did me this honour, is Vincent; &s;he is a widow, a native of the We&s;t Indies, and almo&s;t as great a &s;tranger here as I am; &s;he is very hand&s;ome, has an ea&s;y air, a good &s;hape, and appears to be about thirty.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="47">DO not laugh, dear Charles, nor think me vain for what I am going to &s;ay; I wi&s;h it were otherwi&s;e, but, in &s;pite of my <HI>ennui,</HI> I had the misfortune to plea&s;e Mrs. Vincent. There is no danger to the lady's character from &s;aying this to you; and the remembrance of one, whom I &s;hall never forget, reproaches me for &s;uffering her pa&s;&s;ion, although it is a thing out of my power to prevent, ex|cept by a precipitate flight, which I &s;hall certainly make, if I hear any more upon this theme. After all, it is an aukward &s;ituation for a man, to whom love is ten|derly and forcibly declared. It &s;eems exceedingly unnatural for him, and almo&s;t &s;hameful, to reject the advances of a fine woman. I believe it impo&s;&s;ible, except where, as in my ca&s;e, the affec|tions are totally pre-engaged; for this rea&s;on, when I have read the &s;tory of the young I&s;raelite, and the amorous Egyp|tian,
<PB N="36" REF="48">
I have been apt to conclude that, be&s;ide the &s;in of ingratitude to his ma&s;ter, which, doubtle&s;s, has great influence over a virtuous mind, yet, con&s;idering the force of the temptation, which was almo&s;t too much for nature to &s;upport, Jo&s;eph had certainly a mi&s;tre&s;s of whom he was enamoured.</P>
<P>YOUNG We&s;twood appeared &s;ome|what chagrined about my dancing, though he endeavoured to hide it. He told me, that had I not profe&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, little &s;hort of a re&s;olution, not to partake of the amu&s;ement, he would have provided me another partner.</P>
<P>THE report that Mr. Stentor was the per&s;on who was principally con|cerned in the oppo&s;ition I met with on my fir&s;t appearance was, I am ful|ly convinced, without foundation. His
<PB N="37" REF="49">
partiality and attachment to me are evident; and I find my&s;elf greatly in arrear to him for the attention he pays to my intere&s;ts, by every a&s;&s;iduity in his power. I perceive the &s;neers of the other members of the company when he does me any little kindne&s;s; and un|der&s;tand their &s;arca&s;ms, which imply, that he has a farther de&s;ign than is ap|parent; but, as he has no point to gain, the &s;uppo&s;ition, be&s;ides its malignancy, is ridiculous. I &s;ee no rea&s;on that we have to con&s;true a friendly de&s;ire to plea&s;e into officiou&s;ne&s;s; and we all find, in &s;ome degree, a &s;atisfaction in being loved and re&s;pected, even though the object is beneath any claim of re|ciprocal affection. But this is not Mr. Stentor's ca&s;e; his under&s;tanding, though clouded and embarra&s;&s;ed by a life of poverty, is much above the level; his temper is tractable, and his
<PB N="38" REF="50">
addre&s;s in&s;inuating; not, it is true, with|out a &s;mall proportion of flattery, and has, at times, the a&s;pect of cringing; but the fir&s;t he corrects, where he finds it di&s;plea&s;ing; and the latter is not to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider the &s;tate of dependence in which he has con&s;tantly lived.</P>
<P>I CAME here for country air, and the improvement of my health; but, I fear, I &s;hall never become the rival of old Parr, none of my wai&s;tcoats get too tight for me. My cheeks improve, ra|ther in length than breadth; and though the colour has not entirely for&s;ook them, yet it &s;eems like an amba&s;&s;ador on the eve of a war, in hourly expectation of departing. I ought to beg pardon for &s;peaking with &s;o much levity, upon a &s;ubject which, though my &s;ituation renders it a light one, to me, yet is one
<PB N="39" REF="51">
that your goodne&s;s and prejudice in my favour have made intere&s;ting, on your part. But forgive me; &s;uffer the &s;mile of re&s;ignation and melancholy to, &s;ometimes, &s;teal a vi&s;it. Yes, Charles, I will own, life has no charms without Maria. Death opens a friendly door for a harra&s;&s;ed fugitive, and welcomes him to the man&s;ion of repo&s;e. Why then &s;hould I dread to enter? Even Maria, the lovely Maria, whom all hearts doat on, all eyes adore, mu&s;t &s;oon take refuge there. What is an hour, a year, a century? They are all equal, and Socrates and Shake&s;pear are, now, no longer the con&s;cious vehicles of wi&s;dom and delight. Where is the dif|ference between a moment, and a mil|lion of ages, if the cold hand of death mu&s;t, at la&s;t, put out the lamp? No|thing, but Maria, could bribe me to wi&s;h for life; and death, as Dryden &s;ays,

<OPENER><SALUTE>My DEAR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to my friend, Drum&s;handrugh, for informing me of your arrival. I told you it would be Tue&s;day night before you could get there, but you always would be po&s;i|tive.</P>
<P>MRS. Vincent is as violent as ever, and meets no ob&s;truction capable of impeding her career. She has had another tender &s;cene with Mon&s;ieur Al|wyn; but he is made of &s;trange metal, <HI>no penetrable &s;tuff,</HI> according to her ac|count. He expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf different|ly,

and fairly owns that, if it had not been for a lucky interruption, he is fearful his pa&s;&s;ions would have vanqui&s;h|ed his re&s;olution. But he has e&s;caped, and &s;eems determined to avoid, from what he calls a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of weak|ne&s;s, &s;uch melting interviews for the future. Though I can't help laughing at his &s;tupidity, I encourage his <HI>virtuous whims,</HI> becau&s;e they an&s;wer my pur|po&s;es, every way. He wrote, the next morning, to the dying lady, who has &s;hewn me his billet. It is a mighty genteel one, full of compliments on her per&s;on and accompli&s;hments; but concludes with informing her, that his affections are unalterably fixed; and, that he is fully re&s;olved to quit Ken|dal the moment he hears any thing more about an affair, which were he to pur&s;ue, would &s;ink him, even beneath contempt.

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. Mr. STAMFORD, Jun. to Mr. ALWYN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR'S of the 24th, was brought by the &s;ervant, who conveyed my la&s;t to the po&s;t-office. Not having, at that time, any thing to communicate relating to my &s;i&s;ter, or the intended marriage, I was &s;ilent on that point. She and my father arrived here la&s;t Thur&s;day; he in good health, but poor Maria very much altered. The phy&s;icians have advi&s;|ed the country air, and my father intends to leave her for &s;ome time, as bu&s;ine&s;s requires his pre&s;ence in town, next week. Her di&s;order, it is feared, will terminate in a con&s;umption. 'Tis of the mind, and medicine vainly attempts
<PB N="47" REF="59">
to relieve, while the &s;ource of di&s;content remains. A calm languor, a &s;ettled me|lancholy has over&s;pread her features, and, I am too well convinced, will, &s;hortly, convey her to the la&s;t &s;tate of repo&s;e, if means be not found to prevent a union to which &s;he is &s;o aver&s;e.</P>
<P>INTIMATE as our friend&s;hip has ever been, I am apprehen&s;ive of &s;hocking her delicacy, if I &s;hould pre&s;s her to a di&s;covery of her pa&s;&s;ion; but I am re|&s;olved to communicate my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject to my father, who can, with much more propriety, enquire into the &s;tate of her mind. His tenderne&s;s can &s;urely never bear to &s;ee her mi&s;erable, but will rather favour her inclinations, when fixed on &s;o truly e&s;timable a cha|racter as that of my dear friend.</P>

<HEAD>Wedne&s;day Night.</HEAD>
<P>THIS morning, Mr. Maitland being deeply engaged in his &s;tudies, Maria very ill, and Tom Maitland gone a &s;hooting, my father and I were left to entertain our&s;elves; for which purpo&s;e we walked out together in one of the ad|joining woods. I had predetermined to rea&s;on with him on the &s;ubject of Maria's illne&s;s, but he prevented me by intro|ducing it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MY friend Maitland and I, &s;aid he, have long plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the hope of one day &s;eeing our families united in Maria and his &s;on. But I now begin to be apprehen&s;ive that heaven has decreed otherwi&s;e. Our inclinations are not always in our power. The cool voice of rea&s;on may put a negative on the motions of pa&s;&s;ion, if not applied to
<PB N="49" REF="61">
too late, but the will cannot cau&s;e an inclination where pa&s;&s;ion is ab&s;ent. Maria, if I can judge, di&s;likes Tom Maitland. I do not wonder at it, for I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the more I &s;ee of him, the le&s;s rea&s;on I find to admire him. The levity of his mind, which does not &s;eem &s;o much the effect of youth as of emptine&s;s, his di&s;regard of every thing &s;erious, and that want of delicacy, which appears in his ideas of dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, make me &s;u&s;pect him to be a libertine; which, if true, would be enough to make me break off the treaty, even if Maria was as &s;trongly prejudiced in his favour, as I believe &s;he is again&s;t him. But, whether that be true or not, it is &s;ufficient that he is a per&s;on with whom my child can never be happy; and, in con&s;equence, I have re&s;olved to defer their marriage till further circum|&s;tances &s;hall either confirm or refute my
<PB N="50" REF="62">
&s;u&s;picions of his real character, and the &s;tate of Maria's mind, who&s;e filial obe|dience I &s;hall never take advantage of to make her unhappy.</P>
<P>I ENTIRELY approved of his &s;enti|ments and re&s;olution, which I impart to you, that you may &s;hare the &s;atisfac|tion I find in the event. I a&s;&s;ure you I receive no &s;mall plea&s;ure in anti|cipating the time that will make you both happy; for &s;uch a time, I am per&s;uaded, will come, and that I am plea&s;ed at the thoughts of the joy the peru&s;al of this will give you.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you on the con|que&s;t you made at the a&s;&s;embly, which, to any but you, would afford either a ground for vanity, or a pro&s;pect of intere&s;t. But you are above either

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. Mi&s;s STAMFORD, to Mi&s;s GOWLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear JULIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY papa and I arrived here la&s;t night. Ever &s;ince we parted, my health has been on the decline. I am much altered, &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of your company in town. A li&s;tle&s;s dejection, which I am incapable of over|coming, has entirely &s;unk my &s;pirits, and makes every amu&s;ement tedious and di&s;gu&s;ting. Even mu&s;ic affords me no plea&s;ure, and my only con&s;olation is, that a very &s;hort time will put an end to my &s;ufferings. I am con&s;tantly haunted with the idea of Alwyn, whom my fancy repre&s;ents as pining with hopele&s;s love. Alas! perhaps I flatter
<PB N="53" REF="65">
my&s;elf, and the remembrance of Maria is, long &s;ince, blotted from his mind. I know your friend&s;hip will make you pity, and not blame, my haple&s;s in|fatuation.&mdash;And &s;ure, to die is an atone|ment &s;ufficient for my imprudence.</P>
<P>MY papa will come to town next week. He leaves me here for the be|nefit of the air, as well as for the pro|motion of that union I tremble but to think of. Young Mr. Maitland is here, but does not much trouble me with his company. I believe he thinks it is di&s;|agreeable, and I am willing he &s;hould, if that would tend to prevent our mar|riage. My dear brother is always with me. If I walk out he accompanies me, and, by the happy turn of his mind, makes the&s;e woods and lawns appear to the greate&s;t advantage. If I am con|fined to my chamber, he is continually
<PB N="54" REF="66">
there, and, by the tenderne&s;s of his be|haviour, gives me, every day, additional rea&s;ons to e&s;teem him. I &s;ee he wi&s;hes me to communicate to him the cau&s;e of my di&s;quiet, but forbears to a&s;k, le&s;t it &s;hould make me unea&s;y. And why &s;hould I not repo&s;e the &s;ecret in his faithful bo&s;om? I never had, till new, a thought that I did not &s;hare with him. He is all mildne&s;s, and I am &s;ure would rather &s;oothe than chide me.&mdash;Adieu, my dear, for the pre&s;ent. I am quite tired, and will fini&s;h this in the afternoon.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Five o'clock in the evening.</HEAD>
<P>I WALKED out, after dinner, with my brother, who &s;eemed &s;o particularly thoughtful that I could not help en|quiring the rea&s;on. You, my dear Maria, replied he, are the cau&s;e of my
<PB N="55" REF="67">
unea&s;ine&s;s. I cannot bear to &s;ee you con&s;uming with &s;ecret grief. Is it the approaching change of life you fear? Is Maitland di&s;agreeable to you? If &s;o, I am &s;ure, my father will never con&s;train your inclinations. Is it love? If it is I wi&s;h to know the &s;ecret only for your advantage; if I cannot relieve your anxiety, at lea&s;t, permit me to &s;hare it. He &s;poke this with &s;uch a tender earne&s;t|ne&s;s, and my heart was already &s;o full, that I could no longer contain my&s;elf, but bur&s;t into tears. My dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, leading me to an alcove, com|po&s;e your&s;elf. Unbo&s;om your griefs, and rely on me as your &s;incere friend; there is nothing I &s;hall not be happy to do, to re&s;tore your peace. When I had a little recovered from the agita|tion, into which his addre&s;s had thrown me, I acquainted him, without re&s;erve, with my love for Alwyn. He told me
<PB N="56" REF="68">
he had long &s;ince ob&s;erved it, and was not without hope that a future time would give Mr. Alwyn tho&s;e advan|tages his merit de&s;erves; but, that, for the pre&s;ent, he could, in confidence, a&s;|&s;ure me, that my papa was aver&s;e to making Mr. Maitland his &s;on-in-law, and had re&s;olved to break off the treaty, the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>MY joy at this agreeable intelligence was exce&s;&s;ive. I thanked him for it, with an emotion that evinced how plea&s;ing it was to me, while he en|joyed that plea&s;ure which a generous and &s;ympathetic heart receives from an occa&s;ion of exerci&s;ing its benevo|lence.</P>
<P>THE remainder of our walk was con&s;umed in di&s;cour&s;e about Mr. Al|wyn; concerning whom he told me
<PB N="57" REF="69">
&s;trange things. He is not at his mother's, as we always under&s;tood he was.&mdash;But I will relate the&s;e matters &s;ome other opportunity. I find my&s;elf much re|covered in &s;pirits &s;ince the morning. I &s;eem to my&s;elf as if ju&s;t awakened from a long dream, and, already, begin to enjoy the beauties of this enchanting re|tirement.</P>
<P>OLD Mr. Maitland has a number of particularities, but is, notwith&s;tanding, a very good man. I &s;hall have a thou|&s;and things to tell you about him when I &s;ee you. I am,</P>

<P>I HAVE not mentioned my &s;u&s;pi|cions of Maria's regard for you to my father; his di&s;inclination to the pre|&s;ent match having rendered it unnece&s;|&s;ary. Be&s;ides, I was apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, which there is no fore&s;ee|ing, in an in&s;tance of this critical nature. But I have other news to acquaint you with, that will, I am convinced, afford you much plea&s;ure. Our friend&s;hip, and the high opinion I have ever enter|tained of your honour, makes me tell you, without &s;cruple, that Maria loves you, and has confe&s;&s;ed it. No longer able to &s;ee her pining with &s;ecret angui&s;h, I pre&s;&s;ed her to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of her bo&s;om. She has owned her love,

and the apprehen&s;ions &s;he was under from the pre&s;ent treaty. I could not di&s;|approve of a pa&s;&s;ion which I have al|ways wi&s;hed to &s;ee crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; but, on the contrary, informed her that her father was really aver&s;e to conclud|ing the bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Maitland, and would take the fir&s;t opportunity of breaking it off, with honour. This a&s;|&s;urance has had a happy effect: &s;he has already began to recover her &s;pirits, and is quite another per&s;on, compared to what &s;he was a day or two ago.</P>
<P>THE gloomy appearance of affairs be|gins to clear up. Heaven, that &s;ees your mutual worth, will not &s;uffer it to langui&s;h without &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>I THOUGHT to have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you in town, pre|vious to my &s;etting out for this place; but my daughter's health, which was daily declining, obliged me to ha&s;ten my departure.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. Mr. STENTOR to his WIFE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My DEAR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE a budget of news for you. The pocket-book has been rifled, and we have made the fatal di&s;covery. I did it mighty neatly; I watched our young&s;ter's time for his long walk, which is cu&s;tomary with him every day, then went up to his room, on pretence of looking for him, but with intent to &s;ee if he had left his cabinet of &s;ecrets be|hind him; I mean his pocket-book, and had the good fortune to find it.</P>
<P>I RAN with my prize to my employer, and &s;he read, while I wrote extracts and memorandums. We were &s;o expediti|ous
<PB N="65" REF="77">
that I had replaced the book before the youth returned; and, I believe, &s;o carefully di&s;po&s;ed the papers, that it is not probable he &s;hould have any &s;u&s;|picion. It was exceedingly lucky, for I had gone &s;everal times before, when he was out, and could not find it. I am of opinion that he u&s;ually takes it with him, for it is an ob&s;ervation, made by &s;everal in the town, that he is often &s;een mu&s;ing, in the fields, over letters and papers, and the purport of what we have read con|firms the conjecture.</P>
<P>IT appears, he is in love with his ma&s;ter's daughter, with who&s;e brother he holds a corre&s;pondence. He has re|tired hither without the knowledge of his ma&s;ter, who believes him to be with a relation for the recovery of his health. The&s;e particulars known, Mrs. Vincent re&s;olved to &s;trike a bold &s;troke, and in|form
<PB N="66" REF="78">
Mr. Stamford, Alwny's ma&s;ter, of his love; but, le&s;t that &s;hould ra|ther retard than forward her &s;cheme, as, from the milky temper of the old gen|tleman, there is no knowing what turn the affair might take, &s;he has accu&s;ed him of infidelity to the young lady and love to her; and, as there was no way &s;o po&s;itive as that of &s;hewing it under Alwyn's own hand, &s;he has bribed me, rather unwillingly, I confe&s;s, to write a counterfeit love-letter, as coming from Alwyn to her. It is done in a bold &s;tile; and, as &s;he has managed the affair, cannot fail of producing the de&s;ired effect; which is, to break off all connections be|tween the Stamford family and Alwyn, for the future.</P>
<P>SHE has wrote an anonymous letter to old Stamford, and enclo&s;ed the coun|terfeit love-letter; which is &s;o happy an
<PB N="67" REF="79">
imitation, that Alwyn him&s;elf would not by the writing di&s;own it for his. You will hardly &s;uppo&s;e it was compunction for the youth that made me aver&s;e to the ta&s;k; my own, per&s;onal &s;ecurity was the only motive of any weight with me; and this kicked the beam, when put in the &s;cales of intere&s;t. I am now the proprietor of &s;ixty guineas, a &s;um that the frowns of that pre&s;ecuting bawd Fortun&egrave;, who procures only for idiots, has taught me to look up to with as much wonder, as an ignorant &s;ailor would at a gilt pagoda. Some people, perhaps, who are gravely lolling at their ea&s;e, would preach to me about con&s;cience; though, at the &s;ame time, if I wanted a mor&s;el of bread, would have the <HI>con|&s;cience</HI> to eat their dinner with a good appetite, and let me &s;tarve. The world has continually a&s;&s;aulted me, and I have a right to make repri&s;als; all men that I
<PB N="68" REF="80">
have ever heard of agree, that &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation precedes every other con&s;ide|ration; it does, however, with me. This Alwyn came here, and deprived me of my bread, at lea&s;t of my fame; and mu&s;t I be the pimp to his triumph, let him look to him&s;elf, he is mi&s;taken in his man, if he imagines me &s;o fooli&s;hly tame.</P>
<P>I HAVE another rod in pickle for him; I told you I would take mea&s;ures to inform Mr. Staple, the lover of Mrs. Vincent, what a rapid progre&s;s the youth has made in the affections of his mi&s;tre&s;s. I have accompli&s;hed this bu&s;ine&s;s, and it has had that kind of effect which I &s;up|po&s;ed. Staple is bent upon mi&s;chief and revenge, but he is none of your fooli&s;h hot-headed blockheads, who, becau&s;e they have received an injury, &s;eek &s;atisfacti|on in what is ridiculou&s;ly called an <HI>ho|nourable
<PB N="69" REF="81">
way.</HI> He is aware, that the armour of honour was never yet found to be bullet-proof. He, therefore, goes me a wi&s;er way to work, and hires me two or three &s;tout fellows, who are to be|&s;tow the knout, or the ba&s;tinado, or &s;ome, equally mild, di&s;cipline upon him; nay, perhaps, proceed a little farther, if there &s;hould &s;eem a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a pro|cedure. My emi&s;&s;ary, who tells me all this, is to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant and Ward, the Town Bully, who, you know, is the terror of the Kendalians, the captain of the Blackguards, and the leading man at elections, is another. They are to be re|inforced by Staple, and their plan is to hide them&s;elves among the rocks, where he u&s;ually re&s;orts; one of them is to be upon the &s;cout, and give notice of his arrival; they are then to &s;teal upon him, unawares, knock him down, if he makes any re&s;i&s;tance, bind him, and puni&s;h
<PB N="70" REF="82">
him as their leader &s;hall direct. They are provided with di&s;gui&s;es, and intend to leave him bound, after they have broken a few of his bones. I hope there will be no murder; becau&s;e, I confe&s;s, that would be carrying even <HI>my</HI> revenge too far. Not that I would have them tender upon the &s;ubject. If he keeps his bed three weeks, or a month, he will find we &s;hall be able to play without him; and our booby of a manager will be obliged, then, to come cap-in-hand, once more, to me.</P>
<P>I CAN never mention this la&s;t fool without recollecting &s;ome of his ab|&s;urdities. He wants to have Shylock, the Jew, in the Merchant of Venice, &s;poken in the dialect of Duke's-place, and &s;wears <HI>Shak&s;pur</HI> intended it &s;o. He is &s;eldom perfect enough in his part to be able to repeat two lines together,
<PB N="71" REF="83">
without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the prompter; and, when he blunders, always lays the blame upon others.</P>
<P>YOU know what a happy knack he has at mutilating. The other night, in&s;tead of <HI>angels,</HI> he wanted <HI>anglers</HI> to vi&s;it his Cordelia's dreams.</P>
<P>HE told the duke in Othello, a me&s;|&s;enger was arrived from the <HI>gallows,</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>gallies.</HI></P>

<P>HE &s;eemed in an excellent mood in this play, for di&s;covering his talent;
<PB N="72" REF="84">
for, when he &s;hould have &s;aid to Cloten, <Q>Attend you here, the door of our &s;tern daughter?</Q> he a&s;ked, <Q>Attend you here, our daughter's &s;tern door?</Q> &mdash;But this to you, who are &s;o well acquainted with the booby, is &s;uper|fluous.&mdash;Adieu,</P>

<P>THAT you may not &s;u&s;pect me of having any private pique, any &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, or mean re&s;entment to gratify, I have &s;ent &s;ufficient proof of the charge I make. The enclo&s;ed letter, addre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="87">
to me, under his own hand, is an irre|fragable witne&s;s. His ingratitude in of|fering to expo&s;e the letters of his friend, your &s;on, for which he had no rea&s;on, but to convince me that your daughter was, as he termed it, dying for him, put me beyond all patience. Not that I am &s;urprized at the young lady's par|tiality in his favour; he has many &s;pe|cious qualities, and art enough to en|&s;nare the affections of an inexperienced heart, e&s;pecially one, who&s;e own recti|tude will not let it mi&s;tru&s;t the &s;incerity of others. Before I was aware of his character, or intentions, I &s;uffered him to vi&s;it at my hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of the protection his plau&s;ibility had gained him among the young gentlemen of Kendal; and &s;uppo&s;ing him, from what ob&s;ervations a fir&s;t, or &s;econd interview had furni&s;hed me with, de&s;erving of bet|ter fortune than his connexion with a
<PB N="76" REF="88">
company of travelling players could af|ford. I am &s;orry, &s;ince, by his own ac|count, you have an intere&s;t in his welfare, that I was &s;o &s;oon obliged to alter my opinion. Indeed I did not imagine that, becau&s;e I treated him with re&s;pect, he would, therefore, declare him&s;elf my lover; nor, when I found him &s;o auda|cious, that he would, by &s;uch ungenerous means as tho&s;e of pretending to &s;acri|fice another, and, perhaps, far more de|&s;erving lady, to me, endeavour to re|commend him&s;elf to my favour.</P>
<P>I DO not mean to write a di&s;&s;ertation upon his conduct; but as I have, from what I deem proper motives, undertaken to inform you of it, I thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to give my rea&s;ons for &s;o doing. His letter will be&s;t direct your feelings, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;charg|ed my duty will &s;atisfy mine.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="89">I SHOULD have &s;ub&s;cribed my name, but that I think it a di&s;grace to have any future knowledge of &s;uch an affair, and would avoid all tran&s;actions, of every kind, hereafter, with Mr. Alwyn; neither is there any nece&s;&s;ity, where the circum|&s;tances are &s;o full and obvious.

<P>WHY will you &s;uffer the humble&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;incere of your adorers, to langui&s;h in de&s;pair? The repul&s;e you, la&s;t night, gave my ardent and ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion has, almo&s;t, de|prived me of rea&s;on. Why, too cruel fair, do you delight in the mi&s;ery of your faithful &s;lave? Yet, why do I complain? Had I ten thou&s;and lives, I would &s;urrender them, in obedience to your commands. Suffer me to hope for an abatement of your rigour.</P>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible that my pa&s;&s;ion can be a matter of &s;urprize to you? To
<PB N="79" REF="91">
you, who are formed to in&s;pire the mo&s;t ardent love? Can you reproach me with ba&s;ene&s;s, in &s;acrificing another to the in|fluence of your matchle&s;s charms? Is not your irre&s;i&s;tible beauty an excu&s;e for a breach, even of the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn engagements? Ah, cea&s;e, angelic creature, to blame me for the effects of a pa&s;&s;ion that is too &s;trong for op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, I was, once, &s;lightly en|amoured with a girl; but never knew the force of love, till I beheld your unrivall'd perfections. She was the gen|tleman's daughter with whom I re&s;ided in London; but &s;he was forward, and I was fooli&s;h. It was a &s;illy affair that, I was apprehen&s;ive, might become too &s;erious; for which rea&s;on, I pretended that my health was declining, and made that excu&s;e to avoid a per&s;ecution from
<PB N="80" REF="92">
the poor thing, who, I found, expected me to tie an Hymeneal knot with her, to which, till this in&s;tant, I have ever had the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder that I now feel my&s;elf all love, all con&s;tancy, all ec&s;tacy and truth. Who can think of another that looks upon you?</P>
<P>TO convince you of my &s;incerity, I will &s;hew you, this evening, extracts, or whole letters if you plea&s;e, from the brother of the above lady, from which it will appear how ea&s;ily I might &s;ucceed, were fortune the only object of my pur|&s;uit. Do but look with pity on my pa&s;|&s;ion, and I will in&s;tantly let this brother know how much he is mi&s;taken, when he fancies I love his &s;i&s;ter; which I &s;hould have done long ago, but for &s;ome pru|dential rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="93">I AM unhappy till I hear my doom from your dear lips; and, &s;urely, if they pronounce it, I cannot doubt its kind|ne&s;s. They were formed for plea&s;ure, and cannot, twice, give pain.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. Mr. ALWYN to Mr. HILKIRK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HILKIRK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits which I labour under, an adventure has happened to me, which has &s;urprized me &s;o much, that I find an impul&s;e &s;trong enough to make me thus &s;oon re&s;ume my pen, and &s;end you an account of it.</P>
<P>THE romantic &s;cenes which are &s;o numerous in this country, being ex|ceedingly delightful, and in uni&s;on with that kind of temper, which I, more particularly at pre&s;ent, po&s;&s;e&s;s, it had become cu&s;tomary with me to ramble
<PB N="83" REF="95">
among them, u&s;ually, every day. This I find has been taken notice of.</P>
<P>WANDERING, this morning, by the &s;ide of a rivulet, my accu&s;tomed haunt, that wa&s;hes a thou&s;and rocky fragments, and is kept in almo&s;t perpetual agitation by the ob&s;truction it meets with, I ob|&s;erved a natural cave, in a rock upon its bank, which had a winding, narrow entrance. The warmth of the day, the gloom of the cavern, and my inclina|tion for repo&s;e, all invited me to re&s;t, and I &s;at down in it. Appearances made me conjecture this had, heretofore, been the &s;ilent retreat of &s;ome one, who, like me, was devoted to melancholy. In the &s;pot that fronted it the bed of the brook was deep, and its waters un|ruffled; within was a &s;eat upon the &s;helving of the rock, a little worn, where one might recline, un&s;een, and
<PB N="84" REF="96">
li&s;ten to the warblings of the inhabi|tants of the lonely valley. The light, through &s;everal cavities, ju&s;t found &s;uf|ficient entrance to enable me to read; the roof permitted me to &s;it, or &s;tand, upright, and I began to regret that I had not &s;ooner di&s;covered a place &s;o con&s;onant to my ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I HAD amu&s;ed my&s;elf, here, for &s;ome time, when I heard the voices of men; and, as I had no de&s;ire to be &s;een, I &s;at &s;till, &s;uppo&s;ing they would &s;oon be pa&s;t. They approached nearer, and their language became di&s;tinct. Judge of my &s;urprize, when I found my&s;elf the &s;ubject of the following conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><Q>DAMN him, I'll be the death of him&mdash;I'll murder him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHOY, if we murder him, he'll
<PB N="85" REF="97">
be &s;ure never to foind us out; dead men, you know, tell no tales.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NO, no, I'll ha no con&s;arn in mur|der, noather. Yow &s;ay he has affront|ed you; and if yow want to be even with him, by giving him a good, &s;ound beating, why &s;o, I'll lend you a hond, an I think he'll &s;carce be an overmatch for us aw three.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AW three! dom thee for a coward, whoy I, my&s;el, would &s;pin him tween my finger and thum, loike a two-penny top. An, I &s;uppooas, if we were to give him two or three hard knucks, that &s;hould chance to do his bu&s;ine&s;s, thou a&s;t &s;ich a queeazy con&s;cience thou'd&s;t peach.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NO&mdash;dom the liars.&mdash;But, how&s;om|dever, I doan't ought to be con&s;arn'd in his death, cau&s;e he gum me a
<PB N="86" REF="98">
guinea to pay my quarter's rent, and boy my woife a pare a-&s;hoon, t'other day; and which, thou know&s;t, thou holp me &s;pend, cau&s;e my landlord, here, promi&s;ed to forgee me th'rent, and &s;umat be&s;ide, for this job.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AYE, aye&mdash;I'll forgive thee th'rent, provided thou do&s;t not &s;pare his bones; for by &mdash; I'll &s;carce leave life in him&mdash;I'll teach him to come to a&s;&s;emblies, and dance with other folks mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, an make love out of play|books; damn him, I'll 'noint his carca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AS &s;oon as we &s;ee him cumin, we'll put creeap o'er our feaces, and hoide till we can fall on him; and then, if we think he kens us, wee&s;t coot his tongue out, to mar his telling who hurt him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="99"><Q>HIS tongue! what matters his tongue, he can write, can he not?&mdash;I'll warrant he can write love-letters&mdash; Make an end of him, damn him, make an end of him&mdash;I'd &s;tick my knife to his heart, for a farthing. I'd kill him with a better heart than ever a butcher kill'd a calf.</Q></P>
<P>FROM two or three circum&s;tances in their di&s;cour&s;e it was that I di&s;covered my&s;elf to be the &s;ubject of it. I looked through an aperture of the rock, and perceived they were armed with &s;hort bludgeons, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, they had precaution enough to hide under their coats, while they thought there was any danger of being &s;een; and, con&s;ider|ing the intentions and &s;trength of the enemy, I concluded my&s;elf happy in being thus &s;ecreted from their &s;ight. This, however, was no &s;ecurity; they
<PB N="88" REF="100">
were acquainted with the place; and one of them perceiving &s;omebody coming, along the winding of the valley, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be me, they proceeded to enter the cave. What added to the horror of my &s;ituation, was, that their leader, being intent upon an evil action, and &s;ubject, I &s;uppo&s;e, to a thou&s;and ap|prehen&s;ions, drew a large knife, and was the fir&s;t that approached the cavern.</P>
<P>THE moment I beheld my enemy ad|vancing, my anger at the perfidious manner in which he &s;ought revenge, for a &s;uppo&s;ed injury of which I was inno|cent, added to the abhorrence of being murdered, made me forget all fear, and darting from my &s;eat, I &s;eized the knife, and with one effort laid him at my feet. The guilt of his con&s;cience, and my unexpected appearance and a&s;&s;ault, ter|rified him &s;o much, that, in&s;tead of
<PB N="89" REF="101">
giving any proofs of ferocity, he roared for mercy in the mo&s;t abject manner.</P>
<P>I DID not &s;tay any longer with him, but, &s;natching his club, attacked his a&s;|&s;ociates, and, by a &s;ucce&s;sful blow, level|led one of them with the earth. The more de&s;perate talker, and him who was &s;o ready to accu&s;e the other of cowardice, took to his heels. He did not e&s;cape thus; I &s;prang over the fallen a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and pur&s;ued him, and his foot tripping, I caught him almo&s;t in&s;tantly. He ro&s;e, and endeavoured to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;t|ance, but I had the good fortune to prove victorious.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;carce made this conque&s;t, when I perceived young Mr. We&s;twood, with his fi&s;hing rod; who &s;eeing me thus engaged,
<PB N="90" REF="102">
ran, immediately, to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I de|&s;ired him to guard this ruffian, while I went to &s;ecure Mr. Staple, the leader of this glorious enterprize: the other a&s;&s;ociate, I perceived, had fled out of my reach, and has not been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>AS I came to the cavern, I heard Staple groan, &s;hockingly; I, therefore, de&s;ired Mr. We&s;twood to come up, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me in bringing him from the mouth of the cave, he being ju&s;t in that part of it where there was not light enough to di&s;cover in what condition he was: ac|cordingly, having bound the other with a rope, which was tied round his own wai&s;t, and which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was intended for my u&s;e, we went to Staple, who con|tinued utttering groans, and exclaimed that he was a dead man.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="103">WHEN we had brought him to the light, we found he had a contu&s;ion on the eye, which, from the violence of the blow, had &s;welled, prodigiou&s;ly; but, what was wor&s;e, in falling, his arm was broken, by pitching in the crevice of a rock.</P>
<P>I NOW found all my anger turned to pity, and, therefore, forebore to upbraid him. I was not inclined to be quite &s;o merciful to the accomplice. I knew if I accu&s;ed him before a magi&s;trate the af|fair mu&s;t become public; I, therefore, be|&s;towed a little di&s;cipline upon him, though not quite to the &s;atisfaction of Mr. We&s;twood, and &s;uffered him to depart.</P>
<P>WE conveyed Staple almo&s;t to Ken|dal, in the be&s;t manner we were able;
<PB N="92" REF="104">
and he made &s;o many mean conce&s;&s;ions, and begged of me to forgive him &s;o often, that I told him he might invent what tale he plea&s;ed, and tell it his own way, for that I &s;hould not contradict it; and prevailed, at la&s;t, on We&s;twood to make the like promi&s;e; accordingly, I hear, he reports that he has been robbed and ill treated by a thief, among the mountains.</P>
<P>JEALOUSY, it &s;eems, prompted him to commit this outrage; I had danced with his mi&s;tre&s;s at an a&s;&s;embly, and &s;he has been unkind to him &s;ince, which he attributes to her partiality for me; but, as I have by no means encouraged her in &s;uch a partiality, I am not to be ac|countable for her caprice; however, as it is an affair that I did not wi&s;h to hear any thing about in the pre&s;ence of Mr. We&s;twood, I did not a&s;k for any explan|ation,
<PB N="93" REF="105">
nor did he offer any, unle&s;s his apologies for his conduct may be &s;o termed.</P>
<P>I AM not &s;o violently attached to my pre&s;ent employment as I imagined I &s;hould be. There is &s;o much of the labour of a &s;chool-boy requi&s;ite, that, before the words are learnt by rote, the imagination is wearied, the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic fire, which the fir&s;t reading of the poet in&s;pires, is evaporated, and the fancy becomes jaded by repetition. The fal&s;e, or dull conception, too, of the ge|nerality of the performers, is exceedingly teizing. I do not think to continue here, long, and the above adventure will rather quicken than retard my departure. I have flattering accounts from young Mr. Stamford, that would almo&s;t make me think of returning to the family.
<PB N="94" REF="106">
My heart is with them, but I dare not indulge my hopes: &s;hould they prove fal&s;e, it would only increa&s;e a di&s;order that is, already, too violent. Adieu.</P>

<P>IF I were con&s;cious of having ever acted, in the lea&s;t re&s;pect, otherwi&s;e to you than as a father, I &s;hould have been le&s;s &s;urprized at the tran&s;action that compels me to trouble you with this. Your father was the worthie&s;t of men, and the thought that I was repay|ing, in a &s;light degree, the obligation I owe to his friend&s;hip, added to the merit, I fancied, I &s;aw in you, gave me a &s;atisfaction, that more than amply counterbalanced the benefits you re|ceived from my protection and care. I can never expre&s;s the plea&s;ure I daily experienced, in beholding the image of

<P>THINK, Alwyn, if your &s;oul is not grown callous to every &s;entiment, to every feeling that dignifies mankind&mdash; Think what I &s;uffer in relinqui&s;hing the darling wi&s;h.

I can ill afford to lo&s;e the ble&s;|&s;ing; but perfect felicity is not attain|able in this life, and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I &s;ubmit with pain and reluctance.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="109">OH, Alwyn, much rather would I have followed thee to the grave than &s;een the proofs of ye&s;terday! When did I injure you? What has Maria done? Ba&s;e, ungrateful wretch!

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HILKIRK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM overwhelmed with misfortunes, I have received a letter, a fatal one to me, that informs me, I have totally lo&s;t the friend&s;hip of the Stamford family. I am unacquainted with the cau&s;e, and bewildered in amazement and &s;orrow. It is wrote by Mr. Stamford, &s;enior, and complains bitterly and pathetically of my ingratitude. Nothing could add to my unhappine&s;s but a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. God only knows my heart, and how much I would undertake to &s;erve, or convince them of my affection, or how indu&s;triou&s;ly I would avoid injur|ing, or giving them pain. I am accu&s;ed
<PB N="104" REF="116">
of breach of friend&s;hip, and want of love and delicacy for Maria, but in &s;uch a vague and enigmatical, though po&s;&s;i|tive &s;tile, that I am at a lo&s;s in what manner to interpret it. Perhaps the old gentleman is offended at my becoming a comedian, without informing him of my intention. Yet &s;urely this offence could not merit, nor authorize the ac|cu&s;ations I have received.</P>
<P>THE more I reflect, the more I am &s;urprized and afflicted. Mr. Stamford is cautious, to a degree, how he believes any thing to the di&s;advantage of another; and, when convinced, is ever ready to make the mo&s;t generous allowances for the infirmities of human nature. He has found out my love for his daughter, perhaps: this, doubtle&s;s, is di&s;agreeable to him; but I am certain, this, nor no
<PB N="105" REF="117">
other motive could induce him to &s;werve from the path of integrity; nothing but po&s;itive conviction could make him accu&s;e me in the manner he has done, and yet it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have that. What can be the cau&s;e? I have no enmity to any one. I ob&s;truct no one in his pro&s;pects of hap|pine&s;s or plea&s;ure. I am not of im|portance enough, in this ambitious world, to annoy any one, &s;ufficiently to make him my enemy: or, if I were, who could give malice a colour &s;trong enough to convince the good, the generous Stamfords, of the reality of my &s;uppo&s;ed guilt? It is the utmo&s;t weakne&s;s to har|bour &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, and nothing but my pre&s;ent incertitude and di&s;tre&s;s could excu&s;e me in making &s;uch reflections.</P>
<P>I HAVE wrote to Mr. Stamford, junior, but, as I am certain of the ju&s;tice of his

father's proceedings, and how thorough|ly he believes him&s;elf convinced of the truth of his a&s;&s;ertions (by what &s;trange means I know nor) I expect only a further confirmation of my mi&s;|fortunes. &mdash; Oh Maria! &mdash; Forgive me dear Hilkirk &mdash; my tears will not let me proceed.</P>
<P>I COULD not fini&s;h this letter ye&s;terday. I found my&s;elf &s;o ill, and my brain &s;o near a &s;tate of frenzy, that I was obliged to u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to calm my di&s;turbed imagination. I am little better to day. I have received a letter, from young Mr. Stamford, in an&s;wer to mine, that thoroughly confirms my prediction. The thing that I am mo&s;t unea&s;y at, is, they have not told me what their allegations are founded on. Per|haps the explanation is what they &s;eek
<PB N="107" REF="119">
to avoid; and I will rather &s;uffer in &s;ilence, than urge them to any thing that would give them pain. It is enough for me that I am innocent. I &s;hall &s;oon have no remembrance of injuries, or the injured. I find my&s;elf in the road that leads to everla&s;ting re&s;t, and this, only, is my hope, my con&s;olation. It is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the only object that could make the &s;mall remain|der of time, my youth might promi&s;e, glide away in tranquillity and joy; and, &s;urely, to be relea&s;ed from mi&s;ery is a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I SHALL quit this place directly, and travel, on foot, acro&s;s the country to my dear mother in Oxford&s;hire. I am daily receiving proofs of her maternal tender|ne&s;s, and I wi&s;h to die in her arms; I &s;hall endeavour to hide my griefs from

<P>WHY do you continue to laugh at us? You cannot, &s;urely, pre|tend to &s;ay that my father's letter is enigmatical to you. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to inform you by what means we re|ceived the intelligence of your perfidy: it is enough that you cannot but be con&s;cious of having betrayed your friend; and that in the point on which the peace of our family, in a great mea&s;ure, mu&s;t depend.</P>
<P>YOUR proceedings are di&s;covered. You can, therefore, have no end to &s;erve; and an attempt to deceive mu&s;t, now, be the effect of mere wantonne&s;s.
<PB N="110" REF="122">
But the peace of families is not a thing to be &s;ported with; e&s;pecially after &s;uch tran&s;actions as have pa&s;&s;ed between you and us. It hurts me to be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of noticing this, which nothing, but the &s;hamefulne&s;s of your behaviour, could have forced from me: but, to prevent any corre&s;pondence on &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ubject, I am to inform you that my father and my&s;elf de&s;ire to have no farther connexion with, or application from you; and that Maria is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trength of mind enough to blot from her remembrance &s;o un|worthy a character.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Mr. MAITLAND, Junior, to STAFFORD OSBORNE, E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear OSBORNE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much concerned to find that your letter, in an&s;wer to my two long ones, is not come to hand; and can at|tribute it to no other rea&s;on than <HI>its not being yet wrote.</HI> If that is the ca&s;e, I mu&s;t make bold to inform you, that I &s;hall not turn hi&s;torian <HI>gratis</HI> but &s;hall expect an ample return for the narratives I tran&s;mit to you from time to time. But I don't believe I &s;hall trouble you with many, while I continue in this place. We hold &s;carce any &s;ublunary intelligence. I could favour you with an account of the number of patches the &s;un had on his face when he ro&s;e this
<PB N="112" REF="124">
morning, or let you know the length of Venus's horns; which, by the bye, &s;hews how different the mode in that country is from ours. I &s;hould have ex|pected to have &s;een the patches upon Venus, and the horns upon Mars.</P>
<P>BUT, if the&s;e &s;ublime di&s;qui&s;itions are above your comprehen&s;ion, you are to know that we are not always <HI>&s;uper ethera.</HI> We have a hen or two that are con&s;tantly employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though we are not &s;anguine enough to hope we &s;hall ever arrive at the art of making chickens, yet, we think much may be done by way of meliorating the &s;pecies. My father thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed <HI>u&s;que ab ovo,</HI> on account of a difficulty he found, la&s;t winter, in attempting to produce hair, in&s;tead of feathers, on their bodies. To accompli&s;h which de&s;irable effect, they were dive&s;ted of their natural habili|ments,
<PB N="113" REF="125">
and kept, for &s;ome weeks, in a room, on a gra&s;s diet; a regimen that is &s;aid to have produced the &s;ame phaeno|menon in the per&s;on of king Nebuchad|nezzar. But whether to the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on, which prevented the ex|periment &s;ucceeding &s;o well here as at Babylon, or to what other cau&s;e the failure might be attributed, certain it is, that they all died, ju&s;t at the time when there was all the rea&s;on in the world to expect a favourable conclu&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE are misfortunes, you'll &s;ay, and &s;o they are; but we bear them with philo&s;ophic re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>MY father has made a capital ac|qui&s;ition in young Stamford, who ac|companies him in all his projects and enquiries; and I a&s;&s;i&s;t, very often, for want of better employment.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="126">A LITTLE below our hou&s;e, on the other &s;ide of the river, the bank ri&s;es with an a&s;cent, rather &s;teep, and is co|vered with hazle and other trees.

The other night we were all three &s;tanding on the bank, when a particularly brilliant one made its appearance. My father, who is very active for his years, &s;kipped from &s;tone to &s;tone, and was on the other &s;ide in a trice. Mr. Stamford followed; and I, not willing to be &s;ingular, went after; but my evil genius had &s;o contrived it that, &s;tepping on a &s;mooth &s;tone, I &s;lip|ped into the water over head and ears. This &s;udden immer&s;ion effectually cooled the ardour of our pur&s;uit, Stamford helped me out with &s;ome trepidation;
<PB N="115" REF="127">
and my father, returning, a&s;&s;ured me, that my misfortune was entirely owing to a due equilibrium of the center not being pre&s;erved. However happy this elucida|tion might be, I did not find my&s;elf di&s;|po&s;ed to admire it, but walked home, ra|ther out of temper, re&s;olving to &s;et his philo&s;ophical acumen to work on other bu&s;ine&s;s. For which purpo&s;e I ordered Sam to accommodate my dog Pompey in the &s;tile of an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> and lead him about the lower grove at the time my father generally repairs to his ob&s;er|vatory. He, accordingly, fixed &s;ix &s;mall lamps to a kind of &s;addle, which he fa&s;t|ened to the dog's back, and made a mo&s;t &s;hining appearance.</P>
<P>GADSO, &s;ays my father, turning the large, reflecting tele&s;cope towards it, a very peculiar kind of meteor!</P>

<P>OUR pur&s;uit la&s;ted full two hours, at the end of which we pre&s;&s;ed Sam and his meteor &s;o hard that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of extingui&s;hing his illumina|tions, which, of cour&s;e, obliged us to return home un&s;atisfied.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. Mr. STAMFORD, Sen. to Mr. SELDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A TERRIBLE accident has pre|vented my coming to town this week, as I intended. Maitland-hall is burnt to the ground. Happily, no lives were lo&s;t; but Mr. Maitland has &s;uf|fered very much in his property, to the amount of, nearly, all he was worth. The fire began in his elaboratory, by Tom Maitland's means, but in what particu|lar manner I have not yet had time to enquire.</P>
<P>ABOUT one o'clock in the morning we were alarmed by a neighbour, who was providentially cro&s;&s;ing a foot-path that leads by the hou&s;e. I &s;tarted up, imme|diately,
<PB N="122" REF="134">
but the &s;uffocating &s;moke, with which my chamber was filled, overpower|ed my &s;en&s;es, and I fell, again, on the bed. What followed I was uncon&s;cious of, but, about an hour after, I found my&s;elf in a chamber at the vicar's, and Charles &s;itting be&s;ide me.</P>
<P>THE idea of the fire was &s;till predo|minant in my mind; but I was unable to determine whether I had dreamt, or the misfortune had really happened. Where am I, exclaimed I, where's my Maria? Let me know, Charles, is my poor child lo&s;t? How came I here? Compo&s;e your&s;elf, dear Sir, replied he, Maria is &s;afe, a &s;tranger pre&s;erved her life at the ri&s;que of his own.</P>
<P>AND where is this heavenly &s;tranger? Bring him to me. Let me at lea&s;t ac|knowledge the debt, &s;ince I never can
<PB N="123" REF="135">
repay it. He knows not the value of the ble&s;&s;ing he has be&s;towed. But tell me, Charles, how all this happened. I re|member the alarm of fire, when the &s;moke overcame me, but have no know|ledge of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I WAS rouzed, &s;aid he, by the out|cries of the &s;ervants, and the thought of your danger ru&s;hed, in&s;tantly, into my mind. I flew to your chamber, one &s;ide of which the flames had already &s;eized. The urgency of the occa&s;ion gave me a &s;trength, which, at another time, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have exerted. I &s;eized you in my arms, and conveyed you hither. When my terror and apprehen&s;ions, for your &s;afety, were, &s;omewhat, &s;ub&s;ided, I recol|lected Maria, and, in the utmo&s;t angui&s;h, ha&s;tened back to the &s;cene of de&s;olation. Two of Mr. Moreton's &s;ervants, accom|panied
<PB N="124" REF="136">
by my man Will, were bringing her to this place, in a chair. My dear Will, &s;aid I, in a tran&s;port, how can I reward you for &s;aving my &s;i&s;ter. <Q>No, Sir,</Q> replied he, <Q>it was not I. It was an angel that &s;natched her from the middle of the fire; for, to be &s;ure, he was &s;ent by heaven to &s;ave my mi&s;tre&s;s. The roof fell in the moment after. I a&s;ked him to &s;tay, but he would not, he went away towards next town</Q>. Will is now gone, by my order, to intreat him to return.</P>
<P>WHILE Charles was &s;peaking, his &s;ervant entered the room.</P>
<P>"HE won't come," &s;aid Will, <Q>he won't come. I told him my ma&s;ter long'd to &s;ee him, but he hung his head, and &s;ighed as if he would break his heart. Poor, young gentleman!
<PB N="125" REF="137">
I thought, mayhap, he believed &s;ome|body was burnt; &s;o I told him all was &s;afe, and that 'Squire Maitland was &s;afe, and you, Sir was &s;afe, and every body was &s;afe; but, for all that, he would not &s;peak. At la&s;t he &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible, and that he was a wretch, and had lo&s;t all his friends, but that he hoped he &s;hould die &s;oon, and forget his mi&s;eries. And &s;o I be|lieve he will, for he looked &s;o pale, and &s;o thin, and his eyes were &s;o hol|low, that my heart aches to think of it. I could not help crying, when he walked away, he &s;eemed &s;o di&s;con&s;o|late. What a pity he &s;hould be &s;ad or &s;orry! I wi&s;h I could help him! I'd go to the end of the world to help him.</Q></P>
<P>POOR Will's heart was full. He could not proceed; and Charles, who
<PB N="126" REF="138">
had &s;at, &s;ilent, with the tears in his eyes, &s;eemed lo&s;t in the &s;ympathy of his af|fections.</P>
<P><Q>MERCIFUL heaven, exclaimed he, ri&s;ing, are the &s;evere&s;t calamities re|&s;erved for thy favourites! O that he had returned! How happy we &s;hould have been to have &s;upplied the place of his lo&s;t friends, and alleviated his &s;orrows!</Q></P>
<P>TO prevent his dwelling on an object which afflicted him, without being of &s;ervice to our benefactor, I de&s;ired him to enquire how Mr. Maitland and his &s;on did, while I ro&s;e and went to Ma|ria. She was &s;itting in the arms of Mi&s;s Moreton, and her maid, who, with &s;ome difficulty, kept her in bed.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="139">"WHERE's my papa?" Cried &s;he, &s;truggling, <Q>you would let me &s;ee him if he were &s;afe. No, no, he is dead, and I will die too. We will go to|gether.</Q></P>
<P>"MY child," &s;aid I, &s;itting down, be&s;ide her, <Q>look at me, I have e&s;caped the flames.</Q></P>
<P>"IS it true?" Replied &s;he, looking at me with great earne&s;tne&s;s,&mdash; <Q>no, you deceive me, you are not my papa.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ea&s;onable flood of tears en&s;ued, which re&s;tored her &s;o much that &s;he knew me, and enquired after Charles. I related the particulars of the event, as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, and, advi&s;ing her to re&s;t, left her in the care of Mi&s;s Moreton.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="140">I, THEN, walked to the &s;ite, on which Maitland-hall had &s;tood, where I found Mr. Maitland and Charles &s;urveying the ruins. From the compo&s;ure which ap|peared in the countenance of my old friend, I did not apprehend his lo&s;s to exceed that of the hou&s;e and furniture; but, on enquiry, he informed me his &s;trong box, containing notes and &s;ecu|rities for upwards of fifty thou&s;and pounds, being almo&s;t all he was worth, was mi&s;&s;ing. But, &s;aid he, to a philo&s;o|pher, this is of little con&s;equence. I can bound my appetites, and enough is left. If I lo&s;e my tranquillity, it will be a greater lo&s;s than that I have ju&s;t now &s;u&s;tained. Tom mu&s;t choo&s;e one of the profe&s;&s;ions to live by; and it is not im|po&s;&s;ible but the employment of rai&s;ing a fortune, may prove much more inno|cent than that of &s;pending one.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="141">I TOOK this occa&s;ion to tell him, that I had no intention of breaking off the treaty, on account of the alteration this misfortune would make in his &s;on's circum&s;tances; and he, in an&s;wer, &s;aid, he expected no le&s;s, from the confidence he repo&s;ed in my integrity. When I con&s;ider the &s;incerity of his friend&s;hip to me, and the proofs he has given me of it, I cannot bear the thought of refu&s;ing my daughter, at this time. It carries with it a mark of ba&s;ene&s;s not to be endured. Perhaps, this di&s;a&s;ter may give a new turn to Tom's mind, and make him more worthy of my girl. If &s;o, all will be well, and this &s;hocking cir|cum&s;tance will bet productive of good. I hope to hear that your affairs go on to your &s;atisfaction, and am, with perfect e&s;teem, Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear HILKIRK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED at my dear mother's this day week, and, if I were ca|pable of plea&s;ure, &s;hould receive it from the joy and tenderne&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, and her a&s;&s;iduity to make me hap|py.&mdash;You can &s;carce imagine what my feelings are, or what &s;uch a mother de&s;erves. I am afraid &s;he &s;hould re|mark the gloom that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my mind. I know how much it would di&s;tre&s;s her. I, therefore, make very &s;evere &s;truggles to &s;mother my &s;ighs, and am re&s;olved, as much as is in my power, to carry my griefs abroad, and, without a figure, complain to the pitile&s;s winds.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="144">MY life &s;eems fruitful in adventures, and &s;trange incidents. I am, at this moment, oppre&s;&s;ed and agitated with the recollection of one, which has hap|pened to me on my journey. I know you will excu&s;e my impertinence in continually talking thus of my&s;elf. I am not, at pre&s;ent, in a &s;tate of &s;uffi|cient tranquillity to make ob&s;ervations on objects which u&s;ed to amu&s;e me. I find my&s;elf, at moments, not many de|grees from in&s;anity; and the affliction this would co&s;t my mother, even more than the horror attending it, makes me u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavour to forget my troubles, and ward off the blow. My efforts, I fear, will be ineffectual; though, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have tried every method. I read, I run, I walk, and make various efforts, to divert my ideas from the channel in which they &s;o con|&s;tantly flow. My mother appears di&s;|tru&s;tful,
<PB N="133" REF="145">
at times; tells me how fre|quently I talk in an incoherent man|ner, e&s;pecially in the night; and I have caught my&s;elf, more than once, &s;inging, aloud, without any meaning. I hope, however, I &s;hall conquer this di&s;po&s;ition. &mdash;Could I forget Maria!&mdash;Alas!&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Oh, memory!&mdash;Oh, Ma|ria!&mdash;</P>
<P>I WILL endeavour to tell my &s;tory; Maria has a part in it.</P>
<P>I DEPARTED from Kendal, on the day, and in the manner that I had pro|po&s;ed. I travelled four days without being, &s;carcely, able to recollect, whether I had pa&s;&s;ed through towns or villages, had met men, women, or other objects, except &s;uch as immediate nece&s;&s;ity had obliged me to notice; and was walking very late on the fifth, I &s;uppo&s;e it might
<PB N="134" REF="146">
be almo&s;t midnight; for I knew the country, and was &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that I did not think of re&s;t; when, ca&s;t|ing my eyes accidentally up, at the noi&s;e of an owl, that flew by me, with a di&s;|mal howl, I perceived, at a le&s;s di&s;tance than a quarter of a mile from the road|&s;ide, a hou&s;e in flames. I had forgot, at that moment, where I was; but made the be&s;t of my way towards the place. The &s;hrieks of the people were piercing, and made the natural &s;tillne&s;s of the night awfully &s;hocking. It was ex|ceedingly dark, and the wind rather tempe&s;tuous, with a &s;harp cutting rain; while the blaze ca&s;t a horrid gleam upon every object around. I don't remember to have ever been &s;truck with &s;o much terror. I ran, I flew, I intermixed with the frightened &s;ufferers, who were running to and fro, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and, I thought,
<PB N="135" REF="147">
I &s;aw, by the pale glare, &s;ome faces that I knew.</P>
<P>IMAGINE what my &s;en&s;ations were, when I beheld a young gentleman bear|ing an old one, in his arms, through the flames, and, immediately, knew them for young and old Mr. Stamford; but how was my horror increa&s;ed, when I heard a voice crying, aloud,</P>
<P><Q>OH, my mi&s;tre&s;s, my mi&s;tre&s;s, my poor young mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he will be burnt, &s;he mu&s;t be burnt, her cham|ber is on fire!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"WHOSE chamber," &s;aid I, <Q>Maria's chamber?</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>OH, yes, yes, my poor, dear, young lady</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="148">"WHERE is it? &s;hew me the way," &s;aid I, in the mo&s;t horrid agitation.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE &s;ervant flew to conduct me; and, regardle&s;s of the flames, which had &s;pread over the apartment, I bur&s;t open the door, darted through them, &s;natched up my dear Maria in my arms, and, without feeling any thing from the fire, bore her down &s;tairs, harmle&s;s, and out of danger.</P>
<P>OH God! how can I de&s;cribe what I felt?&mdash;I could hardly per&s;uade my|&s;elf, at fir&s;t, that &s;he was &s;afe.&mdash;I viewed the &s;preading blaze! I turned to Maria! I &s;ighed with exce&s;s of emotion! I held my Maria in my arms!&mdash;She had &s;woon|ed in the fright, and did not know me; no one was near us, the &s;ervant had ran for water.&mdash;In the tran&s;port of my joy

<P>THE &s;ervant returned, Maria began to revive, I was unwilling to be known and committed her to his care. I had pre&s;erved the jewel of my &s;oul, and perceived I could be of no farther &s;er|vice. I heard the younger Stamford uttering di&s;tracted cries for his &s;i&s;ter, and re&s;olved that he &s;hould not know his benefactor, if I could prevent it; I, therefore, made the be&s;t of my way into the high road again. His &s;i&s;ter was re&s;tored to his arms, and he was

<P>I FELL into &s;o profound a reverie in ruminating upon this accident, that, when I came into the road, I never ob&s;erved which way I turned; and, in|&s;tead of proceeding on my journey,

travelled back again. I did not di&s;cover my mi&s;take till day-light appeared, and I had got near twelve miles; when find|ing the &s;ervants up at a waggoner's inn, and my&s;elf exceedingly weary, I went to bed, and re&s;ted my&s;elf till eleven the next day. The news of the fire was, pre&s;ently, &s;pread all over the coun|try, and, almo&s;t, every one told a dif|ferent tale.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. Mr. SELDON, to Mr. STAMFORD, Sen.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR account of the dreadful fire at Maitland-hall, affected me ex|ceedingly. I rejoice, however, to ob&s;erve, that you all e&s;caped &s;afe, as the other misfortune admits of a remedy, in afford|ing which I &s;hall be happy to a&s;&s;i&s;t. Plea&s;e to let Mr. Maitland know how &s;incerely I condole with him on this un|happy bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I only wait his directions to do all in my power for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I AM in your debt for a former letter, in which you deplore the ba&s;ene&s;s and in|gratitude of young Alwyn. It is a
<PB N="143" REF="155" MS="y">
piece of news that I a&s;&s;ure you I heard with &s;ome regret, for I always entertained the highe&s;t opinion of the young man's principles. But you and I have lived long enough in the world to be &s;urprized at nothing. It might have been better, but u&s;ele&s;s grief can only make it wor&s;e, therefore, let him go unlamented. If con&s;cience has no power to torment him, yet, we may take it for granted that, in the end, his ingratitude will meet its reward.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay he is become a player. A profe&s;&s;ion that, in my opinion, contains the extremes of good and bad. The &s;ublime and forcible le&s;&s;ons of morality with which our dramatic pieces abound, &s;carcely permit the inculcator to &s;tand neuter. He mu&s;t either a&s;&s;ent to them, with that warmth which characterizes the good and great man, or, by a mo&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="156">
de&s;picable exce&s;s of hypocri&s;y, counter|feit, and <HI>&s;eem</HI> to feel, that virtue to which his mind is a &s;tranger. According to this latter mode, Alwyn, I believe, will make a good player; and, I think, it is fortunate that this &s;ituation in life will not allow him to exerci&s;e his talents for deception in a &s;phere of greater con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>NOW I talk of players, you are to know that I have received a very good account of my youth in the country; which helps to convince me that my plan is good, though it has had the mi&s;|fortune not to meet with your appro|bation. Weak plants, you &s;ay, mu&s;t be brought forward with care. The keen bla&s;t of adver&s;ity blights them, and they never come to maturity. My phi|lo&s;ophy &s;ays otherwi&s;e; it is that very care that makes them weak, both in mind

and con&s;titution. My boy will arrive at affluence, with a mind that has with|&s;tood the &s;hocks of misfortune; and will enjoy his independence with the more plea&s;ure, as he is better acquainted with its value. I am impatient to &s;ee him, and to make Julia happy. Her ready acquie&s;cence, in every thing I propo&s;ed for her advantage, de&s;erves whatever re|compen&s;e I can be&s;tow, and her merit will &s;ecure the happine&s;s of my &s;on.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Maria is much better, but Tom Maitland has been very ill, ever &s;ince the fire: it is not thought he will live. This dreadful accident, oc|ca&s;ioned by his giddine&s;s, is a great op|pre&s;&s;ion to his &s;pirits, and he di&s;covers much contrition for his pa&s;t follies. As he believes his end to be approaching, he laments, in the mo&s;t pathetic man|ner, the wa&s;te he has made of the be&s;t part of his time. I &s;incerely wi&s;h he may recover, and make my girl happy. This &s;troke has opened his eyes. The calmne&s;s with which he expects the clo&s;e of life, the &s;trong flow of good &s;en&s;e that appears in his conver&s;ation, and
<PB N="161" REF="173">
the &s;en&s;ibility he expre&s;&s;es for his afflict|ed father, convince me that I was mi&s;|taken in attributing his faults to a de|pravity of mind, in&s;tead of a levity of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>MR. MAITLAND, who was perfectly &s;uperior to the lo&s;s of his fortune, is un|able to with&s;tand this &s;econd calamity. Ye&s;terday morning we were &s;itting to|gether by Tom's bed-&s;ide: his languid eyes were fixed on his father, who&s;e coun|tenance expre&s;&s;ed the &s;truggle between his grief and the firmne&s;s of his mind. His &s;on gra&s;ped his hand, and looked at him with a tenderne&s;s that &s;eemed to intreat him not to grieve, but which, naturally produced the contrary effect. <Q>I under&s;tand you, Tom, &s;aid he, I will compo&s;e my&s;elf&mdash;I will endea|vour to bear my afflictions, and &s;ub|mit to the decrees of heaven with
<PB N="162" REF="174">
fortitude&mdash;but I mu&s;t feel that I am a father.</Q> So &s;aying he ro&s;e, and went out, being no longer able to con|ceal his emotions. The dying youth followed him with his eyes, and then turning to me, with a deep &s;igh, <Q>Oh Mr. Stamford,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>'tis I that have done this&mdash;I have oppre&s;&s;ed my father's age with want and &s;orrow&mdash; Oh that my death would re&s;tore his peace! with what plea&s;ure &s;hould I welcome the gloomy power! Your friend&s;hip may do much &mdash; go, dear Sir, follow him, and prevent his wa&s;ting the hours in u&s;ele&s;s grief. 'Tis a &s;atisfaction to me when I think, your friend&s;hip will a&s;&s;i&s;t him to bear his afflictions.</Q></P>
<P>I LEFT him, and went in &s;earch of Mr. Maitland, whom I found, &s;itting, with his head reclined, in a mu&s;ing po&s;|ture.
<PB N="163" REF="175">
His mind was &s;o intent on his misfortunes that he did not, at fir&s;t, per|ceive my approach.</P>

But, ah my child</Q> &s;aid he, his voice &s;often|ing as he &s;poke, <Q>'Tis not with tran|quillity, I can bear thy lo&s;s. O my friend, my Stamford, how vain is the reliance we place on the fortitude of our minds! Can it be philo&s;ophy to bear the torture of the &s;oul with in|difference? Are the tender affections faults which a wi&s;e man ought to en|deavour to overcome? Are they not, rather, the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of humanity, which to era&s;e is to be|come wor&s;e than inanimate? I am convinced they are. The arguments of the under&s;tanding are too weak to check the flow of the heart. I feel their in&s;ufficiency. O, my boy, how
<PB N="165" REF="177">
are my hopes bla&s;ted! I mu&s;t grieve. Never, again, &s;hall I delight in the &s;portive vivacity of my dear child.

The object of my cares, of my affections, is &s;natched from me, and I want fortitude to &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s. The &s;cheme of providence, which I vainly thought to have compre|hended, is fled, and darkne&s;s hangs over the pro&s;pect. Why are we taught to re|gard delicacy of &s;entiment and &s;en|&s;ibility

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. Mr. WESTWOOD to H. HANDFORD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL attempt no apology for the &s;ilence you charge me with&mdash;It is &s;ufficient excu&s;e, to you, to &s;ay, I was lazy, or &s;tupid, or both, which, you know, are no uncommon accidents in life.</P>
<P>YOUR player, that I intere&s;ted you &s;o much about, is gone.&mdash;Don't be alarm|ed&mdash;He has been guilty of no meanne&s;s, committed no outrage&mdash;His character is &s;acred to virtue&mdash;His exit has been with greater eclat than his entrance&mdash; But I have lo&s;t him&mdash;I never conceived a greater partiality for any man, I will
<PB N="169" REF="181">
not even except your&s;elf.&mdash;What a world would this be were men all like him and you!&mdash;Don't be angry&mdash;You mu&s;t mu&s;t permit me to &s;peak the truth.</P>
<P>I TOLD you the women were all in love with him; I'll now tell you the con&s;equence; the men were all jealous of him.&mdash;One of them, a mean ra&s;cal, who yet bears the title of gentleman, attempted, I believe, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. &mdash;Be that as it will, he hired two ruf|fians to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in taking that re|venge, which he had not the courage to attempt by him&s;elf.&mdash;With this inno|cent view did the&s;e three worthies way|lay him; and God knows what would have been the con&s;equence, had they had any common man to deal with; for the a&s;&s;i&s;tants were fellows remark|able for their prowe&s;s.&mdash;But our hero fairly vanqui&s;hed them all.&mdash;I happened
<PB N="170" REF="182">
to come up ju&s;t as he was fini&s;hing his conque&s;t.&mdash;I beheld him deal &s;ome half dozen blows.&mdash;Never, before, did I &s;ee &s;uch firmne&s;s and agility, nor &s;o much lenity, after the victory, to &s;uch vile ra&s;cals.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT was this affair that occa&s;ioned his departure, I &s;uppo&s;e.&mdash;He &s;upped with us on Sunday evening, when, in &s;pite of his endeavours to the contrary, he appeared exceedingly dejected.&mdash;He told us, it was probable, he &s;hould never have that plea&s;ure again; and was &s;o much affected, while he &s;aid this, that the tears gu&s;hed into his eyes, and he was obliged to turn his head away.&mdash; I perceived the &s;hame and confu&s;ion that the&s;e emotions excited in him, and delicacy obliged me to de&s;i&s;t from en|quiring into the cau&s;e of his grief.&mdash; He &s;eemed rather to wave any hints
<PB N="171" REF="183">
that were thrown out to him, to tell where he was going, and I was loath to urge him.&mdash;My mother, who almo&s;t doated on his company, could hardly be re&s;trained from a&s;king him que&s;tions, which, I perceived, would have em|barra&s;&s;ed him.&mdash;But he promi&s;ed, at parting, that if ever he were happy once more, which he believed impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould take great plea&s;ure in commu|nicating it to us.</P>
<P>SINCE he has been gone, we have heard &s;everal particulars, which only &s;erve to increa&s;e our admiration.&mdash;Two or three poor families have declared that he has given them a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and among the re&s;t, the wife of one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins confe&s;&s;ed he gave her a guinea, upon hearing &s;he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for her rent.&mdash;The ra&s;cal, her hu&s;band, has fled the country.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="184">I HAVE never found you offended, when I have happened to differ in opi|nion with you; I &s;hall, therefore, ven|ture to di&s;&s;ent from your picture of that &s;eminary where I had the good fortune fir&s;t to become acquainted with you.&mdash;That the outline is ju&s;t, I will readily grant, but the &s;hadings are too deep. This is only momentary with you, and while you recollect particular in&s;tances.&mdash;Neither have we any cau&s;e to wonder that learned men are not al|ways rational men.&mdash;There is a degree of genius requi&s;ite to this, which falls to the &s;hare of a few only.&mdash;The me|mory may be capable of bearing a great|er burthen than the imagination, and this produces plodders.&mdash;The rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition is equally true, and from hence &s;prings enthu&s;ia&s;m.&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;I lift the ferula, when I ought to ki&s;s the rod.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ume the tone of a

<P>THE impracticability of your ho&s;pi|tal, at lea&s;t, the impo&s;itions you are liable to &s;u&s;tain, are &s;o evident, that I &s;hall not attempt to rea&s;on with you concerning, it.

The motive does honour to your heart; and, if I did not &s;ee the inconveniencies attend|ing your &s;cheme, &s;hould wi&s;h to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the pur&s;uit.</P>

By that time your <HI>m&eacute;nager&icirc;e</HI> will either be demoli&s;hed, or con&s;iderably augmented.

I &s;uppo&s;e you have, &s;everal times, had your pockets filled with mice, who had fled thither to e&s;cape the army of cats you have purcha&s;ed.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend GEORGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE rare news for you&mdash;I am impatient till I have related it, but am re&s;olved to begin my &s;tory, and tell it methodically.</P>
<P>YOU are not unacquainted with my pa&s;&s;ion for traver&s;ing the fields, and lying about, in &s;ummer-time, upon green banks, under trees, or by the &s;ide of rivers.&mdash;The&s;e are my poetical moods, and I delight in indulging them. About a fortnight ago, in the mid&s;t of one of them, I was di&s;turbed by the ru&s;tling of the leaves, and the &s;udden appearance of a youth, that leaped, with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and agility, over a devili&s;h
<PB N="185" REF="197">
high hedge, and whi&s;ked by me, without noticing me, with the fleetne&s;s of a &s;tag that has ju&s;t broke cover.&mdash;I was amazed at the &s;ymmetry of the fellow's per&s;on, as well as his &s;wiftne&s;s; and, my imagina|tion having been warmed by Mon&s;ieur Homer's de&s;cription of the race, in which Clytonius was victor, my fancy ran as fa&s;t as his legs.&mdash;The &s;pirit of curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed, and I made twenty fruitle&s;s enquiries concerning this appa|rition.</P>
<P>A DAY or two after it appeared again, but in a quite different manner.&mdash;The mercurial &s;pirit was evaporated, in&s;tead of l'Allegro, he was quite il Pen&s;ero&s;o.&mdash; His arms were folded, his eyes fixed, and his cheeks bedewed with tears.&mdash;I would give you a de&s;cription of his per&s;on, but that it is needle&s;s.&mdash;I only &s;ay, I never &s;aw one that plea&s;ed me &s;o much before.
<PB N="186" REF="198">
I can't tell what ailed me, but his &s;low and &s;teady walk, his &s;ighs, which were deep and frequent; the melancholy to apparent in his vi&s;age, and the large tears that dropped, unob&s;erved as it were, down his face, gave me &s;en&s;ations of the mo&s;t forcible kind.&mdash;I wanted to di&s;|cour&s;e with him, in hopes I might have it in my power to alleviate his grief; and, for that purpo&s;e, walked by the &s;ide of him for the whole length of a meadow, without his taking the lea&s;t notice of me.&mdash;Ju&s;t before he came to the gate, he &s;topped, &s;uddenly, for a moment, lifted up his eyes to heaven, uttered a di&s;mal groan, and, after calling out aloud, Oh love! love! &s;tarted from where he &s;tood, gave a bound over the gate, and vani&s;h|ed again like lightning.</P>
<P>I WISH I could tell you, George, how I behaved.&mdash;For &s;ome time I remained
<PB N="187" REF="190">
&s;tupified, entranced, rivetted to the &s;pot. &mdash;As &s;oon as I could get loo&s;e, I whi&s;tled, I danced, I cur&s;ed, I prayed, and, at la&s;t, fairly cried for vexation.&mdash; I never &s;aw &s;o fine a fellow.&mdash;His grief, too, was &s;o noble, &s;o manly&mdash;It was fixed, rooted&mdash;</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, in this condition was I obliged to return home, chagrined enough, you may be &s;ure, and heard nothing of him for &s;everal days.&mdash;About a week afterwards, as I was going my rounds, I approached a place where a parcel of young villains were bathing. &mdash;Before I was got up to them, the whole pack &s;et up a yelping to tell me, one of the puppies, their playfellows, was drowning. I hobbled up to the ra&s;cals, as fa&s;t as I could, and, though I can &s;wim no more than the leaden goo&s;e in my Lord Vi&s;to's garden, &s;ou&s;ed in without

dread of danger, or &s;aying one &s;hort prayer.&mdash;The lying dogs, to be &s;ure, had told me that they did not believe it was out of my depth.&mdash;I &s;oon found to the contrary, though, and di&s;covered, more|over, like Fal&s;taff, that I had an admirable alacrity at &s;inking.&mdash;Yes, yes, Sir&mdash;I was at the bottom in a twinkling, and there I might have lain, in &s;ure and cer|tain hope of being dragged out by a boat hook, when I had taken in &s;ufficient water for the voyage, had not this&mdash;aye, this Alwyn&mdash;the individual, identical, player&mdash;your Alwyn, my Alwyn&mdash; The melancholy youth, the runner&mdash; but you &s;hall hear more anon.&mdash;He leapt in&mdash;Sir, he &s;tood as little upon ceremony as I had done.&mdash;But then he is a different fellow&mdash;a very different fellow.&mdash;A man and a boy drowned, &s;aid he, God forbid!&mdash; Sir, he brought us

<P>HOW the devil &s;hall I contrive to tell you the re&s;t of this &s;tory, to make you caper, and &s;ing, and wipe your eyes, and rub your &s;hins as a Chri&s;tian ought

<P>DEAR George, forgive my weakne&s;s &mdash;I can &s;carcely proceed&mdash;I can trifle no longer.&mdash;Is it any wonder that I am

<P>WE arrived here &s;afe, and hope for the plea&s;ure of your com|pany, as &s;oon as your &s;on is in a condi|tion to bear the journey. Our mutual friend, Seldon, de&s;ires his re&s;pects, and expre&s;&s;es a great inclination to &s;erve you; but I told him, I had a prior claim. 'Tis the highe&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction to me, that I have it in my power: not for the &s;elfi&s;h view of counterbalancing the obligation I owe you, but, &s;incerely, out of regard for tho&s;e virtues that fir&s;t attached me to you. I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Maitland, I &s;hall think it pride, and not philo&s;o|phy, if you continue to refu&s;e my offers.
<PB N="198" REF="210">
'Tis true, a philo&s;opher can &s;ub&s;i&s;t on a little. Exclude artificial wants, and a &s;mall income will be &s;ufficient. But there are two prerogatives the rich en|joy, which I am confident you would mi&s;s exceedingly. The power of do|ing good, and the company of people of enlarged under&s;tandings. The fir&s;t you will readily allow to be concomi|tant with riches; and, though genius and intelligence are not confined to &s;tation, it is no wonder that we find they flouri&s;h, mo&s;t, in the &s;oil be&s;t adapted to their improvement. Want of lei&s;ure, and want of in&s;truction, prevent many a bright mind from unfolding its powers.</P>
<P>BUT, arguments apart, I beg you will recollect, with how little ceremony I reque&s;ted your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, on a former occa&s;ion, when my future welfare en|tirely depended on it. I did your
<PB N="199" REF="211">
friend&s;hip ju&s;tice. I believed you &s;in|cere. I even expected you would re|joice in the opportunity of &s;erving me. Nor was I deceived. I did you a fa|vour in permitting you to exert your&s;elf for my advantage; and I intreat, nay, I in&s;i&s;t, that you will let me enjoy the &s;ame &s;atisfaction in my turn. I &s;hall think you doubt my friend&s;hip, if you refu&s;e me the privilege of rebuilding Maitland-hall; and of adding my little e&s;tate to your farm in E&s;&s;ex, to which it is contiguous. I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to urge, as an argument, that I can &s;pare it, becau&s;e that would be the lea&s;t con&s;ideration in the affair: but, how|ever, it is &s;o, and, if that will be any inducement to your acceptance, I beg you will not demur on that account.</P>
<P>WHILE I am writing, a letter is ar|rived from a Mr. Hilkirk, who is the
<PB N="200" REF="212">
&s;on of our friend Seldon. He has adopted a &s;trange mode of education for him, which, in my opinion, is ra|ther dangerous. To enhance the va|lue and enjoyment of pro&s;perity, and to give, at the &s;ame time, fortitude of mind, and a knowledge of the world, he turned him adrift, &s;ome years ago, and the event has an&s;wered his expecta|tions; thanks to the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the youth, more than to the pru|dence of the &s;cheme it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT more of this when we meet. At pre&s;ent I am to acquaint you, the purport of his letter is, that, in con&s;equence of an adverti&s;ement, in|&s;erted in the papers, he has appre|hended your late &s;ervant, Stokes, at Taunton-Dean, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, who offered an inland bill of exchange, to di&s;count, to a friend of his. He has

<P>I AM in hopes that we &s;hall obtain intelligence, which will tend to recover your lo&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure; and &s;hall write again on the &s;ubject, if your ar|rival in town &s;hould not render it un|nece&s;&s;ary. I am, dear Sir,</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the effect your la&s;t letter had in our family. I never beheld my mother &s;o affected before. You cannot imagine how much Mr. Alwyn is beloved by us all.

<P>BY Stokes's direction, a party of Sir John Fielding's men were di&s;patched to a hou&s;e in Duke's-Place, where, after a &s;trict &s;earch, your box was found. It appears, by his confe&s;&s;ion, that he was connected with a gang of tho&s;e villains who u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to gain
<PB N="222" REF="234">
intelligence, by the means of &s;ervants, of the property in any hou&s;e they are de|&s;irous of pillaging. He was but too capable of affording them that informa|tion, and, as the number of your peo|ple prevented their attempting to break into Maitland-hall, they contrived to &s;et it on fire. We all know the &s;ucce&s;s of their attempt, and, it is to be hoped, the reward will follow; &s;uch methods being, now, &s;et on foot, as promi&s;e to bring the offenders within the reach of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE whole &s;tory being long, I &s;hall defer it till your arrival, and, in the interim, have another piece of bu&s;ine&s;s to communicate, which gives me &s;ome pain, though, I am a&s;&s;ured, you know me too well to &s;uppo&s;e me actuated by any motives but tho&s;e of the &s;tricte&s;t inte|grity and regard for you.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="235">I DARE &s;ay you are &s;urprized at this preamble, and, I am convinced, it is un|nece&s;&s;ary; therefore, without more words, you are to know, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for our children to be united, as we, once, flattered our&s;elves. I have di&s;covered that my Maria's affections were fixed be|fore &s;he &s;aw your &s;on, and am &s;incerely concerned that I was not &s;ooner apprized of it. There is rea&s;on to think your &s;on is not violently bent on the match; at lea&s;t I hope &s;o. I make no apologies for my frankne&s;s and &s;incerity. Your candour will not require them, when you are acquainted with the affair. On the contrary, I rely on having the plea&s;ure of your company, and that of your &s;on, at my daughter's marriage.</P>
<P>IT is now four years &s;ince I received into my counting-hou&s;e a young gentle|man, of the name of Alwyn, the &s;on of
<PB N="224" REF="236">
that Alwyn whom you have &s;o often heard me mention with affection and re|gret. You may, perhaps, remember &s;eeing him when you were in town, about two years ago. The trifling property his father left, was barely &s;ufficient to maintain his mother in a country retreat; &s;o that I had the plea&s;ure of doing him a &s;ingular &s;ervice, by introducing him to the world. My care was not lo&s;t on an ungrateful charge. I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him daily improve in every ac|compli&s;hment, and to behold the virtues of my friend revive in the per&s;on of his &s;on. A native &s;incerity and openne&s;s of conduct, added to the mo&s;t mild and obliging di&s;po&s;ition, commanded the e&s;teem of all, who knew him; and, for my part, I regarded him, almo&s;t, as my own child. At the beginning of this &s;ummer he went into the country, for the benefit of his health, as he then
<PB N="225" REF="237">
informed me; but, as I now find, to avoid the pre&s;ence of my daughter, for whom he entertained a pa&s;&s;ion, that did not, as he rightly judged, &s;uit his circum|&s;tances. Maria was, at the &s;ame time, equal|ly prejudiced in his favour, which makes his retreat more generous and di&s;intere&s;t|ed. While he was in the country, I received a letter, charging him with a degree of perfidy and ba&s;ene&s;s, that I &s;hould never have credited, had not the proof appeared of the mo&s;t incontro|vertible, nature. I wrote to him, on the &s;ubject, as, I thought, the crime de&s;erv|ed; and his innocence would, proba|bly, never have been vindicated, but for a fortunate concurrence of circum|&s;tances, that have cleared up the whole my&s;tery.</P>
<P>THE relation is too long to be in|&s;erted in this letter, and mu&s;t be de|ferred
<PB N="226" REF="238">
till your arrival. He has been vilely traduced. He is incapable of the lea&s;t meane&s;s. Come to us, my dear Maitland, I know you will love him. 'Twas he that &s;aved my daughter from the flames, and delivered me from a life of &s;orrow. She is due to his care. He has merited her. I know my dear friend will think &s;o, and rejoice with us. I am quite elated. We are all happy. My Maria is hardly recovered, from the &s;urprize and joy this event has occa&s;ioned. Charles is in raptures to find his Alwyn the amiable charac|ter he once thought him; and Alwyn is in a &s;tate that can better be ima|gined than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE company of your&s;elf and &s;on will be an addition to our happine&s;s, with which we hope you will &s;oon
<PB N="227" REF="239">
favour us. For that rea&s;on I conclude, without ceremony, by a&s;&s;uring you that I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. Mr. ALWYN, to Mr. WESTWOOD.</HEAD>
<P>FORGIVE, dear Sir, my having, till now, delayed to write you an account of the completion of my feli|city. I have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent happy turn of my fate as a thing utterly impo&s;&s;ible, that I &s;carce can, yet, believe it real. Thanks to my worthy patron, my kind father; thanks to my honoured uncle, and my dear, dear Maria, I am, at length, convinced. La&s;t Friday was the di&s;tingui&s;hed day that gave the mo&s;t amiable, the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex to my arms. I cannot de&s;cribe the joy which reigns univer&s;ally among us. I am en|circled by friends, by relations, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, by angels.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="241">FORTUNE &s;eems re&s;olved no longer to let virtue and genius langui&s;h in ob|&s;curity. This appears by an event which has increa&s;ed our happine&s;s. My friend, and former companion, Mr. Hil|kirk, came to town on Thur&s;day. You may remember, when I was at Kendal, I gave you the hi&s;tory of his adven|tures, and how much you found your|&s;elf intere&s;ted. You thought the con|duct of Mr. Seldon quite aenigmatical: but what will you &s;ay when you are informed that he is the only &s;on of that gentleman; that he is beloved with a mo&s;t parental tenderne&s;s; and that his father has contrived, not only to give him a very peculiar kind of education, but that he has, al&s;o, brought up Julia with an expre&s;s intention of her becom|ing his wife: that their love for each other was, in &s;ome degree, the effect of &s;tratagem, on the part of Mr. Seldon,
<PB N="230" REF="242">
who had nothing &s;o much at heart as the making them both happy; and that he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted misfortune, as it were, in the per&s;ecution of his &s;on, &s;till taking care to keep, by various contrivances, an eye over his actions, and not per|mitting him to be entirely depre&s;&s;ed? Mr. Seldon had &s;uffered almo&s;t every kind of hard&s;hip in his youth; but, by the force of good &s;en&s;e and indu&s;try, had, with amazing fortitude, &s;urmount|ed every difficulty, and is, at pre&s;ent, not only a very worthy, but a very con|&s;equential member of &s;ociety. His &s;on, who&s;e name is William Hilkirk Seldon, was born before the old gentleman had emerged from ob&s;curity; and, his mo|ther dying, was placed at a pea&s;ant's in the country, and, afterwards, &s;ent to a grammar-&s;chool. But, as the father had already re&s;olved upon a plan of educa|tion, he did not let even the people
<PB N="231" REF="243">
with whom his &s;on was know to whom he belonged.</P>
<P>YOU have heard the re&s;idue of the &s;tory, except that Mr. Hilkirk has been the principal agent in di&s;covering the villain who fired Maitland-hall, and purloined the &s;trong box. Mr. Seldon applauds him&s;elf, exceedingly, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan. He beholds him with the combined advantages that edu|cation and an active life be&s;tow. He affirms that, if, by any mi&s;chance, his &s;on &s;hould become poor, he will &s;upport the change with fortitude: that the com|mon accidents of life will not have power to deprive him of temper: that his know|ledge of mankind will, not only make him di&s;cern the motives of their actions, but, likewi&s;e, give him an a&s;cendancy over them.&mdash;Indeed, he adduces a thou|&s;and rea&s;ons, which, at lea&s;t, are exceed|ingly
<PB N="232" REF="244">
&s;pecious, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, true; but, I dare &s;ay, you think with me, that, had the experiment been made up|on a weaker mind, it would &s;carcely have &s;ucceeded &s;o well.</P>
<P>WHEN my friend Hilkirk, for &s;o I mu&s;t &s;till call him, arrived in town, his beloved Julia was with us, at Mr. Stam|ford's, whither he immediately flew. The interview was tender and affecting. The young lady, who had put the ut|mo&s;t re&s;traint upon her inclinations, in obedience to Mr. Seldon, who is her uncle, was incapable of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing her emotions. She was fearful, le&s;t her for|mer treatment of Hilkirk, whom &s;he tenderly loved, and which was the ef|fect of her uncle's commands, &s;hould be remembered by him, and could not conceal her anxiety. Hilkirk felt the delicacy of her pa&s;&s;ion, without the
<PB N="233" REF="245">
power of alleviating her fears, except by repeated declarations of his love.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day that Mr. Hilkirk ar|rived, Mr. Maitland, the young gentle|man who was de&s;igned for Maria, and his father, came to town. Mr. Mait|land &s;enior, who is a mo&s;t amiable man, in&s;tead of being chagrined at his &s;on's di&s;appointment, expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of our felicity; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, was remarkably liberal of good-natured reflections, in favour of your humble &s;ervant. The vivacity of the young gentleman, too, has been of &s;ingular &s;ervice, in giving the conver&s;ation, which has been apt to take too &s;enti|mental a turn, a degree of ea&s;e and brilliancy that have had a very plea&s;ing effect, and which has been much height|ened by the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of the father, as well as the friend&s;hip and
<PB N="234" REF="246">
attachment he di&s;covers for the Stam|ford family, of which I am, now, become a part. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted, at the marriage ce|remony, with a degree of chearfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure that proved the &s;atisfaction he received. Never, before, did I be|hold &s;o happy a day. My dear Maria, with a profu&s;ion of charms, a multitude of virtues, made inevitably mine; my friend receiving the reward of his con|&s;tancy, the hand of his Julia, at the &s;ame time: &s;urrounded by my mother, who&s;e heart was replete with tenderne&s;s and joy; by my uncle, who&s;e eyes and ac|tions proved how much he was inter|e&s;ted; care&s;&s;ed by my dear friend, the brother of my Maria, and rewarded by her father; it was an exce&s;s of tran&s;port that can only be imagined.</P>
<P>I MUST forbear. The ideas are too luxuriant, too inexpre&s;&s;ible. Pray give
<PB N="235" REF="247">
my mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;pects to your wor|thy parents, and tell them, when they come to town during the approaching winter, they will find a &s;mall &s;ociety, who hope frequently to enjoy the plea|&s;ure of their company; of which honour no one is more de&s;irous than,</P>
