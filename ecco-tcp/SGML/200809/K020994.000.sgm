<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems to be a kind of duty incumbent on tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to Poetry, to rai&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Compo&s;ition, and the charac|ter of modern Times will allow: The ages, in|deed, are pa&s;t, in which the &s;ong of the Poet was idolized for its <HI>miraculous effects</HI>; yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may &s;till, perhaps, be fortunate enough to prove of &s;ome little &s;ervice to &s;ocie|ty in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by &s;ober Rea&s;on, it is at lea&s;t one of tho&s;e plea&s;ing and innocent delu&s;ions, in which a poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;t may be &s;afely indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">The following production owes its exi&s;tence to an incident in real life, very &s;imilar to the principal action of the la&s;t Canto; but in form|ing the general plan of the work, it &s;eemed to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwith&s;tand|ing the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a &s;ubject &s;o happily executed by the ma&s;terly pencil of Pope. I con&s;idered his Cave of Spleen as a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite cabinet picture; and, to avoid the &s;ervility of imitation, I determined to &s;ketch the man&s;ion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canva&s;s: Happy, indeed, if the judgment of the Public may enable me to ex|claim, with the hone&s;t vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine pro|ductions of Raphael,
<Q>E &s;on Pittore anch' Io!</Q></P>
<P>The celebrated Ale&s;&s;andro Ta&s;&s;oni, who is generally con&s;idered as the inventor of the mo|dern
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
Heroi-comic Poety, was &s;o proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of compo&s;ition, that he not only &s;poke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an in&s;cription, in which he &s;tyled it a new &s;pecies of Poetry, in|vented by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A few partial friends have a&s;&s;erted, that the pre&s;ent performance has &s;ome degree of &s;imilar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, may rather require an apology, than en|title its Author to challenge commendation, I &s;hall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the mo&s;t approved models in this mode of writing, and &s;lightly mention the poe|tical effects, which &s;uch a variation appeared likely to produce.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the &s;erious and the comic, repre|&s;ent
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
their principal characters in a &s;atirical point of view: It was the intention of Ta&s;&s;oni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to &s;atirize a particular Italian Nobleman, who happened to be the object of his re&s;ent|ment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics in his Lutrin; Garth, our Engli&s;h Phy&s;icians, in his Di&s;pen&s;ary; and the Rape of the Lock it&s;elf, that mo&s;t excellent and enchant|ing Poem, which I never contemplate but with new idolatry, is denominated <HI>the be&s;t Satire extant,</HI> by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very elegant and ingenious, but &s;evere E&s;&s;ay on Pope: A &s;entence which &s;eems to be confirmed by the Poet him&s;elf, in his letter to Mrs. Fer|mor, where he &s;ays, <Q>The character of Belinda, as it is now managed, re&s;embles you in nothing but in beauty.</Q> Though I think, that no compo&s;ition can &s;urpa&s;s, or perhaps ever equal this mo&s;t happy effort of Genius, as a &s;portive
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
Satire, I imagined it might be po&s;&s;ible to give a new Character to this mixed &s;pecies of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the mo&s;t beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have &s;een it carried to inimitable perfection, in the mo&s;t de|licate raillery on Female Foibles:&mdash;It remained to be tried, if it might not al&s;o a&s;pire to deline|ate the more engaging features of Female Excel|lence. The idea appeared to me worth the ex|periment; for, if it &s;ucceeded, it &s;eemed to promi&s;e a double advantage; fir&s;t, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, &s;econdly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more intere&s;ting to the heart. On the&s;e principles, I have endeavoured to paint SERENA as a mo&s;t lovely, engaging, and ac|compli&s;hed character; yet I hope the colour|ing is &s;o faithfully copied from <HI>general Nature,</HI> that every man, who reads the Poem, may be
<PB N="x" REF="9">
happy enough to know many Fair ones, who re&s;emble my Heroine.</P>
<P>There is another point, in which I have al|&s;o attempted to give this Poem an air of no|velty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, which compo&s;e it; by &s;hifting the&s;e in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a &s;trong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an ap|pearance particularly diver&s;ified. I wi&s;hed, in|deed (but I fear mo&s;t ineffectually) for powers to unite &s;ome touches of the &s;portive wildne&s;s of Ario&s;to, and the more &s;erious &s;ublime painting of Dante, with &s;ome portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if po&s;&s;ible, with|out violating tho&s;e rules of propriety, which Mr. Cambridge has illu&s;trated, by example as well as precept, in The Scribleriad, and in
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
his &s;en&s;ible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem.</P>
<P>I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the <HI>extent,</HI> or rather of the <HI>extravagance</HI> of my de&s;ire; for I will not give it the &s;erious name of <HI>de&s;ign</HI>: They, whom an enlightened ta&s;te has rendered thoroughly &s;en&s;ible how very difficult it mu&s;t be to accompli&s;h &s;uch an idea, will not only be the fir&s;t to di&s;cern, but the mo&s;t ready to pardon tho&s;e errors, into which &s;o hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Di&s;&s;ertation of con&s;iderable length on this &s;pecies of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge my&s;elf any farther in &s;uch prelimi|nary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is &s;o apt to produce, from the reflection, that, how|ever ingeniou&s;ly written, they add little or no|thing to the &s;ucce&s;s of a good Poem, and are
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
utterly in&s;ufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</P>
<P>In di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their peru&s;al, I &s;hall only recommend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the plea&s;ant and courteous Ta&s;&s;oni&mdash;
<Q><L>Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice,</L>
<L>E chi la leggera, viva felice!</L></Q></P>

<L>THE Mind's &s;oft Guardian, who, tho' yet un&s;ung,</L>

<L>The &s;mile of angels to a mortal face;</L>
<L N="5">Her powers I &s;ing; and &s;cenes of mental &s;trife,</L>
<L>Which form the maiden for th' accompli&s;h'd wife;</L>
<L>Where the &s;weet victre&s;s &s;ees, with &s;parkling eyes,</L>
<L>Love her reward, and Happine&s;s her prize.</L>
<L>Daughters of Beauty, who the &s;ong in&s;pire,</L>
<L N="10">To your enchanting notes attune my lyre!</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="13">And O! if haply your &s;oft hearts may gain</L>
<L>Or u&s;e, or plea&s;ure from the motley &s;train,</L>
<L>Tho' formal critics, with a &s;urly frown,</L>
<L>Deny your artle&s;s Bard the laurel crown,</L>
<L N="15">He &s;till &s;hall triumph, if ye deign to &s;pread</L>
<L>Your &s;weeter myrtle round his honour'd head.</L>
<L>In your bright circle young SERENA grew;</L>
<L>A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew;</L>
<L>For the fond Graces form'd her ea&s;y mien,</L>
<L N="20">And Heaven's &s;oft azure in her eye was &s;een.</L>
<L>She &s;eem'd a ro&s;e-bud, when it fir&s;t receives</L>
<L>The genial &s;un in its expanding leaves:</L>
<L>For now &s;he enter'd tho&s;e important years,</L>
<L>When the full bo&s;om &s;wells with hopes and fears;</L>
<L N="25">When con&s;cious Nature prompts the &s;ecret &s;igh,</L>
<L>And &s;heds &s;weet languor o'er the melting eye;</L>
<L>When nobler toys the female heart trepan,</L>
<L>And Dolls rejected, yield their place to Man.</L>
<L>Beneath a Father's care SERENA grew;</L>
<L N="30">The good Sir Gilbert, to his country true,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="14">A faithful Whig, who, zealous for the &s;tate,</L>
<L>In Freedom's &s;ervice led the loud debate;</L>
<L>Yet every day, by tran&s;mutation rare,</L>
<L>Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow chair,</L>
<L N="35">And made his daughter pay, howe'er ab&s;urd,</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ive obedience to his &s;overeign word.</L>
<L>In his dome&s;tic &s;way he borrow'd aid</L>
<L>From prim PENELOPE, an ancient maid,</L>
<L>His upright &s;i&s;ter, con&s;cious of her worth,</L>
<L N="40">Who valued &s;till her beauty, and her birth;</L>
<L>Tho' from her birth no envied rank &s;he gain'd,</L>
<L>And of her beauty but the gho&s;t remain'd;</L>
<L>A re&s;tle&s;s gho&s;t! that with remembrance keen</L>
<L>Proclaim'd ince&s;&s;ant what it once had been;</L>
<L N="45">Delighted &s;till the &s;teps of youth to haunt,</L>
<L>To watch the tender nymph, and warm gallant;</L>
<L>And, with an eye that petrified pur&s;uit,</L>
<L>Hang like the dragon o'er th' He&s;perian fruit.</L>
<L>Tho' &s;trictly guarded by this jealous power,</L>
<L N="50">The mild SERENA no re&s;traint could &s;our:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="15">Pure was her bo&s;om, as the &s;ilver lake,</L>
<L>Ere ri&s;ing winds the ruffled water &s;hake,</L>
<L>When the bright pageants of the morning &s;ky</L>
<L>Acro&s;s th' expan&s;ive mirror lightly fly,</L>
<L N="55">By vernal gales in gay &s;ucce&s;&s;ion driven,</L>
<L>While the clear gla&s;s reflects the &s;mile of heaven.</L>
<L>In gay content a &s;portive life &s;he led,</L>
<L>The child of Mode&s;ty, by Virtue bred:</L>
<L>Her light companions Innocence and Ea&s;e:</L>
<L N="60">Her hope was Plea&s;ure, and her wi&s;h to plea&s;e:</L>
<L>For this to Fa&s;hion early rites &s;he paid:</L>
<L>For this to Venus &s;ecret vows &s;he made;</L>
<L>Nor held it &s;in to ca&s;t a private glance</L>
<L>O'er the dear pages of a new romance,</L>
<L N="65">Eager in Fiction's touching &s;cenes to find</L>
<L>A field, to exerci&s;e her youthful mind:</L>
<L>The touching &s;cenes new energy impre&s;t</L>
<L>On all the virtues of her feeling brea&s;t.</L>
<L>Sweet Evelina's fa&s;cinating power</L>
<L N="70">Had fir&s;t beguil'd of &s;leep her midnight hour:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="16">Po&s;&s;e&s;t by Sympathy's enchanting &s;way,</L>
<L>She read, uncon&s;cious of the dawning day.</L>
<L>The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd</L>
<L>Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid.</L>
<L N="75">The nymph, attentive as the brooding dove,</L>
<L>Pored o'er the tender &s;cenes of Franzel's love:</L>
<L>The &s;inking taper now grew weak and pale;</L>
<L>SERENA &s;igh'd, and dropt th' unfini&s;h'd tale;</L>
<L>But, as warm clouds in vernal aether roll,</L>
<L N="80">The &s;oft ideas floated in her &s;oul:</L>
<L>Free from ambitious pride, and envious care,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd, was all her prayer:</L>
<L>While the&s;e fond thoughts her gentle mind po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Soft &s;lumber &s;ettled on her &s;nowy brea&s;t.</L>
<L N="85">Scarce had her radiant eyes began to clo&s;e,</L>
<L>When to her view a friendly vi&s;ion ro&s;e:</L>
<L>A fairy Phantom &s;truck her mental &s;ight,</L>
<L>Light as the go&s;&s;amer, as aether bright;</L>
<L>Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form,</L>
<L N="90">When the &s;age Godde&s;s &s;tills the martial &s;torm.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="17">Her ca&s;que was amber, richly grac'd above</L>
<L>With down, collected from the callow dove:</L>
<L>Her burni&s;h'd brea&s;t-plate, of a deeper dye,</L>
<L>Was once the armour of a golden fly:</L>
<L N="95">A lynx's eye her little aegis &s;hone,</L>
<L>By fairy &s;pells converted into &s;tone,</L>
<L>And worn of old, as elfin poets &s;ing,</L>
<L>By Aegypt's lovely queen, a favourite ring:</L>
<L>My&s;terious power was in the magic toy,</L>
<L N="100">To turn the frowns of care to &s;miles of joy.</L>
<L>Her tiny lance, who&s;e radiance &s;tream'd afar,</L>
<L>Was one bright &s;parkle from the bridal &s;tar.</L>
<L>A filmy mantle round her figure play'd,</L>
<L>Fine as the texture, by Arachne laid</L>
<L N="105">O'er &s;ome young plant, when glittering to the view</L>
<L>With many an orient pearl of morning dew.</L>
<L>The Phantom hover'd o'er the con&s;cious Fair</L>
<L>With &s;uch a lively &s;mile of tender care,</L>
<L>As on her elfin lord Titania ca&s;t,</L>
<L N="110">When fir&s;t &s;he found his angry &s;pell was pa&s;t.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="18">Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie</L>
<L>An ample ribband of caerulean dye:</L>
<L>High o'er her forehead ro&s;e the graceful bow,</L>
<L>Who&s;e arch commanded the &s;weet &s;cene below:</L>
<L N="115">The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting &s;pot,</L>
<L>And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot;</L>

<L>Now in &s;oft notes, more mu&s;ically clear</L>
<L>Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal ear,</L>
<L>The&s;e words the vi&s;ionary voice convey'd</L>
<L>To the charm'd &s;pirit of the &s;leeping maid:</L>
<L N="125">"Thou darling of my care! who&s;e ripen'd worth</L>

<L N="135">To bear what ills the little Female haunt,</L>
<L>The te&s;ty Nur&s;e, the imperious Governante,</L>
<L>And that tyrannic pe&s;t, the prying maiden Aunt.</L>
<L>Now ripening years a nobler &s;cene &s;upply;</L>
<L>For life now opens on thy &s;parkling eye:</L>
<L N="140">Thy ri&s;ing bo&s;om &s;wells with ju&s;t de&s;ire</L>
<L>Rapture to feel, and rapture to in&s;pire:</L>
