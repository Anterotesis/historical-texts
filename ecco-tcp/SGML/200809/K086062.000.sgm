To Fancy, that capricious Godde&s;s,</L>

<L>Who reads not Pope? Or has forgot,</L>
<L>She once &s;uppos'd her&s;elf a pot?</L>

<L>Another time, as authors tell ye,</L>

<L>No hungry Alderman might eat her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A third &s;trange whimwham, pray Sir note,</L>
<L>She once crept down a cobler's throat,</L>
<L>And there the cur&s;t, fanta&s;tic vixen</L>
<L>The &s;imple fellow play'd her tricks on;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21">
Swearing, in phra&s;es mo&s;t unhallow'd,</L>

<L>And beat his brow, and cur&s;e his fate,</L>
<L>And rub his eyes, and &s;cratch his pate,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22">
And beg and pray his Polyhymnia,</L>

<L>Good Sir, &s;aid Will, I ne'er &s;uppos'd</L>

<L>Far other men were in my gue&s;s,</L>

<L>Who u&s;eful arts the nations taught,</L>
<L>Or who for Freedom bravely fought;</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="65">
Who, fir&s;t, with plough&s;hare, broke the glebe,</L>

<L>He who conducted lovely Truth</L>
<L>And Science to the haunts of Youth,</L>
<L>Aptly their plea&s;ing lore convey'd,</L>
<L>And all their wond'rous gifts di&s;play'd.</L>
<L>Of &s;uch I &s;poke&mdash;or he who&s;e &s;ong</L>
<L>Charm'd and reform'd the li&s;tening throng.</L>
<L>Who, as the ringing harp he &s;wung,</L>
<L>Rais'd his &s;weet voice and rapid tongue</L>
<L>In phra&s;e mo&s;t fit, and lofty ver&s;e,</L>
<L>The deeds of heroes to rehear&s;e!</L>
<L>(Of heroes, who, by Virtue claim'd,</L>

<L>Who, as along the numbers roll'd,</L>
<L>The laws of Nature could unfold!</L>
<L>Or with a &s;ad and piteous tale</L>
<L>The man of iron could a&s;&s;ail;</L>
<L>Or, when Oppre&s;&s;ion dur&s;t provoke,</L>

<L>Their headlong rage would &s;trait controul,</L>

<L>How oft, friend Will, reply'd the Knight,</L>
<L>Am I oblig'd to &s;et you right;</L>
<L>Again repeating, and again,</L>
<L>Men ever were, and will be men?</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="66">
Why mu&s;t I tell you, no man, yet,</L>
<L>That Eve and Adam could beget,</L>

<L>So once a painter, in &s;uppo&s;es,</L>

And, when he'd done, &s;o &s;ays the &s;tory,</L>

<L>This brings an anecdote to mind,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="70">
Concerning an irreverend Friar,</L>
<L>Miracle-monger, therefore liar;</L>
<L>A relic juggler, mo&s;t rapacious;</L>
<L>Of life luxurious and &s;alacious,</L>
<L>Who watch'd a wooden virgin's &s;hrine,</L>
<L>And was, by fools, &s;uppos'd divine.</L>

<L>It chanc'd, one Summer, where he dwelt,</L>

<L>To heav'n &s;end many a vague petition;</L>

<L>Well, Sir,&mdash;the farce is underta'en,</L>
<L>When lo! it &s;trait begins to rain;</L>
<L>A Miracle! the people cry,</L>

<L>And how the Virgin did in&s;pire,</L>

</LG>

<L>You a&s;k how he could here deceive:</L>
