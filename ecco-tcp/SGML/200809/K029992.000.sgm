<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.</HEAD>
<P>AN Attachment to <HI>Letters,</HI> and a regard for the profe&s;&s;ion of an <HI>author,</HI> would, perhaps, never have permitted the writer of the following pages, to doubt the &s;uperiority of the <HI>literary arti&s;t,</HI> or the propriety of the encouragement given to <HI>his</HI> labours above tho&s;e of <HI>others</HI>; had not an equal encouragement been obtained of the Legi&s;lature, a few years ago, for <HI>Engravers, etchers</HI> and <HI>mezzo|tinto &s;crapers.</HI></P>
<P>This circum&s;tance leading to an enquiry into the re&s;pective merits of Arti&s;ts in general, the <HI>practi|tioners</HI> of the <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> were found to lay &s;o &s;imilar a claim to public encouragement with the <HI>profe&s;&s;ors</HI> of the <HI>polite</HI> arts, that the di&s;tinction, which the Law had made in the right of property to their different labours, could not fail to appear extremely partial and inequitable.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4">With a view to &s;tate this partiality to the pub|lick, the following tract, in which the <HI>&s;cientific</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Arts are compared with tho&s;e of <HI>Litera|ture</HI> and <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> in the re&s;pect abovementioned, would have earlier appeared, agreeably to the no|tice given in the Public Adverti&s;er of June 29, 1771, had not the argument been thought to be affected by the then uncertain &s;tate of <HI>Literary Property.</HI> This being &s;ince in &s;ome Mea&s;ure deter|mined, and the Doctrine in que&s;tion having received the &s;anction of very high authority, the pre&s;ent Publication is judged expedient to promote the De|&s;ign of obtaining farther encouragement for the ex|ertions of <HI>u&s;eful Ingenuity,</HI> and thence facilitating future Improvements in the <HI>Produce, Manufactures,</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> of the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Arti&s;ts</HI> in general will probably think it prudent to &s;olicit an innovation, at pre&s;ent &s;o repugnant to public prejudice, as that of being put <HI>preci&s;ely on the &s;ame footing</HI> with <HI>Authors</HI> and <HI>Engravers.</HI> By di&s;playing, however, the equity of their preten&s;ions to equal con&s;ideration and en|couragement, it is pre&s;umed that the le&s;s objection
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
may be made to their application for a parliame|tary exten&s;ion of the u&s;ual term of exerci&s;ing their inventions by patent, with a repeal of the clau&s;e in the monopoly act, which now re&s;trains the crown in all ca&s;es indi&s;criminately, from granting &s;uch patents for more than fourteen years; a term in many particular ca&s;es greatly inadequate to the labour, pains and expence, attendant on bringing u&s;eful inventions and di&s;coveries to perfection.&mdash; The Moderation of &s;uch a reque&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly in|duce &s;ome public-&s;pirited patron of the <HI>u&s;eful arts,</HI> to urge more powerfully the expediency of granting to their profe&s;&s;ors privileges proportionate to their per&s;onal merit and public Utility.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE ARTISTS AND MANUFACTURERS OF GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A Writer, who has devoted his time as much to the <HI>u&s;eful</HI> as the <HI>polite</HI> Arts, may take on him, without impropriety, to treat of that very partial di&s;tinction, which the laws of his country have made between his right of property to the emo|luments ari&s;ing from his different pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>As an <HI>Author</HI> and an <HI>Arti&s;t</HI> of a <HI>certain cla&s;s,</HI> an exclu&s;ive right, to profit by his compo&s;itions and inventions, is &s;ecured to him by Statute for a con&s;iderable term of years; as an <HI>Ar|tificer</HI> or <HI>arti&s;t</HI> of any <HI>other cla&s;s,</HI> he is de&s;titute of &s;uch &s;ecurity. Let his <HI>inventions</HI> or <HI>di&s;coveries</HI> co&s;t him what time, or expence they may, let them redound ever &s;o much to public utility, or private profit, the author of them is adjudged to have no ex|clu&s;ive right to the exerci&s;e of his invention or the u&s;e of his di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="11">It is indeed whim&s;ical that, in a <HI>&s;cientific</HI> age and <HI>commercial</HI> nation, a property in <HI>words</HI> &s;hould be held more &s;acred than a property in <HI>things</HI>; that an <HI>Arti&s;t,</HI> who has <HI>literature</HI> enough to give a <HI>verbal de&s;cription</HI> of the nature and de&s;ign of any newly-invented and u&s;eful machine, &s;hould be legally entitled to the &s;ole right of multiplying the copies of &s;uch <HI>de&s;cription,</HI> though he is denied &s;uch right of manufacturing or multiply|ing the copies of the <HI>Machine</HI> it&s;elf. This is &s;till more whim|&s;ical if we reflect, that &s;uch <HI>verbal de&s;cription</HI> may be only a matter of <HI>mere curio&s;ity,</HI> and the fir&s;t copy of it have been compo&s;ed with facility in a few hours; while the <HI>real in&s;tru|ment</HI> may be a &s;ubject of <HI>great utility,</HI> and its fabrication have co&s;t the inventor the &s;tudy, application and labour of years, to &s;urmount the difficulties attending its fir&s;t con&s;truction.</P>
<P>At a time, therefore, when the farther indulgence of the Legi&s;lature is &s;olicited in favour of <HI>literary property,</HI> and even that, which has been already granted by Statute, is thought by many an infringement of the natural rights of genius, the profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>u&s;eful arts</HI> will be wanting to them&s;elves if they neglect: the opportunity of laying claim to at lea&s;t an <HI>equal</HI> indulgence, founded on a plea of at lea&s;t equal validity.</P>
<P>Not that the <HI>U&s;eful Arti&s;t</HI> need re&s;t his cau&s;e &s;olely on <HI>com|parative</HI> merit, or found his preten&s;ions to a like indulgence on the Statute in favour of <HI>Literary Property.</HI> With equal claim to the natural rights of Genius, it is by no means diffi|cult to &s;upport his <HI>&s;uperior</HI> right to public encouragement on principles of political expediency.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12">At the &s;ame time, it is not pretended that this partial di&s;|tinction between the <HI>Author</HI> and the <HI>Artificer</HI> is altogether pe|culiar to this i&s;land. The practice of mo&s;t other nations, re|&s;pecting the <HI>common property</HI> of di&s;coveries and inventions in the u&s;eful arts, affords a &s;trong pre&s;umption that, even grant|ing a natural right of property in them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, it is either incapable of being a&s;certained and &s;ecured by Law, or incom|patible with the political intere&s;ts of the community: And it is in vain for individuals to talk of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a property which the law cannot a&s;certain and &s;ecure; or to contend for &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if it militate again&s;t the general intere&s;ts of Society.</P>
<P>How far a right of property in u&s;eful inventions and di&s;co|veries be founded in Nature, be capable of being protected by Law, or con&s;i&s;tent with the general good of a commercial people, becomes of cour&s;e the &s;ubject of di&s;qui&s;ition in the following pages.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="4" REF="13">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a <HI>NATURAL RIGHT</HI> of <HI>PROPERTY</HI> in new Inventions and Di&s;coveries in general.</HEAD>
<P>IN the late conte&s;ts about <HI>Literary Property</HI> much hath been &s;aid and written on the nature and origin of property in gene|ral. The common lawyers, wedded to words and forms, have bandied about the technical terms of <HI>corporeal</HI> and <HI>incorporeal</HI> till they have almo&s;t forgot their &s;imple u&s;e. It hath been proved, however, again&s;t them, that there are <HI>incorporeal</HI> rights as ea&s;ily a&s;certainable by law, and as ju&s;tly entitled to the protection of it, as others which are <HI>corporeal.</HI> Without entering therefore into the di&s;pute of the <HI>jus in re,</HI> or particu|larly di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the nature of the property contended for, I &s;hall enquire only how it originated and became the natural right of the claimant.</P>
<P>The Lawyers in general have not le&s;s perplexed the que&s;tion, re&s;pecting the <HI>origin</HI> of <HI>property,</HI> than they have puzzled that about the <HI>nature</HI> of it. Re&s;tricted by the narrow notions, which confine property to a <HI>corpus</HI> or body, they have recurred no farther back for a right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than <HI>prior occupancy</HI>; &s;etting di&s;coveries and inventions in literature and &s;cience on the &s;ame footing with the u&s;e and improvement of corporeal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Inventor</HI> may deduce a right of property to their re&s;pective labours from a &s;till earlier and more general &s;ource. Every man whom Providence &s;ends into the world hath a natural right to live in it; and, if to live in
<PB N="5" REF="14">
it, to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, however, the man who is born to no e&s;tate real or per&s;onal, finds the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion already en|gro&s;&s;ed by prior occupants; he is therefore of nece&s;&s;ity reduced to the creation of new means of livelihood; a right to all <HI>corporeal</HI> property being already &s;ecured to others, he mu&s;t have recour&s;e for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the <HI>incorporeal</HI> property he is en|dowed with by Nature in the u&s;e of his per&s;onal talents; he mu&s;t live by his wits or his labour. <HI>Steal</HI> he mu&s;t not, and if to <HI>beg</HI> he be a&s;hamed, &s;hall he be denied a right to the contriv|ance of his brain or the work of his hands? This were to af|firm, that the <HI>poor</HI> are the natural-born <HI>Slaves</HI> of the <HI>Rich</HI>; and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of corporeal property, however obtained, gives a right to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all other: an affirmation which, I pre&s;ume, no free-born &s;ubject of this country will venture to make.</P>
<P>It is indeed now very generally admitted, that a man can have no better natural right to any thing in the world, than to the fruits of his own ingenuity and indu&s;try; it were needle&s;s, therefore, to throw away time in confuting the ca&s;ui&s;try, by which the contrary opinion hath been maintained.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="15">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the pretended difference between <HI>AUTHORS</HI> and <HI>ARTIFICERS,</HI> regarding a right of property in their re&s;pective inventions.</HEAD>
<P>THE Advocates for <HI>Literary Property</HI> have laboured much to maintain as <HI>real,</HI> an <HI>imaginary</HI> difference, which they have &s;et up between the <HI>Author</HI> and the <HI>Artificer,</HI> in regard to an exclu&s;ive right of property in their re&s;pective compo&s;itions. Not that they had any valid plea to offer, in &s;upport of their argument; but becau&s;e the right of the <HI>Artificer</HI> being univer|&s;ally held untenable at Common-law, if they admitted the <HI>Author</HI> to &s;tand in the &s;ame predicament, they could not &s;up|port his claim to a <HI>perpetuity</HI> in his <HI>copy-right</HI>; which they mode&s;tly contended for.</P>
<P>The futility of the arguments, adduced to maintain this &s;uppo&s;ed difference between the inventors of machines and the authors of books, hath been &s;o fully di&s;played in &s;everal late publications and pleadings, that it were &s;uperfluous to at|tempt to corroborate what has been delivered with &s;o much equity and energy by the fir&s;t lawyers of this and perhaps any other nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be &s;ufficient to refer the reader, who is curious to peru&s;e them at large, to a pamphlet entitled, An Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Li|terary Property, publi&s;hed in 1762; to the late pleadings of the Court of Se&s;&s;ions in Scotland, the Speeches of Lord Camden and &s;everal of the Judges, on the Appeal and final determination of the cau&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">A certain celebrated writer, however, having &s;ince taken up the pen to urge a &s;imilar plea, it may not be ami&s;s to take &s;ome notice of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See A mode&s;t Plea for Copy-right, by Catharine Macaulay.</NOTE>. With the intention, &s;ays Mrs. Macau|lay, of depriving authors of the hone&s;t, the dear-bought re|ward of their literary labours, they have been rai&s;ed a little higher (in&s;tead of lower) than the Angels<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, page 17.</NOTE>, and at the &s;ame time been levelled with the Inventors of a very inferior Or|der. The&s;e <HI>inventors</HI> of an order <HI>very inferior</HI> to <HI>authors</HI> of <HI>books,</HI> are the <HI>authors</HI> of <HI>new inventions</HI> and di&s;coveries in the <HI>u&s;eful arts</HI>; who, it is a&s;&s;erted, would be better rewarded for their ingenuity than writers, even did they both &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing, in regard to time and other circum&s;tances, for the emoluments ari&s;ing from their different inventive fa|culties.</P>
<P>I know not how this ingenious writer will make good this a&s;&s;ertion; but I am per&s;uaded that, if the <HI>authors</HI> of &s;uch <HI>new inventions</HI> and <HI>di&s;coveries</HI> did &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing, in regard to a legal &s;ecurity of a right of property in their re&s;pective productions, as <HI>authors</HI> of <HI>books</HI> do, they would not complain of inju&s;tice or contend for a <HI>perpetuity</HI> in &s;uch right.</P>
<P>Every common capacity, &s;ays this writer, can &s;oon find out the u&s;e of a machine, which is not the ca&s;e with a book. I accede to the latter part of the a&s;&s;ertion, becau&s;e there are many books who&s;e u&s;e cannot be found out at all, as they are totally <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> if not hurtful: the former part I deny, for as good a rea&s;on. Had this advocate for literary merit been
<PB N="8" REF="17">
familiar with the labours of our mathematical, philo&s;ophical and even mechanic arti&s;ts, &s;he would have known that there are many curious and u&s;eful machines, with who&s;e u&s;e the very makers of them are totally unacquainted.</P>
<Q>It is a length of time (continues this author) before the value of a literary publication is di&s;covered and acknow|ledged by the vulgar; and even, when the merits of a work of this kind, in regard to the hone&s;t intentions of the writer, and the execution of the compo&s;ition, is in general allowed, the malice of party-prejudice and that leaven of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which prevails in the characters of the greater number of individuals, may, for a long term of years, keep back the &s;ale of a book, which teaches an offen&s;ive doctrine or tells di&s;agreeable truths to the public.</Q>
<P>I hope the writer does not &s;peak experimentally on this occa&s;ion, as I am ready to go &s;till farther in favour of de|&s;erving <HI>authors.</HI> It is not only to the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of individuals and the prejudice of party we may impute the keeping back the &s;ale of a good book; it may al&s;o be imputed to ignorance, inattention or want of ta&s;te in the Public, in general: from which cau&s;es, the more curious, refined and in&s;tructive the book, the longer it will be before it attract &s;ufficient notice to obtain a general &s;ale.</P>
<P>If I do not mi&s;take, no le&s;s than &s;even and twenty years elap&s;ed before Sir I&s;aac Newton's <HI>Principia</HI> came to a &s;econd edition: and I may cite Mrs. Macaulay's own authority for &s;aying, that when Lord Bacon publi&s;hed his Philo&s;ophical Ideas, they were &s;o little under&s;tood that they were deemed
<PB N="9" REF="18">
literary lumber: nay, that the learned and Royal James, whom the Earl of Shaftelbury terms the &s;chool-ma&s;ter of his people, compared them to the ways of God, pa&s;t finding out.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame predicament may al&s;o the la&s;t book of New|ton's <HI>Principia</HI> be &s;aid to &s;tand, even with mo&s;t of our be&s;t mathematicians to this very day.</P>
<P>This is undoubtedly a good argument for extending the term at pre&s;ent limited by &s;tatute in literary copy-right. There are certainly many laborious and expen&s;ive works, who&s;e &s;ale during that term will by no means compen&s;ate the authors or undertakers, for the inten&s;e &s;tudy, long labour, and immen&s;e co&s;t attending their execution.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame argument holds equally good with re&s;pect to the authors of new inventions and di&s;coveries, in the arts and &s;ciences; many of which are effected only by amazing appli|cation, tedious proce&s;s and prodigious expence. And yet the <HI>author</HI> thinks eight and twenty years too &s;hort a term, in which to reap the benefit of his labours, while the <HI>arti&s;t</HI> or <HI>artificer</HI> is not entitled, by any law in being, to a property in the effects of his ingenuity for a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P>I will not cen&s;ure the impropriety with which the above|mentioned writer calls the latter an inventor of a <HI>very in&s;e|riour</HI> order; I beg leave, however, to remind the reader that it is not in the capacity of <HI>writers</HI> that either Bacon or Newton, particularly the latter, lays claim to public vene|ration. The genius of Newton was not of a <HI>literary</HI> ca&s;t, nor does he rai&s;e our admiration or command our re&s;pect &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="19">
much as an <HI>author,</HI> as he does in the capacity of an <HI>inventor</HI> or <HI>arti&s;t.</HI> The &s;uperiority of his character is not derived from his &s;uperior talents in turning periods and making <HI>books,</HI> but in &s;olving geometrical problems, making phy&s;ical experiments and manufacturing pri&s;ms and optic-gla&s;&s;es. It is Sir I&s;aac Newton the <HI>mathematician,</HI> the <HI>experimentali&s;t,</HI> the <HI>mechanic,</HI> and not the <HI>writer,</HI> who&s;e name is &s;o highly honoured and tran&s;mitted with &s;o much renown to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It was to this great philo&s;opher in the&s;e capacities al&s;o, that the re&s;pect paid to him when living, and the emoluments he reaped in con&s;equence of it, are more immediately to be at|tributed: and &s;hall the ingenuity of tho&s;e talents which made his fortune in life, and confer immortality on his name after death, be held <HI>very inferiour</HI> to his literary abilities; which were at be&s;t on a level with mediocrity?</P>
<P>Locke hath remarked it, as a circum&s;tance affecting to a &s;peculative mind, that a rational being &s;hould be employed all day long, like a mere mechanical machine, in &s;awing a block of marble.

<P><PB N="11" REF="20">It is hinted by the writer abovementioned, that <HI>authors</HI> claim a greater indulgence of the legi&s;lature than other <HI>arti&s;ts,</HI> becau&s;e their writings tend to the improvement of the human mind, whereas the productions of inventors of an <HI>inferivur</HI> order, &s;erve only to promote the purpo&s;es of luxury, or at be&s;t to furni&s;h tho&s;e conveniences which are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the comforts of life.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the political expediency of giving public encouragement to <HI>INVENTIONS</HI> and <HI>DISCOVERIES</HI> in the <HI>ARTS</HI> and <HI>SCIENCES,</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be thought needle&s;s to urge any other argument, to prove the political expediency of encouraging improvements in arts and &s;ciences, than the univer&s;al practice of enlightened and well-regulated &s;tates. Among commercial nations in particular, the &s;uperiority which the one acquires over the other, is univer&s;ally allowed to re&s;ult from a &s;uperior degree of ingenuity and indu&s;try in its re&s;pective inhabitants. It is the&s;e that give ri&s;e to improvements in agriculture, manu|factures and commerce, and are the inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources of national wealth and political happine&s;s.</P>
<P>While a &s;pirit of emulation, therefore, prevails between &s;tates, as among individuals, it becomes the national intere&s;t, and thence the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of Government to promote a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, and fo&s;ter the &s;eeds of ingenuity; not only among the &s;uperior cla&s;s of authors and arti&s;ts, but al&s;o among the lower order of arti&s;ans, mechanics, mariners and hu&s;bandmen.</P>
<P>The favourites of the Mu&s;es and &s;uch of the higher order of inventors, who&s;e thir&s;t of glory or natural curio&s;ity &s;uf|ficiently animate them to exploits of genius; the&s;e, I &s;ay, need no &s;timulation to urge them forward in the pur&s;uits of
<PB N="14" REF="23">
fame or knowledge. It is to &s;uch, however, that Government has been frequently liberal, as if it were laudably nece&s;&s;ary to make a generous provi&s;ion for tho&s;e who devote their talents di&s;intere&s;tedly to the &s;ervice of the public, without regard to their private emolument. With the generality of mankind, neverthele&s;s, whatever be their inventive talents or intellectual capacity, a principle of &s;elf-intere&s;t is the ruling motive of action, and the only con&s;tant &s;timulative to the exertion of their private abilities for the public &s;ervice. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not that the greate&s;t of our poetical geniu&s;es have been in&s;en&s;ible to pe|cuniary emoluments; even Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, as a brother bard ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>For gain, not glory, wing'd his tow'ring flight,</L>
<L>And grew immortal in his own de&s;pight.</L></Q></NOTE> Hence it is that a reward proportional to the merit of that &s;ervice &s;hould ever be held forth, for their encouragement.</P>
<P>As to mere labour, though it &s;hould not, as Virtue is &s;aid to be, left merely to its own reward, it certainly &s;hould be, as Virtue generally is, rewarded but moderately. Men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no property and capable of nothing but labour, are en|titled to nothing but the means of daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Were they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more they would remit their daily labour; &s;o that a numerous body of indu&s;trious poor is a fund of real wealth to the community. But the reward of ince&s;&s;ant la|bour, and that of indu&s;trious ingenuity &s;hould be different; the per&s;everance of the <HI>labourer</HI> providing merely for the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of the individual or of a few; while the indu&s;try of the <HI>inventor</HI> provides for the convenience of hundreds, the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of thou&s;ands, and the &s;upport of the State. The differ|ence, which Nature hath thus made among men, and which
<PB N="15" REF="24">
is infinitely more &s;triking and characteri&s;tical than the gew|gaw di&s;tinctions of civil &s;ociety, gives them a real title to pre|eminence. The marks of &s;uperior talents are indelible proofs of their rightful claim to &s;uperior re&s;pect and con&s;ideration. It is hence with the utmo&s;t inju&s;tice that the ignorant and in|dolent Great blend the artificer and the labourer together, and confound them indi&s;criminately with the refu&s;e of man|kind.</P>
<P>With the <HI>labourer</HI> may al&s;o be ranked the retailer of &s;imple commodities, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion, requiring the meane&s;t of na|tural talents, &s;hould be as little profitable as po&s;&s;ible, con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;upport of a family employed in dome&s;tic du|ties, or engaged like him&s;elf in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing, it is true, is more common than to &s;ee an opu|lent retailer live luxuriou&s;ly him&s;elf and maintain his family in idlene&s;s, out of profits oppre&s;&s;ively wrung from the hard hands of the labourer, or in&s;idiou&s;ly derived from the in|ventive brain of the arti&s;an; but where the channels of con|&s;umption are not increa&s;ed by the increa&s;ing number of tra|ders, their multiplicity becomes a burthen to the &s;tate, and their extravagance a political evil of the mo&s;t fatal tendency. The&s;e therefore merit no encouragement that may &s;erve to in|crea&s;e their number, which is already become a public nui|&s;ance.</P>
<P>With venders of their own manufactures, cultivators of their own or other mens' lands, and with traders of a &s;upe|rior cla&s;s, by whom the Art of Commerce it&s;elf is almo&s;t im|proved into a Science, the ca&s;e is different. As patrons and
<PB N="16" REF="25">
promoters of the u&s;eful arts in general, they merit every en|couragement which the law can &s;ecure or mini&s;terial policy be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Again, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h not only between the merits of different cla&s;&s;es of arti&s;ts, but between the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>nominal</HI> arti&s;ts of the &s;ame cla&s;s: between the Manufacturer, for in&s;tance, who merely copies and vends the inventions of others, and he who fabricates and vends his own. Any pe|culiar encouragement, given to the former, tends to e&s;tabli&s;h a monopoly injurious to traders in general; but without &s;uch encouragement being given to the latter, the &s;pirit of invention is checked, ingenuity droops, and the want of improvement in the commodities of &s;ale prove equally injurious to trade it&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the Legi&s;lature have in &s;ome in&s;tances looked on the expediency of giving public encouragement to u&s;eful inven|tions and di&s;coveries in the &s;ame light, is obvious. The par|liamentary rewards, that have been offered and paid for the finding out the Longitude, for the method of making &s;alt|water fre&s;h, for a no&s;trum for the Stone, and for &s;everal other inventions and di&s;coveries, afford a &s;ufficient proof that the encouragement of ingenuity, by rewarding the authors of &s;uch inventions and di&s;coveries, is in general adjudged to be politically expedient.</P>
<P>From the many objections, therefore, that have been &s;tarted to almo&s;t every &s;uch particular encouragement, it is pre&s;umed that exceptions mu&s;t have been taken either to the nature and extent of it, or to the method in which it has been
<PB N="17" REF="26">
be&s;towed; I &s;hall for this rea&s;on proceed to take a view of the &s;everal modes in which &s;uch encouragement hath been offered and given, and endeavour, by obviating tho&s;e objections, to point out a method of be&s;towing it in &s;uch a manner, as may be lea&s;t hurtful to individuals and mo&s;t conducive to the ends propo&s;ed; viz. the contributing to the conveniencies and em|belli&s;hments of life, and the facilitating future improvements in the produce, manufactures and commerce of our country.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the methods, which have hitherto been taken, to encourage improvements in the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>AS the fir&s;t of the&s;e methods I rank <HI>parliamentary premiums,</HI> being the mo&s;t liberal and be&s;t becoming the character of an opulent and powerful people.</P>
<P>To this method, however, may be made many objections, as well on the part of the public, who&s;e money is thus be|&s;towed; as on the part of the <HI>Arti&s;t,</HI> or <HI>inventor,</HI> who is to receive it, as a compen&s;ation for his labour or ingenuity. The expence and difficulty of obtaining it may be grievous to the one, as that of granting it may be burthen&s;ome to the other; while the <HI>quantum</HI> of it will always run the ri&s;k of being in|adequate either to the utility of which the invention may prove to the public, to the merit of the di&s;covery, or to the pains which the author may have taken to bring it to per|fection;
<PB N="18" REF="27">
whereas &s;uch premium &s;hould be ever adapted to all three.</P>
<P>We have a remarkable in&s;tance of all the&s;e circum&s;tances united in the affair of Mr. Harri&s;on's contrivance for finding out the Longitude. There is no doubt that the ingenious contriver, after the &s;ucce&s;s of forty years application, de&s;erved the reward to which he was entitled. It was yet with diffi|culty he obtained it; and, though it might be deemed ade|quate to the pains he had taken, and the ingenuity of his contrivance; it is indubitable that the di&s;covery of his inven|tion hath proved of little utility in Navigation. I do not find his clock is ever likely to become of general and common u&s;e, as the encouragement given by &s;o ample a compen&s;ation &s;eems to require.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o, that Mrs. Stevens's famous medicine for di&s;&s;olving the Stone, for the di&s;covery of who&s;e compo&s;i|tion the Legi&s;lature granted five thou&s;and pounds, however efficacious before, has cured hardly any body fince it was made public.</P>
<P>I will not call in que&s;tion Mr. Irwin's method of making &s;alt|water fre&s;h; but am well a&s;&s;ured that the di&s;covery of as &s;imple and &s;peedy a proce&s;s might have been purcha&s;ed for le&s;s money.</P>
<P>There is indeed no little danger that both the <HI>quantum</HI> and the facility of obtaining of parliamentary premiums, may de|pend as well on per&s;onal intere&s;t as on particular ingenuity, or public utility. The merit of the incomparable Hogarth is univer&s;ally acknowledged, and yet it will hardly be denied
<PB N="19" REF="28">
that an u&s;eful arti&s;t of equal ingenuity hath &s;ome right to complain, that he is entitled to no property in his inventions, when the widow of that ingenious engraver was indulged with an additional term of twenty years' copy-right in the de|&s;igns of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band, over and above the fourteen years that had already been enjoyed by virtue of the Statute.</P>
<P>The indulgence, lately granted by Parliament to the pro|prietors of that elegant pile of building, the Adelphi, to di&s;|po&s;e of their property by way of Lottery, appears to have given very general di&s;gu&s;t. It is to be hoped the like favour, be&s;towed on the ingenious Mr. Cox. to di&s;po&s;e of his Mu|&s;eum, will give more &s;atisfaction. But, whatever merit might ju&s;tly recommend the&s;e Arti&s;ts to parliamentary indulgence, this method, of giving public encouragement to the Authors of new inventions, is &s;o liable to be perverted by partiality or prejudice, that it can, by no means, be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy to permit the indi&s;criminate application of individuals to be indulged in the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Of the petty premiums pre&s;ented by the Societies for the Encouragement of Arts and manufactures, &s;upported by po|pular &s;ub&s;cription, I &s;hall &s;ay but little, as indeed but little is to be &s;aid, In&s;tituted on public-&s;pirited principles, but per|verted by private cabals, the laudable purpo&s;es of their in&s;ti|tution have been &s;eldom attained. In the mean time, we hear the candidates for their premiums as clamorous in their complaints of inju&s;tice done to their merit, as &s;evere in their invectives again&s;t the want of knowledge or candour in tho&s;e who are to judge of it. It is with the&s;e, as with all other mixed &s;ocieties; however unanimous and moderate in their
<PB N="20" REF="29">
commencement, like the parts of an heterogeneous fluid, the more &s;olid and important &s;ub&s;ide, while the volatile and in|&s;ignificant ri&s;e uppermo&s;t and float con&s;tantly on the &s;urface. The more &s;en&s;ible and judicious of the members remain &s;ilent or retire; leaving the bu&s;ine&s;s of the a&s;&s;ociation to be tran&s;|acted by the empty, the ignorant and the vain.</P>
<P>From &s;uch &s;ocieties, therefore, little good, and &s;till le&s;s per|manency in the admini&s;tration of it, is to be expected. If par|tiality and prejudice al&s;o may be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the great council of the nation, how much more may &s;uch an unwhole|&s;ome leaven be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the fermenting particles of &s;o prepo&s;terous a compound!</P>
<P>As an e&s;&s;ential part of the criterion, by which the quantity and quality of public encouragement, proper to be given to arti&s;ts and inventors of any kind, is the public utility of their compo&s;itions and inventions, it is indeed highly improper that the <HI>quantum</HI> at lea&s;t of &s;uch. encouragement, &s;hould be de|termined before &s;uch utility be eventually decided.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plau&s;ible and politic method of be&s;towing that encouragement is, therefore, that by which the eventual uti|lity of &s;uch inventions is made the mea&s;ure of reward. This is effected either by ve&s;ting a legal right of property in the inventor, as in the ca&s;e of writers, engravers, &amp;c. or by the grant of Letters-patent from the crown, as in the ca&s;e of ma|thematical arti&s;ts, chemical experimentali&s;ts, artificers and manufacturers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the &s;imilarity of predicament between the practitioners of the <HI>SCIENTIFIC</HI> and <HI>MECHANIC</HI> arts, and the profe&s;&s;ors of the arts of <HI>DESIGN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have already endeavoured to &s;hew that <HI>authors,</HI> who prac|ti&s;e rather the <HI>imitative</HI> than the <HI>inventive</HI> arts, (at lea&s;t all but tho&s;e few writers, who&s;e productions are truly <HI>original</HI>) have not a more natural right to the proprietary indulgence, granted them by the legi&s;lature, than have the <HI>artificers,</HI> who&s;e in|ventions and di&s;coveries are really <HI>new</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful.</HI> I am not a little flattered to find an opinion, long &s;ince &s;ugge&s;ted by my own reading, coincident with a late reflection of that great luminary in law and equity, Lord Camden.</P>
<P>I &s;hall beg leave to expatiate here, therefore, &s;omewhat more diffu&s;ely on the impropriety of that di&s;tinction, which the legi&s;lature hath made between the practitioners of the <HI>u&s;eful</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>polite</HI> arts, and of the injurious par|tiality of the law in regard to their right of property in their re&s;pective productions.</P>
<P>But perhaps, the &s;tate of dereliction and oppre&s;&s;ion, under which the <HI>u&s;eful arts</HI> at pre&s;ent labour, proceeds rather from involuntary neglect than de&s;ign. Inventors and artificers have been wanting to their own intere&s;ts, in not applying, like authors and book&s;ellers, for a <HI>copy-right</HI> in their inventions and compo&s;itions. Time has been when <HI>literary arti&s;ts</HI> were
<PB N="22" REF="31">
obliged, as others are now, to purcha&s;e a temporary property in their works, with letters-patent from the Crown: nay, the u&s;e of the pre&s;s it&s;elf was once held dependant on royal prerogative. <HI>Writers</HI> have been emancipated from &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;lavery; the pre&s;s hath been laid open and, on appli|cation to the legi&s;lature, authors and their a&s;&s;igns have been ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive right of property in their productions. Nay, practitioners in the arts of de&s;ign, and, as I conceive, compo&s;ers of mu&s;ic too are inve&s;ted with a &s;imilar right. Shall the authors then of chemical di&s;coveries, the inventors of mathematical in&s;truments, the contrivers of e&s;&s;ential im|provements in manufactures; &s;hall the&s;e, I &s;ay, he&s;itate to follow the example, or doubt of obtaining &s;imilar redre&s;s?</P>
<P>On principles of equity no rational objection can be made to it, nor indeed on any other ground without arguing in|ferior merit from &s;uperior utility: and hard indeed were the ca&s;e of indu&s;trious ingenuity if its de&s;ert &s;hould defeat its reward.</P>
<P>The <HI>polite</HI> arts, it is true, make a more &s;plendid and im|po&s;ing appearance; they a&s;&s;ume a dignity and importance, which may &s;eem to give them a right to property and &s;upport; but it is merely on the pre&s;umptuous plea by which a reduced and beggarly <HI>noble&s;&s;e</HI> infer from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of empty titles, a right to the luxuries of life, while they indolently eat the bread of idlene&s;s.</P>

<P>But, granting that <HI>authors,</HI> under the au&s;pices of the Mu&s;es and the &s;pecious pretence of improving the human mind by their writings, are entitled to greater encouragement than other arti&s;ts, the merit of <HI>engravers, etchers</HI> and <HI>mezzo|tinto-&s;crapers,</HI> &s;urely places them in the &s;ame predicament, in the eye of rea&s;on, with that of practitioners in the other manual arts&punc; It cannot be pretended that the labour of the engraver of a print or the copyi&s;t of a picture in <HI>chiaro o&s;curo,</HI> is either more ingenious or u&s;eful than that of the contriver of a mathematical in&s;trument or mechanical machine. And yet the <HI>engravers</HI> and <HI>mezzotinto-&s;crapers,</HI> following the example of the <HI>authors,</HI> obtained by degrees, an equal indulgence from the Legi&s;lature to an exclu&s;ive right of property in their labours.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to trace the proceeding of the&s;e fa|voured arti&s;ts in their &s;ucce&s;sful attempts to obtain this de|&s;ired indulgence.</P>

<P>Nay, &s;o little idea of copy-right have the latter in their re&s;pective labours, that they di&s;regard even the privilege of a patent in the hands of other arti&s;ts, under pretence that their manufacture is not of new invention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t this is the plea, which I have &s;een advanced in the public prints, again&s;t the validity of the patent of tho&s;e ingenious and excellent arti&s;ts Me&s;&s;ieurs Wedgwood and Bentloy, for taking off the &s;igures of antique models in a <HI>terra-cotta</HI> peculiar to them&s;elves.</NOTE>.

<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible that, in the contracted view of a narrow|minded politician, a thou&s;and imaginary difficulties will attend the adoption of the expedient propo&s;ed: but things are not impracticable or improper merely becau&s;e they are difficult. If the u&s;eful arts have this claim on the ju&s;tice of the com|munity, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that the adopting it will have a good effect on its public intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>As general reflections, however, tend not to convince tho&s;e who can rai&s;e only particular exceptions, I &s;hall examine into the validity of a few of the mo&s;t &s;triking objections.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t difficulty, that pre&s;ents it&s;elf again&s;t the granting an exclu&s;ive privilege to the authors of new inventions in the u&s;eful arts, is the general one of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>monopolies</HI>; which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the pernicious effects of enrich|ing a <HI>few,</HI> and depriving a <HI>multitude</HI> of the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; of enhancing the price of the manufactures monopolized; and thence of cour&s;e proving injurious to dome&s;tic oeconomy and foreign commerce.</P>
<P>As to <HI>monopolies,</HI> it is an odious word without a determi|nate meaning. In its legal &s;en&s;e, as de&s;ined by Hawkins, Black&s;tone and others, it has no proper reference to <HI>new in|ventions</HI> in the <HI>u&s;eful arts.</HI> <Q>Monopolies, &s;ays Black&s;tone,
<PB N="32" REF="41">
are much the &s;ame offence in other branches of trade, that engro&s;&s;ing is in provi&s;ions; being a licence or privilege, allowed by the King, for the &s;ole buying and &s;elling, making, working or u&s;ing, of any thing what&s;oever, whereby the &s;ubject in general is re&s;trained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading which he had before. The&s;e had been carried to an enormous height, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and were heavily complained of by Sir Edward Coke, in the begining of the reign of King James the fir&s;t: but were in a great mea&s;ure remedied by &s;tatute 21. Jac. I. c. 3. which declares &s;uch monopolies contrary to law and void; except as to patents, not exceed|ing the grant of fourteen years, to the authors of new inventions.</Q></P>
<P>It was owing (as that very eminent lawyer very ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves) to the <HI>enormous height</HI> to which tho&s;e royal grants were carried, in the time of Elizabeth and James, that the act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them. It was owing al&s;o to the ju&s;t re&s;entment of the two hou&s;es of parliament, again&s;t the violent &s;tretch of the prerogative, by which they ro&s;e to that height, that they lo&s;t &s;ight of the real object of that re&s;ent|ment; falling into the ab&s;urdity of in&s;erting a clau&s;e, except|ing <HI>new inventions,</HI> in an act to re&s;train <HI>monopolies</HI>; with which new inventions had nothing to do.</P>
<P>For, if a monopoly be only a licence or privilege for the &s;ole buying, &s;elling, making, working or u&s;ing of a thing, whereby the &s;ubject in general is re&s;trained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading <HI>he had before,</HI> it is plain that the &s;ubject is <HI>not</HI> &s;o re&s;trained by any exclusive privilege granted to
<PB N="33" REF="42">
the author of a new di&s;covery, produce, invention or &s;pecies of manufacture, which the &s;ubject in general COULD NOT <HI>manufacture,</HI> and in which of cour&s;e he DID NOT <HI>trade</HI> before.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the effects of exclu&s;ive privileges, in <HI>enriching</HI> a <HI>few</HI> per&s;ons, <HI>impoveri&s;hing</HI> others, and keeping <HI>multitudes poor</HI>; the circum&s;tance is in&s;eparable from new inventions, di&s;coveries and improvements. Till it be determined good policy, therefore, for a nation not to encourage &s;uch inventions and improvements, the private intere&s;t of individuals mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give way to that of the public.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that a <HI>&s;cientific</HI> or even <HI>practical</HI> arti&s;t &s;hould invent a machine, by means of which one man might be capable of doing the work of a thou&s;and; &s;hould not his invention be encouraged becau&s;e a number of labourers would be to &s;eek for employment? It is hard, no doubt, for poor men, who are as dull and uninventive as they are poor, to be obliged at an advanced period of life, to turn their hands to a &s;pecies of labour to which they are not accu&s;tomed. But this plea might be urged again&s;t almo&s;t all u&s;eful improvements whatever; mo&s;t of them tending to expedite mechanical operation and render manual labour cheap. Hence machines, to &s;ave or expedite &s;uch labour, are encouraged in allwell-governed &s;tates. What, indeed, would be the con&s;equence if in any one they were not? Would not the neglected inventors of &s;uch machines repair to other &s;tates, where they might meet with de&s;erved encouragement? And would not the &s;tate, in which labour &s;hould be cheape&s;t and manufactures mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly fabricated, have, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the advantage of others at all foreign markets. About &s;ixty years ago, if I mi&s;take not, application was made
<PB N="34" REF="43">
to parliament for encouragement to certain individuals for erecting mills for the &s;awing of timber. It was oppo&s;ed by the petition of a numerous body of &s;awyers; compa&s;&s;ion for who&s;e families prevented &s;uch encouragement then taking place. We have been contented &s;ince to pay to the Dutch and other nations, many hundred thou&s;and pounds, for the &s;awing of timber; which they have earned by the &s;ame kind of mills, that might otherwi&s;e been erected in this kingdom.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature indeed have, of late years, &s;een into this impolicy; but, tho' they indemnified Mr. Dingley, for what lie &s;uffered by the indi&s;cretion of the populace in de&s;troying his &s;aw mill at Limehou&s;e, they have not as yet thought it expe|dient to give &s;ufficient encouragement for the erection of more.</P>
<P>It is certain that, upon every <HI>new</HI>-invention or e&s;&s;ential improvement in any &s;pecies of manufacture, the manufac|turers in the <HI>old-way,</HI> in that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, will be cla|morous again&s;t an exclu&s;ive privilege being granted to the im|prover or inventor; but &s;hould this have any weight with the legi&s;lature? The dulle&s;t and mo&s;t uninventive arti&s;an in the world, bearing the name of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion or occupa|tion, may thence claim aright to equal emoluments with the mo&s;t expert and ingenious of his vocation; but would it be either ju&s;t or politic to admit his claim? I have before hinted at the difference which nature it&s;elf hath made, and of con|&s;equence &s;ound policy &s;hould make, between tho&s;e who have <HI>ingenuity</HI> to <HI>contrive,</HI> and tho&s;e who have only <HI>&s;trength to labour.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 14.</NOTE></P>

and even reap &s;ome profit by it adequate to its merit. In the mean time, however, the &s;uperior &s;trength and lightne&s;s of the wheels of this manufacture, giving them a preference to all others, the common wheel-wrights, for the pre&s;ent, labour under a hard&s;hip, from which, tho' they have a right to a&s;k relief of the legi&s;lature, they have none to complain of the inventor, or of the exclu&s;ive privilege he enjoys by his patent. Many in&s;tances of a &s;imilar nature might be pointed out among&s;t the ingenious artificers of this kingdom.</P>
<P>I have indeed already ob&s;erved, that the be&s;towing of par|liamentary premiums, for di&s;coveries and inventions, who&s;e utility is problematical, is a very improper mode of encou|raging ingenuity, for the rea&s;ons then a&s;&s;igned. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 18.</NOTE> Tho&s;e rea|&s;ons do not oppo&s;e the giving &s;uch premiums for inventions, who&s;e utility is publicly experienced.</P>
<P>As to the pretext, that grants of exclu&s;ive property or privi|lege in the exerci&s;e of new inventions, tend to enhance the price of the newly-invented manufactures; it may be an&s;wered that, as &s;uch grants do not compel any one to purcha&s;e the&s;e new manufactures, the public are left at liberty, at the lower price, to encourage the <HI>old</HI>: and this they will certainly do, neglecting the <HI>new,</HI> if their &s;uperiority of merit be not adequate to the advance of price.</P>
<P>But it hath been &s;aid, of patentees in particular, that their privileges tend to throw advantages into the hands of foreign|ers; who, not being re&s;tricted by our patents, can fabricate
<PB N="37" REF="46">
and carry &s;uch new and improved manufactures to market, cheap&egrave;r than our countrymen the patentees.&mdash;When they who advance this objection, can bring one &s;ingle in&s;tance to corro|borate their affection, I &s;hall think it merits a reply. Till then I hold it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, in favour of patentees in ge|neral, that, as it is their intere&s;t to extend the u&s;e and &s;ale of their commodities as much us po&s;&s;ible, it becomes their intere&s;t al&s;o, to vend them as cheap as they can well be afforded. At the &s;ame time, it may not be improper to add, that the &s;ooner their patent or exclu&s;ive privilege of property expires, the higher the price will they be induced to &s;et on them: whereas the longer the term of their privilege, the cheaper can they afford and will therefore be induced to &s;ell them.</P>
<P>It will be objected perhaps (for every trifling difficulty will be made an objection) that, if Arti&s;ts and Artificers in general, were put on the &s;ame footing as Authors and En|gravers, claiming an exclu&s;ive property in their new produc|tions, on the &s;ame ea&s;y terms of publication or entrance of their claim in &s;ome public office, the pretenders to &s;uch claims would be &s;o numerous, and the pretended inventions of many, &s;o &s;rivolous, that it would give ri&s;e to endle&s;s vexa|tious &s;uits and litigations. But to this it may be replied that, the increa&s;ing number of pretenders to new inventions would be a proof that the encouragement offered, had an&s;wered the end of it, by awakening the &s;pirit of ingenuity and indu&s;try; and would give ground to hope that, out of &s;o many pre|tenders, &s;ome might de&s;erve encouragement.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who&s;e inventions were really new, or who&s;e improvements were e&s;&s;entially u&s;eful, the point of right
<PB N="38" REF="47">
would be &s;oon &s;ettled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For it will hardly be pretended that the claim, dependant on a preci&s;e mode of &s;pecification, which is now &s;ecured by patent, could not be equally as well &s;ecured by act of parliament. I have indeed given an in&s;tance, in which the right of the Engraver, &s;ecured by Statute, is admitted even by tho&s;e who conte&s;t a &s;imilar right &s;ecured by patent. See page 26.</NOTE>: Whereas with &s;uch contrivances as were futile and frivolous, the point of right would be &s;oon found not worth contending for, either by the invader or defender: So that this kind of litigation would &s;oon be at an end.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the curio&s;ity of Genius would be awaken|ed, its indu&s;try rou&s;ed, and the &s;pirit of enterprize reviv|ed. The ingenious, though indigent artificer, would not then be deterred from pro&s;ecuting a favourite and u&s;eful pur&s;uit. from the con&s;ideration that he could not rai&s;e money to purcha&s;e a patent, &s;hould he &s;ucceed in his endea|vours, and that he was only racking his brains for the emolu|ment of others. A proper di&s;tinction would be then made between the <HI>inventive artificer</HI> and the <HI>uninventive arti&s;an,</HI> tho&s;e who are qualified to employ others, and tho&s;e who are capable only to work them&s;elves. The re&s;pect due to each would be a&s;certained, their due degree of encouragement pointed out, and every branch of the arts and &s;ciences flou|ri&s;h, while the trunk would be nouri&s;hed by being properly watered at the root.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the re&s;traint laid on the <HI>KING'S PREROGATIVE</HI> from giving encouragement to <HI>USEFUL ARTISTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM not to learn that exclu&s;ive privileges, whether by par|liamentary grant or royal prerogative, are extremely unpopu|lar; or that they are particularly obnoxious to the penurious Great; who, in&s;tead of grudging the artificer the reward of his ingenuity, &s;hould be the fir&s;t mo&s;t liberally to encourage it. Unhappily indeed, both for ingenuity and indu&s;try, the &s;uperior privilege, of being born to <HI>do nothing,</HI> induces &s;uch highly-favoured mortals to conceit that their inferiours were born to do, for nothing, every thing for them. Hence the &s;ituation of indu&s;trious ingenuity at pre&s;ent, reminds one of the &s;tate of &s;lavery under which the Egyptians held the I&s;|raelites of old; whom their in&s;olent ta&s;k-ma&s;ters required to make brick, without furni&s;hing them with &s;traw.</P>
<P>It hath been before ob&s;erved that &s;uch privileges do not compel the public to purcha&s;e new manufactures; there is, therefore, le&s;s rea&s;on for wealthy individuals to complain again&s;t them, than artificers and traders who&s;e private intere&s;t may be materially affected. At the &s;ame time if we reflect that, without the encouragement of &s;uch exclu&s;ive privileges, no new inventions or improvements of any considerable con|&s;equence can be expected, the oppo&s;ing them is not le&s;s im|politic and ab&s;urd, than illiberal and unju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49">And yet, notwith&s;tanding all that may be both politically and equitably urged, in behalf of giving a general parliamen|tary encouragement to new inventions, and placing ingenious arti&s;ts <HI>of all kinds</HI> on the &s;ame footing, I am not without ap|prehen&s;ions, that the policy, of the times may be &s;ound too pu&s;ilanimous to carry &s;o &s;alutary a mea&s;ure into execution.</P>
<P>But, though neither rea&s;on nor ju&s;tice &s;hould prevail &s;o far as they ought, I flatter my&s;elf with the hope that a power, of <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>readily</HI> rewarding indu&s;trious ingenuity, may be lodged &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>In other countries (as it was in <HI>this,</HI> before the pa&s;&s;ing the act again&s;t monopolies) a di&s;cretionary power is placed in the hands of Government, to give &s;uch encouragement by ex|clusive privileges for a term of years; which may be renewed or extended according to the exigencies or peculiar merits of the ca&s;e. In England this power, held univer&s;ally el&s;ewhere to be &s;till inherent to the dignity of the &s;overeign, was abridged by the Statute before mentioned of the 21&s;t of James I. It may not be improper, therefore, in this place to enquire a little into the motives and propriety of this abridgment of the Royal Prerogative. With this view I &s;hall beg leave to cite the following pa&s;&s;age from Black&s;tone's Commentaries.</P>
<P>"On the acce&s;&s;ion of King James I, no new degree of royal power was added to, or exerci&s;ed by him; but &s;uch a &s;ceptre was too weighty to be wielded by &s;uch a hand. The unrea&s;onable and imprudent exertion of what was then deemed to be prerogative, upon trivial and. unworthy occa&s;ions, and the claim of a more ab&s;olute power inherent in the kingly-office than had ever been carried into practice, &s;oon awakened
<PB N="41" REF="50">
the &s;leeping lion. The people heard with a&s;toni&s;hment doc|trines preached from the throne and the pulpit, &s;ubver&s;ive of liberty and property, and all the natural rights of humanity. They examined into the divinity of this claim, and found it weakly and fallaciou&s;ly &s;upported: and common rea&s;on a&s;&s;ured them, that, if it were of human origin, no con&s;titution could e&s;tabli&s;h it without power of revocation, no precedent could &s;anctify, on length of time could confirm it. The leaders felt the pul&s;e of the nation, and found they had ability as well as inclination to re&s;i&s;t it: and accordingly re&s;i&s;ted and oppo&s;ed it, whenever the pu&s;illanimous temper of the monarch had courage to put it to the trial; and they gained &s;ome little victories in the ca&s;es of concealments, MONOPOLIES and the di&s;pen&s;ing power."</P>
<P>It appears, from the above &s;tate of the ca&s;e, that this re|&s;traint on the king's prerogative was laid at a time, when the people, alarmed for their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and valuable pri|vileges, were in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with the Crown; of who&s;e encroachments they were, to the highe&s;t degree jealous, and who&s;e exertions of power they were determined on every oc|ca&s;ion to oppo&s;e. Their fears excited, their pa&s;&s;ions heated, and their re&s;entinent rou&s;ed again&s;t real injuries, it is no wonder their di&s;cretion was not &s;uffciently on its guard to prevent their encountering imaginary ones.</P>
<P>Not that many of the royal monopolies then e&s;tabli&s;hed were not injurious, oppre&s;&s;ive and de&s;erving aboli&s;hment: but they might, and doubtle&s;s would at any other period, have been aboli&s;hed without depriving the prerogative of one of the brighte&s;t jewels of the Crown. For &s;uch we may
<PB N="42" REF="51">
ju&s;tly term the power of patronizing ingenuity and promoting the arts of civil life.</P>
<P>But the rage of reformation, as I have before ob&s;erved, &s;tifled the reflection that the exerci&s;e of <HI>new inventions</HI> were not <HI>monopolies</HI> in that &s;en&s;e, which had thrown on the word an odium, continued to this day. The times, however, are altered, and though new inventions remain de&s;titute of proper encouragement, we &s;ee monopolies, of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive ten|dency, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the combination, and &s;ometimes even the &s;eparate influence, of opulent individuals, not only without being countenanced by the crown, but even directly contrary to the mo&s;t expre&s;s and po&s;itive acts of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Change of times will ju&s;tify change of mea&s;ures. So far is the nation at pre&s;ent from hearing any <Q>doctrines preached from the throne or the pulpit &s;ubver&s;ive of liberty, property and the natural rights of humanity</Q> as in the time of James I, that we have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend an abu&s;e of any additional power, that may be re&s;tored to the crown re&s;pecting this part of its prerogative.</P>
<P>Should it be judged, therefore, at pre&s;ent inexpedient to grant, or be found through popular prejudice impracticable to obtain the general parliamentary encouragement above|mentioned; it is to be hoped the legi&s;lature will have no objec|tion to repeal the clau&s;e in the afore&s;aid act of the 21&s;t of James 1. re&s;tricting the grants of the crown by patent to the term of fourteen years.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52">Certain, indeed, it is that there are &s;ome pretended im|provements and inventions &s;o trivial and u&s;ele&s;s, that their authors do not merit an exclu&s;ive privilege to exerci&s;e or profit by them a &s;ingle day: but this is far from being the ca&s;e with <HI>all.</HI> The term of fourteen years, however is &s;o &s;hort, that few inventors chu&s;e to a&s;k for le&s;s, and it is not at pre&s;ent in the power of the crown, if any de&s;erve it, to grant more. It is this circum&s;tance which eventually and in fact pre|vents any di&s;tinction being made between the encouragement given to the mo&s;t difficult, expen&s;ive and important of &s;uch inventions, and the mo&s;t obvious, in&s;ignificant and trivial.</P>
<P>A number of in&s;tances might be particularized, in which the grant, of an exclu&s;ive right for fourteen years only, is greatly inadequate and di&s;proportional to the ingenuity, labour, expence and utility of &s;uch inventions: but, the legi&s;lature it&s;elf having acknowledged it by particular grants of premiums to inventors, even after the expiration of the term of their patents, it is pre&s;umed needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t farther on what is &s;o manife&s;tly expedient and equitable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;tice, however, to a mo&s;t u&s;eful invention and the ingenious con|triver of it, I cannot forbear in&s;tancing Mr. Hartley's expedient for preventing hou&s;es taking fire, by lining the cielings with thin plates of iron; a method &s;o extremely &s;imple and efficacious, that one would imagine, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;ity, it need only to be &s;een to be adopted. But if we reflect on the unac|countable &s;ecurity of inattention and indolence, which every day's experience teaches us, we &s;hall not be inclined to wonder if fourteen or even forty years elap&s;e before it come into &s;ufficient u&s;e to make the inventor any compen&s;ation equal to its merit. This gentleman, therefore, certainly de&s;erves an exclu&s;ive privilege for a much longer term than fourteen years, or a pre&s;ent parliamentary premium, adequate to the importance and utility of his invention.</NOTE>. How far what I have written may tend to excite <HI>u&s;eful arti&s;ts</HI> to apply for redre&s;s, or
<PB N="44" REF="53">
induce the legi&s;lature to grant it, time will determine: but, be the con&s;equences what they may, I lay down the pen well &s;atisfied with having te&s;tified my inclination to promote the cau&s;e of indu&s;trious ingenuity, and in that the general intere&s;ts of my country.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing &s;trictures on certain &s;ingular con&s;equences, attending the late deci&s;ion on <HI>LITERARY PROPERTY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the copious and ma&s;terly manner, in which the &s;ubject of literary property hath been lately treated, as well in the Court of Se&s;&s;ions in Scotland, as in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it may be deemed impertinent to think any farther animad|ver&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary. But a circum&s;tance or two, to which it was not the immediate bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;peakers to pay atten|tion, leading to con&s;equences that appear &s;trangely incon|&s;i&s;tent with modern practice, I am induced to take the pre&s;ent opportunity of noticing them.</P>
<P>By the &s;olemn deci&s;ions in the courts abovementioned, de|nying the <HI>perpettuiy</HI> of &s;uch property and re&s;ting copy-right merely on the &s;tatute, the practice of the Court of Chancery, in granting injunctions again&s;t pretended pirates and invaders of &s;uch property, is materially affected.</P>
<P>If authors have no foundation for copy-right at common-law, the proceedings in equity mu&s;t be founded &s;olely and &s;trictly on the &s;tatute; by which it does by no means appear that <HI>ab&s;tracts, abridgements</HI> and <HI>compilations</HI> (of which the greater number of the new books now published con&s;i&s;t) are at all contrary to law.</P>
<P>It is to little purpo&s;e to determine whether literary pro|perty be <HI>temporary or perpetual,</HI>) unle&s;s the <HI>nature</HI> of that pro|perty
<PB N="46" REF="55">
be al&s;o preci&s;ely determined. In the works of original writers, &s;uch as Shake&s;peare, Milton, &amp;c. this property is &s;ufficiently a&s;certained; but for one original writer that ap|pears in the republic of letters, there are five hundred copyi&s;ts and compilers. Their number al&s;o of nece&s;&s;ity encrea&s;es, as books are multiplied: nor can it well be otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s all improvements in literature be precluded. <HI>Nil dictum quod non dictum prius,</HI> was &s;aid near two thou&s;and years ago. With how much more propriety therefore may it be &s;aid at pre&s;ent? In hi&s;torical writings and books of &s;cience of any extent, ori|ginality cannot be pretended to; and, if compilations, ab|&s;tracts and epitomes are to be no longer allowed, the paper-|mills may &s;top, the printing-pre&s;s &s;tand &s;till, and its numerous retainers be obliged literally to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>It hath been long the cu&s;tom in the Court of Chancery to grant-injunctions again&s;t the printers and publi&s;hers of hi|&s;torical and other compilations, under the pretence of &s;taying wa&s;te; in con&s;equence of which, an injunction <HI>ex parte</HI> is granted; by which the publication is &s;topped, till, after every &s;tudied delay of exception to the defendant's an&s;wer, the complainant's bill is on hearing di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and the injunction di&s;&s;olved; when it is frequently impracticable to re&s;ume the publication, and the author or book&s;eller is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;itting down with the lo&s;s attending an imperfect work, with that of a procra&s;tinated and litigious law-&s;uit into the bargain.</P>
<P>The practice of the Court of Chancery teems with &s;uits of this kind; in which the complainant waves his right to &s;uch
<PB N="47" REF="56">
damages as he might claim under the act of parliament, al|though he often confe&s;&s;edly grounds his bill on that act; ap|plying in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the Chancellor, to who&s;e hands the deci&s;ion, of what is or is not &s;ecurable property in every book, is thus transferred.</P>
<P>Another inconvenience, &s;till le&s;s attended to and more &s;in|gular than the above, ari&s;es from confining the right of li|terary property merely to the &s;tatute; and this is, that in &s;uch ca&s;e this right it&s;elf, being conditional; <HI>viz.</HI> depending on the entry of the book or pamphlet in the hall book of the Company of Stationers; an author, who does not comply with this condition, the &s;tatutory <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of his copy-right, can have no preten&s;ions to &s;uch right at all. So that an au|thor hath in fact no copy-right in an <HI>unentered manu&s;cript</HI>; which any per&s;on may therefore, openly or &s;urreptitiou&s;ly copy publi&s;h for his own profit at plea&s;ure. Macklin, the player, &s;ome time &s;ince, obtained an injunction, and on a hearing got damages, of Richard&s;on the book&s;eller, for printing and publi&s;hing part of the farce of <HI>Love A-la-Mode</HI>; which the latter employed Gurney to take down at the theatre in &s;hort-hand. But &s;ince the late deci&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Lords and the reference of copy-right only to the <HI>&s;tatute,</HI> I pre&s;ume no &s;uch injunction in Chancery can be granted. In what a predieament then &s;tand the authors of unpubli&s;hed manu&s;cripts, particularly our Engli&s;h Ari&s;tophanes, Mr. Foote, &s;everal of who&s;e performances are unpubli&s;hed, and it is nece&s;&s;ary to the emoluments of his theatre that they &s;hould remain &s;o? Will it not be expedient for him, and every other profe&s;&s;or of unpubli&s;hed manu&s;cripts, to enter
<PB N="48" REF="57" MS="y">
them without delay in the hall-book of the Company Or will indeed &s;uch entry without the actual printing and publi|cation of the work &s;uffice? I cannot help thinking that &s;ome difficulty attends she &s;olution of the&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons hoped, that as the legi&s;lature will probably find it expedient to make &s;ome farther alteration in the laws relating to literary property, &s;ome farther regulation re&s;pecting the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of it will be deemed con&s;i&s;tent with it's wi&s;dom, more preci&s;ely to determine the limits of its appro|priation, &s;o that both writers and book&s;ellers may know how far they are authorized to abridge, copy or make quotations from the works of their predece&s;&s;ors; without which they cannot &s;afely exerci&s;e their calling, and all improvements in works of <HI>hi&s;tory, philology</HI> and <HI>&s;cience</HI> mu&s;t &s;peedily have an end.</P>
