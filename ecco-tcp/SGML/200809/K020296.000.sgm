<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Hold it an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to mention &s;ome Circum&s;tances, which gave Birth to the follow|ing Scenes, wherein I &s;hall not only indulge my Pride, but, perhaps, in &s;ome Degree, palliate the Boldne&s;s, and (as it may be thought by many) Pre&s;umption of my Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Fable and Conduct of this Tragedy were projected as long ago as the Year 1761, by <HI>the late</HI> Mr. <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> at his &s;weet Retirement, the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> Herein con&s;i&s;ts my Pride, that I enjoyed a happy (but too &s;hort) Intimacy with that amiable and accompli&s;hed Man.</P>
<P>In the Summer of that &s;ame Year, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI>'s Letter, No. 105, to Mr. <HI>Graves, Sept.</HI> 14, 1761.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Shen|&s;tone</HI> had been pre&s;ent at the Performance of a ha&s;ty Alteration of Mr. <HI>Hawkins'</HI>s Tragedy of <HI>Henry and Ro&s;amond,</HI> which I produced at the Theatre at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> for the temporary U&s;e of a particular Friend. Undige&s;ted and imperfect as it was, that excellent Judge &s;aid, there was a Pathos in the Story, which, notwith&s;tanding the Defects of the Drama,
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
made the Repre&s;entation very plea&s;ing; and he &s;ignified his Wonder that &s;uch an affecting and <HI>popular Tale</HI> &s;hould not have found its Way to the Stage. Hence aro&s;e many Conver&s;ations on the Subject, all which terminated in his advi&s;ing me <HI>to make the Story my own.</HI> The known Kind|ne&s;s of his Heart, perhaps, gave me Credit for greater Abilities, than I really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He con|tinued to encourage me with a Warmth which flatters me in the Pecollection; and, after I had left <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> obliged me with &s;everal Let|ters to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, which I &s;till pre&s;erve as <HI>valuable Relicts.</HI></P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e Letters he &s;ugge&s;ted the Cha|racter of the <HI>Abbot;</HI> in Order, as he &s;aid, to add a little more Bu&s;ine&s;s to a Story, which otherwi&s;e might be too barren to furni&s;h Matter for five Acts. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed I forthwith adopted his Idea, and carefully trea&s;ured in my Mind every Sentiment he let fall on this, as well as other Subjects; and I can &s;ay, with great Truth, that among the many Conver&s;ations I en|joyed with that excellent Man, I never knew one from which I did not derive con&s;iderable In|&s;truction, as well as Delight.</P>
<P>The unexpected Lo&s;s of this mo&s;t e&s;timable Friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died <HI>Feb.</HI> 11, 1763.</NOTE> (which will ever be lamented by all who knew him) di&s;pirited me from the Undertaking,
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
and I laid a&s;ide my Plan, together with all his Letters, till the Beginning of la&s;t Year. The Scheme it&s;elf, it is true, had often, in the Inter|val, occurred to my Remembrance, but a Doubt of my Ability to execute it, even in a <HI>pa&s;&s;able</HI> Manner, deterred me from the Attempt.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Thea|tre, and the warm Solicitations of a Friend, in|duced me once more to re&s;ume the De&s;ign. The happy <HI>Suitability</HI> (if I may be allowed the Phra&s;e) of her Figure, to the De&s;cription of <HI>Ro|&s;amond</HI> (as may be found in Dr. <HI>Percy</HI>'s amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive Collection of old Ballads, Vol. ii. Page 137) viz.
<Q><L>Her cri&s;ped Lockes, like Threads of Golde,</L>
<L>Appear'd to each Man's Sight;</L>
<L>Her &s;parkling Eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q>
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Softne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of her Demeanour, encouraged me, at length, to make the Attempt; and the unniverfal Aprobation given by the Public to her Appearance, Manner and Performance, on the fir&s;t Repre&s;entation of this Play, happily convinced me I was not &s;ingular in my Opinion.</P>
<P>In the general Execution of the Piece I have paid a particular Attention to the <HI>old Ballad,</HI> and endeavoured at a Simplicity of Style, both which Mr. <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> earne&s;tly recommended. I am not con&s;cious of any further Helps, except having
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
adopted the Idea (not the Matter) of an Interview between the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Clifford</HI> in the Mona&s;tery, from Mr. <HI>Hawkins.</HI></P>
<P>I had originally made <HI>Clifford</HI> die of a broken Heart, under the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ction of the Death of <HI>King Lear,</HI> as originally drawn by that great Ma&s;ter of human Nature. <HI>Shake&s;peare;</HI> but the general Opi|nion of the Public, and the Per&s;ua&s;ions of my Friends, induced me to vary my De&s;ign in the Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>I have little further to add, but my Intreaties that the Reader will be plea&s;ed to judge with Le|nity, what was undertaken with Diffidence.</P>
<P>Advi&s;ed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and encouraged as I was ori|ginally, to this Undertaking, by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;uch eminent Abilities, and &s;uch Benignity of Di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;eek no <HI>living</HI> Patron, but pride my&s;elf in having this Opportunity to dedicate my humble Production,</P>

<HEAD>CRITIQUE on Part of the PLATES in BELL's Edition of SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>Excellent engraving is a beauty of it&s;elf, and will always to the generality of people appear an ornament, independent of the de&s;ign, or other qualities, of a good print. The French &s;eem to have under&s;tood this better than any other nation.</P>
<P>In imitation of the magnificent editions of the Louvre, they have bedecked their ordinary books with cuts, &s;ignets, meda|lions, head and tail pieces; in the execution of which lies all their merit. Neatne&s;s and propriety &s;trike at once a &s;uperfi|cial eye, and therefore aiding their language with <HI>the bagatelles</HI> I have mentioned, the Parifians are thought to have &s;old more books than any three cities in Europe.</P>
<P>An edition of Shake&s;peare's acting plays being lately adver|ti&s;ed, I had the curio&s;ity to glance at the propo&s;als, but coming to that part of the adverti&s;ement, where five volumes, with <HI>elegant plates,</HI> are offered for fifteen &s;hillings, I pitied Shake|&s;peare, and thought no more of the work. They are now pu|bli&s;hed, and afford a happy in&s;tance of what the public are to expect from a book&s;eller, who has &s;pirit to &s;hare his profits with arti&s;ts of merit. I had often thought of writing &s;ome|thing
<PB REF="90">
upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and cannot, without inju&s;tice, pa&s;s this new edition in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>With exception of one or two at mo&s;t, the&s;e plates are highly fini&s;hed, fini&s;hed with freedom and force, united to the admired neatne&s;s of the French <HI>Burin.</HI> I am &s;orry the de&s;igns are not, upon the whole, equal to the execution&punc; though many of them merit the highe&s;t applau&s;e; and &s;ince I have criti|ci&s;ed the plates of former editions, I &s;hall make equally free with the pre&s;ent, and prai&s;e or blame, where, in my opinion, either is de&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Othello</HI> gives no idea of the noble Moor. The expre&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y is too ambiguous and &s;trong to be marked with &s;uc|ce&s;s in miniature; he looks not like an injured &s;oldier, but an old enraged eunuch of the &s;eraglio. <HI>Iago</HI> is an excellent figure, his action &s;teady, the attitude &s;peaks de&s;ign, and the eye watches the effect of his villany upon the unhappy hu&s;band.</P>
<P><HI>Brutus</HI> and the <HI>Evil Genius</HI> would not make the gho&s;t of a Roman between them; it is a bad print, and no part of it better than another.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;alind</HI> and her companion, in the comedy of <HI>As you like it,</HI> is one of the &s;weete&s;t cuts I remember to have &s;een; the action is well cho&s;en, the expre&s;&s;ion ju&s;t, and the execution delicate as the &s;ubject. The &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;ex &s;hines through the ma|&s;culine dre&s;s, and finely conveys the idea of the poet. Had the trees in the back ground been executed with a little more care, and the keeping better pre&s;erved, this print would have been a ma&s;ter-piece.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with <HI>Pi&s;tol</HI> in <HI>Harry the fifth:</HI> the de&s;ign is good, the action natural&mdash;the expre&s;&s;ion &s;trong, and the execution &s;uperior to any poetical cut I ever &s;aw in an Engli&s;h publication.</P>
<P><HI>Iachimo</HI> and <HI>Imogen</HI> de&s;erve great approbation; the &s;eene is dumb &s;how, therefore capable of being perfectly repre&s;ented: accordingly, the <HI>&s;ang-froid</HI> of the Italian, taking an inventory of the lady's beauty, is nicely hit&mdash;&s;he &s;leeps well; her po|&s;ture is natural, and the execution fle&s;hy and delicate.</P>
<P>The delivery of the letter in <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; there is a great deal of character in the king and <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> and what is further commendable, they are portraits of the&s;e per&s;onages. <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> receives the letter with a courtly &s;mile, in place of that &s;tupefaction vi&s;ible in the Car|dinal of Gravelot, before its contents were known.</P>
<P><HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> a&s;&s;uming the conque&s;t of <HI>Percy,</HI> is a plea&s;ant high-fini&s;hed cut; <HI>Sir John</HI> recalls rather too much the idea of Mr. Shuter in that part, but the youth and gallant figure of the prince is happily &s;truck, and the fallen <HI>Percy</HI> judiciou&s;ly fore|&s;hortened. I think he &s;hould have retained &s;omething of the terrible in death.</P>
<P><PB REF="91">
<HI>Doctor Caius, Mrs. Quickly,</HI> and <HI>Simple,</HI> in the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> are truly comic, well conceived, and convey the very &s;pirit of the &s;cene; the execution is equal to the de&s;ign, and make together a very perfect print.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Grignion</HI> has been very happy in the fronti&s;piece for <HI>Much ado about Nothing&mdash;</HI>His etching gives a peculiar &s;pirit to a print, where he is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow pains and the arch &s;mile in the face of the prince and <HI>Leonato,</HI> in pretended con|ference, demands the attention of an actor.</P>
<P>The feelings of old <HI>Lear,</HI> are finely marked; the figure, though &s;mall, is dignified; and poor <HI>Tom</HI> almo&s;t &s;hivers upon the paper.</P>
<P>I could with plea&s;ure review the others, but have already exceeded the &s;hort &s;ketch intended. The &s;ubject of prints is fertile and entertaining. I could wi&s;h to &s;ee it treated by tho&s;e who have more lei&s;ure and abilities than I am ma&s;ter of. Their merits might thence become more generally under&s;tood, and the art rendered of &s;olid u&s;e and ornament to the works of the learned.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent publication I con&s;ider as a con&s;iderable ad|vance to this improvement, and the public will likely view it in the &s;ame light.</P>

After bringing his &s;cholar as far as the a&s;&s;ault, and having demon&s;trated to him all the thru&s;ts and various parades, he lays down rules for defence in all &s;orts of &s;word-play."

<P>The GENTLEMAN's POCKET FARRIER, &s;hewing how to u&s;e your hor&s;e on a journey; and what remedies are proper for common accidents that may befal him on the road.</P>
<P>This little tract has been in great e&s;timation, for the&s;e fifty years pa&s;t, and has gone through many edition in Ireland. The remedies it pre&s;cribes, are &s;imple, and ea&s;ily obtained, and never fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l of cure, where the di&s;order is curable.

<P>ADVERTISEMENT.</P>
<P>It may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader, that the&s;e pre&s;criptions have not been ha&s;tily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many books have been written on farrlery, of which Gib&s;on's is undoubtedly the be&s;t, but his rules are too tedious for the pocket. Such a book therefore as this, is nece&s;&s;ary on a journey, in order to refer to as oc|ca&s;ion requires; and it contains as much as is known by any of our common farriers.</P>
<P>As &s;mall as this tract may appear, it will be found to inform gentlemen, fir&s;t, what methods are be&s;t to be u&s;ed, if their hor&s;es fall lame. Secondly, what medicines are proper to give him when &s;ick. Thirdly, how to direct the operations, and e&s;cape the impo&s;itions, of ignorant men. In &s;hort, by the help of this treati&s;e, gentlemen will be able to prevent a groom or farrier from injuring their hor&s;es, by improper applications, and mi&s;taking one di&s;temper for another.</P>
<P>The receipts are few, naked, and cheap; the poultice but one, and con|trived on purpo&s;e to prevent trouble, and &s;ave time and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ges, by pointing out the be&s;t remedies at fir&s;t, &s;uch as are ea&s;ie&s;t to be got, and &s;uch as make the &s;peedie&s;t cures: and the reader may be a&s;&s;ured that they have been expe|rimentally confirmed, by a practice of thirty years. The book is drawn up in a manner calculated for a gentleman's pocket, &s;uppo&s;ing him upon a jour|ney; and no man, who values his hor&s;e, &s;hould travel without it.</P></ITEM>
