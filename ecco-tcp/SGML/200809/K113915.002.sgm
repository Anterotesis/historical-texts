<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. A Reinforcement of fre&s;h Troops arrives from Holland&mdash;En|campment on Mount Magdenberg, in Tempatee Creek&mdash; Remarkable In&s;tance of Lunacy in a Negro&mdash;Mountains &mdash;Beautiful Views&mdash;The Sick &s;ent to Europe.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW once more return to the principal object of my Journal, <HI>viz.</HI> Fourgeoud's military operations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVI.</NOTE> I have before mentioned, that a &s;upply of fre&s;h troops was ex|pected to reinforce our decayed little army; and, on the 30th of January, 1775, the news came to Paramaribo that the tran&s;port &s;hip Maa&s;troom, Captain Eeg, was arrived in the river Surinam, and come to an anchor before the fortre&s;s Am&s;terdam, with Colonel Seyburgh and two divi|&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting together of one hundred and twenty men, under his command, two more divi&s;ions being expected.</P>
<P>The following day I went down with a row-boat to welcome them; and having dined on board together, the
<PB N="2" REF="7">
&s;hip weighed anchor, and I &s;ailed up with them till before the fortre&s;s Zelandia, where they moored, and were &s;alut|ed by a few guns. Among the officers, I with plea&s;ure recollected my old &s;hip-mate, poor En&s;ign He&s;&s;eling, whom we had left behind us on the Helder, according to every appearance dying of the &s;mall-pox, when we &s;ailed from the Texel, the 24th of December, 1772. This young man, who now joined us with rank of &s;e|cond lieutenant, had been peculiarly unfortunate &s;ince his recovery; for, &s;oon after taking a pa&s;&s;age on board another &s;hip for Surinam, the ve&s;&s;el encountered a gale in the Bay of Bi&s;cay; when off Cape Fini&s;terre, her quarter-gallery and rudder were beat away; be|&s;ides which &s;he lo&s;t her fore-ma&s;t and main-top-ma&s;t. In this dangerous condition, having the wind again&s;t her for Li&s;bon, the ve&s;&s;el run with difficulty into Plymouth. From this place Mr. He&s;&s;eling took a pa&s;&s;age for France, on board a &s;mall &s;loop loaded with coals, with which he had no better &s;ucce&s;s; for &s;he ran, through the inad|vertence of the ma&s;ter, on the Ca&s;kets, which rocks went through her bottom, and &s;he foundered immediately. Be|fore the ve&s;&s;el &s;unk, however, he had time to break open his che&s;t, and take out &s;ome linen and other nece&s;&s;aries, with which he arrived in a crazy yaul at Bre&s;t. He now took &s;hipping again for Am&s;terdam, on board a Dutchman; but the ma&s;ter ran the &s;hip a-ground, and he had nearly been once more wrecked. Neverthele&s;s he arrived &s;afe at the Texel, whence he had twice in vain attempted
<PB N="3" REF="8">
to &s;et out for South America; and on this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age it blew &s;o violently hard, that all the boats, the &s;heep, the pigs, and the poultry, were wa&s;hed overboard. Till this date I had been the olde&s;t officer in the corps, except|ing only Colonel Fourgeoud.</P>
<P>On the arrival of the troops, our commander invited them to a dinner, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;alt beef, pork, barley, and hard pea&s;e, of which I had the honour to partake, to my no &s;mall amu&s;ement, when I ob&s;erved the &s;ignificant looks which, were directed by the&s;e new|comers on their commander and his entertainment. In the evening we conducted them to the play-hou&s;e, where the death of Cae&s;ar, and Cri&s;pin Doctor, were performed, the one exactly as laughable as the other. I mu&s;t how|ever confe&s;s, that I was better entertained the next day, when the governor gave to all a &s;uperb dinner and &s;up|per, where the &s;trangers &s;eemed to be as much &s;urpri&s;ed with the magnificence of the fea&s;t, as they had been the day before amazed with Colonel Fourgeoud's fru|gality.</P>
<P>Having met at this table with &s;ome excellent pre|&s;erved fruits, among which was the <HI>guava,</HI> I will em|brace an opportunity which is barren of incident to &s;ay &s;omething of it. The guaba, or guava-tree, grows to about twenty-four feet high, with leaves like tho&s;e of a plum-tree. It is light-coloured, and the wood of little con&s;equence; but the fruit, which is yellow, oval, and
<PB N="4" REF="9">
about the &s;ize of a gold pippin, inclo&s;es a reddi&s;h pulp, full of &s;mall &s;eeds; the pulp is very &s;weet, and may be eaten raw, or made into marmalade or jelly, and then it is delicious. There are two &s;pecies of guava; that which is the &s;weete&s;t has the &s;malle&s;t quantity of &s;eeds.</P>
<P>On the 5th of February, the troops that were &s;o lately landed were &s;ent to the upper parts of the river Come|wina to be encamped. I &s;peak of the privates, for mo&s;t of the officers remained to partake of a fea&s;t at the hou&s;e of a Mr. Mercellus; by who&s;e command (to crown the banquet) half a dozen negroes continued blowing the trumpet and French horn in the room where we dined, till the company were ab&s;olutely deafened by di&s;cordancy and noi&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 6th, the whole corps, without exception, re|ceived orders to leave Paramaribo, and to encamp at Mag|denberg, a mountain near the Tempatee Creek, in the upper parts of the river Comewina, to which, as I have ju&s;t mentioned, the reinforcement was already di&s;patched. Having, therefore, prepared my&s;elf to &s;et out on my fourth campaign, and taken leave of my little family and friends, I repaired to the water &s;ide, to &s;et out in the &s;ame barge with Colonel Seyburgh, but who, erroneou&s;ly &s;up|po&s;ing that the troops which came with him from Hol|land were a di&s;tinct corps from tho&s;e arrived with Four|geoud in 1773, made the negroes &s;hove off the boat in my pre&s;ence, when I was not a &s;tone's ca&s;t from it, and left

me on the beach, to my utter &s;urprize and mortification. I knew Fourgeoud had &s;wore that he &s;hould
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"dance ju&s;t as much to his pipes as the younge&s;t en&s;ign in the re|giment;"</Q>
and in that he was perfectly right: I there|fore &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported the chief again&s;t his antago|ni&s;t, and &s;etting off immediately with another boat, &s;oon overtook him, to his a&s;toni&s;hment, when we all went a&s;hore at the plantation Vo&s;&s;enburgh, in the river Come|wina. The next day we came to the e&s;tate Arentru&s;t, having pa&s;&s;ed the heavy barges that departed from Para|maribo on the 5th; and on the 10th we made the Hope, where having &s;pent &s;o many months, I here pre&s;ent the reader with a view of that e&s;tate, and of the e&s;tate Cla|renbeek, where &s;till our ho&s;pital was kept. This day Co|lonel Fourgeoud al&s;o came up the river, and &s;lept at Wajampibo.</P>
<P>On the 11th, we arrived at the plantation Crawa&s;&s;ibo, where we pa&s;&s;ed the night. Here the over&s;eer, a Mr. De Bruyn, was &s;o very impertinent, that, as I already had no abundance of affection for the fraternity of over&s;eers, I gave him &s;uch a &s;ound beating that, with a bloody face, he &s;uddenly decamped from the e&s;tate in a &s;mall canoe with one negro, and in this trim, at twelve o'clock at night, like Banquo the gho&s;t, appeared before the amazed Fourgeoud; who thought proper to give him no other con&s;olation than to di&s;mi&s;s him with a hearty cur&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 12th we arrived &s;afe at Magdenberg, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
Fourgeoud, the officers, and the barges with the privates. From the Hope, the e&s;tates now began to appear thinner; and after pa&s;&s;ing Goet-Accord, about ten or twelve miles farther upwards, not a cultivated &s;pot was to be &s;een, the plantations having been all laid in a&s;hes by the rebels in 1757, as I have already mentioned, a &s;mall place excepted, ju&s;t below Magdenberg, which is, I think, called the <HI>Jacob,</HI> and where a few negroes are kept to cut timber. The river above Goet-accord becomes very narrow, being lined on each &s;ide with impenetrable bru&s;h-wood, like the river Cottica, between Devil's-Harwar and Patamaca; and the Tempatee Creek, which may be con&s;idered as the &s;ource of the whole river Comewina, becomes al&s;o much narrower. Magdenberg, which is about a hundred miles from Paramaribo, was formerly an e&s;tate, but has now not a ve&s;tige of cultivation left, a poor old orange-tree excepted, and is at pre&s;ent neither more or le&s;s than a barren de&s;olate mountain.</P>
<P>Here we found the &s;urface of the earth in &s;ome places covered with a kind of &s;trata, that had the appearance of mother-of-pearl, and lay &s;cattered in &s;mall &s;cales, about the &s;ize of an Engli&s;h &s;hilling. In many places of Suri|nam are found the marks of fo&s;&s;ils and ores, as I have already hinted. Indeed, iron ore is common, and I have no doubt but gold and &s;ilver mines might be met with if the Dutch would be at the expence, and per&s;evere in making the di&s;covery. I have already mentioned the Marawina diamond, and white and red agate, which are
<PB N="7" REF="13">
often &s;een in the upper parts of the river Surinam. On this mountain we al&s;o found the air cooler and more pure, and of cour&s;e more healthy than in any other part of the colony.</P>
<P>On the 17th the news reached us, that the tran&s;port &s;hip, the Maria Helena, with the remaining two divi&s;ions of one hundred and twenty men, commanded by Captain Hamel, had al&s;o arrived in the river Surinam on the 14th in&s;tant. Thus the reinforcements together con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred and forty men, and, on the 5th day of March, they all arrived in heavy barges at Magdenberg, where I may now &s;ay that Colonel Fourgeoud's whole forces were a&s;&s;embled. The &s;ame day one hundred negro &s;laves al&s;o arrived, to carry the loads when we &s;hould march. One of the new negroes being mi&s;&s;ed from on board a military barge, and marks of blood di&s;covered in it, the commanding officer, a Mr. Chatteauview, and a &s;entinel, were both put under an arre&s;t to be tried for murder. On the &s;ame eventful day al&s;o, two of our cap|tains fought a duel, in which one of them received a wound in his forehead.</P>
<P>On the 13th, a barge with provi&s;ions, coming from Pa|ramaribo (&s;hocking to relate!) found the negro that was mi&s;&s;ed on the 5th at the water's edge, lying in the bru&s;h|wood, with his throat cut from ear to ear, but &s;till alive, the knife having mi&s;&s;ed the wind-pipe. This mi&s;erable apparition of &s;kin and bone they took on board, and
<PB N="8" REF="14">
brought to Magdenberg, where, by a &s;kilful &s;urgeon; Mr. Knolaert, the wound was &s;ewed up, and the man &s;urpri&s;ingly recovered, having lain nine days in that dreadful condition without any &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or covering whatever, and weltering in his own blood, even without a bandage. The week after I had nearly lo&s;t my own life by an accident. Two negroes of the e&s;tate Goet-Accord being employed in hunting and fi&s;hing for Fourgeoud, one of them, named <HI>Philander,</HI> propo&s;ed to me to accom|pany them in the wood, where we might chance to meet with &s;ome <HI>pingoes,</HI> or <HI>powe&s;a</HI>; but a heavy &s;hower of rain coming on, when we had only walked two miles, we de|termined to relinqui&s;h the project, and repair to the &s;mall &s;pot called the Jacob for &s;helter, to gain which we were obliged to pa&s;s through a deep mar&s;h. Having waded till up to our arm-pits, Philander, who was the fine&s;t man without exception that I ever &s;aw, began to &s;wim, as did his companion, with one hand, holding their fowling pieces above the water with the other, and de&s;ired me to follow them. This I tried, having nothing on but my &s;hirt and trow&s;ers; when, after &s;wimming two or three &s;trokes, I &s;unk to the bottom like a &s;tone, with the weight of my mu&s;quet; but relinqui&s;hing it, I im|mediately ro&s;e to the &s;urface, and begged that Philan|der would dive for it; who having &s;ecured his own to a mangrove, brought it up without difficulty. At this mo|ment a thundering voice called out through the thicket,
<PB N="9" REF="15">
&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who <HI>&s;omma datty?</HI> and another <HI>&s;ooto &s;ooto da Bonny kiry da dago?</HI> Who is that? Who is there? Fire! &s;hoot! it is Bonny, kill the dog!"</Q>
&mdash;and looking up, we &s;aw the muzzles of &s;ix mu&s;quets pre&s;ented upon us at a very little di&s;tance indeed. I in&s;tantly dived, but Philander an&s;wer|ing that we belonged to Magdenberg, we were permitted to come on &s;hore one by one at the Jacob, and found that the&s;e tru&s;ty negro &s;laves, having heard a flouncing in the water, and &s;eeing three armed men in the mar&s;h, took it for granted that the rebels were coming, headed by Bonny him&s;elf, for whom they had mi&s;taken me, being almo&s;t naked and &s;o much &s;un-burnt; be&s;ides my hair, which was &s;hort and curly, I entirely re&s;embled a mulatto. Being refre&s;hed with &s;ome rum, and having dried our|&s;elves by a good fire, we now returned back to the Mag|denberg, where I congratulated my&s;elf on my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>On the 19th, Colonel Fourgeoud being now &s;upplied with fre&s;h troops, &s;ent a whole &s;hip load of invalids to Holland, who &s;ailed this day; and on February the 26th, my dear friend Heneman al&s;o &s;ailed for Holland, in an extremely debilitated &s;tate.</P>
<P>Among the troops which &s;ailed at the &s;ame time with Heneman were &s;everal officers, not very &s;ick, but ju&s;tly di&s;heartened and di&s;gu&s;ted at Fourgeoud's inju&s;tice, in having &s;topped their preferment, as I have intimated in the end of the tenth chapter; while they now &s;aw them|&s;elves &s;uper&s;eded by raw youths, who were at &s;chool
<PB N="10" REF="16">
at the time they were &s;erving the colony in 1772. With this ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed al&s;o the officers whom he had put under an arre&s;t, the 16th December, 1774. Never was an ho&s;|pital &s;hip &s;o ill provided with refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, Fourgeoud reviewed with plea&s;ure his recruited little army, where I was &s;orry the rangers did not appear. He now di&s;patched one hundred men as a patrole to reconnoitre the &s;kirts of his new en|campment, of which number I had the honour to be one. During this time nothing remarkable happened, except meeting with a large company of <HI>quatas,</HI> which being one of the mo&s;t remarkable &s;pecies of monkies in the world, from their affinity to the human race, I cannot tacitly pa&s;s over. One evening walking with my black boy Quaco without the camp, they came down &s;o low to look at us, and threw &s;mall &s;ticks and excrements at us, that we &s;topped, and I had an opportunity thoroughly to examine them. The <HI>quata,</HI> or <HI>quato,</HI> is very large, with an enormous tail: their arms and legs being covered over with long black hair, they make a very hideous appear|ance indeed; the more &s;o, as the creature's face is quite naked and red, with deep &s;unk eyes, which gives it much the appearance of an old Indian woman. It has &s;hort ears, and only four fingers without a thumb on its hands or fore feet, but it has five toes on the hinder feet, all of which have black nails. The extremity of its tail has a &s;piral turn inwardly; it is naked and callous, by its fre|quently
<PB REF="17">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="11" REF="18">
hanging to the branches of the trees; for when &s;o employed, it &s;erves the animal as a fifth limb. Mo&s;t wonderful is the agility of the&s;e monkies in &s;winging from one tree to another, but I never &s;aw them leap. Their throwing &s;hort &s;ticks and excrements &s;eems to be no more than a mimicking of the human actions without any purpo&s;e, as they neither have &s;trength to throw far, nor dexterity to hit their objects, and if they befoul them it is by accident only. But what appears peculiarly remarkable is, that when one is hurt by a mu&s;ket or arrow, the poor animal in&s;tantly claps its hand on the wound, looks at the blood, and with the mo&s;t piteous lamentations a&s;cends to the very top of the tree, in which he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his companions; where, hang|ing by the tail, he continues to bewail his fate, till by the lo&s;s of blood he grows totally faint, and drops down dead at the feet of his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o extraordinary that one of this &s;pecies, when wounded, &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his companions in climb|ing; but that they &s;hould have &s;o much knowledge in botany, as to procure vulnerary herbs, and chew and apply them to the wound, is what I cannot credit, though it is &s;o confidently a&s;&s;erted by a late traveller: and as to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they give in pa&s;&s;ing a river, by holding each other's tails, and &s;winging till the lowermo&s;t is thrown up to the branch of a high tree, though I have a great opinion of Ullod, who relates it, and has given a print of
<PB N="12" REF="19">

<P>I mu&s;t here mention another monkey that I &s;aw at Co|lonel Fourgeoud's hou&s;e, which is in Surinam called the <HI>wanacoe,</HI> and is covered over with long black hair, like the quato; but its limbs are &s;horter and more hairy, and its face is a kind of dirty white. This monkey is the only one of the &s;pecies that is not &s;ociable, being con|&s;tantly found alone; and &s;o de&s;picable is this &s;olitary animal, that he is continually beaten and robbed of his food by all the others, from whom he is too lazy to e&s;cape, though too cowardly to fight.</P>
<P>Of the long-haired monkies, the <HI>&s;accawinkee</HI> is the &s;malle&s;t; indeed, I may &s;ay of all the monkies in

Guiana, if not in the world, being not much larger than a Norway rat.</P>
<P>This is a beautiful little animal, with blacki&s;h grey frizzled hair, a white face, and very bright &s;hining eyes; its ears are large and naked, yet they are not very per|ceptible, being covered by the very long and white whi&s;kers that grow round the whole vi&s;age of this little creature: its feet are not unlike tho&s;e of a &s;quir|rel, and its tail is bu&s;hy and annulated. So very delicate is the &s;accawinkee, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the cold, that &s;carcely one of them is brought to Europe alive, and if they are they very &s;oon pine and die. The Dutch call them the <HI>&s;hagarintee,</HI> from their being chagrined at the &s;malle&s;t trifle. In the annexed plate, I have delineated both tho&s;e monkies, the large quato, and the &s;mall &s;accawinkee, thus endeavouring to correct with my pencil the deficiency of my pen.</P>
<P>On my return to the Magdenberg, I narrowly e&s;caped being cru&s;hed to death by an enormous tree, which dropped by age ju&s;t at my feet. The&s;e accidents fre|quently happen in the fore&s;t; this, however, only &s;lightly wounded two or three of our marines. During this trip we had much rain, and were obliged to cro&s;s over a &s;mall creek. We cut down one of the palm-trees on the water's edge, which falling acro&s;s the river formed a temporary bridge.</P>
<P>I now paid a vi&s;it to the mi&s;erable negro who had been found with his throat cut, and who was &s;o well as to
<PB N="14" REF="21">
be able to conver&s;e; when he declared to me, that he committed this violent action with his own hand. The &s;u&s;pected officer and &s;entinel were, therefore, in&s;tantly acquitted. I a&s;ked him by what rea&s;on he had been incited to &s;uicide? and he an&s;wered&mdash;"None."</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have," &s;aid he,
"as good a ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s as I could wi&s;h, and a family of my own that I much love: I had &s;lept &s;ound during the whole night till about four o'clock in the morning, when awaking I took my knife to pick my teeth with it, and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly cut my throat without knowing why; but the moment after repented of what I had done. I then ro&s;e from my hammock and got into the canoe to wa&s;h my&s;elf, and try to bind up the wound, but &s;tooping over the &s;ide and bleeding very fa&s;t, I turned faint and fell into the river. I was now no more able to get on board, or to cry for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. However, by &s;truggling, I made &s;hift to get on &s;hore, where I fell down and lay helple&s;s, till I was picked up by a boat going to Magdenberg; during all which time of nine days I had my perfect &s;en&s;es, and &s;aw a tamanoir or ant-bear come to &s;mell the pu|trid blood about my neck, who, on &s;eeing me move, retired into the fore&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I gave the poor man &s;ome Bo&s;ton bi&s;cuits which I had got from Paramaribo, a large caliba&s;h with barley to make him &s;ome &s;oup, and al&s;o &s;ome wine. This negro appeared to be about &s;ixty years of age.</P>
<P>I now to my &s;orrow received a letter from Mr. Ken|nedy,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
who was preparing to vi&s;it Holland, reque&s;ting that my boy Quaco might be returned to his e&s;tate. I ac|cordingly &s;ent him down with a letter, offering to buy him of his ma&s;ter as &s;oon as it &s;hould be in my power to pay him.</P>
<P>On the 2d of April, Colonel Fourgeoud ordered all the &s;ick remaining in the colony to Magdenberg, where he had erected an ho&s;pital and a large victualling magazine. Thus all the invalids from Clarenbeck arrived here, with &s;urgeons, apothecaries, attendants, &amp;c.: and here, in fact, as I &s;aid, the air was more healthy. At this period the old gentleman was particularly ill-natured, and abu&s;ed both friend and foe without di&s;tinction; &s;wearing, that not a &s;oul &s;hould be exempt from duty, provided they could but &s;tand on their legs. About this time a &s;trong detachment was &s;ent to the e&s;tate Bruyin&s;burgh in Co|mewina, where an in&s;urrection was expected, the &s;laves refu&s;ing to work upon a Sunday; to which, however, they were driven by the la&s;h of the whip.</P>
<P>It was now in the mid&s;t of the rainy &s;ea&s;on, that Fourgeoud declared his intention of &s;couring the woods; and, in con&s;equence, gave orders for two &s;trong columns to march the next day. The rea&s;on for chu&s;ing this &s;ea&s;on was, that if he could now di&s;lodge the rebels they mu&s;t &s;tarve for want, which would not be the ca&s;e in the dry months, for then the fore&s;t abounds with fruits and roots of many kinds. This was, however, in my opinion, a fal&s;e piece of general&s;hip; if it be con&s;idered on the
<PB N="16" REF="23">
other hand, the dreadful havock which the wet weather mu&s;t produce among his troops, of which he killed, I &s;uppo&s;e, at the rate of twenty to one rebel negro.</P>
<P>Fourgeoud was him&s;elf of a very &s;trong con&s;titution, having been u&s;ed to hunting and &s;hooting the whole of his life-time: to which he added temperance, and the daily u&s;e of his beloved <HI>ti&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of nothing but a wai&s;tcoat, through one of the button-holes of which he wore his &s;word: on his head he wore a cotton night-cap, with a white beaver hat above it, and in his hand a cane; but he &s;eldom car|ried his mu&s;ket or his pi&s;tols. I have &s;een him all in rags and bare-footed, like the meane&s;t &s;oldier.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 3d of April, at &s;ix o'clock, the two columns &s;et out upon their march, the one com|manded by Colonel Seyburg, the other by Four|geoud; to which la&s;t I had the honour to belong. Our poor men were now loaded like a&s;&s;es. They were ordered to put their fire-locks in their knap&s;acks, of cour&s;e the muzzles excepted: this was to keep them from the rain, which ab&s;olutely poured in torrents. Our cour&s;e was &s;outh by ea&s;t, up among the banks of the Tempatee Creek, where we &s;oon came to &s;wamps, and were marching in the water above our knees.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t day's march we met &s;ome very pretty &s;quirrels, which are of &s;everal kinds in this country. Tho&s;e that we &s;aw were brown, with the belly white, the tail not &s;o bu&s;hy; nor were they, upon the whole, &s;o large
<PB N="17" REF="24">
as tho&s;e of Europe. There are al&s;o white &s;quirrels in this country with red eyes, and flying &s;quirrels. The&s;e, it is well known, have no wings, but a membrane between the fore and hinder leg, being a part of their &s;kin, which, when they leap, expands like the wing of a bat, and by this, like a parachute, they re&s;t upon the air, and in their flights are carried to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 4th of April we marched again, our cour&s;e &s;outh by ea&s;t, till two o'clock, when we changed our cour&s;e to &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>This day we pa&s;&s;ed by piles of fine timber, that were left there to rot &s;ince 1757, when the e&s;tates were demo|li&s;hed by the negro &s;laves who were in rebellion. Among the&s;e were the <HI>purple-heart-tree,</HI> the <HI>iron-wood-tree,</HI> and the <HI>bourracourra,</HI> known in England by the name of Brazil.</P>
<P>The purple-heart-tree grows &s;ometimes to the height of four&s;core feet, and thick in proportion, with a &s;mooth dark brown bark; the wood is of a beautiful purple co|lour and an agreeable &s;mell, and is much e&s;teemed on account of its weight and durability.</P>
<P>The iron-wood-tree, &s;o called from the gravity and permanent quality of its timber, grows to about &s;ixty feet in height, with a light-coloured bark. It is much valued by the natives as well as the Europeans, on ac|count of its hardne&s;s in particular (re&s;i&s;ting even the hatchet), and for taking a mo&s;t beautiful bright poli&s;h. This wood &s;inks in water.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">The bourracourra, or brazil, grows to between thirty and forty feet high, but not very thick, with a reddi&s;h bark. The heart only of this tree is valuable, after the white pithy part is cut away, though then it is much di|mini&s;hed. This wood is as truly beautiful as it is u&s;e|ful, the colour being a fine crim&s;on, variegated with irregular and fanta&s;tical black &s;pots, from which, by the French, it is called <HI>bois de lettres.</HI> It is heavy, hard, and durable, though rather brittle, and is capable of taking the brighte&s;t poli&s;h; this la&s;t is &s;carce in Guiana, but the others are more plentiful, growing on the highe&s;t grounds; where al&s;o is found ebony. The heavy trees, being &s;haped into timbers for &s;ugar-mills, are chiefly &s;ent to the Engli&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands, and often &s;old for the price of fifty guineas each piece.</P>
<P>The word of command being again given on the 5th, we un&s;lung our hammocks, then marched &s;outh-&s;outh|ea&s;t, and &s;outh by ea&s;t, through deep and dangerous mar&s;hes up to our brea&s;ts in water, and in very heavy rains; in which helple&s;s &s;ituation we were &s;uddenly alarmed, not by a party of rebels, but by a company of large mon|kies, which we di&s;covered in the tops of the trees, knock|ing a kind of nuts again&s;t the branches to break them for their contents, with the greate&s;t regularity, as it were keeping time alternately at every &s;troke, while &s;ome of them threw down their burthens; and a nut falling from a con&s;iderable height, broke the head of one of our ma|rines. The &s;ound of breaking the&s;e nuts, we had mi&s;|taken for the rebel negroes cutting wood with an axe.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26">In the evening we encamped near the Tempatee Creek; where we made large fires, and built comfort|able huts; thus this night we &s;lept protected from the wet. Here we found the be&s;t water I ever ta&s;ted: and in the camp I &s;aw two remarkable lizards, the one called the <HI>devil of the woods,</HI> and the other <HI>agama,</HI> in this country. The fir&s;t is an ugly &s;mall lizard of a deep brown or blacki&s;h colour, which runs with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s up and down the trees; it has no &s;cales, a large head, and it is &s;aid to bite, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an uncommon pro|perty in a lizard. The other is called the <HI>Mexican came|leon,</HI> which is remarkably &s;plendid; and, like others of the kind, is endued with the property of changing its colour; but of its nature and qualities I can &s;ay little more, having never had the opportunity of a clo&s;e ex|amination. In Surinam there is al&s;o a &s;pecies of lizard, known by the name of <HI>&s;alamander,</HI> which al&s;o I never &s;aw.</P>
<P>On the 6th we marched again, keeping due we&s;t till twelve o'clock, through very heavy rain and deep water; when we changed our cour&s;e to the north, and pa&s;&s;ed over very high mountains, by many &s;uppo&s;ed to be pregnant with trea&s;ure.</P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="27">The two highe&s;t mountains in South America, are that peak of the Andes called <HI>Chimborazo,</HI> which mea&s;ures 20,460 geometrical feet above the &s;urface of the South Sea; having, though under the line, 4000 feet of its &s;ummit continually covered with &s;now. The other is that, on the &s;lope of which is built the city of Quito, at the heighth of 9,370 feet, and is thought to be the highe&s;t inhabited land in South America, if not in the world.</P>
<P>We &s;till continued marching north, on the 7th, over mountains, from which, at intervals, we had undoubt|edly the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pects, as well from the wildne&s;s of the country, as the beautiful variegated verdure di&s;played in &s;o many different &s;hades through this amazing fore&s;t.

But the objects which mo&s;t attracted my attention were the <HI>arnotta-trees,</HI> a few of which we met with: of the&s;e I have copied one of the twigs with great exactne&s;s. This tree, which is al&s;o called the <HI>rowcow,</HI> or the <HI>orlean-tree,</HI> and by the Indians <HI>co&s;&s;owee,</HI> may rather be &s;tiled a &s;hrub, as it does not grow above twelve feet in height.

<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed an arm of the Mapanee Creek in the evening, we once more returned to our camp at Mag|denberg; Mr. Noot, one of our officers, and &s;everal others, were &s;o ill, that they were carried in their ham|mocks upon poles by the negro &s;laves, and a great num|ber were &s;o very weak that they could &s;carcely &s;upport the weight of their emaciated bodies; but to complain of &s;ickne&s;s was to mutiny, till they dropped down almo&s;t ready to expire. During this expedition, in which we &s;till perceived nothing of the enemy, I was remarkably fortunate, having neither &s;uffered by fatigue, nor been per&s;ecuted by extraordinary bad u&s;age. The &s;ucceeding day Colonel Seyburg's column arrived, having, like us, &s;een no appearance of the rebels.</P>
<P>On the 9th, my boy Quaco returned from Paramaribo;
<PB N="22" REF="30">
his ma&s;ter, Mr. Walter Kennedy, having, to my great joy, &s;old him to me for the &s;um of five hundred Dutch florins, amounting with the expences to near fifty pounds, for which Colonel Fourgeoud very civilly gave me a bill on his agent. The payment of this faithful &s;ervant's ran|&s;om, of cour&s;e revived my impatience for the long-wi&s;hed moment of emancipation of my poor Joanna and her boy; from who&s;e new ma&s;ter I had not yet received any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>While we continued here, a negro brought me a beautiful butterfly, which I copied with all the correct|ne&s;s I was ma&s;ter of; and which I &s;aw &s;ince in Ma|dam Merian's collection, where it is coloured very ill. This fly was a dark blue tinged with green, and va|riegated with &s;pots like a peacock's feather, and on each wing it had a &s;pot of pale yellow; the under part of the wings were a charming crim&s;on and purple; the body a pale red.&mdash;The caterpillar is green and yellow; it is crowned with eight horns on the head, and has two on the tail. About the &s;ame time Captain Fredericy re|turned al&s;o from traver&s;ing the woods. He had a cor|poral drowned by &s;lipping off a tree in cro&s;&s;ing over a creek; which accident frequently happened, but the men were generally picked up, except this poor fellow, who &s;unk to the bottom in&s;tantly with all his accou|trements.</P>
<P>Another negro al&s;o brought me a regale of <HI>groe-groe,</HI> or cabbage-tree worms, as they are called in Surinam.

This reptile is produced in a tree called the <HI>mountain-cabbage-tree,</HI> which is one of the palm &s;pecies.

However di&s;gu&s;ting to appearance, the&s;e worms are a delicious treat to many people, and they are regularly &s;old at Paramaribo.

<P>Colonel Fourgeoud now treated me with the greate&s;t politene&s;s.

<P>He now gave me leave, for fourteen days, to go to town to wi&s;h Mr. Kennedy a pro&s;perous voyage to Eu|rope.

of which we will all chearfully &s;hed our blood for the pre&s;ervation and pro&s;perity of our ma&s;ter, our mi&s;tre&s;s, and the colony."</Q></P>
<P>To this humble and pathetic remon&s;trance the an&s;wer was, that they were all liars, and &s;hould, as &s;uch, be flogged round the &s;treets of Paramaribo; and this mo&s;t ini|quitous &s;entence was executed with the greate&s;t &s;everity.</P>
<P>Such is the con&s;equence of the law of the colony, that the te&s;timony of a negro is never to be taken. Had any one white per&s;on been pre&s;ent at the above carnage, the evidence would have been good, but even then this fury would have e&s;caped by paying a fine of fifty pounds for each murder.&mdash;But enough&mdash;my &s;oul &s;inks within me while I dwell &s;o long upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On the 2d of May, being again perfectly recovered, I took leave of Joanna and her Johnny, for thus he was named after my&s;elf, though the ceremony of bapti&s;m could not yet be performed; they now continued at my friend De la Mare's hou&s;e, whil&s;t I &s;et out once more for Magdenberg in a tent-boat with &s;ix oars.</P>
<P>On the 3d, I called at Egmond, on my French friend Mon&s;ieur Cachelieu, and next day &s;topt at Oranjebo or Ornamibo, where I was heartily entertained by my old adver&s;ary Captain Meyland, with whom I had fought at the Wana Creek. But now this gentleman declared, that he loved me better than any man in the colony. He was ju&s;t returned from a twelve days cruize through the woods.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37">Among his men I recollected one Cordus, a gentle|man's &s;on from Hamburgh, in which character I had known him, and who had been trepanned into the We&s;t India Company's &s;ervice by the crimps or &s;ilver|coopers as a common &s;oldier. This corps, as I have al|ready &s;aid, is compo&s;ed of all nations, Chri&s;tians, Gentiles, and even Jews; the latter, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, devoured pork and bacon, without &s;cruple or he&s;itation, as often as they could find it.</P>
<P>On this &s;pot, which had formerly been a plantation, but was now choked with weeds, I met with &s;ome herbs which again I cannot pa&s;s unnoticed, though I have no other names for them than tho&s;e given me by the negroes, one only excepted, which is commonly known by the name of the <HI>&s;iliqua-hir&s;uta,</HI> cow-edge, or cow-itch, and called by the black people <HI>cra&s;&s;y-weeree-weeree.</HI> I can only de&s;cribe this as a kind of pea, or rather flatti&s;h &s;mall purple bean, growing in a pod from a &s;lender creep|ing vine; the&s;e pods are covered with a kind of fine ela&s;tic &s;picula, which, when touched, cau&s;e an intolerable itch|ing. This hairy coat &s;craped from the pod, and taken in a tea-&s;poon with jelly, &amp;c. has been &s;trongly re|commended as a vermifuge. A &s;ort of wood was al&s;o &s;hewn me here by one of the &s;laves, which he called <HI>cra&s;&s;y-wood</HI>; this had the &s;ame itching effect when touch|ed, but with re&s;pect to its general qualities I can &s;ay no|thing further. The other &s;hrubs that we found were what they called <HI>con&s;aca-weeree-weeree</HI>; the&s;e grow
<PB N="29" REF="38">
with large green leaves, which the negroes u&s;e for the cure of a di&s;order in the feet called <HI>con&s;aca,</HI> when they can procure no limes or lemons, as I have already men|tioned: this plant al&s;o makes an excellent &s;allad. The <HI>dea-weeree-weeree</HI> is a fine whole&s;ome herb, and very much e&s;teemed; but the <HI>cutty-weeree-weeree</HI> is among&s;t the mo&s;t &s;erious pe&s;ts in the colony, being a kind of &s;trong edged gra&s;s, which is in &s;ome places very plen|tiful; and when a man walks through it will cut his legs like a razor. Herbs in general are in this country known by the name of <HI>weeree-weeree</HI> by the negroes.</P>
<P>On the 5th, I arrived at Magdenberg. Here Colonel Seyburg, and what he called his officers, &s;eemed to form a di&s;tinct corps from tho&s;e of Fourgeoud. They appeared totally de&s;titute of politene&s;s, and treated each other with the greate&s;t rudene&s;s, while their colonel was mo&s;t cordially hated by the commander in chief. This &s;tate of things contributed to render our &s;ituation &s;till more di&s;agreeable: I however had at this time little rea&s;on to complain, being for the pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, in the good graces of Fourgeoud, which, by a trifling accident, I had nearly again forfeited. Colonel Fourgeoud having purcha&s;ed of &s;ome Indians a couple of mo&s;t beautiful parrots, called here <HI>cocatoos,</HI> which were in a cage ready to be &s;hipped off as a pre&s;ent to her royal highne&s;s the prince&s;s of Orange, I per&s;uaded Mon&s;ieur Laurant, his valet-de-chambre, to take one of them out, that I might the better examine it, but the cage-door was no &s;ooner
<PB N="30" REF="39">
opened, than it gave a &s;hriek, and di&s;appeared in an in|&s;tant, flying over the Tempatee Creek. The poor valet &s;tood perfectly petrified, and could only pronounce "Voyez-vous?" whil&s;t I took to my heels to avoid the approaching &s;torm, but &s;topped near enough to ob&s;erve Fourgeoud's motions through the underwood. He was no &s;ooner informed of the <HI>dreadful</HI> accident, than he began to &s;torm, &s;wear, and dance like a man totally deprived of rea&s;on; he next, by kicking it, killed a poor waddling duck belonging to one of our officers; and at la&s;t actually tram|pled his very wig under his feet, while I &s;tood trembling, and the re&s;t of the &s;pectators were laughing aloud. In about half an hour his pa&s;&s;ion began gradually to cool, and then he had recour&s;e to a &s;tratagem which actually brought the parrot back into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He placed the remaining captive on the top of its cage, tied by a &s;mall cord round its claw; this he &s;et in the open air, putting a ripe banana in&s;ide, and leaving the door open, &s;o that any other bird except the pri&s;oner might come at it; the poor captive at la&s;t becoming very hungry, made &s;uch a noi&s;e and &s;hrieking as to be heard by his mate, who returning entered the cage in que&s;t of food, and was once more deprived of his freedom. I now ventured from my concealment, and was acquitted after a gentle reproof; though poor Laurant, as may well be imagined, did not e&s;cape without a thundering lecture.</P>
<P>The cocatoos are le&s;s than the parrots, and of a green colour, except the head and a few feathers in the tail,
<PB N="31" REF="40">
which are of a pale red. This bird is crowned with a <HI>pa|na&s;he</HI> or bunch of feathers, and which generally lie back|ward, but which it erects at plea&s;ure, when it is irritated or afraid.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;een in Surinam a parrot of a deep &s;late blue colour, though not like tho&s;e that come from the coa&s;t of Guinea, which are rather of a lead-grey. This parrot is &s;aid to be very &s;carce, and only inhabits the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, whence it is brought to Pa|ramaribo by the Indians: this bird is le&s;s than the com|mon parrot, but appears very &s;trong and lively. The mo&s;t common parrots in Guiana are tho&s;e which Marc|grave calls <HI>ajuriicura.</HI> The&s;e birds are not &s;o large as tho&s;e that come from Africa; they are green, with the brea&s;t and belly a pale yellow; on the top of the head they have a blue &s;pot, and the feet are grey, with four toes like the re&s;t of the genus, two before and two be|hind; in the wings they have &s;ome feathers of a bright blue, and &s;ome a deep crim&s;on; they are more a nui&s;ance than a plea&s;ure in Surinam, where, in prodigious flocks, they perch among&s;t the coffee, maize, rice, &amp;c. and commit great deva&s;tations; and what makes them a &s;till greater nui&s;ance, their &s;hrieking noi&s;e is almo&s;t in&s;upportable. They always fly in pairs, and very &s;wift, towards the ea&s;t, as I have ob&s;erved, meeting the &s;un in the morning, and toward the we&s;t they follow it in the evening: they ge|nerally breed in remote places and lay two eggs. I brought down two of the&s;e parrots at a &s;hot when I was
<PB N="32" REF="41">
at Spork&s;gift e&s;tate; the&s;e animals not being quite dead, &s;cratched me mo&s;t terribly with their &s;harp claws, as they are very &s;trong and tenacious of life. We had them dre&s;&s;ed, and they made no bad &s;oup; they may al&s;o do in a pye as rooks in England, but dre&s;&s;ed in any other way they are tough and di&s;agreeable. The&s;e green par|rots may be taught to &s;peak, laugh, cry, bark, whi&s;tle, or mew, but not near &s;o well as tho&s;e which come from Africa. It is &s;aid, they are often intoxicated by the &s;eeds of the cotton plant. The&s;e parrots are al&s;o &s;ubject to fits, perhaps from their choleric di&s;po&s;ition, yet longe|vity is peculiarly a&s;cribed to them by the Indians: they have &s;trong hooked bills, which a&s;&s;i&s;t them in climbing and cracking very hard nuts, and they &s;ometimes bite very &s;everely; they delight in &s;winging and balancing, hanging from the branches of trees, and in their wild as well as dome&s;tic &s;tate u&s;e one of their claws as a hand to take their food.</P>
<P>In Surinam there are al&s;o &s;ome beautiful paroquets, which are a &s;pecies of parrots, but &s;maller though not le&s;s common; the fine&s;t of the&s;e is of the &s;ize of a very &s;mall pigeon; they are of a lively green on the back and tail, but the head and neck are auburn, the feathers on the la&s;t being edged with a gold colour, which gives them the appearance of rich &s;collops or &s;cales: the brea&s;t is of a leaden hue, the belly lilac, the wings tipped with orange and azure, and the bill of a very dark blue; the eyes are the colour of fire, and the feet quite black. The other
<PB REF="42">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>The Anamoe &amp; Green Parrots of Guiana.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="33" REF="43">
&s;pecies are perfectly green, with a white bill, and a crim&s;on &s;pot on the head; the&s;e make an agreeable chattering, but are not &s;o ea&s;ily dome&s;ticated as the former.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ented this evening by a &s;oldier with a bird of a quite different kind, which he had actually caught with his hands. This was no other than the <HI>annamoe,</HI> or Su|rinam partridge, and a finer creature I never &s;aw: it was of the &s;ize of a large duck, extremely fat, and of a dark brown colour on the back and wings, and on the top of the head, the under part of which, the brea&s;t, the belly, and the thighs, were of a fine cream-colour, intermixed with orange feathers and very &s;mall tran&s;ver&s;e black bars. The body was exactly the &s;hape of an egg, it had no tail, the neck was long, the bill &s;hort, but very &s;harp|pointed, and a little curved; the eyes were bright, and as black as jet; the legs &s;hort, of the colour of vermilion, with three &s;mall toes on each foot. This bird, it is &s;aid, runs with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s, hiding it&s;elf among&s;t the gra&s;s and weeds, but flies very heavily on account of its plumpne&s;s, which was the cau&s;e of its being thus over|taken by the marine. We had it roa&s;ted, and indeed no|thing could be more delicious. As I took a correct draw|ing of it, I refer the reader to the annexed plate; where he may al&s;o &s;ee the parrot of South America, as de&s;cribed above, be&s;ides a few curious ne&s;ts, of which I have given an account in Vol. I. p. 375, but where I had no op|portunity of placing them; and which, be&s;ides their cu|rio&s;ity, may &s;erve to &s;hew how much the public are im|po&s;ed
<PB N="34" REF="44">
upon; when, in Gold&s;mith's Animated Nature, Vol. V. p. 253, that author a&s;&s;erts, that they are built on the banana and plantain trees, where he al&s;o de&s;cribes the monkies, and numbers of large &s;erpents as a&s;&s;embling. All this I here think it my duty to pronounce erroneous, as I con&s;ider it would be unpardonable in me to let &s;uch ab&s;urdities pa&s;s by unnoticed.</P>
<P>On the 9th, an accident had nearly befallen me, which mu&s;t have cau&s;ed me much poignant and la&s;ting &s;orrow. My black boy, wa&s;hing my cotton hammock in the Tem|patee Creek, was &s;uddenly carried to the bottom by the rapidity of the &s;tream, and entangled in its la&s;hings, &s;o that both the one and the other di&s;appeared; the boy, however, luckily extricated him&s;elf, though with great difficulty, and to my great joy, though more than half drowned, appeared once more on terra firma; when he had the pre&s;ence of mind in&s;tantly to &s;ink a large fi&s;h-hook, with a lead tied to a &s;trong line, &s;ome yards below the &s;pot, with which he actually brought up the ham|mock, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, the &s;tream running &s;o &s;wift that it rolled over the ground, and was liable to &s;hift its &s;tation every moment.</P>
<P>The following day, as Captain Hamel was angling, his tackle got fa&s;t at the bottom of the creek, when, in div|ing to clear it, I &s;truck my ancle with &s;uch violence again&s;t a rock, that it was &s;everal months before it was perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>The&s;e accidents appeared greatly to entertain Colonel Seyburg, while in return I could not help feeling a de|gree
<PB N="35" REF="45">
of indignation at what I con&s;idered as unhand&s;ome behaviour; but the mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance was, that this di&s;gu&s;t between Seyburg and my&s;elf &s;eemed to gain me the favour of old Fourgeoud, almo&s;t as much as if I had de&s;troyed half the rebel negroes in the colony.&mdash; During all this time &s;trong patroles cruized between Magdenberg, La Rochelle, and the Jew Savannah; and on the 17th, the commander in chief marched to Pata|maca with nearly the half of his troops, leaving <HI>me</HI> the command of tho&s;e that remained on the mountain, for I was not able to accompany him, having by this time a dangerous mortification in my ancle.</P>
<P>As I had now the pro&s;pect of remaining &s;ome time at Magdenberg, I di&s;patched Quaco to Paramaribo for pro|vi&s;ions, and orders to buy me a live goat.</P>
<P>Whatever may be thought of Fourgeoud's manoeuvres, in not being able to bring the rebels to a pitched battle, it is very certain that he exerted him&s;elf and his troops to the utmo&s;t; and that by his con&s;tantly traver&s;ing the upper parts of the rivers, and &s;couring the &s;kirts of the colony, he prevented many depredations on the e&s;tates, which was undoubtedly a very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the inhabitants, though at a dreadful expence of blood and money.</P>
<P>Being now the commander in chief at this po&s;t, the two negroes I have formerly mentioned hunting and fi&s;hing for me, brought me almo&s;t every day one or two <HI>pingos,</HI> which are the wild boars formerly mentioned, be&s;ides a
<PB N="36" REF="46">
fi&s;h called <HI>newmara,</HI> &s;ome of which are as large as cod, and which I &s;hall afterwards de&s;cribe. With the&s;e dain|ties I regaled all the officers without exception, while I gave to the ho&s;pital all the plantains, bananas, oranges, and lemons, that were occa&s;ionally &s;ent me as pre&s;ents from the <HI>Jacob</HI> and the plantations in Upper Comewina; and never was a deputy-governor more univer&s;ally be|loved. Patroles were al&s;o daily &s;ent out to every quarter; and the environs of Magdenberg were &s;o completely &s;coured, that no inva&s;ion from the rebels could be practi|cable. The&s;e precautions were the more nece&s;&s;ary, as they had <HI>formerly</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed and taken by &s;torm different military po&s;ts for the &s;ake of ammunition and fire-arms, which are to them of the utmo&s;t value, and their &s;eizure of the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence to the colony. Indeed &s;ome po&s;ts had not only been attacked and plundered of their &s;tores and ammunition, but were actually ma&s;&s;acred to a man.</P>
<P>Mortified that it was not in my power to take a more active part at pre&s;ent, I availed my&s;elf of this lei&s;ure, by taking drawings of every animal, reptile, or &s;hrub, that I thought could illu&s;trate my little collection of natural cu|rio&s;ities, which I now began to form &s;ome idea of exhi|biting to the public, if it &s;hould be my fate ever more to return to Europe.</P>
<P>One of my negroes, on the 24th of this month, brought me two curious in&s;ects; which, though I had no op|portunity of drawing, I will endeavour to de&s;cribe:&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="47">
The one (which &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;mall affinity to the gra&s;shopper kind) was what is here generally called <HI>&s;paan&s;e-juffer,</HI> and is without exception the mo&s;t &s;ingular animal I &s;aw in the colony. The body of this &s;urpri&s;ing creature, though not thicker than a quill, was no le&s;s than &s;even inches and a half in length, including the tail; it had no wings, and was mounted like a &s;pider on &s;ix legs that were near &s;ix inches long; it had four antennae pro|jecting from its head, two being nearly five inches, and two much &s;horter; the head was &s;mall, the eyes large, black, and prominent, and the tail articulated like that of mo&s;t in&s;ects: its colour was a browni&s;h green, and, upon the whole, it &s;eemed a mon&s;ter. This creature is found near the mar&s;hy places, where its long legs appear de|&s;igned to enable it to wade through the water, but not to &s;wim (according to Mr. Farmine's opinion) for which its feet are not calculated, as they terminate in two &s;mall claws like tho&s;e of &s;ome beetles. The other was a large fly, which Madam Merian, who gives a drawing of it, calls the <HI>vielleur,</HI> but which I have generally heard called the <HI>&s;care-&s;leep</HI> by the Dutch. The&s;e words being extremely applicable, from the noi&s;e it makes towards the evening, which nearly re&s;embles the &s;ound of a cymbal, or that of a razor-grinder when at his work. This remarkable fly, who&s;e grinding noi&s;e always begins at &s;un-&s;et or &s;ix o'clock, is al&s;o called the <HI>porte-lanterne</HI> or <HI>lantern-bearer,</HI> from the light it diffu&s;es after that time, and which is much &s;tronger than that of any of the fire-fly &s;pecies,
<PB N="38" REF="48">
affording &s;ufficient light for almo&s;t any purpo&s;e: the&s;e flies are above three inches long, and very thick, the body green, with four tran&s;parent wings variegated with little marks of all colours, particularly the under wings, on which are two large roundi&s;h &s;pots not unlike tho&s;e on the tail feathers of a peacock. Beneath the head of this in&s;ect is &s;een an inverted &s;traight trump or tube like a needle, with which it is &s;aid to &s;uck its food from the flowers. With the &s;ame in&s;trument it is here &s;uppo&s;ed to produce that di&s;agreeable, loud, and grinding noi&s;e, which I have already noticed. But, for my own part, I &s;hould rather a&s;cribe the noi&s;e to the fluttering of its tran&s;parent wings, as is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ca&s;e with &s;ome flies in England: a large probo&s;cis or &s;nout &s;triped red and yellow, and &s;haped like the fir&s;t joint of a man's finger, projects from the head, and makes one-third of the whole animal; this protuberance is vulgarly called its lantern, and emits that &s;urpri&s;ing light whence it takes its &s;econd name. I &s;hall only add, that it is a very &s;low creeper, but flies with amazing velocity.</P>
<P>On the 26th, my boy Quaco arrived from Paramaribo with the following li&s;t of provi&s;ions, which he had pur|cha&s;ed for me. In order to give the curious a ju&s;t idea of the prices in Surinam when things are cheape&s;t, I will here in&s;ert &s;ome articles as charged to my account, with the prices in Engli&s;h money, calculating at the rate of eleven florins to one pound &s;terling.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="49">The&s;e articles were as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM>2 bacon hams, 31 lbs. at 15 <HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 &s;mall cag of butter, 10lbs. at 1<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 &s;mall ditto of flour, 100lbs. at 4<HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Dutch chee&s;e, 11lbs. at 10<HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 quart bottles of vinegar, at 1<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> per quart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 lbs. &s;permaceti candles, at 3<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 lbs. dried &s;au&s;ages, at 2<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> per lb.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The prices of wine and &s;pirits I have already mentioned in the twelfth chapter.</P>
<P>He al&s;o brought me a goat with its kid to &s;upply me with milk, for which I paid twenty florins, or near two pounds &s;terling: the&s;e prices are at lea&s;t double, and &s;ome treble, to what they u&s;ed to be in England.</P>
<P>Goats are very common in all Guiana; they are not large, but very beautiful creatures, with &s;mall horns, and very &s;hort &s;mooth hair, mo&s;tly of a dun-colour; they are as nimble as &s;tags, and are kept on all the e&s;tates, where they breed fa&s;t and give much milk; they are al&s;o deli|cious eating when killed young.</P>
<P>I had now the di&s;agreeable news, that all my letters for Europe were &s;unk on board Captain Vi&s;&s;er, who was wrecked in the Texel roads among the ice. I was al&s;o &s;incerely grieved to hear that my good friend Mr. Kennedy, with his lady and family, had taken their final farewel of the colony, and &s;ailed for Holland. This gentleman, Mr. Gordon, and a Mr. Gourluy, were the only Scotch; a Mr. Buckland, a Mr. Town&s;end, and Mr.
<PB N="40" REF="50">
Halfhide, the only Engli&s;h; and Captain Macneal, the only native of Ireland, re&s;iding in this colony.</P>
<P>On the 28th, Colonel Fourgeoud returned with his command from Patamaca, much emaciated him&s;elf, and his men nearly exhau&s;ted by fatigue. He had left a great number behind him in the ho&s;pital at La Rochelle, but heard no account whatever of the rebels, although he varied his route every time. It was therefore pretty evident that they were routed, if latterly there had been any &s;ettled at all: but where to find them in this un|bounded fore&s;t was the que&s;tion. He however never de|&s;paired, and &s;eemed as eager to di&s;cover the haunts of the rebels as he had been formerly in &s;pringing a covey of partridges, or di&s;covering a ne&s;t of black badgers.</P>
<P>On the 29th, Mr. Matthew, one of our officers who had been out &s;hooting, pre&s;ented me with the <HI>Taibo,</HI> an animal that is here called the wood-rat. This creature was the &s;ize of a young hare, and of a reddi&s;h brown co|lour, being remarkably thin, with long limbs, a roundi&s;h head, and a tail not unlike that of a &s;ucking-pig; the claws were exactly like tho&s;e of a common rat, but larger in proportion, and &s;o was the head, mouth, teeth, and whi&s;kers; the ears were &s;hort and naked, the eyes black and prominent, with a white iris; it is &s;aid to run very fa&s;t: we had it dre&s;&s;ed, and ate it, having been told that it was very good, and &s;o we found it, &s;weet, tender, and even fat, notwith&s;tanding its lank appearance. This
<PB N="41" REF="51">
creature, on account of its &s;ize, reminds me of another animal, known in this country by the name of <HI>crabbo-dago,</HI> or the crabbed dog, for its matchle&s;s ferocity, as it kills and devours every thing that comes in its way, without exception, whether quadrupeds, fowls, or rep|tiles; and never &s;eeming to be glutted with blood, it mur|ders, even without being hungry, all it can vanqui&s;h, which, on account of its courage, activity, and &s;trength, are not a few, though it be not larger than a common cat. From what I have &s;aid, I &s;hould apprehend it much re&s;embles the <HI>ichneumon,</HI> but &s;till more that ani|mal mentioned by Mr. Allemand, in the Count de Buffon; (&s;ee Vol. IV. p. 266.) which he there calls the <HI>gri&s;on</HI> or grey-weazel, though this that I mention was rather larger; and he &s;ays, that notwith&s;tanding its being a na|tive of Surinam, none of the people coming from that country could give any account of it. If this be the &s;ame animal, (as I doubt not, and have therefore given it the name of the <HI>crabbo-dago</HI> or gri&s;on) I am happy to have had it in my power to give the reader &s;ome ac|count of it. I &s;hall now literally quote the Count's own words, as extracted from Mr. Allemand, which will afford the be&s;t proof of its being the &s;ame animal, when com|pared with the annexed plate, where both the wood-rat, and the <HI>crabbo-dago</HI> or gri&s;on, are repre&s;ented; and had I &s;een this account during the Count's life, I would have mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly taken the liberty of informing him by a
<PB N="42" REF="52">
letter, of what I now, though in this unconnected method, relate to the public.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I received," &s;ays Mr. Allemand,
"the &s;mall animal repre&s;ented in the plate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutch edition, Vol. XV.</NOTE>. In the catalogue it was called the grey-weazel, from which circum&s;tance I de|rived the name gri&s;on, becau&s;e I knew not how it is denominated in the country where it is found. The whole upper part of its body is covered with deep brown hair, having white points, which gives it a greyi&s;h brown colour: under the head and neck is a bright grey, becau&s;e the hairs are very &s;hort, and the white part is of equal length with the brown. The muzzle, the under part of the body, and legs, are black, which &s;ingularly contra&s;ts with the grey colour on the head and neck.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The head of this animal is very large in proportion to its body, its ears almo&s;t form a &s;emicircle, its eyes are large, and its mouth is armed with &s;trong grinders and &s;harp tu&s;ks: it has &s;ix cutting teeth in each jaw, four of them hardly ri&s;ing above the gums. Both the fore and hind feet have five toes, with yellowi&s;h claws; the tail is pretty long, and terminates in a point.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The gri&s;on has a greater re&s;emblance to the weazel, than to any other animal, but it belongs not to the weazel tribe; for its body is not long enough, and its

legs are too long. It is not mentioned by any author or traveller. I &s;hewed it to &s;everal per&s;ons who had lived long in Surinam, but none of them knew it; hence it either mu&s;t be a rare animal, even in its native country, or it mu&s;t live in de&s;erts and unfre|quented places: the length of its body is about &s;even inches; I have not been able to learn any thing of its hi&s;tory."</Q></P>
<P>To this I &s;hall only add my &s;urprize.&mdash; It is true that this animal is very rare in Surinam, but it probably owes its not being de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts to its extreme fero|city, which is without example, it being a very uncom|mon circum&s;tance to take a <HI>crabbo-dago</HI> or gri&s;on alive.</P>
<P>Our old commander and I were now in&s;eparable friends, to who&s;e board being daily invited, he reque&s;ted me to paint his portrait at full length in his bu&s;h equipage, which was to be engraved at the expence of the town of Am&s;terdam, and where he thought him&s;elf now as great a man as the Duke of Cumberland was in England after the battle of Culloden.</P>
<P>Having provided a large &s;heet of paper, and &s;ome China ink, I began to delineate this wonderful cha|racter in his own hut. While I was now looking full in his face, to examine the features of this fir&s;t of de&s;|pots, and laughing aloud, to think how he and I now &s;at &s;taring at one another, the whole mountain was &s;ud|denly &s;hook by a tremendous clap of thunder, while the lightning actually &s;corched the Colonel's forehead; and,
<PB N="44" REF="55">
what is very curious, broke all the eggs under a hen that was &s;itting in a corner of the room where we were engaged. The hero's features being re-compo&s;ed, I proceeded, and the picture was completed in a &s;hort time after, to his great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>About this time the captive rebel, September, who was taken in the year 1773, died of a drop&s;y. Ever &s;ince his capture, when his companion was &s;hot, this poor fellow was obliged to follow Fourgeoud like a dog through all his expeditions; the colonel always expecting that this negro would, one day or other, conduct him to different haunts of the rebels&mdash;but he was mi&s;taken. The other negro &s;laves, &s;u&s;pecting that he had actually given &s;ome information, attributed his dreadful death to a puni&s;h|ment from God, for his want of fidelity to his country|men, to whom they &s;uppo&s;ed he had &s;worn to be true.</P>
<P>The reader may remember, that I have &s;tated it in the third Chapter, as an invariable article of belief among the African negroes, that whoever breaks his oath &s;hall die mi&s;erably in this world, and be puni&s;hed for ever in that which is to come.</P>
<P>By the 2d of June, the Hope in Comewina was become &s;o very unwhole&s;ome for want of cleanline&s;s, and being kept free from inundations (as it was much neglected by the newly-arrived troops which were now &s;tationed there), that the commanding officer and mo&s;t of his men were rendered unfit for duty by &s;ickne&s;s, and many of them already buried. To this place Colonel Fourgeoud or|dered
<PB N="45" REF="56">
down Captain Brant to take the command, with a fre&s;h &s;upply of men, and orders to &s;end, not to town but to Magdenberg, all the invalids he &s;hould relieve. The&s;e orders he gave to the above officer in &s;uch a brutal man|ner, and di&s;patched him &s;o &s;uddenly, that he had not even time to pack up his cloaths; while Colonel Seyburg de|prived him of his only &s;ervant, whom he took for him|&s;elf. This u&s;age &s;o much affected Captain Brant, that he bur&s;t into tears, and declared he did not wi&s;h longer to &s;urvive &s;uch galling treatment: he then departed to the Hope, truly with a broken heart.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival he was informed that Captain Brough, the late commanding officer, was dead. This poor man had been on hard &s;ervice in the woods, and being very corpulent, could no longer &s;upport the fatigues and ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat; he melted down very fa&s;t, and a putrid fever at la&s;t occa&s;ioned his di&s;&s;olution. Captain Brant was &s;oon followed by Colonel Seyburg to the Hope, with orders to in&s;pect the &s;ick.&mdash;In this interval of inaction, I &s;hall de|&s;cribe two fi&s;hes, which, though very different in &s;ize and colour, equally merit particular attention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and indeed the only one of the kind I ever &s;aw, was caught by an angler. It was about the &s;ize of a large anchovy, and, the dorado excepted, was certainly the mo&s;t beautiful coloured fi&s;h I ever &s;aw. Its back and &s;ides were divided in longitudinal bars of fine yellow and a deep bluei&s;h black, the belly was &s;ilver, the eyes were black and gold, and the fins a glowing tran&s;parent vermi|lion;
<PB N="46" REF="57">
its &s;hape was not unlike that of a trout, and the whole was covered with &s;mall &s;cales; it had one dor&s;al fin on the middle of its back, with only the ve&s;tige of another near the tail, which was forked: under its belly were five fins, two pectoral, two ventral, and one behind the anus; the under jaw projected before the upper jaw, and made its mouth appear rever&s;ed; the gills were &s;mall. Having enquired concerning this little fi&s;h, the only in|formation I could obtain was from a black man, who called it <HI>dago-fi&s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>The other is that fine large fi&s;h called by the Engli&s;h <HI>rock-cod,</HI> by the Indians <HI>baro-ketta,</HI> and <HI>new-mara</HI> by the negroes, which I have &s;everal times mentioned, but not de&s;cribed; they are taken plentifully in all the upper parts of the rivers. This fi&s;h is the &s;ize of a large cod, but covered with &s;cales, and by &s;ome compared to a &s;almon; the back is a brown olive colour, the belly is white, the head is &s;trong, with &s;mall eyes, of which the pupil is black and the iris grey; the mouth is very large, and be&s;et with one row of &s;harp teeth like tho&s;e of a pike, and, like it, this creature is extremely voracious; the tail is obtu&s;e and dark olive; as al&s;o the fins, &s;ix in number, one dor&s;al, two pectoral, two ventral, and one abdominal. This fi&s;h is extremely delicious eating, and particularly e&s;teemed by the white inhabitants at Para|maribo, where it is very &s;carce, though in the upper parts of the rivers they are taken in great abundance. I painted the&s;e two fi&s;hes very correctly, the <HI>dago-fi&s;h</HI> as

large as life, and the <HI>new-mara</HI> con&s;iderably le&s;s. The drawings were honoured in Surinam with the epithets of ma&s;terly performances.</P>
<P>Several officers who kept poultry and hogs at this pe|riod lo&s;t all the latter in the &s;pace of two days, being poi|&s;oned probably by eating duncane, or &s;ome other fatal weed that was unknown to us. And yet it has been a general ob&s;ervation, as I have &s;aid before, that all ani|mals know by in&s;tinct to di&s;tingui&s;h their food from their poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Seyburg now returned from the Hope in triumph, with Lieutenant <HI>Dederlin</HI> (one of Colonel Fourgeoud's officers) guarded by a &s;erjeant and &s;ix marines with fixed bayonets, for having been wanting in re&s;pect, as that gentleman plea&s;ed to call it.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the &s;ick officers and &s;oldiers al&s;o arrived from the Hope in barges; &s;ome of the latter, being too ill to bear removing, died on the pa&s;&s;age without medi|cines, and without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. One of our &s;urgeons died al&s;o this day in camp, and a number of the privates died daily. This was the con&s;equence of having marched &s;o much in the wet &s;ea&s;on, which was judged however by our chief to be the only &s;ea&s;on in which he was likely to root the rebels from the fore&s;t of Guiana.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVIII.</NOTE>I HAVE ju&s;t mentioned that &s;everal officers kept poultry, numbers of which were now taken away every night by &s;ome unknown marauder; when a Captain Bolts (&s;u&s;|pecting the <HI>coati-mondi,</HI> or <HI>crabbo-dago)</HI> made a trap of an empty wine-che&s;t, only by &s;upporting the lid with a &s;tick fixed to a long cord, into which (having fir&s;t &s;ecured all the other poultry) he put a couple of live fowls, the whole guarded by two negroes at &s;ome di&s;tance. They had not been many hours on their po&s;t, when hearing the fowls &s;hriek, one negro pulled the rope, and the other ran to &s;ecure the invader by &s;itting on the lid: when this proved to be actually a young tyger, who would yet have cleared his way by beating again&s;t the box, but that it was immediately &s;ecured by &s;trong ropes, and drawn along, with the pri&s;oner in it, to the river; where, being held under water, he was drowned, under the mo&s;t vigo|rous efforts, by beating again&s;t the che&s;t to effect his e&s;|cape. Captain Bolts ordered the &s;kin to be taken off, which he kept in remembrance of &s;o very &s;trange a cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Count de Buffon a&s;&s;erts, that there are no tygers
<PB N="49" REF="61">
in America, but animals much re&s;embling them, which go by that name. I &s;hall however de&s;cribe them, from actual ob&s;ervation, as I found them, and leave the reader to determine whether they are tygers or not.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and large&s;t is that called the <HI>jaguar</HI> of Guiana. This animal, which has by &s;ome been repre&s;ented as a de|&s;pi&s;eable little creature, not larger than a greyhound, is, on the contrary, very fierce, &s;trong, and dangerous; &s;ome of them mea&s;uring, from the no&s;e to the root of the tail, not le&s;s than &s;ix feet: and let us not forget the print of that enormous tyger's foot, &s;een by my&s;elf in the &s;and, near Patamaca; though it may be allowed, that creature was of an extraordinary &s;ize, and the &s;and very loo&s;e.&mdash;The <HI>jaguar</HI> is of a tawny orange colour, and the belly white; on the back it is &s;potted with longitudinal black bars; on the &s;ides with irregular rings, light-coloured in the center; and all over the re&s;t of the body, and the tail, the &s;pots are &s;maller, and perfectly black: its &s;hape is in every &s;en&s;e like that of the African tyger, and being all of the cat kind, they need no particular de&s;cription; but their &s;ize and &s;trength being &s;o much greater than that little dome&s;tic animal, they devour a &s;heep, or a goat, with the &s;ame facility as a cat would kill a mou&s;e or a rat; nay, cows and hor&s;es are not protected from their at|tacks, for the&s;e they frequently kill on the plantations; and though they cannot carry them off into the fore&s;t on account of their weight, they tear and mangle them in a dreadful manner, only for the &s;ake of the blood, with
<PB N="50" REF="62">
which this ferocious animal is never glutted. It has even happened that the <HI>jaguar</HI> has carried off young negro women at work in the field, and too frequently their children. This contemptible animal, as it is called and mi&s;repre&s;ented by &s;ome authors, will beat down a wild boar with a &s;ingle &s;troke of its paw, and even &s;eize by the throat the &s;tronge&s;t &s;tallion that ever was mounted in Guiana; while its &s;avage nature, and thir&s;t after blood, is &s;uch that it cannot be tamed: it will, on the con|trary, bite the very hand that feeds it, and very often devours its own offspring; &s;till this creature is not a match for the <HI>aboma-&s;nake,</HI> which, when it comes within its reach, has the power of cru&s;hing it to a jelly in but few moments.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>couguar,</HI> called in Surinam the <HI>red tyger.</HI>&mdash;This indeed may, with more propriety, be com|pared to a greyhound, for its &s;hape, though not for its &s;ize; being much larger than the dog which it re&s;embles in make, but it is not in general &s;o large and heavy as the <HI>jaguar.</HI> The colour of this animal is a reddi&s;h brown; the brea&s;t and belly are a dirty white, with long hair, and not &s;potted; the tail an earthy colour, the extremity black; the head is &s;mall, the body thin, the limbs long, with tremendous whiti&s;h claws; the teeth are al&s;o very large, the eyes prominent, and &s;parkling like &s;tars. This creature is equally ferocious with the former.</P>
<P>Another of the &s;ame &s;pecies is the <HI>tyger-cat,</HI> which is extremely beautiful. This animal is not much larger
<PB REF="63">

<P><HI>The Tiger-Cat of Surinam.</HI></P>

than I have &s;een &s;ome cats in England: it is of a yellow colour, with &s;mall annulated black &s;pots, which are white within; the belly is a light colour; the ears are black, with a white &s;pot on each; the hair is &s;mooth, and the &s;kin is very much e&s;teemed: the &s;hape like that of the <HI>tyger.</HI> The <HI>tyger-cat</HI> is a very lively animal, with its eyes emitting fla&s;hes like lightning; but ferocious, mi&s;|chievous, and untameable, like the re&s;t of the kind.</P>
<P>In Guiana is &s;till another of this &s;pecies, called the <HI>ja|guanetta,</HI> of a blacki&s;h colour, with &s;till blacker &s;pots; but of this la&s;t I can &s;ay very little, having never &s;een one; and, indeed, the others but very &s;eldom. Of the <HI>jaguar</HI> however, and the <HI>tyger-cat,</HI> I pre&s;ent the reader with a drawing. All the&s;e animals have long whi&s;kers, like common cats; they &s;ometimes climb trees, but ge|nerally lie in ambu&s;h under the verdure, whence they bound with uncommon agility on their helple&s;s prey; which having murdered, they drink the blood warm, and never cea&s;e to tear and devour it till they are gorged; but when no longer animated by hunger they are coward|ly, and may be put to flight by a common &s;paniel. Of &s;ire al&s;o they are exceedingly afraid, which is the be&s;t guard to keep them at a di&s;tance, and as &s;uch, made u&s;e of every night by the Indians in Guiana. More than once it has been ob&s;erved, that tygers had entered our camps for want of the&s;e precautions, but fortunately without committing any depredations.</P>
<P>As I now &s;eemed to be on a friendly intercour&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="65">
with Colonel Fourgeoud, I one day pre&s;ented the old gentleman with a plan and bird's-eye view of all the encampment of Magdenberg, which plea&s;ed him &s;o much that he &s;ent this (as he had done the fir&s;t) to the Prince of Orange and the Duke of Brun&s;wick, as a &s;pecimen of his military manoeuvres, &amp;c. This pre&s;ent had the de&s;ired effect; for I not only became one of his favourites, but, declaring his highe&s;t e&s;teem for the Scots and Engli&s;h, he even promi&s;ed to recommend me in particular at court. I was &s;o &s;atisfied with this change in his beha|viour, that I now took the blame of all former animo&s;ity on my&s;elf. His attention, however, was &s;uddenly at|tracted by affairs of more con&s;equence; &s;ince, on the 14th of June, the news arrived that &s;ome rebel huts were di&s;covered near the &s;ea-&s;ide; that Captain May|land had marched in que&s;t of the enemy, with one hundred and forty men of the Society troops, and had actually di&s;covered them; but in wading through a deep mar&s;h, had been fir&s;t attacked by the negroes, who had killed &s;everal of his people (among whom his nephew, a young volunteer), wounded more, and beaten back the whole detachment, after they had already pa&s;&s;ed the mar&s;h, and were mounting fa&s;t on the oppo&s;ite beach to &s;torm the village. From this news it was evident, that our &s;able foes were not to be trifled with; and &s;ince they were thus di&s;covered, orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for all the troops that were able to march to keep in readine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> Four|geoud's
<PB N="53" REF="66">
marines, the Society regiment, and my favourite rangers, who wanted no &s;pur, and now could hardly be re&s;trained till the others were prepared. The&s;e troops were to be a&s;&s;embled at a certain place of rendezvous, while al&s;o a detachment marched to La Rochelle to give information. In con&s;equence of the&s;e orders all was ac|tivity and vigour in the camp, in hopes that this deci&s;ive &s;troke would end the war, and their mi&s;ery together; and this, therefore, was the time to lead them on to a &s;pirited attack; but, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, our com|mander delayed his movement till the 20th of Augu&s;t, which was above two months.</P>
<P>In the mean time the di&s;agreeable news arrived, that Captain Brant was almo&s;t dead with a violent illne&s;s at the Hope, which was at pre&s;ent the place where a number of the troops were quartered, though no better than a pe&s;t-hou&s;e, by the inundations; and for the command at this place (as being one of his favourites) Fourgeoud now &s;ingled me out: declaring, that I might thank my &s;ound con&s;titution for be&s;towing on me this honour. From this conduct, I plainly di&s;covered that all his friend&s;hip was entirely intere&s;ted; and I felt my re&s;entment involuntarily rekindled again&s;t him, for thus &s;ending me to an in|glorious death, when he had &s;o fair an opportunity of employing me honourably on actual &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On my arrival at the Hope, my orders were to &s;end poor Captain Brant not down to Paramaribo, but to Mag|denberg. This young man, however, fru&s;trated the ty|rannical
<PB N="54" REF="67">
command; for, ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pecting it, he had &s;et out with a tent-barge to town a few hours before I came, where he was no &s;ooner carried to his lodgings than he expired, from the effects of a burning fever, and a broken heart. No man could be more regretted than Captain Brant; nor did Fourgeoud ever lo&s;e a better officer, or I a &s;incerer friend.</P>
<P>This being the &s;econd commander dead in &s;o &s;hort a time, I quietly took for my motto &mdash;
<Q>Hodie tibi cras mihi.</Q>
But I was happily mi&s;taken, and continued &s;till as well as ever I was in my life, following the advice of old Caramaca, and bathing twice a day in the river; while I de&s;pi&s;ed &s;hoes and &s;tockings, as u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary lumber.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, a few days after my arrival, I had the honour to receive a vi&s;it from the governor, Mr. Nep|veu, on his return from his e&s;tate Appecappe to Parama|ribo, with whom I condoled on the lo&s;s of his lady, who had died very lately; I al&s;o received daily vi&s;its from &s;e|veral planters, who complimented me with refre&s;hments from their plantations: and here I had an excellent op|portunity of acquainting my&s;elf with the cu&s;toms and manner of living of the&s;e We&s;t-India nabobs.</P>
<P>A planter in Surinam, when he lives on his e&s;tate, (which is but &s;eldom, as they mo&s;tly prefer the &s;ociety of Paramaribo) gets out of his hammock with the
<PB N="55" REF="68">
ri&s;ing &s;un, <HI>viz.</HI> about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, when he makes his appearance under the piazza of his hou&s;e; where his coffee is ready waiting for him, which he generally takes with his pipe, in&s;tead of toa&s;t and but|ter; and there he is attended by half a dozen of the &s;ine&s;t young &s;laves, both male and female, of the plan|tation, to &s;erve him; at this <HI>&s;anctum-&s;anctorum</HI> he is next acco&s;ted by his over&s;eer, who regularly every morning attends at his levee, and having made his bows at &s;everal yards di&s;tance, with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect informs his Greatne&s;s what work was done the day before; what negroes de&s;erted, died, fell &s;ick, re|covered, were bought or born; and, above all things, which of them neglected their work, affected &s;ickne&s;s, or had been drunk or ab&s;ent, &amp;c.; the pri&s;oners are generally pre&s;ent, being &s;ecured by the negro-drivers, and in&s;tantly tied up to the beams of the piazza, or a tree, without &s;o much as being heard in their own defence; when the flogging begins, with men, women, or children, without exception. The in&s;truments of torture on the&s;e occa&s;ions are long hempen whips, that cut round at every la&s;h, and crack like pi&s;tol-&s;hot; during which they alternately repeat, "<HI>Dankee, ma&s;&s;era,</HI>" (Thank you, ma&s;ter). In the mean time he &s;talks up and down with his over&s;eer, affecting not &s;o much as to hear their cries, till they are &s;ufficiently mangled, when they are untied, and ordered to return to their work, without &s;o much as a dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>This ceremony being over, the dre&s;&s;y negro (a black
<PB N="56" REF="69">
&s;urgeon) comes to make his report; who being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a hearty cur&s;e, for <HI>allowing</HI> any &s;laves to be &s;ick, next makes her appearance a &s;uperannuated matron, with all the young negro children of the e&s;tate, over whom &s;he is governe&s;s; the&s;e, being clean wa&s;hed in the river, clap their hands, and cheer in chorus, when they are &s;ent away to breakfa&s;t on a large platter of rice and plantains; and the levee ends with a low bow from the over&s;eer, as it begun.</P>
<P>His wor&s;hip now &s;aunters out in his morning dre&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts of a pair of the fine&s;t Holland trow&s;ers, white &s;ilk &s;tockings, and red or yellow Morocco &s;lippers; the neck of his &s;hirt open, and nothing over it, a loo&s;e flowing night-gown of the fine&s;t India chintz excepted. On his head is a cotton night-cap, as thin as a cobweb, and over that an enormous beaver hat, that protects his meagre vi&s;age from the &s;un, which is already the colour of mahogany, while his whole carca&s;e &s;eldom weighs above eight or ten &s;tone, being generally exhau&s;ted by the climate and di&s;&s;ipation. To give a more complete idea of this fine gentleman, I in the annexed plate pre&s;ent him to the reader with a pipe in his mouth, which almo&s;t every where accompanies him, and re|ceiving a gla&s;s of Madeira wine and water, from a female quaderoon &s;lave, to refre&s;h him during his walk.</P>

fir&s;t take place, having only exchanged his trow&s;ers for a pair of thin linen or &s;ilk breeches, he &s;its down, and hold|ing out one foot after the other, like a hor&s;e going to be &s;hod, a negro boy puts on his &s;tockings and &s;hoes, which he al&s;o buckles, while another dre&s;&s;es his hair, his wig, or &s;haves his chin, and a third is fanning him to keep off the mu&s;quitoes. Having now &s;hifted, he puts on a thin coat and wai&s;tcoat, all white; when, under an umbrella, carried by a black boy, he is conducted to his barge, which is in waiting for him with &s;ix or eight oars, well provided with fruit, wine, water, and tobacco, by his over&s;eer, who no &s;ooner has &s;een him depart, than he re&s;umes the com|mand with all the u&s;ual in&s;olence of office. But &s;hould this prince not mean to &s;tir from his e&s;tate, he goes to breakfa&s;t about ten o'clock, for which a table is &s;pread in the large hall, provided with a bacon ham, hung-beef, fowls, or pigeons broiled; plantains and &s;weet ca&s;&s;avas roa&s;ted; bread, butter, chee&s;e, &amp;c. with which he drinks &s;trong beer, and a gla&s;s of Madeira, Rheni&s;h, or Mozell wine, while the cringing over&s;eer &s;its at the farther end, keeping his proper di&s;tance, both being &s;erved by the mo&s;t beautiful &s;laves that can be &s;elected;&mdash;and this is called breaking the poor gentleman's fa&s;t.</P>
<P>After this he takes a book, plays at che&s;s or billiards, entertains him&s;elf with mu&s;ic, &amp;c. till the heat of the day forces him to return into his cotton hammock to enjoy his meridian nap, which he could no more di&s;pen&s;e with than a Spaniard with his <HI>fie&s;ta,</HI> and in which he rocks to and
<PB N="58" REF="72">
fro, like a performer on the &s;lack-rope, till he falls a&s;leep, without either bed or covering; and during which time he is fanned by a couple of his black attendants, to keep him cool, &amp;c.</P>
<P>About three o'clock he awakes by natural in&s;tinct, when having wa&s;hed and perfumed him&s;elf, he &s;its down to dinner, attended as at breakfa&s;t by his deputy governor and &s;able pages, where nothing is wanting that the world can afford in a we&s;tern climate, of meat, fowls, veni&s;on, fi&s;h, vegetables, fruits, &amp;c. and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite wines are often &s;quandered in profu&s;ion; after this a cup of &s;trong coffee and a liqueur fini&s;h the repa&s;t. At &s;ix o'clock he is again waited on by his over&s;eer, at|tended as in the morning by negro-drivers and pri&s;oners, when the flogging once more having continued for &s;ome time, and the nece&s;&s;ary orders being given for the next day's work, the a&s;&s;embly is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the evening &s;pent with weak punch, &s;angaree, cards and tobacco.&mdash; His wor&s;hip generally begins to yawn about ten or eleven o'clock, when he withdraws, and is undre&s;&s;ed by his &s;ooty pages. He then retires to re&s;t, where he pa&s;&s;es the night in the arms of one or other of his &s;able &s;ultanas (for he always keeps a &s;eraglio) till about &s;ix in the morning, when he again repairs to his piazza walk, where his pipe and coffee are waiting for him; and where, with the ri&s;|ing &s;un, he begins his round of di&s;&s;ipation, like a petty monarch, as capricious as he is de&s;potic and de&s;pi&s;eable.</P>
<P>Such ab&s;olute power indeed, cannot fail to be peculiarly
<PB N="59" REF="73">
delightful to a man, who, in all probability, was in his own country, Europe, a &mdash; nothing.</P>
<P>But, in this colony, this is too frequently the ca&s;e, where plantations are &s;old upon credit, and left (by the ab&s;ent proprietor) to the apprai&s;ers, who, by &s;elling cheap, have generally an under&s;tanding with the buyer.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the planters who are the pe&s;t of the colony; &s;uch as the &s;ine gentleman ju&s;t de&s;cribed, who, while he lives at the above rate, pays nobody, under pretence of bad crops, mortality among&s;t the &s;laves, &amp;c. but like an up&s;tart ra&s;cal ma&s;&s;acres the negroes by double labour, ruins and pillages the e&s;tate of all its productions, which he clande&s;tinely &s;ells for ready money, makes a pur&s;e, and runs away. Exceptions, however, take place in every circum&s;tance of life; and I have known many planters in Surinam as good men as I ever would de&s;ire to be ac|quainted with, which I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>As for the ladies, they indulge them&s;elves ju&s;t as much, by giving way to their unbounded pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;pecially to the mo&s;t relentle&s;s barbarity. But while I can bear witne&s;s to the exalted virtues of &s;uch a woman as Mrs. Elizabeth Danforth, now Mrs. Godfrey, and a few more who&s;e characters &s;hine with treble lu&s;tre, I &s;hall draw a veil over all the imperfections, too common to their &s;ex in this climate. Before I drop this &s;ubject, however, I mu&s;t atte&s;t, that ho&s;pitality is in no country practi&s;ed with greater cordiality or with le&s;s ceremony, a &s;tranger being every where at home, and finding his table and his bed
<PB N="60" REF="74">
at whatever e&s;tate nece&s;&s;ity or choice may occa&s;ion him to vi&s;it. This is the more to be regarded, as no inns are to be met with in the neighbourhood of any of the Surinam rivers.</P>
<P>To vary the &s;ubject a little, I will now de&s;cribe three kinds of fi&s;h, with which I occa&s;ionally entertained my friends. The <HI>&s;un-fi&s;h,</HI> the <HI>&s;nake-fi&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>&s;potted-cat.</HI> The fir&s;t frequents both the &s;alt and fre&s;h water, like the &s;almon: it is about eighteen or twenty inches long, &s;haped not unlike a kite; and being covered over with &s;cales of a golden colour, when it &s;wims in clear water darts forth very bright beams, from which it has derived its name of the <HI>&s;un-fi&s;h.</HI> The <HI>&s;nake-fi&s;h</HI> takes its name from its re&s;emblance to that reptile: this is a black eel with a white belly, it is not large, and is very common in all the rivers. The <HI>&s;potted-cat</HI> is called &s;o from its tabby colour, and long whi&s;kers: this fi&s;h is formed not unlike a <HI>pike,</HI> with very &s;harp teeth; it has no &s;cales, it is extremely fat, weighing &s;ometimes above &s;eventy pounds, but its fle&s;h is yellow, and not e&s;teemed the mo&s;t delicate food: however, here excellent fi&s;h is &s;eldom wanting, &s;uch as the <HI>new-mara, pa&s;&s;e&s;&s;ee, warappa, jackee,</HI> and many others already noticed. The Hope, with all this, was now truly a mo&s;t &s;hocking place of re&s;idence: here I much regretted my former cottage, and &s;weet com|panion, the one in ruins, the other at Paramaribo; while, at pre&s;ent, not a man was to be &s;een without an ague or fever, or &s;ome other wa&s;ting complaint. The dy&s;entery
<PB N="61" REF="75">
al&s;o began to make its appearance; and to add to our di&s;tre&s;s, we had neither &s;urgeon, medicines, nor &s;o much as a light, and very little bread left. I was moved with the &s;ituation of the troops, and again di&s;tributed all my bi&s;cuits, lemons, oranges, &s;ugar, wine, ducks and fowls, among&s;t the unhappy &s;ufferers, with a few &s;permaceti candles.</P>
<P>On the 23d I &s;ent up to the ho&s;pital at Magdenberg two &s;ick officers, <HI>Orleigh</HI> and <HI>Francen,</HI> with all the privates that could bear to be tran&s;ported; and, at the &s;ame time, I repeated my humble entreaties to be &s;oon relieved from &s;o very di&s;agreeable a &s;ituation (for the confine|ment to which there was not the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity), and reque&s;ted to be one of the party to march again&s;t the rebels, but to no purpo&s;e; while the accounts came from below that a fre&s;h ne&s;t of negroes were di&s;covered, even clo&s;e to Paramaribo, and the news came from above that the troops there were daily dying away; among&s;t others, on the 22d, expired a Captain Seyburg, brother to the Colonel. This was actually the third captain who died within the &s;pace of one month.</P>
<P>On the 26th two fine young officers arrived, unfit for &s;ervice by ruptures, occa&s;ioned by the &s;lippery &s;tate of the ground in the rainy &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This evening one of our marines named Spanknevel, was mi&s;&s;ing, and was not found till the 29th, when he was di&s;covered &s;u&s;pended by a nebee to the branch of a tree. Not one of his comrades would cut him down, he
<PB N="62" REF="76">
having hanged him&s;elf; alledging, that to touch him, ac|cording to their prejudices, (being Germans) would ren|der them as infamous as him&s;elf. Wherefore, by my orders, he was taken down, and interred by the negroes.</P>
<P>An order at la&s;t came for my relief, and I immediately &s;et out for Goed-Accoord, in company with Captain Bolts; where the planter, Mr. de Lange, and his lady, received us with great ho&s;pitality. This &s;ugar e&s;tate being the farthe&s;t that is cultivated in Rio Comewina, and con&s;e|quently expo&s;ed to the neighbourhood of the rebel ne|groes, makes the &s;laves liable to their &s;eductions; they are therefore treated with peculiar kindne&s;s and indul|gence, to prevent their concurring in any in&s;urrection, or being per&s;uaded to leave their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw a great novelty indeed, the young negro women waiting at the table all &s;tark naked, as they came into the world. I was at fir&s;t &s;tartled at the unu&s;ual ap|pearance; and a&s;king the cau&s;e, was mode&s;tly an&s;wered by the lady of the hou&s;e, that it was ordered &s;o by their mothers and matrons, to prevent (by &s;uch means of de|tection, &s;aid they) their too early intercour&s;e with the males, and child-bearing, which would &s;poil their &s;hapes, weaken their &s;trength, and cramp their growth. Indeed finer made figures I never beheld than were both the men (witne&s;s Philander) and the women on this plan|tation, who&s;e beautiful &s;hapes, liveline&s;s, &s;trength, and activity, were inferior to no Europeans.</P>
<P>Next day we departed for Magdenburg an hour before
<PB N="63" REF="77">
&s;un-&s;et, again&s;t the advice of Mr. and Mrs. de Lange, in a &s;mall barge, covered only with a loo&s;e awning. We had not rowed above two miles when not only night came on, but we were overtaken by &s;uch a &s;hower of rain, as had nearly &s;unk us, the boat's gunwale not being more than two inches above the water: however, by the help of our hats and caliba&s;hes, we kept her afloat, while a negro &s;at upon the bow, holding out a boat-hook &s;traight before him to prevent us from being over&s;et, by inadver|tently running, in pitch darkne&s;s, again&s;t the roots of ma|groves, &amp;c. which thickly lined both the banks of the river all the way upwards.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of wet and ob&s;curity, at ten o'clock at night, we came to the Jacob, being ju&s;t afloat and no more; for Bolts and I had no &s;ooner leaped on the beach, than the boat &s;unk with all that was in her, the &s;laves luckily &s;wim|ming a&s;hore. Alas! among&s;t the wreck, was my poor box, with my journal, and all my paintings, which had co&s;t me above two long years &s;o much labour, care, and attention. I was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this lo&s;s, when a &s;kilful negro dived &s;everal times to the bottom, and at la&s;t brought up my little trea&s;ure, which, though thoroughly &s;oaked, I was very happy to have again in my hands. Thus ended our &s;hipwreck, when having drank &s;ome warm grog and &s;lung our hammocks, we all fell a&s;leep round a good fire, by which I made &s;hift to dry my&s;elf, and, what was of more con&s;equence, my papers.</P>
<P>The following morning we again &s;et out, and rowed for
<PB N="64" REF="78">
Magdenberg, but about half-way our voyage was once more ob&s;tructed by an enormous tree which had acciden|tally fallen acro&s;s the Creek, &s;o that we could neither drag the boat over nor under it. Thus we were again obliged to return to the Jacob, whence we now proceeded to Mag|denberg on foot, through thorns, roots, brambles, and briars, and where we finally arrived wet and bloody; and my ancle, which had been nearly well, fre&s;h wounded to the bone, the &s;kin and fle&s;h being quite torn away by the numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions to our &s;teps.</P>
<P>Here we were acquainted that Mr. Orleigh, one of the two officers that I had &s;ent up to Magdenberg from the Hope on the 23d, was no more. Thus died almo&s;t all our gentlemen, who had been during the la&s;t month upon the hopele&s;s Hope, from which now &s;carcely one &s;ingle private returned in health; and this, I am firmly of opi|nion, was greatly owing to the dry and burning month of June, when the &s;un &s;uddenly &s;corched them, after marching and even &s;leeping in cold watery &s;wamps, and con&s;tant heavy &s;howers during the rainy &s;ea&s;on. How|ever, I hitherto e&s;caped by the &s;trength of my con&s;titu|tion and good &s;pirits, which I determined by every po&s;&s;ible means to keep from depre&s;&s;ion, by laughing, whi&s;tling, &s;inging, and (God forgive me!) &s;ometimes &s;wearing, while all the re&s;t were &s;ighing, bewailing, and dying around me.</P>

<P>THE rainy &s;ea&s;on being again approaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIX.</NOTE> Colonel Fourgeoud, having &s;elected all the remaining healthy people, who now amounted to but one hundred and eighty in number, on the 3d of July, 1775, pro|ceeded on his march for Barbacoeba, in the river Cottica; which &s;pot he appointed for the general rendezvous, previous to the grand attack on the rebels. Of this party I had the honour to be one: but on the &s;urgeon's de|claring that I &s;hould run the hazard of lo&s;ing my foot if I marched in the woods, I was ordered to remain at Magdenberg, with liberty, if I &s;oon recovered, to join Fourgeoud, and make the be&s;t of my way to Barbacoeba. My limb, indeed, was now &s;o &s;welled, and my wound &s;o black with the mortification, that an amputation was dreaded by Mr. Knollaert, Fourgeoud's &s;urgeon, and I could not even &s;tand without excruciating pain.&mdash;I &s;hall bear the mark of it as long as I live.</P>
<P>During this confinement I received daily pre&s;ents from Philander and the other negroes, as I was always kind to
<PB N="66" REF="80">
them. Among the&s;e was a di&s;h of mountain-cabbage. This is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed of all the various &s;orts which grow, as I have mentioned formerly, on the different &s;pecies of palm-trees; this tree grows &s;ometimes near fifty feet high, the trunk of a brown colour, hard, ligneous, divided into &s;hort joints, and pithy within, like the elder: it is thick in proportion, &s;treight and tapering like the ma&s;t of a &s;hip; near the top the tree a&s;&s;umes a fluted form and a green colour, occa&s;ioned by the hu&s;ky tegument that forms the branches; which, near the &s;ummit, diverge in a horizontal di|rection, like the crown of a pine-apple or ananas. The&s;e branches are covered over on both &s;ides with &s;trong pinnated leaves about three feet long, of a deep green colour, and &s;harp pointed, but folded and confu&s;edly in|termixed, not gracefully drooping like tho&s;e of the mani|cole or cocoa-nut trees. The &s;eed is inclo&s;ed in a brown|i&s;h kind of &s;patha, that ari&s;es from the center of the branches, and hanging downwards con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall roundi&s;h nuts, not unlike a bunch of dried grapes, but much longer in proportion to their circumference. If the cabbage is wanted, the whole tree mu&s;t be cut down, when it is dive&s;ted fir&s;t of its branches, and next of that fluted green hu&s;ky tegument that forms them; after this the heart or cabbage is taken out, white, and about two or three feet long: it is as thick as a man's arm, and round like a poli&s;hed ivory cylinder; it is compo&s;ed of a kind of tender longitudinal white flakes, like &s;ilk ribbands, ready
<PB N="67" REF="81">
to form the &s;ucceeding green tegument, but &s;o clo&s;e that they form a cri&s;p &s;olid body. This, when eaten raw, is in ta&s;te &s;omething like the kernel of an almond, but is more tender and more delicious; when cut in pieces and boiled, it eats like cauliflower: it may be al&s;o peeled in the above-mentioned long thin flakes, and then it makes an excellent &s;allad; but too much of it, whether eaten raw or dre&s;&s;ed, is unwhole&s;ome, as it is apt to occa&s;ion a diarrhoea. It is in the cavity, after the cabbage is removed from it, that a black beetle depo&s;its its &s;pawn, from which the palm-tree worms are produced, which feed on the remaining tender &s;ub&s;tance when it begins to rot, till they acquire the &s;ize already mentioned; though tho&s;e in the manicole tree, and other trees of the palm &s;pecies, grow not &s;o large, are le&s;s &s;weet, and are al&s;o differently &s;haped.</P>
<P>The <HI>maureecee</HI> tree, by the French called <HI>latanie,</HI> is certainly the talle&s;t of all the palm-tree &s;pecies; or, in|deed, of any &s;pecies in the fore&s;t of Guiana. And I can aver, that I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e trees who&s;e lofty &s;ummits appeared to ri&s;e no le&s;s than a hundred feet from the &s;urface of the earth, while the circumference of their trunks was about ten or twelve feet where thicke&s;t; the trunk of this tree is large&s;t at about one-fourth of its height from the root, whence it tapers not only upwards but downwards al&s;o: this &s;ingularity has perhaps e&s;caped all other writers. It is of a light brown or grey-colour, and divided in joints all the way upwards to its branches, when (but at a great height, and near the top) it diverges in long
<PB N="68" REF="82">
green arched branches, naked till near their extremity, when the&s;e again diverge or digitate in long broad leaves of a pale green colour, and di&s;po&s;ed in an orbicular man|ner with great regularity, not unlike &s;un-beams, or a lady's fan expanded. As the young branches &s;pring up from the centre at the &s;ummit, the old ones fade at the bottom and hang downwards, &s;hrivelled and dangling in the wind. From the heart of the green leaves the In|dians draw out long white fibres or threads, as they do from the &s;ilk-gra&s;s plant: the&s;e, being equally &s;trong, &s;erve as cords when twi&s;ted to &s;tring their bows, to make nets, or to be u&s;ed as threads; from the middle of the branches appears the &s;eed, hanging down al&s;o in the form of a large rope of onions. I have &s;een many prints re|pre&s;enting palm-trees, but I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay that mo&s;t of them are impo&s;itions on the public, having either been executed from fancy, or from a very bad de&s;cription; but I can a&s;&s;ure my readers, that all tho&s;e which I repre&s;ent were taken from nature, and on the &s;pot: I &s;peak of the cocoa-nut tree, the manicola, the mountain-cabbage, and the maureecee trees, who&s;e branches and leaves are all extremely different from each other; and I have not confounded the &s;pecies, as they are in too many publications. The two fir&s;t the reader has already &s;een; and the two others I now offer to his view, where <HI>A</HI> is the trunk of the mountain-cabbage-tree; <HI>B</HI> one of its branches, &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and <HI>C</HI> the &s;eed or hu&s;ky &s;patha inclo&s;ing it; <HI>D</HI> is the trunk of the maureecee-tree, and <HI>E</HI> one of its branches dropping

down. <HI>F</HI> is the beetle that produces the maureecee worms, <HI>G,</HI> which are not &s;o large nor &s;o delicious as tho&s;e produced by the mountain-cabbage. Having had no op|portunity of &s;hewing in what manner the Indians and Africans a&s;cend trees, by figure <HI>H</HI> I have repre&s;ented a negro climbing a young maureecee-tree, to which they do not cling with their arms and legs, but taking the trunk between their hands, they place the &s;oles of their feet again&s;t it, and thus walk up in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing manner; by this method they &s;ave their &s;kin from the bark, but it mu&s;t certainly require very great &s;trength, activity, and practice.</P>
<P>Having thus far dwelt on the palm-tree &s;pecies, I mu&s;t once more return to dome&s;tic occurrences.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that all the officers and mo&s;t of the privates who had lately been &s;tationed at the Hope, had died, or were &s;ent up dangerou&s;ly ill, while I had e&s;caped the contagion. But, alas! now it became my turn, having only had a reprieve, and no more: for on the 9th I was &s;eized with the &s;ame burning fever that had carried off the re&s;t; and even my black boy Quaco was very ill.</P>
<P>On the 14th, nece&s;&s;ity forced me to give up the com|mand to another officer, and depart from this inho&s;pitable &s;pot on my way to Paramaribo: I could however reach no farther than Goet Accoord, and there, on the 15th, all expected my death; when an old negro woman found means to make me partake of &s;ome butter-milk boiled with &s;ome barley and mela&s;&s;es, which was the fir&s;t food
<PB N="70" REF="85">
I had ta&s;ted &s;ince I was taken ill. This certainly did me infinite &s;ervice; and the day following I was again able to be tran&s;ported: the black boy al&s;o was much better.</P>
<P>The evening of the 15th I reached Fauconberg, where I was met by a packet of &s;ix or eight letters from different friends, accompanied with pre&s;ents of hung-beef, bul|locks tongues, Madeira, porter, rum, and two gallons of excellent &s;hrub, be&s;ides a fine bacon ham, and a beautiful pointer; both the la&s;t from the identical Charles Mac|donald, the Engli&s;h &s;ailor, which he had brought me from Virginia, in return for the little civility I had for|merly &s;hewn him &s;o unexpectedly at the Hope. This mark of the poor fellow's gratitude and genero&s;ity, the true characteri&s;tics of a Briti&s;h tar, gave me greater plea|&s;ure than all the things I received put together. But &s;till I mu&s;t except two letters, the one from Mr. Lude at Am&s;ter|dam, and the other from Mr. de Graav, his admini&s;trator at Paramaribo, acquainting me finally, and to my heart-felt &s;atisfaction, that the amiable Joanna and the little boy were at my di&s;po&s;al, but at no le&s;s a price than two thou&s;and florins, amounting, with other expences, to near two hundred pounds &s;terling, a &s;um which I was totally unable to rai&s;e. I already owed the &s;um of fifty pounds, that I had borrowed for the black boy Quaco's redemption; but Joanna was to me invaluable, and though apprai&s;ed at one-twentieth part of the whole e&s;tate, which had been &s;old for forty thou&s;and florins, no

and this news, on its fir&s;t arrival, had indeed the mo&s;t re|viving effect on me: but when reflection taught me how impo&s;&s;ible it was for me to obtain &s;uch a &s;um of money, and while I was employed in giving all the pre&s;ents I had received (except the ham and the dog) to Joanna's rela|tions at Fauconberg, who loaded me with adorations and care&s;&s;es, I exclaimed, with a bitter &s;igh,

I now found my&s;elf, though ex|ceedingly weak, however &s;o much better, that on the next day I went down &s;o far as the e&s;tate Berg&s;hove, whence the admini&s;trator, a Mr. Gourlay, humanely cau&s;ed me to be tran&s;ported to Paramaribo in a decent tent-barge with &s;ix oars; but relap&s;ing, I arrived ju&s;t alive on the evening of the 19th, having pa&s;t the preceding night on the e&s;tate called the Jalo&s;ee, apparently dead.</P>

<P>Being now in a comfortable lodging at Mr. de la Mare's, and attended by &s;o good a creature as Joanna, I reco|vered apace; and on the 25th was &s;o well, that I was able to walk out for the fir&s;t time, when I dined with Mrs. Gode|froy,
<PB N="72" REF="88">
Mr. de Graav not being in town to concert matters relative to the emancipation of Joanna, who had now once more literally &s;aved my life. At this table there was never wanting all the whole&s;ome and refre&s;hing nouri&s;h|ment that I &s;tood in need of, with the be&s;t of fruits and wines. Among the articles conducive to the re&s;toration of health, are reckoned in this country all the different kinds of pepper which it affords, and the no le&s;s effica|cious acid of limes. Among the fir&s;t are the <HI>cica</HI> pepper, the <HI>lattacaca,</HI> and the <HI>dago-peepee,</HI> as they are called in Surinam; for the negroes name each thing from the re|&s;emblance it bears to another: but the&s;e are known in Europe by the names of Cayenne, Pimento, and Cap&s;i|cum. The fir&s;t is properly called Cayenne from the French &s;ettlement of that name in Guiana; but the name <HI>cica</HI> or <HI>chica</HI> is derived from its round &s;hape and &s;ize, re|&s;embling the in&s;ect called <HI>chiga</HI> or <HI>chigo&egrave;,</HI> already de|&s;cribed; the next re&s;embles rats excrements, &amp;c. All the above &s;pecies, be&s;ides &s;ome others, grow on low green &s;hrubs, they all equally excoriate the mouth, have all the &s;ame fiery qualities, and when ripe are of a &s;carlet or ra|ther a blood colour. The Europeans &s;eldom eat any thing without it; but the blacks, and e&s;pecially the In|dians, &s;wallow it I might &s;ay by handfuls, not only as a reli&s;h, but as a remedy in almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The limes grow on beautiful trees like lemons, but the leaf and the fruit are much &s;maller; they are rather a brighter yellow than the lemons, have a &s;ine thin &s;hell,
<PB N="73" REF="89">
and are extremely full of the riche&s;t acid that I know, which has a particularly fine flavour, and is a great ble&s;|&s;ing to the &s;ick &s;oldiers and &s;ailors in this colony, who have them for the trouble of gathering; &s;o that it is not uncommon to &s;ee the tars employing their lei&s;ure time in picking and carrying large hampers full to their ve&s;&s;els. In Surinam there are whole hedges of lime-trees, and all round Paramaribo they grow wild. It is much to be la|mented that, among other articles of luxury, this fruit cannot be tran&s;ported to Europe; but whole ca&s;ks of this juice are frequently &s;ent over, and they are al&s;o pickled and pre&s;erved in large jars by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>At the de&s;&s;ert, among many other excellent fruits, I ob&s;erved one which is here called the <HI>mammee</HI> apple: it grows on a tree about the &s;ize of an orange-tree, with a grey-coloured bark; the wood is whiti&s;h, and coar&s;e; the leaf very thick, poli&s;hed, and of a triangular form, without &s;ibres. This fruit is nearly round, and is about five or &s;ix inches in diameter, covered with a ru&s;ty coar&s;e &s;kin: the pulp has the colour and con&s;i&s;tency of a carrot, enclo&s;ing two large &s;tones with bitter kernels, but the fruit is of a de|licious ta&s;te, &s;weet mixed with acid, and a &s;mell &s;uperior in fragrance to almo&s;t any other fruit in the colony. There were al&s;o nuts of two &s;pecies, u&s;ually called pi&s;tachios, and by the negroes <HI>pinda</HI>; one kind of them re&s;embles &s;mall che&s;nuts, and the&s;e grow in bunches on a tree. The others are produced by a &s;hrub, and grow under ground; both have &s;weet oily kernels: of the la&s;t there are two
<PB N="74" REF="90">
in one pod; they are agreeable eating raw, but &s;till better when roa&s;ted in hot a&s;hes. To illu&s;trate the above de|&s;criptions, I pre&s;ent the reader with the plate annexed, where <HI>A</HI> is a &s;prig of limes in full ripene&s;s; <HI>B,</HI> the Cay|enne or <HI>cica</HI> pepper; <HI>C,</HI> the pimento pepper or <HI>lattacaca; D,</HI> the cap&s;icum called <HI>dago-peepee; E,</HI> the mammee apple when it is fully ripe; <HI>F,</HI> the leaf above, of a beauti|ful green; <HI>G,</HI> the leaf below, of a yellowi&s;h green; <HI>H,</HI> the pi&s;tachio nut in the hu&s;k; <HI>I,</HI> the ground pi&s;tachio in its dried &s;tate; <HI>K,</HI> one of the kernels belonging to the latter.</P>
<P>The whole of the above were taken from nature, though upon a &s;mall &s;cale; yet I flatter my&s;elf they will be found more perfect copies of the originals than &s;ome of Mad. Me|rian's, with all their boa&s;ted reputation.&mdash;I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without a few other remarks on the incorrect|ne&s;s of this lady's drawings. For in&s;tance, her leaf of the lime-tree is evidently too round; and if by her <HI>pali&s;ade branch,</HI> in plate XI. &s;he means the manicole-tree, I mu&s;t declare I never di&s;covered &s;uch a leaf among the many thou&s;ands I have helped to cut down. Her cotton twig, and e&s;pecially the pod containing the cotton, are al&s;o no true repre&s;entation of tho&s;e which are produced in Su|rinam.</P>
<P>In another place &s;he declares, that grapes are common in Guiana&mdash;which I al&s;o mu&s;t contradict; for it is well known, that no thin-&s;kinned fruit can ever come to perfection in a tropical climate, &s;uch as grapes, cherries, currants,

&s;trawberries, plums, apricots, and peaches, nor even common apples or pears.</P>
<P>From the above ob&s;ervations, I take the liberty to &s;ay, that allowing Mad. Merian due prai&s;e for her beautiful and valuable performance upon the whole, &s;he has &s;till fallen into very notable mi&s;takes. To correct them is a duty incumbent on future ob&s;ervers; nor does it by any means imply a general cen&s;ure on the elegant work in que&s;|tion, nor can it appear extraordinary that it &s;hould contain &s;ome errors, when we con&s;ider that it is above an hundred years ago &s;ince &s;he pre&s;ented her di&s;coveries to the world. In the cour&s;e of &s;o many years therefore mankind, by long experience and continued inve&s;tigation, have become more enlightened, and are more accurately informed.</P>
<P>Being now once more at Paramaribo, it may not be im|proper to divert our attention for a while from the ani|mal and vegetable productions to the government of this fine colony; a topic which, I am per&s;uaded, &s;ome of my readers have long &s;ince expected; but not having had a previous opportunity of gratifying their curio&s;ity, I will no longer delay the nece&s;&s;ary information, though to &s;ome the detail may appear dry and unentertaining.</P>

<PB N="79" REF="96">
colony, by proper management, might be made a garden of Eden, not only for the European &s;ettlers, but al&s;o for their African dome&s;tics. It would not indeed be diffi|cult to &s;ugge&s;t improvements, nor even to carry them into effect. What has occurred to me upon the &s;ubject, I will candidly &s;tate on another occa&s;ion; and I have no doubt but a little attention even to one &s;ingle point would be productive of the happie&s;t con&s;equences. Thus, if I cannot on the &s;pot, like the good Samaritan, pour the balm into the wound of any one &s;ufferer, at lea&s;t I can leave the pre&s;cription, which, if properly applied, would, I am per|&s;uaded, afford relief to the complaints of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>I have undertaken the unplea&s;ing ta&s;k of &s;hewing how, by the de&s;perate means of blood, the colony was frequently &s;aved from total annihilation.

<P>Thus much for the political government of Surinam; which I will not leave without tran&s;cribing its motto, &s;o very contrary to what they profe&s;s, being

The arms are tripartite, which I appre|hend to be &s;ome of tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of Somel&s;dyke, the We&s;t India company, and the town of Am&s;terdam, crowned and &s;upported by two lions rampant, and with
<PB N="80" REF="97">
the&s;e are &s;tamped all their card money, &amp;c. &mdash; But to proceed with my journal.</P>
<P>On the 30th I met the poor &s;ailor, Charles Macdonald, and having ju&s;t bought thirty gallons of Grenada rum, I gave him a hand&s;ome return for his bacon ham and his dog, be&s;ides a fine cork-&s;crew (mother-of-pearl &s;et in &s;ilver) as a keep-&s;ake, he being to &s;ail the day following for Virginia, on board the Peggy, Captain Lewis, who, at my recommendation, promi&s;ed to make him his mate. As I am &s;peaking of dogs, I mu&s;t make two general re|marks on the&s;e animals in Guiana, <HI>viz.</HI> that in this quarter of the world they lo&s;e the faculty, or at lea&s;t the habit, of barking; and it is a known fact, that the native dogs never bark at all. In this country, it is ob&s;erved al&s;o, that dogs are never &s;eized with the hydrophobia, at lea&s;t I never remember to have &s;een or heard of a mad dog in Surinam: and this is the more &s;ingular, as that dreadful di&s;temper is generally attributed in other countries to the inten&s;e heat of the <HI>Caniculares</HI> or dog-days, as that appel|lation &s;ufficiently indicates. The Indians or natives of Gui|ana all keep dogs, which they u&s;e in hunting; they are of a dirty white colour, meagre, and &s;mall, with &s;hort hair, a &s;harp muzzle, and erect ears: all the&s;e are very dexte|rous in finding game; but they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the mi&s;|chievous qualities of the terrier. I ought not to forget that if the American dogs do not bark, their howl is very loud; on this account my Virginian dog was &s;o trouble|&s;ome,
<PB N="81" REF="98">
that he got his brains knocked out by the neigh|bours within a fortnight after he was in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About this period &s;everal <HI>American</HI> families arrived at Paramaribo, on account of the war which broke out be|tween the mother country and her colonies. For many of the&s;e I felt very much; and mu&s;t ever declare, that no people could have a better heart or greater friend&s;hip for a Briti&s;h individual than they had for me, which they &s;hewed on many different occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the 3d of Augu&s;t, Mr. de Graav being arrived in town, having finally &s;ettled affairs with Mr. Lolkens, the late admini&s;trator of Fauconberg, I now thought proper to take the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;ettling matters with him, by propo&s;ing him to give me credit till I &s;hould have it in my power to pay the money for which Joanna and my Johnny had been &s;old to me, and which I was deter|mined to &s;ave out of my pay, if I &s;hould exi&s;t on bread, &s;alt, and water: though even then this debt could not be di&s;charged in le&s;s time than two or three years. Provi|dence however interfered, and at this moment &s;ent that excellent woman, Mrs. Godefroy, to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: for no &s;ooner was &s;he acquainted with my difficult and anxious &s;ituation, than &s;he &s;ent for me to dine with her, when &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me in the following terms:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know, good Stedman, the pre&s;ent feelings of your heart, and the incapacity of an officer, from his income only, to accompli&s;h &s;uch a purpo&s;e as the comple|tion of your wi&s;hes. But know, that even in Surinam
<PB N="82" REF="99">
virtue will meet with friends. Your manly &s;en&s;ibility for that de&s;erving young woman and her child mu&s;t claim the e&s;teem of all rational per&s;ons, in &s;pite of ma|lice and folly: and &s;o much has this action recom|mended you to my attention in particular, that I &s;hould think my&s;elf culpable in not patronizing your lauda|ble intentions. Permit me then to participate in your happine&s;s, and in the future pro&s;pect of the virtuous Joanna and her little boy, by reque&s;ting your accept|ance of the &s;um of <HI>two thou&s;and florins,</HI> or any &s;um you &s;tand in need of; with which money go imme|diately, Stedman, go and redeem innocence, good &s;en&s;e, and beauty from the jaws of tyranny, oppre&s;|&s;ion, and in&s;ult."</Q></P>
<P>Seeing me thunder-&s;truck, and gazing upon her in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, without the power of &s;peaking, &s;he continued, with a divine benignity:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let not your delicacy, my friend, take the alarm, and interfere in this bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;oldiers and &s;ailors ought ever to be the men of fewe&s;t compliments; and all I expect from you is, that you &s;ay not one word more on the &s;ubject."</Q>
&mdash;As &s;oon as I recovered I replied,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I was at a lo&s;s how to expre&s;s my ad|miration of &s;uch benevolence."</Q>
I &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Joanna, who had &s;o frequently pre&s;erved my life, had cer|tainly merited my eternal affection; but that my gra|titude could not be le&s;s to one who had &s;o generou&s;ly put me in the way of redeeming that invaluable wo|man
<PB N="83" REF="100">
from &s;lavery;"</Q>
and concluded with ob&s;erving,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I could not now touch a &s;hilling of <HI>the money,</HI> but &s;hould have the honour to call upon her the next day; and immediately retired."</Q></P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner returned home, than I acquainted Joanna with all that had happened; who, bur&s;ting into tears, called out, "<HI>Gado &s;a bre&s;&s;e da woma!</HI>"&mdash; "God will ble&s;s this woman!" and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he her&s;elf &s;hould be mortgaged to Mrs. Godefroy till every farthing &s;hould be paid: &s;he indeed was very anxious to &s;ee the emancipation of her boy, but till that was done, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept of her own freedom. I &s;hall not here endeavour to paint the conte&s;t which I &s;u&s;tained between affection and duty, but bluntly &s;ay that I yielded to the wi&s;h of this &s;o charm|ing creature, and who&s;e &s;entiments endeared her to me &s;till more. Thus I in&s;tantly drew up a paper, declaring my Joanna, according to her de&s;ire, from this day to be the property of Mrs. Godefroy, till the la&s;t farthing of the money &s;he lent me &s;hould be repaid; and, on the follow|ing day, with the con&s;ent of her relations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Without the con&s;ent of parents, brothers, and &s;i&s;ters, no re&s;pectable &s;laves are individually &s;old in Surinam.</NOTE>, I conducted her to Mrs. Godefroy's hou&s;e, where, throwing her&s;elf at the feet of that incomparable woman, Joanna her&s;elf put the paper into her hands; but this lady having rai&s;ed her up, no &s;ooner had read the contents, than &s;he ex|claimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mu&s;t it be &s;o? Then come here, my Joanna,
<PB N="84" REF="101">
I have a &s;pirit to accept of you not as my &s;lave, but more as my companion: you &s;hall have a hou&s;e built in my orange-garden, with my own &s;laves to attend you, till Providence &s;hall call me away, when you &s;hall be per|fectly free, as indeed you now are the moment you wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s your manumi&s;&s;ion; and this you claim both by your extraction and your conduct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have already mentioned that Joanna was by birth a gentleman's daughter from Holland; and her mother's family were mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed people on the coa&s;t of Africa.</NOTE>."</Q>
On the&s;e terms, and on no other, I accepted of the money on the 5th, and carrying it in my hat to Mr. de Graav's, I laid it on his table, demanding a receipt in full; and Joanna was transferred from the wretched e&s;tate Fau|conberg, to the protection of the fir&s;t woman perhaps in all the Dutch We&s;t-Indies, if not in the world; and for which &s;he thanked me with a look that could only be ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the COUNTENANCE OF AN ANGEL.</P>
<P>Mr. de Graav, on counting the money, addre&s;&s;ed me in the following terms:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Stedman, two hundred florins of this &s;um belong to me as admini&s;trator. Permit me al&s;o to have a &s;mall &s;hare in this happy event, by not accepting this dividend, as I &s;hall find my&s;elf amply paid by the plea&s;ure of having been in&s;trumental in bringing about what &s;eems &s;o much to contribute to the enjoyment of two de&s;erving people."</Q></P>
<P>Having thanked my di&s;intere&s;ted friend with an affec|tionate &s;hake by the hand, I immediately returned the
<PB N="85" REF="102">
two hundred florins to Mrs. Godefroy, and all were happy. I mu&s;t not omit, as a farther proof of Mrs. Gode|froy's humane character, that on hearing of the dejected &s;ituation of the &s;ick at Magdenberg, &s;he at this time &s;ent them a pre&s;ent of a whole barge-load of fruit, vegeta|bles, and refre&s;hments of every kind that the colony could afford, for their relief.</P>
<P>On the 7th of April, matters being thus far &s;ettled, I wrote a letter to Mr. Lude, at Am&s;terdam, to give him in|telligence, and to thank him for having parted with the <HI>mo&s;t valuable</HI> property of his e&s;tate; and my ancle being now pretty well recovered, I al&s;o wrote to Colonel Four|geoud, that I &s;hould have the honour to join him in a few days. This letter I directed to Barbacoeba, for there he &s;till continued, while the intrepid and active militia captain, Stoeleman, was beating up the woods with a few rangers at another quarter, and who this day &s;ent in four captive rebel negroes to Paramaribo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a maxim with the rangers to chop off the right hand of every rebel negro they kill, for which they receive twenty-five florins; and for every one they &s;end in alive fifty florins; al&s;o for finding a town or village one thou&s;and florins Hollands.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 10th, finding my&s;elf &s;ufficiently recovered, and ready once more to enter the fore&s;t, I bade farewell to my &s;weet family and friends, leaving the fir&s;t &s;till at Mr. de la Mare's, at their reque&s;t; and cheerfully &s;et off with a tent|boat on my <HI>fifth</HI> campaign, in the hopes of accompany|ing Fourgeoud; who, having a&s;&s;embled all his remaining forces, and made the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements to attack
<PB N="86" REF="103">
the enemy, was now determined to march in a very few days.</P>
<P>On the 14th I arrived with a boat at Barbacoeba, in the upper part of the river Cottica, where formerly I was when I killed the <HI>aboma</HI> &s;nake. I found here the old gentleman (who civilly welcomed me) ready to &s;tart the following day. I never &s;aw the troops in &s;uch fine &s;pi|rits, or &s;o eager for &s;ervice; which proceeded from differ|ent motives, as I had &s;aid before, &s;ome in the hopes of plunder, &s;ome from revenge on the rebels, and &s;ome from a wi&s;h to &s;ee the war at an end; while I believe in my &s;oul, that others were tired of exi&s;tence by con|tinual illne&s;s and hard &s;ervice; and heartily wi&s;hed for a glorious end of all their mi&s;eries&mdash;as nothing can be more wretched than a &s;oldier's or a &s;ailor's life, perpe|tually &s;oaking in the wet or &s;corching in the &s;un, &s;ur|rounded by an unbounded fore&s;t, and in a tropical climate.</P>

<P>ON the 15th of Augu&s;t 1775, the rebels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XX.</NOTE> flu&s;hed with their late victory over Captain Meyland and his party, whether with a de&s;ign to brave Fourgeoud, or to intimidate his troops, being well appri&s;ed by their &s;pies that he was at Barbacoeba, had the a&s;&s;urance to &s;et fire to all the huts in two different camps which had been left &s;tanding by his patroles, while they continued &s;houting and hallooing the whole night within our hearing; but this only proved an incentive to action, and enraged our veteran commander &s;o much, that he now declared he would have ample revenge at all hazards. During this night a large tiger al&s;o alarmed the camp, but did no da|mage of any kind.</P>
<P>An hour before day-break next morning, Colonel Fourgeoud, with his troops, were ready to march, and immediately entered the woods. They now amounted exactly to two hundred Europeans fit for &s;ervice, the re&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="105">
being ill and unfit for &s;ervice; but no rangers were as yet arrived, though they had been expected. The fact was, they were &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted with Fourgeoud's command, that they did not appear at all, which afforded this gentleman for once an opportunity of &s;tigmatizing them as a band of pu&s;illanimous ra&s;cals; and I confe&s;s I was my&s;elf extremely a&s;toni&s;hed at this wilful ab&s;ence of my black favourites, who were at other times &s;o eager to ru&s;h upon the enemy, and had declared their &s;atisfaction at the hopes of a deci&s;ive engagement with their fable countrymen.</P>
<P>This whole day our cour&s;e was due E.; and after pro|ceeding about eight miles (which is a great di&s;tance in this country, where the pioneers with bill-hooks mu&s;t con|&s;tantly open a path), we erected huts, and encamped. Having frequently mentioned the <HI>rebel-negroes</HI> with whom we were now certain to have a rencontre, I pre|&s;ent the reader with the figure of one of the&s;e people, upon his guard, as alarmed by a ru&s;tling among&s;t the bu&s;hes. At a di&s;tance are &s;uppo&s;ed a couple of our rangers, waiting the moment to take him by &s;urprize. This rebel negro is armed with a firelock and a hatchet; his hair, though woolly, may be ob&s;erved to be plaited clo&s;e to his head, by way of di&s;tinction from the rangers, or any other &s;traggling negroes, who are not yet accepted among&s;t them; his beard is grown to a point, like that of all the Africans, when they have no op|portunity of &s;having. The principal dre&s;s of this man
<PB REF="106">

<PB N="89" REF="107">
con&s;i&s;ts of a cotton &s;heet, negligently tied acro&s;s his &s;houlders, which protects him from the weather, and &s;erves him al&s;o to re&s;t on; while he always &s;leeps under cover in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure places he can find, when de|tached from his companions. The re&s;t of his dre&s;s is a cami&s;a, tied around his loins like a handkerchief; his pouch, which is made of &s;ome animal's &s;kin; a few cotton &s;trings for ornament around his ancles and wri&s;ts; and a &s;uper&s;titious <HI>obia</HI> or amulet tied about his neck, in which he places all his confidence. The &s;kull and ribs are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bones of his enemies, &s;cattered upon the &s;andy &s;avannah.</P>
<P>The two rangers who make their appearance at a di&s;|tance may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their <HI>red caps</HI>; and here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the rebels have many times availed them&s;elves of &s;eizing one of the&s;e &s;carlet di&s;tinctions, which by clapping on their own heads in an engagement, has not only &s;aved their lives, but given them an oppor|tunity of &s;hooting their enemies.</P>
<P>Another &s;tratagem of theirs has &s;ometimes been di&s;|covered, <HI>viz.</HI> that fire-arms being &s;carce among&s;t them, numbers have intermixed in the crowd, with a <HI>crooked &s;lick</HI> &s;haped &s;omething like a mu&s;ket; and this appear|ance has more than once had the effect of preventing a proper defence by the plantation &s;laves, when the rebels came to ran&s;ack the e&s;tates; while with this &s;how of armed numbers they have often &s;truck &s;uch a panic, and &s;o damped the courage of the former, that they have
<PB N="90" REF="108">
been calmly permitted, after burning their hou&s;es, even to carry away their wives and daughters.</P>
<P>On the 16th we continued our march due E. upon a ridge or elevated ground. The&s;e ridges, if I mi&s;take not, run generally in this country E. and W. as do al&s;o mo&s;t of the mar&s;hes and &s;wamps. Having advanced rather a le&s;s di&s;tance than we did the day before, we were ordered early to &s;ling our hammocks, and to &s;leep without any covering, to prevent the enemy from hearing the &s;ound of cutting the trees; nor were any fires allowed to be lighted, nor a word to be &s;poken, while a &s;trict watch was kept round the camp. The&s;e, in fact, were all very ne|ce&s;&s;ary precautions; but if we were not di&s;covered by the enemy, we were almo&s;t devoured by the clouds of <HI>gnats</HI> or mu&s;quitoes, which aro&s;e from a neighbouring mar&s;h: for my own part I &s;uffered more here than I had even done on board the fatal barges in the upper Cottica, as we could make no &s;moke to drive them away. In this &s;ituation I &s;aw the poor men dig holes with their bayonets in the earth, into which they thru&s;t their heads, &s;topping the entry and covering their necks with their hammocks, while they lay with their bellies on the ground. To &s;leep in any other po&s;ition was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>By the advice of a negro &s;lave, I however enjoyed my re&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Climb," &s;aid he,
"ma&s;&s;era, with your hammock to the top of the highe&s;t tree that is in the camp, and there go &s;leep; not a &s;ingle mu&s;quito will di&s;turb you, the &s;warm will be &s;ufficiently attracted by the &s;mell of
<PB N="91" REF="109">
the &s;weating multitude below."</Q>
&mdash;This I immediately tried, and &s;lept exalted near one hundred feet above my companions, whom I could not &s;ee for the myriads of mu&s;quitoes below me, nor even hear them, from the in|ce&s;&s;ant buzzing of the&s;e trouble&s;ome in&s;ects.</P>
<P>This was the principal di&s;tre&s;s of the night; while, during the day, we had frequently been attacked by whole armies of &s;mall emmets, called here <HI>fire-ants,</HI> from their painful biting. The&s;e in&s;ects are black, and very diminutive, but live in &s;uch amazing multitudes together, that their hillocks have &s;ometimes ob&s;tructed our pa&s;&s;age by their &s;ize, over which, if one chances to pa&s;s, the feet and legs are in&s;tantly covered with innu|merable of the&s;e creatures, which &s;eize the &s;kin with &s;uch violence in their pincers, that they will &s;ooner &s;uffer the head to be parted from their body, than let go their hold. The burning pain which they occa&s;ion cannot, in my opinion, proceed from the &s;harpne&s;s of their pincers only, but mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome venomous fluid which they infu&s;e, or which the wound imbibes from them. I can aver that I have &s;een them make a whole company hop about, as if they had been &s;calded with boiling water.</P>
<P>On the 17th we continued our march &s;till due E. till nine o'clock, when we altered our cour&s;e to the N. and had to &s;cramble through great quantities of tho&s;e mataky roots, or trumpeters already de&s;cribed, which proved that we were de&s;cending into the low grounds, and indeed the &s;oil &s;oon became very mar&s;hy; fortunately, however, though it was now the wet &s;ea&s;on, we had as yet very little rain.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="110">This evening we encamped about four o'clock, Colonel Fourgeoud being &s;eized with a cold fit of the ague.</P>
<P>As I was &s;linging my hammock between two large branches, but not &s;o high as the preceding night, my eye chanced to fall upon what I conceived to be the leaf of a tree, but which appeared to move and crawl up the trunk. I called &s;everal officers to &s;ee it: when a gentleman of the Society exclaimed, "<HI>C'e&s;t la feuille ambulante,</HI>" That is the walking leaf. Upon clo&s;er examination it proved to be an in&s;ect, who&s;e wings &s;o perfectly repre&s;ent a leaf, that by many it has been mi&s;taken for a vegetable production. This &s;eemed to be a &s;pecies of gra&s;shopper, but covered over with four wings of an oval form, and about three inches in length, the two uppermo&s;t &s;o folded together as to appear exactly like a brown leaf, with all the fibres, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I now returned to my hammock; where, reflecting on all the wonders of nature, while the &s;ilver-moon glittering through the verdure added beauty to the &s;cene, I fell into a profound &s;leep, which I enjoyed till near midnight, when we were all awaked in pitch darkne&s;s and a heavy &s;hower of rain, by the hallooing and &s;houting of the rebel negroes, who di&s;charged &s;everal mu&s;kets; but as the &s;hot did not reach our camp, we were extremely a&s;toni&s;hed, the darkne&s;s rendering it impo&s;&s;ible to form any ju&s;t idea of their meaning. This di&s;turbance con|tinuing till near day-break, made us expect every mo|ment to be &s;urrounded, and keep a very &s;harp look-out.</P>
<P>In the morning early we unla&s;hed our hammocks, and
<PB N="93" REF="111">
marched due N. towards the place whence we con|jectured the hallooing noi&s;e to have proceeded, being all much fatigued for want of re&s;t, e&s;pecially Colonel Four|geoud, who could hardly &s;upport him&s;elf, &s;o much was he weakened by the ague. We had not marched above two miles, I having the van-guard, when a <HI>rebel negro</HI> &s;prang up at my feet from under a &s;hrub, where he had been a&s;leep; but as we had orders not to fire upon &s;tragglers, he e&s;caped, running with almo&s;t the &s;wiftne&s;s of a &s;tag among&s;t the brambles. I no &s;ooner made re|port to the old hero, than, &s;wearing he was a &s;py, which I believe was true, he &s;hook off his illne&s;s, and quickened his pace with redoubled vigour: but our pur&s;uit was to no purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t this day; for about one o'clock we got into a bog, from which we could hardly extricate our&s;elves, and were forced to return to our la&s;t night's encampment, mi&s;&s;ing two privates of the Society troops, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed to have peri&s;hed in the mar&s;h.</P>
<P>This day we &s;aw great quantities of arnotta-trees, with which this part of the fore&s;t abounds. In the even|ing a &s;lave pre&s;ented me with a <HI>bu&s;h-&s;pider</HI> of &s;uch magnitude, that putting him into a ca&s;e-bottle above eight inches high, he actually reached the &s;urface with &s;ome of his hideous claws, whil&s;t the others were re&s;t|ing upon the bottom. No creature can be more dread|fully ugly than this enormous &s;pider, which the people of Surinam erroneou&s;ly call the <HI>tarantula.</HI> The body is divided in two, the po&s;terior part oval, and the &s;ize of an Orlean-plum; the fore-part &s;quare, with a figure &s;ome|what
<PB N="94" REF="112">
re&s;embling a &s;tar upon it. This mon&s;ter has five pair of thick legs, with four joints in each; is entirely black or dark brown, and covered over, legs and all, with thick and long black hair, like &s;ome caterpillars, while each leg is armed with a crooked yellow nail, and from the head project two long teeth with inverted pin|cers, re&s;embling the claw of a crab, with which it &s;eizes its prey; while its bite, if not fatal by the venomous li|quid infu&s;ed into the wound, always occa&s;ions a fever. It has eight eyes like mo&s;t &s;piders, and feeds on in&s;ects of every &s;pecies; nay, it is even a&s;&s;erted, that young birds do not e&s;cape it, out of which this &s;pider &s;ucks the blood: its web is &s;mall but very &s;trong. Upon the whole, it is &s;uch a hideous creature, that the very fight of it is &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion a tremor of abhorrence, even in per&s;ons mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to in&s;pect the deformities of nature. Innumerable indeed are the pe&s;ts and dangers to which one is hourly expo&s;ed in the woods of this tropical climate; and though it is my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s only to make mention of &s;uch as I met with in this march, and which mu&s;t appear new to the reader, yet a recapitulation of the names only of our numerous plagues may not be improper to refre&s;h the memory of tho&s;e who have a heart to &s;ympathize with our &s;uffer|ings. I have already mentioned the <HI>mu&s;quitoes, mon|pieras, patat</HI> and <HI>&s;erapat lice, chigoes, cock-roaches, common ants, fire-ants, hor&s;e-flies, wild bees,</HI> and <HI>&s;pi|ders</HI>; be&s;ides the <HI>prickly heat, ring-worm, dry-gripes, putrid fevers, boils, con&s;aca, bloody-flux, thorns, briars,
<PB N="95" REF="113">
alligators, &s;nakes, tigers,</HI> &amp;c.; but I have not yet &s;poken of the <HI>bu&s;h-worms, large ants, locu&s;ts, centipedes, &s;cor|pions, bats,</HI> and <HI>flying-lice,</HI> the <HI>cra&s;&s;y-cra&s;&s;y, yaws, le|thargy, lepro&s;y,</HI> and <HI>drop&s;y,</HI> with a thou&s;and other griev|ances that continually annoyed our unhappy troops; &mdash; a particular de&s;cription of which I mu&s;t delay till a more &s;uitable opportunity occurs for introducing them into this narrative.</P>
<P>Such were the pe&s;ts that we had to &s;truggle with in this baneful climate, whil&s;t our poor men were dying in multitudes, without proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unpitied, and fre|quently without a friend to clo&s;e their eye-lids, neither coffin nor &s;hell to receive their bones, but thrown pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly into one pit, like heaps of loath&s;ome carrion.</P>
<P>On the 19th, we again left our encampment, and after keeping a little S. marched E. till ten o'clock, when we were overtaken and joined by a party of one hundred rangers, with their conductor, Mr. <HI>Vin&s;ack,</HI> to my great &s;atisfaction. At this period we mu&s;tered three hundred men; and however little Colonel Fourgeoud affected, at other times, to value the&s;e black &s;oldiers, he was now not at all di&s;plea&s;ed with their company, upon our near ap|proach to an enemy with whom the rangers were well acquainted, and knew how to engage much better than the marines: while it will ever be my opinion, that one of the&s;e free negroes is preferable to half a dozen white men in the fore&s;t of Guiana; it indeed &s;eems their na|tural element, whil&s;t it is the bane of the Europeans.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="114">Colonel Fourgeoud now i&s;&s;ued orders for our little army to march in three lines or columns, his own re|giment in the centre, the Society troops on the right, the rangers or black &s;oldiers on the left, all within hearing of each other, with a few <HI>flankers</HI> or riflemen out&s;ide the whole: thus formed we advanced till about noon, when we changed our cour&s;e from E. to N. E. and continued our march over a <HI>biree-biree</HI> &s;wamp, or quagmire: the&s;e are very common and dangerous in this country, being a deep &s;oft miry bog, covered over with a thin cru&s;t of verdure, &s;ufficient in mo&s;t places to bear the weight of a man, and quaking when walked over; but &s;hould this cru&s;t give way, whoever breaks it is &s;wallowed up in the cha&s;m, where he mu&s;t inevi|tably peri&s;h if not immediately extricated; thus it has frequently happened that men have been &s;een to &s;ink, and have never more been heard of.</P>
<P>Quick&s;ands are quite different, as they overwhelm by a gradual &s;uction, whereas the effects of a quagmire are in&s;tantaneous. To avoid accidents, we opened our files as much as po&s;&s;ible, which occa&s;ioned a very long rear; but even with this precaution &s;everal men &s;unk through it, as if the ice had broken under their feet, and &s;ome in my pre&s;ence up to the arm-pits, but were fortunately, though with much difficulty, extricated.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we pa&s;&s;ed through two old <HI>ca&s;&s;ava</HI> fields, which indicated our near approach to the rebel &s;ettlement; we afterwards fell in with Captain Meyland's
<PB N="97" REF="115">
path, which we knew by the marks cut upon the trees, as before explained. The evening being too far ad|vanced to attack the enemy, we once more encamped a few miles from the &s;wamp in which Captain Meyland and his party had been defeated.</P>
<P>Having had a long march, and the men being much fatigued, Colonel Fourgeoud allowed, during this night, both huts and fires; which &s;urprized me greatly, being &s;o near the rebels, though he had forbidden the&s;e comforts when we were at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from them. I however availed my&s;elf of his bounty, and having got &s;ome <HI>pigeon-peas</HI> from my &s;erjeant, which he had picked up in the old ca&s;&s;ava grounds, and laid hold of one of the kettles, I invited him, and a captain of the black corps called <HI>Hannibal,</HI> to a &s;hare; who having thrown their &s;alt-beef and ru&s;k-bi&s;cuit into the me&s;s with mine, and &s;tirred it round with a bayonet, we made a very excellent &s;upper, though in a &s;ad dreary night and heavy rain.</P>
<P>The <HI>pigeon</HI> or <HI>Angola</HI> peas grow on a &s;hrub about eight or ten feet high; five or &s;ix of the&s;e peas are con|tained in a pod; they are flat like lentils, and of a reddi&s;h-brown colour: the negroes are extremely fond of them, and cultivate them in their gardens without any expence or much trouble.</P>
<P>Hannibal now ob&s;erving that we &s;hould certainly &s;ee the enemy to-morrow, a&s;ked me if I knew in what man|ner negro engaged again&s;t negro? Having an&s;wered in the negative, he gave me the following relation, while
<PB N="98" REF="116">
&s;moking his pipe under my hammock. &mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ma&s;&s;era," &s;aid he,
"both parties are divided in &s;mall companies of eight or ten men, commanded by a captain, with a horn, &s;uch as this (&s;hewing me his) by which they do every thing, and fight or run away. When they fight they &s;eparate immediately, lie down on the ground, and fire at the fla&s;h of each other's pans through the trees; while each warrior is &s;upported by two negroes un|armed, the one to take his place if he is killed, and the other to carry away the dead body, to prevent its falling into the hands of their adver&s;aries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The negroes have a &s;avage cu&s;tom of mangling and tearing the dead bodies of their enemies; &s;ome even devouring part of them with their teeth, like the Ca|ribbee Indians.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>From this di&s;cour&s;e I perfectly under&s;tood his mean|ing, which I have &s;ince &s;een put in practice; and for the clearer conception of the reader, I have illu&s;trated it with the following plan, where the whole engagement is ex|hibited at one view.</P>
<P>The two columns <HI>E</HI> and <HI>F</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fir&s;t en|gaged, where N^o 1 in the column <HI>E</HI> commences the at|tack by firing at random in the oppo&s;ite bu&s;hes; and in&s;tantly retires, by &s;hifting his place to N^o 1 in the co|lumn <HI>C,</HI> where he re-loads; while N^o 2 in the column <HI>F,</HI> having fired at the fla&s;h of his pan, advances in the &s;ame manner, &s;hifting his &s;tation to re-load at N^o 2 in the column <HI>D</HI>; and at the fla&s;h of who&s;e pan N^o 3 fires in <HI>E,</HI> and receives the fire of N^o 4 in <HI>F,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Thus continuing through both lines, till N^o 8 has fired in <HI>F,</HI>

when the whole have &s;hifted their &s;tations; and the &s;ame manoeuvre is continued with the columns <HI>C</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> beginning again with the identical numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. at the top; while the&s;e lines, having &s;hifted their places, &s;till the firing is repeated by the lines <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B,</HI> and thus <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> until by &s;ounding the horn one of the parties gives way in flight, and the battle is over. I &s;hall only add, that when the fore&s;t is thick, in&s;tead of lying on their bellies, or kneeling, each negro &s;kulks behind a thick tree, which &s;erves him as a bulwark, and from which he fires at his adver&s;ary with more certainty and le&s;s danger, u&s;ually re&s;ting his piece again&s;t the trunk, or in the forked branches, like the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> and <HI>Dela|ware</HI> Indians.</P>
<P>Captain Hannibal al&s;o informed me, that the famous chief <HI>Bonny</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in per&s;on among&s;t the neighbouring rebels; and that he was born in the fore&s;t among&s;t them, notwith&s;tanding his being a mulatto, which was accounted for by his mother e&s;caping to the woods from the ill treatment of her ma&s;ter, by whom &s;he was then pregnant.</P>

again&s;t whom he had frequently fought for the Europeans. Such as <HI>Quammy,</HI> who was the chief of a &s;eparate gang, and had no connection with the others; <HI>Coromantyn, Cojo, Arico,</HI> and <HI>Joli-Coeur</HI>; the two la&s;t being celebrated captains, who&s;e revenge was in&s;atiable again&s;t the whites, particularly <HI>Joli-Coeur</HI>'s, who had I confe&s;s great rea&s;on, as has been already &s;tated.

<P>I now &s;hook hands with Captain Hannibal, while my mind being occupied with the hopes of victory un&s;tained by cruelty, and being very much fatigued, I &s;oon fell profoundly a&s;leep.</P>
<P>On the 20th in the morning, no one could awake in a more beautiful day and better &s;pirits than I did, until they were damped by ob&s;erving that at &s;o critical a time, and even in the moment before the conflict, in&s;tead of that kind treatment which it would have been prudent to have &s;hewn to tho&s;e from who&s;e exertions we were to expect a happy period to our &s;ufferings, there was even then &s;uch di&s;couragement of the &s;ubaltern officers and private men as involuntarily drew from me the reflec|tion &mdash;That (if po&s;&s;ible to avoid it) <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould never inve&s;t any one <HI>individual</HI> with unlimited authority, e&s;pecially in a foreign country, without being perfectly well acquainted with the rectitude of their moral principles and di&s;po&s;ition; no men being fit to command but tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of manly feel|ings, and who&s;e valour is tempered with humanity;

<P>At &s;ix o'clock we advanced N. E. by N. towards the mar&s;h, my melancholy evaporating with the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock we entered this formidable &s;wamp, and &s;oon found our&s;elves above our middle in water, well prepared neverthele&s;s for the warm reception we ex|pected from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, as the former party had &s;o fatally experienced. After wading above half a mile, our grenadiers rapidly mounted the beach with cocked firelocks and bayonets fixed; the main body in&s;tantly followed, and al&s;o mounting the beach, the whole formed without the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition. We now beheld a &s;pec|tacle &s;ufficient to &s;hock the mo&s;t intrepid, the ground &s;trewed with &s;kulls, bones, and ribs &s;till covered with human fle&s;h, and be&s;meared with the blood of tho&s;e unfortunate men who were killed with Captain Meyland. &mdash;That officer had indeed found means to bury them, but the rebels had dug them up for the &s;ake of their cloaths, and to mangle the bodies, which, like ferocious animals, they had torn limb from limb. Among&s;t the&s;e, the fate of <HI>Meyland's nephew,</HI> a promi&s;ing young man, was peculiarly affecting. He came from the mountains of Switzerland in que&s;t of military preferment, and met his fate in a mar&s;h of Surinam ju&s;t after his landing. His bravery was equal to that of his uncle, his intrepidity, voluntarily expo&s;ing him&s;elf to danger, knew no bounds. &mdash;Such is the enthu&s;ia&s;m of military ambition.</P>

<P>This being the &s;econd or third heap of human bones we had met with in our march, I frankly acknowledge did not operate upon me as a &s;timulative to engage with negroes; yet the&s;e awful relics &s;purred on the common &s;oldiers to take revenge for the lo&s;s of their ma&s;&s;acred companions.</P>

<P>In the back-ground may be &s;een the manner in which the &s;laves carry all burdens whatever on the head, and the mode of the rebel negroes firing upon the troops from the tops of high palm-trees, &amp;c.

<P>We now followed a kind of foot-path made by the enemy, which after a little turning led us in a we&s;terly direction.

<P>At ten o'clock we met a &s;mall party of the rebels, with each a green hamper upon his back; they fired at us, dropped their bundles, and taking to their heels ran back towards their village. The&s;e we &s;ince learned were tran&s;porting <HI>rice</HI> to another &s;ettlement for their &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, when they &s;hould be expelled from <HI>Gado-Saby</HI> (the name of this &s;ettlement) which they daily expected, &s;ince they had been di&s;covered by the gallant Captain Meyland. The green hampers, which they call <HI>warimbos,</HI> were very curiou&s;ly plaited with the manicole leaves. And when our men cut them open with their &s;abres, there bur&s;t forth the mo&s;t beautiful clean rice that I ever &s;aw, which was &s;cattered and trampled under foot, as we had no opportunity of carrying it along. A little after this we perceived an empty &s;hed, where a picquet had been &s;tationed to give notice of any danger, but they had precipitately de&s;erted their po&s;t. We now vigorou&s;ly redoubled our pace till about noon; when two more mu&s;|ket &s;hot were fired at us by another advanced guard of the enemy, as a &s;ignal to the chief, <HI>Bonny,</HI> of our ap|proach. Major Medler and my&s;elf, with a few of the
<PB N="106" REF="126">
van-guard, and a &s;mall party of the rangers, at this time ru&s;hing forward, &s;oon came to a fine field of rice and Indian corn: we here made a halt for the other troops, particularly to give time for our rear to clo&s;e up, &s;ome of whom were at lea&s;t two miles behind us; and dur|ing which period we might have been cut to pieces, the enemy, unknown to us, having &s;urrounded the field in which we were, as we were afterwards informed.</P>
<P>In about half an hour the whole body joined us, when we in&s;tantly proceeded by cutting through a &s;mall de|file of the wood, into which we had no &s;ooner entered, than a heavy fire commenced from every &s;ide, the re|bels retiring, and we advancing, until we arrived in the mo&s;t beautiful field of ripe rice, in the form of an ob|long &s;quare, from which the <HI>rebel town</HI> appeared at a di&s;tance, in the form of an amphitheatre, &s;heltered from the &s;un by the foliage of a few lofty trees, the whole pre&s;enting a <HI>coup-d'oeil</HI> romantic and enchanting be|yond conception. In this field the firing was kept up, like one continued peal of thunder, for above forty mi|nutes, during which time our black warriors behaved with wonderful intrepidity and &s;kill. The white &s;ol|diers were too eager, and fired over one another at ran|dom, yet I could perceive a few of them act with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s, and imitate the rangers with great effect; among&s;t the&s;e was <HI>now</HI> the once-daunted Fowler, who being rou&s;ed from his tremor by the firing at the beginning of the on&s;et, had ru&s;hed to the front, and fully
<PB N="107" REF="127">
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed his character, by fighting like a brave fellow, by my &s;ide, until the muzzle of his mu&s;ket was &s;plit by a &s;hot from the enemy, which rendered it u&s;e|le&s;s; a ball pa&s;&s;ed through my &s;hirt, and grazed the &s;kin of my &s;houlder; Mr. Decabanes, my lieutenant, had the &s;ling of his fu&s;ee &s;hot away: &s;everal others were wound|ed, &s;ome mortally, but I did not, to my &s;urprize, ob&s;erve one in&s;tance of <HI>immediate</HI> death&mdash;for which &s;eeming mi|racle, however, I &s;hall pre&s;ently account.</P>
<P>This whole field of rice was &s;urrounded and inter|&s;per&s;ed by the enemy with the large trunks and roots of heavy trees, in order to make our approach both diffi|cult and dangerous; behind the&s;e temporary fortifications the rebels lay lurking, and firing upon us with delibe|rate aim, whil&s;t their <HI>bulwarks</HI> certainly protected them in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the effects of our fire, we hav|ing va&s;t numbers of the&s;e fallen trees to &s;cramble over before we could reach the town: but we &s;till advanced, in defiance of every ob&s;tacle, and while I admired the ma&s;|terly manoeuvres of their general, I could not help pity|ing them for their &s;uper&s;tition. One poor fellow, in particular, tru&s;ting to his <HI>amulet</HI> or charm, fancied him|&s;elf invulnerable; he mounted frequently upon one of the trees that lay near us, di&s;charged his piece, de&s;cended to re-load, and then with equal confidence and the greate&s;t deliberation returned to the charge in my full view; till at la&s;t a &s;hot from one of my marines, named <HI>Valet,</HI> broke the bone of his thigh, and he fell crawling
<PB N="108" REF="128">
for &s;helter under the very &s;ame tree which had &s;upported him ju&s;t before; but the &s;oldier in&s;tantly advancing, and putting the muzzle of his mu&s;ket to the rebel's ear, blew out his brains, while &s;everal of his countrymen, in &s;pite of their &s;pells and charms, &s;hared the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>Being now about to enter the town, a rebel captain, wearing a tarni&s;hed gold-laced hat, and bearing in his hand a torch of flaming &s;traw, &s;eeing their ruin inevita|ble, had the re&s;olution to &s;tay and &s;et the town on fire in our pre&s;ence, which, by the dryne&s;s of the hou&s;es, in|&s;tantly produced a general conflagration, when the firing from the woods began gradually to cea&s;e. This bold and ma&s;terly manoeuvre not only prevented that carnage to which the common &s;oldiers in the heat of victory are but too prone, but al&s;o afforded the enemy an opportunity of retreating with their wives and children, and carrying off their mo&s;t u&s;eful effects; whil&s;t our pur&s;uit, and &s;eizing the &s;poil, were at once fru&s;trated both by the a&s;cending flames, and the unfathomable mar&s;h, which we &s;oon di&s;|covered on all &s;ides to &s;urround us, as in the <HI>Maccabees:</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold the <HI>battle</HI> is before us, and behind us, and the <HI>water of Jordan</HI> on this &s;ide, and that &s;ide, and the <HI>mar&s;h,</HI> and <HI>fore&s;t,</HI> &s;o that there is no place for us to turn a&s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t indeed confe&s;s that within this la&s;t hour the continued noi&s;e of the firing, &s;houting, &s;wearing, and hallooing of black and white men mixed together; the groans of the wounded and the dying, all weltering
<PB N="109" REF="129">
in blood and in du&s;t; the &s;hrill &s;ound of the negro horns from every quarter, and the crackling of the burning village; to which if we add the clouds of &s;moke that every where &s;urrounded us, the a&s;cending flames, &amp;c. &amp;c. formed, on the whole, &s;uch an uncommon &s;cene as I cannot de&s;cribe, and would perhaps not have been unworthy of the pencil of <HI>Hogarth:</HI> this &s;cene I have, however, faintly endeavoured to repre&s;ent in the <HI>fron|ti&s;piece</HI>&mdash; where <HI>I may be &s;een,</HI> after the heat of the ac|tion, fatigued, and dejectedly looking on the body of an unfortunate <HI>rebel negro,</HI> who, with his mu&s;ket in his hand, lies pro&s;trate at my feet.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, having wa&s;hed off the du&s;t, &s;weat, and blood, and having refre&s;hed our&s;elves with a dram and a bit of bread till the flames &s;ub&s;ided, we next went to in&s;pect the &s;moking ruins; and found the above town to have con&s;i&s;ted of about one hundred hou&s;es or huts, &s;ome of which were two &s;tories high. Among the glowing a&s;hes we picked up &s;everal trifles that had e&s;caped the flames, &s;uch as &s;ilver &s;poons and forks, which we &s;uppo&s;ed, by the marks BW. to have been pillaged from the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> e&s;tate in Rio Cottica. We found al&s;o &s;ome knives, broken china and earthen pots; among&s;t the latter one filled with rice and palm-tree worms fell to my &s;hare: as this wanted no fire to dre&s;s the contents, and as my appetite was very keen, I emptied it in a few minutes, and made a very hearty meal. Some were afraid this me&s;s had been left behind with a view to poi&s;on us; but this &s;u&s;pi|cion,
<PB N="110" REF="130">
proved however, fortunately for me, to be without foundation.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver plate I al&s;o purcha&s;ed from the men that picked it up, determined to carry it off as a trophy, and I have u&s;ed it ever &s;ince. Here we likewi&s;e found three &s;kulls fixed upon &s;takes, the mournful relics of &s;ome of our own brave people, who had been formerly killed; but what &s;urprized us mo&s;t, were the heads of two young negroes, which &s;eemed as if fre&s;h cut off, the&s;e we &s;ince learned had been executed during the night of the 17th, when we heard the hallooing and the firing, for &s;peaking in <HI>our</HI> favour.</P>
<P>Having buried all the&s;e remains promi&s;cuou&s;ly in one pit, we returned to &s;ling our hammocks, under tho&s;e beautiful and lofty trees which I have already mention|ed; but here I am &s;orry to add, we found the rangers &s;hockingly employed, in playing at bowls with tho&s;e very heads they had ju&s;t chopped off from their enemies; who, deaf to all remon&s;trance,
<Q><L>"Re&s;i&s;tle&s;s drove the <HI>batter'd &s;kulls</HI> before,</L>
<L>"And da&s;h'd and mangled all the brains with gore."</L></Q></P>
<P>They related that upon reconnoitring the &s;kirts of the &s;urrounding fore&s;t, they had found quantities of human blood in different places, which had flowed from the dead and wounded bodies the rebels had carried away during the action.</P>
<P>To reprimand them for this inhuman diver&s;ion would
<PB N="111" REF="131">
have been u&s;ele&s;s, as they a&s;&s;ured us it was
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Condre fa&s;&s;ee,"</Q>
the cu&s;tom of their country; and con|cluded the horrid &s;port by kicking and mangling the heads, cutting off the lips, cheeks, ears, and no&s;es; they even took out the jaw-bones, which they &s;moke|dried, together with the right hands, to carry home, as trophies of their victory, to their wives and re|lations. That this barbarous cu&s;tom prevails among&s;t &s;avages is a well-known fact, which originates from a motive of in&s;atiable revenge. And though Colonel Fourgeoud might have prevented their inhumanity by his authority, in my opinion he wi&s;ely declined it; ob|&s;erving, that as he could not do it by per&s;ua&s;ion, to do it by power, might break their native &s;pirit, and pro|duce no other effect than alienating them from the &s;er|vice, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary were they to us, though &s;o &s;avagely revengeful, and &s;o bloody.</P>
<P>About three o'clock, whil&s;t we were re&s;ting from our fatigue, we were once more &s;urpri&s;ed by an attack from a party of the enemy; but after exchanging a few &s;hots they were repul&s;ed. This unexpected vi&s;it, however, put us more upon our guard during the night, &s;o that no fires were allowed to be lighted, and double &s;entinels were placed around the camp. Thus &s;ituated, being overcome by exce&s;&s;ive toil and heat, I after &s;un-&s;et leaped into my hammock, and &s;oon fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; but in le&s;s than two hours my faithful black boy Quaco rou&s;ed me, in the mid&s;t of pitch darkne&s;s, crying,
<PB N="112" REF="132">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Ma&s;&s;era, ma&s;&s;era! boo&s;ee negro, boo&s;ee negro!</HI>"&mdash;
"Ma&s;|ter, ma&s;ter! the enemy, the enemy!"</Q>
Hearing, at the &s;ame moment, a bri&s;k firing, with the balls whi&s;tling through the branches, I fully concluded that the re|bels were in the very mid&s;t of our camp. Surpri&s;ed, and not perfectly awake, I &s;uddenly &s;tarted up with my fu&s;ee cocked; and (without knowing where I ran) fir&s;t threw down Quaco, and next fell down my&s;elf, over two or three bodies that lay upon the ground, and which I imagined to be killed. When one of them,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"d&mdash;ning me for a &s;on of a b&mdash;ch, told me, if I moved I was a dead man; Colonel Fourgeoud having i&s;&s;ued orders for the troops to lie flat on their bellies all the night, and not to fire, as mo&s;t of their ammunition had been ex|pended the preceding day."</Q>
I took his advice, and &s;oon di&s;covered him by his voice to be one of our own grena|diers, named <HI>Thom&s;on.</HI> In this &s;ituation we lay pro&s;trate on our arms until &s;un-ri&s;e, during which time a mo&s;t abu|&s;ive dialogue was carried on indeed between the <HI>rebels</HI> and the <HI>rangers,</HI> each party cur&s;ing and menacing the other at a very terrible rate; the former
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"reproaching the rangers as poltroons and traitors to their countrymen, and challenging them next day to &s;ingle combat; &s;wear|ing they only wi&s;hed to lave their hands in the blood of &s;uch &s;coundrels, who had been the principal agents in de&s;troying their flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement."</Q>
The rangers

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">&s;wear|ing they had only de&s;erted their ma&s;ters becau&s;e they were too lazy to work."</Q>
After this they in&s;ulted each other by a kind of war-whoop, &s;ung victorious &s;ongs on both &s;ides, and &s;ounded their horns as &s;ignals of defi|ance; when the firing commenced once more from the rebel negroes, and continued during the night, accom|panied by their martial voices, at intermi&s;&s;ions re&s;ound|ing through the woods, which echo &s;eemed to an&s;wer with redoubled force.</P>
<P>At length poor Fourgeoud took a part in the conver&s;a|tion, my&s;elf and Serjeant Fowler acting as his interpreters, by hallooing, which created more mirth than I had been witne&s;s to for &s;ome time: he promi&s;ed them life, liberty, victuals, drink, and all they wanted. They replied, with a loud laugh, that they wanted nothing from him; charac|teri&s;ed him as a half-&s;tarved Frenchman, who had run away from his own country; and a&s;&s;ured him that if he would venture to pay <HI>them</HI> a vi&s;it, he &s;hould return un|hurt, and not with an empty belly. They told us, that we were to be pitied more than they; that we were <HI>white &s;laves,</HI> hired to be &s;hot at and &s;tarved for four-pence a day; that they &s;corned to expend much more of their powder upon &s;uch &s;carecrows; but &s;hould the planters or over&s;eers dare to enter the woods, not a &s;oul of them &s;hould ever return, any more than the perfidious rangers, &s;ome of whom might depend upon being ma&s;&s;acred that
<PB N="114" REF="134">
day, or the next; and concluded by declaring that <HI>Bonny</HI> &s;hould &s;oon be the governor of the colony.</P>
<P>After this they tinkled their bill-hooks, fired a volley, and gave three cheers; which being an&s;wered by the rangers, the clamour ended, and the rebels di&s;per&s;ed with the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>Our fatigue was great; yet, notwith&s;tanding the length of the conte&s;t, our lo&s;s by the enemies fire was very in|con&s;iderable, for which I promi&s;ed to account; and this my&s;tery was now explained, when the &s;urgeons, dre&s;&s;ing the wounded, extracted very few leaden bullets, but many pebbles, coat-buttons, and pieces of &s;ilver coin, which could do us little mi&s;chief, by penetrating &s;carcely more than &s;kin deep. We al&s;o ob&s;erved, that &s;everal of the poor rebel negroes who were &s;hot, had only the &s;hards of Spa-water cans, in&s;tead of flints, which could &s;eldom do execution; and it was certainly owing to the&s;e circum&s;tances that we came off &s;o well, as I have mentioned before; yet we were neverthele&s;s not without a number of very dan|gerous &s;cars and contu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Inconceivable are the many expedients which the&s;e people employ in the woods, where in a &s;tate of tranquil|lity they &s;eemed, as they boa&s;ted, to want for nothing, being plump and fat, at lea&s;t &s;uch as we had an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving. It &s;hould be noticed, that <HI>game</HI> and <HI>fi&s;h</HI> they catch in great abundance, by artificial traps and &s;prings, and pre&s;erve them by barbacuing; while their
<PB N="115" REF="135">
fields are even over&s;tocked with rice, ca&s;&s;ava, yams, plan|tains, &amp;c. They make <HI>&s;alt</HI> from the palm-tree a&s;hes, as the Gentoos do in the Ea&s;t Indies, or frequently &s;upply the want of it with red pepper.</P>
<P>We here found concealed near the trunk of an old tree a ca&s;e-bottle filled with excellent butter, which the rangers told me they made by melting and clarifying the fat of the palm-tree worms: this fully an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of European butter, and I found it in fact even more deli|cious to my ta&s;te. The <HI>pi&s;tachio</HI> or <HI>pinda</HI> nuts they al&s;o convert into butter, by their oily &s;ub&s;tance, and frequently u&s;e them in their broths. The palm-tree wine they have always in plenty; they procure it by making deep inci&s;ions of a foot &s;quare in the fallen trunk, where the juice being collected, it &s;oon ferments by the heat of the &s;un; it is not only a cool and agreeable beverage, but &s;ufficiently &s;trong to intoxicate. The manicole or pine-tree affords them materials for building; they fabricate pots from clay found near their dwellings; the gourd or calleba&s;&s;e tree procures them cups; the &s;ilk gra&s;s plant and maurecee-tree &s;upplies materials for their hammocks, and even a kind of cap grows naturally upon the palm-trees, as well as brooms; the various kinds of nebee &s;upply the want of ropes; fuel they have for cutting; and a wood called <HI>bee-bee</HI> &s;erves for tinder, by rubbing two pieces on each other; it is al&s;o ela&s;tic, and makes excellent corks; candles they can make, having plenty of fat and oil; and the wild bees afford them wax, as well as excellent honey.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="136">Cloaths they &s;corn to wear, preferring to go naked in a climate where the warmth of the weather renders every kind of covering an u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance.</P>
<P>They might breed hogs and poultry, and keep dogs for hunting and watching them, but this they decline, from the apprehen&s;ion of being di&s;covered by their noi&s;e, as even the crowing of a cock may be heard in the fore&s;t at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance.&mdash;I &s;hall now once more proceed.</P>
<P>The rebels of this &s;ettlement being apparently &s;ubdued and di&s;per&s;ed, Colonel Fourgeoud made it his next bu&s;i|ne&s;s to de&s;troy the &s;urrounding harve&s;t; and I received orders to begin the deva&s;tation, with eighty marines and twenty rangers. Thus I cut down all the rice that was growing plentifully in the two above-mentioned fields; this being done, I di&s;covered a third field &s;outh of the fir&s;t, which I al&s;o demoli&s;hed, and made my report to Fourgeoud, with which he appeared highly &s;atisfied. In the afternoon Captain <HI>Hamel</HI> was detached, with fifty marines and thirty rangers, to reconnoitre behind the vil|lage, and to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, how the rebels could pa&s;s to and fro through an unfathomable mar&s;h, whil&s;t we were unable to pur&s;ue them. This officer at length perceived a kind of floating bridge among&s;t the reeds, made of maurecee-trees, but &s;o con&s;tructed, that only one man abrea&s;t could pa&s;s it. On this were &s;eated a&s;tride a few rebels to defend the communication, who in&s;tantly &s;ired upon the party, but were &s;oon repul&s;ed by the rangers, who &s;hot one of them dead, but he was carried away by his companions.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="137">On the morning of the 22d, our commander ordered a detachment to cro&s;s the bridge and go on di&s;covery, at all hazards. Of this party I led the van. We now took the pa&s;s without oppo&s;ition; and having all marched, or rather &s;crambled over this defile of floating trees, we found our&s;elves in a large oblong field of ca&s;&s;ava and yams, in which were about thirty hou&s;es, <HI>now</HI> de&s;erted, being the remains of the old &s;ettlement called <HI>Cofaay.</HI> In this field we &s;eparated into three divi&s;ions, the better to reconnoitre, one marching north, one north-we&s;t, and the third we&s;t. And here, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, we di&s;|covered that the rea&s;on of the rebels &s;houting, &s;inging, and firing, on the night of the 20th, was not only to cover the retreat of their friends, by cutting off the pa&s;s, but by their unremitting noi&s;e to prevent us from di&s;cover|ing that they were employed, men, women, and children, in preparing warimboes or hampers filled with the fine&s;t rice, yams, and ca&s;&s;ava, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during their e&s;|cape, of which they had only left the chaff and refu&s;e for our contemplation.</P>
<P>This was certainly &s;uch a ma&s;terly trait of general&s;hip in a &s;avage people, whom we affected to de&s;pi&s;e, as would have done honour to any European commander, and has perhaps been &s;eldom equalled by more civilized nations.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXI.</NOTE>COLONEL Fourgeoud, on finding him&s;elf thus foiled by a naked negro, was unable any longer to re&s;train his re&s;entment, and &s;wore aloud he would pur&s;ue Bonny to the world's end. His ammunition and provi&s;ions were however expended, and if they had not, it would have been in vain now to think of overtaking the enemy.&mdash; To the &s;urprize of mo&s;t per&s;ons, our hero however per|&s;evered in this impracticable project, and di&s;patched Cap|tain <HI>Bolts,</HI> with one hundred men and thirty rangers, be&s;ides a number of &s;laves, to tran&s;port a quantity of &s;hot, and a week's provi&s;ions from Barbacoeba, and at the &s;ame time i&s;&s;ued orders for the troops to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon half allowance, de&s;iring the men to &s;upply the deficiency by picking rice, peas, and ca&s;&s;ava, and prepare them in the be&s;t way they could for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and this was al&s;o my lot, as well as mo&s;t of the officers; while it was no bad &s;cene to &s;ee ten or twenty of us with heavy wooden pe&s;|tles, like &s;o many apothecaries, beating the rice in a &s;pe|cies of mortars, cut all along in the hard trunk of a le|velled
<PB N="119" REF="139">
<HI>purper-heart-tree</HI> by the rebel negroes (being the only contrivance u&s;ed by them to &s;eparate the rice from the hu&s;k) this was however for us a mo&s;t laborious bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the &s;weat running down our bodies as if we had been bathing, while water was at this time the only be|verage in the camp.</P>
<P>Among other vegetables we had the good fortune to find here great quantities of <HI>wild pur&s;lane,</HI> which only differs from the common, by growing nearer the ground, the leaves being le&s;s, and more of a blacki&s;h green; this vegetable grows wild in the woods of Guiana, and may be either eaten as a &s;allad, or &s;tewed, without re&s;erve, being not only a cooling and agreeable food, but reck|oned an excellent antidote again&s;t the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>Here were al&s;o great quantities of <HI>gourd</HI> or <HI>caleba&s;&s;e</HI> trees, which are very u&s;eful to the natives of the country. This tree grows to the height of a common apple-tree, with large thick pointed leaves: the gourds it produces are of different forms and dimen&s;ions, &s;ome being oval, &s;ome conical, and &s;ome round, growing often to the &s;ize of ten or twelve inches in diameter; the &s;hell is hard and very &s;mooth, covered over with a &s;hining &s;kin or epidermis, which becomes brown when the gourd is dry and fit for u&s;e: the heart or pulp is a pithy &s;ub&s;tance, which is ea&s;ily extricated by the help of a crooked knife. The u&s;es are various to which the&s;e gourds are applied, they furni&s;h bottles, powder-fla&s;ks, cups, ba&s;ons, and di&s;hes: I &s;eldom travelled without one, which &s;erved me
<PB N="120" REF="140">
as a ba&s;on, plate, &amp;c. in the fore&s;t. The negroes ge|nerally adorn them by carving on the outer &s;kin many fanta&s;tical figures, and filling up the vacancies with chalk-du&s;t, which &s;ometimes has a very pretty effect.</P>
<P>The rangers having been out to reconnoitre, returned on the afternoon of the 23d, and reported that they had di&s;covered and de&s;troyed another field of rice to the N.E. This plea&s;ed Colonel Fourgeoud very well; but when in the du&s;k of the evening I ob&s;erved to him, that I &s;aw &s;everal armed negroes advancing at a di&s;tance, he turned pale, exclaiming, "<HI>Nous &s;ommes perdus!</HI>" and ordered the whole camp immediately under arms. In a few &s;econds the&s;e negroes were near enough to be di&s;cerned, and we now &s;aw that &s;everal of them were carried upon poles, in hammocks. Fourgeoud then &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We &s;till are ruined, though not the enemy: 'tis Captain Bolts, beaten back, with all his party;"</Q>
and this proved literally to be the fact, when that unfortunate officer (having deli|vered the wounded to the &s;urgeons) made his report, that having entered the fatal &s;wamp where Captain Mey|land had been defeated, he was attacked by the enemy from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, who, without hurting a &s;ingle European, had made a dreadful havock among&s;t his <HI>rangers</HI>; that Captain <HI>Valentine,</HI> a brave young fellow, belonging to that corps, whil&s;t &s;ounding his horn to ani|mate his countrymen, had it &s;hot away, with his pouch al&s;o, and was him&s;elf mo&s;t de&s;perately wounded in <HI>five</HI> different parts of the body. In this &s;ituation he was met
<PB N="121" REF="141">
by his brother, named <HI>Captain Avantage,</HI> who, upon &s;eeing his mortal condition, a &s;cene of &s;uch real fra|ternal affection en&s;ued as is &s;eldom to be ob&s;erved in a civilized country:&mdash;kneeling at his &s;ide, and bending over the mangled Valentine, he &s;ucked the blood and gore from his &s;hattered brea&s;t and &s;ides; then cheri&s;h|ed him with the manly promi&s;e to revenge his death upon his foes, and the hopes that when he him|&s;elf was killed he &s;hould meet him again in <HI>a better place.</HI></P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud now found that the rebels had kept their promi&s;e of ma&s;&s;acring the rangers; while Captain Bolts reported that &s;ome had fired upon his party from the tops of the palm-trees, and then &s;liding down with &s;urpri&s;ing agility, di&s;appeared, whil&s;t the rangers were foaming for revenge on their active adver&s;aries, and could hardly be re&s;trained from an immediate pur&s;uit through the verdure.</P>
<P>Our mighty leader now found his ab&s;urd &s;cheme of pur&s;uing the enemy compleatly fru&s;trated, and him&s;elf in danger of total de&s;truction; being cut off from every &s;upply, and having neither ammunition nor provi&s;ions left in his camp, with very few men, except the &s;ick and wounded, to defend it. Thus he at la&s;t began mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider how to &s;ecure a &s;afe retreat; to which he was urged likewi&s;e by the general and ince&s;&s;ant murmurings of the troops, who were not only almo&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="142">
&s;tarved, but indeed dreadfully hara&s;&s;ed by daily fatigues and nightly watchings:
<Q><L>"They wandered in the wilderne&s;s in a &s;olitary way, they found "no city to dwell in.</L>
<L>"Hungry and thir&s;ty, their &s;oul fainted within them."</L></Q></P>
<P>On the 24th, a detachment of one hundred and forty men, commanded by two field officers, were &s;till ordered to de&s;troy the fields, and the old &s;ettlement called <HI>Cofaay</HI>; of this party I had the honour again to be one. We &s;oon performed the &s;ervice we were &s;ent upon, and al&s;o picked, up, out of the mar&s;h, &s;everal uten&s;ils, &s;uch as tea-kettles, iron pots and pans, &amp;c. that the rebels had formerly pillaged from the e&s;tates, and had thrown into the water to conceal them from us, with an in|tention, no doubt, of returning to fi&s;h them up, as &s;oon as we were gone from Gado-Saby.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the detachment in the afternoon, we immediately decamped, and began to retreat for Bar|bacoeba. Here I mu&s;t remark in Colonel Fourgeoud an in&s;tance of <HI>bad policy,</HI> at lea&s;t, though many have not he&s;itated to be&s;tow upon it a har&s;her epithet. This evening, upon our return, when we entered the ominous &s;wamp, he &s;uddenly caught up one of the empty bread-boxes, and having &s;tuffed a hammock into it, he carried it before him as a &s;hield, crying aloud to his men, <Q>"<HI>Sauve qui peut!</HI>"</Q> At this moment a Walloon named <HI>Mattow</HI> &s;tepped up to him, and &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Mon Colonel,</HI> but
<PB N="123" REF="143">
few can, and I hope fewer &s;till will, follow your ex|ample. Drop your &s;hield, and do not intimidate your &s;oldiers: one brave man creates others, then follow thy Mattow, and fear for nothing."</Q>
Upon which he in&s;tantly threw open his bo&s;om, and charging his bay|onet was the fir&s;t that mounted the oppo&s;ite beach: this intrepidity in&s;pired the re&s;t, and they pa&s;&s;ed the mar&s;hy &s;wamp without oppo&s;ition; for which act of heroi&s;m this private marine was &s;ince made a &s;erjeant. I &s;hould think my&s;elf deficient if I did not ob&s;erve, that the Wal|loons in general behaved with great &s;pirit, and were in every re&s;pect excellent &s;oldiers. This evening we en|camped upon the &s;ame ground where we had pa&s;&s;ed the night before the engagement, with exce&s;&s;ive bad weather and very heavy rain.</P>
<P>Early on the morning of the 25th, we again marched, and proceeded on our return, having now a beaten path before us. It will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that we reached our place of general rendezvous, Barbacoeba, on the after|noon of the following day, but in a mo&s;t &s;hocking con|dition; the whole of the detachment being mo&s;tly &s;pent and wore out with fatigue, &s;ome nearly &s;tarved, others mortally wounded; whil&s;t all the &s;laves were em|ployed in carrying the &s;ick and lame in their hammocks, on long poles, though the&s;e poor wretches were &s;carcely able to &s;upport them&s;elves.&mdash;Such was the concluding &s;cene of the taking of Gado-Saby. However, if during this expedition we neither captured any of the rebels,
<PB N="124" REF="144">
nor gained booty, we neverthele&s;s rendered the colony a very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, by rooting out this concealed ne&s;t of enemies, who being thus di&s;covered and driven away from their capital &s;ettlements, never think (as I have already ob&s;erved) of returning to live near the &s;ame &s;pot. I might, indeed, pronounce our victory <HI>almo&s;t</HI> de|ci&s;ive; I &s;ay almo&s;t, for if we except the demoli&s;hing a few plantations for immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and from a &s;pirit of revenge, the rebels were, by being driven from this &s;ettlement, &s;o di&s;concerted and panic-&s;truck, that from the pre&s;ent period their depredations were cer|tainly le&s;s, as they &s;oon afterwards retired to an inacce&s;|&s;ible depth in the fore&s;t, where they neither could do any material injury, nor be joined by negro de&s;erters.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the ma&s;terly manoeuvres of our &s;able foes to more advantage, I here pre&s;ent the reader with a plan of this extraordinary &s;ettlement, together with our different &s;tages, after leaving our encampment on the borders of the Cottica River, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

the mode of arranging them during our encampment in the woods of Guiana, which camps were generally of a triangular form, as being mo&s;t &s;ecure in ca&s;e of a &s;urprize, and the ea&s;ie&s;t to defend our provi&s;ions and ammunition; but the &s;ituation of the ground would not always permit this, and then we encamped in any form, &s;quare, oblong, or circular, &amp;c.&mdash;In the annexed plan,</P>

it could &s;carcely afford daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to his ema|ciated troops on their arrival; who having for many days lived on rice, yams, peas, and Indian corn, were now mo&s;t violently attacked by the flux; for although that kind of nouri&s;hment will keep the Indians and negroes &s;trong as hor&s;es, the Europeans cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without animal food; which was at this time &s;o very &s;carce, that even the Jew &s;oldiers of the Society troops devoured &s;alt pork as fa&s;t as they could catch it.</P>
<P>I neverthele&s;s continued among the few that &s;till were healthy; which was almo&s;t a miracle, as I had fared very hard indeed for want of my private &s;tores, and which, as was mentioned, I had left at the neighbouring e&s;tate <HI>Mocha:</HI> however, expecting leave now to bring them in per&s;on from that plantation, I was in good &s;pi|rits al&s;o. But here I was di&s;appointed, by Colonel Four|geoud's declaring he could not &s;pare me one moment, while I was able to &s;tand upon my feet. I therefore waited patiently for an opportunity of &s;ending for them; in the mean time &s;haring with my black boy the &s;canty allow|ance of a private &s;oldier, with the ca&s;ual addition of &s;ome mountain-cabbage, or palm-tree worms, and perhaps a few warrappa fi&s;h.</P>
<P>As for the mi&s;erable &s;laves, they were &s;o &s;tarved, that having killed a <HI>Coata</HI> monkey, they broiled it, with &s;kin, hair, inte&s;tines and all, then tore it to pieces with their teeth, and devoured it like &s;o many cannibals, before it was even half dre&s;&s;ed. Of this animal they offered me
<PB N="128" REF="150">
a limb; but, hungry as I was, my &s;tomach could not re|li&s;h this kind of veni&s;on.</P>
<P>A good con&s;titution, &s;terling health and &s;pirits, now &s;upported me, or I mu&s;t have &s;unk under the load of mi|&s;ery and hard&s;hips, which were at this time become &s;o intolerable, that the rangers again for&s;ook the camp; and Mr. Vin&s;ack, their conductor, as brave and active a man as ever entered the wood, threw up his commi&s;&s;ion, as Mr. Mongol had done before, during Colonel Four|geoud's fir&s;t campaign at the Wana.</P>
<P>In the beginning of September, the bloody flux raged in the camp to &s;uch a degree, that the colonel &s;aw him|&s;elf obliged to &s;end off all the &s;ick officers and privates, without exception, not to Paramaribo for recovery in the grand ho&s;pital that is there, but to linger and die on the banks of the rivers, where they relieved others to be en|camped, and undergo a &s;imilar wretchedne&s;s; the &s;ick of his own regiment being di&s;patched to Magdenburg in the Tempatee Greek, and tho&s;e of the Society troops to Vreedenberg in Cottica.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud's inhumanity to the officers was now actually become &s;uch, that he would not even permit tho&s;e who were pa&s;t recovery a marine to attend them, what|ever price they offered; &s;ome of whom I have &s;een ex|panded between two trees, while the very filth, for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was dropping through their hammocks. Of this number was En&s;ign <HI>Strows,</HI> who, in this dreadful &s;ituation, was ordered to be tran&s;ported in an open boat
<PB N="129" REF="151">
to Devil's Harwar, where he died. At length Colonel Fourgeoud him&s;elf was &s;eized with this dreadful malady, and his beloved <HI>pti&s;an</HI> proved to be of no more avail; yet he &s;oon recovered, by the plentiful u&s;e of claret and &s;pices, which <HI>he</HI> &s;eldom wanted, and which his colleague Seyburg al&s;o employed as a pre&s;ervative of his health, though by &s;wallowing too copious do&s;es he frequently lo&s;t the u&s;e of his rea&s;on. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, and in &s;uch a de&s;picable encampment, our commander in chief had the vanity to expect a deputation from the court at Para|maribo, with congratulations on his victory: in con&s;e|quence of which he had built an elegant &s;hed, and &s;ent for &s;heep and hogs to entertain them&mdash;but the expected deputies never yet arrived.</P>
<P>On the 5th, therefore, the hogs and &s;heep were &s;laugh|tered, and, for the <HI>fir&s;t time</HI> in his life, he ordered one pound <HI>per</HI> man, bones and all, to be di&s;tributed among the poor emaciated &s;oldiers: indeed the number able to partake of this bounty was at pre&s;ent very &s;mall.</P>
<P>On the following day a reinforcement of one hundred men arrived from Magdenburg, in Comewina; and from the Society po&s;t Vreedenburg, in Cottica, nearly as many. The&s;e confirmed the death of En&s;ign Strows, be&s;ides of a great number of privates, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the tak|ing of <HI>Gado-Saby,</HI> and who had expired in the boats dur|ing their removal from Barbacoeba.</P>
<P>Intelligence arrived at the &s;ame time that the defeated rebels had actually cro&s;&s;ed the river Cottica below Patta|maca,
<PB N="130" REF="152">
intent on immediate mi&s;chief, and that they were marching to the we&s;tward. In con&s;equence of this in|formation, a captain and fifty men were immediately detached, by water, to reconnoitre the banks near the Pinenburg Creek. This party returned upon the 8th, and confirmed the intelligence. Our indefatigable chief now again determined to pur&s;ue them; but the &s;laves who were to carry the ammunition and provi&s;ions had been &s;ent home to their ma&s;ters, nothing but &s;kin and bones, to be exchanged for others, not yet arrived, and to be &s;tarved in their turn. I &s;hall therefore relate what happened the two following days, until the arrival of the&s;e unfortunate <HI>bea&s;ts</HI> of burden; for &s;o they might with propriety be called.</P>
<P>On the 9th were &s;old upon credit, and to the highe&s;t bidder, the effects of the decea&s;ed En&s;ign Strows, when the poor &s;oldiers, regardle&s;s of price, and only wi&s;hing to ob|tain &s;ome cloaths and refre&s;hments to keep (in the vulgar phra&s;e) &s;oul and body together, actually paid at the rate of 700 per cent. and this infamous debt was accordingly &s;tated in their accounts. I have &s;een, for in&s;tance, a pri|vate marine pay five &s;hillings for a pound of mouldered tobacco, that might be worth &s;ix-pence, and double the prime value for a pair of old &s;tockings or &s;hoes. A &s;ick man paid one guinea for a couple of meagre chickens; and for a broken bottle-ca&s;e to hold his lumber, another paid a &s;imilar &s;um. Thus were the&s;e poor dying half-&s;tarved wretches deprived of the little property they
<PB N="131" REF="153">
had earned at the expence of their blood and &s;weat, while this mi&s;erable nece&s;&s;ity might have been ea&s;ily prevented by only &s;upplying them with what was their due. A private marine, of the name of <HI>Sem,</HI> at this time, &s;wore, in the heat of his re&s;entment, that he would certainly &s;hoot Fourgeoud, whenever he had an opportunity; which being overheard, upon condition of repentance, I bribed the evidence not to inform again&s;t him, and &s;o literally &s;aved this poor ra&s;h fellow from dying on the gallows.</P>
<P>Fortunately, all the world did not po&s;&s;e&s;s this chief|tain's in&s;en&s;ibility, for this day the good Mrs. Godefroy once more &s;ent up a flat-bottomed barge, with a fat ox, oranges, and plantains for the private &s;oldiers, which was accordingly di&s;tributed among&s;t them. The &s;ame evening a &s;mall &s;upply of provi&s;ions al&s;o arrived for me, from Joanna, with a few bottles of port wine; and though part was &s;tolen, and part was damaged by the way, it made me very happy, and I gave <HI>nothing</HI> to Fourgeoud.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of provi&s;ions in the woods, we only mean &s;ugar, tea, coffee, Bo&s;ton bi&s;cuit, chee&s;e, rum, ham, or a keg of &s;au&s;ages, &s;ince little el&s;e can be carried through the fore&s;t by a &s;ingle &s;lave, and we were <HI>now</HI> allowed no more. Shirts, &s;hoes, and &s;tockings were al&s;o u&s;ually accounted among the nece&s;&s;aries, but the la&s;t two articles I did not u&s;e, being accu&s;tomed to walk bare-footed, which I had now practi&s;ed for more than two years, and with great advantage to my limbs, when I
<PB N="132" REF="154">
compared them with the di&s;ea&s;ed and ulcerated &s;hanks of my gha&s;tly-looking companions.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the fre&s;h &s;upply of &s;laves being arrived, the nece&s;&s;ary preparations were made to pur&s;ue the rebels the next day, directing our fir&s;t cour&s;e towards the &s;pot formerly called Jeru&s;alem, mentioned in 1773, when I commanded the fatal expedition in Upper Cottica; and on the 13th, the baggage and provi&s;ions being &s;ent before us by water to Jeru&s;alem, e&s;corted by the &s;ick officers and privates, we at la&s;t decamped to follow them, and bidding a final farewell to Barbacoeba, re-entered the woods, marching S. and S. E. the whole day, then pa&s;&s;ed the night on the oppo&s;ite bank of the Ca&s;&s;iporee Creek, where we encamped.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more diabolically cruel, than the per&s;ecution of the new &s;laves during this march; not only overloaded and &s;tarved, but beat like mules or a&s;&s;es by every ill-tempered individual&mdash;for in&s;tance, I &s;aw Fourgeoud's black favourite, Gou&s;ary, knock down a poor negro &s;lave for <HI>not</HI> taking up his load&mdash;and the chief him&s;elf knock him down for taking it up <HI>too &s;oon</HI>; when the wretch, not knowing what to do, exclaimed, in hopes of pity, "<HI>O ma&s;&s;era Je&s;us Chri&s;tus!</HI>" and was actually knocked down a third time by an enthu&s;ia&s;t, for daring to utter a name with which he was &s;o little acquainted.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t day's march, a large drove of <HI>Warre</HI> hogs or wild boars broke through our line; &s;everal of them were cut down by our &s;abres, and &s;tabbed with
<PB N="133" REF="155">
the bayonets, the men having orders from the com|mander in chief not to fire at any game whatever. The animals that were killed were cut in pieces, and di&s;|tributed among the troops, which proved, though &s;mall, a very &s;ea&s;onable dainty. It is certainly very remarkable, that if the fir&s;t wild boar or leader pa&s;&s;es through any danger, all the others &s;tupidly follow, in hopes of a &s;imilar e&s;cape, which on the contrary, as I have &s;aid, fre|quently proves the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>On the 14th we marched S. W. till about noon, and arrived at Jeru&s;alem, which the van had reached about an hour before us, all thoroughly &s;oaked with mud and heavy rains, and &s;everal men unhappily with ruptures in the groin, by falling over the roots of trees, large &s;tones, &amp;c. Here ju&s;t arrived, we found again, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, the identical Mr. <HI>Vin&s;ack,</HI> with one hun|dred fre&s;h rangers: he had heard, it &s;eems, of the rebels pa&s;&s;ing Upper Cottica, and had been prevailed upon to re&s;ume his command by the governor; thus he now once more offered his &s;ervice to Colonel Four|geoud, who was very happy indeed to accept it.</P>
<P>Here, our camp being mo&s;tly overgrown with long coar&s;e gra&s;s, one of the &s;laves was unfortunately bitten in the foot by a &s;mall &s;erpent, called in Surinam the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, I apprehend, is the &s;nake which Dr. Bancroft calls the &s;mall La|bora, and which he mentions as having killed a negro in le&s;s than five minutes when he was at Demerara.</NOTE> <HI>Oroo|cookoo</HI> &s;nake, from its colour, which re&s;embles an owl.
<PB N="134" REF="156">
In le&s;s than a minute the man's leg began to &s;well, when he was &s;eized with excruciating pains, and &s;oon fell into convul&s;ions. One of his companions, having killed the &s;nake, made the patient drink its gall, mixed with half a gla&s;s of &s;pirits, which I gave him. He &s;eemed now (per|haps from imagination) to bear his misfortune better; but the fits &s;oon returned with increa&s;ing violence, and he was in&s;tantly &s;ent to his ma&s;ter's plantation, where he expired. That the gall of adders, <HI>externally</HI> applied, is efficacious, I have often heard. In the Grand Maga|zine for April 1758, may be &s;een a letter, &s;igned J. H. and dated 24th March, which treats &s;y&s;tematically of the application of gall. But the&s;e inve&s;tigations I mu&s;t leave to the learned of the medical profe&s;&s;ion; and only ob|&s;erve, in general, that the &s;maller the &s;nake, at lea&s;t in Guiana, the more fatal the poi&s;on; as is ju&s;tly and beau|tifully ob&s;erved by Thom&s;on:

<P>In this gra&s;&s;y wilderne&s;s one of the rangers al&s;o killed a &s;nake, called the whip-&s;nake, from its re&s;emblance to that in&s;trument; it was about five feet long, and not very much thicker than a &s;wan's quill; the belly white, and the back a lead colour: concerning its bite, I can &s;ay

nothing. I was informed by the negroes, but I cannot &s;peak from my own ob&s;ervation, that it has the power of giving a very &s;evere &s;troke with its tail, like the la&s;h of a whip, which it &s;o much re&s;embles.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o notice an amphibious animal which &s;ome of the negroes killed this evening, called by them the <HI>Cabiai</HI>; it is a &s;pecies of water hog, and about the or|dinary &s;ize of the land animal which goes under that name; it is covered with grey bri&s;tles, and armed with a number of very &s;trong teeth; it has no tail; on each foot it has three toes, webbed like tho&s;e of a duck. This animal, it is &s;aid, goes a&s;hore only during the night, where it feeds on young gra&s;s, and other vegetables. I have been told it is good food, but never ta&s;ted it my&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 16th, having re&s;ted one day at this place, Colonel Fourgeoud detached two &s;trong parties to reconnoitre, <HI>viz.</HI> Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes, with 100 men, was &s;ent to the Wana Greek in Upper Cormoetibo; and Co|lonel Seyburg, with an equal number, was ordered to the Creek Pinenburg, in Upper Cottica. The latter re|turned about midnight with two canoes, which he had found hauled a&s;hore, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, a little below the mouth of the Claas Creek. This con|vinced us that the rebels were gone we&s;tward to plunder, and had brought their empty canoes down the Claas Creek, from the rice country, in order to &s;end them back loaded with booty from the e&s;tates they intended to

pillage. In con&s;equence, therefore, of this information, the proper preparations were immediately made to pur|&s;ue them with alacrity.

<P>ON the morning of the 19th of September 1775,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXII.</NOTE> ju&s;t before &s;un-ri&s;e, Colonel Seyburg marched with one hundred marines and forty rangers, who did me the honour to fix upon me as one of the party, and was upon the whole &s;o polite, and his behaviour &s;o contrary to what it had lately been, that I knew not at all in what manner to account for it.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed the Cormoetibo Creek, we kept cour&s;e S. W. and by S. till we approached the river Cottica, where we encamped, having met with nothing on our fir&s;t day's march worth de&s;cribing, except a &s;pecies of <HI>ants,</HI> which were no le&s;s than one inch in length, and perfectly black. The&s;e in&s;ects pillage a tree of all its leaves in a &s;hort time, which they cut in &s;mall pieces the &s;ize of a &s;ix-pence, and carry under-ground. It was in|deed entertaining to &s;ee a whole army of the&s;e creatures crawling perpetually the &s;ame way, each with his green|leaf in a perpendicular direction. So general is the pro|pen&s;ity to the marvellous, that &s;ome have imagined that
<PB N="138" REF="160">
this deva&s;tation was to feed a blind &s;erpent under ground: but the truth is, that it &s;erves for nouri&s;hment to their young brood, who cannot help them&s;elves, and are &s;ome|times lodged to the depth of eight feet in the earth. Madam Merian &s;ays, they form them&s;elves in chains from one branch to another, while all the others pa&s;s over the&s;e temporary bridges; and that once a year the&s;e for|midable armies travel from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, killing all the vermin, &amp;c. that comes in their way; neither of which facts ever came within the limits of my ob&s;ervation: but that they can bite confoundedly I have found by expe|rience, though their attack is not nearly &s;o painful as the bite of that diminutive in&s;ect the fire-ant already de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The following day we proceeded along the banks of the river Cottica, till we came near the Claas Creek, (where I formerly &s;wam acro&s;s with my &s;abre in my teeth) and early &s;lung our hammocks; from whence I was detached, with a few rangers, to lay in ambu&s;cade in the mouth of the creek till it was dark. Here, however, I di&s;covered nothing, except that the rangers were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;uper&s;tition as the rebels, with regard to their amu|lets or <HI>obias</HI> making them invulnerable. They told me that the latter mentioned procured them from their prie&s;t, and that they them&s;elves bought theirs from <HI>Graman Qwacy,</HI> a celebrated and cunning old negro, whom I &s;hall in a proper place circum&s;tantially de&s;cribe.&mdash;When I a&s;ked them,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How came any of you, or of your invul|nerable
<PB N="139" REF="161">
adver&s;aries, to be &s;hot?"</Q>
I was an&s;wered,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be|cau&s;e, like you, Ma&s;&s;era, they had no faith in the amu|let or <HI>obia.</HI>"</Q>
This piece of policy in Mr. Qwacy, how|ever, had the effect of making all his free countrymen &s;o undauntedly brave, that I mu&s;t confe&s;s their valour had often &s;urprized me. However, this impo&s;ition, as &s;hall be &s;hewn hereafter, be&s;ides re&s;pect and veneration, pro|cured this dealer in magic con&s;iderable both ea&s;e and wealth, which for a black man in Surinam was indeed not very common.</P>
<P>In the mouth of this creek I again &s;aw a quantity of nuts floating on the &s;urface of the water, &s;uch as I have before mentioned, when I was informed that they were the real <HI>acajow</HI> or <HI>ca&s;hew</HI> nuts, which I have partly de|&s;cribed: to which I &s;hall now add, that they grow on the edge of a pulpy &s;ub&s;tance like a very large pear, which is produced on a middle-&s;ized tree, with a grey bark and large thick leaves. This excellent nut will bear to be tran&s;|ported to any part of the globe, and keep good for a con|&s;iderable time; it is by &s;ome called the <HI>Anacardium Occi|dentalis.</HI> From the tree exudes a tran&s;parent gum, which when di&s;&s;olved in water has the con&s;i&s;tency of glue.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ta&s;ted here the <HI>eta-tree apple,</HI> of which the negroes &s;eemed extremely fond. This tree is of the palm kind, with large leaves, but is le&s;s in &s;ize than the maurecee or the mountain cabbage-tree. The fruit or apples are round, and grow in large clu&s;ters re&s;embling grape-&s;hot. In the middle of each apple is a hard nut, in
<PB N="140" REF="162">
which is a kernel, and this is covered near half an inch thick with an orange-coloured pulp, that has a mo&s;t agreeable acid ta&s;te. They are &s;eldom u&s;ed till the apples by ripene&s;s drop from the tree, when the Indians &s;teep them in water, and by maceration convert them into a mo&s;t healthy and agreeable beverage.</P>
<P>An expre&s;s on the 21&s;t arriving by water from Co|lonel Fourgeoud, informing us that the alarm-guns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this meant minute-guns, which are fired on the e&s;tates when in danger. The&s;e, being regularly an&s;wered by the neighbouring plantations, &s;oon alarm the whole river, and bring a&s;&s;i&s;tance from every quarter.</NOTE> had been fired in the river Pirica, we in&s;tantly cro&s;&s;ed to the oppo&s;ite or we&s;t &s;hore of the river Cottica, where the rangers, with a party of marines, were again ordered to lie in ambu&s;cade or under cover, in hopes of cutting off the rebels on their retreat, when they returned to cro&s;s the Cottica river with their booty. And this very after|noon a rebel negro was &s;een with a green hamper, who, &s;tartled by the &s;mell of tobacco (for &s;ome of the rangers were &s;moking) &s;topt &s;hort of his own accord. He was in&s;tantly fired at by me and one ranger: when the wa|rimbo or hamper dropped to the ground, but he him&s;elf e&s;caped. This bundle we found &s;tuffed with a dozen of the fine&s;t table linen, a cocked gold-laced hat, and a cou|ple of &s;uperb India chintz petticoats, &amp;c. the bulk of which I gave to my black companion, re&s;erving only the chintzes for another friend at Paramaribo.</P>
<P>The free negroes now ru&s;hing forwards with unre|&s;trained

valour, I a&s;ked Colonel Seyburg liberty to follow them; and calling for volunteers, a great number pre&s;ented them&s;elves, which, however, the Colonel thought proper to reduce to <HI>four only,</HI> with whom he &s;ent me off; and having &s;crambled through thorns and briars woven to|gether like a net or a mat, which tore one of my thighs in a terrible manner, I overtook them at one mile's di&s;|tance from the camp: &s;hortly after we di&s;covered thirteen fre&s;h huts, where the rebels, we conjectured, had &s;lept but a few nights before. In con&s;equence of this, I now di&s;|patched a ranger back to Colonel Seyburg to give him in|telligence, and a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion for the rangers and my&s;elf to march forward to Pirica without delay, in hopes to meet the enemy: but the an&s;wer was a peremptory order in|&s;tantly to rejoin him with all hands. We now returned di&s;gu&s;ted back to the camp; my &s;able companions in par|ticular extremely di&s;contented, and making many <HI>&s;hrewd</HI> and <HI>&s;arca&s;tic</HI> remarks.</P>
<P>Here we found a reinforcement ju&s;t arrived from Je|ru&s;alem, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty men, black and white, with po&s;itive orders for us to break up and march early the <HI>next</HI> morning for <HI>Pirica</HI> River, while this whole night a &s;trong party lay once more in ambu&s;h.</P>
<P>Accordingly at &s;ix o'clock, with the ri&s;ing-&s;un, all was in readine&s;s, but by &s;ome unaccountable delay it was very late before we left the camp; during which time we were informed that a canoe was &s;een cro&s;&s;ing the river with one &s;ingle negro in it, who was no doubt the poor
<PB N="142" REF="164">
fellow at whom the ranger and I had fired the preceding day.</P>
<P>I cannot here forbear relating a &s;ingular circum&s;tance re&s;pecting my&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> that on waking about four o'clock this morning in my hammock, I was extremely alarmed at finding my&s;elf weltering in congealed blood, and with|out feeling any pain whatever. Having &s;tarted up, and run for the &s;urgeon, with a fire-brand in one hand, and all over be&s;meared with gore; to which if added my pale face, &s;hort hair, and tattered apparel, he might well a&s;k the que&s;tion,
<Q><L>"Be thou a &s;pirit of health or goblin damn'd,</L>
<L>"Bring with thee airs of Heav'n or bla&s;ts from Hell!"</L></Q>
The my&s;tery however was, that I had been bitten by the <HI>vampire</HI> or <HI>&s;pectre</HI> of Guiana, which is al&s;o called the <HI>flying-dog</HI> of New Spain, and by the Spaniards <HI>perro-volador</HI>; this is no other than a bat of a mon&s;trous &s;ize, that &s;ucks the blood from men and cattle when they are fa&s;t a&s;leep, even &s;ometimes till they die; and as the man|ner in which they proceed is truly wonderful, I &s;hall endeavour to give a di&s;tinct account of it.&mdash;Knowing by in&s;tinct that the per&s;on they intend to attack is in a &s;ound &s;lumber, they generally alight near the feet, where while the creature continues fanning with his enormous wings, which keeps one cool, he bites a piece out of the tip of the great toe, &s;o very &s;mall indeed that the head of a pin could &s;carcely be received into the wound, which is con&s;e|quently

not painful; yet through this orifice he conti|nues to &s;uck the blood, until he is obliged to di&s;gorge. He then begins again, and thus continues &s;ucking and di&s;|gorging till he is &s;carcely able to fly, and the &s;ufferer has often been known to &s;leep from time into eternity. Cat|tle they generally bite in the ear, but always in &s;uch places where the blood flows &s;pontaneou&s;ly, perhaps in an artery&mdash;but this is entering rather on the province of the medical faculty. Having applied tobacco-a&s;hes as the be&s;t remedy, and wa&s;hed the gore from my&s;elf and from my hammock, I ob&s;erved &s;everal &s;mall heaps of congealed blood all round the place where I had lain, upon the ground: upon examining which, the &s;urgeon judged that I had lo&s;t at lea&s;t twelve or fourteen ounces during the night.</P>
<P>As I have &s;ince had an opportunity of killing one of the&s;e bats, I cut off his head, which I here pre&s;ent to the reader in its natural &s;ize, and as a great curio&s;ity, with the whole figure flying above it on a &s;maller &s;cale. Hav|ing mea&s;ured this creature, I found it to be between the tips of the wings thirty-two inches and a half; it is &s;aid that &s;ome are above three feet, though nothing like in &s;ize to the bats of Madaga&s;car. The colour was a dark brown, nearly black, but lighter under the belly. Its a&s;pect was truly hideous upon the whole, but particularly the head, which has an erect &s;hining membrane above the no&s;e, terminating in a &s;hrivelled point: the ears are long, rounded, and tran&s;parent: the cutting teeth were four above and &s;ix below. I &s;aw no tail, but a &s;kin, in
<PB N="144" REF="169">
the middle of which was a tendon. It had four toes on each wing, with &s;harp nails divided like the web|foot of a duck <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vol. IV. plate the 83d, by the Count do Buffon, a but is repre&s;ented with only three toes on each wing.</NOTE>; and on the extremity of each pi|nion, where the toes are joined, was a nail or claw to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in crawling, like tho&s;e of its hinder feet, by which it hangs &s;u&s;pended when a&s;leep to trees, rocks, roofs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>One of the marines having this morning taken a <HI>mu|rine</HI> or <HI>mou&s;e oppo&s;&s;um,</HI> I &s;hall al&s;o take the opportunity of de&s;cribing it, and pre&s;ent it to the reader as I de&s;igned it from the life. This animal differs widely in &s;ome par|ticulars from the de&s;cription of the Count <HI>de Buffon:</HI>&mdash; For in&s;tance, it was much &s;wifter than any of the oppo&s;|&s;ums that he &s;peaks of, and had the whole tail covered over with hair in&s;tead of &s;cales, to the be&s;t of my remem|brance; if, however, my &s;ight deceived me, I am not the only erroneous writer on the &s;ubject of this animal. <HI>Linnaeus, Seba,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Vormeer,</HI> with the la&s;t of whom I am acquainted, con&s;ider it as common to both the old and new continent; whereas all its &s;pecies are mo&s;t a&s;&s;ur|edly inhabitants of America only. Linnaeus is al&s;o mi&s;|taken when he a&s;&s;erts, that all bats have four cutting teeth in each jaw.&mdash;<HI>(See Buffon, Vol.</HI> V. <HI>page</HI> 282.)</P>
<P>This murine oppo&s;&s;um was not more than the &s;ize of a very large mou&s;e. It was perfectly black, except the belly, the feet, and the extremity of the tail, which were all buff-coloured, with a buff &s;pot above each eye, which
<PB N="145" REF="170">
re&s;embled tho&s;e of a rat: the ears were long, rounded, and tran&s;parent: its toes were twenty in number, one on each foot being placed behind, and &s;erving as a thumb. It had ten or twelve paps, to which the young ones &s;tick fa&s;t, it is &s;aid, as &s;oon as produced, when they are not larger than &s;mall beetles; but it wanted that pouch which is common to all other oppo&s;&s;ums; in place of this there were two longitudinal folds on the in&s;ide of each thigh, equally adapted to pre&s;erve its offspring from every injury, which no tortures whatever, not even fire, will make it for&s;ake. I have only to add, that it bur|rows in the ground, and often climbs trees; but it feeds like a mou&s;e on grain, fruits, and roots. Of the other &s;pecies I &s;hall defer the de&s;cription till chance affords me an opportunity.</P>
<P>Madam Merion mentions one kind of them, which, in time of danger, carries its young ones upon its back: but this animal, I confe&s;s, I never heard of in Surinam, and am per&s;uaded of its non-exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated that, from &s;ome unaccountable delay, it was very late this morning before we left the camp; we, neverthele&s;s, all &s;tarted at la&s;t; I having the van-guard with the rangers, and the poor marines loaded each man with <HI>nine days</HI> provi&s;ions on his back. In this condition we had not proceeded long, when one of the rangers &s;ounding his horn, they &s;pread, and I among them, all in&s;tantly falling flat upon the ground, with our firelocks cocked, and ready to engage; but this,

however, proving to be a fal&s;e alarm, by a &s;tag ru&s;hing out through the foliage, we &s;oon ro&s;e, and after marching the whole day through water and mire, at three in the afternoon encamped on a high ridge, where not a drop of water was to be found till we had dug a hole for that purpo&s;e, and this was &s;o very thick and muddy, that we were obliged to &s;train it through our neckcloths or &s;hirt|&s;leeves before we could drink it. Here I was once more acco&s;ted by the Lieutenant Colonel, who invited me to &s;ome &s;upper in his hut, and treated me upon the whole with &s;uch very great civility as I could not account for after his former behaviour.</P>
<P>On the &s;ucceeding day we marched again, keeping cour&s;e W. and N. W. with very heavy rain, while I had the rear-guard; and once more entered on a quag|mire, which co&s;t me three hours time to bring up the rear to the beach, this march being particularly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing, as the negro &s;laves, with their burdens, broke through the &s;urface every moment, while the loaded marines had enough to do to mind them&s;elves, and I too weak by my late lo&s;s of blood to afford them any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance whatever. At la&s;t, approaching the beach, I per|ceived the dead bodies of &s;everal rebel negroes &s;cattered on the ground, with their heads and right-hands chopped off. The&s;e bodies being fre&s;h, induced me to conclude, that they mu&s;t have been very lately killed, in &s;ome en|gagement with the troops and rangers &s;tationed on the Pirica river.&mdash;And here I mu&s;t again remark, that had I
<PB N="147" REF="172">
been allowed to pur&s;ue, on the 21&s;t, with the rangers, when I was ordered to march back, the enemy would have been between two fires; in which ca&s;e few could have e&s;caped, and all the plundered &s;poil mu&s;t have been re-taken. The reader will probably recollect a &s;imilar in&s;tance which occurred two years before, when I was &s;tationed at Devil's Harwar. Had I at that time been pro|vided with men and ammunition to march, I might have rendered the colony a material &s;ervice. The&s;e two capital blunders I am &s;orry to relate, but a regard to truth and impartiality obliges me to do it. Let not the&s;e remarks, however, &s;ix a &s;tigma of cruelty on me in the eyes of the world, &s;ince no man could more &s;trongly feel at the &s;ight of &s;uch manly youths &s;tretched dead among the &s;urrounding foliage; and finer bodies than two of them were in particular I never beheld in all my life.</P>
<Q><L>"So two young mountain lions, nurs'd with blood,</L>

<P>While my mind was engaged by the&s;e and &s;imilar remarks, many of my loaded &s;laves &s;till remained en|tangled and &s;truggling in the quagmire, while the com|manding
<PB N="148" REF="173">
officer, with all the other troops, having got on a dry ridge, were quite out of &s;ight and out of hearing, by which &s;eparation the rear-guard not only ran the ha|zard of lo&s;ing all the provi&s;ions and the baggage, but of being cut to pieces, &s;uch was their critical &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Having not a &s;ingle European that had &s;ufficient &s;trength remaining to overtake the party which had proceeded, I re&s;igned the command to my lieutenant, a Mr. <HI>de Lo&s;|rios,</HI> and ventured forward alone through the fore&s;t, till, greatly fatigued, I overtook them; when reporting the &s;ituation of the rear-guard to Colonel Seyburg, I re|que&s;ted
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he would &s;lacken his pace till they were able to extricate them&s;elves and come up from the bog, with|out which I could not be accountable for the con&s;e|quences."</Q>
To this the reply was,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would form his camp when he met with good water;"</Q>
and I in&s;tantly returned to the rear, where having &s;truggled until it was quite dark in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and dangerous &s;ituation, the la&s;t man was dragged out of the mud at &s;even o'clock at night, when we &s;lowly proceeded on till we entered the camp.</P>
<P>My &s;olicitude for the people, powder, and provi&s;ions, in|&s;tead of procuring me commendation from the per&s;on under who&s;e command I then happened to be, and who had lately been &s;o very polite, brought me now into &s;uch difficulties, and produced a mi&s;under&s;tanding of &s;uch a &s;erious nature, and &s;o very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to my feelings, that it had nearly terminated my exi&s;tence. The reader may
<PB N="149" REF="174">
judge of my mortification, when I inform him, that, in|&s;tead of receiving the approbation of my commander, as I certainly de&s;erved, I was immediately on my arrival in camp put under an arre&s;t, to be tried by a court-martial for di&s;obedience of orders. Colonel Seyburg and I had never been on amicable terms; and though, during the former part of this march, he had treated me with appa|rent civility, yet from this &s;tep it was evident that he was my mortal enemy. I mu&s;t not omit, that though a pri|&s;oner (&s;trange to tell!) I was ordered to carry my own arms and accoutrements, till further orders.</P>
<P>On the 24th, we took our departure very early, and di|rected our cour&s;e S. and S. by W. when we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by Pinenburg, a for&s;aken rebel village formerly men|tioned&mdash;I &s;till a pri&s;oner, in the mo&s;t dejected &s;pirits.</P>
<P>On the following, day our cour&s;e was S. W. through a matakey or trumpeter mora&s;s, which was very deep, and which we entered when we were all in a violent &s;weat by advancing too fa&s;t while upon the hard ground: but the health of our men was not made an object during this expedition, though &s;o much wanted to &s;uccced.</P>
<P>Having got again upon a ridge, an accident had now nearly befallen me incomparably greater than all my for|mer misfortunes put together; this was no le&s;s than, hav|ing fallen into a deep reverie, while I followed the rear-guard, I imperceptibly wandered away from the troops, till I was entirely lo&s;t and by my&s;elf in an unbounded wilder|ne&s;s. Quaco no &s;ooner had mi&s;&s;ed me, than, poor fellow, at
<PB N="150" REF="175">
every hazard he ru&s;hed through the wood to recover his ma&s;ter, and by a miracle &s;aw me as I was &s;itting under a tree, in the mo&s;t dejected &s;tate of mind that it is po&s;&s;ible to conceive, immer&s;ed in grief and abandoned to de&s;pair. I had this morning thought my&s;elf perfectly unhappy, but now would have given the world once more to have been in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Good God! entirely cut off from &s;ociety, in a fore&s;t, &s;urrounded by relentle&s;s &s;avages! while a deluge of rain poured from the heavens, and tigers, famine, with every woe and every danger, &s;tared me in the face. Farewell, for ever Joanna!&mdash;Such was the picture of my mind, when on di&s;covering the boy, I &s;tarted up from the ground, and a new life in|&s;tantly diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through my whole frame. Having now &s;traggled backwards and forwards together for &s;ome time, I called to the lad that I &s;aw a pool through which the troops &s;eemed to have pa&s;&s;ed, the water being fre&s;h clouded with mud; but to my utter di&s;appoint|ment, he ob&s;erved, that this puddle was only occa&s;ioned by a Tapira<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By &s;ome called the Hippopotamus of South America, which I will de&s;cribe in a proper place.</NOTE>, and &s;hewed me the print of the animal's foot in the &s;urrounding mire. At this time the boy &s;hed tears, crying, "<HI>Ma&s;&s;era, we deade, we deade!</HI>" In the mid&s;t, however, of this di&s;tre&s;s, recollecting that, by the map, the river Pirica was due we&s;t from us, I determined to lo&s;e no more time, but to &s;et forwards without delay. Thus having fre&s;h primed my fuzee, I ordered Quaco to
<PB N="151" REF="176">
follow me; but again to no purpo&s;e, my compa&s;s being with the troops, and not a glimp&s;e of &s;un&s;hine, owing to the heavy rain; till the black boy put me in mind that on the &s;outh &s;ide the bark of the trees was u&s;ually mo&s;t &s;mooth. This in fact was a fortunate hint, and we pro|ceeded through thick and thin, till, overcome by fatigue and hunger, we both &s;at down, and looked at each other, exactly like two victims doomed to execution. During this la&s;t mournful &s;ilence, we heard a &s;ound like cough|ing and the ru&s;tling of arms, which, thank Heaven! &s;oon proved to be our own troops, luckily for us re&s;ting near an old encampment, where the pur&s;uing party from the river Pirica had lately lodged. At this moment, notwith|&s;tanding my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I enjoyed an extraordinary degree of mental happine&s;s; which proves how much all good and evil are only of a relative nature. Having now been heartily welcomed by the other officers, I partook of &s;ome cold beef and bread, and a gourd full of grog, as did al&s;o my poor boy. After this regale the party ro&s;e, and pur&s;uing our march, we once more entered a quag|mire, or rather a mud-pool, the &s;urface being too thin to carry us; through which having waded till it was pitch dark, we were obliged to encamp in the very middle of it, the troops by &s;linging their hammocks in the trees, one above another, and the &s;laves on temporary rafts made above the &s;urface of the water, on which were al&s;o placed the powder, the victuals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the good Colonel having now drank his
<PB N="152" REF="177">
coffee in his hammock, while he kept the troops &s;tanding round it in water above their middle, a whole hour be|fore day-light, we again &s;crambled forward, keeping our cour&s;e, fir&s;t W. and afterwards N. W. when the road was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively bad, that many &s;laves let fall their burdens, breaking, wetting, and &s;poiling every thing that was in them. At la&s;t, having pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;econd de&s;erted camp, we halted on the old <HI>cordon,</HI> or path of communication on which I formerly di&s;covered the track of the rebels, when I commanded in Cottica river; and here, having erected &s;light &s;heds, we pa&s;&s;ed the night&mdash; I &s;till a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>At this time a &s;mall quadruped running through the camp with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, it was cut down by one of the rangers with his &s;abre. This proved to be the <HI>Paca</HI> or <HI>Spotted Cavey,</HI> called in Surinam the <HI>Aquatic Hare.</HI> This animal is the &s;ize of a &s;ucking pig, and ex|tremely fat. The under jaw is &s;hort, the no&s;trils large, the eyes black, and the ears &s;mall and naked. It has five toes on each foot, a tail like the fir&s;t joint of a man's thumb, and whi&s;kers like a cat; the colour is an earthen brown, with longitudinal rows of buff-coloured &s;pots; the belly is a dirty white, the hair all over coar&s;e and &s;hort. The Paca is an amphibious animal. On land it digs up the earth like a hog in que&s;t of food, and when in danger flies to the water for its &s;afety; notwith&s;tanding this animal is &s;o very plump and heavy, it runs &s;wifter than mo&s;t other animals of its &s;ize in South America, con|trary to the account given of it in the &s;upplement to

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not to be nimble, to run but &s;eldom, and then with a bad grace;"</Q>
which may all be the ca&s;e in a dome&s;tic &s;tate (for the Paca is capable of being tamed) but he is not &s;luggi&s;h in a &s;tate of nature. This I know to be true, having &s;een him run like a hare. We had this animal dre&s;&s;ed for &s;upper, and found him even more delicious than the wood-rat, or even the warra-bo&s;ena: indeed, nothing can be better eating than the Paca or &s;potted Cavy.</P>
<P>The long-no&s;ed <HI>Cavy,</HI> better known by the name of the <HI>Agouti Pacarara,</HI> or <HI>Indian Coney,</HI> is al&s;o very common in Surinam: this is the &s;ize of a large rabbit, its colour is an orange brown, the belly yellow; the legs black and &s;len|der, with four toes on the fore-feet, and three on the hindermo&s;t; the ears &s;mall, the eyes a bright black, the upper lip divided; it has whi&s;kers, and its tail is like that of the Paca. This animal breeds very fa&s;t, and &s;uckles its young, which are three or four in number, in con|cealed holes of old trees, &amp;c. where it al&s;o retires for &s;hel|ter if pur&s;ued; but it does not &s;eek its food in the earth, like the former. The Agouti is ea&s;ily tamed, and feeds on fruits, roots, nuts, &amp;c. But its fle&s;h, though very good, is not &s;o delicious as that of the Paca.</P>
<P>In Surinam I have been told there is &s;till another &s;pecies of the Agouti, called the <HI>Indian Rat-Coney,</HI> on account of its having a long tail. This I never &s;aw, unle&s;s it is the
<PB N="154" REF="180">
&s;ame animal (which I apprehend it to be) that I have de&s;cribed under the name of the bu&s;h-rat.</P>
<P>On the 27th we again broke up, and finally arrived in the forenoon, and in a forlorn condition, at the e&s;tate <HI>Soribo,</HI> on the river Pirica, to defend the plantations again&s;t Bonny and his rebel negroes.</P>
<P>The river <HI>Pirica</HI> by its many windings is thought to extend about three-&s;core miles. It is very deep but nar|row, and has its banks, like all the others, lined with fine coffee and &s;ugar plantations; its general cour&s;e is from S.E. to N. W. We were &s;carcely arrived at this po&s;t, than I was acco&s;ted by &s;everal deputies from Colonel Seyburg, who earne&s;tly intreated that I would only acknowledge my&s;elf to have been in fault, a&s;&s;uring me that I &s;hould then be &s;et at liberty, and all would be forgotten. As I was con&s;cious, however, of my own innocence, I could not in common ju&s;tice criminate my&s;elf in an in&s;tance, where even my alledged crime amounted to no more than an anxious &s;olicitude for the poor men and the provi&s;ions who were entru&s;ted to my care. I was, therefore, placed under the guard of a &s;entinel, for what my commander was plea&s;ed to term unpliant &s;tubbornne&s;s, <HI>and di&s;armed.</HI> In the mean time the marines cau&s;ed me fre&s;h unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and of the mo&s;t poignant kind, by loudly threat|ening to mutiny in my behalf; nor could any thing have prevented them, but my deci&s;ive declaration, that as no cau&s;e could ju&s;tify military di&s;obedience and rebellion, I &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity my&s;elf (however injurious
<PB N="155" REF="181">
to my feelings) of taking an active part again&s;t them, and &s;eeing the ringleaders brought to condign puni&s;hment. I felt that at this time I could war with all the world, and nearly with my&s;elf&mdash;my heart was breaking apace&mdash;my life became a burden:
<Q><L>"Dependants, friends, relations, love him&s;elf,</L>
<L>"<HI>Savag'd by woe,</HI> forget the tender tie,</L>
<L>"The &s;weet engagements of the feeling heart."</L></Q></P>
<P>The day after our arrival in this &s;tation, we received the particulars of the Pirica news, which were, that on the 20th the e&s;tates <HI>Schoonhove</HI> and <HI>Altona</HI> had been pil|laged by the rebels whom we had routed at Gado-Saby, but that at the plantation <HI>Poelwyk</HI> they had been beaten back by the &s;laves: that the rangers &s;tationed at an e&s;tate called <HI>Hagenbos</HI> had pur&s;ued them on the 21&s;t, over|taken them on the 23d, killed &s;everal, and brought back mo&s;t of the booty: that on the &s;ame day another party of the rebels had made an attempt to &s;eize the powder magazine at Hagenbos (which was no bad plan) but that (while the rangers were in pur&s;uit of their a&s;&s;ociates) they had been repul&s;ed by the manly behaviour of a few armed &s;laves, one of whom, belonging to the e&s;tate <HI>Ti|motibo,</HI> took an armed rebel him&s;elf, and next di&s;covered their camp at the back of his ma&s;ter's plantations; for which he was hand&s;omely rewarded. From all which intelligence, there was now no doubt remaining that if Seyburg's detached party on the 16th had marched
<PB N="156" REF="182">
forwards in&s;tead of backwards, by his orders, the above mi&s;chief might have been prevented, and the enterprize of the rebels entirely fru&s;trated. It was al&s;o evident from this narrative, that the man whom we fired at on the 21&s;t was certainly one of the plunderers on the 20th, and that the bodies found dead on the 23d had been &s;hot the very &s;ame day.</P>
<P>On the 29th, among other fruits, &s;ome dates were &s;ent to me by a Society officer. This tree is al&s;o of the Pal|meto &s;pecies, but not extremely high; its leaves diverge from its &s;ummit, very thick, hanging down in the form of an umbrella. The dates appear in large clu&s;ters, being an oblong thin fruit like a man's thumb, of a yellow co|lour, and the pulp, which is fat, firm, and &s;weet, adheres to a hard greyi&s;h-coloured &s;tone, with longitudinal fur|rows.&mdash;I ought not to omit mentioning, that this day &s;ixty rangers going to reconnoitre, di&s;covered the old rebel camp at the back of Timotibo, which &s;eemed to have contained about &s;ixty armed men.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 30th of September, having no|thing more to do in the neighbourhood of the Pirica Ri|ver, we left it, and on the 1&s;t of October came to Devil's Harwar much fatigued, nothing remarkable having hap|pened on our march. I had written on the preceding day to Colonel Fourgeoud, informing him, that I was weary of exi&s;tence in my pre&s;ent &s;tate, and reque&s;ting that a court-martial might be <HI>immediately</HI> called; and this letter I had &s;ent by a &s;lave to the commander in chief.
<PB N="157" REF="183">
On our arrival at this &s;tation, I indeed found every hard means employed to bring me to terms; and &s;uch was the &s;evere u&s;age I experienced, that one of the rangers, called <HI>Captain Quaci,</HI> exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If in this manner the&s;e Eu|ropeans treat one another, is it to be wondered at that they &s;hould take a plea&s;ure in torturing us poor Africans?"</Q></P>
<P>At Devil's Harwar, however, my &s;tormy voyage drew to a conclu&s;ion. Colonel Seyburg was evidently con|vinced that he was wrong, and knowing what mu&s;t fol|low, now only wi&s;hed for a hand&s;ome opportunity of ex|tricating him&s;elf from the effects of his unmanly pa&s;&s;ion. On the 2d of October, therefore, he a&s;ked me with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"If I had a heart to forget and forgive?"</Q> To which I &s;ternly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No!"</Q>&mdash;He repeated the que&s;tion.&mdash; I then &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I venerated truth, and would never confe&s;s my&s;elf in an error, unle&s;s my heart coincided in the acknowledgment&mdash;that this was a conce&s;&s;ion I would make to no man living, and lea&s;t of all to him."</Q>
&mdash;He here gra&s;ped my hand, begged me to be pacified, and declared, <Q REND="inline">"That he would make peace on any terms;"</Q>&mdash; but I again drew back with contempt, and decidedly avowed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I could not agree to any compromi&s;e, un|le&s;s he owned <HI>his fault</HI> in the pre&s;ence of all the offi|cers, with his own hands tearing from his journal every &s;entence that could reflect upon my character."</Q>
The journals were immediately produced, my arms were re|turned me, and my triumph was attended with every
<PB N="158" REF="184">
circum&s;tance that could add to my <HI>full &s;atisfaction.</HI> I then frankly and &s;incerely gave my hand to Colonel Seyburg, who gave a fea&s;t in honour of our reconci|liation; and after dinner, to my utter &s;urprize, pro|duced the <HI>letter</HI> which I had written to Colonel Four|geoud, which he acknowledged he had intercepted to prevent the affair proceeding to extremities: at the &s;ame time he acquainted me, that Fourgeoud was en|camped at the Wana Creek, in&s;tead of Lieutenant Colo|nel de Borgnes, who had fallen &s;ick, and was gone to Pa|ramaribo. A perfect reconciliation having taken place, and every thing being now adju&s;ted, while the troops having had &s;ome re&s;t, we &s;et out once more on the 4th for the head quarters at Jeru&s;alem; but I was obliged to leave poor Quaco, who was very ill, at Devil's Harwar, under care of the &s;urgeon; and that evening we en|camped oppo&s;ite the mouth of the Cormoetibo Creek.</P>
<P>On the following morning early, having cro&s;&s;ed the River Cottica, the troops marched back to Jeru&s;alem; where I now had lei&s;ure to reflect on the various evils which be&s;al poor mortals, as well tho&s;e who are innocent of the difficulties they are brought into, as tho&s;e (which are the greater part) who have brought them&s;elves into di&s;tre&s;s and even de&s;pair by their own indi&s;cretions. The&s;e reflections aro&s;e from finding here, among others, a newly-arrived acquaintance, a Mr. P&mdash;t&mdash;r, who hav|ing &s;quandered away in Europe above <HI>thirty thou&s;and</HI> pounds, and lo&s;t a beautiful wife by elopement, was now
<PB N="159" REF="185">
reduced to the income of an en&s;ign in the Society troops. This gentleman having formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable property in this very colony, his pre&s;ent &s;ituation could not but be a&s;&s;uredly the more galling on that account.&mdash; Alas! unhappy young fellow: well might you exclaim&mdash;
<Q><L>"Priv&eacute; de tout mes biens,</L>

The&s;e are the words which he &s;pouted with a &s;igh, throwing the la&s;t &s;ilver he had left among the &s;laves; and indeed nothing could be more applicable to him&s;elf than the lines he quoted, or more lamentable than this poor devil's forlorn condition; which, however, created in me, during my pre&s;ent humour, no other effect&mdash; than a loud and immoderate fit of laughter.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIII.</NOTE>ON the 9th of October, 1775, Colonel Fourgeoud broke up the encampment at the Wana Creek to join us at Jeru&s;alem, having &s;ent down the half of his party &s;ick in barges; and their number being greatly augmented by the invalids from this place, they were all together tran&s;ported to receive the <HI>coup-de-grace</HI> in the ho&s;pital at Devil's Harwar.

<P>Fourgeoud, during his la&s;t cruize, had di&s;covered a hundred empty hou&s;es, and &s;een &s;ome &s;traggling rebels, but he had taken none.

<P>On the 13th my black boy, Quaco, being perfectly re|covered,
<PB N="161" REF="187">
arrived, to my great &s;atisfaction, as his fidelity to me was &s;o &s;teady and un&s;haken. At the &s;ame time we received an account that Captain Stoelman, with &s;ome rangers, had di&s;covered a fre&s;h &s;ettlement of the rebels by a great &s;moke appearing at a di&s;tance in the fore&s;t, but had not yet attacked them; that Captain Fredericy, with a party of black volunteers, was &s;couring the &s;ea-&s;ide below Paramaribo; that the two men we had lo&s;t on the 18th of Augu&s;t had miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped, and found their way to the po&s;t at the river Marawina; and that no le&s;s than twelve fine negro &s;laves had ju&s;t de&s;erted from the <HI>Gold Mine</HI> e&s;tate to join the rebels.</P>
<P>This news &s;o much exa&s;perated Colonel Fourgeoud, that the indefatigable man again determined to per&s;e|vere in pur&s;uing his enemies. We accordingly entered the woods very early on the morning of the 15th, al|though he and his little army were at this time greatly reduced. He buried but the evening before one of his countrymen, a volunteer, called <HI>Matthew,</HI> and brother to the en&s;ign: but death was now become &s;o familiar to us, that upon lo&s;ing a friend or relation, the fir&s;t que&s;tion generally was,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Has he left any brandy, rum, or to|bacco?"</Q>
&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pauvre Laurant!" &s;aid I, to his &s;hrivelled valet-de-chambre,
"the brave Fourgcoud is like fire; he is to the colony an excellent &s;ervant indeed; but I think to both you and my&s;elf but a roughi&s;h ma&s;ter."</Q>
The poor fellow, &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders, replied, with a grin and a heavy &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Oui, par ma foi!</HI>"</Q> and then treated
<PB N="162" REF="188">
me with a pinch of his &s;nuff. I mu&s;t not omit that, a little before our departure, &s;even more of our negro &s;laves did de&s;ert us, who went home to their ma&s;ters per|fectly broken-hearted, emaciated, and nearly &s;tarved; however, we proceeded, and marched directly N. E. dur|ing which nothing happened, except my box with all my bottles being da&s;hed to pieces; and in the evening we encamped, though <HI>then</HI> unknown to us, near the Ca&s;&s;i|pore Creek, where the dry &s;ea&s;on having commenced, we dug a pit for water. Orders were al&s;o i&s;&s;ued to the troops no more to build huts, &s;heds, &amp;c. as the rains were now le&s;s violent.</P>
<P>On the 16th we continued our route, marching N. E. as before, and towards the evening arrived at the hou&s;es which Colonel Fourgeoud had lately di&s;covered, which proved &s;ince to be only a temporary &s;ettlement, erected by the rebels as a &s;helter or a&s;ylum in their expected retreat, before they were di&s;lodged from Gado-Saby; and to this little &s;ettlement they had given the name of <HI>Boo&s;&s;y Cry,</HI> that is, "the woods lament." Here we encamped, and took much notice of Bonny's hou&s;e in particular, which was built like a watering machine, being elevated from the ground, with two doors, &s;o that he might the better ob&s;erve all around him, and prevent his being taken by &s;urprize; it al&s;o had more air, and, of cour&s;e, was better calculated for his health, he having in &s;ome late action received a very dangerous wound in the groin, as we af|terwards learned from a rebel negro pri&s;oner. Near to
<PB N="163" REF="189">
Bonny's hou&s;e were the private baths, where his women wa&s;hed them&s;elves morning and evening, there being no river near this &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>In this encampment one of our &s;laves pre&s;ented me with a <HI>land-turtle,</HI> which indeed we had met with &s;eve|ral times before; but as I have never de&s;cribed this ani|mal, I will now endeavour to give &s;ome account of it.&mdash; The land-turtle of Surinam is not more than eighteen or twenty inches in length, and of an oval form; the &s;hell is more convex than that of the &s;ea-turtle, and marked with thirteen elevated hexangular &s;hields, dark brown and yellow, &s;o hard that it will bear almo&s;t any weight without breaking; the under &s;hell is a little concave, and of a light yellow: the head of this animal re&s;embles that of other turtles; the tail is naked and &s;hort, but in&s;tead of fins or &s;wimmers it has four feet covered with &s;cales, and armed with &s;harp claws to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in crawling over the ground. When this poor creature &s;ees any danger, it in&s;tantly &s;hrinks within its &s;hell. In this &s;ituation the Indians put it on the fire, where they broil it until it is dre&s;t, which is known by the under &s;hell &s;eparating from the upper, which &s;erves for a di&s;h to hold the contents. A le&s;s barbarous way, and the way which I always fol|lowed, is only to provoke the animal by the heat of the embers to run away; when &s;tretching out its head and neck, they are ea&s;ily chopped off, and the food extracted without additional torture. I have known Mr. de Graaf keep three or four of the&s;e land-turtles for above four
<PB N="164" REF="190">
months for tran&s;portation, during which time they lived without any apparent nouri&s;hment whatever, yet &s;till re|mained vigorous, and even prone to copulation.</P>
<P>Another kind of land-turtle, called here the <HI>arlacacca,</HI> I have often &s;een; this is le&s;s in circumference, very flat, of a di&s;agreeable greeni&s;h colour, and nothing like &s;o good as the former.</P>
<P>On the 17th we continued our march N. and N. E. in hopes of more di&s;coveries, but without &s;ucce&s;s. We this day pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome ant-hillocks above &s;ix feet high, and, without exaggeration, above one hundred feet in circum|ference. We al&s;o &s;aw great quantities of valuable tim|ber, and, among the re&s;t, the <HI>black-cabbage</HI> tree, the wood of which is of a deep brown, and is in high e&s;tima|tion among carpenters and joiners. The <HI>&s;and-hooker</HI> tree was likewi&s;e &s;hewn me, which receives its name from the fruit, which being dive&s;ted of its &s;eed, is u&s;ed as a &s;and-box by writers. It is of the &s;hape of a large onion, with &s;mall holes in the &s;urface; the &s;eed is both laxative and emetic, but the juice of the pulp is a fatal poi&s;on. More than this I cannot &s;ay, having had neither the time nor the power of examining it with the accuracy of a profe&s;&s;ed botani&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 18th we continued the &s;ame cour&s;e for a few hours longer, when we found a beaten path, which, though circuitous, &s;eemed to be a communication be|tween Gado-Saby and Boo&s;&s;y-Cry. We followed this path, which led us due W. for a few hours, when a poor
<PB N="165" REF="191">
rebel negro was found by me covered with branches of the manicole-tree, and indeed barely alive, being in ap|pearance nothing but &s;kin and bone, with one of his eyes almo&s;t beaten out of the &s;ocket. I put my bottle to his mouth, he &s;wallowed a few drops of rum and water, and &s;aid with a faint voice, which we could &s;carcely hear, "Dank ye, me Ma&s;&s;era!" but could articulate nothing more. Fourgeoud ordered this man to be carried with us in a hammock; and we &s;oon afterwards encamped near a biree-biree &s;wamp or quagmire. I ought not to forget that this day we &s;aw &s;ome very fine <HI>locu&s;t-trees,</HI> being eighty or a hundred feet high, and prodigiou&s;ly thick; the trunk is grey and very &s;traight, with no branches till near the top, on which the leaves are di&s;|po&s;ed two to each &s;tem: this is ju&s;tly called the king of the fore&s;t, for a finer tree cannot be found. The tim|ber is of a beautiful cinnamon-colour, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every de&s;ireable quality of gravity, poli&s;h, grain, and durabi|lity.&mdash;But what particularly attracted our notice was its &s;eed, like beans, three or four in number, enclo&s;ed in a broad light-brown pod, that lay &s;cattered in quantities at the root of the tree, upon the ground, and ta&s;ted like &s;ome kinds of gingerbread. From the root of this tree a gum exudes, which, properly prepared, affords a var|ni&s;h hitherto unequalled for tran&s;parency and effect.</P>
<P>Innumerable indeed are the various fine trees that this country produces, and which may be had for the cutting; yet, when we con&s;ider the di&s;tance they u&s;ually grow from navigable rivers, the great labour in felling and
<PB N="166" REF="192">
working them, the va&s;t number of &s;laves required to drag them through the fore&s;t, where no hor&s;es can be employed, be&s;ides the danger and lo&s;s of time, we may ea&s;ily account for the enormous price generally paid for the be&s;t timber in Guiana.</P>
<P>This march undoubtedly afforded us the mo&s;t enchant|ing pro&s;pects that can be imagined, in a luxuriant and ever-green fore&s;t, while the dry &s;ea&s;on contributed greatly to beautify the &s;cene; and &s;imple nature by far out&s;hone the mo&s;t &s;trenuous endeavours of art. Here we met with immen&s;e &s;avannas of the mo&s;t lovely verdure, in|ter&s;per&s;ed with meandring brooks of water, cool and clear as rock cry&s;tal; their borders adorned with flowers of every lively hue and fragrance. In &s;ome places we ob|&s;erved &s;mall clumps of elegant &s;hrubs, or perhaps a &s;in|gle tree, who&s;e beauty would almo&s;t induce one to think they had been de&s;ignedly left growing to enrich the &s;cene. The whole &s;urrounded by a va&s;t wood of lofty palm-trees, waving their &s;ea-green foliage above the va|riegated cop&s;e of never-fading verdure, blo&s;&s;om, and fruit, as if to invite the panting wanderer under its cooling &s;hade, till in the later hours he might enjoy the bracing plea&s;ures of the limpid flood, and contemplate nature's beauties undi&s;turbed.&mdash;When univer&s;al &s;ilence reigned every where around, how often have I thought on my <HI>dear friend,</HI> and wi&s;hed with her to glide through life in the&s;e Ely&s;ian fields!&mdash;But I mu&s;t wave the plea&s;ing recollection.</P>
<P>On the 19th we again marched, and fell in with our
<PB N="167" REF="193">
old path, which we followed, leading directly to the fields of Gado-Saby, where quantities of rice once more ap|peared in full bloom, which we cut down and burned to a&s;hes. Here, perceiving the poor rebel negro hopele&s;s of recovery, not ab&s;olutely to bury him alive, he was over&s;pread with mo&s;s, leaves, and green boughs; after which we &s;lung our hammocks, being almo&s;t choaked with &s;moke.</P>
<P>In the&s;e fields I &s;aw a lizard above two feet long, which the negro &s;laves killed and ate: they called it <HI>&s;apagala,</HI> it was of a browni&s;h green colour, but did not re&s;emble the iguana. Among the ruins of the con&s;umed town we di&s;covered &s;ome <HI>&s;colopendras,</HI> or centipedes, no le&s;s than eight or ten inches in length; this odious reptile is of a yellowi&s;h-brown colour, walks very fa&s;t backwards or forwards, and bites &s;o &s;everely, that the venom it in|fu&s;es, though not deemed fatal, generally produces a fe|ver. Some writers a&s;&s;ign this reptile twenty pair of legs, others forty; I never reckoned them, and can only ob|&s;erve, that they appeared to me exactly to re&s;emble the centipedes in Europe. Some of our gentlemen formed large collections of the&s;e curio&s;ities, which were very va|luable, whil&s;t I contented my&s;elf with the drawings and de&s;criptions only of tho&s;e I thought mo&s;t uncommon.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we marched to vi&s;it <HI>Cofaay,</HI> when I per|ceiving the unhappy negro captive &s;till alive; after re|moving the branches, he was, at my earne&s;t interce&s;&s;ion, once more carried along with us; but the &s;laves, being
<PB N="168" REF="194">
di&s;contented with &s;uch a load, took every opportunity, in my ab&s;ence, of torturing him, by knocking him again&s;t roots and &s;tones, and dragging him through mud and water as they went along. Different patroles were now ordered out to reconnoitre the grounds, while the re|mainder of the troops encamped in the <HI>we&s;t</HI> part of Co|faay; and the&s;e patroles di&s;covered no le&s;s than four beautiful fields in one chain, &s;ituated due we&s;t from Co|faay, well &s;tocked with ca&s;&s;ava, yams, plantains, pi&s;tachio nuts, with maize and pigeon peas: al&s;o were &s;een &s;everal human carca&s;es, the relicts of our late engagements in Augu&s;t. We found here a &s;pecies of <HI>medlars</HI> of a crim|&s;on colour, and of a ta&s;te very much like that of &s;traw|berries. This fruit grows on a large green &s;hrub, and is cultivated in many gardens at Paramaribo. We al&s;o met with a kind of wild plum-tree called <HI>monpe:</HI> the fruit is yellow, oblong, and &s;mall; the &s;tone is large, the pulp thin, and though of a &s;harp acid has an agreeable fla|vour.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 21&s;t, all the&s;e and every u&s;eful vegetable were cut down, and again de&s;troyed by fire; after which, returning to our la&s;t night's camp, we found it al&s;o in flames, and were obliged to &s;ling our hammocks in the <HI>ea&s;t</HI> &s;kirts of the woods. Here, recollecting that the poor di&s;abled rebel was left alone, I ran back <HI>we&s;t</HI> to the burning camp to afford him a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but after &s;eek|ing him in vain through clouds of &s;moke and darkne&s;s, I was forced to con&s;ult my own &s;afety, by ha&s;tily return|ing
<PB N="169" REF="195">
to my companions; &s;ome blaming me much for my te|merity, others damning the <HI>&s;keleton,</HI> whether dead or alive.</P>
<P>The deva&s;tation being now compleated, we marched back to Jeru&s;alem, where on the 24th we arrived per|fectly exhau&s;ted, and Fourgeoud at la&s;t &s;o ill with a phrenzy fever, that he was confined to his hammock, with &s;mall hopes of &s;urviving the night. But he how|ever &s;till continued to command, and the next morning ordered a marine to be ba&s;tonaded, for a&s;king &s;hoes, al|though he was bare-footed, and his feet tore to pieces; while another was flogged for coughing, who had a &s;e|vere cold; a captain was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from actual &s;ervice, and confined in Fort Zealandia, for having dared to marry without his con&s;ent.&mdash;Sickne&s;s and death now raged through the camp, and every thing was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>To compleat the whole, on the 1&s;t of November, twenty-five more negro &s;laves ran away; and on the 3d we received intelligence that no le&s;s than fifty armed rebels had been &s;een &s;wimming acro&s;s the River Cottica, about a mu&s;ket-&s;hot above Barbacoeba.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information, Colonel Seyburg was detached, with the few men that remained able to carry arms, who through di&s;tre&s;s and famine were now almo&s;t ready to attack their own officers; and who being un&s;upplied with their favourite luxury, tobacco <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All &s;ailors, &s;oldiers, and negroes are particularly mi&s;erable without tobacco: it keeps up their &s;pirits, they &s;ay, and &s;ome <HI>almo&s;t</HI> prefer it to bread.</NOTE>, &s;at
<PB N="170" REF="196">
&s;moking grey paper, and chewing leaves and leather as a &s;ub&s;titute for the want of it. Few men, however, were wor&s;e off than I was at this time; &s;ince, having neither provi&s;ions nor cloaths, I was almo&s;t naked as well as &s;tarved, with a running ulcer in my left foot, ever &s;ince the ambu&s;cade and march to Pirica; nor had I a friend in the camp who could give me the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To compleat my mi&s;ery, the little blood I had remaining was in <HI>two</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights again nearly &s;ucked away by the vampire-bat, or &s;pectre: thus I fainted away in my hammock, and was almo&s;t &s;orry to recover, particu|larly upon being informed by a letter that Joanna and her boy were dying with a putrid fever at Paramaribo.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on the 12th, Serjeant Fowler arrived from <HI>Mocha,</HI> with <HI>one</HI> of my boxes; when this poor fellow, notwith|&s;tanding my &s;ituation, made me laugh aloud by producing a letter from his mother in Europe, which made him extremely happy; and which I mu&s;t beg leave <HI>verbatim</HI> to tran&s;cribe.</P>

<P>The &s;ame evening Colonel Seyburg's party returned, without having obtained any further intelligence.</P>
<P>On the 14th Colonel Fourgeoud was &s;o dangerou&s;ly
<PB N="171" REF="197">
ill, that he at length was obliged to relinqui&s;h his com|mand, and proceed to town for his recovery. Accord|ingly on the 15th, he &s;et out by water for Paramaribo: thus, after having &s;acrificed all his troops, he became him&s;elf finally a victim to his unbounded ambition and ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in this wor&s;t of all climates, while by toiling le&s;s and living better both he and his &s;oldiers might have rendered the colony, if not &s;uperior, at lea&s;t an equal &s;ervice.&mdash;A barge loaded with &s;ick and dying was at the &s;ame time once more &s;ent to the ho&s;pital at Devil's Harwar.</P>
<P>The command of the remaining &s;carecrows now de|volved upon the Lieutenant Colonel, who (&s;trange to tell!) that very evening inherited the <HI>&s;ame</HI> di&s;temper, as well as the chief command; the barge that rowed off the old hero having but ju&s;t di&s;appeared, when this gentle|man was attacked al&s;o by the phrenzy fever; the above complaint was indeed at this time very common among&s;t all ranks and degrees who were broiling under a burning &s;un at Jeru&s;alem; it being the dry &s;ea&s;on, when we ought to have been in the woods&mdash;but for tho&s;e expeditions, as I have &s;tated before, the rainy &s;ea&s;ons were mo&s;t unhappily preferred. Several officers would have before now thrown up their military commi&s;&s;ions, could they with decency have taken &s;uch a mea&s;ure, during an expedition on ac|tual &s;ervice; nor, in my opinion, ought &s;uch to be grant|ed, ca&s;es of the very greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity excepted. I could my&s;elf have wi&s;hed to go for &s;ome time to Paramaribo,
<PB N="172" REF="198">
but as this favour was not offered me, while all the others, and even the &s;laves, were relieved, I &s;corned to petition for it while I was able to &s;tand.</P>
<P>On the 19th, however, my foot became &s;o bad, that the &s;urgeon reported me unfit for duty; yet I &s;till remained in the camp, where I could be to none of any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A &s;upply of fre&s;h troops, &s;laves, and provi&s;ions being arrived on the 20th, Major Medlar, with 150 men, was de|tached to make new di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Among other plagues, the whole camp at this time &s;warmed with <HI>locu&s;ts,</HI> which appeared every where in mo&s;t formidable troops, devouring every thing that lay in their way. Indeed the cur&s;e of Heaven &s;eemed to vi&s;it us here in various &s;hapes, and every vermin were &s;o plenty at this time, that no exertion could keep us per|fectly free. The&s;e locu&s;ts were brown, two inches in length, and &s;haped like a gra&s;shopper; they did not fly, but crawled by millions on the very tables and &s;eats as we &s;at at dinner, and at night they tormented us by crawling over our faces by &s;cores.</P>
<P>The only de&s;irable article we found at Jeru&s;alem was fi&s;h, of which we &s;eldom wanted plenty, particularly <HI>new-mara</HI> and <HI>warrappa,</HI> al&s;o the <HI>patakee,</HI> and the <HI>old wifee,</HI> both very excellent; the former of which is about two feet long, &s;haped like a whiting, the other is the &s;ize of a large perch. A kind of needle-fi&s;h, called <HI>naaynaay-fi&s;ee,</HI> was found here in great abundance, the&s;e were very thin, and about one foot in length; al&s;o a kind of
<PB N="173" REF="199">
<HI>dung-fi&s;h,</HI> about the &s;ize of a &s;mall herring, but the&s;e two la&s;t were only u&s;ed by the negroes.</P>
<P>On the 3d of December, Major Medlar's party returned, after fourteen days ab&s;ence, with a captive rebel woman and her boy about eight years old, taken in a &s;mall field of bitter ca&s;&s;ava. The poor woman was pregnant, and under great alarms, but was tenderly treated by Medlar, who was always a humane and well-di&s;po&s;ed gentleman. He had, however, unluckily lo&s;t two of his be&s;t men, one <HI>Schoelar,</HI> a corporal, the other called <HI>Philip Van den Bos,</HI> a private marine, who having inadvertently eaten a few roots of the above <HI>bitter ca&s;&s;ava</HI> were poi&s;oned, and died during the &s;ame night with the mo&s;t excruciating pain and convul&s;ions: the antidote is &s;aid to be Cayenne pep|per and &s;pirits, neither of which were at that time to be procured.</P>
<P>The black woman confirmed the account that Bonny had been wounded; &s;he al&s;o told us the poor &s;tarved ne|gro we had found was called <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and had been left for dead. That one Captain <HI>Arico</HI> had formed a new &s;ettle|ment near the &s;ea, called <HI>Fi&s;&s;y-Hollo</HI>; while Bonny, &s;he a&s;&s;ured us, maintained the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline among&s;t his troops: he was, &s;he &s;aid, ab&s;olutely de&s;potic, and had exe|cuted two of his men but three days before we took Gado-Saby, <HI>viz.</HI> during the night of the 17th Augu&s;t, when we heard the firing and &s;houting, only upon &s;u&s;|picion of having hinted &s;ome few words in favour of the Europeans, and were the heads which we found &s;tuck
<PB N="174" REF="200">
on the &s;takes. She further a&s;&s;ured us, that none of his people were tru&s;ted with arms, until they had fir&s;t &s;erved him &s;ome years as &s;laves, and given him unque&s;|tionable proofs of fidelity and re&s;olution. But the&s;e, &s;he ob&s;erved, were but few in number, when compared to his numerous va&s;&s;als, who were bound to do without murmuring whatever he thought proper to command them; yet that he <HI>&s;till</HI> was more beloved than he was feared, on account of his inflexible ju&s;tice and manly courage.</P>
<P>On the 4th December, this poor woman and her boy were &s;ent to Paramaribo, with En&s;ign <HI>de Cabaines,</HI> who had taken them: he had at the &s;ame time nearly &s;eized a young girl about fifteen, who by her great agility, and being &s;tark naked, &s;lipped out of his hands:
<Q><L>&mdash;"Fugit ocior aur&acirc;</L>
<L>"Illa levi: neque ad haec revocantis verba re&s;i&s;tit:</L>
<L>"Nympha, precor, Peneia, mane: non in&s;equor ho&s;tis.</L>
<L>"Nympha, mane."&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>OVID.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It being proved at the court that the above woman had been forcibly, carried off by the rebels, though many years before, the poor creature was pardoned, and joy|fully returned with her child to her ma&s;ter's plantation. It is remarkable, that when the boy &s;aw the fir&s;t cow or hor&s;e he almo&s;t fell into convul&s;ions with terror; nor could be bear to be touched by any white per&s;on, whom
<PB N="175" REF="201">
he never had &s;een before, and whom he con&s;tantly called <HI>Yorica,</HI> which in his language &s;ignifies the devil.</P>
<P>About this time a dead &s;ea-cow, or <HI>manatee,</HI> by the French called <HI>Lamantin,</HI> floating pa&s;t Jeru&s;alem, the ne|gro &s;laves fell upon it, like &s;o many crows upon a car|rion, &s;wimming round it, &s;ome with a ru&s;ty knife, &s;ome with a bill-hook, and each carrying off a &s;lice for his dinner; at la&s;t they dragged the &s;tinking animal on &s;hore, of which I in&s;tantly took a drawing. This manatee was exactly &s;ixteen feet long, almo&s;t &s;hapele&s;s, being an enor|mous lump of fat, tapering backwards to a fle&s;hy, broad, horizontal tail. It had a thick round head, a flatti&s;h &s;nout, large no&s;trils, with von bri&s;tles both on its no&s;e and chin, &s;mall eyes, and auditory holes in&s;tead of ears. In|&s;tead of feet, it had two excre&s;cences or fle&s;hy fins, like tho&s;e of the &s;ea-turtle, projecting near its head; with the&s;e it &s;wims, and moves awkwardly to eat the gra&s;s on the banks of the rivers, being an amphibious animal. The colour was a greeni&s;h black; the &s;kin was hard and uneven, covered with large knobs, circular wrinkles, and with a very few &s;tiff hairs thinly &s;cattered. It had grinders but no fore-teeth, and a very &s;hort tongue. The &s;ea-cow or manatee is, like the whale, a viviparous animal, the female &s;uckling its young by the help of its &s;wimmers. They are very numerous in the river Ama|zons; their fle&s;h, it is &s;aid, re&s;embles veal, and is very good food. This was, however, too far advanced in a &s;tare of putridity, for me to ta&s;te it. It had the marks of being
<PB N="176" REF="202">
twice &s;hot, which mu&s;t have been by the rebels on the 27th, when we heard the report of two mu&s;kets at a di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>As I am once more on the &s;ubject of natural hi&s;tory, I &s;hall de&s;cribe another amphibious animal, called the <HI>tapira,</HI> which bears &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to the hip|popotamus of the old continent, but it is a great deal le&s;s. This creature is about the &s;ize of a &s;mall a&s;s, but much more clum&s;y. The head is not unlike that of a hor&s;e, but the upper lip much longer, projecting &s;omething like the probo&s;cis of an elephant, and is al&s;o moveable, but too &s;hort to be of u&s;e, as is the trunk of that animal; the ears are &s;hort, the tu&s;ks &s;trong, and &s;ometimes vi|&s;ible, the mane is bri&s;tly and erect, the limbs are low and &s;trong, with a kind of hoof divided into four claws, and the tail is thick and &s;hort, like that of the elephant. The &s;kin of this creature is exce&s;&s;ively thick, of a brown co|lour, and when young it is marked with white &s;pots, like tho&s;e of the &s;tag or paca, proceeding in longitudinal rows. It feeds on gra&s;s, and other herbs that grow in watery places, and is &s;o &s;hy, that when alarmed by the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e it plunges under water, al&s;o like the paca, for &s;e|curity, where it remains for a con&s;iderable time. The fle&s;h of the tapira is delicate, being accounted &s;uperior to the be&s;t ox-beef.&mdash;See both the above animals in the annexed plate.</P>

River Marawina; and Major <HI>Abercromby,</HI> of the &s;ame &s;er|vice, declared, that a <HI>mermaid</HI> was lately &s;een in the Ri|ver Surinam. Lord <HI>Monboddo</HI> al&s;o po&s;itively affirms the exi&s;tence of &s;ea-women and &s;ea-men, while he a&s;&s;erts that they were &s;een &s;o late as 1720. But, however re|&s;pectable his lord&s;hip's judgment and authority may be on other &s;ubjects, I can no more agree with him, as to men and women having fins and &s;cales, than to their having <HI>tails.</HI></P>
<P>The plain fact, in my humble opinion, is this, that in many rivers between the Tropics, both on the coa&s;t of Africa and South America, a fi&s;h &s;ometimes appears half above the water, that bears a di&s;tant re&s;emblance of the human &s;pecies, but is &s;maller, nearly &s;uch as in 1794 was exhibited in London. The colour is of a blacki&s;h green; the head is round, with a deformed kind, of a face; a &s;trong fin runs from near the eyes to the middle of the back, which &s;omething re&s;embles flowing hair: and the two &s;uppo&s;ed arms and hands, are two fle&s;hy fins, or rather digitated &s;wimmers; the female has brea&s;ts a&s;&s;ur|edly like a woman's, being a viviparous animal; while the tail is exactly that of a fi&s;h, in mo&s;t of which proper|ties it agrees with the &s;eal, but this la&s;t has no fin along the back, and is con&s;iderably larger, while it never ap|pears erect above the water, like the former. The above information I had from &s;everal old negroes and Indians, who all agreed perfectly in the de&s;cription; &s;ome added, that they &s;ang, which I apprehend to be no other than a
<PB N="178" REF="207">
grunting noi&s;e which they emit like mo&s;t other tropical fi&s;h and amphibious animals.</P>
<P>They concluded by a&s;&s;uring me, that though they were &s;carce, nothing was more dreaded by their wives and children, than the <HI>Watra Mama,</HI> which &s;ignifies the mother of the waters; and by which name, &s;trange to tell, they di&s;tingui&s;h their <HI>Sybils.</HI>&mdash;So much for the <HI>mon|&s;ters</HI> of the deep; and now I &s;hall once more return to tho&s;e infe&s;ting Terra Firma.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t mentioned, that, on account of a very bad foot, I had been returned unfit for duty by the &s;ur|geon, on the 19th of November; yet this day, Decem|ber 5th, another &s;urgeon, with two captains, and the adjutant, were &s;ent to in&s;pect both <HI>me</HI> and Captain <HI>Perret,</HI> who was al&s;o &s;ick. The &s;urgeon gave his de|claration <HI>upon oath,</HI> that we were incapable of walking without danger, much more of undergoing fatigue; but Seyburg, who was &s;till in his phrenzy fever, declared we &s;hould in&s;tantly enter the woods, though he &s;hould &s;ee us carried in two <HI>wheel-barrows.</HI> Poor Captain Perret complied to turn out, though he looked like a gho&s;t, and could &s;carcely &s;tand; but I &s;olemnly &s;wore that I would blow out the fir&s;t man's brains who dared <HI>di&s;re&s;pectfully</HI> to touch me: in con&s;equence of which I was clo&s;e guard|ed by a &s;entinel; while the whole camp, upon my &s;oul, now &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of none but madmen.</P>
<P>On the 11th we received intelligence that a number of armed rebels had been ju&s;t &s;een oppo&s;ite to Devil's Har|war,
<PB N="179" REF="208">
and afterwards informed they were upon their re|treat from the Comawina River, where on the 5th they had burnt to a&s;hes the dwelling-hou&s;e of the e&s;tate <HI>Kil|le&s;tyn Nova,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Slighter</HI> the over&s;eer <HI>in it,</HI> ran|&s;acked the whole plantation, killed and carried off thirty-three women, and chopped off the limb of a male mulatto child, to be revenged of its father; and that the Pirica rangers were in pur&s;uit of them. Captain Fredericy al&s;o arrived this day, who had exchanged from the Society troops into Colonel Fourgeoud's regiment of marines, and confirmed to us the above unhappy news.</P>
<P>About this time, after having &s;tarved four months, my remaining &s;tores arrived at la&s;t from Mocha, but three-fourths rotted and de&s;troyed by the <HI>blata</HI> or cockroaches: the remaining part I di&s;tributed among the &s;ick people. But what proved truly acceptable, was the cheering account that <HI>Joanna</HI> and <HI>Johnny</HI> were pa&s;t danger, and recovering at Paramaribo. This intelligence indeed &s;o elevated my &s;pirits, that the next morning I reported my&s;elf fit for duty, though God knows that I was not; and to this I was the more induced by the want of fre&s;h air, of which I was perfectly debarred in my confinement, and &s;tood &s;o much in need. The &s;ame evening a boat full of Caribbee Indians rowed up Cormoetibo, for the River Marawina, by the communication of the Wana Creek.</P>
<P>In eight days more, which was the 20th of December, being actually recovered of the wound in my foot, and Seyburg of his phrenetic fever, another officer and I played him the following trick, for his bad u&s;age.
<PB N="180" REF="209">
Having invited this gentleman, with his adjutant, and a few more, to &s;ee us act a farce by candle-light, we af|fected to quarrel, and beating out the candle, the door being well &s;ecured, laid on in the dark with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s upon a certain &s;omebody's &s;houlders, that, calling out Murder! he leaped out at the window. Nothing ever gave me greater entertainment than to perceive his agi|lity; but Colonel Seyburg declared he would never more to <HI>our play</HI> be a &s;pectator.</P>
<P>At this time orders arrived from Colonel Fourgeoud, who was al&s;o better, to break up our camp at Jeru&s;alem, and march once more to the Wana Creek. In con&s;e|quence the &s;ick were again &s;ent down in barges to the ho&s;pital at Devil's Harwar, which was nearly full, while &s;everal were labouring under a di&s;ea&s;e &s;omething like the <HI>tympany,</HI> called here the <HI>kook,</HI> being a prodigious hardne&s;s and &s;welling in the belly, occa&s;ioned, it is &s;aid, by drinking muddy water without &s;pirits, which was in|deed our daily and general beverage.</P>
<P>On the 22d, at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we all de|camped, and &s;crambled up along the banks of the Cormoe|tibo Creek, through a perfect bog, while one poor ne|gro, who had his head fractured, was left behind, and another knocked over-board one of the barges, who was drowned.</P>
<P>We this day again &s;aw great numbers of pingoes or warree-hogs, which as u&s;ual breaking through our line, were cut down by &s;abres and &s;tabbed, while &s;ome ran off with the bayonets &s;ticking in their hams.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="210">This march was peculiarly di&s;agreeable, upon account of the heavy rains, which now began to fall down in torrents, overflowing the banks of all the rivers; and &s;o cold were the damps in the morning, contra&s;ted with the late warm days, that we frequently lay &s;hivering in our hammocks as in fro&s;t, e&s;pecially when &s;leeping in wet cloaths. This inconvenience, however, I obviated to day by marching half naked, like the rangers, and putting my &s;hirt in one of the rever&s;ed kettles, during the rain&mdash; thus my &s;kin &s;oon drying, after a &s;hower, I again put on my linen, and found my&s;elf much more comfortable than any of my trembling gha&s;tly looking companions.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 23d, we encamped near a ri|vulet called the <HI>Caymans</HI> or Alligator Creek; where a tree called <HI>Monbiara</HI> afforded &s;ome excellent fruit, but this was entirely &s;tripped by the &s;laves before I could either ta&s;te or even &s;ee it in perfection.</P>
<P>The rains continuing to pour down in a deluge, I again marched &s;tripped on the 24th, and we &s;lung our hammocks in the evening, near a brook called <HI>Yorica,</HI> or the Devil's Creek, where we made huts or &s;heds to co|ver us, and &s;towed the provi&s;ions upon rafters.</P>
<P>On the following day we once more laboured through deep mud and water, in very heavy rains, and encamped at another &s;mall brook, called the <HI>Java Creek,</HI> three miles below the Wana.</P>
<P>On the 26th I was &s;elected, with a &s;mall party, to re|connoitre the old camps at Wana Creek. In the evening
<PB N="182" REF="211">
we returned, half &s;wimming through mud and water, and having literally &s;een nothing, except &s;ome birds and curious trees, which I cannot pa&s;s unnoticed. The birds were called the <HI>Cromback,</HI> the <HI>Camawarry,</HI> and the <HI>Crocro.</HI> The fir&s;t is a kind of large &s;nipe, the &s;ize of a woodcock, with a crooked bill. The &s;econd is al&s;o a water fowl, but three times as large as the fir&s;t: on ac|count of their &s;wiftne&s;s, and di&s;appearing in a moment, I can give but a very imperfect de&s;cription of them. The <HI>Crocro</HI> is &s;omething le&s;s than our ravens, and I be|lieve of the &s;ame &s;pecies, being one of the mo&s;t voracious birds of the carnivorous tribe; in Guiana it is of a dark blue colour, has a remarkably &s;trong bill and limbs, and croaks exce&s;&s;ively loud and di&s;agreeably, e&s;pecially by night. The trees were what the negroes called the <HI>Ma|takee,</HI> and the <HI>Markoory.</HI> The fir&s;t is remarkable for its roots, which &s;pread above the ground in &s;uch a manner, that they will conceal a &s;core of men from each other; nay &s;o large are they &s;ometimes, that a hor&s;eman may ride through between the inter&s;tices, and one &s;ingle piece is &s;ufficient to make a table large enough to hold twelve people.</P>
<P>For a better idea of this wonderful tree, I refer the reader to the annexed plate; where I have placed it upon the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the encampment at Jeru&s;alem. In the &s;ame plate, he is al&s;o pre&s;ented with a <HI>fair-weather</HI> view of the camp at Java Creek.</P>

on account of its poi&s;onous qualities, which are of &s;uch a &s;ubtle nature, that the very &s;moke of this wood, when on fire, is fatal to tho&s;e animals that receive it into their lungs; this is always &s;een to grow by it&s;elf, as it infal|libly kills every thing around it, nay even the &s;laves re|fu&s;e to cut it down on the plantations, &s;o much are they afraid of touching, or of even coming near to it. The Mar|koory is low, ugly, and uneven, with very few branches, and a pale verdure. I have been told that &s;ome of the Indians render their arrows fatal by dipping the barbs of them in its &s;ap.</P>
<P>On the 27th, another patrole was &s;ent out, but to no better purpo&s;e than the fir&s;t. I have mentioned that my foot was recovered, and &s;o it was, but I had now ex|tracted out of my right arm two dreadful in&s;ects, which left behind them very deep ulcers. The&s;e are called in Surinam the <HI>bu&s;h-worms,</HI> and are the &s;hape and &s;ize of the aurelia of the common butterfly, with a pointed tail and black head.

They breed naturally in &s;tagnated waters, in marching con&s;tantly through which they had attached them&s;elves to my fle&s;h.</P>
<P>My heart now began to &s;ink with accumulated di&s;|a&s;ters; my mind was agitated and depre&s;&s;ed with a con|&s;tant train of tortures, to which I could &s;ee no end, and I became weary of life. In this dreadful &s;ituation I fell upon my naked knees, and invoked the malediction of Heaven to fall on me, if I did not &s;eparate my&s;elf from

<P>The place of our pre&s;ent encampment was now intoler|able beyond every de&s;cription, being con&s;tantly overflowed, &s;o that the ammunition and provi&s;ions were &s;towed for pre|&s;ervation on wooden rafts; nor could we &s;tep out of our hammocks without being up to the knees in mud and water, where it was mo&s;t &s;hallow, while the gnats and other in&s;ects devoured us alive The con&s;equence of all which was, that <HI>another</HI> barge full of dying wretches was &s;ent down the Cormoetibo Creek, bound for the ho&s;pital at Devil's Harwar; among whom the poor old negro with his fractured &s;kull, who, had only ye&s;terday rejoined us in his &s;hocking condition.

<P>TO what good &s;tar I was obliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIV.</NOTE> in the mid&s;t of all our confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, I know not, but certain it is, that Colonel Seyburg having &s;ent for me on the fir&s;t day of the new year, not only &s;olicited my future friend|&s;hip, but declared he was &s;orry for all the ill-treatment he had ever occa&s;ioned me, for which he principally blamed Mr. <HI>Gibhart,</HI> his adjutant and &s;py; then taking me by the hand, as a proof of his real regard, permitted me from that moment to go to Paramaribo, or wherever I plea&s;ed, to refre&s;h and refit until further orders; which had &s;uch an effect on me, that having in&s;tantly converted every drop of my rum into grog, we &s;at down, together with two other officers, and drowned all former animo|&s;ity in oblivion, till we could hardly &s;ee each other. In this condition I took my leave that very evening of my <HI>new</HI> friend and the camp at Java Creek, and rowed down in the be&s;t &s;pirits for Paramaribo.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="218">Next morning, having &s;lept during mo&s;t of the pa&s;|&s;age, I breakfa&s;ted at Devil's Harwar, where I found that the unfortunate Gibhart had ju&s;t &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>other</HI> world.

<P>On the 3d I arrived at the fortre&s;s Am&s;terdam, where I was entertained with an excellent fi&s;h dinner, and where I mu&s;t again intreat the reader's patience, while I attempt to de&s;cribe the different &s;pecies, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>pa&s;&s;ary, prare-prare, provo&s;t,</HI> and <HI>curema.</HI> The pa&s;&s;ary is above two feet long, and weighs &s;ometimes twenty pounds: the head is broad and flat; it has two long barbs, and no &s;cales, and is very delicate eating. The prare-prare is about the &s;ame &s;ize, and equally good. The provo&s;t is large, often five feet, and of a yellowi&s;h colour; the fle&s;h of this is le&s;s agreeable, but the oil it produces comes to good account. As for the curema, this is a &s;pecies of mullet, &s;ometimes above two feet in length, with large &s;ilvery eyes, and the under jaw longer than the upper. Near this place are al&s;o found a kind of <HI>&s;ea-&s;nails,</HI> of which Madam Merian makes mention; and the fore-part of which exactly re&s;embles tho&s;e of a &s;hrimp.</P>
<P>In the evening at &s;ix o'clock I arrived once more at Paramaribo, and found Joanna with her little boy per|fectly

well, after having both been blind for above three weeks; with whom being now invited to lodge, at the hou&s;e of my friend Mr. De Graaf, I was completely happy.</P>
<P>The following day I dined with Colonel Fourgeoud, who now al&s;o was as &s;ound as ever, and who gave me a very indifferent meal of &s;alt provi&s;ions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This he ab&s;olutely held as the be&s;t regimen for health, notwith&s;tanding he had brought three cooks from Europe.</NOTE>, but an <HI>uncom|monly</HI> hearty welcome. He acquainted me that two new companies of free mulattoes, and two of free negroes, all volunteers, had ju&s;t been rai&s;ed; that the Serameca and Owca negroes encouraged and favoured the rebels, and were deceitful ra&s;cals; that a few rebels had been killed in the Ca&s;&s;iwinica Creek; and that he was in hopes of root|ing out <HI>Fi&s;&s;y Hollo</HI>; that <HI>Bonny,</HI> with his people, were almo&s;t &s;tarving in the fore&s;t, notwith&s;tanding their late depredations, which could not la&s;t much longer; and that he was fully determined, if he &s;hould lo&s;e his la&s;t man, to make <HI>this</HI> rebel &s;urrender, or hara&s;s him till he and his gang, through hunger and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould be obliged to quit the colony. I learned further from him, that a Frenchman had ju&s;t e&s;caped hanging for betraying the &s;tate of the fortifications, &amp;c. to the governor of Cay|enne; that he had pardoned Captain Tulling for his clande&s;tine marriage; and that Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes was ju&s;t entered into matrimony with a rich wi|dow, a Mrs. Crawford.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="220">The Colonel, in a word, was now quite the rever&s;e of what he had been before, and upon the whole &s;o very agreeable in his manners, that I would never wi&s;h to &s;pend my time in better company; but how I &s;hould be|come at once the favourite of both the&s;e rival com|manders, was a &s;ecret I could never yet di&s;cover, unle&s;s it might proceed from a de&s;ire of gaining me from each other, as they &s;till continued mutual enemies: be that as it may, I re&s;olved to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t inflexible neutra|lity, as I al&s;o did between them and the governor, where I was invited next day, and dined not on &s;alt-beef, but found as u&s;ual a truly magnificent entertainment.</P>
<P>Thus I continued daily vi&s;iting my friends, <HI>viz.</HI> Mrs. Godefroy, the Demellys, the Gordons, the Mac Neyls, &amp;c. I al&s;o &s;pent a very agreeable day with the black Mrs. Samp&s;on, or Zubly, who was now a widow.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent too at a mulatto ball, compo&s;ed however not of &s;laves, but of free independant &s;ettlers. Here the mu&s;ic, the lights, the country dances, the &s;upper, and, above all, the dre&s;&s;es were &s;o &s;uperb, and their behaviour &s;o decent and genteel, that the whole might &s;erve as a model for decorum and etiquette to &s;ome of the fairer and more poli&s;hed inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the 20th, ob&s;erving a number of Indians and black people of both &s;exes &s;wimming at the back of Fort Ze|landia, young Donald Mac Neyl and my&s;elf compleated the groupe, by &s;tripping and getting in among them; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never beheld more &s;urpri&s;ing feats

<P>Being &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed, we &s;at down upon the beach, near the twenty-one gun battery, where I had an opportunity of examining the features and figure of one of their young females, as &s;he approached us, like Venus ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea.

Nor is the olive-colour incompatible with beauty, it is certainly the &s;tandard complexion of the human race, while the black and white are &s;uppo&s;ed to be only gradations, pro|duced probably by the extremes of heat and cold.

<P><PB N="192" REF="225">As a proof of their gratitude, I will only relate one in|&s;tance: &mdash; Some years ago an Indian woman being at Pa|ramaribo, and far advanced in a &s;tate of pregnancy, a Mr. <HI>Van der Mey</HI> humanely ordered his &s;ervants to con|duct her and her hu&s;band into his hou&s;e, where, giving them a private apartment, and every other conveniency, he wi&s;hed them good-night.

Various were at this time the conjectures concerning the boa&s;ted <HI>integrity</HI> of the <HI>Arrowouka</HI> Indians, until, no le&s;s than eighteen months after, the &s;ame Indian returned to Mr. Van der Mey, with a charming captive boy of the <HI>Accawau</HI> nation, that he had taken in battle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is however extremely uncommon, as a more peaceable people does not exi&s;t in the univer&s;e.</NOTE>; and whom pre&s;enting to his bene|factor, he only &s;aid, "<HI>That's yours,</HI>" and without waiting for any an&s;wer di&s;appeared.&mdash;For this &s;lave the above gentleman was offered. &pound;. 200, which he refu&s;ed, and treated him as well as if he had been free.</P>
<P>The education the&s;e people receive in their infancy being according to the dictates only of &s;imple nature, their minds or their bodies are very &s;eldom deformed, while a too nice attention to either is po&s;&s;ibly as detri|mental as a total neglect. The ingenious Dr. Bancroft is
<PB N="193" REF="226">
of the &s;ame opinion, which he &s;upports (I think need|le&s;sly) by a quotation from Quintilian.</P>
<P>Though the Arrowouka Indians live in perfect friend|&s;hip and harmony with us, and indeed with mo&s;t of their neighbours, they yet &s;ometimes go to war when pro|voked, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved; in the&s;e combats they u&s;e bows and arrows, and the club called <HI>abowtow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The New Zealanders call their clubs <HI>pata-patoo</HI>; which affinity is remarkable, on account of their very great di&s;tance.</NOTE>; but they do not eat their pri&s;oners like the Caribbee In|dians, who even devoured the negroes whom they killed at the in&s;urrection in Berbic&egrave;. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e people live at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;ea than the <HI>Warrows,</HI> &amp;c. yet they have canoes, &s;ometimes four&s;core feet in length, in which they paddle down the rivers, The Arrowouka Indians particularly are great herbali&s;ts, and for all external accidents have recour&s;e to &s;imples, with which the woods of all Terra Firma abound.&mdash; But to proceed:</P>
<P>On the 25th I was &s;eized with a fever, and blooded in the foot, in which the orifice being <HI>&s;truck</HI> too deep, for &s;truck if was as they bleed the hor&s;es, I again became lame; daring which time Colonel Seyburg arrived from the Java Creek to recover, he being at la&s;t al&s;o taken very ill.</P>
<P>In the mean time Colonel Fourgeoud, while he was ju&s;t ready to renew his operations, having already &s;ent a &s;mall detachment to the Jew Savannah for intelligence, received letters from the Hague, with expre&s;s orders to
<PB N="194" REF="227">
abandon the expedition immediately, and with his few remaining troops to &s;ail for Holland without delay.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e commands on the 27th, the tran&s;port &s;hips were put in commi&s;&s;ion, and all the officers and privates received their clearance, which made them very happy; and indeed all at Paramaribo were alive with joy, except &s;ome of the inhabitants and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 14th of February, ill as I was with a bad foot, a &s;ore arm, the prickly heat, and all my teeth loo&s;e with the &s;curvy, I found means to &s;cramble out on crutches, with a thou&s;and florins in my pocket, which having di|vided between Fourgeoud and Mrs. Godefroy for the redemption of the black boy <HI>Quaco,</HI> and my <HI>mulatto,</HI> I returned borne without a &s;hilling in my pur&s;e; yet for this &s;mall &s;um of 500 florins, &s;o inadequate to 1800 which I owed that lady, &s;he was induced generou&s;ly to renew her per&s;ua&s;ions of carrying Joanna and the boy with me to Holland. This, however, Joanna as nobly as firmly refu&s;ed, declaring,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, independant of all other con&s;i|derations, &s;he could never think of &s;acrificing one be|nefactor to the intere&s;t of another; and that her own happine&s;s or even mine, which was dearer to her than life, &s;hould never have any weight, till the debt of her liberty was paid by me, or by her own indu&s;try, to the utmo&s;t fraction, and which &s;he did not de&s;pair to &s;ee one day compleated."</Q>
She added,

which la&s;t &s;he &s;poke with a &s;mile, next embraced her infant, then turned &s;uddenly round, and wept mo&s;t bitterly.&mdash;At this moment I was called to Mr. <HI>de la Mare</HI>'s, who was ju&s;t dead, where my melancholy having &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all de&s;crip|tion, I at la&s;t determined to weather one or two painful years in her ab&s;ence; and in the afternoon went to di&s;&s;i|pate my mind at a Mr. <HI>Roux</HI>'s cabinet of Indian curio&s;i|ties; where, as my eye chanced to fall on a rattle-&s;nake, I will before I leave the colony de&s;cribe this dangerous reptile.</P>
<P>The <HI>rattle-&s;nake</HI> of Surinam is &s;ometimes eight or nine feet long, and very thick about the middle, tapering towards the neck and tail. The head is dreadfully de|formed, being flat and broad, with two large no&s;trils near the &s;nout, and a large &s;cale or knob like the alligator above his eyes, which are jet-black and &s;parkling; at the extremity of the tail are &s;everal thin horny, &s;hells joined together, which are very dry, and which, when irritated, the animal &s;hakes, &s;ounding much like a <HI>rattle,</HI> from which it derives its name. The&s;e &s;hells augment, <HI>it is &s;aid,</HI> in the proportion of one every year, by which it is &s;uppo&s;ed its age may be a&s;certained. This whole &s;nake is covered over with &s;cales, which on the ridge of the back it crects. The colour is a dirty orange mixed with dark-brown and black &s;pots, which la&s;t are al&s;o on its head, appearing like velvet, and marked in a very con&s;pi|cuous manner; the belly is a&s;h-coloured, with tran&s;ver&s;e
<PB N="196" REF="229">
&s;cales like mo&s;t other &s;erpents. When this animal is in|tent on mi&s;chief, it lies coiled like a rope, with the tail a little in motion, which having rattled, it launches forth upon its prey, making no farther reach than its own length; this done, it coils a &s;econd time, and again pro|jects it&s;elf. The bite of the rattle-&s;nake is accounted fatal, at lea&s;t is thought very dangerous over all America; but with regard to the fa&s;cinating qualities of its eyes, &s;uch as the &s;tory of its cau&s;ing mice, &s;quirrels, and birds to run into its mouth, I reject them as fables; the &s;uppo&s;ed charm con&s;i&s;ting in nothing more than this, that the poor animals, finding them&s;elves &s;urprized by the im|pending danger, are &s;eized with &s;uch a trepidation and fear, that even the u&s;e of their limbs for&s;akes them, and they are rivetted to the place till they die, or in the act of leaping they are &s;eized by their enemy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a letter to the editors of the New Univer&s;al Magazine for October 1787.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this cabinet I al&s;o &s;aw the <HI>blue dip&s;as</HI> of Surinam, which had almo&s;t the colour of ultramarine on the back; its &s;ides were lighter, and the belly nearly white. I did not learn that the bite of this reptile was fatal, but that it occa&s;ions immoderate thir&s;t in the patient, from which it took its name; the word <HI>dip&s;a</HI> &s;ignifying thir&s;t in the Greek language. Another &s;nake I al&s;o ob&s;erved here, about three feet long, being annulated with different colours, and called <HI>amphi&s;boena,</HI> from the &s;uppo&s;ition of its hav|ing two heads; but the truth is, that from its cylindrical

form the head and tail &s;o much re&s;emble each other, that the error is almo&s;t pardonable; be&s;ides which, the eyes are nearly imperceptible. This is the &s;nake which, be|ing &s;uppo&s;ed blind, and vulgarly &s;aid to be fed by the large ants already de&s;cribed, is in this country honoured with the name of King of the Emmets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How Madam Merian &s;hould call this reptile an <HI>oviparous viper,</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;es my comprehen&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among&s;t Mr. Roux's numerous collection of fine but|terflies, one of a middle &s;ize I thought peculiarly beau|tiful; all its wings, both above and below, being elegantly &s;treaked with tran&s;ver&s;e bars of velvet, black, and a va|riegated bright green. The amazing height to which they a&s;cend, and the great velocity with which the&s;e in|&s;ects fly, make them &s;o rare, being, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, but very &s;eldom caught. The caterpillar is a &s;ea-green, and all covered over with hard feelers, not unlike fea|thers.&mdash;For a better idea of the above &s;nakes, and this fly, &s;ee the plate annexed, where the la&s;t was improved from Madam Merian's collection.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t &s;aid that we were ordered to leave the co|lony, and that all were overjoyed with the news, my&s;elf excepted. But on the 15th, by letters from Holland to our chief, our <HI>return</HI> was again countermanded for &s;ix months. My companions were therefore &s;uddenly ca&s;t down with di&s;appointment, while I was as &s;uddenly re|vived, and now determined to &s;ave all my pay until Jo|anna's redemption &s;hould be fully accompli&s;hed: but what
<PB N="198" REF="232">
grieved me very much was the other news from Europe, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Scots Brigade</HI> had been invited to England by his Britannic Maje&s;ty, while I was lamenting that I could not po&s;&s;ibly be one of the number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King's demand was negatived by the States of Holland.</NOTE>. I at the &s;ame time had the offer of an American company under Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, but this I refu&s;ed without any he&s;ita|tion, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, on the 18th of February, the poor di&s;pirited men were again &s;ent up to Magdenburg, a large party &s;till remaining at the Java Creek; whil&s;t the temper of the officers was now &s;o ruffled, that a Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> of our corps fought no le&s;s than <HI>two</HI> duels in two &s;ucceeding days, dangerou&s;ly wounding both his antagoni&s;ts, who were both officers of the Society regiment.</P>
<P>As I was not yet recovered, I &s;taid &s;ome time longer at Paramaribo, where at the hou&s;e of a Mr. Reyn&s;dorp, I &s;aw a Portugue&s;e <HI>Jew</HI> teaching his children the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion, while the pious mother of the charity-hou&s;e kept flogging the poor &s;laves daily, becau&s;e they were, as &s;he &s;aid, unbelievers. To one black woman, in parti|cular, &s;he wantonly gave four hundred la&s;hes, who bore them without a complaint.</P>
<P>But to change the di&s;agreeable &s;ubject;&mdash;while I have the lei&s;ure and the opportunity, I feel the inclination to &s;tate to the public a &s;hort account of the trade and in|trin&s;ic value of this blood-&s;pilling colony; which &s;till
<PB N="199" REF="233">
might be richer, did they not follow the example of the woman in the fable with her golden eggs.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, in Surinam are computed to be about &s;ix or eight hundred plantations, producing &s;ugar, coffee, cacao, and cotton, be&s;ides &s;ome indigo, and valuable tim|bers, &amp;c.&mdash;The exportation of which four fir&s;t articles only, and their value, may be &s;een at one view in the following table for four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years.</P>

<P>Having now clearly demon&s;trated, partly by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Dr. Fermyn's <HI>Tableau de la Colonie de Surinam,</HI> and partly by my own experience, that the intrin&s;ic value of this &s;ettlement is worth yearly above <HI>one million</HI> of &s;terling money, which, by proper management, might be &s;till increa&s;ed; al&s;o that the greater part of it goes to the republic, while the people are thus burthened on their e&s;tates by almo&s;t in&s;upportable taxation, which induces many to be rogues, who would perhaps otherwi&s;e be ho|ne&s;t; I &s;hall, by way of appendix, give &s;ome &s;hort ac|count of the trade carried on in this colony by the <HI>North Americans:</HI> &mdash; The&s;e people arrive with &s;mall brigs, &s;loops, and &s;chooners from Virginia, Rhode I&s;land, New York, Bo&s;ton, Jamaica, Grenada, Antigua, Barbadoes, &amp;c. from which places they export flour, beef, pork, her|rings, &s;alt, mackarel, and leaf-tobacco for the negroes; al&s;o fir-boards, Engli&s;h rum, and other &s;pirits; loaf-&s;u|gar
<PB N="205" REF="239">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;aid they can make no rum here; neither do they refine &s;ugar.</NOTE>, &s;permaceti-candles, onions, &amp;c. Be&s;ides each ve&s;&s;el is bound to bring in one hor&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hartzink mentions four hor&s;es, but this is a mi&s;take.</NOTE>, which they often &s;upply, by a head only; affirming, that they put on board a hor&s;e, but that he died on the pa&s;&s;age. For the above commo|dities the American traders export all the mela&s;&s;es of this colony to di&s;til into rum at home, and frequently &s;hip|loads of other productions and merchandize, though this is done in a clande&s;tine manner, by which both the &s;eller and buyer are con&s;iderable gainers, being ready ca&s;h for the one, and a cheap bargain for the other. From the Leeward I&s;lands the&s;e ve&s;&s;els al&s;o import pri|vate mulatto and quaderoon &s;laves, which being gene|rally young and hand&s;ome, whatever may be their mo|ral character, &s;ell for con&s;iderable prices.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn, according to the be&s;t information I was able to acquire, in what the commerce and intrin&s;ic wealth of this fine colony con&s;i&s;t; I will now take my leave of the &s;ubject, and continue my narrative.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of February, Mr. <HI>Reyn&s;dorp,</HI> the &s;on-in-law of Mrs. Godefroy, took me in his &s;ail barge for change of air to <HI>Nuten-Schadelyk,</HI> one of his own coffee e&s;tates; where I &s;aw a white man who had lately lo&s;t both his eyes in one night by the bats or vampires, as they are called; and the following day, &s;ailing up Come|wina River, we proceeded to the delightful <HI>Cacao</HI> plan|tation
<PB N="206" REF="240">
<HI>Alkmaar,</HI> the property of the above lady; where the negro &s;laves are treated like children by the mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom they all look up as to their common parent.&mdash; Here were no groans to be heard, no fetters to be met with, nor any marks of &s;everity to be &s;een&mdash;but all was harmony and content. The &s;uperb hou&s;e and other offices of this charming e&s;tate, where plea&s;ure and ho&s;pi|tality ever reign, I have already repre&s;ented in plate N^o X.; while the fields and gardens, nay, even the negro hou&s;es, bore all the marks of perfect peace and plenty.</P>
<P>The <HI>cacao-trees</HI> are &s;upplied from nur&s;eries for the purpo&s;e, like orchards in England, and planted very re|gularly at ten or twelve feet di&s;tance from each other, where they grow to the height of our Engli&s;h cherry-trees. But the&s;e plantations mu&s;t be well &s;heltered, both from the hard winds and &s;corching &s;un, when young; the roots not entering deep into the ground to &s;uccour them, nor can they at that time bear extraordinary heat; on which account the groves are filled up with ca&s;&s;ava-&s;hrubs or plantain-trees for their &s;helter, and which at the &s;ame time an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of killing the weeds, which grow &s;o luxuriantly in all the tropical climates;&mdash; by the&s;e attentions the trees will bear fruit before they are three years old, when they afford two crops annually, but they are in the highe&s;t perfection at the age of twelve or fourteen. The leaf of the cacao-tree is above eight inches long, and nearly three broad, thick-pointed, ribbed like the laurel-time, and of a bright green-colour.
<PB N="207" REF="241">
The fruit is about the &s;ame &s;ize, and when young re&s;em|bles a cucumber; but when ripe it becomes yellow like a large lemon, with ribs like the melon, and tubercles which enclo&s;e the feed or nuts, near thirty in number: they lie longitudinally in the fruit, and when fit for u&s;e are of the &s;ize of olives, and purple-coloured. The trees are &s;uppo&s;ed to bear at each crop from thirty to three hundred pods, each containing about thirty nuts, weigh|ing one pound, from which a calculation may be made how much will be the produce of each harve&s;t. After a few days the nuts are extracted from the pods, and dried in the &s;hade; during which time they undergo a very &s;trong per&s;piration, when they are put into barrels and fit for tran&s;portation, to be converted into that well-known and agreeable beverage called Chocolate.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the cacao-trees are natives of Guiana, and grow wild in large quantities near the river Amazon: be that as it may, Governor <HI>Chatillon</HI>'s &s;on planted the fir&s;t tree in Surinam in 1684, and the fir&s;t crop was exported to Holland in 1733. A great advantage in cultivating cacao-trees is, that fewer &s;laves are required than in any other branch of the planting bu&s;ine&s;s. How con&s;ider|able are the profits will appear by the accounts of the year 1774, when 506,610 lbs. were exported to Am&s;ter|dam alone, which produced 202,614 <HI>f.</HI> Dutch money, being equal to &pound;. 18,419 &s;terling. The prices have been fluctuating from 4 <HI>d.</HI> to 9 <HI>d. per</HI> lb. the average being
<PB N="208" REF="242">
about 6 &frac12; <HI>d.</HI> The be&s;t e&s;tates, of which <HI>Alkmaar</HI> is one, produce yearly above 80,000 lbs. weight.</P>

<P>On the 27th we returned to town, where the day before a Society &s;oldier was &s;hot for mutiny; and the day fol|lowing a &s;hip was burnt in the roads. At this time the celebrated free negro Qwa&s;i, who was the prophet, prie&s;t, and king of the rangers, &amp;c. went to Holland on a vi&s;it to the Prince of Orange, with letters of recom|mendation from Fourgeoud, who&s;e prai&s;es he was to re|&s;ound, as well as to complain of the Governor for not treating him with due re&s;pect. This being the period for the &s;e&s;&s;ions, another negro's leg was cut off for &s;culk|ing from a ta&s;k to which he was unequal; while two more were condemned to be hanged for running away altogether. The heroic behaviour of one of the&s;e men before the court de&s;erves particularly to be noticed:&mdash;He begged only to be heard for a few moments; which be|ing granted, he proceeded thus:</P>

Two years had I per&s;evered in this manner quite alone, undergoing the greate&s;t hard&s;hips and anxiety of mind, pre&s;erving life only for the po&s;&s;ibility of once more &s;eeing my dear family, who were perhaps &s;tarving on my account, in my own country; I &s;ay two mi&s;erable years had ju&s;t elap&s;ed, when I was di&s;covered by the rangers, taken, and brought before this tribunal, who are now ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of my wretched life, and from whom the only favour I have to a&s;k is, that I may be executed <HI>next Saturday,</HI> or as &s;oon as it may po&s;&s;ibly be convenient."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech was uttered with the utmo&s;t moderation, by one of the fine&s;t-looking negroes that was perhaps ever &s;een; to which his former ma&s;ter, who, as he ob|&s;erved, was now one of the judges, made the following laconic reply &mdash;

Saying which, he threw him&s;elf down on the rack, where amid&s;t the mo&s;t excruciating torments he remained with a &s;mile, without uttering a &s;yllable; nor did he ever &s;peak again, until he ended his unhappy days at the gallows.</P>

<P>Having dined with Colonel Fourgeoud on the 8th of March, when we celebrated the Prince of Orange's birth|day, while Mr. Reyndorp gave a treat to all the &s;oldiers, he acquainted me that the rangers were now alone encamped at the Wana Creek; that the pe&s;tilential &s;pot <HI>Devil's Har|war</HI> was at la&s;t entirely for&s;aken; and that the two lately
<PB N="211" REF="246">
rai&s;ed companies of &s;able volunteers had taken a few pri&s;oners, and killed others on the <HI>Wanica path,</HI> behind Paramaribo. I was at this time a good deal better, but &s;till, not being quite recovered, he who had formerly treated me &s;o &s;everely, now even in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;taying &s;ome longer time at Paramaribo: nay, gave me an offer to re|turn to Europe, which I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; in &s;hort, about the middle of the month, I was as well as ever I was in my life. At this time Colonel Fourgeoud and my&s;elf were daily vi&s;itors of the ladies, in who&s;e company no man could behave better, while I could often not avoid di&s;gu&s;t; indeed &s;o languid were many in their looks, and &s;o unre&s;trained were &s;ome in their conver&s;ation, that a Mrs. <HI>N</HI>&mdash; even a&s;ked me, <HI>&s;ans ceremonie,</HI> to &s;upply the place of her hu&s;band; while &s;he might as well have a&s;ked me to drink, for a reli&s;h, a tumbler of &s;alts.</P>
<P>On the 17th, however, my eyes were better fea&s;ted, when, going to dine with Colonel Texier of the Society troops, I fir&s;t took a walk in the orange grove and the governor's gardens; here, peeping through the foliage, I &s;oon di&s;covered two mo&s;t elegant female figures after bathing, the one a fine young <HI>Samboo,</HI> the other a <HI>bloom|ing Quaderoon,</HI> which la&s;t was &s;o very fair complexioned, that &s;he might have pa&s;&s;ed for a native of Greece, while the ro&s;es that glowed in her cheek were equal to tho&s;e that blo&s;&s;omed in the &s;hrubbery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be remarked, that though Eu|ropeans look pale under the torrid zone, the native inhabitants have often a fre&s;h|ne&s;s peculiarly engaging, particularly mulattoes and quaderoons.</NOTE>. They were walking
<PB N="212" REF="247">
hand in hand, and conver&s;ing with &s;miles near a flowery bank that adorned the &s;ide of a cry&s;tal brook, in which they plunged the in&s;tant they heard me ru&s;tling among&s;t the verdure, like two <HI>mermaids:</HI>
<Q><L>"Then to the flood they ru&s;h'd; the parted flood</L>

<L>"And every beauty &s;oft'ning, every grace</L>
<L>"Flu&s;hing anew, a mellow lu&s;tre &s;hed.</L></Q>
Leaving them to enjoy their innocent amu&s;ement of bathing, I &s;pent the remaining hour before dinner among&s;t the &s;hady fruit-trees, blooming bowers, and &s;erpentine gravel walks; where indeed I &s;aw greater variety of Eu|ropean plants than I imagined were produced in a tro|pical climate, &s;uch as mint, fennel, &s;age, ro&s;emary, gold|en-rod and je&s;&s;amine, the &s;en&s;itive plant, pomegranates, ro&s;es, figs, and even &s;ome grapes.&mdash;Of the pomegranate flowers, a &s;pecimen may be &s;een in plate, N^o XXIX. The &s;igs are both within and without of a beautiful crim&s;on colour; but the ro&s;es are rather pale. Here were &s;ome beautiful pine-apples and melons, which, though they are &s;o generally known, I will neverthele&s;s give &s;ome account of. The imperial fruit, called <HI>Anana</HI> or pine-apple grows in the centre of an elegant &s;ea-green plant, on a &s;talk of the &s;ame hue, about eight inches in length, its leaves diverging near the &s;urface of the earth, which are &s;mooth, long, &s;trong, pointed, and dentulated with hard prickles. The &s;hape of this fruit is nearly oval, the &s;ize of a &s;ugar-loaf, all over chequered, and of

<P>Both the above melons are of the cucumber kind, grow|ing on rough &s;talks, with large leaves, that creep along the ground. It is remarkable that the water-melon, which may be freely eaten in all di&s;tempers without the lea&s;t pernicious con&s;equence, thrives be&s;t in very dry and &s;andy

<P>This morning, a little before I &s;at out, I &s;aw a Mr. <HI>d'Halbergh</HI> terribly bitten by a large iguana or lizard, at the very moment he was pre&s;&s;ing me and my com|panions to &s;tay a few days, to be pre&s;ent at the cele|bration of what he called his <HI>Silver-fea&s;t,</HI> being the twenty-fifth anniver&s;ary of his marriage; but after con|doling with him upon account of the accident, we em|barked in a tent-barge, and arrived that evening at the Spork&s;gift e&s;tate in Matapica. Here we were entertained two days by Captain Mac Neal, with the greate&s;t ho&s;pi|tality. I was however nearly &s;uffocated by the &s;team of &s;ome green coffee, which was &s;pread on the floor of the lodge where I had &s;lung my hammock.</P>
<P>Late on the evening of the 29th, we arrived at the <HI>Gold-mine</HI> plantation, where we found a negro boy and girl, &s;u&s;pended by each others &s;ide from a high beam, by a rope fa&s;tened to their <HI>thumbs,</HI> which were tied behind

their backs, this almo&s;t di&s;located their &s;houlders, and mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t agonizing tortures. Thus I cut the mi&s;erable victims down, without leave or ce|remony, and &s;wore that in&s;tant to demoli&s;h the tyran|nical over&s;eer who had inflicted this new mode of puni&s;h|ment, unle&s;s he promi&s;ed immediately to forgive them; which he miraculou&s;ly did in my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>On the 30th, a little before we landed at the Hope, I di&s;covered that all my &s;ugar, with the greate&s;t part of my rum, was gone; and detected the thief by the follow|ing laughable &s;tratagem (though not my own invention) &mdash;I told the negroes, &s;ix in number, that a parrot's feather was to grow within &s;ix minutes upon the tip of his no&s;e who was mo&s;t guilty; at the &s;ame time pronouncing a few incoherent words, and making two or three circles with my &s;abre, I &s;hut my&s;elf within the tilt: here, peeping through the key-hole, and ob&s;erving the rowers with great attention, without their perceiving me, I &s;oon &s;aw one of them, at every &s;troke of the oar, put up his hand, and feel the tip of his no&s;e; upon which I in&s;tantly ran up to him, and cried,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;ee the parrot's feather! Thou art the thief, thou ra&s;cal!"</Q>
To which the poor &s;uper|&s;titious fellow in&s;tantly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Yaw, me ma&s;&s;era!</HI>"</Q> then kneeling to the <HI>&s;orcerer</HI> for mercy, and the others al&s;o intreating me to &s;pare him, I pardoned the credulous thief and his accomplices, who by their candid confe&s;|&s;ion obtained a piece of &s;alt beef for their dinner, and a gourd full of good grog in the bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="254">Immediately on my arrival I took the command of the whole river, and now was once more the Prince of Comewina. I al&s;o built an elevated <HI>palace,</HI> in imitation of <HI>Prince Bonny</HI>'s at Boo&s;y-Cry, on twelve &s;trong &s;takes; which aerial habitation I found very nece&s;&s;ary, the whole po&s;t being almo&s;t under water by the inundations, and by neglect become a perfect mire-pool, while of my former cottage not a ve&s;tige was to be &s;een. Here I found the marines in perfect mi&s;ery, being almo&s;t naked, and hav|ing &s;old their very &s;hoes for a mouthful of fre&s;h provi|&s;ions. The&s;e grievances, however, by my labour and interce&s;&s;ion with Colonel Fourgeoud, who&s;e favourite I now became more and more, were &s;peedily redre&s;&s;ed, and the Hope, in a little time, appeared like a paradi&s;e, when compared with its former &s;tate.</P>
<P>Shooting was now, as formerly, my favourite diver&s;ion; and on the 4th I brought home a kind of <HI>plover,</HI> a couple of <HI>red-brea&s;ts,</HI> and near a dozen <HI>gra&s;s-&s;parrows.</HI></P>
<P>The plover of Guiana is the &s;ize of a pigeon, its co|lour a dark-brown and white, with tran&s;ver&s;e bars. The wet &s;avannahs are full of them, and they are delicate eating. The red-brea&s;t is a kind of large bull-finch, with the upper part of its body a deep che&s;nut; and all the re&s;t a blood-colour: this is reckoned as good as an ortolan, and abounds on all the plantations. The gra&s;s-&s;parrow, which I think is by &s;ome called the <HI>anaca,</HI> is a beautiful little creature, like a paroquet; the&s;e birds are perfectly green, with a white bill and red eyes. They do
<PB N="219" REF="255">
much damage among&s;t the rice and Indian corn, flying in prodigious flocks upon the plantations.</P>
<P>At the Hope the <HI>trochulus,</HI> or humming-birds, were &s;o thick among the tamarind-trees, that they re&s;embled a &s;warm of bees; a Lieutenant <HI>Swildens</HI> daily fetching down &s;everal of them, by blowing &s;mall peas or Indian corn through a hollow reed.</P>
<P>Of all the tropical birds, this little creature is particu|larly worth attention, not only on account of its beauty, but for its diminutive &s;ize, being &s;maller than the fir&s;t joint of a man's finger; and when deprived of its feathers not larger than a blue-bottle fly. However, there are &s;e|veral &s;pecies, and &s;ome twice as large. The&s;e birds vary much in their colour: in the &s;hade they appear generally of a deep &s;hining green; which, by the reflection of the &s;un, produces a &s;plendid purple brown and azure. The head is cre&s;ted with a &s;mall tu&s;t of feathers, green, black, and gold; the tail and wings are a glo&s;&s;y black; the bill is not much thicker than a pin, it is long, black, and crooked at the end; the tongue is forked, and re&s;embles a red &s;ilk thread; with this they &s;ip the nectar or honey from the flowers, during which time they are &s;tationary, exactly like bees, and this juice &s;eems to be the only nouri&s;hment of the&s;e little creatures. They often make their ne&s;t on the leaf of a wild pine-apple, or dwarf aloe, which is con&s;tructed mo&s;tly of cotton, and not larger than the hu&s;k of a walnut; their eggs are about the &s;ize of peas, and only two in number. Madam Merian &s;ays, that the hum|ming-bird
<PB N="220" REF="256">
&s;its on <HI>four</HI> eggs; which, for my part, I never &s;aw or heard of during my re&s;idence in Guiana.</P>
<P>In the annexed plate I have endeavoured to repre&s;ent them and their little habitation in natural &s;ize; though I found it impo&s;&s;ible to make the drawing more perfect, their motion upon the wing being &s;o very quick, that the feathers are hardly perceptible; and this motion occa|&s;ions that humming noi&s;e, from which this delicate little creature derives its name.</P>
<P>Here were al&s;o immen&s;e flocks of monkies: I have &s;een above two hundred of them in a field of &s;ugar-canes, where they make great deva&s;tation. The&s;e wary animals place &s;entinels all round the field to give the alarm; and I my&s;elf have been a witne&s;s with what &s;agacity and fide|lity they perform this duty, when the whole company hop into the fore&s;t, each with his plunder in his paw.</P>
<P>Swimming was another of my favourite amu&s;ements, which contributed to make me more healthy, and &s;tronger than mo&s;t of my companions; as it is beautifully expre&s;&s;ed by the author of the <HI>Sea&s;ons:</HI>&mdash;

Fourgeoud being reached me, unfortunately fell over|board into the water, and &s;ank immediately; &s;ome officers, however, the next day coming to the Hope, informed me of the principal contents, <HI>viz.</HI> that Colonel Fourgeoud, being determined once more to &s;cour the woods, had ordered me to &s;end up all my &s;pare men and provi&s;ions, as al&s;o the Society troops who were now at Oranjebo, the former to Magdenberg, and the latter to the river Pirica; which I performed, retaining only twelve crippled &s;oldiers at the Hope, and as many at Cla|renbeek, without either &s;urgeon or medicines; neverthe|le&s;s, with this &s;mall number, I made daily patroles by land and water&mdash;they al&s;o informed me of the death of en&s;ign <HI>Van Halm,</HI> and that another &s;hip with &s;ick was ordered &s;hortly to &s;et &s;ail for Holland.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud, though he him&s;elf remained &s;till at Paramaribo, yet continued attentively to command. Thus, on the 23d, he ordered a detachment of one hun|dred men to reconnoitre from Magdenberg to the Wana Creek and Marawina river; but they returned without any new di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>As I was now likely to be continued at the Hope for &s;ome time, I &s;ent for my &s;heep and poultry, from the e&s;tate where I had left them, pre&s;enting Mr. <HI>Gourly</HI> with a ram and a ewe, as being of a breed &s;uperior to any in the colony; and I found with joy that my flocks had con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed in numbers.</P>
<P>On the 26th one of my men brought me a &s;nake,
<PB N="222" REF="259">
which he had ju&s;t killed; it was about four feet long, and not thicker than the barrel of a mu&s;ket; when per|ceiving a knob near its middle, larger than my fi&s;t, I had the curio&s;ity to cut it open, and an enormous frog made its appearance, perfectly alive and entire, a &s;mall &s;pot on the back of its head and neck excepted, which was blue and &s;limy, as if beginning to putrify. For the &s;ake of experiment, I fa&s;tened him with a &s;tring to his foot upon a gra&s;s-plat near the river for three days; when finding the poor animal hearty and well, I gave him his liberty, with a caution to keep a better look-out for the future.</P>
<P>On the 28th I paid a vi&s;it to <HI>Thomas Palmer,</HI> E&s;q. late King's coun&s;ellor at Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay, upon his e&s;tate called <HI>Fairfield.</HI> Here both the ma&s;ter and his &s;laves were perfectly happy and contented, chiefly owing to Mr. Palmer's ju&s;t and equitable admini&s;tration to all around him; and &s;uch were the con&s;equences of his wi&s;e govern|ment, that few plantations in the We&s;t Indies could boa&s;t of greater pro&s;perity, either in point of produce or popula|tion; while the courte&s;y and ho&s;pitality of the gentleman-like proprietor to &s;trangers, completed his happy charac|ter, which &s;hone con&s;picou&s;ly throughout the colony.</P>
<P>Upon my return to the Hope I received a letter from the commander in chief, informing me that Mr. Vin&s;ack with his rangers had killed &s;everal rebels, and taken eleven pri&s;oners; but that another party of the rangers had been &s;urprized by the enemy, and &s;everal of them &s;hot dead while a&s;leep in their hammocks.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="260">During the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, an in&s;tance of pre&s;ence of mind was exhibited by a rebel negro, I think but &s;eldom equalled:&mdash;A ranger having levelled his piece was ju&s;t going to fire at him, when the man called out, holding up his hand,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, Sir, do you mean to kill one of your own party?"</Q>
Which the ranger believing him to be, replied, <Q REND="inline">"God forbid!"</Q> and dropping the muzzle of his piece, in&s;tantly received a ball through the body from his adver&s;ary, which killed him; and who, having thus &s;aved him&s;elf, di&s;appeared like a fla&s;h of lightning. One of the captive negroes related, that the evening before they were taken, a rebel, who had formerly de&s;erted from Fau|conberg was cut to pieces with &s;abres, by Bonny's com|mand, as two others had been before we took Gado-Saby.</P>
<P>On the 6th of May it blew a violent hurricane, accom|panied with thunder and lightning, &s;o that many trees were torn up by the roots, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es on the Hope blown down or unroofed; my aerial palace, how|ever, by good fortune, with&s;tood this gale; and upon the 8th, Joanna, with her boy, arriving at this place, I promi&s;ed my&s;elf a &s;cene of happine&s;s equal to that I experienced in 1774; e&s;pecially as my family, my &s;heep, and my poultry, were now doubled; be&s;ides, I had at this time a beautiful garden, and if I could not with propriety be called a planter, I might at lea&s;t claim, with &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice, the name of a little farmer.</P>
<P>On the 9th we all dined with Mr. <HI>de Graaff,</HI> at his beau|tiful
<PB N="224" REF="261">
plantation <HI>Knoppemombo,</HI> in Ca&s;&s;awina Creek, where this worthy man had foretold, before the birth of my boy, that both he and his mother &s;hould one day be happy and free. Here I &s;aw the following roots and plants, which I have not yet ob&s;erved.&mdash;The <HI>tayers,</HI> which are the hearts of a farinaceous green &s;hrub, not above two or three feet high, with remarkable large leaves, in the form of a heart, the trunk &s;omething re&s;embling that of a banana-tree. This plant being cut down, and with a knife dive&s;ted of its outer tegument, has the appear|ance and con&s;i&s;tency of a yam or potatoe, but is better eating, having a much finer grain. The tayers are of different kinds; the &s;malle&s;t is preferred, and made u&s;e of in the &s;ame manner as the above roots. I have here al&s;o found a kind of real potatoe, and in large quantities, but they are only u&s;ed by the negroes, being inferior to the hog-potatoes in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The <HI>tobacco plant</HI> grows here with large downy leaves, full of fibres; it flowers almo&s;t continually, and will la&s;t for twelve or fourteen years, but is &s;o inferior to the Vir|ginia tobacco, that it is only u&s;ed by the &s;laves. This plant derived its name from the i&s;land <HI>Tobago,</HI> where it was fir&s;t di&s;covered, in 1560.</P>
<P>They have here al&s;o a kind of wild <HI>tea,</HI> which is accounted very whole&s;ome, but in my opinion is no better than Engli&s;h ground-ivy. I found plenty of <HI>tomat&egrave;,</HI> which being produced in many Briti&s;h gar|dens, I will not attempt to de&s;cribe; but only ob&s;erve
<PB N="225" REF="262">
that the Jews are particularly fond of it, and &s;tew it with butchers meat in&s;tead of onions.</P>
<P>The <HI>phy&s;ic-nut</HI> tree is likewi&s;e to be met with here; this is a knotty &s;hrub, that grows about ten or twelve feet in height, and very &s;lender; the nut that it produces has a kernel like an almond, and ta&s;tes as well, provided it be deprived of a thin white &s;kin that adheres to it, otherwi&s;e a violent vomiting and purging is the immediate con&s;e|quence of &s;wallowing it. They al&s;o &s;hewed me &s;everal kinds of peas and beans, and other fruits growing in pods; &s;uch as the <HI>ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> a &s;hining hard yellow &s;eed inclo&s;ed in a woody &s;hell near &s;ixteen inches long, and very &s;mall, with a black &s;oft pulp as &s;weet as honey: this is con&s;i|dered as a very &s;afe laxative: the ca&s;&s;ia grows on a tree very common in Guiana, and which is called <HI>&s;oete boonties</HI> and <HI>cotiaan.</HI> Another kind of pod, named <HI>&s;eve-yaars boontie,</HI> is &s;o called, becau&s;e it is &s;aid to be in blo&s;&s;om &s;even years before it produces.

La&s;tly, I &s;aw a vegetable or flower here called <HI>&s;even-boom,</HI> which is too frequently u&s;ed by the young negro girls to promote abortion, as are al&s;o the green pine-apples, which are &s;aid to have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;pent not only an agreeable but an in|&s;tructive day at Knoppemombo, we took leave of our very good friend in the evening, and rowed contentedly

back to the Hope, our boat being nearly loaded with pre|&s;ents of every kind, among&s;t which were &s;ome fine co|coa-nuts, that one of his &s;laves, after walking, I may &s;ay more properly than climbing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. II. page 69. plate L.</NOTE>, up the tree, had brought down in my pre&s;ence, and after a fierce engagement with a black &s;erpent upon the very top of it, which by the help of his knife he vanqui&s;hed, and to our admiration dropped it down dead at our feet.</P>
<P>The &s;laves of the Hope and Fauconberg al&s;o te&s;|tified their re&s;pect for Joanna and her boy, by bringing in pre&s;ents of fowls, fruit, eggs, veni&s;on, and fi&s;h; and Mr. Palmer hand&s;omely pre&s;ented us with a large quan|tity of Indian corn to feed our poultry. Thus every thing &s;eemed to contribute to our felicity, which was however con&s;iderably allayed by the di&s;agreeable news we received on the 18th, informing me of the death of my dear friend, Mr. Walter Kennedy, &s;hortly after his arrival in Holland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman a little before his departure &s;hewed me a letter from the un|happy youth <HI>Campbell</HI>; which, after thank|ing him for every civility, and acquaint|ing him with his di&s;&s;olution (which he had felt approach) was &s;igned,

<P>To amu&s;e my mind from the&s;e unplea&s;ing &s;ubjects, I now paid a &s;hort vi&s;it to my French acquaintance <HI>Mon|&s;ieur

Cachelieu,</HI> at his plantation Egmond. Here, among&s;t other company, I met with an Italian, a planter called D'O&mdash;s, who had but one arm; with which, however, he took up a knife at table, and without the &s;malle&s;t provo|cation, as I &s;at next him, made a back thru&s;t at me, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all who were pre&s;ent.

<P>So violent was this unhappy man's di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;ome little time before, he ordered a poor negro woman, who was advanced eight months in her pregnancy, to be flogged, until her inte&s;tines appeared, and that only for breaking a tumbler. One of his male &s;laves, trying to evade his &s;everity, was &s;hot dead on the &s;pot; and there was not a &s;lave belonging to his e&s;tate but was cut by the la&s;h of his whip from the neck to the heel.</P>
<P>Colonel Fourgeoud now &s;ending a proper &s;upply of men, with a &s;urgeon and medicines, the Hope wore a more plea&s;ing a&s;pect, and health and content began to be vi&s;ible in every countenance. Among&s;t other things, I encouraged the men to catch fi&s;h, which were here in abundance, and the negroes taught them how to make
<PB N="228" REF="265">
the proper &s;nares, &s;uch as the <HI>&s;pring-hook,</HI> and <HI>man&s;oa</HI> or &s;pring-ba&s;ket. I have given a repre&s;entation of both the&s;e in the plate annexed, where the &s;pring-hook is expre&s;&s;ed by the letter <HI>A,</HI> being a long ela&s;tic pole, like a &s;trong fi&s;hing-rod, &s;tuck in the ground under water, at the other end of which is fixed a double line, the &s;horte&s;t having fa&s;tened to it a &s;mall &s;tick, ten inches long, and the other the &s;ame, but a little lower; while at the ex|tremity of <HI>this</HI> line is hooked a &s;mall fi&s;h by the fins, in &s;uch a manner as to &s;wim to and fro, and be a bait for the larger &s;pecies. Two long &s;ticks being next placed in the ground &s;o as to appear above water, a third &s;tick much &s;horter, forms them like a gallows; above this gallows is bent and fixed the ela&s;tic pole, by means of the double line and its beams; but in &s;o very &s;light a manner, that upon the lea&s;t touch the whole ap|paratus gives way, and the large pole erects it&s;elf, when the fi&s;h that occa&s;ioned the &s;pring, by taking the bait, is &s;u&s;pended to the hook in the air, as exhbited by the figure <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>man&s;oa</HI> or &s;pring-ba&s;ket is much upon the &s;ame con&s;truction, and may be &s;een by referring to letter <HI>C,</HI> where it is repre&s;ented open and under water, with the bait &s;wimming in it. This ba&s;ket is made of warimbo reeds, in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf (the above apparatus being fixed to the middle) in the &s;mall end of which the ela&s;tic pole is fa&s;tened, while at the other end is an open trap-door, the whole being &s;upported in an erect po&s;ition

by a forked &s;tick. No &s;ooner has a large fi&s;h entered and taken the bait, than this pole, as in the former, erects it&s;elf with a &s;pring, and the &s;nap or trap-door &s;huts on the invader, and he is taken, as may be &s;een by letter <HI>D.</HI> This differs from the former, no hook of any kind being nece&s;&s;ary. An idea of the ingenuity of the negroes may be formed from the&s;e con&s;tructions, as this mode of catching their fi&s;h requires no attendance, for the &s;naps being &s;et at night, the fi&s;h is found in the morning, which is generally the newmara or barracota already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Among the variety of fi&s;h caught here was the <HI>&s;iliba,</HI> a &s;mall oval fi&s;h, marked not unlike a pine-apple; the <HI>&s;okay,</HI> which is a large fi&s;h, and very good eating; the <HI>torro-torro,</HI> and another called <HI>tarpoen</HI>; the fir&s;t three feet in length; the other, which is white, about two feet &s;ix inches.</P>
<P>On the 26th, I &s;aw a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;play of activity, &s;trength, and courage by a young female negro, called <HI>Clardina,</HI> at the Hope; where a wild &s;tag having &s;trayed from the flock, at the moment it came bounding over the foot-path &s;he &s;eized it in full &s;peed by the hinder leg, but not being able to &s;top it, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be dragged to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, nor until &s;he was terribly wounded would &s;he let go her hold.</P>
<P>The Hope was now truly a charming habitation, being perfectly dry even in &s;pring-tides, and wa&s;hed by plea&s;|ing canals that let in the fre&s;h-water every tide; while the hedges &s;urrounding the fields and gardens were
<PB N="230" REF="268">
neatly cut, and produced fruit and vegetables of many &s;pecies for our u&s;e. The hou&s;es and bridges were al&s;o all repaired, while the &s;tricte&s;t adherence to cleanline&s;s was recommended and enforced among the men: by the&s;e means not one &s;ick per&s;on out of fifty was now to be found, where &s;loth, &s;tench, and di&s;ea&s;e had &s;o lately &s;pread their de&s;tructive influence, and to which the land and &s;ea-&s;curvy had given the mo&s;t fatal a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of the above &s;corbutic complaints, the former covers the body over with blotches, and the latter chiefly affects the teeth and gums.</P>
<P>I now enjoyed the greate&s;t flow of health and &s;pirits, while mo&s;t of my old &s;hip-mates were either dead or re|turned to Europe; not a &s;ingle officer at this time being in rank above me, except only &s;uch as had been formerly inured to the We&s;t India climate.</P>
<P>But to return to my garden&mdash;this at pre&s;ent exhibited carrots, cabbages, onions, cucumbers, lettuces, radi&s;hes, pepper, cre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. all thriving as well as in Europe; be&s;ides &s;orrel of two kinds, the common and the red, this la&s;t grows upon a &s;hrub, and is excellent for making jam or marmalade. The je&s;&s;amine al&s;o was found here of different &s;pecies, that growing on a &s;mall tree being mo&s;t admired: it is of a pale but beautiful red colour, and a mo&s;t agreeable &s;mell; the leaves are thick, &s;hining, and filled with a milky juice. A &s;pecies of &s;en&s;itive &s;hrub they call <HI>&s;hame-&s;hame,</HI> grew al&s;o here, as did the &s;leep|ing plant, &s;o called from its leaves, which are &s;et in pairs,
<PB N="231" REF="269">
clapping clo&s;e together from &s;un-&s;et to &s;un-ri&s;e, and ap|pearing as if the two were but one; but as &s;oon as the &s;un is up they again open, and re&s;ume their double form. The above-mentioned &s;hrubs were all di&s;per&s;ed through my hedges, be&s;ides pomegranates and Indian ro&s;es, which blow every day; while a few elegant red-lilies, which al&s;o grow wild in the &s;avannas, adorned the banks of my canals, the leaves of which flower have a very bright and beautiful green poli&s;h.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, we were vi&s;ited, among&s;t others, by a Madame <HI>de Z&mdash;e,</HI> in company with her brother, and a Mr. <HI>Schadts,</HI> who were lately arrived from Holland; this lady was &s;uppo&s;ed the fine&s;t woman that even Europe produced, as well as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed. She &s;poke &s;everal languages, and was a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of mu&s;ic and painting; &s;he danced elegantly, and rode va&s;tly well on hor&s;eback; &s;he even excelled in &s;hooting and fencing, &amp;c. In order to make her perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of all the fa|&s;hionable exerci&s;es, I offered her my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in teach|ing her to &s;wim, which, however, with a &s;mile, &s;he thought proper to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>My &s;oldiers, and even negroes, &s;eemed now completely happy, among&s;t whom the mo&s;t perfect harmony &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted; while I frequently indulged them with a merry evening, and a grey-beard of rum.</P>
<P>One night, in the mid&s;t of this fe&s;tivity, I &s;ecretly or|dered the &s;entinel to fire his piece, and cau&s;e a fal&s;e alarm, as if the enemy were on the e&s;tate; when I had
<PB N="232" REF="270">
the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee them &s;eize their arms, and ru&s;h out with the utmo&s;t order and intrepidity. This experi|ment I was the rather inclined to put in practice, as it was reported that the rebels intended &s;oon to pay a vi&s;it to the River Comewina. But we &s;oon experienced that no &s;cene of perfect felicity can be la&s;ting, for the dry &s;ea&s;on now &s;uddenly &s;etting-in, di&s;ea&s;e and mortality once more began to rage among us, ten or twelve men dying daily at the Java Creek and Magdenburg, while tho&s;e under my command at the Hope dimini&s;hed hourly.</P>
<P>On the 3d, the &s;urgeon made me the following report,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That my En&s;ign, Mr. <HI>Decabanes,</HI> had his anchor-apeek, and would certainly &s;et &s;ail for the other world with the ebb-tide;"</Q>
which was really the ca&s;e, for he died that very evening. This grieved me the more, as he had obtained his commi&s;&s;ion through my intere&s;t, and bore an excellent character.</P>
<P>On the 4th of June, the &s;pring-flood broke down my dams while we were drinking the King's health, and laid the whole po&s;t under water, which created va&s;t confu|&s;ion; and in this di&s;tre&s;s the over&s;eer <HI>Blenderman</HI> re|fu&s;ed to lend me any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which occa&s;ioned &s;o vio|lent a quarrel, that he was glad to take to his heels, and make his e&s;cape from the plantation. I &s;hall never have done mentioning the in&s;olence of the&s;e &s;avage brutes, who mo&s;tly are the refu&s;e of the earth, brought up in Germany, or el&s;ewhere, under the cane of a corpo|ral.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well," &s;aid one of the&s;e mi&s;creants ironically to an old <HI>free</HI> negro,

&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, &s;ir," replied the black man,
"we do not think that the monkies are damn'd Chri&s;tians; but I, and all of us, believe that many who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians are a pack of damn'd monkies."</Q>
&mdash; Which pointed repartee afforded me infinite &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Of the admini&s;trators I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, nor of the apprai&s;ers of e&s;tates; having, I believe, already mentioned that the fir&s;t got ten <HI>per cent.</HI> of all the produce, and many of the latter enrich the purcha&s;ers and them&s;elves by &s;elling under the value &s;uch property as is entru&s;ted to their care.</P>
<P>On the 7th, Mr. <HI>Moryn,</HI> admini&s;trator of the Hope, being in a piece of newly-cultivated ground on the op|po&s;ite &s;hore, I rowed over to obtain &s;atisfaction of the im|pertinent Blenderman, who was along with him; but this fellow's cowardice being equal to his in&s;olence and barbarity, he made every conce&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed like|wi&s;e to repair my dams, rather than run the ri&s;que of broken bones&mdash;thus a reconciliation was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Walking through the&s;e new fields, where a neat hou&s;e was already built, I &s;aw &s;ome beautiful birds, among&s;t which was the <HI>wood-pecker.</HI> I ought indeed to have de|&s;cribed this bird before, and another, the name unknown to me, having had an opportunity of doing it when I was at Magdenburg, but I then took only drawings of them.
<PB N="234" REF="272">
The wood-pecker is about the &s;ize of a thru&s;h, and of an elegant cinnamon-colour, &s;peckled with dark brown and yellow; near the rump it is entirely yellow; the head is cre&s;ted with a fine crown of &s;mall feathers, of the &s;ame colour as the body: the tail is long and black; the bill is &s;traight, and of a &s;ea-green colour, as are the legs and iris of the eyes, under which on each &s;ide are two &s;pots of beautiful crim&s;on.</P>
<P>The anonymous bird, which, however, the negroes called <HI>woodo-lou&s;o-fowlo,</HI> from its feeding on wood|lice, is larger than the former, and uncommonly bril|liant in its plumage; the head and upper part of its body being of a rich gra&s;s green; the brea&s;t and belly crim&s;on, divided by an a&s;h-coloured bar. The tail is long, and of a dark blue, as are the prime feathers in the wings, which are al&s;o divided from the green by another a&s;h-coloured bar; the bill is yellow and hooked, being &s;urrounded by a number of &s;mall black feathers, as are the eyes, the iris of which is of a blood colour. (Both the&s;e birds may be &s;een in the annexed plate.)&mdash;As I have already ob&s;erved, however rich and beautiful the plumage may be which decorates the groves of Surinam, the melodious &s;ong there is but &s;eldom heard. They had al&s;o here the tame <HI>galinas,</HI> or Guinea-hens, called <HI>tokay,</HI> which being &s;o well known in England, require no par|ticular de&s;cription.</P>

with &s;harp-pointed follicles, growing le&s;s as they ap|proach the &s;ummit. This tree has numerous thick leaves diverging at its ba&s;e, like the pine-apple plant, which are very long, broad pointed, and dentulated with &s;trong prickles. On the top grows a clu&s;ter of yellow flowers, who&s;e pedicles contain the &s;eed of future aloes, and which never fail to come to perfection in the &s;pace of two months.</P>
<P>In the &s;kirts of the &s;urrounding woods I &s;aw al&s;o the <HI>vanillas,</HI> or <HI>banilla,</HI> which is a &s;hrub that climbs up along the trunks of other trees, adhering to the back like ne|bees or ivy, by the help of its tendrils: the leaves are prodigiou&s;ly thick, and dark green, the fruit con&s;i&s;ting of a triangular pod &s;ix or eight inches long, and filled with &s;mall poli&s;hed &s;eeds. The&s;e pods, being dried a fortnight in the &s;un, become brown, and have a fat rich aromatic ta&s;te, and mo&s;t agreeable flavour; on which ac|count they are u&s;ed to &s;cent the chocolate. There are different kinds of <HI>vanilla,</HI> but that is mo&s;t e&s;teemed which has its pods the mo&s;t long and mo&s;t &s;lender.

<P>As I returned to the Hope, I met Cojo, Joanna's uncle, who had &s;hot one of the <HI>bowling baboons,</HI> which he brought to the Hope to &s;hew it me. The&s;e animals are the &s;ize of a &s;mall bull-dog, and the colour a reddi&s;h-brown, with long hair; they have al&s;o a beard, and are upon the whole extremely ugly; but what chiefly di&s;|tingui&s;hes them from other monkies is their abominable

howl, which they perform in chorus whole groupes to|gether, and &s;o loud, that it may be heard above a mile; the&s;e di&s;cordant concerts, the negroes told me, they ge|nerally repeat, both night and day, at the time of high water, which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the baboons know by in|&s;tinct.&mdash;When &s;peaking of in&s;tinct in animals, I cannot omit relating the following &s;ingular fact; after which I &s;hall return to the hi&s;torical part of my narrative.</P>
<P>On the 16th I was vi&s;ited by a neighbouring gentle|man, whom I conducted up my ladder; but he had no &s;ooner entered my aerial dwelling, than he leapt down from the top to the ground, roaring like a madman with agony and pain, after which he in&s;tantly plunged his head into the river; but looking up, I &s;oon di&s;covered the cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s to be an enormous ne&s;t of wild bees or <HI>wa&s;&s;ee-wa&s;&s;ee,</HI> in the thatch, directly above my head, as I &s;tood within my door; when I immediately took to my heels as he had done, and ordered them to be de|moli&s;hed by my &s;laves without delay. A tar mop was now brought, and the deva&s;tation ju&s;t going to com|mence, when an old negro &s;tepped up, and offered to re|ceive any puni&s;hment I &s;hould decree if ever one of the&s;e bees &s;hould &s;ting <HI>me in per&s;on.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ma&s;&s;era," &s;aid he,
"they would have &s;tung you long ere now had you been a &s;tranger to them; but they being your tenants, that is gradually allowed to build upon your premi&s;&s;es, they a&s;&s;uredly know both you and your's, and will never hurt either you or them."</Q>
I in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ented to the
<PB N="237" REF="278">
propo&s;ition, and tying the old black man to a tree, or|dered my boy Quaco to a&s;cend the ladder quite naked, which he did, and was <HI>not</HI> &s;tung; I then ventured to follow, and I declare upon my honour, that even after &s;haking the ne&s;t, which made its inhabitants buz about my ears, not a &s;ingle bee attempted to &s;ting me. I next relea&s;ed the old negro, and rewarded him with a gallon of rum and five &s;hillings for the di&s;covery. This &s;warm of bees I &s;ince kept unhurt, as my body-guards, and they have made many over&s;eers take a de&s;perate leap for my amu&s;ement, as I generally &s;ent them up my ladder upon &s;ome frivolous me&s;&s;age, when I wi&s;hed to puni&s;h them for inju&s;tice and cruelty, which was not &s;eldom.</P>
<P>The above negro a&s;&s;ured me, that on his ma&s;ter's e&s;tate was an ancient tree, in which had been lodged ever &s;ince he could remember, a &s;ociety of <HI>birds,</HI> and an|other of <HI>bees,</HI> who lived in the greate&s;t harmony toge|ther; but &s;hould any &s;trange birds come to di&s;turb or feed upon the bees, they were in&s;tantly repul&s;ed by their feathered allies, and if &s;trange bees dared to venture near the birds ne&s;ts, the native &s;warm attacked the invaders, and &s;tung them to death: that his ma&s;ter and family had &s;o much re&s;pect for the above a&s;&s;ociation, that the tree was con&s;idered as &s;acred, and was not to be touched by an axe until it &s;hould yield to all-de&s;troying time.</P>
<P>On the 22d, a patrole arrived from Rietwyk, in Pirica, who informed me, that a party of our troops were ju&s;t returned to Java Creek from a cruize to <HI>Vredenburg,</HI> at
<PB N="238" REF="279">
the Marawina; and that, in conjunction with the rangers, they had during this campaign de&s;troyed many fields of provi&s;ions belonging to the rebels: al&s;o, that for their faithful &s;ervices, our &s;able allies had been complimented by the Society with new arms, and, for the fir&s;t time, cloathed in green uniform jackets. I further learned that the <HI>amba&s;&s;adors</HI> to the <HI>Owca</HI> and <HI>Serameca</HI> negroes were returned after a fruitle&s;s journey, as neither of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations would lend the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In con&s;e|quence of this refu&s;al, Colonel Fourgeoud, being wearied him&s;elf, and having exhau&s;ted his troops in de&s;troying mo&s;t of the rebel &s;ettlements, at length determined to re|linqui&s;h the whole expedition; which re&s;olution he pre|viou&s;ly communicated to his Serene Highne&s;s the Prince of Orange at the Hague.</P>
<P>On the 23d I received po&s;itive orders to prepare and be ready on the 15th of July, to break up, with all the troops under my command, leave the River Comewina, and row down to Paramaribo, where the tran&s;port &s;hips were put in commi&s;&s;ion to convey us back to Holland. This order I in&s;tantly read before the front to all my men, who received it with unbounded joy and three cheers&mdash;but I alone &s;ighed bitterly. &mdash; Oh my Joanna! Oh my boy! who were at this time both dangerou&s;ly ill, the one with a fever, the other with convul&s;ions, &s;o that neither were expected to &s;urvive. Add to this, that I ran a nail quite through my foot&mdash;thus was completely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>During this &s;cene of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, the <HI>&s;trix</HI> or
<PB N="239" REF="280">
<HI>night-owl</HI> of Guiana regularly paid us his nocturnal vi|&s;its, even in the apartment where we lay, pouring out his melancholy hootings, until he was killed by one of my black attendants. This bird is here called <HI>Ooroocoocoo,</HI> from its note, to which this word has &s;ome affinity. It is about the &s;ize of a pigeon; the bill is yellow, and hooked like that of a &s;parrow-hawk; the eyes are al&s;o yellow; the tongue is cloven; the ears very vi&s;ible; the legs &s;trong, &s;hort, and armed with &s;harp claws: the ge|neral colour of this bird is a pale brown, except the brea&s;t and belly, which are white, intermixed with &s;ome &s;pots of amber. The &s;uper&s;titious negroes generally believe that where the night-owl makes his appearance morta|lity mu&s;t en&s;ue: which prejudice is the more excu&s;able, as this creature only frequents the apartments of the &s;ick; but the real cau&s;e which attracts the animal, I ap|prehend to be the <HI>lights</HI> that upon the&s;e occa&s;ions are generally kept burning all night, or po&s;&s;ibly the morbid and putrid air, which excites its appetite for prey.</P>
<P>An old Indian woman of Joanna's acquaintance being now &s;ent for to the Hope, I my&s;elf was &s;oon cured by her &s;kill and attention; but my little family continued &s;o very unwell, that I thought it right to &s;end them to Parama|ribo before it was too late. And on the 10th of July I &s;ent all my &s;heep and poultry to Fauconberg, one couple of fat ewes excepted, which I killed, and with which, by the addition of fi&s;h and veni&s;on, I entertained for two days following twenty-four of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable inha|bitants

in the river, while the white bread, fruit, and Spani&s;h wines to help out the fea&s;t, I received as a pre|&s;ent from my very worthy friend, Mr. James Gourland, at Berghoven.</P>
<P>On the 13th I ordered down the troops from <HI>Claren|beek,</HI> where an ho&s;pital had been a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time erected, and they this evening anchored off the Hope.</P>
<P>On the 14th, an officer of the Honourable Society troops arrived to relieve me in the command of the river; and his men from that moment began to perform the duty.</P>
<P>I now removed my flag from the Hope to the barges; and in the evening took my la&s;t farewel of Joanna's relations on the Fauconberg e&s;tate; who, crouding round me, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow aloud for my departure, and with tears invoked the protection of Heaven for my &s;afe and pro&s;perous voyage.</P>
<P>On the 15th we finally left the Hope, having marched my troops on board the barges at ten o'clock, A. M.; and at noon I fired my pi&s;tol as a &s;ignal to weigh anchor, when we immediately proceeded down the River Come|wina for the roads of Paramaribo, to be embarked on board the tran&s;port &s;hips for Europe.</P>

At the de&s;&s;ert was a fruit called in Surinam <HI>zurzacka,</HI> which I believe by the Engli&s;h is called the <HI>&s;our-&s;ap.</HI> It grows upon a tree of a moderate &s;ize, with a grey bark, and leaves like tho&s;e of the orange-tree, but &s;et in pairs; the fruit is of a pyramidical form, heavier than the large&s;t pear, and all covered over with inoffen&s;ive prickles: the &s;kin is very thin, the pulp a &s;oft pithy &s;ub&s;tance as white as milk, and of a &s;weet ta&s;te, mixed with a mo&s;t agreea|ble acid, in which are &s;eeds like the large kernels of an apple. Another &s;pecies of <HI>&s;mall zurzacka</HI> grows in this country, &s;omething re&s;embling hops, but is of no u&s;e whatever. We had al&s;o the fruit called <HI>&s;abatille,</HI> which grows on a large tree, the leaves like tho&s;e of the laurel. This fruit is the &s;ize of a peach, very round, and of a brown colour, covered over with a &s;oft down: when cut in two, the pulp is not unlike marmalade, in which are found the &s;eeds; it is &s;uch a lu&s;cious &s;weet, that to many palates it is even di&s;agreeable.</P>

In this &s;ituation we affected to bear our fate with perfect re&s;ignation, though what each of us felt in particular may much more ea&s;ily be imagined than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The regiment's colours were now carried on board on the 23d in great &s;tate, which put a final clo&s;e to the ex|pedition, but without receiving any <HI>honours</HI> from Fort Zealandia, not a &s;ingle gun being fired, nor even the flag hoi&s;ted on the occa&s;ion, to the great mortification of Co|lonel Fourgeoud, though in effect it was chiefly owing to his own neglect, as he had never given the Governor <HI>official</HI> notice of his intended departure. The baggage was al&s;o &s;ent on board the &s;hips; and a gentleman of the name of <HI>Van Hey&s;t</HI> entertained the marines at his private expence with three hundred bottles of wine, fruit, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have often remarked the ho&s;pitality and genero&s;ity of the&s;e people, which I now al&s;o once more experienced, receiving various pre&s;ents of fruits and pre&s;erves from my numerous friends, to refre&s;h me at &s;ea while on the voyage; among&s;t the pre&s;erves were the female <HI>pappayas,</HI> the male bearing no fruit. This grows on a grey trunk, near twenty feet high, &s;traight, and pithy within, the top being covered with a crown, and only fourteen or &s;ixteen diverging leaves, extremely large and digitated. The fruit grows clo&s;e to the trunk; the flower or blo&s;&s;om has
<PB N="244" REF="285">
a mo&s;t delicious fragrance. When ripe, it is the &s;ize and &s;hape of a water-melon, and turns from green to yellow, but its pulp is more firm and &s;olid: the inner pulp is &s;oft and &s;limy, filled with innumerable &s;eeds. This fruit at full maturity is cut in pieces and boiled, when it eats like Engli&s;h turnips; but they u&s;e it principally for confec|tionary and &s;weetmeats, when young, and with its blo&s;|&s;oms being both extremely delicate and whole&s;ome. I had al&s;o &s;ent me &s;ome fine pre&s;erved <HI>ginger</HI>; this is the root of a kind of reedy &s;talk, that never exceeds two feet in height, with long, narrow pointed leaves. The&s;e roots are tuberous, flatti&s;h, &s;mall, and clu&s;tered in many different &s;hapes, not unlike pig-potatoes, and of nearly the &s;ame colour in the in&s;ide, but fibrous, acid, hot, and aromatic; the &s;mell is highly fragrant: it is well known to be not only an agreeable pre&s;erve, but in many ca&s;es an excel|lent medicine.&mdash;But to proceed.</P>
<P>On the 24th of July, the &s;ails being bent to the yards, we <HI>at la&s;t</HI> proceeded in corps to take leave of his Excellency the Governor of the colony, who, while he &s;till received us with the greate&s;t politene&s;s, yet gave our hero to under|&s;tand, that were his colours <HI>now</HI> to be &s;ent on board, they &s;hould mo&s;t certainly be &s;aluted with tho&s;e <HI>honours</HI> which indi&s;putably were their due. After which he &s;ent the whole corps of Society officers to the head-quarters in &s;tate, to wi&s;h us a pro&s;perous voyage to Holland; and in this conte&s;t of etiquette his Excellency mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly led the van; for hinting which, however, to &s;ome of Four|geoud's favourites, I had nearly engaged my&s;elf once more
<PB N="245" REF="286">
in a &s;erious quarrel. Our men, who had been on board &s;ince the 18th, being now joined by their officers, the poor remains of this fine regiment were thus finally em|barked, and in the highe&s;t flow of &s;pirits, expecting to &s;et &s;ail the <HI>following day</HI> for Europe; while <HI>(one</HI> alone excepted) every countenance wore the appearance of happine&s;s and joy; and nothing indeed could equal the exultation of the few &s;urviving troops, when the next morning the orders were i&s;&s;ued for the &s;hips to weigh anchor and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>But it was by fate ordained that their eager hopes and expectations once more &s;hould be bla&s;ted: for on the very moment of departure, a &s;hip entered the river with di&s;patches, inclo&s;ing an order for the regiment immediately to <HI>re-enter the woods,</HI> and remain in the colony until relieved by fre&s;h troops to be &s;ent out from Holland for that purpo&s;e. The SINCERE THANKS of his Serene Highne&s;s the Prince of Orange were now read to the men from the quarter-deck of each ve&s;&s;el,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for the manly and &s;pirited conduct they had di&s;played during &s;o long a trial, and &s;o many great and unpre|cedented hard&s;hips;"</Q>
but as they concluded with or|ders for the troops to <HI>di&s;embark,</HI> and remain in this dreadful &s;ervice, I never &s;aw dejection, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair &s;o &s;trongly marked: while at this moment I, who but ju&s;t before had been completely mi&s;erable, was now in turn the only one who was not depre&s;&s;ed with &s;orrow.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="287">In the mid&s;t of this gloomy &s;cene, the men were or|dered to give three cheers, which the marines on board one of the ve&s;&s;els ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to comply with: Colonel Scyburg, and unluckily my&s;elf, were in con&s;e|quence ordered to compel them; which he undertook, with a cane in one hand, and a loaded pi&s;tol cocked in the other. Knowing his temper to be fiery and ira&s;cible, what did I not feel at this moment? I &s;uddenly leapt into the boat that lay along-&s;ide, where, after haranguing tho&s;e few that leaned over the gunwale, I promi&s;ed the <HI>&s;hip's crew</HI> twenty gallons of Holland's gin if <HI>they</HI> would only begin the melancholy chorus. Then mounting again the quarter-deck, I acquainted the Colonel that all were <HI>now</HI> ready and willing to obey his commands; we then re-entered the boat, and in &s;hoving off had the &s;atisfaction to receive three hearty cheers from the &s;ailors, in which joined a few marines, but with &s;uch languid looks and heavy hearts as cannot be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>At this time however the Prince of Orange's goodne&s;s of heart appeared in a con&s;picuous light, as he ordered all private accounts due by the troops to &s;urgeons and phy&s;icians to be paid by the trea&s;ury; which, however trifling it may appear, was no trifle to many of the offi|cers, &amp;c. and evinced an attention in his Serene Highne&s;s which is not always to be found in princes, while all knew his &s;orrow for the hard lot of his &s;oldiers, but which could not yet be di&s;pen&s;ed with, con&s;i&s;tent with the general good.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="288">If our di&s;embarkation di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the troops, it afforded joy to mo&s;t of the coloni&s;ts; as indeed a petition, &s;igned by the principal inhabitants, had been pre&s;ented to Co|lonel Fourgeoud but two days before,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"praying that our regiment might &s;tay &s;ome time longer, and give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the rebels, as we had &s;o gloriou&s;ly begun, and per&s;evered in routing and hara&s;&s;ing them;"</Q>
which indeed was certainly true, for our regiment, in conjunction with the Society and rangers, had demoli&s;hed mo&s;t &s;ettlements the rebels po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the colony, and had driven them to &s;o con&s;iderable a di&s;tance, that their depredations, and the de&s;ertion of &s;laves, were incompa|rably le&s;s than upon our arrival; and this was a&s;&s;uredly much better than the Dutch making a &s;hameful peace with them, as had been done with the rebels of the <HI>Owca</HI> and <HI>Sarameca</HI> &s;ettlements before, yet which would probably again have been the con&s;equence had we not landed in Guiana.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the in&s;olence of <HI>&s;avages,</HI> when per|fectly independant, I mu&s;t relate a conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between one of this de&s;cription and my&s;elf at Pa|ramaribo, where the troops were allowed &s;ome time to refre&s;h them&s;elves before they again retook the field:&mdash; Dining one day at Captain Mac Neyl's, who was now come to town from his e&s;tate, a captain of the <HI>Owca</HI> ne|groes, our <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> allies, came in to demand money from his lady; and being very importunate, I de&s;ired her in Engli&s;h to <Q REND="inline">"give him a dram, and he would be gone;"</Q> which the fellow under&s;tanding, called me without the

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that hou&s;e was my own? and if not, what bu&s;ine&s;s I had to interfere?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am,
&s;aid he, in a thundering voice,

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That my name was Stedman; and that if he dared to utter one in&s;olent expre&s;&s;ion more, my wea|pon &s;hould find the &s;horte&s;t way through his body."</Q>
Upon which he &s;napped his fingers, and marched off, leaving me much di&s;plea&s;ed, and blaming Fourgeoud for &s;hewing &s;o much indulgence to &s;uch a &s;et of banditti. In the evening, as I returned from dinner, I met the &s;ame black fellow again, who, &s;tepping &s;hort up to me, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ma&s;&s;era, you are a man, a very brave fellow; won't you now give &s;ome money to the Owca Captain?"</Q>
This I &s;ternly refu&s;ed; he then ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and &s;hewed his teeth (he &s;aid) in token of reconciliation, promi&s;|ing to &s;end me a pre&s;ent of pi&s;tachio-nuts, which, how|ever, never did arrive, nor indeed &s;hould I have ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Though we continued in Surinam &s;ome time longer, our future &s;ervices could add but very little to its pro|&s;perity, as our numbers were now &s;o very few, and out of this number, &s;mall as it was, <HI>nine</HI> officers and above <HI>one hundred and &s;ixty</HI> privates, all &s;ick and incurable, embark|ed again for Holland on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t. I was ill with an ague at this time, and had the offer of making one of the party, but declined it, being determined to &s;ee the end of the expedition if I could; I however availed my&s;elf
<PB N="249" REF="290">
of the opportunity to &s;end &s;ome pre&s;ents to my friends in Europe; among&s;t the&s;e were a couple of beautiful parrots, two curious monkies, an elegant collection of fine butterflies, three che&s;ts of &s;weetmeats, and &s;ome pickles, all &s;hipped on board the &s;hip <HI>Paramaribo,</HI> and under the care of Serjeant Fowler, who was, poor fellow, one of the invalids bound for Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Medlar</HI> being quite emaciated with fatigue and hard&s;hips, now al&s;o &s;ailed for Holland; thus, during his ab&s;ence acting as major, I began to entertain an expec|tation that I &s;hould one day carry home the regiment my&s;elf, &s;o very rapidly were our officers daily dimini&s;h|ing; and yet among&s;t tho&s;e few who remained two had the courage at this time to venture upon matrimony, and married two Creole ladies, both widows.</P>
<P>Every thing now being peaceable and quiet, I recover|ed my &s;trength &s;o far as on the 10th to walk to Mrs. Godefroy, when I acquainted her that I wi&s;hed much to emancipate at lea&s;t <HI>Johnny Stedman</HI>; and reque&s;ted her to become bail before the court, for the u&s;ual &s;um of &pound;. 300, as he &s;hould never be any charge to the colony of Surinam. But this &s;he peremptorily declined, though there was no ri&s;que, it being only a matter of form; at which I could not help feeling &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, till I was acquainted that &s;he had actually refu&s;ed the &s;ame favour to her own &s;on.</P>
<P>The mention of &s;lavery reminds me of a debt which I &s;eem to have incurred to my reader. I have from time to time given &s;ome account of the mode in which
<PB N="250" REF="291">
&s;laves are brought to this market, and of the man|ner in which they are treated&mdash;But I feel that I have not been &s;ufficiently full upon this &s;ubject; and I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to bring forward all the infor|mation that I have gained concerning the negroes, be|cau&s;e I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hall be able to bring &s;ome truths to light, that have hitherto been unob&s;erved or im|perfectly related, at lea&s;t to the generality of Europeans.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as to the complexion of a negro, this, as I have ob&s;erved before, is I am per&s;uaded en|tirely owing to the burning climate in which he lives, and an atmo&s;phere &s;till more heated by the &s;andy de&s;arts, over which the trade winds pa&s;s before they reach the habitable parts. The Indians of America, on the contrary, who indeed live under the &s;ame degree of latitude, have this wind refre&s;hed by the Atlantic Ocean, and are cop|per-coloured; and the inhabitants of Aby&s;&s;inia, who re|ceive it cooled by the Arabian and the Indian Seas, are entirely olive. Thus north of the great River Senegal the complexion changes from black to brown among&s;t the Moors, as it does toward the &s;outh among&s;t the Caffrarians and the Hottentots; and I am of opinion, that the woolly texture of their hair is an effect proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The epidermis or cuticle of the negroes I have &s;een di&s;&s;ected more than once; it is clear and tran&s;|parent, but between this and the real &s;kin lies a thin fol|licle, which is perfectly black, which being removed by &s;evere flagellation, or by &s;calding, expo&s;es a complexion not inferior to that of an European.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="292">On the e&s;tate <HI>Vo&s;&s;enbergh,</HI> in Surinam, were born two <HI>white negroes,</HI> who&s;e parents were both perfectly black; the one was a female, &s;ent to Paris in 1734; the other a boy, born in March 1738. And in 1794, a &s;imilar woman, <HI>Emelia Lew&s;am,</HI> was exhibited in England, who&s;e children (though &s;he is married to an European) are all mulattoes. The &s;kin of the&s;e people is not of the European white, but more re&s;embles chalk; their hair the &s;ame; their eyes are often red <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is well known to be the ca&s;e with many other animals, as rabbits, mice, &amp;c. that are perfectly white, to have their eyes <HI>blood-coloured.</HI></NOTE>, and they &s;ee very little in the &s;un-&s;hine, neither are they fit for any kind of labour; while their mental faculties, I have been told, u&s;ually corre&s;pond with the debility of their bodies.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;hape</HI> of the African negroes, it is from head to foot certainly different from the European mould, though not, in my opinion, in any degree in|ferior, prejudice being laid a&s;ide. Their &s;trong features, flat no&s;es, thick lips, and high cheek bones, may appear deformities to us, and yet among&s;t them&s;elves may be e&s;|teemed the rever&s;e; their bright black eyes, and fine white teeth, we are forced to admire; and one decided advantage in a black complexion is, that all tho&s;e languid pale &s;ickly-looking countenances, &s;o common in Europe, are never exhibited among them, nor are the wrinkles and ravages of age equally con&s;picuous; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s that when a negro is very ill, his black changes to a very di&s;agreeable &s;allow olive.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="293">For exertion and activity, their &s;hape is a&s;&s;uredly pre|ferable to ours, being generally &s;trong and mu&s;cular near the trunk, and &s;lender towards the extremities; they have mo&s;tly a remarkable fine che&s;t, but are &s;mall about the hips; their buttocks are more prominent, and their necks are thicker than ours; the thighs are &s;trong, as al&s;o the arms above the elbow, but the wri&s;ts and lower part of the legs are very &s;lender; and a good deal indeed of the Herculean make of the late <HI>Broughton</HI> the pugili&s;t may be traced in the form of a vigorous negro. As to the crookedne&s;s of their limbs, it is to be accounted for by the manner in which they are carried whil&s;t infants upon the mother's back, their tender legs being tied clo&s;e round each &s;ide of her wai&s;t, which occa&s;ions that unnatural bent, with which they are not born: nor are their children ever taught to walk, but left to creep among&s;t the &s;and and gra&s;s, until they gradually acquire &s;trength and inclination to erect them&s;elves, which they do very &s;oon; by this cu&s;tom, however, the po&s;ition of their feet is much neglected, yet by exerci&s;e, and daily bathing, they acquire that &s;trength and agility, for which they are &s;o remarkable.</P>
<P>Another cu&s;tom which, in their opinion, conduces much to their health and vigour is, that, during the <HI>two</HI> years in which the mothers &s;uckle their children, they frequently make them &s;wallow large quantities of water, after which they &s;hake them twice a day, with much violence; they are then taken by a leg or an arm, and
<PB N="253" REF="294">
to&s;&s;ed into the river, to be well &s;coured outwardly; nor are the females exempt from this mode of rearing youth, which renders them not inferior to the men, in &s;ize alone excepted, while &s;ome in running, &s;wimming, climbing, and dancing, as well as wre&s;tling, are even their &s;u|periors: thus, that it depends on education to form a race of <HI>Amazonian</HI> females, is a propo&s;ition of which I have very little doubt.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e hardy daughters of the Torrid Zone le&s;s remarkable for propagation. I knew a female &s;er|vant at Mr. de Graaf's, called <HI>Le&s;peranza,</HI> who actu|ally bore <HI>nine</HI> children in the cour&s;e of three years, the fir&s;t year four, the next two, and the third three. They bring their offspring into the world without pain, and like the Indian women re&s;uming their dome&s;tic em|ployments even the &s;ame day. During the fir&s;t week their infants are as fair as any Europeans, except that in the males there is a little appearance of black in a <HI>certain part,</HI> and the whole body becomes gradually of that co|lour. Their females arrive early at the age of puberty; but, as in the fruits of this climate, this early maturity is &s;ucceeded by a &s;udden decay. Many of the negroes, however, live to a very con&s;iderable age: I have &s;een one or two that were above one hundred; and the London Chronicle for October 5, 1780, makes mention of a negro woman, called <HI>Loui&s;a Truxo,</HI> at <HI>Tucomea,</HI> in South Ame|rica, &s;till living, at the &s;urprizing age of one hundred and &s;eventy-five years. In what tables of longevity is there &s;uch an European to be found? though mo&s;t pro|bably
<PB N="254" REF="295">
this venerable per&s;on &s;pent her youth in hard labour, like other &s;laves; which, though a negro can bear much better in a tropical climate than a native of Europe, yet cannot be natural, either on the coa&s;t of Guinea or Guiana, where, without toil, the nece&s;&s;aries of life are produced, and vegetation flouri&s;hes &s;ponta|neou&s;ly for ever.</P>
<P>In the con&s;titution of the negroes I have &s;till ob&s;erved this &s;ingularity, that while they bear the fatigue of labour in the hotte&s;t days, they can al&s;o bear the cold and damp better than an European, at lea&s;t better than I could; &s;leeping all night on the wet gra&s;s, perfectly naked, without any injury to their health, while I have been glad, e&s;pecially early in the morning, to have a fire lit under my hammock, and while the marines for want of it lay in a &s;hiver. They al&s;o bear hunger and thir&s;t, and pain or &s;ickne&s;s, with the greate&s;t patience and re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>I have formerly mentioned the names of more than a dozen of negro tribes: all the&s;e know each other by the different marks and inci&s;ions made on their bodies &mdash; for in&s;tance, the <HI>Coromantyn</HI> negroes, who are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, cut three or four long ga&s;hes on each of their cheeks, as repre&s;ented in the face of the armed free negro or ranger, in plate VII.</P>
<P>The <HI>Loango</HI> negroes, who are reckoned the wor&s;t, di&s;|tingui&s;h them&s;elves by puncturing or marking the &s;kin of their &s;ides, arms, and thighs with &s;quare elevated figures, &s;omething like dice. (See plate LXVIII.) The&s;e

al&s;o cut their fore-teeth to a &s;harp point, which gives them a frightful appearance, re&s;embling in &s;ome degree tho&s;e of a &s;hark: and all their males are circumci&s;ed, after the manner of the Jews.</P>
<P>Among the &s;trange productions of nature, a &s;pecies of people known by the name of <HI>Accorees,</HI> de&s;erves to be particularly noticed.&mdash;The <HI>Accorees,</HI> or Two-fingers, live among&s;t the Seramaca negroes, in the very upper parts of the river of that name. This heterogeneous tribe are &s;o deformed in their hands and feet, that while &s;ome have three or four fingers and toes on each hand and foot, others have only two, which re&s;emble the claws of a lob&s;ter, or rather limbs that have been cured after mu|tilation by fire, or &s;ome other accident. This deformity in one per&s;on would cau&s;e but &s;mall admiration; but that a whole community &s;hould be afflicted with this &s;ingula|rity, is certainly a mo&s;t wonderful phaenomenon. Having &s;een but <HI>two</HI> my&s;elf, and that at too great a di&s;tance to take a drawing of them, I cannot pretend to vouch for the truth of what I have only heard; but an engraving of one of the&s;e figures was po&s;itively &s;ent to the Society of Arts and Sciences at <HI>Haerlem</HI>; while I beg leave to introduce, as a further voucher, the following extract from an old book of &s;urgery and anatomy, procured me by the ingenious and learned <HI>Owen Cambridge,</HI> E&s;quire, of <HI>Twickenham.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After Michaelmas term, in the year 1629, a body was brought from the place of execution to the College of Phy&s;icians, to be cut up for an anatomy; and by chance

the officer of the college brought the body of a cruel wretch, who had murdered the &s;on of one Ma&s;ter Scot, a &s;urgeon of good note in this city.

Such was his face: but the greate&s;t deformity was his feet, and that almo&s;t to admiration; for they were both cloven, but not alike. One foot was equally divided between four and five inches deep into two toes, jointed like other men's toes, but as large each of them as half the foot could make them, with nails proportionable. The left foot was divided likewi&s;e in the middle, but the divi&s;ion was not above three inches deep, or &s;carce &s;o much; the one half, which was towards the body, made one large toe, with a nail proportionable, like the inward half of the right foot; but the outward half was com|pounded of two toes, yet growing clo&s;e and fa&s;t to|gether.

little acquainted; as a &s;pecimen, however, I will in&s;ert a few &s;entences of that called the <HI>Coromantyn,</HI> upon the credit of my boy Quaco, who belonged to that nation, to|gether with a tran&s;lation in Engli&s;h; and only ob&s;erve, that they break off their words very &s;hort, in a kind of guttural manner, which I cannot ea&s;ily de&s;cribe:&mdash;For in|&s;tance &mdash;

The latter they like be&s;t, and con&s;equently u&s;e the mo&s;t. It has been already ob&s;erved, that the Engli&s;h were the fir&s;t Europeans who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this colony, hence probably the predilection for that language, which they have &s;till retained. In this mixed dialect, for which I have &s;een a printed grammar, the words end mo&s;tly with a vowel, like the Indian and Italian, and it is &s;o &s;weet, &s;o &s;onorous and &s;oft, that the genteele&s;t Europeans in Su|rinam &s;peak little el&s;e; it is al&s;o wonderfully expre&s;&s;ive and &s;entimental, &s;uch as, <Q REND="inline">"Good eating, <HI>&s;weety-muffo.</HI>"</Q>&mdash; <Q REND="inline">"Gun-powder, <HI>man &s;anny.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;

<P>This kind of &s;inging is much practi&s;ed by the barge rowers or boat negroes on the water, e&s;pecially dur|ing the night in a clear moon&s;hine; it is to them pe|culiarly animating, and may, together with the &s;ound of their oars, be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>

<P><HI>Ignatius Sancho,</HI> a negro, many years &s;ervant to the Duke of Montagu, who&s;e &s;entimental letters, &s;o generally known, would not di&s;grace the pen of an European, may al&s;o be mentioned on this occa&s;ion; and with regard to their powers of memory and calculation, I &s;hall only notice <HI>Thomas Fuller,</HI> a negro, the property of a Mrs. <HI>Cox</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> North America; and quote one &s;ingular anec|dote, as it is related by Dr. <HI>Ru&s;h</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in a letter to a gentleman at Manche&s;ter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being travelling," &s;ays the Doctor,

When the gentleman who had a&s;ked the que&s;tion took his pen, and having calculated the &s;ame by figures, told the negro he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, as the number he had mentioned was certainly too great. 'Top, Ma&s;&s;era,' &s;aid the negro, 'you have omitted the leap-years;' when having calculated the &s;econds contained in the number of leap-years, and added them, the number was found exactly the &s;ame as that calculated by the negro.

Another lately repeat|ed the <HI>Alcoran</HI> from recollection only.&mdash;What amazing mental faculties in African negroes, who could neither read nor write! Yet that &s;uch things are, is well authen|ticated.</P>
<P>To what I have already advanced, I may add, that all negroes firmly believe the being of a <HI>God,</HI> upon who&s;e goodne&s;s they rely, and who&s;e power they adore, while they have no fear of death, and never ta&s;te food without offering a libation. In the rivers <HI>Gambia</HI> and <HI>Senegal</HI> they are mo&s;tly Mahometans; but generally the wor&s;hip and religious ceremonies of the Africans vary, as do the num|berle&s;s &s;uper&s;titious practices of all &s;avages, and indeed of too many Europeans. Perceiving that it was their cu&s;tom to bring their offerings to the wild cotton-tree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This tree grows to a con&s;iderable height and thickne&s;s, very &s;traight, and covered with a &s;trong grey prickly bark.

I enquired of an old negro, why they paid &s;uch particular reverence and veneration to this growing piece of timber.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This proceeds (&s;aid he) ma&s;&s;era, from the following cau&s;e: having no churches nor places built for public wor&s;hip (as you have) on the Coa&s;t of Guinea, and this tree being the large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful growing there, our people, a&s;&s;embling under its branches when they are going to be in&s;tructed, are defended by it from the heavy rains and &s;corching &s;un. Under this tree our gadoman, or prie&s;t, delivers his lectures; and for this rea&s;on our common people have &s;o much veneration for it, that they will not cut it down upon any ac|count whatever."</Q></P>
<P>No people can be more &s;uper&s;titious than the gene|rality of negroes; and their <HI>Locomen,</HI> or pretended pro|phets, find their intere&s;t in encouraging this &s;uper&s;tition, by &s;elling them <HI>obias</HI> or amulets, as I have already men|tioned, and as &s;ome hypocrites &s;ell ab&s;olution in Europe, for a comfortable living. The&s;e people have al&s;o among&s;t them a kind of <HI>Sibyls,</HI> who deal in oracles; the&s;e &s;age matrons dancing and whirling round in the middle of an a&s;&s;embly, with amazing rapidity, until they foam at the mouth, and drop down as convul&s;ed. Whatever the pro|phete&s;s orders to be done during this paroxi&s;m, is mo&s;t &s;acredly performed by the &s;urrounding multitude; which renders the&s;e meetings extremely dangerous, as &s;he fre|quently enjoins them to murder their ma&s;ters, or de&s;ert to the woods; upon which account this &s;cene of exce&s;&s;ive fanatici&s;m is forbidden by law in the colony of Surinam,
<PB N="263" REF="304">
upon pain of the mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;hment: yet it is often practi&s;ed in private places, and is very common among&s;t the Owca and Seramica negroes, where captains Fredericy and Van Geurick told me they had &s;een it per|formed. It is here called the <HI>winty-play,</HI> or the dance of the mermaid, and has exi&s;ted from time immemorial; as even the cla&s;&s;ic authors make frequent mention of this ex|traordinary practice. <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his &s;ixth book, makes Eneas vi&s;it the Sibyl of Cuma; and <HI>Ovid</HI> al&s;o mentions the &s;ame &s;ubject, lib. 14. where Eneas wi&s;hes to vi&s;it the gho&s;t of his father.</P>
<P>But what is &s;till more &s;trange, the&s;e unaccountable women by their voice know how to charm the <HI>ammo|dytes,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This creature is from three to five feet long, and perfectly harmle&s;s; it has not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of being hurt <HI>even</HI> by man; while the unparalleled bril|liancy of its colours may be another inducement for the adoration of the negroes.</NOTE> or <HI>papaw</HI> &s;erpent, down from the tree. This is an ab&s;olute fact; nor is this &s;nake ever killed or hurt by the negroes, who, on the contrary, e&s;teem it as their friend and guardian, and are happy to &s;ee it enter their huts. When the&s;e &s;ibyls have charmed or conjured down the ammodytes &s;erpent from the tree, it is common to &s;ee this reptile twine and wreathe about their arms, neck and brea&s;t, as if the creature took delight in hearing her voice, while the woman &s;trokes and care&s;&s;es it with her hand. The &s;acred writers &s;peak of the charming of adders and &s;erpents in many places, which I mention
<PB N="264" REF="305">
only to prove the antiquity of the practice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the 58th P&s;alm, ver. 4, and 5:

And it is not many years &s;ince an Italian woman brought over three tame &s;nakes, which crawled about her neck and arms: they were four or five feet long, but not venomous.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of &s;uper&s;tition among&s;t the negroes I mu&s;t relate; there is a direct prohibition in every family, handed down from father to &s;on, again&s;t the eating of &s;ome one kind of animal food, which they call <HI>treff</HI>; this may be either fowl, fi&s;h, or quadruped, but whatever it is, no negro will touch it; though I have &s;een &s;ome good Catholics eat roa&s;t-beef in Lent, and a reli|gious Jew devouring a &s;lice from a fat flitch of bacon.</P>
<P>However ridiculous &s;ome of the above rites may appear, yet among&s;t the African blacks they are certainly nece&s;|&s;ary, to keep the rabble in &s;ubjection; and their <HI>gadomen</HI> or prie&s;ts know this as well as the infallible Pontiff of the Roman church. The&s;e illiterate mortals differ, how|ever, in this re&s;pect from the modern Europeans, that whatever they believe, they do it firmly, and are never &s;taggered by the doubts of &s;ceptici&s;m, nor troubled with
<PB N="265" REF="306">
the qualms of con&s;cience; but whether they are, upon this account, better or wor&s;e, I will not pretend to determine. &mdash;I however think that they are a happy people, and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much friend&s;hip for one another, that they need not be told to "love their neighbour as them&s;elves;" &s;ince the poore&s;t negro, having only an egg, &s;corns to eat it alone; but were a dozen pre&s;ent, and every one a &s;tranger, he would cut or break it into ju&s;t as many &s;hares; or were there one &s;ingle dram of rum, he would divide it among the &s;ame number: this is not done, however, until a few drops are fir&s;t &s;prinkled on the ground, as an oblation to the gods.&mdash;Approach then here, thou canting hypocrite, and take an example from thy illiterate &s;able brother! &mdash; From what I &s;ometimes throw out, however, let it not be under&s;tood that I am an ene|my to religious wor&s;hip&mdash;God forbid! But I ever will profe&s;s my&s;elf the greate&s;t friend to tho&s;e who&s;e actions be&s;t corre&s;pond with their doctrine; which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, is too &s;eldom the ca&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e nations who pretend mo&s;t to civilization.</P>
<P>If &s;avage nations be commonly generous and faithful, they are not, however, without their dark &s;hades; and among the&s;e, the mo&s;t con&s;picuous is a pronene&s;s to an|ger and revenge. I never knew a negro indeed forgive tho&s;e who had wilfully offended him. The &s;trength of this pa&s;&s;ion can only be equalled by their gratitude; for, among&s;t them, it may be truly &s;aid, that
<Q><PB N="266" REF="307">
<L>"A generous friend&s;hip no cold medium knows,</L>
<L>"But with one love, with one re&s;entment glows."</L></Q>
Their abominable cruelties al&s;o, like tho&s;e of all barba|rous nations, are truly &s;hocking. In the colony of Ber|bic&egrave;, during the late revolt, they made no &s;cruple of cut|ting up their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with child, even in their ma&s;ter's pre&s;ence, with many other &s;avage devices too dreadful to relate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a well-known fact, that a ne|gro, having been ill-treated by the family in which he lived as a &s;ervant, one day took the following de&s;perate revenge:&mdash; The ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s being from home, he, having locked all the doors, at their return pre&s;ented him&s;elf with their three fine children on the platform on the top of the hou&s;e.

Whole e&s;tates, as well as private families, have become the victims of their fury, and experienced their fatal ven|geance, even putting to death &s;cores of their own friends and relations, with the double view of depriving their
<PB N="267" REF="308">
proprietors of their mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The&s;e mon&s;ters are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Wi&s;&s;y-men,</HI> perhaps from <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> or knowing, and by their fatal genius carry de&s;truction to a mo&s;t dreadful length before they are detected.</P>
<P>All barbarous and uneducated people have indi&s;tinct notions of property; nor can we wonder that &s;laves, who in their own per&s;ons &s;uffer the mo&s;t flagrant viola|tion of every right, &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to retaliate. The &s;laves on the plantations are therefore too commonly thieves, plundering whatever they can lay their hands upon with impunity; nor can any bounds be &s;et to their intemperance, e&s;pecially in drinking. I have &s;een a ne|gro girl empty a china-bowl at one draught, containing two bottles of claret, which I had given her by way of experiment, till &s;he could no more &s;tand.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not forget to mention that the <HI>Gango</HI> negroes are &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>anthropophagi</HI> or cannibals, like the Caribbee Indians, in&s;tigated by habitual and implacable revenge. Among&s;t the rebels of this tribe, after the taking of Boucou, &s;ome pots were found on the fire with human fle&s;h; which one of the officers had the curio&s;ity to ta&s;te, and declared it was not inferior to &s;ome kinds of beef or pork.</P>
<P>I have been &s;ince a&s;&s;ured by a Mr. <HI>Vangills,</HI> an Ame|rican, that having travelled for a great number of miles inland in Africa, he at length came to a place where human legs, arms, and thighs hung upon wooden &s;ham|bles,
<PB N="268" REF="309">
and were expo&s;ed to &s;ale, like butchers meat in Leadenhall market. And Captain <HI>John Keene,</HI> formerly of the <HI>Dolphin</HI> cutter, but late of the <HI>Naimbana</HI> &s;chooner, in the Sierra Leona company's &s;ervice, po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured me, that when he, a few years &s;ince, was on the coa&s;t of Africa, in the brig <HI>Fame,</HI> from Bri&s;tol, Mr. Samuel Biggs owner, trading for wood, iron, and gold-du&s;t, a Cap|tain <HI>Dunnigen,</HI> with his whole crew, belonging to the <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> &s;chooner, which was her tender, were cut in pieces, &s;alted, and <HI>eaten</HI> by the negroes of <HI>Great Drewin,</HI> about thirty miles North of the River <HI>St. Andrew's</HI>; who having torn the copper off her bottom, burned the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>But from the&s;e deformities of character I will now re|lieve the attention of the reader, and proceed in ju&s;tice to di&s;pel the gloomy cloud, by introducing the &s;un-&s;hine of their virtues.</P>
<P>Their genius has been already treated of, &s;o has their gratitude; which la&s;t they carry to &s;uch a length, that they will even die for tho&s;e who have &s;hewn them any particular favour. Nothing can exceed the fidelity and attachment they have for tho&s;e ma&s;ters who u&s;e them well, which proves that their affection is as &s;trong as their hatred. Negroes are generally good-natured, particu|larly the <HI>Coromantyn,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Nago.</HI> They are al&s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ion, and jealou&s;y in their brea&s;ts has produced the mo&s;t dreadful effects. The de|licacy of the&s;e people de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be noticed: I do not remember, among&s;t the many thou&s;ands I have
<PB N="269" REF="310">
&s;een during &s;everal years re&s;idence among them, ever to have ob&s;erved even an offer to ki&s;s a woman in public. Maternal tenderne&s;s for their children is al&s;o natural to the females, for in general, during the two years which they u&s;ually &s;uckle them, they never cohabit with their hu&s;bands; this they con&s;ider as unnatural, and preju|dicial to the infants: and the ca&s;e of Le&s;peranza (who bore &s;o many children in a &s;hort time) is no exception, as her children died almo&s;t as &s;oon as they came into the world. The cleanline&s;s of the negro nation is peculiarly remarkable, as they bathe above three times a day. The <HI>Congo</HI> tribe in particular are &s;o fond of the water, that they may, not improperly, be called amphibious ani|mals.</P>
<P>The negroes are likewi&s;e &s;pirited and brave, pa|tient in adver&s;ity, meeting death and torture with the mo&s;t undaunted fortitude. Their conduct, in the mo&s;t trying &s;ituations, approaching even to heroi&s;m; no ne|gro &s;ighs, groans, or complains, though expiring in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding flames. Nor do I remember, upon any occa&s;ion whatever, to have &s;een an African &s;hed a tear, though they beg for mercy with the greate&s;t ear|ne&s;tne&s;s when ordered to be flogged for offences which they are con&s;cious de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed; but if they think their puni&s;hment unmerited, immediate &s;uicide is too often the fatal con&s;equence, e&s;pecially among&s;t the <HI>Coromantyn</HI> negroes, who frequently, during the act of flagellation, throw back their heads in the neck, and
<PB N="270" REF="311">
<HI>&s;wallow their tongue,</HI> which choaks them upon the &s;pot, when they drop dead in the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ters. But when negroes are &s;en&s;ible of having de&s;erved correc|tion, no people can be more humble, or bear their un|happy fate with greater re&s;ignation. The &s;wallowing of the tongue, which they only practi&s;e during the moments of &s;evere di&s;cipline, has of late been prevented in Suri|nam by the <HI>humane</HI> method of holding a fire-brand to the victim's mouth, which an&s;wers the double purpo&s;e of burning his face, and diverting his attention from the exe|cution of his fatal determination.

With &s;ome ma&s;ters their ta&s;ks can never be performed, as they mu&s;t toil on, day and night, even Sundays not excepted.

<PB N="274" REF="315">
This, in frequent in&s;tances, has driven them to di&s;trac|tion, and been the cau&s;e of many murders.</P>
<P>It is in con&s;equence of the&s;e complicated evils, that &s;o many al&s;o de&s;troy them&s;elves by &s;uicide, run away to the woods to join their countrymen in rebellion, or if they &s;tay, grow &s;ad and &s;piritle&s;s, and langui&s;h under di&s;ea&s;es, the effects of bad u&s;age; &s;uch as the <HI>lota,</HI> which is a white &s;corbutic &s;pot that externally covers the body. The <HI>cra&s;&s;y-cra&s;&s;y,</HI> or itch, which with us comes from poorne&s;s of diet, is of cour&s;e very common with them. The <HI>yaws,</HI> a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable di&s;order, by many compared to the ve|nereal di&s;ea&s;e, which renders the patient a &s;hocking &s;pec|tacle, all covered over with yellow ulcers. To this la&s;t-mentioned loath&s;ome malady mo&s;t negroes are &s;ubject, yet but only once in their lives, in which, and being very infectious, it re&s;embles the &s;mall-pox: indeed if a fly which has been feeding upon the di&s;ea&s;ed (and they are generally covered with them) lights upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;cratch on a healthy per&s;on, it communicates this dread|ful di&s;order, which always confines him for &s;everal months. The mo&s;t general cure for the yaws in Suri|nam, is &s;alivation and &s;pare diet, with continual exerci&s;e to promote per&s;piration; and, during this proce&s;s, the poor wretches ab&s;olutely look like decayed carca&s;es.</P>
<P>Still more dreadful is the <HI>boa&s;&s;y,</HI> or <HI>lepro&s;y,</HI> which is deemed incurable: the face and limbs in this complaint &s;well, and the whole body is covered with &s;cales and ul|cers; the breath &s;tinks, the hair falls off, the fingers and
<PB N="275" REF="316">
toes become putrid, and drop away joint after joint. The wor&s;t of which is, that though the di&s;ea&s;e is hopele&s;s, the unhappy &s;ufferer may linger &s;ometimes for many years. The lepers are naturally la&s;civious, and the di&s;ea&s;e being infectious, they are of nece&s;&s;ity &s;eparated from all &s;ociety, and condemned to a perpetual exile in &s;ome remote cor|ner of the plantations.</P>
<P>The <HI>clabba-yaws,</HI> or <HI>tubboes,</HI> is al&s;o a very trouble&s;ome and tedious di&s;order; it occa&s;ions painful &s;ores about the feet, mo&s;tly in the &s;oles, between the &s;kin and the fle&s;h. The u&s;ual remedy in this ca&s;e is, to burn out the morbid part with a red-hot iron, or cut it out with a lancet; and then the warm juice of roa&s;ted limes is introduced into the wound, though with great pain yet with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The African negroes are al&s;o &s;ubject to many &s;pecies of <HI>worms,</HI> both extraneous and internal, owing to the wading much in &s;tagnated waters, and to the crudity of their diet. Of the former &s;pecies is the <HI>Guinea</HI> or <HI>tape-worm,</HI> which breeds between the &s;kin and the fle&s;h, and is &s;ometimes two yards in length, of a &s;hining &s;ilvery co|lour, and not thicker than the &s;econd &s;tring of a ba&s;s|viol. It occa&s;ions dangerous and painful &s;wellings where-ever it in&s;erts it&s;elf, which is mo&s;tly about the legs. The method of cure, is to &s;eize the head of the worm when it appears above the &s;kin, and extract it by winding it gently round a &s;tick or card; this operation cannot be performed with too much caution, for if it breaks, the
<PB N="276" REF="317">
lo&s;s of the limb, or even of life it&s;elf, is frequently the fatal con&s;equence. Some are infe&s;ted with &s;even or eight of the&s;e worms at a time.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e dreadful calamities, peculiar to them|&s;elves, the negroes are &s;ubject to every complaint com|mon to the Europeans; who, in their turn, are not ex|empt in Guiana from the afflicting and dangerous di&s;|tempers I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It is therefore not to be wondered at if many of the plantations are crouded with mi&s;erable objects, left under the care of the <HI>dre&s;&s;y negro</HI> or black &s;urgeon only, who&s;e whole &s;kill con&s;i&s;ts in admini&s;tering a do&s;e of &s;alts, or &s;preading a plai&s;ter. As to the numbers who are exco|riated from their neck to their heel, by con&s;tant whip|ping, they may cure them&s;elves, or do their work with|out a &s;kin, if they think proper.</P>
<P>Thus from accumulated mi&s;eries, &s;ome naturally &s;uc|ceeding from the climate and their poor diet, but more from the inordinate cruelty of <HI>managers,</HI> it mu&s;t follow that numerous &s;laves become unfit for work, many from weakne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, and others from ex|treme labour becoming old before their time. But for all the&s;e evils, this plantation de&s;pot finds an infallible re|medy, which is no other than to put them to death at once: the lo&s;s does not affect him but his ma&s;ter, and he is proud of &s;hewing only &s;uch negroes as are able to do their ta&s;k, a&s;&s;uring the owner that they mo&s;tly died by
<PB N="277" REF="318">
the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; and the word of the human carca&s;e-butcher is quite &s;ufficient, as no negro is allowed to give evidence in any ca&s;e whatever.
<Q>"Dictio te&s;timonii non e&s;t &s;ervo homini."</Q>
Yet &s;hould &s;ome fair European by accident prove the murder, the delinquent e&s;capes, as I have ob&s;erved, by paying a fine of &pound;. 50 and the value of the &s;lave, if the owner requires it; and for this price of blood he may &s;laughter the poor wretches whenever a temporary pa&s;|&s;ion or a habit of cruelty, which is too commonly gene|rated in this &s;ituation, prompts his rage.</P>
<P>They have moreover many &s;tratagems to evade the penalty, &s;hould even the magi&s;trates be pre&s;ent. I have known it happen when one of the&s;e &s;courges of the hu|man race became tired of a negro, that he has taken him out with him a &s;hooting; and ordering him to di&s;cover the game, the fir&s;t bird that &s;tarted he has &s;hot the poor man dead upon the &s;pot. This was called an accident, and no farther enquiry was made concerning it. Others have been di&s;patched by the following method:&mdash;A &s;take being fa&s;tened in the middle of an open plain, the &s;lave is chained to it, and expo&s;ed to the burning &s;un, where one jill of water and a &s;ingle plantain is brought him daily, until he pines to death. But this is not called &s;tarving, as his ma&s;ter declares that he neither wanted victuals nor drink until he expired&mdash;thus he is <HI>honourably</HI> acquitted.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="319">Another plan of murdering with impunity has often been put in practice. The &s;lave is fa&s;tened naked to a tree in the fore&s;t, with his arms and legs extended, under pretence of &s;tretching his limbs; but here he is left, and regularly fed, until he is actually &s;tung to death by the mu&s;quitoes and other in&s;ects&mdash;a mo&s;t infernal puni&s;h|ment, and &s;uch as may be with truth a&s;cribed to the in|&s;tigation of the devil! Drowning them, by kicking them overboard with a weight chained to their legs, is called accidental death. It has been known that by the orders of a <HI>woman,</HI> negro &s;laves have been privately burnt to death, mi&s;erably chained in a &s;urrounding pile of flam|ing faggots. As to the breaking out of their teeth, mere|ly for ta&s;ting the &s;ugar-cane cultivated by them&s;elves, &s;litting up their no&s;es, and cutting off their ears, from private pique, the&s;e are accounted mere &s;port, and not worthy to be mentioned.</P>
<P>By &s;uch inhuman u&s;age this unhappy race of men are &s;ometimes driven to &s;uch a height of de&s;peration, that to fini&s;h their days, and be relieved from wor&s;e than Egyp|tian bondage, &s;ome even have leaped into the caldrons of boiling &s;ugar, thus at once depriving the tyrant of his crop and of his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;ketches can it be a matter of &s;urprize, that armies of rebels are a&s;&s;embled in the fore&s;t, and at every opportunity thir&s;ting for revenge?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this dreadful &s;cene by one general
<PB N="279" REF="320">
remark, &s;hewing how far population is affected by this mo&s;t infamous treatment.</P>
<P>In Surinam there are, upon an average, about 75,000 negro &s;laves, as I have &s;tated; from which if we &s;ubtract children, and &s;uperannuated men and women, there will not be found above 50,000 really fit for labour. There are from &s;ix to twelve Guinea &s;hips, that import from 250 to 300 &s;laves each from Africa annually: we may there|fore compute the yearly importation at an average of 2,500, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply and keep complete the above 50,000; &s;o that the annual deaths exceed the births by the number of 2,500, though each man negro has a wife or two if he chu&s;es, which is, upon the ma&s;s, ju&s;t 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> and con&s;equently proves that the whole race of healthy &s;laves, con&s;i&s;ting of 50,000, are totally extinct once every twenty years.</P>
<P>Truth and ju&s;tice however oblige me to declare, that the inhuman barbarities I have been ju&s;t de&s;cribing are not univer&s;al. Compa&s;&s;ionate Heaven has ordained &s;ome exceptions, as I &s;hall impartially &s;hew, by rever&s;ing the picture: not, like &s;ome writers who have treated this &s;ubject, and carefully concealed the mo&s;t plea&s;ing touches of goodne&s;s and humanity, whil&s;t only the darke&s;t &s;hades have been expo&s;ed to the public eye, but by candidly exhibiting both &s;ides with equal ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion; and it is indeed with plea&s;ure I can affirm, that the negro &s;laves on <HI>&s;ome</HI> e&s;tates are treated, in my opinion, as <HI>men</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="321">
ought to be treated; and this mode of conduct might &s;till be more general, by amending the laws, which ought not corruptly to inve&s;t human nature with what it is certain to abu&s;e&mdash;an authority completely de&s;potic. No ma&s;ter &s;urely ought to be entru&s;ted with the dangerous power of taking away the life of his &s;laves with impu|nity; and it ought to be con&s;idered an equal crime in the eye of the law to kill a negro or a white man, as it is equally murder in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now introduce to the reader's acquaintance a negro family in that &s;tate of tranquil happine&s;s, which they always enjoy under a humane and indulgent ma&s;ter. The figures in the plate are &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the <HI>Loango nation,</HI> by the marks on the man's body, while on his brea&s;t may be &s;een <HI>J. G. S.</HI> in a cypher, by which his owner may a&s;certain his property. He carries a ba&s;ket with &s;mall fi&s;h, and a net upon his head, with a large fi&s;h in his hand, caught by him&s;elf in the river. His wife, who is pregnant, is employed in carrying different kinds of fruit, &s;pinning a thread of cotton upon her di&s;|taff, and comfortably &s;moking her pipe of tobacco. Be|&s;ides all this, &s;he has a boy upon her back, and another playing by her &s;ide. Thus, under a mild ma&s;ter and an hone&s;t over&s;eer, a negro's labour is no more than a healthy exerci&s;e, which ends at the &s;etting-&s;un, and the remaining time is his own, which he employs in hunt|ing, fi&s;hing, cultivating his garden, or making ba&s;kets

and fi&s;h-nets for &s;ale; with this money he buys a hog or two, &s;ometimes fowls or ducks, all which he fattens upon the &s;pontaneous growth of the &s;oil, without ex|pence, and very little trouble, and, in the end, they afford him con&s;iderable profit. Thus plea&s;antly &s;ituated, he is exempt from every anxiety, and pays no taxes, but looks up to his ma&s;ter as the only protector of him and his fa|mily. He adores him, not from fear, but from a con|viction that he is indebted to his goodne&s;s for all the comforts he enjoys. He breathes in a luxurious warm climate, like his own, which renders clothes unnece&s;&s;ary, and he finds him&s;elf more healthy, as well as more at his ea&s;e, by going naked. His hou&s;e he may build after his own fancy. The fore&s;t affords him every nece&s;&s;ary material for the cutting. His bed is a ham|mock, or a mat called <HI>papaya.</HI> His pots he manufactures him&s;elf, and his di&s;hes are gourds, which grow in his garden. He never lives with a wife he does not love, ex|changing for another the moment either he or &s;he be|comes tired, though this &s;eparation happens le&s;s fre|quently here than divorces do in Europe. Be&s;ides the regular allowance given him by his ma&s;ter weekly, his female friend has the art of making many &s;avoury di&s;hes; &s;uch as <HI>braf,</HI> or a hodge-podge of plantains and yams boiled with &s;alt meat, barbacued fi&s;h, and Cayenne pepper. <HI>Tom-tom</HI> is a very good pudding, compo&s;ed of the flour of Indian corn, boiled with fle&s;h,

fowl, fi&s;h, Cayenne pepper, and the young pods of the <HI>ocra</HI> or althea plant. <HI>Pepper-pot</HI> is a di&s;h of boiled fi&s;h and cap&s;icum, eaten with roa&s;ted plantains. <HI>Gangotay</HI> is made of dried, and <HI>afofoo</HI> of green plantains. <HI>Acan&s;a</HI> and <HI>doquenoo</HI> are compo&s;ed of the flour of maize, and the latter is eaten with mola&s;&s;es. His common drink is the limpid &s;tream, &s;ometimes corrected by a little rum. If he is accidentally wounded or indi&s;po&s;ed, he is cured for nothing; but it is very &s;eldom he troubles the faculty, being tolerably &s;killed in herbs and &s;imples, be&s;ides &s;cari|fying and puckering the &s;kin, which &s;erves in&s;tead of bleeding. The inconvenience of vermin he remedies without a comb, by plai&s;tering up his hair with clay, which being dried on the head, and then wa&s;hed with &s;oap and water, makes him clean beyond conception; his teeth are con&s;tantly kept as white as ivory; for this purpo&s;e he u&s;es nothing but a &s;prig of orange-tree, bitten at one end, until the fibres re&s;emble a &s;mall bru&s;h; and no negro, male or female, is to be &s;een without this little in&s;tru|ment, which has be&s;ides the virtue of &s;weetening the breath.</P>
<P>So much for his body; and with regard to his <HI>&s;oul,</HI> it is &s;eldom troubled with any qualms of con&s;cience, or fear of death, as I have &s;tated, being firm and un&s;haken in what he was taught to believe, which is indeed little, but plain; and when he is no more, his companions or rela|tions carry him to &s;ome grove of orange-trees, where he
<PB N="283" REF="327">
is not interred without expence, being generally put in a coffin of the very be&s;t wood and workman&s;hip, while the cries and lamentations of his &s;urviving friends, who &s;ing a dirge, pierce the &s;ky. The grave being filled up, and a green turf neatly &s;pread over it, a couple of large gourds are put by the &s;ide, the one with water, the other with boiled fowls, pork, ca&s;&s;ava, &amp;c. as a libation, not from a &s;uper&s;titious notion, as &s;ome believe, that he will eat or drink it, but as a te&s;timony of that regard which they have for his memory and a&s;hes; while &s;ome even add the little furniture that he left behind, breaking it in pieces over the grave. This done, every one takes his la&s;t farewell, &s;peaking to him as if alive, and te&s;tifying their &s;orrow at his departure; adding, that they hope to &s;ee him, not in <HI>Guinea,</HI> as &s;ome have written, but in that better place, where he now enjoys the plea&s;ant company of his parents, friends, and ance&s;tors; when another di&s;|mal yell ends the ceremony, and all return home. Next a fat hog being killed, with fowls, ducks, &amp;c. a general fea&s;t is given by his friends to all the other negroes, which concludes not till the following day. The neare&s;t connections and relations of the decea&s;ed, both male and female, now cut their hair <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told Job did the &s;ame.</NOTE> and &s;have their heads, round which having tied a dark blue handkerchief, they wear this mourning for a whole year; after which, once more vi&s;iting the grave, they offer a la&s;t libation, and taking their final farewell, another hog and fowls being killed,
<PB N="284" REF="328">
the funeral rites are quite ended by a &s;econd fea&s;t, which fini&s;hes with a joyful dance, and &s;ongs in memory and prai&s;e of their dear departed friend or relation.</P>
<P>No people can more e&s;teem or have a greater friend|&s;hip for one another than the negro &s;laves; they appear to have unbounded enjoyment in each other's company, and are not de&s;titute of &s;ocial amu&s;ements, &s;uch as the <HI>&s;oe&s;a,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in footing oppo&s;ite to each other, and clapping with their hands upon their &s;ides to keep in time. So very eager are they at this animating play, in which &s;ometimes &s;ix or eight couple are engaged at once, that the violent exerci&s;e having been known to kill &s;ome of the negroes, it is forbidden by the magi&s;trates at Pa|ramaribo. <HI>Awaree</HI> is an innocent amu&s;ement, con&s;i&s;ting in pitching with a large kind of marbles, in defect of which they u&s;e the awaree nuts or large pebbles.</P>

<P>Their in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, which are not a little in|genious, are all made by them&s;elves, and con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e repre&s;ented in the annexed plate; where</P>
<P>N^o 1, which is called <HI>qua-qua,</HI> is a hard &s;ounding-board, elevated on one &s;ide like a boot-jack, on which they beat time as on a drum, with two pieces of iron, or two bones.</P>
<P>N^o 2, is the <HI>kiemba-toetoe,</HI> or hollow reed, which is blown through the no&s;trils, like the na&s;al flute of Ota|heite: it has but two holes, one at each end, the one &s;erving to &s;ound it, the other to be touched by the finger.</P>
<P>N^o 3, is the <HI>An&s;okko-baina,</HI> which is a hard board, &s;up|ported on both &s;ides like a low &s;eat, on which are placed &s;mall blocks of different &s;izes, which being &s;truck with two &s;mall &s;ticks like a dulcimer, give different &s;ounds, that are not at all di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>N^o 4, is the <HI>great Creole drum,</HI> being a hollow tree, open at one end, and covered at the other with a &s;heep-&s;kin, on which they &s;it a&s;tride, and &s;o beat time with the palms of their hands; an&s;wering the effect of a ba&s;s-viol to the <HI>qua-qua</HI> board.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="330">N^o 5, is the <HI>great Loango drum,</HI> being covered at both ends, and &s;erves the &s;ame purpo&s;e as a ba&s;s drum.</P>
<P>N^o 6, is the <HI>Papa drum,</HI> beaten as the others.</P>
<P>N^o 7, is the <HI>&s;mall Loango drum,</HI> beaten together with the great one.</P>
<P>N^o 8, the <HI>&s;mall Creole drum,</HI> for the &s;ame u&s;e.</P>
<P>N^o 9, is called <HI>coeroema</HI>; this is a wooden cup, inge|niou&s;ly made, covered al&s;o with a &s;heep-&s;kin, and beaten with two &s;mall rods or drum-&s;ticks, after the manner of the <HI>qua-qua</HI> board.</P>
<P>N^o 10, is the <HI>Loango-bania.</HI> This I thought exceedingly curious, being a dry board, on which are laced, and kept down by a tran&s;ver&s;e bar, different &s;ized ela&s;tic &s;plinters of the palm-tree, like pieces of whalebone, in &s;uch a manner that both ends are elevated by two other bars that are fixed under them; and the above apparatus being placed on</P>
<P>N^o 11, which is a large empty <HI>calleba&s;h</HI> to promote the &s;ound; the extremities of the &s;plinters are &s;napt by the &s;ingers, &s;omething in the manner of a piano-forte, when the mu&s;ic has a &s;oft and very plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>N^o 12, is called by the negroes <HI>&s;aka-&s;aka,</HI> being a hol|low gourd, with a &s;tick and handle fixed through it, and filled with &s;mall pebbles and pea&s;e, not unlike the magic &s;hell of the Indians. This they hold above their heads, and while they dance rattle it to mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>N^o 13, is a <HI>conch,</HI> or &s;ea-&s;hell, which by blowing they

<P>N^o 14, is called <HI>benta,</HI> being a branch bent like a bow by means of a &s;lip of dry reed or warimbo; which cord, when held to the teeth, is beaten with a &s;hort &s;tick, and by being &s;hifted backwards and forwards &s;ounds not un|like a jew's-harp.</P>
<P>N^o 15, is the <HI>Creole-bania,</HI> this is like a mandoline or guitar, being made of a half gourd covered with a &s;heep-&s;kin, to which is fixed a very long neck or handle. This in&s;trument has but four &s;trings, three long and one &s;hort, which is thick, and &s;erves for a ba&s;s; it is played by the fingers, and has a very agreeable &s;ound, but more &s;o when accompanied by a &s;ong.</P>
<P>N^o 16, is the <HI>trumpet of war,</HI> to command advancing, retreating, &amp;c. and is called by the negroes the <HI>too-too.</HI></P>
<P>N^o 17, is a <HI>horn</HI> u&s;ed to &s;upply the place of the other, or on the plantations to call the &s;laves to work.</P>
<P>N^o 18, is the <HI>Loango too-too</HI> or flute, which they blow as the Europeans do, after the common way. It has but four holes for the fingers, and yet they make it produce a variety of &s;ounds.&mdash;Such are the mu&s;ical in&s;truments of our African brethren, to which they dance with more &s;pirit than we do to the be&s;t band in Europe.</P>
<P>To what I have &s;tated, I will only add, that they always u&s;e full or half mea&s;ure, but never triple time, in their dancing mu&s;ic, which is not unlike that of a baker's

bunt, when he &s;eparates the flour from the bran, &s;ound|ing <HI>tuckety-tuck</HI> and <HI>tuckety-tuck</HI> ad perpetuum. To this noi&s;e they dance with uncommon plea&s;ure, and mo&s;t times foot it away with great art and dexterity.</P>
<Q>"Saltantes &s;atiros imitabitur Alphi&s;iboeus."</Q>
<P>Every Saturday evening, the &s;laves who are well treated clo&s;e the week with an entertainment of this kind, and generally once a quarter are indulged with a grand ball, to which the neighbouring &s;laves are invited; the ma&s;ter often contributing to their happine&s;s by his pre|&s;ence, or at lea&s;t by &s;ending them a pre&s;ent of a few jugs of new rum.</P>
<P>At the&s;e grand balls the &s;laves are remarkably neat, the women appearing in their be&s;t chintz petticoats, and many of the men in fine Holland trow&s;ers. So indefati|gable are they at this diver&s;ion, that I have known the drums continue beating without intermi&s;&s;ion from &s;ix o'clock on Saturday night till the &s;un made its appear|ance on the Monday morning; thus had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix-and-thirty hours in dancing, cheering, hallooing, and clap|ping of hands. The negroes dance always in couples, the men figuring and footing, while the women turn round like a top, their petticoats expanding like an um|brella; and this they call <HI>waey-cotto.</HI> During this, the by-&s;tanding youths fill about the liquor, while the girls encourage the performance, and wipe the &s;weat from the brows and &s;ides of the unwearied mu&s;icians.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="336">It is indeed upon the whole a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee with what good-nature and even good-manners the&s;e dancing &s;ocieties are kept up, of which I repeat it they are &s;o fond, that I have known a newly-imported negro, for want of a partner, figure and foot it for nearly the &s;pace of two hours, to his &s;hadow again&s;t the wall.</P>
<P>If to what I have &s;tated relative to negro &s;laves, when under a candid and humane ma&s;ter, we further add, their never being &s;eparated from each other; parents &s;eeing their children around them, &s;ometimes till the third and fourth generation, be&s;ides the confidence that they are all provided for to the end of their lives;&mdash;then if we draw the compari&s;on between this cla&s;s of people, and the num|berle&s;s wretched objects that di&s;grace the &s;treets of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> we can a&s;&s;uredly not call tho&s;e Africans who fall under the above de&s;cription&mdash;<HI>unhappy.</HI></P>
<P>And now, to &s;um up all I have to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of &s;laves in the fewe&s;t words, for the &s;ake of the reader, and al&s;o for my own, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem to contradict my&s;elf, by having &s;o frequently animadverted on the &s;hocking cruelties of &s;ome ma&s;ters, and occa&s;ionally done ju&s;tice to the humane and liberal di&s;po&s;itions of others, I beg leave to &s;ay one word more on the projected <HI>abo|lition.</HI>&mdash;Could we per&s;uade all our commercial neigh|bours to join in <HI>that</HI> mea&s;ure, the ca&s;e would be different: but &s;ince I have &s;een cruelties exerci&s;ed &s;o commonly in Surinam, which I never heard of in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, and from my certain ob&s;ervation have declared the &s;oil

<P>Such is indeed the love and confidence of &s;ome planters for their &s;laves, that they often entru&s;t their infants to a negro wet-nur&s;e, in preference to an European, where both may be had; and &s;uch the attachment of &s;ome &s;laves to their ma&s;ters, that I have known many refu&s;e to accept of their emancipation, and even &s;ome, who had their liberty, voluntarily return to dependence.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive defeats and re|peated di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the rebels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVII.</NOTE> news was brought to Paramaribo, on the 12th of Augu&s;t, that they had fallen upon the e&s;tate <HI>Bergendal,</HI> or the <HI>Blue Bergh,</HI> which is al&s;o called Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;ituated in the higher parts of the River Surinam, and carried away all the black women, although a military po&s;t was &s;tationed near the above place, but without committing any kind of cruelty, as too generally had been their cu&s;tom. Upon this intelligence a party of the rangers was in&s;tantly detached thither to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pur&s;uing them; and about this &s;ame time the long-projected <HI>cordon,</HI> or path of circumvallation round the colony, was al&s;o began to be cut, by &s;even hundred negro &s;laves; which path was henceforth to be manned with military piquets at proper di&s;tances, to defend the e&s;tates again&s;t any farther inva&s;ions from without, and to pre|vent de&s;ertion to the enemy from within.</P>
<P>Mount Parna&s;&s;us, which was the &s;cene of the late <HI>rape of the Sabines,</HI> is &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of the River
<PB N="292" REF="339">
Surinam, di&s;tant from Paramaribo, if we include the windings of the river, above one hundred miles; and as the &s;ituation is plea&s;ant, I pre&s;ent the reader with a view of it, in the plate annexed, as al&s;o of the village, called the <HI>Jews Savannah,</HI> which is di&s;tant from town, in a &s;traight line, &s;omething more than forty, but by water above &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles. Here the Jews have a beautiful &s;y|nagogue, and keep their &s;olemn fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals; here they al&s;o have their capital &s;chools and &s;eminaries, for at this village re&s;ide &s;ome very re&s;pectable Jewi&s;h families. The&s;e people po&s;&s;e&s;s particular rights and privileges in this colony, with which they were endowed by King Charles the Second, when the &s;ettlement of Surinam was Engli&s;h; and &s;uch are the&s;e privileges I never knew Jews to po&s;&s;e&s;s in any other part of the world whatever.</P>
<P>From Paramaribo, or rather from the fortre&s;s New Am&s;terdam, the River Surinam, like tho&s;e of Cottica and Comawina, is beautifully bordered with &s;ugar and coffee plantations, as are al&s;o &s;everal creeks or &s;mall rivers that communicate with it; &s;uch as the <HI>Pawlus,</HI> the <HI>Para,</HI> the <HI>Cropina,</HI> and the <HI>Pararac</HI> creeks; but above Mount Par|na&s;&s;us not a &s;ingle e&s;tate, that may be &s;o called, is to be found; neither is the river any longer navigable, even for &s;mall craft, on account of the prodigious rocks, and ca&s;cades or water-falls, with which it is ob&s;tructed as it winds through exce&s;&s;ively high mountains and an im|penetrable fore&s;t. While therefore they form an enchant|ingly romantic &s;cene to the eye, the&s;e natural bulwarks

prevent the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the colony from making &s;uch di&s;coveries as might perhaps reward their labour with very con&s;iderable riches.</P>
<P>If, as I have ju&s;t mentioned, cruelties were become le&s;s common in the rivers by the rebels, barbarities &s;till con|tinued in a &s;hocking degree in the metropolis; where my ears were deafened with the clang of the whip, and the &s;hrieks of the negroes. Among the mo&s;t eminent of the&s;e tyrants was a Mi&s;s Sp&mdash;n, who lived next door to Mr. de Graav, and who I &s;aw with horror from my window give orders that a young black woman &s;hould be flogged principally acro&s;s the brea&s;ts, at which &s;he &s;eemed to enjoy peculiar &s;atisfaction. To di&s;&s;ipate the im|pre&s;&s;ion this &s;cene had left on my mind, I got into a whi&s;key, and rode out; when the fir&s;t thing I &s;aw was a negro girl fall naked from a garret window on a heap of broken bottles: this was indeed an accident, but &s;he was &s;o mangled, though not dead, that &s;he exhibited a &s;pecta|cle nearly as wretched as the other.&mdash;Cur&s;ing my unlucky fate, I turned the hor&s;es, and drove to the beach, as the only place to avoid every &s;cene of cruelty and mi&s;ery; but here I had the mortification to &s;ee two Philadelphia &s;ailors (while they were fighting on the foreca&s;tle of their ve&s;&s;el) both fall over the &s;hip's bow into the &s;tream, where they &s;unk, and were no more &s;een. On board another Ame|rican brig, I di&s;covered a little tar defending him&s;elf from the cro&s;s-trees with a hatchet, again&s;t a &s;erjeant and four armed men, for a con&s;iderable time; till they threatening
<PB N="294" REF="342">
to &s;hoot him out of the rigging, he at la&s;t &s;urrendered, and being brought a&s;hore, was dragged to fort Zelandia, in company with two others, by a file of mu&s;keteers, where, for having been drunk on duty, they received a <HI>fire-cant</HI> each, at the captain's reque&s;t; that is, they were ba&s;tinadoed or beaten on the &s;houlders by two corporals with bamboo canes, till their backs were black, and &s;welled like a cu&s;hion. However arbitrary this mode of correction, the captain endeavoured to explain the nece&s;&s;ity of it; the private American &s;ailors being of a turbulent &s;pirit indeed when drunk, although when &s;ober they may be fairly cla&s;&s;ed among the be&s;t &s;eamen in the world.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, while mu&s;ing on all the dif|ferent dangers and cha&s;ti&s;ements to which the lower cla&s;s of people are expo&s;ed, I heard a crowd pa&s;s under my window. Curio&s;ity made me &s;tart up, dre&s;s in a hurry, and follow them: when I di&s;covered three ne|groes in chains, &s;urrounded by a guard, going to be exe|cuted in the &s;avannah. Their undaunted look, however aver&s;e I may be to the fight of cruelties, &s;o attracted my attention, as to determine me to &s;ee the re&s;ult, which was thus:&mdash;The &s;entence being read in Low Dutch (which they did not under&s;tand) one was condemned to be flogged below the gallows, and his accomplice to have his head &s;truck off with an ax, for having &s;hot a &s;lave who had come to &s;teal plantains on the e&s;tate of his mi&s;|tre&s;s. The truth however was, that this had been done by that lady's ab&s;olute command; but the murder being
<PB N="295" REF="343">
di&s;covered, &s;he, in the hopes of &s;aving her character, be|&s;ides the expence of paying the penalties, gave up her valuable &s;lave, and permitted the unhappy man to be thus &s;acrificed. He laid his head upon the block with great indifference, &s;tretching out his neck; when, with one blow of the ax, it was &s;evered from his body.</P>
<P>The third negro, who&s;e name was <HI>Neptune,</HI> was no &s;lave, but his own ma&s;ter, and a carpenter by trade; he was young and hand&s;ome, but having killed the over|&s;eer of the e&s;tate <HI>Altona,</HI> in the Para Creek, in con&s;e|quence of &s;ome di&s;pute, he <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> forfeited his life. The particulars, however, are worth relating: This man having &s;tolen a &s;heep, to entertain a favourite young woman, the over&s;eer, who burnt with jealou&s;y, had determined to &s;ee him hanged; to prevent which, the negro &s;hot him dead among the &s;ugar-canes; for the&s;e offences of cour&s;e he was &s;entenced to be <HI>broken alive upon the rack,</HI> with|out the benefit of the <HI>coup de grace</HI> or mercy-&s;troke. Informed of the dreadful &s;entence, he compo&s;edly laid him&s;elf down on his back on a &s;trong cro&s;s, on which, with arms and legs expanded, he was fa&s;tened by ropes: the executioner, al&s;o a black man, having now with a hatchet chopped off his left hand, next took up a heavy iron bar, with which, by repeated blows, he broke his bones to &s;hivers, till the marrow, blood, and &s;plinters flew about the field; but the pri&s;oner never uttered a groan nor a &s;igh. The ropes being next unla&s;hed, I ima|gined him dead, and felt happy; till the magi&s;trates
<PB N="296" REF="344">
&s;tirring to depart, he writhed him&s;elf from the cro&s;s, when he fell on the gra&s;s, and damned them all, as a &s;et of barbarous ra&s;cals; at the &s;ame time removing his right hand by the help of his teeth, he re&s;ted his head on part of the timber, and a&s;ked the by-&s;tanders for a pipe of tobacco, which was infamou&s;ly an&s;wered by kicking and &s;pitting on him; till I, with &s;ome American &s;eamen, thought proper to prevent it. He then begged that his head might be chopped off; but to no purpo&s;e. At la&s;t, &s;eeing no end to his mi&s;ery, he declared,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that though he had de&s;erved death, he had not expected to die &s;o many deaths: however, (&s;aid he) you chri&s;tians have mi&s;&s;ed your aim at la&s;t, and I now care not, were I to remain thus one month longer."</Q>
After which he &s;ung two extempore &s;ongs (with a clear voice) the &s;ubjects of which were, to bid adieu to his living friends, and to acquaint his decea&s;ed relations that in a very little time he &s;hould be with them, to enjoy their company for ever in a better place. This done, he calmly entered into conver&s;ation with &s;ome gentlemen concerning his trial; relating every particular with uncommon tranquillity&mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But," &s;aid he abruptly,
"by the &s;un it mu&s;t be eight o'clock; and by any longer di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hould be &s;orry to be the cau&s;e of your lo&s;ing your breakfa&s;t."</Q>
Then, ca&s;ting his eyes on a Jew, who&s;e name was <HI>De Vries,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A-propos, &s;ir," &s;aid he,
"won't you plea&s;e to pay me the ten &s;hillings you owe me?"</Q>

Which &s;peech, on &s;eeing the Jew &s;tare like a fool, this mangled wretch accompanied with a loud and hearty laugh. Next, ob&s;erving the &s;oldier that &s;tood &s;entinel over him biting occa&s;ionally on a piece of dry bread, he a&s;ked him
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how it came to pa&s;s, that he, a <HI>white man,</HI> &s;hould have no meat to eat along with it?"</Q>
&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I am not &s;o rich,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;oldier. &mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then I will make you a pre&s;ent, &s;ir," &s;aid the negro;
"fir&s;t, pick my hand that was chopped off clean to the bones, next begin to devour my body, till you are glutted; when you will have both bread and meat, as be&s;t becomes you;"</Q>
&mdash;which piece of humour was followed by a &s;econd laugh; and thus he continued, until I left him, which was about three hours after the dread|ful execution.</P>
<P>Wonderful it is indeed, that human nature &s;hould be able to endure &s;o much torture, which a&s;&s;uredly could only be &s;upported by a mixture of rage, contempt, pride, and the glory of braving his tormentors, from whom he was &s;o &s;oon to e&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Demerary, &s;o late as October, 1789, thirty-two wretches were executed in three days, &s;ixteen of whom &s;uffered in the manner ju&s;t de&s;cribed, with no le&s;s fortitude, and without uttering one &s;ingle complaint.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though I never recal to my remembrance, without the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ation, this horrid &s;cene, which mu&s;t revolt the feelings of all who have one &s;park of huma|nity, I cannot forbear exhibiting to the public the dread|ful &s;pectacle in the annexed drawing. If the reader,

<P>I mu&s;t now relate an incident, which, as it had a mo|mentary effect on my imagination, might have had a la&s;t|ing one on &s;ome who had not inve&s;tigated the real cau&s;e of it, and which it gave me no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to di&s;cover.

who perched upon it, as if he meant to di&s;pute with me for this fea&s;t of carrion; which bird, having already picked out one of the eyes, had fled at my fir&s;t approach, and &s;triking the &s;kull with his talons, as he took his &s;udden flight, occa&s;ioned the motion already de&s;cribed. I &s;hall now only add, that this poor wretch, after living near &s;ix hours, had been knocked on the head by the com|mi&s;erating &s;entinel, the marks of who&s;e mu&s;ket were perfectly vi&s;ible by a large open fracture in the &s;kull.</P>
<P><HI>Vultures</HI> are compared by &s;ome to the eagle, though tho&s;e of Surinam po&s;&s;e&s;s very oppo&s;ite qualities. They are indeed birds of prey, but in&s;tead of feeding on what they kill, like the other noble animal, their chief pur|&s;uit is carrion; wherefore they generally re&s;ort to burial-grounds and places of execution, which they di&s;cover by their very acute &s;mell, &s;o much &s;o, that by the negroes they are called <HI>tingee-fowlo,</HI> or the &s;tinking bird. The Guiana vultures are the &s;ize of a common turkey; they are of a dark-grey colour, with black wings and tail; the bill is &s;traight with a crooked point, and very &s;trong; the tongue is cloven, the neck without feathers, and the legs very &s;hort. Be&s;ides carrion, the&s;e birds will often de&s;troy and eat &s;erpents, and indeed every thing that comes in their way, until they are &s;o much gorged that they can hardly fly.</P>
<P>The bird called the <HI>king of the vultures</HI> is not very common in Surinam, though &s;ometimes the Indians bring one or two to Paramaribo for &s;ale, on account of its great
<PB N="300" REF="349">
beauty. This is larger than any turkey-cock, with a naked head and neck, the &s;kin of which is partly brown, yellow, and &s;carlet: round its neck it has a du&s;ky, long, feathered collar, in which it can at plea&s;ure withdraw, and &s;o far hide its neck, that nothing but part of the head is perceptible. This bird likewi&s;e feeds on carrion, &s;erpents, rats, toads, and even excrements.</P>
<P>Among the other birds of prey in the fore&s;t of Surinam, is found the <HI>cre&s;ted eagle.</HI> This is a very fierce bird, and al&s;o very &s;trong; the back is black, but yellowi&s;h at the ba&s;e; the brea&s;t and belly white, with black &s;pots, as are its thighs, and even the feathers of its legs; the re&s;t of the body is entirely brown, and the claws perfectly yel|low. The head of this bird is flat, ornamented with four feathers, two long and two &s;hort, which it can erect or depre&s;s at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Hind,</HI> an Engli&s;h frigate, with her tender, were on the coa&s;t, looking out for American prizes.</P>
<P>The 24th, being the Prince of Orange's birth-day, the whole corps of officers were entertained with &s;alt beef, &s;alt pork, barley puddings, and hard pea&s;e, by Colonel Fourgeoud. And this day (poor Joanna being inflexible in her re&s;olutions) I ratified the agreement with the good Mrs. Godefroy, in pre&s;ence of her mother and other re|lations, whereby the above lady bound her&s;elf
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"never to part with her, except to my&s;elf alone, as long as &s;he liv|ed; and that upon her death, not only her full liberty,
<PB N="301" REF="350">
but a &s;pot of ground for cultivation, be&s;ides a neat hou&s;e built upon it, &s;hould be her portion for ever, to di&s;po&s;e of as &s;he plea&s;ed."</Q>
After this &s;he returned my remaining bond of 900 florins, and gave Joanna a pur&s;e with gold containing near twenty ducats, be&s;ides a couple of pieces of Ea&s;t India chintz, advi&s;ing me at the &s;ame time
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to give in a reque&s;t to the court for little Johnny's imme|diate manumi&s;&s;ion; which,"
&s;he ob&s;erved,
"was a ne|ce&s;&s;ary form, whether I &s;hould be able to obtain the bail u&s;ually required or not; and without which formality, even if I had the bail ready to appear, nothing would be done in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Having both of us thanked this mo&s;t excellent woman, I went to &s;up with the Governor, where being tran&s;|ported with joy, I gave him my reque&s;t in full form, which he coolly put in his pocket with one hand, while he gave me a hearty &s;queeze with the other; and &s;haking his head, told me frankly,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he would lay it before the court; but at the &s;ame time was perfectly con|vinced my boy mu&s;t die a &s;lave, unle&s;s I could find the nece&s;&s;ary bail, which he was at the &s;ame time well per|&s;uaded very few people would wi&s;h to appear for."</Q>
Thus, after &s;pending &s;o much time and labour, be&s;ides the expence of above a hundred guineas already paid, I had &s;till the inexpre&s;&s;ible mortification to &s;ee this dear little fellow, of whom I was both the father and the ma&s;ter, expo&s;ed to perhaps eternal &s;ervitude; as for Joanna, &s;he was now perfectly &s;afe, to my heartfelt &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="351">One con&s;olation, however, in the mid&s;t of this di&s;ap|pointment, mo&s;t opportunely pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The fa|mous negro, <HI>Graman-Qwacy,</HI> formerly mentioned, who was ju&s;t returned from Holland, brought the news, that partly by <HI>his</HI> intere&s;t a new law was there enacted, by which all &s;laves were to be free &s;ix months after their landing at the Texel; which, indeed, on application of their ma&s;ters, might be extended to twelve, but not a &s;ingle day longer on any account what&s;oever.&mdash;Thus be|ing per&s;uaded that I &s;hould <HI>one day</HI> joyfully carry both him and his mother over the Atlantic, my heart was greatly relieved.</P>
<P>Of this Graman-Qwacy I will beg leave to give a &s;hort account, before I take farewell of the reader. Suffice it for the pre&s;ent to &s;ay, that the Prince of Orange, be&s;ides paying his out and homeward pa&s;&s;age, and giving him &s;everal pre&s;ents, &s;ent him back to Surinam dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of blue and &s;carlet, trimmed over with broad gold lace: on his hat he wore a white feather, and looked upon the whole not unlike one of the Dutch generals; which goodne&s;s made this king of the negroes, however, very proud, and even frequently very &s;aucy.</P>
<P>On the 25th, the Governor of the colony gave a very &s;umptuous fea&s;t to &s;everal of his friends at his <HI>indigo-plantation,</HI> which was &s;ituated but a few miles at the back of his palace, where I had the honour to be invited as one of the party, and had the plea&s;ure of in&s;pecting the
<PB N="303" REF="352">
proce&s;s of making <HI>indigo,</HI> a detail of which will probably be acceptable.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, therefore, I &s;hall pre&s;ent the curious with a drawing of the <HI>indigo plant,</HI> which is a knotty &s;hrub produced from &s;eed, which grows to about two feet from the ground, and comes to perfection in the &s;pace of two months. This plant requires a very rich &s;oil, which be&s;ides ought to be kept perfectly clean from weeds. In the plate, <HI>A</HI> is the colour of the &s;prig; <HI>B,</HI> the leaves above; <HI>C,</HI> the &s;ame below; <HI>D,</HI> the &s;eed inclo&s;ed in &s;mall brown pods; <HI>E,</HI> the &s;ize of the leaf as it grows; <HI>F,</HI> a piece of indigo ready made for u&s;e. The above &s;prig was de&s;igned from nature on the &s;pot, but on a &s;mall &s;cale: it has &s;omething the appearance of the tamarind branch, principally in the &s;ize of the leaf, which al&s;o grows in pairs, and is darker above than below; but at the extremity of each &s;hoot in <HI>this</HI> &s;hrub, one leaf grows &s;ingle, which is not the ca&s;e in the other. The young &s;hoot in the tamarind-trees al&s;o appears at the extremity of the branches; but in this they &s;pring forth, as may be &s;een, from the ba&s;e.</P>
<P>The mode in which this plant is converted into in|digo is as follows: &mdash;When all the verdure is cut off, the whole crop is tied in bunches, and put into a very large tub with water, covered over with very heavy logs of wood by way of pre&s;&s;ers: thus kept, it be|gins to ferment; in le&s;s than eighteen hours the water &s;eems to boil, and becomes of a violet or garter blue co|lour, extracting all the grain or colouring matter from
<PB N="304" REF="353">
the plant: in this &s;ituation the liquor is drawn off into another tub, which is &s;omething le&s;s, when the remain|ing tra&s;h is carefully picked up and thrown away; and the very noxious &s;mell of this refu&s;e it is that occa&s;ions the peculiar unhealthine&s;s which is always incident to this bu&s;ine&s;s. Being now in the &s;econd tub, the ma&s;h is agitated by paddles adapted for the purpo&s;e, till by a &s;kilful maceration all the grain &s;eparates from the water, the fir&s;t &s;inking like mud to the bottom, while the latter appears clear and tran&s;parent on the &s;urface: this water, being carefully removed till near the coloured ma&s;s, the remaining liquor is drawn off into a third tub, to let what indigo <HI>it</HI> may contain al&s;o &s;ettle in the bottom; after which, the la&s;t drops of water here being al&s;o re|moved, the &s;ediment or <HI>indigo</HI> is put into proper ve&s;&s;els to dry, where being dive&s;ted of its la&s;t remaining moi&s;|ture, and formed into &s;mall, round, and oblong &s;quare pieces, it is become a beautiful dark blue, and fit for ex|portation. The be&s;t indigo ought to be light, hard, and &s;parkling. In Surinam but little of it is cultivated, for what rea&s;on I know not, &s;ince one pound is &s;old for about four florins, which is about &s;even &s;hillings in &s;ter|ling money.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid this article was fir&s;t introduced by one <HI>De&s;trades,</HI> who called him&s;elf a French officer, and mu&s;t have brought it from the i&s;land of St. Domingo very lately, &s;ince I my&s;elf was well acquainted with this poor fellow, who &s;ince &s;hot him&s;elf through the head with a pi&s;tol at Demerary.&mdash;As the circum&s;tances of his

death were &s;omewhat remarkable, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of relating them. Having involved him&s;elf in debt, he turned to ready money his remaining effects, and fled from Surinam: next &s;etting up in the Spani&s;h contraband trade, his all was taken. Deprived of every thing, he now applied for protection to a friend at De|merary, who humanely gave him &s;helter: at this time an ab&s;ce&s;s gathering in his &s;houlder, every a&s;&s;i&s;tance was offered, but in vain, Mr. De&s;trades refu&s;ing to let it be even examined; his &s;houlder therefore grew wor&s;e, and even dangerous, but he per&s;i&s;ted in not permitting it to be uncovered; till one day, having dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his be&s;t apparel, the family was alarmed by the report of fire-arms, when they found him weltering in his blood, with a pi&s;tol by his &s;ide; and then, to their &s;urprize, hav|ing &s;tripped him, the mark of <HI>V.</HI> for <HI>voleur,</HI> or thief, was di&s;covered on the very &s;houlder he had attempted to con|ceal.&mdash;Thus ended the life of this poor wretch, who had for years at Paramaribo &s;upported the character of a polite and well-bred gentleman, where he had indeed been univer&s;ally re&s;pected.</P>
<P>Dinner being over at the Governor's indigo-plantation, I now departed in his excellency's coach to the water-&s;ide, where a tent-barge and eight oars lay in waiting to row me down to the e&s;tate <HI>Catwyk,</HI> in the River Come|wina, whither I was invited by Mr. <HI>Goetzee,</HI> a Dutch naval officer, who was the proprietor of this beautiful country-&s;eat. In this charming &s;ituation, no amu&s;ements
<PB N="306" REF="356">
were wanting. There were carriages, &s;addle-hor&s;es, &s;ail-boats, billiard-tables, &amp;c. all ready for immediate u&s;e. But what embittered the plea&s;ure was, the inhu|man di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Goetzee's <HI>lady,</HI> who flogged her negro &s;laves for every little trifle. For in&s;tance, one of the foot-boys, called <HI>Jacky,</HI> not having rin&s;ed the gla&s;&s;es according to her mind, &s;he ordered him to be whipped the next morning; but the unfortunate youth &s;oon put him&s;elf beyond the reach of her re&s;entment: for, having taken farewell of the other negroes on the e&s;tate, he went up &s;tairs, laid him&s;elf down upon his <HI>ma&s;ter's</HI> own bed, where, placing the muzzle of a loaded fowling-piece in his mouth, by the help of his toe he drew the trigger, and put an end to his exi&s;tence. A couple of &s;tout ne|groes were now &s;ent up to &s;ee what was the matter; who, finding the bed all over be&s;pattered with blood and brains, got orders to throw the body out of the window to the dogs, while the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were &s;o very much alarmed, that they never got the better of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above unhappy people were poi&s;oned by their &s;laves about &s;ix years after this happened.</NOTE>; nor would any per&s;on con&s;ent to lie in the &s;ame apartment, till I cho&s;e it in preference to any other, being a&s;&s;uredly the mo&s;t plea&s;ant room, and the very be&s;t bed, in the hou&s;e. What added much to the alarm of the family, was the circum&s;tance of a favourite child lying fa&s;t a&s;leep in the &s;ame apartment where this &s;hocking cata|&s;trophe happened. They were, however, relieved from
<PB N="307" REF="357">
their alarms on this &s;core, by being informed that it had not received the &s;malle&s;t injury.</P>
<P>I had not been fourteen days on this plantation, when a female mulatto &s;lave, called <HI>Yettee,</HI> for having joco&s;ely &s;aid "her mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;ome debt as well as her&s;elf," was &s;tripped &s;tark naked, and in a very indecent as well as inhuman manner flogged by two &s;tout negroes before the dwelling-hou&s;e door (while both her feet were locked to a heavy iron bolt) until hardly any &s;kin was left on her thighs or &s;ides. Five days after this I had the good for|tune, however, to get her relieved from the iron-bolt, which was locked acro&s;s her &s;hins: but a Mrs. <HI>Van Eys,</HI> alledging &s;he had affronted her al&s;o by her <HI>&s;aucy</HI> looks, prevailed on Mrs. Goetzee to renew the puni&s;hment the &s;ame week; when &s;he was actually &s;o cruelly beaten, that I expected &s;he could not have &s;urvived it.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted with this barbarity, I left the e&s;tate Catwyk, determined never more to return to <HI>it:</HI> but I &s;till accom|panying Mr. Goetzee to vi&s;it &s;ome of his other plantations from curio&s;ity, in Cottica and Pirica Rivers, at one of the&s;e, called the <HI>Alia,</HI> a new-born female infant was pre&s;ented me by way of compliment, to give it a name, which I called <HI>Charlotte.</HI> But the next morning, during breakfa&s;t, &s;e|ven negroes were here again tied up and flogged, &s;ome with a <HI>cow-&s;kin,</HI> which is very terrible.&mdash;Hence I made my retreat to the e&s;tate <HI>Sgraven-Hague,</HI> and there, meet|ing a mulatto youth in chains, who&s;e name was <HI>Douglas,</HI> I with horror recollected his unhappy father, who had
<PB N="308" REF="358">
been obliged to leave him a &s;lave, and was now dead. Heartily tired of my excur&s;ion, I was now glad to make ha&s;te back to Paramaribo; where, as &s;oon as I arrived, the fir&s;t news I heard was that Colonel Fourgeoud's French valet-de-chambre, poor <HI>Mon&s;ieur Laurant,</HI> had actually been buried before he was quite dead;&mdash;and that, for hav|ing been found drunk in an ale-hou&s;e, no le&s;s than thir|teen of our men had mo&s;t &s;everely run the gauntlet, and as many been terribly ba&s;tinadoed, the greate&s;t number of which no more &s;aw Europe;&mdash;al&s;o, that a Quaderoon youth and a Dutch &s;ailor were found murdered on the beach.&mdash; I was now proceeding to take a walk on the plain or e&s;pla|nade, but here I was called in by Mr. St&mdash;k&mdash;r, who con|ducting me three &s;tories high: "From this window (&s;aid he) a
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"few days &s;ince, leaped one of my black boys, to e&s;|cape a gentle flogging; however, having only fainted in con&s;equence of his fall, we &s;oon brought him to life again by a hearty &s;couring on the ribs, &s;o he did not e&s;cape; after which, for having ri&s;ked him&s;elf, that is to &s;ay his ma&s;ter's property, and frightened my wife, &s;he ordered him to be &s;ent to Fort Zelandia, where he re|ceived the intere&s;t, that is a mo&s;t confounded <HI>&s;pan&s;o-bocko.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The puni&s;hment called <HI>&s;pan&s;o-bocko</HI> is extremely &s;e|vere indeed, and is executed in the following manner:&mdash; The pri&s;oner's hands being la&s;hed together, he is laid down on the ground on one &s;ide, with his knees thru&s;t between his arms, and the&s;e confined by a &s;trong &s;take,
<PB N="309" REF="359">
which &s;eparates them from his wri&s;ts, and is driven per|pendicularly into the ground, in&s;omuch that he can no more &s;tir than if he was dead. In this locked po&s;ition, tru&s;&s;ed like a fowl, he is beaten on one &s;ide of his breech by a &s;trong negro, with a handful of knotty tamarind branches, till the very fle&s;h is cut away; he is then turned over on the other &s;ide, where the &s;ame dreadful flagellation is inflicted, till not a bit of &s;kin is left, and the place of execution is dyed with blood: after which the raw lacerated wound is immediately wa&s;hed with le|mon-juice and gun-powder to prevent mortification, and then he is &s;ent home to recover as well as he can.</P>
<P>The above cruel and indecent puni&s;hment is &s;ometimes repeated at every &s;treet in the town of Paramaribo, to men and women indi&s;criminately, which is a &s;everity ab&s;o|lutely beyond conception; however, it is never <HI>thus</HI> in|flic;ted without a condemnation from the court. But a &s;ingle <HI>&s;pan&s;o-bocko,</HI> without regard to age or &s;ex, as I have ju&s;t mentioned, may be ordered by any proprietor, either at home, or by &s;ending the victim to the fortre&s;s, with a note to the public executioner, to whom &s;ome trifle in money is paid as a fee of office.</P>
<P>I next was addre&s;&s;ed by a Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rochetaux,</HI> who&s;e Coromantyn cook, having &s;poiled his <HI>ragout,</HI> had ju&s;t cut his own throat to prevent a whipping; and Mr. Charles <HI>Reyn&s;dorp</HI>'s lately did the &s;ame.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVIII.</NOTE>ON the 10th of November, in company with &s;everal other gentlemen, I now once more &s;et out in a tent barge for the encampment at the <HI>Ca&s;&s;eepore</HI> Creek; and this day the whole colony was full of &s;moke, the woods hav|ing taken fire near the &s;ea fide by &s;ome unknown accident. On our pa&s;&s;age we met Colonel <HI>Texier,</HI> who came from the po&s;t <HI>Vredenburgh,</HI> at the Marawina, with a detachment; and a&s;&s;ured us, that &s;ince the blow we gave to the rebels at <HI>Gado-Saby,</HI> they were mo&s;tly fled to the other &s;ide of that great river, where they found refuge among&s;t the French who were &s;ettled in <HI>Cayenne</HI>; he had, however, taken a woman, and lieutenant <HI>Keen</HI> took two men, and killed two more, while the two new black volunteer companies &s;upported the honour of their colours, which they had received with &s;o much ceremony from the governor, by occa&s;ionally bringing in captives from the &s;ea &s;hore be|hind Paramaribo, in which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the In|dians, who had voluntarily fought and defeated the enemy

there, more than once. Thus every thing promi&s;ed fair to crown our endeavours with &s;ucce&s;s, and finally to re-e&s;tabli&s;h &s;afety and tranquillity in the colony.</P>
<P>On our pa&s;&s;age we &s;topped at the e&s;tate <HI>Saardan,</HI> the proprietor of which (by a late marriage) was our Lieu|tenant Colonel <HI>Des Borgnes.</HI> I found here an American &s;ailor who came to load mola&s;&s;es, and having an inclina|tion to try the &s;kill of the new planter (and his over&s;eer) in rum, I de&s;ired the tar to colour a couple of gallons of <HI>kill-devil</HI> made at the very &s;ame plantation, and bring them a&s;hore as rum brought from <HI>Antigua.</HI> He did &s;o, and they gave him in exchange for it a &s;ix gallon keg of the very &s;ame &s;pirits; declaring it was much better than their own, and then drank the contents in punch, to my very great entertainment. The &s;ailor &s;aid he &s;hould colour the &s;ix gallons al&s;o, and did not doubt of loading his boat to the water's edge before he reached Paramaribo. &mdash;Such, in all countries, is the force of prejudice.</P>
<P>Having been very well entertained at Saardan, we &s;et forward, and arrived &s;afe in the encampment at the Ca&s;&s;eepore Creek, in Cottica River, on the 13th; where, in &s;tepping a&s;hore, being without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, I narrowly e&s;caped being bitten by a <HI>land-&s;corpion.</HI> This in&s;ect is of the &s;ize of a &s;mall cray-fi&s;h, and has an oval body; its colour is like that of &s;oot, and it is jointed in moveable rings: it has eight legs, divided by joints, and two jointed claws projecting from the head, appearing like part of the body, with &s;uch &s;mall eyes that they are
<PB N="316" REF="366">
hardly perceptible: the tail is formed by &s;even globular divi&s;ions like beads, which terminate in a double &s;ting; this it bends over its back, to protect its young ones from the attacks of other in&s;ects: for to the creature's back the young re&s;ort, after being hatched from eggs like pin-heads, in a &s;mall web &s;pun by the female. The &s;ting of the land-&s;corpion is not accounted fatal, but occa&s;ions a violent pain, and throws the patient into a fever: it is &s;aid they change their &s;kins, as crabs do their &s;hells. The &s;corpions generally frequent old trees and old furniture, and are often found among&s;t dry rubbi&s;h and faded gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the fir&s;t accidents that I &s;aw here was a poor fellow, a marine, going to bathe in the river, who was in&s;tantly &s;napt away by a large <HI>alligator.</HI> I no &s;ooner beheld him &s;ink and di&s;appear, than having &s;tripped, I actually dived after the poor man, by the help of a long oar, which a negro held perpendicular under water for the purpo&s;e, con&s;tantly taking care to keep all my limbs in motion. However I found him not, and tugging the oar as a &s;ignal to pull it up, the fellow, by mi&s;comprehen|&s;ion, pu&s;hed both it and my&s;elf down with &s;uch violence, that we did not ri&s;e again to the &s;urface till near the middle of the &s;tream, which carried down the oar, while I regained the &s;hore by &s;wimming and very great exertion.</P>
<P>On the 20th, being now once more ordered to march on di&s;covery to <HI>Gado-Saby,</HI> I &s;et out at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, with two &s;ubaltern officers, three &s;erjeants,
<PB N="317" REF="367">
&s;even corporals, and fifty privates, be&s;ides a &s;urgeon, and the noted free negro Gou&s;ary (whom we lo&s;t for three or four hours) and encamped near the banks of the &s;ame creek, not having been able to advance above &s;ix miles due we&s;t from its mouth.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we marched north for about &s;even or eight miles, without meeting with one drop of <HI>water</HI> to alle|viate our burning thir&s;t, it being at this time in the very heart of the dry &s;ea&s;on, which this year was more &s;corch|ing than I ever remembered it before.</P>
<P>Having now changed my cour&s;e to the north-ea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed the quagmire, about noon the following day we marched <HI>dry</HI> through the late fatal mar&s;h, and an hour after we kept due we&s;t; when, falling in with a large field of yams, we demoli&s;hed it; then proceeding for|ward, I encamped in the old &s;ettlement Cofaay, almo&s;t choked for want of water, not having met with any thing like it from the moment we &s;at out. Here, how|ever, the negro &s;laves found means to procure us &s;ome, which, though &s;tagnant and &s;tinking like a kennel, we drank, &s;training it through our &s;hirt-&s;leeves.</P>
<P>During this march, I neverthele&s;s took notice of the following trees, not yet de&s;cribed, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>canavatepy,</HI> and the <HI>berklack,</HI> which are extremely fit for dome&s;tic u&s;e. The fir&s;t is beautifully &s;triped, black and brown, and has much the appearance of that u&s;ually called brazil, while it diffu&s;es a &s;mell in working not inferior to that of a carnation. The &s;econd is a pale red or pink colour, and is
<PB N="318" REF="368">
equally good for almo&s;t every purpo&s;e. I was this day al&s;o pre&s;ented with a &s;ingular kind of fruit, called here the <HI>marmalade box,</HI> being about the &s;ize of a large apple, rather oval, and all covered over with down. This fruit in the beginning is green, and when ripe it turns to a brown colour: the hu&s;k is hard, and by a certain motion opens in halves like a walnut, when the pulp appears like that of a medlar, being a &s;weet brown &s;ub&s;tance, and adhering to large kernels, which the inhabitants &s;uck off with avidity; and from this it derives the above name. As I took no particular notice of the tree, I am &s;orry not to have it in my power to give any account of it what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The 23d I marched ea&s;t from Cofaay, with a view of obtaining &s;ome fre&s;h accounts of the rebels; and pro|ceeded by a path of communication through cultivated fields, but fell in with nothing, &s;ome delightful views, and a large herd of <HI>warree</HI> hogs, excepted, which from the gna&s;hing of their teeth and their &s;tamping the ground before we &s;aw them, we had actually mi&s;taken for a &s;traggling party of the enemy, and had con&s;equently fre&s;h-primed, and prepared to engage them.</P>
<P>About noon we returned to <HI>Gado-Saby,</HI> where, &s;itting down to re&s;t from our fatigue, a tall <HI>old rebel negro</HI> ap|peared &s;uddenly in the very mid&s;t of us, with a long white beard, a white cotton &s;heet tied about his &s;houlders, and a broken cutla&s;s in his hand. Seeing this venerable apparition, I in&s;tantly &s;tarted up, and forbidding my
<PB N="319" REF="369">
people to fire at him, I civilly de&s;ired him to approach me, pledging my&s;elf that no per&s;on under my command &s;hould dare to hurt him; but that he &s;hould have every thing for his relief that I could afford.&mdash;He an&s;wered, "No, no, ma&s;&s;era!" with the utmo&s;t deliberation, and &s;haking his head in an in&s;tant di&s;appeared; while two of my men (contrary to my orders) fired after him, at the di&s;tance of perhaps &s;ix paces only, yet both mi&s;&s;ed their object, to my great &s;atisfaction, he being a poor for|&s;aken creature, that had been left behind the re&s;t, glean|ing a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from his own de&s;erted fields which we had formerly de&s;troyed. What renders the negroes &s;o difficult to hit with a ball is this, that they never run &s;traight forward, but <HI>zig-zag,</HI> like the forked lightning in the elements.</P>
<P>I now, to fulfil my orders, once more ran&s;acked Cofaay, with its adjoining plains, though with a &s;ore heart, on account of the poor lonely old rebel. Here, having cut down &s;everal cotton and plantain-trees, okeor or althea, pigeon-pea&s;e, maize, pine-apples, and &s;ome rice, mo&s;t of which had &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;prung up again &s;ince our la&s;t deva&s;tation, I could not help leaving, before <HI>a little &s;hed,</HI> where was &s;ome fre&s;h a&s;hes and banana &s;hells, a few ru&s;k bi&s;cuits and a good piece of &s;alt beef, as al&s;o a bottle of new rum, for the unfortunate &s;olitary old man, this being his retreat; after which we once more en|camped in the fields of Cofaay.</P>
<P>Having &s;o frequently mentioned <HI>rice,</HI> it may be ex|pected
<PB N="320" REF="370">
that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething concerning its growth and cultivation. It ri&s;es to the height of four feet, with furrowed &s;talks, and in appearance is not unlike wheat, but the &s;talks are knotted by intervals, and &s;tronger; the leaves are like tho&s;e of reeds: the &s;eeds are produced &s;omewhat like barley, and grow on each &s;ide of the &s;pikes or ears alternately. The <HI>oryza</HI> or rice is cultivated in a warm and mar&s;hy &s;oil; the grains are oval, and if good ought to be white, hard, and tran&s;parent. As for the u&s;e of this commodity for food, it is &s;o well known, that I &s;hall only &s;ay, that without this grain our poor marines mu&s;t long ago have all been &s;tarved, particularly in Au|gu&s;t 1775; when, for all allowance, they got <HI>per</HI> day <HI>one</HI> ru&s;k bi&s;cuit, and <HI>three</HI> &s;pikes of maize or Indian corn, for <HI>five men</HI>; rice alone &s;upplying, as I have intimated, the re&s;t of the allowance.</P>
<P>Having now fully compleated my commi&s;&s;ion, I, with my detachment, marched back for the Ca&s;&s;eepore Creek, directing my cour&s;e through the ruined fields of Gado-Saby, which were at pre&s;ent choked up to a perfect wilderne&s;s. Hence we kept fir&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and then due &s;outh, after which we &s;lung our hammocks near a former encampment. It is to be ob&s;erved, that at this time all the mar&s;hes were nearly dry, on account of the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on I ever remember; while the foetid &s;mell occa&s;ioned by the quantities of dead warrapa fi&s;h, that had been de&s;erted by the water, was an intolerable nui|&s;ance. From among&s;t the&s;e putrid fi&s;hes, our negro
<PB N="321" REF="371">
&s;laves neverthele&s;s &s;elected the mo&s;t tolerable, which, fried in the evening, &s;erved them for a delicate mor&s;el.</P>
<P>The morning following we again marched &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, when we &s;lung our hammocks not above four miles from the Ca&s;&s;epore Creek; and on the 26th (keep|ing &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t) we arrived in the <HI>grand camp,</HI> much fatigued and emaciated, my&s;elf with a &s;welled face or ery&s;ipelas; when I gave in my journal to Lieutenant-Colonel de Borgnes, who commanded <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the above route, and all the others to <HI>Gado-Saby,</HI> in Plate LVI. where they are by different lines di&s;tinctly marked.</NOTE>: and I believe, upon my honour, that had we been ordered to remain twenty years on this expedition, with a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving our lives, the different di&s;ea&s;es, plagues, and torments, would &s;till have accumulated and varied without end.</P>
<P>A detachment of fifty men was next &s;ent out to recon|noitre at Jeru&s;alem, &amp;c.; and on the 6th of December the long-expected <HI>relief,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred and fifty men, arrived in the river Surinam from Holland, after a voyage of nine weeks and three days, of which they &s;pent a fortnight at Plymouth.</P>
<P>By the&s;e the unfortunate account was brought, that Captain <HI>Jochem Meyer</HI> (who had on board a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for our troops) was taken by the Moors, and carried with his crew to <HI>Morocco,</HI> where they were condemned to be &s;laves to the emperor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The above captain and his crew were &s;ince &s;et at liberty, having been ran|&s;omed by the Dutch.</NOTE>; and that the
<PB N="322" REF="372">
&s;hip <HI>Paramaribo,</HI> Captain <HI>Spruyt</HI> (being one of the ve&s;&s;els that carried over the &s;ick, in the beginning of Augu&s;t) was wrecked and entirely lo&s;t in the channel, on the rocks of <HI>U&s;hant</HI>; but that, by the exertions of &s;ome French fi&s;hing-boats, the crew and troops had all been &s;aved, and carried into Bre&s;t, whence they had taken a fre&s;h pa&s;&s;age for the Texel; after which the Prince of Orange (who was ever di&s;tingui&s;hed for benevolence, and doing good and hu|mane actions) ordered the officers and private men, above one hundred in number, to receive the following &s;ums, by way of defraying their lo&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> each marine received about four, the &s;ubalterns thirty, the captains forty, and Major <HI>Medlar,</HI> who commanded, fifty pounds &s;terling. However, by this &s;hipwreck, I lo&s;t all my three che&s;ts of &s;weetmeats and pickles, be&s;ides parrots, butterflies, monkies, &amp;c. intended as pre&s;ents to my friends in Eu|rope, which indi&s;criminately went to the bottom, to <HI>my</HI> no &s;mall mortification.</P>
<P>Having now for above a month been lodged in a paltry hut, beaten by the wind and &s;howers of rain (which began to &s;et in unexpectedly); and being informed, that not|with&s;tanding the arrival of the relief, we were &s;till to &s;tay &s;ome time longer in the woods, which broke many hearts; I, on the 12th of December, earne&s;tly &s;et about building for my&s;elf a comfortable hou&s;e, and which was fini&s;hed, without either nail or hammer, in le&s;s than &s;ix days, though it had two rooms, a piazza with rails, and a
<PB N="323" REF="373">
&s;mall kitchen, be&s;ides a garden, in which I &s;owed, in pepper-cre&s;&s;es, the names of Joanna and John; while my next-door neighbour, who was my friend Captain <HI>Bolts,</HI> made &s;hift to keep a goat, and thus we lived not alto|gether uncomfortably. Others kept hens and ducks, but not a <HI>cock</HI> was to be &s;een in the camp; for the&s;e, having fir&s;t had all their tongues cut out to prevent their crow|ing (though to no purpo&s;e) had been &s;ince condemned to lo&s;e their heads. In &s;hort, our gentlemen built a row of very curious hou&s;es indeed, all projecting from the beech; while, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, above a hundred green huts being con&s;tructed to receive the new-come troops, the whole together formed no contemptible &s;treet, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed its inhabitants were little better than &s;care-crows.</P>
<P>What was mo&s;t remarkable in my own habitation, however, was its entry, which was not by the door, nor yet by the window, but only by the roof, where I crept in and out, allowing ab&s;olutely no other admittance; and by this contrivance alone I was effectually guarded from tho&s;e frequent vi&s;itors who &s;melt my pancakes, and u&s;ed to make too free with my eggs and bacon, be&s;ides inter|rupting me while I was drawing, writing, or reading. Upon the whole, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that this encamp|ment was agreeable enough (more &s;o as being on elevated ground), had it not been for the pe&s;tilential damps and mephitic vapours that exhale con&s;tantly from the earth, and had already &s;ent numbers to the other world.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="374">During this &s;hort &s;pace of tranquillity I con&s;tructed in miniature my cottage in which I lived at the Hope, on an oblong board of about eighteen inches by twelve, which being entirely made of the manicole-tree and branches, like the original, was e&s;teemed a ma&s;ter-piece; and this I &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to my friend Mr. de Graaff at Paramaribo, who &s;ince placed it in a cabinet of natural curio&s;ities at Am&s;terdam. As I am upon this &s;ubject, I am tempted to pre&s;ent the reader with a view of two of my habita|tions, the one that at the Hope, where I &s;pent &s;uch happy days; and the other temporary, &s;uch as in the woods we con&s;tructed to be &s;heltered from the weather:&mdash;the fir&s;t may be con&s;idered as the emblem of dome&s;tic felicity; the &s;econd of ru&s;tick hard&s;hip and fatigue.</P>
<P>The troops of the <HI>Society</HI> of Surinam, who had been encamped at the Wana Creek (the rainy &s;ea&s;on prema|turely &s;etting in) now wi&s;ely broke up, and on the 26th pa&s;&s;ing by us, rowed down the river Cottica on their way to the plantations in the Pirica Creek; but as for us, we were as u&s;ual condemned to linger in the Ca&s;&s;ipore camp, while Fourgeoud &s;till kept &s;nug at Paramaribo. With the above officers we received intelligence that a few more rebels had been taken at the Marawina; while we our&s;elves daily continued to &s;end out patroles to the right and left, but met with nothing to capture.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on the 29th, &s;ix barges came to an anchor before our encampment, with part of the fre&s;h troops that were arrived from Holland for our relief; which I could not

help viewing with compa&s;&s;ion, and not without a cau&s;e, many of them being already attacked with the &s;curvy, and other loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es. We however &s;ent for bricks, and built an oven to bake fre&s;h bread, &amp;c. and did all that was in our power to comfort them: having received al&s;o a &s;upply of wine for my own u&s;e, I gave a hearty welcome to all the officers, to cheer their &s;pirits; but this ill-fated liquor had an effect far different from what I in|tended on one of our captains, <HI>P&mdash;t</HI> by name, who, from &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding, challenged me to fight him in&s;tantly. Having retired to &s;ome di&s;tance from the camp, and drawing our &s;abres, he bur&s;t out into an im|moderate fit of laughter, and throwing away his weapon, de&s;ired me
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to cut away; but that for his part he had &s;uch a real regard for me, that he felt it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to make any re&s;i&s;tance:"</Q>
after which, catching me in both his arms, he gave me &s;o hearty an embrace, that he had nearly &s;tifled me, and I could not without the greate&s;t difficulty get di&s;entangled. Being recovered from my &s;urprize, I could not help &s;miling in my turn; and after a friendly reprimand re-conducted my valiant opponent to the company, where we clo&s;ed the year with the greate&s;t mirth and conviviality.</P>
<P>A confounded tumble through my hammock having u&s;hered in the morning of 1777, we went to the com|manding officer of the camp, to pay him the compli|ments of the &s;ea&s;on; where I was &s;hown the <HI>philander,</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="379">
or <HI>Mexican oppo&s;&s;um,</HI> here called <HI>awaree,</HI> which had been ju&s;t taken alive, and with all its young.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the murine oppo&s;&s;um; thus &s;hall now only de&s;cribe &s;uch peculiarities as I was able to remark, and which were indeed but few in number, the animal being in the bottom of an empty hog&s;head when I &s;aw it, its biting preventing me to take it in my hand.&mdash; In the fir&s;t place, it was much larger than the former, this being the &s;ize of an over-grown Norway rat: the colour was a yellowi&s;h grey all over, and the belly and limbs a dirty white; the muzzle was more blunt than that of the murine oppo&s;&s;um, with long whi&s;kers; its eyes not black but tran&s;parent, with a black ring round the iris; the tail extremely long, thick, and hairy, par|ticularly near the root, and its &s;mell was very offen&s;ive. This oppo&s;&s;um had a pouch under its belly, formed by the folding of the &s;kin, which is hairy within as well as without; from this pouch I &s;aw the young ones (five or &s;ix in number) &s;everal times run out, when the mother was not di&s;turbed, and as often run into it upon the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e, or &s;haking the hog&s;head.&mdash;As I pitied the poor creature, after its having been &s;o long tormented, I &s;uddenly kicked up the hog&s;head, when the oppo&s;&s;um with all its young e&s;caped, and ran &s;wiftly up a very high tree before Colonel Seyburg's cottage, and there it hung by the tail to one of the branches; but as it is a dread|ful de&s;troyer of poultry, and the Colonel apprehended that
<PB N="327" REF="380">
it would kill every one of his fowls, he ordered it, to my &s;orrow, to be &s;hot down, with all its young ones.&mdash;The Virginian oppo&s;&s;um I never &s;aw; and my only further remark on this &s;hall be, that its activity very much &s;ur|prized me, as many writers have denied it this quality. For further particulars, I refer the reader to the murine or mou&s;e oppo&s;&s;um above-mentioned, as in mo&s;t circum|&s;tances the&s;e two animals perfectly agree.</P>
<P>Among the de&s;troyers of poultry, there is another ani|mal in this country, known by the name of <HI>quacy-quacy:</HI> &s;ome call it the racoon, but which properly is the <HI>coati|mondi,</HI> or Bra&s;ilian wea&s;el; though many people, with &s;ome degree of propriety, compare it to a fox, as it is often able to carry away a goo&s;e or a turkey, and is al&s;o extremely cunning. This creature is &s;ometimes near two feet long, the body &s;haped like that of a dog, and com|monly black, or rather dark brown, though many are of a bright bay colour: the tail is long, hairy, and annulated with black, and a deep buff; the brea&s;t and belly are a dirty white; the head is a light brown, with long jaws, and a black &s;nout that projects upwards for near two inches, and is moveable like that of the tapira; the eyes are &s;mall, the ears are &s;hort and rounded, while on each &s;ide a curved &s;tripe connects them and the muzzle; the legs of the coati are &s;hort, e&s;pecially the foremo&s;t; the feet are very long, with five toes on each, and long claws, while the animal, like the bear, always walks on the heel, and &s;tands on tho&s;e behind. No quadrupeds (the mon|kies
<PB N="328" REF="381">
not excepted) are better climbers on the trees, where the&s;e creatures commit dreadful ravages among&s;t birds-ne&s;ts, every &s;mall animal which they can conquer be|coming their prey. In the poultry-yards in particular they commit great deva&s;tations, on which account every contrivance that can be invented is put in practice to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>As I am upon the &s;ubject of animals, before I leave the woods I mu&s;t de&s;cribe another creature, which inhabits them, and which (though more than twice the &s;ize of the la&s;t) lives chiefly on ants; this is the <HI>great ant-eater,</HI> or <HI>ant-bear,</HI> called al&s;o the <HI>tamanoir,</HI> and by the Spa|niards the <HI>o&s;a palmera.</HI> The body of this animal is co|vered over with very long &s;haggy hair; on the back and belly it is black, and on the neck and &s;ides a grey or yellowi&s;h white; the head is extremely long and &s;lender, Qf a light bay colour, with very &s;mall eyes; the ears are &s;hort and round, and the mouth (which has no teeth) ju&s;t large enough to admit its tongue; the tail is of an enor|mous &s;ize, with very long black hair, &s;omething like that of a hor&s;e: with this extraordinary tail, when a&s;leep (which is generally in the day time, or during a hard &s;hower of rain) the animal covers it&s;elf like a &s;quirrel; at other times he trails it along, and &s;weeps the ground. The limbs are &s;lender, but covered with long hair; the hindmo&s;t legs being &s;horte&s;t and black, with five claws; tho&s;e before are of a dirty white, with but four claws, the two middle claws being of an extraordinary length.</P>

<P><PB N="329" REF="383">The great ant-eater is a very bad walker, re&s;ting always on the heel of his awkward long feet, like the coati and bear; but he is a better climber, and &s;o good a fighter, that no dog will hunt him, &s;ince whatever animal he catches between his fore claws (nay even the jaguar or tiger) he will not relea&s;e while he has life. His food, as I have &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ts of ants, which he takes in the follow|ing manner:&mdash;when he comes to an ant-hillock, he unfolds his &s;lender tongue, which is about twenty inches long, mo&s;t exactly re&s;embling a worm; this being covered over with a clammy matter or &s;aliva, the ants get upon it in great numbers, and by drawing it into his mouth, he &s;wallows thou&s;ands all alive, and renews the operation, till no more are to be found, when he marches in que&s;t of another mountain, and in the &s;ame manner de&s;troys the unwary inhabitants. He al&s;o climbs in que&s;t of wood|lice and wild honey; but &s;hould he meet with little &s;uc|ce&s;s in his deva&s;tations, he is able to fa&s;t a con&s;iderable time without the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience. It is &s;aid that the great ant-bear is tameable, and that then he will pick crumbs of bread, and &s;mall pieces of fle&s;h; al&s;o that when killed, he affords good food to the Indians and ne|groes, the la&s;t of which I have &s;een devour his fle&s;h with plea&s;ure.

<P>A &s;mall &s;pecies of ant-bear, called the <HI>tamandua,</HI> is al&s;o found in Surinam, though not very common. This
<PB N="330" REF="384">
differs from the former in having twenty toes, the head being thicker in proportion, and the tail &s;maller, which is variegated with bands of black and yellowi&s;h white.&mdash; A le&s;&s;er &s;pecies &s;till is called the <HI>fourmillier,</HI> which, how|ever, never came within my ob&s;ervation.&mdash;But to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>On the 3d, &s;ix more barges with troops came up from Paramaribo, which compleated the number of three hun|dred and fifty men arrived from Holland. Among&s;t the&s;e, being informed there was a Captain <HI>Charles Small,</HI> come from the Scots Brigade, this gentleman having exchanged with poor En&s;ign Macdonald (who was &s;ent over &s;ick) I in&s;tantly &s;culled down the river alone in a canoe to meet him, and offer him my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I had no &s;ooner got on board his barge, than I found him &s;u&s;pended in a hammock with a burning fever. He, not knowing me on account of my dre&s;s, which was no better than that of the mo&s;t ragged &s;ailor, a&s;ked me what I wanted; but when he &s;aw in me his poor friend <HI>Stedman,</HI> changed from a &s;tout &s;prightly young fellow, to a mi&s;erable debi|litated tatterdemallion, he gra&s;ped me by the hand, with|out uttering a word, and bur&s;t into tears: which agitation, while it increa&s;ed his illne&s;s, &s;hewed the goodne&s;s of his heart to me, more than any thing he could have uttered on the &s;ubject.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;n your blubbering, Charles!" &s;aid I;
"turn out of this &s;tinking cockle-&s;hell: I'll pre&s;ently cure thee;"</Q>
&mdash;and getting him hoi&s;ted into my canoe, I brought him on &s;hore to my own habitation, but with
<PB N="331" REF="385">
the greate&s;t difficulty, being obliged to thru&s;t him through a crevice made on purpo&s;e, as the hole in the roof was not calculated even for any healthy per&s;on's admittance, my&s;elf excepted. Having here &s;lung his hammock near to my own, and boiled &s;ome water, I treated him with warm grog and a toa&s;ted bi&s;cuit, and he became much better from that very moment. He now acquainted me that one of his men was drowned on the pa&s;&s;age; and that Colonel Fourgeoud having en|tertained the officers with a ball after their landing, at which one of his cooks, and a couple of meagre marines, had been the fidlers, he concluded his illne&s;s to be the con&s;equence of too much dancing. A little after this, Co|lonel Fourgeoud him&s;elf appearing in per&s;on in the camp among&s;t us, he &s;oon, however, entertained us with mu&s;ick of a different kind; which was no le&s;s than the di&s;courag|ing news, that by the newly-arrived corps of officers &s;e|veral of us had lo&s;t our rank (both in the regiment and in the army) after parching above four years in a burning &s;un, toiling our&s;elves almo&s;t to death, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon &s;tinking meat and black ru&s;k. To add to this grievance, while the above gentlemen u&s;urped our preferment, we were, in&s;tead of being relieved, ordered to continue in the woods, in order to teach them their duty.</P>
<P>During the above unplea&s;ing probation, the major's duty again fell to my &s;hare; which was at this time ex|tremely di&s;agreeable, being obliged daily to cha&s;ti&s;e the men, many of whom pilfered the magazine to alleviate

hunger, having been without the article of bread for <HI>&s;even</HI> days, the oven being dropped to pieces. Among&s;t others, one poor fellow was nearly flogged to death for having <HI>borrowed</HI> one of the colonel's Bologna &s;au&s;ages; for, let it be remembered, that our commander in chief, whatever might be the di&s;tre&s;s and hard&s;hips of the re&s;t, never forgot to &s;upport <HI>his own</HI> dignity, by at lea&s;t half a dozen of &s;tout negroes loaded with bacon hams, Bo|logna &s;au&s;ages, bullocks tongues, tea, coffee, &s;ugar, Ma|deira wine, Holland's gin, &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Courage may prompt, but, ebbing out his &s;trength,</L>
<L>Mere un&s;upported man mu&s;t yield at length:</L>
<L>Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declin'd,</L>

<L>But built anew with health-conferring fare,</L>
<L>With limbs and &s;oul untam'd, <HI>he</HI> tires a war.</L></Q>
<P>At length, on the 8th, a barge arrived, not only with a &s;upply of &s;alt beef and ru&s;k, but a bullock and two hogs, as a pre&s;ent from Mr. <HI>Felman,</HI> who, accompanied by his lady, &amp;c. came actually on a vi&s;it to Fourgeoud, in this very &s;trange encampment. The above animals being immediately killed, they were di&s;tributed among four hundred people; &s;o that it may well be conceived the &s;hares, though &s;weet, were not very large, after which the company walked about to view our different habitations. Being arrived at my dwelling, Fourgeoud led them round and round, but &s;eeing no door to get in, he called out, "Nobody at home?" When
<PB N="333" REF="387">
I in&s;tantly thru&s;t my head through the thatch, with a pan|cake in my hand, and offered to haul in the ladies; but this they civilly declined. I never &s;aw Fourgeoud laugh &s;o much in my life. As &s;oon, however, as he was able to re|cover his gravity, he exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Sacre Dieu! Il faut &ecirc;tre Stedman,&mdash;il faut &ecirc;tre original comme lui</HI>;"</Q>
and re-con|ducted the company to his own apartment, where he gave me an invitation to follow them. Indeed, when Captain Small and I went out, we generally &s;pent our time in a beautiful &s;avannah, where we had erected a green &s;hed, to be free in conver&s;ation, and called it <HI>Ranelagh</HI>; here we carou&s;ed and cracked a bottle in private, till we could crack no longer, having lived &s;o well that in a little time more than a week my chee&s;e and bacon hams quite di&s;appeared, and not a drop of wine or rum was left in the fla&s;ks.&mdash;After this he, as well as I, were obliged to live on &s;hort allowance; while Small had the &s;atisfaction, however, to &s;ee his &s;hip|mates do the &s;ame: who, not being acquainted with the oeconomy nece&s;&s;ary in a fore&s;t, had made all their flour into plum-pudding, and were already obliged to break their teeth on a piece of rye ru&s;k.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;o early as the 12th, one hundred and fifty of the&s;e newly-arrived people were already ordered to march; when, by the way of &s;ea&s;oning them, be&s;ides heavy ac|coutrements and a hammock, they had orders each man to carry a &s;tuffed knap&s;ack on his back. Of this party, my friend Small happened to be one, who being as corpulent as <HI>Sir John Fal&s;taff,</HI> and I having accoutred him in the above
<PB N="334" REF="388">
manner, the poor fellow could hardly walk at all; till declaring to Fourgeoud that I mu&s;t roll him along like a hog&s;head, he got leave to be di&s;engaged from a part of his unweildy encumbrances.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, this loaded detachment now faced to the right, and &s;et out, with Colonel Fourgeoud at their head, for the river Marawina: and while I mu&s;t here acknowledge that this chief was now become to my|&s;elf as civil as I could expect or de&s;ire, yet ju&s;tice compels me to add, that to all others he remained ju&s;t as inflexible a tyrant as ever I had known him; which character he unhappily &s;eemed to think incompatible with his rank.</P>
<P>During their ab&s;ence, I cro&s;&s;ed the water, and cut down a cabbage-tree on the other &s;ide of the river Cottica, not only for the cabbage, but for the &s;ake of the <HI>groe-groe</HI> worms, with which I knew it would &s;warm in about a fortnight.</P>
<P>Straying here through the woods with my black boy Quaco, I met with the following trees, &s;till left for de|&s;cription, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>cedar,</HI> the <HI>brown-heart,</HI> and the <HI>bul|let-tree.</HI> The fir&s;t, though it bears that name, is different from the cedars of Lebanon, which grow in a pyrami|dical form. The Surinam cedar, however, grows al&s;o to a great height, but is principally e&s;teemed becau&s;e the wood is never eaten by the worms or other in&s;ects, on account of its great bitterne&s;s; it has al&s;o a mo&s;t agree|able &s;mell, and is therefore u&s;ed in preference to mo&s;t others for making che&s;ts, cupboards, lockers, and all &s;orts
<PB N="335" REF="389">
of joinery; be&s;ides which, it is employed in making the tent-barges and other boats. The colour of the timber is a pale orange: it is both hard and light, and from the trunk exudes a gum (not unlike the gum Arabic) which is tran&s;parent, and diffu&s;es a mo&s;t agreeable flavour.</P>
<P>The <HI>brown-heart</HI> is in hardne&s;s of the &s;ame con&s;i&s;tency as the purple-heart, and the green-heart already men|tioned, and is &s;haped into heavy timber for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, &s;uch as con&s;tructing &s;ugar-mills, &amp;c.: the co|lour of this wood is a beautiful brown.&mdash;The other is the <HI>bullet-tree</HI>; this tree grows &s;ometimes to &s;ixty feet, but is not &s;o thick in proportion as many others: the bark is grey and &s;mooth, the timber brown, variegated or pow|dered with white &s;pecks. No wood in the fore&s;t is equal to this in weight, being heavier than &s;ea-water, and &s;o very durable, that when expo&s;ed to the open air neither rain or &s;un have any effect on it; for this rea&s;on, be&s;ides its other various u&s;es, it is &s;plit into <HI>&s;hingles</HI> to roof the hou&s;es, in&s;tead of &s;lates or tiles, which, as I formerly men|tioned, would be too heavy and too hot. The&s;e &s;hingles are &s;old for, &pound;. 4 &s;terling a thou&s;and at Paramaribo, and continue &s;ometimes twenty-four years before they are renewed.</P>
<P>I ought to mention al&s;o a kind of mahogany, which is found in the woods of Guiana, called the <HI>ducolla-bolla,</HI> and which is of a &s;uperior quality to any which is im|ported here, being of a deeper red colour, and of a finer, more equal, and compact grain; al&s;o of greater hardne&s;s
<PB N="336" REF="390">
and weight, and thus capable of receiving a more elegant poli&s;h.</P>
<P>About this period the whole camp was infe&s;ted with a kind of <HI>wood-lice,</HI> &s;o called in Surinam, but with more propriety they might be termed white ants, re&s;embling them almo&s;t in every particular, except that the ants dwell in the ground, and the&s;e build their ne&s;ts on the trunks of trees: the&s;e ne&s;ts, being black, round, and ir|regular, are not unlike the woolly head of a negro, but &s;ometimes as large as the half of a hog&s;head, and com|po&s;ed of a ru&s;t-coloured incru&s;tated earth, which is ex|tremely hard, and impenetrable to the weather. In this ma&s;s, which internally con&s;i&s;ts of innumerable cro&s;s roads, each the &s;ize of a goo&s;e-quill, they live together in myriads, whence they &s;ally forth, and commit their depredations, unequalled by any other in&s;ect in Guiana, piercing through the harde&s;t wood, leather, linen, or whatever comes in their way. They al&s;o frequently get into the hou&s;es by an incru&s;ted covered road made again&s;t the wall, re&s;embling the half of a &s;liding pencil, which is with its windings &s;ometimes &s;everal hundred feet long: if this is not de&s;troyed upon its fir&s;t appearance (which mu&s;t be done by ar&s;enick or the oil of turpentine) as they crumble every thing to du&s;t, whole dwellings will be entirely demoli&s;hed, and come down to the ground in rubbi&s;h. The&s;e in&s;ects (notwith&s;tanding their fetid abo|minable &s;mell) are reckoned a very good food for poultry, who are &s;aid to thrive on them even better than on In|dian
<PB N="337" REF="391">
corn. I ought not to forget their extreme indu&s;try in repairing their habitation when injured, and their wonderful power of propagation, which (let ever &s;uch numbers be de&s;troyed) brings them in a very &s;hort time to their former unaccountable multiplicity.</P>
<P>To another pe&s;t we were al&s;o frequently &s;ubjected in this camp, and this was no le&s;s than clouds of <HI>flying lice,</HI> which covered our clothes &s;ometimes &s;o thick, that they ab&s;olutely gave them the appearance of grey cloth. This was owing to the &s;hedding of their wings, which, being four in number; they generally left behind them after they alighted, and being thus without the means of fly|ing off again, they remained on our jackets; except however thus covering us all over, they cau&s;ed us no other inconvenience. It is the opinion of &s;ome natura|li&s;ts, that the&s;e flying lice are no other than the above|mentioned wood-lice, which when they become old get wings, leave their ne&s;ts, and fly about, like &s;ome other ants, both in Europe and in America.</P>
<P>About this time the di&s;cipline was peculiarly &s;trict in the camp, &s;o that whoever made the very lea&s;t noi&s;e was mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed, nay, threatened to be &s;hot; and even the &s;entinels were ordered to challenge rounds and patrols by no other &s;ound than <HI>whi&s;tling,</HI> which was an&s;wered in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>On the 18th, one of the&s;e being condemned to be flogged for &s;peaking loud, I however found means (Four|geoud not being yet returned) to get him pardoned, after
<PB N="338" REF="392">
he was already &s;tripped. The following day, neverthele&s;s, evinced that I could puni&s;h when things were carried too far; for &s;eeing a large piece of boiled pork (about two pounds weight) flying pa&s;t me with great velocity, and finding it was thrown by one marine to another, while they had got a quarrel, I in&s;tantly ordered them to pick it up, and (having cut it in two) I &s;tood over them my|&s;elf till they &s;wallowed every mor&s;el of it in my pre&s;ence, &s;and and all, without either bread or drink: which they &s;ince declared was &s;uch a puni&s;hment as &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my conception, and they &s;hould remember it to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>On the 23d, I received from town a well-timed &s;upply of wine and fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and the &s;ame day Colonel Fourgeoud, with his detachment, arrived from the Mara|wina. During this trip, our active commander had again di&s;covered and de&s;troyed fifty-nine hou&s;es, be&s;ides three fields of provi&s;ions. This certainly gave the fini&s;h|ing blow to the rebel negroes, &s;ince, having no further &s;upply on this &s;ide the water, they entirely abandoned it, and went to &s;ettle in the French colony <HI>Cayenne.</HI> In this hard though nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice the men had &s;uffered pro|digiou&s;ly, e&s;pecially tho&s;e newly arrived; numbers of whom were carried in hammocks on poles, while near thirty were left &s;ick at the Marawina, and my friend Small was at lea&s;t one &s;tone lighter.</P>
<P>At this time, in the camp ho&s;pital, above one hundred were al&s;o dangerou&s;ly ill. Nothing was heard but &s;ighs
<PB N="339" REF="393">
and the &s;hrieking of the <HI>&s;trix</HI> or Guiana owl, which for ever kept them company during the di&s;mal nights. Cramps, &s;o common in Surinam, al&s;o infe&s;ted tho&s;e that were able to do duty; and there reigned a general melan|choly all around.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;The circling &s;ky,</L>
<L>The wide enlivening air, is full of fate;</L>
<L>And, &s;truck by turns, in &s;olitary pangs</L>
<L>They fall, untended and unmourn'd.</L></Q>
<P>Here one man was to be &s;een covered over with bloody boils from head to foot; there another led along by two of his comrades in a deep lethargy, who, in &s;pite of pinch|ing and pricking, do&s;ed into eternity; a third, &s;welled by the drop&s;y, and imploring the &s;urgeon in vain to tap off the water (who generally an&s;wered that it was too late) was left to expire by &s;uffocation. In the ho&s;pital &s;ome were ob&s;erved cla&s;ping their hands, and praying aloud to God to be relieved; while others lay at their &s;ide in a frenzy fever, tearing their hair, bla&s;pheming Providence, and cur&s;ing the day that they were born.&mdash;In &s;hort, all was dreadful beyond de&s;cription, by the pen of a <HI>Milton</HI> excepted.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Sad noi&s;ome dark,</L>

<L>And over them triumphant Death his dart</L>

<L>With vows, as their chief good and final hope.</L></Q>
<P>From day to day mortality now gained ground, while by &s;ome accident, to compleat the di&s;tre&s;s, part of the camp got on fire; but this was fortunately extingui&s;hed without any material ill con&s;equences, by the activity and exertions of the poor negroes.</P>
<P>On the 26th <HI>my</HI> mi&s;ery, however, drew towards an end, when, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, and without my a&s;king it, Colonel Fourgeoud gave me a leave of ab&s;ence, if I cho&s;e it, to accompany him, and &s;tay henceforth at Paramaribo; which, without he&s;itation, I mo&s;t joyfully accepted. Thus, having made my friend Captain Small a pre&s;ent of my <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> my <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and all my <HI>fre&s;h provi&s;ions,</HI> be&s;ides entertained him and &s;ome other officers on a di&s;h of mountain-cabbage, and my <HI>groe-groe</HI> worms, which were ju&s;t come to perfection, be&s;ides a hearty gla&s;s of wine, I took my la&s;t adieu from them all; and at midnight, with Colonel Fourgeoud, rowed down the River Cottica in an elegant barge with ten oars, in company with two more of his officers.&mdash;And now farewell once more, ye &s;hady

woods, thou plea&s;ing gloomy fore&s;t, pregnant with &s;o many wonders, and &s;o many plagues, and which, in the opinion of &s;o many &s;ufferers, even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the <HI>ten plagues of Egypt!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should it be remarked that during this expedition &s;ome unchri&s;tian-like ex|pre&s;&s;ions have e&s;caped, let it be at the &s;ame time recollected, that while &s;ur|geons and even cooks, though both of lit|tle u&s;e, had been provided, nothing like a <HI>par&s;on</HI> was ever &s;een among&s;t us, from the day we &s;ailed from the Texel.</NOTE></P>

<P>The boat being &s;hoved off, Colonel Fourgeoud now declared to us, that having ran&s;acked the fore&s;t in every direction, and driven the rebels over the Marawina in <HI>Cayenne,</HI> he was determined no more to return to the woods, but in a few weeks to draw the long and painful expedition to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now, reader, it remains with you to acknowledge that I have not led you <HI>about the bu&s;h,</HI> but <HI>through it,</HI> with in|defatigable per&s;everance: the more &s;o, when it is to be con&s;idered that in the middle of the above hurry and di&s;tre&s;s, under which &s;o many have &s;unk, I have often been deprived of <HI>pen, ink,</HI> and <HI>paper</HI> to make proper an|notations; which la&s;t defect I have even more than once &s;upplied by writing with a pencil on my cartridges, or on a bleached <HI>bone:</HI> had this not been unavoidably the ca&s;e, more accuracy and many more remarks might with

ju&s;tice have been expected, which one need never be at a lo&s;s to make in a country &s;o replete with different ob|jects for &s;peculation.</P>
<P>Having rowed all night, and breakfa&s;ted at the new cordon (which was begun to be cut not far from our former po&s;t Devil's Harwar) on a dram and a bi&s;cuit, we came about noon to the e&s;tate <HI>Lapaix,</HI> where we dined with the planter, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rivieres</HI>; after which Fourgeoud, with his adjutant, proceeded on their voyage to town, while I with another officer went to the &s;ea-&s;ide at the back of the plantation to &s;hoot &s;nipes and curlews.</P>
<P>On our march thither and back again, pa&s;&s;ing two po&s;ts of the Society, the flag was hoi&s;ted, refre&s;hments offered us, and every other civility &s;hewn us that was in the power of the commanding officers. In &s;hooting, however, we had very little &s;port, except that of killing &s;ome <HI>&s;nipes,</HI> which flew in &s;uch clouds that they almo&s;t darkened the &s;ky; &s;o that by only firing from time to time above our heads at random, we brought down &s;cores at every &s;hot, but they were of &s;uch a diminutive &s;pe|cies, that they were &s;carcely worth the picking up. We might have here killed birds of greater &s;ize, &s;uch as <HI>&s;poon-bills, cranes, red curlews,</HI> and <HI>wild ducks</HI> of many kinds, had we not unluckily been cut off from the banks on which they were &s;cattered, by the &s;ea over|flowing the quick&s;ands betwixt us and them. They afforded us, neverthele&s;s, a mo&s;t delightful view, the beech appearing at a di&s;tance like a &s;heet of &s;carlet and purple, embroidered with every other colour.</P>

<P><PB N="343" REF="398">The <HI>&s;hoveler</HI> or &s;poon-bill (which has &s;ome affinity to the cranes) is about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e: the legs are not very long, and it is web-footed but for a little way be|tween the toes: the feathers are a beautiful ro&s;e-colour, though they are white when young; but the bill is truly remarkable in this bird, being flat, much broader before than at any other part, and circular, in &s;ome degree re|&s;embling a &s;poon, from which it takes its name. They are &s;aid to feed on frogs, rats, and lizards, yet fi&s;h is evi|dently their principal nouri&s;hment, from their frequent|ing the &s;ea-&s;ide, and having a fi&s;hy ta&s;te when they are killed.</P>
<P>The <HI>crane</HI> or <HI>jabiru</HI> of Surinam, I can be&s;t compare to a &s;tork, of which it has much the appearance, but is larger. The body of this bird is milk white, but the prime feathers of the wings and tail are black: the limbs and toes are exce&s;&s;ively long; but I ob&s;erved one pecu|liarity which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all other birds, <HI>viz.</HI> that it frequently &s;its upon the heel: the neck and bill are of an uncommon length, the latter being &s;trong, and a little hooked at the point. The head of the crane or jabiru is perfectly black, on account of which, among the Dutch, it obtained the appellation of a <HI>negro-cop.</HI> It fre|quents the coa&s;t, like the others above mentioned, and lives entirely on fi&s;h: this bird is ea&s;ily tamed. I have &s;een a couple of them in the poultry-yard belonging to Colonel Fourgeoud.&mdash;(See both the&s;e &s;pecies of &s;ea-fowls in the <HI>plate annexed,</HI> where the la&s;t is repre&s;ented &s;itting in the po&s;ture I have de&s;cribed.)</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="399">To delineate the different &s;pecies of wild ducks that are in Surinam with any degree of accuracy, is a ta&s;k which I acknowledge to be far beyond my reach.

<P>Having the following day the opportunity of a boat, I pro&s;ecuted my voyage down the Cottica River till I came to Paramaribo, where in fine &s;pirits and perfect health (however &s;trange) I arrived that very &s;ame evening, and where I was mo&s;t heartily welcomed by my many friends with the warme&s;t congratulations on my &s;till exi&s;ting, after having e&s;caped &s;o many dangers, and been &s;o long deprived of every comfort&mdash;torn by thorns, &s;tung by in|&s;ects&mdash;&s;tarved, tormented, emaciated, and wounded&mdash;often without clothes, health, re&s;t, money, refre&s;hments, medi|cines, or friends;&mdash;and after having lo&s;t &s;o many of my brave companions, who lay buried in the du&s;t.&mdash;Thus ended my &s;eventh and <HI>la&s;t</HI> campaign in the fore&s;t of Guiana.</P>

<P>BEING now once more arrived in town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIX.</NOTE> and wi&s;hing to be no longer trouble&s;ome to any body, I hired a very neat &s;mall hou&s;e by the water-&s;ide, in which we lived nearly as happy as we had done at the Hope.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on that vi&s;ited me here was the American Captain <HI>Lewis,</HI> of the <HI>Peggy,</HI> who, to my great concern, told me, that poor <HI>Macdonald,</HI> the grateful &s;ailor, had died on the homeward pa&s;&s;age, after being twelve days at &s;ea; and de&s;ired him in his la&s;t words to return me, with his good wi&s;hes, the mother-of-pearl cork-&s;crew I had formerly given him. He farther acquainted me al&s;o, to my &s;orrow, that three Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els had been captured by the <HI>American Revenue</HI> privateer &s;loop, which lay at this time, with her prizes, in the road before Paramaribo; one of which, belonging to Ireland, was valued at above &pound;. 50,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>Having been waited on by a number of planters and
<PB N="346" REF="401">
others with congratulations on our &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the re|bels; among&s;t the re&s;t appeared the celebrated <HI>Gramman Quacy,</HI> who came to &s;hew me his fine coat, gold medal, &amp;c. which he had received as a pre&s;ent from the Prince of Orange, in Holland. This man, being one of the mo&s;t extraordinary characters of all the negroes in Surinam, or perhaps in the world, I cannot proceed without giving &s;ome account of him; the more &s;o, as he has made his appearance once or twice already in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory.&mdash;This African (for he was born on the coa&s;t of Guinea) by his in&s;inuating temper and indu&s;try, not only obtained his freedom from a &s;tate of &s;lavery, but by his wonderful ingenuity and artful conduct found the means of procuring a very competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Having got the name of a <HI>lockoman,</HI> or &s;orcerer, among the lower &s;laves, no crime of any con&s;equence was com|mitted, e&s;pecially at the plantations, but <HI>Gramman Quacy,</HI> which &s;ignifies Great-man Quacy, was in&s;tantly &s;ent for to di&s;cover the perpetrators, which he &s;o very &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed, owing, in fact, to their faith in his &s;orceries, added to his penetrating look <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See in Chapter XXV. the manner in which I my&s;elf di&s;covered a thief.</NOTE> and authority among them, that he has often prevented farther mi&s;chief to their ma&s;ters; and, for the&s;e &s;ervices, occa&s;ionally received very capital rewards. The corps of rangers, and all fighting free negroes, are under his influence; to whom he &s;ells his <HI>obias</HI> or <HI>amulets,</HI> in order to make them in|vulnerable,
<PB N="347" REF="402">
and, of cour&s;e, to engage without fear: by which deceit he has mo&s;t certainly done much good to the colony, and at the &s;ame time filled his pockets with no incon&s;iderable profit to him&s;elf; while his per&s;on by the blacks is adored and re&s;pected like a God. The tra&s;h of which his amulets are made co&s;ts him in reality no|thing; being neither more nor le&s;s than a collection of &s;mall pebbles, &s;ea-&s;hells, cut hair, fi&s;h-bones, feathers, &amp;c. the whole &s;ewed up together in &s;mall packets, which are tied with a &s;tring of cotton round the neck, or &s;ome other part of the bodies of his credulous votaries.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e, and many other artful contrivances, he had the good fortune, in 1730, to find out the valuable root known by the name of <HI>Quaciae bitter,</HI> of which he was actually the fir&s;t di&s;coverer, and from which it took its name: and, notwith&s;tanding this medicine is now le&s;s in repute in England than formerly, it is highly e&s;teemed in many other parts of the world for its efficacy in &s;trengthening the &s;tomach and re&s;toring the appetite. It has, be&s;ides this valuable property, that of being a powerful <HI>febrifuge,</HI> and may be &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed when the bark is nau&s;eated, as is frequently the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1761, it was made known to <HI>Linnaeus</HI> by Mr. <HI>d'Ahlberg,</HI> formerly mentioned; and the Swedi&s;h natura|li&s;t has &s;ince written a treati&s;e upon it. By this drug alone Quacy might have ama&s;&s;ed riches, were he not entirely abandoned to indolence and di&s;&s;ipation; the con|&s;equence of which is, a complication of loath&s;ome di&s;|tempers,
<PB N="348" REF="403">
of which the lepro&s;y is one: and that di&s;order is, as I have already &s;tated, ab&s;olutely incurable. Never|thele&s;s his age, though he could not exactly a&s;certain it, mu&s;t have been very great, &s;ince he u&s;ed frequently to repeat that he acted as drummer, and beat the alarm on his ma&s;ter's e&s;tate, when the French commodore, <HI>Jacques Ca&s;&s;ard,</HI> put the colony under contribution, in the year 1712.</P>
<P>Having taken a portrait of this extraordinary man, with his grey head of hair, and dre&s;&s;ed in his blue and &s;carlet with gold lace, I, in the annexed plate, beg leave to introduce it to the reader.</P>
<P>This very &s;ame week we had indeed a fre&s;h proof of the good effects of Gramman Quacy's animating obias or amulets, a captain of the rangers, named <HI>Hannibal,</HI> bringing in the barbacued hands of two rebel negroes, which he had him&s;elf encountered and &s;hot; and one of the&s;e hands proved to be that of the noted rebel <HI>Cupido,</HI> formerly taken, in 1774, and brought to Colonel Four|geoud in the fore&s;t, but from whom he had &s;ince that time, though loaded with chains, found means to run away.</P>
<P>In returning the vi&s;its of my friends, I paid one to Mr. <HI>Andrew Reyn&s;dorp,</HI> who &s;hewed me the loop and button of his hat, which being diamond, had co&s;t him two hun|dred guineas&mdash;&s;uch is the luxury of Surinam. But even this is exceeded by the magnificence of M. <HI>d'Ahlbergh,</HI> who, when I waited on him, be&s;ides a gold &s;nuff-box &s;et

with brilliants, value &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling, made me remark two &s;ilver bits (&s;mall pieces of money) &s;et in gold, and &s;urrounded with diamonds, with this in&s;crip|tion:
<Q>"Soli Deo Gloria. Fortuna beaticum, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;ignified my &s;urprize at this peculiar attention and re&s;pect to two &s;ixpences, he declared to me that they were all the money he had in the world when he fir&s;t came to Surinam from his own country, <HI>Sweden.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did you work?"</Q>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No: but, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I whined and acted the enthu&s;ia&s;t, which &s;ometimes is very nece&s;&s;ary, and I found preferable to the other <HI>three.</HI>"</Q>
&mdash;To which I an&s;wered,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, your candid con|fe&s;&s;ion brings back to my remembrance your u&s;age of your negro &s;lave, <HI>Baron,</HI> after having promi&s;ed him his manumi&s;&s;ion in Am&s;terdam, and fully proves what you have ju&s;t a&s;&s;erted."</Q>
&mdash;One in&s;tance more of the ex|travagance and folly of the inhabitants of this colony, and I have done: Two of them di&s;puting about a mo&s;t elegant and expen&s;ive carriage that was imported from Holland, a law-&s;uit en&s;ued immediately, to determine who was to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, during which time the coach was left uncovered in the &s;treet till it fell to pieces, and was totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>On the 10th of February, mo&s;t of our officers being now arrived at Paramaribo from the camp, Colonel
<PB N="350" REF="406">
Fourgeoud entertained the whole with a fea&s;t, as he was plea&s;ed to call it, at the head-quarters; an old &s;table lan|thorn, with broken panes of gla&s;s, hanging over our heads, which I expected every moment to drop into the &s;oup. And here he acquainted us, with evident marks of &s;atis|faction, that he had at la&s;t put a final end to the expe|dition; having, notwith&s;tanding there was &s;o little blood|&s;hed, perfectly accompli&s;hed his aim in rooting out the rebels, by de&s;troying TWENTY-ONE TOWNS or VILLAGES, and demoli&s;hing TWO HUNDRED FIELDS with vegetables of every kind, on which they depended for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: al&s;o, that the intelligence was now confirmed, that the negroes were to a man fled over the River Marawina, where they and their friends were &s;ettled, and protected by the French colony of Cayenne, who not only gave them &s;helter, but &s;upplied them with every thing they wanted. On which good news we all heartily congratu|lated him, and drank further pro&s;perity to the colony of Surinam with three cheers; the future &s;afety of which now depended on the new cordon or path of circumval|iation, defended by the troops of the Society, and the corps of black &s;oldiers or rangers.</P>
<P>In Dr. <HI>Firmyn</HI>'s works, Colonel Fourgeoud and his troops are twice mentioned as the &s;aviours of the co|lony; and by the Abb&egrave; <HI>Reynal</HI> they are noticed as a very brave and valiant corps: compliments to which they are with truth entitled. And what cannot but redound to his honour, is, that at the time he impo&s;ed &s;uch hard|&s;hips
<PB N="351" REF="407">
on his own troops, he never deliberately put a rebel negro captive to death, nor even, if he could avoid it, delivered them into the hands of ju&s;tice; well knowing, that while it was his duty to expel them, nothing but the mo&s;t barbarous u&s;age and tyranny had driven the&s;e poor people to this la&s;t extremity. Indeed I my&s;elf, whom during the fir&s;t three years he per&s;e|cuted with unremitting &s;everity, mu&s;t do him the ju&s;|tice to &s;ay, that he was indefatigable in doing his duty; and that, though confu&s;ed, I believe him at bottom to have been an undaunted and very BRAVE OFFICER.</P>
<P>He further acquainted us, that the ve&s;&s;els, with a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions from Holland, had been ca&s;t on the lee-&s;hore in the Texel Roads, one of them having her upper cabin &s;tove away, with the &s;econd mate and three of her men wa&s;hed overboard; he added, however, that part of the &s;tores had been &s;aved, and loaded on hoard two bilanders, which were this very day arrived in the River Surinam. And now, &s;o much in particular was I become his favourite, that he even made me his confi|dant; and declared, that he propo&s;ed keeping the la&s;t ar|rived troops, however fa&s;t they were dying away (and who had lately lo&s;t a man by &s;traying in the woods) en|camped for many months after our departure. He then began to tell me what officers he meant, if po&s;&s;ible, to ruin on their return, and which, by his recommendation, he intended to promote: but here I took the liberty to &s;top him &s;hort, by declaring, upon my honour, that tho&s;e very gentlemen &s;hould be appri&s;ed by my&s;elf of their im|pending
<PB N="352" REF="408">
danger, if he per&s;i&s;ted in carrying this cruel plan in execution. This at lea&s;t had the effect to end the di&s;|agreeable conver&s;ation: when, in my turn, I added,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, permit me farther to put you in remembrance of the&s;e very troops you have ju&s;t mentioned, in regard to their truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation at the <HI>Ca&s;&s;eepore Creek</HI>; while their &s;urgeon is gaining gold watches and dia|mond rings by curing fa&s;hionable di&s;ea&s;es among the gentry at Paramaribo."</Q>
To which he replied,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Vous &ecirc;etes un brave gar&ccedil;on</HI>;"</Q>
and promi&s;ed to take my hints into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I was now invited once more by Captain Mackneal to &s;pend a few days on his coffee e&s;tate, Spork&s;gift; but though I was prevented on this occa&s;ion from accepting the invitation, I will take this opportunity to de&s;cribe that u&s;eful berry, which, not being a native of Guiana, it is &s;aid was fir&s;t planted in Surinam by the Count <HI>de Neale,</HI> though others a&s;cribe it to one <HI>Han&s;bach,</HI> a &s;ilver-&s;mith, in 1720 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1554, the coffee berry fir&s;t came to Con&s;tantinople from Arabia.&mdash;About the middle of the 16th century it was in|troduced in London; and in 1728, by Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws,</HI> it was planted in the i&s;land of Jamaica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The coffee-berry is the produce of an elegant tree, which is &s;eldom allowed to grow higher than a man can reach, in order to facilitate the gathering of it. The bark of this tree is light brown, and the leaves like laurel, having a beautiful poli&s;h; with the&s;e it is thickly co|vered,
<PB REF="409">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Sprig of the Coffee Tree.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="353" REF="410">
the branches diverging from near the &s;urface of the earth to the &s;ummit. The berries, which are oval, are fir&s;t green, and gradually change their colour, till they are ripe, when they acquire a bright crim&s;on hue, like that of a cherry. In each of the&s;e berries are two kernels re&s;embling beans, lying flat upon each other. Of the&s;e a good tree is &s;aid to produce three or four pounds weight at each crop; for this tree, like mo&s;t other vegetable pro|ductions in this luxuriant climate, bears two crops every year.</P>
<P>To give the curious a better idea of this u&s;eful plant, I pre&s;ent him with a &s;prig of it, copied from nature in the <HI>annexed plate</HI>;&mdash;in which the figure <HI>A</HI> refers to the wood, where it was cut off; <HI>B</HI> is the upper &s;ide of the leaf; <HI>C</HI> the lower &s;ide of the &s;ame; <HI>D</HI> is the berry ju&s;t beginning to change; <HI>E</HI> the &s;ame in full perfection, being of a beau|tiful crim&s;on; and <HI>F</HI> the kernels or beans as they appear when they are dive&s;ted of their hu&s;k, and ready for ex|portation.</P>
<P>The buildings on a coffee e&s;tate are, fir&s;t, the dwelling hou&s;e, which is u&s;ually &s;ituated for plea&s;ure near the banks of a river; and for convenience adjoining to it are erected the outhou&s;es for the over&s;eer and book|keeper, with &s;tore-hou&s;es and &s;mall offices: the other nece&s;&s;ary buildings are a carpenter's lodge, a dock and boat-hou&s;e, and two capital coffee-lodges, the one to brui&s;e and &s;eparate the pulp from the berries, the other to dry them; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;t of negro-hou&s;es, a &s;table, ho&s;pital,
<PB N="354" REF="411">
and warehou&s;es, which altogether appear like a &s;mall vil|lage. The coffee-lodge alone &s;ometimes co&s;ts five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and &s;ometimes more. But to give a more complete idea of the whole apparatus, I mu&s;t refer to the <HI>plate,</HI> where all the buildings, fields, paths, gardens, floodgates, and canals are marked, and explained by the nece&s;&s;ary references. The plan, as exhibited in this plate, is intended to unite at once elegance, convenience, and &s;afety. It is elegant, as being perfectly regular; conve|nient, as having every thing at hand and under the planter's own in&s;pection; and &s;afe, being &s;urrounded by a broad canal, which by floodgates lets in the water fre&s;h from the river, be&s;ides a draw-bridge, which during the night cuts off all communication from without.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the planting-ground, which is divided into large &s;quare pieces, in each of which are ge|nerally two thou&s;and beautiful coffee-trees, growing at eight or ten feet di&s;tance from each other. The&s;e trees, which begin to bear at about the age of three years, are in their prime at &s;ix, and continue to produce fruit till they are thirty; the manner of &s;upplying them being from good nur&s;eries, which no coffee e&s;tate is ever with|out, having already mentioned that they afford two crops every year, which is about Mid&s;ummer and Chri&s;t|mas.</P>
<P>At the times of harve&s;t, it is not unplea&s;ing to &s;ee the negroes picking the crim&s;on berries among the poli&s;hed green, where allages and &s;exes are employed to fulfil their
<PB REF="412">

<PB N="355" REF="413">
ta&s;k with ardour, when the youth who having fir&s;t filled their ba&s;kets, wantonly run naked, and play among&s;t the luxuriant foliage.</P>
<P>I will now conduct them before the over&s;eer's pre&s;ence, where, all the ba&s;kets being in&s;pected, the flogging com|mences, which is mo&s;tly inflicted with impartial &s;everity on all who have not fulfilled their ta&s;ks, whether from idlene&s;s or incapacity. This ceremony concluded, the berries are carried home into the brui&s;ing-lodge, and the &s;laves re|turn home to their hou&s;es. The berries being brui&s;ed in a mill for that purpo&s;e, in the above lodge, to &s;eparate the kernels from the hu&s;ks or pulpy &s;ub&s;tance, they are next &s;teeped in water one night to clean&s;e them, and then &s;pread on the drying-floor, which is expo&s;ed to the open air, and is con&s;tructed of flat &s;tones; after which they are &s;pread on garrets made for the purpo&s;e, to let them evaporate and dry internally, during which time they mu&s;t be turned over every day with wooden &s;hovels: this done, they are once more dried in large coolers or drawers, that run ea&s;ily on rollers in and out of the win|dows, to prevent them from being overtaken by &s;howers of rain: then they are put into wooden mortars, and beaten by candle-light with heavy wooden pe&s;tles, like the rice at Gado-Saby, to dive&s;t them of a thin coat or pellicle that unites the two kernels in the pulp. At this exerci&s;e the negroes wonderfully keep time, and always &s;ing a chorus. Being next &s;eparated from the chaff through a bunt-mill once more thoroughly dried on the
<PB N="356" REF="414">
coolers, and the whole beans picked from the brui&s;ed, which la&s;t are con&s;umed in the colony: they are finally put into ca&s;ks or barrels, of about three or four hundred weight each, for exportation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only farther ob&s;erve, that in Surinam &s;ome coffee plantations produce above 150,000 pounds weight <HI>per annum</HI>; and that, as I have already mentioned, in the year before our arrival no le&s;s was exported to Am&s;terdam alone than 12,267,134 pounds of this valuable article, the prices of which have fluctuated, from three-pence half|penny to eighteen pence; but which, calculated at the average price of eight-pence halfpenny, produces a yearly income of not le&s;s than 400,000 pounds &s;terling; (which is no de&s;picable revenue) be&s;ides what goes to Rotterdam and Zealand.</P>
<P>This is &s;ufficient to prove that the cultivation of coffee is highly worthy the attention of the planters: and as for the virtues of this excellent berry, without entering into particulars, I will only refer the reader to that highly-approved pamphlet, entitled
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Treati&s;e concerning the Properties and Effects of Coffee; by <HI>Benjamin Mo&s;ely,</HI> M. D. Author of Ob&s;ervations on the Dy&s;entery of the We&s;t Indies;"</Q>
from which I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of extracting the following pa&s;&s;age:&mdash;

<P>With the above de&s;cription I mu&s;t conclude the ob&s;er|vations which I have been able to make on &s;uch of the vegetable productions of this colony, as have offered them&s;elves to my examination. But &s;o abundant is the variety, and &s;o extraordinary the properties, of the trees, plants, roots, &amp;c. of this country, that by far the greater number are as yet perfectly unknown to the olde&s;t inha|bitants of this &s;ettlement, and to all the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>A few years ago a Count <HI>Gentelly,</HI> an ingenious noble|man, travelled through the de&s;arts of Guiana with &s;ome Indians, and had acquired con&s;iderable knowledge in this his favourite &s;tudy. But alas! his labours, which pro|mi&s;ed fair to be of material benefit to the Botanic So|ciety, and to mankind in general, were interrupted by a fever, which, owing to his exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, he caught at the River Correntine, and cut him off in the mid&s;t of his u&s;eful and entertaining re&s;earches.</P>
<P>Having now concluded my account of the different productions of the colony, particularly cotton, &s;ugar, ca|cao, indigo, and coffee, to which it is indebted for its riches; and having once more repeated that the different trees, &s;hrubs, plants, roots, gums, and perfumes, are equally as innumerable as they are excellent; I cannot have a fairer opportunity of fulfilling my promi&s;e of
<PB N="358" REF="416">
&s;ubmitting to the reader a few con&s;iderations, by an at|tention to which I cannot help thinking that not only Surinam, but the We&s;t India colonies in general, might accumulate wealth to them&s;elves, and promote the per|manent happine&s;s of the &s;laves that are under their &s;ub|jection, without having recour&s;e to the <HI>Coa&s;t of Guinea</HI> to &s;upply the almo&s;t hourly con&s;umption of that unfortu|nate people. But before I proceed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the manner in which the negro &s;laves <HI>are</HI> di&s;tri|buted and treated, by the cu&s;toms of this &s;ettlement only, without adverting to the di&s;tribution or govern|ment of them in other colonies; from which, however, tho&s;e may equally derive &s;ome profit;&mdash;and then I &s;hall endeavour to point out how, in my opinion, they <HI>ought</HI> to be di&s;tributed and treated, according to the laws, not only of humanity but of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved that in Surinam there are &s;up|po&s;ed to be on an average about 75,000 negro &s;laves of all denominations, which (allowing them, for the &s;ake of a round number, to amount to 80,000) are here di&s;tri|buted in the following extraordinary manner, <HI>viz.</HI> The plantations, being about 800 in number, though &s;ome have but 24 negroes, and others 400, we will &s;uppo&s;e them to po&s;&s;e&s;s 100 &s;laves each, which complement is exactly the above number of 80,000 people.

<P><PB N="360" REF="418">By this it appears, that no more than 20,000, or only one-fourth of the whole number, are condemned to do all the labour of the fields, on whom it may be &s;aid chiefly falls the dreadful lot of untimely mortality that I have formerly mentioned. Now it is evident, that if the 50,000 able-bodied &s;laves that are in the colony of Surinam were put to equal drudgery, the mortality, which is now at the rate of five <HI>per cent.</HI> would then increa&s;e to at lea&s;t the number of twelve out of every hundred, and would compleatly extirpate the whole ma&s;s in little more than eight years time.</P>
<P>Having thus at an average demon&s;trated how they are di&s;tributed, I mu&s;t briefly ob&s;erve, that while full 30,000 live better than the common people of England, and near 30,000 are kept in idlene&s;s, and do no work in the fields; the remaining 20,000 may be cla&s;&s;ed (that is in general) among the mo&s;t mi&s;erable wretches on earth; and are worked, &s;tarved, in&s;ulted, and flogged to death, without being &s;o much as allowed to complain for redre&s;s, with|out being heard in their own defence, without receiving common ju&s;tice on any occa&s;ion, and thus may be con|&s;idered as dead-alive, &s;ince cut off from all the common privileges of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I will now proceed, by candidly a&s;king the world, If the above is not an improper and &s;en&s;ele&s;s mi&s;application, not only of wealth, but of human life and labour; which, only by a proper di&s;tribution and management, might accumulate the one and relieve the other?</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="419">Now would this incon&s;iderate colony but give up their habits of pride and luxury, nay, in a moderate degree, 20,000 negroes at lea&s;t might be added to tho&s;e now la|bouring in the fields, which (providing the whole were treated with le&s;s &s;everity) mu&s;t at the &s;ame time keep the above &s;uperfluous number of idlers employed; and by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the others in their nece&s;&s;ary occupations, could not but tend greatly to prevent that &s;hocking mor|tality, to which they are at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed by unbound|ed ill-u&s;age and barbarity.</P>
<P>But every reform mu&s;t begin at that which is the &s;ource of <HI>manners</HI> as well as of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI>; and tho&s;e therefore who are entru&s;ted with the executive government &s;hould have no temptation to overlook the breaches of a <HI>law,</HI> while it ought to be a &s;acred and invariable rule never to allow either the governor or the magi&s;trates of &s;uch a colony to be the proprietors of more &s;laves than merely a limited number, to attend on their per&s;ons, according to their ranks: &s;ince more than once, even to <HI>my</HI> ob&s;ervation, it has occurred that tho&s;e who made, and tho&s;e who were appointed to enforce the laws, have been the fir&s;t that <HI>broke them,</HI> for the paltry benefit of cau&s;ing their ne|groes to work on a Sunday, or to follow the bent of their unbounded pa&s;&s;ions; from which &s;hameful example from the magi&s;trate, the contagion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;pread among the individuals.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>governor</HI> and principal <HI>magi&s;trates,</HI> there|fore, be &s;ent out from Europe; let them be gentle|men of fortune and education; and, above all, men
<PB N="362" REF="420">
of liberal minds, men that are firm and proof again&s;t the allurement of a bribe, or the glittering of gold, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are re&s;trained by &s;entiment and manly feelings. Let the&s;e men be hand&s;omely rewarded by that nation whom they &s;o materially &s;erve, and the co|lony which they &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly protect; but let their &s;alaries be a&s;certained, without depending on the blood and &s;weat of the mi&s;erable Africans. Then let &s;uch men enact impartial regulations, by which the negro &s;laves are to perform no more than their fair ta&s;k and labour a rea|&s;onable number of hours in the twenty-four: let the&s;e be followed by protecting laws, and let them be no longer racked, tormented, wantonly murdered, or infamou&s;ly rob|bed of all that is dear to the human affections, their wives and daughters. Let regulations be adopted, by which they may be properly fed, and attended to when &s;ick or indi&s;po&s;ed; and, above all, let equal ju&s;tice be admini&s;|tered; &s;uffer them, when outraged or plundered, to obtain a hearing; permit them to complain, and enable them to prove by <HI>evidence</HI> the grievances by which they are op|pre&s;&s;ed. Even give them what we &s;o much value our|&s;elves, AN INDEPENDANT JUDGE, and AN IMPARTIAL JURY, nay, partly compo&s;ed of their own &s;able compa|nions. Thus, would you have them work and act like <HI>men,</HI> fir&s;t &s;uffer them to be <HI>&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>When regulations conform to the&s;e &s;hall be adopted and enforced, then I venture to &s;ay, that nations will feel the benefit of their colonies&mdash;then planters will become rich, and their over&s;eers become hone&s;t; then &s;lavery will be little
<PB N="363" REF="421">
more than a name; and &s;ubjects will, with plea&s;ure, fulfil their limited ta&s;k: then, and not till then, will population &s;ufficiently encrea&s;e for the nece&s;&s;ary work, and the exe|crable <HI>Guinea</HI> trade be <HI>totally</HI> aboli&s;hed, which is now too frequently carried on with barbarity and unbounded u&s;ur|pation. Then the ma&s;ter will with plea&s;ure look on his &s;able &s;ubjects as on his children, and the principal &s;ource of his happine&s;s, while the negroes will ble&s;s the day their ance&s;tors did fir&s;t &s;et foot on <HI>American</HI> ground.</P>
<P>Having thus, according to my opinion, pointed out the way, and the only way (if well con&s;idered) to redre&s;s the grievances of this and many other colonies, I would al&s;o recommend to <HI>planters</HI> and <HI>over&s;eers</HI> in general, to peru&s;e with attention a &s;mall work, entitled
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Letters to a young Planter; or Ob&s;ervations on the Management of a Sugar Plantation: to which is added, the Planter's Calendar. Written on the I&s;land of Grenada, by an old Planter,"</Q>
and publi&s;hed in London in 1785, 8vo. price One Shilling and Sixpence, and &s;old by <HI>Strachan.</HI></P>
<P>Let them next take an example by that incomparable woman Mrs. <HI>Godefroy,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Thomas Palmer,</HI> and a few others, who con&s;ider their &s;laves as their fellow-creatures, without paying the &s;malle&s;t regard either to their paga|ni&s;m or complexion; and who increa&s;e both their wealth and their happine&s;s by their humanity.&mdash;I will now once more proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>On the 16th, being invited to dine with his excellency the governor, I laid before him my collection of draw|ings,
<PB N="364" REF="422">
and remarks on the colony of Surinam, which I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him honour with the highe&s;t approbation. I then returned him my thanks, not only for the material a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had afforded me in com|pleting this work, but for the unlimited marks of regard and di&s;tinction with which he had treated me from fir&s;t to la&s;t, during the whole time I re&s;ided in Guiana.</P>
<P>Availing my&s;elf of his friend&s;hip, I ventured, two days after, to give him the following very uncommon <HI>reque&s;t,</HI> praying him to lay it before the court; which, with a &s;mile on his countenance, and a hearty &s;hake by the hand, he actually promi&s;ed me to perform; <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>Having now done the utmo&s;t that lay in <HI>my</HI> power, I for &s;everal days waited the re&s;ult with anxiety, but with|out meeting with the &s;malle&s;t hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; thus, with a broken heart, I was obliged at la&s;t to give him (&s;weet fellow) over for lo&s;t, or take him with me to Europe, which mu&s;t have been plunging a dagger in the bo&s;om of his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="423">While I remained in this &s;ituation, the tran&s;port &s;hips were put in commi&s;&s;ion on the 26th for our depar|ture, and I my&s;elf ordered as one of the commi&s;&s;aries to &s;ee them wooded and watered; the officers were al&s;o cleared their arrears, and thirteen men di&s;charged at their own de&s;ire, to pu&s;h their fortune at Paramaribo. I ought here not to omit, that the indu&s;trious Colonel Fourgeoud once more paid us all in paper, by which, as u&s;ual, we lo&s;t ten <HI>per cent.</HI>; which, by letting the Jews have the gold and &s;ilver, he prudently lodged in his own pocket; and while the many hundreds of florins allowed us by government to defray exci&s;e duties, taxes, &amp;c. were never brought to account, or, rather, we were forbidden to enquire after them at all. The&s;e were trifles indeed, when divided among &s;o many gentlemen; but, in <HI>one</HI> &s;olid ma&s;s, they were no contemptible picking.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of March a &s;erjeant arrived from the camp at the Ca&s;&s;eepore Creek, in Rio Cottica, where the la&s;t-arrived troops were hourly dying away; and brought the almo&s;t incredible account, that the man I mentioned to have been <HI>lo&s;t in the woods</HI> on the 10th of February, was actually returned, after having been mi&s;&s;ing <HI>&s;ix-and-twenty days,</HI> nine of which he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on a few pounds of ru&s;k bi&s;cuit, and &s;eventeen on nothing at all but water. He added, that he had entirely lo&s;t his voice, and was reduced to a perfect &s;keleton: however, by the care taken of him by the officers, there were &s;till hopes of his life. Should

any per&s;on he&s;itate to believe this extraordinary fact, let them read <HI>Mon&s;ieur Godin</HI>'s well-authenticated letter to his friend <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Condamine,</HI> wherein he gives an account of the dreadful &s;ufferings of his lady during her route from <HI>Rio Hamba</HI> to <HI>Laguna,</HI> through the woods of South America, in October 1769; where a delicate woman, after being de&s;erted by the Indian guides, and after both her brothers had fallen martyrs to their hard|&s;hips and mi&s;ery, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted <HI>ten days</HI> alone in a wild fore&s;t without food, without knowing where &s;he was, and &s;ur|rounded with tigers, &s;erpents, and dangers of every de|&s;cription: I &s;ay, let them only read the narrative of this lady's &s;ufferings, and their credulity will no longer be &s;taggered at what I my&s;elf have related. I have, in|deed, even omitted facts, which, on account of their &s;ingularity, mu&s;t in the eyes of &s;ome have appeared to border on the marvellous. But in the fore&s;ts of South America &s;uch extraordinary realities are to be found, that there is a&s;&s;uredly no need to have recour&s;e to fiction or the lea&s;t exaggeration.</P>
<P>Who, for in&s;tance, would believe, that almo&s;t a whole detachment of eighty marines, one day marching through a thick wood, imagined to a man that they were &s;tepping one after another over a large fallen tree, that ob&s;tructed their way; till at length it began to move, and proved to be no other than a full grown &s;erpent of the <HI>aboma</HI> kind, mea&s;uring, according to Colonel Fourgeoud's computa|tion, between <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>forty</HI> feet in length? yet this
<PB N="367" REF="425">
is an indubitable truth. The above animal was neither killed nor hurt; the Colonel ordering the remaining party to form in a half circle and march around it, in order that they them&s;elves at the &s;ame time might e&s;|cape every danger from the mon&s;ter's matchle&s;s &s;trength.</P>
<P>In this place I &s;hall mention another extraordinary circum&s;tance, which is, that one morning Colonel Four|geoud re&s;ting in his hammock, with one hand carele&s;sly leaning over the &s;ide, a large <HI>rattle-&s;nake</HI> that lay coiled up among the long gra&s;s which was under it, was actually &s;evered in two by the &s;entinel, during the very moment of action that it made a &s;pring to bite him: of which the &s;oldier, who&s;e name was <HI>John Kiefhaber,</HI> had been appri&s;ed fir&s;t by the &s;ound of its rattle, and next by &s;eeing the &s;nake's head erected, while it was brandi&s;hing its forked tongue.</P>
<P>As I am treating of the&s;e reptiles, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of in&s;erting a fact, which I learned from Mr. <HI>Francis Rowe</HI> of Philadelphia, a re&s;pectable old man; who informed me, that riding out one morning to vi&s;it a friend, his hor&s;e refu&s;ed to go forward, being terrified at a large rattle-&s;nake that lay acro&s;s the road. Mr. Rowe having heard of its power of fa&s;cination, in which he was a believer, alighted to lead the animal round it; but during that time the &s;nake, having coiled him&s;elf up, &s;ounded its rattle, and &s;tared him &s;o full in the face, and with &s;uch fire in its eyes, that the cold &s;weat broke out upon him; thus, whil&s;t he dur&s;t neither retreat or advance,
<PB N="368" REF="426">
he imagined him&s;elf gradually rivetted to the &s;pot.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"However," continued he,

<P>On the 3d of March my friend de Graaf &s;ailed for Hol|land, but fir&s;t for St. Eu&s;tatia, where his brother was governor; and to my great &s;atisfaction took with him Joanna's younge&s;t brother, <HI>Henry,</HI> for whom he has &s;ince obtained his freedom. I &s;ailed with them down the river as far as Bram's Point, and wi&s;hed them a &s;ucce&s;sful voyage. As I here went a&s;hore in a fi&s;hing-boat, I was tempted to leap into the &s;ea, and enjoy the cooling and healthy plea&s;ure of &s;wimming in the At|lantic ocean. The fi&s;her-men having caught a quantity of large fi&s;h, I di&s;covered one among them not yet men|tioned in my narrative, this was the <HI>yellow-back,</HI> between two and three feet long, thus called from its colour, which almo&s;t re&s;embles that of a lemon, but the belly is white: the head is very large, with two long barbs; but the body is &s;mall, and without &s;cales, like the cod; it is, however, not near &s;o good, being coar&s;e and in&s;ipid eating. Two other &s;mall fi&s;hes I al&s;o &s;aw in the boat, the one called here the <HI>weepee,</HI> re&s;embling a whip-la&s;h; he other <HI>waracoo,</HI> which is a delicate eating, but has nothing in its form or habits de&s;erving a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The 8th of March, being the Prince of Orange's birth|day,

it was celebrated at the head quarters; where, after dinner, in the court ledge, hearing Captain <HI>Bolts</HI> in an unde&s;erved manner cen&s;ured by the colonel's adjutant, for recommending one of the young volunteers of an ex|cellent character, but who had no friends to &s;upport him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Mr. <HI>Sheffer,</HI> already named, who had &s;erved with honour from fir&s;t to la&s;t, on the pay of a private &s;oldier, during this painful expedition.</NOTE>, I broke through the ring that &s;urrounded them in a pa&s;|&s;ion, and not being able to re&s;train my&s;elf, publicly re|proved the aggre&s;&s;or, even in Fourgeoud's pre&s;ence, when a furious altercation and very high words immediately en&s;ued; the con&s;equence of which was, that next morn|ing at &s;un-ri&s;e <HI>we</HI> walked to the &s;avannah without &s;e|conds, where, near the gallows, we drew our &s;mall &s;words, and after making a few pa&s;&s;es at each other, Captain Van Geurick's point met my &s;hell, which having nearly pierced, his blade &s;napped in two pieces, and the fortune of war put him entirely in my power. Di&s;daining, how|ever, to take a mean advantage, I in&s;tantly dropped my &s;mall &s;word, and de&s;ired him to &s;tep home and re|place his own, in order to renew the battle: but this propo&s;al he was plea&s;ed to call &s;o generous, that taking me by the hand, he reque&s;ted a renewal of friend&s;hip; thus acknowledging we had been too ha&s;ty on both &s;ides, we went to vi&s;it poor Bolts, who knew nothing of our morning's walk, and was (though not without difficulty) per&s;uaded al&s;o to enter into the amicable treaty: by which a &s;econd rencounter was happily prevented, and a ge|neral reconciliation took place.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="428">On the 10th, having &s;pent mo&s;t of the day with the governor, I in the evening went on board the &s;hips with Captain Bolts, to in&s;pect the preparations for the voyage; where we found that the mice and rats had made &s;uch havock among our provi&s;ion, with which we were <HI>now</HI> very well &s;tocked, that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|curing half a dozen <HI>cats</HI> to de&s;troy them, which u&s;eful animals are in Surinam neither &s;o plenty, nor &s;o good, as in Europe, being lazy and indolent, on account of the climate.

<P>By the laws of the country, however, &s;he was not only obliged to &s;ubmit, but at <HI>his</HI> de&s;ire was condemned, for di&s;obedience, together with her poor mother, and all her

<P>Such were the fatal con&s;equences of not having been timely emancipated; and &s;uch were they indeed, that they made me tremble for my little boy. Happily my unea&s;ine&s;s was not of long duration; for, however impro|bable and unexpected, I was &s;urprized on the very &s;ame day with a polite me&s;&s;age from the governor and the court, acquainting me that,

<P>No man could be more &s;uddenly tran&s;ported from woe to happine&s;s than I was at this moment; while his poor mother &s;hed tears for joy and gratitude; the more &s;o, as we had lo&s;t all hopes, and the favour came perfectly un|expected,

<P>What is mo&s;t extraordinary indeed is, that while the well-thinking few highly applauded my &s;en&s;ibility, many not only blamed, but publicly derided me for my paternal affection, which was called a weakne&s;s, a whim. So extra|vagant was my joy on this day, however, at having acted the rever&s;e part of <HI>Inkle</HI> to <HI>Yarico,</HI> that I became like one frantic with plea&s;ure.

<P><PB N="373" REF="431">On the 18th Colonel Fourgeoud's remaining troops at la&s;t came down from the encampments at Ca&s;&s;eepore Creek, and every preparation was made for our departure. At the &s;ame time, the extacy of the few &s;urviving ma|rines at their quitting this country was &s;o great, having now al&s;o received part of their clearance, that &s;uch intem|perance, riot, and di&s;order en&s;ued as produced the mo&s;t formidable quarrels between them and the troops of the Society, till, &s;ome being wounded and &s;ome being flogged, peace was finally, though with difficulty, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This &s;ame day a poor &s;ailor, while I was on board, was drowned in my pre&s;ence, who fell from the gunwale into the river, with the &s;heet anchor, which had been neg|lected to be la&s;hed to the ringbolts. I in&s;tantly leaped into a boat to try to &s;ave him, but could only get his hat; the man went to the bottom, and never more was &s;een.</P>
<P>The day of our departure now approached fa&s;t, and I gave up my hou&s;e; when, at Mrs. Godefroy's pre&s;&s;ing in|vitation, I &s;pent the few remaining moments in that which &s;he had prepared for the reception of Joanna and her boy, in her beautiful garden, charmingly &s;ituated under the &s;hade of tamarind and orange trees; which hou&s;e &s;he al&s;o had neatly furni&s;hed with every accommo|dation that could be de&s;ired, be&s;ides allowing Joanna a negro woman and a girl to attend on her for life. Thus &s;ituated, how ble&s;t &s;hould I have been in this &s;pot to end my days!&mdash;But fate ordained it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="432">On the 22d, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s with Captain <HI>Small</HI> (who was come down with leave of ab&s;ence) to wait on the Reverend Mr. Snyderhans, according to appoint|ment, but who, to both our great &s;urprize, peremptorily refu&s;ed to chri&s;ten the boy; alledging for his rea&s;on, that as I was going to Holland, I could not an&s;wer for his <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> education. We replied, that he was under two very proper guardians: the black&s;mith's &s;on (for &s;uch was this divine) per&s;i&s;ted, and we remon&s;trated, but to no purpo&s;e, for he was ju&s;t as deaf as his father's anvil, and I believe, upon my &s;oul, quite as empty as his bellows; till at length, wearied out with his fanatical impertinence, I &s;wore that I would &s;ooner &s;ee the boy die a heathen, than chri&s;tened by &s;uch a blockhead; while my friend Small could not help be&s;towing on him a hearty cur&s;e, and, &s;lapping the door with a vengeance, we departed.</P>
<P>Fea&s;ting and conviviality now prevailed once more at Paramaribo, as on our fir&s;t arrival. Grand dinners, &s;up|pers, and balls were heard of in every quarter. But I only vi&s;ited a few of my &s;elect friends, among&s;t which number had con&s;tantly been Governor Nepveu, and where, for the la&s;t time, I made one of the company at a truly magnificent entertainment, which ended the &s;cene of liberality and ho&s;pitality, for which the inhabitants of Surinam are &s;o ju&s;tly con&s;picuous; and on the 25th the baggage was &s;hipped on board the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s, indeed, were the pre&s;ents for the voyage, with which I in particular was now over&s;tocked from every quarter; and my provi&s;ions of live cattle, poultry,

wine, rum, &amp;c. &amp;c. were almo&s;t &s;ufficient to carry me round the globe: among&s;t the re&s;t, in a &s;mall bottle ca&s;e, containing liquors, I found a cry&s;tal phial filled with e&s;&s;ential <HI>oil</HI> of <HI>orange,</HI> and a parcel of what they called here <HI>tonquin beans.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t is extracted from the rind or peel of the oranges: which is done here by the tedious and laborious method of &s;queezing it between the finger and thumb.

<P>On the 26th, we took our la&s;t leave of his Excellency the Governor, <HI>en corps,</HI> as a&s;&s;uredly was his due; after which all the officers of the Society troops waited on Colonel Fourgeoud, at the head quarters, to wi&s;h us a pro&s;perous voyage to Holland, and the day was &s;pent by a regale, <HI>en militaire, viz.</HI> a dinner, as u&s;ual, of &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions; but I mu&s;t acknowledge, accompanied with as much good liquor of every kind, as Surinam could fur|ni&s;h, and a very hearty welcome.</P>
<P>I believe that now a hundred times Fourgeoud &s;hook me by the hand, declaring,

He then conducted us to the water-&s;ide, where the boats lay in waiting; and we were immediately embarked, under a general &s;alute, and colours flying, from the fortre&s;s and the ve&s;&s;els in the roads. The whole corps now having dined on board the &s;taff-&s;hip with Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes, Colonel Fourgeoud politely invited me to accompany him back to town till next morning; but which, with a broken heart, I thought be&s;t to decline.

<P>EVERY thing being at la&s;t perfectly adju&s;ted for our departure, both ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXX.</NOTE> under the command of Lieu|tenant Colonel <HI>des Borgnes,</HI> weighed anchor on the morning of the 1&s;t of April, 1777, when, with a fre&s;h breeze at E. we put to &s;ea, and kept cour&s;e N. and N. W.&mdash; Motionle&s;s and &s;peechle&s;s, I hung over the &s;hip's &s;tern till the land quite di&s;appeared. After &s;ome days, however, by con&s;iderable exertions, I got the better of my melan|choly, though not of my affection, and my mind became once more compo&s;ed and calm. What chiefly contributed to the re&s;toring of my peace, was the comfortable reflec|tion, that if I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure injured my&s;elf, I had at lea&s;t done good to a few others, by relieving three <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joanna, Johnny, and Quaco.</NOTE> innocent and de&s;erving young people from a &s;tate of bondage. Yet, for this action, I was a&s;&s;uredly mo&s;t amply
<PB N="382" REF="440">
rewarded by the pre&s;ervation of my life, principally owing to their unremitting care and attention, while &s;uch num|bers fell all around me, and more were ruined in their con&s;titution, the victims of the climate and the &s;ervice, &s;ome having lo&s;t the u&s;e of their limbs, and &s;ome of their memory; nay, one or two were entirely deprived of their mental faculties, and continued in a &s;tate of incurable in|&s;anity for ever.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, out of the number of near twelve hundred able-bodied men, not one hundred returned to their friends and their country: and perhaps not twenty among&s;t the&s;e were to be found in perfect health. A|mong the dead were (including the &s;urgeons) between twenty and thirty officers; three of which number were colonels, and one a major. So very de&s;tructive was the &s;ervice to Europeans in &s;uch a climate; and &s;uch ever mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful operations in the unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere of woods and mar&s;hes.</P>
<P>One or two remarks I mu&s;t make before I conclude this &s;ubject, which are:&mdash;Fir&s;t, that among the officers and private men who had formerly been in the We&s;t In|dies, none died, while among the whole number of above one thou&s;and privates, I can only recollect <HI>one</HI> &s;ingle ma|rine who e&s;caped from &s;ickne&s;s; and next, that of the few belonging to the corps that were now on their voyage for the Texel (tho&s;e gentlemen alone excepted, who at this time belonged to the &s;taff) I my&s;elf was the <HI>only officer</HI> who had &s;ailed out with the regiment in 1772. This la&s;t was a
<PB N="383" REF="441">
plea&s;ing reflection indeed, and which could not but render me &s;incerely thankful to Providence.</P>
<P>About the 14th of April, having pa&s;&s;ed the Tropicks, and changed cour&s;e to N. N. E. and N. E. we were becalmed for &s;ome days. I ought not to omit that when in about 15 degrees N. latitude, we &s;ailed through what is vulgarly called the <HI>Gra&s;s Sea,</HI> from its being covered over with a floating kind of green and yellow weed, called <HI>gulph weeds</HI>; &s;ome of which, when dried in the &s;un, and &s;pread between two &s;heets of paper, are very curious, re&s;embling trees, flowers, &s;hrubs, &amp;c. and in which are harboured &s;mall cru&s;taceous fi&s;h, &s;collops, mu&s;cles, and &s;hells of many thou&s;and different &s;pecies. Among the la&s;t is often found that wonderful &s;ea reptile, called the <HI>hippocampus,</HI> or &s;ea-hor&s;e, which I could compare to nothing better than the <HI>chevalier</HI> of a <HI>che&s;s-board</HI>; though it is gene|rally larger, and &s;ometimes eight or nine inches in length. The body is compo&s;ed of cartilaginous rings: the head, &s;nout, and mane are incru&s;ted all over; and the tail, which is curvated upwards in the figure of an <HI>S,</HI> termi|nates in a point.</P>
<P>On the 19th, the calm &s;till continuing, we were daily entertained by &s;warms of flying fi&s;h, and &s;everal doradoes and grampu&s;&s;es &s;wimming and tumbling before and after the &s;hips, as if delighting to keep us company. The <HI>grampus</HI> is a fi&s;h of the cetaceous kind, &s;omething re|&s;embling the dolphin, but much larger, and approaching the whale in &s;ize, &s;ome being near twenty feet in length, and prodigiou&s;ly fat. This fi&s;h has forty &s;trong teeth; is of
<PB N="384" REF="442">
a dark brown colour, and &s;pouts water with con&s;iderable force. We al&s;o &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance from the ve&s;&s;els &s;e|veral times above the water a large <HI>north-caper.</HI> This fi&s;h, which very much re&s;embles the Greenland whale, is more dangerous, on account of its being more active, which proceeds from the body being &s;maller and flatter than that of the former. The jaw is &s;horter, with very &s;mall barbs: the &s;kin is whiter, and the produce of its blubber amounts &s;eldom to more than thirty tons.</P>
<P>About the 22d, the weather began to change con&s;ider|ably, and the whole &s;hip's company were attacked with a &s;evere cold and cough, and many al&s;o with the ague.</P>
<P>On the 30th, the crew was &s;o weak as to be hardly able to do their duty; two of them indeed, and one marine, were already dead and overboard. Colonel de Borgnes was al&s;o at this time &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that the com|mand devolved upon me for a few days during his ill|ne&s;s, when ob&s;erving the other &s;hip ahead, and almo&s;t out of &s;ight, I availed my&s;elf of my commodore&s;hip, by hoi&s;ting a flag at the main-top, and firing a gun to windward to bring her to, which &s;he punctually obeyed.</P>
<P>A large <HI>&s;hark</HI> now &s;wimming along&s;ide the &s;hip, we did all that lay in our power to take it, but to no purpo&s;e. Sharks are in the&s;e &s;eas of different kinds; but what is generally called the white &s;hark is the mo&s;t terrible of its &s;pecies, on account of its &s;ize, weighing often one thou&s;and pounds, and mea&s;uring &s;ixteen or eighteen feet in length; the head, which is &s;omething depre&s;&s;ed, is large;

it has two &s;pouting holes, and prominent eyes, which it can turn in every direction, and be&s;peak the malignity of its all-devouring nature; nearly under the&s;e are its mouth and throat, of &s;uch an enormous &s;ize, that it will &s;wallow a bull-dog: its teeth, which are placed in five or &s;ix rows, are &s;o &s;harp and &s;trong, that they will &s;nap off a man's arm or his leg with ea&s;e, which has very frequently happened. The whole &s;hape of this fi&s;h is in every re|&s;pect like that of the dog-fi&s;h, found in the North Seas, with very &s;trong fins, one dor&s;al, two ventral, and two abdominal: the tail is bifurcated, the upper part being longe&s;t; the &s;kin is &s;limy, rough, and u&s;ed for what we call <HI>&s;hagreen.</HI> The &s;hark always &s;wims with velocity, but mu&s;t turn upon its &s;ide to take its prey, by which many fi&s;h e&s;cape its jaws.</P>
<P>The <HI>remora,</HI> or &s;ucking-fi&s;h, is frequently found &s;ticking to &s;harks, and to &s;hips bottoms: this fi&s;h is a&s;h-coloured, and long, about twenty inches; the body roundi&s;h, and tapering near the tail; the fins are placed as tho&s;e of the &s;hark, and the under &s;kin is projecting; its <HI>&s;ucker</HI> is, how|ever, what makes it mo&s;t remarkable, being an oval gri&s;tly plate above its head, with tran&s;ver&s;e bars, like the palate of a &s;heep. This &s;ucker has &s;o much attraction, that no waves, however violent, can beat it off.&mdash;<HI>(For both the&s;e fi&s;hes, &s;ee the Plate annexed.)</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>pilot-fi&s;h</HI> ought here al&s;o to be noticed: this is &s;mall, with brilliant colours, and is &s;aid not only to feed upon
<PB N="386" REF="445">
the gills of the &s;hark, but to direct it to its prey, from which &s;ingularity originates its name.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of May, being exactly one month at &s;ea, during which time, by way of making a trial, I had con|tinued bare-footed and bare-headed, without catching cold; I this day, for the fir&s;t time, not only dre&s;&s;ed like my &s;hip-mates, but wore every thing double, and &s;ome things triple, which I found exceedingly comfortable.</P>
<P>About this time a Mr. <HI>Ney&s;eus,</HI> one of our &s;urgeons, having on board a <HI>crabbodago</HI> or <HI>gri&s;&s;on</HI> (who&s;e ferocity I have already de&s;cribed) to carry home as a curio&s;ity, the mi&s;chievous creature broke loo&s;e, and in one night mur|dered all the monkies, parrots, poultry, and other ani|mals that were upon deck, while it drove mo&s;t of the crew who had the watch down the hatchway; till luckily one of them with a hand-&s;pike knocked out his brains.</P>
<P>On the 3d, we had hard gales and heavy &s;howers at S. E. Latitude about 40&deg;. From this time the gale daily encrea&s;ed, till the ninth, when the weather began to mo|derate.</P>
<P>We now &s;aw &s;everal porpoi&s;es, herring-gulls, &amp;c. The fir&s;t is a fi&s;h about five or &s;ix feet long, exce&s;&s;ively fat, of a blui&s;h black colour, and without &s;cales; the head has &s;mall eyes, and no gills, but a long &s;nout, and &s;harp teeth. The fins are but one dor&s;al, and two ventral, and the tail is horizontal, to enable it to leap above the water, which it does frequently to blow or breathe, at which time its &s;norting may be heard at a great di&s;tance. The
<PB N="387" REF="446">
fle&s;h of the porpoi&s;e when killed is red, and looks like &s;ome kinds of pork.</P>
<P>The <HI>herring-gull</HI> is a bird as large as a tame duck, per|fectly white, part of the beak and prime feathers except|ed, which are of a dark a&s;h-colour; the eyes are grey, the bill and feet are yellow; the claws are black, and the length of its wings is between four and five feet, from the extremity of the one to the other.</P>
<P>On the 13th, in the morning-watch, being not far from the <HI>Azores</HI> or We&s;tern I&s;les, the ve&s;&s;el was nearly laid on her beam-ends, though then under double-reefed top|&s;ails, by a &s;udden &s;quall at E. At this time a broken top|gallant-ma&s;t, a new hand-&s;pike, &amp;c. floated pa&s;t the &s;hip, the melancholy remains of a &s;hipwreck, which we &s;ince were informed to be a Dutch homeward-bound Ea&s;t Indiaman, that had foundered with all the crew near the i&s;land of <HI>Terceira.</HI></P>
<P>On the 14th the wind was violent, carrying away our fore-top-gallant-ma&s;t, and &s;plitting the main-&s;ail, while the other ve&s;&s;el lo&s;t her bow&s;prit, &amp;c.; and on the evening of the 15th it blew a perfect &s;torm, accompanied with thunder and lightening, and very heavy rain, which con|tinued during the night, and which brought our main|top-ma&s;t by the board, while the &s;hip's crew were &s;o very much reduced as to be hardly able to clear the wreck, in which I cheerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by cutting away with a hatchet.</P>
<P>The two following days we continued &s;cudding before
<PB N="388" REF="447">
the wind, with a reef in the fore-&s;ail, the &s;ea running mountains high, and con&s;tantly breaking over the ve&s;&s;el &mdash;pumps going day and night; &s;oon after which we &s;aluted the Alarm frigate from Holland, which compli|ment they returned.</P>
<P>At length, the weather becoming fair, we were carried within &s;oundings, on the 19th, when we hove the lead in ninety fathom water; but the wind &s;hifting to the N. E. with foul weather, we beat about in the chops of the Channel, till the morning of the 21&s;t, when at half pa&s;t one a &s;ignal gun was fired for the other ve&s;&s;el, that we &s;aw the light off Scilly; and at four o'clock P. M. got the pilot on board.</P>
<P>Having been becalmed two days off Dover, it was the 27th before we fir&s;t &s;aw the Dutch coa&s;t: here we purcha&s;ed &s;ome excellent fi&s;h from a <HI>Schevelin</HI> boat, with which we entertained the whole crew, though during this &s;ea voyage no &s;hip's company could be better provided.</P>
<P>Having kept off &s;hore during the night, we at la&s;t doubled <HI>Keykduyn</HI> and the <HI>Helder</HI>; and on the 28th, at three o'clock P. M. both &s;hips, under a di&s;charge of nine guns, dropped anchor in the Texel roads.</P>
<P>On the 30th, having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;mall i&s;land of <HI>Urk,</HI> in the <HI>Zuyder Sea,</HI> which is the <HI>only rock</HI> in the province of Holland, both ve&s;&s;els running before the wind with a fine breeze, <HI>premeditatedly</HI> &s;tuck fa&s;t upon the <HI>Pampus</HI>&mdash; this is a large bank of &s;oft mire, covered with &s;hoal water, and not far from Am&s;terdam, which it naturally protects
<PB N="389" REF="448">
like a barrier from all foreign invaders; &s;ince all &s;hips whatever mu&s;t either be lifted over or dragged through this bank of mud.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is done by &s;inking two concave ve&s;&s;els, called <HI>camels,</HI> which being chained together under the bottom of an Indiaman or man-of-war, of whatever burthen, the water is pumped out of them, when ri&s;ing gradually to the &s;urface with their burthen, they carry it to where there is to be found &s;ufficient depth to keep it afloat.</P>
<P>The &s;econd method is practi&s;ed on &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;i&s;ts of half a dozen &s;ail boats, called <HI>water-manakins,</HI> towing them through the mud, which can never be done but when &s;traight before the wind: at which time not only the &s;hip it&s;elf, but the boats that have her in tow, mu&s;t crowd all the &s;ail they po&s;&s;ibly can carry.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 31&s;t, having been becalmed all night, a fre&s;h breeze at E. again &s;prung up, when we fired a gun as a &s;ignal, and five or &s;ix water-manakins in&s;tantly came off, by the help of which we were dragged over the <HI>Pampus,</HI> not at the rate of fourteen knots an hour, but at that of fourteen hours a knot, &s;ince we did not get clear of it in le&s;s than three days &s;ailing, though not four miles in length: however, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the la&s;t day we had &s;carcely any wind at all.</P>
<P>During this tedious pa&s;&s;age, it was no bad entertain|ment, to ob&s;erve the contra&s;t between &s;ome newly-arrived <HI>Norwegians</HI> and us; tho&s;e people &s;itting upon deck in
<PB N="390" REF="449">
their &s;hirts, and wiping off the per&s;piration, while we were &s;trutting in great coats and fur caps, like &s;o many Mu&s;covites, to keep us from the cold.</P>
<P>Having at this time received a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent of refre&s;hments, &s;ent by the city of Am&s;terdam to the de|liverers of their favourite colony, and being &s;o near re|vi&s;iting their old friends and acquaintances, all on board were in the highe&s;t flow of &s;pirits, and exulting with gladne&s;s&mdash;excepting <HI>one!</HI>&mdash;from who&s;e mind every hap|pine&s;s was bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here &s;till relate the following &s;ingular circum|&s;tance: A man-of-war's boat coming along&s;ide the <HI>Hol|landia,</HI> the officer and crew no &s;ooner entered on board, than one of them, without &s;peaking, ran up aloft, with a knife in his teeth, to <HI>cut down the pennant.</HI> At this time Lieutenant Colonel Seyburg, pre&s;enting a mu&s;quet, and &s;wearing he would &s;hoot him out of the rigging, the poor fellow came down by the back-&s;tays like a &s;hot, to our great entertainment; next, having explained to him that both ve&s;&s;els had been put in commi&s;&s;ion by the Prince of Orange, the amazed lieutenant made a hand&s;ome apo|logy, and left the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 3d of June, every thing being in readine&s;s, the troops were put on board &s;ix lighters, appointed to tran&s;|port them to <HI>Bois-le-Duc,</HI> in which town they were next to be compleated, and do the duty as part of the gar|ri&s;on. On leaving the ve&s;&s;els we were once more &s;aluted
<PB N="391" REF="450">
with nine guns from each; which having returned with three cheers, we &s;et &s;ail for the place above mentioned. As we pa&s;&s;ed in the lighters through the inland towns, &s;uch as <HI>Saardam, Haerlem,</HI> and <HI>Tergow,</HI> I thought them truly magnificent, particularly the gla&s;s painting in the great church of the latter; but their inhabitants, who crouded about us, from curio&s;ity to &s;ee us, appeared but a di&s;gu&s;ting a&s;&s;emblage of ill-formed and ill-dre&s;&s;ed rab|ble, &s;o much had my prejudices been changed by living among the Indians and blacks: their eyes &s;eemed to re|&s;emble tho&s;e of a pig; their complexions were like the colour of foul linen; they &s;eemed to have no teeth, and to be covered over with rags and dirt. This prejudice, however, was not again&s;t the&s;e people only, but again&s;t all Europeans in general, when compared to the &s;parkling eyes, ivory teeth, &s;hining &s;kin, and remarkable cleanli|ne&s;s of tho&s;e I had left behind me. But the mo&s;t ludi|crous circum&s;tance was, that during all this we never once con&s;idered the truly extraordinary figure that we made our&s;elves, being &s;o much &s;un-burnt and &s;o pale, that we were nearly the colour of dried parchment, by heat and fatigue; and &s;o thin, that we looked like moving &s;keletons; to which I may add, that having lived &s;o long in the woods, we had perfectly the appearance of wild people; and I in particular, very de&s;ervedly, obtained the characteri&s;tic title of <HI>le Sauvage Anglois,</HI> or the Engli&s;h &s;avage.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate we arrived, on the 9th, at the town

of Bois-le-Duc, where the troops were finally di&s;em|barked.</P>
<Q><L>"Per varios ca&s;us, &amp; tot di&s;crimina rerum,</L>
<L>"Pervenimus ad Latium."&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;"Olim memini&s;&s;e juvabit."</L></Q>
<P>Thus ended, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t extraordinary ex|peditions that was ever undertaken by European troops; and to which only the exploits of the American Buccaneers have any, and even that a very di&s;tant, re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>On our arrival I found that Lieutenant Colonel <HI>We&s;|terlo,</HI> who went &s;ick to Europe, in 1773, was not yet quite recovered. This gentleman now invited me, in company with &s;ome others, to dine with him at the public me&s;s; where, while &s;ome Dutch officers complained that the &s;oup was &s;moaky, and the beef was tough, we adventurers declared that we never had ta&s;ted a more delicious repa&s;t; and at the &s;ame time, while they prai&s;ed the &s;trawberries, cherries, and other European fruits, we thought them very indifferent, and greatly inferior to the avogado-pear, the water-melon, and the pine-apple, to which we had been lately accu&s;tomed&mdash;which &s;hews that every thing in this world is only good or bad by compari&s;on.</P>
<P>The following day we were introduced, on the parade, to the Lieutenant Governor, General <HI>Hardenbrook,</HI> and &s;pent the evening at his lady's card a&s;&s;embly, where I mu&s;t acknowledge I was charmed with &s;ome very &s;weet faces, fre&s;h as the ro&s;e and the lily, while they were no le&s;s entertained with our grote&s;que appearance, though
<PB N="393" REF="454">
we had now borrowed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of powder and pomatum.</P>
<P>On the 18th the troops were finally cleared with, and paid their remaining arrears, and tho&s;e who cho&s;e it per|mitted to return to their <HI>former</HI> regiments. Some of the privates had from thirty to forty pounds to receive, which, &s;ailor-like, having earned it like hor&s;es, they &s;pent like a&s;&s;es. Among others, a young fellow of my company, who&s;e late regiment chanced to be quartered in the very &s;ame town, hired three po&s;t-chai&s;es to carry him the length of one &s;treet only, ordering a couple of drunken fiddlers in the fir&s;t, his knap&s;ack in the &s;econd, and placing him&s;elf in the third, &s;upported by a brace of the frail &s;i&s;terhood: he was, however, unfortunately &s;hipwrecked in his cour&s;e, being run foul of by the <HI>major de place,</HI> who, having broken the fiddles, and &s;et the ladies adrift, towed the roaring adven|turer him&s;elf, after a hard tug, to the quarter-guard, where he came to an anchor in the bilboes, till the gale of his di&s;&s;ipation was quite &s;pent, and he had got rid of all his cargo. In a &s;imilar manner went mo&s;t of the money which had been earned with &s;o much danger, hard&s;hip, and fatigue.</P>
<P>Now came the time to keep my long-made re&s;olution of bidding a <HI>la&s;ting farewell</HI> to Colonel Fourgeoud's regi|ment; from which, on the 10th day of Augu&s;t, I obtained my free di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, having reque&s;ted it, immediately after my debarkation, from the Prince of Orange, who at the &s;ame time honoured me with a fre&s;h Captain's
<PB N="394" REF="455">
commi&s;&s;ion in the Honourable General Stuart's regiment, which I had left in September 1772; while from that date to this very day my full pay had amounted to little more than four hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling, hav|ing regularly been &s;topped out of this &s;um <HI>ten pounds per annum</HI> for the putrid beef, pork, ru&s;k-bread, and hard pea&s;e, that &s;o miraculou&s;ly had kept &s;oul and body toge|ther.</P>
<P>Let me not, however, be con&s;idered as wi&s;hing to ca&s;t a reflection on the Dutch nation in general, who indeed omitted nothing for our pre&s;ervation and encouragement during this long and painful &s;ervice: a people who&s;e virtues have been for ages as con&s;picuous as their valour &mdash;<HI>one</HI> man alone was the cau&s;e of all our &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Having now exchanged my blue coat for a &s;carlet one, bought a very hand&s;ome hor&s;e, and put Quaco in a bril|liant livery, I for the la&s;t time entertained my &s;hip-mates, with whom, without exception, I drank an everla&s;ting friend&s;hip: then taking my final farewell of them all, I the next morning &s;et out to rejoin the old Scotch regi|ment, where I was received with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of joy and unfeigned friend&s;hip by the corps.</P>
<P>Going now to take my leave of Surinam, after all the horrors and cruelties with which I mu&s;t have hurt both the eye and the heart of the feeling reader, I will clo&s;e the &s;cene with an emblematical picture of <HI>Europe &s;up|ported by Africa and America,</HI> accompanied by an ardent wi&s;h that in the friendly manner as they are repre&s;ented,

<PB N="395" REF="457">
they may henceforth and to all eternity be the props of each other. I might have included A&s;ia, but this I omit|ted, as having no connection with the pre&s;ent narrative: we only differ in colour, but are certainly all created by the &s;ame Hand. Thus, if it has not plea&s;ed fortune to make us equal in rank and authority, let us at lea&s;t u&s;e the &s;uperiority we po&s;&s;e&s;s with moderation, and not only proffer that happine&s;s which we have to be&s;tow on our equals, but let us extend it with chearfulne&s;s to the lowe&s;t of our de&s;erving dependants.</P>
<P>On the 25th of Augu&s;t I repaired to the palace of <HI>Loo,</HI> in Guelderland, where, by the Colonel of the regiment, I was introduced to his Serene Highne&s;s the <HI>Stadtholder</HI>; who not only was plea&s;ed to give me a gracious recep|tion, remarking, that by my looks I mu&s;t have &s;uffered much, but &s;oon after promoted me to the rank of <HI>Major</HI> in the &s;ame Scotti&s;h regiment.</P>
<P>As I had now the plea&s;ure al&s;o to &s;ee a few others of my fellow &s;ufferers recompen&s;ed after their hard&s;hips, I had rea&s;on to think the le&s;s of our former troubles; thus, in|&s;tead of indulging in cen&s;ure, I found a more &s;olid con&s;o|lation in the triumph of <HI>truth,</HI> which was <HI>brought to light</HI> without my farther interference.</P>
<Q>"Magna e&s;t veritas &amp; prevalebit."</Q>
<P>On the 24th of September I went to the Hague, where I pre&s;ented his Serene Highne&s;s with <HI>eighteen figures</HI> in wax, made by my&s;elf, for his mu&s;eum, which were mo&s;t
<PB N="396" REF="458">
graciou&s;ly accepted. They repre&s;ented the free Indians of Guiana, and negro &s;laves of Surinam, engaged in dif|ferent occupations, on an i&s;land, &s;upported by a cry&s;tal mirror, and ornamented with gold.</P>
<P>I now al&s;o, with <HI>his own con&s;ent,</HI> made a pre&s;ent of my faithful black boy, Quaco, to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ro&s;en|daal,</HI> to who&s;e family I was under very great obligations; and who &s;ince, on account of his hone&s;ty and &s;ober con|duct, not only chri&s;tened him, by the name of <HI>Stedman,</HI> at my de&s;ire, but promoted him to be their butler, with a promi&s;e to take care of him as long as he lived; which was particularly grateful to me, being &s;uch advantages as I could never have procured for him my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here I cannot omit an anecdote of attachment in this boy:&mdash;Having &s;et out by my&s;elf on a &s;hort journey, I found a crown-piece more than I expected in my pur&s;e, and for which I was at a lo&s;s to account; till on my return, when I que&s;tioned Quaco, he &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that fearing I might be &s;hort of ca&s;h, where people &s;eemed &s;o fond of it, he had put his five-&s;hilling piece in my pocket."</Q>
&mdash;This action was the more generous, not only in the manner it was done, but being at that time the only crown poor Quaco po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this world.</P>
<P>About the latter end of October, I was offered by the directors of the &s;ettlement to be &s;ent over as a lieutenant governor to the colony of <HI>Berbic&egrave;,</HI> &s;ituated next to Suri|nam. In con&s;equence, I immediately went to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to wait on them, and hear the propo&s;als, in which they
<PB N="397" REF="459">
indeed offered me a higher &s;alary, and greater advantages, than they had ever offered to any other gentleman in that &s;ituation; but I in&s;i&s;ted on having either the <HI>govern|ment</HI> if I &s;urvived, or a decent <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> after a certain number of years at my return; which being out of their power, they &s;aid, to grant, I declined accepting of the offer altogether, judging it more prudent to recover my health and vigour in Europe with a Scotti&s;h company, than to parch any longer under the Torrid Zone, with|out a pro&s;pect of &s;ettling at home with honour and a competent fortune. Nor was it long before I perfectly recovered, and became as &s;tout and healthy as I had ever been in all my life: a happine&s;s of which not one among one hundred of my late &s;hip-mates could boa&s;t.</P>
<P>Among others, poor COLONEL FOURGEOUD did not long enjoy his good fortune; for he was &s;carcely arrived in Holland, with the remaining few who &s;tayed &s;ome time behind us, than his beloved <HI>pti&s;an</HI> having failed him, he was one morning found <HI>dead</HI> in his bed, attended only by a negro, and buried with military honours at the Hague.</P>
<P>Not long after this, expired al&s;o in Surinam Four|geoud's mortal enemy, the GOVERNOR of the colony; which vacancy was mo&s;t worthily filled up by Colonel <HI>Texier,</HI> and &s;ince by the de&s;erving Mr. <HI>Wichers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman having al&s;o re&s;igned, I have the plea&s;ure to acquaint my read|ers, that in the year 1792, that gallant officer, Mr. F. Fredericy (&s;o frequently mentioned in this narrative) and who had &s;ome time before re-entered into the &s;er|vice of the Society troops, was appointed Governor of the colony of Surinam.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this period nothing worth recording occurred
<PB N="398" REF="460">
till the year 1782, when the Emperor of Germany hav|ing retaken the barrier towns from the States of Holland, General Stuart's regiment was the la&s;t that evacuated the city of <HI>Namur,</HI> and on the &s;ame day the Imperial troops marched in to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: after which the Emperor ordered, in the year 1783, all the fortifications to be de|moli&s;hed. Soon after this, the Scotch brigade, the pri|vates of which now con&s;i&s;ted of all nations, was natura|lized by the States of Holland, that is, formed into three <HI>Dutch</HI> regiments, on account of the war with Great Bri|tain; and this circum&s;tance induced my&s;elf and mo&s;t of the principal officers immediately to re&s;ign&mdash;as we refu&s;ed to &s;erve again&s;t our King and Country.</P>
<P>Having thus left the Dutch &s;ervice, on which day, by the Prince of Orange, I was complimented with the rank of <HI>lieutenant-colonel,</HI> the above gentlemen went to Eng|land, where, in con&s;equence of their loyalty, they were taken under his Britannic Maje&s;ty's protection; and, on the 18th of June, eleven of them, of which number I was &s;o happy to make one, were, by General <HI>Conway,</HI> introduced at St. James's, where we had the honour to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's hand.</P>

<P>But &s;he is no more! &mdash; Reader! &mdash; the virtuous Joanna, who &s;o often &s;aved my life, is no more!!!&mdash;Her adopted mother, Mrs. Godefroy, who bedewed her beauteous body with tears, ordered it to be interred with every mark of re&s;pect, under the grove of orange-trees where &s;he had lived. Her lovely boy was &s;ent to me, with a bill of near two hundred pounds, his private property, by inheri|tance from his mother.&mdash;Soon after which expired both his very faithful guardians.</P>
