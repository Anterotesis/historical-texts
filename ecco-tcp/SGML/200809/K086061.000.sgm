<P>I. ON THE DEATH OF SAMUEL FOOTE, ESQ.</P>
<P>II. ON AGE.</P>
<P>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT, Of the Theatre Royal, Drury-Lane.</P>

<P>EVERY one who amu&s;es him&s;elf with writing Works of Imagination, has a View to either Profit or Fame. Though the Author of the fol|lowing Trifles does not pretend to be above &s;uch Mo|tives, yet he hopes his Anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one Moment, &s;hould he be en|tirely di&s;appointed. He is &s;en&s;ible how much Succe&s;s depends upon Circum&s;tances. A Poem mu&s;t be read before it can be admired; nay more, it mu&s;t be read with &s;ome Share of that Temper and Spirit in which it was written, or it will appear languid. A good Character, or a bad one, given by tho&s;e Gentlemen
<PB N="iv" REF="3">who take upon them&s;elves the Office of Public Cen|&s;ors in literary Matters, will frequently, at lea&s;t for a Time, determine its Fate. As he is entirely un|known, he is not in any Dread of a partial Sentence. If the&s;e Poems are worthle&s;s, let them re&s;t in that Oblivion which is the utmo&s;t Happine&s;s Unworthine&s;s can know: if the contrary happens to be the Ca&s;e, he has no doubt but their Merits will be &s;een and acknowledged by every one whom Heaven has ble&s;t with Ta&s;te and Judgment &s;ufficient to form the true Critic.</P>

<P>THERE is not any Thing, I believe, which calls forth the melancholy and &s;ympathetic Pa&s;&s;ions more forcibly than a Sight of tho&s;e Men who have once been great or famous, and have outlived their For|tune or Faculties. Who can forbear &s;ighing when he beholds a BELISARIUS? Who&s;e Heart is not wrung when he views a SWIFT in his Dotage?&mdash;Reflections of this Kind gave Birth to the following Stanzas. They were written upon an old Man in a Coun|try-Village, who&s;e Strength, Activity, and ru&s;tic Ac|compli&s;hments, were once the frequent Admiration of his Fellow-Swains; and when Age had deprived
<PB N="18" REF="16">him of them, and rendered him feeble and decrepid, the Remembrance of his pa&s;t Exploits was often the Subject of their Exclamations, and the hone&s;t Motive of their Pity and Condolence, as well as the frequent Topic of his own Lamentation. The Effect that this Remembrance had upon his Mind cannot, perhaps, be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the Reader that the Sentence which I have cho&s;en for a Motto was common in his Mouth, and generally attended with a Sigh.</P>
