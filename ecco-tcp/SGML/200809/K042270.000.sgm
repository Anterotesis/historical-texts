<P>THE PERPLEXITIES: A COMEDY.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of this Comedy thinks it his duty to declare that, in point of fable, he is entirely indebted to an old play, wrote by <HI>Sir Samuel Tuke,</HI> called the <HI>Adven|tures of Five Hours;</HI> of which piece <HI>Echard,</HI> in the preface to his tran&s;lation of <HI>Terence,</HI> after noticing &s;ome particular excellencies, gives this general character; viz.</P>
<Q>This is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t &s;tories, that ever appeared upon our &s;tage, and has as much variety of plots and intrigues, without any thing being precipitated, im|proper, or unnatural, as to the main action.</Q>
<P>This encomium, and the reque&s;t of a par|ticular friend, induced an attempt to re&s;tore &s;o excellent a &s;tory to the &s;tage. Finding, on examination of the original, the language to con&s;i&s;t entirely of mea&s;ure and rhyme, a &s;tyle by no means &s;uited to the u&s;e of come|dy, it appeared indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>new-write</HI> it. This arduous ta&s;k was not undertaken without much fear and diffidence. If the piece, as it now &s;tands, &s;hould be for|tunate enough to meet the lea&s;t favour, the editor will, with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, charge &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s to his having, in <HI>general,</HI> adhered clo&s;ely to the <HI>Original,</HI> pur&s;ued the
<PB REF="3">
&s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of &s;cenery, and pre&s;erved as many of the &s;entiments as could be intro|duced, without clogging, or interrupting the action. What <HI>particular</HI> alterations he has pre&s;umed to make, are, with great deference, &s;ubmitted to the Candour of the Public.</P>
<P>Since the copy was delivered to the pre&s;s, &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages have been &s;hortened in repre&s;entation, which are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h|able by the attentive reader.</P>
<P>&tristar; This Comedy having been treated with very di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of candour and encouragement, in the repre&s;entation, the Editor thinks it his duty to return his mo&s;t grateful thanks to the Public.</P>

<L>I Speak a Prologue!&mdash;What &s;trange whim, I wonder,</L>

<L>If like that <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> I could write, and &s;peech it,</L>
<L>I might command applau&s;e, and not be&s;eech it.</L>
<L>But, &s;ure, for one who, all his live-long days,</L>
<L>Has dealt in Crotchets, Minims, and Sol-fa's,</L>
<L>A Singer, to &s;tand forth in Wit's defence,</L>
<L>And plead 'gain&s;t Sound the &s;olemn cau&s;e of Sen&s;e;</L>

<L>No Prologue, &s;ir, for me,&mdash;unle&s;s in Song.</L>

<L>The fame (quoth I) you poets reap,</L>
<L>And all your gains, are owing,</L>
<L>To &s;ounds that even mea&s;ure keep,</L>

<L>I'm always us'd to follow.</L>

<L>"Sir (&s;ays he) you'll mar</L>

<L>If for old-fa&s;hion'd tunes he's not too nice,</L>
<L>I'd give him fifty of 'em in a trice,</L>

<L>E're tryal begins the Prologue's a debt,</L>
<L>A debt on demand&mdash;&s;o take what we owe.</L>

<L>And this is the way, Mr. Author,</L>
<L>To trick a plain mu&s;e up with art,</L>
<L>In modi&s;h Fal-lal's you mu&s;t cloathe her,</L>
<L>And warm a cold Critic's hard heart.</L>
<L>With a Fal-lal-lal, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherefore I thus entreat, with due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Between the bard and me you'd make deci&s;ion.</L>

<L>Which none of us dare deny.</L>

<LG>
<L>For, howe'er cruel critics and witlings may &s;neer,</L>
<L>That at times I, alas! &s;omewhat <HI>dunny</HI> appear,</L>
<L>If to you, my be&s;t friends, I e'er <HI>turn my deaf ear,</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRIQUEZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO more, cou&s;in, I be&s;eech you; all your rhetoric will not per&s;uade me to leave &s;o important a care, as the honour of our family, to the caprice of a giddy girl. It was a charge committed ab&s;olutely to me, by our pa|rents, on their death-bed, and I alone mu&s;t be an&s;werable for any blemi&s;h on that honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt, Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> but that this your extreme ha&s;te takes it's ri&s;e from pru|dence; but may not even our virtues be &s;ometimes over&s;train'd, and have their dangerous effects?
<PB N="2" REF="8">
'Tis from this fear, that I have often pre&s;um'd to interpo&s;e, and mu&s;t repeat it; wou'd it not be better to let your &s;i&s;ter &s;ee, and make her&s;elf acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of, the man with whom &s;he is to pa&s;s her life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is, in other words, to give her more opportunity for devices, and to try whether &s;he cannot fru&s;trate my de&s;igns&mdash;no, no,&mdash;an agreeable young girl &s;hou'd never be left to her own direction;&mdash;tricks, plots, and contrivances are &s;o innate in them, they will couzen them&s;elves rather than their imaginations &s;hou'd want em|ployment; I have &s;een too many in&s;tances of their vanity, giddine&s;s, ingratitude; well&mdash;well!&mdash;I have, within this hour, receiv'd intelligence from the Marquis <HI>d'Olivera,</HI> thro' who&s;e generous inter|vention my de&s;igns are, at la&s;t, come to maturity, that the per&s;on, to whom &s;he has been &s;o long contracted, Don <HI>Antonio de Mendoza&mdash;</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he the man? The very name removes half my objections. Why has it been &s;o long concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I wou'd not give my &s;i&s;ter's enter|pri&s;ing genius either time, or means, to counter|act my purpo&s;es&mdash;but now, the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion of the whole affair renders that &s;ecrecy no longer nece&s;&s;ary; this evening he will arrive from <HI>Flanders;</HI> and &s;o well convinc'd am I of the propriety of my conduct, I will not &s;leep, till they are married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his undoubted merit, I cannot yet be reconcil'd to that unrea&s;onable cu&s;|tom of contracting per&s;ons, who never &s;aw each other; compelling them to be of the &s;ame opinion, in the mo&s;t important concern of life, before you know whether they cou'd agree about the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd only compel her to her good, and think I am the be&s;t judge what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue.&mdash;Opinions indeed!&mdash;If you, Don <HI>Juan,</HI> delay the di&s;po&s;al of your &s;i&s;ter in marriage, till &s;he is able to determine what her opinion is, or (to expre&s;s my&s;elf conformably to your ea&s;y tem|per) till &s;he has fix'd her affections, &s;he may give you a brother-in-law very ill &s;uited to your choice, and judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange! that your under&s;tanding, edu|cation, and travels, &s;hou'd not have allay'd that &s;evere opinion of women; by &s;trangers imputed to us as a national fault, and indeed with too much ju&s;tice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Per&s;ons, who cannot comprehend the mo|tives, which actuate &s;uch as are wi&s;er than them|&s;elves, ever make &s;trange interpretations of their conduct. I am determin'd no longer to endure the daily, the hourly anxieties, and fears, which a &s;olicitude for <HI>Honoria</HI>'s conduct has given me; this night they end.</P>
</SP>

<P>I have had the like charge of a &s;i&s;ter, you know, the&s;e thirteen years, and cannot recol|lect a pain mine ever gave to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The compari&s;on don't hold; their di&s;po|&s;itions are different; yet, I wi&s;h, Don <HI>Juan,</HI> you may not &s;uffer for your ea&s;ine&s;s of temper; you give the reins too much into your &s;i&s;ter's hands; the thoughtle&s;sne&s;s of youth, and pa&s;&s;ions un|controul'd, may lead her far a&s;tray; 'tis too much to be fear'd; I have &s;trong rea&s;ons, have nicely weigh'd her conduct&mdash;you may repent&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you allude to; but the tran&s;actions of that fatal night are far from alarm|ing me about <HI>Felicia</HI>'s conduct; 'tis true, Don <HI>Pedro</HI> was kill'd under my balcony; you throw the deed on <HI>Florio,</HI> and his flight &s;eems to ju&s;tify the ac|cu&s;ation; yet, what reproach does this ca&s;t on

her? For when I offer'd, in con&s;equence of your a&s;&s;ertion, that he had di&s;honourable de&s;igns on her, to interfere with you in his behalf, to &s;top the pro&s;ecution, and give her hand to him, if her happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted therein, &s;he utterly declin'd it; a&s;&s;uring me &s;he had no one motive to wi&s;h for &s;uch an event, but many to avoid it.</P>

<P>You are too blind.</P>

<P>I therefore cannot, will not doubt her. Her heart is generous and hone&s;t; on &s;uch di&s;po|&s;itions, indulgence weighs more than &s;everity; and cou'd you be induc'd to alter your conduct towards <HI>Honoria&mdash;</HI>but I a&s;k pardon; your own judgment mu&s;t be your director; &s;hort as my ab|&s;ence has been, events may have occur'd, which may render me now an incompetent advi&s;er.&mdash;Your &s;i&s;ter is mi&s;tre&s;s of many virtues; and fame &s;peaks loudly of <HI>Antonio,</HI> as a man, a &s;cholar, and a &s;oldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>On tho&s;e con&s;iderations, let our argument die. I am determin'd. Will you accompany me to our friend and kin&s;man the corregidor? I wou'd require him to be a witne&s;s, and partaker of our ceremonies to-night.</P>

<P>You never fail to do that.&mdash;Your every look, and word, has affection in it; and that agreeable manner of &s;etting them off, makes what wou'd be &s;til'd levity in others, a virtue in you, as it's only &s;pring is from a de&s;ire to entertain.</P>

<P>Why that's true&mdash;and it is &s;ometimes other|wi&s;e; but as I have not to charge fortune, or friends, with any actual affliction, I bear accidental ills as well as I am able, and endeavour to keep &s;orrow at arm's length.

<P>Oh! no&mdash;you forget&mdash;I had the credit of the victory over him&mdash;As &s;oon as he began to u&s;e violence, I &s;eiz'd his dagger, and menac'd his de&s;truction, (ay and meant it too) when a &s;udden alarm, and fear for his own &s;afety, reliev'd me from the mon&s;ter.</P>

<P>Your attachments to your relation, the Count <HI>D'Oniate,</HI> and the concern your brother had in his emba&s;&s;y to the emperor, threaten'd &s;urely a longer ab&s;ence. What occa&s;ion'd your return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother was &s;uddenly recall'd to his regiment, by royal command; and the nece&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing di&s;patch in our return to <HI>Sevil,</HI> induc'd him to take the neare&s;t road&mdash;too near the enemies quarters&mdash;and thence we were made pri&s;oners.</P>

<P>This is the man, to whom you are contrac|ted; and, to aggravate our perplexities, the very hero, who pre&s;erv'd my life, and honour; tho', I begin to fear, at the expence of my happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>His behaviour, and motives, then are well explain'd&mdash;The man, to whom I was engag'd, has been a witne&s;s to my concealment, my &s;hame&mdash;my pa&s;&s;ion for another&mdash;and he has u&s;ed this means
<PB N="55" REF="61">
to bring me to my abandon'd home, that he and my unnatural brother, may wreak their cruel ven|geance on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all amazement&mdash;How came you into his hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>Florio,</HI> to whom he proves an intimate friend, entru&s;ted me to his care; tho' till this mo|ment, I never heard his name;&mdash;that might have alarm'd me&mdash;but every &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance con|curs to ruin me.&mdash;</P>

<P>But were you di&s;tracted, to let him bring you here, or blind, not to know your own hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could I in &s;uch darkne&s;s, &s;uch fear, &s;uch confu&s;ion? be&s;ide, he brought me in the back way, thro' his own quarter, and had the lights put out, before he introduc'd me&mdash;Well, I am pre|par'd to &s;uffer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Antonio'</HI> has done the &s;ame, in your ab&s;ence; and, on your account, I did not di&s;abu&s;e him. He has renew'd his vows of love with equal ardour, as when he fir&s;t &s;aw me, and &s;eem'd tran&s;ported to di&s;cover his de&s;tin'd wife in the woman whom he re&s;cued. There hangs your hope, and mine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vain &s;ugge&s;tion! What hope can we have, while this cruel contract remains &s;uch a bar to our general happine&s;s?&mdash;Be&s;ides, he has &s;een my bro|ther by this time&mdash;the whole is out&mdash;and ruin cer|tain.</P>
