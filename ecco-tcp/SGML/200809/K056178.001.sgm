<P>I AM indeed, my dear George, the mo&s;t happy of human beings; happy in the paternal regard of the be&s;t of pa|rents, the &s;incere e&s;teem of my worthy re|lations, lord and lady Belmont; and the friend&s;hip, the tender friend&s;hip of their
<PB N="2" REF="4">
lovely daughter, the amiable lady Julia. An encrea&s;e of fortune, which you are kind enough to wi&s;h me, might perhaps add &s;omething to my felicity, but is far from being nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute it, nor did it ever excite in my bo&s;om an anxious wi&s;h. My father, though he educated me to be|come the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ituation, yet in|&s;tructed me to be &s;atisfied with my own moderate one; he taught me that inde|pendence was all a generous mind re|quired; and that virtue, adorned by that liberal education his un&s;paring bounty lavi&s;hed on me, would command through life that heart-felt e&s;teem from the worthy of every rank, which the mo&s;t exorbitant wealth alone could never procure its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors. Other parents hoard up riches for their children; mine with a more no|ble, more enlightened &s;olicitude, expend|ed his in &s;toring my mind with generous &s;entiments and u&s;eful knowledge, to which his
<PB N="3" REF="5">
unbounded goodne&s;s added every out|ward accompli&s;hment that could give grace to virtue, and &s;et her charms in the fair|e&s;t light.</P>
<P>Shall I then murmur becau&s;e I was not born to affluence? No, believe me, I would not be the &s;on of any other than this mo&s;t excellent of men, to inherit all the &s;tores which avarice and ambition &s;igh for: I am prouder of a father to who&s;e di&s;cern|ing wi&s;dom, and generous expanded heart, I am &s;o obliged, than I &s;hould be of one whom I was to &s;ucceed in all the titles and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the power of fortune to be|&s;tow. From him I receive, and learn pro|perly to value, the mo&s;t real of all trea|&s;ures, independence and content.</P>
<P>What a divine morning? how lovely is the face of nature! The blue &s;erene of Italy, with the lively verdure of England.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
But behold a more charming object than nature her&s;elf! the &s;weet, the young, the blooming lady Julia, who is this in&s;tant &s;tepping into her po&s;t chai&s;e with lady Anne Wilmot. How un&s;peakably lovely! &s;he looks up to the window, &s;he &s;miles; I under&s;tand that &s;mile, &s;he permits me to have the honour of following her: I'll order my hor&s;es, and whil&s;t they are getting ready, endeavour to de&s;cribe this mo&s;t angelic of woman kind.</P>
<P>Lady Julia then, who wants only three months of nineteen, is exactly what a poet or painter would wi&s;h to copy who intend|ed to per&s;onify the idea of female &s;oftne&s;s; her whole form is delicate and feminine to the utmo&s;t degree: her complexion is fair, enlivened by the bloom of youth, and of|ten diver&s;ifyed by blu&s;hes more beautiful than tho&s;e of the morning: her features are regular, her mouth and teeth particu|larly
<PB N="5" REF="7">
lovely; her hair light brown; her eyes blue, full of &s;oftne&s;s, and &s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of her &s;oul. Her countenance, the beauteous abode of the loves and the &s;miles, has a mixture of &s;weetne&s;s and &s;pirit which gives life and expre&s;&s;ion to her charms.</P>
<P>As her mind has been adorned, not warped, by education, it is ju&s;t what her appearance promi&s;es; artle&s;s, gentle, ti|mid, &s;oft, &s;incere, compa&s;&s;ionate; awake to all the finer impre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, and melting with pity for every human|woe.</P>
<P>But my hor&s;es are in the court, and even this &s;ubject cannot detain me a mo|ment longer. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>YOUR raillery, my dear Mordaunt, gives me pain; that I have the ten|dere&s;t attachment to lady Julia is certain, but it is an attachment which has not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to love. I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful of mankind to make &s;o ill a return to the friend&s;hip lord Bel|mont honours me with, and the mo&s;t &s;elf|i&s;h to entertain a wi&s;h &s;o much to lady Julia's di&s;advantage. My birth, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is not unworthy even her, &s;ince the &s;ame blood fills our veins, my father being de&s;cended from the elde&s;t bro|ther of the fir&s;t earl of Belmont, great grandfather of the pre&s;ent: but it would ill become a man who&s;e whole expectations are limited to the inheritance of 700l. a year (long very long, may it be before the greate&s;t of all misfortunes makes even
<PB N="7" REF="9">
that little mine) to a&s;pire to the heire&s;s of twice as many thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>What I feel for this mo&s;t charming of women is the tenderne&s;s of a relation, mixed with that &s;oft and lively e&s;teem which it is impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e to the fine&s;t under&s;tanding and noble&s;t mind in the world, lodged in a form almo&s;t cele&s;tial.</P>
<P>Love, for I have ta&s;ted its poi&s;oned cup, is all tumult, di&s;order, madne&s;s; but my friend&s;hip for lady Julia, warm and animated as it is, is calm, tranquil, gen|tle; productive of a thou&s;and innocent plea&s;ures, but a &s;tranger to every kind of inquietude: it does not even di&s;turb my re&s;t, a certain con&s;equence of love, even in its earlie&s;t approaches.</P>
<P>Having thus vindicated my&s;elf from all &s;u&s;picion of a pa&s;&s;ion, which in the pre&s;ent
<PB N="8" REF="10">
&s;ituation of my fortune I &s;hould think al|mo&s;t a criminal one, I proceed to obey you in in giving you the portraits of my noble friends, though, I a&s;&s;ure you, my &s;ketches will be very imperfect ones.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont, who lives eight months of the year at this charming &s;eat, with all the magnificence and ho&s;pitality of our ancient Engli&s;h nobility, is about &s;ixty years old; his per&s;on is tall, well made, graceful; his air commanding, and full of dignity: be has &s;trong &s;en&s;e, with a competent &s;hare of learning, and a ju&s;t and delicate ta&s;te for the fine arts; e&s;pecially mu&s;ick, which he &s;tudyed in Italy under the be&s;t ma&s;ters that region of harmony afforded. His politene&s;s is equally the re&s;ult of a natural de&s;ire of obliging, and an early and exten&s;ive acquaintance with the great world.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
A liberality which &s;carce his ample po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions can bound, a paternal care of all placed by Providence under his protection, a glowing zeal for the liberty, pro&s;perity, and honour of his country, the noble&s;t &s;pirit of independence, with the mo&s;t ani|mated attachment and firme&s;t loyalty to his accompli&s;hed &s;overeign, are traits too &s;trongly marked to e&s;cape the mo&s;t care|le&s;s ob&s;erver, but tho&s;e only who are ad|mitted to his neare&s;t intimacy are judges of his dome&s;tick virtues, or &s;ee in full light the tender, the polite, attentive hu&s;band, the fond indulgent parent, the warm un|wearied friend.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;hade in this picture, it is a prejudice, perhaps rather too &s;trong, in favour of birth, and a &s;lowne&s;s to expect very exalted virtues in any man who can|not trace his ance&s;tors as far back, at lea&s;t, as the conque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
Lady Belmont, who is about &s;ix years younger than her lord, with all the &s;trength of rea&s;on and &s;teadine&s;s of mind generally confined to the be&s;t of our &s;ex, has all the winning &s;oftne&s;s becoming the mo&s;t ami|able of her own; gentle, affable, &s;ocial, polite, &s;he joins the graces of a court to the &s;implicity of a cottage; and by an inexpre&s;&s;ible ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s in her ad|dre&s;s, makes all who approach her hap|py: impartial in her politene&s;s, at her ge|nial board no invidious di&s;tinctions take place, no cold regards damp the heart of an inferior: by a peculiar delicacy of good breeding, and engaging attention to eve|ry individual, &s;he bani&s;hes re&s;erve, and diffu&s;es a &s;pirit of convivial joy around her: encouraged by her notice the timid lo&s;e their diffidence in her pre&s;ence, and often &s;urprized exert talents of plea&s;ing they were before them&s;elves uncon&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
The be&s;t, and mo&s;t beloved of wives, of mothers, of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, her dome&s;tick character is mo&s;t lovely; indeed all her virtues are rendered doubly charming, by a certain grace, a delicate fini&s;hing, which it is much ea&s;ier to feel than to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The oeconomy of her hou&s;e, which &s;he does not di&s;dain her&s;elf to direct, is magnificent without profu&s;ion, and regular without con&s;traint: The effects of her cares appear, the cau&s;e is unob&s;erved; all wears the &s;miling ea&s;y air of chance, though conducted with the mo&s;t admirable order.</P>
<P>Her form is perfectly elegant; and her countenance, without having ever been beautiful, has a benignity in it more en|gaging than beauty it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
Lady Anne Wilmot, my father, and my&s;elf, make up the pre&s;ent party at Bel|mont. Lady Anne, who without regularity of features has that animation which is the &s;oul of beauty, is the widow of a very rich country gentleman; if it be ju&s;t to pro&s;|titute the name of gentleman to beings of his order, only becau&s;e they have e&s;tates of which they are unworthy, and are de|&s;cended from ance&s;tors whom they di&s;|honour; who when riding po&s;t through Europe, happened to &s;ee her with her fa|ther at Turin; and as &s;he was the hand|&s;ome&s;t Engli&s;h woman there, and the whim of being marryed ju&s;t then &s;eized him, a&s;ked her of Lord &mdash;, who could not re|fu&s;e his daughter to a jointure of 3000<HI>l.</HI> a year. She returned &s;oon to England with her hu&s;band, where during four years &s;he enjoyed the happine&s;s of li&s;tening to the intere&s;ting hi&s;tories of the chace, and entertaining the&mdash;&s;hire hunt at dinner: her
<PB N="13" REF="15">
&s;lumbers broke by the noi&s;e of hounds in a morning, and the riotous mirth of le&s;s rational animals at night. Fortune however at length took pity on her &s;ufferings, and the good '&s;quire overheating him&s;elf at a fox chace, of which a fever was the con&s;e|quence, left her young and rich, at full li|berty to return to the chearful haunts of men, with no very high ideas of matri|monial felicity, and an abhorrence of a country life, which nothing but her friend|&s;hip for Lady Belmont could have one moment &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>A great flow of animal &s;pirits, and a French education, have made her a Coquet, though intended by nature for a much &s;u|perior character. She is elegant in her dre&s;s, equipage, and manner of living, and rather profu&s;e in her expences. I had fir&s;t the honour of knowing her la&s;t winter at Paris, from whence &s;he has been returned
<PB N="14" REF="16">
about &s;ix weeks, three of which &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed at Belmont.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more ea&s;y or agreeable than the manner of living here; it is per|fectly dome&s;tick, yet &s;o diver&s;ifyed with amu&s;ements as to exclude that &s;atiety from which the be&s;t and pure&s;t of &s;ublunary enjoyments are not &s;ecure, if continued in too uniform a cour&s;e: we read, we walk, we ride, we conver&s;e; we play, we dance, we &s;ing; join the company, or indulge in pen&s;ive &s;olitude and meditation, ju&s;t as fancy leads; liberty, re&s;trained alone by virtue and politene&s;s, is the law, and incli|nation the &s;overeign guide, at this man&s;ion of true ho&s;pitality. Free from all the &s;hack|les of idle ceremony, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Lord Belmont's gue&s;ts, and the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction they can give their noble ho&s;t, is to be happy, and to con&s;ult their own ta&s;te entirely in their manner of being &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
Reading, mu&s;ick, riding, and conver&s;a|tion, are Lord Belmont's favourite plea|&s;ures, but none that are innocent are ex|cluded; balls, plays, concerts, cards, bowls, billiards, and parties of plea&s;ure round the neighboring country, relieve each other; and whil&s;t their variety pre|vents any of them from &s;atiating, all con|&s;pire to give a double poignancy to the &s;weeter joys of dome&s;tick life, the calm and tender hours which this charming family devote to the endearing conver&s;a|tion of each other, and of tho&s;e friends particularly honoured with their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e, which is the work of Inigo Jones, is magnificent to the utmo&s;t degree; it &s;tands on the &s;ummit of a &s;lowly ri&s;ing &s;till, facing the South; and beyond a &s;pacious court, has in front an avenue of the talle&s;t trees, which lets in the pro&s;pect of a fruitful valley, bounded at a di&s;tance
<PB N="16" REF="18">
by a mountain, down the &s;ides of which ru&s;hes a foaming ca&s;cade which &s;preads into a thou&s;and meandering &s;treams in the vale below.</P>
<P>The gardens and park, which are behind the hou&s;e, are romantick beyond the wan|tonne&s;s of Imagination; and the whole ad|joining country diver&s;ify'd with hills, valleys, woods, rivers, plains, and every charm of lovely unadorned nature.</P>
<P>Here Lord Belmont enjoys the mo&s;t unmixed and lively of all human plea&s;ures, that of making others happy. His e&s;tate conveys the &s;tronge&s;t idea of the patriarchal government; he &s;eems a beneficent father, &s;urrounded by his children, over whom reverence, gratitude, and love, give him an ab&s;olute authority, which he never exerts but for their good: Every eye &s;hines with tran&s;port at his &s;ight; parents point him
<PB N="17" REF="19">
out to their children; the fir&s;t accents of prattling infancy are taught to li&s;p his ho|noured name; and age, &s;upported by his bounteous hand, pours out the fervent prayer to heaven for its benefactor.</P>
<P>To a life like this, and to an ardent love of independence, Lord Belmont &s;acrifices all the anxious and corroding cares of a|varice and ambition; and finds his account in health, freedom, chearfulne&s;s, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that &s;weet peace which goodne&s;s bo&s;oms ever."</Q> Adieu! I am going with Lord Belmont and my father to Acton-Grange, and &s;hall not return till Thu&s;day.</P>

<P>WE returned ye&s;terday about &s;ix in the evening, and the moment we alighted, my Lord leading us into the
<PB N="18" REF="20">
garden an unexpected &s;cene opened on my view, which recalled the idea of the fabu|lous plea&s;ures of the golden age, and could not but be infinitely plea&s;ing to every mind uncorrupted by the fal&s;e glare of tin&s;el pomp, and awake to the genuine charms of &s;implicity and nature.</P>
<P>On a &s;pacious lawn, bounded on every &s;ide by a profu&s;ion of the mo&s;t odoriferous flowering &s;hrubs, a joyous band of villagers were a&s;&s;embled: the young men dre&s;t in green, youth, health, and plea&s;ure in their air, led up their artle&s;s charmers in &s;traw hats adorned with the &s;poils of Flora, to the ru&s;tick &s;ound of the tabor and pipe; round the lawn, at equal intervals, were rai&s;ed temporary arbors of branches of trees, in which refre&s;hments were prepared for the dancers: and between the arbors, &s;eats of mo&s;s for their parents, &s;haded from the &s;un by green awnings on poles, round
<PB N="19" REF="21">
which were twined wreaths of flowers, breathing the &s;weets of the &s;pring. The &s;urprize, the gaiety of the &s;cene, the flow of general joy, the &s;ight of &s;o many happy people, the countenances of the enraptured parents, who &s;eemed to live over again the &s;prightly &s;ea&s;on of youth in their children, with the benevolent plea&s;ure in the looks of the noble be&s;towers of the fea&s;t, filled my eyes with tears, and my &s;welling heart with a &s;en&s;ation of pure yet lively tran&s;|port, to which the joys of courtly balls are mean.</P>
<P>The ladies, who were &s;itting in conver|&s;ation with &s;ome of the olde&s;t of the villa|gers, ro&s;e at our approach, and my Lord giving Lady Anne Wilmot's hand to my father, and honoring me with Lady Julia's, we mixed in the ru&s;tick ball. The love|lie&s;t of women had an elegant &s;implicity in her air and habit which became the &s;cene,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
and gave her a thou&s;and new charms: &s;he was dre&s;t in a &s;traw-coloured lu&s;tring night gown, the lighte&s;t gauze linen, a hat with purple ribbons, and a &s;prig of glowing purple amaranthus in her bo&s;om: I know not how to convey an idea of the particular &s;tyle of beauty in which &s;he then appeared.&mdash;Youth, health, &s;prightline&s;s and innocence, all &s;truck the imagination at once&mdash;paint to your&s;elf the exqui&s;ite pro|portion, the playful air, and ea&s;y movement of a Venus, with the vivid bloom of an Hebe.&mdash;However high you rai&s;e your ideas, they will fall infinitely &s;hort of the divine original.</P>
<P>The approach of night putting an end to the rural a&s;&s;embly, the villagers retired to the hall, where they continued dancing, and our happy partie pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the evening in that &s;weet and lively conver&s;a|tion which is never to be found but among&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="23">
tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, united by that perfect confidence which makes the mo&s;t trifling &s;ubjects intere&s;ting; none of us thought of &s;eparating, or imagined it midnight, when my father opening a window, the ri&s;ing &s;un broke in upon us, and convinced us on what &s;wift and downy pinions the hours of happine&s;s flit away.</P>

<P>NO, my friend, I have not always been this hero: too &s;en&s;ible to the power of beauty, I have felt the keene&s;t pangs of un&s;ucce&s;sful love: but I de&s;erved to &s;uffer; my pa&s;&s;ion was in the highe&s;t degree criminal, and I blu&s;h, though at this di&s;tance of time, to lay open my heart
<PB N="22" REF="24">
even to the indulgent eyes of partial friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>When your father's death called you back to England, you may remember I continued my journey to Rome: where a letter from my father introduced me into the family of count Mele&s;pini, a nobleman of great wealth and uncommon accom|pli&s;hments: as my father, who has always been of opinion that nothing purifies the heart, refines the ta&s;te, or poli&s;hes the manners, like the conver&s;ation of an amiable, well educated, virtuous woman, had par|tiularly entreated for me the honour of the counte&s;s's friend&s;hip, whom he had known almo&s;t a child, and to whom he had taught the Engli&s;h language; I was admit|ted to the di&s;tinction of partaking in all her amu&s;ements, and attending her every where in the quality of Ceci&s;beo. To the arts of
<PB N="23" REF="25">
the libertine, however fair, my heart had always been &s;teeled; but the counte&s;s joined the mo&s;t piercing wit, the mo&s;t winning politene&s;s, the mo&s;t engaging &s;en&s;i|bility, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delicacy, to a form perfectly lovely. You will not there|fore wonder that the warmth and inexpe|rience of youth, hourly expo&s;ed in &s;o dan|gerous a &s;ituation, was unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch variety of attractions. Charmed with the flattering preference &s;he &s;eemed to give me, my vanity fed by the notice of &s;o accom|pli&s;hed a creature, forgetting tho&s;e &s;en|timents of honour which ought never to be one moment &s;u&s;pended, I became pa&s;|&s;ionately in love with this charming wo|man: for &s;ome months I &s;truggled with my love, till on her ob&s;erving that my health &s;eemed impared, and I had lo&s;t my u&s;ual vivacity, I took courage to confe&s;s the cau&s;e, though in terms which &s;uffici|ently &s;poke my de&s;pair of touching a heart which I feared was too &s;en&s;ible to virtue
<PB N="24" REF="26">
for my happine&s;s: I implored her pity, and prote&s;ted I had no hope of in&s;piring a tenderer &s;entiment Whil&s;t I was &s;peaking, which was in broken interrupted &s;entences, the counte&s;s looked at me with the &s;trong|e&s;t &s;orrow and compa&s;&s;ion painted in her eyes; &s;he was for &s;ome moments &s;ilent, and &s;eemed lo&s;t in thought; but at la&s;t, with an air of dignifyed &s;weetne&s;s, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear Enrico,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hall I own to you that I have for &s;ome time feared this confe&s;&s;ion?

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Mordaunt, to expre&s;s to you the &s;hame this di&s;cour&s;e filled me with: her gentle, her affection|ate reproofs, the generous concern &s;he &s;howed for my error, the mild dignity of her a&s;pect, plunged me into inexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion, and &s;hewd my fault in it's

<P>The count, who&s;e own probity and virtue &s;et him far above &s;u&s;pecting mine, pre&s;&s;ed me with all the earne&s;tne&s;s of a friend&s;hip I &s;o little merited, to defer my journey a week: on which I rai&s;ed my downca&s;t eyes to madam Mele&s;pini; for &s;uch influence had this lovely woman over my heart, I did not dare to con&s;ent till certain of her permi&s;&s;ion; and reading approbation in a &s;mile of conde&s;cending &s;weetne&s;s, I con|&s;ented with a tran&s;port which only tho&s;e who have loved like me can conceive: my chearfulne&s;s returning, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t amiable people in Rome coming in, we pa&s;t the evening in the utmo&s;t gaiety. At taking leave I was engaged to the &s;ame company in dif|ferent parties of amu&s;ement for the whole time I had to &s;tay, and had the joy of being every day with the counte&s;s,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
though I never found an opportunity of &s;peaking to her without witne&s;&s;es, till the evening before I left Rome, when going to her hou&s;e an hour &s;ooner than I was expected, I found her alone in her clo&s;et: when I approached her, my voice faltered, I trembled, I wanted power to addre&s;s her; and this moment, &s;ought with &s;uch care, wi&s;hed with &s;uch ardor, was the mo&s;t painful of my life. Shame alone prevented my retiring; my eyes were involuntarily turned towards the door at which I entered, in a vain hope of that interruption I had before dreaded as the greate&s;t misfortune; and even the pre&s;ence of my happy envied rival would at that moment have been mo&s;t welcome.</P>

<P>I took the pictures eagerly, and ki&s;&s;ed that of the Counte&s;s with a pa&s;&s;ion I could

not re&s;train, of which however &s;he took not the lea&s;t notice. I thanked her, with a confu&s;ed air, for &s;o invaluable a pre&s;ent; and intreated her to pity a friend&s;hip too tender for my peace, but as re&s;pectful and as pure as &s;he her&s;elf could wi&s;h it.</P>
<P>The abbate Camilli here joined us, and once more &s;aved me a &s;cene too intere&s;ting for the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of my heart: the Count entered the room &s;oon after, and our conver&s;ation turned on the other cities of Italy, which I intended vi&s;iting; to mo&s;t of which he gave me letters of recommen|dation to the noble&s;t families, wrote in terms &s;o polite and affectionate as &s;tabbed me to the heart with a &s;en&s;e of my own ingratitude: he did me the honor to ac|cept my picture, which I had not the cou|rage to offer the Counte&s;s. After protract|ing till morning a parting &s;o exqui&s;itely painful, I tore my&s;elf from all I loved, and bathing with tears her hand which I pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="34" REF="36">
eagerly to my lips, threw my&s;elf into my chai&s;e, and, without going to bed, took the road to Naples. But how difficult was this conque&s;t! How often was I tempted to return to Rome, and throw my&s;elf at the Counte&s;s's feet, without con&s;idering the con&s;equences of &s;o wild an action. You, my deare&s;t Mordaunt, who&s;e di&s;cerning &s;pirit knows all the windings, the &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tencies of the human heart, will pity rather than blame your friend, when he owns there were mo|ments in which he formed the infamous re&s;olution of carrying her off by force.</P>
<P>But when the mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion a little di&s;|per&s;ed, I began to entertain more worthy &s;entiments; I determined to drive this lovely woman from my heart, and conquer an inclination, which the Count's generous un&s;u&s;pecting friend&s;hip would have made criminal even in the eyes of the mo&s;t aban|doned libertine; rather owing this re&s;olution
<PB N="35" REF="37">
however to an ab&s;olute de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s then either to rea&s;on or a &s;en&s;e of honor, my cure was a work of time. I was &s;o weak during &s;ome months as to confine my vi&s;its to the families where the Count's letters introduced me, that I might indulge my pa&s;&s;ion by hearing the lovely Counte&s;s continually mentioned.</P>
<P>Convinced at length of the folly of thus feeding &s;o hopele&s;s a flame, I re&s;olved to a|void every place where I had a chance of hearing that adored name: I left Italy for France, where I hoped a life of di&s;&s;ipation would drive her for ever from my remem|brance. I even profaned my pa&s;&s;ion for her by meeting the advances of a Coquette, but di&s;gu&s;t &s;ucceeded my conque&s;t, and I found it was from time alone I mu&s;t hope a cure: I had been near a year at Paris, when in April la&s;t, I received a letter from my fa|ther, who pre&s;&s;ed my return, and appointed me to meet him immediately at the Hague,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
from whence we returned together; and after a few days &s;tay in London, came down to Belmont, where the charms of Lady Julia's conver&s;ation, and the e&s;teem &s;he honors me with, entirely compleated my cure, which, time ab&s;ence, and the Count's tender and affectionate letters, had very far advanced. There is a &s;weetne&s;s in her friend&s;hip, my dear Mordaunt, to which love it&s;elf mu&s;t yield the palm; the delicacy, yet vivacity of her &s;entiments, the &s;oft &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, which without fear li&s;tens to vows of eternal amity and e&s;teem.&mdash;O Mordaunt, I mu&s;t not, I do not hope for, I do not indeed wi&s;h for, her love; but can it be po&s;&s;ible there is a man on earth to whom heaven de&s;tines &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing!</P>

literally governed his conduct by the old adage that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Learning is better than hou&s;e and land;"</Q> for as his &s;on's learning advanced, his hou&s;es and lands melted away, or at lea&s;t would have done, had it not been for his mother's fortune, every &s;hilling of which, with half the profits of his e&s;tate, he expended on Harry's educa|tion; who certainly wants only ten thou|&s;and pounds a year to be the mo&s;t charm|ing young fellow in the univer&s;e.

<P>You mu&s;t know then, (a pretty phra&s;e that, but to proceed) you mu&s;t know, that we accompanied Col. Mandeville fif|teen miles, and after dining together at an inn, he took the road to his regiment,

<P>IT is the cu&s;tom here for every body to &s;pend their mornings as they plea&s;e, which does not however hinder our &s;ome times making parties all together when our inclinations happen all to take the &s;ame turn. My lord this morning pro|po&s;ed an airing to the ladies, and that we &s;hould, in&s;tead of returning to dinner, &s;top at the fir&s;t neat farm hou&s;e where we could hope for decent accommodations. Love of variety made the propo&s;al agreea|ble to us all; and a &s;ervant being ordered
<PB N="47" REF="49">
before to make &s;ome little provi&s;ion, we &s;topped, after the plea&s;ante&s;t airing ima|ginable, at the entrance of a wood, where leaving our equipages to be &s;ent to the neighbouring village, we walked up a winding path to a ru&s;tic building, em|bo&s;omed in the grove, the architecture of which was in the mo&s;t elegant &s;tile of &s;im|plicity: the trees around this lovely re|treat were covered with wood-bines and je&s;&s;amines, from which a gale of perfume met our approach: the gentle&s;t breath of Zephyr ju&s;t moved the leaves, the birds &s;ung in the branches, a &s;pring of the cleare&s;t water broke from the ri&s;ing ground on the left, and murmuring along a tran&s;|parent pebbly bottom, &s;eemed to lo&s;e it|&s;elf in a thicket of ro&s;es: no rude &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;weet harmony of nature; all breathed the &s;oul of innocence and tran|quillity, but a tranquillity rai&s;ed above it&s;elf. My heart danced with plea&s;ure, and the lovely lady Julia happening to be next
<PB N="48" REF="50">
me, I ki&s;&s;ed her hand with an involuntary fer|vor, which called up into her cheeks a blu&s;h <Q REND="inline">"cele&s;tial ro&s;y red."</Q> When we entered the hou&s;e, we were &s;truck with the propriety, the beauty, the &s;implicity of all around us; the apartments were few, but airy and commodious; the furniture plain, but new and in the mo&s;t beautiful ta&s;te; no ornaments but va&s;es of flowers, no at|tendants but country girls, blooming as the morn, and dre&s;t with a neatne&s;s inex|pre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>After an elegant cold dinner, and a de|&s;ert of cream and the be&s;t fruits in &s;ea&s;on, we walked into the wood with which the hou&s;e was &s;urrounded, the romantic var|riety of which it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; all was nature, but nature in her mo&s;t plea|&s;ing form: We wandered over the &s;weet|ly varyed &s;cene, re&s;ting at intervals in ar|bours of intermingled ro&s;es and je&s;&s;amines, till we reached a beautiful mo&s;&s;y grotto,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
wildly lovely, who&s;e entrance was almo&s;t hid by the vines which &s;launted over its top. Here we found tea and coffee pre|pared as if by invi&s;ible hands; Lady Anne exclaimed that all was enchantment, and Lord Belmont's eyes &s;parkled with that lively joy, which a benevolent mind feels in communicating happine&s;s to others.</P>
<P>Lady Julia alone &s;eemed not to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of the day: Her charming eyes had a melancholy langour I never &s;aw in them before; &s;he was re&s;erved, &s;ilent, ab&s;ent, and would not have e&s;caped Lady Anne's raillery, had not the latter been too much taken up with the lovely &s;cene to attend to any thing but joy.</P>
<P>As friend&s;hip has a thou&s;and groundle&s;s fears, I tremble le&s;t I &s;hould have been &s;o unhappy as to offend her: I remember &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed with my ki&s;&s;ing her

hand, and &s;carce &s;poke to me the whole day: I will beg of Lady Anne to a&s;k the cau&s;e, for I cannot &s;upport the apprehen|&s;ion of having offended her.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty Lord Belmont forced us at night from this enchanting re|tirement, which he calls his hermitage, and which is the &s;cene of his mo&s;t plea&s;ing hours. To Lady Anne and me it had a charm it did not want, the powerful charm of novelty: it is about four miles from Belmont hou&s;e, not far di&s;tant from the extremities of the park. To this place I am told Lord Belmont often retires with his amiable family, and tho&s;e particularly happy in his e&s;teem, to avoid the hurry of company, and give him&s;elf up entirely to the uninterrupted &s;weets of dome&s;tic enjoyment. Sure no man but Lord Bel|mont knows how to live!</P>

<P>YES, my dear &s;on, you do me ju&s;tice: I am never &s;o happy as when I know you are &s;o. I perfectly agree with you as to the charms of Lord Belmont's hermit|age, and admire that genuine ta&s;te for ele|gant nature which gives &s;uch a &s;pirited variety to the life of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of men.</P>
<P>But does it not, my dear Harry, give you at the &s;ame time a very contemptible
<PB N="54" REF="56">
idea of the power of greatne&s;s to make its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors happy, to &s;ee it thus flying as it were from it&s;elf, and &s;eeking plea&s;ure not in the fruition, but in the temporary &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion, of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed advantages it has above other conditions of life? Believe me it is not in the co&s;tly dome, but in the rural cott, that the impartial Lord of all has fixed the chearful &s;eat of happine&s;s. Health, peace, content, and &s;oft dome&s;tic tenderne&s;s, the only real &s;weets of life, driven from the gilded palace, &s;mile on the humble roof of virtuous indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The poor complain not of the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of life: their daily toil makes &s;hort the flying hours, and every moment of re&s;t from labor is to them a moment of enjoyment. Not &s;o the great: Surrounded from earlie&s;t youth by plea&s;ures which court their acceptance, their ta&s;te palled by habit, and the too great facility of &s;atia|ting every wi&s;h, la&s;&s;itude and di&s;gu&s;t creep
<PB N="55" REF="57">
on their languid hours; and wanting the doubtful gale of hope to keep the mind in gentle agitation, it &s;inks into a dead calm more de&s;tructive to every enjoyment than the rude&s;t &s;torm of adver&s;ity. The haughty Dutche&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ed with ta&s;tele&s;s pomp, and &s;inking under the weight of her own importance, is much le&s;s to be envyed than <Q REND="inline">"the milk-maid &s;inging blithe,"</Q> who is in her eyes the object only of pity and contempt.</P>
<P>Your acquaintance with the great world, my dear Harry, has &s;hown you the &s;plendid mi&s;ery of &s;uperior life: you have &s;een tho&s;e mo&s;t wretched to whom heaven has granted the ample&s;t external means of happine&s;s. Mi&s;erable &s;laves to pride, the mo&s;t corroding of human pa&s;&s;ions, &s;trang|ers to &s;ocial plea&s;ure, incapable of love or friend&s;hip, living to others not to them|&s;elves, ever in pur&s;uit of the &s;hadow of happine&s;s, whil&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance glides
<PB N="56" REF="58">
pa&s;t them unob&s;erved, they drag on an in&s;ipid joyle&s;s being: unloved and un|connected, &s;corning the tender ties which give life all its &s;weetne&s;s, they &s;ink unwept and unlamented to the grave. They know not the conver&s;ation of a friend, that con|ver&s;ation which <Q REND="inline">"brightens the eyes:"</Q> their pride, an inva&s;ion on the natural rights of mankind, meets with perpetual mortification; and their rage for di&s;&s;ipa|tion, like the burning thir&s;t of a fever, is at once boundle&s;s and unquenchable.</P>
<P>Yet tho' happine&s;s loves the vale, it would be unju&s;t to confine her to tho&s;e humble &s;cenes; nor is her pre&s;ence, as our times afford a &s;hining and amiable example, unattainable to royalty it&s;elf: the wi&s;e and good, whate'er their rank, led by the hand of &s;imple unerring nature, are &s;el|dom known to mi&s;s their way to her de|lightful abode.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
You have &s;een Lord Belmont (ble&s;t with wi&s;dom to chu&s;e, and fortune to pur|&s;ue his choice, convinced that wealth and titles, the portion of few, are not only foreign to, but often incon&s;i&s;tent with, true happine&s;s) &s;eek the lovely godde&s;s, not in the pride of &s;how, the pomp of courts, or the madne&s;s of di&s;&s;ipation; but in the calm of retirement, in the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip, in the &s;weets of dear dome&s;|tick life, in the tender plea&s;ing duties of hu&s;band and of father, in the practice of beneficence, and every gentler virtue. Others may be like him convinced, but few like him have &s;pirit and re&s;olution to bur&s;t the magic fetters of example and fa&s;hion, and nobly dare to be happy.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure does it give me to find you in &s;o ju&s;t a way of thinking in regard to fortune! Yes, my dear Harry, all that in reality de&s;erves the name of good, &s;o far as it centers in our&s;elves, is within
<PB N="58" REF="60">
the reach, not only of our moderate in|come, but of one much below it. Great wealth is only de&s;irable for the power it gives us of making others happy, and when one &s;ees how very few make this only laudable u&s;e of extreme affluence, one acquie&s;ces chearfully in the will of heaven, &s;atisfied with not having the temptation of mi&s;applying tho&s;e gifts of the &s;upreme being, for which we &s;hall un|doubtedly be accountable.</P>
<P>Nothing can, as you ob&s;erve, be more worthy a rea&s;onable creature than Lord Belmont's plan of life: he has enlarged his own circle of happine&s;s, by taking into it that of all mankind, and parti|cularly of all around him: his bounty glides unob&s;erved, like the deep &s;ilent &s;tream, nor is it by relieving &s;o much as by preventing want, that his generous &s;pirit acts: its his glory and his plea&s;ure
<PB N="59" REF="61">
that he mu&s;t go beyond the limits of his own e&s;tate to find objects of real di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He encourages indu&s;try, and keeps up the &s;oul of chearfulne&s;s among&s;t his ten|ants, by maintaining as much as po&s;&s;ible the natural equality of mankind on his e&s;tate: His farms are not large, but moderately rented; all are at ea&s;e, and can provide happily for their families, none ri&s;e to ex|orbitant wealth. The very cottagers are &s;trangers to all that even approaches want: when the bu&s;ier &s;ea&s;ons of the year are pa&s;t, he gives them employment in his woods or gardens; and finds double beauties in every improvement there, when he reflects that from thence
<Q><L>" Health to him&s;elf and to his infants bread,</L>
<L>" The labourer bears." &mdash;</L></Q>
Plenty, the child of indu&s;try, &s;miles on their humble abodes, and if any un|fore&s;een
<PB N="60" REF="62">
misfortune nips the blo&s;&s;oms of their pro&s;perity, his bounty, de&s;cending &s;ilent and refre&s;hing as the dews of hea|ven, renews their blooming &s;tate, and re&s;tores joy to their happy dwellings.</P>
<P>To &s;ay all in one word, the maxims by which he governs all the actions of his life are manly, benevolent, enlarged, liberal; and his generous pa&s;&s;ion for the good of others is rewarded by his creator, who&s;e approbation is his fir&s;t point of view, with as much happine&s;s to him|&s;elf as this &s;ublunary &s;tate is capable of.

The great gates being thrown open, and the chariot drawn up to the &s;teps, my charming Fondville, dre&s;t in a &s;uit of light|colored &s;ilk embroidered with &s;ilver, a hat with a black feather under his arm, and a large bouquet of artificial flowers in his button-hole, all Arabia breathing from his well &s;cented handkerchief, de&s;cend|ed, like Adonis from the carr of Venus, and full of the idea of his own irre&s;i&s;tibility, advanced towards the &s;aloon&mdash;he advanced not with the doubtful air of a ba&s;hful lover intimidated by a thou&s;and tender fears, but in a minuet &s;tep, humming an opera tune, and ca&s;ting a &s;ide glance at every looking gla&s;s in his way.

<P>When I fir&s;t came to Belmont, having been &s;ome years abroad, I found my te|nants poor and dejected, &s;carce able to gain a hard penurious living. The neigh|bouring gentlemen &s;pending two thirds of

I promoted every kind of diver&s;ion, which &s;oon filled my town with gentlemen's fa|milies, which rai&s;ed the markets, and of con&s;equence the value of my e&s;tate: my tenants grew rich at the &s;ame rents which before they were unable to pay, population encrea&s;ed, my villages were full of inha|bitants, and all around me was gay and flouri&s;hing; &s;o &s;imple, my dear Mr. Man|deville are the maxims of true policy: but it mu&s;t be &s;o; that machine which has the fewe&s;t wheels is certainly mo&s;t ea&s;y to keep in order.</P>

<HEAD>TO HENRY MANDEVILLE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 22d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent member of parliament for &mdash; being in a &s;tate of health which renders his life extremely uncertain, it would be very agreable to me if my dear Mr. Mandeville would think of offering him&s;elf a candidate to &s;ucceed him. I will however be &s;o plain as to tell him, he will have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me except my wi&s;hes, and has nothing to tru&s;t to but his merits and the name of Mandeville;
<PB N="96" REF="98">
it being a point both of con&s;cience and honor with me, never to intermeddle in elections. The pre&s;ervation of our happy con&s;titution depends on the perfect inde|pendence of each part of which it is com|po&s;ed on the other two: and the moment, heaven grant that moment to be far di&s;|tant! when the hou&s;e of lords can make a hou&s;e of commons, liberty and prero|gative will cea&s;e to be more than names, and both prince and people become&s;laves.</P>
<P>I therefore always, tho' the whole town is mine, leave the people to their free and uninfluenced choice: never interfering farther than to in&s;i&s;t on their keeping them&s;elves as unbya&s;&s;ed as I leave them. I would not only withdraw my favor from, but pro&s;ecute, the man who was ba&s;e enough to take a bribe, tho' he who of|fered it was my neare&s;t friend.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
By this means I have the plea&s;ure al&s;o of keeping my&s;elf free, and at liberty to confer favors where I plea&s;e; &s;o that I &s;e|cure my own independence by not invad|ing that of others.</P>
<P>This conduct, I cannot help thinking, if general, would pre&s;erve the ballance of our glorious con&s;titution; a ballance of much greater con&s;equence to Britons than the ballance of power in Europe, tho' &s;o much le&s;s the object of their attention. In this we re&s;emble tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, whil&s;t they are bu&s;ied in regulating the do|me&s;tic concerns of their neighbours, &s;uf|fer their own to be ruined.</P>
<P>But to return from this unintended digre&s;&s;ion: You will perhaps object to what I have propo&s;ed, that during your father's life you are not qualified for a &s;eat in parliament. I have obviated this ob|jection. Lady Mary, the only &s;i&s;ter of
<PB N="98" REF="100">
my father, has an ample fortune in her own power to di&s;po&s;e of: &s;ome part of it was originally her own, but much the larger part was left her by her lover, Sir Charles Barton, who was killed in queen Anne's wars, the very morning before he was to have &s;et out for England to complete his marriage. Being the la&s;t of his family, he had made a will, in which he left his e&s;tate to lady Mary, with a reque&s;t, that, if &s;he did not marry, &s;he would leave it to one of the name of Mandeville. As &s;he loves merit, and has the happine&s;s and honor of our hou&s;e warmly at heart, I have ea&s;ily prevailed on her to &s;ettle 500<HI>l.</HI> a year on you at pre&s;ent, and to leave you a good part of the re&s;t at her death. Her de&s;ign hitherto, I will not conceal from you, has been to leave her fortune to my daughter, of whom &s;he is infinitely fond; but Julia has enough, and by leaving it to you, &s;he more exactly fullfils the will of Sir Charles, who, tho' he has not expre&s;sly made the
<PB N="99" REF="101">
di&s;tinction, certainly meant it to a male of the Mandeville name. The e&s;tate is about 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year; her own fortune of 14000<HI>l.</HI> I &s;hall not oppo&s;e her leaving to my daughter.</P>
<P>I know too well the generous &s;entiments of your heart to doubt that, in procuring this &s;ettlement, I give to my country a firm and un&s;haken patriot, at once above de|pendance on the mo&s;t virtuous court, and the mean vanity of oppo&s;ing the ju&s;t mea|&s;ures of his prince, from a too eager de|&s;ire of popularity: not that I would have you in&s;en&s;ible to prai&s;e, or the e&s;teem of your country; but &s;eek it only by de&s;erv|ing it, and tho' it be in part the reward, let it not be the motive of your actions: let your own approbation be your fir&s;t view, and that of others only your &s;econd.</P>
<P>You may ob&s;erve, my dear Mr. Mande|ville, I only caution you again&s;t being led
<PB N="100" REF="102">
away by youthful vanity to oppo&s;e the ju&s;t mea&s;ures of your prince: I &s;hould wrong the integrity of your heart, if I &s;uppo&s;ed you capable of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the hands of go|vernment for mercenary or ambitious pur|po&s;es: a virtuous &s;enator will regard, not men, but mea&s;ures, and will concur with his bittere&s;t enemies in every &s;alutary and hone&s;t purpo&s;e; or rather, in a public light, he will have no enemies, but the enemies of his country.</P>
<P>It is with caution I give even the&s;e ge|neral hints; far be it from me to attempt to influence your judgment: let your opi|nion be ever free and your own; or where your inexperience may want information, &s;eek it from the be&s;t, and mo&s;t enlighten'd of mankind, your excellent father, who has long &s;at with honor in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Let me now, my amiable friend, thank you for your obliging attention, not only
<PB N="101" REF="103">
to the ladies, of whom I could not doubt your care, but of my tenants, one of whom writes me word, that coming to enquire when I &s;hould return, with a look of anx|iety which &s;hew'd my return was of con|&s;equence to him, you took him a&s;ide, and enquiring his bu&s;ine&s;s, found he wanted, from an accident which had involved him in a temporary di&s;tre&s;s, to borrow 100<HI>l.</HI> for which you gave him a draught on your banker, with a goodne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of manner, which doubled the obligation; making only one condition, which the over|flowing of his gratitude has made him un|able to keep, that it &s;hould be a &s;ecret to all the world.</P>
<P>Can Lady Mary do too much for a man who thus &s;hews him&s;elf worthy the name of Mandeville, the characteri&s;tick of which has ever been the warme&s;t benevolence?</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">
Another would, perhaps, in&s;i&s;t on re|turning the money to you, but I will not rob you of the plea&s;ure of making an ho|ne&s;t man happy: you will however ob|&s;erve, that it is this once only I indulge you; and that you are the only per&s;on from whom I have ever &s;uffered my fami|ly, for &s;uch I e&s;teem all placed by Provi|dence under my protection, to receive an obligation: 'tis is a favor I have refu&s;ed even to your father.</P>

<P>OUR party la&s;t night did not turn out &s;o much in the &s;till-life way as I ex|pected&mdash;unfortunate that I am&mdash;two rivals at once&mdash;la Belli&s;&s;ima Julia has mo&s;t cer|tainly a penchant for Harry&mdash;'tis ab&s;urd, for the thing is impo&s;&s;ible: in the fir&s;t place I am rather afraid he has a kind of attachment to this creature, and in the &s;e|cond, I know Lord Belmont's &s;entiments on this head, and that with all his genero|&s;ity, no man breathing has a greater aver|&s;ion to unequal marriages: the difference is &s;o immen&s;e in every thing but birth and merit, that there remains not a &s;hadow of hope for her. But the&s;e people of high
<PB N="105" REF="107">
heroics are above attending to &s;uch trifling things as po&s;&s;ibilities&mdash;I hope I am mi&s;ta|ken, but the &s;ymptoms are &s;trong upon her, as you &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>I left you la&s;t night to accompany Lady Julia to the wood we are both &s;o fond of: the evening was lovely beyond de&s;cription, and we were engaged in a very lively con|ver&s;ation, when, as we approached the temple, we &s;aw Harry, who had ju&s;t left us on pretence of writing letters, come out of it with the dete&s;table We&s;tbrook lean|ing familiarly on his arm, her pert eyes &s;oftened into langui&s;hment, and fixed eager|ly on his: the forward creature &s;tarted at &s;eeing us, and attempted to fly, which Harry prevented, and withdrawing his arm from hers, as if mechanically, advanc'd &s;lowly towards us, with a look &s;o confus'd, a mien &s;o di&s;order'd, &s;o different from that ea&s;y air which gives ten thou&s;and graces to the fine&s;t form in the world, as convinced me
<PB N="106" REF="108">
that this meeting was not accidental. Lady Julia &s;top'd the moment &s;he &s;aw them, a deep blu&s;h over&s;pread her face, &s;he fixed her eyes on the ground, and waited their ap|proach &s;ilent and unmov'd as a &s;tatue. Not &s;o the cit! the creature's a&s;&s;urance, and the ea&s;e with which &s;he recover'd her&s;elf and ad|dre&s;&s;ed Lady Julia, excited equally my a|&s;toni&s;hment and indignation. She told her &s;he came to wait on her Lady&s;hip, and the finene&s;s of the evening had tempted her to leave her coach at the entrance of the wood: that as &s;he walked thro' &s;he happen'd to meet Mr. Mandeville, quite by chance &s;he a&s;&s;ured her Lady&s;hip; as he would te&s;tify. Harry di&s;dain'd to confirm her fal&s;hood even by an a&s;&s;enting look: his &s;ilence, the cold|ne&s;s of his manner, with the air of dignity and &s;pirit Lady Julia a&s;&s;umed, almo&s;t di&s;con|certed her; we walk'd &s;ilently to the hou&s;e, where the girl only &s;tay'd till her coach was order'd round, and then left us; her eyes
<PB N="107" REF="109">
a&s;k'd Harry's attendance, but he cho&s;e not to under&s;tand their language.</P>
<P>This evening was the only unplea&s;ant one I ever pa&s;t at Belmont: a re&s;erve un|known before in that &s;eat of &s;incere friend|&s;hip, took place of the &s;weet confidence which u&s;ed to reign there, and to which it owes its mo&s;t &s;triking charms: we retired earlier than u&s;ual, and lady Julia, in&s;tead of &s;pending half an hour in my apart|ment, as u&s;ual, took leave of me at the door and pa&s;&s;ed on to her own.</P>
<P>I am extremely alarmed for her&mdash;it would have been natural to have talk'd over &s;o extraordinary an adventure with me, if not too nearly intere&s;ted&mdash;There was a con&s;traint in her behaviour to Harry all the evening&mdash;an a&s;&s;um'd coldne&s;s&mdash;his a&s;&s;i|duity &s;eem'd to di&s;plea&s;e her&mdash;&s;he &s;igh'd often&mdash;nay once when my eyes met hers I ob&s;erved a tear ready to &s;tart&mdash;&s;he may

call this friend&s;hip if &s;he plea&s;es, but the&s;e very tender, the&s;e apprehen&s;ive, the&s;e jea|lous friend&s;hips, between amiable young people of different &s;exes are exceedingly &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>It is an hour later than her u&s;ual time of appearing, and I hear nothing of her: I am determined not to indulge this tender melancholy, and have &s;ent up to let her know I attend her in the &s;aloon, for I often breakfa&s;t in my own apartment, it being the way here for every body to do what|ever they like.&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed! a letter from Lady Julia!&mdash;a vindication?&mdash;nay then&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"guilty upon my honor."</Q>&mdash;Why imagine I &s;u&s;pect her?&mdash;O! Con&s;cience!</P>
<P>Her extreme fear of my &s;uppo&s;ing her in love with Harry, is a convincing proof that &s;he is, tho' &s;uch is her amiable &s;ince|rity,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
that I am &s;ure &s;he &s;has deceived her|&s;elf before &s;he would attempt to deceive me; but the latter is not &s;o ea&s;y; &s;itters by &s;ee all the game.</P>
<P>She tells me, &s;he cannot &s;ee me till &s;he has vindicated her&s;elf from a &s;u&s;picion which the weakne&s;s of her behaviour ye&s;|terday may have cau&s;ed: That &s;he is not &s;ure &s;he has re&s;olution to mention the &s;ub|ject when pre&s;ent; therefore takes this way to a&s;&s;ure me, that tender and lively as her friend&s;hip for Mr. Mandeville is, it is only friend&s;hip; a friend&s;hip which his merit has hitherto ju&s;tified, and which has been the innocent plea&s;ure of her life: That born with too keen &s;en&s;ibilities (poor thing! I pity her &s;en&s;ibilities) the ill treat|ment of her friends wounds her to the &s;oul. That zeal for his honor and the integrity of his character, which &s;he thinks injured by the my&s;terious air of la&s;t night's

<P>In &s;hort, &s;he takes a great deal of pains to lead her&s;elf into an error; and &s;truggles in tho&s;e toils which &s;he will find great dif|ficulty in breaking.</P>
<P>Harry's valet has ju&s;t told my woman his ma&s;ter was in bed but two hours la&s;t night: that he walked about his room till three, and ro&s;e again at five, and went out on hor&s;eback, without a &s;ervant. The poor fellow is frighted to death about him, for he is idolized by his &s;ervants,

<P>Poor &s;oul! I never &s;aw any thing like her confu&s;ion when we met: &s;he blu&s;hed, &s;he trembled, and &s;unk half motionle&s;s into her chair: I made the tea, without taking the lea&s;t notice of her inability to do it; and by my ea&s;y chit chat manner &s;oon brought her to be a little compo&s;ed: though her eye was often turned towards the door, though &s;he &s;tarted at every &s;ound, yet &s;he never a&s;ked the cau&s;e of Harry's ab&s;ence, which mu&s;t however &s;ur|prize her, as he always breakfa&s;ts below.</P>

<P>I Have reconciled the friends: the &s;cene was amazingly pathetic and pretty: I am only &s;orry I am too lazy to de&s;cribe it. He ki&s;&s;ed her hand, without her &s;howing the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of anger; &s;he blu&s;hed indeed, but, if I under&s;tand blu&s;hes&mdash;in &s;hort, times are prodigiou&s;ly changed.</P>
<P>The &s;trange mi&s;&s;es were of infinite u&s;e, as they broke the continuity of the tender &s;cene (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) which however entertaining to Les Amies, would have been &s;omething &s;ickly to my Lady&s;hip, if it had la&s;ted.</P>
<P>And now having united, it mu&s;t be my next work to divide them; for &s;eriou&s;ly I am apt to believe, the dear creatures are

in immen&s;e danger of a kind of Penchant for each other, which would not be quite &s;o convenient.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome thoughts, being naturally &s;entimental and generous, of taking Harry my&s;elf, meerly from compa&s;&s;ion to Lady Julia. Widows, you know, are in &s;ome degree the property of hand&s;ome young fellows, who have more merit than for|tune; and there would be &s;omething very heroic in devoting my&s;elf to &s;ave my friend. I always told you, Bellville, I was more an antique Roman than a Briton. But I mu&s;t leave you: I hear Lady Julia coming to fetch me: we breakfa&s;t a Trio in a bower of ro&s;es.</P>
<P>O heavens! the plot begins to thicken&mdash;Lucretia's dagger-Ro&s;amonda's bowl&mdash;Harry has had a letter from his charmer&mdash;vows &s;he can't live without him&mdash;deter|mined to die unle&s;s the barbarous man re|lents.&mdash;This

cruel Harry will be the death of us all.</P>
<P>Did I tell you we were going to a ball to-night, &s;ix or &s;even miles off? She has heard it, and intends to be there: tells him &s;he &s;hall there expect the &s;entence of life or death from his lovely eyes: the &s;ignal is appointed: if his &s;avage heart is melted, and he pities her &s;ufferings, he is to dance with her, and be ma&s;ter of her divine per&s;on and eighty thou&s;and pounds, to-morrow; if not&mdash;but &s;he expires at the idea&mdash;&s;he entreats him to &s;often the cruel &s;troke, and not give a mortal wound to the tendere&s;t of hearts by danc|ing with another.</P>
<P>You would die to &s;ee Harry's di&s;tre&s;s,&mdash;&s;o anxious for the tender creature's life, &s;o incen&s;ed at his own wicked attractions, &s;o per|plext how to pronounce the fatal &s;entence&mdash;for my part I have had the utmo&s;t difficulty

<P>The whole &s;cene is too ridiculous to be conceived, and too fooli&s;h even to laugh at: I could &s;tand it no longer, &s;o retired, and left them to their &s;oft &s;orrows.</P>
<P>You may talk of women, but you men are as much the dupes of your own vani|ty as the weake&s;t among&s;t us can be. Heaven and earth! that with Harry's under&s;tanding and knowledge of the world, he can be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed at &s;uch a let|ter.

was no other lover to be had indeed,&mdash;but he is led a&s;tray by the dear &s;elf-complea|cency of contemplating the &s;urprizing effects of his own charms.</P>
<P>I &s;ee he is &s;hocked at my in&s;en&s;ibility, and fancies I have a mo&s;t unfeeling heart, but I may live to have my revenge. Adio! I am going to my toilet. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now awful beauty puts on all its arms."</Q></P>

<P>WE are again at Belmont. But Oh, how changed! all our he|roicks de&s;troyed&mdash;poor Harry, I can't look at him without laughing.</P>
<P>Our journey thither was pen&s;ive, our conver&s;ation &s;entimental; we entered the ball room trembling with apprehen&s;ion, where the fir&s;t object which &s;truck our eyes, was the tender, love&s;ick, dying maid, li&s;tening with the mo&s;t eager attention to Fondville, who was at the very moment ki&s;&s;ing her hand; her whole &s;oul in her eyes, her heart fiuttering with a plea&s;ure which &s;he could not conceal, and every feature on the full &s;tretch of coquetry.</P>
<P>An involuntary frown clouded the lovely countenance of my Harry, which was not
<PB N="123" REF="125">
le&s;&s;ened by his ob&s;erving a malicious &s;mile on mine: he advanced however towards her, when &s;he, not doubting his de&s;ign was to a&s;k her to dance, told him, in a faltering voice, with a mixed air of triumph and irre&s;olution, her eyes fixed on her &s;on, that &s;he was engaged to Lord Fond|ville.</P>
<P>Harry was thunder&s;truck: a glow of indignation flu&s;hed his cheek, and he left her without deigning to make her any re|ply; which I ob&s;erving, and fearing &s;he might mi&s;interpret his &s;ilence, and that the idea of his &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;appointment might flatter the creature's vanity, took care to explain to her that he was engaged to Lady Julia before we came; a piece of information which made her feel to the quick, even through the plea&s;ure of danc|ing with a Lord; a plea&s;ure which has in|conceivable charms for a citizen's daughter, and which love it&s;elf, or what &s;he plea&s;es
<PB N="124" REF="126">
to call love, could not enable her to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The attention of all the company was now turned on Harry, and Lady Julia, who were dancing a minuet: the beauty of their per&s;ons, the ea&s;y dignity of their air, the vivid bloom of their cheeks, the &s;pirit which &s;hone in their eyes, the inimitable graces of their movement, which received a thou&s;and additional charms, (from what I hope no one ob&s;erved but my&s;elf,) their de&s;ire of plea&s;ing each other, gave me an idea of perfection in dancing which never before entered my imagination: all was &s;till as night; not a voice, not a mo|tion, through the whole a&s;&s;embly. The &s;pectators &s;eemed afraid even to breathe, le&s;t their attention &s;hould be one moment &s;u&s;pended: Envy her&s;elf &s;eemed dead, or to confine her influence to the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s We&s;tbrook. The minuet ended, a murmur of applau&s;e ran through the room,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
which, by calling up her blu&s;hes, gave a thou&s;and new charms to Lady Julia, which I ob&s;erved to the cit, adding al&s;o aloud that it was impo&s;&s;ible any body &s;hould think of dancing minuets after them; in which &s;entiment every body concurring, we began country dances. Harry never looked &s;o lovely; his beauty, and the prai&s;es lavi&s;hed on him, having awakened a &s;park of that flame, which her ambition had &s;tifled for a moment, the girl endeavor'd, at the beginning of the evening, to attract his notice, but in vain: I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee him neglect all her little arts, and treat her with an air of un|affected indifference, which I knew mu&s;t cut her to the &s;oul. She then endeavored to pique him by the mo&s;t flaming advances to Fondville, which, knowing your capri|cious &s;ex as I do, rather alarmed me; I therefore determined to de&s;troy the effect of her arts by playing off, in oppo&s;ition, a more refined &s;pecies of coquetry, which
<PB N="126" REF="128">
turned all Fondville's attention on my&s;elf, and &s;aved Harry from the &s;nare &s;he was laying for him, a &s;nare of all others the harde&s;t to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw I had by the mo&s;t delicate flattery chained Fondville to my carr for the night, and by playing off a few quali|ty airs in&s;pired him with the &s;tronge&s;t contempt for his city partner, I threw my|&s;elf into a chair, where, affecting an ex|ce&s;s of languor and fatigue, and wondering at the amazing con&s;titutions of the coun|try ladies, I declared my intention of danc|ing no more.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Mellifont, who danced with me, &s;at down on one &s;ide, and Fondville on the other, pouring forth a rhap&s;ody of tender non&s;en&s;e, vowing all other women were only foils to me, envying Sir Charles's happine&s;s, and ki&s;&s;ing my hand with an affection of tran&s;port, which plea&s;ed me,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
as I &s;aw it mortified the cit, who &s;at &s;wel|ling with &s;pite in a window near us, in a &s;ituation of mind which I could almo&s;t have pitied.</P>
<P>I &s;at a full hour receiving the homage of both my adorers, my head reclined, and my whole per&s;on in an attitude of the mo&s;t graceful negligence and inattention, when ob&s;erving the Cittadina ready to faint with envy and indignation, turning my eye carele&s;sly on her, O, heavens! Fondville, &s;aid I, you are an inhuman creature; you have ab&s;olutely forgot your partner: then &s;tarting up with Sir Charles rejoined the dance with an air of ea&s;y im|pertinence, which &s;he could not &s;tand, but bur&s;t into tears and withdrew.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know this affair was all of my contriving; I was determined to try the reality of the girl's pa&s;&s;ion, to quiet Harry's con&s;cience as to cruelty of reject|ing

<P>Full of the&s;e ideas, I wrote by one of my &s;ervants to Fondville, immediately after Harry communicated to us the Cittadina's tragedy letter, commanding him to be at this ball, dre&s;t for conque&s;t, to enquire out Mi&s;s We&s;tbrook, whom he had never &s;een, to pretend a &s;udden and violent pa&s;&s;ion for her, and to entreat the honor of being her partner: that it was a whim I had taken into my head, that I would explain my rea&s;ons another time, but in&s;i&s;ted on his implicit obedience.</P>

<P>There are really a great many agree|able people hereabouts: Belmont is the court of this part of the world, and em|ploys its influence, as every court ought to do, in bringing virtue, politene&s;s, and elegant knowledge into fa&s;hion.

<P>I Have heard from my father on the &s;ub|ject of Lady Mary's intended &s;ettle|ment, who extremely di&s;approves my in|tention of entirely declining it, which he thinks cannot be founded on any motives
<PB N="139" REF="141">

That he will talk further with me on this &s;ubject when we meet, but in the mean time ad|vi&s;es me, as a friend zealous for my inte|re&s;t, yet not the le&s;s attentive to my ho|nor, and the propriety of my conduct, to accept the immediate &s;ettlement of 500<HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="142">
a year, which will enable me to be &s;ervice|able to my country; but to po&s;tpone to &s;ome di&s;tant time &s;ettling the whole, and to in&s;i&s;t that Lady Mary be convinced I de&s;erve her friend&s;hip before &s;he lavi&s;hes it &s;o profu&s;ely on me.</P>
<P>This advice gives me plea&s;ure, as it coin|cides with my own pre&s;ent &s;entiments; eager to pur&s;ue my &s;cheme of ri&s;ing to &s;uch con&s;equence as may ju&s;tify my hopes of the only event de&s;irable to me in this world, I am happy in the thought of appearing in every light in which I can attract the notice of my prince; and by &s;teadily &s;erv|ing him and my country, who&s;e true in|tere&s;t mu&s;t ever be the &s;ame, de&s;erve that favor on which all my de&s;igns are founded.</P>
<P>The time not being yet arrived when I can &s;erve the noble&s;t cau&s;e in the &s;enate, I will go to Germany, and endeavour fir&s;t to &s;ignalize my&s;elf in the manner mo&s;t &s;uited

to my period of life, the &s;ea&s;on of action, not of coun&s;el: it is &s;hameful at my age, to recline in the flowery bower of indolence, when the whole world is in arms; I have not yet begun to live; my time has hither|to been le&s;s pa&s;s'd in acting, than in pre|paring to act, my part on the great theatre of human life.</P>
<P>O Mordaunt! &s;hould I &s;ucceed in my views! &s;hould the hour come when I may openly avow my pa&s;&s;ion for the mo&s;t love|ly of womankind! this is the &s;weet hope which fires my &s;oul, and animates me to the glorious pur&s;uit. Why do clo&s;eted morali&s;ts, &s;trangers to the human heart, rail indi&s;criminately at love? when in&s;pir|ed by a worthy object, it leads to every thing that is great and noble; warmed by by the de&s;ire of being approved by her, there is nothing I would not attempt. I will to-day write to my father for his con|&s;ent,
<PB N="142" REF="144">
and embark immediately for the army.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received your letter: you call my de&s;ign madne&s;s, the light in which every animated purpo&s;e will appear to minds in|active, unimpa&s;&s;ioned, and &s;unk in the lethargic calm of lifele&s;s tranquillity.&mdash;Mor|daunt, you &s;peak the cold language of a heart at re&s;t: talk not of impo&s;&s;ibilities; nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to a &s;oul impelled by the mo&s;t lively of all pa&s;&s;ions, and ardent in a pur&s;uit on which its whole happine&s;s depends; nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to him who a&s;pires to plea&s;e the mo&s;t lovely, the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t exalted of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>I feel, I know I &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful; I a&s;k not advice, but declare my &s;ettled pur|po&s;e: I am already determined, and if your friend&s;hip be warm as mine, you will not torture me by further oppo&s;ition. My fa|ther alone has power to change my re&s;olu|tion,
<PB N="143" REF="145">
but it is a power he will not exert: I &s;hall a&s;k his permi&s;&s;ion, but inform him at the &s;ame time, that, by refu&s;ing, he cuts off all the hope of my future days, and chains me down to a life of ta&s;tele&s;s in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I know him well; he will advi&s;e, he will remon&s;trate, if he di&s;approves; but he will leave me that freedom of choice which is the inherent right of every rational being, and which he never, in one in&s;tance, in|vaded, when I was much le&s;s capable of judging for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fearful however le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;approve my pa&s;&s;ion for Lady Julia, I &s;hall not de|clare it to him at pre&s;ent; but, as I never will even tacitly deceive him, I &s;hall tell him I have a motive to this de&s;ign, which I beg his leave to conceal from him till I have a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

I this morning mentioned leaving Bel|mont, but my Lord in&s;i&s;ts on my &s;taying a few days longer, which are devoted to do|me&s;tic happine&s;s.

they might receive from a &s;uperiority in the&s;e outward di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>Did I tell you Lord Belmont had pre|&s;ented me with a beautiful Arabian hor&s;e, which he bought when in town?

<P>IT gives me the warme&s;t plea&s;ure, my dear &s;on, to find you are plea&s;ed with the expen&s;ive education I have given you, though it reduces your fortune con&s;idera|bly below what it might otherwi&s;e have been: I con&s;idered that wealth, if nece&s;|&s;ary to happine&s;s, which I do not believe, might be acquired; but that the flying hours of youth, the &s;ea&s;on of in&s;truction, are never to be recalled.</P>
<P>I have the happine&s;s to &s;ee you reward and ju&s;tify my cares by a generous freedom of thinking, and noblene&s;s of &s;entiment, which the common methods of education might have crampt, or perhaps totally de|&s;troy'd. It has always appeared to me, that
<PB N="147" REF="149">
our under&s;tandings are fettered by &s;y&s;tems, and our hearts corrupted by example: and that there needs no more to minds well di&s;po&s;ed than to recover their native free|dom, and think and act from them&s;elves. Full of this idea, I have in&s;tructed you how, but never what to think; I have pointed out the road which leads to truth, but have left you to di&s;cover her abode by your own &s;trength of mind: even on the mo&s;t im|portant of all &s;ubjects, I have &s;aid no more, than that conviction mu&s;t be on the &s;ide of that religion, which teaches the pure&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent morality, is mo&s;t con|ducive to the general happine&s;s of man|kind, and gives the mo&s;t &s;ublime idea of the Deity.</P>
<P>Convinced that the &s;eeds of virtue are innate, I have only watched to cheri&s;h the ri&s;ing &s;hoots, and prune, but with a trem|bling hand, the too luxuriant branches.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="150">
By virtue I would here be under&s;tood to mean, not a partial attention to any one duty of life, but that rectitude of heart, which leads us to fulfil all, as far as the frailty of human nature will permit, and which is a con&s;tant monitor of our faults. Confu|cius has well ob&s;erved, that virtue does not con&s;i&s;t in never erring, which is impo&s;&s;ible, but in recovering as fa&s;t as we can from our errors.</P>
<P>With what joy, my deare&s;t Harry, did I early &s;ee in you that warmth oftemper, which is alone productive of every extraordinary exertion of the human mind, the proper &s;oil of genius and the virtues; that heat from which light is in&s;eparable!</P>
<P>I have only one fear for you; inured to a habit of profu&s;e expence, I dread your being unable to practice that frugality, which will now be indi&s;pen&s;able. To lady Mary's intended &s;ettlement, I will add a

third of my e&s;tate, but even that is below your birth, and the manner of life to which you are habituated. But why do I doubt you!

<P>Intended to become a part of the legi&s;lative power, you are doubly bound to keep your|&s;elf from all temptation of corruption or de|pendence, by living within your income; the ample&s;t e&s;tate is wretched penury, if ex|ceeded by the expences of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Need I &s;ay more to recommend oecono|my to a &s;pirit like yours, than that it is the fountain of liberality, and the parent of independence?</P>
<P>You enquire after the place where I am: it is, except Belmont, the &s;weete&s;t &s;pot I

There is a mild elegance, a refined &s;implicity in the air of all around, &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the mind of its amiable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or; a poetic wildne&s;s, a luxuriant glow, like that of primeval nature, adorned by the hand of the Graces.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit of liberty breathes here as with you: we are all perfectly at home; our time is &s;ubject to no re&s;traint but that which our de&s;ire of obliging each other makes a voluntary impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I am now alone, &s;itting in an arbour, attentive to the lively chant of the birds, who &s;well their little throats with a morn|ing hymn of gratitude to their creator: whil&s;t I li&s;ten, I think of tho&s;e &s;weet lines of Cowley:<Q><L>" All round the little winged choir,</L>

" With ea&s;e the in&s;piration I obey,</L>

<P>'Tis yet early day: the flocks and herds are &s;preading over the di&s;tant meadows, and joining the univer&s;al &s;ong of prai&s;e to the beneficent Lord of nature.</P>
<P>Rejoicing in the general joy, I adore the God who has expanded &s;o wide the circle of happine&s;s, and endeavour to regulate my own de&s;ires by attending to the &s;impli|city of theirs.</P>
<P>When I &s;ee the dumb creation, my dear Harry, pur&s;uing &s;teadily the purpo&s;es of their being, their own private happine&s;s, and the good of their peculiar &s;pecies, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the folly and degeneracy of man, who acts in general &s;o directly con|trary to both; for both are invariably united.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e and benevolent creator has placed the &s;upreme felicity of every indi|vidual

in tho&s;e kind dome&s;tic &s;ocial affec|tions, which tend to the well-being of the whole. Whoever pre&s;umes to deviate from this plan, the plan of God and nature, &s;hall find &s;atiety, regret, or di&s;appointment his reward.</P>
<P>I this moment receive your letter: you judge perfectly well in &s;aying, there is an activity and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s in the mind of man, which makes it impo&s;&s;ible for him to be happy in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute inaction: &s;ome point of view, &s;ome favourite pur&s;uit is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep the mind awake. 'Tis on this principle alone one can account for what &s;eems &s;o extraordinary to the eyes of impartial rea&s;on, that avarice and ambition &s;hould be the vices of age, that men &s;hould mo&s;t ardently pur&s;ue riches and honours at the time when they have the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of enjoying them; the lively pa&s;&s;ions of youth &s;ub&s;iding, &s;ome active principle mu&s;t be found to replace them; and where that warm benevolence of heart is wanting,

which is a perpetual &s;ource of ever new de|light, I do not wonder they engage in the cha&s;e of wealth and power, though &s;ure &s;o &s;oon to melt from their gra&s;p.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t purpo&s;e of my heart, next to that &s;uperior and general one of making my&s;elf acceptable to my creator, was to render the mo&s;t angelic of women, your lovely mother, happy, in that heaven was plea&s;ed to di&s;appoint my hopes, by taking her to it&s;elf; my &s;econd has been to make you the mo&s;t amiable of men, in which, I am not afraid to &s;ay to your&s;elf, I have been &s;ucce&s;sful, beyond my mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>I Have been riding alone with Lord Bel|mont this morning, a plea&s;ure I very often enjoy, and on which I &s;et infinite value: in tho&s;e hours of perfect confi|dence, I am certain of being in&s;tructed and amu&s;ed, by a train of ideas uncom|mon, enlarged, noble, benevolent; and adapted to in&s;pire me with a love of virtue, by &s;howing her in her native charms: I &s;hall be all my life the wi&s;er and worthier man, for the hours I have pa&s;&s;ed at Bel|mont.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167">
But, O Mordaunt! &s;hall I be the hap|pie&s;t! that is in the bo&s;om of futurity: a thou&s;and times have I been tempted, in the&s;e hours of indulgent friend&s;hip, to open all my heart to Lord Belmont.</P>
<P>I know his contempt of wealth, and how little he thinks it conducive to hap|pine&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Heaven,"</Q> &s;aid he to me this very morning, <Q REND="inline">"has ble&s;t me with afflu|ence: I am thankful, and endeavor to de|&s;erve, by applying an ample portion of it to the purpo&s;es of beneficence. But for my&s;elf, my plea&s;ures are of &s;o unexpen&s;ive and &s;imple a kind, that a diminution of fortune would take very little from my private felicity: Health, content, the &s;weets of &s;ocial and dome&s;tick life, the only en|joyments &s;uited to the nature of man, are and ought to be within the reach of all the &s;pecies: yes, my dear Mr. Mandeville; it gives a double reli&s;h to all my plea&s;ures,
<PB N="166" REF="168">
to reflect that they are &s;uch as every man may enjoy if he will."</Q></P>
<P>Can this man, my dear Mordaunt, &s;a|crifice the real happine&s;s of his child, the calm delight of dome&s;tic friend&s;hip on which he &s;ets &s;uch value him&s;elf, to the gaudy trappings of ta&s;tele&s;s grandeur? Did &s;he approve my pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould hope every thing from the mo&s;t indulgent of fathers.</P>

<P>SHE is come, this redoubtable Emi|ly Howard; and, I find I have only a &s;econd place in Lady Julia's friend&s;hip: I would hate her if I could, but it is really impo&s;&s;ible: &s;he is &s;o gentle, &s;he &s;teals ones affection imperceptibly, and one has the
<PB N="169" REF="171">
vexation to be foced to love her in &s;pite of ones &s;elf.</P>
<P>She has been here three days, and in that &s;hort time &s;he has gained amazingly upon my heart: her per&s;on is little, finely pro|portioned, and delicate almo&s;t to fragili|ty; her voice and manner &s;oft and timid; her countenance a mixture of innocence and &s;weetne&s;s which would di&s;arm the rage of a tyger: her heart is tender, kind, compa&s;&s;ionate; and tremblingly awake to friend&s;hip, of which &s;he is univer&s;ally the object: Lady Julia doats on her, nor am I &s;urprized at it: &s;he appears &s;o weak, &s;o helple&s;s, &s;o exqui&s;itely feminine, it &s;eems cruelty not to be her friend: no one ever &s;aw her without wi&s;hing her happine&s;s: the love one has for her &s;eems of a pecu|liar &s;pecies, or mo&s;t nearly re&s;embles that in&s;tinctive fondne&s;s one feels for a beauti|ful child: it is independent of e&s;teem, for one loves her before one knows her. It is the
<PB N="170" REF="172">
plea&s;ante&s;t kind of affection that can be conceived.</P>
<P>Yet though &s;he is extremely hand&s;ome, or rather, to &s;uit the expre&s;&s;ion to her form, extremely pretty, &s;he is very little the ta&s;te of men; her exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty renders both her beauty and under&s;tand|ing in &s;ome degree u&s;ele&s;s to her; <Q REND="inline">"not obvious not obtru&s;ive,"</Q> &s;he e&s;capes the the ob&s;ervation of common eyes; and though infinitely lovely, I never heard &s;he was beloved.</P>
<P>For this very rea&s;on, the women do her ample ju&s;tice; &s;he is no woman's rival, &s;tands in nobody's way, which cannot fail of exciting a general good will towards her, in her own &s;ex; they even allow her more beauty than &s;he really has, and take a delight in &s;etting her charms in oppo&s;i|tion to every impertinent thing the men are fond of. Yes, <Q REND="inline">"the girl is very well,
<PB N="171" REF="173">
but nothing to Emily Howard,"</Q> is the common cry on the appearance of a new beauty.</P>
<P>There is another &s;trong rea&s;on for lov|ing her; tho' exact in her own conduct, &s;he has an indulgence to that of others, which is a con&s;equence of her exce&s;&s;ive gentlene&s;s of temper, and her &s;eeing every action on the favourable &s;ide: one could own one's greate&s;t weakne&s;s to her almo&s;t without blu&s;hing, and at this very moment I dare &s;ay Lady Julia is confe&s;&s;ing to her her pa&s;&s;ion for Harry Mandeville, who is riding out with my lord. I dare &s;ay &s;he would find an excu&s;e for my indi&s;cretion in regard to you, and &s;ee only the delicacy of our friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>She &s;ings and dances angelically, but &s;he blu&s;hes to death if you tell her &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="174">
Such gentle una&s;&s;uming characters as the&s;e, make the mo&s;t agreeable friends in the world; they are the mild green of the &s;oul, on which it re&s;ts it&s;elf from more glaring objects: one may be ab&s;urd, one may be vain, one may be imprudent, &s;ecure of being heard with indulgence: I know nothing which would make her more what I mean but her being a fool: however the indulgent &s;weetne&s;s of her temper an&s;wers almo&s;t the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am di&s;con&s;olate that the Caro Enrico is going to de&s;ert us; but the cruel man is inflexible to all my &s;oft per&s;wa&s;ions, and determined to leave us on Wedne&s;day.</P>

<P>OUR ramble ye&s;terday was infinitely agreeable; there is &s;omething very charming in changing the &s;cene; my Lord under&s;tands the art of making life plea&s;ur|able by making it various.</P>
<P>We have been to the pari&s;h church, to hear Dr. H. preach; he has that &s;pirit in
<PB N="179" REF="181">
his manner without which the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble &s;ermon has very little effect on the hearers. The organ, which my Lord gave, is excellent. You know I think mu&s;ick an e&s;&s;ential part of public wor&s;hip, u&s;ed as &s;uch by the wi&s;e&s;t nations, and com|manded by God him&s;elf to the Jews; it has indeed &s;o admirable an effect in di&s;po|&s;ing the mind to devotion, that I think it &s;hould never be omitted.</P>
<P>Our Sundays here are extremely plea|&s;ant: we have, after evening &s;ervice, a moving rural picture from the windows of the &s;aloon, in the villagers, for who&s;e a|mu&s;ement the gardens are that day thrown open.</P>
<P>Our ru&s;tic Mall is full from five till eight, and there is an inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure in contemplating &s;o many groups of neat, healthy, happy-looking people, enjoying the diver&s;ion of walking in the&s;e lovely
<PB N="180" REF="182">
&s;hades, by the kindne&s;s of their beneficent Lord, who not only provides for their wants, but their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>My Lord is of opinion that Sunday was intended as a day of rejoicing not of mor|tification; and meant not only to render our prai&s;es to our benevolent Creator, but to give re&s;t and chearful relaxation to the indu&s;trious part of mankind, from the la|bors of the week.</P>
<P>On this principle, tho he will never &s;uf|fer the lea&s;t breach of the laws in being, he wi&s;hes the &s;everity of them &s;oftened, by allowing &s;ome innocent amu&s;ements after the duties of the day are pa&s;t: he thinks this would prevent tho&s;e fumes of enthu|&s;ia&s;m which have had here &s;uch fatal ef|fects, and could not be offen&s;ive to that gracious power who delights in the happi|ne&s;s of his creatures, and who by the royal poet has commanded them to prai&s;e him in the cymbals and dances.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">
For my own part, having &s;een the good effect of this liberty in catholic countries, I cannot help wi&s;hing, though a zealous prote&s;tant, that we were to imitate them in this particular.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, that the book of &s;ports was put forth by the pious, the reli|gious, the &s;ober Charles the 1&s;t, and the law for the more &s;trict ob&s;ervation of Sun|day pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the libertine Charles the 2d.</P>

<P>MORDAUNT, the die is ca&s;t, and the whole happine&s;s of my life hangs on the pre&s;ent moment. After having kept the letter confe&s;&s;ing my pa&s;|&s;ion two days without having re&s;olution to deliver it, this morning in the gar|den, being a moment alone with Lady Ju|lia in a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, the company at &s;ome di&s;tance, I a&s;&s;umed courage to lay it on a table whil&s;t &s;he was looking out at a window which had a pro&s;pect that engag'd all her attention: when I laid it down, I trembled, a chillne&s;s &s;eized my whole frame, my heart dy'd within me; I with|drew in&s;tantly, without even &s;taying to &s;ee if &s;he took it up: I waited at a little di&s;t|ance hid in a clo&s;e arbour of woodbines, my heart throbbing with apprehen&s;ion, and
<PB N="183" REF="185">
by the time &s;he &s;taid in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, had no doubt of her having &s;een the let|ter: when &s;he appeared I was &s;till more convinced; &s;he came out with a timid air, and looked round as if fearful of &s;urprize: the lively crim&s;on flu&s;h'd her cheek, and and was &s;ucceeded by a dying palene&s;s; I attempted to follow, but had not courage to approach her. I &s;uffered her to pa&s;s the arbor where I was, and advance &s;lowly to|wards the hou&s;e: when &s;he was out of &s;ight I went back to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and found the letter was gone. I have not &s;een her. I am called to dinner: my limbs will &s;carce &s;upport me: how &s;hall I bear the fir&s;t &s;ight of Lady Julia! how be able to meet her eyes!</P>
<P>I have &s;een her, but my fate is yet un|determined; &s;he has avoided my eyes, which I have &s;carce dar'd to rai&s;e from the ground: I once look'd at her when &s;he did
<PB N="184" REF="186">
not ob&s;erve me, and &s;aw a melancholy on her countenance which &s;tab'd me to the &s;oul. I have given &s;orrow to the heart of her, whom I would wi&s;h to be ever mo&s;t happy; and to who&s;e good I would &s;acri|fice the deare&s;t hope of my &s;oul. Yes, Mordaunt, let me be wretched, but let every ble&s;&s;ing heaven can be&s;tow, be the portion of the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>How little did I know of love, when I gave that name to the &s;hameful pa&s;&s;ion I felt for the wife of my friend! the ex|treme beauty of the counte&s;s Mele&s;pini, that unre&s;erved manner which &s;eldom fails to give hope, the flattering preference &s;he &s;eemed to give me above all others, light|ed up in my &s;oul a more violent degree of youthful inclination, which the e&s;teem I had for her virtues refined to an appearance of the noble&s;t of affections, to which it had not the remote&s;t real re&s;emblance.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">
Without any view in my pur&s;uit of her but my own &s;elfi&s;h gratification, I would have &s;acrificed her honor and happine&s;s to a tran&s;ient fondne&s;s, which di&s;honored my character, and, if &s;ucce&s;sful, might have corrupted a heart naturally full of probity; her amiable reproofs, free from that feve|rity which robs virtue of half her charms, with the generous behaviour of the mo&s;t injured of mankind, recalled my &s;oul to honor, and &s;toped me early in the career of folly; time wore out the impre&s;&s;ion of her charms, and left only a cold e&s;teem remaining, a certain proof that &s;he was ne|ver the object of more than a light de&s;ire, &s;ince the wounds which real love inflicts are never to be intirely healed.</P>
<P>Such was the infamous pa&s;&s;ion which I yet remember with horror: but my tender|ne&s;s for Lady Julia, more warm, more animated, more violent, has a delicacy of which tho&s;e only who love like me can
<PB N="186" REF="188">
form any idea: independent of the charms of her per&s;on, it can never cea&s;e but with life; nor even then if in another &s;tate we have any &s;en&s;e of what has pa&s;&s;ed in this; it is eternal, and incorporated with the &s;oul. Above every &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire, the fir&s;t object of my thoughts and wi&s;hes is her happine&s;s, which I would die, or live wretched, to &s;ecure: every action of my life is directed to the &s;ole purpo&s;e of plea&s;|ing her: my noble&s;t ambition is to be worthy her e&s;teem. My dreams are full of her; and when I wake, the fir&s;t idea which ri&s;es in my mind is the hope of &s;ee|ing her, and of &s;eeing her well and happy: my mo&s;t ardent prayer to the &s;upreme Giver of all good is for her welfare.</P>
<P>In true love, my dear Mordaunt, there is a plea&s;ure ab&s;tracted from all hope of return; and were I certain &s;he would ne|ver be mine, nay, certain I &s;hould never behold her more, I would not, for all the
<PB N="187" REF="189">
kingdoms of the world, give up the dear delight of loving her.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who never felt this enlivening power, this divinity of the &s;oul, may find a poor in&s;ipid plea&s;ure in tranquillity, or plunge into vicious exce&s;&s;es to animate their tedious hours; but tho&s;e who have, can never give up &s;o &s;weet, &s;o divine a tran&s;port, but with their exi&s;tence, or ta&s;te any other joy but in &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>O Mordaunt! when I behold her, read the &s;oft language of tho&s;e &s;peaking eyes, hear tho&s;e harmonious &s;ounds&mdash;who that has a &s;oul can be in&s;en&s;ible!&mdash;yet there are men dead to all &s;en&s;e of perfection, who can re|gard that angel form without rapture, can hear the mu&s;ic of that voice without emo|tion! I have my&s;elf with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;een them, inanimate as the trees around them, li&s;ten coldly to tho&s;e melting
<PB N="188" REF="190">
accents&mdash;There is a &s;weetne&s;s in her voice, Mordaunt, a melodious &s;oftne&s;s, which fancy cannot paint: the enchantment of her con|ver&s;ation is inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>I am the mo&s;t wretched of mankind, and wretched without the right of complain|ing: the ba&s;ene&s;s of my attempt de&s;erves even the pangs I &s;uffer. Could I, who made a parade of refu&s;ing to meet the ad|vances of the daughter of almo&s;t a &s;tranger, de&s;cend to &s;educe the heire&s;s of him on earth to whom I am mo&s;t obliged? O Mordaunt! have we indeed two &s;ouls? Can I &s;ee &s;o &s;trongly what is right, yet want power to act up to my own &s;enti|ments? The torrent of pa&s;&s;ion bears down all before it.

<P>This day, the fir&s;t of my life; what a change has this day produced! The&s;e few flying hours have rai&s;ed me above mortality. Yes: I am mo&s;t happy; &s;he loves me, Mordaunt: her con&s;cious blu&s;hes, her downca&s;t eyes, her heaving bo&s;om, her &s;weet confu&s;ion, have told me what her tongue could not utter: &s;he loves me, and all el&s;e is below my care: &s;he loves me, and I will pur&s;ue her. What are the mean
<PB N="190" REF="192">
con&s;iderations of fortune to the tender uni|on of hearts? Can wealth or titles de&s;erve her? No, Mordaunt, love alone.&mdash;She is mine by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, by the &s;acred bond of affection. The delicacy of her &s;oul is my certain pledge of happine&s;s: I can leave her without fear; &s;he cannot now be another's.</P>
<P>I told you my de&s;pair this morning; my Lord propo&s;ed an airing; chance placed me in lady Julia's chai&s;e. I enter|ed it with a beating hearr: a tender fear of having offended, in&s;eparable from real love, kept me &s;ome time &s;ilent; at length, with &s;ome he&s;itation, I beg'd her to par|don the effect of pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair, vowed I would rather die than di&s;plea&s;e her; that I did not now hope for her love, but could not &s;upport her hate.</P>
<P>I then ventured to look up to the lovelie&s;t of women; her cheeks were &s;uf|fu&s;ed
<PB N="191" REF="193">
with the deepe&s;t blu&s;h; her eyes, in which was the mo&s;t dying languor, were ca&s;t timidly on the ground, her whole frame trembled, and with a voice broken and interrupted, &s;he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hate you, Mr. Mandeville, O heaven!"</Q> &s;he could &s;ay no more; nor did &s;he need, the dear truth broke like a &s;udden fla&s;h of light on my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Yet think not I will take advantage of this dear prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my favor, to &s;e|duce her from her duty to the be&s;t of pa|rents; from Lord Belmont only will I re|ceive her: I will propo&s;e no engagements contrary to the rights of an indulgent fa|ther, to whom &s;he is bound by every tie of gratitude and filial tenderne&s;s: I will pur|&s;ue my purpo&s;e, and leave the event to heaven, to that heaven which knows the in|tegrity, the di&s;intere&s;ted purity of my in|tentions: I will evince the reality of my
<PB N="192" REF="194">
pa&s;&s;ion by endeavoring to be worthy of her. The love of &s;uch a woman, is the love of virtue it&s;elf: it rai&s;es, it refines, it en|nobles every &s;entiment of the heart; how different from that fever of &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire I felt for the amiable counte&s;s.</P>
<P>O Mordaunt! had you beheld tho&s;e blu&s;hes of reluctant &s;en&s;ibility, &s;een tho&s;e charming eyes &s;oftened with a tenderne&s;s as refined as that of angels.&mdash;She loves me&mdash;let me repeat the dear &s;ounds.&mdash;She loves me, and I am happier than a god!</P>
<P>I have this moment a letter from my father: he approves my de&s;ign, but begs me for a &s;hort time to delay it: my heart ill bears this delay: I will carry the letter to lady Julia.</P>
<P>She approves my father's rea&s;ons, yet begs I will leave Belmont: her will is the
<PB N="193" REF="195">
law of my heart; yet a few days I mu&s;t give to love. I will go on Tue&s;day to lord T&mdash;'s. His friend&s;hip will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the only view which makes life &s;upportable to me; he will point out, he will lead me to the path of wealth and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Expect to hear from me when I arrive at Lord T&mdash;'s. I &s;hall not write &s;ooner: my moments here are too precious.</P>

<P>Yes, my &s;on, I am well a&s;&s;ured we &s;hall have peace; that the mo&s;t amiable of

princes, the friend of humankind, pitying the mi&s;eries of his &s;pecies, and melting with compa&s;&s;ion at the wide extended &s;cene of de&s;olation, meditates &s;uch a peace as equally provides for the intere&s;t and honor of Britain, and the future quiet of man|kind. The terms talked of are &s;uch as give us an immen&s;e addition of empire, and &s;trengthen that &s;uperiority of naval force on which our very being depends, whil&s;t they protect our former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and remove the &s;ource of future wars, by &s;ecuring all, and much more than all, for which this was undertaken; yet, by their ju&s;t moderation, convince the world a Briti&s;h monarch is governed only by the laws of honor and equity, not by that im|pious thir&s;t of fal&s;e glory, which actuates the laurel'd &s;courges of mankind.</P>
<P>After &s;o long, &s;o exten&s;ive and bloody a war, a war which had depopulated our

<P>Heaven and earth! can men wearing the form, and profe&s;&s;ing the &s;entiments of hu|manity, deaf to the cries of the widow and the orphan, labor to perpetuate the dread|ful carnage, which has deluged the world

with the blood of their fellow creatures, only to add to the ma&s;s of their already unweildy wealth, and prey longer on the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country!</P>
<P>The&s;e clamors are as illegal as they are indecent: peace and war are the preroga|tive of the crown, &s;acred as the liberties of the people, nor will ever be invaded by tho&s;e who under&s;tand and love our happy con&s;titution: let us &s;trengthen the hands of our &s;overeign by our warm approbation during the cour&s;e of this arduous work, and if his mini&s;ters abu&s;e their tru&s;t, let them an&s;wer it, not to the noi&s;e of unthinking faction, or the unfeeling bo&s;om of private intere&s;t, but to the impartial laws of their country.</P>
<P>Heaven forbid I &s;hould ever &s;ee a Briti&s;h King independent on his people collective|ly; but I would have him rai&s;ed above

private cabals, or the influence of any par|tial body of men, however wealthy or re|&s;pectable.</P>
<P>If the generous views of our Prince do not meet with the &s;ucce&s;s they merit, if France refu&s;es &s;uch a peace as &s;ecures the &s;afety of our colonies, and that &s;uperiority, as a naval power, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the liber|ties of Europe, as well as our own inde|pendence, you &s;hall join the army in a man|ner becoming your birth, and the &s;tyle of life in which you have been educated: till then re&s;train within ju&s;t bounds that noble ardor &s;o becoming a Briton, and &s;tudy to &s;erve that country with your coun&s;els in peace, which will not, I hope, have occa|&s;ion for your &s;word in war.

<P>MY Emily, your friend, your un|happy Julia, is undone. He knows the tenderne&s;s which I have &s;o long en|deavored to conceal. The trial was too great for the &s;oftne&s;s of a heart like mine; I had almo&s;t conquered my own pa&s;&s;ion, when I became a victim to his: I could not &s;ee his love, his de&s;pair, without emotions which di&s;covered all my &s;oul: I am not formed for deceit: artle&s;s as the village maid, every &s;entiment of my &s;oul is in my eyes; I have not learnt, I will never learn to di&s;gui&s;e their expre&s;&s;ive language. With what pain did I affect a coldne&s;s to
<PB N="200" REF="202">
which I was indeed a &s;tranger! But why do I wrong my own heart? I did not af|fect it. The native mode&s;ty of my &s;ex gave a re&s;erve to my behavior, on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of his pa&s;&s;ion, which his fears magnified into hate. O, Emily! Do I in|deed hate him! you to who&s;e dear bo&s;om your Julia confides her every thought, tell me if I hate this mo&s;t amiable of man|kind? You know by what imperceptible &s;teps my inexperienced heart has been &s;educed to love: you know how deceived by the &s;acred name of friend&s;hip&mdash;But why do I &s;eek to excu&s;e my &s;en&s;ibility? Is he not worthy all my tenderne&s;s? are we not equal in all but wealth, a con|&s;ideration below my care? is not his merit above titles and riches? How &s;hall I paint his delicacy, his re&s;pectful fondne&s;s? Too plainly convinced of his power over my heart, he di&s;dains to u&s;e that power to my di&s;advantage; he declares he will never receive me but from my father, he con|&s;ents
<PB N="201" REF="203">
to leave me till a happier fortune enables him to avow his love to all the world; he goes without a&s;king the lea&s;t promi&s;e in his favor. Heaven &s;ure will pro&s;per his de&s;igns, will reward a heart like his. O, my Emily, did my father &s;ee with my eyes! what is fortune in the ballance with &s;uch virtue! Had I worlds in my own power, I &s;hould value them only as they enabled me to &s;how more &s;trongly the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my affec|tion.</P>
<P>Born with a too tender heart, which never before found an object worthy its attach|ment, the exce&s;s of my affection is un|&s;peakable. Delicate in my choice even of friends, it was not ea&s;y to find a lover equal to that idea of perfection my imagination had formed; he alone of all mankind ri&s;es up to it; the &s;peaking grace, the ea&s;y dignity of his air, are the natural con&s;e|quences of the &s;uperiority of his &s;oul.

<P>WE have lo&s;t our lovely Harry; he left us this morning for Lord T&mdash;s. Poor Lady Julia! how I adore her amiable &s;incerity! &s;he has owned her pa&s;&s;ion to me as we aired, and mentioned hopes which are founded in madne&s;s: I ven|tured gently to remon&s;trate, but there is no rea&s;oning with a heart in love. Time and ab&s;ence may effect a cure: I am the con|fidente of both: I am perplexed how to proceed: I mu&s;t either betray the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in me, or abu&s;e Lord Belmont's friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>In what a fal&s;e light do we &s;ee every thing through the medium of pa&s;&s;ion! Lady Julia is heire&s;s to 14,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, yet
<PB N="210" REF="212">
thinks Harry's merit may rai&s;e him to a &s;ituation which will ju&s;tify his pretending to her, and that this &s;tupendous ri&s;e may be brought about in a twelvemonth: he too thinks it po&s;&s;ible, nay the &s;cheme is his. Heaven and earth! yet they are not fools, and Harry has &s;ome knowledge of mankind.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there is no talking rea&s;on|ably to either of them: I mu&s;t &s;oothe them, to bring them off this ruinous incli|nation by degrees.</P>
<P>As idlene&s;s is the nur&s;e of love, I will endeavor to keep Lady Julia continually amu&s;ed: a new lover might do much, but there is nobody near us that is tolerable: indeed the woman who has loved Harry Mandeville, will be &s;omewhat hard to plea&s;e.</P>

Chance favors my de&s;igns, my Lord has propo&s;ed a vi&s;it of a fortnight to a neighbouring nobleman, Lord Rochdale, who&s;e hou&s;e is generally full of gay peo|ple; his &s;on too, Lord Melvin, with whom I was acquainted abroad, and who is only inferior to Harry Mandeville, is hourly expected from his travels.</P>
<P>Since I wrote the la&s;t paragraph an idea has &s;truck me; from a very particular ex|pre&s;&s;ion in a letter I once received from Lady Belmont, in France, I have a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion Lord Melvin is intended for Lady Julia; I wi&s;h he might be agreeable to her, for her pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion is ab&s;olute di&s;|traction.</P>

<HEAD>TO HENRY MANDEVILLE, E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Mount Melvin, <DATE>THURSDAY.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Never &s;o &s;trongly reli&s;h the happine&s;s of my own manner of living, as when I compare it with that of others. I hear perpetual complaints abroad of the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of life, and &s;ee in every face a certain wearine&s;s of them&s;elves, from which I am &s;o happy as to be perfectly free. I carry about me an innate di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;|ed, which is the &s;ource of continual plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>That I have e&s;caped what is in general the fate of people of my rank, is chiefly owing to my fortunate choice in marriage: our mutual pa&s;&s;ion, the only foundation on which &s;en&s;ible &s;ouls can build happine&s;s, has been kept alive by a delicacy of beha|viour, an angel purity, in Lady Belmont,
<PB N="215" REF="217">
to which words cannot do ju&s;tice. The tran&s;ports of youthful pa&s;&s;ion yield its &s;weetne&s;s to the delight of that refined, yet animated &s;en&s;ation which my heart feels for her at this moment. I never leave her without regret, nor meet her without rap|ture, the lively rapture of love,<Q><L>" By long experience mellowed into friend&s;hip,"</L></Q> We have been married thirty years: there are people who think &s;he was never hand&s;ome; yet to me &s;he is all loveline&s;s. I think no woman beautiful but as &s;he re|&s;embles her; and even Julia's greate&s;t charm, in my eye, is the likene&s;s &s;he has to her amiable mother.</P>
<P>This tender, this exqui&s;ite affection, has diffu&s;ed a &s;pirit through our whole lives, and given a charm to the mo&s;t common occurrences; a charm to which the dulne&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="218">
of apathy, and the fever of guilty pa&s;&s;ion, are equally &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The family where we are furni&s;h a &s;trik|ing example of the impo&s;&s;ibility of being happy without the &s;oft union of hearts: though both worthy people, having been joined by their parents, without that affec|tion which can alone make &s;o near a con|nexion &s;upportable, their lives pa&s;s on in a tedious and in&s;ipid round: without ta&s;te for each other's conver&s;ation, they engage in a perpetual &s;eries of diver&s;ions, not to give reli&s;h to, but to exclude, tho&s;e retired dome&s;tic hours, which are the mo&s;t &s;pright|ly, and animated of my life; they &s;eek, by crowds and amu&s;ements, to fly from each other and from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The great &s;ecret of human happine&s;s, my dear Mr. Mandeville, con&s;i&s;ts in finding &s;uch con&s;tant employment for the mind, as,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
without over-fatiguing, may prevent its langui&s;hing in a painful inactivity. To this end I would recommend to every man to have not only &s;ome important point in view, but many &s;ubordinate ones, to fill up tho&s;e vacant hours, when our great pur|po&s;e, whatever it is, mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended: our very plea&s;ures, even the be&s;t, will fa|tigue, if not relieved by variety: the mind cannot always be on the &s;tretch, nor at|tentive to the &s;ame object, however plea&s;|ing: Relaxation is as nece&s;&s;ary as activity, to keep the &s;oul in its due equipoi&s;e. No innocent amu&s;ement, however trifling it may &s;eem to the rigid or the proud, is be|low the regard of a rational creature, which keeps the mind in play, and unbends it from more &s;erious pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>I often regard at once with pity and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, per&s;ons of my own rank and age, dragged about in unwieldy &s;tate, forg|ing for them&s;elves the galling fetters of
<PB N="218" REF="220">
eternal ceremony, or the &s;till heavier chains of ambition; their bodies bending under the weight of dre&s;s, their minds for ever filled with the idea of their own dignity and importance; to the fear of le&s;&s;ening which, they &s;acrifice all the genuine plea|&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>Heaven grant, my dear friend, I may never be too wi&s;e, or too proud, to be happy!</P>
<P>To you, my amiable friend, who are ju&s;t entering on the &s;tage of life, I would recommend &s;uch active pur&s;uits as may make you an u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, and contribute to rai&s;e your own fortune and con&s;equence in the world, as well as &s;e|cure the e&s;teem of your fellow citizens, and the approbation of your Prince.</P>
<P>For my own part, like the Roman ve|terans, I may now be excu&s;ed, if I a&s;k
<PB N="219" REF="221">
my di&s;charge from tho&s;e anxious pur&s;uits, which are only becoming in the vigor of our days, and from tho&s;e ceremonial atten|tions, which are &s;carce bearable even then. My duty as a &s;enator, and my re&s;pect to my king, nothing but real inability &s;hall ever &s;u&s;pend; but for the re&s;t, I think it time at &s;ixty to be free, to live to one's &s;elf, and in one's own way; and endeavour to <HI>be,</HI> rather than to <HI>&s;eem</HI> happy.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of my days, except tho&s;e I owe to my country and my prince, &s;hall be de|voted to the &s;weets of conjugal and pater|nal affection, to the lively joys of friend|&s;hip. I have only one wi&s;h as to this world, to &s;ee Julia married to a man who de&s;erves her, who has &s;en&s;ibility to make her happy, and who&s;e rank and fortune are &s;uch as may ju&s;tify us to the world, above which the mo&s;t philo&s;ophic mind cannot entirely ri&s;e; let me but &s;ee this, and have a hope that they will pur&s;ue my

plan of life, let me &s;ee them ble&s;t in each other, and ble&s;&s;ing all around them, and my mea&s;ure of earthly felicity will be com|plete.</P>
<P>You know not, my dear Mr. Mande|ville, how much my happine&s;s in this world has been owing al&s;o to the lively hope of another: this idea has given me a con|&s;tant &s;erenity, which may not improperly be called the health of the mind, and which has diffu&s;ed a brightne&s;s over all my hours.</P>
<P>Your account of Lord T&mdash; made me &s;mile; his fear of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at &s;even|ty from the toil&s;ome drudgery of bu&s;ine&s;s, is truly ridiculous: rich, childi&s;h, infirm, ought not ea&s;e and retirement to be the fir&s;t objects of his wi&s;hes? But &s;uch is the wretched &s;lavery of all who are under the ab&s;olute dominion of any pa&s;&s;ion, unguid|ed by the hand of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">
The pa&s;&s;ions of every kind, under pro|per re&s;traints, are the gentle breezes which keep life from &s;tagnation; but, let loo&s;e, they are the &s;torms and whirlwinds which tear up all before them, and &s;catter ruin and de&s;truction around.</P>
<P>Adieu. I ought to apologize for the length of this; but age is the &s;ea&s;on of garrulity.</P>

<P>HOW happy would it be for mankind, if every per&s;on of your Lord&s;hip's rank and fortune governed them&s;elves by the &s;ame generous maxims!</P>
<P>It is with infinite pain I &s;ee Lord T&mdash; pur&s;uing a plan, which has drawn on him the cur&s;e of thou&s;ands, and made his e&s;tate a &s;cene of de&s;olation: his farms are in the hands of a few men, to whom the &s;ons of the old tenants are either forced to be &s;er|vants, or to leave the country to get their bread el&s;ewhere. The village, large, and once populous, is reduced to about eight families; a dreary &s;ilence reigns over their de&s;erted fields; the farm hou&s;es, once the &s;eats of chearful &s;miling indu&s;try, now u&s;e|le&s;s,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
are falling in ruins around him; his tenants are merchants and engro&s;&s;ers, proud, lazy, luxurious, in&s;olent, and &s;purning the hand which feeds them.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday one of them went off largely in his debt: I took that occa&s;ion of pre&s;&s;ing him on his mo&s;t vulnerable &s;ide, and remon|&s;trating the danger of tru&s;ting &s;o much of his property in one hand: but I am afraid all I can &s;ay will have no effect, as he has, by this narrow &s;elfi&s;h plan, a little encrea&s;|ed his rents at pre&s;ent, which is all he has in view, without extending his thoughts to that future time, when this wretched policy, by depopulating the country, will lower the price of all the fruits of the earth, and le&s;&s;en, in con&s;equence, the value of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>With all my friend&s;hip for Lord T&mdash;, I cannot help ob&s;erving in him another fault greatly below his rank and under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="224" REF="226">
I mean a de&s;picable kind of pride, which mea&s;ures worth by the gifts of for|tune, of which the large&s;t portion is too often in the hands of the lea&s;t de&s;erving.</P>
<P>His treatment of &s;ome gentlemen, who&s;e fortunes were unequal to their birth and me|rit, ye&s;terday, at his table, almo&s;t determin|ed me to leave his hou&s;e: I expo&s;tulated warmly, tho' not impolitely with him on the &s;ubject, and almo&s;t got him to confe&s;s his error. My friend&s;hip for him, makes me feel &s;en&s;ibly what mu&s;t le&s;&s;en his character in the eyes of all who&s;e e&s;teem is de&s;ireable. I wi&s;h him to pa&s;s a month at Belmont, that he may &s;ee dignity without pride, and con|de&s;cen&s;ion without meanne&s;s; that he may &s;ee virtue in her lovelie&s;t form, and acknow|ledge her genuine beauty.</P>

<P>I Have pa&s;t a tedious fortnight at Lord T&mdash;'s, without ta&s;ting any plea&s;ure, but that of talking of Lady Julia, with &s;ome ladies in the neighbourhood who know her: I e&s;timate the merit of tho&s;e I conver&s;e with, by the di&s;tinction of being known to her: tho&s;e who are &s;o happy as to be of her acquaintance, have in my eye, every charm that poli&s;hed wit, or elegant knowledge can give; tho&s;e who want that advantage &s;carce de&s;erve the name of hu|man beings: all conver&s;ation of which &s;he is not the &s;ubject, is lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid; all of which &s;he is, brilliant and divine.</P>
<P>My Lord rallies me on my frequent vi&s;its to the&s;e Ladies, and, as one of them is extremely hand&s;ome, &s;uppo&s;es it a be|ginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;&s;ion: the Lady her&s;elf, I am

<P>OH, do you know I have a little re|que&s;t to make you? but fir&s;t, by way of preface, I mu&s;t inform you Lady Belmont, has been reading me a &s;erious lecture about the Caro Bellville, who has wrote to her to beg her interce&s;&s;ion in his favor.</P>
<P>I find fools have been impertinent in re|gard to our friend&s;hip: there are &s;o few plea&s;ures in this world, I think it extreme|ly hard to give up one &s;o lively, yet in|nocent, as that of indulging a tender e&s;teem for an amiable man. But to our conver|&s;ation:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Lady Anne, I am con|vinced you love Colonel Bellville."</Q></P>
<P>Love him, Madam? no, I rather think not; I am not &s;ure: The man is not &s;hocking, and dies for me: I pity him poor creature,
<PB N="229" REF="231">
and pity, your Lady&s;hip knows, is a kin to love.</P>
<P>Will you be grave one moment?</P>
<P>A thou&s;and, if your Lady&s;hip de&s;ires it: nothing &s;o ea&s;y to me; the grave&s;t creature in the world naturally.</P>

<P>That he loves you?</P>
<P>To di&s;traction.</P>
<P>And you return it?</P>
<P>Why as to that&mdash;he flatters agreeably, and I am fond of his conver&s;ation on that account: and let me tell you, my dear Lady Belmont, it is not every man that can flatter; it requires more genius than one would &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232">
You intend &s;ome time or other to marry him?</P>
<P>Marry? O heavens! How did &s;uch a thought enter your Lady&s;hip's imagina|tion? Have not I been married already? And is not once enough in con&s;cience, for any rea&s;onable woman!</P>
<P>Will you pardon me if I then a&s;k, with what view you allow his addre&s;s?</P>
<P>I allow? Heavens, Lady Belmont! I allow the addre&s;&s;es of an odious male ani|mal? if fellows will follow one, how is to be avoided! it is ones misfortune to be hand&s;ome, and one mu&s;t bear the con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>But, my dear Lady Anne, an unconect|ed life,&mdash;Is the plea&s;ante&s;t life in the world. Have not I 3000<HI>l.</HI> a year? am not I a widow? mi&s;tre&s;s of my own ac|tions? with youth, health, a tolerable un|der&s;tanding,

<P>Now I prote&s;t I think it is va&s;tly to the purpo&s;e. And all this you advi&s;e me to give up to become a tame dome&s;tic, in|animate&mdash;really my dear Madam, I did not think it was in your nature to be &s;o unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>It is with infinite pain, my deare&s;t Lady Anne, I bring my&s;elf to &s;ay any thing
<PB N="232" REF="234">
which can give you a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s. But it is the ta&s;k of true friend&s;hip&mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="234" REF="236">
But is it not po&s;&s;ible to remove tho&s;e rea&s;ons?</P>

to the fal&s;e opinion of a world, governed by prejudice judging by the exterior, which is generally fallacious, and condemning, without di&s;tinction, tho&s;e &s;oft affections without which life is &s;carcely above vege|tation?</P>
<P>Do not imagine, my dear Lady Belmont, I have really the levity I affect: or, had my prejudices again&s;t marriage been ever &s;o &s;trong, the time I have pa&s;&s;ed here would have removed them: I &s;ee my Lord and you, after an union of thirty years, with as keen a reli&s;h for each other's con|ver&s;ation as you could have felt at the mo|ment which fir&s;t joined you: I &s;ee in you all the attention, the tender &s;olicitude of beginning love, with the calm delight and perfect confidence of habitual friend&s;hip. I am therefore convinced marriage is ca|pable of happine&s;s, to which an uncon|nected &s;tate is lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid; and from ob&s;erving the lovely delicacy of your

Lady&s;hip's conduct, I am in&s;tructed how that happine&s;s is to be &s;ecured; I am in|&s;tructed how to avoid that ta&s;tele&s;s, languid, unimpa&s;&s;ioned hour, &s;o fatal to love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>With the man to whom I was a victim, my life was one continued &s;cene of mi&s;ery; to a &s;en&s;ible mind, there is no cold me|dium in marriage; its &s;orrows, like its plea&s;ures, are exqui&s;ite. Relieved from tho&s;e galling chains, I have met with a heart &s;uited to my own; born with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;ame peculiar turn of thinking: plea&s;ed with the &s;ame plea|&s;ures and exactly formed to make me happy: I will belive this &s;imilarity was not given to condemn us both to wretch|edne&s;s: as it is impo&s;&s;ible either of us can be happy but with the other, I will hope the bar, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems invinci|ble, may be removed: till then indulge me, my dear Lady Belmont, in the inno|cent

plea&s;ure of loving him, and tru&s;t to his honor for the &s;afety of mine.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t candid and amiable of women, after a gentle remon&s;trance on the impor|tance of reputation to happine&s;s, left me, &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied, that &s;he intends to invite Bellville down. I &s;end you this conver&s;ati|on as an introduction to a reque&s;t I have to make you, which I mu&s;t po&s;tpone to my next. Heavens! how perver&s;e! interrupted by one of the verie&s;t cats in nature, who will not leave us till ages after the po&s;t is gone. Adieu! for the pre&s;ent! it is preti|ly enough contrived, and one of the great advantages of &s;ociety, that ones time, the mo&s;t precious of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, is to be &s;acrifi&s;ed, from a fal&s;e politene&s;s to every idle creature who knows not what el&s;e to do. Every body complains of this, but nobody attempts to remedy it.</P>

Am not I the mo&s;t inhuman of women, to write two &s;heets without naming Lady Julia? She is well, and beautiful as an angel: we have a ball to-night on Lord Melvin's return, again&s;t which &s;he is put|ting on all her charms. We &s;hall be at Belmont to-morrow, which is two or three days &s;ooner than my Lord intended.</P>
<P>Lady Julia dances with Lord Melvin, who is, except two, the mo&s;t amiable man I know: &s;he came up ju&s;t as I &s;at down to write, and looked as if &s;he had &s;omething to &s;ay: &s;he is gone, however, without a word; her childi&s;h ba&s;hfulne&s;s about you is intolerable.</P>
<P>The ball waits for us. I am interrupt|ed by extreme pretty fellow, Sir Charles Mellifont, who has to-night the honor of my hand. Adio!</P>

<P>O Lady Anne! can you indeed know what it is to love, yet play with the anxie|ty of a tender heart? I can &s;carce bear the thought of her looking lovely in my ab|&s;ence, or in any eyes but mine; how then can I &s;upport the idea of her endeavoring to plea&s;e another, of her putting on all her charms to grace the return of a man, young, amiable, rich, noble, and the &s;on of her father's friend? a thou&s;and fears, a thou&s;and conjectures torment me: &s;hould &s;he love another&mdash;the po&s;&s;ibility di&s;tracts
