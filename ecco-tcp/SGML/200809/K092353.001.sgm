<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM well aware that &s;ome of the ear|lie&s;t Letters to be met in this Collec|tion will, at fir&s;t Glance, appear too trivial for Publication; and that Per&s;ons, who limit their Peru&s;al to them, will be apt to pronounce unfavourably of the whole. I therefore think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ign my Rea&s;ons for including them, and, at the &s;ame Time, give a &s;hort Ac|count of the Work in general.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters are truly, what they are announced in the Title-page, <HI>Genuine.</HI> The Lady, to whom they were written, entru&s;ted me with the Publication. On my fir&s;t Peru&s;al of them, I thought they contained Matter much too good to be lo&s;t. The moral Le&s;&s;ons, wherewith they abound, being chiefly calculated for younger Minds, I took the Liberty in my Propo&s;als to recommend the Work as a
<PB N="xvi" REF="14">
proper Companion to the Time of Edu|cation in both Sexes. Tho&s;e Letters, which contain Critiques on many celebrated Writers, appeared to me not unworthy the Notice of Men of Reading and Eru|dition. I revi&s;ed and tran&s;cribed tho&s;e on <HI>Homer,</HI> in particular, with the Original, and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Tran&s;lation at my hand, and can, at lea&s;t, venture to affirm there is a great Deal of <HI>New</HI> in Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Re|marks. I declare, with great Truth, that I have his Reputation at Heart, more than my own Emolument, and therefore hope, for his Sake, my weak Judgment may not be called in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>My Motive for retaining tho&s;e initiatory Letters, which &s;eem le&s;s con&s;equential, were partly in hope that they might have the &s;ame good Effect on other Pupils, which they had on his. It may be object|ed that they contain Rules which are to be found in every French Grammar. Grant|ed. But, to u&s;e a Maxim of our Writer's, may not a Precept or two, &s;cattered in this light, epi&s;tolary Manner, have more Force than all the formal Documents that ever were penned? What has been, may be. I am a Witne&s;s that his Pupil,
<PB N="xvii" REF="15">
profited excellently by this Mode of In&s;truction; I therefore think the In&s;er|tion of them cannot be wholly u&s;e|le&s;s; be&s;ide that it gives an Opportunity of admiring that kind and ea&s;y Pliancy with which a Man of Learning and Ge|nius de&s;cended to the Level of a puerile Comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>I lament that it has not been in my Power to obtain a Sight of the young Lady's Letters. We have her Tutor's Word for her being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good Sen&s;e and a Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion. Her Remarks therefore could not but be en|tertaining, if not in&s;tructive; in-as-much as they came pure and genuine from the Heart, un&s;ophi&s;ticated with ca&s;ui&s;tical Rea&s;onings or Pedantry of Expre&s;&s;ion. He frequently mentions the Plea&s;ure her Letters afford him; unfortunately they are all wanting: &s;he had the Affliction to lo&s;e her Friend and In&s;tructor, when he was many Miles di&s;tant from her, and all Attempts to recover his Papers proved fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>To account for the endearing Terms in which the Tutor &s;ometimes addre&s;&s;es his Pupil, be it known he was her <HI>God-Father</HI>;
<PB N="xviii" REF="16">
and his unremitted Attention to the Im|provement of her Mind demon&s;trates how con&s;cientiou&s;ly he regarded that impor|tant Office he undertook at her Bapti&s;m, which is too often, by the Generality of Mankind, as iniquitou&s;ly neglected, as it incon&s;iderately a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>For the Gratification of &s;uch Readers, as wi&s;h to be more nearly acquainted with Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> I have prevailed on the Lady, to &s;ketch his Character, which I hereunto &s;ubjoin.</P>
<P>I have little more to &s;ay. I mean to give an u&s;eful Work to the Publick. Should I fail in my Judgment, my Inten|tion, at lea&s;t, is good; and however weak my Abilities may be, I have this com|fortable Reflection, that they are dedicated to a <HI>moral Purpo&s;e</HI>; to which Important End I wi&s;h that all my little Labours &s;hould conduce, as mo&s;t &s;uitable to my Inclination, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with my Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER To the EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>YOU a&s;k me for a Character of my rever'd Mr. <HI>P.</HI> You tell me I mu&s;t ha&s;ten, for that the Publication is in great forwardne&s;s. Alas, what a Ta&s;k have you given me! already have I &s;uffered extreme Pain on a Re-peru&s;al of his Let|ters, which, &s;ince his Death, I have never dared to look into, till you encouraged me, by &s;aying they might be of the &s;ame Service to others, which they had once been to me. Flattered by this Opinion, I ventured to read them again; all my Affection, all my Gratitude, all my Re&s;pect awakens; but all embittered by the Recollection of my Lo&s;s; he lives and dies to me again, on this Review of what I owe to him. I am now le&s;s equal to the Ta&s;k you require of me, than I was, when I fir&s;t delivered the Papers to your Hands. I then deferred writing
<PB N="xx" REF="18">
what you wi&s;hed, through a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Incapacity, and a Shame at delivering my Sentiments intentionally to the Pre&s;s. That Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that Shame, is now ab&s;orbed in my Fears for the &s;acred Re|putation of my beloved Teacher; what will an idle, a di&s;&s;ipated Public &s;ay of the&s;e valuable Letters? Should they be treated with Scorn, or even Di&s;re&s;pect, I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf. Is it not po&s;|&s;ible that Per&s;ons, without a Tythe of his Under&s;tanding, his Education, or his Virtue, will &s;et them&s;elves up for Con|demners of his Sen&s;e, his Literature, and his Morals? Have not I tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the Duty I for ever owe his Memory in run|ning &s;uch a Ri&s;que? My Motive mu&s;t be my Apology; and if the Departed know any thing of the Actions of Survivors, he will know I mean but to pur&s;ue his own Plan, of doing as exten&s;ive Good as my Power will let me. To that Public, who will &s;hortly receive them, I can only &s;ay, the favoured Individual, to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, owes all the little Merit, you, and her other partial Friends have ever a&s;cribed to her (under Heaven) to the Le&s;&s;ons &s;he received from the Au|thor of the&s;e Letters; naturally petulant
<PB N="xxi" REF="19">
capricious, ob&s;tinate, he knew, with happy Art, how to turn even her Failings to Account; and &s;killfully u&s;ed even the <HI>Curvings</HI> of her Temper as In&s;truments to the Improvement of her Mind. The Letters truly are, what you have an|nounced them, Genuine; the Writer was a Gentleman of an antient and honourable Family, once of affluent Fortunes; the Name, you have adopted in lieu of his own, indicates the Misfortune of his Life. He was accounted a Man of the fir&s;t Sen&s;e among Men of Sen&s;e; his Educa|tion was compleat, his Literature deep, yet poli&s;hed; his Ta&s;te nice, yet not <HI>cavillous</HI>; (if I may u&s;e the Word) his Wit was as &s;ound as his Judgment, and as &s;weet as his Man|ners; his Humour was infinite, and harmle&s;s as it was plea&s;ant. This was his Character from Men of Standard Judgment; for it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>I,</HI> at any Time, could be capable of un|der&s;tanding this Part of it, much le&s;s at Sixteen, at which Age I had the Unhappi|ne&s;s to lo&s;e him; but what I have repeat|ed is no more than I have heard of|ten a&s;&s;erted by Per&s;ons of e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|putation for Skill in what they &s;poke of; But his Heart&mdash;to de&s;cribe that, is <HI>properly</HI>
<PB N="xxii" REF="20">
my Province. Yet how &s;hall I be equal to it? Pious as a primitive Chri&s;tian, Chearful in the &s;ame Degree he was pious; Benevo|lent, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Sen&s;e of the Word; Beneficent, as far as a limited Power would let him; Mild in his Cen|&s;ures, Strict in his Actions, Charitable in Thought, Word, and Deed; Merciful even to an Infect; Kind not only in In|tention and Act, but his very Addre&s;s was Kindne&s;s pourtrayed; yet was he, to u&s;e his own Words, &s;peaking of Mrs. K. <Q>very re&s;entful, if he conceived him&s;elf &s;lighted.</Q> A &s;trong Trait of his Charac|ter was the Pliancy, with which he yielded to his fallen Fortunes, and the <HI>un</HI>-yielding Spirit with which he &s;upported an Indepen|dence, in de&s;pight of them. If it would not appear too fanciful I &s;hould &s;ay he united in his Temper the poetical De&s;crip|tions of the Ivy and the Oak. The Misfortune hinted at (owing to Educa|tion and the Principles of his Family early imbibed) in the youthful Part of his Life, depriving him of the Means of providing for a Family equal to their Birth and his Spirit, kept him a &s;ingle Man; my Father and him&s;elf, (involved

<P>MY la&s;t was by Thur&s;day's Po&s;t.

<P>Your Letters and Tran&s;lations give me great Plea&s;ure, there is &s;omething &s;o much of the French Turn in them.</P>
<P>They are only the mo&s;t common Things which you over&s;ee. You &s;pell

Engli&s;h as well as a Man of Learning does, and much better than the mo&s;t Part of your Sex. I would have you as per|fect at &s;pelling French. I don't expect that your Tran&s;lations &s;hould be equal to the Original. How can that be, when the Tran&s;lation that I &s;end you, and which you are to render again into the Original, is &s;o widely different from the Original it&s;elf? But then I would have you ob|&s;erve the Difference nicely, as it would make a la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion on your Mind. I would have you make &s;ome Paper up in different Folds; then write your own Phra&s;e on one Side, and the French Ori|ginal on the other, if the Difference is worth noticing; for in&s;tance, in this Manner:</P>

<P>Yours is not bad French, but then the other is better. If you'll take this Me|thod, it will infix the mo&s;t proper and elegant Expre&s;&s;ion deep in your Mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall detain you no longer, having many Letters to write.

<P>You &s;hould carefully remark the prin|cipal Differences between the French and Engli&s;h Manner of Speech.

In like Manner, the Difference is difficult between <HI>en</HI> and <HI>dans</HI>; when the Adverb <HI>ne</HI> is to be u&s;ed, and when not. We &s;ay, "He is richer than you think, &amp;c." The French &s;ay, "He is richer than you don't think." Then we have an auxiliary Verb, which they want, and which adds great Force and Energy to our Expre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome Occa&s;ions; and that is the Verb <HI>do.</HI> When we aver a

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 20th and &s;hewed it to your Mama, who was writing to you in the mean Time, but I &s;uppo&s;e her Letter don't reach you till this Night.</P>
<P>You certainly do not remark the Dif|ferences between the Original and your Tran&s;lation, or you would not fall &s;o often into Faults which are &s;o obvious. You frequently mix Sub&s;tantives and Ad|jectives of different Genders together, and Nouns and Verbs of different Num|bers. I have reproved you twice for that word <HI>mis,</HI> which you u&s;e both in
<PB N="29" REF="51">
the &s;ingular and plural Number, and yet you have it twice in the la&s;t Tran&s;la|tion.</P>
<P>I remarked to you formerly, that you u&s;ed the perfect Time, when the im|perfect was more proper; and if you had but compared the Original with your own Tran&s;lation, you would have found it, as I &s;aid. You are to ob&s;erve, as I told you before, when you &s;peak of a particular Thing done &s;ome time ago, you &s;hould u&s;e the perfect: but when you &s;peak of a Thing u&s;ually done, the imperfect. For Example:</P>
<P>"Elle mettoit l'Ordre dans la Mai&s;on du Roi." That is, &s;he <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to do it. But when it is only a peculiar Action done <HI>once</HI> or at a <HI>certain</HI> Time,</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="52">"Elle mit l'Ordre," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve al&s;o, that they do not u&s;e the Word <HI>avec</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in &s;o exten&s;ive a Sen&s;e, as we do <HI>with</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> What we tran&s;late into <HI>with</HI> is &s;ometimes &agrave;, &s;ometimes <HI>de</HI> in French.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the true Idiom of a Language is generally the la&s;t Point which is learned, and requires a greater Degree of Comprehen&s;ion than is nece&s;&s;ary for un|der&s;tanding a plain grammatical Rule, I hope this Pa&s;&s;age will not be deemed too trifling to have been retained. It is po&s;&s;ible that a young Mind might receive a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion from meeting a Rule thus in the Cour&s;e of a Letter, than in the formal Mode of In&s;truction.</NOTE> Remark too they &s;ay, <HI>La Cadette de ces deux,</HI> we &s;ay, "The younge&s;t of the three." The Sen&s;e is the &s;ame, though the Expre&s;&s;ion is &s;omewhat different; for <HI>Cadette</HI> &s;igni|fies properly, one that is younger. <HI>Le Cadet,</HI> for Example, is <HI>the younger Brother,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="53">
whereas <HI>Cadette</HI> in this Place, implies <HI>the Si&s;ter, who was younger than the other two.</HI></P>
<P>When they talk of any Thing that we learn they u&s;e <HI>&s;cavoir,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>pouvoir,</HI> as you may &s;ee in the Original, and it is worth your Ob&s;ervarion.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay but the Tran&s;lation has the <HI>true Spirit</HI> of French in it; for this rea&s;on, it vexes me to &s;ee you fail in the commone&s;t Things. I &s;hall not trouble you with a new Exerci&s;e till Saturday, that you may con&s;ider what I have re|marked in this and my fomer Letters, with Care and Diligence.</P>

<P>I Have the Plea&s;ure of yours of the 26th. I have not yet &s;een your Ma|ma; when I do, I &s;hall deliver her your Letter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not di&s;pute your Care; but there is a wide Difference between taking Care, and taking due Care. We may exerci&s;e a great deal, but if it is not rightly conducted, it may be very un|profitable. If you would &s;urvey your Verbs with Attention, you would not

I do not expect that you &s;hould fall upon the be&s;t Phra&s;es in the French Language; that is impo&s;&s;ible; but when you compare the Originals with your Tran&s;lations, you &s;hould do it with &s;o much Accuracy, as to im|print the French Phra&s;es and Idioms &s;trongly on your Mind. Remember what I wrote to you about the Exerci&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Character of <HI>Finette.</HI></NOTE> on the other Side; when you lay that and the Original together, you will have a good Opportunity to remark the dif|ferent U&s;e of the perfect and imperfect Ten&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="56">I have got <HI>Gil Blas</HI> to divert you when you return to Town: if you are very anxious to &s;ee it, and are to &s;tay &s;ome further Time in the Country, I will &s;end it by the Coach.</P>
<P>I was far from well when I wrote la&s;t, and rather wor&s;e on Sunday; but have been prevailed upon to take a Medicine, and am now much better.</P>
<P>They talk warmly of putting more Ships in Commi&s;&s;ion, and rai&s;ing additional Forces, as if there were to be an Inva|&s;ion, and the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender, French Tyranny and arbitrary Government, were all ready to bur&s;t in upon us,

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;till continue to u&s;e the &s;ingular Verb for the plural. Is not this Negligence in the highe&s;t Degree? The&s;e little Faults apart, the Tran&s;lation is ad|mirable, by far the be&s;t you ever made, and you improve in every one. I grant it is your Application to write fine French, that makes you neglect common Things; but then it looks ugly to &s;ee &s;uch good French defective in the very fir&s;t Princi|ples, that a Beginner would be a&s;hamed of. I do not think <HI>il cau&s;oit,</HI> for <HI>il fai&s;oit,</HI> good French. Pray ob&s;erve the Arange|ment of the Original, and compare it with your Tran&s;lation. You &s;ay, <HI>il fit

l'Infidelit&eacute; de cet Homme de retomber</HI>&mdash;They &s;ay, <HI>il fit retomber l'Infidelit&eacute;,</HI> &amp;c. Hence you may remark that they put as few Words as they can between the Infinitive and the Verb that governs it. After <HI>faire</HI> they never u&s;e the Particle; for Example, <HI>je le ferai entrer,</HI> and not <HI>d'entrer,</HI> or <HI>&agrave; en|trer.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, your Tran&s;lation charms me; and the Faults are but like a little Mole or two on a fine Face. I &s;hall give you but a very &s;hort Ta&s;k this Day.</P>
<P>I can promi&s;e you va&s;t Plea&s;ure in the reading of <HI>Gil Blas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is worth ob&s;erving how nicely Mr. Pre&s;ton &s;lides in another Author, and lays it before his Pu|pil as if with a View to her Amu&s;ement only.

<PB N="49" REF="71">
of old Philo&s;ophers, yet you cannot fail of finding many Things, which will be of va&s;t Advantage to you, if you duly ob&s;erve them.

<P>I would have you, my Dear, to read often the Proverbs of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the <HI>Eccle|&s;ia&s;tes, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus,</HI> and the <HI>Wi&s;dom of the Son of Sirach.</HI> There are few Books, which I know, fit to be compared

will be then no Danger but that you will find People who will love and e&s;teem you, nay, very probably, even pique them&s;elves on &s;erving you, and be proud to be thought your Friends and Bene|factors.</P>

<P>I Have your agreeable Letter of the 14th in&s;tant, and would have an&s;wer|ed it before, but that I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|gaged lately in a little Bu&s;ine&s;s, which has prevented my writing to you &s;o often as I intended.</P>
<P>You want to have long Letters from me; I want the &s;ame Thing from you. I wi&s;h you had been particular about your Vi&s;it to Mr. and Mrs. F&mdash;, and that you had let me know the Subject your Conver&s;ation turned upon. You don't tell me if Mr. W&mdash;has &s;ent the <HI>Arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="56" REF="78">
of Cambray</HI>'s Book, nor what you think of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s Maxims; but as you are deeply engaged in <HI>Homer,</HI> I can ea&s;ily excu&s;e that.</P>
<P>There are infinite Beauties in <HI>Homer</HI>; and though all Tran&s;lations mu&s;t, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, fall &s;hort of &s;o great an Original, yet I think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> pre|&s;erves the Life and Soul, and Fire of it, in a great Degree. There is not &s;uch a va&s;t Warmth and Ardour in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but then there is &s;uch a Beauty, and, I may &s;ay, Loveline&s;s in him, as pa&s;&s;es all De|&s;cription; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for the Heart of a Reader, who is ignorant of this Ori|ginal, to form any Manner of Idea of it. When you read <HI>Pope</HI>'s Tran&s;lation, you read &s;omething like <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf; but
<PB N="57" REF="79">
when you read <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> you can &s;carce have any Notion or Image of his genuine Excellencies. No Painter ever gave more fine and lively Expre&s;&s;ion to a Picture, or with more Exactne&s;s and Judgment, than <HI>Vir|gil</HI> gives to his De&s;criptions. Nay, if you &s;aw the Thing it&s;elf repre&s;ented be|fore you, it would &s;carcely make a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion. Yet I do not hereby pre&s;ume to aver that <HI>Dryden</HI> was a Poet inferior to <HI>Pope,</HI> but he was old, and not &agrave; <HI>&s;on Ai&s;e,</HI> when he tran&s;lated <HI>Virgil.</HI> A bet-Excu&s;e however may be brought for him; namely, that neither our Lan|guage, nor (to my Belief) any other Language in the World, can come up to the Beauty, Elegance and Energy of the matchle&s;s Original.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="80">Though no one can read <HI>Homer,</HI> who has any (though ever &s;o little) Elevation of Fancy, without being charmed with him, yet if we are let into his great De&s;ign, the Structure and Contrivance of his Fable, the Plot, Conduct, and Execution of the Whole, with what the Criticks call the Characters, the Sentiments, Dic|tion, Figures, De&s;criptions, &amp;c. I &s;ay, when the&s;e Things are duly known, we &s;hall have a much greater Plea&s;ure in read|ing him, than otherwi&s;e we can po&s;&s;i|bly attain.</P>
<P>If you will read <HI>Pope</HI>'s Introduction to the <HI>Iliad,</HI> with Care, it will prove of great U&s;e to you. You &s;hould al&s;o make your&s;elf acquainted with his Notes; but in order to have a ju&s;t Conception of this
<PB N="59" REF="81">
Stile of Writing. it is nece&s;&s;ary to pay great Attention to <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>'s Treati&s;e of Epick Poetry. It is commended as the mo&s;t judicious E&s;&s;ay on that Subject, that ever was written; and though it be of little U&s;e to us, till we are &s;omewhat acquainted with Epick Poetry, yet, once dipped into that excellent Way of Writing, it is of infinite Service to give us a true Ta&s;te for it. We &s;hould experience the Advantage of it, in a high Degree, through the <HI>Iliad,</HI> the <HI>Ody&s;|&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> Many other Epick Poems are written, which perhaps may as well be let alone as read. I except &s;ome pro&s;e Performances, &s;uch as <HI>Telemaque. Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s <HI>Jeru&s;alem de|livered</HI> has been recommended to me
<PB N="60" REF="82">
well worth reading: it was originally written in Italian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am apt to think Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> was not &s;ingular in having lived many Years ignorant of this beautiful Production. Within the &s;mall Circle of my Acquaintance, I have been amazed, on quoting <HI>Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to find &s;everal Per&s;ons of exqui&s;ite Ta&s;te, and Lovers of reading, utter Strangers to the very Name. It is &s;urely an ad|mirable Poem, and &s;hould be univer&s;ally known.</NOTE>. There is, however, I am told, an old Tran&s;lation of it into Engli&s;h, by <HI>Edward Fairfax,</HI> which I am going to read forthwith. A Friend, on who&s;e Ta&s;te and Judgment I can de|pend, a&s;&s;ures me it is an admirable Work, abounding with exqui&s;ite Poetry, and all the Spirit of an Original. <HI>Statius,</HI> who certainly had a great poetic Genius, wrote an Heroic Poem in Latin, called the <HI>Thebaid</HI>; but it falls &s;o infinitely &s;hort of <HI>Virgil</HI> in &s;ome Particulars, and
<PB N="61" REF="83">
perhaps in <HI>all</HI> (except in his Fire, of which <HI>Statius</HI> had a large Portion) that his Poem and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s are often oppo&s;ed to each other in <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> by way of contra&s;t; &s;o that you may there &s;ee clo&s;e and nice Examples of Judiciou&s;ne&s;s and Injudici|ou&s;ne&s;s, Beauties and Defects. It might be of great Advantage to you, to have <HI>Statius</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> before you, when you read <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> that you might immediately con&s;ult the Originals, when any remark|able Quotation is made. There is &s;ome Part of the <HI>Thebaid</HI> tran&s;lated by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but I do not know if the whole is rendered into Engli&s;h by any Hand. Now if you are inclined to read <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> I will &s;end it to you.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="84">There are &s;ome noble Beauties in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> which I have, with great Ac|curacy, ob&s;erved. Perhaps the chief of them may have been noticed by other People; however as they are <HI>my own,</HI> and not borrowed from, though they may re&s;emble, others, I flatter my&s;elf they may not be unwelcome to you.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>Homer.</HI> We are to con&s;ider in the fir&s;t Place, what was his De&s;ign or End in writing an He|roick Poem, ab&s;tracted entirely from the Tendency of the Work.</P>
<P>The End this Poet propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, perhaps, was to procure Prai&s;e, perhaps, Profit. The latter has been too often the Ca&s;e of Poets, and if the Tradition be
<PB N="63" REF="85">
true, that <HI>Homer</HI> was blind and poor, it might have been the &s;ame with him. <HI>Horace</HI> ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;es of him&s;elf,
<Q><L>Paupertas impulit audax</L>
<L>Ut Ver&s;us facerem&mdash;<HI>to wit,</HI></L>
<L>Poverty, which is impudent, compelled me</L>
<L>to write Ver&s;es.</L></Q>
Yet when we con&s;ider the Sublimity, and almo&s;t Divinity of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Writings, we are &s;urely tempted to think that he was not poor; if he was, how much is he to be admired and revered, who &s;corned to &s;toop to low di&s;graceful Subjects, by which, however, he might po&s;&s;ibly have obtained an ea&s;ier and more plentiful Sub&s;i&s;tence, than by producing &s;uch a laborious, &s;ublime and u&s;eful Work!</P>
<P>It is probable that the <HI>Aeneid</HI> was wrote with a De&s;ign to compliment <HI>Augu&s;tus
<PB N="64" REF="86">
Cae&s;ar,</HI> and procure his Favour. Allow|ing this, I cannot but think that <HI>Virgil</HI> plea&s;ed him&s;elf, at the &s;ame Time, with the Beauty and Loveline&s;s of the Charac|ters and De&s;criptions he gave us; and in the Reflection of having endeavoured to make Mankind better, by repre&s;enting the Excellence of Virtue, and Dete&s;tabi|lity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe this is a Word of Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s own Coining, but the Strength and Application of it appeared to me to carry the Apology with them. It cannot be objectionable, I pre&s;ume, to any but a Caviller. A liberal Judge &s;corns, on every flight Occa&s;ion, ta make a cold Appeal to a Dic|tionary. Not but, in my humble Opinion, the Word, though not to be found, is very ju&s;tifiable in grammatical Propriety. We have <HI>Placability,</HI> us well as <HI>placable,</HI> and why not <HI>Dete&s;tability,</HI> as well as <HI>dete&s;table?</HI> And are not &s;uch Liberties (&s;o long as they do not contradict Rea&s;on and Proba|bility) not only allowable, but Prai&s;e-worthy, in-as-much as they contribute to enlarge and en|rich our Language?</NOTE> of Vice, in their di&s;tinct Colours.</P>
<P>You perceive hereby that we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the End an Author
<PB N="65" REF="87">
propo&s;es to him&s;elf by his Work, and that which he propo&s;es to the World. The general De&s;ign and Tendency may be equally to amu&s;e and improve Mankind; the particular Tendency, to inculcate &s;ome u&s;eful Truth in the Minds of tho&s;e Per|&s;ons, for whom the Work was chiefly written.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> founds, his Subject on the Actions and Sufferings of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> from the De|&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> till he &s;ettled, a new Empire in <HI>Italy</HI>; and the Le&s;&s;on, to be deduced from it, &s;eems to be, the great Efficacy of a due Mixture of active and
<PB N="66" REF="88">
pa&s;&s;ive Virtues. His <HI>Aeneas</HI> is wi&s;e, ju&s;t, pious, valiant, good-natured, patient, and firm to his Purpo&s;e. The&s;e Virtues carry him, at la&s;t, through all his Diffi|culties; but his Patience and Piety, &s;eem mo&s;t important to him. This is nicely judicious in the Author, to make the Hero owe his Happine&s;s to his unre|pining Endurance of Hard&s;hips, his im|plicit Submi&s;&s;ion to the Will of Heaven, and his pious Affection for his Father, his Son, his Friends, and his People; hence he is beloved of them all; and we find, notwith&s;tanding his long Sufferings, he was the peculiar Care of Heaven.</P>
<P>Man is not a faultle&s;s Being. <HI>Virgil</HI> therefore did not chu&s;e to draw his Hero out of Nature. He has de&s;cribed him with the Imperfections of a human Be|ing.
<PB N="67" REF="89">
He is very culpable in his Behavi|our to <HI>Dido.</HI> This is his great Fault; but you &s;ee, the Author has judiciou&s;ly attributed that to him, which the greate&s;t of Men are liable to, and the be&s;t of Men &s;ometimes fall into. <HI>Aeneas</HI> how|ever acted not half &s;o bad a Part by <HI>Dido,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> did with re&s;pect to <HI>Bath&s;heba</HI> and <HI>Uriah</HI>; and yet you &s;ee, it co&s;t <HI>Aeneas</HI> very dear, and it was not without great Grief and Angui&s;h of Heart, that he ex|tricated him&s;elf at la&s;t. Suppo&s;ing the Story to be true, a Man of &s;o much Goodne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> mu&s;t have had many bitter Reflections, during the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, for his Be|haviour at <HI>Carthage,</HI> and the fatal Event which attended it.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Beauties, and various Incidents in the Fourth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> engaged me &s;o clo&s;ely, as to make me
<PB N="73" REF="95">
po&s;tpone what I &s;hould before have ob|&s;erved, namely the Tendency of this mo&s;t noble Poem. I now come to it.</P>
<P>Near the Beginning of the fir&s;t Book, <HI>Virgil</HI> makes this Reflection, "So great a Ta&s;k was it to found the Roman Em|pire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Tantae Molis erat Romanam condere Gentem;</Q> <P>So it runs in the Original, and in <HI>Dryden</HI>;</P> <Q><L>Such Time, &s;uch Toil requir'd the Roman Name,</L><L>Such Length of Labour for &s;o va&s;t a Frame.</L></Q></NOTE>." From which I am of Opinion that the immediate and particular De&s;ign of his Work was to imprint on the Minds of the <HI>Romans,</HI> his Countrymen, a great E&s;teem for them&s;elves, a pa&s;&s;io|nate Love for their Country, and a becom|ing
<PB N="74" REF="96">
Piety and Gratitude towards the Gods; tho&s;e Gods, who had fought for them, who had led them through &s;o many Dangers and Difficulties, and, after &s;uch &s;evere Encounters with other Nations, and even with &s;ome of the Deities them&s;elves who were Enemies to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> had, at la&s;t, &s;et|tled them in that fine Country of <HI>Italy,</HI> and from &s;mall Beginnings had enabled them to grow up to &s;uch a Height as per|haps the World had never &s;een before, nor ever &s;hall again.</P>
<P>If this was <HI>Virgil</HI>'s De&s;ign (and &s;urely it is very probable) how agreeable is it to what we find in holy Writ! <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q><PB N="75" REF="97">I have pa&s;&s;ed over this Brook with my Staff, and now I am become two Bands.</Q>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells the I&s;raelites, that they were the fewe&s;t of all People, and God had made them a mighty and a &s;trong Nation. This is in order to excite in them Gratitude and Piety. <HI>David,</HI> in a hundred Places, mentions the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, whereby, from a low and de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">picable E&s;tate, he was become great and mighty.</P>
<Q><P>I am poor and needy, but the Lord careth for me.</P>
<P>He teacheth my Hands to fight.</P>
<P>A Bow of Bra&s;s is broken by my Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="98">By my God I &s;hall leap over a Wall.</P>
<P>He &s;ubdueth the People under me.</P></Q>
<P><Q>As the Lord liveth, who hath re|deemed my Soul out of all Adver&s;ity.</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Virgil,</HI> when he wrote his <HI>Aeneid,</HI> &s;eems to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame Sentiments as tho&s;e of <HI>David, Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> It appears manife&s;tly &s;o by the Spirit, which runs through his whole Work.</P>
<P>We find him every where in love with Piety, Prudence, Patience, Con&s;tancy of Mind, Mode&s;ty, Humanity, Candour and in &s;hort with all that is prai&s;e-worthy. He has be&s;ide a Pa&s;&s;ion for the Belles-Let|tres,
<PB N="77" REF="99">
and Arts and Sciences, in general; and by his Maxims, recommends a &s;ober, indu&s;trious Life and Contentment with a little, rather than we &s;hould pro&s;titute our|&s;elves, and our Principles for Gain; &s;o that this noble Work is not only a fine Poem, but moreover a compleat Sy&s;tem of Morality.</P>
<P>Not only the Virtues above-mention|ed are recommended, and placed in a favourable Light, throughout the whole Work, but their contrary Vices are branded with Infamy and Dete&s;tation, al|ways hurtful, if not fatal to the Per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. The Author makes Virtue and Piety carry People through all Difficulties; that is, in mo&s;t In&s;tances, but he has peculiar Exceptions. He knew too much of the World and of Nature,
<PB N="78" REF="100">
to make it always &s;o. This would have been contradictory to Experience, and even his own Maxims; for he frequently gives us plain Intimations, that it often plea&s;es Providence to do, and bring about Things, which we cannot account for. You may remember, for In&s;tance, that at the Burning of <HI>Troy, Aeneas</HI> lo&s;t his wife, <HI>Creu&s;a,</HI> in the Confu&s;ion. He re|turned, and went again through all his Dangers, in que&s;t of her. At la&s;t, &s;he <HI>appears</HI> to him, and de&s;ires him to em|ploy no more Sollicitude about her, for he was never to &s;ee her again. She adds, that &s;uch Things do not happen but by the Will and Ordination of Heaven; in|timating that it was the great Mother of the Gods, who had detained her in tho&s;e Parts, purpo&s;ely that &s;he might not
<PB N="79" REF="101">
be en&s;laved by the Greeks. La&s;tly, &s;he recommends, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, their Son <HI>A&s;canius</HI> to his Care, the com|mon Pledge of their Love. Now, to a&s;k why a virtuous affectionate Cou|ple &s;hould be &s;o dreadfully &s;eparated, and why <HI>Creu&s;a</HI> &s;hould peri&s;h in <HI>Troy,</HI> who had not de&s;erved it by any Crime, were to a&s;k a pre&s;umptuous and an impious Que&s;|tion, allowing the Story to be true. It was undoubtedly to an&s;wer &s;ome great and better Purpo&s;e, intentionally con|cealed from our weak Judgments; and this is the Le&s;&s;on, which <HI>Virgil</HI> means to give us. <HI>Creu&s;a</HI>'s tender Concern for her Child is mo&s;t affectingly natural, and the Reality has been verified in the Deathbed Farewel of many worthy Wives.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="102">Will you permit me to digre&s;s one Moment, to mark to you a Beauty of this Kind in our great dramatic Bard, our <HI>Shake&s;peare?</HI> In the third Act of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> when the <HI>Gho&s;t</HI> appears to the Prince and his Mother in the Clo&s;et, "to whet his almo&s;t-blunted Purpo&s;e," he &s;udden|ly breaks from that, to a tender Con|cern and Compa&s;&s;ion for the Queen's Si|tuation,

<P>Whenever this Author makes virtuous Per&s;ons &s;uffer, it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould ob&s;erve, he makes them guilty of &s;ome Fault, which naturally brings on their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and it is to &s;uch Fault yon mu&s;t attribute them, ab&s;tractedly from their good Qualities.

an Exploit above his Years, and that without taking Leave of an affec|tionate Mother.

<P>By the&s;e Examples <HI>Virgil</HI> teaches us how dangerous it is to fail in a Point of Duty to Parents, albeit through the mere Frailty of our Nature, and nei|ther out of Contempt nor Stubbornne&s;s of Temper.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 23, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE infinite Beauties of <HI>Virgil</HI> have carried me &s;o much farther than I in|tended, that, if I can prevail upon my&s;elf, I &s;hall contract what I have to &s;ay further on this Subject into a narrow Compa&s;s; though there are &s;o many Charms in this glorious Poem, that I &s;carce know how to quit it.</P>
<P>To point out all the Excellencies of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it would be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the whole Poem. I will therefore only touch on &s;ome of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages
<PB N="85" REF="107">
which plea&s;e me mo&s;t, and are, what I judge, the chief Beauties.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Book, we may remark his meeting with his Mother under the Fi|gure of a Huntre&s;s, his going to <HI>Carthage,</HI> the Reception which the Queen gave him, and her becoming enamoured of him; and the Artifice which <HI>Venus</HI> u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Sinon,</HI> in the &s;econd Book, the Return of <HI>Aeneas</HI> to &s;eek his Wife, his Interview and Conver&s;ation with her Spirit, and the affectionate Care and Anxiety he te&s;tified for his Father, his Son and whole Family, are very affecting.</P>
<P>How &s;triking are his Adventures and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es through the whole third Book,
<PB N="86" REF="108">
but particularly his Encounter with <HI>He|lenus</HI> and <HI>Andromache!</HI> How natural was all that happened on that Event! The Story of <HI>Achaemenides,</HI> the <HI>Cyclopes,</HI> and the De&s;cription of <HI>Aetna!</HI></P>
<P>In the fourth Book, the whole Proce&s;s of the Loves of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Dido,</HI> with their fatal Con&s;equences, are beyond all Parallel, all Power of Imitation.</P>
<P>In the fifth, the funeral Games are in|troduced in Honour of <HI>Anchi&s;es,</HI> particu|larly the Mock-fight of the Children, called Ludus Trojanus. The&s;e are fol|lowed by the burning of the Ships and Behaviour of the Matrons.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="109">The whole &s;ixth Book is inexpre&s;&s;i|bly fine; his meeting with <HI>Dido,</HI> and their mutual Behaviour thereon; his encountering <HI>Deiphobus</HI> and his Father, and having the Gho&s;ts of his Po&s;terity &s;hewn him, are all mo&s;t awefully af|fecting. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> &s;eems to have imi|tated this la&s;t Circum&s;tance in his <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>How well does he de&s;cribe the Joys of Heaven and Hell, and what Sort of Inhabitants are to be found in each Place! The chief in Heaven are tho&s;e, who have &s;uffered Wounds and Death for their Country; Prie&s;ts who have lived a holy Life, becoming their Profe&s;&s;ion; and Bards who have written and sung in pious Strains, not unworthy of the
<PB N="88" REF="110">
Gods; intimating, that tho&s;e who pro&s;|titute &s;uch &s;ublime Talents to mean and vitious Purpo&s;es, de&s;erve nor the Care of Heaven. Next in Degree to the&s;e are Per&s;ons who have employed their Life in Arts and Inventions, for the Be|nefit of Mankind, and &s;uch as have di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by doing good.</P>
<P>In the other State, he allots the greate&s;t Share of Mi&s;ery to tho&s;e, who, when alive, hated their Brethren. Herein the Writer agrees exactly with what our <HI>Saviour</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Peter</HI> about forgiving his Brother, and what is likewi&s;e inculcat|ed in many other Parts of Scripture. St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q><PB N="89" REF="111">He that &s;ayeth he loveth God, and hateth his Brother, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</Q>
<P>We next behold tho&s;e who have re|jected their Parents, defrauded their De|pendants, and deceived &s;uch as confided in them; after which come tho&s;e who have &s;ate brooding over their Gold, and refu&s;ed to &s;hare it with the needy; tho&s;e who have &s;old their Country for mercenary Ends, have wre&s;ted the Laws, and de&s;troyed the Con&s;titution; and tho&s;e who have dared to be guilty of Adul|tery or Ince&s;t. To what noble Purpo&s;es, my dear Nancy, does this vi&s;ionary Scene conduce! How admirably has <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Fancy and Morality gone Hand in Hand!</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="112">Do you not admire that charming De|&s;cription, in the &s;eventh Book, of the different Nations who came as Allies to the War, which was impending? Their Behaviour, Habits, Arms, Cu&s;toms, how infinitely entertaining! and particularly, the charming Picture of <HI>Camilla,</HI> the fe|male Warrior, and her Troop of Ladies.</P>
<P>The great Events in the en&s;uing Part of the Work are, <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Vi&s;it to <HI>Evan|der,</HI> the Conver&s;ation and Con&s;equences, the &s;imple Way of Life pur&s;ued by that old Prince, the Story of <HI>Cacus,</HI> and that of <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> and <HI>Euryalus,</HI> the Prai&s;es of <HI>Her|cules,</HI> the Speeches of <HI>Turnus</HI> and <HI>Dran|ces,</HI> and the Deaths of <HI>Pallas, Camilla,</HI> and <HI>Lau&s;us.</HI> What noble Fire and Spi|rit does he di&s;play, when he de&s;cribes the
<PB N="91" REF="113">
Conflict between <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus!</HI> and how &s;ublime are the Sentiments of the latter, when he di&s;covers that he had been pur&s;uing a Spectre, in&s;tead of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and again, when he is about to expire. The&s;e, my dear Nancy, are &s;uch great and beautiful Pa&s;&s;ages, as ap|pear to ri&s;e in your E&s;timation, the more you con&s;ider, and the oftner you pe|ru&s;e them.</P>
<P>It is worth your while al&s;o to ob&s;erve how humane a Man, and how fine a Gen|tleman, <HI>Virgil</HI> appears throughout his whole Work. With what Plea&s;ure does he dwell on In&s;tances of Piety, pater|nal Love, filial Duty, conjugal Affec|tion, Humanity, Ho&s;pitality, and every &s;ocial Virtue! With what apparent De|light
<PB N="92" REF="114">
does he &s;peak of a lovely Child, or a promi&s;ing Youth! We &s;ee In&s;tances of this in his <HI>A&s;canius, A&s;tyanax, Eurya|lus, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Lau&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;eems to de&s;cribe, with no le&s;s Par|ticipation of Joy, Examples of fond ten|der Parents, in <HI>Aeneas, Evander, Creu&s;a Andromache, Amata,</HI> and the Mother of <HI>Euryalus.</HI> He in&s;tructs us in the Know|ledge of human Nature, (wherein he was deeply &s;killed) by painting the Love and Concern for a worthy Son, in the &s;avage and impious Mind of <HI>Mezentius.</HI> We may hence derive &s;ome very important Truths and Le&s;&s;ons. We learn fir&s;t that Love to our Children is &s;o inherent, that Per&s;ons who acknowledge no other Claim, who feel no other Call of Na|ture,
<PB N="93" REF="115">
and who are actually guilty of great Faults, in other Re&s;pects, &s;till pre|&s;erve their Duty and Affection here. We learn be&s;ide that Worth and Goodne&s;s will always be beloved and admired, and extort &s;ome Degree of Approbation, even from the mo&s;t unfeeling Heart. Had the Son of <HI>Mezentius</HI> been le&s;s de|&s;erving, probably his Father would not have mourned his Lo&s;s to &s;uch Exce&s;s; <HI>Aeneas</HI> not &s;o &s;trongly regretted having killed him; nor would <HI>Virgil</HI> have be|wailed him in &s;uch Terms, as (to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Horace</HI>) "were worth his dying for." He lo&s;t his Life through his Exce&s;s of Virtue; he was alarmed with Grief and Fear at Sight of his Fa|ther's Danger, ru&s;hed between him and <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and pre&s;erved his Parent. By
<PB N="94" REF="116">
this we are taught another u&s;eful Truth; namely, that no Fault of a Parent can &s;uper&s;ede the Duty of a Child. He might have e&s;caped, after he had pre&s;erved his Father; but Ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;o incident to Youth, drove him to venture beyond his Strength. <HI>Aeneas</HI> fore-warned him; he was deaf to this humane Advice, and his Death was the natural Con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>How finely natural is the Interview between <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> the Wi|dow of <HI>Hector</HI> and Mother of <HI>A&s;tyanax!</HI> It is worth your while to place them plainly and exactly before you. She weeps; he &s;tands amazed, and can hard|ly <HI>hi&s;s</HI> out (&s;uch is the literal Meaning of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion) a few Words.
<PB N="95" REF="117">
When &s;he has Power of Utterance, &s;he expatiates on many Subjects at once; &s;he relates the Story of her Life &s;ince the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> then enquires of his; then que&s;tions him about his Son, if he was not a promi&s;ing Youth, if he did not copy after him and his Uncle <HI>Hec|tor?</HI> and if he did not take to Heart the Death of his Mother? At parting from <HI>Aeneas,</HI> &s;he takes Leave of <HI>A&s;ca|nius</HI>; &s;he calls him the very Picture of her poor <HI>A&s;tyanax:</HI> &s;he di&s;covers the &s;ame Countenance, Eyes, and Hands, and that, had he happily &s;urvived, he would have been of the &s;ame Growth. This is the very Strength and Beauty of Nature, who&s;e Workings and Effects are the &s;ame in all Degrees of Life. Our Stations may be different, but our Feel|ings are alike.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="118"><HI>Virgil</HI> not only dwells upon the Duty of Children to their Parents, but even to their Nur&s;es, to tho&s;e who have had the Care of their Infancy. He recommends this, and exalts the Character of his Hero, at the &s;ame Time. That Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> where the Nur&s;e of <HI>Aeneas</HI> was buried, was called after her Name, and the pious Hero be&s;towed on her an honourable Funeral.</P>
<P>How plea&s;ing is the De&s;cription of <HI>Anna</HI>'s Nur&s;e (whom <HI>Dido</HI> treated with the &s;ame Tenderne&s;s as &s;he would her own, who was decea&s;ed) with an Intent and bu&s;y Air labouring to execute the Queen's Orders; <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion is "Studio anili;" that is, with that Cau|tion
<PB N="97" REF="119">
and Concern, &s;o peculiar to her Age and Office.</P>
<P>Our Author appears al&s;o as partially fond of his old Men, who are good and pious; his <HI>Priam, Anchi&s;es, Evander,</HI> and <HI>Butes. Priam</HI> is the fir&s;t Man to encourage <HI>Sinon,</HI> and <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> is the &s;ame to <HI>Achaemenides.</HI> You &s;ee the Care and Attention which the Tutor of <HI>A&s;canius</HI> &s;hews his Pupil. Thus <HI>Virgil</HI> paints Mankind in every Stage and Station of Life, and in all with equal Propriety: his Judgment never fails him.</P>
<P>I had forgot to recommend two very fine Pa&s;&s;ages; the Meeting between <HI>Alecto</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> and the Story of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Shield, made by <HI>Vulcan.</HI> Had I

<SALUTE>My dear Angel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 23d in&s;tant; it gave me more Plea&s;ure than I can expre&s;s. Your Sentiments of particular Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;o far as you have read, are ju&s;t and fine, and I de&s;ire you will give me your Thoughts on all the Remainder, as you proceed. <HI>Homer</HI> cer|tainly &s;trikes us more than <HI>Virgil,</HI> at fir&s;t. He &s;urpa&s;&s;es almo&s;t all Writers in Loftine&s;s, in Strength, in Fire, and in a boundle&s;s Fancy. But more of this at Length, when we come to have him before us, and make him our
<PB N="100" REF="122">
mutual Topic; though, in Truth, you have prevented a good deal of what I &s;hould have had to &s;ay on him, and will continue &s;o to do, as you go on. I will now conclude my Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and that in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> makes his Hero not only do hu|mane Offices to his Friends, his Rela|tions, and to his Nur&s;e, but even to his Servants. His Care of the Funerals of <HI>Mi&s;enus</HI> his Trumpeter, and <HI>Palinurus</HI> his Pilot, are In&s;tances of this.</P>
<P>When he de&s;cribes a funeral Pomp, a Sacrifice, the Admi&s;&s;ion of an Amba&s;|&s;ador, the Con&s;ecration of a Trophy, the Celebration of a Fe&s;tival, the Solem|nities
<PB N="101" REF="123">
at declaring War, or concluding Peace, or any Ceremonial what&s;oever, it is not only mo&s;t beautifully delivered, but we may be a&s;&s;ured, he lets us, at the &s;ame time, into the exact Manners and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Romans,</HI> on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, &s;o that Delight and In&s;truction go Hand in Hand.</P>
<P>Not only every word in <HI>Virgil</HI> is a Jewel, but they are all &s;o put together, that every Sentence may be &s;aid to repre|&s;ent a String of Jewels &s;et to the be&s;t Ad|vantage, and the whole <HI>Aeneid</HI> is &s;o com|pact, one Part &s;o connected with another, that they tend to illu&s;trate each other in the mo&s;t &s;triking Colours, and follow in &s;uch natural Order and Proce&s;s, as renders
<PB N="102" REF="124">
the whole Work beautiful, and places it in the mo&s;t becoming Point of Sight.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that <HI>Virgil</HI> never u&s;es an idle Word. Although there are &s;ome things, the Purpo&s;e whereof we do not perceive, at a fir&s;t reading, yet on nearer ob&s;ervation, before, or by the Time we reach the End of the Poem, we plainly di&s;cover it. I'll give you an In&s;tance of this fine Addre&s;s in <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>He makes his Hero not only the greate&s;t Character in his Work, but al&s;o the mo&s;t beautiful and virtuous. This is the Rever&s;e of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Proceeding, who &s;eems to make <HI>Hector</HI>'s Character the mo&s;t lovely of his Heroes; (and perhaps both Poets were in the Right, as I &s;hall here|after
<PB N="103" REF="125">
endeavour to make appear, when we come to compare Notes on the Greek) <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes <HI>Turnus</HI> fierce and haughty; when he kills <HI>Pallas,</HI> he does it with Plea&s;ure; he in&s;ults over him, and di&s;patches a cruel Me&s;&s;age to his Father. He indeed &s;ends back the Body (for this Author &s;eems re&s;olved not to make <HI>Turnus</HI> &s;o &s;avage as <HI>Achilles</HI>) but &s;poils him of his Armour, and puts it on him&s;elf, together with the gorgeous Belt, which <HI>Pallas</HI> wore. Now we &s;hould be apt to &s;uppo&s;e, at this parti|cular Cri&s;is, that there was nothing more implied herein, than that it was cu&s;tomary for great Warriors to wear the Arms of Adver&s;aries, whom they had &s;ubdued. But we find afterwards
<PB N="104" REF="126">
that <HI>Virgil</HI> had a particular U&s;e to make of this Belt, which he had &s;o e&s;pecially mentioned. <HI>Turnus</HI> puts it on, and wears it in Triumph; whereon the Poet makes a u&s;eful Reflection, and, at the &s;ame time, gives us a Hint of what will fol|low. "The Mind of Man," &s;ays he, <Q>elated with Pro&s;perity, is incapable of behaving with Moderation, and blind to Futurity. The Time will come when <HI>Turnus</HI> will &s;orely regret that ever he a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Pallas.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I will break off here, le&s;t my Letter &s;hould be too long, and give you one more on this Subject.</P>
<P>The Lines, you have quoted,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"As when the Moon, refulgent Lamp of Night," &amp;c. l. 687 to l. 698.</NOTE> are in my Opinion the mo&s;t beautiful in the
<PB N="105" REF="127">
whole <HI>Iliad.</HI> If you remember, one Night as we were coming through the Park, after I had repeated to you <HI>Milton</HI>'s De&s;cription of a fine Evening, I endea|voured to give you tho&s;e, but could not recollect them all.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter of the 27th came &s;afe to my Hand on the 29th. I really cannot tell you particularly when I &s;hall be in Town; but believe it will be &s;ome Time this Month. My comings depends on the Receipt of &s;ome Letters from <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128">As you intend to read the <HI>Aeneid</HI> again, there are many things, that I &s;hall pa&s;s over, becau&s;e I would not fore&s;tall the Plea&s;ure you are to have, if you read it with due Attention, I &s;hall only fini&s;h the Remark I began about <HI>Pallas</HI>'s Belt.</P>
<P>When <HI>Aeneas</HI> vanqui&s;hes <HI>Turnus,</HI> at the latter Part of the Poem, <HI>Turnus</HI> &s;ues for his Life. Now it was not pro|per to grant it; and the Nicety was, how to make <HI>Aeneas,</HI> who was &s;o famous for Humanity, and a merciful Di&s;po&s;ition, not comply with the Reque&s;t, and yet pre&s;erve his own Character. Behold this very Belt is made u&s;e of, which natu|rally and critically meets his Eye at the very In&s;tant when his Anger begins to relent and his Heart to melt. He imme|diately fires, with fre&s;h Re&s;entment, on
<PB N="107" REF="129">
recollection of the cruel In&s;ults which <HI>Turnus</HI> was guilty of, when he flew <HI>Pal|las.</HI> Hence a noble Indignation, Re&s;ent|ment, and even Compa&s;&s;ion for the Fate of <HI>Pallas</HI> occa&s;ions the Death of <HI>Turnus</HI>; and thus the Poet, by a beautiful Stroke of Fancy, makes that great Event the Re|&s;ult of Friend&s;hip and Pity, which otherwi&s;e had been an Act of Cruelty. We learn al&s;o, from the In&s;tance before us, this fine Le&s;&s;on, "That what People are mo&s;t proud and vain of, is often the Occa&s;ion of their Ruin." There is a noble Reflection to this Purpo&s;e at the End of the tenth Satire of Juvenal. All that I have further to &s;ay about the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is, to point out to you &s;ome charming Compari&s;ons, and then I have done with it. This I &s;hall do in my next

<P>I would have you, my dear, look in|to the Lives of the ancient Philo&s;ophers; and particularly regard their Ob&s;ervations made on Life; they will be of great U&s;e to you.</P>
<P>You do not tell me what you think of the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucault's</HI> Maxims, and Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I am now going through Ovid's Meta|morpho&s;es anew, and the more I read, the more I am charmed with it. I won|der you do not proceed in that Work. No Man &s;urely had ever &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o natu|ral, &s;o charming a Manner of telling a Story. You love Novels. <HI>Ovid</HI> has an

<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> pur&s;uing <HI>Turnus,</HI> and not being able to overtake him, is aptly likened to a Hound pur&s;uing a Deer; and this is &s;o lively a Repre&s;entation to one who has &s;een &s;uch a Chace, as nothing can &s;ur|pa&s;s. &rindx; Again <HI>Turnus,</HI> in his Engagement with <HI>Aeneas,</HI> when confounded with Fear and the bad Omens he had met with, and per&s;uaded the Gods were again&s;t him, fights indeed, but in &s;uch a Manner, as one imagines one does in a Dream.

&s;leep, we are free from Guilt, but that Sleep mo&s;t naturally dwells with inno|cent and undi&s;turbed Minds.</P>

<Q><L>As when the fleecy Flocks un-number'd &s;tand</L>
<L>In wealthy Folds, and wait the Milker's Hand,</L>
<L>The hollow Vales ince&s;&s;ant Bleating fills,</L>
<L>The Lambs reply from all the neighb'ring Hills.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd is at Line 516:
<Q><L>As Torrents roll, increas'd by num'rous Rills,</L>
<L>With Rage impetuous down their echoing Hills,</L>
<L>Ru&s;h to the Vales, and, pour'd along the Plain,</L>
<L>Roar thro' a thou&s;and Channels to the Main;</L>
<L>The di&s;tant Shepherd trembling hears the Sound,</L>
<L>So mix both Ho&s;ts, and &s;o their Cries rebound.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="162">The&s;e are two fine Compari&s;ons, and at the &s;ame Time, are noble De&s;criptions. I the rather quote them to you, becau&s;e you might po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;s them over, with|out regarding them &s;o much, as you never &s;aw the Originals, of which the&s;e De|&s;criptions are a Picture; but if you had &s;een them, as I have often done (being born and bred up all my younger Days in a very mountainous Country) you would own that nothing can be more natural or beautiful.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand the fir&s;t Compari&s;on rightly, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know that when the Lambs arrive at a certain Age, they are weaned, and put in a &s;eparate Flock by them&s;elves. The Ewes are put in Folds to be milked. That reci|procal
<PB N="141" REF="163">
De&s;ire which the Ewes and Lambs have to be together, makes them bleat ince&s;&s;antly, and, when within hearing, they regularly an&s;wer each other; tho&s;e Sounds the Hills-echo back, and fill the whole Valleys, or Glens (as we call them in <HI>Scotland)</HI> with a very agreeable Noi&s;e, even Mu&s;ick is &s;carcely more agreeable; at lea&s;t, to me.</P>
<P>How exceedingly fine is the De&s;cription of Di&s;cord, Line 503,
<Q>Small at her Birth and ri&s;ing every Hour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is very judiciou&s;ly placed where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Grecians and Trojans, who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">early reconciled, di&s;&s;ent again.

<Q>The Beginning of Strife is like the letting in of Water;</Q>

that is, a Gnat's Wing&mdash;intimating how &s;mall a Circum&s;tance, how worthle&s;s and incon&s;iderable, may occa&s;ion much Con|tention and great Mi&s;chief.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD a Letter from you by ye&s;terday's Po&s;t, which gave me great Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="166">I &s;hould now begin to explain to you the Nature of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and the <HI>Aeneid</HI>; but I do not know if you have yet made any Progre&s;s in the admi|rable Treati&s;e on Epick Poetry, by <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Bo&s;&s;u.</HI> If you have read, and mark|ed him attentively, I could omit many Things, as needle&s;s, and yet write a great deal more, that you would under|&s;tand and be plea&s;ed with. But this would not be proper, before you have read that compleat Treati&s;e, which un|folds the whole Art and My&s;tery of the Epick Poem.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> I think, &s;ays, that the <HI>Iliad</HI> points out the Effects of Anger; the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> tho&s;e of Patience and Wi&s;dom. The Effects of Anger and Re&s;entment, are
<PB N="145" REF="167">
ra&s;h, mad, and fooli&s;h Actions, tending to Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction. The Effects of Patience and long Suffering are well-advi&s;ed Actions, terminating in the Ac|compli&s;hment of our Wi&s;hes and leading to Happine&s;s. <HI>Horace,</HI> who knew Man|kind as well, perhaps, as any Man, who lived before or &s;ince his Time, (except &s;ome few whom we meet in the Holy Writings) &s;ays, that "He who violent|ly ha&s;tens his Revenge, renders the very End he would attain, ineffectual." The <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> are two great Examples of the Truth of this. In the former we &s;ee the Rage and Re&s;entment of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> fru&s;trate the very De&s;ign, for which they came to <HI>Troy;</HI> to wit, the De&s;truction of the Town. What Mi&s;eries did they not occa&s;ion? What lo&s;s of gallant Men? And <HI>Achilles,</HI> who
<PB N="146" REF="168">
even got the better in the Conte&s;t between him and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> paid dear for it in the Lo&s;s of his beloved <HI>Patroclus.</HI> What though he had the Satifaction, or rather Triumph, of killing <HI>Hector,</HI> (a much wor|thier Man than him&s;elf) yet that did not remove his Grief and Mi&s;ery; for, after that, we &s;till find him in the Agonies of Sorrow; &s;o true is it, that even when our blind and mad De&s;ires are granted, we find our&s;elves as far from Happine&s;s as we were before. Again, what did the Satisfaction of killing <HI>Hector</HI> co&s;t him? In the fir&s;t Place, we &s;ee he was forced to forego the &s;avage Plea&s;ure, he took in abu&s;ing the Body of that illu|&s;trious Chief; in &s;pite of his Teeth, as we &s;ay, <HI>Jove</HI> compelled him to forego it. He was even obliged to do honour to the
<PB N="147" REF="169">
Corp&s;e. Furthermore we find his own Fate was attached to that of <HI>Hector. Hector</HI> told him, at his Death, <Q>the Gods would not let his Death pa&s;s unreven|ged.</Q> <HI>Apollo</HI> accordingly met <HI>Achilles</HI> at the <HI>Scean</HI> Gate, and revenged it home; and, to his utter Di&s;grace, made him fall at la&s;t by a far le&s;s worthy Hand than that of <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall take Notice of this Particular more at length, in &s;ome following Let|ter. All I &s;hall add at pre&s;ent, is, that it is true we have not &s;uch Thunder and Lightning, &s;o great an Eclat, &s;uch bold Characters, &s;uch Force, &s;uch Grandeur and Maje&s;ty in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> as in the <HI>Iliad;</HI> yet the <HI>Arch-bi&s;hop of Cambray</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Antients, (at lea&s;t the be&s;t Judges and Criticks of Antiquity) do not give
<PB N="148" REF="170">
the <HI>Iliad</HI> the Preference. I &s;hall not re|peat what he &s;ays on that Head, but re|fer you to his own Words; they are in the <HI>Dialogues des Morts.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YE&s;terday's Po&s;t brought me yours of the 9th, in which your Hurry makes you leave out &s;ome Words, and mi&s;place others; this I wi&s;h you to guard again&s;t. It is a Neglect unworthy of you.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="171">Before you proceed in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> I mu&s;t beg you to read <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;ome Chap|ters in the Beginning of his admirable Treati&s;e. They will give you a proper Idea of the Nature and Plan of this, and every other Heroick Poem. There is al&s;o a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e on Epick Poetry prefixed to the la&s;t Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation of <HI>Telemaque,</HI> which is well worth your Attention; though I cannot agree with the Writer in preferring <HI>Telemaque</HI> to <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>I do not recommend the&s;e Books, in order to make you a nice Critick, but to enable you to read &s;uch Works as the <HI>Iliad, Ody&s;&s;ey, Aeneid, Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> and <HI>Tele|machus,</HI> with greater Plea&s;ure and Profit. You may add to the Li&s;t, <HI>To&s;&s;o</HI>'s <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="172">
which I have ju&s;t fini&s;hed (a fine Poem indeed, and admirably tran&s;lated) and <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI>'s <HI>Travels of Cyrus,</HI> about which we will talk when I come to Town.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other Works, &s;ome of which you have, that will be of great Service towards forming a true Idea of tho&s;e noble Authors, and likewi&s;e of all other kinds of Poetry; &s;uch as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry, Ro&s;common on Tran&s;lated Ver&s;e, Horace, Vida,</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Buck|kingham</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry, Rapin</HI>'s and <HI>Da|cier</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es on Eloquence and Poetry, Dryden</HI>'s and <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es, Pope</HI>'s <HI>Art of Critici&s;m,</HI> the mo&s;t excellent <HI>Arch|bi&s;hop of Cambray</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e on Eloquence,</HI> and the <HI>Spectators on Milton. Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Letter on Humour</HI> is al&s;o mo&s;t excellent and
<PB N="151" REF="173">
judicious, &s;o are <HI>Dr. Trapp</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es on Virgil.</HI> The&s;e Writings will give you a true Notion of Tragedy, Comedy, Satire, Pa&s;toral, Ode, Elegy, and Song, as well as of Epick Poetry; which la&s;t indeed, together with Tragedy and Comedy, are the three great Species of Poetry.</P>
<P>I will now &s;uppo&s;e that you have formed, or procured, a right Notion of the Nature of an Heroick Poem, and of the Action; that it mu&s;t be one great, in|tire, marvelous, but not incredible Piece; of a ju&s;t Length, in&s;tructive and enter|taining; I will pre&s;ume likewi&s;e that you have a Notion of the Characters, Man|ners, Sentiment and Diction, and of the ornamental Aid of Figures, Epi&s;odes, De&s;criptions, and Similes or Compari&s;ons,
<PB N="152" REF="174">
by which tho&s;e Characters and Manners are &s;et off to Advantage.</P>
<P>This being all pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, let us en|quire what <HI>Homer</HI> propo&s;es to do in his two matchle&s;s Poems, and then examine the End and Tendency of that Propo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>We will begin with the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays, that the Subject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the &s;horte&s;t, that ever was undertaken, name|ly, the Anger of <HI>Achilles.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> if I am not mi&s;taken, &s;ays that <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Propo&s;ition or Subject, is far preferable to the former. The one is the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> the other is the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a noble Empire, the noble&s;t, perhaps, that the World ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="175">Now I cannot agree altogether either with <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Dryden;</HI> for, in the fir&s;t In|&s;tance, it is not the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;im|ply con&s;idered, that <HI>Homer</HI> propo&s;es for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Poem, but the Delays, Di&s;appointments, and Calamities, which attended the Greeks in Con&s;equence of the Anger and Re&s;entment of <HI>Achilles.</HI> This is the Plan which he lays down, and on which he promi&s;es to proceed; and the particular Moral, that naturally ari&s;es from it, is the mo&s;t proper and u&s;eful that could be offered to his Coun|trymen. The Grecians were compo&s;ed of many little States; it was therefore their Intere&s;t to be unanimous, and clo&s;ely united, when engaged in a common Cau&s;e. How apt then was his Moral! He wi&s;hed them to learn that their Safety
<PB N="154" REF="176">
con&s;i&s;ted in their Union, and that Di&s;|cord and Di&s;&s;en&s;ion would be their Ruin; this was in the Cour&s;e of Time, actually verified. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> overthrew and en&s;laved them; and the Means he pur&s;ued to bring it about, was fir&s;t by &s;owing Di&s;&s;en&s;ion among them, and di|viding one State from the other. So divided, he found them an ea&s;y Con|que&s;t. The &s;ame Thing has happened a thou&s;and Times &s;ince, not only in &s;ove|reign States and Kingdoms, but even in private Families. One of our Saviour's Tenets, is, <Q>A Kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand;</Q> and this is the grand Moral, which ari&s;es out of the particular Subject of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, if we con&s;ider the Tendency of the Poem, I do not &s;ee but
<PB N="155" REF="177">
it may be deemed of as great Con&s;equence as that of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> though it may not be &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly agreeable. The Tendency of the one is to &s;hew by what Means, De|grees, and worthy Qualities, a mighty Empire was founded: The Tendency of the other, to point out the Mi&s;conduct, the Vices, and Follies, by which a great Undertaking was almo&s;t ruined (and in|deed had been entirely &s;o, but for an ex|traordinary Accident) and the whole Force of <HI>Greece</HI> overpowered. This la&s;t is &s;urely as u&s;eful a Le&s;&s;on as the fir&s;t; and &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable in <HI>Homer,</HI> in-as-much as he propo&s;ed to write another Poem, wherein he was to demon&s;trate the great and good Effects of Virtue; for &s;uch is the Purport of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="178">I think it is Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who &s;ays that, be&s;ide the grand particular Moral, that ari&s;es out of an Epick Poem, or that which the Poet had chiefly in view, there are many others, which con|tingently re&s;ult from the Fable. This is certainly true; it appears manife&s;tly in <HI>Homer</HI>; and perhaps it was as much his Intention to &s;hew the&s;e, as the great Mo|ral above-mentioned. In my en&s;uing Letters I will occa&s;ionally mark out &s;ome of the&s;e, and de&s;cribe what I conjecture to be the greatuniver&s;al Intention of the Author. At pre&s;ent, I fear I haved tired you, &s;o &s;hall trouble you no more for two or three Days.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;ome few Remarks to make in this Letter, on the Sixth Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> but they are very few. <HI>Pope</HI> has given us &s;o many fine Ob&s;ervations, that little is left for any other Pen.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY ye&s;terday's Po&s;t, I received yours of the 14th, but cannot much com|mend the Writing. I do not de&s;ire you to write me, when you are in &s;o very great a Hurry; rather put it off, till you have more Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with a long Letter of Particulars at pre&s;ent, but give you my Opinion of the <HI>Iliad</HI> in general.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the great Moral thereof, there are many other Things which the Con|duct of the Poem was meant to &s;et forth.
<PB N="163" REF="185">
We are &s;hewn the ill Effects of unlaw|ful Love, vain Glory, Pride, Inju&s;tice, Breach of Faith, Di&s;&s;imulation, Cowar|dice, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for In&s;tance, in <HI>Paris, Agamemnon, A&s;ius, Pandarus, Do|lon,</HI> and many others. Hence as the <HI>particular</HI> Intent of this wonderful Poem, is to &s;hew the fatal Con&s;equences of Di&s;|&s;en&s;ion and Anger among Princes, &s;o the main and general De&s;ign &s;eems cal|culated to point out the bad Effects of ungoverned Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites in all Mankind; to &s;et forth, that our giving way to them leads into Sin, that one Sin leads into another, and the whole into Mi&s;ery and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The great Moral ari&s;ing from it, is, (to give it you in the Greek)
<Q><PB N="164" REF="186"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
that is to &s;ay, "So the Coun&s;el of the Gods was perfected, or fulfilled." This is the very Beginning of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has tran&s;lated it,
<Q>Such was the &s;ov'reign Will, and &s;uch the Deom of <HI>Jove.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Homer</HI> is much &s;horter, more &s;im|ple, and &s;ublime; for <GAP DESC="foreign"> does not only &s;ignify <HI>Will,</HI> but <HI>Coun&s;el,</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e Deter|mination</HI>; hereby teaching us that Mi&s;ery is the Con&s;equence of ill-governed Pa&s;|&s;ions; and according to the &s;tated Nature of Things, it mu&s;t be &s;o. How agree|able is this to the Spirit of the &s;acred Scriptures, where it is &s;aid,</P>
<Q><PB N="165" REF="187">The Coun&s;el of the Lord endureth for ever, but the Coun&s;el of the wicked &s;hall be brought to nought.</Q>
<P>I was very well plea&s;ed the other Day when I found the above Sentence called, in <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes, the <HI>grand Moral</HI> of the Poem; for, in Truth, though I had al|ways thought &s;o, I did not know that any one had &s;aid it.</P>

<P><PB N="166" REF="188"><HI>Homer</HI> &s;hews us there is a nece&s;&s;ary natural Connection between giving way to our inordinate Appetites and Affec|tions, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing our Duty to God and Man; and thence a con&s;equential Tendency to Mi&s;ery and Puni&s;hment. It is in this Sen&s;e that one of the minor Prophets fays, "Is there Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?" teaching us thereby that no Mi&s;chief or Evil befalls an impious City or People, but what happens by the wi&s;e Coun&s;el and Will of God.</P>
<P>There are two Ways, whereby the great Author of the <HI>Iliad</HI> &s;hews us the Connection between Mi&s;ery and Sin, and between Sin and inordinate Affections. The one is, the natural Connection we
<PB N="167" REF="189">
have before ob&s;erved; the other, the immediate Vengeance of God proceed|ing from his Di&s;plea&s;ure.

<PB N="168" REF="190">
I need not &s;ay more on this Head, only refer to the Pa&s;&s;ages; and indeed many other Poets, as well as <HI>Homer,</HI> abound with Examples of this Kind.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be pointed out, my dear, is, how admirably the Greek Poet has made inordinate Affections be|get Offences to God, and Injuries to Man; and how naturally and clearly he has made Mi&s;eries and Puni&s;hments ari&s;e out of the former. But I will not de|tain you longer now, than to with you Health and Happine&s;s; and that you may improve the&s;e Things, not le&s;s to your Advantage, than to your Plea&s;ure.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote you on Friday the 17th, and thought I might po&s;&s;ibly hear from you on Sunday, but perhaps my Letter did not come Time enough to your Hand.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has ob&s;erved, that, through the <HI>Iliad, Homer</HI> has, in a Manner, made every thing done by Divine Providence. Some Deity always a&s;&s;i&s;ts the Hero who gets the better, except <HI>Ajax</HI> alone. When <HI>Hector</HI> breaks through the Grecian Wall, and &s;ets fire to their Ships, <HI>Jupiter</HI> a&s;|&s;i&s;ts him. When he is killed, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="192">
has abandoned him, and <HI>Pallas</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts <HI>Achilles.</HI> In a Word, in all Encoun|ters, and in all Actions, where any Point is to be gained by Valour, Cou|rage, or Wi&s;dom, the &s;upreme Power a&s;&s;i&s;ts; in Defeat and Di&s;appointment, that Power de&s;erts them. How con|formable &s;till to the holy Writings, where God is &s;aid, "To put Wi&s;dom into the Heart, to &s;trengthen it;" and on the contrary, "To make blind, and to harden the Heart."</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has often &s;aid, that &s;uch and &s;uch an Event came about by Chance, by the Vici&s;&s;itude of Fortune, and by the In&s;tability of human Affairs. Perhaps he meant the &s;ame with <HI>Homer,</HI> (&s;ince he has often mentioned the Fates, or Decrees
<PB N="171" REF="193">
of the Gods in very expre&s;s Terms) though his Meaning is not &s;o clearly pointed; but <HI>Homer</HI> is peculiarly &s;trict in his Expre&s;&s;ions, for he always makes the Will or Coun&s;el of the Supreme to be the Di&s;po&s;er of every thing; by which we may learn what worthy Sentiments he had of the true God, and that all Things mu&s;t be regulated by his wi&s;e Coun&s;el, how&s;oever they may appear mere Chance to <HI>us,</HI> who, by rea&s;on of our human Blindne&s;s and Weakne&s;s, can neither fore&s;ee nor avoid Thou&s;ands of Events, that fall out every Day and every Hour.</P>
<P>This, perhaps, you will reckon a Digre&s;&s;ion, and it is &s;o; but it opens

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOMER's Intention, as I have ob|&s;erved before, is to &s;hew us that inordinate Affections lead to Sin, and Sin to Mi&s;ery. He gives us a hundred
<PB N="173" REF="195">
In&s;tances to prove this, but the chief is, <HI>The Wrath of Achilles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great De&s;ign and Tendency of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is repeatedly &s;et forth and illu&s;trated by Mr. <HI>Pre&s;|ton</HI>; yet I cannot pre&s;ume it was through Inadver|tency to what he had once &s;aid; it was certainly his Intention &s;o to do, in order to make a &s;trong and la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion on his Pupil's Mind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the In&s;tances them&s;elves, the beautiful Order and natural Connec|tion, in which he di&s;po&s;es them, fully illu&s;trate his Propo&s;ition; and, from the whole Tenor of his Story, this Conclu|&s;ion naturally ari&s;es, that the Coun&s;el and wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition of God is fulfilled in every thing. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;hewed this in his Notes on many particular Pa&s;&s;ages throughout the <HI>Iliad</HI>; but if we take a &s;hort View of the Fable or Story,
<PB N="174" REF="196">
we &s;hall then &s;ee it in the cleare&s;t Light.</P>
<P>Though the Author begins with the <HI>Wrath of Achilles,</HI> yet, in the Cour&s;e of his Works, he takes care to &s;hew us the Source of <HI>all</HI> the Mi&s;eries which he has painted in his mo&s;t admirable Poem.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> was a Youth of royal Blood, beautiful and amorous; he &s;ung and played; he &s;educed from her Hu&s;band the mo&s;t beautiful Woman in the World, perhaps as amorous as him&s;elf. Her Hu&s;band, who had ho&s;pitably enter|tained him, re&s;ents this U&s;age : he a&s;ks the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friends, and the neigh|bouring States. They &s;ail to <HI>Troy,</HI> de|&s;troy
<PB N="175" REF="197">
the Country, and, at la&s;t, &s;it down before the Town. The Daughter to the Prie&s;t of <HI>Apollo</HI> was made a Captive. Her Father goes to redeem her. <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> refu&s;es his mo&s;t ju&s;t Suit, threatens and ill-treats him. The Prie&s;t complains to his God, who &s;ends Plagues fir&s;t upon the Grecian Cattle, then upon the People. The Cau&s;es hereof are en|quired; the Prophet is afraid of the King, but being a&s;&s;ured of Protection from <HI>Achilles,</HI> proclaims aloud the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven. <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> in&s;ults him. Hereupon a Con|te&s;t en&s;ues between <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achil|les,</HI> wherein they ill-treat each other. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> threatens to take <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Captive, <HI>Bri&s;eis,</HI> from him, and actually does it; on which <HI>Achilles</HI> refu&s;es to
<PB N="176" REF="198">
fight for the <HI>Grecians.</HI> The <HI>Trojans</HI> ob|tain many Advantages by this Refu&s;al. A Duel is propo&s;ed by <HI>Paris,</HI> and ac|cepted on the Terms propo&s;ed. <HI>Mene|laus</HI> is treacherou&s;ly wounded. The <HI>Trojans</HI> refu&s;e to re&s;tore <HI>Helen,</HI> or &s;tand to the Terms agreed on; and though <HI>Priam</HI> was certainly of the &s;ame Opinion with <HI>Antenor,</HI> that &s;he ought to be given up, yet, through Indulgence to his Son, he &s;ub&s;cribes to a Breach of the Agreement. Hereupon Battle on Battle en&s;ues. Both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans</HI> are mi&s;erably de&s;troy|ed; and con&s;equently many Proofs are given of Courage, Wi&s;dom, Piety, Con|&s;tancy, Patience, Friend&s;hip, and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, as al&s;o of Cowardice, Ra&s;hne&s;s, Brutality, Vanity, Cruelty, and almo&s;t of all Virtues and Vices. The &s;everal
<PB N="177" REF="199">
Incidents are managed with great Ad|dre&s;s. Honourable Emba&s;&s;ies are &s;ent to <HI>Achilles</HI> to return to the Service of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> He is inexorable till <HI>Hector</HI> kills his Friend. This gets the better of his Re&s;olutions; he returns to the Fight, from a Principle of Revenge, and kills <HI>Hector.</HI></P>

<PB N="178" REF="200">
&s;o naturally and orderly depending on ano|ther, that each Part &s;erves to &s;trengthen and illu&s;trate the other; and the whole leads to a Demon&s;tration of the Author's fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, to wit, that the Wrath of <HI>Achilles</HI> occa&s;ioned many and grievous Mi&s;eries to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Hence we are taught, that Strife and Di&s;&s;ention, as I have ob&s;erved before, are the certain Ruin of any common Cau&s;e, State, Kingdom, or Family; that inordinate Affections lead to Vice; that Vice increa&s;es in its Cour&s;e, in&s;omuch that one Sin, if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, begets ano|ther; and con&s;equently, &s;uch Per&s;ons as give way to their Pa&s;&s;ions and Lu&s;ts, be|come gradually degenerate, fall from bad to wor&s;e, till they are irrecoverably plun|ged in Guilt and Unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="201"><HI>Homer</HI> &s;hews us al&s;o, that the Wrath of God hangs over the Head of the wicked, whether a Nation, King, or private Per&s;on. God &s;ends his Judg|ments upon them, withdraws his A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, fights again&s;t them, &s;ends judi|cial Blindne&s;s and Hardne&s;s of Heart upon them, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts their Enemies to overthrow them; who, in executing the &s;ecret Will of Heaven, are them|&s;elves, &s;ometimes, guilty of the &s;ame Crimes he made them the In&s;truments to puni&s;h, and are, in their Turn, cha&s;|tized.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he &s;hews how much good Men, engaged in a righ|teous Cau&s;e, are favoured by Heaven. The Way to obtain this Favour he points

out to be by &s;upplicating, and &s;erving God, and the Return to be made by Thankfulne&s;s and Prai&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter written on Chri&s;t|mas-Day, and wrote to you the Day after that Date, but I had &s;ealed mine before yours came to hand, &s;o did not chu&s;e to open it.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="203">I told you in my la&s;t except one, that <HI>Homer</HI>'s Purpo&s;e in his <HI>Iliad</HI> is to &s;hew us that inordinate, ungoverned, unre&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites are the Means of leading us into Sin, and con&s;equently in|to Mi&s;ery; and that the Order and Con|nection of the Story helps to &s;et this Po|&s;ition in the &s;tronge&s;t Light. I gave you likewi&s;e a &s;hort Sketch or Argument of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Now let me comment a little on it, and we &s;hall thereby not only &s;ee <HI>Homer</HI>'s great and accurate Judgment, but di&s;cover &s;ome very valuable Truths, on which if we will well ob&s;erve, and im|prove, happy will it be for him or her who does it.</P>
<P>The Source of all this Mi&s;chief, the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and of the whole
<PB N="182" REF="204">
royal Race of that Kingdom, of infinite Woes and Mi&s;eries to their Allies, as well as to the Grecians, was <HI>an unlawful Amour.</HI> The Cau&s;e which <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;&s;igns, to wit, <HI>The Wrath of Achilles again&s;t Aga|memnon,</HI> is but an intervening, not the original Cau&s;e. <HI>The Seduction of Helen,</HI> and Breach of Ho&s;pitality, in carrying her off during her Hu&s;band's Ab&s;ence, that Hu&s;band who had entertained the Seducer kindly, who was a Per&s;on too of &s;uch Di&s;tinction, no le&s;s than a King, the&s;e, I &s;ay, were the original Source of all tho&s;e Woes and Deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>Here we cannot but admire the Judg|ment of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the Excellency of his Fable.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="205"><HI>Paris</HI> was a King's Son, <HI>Helen</HI> a Queen, two of the hand&s;ome&s;t Per&s;ons in the known World. <HI>Homer</HI> would teach us herein that hand&s;ome Men and Women are &s;ubject to much greater Inconvenien|cies of this kind, than others. Such a Man has great Advantages over the fair Sex, and &s;uch Women are more liable to Flattery, and the Danger of having their Morals &s;poiled by fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions of in|triguing Men; who never fail, when they meet with a Woman of Virtue, to endea|vour to rea&s;on her out of it, before they can hope for Succe&s;s. Not half &s;o much Pains is ordinarily taken on Women who are but homely; and we &s;ee daily that more fine Women are ruined, than others.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> cho&s;e for his Purpo&s;e two Per|&s;ons of &s;uch exalted Condition, &s;o highly
<PB N="184" REF="206">
bred, alike po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome Virtues, and yet made the Crime very black for the following Rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>Had they been Per&s;ons of mean De|gree, or abandoned Principles, they would not have made &s;o deep an Impre&s;&s;ion on our Minds; nor &s;hould we have had that Care or Concern, at lea&s;t, not that Pity for them, which, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, we feel every now and then, to return upon us.</P>
<P>If <HI>Paris</HI> had been a downright Ruffian, and <HI>Helen</HI> a low di&s;&s;olute Wretch, they could not have been of any U&s;e to the Poet then, or to us now. What can be learned from two People quite &s;unk in Debauchery? But the&s;e, though bad enough, had yet great Remor&s;es; at lea&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="207">
<HI>Helen</HI>; and <HI>Paris</HI> was not a Ruffian, though he was a Seducer. Now where &s;ome good Qualities are mixed with bad, where Virtue and Sin &s;truggle together, and &s;ometimes Honour, &s;ometimes natu|ral Frailty, gets the better, the Poet can &s;hew Human-kind as it is, and place it in a very in&s;tructive Light; otherwi&s;e, he cannot.</P>
<P>It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make the Crime very provoking, and the Per&s;on injured of a very di&s;tingui&s;hed Character, el&s;e the Poet could not, with any due Probability, have brought all <HI>Greece</HI> to|gether in Arms, to revenge the Injury. Had <HI>Helen</HI> been a Per&s;on of mean De|gree, Kings and Princes would not have leagued together to re&s;ent her Hu&s;band's
<PB N="186" REF="208">
Wrongs; had the Injury been &s;light, it could not have borne a Quarrel; nor could <HI>Homer</HI> have vindicated his Greeks, whom he is &s;o fond of, nor the Gods them&s;elves, had he built his beautiful Poem on a &s;light Event. Again, if <HI>Paris</HI> had been of low Extraction, whom could the Greeks fight again&s;t? Not <HI>Troy</HI>&mdash;for the whole State and their Allies could not have engaged in the Defence of one who was le&s;s then a King's Son. In the one Ca&s;e, <HI>Homer</HI> could not have had his Greeks to fight, in the other, he could nor have had the Trojans to fight again&s;t. On the whole, therefore, I hope you will agree with me, that the Bard was mo&s;t judicious in chu&s;ing two Per&s;ons of great Di&s;tinction, of great Beauty, and guilty of a great Crime, to be the Originals,
<PB N="187" REF="209">

<P>I would have you read over my for|mer Ob&s;ervations on this Subject, when you peru&s;e this Letter. In the tenth Year of the War between the two Na|tions, we have &s;een the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;it down
<PB N="190" REF="212">
before <HI>Troy. Homer</HI>'s Poem begins here, and the Circum&s;tance wherewith he opens it, is the Di&s;&s;ention which happens be|tween <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles.</HI> This fa|tal Difference had almo&s;t ruined the <HI>Greeks.</HI> It aro&s;e, you remember, from <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Refu&s;al to accept Ran&s;om for the Prie&s;t of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Daughter, only becau&s;e he loved her better than his own Wife.

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOSE human Frailties I was upon in my la&s;t, Partiality to our&s;elves and Uncharitablene&s;s to our Neigh|bour, are the Cau&s;es of more than half the Mi&s;chief that happens in the World. Hence it was, that our <HI>Saviour</HI> perpe|tually preached the Non-Re&s;entment and Forgivene&s;s of Offences. Nothing can &s;o much contribute to the Peace of Man|kind. To return to <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee this inordinate Affection in <HI>Agamemnon</HI> betrayed him into Pa&s;&s;ion, Rudene&s;s, and Inju&s;tice; and the&s;e
<PB N="193" REF="215">
brought on Mi&s;ery. What In&s;ults did he not undergo? What &s;tinging Re|proaches did he not endure? To what Grief, Shame, and Repentance, was he not expo&s;ed? In what Calamities did he not involve his Army? How was he con&s;trained to court and &s;ue to <HI>Achilles?</HI> And how were his Supplications reject|ed, and his Proffers &s;corned? Here is a natural Connection between his Crime, and the &s;ad Effects of it.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve likewi&s;e, his Crime was not only puni&s;hed in its own Con&s;equences, but by the ab&s;olute Interpo&s;ition of Hea|ven. The Plague is &s;ent upon the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and Burials are heaped on Bu|rials. This is exactly conformable to what our holy Religion teaches; name|ly, that one Sin naturally draws on ano|ther,
<PB N="194" REF="216">
and that the End and Wages of Sin, are Death or Mi&s;ery. Be&s;ide this inherent Puni&s;hment, God &s;ometimes &s;ends immediate Vengeance. Being e&s;|&s;entially merciful, he begins with milder Judgments; but upon Ob&s;tinacy and Impenitence he pours forth the Fullne&s;s of his Wrath. In <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes, you &s;ee the Conformity of the Procedure in this Plague, to that inflicted on <HI>Pharaoh.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> fell into a Crime of the &s;ame Nature with that of <HI>Paris,</HI> but not near &s;o heinous in Degree: the Puni&s;hments therefore were only proportionable, <HI>Troy</HI> was ut|terly de&s;troyed, for the atrocious Crime of that People, and their ob&s;tinate Con|tinuance in it. The <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;uffered &s;e|verely,
<PB N="195" REF="217">
but were not de&s;troyed; for-as-much as their Crime, or Per&s;everance therein, was not &s;o flagrant.</P>
<P>We gather al&s;o from this excellent Poem, that People are oft involved in the Vices and Puni&s;hments of their Princes. A wicked King is not only a Plague in him&s;elf to his Subjects, but, in his Sins, he calls down Judgments upon them. This is confirmed in the Scriptures, as well as in <HI>Homer.</HI> For in|&s;tance, in the 2d Book of <HI>Kings,</HI> Chap. xxiv. we read,</P>
<Q><P>Surely at the Commandment of the <HI>Lord</HI> came this upon <HI>Judah,</HI> to remove them out of his Sight, for the Sins of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> according to all that he did.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="218">And al&s;o for the innocent Blood that he &s;hed, (for he filled <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with innocent Blood) which the <HI>Lord</HI> would not pardon.</P></Q>
<P>The holy Writings teach us that Chil|dren are puni&s;hed for the Faults of their Parents. <HI>Homer</HI> &s;hews us the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We often &s;ee Children unaccountably (as far as Appearance goes) involved in the Faults of their Parents, and &s;uffering on their Account; it appears &s;trange, at fir&s;t, but on due Reflection, we mu&s;t al|low there is nothing more natural, in the common Cour&s;e of Things, than that the Sins of a Parent &s;hould fall heavy on a Child. There is &s;uch a Connec|tion between them, the one is &s;o much a
<PB N="197" REF="219">
Part of the other, that this Con&s;equence can hardly be avoided; at lea&s;t, in many In&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Scriptures teach us, that <HI>God</HI> makes one People the In&s;trument of his Ven|geance on another, and again contrary-wi&s;e. <Q><HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;hall de&s;troy <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh Ephraim</HI>;</Q> and it is &s;aid to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI></P>
<Q>You &s;hall be a Scourge and a Plague to the Heathen that are about you, and they &s;hall be a Scourge to you.</Q>
<P>Nothing can be more natural or more ju&s;t, with re&s;pect to two guilty Nations. <HI>Homer</HI> enforces the &s;ame; the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> are both guilty, but not
<PB N="198" REF="220">
equally; they are both puni&s;hed, but not equally; only in Proportion to the Size and Aggravation of their Crimes, and they were made reciprocally the Means of each other's Puni&s;hment. Through the whole Bible, particularly in the Prophets, and more e&s;pecially in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> this Doctrine is &s;trongly inculcated.</P>
<P>How amazingly great then is <HI>Homer!</HI> We find a Heathen, through the Strength and Ju&s;tne&s;s of his own Conceptions and Sentiments, agree almo&s;t in every Point with "the Word of God." And by the Tenor of the whole, his <HI>grande Morale</HI> is fully evinced; namely,</P>

<P>I'LL let <HI>Homer</HI> &s;tand &s;till a while, and give you a &s;hort De&s;cription of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>On the Road from <HI>London,</HI> we come fir&s;t within Sight of the City, at about two Miles Di&s;tance, on the Top of a pretty high Hill, called <HI>Shoot-over-Hill.</HI> Here we have a View of the River, with
<PB N="200" REF="222">
the plain Country embanking it, and on either Hand a Range of Hills. The Ri|ver below <HI>Oxford</HI> is called the <HI>Thames,</HI> but at <HI>Oxford</HI> there are two Rivers, that on the We&s;t is called the <HI>I&s;is,</HI> that on Ea&s;t the <HI>Cherwell.</HI> The one comes from the North, the other, to wit, <HI>I&s;is,</HI> from the North We&s;t. They meet at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which &s;tands in the Point between them, on a little ri&s;ing Ground, &s;urrounded with Rivers and Meadows on the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and South, and with fine Corn Fields on the North. Beyond tho&s;e Meadows and Rivers are two Tracts of pretty high Hills, covered with Pa&s;ture, Corn, and Woods intermixed. When you come within View of the Town from <HI>Shoot-over-Hill,</HI> it &s;trikes you very agreeably with a great Number of public Build|ings,
<PB N="201" REF="223">
&s;uch as Churches, Colleges, Schools, the Theatre, Printing-Hou&s;e, Dr. <HI>Rat|cliffe</HI>'s Library, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as you enter <HI>Oxford</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> you cro&s;s the <HI>Cherwell</HI> by a Bridge, thence a&s;cend gradually to the Middle of the Town; then you de&s;cend as gradually, till you come to the <HI>I&s;is,</HI> over which you pa&s;s by &s;everal Bridges. The many Ca|nals, into which the&s;e two Rivers have been cut, have been the Occa&s;ion of &s;o many Bridges about <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Their private Buildings are but ordi|nary; but the great Number of public Buildings, the Squares, Avenues of Trees, the Gardens, Groves, fine Walks, and beautiful Country around, make it a
<PB N="202" REF="224">
mo&s;t delightful Place in Summer. The Streets, for the chief Part, are clean and dry.</P>
<P>This De&s;cription, though but faint, is enough to give you a Sort of Ta&s;te of the Beauties of <HI>Oxford.</HI> If you wi&s;h to be more particularly informed, let me know, and I will do the be&s;t I can to &s;atisfy you. I &s;ubjoin a Sort of Sketch or Plan of <HI>Oxford</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drawn very correctly, though with his Pen only; a &s;trong In&s;tance of his a&s;&s;iduous Kindne&s;s, and probably more valuable to his Pupil, than the mo&s;t accurate and beautiful Engraving.</NOTE>, as well as I am able to give it. I &s;hould have told you that the two Rivers are very unlike each other; the <HI>Cherwell</HI> is deep, flow and muddy, with many Turnings and Wind|ings, the Banks overgrown, con&s;equently
<PB N="203" REF="225">
the Water not ea&s;ily to be come at in many Places. The <HI>I&s;is</HI> has a &s;trait Cour&s;e, runs pretty &s;wift, the Water clear, the Bottom gravelly and firm, and the Banks &s;mooth, clean, and di&s;engaged from Woods or Shrubs.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 1&s;t of this Month on the Day thereafter, and in Return will endeavour to gratify your Curio&s;ity re&s;pecting this City.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="226">The <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> here is one of the mo&s;t famous in the World: it is a Place for Education in all the liberal Sciences. For this Purpo&s;e, there are no le&s;s than &s;eventy Colleges, and five or &s;ix Halls, where In&s;tructors in the&s;e re&s;pective Branches re&s;ide; namely, for Divinity, Logic, Phy&s;ic, Anatomy, A&s;tronomy, Law, Rhetoric, and Languages. Each of the&s;e Colleges is a Building by it&s;elf, and many of them are very &s;tately. Each is likewi&s;e a &s;eparate Society by it&s;elf, governed by its own Laws and Cu&s;toms, under its own particular Charter; and the whole, incorporated into one great Body, is called the <HI>Univer&s;ity.</HI> Hence they derive great Privileges. The City of <HI>Oxford</HI> is &s;ubject to them: they &s;end Members to Parliament; and every Col|lege
<PB N="205" REF="227">
has a particular Founder, as a King, Queen, or other di&s;tingui&s;hed Per&s;onage.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have built and fir&s;t &s;ettled Endowments on Colleges, are called the Founders; tho&s;e who have left Sums of Money, Lands, or Books, &s;ince their Foundation, are &s;tiled Benefactors.</P>
<P>The Halls were originally Buildings belonging to &s;ome particular Colleges, though &s;eparated from them, and were erected for the Conveniency of lodging Students, when the Colleges were too much crowded; or for the Reception of the Sons of great Men, who did not like to be confined to &s;trict College-Hours. But now Things are altered.
<PB N="206" REF="228">
Some of the Halls have been turned into Colleges, and others are wholly inde|pendent of them.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire, perhaps, to know the Dif|ference between the&s;e Buildings.</P>
<P>A College is a Body corporate within them&s;elves, who have a Charter of their own, and can buy and &s;ell, take and en|joy by Gift or Legacy, in their own Name. The Charter is a Grant from the King.</P>
<P>A Hall has one Head or Chief, in the &s;ame Manner as a College, and, like that, is al&s;o a Part of the Univer&s;ity. It has its own Rules, Orders, and Govern|ment, but no Charter, con&s;equently is
<PB N="207" REF="229">
not a Body Corporate within it&s;elf. The Society po&s;&s;e&s;s no Lands nor Rents, nor can they take and enjoy, like a College, in their own Name. When any thing is given or bequeathed for their U&s;e, they cannot hold it them&s;elves, but mu&s;t lodge it in the Univer&s;ity for their U&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many good Schools in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> but not an Univer&s;ity. The Rea&s;on is plain. <HI>London</HI> is a Place of great Hurry and Bu&s;ine&s;s, full of Temptations and Avocations. <HI>Oxford</HI> is a retired Place, &s;urrounded with Gardens, Woods, Groves, Hills, Meadows, and Rivers.
<Q>The&s;e Scenes the Mu&s;es haunt, and Phoebus loves.</Q>
at lea&s;t &s;o the Poets tell us.</P>

<P>I TOOK Notice to you formerly, that not alone the fine Moral, and the great and important Subject of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem was to be admired, but al&s;o his judicious Manner of conducting it, and the Beauty of the whole Contexture of his Fable or Story; whence it is not only plea&s;ant as well as profitable, but from being plea&s;ant, it makes a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on our Memories, and we re|collect it with continual Satisfaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Writer &s;eems admirably to have adopted this agreeable Precept in his own Practice. He catches hold of every Opportunity to throw in that Simplicity and Playfulne&s;s, which make In&s;truction mo&s;t engaging. A Tribute of this Kind is paid to the Memory of Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> in an elegant Latin In&s;cription, in the Cloi&s;ter of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey.</HI> The Monument is &s;aid to be erected by the Scholar of that Foundation. From this In|&s;cription I have taken my Motto for this Work, the Turn of it being &s;o immediately adapted to our Tu|tor's Di&s;po&s;ition. May I be forgiven, if I here &s;ubjoin the whole, and pre&s;ume to add an humble Imitation of it in Engli&s;h, which I have been in|duced to attempt, merely from the Delight I have taken in the Original? <Q><LG>

<P><PB N="210" REF="232"><HI>Homer</HI> has made u&s;e of wonderful Stra|tagems for this Purpo&s;e. The Enume|ration of the Ships, the Names of the Commanders, the geographical De&s;crip|tion of the &s;everal Countries they came from; the characteri&s;tic Di&s;tinction of the Leaders; the nice Plot contrived to give us an Idea even of the Make and Shape of their Per&s;ons, in bringing <HI>Helen</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="233">
to de&s;cribe them to old <HI>Priam</HI>; the en|gaging of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> fir&s;t, then of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Hector,</HI> in &s;ingle Battle; the manife&s;t Advantage he gives to <HI>Me|nelaus,</HI> and a &s;ort of Advantage to <HI>Ajax,</HI> though not great; the <HI>Trojans</HI> breaking
<PB N="212" REF="234">
the Truce, wounding <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and re|fu&s;ing to re&s;tore <HI>Helen</HI>&mdash;All the&s;e &s;erve to vindicate the Greeks, and a&s;cribe Blame to the Trojans.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that, though &s;everal of the Grecian Heroes have, now and then, the Advantage over <HI>Hector,</HI> yet he, in his Turn, has the Advantage over every one of them. This is, that the Poet may give the greater Honour to <HI>Achilles,</HI> who is the only Man de&s;igned at la&s;t to con|quer <HI>Hector</HI>; and not even then without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Deity, nor till Heaven had abandoned <HI>Hector.</HI> We &s;ee too that <HI>Hector,</HI> though the be&s;t Man among all the Heroes, either Greek or Trojan, and the Man whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> loves for his Piety and other Virtues, was yet involved
<PB N="213" REF="235">
in the common Calamity. He fought, 'tis true, from Love to his Country and Family, but he fought on the wrong Side. How agreeable this to the holy Scripture! There we find national Sins draw down Judgments on &s;uch particu|lar Per&s;ons as are, no Matter by what Means, involved therein.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of good old <HI>Priam</HI> &s;eems to be the &s;ame with that of good old <HI>Eli.</HI> Though <HI>Priam</HI> approved not of his Son <HI>Paris</HI>'s Crime, yet he was indulgent to him, and did not compel him to do Ju&s;|tice. Herein his Default was parallel to that of <HI>Eli,</HI> of whom the Lord &s;ays to <HI>Samuel,</HI></P>
<Q>I will judge his Hou&s;e for ever, for the Iniquity which he knoweth; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="214" REF="236">
his Sons made them&s;elves vile, and he re&s;trained them not. <BIBL><HI>Sam.</HI> B. I. C. i. Ver. 13.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It is worth your while to read this whole Chapter and that preceding it.</P>
<P>In Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes you will read the &s;everal In&s;tances of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Judg|ment in the whole Conduct of his Story, &s;o I need not repeat them. I &s;hall men|tion only two.</P>
<P>You know it is a Proof of great Judg|ment in a Poet, to &s;uit every Circum|&s;tance with Propriety, and to make his Per&s;onages act in Character. There is an In&s;tance of the former, when <HI>Homer,</HI> to relieve us from the Fury of a Battle,
<PB N="215" REF="237">
brings in his Heroes in a &s;ort of Parley, as that between <HI>Glaucus</HI> and <HI>Diomede,</HI> to which I refer you. Another In&s;tance is in his fit Di&s;po&s;al of Time, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has ob&s;erved, in that bu&s;y Night, which preceded <HI>Hector</HI>'s breaking in upon the Grecian Intrenchments.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate his Per&s;ons acting up to Character, con&s;ider the Care and Con|cern <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> is in, when the Emba&s;&s;y is &s;ent to <HI>Achilles.</HI> You know the Emba&s;|&s;adors were <HI>Uly&s;&s;es, Phoenix,</HI> and <HI>Ajax.</HI> Ob&s;erve their different Characters, their different Modes of Behaviour; the dif|ferent Impre&s;&s;ions their Speeches made on <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the different Treatment he gave them. Again, ob&s;erve the dif|ferent Demeanour of the Grecian He|roes
<PB N="216" REF="238">
on that melancholy Night, when (as the Poet expre&s;&s;es it)
<Q><L><HI>Hector</HI>'s Approach in ev'ry Wind they hear,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hector</HI>'s Fury ev'ry Moment fear.</L></Q></P>
<P>All this is worthy to be remarked with the utmo&s;t Care. It is admirably fine, and proves to what a great De|gree <HI>Homer</HI> has kept up to what the Critics call MORES, the MANNERS.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DARE &s;ay you are beginning to be weary of <HI>Homer,</HI> as well as you love him, and of the many Ob&s;ervations we have made, therefore we will drop him after this and my next Letter&mdash;at lea&s;t for &s;ome Time, and find another Subject for our epi&s;tolary Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that when <HI>Achilles</HI> was reconciled to <HI>Aga|memnon,</HI> it was not either that his Anger was abated, or that the Love of his Country or his Countrymen got the bet|ter
<PB N="221" REF="243">
of it, but another Piece of Re&s;ent|ment and De&s;ire of Revenge got the bet|ter of the former, as it was incompati|ble with the other. And this new Re|&s;entment of his was &s;till more furious than the fir&s;t, and much more unrea|&s;onable; for certainly <HI>Hector</HI> was in the right to kill <HI>Patroclus</HI>; and though <HI>Achil|les</HI> might lament the Death of his Friend, yet there was no Rea&s;on for his exer|ci&s;ing &s;uch a brutal Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t a fair Enemy.</P>
<P>You will find this very agreeable to the Accounts we have in the Holy Scrip|tures of the Di&s;pen&s;ations of God, who makes every thing, even the Sins and Follies of People, contribute to advance and bring about the Completion of his
<PB N="222" REF="244">
&s;acred Purpo&s;es and Will. It &s;till &s;erves too to illu&s;trate his <HI>grande Morale,</HI> which he never lo&s;es Sight of,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q></P>
<P>The Jews, when they cried out again&s;t our Saviour, <HI>Crucify him, crucify him,</HI> little dreamed that they were forwarding the Salvation of Mankind; nor had <HI>Ju|das</HI> any &s;uch De&s;ign when he betrayed him; neither did the High Prie&s;t know the grand Import of his own Words, when he &s;aid, <Q>It was expedient for one Man to die for the People.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Providence puni&s;hed the Greeks by the Fiercene&s;s of <HI>Achilles</HI>; and by that very Fiercene&s;s &s;aved them, when re|conciled to them. Many are the In|&s;tances
<PB N="223" REF="245">
of this Kind in the &s;acred Writ|ings. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays,</P>
<Q>The Wrath of Man &s;hall turn to thy Prai&s;e, and the Re&s;idue thereof thou &s;halt re&s;train.</Q>
<P>Another Thing very well worth ob|&s;erving, and which is &s;till a great Proof and Illu&s;tration of the Truth of the above Moral, is this: <HI>Homer</HI> never brings any great Event to bear, any fortunate Act to be performed, or noble Virtue exer|ci&s;ed, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a divine Power. When his Heroes fail, it is be|cau&s;e the <HI>Gods</HI> have for&s;aken them. Do they &s;ucceed? It is becau&s;e the <HI>Gods</HI> are with them. Do they act prudently?

The <HI>Gods</HI> blind them. But then it is as ob&s;ervable, that this is the Re&s;ult of their own Conduct and Principles. There is a Something in their Minds which renders them either dear or de|te&s;table to the Deities.

<P>La&s;tly, you &s;ee the Means of ac|quiring the Favour of the Supreme was, next to a virtuous Life, be&s;peaking him by Prayer. This is the Practice of all <HI>Homer</HI>'s great Men; and the Succe&s;s of their Undertakings was always accom|panied with Sacrifices of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving. This was under&s;tood to
<PB N="225" REF="247">
be an indi&s;pen&s;able Return of Duty and Gratitude to the Gods. When <HI>Hector</HI> e&s;capes &s;afe from <HI>Diomede,</HI> the latter cries out,
<Q><L>Once more thank <HI>Phoebus</HI> for thy forfeit Breath,</L>
<L>Well by <HI>Apollo</HI> are thy Pray'rs repaid.</L></Q>
And <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;ays, in more Places than one, when &s;peaking in <HI>Hector</HI>'s Favour, <Q>That he had offered many Sacrifices to the Deities.</Q></P>
<P>Thus as the&s;e Heroes imputed the E&s;cape of their Enemies to &s;ome God, &s;o when they expre&s;&s;ed their Hopes of getting the better of them, they are fre|quently accu&s;tomed to &s;ay, <Q>If &s;uch or &s;uch a God a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</Q> Herein they conformed to the Phra&s;e in Scripture; <Q>They did not put their Tru&s;t in their

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SAID, in a former Letter, that I had done with <HI>Homer,</HI> but I find I have not.</P>
<P>In order to make his Morals, or the Application of his Doctrine, reli&s;h bet|ter, he has beautifully diver&s;ified his Story. He has introduced many Epi&s;odes that are very delightful: for Example, that which <HI>Glaucus</HI> tells to <HI>Diomede,</HI> that which <HI>Phoenix</HI> tells to <HI>Achilles,</HI> that which <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> relates, and many others. Ob|&s;erve too, they are always told in a
<PB N="230" REF="252">
proper Place, and always recommend &s;ome Virtue, or arraign &s;ome Vice.</P>
<P>Many of his Epi&s;odes and other Sto|ries have al&s;o the &s;ame Tendency with the great De&s;ign; that is to &s;ay, to &s;hew the ill Effects of Divi&s;ion, Re&s;entment, and ob&s;tinate Revenge, particularly that of <HI>Phoenix</HI> to <HI>Achilles</HI>; or to &s;hew us that inordinate Lu&s;ts, Affections, or Ap|petites, lead to Sin and Mi&s;ery; or to il|lu&s;trate the <HI>grande Morale,</HI> <Q>That God's Will mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed, and his Coun&s;el mu&s;t &s;tand.</Q> And by conti|nually mixing the&s;e Stories in his Work, he calls up our Attention to the great Purpo&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this great Purpo&s;e, he gives us occa&s;ional Precepts; In&s;tances of what
<PB N="231" REF="253">
is fit, decent, prudent, and of their Con|traries. He &s;ets before our Eyes many beautiful and u&s;eful Things in Nature, as of the Heavens, the Earth, rural Labours, Winter, Summer, Harve&s;t, Rocks, Mountains, Rivers, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as likewi&s;e of artificial Things, name|ly, of War, Peace, Commerce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I refer you to what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;aid hereon.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing that I &s;hall de&s;ire you to ob&s;erve, is this. Though the main De&s;ign of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is to &s;hew us that Mi|&s;ery flows from Sin, and Sin from un|bridled Appetites, yet he therein pre|&s;ents us with many In&s;tances of Happi|ne&s;s and Succe&s;s flowing from doing our Duty; and contrary-wi&s;e in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="254">
though the main Tendency of that Poem be to &s;hew that Happine&s;s &s;lows from a Di&s;charge of our Duty to God and Man, (which is the Con&s;equence of &s;ubduing our Pa&s;&s;ions) yet he mixes, in the Cour&s;e of his Story, frequent In&s;tances of Mi|&s;ery ari&s;ing out of Sin.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;I fancy to my&s;elf that I &s;ee <HI>Homer,</HI> like a mo&s;t renowned old Philo&s;opher, or one of the ancient Pro|phets, preaching to his Countrymen in this Manner&mdash;"Learn, O my Country|men, that all Unhappine&s;s proceeds from Sin, and Sin proceeds from inordinate Affections. Learn that all Happine&s;s proceeds from Virtue, and Virtue from hearkening to the Dictates of Rea&s;on; that in the one Ca&s;e God will a&s;&s;i&s;t you,
<PB N="233" REF="255">
in the other, de&s;ert you. To obtain his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you mu&s;t depend on him; you mu&s;t a&s;cribe all to him that you do well; you mu&s;t apply to him by &s;er|vent Prayer; and not that alone, but you mu&s;t leave Vice and embrace Virtue, otherwi&s;e God will not hearken to you, though you make many Prayers; and when he ble&s;&s;es and a&s;&s;i&s;ts you, you mu&s;t render him the Sacrifice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving."</P>
<P>"To confirm the fir&s;t of the&s;e my Doc|trines, I will tell you a Story of the Wrath of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the Quarrel that happened between him and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> &s;upreme Leader of the Grecians, at the Siege of Troy; which, be&s;ides confirm|ing my fir&s;t Doctrine, will plainly prove
<PB N="234" REF="256">
that Divi&s;ions and Di&s;&s;en&s;ions among People united in a common Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t, though they may con&s;i&s;t of many little independent States and Sovereign|ties, mu&s;t probably be the Ruin of them all. This may be the Ca&s;e of Greece; and you may be &s;wallowed up by &s;ome great Prince or other, if Divi&s;ions be rai&s;ed and encouraged among you."</P>
<P>"To prove my &s;econd Doctrine, to wit, that bridling your Pa&s;&s;ions, acting with Patience, Prudence, and Piety, and con|&s;equently having God to favour you, will lead you to Succe&s;s through the greate&s;t Difficulties, I will tell you a Story of the Travels of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> And from both you may derive this important Truth; name|ly, that every thing what&s;oever is or|dered,
<PB N="235" REF="257">
di&s;po&s;ed, governed, conducted, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the all-wi&s;e, all-pow|erful, and immutably-certain Will of God, and mu&s;t be brought to the Period that he has &s;et and determined."</P>
<P>If you have <HI>Creech's Horace</HI> at Hand, read the &s;econd Epi&s;tle of his fir&s;t Book of Epi&s;tles. It is in&s;cribed to <HI>Lollius.</HI> You will &s;ee there in what View he con|&s;iders the&s;e two Poems.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now gone through another Book of <HI>Homer,</HI> and made the follow|ing Remarks.</P>
<P>Book xix. Ver&s;e 57. <HI>Achilles</HI> confirms the Ob&s;ervation I formerly made; name|ly, that it was not the Love of his Country, but a new Re&s;entment, that incited him; and though he preaches here again&s;t Re&s;entment and ob&s;tinate Fury, yet it is ob&s;tinate Fury which here po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him, and actually makes him preach again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="274">Ver&s;e 81. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in his Speech confirms your Ob&s;ervation, laying the Blame of his Folly on Fate, and the Gods, and thinks thereby to clear him|&s;elf of the Imputation. I think the Story he tells here, though to the Purpo&s;e, might have been &s;pared. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob|&s;erves very ju&s;tly, that <HI>Homer</HI> always regards due Decorum. He makes <HI>Achil|les</HI> ri&s;e, but <HI>Agamemnon</HI> &s;it &s;till.</P>
<P>Verfe 281. Here <HI>Achilles</HI> imputes the Blame of his own Folly to <HI>Jove,</HI> as <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> did before; and herein, as in other In&s;tances, it may be &s;aid that <HI>Ho|mer</HI> means to remind us of the great Ten|dency of his Poem; for he tells us, it was the high Will of <HI>Jove</HI> that doomed their Strife, and doomed the Greeks to fall.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="275">Book xx. Ver&s;e 335. I think what <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> has &s;aid in this Note is very rea&s;onable, and as &s;trong as any thing Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;aid again&s;t it. How the Fact really was is hard to know at this Di&s;tance of Time.</P>
<P>I &s;halt fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay on the <HI>Iliad</HI> in two more Letters, I believe, and hope to conclude this Week.</P>

<P>AT the Beginning of Book the Twen|ty-fir&s;t, the De&s;cription of the Flood endeavouring to drown <HI>Achilles</HI> is the Produce of a va&s;t Imagination. The Compari&s;on at Ver&s;e 14, is admira|ble, as is al&s;o the Conflagration, and the Effect it had on the Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But, with Submi&s;&s;ion, I think all the Scuffle between <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> Ver&s;e 558, very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Verfe 608. This Compari&s;on, and the Note upon it, proves, what I have often
<PB N="253" REF="277">
ob&s;erved, a Conformity between <HI>Homer</HI> and our Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Book xxii. Ver&s;e 221. A further Con|firmation how dear are pious Men to God.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 278. Read the Notes here. Me|thinks Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> overacts the Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> in this Place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Note here entirely belongs to <HI>Eu&s;ta|thius; Pope</HI> is not actually, only negatively, involv|ed in it, merely by not having contradicted what was a&s;&s;erted by the other.</NOTE>. They explain the &s;upernatural A&s;&s;i&s;tances which <HI>Achilles</HI> receives, into Allegory; yet af|firm the like, when &s;hewn to <HI>Hector,</HI> to be real, merely to favour, or rather to ag|grandize the Valour of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="278">Ver&s;e 628. Here is &s;urely one of the mo&s;t beautiful Pa&s;&s;ages in the whole <HI>Iliad</HI>; and what <HI>Andromache</HI> ob&s;erves and complains of, we find verified to this Day. It ever has, and will be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Lamentations of <HI>Priam, Hecuba,</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> in this Book, and tho&s;e of <HI>Hecuba, Helen,</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> in the la&s;t, are all different; they ari&s;e from dif|ferent Motives, and each Per&s;on utters what immediately belongs to his or her Character and Circum&s;tances; a further Proof how judiciou&s;ly <HI>Homer</HI> has pre|&s;erved the <HI>Manners</HI> throughout his Poem. It is again evinced in Book xxiii. Ver&s;e 41. The Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this Place how very con&s;i&s;tent! The Appear|ance of the Gho&s;t of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and all that pa&s;&s;es, is extremely fine.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="279">In the Detail of Prizes given to the Racers, at the funeral Games, ob&s;erve the following Lines;
<Q><L>A Woman for the fir&s;t, in Beauty's Bloom,</L>
<L>Skill'd in the Needle and the lab'ring Loom.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do they not imply, with many other Pa&s;&s;ages in this Poem, that Women, how beautiful &s;oever, are not prized, without &s;ome u&s;eful and laudable Qua|lification?</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 369. Here we have a beautiful Picture of an old Man in&s;tructing his Son how to win the Prize; and we al&s;o di&s;cern with what an exten&s;ive Genius <HI>Homer</HI> was ble&s;&s;ed; for the Rules that <HI>Ne&s;|tor</HI> gave, being univer&s;ally u&s;eful, are as much in Force now as they were then.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="280">The Ob&s;ervation on Line 817, by Madame <HI>Dacier,</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s &s;ubjoined Sneer, are, in my Opinion, equally non-&s;en&s;ical.</P>
<P>The Note on Ver&s;e 973, beginning at the&s;e Words, <Q>But al&s;o his De&s;ign might be to compliment the Greeks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> is by no Means ju&s;t, and even contradicts what the Author has often &s;aid of <HI>Ajax.</HI></P>
<P>To return to the very fir&s;t Note on this Book, I cannot concur with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Opinion in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Conduct, in carrying on his Work for two Books after the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> He urges that <HI>Homer</HI>'s Undertaking was to de|&s;cribe the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and as that
<PB N="257" REF="281">
Anger did not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but per|&s;ecuted even his Remains, &s;o the Poet &s;till keeps up to his Subject. But Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with Deference I &s;peak it, is mi&s;taken; it is not &s;imply the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Subject, but that particular Anger and Re&s;entment which was &s;o de&s;tructive to <HI>Greece,</HI> and took Birth from his Di&s;&s;en&s;ion with <HI>Aga|memnon.</HI> This Subject, after the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> is entirely exhau&s;ted, and the Revenge then pur&s;ued is of a different Nature from the <HI>Wrath</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> un|dertook to &s;ing; for in&s;tead of being de&s;tructive, it then becomes advantageous to the Greeks.</P>
<P>In my next I &s;hall give you my Opi|nion of the Rea&s;ons which induced the
<PB N="258" REF="282">
Author to protract his Work beyond the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> I thought to have done it here, and &s;o have fini&s;hed this Sub|ject of our Letters, but the A&s;&s;izes are now held in this City. Some Gentle|men from London engage my Time, and an Acount I have ju&s;t received of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Death unnerves my Spirits.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now read the <HI>Iliad</HI> to an End, and have but few Remarks to make on the two la&s;t Books.</P>
<P>Book xxiii. Ver&s;e 41.</P>
<Q><L>The huge Ox bellowing falls; with feebler Cries</L>
<L>Expires the Goat; the Sheep in Silence dies.</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e two Lines are a ju&s;t Picture of the Nature of the re&s;pective Animals. How characteri&s;tically affecting is the la&s;t to a tender Mind!</P>
<P>Ver. 120. Here are eight fine Lines, and they &s;hew us what was the Creed at that
<PB N="260" REF="284">
Time. The la&s;t, I think, much exceeds the Original.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Notes e&s;caped me when I wrote la&s;t, as many other Things do; and indeed Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Excellence in Critici&s;m has left very little in the Power of any &s;ucceeding Commentator. I &s;el|dom repeat to you what he has &s;aid, unle&s;s I think it &s;o remarkable as to de|&s;erve your peculiar Attention.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the twenty-fourth Book, and &s;hall con&s;equently very &s;oon put an End to this Subject, which has entertained us &s;o long.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 5. This De&s;cription of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Lamentation is admirable, though the
<PB N="261" REF="285">
Lines 17 and 18, are not, in my Judg|ment, &s;o full and &s;o expre&s;&s;ive as in the Original, which is as follows, if literally rendered:</P>
<Q>Sometimes he lay on his Side, &s;ome|times he turned quickly on his Back, then he lay prone on his Face, and then he &s;tood &s;trait up on his Feet.</Q>
<P>Ver&s;e 291. This is an exceeding na|tural Picture of a Per&s;on, particularly one in Years, overwhelmed with Grief. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note is mo&s;t judicious, and well worthy Attention. There is no|thing more common than for a Parent, in the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of Affliction, to prefer a Child that is dead, to all who remain alive.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="286">I have done now with particular Re|marks; and though we have dwelt on this Subject &s;o long, I yet feel a De&s;ire to communicate my general Sentiments, I mean my Opinion of <HI>Homer</HI>'s continu|ing his Poem beyond the Reconciliation of <HI>Achilles</HI> with <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> Perhaps I may not expre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o well as to be under&s;tood, or my Arguments may ap|pear too &s;ubtle; not &s;olid enough. Be that as it may, I &s;hall expect an impar|tial Account of your Sen&s;e of them, and what your Sentiments really and unre|&s;ervedly are on the &s;ame Point.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the&s;e my general Sentiments on our great Bard, I mu&s;t be very frank, and the rather to induce you to be &s;o in your An&s;wer. I profe&s;s my&s;elf of a dif|ferent Opinion from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> concern|ing the Rea&s;ons which induced <HI>Homer</HI> to carry on his Work beyond the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> I am apt to think the true Rea&s;on was, that the Poet had many more beautiful Things to &s;ay, which he was unwilling &s;hould be lo&s;t; and truly I am glad they were not. But then the Que&s;tion is, whether he has done
<PB N="264" REF="288">
judiciou&s;ly in protracting the Work, ra|ther than to clo&s;e it with the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> has fini&s;hed the <HI>Aeneid</HI> with that of <HI>Turnus.</HI></P>
<P>To form a right Judgment hereon, we &s;hould con&s;ider the Subjects of the re&s;pective Poems; that is, what tho&s;e two great Poets propo&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>The Subject of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is the At|chievements as well as Sufferings of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> till he brought about a Settle|ment in a new Kingdom, for him&s;elf, his Family, and the People in <HI>Italy.</HI> To the Accompli&s;hment of all this there was no Ob&s;truction but the Rival&s;hip of <HI>Turnus</HI>; con&s;equently, on his Death, all
<PB N="265" REF="289">
is compleated. There was no need to carry the Work further; though one <HI>Ma&s;shoeus</HI> has added a thirteenth Book, wherein <HI>Aeneas</HI> is married to <HI>Lavinia.</HI> But this is &s;uperfluous. The great Ob&s;ta|cle being removed, the Poet leaves us to imagine all the re&s;t. What he had pro|po&s;ed was entirely fulfilled; to wit, all the Sufferings his Hero had to undergo with Seas and Winds, with Men and Gods, and all the cro&s;s Accidents he had to wre&s;tle with, and bravely &s;ubdue by his Patience or Exploits. But it is not &s;o in the <HI>Iliad.</HI> The Poet there pro|po&s;es to &s;ing the fatal <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of the Re&s;entment of <HI>Achilles.</HI> It was therefore very ju&s;tifiable in him to carry on his Work beyond the Time that Re&s;ent|ment la&s;ted. If it ought to have ended
<PB N="266" REF="290">
with that, there was no Need to make him kill <HI>Hector</HI>; for that Event fell with|out the Period of his Re&s;entment to <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> which is the Ground-work of his Poem. But the Poet certainly de&s;igned to &s;hew not only the &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ters that befel the <HI>Greeks</HI> through the Re|&s;entment of <HI>Achilles,</HI> but to give &s;till a &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion of the bad Effects of Di&s;&s;en&s;ion among Chiefs, as well as other Per&s;ons, who&s;e Intere&s;ts are united. He paints the great Change of the Grecian Affairs for the better, on his Reconcilia|tion with the Leader of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Ships are &s;aved, <HI>Hector</HI> is killed, the Tro|jans are repul&s;ed, and driven within their Town. What follows, namely, the dragging the Coar&s;e of <HI>Hector</HI> round <HI>Troy,</HI> the Grief and Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> on
<PB N="267" REF="291">
the Lo&s;s of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> the In&s;titution of the <HI>Games</HI> at his Funeral, all this is in order to compleat the Character of his Hero; to &s;hew us his Virtues as well as his Vices. He makes him an extra|ordinary Per&s;on both Ways; and yet of va&s;t, nay of ab&s;olute Importance to the &s;ucce&s;sful I&s;&s;ue of the War. He has probably given him this mixed Charac|ter, as a Le&s;&s;on how Princes and Rulers ought to manage Per&s;ons of great Impor|tance, who have &s;trong Qualities, both good and bad; &s;o that they may turn the former to their Advantage, and, by a cautionary Prudence, divert any bad Ef|fects from the latter.</P>
<P>To point out the Importance of <HI>Achil|les</HI> &s;till &s;tronger, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et
<PB N="268" REF="292">
forth that of <HI>Hector.</HI> Though this is done throughout the whole Work, while <HI>Hector</HI> lived, it is not &s;ufficient. The Poet does not &s;top there. The Circum|&s;tances of his Death, the Lamentations of his Father, Mother, Wife, Si&s;ter, <HI>He|len,</HI> and the whole People, the Beha|viour of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and indeed <HI>Achil|les</HI>'s own Speech, after he had killed him, render him &s;till more important, than all that had been &s;aid or de&s;cribed of him before.</P>
<P>Add hereunto the Approbation in which he was held by <HI>Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury,</HI> and almo&s;t all the Gods; their Re&s;ent|ment at <HI>Achilles</HI> on his Account; their compelling the Body to be delivered up to honourable Burial, and <HI>Achilles</HI> him&s;elf lifting it on the Bier.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="293">I am apt to think that Piety, which <HI>Homer</HI> has all along recommended, was the great Le&s;&s;on he propo&s;ed to incul|cate, by this la&s;t Book. The Prai&s;es of <HI>Hector</HI> for his Piety occur &s;o thick, and the Concern of the Gods for his Death is &s;o &s;trongly painted, that one would be tempted to believe <HI>Hector</HI> was as much his Hero as <HI>Achilles,</HI> only of another Kind; and though the Poet condemns the Cau&s;e he was concerned in, and makes him &s;uffer for it, yet he &s;eems to be more in Love with him, than with his profe&s;&s;ed Hero. He does ample Ju&s;tice to his Virtues, and &s;eems to make him, much rather than <HI>Achilles,</HI> a Pattern for Imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="294">Remember you are to &s;end me your free Opinion on all I have &s;aid. I don't de&s;ire you to write very long Letters. Write two or three &s;hort ones at dif|ferent Times, and then put them all under one Cover.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Favour of the 14th, but have not yet laid in Provi&s;ion for a Letter on the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> I have at la&s;t
<PB N="271" REF="295">
read the two Plays you de&s;ired me, <HI>Sir Fopling Flutter</HI> and <HI>Sir Courtly Nice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Man of Mode,</HI> or <HI>Sir Fopling Flut|ter,</HI> was fir&s;t written. The Author was a high-bred Gentleman; his Characters are well drawn; the Dialogue is ea&s;y, natural, and genteel; there is a great deal of Wit and good Sen&s;e in the Con|ver&s;ation among the principal Characters, e&s;pecially between <HI>Dorimant</HI> and <HI>Loveit,</HI> and between the &s;ame Gentleman and <HI>Harriet. Old Bellair</HI> is very entertaining; he is good-natured, plea&s;ant, open, and &s;incere: in a Word, he is a downright Country Gentleman, of the be&s;t Sort.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, the <HI>Spectator,</HI> long ago, cen&s;ured this Play, as being built
<PB N="272" REF="296">
on a wrong Foundation; for, &s;ays he, "the End of it is to promote Vice." <HI>Dorimant,</HI> his fine Gentleman, is a Wit, well bred, of excellent Sen&s;e, and ex|tremely engaging, but totally devoid of Faith and Honour. <HI>Harriet,</HI> the fine Lady, is perpetually de&s;pi&s;ing her Mother. The Scene of the Orange-Woman and drunken Shoemaker is too gro&s;s, and ought not to have been brought into &s;uch polite Company. A Lady of good Qua|lity, and a fine young Heire&s;s, lodging in an Orange-Woman's Hou&s;e, is, I think, wrong judged; and <HI>Dorimant</HI> af|firming his Intention of marrying <HI>Harriet</HI> was to repair his Fortune, is, in my Opinion, out of Character; unle&s;s that, as a Rake, he thought Shame to own that he was really in Love; but,
<PB N="273" REF="297">
&s;urely, even that is driving the Rake too far for <HI>Dorimant.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spectator,</HI> after having remarked &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in this Comedy, adds, <Q>This whole celebrated Piece is a per|fect Contradiction to good Manners, good Sen&s;e, and common Hone&s;ty. Nothing but being lo&s;t to a Sen&s;e of Innocence and Virtue can make any one &s;ee it, without ob&s;erving more frequent Occa&s;ion to move Sorrow and Indignation, than Mirth and Laughter.</Q> He had great Rea&s;on indeed for what he &s;aid. The Sufferance of &s;uch immoral Pieces perverts the true Intent of the Stage, which was meant to be a Place of in&s;tructive Amu&s;e|ment, not empty Di&s;&s;ipation. That Mr.
<PB N="274" REF="298">
<HI>Addi&s;on</HI> con&s;idered it in this Light, is evident, from the two Pieces he gave to the Theatre, <HI>Cato,</HI> and the <HI>Drummer.</HI> The Growth of licentious Pieces is principally, if not altogether, to be a&s;cribed to the vitiated Ta&s;te of an Audience. The vulgar Expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>If there were no Receivers, there would be no Knaves,</Q> may be here not un|aptly alluded to: <Q>If there were no En|couragers of immoral Pieces, none &s;uch would be repre&s;ented.</Q> It can|not be doubted but the Regulator of a Theatre would rather de&s;ire to &s;ee it a Seat of Decorum, than of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or that an Actor would be better plea&s;ed to utter Sentiments of Truth and Virtue, than tho&s;e of Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="299">The other Play, <HI>Sir Courtly Nice,</HI> &s;eems to be an Imitation of <HI>The Man of Mode,</HI> though a faint one. Notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome good Things in the for|mer, yet the Characters are not by far &s;o genteel, nor is there &s;o much Wit or good Sen&s;e in the Dialogue, as in the latter. <HI>Farewel</HI> is a &s;ort of <HI>Dorimant,</HI> only not vicious. <HI>The Aunt</HI> is a Copy of <HI>Lady Woodvill,</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> of <HI>Harriet.</HI> The Contra&s;t between <HI>Hothead</HI> and <HI>Te&s;ti|mony</HI> is diverting, but I cannot think they are naturally brought in. <HI>Sir Courtly Nice</HI> is well drawn, but not &s;o delightful a Fop as <HI>Sir Fopling</HI>; nor do I think his Foppery &s;avours &s;o much of the "Gen|tleman." I do not know what to make of <HI>Lord Belguard.</HI> I think him in the main a &s;illy Fellow, though perhaps
<PB N="276" REF="300">
with &s;ome Smattering of good Sen&s;e and Breeding. <HI>Hothead</HI>'s Behaviour to him is quite <HI>outr&eacute;e, Crack</HI>'s Character appears overdone, and the unravelling of the Plot not entirely natural. <HI>Surly</HI> altogether is too gro&s;s, though &s;ome Part of what he he &s;ays is entertaining enough. There are certainly many wor&s;e Plays. The Pur|po&s;e and Tendency of this Piece being rather good than otherwi&s;e, gives it, in my Opinion, one material A&s;cendancy over <HI>The Man of Mode.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps what I have &s;aid may engage you to read them over again, and then I &s;hall be glad to have your Opinion of them.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 20, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read over the third and fourth Books of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>The Advice which <HI>Mentor,</HI> or rather <HI>Pallas</HI> in his Shape, gives to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> at the Opening of the third Book, is mo&s;t admirably prudent and ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="309">Ver&s;e 62 and 63, are very poetical and in&s;tructive, to all Degrees of Life.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 282. Notwith&s;tanding what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays here about the Force of De&s;tiny, I think no other Defence can be made for <HI>Telemachus,</HI> than his Youth, and that Impatience which naturally ari&s;es from a long Endurance of Afflictions. The An|&s;wer of <HI>Pallas,</HI> which is mo&s;t admirable, certainly points it out.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 333. What a charming In&s;tance have we here of the Power of good Ad|vice, when delivered in a plea&s;ing amiable Way! Poetry and Mu&s;ic, united with divine or moral Precepts, con&s;pire to keep the Mind from giving way to Temptation.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="310">Ver&s;e 429. Be&s;ides that this is a very judicious Ob&s;ervation in the Poet, for the Rea&s;ons which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> a&s;&s;igns in his Note, it includes an excellent moral Pre|cept to Mankind.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 496 to 515. What an admirable Picture is given us of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> and his Fa|mily!</P>
<P>Book iv. Ver&s;e 437. I cannot but think it &s;omewhat indecent in <HI>Telemachus</HI> to &s;tile his Father <HI>the Man</HI>; but perhaps this is the Fault of the Tran&s;lator. I have not the Original by me at pre&s;ent to determine it.</P>
<P>The Stanza at Line 475, is an In|&s;tance of what I have often remarked
<PB N="287" REF="311">
to be one great Point through the whole Work; and at Ver&s;e 635, we &s;ee it again.</P>
<P>Book v. I agree with you that no|thing can be more beautiful than the Grotto of <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> and the Environs; but Ver&s;e 177, I think, is a little ob|&s;cure; the frequent Repetition of the Word <HI>HE,</HI> without a Di&s;tinction, &s;eems to make it &s;o. It runs,
<Q>Go then he may; he mu&s;t, if HE ordain;</Q>
would it not have been better thus,
<Q>Go then he may; he mu&s;t, if JOVE ordain;</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay I am cavilling at Words, but I <HI>feel</HI> the Objection &s;trongly. I think too that calling <HI>Uly&s;&s;es the Man,</HI> Ver&s;e 186, is not &s;o well;
<PB N="288" REF="312">
would not <HI>the Prince,</HI> or <HI>the Chief,</HI> have done better?
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>294.</HI></BIBL>
Uly&s;&s;es rob'd him in the Cloack and Ve&s;t,</Q>
appears to me not particular enough.
There is &s;omething too incon&s;equential
for the Hero.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e. 311. Notwith&s;tanding all that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;aid in Defence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> being able to compleat his Boat in four Days Time, from the De&s;cription of it, I think it is hardly probable.</P>
<P>The Critics have been very &s;evere on the&s;e Words, "the well-fought Wall," Ver&s;e 395.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="313">You &s;ee, my Ob&s;ervations on this Book are rather employed in finding Faults, than di&s;covering Excellencies; and I really think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has made more E&s;capes herein, than in any I have read yet.</P>
<P>The Note upon Ver&s;e 454. is very fine, and merits particular Notice.</P>
<P>Book VI. is charming throughout. It gives us a delightful Picture of the Good-nature, Ho&s;pitality, paternal Af|fection, and Simplicity of the Manners of the Antients. Ver&s;e 247 and 248, perfectly agree wich the holy P&s;almi&s;t, where He &s;ays, "Who&s;o giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord." Pray re|turn to Ver&s;e 100. and read the Note
<PB N="290" REF="314">
on that Line, and the &s;ub&s;equent Note, and con&s;ider them carefully. The Man|ner of <HI>wa&s;hing</HI> ob&s;erved in the Former, is u&s;ual, at this Day, in many Places of Scotland, e&s;pecially when they wa&s;h what they call great Linen, as Sheets, Table-Cloths, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I thought, my Dear, I &s;hould have been able to get through a Book or Two more; for I find what is in the Notes, and what you have ob&s;erved will cut my Work very &s;hort; but your Letter is ju&s;t come to Hand, which I have read with va&s;t Plea&s;ure; only I think you go too fa&s;t through <HI>Rochefa|cault.</HI> I hope to have another from you &s;oon on that Subject.</P>

<P>The&s;e intere&s;ting Volumes had been publi&s;hed &s;carce|ly one Year, during which Period, be&s;ides a very ex|ten&s;ive Sale at home, four large Impre&s;&s;ions were cir|culated through Scotland, Ireland, France, and Ger|many. It has been generally allowed not unworthy a Situation in all Libraries, as a Supplement to Ri|chard&s;on's excellent Writings; and the Encourage|ment it has met plainly demon&s;trates the Approba|tion wherewith it has been read.</P>
<P>To this new Edition an explanatory Index is added by the Editor, who takes this Means of returning his &s;incere Thanks to the Public, for the indulgent Re|ception the Work has been favoured with, and a&s;&s;ures them every Care &s;hall be taken within his Ability, to render it &s;till more de&s;erving of their Attention.</P>

<Q>Mr. Baker, the Author of the&s;e Remarks, has pointed out a great Number of improper Expre&s;|&s;ions, which we frequently hear in Conver&s;ation, or meet with in Books; and has &s;ubjoined many u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations. <BIBL>CRITICAL REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>

<P>This little Tract has been in great E&s;timation for the&s;e Fifty Years pa&s;t&punc; and has gone thro' many Edi|tions in Ireland. The Remedies it pre&s;cribes are &s;imple, and ea&s;ily obtained, and never fail of a Cure, where the Di&s;order is curable; and no Man who va|lues his Hor&s;e, &s;hould pre&s;ume to travel without it.</P>
<P>ADVERTISEMENT.</P>
<P>It may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the Reader, that the&s;e Pre&s;criptions have not been ha&s;tily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many Books have been written on Farriery, of which <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>'s is undoubtedly the be&s;t, but his Rules are too tedious for the Pocket. Such a Book therefore as this, is nece&s;&s;ary on a journey, in order to refer to, as Occa&s;ion requires, and it contains as much as is known by any of our common Farriers.</P>
<P>As &s;mall as this Tract may appear, it will be found to inform Gentlemen, Fir&s;t, What Methods are be&s;t to be u&s;ed, if their Hor&s;es fall lame. Secondly, What Medicines are proper to give them when &s;ick. Third|ly, How to direct the Operations, and e&s;cape the Im|po&s;itions of ignorant Men. In &s;hort, by the Help of this Treati&s;e, Gentlemen will be able to prevent a Groom or Farrier from injuring their Hor&s;es, by im|proper Applications, and mi&s;taking one Di&s;temper for another.</P>
<P>The Receipts are few, naked and cheap: the Poul|tice but one, and contrived on purpo&s;e to prevent

Trouble, and &s;ave Time and Charges, by pointing out the be&s;t Remedies at fir&s;t, &s;uch as are ea&s;ie&s;t to be got, and &s;uch as make the &s;peedie&s;t Cures; and the Reader may be a&s;&s;ured they have been experimental|ly confirmed by a Practice of thirty Years. The Book is drawn up in a Manner calculated for a Gen|tleman's Pocket, &s;uppo&s;ing him upon a Journey; and no Man, who values his Hor&s;e &s;hould travel without it.</P>

<Q>The Author of this Work humbly pre&s;umes, that he has offered many con&s;iderable Improve|ments in the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Fencing,</HI> having founded his Principles on Nature, and confuted many fal&s;e Notions hitherto adopted by the mo&s;t eminent Ma&s;ters; he has rendered the Play &s;imple, and made it ea&s;y and plain, even to tho&s;e who were be|fore unacquainted with the Art. After bringing his Scholar as far as the A&s;&s;ault, and having de|mon&s;trated to him all the Thru&s;ts and various Pa|rades, he lays down Rules for Defence in all Sorts of <HI>Sword-Play.</HI></Q>

<P><PB REF="323">13. <HI>Price</HI> 1l. 5s. BELL's COMMON PLACE BOOK. Formed generally upon the Principles recommended and practi&s;ed by Mr. LOCKE.</P>
<P>This Work is elegantly executed from Copper Plates on Superfine Writing Demy Paper, and may be had of all the Book&s;ellers in England, by enqui|ring for Bell's Library Common-Place Book, formed upon Mr. Locke's Principles.</P>
<P>This Book is generally bound in Vellum, con|taining 5 Quires of the very be&s;t Demy Paper pro|perly prepared, for 1l. 5s.</P>

<Q>The Public is here pre&s;ented with a new Tran|&s;lation of that fine old Romance BARCLAY's AR|GENIS. The Original has been well known to the Learned the&s;e 150 Years; and for the Accomoda|tion of the mere Engli&s;h Readers, two Ver&s;ions of it, in our Language, were given in the Cour&s;e of the la&s;t Century; but the Style of the&s;e is grown too ob&s;olete for the pre&s;ent Age.</Q>
<Q>The Editor as &s;he chu&s;es to &s;tyle her&s;elf, rather than Tran&s;lator, has prefixed to the Work, a very judicious Account of the Author's De&s;ign, and of the Merit of his Performance: which is, as &s;he well ob&s;erves, A Romance, an Allegory, and a Sy&s;tem of Politics, Con&s;idered as an Inve&s;tigation of the various forms of Government, and of the mo&s;t proper remedies for the political Di&s;tempers of a State, it will certainly be thought a Work of great Merit, if we make due allowance for the time in which it was written. But if regarded only as a Work of moral Entertainment, it will be allowed to &s;tand in the foremo&s;t Rank of the old Romances, &s;acred to Chivalry and Virtue.

The Au|thor has re&s;tricted him&s;elf to the mo&s;t characteri|&s;tic De&s;criptions of each Vegetable, without &s;wel|ling his Work with a multiplicity of &s;ynonymous Names.

<Q>The Original of this Treati&s;e has already been tran&s;lated into a &s;everal Foreign Languages, it is here accurately rendered into Engli&s;h, and has de|&s;ervedly met with Approbation.

For though it is chiefly by practical Ob&s;ervations that both are to cultivate their Art, yet a competent Acquaintance with the ab&s;tract Elements of Science may prove the means of &s;ugge&s;ting u&s;eful Expedients, and often facilitate the Road to Practice. <BIBL>MONTLY REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>

<Q>This is a very u&s;eful Publication, particularly at the pre&s;ent Period, when the Nature of our Con&s;titution is &s;o much the Subject of Animad|ver&s;ion. The Author, together with the Origi|nal Charter, has given an Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation for the Benefit of his unlearned Readers, and a cir|cum&s;tantial Account of the manner in which this &s;acred Palladium of Engli&s;h Liberty was originally obtained from King John. He compleats the Whole, with an E&s;&s;ay on Parliaments from their Origin in England, and their half-yearly Exi|&s;tence, to their Septennial Duration, and di&s;plays no le&s;s an exten&s;ive Fund of Knowledge, than a laudable Exactne&s;s in the cour&s;e of his Relation.</Q>
