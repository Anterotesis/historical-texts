<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract from the PUBLIC ADVERTISER of Monday, November 22, 1773.</HEAD>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>ON Saturday la&s;t, a new comedy, called the Duelli&s;t, was performed, for the fir&s;t time, at Covent-Garden Theatre. Previous to the curtain being drawn up, the following written hand-bill was di&s;per&s;ed about the hou&s;e.</P>
<Q>Mr. Macklin has been pur&s;ued by a malicious party to &s;uch a pitch of rancour, that at la&s;t they have &s;ucceeded &s;o far in their cur&s;ed de&s;igns, as to get him di&s;charged this Theatre, and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood : There|fore if the Public have any &s;pirit, they will not &s;uffer the new play to begin till Mr. Colman pro|mi&s;es that Mr. Macklin &s;hall be engaged again.</Q>
<P>This hand-bill found its way into the Green-Room, and had a very vi&s;ible effect on the per|formers, as was plainly evident from their confu&s;ion. The piece was received with great marks of appro|bation, and given out again for Monday, which was attended with &s;ome hi&s;&s;ing, but that was greatly overpowered by the general applau&s;e of the audience. The overture to <HI>Thomas and Sally</HI> being attended to with &s;ilence, the greate&s;t part of the Author's Friends, quitted the Theatre ; which being taken advantage
<PB REF="4">
of by a party in the gallery, a riot en&s;ued ; and the entertainment was not &s;uffered to go on till another play was given out for Monday.</P></Q>
<P>To the above conci&s;e relation of the circum&s;tances attending the repre&s;entation of the following Comedy (as it is given by one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of our diurnal hi&s;torians) the Author of the Duelli&s;t makes no exception or addition. He would be wanting, however, in that re&s;pect, which he has ever profe&s;&s;ed and &s;hewn for the public opinion, did he not endea|vour to obviate &s;ome objections that have been made to his Piece, and to account, as well as he is able, for the unprecedented &s;everity of its treatment.</P>
<P>As to the author's preten&s;ions to merit in this &s;pe|cies of writing, it is not for him to boa&s;t, were there cau&s;e for boa&s;ting. Becau&s;e, &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;i|ty of a dramatic writer's making the theatre the con|&s;tant &s;cene of his ob&s;ervation, he can without morti|fication admit that an author, who&s;e &s;tudy is the &s;tage, bids fairer for &s;ucce&s;s on it than another, who, engaged at a di&s;tance in more &s;cientific re&s;earches, makes its amu&s;ements only his occa&s;ional relaxation from &s;everer and more laborious pur&s;uits. Not that he is without rea&s;on to be flattered with the applau&s;e his performance met with in repre&s;entation ; though, were it otherwi&s;e, he &s;hould not have the vanity to copy after a Corneille, who, in the preface to his Pertharite, which was univer&s;ally condemned, avows boldly, that in &s;pite of cen&s;ure his play was a good one and well written. He would have confidence
<PB REF="5">
enough, however, in imitation of as great a writer of our own country, to declare, with Dryden, that the town "had received with applau&s;e, as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men." As a writer by profe&s;&s;ion, therefore, who&s;e family depends on his indu&s;try, he conceives it not only prudential in him to convert his amu&s;ements to profit, but that he has a right to expect the theatres &s;hould be as open to receive his productions as tho&s;e of others. It is true, he has not found it &s;o, and is &s;ingularly un|lucky in having his pieces performed with impartial applau&s;e, and then partially bani&s;hed the &s;tage. He is not a&s;hamed to declare he writes plays not from in|clination but from expediency : the object in his view being not dramatic reputation but theatrical emolu|ment ; to which, while he writes no wor&s;e than others (which can hardly be) though it &s;hould not be allowed he writes better, he pre&s;umes he is equally entitled.</P>
<P>To account for his di&s;appointment in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance will not be difficult. Some ju&s;t exceptions may be made to the piece it&s;elf : the &s;cene between the lawyers in the fourth act appeared too long ; in deference however to the opinion of Mr. Colman, who thought its effect would depend greatly on the action, it was ri&s;ked, and is here printed at length.</P>
<P>As to the pa&s;&s;age objected to, on account of its &s;uppo&s;ed indelicacy, it is entirely omitted. The author mu&s;t do Mr. Colman, al&s;o the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he con&s;tantly excepted again&s;t it, and had his
<PB REF="6">
more cautious judgement been attended to, it would have been omitted in the repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Another exception has been made to the whole of the repre&s;entation, on account of the confu&s;ion, I might &s;ay di&s;tre&s;s, of &s;ome of the performers. But if the circum&s;tances that cau&s;ed it be attended to, &s;uch performers were &s;o far from being the objects of reprehen&s;ion for playing ill, that it is a wonder they acquitted them&s;elves &s;o well.</P>
<P>To Mr. Macklin the author has nothing, nor ever will have any thing, farther to &s;ay, than that he im|putes the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this unfortunate comedy whol|ly to that performer's re&s;entment again&s;t the mana|gers, for having di&s;charged him the theatre ; as it was doubtle&s;s their duty to do at the requi&s;ition of the the majority of an audience. That ill-&s;ucce&s;s, in|deed has been imputed to cau&s;es, which to admit, would be to ca&s;t an injurious reflection on per&s;ons, who, the author is well per&s;uaded, by no means de|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the gentlemen of the law took offence at the liberties taken with their profe&s;&s;ion and practice, in the characters and dialogue of Wit|more and Nonplus. They mu&s;t have too much knowledge and good &s;en&s;e, however, to be &s;eriou&s;ly offended at what was de&s;igned as a mere laugh on the &s;tage, or a &s;atire on what the be&s;t of them regret as much as their clients, without having it in their power to remedy it.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">A club of book&s;ellers and a crew of authors are &s;aid to have formed a formidable phalanx of oppo&s;ition. The writer doubts not the good in|tentions of both ; he has endeavoured to &s;erve the cau&s;e of literature too much, to have the good will of tho&s;e, who are labouring, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to ruin it. What injury either party might do him in the theatre, the author knows not ; but the &s;cribblers have &s;hewn &s;o little di&s;cretion in the zeal to abu&s;e him from the pre&s;s, that he gives them hearty thanks for the &s;ervice they have unde|&s;ignedly done him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Individuals it has been mi&s;taken|ly, or perhaps maliciou&s;ly, propagated that the piece was calculated to ridicule per&s;ons or charac|ters, for whom the author has either the greate&s;t re&s;pect, or to whom he is an entire &s;tranger. They who read Mr. Fielding's Amelia will &s;ee from what &s;ource the author has drawn &s;ome of the principal characters and incidents. As the re&s;t of the piece is original, the candid mu&s;t al&s;o admit that he has made no greater u&s;e of that writer than dramatic authors have ever been allowed to do with novel|i&s;ts, from the practice of Shake&s;pear to that of Mr. Colman.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that Mr. Garrick had pri|vately planted a party in the hou&s;e to oppo&s;e the performance. This the author cannot believe ; as, having long &s;ince declared him&s;elf that gentle|man's open and avowed enemy, he cannot, after
<PB REF="8">
what has publickly pa&s;&s;ed between them, think &s;o meanly even of Mr. Garrick as to &s;uppo&s;e he would act otherwi&s;e than as an enemy equally open and avowed.</P>
<P>It has even been &s;aid that the friends of a certain dramati&s;t, who&s;e name the author forbears to mention, as it is di&s;gu&s;ting to the remembrance of his friends, were powerful in the oppo&s;ition. On this head he will only give a little anecdote, as it was related to him by an auditor, who &s;at in the Boxes.</P>
<P>"During the tumult in the theatre about the re|petition of the Duelli&s;t, a Lady who a&s;ked a thing that had the appearance of a gentleman, what was the rea&s;on of it, was an&s;wered that "the <HI>Man</HI> (meaning the author) was obnoxious and therefore his piece mu&s;t be condemned." "Yes, madam," added a gentleman who &s;at by, "There are a mul|titude of animals in this town, to whom the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of a MAN is as <HI>obnoxious</HI> as the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of a WOMAN."&mdash;May the author of the Duelli&s;t be ever obnoxious to &s;uch Critics.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it has been urged, that the Author had not friends enough in the hou&s;e to &s;upport the piece. If by this is meant that the piece had not merit enough to make it&s;elf friends, it is fal&s;e, as appears from the above-cited relation. While its friends remained in the hou&s;e, it was applauded by a great majority ; but, when a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e went away, and their places were &s;upplied by riotous partizans,
<PB REF="9">
who could not before get into the hou&s;e and had not &s;een it, it is no wonder that both the piece and the author &s;hould fatally feel the want of friends.</P>
<P>If this want, on the other hand, be imputed to the Author's neglect of introducing people into the theatre, to influence the judgment of the impartial part of the audience in his favour, he takes a pride in having ever paid in this re&s;pect a proper defe|rence to the Public ; whom he &s;hould think he in|&s;ulted, had he acted otherwi&s;e, and made <HI>per&s;onal intere&s;t</HI> to &s;upport his preten&s;ions to <HI>literary merit.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Too proud to beg, too mode&s;t to demand,</L>
<L>By merit only would he fall or &s;tand ;</L>
<L>Nor enmity, nor friend&s;hip interfering,</L>
<L>He only a&s;ks a fair and candid hearing.</L>
<BIBL>Prol. to the Widow'd Wife.</BIBL></Q>
<P>This indeed is cruelly denied him, by the inter|ruption of his play ; but he hopes will not be &s;o on a future occa&s;ion ; the Author having another piece accepted at the &s;ame theatre ; the parts of which being already written out, and the whole ready for rehear&s;al, he doubts not the Manager will give him an early opportunity of repairing the lo&s;s, attending his pre&s;ent di&s;appointment : Indeed he &s;till places &s;o much confidence on the ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity of the Public, as to &s;latter him&s;elf he &s;hall not ultimately &s;uffer by tru&s;ting, without party or cabal, to the candour and impartiality of his Auditors.</P>

<P>Really, George, your &s;ituation is &s;o critical that I am not lawyer enough to advi&s;e you. Sir Solomon, your father-in-law, &s;till &s;o inflexible, &s;ay you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As po&s;itivene&s;s and par&s;imony can make him. It is not above two years &s;ince I married ; and, notwith&s;tanding every proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on my part, the earne&s;t and repeated &s;olicitations of his daughter, and the warme&s;t interce&s;&s;ions of our friends, he &s;till &s;eems inexorable as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's &s;trange! Time generally &s;oftens re&s;entments of this kind. But the love of money, and an habitual pa&s;&s;ion for artificial trifles, extingui&s;h the &s;parks of natural affection. As I have acquired, however &s;ome credit with him, I will try, when he comes to town, how far my influence extends. And yet, Boothby, this may be carrying my friend&s;hip for you too far.</P>

<P>Why, really I do think &s;eriou&s;ly of her &s;ometimes.

<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but under&s;tand me, General. If you have taken up any cau&s;e of mine, I am &s;o far from re&s;enting it as an injury, that I think my&s;elf obliged to you. You know I am as tenacious of the punctilio as your&s;elf ; and would never be &s;o rude as to take up the cau&s;e of a &s;tranger : but among friends it is quite another thing.</P>

<P>Right, boy. When I commanded in Ireland, my doublet was pinked like the flounces of a fine lady's &s;ilk petticoat ; and all in the cau&s;e of my friends. The man who would not be run through the body for his friend, ought to be kicked out of the world for a &s;coundrel.</P>

Now let me &s;ee. [reads]
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Capt. Boothby &mdash;</HEAD>
<P>If Captain Boothby would prevent his wife's ruin and pre&s;erve his own honour, he will hinder her going to the ma&s;querade with Lord Lovemore, or when there will mo&s;t carefully watch the behaviour of his Lord&s;hip.</P>
</LETTER>
The hand-writing is a woman's, and re&s;embles that of Lady Lovemore ; but it cannot be hers&mdash;&s;he is to accompany my wife, and therefore would hardly di&s;&s;uade me from letting her go. Be&s;ides, &s;he &s;eems not to have the lea&s;t tincture of jealou&s;y in her di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;Yet now I reflect ; come this notice from whom it will, it may not be proper to neglect it. Mrs. Boothby's conduct is my&s;terious. Her re&s;entment la&s;t night at Lord Love|more's was unaffected and natural. And, though the pa&s;&s;ed off the matter &s;lightly to day, the manner in which &s;he did it was neither ea&s;y nor natural&mdash;There may be &s;omething more in this bu&s;ine&s;s than I am aware of. I will take Mrs. Boothby to ta&s;k roundly for her re&s;erve. I'll make her believe I know more than I do, that &s;he may tell me more than I know. &mdash; Here &s;he comes.
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mrs. BOOTHBY.</HI></STAGE>
Come hither madam. I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you&mdash;but fir&s;t let me &s;hut the door.</P>

<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is madam. Tell me, Mrs. Boothby [taking her ha&s;tily by the hand] and tell me truly, as you value my fu|ture quiet and your own happine&s;s, have you dealt fairly by me?</P>

<P>Nay, call not Heaven to witne&s;s a fal&s;ehood&mdash; You have deceived me Mrs. Boothby&mdash;You have treacherou&s;ly concealed from me a &s;ecret, which I ought to have known, and which, had I not by other means di&s;covered it, might have proved our ruin.</P>

<P>Of what fal&s;ehood? What deceit? What treachery have I been guilty?</P>

<P>You told me to day, that you thought Lord Lovemore meant nothing by the behaviour you re&s;ented la&s;t night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unkind Mr. Boothby! did not you your|&s;elf &s;ay every thing to per&s;uade me &s;o? Did you not &s;ay that gratitude for the obligations his Lord&s;hip &s;ought to confer on us, required the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction to be put on his actions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obligations, madam! had he laid obligations on me till he had rai&s;ed pile to reach the &s;kies, the favour he &s;ought to confer by your means, would have tumbled them all down, and buried them in oblivion. &mdash;It is in vain to conceal It any longer. This letter, this letter, madam, has given me damnable intimations of the favours intended us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all my hopes of happine&s;s, both here and hereafter, I declare I have concealed nothing from you, but out of motives of the mo&s;t &s;incere fidelity and affec|tionate tenderne&s;s. I knew you to be &s;o jealous of your honour, that I dreaded the fatal con&s;equences of telling you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not you, madam, equally jealous of my honour, that out of &s;uch mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s for my per&s;onal
<PB N="59" REF="71">
&s;afety, you would betray the mo&s;t invaluable trea&s;ure of my &s;oul? I Would you from &s;o weak a motive &s;ubject me to be pointed at as the credulous dupe, the ea&s;y fool, the wittol of a titled ra&s;cal whom I care&s;s as a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, indeed you wrong me, Mr. Boothby. Heaven forbid I &s;hould be put to the trial ; but I think I could. &s;acrifice every thing I hold mo&s;t dear to the pre&s;ervation of your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As far as it is dependent on your fidelity, you may think it &s;afe. The wor&s;t even a bad woman can do is to make her&s;elf ridiculous, it is on her&s;elf only that &s;he can entail infamy. But men of honour, madam, have a degree of it to maintain, &s;uperior to that which is in a woman's keeping.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will my&s;elf, madam, be the guardian both of my own honour and of yours. I have before told you a woman's be&s;t confidant is her hu&s;band.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you then promi&s;e to command your temper, and not be urged by that of others to violence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then will I po&s;itively confide in you ; and &s;hould his Lord&s;hip make any farther advances, acquaint you with it. And now, my dear, let me know the contents of that letter.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is her hand&mdash;though purpo&s;ely di&s;|gui&s;ed &mdash;I am &s;ure of it. I was before this almo&s;t tempted to

<P>By all means; we cannot with any kind of de|cency break the appointment without breaking at once with Lord Lovemore ; which neither good manners nor prudence will yet ju&s;tify.</P>

How loo&s;e are the principles of men of intrigue!

Oh! Mrs. Goodwill! if General Gantlet &s;hould return I have a little plot upon him, which you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me in.

<P>Egad, General, I believe you had better think of a prudent expedition to the continent. You acted the part of a man, it &s;eems, &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly with your antagoni&s;t ye&s;terday, that you &s;hould be careful how you play the fool to night. I under&s;tand he lies at the point of death.</P>

<P>By heavens, this is not to be put up with. Bedizen'd like a &s;trumpet, dogg'd by thief-takers, dragged along like a &s;treet-walker! &mdash;Capt. Boothby, I mu&s;t have &s;atisfaction for all this ; I under&s;tand it was a plot of yours and my lady &s;i&s;ter's, to expo&s;e me. As to her, &s;he is a woman, and I'll have nothing more to do with petticoats.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, General, I a&s;k your pardon with all my heart. But I acted in concert with Lady Lovemore merely to &s;et this &s;avage cu&s;tom of duelling, you are &s;o ab|&s;urdly fond of, in a ridiculous light.</P>

<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, I feel my&s;elf ridiculous enough in all con&s;cience. But my dignity, Boothby!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, General! Doth dignity con&s;i&s;t in the brutal cu&s;tom of cutting throats, like cannibals, in cold

blood ? Did the heroes of antiquity want dignity? Yet did Cae&s;ar ever &s;end a challenge to Cato, or Cato to Cae&s;ar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cae&s;ar and Cato, Boothby, were clever fellows, in their day, no doubt. Yes, your Cae&s;ars and Catos mu&s;t have been fine fellows in there time. But &s;word and pi&s;tol were not then in vogue, and the fight|ing one's friends was not come in fa&s;hion. You may call me ab&s;urd, if you will ; but how is a man of honour at pre&s;ent to &s;upport his con&s;equence without having recour&s;e to the Duel ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By having recour&s;e to his good-nature, my dear General : Believe me, there is often more fortitude in forgiv|ing an injury than in revenging it ; and always more dignity in de&s;pi&s;ing in&s;ults than in re&s;enting them.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Writen by the AUTHOR,</BYLINE>
<P>And &s;poken by Mi&s;s BARSANTI.</P>
<SP>
<L>WELL, men of valour! how do ye like our play?</L>
<L>Nothing again&s;t it, &s;ure, the Ladies &s;ay! &mdash;</L>
<L>To own they're pleas'd the critics ever loth,</L>
<L>May cry "A Duelli&s;t with &s;carce an oath!</L>
<L>"'Tis like his hat, that was without a feather. &mdash;</L>
<L>"Duels and dammes, always go together."</L>
<L>Old &s;inners, loving the licentious joke,</L>
<L>May think there wants too here and there a &s;troke ;</L>
<L>Round oaths and double meanings, &s;trew'd between,</L>
<L>With them the virtues of the comic &s;cene.</L>
<L>And yet the Town in general is &s;o nice,</L>
<L>It holds the&s;e virtues as a kind of vice.</L>
<L>From the teeth outwards cha&s;te, their hands before 'em,</L>
<L>Like reps, ev'n demireps are all decorum.</L>
<L>Though gro&s;s their thoughts, &s;o delicate their hearing,</L>
<L>They think the very &s;tage &s;hould fine for &s;wearing.</L>
<L>Our author, therefore, &s;crupled to employ</L>
<L>Your vulgar <HI>damme Sir,</HI> and <HI>damme boy</HI>;</L>
<L>Nay, when by chance a naughty joke came pat in,</L>
<L>He wrapt it up, you know, in lawyer's Latin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to a pa&s;&s;age in the play, which the Author, in deference to the delicacy of certain Ladies, who under&s;tand Latin, has omitted.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>So much refin'd the &s;cene &s;ince former days,</L>
<L>When Congreve, Vanbrugh, Wycherly wrote plays,</L>
<L><PB REF="94" MS="y">"The &s;tage &s;o loo&s;ely did A&s;trea tread,</L>
<L>"She fairly put all characters to bed ;</L>
<L>Tho' now no bard would venture to depo&s;it</L>
<L>A Macaroni in a lady's clo&s;et ;</L>
<L>Le&s;t the &s;rail fair one he be thought to ruin,</L>
<L>While moon and &s;tars alone&mdash;&s;ee what they're doing.</L>
<L>In the old plays, gallants take no denial,</L>
<L>But put the &s;truggling actre&s;s to the trial.</L>
<L>B1e&s;s me! I &s;hudder ev'n now to think</L>
<L>How near ev'n I may &s;tand on dangers brink.</L>
<L>In modern plays, more &s;afe the female &s;tation ;</L>
<L>Secure as &s;ad our &s;olemn &s;ituation!</L>
<L>No raki&s;h, forward &s;park dares now be rude :</L>
<L>The Comic Mu&s;e her&s;elf grown quite a prude!</L>
<L>No wonder then, if, in &s;o pure an age,</L>
<L>No <HI>Congreves</HI> write for as demure a &s;tage.</L>
