<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <HI>JOHN,</HI> EARL OF <HI>ORRERY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have no other Pretence to the Honour of a Patronage, &s;o illu&s;|trious as that of your Lord&s;hip, than
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the Merit of attempting what has by &s;ome unaccountable Neglect been hitherto omitted, though ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a perfect Knowledge of the Abilities of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Powers that mu&s;t con|duce to con&s;titute a Poet, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t valuable is Invention; and of all the Degrees of Invention, the high|e&s;t &s;eems to be that which is able to produce a Series of Events. It is ea&s;y when the Thread of a Story is once drawn to diver&s;ify it with Variety of Colours; and when a Train of Action is pre&s;ented to the Mind, a little Ac|quaintance with Life will &s;upply Cir|cum&s;tances and Reflexions, and a lit|tle Knowledge of Books, furni&s;h Pa|rallels and Illu&s;trations. To tell over again a Story that has been told already,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
and to tell it better than the fir&s;t Author is no rare Qualification; but to &s;trike out the fir&s;t Hints of a new Fable; hence to introduce a Set of Charac|ters &s;o diver&s;ified in their &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ions and Intere&s;ts, that from the cla&s;hing of this Variety may re&s;ult many nece&s;&s;ary Incidents; to make the&s;e Incidents &s;urpri&s;ing, and yet natural, &s;o as to delight the Imagina|tion without &s;hocking the Judgment of a Reader; and finally, to wind up the whole in a plea&s;ing Cata&s;trophe produced by tho&s;e very Means which &s;eem mo&s;t likely to oppo&s;e and pre|vent it, is the utmo&s;t Effort of the human Mind.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover how few of tho&s;e Writers, who profe&s;s to recount ima|ginary Adventures, have been able to
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
produce any Thing by their own Ima|gination would require too much of that Time, which your Lord&s;hip employs in nobler Studies. Of all the Novels and Romances that Wit or Idlene&s;s, Vanity or Indigence, have pu&s;hed into the World, there are very few, of which the End can|not be conjectured from the Begin|ning; or where the Authors have done more, than to tran&s;po&s;e the In|cidents of other Tales, or &s;trip the Circum&s;tances from one Event for the Decoration of another.</P>
<P>In the Examination of a Poet's Character it is therefore fir&s;t to be en|quired what Degree of Invention has been exerted by him. With this View I have very diligently read the Works of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and now pre&s;ume to
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
lay the Re&s;ult of my Searches before your Lord&s;hip, before that Judge whom <HI>Pliny</HI> him&s;elf would have wi&s;hed for his A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to hear a lite|rary Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>How much the Tran&s;lation of the following Novels will add to the Re|putation of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> or take away from it, You, my Lord, and Men learned and candid like You, if any &s;uch can be found, mu&s;t now de|termine. Some Danger, as I am in|formed, there is, le&s;t his Admirers &s;hould think him injured by this At|tempt, and clamour as at the Dimi|nution of the Honour of that Nati|on, which boa&s;ts her&s;elf the Parent of &s;o great a Poet.</P>
<P>That no &s;uch Enemies may ari&s;e a|gain&s;t me (though I am unwilling
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to believe it) I am far from being too confident, for who can fix Bounds to Bigotry and Folly? My <HI>Sex,</HI> my <HI>Age,</HI> have not given me many Opportunities of mingling in the World; there may be in it many a Species of Ab&s;urdity which I have never &s;een, and among them &s;uch Vanity as plea&s;es it&s;elf with fal&s;e Prai&s;e be&s;towed on another, and &s;uch Super&s;tition as wor&s;hips Idols, without &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Gods.</P>
<P>But the Truth is, that a very &s;mall Part of the Reputation of this mighty Genius depends upon the naked Plot, or Story of his Plays. He liv|ed in an Age when the Books of Chivalry were yet popular, and when therefore the Minds of his Auditors were not accu&s;tomed to balance Pro|babilities, or to examine nicely the
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
Proportion between Cau&s;es and Ef|fects. It was &s;ufficient to recom|mend a Story, that it was far removed from common Life, that its Chang|es were frequent, and its Clo&s;e pa|thetic.</P>
<P>This Di&s;po&s;ition of the Age con|curred &s;o happily with the Imaginati|on of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> that he had no De|&s;ire to reform it, and indeed to this he was indebted for the licentious Va|riety, by which he has made his Plays more entertaining than tho&s;e of any other Author.</P>
<P>He had looked with great Atten|tion on the Scenes of Nature; but his chief Skill was in Human Acti|ons, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Habits; he was therefore delighted with &s;uch Tales as afforded numerous Incidents, and
<PB N="x" REF="9">
exhibited many Characters, in many Changes of Situation. The&s;e Cha|racters are &s;o copiou&s;ly diver&s;ified, and &s;ome of them &s;o ju&s;tly pur&s;ued, that his Works may be con&s;idered as a Map of Life, a faithful Miniature of human Tran&s;actions, and he that has read <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with Attention, will perhaps find little new in the crouded World.</P>
<P>Among his other Excellencies it ought to be remarked, becau&s;e it has hitherto been unnoticed, that his <HI>Heroes are Men,</HI> that the Love and Hatred, the Hopes and Fears of his chief Per&s;onages are &s;uch as are com|mon to other human Beings, and not like tho&s;e which later Times have exhibited, peculiar to Phantoms that &s;trut upon the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">It is not perhaps very nece&s;&s;ary to enquire whether the Vehicle of &s;o much Delight and In&s;truction be a Story probable, or unlikely, native, or foreign. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Excellence is not the Fiction of a Tale, but the Re|pre&s;entation of Life; and his Repu|tation is therefore &s;afe, till Human Nature &s;hall be changed. Nor can he who has &s;o many ju&s;t Claims to Prai&s;e, &s;uffer by lo&s;ing that which ignorant Admiration has unrea&s;onably given him. To calumniate the Dead is Ba&s;ene&s;s, and to flatter them is &s;urely Folly.</P>
<P>From Flattery, my Lord, either of the Dead or the Living, I wi&s;h to be clear, and have therefore &s;oli|cited the Countenance of a Patron, whom, if I knew how to prai&s;e
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
him, I could prai&s;e with Truth, and have the World on my Side; who&s;e Candour and Humanity are univer&s;ally acknowledged, and who&s;e Judgment perhaps was then fir&s;t to be doubted, when he conde&s;cended to admit this Addre&s;s from,</P>

<P>_THE <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was at the Heighth of it's Grandeur and Power, when <HI>Maximine,</HI> a great and virtuous Prince, reigned over it; this Emperor, who de&s;ired no|thing more ardently, than the Welfare and Hap|pine&s;s of all his Subjects, was extremely nice in the Choice of tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom he deputed to govern the Provinces dependant on the Em|pire, a&s;&s;igning tho&s;e Employments only to Men who&s;e Integrity and Virtue were well known to him.</P>

<P><PB N="2" REF="17">It happened, that the Government of <HI>In|&s;pruck,</HI> a rich and populous City, became va|cant, which the Emperor re&s;olved to be&s;tow upon one of his Officers, named <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> a Man who&s;e Fidelity he had often experienced, having been &s;everal Years near his Per&s;on, and, during that Time, had behaved with &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Prudence, that he had conceived a great E&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>Having taken this Re&s;olution in Favour of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> he ordered his Attendance one Day in his Clo&s;et, and &s;poke to him as follows.</P>
<P>"<HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> the good Opinion I have con|ceived of you, from the Manner in which you have behaved your&s;elf, &s;ince you have been in my Service, has determined me to be|&s;tow the Government of <HI>In&s;pruck</HI> upon you. I might give you many Directions for your Conduct in this high Employment, but I &s;hall confine them all to this one: Do Ju&s;|tice to all Per&s;ons without any Di&s;tinction; let this be the Rule and Guide of all your Actions. Other Faults, which either through Negligence or Ignorance, you may hap|pen to commit, I po&s;&s;ibly may excu&s;e; but any Act of Inju&s;tice I will never par|don. Since it is not given to every Man to be able to practi&s;e all the Virtues, if you are con&s;cious of any Defect in your Temper, which may incline you to act with le&s;s Im|partiality than I require, do not accept of this Government, but continue here in my Court, where your Services are very agree|able to me, and do not lay me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing what will be very pain|ful
<PB N="3" REF="18">
to me, which is the puni&s;hing you &s;eve|rely for any Act again&s;t Ju&s;tice, and there|by acquitting what I my&s;elf owe to it."</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who was greatly plea&s;ed with the honourable Employment the Emperor had be|&s;towed upon him, thanked his Maje&s;ty for it with much Submi&s;&s;ion: "Doubt not, my gra|cious Lord, added he, but that I will mo&s;t exactly perform what you require, and bend my whole Thoughts towards the Pre&s;ervation of Ju&s;tice, and &s;o much the more will I make it my continual Study, as your Words have kindled a glorious Emulation in my Soul, to de&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, not your Approbation only, but your Prai&s;es."</P>
<P>"It is well, &s;aid the Emperor, much plea&s;ed with this Reply; if your Actions are as good as your Words I &s;hall indeed have great Cau&s;e to prai&s;e you;" then ordering the Letters Patent to be made out, he inve&s;ted <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> with full Authority in his Government, and &s;ent him away immediately to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> as &s;oon as he arrived at <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> applied him&s;elf with great Diligence to the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, not only in rewarding Virtue and puni&s;hing Vice, but in filling all the inferior Po&s;ts and Offices with Men of ap|proved Virtue and Wi&s;dom; &s;o that by this Conduct he increa&s;ed the Emperor's E&s;teem of him, and acquired the Love of all the In|habitants of <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI></P>
<P>In the heighth of his Reputation for Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, it happened that a young Man, named <HI>Lodovico,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> ra|vi&s;hed
<PB N="4" REF="19">
a young Maid of the &s;ame City; her Relations complaining to <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> of this Injury, he ordered <HI>Lodovico</HI> to be &s;eized, and carried to Pri&s;on, who confe&s;&s;ing the Fact, was, ac|cording to a Law in force there, condemned to lo&s;e his Head.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Youth had a Si&s;ter, named <HI>Epitia,</HI> a Virgin of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Beauty, and but ju&s;t entered into her &s;ixteenth Year; Na|ture had not only been lavi&s;h in the Graces &s;he had be&s;towed on her Form, but endowed her al&s;o with a mo&s;t excellent Under&s;tanding, which had been well improved by the Study of Philo&s;ophy, her Father having &s;pared no Expence in the Education of his Children.</P>
<P>This Sentence gave great Affliction to <HI>E|pitia,</HI> who loved her Brother with the mo&s;t tender Affection; reflecting however, that her Sorrow was of no U&s;e to her Brother, &s;he re|&s;trained her Tears, and took a Re&s;olution to attempt &s;omething to deliver him.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e &s;he &s;ent to intreat an Au|dience of the Governor, which being granted, &s;he appeared before him, and throwing her&s;elf at his Feet, thus &s;poke to him.</P>
<P>"I come, my Lord, to implore your Com|pa&s;&s;ion for my Brother, my only Brother, who, though he has indeed incurred the Sentence of the Law, yet, through your milder Ju&s;tice, will, I hope, find it miti|gated: Reflect, my Lord, I be&s;eech you, on his early Youth, his Inexperience in Life, and the Force of that unhappy Pa&s;|&s;ion, which cau&s;ed his Crime; reflect al&s;o that his Crime, though great, is not a com|plicated
<PB N="5" REF="20">
one; the Honour of no Hu&s;band has been injured by it; the violated Virgin is the only Per&s;on who has been wronged; and her Wrong my Brother is willing to repair, by making her his Wife. I know the Law ordains, that the Ravi&s;her, although willing to marry the injured Maid, &s;hall never|thele&s;s die for the Offence he has commit|ted; yet I cannot think, my Lord, that the Makers of this hard Law de&s;igned it to be fulfilled in the very Letter of it; Ju&s;tice over|&s;trained is no longer Ju&s;tice but Cruelty; the Boundaries of Right and Wrong are &s;o near, that whoever reaches the Extremity of the one, is in Danger of invading the Borders of the other; if the Exce&s;s of Virtue be Vice, the Exce&s;s of Ju&s;tice is Cruelty; Mercy is as much the Attribute of Hea|ven as Ju&s;tice: Here then I be&s;eech you, let them be united; puni&s;h my Brother for his Offence, but let that Puni&s;hment fall &s;hort of Death, and do not let loo&s;e upon him all the Rigour of a Law, that was, perhaps, rather made to in&s;pire Terror, than to be exactly executed; let your Wi&s;dom cor|rect it's Severity; you who&s;e delegated Power is our living Law; and puni&s;h not by Death a Crime, which may be better repaired by Life."</P>
<P>The beautiful <HI>Epitia</HI> ended here; and tho&s;e Tears which, while &s;he was &s;peaking, &s;he had with Difficulty re&s;trained, now falling fa&s;t down her fair Face, Sorrow gave &s;o langui&s;h|ing a Sweetne&s;s to her Countenance, that <HI>Ju|ri&s;te</HI> &s;tood like one entranced, his Ears eagerly
<PB N="6" REF="21">
taking in the Mu&s;ic of her Accents, while his Eyes wandered o'er all the enchanting Beauties of her Form; and that he might the longer in|dulge the Plea&s;ure he felt in hearing and &s;eeing her, he obliged her to repeat her former Argu|ments in her Brother's Favour. <HI>Epitia</HI> drawing a good Omen from this Willingne&s;s in the Go|vernor to hear her Pleas, added many other Per&s;ua&s;ions to tho&s;e &s;he had already u&s;ed to pro|cure her Brother's Pardon, the Hope &s;he be|gan to entertain giving new Grace and Vigour to her Words.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> wholly &s;ubdued by the Charms of her Per&s;on, and the uncommon Strength of her Under&s;tanding, in a Youth &s;o blooming, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to win her to his De&s;ires, and commit the &s;ame Fault with her, for which he had condemned her Brother to die.</P>
<P>After pau&s;ing a little, as if reflecting upon what &s;he had &s;aid, <HI>Epitia,</HI> &s;aid he, your Ar|guments have &s;o far prevailed upon me, that, whereas your Brother, according to the Sen|tence of the Law, was to lo&s;e his Head to|morrow, I will defer his Execution till I have well con&s;idered what you have urged on his Behalf; and if I find your Rea&s;ons convincing, I will pardon him; and &s;o much the more willingly will I do it, as I &s;hould have been afflicted to have puni&s;hed him with that Rigour the Law requires. <HI>Epitia,</HI> full of the plea&s;ing Hope the&s;e Words in&s;pired, thanked him with much Submi&s;&s;ion, telling him, &s;he hoped to find him no le&s;s merciful in, giving her Bro|ther Pardon, than he had been kind in po&s;t|poning the Execution of the Sentence; and
<PB N="7" REF="22">
added, that &s;he was per&s;uaded, if he would con&s;ider what &s;he had &s;aid, he would find Rea|&s;ons &s;ufficient to induce him to &s;et her Bro|ther at Liberty. <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> replied, he would fully con&s;ider of it, and would not fail to comply with her Solicitations, provided he could do it without offending Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Epitia,</HI> greatly plea&s;ed with her Succe&s;s, took Leave of the Governor, and went to the Pri&s;on to vi&s;it her Brother, to whom &s;he rela|ted all that had pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> and her, and a&s;&s;ured him &s;he did not doubt but &s;he &s;hould obtain his Pardon.</P>
<P>The unhappy Youth received this News with Tran&s;port, and earne&s;tly begged his Si&s;|ter to renew her Vi&s;it to the Governor, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to know his Re&s;olution, which &s;he promi&s;ing, they parted, each full of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Expectations.</P>
<P>At the End of three Days &s;he returned to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> and with a graceful Sweetne&s;s, de|manded to know what he had re&s;olved concern|ing her Brother. This &s;econd Sight of the charming Maid added Fuel to the unlawful Flames of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who, after gazing on her pa&s;&s;ionately for &s;ome Moments, took her Hand, and thus replied.</P>
<P>Lovely <HI>Epitia,</HI> I have not failed to con&s;ider all the Arguments you u&s;ed in your Brother's Favour, and have al&s;o diligently &s;ought for others, to enforce them, that I might be able to comply with your Reque&s;t, but I find all are in&s;ufficient, and your Brother is con|demned, not only by a particular, but a uni|ver&s;al Law, &s;ince he knowingly and wilfully
<PB N="8" REF="23">
committed a Crime, the Puni&s;hment of which he knew to be Death; his Guilt therefore ad|mits of no Extenuation; and notwith&s;tanding the earne&s;t De&s;ire I have to plea&s;e you, I mu&s;t deliver him up to the Rigour of that Law he has offended: There is indeed one Way, and but one Way, by which you may &s;ave your Brother; I love you, charming <HI>Epitia,</HI> give me Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Per&s;on, and I will change your Brother's Sentence to a Puni&s;hment le&s;s than Death; if you love him you will not &s;cruple to make this &s;mall Sacrifice to &s;ave his Life, which I am re&s;olved not to &s;pare on any other Terms.</P>
<P>The fair Face of <HI>Epitia,</HI> which, at the Be|ginning of this Speech, had been over&s;pread with a languid Palene&s;s, glowed with a ro&s;y Blu&s;h at the infamous Conclu&s;ion; her Eyes, which had been filled with Tears, now darted forth Rays of mingled Rage and Di&s;dain, and that &s;weet Voice, that before only uttered the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Accents, was now changed to a &s;evere and haughty Tone.</P>
<P>"My Brother's Life, &s;aid &s;he, with a noble Fiercene&s;s, is indeed very dear to me, but my Honour is far dearer; my Life I would wil|lingly lo&s;e to &s;ave his, but I will not pre&s;erve him with the Lo&s;s of my Honour; quit then the&s;e unworthy Thoughts, and if you can pardon my Brother, make that Benefit &s;uch a Gift, as you without Di&s;honour may be&s;tow, and I without Infamy receive."</P>
<P>"I have already told you, replied <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> the Terms upon which I will con&s;ent to re|lea&s;e your Brother, nor ought you to think
<PB N="9" REF="24">
them hard or di&s;honourable, &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible I may be &s;o charmed with your generous Com|pliance, that I may afterwards make you my Wife."</P>
<P>"This improbable Hope, replied <HI>Epitia,</HI> &s;hall not delude me, I will not even bring my Ho|nour into Danger." "Why &s;hould you &s;o in|juriou&s;ly doubt the Efficacy of your own Charms? replied <HI>Juri&s;te</HI>; there is nothing more likely than that I &s;hall marry you; go then, and con&s;ider of my Propo&s;al, and to|morrow I will expect your An&s;wer."</P>

<P>Saying this, he left her; and <HI>Epitia</HI> finding there was nothing more to be expected from him, oppre&s;&s;ed with inconceivable Angui&s;h, went to the Pri&s;on, and related to her Brother all that had pa&s;t between her and the Governor; then melting into Tears, &s;he conjured him to &s;ubmit patiently to an Evil, which his own ill Fortune, or a &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity, had brought upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25">The unhappy Youth bur&s;t into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion of Grief at this cruel and unexpected News, and not able to bear the Terrors of approaching Death, with the mo&s;t ardent Sup|plications, he begged his Si&s;ter not to leave him in that Extremity.</P>
<P>"Can you, my <HI>Epitia,</HI> &s;aid he, the Tears fa&s;t &s;treaming down his pale Cheeks as he &s;poke, can you endure to have your Brother mangled by the Hands of a ba&s;e Executioner, dragged to a painful Death at the&s;e early Years, divided from you for ever; him who lay in the &s;ame Womb with you, whom the &s;ame Father begot, bred up in Infancy together, the Partaker of all your childi&s;h Sports, and in riper Years the Companion of your Studies?

Oh, my dear Si&s;ter, comply with his Propo&s;al; and &s;ince you have a rea&s;onable Hope of having your Honour repaired by Marriage, do not, I conjure you, ca&s;t away the Life of your Bro|ther."</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable Youth, ending with a new Gu&s;h of Tears, ca&s;t his Arms round the Neck of his weeping Si&s;ter, and holding her fa&s;t folded to his &s;obbing Bo&s;om, would not part from her, till, vanqui&s;hed by his Tears and her own Affection, which pleaded too &s;trong|ly for him, &s;he promi&s;ed to con&s;ent to what <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> required, on Condition, that he mar|ried her afterwards, and gave him a free Pardon.</P>
<P>This being concluded on, &s;he left her Bro|ther, ta&s;ting, by Anticipation, the Joy of re|covered Life; and returning the next Day to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> with downca&s;t Looks and faultering Accents, &s;he told him, that the De&s;ire of de|livering her Brother, and the Hope which he had given her of making her his Wife, had induced her to con&s;ent to his De&s;ires; but &s;he required a free Pardon for her Brother; that he &s;hould not only have his Life, but an Ex|emption from any other Puni&s;hment which he had incurred by his Offence.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who now thought him&s;elf the hap|pie&s;t Man in the World, &s;ince he had gained the mo&s;t lovely and amiable Woman in it to his Will, replied, "that he confirmed the Hope he had formerly given her to marry her, and that if &s;he would pa&s;s that Night with him, her Brother &s;hould be &s;ent home to her in the Morning."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="27"><HI>Epitia,</HI> reluctantly con&s;enting, as &s;oon as the Morning dawned, impatient to &s;ee her Brother at Liberty, di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his Arms, and reminding him of his Promi&s;e to marry her, demanded the Liberty of her Brother.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> told her, &s;he had obliged him &s;o much by her kind Compliance, and his Gra|titude for it was &s;o great, that he would re|lea&s;e her Brother immediately, and &s;ent Or|ders for the Jailer to attend him, whom, in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Epitia,</HI> he commanded to &s;end the Brother of that Lady to her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Jailer departing, <HI>Epitia</HI> took Leave of the Governor, eager to embrace her beloved Brother, and congratulate him upon the Free|dom &s;he had obtained for him, and returning home, waited for his Arrival with a plea&s;ing Impatience.</P>
<P>At length the Jailer appeared, followed by two Men, who carried a Bier covered with black Cloth, which the Jailer taking off, di&s;|covered the Corp&s;e of the unhappy Youth, who had been executed that Morning.</P>
<P>No Language can expre&s;s, nor Imagination conceive, the A&s;toni&s;hment, Grief and Hor|ror which filled the whole Soul of <HI>Epitia</HI> at that cruel Sight; motionle&s;s like a Statue &s;he &s;tood at the Side of the Bier, her Eyes firmly fixed on the &s;till bleeding Trunk, and though her Heart was torn with the mo&s;t agonizing Grief, yet not a Tear or Sigh e&s;caped her.</P>
<P>After gazing thus for &s;ome Moments, &s;he rai&s;ed her Head, and turning to the Jailer with dry Eyes and compo&s;ed Voice, "Friend,
<PB N="13" REF="28">
&s;aid &s;he, tell thy Lord and mine, that &s;uch as he has been plea&s;ed to &s;end my Brother, I have received him; and that though he has not gratified my Will, yet I am contented, &s;ince he has &s;atisfied his own; thus his Will is mine, and I acquie&s;ce in the Ju&s;tice of the Deed he has performed: Tell him al&s;o that for the fu|ture I &s;hall be always ready to devote my&s;elf to his Plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>The Jailer returning to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> recounted all that <HI>Epitia</HI> had &s;aid; adding, that &s;he di&s;|covered no Sign of Di&s;content at the horrid Pre&s;ent he brought her.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> rejoiced extremely at this News, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Epitia</HI> would give him the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on without claiming the Performance of his Promi&s;e to marry her, &s;ince &s;he had not re&s;ented the Death of her Brother.</P>
<P>But that unhappy Maid, who&s;e Thoughts were wholly divided between Grief and the De&s;ire of Revenge, no &s;ooner found her&s;elf a|lone, than falling in an Exta&s;y of Sorrow on the dead Body of her beloved Brother, &s;he &s;hed a River of Tears upon it, and clo&s;ely em|bracing it in her Arms, a Thou&s;and Times &s;he cur&s;ed the Cruelty of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> and her own weak Simplicity, that e'er &s;he re&s;igned her Honour, &s;he did not oblige him to pay the Price of it by delivering her Brother.&mdash;Now &s;krieking aloud, and wildly beating her fair Bo&s;om, that heaved with unutterable Angui&s;h, &s;he contemplated the bleeding Coar&s;e again, and rouzed by that &s;ad Spectacle&mdash;"Wilt thou, then <HI>Epitia,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, wilt thou &s;uffer this

<P>Fixing then upon this Thought, and not doubting but <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> would &s;hortly &s;end to her, to pa&s;s another Night with him, &s;he re&s;olved to comply, and with a Dagger, that &s;he would take &s;ecretly along with her, murder him when he was a&s;leep; and if, without Fear of being di&s;covered, &s;he could do it, to cut off his Head, and carrying it to the Tomb of her Bro|ther, there offer it to his Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>This being re&s;olved upon, &s;he expected a Me&s;&s;age from him with much Impatience; but during that Interval, reflecting more ma|turely upon her Scheme, &s;he thought it better to tru&s;t the Revenge of her Wrongs to the known Ju&s;tice of the Emperor, than &s;uffer a &s;econd Violation, and hazard likewi&s;e the Suc|ce&s;s of her Enterprize by undertaking it her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being informed that the Emperor was at <HI>Villaco,</HI> &s;he went thither in a mourning Habit,
<PB N="15" REF="30">
and having ea&s;ily procured an Audience of him; &s;he threw her&s;elf at his Feet all in Tears. "Mo&s;t &s;acred Sir, &s;aid &s;he, the ba&s;e Ingratitude, and unequaled Cruelty the Go|vernor of <HI>In&s;pruck</HI> has u&s;ed towards me, has brought me hither to implore your Ju&s;tice"&mdash;Then bending her Eyes to the Ground, her fair Face being dyed with Blu&s;hes, &s;he told the Emperor, "that her Brother having been condemned to die; to &s;ave his Life, &s;he had con&s;ented to the loo&s;e De&s;ires of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who had made her Com|pliance the only Condition of his Pardon; but that after he had robbed her of her Honour, in&s;tead of repairing it, as he had promi&s;ed by Marriage, or freeing her Brother, which he had &s;worn to do, he &s;ent his dead Body to her the next Morning."</P>
<P><HI>Epitia</HI> could not recal this mournful Image to her Mind, without relap&s;ing into &s;o vio|lent an Agony of Grief, that the Emperor, and the Lords who were about him, were at once &s;truck with A&s;toni&s;hment, Horror and Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Maximine,</HI> though he was greatly moved, having given one Ear to <HI>Epitia,</HI> re&s;erved the other for <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> and rai&s;ing the fair Mourn|er from the Ground; he di&s;mi&s;s'd her to re|po&s;e, and &s;ent immediate Orders to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> to appear before him, charging his Me&s;&s;enger, and all who had heard <HI>Epitia</HI>'s Complaint, upon pain of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, not to give any intimation of it to <HI>Juri&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>The cruel Governor, who had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of what had happened, obeyed the
<PB N="16" REF="31">
Emperor's Commands, with great Chearful|ne&s;s, and pre&s;enting him&s;elf before him, with all the A&s;&s;urance of con&s;cious Innocence; de|&s;ired to know his &s;acred Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>You &s;hall be informed of it immediately, &s;aid the Emperor; then turning to &s;ome of his Attendants, he ordered them to bring <HI>Epitia</HI> into his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> when he beheld the unhappy Lady, whom he had &s;o cruelly injured, now &s;ubdued for the fir&s;t Time by the Stings of Con&s;ci|ence, his vital Spirits almo&s;t for&s;ook him, an a&s;hy Palene&s;s over&s;pread his Face, and an uni|ver&s;al trembling &s;eized his whole Body.</P>
<P>The Emperor, who beheld the&s;e Signs of Guilt, no longer doubted, but that all <HI>Epitia</HI> had &s;aid was true, and beholding him with a furious Look; "Li&s;ten, &s;aid he, to the Com|plaint this Lady has to make again&s;t you;" and then commanded <HI>Epitia</HI> to relate her Story.</P>
<P>She accordingly obeyed, and recounted all the Particulars of <HI>Juri&s;te</HI>'s Ba&s;ene&s;s and Ingra|titude to her, and concluding with Tears, demanded Ju&s;tice of the Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> hearing this Accu&s;ation, approached <HI>Epitia,</HI> and thinking to &s;ooth her &s;aid, "Could I ever have believed <HI>Epitia,</HI> that you whom I have &s;o much loved, would come hither to accu&s;e me to the Emperor".</P>
<P><HI>Maximine,</HI> who would not &s;uffer him to u&s;e any of his Arts to &s;often the injur'd Maid, interrupted him &s;ternly. "This is no Time for you to play the pa&s;&s;ionate Lover, &s;aid he,
<PB N="17" REF="32">
An&s;wer, to the Crimes &s;he charges you with."</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> finding that his Blandi&s;hments would be of no U&s;e to him, left <HI>Epitia,</HI> and replied, "'Tis true, my Lord, I condemned the Brother of this Lady to lo&s;e his Head, for having forcibly violated the Cha&s;tity of a Virgin; this being the Puni&s;hment the Law had provided for his Crime; and in cau&s;ing the Sentence to be executed upon him, I only obeyed your Maje&s;ty's Commands, who above all Things recommended to me, the &s;trict Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, which mu&s;t have been injured, had I &s;uffer'd him to remain alive."</P>
<P>"Since the Pre&s;ervation of Ju&s;tice, was the Motive of your Actions, replied <HI>Epitia,</HI> why did you violate it, by promi&s;ing to grant my Brother his Pardon, and by means of that Promi&s;e, which you did not perform, and the Hope you had given me of taking me for your Wife, which you have neglected to fulfil, rob me of my Honour; if my Brother for a &s;mall Crime merited all the Severity of the Law, &s;urely you de&s;erve it, who&s;e Guilt is much greater than his was."</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> having nothing to &s;ay, in excu&s;e of him&s;elf, continued &s;ilent&mdash;"And is it thus then, &s;aid the Emperor to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> that thou do&s;t admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice? but never more &s;hall it be in thy Power to act &s;uch Villanies, nor &s;halt thou e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, depend upon it."</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> now began to implore Mercy, while <HI>Epitia</HI> on the other Hand, loudly de|manded Ju&s;tice&mdash;The Emperor, who had well con&s;idered the Simplicity of <HI>Epitia,</HI> and the
<PB N="18" REF="33">
great Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> ca&s;t in his Mind, how he might repair her Honour, and yet do Ju&s;tice on the Governor, and after &s;ome Pau&s;e, he declared his Intention of oblig|ing <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> to marry her.</P>
<P>The Lady however refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to it, &s;aying, "&s;he could not think of becoming the Wife of a Man, who had murdered her Brother, and betrayed her;" but the Emperor would be obeyed, and they were immediately married.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te</HI> now thought he had no more to fear, when the Emperor, permitting <HI>Epitia</HI> to re|tire to her Lodgings, turned towards <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who &s;till remained in his Pre&s;ence, and &s;aid. "Two Crimes ha&s;t thou committed, each of which de&s;erves a mo&s;t rigorous Puni&s;hment. Fir&s;t, by a mo&s;t dete&s;table Artifice violating the Cha&s;tity of an unhappy Girl, and Second|ly, breaking the Faith, thou had&s;t given her, by putting her Brother to death. For the fir&s;t Injury I have provided &s;ome Recompence by making thee marry the deceived Lady, and for the Second, I condemn thee to lo&s;e thy Head, as thou made&s;t her Brother to lo&s;e his."</P>
<P>The Horror of <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> at this unexpected Sentence may be ea&s;ier imagined, than de|&s;cribed; it was in vain for him to &s;ue for Mercy, the Emperor was determined, and he was led away to Pri&s;on, in order to be executed the next Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> no longer hoping for Pardon, di&s;|po&s;ed him&s;elf to meet patiently the Death he had &s;o well de&s;erved; when <HI>Epitia,</HI> being in|formed of the Sentence that had been pa&s;t up|on
<PB N="19" REF="34">
him, ha&s;tened to Court, and intreating another Audience of the Emperor; as &s;oon as &s;he was admitted to his Pre&s;ence, throwing her&s;elf at his Feet, &s;he &s;aid, "Mo&s;t &s;acred Sir, the Cruelty and Inju&s;tice <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> u&s;ed towards me, moved me to come to your Maje&s;ty, and implore Ju&s;tice for the double Wrong I receiv|ed from him, which you have mo&s;t graciou&s;ly granted; my violated Cha&s;tity you have re|paired by obliging him to marry me, and for my Broth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r's Death, contrary to his &s;olemn Promi&s;e, you have condemned him to die. As a violated Maid, as an injured Si&s;ter, I then demanded Ju&s;tice on him, but as his Wife I now implore Mercy. Con&s;ider, &s;acred Sir, this new Obligation was impo&s;ed on me, by you; his Death was before due to my Wrongs, his Life is now become my Care, through the Engagements you have made me enter into with him. To repair my Honour you gave him to me for a Hu&s;band; if he dies by my Accu&s;ation, your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t generous Intentions will not avail me, &s;ince the World will brand my Name with Infamy and Cru|elty! Oh! let not the Sword of Ju&s;tice, thus mi&s;erably cut the Knot you have &s;o lately tied; grant my Hu&s;band's Life to my Prayers; let your Clemency equal your Ju&s;tice, and in the U&s;e of both be like the Immortals them&s;elves."</P>
<P><HI>Epitia</HI> ended here, and the Emperor, &s;eiz'd with A&s;toni&s;hment and Admiration at the Greatne&s;s of her Mind, thought he could do no le&s;s than grant the Demand &s;he &s;o gene|rou&s;ly made, and &s;ending immediately for
<PB N="20" REF="35">
<HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> he &s;aid, "Wickedly as thou ha&s;t acted towards this Lady, yet &s;uch is her Genero&s;ity and unequalled Goodne&s;s, that &s;he has &s;olicited no le&s;s ardently for thy Pardon than if thou had&s;t never offended her; I give thee Life then; but know thou owe&s;t that Life to her Me|diation; and if &s;he is willing, &s;ince I have made thee her Hu&s;band, to live with thee as &s;uch, I con&s;ent it &s;hould be &s;o; but take care to treat her with the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s; for if I ever hear that thou do&s;t otherwi&s;e, thou &s;halt feel the &s;evere&s;t Effects of my Di&s;|plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>The Emperor, in fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, took <HI>Epitia</HI>'s Hand and gave it to <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> who, with his Wife, falling at <HI>Maximine</HI>'s Feet, gave him Thanks for the great Good|ne&s;s he had &s;hewn them; and <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> reflect|ing on the unmerited Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;i|ty of <HI>Epitia,</HI> ever loved her with the mo&s;t ar|dent Affection, and lived happily with her to the End of his Days.</P>

<P>The Duke then &s;lipping away, re&s;umes the Habit of a Friar, and, after &s;ome Reflexions on the Government, he is ordered by the De|puty to be carried to Pri&s;on, and being &s;eized by a wild young Fellow, his Hood falls off, and he is di&s;covered to be the Duke.</P>
<P><HI>Angelo</HI> hereupon confe&s;&s;es his Crime; the Duke orders him to marry <HI>Mariana</HI> immediate|ly, which being done, he condemns him to Death. At the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mariana</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> he is pardoned; and the Duke, charmed with the Virtue and Beauty of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> offers him&s;elf to her for a Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The re&s;t is all Epi&s;ode, made up of the ex|travagant Behaviour of a wild Rake, the Blun|ders of a drunken Clown, and the Ab&s;urdi|ties of an ignorant Con&s;table.</P>
<P>There are a greater Diver&s;ity of Characters, and more Intrigues in the Fable of the Play, than the Novel of <HI>Cinthio</HI>; yet I think, where|ever <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has invented, he is greatly be|low the Noveli&s;t; &s;ince the Incidents he has added, are neither nece&s;&s;ary nor probable.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> and <HI>Epitia,</HI> of it&s;elf, afforded a very affecting Fable for a Play; it is only faulty in the Cata&s;trophe. The Reader, who cannot but be extremely enraged at the Deceit and Cruelty of <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> and very de|&s;irous of his meeting with a Puni&s;hment due to his Crime, is greatly di&s;appointed, to find him
<PB N="25" REF="40">
in the End, not only pardoned, but made hap|py in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the beautiful <HI>Epitia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> though he has altered and ad|ded a good deal, yet has not mended the Mo|ral; for he al&s;o &s;hews Vice not only pardoned, but left in Tranquility.</P>
<P>The cruel, the vicious and hypocritical <HI>An|gelo,</HI> marries a fair and virtuous Woman, who tenderly loved him, and is re&s;tored to the Fa|vour of his Prince.</P>
<P>I &s;aid before, that the Story of <HI>Juri&s;te</HI> and <HI>Epitia</HI> afforded an affecting Subject for a Play; and it is to be wi&s;hed, &s;ince <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> thought proper to found one upon it, that he had left the Fable &s;imple and entire as it was, without loading it with u&s;ele&s;s Incidents, unnece&s;&s;ary Characters, and ab&s;urd and improbable In|trigue.</P>
<P>Thus it would have &s;tood by keeping clo&s;e to the Noveli&s;t: A young Gentleman, van|qui&s;hed by the Force of a too violent Pa&s;&s;ion, ravi&s;hes a Virgin, whom he is afterwards willing to marry, but is &s;eiz'd and condemn'd to die for his Crime; his Si&s;ter a beautiful Maid, who tenderly loves the unfortunate Youth, &s;olicits the rigid Governor for his Pardon, which he refu&s;es, unle&s;s &s;he &s;acrifices her Honour to him. The Lady rejects his Pro|po&s;al with Di&s;dain, but &s;ubdued by the affect|ing Tears and Prayers of a Brother, who&s;e Life is dearer to her than her own, &s;he reluct|antly con&s;ents to the Governor's Propo&s;al, on Condition, that he &s;hould give her Borther a free Pardon, and repair her Honour hereaf|ter by Marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="41">The Governor binds him&s;elf by Oath, to perform both the&s;e Conditions; which Oath he breaks; after the unfortunate Lady had paid the Price of them, and &s;ends an immediate Order for her Brother's Execution.</P>
<P>The Lady in the violence of her Grief and Rage, re&s;olves to murder him with her own Hands, but reflecting that &s;he could not take this Revenge on him, without &s;ubjecting her&s;elf to a &s;econd Violation, &s;he complains of her Wrongs to her Sovereign, and demands Ju|&s;tice on the impious Perpetrator of them.</P>
<P>The Emperor in order to repair her Honour, obliges the perfidious Governor to marry her, and then commands him to be led to Exe|cution, which &s;he by an exalted Piece of Genero&s;ity oppo&s;es, and as his Wife kneels and &s;olicits ardently for his Pardon; which the Emperor at la&s;t grants.</P>
<P>Here the Noveli&s;t &s;hould be dropt, and the Cata&s;trophe, according to poetical Ju&s;tice, might be thus wound up.</P>
<P>The Lady having performed her Duty, in &s;aving the Life of a Man, who, however un|worthy, was &s;till her Hu&s;band, &s;hould de|vote her&s;elf to a Cloi&s;ter, for the remainder of her Life; and the wretched <HI>Juri&s;te,</HI> de|prived of his Dignity, in Di&s;grace with his Prince, and the Object of Univer&s;al Contempt and Hatred, to compleat his Mi&s;eries, he &s;hould feel all his former Violence of Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Epitia</HI> renewed, and falling into an Exce&s;s of Grief, for her Lo&s;s, (&s;ince the Practice is allowed by Chri&s;tian Authors) &s;tab him&s;elf in De pair.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="42">The Fable thus manag'd, takes in as great a Variety of Incidents, as with Propriety can be introduced in a Play, and tho&s;e Incidents naturally ri&s;ing out of one another, and all de|pendant on the principal Subject of the Dra|ma, forms that Unity of Action, which the Laws of Critici&s;m require.</P>
<P>This Fable al&s;o, would not be de&s;titute of a Moral, which as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has managed it, is wholly wanting. The fatal Con&s;equence of an irregular Pa&s;&s;ion in <HI>Claudio</HI>; the Danger of endeavouring to procure Good by indirect Means in <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and the Puni&s;hment of lawle&s;s Tyranny in the Governor, convey In&s;truction equally u&s;eful and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Since the Fable in <HI>Cinthio</HI> is &s;o much bet|ter contrived than that of <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea|&s;ure,</HI> on which it is founded, the Poet &s;ure cannot be defended, for having altered it &s;o much for the wor&s;e; and it would be but a poor Excu&s;e, for his want of Judgment, to &s;ay, that had he followed the Noveli&s;t clo&s;er, his Play would have been a Tragedy, and to make a Comedy, he was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of winding up the Cata&s;trophe as he has done.</P>
<P>The comic Part of <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> is all Epi&s;ode, and has no Dependance on the principal Subject, which even as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has managed it, has none of the Requi&s;ites of Comedy, great and flagrant Crimes, &s;uch as tho&s;e of <HI>Angelo,</HI> in <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure,</HI> are properly the Subject of Tragedy, the De&s;ign of which is to &s;hew the fatal Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Crimes, and the Puni&s;hment that never fails to attend them. The light Fol|lies
<PB N="28" REF="43">
of a <HI>Lucio,</HI> may be expo&s;ed, ridiculed and corrected in Comedy.</P>
<P>That <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> made a wrong Choice of his Subject, &s;ince he was re&s;olved to torture it into a Comedy, appears by the low Con|trivance, ab&s;urd Intrigue, and improbable In|cidents, he was obliged to introduce, in order to bring about three or four Weddings, in|&s;tead of one good Beheading, which was the Con&s;equence naturally expected.</P>
<P>The Duke, who it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, has an excellent plotting Brain, gives it out that he is going <HI>incog.</HI> to <HI>Poland,</HI> upon weighty Affairs of State, and &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>Angelo</HI> to govern till his Return; to Friar <HI>Thomas</HI> his Confidant, however, he imparts his true De&s;ign, which is, in his Ab&s;ence, to have &s;ome &s;evere Laws revived, that had been long di&s;u&s;ed: Methinks this Conduct is very unworthy of a good Prince; if he thought it fit and nece&s;&s;ary to revive tho&s;e Laws, why does he commit that to another, which it was his Duty to perform?</P>
<P>The Friar's An&s;wer is very pertinent.</P>
<Q><L>It re&s;ted in your Grace</L>
<L>T' unloo&s;e this tied-up Ju&s;tice when you pleas'd;</L>
<L>And it in you more dreadful would have &s;eem'd</L>
<L>Than in Lord <HI>Angelo.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Duke replies,
<Q>I do fear, too dreadful.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="44">In &s;hort, the poor Duke is afraid to exert his own Authority, by enforcing tho&s;e Laws, notwith&s;tanding he thinks them ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and therefore as he &s;ays,
<Q><L>I have on <HI>Angelo</HI> impo&s;ed the Office;</L>
<L>Who may in the Ambu&s;h of my Name &s;trike home.</L></Q></P>
<P>However, in Fact, it is the Duke who &s;trikes in the Ambu&s;h of <HI>Angelo</HI>'s Name; for it is he who cau&s;es <HI>Angelo</HI> to put tho&s;e &s;evere Laws in Execution, while he &s;kulks in Con|cealment to ob&s;erve how they are received; if ill, <HI>Angelo</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand the Con&s;equence; if well he will enjoy the Merit of it. And in order to di&s;cover how Things are carried on in the Commonwealth, he makes the Friar procure him a Habit of the Order, and thus di&s;gui&s;ed, where does he go? Why, to the common Jail, among the condemned Male|factors. His Speculations are wholly confined to this Scene.</P>
<P>Here, entirely taken up with the Affairs of the Pri&s;oners, his Highne&s;s ambles backwards and forwards, from the Pri&s;on to <HI>Maria|na</HI>'s Hou&s;e, fetching and carrying Me&s;&s;ages, contriving how to elude tho&s;e very Laws he had been &s;o de&s;irous of having executed; cor|rupting one of the principal of his Magi&s;trates, and teaching him how to deceive his Delegate in Power.</P>
<P>How comes it to pa&s;s, that the Duke is &s;o well acquainted with the Story of <HI>Mariana,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="45">
to whom <HI>Angelo</HI> was betrothed, but abandoned by him on Account of the Lo&s;s of her For|tune? She &s;peaks of the Duke as of a Per&s;on &s;he had been long acquainted with.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mariana.</SPEAKER>
<L>Here comes a Man of Comfort, who&s;e Advice</L>
<L>Hath often &s;till'd my brawling Di&s;content.</L>
</SP>
<P>Yet this could only happen while he a&s;&s;umed the Character of a Friar, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s but for two or three Days at mo&s;t; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d not po&s;|&s;ibly have been acquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Story be|fore; if he had, the Character of <HI>Angelo</HI> would have been al&s;o known to him; and con&s;e|quently it was unnece&s;&s;ary to make him his Deputy, in order to try him further, which was one of his Rea&s;ons, as he tells Friar <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> for concealing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If it is granted, that the Duke could not know <HI>Mariana</HI>'s Affair before his Di&s;gui&s;e; what Opportunities had he of learning it afterwards? For, notwith&s;tanding what <HI>Mariana</HI> &s;ays, which intimates a long Acquaintance, it is certain it could have been but a very &s;hort one; &s;ome extraordinary Accident therefore mu&s;t have brought her Story to his Knowledge, which we find was known to no one el&s;e; for <HI>Angelo</HI>'s Reputation for Sanctity was very high, and that could not have been, if his Wrongs to <HI>Mariana</HI> were publickly known.</P>
<P>But why does not the Poet acquaint us with this extraordinary Accident, which happens &s;o conveniently for his Purpo&s;e? If he is account|able
<PB N="31" REF="46">
to our Eyes for what he makes us &s;ee, is he not al&s;o accountable to our Judgment for what he would have us believe? But, in &s;hort, without all this Jumble of Incon&s;i&s;tencies, the Comedy would have been a downright Tra|gedy; for <HI>Claudio</HI>'s Head mu&s;t have been cut off, if <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had not con&s;ented to redeem him; and the Duke would have wanted a Wi&s;e, if &s;uch a convenient Per&s;on as <HI>Mariana</HI> had not been introduced to &s;upply her Place, and &s;ave her Honour.</P>
<P>As the Character of the Duke is ab&s;urd and ridiculous&punc; that of <HI>Angelo</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent to the la&s;t Degree; his Ba&s;ene&s;s to <HI>Mariana,</HI> his wicked Attempts on the Cha&s;tity of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> his villainous Breach of Promi&s;e, and Cruelty to <HI>Claudio,</HI> prove him to be a very bad Man, long practi&s;ed in Wickedne&s;s; yet when he finds him&s;elf &s;truck with the Beauty of <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> he &s;tarts at the Temptation; rea&s;ons on his Frailty; a&s;ks A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Heaven to overcome it; re&s;olves again&s;t it, and &s;eems car|ried away by the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, to commit what his better Judgment abhors.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e the Manners of a &s;anctified Hy|pocrite, &s;uch as <HI>Angelo</HI> is repre&s;ented to be? Are they not rather tho&s;e of a good Man, overcome by a powerful Temptation? That <HI>Angelo</HI> was not a good Man, appears by his ba&s;e Treatment of <HI>Mariana</HI>; for certainly no|thing can be viler than to break his Contract with a Woman of Merit, becau&s;e &s;he had ac|cidentally become poor; and, to excu&s;e his own Conduct, load the unfortunate Innocent with ba&s;e A&s;per&s;ions, and add Infamy to her
<PB N="32" REF="47">
other Mi&s;eries: Yet this is the Man, who, when attacked by a Temptation, kneels, prays, expo&s;tulates with him&s;elf, and, while he &s;carce yields in Thought to do wrong, his Mind feels all the Remor&s;e which attends ac|tual Guilt.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that <HI>Angelo</HI> is a very extraordinary Hypocrite, and thinks in a Manner quite contrary from all others of his Order; for they, as it is natural, are more concerned for the Con&s;equences of their Crimes, than the Crimes them&s;elves, whereas he is only troubled about the Crime, and wholly regardle&s;s of the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> in the Play &s;eems to be an Improvement upon that of <HI>Epitia</HI> in the Novel; for <HI>I&s;abella</HI> ab&s;olutely refu&s;es, and per&s;i&s;ts in her Refu&s;al, to give up her Honour to &s;ave her Brother's Life; whereas <HI>Epitia,</HI> overcome by her own Tenderne&s;s of Nature, and the affecting Prayers of the unhappy Youth, yields to what her Soul abhors, to redeem him from a &s;hameful Death.

<P>Is this the Language of a mode&s;t tender Maid; one who had devoted her&s;elf to a re|ligious Life, and was remarkable for an exalt|ed Under&s;tanding, and unaffected Piety in the earlie&s;t Bloom of Life?</P>
<P>From her Character, her Profe&s;&s;ion, and Degree of Relation to the unhappy Youth, one might have expected mild Expo&s;tulations, wi&s;e Rea&s;onings, and gentle Rebukes; his De|&s;ire of Life, though purcha&s;ed by Methods he could not approve, was a natural Frailty, which a Si&s;ter might have pitied and excu&s;ed, and have made u&s;e of her &s;uperior Under&s;tand|ing to rea&s;on down his Fears, recal nobler Ideas to his Mind, teach him what was due to her Honour and his own, and reconcile him to his approaching Death, by Arguments drawn from that Religion and Virtue of which &s;he made &s;o high a Profe&s;&s;ion; but that Tor|rent
<PB N="34" REF="49">
of abu&s;ive Language, tho&s;e coar&s;e and un|womanly Reflexions on the Virtue of her Mother, her exulting Cruelty to the dying Youth, are the Manners of an affected Prude, outragious in her &s;eeming Virtue; not of a pious, innocent and tender Maid.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee the U&s;e of all that jug|gling and Ambiguity at the winding up of the Cata&s;trophe; <HI>I&s;abella</HI> comes and demands Ju&s;tice of the Duke for the Wrongs &s;he had received from his Deputy, declaring &s;he had &s;acrificed her Innocence to &s;ave her Brother's Life, whom <HI>Angelo</HI> had, notwith&s;tanding his Promi&s;e to the contrary, cau&s;ed to be exe|cuted.</P>
<P>Upon the Duke's telling her, that he be|lieved her Accu&s;ation to be fal&s;e, &s;he goes away in Di&s;content, without &s;aying a Word more: Is this natural?

<P>The Reader can ea&s;ily di&s;cover how the Plot will be unravelled at la&s;t; but the unne|ce&s;&s;ary Intricacies in unravelling it, &s;till remain to be accounted for.</P>
<P>The Play &s;ets out with the Moral in the Title, <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI>; but how is this made out? the Duke &s;peaking of <HI>Angelo</HI> to <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;ays,

<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;aid he, one Day to him, I love you as my Brother; and it gives me great Pain to &s;ee you thus con&s;ume away like Snow melting in the Sun; don't you &s;ee you wa&s;te your Time and &s;pend your Fortune, without obtaining either Honour or Advantage: Your
<PB N="40" REF="55">
Endeavours to win this Woman are all ineffec|tual; the more you &s;ollicit her, the more rigid &s;he becomes; certainly it is a great Folly to at|tempt a Thing which is not only difficult to do, but impo&s;&s;ible; you may be convinced &s;he nei|ther cares for you, or any Thing you can do to plea&s;e her; perhaps &s;he has &s;ome other Lover, who is &s;o dear to her, &s;he would not quit him for an Emperor: You are young, my dear <HI>Ro|meo,</HI> your Per&s;on is more lovely than any Youth's in this City; you are, (let me &s;peak it, &s;ince it is Truth, to your Face,) you are generous, virtuous and elegant; to the&s;e amiable Qualities are ad|ded the more &s;olid Advantages of Learning and Wit: You are the only Son of one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t of our Noblemen; does he re&s;train you in your Expences; does he con|troul you in your Plea&s;ures? Is he not your Factor only to take Care of your Affairs, while you &s;pend your Time as you plea&s;e? Awake, I conjure you, and begin to reflect at length upon the Error you have been guilty of; remove from your Eyes the Veil which blinds you, and hinders you from &s;eeing the Path you are pur&s;uing; re&s;olve to place your Affection on &s;ome Per&s;on more de&s;erving, and chu&s;e a Lady who will better reward your Love; a ju&s;t Indignation is often more powerful in the Heart than Love it&s;elf: Now when A&s;&s;emblies and Ma&s;querades are held all over this great City, mix with the Company every where, and when you meet the ungrateful Woman you have &s;olicited &s;o long, gaze not on her Face, but reflect on her Inju&s;tice, her Cruelty and her Pride; do not doubt but the many In|juries
<PB N="41" REF="56">
you have &s;uffered will excite an Indig|nation &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that your Pa&s;|&s;ion will in Time yield to its Force, and you, by Degrees, regain your Liberty.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the faithful Friend of <HI>Romeo</HI> added many others, to engage him to quit his un&s;ucce&s;sful Pur&s;uit: <HI>Romeo</HI> li&s;tened to him with Attention, and took a Re&s;olution immediately to put his wi&s;e Councils in Prac|tice.</P>
<P>The Fea&s;t being now begun, he had fre|quent Opportunities of meeting the &s;cornful Maid; but he always carefully avoided look|ing at her, gazing on the other Ladies, and anxiou&s;ly examining the Beauties of every one, to chu&s;e her who was mo&s;t agreeable to him.</P>
<P>About this Time, <HI>Antonio Capellet,</HI> the Head of that Family, made a magnificent, Fea&s;t, to which he invited a great many of the chief Nobility and Ladies, mo&s;t of the Youth of Quality being there; <HI>Romeo,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the long continued Hatred between their Fa|milies, came thither al&s;o at Night, being ma&s;qued like the re&s;t of the Company; but &s;oon after throwing it off, as all the others did, he &s;eated him&s;elf at one Corner of the Hall, which, by the great Number of Torches, being made as light as Day, he could conve|niently behold the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> &s;oon drew the Eyes of the Company upon him, and of the Ladies particularly, who, &s;truck with his Boldne&s;s in coming to that Hou&s;e, could not conceal their Admiration of it; his Enemies, however, on Account of his Youth, his extraordinary Beauty, the Sweet|ne&s;s
<PB N="42" REF="57">
of his Manners, and the almo&s;t univer&s;al Love he had acquired, forbore to give him any Di&s;turbance, which, perhaps, had he been elder, and le&s;s amiable, they might have done.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> therefore, having lei&s;ure to con&s;ider the Beauty of the Ladies that were at the Fea&s;t, began to prai&s;e them more or le&s;s, ac|cording to his Ta&s;te, and, without dancing him&s;elf, took a Plea&s;ure in looking upon tho&s;e that did: While he was thus employed, he &s;aw a young Lady of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Beauty, who&s;e Name was unknown to him; his Heart immediately confe&s;&s;ed this Object to be more charming than any he had ever &s;een; he gazed on her attentively, and the longer he gazed, the more Beauty and Graces he di&s;covered in her. Finding an unu&s;ual Plea&s;ure in contem|plating her, he was not able for a Moment to remove his Eyes from her Face, but darting a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ionate Looks at the young Beau|ty, he &s;ecretly re&s;olved to exert his utmo&s;t En|deavours to gain her Affections.</P>
<P>Thus was his former Pa&s;&s;ion vanqui&s;hed by this new one, and gave Place to a Flame that was never extingui&s;hed but by his Death: Not daring in that &s;u&s;pected Hou&s;e to enquire the Name of the young Beauty that had charmed him, he contented him&s;elf with feeding his Eyes with her Sight, and finding new Graces in every Look and Action drank in large Draughts of the &s;weet Poi&s;on of Love.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> being, as was &s;aid before, &s;eated in a Corner of the Hall, had a full View of all the Company, who, in returning to their
<PB N="43" REF="58">
Places after Dancing, pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by him; <HI>Julietta,</HI> &s;o was the young Lady called, who had charmed him, not having ob&s;erved him before, was &s;truck with Admiration of his Per&s;on, as &s;he went by the Place where he &s;at: This fair One was Daughter to <HI>Capellet,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, who had given the Fea&s;t, and ignorant of the Name and Quality of <HI>Romeo</HI>; yet he appearing to her the mo&s;t beautiful Youth &s;he had ever &s;een, &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t the Plea&s;ure &s;he took in gazing on him; but &s;ecretly &s;natching &s;tolen Glances at him every Moment, an unu&s;ual Softne&s;s took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Heart, and filled it with all the &s;weet Inquietudes and tender Perplexities of a begining Pa&s;&s;ion: Not &s;atisfied with gaz|ing on him at a Di&s;tance, &s;he ardently wi&s;hed he would mix among the Dancers, that &s;he might have an Opportunity of hearing him &s;peak, not doubting but her Ears would take in as much Plea&s;ure from the Agreeablene&s;s of his Di&s;cour&s;e, as her Eyes did Sweetne&s;s from his Sight, but <HI>Romeo</HI> wholly lo&s;t in the Plea|&s;ure he took in looking upon her, &s;hewed no Inclination to join the Company; and <HI>Julietta</HI> was equally incapable of any Delight, but looking at him.</P>
<P>Their Eyes being thus frequently directed to each other, their pa&s;&s;ionate Glances often met; the Sighs which accompanied tho&s;e Glances, betrayed the Emotions of their Hearts, and both were &s;en&s;ible that an Op|portunity of di&s;covering their mutual Flame was equally de&s;ired by each.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59">While they were thus taken up in exchang|ing tender and pa&s;&s;ionate Looks, the Ball broke up, and the Company mixing promi&s;|cuou&s;ly together, began the concluding Dance, called <HI>the Dance of the Torch,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>the Dance of the Hat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> in the mid&s;t of the agreeable Con|fu&s;ion of this Dance, was &s;natched up by a Lady, who forcing him into the Croud, he performed his Part, and giving the Torch, as was the Cu&s;tom, to another Lady, he drew near to <HI>Julietta,</HI> and took her by the Hand, to the inconceivable Tran&s;port of them both.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> then &s;eating her&s;elf between <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Mercutio</HI>; the latter, who was a Courtier, gay, witty, and agreeably &s;atirical, was as re|markable for the extraordinary Coldne&s;s of his Hand, as for the uncommon Sprightline&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition; and he holding one of <HI>Juli|etta</HI>'s Hands, as <HI>Romeo</HI> did the other; &s;he, who ardently de&s;ired to hear him &s;peak, turn|ing towards him with an inchanting Smile, &s;aid &s;oftly and in a trembling Voice, gently pre&s;&s;ing his Hand at the &s;ame Moment&mdash; "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Time, Sir, that you &s;eated your&s;elf near me."</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> who well knew how to make u&s;e of Advantages, &s;training her Hand pa&s;&s;ionately in return, with Eyes which &s;eemed to implore her Pity; and an Accent as if his Life hung &s;u&s;pended on her An&s;wer, a&s;ked her the Meaning of &s;uch a Benediction.</P>
<P>"Gentle Youth, replied <HI>Julietta</HI> with a Smile, I ble&s;s the Time of your coming hi|ther, becau&s;e Signior <HI>Mercutio,</HI> who&s;e Hand
<PB N="45" REF="60">
is as cold as Ice, froze me all over by his Touch, and you, for which I am much obliged to you, by the kindly Warmth of yours, have re&s;tored me again."</P>
<P>"Madam, replied <HI>Romeo</HI> immediately, I &s;hould think my&s;elf &s;uperlatively happy in be|ing able to do you any Service, and ble&s;t be|yond Mea&s;ure if you will deign to command me as the meane&s;t of your Servants; permit me however to tell you, that if my Hand has warmed you, the Fire of your bright Eyes has kindled &s;uch Flames in me, that unle&s;s you afford me &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall &s;oon be con|&s;umed to A&s;hes."</P>
<P>Scarce had he fini&s;hed the&s;e la&s;t Words, when the Dance being ended, the Company began to di&s;per&s;e; and <HI>Julietta</HI> tran&s;ported with the Exce&s;s of her new Pa&s;&s;ion; breathing an ardent Sigh and tenderly &s;training his Hand, replied in ha&s;te as &s;he parted from him, "Ala&s;s! what can I &s;ay, but that I am more yours than my own!"</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> in Hopes of knowing who &s;he was, continued &s;till in the Hall; but he had not waited long, 'till he was informed by a Friend, that &s;he was the Daughter of the Lord <HI>Capellet,</HI> who had given the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>This News threw him into great Affliction, fore&s;eeing the Difficulty and Danger there would be in pur&s;uing his Pa&s;&s;ion; but the Wound was already given, and his whole Soul was now infected with the &s;weet Venom of Love.</P>
<P>On the other Side, <HI>Julietta</HI> equally de&s;irous of knowing the Name of him who had con|quered
<PB N="46" REF="61">
her Heart; calling an old Woman, who had nur&s;ed her, to a Window, which looked into a Street, through which the Com|pany was pa&s;&s;ing, by the Light of a great Number of Torches, &s;he began to enquire the Names of &s;everal of the Ma&s;quers as they went along; and at la&s;t directing her Eyes to <HI>Romeo,</HI> a&s;ked her who that fine Youth was who carried his Ma&s;que in his Hand. The good Woman who knew him very well, told her it was <HI>Romeo,</HI> Son of the Lord <HI>Montec|chio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> &s;truck with the Sound of that Name, as with a Thunderbolt, began now to de&s;pair of ever gaining the Object of her Af|fections for a Hu&s;band: Concealing however her Confu&s;ion from the Ob&s;ervation of her Nur&s;e, &s;he retired to Bed; but her Mind was agitated with &s;o many different Thoughts, that &s;he could take no Repo&s;e: Love and De&s;pair bred a cruel Conflict in her Soul, yet Love had taken &s;o full and ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, that her De&s;ire increa&s;ed with the Impo&s;&s;ibility of gratifying it. "Ah! cried &s;he to her&s;elf, how have I &s;uffered my Affections to be thus tran&s;ported! how do I know (credulous Fool as I am) whether <HI>Romeo</HI> really loves me? Perhaps the artful Youth means only to delude me, with a di&s;&s;embled Pa&s;&s;ion, that by rob|bing me of my Honour, he may revenge him|&s;elf of my Family, and encrea&s;e the rooted Hatred between our Fathers; but can it be, that a Soul &s;o generous as his, &s;hould form a De&s;ign to ruin one who loves and adores him? Ah! if the Face be the Index of the Mind,
<PB N="47" REF="62">
his is all Loveline&s;s and Beauty, Cruelty and Deceit can never harbour in &s;o &s;weet a Dwel|ling; from a Form &s;o inchanting nothing can be expected but Truth, Gentlene&s;s and Love: But &s;uppo&s;e, added &s;he, that he loves me ho|nourably, have I not Rea&s;on to believe that my Father will never con&s;ent to our Union; and yet, who knows but our mutual Pa&s;&s;ion may be the Means of procuring a firm and perpetual Peace between our Families; I have often heard that not only the Peace of private Families has been procured by Marriages, but that warring Nations have been made Friends by that Means; ought I not then to hope that our two Hou&s;es may be reconciled by &s;uch an Event." Re&s;ting then upon this &s;oothing Thought, whenever <HI>Romeo</HI> went through the Street where &s;he lived, &s;he al|ways &s;hewed her&s;elf at a Balcony, giving him &s;uch bewitching Smiles as he pa&s;&s;ed, as filled his whole Soul (which like hers, had been to&s;t between Hope and Fear) with in|expre&s;&s;ible Delight.</P>
<P>It was not without great Danger to his his Per&s;on, that he thus haunted the Street, where &s;he dwelt, both Night and Day; but <HI>Julietta</HI>'s Smiles inflaming his De&s;ires, he could not re&s;i&s;t the &s;weet Violence that drew him continually thither; the Chamber of this fair Maid had a Window in it, which looked into a narrow Lane. <HI>Romeo</HI> when he had pa&s;&s;ed the great Street, and arrived to the Head of this Lane, often beheld her at this Window, to which &s;he would come very obligingly when &s;he &s;aw him; and by her
<PB N="48" REF="63">
Looks expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure &s;he took in &s;eeing him. One Night when <HI>Romeo</HI> came, as he was wont, to this Place, <HI>Julietta</HI> &s;eeing him, open|ed the Window; the Moon &s;hone &s;o bright, that though he retired, upon her looking out into an old ruinous Building which fronted the Window, yet &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed him plainly, and no Per&s;on being with her in the Chamber, &s;he ventured to call out to him. <HI>"Romeo,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, what do you do here alone, at &s;uch an Hour? &s;hould you be di&s;covered, I trem|ble for your Life; are you ignorant of the cruel Enmity there is between our Families, and how many Lives have been lo&s;t by it on both Sides? certainly if you are taken, you will be barbarou&s;ly murdered; why will you thus endanger your own Life and my Ho|nour?"</P>
<P>"The ardent Pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired me with, an&s;wered he, is the Cau&s;e of my com|ing hither; I know if I am di&s;covered by your Relations, they will endeavour to kill me, but I &s;hall defend my&s;elf as well as I am able, and though I may be overpowered by &s;uperior Force, yet I will not dye alone; to dye near you will take off the Bitterne&s;s of Death; yet be a&s;&s;ured, Madam, I never will be the Occa|&s;ion of bringing any Stain upon your Honour; but will with Plea&s;ure &s;acrifice my Life, to pre&s;erve it inviolate."</P>
<P>"But what is it you re-quire of me, inter|rupted <HI>Julietta?"</HI></P>
<P>"That you would permit me to enter your Chamber, Madam, replied <HI>Romeo,</HI> that I may with le&s;s Danger make known to you the
<PB N="49" REF="64">
Greatne&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion, and the cruel Tor|ments I &s;uffer for your Sake."</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> a little offended at this Demand, replied in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, <HI>"Romeo,</HI> you know the Extent of your own Pa&s;&s;ion, and I know that of mine; I know that I love you, as much as it is po&s;&s;ible for a Per&s;on to love, and perhaps more than is con&s;i&s;tent with my Ho|nour; however, I mu&s;t tell you, that if you hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s me by any other Means than Matrimony, you are much deceived; and be|cau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible you expo&s;e your&s;elf to great Danger by coming hither &s;o frequently, I am willing to bring this Affair to a &s;peedy Con|clu&s;ion; therefore, if you de&s;ire to be mine, as I wi&s;h to be eternally yours, you will make me your Wife, and for that Purpo&s;e I will be ready to meet you at any convenient Place, whatever Time you &s;hall appoint me; but, if you have any di&s;honourable Intentions towards me, go away I conjure you, and &s;uffer me to live in Peace."</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> who only wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s her with Honour, heard this Propo&s;ition with Tran&s;|port, and told her, "that he would marry her at any Time, and in any Manner &s;he plea&s;ed."</P>
<P>"'Tis well, replied <HI>Julietta,</HI> let our Nup|tials then be celebrated, by the Reverend Friar <HI>Lorenzo</HI> of <HI>Reggio,</HI> who is my &s;piri|tual Father." To this <HI>Romeo</HI> readily agreed, the good Friar being very intimate in his Fa|mily; and it was re&s;olved between them, that Romeo &s;hould &s;peak to him the next Day upon that Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65">Friar <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> in whom the Lovers cho&s;e to confide upon this. Occa&s;ion, was of the Order of the Minors, a learned Theologician and Philo&s;opher; had great Knowledge of Herbs, and was well &s;killed in the Magic Art; and that he might maintain him&s;elf in the good Opinion of the Vulgar, and quietly enjoy tho&s;e Plea|&s;ures, for which he had a Ta&s;te, he endea|voured to procure the Friend&s;hip of all Per|&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed Rank and Reputation: In this he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he had many Friends among the Nobility of <HI>Verona,</HI> parti|cularly the Father of <HI>Romeo,</HI> a Nobleman in great Credit and E&s;teem, who had a high Opinion of his Sanctity and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> al&s;o held him in great E&s;teem, and the Friar, who knew him to be a prudent and generous Youth, had a tender Affection For him. The Reverend Father, who confe&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all the Per&s;ons of Quality of both Sexes in the City, was al&s;o very intimate in the Family of the <HI>Capelletti,</HI> and was therefore intru&s;ted with the &s;piritual Direction of <HI>Ju|lietta.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> the next Day after his Conference with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, went to the Church of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and related to Friar <HI>Lorenzo</HI> the whole Story of his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julietta,</HI> and the happy Conclu&s;ion to which he had brought it, entreating at the &s;ame time his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to unite them for ever.</P>
<P>The Friar hearing this Account, promi&s;ed to do all he required, as well becau&s;e he was not able to deny <HI>Romeo</HI> any thing, as he hoped this Marriage would reconcile the two
<PB N="51" REF="66">
Hou&s;es of the <HI>Montecchi</HI> and <HI>Capelletti,</HI> and by that Means acquire to him&s;elf the Favour of Signor <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;hed to compo&s;e the Di&s;orders their Enmity cre|ated in his City.</P>
<P>The two Lovers, now only waiting for &s;ome Occa&s;ion of going to Confe&s;&s;ion, in order to effect their De&s;ign, <HI>Julietta,</HI> for the greater Conveniency, re&s;olved to tru&s;t her Nur&s;e, who &s;lept with her, with her Love for <HI>Romeo</HI>; his extreme Affection for her, and their in|tended Marriage.</P>
<P>The good Woman greatly concerned at &s;uch a precipitate De&s;ign, endeavoured to di&s;|&s;wade her from it, but to no Purpo&s;e; and moved with the affecting Arguments of <HI>Ju|lietta,</HI> was at la&s;t prevailed upon to carry a Letter to <HI>Romeo.</HI></P>
<P>The Lover was tran&s;ported with Joy at the Contents; which directed him to come, at five o'Clock that Night, to the Window in the Lane; bringing with him a Ladder of Ropes, by which he might a&s;cend to the Top.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> committing the Care of providing the Ladder to a faithful Servant of his, named <HI>Pietro,</HI> they both, at the appointed Hour, went to the Place where <HI>Julietta</HI> expected them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw <HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;he let down a Cord from the Window, which they fa&s;ten-to one End of the Ladder, &s;he drew it up, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of her Nur&s;e fixed it &s;e|curely at the Top, while <HI>Romeo</HI> and his Ser|vant took Care to fa&s;ten it well below.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="67"><HI>Romeo</HI> then boldly a&s;cending the Ladder, <HI>Pietro</HI> retired into the old ruinous Hou&s;e, till his Ma&s;ter had Occa&s;ion for him: The iron Bars before the Window were &s;et &s;o clo&s;e, that it was with Difficulty the pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Romeo</HI> could pa&s;s his Hand through to cla&s;p that of his adored <HI>Julietta.</HI>&mdash;"Oh! <HI>Romeo,</HI> cried the tran&s;|ported Maid, dearer to me than the Light of my Eyes, I de&s;ired to &s;ee you here, that I might inform you I have ordered Matters &s;o as that I can go to Confe&s;&s;ion with my Mo|ther on <HI>Friday</HI> next; we &s;hall come to the Church about the Time that the Sermon be|gins; take Care to acquaint Father <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> that he may have every Thing in readine&s;s."</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> a&s;&s;uring her that the Friar was di&s;|po&s;ed to do whatever they de&s;ired, they began to enter into a tender Conver&s;ation, which the Nece&s;&s;ity of parting for Fear of a Di&s;covery interrupting the Lover de&s;cending the Ladder, took Leave of his dear <HI>Julietta,</HI> who, though exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed with the pa&s;t Interview, thought every Moment an Age till &s;he could call <HI>Romeo</HI> her own; and <HI>Romeo,</HI> who was al|mo&s;t tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf, &s;pent the Time in di&s;cour&s;ing with his Confidant on his approaching Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The de&s;tined Day being arrived, Lady <HI>Gio|vanni,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Julietta,</HI> taking with her her Daughter and &s;ome of her Women, went to the Church of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> which was then in the Citadel; the old Lady, as &s;oon as &s;he entered, calling for Friar <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> told him, &s;he had come early with <HI>Julietta</HI> to Confe&s;&s;ion, be|cau&s;e &s;he knew he would be much hurried that

<P>The Friar, who had been in&s;tructed before by <HI>Romeo,</HI> and had him then concealed in his Confe&s;&s;ionary, giving the Ladies the Benedic|tion, went into the Convent, and entering the Confe&s;&s;ionary where <HI>Romeo</HI> was, made <HI>Juli|etta,</HI> who fir&s;t pre&s;ented her&s;elf, go into the other Cell, which was &s;lightly partitioned off from that which he and <HI>Romeo</HI> were in, hav|ing al&s;o a Grate between; as &s;oon as &s;he was entered, he gave the Sign that <HI>Romeo</HI> was within, and removing the Grate, after the fir&s;t Salutation, &s;aid to her,&mdash;"Daughter, <HI>Romeo</HI> has, informed me, that you are willing to take him for a Hu&s;band, and he al&s;o is de|&s;irous of having you for a Wife, do you both continue to be thus di&s;po&s;ed?"</P>
<P>The Lovers making An&s;wer, that the wi&s;hed for nothing el&s;e; the Friar, after a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e in Prai&s;e of holy Matrimony, pronounced the accu&s;tomed Form of Words ordained by the Church, and gave them the nuptial Benediction.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> then pre&s;enting his beloved <HI>Julietta</HI> with a Ring, which &s;he received with un&s;peak|able Plea&s;ure, he con&s;ulted with her on the Means he &s;hould u&s;e to gain Acce&s;s to her at Night, and tenderly &s;aluting her, went cau|tiou&s;ly out of the Church.</P>
<P>The Friar, replacing the Grate, heard the Confe&s;&s;ion of the happy <HI>Julietta,</HI> and di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing her, heard al&s;o tho&s;e of her Mother, and the Women who attended them, and they returned again to their Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69">Night being come, <HI>Romeo,</HI> with his Servant, went to the Garden belonging to the Lord <HI>Capellet</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and a&s;cending the Wall by the Help of his faithful <HI>Pietro,</HI> he got ea&s;ily over to the other Side, where he found his Bride; who, together with her Nur&s;e, was expecting him.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;aw her, ran to her with open Arms, and <HI>Julietta</HI> eagerly flying to him, threw her&s;elf on his Neck, and embraced him with inexpre&s;&s;ible Tran&s;port; they pa&s;&s;ed the whole Night in the Garden without Fear of being di&s;covered; and when the Morning approached, <HI>Romeo,</HI> after con&s;ulting with his fair Spou&s;e on the Methods they &s;hould u&s;e to reconcile their Parents, took Leave of her with a tender Embrace, and returned to his Hou&s;e, looking upon him&s;elf to be the happie&s;t of all Men in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o beautiful a Creature; and <HI>Julietta,</HI> who thought the whole World could not produce &s;o lovely and accompli&s;hed a Youth as her <HI>Romeo,</HI> had no other Allay to her Happine&s;s but the ardent De&s;ire &s;he felt to have their two Families re|conciled, that her Marriage might no lon|ger be concealed.</P>
<P>While the new married Couple were obliged to content them&s;elves with &s;hort and &s;tolen In|terviews, Friar <HI>Lorenzo</HI> was &s;ecretly practi&s;ing Means to reconcile their two Hou&s;es, and had put Matters in &s;uch a Train, that he had &s;ome Hopes of accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>When the Fea&s;t of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> was celebrated, it happened that great Numbers of Coaches were a&s;&s;embled at the Gate of the <HI>Bor&s;ori,</HI> near
<PB N="55" REF="70">
the Ca&s;tle <HI>Vecchio,</HI> or <HI>Old Ca&s;tle,</HI> and many of the <HI>Capelletti</HI> and <HI>Montecchi</HI> meeting in that Place, a&s;&s;aulted each other furiou&s;ly with their Arms: Among the <HI>Capelletti</HI> was a noble Youth, named <HI>Tibbald,</HI> a fir&s;t Cou&s;in of <HI>Julietta</HI>'s who being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great per&s;onal Courage, animated his People again&s;t the <HI>Montecchi,</HI> and urging them to have no Con&s;ideration for any Per&s;on whatever among their Enemies, the Fray grew very bloody, both Parties being continually encrea&s;ed by other of their Parti|zans who joined them.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> who was going through the City on &s;ome Diver&s;ion with &s;everal of his Compa|nions, and a few Attendants, happened to pa&s;s by while the Combatants were engaged; this Sight gave him great Affliction, as he had Hopes from the Friar's Endeavours, that Peace would have been made between their Families; being de&s;irous therefore of putting an End to the Fight, he turned to his Companions and Servants, and &s;peaking &s;o loud that he was heard by many in the Street; "Brothers, &s;aid he, let us thru&s;t our&s;elves between them, and try, if by any Means we can oblige them to lay down their Arms:" With the&s;e Words he pre&s;&s;ed in among the Combatants, followed by his Friends and Servants, labouring both with Words and Actions to prevail upon them to cea&s;e their Contention; but his Entreaties and Endeavours were all ineffectual; their Fu|ry had ri&s;en to &s;uch Exce&s;s, that they minded nothing but how to be revenged on each other, many of each Party lying dead upon the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="71">While <HI>Romeo</HI> was thus generou&s;ly employed in endeavouring to calm their Rage, the fu|rious <HI>Tibbald</HI> drew near him, and gave him a thru&s;t with his Sword in the Side, which, by Rea&s;on of a net-work of Steel he wore beneath his Cloaths, did him no Harm.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> notwith&s;tanding this Outrage, turn|ing towards him, &s;aid, with a friendly Ac|cent, <HI>"Tibbald,</HI> if you believe I came hither with any Intention to fight with you, or any of your Party, you are much deceived: I pa&s;&s;ed this Way by Chance, and have no other De&s;ign in mixing among you, but to make tho&s;e who belong to me retire."</P>
<P><HI>Tibbald,</HI> either not under&s;tanding the&s;e Words, or &s;eeming not to under&s;tand them, cried out, "Ah Traitor, thou &s;halt die! and furiou&s;ly throwing him&s;elf upon <HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;truck him with great Violence on the Head, but the Force of the Blow, though weakened by the &s;teel Head-piece he wore, yet &s;o enraged <HI>Ro|meo,</HI> that, wrapping his Cloak about his Arm by Way of Shield, he turned the point of his Sword towards his Enemy, which piercing his Throat, went quite through his Neck, and came out behind, &s;o that the unhappy <HI>Tibbald</HI> fell dead immediately on the Earth.</P>
<P>The Guards approaching at the Report of this Battle, the Combatants di&s;per&s;ed different Ways; and <HI>Romeo,</HI> full of Grief for having killed <HI>Tibbald,</HI> fled to the Church of St. <HI>Fran|cis,</HI> followed by a great many of his Friends and Servants.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI> was much affected at the News of <HI>Tibbald</HI>'s Death, which put it out of
<PB N="57" REF="72">
his Power to accompli&s;h the Peace he medita|ted between them; however, he received <HI>Ro|meo</HI> with great Kindne&s;s, and concealed him in his Chamber at the Convent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capelletti</HI> a&s;&s;embling together, went to complain to Signor <HI>Bartholomew</HI> of the In|jury they had &s;uffered from <HI>Romeo</HI>; and the Father of <HI>Romeo,</HI> together with all the Per&s;ons of Quality among the <HI>Montecchi,</HI> went al&s;o to prove that <HI>Romeo</HI> had not engaged in the Fight, but &s;ought only to part the Combatants, and being ba&s;ely wounded by <HI>Tibbald,</HI> killed him in his own Defence.</P>
<P>Although it was made very clear, that the <HI>Capelletti</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Montecchi</HI> fir&s;t, and al|&s;o proved by many Witne&s;&s;es, that <HI>Romeo</HI> en|deavoured to part them, and was wounded by <HI>Tibbald</HI> while he was thus employed, yet Sig|nor <HI>Bartholomew</HI> bani&s;hed him from <HI>Verona,</HI> and ordered the re&s;t to forbear &s;uch Ho&s;tilities for the future.</P>
<P>The Death of <HI>Tibbald</HI> cau&s;ed great Affliction in the Family of the <HI>Capelletti</HI>; but <HI>Jullietta</HI> wept not for her Cou&s;in's Death, but for the Bani&s;hment of <HI>Romeo</HI>; having however that Excu&s;e for her Sorrow, &s;he gave free Vent to her Tears, and lo&s;ing all the Hopes &s;he had formerly entertained of being happy with her beloved <HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;he wholly abandoned her&s;elf to Grief.</P>
<P>Under&s;tanding that he was concealed in Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI>'s Convent, &s;he wrote a Letter to him, filled with moving Complaints of their mi&s;erable Fortune, intreating him with the mo&s;t tender In&s;tances of Affection, that he
<PB N="58" REF="73">
would allow her to accompany him in his Ba|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> received this Letter by the Hands of the old Woman who was the Confidant of their Marriage; and in his An&s;wer, he con|jured his dear <HI>Julietta</HI> not to afflict her&s;elf; that in a proper Time he would do all &s;he de&s;ired; but at pre&s;ent he had not fixed upon the Place of his Exile, though he was re&s;olved it &s;hould be as near her as po&s;&s;ible; and concluded with earne&s;tly de&s;iring her to give him an Oppor|tunity of &s;eeing her before he went away.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> naming the Garden for the Place of this la&s;t &s;ad Interview, <HI>Romeo,</HI> at the ap|pointed Hour, came &s;ecretly out of the Convent by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Father <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and, at|tended by his faithful <HI>Pietro,</HI> came to the Place where he was expected.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> received him with a Flood of Tears, and Grief &s;o totally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their Souls, that they continued a long Time unable to &s;peak to each other; recovering a little from this &s;i|lent Exce&s;s of Sorrow, they flew into each others Arms, mingling Tears with their Em|braces, and bitter Complaints again&s;t the Cruelty of their Fortune.</P>
<P>Great Part of the Night being wa&s;ted in this Manner, <HI>Julietta,</HI> with the mo&s;t earne&s;t and affecting Intreaties, urged her beloved <HI>Romeo</HI> to permit her to go with him into Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Do not, my Lord, cried &s;he, do not leave me behind you; I will cut off this long Hair, and dre&s;&s;ed in the Habit of a Boy, follow you wherever you go; my tender Cares &s;hall &s;often the Rigour of your Exile; can you have
<PB N="59" REF="74">
a more faithful Servant than me? Oh, my deare&s;t Hu&s;band, grant me this Favour, I con|jure you; let me &s;hare your Fate whatever it be; I cannot be unhappy if I am with you."</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> with the tendere&s;t Language that Love could dictate, endeavoured to comfort his afflicted Wife; he a&s;&s;ured her that his Sen|tence of Bani&s;hment would be &s;hortly revoked; the Prince had given his Father &s;ome Rea&s;on to expect it; "But happen what will, &s;aid he, my lovely <HI>Julietta,</HI> not in the Habit of a Page can I con&s;ent to &s;ee you; no, when you do come, it mu&s;t be in a Manner &s;uitable to the Dignity of your Birth, and the Quality of your Hu&s;band: Depend upon it, continued he, my Bani&s;hment will not continue more than a Year; in that Time our Parents may be reconciled; the Prince him&s;elf will labour to make Peace between them; but if the&s;e Hopes fail me, I will then take another Cour&s;e, for it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be able to live long without you."</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> yielding to the Force of the&s;e Rea|&s;ons and Per&s;ua&s;ions, they began to &s;ettle the Method of corre&s;ponding by Letters; and the Morn now breaking, amid&s;t thou&s;and Sighs, Tears, and tender Embraces, they took Leave of each other; <HI>Romeo</HI> returned to the Con|vent, and <HI>Julietta</HI> to her Chamber.</P>
<P>In two or three Days, every Thing being prepared for his Departure, <HI>Romeo</HI> left the Convent, and, di&s;gui&s;ed like a foreign Mer|chant, went privately out of <HI>Verona</HI>: Several of his mo&s;t faithful Friends conducted him &s;afely to <HI>Mantua</HI>; where he hired a magnifi|cent
<PB N="60" REF="75">
Hou&s;e, and having large Appointments from his Father, lived with a Splendor befit|ting his Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> in the mean Time, gave her&s;elf wholly up to Sorrow; &s;he loathed her Food; Sleep fled from her Eyes; &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the Days in Sighs and Tears, and the Nights in Com|plaints and Lamentations. Her Mother ob|&s;erving her continual Grief, reproved her for it many Times; telling her, &s;he had wept enough for the Death of her Cou&s;in, and that it was Time to put an End to her Affliction upon his Account.&mdash;<HI>Julietta</HI> replied, that &s;he knew no Cau&s;e for Affliction; neverthele&s;s &s;he continued to fly from all Company and Diver&s;ion, and gave her&s;elf up entirely a Prey to Sadne&s;s and Tears; her fixed Melancholy making &s;o great an Alteration in her lovely Face, that &s;he no longer had any Re&s;emblance of the once gay and beautiful <HI>Julietta.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> never failed to make U&s;e of every Opportunity to write to her, always comfort|ing her in his Letters with Hopes of being &s;oon together, and tenderly intreating her to moderate her Affliction, and become ea&s;y and chearful as &s;he was wont to be; but all was in vain; the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Romeo</HI> was the Cau&s;e of her Unhappine&s;s, and till that was removed &s;he was incapable of receiving any Comfort.</P>
<P>Her Mother at la&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing the Sadne&s;s of her Daughter proceeded from her Di&s;content at &s;eeing &s;o many of her young Companions married, while &s;he had no Hu&s;band propo&s;ed to her, acquainted her Spou&s;e, the Lord <HI>Ca|pellet,</HI> with her Su&s;picions:&mdash;"Our Daugh|ter,
<PB N="61" REF="76">
&s;aid &s;he, does nothing but &s;igh and weep; I have frequently a&s;ked her the Cau&s;e of this immoderate Affliction; &s;he an&s;wers me always in the &s;ame Tone, that &s;he knows of no Cau&s;e; yet every one in the Hou&s;e perceives her continual Melancholy; certainly &s;ome vio|lent Unea&s;ine&s;s preys upon her Heart; and if &s;he is &s;uffered to go on thus, &s;he will con&s;ume away in&s;en&s;ibly like Wax before the Fire: I have imagined a thou&s;and Rea&s;ons for this her Sorrow; but what &s;eems to me to be the mo&s;t probable is, that having &s;ince la&s;t Carnival, &s;een all her Companions become Wives, &s;he is afflicted becau&s;e a Hu&s;band has not yet been propo&s;ed to her; &s;he will be eighteen Years of Age St. <HI>Euphemia</HI>'s Day next, and in my O|pinion it is now Time we &s;hould procure her a good and honourable Hu&s;band, for a young Virgin is not Merchandize that will keep long in a Hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Since it is your Opinion, replied the Lord <HI>Antonio</HI> to his Wife, that this Melan|choly of our Daughter is cau&s;ed by her not having a Hu&s;band propo&s;ed to her, I will en|deavour to procure one &s;uitable to the Dignity of our Hou&s;e; but let it be your Care to find out whether her Affections are yet engaged, that I may propo&s;e &s;uch a Match to her as may be agreeable to her Inclinations."</P>
<P><HI>Giovanni</HI> replied, that &s;he would do all in her Power to &s;atisfy him in this Particular; and accordingly &s;he again que&s;tioned all <HI>Ju|lietta</HI>'s Attendants, and every other Per&s;on in the Hou&s;e, who &s;he thought was likely to give her any Information; but could di&s;cover nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="77">Some Time after this, a Match was pro|po&s;ed to Lord <HI>Antonio,</HI> between the young <HI>Paris,</HI> Count of <HI>Lodrona,</HI> and his Daughter.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Antonio</HI> was extremely well plea&s;ed with the Propo&s;al, the Count being young, hand&s;ome and very rich; and de&s;ired his Lady to acquaint her Daughter with the advanta|geous Offer that was made her.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Giovanni</HI> did as &s;he was directed; but <HI>Julietta</HI> received this News with &s;uch appa|rent Grief, that her Mother, after long en|deavouring in vain to find out the Cau&s;e, &s;aid at la&s;t, "By what I can under&s;tand then, my Daughter, you are not willing to be married."</P>
<P>"It is true, Madam, replied <HI>Julietta,</HI> I never intend to marry any one; and if you love me, and have any Regard for my Peace, you will not think of giving me a Hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"Will you be a Nun then, replied the Mother, in great Amazement; tell me what are your Intentions?"&mdash;"I will not be a Nun, &s;aid <HI>Julietta</HI>; I know not what I would be; but I long to be in my Grave."</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Giovanni,</HI> equally &s;urprized and of|fended at this An&s;wer, was at a Lo&s;s what to &s;ay or do.&mdash;She again enquired of her Daugh|ter's Attendants if they knew the Cau&s;e of her extreme Melancholy.&mdash;They replied, that ever &s;ince her Cou&s;in <HI>Tibbald</HI>'s Death, &s;he had wholly abandoned her&s;elf to Sorrow, was al|ways in Tears, and &s;ought all Occa&s;ions of being alone.</P>
<P><HI>Giovanni</HI> relating all this to her Hu&s;band: He ordered <HI>Julietta</HI> to be called, and, after &s;ome little Di&s;cour&s;e with her, "Daughter,
<PB N="63" REF="78">
&s;aid he, you are now old enough to be married; I have found a Hu&s;band for you, who is young, hand&s;ome, noble and rich; it is the Count of <HI>Lodrona</HI>; di&s;po&s;e your&s;elf therefore to comply with my Will in this Affair, &s;uch Matches offer but &s;eldom."</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> with more Spirit than became one of her Years, replied boldly, that &s;he would not marry.</P>
<P>Her Father, greatly enraged, was ready to beat her; but checking his Fury a little, he contented him&s;elf with threatening her with the mo&s;t cruel Effects of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, if &s;he continued di&s;obedient, and concluded with telling her, that whether &s;he was willing or not &s;he mu&s;t prepare in a few Days to go with him, her Mother, and other Relations to <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> to meet the young Count, who would be there with a great Retinue on Pur|po&s;e to &s;ee her; adding, that if &s;he made any Reply, or Re&s;i&s;tance, he would break her Head, and make her the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Crea|ture that ever was born.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> remained like one Thunder-&s;truck, at this cruel Language, and, not daring to re|ply, &s;he retired to her Chamber, and there wrote an Account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Romeo.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;hort Time &s;he received an An&s;wer from her beloved Hu&s;band, who earne&s;tly con|jured her not to afflict her&s;elf, but to depend upon the Promi&s;e he made her, to come &s;oon to <HI>Verona,</HI> and take her away privately to <HI>Mantua.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79">While &s;he waited the Effect of this Pro|mi&s;e, the Day approached on which &s;he was to go to <HI>Villa-Franca,</HI> where her Father had a fine Seat. Notwith&s;tanding her great Reluctance, &s;he was obliged to go, and the young Count of <HI>Lodrona,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;aw her at Church, was &s;o &s;truck with her Charms, though now a little impaired by her continual Grief, that he immediately concluded the Marriage Treaty with her Father; who re|turned with <HI>Julietta</HI> to <HI>Verona.</HI> Here he in|formed her, that her Marriage with the Count was ab&s;olutely re&s;olved upon, exhorting her to be chearful, and &s;ubmit to his Will with a good Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> made no An&s;wer, but retired to her Chamber, in order to conceal her Af|fliction, being informed that her Nuptials with Count <HI>Paris</HI> were to be celebrated in a few Weeks. Not knowing what to do in this terrible Extremity, &s;he at la&s;t re&s;olved to go to Father <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and con&s;ult with him upon Means to avoid this dete&s;ted Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next Saint's Day &s;he went to her Mother's Chamber. "My dear Mother, &s;aid &s;he at her Entrance, I cannot imagine how this &s;trange Melancholy has grown upon me, but ever &s;ince the Death of my Cou&s;in <HI>Tibbald</HI> I have been able to take no Plea&s;ure in any Thing, and my De|jection encrea&s;es every Day; I think I will go on this ble&s;&s;ed Saint's Day to Confe&s;&s;i|on; perhaps I may receive &s;ome Con&s;ola|tion by that Means. What &s;ay you, my
<PB N="65" REF="80">
&s;weet Mother, are you plea&s;ed with this Pro|po&s;ition? Shall I go?"</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Giovanni,</HI> who was a very pious Woman, greatly approved of her Daughter's Intention, and went with her to the Church of St. <HI>Francis</HI>; where, ordering Father <HI>Lo|renzo</HI> to be called, &s;he permitted <HI>Julietta</HI> to go into the Confe&s;&s;ionary, and being entered; "My Father, &s;aid the afflicted <HI>Julietta,</HI> no one knows better than your&s;elf, what has pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Romeo</HI> and me, therefore it is needle&s;s to repeat it; you have no doubt read the Letter, which I put into your Hand to be &s;ent to him; in which I informed him, that my Father had promi&s;ed me to <HI>Paris,</HI> Count of <HI>Lodrona. Romeo</HI> writes to me, that he will &s;hortly come and take Mea&s;ures to prevent this ever happening; but alas! Heaven knows when he will perform his Promi&s;e; the Day of my Nuptials is now fixed; I &s;ee no Way to avoid the hated Count, who appears to me as a Robber and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. You know that I am the Wife of <HI>Romeo,</HI> and that I cannot be another's; no, I will be my dear <HI>Romeo</HI>'s eternally, this is my fixed Re&s;o|&s;olution; to you therefore I come for Ad|vice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; hear fir&s;t, however, what I propo&s;e. You &s;hall, my dear Father, pro|vide me a Suit of Boys Cloaths, in which I will leave my Father's Hou&s;e very early in the Morning, and thus di&s;gui&s;ed travel to <HI>Man|tua,</HI> and keep my&s;elf concealed in the Hou&s;e of my dear <HI>Romeo."</HI></P>
<P>The Friar, who was not at all plea&s;ed with this Propo&s;ition, replied&mdash;"My dear Daugh|ter,
<PB N="66" REF="81">
it is impo&s;&s;ible to execute, with Safety, the De&s;ign you have formed, the Dangers are too great; you are very young, your Per|&s;on and Con&s;ttiution extremely delicate; you could not endure the Fatigue of &s;uch a Journey; you have never been accu&s;tomed to walk, and not being acquainted with the Way, would wander here and there, without knowing whither to go: Your Father would no &s;ooner mi&s;s you, than he would &s;end People to the City Gates, and into all the Streets to find you, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape the Search. When you are brought back, will not your Father, by Threats, and perhaps Blows, force you to declare the Rea&s;on of your Flight, di&s;gui&s;ed like a Boy? and when he &s;hall under&s;tand, that you was going to <HI>Romeo,</HI> will not he effectually prevent your ever &s;eeing him more?</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> acquie&s;cing in the&s;e Rea&s;ons of the good Father, replied, "Since you do not approve of what I have propo&s;ed, which I am now convinced is not practicable, give me your Advice what to do; teach me how to untye this cruel Knot, by which, mi&s;era|ble that I am, I find my&s;elf bound; a&s;&s;i&s;t me if po&s;&s;ible to get to my dear <HI>Romeo,</HI> for without him I can no longer live; but if you cannot do that, help me at lea&s;t to the Means of keeping my&s;elf entirely his; my Hu&s;band has told me of your Knowledge of Herbs, and that you can di&s;til a Water which in two Hours time will &s;teal away Life, from the Per&s;on who takes it, without giving any Pain.&mdash;Give me &s;uch a Quantity of this
<PB N="67" REF="82">
Water, as will deliver me from this Count, and make me able to keep my Faith with <HI>Romeo</HI>: If he loves me as I love him, he will rather &s;ee me in the Arms of Death, than in tho&s;e of any other Per&s;on; by helping me to this quiet Death, you will deliver me and my Family from great Di&s;grace, for if I am driven to De&s;pair, and find no other Way to avoid the Mi&s;eries that wait me, I will cut my Throat in the Night, for I am determined to dye, rather than violate my Faith to <HI>Ro|meo."</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who was one of the greate&s;t Chemi&s;ts in his Time, and was well acquainted with the Virtues of Herbs and Stones, among other wonderful Secrets he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of, he had found out and compo&s;ed with many &s;omniferous Simples a certain Pa&s;te, which being reduced to Powder, and a &s;mall Quantity of it mixed with Water, would put the Per&s;on who drank it into a Sleep &s;o like Death, that the mo&s;t &s;kilful Phy&s;ician in the World might be deceived by it, holding them in this &s;weet Trance forty Hours or more, according to the Quantity of the Pow|der, or the Con&s;titution of the Patient. He under&s;tanding, therefore, the fixed Determi|nation of the unhappy <HI>Julietta,</HI> was &s;o moved with Compa&s;&s;ion, that it was with Difficulty he re&s;trained his Tears.</P>
<P>"My Daughter, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t, not think of giving your&s;elf Death, becau&s;e you may depend upon it there is no returning to Life, until the Day of univer&s;al Judgment, when together, with all the Dead, you &s;hall

<P>He then related to her the extraordinary Virtues of the Powder before mentioned, a&s;|&s;uring her that it had been often tried, and always found perfect. "My Daughter, added he, this precious and valuable Powder, will, as I have &s;aid, put you into &s;o &s;ound and quiet a Sleep, that if <HI>Galen, Hippocrates, Me&s;ue, Avicenna,</HI> and all the Colleges of the mo&s;t ex|cellent Phy&s;icians that are, or ever were, were to &s;ee you, and feel your Pul&s;e, they would with one Voice declare you dead. When you have drank the Mixture you will in a few Moments fall a&s;leep; at your u&s;ual Hour of ri&s;ing your Attendants will come to awake you, but not be able; and you being cold as Ice, without Pul&s;e, or any Signs of Life, your Parents, Relations, and all who &s;ee you,
<PB N="69" REF="84">
will believe you to be dead, and you will be carried to the Monument of your Family, there you will quietly repo&s;e the Night and Day: I will take care to di&s;patch a Me&s;&s;en|ger to <HI>Romeo,</HI> and he and I will come the Night following that which you are interred to the Monument; and when the Do&s;e is fully dige&s;ted, you will awake from this artificial Death as fre&s;h and lovely as when you ri&s;e in a Morning from your Bed, after a quiet Re&s;t; we will then take you from the Monument, and you &s;hall return with <HI>Romeo</HI> &s;ecretly to <HI>Mantua,</HI> and there remain concealed till the ble&s;&s;ed Peace I am meditating reconciles your two Hou&s;es; but I mu&s;t again repeat to you that Secrecy and Courage is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our De&s;ign, otherwi&s;e you will ruin both your&s;elf and me."</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> who would have pa&s;&s;ed through a glowing Furnace to get to <HI>Romeo,</HI> gave ab&s;o|lute Credit to the Friar's Words, and replied, "Father, I will put my&s;elf entirely into your Hands, and perform whatever you require with the greate&s;t Secrecy."</P>
<P>The Friar then going to the Chamber, re|turned in a few Moments with a &s;ufficient Quantity of the Powder; which he directed her to mix in a Gla&s;s of Water. <HI>Julietta,</HI> with many Thanks, received it, and put it into a Pur&s;e, which &s;he carefully concealed in her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The Friar, who could with Difficulty be|lieve &s;o young a Creature had Fortitude enough to &s;uffer her&s;elf to be interred living in a Sepul|chre with putrefied Carca&s;&s;es, &s;aid to her:</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="85">"But my Daughter, tell me &s;incerely, do you not tremble at the Thoughts of being in|tombed among&s;t mouldering Bodies; where al&s;o the Cor&s;e of your Cou&s;in <HI>Tibbald,</HI> newly &s;lain, is interred?"</P>
<P>"Father, replied the determined <HI>Julietta,</HI> do not trouble your&s;elf about my Fears; if I thought I &s;hould find my <HI>Romeo</HI> by pa&s;&s;ing through the Mid&s;t of infernal Flames, I would without trembling dare the everla&s;ting Fires."</P>
<P>"In the Name of God then, &s;aid the Friar, go on with your Enterprize." Then taking leave of her, he went back to his Chamber, and <HI>Julietta</HI> joined her Mother, who was waiting for her in the Church; and as &s;oon as they were at home, "Certainly, my dear Mother, &s;aid <HI>Julietta,</HI> Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI> is a mo&s;t holy Man; he has comforted me &s;o much by his pious Di&s;cour&s;e, that the terrible Melancholy I have &s;o long laboured under, begins already to abate of its Force."</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Giovanni,</HI> who already perceived an agreeable Change in the Countenance of her Daughter, was extremely plea&s;ed, and thanked God and the good Friar for it a thou&s;and Times; telling her Hu&s;band they ought, in Gratitude for &s;uch a Service from Friar <HI>Lo|renzo,</HI> to make a pre&s;ent to his Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI>'s Chearfulne&s;s per&s;uading both her Father and Mother that there was no Cau&s;e for the Su&s;picion they had entertained of her be|ing &s;ecretly in Love, they began to repent they had entered into &s;uch &s;trict Engagements with the Count of <HI>Lodrona,</HI> becau&s;e the extreme Youth of their Daughter made them willing to
<PB N="71" REF="86">
keep her unmarried two or three Years longer; but the Match having been concluded upon on both Sides, they could not break it off without great Scandal.</P>
<P>The Night before the Day on which the Nuptials were to be celebrated, <HI>Julietta,</HI> who thought every Moment a Year till &s;he drank the Potion, mixed it with &s;ome Water in a Phial, and placed it &s;ecretly at her Bed's Head; the Nur&s;e who lay with her, falling a&s;leep &s;oon after &s;he was in Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> who could not take any Repo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the Night in various and affecting Thoughts; the Dawn approaching, put her in Mind that it was Time to drink the Potion; when the Image of <HI>T&icirc;bbald,</HI> dead as &s;he had lately &s;een him, with the Blood flowing from his Wound, ro&s;e to her Imagination, and re|flecting that &s;he would &s;oon be inclo&s;ed in a dark Monument amid&s;t &s;o many dead Bodies and mouldering Bones, her Blood froze in her Veins, a cold Sweat hung upon all her Limbs, and &s;he began to tremble like a Leaf &s;haken by the Winds.&mdash;"Alas! &s;aid &s;he, &s;oftly &s;igh|ing, what am I going to do? Where &s;hall I &s;uf|fer my&s;elf to be carried? If I &s;hould awake be|fore the Friar and <HI>Romeo</HI> come to take me out of the Monument, what will become of me? How &s;hall I be able to endure the Stench of the dead Body of <HI>Tibbald</HI>! I, who cannot &s;uffer any di&s;agreeable Smell to approach me! who knows how many Serpents and horrid Worms there may be in that Sepulchre! Creatures I &s;o much fear and abhor; and if I am terrified only at the Sight of them, how &s;hall I endure to have
<PB N="72" REF="87">
them &s;tinging and crawling about me? how often have I heard horrid Stories related of dreadful Things which happen in the Night in Churches and Churchyards!"</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many more Thoughts of the like Nature, &s;o tormented her Imagination, that &s;he began to deliberate with her&s;elf whe|ther &s;he &s;hould not throw away that terrible Potion.</P>
<P>Continuing thus irre&s;olute a long Time, her fervent Love for <HI>Romeo</HI> at la&s;t got the bet|ter of her Fears, and the Day now &s;hining through her Window, &s;he took the Phial from her Pillow, and couragiou&s;ly drank off the Li|quor, which, in a few Moments, produc|ing its u&s;ual Effects, &s;he fell in a profound Sleep.</P>
<P>Her Nur&s;e, who had been &s;en&s;ible &s;he had &s;lept but little in the Night, thinking &s;he was now repo&s;ing, ro&s;e &s;oftly for Fear of di|&s;turbing her, and went about her u&s;ual Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and when it was Time to awake her, &s;he returned to her Chamber, &s;aying as &s;he entered, "Up, up you Slug-a-bed, its Time to ri&s;e;" then opening the Window, and per|ceiving <HI>Julietta</HI> did not yet move, &s;he ap|proached the Bed, crying "Ri&s;e, ri&s;e you lazy ones;" but the good old Woman was calling to the Deaf;&mdash;then rai&s;ing her Voice, &s;he called her aloud, &s;haking her to di&s;&s;ipate her Sleep; but all her vital Faculties were &s;o bound up, that the loude&s;t and mo&s;t horrible Thunders would not have been able to awake her.</P>
<P>The poor old Woman believing her now to be certainly dead, bur&s;t into Tears and
<PB N="73" REF="88">
Complaints, and went to acquaint the unhap|py Mother with the News, who, flying with di&s;tracted Pace to <HI>Julietta</HI>'s Chamber, and be|holding her &s;tretched breathle&s;s upon the Bed, &s;he filled the Air with dreadful Shrieks, utter|ing &s;uch moving Expre&s;&s;ions of Sorrow as might have &s;oftened the Rage of Tygers them|&s;elves. The Tears and Groans of the Nur&s;e, and piercing Cries of the wretched Mother, brought all the Family to the Chamber, and among the re&s;t the Lord <HI>Antonio,</HI> who ap|proaching the Bed, and finding his Daughter without Sen&s;e or Motion, and cold as Ice, A|&s;toni&s;hment and Grief made him for &s;ome Mo|ments immoveable as a Statue.</P>
<P>The &s;ad News being &s;pread through the Ci|ty, all the Relations and Friends of the Fami|ly ha&s;tened to Lord <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and filled it with Tears and Lamentations; the mo&s;t fa|mous Phy&s;icians were immediately &s;ent for; but all their Art proved ineffectual, and they declared &s;he was ab&s;olutely dead.</P>
<P>At this cruel Confirmation of their Fears, their Weepings and Lamentations redoubled; the whole City took Part in the Grief of this Family, and every one bewailed the unexpect|ed Death of the young and beautiful <HI>Julietta.</HI></P>
<P>But what Words can expre&s;s the deep Di|&s;tre&s;s, the wild Affliction of the wretched Mo|ther! deaf to all the Con&s;olation that was of|fered to her, &s;he gave a Loo&s;e to De&s;pair: Now in the wild Agony of Grief &s;he tore her Hair, and &s;hrieking, pierced the Skies with her Complaints; now &s;inking under the Load of unutterable Sorrow, with Eyes &s;treaming
<PB N="74" REF="89">
with Tears, and Sighs which &s;eemed to &s;hake her whole Frame, &s;he &s;ilently bewailed her Lo&s;s; three Times &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the Bed, and cla&s;ping the cold <HI>Julietta</HI> to her &s;ob|bing Bo&s;om, fell breathle&s;s on the Body, and was with Difficulty brought back to Life.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Antonio,</HI> who had tenderly loved his Daughter, was no le&s;s afflicted for her Death, than his Wife; but &s;trove with manly Forti|tude to conceal his Angui&s;h in his own Brea&s;t in order to quiet her's.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI> wrote to <HI>Romeo</HI> all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and <HI>Ju|lietta</HI>; he de&s;ired him to come the next Night, di&s;gui&s;ed, to <HI>Verona,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in taking his Wife from the Tomb, and carry her with him to <HI>Mantua.</HI></P>
<P>This Letter he gave to a faithful Brother of the Order, &s;trictly charging him to ha&s;ten with it to <HI>Mantua,</HI> and give it to <HI>Romeo Mon|tecchio,</HI> and no other Per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>The Friar accordingly departed for <HI>Mantua</HI>; and arriving there in good Time, alighted at the Convent of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> with an Intention to de&s;ire the Superior to let one of the Brothers accompany him into the City, where he had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act.</P>
<P>It happened, that a Friar of that Con|vent was ju&s;t then dead; and becau&s;e it was &s;u&s;pected, from &s;ome Marks on his Body, that he died of the Plague, the Deputies of Health, the &s;ame Moment that the <HI>Verone&s;e</HI> Friar ar|rived, came to the Superior, with Orders from the Lord of the City, that he &s;hould not &s;uffer any one belonging to his Convent to &s;tir
<PB N="75" REF="90">
out upon any Occa&s;ion whatever, for fear of &s;preading the Contagion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Verone&s;e</HI> Friar, in vain repre&s;ented to the Deputies, that he was but ju&s;t arrived from <HI>Verona,</HI> and had not yet &s;poke with any Per&s;on in the Convent; they obliged him to remain &s;hut up with the other Friars, by which Means he could not deliver the Letter to <HI>Romeo</HI> him&s;elf, and would not, according to his Orders, &s;end it by any other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>While this pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Mantua,</HI> in <HI>Verona</HI> they were making great Preparations for the Funeral Ob&s;equies of <HI>Julietta,</HI> which, agreea|ble to the Cu&s;tom of the Place, were to be performed the Day on which &s;he died.</P>
<P><HI>Pietro,</HI> the faithful Confident of <HI>Romeo,</HI> being then at <HI>Verona,</HI> and hearing that <HI>Julietta</HI> was dead, was almo&s;t out of his Wits for Grief; at fir&s;t he was for going directly to <HI>Mantua,</HI> but upon Reflexion he re&s;olved to &s;tay till &s;he was buried, that he might be able to &s;ay to his Ma&s;ter, he had really &s;een her dead. <HI>Julietta</HI> then was carried with great Pomp to the Mo|nument of the <HI>Capelletti,</HI> amid&s;t the Sighs and Tears of all the Inhabitants of <HI>Verona. Pietro</HI> at this Sight was &s;o lo&s;t in Affliction, re|flecting how ardently &s;he was beloved by his Ma&s;ter, that he never thought of going to Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to con&s;ult with him, as he was accu&s;tomed; but, having &s;een <HI>Julietta</HI> en|tombed, he mounted his Hor&s;e, and rode hard, till he got to <HI>Villa-Franca,</HI> where he &s;topt to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and after a &s;hort Sleep, ri&s;ing two Hours before Day, he remounted his Hor&s;e, and reached <HI>Mantua</HI> at Sun-ri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="91"><HI>Romeo</HI> was &s;till in Bed, when he entered his Chamber; and poor <HI>Pietro</HI> was &s;o much affected with the &s;ad News he brought, that for &s;ome Moments he was unable to utter a Word; but his Sighs, and the Tears which ran down in great Abundance from his Eyes, per&s;uaded his Ma&s;ter, that &s;ome ill Accident had happened, though he was far from gue&s;|&s;ing at the real one; yet with &s;ome Impati|ence, he a&s;ked him, "If his Father, and all his Friends at <HI>Verona</HI> were well" "Speak," added he, beginning to be more alarmed; find|ing he &s;till continued &s;ilent and weeping, "Keep me no longer in Su&s;pence, but tell me what is the Cau&s;e of that Affliction I &s;ee you in."</P>
<P><HI>Pietro</HI> with a faultering Voice, then told him, that <HI>Julietta</HI> was dead, that he had &s;een her laid in the Monument of the <HI>Capelletti,</HI> and that it was reported in <HI>Verona,</HI> that Grief was the Cau&s;e of her Death.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;truck as with a Thunder-bolt at this dreadful News, remained for &s;ome Time in a &s;peechle&s;s Agony of Grief; then furiou&s;ly &s;pringing out of his Bed, "Ah Traitor! cried he aloud, cruel, perfidious and ingrateful <HI>Romeo,</HI> it was not Sorrow that killed thy Wife, Grief is not &s;o quick a Murderer! Ah! no, it was thy Cruelty that killed her: Did &s;he not tell thee in her Letters, &s;he would dye rather than be the Wife of any other, and earne&s;tly entreat thee to come, and take her from her Father's Hou&s;e, and thou, unworthy lingering Lover, amu&s;ed her with vain Promi&s;es, but had not Re&s;olution enough to perform them, and do&s;t thou now
<PB N="77" REF="92">
&s;tand idly weeping, and <HI>Julietta</HI> dead!&mdash;Oh my <HI>Julietta</HI>! cried he, rai&s;ing his Voice, art thou dead, and do I live!&mdash;Ah Wretch! how often have I told her, that I could not live without her, and yet I live, I breathe, and &s;he is dead!&mdash;Where is &s;he, added he, gaz|ing wildly round the Room, is &s;he not here, here hovering about me, expecting me to fol|low her!&mdash;Hark; &s;he calls me, behold, &s;he &s;ays, behold me here, deceitful Lover and un|faithful Hu&s;band. Oh pardon me! my deare&s;t Wife; I own my Guilt, and &s;ince Grief is not powerful enough to deprive me of Life; my own Hand &s;hall perform that Office, and do what Grief is not able to do."&mdash;This &s;aid, he &s;uddenly &s;natched his Sword from the Head of his Bed and turned the Point of it to his Bo&s;om; but <HI>Pietro</HI> &s;pringing ha&s;tily to him pu&s;hed the Sword out of his Hand, endeavour|ing by all the &s;oft Per&s;ua&s;ions he was Ma&s;ter of to prevail upon him to change his dread|ful Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> overwhelmed with unutterable An|gui&s;h, &s;tood &s;ilent and motionle&s;s all the Time he was &s;peaking, re&s;embling more a Marble Statue than a living Man; at la&s;t the &s;tubborn Sorrow found a vent, and his Eyes, at once unlocking all their Springs, poured out a River of Tears.</P>
<P>Though the Frenzy of his Sorrow was by this Means &s;omewhat allayed, yet De&s;pair had taken &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul, that he was fixed in his Re&s;olution not to live, but care|fully concealing his De&s;ign, le&s;t he &s;hould be prevented from executing it, he charged

<HI>Pietro,</HI> with a di&s;&s;embled Calmne&s;s in his Looks and Voice, not to mention the Death of his Wife, and the fatal Error he had like to have been guilty of, to any Per&s;on whatever, but to mount a fre&s;h Hor&s;e, and &s;et out immediately for <HI>Verona,</HI> whither he would follow him&mdash;"Let not my Father know, continued he, that I am coming, but provide me &s;ome In&s;truments for opening the Sepulchre, where my <HI>Julietta</HI> is interred, and wait for me at the Out-Hou&s;e behind our Garden; I will meet you there, and we will go together to the Monument of the <HI>Capelleti,</HI> for I mu&s;t once more have a Sight of my deare&s;t Wife, pale and cold as &s;he now lies in Death, then early in the Morning I will return to <HI>Mantua,</HI> and you may follow a little Time after." <HI>Pietro,</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting his Intention, departed immediately to perform his Commi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Romeo,</HI> as &s;oon as he was gone, wrote a Letter to his Father, in which he entreated his Pardon for having married without a&s;king his Con&s;ent, and related at large his Love for <HI>Juli|etta,</HI> their Marriage, and the fatal Con&s;equen|ces; he conjured him al&s;o, &s;ince <HI>Julietta</HI> had been his Daughter to have perpetual Ma&s;&s;es &s;aid for her Soul, and in order to reward the Fidelity of his Servant <HI>Pietro,</HI> he de&s;ired that a hand&s;ome Provi&s;ion might be made for him out of the E&s;tate which had been bequeathed him by an Aunt lately decea&s;ed, and &s;ince he had yet received no Part of it, he ordered the fir&s;t Rents to be given to the Poor; having de|clared this to be his la&s;t Will, he earne&s;tly en|treated his Father, to fulfil it in every particu|lar; then clo&s;ing the Letter, he &s;ealed it, and put
<PB N="79" REF="94">
it in his Bo&s;om. This done, he gave Orders to have a Hor&s;e made ready, and, telling his Ser|vants he would return the next Day, he put on the Habit of a <HI>German</HI> Soldier, and, taking with him a Phial full of Mortal Poi&s;on, he mounted his Hor&s;e, and took the Road to <HI>Verona.</HI> Having rode pretty fa&s;t, he arrived there in the Evening, and went to the Hou&s;e where he had appointed to meet <HI>Pietro,</HI> who having provided every Thing that he had been commanded, they went together at four o'Clock in the Morning to the Churchyard, which was in the Citadel, and got to the Monu|ment of the <HI>Capelletti</HI> without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Vault being opened, without much Dif|ficulty, with the In&s;truments they had brought with them, they propt up the Top with Poles, and <HI>Romeo</HI> taking a dark Lanthorn, which <HI>Pietro</HI> had al&s;o provided, he de&s;cended into the Vault: Here he beheld his Wife dead as &s;he appeared, and &s;tretched out upon her Bier.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> at this Sight fell fainting upon her Brea&s;t, and continued for &s;ome Moments in a Death more real than hers; recovering at la&s;t to a painful Sen&s;e of agonizing Woe, he took his Wife in his Arms, and holding her clo&s;e pre&s;t to his Bo&s;om, bathed her cold Face with his Tears, which flowed in &s;uch Abundance, that for a long Time he was not able to utter a Word; but when he recovered the U&s;e of Speech, he broke into &s;uch moving Com|plaints, as might have &s;oftened the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t impenetrable Souls to Compa&s;&s;ion. Con|tinuing &s;till fixed in his Re&s;olution to dye, he took the Phial out of his Pocket, and drank off the fatal Draught in a Moment, then a&s;cend|ing

a few Steps, he called to <HI>Pietro,</HI> who was &s;tanding in a Corner of the Church-yard.&mdash; <HI>"Pietro,</HI> &s;aid he, when he approached, behold here my Wife, how much I did and do love her, thou partly knowe&s;t; thou knowe&s;t al&s;o, that it is as much impo&s;&s;ible for me to live without her, as it is for a Body to live with|out a Soul; I therefore brought with me a Poi&s;on, which in le&s;s than half an Hour procures a certain Death; this I have glad|ly drank this Moment, that dying near her, whom in Life I &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately adored, I may remain with her dead, &s;ince my cruel De&s;tiny would not permit us to live together.&mdash; See, there is the Phial, which I have emptied, it was given me thou may'&s;t remember by a Mountebank in <HI>Mantua,</HI> who came from <HI>Spoletta,</HI> and brought with him living A&s;picks and other Serpents, the Water it contained was di&s;tilled from tho&s;e Creatures and other Serpents.

No, my weeping proceeds from the Angui&s;h I feel for the untimely Death of her, who was worthy of a much longer, and much more happy Life.

<P><HI>Romeo</HI> then, in a few Words, telling her what he had done, and the Cau&s;e of it&mdash; "Alas! alas! cried the mi&s;erable <HI>Julietta,</HI> what do I hear!&mdash;Oh what is it you tell me!&mdash; By what I under&s;tand then, Father <HI>Lorenzo</HI> did not write you an Account of the Mea&s;ures he and I had taken, though he promi&s;ed me faithfully to do &s;o."</P>
<P>Here <HI>Julietta,</HI> weeping &s;ighing, and bit|terly complaining, amid&s;t interrupting bur&s;ts of Sorrow, recounted all that the Friar and &s;he had done to avoid being married to the young Nobleman her Father had provided for her.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> hearing this, felt his Grief and Ago|ny redoubled; and while <HI>Julietta</HI> with Heart-piercing Groans lamented their unhappy Fate, calling the Heavens, the Stars, and all the Elements mo&s;t cruel and unmerciful, her dying Hu&s;band, ob&s;erving the Corp&s;e of <HI>Tibbald</HI> lying near him, turned towards it&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh <HI>Tibbald,</HI> &s;aid he, if in thy pre&s;ent State thou art capable of knowing any Thing, thou mu&s;t know that I &s;ought not to offend thee; but that my Intention, by mixing in the Combat, was to per&s;uade thy Party to retire, and mine to lay down their Arms; but thou, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by long hereditary Hatred again&s;t me, a&s;&s;aulted me cruelly with mo&s;t untameable Ma|lice; then lo&s;ing all Patience, I &s;corned to

<P><HI>Pietro,</HI> at this piteous Di&s;cour&s;e of the dy|ing Hu&s;band, and the piercing Cries and bitter Complaints of the wretched Wife, &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s with Horror and Grief, almo&s;t doubt|ing if the melancholy Scene he beheld was real; and not knowing what to &s;ay or do, re|mained fixed like a Statue on the Side of the Monument.</P>
<P>"Oh, <HI>Romeo,</HI> &s;aid the exqui&s;itely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Julietta,</HI> &s;ince it is not the Will of God that we &s;hould live together, I may at lea&s;t be per|mitted to remain with you here; for Oh! be a&s;&s;ured I will never, never for&s;ake you."</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> then taking her in his Arms, began with the gentle&s;t and mo&s;t tender Soothings to calm her Sorrow, and per&s;uade her to live, telling her he could not die in Peace, unle&s;s he was a&s;&s;ured &s;he would pre&s;erve her Life; but while he was &s;peaking, he felt his Strength for|&s;ake him by Degrees, his Eyes grew dim, and all the Powers of his Body &s;o weakened, that

he was no longer able to &s;tand, but letting him&s;elf gently &s;ink on the Ground, and look|ing piteou&s;ly in the Face of his afflicted Wife, "Alas! &s;aid he, my Love,&mdash;I am dying."</P>
<P>Friar <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who, for what Rea&s;on is unknown, was not willing to take <HI>Julietta</HI> out of the Monument, and carry her to his Cham|ber the Night &s;he was interred, the following Night finding <HI>Romeo</HI> did not appear, accom|panied by a faithful Brother of the Order, he came to the Monument with In&s;truments to break open the Vault, and arrived there the &s;ame Moment that <HI>Romeo</HI> &s;unk down upon the Earth, and &s;eeing it already opened, and <HI>Pietro</HI> &s;tanding by it, he a&s;ked him where <HI>Ro|meo</HI> was.</P>
<P><HI>Julietta</HI> hearing the Voice, and knowing is to be the Friar's, rai&s;ing her Head, and weep|ing, &s;aid, "Heaven pardon you, how well you &s;ent the Letter to <HI>Romeo!"</HI></P>

<P>"De&s;cend, replied <HI>Julietta,</HI> (redoubling her Tears) and &s;ee."</P>
<P>The Friar going down, immediately per|ceived <HI>Romeo</HI> &s;tretched out, having yet &s;ome &s;mall Remainder of Life; "Oh, my Son! Oh, <HI>Romeo!</HI> cried he, what does this mean?"</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> opening his langui&s;hing Eyes, and knowing the Friar, with Tears which ran fa&s;t down his dying Cheeks, recommended <HI>Ju|lietta</HI> to his Care, and devoutly a&s;ked Pardon of God and him for the Offence he had been guilty of in ha&s;tening his own Death.</P>

<P>The two Friars and <HI>Pietro,</HI> wholly &s;ubdued by Grief, wept exce&s;&s;ively at this di&s;mal Scene; yet they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours to comfort her, but all in vain.</P>
<P>"My Daughter, &s;aid Father <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> what is done cannot now be undone: If Tears could recal thy <HI>Romeo</HI> to Life, ours &s;hould flow as fa&s;t as thine; but there is no Remedy for what is pa&s;t; comfort thy&s;elf then and re|&s;olve to live; and if thou art not willing to return to thy Father's Hou&s;e, I will place thee in a holy Mona&s;tery, where thou may'&s;t &s;pend the Remainder of thy Life in &s;erving God, and praying for the Soul of <HI>Romeo."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julietta,</HI> who&s;e Thoughts were wholly &s;wallowed up in the blacke&s;t De&s;pair, heard with gloomy Silence all the Friar had been &s;aying, and, ob&s;tinately bent on Death, col|lecting her whole Force of Grief, and vio|lently re&s;training all the Powers of Life, &s;he expired, holding her <HI>Romeo</HI> fa&s;t locked in her Arms.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the U&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the Incidents in the foregoing Novel, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has formed the Fable of his <HI>Ro|meo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> one of the mo&s;t regular of all his Tragedies. How clo&s;ely he has followed the Story may be partly &s;een by this Tran&s;lation, which is literal from the Original <HI>Italian</HI> of <HI>Bandello</HI>; yet I think it will not be difficult to prove, or at lea&s;t to make it appear highly pro|bable, that he never &s;aw, and did not under&s;tand the Original, but copied from a <HI>French</HI> Tran|&s;lation extant in his Time; or, what is equally probable, from an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation of that <HI>French</HI> one, both very bad, in &s;ome Places rather paraphra&s;ed than tran&s;lated; in others, the Author's Sen&s;e ab&s;olutety mi&s;taken, many Circum&s;tances injudiciou&s;ly added, and many more altered for the wor&s;e, or wholly omitted. The Story of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> may be found tran&s;lated in a Book, entituled, <HI>Hi&s;toires Tra|giques extraictes des Oeuvres de Bandel,</HI> printed in <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Year 1571, &s;even Years after <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was born. A literal Tran&s;lation of
<PB N="90" REF="105">
this Story, from the <HI>French,</HI> is in the &s;econd Tome of the <HI>Palace of Plea&s;ure,</HI> printed at <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1567, which is a Col|lection of Novels, tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by <HI>William Painter,</HI> from &s;everal <HI>Greek, Latin, Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Authors (as the Title Page &s;ays) but &s;ome of them are taken from Tran&s;lations of tho&s;e Authors into <HI>French,</HI> of which <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> is one.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> ever &s;een the original Novel in <HI>Bandello,</HI> he would have been &s;en&s;ible that the Tran&s;lation of it is extremely bad: That he did not &s;ee it, mu&s;t be owing to nothing el&s;e than his not under&s;tanding <HI>Italian</HI>; for can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that having re&s;olved to write a Tragedy upon the Subject of an <HI>Itali|an</HI> Story, he would rather chu&s;e to copy from a bad Tran&s;lation of that Story, than follow the Original.</P>
<P>This Suppo&s;ition would be as ab&s;urd as to imagine a Man would &s;lake his Thir&s;t with the muddy Waters of a polluted Stream, when the clear Spring, from whence it i&s;&s;ues, is with|in his Reach. That <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> con&s;ulted the Tran&s;lator, appears from his having followed him in all the Alterations he has made in the Original; &s;ome few of which I &s;hall take no|tice of, and &s;hew that in &s;ome Places he has not only taken Circum&s;tances from the Tran&s;|lator, but al&s;o made U&s;e of his Thoughts and Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bandello</HI> the Lovers pa&s;s the Night af|ter their Nuptials in the Garden; the Tran&s;|lator makes <HI>Romeo</HI> a&s;cend the Chamber of
<PB N="91" REF="106">
<HI>Julietta,</HI> in which he is followed by <HI>Shake|&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation makes them both com|plain of the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Day, wi&s;h the Sun to ha&s;ten his Cour&s;e, or that they were able to add Wings to his Speed; <HI>Bandello</HI> is &s;ilent upon the Subject, but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> puts al|mo&s;t the &s;ame Words in the Mouth of <HI>Ju|liet.</HI></P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator makes <HI>Juliet,</HI> upon hearing that her Cou&s;in is &s;lain by <HI>Romeo,</HI> break into Complaints and Reproaches again&s;t her Hu&s;|band, and after &s;he has for &s;ome Time given a Loo&s;e to her Re&s;entment, her returning Ten|derne&s;s for <HI>Romeo</HI> forces her to repent of the injurious Words which, in the fir&s;t Emotions of her Grief and Rage, &s;he had uttered again&s;t him; &s;he condemns her&s;elf for her too ha&s;ty Cen&s;ure, and begs Pardon of the ab&s;ent <HI>Romeo</HI> for her unkind Reproaches.</P>
<P>There is not the lea&s;t Foundation for all this in the Original. <HI>Bandello</HI> every where &s;hews <HI>Juliet</HI> &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by her extreme Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Romeo,</HI> that all other Affections, all Tyes of Con&s;anguinity, all filial Duty and Obedience is &s;wallowed up in the Immen&s;ity of her Love; and therefore when the News of <HI>Tibbald</HI>'s Death and <HI>Romeo</HI>'s Bani&s;hment is brought to her at the &s;ame Time, &s;he does not weep for the Death of her Cou&s;in, but for the Bani&s;hment of her Hu&s;band. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has indeed the &s;ame Thought: <HI>Juliet</HI> being told by her Nur&s;e, that her Parents were weeping over the dead Body of <HI>Tibbald,</HI> replies,
<Q><PB N="92" REF="107">
<L>Wa&s;h they his Wound with Tears; mine &s;hall be &s;pent</L>
<L>When their's are dry, for <HI>Romeo</HI>'s Bani&s;h|ment.</L></Q></P>
<P>Her &s;uperior Affection for <HI>Romeo</HI> is al&s;o painted by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in that Speech wherein &s;he laments his Bani&s;hment, and acknowledges it is a greater Misfortune to her than the Death of all her Relations would be; but both the&s;e Circum&s;tances the Tran&s;lator has in common with <HI>Bandello</HI>: He differs from him in making <HI>Juliet</HI> complain of her Hu&s;band's Cruelty in killing her Cou&s;in, and <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has exactly followed that Hint.</P>
<P>When the Father of <HI>Juliet</HI> is informed of his Daughter's Sorrow for having offended him in refu&s;ing Count <HI>Paris</HI> for her Hu&s;band, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes him prai&s;e the good Friar, by whom he &s;uppo&s;es all this Alteration was brought about, in almo&s;t the &s;ame Words of the Tran&s;lator.</P>
<Q><L>Now 'fore God, this reverend holy Friar,</L>
<L>Our whole City is much bound to him.</L></Q>
<P>This is not the fir&s;t Benefit we have receiv|ed from this holy Man, to whom every Citi|zen in this Commonwealth is dearly bound."</P>
<P>But in <HI>Bandello</HI> the Mother of <HI>Juliet</HI> only &s;ays, "That in Gratitude for the Friar's &s;ucce&s;sful Admonitions they ought to make a
<PB N="93" REF="108">
Pre&s;ent to his Mona&s;tery, which was very poor."</P>
<P>In <HI>Bandello,</HI> the Friar, who is &s;ent with the Letters to <HI>Romeo,</HI> is detained at a Mona&s;tery in <HI>Mantua</HI>: The Tran&s;lator makes him be &s;topped at his own Convent in <HI>Verona</HI>; which la&s;t is followed by <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Mention made in the Original of the Apothecary, of whom <HI>Romeo</HI> buys the Poi&s;on; there we are only told that he had mortal Drugs in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was given him by a <HI>Spoletto</HI> Mountebank in <HI>Mantua,</HI> long before.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator makes him walk through the Streets in <HI>Mantua</HI> in order to find a Per&s;on that would &s;ell him &s;uch a Compo&s;ition, and accordingly he goes into the Shop of an Apo|thecary, who&s;e Poverty is ob&s;ervable from the mi&s;erable Furniture of it; and he for a Bribe of fifty Ducats furni&s;hes him with a &s;trong Poi&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has not only copied this Circum|&s;tance from the Tran&s;lator, but al&s;o borrowed &s;ome Hints from him in his celebrated De&s;crip|tion of the mi&s;erable Shop.</P>
<P>The&s;e few In&s;tances are &s;ufficient to prove that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> took the Incidents on which he has founded his Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Ju|liet</HI> from the Tran&s;lation; and con&s;equently that he did not peru&s;e, becau&s;e he did not un|der&s;tand, the original <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>His Management of the Tomb Scene, and the Death of the two Lovers, is entirely co|pied from the Tran&s;lator, who differs greatly from the Original in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances.
<PB N="94" REF="109">
The plain and &s;imple Narration of that melan|choly Event in <HI>Bandello</HI> is more natural, more pathetic, and fitter to excite the Pa&s;&s;ions of Pity and Terror, than the Cata&s;trophe of the Tragedy, as managed by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who has kept clo&s;e by the Tran&s;lator.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bandello,</HI> when <HI>Pietro</HI> informs his Ma&s;ter of <HI>Juliet</HI>'s Death, A&s;toni&s;hment and Grief for &s;ome Moments deprive him of Speech; reco|vering a little, he breaks into Complaints and Self-Reproaches; then, wild with De&s;pair, he flies to his Sword, and endeavours to kill him|&s;elf, but being prevented by his Servant, he &s;inks into an Exce&s;s of &s;ilent Sorrow, and, while he weeps, calmly deliberates on the Means, he &s;hould u&s;e to die in the Monument with <HI>Juliet.</HI></P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator makes <HI>Romeo,</HI> upon receive|ing the fatal News, re&s;olve immediately to poi&s;on him&s;elf; and for that Purpo&s;e <HI>Romeo</HI> di&s;&s;embles his Affliction, and tells his Servant he will go and walk about the Streets of <HI>Man|tua</HI> to divert him&s;elf; but his real De&s;ign is to procure &s;ome Poi&s;on, which having purcha&s;ed of a poor Apothecary, he goes immediately to <HI>Verona.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has here copied the Tran&s;lator exactly, and makes <HI>Romeo</HI> in the Mid&s;t of his Affliction for the Death of his Wife, and while the horrible De&s;ign of killing him&s;elf was forming in his Mind, give a ludicrous Detail of the mi&s;erable Furniture of a poor Apothecary's Shop; a De&s;cription, however beautiful in it&s;elf, is here &s;o ill timed, and &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Condition and Circum|&s;tances
<PB N="95" REF="110">
of the Speaker, that we cannot help being &s;hocked at the Ab&s;urdity, though we admire the Beauty of the Imagination.</P>
<P>There appears &s;o much Contrivance and Method in <HI>Romeo</HI>'s De&s;ign of buying Poi&s;on, and going to <HI>Verona</HI> to drink it in the Monu|ment of his Wife, that he might expire near her, that we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e it to be the &s;pontaneous Effect of a &s;udden and furious Tran&s;port of Grief. In the Original therefore we &s;ee him not taking this Re&s;olution till the fir&s;t violent Sallies of his Sorrow are abated; till after, in a &s;udden Tran&s;port of De&s;pair, he had ineffectually endeavoured to fall upon his Sword; but while he forms that fatally re|gulated De&s;ign, he is di&s;&s;olved in Tears, and plunged in a calm and &s;ilent Exce&s;s of Sor|row.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lator makes <HI>Romeo,</HI> when he breaks open the Monument where <HI>Juliet</HI> lies, command his Servant to be gone and leave him alone, fiercely menacing him with Death if he di&s;obeys.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;poar</HI> does more than imitate him here; for in the Play <HI>Romeo</HI> injudiciou&s;ly adds a Rea|&s;on for that Command; which &s;o far from forcing Obedience, ought rather to have pre|vented it.</P>
<Q><L>The Time and my Intents are &s;avage wild;</L>
<L>More fierce, and more inexorable far</L>
<L>Than empty Tygers, or the roaring Sea.</L></Q>
<P>Yet <HI>Romeo,</HI> a few Lines above in the &s;ame Speech, conde&s;cends to di&s;&s;emble with his
<PB N="96" REF="111">
Servant as to the Cau&s;e of his going into the Monument.</P>
<Q><L>Why I de&s;cend into this Bed of Death,</L>
<L>Is partly to behold my Lady's Face;</L>
<L>But chiefly to take thence from her dead Finger</L>
<L>A precious Ring, a Ring which I mu&s;t u&s;e</L>
<L>In dear Employment.</L></Q>
<P>To pa&s;s by the Ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e Contra|dictions, let us only compare this wild and in|con&s;i&s;tent Behaviour of <HI>Romeo</HI> in the Tran&s;la|tion and the Play, with the calm, &s;edate, yet fixed De&s;pair of <HI>Romeo</HI> in the Original.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he has determined upon the Manner of his Death, he writes an affecting Letter to his Father, in which he relates the Hi&s;tory of his Love and Marriage with <HI>Juliet|ta</HI>; entreats his Pardon for di&s;po&s;ing of him|&s;elf without con&s;ulting him; provides hand|&s;omely for all his Servants, particularly his Confident, <HI>Pietro</HI>; and earne&s;tly entreats that he may be interred in the Monument with <HI>Juliet,</HI> where he goes to die.</P>
<P>This done, taking the Letter and Poi&s;on with him, he goes to <HI>Verona,</HI> opens the Mo|nument by the Help of <HI>Pietro,</HI> and de&s;iring him to watch in the Church-yard le&s;t any Per&s;on &s;hould &s;urprize him, he de&s;cends into the Vault; there, after tenderly gazing on his Wife, and giving &s;ome Moments to the Tears and Complaints which that &s;ad Object drew from him, he drinks off the Poi&s;on; then a&s;cending a few Steps, and leaning on the Side
<PB N="97" REF="112">
of the Monument, he calls his Servant; tells him what he had done; gives him the Letter to his Father; a&s;&s;ures him he will be well pro|vided for, at his dying Reque&s;t; then taking Leave of him, de&s;cends again into the Vault, and cla&s;ping the Body of his Wife in his Arms, calls out to <HI>Pietro</HI> to clo&s;e the Monu|ment upon him, and leave him to expire.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething extremely affecting in this determined, yet calm, and (if the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion may be permitted) gentle De&s;pair of <HI>Romeo,</HI> in the Original: His de&s;iring to have the Monument clo&s;ed upon him, while he is yet alive, that he may expire in the Arms of his beloved <HI>Juliet,</HI> is al&s;o beautifully pathetic, and con&s;i&s;tent with that violent Pa&s;&s;ion he had for her when living.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;la|&s;lations, dies before <HI>Juliet</HI> awakes, and the Friar and <HI>Peter</HI> enters the Monument the &s;ame Moment that he expires; then <HI>Juliet</HI> awaking, they pre&s;s her to leave the Monument, but &s;he refu&s;ing, and they both being alarmed at the Approach of &s;ome Soldiers, cowardly run away, and <HI>Juliet,</HI> left alone, &s;tabs her&s;elf with a Dag|ger.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has copied all the&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces from the Tran&s;lator. <HI>Romeo</HI> dies in the Play before <HI>Juliet</HI> awakes; the Friar fearing to be di&s;covered by the Watch, as he calls it, but there is no &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hment in any of the Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> pre&s;&s;es her to leave the Monument; &s;he refu&s;es; he runs away; and &s;he &s;tabs her&s;elf with <HI>Romeo</HI>'s Dagger.</P>

Arms, and &s;hedding his la&s;t Tears for her Death, &s;he awakes; &s;he opens her Eyes, gazes on him, and entreats him to carry her out of the Monument.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo</HI> is for &s;ome Moments lo&s;t in a Tran|&s;port of Surprize and Joy to &s;ee her alive, but reflecting that he is poi&s;oned, that he mu&s;t &s;hortly die and leave her, his Agonies return with double Force: How pathetically does he complain of his mi&s;erable De&s;tiny! With what tender Exta&s;y does he congratulate her Return to Life! With what affecting Sorrow lament his approaching Death, which mu&s;t tear him from her! nor is the A&s;toni&s;hment, the Grief, and wild De&s;pair of the wretched <HI>Juliet</HI> le&s;s beautifully imagined.</P>
<P>The Speech of <HI>Romeo</HI> to the dead Body of <HI>Tibbald</HI> is very moving, and expre&s;&s;ive of the Gentlene&s;s and Candour of his Di&s;po&s;ition: His &s;inking from the Arms of his Wife when the Poi&s;on begins to exert all its Force; his falling extended at her Feet; gazing on her with a Look that &s;eemed at once to give and a&s;k Compa&s;&s;ion; and ga&s;ping out "Alas! my Love, I die," is pathetic to the la&s;t De|gree.</P>
<P>The Friar the &s;ame Moment arrives at the Monument; <HI>Juliet</HI> hearing his Voice, pa&s;&s;ion|ately upbraids him with not &s;ending to <HI>Romeo</HI>; he ju&s;tifies him&s;elf; de&s;cends into the Vault, and beholding <HI>Romeo</HI> extended almo&s;t lifele&s;s on the Earth, breaks into an Exclamation of Sur|prize and Grief. <HI>Romeo</HI> then opening his Eyes for the la&s;t Time, recommends <HI>Juliet</HI> to
<PB N="99" REF="114">
his Care, and a&s;king Pardon of Heaven for his Offence, expires.</P>
<P>The tender Expo&s;tulations of the Friar with <HI>Juliet</HI> after <HI>Romeo</HI> dies; her gloomy Silence; her fixed De&s;pair; and la&s;tly, her Death, oc|ca&s;ioned by the Violence of her &s;tifled Grief, are Circum&s;tances truly tragical, and wrought up with all the Force of a poetic Imagi|nation.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> ever &s;een the <HI>Italian</HI> Author, the&s;e &s;triking Beauties would not have e&s;caped him; and, if by copying the Tran&s;lation only, he has given us a very affecting Tragedy, what might we not have expected, had he drawn his Hints from the beautiful Original.</P>
<P>How little <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> owed to his own In|vention in his Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> may be &s;een by comparing that Play with the foregoing Novel: What Variations he has made, he was led into by copying from the <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lation, or perhaps from the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> one, in the <HI>Palace of Plea&s;ure,</HI> which is literal from the <HI>French</HI>; and &s;ince it is pretty clear he did not under&s;tand the <HI>Italian,</HI> it is probable he took many more of his Plots from that Book, in which a great Number of the <HI>Italian</HI> Novels are tran&s;lated; &s;ome from <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lations; as <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> and others from the original Authors.</P>
<P>There is not one Incident of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Invention in his Play of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> ex|cept the Death of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Romeo</HI>: This Character might have been very well &s;pared in the Drama; his Appearance is of little U&s;e, and his Death of &s;till le&s;s, except to divert
<PB N="100" REF="115">
our Compa&s;&s;ion from the two principal Per&s;ons in the Play, who&s;e Deaths make up the Ca|ta&s;trophe of the Tragedy.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> &s;eems only introduced to fall by the Hands of <HI>Romeo</HI>; and why mu&s;t our Com|pa&s;&s;ion of the unfortunate <HI>Romeo</HI> be &s;u&s;pended by the unde&s;erved Fate of <HI>Paris?</HI> What Ne|ce&s;&s;ity is there for making <HI>Romeo,</HI> who is all along repre&s;ented as an amiable and virtuous Character, imbrue his Hands in the Blood of an innocent Youth, (who&s;e Death is of no Con&s;equence) ju&s;t before he expires?</P>
<P>This Incident, however, is the only one of the Poet's Invention throughout the Play: The Fable and all the Characters, except <HI>Mer|cutio</HI> were formed to his Hands.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his Preface to his Edition of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays, tells us, that <HI>"Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Characters are Nature her&s;elf; and that it is a Sort of Injury to call them by &s;o di&s;tant a Name as Copies of her."</P>
<P>It is certain, that all the Characters in <HI>Ro|meo,</HI> excepting, as I &s;aid before, <HI>Mercutio</HI>'s, are exact Copies of tho&s;e in the Noveli&s;t; and &s;ince he copied them from the Tran&s;lator, and not the Original, in this In&s;tance Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation of other Authors, may be applied to <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that "His Picture, like a mock Rainbow, is but a Reflexion of a Re|flexion."</P>

<HEAD>The &s;eventh Novel of the third De|cad of the Hecatomythi of <HI>Giraldi Cinthio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN <HI>Venice</HI> there was a <HI>Moor,</HI> who for his extraordinary. Valour, and the many Proofs he had given of his con&s;ummate Pru|dence and &s;uperior Genius for War, was extremely dear to that Republic, which, more than any other, delighted in rewarding great and virtuous Ac|tions.</P>
<P>A <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady of wonderful Beauty, named <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> not &s;ubdued by the irregu|lar Sallies of a female Appetite, but &s;truck with the great Qualities and noble Virtues of the <HI>Moor,</HI> became violently enamoured of him; and he, no le&s;s charmed with the Greatne&s;s of her Mind, than with the extreme Beauty of her Per&s;on, burnt in the mo&s;t ardent Flames for her.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;o far favoured their mutual Pa&s;|&s;ion, that, notwith&s;tanding the united Endea|vours
<PB N="102" REF="117">
of all the Lady's Kindred to prevent it, they found Means to get their Marriage &s;o|lemnized; and during their Abode in <HI>Venice</HI> they lived together in the greate&s;t Harmony and Tranquility imaginable.</P>
<P>It happened, that the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> re|called their Forces which were at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and gave the Command of tho&s;e which were to be &s;ent thither in their &s;tead to the <HI>Moor.</HI></P>
<P>This Dignity was never conferred upon any but Per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable Courage and Fidelity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor</HI> therefore, con&s;idering this Com|mand as a Reward for that Valour he had &s;hewn in the Service of the Republic, received it with great Joy; but when he reflected on the Length and Danger of the Voyage, the Nece&s;&s;ity there &s;eemed of leaving <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> behind him filled him with inconceivable Con|cern.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> who&s;e Felicity wholly centered in the <HI>Moor,</HI> was tran&s;ported to find the Se|nate, by the public Dignity they be&s;towed on him, had given a Sanction to her Choice; and having re&s;olved to accompany her Hu&s;band in &s;o honourable an Expedition, waited for the Time of their Departure with the utmo&s;t Im|patience.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret Grief which prey'd on the Heart of the <HI>Moor,</HI> beginning, as the Time of parting approached nearer, to &s;pread a Gloom on his Countenance, and give an Air of Re&s;traint to his Behaviour; <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> ex|tremely alarmed, entreated him to tell her the Cau&s;e of that Change &s;he ob&s;erved in him:
<PB N="103" REF="118">
"What is the Rea&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, that I &s;ee you melancholy and dejected at a Time when the Honours you have received from the Senate give you mo&s;t Rea&s;on to rejoice?"</P>
<P>"The Exce&s;s of my Love for you, replied the <HI>Moor,</HI> &s;ighing, prevents me from enjoying tho&s;e Honours as I ought; &s;ince they force me to the &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering one or other of two Things, both equally in&s;upportable; for either I mu&s;t expo&s;e you to the Dangers of the Sea, by taking you with me to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> or el&s;e leave you behind me at <HI>Venice:</HI> The fir&s;t can|not but be a mo&s;t heavy Misfortune to me, &s;ince every Fatigue you will &s;uffer, every Danger you are expo&s;ed to, will bring me the extreme&s;t Affliction; and as for the &s;econd, parting with you is more terrible than parting with my Life."</P>
<P>"Ah! my deare&s;t Hu&s;band, &s;aid <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> what Thoughts are the&s;e which you have &s;uf|fered to afflict you? Did you imagine I would con&s;ent to a Separation from you? How could you wrong my Love &s;o much? That Love, which, to be with you, would impel me to pa&s;s even through Flames; well may I then re&s;olve to accompany you to Sea, in a &s;ecure and well mann'd Ship: If there are Dangers and Fatigues to be endured, you &s;hall not en|dure them alone: I will &s;hare your Fortune whatever it be, and nothing but Death &s;hall di|vide me from you."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> in a Tran&s;port of grateful Tenderne&s;s, throwing his Arms round her Neck, and pre&s;&s;ing her to his Bo&s;om, cried out, "Heaven long pre&s;erve you, my mo&s;t dear,
<PB N="104" REF="119">
my lovely Wife, in the&s;e affectionate Senti|ments for me."</P>
<P>Some little Time after, the nece&s;&s;ary Pre|parations for their Voyage being ready, the <HI>Moor,</HI> with <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> and their Attendants, entered a Galley, and &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Cyprus</HI>; whi|ther, after, a plea&s;ant and ea&s;y Voyage, they arrived, together with all the Forces under the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Command.</P>
<P>Among the Officers in the&s;e Troops was a Lieutenant, very dear to the <HI>Moor:</HI> Nature had given him a mo&s;t beautiful and graceful Per&s;on, but a Mind replete with all Manner of Wickedne&s;s; however, he knew &s;o well how to conceal his vicious Inclinations under an ap|parent generous and noble Behaviour, that his Hypocri&s;y, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Speciou&s;ne&s;s of his Form, procured him the E&s;teem and Friend-of all his Companions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> who had conceived a particular Friend&s;hip for him, took great Plea&s;ure in his Conver&s;ation, and invited him frequently to his Hou&s;e, and <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> fond of every Oc|ca&s;ion of gratifying the Humour of her Hu&s;|band, treated him with equal Civility.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant had married a young Wo|man at <HI>Venice,</HI> whom he brought with him to <HI>Cyprus; Di&s;demona,</HI> fond of this Woman, becau&s;e &s;he was an <HI>Italian,</HI> and al&s;o an agree|able Companion, went often to her Hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed great Part of the Day with her.</P>
<P>The villainous Lieutenant having, by the&s;e Means, frequent Opportunities of &s;eeing <HI>Di&s;|demona,</HI> became violently enamoured of her; and neither re&s;trained by the Fidelity he owed
<PB N="105" REF="120">
his Wife, or the Re&s;pect and Gratitude due to his Friend and Commander, re&s;olved to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Endeavours to gratify his infamous Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Well knowing that Death would be the Con&s;equence of his pre&s;umptuous Attempt if it came to the Knowledge of the <HI>Moor,</HI> he dur&s;t not di&s;cover his Flame to <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> any other Way than by Sighs and pa&s;&s;ionate Glances, hoping in Time to in&s;pire her with De&s;ires like his own.</P>
<P>But the Lady, who&s;e Thoughts were wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Moor,</HI> took &s;o little Notice of tho&s;e &s;ilent Addre&s;&s;es, that her Indifference per&s;uading him &s;ome other Lover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her Heart, Rage, Jealou&s;y and De&s;pair produced the Effects of the mo&s;t violent Hatred, and he re&s;olved to be revenged both on her and the Lover &s;he favoured.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman, who was Captain of a Troop at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and greatly beloved by the <HI>Moor,</HI> was &s;u&s;pected by the Lieutenant to be the happy Rival who enjoyed the Affections of <HI>Di&s;demona</HI>; his Death therefore he deter|mined to procure; and by accu&s;ing the Lady to the <HI>Moor</HI> of Adultery, prevent any other from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her, &s;ince he could not.</P>
<P>His De&s;ign thus laid, he waited only for &s;ome favourable Opportunity to put it in Exe|cution; the <HI>Moor</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ionate Affection for his Wife, and the great Affection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the young Captain, making the Villain apprehend his Enterprize would be very hazardous and doubtful.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="121">Fortune however a&s;&s;i&s;ted his wicked Inten|tions, and when he lea&s;t expected it afforded him the Means of effecting them.</P>
<P>The Captain happening indi&s;creetly to draw his Sword upon a Soldier and wounding him, the <HI>Moor</HI> was &s;o much offended that he de|prived him of his Command.</P>
<P><HI>De&s;demona,</HI> who only regarded this young Gentleman becau&s;e he was beloved of her Hu&s;band, was greatly concerned that he had fallen under his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and often &s;olici|ted for his Pardon.</P>
<P>"I am &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid the <HI>Moor</HI> one Day to the Lieutenant, with my Wife's Entreaties in Favour of the Captain, that I believe I mu&s;t comply with her De&s;ire, and pardon him."</P>
<P>"She has Rea&s;on, &s;aid the Villain, &s;eizing this Occa&s;ion to execute his Scheme, that &s;he may &s;ee him as u&s;ual."</P>
<P>"What is it you &s;ay?" replied the <HI>Moor</HI> ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"Do not in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;peaking plainer, re&s;umed the Lieutenant: Far be it from me to &s;ow the Seeds of Di&s;cord between Man and Wife; yet methinks if you would open your Eyes, &s;ome Things would not e&s;cape your Ob&s;ervation."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> rouzed to Attention by the&s;e Words, and greatly di&s;turbed at the latent Meaning of them, earne&s;tly entreated the Lieutenant to explain him&s;elf more clearly; but the artful Villain ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and though the <HI>Moor</HI> u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours to per&s;uade him to give him the Satisfaction he de&s;ired, yet he per&s;i&s;ted in an ob&s;tinate De|nial:
<PB N="107" REF="122">
Neverthele&s;s, the Hints he had thrown out fixed a thou&s;and Stings in the Brea&s;t of the wretched Hu&s;band; he ruminated Night and Day on the Purport of tho&s;e fatal Words, and the more he reflected on them, the more his Di&s;quiet encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> ignorant of the Cau&s;e of his Melancholy, did not neglect to &s;olicit &s;till for the Captain;&mdash;"Why, &s;aid &s;he to him one Day, will you &s;uffer a &s;mall Fault to cancel the Friend&s;hip which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o many Years between the Captain and you? Mu&s;t all his Services and long-experienced Fidelity be wholly forgot for the Sake of one incon&s;ide|rate Action? The Soldier he wounded is no longer at Enmity with him; they are recon|ciled; and why &s;hould you continue inexo|rable?"</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s the Emotions with which his Heart had been long agitated, replied in a Rage.</P>
<P>"It is &s;trange, <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> it is very &s;trange, that you &s;hould be &s;o extremely concerned about this Man; if he was your Brother, or &s;ome other Relation, his Intere&s;ts could not be dearer to you."</P>
<P>The Lady an&s;wered in a &s;oft and humble Accent: "Heaven forbid, my Lord, that I &s;hould incur your Di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;oliciting for the Captain's Pardon, to which nothing has in|duced me but the Concern I am under to &s;ee you deprived of &s;o good a Friend; a Friend who&s;e Fidelity you have &s;o often prai&s;ed to me; the Fault he has committed is not great enough to merit your Hatred; but you <HI>Moors</HI> are by
<PB N="108" REF="123">
Nature &s;o furious, that every little Thing moves you to Anger, and a De&s;ire of Revenge."</P>
<P>"And that, an&s;wered the <HI>Moor</HI> (exce&s;&s;ively enraged at her Words) ome Per&s;ons, who little think of it, &s;hall prove; yes, they &s;hall &s;ee me take a &s;evere Vengeance for the Injuries I have &s;uffered; and then, and not till then, &s;hall I be &s;atisfied."</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> full of Fear and Wonder at the&s;e ungentle Words, and unaccu&s;tomed Rage of her Hu&s;band, trembling and pale, re|plied, "Although my only Inducement to plead for the Captain was the Con&s;ideration of your Ea&s;e and Satisfaction, yet &s;ince my Solicitations are di&s;plea&s;ing to you, I will ne|ver more &s;peak to you on this Subject."</P>
<P>To this humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive An&s;wer the <HI>Moor</HI> made no Reply; but comparing his Wife's earne&s;t Entreaties for the Captain with the Lieutenant's In&s;inuations, a thou&s;and black Su&s;picions ro&s;e in his Mind, tortured with Doubts of her Fidelity, and wi&s;hing, yet dreading, to be freed from his di&s;tracting Su&s;|pence.</P>
<P>He quitted her with a gloomy Silence, and &s;ending for the Lieutenant, renewed his En|treaties, that he would &s;peak more openly con|cerning his Wife and the Captain.</P>
<P>The Villain, who had re&s;olved to effect the Ruin of the&s;e two Innocents, after long re&s;i&s;t|ing the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Solicitations, as if unwilling to give him Pain, feigning at la&s;t to be overcome by his repeated Prayers, &s;aid, "I cannot deny, my Lord, but that my extreme Reluctance to give you Unea&s;ine&s;s has prevented me thus
<PB N="109" REF="124">
long from telling you what mu&s;t afflict you more than any other; but &s;ince you command me to &s;peak plain, the Regard I have for your Honour as my Friend, and the Duty I owe you as my General, will not permit me to di&s;obey you: Know then, that your black Colour is become di&s;ta&s;teful to your Wife; &s;he is pa&s;&s;ionately in love with the Captain, and her Impatience at finding her&s;elf deprived of the Plea&s;ure &s;he took in his Company, is the Cau&s;e of her continual Solicitations for his Pardon, that &s;he may conver&s;e with him as u&s;ual."</P>
<P>The&s;e Words gave mortal Agonies to the Soul of the wretched <HI>Moor</HI>; and though he was but too well convinced of the Truth of them, yet, di&s;&s;embling his Conviction in or|der to try him further, "I know not, &s;aid he, with a furious Countenance, why thou ha&s;t dared to load my Wife with the&s;e infamous A&s;per&s;ions?"</P>
<P>"This Rage, replied the Lieutenant, is the Reward I expected for my friendly Infor|mation; but &s;ince my Duty, and the De&s;ire of pre&s;erving your Honour, has carried me this Length, I will not now go back: What I have told you is but too certain; and if your Wife, with a counterfeited Tenderne&s;s, has &s;o blinded your Eyes, that you will not &s;ee your Di&s;honour, there is no Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not declare the Truth to you: The Captain him&s;elf has owned to me the Favours he has received from her; not &s;atisfied with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her in Secret, he mu&s;t have a Con|fident in his Happine&s;s; but had I not been
<PB N="110" REF="125">
afraid of your Re&s;entment, I would that Mo|ment have rewarded his pre&s;umptuous Confe&s;|&s;ion with the Death he merited."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> racked with unutterable Pangs, cried out, "Give me the Means of &s;eeing with my own Eyes the Truth of what you have &s;aid, or el&s;e be &s;ure I will make thee wi&s;h thou had&s;t been dumb."</P>
<P>"It would have been ea&s;y to do this, re|plied the Villain, while the Captain and you continued in Friend&s;hip, and he had free Ac|ce&s;s to <HI>Di&s;demona</HI>; but now that you have puni&s;hed him for a &s;light Fault, in&s;tead of taking Vengeance for an irreparable Injury, it will be difficult to &s;atisfy you; but though I am per&s;uaded that he enjoys <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> whenever you give him an Opportunity, yet, it is cer|tain, &s;ince he is in Di&s;grace with you, he is obliged to act more cautiou&s;ly than before, when, through your Friend&s;hip for him, he came to your Hou&s;e every Day; however, added he, taking Leave of him, I do not de&s;|pair of being able &s;oon to give you an Oppor|tunity of &s;eeing what you will not believe without it."</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Moor</HI> then returned to his Hou&s;e, carrying a poi&s;oned Arrow in his Brea&s;t, and impatiently waited for the Day in which the Lieutenant was to prove the Truth of what he had told him, and confirm him in eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Nor was the Villain him&s;elf wholly at ea&s;e, when reflecting on the known Cha&s;tity of <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> he was &s;en&s;ible he could not give
<PB N="111" REF="126">
the <HI>Moor</HI> &s;uch a convincing Proof of her Di&s;|loyalty as he demanded.</P>
<P>After long deliberating with him&s;elf on the Methods by which he might be&s;t execute the horrid Scheme he had begun, he at la&s;t thought upon a Stratagem which &s;eemed to promi&s;e Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>De&s;demona,</HI> as has been already &s;aid, went often to vi&s;it the Lieutenant's Wife; the Vil|lain, when &s;he was one Day at his Hou&s;e, ob&s;erved a Handkerchief at her Girdle, finely wrought in <HI>More&s;co</HI> Work, which, becau&s;e it was pre&s;ented her by the <HI>Moor</HI> when he mar|ried her, &s;he had a particular Value for it; it being al&s;o highly prized by the <HI>Moor</HI> him&s;elf: This Handkerchief the Lieutenant determined to &s;teal, and with it accompli&s;h her ab&s;olute Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;demona</HI> being extremely fond of a little Child of his, about three Years of Age, he took her in his Arms and carried her to the Lady, who receiving her from him, ki&s;&s;ed her &s;everal Times, and pre&s;&s;ed her clo&s;e to her Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Villain, in the mean while, drew her Handkerchief gently from her Girdle, and concealing it in his Pocket, went away tran&s;|ported with Joy at his good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> wholly ignorant of her Lo&s;s, returned to her Hou&s;e, and did not mi&s;s her Handkerchief till &s;ome Time after, when hap|pening to have Occa&s;ion for it, and not being able, after diligent Search, to find it, &s;he con|cluded it lo&s;t; and remained extremely terri|fied
<PB N="112" REF="127">
le&s;t the <HI>Moor</HI> &s;hould a&s;k for it, as he often did.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant, who had all this while been watching for an Opportunity to di&s;po&s;e of it where it might produce the Mi&s;chief he had projected, found Means at la&s;t to leave it on the Captain's Bed, whom he vi&s;ited one Morning before he was up for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Captain ri&s;ing &s;oon after he went away, the Handkerchief fell upon the Floor, and he finding &s;omething under his Feet, &s;tooped to take it up, and &s;eeing the Handkerchief, knew it to be <HI>Di&s;demona</HI>'s, but was not able to ima|gine how it came there; re&s;olving however to return it to her, he put it in his Pocket, and going out, was informed that the <HI>Moor</HI> was not at home; taking this Opportunity therefore to deliver it, he went to a back Door, and knocked &s;oftly; Fortune, as it &s;hould &s;eem, con&s;piring with the cruel Lieutenant to ruin the innocent <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> brought the <HI>Moor</HI> back ju&s;t in that Moment, who, hearing &s;ome|body knock in that cautious Manner, full of tormenting Di&s;tru&s;t, he ran to a Window, and opening it, enquired in a &s;urly Accent, who was there?</P>
<P>The Captain, hearing the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Voice, and fearing that he intended to do him a Mi&s;|chief, ran away without &s;peaking a Word.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor</HI> ran eagerly down Stairs, and ru&s;hed into the Street to &s;eek him, but he was already out of Sight; then returning full of Rage and Grief, he went to his Wife's Apart|ment, and a&s;ked her if &s;he knew who it was that had knocked below?</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="128">The Lady replied, "that &s;he could not tell who it was;" which indeed was true.</P>
<P>"I think, &s;aid the <HI>Moor,</HI> it &s;eemed to be the Captain."</P>
<P>"I know not, replied <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> whether it was him or any other."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he did not an&s;wer him truly, with Difficulty re&s;trained his Rage from breaking into Reproaches and Menaces; but re&s;olving to act nothing again&s;t her till he had con&s;ulted his wicked Confidant; and to prevent her di&s;covering his Di&s;order, left her &s;uddenly, and went to the Lieutenant, to whom he related what had happened, en|treating him to go to the Captain and endea|vour to make &s;ome more Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>The Villain, &s;ecretly exulting at this Acci|dent, promi&s;ed him to do as he required; and placing the <HI>Moor,</HI> where un&s;een him&s;elf, he might &s;ee them together, though not hear their Di&s;cour&s;e, he artfully contrived to bring the Captain near the Place, and began to talk with him on indifferent Things, u&s;ing at the &s;ame Time &s;uch Ge&s;tures with his Head and Hands, as per&s;uaded the <HI>Moor</HI> they were talk|ing about <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> and making a Je&s;t of his Di&s;honour and her Incontinence.</P>
<P>When they parted, the <HI>Moor</HI> eagerly quitted his Concealment, and came to the Lieutenant to know what they had been &s;aying.</P>
<P>The &s;ubtle Villain, &s;uffering him&s;elf to be long entreated before he would di&s;cover what he had heard, at length confe&s;&s;ed, that the Captain told him, "he had often enjoyed <HI>Di&s;|demona,</HI> when, by his being abroad, they had
<PB N="114" REF="129">
an Opportunity to meet; and added, that the Captain had told him al&s;o, that the la&s;t Time he was with <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> &s;he gave him that Handkerchief which he had pre&s;ented her the Day of their Marriage."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor</HI> thanked the Lieutenant for this Intelligence, and told him, "that he would a&s;k <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> for that Handkerchief, and if &s;he could not produce it, he &s;hould be con|vinced all that he had told him concerning her Infidelity was true."</P>
<P>Accordingly, one Day after Dinner, di&s;|cour&s;ing freely with <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> on indifferent Things, he took Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the Handkerchief, and a&s;ked to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The Lady, who had long dreaded this De|mand, blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, and thinking to conceal her Confu&s;ion, which was well ob|&s;erved by the <HI>Moor,</HI> ro&s;e and pretended to &s;eek for it; and after &s;he had employed her&s;elf in this Manner &s;ome time, "I cannot find it, &s;aid &s;he (returning to her Hu&s;band) perhaps you have it your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Is it probable, replied he, that I would de&s;ire you to give it me if I had it in my Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; however, look for it no more at pre|&s;ent; you will find it perhaps &s;ome other Time."</P>
<P>Then leaving the Room, he began to con|&s;ider in what Manner he &s;hould murder his Wife and the Captain without bringing on him&s;elf the Su&s;picion of being the Author of their Deaths.</P>
<P>The&s;e gloomy Thoughts employing him Night and Day, <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> who perceived
<PB N="115" REF="130">
his Behaviour to her much altered, often en|deavoured to di&s;cover the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"What ails you, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he to him many Times? Why do I behold you always di&s;turbed and unea&s;y? You who u&s;ed to be the gaye&s;t Man in the World, are now become the mo&s;t peevi&s;h and melancholy."</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> continuing to di&s;&s;emble his Re|&s;entment, returned her eva&s;ive An&s;wers, with which &s;he was but ill &s;atisfied; con&s;cious &s;he had given him no Cau&s;e for treating her un|kindly, &s;he concluded Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had abated his Flame, and Di&s;gu&s;t had &s;ucceeded to his once violent Pa&s;&s;ion for her; full of the&s;e me|lancholy Apprehen&s;ions, &s;he went to the Lieu|tenant's Hou&s;e, in order to unburthen her Heart to his Wife, with whom &s;he lived in great Familiarity.</P>
<P>"Alas! &s;aid &s;he, weeping, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw her, I know not what to think of my Lord; he, who was once all Love and Ten|derne&s;s towards me, is become &s;o altered with|in the&s;e few Days, that I am per&s;uaded he no longer loves me; and I fear I &s;hall prove a &s;ad Example to all young Ladies who pre&s;ume to marry again&s;t the Con&s;ents of their Parents; and a Warning to the <HI>Italian</HI> Women never to join them&s;elves to Men, between whom and them Nature and Heaven have placed &s;uch wide Di&s;tinctions.&mdash;I know, added &s;he, &s;igh|ing, that my Lord is fond of your Hu&s;band, and communicates to him all his Affairs; if through him then you are acquainted with the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Moor</HI>'s unaccu&s;tomed Cold|ne&s;s
<PB N="116" REF="131">
to me, I entreat you to let me know it, and do not refu&s;e me your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in this Di|&s;tre&s;s?"</P>
<P>The Lieutenant's Wife was indeed well ac|quainted with the whole Affair; her Hu&s;band having often pre&s;&s;ed her to join with him in his cruel Schemes again&s;t the innocent <HI>Di&s;de|mona</HI>; but though &s;he never would con&s;ent to the being acce&s;&s;ary to her Ruin, yet, dreading her Hu&s;band's Re&s;entment if &s;he betrayed his Secret, &s;he only replied, "I advi&s;e you, Madam, to beware of giving the General any Su&s;picions of your Fidelity, and let it be your continual Study to per&s;uade him of your Truth and Affection."</P>
<P>"All this I do, replied the weeping <HI>Di&s;|demona,</HI> but all is in vain."</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Moor,</HI> re&s;tle&s;s, unre|&s;olved, and &s;eeking Occa&s;ion to be convinced of what he wi&s;hed not to know, entreated the Lieutenant to contrive it &s;o, that he might &s;ee <HI>Di&s;demona</HI>'s Handkerchief in the Captain's Hands.</P>
<P>This, although the Villain thought very dif|ficult, yet he promi&s;ed to perform, and watched all Opportunities of keeping his Word.</P>
<P>The Captain had a Woman in the Hou&s;e who was very &s;kilful in Works of Embroi|dery; &s;he having &s;een <HI>Di&s;demona</HI>'s Handker|chief, and under&s;tanding that it was to be re|turned to her, re&s;olved to work one like it.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant being informed of this, and one Day knowing that Woman was &s;eated at a Window working, with the fatal Hand|kerchief before her for a Pattern, he carried the
<PB N="117" REF="132">
<HI>Moor</HI> through the Street, who perceiving his Wife's Handkerchief in that Woman's Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, had no longer any Doubt of her Infi|delity, and took a firm Re&s;olution to murder her and the no le&s;s injured Captain.</P>
<P>Conferring therefore with the Lieutenant upon the Means of executing his horrid Pur|po&s;e, he earne&s;tly entreated him to undertake to murder the Captain, a&s;&s;uring him that he would never forget the Obligation.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant excu&s;ing him&s;elf from complying, as well for the Wickedne&s;s of the Deed, as for the great Danger in attempting it, the Captain being a very brave and coura|gious Man; the <HI>Moor</HI> added to his Entreaties the Pre&s;ent of a large Sum of Money, which at la&s;t fixed him in a Re&s;olution to obey him.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant had not waited long for an Opportunity of executing his impious De&s;ign, before Fortune pre&s;ented him with a very fa|vourable one.</P>
<P>The Captain coming late one Night out of the Hou&s;e of a Courtezan, whom he kept, the Lieutenant, who was watching for him, ru&s;hed &s;uddenly, and with one Stroke of a Scymetar cut off his Leg.</P>
<P>The unhappy Captain fell to the Ground, and the Lieutenant upon him, who &s;ought to fini&s;h the Murder; wounded as he was, however, he drew his Sword, and endeavoured to defend him&s;elf, crying out aloud for Help.</P>
<P>Some Soldiers who were quartered near the Place, came running to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that the Lieutenant, fearing to be di&s;covered, left him and ran away; yet he did not go far, but
<PB N="118" REF="133">
taking a little Compa&s;s, joined &s;ome other Per&s;ons, who, drawn by the Captain's Cries, were ha&s;tening to him, and mixing among the Crowd who were about him, he &s;aw that his Leg was cut off, and did not doubt but he would die of the Wound; neverthele&s;s, con|cealing his inward Joy at his Succe&s;s, under an Appearance of great Concern for the Cap|tain's Misfortune, he lamented it as if it had happened to his Brother.</P>
<P>In the Morning the News of this Accident was &s;pread all over the City, and coming to the Knowledge of <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> &s;he, who was naturally tender and compa&s;&s;ionate, expre&s;&s;ed great Sorrow for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moor,</HI> di&s;tracted with Rage at this Confirmation (as he thought it) of her Af|fection for the Captain, went ha&s;tily to his wicked Confidant:&mdash;"Do&s;t thou know, &s;aid he, trembling with Fury, that my Wife is in &s;uch Grief for the Captain's Misfortune, that &s;he is almo&s;t di&s;tracted?"</P>
<P>"How can it be otherwi&s;e, replied the Lieu|tenant, when he is her Soul."</P>
<P>"Her Soul, repeated the furious <HI>Moor,</HI> Ah I will tear her Soul from her Body!&mdash;I &s;hould be unworthy the Name of a Man if I &s;uffered &s;uch a Wretch to live."</P>
<P>Then con&s;ulting together how they &s;hould di&s;patch her, whether by Poi&s;on, or a Dag|ger, the Lieutenant pau&s;ing, &s;aid, "I have thought of a Method by which you may kill her, without giving Su&s;picion to any one that you had any Hand in her Death, and this it is: The Hou&s;e in which you live is very old,
<PB N="119" REF="134">
and the Cieling of your Chamber has many Cracks in it; 'tis my Advice that we &s;hould beat <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> with a Bag of Sand till &s;he dies, that no Mark of Violence may appear on her Body; when &s;he is dead we will throw down Part of a rotten Beam from the Cieling, and having broke her Scull, pretend &s;he was killed by the Fall of the Beam as &s;he lay in Bed.</P>
<P>This cruel Contrivance plea&s;ed the <HI>Moor</HI> extremely, and having agreed to execute it the following Night, he found Means &s;e|cretly to convey the Lieutenant into a Clo&s;et within the Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> retired at her u&s;ual Hour to Bed, and the <HI>Moor</HI> with her; they had not lain long before the Lieutenant mak|ing &s;ome little ru&s;tling in the Clo&s;et, the <HI>Moor</HI> a&s;ked his Wife if &s;he heard any Noi&s;e?</P>
<P>She an&s;wering in the affirmative, ri&s;e then, &s;aid the <HI>Moor,</HI> and &s;ee what it is?</P>
<P>The Lady got up immediately, and the Lieu|tenant that Moment ru&s;hing out of the Clo&s;et, gave her a furious Blow with a Bag of Sand on her Back; the wretched <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> fell on the Floor almo&s;t breathle&s;s, yet faintly calling her Hu&s;|band to help her, he throwing him&s;elf out of the Bed, replied, infamous Woman, thou now receive&s;t the Reward of thy Uncha&s;tity, thus ought all Adultere&s;&s;es to be treated, who deluding their Hu&s;bands with a feigned Affec|tion, load them with Shame and Grief.</P>
<P>The wretched Lady hearing the&s;e Words, and feeling her&s;elf near her End, by another Blow which the cruel Lieutenant had given
<PB N="120" REF="135">
her, &s;ighed out with a broken and interrupted Voice&mdash;Since Ju&s;tice has been denied me in this World, Oh, let the Divine Ju&s;tice bear Witne&s;s to my Innocence, and receive my Soul to Mercy.</P>
<P>The remor&s;ele&s;s Villain, unmoved with this pathetic Exclamation, &s;triking her a third Time with all his Force, &s;he expired immediately.</P>
<P>When they were convinced &s;he was dead, the Lieutenant took her off the Floor, and cra&s;hing her Scull laid her in the Bed, then with the <HI>Moor</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tance, broke down Part of a Beam, and placed it &s;o as to give it an Ap|pearance of having fallen upon her Head.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant then went cautiou&s;ly out of the Hou&s;e; and the <HI>Moor</HI> with loud Cries, began to call for Help, &s;aying the Hou&s;e was tum|bling down; the Servants and Neighbours ran in to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;ome of them ap|proaching the Bed, found <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> within it dead, and, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, murdered by the Fall of the Beam.</P>
<P>This piteous Spectacle drew Tears and Complaints from all who beheld it, and the next Day the Corp&s;e of the injured Lady was buried, amid&s;t the univer&s;al Grief of all the Inhabitants of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to whom her Virtues had rendered her extremely dear.</P>
<P>The Manner of her Death not being &s;u&s;pect|ed by any one, the villainous Perpetrators of it thought them&s;elves ab&s;olutely &s;ecure, but the Almighty Ju&s;tice would not long permit &s;uch a Crime to remain unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="136">The <HI>Moor,</HI> who had loved the unhappy Lady with the utmo&s;t Exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion, find|ing him&s;elf deprived of her for ever, and not able to endure the Lo&s;s, his whole Soul was filled with the mo&s;t torturing Angui&s;h, and in the Frenzy of his Grief, he would &s;earch for her in every Apartment of the Hou&s;e, and call ince&s;&s;antly on her Name; then reflecting, that by the Lieutenant's Accu&s;ations he had lo&s;t this beloved Wife for ever, and with her all the Comfort and Happine&s;s of his Life, he conceived &s;o violent a Hatred of him, that he could not endure to have him in his Sight, and had he not feared the inviolable Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate, he would have put him to Death; but not being able to do this, without hazarding his own Life, that he might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure gratify his Revenge, he deprived him of his Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant enraged as this Treat|ment, re&s;olved to effect his Ruin; and for that Purpo&s;e went to the Captain, who was now recovered, but with the Lo&s;s of his Leg, having been obliged to have a wooden one in its &s;tead "The Time is now come, &s;aid the diabolical Villain, in which you may take Vengeance on the Man who was the Occa&s;i|on of the Lo&s;s of your Leg; if you will go with me to <HI>Venice,</HI> I will there di&s;cover him to you and the Senate, and prove the Truth of what I now &s;ay; but here, for many Rea|&s;ons, I dare not &s;peak plainer."</P>
<P>The Captain, who wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to be revenged on this &s;ecret Enemy, thanked the Lieutenant for his Information,
<PB N="122" REF="137">
and a few Days after they both embarked for <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>When they arrived, the Lieutenant told him that it was the <HI>Moor</HI> who had cut off his Leg, through an Opinion that he had di&s;|honoured his Wife, and that for the &s;ame Cau&s;e he had al&s;o murdered her, and made it be reported that &s;he was killed by the Fall of a Beam.</P>
<P>The Captain hereupon accu&s;ed the <HI>Moor</HI> to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate, of having deprived him of his Leg, and murdering his Lady, producing the Lieutenant for a Witne&s;s to both the&s;e Facts.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant then related the Manner in which it had been executed, adding, that the <HI>Moor</HI> had communicated this whole Scheme to him, and offered him great Rewards to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in it, which becau&s;e of the Wickedne&s;s of the Deeds, he had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Senate, enraged at the Cruelty which had been practi&s;ed by a Barbarian upon two of their Citizens, &s;ent Orders to have the <HI>Moor</HI> arre&s;ted at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and brought with a &s;trong Guard to <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after his Arrival he was publicly tried, but per&s;i&s;ting in a Denial of the Crimes with which he was accu&s;ed, he was put to the Tor|ture, but &s;uch was his extream Ob&s;tinacy and Contempt of Pain, that all the different Torments which were inflicted on him, were not able to force a Confe&s;&s;ion from his Lips.</P>
<P>He was therefore &s;ent back to Pri&s;on, and &s;ome Time after bani&s;hed from <HI>Venice</HI> for ever, but though he had e&s;caped Death by the
<PB N="123" REF="138">
Law, yet the Relations of <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> procured him to be murdered in the Place to which he had retired.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant returned to his own Coun|try, and continuing &s;till in his wicked Practi|ces, he accu&s;ed one of his Companions of having offered him a Reward to kill his Ene|my; the Gentleman was &s;eized and racked, but he denied the Fact &s;o re&s;olutely, and &s;poke &s;o much again&s;t his wicked Accu&s;er, that he al&s;o was put to the &s;ame Torture, &s;o that being mi&s;erably mangled, he died as they were taking him down from the Rack, to carry him to his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant's Wife, after her Hu&s;band's Death, returning to <HI>Venice,</HI> related all the foregoing Particulars to the Senate. And thus by the e&s;pecial Providence of God was the Death of the innocent <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> revenged.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the U&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of <HI>Othello,</HI> or the <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Venice.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>OTHELLO,</HI> or the <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> the Plot of which is drawn from the foregoing Novel of <HI>Giraldi Cinthio,</HI> has always been e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Tra|gedies.</P>
<P>'Tis confe&s;&s;ed the Fable is more regular, the Incidents le&s;s numerous and clo&s;er connect|ed, and the Subject more of a Piece than any other of his Plays, except <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet.</HI></P>
<P>The Fable <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> found already form|ed to his Hands, &s;ome few Alterations he has made in it, and generally for the better.</P>
<P>Thus it &s;tands in the Poet.</P>
<P><HI>Othello,</HI> a <HI>Moor</HI> de&s;cended of Royal Blood, eminent for his great Valour, and the Services he had done the <HI>Venetians</HI> in their Wars, is preferred by the Senate to the Government of the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> which was threatned with an Inva&s;ion by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Othello,</HI> being commanded to go immediate|ly to his Government, takes with him, at her earne&s;t Reque&s;t, his Bride <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> a young Lady of great Beauty, Daughter to a Senator
<PB N="126" REF="140">
of <HI>Venice,</HI> who had married him unknown to her Father.</P>
<P><HI>Iago,</HI> Ancient to <HI>Othello,</HI> being jealous that the Moor had had an Intrigue with his Wife, and de&s;irous of procuring the Po&s;t of Lieutenant for him&s;elf, which was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> a young Officer very dear to the Moor, to gratify his Revenge and Ambition at once, he entertains a De&s;ign of making <HI>Othello</HI> jealous of <HI>De&s;demona</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> &s;o to bring a|bout her Death, and the Removal of <HI>Ca&s;&s;io.</HI></P>
<P>To effect this, by various Arts he rai&s;es Su&s;picions in the Mind of <HI>Othello,</HI> and to con|firm them prevails on his Wife, who attend|ed <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> to &s;teal a Handerchief which the Moor had given her.</P>
<P>This Handkerchief he drops in <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI>'s Apartment, and <HI>Othello</HI> accidentally &s;eeing it in his Hand, is convinced of his Wife's In|fidelity, orders <HI>Iago</HI> to kill his Rival, promi&s;ing to make him his Lieutenant in his &s;tead, and him&s;elf &s;mothers <HI>De&s;demona</HI> in her Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> e&s;capes only with a &s;light Wound.</P>
<P><HI>Emilia,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Iago,</HI> finding her Mi&s;|tre&s;s murdered, and hearing <HI>Othello</HI> declare he had killed her through her Hu&s;band's In|formations that &s;he had wronged him with <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> in who&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he had &s;een the Handkerchief he had given her; &s;he con|fe&s;&s;es &s;he had &s;tolen the Handkerchief at her Hu&s;band's Reque&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Iago,</HI> finding him&s;elf di&s;covered, &s;tabs his Wife, and in Part confe&s;&s;es his Villany.</P>
<P><HI>Othello,</HI> in De&s;pair, falls upon his Sword and dies, and the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Iago</HI> is left to
<PB N="127" REF="141">
<HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> who before <HI>Othello</HI>'s Death was or|dered by the Senate to take upon him the Go|vernment of <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Cinthio</HI> the Moor is mentioned without any Mark of <HI>Di&s;tinction; Shake&s;pear</HI> makes him de&s;cended from a Race of Kings, his Per&s;on is therefore made more con&s;iderable in the Play than in the Novel, and the Dignity which the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate be&s;tows upon him is le&s;s to be wondered at.</P>
<P>In the Play, <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> the Per&s;on of whom <HI>Othello</HI> is jealous, is repre&s;ented to be a young amiable Officer, remarkable for the Agreeable|ne&s;s of his Per&s;on, and the Sweetne&s;s of his Manners, and therefore likely enough to in|&s;pire <HI>De&s;demona</HI> with a Pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P>In the Novel, the&s;e Qualities are all a&s;crib|ed to the Villain who betrays the Moor to the Murder of his Wife; and the &s;u&s;pected Rival is no more than an ordinary Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Cinthio</HI> might perhaps think it nece&s;&s;ary to give his Villain a plea&s;ing Per&s;on and in&s;inuat|ing Addre&s;s, in order to make his Artifices le&s;s &s;u&s;pected; but to give Probability to the Jea|lou&s;y of the Moor, was it not al&s;o as nece&s;|&s;ary to make the &s;u&s;pected Rival po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of tho&s;e Qualities with which the Minds of young Ladies are &s;oone&s;t captivated.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> therefore paints <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> young, hand&s;ome, and brave; and <HI>Othello,</HI> who feeds his Jealou&s;y, by reflecting that he him&s;elf is neither young nor hand&s;ome, by the &s;ame Train of Thought falls naturally into a Su&s;|picion, that what he lo&s;es, for want of tho&s;e
<PB N="128" REF="142">
Qualities, will be gained by another who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es them.</P>
<P>But on the other Hand <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made a very ill U&s;e of the Lieutenant's Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Cinthio</HI> &s;hews this Woman privy, much a|again&s;t her Will, to the De&s;ign on <HI>Di&s;|demona</HI>; and though &s;he dares not di&s;cover it to her, for fear of her Hu&s;band's Re&s;entment, yet &s;he endeavours to put her upon her Guard, and gives her &s;uch Advice, as &s;he thinks will render all his Schemes ineffectual.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> calls this Woman <HI>Emilia,</HI> and makes her the Attendant and Friend of <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> yet &s;hews her &s;tealing a Hand|kerchief from her, which &s;he gives to her Hu&s;band, telling him at the &s;ame Time that the Lady will run mad when &s;he mi&s;&s;es it; therefore, if it is not for &s;ome Purpo&s;e of Im|portance that he wants it, de&s;ires him to re|turn it to her again.</P>
<P>If her Hu&s;band wants it for any Purpo&s;e of Importance, that Purpo&s;e cannot be very good; this Su&s;picion however never enters her Mind, but &s;he gives it him only upon that very Condition, which ought to have made her refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Yet this Woman is the fir&s;t who perceives <HI>Othello</HI> to be jealous, and repeats this Ob&s;er|vation to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, upon hearing him &s;o often demand the Handkerchief &s;he had &s;tolen, and fly into a Rage when he finds his Wife cannot produce it.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> in his Critici&s;ims on this Play, &s;everely cen&s;ures the Characters as well as the Fable, and Conduct of the Incidents.</P>
<P>That of <HI>Emilia</HI> though more incon&s;i&s;tent than any, he has taken no Notice of; and mo&s;t of the Charges he brings again&s;t the others have little or no Foundation.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Iago,</HI> &s;ays this Critic, is again&s;t common Sen&s;e and Nature. <Q><HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> would pa&s;s upon us a clo&s;e, di&s;&s;em|bling, fal&s;e, in&s;inuating Ra&s;cal, in&s;tead of an open-hearted, frank plain dealing Sol|dier; a Character con&s;tantly worn by them for &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years in the World.</Q></P>
<P>The Soldiers are indeed greatly obliged to Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> for this A&s;&s;ertion, but though it may in general be true, yet &s;urely it is not ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome few Individuals among&s;t them may be clo&s;e di&s;&s;embling Villains.</P>
<P><HI>Iago</HI> was a Soldier, it is true, but he was al&s;o an <HI>Italian</HI>; he was born in a Country remark|able for the deep Art, Cruelty, and revengeful Temper of its Inhabitants. To have painted an <HI>Italian</HI> injured, or under a Su&s;picion of be|ing injured, and not to have &s;hewn him re|vengeful,
<PB N="130" REF="144">
would have been mi&s;taking his Cha|racter.</P>
<P>It is with Ju&s;tice indeed that Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> condemns <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> for that unnece&s;&s;ary and diabolical Cruelty he makes <HI>Iago</HI> guilty of in urging <HI>Othello</HI> to the Murder of the innocent Lady who had never offended him; his Point was gained by making <HI>Othello</HI> jealous, and procuring his Con&s;ent to the Death of <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> who &s;tood in his Way to Preferment: But the Murder of <HI>De&s;demona</HI> was &s;uch an Exce&s;s of wanton Cruelty, that one can hardly con|ceive it po&s;&s;ible a Man could be &s;o tran&s;cend|ently wicked.</P>
<P><HI>Cinthio</HI> indeed makes <HI>Iago</HI> not only urge <HI>Othello</HI> to the Murder of his Wife, but is him|&s;elf the Perpetrator of it; this &s;eems &s;till more ab&s;urd; but he tells us, that he had been vio|lently in love with <HI>Di&s;demona,</HI> and the Indif|ference &s;he had di&s;covered towards him con|verted his Love into a &s;ettled Hatred.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> injudiciou&s;ly copies <HI>Cinthio</HI> in making <HI>Iago</HI> confe&s;s a Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> as it rendered his urging on her Murder le&s;s probable; &s;ince in the Play <HI>Iago</HI> had no Op|portunity of declaring that Love to her, and con&s;equently could not be &s;timulated by her Contempt of him to act &s;o cruel a Part again&s;t her.</P>
<P>But he has greatly improved on the Novel|i&s;t by making him jealous of the Moor with his own Wife; this Circum&s;tance being &s;uf|ficient, in an <HI>Italian</HI> e&s;pecially, to account for the Revenge he takes on <HI>Othello,</HI> though his Barbarity to <HI>De&s;demona</HI> is &s;till unnatural.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="145">Upon the whole, there is very little Difference between the Character of the Lieutenant as it is drawn in the Novel, and <HI>Iago</HI> as managed in the Play; his ambiguous Que&s;tions, dark Hints, and villainous Arts to rai&s;e Su&s;picions in the Mind of <HI>Othello</HI> are the &s;ame in the No|vel as in the Play; and the Scene where <HI>Othello</HI> is made to ob&s;erve the Ge&s;tures of <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> while he is talking to <HI>Iago,</HI> is exactly copied from <HI>Cinthio</HI>; as is likewi&s;e a preceding one, where <HI>Othello,</HI> tormented with Doubts about his Wife, threatens <HI>Iago</HI> with De&s;truction, unle&s;s he gives him ocular Proof of her Di&s;|hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>This Demand, with <HI>Iago</HI>'s Expo&s;tulations, Arguments, and &s;atisfactory Replies, are al&s;o the &s;ame with tho&s;e in the Novel.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>De&s;demona</HI> fares no bet|ter in Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Hands, than that of <HI>Iago</HI>; her Love for the Moor, he &s;ays, is out of Na|ture.</P>
<P>Such Affections are not very common in|deed; but a very few In&s;tances of them prove that they are not impo&s;&s;ible; and even in <HI>Eng|land</HI> we &s;ee &s;ome very hand&s;ome Women married to Blacks, where their Colour is le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s familiar than at <HI>Venice</HI>; be&s;ides the <HI>Italian</HI> La|dies are remarkable for &s;uch Sallies of irre|gular Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Cinthio,</HI> it is true, &s;ays, that <HI>Di&s;demona</HI> was not overcome by a womani&s;h Appetite, but repre&s;ents her, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> does likewi&s;e, &s;ubdued by the great Qualities of the Moor.</P>
<P>Courage in Men has always had an invin|cible Charm for the Ladies; <HI>De&s;demona</HI> ad|mired
<PB N="132" REF="146">
the Moor for his Valour, and the Tran|&s;ition from extreme Admiration to Love is very ea&s;y in a female Mind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> alledges, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes <HI>De&s;demona</HI> a Senator's Daughter in&s;tead of a &s;imple Citizen; and this he imputes to him as a Fault, which is perhaps a great In&s;tance of his Judgment.</P>
<P>There is le&s;s Improbability in &s;uppo&s;ing a noble Lady, educated in Sentiments &s;uperior to the Vulgar, &s;hould fall in love with a Man merely for the Qualities of his Mind, than that a mean Citizen &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch exalted Ideas, as to overlook the Di&s;parity of Years and Complexion, and be enamoured of Virtue in the Per&s;on of a Moor.</P>
<P>However, it is not true, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has changed a &s;imple Citizen into a Lady of Qua|lity, &s;ince <HI>De&s;demona</HI> in the Novel is men|tioned as a Woman of high Birth.</P>
<P><HI>Cinthio</HI> calls her <HI>Cittadina,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Ry|mer</HI> tran&s;lates a &s;imple Citizen; but the <HI>Ita|lians</HI> by that Phra&s;e mean a Woman of Quality.</P>
<P>If they were, for Example, to &s;peak of a Woman of the middle Rank in <HI>Rome,</HI> they would &s;ay, <HI>Una Romana</HI>; if of a noble Lady, <HI>Una Cittadina Romana</HI>: So in <HI>Venice</HI> they call a &s;imple Citizen <HI>Una Venitiana</HI>; but a Woman of Quality, <HI>Una Cittadina Veritiana.</HI></P>
<P>That Simplicity in the Manners of <HI>De&s;de|mona,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> calls Folly and Mean|ne&s;s of Spirit, is the Characteri&s;tic of Virtue and Innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="147"><HI>De&s;demona</HI> was con&s;cious of no Guilt, and therefore &s;u&s;pected no Blame: She had &s;o late|ly given the Moor an inconte&s;table Proof of her Affection, that it was not unnatural for her to impute his &s;udden Starts of Pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ome other Cau&s;e than Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The whole Stre&s;s of the Proof again&s;t <HI>De&s;|demona</HI> is laid upon the Handkerchief, as well in the Novel as the Play; though I think in the Novel it is more artfully managed; there the Moor in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;eeing it in the Captain's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion e'er he will re&s;olve any Thing again&s;t his Wife, and the Lieutenant contrives to give him this Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Othello,</HI> in the Play, has not the lea&s;t Ap|pearance of Proof again&s;t his Wife, but &s;ee|ing the Handkerchief in the Lieutenant's Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; yet this is brought about by mere Ac|cident.</P>
<P><HI>Bianca,</HI> to whom <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> had given it to have the Work copied, (which, by the way, was an odd Whim for a Soldier) comes to him while he is engaged in a private Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Iago</HI>; and <HI>Othello</HI> ob&s;erving them concealed, and in a Fit of Jealou&s;y, throws the Handker|chief at his Head.</P>
<P>This happens well for <HI>Iago</HI>'s Plot; but as he did not, and indeed could not fore&s;ee, this lucky Accident, methinks it would have been more natural, &s;ince every Thing depended upon that, to have made it the Effect of &s;ome Contrivance of his.</P>
<P>The Outlines <HI>Iago, De&s;demona,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI>'s Characters are taken from the Novel; but that of <HI>Othello</HI> is entirely the Poet's own.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="148">In <HI>Cinthio</HI> we have a Moor, valiant indeed, as we are told, but &s;u&s;picious, &s;ullen, cunning, ob&s;tinate and cruel.</P>
<P>Such a Character married to the fair <HI>De&s;de|mona</HI> mu&s;t have given Di&s;gu&s;t on the Stage; the Audience would have been his Enemies, and <HI>De&s;demona</HI> her&s;elf would have &s;unk into Contempt for chu&s;ing him.</P>
<P>With what Judgment then has <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> changed the horrid <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Cinthio</HI> into the amiable <HI>Othello,</HI> and made the &s;ame Actions which we dete&s;t in one, excite our Compa&s;|&s;ion in the other!</P>
<P>The Virtues of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Moor</HI> are no le&s;s characteri&s;tic than the Vices of <HI>Cinthio</HI>'s; they are the wild Growth of an uncultivated Mind, barbarous and rude as the Clime he is born in; thus, his Love is almo&s;t Phren&s;y; his Friend&s;hip Simplicity; his Ju&s;tice cruel; and his Remor&s;e Self-Murder.</P>

<HEAD>The ninth Novel of the &s;econd Day of the Decamerone of <HI>Boccaccio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SOME <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants meet|ing at <HI>Paris,</HI> whither their dif|ferent Affairs had brought them, they went, as was their Cu&s;tom, to &s;up together at a Tavern; and, towards the Clo&s;e of the Entertainment, their Spirits being rai&s;ed by the Wine, of which they drank pretty freely, they began, after having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;everal other Subjects, to &s;peak of their Wives, whom they had left behind them in their Hou&s;es; and one of them, laughing, &s;aid:</P>
<P>"I know not how my Wife employs her&s;elf in my Ab&s;ence, but this I am certain of; that when I am at a Di&s;tance from her, I freely in|dulge my&s;elf in the Pur&s;uit of any young Girl that plea&s;es me, and never fail to make my&s;elf Ma&s;ter of her Per&s;on, if I po&s;&s;ibly can."</P>
<P>Another replied, "that he did the &s;ame; becau&s;e, added he, whether I believe my Wife unfaithful, or not, &s;he will be &s;o if &s;he plea&s;es."</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="150">A Third a&s;&s;ured his Companions "that he was of the &s;ame Opinion;" and, in fine, they all agreed in declaring, "that they believed their Wives would not lo&s;e Time in their Ab&s;ence;" except a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Merchant, named <HI>Bernabo Lomillin.</HI></P>
<P>This young Man, who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of his Wife, affirmed, "that by the e&s;pecial Providence of God he had married a Woman &s;o accompli&s;hed in all Virtues, that <HI>Italy</HI> could &s;carce produce her Equal."</P>
<P>"Her Per&s;on, &s;aid he, is perfectly beauti|ful; &s;he is in the Prime of her Youth; and is not only &s;killed in all dome&s;tic Employments fit for a Per&s;on of her Rank, but &s;he reads, writes, and di&s;cour&s;es upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as if &s;he was a Merchant; &s;he is al&s;o wi&s;e, prudent and amiable; and &s;o ab&s;olutely cha&s;te, that I am per&s;uaded, if I was to be ab&s;ent from her ten Years, &s;he would pre&s;erve her Fidelity to me inviolable."</P>
<P>This la&s;t Prai&s;e extremely diverted a young Merchant of <HI>Piacenza,</HI> named <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> who, laughing, a&s;ked <HI>Bernabo</HI> "if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Privilege above other Men by a Patent from the Emperor.</P>
<P>"This Happine&s;s, replied <HI>Bernabo,</HI> a little offended, is not granted by the Emperor, but by God, whom I look upon to be little more powerful than the Emperor."</P>
<P>"I do not in the lea&s;t doubt, replied <HI>Ambro|giuolo,</HI> but that you believe what you &s;ay; but you have too little con&s;idered the Nature of
<PB N="137" REF="151">
Things, otherwi&s;e you would not be &s;o gro&s;sly deceived, but would &s;peak le&s;s a&s;&s;uredly upon this Matter; do you imagine that we, who have delivered our Sentiments thus freely of our Wives, believe we have married Women, who&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions are different from yours? no, we hold all Women to be alike; and the Judgment we have formed of them ari&s;es from our having well reflected on their Na|tures; let us then examine this Matter a lit|tle."</P>
<P>I have always under&s;tood Man to be the noble&s;t Animal of God's Creation; and that the Woman holds the next Place; if Man therefore, as he is generally believed, and proves by his Faculties, is the neare&s;t to Per|fection, he mu&s;t certainly be endowed with more Firmne&s;s and Con&s;tancy than the Wo|man, who is univer&s;ally allowed to be a fickle and variable Creature; yet &s;ince Man, with all his Firmne&s;s and Con&s;tancy cannot re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e De&s;ires which make him &s;eek the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of any one that plea&s;es him, how can&s;t thou hope that a Woman, changeable and un|fixed by Nature, &s;hould be able to re&s;i&s;t the Force of Intreaties, Prai&s;es, Gifts, and a Thou&s;and other Temptations, with which Men who know the Sex, endeavour to en&s;nare them?"</P>
<P>"Can you then, reflecting upon this Truth, believe your Wife faithful?"</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, though you &s;hould tell me you do, I could not believe you."</P>
<P>"Is not your Wife a Woman, has &s;he not Fle&s;h and Blood as other Women have?
<PB N="138" REF="152">
are not the &s;ame De&s;ires given to her as to others, and the &s;ame Ability to re&s;i&s;t them? 'tis therefore po&s;&s;ible, although &s;he be very virtuous, that &s;he may do as others do; and you ought not &s;o po&s;itively to affirm the con|trary."</P>
<P>To this long Speech <HI>Barnabo</HI> replied:</P>
<P>"I am a Merchant, and not a Philo&s;opher, therefore will not pretend to rea&s;on with you; but this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that tho&s;e Women who are uncha&s;te, are &s;o, becau&s;e they have no Sen&s;e of Shame, and are indifferent about the World's Opinion; but Women who are wi&s;e and virtuous, are &s;o &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve their Honour, that they become &s;tronger than Men, who take no Care to re&s;train their irre|gular Appetites; and my Wife is of the Num|ber of tho&s;e Women who are watchful over their Appetites, and &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve their Honour."</P>
<P>"Truly, replied <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> if every Time a Woman was unfaithful to her Hu&s;band, a Horn &s;hould grow out of her Forehead, and bear Witne&s;s to the Fact, I believe few Wo|men would be guilty of Infidelity; but the Horn neither grows, nor in Women who manage their Intrigues wi&s;ely, does there re|main the lea&s;t Trace of their Crime; for their Shame does not con&s;i&s;t in their Infidelity, but in that Infidelity being di&s;covered; there|fore when they can be uncha&s;te &s;ecurely, they are &s;o, and when they are not uncha&s;te, 'tis becau&s;e they are &s;tupid; and be a&s;&s;ured there|fore,
<PB N="139" REF="153">
that &s;he only is cha&s;te who was never &s;ollicited, or being &s;ollicited never yielded."</P>
<P>"And although I am convinced of this Truth, by con&s;idering in general the Frailty of Human Nature, yet I would not &s;peak &s;o po&s;itively as I do, if I had not many Times, and with many different Women, proved it beyond Contradiction; and I am al&s;o per&s;uad|ed, that if I was near thy &s;upremely virtuous Wife, I &s;hould in a very &s;hort Space of Time bring her to that, to which I have brought many others."</P>
<P>"It Signifies nothing di&s;puting, replied <HI>Barnabo,</HI> (greatly di&s;turbed) Words prove nothing at all; but &s;ince you &s;ay that no Wo|man is able to re&s;i&s;t Sollicitations, and are &s;o confident of your own Power with the Sex, that you are ab&s;olutely certain you can corrupt my Wife, I am willing to lo&s;e my Head if you &s;ucceed in your Attempts upon her Cha&s;tity, and if you do not, you &s;hall lo&s;e a Thou&s;and Florins of Gold to me."</P>
<P>"I know not, returned <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> al|ready fired at his Propo&s;ition, what I &s;hould do with your Head if you lo&s;t it to me, but if you are willing to have a Proof of what I have maintained, do you lay five Thou&s;and Florins of Gold (which ought to be le&s;s dear to you than your Head) again&s;t a Thou&s;and of mine, and I will oblige my&s;elf to go to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and in three Months from the Day I depart from hence, will prevail upon thy Wife to yield to my De&s;ires, and, in Token of my

<P>"But you mu&s;t promi&s;e me faithfully that you will not come to <HI>Genoa</HI> during my Stay there, nor write any Account of this Matter to your Wife."</P>
<P><HI>Bernabo</HI> was extremely plea&s;ed with this Propo&s;al, but the other Merchants, who were pre&s;ent, fearing &s;ome bad Con&s;equence would ari&s;e from &s;uch a &s;trange Scheme, were very much troubled, and endeavoured to prevent its being put into Execution.</P>
<P>However, the two Per&s;ons concerned were &s;o re&s;olutely bent on their Purpo&s;e, that all Di&s;&s;ua&s;ions were ineffectual; and an Obliga|tion in Writing being drawn up, they both &s;igned and &s;ealed it in the Pre&s;ence of their Companions; and a few Days after <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> went to <HI>Genoa; Bernabo,</HI> according to his Promi&s;e, &s;taying at <HI>Paris</HI> to expect his Re|turn.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> arrived at <HI>Genoa,</HI> he began &s;ecretly to enquire after the Behaviour and Manner of Life of <HI>Bernabo</HI>'s Wife, and comparing the Reports of others, with what <HI>Bernabo</HI> had told him concerning her, he found the Merchant had not been too lavi&s;h in her Prai&s;es; and his Enterprize now ap|pearing even to him&s;elf ra&s;h and impractica|ble, he was beginning to lo&s;e all Hopes of being able to accompli&s;h it, when Chance

threw in his Way a poor Woman, who was often employed in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Madonna Zinevra,</HI> &s;o was the Wife of <HI>Bernabo</HI> called.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> corrupting this Woman with a Sum of Money, engaged her to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his De&s;ign on the Lady.</P>
<P>Giving Orders therefore for a Che&s;t to be made after a particular Manner, he laid him|&s;elf into it, and the old Woman pretending &s;he had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act a few Miles out of the Town, which would oblige her to &s;tay a Day or two away, intreated <HI>Madonna Zinevra,</HI> who had a great Kindne&s;s for her, to let this Che&s;t &s;tand in her Bed-Chamber till &s;he returned, the Lady con&s;ented, and the Che&s;t, with <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> within it, was placed where &s;he de&s;ired.</P>
<P><HI>Zinevra</HI> retiring to Re&s;t at her u&s;ual Hour, <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> when he was a&s;&s;ured that &s;he was a&s;leep, came &s;oftly out of the Che&s;t into the Chamber, and, by the Light of a Taper which was burning, took particular Notice of the Pictures and Furniture of the Room.</P>
<P>Then advancing to the Bed, where the Lady and a little Girl that was with her &s;lept very &s;oundly, he gently uncovered her, and &s;aw that &s;he was no le&s;s beautiful naked than dre&s;t, and as he was thus contemplating her, and wi&s;hing to di&s;cover &s;ome particular Mark about her Per&s;on, which might help him to deceive her Hu&s;band, he at la&s;t &s;pied a large Mole under her left Brea&s;t, with &s;everal Hairs round it of the Colour of Gold.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="156">Satisfied with this Di&s;covery, he replaced the Cloaths, but her Beauty inflaming his De|&s;ires, he was &s;ome Moments in Su&s;pence whether he &s;hould not wake her, and declare the Cau&s;e of his coming thither, to be his Love of her.</P>
<P>Reflecting however upon the Severity of her Virtue; he re&s;olved not to hazard his Life by di&s;covering him&s;elf, but pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the Night at his Ea&s;e in the Chamber.</P>
<P>Day approaching he retired into the Che&s;t, taking with him a Pur&s;e, a Ring, and &s;ome other Trifles.</P>
<P>In this Confinement he pa&s;&s;ed another Night, and the Day following the Woman coming for her Che&s;t, he was relea&s;ed; and hav|ing thus traiterou&s;ly accompli&s;hed his Intenti|ons, he left <HI>Genoa,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> before the Time prefixed for his Return.</P>

he might by &s;ome Stratagem have procured the Knowledge of the one, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other, and therefore if he had no other Proofs, the&s;e were in&s;ufficient to make him give up the Wager.</P>

and carry a Letter from him to his Wife, im|porting his De&s;ires, that &s;he &s;hould return with the Bearer to him; and then gave a &s;trict Com|mand to the Servant to murder her as &s;oon as they came into a convenient Place.</P>
<P>The Servant a&s;&s;ured him of his Obedience, and rode immediately to Town with the Let|ter; which <HI>Zinevra</HI> receiving with great Joy, prepared her&s;elf for her Journey the next Morning; and accompanied only by the Per|&s;on who came to fetch her, &s;he took the Road to her Hu&s;band's Villa, di&s;cour&s;ing as they went upon indifferent Things: when coming into a large and &s;olitary Valley, &s;ur|rounded with high Trees, the Servant, think|ing this a fit Place to execute his Ma&s;ter's Or|ders, &s;uddenly &s;topt, and drawing out a large Knife &s;eized the Lady by the Arm.</P>
<P>"Madam, &s;aid he, recommend your Soul to God, for you mu&s;t die in a few Moments."</P>
<P>The Lady hearing the&s;e dreadful Words, and beholding the fatal Knife, all trembling with Fear and Surprize, cried out,</P>
<P>"Oh! Mercy gracious Heaven! why will you murder me? Tell me in what I have of|fended you, that you re&s;olve to kill me?"</P>
<P>"Madam, replied the Servant, you have not offended me in any Thing, how you have offended your Hu&s;band I know not, but he has commanded me to murder you without
<PB N="145" REF="159">
Mercy in this Place, and if I do not obey him, threatens to hang me.</P>
<P>"You know by what Tyes I am bound to him, and that I have it not in my Power to re|fu&s;e Compliance with any of his Orders; God knows I pity you; but I mu&s;t execute his Will."</P>
<P>"Oh grant me Mercy, for the Sake of Hea|ven! replied the Lady, all di&s;&s;olved in Tears; do not become a Murderer of one who never injured you to plea&s;e another.</P>
<P>"God, from whom nothing is concealed, knows I never was guilty of any Action for which I merit this U&s;age from my Hu&s;band; but of that no more.</P>
<P>"Suffer me only to repre&s;ent to you how you may at once avoid offending God, plea&s;e your Ma&s;ter, and &s;erve me, and that in this Manner:</P>
<P>"You may give me your upper Coat and Hat, and take my Cloaths, and returning with them to your Ma&s;ter, tell him you have mur|dered me; and I &s;wear to you by that Pre&s;er|vation for which I &s;hall be obliged to you, that I will keep my&s;elf concealed, and wander into &s;ome di&s;tant Place, and neither you or he &s;hall ever hear of me again in this Country."</P>
<P>The Servant, who was very unwilling to murder her, ea&s;ily yielded to his Compa&s;&s;ion and her Entreaties, and gave her his Coat and Hat, together with what Money he found a|bout her; and after earne&s;tly de&s;iring her to quit <HI>Genoa</HI> as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, took her Cloaths, and leaving her alone and on foot in the Val|ley,
<PB N="146" REF="160">
returned to his Ma&s;ter, to whom he de|clared, "that he had murdered her, and that her dead Body was devoured by the Wolves."</P>
<P>The unhappy Lady being alone and di&s;con|&s;olate in the dreary Valley which had been de&s;tined for the Scene of her Murder, knew not whither to direct her Steps; but Night drawing on, and her Apprehen&s;ions of that dreadful Place encrea&s;ing with the approaching Darkne&s;s, &s;he &s;truck into a foot Path, which led at la&s;t to a little Village; and there going into the Cottage of an old Woman, procured &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries fit for her Appearance as a Sailor, and thus clad, took her Way towards the Shore.</P>
<P>There happening to meet with a <HI>Catalonian</HI> Gentleman, who&s;e Ship lying near the Place, had landed to refre&s;h him&s;elf at a Fountain; he entering into Di&s;cour&s;e with the poor Wan|derer, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be a Man, at her Re|que&s;t, received her as a Servant to wait upon his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Madonna Zinevra,</HI> who had taken the Name of <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> followed Signor <HI>Encarach,</HI> her new Ma&s;ter, to his Ve&s;&s;el; and, having better Cloaths given her, began to &s;erve him &s;o dili|gently, and with &s;uch Fidelity, that he &s;oon conceived a great E&s;teem for her.</P>
<P>Some time after, the <HI>Catalonian</HI> &s;ailing with a Cargo to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> he took with him &s;ome very fine Falcons, which he pre&s;ented to the
<PB N="147" REF="161">
Sultan, who being plea&s;ed with the Gift, fre|quently invited the Merchant to his Table.</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> always attending his Ma&s;ter upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, the Sultan was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his Carriage and Behaviour, that he a&s;ked him of the <HI>Catalonian</HI>; who, though very un|willing to part with him, could not refu&s;e the Sultan's Reque&s;t, and therefore left him be|hind at <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> had not been long in the Sultan's Palace, before he acquired as great a Share of that Monarch's Confidence and E&s;teem, as of the <HI>Catalonian</HI>'s, his former Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It being a Cu&s;tom, at a certain Time of the Year, to hold a Fair at <HI>Aeri,</HI> a City in the Dominions of the Sultan, to which a great ma|ny Chri&s;tians and <HI>Saracen</HI> Merchants re&s;ort|ed, the Sultan, in who&s;e Favour <HI>Sicuranno</HI> encrea&s;ed daily, appointed him to command the Soldiers that were &s;ent there, to guard the Merchants and their Goods while the Fair continued.</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> being now Captain of the Guard at <HI>Aeri,</HI> acquitted him&s;elf of this Charge with his accu&s;tomed Diligence and Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Among the foreign Merchants which re|&s;orted to this Fair, there were &s;everal <HI>Venetian, Placentian, Genoe&s;e,</HI> and other <HI>Italians,</HI> with whom <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> who &s;till had a great Fond|ne&s;s for his Country, frequently conver&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="162">If happened one Day, when he was at the Warehou&s;e of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Merchants, that, among other Trinkets, he &s;aw a Pur&s;e and a Girdle, which he knew to have once belonged to him&s;elf; he was greatly &s;urprized at the Sight of tho&s;e Things, but concealing it from Ob&s;ervation, enquired who&s;e they were? and if they were to be &s;old?</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> who had come to <HI>Alexandria</HI> with &s;ome other Merchants in a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, being told that the Captain of the Guard was enquiring about the&s;e Things, came forward, and &s;aid, with a Smile "Sir, the Things are mine, and not to be &s;old; but if you have any Inclination for them, I will pre&s;ent you with them freely."</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> &s;eeing him &s;mile, &s;u&s;pected, that by &s;ome Means or other, he had di&s;covered who he was; neverthele&s;s, keeping a firm Countenance, he replied;</P>
<P>"You &s;mile, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e you &s;ee me, who am a military Man, enquiring about the&s;e female Trifles."</P>
<P>"No, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Ambroguiolo,</HI> I do not &s;mile at that, but at reflecting on the Manner in which I gained tho&s;e Things."</P>
<P>"Ah! I be&s;eech you, &s;aid <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> ha&s;tily, let us know how you gained them then?"</P>
<P>"Sir, replied <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> the&s;e Things were given me by a Lady of <HI>Genoa,</HI> called <HI>Ma|donna Zinevra,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Bernabo Lomillin,</HI> with whom I had the Honour to pa&s;s a Night,
<PB N="149" REF="163">
in her Hu&s;band's Ab&s;ence; and &s;he enteated me to keep them faithfully for her Sake: I &s;mile, therefore, at reflecting on the &s;tupid Fol|ly of her Hu&s;band, who was &s;illy enough to lay five thou&s;and Florins of Gold again&s;t a thou&s;and of mine, that it was not in my Power to prevail over the Cha&s;tity of his Wife; this, however, I accompli&s;hed; he lo&s;t the Wager; and he who ought rather to have puni&s;hed him&s;elf for his Stupidity, than his Wife for doing that which all Women will do, went to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and, as I have &s;ince heard, cau&s;ed her to be mur|dered."</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> hearing this, knew this Man im|mediately to be the Cau&s;e of all his Mi&s;ery, and re&s;olved within him&s;elf to be &s;everely re|venged on him; and in order to acompli&s;h his De&s;ign, he feigned him&s;elf to be extremely well plea&s;ed with this Story, and began to en|ter into a &s;trict Intimacy with <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> whom he managed &s;o artfully, that at la&s;t he confe&s;&s;ed the whole Truth to him concerning the Stratagem by which he had deceived <HI>Ber|nabo,</HI> and gained the Wager.</P>
<P>When the Fair was ended, <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> by large Promi&s;es, engaged <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> to go with him into <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where he procured him a Warehou&s;e, and lodged Money in his Hands; &s;o that <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> thinking he might be able to encrea&s;e his Fortune there, willing|ly &s;tayed at <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno,</HI> who ardently de&s;ired to have his Innocence made known to <HI>Bernabo,</HI> practi&s;ed
<PB N="150" REF="164">
&s;o well with &s;ome <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Merchants who were in that Country, that they prevailed up|on <HI>Bernabo,</HI> who was now reduced to very low Circum&s;tances, to come to <HI>Alexandria</HI>; and <HI>Sicuranno</HI> cau&s;ed him to be privately re|ceived there by &s;ome of his Friends.</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno,</HI> who had already made <HI>Ambro|giuolo</HI> recount to the Sultan the Story he had fir&s;t told him, and which had plea&s;ed him great|ly, finding it now a proper Time to execute his Intention, &s;ince <HI>Bernabo</HI> was arrived, took an Opportunity to entreat the Sultan to give Orders, that <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> and <HI>Bernabo</HI> &s;hould be brought before him; and to make <HI>Ambro|giuolo,</HI> by Menaces (if he would not by gentle Methods) declare, if what he had boa&s;ted con|cerning the Wife of <HI>Bernabo</HI> was true.</P>
<P>The Sultan con&s;ented; and the two Mer|chants being brought before him, he command|ed <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> with a threatening Counte|nance, to confe&s;s truly, how he had won the five thou&s;and Florins of <HI>Bernabo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> &s;eeing his Friend <HI>Sicuranno</HI> (who was pre&s;ent) look upon him with rageful Eyes, and threatening him with the mo&s;t horrid Tor|ments if he did not reveal the Truth; pre&s;&s;ed on every Side, and &s;uppo&s;ing the wor&s;t Con&s;e|quence of his Confe&s;&s;ion would be the Re&s;titu|tion of the Money and the Things, he re|lated the whole Affair ju&s;t as it happened; and having fini&s;hed his Narration, <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> as inve&s;ted with Authority by the Sultan, turned to <HI>Bernabo,</HI> and a&s;ked him "what
<PB N="151" REF="165">
Puni&s;hment he had inflicted upon his Wife on Account of that Lye?"</P>
<P>"Sir, replied <HI>Bernabo,</HI> being inflamed with Rage for the Lo&s;s of my Money, and the Di&s;|grace my Wife's Infamy had brought upon me, I ordered a Servant to murder her, and, ac|cording to his Report, he did &s;o, and her Body was &s;oon after devoured by Wolves."</P>
<P>The&s;e Facts thus laid open before the Sultan, and all that were pre&s;ent, who could not ima|gine what was to be the End of &s;uch an Exami|dation, <HI>Sicuranno,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Sultan, &s;aid:</P>
<P>"My Lord, you may plainly perceive by their Confe&s;&s;ions, what Rea&s;on this good Wo|man had to glory in a Lover and a Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>"The Lover by an infamous Fal&s;hood robs her of her Honour, de&s;troys her Fame, and deprives her of her Hu&s;band; and the Hu&s;band giving more Credit to the Fal&s;hoods of others than to the often experienced Truth of his Wife, commands her to be murdered, and her dead Body to be devoured by Wolves; and &s;o great is the Affection which this Lover and Hu&s;band bore her, that they both continued with her a long Time, and neither of them di&s;|covered her.</P>
<P>"That you may be able therefore to know this clearly, and give to each the Reward they have merited, grant me the Favour I am going to implore of you, which is to pardon the De|ceived and puni&s;h the Deceiver, and I will then make the injured Lady her&s;elf come into your Pre&s;ence?"</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="166">The Sultan, always di&s;po&s;ed to comply with any Reque&s;t of <HI>Sicuranno</HI>'s, granted this im|mediately, and de&s;ired him to make the Lady come.</P>
<P><HI>Bernabo,</HI> who firmly believed his Wife to be dead, was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at this Propo|&s;ition; and <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> began now to appre|hend he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;omething wor&s;e than paying back the Money.</P>
<P><HI>Sicuranno</HI> being thus a&s;&s;ured of having her Reque&s;t granted by the Sultan, ca&s;t her&s;elf at the Feet of that Monarch; the Tears fa&s;t &s;treaming down her Cheeks, and lo&s;ing with her a&s;&s;umed ma&s;culine Voice, the De&s;ire of appearing ma&s;culine, &s;poke in this Manner.</P>
<P>"My Lord, in me behold the injured, the unhappy <HI>Zinevra,</HI> who, through the wicked Fal&s;hoods of that Traitor <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> have been obliged to wander mi&s;erably through the World in the Form of a Man, and by this cruel Hu&s;band doomed to be murdered and de|voured by Wolves.</P>
<P>Then opening her Wai&s;tcoat, &s;he di&s;covered her Bo&s;om, by which the Sultan, and all who were pre&s;ent, knowing her to be a Woman, were filled with A&s;toni&s;hment and Compa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Zinevra</HI> then turning to <HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> fierce|ly demanded of him. "when it was he had &s;educed her Virtue, as he had once openly boa&s;ted?"</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogiuolo,</HI> who now knew her, and was &s;truck dumb with Shame and Fear, an&s;wered nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="167">The Sultan, who always believed her to be a Man, was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at what he now &s;aw and heard, that, for &s;ome Moments, he knew not whether all was not a Dream; but his Wonder cea&s;ing, he began to prai&s;e, with the highe&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of E&s;teem, the Virtue, Con&s;tancy, and unblameable Manners of <HI>Zi|nevra,</HI> and gave Orders to have her magnifi|cently dre&s;t in a female Habit, appointed Wo|men to attend her, and, as he had promi&s;ed, pardoned the deceived Hu&s;band <HI>Bernabo,</HI> who falling at the Feet of his Wife, entreated her al&s;o with Tears to forgive him.</P>
<P><HI>Zinevra</HI> rai&s;ed him up, and kindly a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he would forget all that was pa&s;t, threw her&s;elf into his Arms, and as her Hu&s;|band embraced him tenderly.</P>
<P>The Sultan then commanded <HI>Ambrogiuolo</HI> to be carried immediately to one of the highe&s;t Places in the City, and fa&s;tened to a Stake, his Body to be anointed with Honey, and expo&s;ed naked to the Sun, and there left to die; which was accordingly executed; after which he ordered all his Effects to be given to <HI>Zinevra,</HI> which amounted to ten thou&s;and Pi&s;toles; and make|ing a magnificent Fea&s;t, he publicly be&s;towed the highe&s;t Honours and Applau&s;es on <HI>Zinevra</HI> for her Courage and Virtue, and pre&s;ented her Hu&s;band and her with ten thou&s;and Pi&s;toles more, giving them Leave to depart, and a Ship to carry them back to <HI>Genoa</HI>; where they &s;oon after arrived, extremely rich, and were received with great Honours by their Citizens;

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the U&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of <HI>Cymbeline.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Plot of the foregoing Novel forms one of the Actions of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Tragedy, called <HI>Cymbeline</HI>; I &s;ay one of the Actions, becau&s;e this Play, with his u&s;ual Ir|regularity, is compo&s;ed of three or four dif|ferent ones.</P>
<P>He has copied all tho&s;e Circum&s;tances from <HI>Boccacio,</HI> that were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;erve his De|&s;ign; but he has entirely changed the Scene, the Characters, and the Manners; and that he has done &s;o greatly for the wor&s;e, is I think ea&s;y to prove.</P>
<P><HI>Boccaccio</HI> introduces &s;ome young Merchants in a Tavern, where two of them, being heated by Wine, lay a fanta&s;tical Wager; one that his Wife was ab&s;olutely cha&s;te, and not to be corrupted by any Methods whatever.</P>
<P>The other, that &s;he was frail like the re&s;t of the Sex; and that to prove it, he would prevail upon her in a very &s;hort Time to violate her Faith to her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="170"><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes the Lady in Que&s;tion, not the Wife of a Merchant, but the Heire&s;s of a great Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Hu&s;band, who lays &s;o indi&s;creet a Wager, not a &s;imple Trader intoxicated with Liquor, but a young, noble, though unfor|tunate Hero, whom, for the extraordinary Qua|lities of his Mind and Per&s;on, the Prince&s;s had &s;ecretly married.</P>
<P>And the Scenes, in&s;tead of a Tavern in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Hou&s;e of a private Family in the Court of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Chamber of the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>To this injudicious Change of the Charac|ters is owing all the Ab&s;urdities of this Part of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plot; he has given the Man|ners of a Trade&s;man's Wife, and two Mer|chants intoxicated with Liquor, to a great Prince&s;s, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hero, and a noble Roman.</P>
<P>The King, enraged at <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> for dar|ing to marry his Daughter, contents him&s;elf with only &s;ending him into Bani&s;hment, and pre&s;&s;es the Prince&s;s to take for another Hu&s;|band a Man whom &s;he dete&s;ts, while her fir&s;t is only divided from her by a very incon|&s;iderable Di&s;tance, and while there is a Proba|bility of meeting him again.</P>
<P>Since he was &s;o re&s;olutely bent upon mak|ing her marry the &s;tupid Son of his &s;econd Wife, &s;urely it would have more facilitated his De&s;ign, to have either taken away the Life of <HI>Po&s;thumus,</HI> or kept him in a &s;trict and &s;ecret Confinement, and by that Means
<PB N="157" REF="171">
have deprived the Prince&s;s of all Hope of ever &s;eeing him; but <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> mu&s;t only be ba|ni&s;hed to make Way for the &s;candalous Wager.</P>
<P>This adoring and obliged Hu&s;band of a beautiful and virtuous Prince&s;s, no &s;ooner ar|rives at <HI>Rome,</HI> but he engages in a ridiculous Di&s;pute concerning the Beauty, Wit, and Cha&s;tity of his Lady; and tamely &s;uffers one of his <HI>Roman</HI> Friends, to maintain that &s;he was as liable to be corrupted as any other of her Sex.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute growing warm, the <HI>Roman</HI> engages to take a Journey to <HI>Britain,</HI> and corrupt the Cha&s;tity of the Prince&s;s, which, if he accompli&s;hes, <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> is to reward him with the Ring that &s;he had given him at parting; and to facilitate his De&s;ign, writes a Letter to the Prince&s;s, recommending <HI>Jachimo</HI> to her as one of his mo&s;t valued Friends.</P>
<P><HI>Jachimo</HI> accordingly arrives in <HI>Britain,</HI> de|livers his Letter to the Prince&s;s, and is very kindly received.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the Prince&s;s is &s;trictly guarded by the King's Orders, and this is very natural, &s;ince he intended to force her to marry her &s;tupid Step-brother.</P>
<P>But how comes it that this confined Prince&s;s, guarded by her Father's Guards, and watched by her Mother-in-law's Spies, &s;hould be able to give an Audience to a foreign Stranger, who comes from the very Place where her ba|ni&s;hed Hu&s;band re&s;ides?</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="172">We &s;ee no Stratagem made u&s;e of to elude the Vigilance of her Guards; no Bribes given to buy the Secre&s;y of Spies.</P>
<P>The Friend of her bani&s;hed Hu&s;band is introduced by his Confident, who though known to be &s;o, both by the King, Queen, and Rival of <HI>Po&s;thumus,</HI> is &s;till permitted to attend her.</P>
<P>This is not indeed very probable, but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Plot, becau&s;e this faithful Confident is to carry the Prince&s;s af|terwards into a dark Wood, in order to kill her, by his Ma&s;ter's Orders.</P>
<P>So the Story goes in <HI>Boccaccio,</HI> &s;o al&s;o goes the Plot in the Tragedy.</P>
<P>There is only this &s;mall Difference, that in <HI>Boccacio</HI> it is a private Gentlewoman, who, attended with one Servant, rides a &s;mall Jour|ney to meet her Hu&s;band at his Country Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> it is the Heire&s;s of a great Kingdom, who notwith&s;tanding her Guards, the Dignity of her Station, and Weakne&s;s of her Sex, rides Po&s;t with one Man Servant to a Sea-port Town, for a &s;hort. View of her Hu&s;band. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee how <HI>Jachimo</HI> begins his Court|&s;hip to this great Prince&s;s: After having in&s;i|nuated into her Bo&s;om &s;ome jealous Su&s;pici|ons of her Hu&s;band's Con&s;tancy, he goes on to prai&s;e her Beauty familiarly enough, con&s;i|dering he had but a few Minutes Acquaint|ance with her Highne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="173">Then begs Leave to "dedicate him&s;elf to her &s;weet Plea&s;ure," and &s;uppo&s;ing the Bar|gain concluded, offers to ki&s;s her.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s calls <HI>Pi&s;anio,</HI> her Hu&s;band's Confident; he happens not to be within hear|ing; and this is very convenient, for there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for a long Conver&s;ation to make all right again, for the &s;econd Part of <HI>Jachimo</HI>'s Stratagem.</P>
<P>Her Highne&s;s then turns to her impudent Gallant, tells him, "if he had been honour|able he would not have &s;ought &s;uch a ba&s;e End of her," and that &s;he "di&s;dains him and the Devil alike."</P>
<P>The Gallant upon this Lucretia-like De|nial, changes his Note, prai&s;es the Virtue and Con&s;tancy of her Hu&s;band, and a&s;&s;ures her, he only made this Attempt on her Cha&s;tity, in order to try if &s;he was really as pure as &s;he was believed to be.</P>
<P>Her Highne&s;s is pacified, profe&s;&s;es her&s;elf his faithful Friend, and offers him all her In|tere&s;t in the Court.</P>
<P><HI>Jachimo</HI> waves this princely Offer; but de|&s;ires her to allow him to put a Che&s;t of Goods under her Care for one Night, to which the Prince&s;s con&s;enting, a&s;&s;ures him his Che&s;t &s;hall be placed in her own Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>Upon this Expedient the whole Plot turns.</P>

<P>The Wife of <HI>Bernabo</HI> the Merchant might indeed find it nece&s;&s;ary to keep her&s;elf un&s;u&s;pected by her Hu&s;band, &s;ince her Hap|pine&s;s depended upon his believing her vir|tuous.</P>
<P>But the Prince&s;s's Con&s;tancy to <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> was the Cau&s;e of her Di&s;grace; by marrying <HI>Cloten</HI> &s;he might regain her Liberty, and con|&s;equently have better Opportunities of follow|ing her private Intrigues.</P>
<P>But what Inducement could &s;he have for incurring the Re&s;entment of the King her Father, only to &s;eem con&s;tant to a bani&s;hed Man, whom &s;he was di&s;honouring in pri|vate?</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="175">Her Con&s;tancy to <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> in Defiance of her Father's Anger, could only be the Effect of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion for him; but her aban|doning her&s;elf to a loo&s;e Intrigue with his Friend, was ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with her Love for him.</P>

<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> no doubt fore&s;aw his Readers would a&s;k this Que&s;tion if the Prince&s;s did not, but though he found it an ea&s;y Matter to make <HI>Pi&s;anio</HI> &s;atisfy her as to that Particular, the Reader is not &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wered.</P>
<P>For why indeed did he bring her into &s;o &s;hocking a Situation, if he re&s;olved not to murder her? Why did he not acquaint her with the cruel Orders of her Hu&s;band while &s;he was in her Father's Palace?</P>
<P>If it was a bold and hazardous Action to quit the Court in &s;uch a &s;trange Equipage, to have a &s;hort Conference with a faithful Hu&s;|band, why mu&s;t &s;he expo&s;e her&s;elf to &s;o emi|nent a Danger, only to be told of the Cruelty and Inju&s;tice of that Husband?</P>

<P><PB N="164" REF="178">To bring all this about, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> makes her drink a Potion, re&s;embling that of <HI>Juliet</HI>'s in its Effects; this Potion is tempered by the Queen's Phy&s;ician, whom &s;he had de&s;ired to prepare her a Poi&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Pi&s;anio</HI> being in the Queen's Apartment when the Drug was brought in, looked ear|ne&s;tly at it, which the Queen ob&s;erving, de&s;ir|ed him to accept of it, telling him it was a fine Cordial.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;ician, who is by, whi&s;pers <HI>Pi&s;anio,</HI> that the Queen having de&s;ired him to prepare her &s;ome mortal Poi&s;on, he had given her a Drug, which would only make the Per&s;on that drank of it fall into a Sleep, re&s;embling Death.</P>
<P>One would think <HI>Pi&s;anio</HI> was &s;ufficiently warned, yet we find him giving this Drug to the Prince&s;s when he left her in the Wood, a&s;|&s;uring her it was a rich Cordial given him by the Queen, and intreating her to drink &s;ome of it when &s;he was &s;ick.</P>
<P>This Blunder however produces a great many other Events; <HI>Imogen</HI> thought to be dead, is buried by the young Fore&s;ters (who are her Brothers, though unknown) in the Wood.</P>
<P><HI>Cloten</HI> follows the Prince&s;s with an Intention, as he declares, "to ravi&s;h her, and then kick her back to Court," and is di&s;gui&s;ed in the Cloaths of <HI>Po&s;thumus,</HI> though there is no other Rea&s;on for his being thus di&s;gui&s;ed, but only that the Prince&s;s may afterwards &s;uppo&s;e him <HI>Po&s;thumus</HI> when &s;he finds him dead. Being af|terwards killed by the Brothers of <HI>Imogen,</HI> one of them cuts off his Head, and buries him be&s;ide the &s;uppo&s;ed Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="179">It may &s;eem a little &s;hocking for a generous young Man, a Prince, though he did not know a&s; him&s;elf, to cut off the Head of his Enemy, it ter having killed him; but his Head mu&s;t be cut off, or el&s;e how could <HI>Imogen</HI> mi&s;take him for her Lord?</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s awaking from her Trance, &s;uppo&s;es &s;he is travelling to <HI>Milford-Haven,</HI> and cries, "Ods pittikens, is it &s;ix Miles yet?" recovering her Sen&s;es perfectly, and &s;eeing a headle&s;s Man lying near, dre&s;t in the Cloaths of <HI>Po&s;thumus,</HI> &s;he laments over him, believing him to be her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>This is indeed a very pathetic Di&s;tre&s;s; but what does the unhappy Heire&s;s of <HI>Britain</HI> do, now &s;he thinks her Hu&s;band is killed? Why &s;he accepts the Po&s;t of Page to the Enemy of her Father and Country; who, with a ho&s;tile Army, is wa&s;ting the Kingdom, over which, by Right of Birth, &s;he is to reign.</P>
<P>But why does the Prince&s;s di&s;grace her Sex and Dignity by accepting &s;o &s;candalous an Employment? Is it the Fear of Death from the <HI>Romans?</HI> No, certainly there is no &s;uch Thing threatened.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, a Lady, fond to Di&s;traction of a Hu&s;band whom &s;he finds lying murdered by her, can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o attentive to her own Danger in tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful Moments as to provide &s;o cunnningly for her Safety.</P>
<P>However, the Prince&s;s, full of De&s;pair as &s;he is, dre&s;&s;es up a clever Tale in a Trice; invents a Name for her murdered Hu&s;band; calls her&s;elf his Page; &s;ays he was &s;lain by

<P>_A Nobleman of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> named <HI>E&s;nard,</HI> Count of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> being of a weak and &s;ickly Con&s;titution, always kept a Phy&s;ician, named <HI>Ge|rard de Narbonne,</HI> in his Hou&s;e. This Count had one only Son, called <HI>Ber|trand</HI>; he was extremely hand&s;ome and of a &s;weet and gentle Di&s;po&s;ition; the Count cau&s;ed &s;everal young Boys of his Age to be educated with him; among whom there was al&s;o a little Girl, named <HI>Giletta,</HI> Daughter to the Phy|&s;ician.</P>
<P>This Girl loved <HI>Bertrand</HI> with a Tender|ne&s;s and Ardor very uncommon to one of her Age.</P>
<P>The Count dying, left his Son under the Guardian&s;hip of the King; and his Maje&s;ty &s;ending Orders for him to come to <HI>Paris, Gi|letta,</HI> who&s;e Affection encrea&s;ed with her
<PB N="170" REF="183">
Years, remained in the utmo&s;t Affliction at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P>The Phy&s;ician dying &s;oon after the young Count's Departure, <HI>Giletta</HI> would have &s;et out for <HI>Paris</HI> to &s;ee her beloved <HI>Bertrand</HI>; but being a great Fortune, her Conduct was care|fully watched; and not being able to find a rea&s;onable Excu&s;e for &s;uch a Journey, &s;he was obliged for the pre&s;ent to quit her De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Growing now of Years fit to be married, her Relations propo&s;ed &s;everal Matches to her, which &s;he, without explaining the true Cau&s;e, refu&s;ed, the &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had long felt for <HI>Bertrand</HI> gaining Strength by the Reports &s;he had continually heard of his extraordinary Beauty and Accompli&s;hments, &s;he re&s;olved never to give her Hand to any other Man.</P>
<P>But while &s;he was langui&s;hing with a hope|le&s;s De&s;ire of &s;eeing the Count, News came that the King of <HI>France</HI> was extremely ill; a Swelling in his Stomach having been badly treated, had turned to a Fi&s;tula; and the An|gui&s;h he felt from his Di&s;temper was encrea&s;ed by his De&s;pair of ever getting it cured; no Phy&s;ician being found that was able to remove it, notwith&s;tanding great Numbers had been tried, who had all left it wor&s;e than before.</P>
<P>The King, therefore, in the utmo&s;t De&s;|pair at their bad Succe&s;s, would no longer ad|mit of Advice or A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Giletta,</HI> overjoyed at this News, thought &s;he had now not only a good Excu&s;e for go|ing to <HI>Paris,</HI> but if the King's Di&s;temper was
<PB N="171" REF="184">
what &s;he believed it to be, there was al&s;o a Po&s;&s;ibility of gaining <HI>Bertrand</HI> for a Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Her Father having di&s;covered to her many valuable Secrets of his Art, &s;he made a Pow|der of a certain Herb, which &s;he had been taught by him was a Remedy for the Di&s;|ea&s;e &s;he imagined the King was afflicted with; and privately getting a Hor&s;e prepared for her, went immediately to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Her fir&s;t Care after her Arrival was to gain a Sight of her dear <HI>Bertrand</HI>; and then pro|curing an Audience of the King, &s;he earne&s;t|ly entreated him to let her look at the Swel|ling.</P>
<P>The King &s;eeing her &s;o young and hand|&s;ome, could not refu&s;e her Reque&s;t; as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, &s;he immediately entertained Hopes of curing him, and &s;aid, "Sire, if you are willing, I tru&s;t in God I &s;hall be able, without giving you much Pain or Fatigue, to cure you of this Di&s;temper in eight Days."</P>
<P>The King laughing at the&s;e &s;olemn A&s;|&s;urances, replied, "Since the greate&s;t Phy|&s;icians in the World have not been able to cure me, how is it po&s;&s;ible a young Woman &s;hould perform what was too difficult for them; I give you thanks for your good Will, but I am determined never more to follow any Pre|&s;cription whatever."</P>
<P>"Sire, replied <HI>Giletta,</HI> you de&s;pi&s;e my Art becau&s;e I am young, and a Woman; I am not indeed a Phy&s;ician; nor is it by my own Know|ledge that I pretend to cure you; but by the Help of God, and the Knowledge of <HI>Gerard

de Narbonne,</HI> who was my Father, and when he was alive, a celebrated Phy&s;ician."</P>
<P>The King, being moved with the&s;e Words, began to rea&s;on with him&s;elf in this Manner:</P>
<P>"This Woman, perhaps, is &s;ent by Provi|dence for my Relief; ought I not, at lea&s;t, to try what &s;he can do? e&s;pecially &s;ince &s;he &s;ays &s;he will cure me in a little Time, and that too without much Pain:" Then having taken his Re&s;olution, he &s;aid, "But, Dam&s;el, if after having made me break through my Re&s;olves, you do dot cure me, what Puni&s;hment are you willing to &s;ubmit to?"</P>
<P>"Sire, an&s;wered <HI>Giletta,</HI> make me be care|fully guarded, and, if after the Expiration of eight Days, I do not cure you, &s;entence me to be burnt; but if I do cure you, what &s;hall be my Recompence?"</P>
<P>"You &s;eem to me, &s;aid the King to be &s;till unmarried; if you perform what you have pro|mi&s;ed, I will give you a rich and honourable Hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"Truly, Sire, &s;aid <HI>Giletta,</HI> I am very well plea&s;ed with your De&s;ign of marrying me; but I mu&s;t be at Liberty to name my Hu&s;band, and no Per&s;on whatever, except tho&s;e of the Royal Blood, mu&s;t be refu&s;ed me."</P>
<P>The King agreed to her Reque&s;t imme|diately, and promi&s;ed her it &s;hould be punctu|ally complied with.</P>
<P><HI>Giletta,</HI> thereupon, began to admini&s;ter her Medicine, which &s;he pur&s;ued &s;o happily, that before the Time prefixed, &s;he re&s;tored him to Health.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="186">The King feeling him&s;elf perfectly cured, &s;aid to her, "Dam&s;el, you have well gained your Hu&s;band." "Then, Sire, &s;he replied, I have gained <HI>Bertrand,</HI> Count of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> whom I began to love in my Infancy, and have ever &s;ince loved with the mo&s;t ardent Af|fection.</P>
<P>The King thought her Demand very high, but as he had given his Promi&s;e he was re&s;olved not to break it, and ordered <HI>Bertrand</HI> to be called; to whom he &s;aid; "Count, you are now grown a Man, and perfected in all the Accompli&s;hments of a Nobleman; it is my Will, therefore, that you &s;hould take upon you the Government of your Country, and carry with you the Dam&s;el I have given you for a Wife." "And who is that Dam&s;el, Sire, replied the Count?" "That is &s;he, &s;aid the King, who with her Medicines has re&s;tored me to Health."</P>
<P><HI>Bertrand,</HI> as &s;oon as he looked upon her, immediately remembered her; and though her Per&s;on appeared to him extremely hand&s;ome, yet, &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;proportion of her Birth to his, he an&s;wered, with great Di&s;dain, "What! Sire, would you give me a female Quack for a Wife?' God forbid I &s;hould ever be the Hu&s;band of &s;uch a Woman."</P>
<P>"Will you then, replied the King, make me break my Word with this young Maid, who demanded you for a Hu&s;band in Reward for re&s;toring me to Health?</P>
<P>"Sire, replied <HI>Bertrand,</HI> you may take away all I po&s;&s;e&s;s; and, by the Power you have over me, give me to whom you plea&s;e;

but, it is certain, I never &s;hall be contented with &s;uch a Marriage."</P>
<P>"You will be happy, no doubt, replied the King; the Dam&s;el is fair and wi&s;e; &s;he loves you ardently; and I hope you will enjoy a more agreeable Life with her, than with a Lady of noble Birth."</P>
<P><HI>Bertrand</HI> being &s;ilent, the King gave Or|ders to make great Preparations for the Nup|tials; and when the determined Day came, <HI>Bertrand,</HI> though unwillingly, married <HI>Gi|letta</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the King.</P>
<P>The Ceremony over, the Count, having taken his Re&s;olution, de&s;ired the King's Per|mi&s;&s;ion to return to his Country, there to con&s;ummate the Marriage: The King grant|ing his Reque&s;t, he mounted his Hor&s;e, but in&s;tead of going to <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> went into <HI>Tu&s;|cany,</HI> and knowing that the <HI>Florentines</HI> were at War with the Republic of <HI>Sienna,</HI> he offered his Service to the fir&s;t, who received him gladly, paid him great Honours, and gave him the Command of a Regiment, with large Appointments, which prevailed upon him to continue in their Service.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the new-married Lady, little plea&s;ed with &s;uch a Di&s;appointment, flattered her&s;elf, that by her prudent Behaviour, &s;he &s;hould be able to recall him; and being re|ceived at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> with all the Honours due to the Wife of Count <HI>Bertrand,</HI> &s;he applied her|&s;elf in the Ab&s;ence of her Lord to the Ma|nagement of his Affairs, which &s;he performed with &s;o much Solicitude and Di&s;cretion, that

<P>Having put every Thing at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> into exact Order, &s;he &s;ent two Gentlemen to her Lord, whom &s;he ordered to acquaint him, that if her Pre&s;ence was the Cau&s;e of his Ab|&s;ence from his Country, to make him ea&s;y, and to engage him to return, &s;he would quit <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> for ever.

<P>"Tell her &s;he may do what &s;he plea&s;es, and a&s;&s;ure her that I am determined never to live with her as my Wife, till &s;he gets this Ring which I wear on my Finger into her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and has a Son begot by me in her Arms; both which cannot po&s;&s;ibly happen, as I never intend to &s;ee her more."</P>
<P>The two Gentlemen thought the&s;e hard Conditions, and after long &s;olliciting him in vain to change his Purpo&s;e, returned to the Lady, and related to her his An&s;wer.</P>

<P>While &s;he was &s;peaking many Tears were &s;hed by the good People to whom &s;he addre&s;|&s;ed her&s;elf, who all humbly intreated her to change her Re&s;olution, and continue among them; but &s;he was immoveable, and recom|mending them to God, took Leave of them.</P>
<P>Then furni&s;hing her&s;elf with Money and rich Jewels, &s;he &s;et out in the Habit of a Pil|grim, attended by a Chambermaid and one of her Cou&s;ins, and took the Road to <HI>Florence,</HI> never &s;topping till &s;he reached that City.</P>
<P>Arriving there, &s;he hired a Lodging in a Inn which was kept by a good Widow, and pa&s;&s;ing for a poor Pilgrim, remained there in Hopes of hearing &s;omething about her Lord.</P>
<P>She had not been long in the Inn when <HI>Bertrand</HI> happened to pa&s;s by the Door on Hor&s;eback, with a great Retinue.</P>
<P><HI>Giletta</HI> knew him immediately, but endea|vouring to &s;uppre&s;s the Emotions his unex|pected Sight gave her; &s;he took Occa&s;ion as he pa&s;&s;ed, to enquire of her Landlady his Name and Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="190">Who replied that he was a Foreigner, cal|led Count <HI>Bertrand,</HI> remarkable for his Po|litene&s;s and Affability, and added, that he was very much in love with a Neighbour of hers, a young Woman well born, and very virtuous, but &s;o poor that no one was willing to marry her; and that her Mother being a di&s;creet, &s;en&s;ible Woman, perceiving the Count's Pa&s;&s;ion for her Daughter, took great Care to pre&s;erve her from his di&s;honourable Attempts.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s after enquiring and getting all the Information &s;he was able from her Landlady, concerning this Woman and her Daughter, retired to reflect upon what &s;he had heard, and weighing well every Parti|cular Circum&s;tance in her Mind, &s;he con|ceived a De&s;ign of turning the Count's Infi|delity to her own Advantage.</P>
<P>But concealing her Intentions from her two Attendants, &s;he went privately one Day in her Pilgrim's Habit to the Hou&s;e of her Rival, and ea&s;ily getting Admittance, found her Landlady had not mi&s;repre&s;ented the Condi|tion of the&s;e good People, who&s;e extream Poverty was very di&s;cernible from every Thing about them.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s on her Entrance &s;aluted the Mother with great Civility, and de&s;ired the Favour of &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e with her.</P>
<P>The Gentlewoman ri&s;ing, told her &s;he was ready to hear her, and led her into another
<PB N="178" REF="191">
Chamber, where as &s;oon as they were &s;eated, the Counte&s;s began in this Manner.</P>
<P>"My good Lady, I perceive that Fortune is as much your Enemy as mine, but if you are willing, 'tis in your Power to give your|&s;elf as well as me Con&s;olation."</P>
<P>The good Woman replied, "that &s;he de|&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to procure her&s;elf Relief, provided &s;he could do it hone&s;tly."</P>
<P>"'Tis nece&s;&s;ary then, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, that I &s;hould rely on your Fidelity, but if you deceive me, you will ruin my De&s;ign and hurt your own Intere&s;t."</P>
<P>"You may tell me whatever you plea&s;e with great Secre&s;y, replied the Gentlewoman, you &s;hall never find me deceitful."</P>
<P>"The Counte&s;s then beginning her Story with her Love of Count <HI>Bertrand</HI> while &s;he was yet a Child; pur&s;ued it through all its Circum&s;tances till &s;he brought it down to the pre&s;ent Time; relating every Thing in &s;o af|fecting and artle&s;s a Manner, that the good Woman could not doubt the Truth of what &s;he &s;aid, and began to have great Compa&s;&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>"'Tis only by your Means, added the Counte&s;s, that I can accompli&s;h tho&s;e two Conditions, upon which my Happine&s;s de|pends, if what I hear be true, that my Hu&s;|band loves your Daughter."</P>
<P>"I know not, Madam, replied the Gen|tlewoman, whether the Count really loves my Daughter, but I know that he makes great
<PB N="179" REF="192">
Profe&s;&s;ions of it; but what is it you would de&s;ire of me? how is it in my Power to &s;erve you?"</P>
<P>"I will tell you, replied the Counte&s;s, but fir&s;t you mu&s;t let me know how I &s;hall return the Obligation you are able to confer upon me?"</P>
<P>"I &s;ee your Daughter is hand&s;ome, and old enough to be married, and by what I have heard, and now ob&s;erve, you keep her at Home for want of a Portion to marry her, I intend therefore to reward the Service you may do me, by giving her immediately as much Money as you &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary to marry her honourably."</P>
<P>The good Woman, who was in great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, was plea&s;ed with the Offer, but being cautious and di&s;creet, replied,</P>
<P>"Madam, tell me what it is you require of me, and if I can do it hone&s;tly I will, and you &s;hall afterwards make what Acknowledg|ments you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t then, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, &s;end &s;ome Per&s;on in whom you can confide to Count <HI>Bertrand,</HI> to let him know that your Daughter will con&s;ent to his De&s;ires, but that in order to be convinced of the Truth of that Pa&s;&s;ion he pretends for her, he mu&s;t &s;end by her Me&s;&s;enger that Ring which he wears on his Finger, and that done, &s;he will be ready to grant all he requires.</P>
<P>"This Me&s;&s;age will certainly bring him to your Hou&s;e, I will be concealed in your Daughter's Chamber, and &s;upply her Place;
<PB N="180" REF="193">
perhaps I may be &s;o fortunate as to prove with Child by him, and thus by your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, having the Ring on my Finger, and a Child in my Arms begat by him, I may at la&s;t ac|quire his Affection, and prevail with him to live with me for the future as his Wife."</P>
<P>The good Woman was at fir&s;t &s;tartled at this Reque&s;t of the Counte&s;s's, fearing her Daughter's Reputation might &s;uffer if &s;he complied with it.</P>
<P>But reflecting that it would be a good Ac|tion to procure the Love of a Hu&s;band to a Wife that de&s;erved it; &s;he not only promi&s;ed the Counte&s;s to perform all &s;he de&s;ired, but in a few Days &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger with great Se|cre&s;y to the Count, who hearing the Me&s;&s;age, notwith&s;tanding he thought it hard to give away his Ring, complied with his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Command, and came to her Appointment.</P>
<P><HI>Giletta</HI> being dextrou&s;ly conveyed into the Chamber in&s;tead of the young Woman, the Count pa&s;&s;ed the Night with her, retiring very early the next Morning for fear of giving any Occa&s;ion for Slander; but he renewed his Vi&s;its every Night, always believing it was his beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s who received him.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s finding her&s;elf with Child, would no longer admit the nightly Vi&s;its of her Hu&s;band, and calling for her Benefactre&s;s, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Madam, I have (Thanks to God and your A&s;&s;i&s;tance) accompli&s;hed what I de&s;ired,
<PB N="181" REF="194">
and it is now Time to know what I can do for you in Return."</P>
<P>The good Woman told her &s;he might do what &s;he plea&s;ed, but that for her Part &s;he de|&s;ired no Reward for the Service &s;he had done her, having only in her Opinion done what &s;he ought.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf plea&s;ed with her mode&s;t Reply, but in&s;i&s;ted upon her naming a Portion for her Daughter.</P>
<P>The Gentlewoman thus con&s;trained with great He&s;itation and much Shame, a&s;ked a hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;eeing her Confu&s;ion, and admiring the Moderation of her Demand, gave her five Hundred Pounds in Money, and Jewels to the Value of five Hundred more, and taking Leave of the Mother and Daughter returned to her Inn.</P>
<P>The good Woman, who was enriched greatly beyond her Expectations, &s;ent Word to the Count to forbear his Vi&s;its, and retired with her Daughter into the Country to &s;ome of her Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Bertrand</HI> being informed that his Wi&s;e had left <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> yielded to the De&s;ires of his Peo|ple, and went thither, which the Counte&s;s hearing, was extremely plea&s;ed, and re&s;olved to &s;tay at <HI>Florence</HI> till &s;he was brought to Bed.</P>
<P>When the Time was expired &s;he was de|livered of two Sons, both very like their Fa|ther, and as &s;oon as &s;he was able to bear the Fatigue of Travelling &s;he left <HI>Florence,</HI> and
<PB N="182" REF="195">
came without being known by any one to <HI>Montpellier</HI>; there &s;he re&s;ted two or three Days, and then with her Children took the Road to <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P>On her Arrival &s;he enquired after the Health of her Lord, and hearing that he was well, and was that Day giving a great Fea&s;t to &s;ome Noblemen and Ladies in his Palace, &s;he pre&s;ented her&s;elf in the Hall where they were all a&s;&s;embled, wearing the Habit of a Pilgrim, in which &s;he had left <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> and holding her two Sons in her Arms: Then throw|ing her&s;elf at the Feet of her Husband with Tears &s;treaming from her Eyes, &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>"My Lord, I am your unhappy Wife, who, abandoned by you, did notwith&s;tanding apply my&s;elf diligently to the Management of your Affairs; I have long wandered mi&s;erably about the World, and now come to demand you in the Name of God, &s;ince I have been able to accompli&s;h tho&s;e two Conditions you propo&s;ed by the Gentleman I &s;ent to you; look on me, my Lord, and behold in my Arms not only one Son by you but two, behold likewi&s;e your Ring, and according to your Promi&s;e receive and acknowledge me for your Wife.</P>
<P>The Count, who had li&s;tened attentively to her, was &s;truck motionle&s;s with A&s;toni&s;h|ment. He knew the Ring, and ob&s;erved the Children to be very like him, and wholly lo&s;t in the Perplexity into which tho&s;e Accidents had thrown him, he a&s;ked her how it could be?</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="196">The Counte&s;s then, to the great Amaze|ment of her Lord and all who were pre&s;ent, related every Circum&s;tance that had happen|ed to her &s;ince her Departure from <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bertrand</HI> being convinced of the Truth of what &s;he &s;aid, was &s;truck with her Per|&s;everance and Wi&s;dom, and gazing on the Children, which he knew by their Re&s;em|blance to him to be his own, mindful of the Promi&s;e he had made her, and moved with the Remon&s;trances of the Ladies and Gentle|men that were with him, and the Intreaties of his People, who all conjured him to re|ceive and acknowledge her, his Ob&s;tinacy at la&s;t gave Way.</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed the Counte&s;s from her Knees, embraced her tenderly, acknowledged her to be his lawful Wife, and the Children &s;he brought with her his Sons. And then giving Orders for her being dre&s;t according to her Rank and Fortune, pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of that Day and many others following, in Fea&s;ting and rejoycing, to the great Satisfaction of all the People in <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P>From this Time he always lived with her as his Wife, e&s;teemed and honoured her for her Virtues, and loved her with the greate&s;t De|gree of Tenderne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the U&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made of the foregoing Novel in his Comedy of <HI>All's Well that ends Well.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fable of <HI>All's Well that ends Well.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>BERTRAM,</HI> the young Count of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> having lo&s;t his Father, is left un|der the Guardian&s;hip of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who &s;ends Orders for him to come to Court.</P>
<P><HI>Helena,</HI> the Daughter of a famous Phy&s;i|cian, lately decea&s;ed, being violently in Love with the Count, re&s;olves to follow him to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The old Counte&s;s of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> Mother to <HI>Bertram,</HI> who is very fond of <HI>Helena,</HI> being informed that &s;he was in Love with her Son, que&s;tions her about it, which after &s;ome eva|&s;ive An&s;wers, &s;he at la&s;t confe&s;&s;es, and al&s;o acknowledges her Intention to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> to offer her Service to cure the King, who was &s;ick of a Fi&s;tula, which by his Phy&s;icians was pronounced incurable.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s permits her to go, and the King, after many Intreaties, &s;ubmits to make U&s;e of her Medicine; which effects his Cure.</P>
<P><HI>Helena</HI> before the Trial obliges the King to promi&s;e, that if he was re&s;tored to Health by
<PB N="186" REF="198">
her Applications, he would give her her Choice of a Hu&s;band among tho&s;e Per&s;ons he had a Right to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P>Accordingly when the Cure is compleated, &s;he demands Count <HI>Bertram.</HI></P>
<P>The King orders him to marry her; he re|fu&s;es on account of the meanne&s;s of her Birth; the King in&s;i&s;ting upon his Obedience, <HI>Bertram</HI> at la&s;t complies, and &s;eemingly with great Wil|lingne&s;s, but when the Ceremony is performed, declares to a Confident that he hates his new Wife, and is determined never to live with her, but will go to the Wars in <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> to avoid it.</P>
<P>He then &s;ends a flattering Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Helena,</HI> and de&s;ires that &s;he will take Leave of the King immediately, and give him to under&s;tand that this &s;udden Parting proceeds from her own earne&s;t Inclinations to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Helena</HI> complies with this Injunction, and meeting her Lord, he excu&s;es his Ab&s;ence for two Days to her, gives her a Letter to carry to his Mother, and bids her ha&s;ten to <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P>She departs, and he having thus got rid of her, &s;teals immediately to <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>The old Counte&s;s of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI> is extremely enraged at the Contents of her Son's Letter, which informs her that he is determined never to live with his new Wife, and a Billet is delivered to <HI>Helena</HI> al&s;o, upon her Ar|rival at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> containing the&s;e Words. "When thou can&s;t get the Ring upon my Finger, which never &s;hall come off, and
<PB N="187" REF="199">
&s;hew me a Child begotten of thy Body that I am Father to, then call me Hu&s;band, but in &s;uch a then I write never."</P>
<P><HI>Helena</HI> in De&s;pair at this cruel Epi&s;tle, and de&s;irous that her Pre&s;ence might not bani&s;h her Lord from <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> &s;teals away at Night, leaving a Letter for her Mother-in-law, in which &s;he informs her that &s;he is gone a bare|foot Pilgrimage to St. <HI>Jaques,</HI> entreats her to recall her Son from the Wars, and declares, "that &s;he is going to embrace Death to give him Freedom;" however, &s;he &s;tops at <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> meets with a Widow, who&s;e Daughter, <HI>Diana,</HI> the Count was in Love with, and prevailing upon the&s;e two Women, by large Sums of Money, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her De&s;ign upon her Hu&s;band, &s;he &s;upplies <HI>Diana</HI>'s Place in the A&s;&s;ignation &s;he had made by her Advice with the Count, and gets the Ring which he had pre&s;ented her in her own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, giving him in Return another which &s;he had received from the King.</P>
<P>A feigned Account of her Death, confirmed by the Rector of the Place where &s;he died, being carried to <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> the old Counte&s;s &s;ends the News to her Son, entreating him to return, which he does immediately; and the King, being then at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> pardons the Count for his unkind U&s;age of <HI>Helena,</HI> who&s;e Lo&s;s he &s;eems greatly to regret, and the Daughter of an old Lord, named <HI>Lafeu,</HI> is propo&s;ed to him for a &s;econd Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Bertram</HI> eagerly embraces the Propo&s;al, de|claring "he had been violently in Love with
<PB N="188" REF="200">
the young Lady, which was the Cau&s;e of his Contempt for <HI>Helena."</HI></P>
<P>The Match being concluded on, <HI>Lafeu</HI> de|&s;ires his intended Son-in-law to give him &s;ome Token to &s;end his Daughter; upon which the Count pre&s;ents him with the Ring he had re|ceived from the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lafeu</HI> immediately recollects that he had &s;een that Ring upon <HI>Helena</HI>'s Finger, and the King looking at it, immediately declares that it was the &s;ame he had given her at parting.</P>
<P><HI>Bertram</HI> a&s;&s;ures them they were mi&s;taken; that the Ring never was <HI>Helena</HI>'s, but thrown to him from a Window in <HI>Florence</HI> by a Lady who was in Love with him.</P>
<P>The King, alarmed by the&s;e Fal&s;hoods, entertains a Su&s;picion that <HI>Bertram</HI> had mur|dered his Wife, and &s;ends him to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Helena,</HI> finding her&s;elf with Child, rides po&s;t with the Widow and her Daughter to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where &s;he had been informed the King was.</P>
<P>On her Arrival &s;he is told the King is at <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon</HI>; and meeting with a Gentleman belonging to the Court, who was going there, &s;he delivers a Petition to him, entreating him to pre&s;ent it to the King; the Gentleman pro|mi&s;es to do &s;o, and <HI>Helena</HI> and her A&s;&s;ociates follow him to <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman arrives with the Petition ju&s;t as the Count is carried off guarded, and the King receiving it reads it aloud; it is &s;igned <HI>Diana Capulet</HI>; who accu&s;es the Count of having debauched her at <HI>Florence</HI> under a Promi&s;e of Marriage when his Wife died, the
<PB N="189" REF="201">
Performance of which &s;he now claims, <HI>Helena</HI> being dead; and entreats the King would oblige him to do her Ju&s;tice; the Count is brought again into the King's Prefence, and <HI>Diana</HI> and her Mother appear to make good the Charge again&s;t him; which he denies, and calls his deified <HI>Diana</HI> a common Strumpet.</P>
<P><HI>Diana</HI> then produces the Ring which he had given <HI>Helena,</HI> when &s;he met him in her &s;tead; and claims the other which the Count had declared was thrown to him from a Win|dow, and &s;ays that &s;he gave it him in Bed; the Count, then acknowledges the Ring was her's; the King, who knew it was the &s;ame he had given to <HI>Helena,</HI> a&s;ks her if it was her's; &s;he provokes him by her eva&s;ive and contra|dictory An&s;wers, and he orders her to be car|ried to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Diana</HI> de&s;ires her Mother to get Bail for her, and immediately <HI>Helena</HI> appears, and tells her Lord &s;he had accompli&s;hed both the Conditions he had impo&s;ed on her; gives him back his Ring, and declares &s;he is with Child; upon which <HI>Bertram</HI> promi&s;es to love her for the future dearly; and the King takes upon him&s;elf the Care of providing <HI>Diana</HI> with a Hu&s;band, and paying her Portion.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> in his Comedy of <HI>All's Well that Ends Well,</HI> has followed pretty exactly the Thread of the Story in the foregoing Novel.</P>
<P>He has made U&s;e of all the Incidents he found there, and added &s;ome of his own, which po&s;&s;ibly may not be thought any Proofs
<PB N="190" REF="202">
either of his Invention or Judgment, &s;ince, at the &s;ame Time that they grow out of tho&s;e he found formed to his Hand, yet they grow like Excre&s;cences, and are equally u&s;ele&s;s and di&s;|agreeable.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed Death of <HI>Giletta,</HI> as &s;he is called in the Novel, or <HI>Helena,</HI> as &s;he is named in the Play, is wholly an Invention of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>; yet it produces nothing but a few Ambiguities in the Dialogue, which are far from entertaining, and a ba&s;e Su&s;picion of the Count's having murdered her, which he bears with a Tamene&s;s unbecoming the Cha|racter of a brave Soldier and a haughty No|bleman.</P>
<P>The Cata&s;trophe of the Story, though the &s;ame in the Play as the Novel, yet is very differently conducted in each: There is more Probability in the Incidents which lead to it in the Novel, and more Contrivance in tho&s;e of the Play.</P>
<P>The Reconciliation between the Count and his Lady is very natural and affecting in <HI>Boc|cace</HI>; in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> it is lo&s;t amid&s;t a Croud of perplexing and, in my Opinion, uninte|re&s;ting Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Character of the Heroine is more exalt|ed in the Original than the Copy.</P>
<P>In <HI>Boccace</HI> we &s;ee her, after her Marriage and the cruel Flight of her Hu&s;band, taking the Government of the Province in her own Hands, and behaving with &s;o much Wi&s;dom, Prudence and Magnanimity, as acquired her the Love and E&s;teem of the People, who all
<PB N="191" REF="203">
murmured again&s;t the Inju&s;tice of their Lord in not being &s;en&s;ible to &s;o much Merit; nor does &s;he endeavour to procure his Affection by a Stratagem, till &s;he has given Proofs that &s;he de&s;erved it.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;hews her oppre&s;&s;ed with De&s;|pair at the Ab&s;ence of the Count, incapable of either Advice or Con&s;olation; giving unne|ce&s;&s;ary Pain to the good Counte&s;s her Mother-in-law (a Character entirely of his own In|vention) by alarming her with a pretended De&s;ign of killing her&s;elf, and by &s;ome Means or other, which we are not acquainted with, gets the Rector of the Place, to whom &s;he had vowed a Pilgrimage, (which by the Way &s;he does not perform) to confirm the Report of her Death.</P>
<P>After having accompli&s;hed her De&s;ign of bedding with her Hu&s;band and procuring the Ring, &s;he rides Po&s;t to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> with the Widow and her Daughter, on Purpo&s;e to ex|po&s;e her beloved Hu&s;band to the King's Re|&s;entment, and the Contempt of all the Courtiers who were pre&s;ent; by making <HI>Diana</HI> complain to the King of the Count's having debauched her under a Promi&s;e of Marriage when his Wife was dead.</P>
<P>After &s;he has thus expo&s;ed the Frailties of her Hu&s;band, &s;he has the Cruelty to &s;uffer him to be accu&s;ed of having murdered her, and in Con&s;equence of that Accu&s;ation, &s;eized and impri&s;oned by the King's Order.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="204">The Di&s;covery of her Plot is attended with none of tho&s;e affecting Circum&s;tances we find in the Original.</P>
<P>After having made him endure &s;o much Shame and Affliction, &s;he haughtily demands his Affection as a Prize &s;he had lawfully won.</P>
<P>In <HI>Boccace</HI> &s;he kn&eacute;els, &s;he weeps, &s;he per|&s;uades; and if &s;he demands, &s;he demands with Humility.</P>
<P>In <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;he is cruel, artful, and in&s;o|lent, and ready to make U&s;e of the King's Authority to force her Hu&s;band to do her Ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Helena</HI> being thus ma|naged in the Play, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has with Art, made the old Counte&s;s (who is an amiable Character) bear Witne&s;s to the Vir|tues of <HI>Helena</HI>; for otherwi&s;e we &s;hould not have di&s;covered them; we mu&s;t therefore take her Word for it, that her Daughter-in-law is wi&s;e, gentle, prudent and virtuous; for, ex|cept her extreme Cunning, &s;he has nothing &s;triking in her Character; and, except her Per&s;everance, nothing amiable.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;urprizing, that <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> as he has followed &s;o exactly the Copy of <HI>Boccace,</HI> &s;hould deviate from him &s;o much in the Cha|racter of the two principal Per&s;ons in his Play, whom, at the &s;ame Time, he intends as well as the Noveli&s;t to make happy.</P>
<P>The Count &s;uffers rather more in his Hands than the Lady; in the Novel his greate&s;t Fault is flying from a Woman he had married, and

<HEAD>The Thirty-&s;ixth Novel of <HI>Bandello.</HI> Volume the Second.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN the Imperial City of <HI>Rome</HI> was taken and &s;acked by the united Arms of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> a rich Merchant of <HI>E&s;i,</HI> named <HI>Ambrogio,</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner among the re&s;t of the Inhabitants, This Merchant, by a Wife who was lately dead, had two Children, a Boy and a Girl, both, beyond all Imagination beau|tiful, and &s;o like each other, that when they were both dre&s;&s;ed in Boy's or Girl's Cloaths, it was difficult to know the one from the other; &s;o that the Father him&s;elf, who for his Diver&s;ion often tried the Experiment, was ex|tremely puzzled to di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio,</HI> who loved them with great Af|fection, &s;pared no Expence in their Educa|tion, but cau&s;ed them to be taught every Thing that was fit for their Birth and Fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="209">At the Time that <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;acked, they were about fifteen Years of Age.</P>
<P><HI>Paolo,</HI> &s;o was the Boy called, was taken Pri&s;oner by a certain <HI>German,</HI> who for his great per&s;onal Valour was held in high E&s;teem by his Nation.</P>
<P>This Man having taken &s;everal other Pri|&s;oners of con&s;iderable Rank, drew large Sums for their Ran&s;om; his Share of the Plunder had al&s;o been very great, having got a large Quantity of Gold and Silver Plate, many rich Jewels and Cloaths; &s;o that being very well &s;atisfied with his Gain he le&s;t <HI>Rome,</HI> and went to <HI>Naples,</HI> taking with him his little Captive <HI>Paolo,</HI> whom he loved and treated like his own Son.</P>
<P>The twin Si&s;ter of <HI>Paolo,</HI> who was called <HI>Nicuola,</HI> fell into the Hands of two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, and Fortune was &s;o favourable to her, that upon her telling them &s;he was Daughter to a very rich Man, they treated her with great Re&s;pect, in Expectation of receiving a con&s;iderable Sum for her Ran&s;om.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio,</HI> through the Favour of &s;ome <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Friends who were in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, avoided Captivity, and had al&s;o an Opportunity given him of concealing the great|e&s;t Part of his Trea&s;ure in a &s;ubterraneous Vault, but what remained in his Hou&s;e was pillaged.</P>
<P>This Lo&s;s he bore with great Indifference, Grief for his Children's Captivity, and his Endeavours to find them, taking up all his Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="210">After a diligent Search he at length found <HI>Nicuola,</HI> whom he redeemed for five Hundred Ducats, but all the Methods he could u&s;e to di&s;cover where <HI>Paolo,</HI> was proving ineffectual, he began to fear he was killed.</P>
<P>This Apprehen&s;ion filled him with exce&s;&s;ive Affliction, and no longer able to &s;tay in <HI>Rome,</HI> which continually renewed in his Mind the Remembrance of his lo&s;t Son, he returned to <HI>E&s;i,</HI> the Place of his Birth, and &s;atisfied with the Riches he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, quitted Merchandiz|ing entirely.</P>
<P>In this City there dwelt a rich Merchant, named <HI>Gerard Lanzetti,</HI> who&s;e Wife being lately dead, and he through his Intimacy with <HI>Ambrogio,</HI> having frequent Opportunities of &s;eeing the charming <HI>Nicuola,</HI> fell violently in Love with her; his own advanced Age, and the extream Youth of <HI>Nicuola,</HI> did not prevent him from demanding her in Marriage of her Fa|ther, a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame Time that he would take her without any Portion.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio</HI> had too much, Under&s;tanding, not to be &s;en&s;ible that &s;o unequal a Match could be productive of no good Con&s;equences; yet to avoid offending the old Lover, he would not give him an ab&s;olute Denial, but put him off, by &s;aying he had &s;till Hopes of recover|ing his Son, and could not think of parting with <HI>Nicuola</HI> till he heard &s;ome News of her Brother.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Fame of <HI>Nicuola</HI>'s extraordinary Beauty &s;pread through the whole

City of <HI>E&s;i,</HI> her Charms was the Subject of ge|neral Conver&s;ation. When &s;he went abroad the People gathered in Crouds to gaze on her, and the noble&s;t Youths in the City were continu|ally pa&s;&s;ing before her Windows, in Hopes of gaining a momentary Sight of her.</P>
<P>But he who was mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in watch|ing for Opportunities to &s;ee her, was a young Gentleman, named <HI>Lattantio Puccini,</HI> lately come to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an immen&s;e For|tune, by the Death of his Father and Mo|ther.</P>
<P>The diligent Attendance of this Youth be|fore her Windows, at la&s;t attracted the Ob|&s;ervation of <HI>Nicuola,</HI> who being charmed with the Gracefulne&s;s of his Per&s;on, and flat|tered by his con&s;tant A&s;&s;iduities, &s;hewed her|&s;elf frequently at her Window, and with be|witching Smiles and encouraging Glances, endeavoured to a&s;&s;ure him that &s;he was plea&s;ed with his Pa&s;&s;ion, which <HI>Lattantio</HI> perceiving, thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t Lover in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola,</HI> who found an irre&s;i&s;tible Sweetne&s;s in tho&s;e new De&s;ires that had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her young Bo&s;om, opened her whole Soul to the in&s;inuating Pa&s;&s;ion, which grew at la&s;t to &s;uch a Height, that Life was in&s;upportable to her unle&s;s &s;he &s;aw him every Day.</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio,</HI> no longer able to content him&s;elf with beholding his beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s at a Di&s;|tance only, was endeavouring to procure the Means of &s;peaking to her in private, when &s;ome urgent Affairs calling <HI>Ambrogio</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he propo&s;ed to &s;tay &s;everal Months, he
<PB N="201" REF="212">
was unwilling to leave <HI>Nicuola</HI> to the Care of Servants, and therefore took her to <HI>Fabriano,</HI> and left her with a Brother of his who had a Wife and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI>'s Departure from <HI>E&s;i</HI> was &s;o &s;ud|den and unexpected, that &s;he had no Time to inform her Lover of it, &s;o that he hearing her Father was gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed he had taken her with him, and remained for &s;ome Time extremely di&s;con&s;olate.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence however producing its u&s;ual Ef|fects, &s;o weakened the Idea of <HI>Nicuola</HI> in his Mind, that an accidental Sight of the fair <HI>Catella,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Gerard Lanzetti,</HI> entirely erazed the Remembrance of <HI>Nicuola,</HI> and he re&s;igned him&s;elf wholly up to the Influence of this new Charmer.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> on the contrary grieved beyond Mea&s;ure, at not having been able to inform her Lover of the Place to which &s;he was hurried, pa&s;&s;ed her Time in Sighs, Tears, and Com|plaints.</P>
<P>The rigid Au&s;terity of her Uncle, who kept her always in his Sight, made it impo&s;|&s;ible for her to fend a Letter or Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Lattantio</HI>; &s;o that this Re&s;traint adding a fret|ful Impatience to her Grief, &s;he thought every Hour of Ab&s;ence a thou&s;and Years, and wearied out by continual Anxiety and re&s;tle&s;s Wi&s;hes, &s;he fell into a deep and &s;ettled Melan|cholly, which not all the tender Con&s;olations of her Cou&s;ins, who thought it was occa&s;ion|ed by the Ab&s;ence of her Father, could re|move.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="213">In this Manner &s;he langui&s;hed &s;everal Months, at the End of which her Father left <HI>Rome,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Fabriano</HI> called for his Daughter, and returned to <HI>E&s;i.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> left <HI>Fabriano</HI> with as much Joy as a Soul long tortured in <HI>Purgatory</HI> feels at quit|ting it for <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> feeding her Imagination with the Tran&s;ports her Return would give her ravi&s;hed Lover, and enjoying by Antici|pation the exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure of an Interview after &s;o tedious an Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>But on her Arrival at <HI>E&s;i,</HI> the&s;e plea&s;ing Expectations were all changed to the mo&s;t racking Jealou&s;y. Report informed her that <HI>Lattantio</HI> was fallen in Love with <HI>Catella,</HI> and this cruel News was confirmed by his &s;hocking Indifference towards her&s;elf, for he took no more Notice of her than if he had never &s;een her before.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> now abandoned her&s;elf entirely to De&s;pair, the Infidelity of <HI>Lattantio</HI> was ten Times more in&s;upportable than his Ab&s;ence had been, and &s;o low was the unhappy Beauty reduced, as to endeavour by repeated Letters and Me&s;&s;ages to recall her&s;elf to his Re|membrance, but tho&s;e proving all ineffectual, &s;he re&s;olved to die, unle&s;s by &s;ome Means yet untried, &s;he could recover the Heart of her ungrateful <HI>Lattantio.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Nicuola</HI> was thus con&s;uming with an almo&s;t hopele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Ambrogio</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary to take another Journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> and as his Daughter was unwilling to go a &s;econd Time to her Uncle's at <HI>Fabriano,</HI> he
<PB N="203" REF="214">
placed her till his Return in a Mona&s;tery, where one of her Cou&s;ins, named Si&s;ter <HI>Cam|milla Bi&s;&s;a,</HI> was profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This Convent was formely in great Repu|tation for Sanctity, but <HI>Nicuola</HI> had been there but a &s;hort Time before the di&s;orderly Be|haviour of the Nuns gave her great Di&s;gu&s;t. Their Conver&s;ation, in&s;tead of turning upon the holy Lives of the Fathers, their Piety, their Ab&s;tinence, and good Works, were in|temperate, loo&s;e, and profane: Love was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives; they were not a&s;ham|ed to di&s;cover their Intrigues to each other, but would even boa&s;t of their &s;candalous Ap|pointments. In&s;tead of Fa&s;ting and Prayer, they indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t delicate Repa&s;ts and &s;lothful Ea&s;e. In&s;tead of wearing Shifts made of Hare-&s;kin next their Bodies, they wore Linen of the highe&s;t Prices, adorn|ing them&s;elves with the riche&s;t Silks and mo&s;t expen&s;ive Ornaments, heightening their na|tive Beauty with all the Embelli&s;hments of Art, and not &s;crupling even to make U&s;e of Paints, Wa&s;hes, and E&s;&s;ences, to &s;upply the Defects of Nature.</P>
<P>Thus adorned, and practi&s;ing all the allur|ing Artifices of loo&s;e Curtezans, they wa&s;ted whole Days in Di&s;cour&s;es with the young Rakes of the City, who &s;pent the greate&s;t Part of their Time at the Grate of their Con|vent.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola,</HI> extremely &s;candalized at the inde|cent Behaviour of the Nuns, often regretted her being placed in their Mona&s;tery, and finding no Alleviation of her Griefs among&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="215">
&s;uch di&s;agreeable Companions, &s;he gave her|&s;elf up to her &s;ecret Di&s;content.</P>
<P>It happened one Day when Si&s;ter <HI>Camilla</HI> was with her, that &s;ome body told that Nun, <HI>Lattantio,</HI> who often came there on account of Linens and fine Works which he em|ployed tho&s;e Nuns to make, wanted her at the Grate.</P>
<P><HI>Camilla</HI> went immediately, without taking Notice of <HI>Nicoula</HI>'s Di&s;order, who no &s;ooner heard the Sound of that Name than her fair Face and Bo&s;om was all over&s;pread with a glowing Red, which in a Moment changed to an a&s;hy Palene&s;s, and though her trembling Limbs were &s;carce able to &s;upport her, yet im|pelled by an eager De&s;ire to &s;ee again that much loved Face, and hear the dear Sound of his Voice, &s;he crept to a little Place, where un&s;een her&s;elf, &s;he might both hear and &s;ee her faithle&s;s Lover.</P>
<P>This Practice &s;he continued as often as &s;he had any Opportunity, and one Time when &s;he was thus employed, &s;he heard <HI>Lattantio</HI> complain to <HI>Camilla</HI> of his ill Fortune in lo&s;|ing a Page, who had &s;erved him three Years with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s and Fidelity. The Youth he told her was ju&s;t then dead of a Fever in his Hou&s;e, which gave him great Concern, becau&s;e he de&s;paired of ever get|ting another as faithful and affectionate as he had been.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <HI>Nicoula</HI> reflecting up|on this Incident, it came into her Head to di&s;|gui&s;e her&s;elf like a Boy, and &s;erve her Lover
<PB N="205" REF="216">
in the quality of a Page, but not knowing how to procure a Habit nece&s;&s;ary for her De|&s;ign, &s;he remained for &s;ome Time in more Di&s;content than ever.</P>
<P>At length &s;he took a Re&s;olution to acquaint her Nur&s;e with this new Scheme which Love had in&s;pired, and if po&s;&s;ible engage her A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in executing it.</P>
<P><HI>Phillippa,</HI> for that was the Name of her Nur&s;e, loved <HI>Nicuola</HI> with as much Tender|ne&s;s as if &s;he had been her own Child, and being de&s;ired by <HI>Ambrogio</HI> when he left <HI>E&s;i,</HI> to &s;ee his Daughter very often, and to take her when &s;he had an Inclination to her own Hou&s;e; &s;he never failed to vi&s;it her at the Con|vent every Day, and the Nuns, with whom <HI>Ambrogio</HI> had left Directions for that Purpo&s;e, permitted <HI>Nicuola</HI> to go out with her when|ever &s;he de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>To this good Woman <HI>Nicuola</HI> had entru&s;ted the Secret of her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Lattantio,</HI> and flattering her&s;elf that her Tenderne&s;s for her would make it ea&s;y to engage her A&s;&s;i&s;tance in a Scheme that her whole Soul was now bent upon accompli&s;hing, &s;he &s;ent for her one Day, and di&s;clo&s;ing her De&s;ign, earne&s;tly con|jured her to afford her the Means of exe|cuting it.</P>
<P><HI>Phillippa,</HI> after having for a long Time in vain endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her from an Attempt &s;o dangerous to her Reputation, at la&s;t con&s;ented to her De&s;ire, and taking her to her own Hou&s;e, furni&s;hed her with a Suit of
<PB N="206" REF="217">
Cloaths, which had belonged to her own Son, a Boy about <HI>Nicuola</HI>'s Age, who died a few Months before, and thus equipt &s;he went to the Street where her Lover lived.</P>
<P>Chance a&s;&s;i&s;ting her De&s;ign, brought <HI>Lat|tantio</HI> to the Door of his Hou&s;e, ju&s;t as <HI>Nicuolo</HI> entered the Street, which &s;he ob&s;erving, a&s;|&s;umed the Air and Manner of a poor Stran|ger ju&s;t arrived, gazing at every Thing &s;he &s;aw, and wandering backwards and forwards, as if at a Lo&s;s what Place to go to.</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> &s;truck with the Appearance of &s;o genteel and pretty a Youth, &s;tood &s;till for &s;ome Moments ob&s;erving him, and &s;uppo&s;ing the poor Boy might po&s;&s;ibly want a Service, he made a Sign to him as he pa&s;&s;ed by to ap|proach.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> accordingly came forward, and <HI>Lattantio</HI> being &s;till more plea&s;ed with him on a nearer View, a&s;ked him his Name, and whether he was born in <HI>E&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>"My Lord, replied <HI>Nicuola,</HI> my Name is <HI>Romulo,</HI> I was born in <HI>Rome,</HI> and lo&s;t my Fa|ther when the City was taken, my Mother died many Years before; I attended a Noble|man as his Page, who was mortally wounded when the City was &s;acked, and becau&s;e I wept and lamented his Misfortune, two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers beat me cruelly, and left me in a mi&s;erable Condition."</P>
<P>"If thou art willing to &s;erve me, &s;aid <HI>Lattantio,</HI> I will take thee to be my Page, and treat thee in &s;uch a Manner that thou &s;halt have no Cau&s;e to complain of thy Condi|tion."</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="218">"My Lord, replied <HI>Romulo,</HI> I accept your Offer with great Willingne&s;s, and de&s;ire no other Recompence for my Services than what you &s;hall judge they de&s;erve.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> accordingly entered that Day into his new Employment, in which he acquitted him&s;elf with &s;o much Diligence and Polite|ne&s;s, that in a few Days he entirely gained the Favour of his Ma&s;ter, who no longer re|gretted the Lo&s;s of his former Page, but thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t Man in the World, in the Attendance of &s;o genteel and &s;o faithful a Servant.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> was now clad in an elegant Livery, and finding his Services agreeable to his Ma&s;ter, and ble&s;t with his Sight and Conver&s;ation every Day, he would not have changed his Condition for a Place in Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid before, that <HI>Lattantio</HI> was enamoured of <HI>Catella,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Gerard Lanzetti, Nievola</HI>'s old Lover.</P>
<P>This young Lady ob&s;erving <HI>Lattantio</HI> pa&s;|&s;ing every Day before her Windows, and by his Looks and Actions endeavouring to &s;hew the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, always looked upon him with great Complacency, though her Heart was as yet wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;oft Power of Love, &s;o that <HI>Lattantio</HI> endeavoured in vain by repeated Letters and Me&s;&s;ages to prevail upon her to take &s;ome Re|&s;olution in his Favour.</P>
<P>The artful Fair-one, though &s;he was not di&s;po&s;ed to return his Love, yet being plea&s;ed
<PB N="208" REF="219">
with his A&s;&s;iduities, would not entirely de|prive him of Hope, but while &s;he carefully avoided coming to any Explanation with him, by her encouraging Looks and Smiles &s;he kept his Hopes alive, and encrea&s;ed his De&s;ire.</P>
<P>The extream Avarice of her Father, notwith|&s;tanding his great Riches, was the Cau&s;e that <HI>Catella</HI> had all the Opportunities &s;he could wi&s;h to indulge her coquet Di&s;po&s;ition, for <HI>Gerard</HI> kept only three Dome&s;tics in his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e was an old Woman, who hardly ever &s;tirred from the Fire-&s;ide, another a Lackey, who always went abroad with him; the third a young Maid-&s;ervant, who being bribed by <HI>Lattantio,</HI> left the young Lady the Liberty of &s;howing her&s;elf at the Window as much as &s;he plea&s;ed, and every Day brought her a Letter or Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Lattantio.</HI></P>
<P>The unhappy Lover finding all his Sollici|tations hitherto fruitle&s;s, conceived a De&s;ign of &s;ending <HI>Romulo</HI> to intercede for him, hop|ing from a Form and Youth, &s;o engaging, and an Addre&s;s &s;o in&s;inuating, to induce her to make &s;ome Return to his ardent Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Accordingly giving his Page the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions, he ordered him immediately to go to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Catella.</HI></P>
<P>Poor <HI>Romulo</HI> received this Commi&s;&s;ion with a breaking Heart, and ha&s;tily quitting his Ma&s;ter's Pre&s;ence, ran to his good old Nur&s;e to acquaint her with this new Misfor|tune.</P>

<P><PB N="210" REF="221"><HI>Phillippa</HI> was &s;o moved with the Tears and Complaints of this her dear fo&s;ter Child, that for &s;ome Time &s;he could do nothing but weep. Recovering her&s;elf at la&s;t, you a&s;k my Advice, my dear Daughter, &s;aid &s;he, alas! how often have I given it you in vain, when in di&s;cour&s;ing to me of your unhappy Love, I fore&s;aw, and would have prevented the fatal Con&s;equence of it?</P>
<P>Now then I be&s;eech you pay more regard to my Council; re&s;ume your own Dre&s;s, and either remain with me or go back to the Mona&s;tery, and I will take care your Adven|ture &s;hall never be known to your Father; 'tis po&s;&s;ible he may return &s;oon to <HI>E&s;i,</HI> and I would not for all the Wealth in the World he &s;hould di&s;cover you in this Dre&s;s, the Con&s;e|quence would be fatal to both you and me.</P>
<P>Quit then this dangerous Scheme, my dear <HI>Nicuola,</HI> you &s;ee <HI>Lattantio</HI> is every Day more enamoured of <HI>Catella,</HI> and you labour in vain to recal his Affection. Why will you hazard your Life and Honour in &s;o hopele&s;s an Enterprize? All the Reward you can ex|pect for this unworthy Servitude is eternal In|famy both to your&s;elf and Family. Nor is this all; your Father may perhaps &s;acrifice your Life to the Honour of your Hou&s;e, which he will think you have di&s;graced; how mean, how unworthy is it for one of your Sex, your Birth and Education, to per&s;i&s;t in loving one who de&s;pi&s;es you? to follow one who flies from you? Ah, when I was of your Age I was never guilty of &s;uch Weakne&s;s, I

was pur&s;ued, I did not pur&s;ue, I &s;corned others, but was not &s;corned my&s;elf: Collect your &s;cat|tered Rea&s;on, my dear Daughter, quit all Thoughts of this ungrateful Man, and place them on one more worthy your Affection.</P>
<P>There are many noble Youths in this City who would e&s;teem it a Happine&s;s to gain you for a Wife; but if your Adventure &s;hould be di&s;covered, depend upon it, you would find it very difficult to get a Hu&s;band; how are you &s;ure <HI>Lattantio</HI> has not already di&s;covered you, and in Contempt of your Weakne&s;s means to take &s;ome Opportunity of making you &s;ub|&s;ervient to his loo&s;er Plea&s;ures? Oh! my <HI>Ni|cuola,</HI> beware in Time, &s;tay here with me, and &s;hun all the Dangers which threaten your Innocence, your Reputation and your Life."</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> li&s;tened attentively to her Nur&s;e's Di&s;cour&s;e; and when &s;he had ended it, &s;tood for &s;ome Moments fixed in Thought, then &s;ighing deeply "My dear Mother, &s;aid &s;he, I acknowledge that your Advice is ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable; but, alas!

<P>I will go to <HI>Catella,</HI> and perform my Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ee whether I am able to prevail with her: <HI>Lattantio</HI> has yet had only general An&s;wers from her, perhaps &s;he may refu&s;e him: God, who knows my Heart, knows that I only de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Lattantio</HI> with Ho|nour: Providence, perhaps, will at length favour my blamele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion: In the mean time, I will call here every Day, and acquaint

you with every thing that happens to me; and if my Father &s;hould come home &s;uddenly, we mu&s;t provide in the be&s;t Manner we can for the Honour of our Hou&s;e; it is, perhaps, as great a Degree of Folly to anticipate Evil by Apprehen&s;ions, as to indulge one's Self in a blind Security."</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> then embracing the good old Wo|man, who, &s;ilently grieved at the Ob&s;tinacy &s;he could not cure, went away, and arrived at <HI>Catella</HI>'s Hou&s;e ju&s;t as her Father, attended by his Lackey, went out.</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI>'s Maid being at the Door, he in|formed her that he was &s;ent by <HI>Lattantio</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age to her Lady, and de&s;ired her to procure him Admittance to her.</P>
<P>The Girl, &s;hewing him into a ground Par|lour, ran up &s;tairs to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and, out of Breath with Joy, cried, "Oh! Madam! <HI>Lattantio</HI> has &s;ent his beautiful Page, whom you have &s;o often admired, to &s;peak to you."</P>
<P>Where is he? interrupted <HI>Catella</HI> impa|tiently; and being told by the Maid that &s;he had ventured to bring him into the Hou&s;e, and that he was waiting for her in the Par|lour; <HI>Catella</HI> with eager Ha&s;te flew to him, and entering the Room, was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed with a nearer View of that miraculous Beauty which had charmed her at a Di&s;tance, that for &s;ome Moments &s;he doubted if &s;he was not in the Pre&s;ence of an Angel.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo,</HI> making her a low Reverence, de|livered the Me&s;&s;age his Ma&s;ter had &s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="224"><HI>Catella</HI> heard him with an inconceivable De|light, not becau&s;e the Purport of his Words plea&s;ed her, but the Sound of that enchanting Voice conveyed an unu&s;ual Tran&s;port to her Heart; lo&s;t in &s;ilent Admiration, &s;he &s;tood contemplating the lovely Form before her, while her &s;oft Bo&s;om heaved with, till then, unknown De&s;ires; then breathing an ardent Sigh, and darting a Glance at him, which bet|ter than the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Words ex|plained the tender Pa&s;&s;ion which had taken a full and ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Soul: "Why, Oh lovely and too dangerous Youth, &s;aid &s;he, why do you hazard thus your Life by coming to me on &s;uch a Bu&s;ine&s;s? Alas! if my Father &s;hould return and find you here, the Con&s;e|quence would be fatal both to you and me."</P>
<P><HI>Romulo,</HI> who had well ob&s;erved her pa&s;&s;ion|ate Looks, the Changes of her Colour, and the interrupting Sighs that made her Words al|mo&s;t unintelligible, was per&s;uaded &s;he had entertained a Pa&s;&s;ion for him, and plea&s;ed be|yond Mea&s;ure at this happy Accident, he a&s;|&s;umed more Earne&s;tne&s;s in his Looks and Voice.</P>
<P>"It is fit, Madam, &s;aid he, that a Servant &s;hould in all Things obey the Will of his Ma&s;ter; and dangerous as this Emba&s;&s;y is, yet I undertook it willingly at his Command, who has a Right to all my Obedience; &s;end me not away then I conjure you, Madam, without a favourable An&s;wer; but have
<PB N="214" REF="225">
Compa&s;&s;ion on my Ma&s;ter, who loves you with the mo&s;t ardent Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable."</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI> &s;uffered him a long Time to &s;olicit her in this Manner, without making him any An&s;wer; when at la&s;t, &s;eeing him about to leave her, and vanqui&s;hed by the irre&s;i&s;tible Force of her Pa&s;&s;ion: "Oh! Heavens! cried &s;he, in a langui&s;hing Voice, what you de&s;ire of me, charming Youth, I cannot grant; you your|&s;elf make it impo&s;&s;ible: Alas! by what En|chantment have you thus robbed me of my&s;elf?"</P>
<P>You divert your&s;elf, Madam, at my Ex|pence, replied <HI>Romulo</HI>; I am no Enchanter, and have practi&s;ed no Arts upon you; all I want is to prevail upon you to let me carry my Ma&s;ter &s;ome agreeable News, who cannot live if you continue thus inexorable; &s;peak, Madam, will you allow me to give him Hopes that you will relent?"</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI> continuing &s;ilent, <HI>Romulo,</HI> bowing with a di&s;contented Air, moved towards the Door; when &s;he, rouzed by that Action, and no longer able to re&s;train her&s;elf, ha&s;tily &s;natched his Hand, and lifting up her fine Eyes to Heaven, "Oh! cried &s;he, in a faultering Voice, to what am I reduced!" then fixing them with a pa&s;&s;ionate Look on his Face, "No Man in the World but you, &s;aid &s;he, could have made me thus forget what I owe to my&s;elf; I love you, charming Youth; I can|not live unle&s;s you return my Pa&s;&s;ion; leave a Servitude &s;o unworthy of you, and be the Lord of me and all I have: I a&s;k not to know your Birth or Fortune; mine can &s;upply the Di&s;advantages of both; all I require of you is
<PB N="215" REF="226">
to quit the Service of <HI>Lattantio,</HI> whom I can never love, and from this Moment will never give a favourable Glance to, and devote your|&s;elf entirely to me."</P>
<P><HI>Romulo,</HI> finding the Bu&s;ine&s;s would go on as he wi&s;hed, after &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Catella,</HI> promi&s;ed her to be wholly guided by her Will; a&s;&s;uring her he would always mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge the Honour and Hap|pine&s;s to which &s;he rai&s;ed him; but at the &s;ame Time earne&s;tly entreated her to act with all imaginable Caution in the Affair between them, to prevent its coming to the Know|ledge of <HI>Lattantio,</HI> who, if he di&s;covers my good Fortune, added he, will not fail to &s;a|crifice me to his Revenge.</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI> promi&s;ing to follow his Advice im|plicitly, <HI>Romulo</HI> ki&s;&s;ed her Hand with a re|&s;pectful Tenderne&s;s, a&s;&s;uring her he would &s;ee her very &s;oon again, and then went home, where he found his Ma&s;ter waiting for him with an anxious Impatience.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> then told him, "that he was obliged to wait a long Time before he could procure Admittance to <HI>Catella,</HI> whom he found highly incen&s;ed again&s;t him, as well on Account of the &s;evere chiding &s;he had ju&s;t then &s;uffered from her Father for encouraging his Love, as becau&s;e &s;he had been informed that he had formerly loved a young Lady of that City very pa&s;&s;ionately: I u&s;ed my utmo&s;t Endevaours, added <HI>Romulo,</HI> to remove this Su&s;|picion from her Mind, but all in vain; and &s;he
<PB N="216" REF="227">
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with an A&s;&s;urance that &s;he would never &s;ee you more."</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> was extremely afflicted at this &s;ad News; he made his Page repeat &s;everal times all the Arguments he had u&s;ed to <HI>Catella</HI> in his Favour, and afterwards entreated him to take another Opportunity of &s;peaking to her on the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> promi&s;ed to do all that lay in his Power for him: The next Day the di&s;con|tented <HI>Lattantio</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through the Street where his Mi&s;tre&s;s lived, in hopes of &s;eeing her, <HI>Catella,</HI> who was at her Window, no &s;ooner e&s;pied him &s;tanding oppo&s;ite to it, than darting a dreadful Frown at him, &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew, leaving him overwhelmed with Grief at this Confirmation of his Misfortune.</P>
<P>The unhappy Lover returned to his Hou&s;e, and &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his Chamber with <HI>Romulo,</HI> began to lament his unfortunate De&s;|tiny; and being greatly mortified at the con|temptuous Treatment he received from <HI>Catel|la,</HI> he broke into Invectives and Reproaches again&s;t her.</P>
<P><HI>Romulo</HI> &s;eeing his Ma&s;ter moved as he de|&s;ired, began to rea&s;on on the fanta&s;tic Effects of Love, and pur&s;uing his Di&s;cour&s;e, "How often does it happen, &s;aid he, that a Man be|comes violently enamoured with a Lady who repays his Pa&s;&s;ion with Indifference and Di&s;|dain; and, while he con&s;umes away in hope|le&s;s Wi&s;hes for her, &s;ome unhappy Fair-one langui&s;hes in Secret for him."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="228">"Your Ob&s;ervation is very ju&s;t, returned <HI>Lattantio,</HI> and the &s;ame Thing has happened to my&s;elf: Some Months ago I was beloved by one of the mo&s;t beautiful Virgins in this City, who was lately come from <HI>Rome</HI>; I per|ceived her Pa&s;&s;ion, and I returned it with the mo&s;t ardent Affection; but &s;he left the City, and I could not di&s;cover to what Place &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>"In the mean time I happened to &s;ee this haughty Beauty, who&s;e Charms took &s;o ab&s;o|lute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Heart, that all Remem|brance of the other was totally era&s;ed.</P>
<P>"The Fair-one I had abandoned returned to <HI>E&s;i,</HI> and by Letters expo&s;tulated with me on my Infidelity, and tenderly endeavoured to recal my Affection; but I was &s;o wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed by my Pa&s;&s;ion for the ungrateful <HI>Ca|tella,</HI> that I never took any Notice of her re|peated Complaints."</P>
<P>"Ah! my Lord, replied <HI>Romulo,</HI> Love has well revenged your Injuries to Love; <HI>Ca|tella</HI> by her Di&s;dain of you repays without de|&s;igning it your Infidelity to one who gave you her Heart without Re&s;erve; and it is po&s;&s;ible the unhappy Maid you have abandoned wa&s;tes her Days in fruitle&s;s Wi&s;hes, and loves you &s;till though hopele&s;s of ever being beloved again."</P>
<P>"I know not that, &s;aid <HI>Lattantio,</HI> but it is certain I did once love her with a mo&s;t ardent Affection, for &s;he was beautiful as an Angel; and <HI>Catella,</HI> (ah! how Cruelty has altered her) <HI>Catella</HI> compared to her is all Deformity; to &s;ay the Truth, added <HI>Lattantio,</HI> looking fixed|ly

<P>"I will do all I can for you, replied <HI>Ro|mulo</HI>; and though I was &s;ure of peri&s;hing in the Attempt, I would return to her again and plead for you."</P>
<P>But here we mu&s;t quit for a while the un|faithful Lover and his di&s;gui&s;ed Mi&s;tre&s;s, to relate what happened to <HI>Paolo</HI> the lo&s;t Bro|ther of <HI>Nicuola.</HI></P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter, the <HI>German,</HI> having turned all the rich Moveables he had got at the &s;acking of <HI>Rome</HI> into Money, prepared to leave <HI>Na|ples,</HI> and return to his own Country; when he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent Fever, of which he died in a few Days; having by his Will left <HI>Paolo</HI> Heir of all his Wealth.</P>
<P>The fortunate <HI>Paolo,</HI> now free, and in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large Fortune, having cau&s;ed his Patron to be honourably interred, took Po&s;t for <HI>Rome</HI>; and there enquiring for his Father, was told, he was gone to <HI>E&s;i,</HI> whither he al&s;o went.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of going directly to his Father's Hou&s;e, he alighted at an Inn, and leaving his
<PB N="219" REF="230">
Baggage to the Care of his Servants and his Ho&s;t, he went out alone, and took his Way to the Street where his Father lived; happen|ing to pa&s;s by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gerardo Lanzetti, Catella</HI> being as u&s;ual at her Window, &s;pied him, and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be <HI>Romulo,</HI> was greatly &s;urprized at his walking on without taking any Notice of her.</P>
<P>Her Father not being at home, &s;he ordered her Maid to run after him and tell him &s;he de|&s;ired to &s;peak with him: The Girl did as &s;he was directed; and overtaking <HI>Paolo,</HI> "Sir, &s;aid &s;he, come back immediately; my Lady ex|pects you."</P>
<P><HI>Paolo,</HI> by his Reque&s;t, and the Girl's fa|miliar Manner of acco&s;ting him, &s;uppo&s;ed he was mi&s;taken for another Per&s;on, and re&s;olved within him&s;elf to &s;ee who this Lady was; and beginning to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he was &s;ome Curte|zan; "I will &s;ee the End of this Adventure, thought he, and try my Fortune; but the La|dy will be deceived if &s;he thinks to get much Money from me; I will give her but half a Crown at the mo&s;t."</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Moment that <HI>Paolo,</HI> conducted by the Maid, arrived at the Door of the Hou&s;e, <HI>Gerardo</HI> appeared at the Head of the Street: The Girl &s;eeing him, turned ha&s;tily to <HI>Paolo,</HI> "Oh, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, there is my Ma&s;ter yonder; walk hereabout, he will not &s;tay long, when he goes out again I will come and let you know."</P>
<P><HI>Paolo</HI> accordingly went away, having fir&s;t taken good Notice of the Hou&s;e that he might know it again.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="231">The Girl, as &s;oon as he was gone, ran in and &s;hut the Door, without being perceived by <HI>Gerardo,</HI> who, walking lei&s;urely, as old Men do, gave her Time enough; and ar|riving at his Hou&s;e, knocked at the Door, and was let in by the Girl, highly plea&s;ed that he had not di&s;covered her.</P>
<P><HI>Paolo,</HI> who &s;taid at a little Di&s;tance to ob|&s;erve the old Man, had a Glimp&s;e of <HI>Catella,</HI> who was &s;tanding at a Window, and was charmed to a Degree of Rapture with her Beauty.</P>
<P>His Thoughts being now wholly engro&s;&s;ed by this fair Unknown, he walked pen&s;ively on to his Father's Hou&s;e, end &s;eeing the Windows &s;hut, he enquired of a Shopkeeper where <HI>Am|brogio Nanni</HI> lived, who told him he had not been &s;een <HI>E&s;i</HI> for &s;everal Months pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Paolo</HI> then returned to his Inn, langui&s;hing with an eager De&s;ire to &s;ee again the Fair-one that had charmed him: But doubting le&s;t there might be &s;ome Danger in the Adventure, he re&s;olved to take one of his Servants with him when he went to &s;ee her again.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Ambrogio</HI> returned, as has been related, and <HI>Gerardo</HI> going out of his Hou&s;e met him; and after he had welcomed him to <HI>E&s;i,</HI> added, <HI>"Ambrogio,</HI> you are come in good Time, for I am weary of Delays, and am determined to know at once whether you will give me your Daughter or no?"</P>
<P>You &s;ee, an&s;wered <HI>Ambrogio,</HI> that I am but ju&s;t arrived; we &s;hall have Lei&s;ure enough
<PB N="221" REF="232">
to talk of this Affair when I have a little re|covered the Fatigue of my Journey."</P>
<P>While the two old Men were talking in this Manner, <HI>Ambrogio</HI> on Hor&s;eback, <HI>Gerardo</HI> on foot, <HI>Romulo,</HI> who was going to <HI>Catella,</HI> en|tered the Street, and &s;eeing her Father returned, ran away terrified almo&s;t out of her Sen&s;es, and went to her Nur&s;e's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"Oh, my dear Mamma, &s;aid &s;he, out of Breath with Fear and Ha&s;te, my Father is come back; what &s;hall I do?"</P>
<P>"I will go to him, repied <HI>Philippa,</HI> and in the mean Time do you put on your own Cloaths, and do not &s;tir from hence till my Return."</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola,</HI> now no longer <HI>Romulo,</HI> having re&s;umed her own Dre&s;s, <HI>Philippa</HI> went to <HI>Ambrogio,</HI> who had ju&s;t di&s;mounted and was entering his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The old Woman &s;aluted him with a chear|ful Countenance, expre&s;&s;ing great Joy at his &s;afe Return: <HI>Ambrogio</HI> having thanked her, enquired for his Daughter.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw her this very Morning, &s;aid the good Nur&s;e, and &s;taid a great while with her in the Convent: How the dear Child will be tran&s;ported to hear of your Arrival! I had Her frequently at my Hou&s;e during your Ab&s;ence, &s;ometimes &s;he has &s;taid with me four or five Days together: Truly &s;he is a fine Girl, and works admirably well with her Needle: With your leave, Sir, added &s;he, I will go to the Convent and inform her of your Return, and carry her to my Hou&s;e, where &s;he may &s;tay a

few Days till your's is put in order to receive her."</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio</HI> con&s;enting, the old Woman took her Leave; but before&punc; &s;he went home, &s;he called at the Convent to &s;ettle Matters with &s;i&s;ter <HI>Camilla,</HI> who being a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of Intrigue, &s;he a&s;&s;ured <HI>Philippa</HI> that <HI>Nicuola</HI>'s Ab&s;ence from the Convent &s;hould do her no Hurt, for &s;he would punctually follow all her Directions.</P>
<P><HI>Philippa,</HI> very well &s;atisfied with her Suc|ce&s;s, returned home, where <HI>Nicuola</HI> impatient|ly expected her; &s;he de&s;ired her to compo&s;e her&s;elf for all was now &s;afe; and then related di&s;tinctly all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and told her &s;he was at Liberty to go home the next Day to her Father, or to &s;tay with her for &s;ome Days; <HI>Nicuola</HI> cho&s;e the latter; and being now freed from her tormenting Apprehen|&s;ions of being di&s;covered to her Father, &s;he gave a Loo&s;e to her Grief on <HI>Lattantio</HI>'s Ac|count; her Pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to gather new Fire from the Difficulties which oppo&s;ed it, and &s;he re&s;olved to accompli&s;h her De&s;ires or die.</P>
<P><HI>Philippa</HI> combated the&s;e Thoughts with all the Rea&s;on &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of; drawing Ar|guments from her de&s;pair to induce her to forget <HI>Lattantio</HI>: "You may be now con|vinced, &s;aid &s;he, that <HI>Lattantio</HI> loves <HI>Catella</HI> with inexpre&s;&s;ible Ardour, and will never think of any other Woman, and in a &s;hort Time no Doubt will a&s;k her of her Father in Mar|riage."</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="234">"Ah! this is what I dread, replied <HI>Nicuo|la,</HI> weeping; Oh! &s;piteful Fortune! my Fa|ther's &s;udden Return has broke all my De|&s;ign; I had conceived Hopes, and with Rea|&s;on too, of putting <HI>Lattantio</HI> into &s;uch Di&s;|grace with <HI>Catella</HI> that &s;he would &s;ooner con|&s;ent to marry a Moor than him; but my Fa|ther's unlucky Return has ruined me."</P>
<P>"Ruined you! interrupted <HI>Philippa,</HI> &s;ay rather that his Return has pre&s;erved you from Ruin; if it be true what you have told me concerning <HI>Catella</HI>'s Fondne&s;s for you, I fore|&s;ee nothing but Shame and Mi&s;ery can attend the Pro&s;ecution of your De&s;igns: Had you gone back to her again, the &s;hamele&s;s Wan|ton would by &s;ome Means or other have cer|tainly di&s;covered your Sex; and the Con&s;e|quence would be eternal Infamy to you; &s;ince being per&s;uaded her&s;elf you was the Strumpet of <HI>Lattantio,</HI> &s;he would per&s;uade the World to believe you &s;o too."</P>
<P>"That &s;he &s;hould believe me the Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Lattantio,</HI> replied <HI>Nicuola,</HI> is what my Wi&s;hes aimed at; yet this could not have hurt my Character; for though &s;he di&s;covered my Sex, &s;he had no Opportunity of knowing my Name and Family, and <HI>Lattantio</HI> would have appeared &s;o treacherous and ungrateful to her, that &s;he would never again have endured him in her Sight."</P>
<P><HI>Philippa</HI> could not be convinced by his fal&s;e Rea&s;oning of <HI>Nicuola</HI>'s: "Set your Heart at Re&s;t, my Child, &s;aid &s;he; for no human Arts can change the Decrees of Providence:
<PB N="224" REF="235">
If it be the Will of God that <HI>Catella</HI> &s;hould be the Wife of <HI>Lattantio,</HI> all your Artifices to prevent this Union will be fruitle&s;s: Quit this hopele&s;s Enterprize then, and attend to your real Happine&s;s; you are young, beautiful and rich; your Brother <HI>Paolo,</HI> poor Youth! is certainly dead, or el&s;e, in all this Time, we &s;hould have had &s;ome Accounts of him; by his Death (God re&s;t his Soul) if you behave well, you will inherit your Father's whole E&s;tate; with this blooming Youth, this beau|tiful Per&s;on, and the&s;e great Riches, do you imagine you can want the Addre&s;&s;es of many noble Youths, among whom you may fix upon one more lovely than <HI>Lattantio</HI>?"</P>
<P>While <HI>Philippa</HI> and <HI>Nicuola</HI> wa&s;ted the Time in the&s;e Kinds of Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>Paolo</HI> em|ployed his in walking before the Windows of <HI>Catella</HI> in Hopes of &s;eeing her again; and <HI>Lat|tantio,</HI> who &s;taid at home impatiently, ex|pecting the Return of his Page, &s;aw the Night approaching with great Surprize, not know|ing to what Cau&s;e he &s;hould attribute his long Stay.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed the whole Night in the mo&s;t tor|menting Su&s;pence, fearing &s;ome Misfortune had happened to the Youth whom he tenderly loved on Account of his Fidelity, the Sweet|ne&s;s of his Manners, and the exact Attention with which he waited on him: Nor was <HI>Ca|tella</HI> free from a re&s;tle&s;s Inquietude; &s;he loved <HI>Romulo</HI> with extreme Ardour, and wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to be united to him for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="236"><HI>Nicuola,</HI> who&s;e ardent Pa&s;&s;ion rendered her incapable of ta&s;ting the &s;oft Ble&s;&s;ings of Sleep, &s;pent the Night in &s;ighing and talking of <HI>Lat|tantio</HI> to her Nur&s;e, whom &s;he would not &s;uffer to take any more Repo&s;e than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Morning now approached, and <HI>Lat|tantio</HI> not &s;eeing <HI>Romulo</HI> appear, ro&s;e in great Agitation of Mind, and went about the Town &s;eeking him, and enquiring of every one whom he thought could give him any Intelli|gence of him.</P>
<P>While he was thus employed, a Shopkeeper who had li&s;tened to the De&s;cription he gave of the Per&s;on and Dre&s;s of his lo&s;t Page, in|formed him that he &s;aw &s;uch a Youth go into the Hou&s;e of an old Woman, named <HI>Philip|pa,</HI> who lived near the great Church.</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio,</HI> thanking the Man for his In|formation, accepted his Offer of &s;hewing him the Hou&s;e; and knocking at the Door, <HI>Phi|lippa</HI> opened a Window, and a&s;ked him what he wanted? "Good Woman, &s;aid <HI>Lattantio,</HI> with your Leave, I &s;hould be glad to &s;peak ten Words to you." "Oh! a hundred, replied <HI>Philippa,</HI> who knew him, and was almo&s;t out of her Wits with Surprize and Joy; then clo&s;ing the Window, &s;he told <HI>Nicuola</HI> who was below, and ran down ha&s;tily to let him in.</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> entering the Hou&s;e, was &s;eated by the good Woman in a Place where <HI>Nicuola</HI> could hear and &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed; <HI>Lattantio</HI> then obliging <HI>Philippa</HI> to &s;it near him, thus be|gan: "My good Woman, it may appear

<P>"My Son, replied the old Woman, I thank you for your good Opinion of me, and for having deigned to honour my poor Habita|tion with your Pre&s;ence, an Honour, which indeed I have for &s;ome time ardently wi&s;hed for, having &s;ome particular Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;|cour&s;e with you upon; and &s;ince you have been plea&s;ed to give me this Opportunity, I will make U&s;e of it: But fir&s;t as to the Que&s;|tion you a&s;ked me concerning your Page; I do a&s;&s;ure you I can give you no Account of him;

<P>"Upon the Faith of a Chri&s;tian, &s;aid <HI>Phi|lippa,</HI> neither Man or Boy was in this Hou&s;e ye&s;terday; and I am &s;orry I cannot an&s;wer your Demand; I would do it very willingly if I was able."</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> here breathing a deep Sigh, <HI>Phi|lippa</HI> looked earne&s;tly on him; "The&s;e ar|dent Sighs, &s;aid &s;he, and this re&s;tle&s;s Anxiety on Account of your Page, might per&s;uade any other Per&s;on that you loved him too well; but I have often heard that you loved a very beautiful young Lady, &s;o that I cannot ea&s;ily believe you to be an Enemy to Women."</P>
<P>"Would to Heaven, replied <HI>Lattantio,</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately, that I did not love, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t Man in the World: Yes, my good <HI>Philippa,</HI> you have been truly informed; there is a young Lady in this City whom I love more than my own Soul:" The&s;e Words he accompanied with a profound Sigh; Tears at the &s;ame Time falling fa&s;t from his Eyes, notwith&s;tanding all his Endeavours to re&s;train them.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="239"><HI>Philippa</HI> &s;eeing him &s;o &s;oftened, thought &s;he had now an Opportunity to &s;peak more fully to him: "I know well, my Son, &s;aid &s;he, in a &s;oothing Accent, that an unfortunate Lover is the mo&s;t unhappy Being in the World; no Grief is equal to that of loving without being beloved again; this is your Ca&s;e, and my Soul melts with Compa&s;&s;ion for you."</P>
<P>"How do you know this &s;o certainly? in|terrupted <HI>Lattantio,"</HI> rouzed to Attention by her Words.</P>
<P>"Enquire not how I came to know it, re|plied &s;he, it is &s;ufficient that I do know you love and are not beloved; and &s;ome Months ago you loved a Lady more beautiful than your pre&s;ent Mi&s;tre&s;s, who returned your Pa&s;|&s;ion with equal Warmth; now at this very Moment I am convinced &s;he langui&s;hes and dies for you, ungrateful as you are, and you no longer pre&s;erve the lea&s;t Remembrance of her."</P>
<P>"I know not that, an&s;wered <HI>Lattantio,</HI> though you may perhaps, for methinks you are perfectly well acquainted with my Affairs; tell me then, I be&s;eech you, by what Means you know the Lady I love at pre&s;ent be&s;tows her Affection on another?"</P>
<P>"I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer that Que&s;tion, replied <HI>Philippa,</HI> and you mu&s;t pardon me if I tell you that you are ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by the Di&s;dain of one Lady for your Infidelity and Ingratitude to the other; and happy will it be for you if your Puni&s;hment &s;tops here."</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="240">"Ah! poor <HI>Nicuola,</HI> added &s;he, rai&s;ing her Voice, lovely and unfortunate Maid! what ha&s;t thou not done to recall the Affection of this unfaithful Man? but all in vain; while he, in&s;en&s;ible of thy Charms, and unmoved by tho&s;e Proofs of unalterable Affection which thou ha&s;t given him; follows the haughty <HI>Ca|tella</HI> with a rejected Love, and meanly &s;ues to one who hates and de&s;pi&s;es him."</P>
<P>The Youth, lo&s;t in Amazement at hearing all the&s;e Particulars from one whom he thought had been an ab&s;olute Stranger to him, gazed on her in Silence, not knowing what to an&s;wer. While <HI>Nicuola</HI> &s;tood trembling in her Con|cealment, her Heart beating with anxious Ex|pectation, Fear and Hope taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Soul by Turns. <HI>Philippa</HI> expecting <HI>Lat|tantio</HI>'s Reply, continued &s;ilent; and he re|covering a little from his Surprize and Con|fu&s;ion, beholding her with an earne&s;t Look thus &s;poke:</P>
<P>"Since you are &s;o well acquainted with my Affairs, <HI>Philippa,</HI> I will &s;peak freely and at large to you."</P>
<P>"'Tis true, I was once enamoured of <HI>Nicuola Nanni,</HI> and I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to think &s;he had al&s;o an Affection for me.

wholly changed; I &s;ent my Page to her with a Me&s;&s;age Ye&s;terday, but he never re|turned to bring me an An&s;wer, &s;o I have at once lo&s;t all Hopes of gaining the Object of my Affections, and am abandoned by a Ser|vant for whom I had a great E&s;teem."</P>
<P>"Had he returned, and informed me that &s;he was re&s;olved to per&s;evere in her unju&s;t Di&s;|dain, I would have endeavoured to conquer my Pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;po&s;e my&s;elf to love one to whom my Services would be more accepta|ble; for indeed I am convinced it is a great Degree of Madne&s;s to follow one who flies from me, and to love a Woman who is re|&s;olved never to return my Pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"I am glad you are grown &s;o rea&s;onable, my Son, &s;aid the good Woman, but pray an&s;wer me truly to one Que&s;tion: If <HI>Nicuola,</HI> whom you once loved, &s;hould continue &s;till to love you in &s;pite of your Infidelity, with a mo&s;t ardent Affection, what would &s;he de&s;erve from you?"</P>
<P>"Truly <HI>Philippa,</HI> replied <HI>Lattantio,</HI> in that Ca&s;e &s;he de&s;erves that I &s;hould love her more than my&s;elf; however it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould continue to love me, &s;eeing that I have injured her &s;o ba&s;ely; not only in abandon|ing her for a Per&s;on far le&s;s amiable than her|&s;elf, but in never returning any An&s;wer to many Letters which &s;he &s;ent me; &s;o that I mu&s;t appear to her the mo&s;t ungrateful of Mankind."</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all this, replied <HI>Philippa,</HI> &s;he loves you &s;till, loves you with an un&s;haken
<PB N="231" REF="242">
Con&s;tancy; and often in Confidence has &s;he declared to me, that &s;he not only did love you with as much Violence as ever, but would continue to do &s;o while &s;he lived."</P>
<P>"Oh! it cannot be, interrupted <HI>Lattantio,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible, why &s;hould you endeavour to deceive me?"</P>
<P>"I do not deceive you, replied <HI>Philippa,</HI> I can give you convincing Proofs of what I &s;ay, <HI>Nicuola</HI> loves you more than ever; for you &s;he for&s;ook her Father's Hou&s;e, for you &s;he forgot the Delicacy of her Sex, the Riches &s;he was born to, and the Rank &s;he held in Life, and &s;ubmitted to do you all the Offices of a menial Servant. Nay, be not a&s;toni&s;hed, pur&s;ued &s;he, for all this the lovely and too loving <HI>Nicuola</HI> did for you; tell me then, if I make it appear plainly that &s;he has done this, what does &s;he de&s;erve?"</P>
<P>"You tell me Wonders, replied <HI>Lattantio,</HI> Things which &s;urpa&s;s Belief, yet if they are true, without doubt <HI>Nicuola</HI> merits all my Love, which I can &s;hew no other Way than by being hers for ever."</P>
<P><HI>Philippa</HI> having brought him to the Point &s;he de&s;ired, ro&s;e up ha&s;tily, and bid the trem|bling Maid, who had heard all that pa&s;&s;ed, dre&s;s her&s;elf immediately in her Boy's Cloaths; which being done, &s;he led her into the Room where <HI>Lattantio</HI> was; her Face all covered with Blu&s;hes, and her fine Eyes bent on the Ground in a &s;weet Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Behold, &s;aid <HI>Philippa,</HI> pre&s;enting her to <HI>Lattantio,</HI> behold your <HI>Nicuola,</HI> behold your

<HI>Romulo,</HI> your &s;o much de&s;ired Page, this is &s;he who de&s;pi&s;ed the whole World for your Sake, and with the utmo&s;t Hazard of her Life and Honour waited on you Night and Day."</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio,</HI> lo&s;t in A&s;toni&s;hment at what he heard and &s;aw, continued &s;ilent and immovable in his Chair, his Eyes fixed on the blu&s;hing Maid, who not being able to meet his Looks, hid her averted Face with one of her Hands, while <HI>Philippa</HI> related her whole Story.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible! cried <HI>Lattantio,</HI> recovering from his Amazement, can <HI>Nicuola</HI> have done &s;o much for me? Oh! I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful, the mo&s;t dete&s;table of all human Beings, if I could be in&s;en&s;ible to &s;uch match|le&s;s Tenderne&s;s and Truth: I will not wa&s;te Time in needle&s;s Excu&s;es for my pa&s;t Faults, &s;aid he, ri&s;ing, and approaching <HI>Nicuola</HI>; but if it be true, that you love and pardon me, from this Moment I vow to be only your's, and will make you my Wife whenever you plea&s;e."</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola,</HI> who now &s;aw her&s;elf arrived to the Summit of all her Wi&s;hes, could hardly contain the &s;welling Tran&s;port; and turning her fine Eyes on <HI>Lattantio,</HI> big with unuttera|ble Joy and Love, &s;he held out her Hand to him, which he received and ki&s;&s;ed pa&s;&s;ionate|ly.</P>
<P>"My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, receive my Faith, which I now give you, with an A&s;&s;urance that your Will from henceforward &s;hall be always mine; and that the Name and Quality of
<PB N="233" REF="244">
Wife &s;hall not hinder me from continuing &s;till to be the mo&s;t obedient of your Servants."</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> then taking a Diamond from his own Finger put it on her's, and in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Philippa</HI> &s;olemnly contracted him&s;elf to her. That done, he de&s;ired her to change her Dre&s;s immediately and go home with <HI>Philippa</HI> to her Father's, whither he intended &s;hortly to fol|low them and demand her of <HI>Ambrogio</HI> for his Wife.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Paolo,</HI> full of a re&s;tle&s;s In|quietude, left his Inn as &s;oon as he had dined, and returned to the Street where <HI>Catella</HI> lived, and &s;tanding before her Windows, he anxiou&s;ly waited for another View of that &s;prightly Fair|one, who&s;e Charms had already taken an ab|&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Catella,</HI> who longed as impatiently to &s;ee again the lovely Page, no &s;ooner &s;pied <HI>Paolo</HI> &s;tanding in the Street and gazing up at the Window, than &s;uppo&s;ing him to be <HI>Romulo,</HI> &s;he ha&s;tily called her Maid, "Yonder is <HI>Ro|mulo,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, waiting for Admittance, go and let him in; my Father is now abroad, I can &s;ee him with Safety."</P>
<P>The Girl obeyed her Orders; and <HI>Catella</HI> running down Stairs with eager Ha&s;te met <HI>Paolo</HI> as he entered, and taking him with her into a Room, "Oh <HI>Romulo!</HI> Oh my Love! &s;aid &s;he, how tedious has the Time appeared &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t! and Oh! how long are you in taking Re&s;olutions! but I will not part with you now, continued &s;he, throwing her Arms about his Neck, and reclining her Face on his Shoulder, with a langui&s;hing Sweetne&s;s,
<PB N="234" REF="245">
No, my lovely Youth, I will not part with you till you have told me whether I am to live or die; for if you will not be mine, certainly Life will be in&s;upportable to me."</P>
<P>Live, charming Maid, &s;aid the tran&s;ported <HI>Paolo,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing her to his Brea&s;t with incon|ceivable Ardour, live and di&s;po&s;e of the De&s;ti|ny of your <HI>Romulo."</HI></P>
<P>At this Moment <HI>Gerardo,</HI> finding his Door open, walked in &s;oftly, and hearing a &s;trange Voice in the Parlour, he entered precipitately. At the Sight of a Man with his Daughter, he was going to give Vent to a Rage which might have had fatal Effects, had it not been &s;uddenly allayed by a Sight of <HI>Paolo</HI>'s Face, which was &s;o like <HI>Nicuola</HI>'s that he immediate|ly concluded it was that fair Maid dre&s;t in the Habit of a Boy: Po&s;&s;e&s;t with this Belief he approched the Lovers, and taking <HI>Paolo</HI> by the Hand, <HI>"Nicuola,</HI> &s;aid he, it is well thou art not what thou &s;eem'&s;t to be, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould make both thee and <HI>Catella</HI> repent this Familiarity:" then turning to his Daughter, he bid her go up to her Chamber and leave <HI>Nicuola</HI> with him, "for I, added the old Man, &s;miling, am fitter Company for her than you."</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI> obeyed and left the Room, much wondering at her Father's Moderation, and at his calling the Youth <HI>Nicuola</HI>; but being well plea&s;ed that &s;he had e&s;caped &s;o ea&s;ily, &s;he re|&s;olved patiently to wait the Event.</P>
<P><HI>Paolo,</HI> on the other Hand, was full of un|ea&s;y Confu&s;ion, not knowing how the old
<PB N="235" REF="246">
Man would behave to him, &s;eeing that he took him for his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>"My dear <HI>Nicuola,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Gerardo,</HI> why are you thus di&s;gui&s;ed? How comes it that <HI>Am|brogio,</HI> your Father, &s;uffers you to go about alone in this Manner? Tell me the Truth; what was the Cau&s;e of your coming hither? Did you want to &s;ee what Sort of a Hou&s;e I keep, and in what State I live? I &s;poke to your Father two Days ago about giving you to me for a Wife, and I have in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing his Re&s;olution &s;oon; I a&s;&s;ure you, you will be very happy in having me for a Hu&s;band; you &s;hall govern my Hou&s;e, and command me in all Things: Why art thou &s;ilent, my <HI>Nicuola?</HI> Speak, and tell me thy Mind."</P>
<P>The old Man, at the fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, made an Offer of ki&s;&s;ing the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Ni|cuola,</HI> who pu&s;hing him away roughly, &s;aid, "Forbear this Freedom, &s;peak to my Father, and &s;uffer me to depart; I came here by mere Accident, and without any De&s;ign."</P>
<P>"I will let you go &s;ince you will have it &s;o, &s;aid <HI>Gerardo,</HI> and will &s;ee your Father pre|&s;ently, and fini&s;h this Affair."</P>
<P><HI>Paolo</HI> accordingly left him, and went to his Father, who had ju&s;t given his Con&s;ent that <HI>Lattantio</HI> &s;hould marry his Daughter, he having come there to demand her.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio,</HI> at the unexpected Sight of his long-lo&s;t Son, was ready to expire with Joy; who, after the fir&s;t Care&s;&s;es were over, ac|quainted him with his good Fortune, and the great Riches that had been bequeathed to
<PB N="236" REF="247">
him. The joyful Father, &s;eeing his Daughter &s;o happily married, and his Son return with &s;o much Wealth, thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t Man in the World.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the mutual Congratulations of this happy Family, <HI>Gerardo</HI> arrived, and was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at the Sight of <HI>Paolo</HI> and his Si&s;ter together, that he doubted whether he was awake or a&s;leep.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrogio</HI> relieved him from his Perplexity, by telling him of the unlooked-for Return of his Son; informing him al&s;o that he had mar|ried <HI>Nicuola</HI> to <HI>Lattantio,</HI> and then, at <HI>Paolo</HI>'s earne&s;t Entreaty, he de&s;ired him to give him his Daughter for a Wife.</P>
<P>The old Man was at fir&s;t much affected at the Lo&s;s of his intended Bride; but &s;eeing there was no Remedy, he re&s;olved to bear it patiently, and con&s;ented that <HI>Catella</HI> &s;hould marry <HI>Paolo.</HI></P>
<P>Both the&s;e Marriages were performed the &s;ame Day, to the great Satisfaction of the four Lovers, who lived ever after with the greate&s;t Harmony imaginable.</P>

<P>It has hitherto been uncertain whether the Story of <HI>Twelfth-Night,</HI> or <HI>What You Will,</HI> was borrowed from any Novel, or an Inven|tion of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Langbaine,</HI> in his <HI>Account of the Dra|matic Poets and their Writing,</HI> &s;ays, that he knows not from whence that Play was taken, but the Re&s;emblance of <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> to his Si&s;ter <HI>Viola</HI> was doubtle&s;s fir&s;t borrowed, not only by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> but all our &s;ucceeding Poets, from <HI>Plautus,</HI> who has made U&s;e of it in &s;everal Plays, as <HI>Amphitrio, Maenechmi,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is really &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the Admirers of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;o &s;olicitous to prove he was very conver&s;ant with the Antients; they take all Opportunities to find in his Writings Illu&s;ions to them; Imitations of their Thoughts and Expre&s;&s;ions! and will not &s;cruple to allow their Favourite to have been guilty of &s;ome little Thefts from their Works, provided it will make out his Claim to an Acquaintance with them.</P>
<P>It is very much to be doubted whether or not he under&s;tood the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Lan|guages, &s;ince we find he made U&s;e of Tran|&s;lations from both when he borrowed of their Authors; and &s;till le&s;s probable is it that he under&s;tood and &s;tudied the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, when he, who was &s;o clo&s;e a Copyer has never imitated them in their chief Beauties,

<P><PB N="242" REF="253">But <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had a much more ample Sup|ply for the Fable of this Comedy in the fore|going Novel, from whence he undoubtedly drew it, and which not only furni&s;hed him with the Hint of the Re&s;emblance between <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Viola,</HI> but al&s;o with the greate&s;t Part of the Intrigue of the Play.</P>

<P>Though <HI>Shak&s;pear</HI> has copied the Noveli&s;t in all the&s;e Particulars, yet he differs from him in others, which very much le&s;&s;ens the Proba|bility of the Story.</P>
<P><HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Viola</HI> in the Play are parted by a Shipwreck, and <HI>Viola</HI> is ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Illyria</HI>; but we are not told with what In|tention this Brother and Si&s;ter embarked, or whither their Voyage was bound.</P>
<P>The Poet had Occa&s;ion for them in <HI>Illyria,</HI> and there they are at the Service of the Au|dience; no Matter if introduced with Propriety or not; we mu&s;t be contented to take them as we find them: Well; <HI>Viola,</HI> after giving &s;ome Tears to the Memory of her Brother, whom &s;he fears is drowned, is de&s;irous of being re|commended as an Attendant to a Lady with whom the Sovereign of the Country is in love; but being told it would be difficult to procure Admi&s;&s;ion to her, &s;he all of a &s;udden takes up an unaccountable Re&s;olution to &s;erve the young Batchelor-Duke in the Habit of a Man; take it in her own Words addre&s;&s;ed to the Captain of the wreck'd Ve&s;&s;el:

<P><PB N="244" REF="255">A very natural Scheme this for a beautiful and virtuous young Lady to throw off all at once the Mode&s;ty and Re&s;ervedne&s;s of her Sex, mix among Men, her&s;elf di&s;gui&s;ed like one; and, pre&s;t by no Nece&s;&s;ity, influenced by no Pa&s;&s;ion, expo&s;e her&s;elf to all the dangerous Con&s;equences of &s;o unworthy and &s;hameful a Situation.</P>
<P>We find this Incident managed with much more Decency in the Novel.</P>
<P><HI>Nicuola</HI> is violently in love with and beloved by <HI>Lattantio</HI>; and finding that, during a &s;hort Ab&s;ence from him, he became enamoured of <HI>Catella,</HI> upon hearing he had lo&s;t his Page and wanted another, &s;he di&s;gui&s;es her&s;elf like a Boy, and offers her Service to wait upon him with a View of recalling his Affections by this extraordinary In&s;tance of her Tenderne&s;s and Fidelity, and of &s;eizing every Opportunity of traver&s;ing his new Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Catella.</HI></P>
<P>This Project, though not altogether pru|dent and wi&s;e, was far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Temper and Circum&s;tances of <HI>Ni|cuola,</HI> &s;timulated as &s;he was by Love, Jealou&s;y and De&s;pair, to attempt &s;omething extraordi|nary for the Recovery of her Lover.</P>
<P>But what are <HI>Viola</HI>'s Motives for &s;o ra&s;h an Enterprize? She is neither in love with or abandoned by the Duke, and cannot rea&s;onably propo&s;e to her&s;elf any Advantage by thus hazarding her Virtue and Fame: His Per&s;on &s;he had never &s;een; his Affections &s;he was in|formed
<PB N="245" REF="256">
were engaged; what then were her Views and De&s;igns by &s;ubmitting to be his Attendant?</P>
<P><HI>Bandello</HI> does not even make <HI>Nicuola</HI> re&s;olve upon &s;uch an Expedient till the De&s;ign was &s;ugge&s;ted to her by over-hearing <HI>Lattantio</HI> la|ment the Lo&s;s of his Page and wi&s;h for ano|ther.</P>
<P>But the Novelli&s;t is much more careful to pre&s;erve Probability in his Narration than the Poet in his Action: The Wonder is that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;hould borrow &s;o many Incidents from him, and yet ta&s;k his Invention to make tho&s;e Incidents unnatural and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Olivia,</HI> the Duke's Mi&s;tre&s;s, for the di&s;gui&s;ed Lady, is attended with Cir|cum&s;tances that make it appear highly impro|bable and ridiculous: She is repre&s;ented as a noble and virtuous Lady, overwhelmed with Grief for the Death of a beloved Brother; her Grief indeed is of a very extraordinary Na|ture, and in&s;pired her with &s;trange Re&s;olu|tions according to the Report of <HI>Valentine,</HI> the Duke's Servant, who had been &s;ent by him with a Me&s;&s;age to her:</P>

<L><PB N="246" REF="257">Shall not behold her Face at ample View;</L>
<L>But, like a Cloy&s;tre&s;s, &s;he will veiled walk,</L>
<L>And water once a Day her Chamber round</L>
<L>With eye-offending Brine: All this to &s;ea&s;on</L>
<L>A Brother's dead Love, which &s;he would keep fre&s;h</L>
<L>And la&s;ting in her &s;ad Remembrance.</L>
</SP>
<P>This &s;orrowful Lady, however, makes her fir&s;t Appearance in the Company of a Je&s;ter, with whom &s;he is extremely diverted; and not|with&s;tanding her Vow which we are told of in another Place, hot to admit the Sight or Company of Men, &s;he permits the Duke's Page to approach her, &s;hews him her Face, and bandies Je&s;ts and &s;mart Sentences with all the lively Wit of an airy Coquet.</P>
<P>Then follows her &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;up|po&s;ed Youth, which is as &s;uddenly declared, without any of tho&s;e Emotions that Ba&s;hful|ne&s;s, Delicacy, and a De&s;ire of pre&s;erving the Decorum her Sex and Birth oblige her to ob|&s;erve, mu&s;t rai&s;e in the Mind of a Woman of Honour.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> by mixing &s;o much Levity in the Character of <HI>Olivia,</HI> de&s;igned a Satire on the Sex, he would have certainly led us by &s;ome Reflexions on the Incon&s;i&s;tency of her Behaviour to have made that Inference; but this is not the Ca&s;e; for <HI>Olivia</HI> is every where highly extolled for her Virtues.</P>
<P>It is his injudicious Conduct of the Fable that gives &s;o much Impropriety to the Man|ners of his Per&s;ons, at lea&s;t in this In&s;tance,
<PB N="247" REF="258">
which is the more &s;urprizing, as the Novel furni&s;hed him with one much better contrived, and Characters more &s;uitable to the Action.</P>
<P><HI>Catella</HI> acts the &s;ame Part in the Novel that <HI>Olivia</HI> does in the Play; but <HI>Catella</HI> is a young gay libertine Girl, who&s;e Birth was but mean, and Education neglected; it was not there|fore &s;urprizing that &s;he &s;hould &s;o ea&s;ily fall in Love with a Page, indecently court him, and re&s;olve to marry him, &s;uch an incon&s;iderate Conduct was agreeable to her Character; but in the noble and virtuous <HI>Olivia,</HI> 'tis unnatu|ral and ab&s;urd, and what makes it &s;till more &s;o is, that as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has ordered the Mat|ter, <HI>Olivia</HI> is di&s;gracefully repul&s;ed by this Youth, and yet continues her Suit, whereas <HI>Cattella</HI> meets with a ready Compliance from the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Romulo,</HI> who &s;ees his De&s;igns on <HI>Lattantio</HI> likely to &s;ucceed by his Mi&s;tre&s;s's fortunate Pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P><HI>Olivia</HI>'s taking <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> the Brother of the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Viola,</HI> for the beautiful Page, and marrying him, is with very little Variation borrowed from <HI>Bandello</HI>: but <HI>Paolo</HI> in the Novel is much more naturally introduced than <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> in the Play.</P>
<P><HI>Paolo</HI> comes to <HI>E&s;i</HI> to &s;eek for his Father and Si&s;ter, but we are not acquainted with <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>'s Motives for going to <HI>Illyria</HI>; the Poet indeed had Bu&s;ine&s;s for him there, and there he lugs him without the lea&s;t Shadow of
<PB N="248" REF="259">
a Rea&s;on for it, which is left to the Imaginati|on of the Reader to &s;upply.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of <HI>Lattantio</HI> in the Novel is more natural and con&s;i&s;tent, than the Duke's in the Play: They both marry the Women that had attended on them di&s;gui&s;ed, but the Difference of their Stations, Circum&s;tances, and Characters, makes the &s;ame Action na|tural in one, which in the other is ab&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
<P><HI>Lattantio</HI> had been in Love with <HI>Nicuola,</HI> but her Ab&s;ence, joined to the natural Incon|&s;tancy of Youth, &s;o wild and incon&s;iderate as his, transferred his Affections from her to <HI>Catella</HI>; &s;he &s;lights him, and he being inform|ed that his abandoned <HI>Nicuola,</HI> impelled by the Violence of her Pa&s;&s;ion for him, had di&s;|gui&s;ed her&s;elf in Boy's Cloaths, and waited on him as his Page; he repents of his Fal&s;e|hood, and charmed with her Tenderne&s;s and Fidelity makes her his Wife.</P>
<P>This Conduct in <HI>Lattantio</HI> is very natural, but why &s;hould the Duke, a &s;overeign Prince who &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately adored <HI>Olivia,</HI> all at once take a Re&s;olution to marry <HI>Viola,</HI> a Stranger whom he had never &s;een in her proper Garb, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;erved him in Di&s;gui&s;e; 'tis ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e he could in a Moment pa&s;s from the mo&s;t extravagant Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable for <HI>Olivia,</HI> to one no le&s;s extravagant, for a Per&s;on, whom till then he had always believed to be a Boy; and 'tis al&s;o highly improbable that a great Prince would &s;o &s;uddenly re&s;olve
<PB N="249" REF="260">
to marry a Girl, who had no other Title to his Favour than an imprudent Pa&s;&s;ion, which had carried her greatly beyond the Bounds of Decency.</P>
<P>The Duke's Rea&s;ons for this extraordinary Action are far from being convincing.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Duke</HI> to <HI>Viola.</HI></STAGE>
<Q><L>Your Ma&s;ter quits you; and for your Service done him,</L>
<L>So much again&s;t the Metal of your Sex,</L>
<L>So far beneath your &s;oft and tender Breeding;</L>
<L>(And &s;ince you call'd me Ma&s;ter for &s;o long)</L>
<L>Here is my Hand, you &s;hall from this Time be</L>
<L>Your Ma&s;ter's Mi&s;tre&s;s.</L></Q>
<P>And as <HI>Viola</HI> at fir&s;t had not even Love to plead as an Excu&s;e for her indecent Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;he is &s;till le&s;s worthy of the Fortune &s;he was rai&s;ed to.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of true Comic Hu|mour in the inferior Characters of this Play, which are entirely of the Poet's Invention; the Mi&s;takes <HI>Antonio</HI> is led into by the Re&s;em|blance of <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Viola,</HI> are no doubt Hints borrowed from the <HI>Amphitrio</HI> and the <HI>Maenechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> for which it is proba|ble he con&s;ulted the <HI>French,</HI> or rather the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lations of tho&s;e Comedies extant in his Time; but the&s;e Mi&s;takes, however
<PB N="250" REF="261">
diverting, take their Ri&s;e from a very impro|bable Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio,</HI> a Sea Captain, delivers <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> from the Fury of the Waves; the Youth be|ing ob&s;tinately determined to go to the Court, <HI>Antonio,</HI> who in a Sea-fight had done great Mi&s;chief to the Duke's Galleys, re&s;olves, out of the Violence of his Friend&s;hip, to follow him thither, notwith&s;tanding he knew his Life would be in manife&s;t Danger if he was &s;een in <HI>Illyria.</HI></P>
<P>How unaccountably extravagant is this Kind|ne&s;s in a Stranger? what more could a long continued Friend&s;hip, confirmed by mutual Obligations have produced?

<P>The Inhabitants of the we&s;tern I&s;les, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Macdowald,</HI> &s;oliciting for a Par|don, he fined in large Sums, and tho&s;e he found in <HI>Lochaber,</HI> who had come thither to bear Arms again&s;t the King, he put all to the Sword.</P>
<P>The&s;e Troubles were &s;carcely appea&s;ed, when Advice was brought that <HI>Sueno</HI> King of <HI>Norway</HI> was landed in <HI>Fife,</HI> with a power|ful Army to invade all <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This News rou&s;ing the King from that State of Indolence and Inactivity in which he was buried, he rai&s;ed Forces with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, &s;haring the Command of them with <HI>Banquo</HI> and <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>The Battle, which &s;oon after followed, proved fatal to the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>Norweigens</HI> were victorious, and <HI>Duncan</HI> fled to <HI>Bertha</HI>; here after &s;pending &s;ome Time in feigned Treaties
<PB N="254" REF="265">
with his Enemies, he &s;ent Orders to <HI>Macbeth,</HI> who &s;till kept Part of the routed Army about him, to fall upon the <HI>Danes,</HI> who he was in|formed were all di&s;&s;olved in Luxury and Ea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth</HI> marched ha&s;tily to the Place where the <HI>Danes</HI> were encamped, and fir&s;t killing the Watch, made a &s;avage Slaughter of the wretched <HI>Danes,</HI> whom he found fa&s;t a&s;leep in full Security after a drunken Riot. <HI>Sueno,</HI> with only ten other Per&s;ons e&s;caped and fled back to <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the Rejoicings the <HI>Scots</HI> made for this Victory, they were alarmed with an Account that a new Fleet of <HI>Danes</HI> was ar|rived at <HI>Kinghorne,</HI> &s;ent thither by <HI>Canute,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> to revenge the Defeat his Brother <HI>Sueno</HI> had received.</P>
<P>To re&s;i&s;t the&s;e Enemies, which were already landed, and bu&s;y in &s;poiling the Country, <HI>Macbeth</HI> and <HI>Banquo</HI> were &s;ent with a &s;ufficient Power, who encountering the <HI>Danes,</HI> &s;lew Part of them, and drove the re&s;t back to their Ships; tho&s;e who e&s;caped and got &s;afe aboard their Ve&s;&s;els, with large Sums of Money ob|tained Leave from <HI>Macbeth,</HI> that &s;uch of their Friends as were &s;lain in the la&s;t Fight might be buried at St. <HI>Colmes Inch.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;hort Time after, as <HI>Macbeth</HI> and <HI>Banquo</HI> were riding towards <HI>Fore&s;s,</HI> where the King then lay, pa&s;&s;ing through a Field without any Company, they were met &s;uddenly by three
<PB N="255" REF="266">
Women in &s;trange Apparel, re&s;embling Crea|tures of another World, and while they be|held them attentively, much wondering at their uncommon. Appearance, they approached <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and the fir&s;t &s;aid:</P>
<P>"All hail <HI>Macbeth,</HI> Thane of <HI>Glammis</HI>;" the &s;econd "Hail <HI>Macbeth</HI> Thane of <HI>Cawder,"</HI> and the third, "All hail <HI>Macbeth,</HI> who here|after &s;hall be King of <HI>Scotland."</HI></P>
<P>"What Manner of Women are ye, &s;aid <HI>Banquo,</HI> extremely &s;urprized, who &s;eem &s;o little favourable to me? to my Companion here you not only predict high Honours, but the Kingdom al&s;o, whereas to me you pro|mi&s;e nothing at all."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;aid &s;he, who had fir&s;t &s;poke, we promi&s;e &s;till greater Advantages to thee than him; he &s;hall reign indeed in his own Per&s;on, but his End &s;hall be unhappy; nor &s;hall he leave any I&s;&s;ue behind him to &s;ucceed to his Crown: As for thee, though thou &s;halt not be a King, yet thy De&s;cendants for long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Ages, &s;hall rule the Kingdom of <HI>Scot|land."</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the&s;e Words &s;poke than they all vani&s;hed out of Sight.</P>
<P>This Accident was thought at fir&s;t by <HI>Macbeth</HI> and <HI>Banquo,</HI> to be &s;ome Illu&s;ion of the Imagination, &s;o that <HI>Banquo</HI> would often je&s;t|ingly call <HI>Macbeth</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Macbeth</HI> in the &s;ame Manner call <HI>Banquo</HI> Fa|ther of many Kings; but afterwards it was the common Opinion, that the&s;e Women were either the Weird Si&s;ters, that is,
<PB N="256" REF="267">
Godde&s;&s;es of De&s;tiny, or el&s;e Nymphs or Fairies, who by Necromancy had obtained a Knowledge of future Events, becau&s;e every Thing they predicted came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Thane of <HI>Cawder</HI> being &s;hortly after condemned at <HI>Fori&s;s</HI> for high Trea&s;on, his Honours, E&s;tates, and Offices, were by the King be&s;towed on <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the Prophe&s;y being thus fulfilled, <HI>Macbeth</HI> revolving the re&s;t in his Mind, began to con&s;ider of the Means he &s;hould u&s;e to gain the Kingdom, but his fir&s;t Preferment coming unexpected and un&s;ought for, he determined to wait for the Interven|tion of Providence, to rai&s;e him to the Dig|nity his Wi&s;hes gra&s;ped at.</P>
<P>While he was thus expecting the Comple|tion of the Prophe&s;y, <HI>Duncan</HI> having two Sons by his Wife, who was Daughter to <HI>Seward</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> declared <HI>Malcolm,</HI> the elde&s;t, Prince of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> thereby appointing him his Succe&s;&s;or in the Kingdom immediately after his Decea&s;e.</P>
<P>It was provided by the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, that if the &s;ucceeding Prince was not of Age to take the Government up|on him&s;elf at his Predece&s;&s;or's Death, his next Kin&s;man &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth</HI> therefore &s;eeing his Hopes fru&s;trat|ed by this Di&s;po&s;ition of the King's, began to form Schemes for u&s;urping the Kingdom by Force, conceiving him&s;elf greatly injured
<PB N="257" REF="268">
by <HI>Duncan,</HI> who by thus rai&s;ing his Son, though in his Minority, to the Kingdom, took away all his future Claim to it.</P>
<P>The Words of the Weird Si&s;ters contri|buted al&s;o towards confirming him in his De|&s;ign of &s;eizing upon the Crown; and his Wife a haughty ambitious Woman, ardently de&s;irous of being a Queen, never cea&s;ed tor|menting him till &s;he had fixed him in his Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>At length, therefore, communicating his In|tentions to his mo&s;t tru&s;ty Friends, among whom <HI>Banquo</HI> was the Chief, in Confidence of their promi&s;ed Aid, he murdered the King at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> in the &s;ixth Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>Then being &s;urrounded with tho&s;e Per&s;ons on whom he mo&s;t depended, he cau&s;ed him|&s;elf to be proclaimed King, and went imme|diately to <HI>Scone,</HI> where by general Con&s;ent he received the Inve&s;titure of the Kingdom ac|cording to the accu&s;tomed Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> and <HI>Donald Bane,</HI> the two Sons of King <HI>Duncan,</HI> being apprehen|&s;ive that <HI>Macbeth</HI> would take away their Lives to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom, conveyed them&s;elves &s;ecretly out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malcolm</HI> fled into <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where he remained till Saint <HI>Edward,</HI> Son of King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> recovered the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> from the Power of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who received
<PB N="258" REF="269">
him into his Protection, and gave him an ho|nourable Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Donald Bane,</HI> his Brother, took Refuge in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was treated there with great Kindne&s;s by the King of that Land.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> after the Departure of the&s;e two Princes, endeavoured by great Liberalities to engage the Affection of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> to his Per&s;on, and when he found him&s;elf in peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom, he &s;et about reforming the Laws, rooting out all the Enormities and Abu&s;es which had crept into the Admini&s;tration, through the weak and &s;lothful Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Duncan.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o made many good Laws, and during the Space of ten Years governed the Realm with the utmo&s;t Prudence and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But this Appearance of Equity and Zeal for the public Good was all counterfeited, and only a&s;&s;umed to gain the Favour of the Peo|ple: Tyrants are always mi&s;tru&s;tful, they are in continual Fears that &s;ome other Per&s;on will rob them of their Power, by the &s;ame unju&s;t Means with which they acquired it.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> jealous of &s;ome Attempts again&s;t him, no longer di&s;&s;embled his Inclinations, but practi&s;ed and permitted all Sorts of Cruel|ties, the Words of the three Weird Si&s;ters were continually in his Thoughts.</P>
<P>They promi&s;ed him the Kingdom, and he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, but they promi&s;ed it al&s;o
<PB N="259" REF="270">
to the Po&s;terity of <HI>Banquo,</HI> and this Prediction might in like Manner be fulfilled.</P>
<P>To prevent it therefore, he determined to murder <HI>Banquo</HI> and his Son, and for this Pur|po&s;e he invited them to a Supper at the Palace; as they were returning home, &s;ome Murderers whom he had ordered to plant them&s;elves in the Road, &s;eized <HI>Banquo</HI> and killed him, but <HI>Fleance,</HI> favoured by the Darkne&s;s of the Night, e&s;caped and fled into <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>After the Murder of <HI>Banquo,</HI> Fortune &s;eemed to have for&s;aken <HI>Macbeth,</HI> none of his Undertakings pro&s;pered; every Man began to tremble for his own Life, and dur&s;t not ven|ture to appear before him; all Men were afraid of him, and he was afraid of all Men, &s;o that he continually &s;ought Occa&s;ion to put all tho&s;e Per&s;ons to Death of whom he had any Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>His Di&s;tru&s;t and Cruelty encrea&s;ing every Day, his Thir&s;t of Blood was never to be &s;a|tisfied; the forfeited E&s;tates of the Nobility whom he thus ma&s;&s;acred, enabled him to fill his Coffers, and maintain Forces to defend him again&s;t the Attempts of his Enemies.</P>
<P>For the greater Security of his Per&s;on, while he was thus exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t tyrannic Cruelty again&s;t his Subjects, he built a &s;trong Ca&s;tle upon the Top of a high Hill, called <HI>Dun&s;innane,</HI> &s;ituated in <HI>Gowry,</HI> ten Miles from <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="271">This Hill was of &s;uch a prodigious Height, that any Per&s;on &s;tanding upon the Top might almo&s;t behold all the Countries of <HI>Angus, Fife, Stermond,</HI> and <HI>Tweedale,</HI> lying as it were be|neath him.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle then being founded on the Top of this Hill, the Building of it put the King|dom to great Expence, becau&s;e the Materials could not be brought up without much Time and Labour.</P>
<P>But <HI>Macbeth</HI> being determined to compleat the Work &s;oon, commanded all the Thanes of every Shire throughout the Realm to come and do their Part towards the Building, every Man in his Turn.</P>
<P>At la&s;t it falling to the Turn of <HI>Macduffe,</HI> Thane of <HI>Fife,</HI> to build his Part, he &s;ent Workmen with all the nece&s;&s;ary Materials, and commanded them to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s with the utmo&s;t Diligence and Care, that no Occa&s;ion of Offence might be given to the King, which might make him re&s;ent his not coming in Per&s;on as the other Thanes did, for he well knew that <HI>Macbeth</HI> both feared and &s;u&s;pected him, for which Rea&s;on he re&s;olved to keep out of his Way.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth</HI> coming &s;oon after to &s;ee how the Work went on, was greatly enraged to find <HI>Macduffe</HI> was not there, and from that Time conceived an invincible Hatred again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Wizards, in whom he greatly confid|ed becau&s;e of the Completion of the two fir&s;t Prophe&s;ies, had warned him to take heed of
<PB N="261" REF="272">
<HI>Macduffe,</HI> who they told him was waiting for &s;ome Opportunity to de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>This Prediction would have determined him to put <HI>Macduffe</HI> immediately to Death, had not a Witch, who&s;e Predictions had al&s;o great Weight with him, a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould never be &s;lain by any Man who was born of Woman, nor overcome till <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood came to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dun&s;innane.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;oothing Prophe&s;ies bani&s;hed all Fear out of his Mind; he freely indulged the na|tural Cruelty of his Di&s;po&s;ition, mi&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ing his Subjects, and committing all Sorts of Outrages.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Macduffe,</HI> being in Fear for his own Life, took a Re&s;olution to fly into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> hoping to prevail with <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI> to claim the Crown of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> who in every Nobleman's Hou&s;e kept a dome&s;tic Spy in his Pay, was &s;oon in|formed of <HI>Macduffe</HI>'s Intention; he therefore came &s;uddenly with an Army into <HI>Fife,</HI> and be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle where <HI>Macduffe</HI> dwelt, ex|pecting to find him therein. The Gates were immediately &s;et open by the Servants, who mi&s;tru&s;ted no Danger; but <HI>Macbeth,</HI> enraged that <HI>Macduffe</HI> had e&s;caped him (he being al|ready fled to <HI>England)</HI> commanded his Wife and Children, together with all that were found in the Ca&s;tle, to be &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>Macduffe</HI> was &s;afe in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court when the News of this &s;hocking Cruelty was
<PB N="262" REF="273">
brought him; and adding to the De&s;ire of re|lieving his wretched Country the Hope of his own particular Revenge, he earne&s;tly entreat|ed Prince <HI>Malcolm</HI> to undertake the Recovery of his Right; he repre&s;ented to him in the mo&s;t moving Terms the deplorable Condition into which <HI>Scotland</HI> was brought, through the in|human Cruelties of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and that the People, dete&s;ting him for the Slaughters he had committed, as well on the Commons as Nobility, de&s;ired nothing more ardently than an Opportunity of &s;haking off their Yoke.</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm,</HI> who&s;e Soul was filled with Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the Mi&s;eries of his Countrymen, &s;ighed deeply while <HI>Macduffe</HI> was &s;peaking; which he perceiving, again renewed his In|treaties that he would attempt the Delivery of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him he would find it no dif|ficult Enterprize, con&s;idering the Legality of his Title to the Crown, and the earne&s;t De&s;ire of the People to have &s;ome Occa&s;ion given them to revenge them&s;elves on their hated Tyrant.</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm,</HI> though he was greatly affected with <HI>Macduffe</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, yet doubting whether he was not &s;ent by <HI>Macbeth</HI> to betray him, he determined to make Tryal of his Sin|cerity before he con&s;ented to his Propo&s;al, for which Purpo&s;e he &s;poke to him in this Man|ner.</P>
<P>"I am truly &s;orry, <HI>Macduffe,</HI> for the Mi&s;eries under which my unhappy Country has long
<PB N="263" REF="274">
groaned, but though my Inclination to relieve it were equal to your Wi&s;hes, yet on account of &s;ome incurable Vices which are rooted in my Di&s;po&s;ition, I am not fit to undertake &s;o great an Enterprize; for fir&s;t I am &s;o &s;wallow|ed up in immoderate Lu&s;t and Sen&s;uality, the abominable Springs of all other Vices, that if I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the regal Power, the Cha&s;tity of none of your Maids and Wives would be &s;afe; and &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Intempe|rance would be more in&s;upportable to you than the bloody Tyranny of <HI>Macbeth."</HI></P>
<P>"Intemperance, replied <HI>Macduffe,</HI> is cer|tainly a very great Fault, many noble Kings and Princes have lo&s;t both their Kingdoms and Lives by indulging them&s;elves in this Vice; neverthele&s;s there are Women enough in <HI>Scotland</HI> to &s;erve your Plea&s;ures; follow my Council therefore, and make your&s;elf King; I'll take upon my&s;elf the Care of gra|tifying this Pa&s;&s;ion for Women, in &s;o &s;ecret a Manner that your Reputation &s;hall not be hurt by it."</P>
<P>"But, replied <HI>Malcolm,</HI> I am al&s;o the mo&s;t avaritious Man in the World, and if I was King of <HI>Scotland</HI> I &s;hould put the greate&s;t Part of the Nobility to Death, that I might po&s;|&s;e&s;s my&s;elf of their E&s;tates."</P>
<P>"This Fault, &s;aid <HI>Macduffe,</HI> is much wor&s;e than the other, for Avarice is the Source of all Evil, a Crime for which mo&s;t of our Kings have been murdered, yet &s;till I mu&s;t
<PB N="264" REF="275">
continue to advi&s;e you to claim the Crown, there are Riches enough in <HI>Scotland</HI> to &s;atisfy your greedy De&s;ire."</P>
<P>"I am al&s;o, &s;aid <HI>Malcolm,</HI> &s;trongly inclined to Di&s;&s;imulation and every other Kind of De|ceit, and rejoice in nothing &s;o much as be|traying tho&s;e who put any Confidence in me; &s;ince there is not any Thing then more agreeable to the Character of a Prince, than Con&s;tancy, Truth and Ju&s;tice, and I am wholly abandoned to the contrary Vices, you &s;ee how unfit I am to reign; and therefore, &s;ince you have found the Means of extenuating all my other Faults, I pray you endeavour to cover them among the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"Di&s;&s;imulation, replied <HI>Macduffe,</HI> is indeed the wor&s;t of all, here then I leave thee:" "And oh! unhappy and mi&s;erable <HI>Scotchmen,</HI> added he, that are &s;courged with &s;o many un|avoidable Calamities! The wicked Tyrant who now without any Right or Title reigns over ye, oppre&s;&s;es ye with the mo&s;t bloody Cruelty; and this other, who has a lawful Claim to the Crown, is &s;o replete with all the &s;hameful Vices of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he is un|worthy to enjoy it; for, by his own Confe&s;|&s;ion, he is not only avaritious to the la&s;t De|gree, but wholly abandoned to the mo&s;t in&s;a|tiable Lu&s;t, and is withal &s;o fal&s;e a Traitor that no Credit can be given to any Thing he &s;ays: Farewell then <HI>Scotland</HI> for ever; I now look upon my&s;elf as a bani&s;hed Man, without any Hope of Comfort or Relief." Saying this he wept bitterly.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="276"><HI>Malcolm</HI> ob&s;erving he was about to depart, took him by the Hand, and &s;aid, "Be comforted <HI>Macduff,</HI> for I have none of the&s;e Vices you la|ment: I have je&s;ted with you in this Manner only to try your Sincerity; for many Times hath <HI>Macbeth</HI> &s;ought by the&s;e Means to get me into his Hands, but the more backward I have &s;hewn my&s;elf to agree to your Reque&s;t, the more Diligence &s;hall I u&s;e in accompli&s;hing it: Hereupon they embraced, promi&s;ing to be faithful to each other's Intere&s;t, and then con|&s;ulted together how they might be&s;t put their Enterprize in Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Macduff</HI> &s;oon after repairing to the Borders or <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ecretly di&s;patched Letters to the Nobles of the Realm, in which he declared, that <HI>Malcolm</HI> intended to come &s;uddenly into <HI>Scotland</HI> and claim the Crown; and therefore required them, &s;ince that Prince was the true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all their Power to recover it out of the Hands of the U&s;urper.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Malcolm</HI> &s;o far engaged the Favour of King <HI>Edward,</HI> that old <HI>Seyward,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with ten thou&s;and Men, was appointed to go with him into <HI>Scot|land</HI> to &s;upport him in his Preten&s;ions on that Crown.</P>
<P>When the News of this intended Inva&s;ion was &s;pread abroad in <HI>Scotland</HI> the Nobles formed them&s;elves into two different Parties,
<PB N="266" REF="277">
the one taking Part with <HI>Macbeth,</HI> the other with <HI>Malcolm.</HI></P>
<P>Between the&s;e two Factions there frequent|ly happened light Skirmi&s;hes; but tho&s;e that were of <HI>Malcolm</HI>'s Side would not ri&s;k the Danger of engaging in a pitched Battle till they were joined by <HI>Malcolm,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces under the Command of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> therefore, not thinking him&s;elf able to engage the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> retired into <HI>Fife,</HI> and fortifying a Camp near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dun|&s;inane,</HI> determined not to hazard a Battle un|le&s;s his Enemies pur&s;ued him thither.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome of his Friends advi&s;ed him either to make a Treaty with <HI>Malcolm,</HI> or el&s;e to fly immediately into the I&s;les, and take his Trea&s;ure with him, to the End that he might be able to engage &s;everal of the great Princes of the Realm in his Intere&s;t, and re|tain Strangers in his Pay, in whom he might better confide than in his own Subjects, who were every Day abandoning him.</P>
<P>But he had &s;o firm a Reliance on his Pro|phecies, that he believed he &s;hould never be vanqui&s;hed till <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood came to <HI>Dun&s;i|nane,</HI> nor be &s;lain by any Man that was born of a Woman.</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm,</HI> who had ha&s;tily pur&s;ued <HI>Macbeth,</HI> came the Night before the Battle to <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood, and when his Army had re&s;ted there awhile, he commanded every Man to cut down a Branch of a Tree and march with it in his Hand, that thus &s;haded, they might come
<PB N="267" REF="278">
clo&s;ely, without di&s;covering their Numbers, within View of their Enemies.</P>
<P>The next Day, when <HI>Macbeth</HI> beheld them he was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, and the Prophecy that had been delivered to him long before coming into his Mind, he doubted not but that it was now fulfilled, &s;ince he &s;aw <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood coming to <HI>Dun&s;inane</HI>; neverthele&s;s he drew up his Men in Order of Battle, exhorting them to fight valiantly.</P>
<P>His Enemies, however, had &s;carcely ca&s;t away their Boughs, when <HI>Macbeth,</HI> perceiving their Numbers, betook him&s;elf to Flight.</P>
<P><HI>Macduff,</HI> &s;timulated with Hatred and an eager Thir&s;t of Revenge, never cea&s;ed pur|&s;uing him till he came up with him at <HI>Lunfan|nain,</HI> and <HI>Macbeth</HI> &s;eeing him clo&s;e at his Heels leaped off his Hor&s;e, crying aloud, "Thou Traitor, why do&s;t thou thus follow me in vain; &s;ince I am not appointed to be &s;lain by any Man that is born of a Woman? But come on then, and receive the Reward thou ha&s;t merited for thy Folly." Hereupon he aimed a Blow at him with his Sword, thinking to have killed him; but <HI>Macduff</HI> &s;uddenly leaping off his Hor&s;e, avoided the Stroke, and holding his naked Sword in his Hand thus an&s;wered:</P>
<P>"It is true, <HI>Macbeth</HI>; and now &s;halt thy in&s;atiable Cruelty have an End; for I, I am he whom thy Wizards have told thee of, not born of my Mother, but ripped out of her Womb;" then &s;uddenly clo&s;ing with him, he
<PB N="268" REF="279">
&s;lew him on the Place, and cutting off his Head from his Shoulders, fixed it upon a Poll, and brought it to <HI>Malcolm.</HI></P>
<P>This was the End of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> after he had reigned over <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;eventeen Years: In the Beginning of his Reign he performed many worthy Actions, and made many Laws very u&s;eful to the Commonwealth; but afterwards, thro' the Illu&s;ion of the Devil, he obliterated the Glory of his good Deeds by the mo&s;t dete&s;table Cruelty.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Plan of <HI>MACBETH.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MACBETH,</HI> a near Kin&s;man of <HI>Dun|can,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> having in one Day quelled a Rebellion, and given a total De|feat to the Army of the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who invaded <HI>Scotland,</HI> as he was returning to Court with his Friend <HI>Banquo</HI> meets three Witches on a barren Heath, the fir&s;t of whom hails him Thane of <HI>Glamis,</HI> the &s;econd Thane of <HI>Cawdor,</HI> and the Third with the Title of King hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Banquo,</HI> offended at their addre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves only to his Friend, de&s;ires them to &s;peak likewi&s;e to him, upon which they prophe&s;y that he &s;hall be happier than <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and though he &s;hall not &s;way a Scepter him&s;elf, yet his De&s;cendants &s;hall be Kings; this &s;aid they vani&s;hed immediately.</P>
<P>While <HI>Macbeth</HI> and <HI>Banquo</HI> are expre&s;|&s;ing their Surprize to each other at this Pro|digy,
<PB N="270" REF="281">
&s;ome Noblemen &s;ent by the King &s;alute <HI>Macbeth</HI> with the Title of Thane of <HI>Cawdor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> a&s;toni&s;hed at the Completion of this fir&s;t Prophecy, entertains a De&s;ign of mur|dering the King to make Way for the fulfilling of the &s;econd, and artfully &s;ounds the Inclina|tions of <HI>Banquo,</HI> but finding him fixed in his Loyalty to the King, he forbears to tamper with him.</P>
<P>The King declaring his Intentions to be&s;tow the Title of Prince of <HI>Cumberland</HI> on his elde&s;t Son <HI>Malcolm, Macbeth</HI> alarmed at this, re&s;olves to be &s;udden in the Execution of his De&s;igns, and by a Letter acquaints his Wife with the Prophecies of the Witches, one of which he tells her had been already accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Macbeth,</HI> a proud, ambitious, and cruel Woman, urges on her Hu&s;band to the Murder of the King, and accordingly <HI>Duncan</HI> coming to lodge one Night at <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Ca&s;tle in <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> he is &s;tabbed in his Bed by <HI>Mac|beth.</HI> The two Sons of <HI>Duncan</HI> fearing the &s;ame Fate fly from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Macbeth</HI> u&s;urps the Crown.</P>
<P>Some time after being jealous of the promi&s;ed Sovereignty to <HI>Banquo</HI>'s Children, he cau&s;es <HI>Banquo</HI> to be murdered, but his Son <HI>Fleance,</HI> whom he ordered likewi&s;e to be di&s;patched, e&s;capes out of the Hands of the Murderers and &s;aves him&s;elf by Flight.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="282"><HI>Macbeth,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed by unea&s;y Doubts about his own Security, goes to the three Witches who had predicted his Greatne&s;s, to have them re&s;olved; they rai&s;e Apparitions who bid him beware of <HI>Macduff,</HI> the Thane of <HI>Fife</HI>; but at the &s;ame Time a&s;&s;ure him that none of Woman born &s;hould have Power to hurt him, and that he &s;hould never be vanqui&s;hed till <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood came to the Hill of <HI>Dun&s;i|nane.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> elated with the&s;e Promi&s;es, &s;ets no Bound is to his Cruelty, and re&s;olves to murder <HI>Macduff</HI>; but being told he is fled to <HI>England,</HI> he &s;eizes upon his Ca&s;tle at <HI>Fife,</HI> and puts his Wife, his Children, and all that were found within it to the Sword.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Malcolm,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of King <HI>Duncan,</HI> having prevailed upon the King of <HI>England,</HI> with whom he had taken Refuge, to furni&s;h him with an Army, marches into <HI>Scotland</HI> accompanied by <HI>Macduff</HI> who breathes nothing but Revenge again&s;t the Ty|rant that had deprived him of his Wife and Children.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth</HI> hearing of their Approach, and being daily informed of the De&s;ertion of his Officers and Soldiers, fortifies the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dun&s;inane,</HI> and confiding in the Promi&s;es of the Spirits prepares to fight.</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm,</HI> when he comes into <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood with his Army, commands every Man to cut him down a Bough and carry it before him in
<PB N="272" REF="283">
order to conceal their Numbers from the Ene|my; a Centinel of <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s &s;urprized at this &s;trange Appearance, informs him that as he was looking towards <HI>Birnam,</HI> on a &s;udden he perceived the Wood to move.</P>
<P>Macbeth grows furious at this Account, but &s;till relying on the Promi&s;e of the la&s;t Spirit, "that he &s;hould not be hurt by one of Woman born," he goes into the Field, and being met by <HI>Macduff,</HI> who in An&s;wer to his Boa&s;ts of bearing a charmed Life, tells him "he was not born of his Mother, but ripped from her Womb;" he de&s;pairs, cur&s;es, and being forced to fight, is killed by <HI>Macduff</HI>: The Conqueror cuts off his Head and carries it to <HI>Malcolm,</HI> who&s;e Troops having gained a compleat Vic|tory, he is proclaimed King of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Macbeth,</HI> tormented with horrible Imaginations, deprives her&s;elf of Life before the deci&s;ive Battle is fought, in which <HI>Mac|beth</HI> is &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has pretty exactly followed the Thread of the Hi&s;tory in this Play, which takes in Part of the Life of <HI>Duncan</HI> and the whole Reign of <HI>Macbeth</HI>: Some few Varia|tions he has made for the Sake of diver&s;ifying his Characters and contracting the Action; as when he &s;hews <HI>Banquo</HI> un&s;haken in his Loyalty to his King; though the Hi&s;torians &s;ay he joined with <HI>Macbeth</HI> in his Con&s;piracy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the murder of <HI>Duncan,</HI> and making <HI>Macbeth</HI> defeat the Rebels and &s;ubdue the King of <HI>Norway</HI> in one Day; when, accord|ing to the Hi&s;torian there was a long Interval
<PB N="273" REF="284">
of Time between the&s;e two Actions, in which &s;everal other Battles were fought.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> fol|lowed <HI>Holling&s;hed</HI> in the Facts which compo&s;e this Play, as well as in many of his other hi&s;torical Plays. In the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> where he found <HI>Holling&s;hed</HI>'s Chronicle defi|cient, he probably con&s;ulted <HI>Bellendon,</HI> who tran&s;lated <HI>Boetius</HI> in 1541.</P>
<P>"The Incongruity of all the Pa&s;&s;ages in which the Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> is mentioned (&s;ays the celebrated Author of the <HI>Rambler</HI> in a Pam|phlet intitled, <HI>Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations on the Tragedy of</HI> Macbeth) is very remarkable; in the &s;econd Scene the Thanes of <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>An|gus</HI> bring the King an Account of the Battle, and inform him that <HI>Norway</HI>
<Q><L>A&s;&s;i&s;ted by that mo&s;t di&s;loyal Traitor</L>
<L>The Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> 'gan a di&s;mal Con|flict.</L></Q></P>
<P>"It appears that <HI>Cawdor</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner, for the King &s;ays in the &s;ame Scene,
<Q><L>Go, pronounce his Death,</L>
<L>And with his former Title greet <HI>Macbeth.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"Yet, though <HI>Cawdor</HI> was thus taken by <HI>Macbeth</HI> in Arms again&s;t the King, when <HI>Macbeth</HI> is &s;aluted in the fourth Scene Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> by the Weird Si&s;ters, he a&s;ks,
<Q><PB N="274" REF="285">
<L>How of <HI>Cawdor?</HI> The Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> lives;</L>
<L>A pro&s;perous Gentleman.</L></Q>
"And in the next Line con&s;iders the Promi&s;es that he &s;hould be <HI>Cawdor</HI> and King as equal|ly unlikely to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>"How can <HI>Macbeth</HI> be ignorant of the State of the Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> whom he has ju&s;t defeated and taken Pri&s;oner, or call him a <HI>pro&s;perous Gentleman,</HI> who has forfeited his Title and Life by open Rebellion? Or why &s;hould he wonder that the Title of the Rebel whom he has overthrown &s;hould be conferred upon him?</P>
<P>"He cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;&s;emble his Knowledge of the Condition of <HI>Cawdor,</HI> be|cau&s;e he enquires with all the Ardour of Cu|rio&s;ity and the Vehemence of &s;udden A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and becau&s;e nobody is pre&s;ent but <HI>Ban|quo,</HI> who had an equal Part of the Battle and was equally acquainted with <HI>Cawdor</HI>'s Trea|&s;on.</P>
<P>"However, in the next Scene his Ignorance &s;till continues, and, when <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Angus</HI> pre&s;ent him from the King with his new Title, he cries out,
<Q><L>The Thane of <HI>Cawdor</HI> lives:</L>
<L>Why do you dre&s;s me in his borrow'd Robes?</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="286">"Ro&s;&s;e and <HI>Angus</HI> who were the Me&s;&s;en|gers that in the &s;econd Scene informed the King of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance given by <HI>Cawdor</HI> to the Invader, having lo&s;t, as well as <HI>Mac|beth,</HI> all Memory of what they had &s;o lately &s;een and related, make this An&s;wer;

"Neither <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> knew what he had ju&s;t reported, nor <HI>Macbeth</HI> what he had ju&s;t done.</P>
<P>"This &s;eems not to be one of the Faults that are to be imputed to the Tran&s;cribers; &s;ince, though the Incon&s;i&s;tency of <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Angus</HI> might be removed by &s;uppo&s;ing that their Names are erroneou&s;ly in&s;erted, and that only <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> brought the Account of the Battle, and only <HI>Angus</HI> was &s;ent to compliment <HI>Mac|beth,</HI> yet the Forgetfulne&s;s of <HI>Macbeth</HI> cannot be palliated, &s;ince what he &s;ays could not be &s;poken by any other.</P>
<P><HI>"Shake&s;pear,</HI> by deviating from Hi&s;tory in making <HI>Banquo</HI> loyal and virtuous, had not on|ly in View the contra&s;ting his Character with <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s, but al&s;o a Compliment to King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, in who&s;e Reign this Play was written, and was lineally de&s;cended from <HI>Banquo.</HI></P>

<P>"Yet it is to be wi&s;hed that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had made U&s;e of the prophe&s;ying Witches to hint at the Means by which this Change in the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion was to be made. Thus it is related in <HI>Boetius."</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Fleance,</HI> after the Murder of his Father, being protected by the Darkne&s;s of the Night, and having for &s;ome Time concealed him&s;elf in <HI>Scotland,</HI> e&s;caped into <HI>Wales,</HI> where the Strength of his Judgment and Affability of his Temper recommended him very &s;oon after his Arrival to the Protection and Favour of the Prince of that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="288">"Pro&s;perity rai&s;ed his Ambition to an unpar|donable Height: he abu&s;ed the Confidence re|po&s;ed in him by &s;ecretly paying unlawful Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the young Prince&s;s, the Daughter of his Benefactor: Tho&s;e: Addre&s;&s;es proved &s;ucce&s;s|ful; her Father di&s;covered her Pregnancy, and that <HI>Fleance</HI> was her Paramour; <HI>Fleance</HI> was put to Death; and the Lady as &s;oon as &s;he was delivered of her Child, which proved to be a Son, and was named <HI>Walter,</HI> was condemned to pa&s;s the re&s;t of her Life in the Character of a mean Dome&s;tic. Young <HI>Walter,</HI> by Order of his enraged Grandfather, was &s;ent to a re|mote Part of <HI>Wales</HI> to be educated as a Ru&s;|tic.</P>
<P>"When he had attained his twentieth Year, the Blood which flowed in his Veins in&s;pired him with Sentiments far nobler and more re|fined than tho&s;e of his u&s;ual Companions; he left the Country and threw him&s;elf boldly into the Protection of his Grandfather at Court. This noble Re&s;olution was not entirely un&s;uc|ce&s;sful; he was admitted to &s;tay in the Palace, but in a mean and &s;ervile Station.</P>
<P>"One of the Courtiers with whom he had quarrelled, reproached him with the Illegiti|macy of his Birth; <HI>Walter</HI> was tran&s;ported with Fury at the Affront, and &s;lew the Per&s;on who offered it to him.</P>
<P>"He was too &s;en&s;ible of his Grandfather's Severity to venture the Effects of it on this Occa&s;ion, he fled immediately to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and implored Protection from his Relations there.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="289">"He met with a favourable Reception from them, and was particularly honoured and e&s;teemed by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Noblemen who were at that Time in the Court of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon an Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Margaret,</HI> who was then Queen of that Nation.</P>
<P>"He became afterwards General for that Prince&s;s in <HI>Galloway</HI> and the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;lands</HI>; and having gained a compleat Victory over the Rebels of tho&s;e Parts was made High Se|ne&s;chall of the Kingdom, and Lord of &s;everal noble Manors, among which was that of <HI>Stuart</HI>'s-<HI>I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>"He left at his Death a Son, named <HI>Allan Stuart,</HI> who &s;ignalized his Valour on many Occa&s;ions again&s;t the <HI>Saracens</HI> in the <HI>Holy Land. Alexander</HI> his Son &s;ucceeded him, and was Founder of <HI>Pai&s;ley-Abbey. Alexander</HI> was followed by his Son <HI>Walter,</HI> &s;urnamed of <HI>Dundonald,</HI> a famous General under <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third. <HI>Walter</HI> had two Sons, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> who married the Daughter of <HI>Ro|bert</HI> of <HI>Cruxtoun,</HI> from which Marriage the Families of <HI>Darnley</HI> and <HI>Lennox</HI> are de&s;cended.</P>

<P><PB N="279" REF="290">This long Account of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Banquo</HI> will I hope not &s;eem unentertaining to the Admirers of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who will thereby &s;ee with what Judgment that great Poet has deviated from Hi&s;tory in giving Loyalty and Virtue to the Character of this Father of many Kings.</P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Macbeth</HI> is drawn after the Hi&s;torians, yet <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has &s;often|ed a little &s;ome of the mo&s;t rugged Features; he &s;hews him doubtful and irre&s;olute about the Murder of the King, &s;purred on by Ambition to commit it, but re&s;trained by his Abhorrence of the Action, and when by the In&s;tigations of his Wife he is prevailed upon to do it, his Mind is afterwards filled with Remor&s;e, and all the unea&s;y Sen&s;ations that attend repentant Guilt.</P>
<P>The Character <HI>Macbeth</HI> gives of <HI>Duncan</HI> in the Play is not incon&s;i&s;tent with that in the Hi&s;tory, yet it is not the &s;ame; <HI>Macbeth</HI> &s;peaks only of his Virtues, and his Faults were tho&s;e Virtues carried to Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The In&s;tigation u&s;ed by Lady <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and the Fire of his Temper are touched upon by <HI>Boetius,</HI> but improved by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with all the Force of Words and Propriety of Charac|ter.</P>
<P>The Wife of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Boetius,</HI> in|&s;pired him with Ambition to the utmo&s;t of her Power; &s;he was ardently de&s;irous of the royal Title, and was wicked and bold enough to
<PB N="280" REF="291">
undertake any Enterprize, and was impetuous in the Pro&s;ecution of it.</P>
<P>She prompted <HI>Macbeth</HI> to the Murder of the King by the mo&s;t provoking Expre&s;&s;ions, re|proaching him with Cowardice and Sloth, as negligent to receive what Fate had directed to obtain.</P>
<P>That the Glory of Reigning had in&s;pired many Men to pur&s;ue the empty Name of King without the actual Power, even at the Expence of their Lives.</P>
<P>The machinary Part of this Play is &s;o beau|tifully defended and illu&s;trated by the ingenious Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> in the above-mentioned Pamph|let, that I think I cannot confer a greater Ob|ligation on the Reader than by tran&s;cribing tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages here.</P>
<P>"In order to make a true E&s;timate of the Abilities and Merit of a Writer, it is always nece&s;&s;ary to examine the Genius of his Age, and the Opinions of his Contemporaries."</P>
<P>"A Poet who &s;hould now make the whole Action of his Tragedy depend upon Enchant|ment, and produce the chief Events by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;upernatural Agents, would be cen&s;ured as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Bounds of Pro|bability; he would be bani&s;hed from the Theatre to the Nur&s;ery, and condemned to write Fairy Tales in&s;tead of Tragedies."</P>
<P>"But a Survey of the Notions that pre|vailed at the Time when this Play was written,
<PB N="281" REF="292">
will prove that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was in no Danger of &s;uch Cen&s;ures, &s;ince he only turned the Sy&s;tem that was then univer&s;ally admitted, to his Advantage, and was far from overburthen|ing the Credulity of his Audience."</P>
<P>"The Reality of Witchcraft or Enchant|ment, which though not &s;trictly the &s;ame, are confounded in this Play, has in all Ages and Countries been credited by the common Peo|ple, and in mo&s;t by the Learned them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"The&s;e Phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently in Proportion, as the Dark|ne&s;s of Ignorance has been more gro&s;s; but it cannot be &s;hewn, that the brighte&s;t Gleams of Knowledge have at any Time been &s;uffici|ent to drive them out of the World."</P>
<P>"The Time in which this Kind of Cre|dulity was at its Height, &s;eems to have been that of the Holy War, in which the Chri&s;|tians imputed all their Defeats to Enchant|ments or diabolical Oppo&s;ition, as they a&s;|cribed their Succe&s;s to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Military Saints. And the learned Mr. W &mdash; appears to believe (Supplement to the Introduction to <HI>Don Quixote</HI>) that the fir&s;t Accounts of Enchantments were brought into this Part of the World by tho&s;e who re|turned from their Ea&s;tern Expeditions."</P>
<P>"But there is always &s;ome Di&s;tance be|tween the Birth and Maturity of Folly as of Wickedne&s;s: This Opinion had long exi&s;t|ed, though perhaps the Application of it had
<PB N="282" REF="293">
in no foregoing Age been &s;o frequent, nor the Reception &s;o general.</P>
<P><HI>Olympiodorus,</HI> in <HI>Photius</HI>'s Extracts, tells us of one <HI>Libanius,</HI> who practi&s;ed this Kind of military Magic, and having promi&s;ed to per|form great Things again&s;t the <HI>Barbarians</HI> without Soldiers, was at the In&s;tances of the Empre&s;s <HI>Placidia</HI> put to Death, when he was about to have given Proofs of his Abilities. The Empre&s;s &s;hewed &s;ome Kindne&s;s in her Anger, by cutting him off at a Time &s;o con|venient to his Reputation.</P>
<P>"But a more remarkable Proof of the An|tiquity of this Notion may be found in St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI>'s Book <HI>de Sacerdotis,</HI> which exhi|bits a Scene of Enchantments not exceeded by any Romance of the middle Age; he &s;up|po&s;es a Spectator overlooking a Field of Bat|tle, attended by one that points out all the va|rious Objects of Horror, the Engines of De&s;|truction, and the Arts of Slaughter. Let him then proceed to &s;hew him in the oppo&s;ite Ar|mies, Hor&s;es flying by Enchantment, armed Men tran&s;ported through the Air, and every Power and Form of Magic.</P>
<P>"Whether St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> believed that &s;uch Performances were really to be &s;een in a Day of Battle, or only endeavoured to inliven his De&s;cription, by adopting the Notions of the Vulgar, it is equally certain that &s;uch No|tions were in his Time received, and that therefore they were not imported from the <HI>Saracens</HI> in a later Age; the Wars with the
<PB N="283" REF="294">
<HI>Saracens</HI> however gave Occa&s;ion to their Pro|pagation, not only as Bigotry naturally di&s;|covers Prodigies, but as the Scene of Action was removed to a great Di&s;tance, and Di&s;|tance either of Time or Place is &s;ufficient to reconcile weak Minds to wonderful Rela|tions.</P>
<P>"The Reformation did not immediately arrive at its Meridian, and though the Day gradually encrea&s;ed upon us, the Goblins of Witchcraft &s;till continued to hover in the Twilight. In the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was the remarkable Trial of the Witches of <HI>Warbois,</HI> who&s;e Conviction is &s;till commemo|rated in an annual Sermon at <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> But in the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> in which this Tragedy was written, many Circum&s;tan|ces concurred to propagate and confirm this Opinion.</P>
<P>"The King, who was much celebrated for his Knowledge, had before his Arrival in <HI>England</HI> not only examined in Per&s;on a Woman accu&s;ed of Witchcraft, but had given a very formal Account of the Practices and Illu&s;ions of evil Spirits, the Compacts of Witches, the Ceremonies u&s;ed by them, the Manner of detecting them, and the Ju&s;tice of puni&s;hing them, in his Dialogues of <HI>Daemonologie,</HI> written in the Scotti&s;h Dialect, and publi&s;hed at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>"This Book was &s;oon after his Acce&s;&s;ion, reprinted at <HI>London,</HI> and as the ready Way to
<PB N="284" REF="295">
gain King <HI>James</HI>'s Favour was to flatter his Speculations, the Sy&s;tem of <HI>Daemonologie</HI> was immediately adopted by all who de&s;ired either to gain Preferment or not to lo&s;e it."</P>
<P>"Thus the Doctrine of Witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated, and as the greate&s;t Part of Mankind have no other Rea&s;on for their Opinions than that they are in Fa&s;hion, it cannot be doubted but this Per&s;ua&s;ion made a rapid Progre&s;s, &s;ince Vanity and Credulity co-operated in it's Favour, and it had a Ten|dency to free Cowardice from Reproach."</P>
<P>"The Infection &s;oon reached the Parlia|ment, who, in the fir&s;t Year of King <HI>James,</HI> made a Law, by which it was enacted, <HI>Ch.</HI> 12. That if any Per&s;on &s;hall u&s;e any Invocati|on or Conjuration of any evil or wicked Spirit. 2.

Or &s;hall u&s;e, practi&s;e, or exerci&s;e any Sort of Witch|craft, Sorcery, Charm, or Enchantment. 5. Whereby any Per&s;on &s;hall be de&s;troyed, killed, wa&s;ted, con&s;umed, pined, or lamed in any Part of the Body. 6. That every &s;uch Per&s;on being convicted &s;hall &s;uffer Death."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="296">"Thus in the Time of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was the Doctrine of Witchcraft at once e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Law and by the Fa&s;hion, and it became not only unpolite, but criminal to doubt it, and as Prodigies are always &s;een in Proportion as they are expected, Witches were every Day di&s;covered, and multiplied &s;o fa&s;t in &s;ome Places, that Bi&s;hop <HI>Hall</HI> mentions a Village in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where their Number was greater than that of the Hou&s;es."</P>
<P>"The Je&s;uits and Sectaries took Advantage of this univer&s;al Error, and endeavoured to promote the Intere&s;t of their Parties by pre|tended Cures of Per&s;ons afflicted by evil Spi|rits, but they were detected and expo&s;ed by the Clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church."</P>
<P>"Upon this general Infatuation <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> might be ea&s;ily allowed to found a Play, e&s;pe|cially &s;ince he has followed with great Exact|ne&s;s &s;uch Hi&s;tories as were then thought true; nor can it be doubted that the Scenes of En|chantment, however they may now be re|diculed, were both by him&s;elf and his Audi|ence thought awful and affecting."</P>
<P>The Note on the fir&s;t Scene of the fourth Act explains the Nature of the Incantations and diabolical Ceremonies made U&s;e of by the Witches, I &s;hall therefore give the Reader the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it here."</P>
<P>"As this is the chief Scene of Enchant|ment in the Play, it is proper in this Place to ob&s;erve with how much Judgment <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="297">
has &s;elected all the Circum&s;tances of his in|fernal Ceremonies, and how exactly he has conformed to common Opinions and Tradi|tions."</P>
<Q>Thrice the brinded Cat hath mewed.</Q>
<P>"The u&s;ual Form in which familiar Spirits are reported to conver&s;e with Witches is that of a Cat. A Witch, who was tried about half a Century before the Time of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> had a Cat, named <HI>Rutterkin,</HI> as the Spirit of one of tho&s;e Witches was <HI>Grimalkin,</HI> and when any Mi&s;chief was to be done &s;he u&s;ed to bid <HI>Rotterkin</HI> go and fly; but once when &s;he would have &s;ent <HI>Rutterkin</HI> to torment a Daughter of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Rutland,</HI> in|&s;tead of going or flying &s;he only cried <HI>Mew,</HI> from which &s;he di&s;covered that the Lady was out of his Power, the Power of Witches be|ing not univer&s;al, but limited as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has taken Care to inculcate."</P>
<Q><L>Though his Bark cannot be lo&s;t,</L>
<L>Yet it &s;hall be Tempe&s;t to&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>"The common Afflictions which the Malice of Witches produced was Melancholy, Fits, and Lo&s;s of Fle&s;h, which are threatened by one of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Witches."</P>
<Q><L>Weary Sev'nnights nine Times nine</L>
<L>Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="287" REF="298">"It was likewi&s;e their Practice to de&s;troy the Cattle of their Neighbours, and the Far|mers have to this Day many Ceremonies to &s;ecure their Cows and other Cattle from Witchcraft; but they &s;eem to have been mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected of Malice again&s;t Swine."</P>
<P><HI>"Shake&s;pear</HI> has accordingly made one of his Witches declare that &s;he has been <HI>killing Swine,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Har&s;enet</HI> ob&s;erves, that about that Time a Sow could not be ill of the Mea&s;les, nor a Girl of the Sullens, but &s;ome old Woman was charged with Witchcraft."</P>

<L>Boil thou fir&s;t i' th' charmed Pot.</L></Q>
<P>"Toads have likewi&s;e long lain under the Reproach of being by &s;ome Means acce&s;&s;ary to Witchcraft, for which Rea&s;on <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in the fir&s;t Scene of this Play calls one of the Spirits <HI>Padocke,</HI> or <HI>Toad,</HI> and now takes Care to put a Toad fir&s;t into the Pot."</P>
<P>"When <HI>Varinus</HI> was &s;eized at <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> there was found at his Lodgings <HI>ingens Bufo Vitro inclu&s;us,</HI> a great Toad &s;hut in a Phial, upon which tho&s;e who pro&s;ecuted him, <HI>Vin&eacute;|ficium exprobabant,</HI> charged him I &s;uppo&s;e with Witchcraft."</P>

<Q><L>Finger of birth-&s;trangled Babe,</L>
<L>Ditch-deliver'd by a Drab.</L></Q>
<P>"It has been already mentioned in the Law again&s;t Witches, that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to take up dead Bodies to u&s;e in Enchantments, which was confe&s;&s;ed by the Woman whom King <HI>James</HI> examined, and who had of a dead Body that was divided in one of their A&s;&s;em|blies, two Fingers for her Share."</P>
<P>"It is ob&s;ervable that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> on this great Occa&s;ion, which involves the Fate of a King, multiplies all the Circum&s;tances of Horror."</P>
<P>"The Babe, who&s;e Finger is u&s;ed, mu&s;t be &s;trangled in its Birth; the Grea&s;e mu&s;t not be human, but mu&s;t have dropped from a Gibbet, the Gibbet of a Murderer, and even the Sow who&s;e Blood is u&s;ed, mu&s;t have of|fended Nature by devouring her own Farrow. The&s;e are Touches of Judgment and Genius."</P>
<Q><L>And now about the Cauldron &s;ing,</L>
<L>Blue Spirits and white,</L>
<L>Black Spirits and grey,</L>
<L>Mingle, mingle, mingle,</L>
<L>You that mingle may,</L>

<L>Thus do go about, about</L>
<L>Thrice to mine, and thrice to thine,</L>
<L>And thrice again to make up nine.</L></Q>
<P>"The&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages I have brought to|gether, becau&s;e they both &s;eem &s;ubject to the Objection of too much Levity for the Solem|nity of Enchantment, and may both be &s;hewn by one Quotation from <HI>Camden</HI>'s Account of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be founded upon a Practice really ob&s;erved by the uncivilized Natives of that Country.</P>
<P>"When any one gets a Fall, &s;ays the In|former of <HI>Camden,</HI> he &s;tarts up, and turning three Times to the Right, digs a Hole in the Earth; for they imagine that there is a Spirit in the Ground; and if he falls &s;ick in two or three Days, they &s;end one of their Women that is &s;killed in that Way to the Place, where he &s;ays, I call thee from the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South, from the Groves, the Woods, the Rivers and the Fens, from the Fairies, Red, Black, and White.</P>
<P>"There was likewi&s;e a Book written before the Time of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> de&s;cribing among other Properties the Colours of Spirits."</P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI> in his critical Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has di&s;|covered a Beauty that has e&s;caped all his other Commentators: "The Apparitions, he &s;ays, who are introduced paltering with <HI>Macbeth</HI> in
<PB N="290" REF="301">
a double Sen&s;e, and leading him on according to the common Notions of diabolical Oracles to his Confu&s;ion, are them&s;elves &s;ymbolical Repre&s;entations of what &s;hall happen to him.</P>
<P>"The armed Head who bids him beware of <HI>Macduff,</HI> repre&s;ents &s;ymbolically <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Head cut off, and brought to <HI>Malcolm</HI> by <HI>Macduff.</HI> The bloody Child, who a&s;&s;ures him that none of Woman born &s;hould have Power to hurt him, is <HI>Macduff</HI> untimely rip|ped from his Mother's Womb. And the Child with a Crown on his Head and a Bough in his Hand, who tells him he &s;hall never be vanqui&s;hed till <HI>Bernam</HI> Wood comes to <HI>Dun|&s;inane,</HI> is the royal <HI>Malcolm,</HI> who ordered his Soldiers to hew them down a Bough, and bear it before them till they come to <HI>Dun&s;i|nane."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;eems to have committed a great Over&s;ight, in making <HI>Macbeth,</HI> after he found him&s;elf deceived in the Prophecy relating to <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood, &s;o ab&s;olutely rely upon the other, which he had good Rea&s;on to fear might be equally fallacious. When the Me&s;|&s;enger tells him he &s;aw <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood begin to move, and that it was coming towards <HI>Dun|&s;inane,</HI> he falls into a Tran&s;port of Grief and De&s;pair, and owns he doubts the Equivocation of the Fiend, yet carries his Reflexions no farther than the pre&s;ent Ci&s;cum&s;tance. Though it might naturally be expected from the Con|viction of the Fal&s;ehood of one Prophecy, upon which he had built &s;uch &s;olid Hopes, that the
<PB N="291" REF="302">
Truth of another, which promi&s;ed him Se|curity from all Men of Women born, might be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected by him; yet in the Field of Battle, a little after that, we find him as full of Confidence on that Prediction as if his Spirits had never deceived him.</P>
<Q><L>What's he,</L>
<L>That was not born of Woman? &s;uch a one</L>
<L>Am I to fear or none,</L></Q>
<P>And again.</P>
<Q><L>Swords I &s;mile at; Weapons laugh to Scorn,</L>
<L>Brandi&s;h'd by Man that's of a Woman born.</L></Q>
<P>And when challenged to Fight by <HI>Macduff,</HI> he &s;ays:
<Q><L>Thou lo&s;e&s;t Labour;</L>
<L>As ea&s;y may&s;t thou the intrenchant Air</L>
<L>With thy keen Sword impre&s;s, as make me bleed:</L>
<L>Let fall thy Blade on vulnerable Cre&s;ts,</L>
<L>I bear a charmed Life, which mu&s;t not yield</L>
<L>To one of Woman born,</L></Q></P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent is this vain-glorious Boa&s;t|ing and extravagant Confidence in a Man, who having been ju&s;t before told that the Wood was moving, makes the following Speech?</P>
<Q><PB N="292" REF="303">
<L>If thou &s;peak'&s;t fal&s;e,</L>
<L>Upon the next Tree &s;halt thou hang alive,</L>
<L>'Till Famine cling thee: If thy Speech be &s;ooth</L>
<L>I care not, if thou do&s;t for me as much.&mdash;</L>
<L>I pull in Re&s;olution, and begin</L>
<L>To doubt th' Equivocation of the Fiend,</L>
<L>That lies like Truth. Fear not, 'till <HI>Bernam</HI> Wood</L>
<L>Comes to <HI>Dun&s;inane.</HI>&mdash;And now a Wood</L>
<L>Comes towards Dun&s;inane. Arm, arm, and out!</L>
<L>If this, which he avouches, does appear,</L>
<L>There is not flying hence, nor tarrying here;</L>
<L>I'gin to be a weary of the Sun;</L>
<L>And wi&s;h the State o' th' World were now un|done</L>
<L>Ring the alarum Bell; blow Wind, come Wrack,</L>
<L>At lea&s;t, we'll die with Harne&s;s on our Back.</L></Q>
<P>But this Play has fewer Faults of this Kind than any other of <HI>Shake&s;pear's,</HI> and is de&s;erved|ly allowed to be a mo&s;t beautiful Piece.</P>
