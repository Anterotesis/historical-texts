<L>WHERE &s;ighs the Zephyr to yon lonely Tree,</L>
<L>A &s;olemn Grove its leafy Mantle &s;pread:</L>
<L>Where bend yon mould'ring Turrets o'er the Sea,</L>
<L>A venerable Dome once rear'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts Head.</L>

<L>The &s;olemn Grove, the venerable Dome,</L>
<L>Were er&s;t frequented by a num'rous Train,</L>
<L>Ev'n cha&s;te as they who Dian's Mountain roam,</L>
<L>But not &s;ubjected to her gentle Reign:</L>

<PB N="4" REF="3">
<L>Far other Godde&s;s did this Train obey,</L>
<L>Far other Temples, other Altars rais'd,</L>
<L>Far other Meaning breath'd their Choral Lay,</L>
<L>Far other Incen&s;e on their Altars blaz'd:</L>

<L>Veil'd Super&s;tition wak'd her magic Sound,</L>

<L>Alas! ob&s;equious to her &s;tern Command,</L>
<L>A &s;ullen-pen&s;ive Brotherhood they came,</L>
<L>Refus'd to trace the Paths by Nature plan'd,</L>
<L>And raz'd from Glory's Page their ancient Name.</L>

<L>Nor the&s;e alone were found incloi&s;ter'd here,</L>

<LG>
<L>On yon Du&s;t-level'd Spire the crafty Maid,</L>
<L>With Indignation brooding in her Brea&s;t</L>
<L>Sits gloomily&mdash;Her Vot'ries all are fled,</L>

<L>Couch'd at her Feet, behold a mould'ring Shrine</L>
<L>(Of various Relics once the dread Abode)</L>
<L>Where runs the Spider o'er his treach'rous Line,</L>

<LG>
<L>On Darkne&s;s' wing now &s;ails the midnight Hour,</L>
<L>When for the grateful Sound of choral Pray'r,</L>
<L>The &s;hrieking Owl from yon di&s;parted Tow'r,</L>

<L>The Path that leads to yonder &s;hatter'd Pile</L>

<L>The golden Crozier blended with the Du&s;t</L>
