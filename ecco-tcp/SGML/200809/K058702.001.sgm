<P>THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR, TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF GRANDISON, A NOBLEMAN NOT MORE DISTINGUISHED BY HIS HIGH RANK, THAN BY HIS MANY PRIVATE VIRTUES; WHICH EXALT HIS CHARACTER, ENDEAR HIM TO SOCIETY, AND REFLECT THE HIGHEST HONOUR ON HIS NATIVE COUNTRY.</P>

<P>THE author mo&s;t re&s;pectfully informs his readers, that the following &s;heets were from the nature of his &s;ituation, nece&s;&s;arily obliged to be written amid&s;t the hurry and bu&s;tle of the theatre. A very &s;trict application to the duties of his office there, often prevented him from paying that attention to this work, which it ju&s;tly demanded, and many of tho&s;e hours which ought to have been devoted to re&s;t, have been unavoidably &s;pent in preparing it for the pre&s;s. The&s;e rea&s;ons will, he hopes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure plead his excu&s;e for the various faults to be found throughout the whole.</P>
<P>Should this volume be &s;o fortunate as to meet with public approbation, it will encourage the author to proceed in his undertaking with cheerfulne&s;s, and in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing winter, to complete his original de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE very great utility of a well regu|lated &s;tage, and the many advantages to be derived from dramatic exhibitions, are &s;ubjects which have been already &s;o amply treated on, and &s;o univer&s;ally a&s;|&s;ented to, that they &s;eem &s;carcely to re|quire, or even to admit, of further en|largement. That the drama, under pro|per regulations, is capable of affording not only the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, but the mo&s;t forcible in&s;truction, is a truth, which we find e&s;tabli&s;hed as well by the practical experience of the wi&s;e&s;t nations, as by the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on and &s;pecu|lation.</P>
<P>We accordingly &s;ee, that the mo&s;t en|lightened &s;tates, both ancient and mo|dern, hath judged it proper, both in a political and moral point of view, to have frequent public exhibitions for the enter|tainment of the people; and it is no
<PB REF="11">
incon&s;iderable &s;anction to this &s;pecies of amu&s;ement, that in the very zenith of Greek and Roman greatne&s;s, the able&s;t lawgivers of tho&s;e days have ever care|fully cultivated the drama, convinced that it gave life to their in&s;titutions, and formed an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in the portion of public happine&s;s and liberty. The mutual connexion, indeed, between the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;tage, and the welfare of the &s;tate, have more than once been vi&s;ible, and it has with ju&s;tice been re|marked, that the political and theatrical pro&s;perity of a nation have gone nearly hand in hand.</P>
<P>An excellent writer ob&s;erves, that where the genius of a nation pre&s;erves its &s;ub|limity of character, and in&s;pires valour and liberality, the &s;tage will maintain its fir&s;t influence, and promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety: on the contrary, when a coun|try draws towards a period of glory, the &s;tage will fir&s;t feel its effects, and &s;oon &s;ink under the infection. This ob&s;erva|tion, with a very &s;light alteration, mu&s;t
<PB REF="12">
be allowed to be ju&s;t. That the progre&s;s of public integrity, and of theatrical per|fection are equal, and concomitant, can|not be denied. But at the &s;ame time, the former &s;eems as well to be influenced by, as to influence the latter.</P>
<P>A trifling hi&s;torical anecdote, among&s;t many others, may &s;erve to &s;hew us, that this was the ca&s;e at Milan. When Charles Barromeus took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Arch|bi&s;hoprick, through an abundant &s;everity and zeal for religion, he &s;hut up the playhou&s;e, and expelled the performers as corrupters of mankind. However, he had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent this ra&s;h pro|ceeding: for he found the people in&s;tead of growing better, running into all kinds of exce&s;&s;es. The rea&s;on was obvious; deprived of their u&s;ual amu&s;ements and proper diver&s;ions, they committed the mo&s;t horrid crimes by way of pa&s;time. Convinced thus of his error, he had, however, &s;ufficient hone&s;ty publicly to confe&s;s it. He accordingly revoked his former edict, recalled the bani&s;hed
<PB REF="13">
players, and granted them, as before, the free u&s;e and liberty of the &s;tage. A noble triumph of rea&s;on over ignorance, of ju&s;tice over enthu&s;ia&s;m!</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s here al&s;o to ob|&s;erve, that in England, during Cromwell's u&s;urpation, when fanatici&s;m and hypo|cri&s;y held &s;overeign &s;way throughout the kingdom, the poor unoffending &s;tage, fell a &s;acrifice to the prevailing &s;pirit of op|pre&s;&s;ion. Its entertainments were inter|dicted, and its profe&s;&s;ors loaded with ignominy. But when at length peace and order were re&s;tored to the nation and the various revolutions of capricious bigotry had exhau&s;ted them&s;elves, the &s;tage once more ventured to rear its head, and thence gradually to advance to, and at length &s;urpa&s;s, its former excellence. With the con&s;titution it fell, and with it was re&s;tored. &s;uch, and &s;o intimate, appears to be the connexion between the drama and the &s;tate, and &s;o mutually involved and in&s;eparable are their in|tere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB REF="14">Example, &s;ays Seneca, is a mode of in&s;truction &s;horter and more efficacious than precept. But example and precept properly blended, and interwoven toge|ther, cannot fail to con&s;titute the true&s;t and mo&s;t effectual method. And where &s;hall we find this the ca&s;e, but on the &s;tage? Where el&s;e &s;hall we find &s;o judi|cious, &s;o happy an intermixture of &s;entiments and of example? Where can we look for in&s;truction or for guidance through the various &s;tages of the bu&s;tling world, &s;o well as in the faithful copying &s;cenes of fictitious life? We are here influenced at once, by the double force of rea&s;on and experience, and pre&s;ented with an in&s;tructive mirror, which by re|flecting and reproving our errors, at the &s;ame time convinces us of their exi&s;tence, and urges us to their removal.</P>
<P>Of the many well known in&s;tances which prove the force of theatrical exhi|bitions, I &s;hall, I hope, be excu&s;ed for &s;electing one, on account of its peculiar aptne&s;s. It is &s;aid of Alexander, the
<PB REF="15">
noted tyrant of Pheraea, a man who&s;e cruelties di&s;graced human nature, and who&s;e heart &s;eemed callous to every more refined &s;en&s;ation, that being pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation of Euripides's Tragedy of Hecuba, he was &s;o much affected as to be con&s;trained to quit the theatre be|fore the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t act. On being a&s;ked the cau&s;e, he replied, "He was a&s;hamed to weep at the misfortunes of Hecuba and Polyxena, whil&s;t he daily embrued his hands in the blood of his own citizens."</P>
<P>But it is wa&s;te of words to dwell longer on a &s;ubject &s;o evident. That no human invention was ever &s;o well calculated to form and mould the manners of a free people, as the in&s;tructive picture of life exhibited in a theatre, I believe I may be ju&s;tified in a&s;&s;erting. "We are here," as that elegant writer Aaron Hill ob&s;erves, "humanized without &s;uffering; we be|come acquainted with the manners of nations, acquire a fine poli&s;h without travelling, and without the trouble of
<PB REF="16">
&s;tudy, imbibe the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, the mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons."</P>
<P>An in&s;titution, then, fraught with &s;o many advantages cannot fail to be wor|thy the &s;erious attention of every enlight|ened nation; nor is it with le&s;s honour to them&s;elves than to the object of their concern, that the guardians of our laws and liberties have lately interpo&s;ed their authority, to rectify its abu&s;es, correct its errors, and direct its future efforts to the original de&s;ign of the drama,&mdash;TO MAKE THE STAGE THE SCHOOL OF VIRTUE.</P>
<P>Such being the avowed utility of the Drama, and &s;uch its univer&s;al e&s;timation, it cannot be wondered that wherever the &s;tage has obtained footing, it has generally found admirers, who took plea|&s;ure in tracing its foot&s;teps, and record|ing its advances. The only in&s;tance to the contrary occurs where it might be lea&s;t expected. It has long been ob&s;erv|ed, that by &s;ome unaccountable neglect,
<PB REF="17">
Ireland &s;tands a &s;ingle exception. Every other country has produced numberle&s;s writers on the &s;ubject, whil&s;t it remains a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that in a nation &s;o remarkably fond of theatrical entertain|ments, &s;o liberal to its profe&s;&s;ors, and &s;o fortunately fruitful in dramatic writers of eminence, none &s;hould have been hitherto induced to attempt a regular, di&s;tinct hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the &s;tage in this kingdom, or a deline|ation of its various revolutions and vici&s;|&s;itudes, from its infancy down to the pre|&s;ent period.</P>
<P>A work of this nature executed with candour and ability, would, I am per|&s;uaded, not only prove a &s;ource of enter|tainment, and in&s;truction, but al&s;o amply recompen&s;e its author. A circum&s;tance which renders the want of &s;uch a hi&s;tory yet more &s;urpri&s;ing, is, that we cannot with ju&s;tice or impartiality con&s;ider what has hitherto been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, as either adequate or &s;atisfactory. The few attempts which have been made, have
<PB REF="18">
proved too trifling and detached to be of any real &s;ervice. The deficiency in this re&s;pect will, I doubt not, be allowed; but whether the pre&s;ent de&s;ign of remedying it may meet with an equally ready a&s;&s;ent, I am not quite &s;o certain.</P>
<P>It is, I confe&s;s, many years &s;ince the idea of &s;uch an attempt fir&s;t pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me. But the difficulty of exe|cuting it with propriety, and the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own inability, con|&s;tantly deterred me. Be&s;ides, I was not certain but that I might be guilty of an injury to the public, by anticipating what &s;ome abler pen might with more ju&s;tice execute. This hope, however, having been fru&s;trated, and years of fruitle&s;s ex|pectation elap&s;ed, I have thought it better to hazard even a defective attempt, than to &s;uffer a &s;ubject &s;o u&s;eful, to labour un|der a more continued neglect.</P>
<P>With this idea, the following pages are &s;ubmitted to an impartial public, with a full conviction of the difficulty of
<PB REF="19">
the undertaking, and the firme&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ion of every candid, every indulgent allowance. Of the nicety of the ta&s;k I am not unaware. Of my execution the public mu&s;t determine. To hit at the &s;ame time the oppo&s;ite ta&s;tes of various readers, to be at once in&s;tructive and entertaining, and to maintain both the accuracy of the hi&s;torian and the &s;pirit of an author, are contraries which I am &s;en&s;ible how difficult it is to blend together with judgment. Such, however, as the pre&s;ent work is, I offer it, convinced that it will meet with all the approbation it de&s;erves; and contented, if this humble attempt &s;hould prove the means of incit|ing &s;uperior abilities, to re&s;cue &s;o worthy a &s;ubject from that unmerited ob&s;curity, in which it has hitherto been involved.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING profe&s;&s;edly confined my&s;elf to the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the &s;tage in this kingdom, I
<PB N="2" REF="31">
&s;hall decline entering into the minutiae of its origin in Greece, or its fir&s;t introduction into Rome, Britain, or other countries; &s;uch di&s;qui|&s;itions would be foreign to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; mo&s;t of the&s;e points are be&s;ides &s;ufficiently known, and nearly all have been already ably treated on.</P>
<P>But, whil&s;t I endeavour to avoid every thing &s;uperfluous or unnece&s;&s;ary, I find my&s;elf obliged to confe&s;s, that my &s;ubject, at lea&s;t the earlier part of it, does not, by its fruitfulne&s;s, &s;uffi|ciently compen&s;ate for this exclu&s;ion. The era, on which I am about to enter, like the remote parts of all hi&s;tory, is not of a nature the mo&s;t productive or entertaining: the informa|tion to be attained is but very little, and even that little &s;o enveloped in the prevailing igno|rance and uncertainty of the times, that it affords but trifling materials for a clear or connected detail; even where accounts are mo&s;t authentic, the remotene&s;s of the periods prevents them from being, in any high degree, enlivened or intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>At what time theatrical amu&s;ements fir&s;t ob|tained footing in this kingdom, has never yet been accurately a&s;certained; the general opinion
<PB N="3" REF="32">
is, that the drama aro&s;e later in this than in mo&s;t countries of Europe. This peculiar exclu&s;ion of the &s;tage, appears the more &s;ingular and ex|traordinary, as Ireland was &s;o early celebrated as the &s;eat of learning, and the parent of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of bards, poets, and men of eminent genius for &s;everal centuries. The Iri&s;h lan|guage is allowed to be remarkable for harmony, mu&s;ic, and variety of modulation; the fame of their bards in the earlier ages &s;pread over all Europe. We are informed from the be&s;t autho|rity, that every ancient and noble family had, as one of their e&s;tabli&s;hed hou&s;ehold, a poet or hi&s;toriographer, who&s;e province it was, to cele|brate the martial and heroic deeds of their ance&s;|tors, to record their eminent actions, and by &s;inging their prai&s;es at all public and private a&s;&s;emblies, in&s;pire their de&s;cendants with a ge|nerous emulation: Even the kings had their poets laureat long before the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land by the Engli&s;h; nay, in &s;uch veneration were tho&s;e bards held, that they were permitted to wear robes of the &s;ame colour with the royal family; and had ample e&s;tates appropriated to them, that they might live in ea&s;e and inde|pendence. Every principal bard retained thirty of inferior note, and a bard of the &s;econd cla&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="33">
was attended by a retinue of fifteen; and in their great national triennial councils, where matters of the fir&s;t importance were debated, they had particular &s;eats allotted them.</P>
<P>The&s;e bards &s;eem to have been at their highe&s;t pitch of reputation about the year 558. Many of their compo&s;itions have reached us, which breathe all the beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of ea&s;tern poetry, and reflect infinite honour on their me|mories. But, among all the&s;e, not a trace re|mains of any attempt towards a dramatic com|po&s;ition: a circum&s;tance the more to be re|gretted, as tho&s;e pieces which they have left us are in the highe&s;t e&s;timation, and afford us every rea&s;on to believe that this &s;ubject would have met with the mo&s;t ample ju&s;tice and &s;upport in &s;uch able hands.</P>
<P>But it is not this circum&s;tance alone, which gives us cau&s;e to wonder at the want of dramatic entertainments in this kingdom; a cu&s;tom, which in tho&s;e times, was prevalent throughout Europe, might be expected to have gained &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment here likewi&s;e. The cu&s;tom I allude to, is that of the my&s;teries or moralities, which were, with great popularity, repre&s;ented
<PB N="5" REF="34">
in mo&s;t of the countries of Europe. Of the&s;e, however, the mo&s;t minute inve&s;tigation will not furni&s;h us with the &s;malle&s;t traces here; unle&s;s we deem a cla&s;s of mummers who &s;till &s;troll about the country at Chri&s;tmas, to be the remains of that kind of entertainment.</P>
<P>That the reader may have &s;ome idea of the nature of tho&s;e exhibitions, or my&s;teries, I &s;hall &s;elect an account of one in particular, which may &s;erve to give us a little in&s;ight into their general nature. It was exhibited in Che&s;ter, in the year 1327; continued for &s;everal days, and drew together a prodigious concour&s;e of people from all the adjacent country. In order that the&s;e people might be indulged in a greater facility of &s;eeing and hearing, an amphitheatre was rai&s;ed, for the occa&s;ion, in a large open field, where the pro|&s;pect was extended and uninterrupted. The repre&s;entation of one of tho&s;e pieces, which they called a play, took up &s;everal days, and, being attended with heavy expences, were performed at the charge of the different trading companies.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="36">Each of tho&s;e pieces had their re&s;pective machinery, and the actors were dre&s;&s;ed accord|ing to their ideas of character. The perform|ance was called, <HI>A repre&s;entation of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</HI> The reader may, perhaps, &s;mile at the whim&s;ical combinations of &s;everal of the&s;e pieces and performers; but that he may conceive a more perfect idea of the manner of conducting them, the proceeding was as follows:</P>
<P>The Deity, repre&s;ented as an old man, fir&s;t enters, creating the world: that done, he breathes life into Adam, leads him into paradi&s;e, and opens his &s;ide while &s;leeping; Adam and Eve next appear, naked, but void of &s;hame at being &s;o; the old &s;erpent then enters lamenting his fall; he conver&s;es with Eve and tempts her; &s;he eats of the forbidden fruit, and gives part to Adam; they find them&s;elves naked, and being no longer &s;o innocently uncon&s;cious of their &s;ituation, &s;eek for a remedy, and, accord|ing to their words, in the &s;tage direction from the manu&s;cript, look out for <HI>Subligacula a foliis quibus tegamus pudenda</HI>; they cover their nakedne&s;s, and conver&s;e with God's cur&s;e; the &s;erpent exits hi&s;&s;ing. They are next repre&s;ented as driven from paradi&s;e by four angels, and
<PB N="8" REF="37">
the cherubim with a flaming &s;word. Then Adam appears digging the ground and Eve &s;pinning. Their children Cain and Abel then enter; the former kills his brother; Adam's lamentation; Cain is bani&s;hed, &amp;c. A &s;trange medley! and &s;ufficient to &s;hew us at once both the inclination of the times for theatrical repre|&s;entations, and their rudene&s;s in the execution of them.</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;ubject.&mdash;It was the unfortunate lot of the &s;tage in this country, that its introduction and earlier progre&s;s were attended with more than u&s;ual uncertainty. The &s;i&s;ter kingdom, can, with the greate&s;t accuracy, trace the advances of her Drama, &s;tep by &s;tep, among them, from the conque&s;t to the pre&s;ent times; but the&s;e advantages are denied us. The period generally agreed upon for its fir&s;t introduction into this kingdom, is the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. But an ab&s;tract from the annals of this city, mentions the performance of &s;ome plays in Henry the eighth's time, before the earl of O&s;&s;ory, then lord lieutenant, and &s;everal of the nobility in Hoggin-green, now called College-green.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="38">What the&s;e plays were, whether my&s;teries, moralities or interludes, we are left to con|jecture. But it mu&s;t be remembered, that the fir&s;t piece which bore the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to dramatic compo&s;ition in the Engli&s;h language, was written about this time by John Heywood, the epigrammati&s;t, and called Gammer Gurton's Needle. It is, indeed, on every account, pro|bable, that the introduction of the Drama into this kingdom was much earlier than is u&s;ually imagined. The univer&s;al inclination, which all nations, even the mo&s;t rude and uncultivated, have ever &s;hewn for this &s;pecies of entertain|ment, the peculiar ta&s;te of this country for literature, with &s;everal other concurring rea&s;ons, render it highly improbable, that Ireland &s;hould &s;tand a &s;ingle exception to &s;o general an in&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>At the time, however, of Elizabeth, accounts became at lea&s;t more authentic. The inter|cour&s;e between the two kingdoms was then more frequent. The Engli&s;h &s;tage was ri&s;ing to higher repute, and could hardly fail of impart|ing to us, &s;omething of that regularity which ob&s;ervation and experience had &s;ugge&s;ted to them. Shake&s;peare, Ma&s;&s;inger, Beaumont,
<PB N="10" REF="39">
Fletcher, and John&s;on, ro&s;e to enlighten and refine the age, and we may, without prejudice or partiality, conclude, that Ireland partook, at lea&s;t in a remote degree, of this &s;en&s;ible change in the republic of letters. We are told, indeed, that Shake&s;peare's writings were at that time as high in e&s;timation here as in London.</P>
<P>We have not, however, any account of a re|gular theatre being then e&s;tabli&s;hed here. Plays were occa&s;ionally exhibited, as was cu&s;tomary in England, in the hou&s;es of noblemen and gentlemen. Some of them, we find, were per|formed in the ball-room of the Ca&s;tle of Dublin, in which the nobility were the principal actors. Mr. A&s;hbury, afterwards manager, was in|formed by Mr. Ogilby, then deputy ma&s;ter of the revels, of &s;ome repre&s;entations there, at the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, when Blount, Lord Mountjoy, was lord-lieutenant, and it is thought that the gentlemen of the court were the performers on this occa&s;ion. One of the plays then acted was Gorboduc, written by the right honourable Thomas Sackville, lord Buck|hur&s;t. Mr. A&s;hbury &s;aw a bill for wax-tapers, dated the 7th of September, 1601, queen Eliza|beth's birth day, for <HI>the play of Gorboduc, done
<PB N="11" REF="40">
at the ca&s;tle, one and twenty &s;hillings and two groats.</HI> This dramatic piece was e&s;teemed the be&s;t of its kind at the time it was written. It was a favourite play of queen Elizabeth's; and was performed by the gentlemen of the Inner Temple, Whitehall, before the queen on the 18th of January, 1561, long before Shake&s;peare appeared on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This anecdote excepted, we find little relative to the &s;tage, till the year 1635, the tenth of king Charles I. when the fir&s;t theatre in Dublin was rai&s;ed. It was built in Werburgh-&s;treet, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by John Ogilby, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was then hi&s;toriographer to his maje&s;ty, and ma&s;ter of the revels under the earl of Stafford, lord lieute|nant of this kingdom. This building we may rea&s;onably conclude, was far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that convenience or elegance which modern improvements in theatrical architecture have enabled us to attain. Nor can we entertain a very high idea of the variety of its &s;cenery and decorations. Even the London theatres, in Shake&s;peare's days, were con&s;iderably deficient in tho&s;e particulars. But notwith&s;tanding, we are informed, that this was tolerably large and commodious, with a gallery and pit; but no
<PB N="12" REF="41">
boxes, except one on the &s;tage for the lord lieutenant.</P>
<P>So very little can be collected with any degree of certainty of the company who performed at this theatre, that not even their names, or but few of the pieces they acted, have been tran&s;|mitted to us. Almo&s;t all that can be a&s;certained is, that they played with good &s;ucce&s;s, and were much followed. In 1638, three years after their commencement, they produced a new play, called the Royal Ma&s;ter, written by Shirley, an intimate friend of the manager. This writer, we are told, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ketches of Beaumont and Fletcher; which, if true, in a great mea&s;ure accounts for the inequality &s;o evident in all his pieces. The next year brought forth a tragi|comedy called Langartha, written by Henry Burnell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a native of Ireland. This piece was for &s;everal years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, and was afterwards printed with the&s;e words in the title page, "as acted at the <HI>New Theatre in Dublin,</HI> 1641, with great applau&s;e." But to our mortification, none of the actors names were in&s;erted in the dramatis per&s;onae. Tragi|comedies were at this time highly in vogue. The plot of this play was taken from the Dani&s;h
<PB N="13" REF="42">
hi&s;tory of Saxo Gramaticus, and 'tis whim&s;ical enough to ob&s;erve, that the prologue was &s;poken by an Amazon, armed with a battle-axe, to be&s;peak the favour of the audience. It was, perhaps, in allu&s;ion to this circum&s;tance, that the duke of Buckingham afterwards &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully introduced his prologue of Thunder and Light|ning in the Rehear&s;al.</P>
<P>But this fair beginning, and &s;eemingly pro&s;|perous advance of the &s;tage, received, a &s;hort time after, a &s;evere blow. Langartha was the la&s;t play that was acted at Werburgh-&s;treet theatre. The rebellion breaking out in the October of the &s;ame year 1641, involved the whole kingdom in confu&s;ion. The drama naturally &s;hared the fate of the &s;tate, with which it was &s;o intimately connected. The theatre was &s;hut up by order of the lords ju&s;tices, and never afterwards opened. What became of the performers we cannot learn. Perhaps, like &s;ome of their brethren in London on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, they entered into the &s;er|vice of their king and country. Of the manager, Mr. Ogilby, we are told, that, exhau&s;ted and reduced by various misfortunes, he returned to England, where he intended to remain till the tumults &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide, and a happier revolution
<PB N="14" REF="43">
of affairs afford him an opportunity of re&s;uming his former &s;ituation with &s;afely and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A period of twenty years elap&s;ed, before this wi&s;hed for change took place. At length, however, the nation having wearied it&s;elf out by inte&s;tine commotions, and Charles the &s;econd being happily placed on the throne, things began to recover an appearance of tranquillity. At this time Mr. Ogilby's friends procured him a renewal of the patent from his maje&s;ty, and in 1662 he returned to this kingdom, to the particular joy of his own acquaintance, and the &s;atisfaction of the public in general. Compa&s;|&s;ion for his &s;ufferings, and a reviving ta&s;te for the drama in a &s;hort time operated with &s;uch force, as to influence the nobility and gentry to &s;ub&s;cribe towards the building of a new theatre. Smock-alley, then called Orange-&s;treet, was the &s;pot fixed on: a place by its central &s;ituation, peculiarly adapted for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. The foun|dation was quickly laid, and the work advanced with &s;uch rapidity as to be ready for repre|&s;entations in the &s;ame year 1662. A tragedy called Pompey, from the French of Corneille, was then acted at this theatre. This tran&s;|lation was by Mrs. Catherine Phillips, the famed
<PB N="15" REF="44">
Orinda, termed by her cotemporary poets the Engli&s;h Sappho. We hear al&s;o of another of this lady's tran&s;lations from the &s;ame author, called Horace. Neither of tho&s;e pieces were acted in England till after her death in 1664, near two years later than their performance here.</P>
<P>If we may be allowed to form an idea of the elegance of this theatre from its expence, we mu&s;t imagine it to have been very con&s;iderable, as it is &s;aid to have co&s;t upwards of two thou&s;and pounds, a great sum at that time; e&s;pecially when it is recollected, that new &s;cenery and de|corations had not then been introduced, even in England. In all probability Smock-alley theatre was &s;uperior to tho&s;e then in London; for according to Downes, <Q>on the re&s;toration, the &s;cattered remnants of &s;ix play-hou&s;es, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in king Charles the fir&s;t's time, formed a company and acted again at the <HI>Bull Play Hou&s;e,</HI> then built them a new theatre in Gib|bons Tennis-Court, Clare-Market, at which two places they continued acting 1660, 1661, 1662, and part of 1663.</Q> The ha&s;te however with which it was rai&s;ed, was &s;hortly after nearly proving fatal to it: for in the year 1671, during the repre&s;entation, part of it fell down, by which
<PB N="16" REF="45">
accident two were killed, and many &s;everely wounded. This misfortune put another total &s;top to dramatic entertainments for a long time. By tho&s;e repeated cro&s;&s;es and failures, Mr. Ogilby was at length &s;o worn out and di&s;gu&s;ted, that finding his &s;ucce&s;s by no means corre&s;pondent to his expectations, he finally returned to London, where he died in 1676.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE death of Mr. Ogilby proved the fore|runner of a long interval of inaction to the &s;tage. New troubles ari&s;ing, and fre&s;h tumults breaking forth, prevented its re&s;toration. The un&s;ettled &s;tate of the kingdom during the &s;econd James's reign, kept the public mind in too con|tinued a &s;tate of alarm and apprehen&s;ion to admit of any calm or peaceable relaxation. The peo|ple will nece&s;&s;arily attend to the pre&s;ervation of their &s;afety, before they give way to the grati|fication of plea&s;ure. It was be&s;ide, peculiarly the fate of this kingdom to bear a con&s;picuous
<PB N="18" REF="47">
part in the prevailing di&s;turbances, and be the melancholy &s;cene of action for mo&s;t of the events which en&s;ued. Thus &s;ituated, every refined and rational entertainment was cru&s;hed, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by the hand of violence.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the theatre did not take place, till the revolution had once more re&s;tored tranquillity, and pre&s;ented a pro&s;pect of peace with her &s;miling train, re|turning to ble&s;s this divided kingdom with her permanent abode. Among&s;t the various te&s;ti|monies of joy for this event, the public deter|mined on the performance of a play. But the difficulty lay in procuring performers. The re|gular actors were di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered by the late war, and it was impo&s;&s;ible at once to re|collect them. To &s;upply this emergency, and at the &s;ame time to gratify their own inclinations, &s;everal gentlemen, principally officers about the ca&s;tle, agreed to exhibit the tragedy of Othello. Mr. A&s;hbury, who happened then to be in Dublin, was the only profe&s;&s;ional actor among&s;t them. He played Iago, and, from his approved knowledge of the drama, had the conduct of the whole. This play was performed gratis, at Smock-alley theatre, &s;ome time in December
<PB N="19" REF="48">
1691, and is marked by a peculiar circum&s;tance, which to every theatrical reader cannot fail to render it highly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the gentlemen who performed, was the celebrated Mr. Wilkes, who afterwards proved &s;o great an ornament to the &s;tage. This gentleman was de&s;cended from an antient family, &s;eated for many generations at Broom&s;grove in Worce&s;ter&s;hire. The grandfather of our famous comedian, Judge Wilkes, rai&s;ed a troop of hor&s;e at his own expence, which was commanded by his brother colonel Wilkes, and voluntarily entered into the &s;ervice of king Charles the fir&s;t, during the civil wars. But matters taking &s;o unfortunate a turn with the royal party, the family &s;uffered every per&s;ecution which the violence of the times could &s;ugge&s;t, and was at la&s;t obliged to take &s;helter in Ireland. It was at Rathfarnham, near Dublin, in the year 1670, that our hero was born. He received a liberal education, and it was, probably, from his &s;kill in penman&s;hip, that he was placed under &s;ecretary Southwell, as principal clerk. He here contracted an intimacy with Mr. Richards, an actor of great merit, who belonged to the Smock-alley company before it was broken up. During his acquaintance with this gentleman,
<PB N="20" REF="49">
he u&s;ed frequently to hear him rehear&s;e his parts, and was ofttimes induced to repeat &s;ome of the foregoing &s;peeches. The uncom|mon propriety of his delivery, and the many compliments he received on the&s;e occa&s;ions, were the fir&s;t means of attaching his mind to the &s;tage, and &s;o fully was his fame e&s;tabli&s;hed, that at the time of performing this play, the part of Othello was unanimou&s;ly allotted to him, in con&s;ideration of his &s;uperior abilities. His execution of this difficult character &s;o far exceeded the expectations of every one pre&s;ent, that from that time, he determined to give up his employment, though extremely lucrative, and devote his future life and abilities to the &s;tage. The performance of this play, proved the means of reviving a &s;pirit for dramatic exhi|bitions in this kingdom, and offered a favourable opportunity of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the theatre.</P>
<P>On the death of Mr. Ogilby, in 1672, the patent, together with the office of ma&s;ter of the revels, was, by means of his intere&s;t with the duke of Ormond, conferred on Mr. A&s;hbury. As this gentleman de&s;ervedly claims a con&s;pi|cuous place in the following pages, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to inform my readers, that he was born
<PB N="21" REF="50">
in London, in the year 1638, of a re&s;pectable family, and received a cla&s;&s;ical education at Eaton &s;chool. After the death of his father, his friends procured him a pair of colours in the army, under the duke of Ormond, with whom he fir&s;t vi&s;ited this kingdom, in the la&s;t year of Oliver Cromwell's admini&s;tration. During the war he had &s;everal opportunities of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf; particularly when governor Jones was &s;eized in the Ca&s;tle of Dublin, and &s;ecured in favour of Charles the Second. His merit &s;oon rai&s;ed him to the rank of lieutenant of foot, and &s;hortly after, the duke of Ormond, then lord lieutenant, with whom he was in con&s;iderable favour, made him one of the gentlemen of his retinue, and deputy ma&s;ter of the revels under Mr. Ogilby.</P>
<P>Judging the pre&s;ent a favourable opportunity, Mr. A&s;hbury applied to &s;everal of the nobility and gentry to promote the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;tage, and receiving very great encourage|ment, he repaired to London, to try what forces he could mu&s;ter. His &s;ucce&s;s there, was beyond his expectation. He returned with a number of capital performers, particularly the well-known Mrs. Butler, an actre&s;s of great
<PB N="22" REF="51">
repute, and a prodigious favourite with King Charles the Second. This monarch had honour|ed her, by naming her chri&s;tian name Charlotte, and, as &s;he grew up, recommended her to the theatre, to which &s;he proved a valuable acqui|&s;ition. She was not only a good actre&s;s, but an excellent &s;inger and dancer. Her fort chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in comic characters. But &s;he was by no means confined to one line: for, with an elegant air, a &s;weet-toned voice, and a &s;en&s;ible pronunciation, &s;he &s;u&s;tained many parts in &s;erious comedies with much reputation. In charac|ters of humour, &s;he was gay, lively, and enter|taining, and her &s;econd Con&s;tantia in the Chances, was allowed by Cibber, who &s;aw them both, to be &s;uperior to Mrs. Oldfield's.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance which proved the cau&s;e of her engaging with Mr. A&s;hbury, may &s;erve to &s;hew us the humble &s;tate of the London theatres at that time. Mrs. Butler, though at the head of her profe&s;&s;ion, had a &s;alary of no more than forty &s;hillings per week; and it was in a fit of di&s;gu&s;t, at not being able to obtain an increa&s;e of ten &s;hillings, that &s;he li&s;tened to Mr. A&s;hbury's propo&s;als. With her were engaged Mr. Wilkes,
<PB N="23" REF="52">
and Mr. E&s;tcourt, who had not as yet appeared on any &s;tage, and was only known as a mimic.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a company, and with the &s;kill in Dramatic affairs which Mr. A&s;hbury was allowed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s. He opened with Othello, March the 23d 1692, the day of proclaiming the end of the Iri&s;h war, and continued performing for &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons with the highe&s;t credit and profit. Many per|formers of eminence vi&s;ited Dublin during this period; among&s;t the men, the names of Wilkes, Dogget, Keen, Norris, Griffith, Trefu&s;is, E&s;tcourt, and afterwards Elrington, &s;tand in high e&s;timation. His principal ladies were Mrs. A&s;hbury, his own wife, an excellent figure, and good actre&s;s, particularly in tender charac|ters in tragedy, and elegant ladies in comedy, Mrs. Knightly, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Schoolding, Mrs. Hook, be&s;ides the above-mentioned Mrs. Butler.</P>
<P>Some years after he received another con&s;ider|able acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength. Barton Booth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> having in vain applied to Mr. Betterton for admi&s;&s;ion to the London &s;tage, arrived in 1698 in Dublin. His &s;ucce&s;s was here much better,
<PB N="24" REF="53">
and he agreed with the manager, to make his fir&s;t appearance in Oroonoko. This he per|formed to a crouded hou&s;e, and &s;o much delighted Mr. A&s;hbury, that immediately after the performance, he made him a pre&s;ent of five guineas; a &s;um which, tho' not very con&s;iderable, was, however, peculiarly acceptable to him, as his la&s;t &s;hilling was ha&s;tening fa&s;t to di&s;&s;olution. By this acce&s;&s;ion, the company was rendered re&s;pectable, and continued to perform with very great &s;ucce&s;s. Indeed, if we may credit Mr. Chetwood, who was for a long time con|ver&s;ant with the &s;tage, the performers at that time were not inferior to any &s;ince. But to convey every information which the &s;ubject admits of, I &s;hall beg leave to pre&s;ent the reader with the manner in which three of Sir George Etheridge's comedies (then in great e&s;timation) were performed; as al&s;o, with the repre&s;enta|tion of two more plays &s;ome years after, that he may be enabled both to judge of the &s;trength of the company, and the revolutions it ex|perienced during that time.</P>

<P>In the above play the celebrated Mr. Quin made his fir&s;t appearance in the character of Abel.</P>
<P>"Di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the bills," &s;ays Mr. Chetwood, <Q>at the time the&s;e plays were performed, were not in fa&s;hion. They were printed in order, according as they &s;tood, not regarding the merit of the actor. As for example, in Macbeth,&mdash;Dun|can, king of Scotland, appeared fir&s;t in the bills, though acted by an in&s;ignificant actor: and &s;o every other per&s;on appeared, accord|ing to his dramatic dignity, all of the &s;ame &s;ized letter. But,</Q> adds he, <Q>I can a&s;&s;ure my readers, I have found it very difficult to plea&s;e them, and &s;ome were to very fond of elbow-room, that they would have &s;hoved
<PB N="30" REF="59">
every body out but them&s;elves: as if one per&s;on was to do all, and have the merit of all. Like generals of an army, &s;uch a victory was gained by &s;uch a king, and &s;uch a prince, while the other officers and &s;oldiers were forgot. But as Trim tells us, in <HI>The Funeral,</HI> or <HI>Grief A-la-Mode,</HI> fifty thou&s;and of &s;uch ra&s;cals will make an Alexander.</Q></P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s here, to take &s;ome notice of Mr. George Farquhar, who, though not a performer of eminence, by his writings at lea&s;t, will ever reflect honour on his country and him|&s;elf. He was was born in Derry, in the year 1678, and entered into the Univer&s;ity of Dublin, 1694. His father, dying &s;oon after, he was left at full liberty to follow his own inclina|tions: when, by the intere&s;t of Mr. Wilkes, who was his particular friend through life, he was recommended to the manager of Smock-alley, in 1695, who engaged him at the low &s;alary of twenty &s;hillings per week. His fir&s;t appearance was in Othello, in which he gained &s;ome applau&s;e. But he &s;eemed not by nature to have been intended for the &s;tage. His voice was weak, and he was &s;ubject to a timidity, which precluded all boldne&s;s of exertion, and
<PB N="31" REF="60">
which his utmo&s;t efforts could never overcome. However, with the recommendations of a grace|ful per&s;on, and a &s;en&s;ible delivery, he remained for &s;ome time on the &s;tage, and was tolerably well received. How long he might have con|tinued in this line, we know not; had not an unlucky accident which happened in 1697, put a period to his performing. Being to play Guyo|mar in the Indian Emperor, who kills Va&s;quez, and having forgot to change his &s;word for a foil, he wounded Mr. Price, who acted Va&s;quez, dangerou&s;ly, though not fatally. The impre&s;&s;ion which this accident made on a mind &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and the reflection on what might have been the con&s;equences, determined him to relinqui&s;h a profe&s;&s;ion which might, perhaps, expo&s;e him to &s;imilar mi&s;takes in future. He re&s;olved, there|fore, to comply with the frequent &s;olicitations of his friend, Mr. Wilkes, who knew that the bent of his genius, was much more inclined to|wards writing than acting. Accordingly, having obtained a free benefit from Mr. A&s;hbury, ever a friend to merit, he &s;et off for London with the rough copy of Love and a Bottle. This piece was brought out, &s;hortly after, with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, and was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by another, the Con&s;tant Couple, which in 1700, had a run in
<PB N="32" REF="61">
London of 53, and in Dublin of 23 nights, cir|cum&s;tances which, every thing con&s;idered, were equally extraordinary.</P>
<P>In 1704 he again vi&s;ited Dublin, when his finances, like tho&s;e of mo&s;t authors being low, and failing in a &s;ub&s;cription for his works, he obtained leave from the duke of Ormond, lord lieutenant, (being at that time in the army) to perform his own Sir Harry Wildair for a benefit. This attempt, though it augmented his finances, by bringing him in a hundred pounds, proved no increa&s;e to his theatrical reputation. He did not acquit him&s;elf at all to the &s;atisfaction of his friends. His fate, indeed, &s;eems to have been &s;imilar to that of many excellent dramatic authors, who&s;e acting is by no means equal to their writing, and who are incapable of repre&s;enting what they them&s;elves compo&s;e. Shortly after this, Mr. Farquhar returned to London, where he died in 1707, beloved and &s;incerely lamented. The particulars of his death are too well known to require mentioning here.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes did not remain in Dublin long after his friend. On the death of Horden in
<PB N="33" REF="62">
1698, he received an invitation from Mr. Rich, manager of Covent-Garden, with an offer of four pounds a week. This was a propo&s;al too flattering to be rejected. The &s;alary was at that time extraordinary, and equal to Mr. Bet|terton's. He accordingly took leave of Mr. A&s;hbury. They parted good friends, nor did the manager repine at his lo&s;s, when his &s;udden advancement was the cau&s;e. His merit in a &s;hort time rai&s;ed him to the head of his profe&s;&s;ion, and in 1711, we find him paying another vi&s;it to his native country. Here he &s;taid three months, during which time he performed his favourite character of Sir Harry Wildair, nine|teen nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at Smock-alley theatre.</P>
<P>Some time before this event, a remarkable circum&s;tance happened, which &s;trongly marks the &s;uper&s;titious ca&s;t of the public mind. On St. Stephen's day, in the year 1701, the galleries of the theatre being uncommonly crouded, gave way, and, though no lives were lo&s;t, yet &s;everal were hurt in endeavouring to get out. As this happened to be the fir&s;t night of per|forming Shadwell's Libertine, a play extremely loo&s;e, and improper for repre&s;entation, it gave occa&s;ion to the people, to declare that the acci|dent
<PB N="34" REF="63">
was a judgment on the &s;pectators, for going to &s;ee it. Nay, &s;o far did their extravagance carry them, that it was even a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that the candles burnt blue, and went out, that two or three times a dancer extraordinary, whom nobody knew, was &s;een, that he had a cloven foot, &amp;c. &amp;c. with many other ridicu|lous &s;tories. This gentleman, I &s;uppo&s;e it was, who made free with the galleries, and was the author of the whole di&s;turbance. This circum|&s;tance, however, occa&s;ioned its not being per|formed again for 20 years. It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, that, though this accident might as well have happened at any other time, yet this piece is of a nature &s;o very horrid, that it &s;hould never be brought before the public; it has, therefore, with great propriety been laid a&s;ide for many years, I hope never to be revived.</P>
<P>The next remarkable occurrence with regard to the &s;tage, is the death of one of its principal ornaments, Jo&s;eph A&s;hbury, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> July 24th, 1720. He died at the advanced age of 82, retaining to his la&s;t moments his faculties entire. Mr. A&s;hbury had always maintained an excellent character. He was e&s;teemed not only the be&s;t actor but the be&s;t teacher in the three kingdoms.
<PB N="35" REF="64">
So high indeed was his reputation in the latter character, that he in&s;tructed the prince&s;s Anne, afterwards queen, in the part of Semandra in Mithridates, king of Pontus, which was acted by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank in the Banquetting-Hou&s;e, Whitehall, where Mr. A&s;hbury was prompter and conductor of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. His abilities were peculiarly adapted to the &s;itua|tion which he filled. He appears to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much judgment in theatrical affairs, and under his management the Iri&s;h &s;tage ro&s;e to a degree of re&s;pectability, which it had not hitherto experienced. Nor was his private life le&s;s amiable or happy than his public. Univer|&s;ally beloved by a numerous acquaintance, and remarkably fortunate in the conjugal &s;tate, his length of life was unaccompanied by a diminution of regard from his friends, and he was quickly followed to the grave, by a faithful and affec|tionate wife. Mr. Chetwood, who &s;aw him in the decline of life, &s;ays <Q>his per&s;on was of an advantageous height, well proportioned, and manly; and notwith&s;tanding his great age, erect: a countenance that demanded a reve|rential awe: a full, meaning eye, piercing, though not in its full lu&s;tre, and yet I have &s;een him read letters and printed books without

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the death of Mr. A&s;hbury, the management of the theatre devolved to his &s;on-in-law, Thomas Elrington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a gentleman of genius and ability, well qualified for &s;o arduous an undertaking. He al&s;o &s;ucceeded his father-in-law as deputy ma&s;ter of the revels, and &s;teward to the King's Inns of Court, then on the Inns-Quay. Still more to e&s;tabli&s;h his intere&s;t, and mark the favour in which he was held, a po&s;t in the Quit Rent Office was conferred upon him, and he was made gunner to the train of artillery, a gift of his friend lord Mountjoy, which, at the death of that nobleman, he had
<PB N="38" REF="67">
permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e of. This accumulation of favours on the manager, &s;poke fair for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the theatre; nor were the expectations of the public di&s;appointed. The &s;tage, which his predece&s;&s;or had taken &s;uch pains to replant and cheri&s;h, was under his prudent conduct improved and extended. Its reputation was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and its profe&s;&s;ors held in high e&s;timation. Many of the fir&s;t actors occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited Dublin, particularly Mr. Henry Giffard, who came over to this kingdom from Lincoln's-Inn theatre in 1724, and remained till 1730, when he returned to London, and commenced manager of Good|man's Fields, a &s;tation he filled many years with credit.&mdash;Among&s;t the con&s;tant re&s;idents, we find Thomas Griffith, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a gentleman de&s;cended from an ancient family in Wales, an excellent actor in comedy, a man of genius and an un|blemi&s;hed character, of whom I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to &s;peak, a Mr. John Evans, Mr. Vanderbank, Mr. Hu&s;band, &amp;c.</P>
<P>All the new pieces brought out at the London theatres were, under this judicious manager, carefully got up, and exhibited with reputation. The principal of the&s;e were, the Bold Stroke for a Wife, of Mrs. Centlivres; the Siege of Da|ma&s;cus,
<PB N="39" REF="68">
by Hughes; the Refu&s;al and Provoked Hu&s;band, of Cibber; Bu&s;iris and Revenge of Dr. Young; Steele's Con&s;cious Lovers, Gay's Beggars Opera, and Lillo's George Barnwell: concerning the two la&s;t, their great merit, and the &s;ingularity of their fir&s;t reception, demand particular mention; and as the circum&s;tances are not generally known, I &s;hall beg leave to tre&s;pa&s;s on my readers patience by relating them.</P>
<P>Mr. Gay, the author of the Beggars Opera, was a man of acknowledged abilities. His former eminent productions, joined to his amiable cha|racter in private life, had &s;ecured him the friend|&s;hip of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed writers of the age. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and with &s;uch in|trin&s;ic merit as the Beggars Opera is allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, it might naturally be expected to have met with that reception which it after|wards &s;o warmly experienced. But, this was by no means the ca&s;e. The managers of Drury|lane, to whom it was fir&s;t offered, peremptorily rejected it. Were it not authenticated beyond contradiction, we &s;hould &s;carce credit, that &s;uch judges as Wilkes, Booth, and Cibber mu&s;t be of dramatic writing, &s;hould be &s;o far deceived
<PB N="40" REF="69">
as to he&s;itate a moment in their opinion of &s;uch a piece. It was with great difficulty that Mr. Rich, the manager of Lincoln's-Inn theatre, could be prevailed on to let it have a trial, and after the fir&s;t rehear&s;al, he gave it up, as a piece which to a certainty would be condemned.</P>
<P>This general oppo&s;ition to a work of &s;uch ac|knowledged excellence, cannot fail, at fir&s;t, to rai&s;e our &s;urpri&s;e, but a little reflection may per|haps enable us, in &s;ome degree, to account for this &s;eeming contradiction. The Beggars Opera was in a &s;tile of compo&s;ition which had not hitherto been tried, and concerning which, the public opinion was therefore more difficult to a&s;certain. It derived a con&s;iderable part of its force from, and depended, in a great mea&s;ure, for its &s;ucce&s;s, on a combination of circum|&s;tances peculiar to that time. That exotic &s;pecies of entertainment called Italian Operas, had for &s;everal years been ri&s;ing into fa&s;hion, and at that time entirely engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the higher and more fa&s;hionable ranks of people. The &s;eduction of foreign mu&s;ic, the novelty of tho&s;e unnatural warblers then imported, the charms of dancing, with the glare of decorations, had bewitched the fancy, and diverted the tide of encouragement, and applau&s;e, from the more
<PB N="41" REF="70">
rational, though le&s;s gaudy repre&s;entations of the Engli&s;h theatre. This corruption of public ta&s;te, and perver&s;ion of judgment, it was Mr. Gay's intention, by humorou&s;ly &s;atirizing, to correct. The &s;ame loftine&s;s of &s;tile, and unnece&s;&s;ary &s;low of forced &s;imiles, which, from an Italian hero, gave &s;uch delight, when put into the mouths of &s;harpers and highwaymen, could not fail to pro|duce an effect as ludicrous, as the former had been grand. But though the de&s;ign of this piece was excellent, and the execution ma&s;terly, not|with&s;tanding it was in every re&s;pect nouvelle, yet were the managers ju&s;tifiable in their unwil|lingne&s;s to hazard a production, the boldne&s;s of which, though in ca&s;e fortune was favourable, it might heighten its &s;ucce&s;s, would, if matters took an adver&s;e turn, but render its fall more &s;evere.</P>
<P>Happily for the commonwealth of letters, the event proved their fears ill-grounded, and a long experience has &s;hewn us, that independent of tho&s;e local temporary &s;trokes which attended its origin, the Beggars Opera has &s;ufficient &s;terling merit to rank with the fir&s;t dramatic pieces in the Engli&s;h language, and to en&s;ure its &s;ucce&s;s at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="71">The managers were, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;o far right in their judgment of the town, that on the fir&s;t night, for a con&s;iderable time, the re|ception was doubtful. The fir&s;t act pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ilent attention; not a hand moved, its origi|nality &s;urpri&s;ed them. At its conclu&s;ion, the audience ro&s;e, and every man, fearful of his own judgment, &s;eemed eager to learn that of his neighbour. The re&s;ult however, was gene|rally in its favour. In the &s;econd act they began to reli&s;h its &s;atire, and di&s;cover its beauties: they then broke &s;ilence, and gave &s;everal marks of their approbation, to the great joy of the anxious author, and di&s;heartened performers. The la&s;t act was received with univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>Such was the fir&s;t reception of a piece which will keep its place on the &s;tage, as long as the &s;tage exi&s;ts. It was performed &s;ixty-three nights the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and its fame quickly reached this kingdom, where it experienced, every thing con&s;idered, equal &s;ucce&s;s; for we find it adverti&s;ed for the benefit of Mr. Vanderbank, a favourite comedian, December 28th 1728, for the fortieth time, independent of the many nights it was exhibited by Madam Violante's
<PB N="43" REF="72">
Lilliputian Company, of whom, more here|after.</P>
<P>The very different fates of the original Mac|heath and Polly, have never, I believe, been noticed as they de&s;erve. Mr. Walker, the original Macheath, though a good actor, and rai&s;ed by his performance of &s;o popular a cha|racter, to the highe&s;t reputation, yet, for want of proper conduct, and through an immoderate attachment to liquor, died, many years after, neglected and for&s;aken; whil&s;t Mi&s;s Fenton, the celebrated Polly, ro&s;e to the di&s;tingui&s;hed rank of Duche&s;s of Bolton, which celebrated &s;tation &s;he &s;upported with the love and admira|tion of all.</P>
<P>In the year 1730, the tragedy of George Barnwell was brought out at the Theatre Royal, Covent-garden. The reception of this piece was al&s;o attended with &s;everal &s;ingular circum&s;tances which de&s;erve particular mention. Mr. George Lillo, the author, was born February 4th 1693, in the neighbourhood of Moorfields. His edu|cation, we may &s;uppo&s;e, was rather limited, as he was bred a jeweller. But he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed what was infinitely more valuable, the &s;eeds of
<PB N="44" REF="73">
genius, which time ripened and brought to ma|turity. His life was, like his writings, an in|&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to mankind. Strongly attached to the mu&s;es, he laid it down as a fundamental rule, that they ought always to be made &s;ub|&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of virtue and religion. He was peculiarly happy in the choice of his &s;ub|jects, and his management of them was no le&s;s meritorious. His pathos, irre&s;i&s;tibly took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and he had the art of working up the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of common and dome&s;|tic life &s;o judiciou&s;ly, that they became more intere&s;ting to the audience, than tho&s;e of kings and princes. It may with truth be averred, that George Barnwell has drawn more tears than the pompous tragedies of Alexander the Great, All for Love, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Popular prejudice ran high again&s;t this play, previous to its repre&s;entation. Every one knew it to be founded on a well-known ancient ballad, and &s;o contemptible an opinion did the critics entertain of it, that on its fir&s;t night, thou&s;ands of the original old ballad were purcha&s;ed, in order to divert them&s;elves by drawing compa|ri&s;ons, and turning the whole into ridicule. But the&s;e all-wi&s;e gentlemen were highly di&s;|appointed;
<PB N="45" REF="74">
the merit of the play conquered their prejudices, it pre&s;ented them with &s;cenes written &s;o truly to the heart, that they were compelled to &s;ub&s;cribe to their power, and drop their ballads to take up their handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>Its &s;ucce&s;s in London was equal to its acknow|ledged merit, and it continued to draw crouded hou&s;es for many nights. At the commencement of the &s;ea&s;on, September 1731, it was got up in Dublin, and honoured on its fir&s;t night with the pre&s;ence of his grace the duke of Dor&s;et, then lord lieutenant, when it met with great applau&s;e, and for many years maintained a di&s;|tingui&s;hed rank on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject, I cannot help men|tioning two anecdotes relative to effects pro|duced by this tragedy. The fir&s;t is related by Dr. Barrowby, a gentleman of veracity, of a youth an apprentice to an eminent merchant in London, who forcibly &s;truck by the fate of the unhappy Barnwell, confe&s;&s;ed, that being &s;educed by the arts of a wicked woman, he had robbed his ma&s;ter; how far his guilt might have extend|ed, he &s;huddered to think; but fortunately their commerce was totally put a &s;top to by his
<PB N="46" REF="75">
accidentally &s;eeing the above play. The doctor adds, that upon a proper repre&s;entation of the whole to his ma&s;ter, he not only forgave him, but re&s;tored him to favour. Thus re&s;cued from the paths of de&s;truction, he afterwards became a valuable member of the community.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar in&s;tance is mentioned &s;ince that time, which the pre&s;ent Mr. Ro&s;s, I am told, can atte&s;t. He, if I am rightly informed, for many years regularly received a pre&s;ent of twenty guineas from a gentleman, an entire &s;tranger to him, who&s;e apprentice had happily been reformed by &s;eeing him in the character of George Barnwell. The worthy author of this tragedy wrote &s;everal other dramatic pieces, and died September 3d, 1739, in the 47th year of his age, univer&s;ally beloved and lamented. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that for many years pa&s;t, this excellent tragedy has grown unfa&s;hionable, and given place to many not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half its merit.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here return back a few years to have an opportunity of introducing to my readers, a lady, who &s;ome time after, laid the &s;tronge&s;t claim to their admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="76">The date of Madam Violante's arrival in this kingdom, and opening a theatrical booth in George's-lane, has hitherto been fixed to the year 1731. It is rather &s;urpri&s;ing that tho&s;e who wrote &s;o near that period &s;hould not be better informed. From the mo&s;t authentic informa|tion I find, that this enterprizing lady, four years before, in 1727, engaged a very large hou&s;e for|merly occupied by lord chief ju&s;tice Whitchel, in Fownes's-court, on the &s;pot where Fownes's-&s;treet has &s;ince been built. This hou&s;e was well adapted to her purpo&s;e, it was uncommonly roomy and covered a large extent of ground. Behind it a &s;pacious garden reached to where Crow-&s;treet theatre now &s;tands. This hou&s;e &s;he converted into a commodious booth, and brought over a company of tumblers and rope-dancers, who exhibited for &s;ome time with &s;ucce&s;s. In the&s;e performances Madam Violante bore a prin|cipal part, having been bred a very capital dancer. But, as in all public &s;pectacles, where the mind is not fea&s;ted, the eye &s;oon grows weary and palled, &s;o in this ca&s;e, her audiences in a &s;hort time decrea&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he, fertile in ex|pedients, converted her booth into a play-hou&s;e, and performed plays and farces.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="77">Fortune, who delights in &s;porting with man|kind, and often calls her favourites from the mo&s;t unlikely &s;ituations, &s;eemed to have taken this &s;pot under her peculiar care; for in this little theatre were &s;own tho&s;e &s;eeds of theatric genius, which afterwards flouri&s;hed and delighted the world. Madam Violante finding her efforts in exhibit|ing plays to fail, owing to the badne&s;s of the actors, formed a company of children, the elde&s;t not above ten years of age. The&s;e &s;he in&s;truct|ed in &s;everal petit pieces, and as the Beggars Opera was then in high e&s;timation, &s;he perfected her Lilliputian troop in it, and having prepared proper &s;cenery, dre&s;&s;es, and decorations, &s;he brought it out before it had been &s;een in Dub|lin. The novelty of the &s;ight, the uncommon abilities of the&s;e little performers, and the great merit of the piece, attracted the notice of the town to an extraordinary degree. They drew crouded hou&s;es for a con&s;iderable length of time, and the children of Shake&s;peare's and John&s;on's day, were not more followed, or admired, than tho&s;e tiny geniu&s;es.</P>
<P>Time, the true touch&s;tone of merit, afterwards proved that the public were not mi&s;taken in their judgment. I never have been able to obtain a

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT the year 1728, the Dublin theatre received a very material acqui&s;ition in the per&s;on of Mr. Dennis Delane. This young gentleman was a native of Ireland, de&s;cended from an an|cient and re&s;pectable family. He received a liberal education in Trinity College, Dublin, a &s;eminary which not only produced many men of the greate&s;t learning and abilities, but has al&s;o furni&s;hed &s;ome of the brighte&s;t luminaries of the Iri&s;h theatre. Mr. Delane made his fir&s;t ap|pearance under Mr. Elrington on the Dublin &s;tage, and met with a very favourable recep|tion. He was young, hand&s;ome, had an elegant figure, a powerful voice, a plea&s;ing addre&s;s, and
<PB N="52" REF="81">
tolerably ea&s;y action. He was &s;ometimes de|ficient in judgment, but with the million, this was ea&s;ily overlooked, and as his years encrea&s;ed, his judgment ripened. In many parts in tragedy, particularly Alexander, he was e&s;teemed to have great merit. In comedy he performed the lovers, e&s;pecially Young Bevil, with &s;ucce&s;s. With &s;uch requi&s;ites he &s;oon grew a great favourite with the public, and while he continued in this king|dom, &s;upported a large ca&s;t of capital characters with great reputation. At length in the year 1731, being offered extraordinary high terms from Mr. Giffard, of Goodman's-fields, he left Ireland, and enli&s;ted under his banners. He &s;oon after appeared with great eclat at that theatre, and proved a very powerful competitor again&s;t Quin, then in his meridian, it is &s;aid that Mr. Quin, &s;en&s;ible of his great merit, pre|vailed on him to quit that ob&s;cure part of the town, and generou&s;ly divided the bu&s;ine&s;s with him&s;elf. This, if true, was a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which de&s;erves remembrance. We afterwards find him making &s;ummer excur&s;ions to his native country, where he had a &s;mall paternal e&s;tate, and drawing crouded hou&s;es at &s;uch times, in Dublin.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="82">As Mr. Elrington's company, during the time Mr. Delane continued in it, &s;eemed to undergo very little alteration, I &s;hall beg leave to pre&s;ent my readers with a bill of one of their, fulle&s;t plays, a method, in my opinion, more likely to convey information, than whole pages of de&s;crip|tion; and which I &s;hall take the liberty to adopt at every period, where change of performers may render &s;uch information nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THEATRE ROYAL.

<P>We may &s;ee by the above, that long bills and a quantum &s;ufficit of puffing, were con&s;idered then as well as now, nece&s;&s;ary ingredients to|wards a benefit bill. Mr. and Mrs. Ward, were per&s;ons of con&s;iderable merit, and a very &s;hort time after the above benefit, on &s;ome occa&s;ion, which we at pre&s;ent are ignorant of, revolted from the company, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the booth in Fownes's-court, lately occupied by Madam Violante, who had removed to George's-lane. There they had another benefit, the Double Dealer, May the 5th, 1731, and at the
<PB N="56" REF="85">
bottom of their adverti&s;ement appeared the fol|lowing paragraph, <Q>We are informed, that a great number of ladies and gentlemen have be&s;poke this play, and that the town in general appear ready and willing to encourage our young comedians who have &s;o &s;eparated them|&s;elves from the theatre-royal.</Q></P>
<P>This oppo&s;ition however did very little injury to Mr. Elrington. A few months put a period to it, and we only find this theatre occa&s;ionally opened afterwards.</P>
<P>Ma&s;onry, that cement of &s;ociety, and mo&s;t benevolent of all human in&s;titutions, that divine emanation of love which unites all mankind in the brotherly bands of affection, had, in this kingdom, through &s;ome unaccountable neglect, been &s;uffered for many years to lie buried in the &s;hade of ob&s;curity, and its excellent precepts to remain untaught. About this time, however, the clouds which over&s;hadowed it pa&s;&s;ed away, and its refulgent brightne&s;s broke forth to cheer and illuminate the world; &s;everal lodges which had lain dormant, were revived, and &s;everal new ones con&s;tituted. As it needed only to be known to be admired, many of the fir&s;t charac|ters
<PB N="57" REF="86">
in the nation, on its revival, pre&s;&s;ed for|ward, and reque&s;ted to be admitted members of this ancient, and honourable &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many good effects ari&s;ing from a renovation of this in&s;titution, the theatre expe|rienced its &s;hare. Ma&s;ons are, in general, warm friends of the drama, which they deem e&s;&s;ential to the cau&s;e of virtue; and, as charity is one of their leading principles, they con&s;tantly devote the profits ari&s;ing from one night's performance at the theatre every &s;ea&s;on towards the relief of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and indigent brethren. At this time however, in 1731, their laudable zeal carried them &s;o far, as to make them be&s;peak the tragedy of Cato, then remarkably popular, the male characters of which were all performed by gen|tlemen ma&s;ons: the prices were advanced, and &s;o crowded or brilliant an audience had never, at that time, been &s;een in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Griffith, an excellent actor, and much e&s;teemed by the public, was at this period &s;ecretary to the grand lodge, and greatly be|loved by the brotherhood; his benefits were, in con&s;equence, con&s;tantly be&s;poke by the grand ma&s;ter, who, attended by the brethren, always
<PB N="58" REF="87">
walked in proce&s;&s;ion to the theatre, and &s;at on the &s;tage tho&s;e nights. This circum&s;tance en&s;ured him a full hou&s;e, from which, and his gold tickets, he reaped great emolument.</P>
<P>As this gentleman bore a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the tran&s;actions of the theatre for many years, and was one of its greate&s;t ornaments, the reader may, perhaps, deem &s;ome account of him nece&s;&s;ary. Thomas Griffith, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was de|&s;cended from an ancient, and re&s;pectable family in Wales. Unavoidable misfortunes obliged his parents to &s;ettle in Dublin, where he was born in the year 1680. He received a liberal education, though afterwards bound apprentice to a mathematical-in&s;trument-maker; but his lively genius &s;oon grew di&s;gu&s;ted with his &s;hac|kles, and de&s;pi&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s he was condemned to. The theatre appeared to him an ample field for his abilities, and he re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of a&s;toni&s;hing the world with his uncommon talents. Had his boyi&s;h vanity gone no further, it would have been well; but captivated by the charms of a young actre&s;s who&s;e name has not reached us, he very imprudently married her before he had &s;erved three years of his apprentice&s;hip. The
<PB N="59" REF="88">
con&s;equence was, his parents were obliged to buy the remainder of his time, and our young gentleman was rendered completely happy by being permitted to become actor under Mr. A&s;hbury, who engaged him at a very low &s;alary.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, on his commencing actor, he contracted a friend&s;hip with Mr. Wilkes, which remained in full force till the death of that excellent comedian put a period to it. Though Mr. Griffith was then very young, Mr. Wilkes took him to London, and had him engaged for that &s;ea&s;on at a &s;mall &s;alary. Chet|wood relates, that the Indian Emperor being ordered on a &s;udden to be played, the part of Pizarro, a Spaniard, was wanting, which, with &s;ome difficulty, Mr. Griffith procured. Mr. Betterton, being a little indi&s;po&s;ed, would not venture out to rehear&s;al, for fear of increa&s;ing his indi&s;po&s;ition, to the di&s;appointment of the audience. He, therefore, had not an opportunity of &s;eeing our young gentleman rehear&s;e; but when at night, he came ready at the entrance, his ears were pierced with a voice not familiar to him, and ca&s;ting his eyes upon the &s;tage, he beheld the diminutive Pizarro with a truncheon as long as him&s;elf. A&s;toni&s;hed at his figure, he
<PB N="60" REF="89">
went up to old Downs, the prompter, and cry'd, Zounds! Downs, what &s;ucking Scara|mouch have you &s;ent on there? O Sir, replied Downs, he is good enough for a Spaniard, the part is &s;mall. Betterton replied, If he had made his eyebrows his whi&s;kers, and each whi&s;ker a line, the part would have been two lines too much for &s;uch a monkey in bu&s;kins. Poor Griffith, who &s;tood on the &s;tage, near the door, heard every &s;yllable of this &s;hort dialogue, and by his fears knew who was meant by it; but happily for him, he had no more to &s;peak in that &s;cene. When the fir&s;t act was over, he went to make his excu&s;e to Betterton, and &s;aid, Indeed Sir, I had not taken the part, but that there was only I alone out of the play. I! I! replied Betterton, with a &s;mile, thou art but the tittle of an I; after this night let me never &s;ee a trun|cheon in thy hand again, unle&s;s to &s;tir the &s;ire. Griffith took his advice, laid a&s;ide the bu&s;kin and embraced the &s;ock, in which his light figure, plea&s;ing addre&s;s, and piercing eye, were of con|&s;iderable advantage.</P>
<P>His &s;tay in London was very &s;hort, not liking his &s;ituation, he embraced an offer made him by Mr. A&s;hbury, and returned to his native country.
<PB N="61" REF="90">
Here his abilities had full &s;cope, and he &s;up|ported a very exten&s;ive li&s;t of characters in the comedies of that time with great reputation. In this &s;tation, his wit and humour gained him many friends of the fir&s;t rank and quality; among&s;t the re&s;t, lord Southwell, in the year 1710, gave him a lucrative po&s;t in the revenue, which he enjoyed till his death. He u&s;ed often to ridicule his own &s;mall figure, and in a bill of the mock tragedy of Alexander, he was always adverti&s;ed thus:&mdash;<HI>The Part of Alexander the Great,</HI> to be performed by <HI>little Griffith.</HI></P>
<P>But to return: The new Mu&s;ic-hall in Crow-&s;treet, as it was then called, being ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and fitted up in an elegant manner, Mr. Griffith, joined by a Mr. Whyte from England, opened it with a ridotto, November 30th 1731, in a very &s;uperb &s;tyle, at which mo&s;t of the nobility and gentry in Dublin were pre&s;ent. Entertain|ments of that kind had then &s;eldom been &s;een in Ireland, and under their management were often repeated with &s;ucce&s;s. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ea&s;on, 1731, a new tragedy, called Love and Ambition, written by James Darcy, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was brought out to a very &s;plendid and numerous audience; the duke of Dor&s;et honoured it with
<PB N="62" REF="91">
his pre&s;ence the fir&s;t night, when it was re|ceived with great applau&s;e. However, it had not intrin&s;ic merit to &s;upport it on the &s;tage, &s;o after it had been repeated a few times, and the author had a benefit, by which he reaped con|&s;iderable emolument, it was con&s;igned to ob|livion; it was afterwards printed, but at this time is not ea&s;ily to be met with.</P>
<P>The &s;tage had now attained a mo&s;t re&s;pectable eminence. Its profe&s;&s;ors were held in e&s;tima|tion, and their company courted. The manager was, mo&s;t de&s;ervedly, e&s;teemed and care&s;&s;ed by all the nobility and gentry. His grace the duke of Dor&s;et, then lord-lieutenant, was remarkably fond of the drama, and a princely encourager of it; he commanded plays once or twice a week con&s;tantly, and was &s;o well beloved, that his pre&s;ence always occa&s;ioned a full hou&s;e; he was extremely partial to Mr. Elrington, who u&s;ed often to attend his levee, and his grace was pre&s;ent at &s;everal entertainments which he gave at the Cloy&s;ters, on the Inns-quay, to the lord chancellor, judges, and gentlemen of the law, as &s;teward of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="92">This plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, however, was of a very &s;hort continuance; the en&s;uing year was marked by the death of that great &s;upport and &s;oul of the &s;tage, Mr. Elrington. The la&s;t cha|racter he performed was Lord Townly, in the Provoked Hu&s;band, for the benefit of Mr. Vanderbank, an old actor of reputation; this was on the 26th of June, 1732. Shortly after, as he was con&s;ulting with an architect on a plan for building a new theatre in Aungier-&s;treet, then in agitation, he was &s;uddenly taken ill, and obliged to return home to his hou&s;e in Drum|condra-lane. His di&s;order increa&s;ing, turned to a malignant fever, of which he expired on Saturday July 22d, 1732, aged 44 years.</P>
<P>This excellent actor, who was de&s;cended from a good family, was born in London, June 1688. Being a younger brother of a numerous offspring, his father bound him apprentice to an eminent uphol&s;terer in Covent-garden, where Chetwood, from whom we have &s;everal of the following anecdotes, became acquainted with him. He early di&s;covered an inclination to the drama, and whil&s;t an apprentice performed in &s;everal private plays. Once, when he was pre|paring to act in Sophoni&s;ba, or Hannibal's Over|throw,
<PB N="64" REF="93">
after Chetwood had written out the part of Ma&s;&s;ina, he came with the book to Elring|ton, to &s;tudy his part of Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a; he found him fini&s;hing a velvet cu&s;hion, and gave him the book, but, alas! before he could &s;ecrete it, his ma&s;ter, a hot, voluble Frenchman, came in upon them, and the book was ha&s;tily thru&s;t under the velvet into the cu&s;hion; his ma&s;ter, as u&s;ual, rated him for idling his time, with a Morblieu! You Tom! why you not vark! Tom? and &s;tood over him &s;o long, that to their utter mortification they &s;aw the book irrecoverably &s;titched up in the velvet, never to be retrieved till the cu&s;hion was worn to pieces. Poor El|rington ca&s;t many a de&s;ponding look on Chet|wood while he was fini&s;hing the fate of Sopho|ni&s;ba; every &s;titch went to their hearts. But the play was gone for ever.</P>
<P>Another time, they were &s;o bold as to attempt the tragedy of Hamlet, where young Elrington had the part of the Gho&s;t, and for the purpo&s;e had procured a &s;uit of armour made of pa&s;te|board, and neatly painted. The Frenchman however, had intelligence of the whole, and to their great &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, made one of the audience. The Gho&s;t on his fir&s;t appear|ance
<PB N="65" REF="94">
being dumb, the Frenchman only muttered between his teeth, and they were in hopes his pa&s;&s;ion would &s;ub&s;ide. But when he began his fir&s;t &s;peech to Hamlet, <HI>"Mark me!"</HI> he replied, <HI>"Begar, me vil marke you pre&s;ently!"</HI> and without any further ceremony, beat our poor Gho&s;t off the &s;tage, through the &s;treets, while every &s;troke on the pa&s;teboard armour grieved the auditors, in&s;omuch, that three or four ran after the Gho&s;t, and brought him back in triumph with the avenging Frenchman at his heels, who would not be appea&s;ed, till our Gho&s;t promi&s;ed him never to commit the offence of acting again; a promi&s;e made, like many others, without an intention of keeping. However, in the la&s;t year of his time, through the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome friends, his rigid ma&s;ter gave him a little more liberty, and our young actor played many parts with &s;uch applau&s;e, that he was at length taken notice of by Mr. Keene, an excellent performer at that time, who introduced him upon the &s;tage in the part of Oroonoko, in the year 1711, where he met with &s;o favourable a reception as to fix his future pur&s;uits in life.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="95">The next &s;ea&s;on he was invited to Ireland by Mr. A&s;hbury, where he &s;ucceeded equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, and before he had been twelve months in that kingdom, &s;o far had he ingratiated him&s;elf into the good graces of Mr. A&s;hbury and his family, that he gave him his only daughter in marriage. With this lady he lived happily many years, and had a numerous i&s;&s;ue: two of his &s;ons Jo&s;eph and Richard went on the &s;tage, but had not abilities equal to the father. Thomas Elrington the younger, was a lieutenant in colonel Flemming's regiment, and afterwards married a lady of great fortune in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Mr. Elrington was an excellent figure, tall and well proportioned, his voice was manly, &s;trong, &s;weet, and full-toned, his action ea&s;y and graceful. He copied with &s;ucce&s;s, Mr. Verbruggen, one of the be&s;t actors of his time in tragedy and genteel comedy. Elrington's Oroonoko was one of the fir&s;t pieces of acting ever &s;een. In his &s;urpri&s;e on unexpectedly meeting with Imoinda, a &s;ituation which calls for an actor of the greate&s;t genius, he charmed all who &s;aw his action, and heard his expre&s;&s;ion. Davies &s;ays, he has heard Mr. Macklin &s;peak of
<PB N="67" REF="96">
Elrington's excellence in this &s;cene with rapture. Barry him&s;elf was not equally happy in this &s;u|perior lover. Mr. Elrington was al&s;o in Bajazet a fine copy of Verbruggen. When the ma|nagers of Drury-lane gave Bajazet to Elrington in preference to John Mills, the latter com|plained to Booth of his di&s;grace: Booth in re|turn told him, that Elrington would make nine &s;uch actors as Mills.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Elrington was rapidly ri&s;ing in the e&s;timation of all who &s;aw him at Drury-lane, and had played many characters of con&s;e|quence with great reputation; yet we are told, that Cibber either could not or would not &s;ee his merit. Elrington after he had been a &s;hort time on the &s;tage, wi&s;hed much to play the part of Torri&s;mond in the Spani&s;h Fryar; this reque&s;t Cibber oppo&s;ed with all his might. A nobleman of great eminence, and a particular friend of Elrington's, intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o far, as to &s;end for Cibber, whom he de&s;ired to give his rea&s;ons for not permitting the young player to try his abilities in a favourite part; <Q>My lord,</Q> &s;aid Cibber, <Q>it is not with us as with you; your lord&s;hip is &s;en&s;ible that there is no difficulty in filling places at court; you can|not

<P>Repeated mortifications of this kind indu|ced Mr. Elrington to li&s;ten to the overtures of Mr. A&s;hbury, who&s;e judgment could ea&s;ily di&s;cern the extraordinary abilities and ri&s;ing genius of our young hero. The event fully ju&s;tified his choice. He performed many years in Dublin with the highe&s;t reputation, and when invited over to London, on account of Booth's indi&s;po&s;ition in 1729, was the great &s;upport of Drury-lane theatre. The managers were &s;o well convinced of his importance to them, that they offered him his own conditions, if he would en|gage with them for a term of years. To this, Mr. Elrington with great mode&s;ty replied; "I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the value of your offer, but in Ireland I am &s;o well rewarded for my &s;ervices, that I cannot think of leaving it for any con&s;ideration." "There is not," added he, "a gentleman's hou&s;e in that kingdom to which I am not a welcome vi&s;itant," this was an un|doubted truth, as few per&s;ons in Dublin ever

<P>"Thomas Elrington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was for near twenty years the ornament and delight of the Iri&s;h &s;tage.

Nature cer|tainly formed him an actor, and to his amazing genius for repre&s;enting &s;uch a variety of contrary characters, gave him a voice and per&s;on &s;carce ever equalled, and never excelled by any of his cotemporaries, or predece&s;&s;ors on the &s;tage: and it is to be feared, will never be rivaled by any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Precipitate decline of the theatre.&mdash;F. Elrington, Griffith, and Layfield, managers.&mdash;Di&s;tre&s;t Mother acted at the Ca&s;tle.&mdash;Madam Violante lets her theatre to Sparks, Barrington, and Mi&s;s Mackay. &mdash; Shut up by the Lord Mayor. &mdash;Rainsford-&s;treet Theatre built.&mdash;Delane and Ryan vi&s;it Ireland.&mdash;Account of Government Plays.&mdash;Aungier-&s;treet opened.&mdash; Mr. Swan, manager.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE death of Mr. Elrington was a &s;evere blow to the intere&s;ts of the drama in Ireland, and the &s;tage began to decline rapidly. The reader perhaps can &s;carcely imagine, that at this time, though not much above fifty years ago, our theatrical hi&s;tory is &s;o much involved in ob&s;curity, that it is no ea&s;y talk to clear it up. The management as well as I can learn, de|volved to Mr. Francis Elrington, brother to the late manager, in conjunction with Mr. Griffith, Mr. Layfield, and &s;ome others who&s;e names have not reached us.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="101">Of Mr. Griffith I have &s;poken already. The little that we know of Mr. Francis Elrington is, that he was born in London in the year 1692, that he held a &s;mall po&s;t in the wardrobe, under his grace the duke of Montague, when hearing of the great &s;ucce&s;s of his brother in Ireland, he gave it up, and re&s;olved to court his for|tune on the &s;tage in that kingdom. Though his abilities were not in any re&s;pect equal to tho&s;e of his brothers, yet were they by no means below mediocrity. His figure was good, and his voice agreeable. What he wanted in judgment, he endeavoured to make up by ob&s;ervation, and a&s;&s;iduity, and for many years the public re|ceived him with plea&s;ure in a variety of capital characters in tragedy and comedy. His grace the duke of Dor&s;et, a &s;teady friend to the family, when lord-lieutenant of Ireland, gave him a place in the revenue, which he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>Mr. Lewis Layfield was an Engli&s;h gentle|man, who we are told had been in many em|ployments both by &s;ea and land. As an actor, he had a con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit, his fir&s;t appearance I believe was at Drury-lane. At the time I am now &s;peaking of, he was advanced
<PB N="73" REF="102">
in years, and had for &s;ome time been a member of the Dublin theatre.</P>
<P>A theatrical &s;tate will not, in my opinion, admit of a multiplicity of rulers, and is never &s;o well governed as by one. Different tem|pers &s;eldom accord, and though the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal parties &s;hould tend to the &s;ame points, yet frequently their prejudices or their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions prevent them from pur&s;uing proper directions. It cannot indeed from the nature of the &s;ubject be expected, that &s;everal di&s;tinct and independent ab&s;olute powers, &s;hould long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in harmony together, and experience &s;hews us that &s;uch connexions &s;erve to divide and impair, rather than to unite and &s;trengthen. The management of Cibber, Wilkes, and Dogget, and afterwards (on his &s;elling out) of Booth, may, I know, be urged as an exception. But let me a&s;k, where &s;hall we find &s;uch another triumvirate? yet, even among&s;t them there was not peace or unanimity; and I cannot help re|marking here, that Cibber's portraits of his part|ners as drawn in his apology, do little honour to his heart, and are la&s;ting &s;tains on his memory.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="103">How far the theatrical partners abovemen|tioned agreed, I cannot, at this time pretend to &s;ay; but this much evidently appears, that, whe|ther from want of judgment or conduct, or other cau&s;es unknown to us, the affairs of the theatre &s;oon began to wear an unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect. Neverthele&s;s, at fir&s;t, they proceeded with &s;pirit; they engaged &s;everal new actors and actre&s;&s;es, and having repaired and beautified Smock-alley theatre which began to decay, they opened the 5th of the en&s;uing October 1732, with the I&s;land Prince&s;s, an opera by Motteaux, founded on a piece of the &s;ame name written by Flet|cher. On this occa&s;ion &s;everal new &s;cenes were painted, and a great deal of machinery incidental to the opera exhibited.</P>
<P>From the following circum&s;tance we may &s;uppo&s;e that the wardrobe of the theatre was not then in the mo&s;t &s;plendid condition. In Faulk|ner's Journal of 1732, we meet with this curious paragraph, <Q>The Rt. Hon. Lord Mountca&s;hel has made a pre&s;ent to &s;ome of our managers of five &s;uits of the fine&s;t laced and em|broidered cloaths that ever were &s;een on any &s;tage.</Q>&mdash;And again December 30th, <Q>The fine cloaths lately given by the Right Hon.
<PB N="75" REF="104">
Lord Vi&s;count Mountca&s;hel, were for the u&s;e of the whole company, and it is hoped our nobility and gentry will follow that noble and generous example.</Q></P>
<P>About the year 1730, Madam Violante, whom I formerly mentioned, removed from the booth &s;he occupied in Fownes's-court, to one more commodious in George's-lane, where her Lil|liputian company, &s;till in great e&s;timation, ac|companied her. Here &s;he continued to exhibit dramatic entertainments with pantomimes, tumbling and rope-dancing for &s;ome time with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>We have every rea&s;on to imagine that the public, were at this time uncommonly fond of dramatic repre&s;entations. I have before men|tioned the great &s;upport the duke of Dor&s;et gave the &s;tage whil&s;t lord-lieutenant. Private playing was al&s;o much in fa&s;hion. In January 1732-3, the Di&s;tre&s;t Mother was acted at the council chamber in the Ca&s;tle of Dublin. Lord Vi&s;count Mountjoy, Lord Vi&s;count King&s;land, and other per&s;ons of quality of both &s;exes &s;upported the different characters. The room was fitted up in the mo&s;t elegant &s;tile. All the
<PB N="76" REF="105">
chambers and pa&s;&s;ages were illuminated with wax. There was a crowded audience of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank in the kingdom, and the whole was conducted with the greate&s;t regularity and decorum.</P>
<P>We &s;hould naturally imagine that Dublin at that time was not &s;o populous as to in&s;pire any one with the idea of opening another theatre; and yet we find this was the ca&s;e. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by Chetwood, is, that Madam Violante finding her bu&s;ine&s;s decline, let her theatre to Mr. Luke Sparks, Mr. John Barring|ton, and Mi&s;s Mackay, afterwards Mrs. Mitchell, (three of her young performers) for three pounds per week. No great &s;um, yet as much as they were able to pay. The&s;e young adventurers were joined by &s;everal others whom love of fame, more than hopes of profit, incited. Mr. Sparks as being the olde&s;t, and having played before in a country company, was appointed manager. From &s;uch performers without cloaths or &s;cenes, little could be expected; however, they opened with Farquhar's comedy of</P>
<P>THE INCONSTANT: OR, THE WAY TO WIN HIM.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="106">The three principal parts were played by our three adventurers, viz.</P>

<P>Curio&s;ity induced many to go for a few nights, but that &s;atisfied, the theatre quickly grew de|&s;erted, and the finances of the performers being &s;oon exhau&s;ted, their only re&s;ource was to take benefits. Mi&s;s Mackay, being the heroine and a favourite with the public, re&s;olved to try her fortune fir&s;t. She cho&s;e the Fop's Fortune, and &s;everal ladies and gentlemen intere&s;ting them|&s;elves for her, her hou&s;e amounted to the amaz|ing &s;um of forty pounds!</P>
<P>Trifling as this appears now, it was then of &s;uch con&s;equence and occa&s;ioned &s;uch an alarm to the actors of Smock-alley, that the managers applied to the lord-mayor to interpo&s;e his autho|rity and forbid their acting. This he readily con&s;ented to; they with difficulty obtained leave to play one night more, and fini&s;h with Woman's a Riddle. This &s;uppre&s;&s;ion it &s;eems was much re&s;ented by the public, and gave ri&s;e to the building of Rainsford-&s;treet theatre.</P>

<P>This company was under the direction of Mr. Hu&s;band, an actor of reputation. This gentleman was born in Pembroke&s;hire, January 1672. His ance&s;tors were an ancient and re|putable family long &s;eated in that country. He very early in life attached him&s;elf to the &s;tage, but was upwards of two years before he could gain admi&s;&s;ion. Though his figure was good, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the requi&s;ites to form an actor, yet it was with difficulty he obtained leave to make his fir&s;t appearance in the trifling character of Sir Walter Raleigh in the Earl of E&s;&s;ex. In this, however, he ac|quitted him&s;elf &s;o well that his &s;alary was fixed at ten &s;hillings per week, the then common &s;tipend of young actors. Time at length brought him forward, and he &s;oon got better parts and a greater &s;alary.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="111">In the year 1696, Mr. Dogget, being then in Ireland, recommended Mr. Hu&s;band to Mr. A&s;hbury as a very promi&s;ing young actor. He &s;et out from London in company with Trefu&s;is, an excellent comedian, and embarked for this kingdom, where, after a violent &s;torm at &s;ea, he landed with &s;ome difficulty. He was always well received by the public, and maintained an excellent character. At the time he embarked in this enterprize he was about &s;ixty years of age, rather too late in life. Among&s;t the dra|matis per&s;onae of Love for Love the names of &s;everal per&s;ons of merit appear, particularly Raven&s;croft, Bourne, Sparks, Mrs. Raven&s;croft, Mi&s;s Mackay, Mi&s;s Barnes, and Mrs. Talent.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e time of opening Rainsford-&s;treet theatre has not been recorded, I think it mu&s;t have been the latter end of the year 1732, or early in 1733; for, on February 19th 1733, was exhibited at the new theatre in Rainsford-&s;treet, as it was then called, a new tragedy, called the Fate of Ambition, or the Treacherous Favourite, to a crowded audience. This piece was played a few nights, the author, who&s;e name I cannot learn, had a benefit, and it was then con&s;igned to oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="112">As Smock-alley theatre had, for &s;ome years been in a &s;tate of decay, the late Mr. Elring|ton before his death, formed a de&s;ign of build|ing a new one, on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale than had hitherto been attempted. No &s;ooner were his intentions known, than a very large &s;ub&s;crip|tion was entered into by many noblemen and per&s;ons of rank and quality: in the li&s;t we find the names of men of the fir&s;t fortunes, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed under&s;tandings, who on this occa&s;ion eagerly pre&s;&s;ed forward, fully con|vinced of what great utility to a ri&s;ing nation public amu&s;ements are, when properly con|ducted.</P>
<P>A large lot of ground in Longford-&s;treet, ad|joining Aungier-&s;treet, was purcha&s;ed. In choice of &s;ituation, they &s;eemed to pay more regard to what was then principally the fa&s;hionable end of the town, than to the mercantile or trading part; Dublin &s;ince that time has increa&s;ed amazingly in buildings; almo&s;t a new town has ari&s;en north-ea&s;t of Capel-&s;treet and Bolton-&s;treet, a town which for &s;o much, may vie with mo&s;t in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="113">The death of Mr. Elrington, though it put a &s;top for a while to the de&s;ign, did not prevent its being put in execution. The fir&s;t &s;tone of this new theatre was laid with great pomp and ceremony on Tue&s;day May the 8th, 1733, by the Rt. Hon. Richard Tighe; the &s;econd, by the Hon. General Naper; the third, by William Tighe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the fourth, by the Hon. Sir Edward Loveit Pearce, Knt. &s;urveyor general of his Maje&s;ty's works in Ireland, and architect of the parliament-hou&s;e. Under each &s;tone were placed &s;everal medals &s;truck for the occa&s;ion, by Mr. Griffith, Mr. Elrington, and Mr. Layfield, managers of the old theatre-royal. A prodigious concour&s;e of people was a&s;&s;embled, and each &s;tone was laid with flouri&s;h of trumpets, drums, a band of mu&s;ic, and loud acclamations of the multitude. Plenty of the choice&s;t wines was provided for the gentry by the managers, &s;everal barrels of ale were given to the populace; each of the gentlemen who laid the foundation &s;tones made pre&s;ents to the workmen; after which an elegant dinner was provided by the managers for the nobility and gentry.</P>
<P>After this the company remained playing at Smock-alley till the June following, when Mr.
<PB N="83" REF="114">
Delane and Mr. Ryan arrived from London for the after &s;ea&s;on. Mr. Delane, during the time he had been away, had ri&s;en to the highe&s;t pitch of theatrical reputation. Mr. Ryan had never been in this kingdom before. Their fir&s;t appear|ance was in Macbeth: Macbeth, Mr. Delane; Macduff, Mr. Ryan; Monday June 25th, 1733; they drew a very crouded hou&s;e, and gave great &s;atisfaction. Their next appearance was in the Provoked Hu&s;band: Lord Townly, Mr. Delane; Manly, Mr. Ryan. Their other plays were, the fir&s;t part of Henry the fourth, Hamlet, Othello, Delane's benefit, and the Con&s;tant Couple, for the benefit of Mr. Ryan. As they played but once or twice a week, the&s;e plays kept them till the middle of July, when the company &s;et off for Cork, in which expedition Mr. Delane and Mr. Ryan accompanied them.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on three theatres were open in Dublin: Smock-alley, Rainsford-&s;treet, and Madam Violante's in George's-lane, where plays were exhibited occa|&s;ionally; be&s;ides the celebrated Tony A&s;hton's medley in Patrick's-clo&s;e. This year, al&s;o, a new mu&s;ic-hall in Crow-&s;treet was built, by a Mr. John&s;on, on the ruins of which, in proce&s;s

of time, the pre&s;ent theatre aro&s;e. Here ridottos were performed under the direction of &s;ignior Arrigoni, a very celebrated Italian compo&s;er and performer on the violin.</P>
<P>The company on their return from Cork opened with what is u&s;ually called a government play. As the term may not be under&s;tood by many of my readers, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform them, that the manager of the theatre-royal in Dublin receives &s;uch a certain &s;um annually from government for the performing of plays on par|ticular nights, &s;uch as the King and Queen's birth-day, his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. On the&s;e nights the ladies are always complimented with the freedom of the boxes: this cu&s;tom was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the &s;tage in Ireland.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, they were then in a quite different &s;tyle to what they are at pre&s;ent: from the earlie&s;t time they were con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable nights in the &s;ea&s;on, and con|&s;tantly honoured with the pre&s;ence of the lord lieutenant, or lords ju&s;tices, for the time being; and &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary was the chief gover|nor's appearance deemed on &s;uch occa&s;ions, that November 4th, 1714, the anniver&s;ary of King William the Third's birth-day, the tragedy of
<PB N="85" REF="116">
Tamerlane, always appointed for that evening, was, by command, not to begin till an entertain|ment given by the lord mayor and city, at the thol&s;el, to the lord lieutenant, nobility, and gentry was over, that they might have time to repair from thence to the theatre. The boxes were, as I ob&s;erved, free for the ladies, but only tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank and di&s;tinction ever availed them&s;elves of this compliment.</P>
<P>On the night above-mentioned, November 4th, 1733, the play cho&s;en was Love for Love, per|formed in their be&s;t manner; an occa&s;ional pro|logue was &s;poken by Mr. Griffith, and they were honoured with the pre&s;ence of the Duke and Duche&s;s of Dor&s;et, and a very brilliant audience. The&s;e nights continued fa&s;hionable till Mr. Barry and Woodward's management, when, from what rea&s;on I cannot learn, they began to fall into di&s;repute. For many years pa&s;t they have been, in every re&s;pect, the very rever&s;e of what they were originally intended for, and at pre&s;ent, few per&s;ons of credit re&s;ort to the theatre on &s;uch nights.</P>

<P>Of the above company I cannot &s;ay much in prai&s;e. The Elringtons were the be&s;t of the men, and they &s;u&s;tained the three principal characters. Mr. Griffith, and Mr. Layfield, I have already mentioned. Mr. Vanderbank was an old actor of tolerable reputation. Mrs.

Bellamy was the mother of the celebrated actre&s;s of that name, &s;he was an excellent figure, but had not many abilities for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The expectations of the public were rai&s;ed very high re&s;pecting this new theatre. The duke and duche&s;s of Dor&s;et graced its opening with their pre&s;ence, and the hou&s;e was greatly crowded with nobility and gentry. They &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with the manner in which the in&s;ide of the theatre was laid out, and decorated. The performance was received with much ap|plau&s;e, and every thing wore a plea&s;ing face.</P>
<P>There certainly never was a more noble or di&s;intere&s;ted de&s;ign than that fir&s;t formed of building and conducting this theatre. Its prin|ciples were the mo&s;t liberal and exten&s;ive that can be conceived. The plan at fir&s;t laid down by the &s;ub&s;cribers, if properly carried into execu|tion, would in a &s;hort time have produced the grande&s;t theatrical con&s;titution in the world, even &s;uperior to the boa&s;ted Athenian drama. The proprietors were noblemen and gentlemen of the fir&s;t rank and con&s;equence in the nation, who, actuated by the noble&s;t motives, agreed to &s;uperintend the concerns of the &s;tage, endea|voured

to advance its intere&s;ts, and fix it on the mo&s;t permanent and flouri&s;hing ba&s;is, without the lea&s;t idea of emolument, in return. A committee was cho&s;en from among&s;t them, a chairman appointed, and every Saturday they met to appoint the plays, di&s;tribute the parts, and &s;ettle the great variety of bu&s;ine&s;s, which una|voidably ari&s;es from &s;o great an undertaking. All the profits and emoluments accruing from the performances in&s;tead of going into the pur&s;es of private per&s;ons, were &s;olely to be dedicated to the public &s;ervice. As the &s;cheme extended, the be&s;t performers who could be procured, were to be engaged, pieces of undoubted merit were to be revived and brought forward, the wardrobe and &s;cenery to be enlarged, and every decoration which the hand of ta&s;te could point out, to be adopted to adorn the theatre. Such were the outlines of a de&s;ign which promi&s;ed as &s;plendid dramatic entertainments as Greece or Rome ever exhibited! How worthy of imitation!</P>
<P>But vain and uncertain are all human pro|jects! Fair and flattering as the pro&s;pect ap|peared, yet &s;trange to relate, the de&s;ign never came to maturity. By what extraordinary
<PB N="89" REF="120">
fatality it failed, I never have been able with certainty to learn. The rea&s;on generally given was that the former managers of Smock-alley who were continued by the proprietors, con|ducted bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o injudiciou&s;ly that they could not lay any claim to encouragement or &s;ucce&s;s. They found that prodigious &s;ums had been ex|pended on a theatre badly con&s;tructed. Expe|rience proved, that the architect failed in the two e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of accommodating it for hearing and &s;eeing. It required uncommon powers of voice to fill every part of the hou&s;e, and on full nights a great part of the people in both galleries could neither hear nor &s;ee, whereas, in a theatre properly de&s;igned, every &s;pectator, though ever &s;o di&s;advantageou&s;ly placed, &s;hould with ea&s;e do both.</P>
<P>The public next ob&s;erved, that the company in general had not merit equal to what they had a right to expect. The novelty of the hou&s;e &s;oon wore off, the attraction of curio&s;ity &s;ub|&s;ided, and by degrees, their audiences grew thin. Another mi&s;take was their appointing a per&s;on almo&s;t unacquainted with theatrical affairs to &s;uperintend the management; this was a Mr. Swan, a gentleman of character and for|tune,
<PB N="90" REF="121">
yet living at York, who was much fitter for the calm &s;cenes of dome&s;tic life, than the bu&s;y bu&s;tling &s;pirit &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for a director of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Mr. Swan was long attached to the drama; he played once for Mr. Wor&s;dale's benefit the part of Tamerlane with &s;o much applau&s;e, that he was tempted to repeat it, and afterwards to per|form Othello and &s;everal other characters with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Swan at that time had an excellent figure, great judgment, and in all probability, had he continued, would have proved a capital actor. A per&s;on of di&s;tinction once a&s;ked an actor his opinion of Mr. Swan's per|formance, who replied, <HI>"He play'd very well as a gentleman." "I &s;hould be very glad,"</HI> replied the other, <HI>"to &s;ee you play like him then."</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE rival&s;hip between the two theatres, Aungier-&s;treet and Rainsford-&s;treet, continued with various &s;ucce&s;s. The former had many advantages over the latter which could only be balanced by an unremitting a&s;&s;iduity. Early the en&s;uing winter the managers of Aungier-&s;treet got up Henry the Eighth with the Coronation, at great expence, and with much pomp and parade. This an&s;wered their purpo&s;e. The
<PB N="92" REF="123">
public are ever to be caught by &s;hew and &s;pec|tacle. It drew crowded hou&s;es for many nights, and amply repaid them; while poor Rainsford-&s;treet, which before maintained a tolerable &s;truggle, was now totally neglected.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of invention. Con&s;cious that they had not a capital &s;ufficient to vie with their wealthy competitors in &s;plendor, they judi|ciou&s;ly adopted the only conduct proper on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. What they could not outvie, they endeavoured to throw into ridicule. The Royal Merchant, or the Beggars Bu&s;h, was got up with expedition, and in it they introduced a mock coronation of King Clau&s;e, which had a very great effect. In their mock proce&s;&s;ion every form and minutiae of the other was ob&s;erved, but burle&s;qued to the highe&s;t degree. This &s;ingular exhibition immediately turned the tide of popular curio&s;ity. Poor King Harry was thinly attended, while King Clau&s;e rode tri|umphant &s;eventeen nights, en&s;uring his &s;ubjects wealth and applau&s;e. But novelty is the &s;oul of the theatre; the mo&s;t favourite pieces when often repeated pall and fail in their effect, &s;o in a &s;hort time both their maje&s;ties lo&s;t their at|traction, and poverty the old evil again recurred.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="124">It might naturally be imagined that from the unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect of the two theatres already e&s;tabli&s;hed, none would be &s;o hardy as to think of a third, yet far from being deterred by the&s;e examples, the proprietors of the old theatre in Smock-alley re&s;olved once more to try their fortune. Having &s;trengthened them&s;elves with a few additional &s;ub&s;cribers, they pulled down the old building, and on Monday May 19th 1735, laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the pre&s;ent theatre in Smock-alley with great pomp and ceremony.</P>
<P>Highly alarmed at this unexpected &s;troke, the managers of Aungier-&s;treet, at the clo&s;e of an un&s;ucce&s;sful campaign, engaged Mr. Delane and Mr. Giffard for their later &s;ea&s;on, who after play|ing a few nights proceeded with the company to Carlow races on their road to Cork. During their ab&s;ence, their new antagoni&s;ts &s;eemed to have got forward with uncommon di&s;patch, for in le&s;s than &s;even months from the day the foun|dation of Smock-alley theatre was laid, it was fini&s;hed and played in. Notwith&s;tanding the un|common expedition u&s;ed, the architect &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided the errors and mi&s;takes of former build|ers, and erected a &s;trong, elegant, commodious, well con&s;tructed theatre. The cavea, or au|dience
<PB N="94" REF="125">
part, is remarkably well con&s;tructed for the two fir&s;t requi&s;ites, of &s;eeing and hearing. In the&s;e e&s;&s;entials it gives place to none that ever I &s;aw, and I think I may &s;afely &s;ay is &s;u|perior to mo&s;t. It was opened on Thur&s;day December the 11th 1735, with the comedy of</P>

<P>In the above we find &s;everal good comedians. Mr. and Mrs. Ward, Mr. Sparks, Mr. Barring|ton
<PB N="95" REF="126">
and Mi&s;s Barnes, I have already &s;poken of. Mr. Robert Wetherelt, in the theatrical phra&s;e, may be &s;aid to have been born on the &s;tage, as his father and mother at the time of his birth, 1708, belonged to a country company at Stamford in Lincoln&s;hire; in his early years he belonged to Drury-lane, where he fir&s;t di&s;played his genius in Squire Richard in the Journey to London. From thence he went to Goodman's-fields theatre where he married a &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Delane's. On the new company's being formed at Smock-alley, he was invited over, and made his fir&s;t appear|ance in the above play, when he gave great &s;atisfaction. He &s;pent the remainder of his days in Ireland, e&s;teemed as one of the be&s;t actors of his time. He died in 1743 in the 35th year of his age, much regretted, and was buried in St. Andrew's church-yard. Mr. Oliver Ca&s;hel was an Iri&s;h gentleman of a very ancient and reputable family. He commenced actor much about the time above-mentioned. His figure was agreeable and voice excellent, &s;o that &s;ome years afterwards he played Captain Macheath with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s at Covent-garden as to occa&s;ion it to run for many nights after it had lain dormant for &s;ome years.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="127">This gentleman was &s;uddenly &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s on the &s;tage in the part of Frankly in the Su&s;picious Hu&s;band, at Norwich, and notwith|&s;tanding every remedy and a&s;&s;i&s;tance were ap|plied, expired in a few hours. Mr. Da&s;h and Mr. Bourne were two good comedians, e&s;|pecially the latter. Mi&s;s Boucher I know but little of. Mr. Redman I believe was the &s;ame who for many years afterwards belonged to Covent-garden. Be&s;ides the&s;e were a Mr. Charles Morgan an actor of great merit in low comedy, Mr. John Morris, Mrs. Bullock, natural daughter of Mr. Wilkes, a very good actre&s;s, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Behold three theatres built in Dublin within the &s;pace of five years! Rainsford-&s;treet, Aun|gier-&s;treet, and Smock-alley; not to mention Madam Violante's, and the theatre opened by Ward in Dame-&s;treet. A &s;tranger would be led to imagine from the&s;e circum&s;tances, that its inhabitants were the mo&s;t theatrical in the world, yet the rever&s;e was really the ca&s;e, and the &s;tage was rapidly declining, as the city at that time could not do more than &s;upport one theatre properly.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="128">However the conte&s;t lay principally between Aungier-&s;treet and Smock-alley; as to Rain&s;|ford-&s;treet, it had been for &s;ome time on the decline. Novelty had lo&s;t its force, and its &s;ituation was too remote to be long &s;upported. After this we hear very little concerning it. A play-hou&s;e ought always to be nearly as central as po&s;&s;ible, in order to accommodate all ranks and degrees of people. In this re&s;pect Smock-alley had the advantage of its rival. Aungier-&s;treet &s;till retained its authority of a theatre-royal, whil&s;t the other was opened by a licen&s;e from the Rt. Hon. the Lord-mayor granted to Mr. Lewis Duval the manager, under who&s;e direction it was rebuilt. Both companies continued through the &s;ea&s;on without any material occurrence, with little profit to them&s;elves, or plea&s;ure to the town. At the clo&s;e of it the Aungier-&s;treet company took their u&s;ual route to Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick, whil&s;t Mr. Duval's pur&s;ued an oppo&s;ite direction, and opened at Belfa&s;t, July 16th 1736, with the comedy of the Stra|tagem, at which the earl of Antrim, lord Hill&s;|borough, Clotworthy Skeffington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and many others of the nobility and gentry were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="129">On their return to town, both parties con|tinued their efforts with a variety of &s;ucce&s;s, though Duval &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t in|du&s;trious and fortunate of the two. The Beg|gars Opera was got up for the purpo&s;e of in|troducing Mrs. Reynolds, then famous in the character of Macheath, with Mrs. Hinde in Lucy. Mr. Hinde was the original in the &s;ong of Mad Tom in this kingdom, which he re|peatedly &s;ung on the &s;tage with great applau&s;e. A pantomime called Harlequin Spaniard was exhibited &s;everal nights, and brought tolerable hou&s;es at Smock-alley theatre.</P>
<P>The tragedy of King Charles the Fir&s;t was then performing with great eclat at Lincoln's-inn-fields. Its reputation in London made it a principal object to both theatres here; the moment it was publi&s;hed, copies were &s;ent over, the play was ca&s;t, and put into &s;tudy at both theatres. Duval's however brought it out fir&s;t, and performed it to &s;everal crowded hou&s;es. This popular tragedy was the production of an Iri&s;h pen. The author, Mr. Havard, was born in Dublin, July 1710. His father who was an eminent vintner, gave him a liberal education. He was de&s;igned for the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;urgeon,
<PB N="99" REF="130">
but the &s;tage di&s;played &s;uch charms, and made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his juvenile mind, that early in life he relinqui&s;hed all other pur&s;uits, and before the age of twenty had performed &s;everal characters at Smock-alley theatre with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Ambition, and the hopes of ri&s;ing in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, prompted him to leave Dublin in 1730, and offer his &s;ervices to Mr. Giffard, then ma|nager of Goodman's-fields theatre. Here he was engaged at a very low &s;alary. However, his good &s;en&s;e, gentlene&s;s of manners, and that unoffending behaviour, which marked his cha|racter through life, &s;oon gained him the e&s;teem of the manager and the public.</P>
<P>Shortly after, he produced his tragedy of Scanderberg, which, con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ay of youth, has a tolerable &s;hare of merit. In 1736, his friend&s;hip for Mr. Giffard, then in di&s;tre&s;s, induced him to try the &s;trength of his genius once more. For his &s;ubject he cho&s;e the melancholy &s;tory of king Charles the fir&s;t, com|prehending the trial and principal events relat|ing to the death of that unhappy monarch. Such was his known indolence, and love of ea&s;e,
<PB N="100" REF="131">
that we are informed upon this occa&s;ion, Mr. Giffard in&s;i&s;ted upon the power of keeping him confined under lock and key till the work was completed. This the good-natured author con&s;ented to, and under clo&s;e confinement he remained till the piece was produced.</P>
<P>Whether this bodily re&s;traint had any influence upon his mu&s;e, 'tis hard to determine; thus much mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the language of the play is rather &s;tiff and metaphorical, however, the cha|racters are well drawn and exhibit faithful hi&s;|torical portraits of the men and manners of the times. Peculiarly happy in the choice of his &s;ubject, it was impo&s;&s;ible even for moderate abi|lities not to work up &s;uch intere&s;ting events to &s;ome advantage. Mr. Havard had much merit in this re&s;pect. Few, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lea&s;t &s;park of &s;en&s;ibility, can read the hi&s;torian's relation of the unfortunate prince's taking his la&s;t leave of his children without the utmo&s;t emotion. On the &s;tage its effect was prodigious. And my own ob&s;ervation can ju&s;tify Mr. Davies's remark, that <Q>never were tears &s;o plentifully &s;hed, as at the mournful &s;eparation of Charles and the young princes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="132">Mr. Havard after being near forty years the approved &s;ervant of the public, having attained a moderate competence, and drawing towards the &s;ixtieth year of his age, exchanged the bu&s;tle of the &s;tage for ea&s;e and retirement, in which peaceful &s;ituation he died, much beloved and lamented.</P>
<P>But, to return to my &s;ubject: whether the ta&s;te of the public was palled, or the managers of the two theatres had not judgment &s;ufficient to pro|cure them proper entertainment, is hard to be a&s;certained; certain it is, that every day the &s;tage &s;unk in e&s;timation, and to &s;o low a condition was it now reduced, that when the re&s;pective companies u&s;ed to fini&s;h in Dublin, they gave public notice of going to entertain the ladies and gentlemen at the races of Mullingar, Carlow, Clonmell, &amp;c. nay, Carlow was then thought of &s;uch con&s;equence, that a great contention en&s;ued, and after a vigorous oppo&s;ition the Aungier-&s;treet company got the victory, and obtained leave to perform. This was in Augu&s;t 1737. It was u&s;ual then in Dublin to a&s;&s;ure the public at the bottom of the bills, that they would not di&s;mi&s;s the audience; and among&s;t other curious anecdotes we find at Smock-alley,
<PB N="102" REF="133">
Mrs. Bullock adverti&s;ed for the part of Clari&s;&s;a in the City Wives Confederacy, when they informed the public, that <Q>Mrs. Bullock having performed this part in London for &s;ome years with great applau&s;e, it is thought the play will bring a large audience.</Q></P>
<P>The 30th of November 1737, both theatres were clo&s;ed for &s;ix weeks, by order of the duke of Devon&s;hire, on account of the death of queen Caroline. The poor performers did not want this additional &s;troke of ill fortune at the begin|ning of a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The winter campaigns now &s;eem to furni&s;h very little worth notice. In &s;ummer, they were occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by a few performers of con|&s;equence from London, whom the certainty of good benefits allured. Mr. Delane, Mr. Hal|lam, and Mr. Bridgewater, performed at Smock-alley in June 1737. In June 1739, the cele|brated Mr. Quin, then in the zenith of glory, accompanied by Mr. Giffard, played &s;everal nights at Smock-alley, and drew crowded hou&s;es to their Spani&s;h Fryar, and Torri&s;mond, Cato and Juba, Sir John Brute, and Heartfree, &amp;c. Mr. Quin's benefit was 1261. at that time
<PB N="103" REF="134">
e&s;teemed a great &s;um. In June 1739, Mr. Delane, reinforced with Mr. Millward, revi&s;ited this kingdom, and played a few nights at Smock-alley, where they appeared in Othello and Iago, Tamerlane and Bajazet, Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, Ore&s;tes and Pyrrhus, Bevil jun. and Sealand, &amp;c. Mr. Woodward al&s;o performed for the fir&s;t time in this kingdom at the &s;ame theatre, July 10th 1739, Sir Novelty Fa&s;hion, in Love's La&s;t Shift, with Harlequin in the farce, by the name of Mr. Lun, jun.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing winter brought Mi&s;s Woffington forward to public notice as an actre&s;s. This ce|lebrated character had for &s;ome years quitted Madam Violante's booth, and been engaged at Aungier-&s;treet, where &s;he danced between the acts with Mr. William Delemain, Mon&s;ieur Moreau and others. On February 12th 1736-7, &s;he per|formed the part of Ophelia in Hamlet, being her fir&s;t appearance in a &s;peaking character on that &s;tage. She now began to unveil tho&s;e beauties, and di&s;play tho&s;e graces and accompli&s;hments, which for &s;o many years afterwards charmed mankind. Her ea&s;e, elegance, and &s;implicity, in Polly in the Beggars Opera, with the natural manner of her &s;inging the &s;ongs, plea&s;ed much.
<PB N="104" REF="135">
Her girls were e&s;teemed excellent, and her Mi&s;s Lucy in the Virgin Unma&s;ked, brought hou&s;es. But &s;he never di&s;played her&s;elf to more advan|tage, than in characters where &s;he a&s;&s;umed the other &s;ex. Her figure, which was a model of perfection, then free from re&s;traints, appeared in its natural form. One of the fir&s;t occa&s;ions &s;he had to exhibit it was at her own benefit, when &s;he played Phillis in the Con&s;cious Lovers, and the Female Officer in a farce of that name with great reputation.</P>
<P>As I cannot pur&s;ue any regular order in the relation of the events of this time, I &s;hall ju&s;t throw together a few mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations on matters as they occur. The fir&s;t is, that Mr. Duval, from what rea&s;on I cannot learn, gave up his licen&s;e of acting by permi&s;&s;ion of the lord-mayor, and at the top of the bills at this time we find, By Authority of the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner, E&s;q. December 14th 1739, two new pieces were produced; a tragedy called the Treacherous Hu&s;band, and an opera called Whittington and his Cat; the&s;e were for the benefit of the author, who luckily is not re|corded, nor can I find the pieces ever were re|peated. Nearly in the &s;ame predicament &s;tood

a new tragedy called Tamar Prince of Nubia, written, as the public were then informed, on the late famous revolution in China, by Michael Clancy, M. D.

<P>THE dreadful &s;evere winter in 1739-40, for a long time put a &s;top to all public diver|&s;ions. The poverty and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people at that time can &s;carcely be de|&s;cribed.

Harry Wildair. The novelty of the attempt attracted the notice of all the dramatic connoi&s;|&s;eurs. The hou&s;e was crowded, and &s;o infinitely did &s;he &s;urpa&s;s expectation, that the applau&s;e &s;he received was beyond any at that time ever known. The former &s;tandard for acting the character was Mr. Wilkes. Every one who had attempted it after him fell very far &s;hort. It was re&s;erved for Mi&s;s Woffington to exhibit this elegant portrait of the Young Man of Fa&s;hion in a &s;tile perhaps beyond the author's warme&s;t ideas. Her Sir Harry Wildair was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation in every polite circle and fixed her reputation as an actre&s;s. It was repeated upwards of 20 nights the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and never failed of drawing a mo&s;t brilliant and numerous audience. Mr. Davies places this in 1738. I have undoubted authority for a&s;&s;erting her fir&s;t performance of Sir Harry Wildair was in Dublin, April 1739. I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve that Mr. Davies was often mi&s;informed re&s;pecting the dates of theatrical anecdotes in Ireland, of which I &s;hall produce proofs hereafter. Indeed, in compiling a work &s;o complicated, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid making &s;ome mi&s;takes re|&s;pecting the dates of particular occurrences.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="140">In November 1740, Mr. Duval's company on their return from Drogheda opened at Smock-alley by permi&s;&s;ion of the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner, with the comedy of the Funeral, in which Mrs. Furnival, an actre&s;s of great merit, played Lady Brumpton. Mrs. Furnival, I have been informed by the be&s;t judges, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as great abilities as almo&s;t any actre&s;s that ever appeared. Unhappily &s;he did not cultivate tho&s;e abilities to the be&s;t advantage. She was at this time e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t actre&s;&s;es on the &s;tage, and &s;u&s;tained for many years a great variety of characters, both in tragedy and comedy with reputation.</P>

<P>Amid&s;t this general decline of the &s;tage, the managers of Aungier-&s;treet made an exertion which rou&s;ed the curio&s;ity of the public, and de&s;erves particularly to be noticed. In June 1741 their latter &s;ea&s;on commenced with a bril|liancy never before known in the Iri&s;h dramatic annals. They engaged Mr. Quin then in his
<PB N="113" REF="144">
meridian, Mrs. Clive, Mr. Ryan, and Made|moi&s;elle Chateneuf, then e&s;teemed the be&s;t female dancer in Europe.</P>
<P>Mr. Quin opened in his favourite part of Cato, to as crouded an audience as the theatre could contain. Mrs. Clive next appeared in Lappet in the Mi&s;er; &s;he certainly was one of the be&s;t that ever played it. And Mr. Ryan came forward in Iago to Mr. Quin's Othello. With &s;uch excellent performers, we may natu|rally &s;uppo&s;e the plays were admirably &s;u&s;tained. Perhaps it will &s;carcely be credited that &s;o fini&s;hed a comic actre&s;s as Mrs. Clive could &s;o far mi&s;take her abilities as to play Lady Townly to Mr. Quin's Lord Townly, and Mr. Ryan's Manly. Cordelia to Mr.Quin's Lear, and Ryan's Edgar, &amp;c. However &s;he made ample amends by her performance of Nell, the Virgin Un|ma&s;ked, the Country Wife, and Euphro&s;yne in Comus, which was got up on purpo&s;e, and acted for the fir&s;t time in this kingdom.</P>
<P>The ma&s;que of Comus, though one of the mo&s;t beautiful pieces of poetry in our language, yet requires to be uncommonly &s;upported to render it plea&s;ing to an Engli&s;h audience. But
<PB N="114" REF="145">
in this in&s;tance it was indeed a treat to the ju|dicious. Mr. Quin &s;poke Comus. The Elder Brother was played by Mr. Ryan, Mrs. Clive Euphro&s;yne, and the other characters were di&s;|po&s;ed of with great care and propriety. The celebrated Mr. Duburg prepared the mu&s;ic, Pa&s;quilino led the band, and the dances were executed by Mon&s;ieur Laluze, Mademoi&s;elle Chateneuf and others. This was allowed to be the be&s;t entertainment pre&s;ented to the public for many years, and during the &s;hort time they had to &s;tay, was repeated three times.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Aungier-&s;treet theatre clo&s;ed, Mr. Ryan and Mrs. Clive returned to London. Mr. Quin &s;eems to have attended the company to Cork and Limerick, for we find him the next &s;ea&s;on at Aungier-&s;treet theatre. Mr. Duval went as u&s;ual to Belfa&s;t and Newry.</P>
<P>Both theatres opened the en&s;uing October, and, &s;trange to relate, Mr. Quin's fir&s;t part was Ju&s;tice Balance in the Recruiting Officer, on a government night.</P>
<P>But, as I before ob&s;erved, the be&s;t performers were &s;elected for tho&s;e nights, which were then
<PB N="115" REF="146">
the mo&s;t crowded and fa&s;hionable. Mr. Quin for &s;ome time played his Jaques, Apemantus, Richard, Cato, Sir John Brute, and Fal&s;taff, un|&s;upported; but he &s;oon received a powerful re|inforcement. On Saturday December 21&s;t 1741, Mrs. Cibber made her fir&s;t appearance in this kingdom, in Indiana in the Con&s;cious Lovers, to Mr. Quin's Young Bevil. This extraordinary actre&s;s had been for &s;ome years rapidly ri&s;ing in her profe&s;&s;ion, and had then attained that emi|nence &s;he &s;o de&s;ervedly held till her death. Mrs. Cibber's agreement with the proprietors of Aungier-&s;treet was for three hundred pounds, a &s;um they were well enabled to pay from the money &s;he drew, though to her fir&s;t night there was not ten pounds.</P>
<P>This extraordinary acqui&s;ition could not fail to turn the &s;cale in favour of the theatre which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch capital performers. Mr. Quin's Chamont, and Mrs. Cibber's Monimia were re|peated &s;everal times. They played together Comus and the Lady, the Duke in Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, and I&s;abel. The Spani&s;h Fryar and Queen, Horatio and Cali&s;ta, &amp;c. with uncom|mon applau&s;e, and generally to crowded hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="147">Mr. Duval on his part was not idle. He en|gaged Mr. Wright, an actor of great merit, who made his fir&s;t appearance in Lear. This gentle|man, with Mrs. Furnival, Mr. Wetherilt, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Elrington, Mr. I&s;aac Sparks, compo&s;ed the principal part of the Smock-alley company. Names too feeble to oppo&s;e to tho&s;e of Quin and Cibber. Duval al&s;o invited over Mr. Chetwood, who had been prompter upwards of twenty years at Drury-lane. To his advice and experience the Dublin &s;tage owed many im|provements. By his direction a machini&s;t from one of the London theatres was engaged, who fir&s;t worked the wings by means of a barrel underneath, which moved them together at the &s;ame time with the &s;cenes. This was publicly boa&s;ted of as a ma&s;ter-piece of mechani&s;m; at pre&s;ent it is well under&s;tood and con&s;tantly prac|ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>This winter a new mu&s;ic-hall was built in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet, by the &s;ub&s;cribers to the mu&s;ical &s;ociety then held at the Bull's-Head, and their fir&s;t concert in it was on October the 2d, 1741. Shortly after, the famous Mr. Handel, who&s;e memory mu&s;t be dear to all lovers of mu&s;ic, came over here, and his fir&s;t oratorio was per|formed
<PB N="117" REF="148">
in the new mu&s;ic-hall the December following, in which Mrs. Cibber &s;ung &s;everal of the principal &s;ongs. After the departure of Mr. Quin for London, which was in February 1742, &s;o great was her character, that &s;he con|tinued to draw hou&s;es, e&s;pecially in Polly in the Beggars Opera, which was often repeated, and allowed by the fir&s;t judges to be &s;uperior to any that ever played it.</P>
<P>In February 1741, the tragedy of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, or the Deliverer of his Country, which had become &s;o popular from its rejection by the lord-chamberlain, when it was ready for repre|&s;entation at the theatre-royal Drury-lane, was got up with much care and attention at Aungier-&s;treet, and was performed &s;everal nights with great &s;ucce&s;s. The author, Henry Brooke, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was a native of this kingdom, and gained great reputation as a writer by his Farmers Letters. In 1738 the drama fir&s;t felt the weight of a licen&s;er's power by his re&s;triction of the above tragedy. Mr. Brooke however was not injured by the prohibition, for on publi&s;hing the play by &s;ub&s;cription, he gained upwards of a thou&s;and pounds by it. The operation of the act not extending to Ireland, and it having a
<PB N="118" REF="149">
con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit, it kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>To an emulation between the rival theatres, the public was, in all probability, indebted for the great plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;uch capital per|formers. The extraordinary attraction of Quin and Cibber at Aungier-&s;treet, obliged Duval to u&s;e every effort to &s;tem the torrent. His endea|vours &s;ucceeded equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations, and Smock-alley in turn reigned triumphant. For his latter &s;ea&s;on he engaged Mr. Giffard, Mi&s;s Woffington, and Mr. Garrick. Either of the&s;e latter names would have com|manded the attention of the town without any other aid, but &s;uch combined powers had never heretofore appeared on the Iri&s;h &s;tage.</P>
<P>June 15th 1742, Mi&s;s Woffington opened in her favourite character of Sir Harry Wildair, and charmed her beholders beyond expre&s;&s;ion. On the Friday following, Mr. Garrick appeared in Richard the Third. His name drew crowds, and more were obliged to return than could gain admi&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who were fortunate enough to &s;ucceed, were in raptures at his performance. Great as their expectations were, his execution
<PB N="119" REF="150">
exceeded them. His &s;econd part was Chamont in the Orphan, which he repeated, Monimia by Mrs. Furnival; his third Lear, Cordelia, Mi&s;s Woffington, and Edgar, Mr. Giffard, with his own farce of the Lying Valet, in which he played Sharp. After a few un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts, Aungier-&s;treet clo&s;ed with Mrs. Cib|ber's Andromache, the la&s;t character this admi|rable actre&s;s performed in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, Giffard, and Mi&s;s Woffington continued playing till the 19th of Augu&s;t, during which time they acted Clodio, Carlos and An|gelina in the Fop's Fortune; Richard, Henry and Lady Anne; Pierre and Jaffier, Belvidera, Furnival, with Schoolboy by Garrick; Hamlet Garrick, Ophelia, Woffington; their la&s;t were, Captain Plume and Sylvia, Serjeant Kite by Mr. Walker, the original Macheath, who had ju&s;t come over.</P>
<P>Though great was Garrick's name, and much expected from him, yet his &s;ucce&s;s exceeded all imagination. He was care&s;&s;ed by all ranks of people as a theatrical phenomenon. At the &s;ame time ju&s;tice obliges us to acknowledge, that Mi&s;s Woffington contributed largely
<PB N="120" REF="151">
towards the extraordinary entertainment the pub|lic received, and was nearly as great a favourite. With truth it may be &s;aid they were two of the fir&s;t performers of the age.&mdash;No wonder then, that during the hotte&s;t months of the year, the theatre was each night crowded with per&s;ons of the fir&s;t con&s;equence. However, the exce&s;&s;ive heats proved fatal to many, and an epidemic di&s;temper &s;eized and carried off numbers, and which from the circum&s;tance was called the <HI>Garrick Fever.</HI></P>
<P>Highly &s;atisfied with the profit and reputation ari&s;ing from this excur&s;ion, and delighted with the generous and ho&s;pitable reception they ex|perienced from the nobility and gentry of this kingdom, and which they always acknowledged in the warme&s;t terms, Mr. Garrick and Mi&s;s Woffington returned to London, to reap new honours in the field of theatrical glory.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE is a point which human perfection can attain, beyond which it is impo&s;&s;ible to go. The managers of both theatres &s;eemed to have reached this ultimatum. They had now fea&s;ted the public with the performance of the be&s;t actors, Quin and Cibber, Garrick and Woffington. Their re&s;ources thus exhau&s;ted, nece&s;&s;ity obliged them eagerly to &s;eize on the fir&s;t novelty which pre&s;ented it&s;elf. Un&s;atisfied with the &s;ituation of affairs at Aungier-&s;treet, Mr. Swan came forward as acting manager and occa|&s;ional actor. He laudably, at the beginning of
<PB N="122" REF="153">
the &s;ea&s;on, opened a &s;ub&s;cription for eight of Shake&s;peare's principal plays, which however did very little. But Duval, unmindful of the reputation he had &s;o lately acquired, by a &s;ingle &s;troke deba&s;ed the Iri&s;h &s;tage to a degree never known before. This was by engaging a com|pany of tumblers and rope-dancers, who, though the fir&s;t in Europe, &s;hould not have been &s;uf|fered to di&s;grace the walls of the lowe&s;t &s;tage in it. Such diver&s;ions are very well in their proper place, but &s;hould never be admitted to contaminate the in&s;ide of a theatre. However, they drew the admiring multitude, and &s;o far an&s;wered the end of the manager.</P>
<P>Le&s;t I &s;hould be thought not to do ju&s;tice to the merits of the&s;e extraordinary gentry, I &s;hall here pre&s;ent the reader with one of their curious adverti&s;ements.</P>
<P>By permi&s;&s;ion of the Rt. Hon. <HI>Luke Gardiner,</HI> E&s;q. At the Theatre SMOCK-ALLEY,</P>
<P>This pre&s;ent evening, Tue&s;day December 7th, 1742, will be pre&s;ented by the celebrated com|pany of Germans, Dutch, Italians and French, &s;everal feats of activity, con&s;i&s;ting of Rope-dancing, Tumbling, Vaulting, Equilibres, and
<PB N="123" REF="154">
Ground Dancing. Madam Garman performs on the Rope with Stilts, (never done here) and will al&s;o perform on the Slack Rope. Mon&s;ieur Dominique will perform the &s;urpri&s;ing equilibres of the Circle, never attempted by any but him&s;elf, in which he is drawn up forty feet high on his head, fires off two pi&s;tols, and is let down again in the &s;ame po&s;ture. Mon&s;ieur Dominique and Mon&s;ieur Guittar perform the &s;urpri&s;ing tumble over the double Fountain. Mon&s;ieur Dominique tumbles through an Hog&s;head of Fire in the Middle, and a lighted Torch in each Hand, &amp;c.</P>
<P>O &s;hame, where is thy blu&s;h! The very boards which but a few months before were trod by the fir&s;t actors of the age, now "&s;ated with cele&s;tial food, and feeding upon garbage." To the credit however of public ta&s;te, none but the very lowe&s;t of the people went to &s;ee them. The galleries were crouded, but 'twas a reproach to be &s;een in the boxes. Every per&s;on of &s;en&s;e lamented the di&s;grace and decline of the &s;tage, now perverted from its noble&s;t u&s;es. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;urely the interference of the legi&s;lature is not only highly laudable, but e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. Mr. Swan,
<PB N="124" REF="155">
with a &s;pirit which did him credit, endeavoured to expo&s;e the baleful encroachment to the utmo&s;t of his power. On this occa&s;ion he delivered the following prologue with great propriety, which was loudly and judiciou&s;ly applauded.</P>

<P><PB N="126" REF="157">The&s;e well-meant efforts of the Aungier-&s;treet company were, however, ineffectual. The per|formers had not merit &s;ufficient to attract the notice of the public. The &s;tage indeed had long been in a declining condition. To effect this a variety of cau&s;es concurred. The city was not then populous enough to &s;upport two theatres. If one had a tolerable run of &s;ucce&s;s, ruin was the con&s;equence to the other. Salaries were badly paid, bu&s;ine&s;s was totally neglected, whil&s;t irregularity and indecorum pervaded the whole.</P>
<P>Though one party had de&s;cended &s;o low as to call in the aid of tumbling and rope-dancing to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the other, di&s;daining &s;uch un|worthy re&s;ources, had recour&s;e to the nobler and more rational powers of mu&s;ic to &s;uccour poor neglected Shake&s;peare. The celebrated Dr. Arne, &s;o eminent for his mu&s;ical abilities, had lately vi&s;ited the kingdom, and was at that time performing at the new Mu&s;ic-hall in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet, where he had under his direc|tion a company of the be&s;t &s;ingers ever heard in Dublin.</P>
<P>The&s;e the proprietors engaged, and in order to exhibit them to the highe&s;t advantage, revived
<PB N="127" REF="158">
the Ma&s;que of Comus, with every expence and attention nece&s;&s;ary to render it worthy of public notice. Dr. Arne conducted the mu&s;ical depart|ment; he new &s;et the whole piece, divided the choru&s;&s;es into parts, which till then had been &s;ung in uni&s;on, and was warmly intere&s;ted in its &s;ucce&s;s. Meantime the manager prepared new &s;cenery, dre&s;&s;es, and decorations. The parts were ca&s;t as follows:&mdash;Comus, Mr. Swan; fir&s;t Spirit, Mr. Sparks; &s;econd Spirit, Mr. Wat&s;on; Elder Brother, Mr. Bardin; Younger Brother, Mr. J. Elrington; the Lady, Mrs. Elmy; the &s;ong of "Sweet Echo," accompanied on the German Flute by Mr. Neale; Pa&s;toral Nymph and Sabrina, by Mrs. Arne; Euphro&s;yne, Mrs. Bailden; Principal Bacchanal, by Madam Sybille, both pupils of Dr. Arne; a double orche&s;tre, led by Dr. Arne. The prologue was &s;poken by Mr. Swan, the epilogue by Mrs. Furnival.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e preparations it was brought out on the 10th of January, 1742-3, to a crouded hou&s;e, when it was received with the highe&s;t marks of applau&s;e, and amply repaid the mana|ger's pains and expence, by being often repeated with &s;ucce&s;s. This induced the manager to get
<PB N="128" REF="159">
up &s;everal other mu&s;ical pieces, which were per|formed with much credit and profit.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten from &s;o unintere&s;ting a &s;ubject. Too long have I been obliged to pre|&s;ent my readers with a di&s;agreeable portrait of the Iri&s;h &s;tage. 'Tis time to draw a veil over the di&s;graceful and humiliating &s;tate in which the drama had langui&s;hed &s;ince the days of A&s;hbury and Elrington. Temporary gleams of &s;un&s;hine had occa&s;ionally intervened, but they &s;oon vani&s;hed, and only &s;erved by contra&s;t to augment the gloom which &s;ucceeded. A brighter period now approaches in which the &s;tage re|gained, nay even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed its former lu&s;tre, and &s;hone forth with a &s;plendor worthy the Greek and Roman days.</P>
<P>From the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tances ofttimes the greate&s;t and mo&s;t unlooked-for events &s;pring; thus, the appearance and &s;ucce&s;s of a new actor produced &s;ome time after the mo&s;t remarkable change ever known in the theatrical affairs of Ireland.</P>

This attempt &s;ucceeded beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the friends of our young candidate for fame, and equalled any fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay ever remembered by the olde&s;t performers on the Iri&s;h &s;tage. Thus encouraged, our adventurer a few days after undertook the character of Mithridates, in the tragedy of that name, written by Lee, in which he &s;o amply confirmed public opinion, that he threw off the di&s;gui&s;e, and was &s;hortly after an|nounced to the town for a &s;econd performance of Richard by the name of Mr. Sheridan.</P>
<P>This gentleman was the &s;on of the Rev. Dr. Sheridan, a character well known in the literary world, e&s;teemed a man of great abilities, and often celebrated by Dr. Swift, with whom he lived in the mo&s;t intimate habits of friend&s;hip. Mr. Sheridan was born in the year 1719, and early di&s;covering &s;igns of genius, was at a proper age &s;ent to We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool, where he re|mained till he was prepared to enter the univer|&s;ity of Dublin. After going through his &s;tudies with great eclat, and taking his degrees, he quitted college, contrary to the wi&s;hes of his friends, who &s;trongly urged him to undertake the arduous ta&s;k of reading for a fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="161">Perhaps it would have been better for him|&s;elf in the end, if he had taken their advice. With &s;uch abilities, his path to ea&s;e and inde|pendence had then been ea&s;y, and &s;ucce&s;s, in all probability, would &s;oon have crowned his endea|vours. In&s;tead of that, the profe&s;&s;ion he em|braced, involved the greate&s;t part of his life in a perpetual round of anxious toil, and uncea&s;ing fatigue, wherein he experienced every &s;pecies of ingratitude and perfidy.</P>
<P>Fortunately however for the intere&s;ts of the drama, the bent of his genius led him to the pur&s;uit of fame in her alluring images. He long had cheri&s;hed an extraordinary predilection for the &s;tage, and though at that time it pre|&s;ented pro&s;pects far from inviting, yet nothing could di&s;&s;uade him from indulging his darling pa&s;&s;ion. The extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s he met with amply ju&s;tified his determination. Like Garrick, he at fir&s;t &s;hone forth a fini&s;hed actor, and at once attained the heights which many others &s;pend years in labouring to gain.</P>
<P>He repeated Richard for his own benefit, February 19th, to a numerous audience, and &s;hortly after in Hamlet gave fre&s;h proofs of his
<PB N="131" REF="162">
uncommon talents. The remainder of the &s;ea&s;on he &s;tudied and played Brutus in Julius Cae&s;ar, Carlos in the Fop's Fortune, Othello, Lord Townly, and Cato; his performance of the latter added much to his reputation.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer birds of pa&s;&s;age this year were Mr. Theophilus Cibber with Mr. and Mrs. Giffard at Smock-alley, and Mr. Havard at Aungier-&s;treet. The former brought money, but the latter was of no great &s;ervice; however, altogether they were &s;ome relief to the public, who began to be heartily tired with li&s;tening to di&s;putes which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between ma|nagers and performers, and con&s;tantly witne&s;&s;ing &s;cenes of di&s;order and irregularity at both theatres.</P>
<P>Mr. Theophilus Cibber made his fir&s;t appear|ance in Lord Foppington in his father's comedy of the Carele&s;s Hu&s;band. Mr. and Mrs. Gif|fard were the Sir Charles Ea&s;y, and Lady Betty Modi&s;h. The pieces revived on this occa&s;ion were the Relap&s;e, Lord Foppington, Cibber; Lovelace and Berinthia, by the Giffards; with Cibber's Mock Doctor. The Old Batchelor, in which they played Fondlewife, Belmour and Letitia, with the Schoolboy by Cibber. The
<PB N="132" REF="163">
Con&s;cious Lovers, Tom, Bevil, and Indiana, with the Rehear&s;al, in which Cibber played Bays.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with a reputation ju&s;tly acquired in comedy, we find Mr. Cibber exhibiting his beautiful per&s;on, and charming with his har|monious tones in tragedy. Accordingly, much to his own &s;atisfaction, he played Polydore in the Orphan, Syphax in Cato, and Lothario in the Fair Penitent; in the latter Mr. Giffard performed Altamont, Mr. Sheridan, Horatio, and Mrs. Giffard, Cali&s;ta: perhaps the public will not readily believe that Cibber's vanity could tempt him &s;o far as to play Othello; &s;uch however really was the ca&s;e; Wright, an actor of merit, acted Iago. Mr. and Mrs. Giffard, Ca&s;&s;io and De&s;demona. At the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, the Giffards with Mr. Cibber and Mr. Havard returned to England. Of Mr. Sheridan I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak largely.</P>
<P>Envy is the &s;ure attendant on merit, and with a jaundiced eye converts into blemi&s;hes its greate&s;t beauties. The high reputation, and rapid ri&s;e of Mr. Sheridan, even thus early, procured him many enemies. Parties were
<PB N="133" REF="164">
formed again&s;t him, and every endeavour made u&s;e of to impede his &s;ucce&s;s. However, his fame was too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to &s;uffer by &s;uch unfair methods, they only &s;erved to render him more popular. The following letters written by a large party of young gentlemen in the college, who were di&s;appointed in &s;eeing him perform Cato, will confirm this fact.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The proprietors of both theatres unite.&mdash;A new oppo&s;ition formed in Smock-alley.&mdash;Mr. Sheridan joins them.&mdash;Goes to London.&mdash;Mr. Barry's fir&s;t appearance in Othello.&mdash;His character.&mdash; Mr. Foote plays at Aungier-&s;treet.&mdash;New theatre in Capel-&s;treet opens with the Merchant of Venice.&mdash;Mr. Sheridan recalled and appointed &s;ole manager.&mdash;Engages Mr. Lacy, Mi&s;s Bel|lamy, and Mr. Garrick.&mdash;Li&s;t of his performers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE interval which &s;ucceeded produced what had been long wi&s;hed for by every un|prejudiced and di&s;intere&s;ted lover of the drama, a coalition of parties between the contending theatres. Convinced by &s;ad experience, that each had been for many years playing a lo&s;ing game, and wearied out with vexatious unprofit|able di&s;putes, the proprietors of both concluded it would be for their mutual advantage to unite intere&s;ts, and perform in Aungier-&s;treet theatre only. This &s;alutary expedient however, did not</P>
<PB N="137" REF="168">
<P>an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed. In forming a new company out of the two old ones, it became nece&s;&s;ary to reject many: the&s;e thinking them|&s;elves aggrieved, had the addre&s;s, by fraudulent means, I believe, to obtain the old lea&s;e of Smock-alley theatre from Duval the principal proprietor, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, determined, de&s;perate as their &s;ituation was, to form an oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As their numbers were too few to play any piece, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of engaging a little company then acting in the North, who elated with the hopes of reaping fame and profit in the metropolis, ha&s;tily repaired bag and bag|gage to Dublin. From &s;uch reinforcements little could be expected. Luckily however for them, Mr. Sheridan had not acceded to the terms offered him by the Aungier-&s;treet ma|nagers, which were, an hundred pounds for playing till the benefits commenced, and an hundred pounds en&s;ured by his own benefit. The&s;e he rejected, and with &s;ome degree of rea&s;on, he &s;aid that it was 50l. le&s;s than Mrs. Furnival's &s;alary, that it was le&s;s than Made|moi&s;elle Chateneuf's, and about a third of what they gave Mr. Arne and Mr. Lowe.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="169">The Mr. Lowe alluded to by Mr. Sheridan was the celebrated &s;inger of that name, then in his meridian, who made his fir&s;t appearance in Ireland in the part of Macheath in the Beggars Opera, which was played eight nights. Peachum by Mr. Sparks, Lockit by Mr. Beam&s;ly, Filch by Mr. Dyer, Lucy by Mrs. Bayley, Mrs. Peachum Mi&s;s Polly Davis, and Polly by Made-moi&s;elle Chateneuf.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan &s;aw with concern the fallen &s;ituation of the &s;tage, and thus early formed a de&s;ign of removing its di&s;orders and reforming its abu&s;es. To accompli&s;h this romantic project his ambition led him to a&s;pire to the government of the whole. He in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ole ma|nagement of the theatre, and in return he offered the proprietors to &s;ecure them five hundred pounds per year. This they refu&s;ing with di&s;|dain, he immediately went over to the other party, who opened a few days after with the tragedy of Richard, thus advertized.&mdash;"The part of King Richard the Third by Mr. Sheridan, King Henry by Mr. Elrington, and all the re&s;t of the parts by per&s;ons who never appeared on this &s;tage." Among&s;t the&s;e new performers were Mrs. Storer who played Lady Anne, and

<P>A paper war now en&s;ued between the rival theatres, in which each as u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, laid the whole blame on the other. A &s;hort time however determined the di&s;pute. The party Mr. Sheridan e&s;pou&s;ed were &s;o de&s;titute of merit, that his utmo&s;t abilities were in&s;uf|ficient to &s;upport them; &s;o after a &s;truggle of a few weeks, he accepted of a capital engagement from the manager of Drury-lane theatre, and left Dublin in January 1744.</P>
<P>On his withdrawing him&s;elf, oppo&s;ition cea&s;ed, a few of the principal actors of Smock-alley were taken into favour, and the united com|panies played occa&s;ionally at each theatre. Every thing went on in the u&s;ual train. Bad manage|ment with the con&s;tant attendants, irregularity and poverty, &s;till prevailed.</P>
<P>At this unfavourable juncture did Mr. Barry make his fir&s;t debut, on that &s;tage which for many years afterwards he &s;o powerfully &s;up|ported. And here I cannot help ob&s;erving, that whil&s;t the pens of the fir&s;t writers of the age
<PB N="140" REF="171">
have been employed in recording <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and &s;ounding the prai&s;es of Garrick, the abilities of his cotemporary competitors in the dramatic field of glory, Sheridan and Barry, were only occa&s;ionally mentioned, and &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>Very imperfect indeed has been the infor|mation we have relative to Mr. Barry. The little that can be depended on, I &s;hall commu|nicate to my readers. Spranger Barry, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was born in Skinner-row, Dublin, in the year 1717. He was de&s;cended from a very good family, and nearly related to Barry, the la&s;t lord Santry. He received a tolerable education, and &s;ucceeded his father an eminent &s;ilver-&s;mith in bu&s;ine&s;s: in this &s;ituation he married and re|mained &s;everal years in the &s;ame &s;treet he was born in. At what time he di&s;covered a pro|pen&s;ity for the &s;tage, we cannot learn, when he commenced actor he was about 27 years of age.</P>
<P>In one of her happie&s;t moments did nature produce this excellent actor, and with an un|&s;paring hand &s;he bountifully heaped her choice&s;t favours on him. It was impo&s;&s;ible for imagina|tion to conceive a more perfect or fini&s;hed figure than he at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. To this
<PB N="141" REF="172">
figure was added a voice, the harmony and melody of who&s;e &s;ilver tones were re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, and ever will be remembered whil&s;t memory holds her &s;eat, by tho&s;e who had the happine&s;s of hearing that great actor in the zenith of his theatrical glory. His carriage and action, though far from fini&s;hed, were by no means ungraceful, and in both of the&s;e, time made a wonderful improvement.</P>
<P>The character of Othello was judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en for Mr. Barry's fir&s;t appearance. It is one of Shake&s;peare's ma&s;ter-pieces, and in my opinion one of the fine&s;t portraits ever drawn, and requires greater abilities in an actor to &s;u&s;tain. His per&s;on was happily adapted to re|pre&s;ent the noble Moor, and his powers to de|lineate the various affecting tran&s;itions of love, jealou&s;y, rage, and tenderne&s;s, which peculiarly mark the character.</P>
<P>As at this di&s;tance of time every information relative to the fir&s;t appearance of &s;o great an ornament to the drama, mu&s;t naturally excite attention, the following bill of that night's en|tertainment, will I hope, prove an acceptable curio&s;ity.</P>

Pierre was his next part, in which he met with equal &s;ucce&s;s, though &s;ome years afterwards he found Jaffier more &s;uited to di&s;play the tender|ne&s;s of his feelings.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is not in dramatic hi&s;tory any thing more &s;ingular or worthy remarking than the following. That three of the greate&s;t per|formers of the age, Garrick, Barry, and She|ridan, were born within three years of each other, and appeared on the &s;tage within the &s;ame compa&s;s of years.

theatres finding their affairs beyond their power to retrieve, and the &s;tage reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb, as their dernier re&s;ort, and at the reque&s;t of the public, &s;olicited Mr. Sheridan to return, and take on him&s;elf the &s;ole direction and management of the &s;tage, offering to ve&s;t him with unlimited authority to act in every re&s;pect as he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>This was the only atonement in their power for a long &s;eries of ill conduct and imprudence, but this indeed compen&s;ated for all their former errors.</P>

<P>This was a delicate point to compa&s;s, for we may recollect, that Mr. Sheridan was now &s;ole manager of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, the darling of the public, and could with the greate&s;t propriety play every character he cho&s;e. Thus &s;ituated, and &s;econded by &s;o eminent an actor as Mr. Barry, who&s;e abilities did not in the lea&s;t interfere with his, it might naturally be expected he would behold with a jealous eye, any per&s;on who&s;e ex|traordinary merit might &s;hake or le&s;&s;en his new acquired power. Yet thus circum&s;tanced, with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and public &s;pirit &s;eldom &s;hewn, Mr. Sheridan u&s;ed every effort to engage the
<PB N="151" REF="182">
only man on the &s;tage who&s;e uncommon talents he had rea&s;on to entertain a jealou&s;y of.</P>
<P>He accordingly wrote a letter to Mr. Garrick to this purpo&s;e: "that under&s;tanding he had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to pay a &s;econd vi&s;it to Ireland, he informed him, that as he was then &s;ole manager of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, he &s;hould be happy to &s;ee him in Dublin, and that he would give him every advantage and encouragement he could in rea&s;on expect." In &s;hort, he made an offer to divide the profits ari&s;ing from their united repre&s;entations with him, after deducting the expences incurred. And as there had been a &s;ort of rival&s;hip and coolne&s;s between them before Mr. Sheridan left London, he at the &s;ame time frankly told him, that he mu&s;t expect nothing from his friend&s;hip, but all that the be&s;t actor had a right to command, he might be very certain &s;hould be granted.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick was at colonel Wyndham's when he received this letter. After looking it over, he put it into the colonel's hand, &s;aying, "this is the odde&s;t epi&s;tle I ever read in my life." "It may be an odd one," replied the colonel, after he had peru&s;ed it, "but it is &s;urely an hone&s;t
<PB N="152" REF="183" MS="y">
one. I &s;hould certainly depend upon a man that treated me with that openne&s;s and &s;implicity of heart." Mr. Garrick accordingly accepted the invitation, and repaired to Ireland.</P>
<P>On his landing in Dublin, he was met by Mr. Sheridan, who offered to fulfil his promi&s;e, of &s;haring profits and lo&s;&s;es. Though nothing could be fairer than this propo&s;al, yet Mr. Gar|rick in&s;i&s;ted on a &s;tipulated &s;um for performing during the winter. The other objected to the demand, and per&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t offer, which, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, was the mo&s;t rea&s;onable; for then Mr. Garrick would receive as much money as he brought, and others would not be lo&s;ers. In the other ca&s;e he perhaps might be the only gainer. After &s;ome little di&s;pute, which Mr. Sheridan decided, by taking out his watch, and in&s;i&s;ting upon an an&s;wer in five minutes, Mr. Garrick &s;ubmitted, and the affair terminated in the mo&s;t amicable manner.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, Mr. Sheridan took the field early the next &s;ea&s;on with &s;uch a company as Dublin had till then never beheld, and which her theatrical annals cannot parallel. The com|bined powers of Mr. Garrick, Mr. Lacy, Mr.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Sheridan undertakes to reform the &s;tage.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS important bu&s;ine&s;s being &s;ettled, the ma|nager entered upon the arduous, and then e&s;teem|ed chimerical plan, of reforming and re&s;toring the &s;tage to its native purity. Great was his ta&s;k, and Herculean were his labours. Happily, nature had amply endowed him with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites for &s;o difficult and dangerous an undertaking. His temper was remarkably mild and gentle, yet was he unremittingly per|&s;evering in accompli&s;hing whatever he embarked in. Though he always endeavoured to convince, and demon&s;trate the propriety of his orders, rather than command, yet was he re&s;olute in en|forcing compliance to whatever he was a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="155" REF="186">
was right. His under&s;tanding was clear and comprehen&s;ive, and a liberal education enabled him to behold objects in their proper light.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the &s;tage, he had long beheld with regret, the humiliating condition to which it was reduced: de&s;pi&s;ed and de&s;erted by the grave, the rational, and every lover of order and decency. He &s;aw the magnitude of the bu&s;ine&s;s he was engaged in, yet he de&s;paired not. Intimately acquainted with the &s;tate of the Greek and Roman drama, when arrived at their highe&s;t point of perfection, he nobly laboured with uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity, towards the attainment of a grand object, that of RAISING THE IRISH THEATRE TO AN EQUAL DEGREE OF RESPECTABILITY.</P>
<P>Informed on every &s;ubject, and attentive to the minute&s;t circum&s;tance, no part e&s;caped his penetrating eye. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tage was reduced to a regular &s;cience, in which the mo&s;t trifling parts of the great machine, equally con|tributed towards the movement and beauty of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="187">We mu&s;t not however imagine that all this was accompli&s;hed in a day. It was the work of years. Perfection is only to be attained by per&s;everance, and it is worthy to be remarked, that the la&s;t day of his management was in every re&s;pect, as laudable and as prai&s;eworthy as his fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Non-payment of &s;alaries he knew was the radical &s;ource of di&s;orders. Who would attend rehear&s;als, or take pains in their profe&s;&s;ion, when they were uncertain of any recompen&s;e, and perhaps, had not even the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence? Poverty begot carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indif|ference, and in the end drove many to di&s;grace|ful actions, which nothing but nece&s;&s;ity could excu&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely credible, though &s;trictly true, that before Mr. Sheridan's time, the great I&s;aac Sparks had but twelve &s;hillings per week, Mr. Dyer, eight &s;hillings, Mr. Elrington, a guinea, and the re&s;t in proportion. Mi&s;erable as the&s;e pittances were, they many weeks re|ceived not above the half of their re&s;pective demands. Perhaps the following, though from unque&s;tionable authority, will at this time be</P>
<PB N="157" REF="188">
<P>hardly believed. So reduced were their finances, and exhau&s;ted their credit, that the acting mana|gers, as they were called, were once obliged to repair to the theatre on the evening of a play, dinnerle&s;s. The fir&s;t &s;hilling that came into the hou&s;e they di&s;patched for a loin of mutton, the &s;econd for bread, the third for liquor, and &s;o on till they had &s;atisfied the calls of nature, when they prepared for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the night.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan's fir&s;t care therefore was to rai&s;e mo&s;t of the actor's &s;alaries, and for this purpo&s;e, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund for the regular di&s;charge of &s;alaries and trade&s;mens bills. This rule he never deviated from, and amid&s;t all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, on the wreck of his fortune in 1754, he could, with an hone&s;t pride, publicly boa&s;t in a pamphlet he then publi&s;hed, that <HI>"Every Saturday &s;aw the weekly &s;alary of each per&s;on di&s;charged at the trea&s;urer's office,</HI> and that the books of that office will &s;hew, that at the clo&s;e of the account la&s;t Saturday, <HI>there was not a demand upon him of any performer what&s;oever, from his fir&s;t undertaking the management twelve years ago, to that hour, left unpaid."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="189">It may be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that he had at fir&s;t many difficulties to encounter. The &s;tage had long been under the direction of &s;even ma|nagers, who in deri&s;ion were called by the town, the &s;even wi&s;e ma&s;ters. Bad habits, confirmed by time, were hard to be eradicated. Perform|ers were unu&s;ed to regularity, and the ta&s;te of the town was palled and violated. Neverthele&s;s when the work of reformation was a little ad|vanced, the ta&s;k grew much ea&s;ier. His me|thods were &s;o gentle, and at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;a|lutary, that they carried conviction with them.</P>
<P>The good &s;en&s;e of the actors pointed out to them the propriety of the manager's conduct, and the nece&s;&s;ity there was of conforming to his directions. He con&s;tantly attended the rehear|&s;als, and &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s of each &s;cene with preci&s;ion. Not the mo&s;t trifling incident of the night's performance was omitted at the la&s;t morning's practice; and, though the &s;tricte&s;t at|tendance was required, yet were the rehear&s;als &s;o rea&s;onably appointed, that it was in every per|&s;on's power to comply, and &s;eldom was he under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of being obliged to en|force obedience by forfeits: he rightly judged that money gained by tho&s;e means was the &s;eve|re&s;t
<PB N="159" REF="190">
of lo&s;&s;es, and rather than be forced to recur to them, when admonition failed, he cho&s;e &s;ooner to part with the performer, however valuable, who continued to offend in this manner.</P>
<P>At rehear&s;als, his great jugdment and know|ledge of the &s;tage, amply qualified him for an in&s;tructor; and his regulations were &s;o proper, and conveyed in &s;o plea&s;ing a manner that they were irre&s;i&s;tible, and could not fail of being com|plied with. His highe&s;t ambition &s;eemed to center in being con&s;idered as the father of his company.</P>
<P>The minutiae of the &s;tage were al&s;o diligently attended to. His decorations were truly elegant, and his plays were dre&s;&s;ed with characteri&s;tic propriety. Indeed, he has frequently been blamed for launching into expences which the profits of the performances were unable to repay. Upon the whole, we may with confidence a&s;&s;ert, that, during Mr. Sheridan's management, plays were conducted in a &s;tyle equal in mo&s;t re&s;pects to any the Briti&s;h &s;tage ever produced. How meritorious then was the man who rai&s;ed the Iri&s;h theatre to &s;uch an eminence!</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="191">The importance of the &s;ubject will, I hope plead my excu&s;e for &s;o long a digre&s;&s;ion. To return. The campaign opened early in October 1744. After playing a few weeks he brought out Mi&s;s Bellamy, November 11th, at Aun|gier-&s;treet, in Monimia; Ca&s;talio by Mr. Barry; Polydore by Mr. Lacy; Chamont, him&s;elf. Mi&s;s Bellamy, as a young promi&s;ing actre&s;s, plea&s;ed much. Her &s;econd part was De&s;demona, to Mr. Sheridan's Othello.</P>
<P>Like a &s;kilful general, Mr. Sheridan re&s;erved his greate&s;t &s;trength for a corps de re&s;erve. Mr. Garrick did not come forward till the novelty of the other performers was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, abated. His fir&s;t appearance was at Smock-alley theatre, Monday December 9th, in the character of Hamlet; Queen, Mrs. Furnival; Ophelia, Mrs. Storer. His reception was &s;uch as his un|common merit and extraordinary character de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior manner in which plays in gene|ral, but particularly tragedies, were then &s;up|ported, mu&s;t appear from the names of Garrick, Sheridan, Barry, Bellamy and Furnival, in one piece; what a fea&s;t for the dramatic amateur!
<PB N="161" REF="192">
In order to give the abilities of Mr. Garrick every fair play, Mr. Sheridan generou&s;ly con|&s;ented to their playing capital characters alter|nately, as Richard, Hamlet, &amp;c. and to give a peculiar &s;trength they agreed each to play Iago to Mr. Barry's Othello. Among&s;t the tragedies remarkably &s;trong were, the Fair Penitent, Lo|thario, Mr. Garrick; Horatio, Mr. Sheridan; Altamont, Mr. Barry, who we are told played it &s;o very finely as to make it appear equally re&s;pec|table with the two former characters. Sciolto, Mr. Beam&s;ly; Cali&s;ta, Mrs. Furnival, and Lavi|nia, Mi&s;s Bellamy. And the Orphan, Mr. Garrick, Chamont; Barry, Ca&s;talio; Beam&s;ly, Arca&s;to; Sheridan, Polydore; and Bellamy, Monimia.</P>
<P>The characters which Mr. Garrick played that winter in Dublin, were in the following order: Hamlet, Richard, Bayes, Archer, Lothario, Mac|beth, Lear, Ba&s;tard in King John, Sir John Brute, School Boy, Chamont, Ore&s;tes, Othello, Iago, Ha&s;tings, and Sharp in his own farce of the Lying Valet. The two la&s;t were for his own benefit, and the la&s;t time of his ever performing in this kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="193">Never did the drama experience &s;o &s;udden a tran&s;ition as from the la&s;t to the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on. The winter before all was di&s;grace, poverty, and empty benches, whil&s;t ruin and de&s;olation reigned triumphant. Now order came &s;miling forward, and in her train followed peace, plenty, honour and public e&s;teem. The nobleman and man of fa&s;hion; the &s;ons of &s;cience; the grave citizen, and the mode&s;t fair, long bani&s;hed from the theatre, now with plea&s;ure enjoy|ed once more their favourite rational amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>The witty earl of Che&s;terfield was then lord lieutenant of Ireland. His attachment to the &s;tage had been long known. Delighted to &s;ee &s;uch excellence, he commanded plays very frequently. His popularity alone would have en&s;ured a bril|liant and crowded attendance. Mr. Davies, in his life of Garrick ob&s;erves, that, "Though he was very gracious to Mr. Sheridan, and admitted his vi&s;its at the ca&s;tle, he took not the lea&s;t notice of Mr. Garrick; nay, when they both waited on him with candles on the night of Mr. Garrick's benefit, he &s;poke very kindly to Mr. Sheridan, but did not even return the &s;alute of the other," He adds, "It &s;eems his lord&s;hip,
<PB N="163" REF="194">
when in Ireland, had a mind to convince the people of that kingdom, that his heart was en|tirely Iri&s;h."</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, lord Che&s;terfield often practi&s;ed the duplicity he &s;o &s;trongly recom|mended to his &s;on. An in&s;tance occurs in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: When in Dublin he profe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t e&s;teem for Mr. Sheridan, and gave every encouragement to his plan of forming an acade|my to teach oratory; and, on his departure, he made u&s;e of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ive words: "Never let the thoughts of your oratorical in&s;titution go out of your mind." Yet, a few years after|wards, when Mr. Sheridan waited upon him in London to fulfil his promi&s;e, that celebrated pa|tron of men of genius, the witty, the generous, the liberal-minded earl of Che&s;terfield, bounti|fully pre&s;ented him with <HI>a guinea,</HI> as his contri|bution towards one of the noble&s;t plans devi&s;ed by human wi&s;dom!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here beg leave to &s;et Mr. Davies right in one particular. In his life of Mr. Garrick, he &s;ays, "During the management of the Dub|lin &s;tage by Garrick and Sheridan, a genius &s;tarted up who&s;e eminence," &amp;c. meaning Mr.
<PB N="164" REF="195">
Barry. In the fir&s;t place Mr. Garrick had no &s;hare in the management, though he had in the profits; the former was Mr. Sheridan's &s;ole province. As to Mr. Barry I have &s;tat|ed before, that he fir&s;t played in February, 1744.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Garrick was &s;o plea&s;ed with his growing merit, that he generou&s;ly bore te&s;timo|ny to it in &s;everal letters written to his friends in London, during his re&s;idence here, a&s;&s;uring them, he was the be&s;t lover he had ever &s;een on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>To Mr. Sheridan's honour, be it ob&s;erved, that through the whole of the connection be|tween him and Mr. Garrick that &s;ea&s;on, &s;uch was his &s;trict adherence to his engagements and open unre&s;erved behaviour, that they parted good friends, Mr. Garrick acknowledging he was the man of honour and the gentleman.</P>
<P>In the beginning of May 1746, he fini&s;hed his theatrical campaign, and, in company with Mr. Victor, afterwards trea&s;urer and manager returned to London, highly plea&s;ed with a
<PB N="165" REF="196">
trip which infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his expectations, both in &s;ame and profit.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after his departure, Mr. Sheridan clo&s;ed his fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, the mo&s;t ho|nourable and brilliant that had then ever mark|ed the Iri&s;h dramatic annals.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>PREVIOUS to the commencement of the next &s;ea&s;on, we find the above-mentioned Mr. Victor, who liking his reception had re|turned, made deputy-manager and trea&s;urer to Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Victor was a gentleman of abilities, and &s;eemed well qualified for &s;uch an office. Mr. Lacy, on his return to London en|gaged Mr. Barry, who&s;e talents he entertained a high opinion of, at a very con&s;iderable &s;alary, for Drury-lane, where he plea&s;ed much and drew crowded hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of two &s;uch capital performers as Garrick and Barry, was a &s;evere blow on Mr.
<PB N="167" REF="198">
Sheridan's ri&s;ing pro&s;pects. However he began with alacrity, and opened a &s;ub&s;cription for &s;ix of Shake&s;peare's plays. The comedy of Much Ado About Nothing was revived, and truly an&s;wered its name, for it brought nothing. That failing, Romeo and juliet was got up with a characteri&s;tic pomp and &s;plendor never before exhibited on the &s;tage in Ireland.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Mr. Sheridan never had much of the lover in his compo&s;ition, and was totally unfit to repre&s;ent the tender &s;ighing Romeo, yet with Mi&s;s Bellamy's Juliet, now a very great favourite, and the picture&s;que manner in which he di&s;played the funeral proce&s;&s;ion, the curio&s;ity of the town was &s;o much attracted as to occa&s;ion it to be performed nine nights to full hou&s;es, an extraordinary circum&s;tance at that time.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Sheridan's efforts &s;ince he com|menced manager were crowned with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, yet oppo&s;ition had not entirely cea&s;ed: the little theatre in Capel-&s;treet opened January 8th 1746-7, with the Provoked Hu&s;band, in which Mi&s;s Ma&s;on, the pre&s;ent Mrs. Heaphy, performed Mi&s;s Jenny. She was then very
<PB N="168" REF="199">
young, and had ju&s;t appeared on the &s;tage, where &s;he played the girls with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. It is with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure I embrace every occa&s;ion through the cour&s;e of this work, of paying a ju&s;t tribute to tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e abilities and character have added lu&s;tre to a profe&s;&s;ion where example ought to enforce pre|cept, and I am happy to point out the pre&s;ent in&s;tance where both, after a &s;eries of years &s;pent in the &s;ervice of the public, are rewarded with a genteel competency, and crowned by the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of the fir&s;t characters in Ireland.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March Mr. Giffard jun. made his fir&s;t appearance in this kingdom, at Capel-&s;treet theatre, in Sir Harry Wildair in the Con|&s;tant Couple; Colonel Standard, Mr. Wright, Vizard, Mr. O'Brien, Beau Clincher, Mr. Layfield, Young Clincher, Mr. Ma&s;on, Alder|man Smuggler, Mr. Mynitt, Jubilee Dicky, Mr. Dale, Lady Lurewell, Mrs. Dale, Angelica, Mi&s;s Ma&s;on, Lady Darling, Mrs. Ma&s;on, Parley, Mrs. Layfield; with the Devil to Pay, Job&s;on, Mr. Layfield, and Nell, Mrs. Layfield.</P>
<P>But to return to Mr. Sheridan. Notwith|&s;tanding the emoluments ari&s;ing from the repre|&s;entation
<PB N="169" REF="200">
of Romeo, the profits of the &s;ea&s;on were likely to turn out but indifferent, if a for|tunate accident had not happened which rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of the public, and in the end, proved of the greate&s;t advantage to the intere&s;ts of the drama.</P>
<P>As this was an event of much con&s;equence in theatrical hi&s;tory, productive of great good to the &s;tage, and which reflected the highe&s;t honour on the manager, I mu&s;t beg the reader's indul|gence with being a little particular on the &s;ub|ject. The following relation is chiefly taken from Mr. Victor, who was a witne&s;s to every tran&s;|action, and therefore mu&s;t have been well in|formed.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan although he had accompli&s;hed many &s;alutary reformations, and advanced the credit of the &s;tage into &s;uch high repute, yet was there one evil remaining, which &s;et his power at defiance, and that was the admi&s;&s;ion of gentlemen behind the &s;cenes, both at rehear&s;al and at night. Every idler who wore a laced coat, as lace was then in fa&s;hion, thought it entitled him to this privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="201">It was then the cu&s;tom for the young gen|tlemen of the college, to crowd every morning to rehear&s;al, and many times have the poor di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed actors been &s;een rehear&s;ing within a circle of forty or fifty of tho&s;e gentlemen who&s;e time ought to have been better employed. At night they u&s;ed to take a pride in &s;tanding on the &s;tage in &s;ight of the audience, indulging them&s;elves in very improper liberties, and often di&s;turbing the performance with their irregularities.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan long wi&s;hed to quell this hydra, but was afraid of the encounter. Cu&s;tom, time immemorial, had &s;anctified this breach of all order and decency, and the privilege was too plea&s;ing and too much extended to expect it to be quietly re&s;igned.</P>
<P>Many pages were written on the &s;ubject, to prove, "that a well regulated theatre is an honour as well as advantage to a kingdom. That it is the mo&s;t certain means of giving &s;trangers a high opinion of our good &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, and at the &s;ame time accommodating the nobility and gentry with that entertainment which they not only had a right to enjoy, but which, if they were di&s;appointed of here, they would certainly
<PB N="171" REF="202">
remove to another kingdom to obtain; that therefore it was highly nece&s;&s;ary the legi&s;lature &s;hould take the theatre under their protection, and &s;ecure it from the in&s;olence of wanton and di&s;&s;olute men."</P>
<P>But every public and private remon&s;trance were treated with contempt; many methods were propo&s;ed, but all ineffectual.&mdash;At length chance brought about what de&s;ign had never been able to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>At the repre&s;entation of the comedy of Ae&s;op, written by Sir John Vanbrugh, on the 19th of January 1746-7, a young gentleman of the name of Kelly, went to the pit much intoxicated with liquor, an indecency at that time too frequent there, when climbing over the &s;pikes, he got upon the &s;tage, and very &s;oon made his way to the green-room where &s;everal of the female per|formers were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Unawed by the decorum which con&s;tantly reigned there, he addre&s;&s;ed Mrs. Dyer an actre&s;s of excellent character, in &s;uch gro&s;s and indecent terms, as obliged all the women quickly to retire and take refuge in their dre&s;&s;ing-rooms. Thither
<PB N="172" REF="203">
he pur&s;ued them, and on being refu&s;ed admit|tance, made &s;uch a noi&s;e as di&s;turbed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tage then going forward. Mi&s;s Bellamy who played Doris, being then wanted to go on was afraid to venture out, till Mr. Sheridan dre&s;&s;ed for his character of Ae&s;op, had the of|fender taken away and conducted back to the pit.</P>
<P>Enraged at his di&s;appointment, this intrepid hero took a ba&s;ket of oranges which &s;tood-near him, and the next time the manager came on the &s;tage, amu&s;ed him&s;elf by throwing them at him. Mr. Sheridan ju&s;tly provoked at the in|dignity offered him, in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed the au|dience for protection, who immediately inter|fered, and with &s;ome difficulty &s;ilenced Mr. Kelly, but not before he had loudly and repeatedly, called Mr. Sheridan &s;coundrel and ra&s;cal! Who with the mo&s;t becoming &s;pirit and propriety an|&s;wered <HI>"I am as good a gentleman as you are."</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the play was over Mr. Kelly not content with the mi&s;chief he had already occa|&s;ioned, forced his way in at the &s;tage door, and up to Mr. Sheridan's dre&s;&s;ing-room, and there repeated the names he had &s;o liberally be&s;towed on him from the pit: this naturally provoked
<PB N="173" REF="204">
Mr. Sheridan, though &s;o even tempered, to &s;trike him &s;everal times, which the doughty hero took with the utmo&s;t patience, and retired to a club of his companions, to whom he related his &s;ad di&s;|a&s;ter, who, incen&s;ed that a <HI>&s;coundral player</HI> &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;trike a <HI>gentleman,</HI> united in denouncing vengeance again&s;t the offending manager, and all who &s;hould take his part.</P>
<P>A few nights after, Mr. Sheridan being adver|ti&s;ed for Horatio in the Fair Penitent, their threats had &s;uch an effect on him, that at the par|ticular reque&s;t of many of his friends, he declin|ed going to the theatre that evening, and re|que&s;ted Mr. Dyer to go on the &s;tage, and by acquainting the audience with his rea&s;ons, to apologize for his conduct: This was no &s;ooner performed than about fifty of the party with Kelly at their head, ro&s;e up in the pit, and climbing over the &s;pikes on the &s;tage, went directly to the green-room, from thence to all the dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, broke open tho&s;e that were locked, ran up to the wardrobe and thru&s;t their &s;words into all the che&s;ts and pre&s;&s;es of cloths, by way of <HI>feeling,</HI> they &s;aid, if Sheridan was concealed there. After many of the&s;e acts of violence, a party went off to his hou&s;e in Dor&s;et-&s;treet, but upon
<PB N="174" REF="205">
finding he had provided for their reception, they thought proper to retire.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action was on a Thur&s;day night. The next day it was the general topic of public conver&s;ation through the city. Parties ran high, and though the &s;ober and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate took the manager's part, numbers were not wanting who, either through family connections or a &s;pirit of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, threatened revenge in all public places. On the Saturday morning, the fol|lowing letter appeared in Faulkner's Journal, written unknown to the manager, by Mr. Victor.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. FAULKNER,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>Dublin,</HI> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 25, 1746.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>As the character and conduct of Mr. She|ridan are, by a late unhappy accident become the univer&s;al topic of all conver&s;ation in this metropolis, I am therefore induced, by a late in|timacy with him, to give the public, by your pa|per, a portrait of this actor.</P>
<P>He is the &s;on of the late Rev. Dr. Sheridan, a gentleman that was well known in this king|dom. This, his &s;on, was early &s;ent in life to
<PB N="175" REF="206">
We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool in London, and, when fitted for the univer&s;ity, was entered of this college, and cla&s;s-fellow with mo&s;t of the nobility and gentry of this kingdom of his time, and took his degree there of bachelor of arts. Well, then he was born and has had the education of a GENTLE|MAN&mdash;ay, but &s;ays the herald, he <HI>degraded</HI> him|&s;elf, when his fortunes, as well as his &s;ingular abilities, led him to the &s;tage. It may be &s;o. Though in my private thoughts, that opinion, though common, is like many others that are too ea&s;ily received by mankind, and built on a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is. However, that I may not ap|pear too &s;ingular, it &s;hall be granted. Well then, let us view him in this degraded light, be|cau&s;e this &s;urvey will be&s;t an&s;wer my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.&mdash;All the <HI>gentlemen</HI> I have hitherto met with, when degraded, have been lo&s;t to <HI>vir|tue,</HI> and have fallen a &s;acrifice to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and vices that drew them from the path of ho|nour; but this young man, as a proof that his fortunes alone threw him into this degraded light, remains in his moral character un&s;ullied. As the manager of the theatre (&s;ince that has been his province) his ambition has been to cul|tivate good manners and decency, and his la|bours and good example have hitherto been at|tended
<PB N="176" REF="207">
with good &s;ucce&s;s. The actors live in unu&s;ual harmony and have pur&s;ued their bu&s;i|ne&s;s with the utmo&s;t regularity; they are reward|ed with their &s;alaries; trade&s;men's bills are now punctually paid, and the town (it is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed) has been better entertained this winter than ever was known by &s;o thin a company of tolerable actors: to what can this be owing, but to the good conduct and ability of the ma|nager?</P>
<P>In his pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ion, I may &s;ay without flattery or partiality, that when we con&s;ider the variety of characters he appears in, he is arrived at an amazing degree of perfection for his years. In private life, when his labours have ble&s;t him with &s;ucce&s;s, I have known him to take more plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his relations and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friends, than the <HI>fine&s;t gentleman</HI> can pretend to enjoy in con&s;uming the bounties of fortune. But what avail the&s;e qualities, the&s;e mu&s;ty moral qualities? He has offended it &s;eems &s;ome GEN|TLEMEN, and how? why, in doing his duty as manager of the theatre; he met with an unex|pected and violent in&s;ult from a &s;ingle per&s;on in the pit (one whom he was obliged to order from behind the &s;cenes, after his indecent behaviour
<PB N="177" REF="208">
there) at a time when he was receiving the applau&s;es of the audience in the character of Ae&s;op. In this &s;urprize he was compelled to make an addre&s;s to the people, and in that di&s;order of mind, it &s;eems, he made u&s;e of <HI>one indecent word,</HI> that to the&s;e gentlemen was exceptionable.&mdash;Now, can any thing be more likely than to &s;uppo&s;e, in that confu&s;ion, <HI>he forgot he was a degraded man?</HI></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, any one of his <HI>gentlemen</HI> adver&s;aries &s;urpri&s;ed into a nece&s;&s;ity of addre&s;&s;|ing a public a&s;&s;embly: how few are there, out of a much larger body, that could &s;peak on the oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>unexceptionably?</HI> alas how few! But though I did not hear Mr. Sheridan that night, I can &s;afely depend on the judgment of two or three gentlemen of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>honour,</HI> who told me, that his behaviour, though provoked, was far from indecent or improper. However, it was by &s;ome gentlemen it &s;eems thought otherwi&s;e, and <HI>one word</HI> was di&s;placed, and for that, what had like to be his puni&s;hment? why, he was very near wanting all the &s;urgeons in Dublin to dre&s;s his wounds. O tempore! O mores!</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="209">In London, in the year 1722, a riot was committed at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, by a &s;et of profligate young men of quality, which &s;hut up that play-hou&s;e for eight or nine days. But the legi&s;lature (by the king's direc|tion) entered &s;o warmly into the affair, that the rioters thought proper to make the &s;uffering manager ample &s;atisfaction: and his maje&s;ty ordered a guard to attend that theatre from this accident, which Mr. Rich enjoys to this day.</P>
<P>At the la&s;t riot in Drury-lane theatre, in 1743, his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to give the &s;ame direction, and <HI>the lord chief ju&s;tice Lee</HI> declared from the bench, it was his opinion, that <HI>a conti|nual hi&s;&s;ing was a manife&s;t breach of the peace, as it was the beginning of a riot.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="179" REF="210">The tendency of this early letter, was to &s;et the people right, and to give a favourable, though ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Sheridan's conduct, how|ever it was was &s;oon an&s;wered, and within a month (the time the di&s;pute la&s;ted) there were as many pamphlets publi&s;hed as would make a large octavo volume. The whole company, nay, the whole kingdom, were at la&s;t engaged in this quarrel, which not only threatened the ruin of all who&s;e bread was depending on the theatre, but the lives and fortunes of many without doors, who were &s;o ra&s;h as to engage publicly in the affair, which was nothing more than the honour of an actor, but his cau&s;e was a noble one, a de|fence of decency, and the decorum of the &s;tage; in <HI>which he was &s;upported by all per&s;ons of worth and honor,</HI> and <HI>by the laws of his country.</HI></P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, a mo&s;t noble &s;pirit was rai&s;ed and diffu&s;ed throughout the city, I may &s;ay the whole kingdom, with great rapidity. This &s;pirit fir&s;t &s;hewed it&s;elf at the repre&s;ent|ing the tragedy of Richard the Third, adverti&s;ed for the fir&s;t trial play, after the grand riot, and as it was the fir&s;t in&s;tance where the rights of the audience, and the duty and privileges of the
<PB N="180" REF="211">
actors were freely a&s;&s;erted, it de&s;erves parti|cular notice.</P>
<P>When the play was adverti&s;ed, loud threats were uttered again&s;t the manager, and a general declaration, that he &s;hould never be permitted to play till he had made a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But the lovers of liberty and a free theatre, were not to be deprived of their favourite entertainment, by the unrea&s;onable humour of any &s;et of men; they looked upon the&s;e menacing dictates as &s;o many in&s;ults to the laws and to the public, and therefore re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the&s;e &s;ons of riot and outrage to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>The principal inhabitants al&s;o began at this juncture to a&s;&s;emble, and re&s;olved to encourage and protect the manager. Several citizens ad|vanced in years, who were &s;eldom &s;een at a theatre, were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the advantages and importance of a well regulated &s;tage, that they declared to Mr. Sheridan and his friends, that they would now more than ever, appear there, and doubted not being able to protect the mana|ger, and the actors in general, in the di&s;charge of their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="212">With a&s;&s;urances of this kind, and a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of his being in the right, Mr. Sheridan con|&s;ented to the performance of Richard. The hou&s;e filled earlier than u&s;ual. There was a brilliant appearance of ladies, gentlemen, and citizens of eminence, and no &s;mall number of the youths of the univer&s;ity. The&s;e were di&s;|per&s;ed throughout the theatre, but chiefly in the pit; yet in &s;uch a manner, that tho&s;e who be&s;t knew faces, could &s;ee no room to &s;u&s;pect any thing like a concerted a&s;&s;embly, however they might afterwards have been found to agree in &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Whether the author of this di&s;turbance was acquainted with this di&s;po&s;ition of the audience or not, is not certain, but it will appear he was not prepared for the reception which his riotous propo&s;als received. His friends came to the hou&s;e late, in &s;mall but well known groupes, and placed them&s;elves chiefly in the boxes. Their leaders either were not in town, or had not time to collect them&s;elves, and &s;ettle their plan of operation.</P>
<P>The play opened with great quietne&s;s; but at the latter end of the fir&s;t act, when Richard ap|peared,
<PB N="182" REF="213">
a confu&s;ed noi&s;e was heard from differ|ent parts, but chiefly from the boxes, of a <HI>&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, off, off, off.</HI> Mr. Sheridan advanced with re&s;pectful bows to the audience, but was prevented &s;peaking by louder and more di&s;tinct &s;ounds of, <HI>no &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, go on with the play.</HI></P>
<P>At this critical moment Lucas the celebrated Charles, then well known for his glorious &s;truggles in the cau&s;e of liberty, ro&s;e up in the pit, and a&s;&s;ert|ed the rights of the audience, and the freedom of the &s;tage. He expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment and dete&s;tation of men bringing their <HI>private quarrels</HI> with managers or players, into the theatre, and &s;uch he apprehended the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to be; but &s;ince the di&s;pute was introduced, it mu&s;t, like other di&s;putes, there be determined by the majority. He pre&s;umed every <HI>&s;ober per|&s;on in the hou&s;e came to receive the entertainment promi&s;ed in the bills, for which he paid his money at the door. The actors then, he ob&s;erved, were the &s;ervants of the audience, and under their pro|tection during that performance; and he looked upon every in&s;ult or interruption given to them in the di&s;charge of their duty, as offered to the audi|ence.</HI> He apprehended the matter in di&s;|pute,
<PB N="183" REF="214">
was no breach of the duty of the manager or actors, cognizable to any per&s;ons pre&s;ent; but whether it were &s;o, or thought otherwi&s;e by the hou&s;e, the que&s;tion might ea&s;ily be deter|mined. He therefore moved that tho&s;e who were for pre&s;erving the decency and freedom of the &s;tage, &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the holding up of hands, judging, that when they &s;hould come to know their numbers and &s;uperi|ority, they would &s;ilence or turn out their oppo|nents.</P>
<P>He was heard with great re&s;pect, and &s;aluted with &s;houts of applau&s;e, and on a divi&s;ion, the numbers were &s;o great again&s;t the rioters, that afraid of the con&s;equences, they &s;uddenly went off, and left the performance of that night in quiet.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS repul&s;ed they re&s;olved &s;till upon further vengeance. The manager and tho&s;e who took his part, were doomed to de&s;truction. The fir&s;t per&s;on they &s;ingled out, was Mr. Lucas, who &s;o nobly &s;poke in the defence of the rights of the audience and the &s;tage. A num|ber of tho&s;e gentlemen a&s;&s;aulted him one night &s;oon after this in the &s;treets. Next day he pub|li&s;hed an adverti&s;ement, which was di&s;tributed all over the city, informing the public, that a
<PB N="185" REF="216">
number of rude di&s;orderly per&s;ons, in the habits of gentlemen, who had for &s;ome time pa&s;t in|fe&s;ted the public places of the city, and di&s;turb|ed the peace of the theatre, had a&s;&s;aulted him, and offering a reward of five pounds to be paid on the apprehending and convicting any of tho&s;e offenders.</P>
<P>Before this riot began, the Fair Penitent had been adverti&s;ed for the annual benefit of the ho&s;pital for incurables, and the governors, who were all per&s;ons of con&s;equence, demanding the performance of their benefit play, &s;ent the ma|nager (who was to perform the part of Horatio) word, that they would take upon them to de|fend him that night; re&s;ting a&s;&s;ured no &s;et of men would oppo&s;e a charity play, e&s;pecially as all the ladies of quality exerted their intere&s;ts, and were to honour it with their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The bills were accordingly po&s;ted up, and the governors went early to the theatre with their white wands. The boxes and pit would have been filled with ladies, if about thirty gentlemen had not early taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the middle of two or three benches, near the &s;pikes of the orche&s;|tra. There were above an hundred ladies
<PB N="186" REF="217">
&s;eated on the &s;tage, and when the curtain drew up, nothing could equal the brilliant appearance of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the entrance of Mr. Sheridan, (who had the honour of being u&s;her'd in by the governors) tho&s;e thirty men, all armed, ro&s;e up in the pit, and ordered him off; they were joined by &s;ome few placed in both galleries. Mr. Sheridan im|mediately withdrew, and then violent di&s;putes began between the governors on the &s;tage, and the gentlemen in the pit, and &s;omething like challenges pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute now a&s;&s;umed a very &s;erious a&s;|pect. Among the governors was a &s;tudent of the univer&s;ity in his bachelor's gown, whom a gentleman near the &s;pikes of the pit, threw an apple at, and called a &s;coundrel, and (as he de|clared) &s;aid they were all a pack of &s;coundrels. Ju&s;tly incen&s;ed at this affront, away flew the &s;cholar to the college, and returned in about twenty minutes with as many youths armed for the combat. Luckily the rioters had mo&s;t fortunately left the pit a very few minutes before the &s;cholars arrived, and to prevent any further di&s;turbance, it was agreed by the ma|nagers
<PB N="187" REF="218">
of the charity and Mr. Sheridan to di&s;|mi&s;s the hou&s;e, &s;o they were obliged to return to the college.</P>
<P>The next day however, they &s;ei&s;ed &s;everal of the principal rioters, the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of|fender, was compelled to kneel down on his bare knees, in all the courts of the college, and to repeat a form they had prepared for him: the others were excu&s;ed kneeling, and only read their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and a&s;ked pardon of the col|lege.</P>
<P>The lords ju&s;tices now thought proper to in|terfere, and to order the ma&s;ter of the revels to &s;hut up the theatre by his authority, which was accordingly done. This was a wi&s;e and prudent &s;tep. The theatre was made the &s;eat of war, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee where the di&s;turb|ances might end.</P>
<P>And now the lawyers came in for their &s;hare of the quarrel. The young gentleman who began this was taken up for a&s;&s;aulting Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Sheridan was indicted for a&s;&s;aulting and beating the gentleman. Various were the reports, and wagers on the events of
<PB N="188" REF="219">
the&s;e trials. Nobody at that time would believe, that a jury could be found in Dublin that would find a GENTLEMAN <HI>guilty!</HI> However they were mi&s;taken. When the time drew near, the <HI>lord chief ju&s;tice Marlay</HI> &s;ent for the high &s;heriff, and directed him to make out, and bring a li&s;t of &s;ufficient and able jurors to his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The day appointed for the trials of both par|ties came on. The curio&s;ity of the public was rou&s;ed to a great degree. Mr. Sheridan ap|peared as the fir&s;t culprit, and was tried for a&s;&s;aulting and beating the gentleman, as Mr. Kelly was con&s;tantly &s;tiled in the di&s;pute. But it appearing fully to the jury, on the oaths of three or four men, who&s;e hone&s;ty was unque&s;|tioned, that the gentleman gave the manager &s;uch abu&s;ive and provoking language, in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, as compelled him to beat him out of it, and that no other per&s;on touched him, the jury acquitted the pri&s;oner without going out of the box.</P>
<P>Then the GENTLEMAN appeared at the bar, and many were the witne&s;&s;es examined: for &s;o many per&s;ons are employed behind the &s;cenes of a well regulated theatre, that there were a
<PB N="189" REF="220">
multitude of witne&s;&s;es to prove the facts charged in the indictment. In the cour&s;e of the trial, Mr. Sheridan was called upon the table, and when he was there, an&s;wering the que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him by the court and bench, a very eminent though not a very mannerly coun&s;ellor, on the &s;ide of the pri&s;oner, got up and &s;aid, <HI>"He wanted to &s;ee a curio&s;ity? I have often &s;een</HI> (continued he) <HI>a gentleman &s;oldier, and a gen|tleman taylor, but I have never &s;een a gentleman player."</HI> Mr. Sheridan, without the lea&s;t em|barra&s;&s;ment, mode&s;tly bowed, and &s;aid, <HI>"Sir, I hope you &s;ee one now."</HI> A loud murmur of applau&s;e ran through the court, and the coun|&s;ellor, notwith&s;tanding his effrontery, &s;at down aba&s;hed, and never a&s;ked him another que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Ju&s;tice Ward tried both the cau&s;es in the pre&s;ence of the lord chief ju&s;tice, and a full bench, who all &s;eemed in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of the chief ju&s;tice, to do every thing in their power to puni&s;h tho&s;e de&s;troyers of public liberty! In &s;hort the JURY found the GENTLE|MAN pri&s;oner GUILTY, and the &s;entence was, a <HI>fine of five hundred pounds, and three months impri&s;onment.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="221">After the &s;entence was given, the <HI>lord chief ju&s;tice</HI> was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that attention &s;hould be chiefly given to the conduct of tho&s;e gentlemen at the theatre, as that was the place of public re&s;ort, and added, <HI>That any per&s;on who forced his way behind the &s;cenes,</HI> WHERE MONEY WAS NOT TAKEN, if apprehended and brought before that court, and the fact-proved there, he SHOULD FEEL THE UTMOST SE|VERITY OF THE LAW.</P>
<P>This Mr. Kelly, when the law-&s;uit fir&s;t com|menced, imagined he &s;hould be liberally &s;up|ported, and hundreds &s;ub&s;cribed to carry it on, but upon conviction he found him&s;elf wholly de&s;erted, and after &s;uffering a week's confine|ment, became &s;o thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of his error, that he was obliged at la&s;t to apply to Mr. Sheridan, who in&s;tantly reque&s;ted government to relinqui&s;h the fine of 500l. which was granted him; and then became &s;olicitor and bail him|&s;elf to the court of king's bench for the enlarge|ment of the young gentleman.</P>
<P>Thus, ample redre&s;s was procured for the manager and actors, by obtaining <HI>that re&s;pect to be paid to the &s;cenes of the theatre-royal in Dublin,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="222">
which no other theatre till then had the hap|pine&s;s to maintain: for, from that hour not even the fir&s;t man of quality in the kingdom, ever a&s;ked or attempted to get behind the &s;cenes, and before that happy era, every per&s;on who was ma&s;ter of a &s;word, was &s;ure to draw it on the &s;tage door-keeper, if he denied him entrance.</P>
<P>And thus was the long u&s;urped tyranny of a &s;et of wanton, di&s;&s;olute gentlemen (the greate&s;t nui&s;ance that any city ever groaned under) effectually &s;ubdued, and the LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE RECOVERED BY A SPIRITED PUBLIC, AIDED BY A WORTHY LORD CHIEF JUSTICE AND AN HONEST JURY!</P>

There he engaged Mr. Woodward and the Mechels, then the be&s;t dancers on the &s;tage, for the following winter. The&s;e both proved of &s;ervice to the theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="224">Mr. Woodward made his fir&s;t appearance in the Bu&s;y Body, September 28th, 1747, and was well received by the public. He was at that time ri&s;ing into &s;ame, and even had great merit both as a comedian and harlequin; in the for|mer he &s;upported an exten&s;ive li&s;t of comedies with reputation, and being remarkably atten|tive to his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oon became a great favourite with the town.</P>
<P>But the manager had great expectations from his pantomimes, in which he principally excell|ed. By agreement he was to revive two or three old pantomimes, and to get up a new one at a limited expence. It has been a general ob&s;ervation which long experience has confirm|ed, that in Ireland tho&s;e &s;ort of entertainments have not the &s;ame force or attraction as in Lon|don; and the manager of Dublin, who em|barks largely in &s;uch undertakings, generally finds they do not &s;ufficiently reimbur&s;e him for his trouble and expence.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. The revived pantomimes, though well got up, added but little to the receipts of the theatre, and the new one, though brought out in the month
<PB N="194" REF="225">
of February after the town had been properly prepared and adverti&s;ed, was played to an audience under 100l. The &s;econd night it was tacked to Mr. Sheridan and Mi&s;s Bellamy in the Fair Penitent, yet were the receipts not above twenty pounds. However, altogether it proved a profitable &s;ea&s;on to the manager, and the be|nefits, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Woodward, were in general good.</P>
<P>At the end of March, Mr. Sheridan took another trip to London, to provide for the fol|lowing &s;ea&s;on, and left Mr. Victor, deputy ma|nager, the trouble of appointing, &s;ettling, and &s;ecuring the charges of the &s;everal benefit plays; a bu&s;ine&s;s not ea&s;y to accompli&s;h with &s;o large a body of people, who each have at &s;uch times, &s;eperate intere&s;ts of their own, which re|quire a manager's utmo&s;t addre&s;s to accom|modate.</P>
<P>Elated with his &s;ucce&s;s, and flattered by the idea of being able to rai&s;e the &s;tage to a greater degree of eminence, Mr. Sheridan now launch|ed out into expen&s;ive engagements, which the Iri&s;h theatre, at that time, was not able to repay. Among&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e, his
<PB N="195" REF="226">
agreement with Mr. and Mrs. Macklin &s;tood foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps it can hardly be credited at this day, that the receipts of the Dublin theatre could in|duce its manager to give them eight hundred pounds per annum for two years. Yet in &s;uch high e&s;timation did the pre&s;ent father of the &s;tage &s;tand upwards of forty years ago! 'Tis true the manager was a lo&s;er by this engagement, as he was by &s;everal others, which he entered into at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>As mu&s;ical pieces began then to be the fa&s;hion, Mr. Sheridan re&s;olved to &s;pare no ex|pence in pre&s;enting the public with the be&s;t en|tertainment in that line he could po&s;&s;ibly pro|cure. Accordingly he engaged Mr. Lampe, who was e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t compo&s;ers of the time. Signor Pa&s;quali, a remarkable fine performer on the violin, for the leader of his band. Mrs. Lampe, Mrs. Storer, Mrs. Mozeen, Mr. Howard, and Mr. Sullivan, all capital in mu&s;ical performances. The &s;alaries of all the&s;e amounting to the enormous &s;um of fourteen hundred pounds each &s;ea&s;on, was a total lo&s;s to the manager, as the profits of their performances
<PB N="196" REF="227">
did not reach to one hundred and fifty pounds, which was paid for the writing of their mu|&s;ic.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Macklin brought money. His Shylock, Sir Paul Plyant, Mi&s;er; Ben in Love for Love; Sir Gilbert Wrangle in the Refu&s;al; Scrub in the Stratagem; Trinculo in the Tem|pe&s;t, &amp;c. were ma&s;terly pieces of acting, and univer&s;ally admired. Mrs. Macklin's Lappet, Lady Wrangle, Lady Wronghead, Nur&s;e in Romeo, and characters in that &s;tyle, had great merit. The be&s;t of Mr. Sheridan's engagements for that &s;ea&s;on was Mrs. Bland, &s;ince Mrs. Hamilton; &s;he was a very u&s;eful actre&s;s, went through a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s both in tragedy and comedy very re&s;pectably, and had but a moderate &s;alary.</P>
<P>This winter Henry Brooke, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> author of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, produced an allegorical piece called Jack the Giant Queller. The high repu|tation of the author made Mr. Sheridan em|brace the offer of exhibiting it with great plea|&s;ure. The utmo&s;t attention was be&s;towed on preparing it for repre&s;entation, it drew a croud|ed hou&s;e, was well performed, and went off with
<PB N="197" REF="228">
much applau&s;e; but &s;uch was the &s;pirit of party at that time, that the next morning, by order of the lords ju&s;tices, who &s;ent their prohibi|tion to the manager, the piece was immediately withdrawn. The rea&s;on given for this extra|ordinary proceeding was, that in &s;everal of the &s;ongs, &s;atirical hints were thrown out again&s;t bad governors, lord mayors, and aldermen. A few years afterwards, when the times were more tranquil, this piece was revived, when it appeared it bad not genuine merit enough to en&s;ure its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;ea&s;on a lady of good family appeared by the name of Danvers, in the character of Indiana, and was received with &s;ingular marks of indulgence and approbation. Some time after &s;he played Monimia, Athenais, Sigi&s;munda, &amp;c. with reputation. In about a year after|wards &s;he married Mr. Victor, and retired from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The manager, during the cour&s;e of this &s;ea&s;on, experienced that his receipts were not equal to his expenditures; and towards the clo&s;e of it the theatre &s;u&s;tained a great lo&s;s in being deprived of Mi&s;s Bellamy, then a very great favourite
<PB N="198" REF="229">
with the town. Mr. Garrick, from the many opportunities he had of &s;eeing her abilities when they performed together in 1746, was too well convinced of her merit not to u&s;e every means to engage her; accordingly he made her propo&s;als, which &s;he immediately accepted, and &s;he returned to London, where &s;he remained &s;ome years in high reputation.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of this campaign, Mr. Brookes's alteration of Bankes's E&s;&s;ex, was brought cut with much &s;ucce&s;s. And I &s;hall clo&s;e my account of it with the following bill, as the company, the en&s;uing winter, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a&s;&s;umed a new face, and was &s;trength|ened with a reinforcement of &s;everal capital per|formers.</P>

<P><PB N="200" REF="231">The manager having &s;u&s;tained a heavy lo&s;s by his agreement with the mu&s;ical party, of which another year remained, and dreading the weight of their &s;alaries for the next winter, he very judiciou&s;ly contrived to transfer them to the mu&s;ical &s;ociety, then held at the mu&s;ic-hall in Fi&s;hamble-&s;treet, for which profitable relea&s;e he received three hundred guineas, being the a|mount of the yearly &s;ub&s;cription of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Thus freed, Mr. Sheridan was at liberty to &s;eek for fre&s;h entertainment for the public, and he was happy in his choice. The en&s;uing cam|paign was one of the mo&s;t brilliant that had then ever been known in Dublin. The theatre opened on his maje&s;ty's birth day, November 1749, with the Comedy of Love for Love; Va|lentine, Mr. Sheridan; Ben, Mr. Macklin; Mi&s;s Price, Mi&s;s Ma&s;on; and Angelica, Mrs. Bland.</P>
<P>Mr. Theophilus Cibber, then in great e&s;tima|tion in London, paid Ireland a &s;econd vi&s;it this &s;ea&s;on, and added much to the &s;trength of the comedies. A Mi&s;s Griffith, a tolerable actre&s;s, made her fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage at this time. But what mu&s;t for ever render this
<PB N="201" REF="232">
period memorable to all lovers of the drama was, that it was marked by the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of two &s;uch capital performers as Mr. Digges and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op.</P>
<P>Few candidates for theatrical fame ever en|tered the li&s;ts with greater expectations, or ex|cited general curio&s;ity more than Mr. Digges. His family connections, and the many &s;ingular circum&s;tances which marked his entrance into life, were &s;o well known to the fa&s;hionable world, that his fir&s;t entre on the &s;tage engaged the attention of the polite&s;t circles. As the fol|lowing anecdotes relative to this gentleman, which I received from unque&s;tionable authority, have never before been made public, I hope they will prove acceptable to my readers.</P>
<P>We&s;t Digges, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was born about the year 1720, a period, which I before ob&s;erved, was made remarkable by giving birth to Garrick, Barry and Sheridan. His father was colonel Digges of the guards, a gentleman of family and fortune, and nearly allied to &s;ome of the fir&s;t nobility in England. With many others, he ra&s;hly engaged deeply in the fatal South Sea &s;cheme, which involved &s;o many families in
<PB N="202" REF="233">
ruin, in the year 1721. The con&s;equence was the entire lo&s;s of a large paternal e&s;tate in Kent, which he was obliged to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P>He did not long &s;urvive this wreck of his fortune. At his death, he left his children, two &s;ons, of whom We&s;t was the elde&s;t, to the guardian&s;hip of the pre&s;ent duke of Montague, and the late Earl De Lawarr. To the title and e&s;tate of the latter, young Digges was at that time, and for many years after, pre&s;umptive heir.</P>
<P>By the time he had reached his eighteenth year, an event happened which at once put an end to his expectations re&s;pecting the family title and e&s;tate. This was the birth of the pre&s;ent Earl De Lawarr. So &s;evere and un|expected a &s;troke made a total revolution in his circum&s;tances. The remains of his father's for|tune were too incon&s;iderable to &s;upport him in the &s;phere he had been accu&s;tomed to move in, and the old earl was not remarkable for his ge|nero&s;ity. He however bought the young di&s;in|herited Digges a commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ent him off to Scotland to join his regiment with &s;carce money enough to defray his expences. The
<PB N="203" REF="234">
younger brother was in like manner provided for in the navy, where he ro&s;e to the rank of captain of one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war.</P>
<P>The army is perhaps one of the wor&s;t &s;chools for a young man of fa&s;hion to learn oeconomy in. Military gentlemen in general, have, from a liberality of &s;entiment, too great a contempt for money. Mr. Digges, bred with &s;uch elevated views, and accu&s;tomed to &s;uch profu&s;ion, could not on this &s;udden change of fortune alter his mode of living, or contract his expences. In a few years whil&s;t he remained in Scotland he in|curred debts, which through life afterwards he was never able to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>Un&s;upported by his family he was obliged to return to London, where he &s;old his commi&s;&s;i|on. In all probability had he not taken this ra&s;h &s;tep, but remained in the army, his merit and connections would in time, have rai&s;ed him to the highe&s;t degree of eminence. In London he contracted an acquaintance with Theophilus Cibber, who introduced him to his father the laureat. This connection turned his views to|wards a theatrical life. The &s;tage di&s;played a thou&s;and charms to his imagination, and opened
<PB N="204" REF="235">
a &s;ource of inexhau&s;tible wealth. To apply to either of the London theatres he knew would be in vain; the intere&s;t of his family would prevent every attempt of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>There was at that time a treaty depending between Mr. Theophilus Cibber and Mr. She|ridan, Cibber therefore advi&s;ed him to try his fortune in Ireland, under the au&s;pices of &s;o libe|ral a manager. Mr. Digges readily embraced the idea, and on applying to Mr. Sheridan re|ceived every encouragement he po&s;&s;ibly could wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Mr. Digges po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t every requi&s;ite to form a great actor. Nature had bountifully be&s;towed her favours upon him. His figure was happily &s;uited to repre&s;ent the hero, lover, or man of fa&s;hion. His per&s;on was tall and elegant, yet manly; a countenance open yet ex|pre&s;&s;ive; an eye marking and full of vivacity. His addre&s;s was ea&s;y and engaging; his man|ners refined and poli&s;hed. He had received the mo&s;t liberal education, and he &s;eemed to have been formed in the &s;chool of Che&s;terfield; few men ever &s;acrificed more to the graces than Mr. Digges. No man was ever a greater fa|vourite
<PB N="205" REF="236">
with the fair, or a more plea&s;ing de&s;ira|ble companion among&s;t his own &s;ex.</P>
<P>His trial part was cho&s;en with judgment. It was Jaffier, a character which afforded ample &s;cope for his abilities. Wedne&s;day November 27th, 1749, the tragedy of Venice Pre&s;erved was adverti&s;ed: Pierre, Mr. Sheridan; Renault, Mr. Cibber; Belvidera, Mi&s;s Danvers; "and the part of Jaffier by Mr. Digges, a gentleman lately arrived from England, who never yet appeared on any &s;tage." Except Mr. Barry, the public had never till then beheld &s;o fini&s;hed a figure as Mr. Digges. His ea&s;y elegant deportment charmed his auditors. He &s;upported his character with feeling, tenderne&s;s, and variety, beyond expecta|tion, and they had only to regret a har&s;hne&s;s in his voice, which time afterwards harmonized prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Before the town had time to prai&s;e this new favourite, another adventurer was introduced to their notice. The very next evening announced the tragedy of the Revenge. "The part of Zanga by Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, a gentleman of this kingdom, who never appeared on any &s;tage." Perhaps there never was a more &s;triking con|tra&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="237">
than between the&s;e two competitors for public favour</P>
<P>Henry Mo&s;&s;op, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was born in the year 1729; his father was a clergyman in the coun|try of Ireland, of excellent character, and univer|&s;ally beloved. As he re&s;ided mo&s;tly at his rectory at Tuam, he &s;ent his &s;on Henry to Dublin to his brother, who kept a book&s;eller's &s;hop, who put him under the care of Mr. Butler, a clergyman, who kept a grammar &s;chool in Digges-&s;treet, Dublin; here he remained upwards of five years, till he was prepared to enter the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>During the time he remained there he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with diligence and credit, and after taking his degrees, he left the kingdom, being invited by an uncle to London, who promi&s;ed to provide for him. However his reception there not an&s;wering his expectations, and not having any brilliant pro&s;pects in view, his thoughts inclined him to try the &s;tage, to which he had long been attached whil&s;t in Ireland.</P>
<P>Full of this idea he offered him&s;elf fir&s;t to Mr. Garrick, and then to Mr. Rich, both of whom, after he had given them &s;pecimens
<PB N="207" REF="238">
of his abilities, pronounced him <HI>totally unfit for the &s;tage.</HI> And here I mu&s;t, though perhaps contrary to univer&s;al opinion, ju&s;tify the above gentlemen, and managers in general, from the &s;evere imputations they lie under from the many performers whom in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s they are forced to reject; at the &s;ame time I am obliged to condemn the mode of trial gene|rally adopted on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>A lady or gentleman with a high opinion of their own abilities, confirmed by a few partial friends, who perhaps have neither ta&s;te nor judgment, think they have nothing to do but apply to the manager, who mu&s;t be blind indeed if he does not in&s;tantly coincide with their own and friends opinion, and that all they have to do, is to repeat a few &s;peeches, or &s;ing a few &s;ongs, when they will be in&s;tantly accepted; that then they appear in public, are admired beyond any degree of compari&s;on with tho&s;e now on the &s;tage, and that their fortune is in|&s;tantly made.</P>
<P>This delirium takes entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; they gain an audience of the manager; good manners obliges him to treat them with re&s;pect;
<PB N="208" REF="239">
they urge their claims, and he naturally de&s;ires them to give a &s;pecimen of their different talents. Perhaps there is not in nature a more ludicrous &s;cene than on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The awkwardne&s;s of the &s;ituation throws the young candidates into a variety of unnatural attitudes, whil&s;t fear generally takes away their powers, and throws them into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The manager, not finding that merit he ex|pected, di&s;mi&s;&s;es them with a cold promi&s;e of a di&s;tant day, or a wi&s;h that in a country company they would for &s;ome time, acquire a more inti|mate acquaintance with the drama. Thus re|pul&s;ed, they never conceive them&s;elves deficient, but lay the whole blame on the manager's want of judgment. And yet I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that had Mr. Garrick been de&s;ired to give a &s;pe|cimen of his abilities in &s;uch a predicament, that the be&s;t judges living could not have formed a proper opinion of what he afterwards proved.</P>
<P>But to return. Rejected by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Rich, Mo&s;&s;op next applied to a friend and &s;chool-fellow of his, then an actor in Smock-alley Theatre, to mention him to Mr. Sheridan.
<PB N="209" REF="240">
This friend was Mr. Francis Gentleman, a man of genius and abilities, who about a year before had made his appearance in Aboan. Mr. Sheridan gave Mr. Mo&s;&s;op a cordial invitation; he came over and had his choice of parts, and very judiciou&s;ly cho&s;e Zanga in the Revenge, in which he di&s;played an a&s;toni&s;hing degree of beautiful wildne&s;s. His action was what in &s;ome mea&s;ure it ever remained, awkward and unpicture&s;que. The pit was crouded with col|legians, who &s;upported their fellow &s;tudent in the warme&s;t manner, and though through his performance an untutored manner predominated, yet at times &s;uch extraordinary marks of genius broke forth, as evidently indicated his future greatne&s;s, and confirmed his friends and the audience in the &s;anguine expectations they had formed of his abilities.</P>
<P>Dramatic entertainments had now arrived to a perfection often wi&s;hed but never expected in Ireland. The public beheld united in one the|atre, the names of Sheridan, Mo&s;&s;op, Digges, Macklin, Cibber, Ro&s;s, Elrington, Bardin, Mor|gan, Sparks, Kennedy, Sullivan, Howard, Beam&s;ly. Mrs. Bland, Mrs. Macklin, Mi&s;s Danvers, Mi&s;s Griffith, Mrs. Storer, Mrs.
<PB N="210" REF="241">
Lampe, Mrs. Mozeen, Mrs. Kennedy, be&s;ides others of le&s;s note. The tragedies in general were mo&s;t capitally &s;upported. In Julius Cae&s;ar Mr. Sheridan played Brutus; Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, Ca&s;&s;ius, and Mr. Digges, Antony. In the Or|phan, Chamont, Sheridan; Ca&s;talio, Digges; Polydore, Mo&s;&s;op; Chaplain, Cibber; Moni|mia, Mi&s;s Danvers. In Jane Shore, Ha&s;tings, Digges; Glo&s;ter, Mo&s;&s;op; Dumont, Sheridan; Jane Shore, Danvers; Alicia, Bland.</P>
<P>With &s;o capital a company, no wonder that this was a mo&s;t profitable and brilliant &s;ea&s;on to the manager; at the clo&s;e of it he found his receipts increa&s;ed two thou&s;and pound beyond any of the preceding years.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Macklin's agreement concluding with the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, he collected a very excellent company, and opened a temporary theatre in Che&s;ter, where he performed &s;everal months during the &s;ummer with great &s;ucce&s;s. To re|pair his lo&s;s the manager entered into &s;everal engagements of con&s;equence. The opening of
<PB N="212" REF="243">
the next campaign, September the 19th 1750, pre&s;ented Mi&s;s Cole, a very plea&s;ing little actre&s;s from Drury-lane, in I&s;abella in the Bu&s;y Body, and Mi&s;s Lucy in the Virgin Unma&s;ked.</P>
<P>Two capital dancers from Paris, Mon&s;ieur Billioni, and Madam Paget, were added to Mon|&s;ieur Granier and Mi&s;s Baker, who altogether formed an excellent group, and gave great en|tertainment. But Mr. Sheridan's principal novelty was Mr. Thomas King, from Drury-lane theatre, who, though then a very young man, was allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s an extraordinary &s;hare of merit, and deemed a valuable acqui&s;i|tion to any theatre. He made his fir&s;t appear|ance in the character of Ranger in the Su&s;pi|cious Hu&s;band, and was highly approved of by the town. This excellent comedian remained &s;everal years in Ireland, improving every day in his profe&s;&s;ion, and the e&s;teem of the public. His many virtues in private, joined to his abi|lities on the &s;tage, de&s;ervedly gained him the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who were &s;o for|tunate as to be intimate with him.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the theatrical appearances which mark the early part of this &s;ea&s;on, we find the
<PB N="213" REF="244">
name of Mr. James Robert&s;on, who performed the little comic part of Snap in Love's La&s;t Shift, being his fir&s;t appearance on any &s;tage. I hope my reader will pardon me if I embrace the opportunity of introducing this gentleman to their acquaintance, and at the &s;ame time pay a ju&s;t tribute to a very worthy character.</P>
<P>Mr. James Robert&s;on is a native of Ireland, and de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed one of its ornaments. He is de&s;cended from a re&s;pectable family, and received a liberal education. A love of &s;cience and the belles lettres early di&s;tingui&s;hed his character. When a young man he bore a con|&s;iderable part in compiling, dige&s;ting, and writing that voluminous ma&s;s of information, the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory. With the profits ari&s;ing from this work he purcha&s;ed an annuity for the life of a wife tenderly beloved, and whom he had the misfortune to lo&s;e in a year or two after|wards.</P>
<P>Chance &s;ome years afterwards conducted him to the York theatre, of which he continued up|wards of twenty years a mo&s;t valuable mem|ber. During that time he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with occa&s;ional excur&s;ions in the fields of Fancy, and
<PB N="214" REF="245">
culling flowers on the mount of Parna&s;&s;us. Several of his novels, tales, prologues, epilogues, &amp;c. have great merit. As an actor his abili|ties lay chiefly in the comic line, in which I will venture to &s;ay few excelled him. For &s;ome years pa&s;t he has retired from the &s;tage, and now advanced in years enjoys the ble&s;&s;ings of a moderate independent competence, amid&s;t a number of friends who honour and e&s;teem him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the excellence of the com|pany, the receipts this &s;ea&s;on, though far from being bad, were not equal to tho&s;e of the la&s;t. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and Mr. Digges &s;till continued great favourites with the public, yet their novelty was worn off, and the curio&s;ity of the town abated. Before the &s;ea&s;on was near over a mi&s;under&s;tanding aro&s;e between the manager and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, which ended in the latter ab|ruptly quitting Ireland, and engaging with Mr. Garrick at Drury-lane.</P>
<P>Though I willingly bear te&s;timony of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's merit, yet ju&s;tice obliges me to confe&s;s, that he had &s;everal peculiarities in his di&s;po&s;ition which rendered it not ea&s;y to live on terms of
<PB N="215" REF="246">
friend&s;hip with him. The following anec|dote told of him by his friend Mr. Gentlemen, may among&s;t many be &s;elected to &s;hew his ca|pricious haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>After performing the character of Zanga for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights at his fir&s;t on&s;et, he cho&s;e Richard for his fourth appearance, and mo&s;t unaccountably dre&s;&s;ed the character in white &s;atin puckered. Mr. Sheridan ju&s;tly ob|&s;erving that it had a mo&s;t coxcombly appear|ance, the remark reached Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's ear, who next morning went to the manager's room, and mo&s;t emphatically addre&s;&s;ed him thus: <HI>"Mr. She-ri-dan,</HI> I hear you &s;aid I dre&s;&s;ed Richard like a <HI>Cox-comb:</HI> that is an <HI>af-front:</HI> you wear a &s;word, pull it out of the <HI>&s;cab-bard;</HI> I'll draw mine, and thru&s;t it into your <HI>bo-dy."</HI> This fu|rious attack Mr. Sheridan &s;miled at, an expla|nation took place, and the affair had an amica|ble conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The departure of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op was a lo&s;s to the theatre, however it was amply compen&s;ated by the engagements of the en&s;uing winter. On Monday October 7th, 1751, was introduced to the knowledge of the public, Tottenham
<PB N="216" REF="247">
Heaphy, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable cha|racters that ever graced public or private life. This gentleman, who is &s;prung from a very good family in the &s;outh of Ireland, early in life en|tered into the &s;ervice of his king and country, and in Ligonier's hor&s;e, then e&s;teemed the fine&s;t regiment in Europe, &s;erved &s;everal campaigns in Flanders under the late duke of Cumberland. At the conclu&s;ion of the peace in 1748, being at liberty to follow the bent of his inclinations, his genius led him to the &s;tage, for which his figure and abilities well qualified him. He per|formed a few nights at Capel-&s;treet theatre, but his fir&s;t appearance at Smock-alley, was in the character of Manley, in the Provoked Hu&s;band, in which he was very favourably received, and proved the many years he continued on the &s;tage, a mo&s;t valuable &s;upport to the drama.</P>
<P>Mr. Davies, the author of the life of Garrick, and Mrs. Davies, a couple remarkable for their great utility, were al&s;o engaged by Mr. Sheri|dan, and came out in Sciolto, in the Fair Peni|tent, and Indiana. But what gave peculiar bril|liancy to the &s;ea&s;on, was the manager's engage|ment with Mi&s;s Woffington. This lady had per|formed, &s;ince &s;he left Dublin, at Covent-garden
<PB N="217" REF="248">
theatre, where &s;he had improved to a great degree, and &s;tood in high favour with the Lon|don audience.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1751, &s;he returned to Ireland, expecting, as the theatre was now e&s;tabli&s;hed on a permanent footing, to be en|gaged on her fir&s;t application. This however, Mr. Sheridan, who had not &s;een her for &s;everal years pa&s;t, &s;eemed at fir&s;t unwilling to do. At length, by the interpo&s;ition of &s;everal friends, to whom her merits were better known, he con|&s;ented to give her four hundred pound for the &s;ea&s;on, and &s;he appeared for the fir&s;t time in Lady Townly, on the &s;ame night that Mr. Heaphy performed Manly.</P>
<P>Her reception was &s;uch as &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of her friends, and a&s;to|ni&s;hed the manager, who was highly plea&s;ed with his acqui&s;ition. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the raptures the audience were in at be|holding &s;o beautiful, elegant and accompli&s;hed a woman, or the happy con&s;equences which re|&s;ulted to Mr. Sheridan. Her next character was Andromache, in the Di&s;tre&s;t Mother, in which Mr. Sheridan played Ore&s;tes; Mr. Digges,
<PB N="218" REF="249">
Pyrrhus; and Mrs. Bland Hermione. The hou&s;e was uncommonly crowded, and the &s;ame profu&s;ion of applau&s;e attended her performance throughout.</P>
<P>The public papers every day were filled with panegyrics, on her per&s;on, elegant deportment and inimitable acting. She was compared to Cae&s;ar; &s;he came, &s;he &s;aw, &s;he overcame. From the numerous productions of the day I have &s;elected one written by a gentleman of &s;ome eminence in the literary world.</P>

<P>Nor was her merit confined to one peculiar line of acting; her next character was Phillis in the Con&s;cious Lovers; Young Bevil, Sheridan; Myrtle, Digges; Tom, Mr. King; Cimberton, Mr. Cibber, and Indiana, Mi&s;s Davies. She afterwards performed Con&s;tance, King John; Cleopatra, All for Love; Lady Betty Modi&s;h, E&s;tifania, Ro&s;alind, Zara, Mourning Bride; and, to fini&s;h the round, Lothario, in the Fair Penitent.</P>
<P>But the parts in which &s;he peculiarly charmed the public, and continued to draw the mo&s;t crowded audiences to, were Charlotte, in Cib|ber's Nonjuror; Lady Townly, Hermione and

Sir Henry Wildair. Each of the&s;e very oppo|&s;ite characters, in which it was difficult to &s;ay which &s;he excelled mo&s;t in, &s;he repeated ten nights, and the receipts of the theatre, on the&s;e nights alone, amounted to upwards of four thou|&s;and pounds. On an average, an hundred pounds each night, an in&s;tance never known at that time, or perhaps &s;ince, on the Iri&s;h &s;tage, to four old &s;tock plays, as in the drama|tic phra&s;e they are denominated.</P>
<P>From the above circum&s;tances we may con|clude, that the &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t have proved uncom|monly profitable to the manager.

<P>To her honour be it ever remembered, that whil&s;t thus in the zenith of her glory, courted and care&s;&s;ed by all ranks and degrees, it made no alteration in her behaviour; &s;he remained the &s;ame gay, affable, obliging, good-natured

<P>Not the lowe&s;t performer in the theatre did &s;he refu&s;e playing for, out of twenty-&s;ix be|nefits, &s;he acted in twenty-four, and one of the other two was for Mrs. Lee, who cho&s;e to treat the town with an exhibition of her own Juliet.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In&s;titution of the Beef Stake Club.&mdash;Mrs. Wof|fington, pre&s;ident.&mdash;Mr. Sowdon, Mrs. Green, and Mr. Co&s;tello engaged.&mdash;Appearance of Mr. Dexter in Oroonako; Anecdotes relative to him.&mdash;The Theatre in great repute.&mdash;Spirit of Party appears.&mdash;Beef Stake Club noticed.&mdash;The Tragedy of Mahomet got up.&mdash;A Speech in it encored.&mdash;Play repeated.&mdash;Manager's Speech to the Performers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A VERY remarkable circum&s;tance occurred about this time, which, as it was productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to the &s;tage in Ire|land, ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; this was the in&s;titution of the Beef Stake Club.</P>
<P>As every community have their peculiar cu&s;|toms, &s;o in mo&s;t theatres, for time immemorial, the performers u&s;ed to devote one day in the week, generally Saturday, to dine together, and &s;pend a few hours in mirth and &s;ocial friendship; from this hint the manager formed his plan, but
<PB N="223" REF="254">
it differed widely in execution. The mem|bers it was compo&s;ed of were mo&s;tly lords or members of parliament, and amounted to thirty or forty in number.</P>
<P>A very large apartment in the manager's hou&s;e, adjoining the theatre, was dedicated to this convivial meeting, where every thing was furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t plenteous and elegant &s;tile at his expence: here, &s;trange to relate, the gay&punc; volatile, enchanting Woffington, being the only female admitted, was, by unanimous con|&s;ent, voted into the chair, which &s;he filled with a grace and ea&s;e peculiar to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>It will readily be believed, that &s;uch a &s;elect a&s;&s;embly enjoying &s;uch entertainment, free of all expence, and enlivened by the &s;prightly &s;allies and jeu d'e&s;prits of &s;o lovely a pre&s;ident, were as happy as any &s;et of mortals on earth could be; each indulged the hilarity of his di&s;po&s;ition, and all was wit, repartee and glee, happy for the theatre, if the public had beheld this a&s;&s;embly in its true light, harmle&s;s and void of all de|&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="255">But to return. Mr. Sheridan opened his next &s;ea&s;on, October 10th, 1752, with Mr. Digges's Macheath, and Mi&s;s Falkner's Polly. Mr. Digges has been thought by many to be the be&s;t Macheath who ever performed it; for my own part, though I confe&s;s he had great merit in the part, yet I could not help con&s;idering him as too excentric. Of Mi&s;s Falkner I know very little. The next night Mr. Sowdon made his fir&s;t ap|pearance in Othello, a character he had not many requi&s;ites for; and a few nights after introduced that excellent comic actre&s;s Mrs. Green, in the part of Flippanta, and Mr. Co&s;tollo in Money-trap, in the comedy of the City Wives Confede|racy.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the only new performers of merit engaged at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on. Mr. Sowdon remained many years on the Iri&s;h &s;tage, and though not an actor of the very fir&s;t merit, yet he &s;upported a variety of bu&s;ine&s;s with repu|tation, and always lived e&s;teemed and re&s;pected, Mrs. Green was ju&s;tly a great favourite, and much liked by the public, and at the end of her engagement the winter following, &s;he returned to London, where &s;he remained one of the fir&s;t comic actre&s;&s;es of her time.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="256">In May 1753 Mr. Dexter appeared in the cha|racter of Oroonoko, and Mrs. Woffington played the Widow Lackit: this gentleman was a native of Ireland, much about the &s;ame age of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, with whom he was &s;chool fellow, and afterwards fellow &s;tudent in Trinity College, Dublin. The fir&s;t trial of his abilities was about two years before, under Mr. Garrick, in Drury-lane, in the &s;ame character of Oroonoko; and it is remarked, by Mr. Davies, of him, that he was &s;o unconcerned about his approaching per|formance, that he continued in conver&s;ation with his friends in the pit, on the fir&s;t night of his performing, till the &s;econd mu&s;ic, which is ge|nerally played about half an hour beford the cur|tain is drawn up, put him in mind that it was time to think of the &s;tage apparatus.</P>
<P>The applau&s;e which Mr. Dexter gained in this fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay was beyond expectation; Mr. Gar|rick was &s;o charmed with the pro&s;pect of his &s;ucce&s;s, that he wrote to a friend, at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the capital, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms of the young actor's favourable reception, and de|clared he had wonderful expectations from the fir&s;t proof he had given of his abilities. Mr. Dexter continued to act Oroonoko &s;everal times
<PB N="226" REF="257">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively with applau&s;e, but it was ob&s;erved, that every time he acted, he abated in power to plea&s;e the audience: the public had been &s;urpriz|ed into an approbation which the actor wanted abilities to confirm.</P>
<P>Mr. Dexter, however, proved a valuable ac|qui&s;ition to the &s;tage, and though he &s;eldom ro&s;e above mediocrity, yet in the exten&s;ive round of characters which he performed, it could not be &s;aid he ever gave offence. His figure was tall and elegant, his addre&s;s ea&s;y, his manners gentle, mode&s;t and uniform; he lived univer&s;ally belov|ed, and many years after, when he died, was &s;incerely lamented.</P>
<P>I am now drawing near one of the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able events in theatric hi&s;tory, and which holds up a &s;triking picture of the uncertainty of this life. E&s;tabli&s;hed on the firme&s;t ba&s;is of conti|nued unequivocal public approbation, the manager fondly hoped he was now beginning to reap the de&s;erved harve&s;t of his &s;everal years uncea&s;ing toils. With infinite labour had he overcome all difficulties, and from the lowe&s;t depths of de|&s;pair, retrieved the honour of the &s;tage, nor did he de&s;i&s;t till he had rai&s;ed it to an eminence her
<PB N="227" REF="258">
&s;i&s;ter Britain was proud to own, nay even in &s;ome particulars to copy after.</P>
<P>At this time the theatre was the fa&s;hionable re|&s;ort of all ranks. Crowded every night with the fir&s;t characters in the kingdom, it was in reality a &s;ource of entertainment and in&s;truction. Its exhibitions might grace a Greek or Roman &s;tage. Propriety, order and decorum pre&s;ided over the whole. Its profe&s;&s;ors were held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation, admitted into the fir&s;t a&s;&s;emblies, and treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. <HI>Such were the effects of Mr. Sheridan's manage|ment.</HI></P>
<P>Unwillingly mu&s;t I quit &s;o plea&s;ing a portrait, to exhibit one of a very different complexion: mo&s;t unhappily for the drama, the &s;pirit of party had for &s;ome years pa&s;t been advancing with rapid &s;trides over this divided nation. The dae|mon of di&s;cord had lighted his infernal torch, and &s;cattered his de&s;tructive brands in every pro|vince of this di&s;tracted kingdom. Hitherto the mon&s;ter had not found entrance into the theatre, but once admitted, he plunged its inhabitants in|to the wor&s;t of calamities, and &s;pread de&s;olation through the whole.</P>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="228" REF="261">Mr. Sheridan's conduct as yet had defied the mo&s;t envenomed enquiry: from the innocent circum&s;tance of forming the celebrated Beef Stake Club, did the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences ari&s;e, and what at any other time would have pa&s;&s;ed unheeded, now gave the mo&s;t unpardon|able offence. 'Tis true the members were per|&s;ons generally attached to the court, and the u&s;ual routine of toa&s;ts drank on this occa&s;ion were of a &s;imilar complexion. But neither the founder, members, or lovely pre&s;ident ever de|&s;igned it as a &s;chool for politics, they un&s;u&s;pect|ingly enjoyed the pre&s;ent moment in all the de|lights which wit and mirth could in&s;pire.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had popular prejudice beheld him with a jaundiced eye, than his mo&s;t innocent actions were mi&s;con&s;trued into &s;ettled de&s;ign, and many idle &s;tories were circulated to his di&s;|advantage. At this very critical juncture, did the manager mo&s;t unluckily bring forward the tragedy of Mahomet. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed he had any particular de&s;ign in performing it at this time; on the contrary, it appears, that it was ca&s;t the &s;ea&s;on before, but laid a&s;ide as it was then too late, and would interfere with the be|nefits.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="262">However, no &s;ooner was it announced, than the oppo&s;ite party took the alarm, and re&s;olved to demon&s;trate their &s;entiments by publicly mark|ing whatever pa&s;&s;ages in the piece they thought applicable to their opinions. On Saturday Fe|bruary 2d, 1754, it was adverti&s;ed: Zaphna, Mr. Sheridan; Mahomet, Mr. Sowdon; Alca|nor, Mr. Digges, and Palmira, Mrs. Woffing|ton. The night of performance the hou&s;e filled directly, and in the pit were placed the leaders of oppo&s;ition. In the fir&s;t act Alcanor has this &s;peech, which at that time was deemed &s;o re|markably applicable:
<Q><L>If, ye powers divine!</L>
<L>Ye mark the movements of this nether world,</L>
<L>And bring them to account? Cru&s;h, cru&s;h tho&s;e vipers,</L>
<L>Who, &s;ingled out by the community</L>
<L>To guard their rights, &s;hall, for a gra&s;p of ore,</L>
<L>Or paltry office, &s;ell them to the foe.</L></Q></P>
<P>Scarce had he fini&s;hed this &s;peech, when a loud encore from the pit hindered the perform|ance from proceeding. Mr. Digges amazed and confounded at &s;o unprecedented and unexpected a de&s;ire, was for &s;ome moments unable to deter|mine,
<PB N="230" REF="263">
but the encore continuing with encrea&s;ing violence, he at length complied with its voice, and &s;poke the whole &s;peech over again: this triumph obtained, their applau&s;e was unbounded, and the performance &s;uffered to continue, with this remarkable circum&s;tance, that during the remainder, their great favourites Mr. Sheridan and Mrs. Woffington, went through their &s;cenes, which are the fine&s;t in the play, without the lea&s;t notice, whil&s;t the character of Alcanor, on every occa&s;ion, was marked with their loude&s;t approbation.</P>
<P>As this &s;eemed evidently the work of party, it is a&s;toni&s;hing, and at this time unaccountable, why the manager &s;uffered this objectionable piece to be again given out; &s;orry I am to &s;ay, that in this fatal in&s;tance his u&s;ual prudence and good &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to have totally de&s;erted him. A manager, as he is the &s;teward of the public at large, ought carefully to avoid attaching him&s;elf to any particular intere&s;t; but when matters were &s;o enflamed, that even the mo&s;t rational per&s;ons were prejudiced, and could not rea&s;on coolly on political &s;ubjects, to throw &s;uch an op|portunity in their way, &s;eems, at this day, an un|accountable infatuation.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="264">The rea&s;ons he afterwards a&s;&s;igned appeared totally in&s;ufficient; they were, "that he had con|&s;ulted &s;ome of the coole&s;t of his friends, who told him, they could &s;ee no rea&s;on why he &s;hould lo&s;e all the advantage of the time and labour, which it co&s;t him and the company to prepare this play, becau&s;e about twenty per&s;ons in a for|mer audience had &s;tamped the name of a party play on it; that he received many me&s;&s;ages that the play was de&s;ired, and unle&s;s performed would be in&s;i&s;ted on;" this proves that each party look|ed on it in that light.</P>
<P>A month however elap&s;ed before a repetition of this fatal piece took place; all was quiet in the town and theatre, and in all probability the former exhibition entirely forgot; happy would it have been if he had not revived it in their me|mory. On the 2d of March it was again an|nounced, and on the Friday morning before, he &s;ent a general &s;ummons to the company to meet him in the green-room, where, being all a&s;&s;em|bled, he read the following lecture, which as it does him infinite credit, and will be&s;t demon|&s;trate the purity of his intention, I think well worthy a place in this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="265">"I am &s;orry to find that party has become &s;o univer&s;al in Dublin, as to make its appearance vi&s;ibly on the &s;tage; I am &s;ure that is a mo&s;t im|proper place for it, on which account I think it my duty to lay before you the rule by which you ought to act at this juncture. I do not pretend to dictate to you in your private capacities, eve|ry man born under our happy con&s;titution has a right to think as he plea&s;es, and &s;peak his &s;enti|ments, provided they are not repugnant to the laws of the land, and the rules of civil &s;ociety. In your theatrical character I have an undoubted right at lea&s;t to advi&s;e you. I lay it down as a maxim, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of an actor is to dive&s;t him&s;elf, as much as po&s;&s;ible, of his private &s;en|timents, and to enter, with all the &s;pirit he is ma&s;ter of, into the character he repre&s;ents; and this is an indi&s;putable claim which the public in general have upon him. But if an actor in order to plea&s;e part of that public, &s;hould, by any unu&s;ual empha&s;is, ge&s;ture or &s;ignificant look, mark out a pa&s;&s;age in his part (which at another juncture he would have pa&s;&s;ed by lightly) as a party &s;troke, he, in that in&s;tance, &s;teps out of his feigned character into his natural one, than which nothing can be more di&s;gu&s;ting or in&s;olent to any auditor, who came with no other intent but that
<PB N="233" REF="266">
of &s;eeing the play; &s;uch a performer ought to be looked upon by the public as an incendiary, as one who throws the brand of di&s;cord among&s;t them; for &s;uppo&s;ing per&s;ons of a different way of thinking &s;hould take it into their head to re&s;ent and oppo&s;e this behaviour, the theatre in that ca&s;e, in&s;tead of being a place of plea&s;ure and en|tertainment, would become a &s;cene of riot and di&s;or|der. I was in hopes that the example I had &s;et upon this occa&s;ion, would have had &s;o much influence as to make admonitions unnece&s;&s;ary; for what|ever my private &s;entiments may have been, I defy any per&s;on to charge me ju&s;tly, that the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of them appeared in my conduct, either as a manager or an actor. I under&s;tand my duty to the public too well; it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to take all the precautions and care in my power, that the audience &s;hall enjoy their entertainment in peace, and not by any act of mine, to encou|rage and foment party feuds. Indeed I laid it down as a fixed re&s;olution to ob&s;erve in my pub|lic conduct a &s;trict neutrality; I determined to exhibit plays in the &s;ame order which I &s;hould have done had the town been entirely free from party; and as on the one hand I would lay no old play a&s;ide, le&s;t it might appear an application to the times, &s;o on the other I would revive none
<PB N="234" REF="267">
purely to &s;erve that end; for though I knew ma|ny plays, that, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the people, would have filled my hou&s;e many nights, and con&s;equently my pur&s;e, yet I &s;hould have looked upon my&s;elf in &s;o doing as a time-&s;erving, a pro&s;titutor of the &s;tage, and a betrayer of the public.</P>
<P>"Though it mu&s;t be allowed, that the rule I had laid down for my conduct, was the fitte&s;t to be ob&s;erved by the manager of a free &s;tage, yet I was far from e&s;caping cen&s;ure. Per&s;ons of both parties have often took offence at pa&s;&s;ages which they them&s;elves applied, and conclu&s;ions were drawn, that the play was played on purpo&s;e, &amp;c. and indeed this was unavoidable, for plays in ge|neral being pictures of life, and tragedies mo&s;tly of high life, and of per&s;ons concerned in &s;tate affairs, it was not po&s;&s;ible but that many inci|dents, characters and &s;entiments might bear ap|plication from minds bia&s;&s;ed by party. This is more particularly the ca&s;e with our Engli&s;h plays, who&s;e authors have cho&s;en more &s;ubjects, and written more freely upon government, than any other nation under the &s;un. You all know that the parts of the play of Mahomet were delivered out, and the repre&s;entation of it intended la&s;t
<PB N="235" REF="268">
year; but before it could be got ready the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced, that it was thought not prudent to hazard the performance of a new play to thin audiences.</P>
<P>"The nece&s;&s;ary amputations practi&s;ed on eve|ry play, were performed at different times on this at rehear&s;als, according as the &s;cenes were found tedious in repeating, and many of them were done at the reque&s;t of the actors con|cerned in the &s;cenes. I do not remember that any performer during the &s;everal readings and rehear&s;als took notice of any pa&s;&s;age that might be applicable, or any &s;entiment that might be termed a party one; and yet they are generally as &s;agacious in finding out &s;uch things as mo&s;t people; indeed in point of &s;tory, characters, in|cidents, and moral, I con&s;ider it as one of the mo&s;t unexceptionable plays that could be per|formed. And after having &s;everal times looked it over again with the utmo&s;t attention, I own my&s;elf &s;tupid enough to be &s;till of the &s;ame way of thinking; nor can I &s;ee how the tragedy it&s;elf, or any part of it, can be applied to the pre&s;ent times, without great &s;training of the &s;en&s;e and words. However as &s;ome per&s;ons judged other|wi&s;e, I thought proper to lay it by awhile, that
<PB N="236" REF="269">
people might have time to read and examine it coolly; if that be done, I make no doubt but all prejudices will be effaced. I have therefore ven|tured to give it once more to the public, directly as it was performed before, without diminution, alteration, or addition of a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>"As it was at the repre&s;entation of this play, that an innovation was attempted, and given way to, never known before in the theatre, I think it my duty to lay before you my &s;enti|ments upon the dangerous con&s;equences which may attend it to the &s;tage in general, and to all actors in particular. I mean a right claimed by the audience, to encore &s;peeches in plays.</P>
<P>"If it be once e&s;tabli&s;hed as a rule, that one part of an audience have a right to encore a &s;peech, upon the fame principle, any other part of that audience may claim the &s;ame right.</P>
<P>"If they have a right to have it once repeated, why not &s;everal times as well as once? Why not any other &s;peech as well as that one? And why not as many &s;peeches as they &s;hall think proper?</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="270">"If one party &s;hould encore a &s;peech, becau&s;e they think it makes for their purpo&s;e, may not another party encore as many as they think will make for them? Nay, may they not from a mere &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition encore every &s;peech, as often as they &s;hall think proper? In this ca&s;e, I do not &s;ee how we &s;hould be able to get through one act of a play.</P>
<P>"If one part of an audience &s;hould cry out Encore, have not the re&s;t an undoubted right to cry out, No more, as the fir&s;t claim is neither founded on rea&s;on or cu&s;tom? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, is not an actor certain of di&s;obliging one party or other? And is he not liable to the re&s;entment and ill treatment of one or the other?</P>
<P>"In &s;uch a &s;ituation the actors would be in a much wor&s;e condition than the mu&s;icians for|merly were. We all know the dreadful u&s;age they met with, in con&s;equence of a claim of that nature from the galleries. They a&s;&s;umed a right of calling for what tunes they plea&s;ed, but not always agreeing upon the tune, one party roared out for one, and the other was as clamor|ous for another; as the mu&s;icians could not po&s;|&s;ibly play both together, they thought that play|ing
<PB N="238" REF="271">
them one after another would &s;atisfy all par|ties, but that would not do. If they played the one, the advocates for the other thought they had a right to precedence, and &s;aluted them with a volley of apples and oranges. At la&s;t the out|rage ro&s;e to &s;uch an height, that they threw gla&s;s bottles and &s;tones, cut &s;everal of the per|formers, and broke their in&s;truments. Then there was no re&s;ource found, but that of order|ing the band never to go into the box, but to play behind the &s;cenes, at lea&s;t till the pit was &s;o full that they might be protected. This expedi|ent being often put in practice, put an end to the claim, and the band afterwards performed &s;uch pieces as were allotted to them without in|terruption. But the actors could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;uch an a&s;ylum; they cannot play their parts behind the &s;cenes, their duty obliges them to a po&s;t open to the battery of an incen&s;ed mul|titude, &s;ome of whom would &s;hower their re|&s;entment on them through malevolence or per|&s;onal pique, others through mere wantonne&s;s. Nor is this an imaginary or unlikely thing; eve|ry one who remembers the &s;tate of the &s;tage be|fore it was re&s;cued from &s;lavery, mu&s;t know that the thing often happened, merely through pri|vate re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="272">"In &s;hort, if this new claim is to be forced down our throats, I do not &s;ee where the matter will end. I know not why new claims may not be made every night; I know not why they may not in&s;i&s;t upon performers doing whatever they plea&s;e; in that ca&s;e, I know no human being in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate of &s;lavery as an actor would be.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, this is a blow &s;truck at the very vitals of the &s;tage, calculated to de&s;troy all ta&s;te in the audience, and &s;pirit in the performers; to breed perpetual feuds and divi&s;ions among&s;t the &s;pectators, and entail perpetual &s;lavery upon the actors. I hope you have all too great a &s;en&s;e of li|berty, and have the good of the &s;ociety too much at heart, to encourage &s;o fatal an encroachment upon your rights; and in that hope I &s;hall leave you entirely free, to act as you think proper, wi&s;hing that your conduct may rather be the re|&s;ult of a manly &s;en&s;e of freedom, than obedience to an order. In all new ca&s;es, indeed, I would rather per&s;uade than direct, convince than com|mand.</P>
<P>"To you, Mr. Digges, I mu&s;t particularly apply, as you were the fir&s;t tragedian I ever

heard of, who repeated a &s;peech upon the encore of an audience. I am in hopes it was the &s;ud|denne&s;s of the thing, and want of time to reflect upon the ill con&s;equences which might attend it. Yon have now heard my arguments upon that head; if you think they are of weight, I &s;uppo&s;e you will act accordingly; if not, remember I do not give you any orders upon this occa&s;ion, you are left entirely free to act as you plea&s;e."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Digges a&s;ks the Manager how to conduct him&s;elf.&mdash;His An&s;wer.&mdash;Speech encored.&mdash;Mr. Digges declines repeating it.&mdash;Mr. Sheridan called upon by the Audience.&mdash;Refu&s;es to appear.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN the manager had fini&s;hed this excel|lent lecture, the ju&s;tice of which every one al|lowed, Mr. Digges ro&s;e up, and ob&s;erved, that as the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e on the duties of an ac|tor was entirely levelled at him, and as the play was to be performed the night following, when
<PB N="242" REF="275">
in all probability the &s;ame demand would be again made on him, critically &s;ituated as he was, he de&s;ired to know from the manager how he &s;hould conduct him&s;elf? To this Mr. Sheridan replied, he would give him no directions, but leave him to do as he thought proper. Mr. Digges then &s;aid, "Sir, if I &s;hould comply with the demand of the audience, and repeat the &s;peech, am I to incur your cen&s;ure?" The manager replied, <HI>"Not at all; I leave you to act in that matter as you think proper."</HI></P>
<P>The next evening gave the deci&s;ive blow: &s;carce were the doors open before all parts of the theatre were crowded; but as the pit on &s;uch occa&s;ions is generally the principal &s;cene of ac|tion, &s;o here the enemy &s;eemed to have collect|ed their greate&s;t force. No &s;ooner did Alcanor make his appearance, than he was welcomed with uncommon tokens of applau&s;e, and &s;carce was this memorable &s;peech delivered, before a general demand of Encore! Encore! i&s;&s;ued from every part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Digges, who, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, was pre|pared for this attack, &s;eemed for &s;ome moments to be confounded; but the violence of the en|core
<PB N="243" REF="276">
&s;till continuing with unabated fury, he &s;tepped forward and made a motion to be heard; when &s;ilence was obtained, he &s;aid, "It would give him the highe&s;t plea&s;ure imaginable to com|ply with the reque&s;t of the audience, but he had his <HI>private rea&s;ons</HI> for begging they would be &s;o good as to excu&s;e him, <HI>as his compliance would be greatly injurious to him."</HI></P>
<P>Such an apology might naturally be expected, would rather inflame than appea&s;e a multitude already ripe for mi&s;chief, who only wanted a pretence to wreak their vengeance on the devot|ed object; accordingly the cry of Manager! Manager! Sheridan! Sheridan! was echoed through the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that on the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ions in life, when mo&s;t we need it, our pre&s;ence of mind for&s;akes us. It might tru|ly be &s;aid &s;o of Mr. Sheridan at this critical mo|ment; in all probability, if he had immediately come forward, and obeyed their &s;ummons, the uproar would have cea&s;ed, and the mi&s;chief been avoided. He naturally would have re|que&s;ted to know their plea&s;ure; in an&s;wer to which they certainly would have a&s;ked, if it was
<PB N="244" REF="277">
by his orders Mr. Digges forbore to gratify their demand. To this, with the greate&s;t truth, he could have replied, no; on the contrary, he knows I left him entirely at liberty <HI>to follow his own inclinations.</HI> Unrea&s;onable as they were, and I will &s;uppo&s;e them unrea&s;onable enough at that time, yet &s;uch a declaration mu&s;t have &s;i|lenced them, or turned their vengeance on its proper object, the actor, who&s;e imprudence continued all this di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Mr. Sheridan acted the direct contrary. On the clamour continuing he order|ed the curtain down, and &s;ent the Prompter on to acquaint the audience, that they were ready to perform the play, if it was &s;uffered to go on in quiet, if not they were at liberty to take their money again: this me&s;&s;age, as might be expected, was not heard, and the Prompter obliged immediately to withdraw.</P>
<P>Still there was a moment left which, if pro|perly improved, might have prevented the im|pending de&s;truction. But it was not to be&punc; Mr. Sheridan on finding they per&s;i&s;ted in calling for him, with &s;ome agitation &s;aid, <HI>"They have
<PB N="245" REF="278">
no right to call upon me&mdash;I'll not obey their call</HI>; I'll go up to my room and undre&s;s my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Some of his friends, Mr. Adderley in particu|lar, left the boxes and followed him to his dre&s;|&s;ing room, and advi&s;ed him not to undre&s;s, but to go down and pacify the audience: Mr. Adder|ly even offered to undertake, that the gentlemen of the pit &s;hould not offer any in&s;ult to him, of which he &s;eemed &s;o apprehen&s;ive. Mr. Sheri|dan replied, he had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions from the gentlemen of the pit, but his fears were of the behaviour of the galleries: That he was &s;orry to &s;ay, the hour was now arrived, <HI>when he could no longer &s;upport the &s;tage upon a footing which the world had approved of for many years,</HI> therefore he was determined to withdraw: that he &s;hould take another opportunity of convinc|ing him, that he was now drove to the fatal ne|ce&s;&s;ity before-mentioned; but he was under too much perturbation of mind at pre&s;ent, to be able to do it as clearly as he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Adderley finding his mediation could be of no &s;ervice, in&s;tead of returning to the pit went directly home, and Mr. Sheridan being undre&s;&s;ed, got into a chair, and was carried to
<PB N="246" REF="279">
his own hou&s;e in Dor&s;et-&s;treet. The uproar &s;till continuing, Mrs. Woffington was at length per|&s;uaded to try the force of her eloquence in a&s;&s;uag|ing the fury of this many-headed mon&s;ter; but this was as impolitic a &s;tep as could be taken, her known connexions with the court party pre|cluded all chance of her &s;ucce&s;s; as great a favou|rite as &s;he was on every other occa&s;ion, here her influence was entirely lo&s;t, and beauty, for once, failed in commanding re&s;pect and admiration.</P>
<P>As their la&s;t re&s;ource, Mr. Digges was pre|vailed upon to go forward; he did &s;o; &s;ilence and attention immediately &s;ucceeded; he can|didly informed the audience, that Mr. Sheridan had laid him under no injunction not to repeat the &s;peech, and therefore &s;hould not, on that ac|count have incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure. Had this declaration been made at fir&s;t, in all probability it would have prevented every mi&s;chief which en&s;ued; but it was now too late, and this was only looked upon as a pretence to mitigate their re&s;entment. The &s;torm was rai&s;ed, and they in&s;i&s;ted upon Mr. Sheridan's appearing, and an|&s;wering for him&s;elf. On being informed that he was gone home, they in&s;i&s;ted on his being &s;ent for, and added, that they would patiently wait an
<PB N="247" REF="280">
hour, as he was known to live at &s;ome di&s;tance; accordingly they &s;at quietly down to amu&s;e them|&s;elves till the time elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;engers were immediately di&s;patched to the manager, to acquaint him with the &s;ituation of affairs, and the re&s;olution of the hou&s;e; but un|happily no arguments could prevail on him to return back. This infatuation, for &s;uch it mu&s;t be called, when his all was at &s;take, was really a&s;toni&s;hing. When the hour was expired, they renewed their call, and after continuing it &s;ome|time, and no manager appearing, they proceeded very methodically to bu&s;ine&s;s. Two of their leaders, per&s;ons of gravity and condition, ro&s;e up in the middle of the pit, went over to the boxes, and handed out the ladies with a great deal of politene&s;s; this accompli&s;hed, a young gentleman &s;tood up in the middle of the pit, and cried out, <HI>"God ble&s;s his Maje&s;ty King George, with three huzzas!"</HI> At the end of the la&s;t huzza they fell to work with &s;uch fury, that in le&s;s than ten minutes the audience part was en|tirely demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Had their vengeance cea&s;ed here, the damage might have ea&s;ily been repaired; but not content with
<PB N="248" REF="281">
the mi&s;chief they had already committed, their rage knew no bounds; drawing their &s;words they leaped upon the &s;tage, and launched into every exce&s;s which the mo&s;t &s;avage brutality could urge them to; and a theatre, which, a few hours before, might have reflected honour on the mo&s;t civilized nation, was in a few mo|ments left an unexampled monument of barbarity.</P>
<P>After de&s;troying every &s;cene within their reach, they proceeded to the wardrobe, which they found too well defended; then, as the la&s;t effort of their revenge, they tore out the grate of the box-room, and dragged it into the middle of the room, in hopes, as it was full of burning coals, that it would &s;et fire to the hou&s;e altoge|ther; in this they were likewi&s;e prevented, as after their departure in triumph, it was removed to its original &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It can &s;carcely be credited that in &s;o capital a city as Dublin, &s;uch horid outrages &s;hould con|tinue &s;o many hours without the intervention of the civil magi&s;trate; but the unfortunate mana|ger &s;eemed marked for de&s;truction. The lord mayor was ill of the gout, the &s;heriffs were not to be found, and it was pa&s;t one o'clock in the
<PB N="249" REF="282">
morning before any per&s;on above a deputy con|&s;table could be procured, and long before that time the mi&s;chief had cea&s;ed, and revenge had glutted her fierce&s;t feelings.</P>
<P>Here let us pau&s;e, and, with an eye of pity, look back upon the dreadful &s;cene of havock and de&s;truction, which, in an unlucky hour, bla&s;t|ed the fair hopes of &s;o many years. Ill-fated manager! hard was your lot to direct the dra|matic &s;tate in &s;uch perilous times. Party rage and malice have long &s;ince, thank heaven, ex|hau&s;ted their envenomed &s;hafts&mdash;But who &s;hall repair your wrongs? The great &s;cheme of your life is defeated by one blow, and the fruits of eight years indefatigable pains, bla&s;ted in one night. You awake from a dream, and find that the be&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous of your years have been employed to no purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>This cruel treatment immediately determined Mr. Sheridan to give up all ideas of manage|ment. He advertized his theatres to be let or &s;old; and took leave of the public in a very pa|thetic and affecting addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="283">As 'tis is the mid&s;t of misfortunes that the truly great mind &s;hines in its native lu&s;tre, &s;o never did Mr. Sheridan's conduct appear in &s;uch noble colours as at this intere&s;ting period. Though u&s;ed with &s;uch unparalleled cruelty, and his fortunes ruined pa&s;t all hopes of retrieving, yet feeling for the performers under his care, who innocently were involved in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he re&s;olved they &s;hould not partake, and with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which will ever add honour to his character, generou&s;ly gave them up the u&s;e of his theatre, or what remained of it, with the wardrobe and &s;cenery, for their benefits during the re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on, <HI>not only without any emolu|ment, but at a certain lo&s;s each night to him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly the theatre, after undergoing a few temporary repairs, opened again March 18th, 1754, about a fortnight after the riot, by com|mand of the duke and duche&s;s of Dor&s;et, for Mrs. Woffington's benefit, with the tragedy of All for Love, to a very crowded audience; after which the benefits, mo&s;t of which were good, continued without intermi&s;&s;ion, till the middle of May, when the theatre clo&s;ed, and Mrs. Wof|fington returned to London.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE theatres, after being adverti&s;ed for &s;ome months, were at length taken by Mr. Sowdon and Mr. Victor. The&s;e gentlemen had &s;ome proper|ty, and were tolerably well qualified for &s;uch an undertaking. They agreed with Mr. Sheridan for two years certain, paying him five pounds for every acting night, and advancing him two thou&s;and pounds, on a mortgage of the theatres. This bu&s;ine&s;s concluded, Mr. Victor &s;et about repairing the damages which Smock-alley theatre had &s;u&s;tained, and Mr. Sowdon &s;et off for Lon|don to recruit.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="285">In this expedition he was extremely &s;ucce&s;sful, and returned with a great deal of novelty. The principal object of his pur&s;uit was Mr. Barry: as at this dangerous and critical juncture no per&s;on &s;eemed &s;o proper to &s;upport the new govern|ment, and &s;upply the lo&s;s of &s;o great a favourite as the late manager. Mr. Barry was fully &s;en&s;i|ble of his own importance, and in&s;i&s;ted upon eight hundred pounds &s;alary for him&s;elf, and five hundred pounds for Mi&s;s No&s;&s;iter, a young lady then under his protection. The&s;e were great terms, but nece&s;&s;ity obliged the managers to comply with them.</P>
<P>However they made a more moderate agree|ment with Mrs. Gregory, afterwards Mrs. Fitz|henry. This lady was then but young on the &s;tage, having played but one winter at Covent-Garden: &s;he was engaged for three hundred pounds, and proved a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition. Luckily for the managers, in their covenant with Mr. Barry, they &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould be obliged to perform &s;ixty nights in the &s;ea&s;on, &s;o that the eight hundred pounds divided into &s;ixty parts was about fourteen pounds per night, by which means, though he was remarkably a&s;&s;idu|ous, yet at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;on nine of
<PB N="253" REF="286">
the nights were wanting to complete the &s;ixty, and con&s;equently a great &s;aving to the new ma|nagers.</P>
<P>Every thing being prepared, Smock-alley thea|tre opened, under the au&s;pices of Me&s;&s;rs. Sow|don and Victor, October 7th, 1754, with the comedy of The Su&s;picious Hu&s;band. Ranger, by Mr. King; Frankly, Mr. Dexter; Bellamy, Mr. Heaphy; Strickland, Mr. Sowdon; Mrs. Strickland, Mi&s;s Danvers; Jacintha, Mrs. Cow|per (from Drury-lane); and Clarinda, Mi&s;s Ken|nedy (from Covent-garden). The play went off extremely well, and the audience &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed. For though every moderate per&s;on la|mented the &s;evere fate of Mr. Sheridan, and de|plored the &s;ituation he was reduced to, yet as the injury was irreparable, they thought it much more prudent to remain quiet at pre&s;ent, than by an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to revive the &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition, the abetters of which, a&s;hamed of their late unju&s;tifiable proceedings, were on this occa|&s;ion the mo&s;t forward in &s;upporting the theatre.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the reinforcement above-mentioned, Mr. Lacy, from Drury-lane, paid Ireland a &s;e|cond vi&s;it, and opened in King Lear; and Mr.
<PB N="254" REF="287">
Love, a very good comedian, from the &s;ame theatre, made his fir&s;t appearance in Sir John Fal&s;taff, in which he &s;ucceeded remarkably well, and during the remainder of the &s;ea&s;on, he play|ed a variety of characters in comedy with much reputation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gregory was brought forward in Her|mione, in The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother, a character &s;he &s;u&s;tained with an uncommon degree of merit, and on her fir&s;t night received that ju&s;t tribute of approbation, which con&s;tantly attended her performance. The fir&s;t time Mr. Barry was an|nounced he drew a very brilliant and crowded audience: he appeared in his favourite Othello, and was received with that warmth of applau&s;e which his uncommon merit &s;o highly intitled him to. In the cour&s;e of this work I &s;hall en|deavour to throw together a few remarks on the various excellencies of this great actor; at pre|&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that every one notic|ed with plea&s;ure how much he had improved during his ab&s;ence, and congratulated the ma|nagers on their judicious choice of the only per|&s;on capable of &s;u&s;taining the Iri&s;h &s;tage in its pre&s;ent predicament.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="288">Mi&s;s No&s;&s;iter clo&s;ed the li&s;t of capital per|formers. The fir&s;t of December &s;he played Ju|liet, with Mr. Barry's Romeo, and Mr. King's Mercutio, in which, making every allowance for a young actre&s;s, &s;he gave evident proofs of genius and ability.</P>
<P>With this company the town &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied. Mr. Barry generally drew crowd|ed hou&s;es. As the reader perhaps may be curi|ous to know the receipts of the theatre at this pe|riod, it luckily happens that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the amount of twenty-&s;ix of Mr. Barry's nights, which, for his &s;atisfaction, I &s;hall here pre&s;ent, only premi&s;ing, that when they com|menced Mr. Barry's novelty was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure abated.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="290">I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve on the above, that tho&s;e were e&s;teemed good hou&s;es, and &s;ufficient to enable the managers to make good their engage|ments of &s;ixteen hundred pounds for the &s;ea&s;on to three capital performers: Mr. Barry, then de|&s;ervedly at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion, Mi&s;s No&s;|&s;iter, and Mrs. Gregory, exclu&s;ive of the other actors and actre&s;&s;es. When in proper time tho&s;e receipts are compared with the extraordinary &s;ums which Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Crawford, and others have drawn at different times, the public perhaps will be &s;urprized to find how much Dub|lin has increa&s;ed in population and wealth, and improved in ta&s;te for theatrical performances &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>But to return. Though the &s;pirit of party had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, yet &s;till the re|mains of it rankled in the brea&s;ts of a few. Its fir&s;t appearance was in a demand of the revival of the fatal play of Mahomet. The managers, apprehen&s;ive of &s;erious con&s;equences, for &s;ome evaded the demand, but fearing to incen&s;e the multitude, the play was at length promi&s;ed.

<P>A&s;hamed of their defeat, the leaders of oppo|&s;ition laid the whole mi&s;carriage of their de&s;igns on the manner in which the parts were perform|ed, not having the names of Barry or Mrs. Gre|gory to &s;upport them; and, as their la&s;t effort, reque&s;ted it might be given out once more: this was complied with, when, to their utter morti|fication, &s;o few came to the hou&s;e that it was obliged to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Thus ended an affair which in the beginning, had been productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief; and &s;uch a difference does even a very few years often make in the minds and actions of an audience.</P>
<P>This &s;ea&s;on clo&s;ed the 9th of June, much to the manager's &s;atisfaction. Mr. Barry and Mi&s;s No&s;&s;iter returned to London, and Mr. Sowdon was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying their places to the be&s;t advantage. And here I &s;hall conclude

Though they had luckily &s;aved them&s;elves under the heavy engagements of the la&s;t winter, yet were they unwilling to run &s;uch another hazard&punc; therefore, in order to avoid the ri&s;que of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng &s;o large a &s;um to any capital performer, they agreed with Mr. Mo&s;&s;op that he &s;hould have a third of the profits. The nightly expence was e&s;timated at forty pounds, after which the overplus was to be divided be|tween Mr. Victor, Mr. Sowdon and Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="296">This was a prudent precaution; but they omitted a mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, which was, the obliging him to perform a certain num|ber of nights; &s;o that though Mr. Mo&s;&s;op really drew a great deal of money, yet as he found that playing once a week would certainly excite curio&s;ity, more than if he acted three or four times, &s;o he naturally availed him&s;elf of it, and through the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on performed only twenty-four nights; the con&s;equences of which were, that as Mrs. Gregory, who&s;e &s;alary was mo&s;t de&s;ervedly advanced to four hundred pounds, was only &s;tudied in a few of Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op's tragedies, and &s;eldom appeared in comedy, the managers, at the clo&s;e of the engagements, found them&s;elves out of po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> whil&s;t Mr M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+&s;op's emoluments, benefits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> very great, amounted to between eight and nine hundred pounds.</P>
<P>However, be&s;ides t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;trength of Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op and Mrs. Gregory, the managers had not been remi&s;s in providing a great deal of no|velty. A number of new performers and pieces were brought forward in the cour&s;e of the win|ter. Mr. Stamper, a comedian of much me|rit, appeared in the character of the Mi&s;er,
<PB N="264" REF="297">
which he &s;upported with great ju&s;tice and na|ture; his Scrub, Fore&s;ight, and many parts in that line of bu&s;ine&s;s were well received by the public, and he was con&s;idered as a real acqui&s;i|tion to the drama. A young gentleman of the name of Kirkpatrick played Romeo, and after|wards Altamont, E&s;&s;ex, &amp;c. with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s; and Mrs. Glen, from Covent-garden, was an|nounced to the town in Juliet.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t material advantage the mana|gers reaped at this time, was the reinforcement of a &s;trong mu&s;ical party. Dr. Arne having then under his direction a very excellent company of vocal performers, engaged for the repre&s;entation of three operas, Eliza, Alfred, and the Fairies, by a &s;ub&s;cription for ten nights each. This was a great relief to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre; the&s;e operas filled up the vacant nights, at the &s;ame time that they an&s;wered Dr. Arne's purpo&s;e, as he obtained a large &s;ub&s;crip|tion, they being patronized by the Lord Lieutenant, the Marquis of Hartington, after|wards Duke of Devon&s;hire, and by mo&s;t of the nobility.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="298">The&s;e operas were in general well &s;upported by Mr. Sadler, Mrs. Arne, the celebrated Mi&s;s Brent, who, though very young at that time, gave every a&s;&s;urance of her future fame, and a Mi&s;s Polly Young, a child po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an un|common fine voice and manner. At the clo&s;e of this very &s;ea&s;on Mi&s;s Brent &s;tudied and play|ed for the fir&s;t time, the part of Polly in the Beg|gars Opera, a character in which &s;he drew &s;uch extraordinary hou&s;es in London, a few years after.</P>
<P>In this place, I mu&s;t once for all beg leave to ob&s;erve, that as it was my earne&s;t wi&s;h through the whole of this performance, to exhibit to the public a faithful portrait of the Iri&s;h &s;tage, in all its various vici&s;&s;itudes and changes, and to pre|&s;ent every information which I could collect on the &s;ubject, &s;o I deemed it e&s;&s;ential to mention the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of performers of any emi|nence, who from time to time have appeared on the Dublin theatre; that however defective in other re&s;pects this work might be, yet, upon examination, it would be found a faithful dra|matic chronicle. This, I hope, will in part ex|cu&s;e its many imperfections, and apologize for the otherwi&s;e unintere&s;ting details of the fir&s;t
<PB N="266" REF="299">
appearances of &s;everal per&s;ons, who, but for this con&s;ideration, were not of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to interrupt the narrative.</P>
<P>But to return. As the managers principal re|liance were upon Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and Mrs. Gre|gory, great care was taken in bringing them properly forward. The pieces &s;elected to &s;hew the&s;e two performers to advantage were judi|ciou&s;ly cho&s;en; Mr. Mo&s;&s;op came out in his favourite Zanga, a character he was univer|&s;ally admired in, after which he played Richard, Pierre, Horatio, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The tragedy of Barbaro&s;&s;a, written by Dr. Browne, was brought out at Drury-lane in 1755, by Mr. Garrick, with great &s;ucce&s;s, and engaged the manager's attention. This play has cer|tainly &s;ome capital defects, among&s;t which may be reckoned an exce&s;s of action, and extravagance of pa&s;&s;ion approaching to bomba&s;t, yet is the plot founded on the &s;tronge&s;t of all human con|nexions, maternal and filial affections; and though no &s;ubject is more common, or has been oftener treated upon, yet it is always &s;ure to command our attention and intere&s;t our feelings.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="300">As the &s;ucce&s;s of this tragedy was an object worth the attention of the managers, they be|&s;towed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of pains in getting it up. It was performed, for the fir&s;t time, in Dublin, on February 2d, 1756, and was re|ceived with much applau&s;e. Mrs. Gregory's performance of Zaphira ju&s;tly acquired her great reputation; it was an original character, (a &s;in|gular advantage to any performer) which added much to her fame.</P>
<P>Though the part of Achmet was not in every re&s;pect &s;uited to the abilities of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, yet he threw &s;o much &s;pirit and force into it, and gave the whole &s;o high a colouring, that he re|ceived uncommon applau&s;e. The interview and di&s;covery in the third act between the mother and &s;on were finely &s;upported by Mrs. Gregory and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, and produced an admirable effect. The play was often repeated and brought crowded hou&s;es. Indeed it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that independent of the capital manner in which it was acted, it has a good deal of in|trin&s;ic merit, and will always keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage.&mdash;Coriolanus was at this time revived, in which Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and Mrs. Gregory ap|peared to great advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="301">Coriolanus has been, by the be&s;t judges of acting, always e&s;teemed one of Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's ma&s;ter-pieces. All the &s;tern fiercene&s;s of the proud, haughty, unrelenting Roman was admi|rably adapted to his powers. He often wanted variety but never force. His la&s;t act was un|commonly fine, and the remembrance of it will not readily be effaced from the memory of tho&s;e who were &s;o happy as to partake of that plea&s;ure. With equal judgment he &s;upported Shake&s;peare's Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure. His Duke was truly a capital piece of acting, in which he never was excelled. Nor mu&s;t we in ju&s;tice omit Mrs. Gregory's I&s;abella, which de&s;ervedly added much to her reputation.</P>
<P>Very little el&s;e worth noticing occurred the remainder of this &s;ea&s;on, except the mention of two pieces that were brought out by the well-known Henry Brooke, E&s;q. The fir&s;t was a revival of Jack the Giant Queller, which failed, and with difficulty reached the third night. The other was a tragedy called Injured Honour. This piece was founded on an old Engli&s;h &s;tory, at the time of the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the Danes. It was extremely well received, brought &s;everal
<PB N="269" REF="302">
good hou&s;es, and the author's night was ho|noured with the pre&s;ence of the lord lieutenant.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring following, Mr. Woodward, having obtained leave from the manager of Drury-lane theatre to perform in Dublin, imme|diately concluded an agreement with Mr. Sowdon for nine nights on &s;hares, and on the 17th of May he opened in Marplot and Captain Fla&s;h, in both of which he gave great &s;atis|faction. His other characters were Captain Bobadil in Every Man in his Humour, Scrub and the Apprentice, Atall in the Double Gal|lant, the Copper Captain and Petruchio. This trip proved mutually advantageous to both par|ties, and Mr. Woodward cleared upwards of two hundred pounds by the expedition.</P>
<P>This la&s;t effort clo&s;ed the management of Me&s;&s;rs. Victor and Sowdon. Though men of character and probity, and tolerably conver&s;ant in the bu&s;ine&s;s of directing a theatre, yet they found the weight too great to &s;upport, and they heartily wi&s;hed to extricate them&s;elves with credit and without lo&s;s.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE mi&s;ts of prejudice and party were now nearly di&s;&s;ipated, the calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate eye of rea&s;on beheld objects in their proper light, and the public looked upon Mr. Sheridan as a much injured man, to whom they were under infinite obligations, which could no other way be com|pen&s;ated than by re&s;toring him to the &s;tation he lately held with &s;o much honour. On his leaving Ireland he had entered into an agreement with Mr. Rich, of Covent-garden, for a &s;hare of the
<PB N="271" REF="304">
profits on &s;uch nights as he &s;hould perform the en&s;uing winter, when he played a variety of cha|racters with the greate&s;t reputation. He then quit the &s;tage, and was at this time bu&s;ily em|ployed in bringing to perfection a plan he had long at heart, of forming a &s;y&s;tem of education on a more liberal and exten&s;ive &s;cale than any hitherto &s;truck out, which, if carried into execu|tion, mu&s;t be productive of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences to his native kingdom.</P>
<P>All eyes being turned on Mr. Sheridan, the general voice of the nation &s;oon reached him; and as the <HI>amor patriae</HI> was ever the ruling prin|ciple in his brea&s;t, he willingly obeyed the wel|come invitation, and prepared to re-a&s;&s;ume the throne he was &s;o rudely forced to abdicate. Money was rai&s;ed to pay off the mortgage, and in a &s;hort time he was fully rein&s;tated in his do|minions. Mr. Victor was not of the opinion, that 'twas better to reign in hell than &s;erve in heaven; on the contrary, he cheerfully de&s;cended to his former &s;tation of deputy-manager and trea|&s;urer, both which offices he di&s;charged with credit; and Mr. Sowdon was likewi&s;e content, after wielding for two years the theatrical &s;ceptre, to fall into the ranks, where he was of real &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="305">At this juncture, with a &s;pirit worthy of a ma|nager who pre&s;ided over the dramatic entertain|ments of a kingdom, as &s;oon as Mr. Sheridan was a&s;&s;ured of returning, he called upon Mr. Barry in London, in company with a gentleman a common friend to both, and made him overtures of all kinds, to engage him the next &s;ea&s;on to bear a principal part in the theatre he was in|vited back to. At the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, that his chief bu&s;ine&s;s to Ireland was only to en|deavour to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;tage once more on a re&s;pectable footing; that he &s;hould not continue on it more than a year or two at mo&s;t, and in that ca&s;e, it &s;hould be Mr. Barry's own fault if his &s;tation there was not as eligible as he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry at fir&s;t did not &s;eem to reli&s;h the propo&s;al. He mentioned a de&s;ign which his friends had, of building a theatre for him. Mr. Sheridan then offered, either to engage him on a certain &s;alary, or if he liked it better, to admit him to a &s;hare of the profits for the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, and afterwards to let the theatre to him. Before they parted Mr. Barry &s;eemed inclined to come into &s;ome one of the propo&s;als, promi&s;ed to con&s;ider the matter, and in a few days to call
<PB N="273" REF="306">
upon Mr. Sheridan and let him know the re&s;ult of his determination. But he never called, nor ever afterwards wrote or &s;poke to Mr. Sheridan on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, he was obliged to return to Ireland, without accompli&s;hing an union which would have prevented the innumerable mi&s;chiefs produced a few years after by an oppo&s;ition. On his arrival he &s;et about the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;tage with alacrity. The theatre was much wrecked, and obliged to undergo a thorough repair. The &s;cenery was almo&s;t unfit for u&s;e; he therefore immediately &s;et Mr. Lewis, a good &s;cene-painter, to work, who in a few months completed three or four &s;ets of &s;cenes and wings. The wardrobe al&s;o received a con|&s;iderable addition, and matters &s;eemed to wear a promi&s;ing a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Nor was he remi&s;s in procuring the be&s;t en|tertainment for the public which the times would admit of. Unable to obtain Mr. Barry, he entered into an engagement with Mr. Lee, then an actor of reputation, whom he had never &s;een perform, for four hundred pounds for the &s;ea&s;on. Though he did not entirely an&s;wer the
<PB N="274" REF="307">
manager's expectations, yet he &s;upported a line of fir&s;t characters with tolerable reputation. But he concluded a much heavier and le&s;s profit|able contract with &s;ignior Marene&s;i and &s;ignora Bugiani, to whom he gave a thou&s;and pounds. Though they were then e&s;teemed the be&s;t dancers in Europe, yet certainly they could not be worth half that &s;um to him at that time.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help ob&s;erving, that through the whole of Mr. Sheridan's conducting the Iri&s;h &s;tage, it appears to me that his greate&s;t error was, his engaging to give larger &s;alaries to par|ticular performers than the theatre could then afford. And though the&s;e engagements were all punctually fulfilled, yet he left precedents which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have found very difficult to imitate. Be&s;ides the&s;e already mentioned, he produced a great deal of other novelty. Several performers of merit were brought out, among&s;t whom were two &s;i&s;ters, Mi&s;s G. and Mi&s;s M. Phillips, young ladies of a good family, who for many years afterwards were well received in a variety of characters, both in tragedy and comedy; Mr. Glover, an excellent comedian and a re&s;pectable character; Mi&s;s Wells, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="308">Every nece&s;&s;ary preparation being made, the theatre opened once more under Mr. Sheridan, October 18th, 1756, with the comedy of the Bu&s;y Body, Marplot by Mr. King, who at this time was a great favourite with the public. This gentleman &s;upported an exten&s;ive round of cha|racters, and that of a very motley complexion; as Ranger, the Mi&s;er, Abel Drugger, Duretete, Scrub, Lord Lace, Bayes, Tattle, O&s;tric, Fine Gentleman, Tom, Trinculo, &amp;c. with great and de&s;erved applau&s;e; and I am happy that my &s;ub|ject in this place furni&s;hes me with an opportu|nity of paying a ju&s;t tribute to the public worth and private virtues of one of the greate&s;t orna|ments which our &s;tage at pre&s;ent can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>It might naturally be expected, that the recol|lection of pa&s;t events would enhance the plea&s;ure of the pre&s;ent evening, and that nothing could po&s;&s;ibly happen to interrupt the harmony of the fir&s;t night's performance. But little dependence ought to be placed on the mo&s;t flattering appear|ances. At the opening of the &s;econd act a few young men in the pit called out Apology! Apology! which was &s;econded by the &s;ame number in both the galleries. Mr. Dexter, who performed Sir George Airey, and who was
<PB N="276" REF="309">
remarkable for his mode&s;t behaviour, being on the &s;tage at the time of this unexpected demand, was &s;o confu&s;ed, that unable to make any an&s;wer he bowed and retired to con&s;ult Mr. Victor, who happened to be behind the &s;cenes at that time. Mr. Victor de&s;ired him to go on again directly, and if the demand was repeated to ac|quaint the audience, that Mr. Sheridan was really ill of a cold which confined him to his apartment, and that he did not doubt but when be was recovered, he would give them every &s;atisfaction they de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But this would not by any means content them. They had collected &s;pirits enough to make a beginning, which gathered &s;trength by degrees. They in&s;i&s;ted upon Mr. Dexter's go|ing to him, as they knew his hou&s;e was adjoin|ing the theatre, and bringing them a po&s;itive promi&s;e from him. Finding them determined, Mr. Dexter came off again, and with Mr. Victor went to Mr. Sheridan, to whom they related the demand of the audience. He &s;eemed greatly di&s;turbed by the account Mr. Dexter gave him, but after &s;ome deliberation, alarmed at the recol|lection of pa&s;t &s;cenes, it was concluded that Mr. Dexter &s;hould return and a&s;&s;ure the audience
<PB N="277" REF="310">
that when Mr. Sheridan was recovered, he would make an apology on the &s;tage, and that public no|tice &s;hould be given of it in the bills and adverti&s;e|ments. Upon Mr. Dexter's delivering this de|claration he was received with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and the performance concluded without any further interruption.</P>
<P>Every mind &s;u&s;ceptible of the finer feelings of humanity, may readily conceive what pa&s;&s;ed in the bo&s;om of the manager on this occa&s;ion. How|ever, he &s;aw there was no contending with the &s;everity of his fate, therefore he nobly prepared to meet it with becoming fortitude. Too much affected to deliver this apology on a night in which he had a character to play, he adverti&s;ed it previous to the comedy of the Su&s;picious Hu&s;band, October the 25th 1756. The theatre was early crowded to behold the unmanly tri|umph of de&s;poti&s;m over rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. Such a &s;pectacle perhaps, was never pre&s;ented to the public before or &s;ince. A manager who de|&s;erved a &s;tatue rai&s;ed to perpetuate the memory of the good he had done, obliged to appear like a criminal before that tribunal which he had &s;o often furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t noble and rational entertainment! But he was equal to this arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="311">When the curtain drew up he advanced to the front of the &s;tage, with a paper in his hand, fearing in the confu&s;ion which mu&s;t unavoidably attend him, to tru&s;t entirely to his memory. It was the univer&s;al opinion of the be&s;t judges who were &s;pectators of this trying moment, that no man within their ob&s;ervation ever appeared before the public with more propriety. Tears gu&s;hed from the eyes of &s;everal of his male auditors. As &s;oon as his &s;peech, which was mode&s;t, ex|pre&s;&s;ive and conci&s;e, was concluded, the loude&s;t acclamations &s;ucceeded. So powerful is truth, that not a heart but participated his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Reiterated plaudits &s;poke their &s;en&s;ations which continuing as he was retiring, he advanced again, and with broken faultring accents &s;poke as follows, <HI>"Your goodne&s;s to me at this impor|tant cri&s;is, has &s;o deeply affected me, that I want powers to expre&s;s my&s;elf; my future actions &s;hall. &s;hew my gratitude."</HI></P>
<P>If ever there was a moment peculiarly marked with di&s;grace to the feelings of a Dublin audi|ence, it was on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; and po&s;te|rity who read the page mu&s;t blu&s;h at the dege|neracy of the times, which could reduce a man of Mr. Sheridan's abilities and &s;entiments to the
<PB N="279" REF="312">
humiliating &s;ituation of apologizing to the de|&s;troyers of his property, for their ruining his fortune and demoli&s;hing the labours of &s;o many years! But I mu&s;t quit the ungrateful &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A few nights after, Mr. Sheridan appeared in the character of Hamlet, and was received by a very brilliant audience with that warmth of ap|plau&s;e which a &s;en&s;e of his injuries in&s;pired. He afterwards drew &s;everal good hou&s;es to his Richard, Tamerlane, Shore, Horatio, &amp;c. Mr. Lee's fir&s;t appearance was in Lear; he then per|formed Ha&s;tings, Iago, Hot&s;pur, &amp;c. In the Fair Penitent we find Horatio, Mr. Sheridan; Lothario, Mr. Lee; Sciolto, Mr. Heaphy; Altamont, Mr. Dexter; Lavinia, Mi&s;s Grace Phillips, and Cali&s;ta, Mi&s;s M. Phillips; and in the Con&s;cious Lovers, Bevil jun. Mr. Sheridan; Myrtle, Mr. Lee; Tom, Mr. King; Cimberton, Mr. Glover; Sealand, Mr. Heaphy; Phillis, Mi&s;s Grace Phillips, and Indiana, Mi&s;s Phillips.</P>
<P>But this part of the &s;ea&s;on is to be particularly noticed for introducing to the knowledge of the public Mr. James Wilder, a good comedian, a mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizen, and, to &s;um up all, a worthy hone&s;t man. Mr. and Mrs. Wilder arrived in Dublin from Drury-lane theatre early
<PB N="280" REF="313">
in the winter, and made their fir&s;t appearance at Smock-alley, on Saturday December 17th 1756, in the parts of Macheath and Polly in the Beggars Opera; in which they acquitted them&s;elves &s;o highly to the &s;atisfaction of the audience, that they brought the opera once more into fa&s;hion, and occa&s;ioned it to be performed once a week during the &s;ea&s;on, upwards of twenty nights, be&s;ides benefits, to crowded hou&s;es. In Captain Macheath, Mr. Wilder &s;ung a new &s;ong called a Cock and a Bull, which be|came &s;o great a favourite that it was regularly adverti&s;ed each time along with the opera. Their great &s;ucce&s;s in tho&s;e characters induced the manager to get up the elegant mu&s;ical entertain|ment of the Oracle. Mrs. Wilder was young, a good figure, and e&s;teemed excellent in the girls. Her Cynthia and Mr. Wilder's Oberon plea&s;ed much, and the piece was played a number of nights with &s;ingular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Tempe&s;t was revived much about this time with great care and expence. Mr. Sheri|dan's Pro&s;pero was excellent; Mr. King was capital in Trinculo; the re&s;t of the parts were well di&s;po&s;ed of, and the piece brought five or &s;ix good hou&s;es. Coriolanus and Barbaro&s;&s;a were al&s;o got up, but did not do much.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="314">Though there reigned &s;uch perfect harmony between the manager and the public, yet his ears were con&s;tantly dinned with the report of an oppo&s;ition. At fir&s;t he was unwilling to credit the rumour, but facts carried demon&s;tra|tion. The ground cho&s;en for this new &s;cene of action was the mu&s;ic-hall in Crow-&s;treet, which was to be demoli&s;hed, and a new theatre erected. Mr. Sheridan finding too much truth in the report, before affairs were too far ad|vanced, di&s;patched Mr. Victor to London, to treat with Mr. Barry the intended manager, and endeavour to di&s;&s;uade him from &s;o hazardous an undertaking, &s;ince he might have the united theatres, and as Mr. Victor &s;ays, "to ob&s;erve to him that inconte&s;table fact, that a monopoly in a great city, was of more worth to a manager than any other con&s;ideration whatever." Thus commi&s;&s;ioned Mr. Victor left Dublin in April, about the &s;ame time that Mr. Foote, who was engaged to give a &s;pirit to the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on, arrived.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote opened in Sir Charles Buck in his own comedy of The Engli&s;hman returned from Paris, and afterwards performed Bayes, Hartop in the Knights, Fondlewi&s;e in the Old Batche|lor,
<PB N="282" REF="315">
&amp;c. He drew money, and his trip turned out advantageou&s;ly to him&s;elf and the manager.</P>
<P>Much about this time the tragedy of Douglas made a great noi&s;e in the world. Mr. Garrick, who&s;e judgment was very &s;eldom called in que&s;|tion, mo&s;t unluckily per&s;evered in rejecting this play, though very powerful intere&s;t was made to bring it on. The greate&s;t men are &s;ometimes wrong; this certainly was his ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Few people could read &s;o affecting a &s;tory without emotion. The novelty of the manners, the &s;everal intere&s;ting &s;ituations, and the peculiar &s;trokes of nature in the &s;cenes be|tween Lady Randolph and her &s;on, mu&s;t make an impre&s;&s;ion on the mo&s;t obdurate bo&s;oms. Accordingly we find its &s;ucce&s;s was uncommon, and far beyond the run of modern tragedies.</P>
<P>Succe&s;sful as it was at other theatres, its power failed in Dublin at this time. It is true, nature had not formed Mr. Sheridan to per&s;onate the blooming Douglas, nor had he any lady at that time who could in any mea&s;ure do ju&s;tice to the exqui&s;ite feelings of Lady Randolph. In a few years after, Mr. Digges, and then Mr. Barry, an|&s;wered our utmo&s;t ideas of the blooming Norval;
<PB N="283" REF="316">
but it was re&s;erved for Mrs. Crawford in the &s;orrowful Matilda, to charm the public with one of the mo&s;t beautiful pieces of dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;s ever exhibited. If the reader would wi&s;h to know how the tragedy was at the pre&s;ent &s;upported, it was in this manner. Young Norval, Mr. She|ridan; Old Norval, Mr. Lee; Lord Randolph, Mr. Dexter; Glenalvon, Mr. Stayley; Anna, Mi&s;s Grace Phillips; and Lady Randolph, Mrs. Kennedy, who, though a good actre&s;s in comedy, had but few preten&s;ions to the bu&s;kin. It was performed but two nights, and then laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>I omitted mentioning in its proper place, that at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, among&s;t other regulations adopted by the manager, he determined if po&s;&s;ible to put an end to the num|berle&s;s complaints of the outrages committed by the frequenters of the upper gallery, by convert|ing it into boxes, and rai&s;ing the price to half a crown. This an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed, but proved highly detrimental to his intere&s;t. For as mo&s;t things are governed by fa&s;hion, &s;o novelty and whim drew the ladies, and con&s;e|quently the gentlemen in &s;uch numbers to the upper boxes, that tho&s;e below were in a great mea&s;ure de&s;erted, and the pit thinned of cour&s;e.
<PB N="284" REF="317">
However by this regulation peace and order were &s;uddenly re&s;tored, and the theatre once more became a place of quiet, as well as rational entertainment.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e this chapter, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers with the receipts of twenty-one of Mr. Sheridan's nights. They may convey an idea of the &s;ucce&s;s of the theatre, and contra&s;ted with tho&s;e of Mr. Barry's before-mentioned, will &s;hew what e&s;timation Mr. Sheridan was held in by the public.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LET us now turn our eyes to London, and enquire into the &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. Victor in his important negociation. At his fir&s;t interview with Mr. Barry, he informed him of Mr. She|ridan's propo&s;als, and mentioned on what advan|tageous
<PB N="287" REF="320">
terms he might become &s;ole manager of the united theatres of Smock-alley and Aungier-&s;treet, if he had any exceptions to a partner&s;hip with Mr. Sheridan, and by that means the hazard and expence of building a new theatre might be prevented. Unluckily for both parties, the&s;e offers were rejected. Mr. Barry declared, that he was too far advanced in engagements to recede, and that let what would be the con&s;e|quence, he was determined to per&s;evere. Indeed it appears through the whole, that he had long re&s;olved on it, as I formerly mentioned that Mr. Sheridan had applied to him before he could po&s;&s;ibly have made any advances, and &s;uch a project could only have exi&s;ted in his own idea.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in the principal de&s;ign of his journey, all Mr. Victor could do, was after a long train of tedious negociation to engage Mrs. Gregory and Mrs. Hamilton, the former at five hundred, and the latter at four hundred pounds for the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Colley Cibber in his apology &s;ays, "we nei|ther a&s;ked actors, nor were de&s;ired by them, to &s;ign any written agreement whatever. The
<PB N="288" REF="321">
rates of their re&s;pective &s;alaries were only entered in our daily pay roll, which plain record every one looked upon as good as city &s;ecurity." Such a line of conduct might have an&s;wered very well in the laureat's time, but had Mr. Cibber lived in tho&s;e days he would have found it nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;tronger ties than tho&s;e. However, Mrs. Gregory and Mr. Victor had &s;uch a mutual confidence in each other, that though he acted only as Mr. Sheridan's agent, yet Mrs. Gregory was content with a written memorandum, mentioning the &s;um &s;he was to have. With Mrs. Hamilton, who&s;e hu&s;band was a &s;tranger, Mr. Victor luckily happened to be more particu|lar. An attorney drew up the article in form, and a penalty of five hundred pounds annexed to it. The con&s;equence proved that he acted prudently; for Mr. Rich, manager of Covent-garden theatre, finding &s;he was engaged, in&s;i&s;ted on her breaking her articles, promi&s;ing to in|demnify her from all damage. A law&s;uit was then in&s;tituted, and after a tedious proce&s;s of three years Mr. Rich was at la&s;t obliged to pay the five hundred pounds penalty, with co&s;ts.</P>
<P>Soon after this it appeared that Mr. Wood|ward had embarked jointly with Mr. Barry in
<PB N="289" REF="322">
the grand &s;cheme he had on foot. No per&s;on could be &s;elected more proper for &s;uch an under|taking. Mr. Woodward had a great name in the theatrical world, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome property, and his character for hone&s;ty and punctuality would go far in e&s;tabli&s;hing a new dramatic &s;tate. Mr. Macklin al&s;o &s;eems to have been intere&s;ted on the &s;ame &s;ide, for on Mr. Victor's return from London, he met Mr. Barry and Mr. Macklin at Holyhead; they embarked together in the &s;ame packet, and landed at Dunleary the latter end of June.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, the walls of the late mu&s;ic-hall in Crow-&s;treet, and &s;everal adjacent buildings were levelled to the ground, and the foundation laid of the new theatre, which, as Mr. Victor prophetically ob&s;erved, was <HI>"A foundation of misfortunes to many."</HI> Mr. Barry and Mr. Macklin remained in Dublin till the September following, when the former having obtained a &s;ufficient number of &s;ub&s;cribers to the new thea|tre, and arranged every other matter relative to his great de&s;ign, they returned to London.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan finding every effort to prevent an oppo&s;ition ineffectual, endeavoured to make
<PB N="290" REF="323">
the be&s;t defence he could. Smock-alley theatre opened on the 10th of October 1757 with The Fair Quaker of Deal, and on the 24th he came for|ward him&s;elf in the character of Hamlet to a very good hou&s;e. And a few days after Mrs. Gregory, now Mrs. Fitzhenry, appeared in Ca|li&s;ta, a part &s;he always performed remarkably well, and was mo&s;t cordially received by the lov|ers of the drama. Mr. Foote al&s;o who continued with Mr. Sheridan, gave the public his Ben in Love for Love, Fondlewife, and a few other cha|racters. It has been remarked that in the la&s;t mentioned character Mr. Foote remembered that great ma&s;ter of acting, Colley Cibber, con&s;e|quently had the merit of imitating him tolerably well; but his Ben, Sir Paul Plyant, and mo&s;t of the characters he did not write him&s;elf, were not &s;o succe&s;sful. In his own pieces he &s;tood alone, and his original acting, good or bad, &s;et critici&s;m at defiance. At this, time he treated the public with his tea, at which it was the fa&s;hion to laugh.</P>
<P>At his tea table be introduced a young gentle|man as pupil to Mr. Puzzle, who &s;oon attracted the attention of the town and de&s;erves particular mention. This young gentleman's name was
<PB N="291" REF="324">
Wilkin&s;on, the &s;on of a clergyman of excellent character. Mr. Wilkin&s;on from his earlie&s;t years di&s;covered a peculiar inclination for the &s;tage, which as he grew up ripened into a &s;ettled determination of turning actor the fir&s;t opportunity. In con&s;equence of this de&s;ign he con&s;tantly frequented the theatres, and as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed extraordinary powers for imitation, few of the performers of any merit e&s;caped his critical notice.</P>
<P>About this time chance threw Mr. Foote in his way. Struck with the eccentricity of his genius, and the particularity of his manner, our hero's lively imagination delighted in exhibiting his peculiarities, in which he was remarkably &s;ucce&s;sful. Finding Mr. Foote engaged at Dublin, he voluntarily offered to accompany him over at his own expence. This being immediately accept|ed, they both arrived early in the winter. Mr. Foote being obliged to return in December, our young hero thought this a good opportunity for trying his abilities. He therefore determined to remain behind, and &s;oon after commenced his theatrical career with great eclat. Diffident of his own powers, he at fir&s;t only ventured to treat the
<PB N="292" REF="325">
audience with tea, (as the entertainment was called) in Mr. Foote's manner.</P>
<P>His &s;ucce&s;s in this attempt was &s;o great, that it emboldened him to higher pur&s;uits, and hav|ing played Cadwallader in the &s;tile of the author with remarkable applau&s;e, and given imitations of Mrs. Woffington, Mr. Sparks, with mo&s;t of the capital performers, and even of Mr. Foote him&s;elf, with great truth and humour, he on the 19th of January ventured on the arduous ta&s;k of &s;upporting the very difficult character of Othello. In this however, as he was perfectly conver&s;ant with Mr. Barry's &s;tile and manner, he greatly exceeded public expec|tation. After this he appeared in &s;everal other characters with much reputation, and having obtained an excellent benefit, he returned to England highly &s;atisfied with his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, and much plea&s;ed with the liberality and ho&s;pitality of the Iri&s;h nation.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to Mr. Wilkin&s;on it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, that independent of his powers of mimickry, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed capital abilities for the &s;tage. I have &s;pent &s;everal happy years under his command, and as far as my judgment can
<PB N="293" REF="326">
bear te&s;timony, have, during that time, &s;een him perform a variety of characters in tragedy and comedy, with great truth and merit. So very flattering was his reception in Dublin at that time, that we afterwards often find him making &s;hort, plea&s;ant, and profitable excur&s;ions to Ire|land, who&s;e audience he always pro&s;e&s;t the highe&s;t veneration for.</P>
<P>Fortune a few years afterwards rewarded his merits, and placed him at the head of the theatres-royal, York, Hull, and Leeds, paten|tee and &s;ole proprietor: as re&s;pectable a the|atrical &s;ituation as any out of London, where he has realized a con&s;iderable property, and over which theatres he &s;till continues to pre|&s;ide with the highe&s;t credit; an excellent ma|nager, univer&s;ally beloved and e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who have the happine&s;s of his acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now return, and introduce to my read|ers, one of the greate&s;t, and I hope I maybe allowed to &s;ay, one of the mo&s;t de&s;erving favou|rites the Dublin theatre ever boa&s;ted. On Wedne&s;day December 7th 1757, Mr. Foote was announced for Captain Brazen in the Re|cruiting
<PB N="294" REF="327">
Officer, and the part of Captain Plume by Mr. Ryder, being his fir&s;t appearance on this &s;tage. So valuable an acqui&s;ition pa&s;&s;ed not unnoticed; he was received with the warme&s;t applau&s;e. The genius of the drama adopted him as her own, whil&s;t the fo&s;tering hand of public approbation brought him forward, and crowned his endeavours with never-fading laurel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here enter into an inve&s;tigation of Mr. Ryder's various merits. Such an enquiry would in my opinion at pre&s;ent be too prema|ture, and will come with more propriety in the latter part of this work, when I mean to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject at large, and treat it with all the attention and judgment I am ma&s;ter of, unin|fluenced by fa&s;hion, or unprejudiced by party. Suffice it at pre&s;ent to &s;ay, that the fir&s;t night he di&s;played great abilities, which time after|wards matured and brought to perfection, and &s;o di&s;cernible was his merit, that the audience con&s;tantly embraced every opportunity of te&s;|tifying their &s;en&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The material events of this &s;ea&s;on be&s;ides tho&s;e I have mentioned were but few. The
<PB N="295" REF="328">
duke of Dor&s;et, then lord-lieutenant, was remark|ably fond of the drama, and with the duche&s;s con&s;tantly honoured the theatre with their pre|&s;ence once or twice a week. This fortunate at|tachment to the &s;tage not only rendered it fa&s;hion|able, but in&s;pired Mr Sheridan with hopes of being able to divert the impending &s;torm which for &s;ome time had been gathering round him. Crow-&s;treet theatre began now to rear its for|midable head, and threaten unknown dangers to poor Smock-alley. The public already began to divide in opinion. The pre&s;s teemed with publications from both parties. Each had an appearance of rea&s;on, and each had their parti|zans who e&s;pou&s;ed their re&s;pective intere&s;ts with all the warmth which &s;uch conte&s;ts u&s;ually in|&s;pire.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected that in this place I &s;hould give a review of the rea&s;ons advanced by each party. Tho&s;e offered by Mr. Sheridan again&s;t an oppo&s;ition, and the arguments made u&s;e of by Mr. Barry's and Mr. Woodward's friends again&s;t a theatrical monopoly. This I mu&s;t beg leave to decline for the pre&s;ent, and re&s;erve a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the pleadings u&s;ed on both &s;ides to a more proper period, which I take to be
<PB N="296" REF="329">
many years after, when the bill for an exclu&s;ive patent was brought into parliament and pa&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall then endeavour to throw every light in my power on the &s;ubject, and leave the reader free to form his judgment from a fair impartial review of the whole.</P>
<P>The manager finding all his endeavours to &s;top the progre&s;s of the building of the new theatre to be in vain, gave over the attempt and &s;trove to make the be&s;t defence the nature of his &s;itu|ation would admit. In March ju&s;t before the benefits commenced, he made application to the whole company in order to a&s;certain to a cer|tainty tho&s;e who would continue under his &s;tan|dard. He began with Mrs. Fitzhenry, who was a very great favourite that &s;ea&s;on. The &s;alary &s;he then had was five hundred pounds for the winter, this he offered her again, which &s;he declined. He then rai&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred pounds, well knowing that without her and a few of the principal performers it would be un|&s;afe for him to article with &s;o large a body of people, many of whom had great &s;alaries and were only u&s;eful. In return Mrs. Fitzhenry gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;he could come to no conclu&s;ion till &s;he had heard from the oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="297" REF="330">
party. This unexpected and rather unge|nerous proceeding &s;o incen&s;ed Mr. Sheridan, that in the warmth of re&s;entment he imprudently de|clared again&s;t entering into articles with any one. The con&s;equence of this ra&s;h declaration was, that Mr. King and Mr. Dexter not per|ceiving any certainty of their being retained, in a few days after &s;igned with Mr. Barry's attorney for the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus was the fir&s;t fatal blow given by Mrs. Fitzhenry. At that time &s;he &s;tood in the highe&s;t e&s;timation, and would have proved a powerful addition in either &s;cale. Had &s;he remained firm to the cau&s;e, the manager would cheerfully have entered into articles with every member of the company; which with the addition of Mr. Digges and Mrs. Ward expected from Edin|burgh, would, in all probability, have formed a force too &s;trong for any powers that could be brought again&s;t them. 'Tis true Mr. Barry and Mr. Woodward were the fir&s;t in their re&s;pective lines of playing. Yet the many unavoidable difficulties which &s;uch an undertaking is at fir&s;t involved in, e&s;pecially the collecting &s;uch a com|pany who&s;e merit would in any mea&s;ure accord with theirs, made their project rather hazardous.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="331">But be that as it might, the &s;udden and unex|pected lo&s;s of two capital performers of &s;uch con&s;equence as Mr. King and Mr. Dexter, alarmed Mr. Sheridan. He &s;aw his error, and endeavoured too late to retrieve it. He imme|diately &s;et about a vigorous oppo&s;ition. At the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;on Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Victor repaired to London, to endeavour to procure novelty for the winter. It was deter|mined to engage Mr. Digges and Mrs. Ward, who were to be in Dublin at the opening of the &s;ea&s;on, to &s;et forward in the tragedies, and Mr. Theophilus Cibber to &s;trengthen the comedies, as upon them they placed great reliance.</P>
<P>Fully aware of Mr. Woodward's great ex|cellence in pantomime, which they imagined would be one of the new manager's principal objects, they re&s;olved to oppo&s;e him in the be&s;t manner they could. Accordingly Mr. Sheridan purcha&s;ed of Mr. Ro&s;amon, the manager of Sadler's Wells, who&s;e pantomimes were then in great e&s;teem, an entire panto|mime. The &s;tory, mu&s;ic, &s;cenery and ma|chinery all complete for one hundred pounds, which originally co&s;t five. Mr. Ro&s;amon's

carpenter was al&s;o hired at the &s;ame time to &s;et out with the work, and &s;it it to Smock-alley &s;tage. Maddox, the celebrated wire-dancer was likewi&s;e articled for two hun|dred pounds, to be the Harlequin, and to ex|hibit his dexterity on the wire.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE opening of the theatrical campaign was now anxiou&s;ly looked for by both parties. Never till then had the public been &s;o divided, or intere&s;ted in the affairs of the drama. The
<PB N="301" REF="334">
leaders of each theatre were men &s;o eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, that they naturally excited the attention of the town.</P>
<P>The acknowledged abilities of Mr. Sheridan, the amiablene&s;s of his private character, his long tried and approved conducting of the &s;tage, joined to the unmerited treatment he &s;o recently received, mo&s;t de&s;ervedly &s;ecured him the friend|&s;hip of the &s;en&s;ible and judicious. The di&s;cern|ing few beheld with concern the approaching di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which in all probability would &s;peedily deprive them of that harmony and re|gularity which had been ju&s;t re&s;tored. But their weak efforts were ineffectual. The love of novelty is the darling pa&s;&s;ion of makind. 'Tis interwoven in our nature, and di&s;plays its pre+dominance on almo&s;t every occa&s;ion. But it is no where more con&s;picuous than in the fluctu|ating opinions of the public re&s;pecting the drama.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, many circum&s;tances operated in fa|vour of the new theatre. Mr. Barry had, even from his fir&s;t attempt, been a peculiar fa|vourite with the public, and &s;tood remarkably high in the general opinion. With ju&s;tice he was allowed to be, without exception, in a par|ticular
<PB N="302" REF="335">
line, the fir&s;t actor of the age. In private, per&s;ua&s;ion dwelt upon his tongue, he had the happy art of accommodating him&s;elf to the foibles and peculiarities of every per&s;on he conver&s;ed with, and his rhetoric never failed to accompli&s;h the mo&s;t difficult points he had to carry. In public, his extraordinary merit, beau|tiful figure, engaging manner, and the intere&s;t|ing ca&s;t of parts he played, all &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h his fame, and render him uncommonly popular. Mr. Woodward was a plain hone&s;t man, much admired in Ireland, who by great profe&s;&s;ional merit had &s;aved a tolerable fortune which ambi|tion urged him to venture upon a very uncer|tain foundation. The&s;e circum&s;tances with the aid of a new company, new theatre, &amp;c. &s;eemed to preponderate the &s;cale again&s;t the old hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On Monday the 23d of October 1758, the new theatre in Crow-&s;treet opened with an oc|ca&s;ional prologue &s;poken by Mr. Woodward. After which was performed the comedy of She Would And She Would Not, or the Kind Im|po&s;tor, written by Cibber, a very excellent act|ing comedy. The characters &s;u&s;tained in the following manner: Don Manuel, Mr. Arthur, from the Bath theatre; Don Philip, Mr. Jeffer|&s;on;
<PB N="303" REF="336">
Octavio, Mr. White; Soto, Mr. Lay|field; Diego, Mr. Mynitt; Don Lewis, Mr. Read; Corregidor, Mr. Younger, afterwards prompter at Covent-garden theatre; and Trap|panti, Mr. King; Ro&s;ara, Mrs. Knipe; Flora, Mi&s;s Willis; Viletta, Mrs. Mynitt; and Hy|polita, Mrs. Jeffer&s;on.</P>
<P>Except Mr. King who indeed was a great fa|vourite with the public, mo&s;t of the other names were unknown, &s;o that even the novelty of the fir&s;t night could not attract a numerous au|dience. Tho&s;e however who were there, &s;poke highly of the theatre, &s;cenery, and decorations, but the merits of the new performers &s;eemed but coldly reli&s;hed. The next night the new mana|gers gave the town a &s;pecimen of the abilities of the mu&s;ical part of their company in the Beggars Opera, where that excellent &s;inger Mr. Vernon made his fir&s;t appearance in Macheath, Mrs. Pye was the Lucy, Mrs. Chambers, a &s;weet &s;inger and very pretty figure, was the Polly. The&s;e, with a hornpipe from the celebrated Aldridge, con&s;tituted the novelty of that evening, and plea&s;ed better than the preceding, yet when repeated the night after did not bring above twenty pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="337">The&s;e bad hou&s;es alarmed the new managers, and made them take the field &s;ooner than they de&s;igned. On the third of November Mr. Barry came forward in Hamlet, when he was welcomed by a crowded and brilliant audience, who through his whole performance gave him the mo&s;t flat|tering te&s;timonies of their intended &s;upport and encouragement.</P>
<P>Having thus fairly launched our new comers, common civility obliges us to return to our de|&s;erving old friends, and enquire how they pro|ceed. With very unequal &s;pirits, and di&s;agree|able pro&s;pects did they prepare for the conte&s;t. Mr. Victor, the deputy manager, returned from London about the middle of October, and began to mu&s;ter his forces. But when it was known that Mr. Sheridan had not as yet left London, di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;may &s;at upon every countenance. However, a few days after, Mr. Brown, late manager of the Bath company, who had been engaged by Mr. Victor, arrived, and in their &s;ituation proved a mo&s;t fortunate acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The abilities of this gentleman yet live in the memory of many, and tho&s;e acknowledge that in a particular line, &s;uch as the Copper Captain,
<PB N="305" REF="338">
Benedict, Bra&s;s in the Confederacy, Don John in the Chances, &amp;c. they never &s;aw a better, not even Mr. Garrick excepted, though they were among&s;t his mo&s;t favourite parts. Had Mr. Brown come in a more fortunate &s;ea&s;on, doubtle&s;s he would have been of the highe&s;t &s;er|vice to the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;ed. As it was, though his extraordinary merit was confe&s;&s;ed and ad|mired, yet it was not &s;ufficient at fir&s;t to attract public notice.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown opened Smock-alley theatre with his Copper Captain. Mrs. Sheriffe from Bath, an actre&s;s of merit, played Margaritte, and Mrs. Kennedy, late Mi&s;s Orfeur, E&s;tifania. Their pro&s;pect indeed was highly di&s;agreeable. But twelve pounds the fir&s;t night. However what the audience wanted in numbers, they made up in applau&s;e, which was unbounded. The &s;econd night brought 281. and the third, near 40l. Afterwards it became the only e&s;ta|bli&s;hed comedy of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>About the &s;econd or third week after they opened, the &s;pirits of the Smock-alley company, which by that time had been much depre&s;&s;ed, were &s;omewhat rai&s;ed by the arrival of Mr. Digges,
<PB N="306" REF="339">
and Mrs. Ward from Edinburgh. The repu|tation of Mr. Digges had been rapidly ri&s;ing &s;ince his fir&s;t commencement, and he had ju&s;t quitted a kingdom, where he was as great a fa|vourite as ever Mr. Garrick was in London. With great judgment therefore was he pitched upon by Mr. Sheridan, as the only per&s;on likely to oppo&s;e Mr. Barry with any likelihood of &s;uc|ce&s;s. Mrs. Ward, though not a capital, was a very u&s;e&s;ul actre&s;s, and as far as they then knew, equal to any in that line at Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>But though a numerous train of mi&s;chiefs cer|tainly &s;prung from theatrical oppo&s;itions, yet one good they were evidently productive of, that was, the introducing at &s;uch times a greater number of eminent performers to the public notice, than one theatre could po&s;&s;ibly admit of. The pre&s;ent moment is, among&s;t many others, an evident in&s;tance of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. There were in Dublin at this time, Mr. Barry, Mr. Digges, Mr. Dexter, Mr. Heaphy, Mr. Sowdon, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, Mr. Walker, Mr. Woodward, Mr. King, Mr. Ryder, Mr. Brown, Mr. I&s;aac Sparks, Mr. Arthur, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Glover, Mr. Francis Aickin, Mr. Stayley, Mr. Vernon, Mr. Wilder, &amp;c. Mrs. Fitzhenry,
<PB N="307" REF="340">
Mrs. Ward, the two Mi&s;s Philips, Mrs. Chal|mers, mother to the pre&s;ent Mr. Chalmers, a good actre&s;s in tragedy and genteel comedy. Mrs. Chambers, Mrs. Storer, Mrs. Kennedy, Mi&s;s Ma&s;on, Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Jeffer&s;on, &amp;c. and Mrs. Dancer.</P>
<P>To an oppo&s;ition we certainly are indebted for &s;o immediate a knowledge of the la&s;t men|tioned inimitable actre&s;s. This lady was born at Bath, had been but a &s;hort time on the &s;tage, and was engaged from the theatre-royal York at a venture, ignorant of her great merit or of the excellence which &s;he afterwards di&s;played. The fir&s;t appearance which this darling child of nature made in Ireland, was at Crow-&s;treet thea|tre, in the part of Cordelia to Mr. Barry's Lear, the 8th of November 1758, and her &s;econd was Monimia in the Orphan, characters well cho&s;en, e&s;pecially the latter, to di&s;play the pa|thetic powers, and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility which &s;o peculiarly characteri&s;e her acting above all others. Ju&s;tice however obliges me to confe&s;s, that her fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on did not promi&s;e that perfection &s;he has &s;ince attained, and that many of her fir&s;t efforts were regarded by the public eye with coldne&s;s and indifference. Hence 'tis highly
<PB N="308" REF="341">
probable but for the in&s;tructions of &s;o great a ma&s;ter as Mr. Barry, Mrs. Crawford had never arrived at her pre&s;ent excellence.</P>
<P>As this volume has already extended beyond the limits I at fir&s;t intended, I &s;hall defer enter|ing into a critical examination of the re&s;pective abilities of the performers I have hitherto men|tioned, till the &s;econd volume, in the cour&s;e of which I mean to attempt the &s;ubject, and en|deavour, as far as in my power lies, to place in a fair point of view the different merits of Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Barry, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, Mr. Digges, Mr. Woodward, Mr. Ryder, Mrs. Dancer, Mrs. Fitzhenry, &amp;c. In the mean while I mu&s;t return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Though there were a number of excellent performers in each company, yet the general opinion ran &s;trongly in favour of Crow-&s;treet theatre. But the arrival of Mr. Sheridan with a reinforcement from Sadler's Wells, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Theophilus Cibber, would it was hoped re&s;tore the balance. Meantime Mr. Digges and Mrs. Ward opened in Ha&s;tings and Jane Shore, and were extremely well received. As they were the originals in Mr. Hume's new
<PB N="309" REF="342">
tragedy of Douglas, and had performed it a number of nights with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s at Edinburgh, it was got ready with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition, and notwith&s;tanding it was announced at the other theatre, it was brought out and acted &s;everal nights to tolerable hou&s;es, without being attempted at Crow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>But this was only a temporary relief, for the &s;hip that contained the pantomime, Mr. Maddox the wire-dancer, and Mr. Theophilus Cibber, with upwards of &s;eventy pa&s;&s;engers be&s;ides, pe|ri&s;hed in a dreadful &s;tormy night in November, on the coa&s;t of Scotland. This was a fatal &s;troke, and was quickly followed by another; Mr. Sheridan, on whom they placed their &s;ole dependence, declined coming over. Mr. Victor ob&s;erves "that he certainly intended it, and in con&s;equence put him&s;elf to great inconvenience in the &s;ummer by advancing the money nece&s;&s;ary for purcha&s;ing and forwarding the &s;cenery and machinery of the pantomime, and other relative expences. And be&s;ides that lo&s;s, by his not coming he knew a lo&s;ing &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t be the con&s;equence; therefore that he was prevented by the unhappy &s;ituation of his affairs from coming to &s;erve him&s;elf as well as his company, mu&s;t be called his <HI>misfortune,</HI> and not his <HI>fault.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="343">No &s;ooner was it known that Mr. Sheridan had given up the idea of returning to Ireland, than Mrs. Fitzhenry who till then had remained neuter, though &s;ix hundred pounds &s;alary had been offered her by Mr. Victor, accepted of Mr. Barry's terms, and in ha&s;te &s;igned articles. This was the fini&s;hing &s;troke to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, both their friends and the public then gave them up as lo&s;t. There being now no po&s;&s;ibility of their contending, Mr. Victor propo&s;ed as the only re&s;ource, that benefits &s;hould commence in January, and to get through them as well as their circum&s;tances would admit. The&s;e would keep them, till the latter end of March. At that time he was promi&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Macklin and his daughter, for a dozen nights, when by their novelty, and by exhibiting a new piece or two of Mr. Macklin's writing, he was in hopes they might clo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on with &s;ome little advantage.</P>
<P>This offer, as their dernier re&s;ort, was cheer|fully embraced by the company. Benefits im|mediately began, and, con&s;idering the &s;ituation of affairs, were in general remarkably &s;ucce&s;sful, upwards of three thou&s;and pounds being taken in twenty-eight nights. As there were &s;ome
<PB N="311" REF="344">arrears due to the performers, owing to the bad|ne&s;s of the receipts at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, Mr. Victor took but &s;ixteen pounds in ca&s;h from each, to pay the contingencies, as mu&s;ic, &s;er|vants, &amp;c. and allowed every per&s;on twenty-four pounds of their arrears, which made forty pounds, the &s;um then u&s;ually paid by each per|former for their benefit charges.</P>
<P>Meantime the new managers experienced but a moderate &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s, especially con&s;ider|ing the great novelty they had produced. How|ever, every thing was conducted with regularity, &s;alaries were punctually paid, and harmony per|vaded the whole. The company was acknowledg|ed to be remarkably well cho&s;en. Mr. Barry, Mr. Sowden, who had gone over to their party, Mr. Dexter, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, Mrs. Fitzhenry, and Mrs. Dancer, &s;upported the tragedies with great eclat. And many of the comedies, with, their aid in a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mr. King and Mr. Woodward, were mo&s;t capitally performed. Towards the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on the pantomime of Har|lequin Fortunatus was got up under Mr. Wood|ward's direction, and brought out with great applau&s;e. This has always been e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ort of exhibitions. The
<PB N="312" REF="345">
&s;tory is regular and plea&s;ing, the mu&s;ic well adapted, and the tricks good. It has often been revived in Ireland &s;ince that time, and generally an&s;wers the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>About this time the Smock-alley company received their final &s;entence. Mr. Macklin on whom they had placed their la&s;t hopes, informed Mr. Victor the latter end of March, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to fulfil his promi&s;e, as his daughter's ill &s;tate of health would not permit her to undertake &s;uch a journey and voyage. On the receipt of this letter, Mr. Victor found it impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand their fate any longer, and having received Mr. Sheridan's in&s;tructions how to proceed, he on the 20th of April a&s;&s;em|bled the whole company, when he communi|cated this la&s;t piece of intelligence, and then candidly proceeded to inform them, that &s;uch unfore&s;een di&s;appointments had rendered it ut|terly out of his power to keep them any longer together, therefore he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;olving the company from acting any longer on Mr. Sheridan's account, and to clo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="346">But in this di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, as he wi&s;hed to render them every &s;ervice in his power, that the theatre, clothes, and &s;cenes were at their &s;ervice as long as they would find it expedient. Fully convinced of the propriety of this conduct, which circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified, the company accepted of this propo&s;al, and in a few days they drew up the following adverti&s;ement which they publi&s;hed, &s;igned by the principal performers of the community.</P>

<P>This adverti&s;ement produced very little good, the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced, and the public were not &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in their misfor|tunes. They played a few nights to bad hou&s;es, and were obliged to clo&s;e the 28th of May, as
<PB N="315" REF="348">
their opponents did on the 6th of June, with the pompous tragedy of Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>We have now arrived at that period of dra|matic hi&s;tory, which finally clo&s;es Mr. Sheridan's management. Here, with my reader's leave, I &s;hall pau&s;e, and in ju&s;t compliment to the vir|tues of &s;o eminent a man, to whom the &s;tage has &s;o many obligations, clo&s;e the fir&s;t volume of this work.&mdash;</P>
<P>Sincerely lamenting, that &s;uch unparalleled treatment &s;hould be the reward of &s;o many years &s;pent in a pur&s;uit &s;o noble as the advancement of the drama. And heartily wi&s;hing, that in&s;tead of his native country, his happier &s;tars had placed him at the head of a London theatre, where, in all probability, long ere this, Fortune had crowned his labours, and Fame, in pre&s;enting the bu&s;t of Garrick to po&s;terity, had re&s;erved a place for Sheridan, encircled with a portion of tho&s;e wreaths, which at pre&s;ent &s;o ju&s;tly adorn the brows of our immortal Ro&s;cius.</P>
