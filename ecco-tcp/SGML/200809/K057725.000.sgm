<L>To make the &s;tage a vehicle of wit,</L>

<L>In their odd fancies, we our own perceive,</L>
<L>For on &s;ome hobby hor&s;e all mankind live:</L>
<L>The politician, who&s;e all-conquering pate,</L>
<L>Is fill'd with nothing but affairs of &s;tate;</L>

<P>WELL, you tell me love has made a a progre&s;s in both their bo&s;oms; but &s;ay, Trim, how does my brother Toby &s;tand the a&s;&s;aults of the widow Wadman?</P>

<P>My ma&s;ter, his honor the captain, and your ma&s;ter his wor&s;hip, Mr. Shandy, could not be match'd in a day's march, Su&s;an;&mdash;good hearts! when the unfortunate claim a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they fling down their money with that &s;pirited jerk of an ho|ne&s;t welcome with which generous &s;ouls only are able to fling down money;&mdash;For each man's &s;or|row they have a tear, for each man's need they have a &s;hilling&mdash;may heaven ever ble&s;s them both.</P>

<SPEAKER>Su&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>La! Mr. Trim, I thought as how you gen|tlemen of the army never pray'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not half an hour, Su&s;an, &s;ince I heard Lieutenant Lefevre, a &s;oldier, and a brave
<PB N="3" REF="10">
&s;oldier pray devoutly; a &s;oldier, Su&s;an, prays as often of his own accord as a par&s;on; and when he's fighting for his king, and for his country, and for his own life, and for his honor too, he has the mo&s;t rea&s;on to pray to heaven, of any man in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Su&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Mr. Trim.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when a &s;oldier, my dear girl, has been &s;tanding twelve hours in the trenches&mdash;</P>

<P>A great while to &s;tand indeed, Mr. Trim.</P>

<STAGE>(wheeling to the left)</STAGE>
re&s;ting this night per|haps upon his arms&mdash;beat up the next in his &s;hirt &mdash;benumb'd in his joints, without &s;traw in his tent to kneel on, he mu&s;t &s;ay his prayers how and when he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Su&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it's my opinion when a &s;oldier gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as any par&s;on of them all, though not with &s;o much fu&s;s and hy|pocri&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't &s;ay that, Su&s;an; heaven only knows who is hypocrite and who is not; at the great and general review of all, and not till then, it will be &s;een who have de&s;erted from their duty in this world, and who have &s;tood to their po&s;ts, and we &s;hall be advanced accordingly
