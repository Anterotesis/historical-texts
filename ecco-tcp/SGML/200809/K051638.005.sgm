<HEAD><HI>LETTER I.</HI> Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>. Upper-FLa&s;k, Ham&s;tead, Friday (June <HI>9</HI>) morn. <HI>7</HI> o'clock.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM now here, and here have been this hour and half. What an indu&s;trious &s;pirit have I! Nobody can &s;ay, that I eat the bread of idlene&s;s. I take true pains for all the plea&s;ure I enjoy. I can|not choo&s;e but to admire my&s;elf &s;trangely; for, cer|tainly, with this active &s;oul, I &s;hould have made a very great figure in whatever &s;tation I had filled. But had I been a prince! &mdash; To be &s;ure I &s;hould have made a mo&s;t <HI>noble</HI> prince! I &s;hould have led up a military dance equal to that of the great Macedonian. I &s;hould have added kingdom to kingdom, and rob|bed all my neighbour-&s;overeigns, in order to have obtained the name of <HI>Robert the Great.</HI> And I would have gone to war with the Great Turk, and the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Per&s;ian, and the Mogholl, for their Seraglios; for not one of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Monarchs &s;hould have had a pretty woman to ble&s;s him&s;elf with, till I had done with her.</P>
<P>And now I have &s;o much lei&s;ure upon my hands, that, after having informed my&s;elf of all nece&s;&s;ary par|ticulars, I am &s;et to my &s;hort-hand writing, in order to keep up with time as well as I can: For the &s;ubject is now become worthy of me; and it is yet too &s;oon, I doubt, to pay my compliments to my charmer, after all her fatigues for two or three days pa&s;t: And, moreover, I have abundance of matters preparative to my future proceedings, to recount, in order to connect, and render all intelligible.</P>
<P>I parted with the captain at the foot of the hill, trebly in&s;tructed; that is to &s;ay, as to the <HI>Fact,</HI> to the <HI>Probable,</HI> and to the <HI>Po&s;&s;ible.</HI> If my beloved and I can meet and make up, without the mediation of this worthy gentleman, it will be &s;o much the better. As little foreign aid, as po&s;&s;ible, in my amorous con|flicts, has always been a rule with me; tho' here I have been obliged to call in &s;o much. And who knows but it may be the better for her, the le&s;s &s;he makes nece&s;&s;ary? I cannot bear, that &s;he &s;hould &s;it &s;o indifferent to me, as to be in earne&s;t to part with me for ever, upon &s;o <HI>&s;light,</HI> or even upon <HI>any</HI> occa&s;ion. <HI>If I find &s;he is</HI>&mdash;But no more threatenings till &s;he is in my power&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t what I have vowed.</P>
<P>All Will's account, from the lady's flight to his finding her again, all the accounts of the people of the hou&s;e, the coachman's information to Will, and &s;o forth, collected together, &s;tand thus.</P>
<Q><P>The Ham&s;tead coach, when the lady came to it, had but two pa&s;&s;engers in it. But &s;he made the fellow go off directly, paying for the vacant places.</P>
<P>The two pa&s;&s;engers directing the coachman to &s;et them down at the Upper-Fla&s;k, &s;he bid him &s;et her down there al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
They took leave of her (very re&s;pectfully no doubt), and &s;he went into the hou&s;e, and a&s;ked, If &s;he could not have a di&s;h of tea, and a room to her|&s;elf for half an hour?</P></Q>
<P><Q>They &s;hewed her up to the very room where I now am. She &s;at at the very table I now write upon; and, I believe, the chair I &s;it in was hers.</Q>
O Belford, if thou knowe&s;t what Love is, thou wilt be able to account for the&s;e <HI>minutiae.</HI></P>
<Q><P>She &s;eemed &s;piritle&s;s and fatigued. The gentle|woman her&s;elf cho&s;e to attend &s;o genteel and lovely a gue&s;t. She a&s;ked her, If &s;he would have bread and butter to her tea? No. She could not eat. They had very good bi&s;cakes. As &s;he plea&s;ed. The gentlewoman &s;tept out for &s;ome; and returning on a &s;udden, &s;he ob&s;erved the &s;weet fugitive endeavour|ing to re&s;train a violent bur&s;t of grief, which &s;he had given way to, in that little interval.</P>
<P>However, when the tea came, &s;he made her &s;it down with her, and a&s;ked her abundance of que&s;ti|ons about the villages and roads in that neighbour|hood.</P>
<P>The gentlewoman took notice to her, <HI>that &s;he &s;eemed to be troubled in mind.</HI></P></Q>
<P><Q>Tender Spirits, &s;he replied, could not part with <HI>dear</HI> friends without concern.</Q> She meant <HI>me,</HI> no doubt.</P>
<Q>She made no inquiry about a lodging, tho' by the &s;equel, thou'lt ob&s;erve, that &s;he &s;eemed to in|tend to go no farther that night than Ham&s;tead. But after &s;he had drank two di&s;hes, and put a Bi&s;cake in her pocket&mdash;[Sweet &s;oul, to &s;erve for her &s;upper perhaps&mdash;] &s;he laid down half-a-crown; and re|fu&s;ing change, &s;ighing, took leave, &s;aying, &s;he would proceed towards Hendon; the di&s;tance to which had been one of her que&s;tions.</Q>
<P><Q>They offered to &s;end to know, if a Ham&s;tead coach were not to go to Hendon that evening. No
<PB N="4" REF="5">
matter, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;Perhaps &s;he might meet the cha|riot.</Q> Another of her <HI>feints,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e; for how, or with whom, could any thing of this &s;ort have been concerted &s;ince ye&s;terday morning?</P>
<Q><P>She had, as the people took notice to one an|other, &s;omething &s;o uncommonly noble in her air, and in her per&s;on and behaviour, that they were &s;ure &s;he was of quality. And having no &s;ervant with her of either &s;ex, her eyes [her fine eyes, the gentlewoman called them, &s;tranger as &s;he was, and a woman!] being &s;welled and red, they were &s;ure there was an elopement in the ca&s;e, either from parents or guardians; for they &s;uppo&s;ed her too young and too maidenly to be a married lady: And were &s;he married, no hu&s;band would let &s;uch a fine young creature be unattended and alone; nor give her cau&s;e for &s;o much grief, as &s;eemed to be &s;ettled in her countenance. Then, at times, &s;he &s;eemed to be &s;o bewildred, they &s;aid, that they were afraid &s;he had it in her head to make away with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things put together, excited their curi|o&s;ity; and they engaged a <HI>peery</HI> &s;ervant, as they called a footman who was drinking with Kit the ho&s;tler at the tap-hou&s;e, to watch all her motions. This fellow reported the following particulars, as they were re-reported to me.</P>
<P>She indeed went towards Hendon, pa&s;&s;ing by the &s;ign of the Ca&s;tle on the heath; then, &s;topping, looked about her, and down into the valley before her. Then, turning her face towards London, &s;he &s;eemed, by the motion of her handkerchief to her eyes, to weep; repenting (who knows?) the ra&s;h &s;tep &s;he had taken, and wi&s;hing her&s;elf back again&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>Better for her, if &s;he do, Jack, once more I &s;ay! &mdash;Woe be to the girl who could think of marrying
<PB N="5" REF="6">
me, yet be able to run away from me, and renounce me for ever!</P>
<Q>Then, continuing on a few paces, &s;he &s;topt again; and, as if di&s;liking her road, again &s;eem|ing to weep, directed her cour&s;e back towards Ham&s;tead.</Q>
<P>I am glad &s;he wept &s;o much, becau&s;e no heart bur&s;ts (be the occa&s;ion for the &s;orrow what it will) which has that kindly relief. Hence I hardly ever am moved at the &s;ight of the&s;e pellucid fugitives in a fine woman. How often, in the pa&s;t twelve hours, have I wi&s;hed, that I could cry mo&s;t confoundedly!</P>
<P><Q>She then &s;aw a coach and four driving towards her empty. She cro&s;&s;ed the path &s;he was in, as if to meet it; and &s;eemed to intend to &s;peak to the coachman, had he &s;topt, or &s;poke fir&s;t. He, as earne&s;tly, looked at <HI>her.</HI> Every one did &s;o, who pa&s;&s;ed her (&s;o the man who dogg'd her was the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected)</Q>
&mdash;Happy rogue of a coachman, had&s;t thou known who&s;e notice thou did&s;t engage, and whom thou mighte&s;t have obliged!&mdash;It was the divine Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe at whom thou gazed&s;t!&mdash;My own Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash;But it was well for me that thou wert as undi&s;tingui&s;hing as the bea&s;ts thou drove&s;t; otherwi&s;e, what a wild-goo&s;e chace had I been led?</P>
<Q><P>The lady, as well as the coachman, in &s;hort, &s;eemed to want re&s;olution; the hor&s;es kept on; the fellow's head and eyes, no doubt, turned behind him; and the di&s;tance &s;oon lengthened beyond re|call. With a wi&s;tful eye &s;he looked after him; &s;ighed and wept again; as the &s;ervant, who then &s;lily pa&s;&s;ed her, ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>By this time &s;he had reached the hou&s;es. She looked up at every one, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; now-and-then breathing upon her bared hand, and applying it to her &s;welled eyes, to abate the redne&s;s, and dry the tears. At la&s;t, &s;eeing a bill up for letting lodgings, &s;he walked backwards and forwards half a dozen
<PB N="6" REF="7">
times, as if unable to determine what to do. And then went farther into the town; and there the fellow being &s;poken to by one of his familiars, he lo&s;t her for a few minutes: But &s;oon &s;aw her come out of a linen-drapery &s;hop, attended with a &s;ervant-maid, having, as he believed, bought &s;ome little matters, and, as it proved, got that maid-&s;ervant to go with her to the hou&s;e &s;he is now at <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>353.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fellow, after waiting about an hour, and not &s;eeing her come out, returned, concluding that &s;he had taken lodgings there.</P></Q>
<P>And here, &s;uppo&s;ing my narrative of the dramatic kind, ends Act the Fir&s;t. And now begins,</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="act">
<HEAD>ACT II.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>SCENE,</HI> Ham&s;tead Heath continued.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter my Ra&s;cal.</STAGE>
<P>WILL. having got at all the&s;e particulars, by ex|changing others as frankly again&s;t them, which I had formerly prepared him with, both verbally and in writing; I found the people already of my party, and full of good wi&s;hes for my &s;ucce&s;s, repeating to me all they told him.</P>
<P>But he had fir&s;t acquainted me with the accounts he had given them of his lady and me. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I give thee the particulars of his tale&mdash;And I have a little time upon my hands; for the maid of the hou&s;e, who had been out of an errand, tells us, that &s;he &s;aw Mrs. Moore (with whom mu&s;t be my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s) go into the hou&s;e of a young gentleman, within a few doors of her, who has a maiden &s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s Rawlins by name, <HI>&s;o notify'd</HI> for prudence, that none of her acquaintance undertake any thing of con&s;equence, without con&s;ulting her.</P>
<P>Mean while my hone&s;t coachman is walking about Mi&s;s Rawlins's door, in order to bring me notice of Mrs. Moore's return to her own hou&s;e. I hope her
<PB N="7" REF="8">
go&s;&s;ips-tale will be as &s;oon told as mine. Which take as follows.</P>
<P>Will told them, before I came,
<Q>That his lady was but lately married to one of the fine&s;t gentle|men in the world. But that, he being very gay and lively, &s;he was <HI>mortal</HI> jealous of him; and in a fit of that &s;ort, had eloped from him. For altho' &s;he loved him dearly, and he doated upon her (as well he might, &s;ince, as they had &s;een, &s;he was the fine&s;t creature <HI>that ever the &s;un &s;hone upon</HI>), yet &s;he was apt to be very wilful and &s;ullen, if he might take the liberty to &s;ay &s;o&mdash;but truth was truth;&mdash;and if &s;he could not have her own way in every thing, would be for leaving him. That &s;he had three or four times played his ma&s;ter &s;uch tricks; but with all the virtue and innocence in the world; running away to an intimate friend of hers, who, tho' a young lady of honour, was but too indulgent to her in this her <HI>only</HI> failing: for which rea&s;on his ma&s;ter had brought her to London lodgings; their u&s;ual re&s;idence being in the country: And that, on his refu&s;ing to &s;atisfy her about a lady he had been &s;een with in the park, &s;he had, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince &s;he came to town, &s;erved his ma&s;ter thus: Whom he had left half-di&s;tracted on that account.</Q></P>
<P>And truly well he might, poor gentleman! cried the hone&s;t folks, pitying me be ore they &s;aw me.</P>
<P><Q>He told them how he came by his intelligence of her; and made him&s;elf &s;uch an intere&s;t with them, that they helped him to a change of cloaths for him|&s;elf; and the landlord, at his reque&s;t, privately inquired, if the lady actually remained at Mrs. Moore's; and for how long &s;he had taken the lodgings: Which he found only to be for a week certain: But &s;he had &s;aid, that &s;he believed &s;he &s;hould hardly &s;tay &s;o long. And then it was that he wrote his letter, and &s;ent it by hone&s;t Peter Partrick, as thou ha&s;t heard.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">When I came, my per&s;on and dre&s;s having an&s;wered Will's de&s;cription, the people were ready to wor&s;hip me. I now-and-then &s;ighed, now-and-then put on a lighter air; which, however, I de&s;igned &s;hould &s;hew more of vexation ill-di&s;gui&s;ed, than of real chearfulne&s;s: And they told Will, It was a thou&s;and pities &s;o fine a lady &s;hould have &s;uch <HI>&s;kitti&s;h tricks</HI>; adding, that &s;he might expo&s;e her&s;elf to great dangers by them; for that there were Rakes every-where [<HI>Lovelace's in every corner, Jack!</HI>], and many about that town, who would leave nothing unattempted to get into her company: And altho' they might not prevail upon her, yet might they neverthele&s;s hurt her reputation; and, in time, e&s;trange the affections of &s;o fine a gentleman from her.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;ible people, the&s;e!&mdash;Hay, Jack!</P>
<P>Here, landlord; one word with you. My &s;ervant, I find, has acquainted you with the rea&s;on of my coming this way. An unhappy affair, landlord! A very unhappy affair! But never was there a more virtuous woman.</P>
<P>So, Sir, &s;he &s;eems to be. A thou&s;and pities her lady&s;hip has &s;uch ways&mdash;And to &s;o good-humoured a gentleman as you &s;eem to be, Sir.</P>
<P>Mother-&s;poilt, landlord!&mdash;Mother-&s;poilt! that's the thing!&mdash;But, &s;ighing, I mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it. What I want <HI>you</HI> to do for me, is to lend me a great coat. I care not what it is. If my &s;pou&s;e &s;hould &s;ee me at a di&s;tance, &s;he would make it very difficult for me to get at her &s;peech. A great coat with a cape, if you have one. I mu&s;t come upon her be|fore &s;he is aware.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Sir, I have none fit for &s;uch a gentle|man as you.</P>
<P>O, any thing will do!&mdash;The wor&s;e the better.</P>
<STAGE>Exit landlord. Re-enter with two great coats.</STAGE>
<P>Ay, landlord, This will be be&s;t; for I can button
<PB N="9" REF="10">
the cape over the lower part of my face. Don't I look devili&s;hly down and concern'd, landlord?</P>
<P>I never &s;aw a gentleman with a better-natured look. 'Tis pity you &s;hould have &s;uch tryals, Sir.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be very unhappy, no doubt of it, landlord. And yet I am a little pleas'd, you mu&s;t needs think, that I have found her out before any great inconve|nience has ari&s;en to her. However, if I cannot break her of the&s;e freaks, &s;he'll break my heart; for I do love her with all her failings.</P>
<P>The good woman, who was within hearing of all this, pitied me much.</P>
<P>Pray, your honour, &s;aid &s;he, if I may be &s;o bold, was madam ever a mamma?</P>
<P>No!&mdash;and I &s;ighed&mdash;We have been but a little while married; and, as I may &s;ay to <HI>you,</HI> it is her own fault that &s;he is not in that way [Not a word of a lye in this, Jack]. But to tell you truth, madam, &s;he may be compared to the dog in the manger&mdash;</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Sir, (&s;impering)&mdash;She is but young, Sir. I have heard of one or two &s;uch &s;kitti&s;h young ladies in my time, Sir.&mdash;But when madam is in that way, I dare &s;ay, as &s;he loves you (and it would be &s;trange if &s;he did not!), all this will be over, and &s;he may make the be&s;t of wives.</P>
<P>That's all my hope.</P>
<P>She is as fine a lady as I ever beheld. I hope, Sir, you won't be too &s;evere. She'll get over all the&s;e freaks, if once &s;he be a mamma, I warrant.</P>
<P>I can't be &s;evere to her; &s;he knows that. The moment I &s;ee her, all re&s;entment is over with me, if &s;he give me but one kind look.</P>
<P>All this time, I was adju&s;ting my hor&s;eman's coat, and Will was putting in the ties of my wig, and buttoning the cape over my chin.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd the gentlewoman for a little powder. She brought me a powder-box, and I lightly &s;hook the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
puff over my hat, and flapt one &s;ide of it, tho' the lace look'd a little too gay for my covering; and &s;louching it over my eyes, Shall I be known, think you, Madam?</P>
<P>Your honour is &s;o expert, Sir!&mdash;I wi&s;h, if I may be &s;o bold, your lady has not &s;ome <HI>cau&s;e</HI> to be jealous. But it will be impo&s;&s;ible, if you keep your laced cloaths covered, that any-body &s;hould know you in that dre&s;s to be the &s;ame gentleman&mdash;Except they find you out by your clocked &s;tockens.</P>
<P>Well ob&s;erv'd&mdash;Can't you, landlord, lend or &s;ell me a pair of &s;tockens, that will draw over the&s;e? I can cut off the feet, if they won't go into my &s;hoes.</P>
<P>He could let me have a pair of coar&s;e, but clean, &s;tirrup-&s;tockens, if I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The be&s;t in the world for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He fetch'd them. Will. drew them on; and my legs then made a good gouty appearance.</P>
<P>The good woman, &s;miling, wi&s;hed me &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;o did the landlord: And as thou knowe&s;t that I am not a bad mimic, I took a cane, which I borrowed of the landlord, and &s;tooped in the &s;houlders to a quarter of a foot of le&s;s height, and &s;tump'd away cro&s;s to the Bowling-green, to practi&s;e a little the hobbling gaite of a gouty man. The landlady whi&s;per'd her hu&s;band, as Will. tells me, He's a good one, I warrant him!&mdash;I dare &s;ay the fault lies not all of one &s;ide. While mine ho&s;t replied, that I was &s;o lively and &s;o good-natur'd a gentleman, that he did not know who could be angry with me, do what I would. A &s;en&s;ible fellow!&mdash;I wi&s;h my charmer were of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>And now I am going to try, if I can't agree with goody Moore for lodgings and other conveniencies for my &s;ick wife.</P>
<P>Wife, Lovelace! methinks thou interrogate&s;t.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>wife</HI>; for who knows what cautions the dear fugitive may have given in apprehen&s;ion of me?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">But has goody Moore any other lodgings to let?</P>
<P>Yes, yes; I have taken care of that; and find, that &s;he has ju&s;t &s;uch conveniencies as I want. And I know that my wife will like them. For, altho' married, I can do every thing I plea&s;e; and that's a bold word, you know. But had &s;he only a garret to let, I would have liked it; and been a poor author afraid of arre&s;ts, and made that my place of refuge; yet would have made &s;hift to pay beforehand for what I had. I can &s;uit my&s;elf to any condition, that's my comfort.</P>
<P>THE widow Moore return'd! &s;ay you&mdash;Down, down, flutterer!&mdash;This impertinent heart is more trouble&s;ome to me than my con&s;cience, I think.&mdash; I &s;hall be obliged to hoar&s;en my voice, and roughen my character, to keep up with its puppily dancings.</P>
<P>But, let me &s;ee,&mdash;Shall I be angry or plea&s;ed, when I am admitted to my beloved's pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>Angry, to be &s;ure.&mdash;Has &s;he not broken her word with me?&mdash;At a time, too, when I was meditating to do her grateful ju&s;tice?&mdash;And is not breach of word a dreadful crime in good folks? I have ever been for forming my judgment of the nature of things and actions, not &s;o much from what they are in them&s;elves, as from the character of the actors. Thus it would be as odd a thing in &s;uch as we to <HI>keep</HI> our words with a lady, as it would be wicked in her to <HI>break</HI> hers to us.</P>
<P>See&s;t thou not, that this un&s;ea&s;onable gravity is ad|mitted to quell the palpitations of this unmanageable heart? But &s;till it will go on with its boundings. I'll try, as I ride in my chariot, to <HI>tranquillize.</HI></P>
<P>Ride, Bob! &s;o little a way?</P>
<P>Yes, ride, Jack; for am I not lame? And will it not look well to have a lodger who keeps his chariot? What widow, what &s;ervant, a&s;ks que&s;tions of a man with an equipage?</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">My coachman, as well as my other &s;ervant, is un|der Will's tuition.</P>
<P>Never was there &s;uch a hideous ra&s;cal as he has made him&s;elf. The devil only, and his other ma&s;ter, can know him. They both have &s;et their marks up|on him.

<HEAD>LETTER II. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Friday Night, June</HI> 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, Belford, for the narrative of narratives. I will continue it, as I have opportunity; and that &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that if I break off twenty times, thou &s;halt not di&s;cern where I piece my thread.</P>
<P>Although grievou&s;ly afflicted with the gout, I alight|ed out of my chariot (leaning very hard on my cane with one hand, and on my new &s;ervant's &s;houlder with the other) the &s;ame in&s;tant almo&s;t that he had knock'd at the door, that I might be &s;ure of admi&s;&s;ion into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I took care to button my great coat about me, and to cover with it even the pommel of my &s;word; it being a little too gay for my years. I knew not what occa&s;ion I might have for my &s;word. I &s;toop'd forward; blink'd with my eyes to conceal their lu&s;tre [No vanity in &s;aying that, Jack!]; my chin wrapt up for the tooth-ach; my &s;louch'd, laced hat, and &s;o much of my wig as was vi&s;ible, giving me, all together, the appearance of an antiquated beau.</P>
<P>My wife, I re&s;olved beforehand, &s;hould have a complication of di&s;orders.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">The maid came to the door. I a&s;k'd for her mi&s;tre&s;s. She &s;hew'd me into one of the parlours; and I &s;at down, with a gouty Oh!&mdash;</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter goody</HI> Moore.</STAGE>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Madam&mdash;but you mu&s;t excu&s;e me; I cannot well &s;tand.&mdash;I find by the bill at the door, that you have lodgings to let [Mumbling my words as if, like my man Will, I had lo&s;t &s;ome of my fore|teeth]: Be plea&s;ed to inform me what they are; for I like your &s;ituation:&mdash;And I will tell you my family &mdash;I have a wife, a good old woman&mdash;Older than my|&s;elf, by the way, a pretty deal. She is in a bad &s;tate of health, and is advi&s;ed into the Ham&s;tead air. She will have two maid-&s;ervants and a footman. The coach or chariot (I &s;hall not have them up both to|gether), we can put up any-where, and the coachman will be with his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>When, Sir, &s;hall you want to come in?</P>
<P>I will take them from this very day; and, if con|venient, will bring my wife in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, you would board, as well as lodge?</P>
<P>That as you plea&s;e. It will &s;ave me the trouble of bringing my cook, if we do. And I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;ervants who know how to dre&s;s a couple of di&s;hes. My wife mu&s;t eat plain food, and I don't love kick&s;haws.</P>
<P>We have a &s;ingle lady, who will be gone in two or three days. She has one of the be&s;t apartments: That will then be at liberty.</P>
<P>You have one or two good ones mean time, I pre&s;ume, Madam, ju&s;t to receive my wife; for we have lo&s;t time&mdash;The&s;e damn'd phy&s;icians&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Madam, I am not u&s;ed to cur&s;e; but it is owing to the love I have for my wife&mdash;They have kept her in hand, till they are a&s;ham'd to take more fees, and now advi&s;e her to the air. I wi&s;h we had &s;ent her hither at fir&s;t. But we mu&s;t now make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">Excu&s;e me, Madam (for &s;he looked hard at me), that I am muffled up thus in this warm weather. I am but too &s;en&s;ible, that I have left my chamber &s;ooner than I ought, and perhaps &s;hall have a return of my gout for it. I came out thus muffled up, with a dreadful pain in my jaws; an ague in them, I believe. But my poor dear will not be &s;atisfied with any body's care but mine. And, as I told you, we have lo&s;t time.</P>
<P>You &s;hall &s;ee what accommodations I have, if you plea&s;e, Sir. But I doubt, you are too lame to walk up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I can make &s;hift to hobble up, now I have re&s;ted a little. I'll ju&s;t look upon the apartment my wife is to have. Any thing may do for the &s;ervants: And as you &s;eem to be a good &s;ort of gentlewoman, I &s;han't &s;tand for a price, and will pay well, be&s;ides, for the trouble I &s;hall give.</P>
<P>She led the way; and I, leaning upon the bani&s;ters, made &s;hift to get up with le&s;s fatigue than I expected from ancles &s;o weak. But oh! Jack, What was Sixtus the Vth's artful depre&s;&s;ion of his natural powers to mine, when, as the half-dead Montalto, he gaped for the pretendedly un&s;ought Pontificate, and, the mo|ment he was cho&s;en, leapt upon the prancing bea&s;t, which it was thought, by the amazed conclave, he was not able to mount without help of chairs and men? Never was there a more joyous heart and lighter heels than mine, joined together, yet both denied their functions; the one fluttering in &s;ecret, ready to bur&s;t its bars for relief-ful expre&s;&s;ion, the others obliged to an hobbling motion; when, unre&s;trained, they would, in their ma&s;ter's imagination, have mounted him to the lunar world, without the help of a ladder.</P>
<P>There were three rooms on a floor; two of them hand&s;ome; and the third, &s;he &s;aid, &s;till hand&s;omer; but the lady was in it.</P>
<P>I &s;aw!&mdash;I &s;aw, &s;he was! for as I hobbled up, cry|ing out upon my weak ancles, in the hoar&s;e mumbling
<PB N="15" REF="16">
voice I had a&s;&s;umed, I beheld a little piece of her, ju&s;t ca&s;ting an eye, with the door a-jar, as they call it, to ob&s;erve who was coming up; and, &s;eeing &s;uch an old clum&s;y fellow great-coated in weather &s;o warm, &s;louched, and muffled up, &s;he withdrew, &s;hutting the door without any emotion. But it was not &s;o with me; for thou can&s;t not imagine how my heart danced to my mouth, at the very glimp&s;e of her; &s;o that I was afraid the thump, thump, thump|ing villain, which had &s;o lately thumped as much to no purpo&s;e, would have choak'd me.</P>
<P>I liked the lodgings well; and the more, as &s;he &s;aid the third room was &s;till hand&s;omer. I mu&s;t &s;it down, Madam (and cho&s;e the darke&s;t part of the room): Won't you take a &s;eat your&s;elf? No price &s;hall part us. But I will leave the terms to you and my wife, if you plea&s;e: And al&s;o whether for board or not. Only plea&s;e to take This for earne&s;t, putting a guinea into her hand.&mdash;And one thing I will &s;ay; My poor wife loves money; but is not an ill-natured woman. She was a great fortune to me: But, as the real e&s;tate goes away at her death, I would fain pre|&s;erve her for that rea&s;on, as well as for the love I bear her, as an hone&s;t man. But if &s;he makes too clo&s;e a bargain with you, tell <HI>me</HI>; and, unknown to <HI>her,</HI> I will make it up. This is my con&s;tant way: She loves to have her pen'worths; and I would not have her vexed or made unea&s;y on any account.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, I was a very con&s;iderate gentleman; and, upon the condition I had mentioned, &s;he was content to leave the terms to my lady.</P>
<P>But, Madam, cannot a-body ju&s;t peep into the other apartment, that I may be more particular to my wi&s;e in the furniture of it?</P>
<P>The lady de&s;ires to be private, Sir&mdash;But&mdash;And was going to a&s;k her leave.</P>
<P>I caught hold of her hand&mdash;However, &s;tay, &s;tay,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Madam: It mayn't be proper, if the lady loves to be private. Don't let me intrude upon the lady&mdash;</P>
<P>No intru&s;ion, Sir, I dare &s;ay: The lady is good-humoured. She will be &s;o kind as to &s;tep down into the parlour, I dare &s;ay. As &s;he &s;tays &s;o little a while, I am &s;ure &s;he will not wi&s;h to &s;tand in my way.</P>
<P>No, Madam, that's true, if &s;he be good-humoured, as you &s;ay&mdash;Has &s;he been with you long, Madam?</P>
<P>But ye&s;terday, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe I ju&s;t now &s;aw the glimp&s;e of her. She &s;eems to be an elderly lady.</P>
<P>No, Sir; you're mi&s;taken. She's a young lady; and one of the hand&s;ome&s;t I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Cot &s;o, I beg her pardon! Not but that I &s;hould have liked her the better, were &s;he to &s;tay longer, if &s;he had been elderly. I have a &s;trange ta&s;te, Madam, you'll &s;ay, but I really, for my wife's &s;ake, love every elderly woman: Indeed I ever thought age was to be reverenced, which made me (taking the for|tune into the &s;cale too, <HI>that</HI> I own) make my addre&s;&s;es to my pre&s;ent dear.</P>
<P>Very good of you, Sir, to re&s;pect age: We all hope to live to be old.</P>
<P>Right, Madam. But you &s;ay the lady is beautiful. Now you mu&s;t know, that tho' I chu&s;e to conver&s;e with the elderly, yet I love to &s;ee a beautiful young woman, ju&s;t as I love to &s;ee fine flowers in a garden. There's no ca&s;ting an eye upon her, is there, without her notice? For in this dre&s;s, and thus muffled up about my jaws, I &s;hould not care to be &s;een, any more than &s;he, let her love privacy as much as &s;he will.</P>
<P>I will go a&s;k, if I may &s;hew a gentleman the apartment, Sir; and, as you are a married gentle|man, and not <HI>over</HI>-young, &s;he'll perhaps make the le&s;s &s;cruple.</P>
<P>Then, like me, &s;he loves elderly folks be&s;t, per|haps. But it may be &s;he has &s;uffered by young ones?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">I fancy &s;he has, Sir, or is afraid &s;he &s;hall. She de&s;ired to be very private, and if by de&s;cription in|quired after, to be denied.</P>
<P>Thou art true woman, goody Moore, thought I!</P>
<P>Good lack!&mdash;Good lack!&mdash;What may be her &s;tory then, I pray?</P>
<P>She is pretty re&s;erv'd in her &s;tory; but, to tell you my thoughts, I believe <HI>Love</HI> is in the ca&s;e: She is always in tears, and does not much care for company.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, it becomes not me to dive into ladies &s;ecrets; I want not to pry into other peoples affairs. But, pray, how does &s;he employ her&s;elf?&mdash;Yet &s;he came but ye&s;terday; &s;o you can't tell.</P>
<P>Writing continually, Sir.</P>
<P>The&s;e women, Jack, when you a&s;k them que|&s;tions by way of information, don't care to be igno|rant of any thing.</P>
<P>Nay, excu&s;e me, Madam, I am very far from be|ing an inqui&s;itive man. But if her ca&s;e be difficult, and not merely <HI>Love,</HI> as &s;he is a friend of yours, I would give her my advice.</P>
<P>Then you are a lawyer, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, indeed, Madam, I was &s;ome time at the Bar; but I have long left practice; yet am much con&s;ulted by my friends in difficult points. In a pauper ca&s;e I frequently <HI>give</HI> money; but never <HI>take</HI> any from the riche&s;t.</P>
<P>You are a very good gentleman, then, Sir.</P>
<P>Ay, Madam, we cannot live always here; and we ought to do what good we can&mdash;But I hate to appear officious. If the lady &s;tays any time, and thinks fit, upon better acquaintance, to let me in to her ca&s;e, it may be a happy day for her, if I find it a ju&s;t one; for, you mu&s;t know, that when I was at the Bar, I never was &s;uch a &s;ad fellow as to undertake, for the &s;ake of a paltry fee, to make white black, and black white; for what would that have been, but to en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by quirks, while I robbed the innocent?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">You are an excellent gentleman, Sir: I wi&s;h (and then &s;he &s;ighed) I had had the happine&s;s to know there was &s;uch a lawyer in the world; and to have been acquainted with him.</P>
<P>Come, come, Mrs. Moore, I think your name is, it may not be too late&mdash;When you and I are better acquainted, I may help <HI>you</HI> perhaps.&mdash;But mention nothing of this to the lady; for, as I &s;aid, I hate to appear officious.</P>
<P>This prohibition, I knew, if goody Moore an&s;wer'd the &s;pecimen &s;he had given of her womanhood, would make her take the fir&s;t opportunity to tell, were it to be nece&s;&s;ary to my purpo&s;e that &s;he &s;hould.</P>
<P>I appeared, upon the whole, &s;o indifferent about &s;eeing the room, or the lady, that the good woman was the more eager I &s;hould &s;ee both. And the rather, as I, to &s;timulate her, declared, that there was more required in my eye to merit the character of a hand|&s;ome woman, than mo&s;t people thought nece&s;&s;ary; and that I had never &s;een &s;ix truly lovely ladies in my life.</P>
<P>To be brief, &s;he went in; and after a little while came out again. The lady, Sir, is retired to her clo&s;et, &s;o you may go in and look at the room.</P>
<P>Then how my heart began again to play its pug's tricks!</P>
<P>I hobbled in, and &s;tump'd about, and liked it very much; and was &s;ure my wife would. I begg'd ex|cu&s;e for &s;itting down, and a&s;k'd, Who was the mini|&s;ter of the place? If he were a good preacher? Who preached at the chapel? And if <HI>he</HI> were a good preacher, and good <HI>liver</HI> too, Madam&mdash;I mu&s;t inquire after <HI>That:</HI> For I love, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that the Clergy &s;hould practi&s;e what they preach.</P>
<P>Very right, Sir; but that is not &s;o often the ca&s;e, as were to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>More's the pity, Madam. But I have a great veneration for the Clergy in general. It is more a &s;atire upon Human nature, than upon the Cloth, if
<PB N="19" REF="20">
we &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e who have the <HI>be&s;t</HI> opportunities to be good, le&s;s perfect than other people. For my part, I don't love <HI>profe&s;&s;ional</HI> any more than <HI>national</HI> re|flections.&mdash;But I keep the lady in her clo&s;et. My gout makes me rude.</P>
<P>Then up from my &s;eat &s;tumped I&mdash;What do you call the&s;e window-curtains, Madam?</P>
<P>Stuff-dama&s;k, Sir.</P>
<P>It looks mighty well, truly. I like it better than &s;ilk. It is warmer to be &s;ure, and much fitter for lodgings in the country; e&s;pecially for people in years. The bed is in a pretty ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is neat and clean, Sir: That's all we pretend to.</P>
<P>Ay, mighty well&mdash;Very well&mdash;A &s;ilk camlet, I think&mdash;Very well, truly!&mdash;I am &s;ure my wife will like it. But we would not turn the lady out of her lodging for the world. The other two apartments will do for us at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Then &s;tumping towards the clo&s;et, over the door of which hung a picture&mdash;What picture is that?&mdash; Oh! I &s;ee: A St. Caecilia!</P>
<P>A common print, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Pretty well, pretty well! It is after an Italian ma|&s;ter.&mdash;I would not for the world turn the lady out of her apartment. We can make &s;hift with the other two, repeated I, louder &s;till: But yet mumblingly hoar&s;e; for I had as great regard to uniformity in accent, as to my words.</P>
<P>O Belford! to be &s;o near my angel, think what a painful con&s;traint I was under!&mdash;</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved to fetch her out, if po&s;&s;ible: And pretending to be going&mdash;You can't agree as to any <HI>time,</HI> Mrs. Moore, when we can have this third room, can you?&mdash;Not that (whi&s;per'd I, loud enough to be heard in the next room; Not that) I would in|commode the lady: But I would tell my wife <HI>when</HI>-abouts&mdash;And women, you know, Mrs. Moore, love to have every thing before them of this nature.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">Mrs. Moore, &s;ays my charmer [and never did her voice &s;ound &s;o harmonious to me: Oh how my heart bounded again! It even talked to me, in a manner; for I thought I <HI>heard,</HI> as well as <HI>felt,</HI> its un|ruly flutters; and every vein about me &s;eemed a pul&s;e: Mrs. Moore], you may acquaint the gentle|man, that I &s;hall &s;tay here only for two or three days, at mo&s;t, till I receive an an&s;wer to a letter I have written into the country; and rather than be your hindrance, I will take up with any apartment a pair of &s;tairs higher.</P>
<P>Not for the world! Not for the world, young lady, cried I!&mdash;My wife, well as I love her, &s;hould lie in a garret, rather than put &s;uch a con&s;iderate lady, as you &s;eem to be, to the lea&s;t inconvenien-cy.</P>
<P>She opened not the door yet; and I &s;aid, But &s;ince you have &s;o much goodne&s;s, Madam, if I could but ju&s;t look into the clo&s;et, as I &s;tand, I could tell my wife, whether it is large enough to hold a cabinet &s;he much values, and will have with her where-ever &s;he goes.</P>
<P>Then my charmer opened the door, and blazed upon me, as it were, in a flood of light, like what one might imagine would &s;trike a man, who, born blind, had by &s;ome propitious power been ble&s;&s;ed with his &s;ight, all at once, in a meridian &s;un.</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul, I never was &s;o &s;trangely affected before. I had much ado to forbear di&s;covering my|&s;elf that in&s;tant: But, he&s;itatingly, and in great di&s;|order, I &s;aid, looking into the clo&s;et, and around it, There is room, I &s;ee, for my wife's cabinet; and it has many jewels in it of high price; but, upon my &s;oul (for I could not forbear &s;wearing, like a puppy: &mdash;Habit is a cur&s;ed thing, Jack&mdash;) Nothing &s;o valuable as the lady I &s;ee, can be brought into it!&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;tarted, and looked at me with terror. The truth of the compliment, as far as I know, had taken di&s;&s;imulation from my accent.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">I &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal my&s;elf longer from her, any more than (from the violent impul&s;es of my pa&s;&s;ion) to forbear manife&s;ting my&s;elf. I un|buttoned therefore my cape, I pulled off my flapt, &s;louched hat; I threw open my great coat, and, like the devil in Milton (an odd compari&s;on tho'!),
<Q><L>I &s;tarted up in my own form divine,</L>
<L>Touch'd by the beam of her cele&s;tial eye,</L>
<L>More potent than Ithuriel's &s;pear!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, Belford, for a &s;imilitude&mdash;Now for a like|ne&s;s to illu&s;trate the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene, and the effect it had upon my charmer, and the gentlewoman!&mdash;But nothing <HI>was</HI> like it, or equal to it. The plain fact can only de&s;cribe it, and &s;et it off. Thus then take it.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner &s;aw who it was, than &s;he gave three violent &s;creams; and, before I could catch her in my arms (as I was about to do the moment I di&s;cover'd my&s;elf), down &s;he &s;unk at my feet, in a fit; which made me cur&s;e my indi&s;cretion for &s;o &s;uddenly, and with &s;o much emotion, revealing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The gentlewoman, &s;eeing &s;o &s;trange an alteration in my per&s;on, and features, and voice, and dre&s;s, cried out, Murder, help! Murder, help! by turns, for half a dozen times running. This alarmed the hou&s;e, and up ran two &s;ervant maids, and <HI>my</HI> &s;ervant after them. I cried out for water and hart&s;horn, and every one flew a different way, one of the maids as fa&s;t down as &s;he came up; while the gentlewoman ran out of one room into another, and by turns up and down the apartment we were in, without mean|ing or end, wringing her fooli&s;h hands, and not knowing what &s;he did.</P>
<P>Up then came running a gentleman and his &s;i&s;ter, fetched, and brought in by the maid who had run down; and who having let in a cur&s;ed crabbed old wretch, hobbling with his gout, and mumbling with his hoar&s;e broken-toothed voice, was metamorpho&s;ed all at
<PB N="22" REF="23">
once into a lively gay young fellow, with a clear accent, and all his teeth; and &s;he would have it, that I was neither more nor le&s;s than the devil, and could not keep her eye from my foot; expecting, no doubt, every minute to &s;ee it di&s;cover it&s;elf to be cloven.</P>
<P>For my part, I was &s;o intent upon re&s;toring my angel, that I regarded nobody el&s;e. And at la&s;t, &s;he &s;lowly recovering motion, with bitter &s;ighs and &s;obs (only the whites of her eyes however appearing for &s;ome moments), I called upon her in the tendere&s;t accent, as I kneeled by her, my arm &s;upporting her head; My angel! My charmer! My Clari&s;&s;a! look upon me, my deare&s;t life!&mdash;I am not angry with you! &mdash;I will forgive you, my be&s;t beloved!&mdash;</P>
<P>The gentleman and his &s;i&s;ter knew not what to make of all this: And the le&s;s, when my fair one, recovering her &s;ight, &s;natched another look at me; and then again groaned, and fainted away.</P>
<P>I threw up the clo&s;et-&s;a&s;h for air, and then left her to the care of the young gentlewoman, the &s;ame notable Mi&s;s Rawlins, whom I had heard of at the Fla&s;k; and to that of Mrs. Moore; who by this time had recover'd her&s;elf; and then retiring to one corner of the room, I made my &s;ervant pull off my gouty &s;tockens, bru&s;h my hat, and loop it up into the u&s;ual &s;mart cock.</P>
<P>I then &s;tept to the clo&s;et to Mr. Rawlins, whom, in the general confu&s;ion, I had not much minded before. &mdash;Sir, &s;aid I, you have an uncommon &s;cene before you. The lady is my wife, and no gentleman's pre|&s;ence is nece&s;&s;ary here but my own.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Sir: <HI>If</HI> the lady is your wife, I have no bu&s;ine&s;s here. <HI>But,</HI> Sir, by her concern at &s;ee|ing you&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, none of your <HI>if's,</HI> and <HI>but's,</HI> I be&s;eech you: Nor <HI>your</HI> concern about the <HI>lady</HI>'s concern. You are a very unqualified judge in this cau&s;e; and I beg of you, Sir, to oblige me with your ab&s;ence.
<PB N="23" REF="24">
The ladies only are proper to be pre&s;ent on this occa|&s;ion, added I; and I think my&s;elf obliged to them for their care and kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>'Tis well he made not another word: For I found my choler begin to ri&s;e. I could not bear, that the fine&s;t neck, and arms, and foot, in the world, &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the eyes of any man living but mine.</P>
<P>I withdrew once more from the clo&s;et, finding her beginning to recover, le&s;t the &s;ight of me too &s;oon, &s;hould throw her back again.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t words &s;he &s;aid, looking round her with great emotion, were, O hide me! Hide me! Is he gone!&mdash;O hide me! Is he gone!</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Rawlins, coming to me with an air &s;omewhat peremptory and a&s;&s;ured, This is &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;ing ca&s;e. The lady cannot bear the &s;ight of you. What you have done, is be&s;t known to your&s;elf. But another &s;uch fit will probably be her la&s;t. It would be but kind, therefore, for you to retire.</P>
<P>It behov'd me to have &s;o notable a per&s;on of my party; and the rather, as I had di&s;obliged her imper|tinent brother.</P>
<P>The dear creature, &s;aid I, may <HI>well</HI> be concerned to &s;ee me. If <HI>you,</HI> Madam, had a hu&s;band who loved you, as I love her, you would not, I am confident, fly from him, and expo&s;e your&s;elf to hazards, as &s;he does whenever &s;he has not all her way&mdash;And yet with a mind not capable of intentional evil&mdash;But, mother-&s;poilt! This is her fault, and All her fault: And the more inexcu&s;able it is, as I am the man of her choice, and have rea&s;on to think &s;he loves me above all the men in the world.</P>
<P>Here, Jack, was a &s;tory to &s;upport to the lady; face to face too <NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="foot"><P>And here, Belford, le&s;t thou, thro' inattention, &s;hould&s;t be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at my a&s;&s;urance, let me remind thee (and that, thus, by way of marginal ob&s;ervation, that I may not break in upon my narrative), that this my intrepidity was but a con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures I had previou&s;ly concerted (as I have from time to time acquainted thee) in apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch an event as has fallen out. For had not the dear creature already pa&s;&s;ed for my wife, before no le&s;s than four worthy gentleman of family and fortune <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 321.</NOTE>? And before Mrs. Sinclair, and her hou&s;hold, and Mi&s;s Partington?&mdash; And had &s;he not agreed to her uncle's expedient, that &s;he <HI>&s;hould</HI> pa&s;s for &s;uch, from the time of Mr. Hickman's application to that uncle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 262.</NOTE>; and that the worthy captain Tomlin&s;on &s;hould be allowed to propagate that belief; as he had actually reported it to two families <HI>(they po&s;&s;ibly to more)</HI>; purpo&s;ely that it might come to the ears of James Harl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">we; and &s;erve for a foundation for uncle John to build his reconciliation-&s;cheme upon <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 264.</NOTE>? And can&s;t thou think, that nothing was meant by all this contrivance? And that I am not &s;till <HI>further</HI> prepared to &s;upport my &s;tory?</P>
<P>Indeed, I little thought, at the time that I formed the&s;e precautionary &s;chemes, that &s;he would ever have been able <HI>if willing,</HI> to get out of my hands. All that I hoped I &s;hould have occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to them for, was only, that in ca&s;e I &s;hould have the courage to make the grand attempt, and &s;hould &s;ucceed in it, to bring the dear creature (and this out of tenderne&s;s to her; for what attention did I ever yet pay to the grief, the execiations, the tears of a woman I had triumphed over?) to bear me in her &s;ight; to expo&s;tulate with me; to be pacified by my pleas, and by her own future hopes, founded upon the reconciliatory-project, upon my reiterated vows, and upon the captain's a&s;&s;urances&mdash; Since, in that ca&s;e, to forgive me, to have gone on with me for a week, would have been to forgive me, to have gone on with me, for ever. And then had my eligible life of honour taken place; her trials would all have been then ever; and &s;he would have known nothing but gratitude, love, and joy, to the end of one of our lives. For never would I, never could I, have abandoned &s;uch an admirable creature as this. Thou knowe&s;t, I never was a &s;ordid villain to any of her inferiors&mdash; Her <HI>inferiors,</HI> I may &s;ay,&mdash;For, who is not her inferior?</P></NOTE>!</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">You <HI>&s;peak</HI> like a gentleman; you <HI>look</HI> like a gentle|man, &s;aid Mi&s;s Rawlins&mdash;But, Sir, this is a &s;trange ca&s;e; the lady &s;eems to dread the &s;ight of you.</P>
<P>No wonder, Madam; taking her a little on one &s;ide, nearer to Mrs. Moore. I have three times already forgiven the dear creature.&mdash;But this <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> &mdash;There is a &s;pice of <HI>that</HI> in it&mdash;and of <HI>phren&s;y</HI> too (whi&s;pered I, that it might have the face of a &s;ecret, and, of con&s;equence, the more engage their attention) &mdash;But our &s;tory is too long&mdash;</P>
<P>I then made a motion to go to the lady. But they de&s;ired, that I would walk into the next room; and they would endeavour to prevail upon her to lie down.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">I begg'd that they would not &s;uffer her to talk; for that &s;he was accu&s;tomed to fits, and would, when in this way, talk of any thing that came uppermo&s;t; and the more &s;he was &s;uffered to run on, the wor&s;e &s;he was; and if not kept quiet, would fall into rave|ings; which might po&s;&s;ibly hold her a week.</P>
<P>They promi&s;ed to keep her quiet; and I withdrew into the next room; ordering every one down but Mrs. Moore and Mi&s;s Rawlins.</P>
<P>She was full of exclamations. Unhappy creature! mi&s;erable! ruined! and undone! &s;he called her&s;elf; wrung her hands, and begged they would a&s;&s;i&s;t her to e&s;cape from the terrible evils &s;he &s;hould otherwi&s;e be made to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>They preached patience and quietne&s;s to her; and would have had her to lie down; but &s;he refu&s;ed; &s;inking, however, into an ea&s;y chair; for &s;he trem|bled &s;o, &s;he could not &s;tand.</P>
<P>By this time, I hoped that &s;he was enough re|cover'd to bear a pre&s;ence, that it behoved me to make her bear; and fearing &s;he would throw out &s;omething in her exclamations, that would &s;till more di&s;concert me, I went into the room again.</P>
<P>O! there he is! &s;aid &s;he, and threw her apron over her face&mdash;I cannot &s;ee him!&mdash;I cannot look upon him! &mdash;Begone! begone! touch me not!&mdash;</P>
<P>For I took her &s;truggling hand, be&s;eeching her to be pacified; and a&s;&s;uring her, that I would make all up with her, upon her own terms and wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Ba&s;e man! &s;aid the violent lady, I have no wi&s;hes, but never to behold you more! Why mu&s;t I be thus pur&s;ued and haunted? Have you not made me mi&s;erable enough already? De&s;poiled of all &s;uccour and help, and of every friend, I am contented to be poor, low, and mi&s;erable, &s;o I may be free from your per&s;ecutions!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">Mi&s;s Rawlins &s;tared at me [A confident &s;lut this Mi&s;s Rawlins, thought I!] So did Mrs. Moore&mdash;I told you &s;o! whi&s;peringly &s;aid I, turning to the women; &s;haking my head with a face of great con|cern and pity; and then to my charmer, My dear creature, how you rave!&mdash;You will not ea&s;ily re|cover from the effects of this violence! Have pa|tience, my love! Be pacified! and we will coolly talk this matter over: For you expo&s;e your&s;elf, as well as me: The&s;e ladies will certainly think, you have fallen among robbers; and that I am the chief of them.</P>
<P>So you are! &s;o you are! &s;tamping, her face &s;till covered [She thought of Wedne&s;day night, no doubt]; and, &s;ighing as if her heart were breaking, &s;he put her hand to her forehead&mdash;I &s;hall be quite di&s;tracted!</P>
<P>I will not, my deare&s;t love, uncover your face. You &s;hall <HI>not</HI> look upon me, &s;ince I am &s;o odious to you. But this is a violence I never thought you capable of.&mdash;</P>
<P>And I would have pre&s;&s;ed her hand, as I held it, with my lips; but &s;he drew it from me with indignation.</P>
<P>Unhand me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. I will not be touched by you. Leave me to my fate. What right, what title, have you to per&s;ecute me thus?</P>
<P>What right, what title, my dear!&mdash;But this is not a time&mdash;I have a letter from Captain Tomlin&s;on&mdash; Here it is&mdash;offering it to her&mdash;</P>
<P>I will receive nothing from your hands&mdash;Tell me not of Captain Tomlin&s;on&mdash;Tell me not of any|body&mdash;You have no right to invade me thus&mdash;Once more, leave me to my fate&mdash;Have you not made me mi&s;erable enough?&mdash;</P>
<P>I touched a delicate &s;tring, on purpo&s;e to &s;et her in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion before the women, as might confirm the intimation I had given of a phren&s;ical di&s;order.</P>
<P>What a turn is here!&mdash;Lately &s;o happy!&mdash;Nothing wanting but a reconciliation between you and your
<PB N="27" REF="28">
friends!&mdash;That reconciliation in &s;uch a happy train!&mdash; Shall &s;o <HI>&s;light,</HI> &s;o <HI>accidental</HI> an occa&s;ion be &s;uffered to overturn all our happine&s;s?</P>
<P>She &s;tarted up with a trembling impatience, her apron falling from her indignant face&mdash;Now, &s;aid &s;he, that thou dare&s;t to call the occa&s;ion <HI>&s;light</HI> and <HI>accidental,</HI> and that I am happily out of thy vile hands, and out of a hou&s;e I have rea&s;on to believe <HI>as</HI> vile, traitor and wretch that thou art, I will venture to ca&s;t an eye upon thee&mdash;And O that it were in my power, in mercy to my &s;ex, to look thee fir&s;t into &s;hame and remor&s;e, and then into death!</P>
<P>This violent tragedy-&s;peech, and the high manner in which &s;he uttered it, had its de&s;ired effect. I looked upon the women, and upon her, by turns, with a pitying eye; and they &s;hook their wi&s;e heads, and be|&s;ought <HI>me</HI> to retire, and <HI>her</HI> to lie down to compo&s;e her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This hurricane, like other hurricanes, was pre&s;ently allayed by a &s;hower. She threw her&s;elf once more in|to her armed chair&mdash;And begg'd pardon of the women for her pa&s;&s;ionate exce&s;s; but not of me: Yet I was in hopes, that when compliments were &s;tirring, I &s;hould have come in for a &s;hare.</P>
<P>Indeed, ladies, &s;aid I (with a&s;&s;urance enough, thou'lt &s;ay), this violence is not natural to my beloved's temper&mdash;Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, wretch!&mdash;And want I excu&s;es from thee!</P>
<P>What a &s;corn was every lovely feature agitated by!</P>
<P>Then turning her face from me, I have not pa|tience, O thou guileful betrayer, to look upon thee! &mdash;Begone! Begone! With a face &s;o unblu&s;hing, how dare&s;t thou my pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>I thought then, that the character of a hu&s;band obliged me to be angry.</P>
<P>You may one day, Madam, repent this treatment:
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&mdash;By my &s;oul you may.&mdash;You know I have not de|&s;erved it of you&mdash;You <HI>know</HI> I have not.</P>
<P>Do I know you have not? &mdash;Wretch! Do I know&mdash;</P>
<P>You do, Madam!&mdash;And never did man of my figure and con&s;ideration [I thought it was proper to throw that in] meet with &s;uch treatment. [She lifted up her hands: Indignation kept her &s;ilent.]&mdash;But all is of a piece with the charge you bring again&s;t me of <HI>de&s;poiling you of all &s;uccour and help,</HI> of making you <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>low,</HI> and with other unprecedented language. I will only &s;ay, before the&s;e two gentlewomen, that &s;ince it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o, and &s;ince your former e&s;teem for me is turned into &s;o riveted an aver&s;ion, I will &s;oon, <HI>very</HI> &s;oon, make you intirely ea&s;y.

<P>Send it to this place; and a&s;&s;ure me, that you will never mole&s;t me more; never more come near me; and that is all I a&s;k of you.</P>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> do &s;o, Madam, &s;aid I, with a dejected air. But did I ever think I &s;hould be &s;o indifferent to you? &mdash;However, you mu&s;t permit me to in&s;i&s;t on your reading this letter; and on your &s;eeing Captain Tom|lin&s;on, and hearing what he has to &s;ay from your uncle. He will be here by-and-by.</P>
<P>Don't trifle with me, &s;aid &s;he, in an imperious tone&mdash;Do as you offer. I will not receive any letter from your hands. If I &s;ee Captain Tomlin&s;on, it &s;hall be on his <HI>own</HI> account; not on <HI>yours.</HI> You tell me you will &s;end me my apparel: If you would have me believe any thing you &s;ay, let This be the te&s;t of your &s;incerity&mdash;Leave me <HI>now,</HI> and &s;end my things.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">The women &s;tared. They did nothing but &s;tare; and appeared to be more and more at a lo&s;s what to make of the matter between us.</P>
<P>I pretended to be going from her in a pet: But when I had got to the door, I turned back; and, as if I had recollected my&s;elf, One word more, my deare&s;t creature!&mdash;Charming even in your anger!&mdash;O my fond &s;oul! &s;aid I, turning half round, and pulling out my handkerchief.</P>
<P>I believe, Jack, my eyes did gli&s;ten a little&mdash;I have no doubt but they did.&mdash;The women pitied me. Hone&s;t &s;ouls!&mdash;They &s;hew'd, that they had each of them a handkerchief as well as I. So, ha&s;t thou not ob&s;erved (to give a familiar illu&s;tration) every man in a company of a dozen, or more, obligingly pull out his watch, when &s;ome one has a&s;ked, What's o'clock?</P>
<P>One word only, Madam, repeated I, as &s;oon as my voice had recovered its tone&mdash;I have repre&s;ented to Captain Tomlin&s;on in the mo&s;t favourable light the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent mi&s;under&s;tanding. You know what your uncle in&s;i&s;ts upon; and which you have acquie&s;ced with. The letter in my hand [and again I offered it to her] will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from your brother's active malice.</P>
<P>She was going to &s;peak in a high accent, putting the letter from her, with an open palm&mdash;Nay, hear me out, Madam&mdash;The Captain, you know, has re|ported our <HI>marriage</HI> to two different per&s;ons. It is come to your brother's ears. My own relations have al&s;o heard of it. Letters were brought me from town this morning, from Lady Betty Lawrance and Mi&s;s Montague. Here they are [I pulled them out of my pocket, and offered them to her, with That of the Captain; but &s;he held back her &s;till open palm, that &s;he might not receive them]: Reflect, Madam, I be&s;eech you reflect, upon the fatal con&s;equences
<PB N="30" REF="31">
which this your high re&s;entment may be attended with.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I knew you, &s;aid &s;he, I have been in a wilderne&s;s of doubt and error. I ble&s;s God that I am out of your hands. I will tran&s;act for my&s;elf what relates to my&s;elf. I di&s;mi&s;s all your &s;olicitude for me. Am I not my own mi&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;Am I not&mdash;</P>
<P>The women &s;tared [The devil &s;tare ye, thought I, can ye do nothing but &s;tare?]. It was high time to &s;top her here. I rai&s;ed my voice to drown hers&mdash; You u&s;ed, my deare&s;t creature, to have a tender and apprehen&s;ive heart&mdash;You never had &s;o much rea&s;on for &s;uch a one as now.</P>
<P>Let me judge for my&s;elf, upon what I &s;hall <HI>&s;ee,</HI> not upon what I &s;hall <HI>hear</HI>&mdash;Do you think I &s;hall ever&mdash;</P>
<P>I dreaded her going on&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be heard, Madam, rai&s;ing my voice &s;till higher. You mu&s;t let me read one paragraph or two of This letter to you, if you will not read it your&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>Begone from me, Man!&mdash;Begone from me with thy Letters! What pretence ha&s;t thou for tormenting me thus&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t creature, what que&s;tions you a&s;k! Que|&s;tions that you can as well an&s;wer your&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>I <HI>can,</HI> I <HI>will</HI>&mdash;And <HI>thus</HI> I an&s;wer them&mdash;</P>
<P>Still louder rai&s;ed I my voice. She was overborne. Sweet &s;oul! It would be hard, thought I [and yet I was very angry with her], if &s;uch a &s;pirit as thine cannot be brought to yield to &s;uch a one as mine!</P>
<P>I lowered my voice on her &s;ilence. All gentle, all <HI>intreative,</HI> my accent: My head bowed; one hand held out; the other on my hone&s;t heart:&mdash;For heaven's &s;ake, my deare&s;t creature, re&s;olve to &s;ee Captain Tomlin&s;on with temper. He would have come along with me: But I was willing to try to &s;often your mind fir&s;t, on this fatal mi&s;apprehen&s;ion; and This for the &s;ake of your own wi&s;hes: For what is it otherwi&s;e to me, whether your friends, are, or

Lady Betty will not let you re&s;t till you con&s;ent to accompany her to her own &s;eat&mdash;And to that lady may you &s;afely intru&s;t your cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, upon my pau&s;ing a moment, &s;he was go|ing to break out. I liked not the turn of her coun|tenance, nor the tone of her voice&mdash;
<Q>And thinke&s;t thou, ba&s;e wretch,</Q>
were the words &s;he <HI>did</HI> utter.
I again rai&s;ed my voice, and drowned hers&mdash;<HI>Ba&s;e wretch,</HI> Madam!&mdash;You know, that I have not de|&s;erved the violent names you have called me.

that it is nece&s;&s;ary, that you &s;hould come into better temper with me, were it but to give a favourable ap|pearance to what <HI>has pa&s;&s;ed,</HI> and weight to any <HI>future application</HI> to your friends, in whatever way you &s;hall think proper to make it.</P>
<P>I then put the letters into her lap, and retired into the next apartment with a low bow, and a very &s;olemn air.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon followed by the two women. Mrs. Moore withdrew to give the fair Perver&s;e time to read them: Mi&s;s Rawlins for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and becau&s;e &s;he was &s;ent for home.</P>
<P>The widow be&s;ought her &s;peedy return. I joined in the &s;ame reque&s;t; and &s;he was ready enough to promi&s;e to oblige us.</P>
<P>I excu&s;ed my&s;elf to Mrs. Moore for the di&s;gui&s;e I had appeared in at fir&s;t, and for the &s;tory I had in|vented. I told her, that I held my&s;elf obliged to &s;atisfy her for the whole floor we were upon; and for an up|per room for my &s;ervant; and that for a month certain.</P>
<P>She made many &s;cruples, and begg'd &s;he might not be urged on this head, till &s;he had con&s;ulted Mi&s;s Rawlins.</P>
<P>I con&s;ented; but told her, that &s;he had taken my earne&s;t; and I hoped there was no room for di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mi&s;s Rawlins return'd, with an air of eager curio&s;ity; and having been told, what had pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Moore and me, &s;he gave her&s;elf airs of office immediately: Which I humoured, plainly per|ceiving, that if I had <HI>her</HI> with me, I had the other.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed, if there were time for it, and if it were not quite impertinent in her to de&s;ire it, that I would give Mrs. Moore and her a brief hi&s;tory of an affair, which, as &s;he &s;aid, bore the face of novelty, my&s;tery, and &s;urprize: For &s;ometimes it looked to her as if we were married; at other times, that point appeared doubtful; and yet the lady did not ab&s;olutely deny
<PB N="33" REF="34">
it; but, upon the whole, thought her&s;elf highly injured.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, That ours was a very particular ca&s;e: That were I to acquaint them with it, &s;ome part of it would hardly appear credible. But, however, I would give them, as they &s;eemed to be per&s;ons of di&s;cretion, a brief account of the whole; and this in &s;o plain and &s;incere a manner, that it &s;hould clear up to their &s;atisfaction every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, or might hereafter pa&s;s between us.</P>
<P>They &s;at down by me, and threw every feature of their faces into attention. I was re&s;olved to go as near the truth as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t any thing &s;hould drop from my &s;pou&s;e to impeach my veracity; and yet keep in view what pa&s;&s;ed at the Fla&s;k.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, altho' thou knowe&s;t my whole &s;tory, and a good deal of my views, that thou &s;hould&s;t be apprized of the &s;ub&s;tance of what I told them.</P>
<P><Q>I gave them, in as conci&s;e a manner as I was able, the hi&s;tory of our families, fortunes, alliances, an|tipathies (her brother's, and mine, particularly). I averred the truth of our private marriage.</Q>
The Captain's letter, which I will inclo&s;e, will give thee my rea&s;ons for that: And be&s;ides, the women might al&s;o, perhaps, have propo&s;ed a par&s;on to me by way of compromi&s;e.
<Q>I told them the condition my &s;pou&s;e had made me &s;wear to; and which &s;he held me to, in order, I &s;aid, to induce me the &s;ooner to be re|conciled to her relations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I owned, that this re&s;traint made me &s;ometimes ready to fly out.</Q>
And Mrs. Moore was &s;o good as to declare, that &s;he did not much wonder at it.</P>
<P>Thou art a very good &s;ort of woman, Mrs. Moore, thought I.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Howe has actually detected our mother; and might po&s;&s;ibly find &s;ome way &s;till to acquaint her friend with her di&s;coveries; I thought it proper to

prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them in Mrs. Sinclair's favour; and in that of her two nieces.</P>
<P>I &s;aid,
<Q>They were gentlewomen born; had not bad hearts; that indeed my &s;pou&s;e did not love them; they having once jointly taken the liberty to blame her for her over-nicene&s;s with regard to me. People, I &s;aid, even <HI>good</HI> people, who knew them|&s;elves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend, were too often lea&s;t patient, when told of it; as they could le&s;s bear than others, to be thought indifferently of.</Q></P>
<P>Too often the ca&s;e, they owned.</P>
<P><Q>Mrs. Sinclair's hou&s;e was a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e, and fit to receive the fir&s;t quality [True enough, Jack!]: Mrs. Sinclair was a woman very ea&s;y in her circum&s;tances: A widow-gentlewoman&mdash;as <HI>you,</HI> Mrs. Moore, are. Lets lodgings&mdash;as <HI>you,</HI> Mrs. Moore, do. Once had better pro&s;pects&mdash;as <HI>you,</HI> Mrs. Moore, may have had: The relict of Colonel Sinclair: You, Mrs. Moore, might know Colonel Sinclair&mdash;He had lodgings at Ham&s;tead.</Q></P>
<P>She had heard of the name.</P>
<P><Q>O, he was related to the be&s;t families in Scot|land: And his widow is not to be reflected upon, becau&s;e &s;he lets lodgings, you know Mrs. Moore; &mdash;You know, Mi&s;s Rawlins.</Q></P>
<P>Very true, and, Very true: And they mu&s;t needs &s;ay, it did not look quite &s;o pretty in &s;uch a lady as my &s;pou&s;e, to be &s;o cen&s;orious.</P>
<P>A foundation here, thought I, to procure the&s;e womens help to get back the fugitive, or their con|nivance at lea&s;t at my doing &s;o; as well as for anticipa|ting any future information from Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>I gave them a character of that virago: And in|tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated,
<Q>that for a head to contrive mi&s;chief, and a heart to execute it, &s;he had hardly her equal in her &s;ex.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">To <HI>this</HI> Mi&s;s Howe it was, Mrs. Moore &s;aid, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, that my &s;pou&s;e was &s;o de&s;irous to di&s;patch a man and hor&s;e, by day-dawn, with a letter &s;he wrote before &s;he went to bed la&s;t night; propo&s;ing to &s;tay no longer than till &s;he had received an an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame, &s;aid I. I <HI>knew</HI> &s;he would have immediate recour&s;e to her. I &s;hould have been but too happy, could I have prevented &s;uch a letter from pa&s;&s;ing, or &s;o to have managed, as to have it given into Mrs. Howe's hands, in&s;tead of her daughter's. Women who had lived &s;ome time in the world, knew <HI>better,</HI> than to encourage &s;uch &s;kitti&s;h pranks in young wives.</P>
<P>Let me ju&s;t &s;top to tell thee, while it is in my head, that I have &s;ince given Will. his cue to find out where the man lives who is gone with the fair fugitive's letter; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ee him on his return, before he &s;ees her.</P>
<P>I told the women,
<Q>That I de&s;paired it would ever be better with us, while Mi&s;s Howe had &s;o &s;trange a predominance over my &s;pou&s;e, and re|mained her&s;elf <HI>unmarried</HI>; and until the reconcili|ation with her friends could be effected; or a <HI>&s;till</HI> happier event,&mdash;as I &s;hould think it, who am the la&s;t male of my family; and which my fooli&s;h vow, and her rigour, had hitherto&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Here I &s;topt, and looked mode&s;t, turning my diamond ring round my finger: While goody Moore looked mighty &s;ignificant, calling it a very particular ca&s;e; and the maiden lady fann'd away, and primm'd and purs'd, to &s;hew, that what I &s;aid needed no far|ther explanation.</P>
<P><Q>I told them the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent differ|ence: Avowed the reality of the fire: But owned, that I would have made no &s;cruple of breaking the unnatural oath &s;he had bound me in (having an hu&s;band's right of my &s;ide), when &s;he was &s;o acci|dentally frighted into my arms: And I blamed my|&s;elf
<PB N="36" REF="37">
exce&s;&s;ively, that I did not; &s;ince &s;he thought fit to carry her re&s;entment &s;o high, and had the inju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e the fire to be a contrivance of mine.</Q></P>
<P>Nay, for that matter, Mrs. Moore &s;aid&mdash;as we were married, and <HI>Madam</HI> was &s;o odd&mdash;Every gentle|man would not&mdash;And there &s;topt Mrs. Moore.</P>
<P><Q>To &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have recour&s;e to &s;uch a <HI>poor</HI> contrivance, &s;aid I, when I &s;aw the dear creature <HI>every hour</HI>&mdash;</Q>
Was not this a bold put, Jack?</P>
<P>A mo&s;t extraordinary ca&s;e, truly! the maiden lady: Fanning, yet coming in with her <HI>Well-buts,</HI> and her &s;ifting <HI>Pray-Sir's!</HI>&mdash; And her re&s;training <HI>Enough-Sir's!</HI>&mdash;flying <HI>from</HI> the que&s;tion <HI>to</HI> the que|&s;tion; her &s;eat now-and-then unea&s;y, for fear my want of delicacy &s;hould hurt her abundant mode&s;ty; and yet it was difficult to &s;atisfy her <HI>&s;uper</HI>-abundant curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><Q>My beloved's jealou&s;y; which of it&s;elf, to female minds, accounts for a thou&s;and unaccountablene&s;&s;es; and the imputation of her half-phren&s;y brought upon her by her father's wicked cur&s;e, and by the previous per&s;ecutions &s;he had undergone from all her family; were what I dwelt upon, in order to provide again&s;t what might happen.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort,
<Q>I owned again&s;t my&s;elf mo&s;t of the offences which I did not doubt but &s;he would charge me with in their hearing: And as every cau&s;e has a black and a white &s;ide, I gave the wor&s;t parts of our &s;tory the gentle&s;t turn. And when I had done, gave them &s;ome <HI>partial</HI> hints of the contents of Cap|tain Tomlin&s;on's letter, which I had left with her: With a caution, to be guarded again&s;t the inquiries of James Harlowe, and of Captain Singleton, or of any &s;ailor-looking men.</Q>
This thou wilt &s;ee from the letter it&s;elf was nece&s;&s;ary to be done. Here therefore thou maye&s;t read it. And a charming letter to my purpo&s;e, if thou give&s;t the lea&s;t attention to its contents, wilt thou find it to be.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. June</HI> 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I am obliged to be in town to-morrow, or next day at farthe&s;t, yet I would not di&s;pen&s;e with writing to you, by one of my &s;ervants, (whom I &s;end up before me upon a particular occa&s;ion) in order to adverti&s;e you, <HI>that it is probable you will hear from &s;ome of your own relations on your [&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is between hooks [] thou maye&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, Jack, I &s;unk upon the women, in the account I gave them of the contents of this letter.</NOTE>] <HI>nuptials.</HI> One of the per&s;ons (Mr. Lilburne by name) to whom I hinted my belief of your marriage, hap|pens to be acquainted with Mr. Spurrier, Lady Betty Lawrance's &s;teward; and (not being under any re|&s;triction) mentioned it <HI>to</HI> Mr. Spurrier, and he to Lady Betty, as a thing certain: And this (tho' I have not the honour <HI>to be per&s;onally known to her lady&s;hip</HI>) brought on an inquiry from her lady&s;hip to me by her gentleman; who coming to me in company with Mr. Lilburne, I had no way but to confirm the report. And I under&s;tand, that Lady Betty takes it ami&s;s, that &s;he was not acquainted with &s;o de&s;irable a piece of news from your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip, it &s;eems, has <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s that calls her to town</HI>; [and you will po&s;&s;ibly choo&s;e to put her right. If you do, it will, I pre&s;ume, <HI>be in confidence</HI>; that nothing may per&s;pire from your <HI>own</HI> family to con|tradict what I have given out.]</P>
<P>[I have ever been of opinion, <HI>That truth ought to be &s;trictly adhered to on all occa&s;ions:</HI> And am con|cerned that I have departed (tho' with &s;o good a view) from my old maxim. But my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe would have it &s;o. Yet I never knew a de|parture of this kind a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> departure. But, to make the be&s;t of it now, allow me, Sir, once more to beg the lady, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to authenticate the re|port given out.] When you both join in the acknow|legement,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
it will be impertinent in any one to be in|qui&s;itive as to the <HI>day or week:</HI> [And, if as privately celebrated as you intend (while the gentlewomen with whom you lodge are properly in&s;tructed, as you &s;ay they are, and who actually believe you were mar|ried long ago), who &s;hall be able to give a contra|diction to my report?]</P>
<P>And yet it is very probable, that minute inquiries will be made; and this is what renders precaution nece&s;&s;ary. For Mr. James Harlowe will not believe that you are married; and is &s;ure, he &s;ays, that you both lived together when Mr. Hickman's application was made to Mr. John Harlowe: And if you lived to|gether <HI>any</HI> time unmarried, he infers from <HI>your</HI> charac|ter, Mr. Lovelace, that it is not probable, that you would ever marry. And he leaves it to his two uncles to decide, if you even <HI>&s;hould be</HI> married, whether there be not room to believe, that his &s;i&s;ter was fir&s;t di&s;|honoured; and if &s;o, to judge of the title &s;he will have to their favour, or to the forgivene&s;s of any of her family. I believe, Sir, this part of my letter had be&s;t to be kept from the lady.</P>
<P>What makes young Mr. Harlowe the more earne&s;t to find this out (and find it out he is re&s;olved, and to come at his &s;i&s;ter's &s;peech too; and for that purpo&s;e &s;ets out to-morrow, as I am well-informed, with a large attendance, armed, and Mr. Solmes is to be of the party) is this:&mdash;Mr. John Harlowe has told the whole family, that he will alter and new-&s;ettle his will. Mr. Antony Harlowe is re&s;olved to do the &s;ame by his; for, it &s;eems, he has now given over all thoughts of changing his condition; <HI>having lately been di&s;appointed in a view he had of that &s;ort with Mrs. Howe.</HI> The&s;e two brothers generally act in concert; and Mr. James Harlowe dreads (and let me tell you, that he has rea&s;on for it, on <HI>my</HI> Mr. Harlowe's account), that his younger &s;i&s;ter will be, at la&s;t, more benefited than he wi&s;hes for, by the al|teration
<PB N="39" REF="40">
intended. He has already been endeavour|ing to &s;ound his uncle Harlowe on this &s;ubject; and wanted to know whether any new application had been made to him on his &s;i&s;ter's part. Mr. Harlowe avoided a direct an&s;wer, and expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;hes for a general reconciliation, and his hopes that his niece was married. This offended the furious young man, and he reminded his uncle of engagements they had all entered into at his &s;i&s;ter's going away, <HI>not to be reconciled but by general con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. John Harlowe complains to me often, of the uncontroulablene&s;s of his nephew; and &s;ays, that now, that the young man has not any-body of who&s;e &s;uperior &s;en&s;e he &s;tands in awe, he ob&s;erves not de|cency in his behaviour to any of them. And this makes <HI>my</HI> Mr. Harlowe &s;till more de&s;irous than ever of bringing his younger niece into favour again. I will not &s;ay all I might of this young man's extraor|dinary rapaciou&s;ne&s;s:&mdash;But one would think, <HI>that the&s;e gra&s;ping men expect to live for ever!</HI></P>
<Q><P>I took the liberty but within the&s;e two hours, to propo&s;e to &s;et on foot (and offer'd my cover) to a corre&s;pondence between <HI>my friend, and his daughter-niece,</HI> as he &s;till &s;ometimes fondly calls her. She was mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o much prudence, I &s;aid, that I was &s;ure &s;he could better direct every thing to its de&s;irable end, than any-body el&s;e could. But he &s;aid, he did not think him&s;elf intirely at liberty to take &s;uch a &s;tep <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI>; and that it was be&s;t that he &s;hould have it in his power to &s;ay, occa&s;ionally, that he had not any corre&s;pondence <HI>with</HI> her, or letter <HI>from</HI> her.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, Sir, from all this, the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping our treaty an <HI>ab&s;olute &s;ecret</HI>; and if the lady has mentioned it to her <HI>worthy</HI> friend Mi&s;s Howe, I hope it is in confidence.</P></Q>
<P>And now, Sir, a few lines in an&s;wer to yours of Monday la&s;t.]</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">[Mr. Harlowe was very well plea&s;ed with your readine&s;s to come into his propo&s;al. But as to what you <HI>both</HI> de&s;ire, that he will be pre&s;ent at the cere|mony, he &s;aid, that his nephew watched all his &s;teps &s;o narrowly, that he thought it was not practicable (if he were inclinable) to oblige you: But that he con&s;ented with all his heart, that I &s;hould be the per|&s;on privately pre&s;ent at the ceremony, on his part.]</P>
<P>[However, I think, I have an <HI>expedient</HI> for this, if your lady <HI>continues</HI> to be very de&s;irous of her uncle's pre&s;ence (except he &s;hould be more determined than his an&s;wer &s;eemed to import); of which I &s;hall ac|quaint you, and perhaps of what he &s;ays to it, when I have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee you in town. But, indeed, I think you have no time to lo&s;e. Mr. Harlowe is impatient to hear, that you are actually one; and I hope I may carry him down word, when I leave you next, that I &s;aw the ceremony performed.]</P>
<P>[If any ob&s;tacle ari&s;es from the lady (from <HI>you</HI> it can|not), I &s;hall be tempted to think a little hardly of her punctilio.]</P>
<P>Mr. Harlowe hopes, Sir, that you will rather take pains to <HI>avoid,</HI> than to <HI>meet,</HI> this violent young man. He has the better opinion of you, let me tell you, Sir, from the account I gave him of your moderation and politene&s;s; neither of which are qualities with his nephew. <HI>But we have all of us &s;omething to amend.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot imagine how dearly my friend &s;till loves this excellent niece of his&mdash;I will give you an in&s;tance of it, which affected me a good deal.&mdash;
<Q>If once more (&s;aid he, the la&s;t time but one we were together) I can but &s;ee this &s;weet child gracing the upper-end of my table, as mi&s;tre&s;s of my hou&s;e, in my <HI>allotted month</HI>; all the re&s;t of the family pre&s;ent but as her gue&s;ts; for &s;o I <HI>would</HI> have it; and had her <HI>mother's con&s;ent for it</HI></Q>
&mdash;There he &s;topt; for he was forced to turn his reverend face from me.
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Tears ran down his cheeks. Fain would he have hid them: But he could not&mdash;
<Q>Yet,&mdash;yet, &s;aid he&mdash;how &mdash;how&mdash; (poor gentleman, he perfectly &s;obbed)&mdash; how &s;hall I be able to bear the fir&s;t meeting!</Q></P>
<P>I ble&s;s God I am <HI>no hard-hearted man,</HI> Mr. Love|lace: My eyes &s;hewed to my worthy friend, that he had no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of his humanity before me.</P>
<P>I will put an end to this long epi&s;tle. Be plea&s;ed to make my compliments acceptable to the mo&s;t ex|cellent of women; as well as believe me to be,</P>

<P>During the above conver&s;ation I had planted my|&s;elf at the further end of the apartment we were in, over-again&s;t the door; which was open; and oppo&s;ite to the lady's chamber-door; which was &s;hut. I &s;poke &s;o low, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, at that di&s;tance, that &s;he &s;hould hear what we &s;aid; and in this &s;ituation I could &s;ee if her door opened.</P>
<P>I told the women, that what I had mentioned of Lady Betty's and her niece's coming to town, and of their intention to vi&s;it my &s;pou&s;e, whom they had never &s;een, nor &s;he them, was real; and that I ex|pected news of their arrival every hour.

<P>I Under&s;tand, that at length all our wi&s;hes are an|&s;wered in your happy marriage. But I think, we might as well have heard of it directly from you, as from the round-about way by which we have been made acquainted with it. Methinks, Sir, the <HI>power</HI> and the <HI>will</HI> we have to oblige you, &s;hould not ex|po&s;e us the more to your &s;lights and negligence. My brother had &s;et his heart upon giving to you the wife we have all &s;o long wi&s;hed you to have. But if you were actually married at the time you made him that reque&s;t (&s;uppo&s;ing, perhaps, that his gout, would not let him attend you), it is but like <HI>you</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I gave the women room to think this reproach <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> Jack.</NOTE>.&mdash;If your lady had <HI>her</HI> rea&s;ons to wi&s;h it to be private while the differences between her family and &s;elf continue, you might neverthele&s;s have communica|ted it to us, with <HI>that</HI> re&s;triction; and we &s;hould have forborn the public manife&s;tations of our joy, upon an event we have &s;o long de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant way we have come to know it, is by my &s;teward; who is acquainted with a friend of Captain Tomlin&s;on, to whom that gentleman revealed it: And he, it &s;eems, had it from your&s;elf and lady, with &s;uch circum&s;tances as leave it not to be doubted.</P>
<P>I am, indeed, very much di&s;obliged with you: So is my &s;i&s;ter Sadleir. But I &s;hall have a very &s;peedy op|portunity to tell you &s;o in per&s;on; being obliged to go to town on my old Chancery-affair.

being matter of form only: On my return I &s;hall pop upon my brother, at M. Hall, to &s;ee in what way his la&s;t fit has left him.</P>
<P>Mean time, having told you my mind on your negligence, I cannot help congratulating you both upon the occa&s;ion: Your fair lady particularly, upon her entrance into a family, which is prepared to ad|mire and love her.</P>
<P>My principal intention of writing to you (di&s;pen&s;|ing with the nece&s;&s;ary punctilio) is, that you may acquaint my dear new niece, that I will not be de|nied the honour of her company down with me into Oxford&s;hire. I under&s;tand, that your propo&s;ed hou&s;e and equipages cannot be &s;oon ready. She &s;hall be with me till they are. I in&s;i&s;t upon it. This &s;hall make all up. My hou&s;e &s;hall be her own: My &s;ervants and equipages hers.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah, who has not been out of her own hou&s;e for months, will oblige me with her company for a week, in honour of a niece &s;o dearly beloved, as I am &s;ure &s;he will be of us all.</P>
<P>Being but in lodgings in town, neither you nor your lady can require much preparation.</P>
<P>Some time on Monday I hope to attend the dear young lady, to make her my compliments; and to receive <HI>her</HI> apology for <HI>your</HI> negligence: Which, and her going down with me, as I &s;aid before, &s;hall be full &s;atisfaction.

bead-roll of proverbs; of <HI>Black oxen, Wild oats, Long lanes,</HI> and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>Now, cou&s;in, &s;ay I, is your time come; and you will be no longer, I hope, an infidel either to the power or excellence of the &s;ex you have pretended hitherto &s;o much to undervalue; nor a ridiculer or &s;coffer at an in&s;titution which all &s;ober people reve|rence, and all rakes, &s;ooner or later, are brought to reverence, or to wi&s;h they had.</P>
<P>I want to &s;ee how you become your &s;ilken fetters: Whether the charming yoke fits light upon your &s;houlders. If, with &s;uch a &s;weet yoke-fellow it does not, my Lord, and my &s;i&s;ter, as well as I, think, that you will de&s;erve a clo&s;er tie about your neck.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip frets like gum'd taffaty, that you have not written him word of the day, the hour, the manner, and every thing. But I a&s;k him, How he can <HI>already</HI> expect any mark of deference or polite|ne&s;s from you? He mu&s;t &s;tay, I tell him, till that &s;ign of reformation, among others, mu&s;t appear from the influence and example of your lady: But that, if ever you will be good for any thing, it will be quickly &s;een. And Oh cou&s;in, what a va&s;t, va&s;t, journey have you to take from the dreary land of Libertini&s;m, thro' the bright province of Reformation, into the &s;erene kingdom of Happine&s;s!&mdash;You had need to lo&s;e no time. You have many a weary &s;tep to tread, before you can overtake tho&s;e travellers, who &s;et out for it from a le&s;s remote quarter. But you have a charming pole-&s;tar to guide you, that's your advantage. I wi&s;h you joy of it: And as I have never yet expected any highly complai&s;ant thing from you, I make no &s;cruple to begin fir&s;t; but it is purely, I mu&s;t tell you, in re&s;pect to my new cou&s;in; who&s;e acce&s;&s;ion into our family we mo&s;t heartily congratu|late and rejoice in.</P>
<P>I have a letter from Lady Betty. She commands my attendance, or my &s;i&s;ter's, at Reading, to proceed
<PB N="45" REF="46">
with her to the great bea&s;tly town, to cou&s;in Lee&s;on's. She puts Lord M. in hopes, that &s;he &s;hall certainly bring down with her our lovely new relation; for &s;he &s;ays, &s;he will not be denied. His Lord&s;hip is the willinger to let <HI>me</HI> be the per&s;on, as I am in a manner wild to &s;ee her; my &s;i&s;ter having two years ago had that honour at Sir Robert Biddulph's.

<P>The women having read the copies of the&s;e two letters, I thought that I might then threaten and &s;wagger&mdash;
<Q>But very little heart have I, &s;aid I, to encourage &s;uch a vi&s;it from Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Montague to my &s;pou&s;e. For after all, I am tired out with her &s;trange ways. She is not what &s;he was, and (as I told her in your hearing, ladies) I will leave this plaguy i&s;land, tho' the place of my birth, and tho' the &s;take I have in it is very con|&s;iderable; and go and re&s;ide in France or Italy, and never think of my&s;elf as a married man, <HI>nor live like one.</HI></Q></P>
<P>O dear! &s;aid one.</P>
<P>That would be a &s;ad thing! &s;aid the other.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, turning to Mrs. Moore&mdash;Indeed, Madam, to Mi&s;s Rawlins&mdash;I am quite de&s;perate. I can no longer bear &s;uch u&s;age. I have had the good fortune to be favoured by the &s;miles of very fine ladies, tho' I &s;ay it (and I looked mode&s;t), both abroad and at home&mdash;[Thou knowe&s;t this to be true, Jack]. With regard to my &s;pou&s;e here, I had but one hope left
<PB N="46" REF="47">
(for as to the reconciliation with her friends, I &s;corn them all too much to value that, but for her &s;ake); and that was, that if it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s us with children, &s;he might intirely recover her u&s;ual &s;erenity; and we might then be happy. But the reconciliation her heart was &s;o much &s;et upon, is now, as I hinted before, intirely hopele&s;s&mdash;Made &s;o, by this ra&s;h &s;tep of hers, and by the ra&s;her temper &s;he is in; &s;ince (as you will believe) her brother and &s;i&s;ter, when they come to know it, will make a fine handle of it again&s;t us both;&mdash;affecting, as they do at pre&s;ent, to di&s;believe our marriage&mdash;and the dear creature her&s;elf too ready to countenance &s;uch a disbelief,&mdash;as nothing <HI>more than the ceremony</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Here I was ba&s;hful; for Mi&s;s Rawlins by her pre|paratory primne&s;s, put me in mind, that it was <HI>proper to be &s;o</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I turned half round; then facing the fan-player, and the matron&mdash;You <HI>your&s;elves,</HI> ladies, knew not what to believe till <HI>Now,</HI> that I have told you our &s;tory: And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall not give my&s;elf the &s;ame trouble to convince people I hate: People from whom I neither expect nor de&s;ire any favour; and who are determined <HI>not</HI> to be convinced. And what, pray, mu&s;t be the i&s;&s;ue, when her uncle's friend comes, altho' he &s;eems to be a <HI>truly worthy man?</HI> Is it not natural for him to &s;ay,
<Q>To what purpo&s;e, Mr. Lovelace, &s;hould I endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between Mrs. Lovelace and her friends, by means of her elder uncle, when a good under&s;tanding is wanting between your&s;elves?</Q>
&mdash;A fair inference, Mrs. Moore!&mdash;A fair inference, Mi&s;s Rawlins!&mdash;And here is the unhappine&s;s&mdash;Till &s;he is reconciled to them, this cur&s;ed oath, in her notion, is binding!</P>
<P>The women &s;eem'd moved; for I &s;poke with great earne&s;tne&s;s, tho' low&mdash;And be&s;ides, they love to have their &s;ex, and its favours, appear of importance to us. They &s;hook their deep heads at each other,
<PB N="47" REF="48">
and looked &s;orrowful: And this moved my tender heart too.</P>
<P>'Tis an unheard-of ca&s;e, ladies&mdash;Had &s;he not pre|ferred me to all mankind&mdash;There I &s;topped&mdash;And that, re&s;umed I, feeling for my handkerchief, is, what &s;taggered Captain Tomlin&s;on, when he heard of her flight; who, the la&s;t time he &s;aw us together, &s;aw the mo&s;t affectionate couple on earth!&mdash;The mo&s;t affectionate couple on earth!&mdash;in the accent-grievous, repeated I.</P>
<P>Out then I pulled my handkerchief, and, putting it to my eyes, aro&s;e, and walked to the window&mdash;It makes me weaker than a woman!&mdash;Did I not love her, as never man loved <HI>his wife</HI> [I have no doubt but I do, Jack]&mdash;</P>
<P>There again I &s;topt; and re&s;uming&mdash;Charming creature, as you &s;ee &s;he is, I wi&s;h I had never beheld her face!&mdash;Excu&s;e me, ladies; traver&s;ing the room. And having rubbed my eyes till I &s;uppo&s;ed them red, I turned to the women; and, pulling out my letter|ca&s;e, I will &s;hew you one letter&mdash;Here it is&mdash;Read it, Mi&s;s Rawlins, if you plea&s;e&mdash;It will confirm to you, how much all my family are prepared to ad|mire her. I am freely treated in it;&mdash;&s;o I am in the two others: But after what I have told you, no|thing need be a &s;ecret to you two.</P>
<P>She took it, with an air of eager curio&s;ity, and looked at the &s;eal, o&s;tentatiou&s;ly coronetted; and at the &s;uper&s;cription, reading out, <HI>To Robert Lovelace, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI>&mdash; Ay, Madam&mdash;Ay, Mi&s;s&mdash;that's my name (giving my&s;elf an air, tho' I had told it to them be|fore) I am not a&s;hamed of it. My wife's maiden name&mdash;<HI>Unmarried</HI> name, I &s;hould rather &s;ay,&mdash;fool that I am!&mdash;and I rubbed my cheek for vexation [Fool enough in con&s;cience, Jack!] was Harlowe&mdash; Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe &mdash; You heard me call her <HI>My Clari&s;&s;a.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I did&mdash;but thought it to be a feigned or love-name, &s;aid Mi&s;s Rawlins.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">I wonder what is Mi&s;s Rawlins's love-name, Jack. Mo&s;t of the fair Romancers have in their early womanhood cho&s;en Love-names. No par&s;on ever gave more <HI>real</HI> names, than I have given <HI>fictitious</HI> ones. And to very good purpo&s;e: Many a &s;weet dear has an&s;wered me a letter for the &s;ake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her.</P>
<P>No&mdash;It was her real name, I &s;aid.</P>
<P>I bid her read out the whole letter. If the &s;pell|ing be not exact, Mi&s;s Rawlins, &s;aid I, you will ex|cu&s;e it; the writer is a Lord. But, perhaps, I may not &s;hew it to my &s;pou&s;e; for if tho&s;e I have left with her have no effect upon her, neither will this: And I &s;hall not care to expo&s;e my Lord M. to her &s;corn. Indeed I begin to be quite carele&s;s of con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins, who could not but be plea&s;ed with this mark of my confidence, looked as if &s;he pitied me.</P>
<P>And here thou maye&s;t read the letter. No. III.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Cou&s;in Lovelace,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>M. Hall,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Wedn. June</HI> 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Think you might have found time to let us know of your nuptials being actually &s;olempnized. I might have expected this piece of civility from you. But perhaps the ceremony was performed at the very time that you a&s;ked me to be your lady's father&mdash;But I &s;hall be angry if I proceed in my gue&s;&s;es&mdash;And <HI>little &s;aid is &s;oon amended.</HI></P>
<P>But I can tell you, that Lady Betty Lawrance, what|ever Lady Sarah does, will not &s;o &s;oon forgive you, as I have done. <HI>Women re&s;ent &s;lights longer than men.</HI> You that know &s;o much of the &s;ex (I &s;peak it not how|ever to your prai&s;e) might have known <HI>That.</HI> But never was you before acquainted with a lady of &s;uch an amiable character. I hope there will be but one &s;oul between you. I have before now &s;aid, that I will
<PB N="49" REF="50">
di&s;inherit you, and &s;ettle all I can upon her, if you prove not a good hu&s;band to her.</P>
<P>May this marriage be crowned with a great many fine boys (I de&s;ire no girls) to build up again a family &s;o antient! The fir&s;t boy &s;hall take my &s;urname by act of parliament. That is in my will.</P>
<P>Lady Betty and niece Charlotte will be in town about bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>before you know where you are.</HI> They long to pay their compliments to your fair bride. I &s;uppo&s;e you will hardly be at the Lawn when they get to town; becau&s;e Greme informs me, you have &s;ent no orders there for your lady's accommodation.</P>
<P>Pritchard has all things in readine&s;s for &s;igning. I will take no advantage of your &s;lights. Indeed I am too much u&s;ed to them&mdash;More prai&s;e to my patience, than to your complai&s;ance, however.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on for Lady Betty's going up, as I may tell you <HI>under the ro&s;e,</HI> is, to buy &s;ome &s;uitable pre|&s;ents for Lady Sarah and all of us to make on this agreeable occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We would have blazed it away, could we have had timely notice, and thought it would have been agreeable to all round. The <HI>like occa&s;ions don't hap|pen every day.</HI></P>
<P>My mo&s;t affectionate compliments and congratu|lations to my new niece, conclude me, for the pre|&s;ent, in violent pains, that with all your heroicalne&s;s would make you mad,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your truly affectionate Uncle, <HI>M.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter clench'd the nail. Not but that, Mi&s;s Rawlins &s;aid, &s;he &s;aw I had been a wild gentleman; and, truly, &s;he thought &s;o, the moment &s;he beheld me.</P>
<P>They began to intercede for my &s;pou&s;e (&s;o nicely had I turn'd the tables), and that I would not go abroad, and di&s;appoint a reconciliation &s;o much wi&s;hed
<PB N="50" REF="51">
for on one &s;ide, and &s;uch de&s;irable pro&s;pects on the other in my own family.</P>
<P>Who knows, thought I to my&s;elf, but more may come of this plot, than I had even promi&s;ed my&s;elf? What a happy man &s;hall I be, if the&s;e women can be brought to join to carry my marriage into con&s;umma|tion?</P>
<P>Ladies, you are exceeding good to us both. I &s;hould have &s;ome hopes, if my unhappily-nice &s;pou&s;e could be brought to di&s;pen&s;e with the unnatural oath &s;he has laid me under. You &s;ee what my ca&s;e is. Do you think I may not in&s;i&s;t upon her ab&s;olving me from this abominable oath? Will you be &s;o good, as to give your advice, that one apartment may &s;erve for a man and his wife at the hour of retirement? &mdash;Mode&s;tly put, Belford!&mdash;And let me here ob&s;erve, that few rakes, be&s;ides me, would find a language &s;o decent, as to engage mode&s;t women to talk with him in, upon &s;uch &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>They both &s;imper'd, and look'd upon one an|other.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ubjects always make women &s;imper, at lea&s;t. No <HI>need</HI> but of the mo&s;t delicate hints to <HI>them.</HI> A man who is gro&s;s in a woman's company, ought to be knock'd down with a club: For, like &s;o many mu&s;ical in&s;truments, touch but a &s;ingle wire, and the dear &s;ouls are &s;en&s;ible all over.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Mi&s;s Rawlins learnedly &s;aid, playing with her fan, a ca&s;ui&s;t would give it, that the matri|monial vow ought to &s;uper&s;ede any other obligation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore, for her part, was of opinion, that, if the lady owned her&s;elf to be a wife, &s;he ought to behave <HI>like</HI> one.</P>
<P>Whatever be my luck, thought I, with this <HI>all-eyed</HI> fair one, any other woman in the world, from fifteen to five-and-twenty, would be mine upon my own terms before the morning.</P>
<P>And now, that I may be at hand to take all ad|vantages,
<PB N="51" REF="52">
I will endeavour, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to make &s;ure of good quarters.</P>
<P>I am your lodger, Mrs. Moore, in virtue of the earne&s;t I have given you, for the&s;e apartments, and for any one you can &s;pare above for my &s;ervants; Indeed for <HI>all</HI> you have to &s;pare&mdash;for who knows what my &s;pou&s;e's brother may attempt? I will pay you your own demand: and that for a month or two certain (board included), as I &s;hall or &s;hall not be your hindrance. Take <HI>that</HI> as a pledge; or in part of payment.&mdash;Offering her a thirty pound bank note.</P>
<P>She declined taking it; de&s;iring &s;he might con&s;ult the lady fir&s;t; adding, that &s;he doubted not my ho|nour; and that &s;he would not lett her apartments to any other per&s;on, whom &s;he knew not &s;omething of, while I and the lady were here.</P>
<P><HI>The lady, The lady!</HI> from both the womens mouths continually (which &s;till implied a doubt in their hearts): And not <HI>Your &s;pou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Your lady, Sir.</HI></P>
<P>I never met with &s;uch women, thought I; &mdash; So thoroughly convinced but this moment, yet already doubting! I am afraid I have a couple of Sceptics to deal with.</P>
<P>I knew no rea&s;on, I &s;aid, for my wife to object to my lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her here, any more than in town, at Mrs. Sinclair's. But were &s;he to make &s;uch objection, I would not quit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;ince it was not unlikely, that the &s;ame freaki&s;h di&s;order which brought her to Ham&s;tead, might carry her ab|&s;olutely out of my knowlege.</P>
<P>They both &s;eemed embarra&s;&s;ed; and looked upon one another; yet with &s;uch an air, as if they thought there was rea&s;on in what I &s;aid. And I declared my|&s;elf her boarder, as well as lodger; and, dinner-time approaching, was not denied to be the former.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>I Thought it was now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved; who had had full lei&s;ure to weigh the contents of the letters I had left with her.</P>
<P>I therefore reque&s;ted Mrs. Moore to &s;tep in, and de&s;ire to know, whether &s;he would be plea&s;ed to admit me to attend her in her apartment, on occa&s;ion of the letters I had left with her; or whether &s;he would fa|vour me with her company in the dining-room?</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore de&s;ired Mi&s;s Rawlins to accompany her in to the lady. They tapp'd at her door, and were both admitted.</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;top here for one minute, to remark, tho' again&s;t my&s;elf, upon that &s;ecurity which inno|cence gives, that neverthele&s;s had better have in it a greater mixture of the Serpent with the Dove. For here, heedle&s;s of all I could &s;ay behind her back, be|cau&s;e &s;he was &s;atisfied with her own worthine&s;s, &s;he permitted me to go on with my own &s;tory, without interruption, to per&s;ons as great &s;trangers to her as to me; and who, as &s;trangers to <HI>both,</HI> might be &s;up|po&s;ed to lean to the &s;ide mo&s;t injured: And that, as I managed it, was to mine. A dear &s;illy &s;oul! thought I, at the time, to depend upon the goodne&s;s of her own heart, when the heart cannot be &s;een into but by its actions; and &s;he, to appearance, a runaway, an eloper, from a tender, a mo&s;t indulgent hu&s;band!&mdash;To neglect to cultivate the opinion of in|dividuals, when the whole world is governed by ap|pearance!</P>
<P>Yet, what can be expected of an angel under twenty?&mdash;She has a world of knowlege; knowlege <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> as I may &s;ay; but no <HI>experience!</HI> How &s;hould &s;he?&mdash;Knowlege by theory only is a vague un|certain

light: A Will o' the Wi&s;p, which as often mi&s;leads the doubting mind, as puts it right.</P>
<P>There are many things in the world, could a moralizer &s;ay, that would afford inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to a reflecting mind, were it not for the mixture they come to us with. To be graver &s;til; I have &s;een parents (perhaps my own did &s;o) who delighted in tho&s;e very qualities in their children, while young, the natural con&s;equences of which (too much in|dulged and encouraged) made them, as they grew up, the plague of their hearts.&mdash;To bring this home to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I mu&s;t tell thee, that I adore this charming creature for her vigilant prudence; but yet, I would not, methinks, wi&s;h her, by virtue of that prudence, which is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to carry her above the <HI>devices</HI> of all the re&s;t of the world, to be too wi&s;e for <HI>mine.</HI></P>
<P>My revenge, my <HI>&s;worn</HI> revenge, is neverthele&s;s (adore her as I will) uppermo&s;t in my heart!&mdash;Mi&s;s Howe &s;ays, that my Love is an <HI>Herodian</HI> Love <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 340.</NOTE>: By my &s;oul, that girl's a witch!&mdash;I am half &s;orry to &s;ay, that I find a plea&s;ure in playing the tyrant over what I love. Call it an ungenerous plea&s;ure, if thou wilt: Softer hearts than mine know it. The women to a woman know it, and <HI>&s;hew</HI> it too, whenever they are tru&s;ted with power. And why &s;hould it be thought &s;trange, that I, who love them &s;o dearly, and &s;tudy them &s;o much, &s;hould catch the infection of them?</P>

<P>Well, 'tis a &s;trange ca&s;e, a very &s;trange one, &s;aid Mi&s;s Rawlins; and was going to &s;ay further, when the angry Beauty, coming towards the door, &s;aid, Mrs. Moore, I beg a word with you. And they both &s;tepped into the dining-room.</P>

<P>Not in the way, &s;aid I!&mdash;Whither can the dogs be gone?</P>
<P>O Sir! with a &s;cornful air; Not far, I'll warrant. One of them was under the window ju&s;t now; ac|cording to order, I &s;uppo&s;e, to watch my &s;teps&mdash;But I will do what I plea&s;e, and go whither I plea&s;e; and that to your face.</P>

<P>The women, as I had owned our marriage to be but half completed, heard nothing in this whole &s;cene to contradict (not flagrantly to contradict) what I had a&s;&s;erted: They believed they &s;aw in her returning temper, and &s;tagger'd re&s;olution, a love for me, which her indignation had before &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and they joined to per&s;uade her to tarry till the Captain came, and to hear his propo&s;als; repre&s;enting the dangers to which &s;he would be expo&s;ed; the fatigues &s;he might endure; a lady of her appearance, unguarded, un|protected. On the other hand, they dwelt upon my declared contrition, and on my promi&s;es: For the performance of which they offered to be bound.&mdash;So much had my kneeling humility affected them.</P>
<P>Women, Jack, tacitly acknowlege the inferiority of their own &s;ex, in the pride they take to behold a kneeling lover at their feet.</P>

<P>The women believing we were likely to be on better terms, retired. The dear perver&s;e oppo&s;ed their going; but they &s;aw I was de&s;irous of their ab|&s;ence.

<P>I <HI>have</HI> given it the requi&s;ite attention, &s;aid &s;he; and the other letters too. So that what I &s;ay, is upon deliberation.

You, Sir, I thank you, have lowered my fortunes: But, I ble&s;s God, that my mind is not &s;unk with my fortunes. It is, on the contrary, rai&s;ed above Fortune, and above You; and for half a word, they &s;hall have the e&s;tate they have envied me for, and an acquittal of all expectations from my family, that may make them unea&s;y.</P>
<P>I lifted up my hands and eyes in &s;ilent admiration of her!</P>
<P>My brother, Sir, may think me ruined. To the prai&s;e of <HI>your</HI> character, by whom I have been &s;e|duced from them, he may think it it impo&s;&s;ible to be with <HI>you,</HI> and be innocent. You have but too well ju&s;tified their har&s;he&s;t cen&s;ures in every part of your conduct. But I will, now that I have e&s;caped from you, and that I am out of the reach of your my&s;te|rious devices, wrap my&s;elf up in my own innocence (and then &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately folded her arms about her|&s;elf), and leave to time, and to my future circum|&s;pection, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my character.&mdash; Leave me then, Sir&mdash;Pur&s;ue me not!&mdash;</P>

<P>For God's &s;ake, Madam, for a &s;oul's &s;ake, which it is in your power to &s;ave from perdition, forgive me the pa&s;t offence.

<P>She flung from me to the further end of the room; <HI>She could go no further</HI>&mdash;And ju&s;t then Mrs. Moore came up, and told her, that dinner was ready; and that &s;he had prevailed upon Mi&s;s Rawlins to give her her company.</P>

<P>I re&s;pectfully withdrew into the next room, that Mrs. Moore might acquaint her [I dur&s;t not my&s;elf], that I was her lodger and boarder, as (whi&s;peringly) I de&s;ired &s;he would: And meeting Mi&s;s Rawlins in the pa&s;&s;age, Deare&s;t Mi&s;s Rawlins, &s;aid I, &s;tand my friend: Join with Mrs. Moore to pacify my &s;pou&s;e, if &s;he has any new f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ights upon my having taken lodgings, and intending to board here.

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. Moore (whom I left with my fair one) had appri&s;ed her of this before Mi&s;s Rawlins went in; for I heard her &s;ay, while I with-held Mi&s;s Rawlins&mdash;
<Q>No, indeed: He is much mi&s;taken&mdash; Surely he does not think I will.</Q></P>
<P>They both expo&s;tulated with her, as I could ga|ther from bits and &s;craps of what they &s;aid; for they

&s;poke &s;o low, that I could not hear any di&s;tinct &s;en|tence, but from the fair perver&s;e, who&s;e anger made her louder. And to this purpo&s;e I heard her deliver her&s;elf in an&s;wer to different parts of their talk to her: &mdash;
<Q>Good Mrs. Moore, dear Mi&s;s Rawlins, pre&s;s me no further&mdash;I cannot &s;it down at table with him!</Q></P>
<P>They &s;aid &s;omething, as I &s;uppo&s;e in my behalf&mdash;
<Q>O the in&s;inuating wretch!&mdash;What defence have I again&s;t a man, who, go where I will, can turn every one, even of the virtuous of my &s;ex, in his favour?</Q></P>
<P>After &s;omething el&s;e &s;aid, which I heard not di|&s;tinctly,&mdash;
<Q>This is execrable cunning!&mdash;Were you to know his wicked heart, he is not without hope of engaging you two good per&s;ons to &s;econd him in the vile&s;t of his machinations.</Q></P>

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then, they urged the plea which I hinted to Mi&s;s Rawlins at going in, that &s;he would not be Mrs. Moore's hindrance; for thus &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf&mdash;
<Q>He will no doubt pay you your own price. You need not que&s;tion his liberality. But one hou&s;e cannot hold us. Why, if it would, did I fly from him, to &s;eek refuge among &s;trangers?</Q></P>
<P>Then, in an&s;wer to &s;omewhat el&s;e they pleaded&mdash;
<Q>'Tis a mi&s;take, Madam; I am <HI>not</HI> reconciled to him. I will believe nothing he &s;ays.

<P>Then in an&s;wer, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to their offer of &s;ending her up a plate&mdash;
<Q>A bit of bread, if you plea&s;e, and a gla&s;s of water: That's all I can &s;wallow at pre&s;ent. I am really very much di&s;compo&s;ed. Saw you not how bad I was?&mdash;Indignation only could have &s;upported my &s;pirits!&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>'I have no objection to his dining with you, Madam;' added &s;he, in reply, I &s;uppo&s;e, to a farther que&s;tion of the &s;ame nature&mdash;
<Q>But I will not &s;tay a night in the hou&s;e, where he lodges, if I can help it.</Q></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume Mi&s;s Rawlins had told her, that &s;he would not &s;tay dinner&mdash;for &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>Let me not deprive Mrs. Moore of your company, Mi&s;s Raw|lins. You will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with his talk. He can have no de&s;ign upon you.</Q></P>
<P>Then I &s;uppo&s;e they pleaded what I might &s;ay be|hind her back, to make my own &s;tory good;&mdash;
<Q>I care not what he &s;ays, or what he thinks of me. Repentance and amendment are all the harm I wi&s;h him, whatever becomes of me!</Q></P>
<P>By her accent, &s;he wept when &s;he &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t words.</P>
<P>They came out both of them wiping their eyes; and would have per&s;uaded me to relinqui&s;h the lodg|ings, and to depart till her uncle's friend came. But I knew better. I did not care to tru&s;t the devil, well as &s;he and Mi&s;s Howe &s;uppo&s;e me to be acquainted with him, for finding her out again, if once more &s;he e&s;caped me.</P>
<P>What I am mo&s;t afraid of, is, that &s;he will throw her&s;elf among her own relations; and if &s;he does, I am confident they will not be able to with&s;tand her affecting eloquence. But yet, as thou'lt &s;ee, the Captain's letter to me is admirably calculated to ob|viate
<PB N="72" REF="73">
my apprehen&s;ions on this &s;core; particularly in that pa&s;&s;age, where it is &s;aid, that her uncle thinks not him&s;elf at liberty to corre&s;pond directly with her, or to receive applications from her&mdash;<HI>But thro' Captain Tomlin&s;on,</HI> as is &s;trongly imply'd <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>39.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own (notwith&s;tanding the revenge I have &s;o &s;olemnly vowed) that I would very fain have made for her a merit with my&s;elf <HI>in her returning favour,</HI> and owed as little as po&s;&s;ible to the mediation of Cap|tain Tomlin&s;on.

<P>I was, however, glad at my heart, that Mrs. Moore came up &s;o &s;ea&s;onably with notice, that dinner was ready. The fair fugitive was all in Alt.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER V.</HI> Mr. <HI>LOVELACE.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>WE had at dinner, be&s;ides Mi&s;s Rawlins, a young widow-niece of Mrs. Moore, who is come to &s;tay a month with her aunt&mdash;<HI>Bevis</HI> her name; very forward, very lively, and a great admirer of <HI>me,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you; &mdash; hanging &s;mirkingly upon all I &s;aid; and prepared to approve of every word before I &s;poke: And who, by the time we had half-dined (by the help of what &s;he had collected before), was as
<PB N="74" REF="75">
much acquainted with our &s;tory, as either of the other two.</P>
<P>As it behoved me to prepare them in my favour again&s;t whatever might come from Mi&s;s Howe, I im|proved upon the hint I had thrown out above-&s;tairs again&s;t that mi&s;chief-making Lady. I repre&s;ented her to be an arrogant creature, revengeful, artful, enterpri&s;ing, and one who, had &s;he been a man, would have &s;worn and curs'd, and committed rapes, and play'd the devil, as far as I knew [and I have no doubt of it, Jack]: but who, neverthele&s;s, by ad|vantage of a female education, and pride, and in&s;o|lence, I believed was <HI>per&s;onally</HI> virtuous.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bevis allowed, that there was a <HI>va&s;t deal</HI> in education&mdash;and in <HI>pride</HI> too, &s;he &s;aid. While Mi&s;s Rawlins came with a prudi&s;h God forbid, that virtue &s;hould be owing to education only! However, I declared, that Mi&s;s Howe was a &s;ubtle contriver of mi&s;chief; one who had always been <HI>my</HI> enemy: her motives I knew not: but, de&s;pi&s;ing the man whom her mother was de&s;irous &s;he &s;hould have, one Hick|man; altho' I did not directly averr, that &s;he would rather have had me; yet they all immediately ima|gined, that <HI>that</HI> was the ground of her animo&s;ity to me, and of her envy to my beloved; and it was pity, they &s;aid, that &s;o fine a young Lady did not &s;ee thro' &s;uch a pretended friend.</P>
<P>And yet nobody (added I) has more rea&s;on than &s;he to know by <HI>experience</HI> the force of a hatred founded in envy; as I hinted to <HI>you</HI> above, Mrs. Moore, and to <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Rawlins, in the ca&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter Ara|bella.</P>
<P>I had compliments made to my per&s;on and talents on this occa&s;ion; which gave me a &s;ingular opportu|nity of di&s;playing my mode&s;ty, by di&s;claiming the merit of them, with a <HI>No, indeed!&mdash;I &s;hould be very vain, Ladies, if I thought &s;o.</HI> While thus aba&s;ing
<PB N="75" REF="76">
my&s;elf, and exalting Mi&s;s Howe, I got their opinion both for mode&s;ty and genero&s;ity; and had all the graces which I di&s;claimed, thrown in upon me, be|&s;ides.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they even oppre&s;&s;ed that mode&s;ty, which (to &s;peak mode&s;tly of my&s;elf) their prai&s;es <HI>created,</HI> by di&s;believing all I &s;aid again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>And, truly, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, they have almo&s;t per&s;uaded even me my&s;elf, that Mi&s;s Howe is actu|ally in love with me. I have often been willing to hope this. And who knows but &s;he may? The Cap|tain and I have agreed, that it &s;hall be &s;o in&s;inuated <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI>&mdash;And what's thy opinion, Jack? She cer|tainly hates Hickman: And girls who are <HI>di&s;engaged</HI> &s;eldom <HI>hate,</HI> tho' they may not <HI>love:</HI> And if &s;he had rather have <HI>another,</HI> why not that <HI>other</HI> ME? For am I not a &s;mart fellow, and a rake? And do not your &s;prightly Ladies love your &s;mart fellows, and your rakes? And where is the wonder, that the man who could engage the affections of Mi&s;s Harlowe, &s;hould engage tho&s;e of a Lady (with her <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See vol. iv. p. 341, where Mi&s;s Howe &s;ays, <HI>Alas, my dear, I knew you loved him!</HI></NOTE> <HI>Alas's</HI>) who would be honoured in being deemed her &s;econd?</P>
<P>Nor accu&s;e thou me of SINGULAR vanity in this pre&s;umption, Belford. Wert thou to know the &s;e|cret vanity that lurks in the hearts of tho&s;e who <HI>di&s;|gui&s;e</HI> or <HI>cloak it be&s;t,</HI> thou would&s;t find great rea&s;on to acquit, at lea&s;t to allow for, <HI>me:</HI> &s;ince it is gene|rally the <HI>con&s;cious over-fulne&s;s of conceit,</HI> that makes the hypocrite mo&s;t upon his guard to conceal it.&mdash; Yet with the&s;e fellows, proudly-humble as they are, it will break out &s;ometimes in &s;pite of thier cloaks, tho' but in &s;elf-denying, compliment-begging &s;elf-degra|dation.</P>
<P>But now I have appealed this matter to thee, let
<PB N="76" REF="77">
me u&s;e another argument in favour of my ob&s;erva|tion, that the Ladies generally prefer a rake to a &s;ober man; and of my pre&s;umption upon it, that Mi&s;s Howe is in love with me: It is this:&mdash;Common fame &s;ays, That Hickman is a very virtuous, a very innocent fellow&mdash;a <HI>male-virgin,</HI> I warrant!&mdash;An odd dog I al|ways thought him.&mdash;Now women, Jack, like not novices. They are plea&s;ed with a Love of the Sex that is founded in the knowlege of it. Rea&s;on good. Novices expect more than they can po&s;&s;ibly find in the commerce with them. The man who knows them, yet has <HI>ardors</HI> for them, to borrow a word from Mi&s;s Howe <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 69. and 135.</NOTE>, tho' tho&s;e ardors are generally owing more to the devil <HI>within</HI> him, than to the witch <HI>without</HI> him, is the man who makes them the highe&s;t and mo&s;t grateful compliment. He knows what to expect, and with what to be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Then the merit of a woman, in &s;ome ca&s;es, mu&s;t be <HI>ignorance,</HI> whether <HI>real</HI> or <HI>pretended.</HI> The Man, in <HI>the&s;e</HI> ca&s;es, mu&s;t be an <HI>adept.</HI> Will it then be wondered at, that a woman prefers a libertine to a novice?&mdash;While &s;he expects in the one the confidence <HI>&s;he</HI> wants; &s;he con&s;iders the other and her&s;elf as two parallel lines; which, tho' they run &s;ide by &s;ide, can never meet.</P>
<P>Yet in this the Sex is generally mi&s;taken too; for the&s;e &s;heepi&s;h fellows are fly.&mdash;I my&s;elf was mode&s;t once; and this, as I have el&s;ewhere hinted to thee <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii. p. 130, 131.</NOTE>, has better enabled me to judge of both.&mdash;But to proceed with my narrative:</P>
<P>Having thus prepared every-one again&s;t any letter &s;hould come from Mi&s;s Howe, and again&s;t my belo|ved's me&s;&s;enger returns, I thought it proper to con|clude that &s;ubject with a hint, that my &s;pou&s;e could not bear to have any-thing &s;aid <HI>that reflected upon
<PB N="77" REF="78">
Mi&s;s Howe</HI>; and, with a deep &s;igh, added, that I had been made very unhappy more than once by the ill-will of Ladies, whom I had never offended.</P>
<P>The widow Bevis believed, that might very ea&s;ily be.</P>
<P>The&s;e hints within-doors, joined with others to Will. both without and within (for I intend he &s;hall fall in love with widow Moore's maid, and have &s;aved one hundred pounds in my &s;ervice, at lea&s;t), will be great helps, as things may happen.</P>

<P>WE had hardly dined, when my coachman, who kept a look-out for Captain Tomlin&s;on, as Will. did for old Grimes, conducted hither that worthy gentleman, attended by one &s;ervant, <HI>both</HI> on hor&s;e|back. He alighted. I went out to meet him at the door.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t his &s;olemn appearance, and un|blu&s;hing freedom; and yet can&s;t not imagine what a dignity the ra&s;cal a&s;&s;umed, nor how re&s;pectful to him I was.</P>
<P>I led him into the parlour, and pre&s;ented him to the women, and them to him.&mdash;I thought it highly imported me (as they might &s;till have &s;ome diffidences about our marriage, from my fair-one's home pu&s;h'd que&s;tions on that head) to convince them intirely of the truth of all I had a&s;&s;erted.

<P>Then had we between us the characters of the Harlowe family: I railing again&s;t them all; the Cap|tain taking his dear friend Mr. John Harlowe's part; with a <HI>Not &s;o fa&s;t!&mdash;Not &s;o fa&s;t, young gentleman!</HI>&mdash; and the like free a&s;&s;umptions.</P>
<P>He accounted for <HI>their</HI> animo&s;ity by <HI>my</HI> defiances: No good family, having &s;uch a charming daughter, would care to be <HI>defied,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>courted:</HI> He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;peak his mind: Never was a double-tongu'd man.&mdash; He appealed to the Ladies, if he were not right.</P>
<P>He got them of his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The correction I had given the brother, he told me, mu&s;t have aggravated matters.</P>
<P>How valiant this made me look to the women!&mdash; The Sex love us mettled fellows at their hearts.</P>
<P>Be that as it would, I &s;hould never love any of the family but my &s;pou&s;e; and, wanting nothing from them, would not, but for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, have gone &s;o far as I <HI>had</HI> gone towards a reconciliation.</P>
<P>This was very good of me; Mrs. Moore &s;aid.</P>
<P>Very good indeed; Mi&s;s Rawlins.</P>
<P>Good!&mdash;It is <HI>more</HI> than good; it is very generous; &s;aid the widow.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;o it is, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay: For I am &s;en&s;ible, that Mr. Lovelace has been rudely treated by them all&mdash;More rudely, than it could have been imagined a man of his <HI>quality</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> would have put up with. But then, Sir

I think you are amply rewarded in &s;uch a Lady; and that you ought to forgive the father for the daugh|ter's &s;ake.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow B.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine Lady! to be &s;ure! But &s;he has a violent &s;pirit; and &s;ome very odd humours too, by what I have heard. The value of good hu&s;bands is not known till they are lo&s;t!</P>

<P>Her con&s;cience then drew a &s;igh from her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody mu&s;t reflect upon my angel.&mdash;An angel &s;he is.&mdash;Some little blemi&s;hes, indeed, as to her over-ha&s;ty &s;pirit, and as to her unforgiving tem|per.

<P>Ay, talk of &s;pirit, There's a &s;pirit, now you have named Mi&s;s Howe! [And &s;o I led him to confirm all I had &s;aid of that vixen.] Yet &s;he was to be pitied too, looking with meaning at me.</P>

<P>As I have already hinted, I had before agreed with him to impute &s;ecret love <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> to Mi&s;s Howe, as the be&s;t means to invalidate all that might come from her in my disfavour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Captain, you may &s;ay any-thing before this company&mdash;Only, Andrew, to my new &s;ervant, who attended us at table, do you withdraw: This good girl

will help us to all we want.</P>

<P>As to our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;ituation, I &s;ay, Mr. Love|lace&mdash;Why, Sir, we &s;hall be all <HI>untwi&s;ted,</HI> let me tell you, if my friend Mr. John Harlowe were to know what <HI>that</HI> is: He would as much que&s;tion the truth of your being married, as the re&s;t of the fa|mily do.</P>

<P><HI>I asked you before</HI> for particulars, Mr. Love|lace: but you <HI>declined giving them.</HI>&mdash;Indeed it may not be <HI>proper</HI> for me to be acquainted with them.&mdash; But I mu&s;t own, that it is pa&s;t my comprehen&s;ion, that a wife can re&s;ent any-thing a hu&s;band can do (that is not a breach of the peace), &s;o far as to think her&s;elf ju&s;tified for <HI>eloping</HI> from him.</P>

<P>Captain Tomlin&s;on&mdash;Sir&mdash;I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall be offended&mdash;I &s;hall be extremely con|cerned&mdash;if I hear that word mention'd again&mdash;</P>

<P>Your nicety, and your love, Sir, may make you take offence&mdash;But it is my way to call every|thing by its proper name, let who will be offended&mdash;</P>

<P>When, <HI>young Gentleman,</HI> you &s;hall think proper to give us particulars, we will find a word that &s;hall plea&s;e you better, for this ra&s;h act in &s;o admi|rable a Lady&mdash;You &s;ee, Sir, that, being the repre|&s;entative of my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe, I &s;peak as freely as I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>he</HI> would do, if pre&s;ent.

</SP>
<P>I did not blu&s;h, Jack; but denied not the com|pliment, and looked down: the women &s;eem'd de|lighted with my mode&s;ty: but the widow Bevis was

more inclined to laugh at me, than prai&s;e me for it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever be the cau&s;e of this &s;tep (I will not again, Sir, call it <HI>elopement,</HI> &s;ince that har&s;h word wounds your tenderne&s;s), 
I cannot but expre&s;s my &s;urprize upon it, when I recollect the affection|ate behaviour, which I was witne&s;s to between you, when I attended you la&s;t. <HI>Over-love,</HI> Sir, I think you once mentioned&mdash;but <HI>Over-love</HI>

<P>Dear Captain! And I tried to blu&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<P>The women al&s;o tried; and, being more u&s;ed to it, &s;ucceeded better.&mdash;Mrs. Bevis, indeed, has a red-hot countenance, and always blu&s;hes.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;ignifies nothing to mince the matter: but the Lady above as good as denies her marriage. You <HI>know,</HI> Sir, that &s;he does; turning to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Denies her marriage! Heavens! how then have I impo&s;ed upon my dear friend Mr. John Har|lowe!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear!&mdash;But let not her <HI>veracity</HI> be called in que&s;tion. She would not be guilty of a wil|ful untruth for the world.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then I had all their prai&s;es again.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear creature!&mdash;&s;he thinks &s;he has rea&s;on for her denial. You know, Mrs. Moore; you know, Mi&s;s Rawlins; what I owned to you above, as to my vow&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>I look'd down, and, as once before, turned round my diamond ring.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore looked awry; and with a leer at Mi&s;s Rawlins, as to her partner in the hinted-at refer|ence.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins look'd down as well as I; her eye|lids half-clo&s;ed, as if mumbling a Pater-no&s;ter, me|ditating
<PB N="82" REF="83">
her &s;nuff-box, the di&s;tance between her no&s;e and chin lengthened by a clo&s;e-&s;hut mouth.</P>
<P>She put me in mind of the pious Mrs. Fether&s;tone at Oxford, whom I pointed out to thee once, among other grote&s;que figures, at St. Mary's church, where we went to take a view of her two &s;i&s;ters: Her eyes &s;hut, not daring to tru&s;t her heart with them open; and but ju&s;t half-rearing the lids, to &s;ee who the next-comer was; and falling them again, when her curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The widow Bevis gazed, as if on the hunt for a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The Captain looked archly, as if half in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore at la&s;t broke the ba&s;hful &s;ilence. Mrs. Lovelace's behaviour, &s;he &s;aid, could be no other|wi&s;e &s;o well accounted-for, as by the ill-offices of <HI>that</HI> Mi&s;s Howe; and by the &s;everity of her relations; which might but too probably have affected her head a little at times: Adding, that it was very generous in me to give way to the &s;torm, when it was up, ra|ther than to exa&s;perate at &s;uch a time.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, Sirs, &s;aid the widow Bevis, that is not what one hu&s;band in a thou&s;and would have done.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired, that <HI>no part of this conver&s;ation might be hinted to my &s;pou&s;e</HI>; and looked &s;till more ba&s;hfully. Her great fault, I mu&s;t own, was over-delicacy.</P>
<P>The Captain leered round him; and &s;aid, He be|lieved he could gue&s;s from the hints I had given him in town (of my <HI>over-love</HI>), and from what had now pa&s;&s;ed, that we had not con&s;ummated our marriage.</P>
<P>O Jack! how &s;heepi&s;hly then looked, or endea|voured to look, thy friend! how primly Goody Moore! how affectedly Mi&s;s Rawlins!&mdash;while the hone&s;t widow Bevis gazed around her fearle&s;s; and
<PB N="83" REF="84">
tho' only &s;impering with her mouth, her eyes laugh'd out-right, and &s;eem'd to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erv'd, that I was a phoenix of a man, if &s;o; and he could not but hope, that all matters would be happily accommodated in a day or two; and that then he &s;hould have the plea&s;ure to averr to her uncle, that he was pre&s;ent, as he might &s;ay, on our wed|ding-day.</P>
<P>The women &s;eem'd all to join in the &s;ame hope.</P>
<P>Ah, Captain! ah, Ladies!&mdash;how happy &s;hould I be, if I could bring my dear &s;pou&s;e to be of the &s;ame mind!</P>
<P>It would be a very happy conclu&s;ion of a very knotty affair, &s;aid widow Bevis; and I &s;ee not why we may not make this very night a merry one.</P>
<P>The Captain &s;uperciliou&s;ly &s;miled at me. He &s;aw plainly enough, he &s;aid, that we had been at <HI>chil|drens play</HI> hitherto. A man of my character mu&s;t have a prodigious value for his Lady, who could give way to &s;uch a caprice as This. But one thing he would venture to tell me; and that was This&mdash;That, however de&s;irous young &s;kitti&s;h Ladies might be to have their way in this particular, it was a very bad &s;etting-out for the man; as it gave his bride a very high proof of the power &s;he had over him: And he would engage, that no woman, <HI>thus</HI> humoured, ever valued the man the more for it; but very much the contrary&mdash;And there were <HI>rea&s;ons to be given why &s;he &s;hould not.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, Captain, no more of this &s;ubject be|fore the Ladies.&mdash;<HI>One</HI> feels (in a ba&s;hful <HI>try-to-blu&s;h</HI> manner, &s;hrugging my &s;houlders), that <HI>one</HI> is <HI>&s;o</HI> ridi|culous&mdash;I have been puni&s;h'd enough for my tender folly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins had taken her fan, and would needs
<PB N="84" REF="85">
hide her face behind it: I &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e her blu&s;h was not quite ready.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore hemm'd, and look'd down, and by that, gave hers over.</P>
<P>While the jolly widow, laughing out, prai&s;ed the Captain, as one of Hudibras's metaphy&s;icians, re|peating,
<Q><L>He knew what's what, and that's as high</L>
<L>As metaphy&s;ic wit can fly.</L></Q></P>
<P>This made Mi&s;s Rawlins blu&s;h indeed:&mdash;Fie, fie, Mrs. Bevis! cry'd &s;he, unwilling I &s;uppo&s;e, to be thought ab&s;olutely ignorant.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I began to think, that I had not made a bad exchange of our profe&s;&s;ing mother, for the un-profe&s;&s;ing Mrs. Moore. And indeed the women and I, and my Beloved too, all mean the &s;ame thing: We only differ about the manner of coming at the propo&s;ed end.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER VII.</HI> Mr. <HI>LOVELACE.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>IT was now high time to acquaint my &s;pou&s;e, that Captain Tomlin&s;on was come. And the rather, as the maid told us, that the lady had a&s;ked her, If &s;uch a gentleman (de&s;cribing him) was not in the parlour?</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore went up, and reque&s;ted, in my name, that &s;he would give us audience.</P>
<P>But &s;he return'd, with a de&s;ire, that Captain Tomlin&s;on would excu&s;e her for the pre&s;ent. She was very ill. Her &s;pirits were too weak to enter into conver&s;ation with him; and &s;he mu&s;t lie down.</P>
<P>I was vexed, and, at fir&s;t, extremely di&s;concerted.
<PB N="85" REF="86">
The Captain was vexed too. And my concern, thou may&s;t believe, was the greater on his account.</P>
<P>She had been very much fatigued, I own. Her fits in the morning mu&s;t have weaken'd her: And &s;he had carried her re&s;entment &s;o high, that it was the le&s;s wonder &s;he &s;hould find her&s;elf low, when her rai&s;ed &s;pirits had &s;ub&s;ided. <HI>Very</HI> low, I may &s;ay; if &s;inkings are proportioned to ri&s;ings; for &s;he had been lifted up above the &s;tandard of a common mortal.</P>
<P>The Captain, however, &s;ent up in his own name, that if he could be admitted to drink one di&s;h of tea with her, he &s;hould take it for a favour; and would go to town, and di&s;patch &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, to leave his morning free to attend her.</P>
<P>But &s;he pleaded a violent head-ach; and Mrs. Moore confirm'd the plea to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I would have had the Captain lodge there that night, as well in compliment to him, as introductory to my intention of entering my &s;elf upon my new-taken apartment. But his hours were of too much importance to him to &s;tay the evening.</P>
<P>It was indeed very inconvenient for him, he &s;aid, to return in the morning; but he was willing to do all in his power to heal this breach, and that as well for the &s;akes of me and my lady, as for that of his dear friend Mr. John Harlowe; who mu&s;t not know how far this mi&s;under&s;tanding had gone. He would therefore only drink one di&s;h of tea with the ladies and me.</P>
<P>And accordingly, after he had done &s;o, and I had had a little private conver&s;ation with him, he hurried away.</P>
<P>His fellow had given him, in the interim, a high character to Mrs. Moore's &s;ervants: And this re|ported by the Widow Bevis (who, being no proud woman, is <HI>hail fellow, well met,</HI> as the &s;aying is, with all her aunt's &s;ervants), he was a <HI>fine</HI> gentleman, a <HI>di&s;creet</HI> gentleman, a man of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>breeding,</HI> with
<PB N="86" REF="87">
them all: And it was pity, that, with &s;uch great bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands, he &s;hould be obliged to come again.</P>
<P>My life for yours, audibly whi&s;per'd the Widow Bevis, There is <HI>humour</HI> as well as <HI>head-ach</HI> in Some|body's declining to &s;ee this worthy gentleman.&mdash;Ah, Lord! how happy might &s;ome people be, if they would!&mdash;</P>
<P>No perfect happine&s;s in this world, &s;aid I, very gravely, and with a &s;igh; for the widow mu&s;t know that I heard her. If we have not <HI>real</HI> unhappine&s;s, we can make it, even from the overflowings of our own good fortune.</P>
<P>Very true, and, Very true, the two widows: A charming ob&s;ervation, Mrs. Bevis. Mi&s;s Rawlins &s;mil'd <HI>her</HI> a&s;&s;ent to it; and I thought &s;he call'd me in her heart, Charming man! For &s;he profe&s;&s;es to be a great admirer of moral ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I had hardly taken leave of the Captain, and &s;at down again with the women, when Will. came; and calling me out, 'Sir, Sir,' &s;aid he, grinning with a familiarity in his looks, as if what he had to &s;ay in|titled him to take liberties;
<Q>I have got the fellow down!&mdash;I have got old Grimes&mdash;Hah, hah, hah, hah&mdash;He is at the Lower-Fla&s;k&mdash;Almo&s;t in the condition of <HI>David's &s;ow,</HI> and plea&s;e your Honour &mdash;[The dog him&s;elf not much better] Here is his letter&mdash;from&mdash;from Mi&s;s Howe&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, ha,</Q>
laugh'd the varlet; holding it fa&s;t, as if to make conditions with me, and to excite my prai&s;es, as well as my impatience.</P>
<P>I could have knock'd him down; but he would have his <HI>&s;ay</HI> out&mdash;
<Q>Old Grimes knows not that I have the letter&mdash;I mu&s;t get back to him before he mi&s;&s;es it&mdash;I only made a pretence to go out for a few minutes&mdash;But&mdash;but</Q>
&mdash;and then the dog laugh'd
<PB N="87" REF="88">
again&mdash;
<Q>He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tay&mdash;Old Grimes <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tay&mdash;till I go back to pay the reckoning.</Q></P>
<P>D&mdash;n the prater!&mdash;Grinning ra&s;cal!&mdash;The letter &mdash;The letter!&mdash;</P>
<P>He gather'd in his <HI>wide mothe,</HI> as he calls it, and gave me the letter; but with a <HI>&s;trut,</HI> rather than a <HI>bow</HI>; and then &s;idled off like one of Widow Sorlings's dunghill cocks, exulting after a great feat performed. And all the time that I was holding up the billet to the light, to try to get at its contents, without break|ing the &s;eal (for, di&s;patch'd in a hurry, it had no cover), there &s;tood he laughing, &s;hrugging, playing off his legs; now &s;troking his &s;hining chin; now turning his hat upon his thumb; then leering in my face, flouri&s;hing with his head&mdash;O Chri&s;t! now-and-then cry'd the ra&s;cal&mdash;</P>
<P>What joy has this dog in mi&s;chief!&mdash;More than I can have in the completion of my mo&s;t favourite purpo&s;es!&mdash;The&s;e fellows are ever happier than their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I was once thinking to rumple up this billet till I had broken the &s;eal. <HI>Young</HI> families (Mi&s;s Howe's is not an antient one) love o&s;tentatious &s;ealings: And it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;queez'd in pieces, in old Grimes's breeches pocket. But I was glad to be <HI>&s;aved</HI> the guilt as well as &s;u&s;picion of having a hand in &s;o dirty a trick; for thus much of the contents (enough for my purpo&s;e) I was enabled to &s;cratch out in character, without it; the folds de|priving me only of a few connecting words; which I have &s;upply'd between hooks.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;s Harlowe, thou knowe&s;t, had <HI>before</HI> changed her name to <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Laetitia Beaumont. An|other <HI>alias</HI> now, Jack: I have learn'd her to be half a rogue in this in&s;tance; for this billet was directed to her by the name of <HI>Mrs.</HI> Harriot Lucas.</P>

<P>O Jack, what heart's-ea&s;e does this <HI>interception</HI> give me!&mdash;I &s;ent the ra&s;cal back with the letter to old Grimes, and charg'd him to drink no deeper. He own'd, that he was <HI>half &s;eas over,</HI> as he phra&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Dog! &s;aid I, are you not to court one of Mrs. Moore's maids to night?&mdash;</P>
<P>Cry your mercy, Sir!&mdash;I will be &s;ober.&mdash;I had forgot that&mdash;But old Grimes is plaguy tough&mdash;I thought I &s;hould never have got him down.</P>
<P>Away, villain!&mdash;Let old Grimes come; and on hor&s;eback, too, to the door&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;hall, and plea&s;e your Honour, if I can get him on the &s;addle, and if he can &s;it&mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="89" REF="90">Enough, Sir! familiarly nodding his head, to &s;hew he took me. And away went the villain: Into the parlour, among the women, I.</P>
<P>In a quarter of an hour came old Grimes on hor&s;e|back, waving to his &s;addle-bow, now on this &s;ide, now on that; his head, at others, joining to that of his more &s;ober bea&s;t.</P>
<P>It look'd very well to the women, that I made no effort to &s;peak to old Grimes (tho' I wi&s;h'd <HI>before them,</HI> that I knew the contents of what he brought); but, on the contrary, de&s;ired that they would in|&s;tantly let my &s;pou&s;e know, that her me&s;&s;enger was return'd.

<P>She took the letter from old Grimes with her own hands, and retired to an inner parlour to read it.</P>
<P>She pre&s;ently came out again to the fellow, who had much ado to &s;it his hor&s;e&mdash;Here is your money, friend. I thought you long. But what &s;hall I do to get &s;omebody to go to town immediately for me? I &s;ee <HI>you</HI> cannot.</P>
<P>Old Grimes took his money; let fall his hat in d'offing it; had it given him; and rode away; his eyes i&s;ing-gla&s;s, and &s;et in his head, as I &s;aw thro' the window; and in a manner &s;peechle&s;s; all his language hiccoughs. My dog need not have gone &s;o deep with this <HI>tough</HI> old Grimes.&mdash;But the ra&s;cal was in his kingdom with him.</P>
<P>The lady apply'd to Mrs. Moore: She matter'd not the price. Could a man and hor&s;e be engaged for her?&mdash;Only to go for a letter left for her, at one Mr. Wil&s;on's in Pall-mall.</P>
<P>A poor neighbour was hired. A hor&s;e procured for him. He had his directions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Mr. <HI>LOVELACE.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I Went up to my new-taken apartment, and fell to writing in character, as u&s;ual. I thought I had made good my quarters. But the cruel creature, un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="91" REF="92">
that I intended to take up my lodgings there, declared with &s;o much violence again&s;t it, that I was obliged to &s;ubmit, and to accept of another lodging, about twelve doors off, which Mrs. Moore recommended. And all the advantage I could ob|tain, was, that Will. unknown to my &s;pou&s;e, and for fear of a freak, &s;hould lie in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore, indeed, was unwilling to di&s;oblige <HI>either</HI> of us. But Mi&s;s Rawlins was of opinion, that nothing more ought to be allow'd me: And yet Mrs. Moore owned, that the refu&s;al was a &s;trange piece of tyranny to an hu&s;band, if I <HI>were</HI> an hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>I had a good mind to make Mi&s;s Rawlins &s;mart for it. Come and &s;ee Mi&s;s Rawlins, Jack&mdash;If thou like&s;t her, I'll get her for thee with a <HI>wet finger,</HI> as the &s;aying is!</P>
<P>The Widow Bevis indeed &s;tickled hard for me [An innocent or injur'd man will have friends every|where]. She &s;aid, That to <HI>bear much</HI> with &s;ome wives, was to be obliged to bear more: And I reflected, with a &s;igh, <HI>that tame &s;pirits mu&s;t always be impo&s;ed upon.</HI> And then, in my heart, I renew'd my vows of revenge upon this haughty and perver&s;e beauty.</P>
<P>The &s;econd fellow came back from town about nine o'clock, with Mi&s;s Howe's letter of Wedne&s;|day la&s;t.
<Q>Collins, <HI>it &s;eems,</HI> when he left it, had de&s;ired, that it might be &s;afely and &s;peedily de|livered into Mi&s;s Laetitia Beaumont's own hands. But Wil&s;on, under&s;tanding that neither &s;he nor I were in town [<HI>He could not know of our difference, thou mu&s;t think</HI>], re&s;olved to take care of it till our return, in order to give it into one of our own hands; and now deliver'd it to her me&s;&s;enger.</Q></P>
<P>This was told <HI>her.</HI> Wil&s;on, I doubt not, is in her favour upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">She took the letter with great eagerne&s;s, open'd it in a hurry [I am glad &s;he did: Yet, I believe, all was right] before Mrs. Moore, and Mrs. Bevis (Mi&s;s Rawlins was gone home); and &s;aid, She would not for the world, that I &s;hould have had that letter; for the &s;ake of her dear friend the writer; who had written to her very unea&s;ily about it.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t now parted with this hone&s;t widow. She called upon me at my new lodgings.

<P>Very true: How <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;he? &s;aid Mrs. Bevis, proud of knowing&mdash;nothing! But, for her part, &s;he de&s;ired no pre&s;ent. It was enough if &s;he could con|tribute to reconcile man and wife, and di&s;appoint mi&s;chief-makers. She doubted not, that &s;uch an en|vious

<P>I knew thou woulde&s;t be unea&s;y for me: But did not I tell thee, that I had provided for every thing?

Was it not ea&s;y then, thinke&s;t thou, to contrive a &s;horter letter out of a longer; and to copy the very words?</P>
<P>I can tell thee, it was &s;o well ordered, that, not being &s;u&s;pected to have been in my hands, it was not ea&s;y to find me out. Had it been my Beloved's hand, there would have been no imitating it, for &s;uch a length. Her delicate and even mind is &s;een in the very cut of her letters. Mi&s;s Howe's hand is no bad one; but is not &s;o equal and regular.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will perhaps think, that I have been too long &s;ilent. But I had begun two letters at different times &s;ince my la&s;t, and written a great deal each time; and with &s;pirit enough, I a&s;&s;ure you; incen&s;ed as I was again&s;t the abominable wretch you are with, particularly on reading yours of the 21&s;t of the pa&s;t month.</P>
<P>The FIRST I intended to keep open till I could give you &s;ome accounts of my proceedings with Mrs. Town&s;end. It was &s;ome days before I &s;aw her: And this intervenient &s;pace giving me time to reperu&s;e what I had written, I thought it proper to lay that a&s;ide, and to write in a &s;tyle a little le&s;s fervent; for you would have blamed me, I knew, for the freedom of &s;ome of my expre&s;&s;ions (execrations, if you plea&s;e). And when I had gone a good way in the SECOND, the change in your pro|&s;pects, on his communicating to you Mi&s;s Montague's letter, and his better behaviour, occa&s;ioning a change in your mind, I laid that a&s;ide al&s;o: And in this uncertainty thought I would wait to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of affairs between you, before I wrote again; believing that all would &s;oon be decided one way or other.&mdash;</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>Here I was forced to break off.</HI> I am <HI>too little</HI> my own mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash; My mother <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 329.</NOTE> always up and down; and watching as if I were writing to a fellow. What need I (&s;he a&s;ks me) lock my&s;elf in <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">p. 331.</NOTE>, if I am only reading pa&s;t corre&s;pondencies? For that is my pretence, when &s;he comes poking in with her face &s;harpen'd to an edge, as I may &s;ay, by a curio&s;ity, that gives her more pain than plea&s;ure&mdash;The Lord forgive me; but I believe I &s;hall huff her, next time &s;he comes in.</P>

<P>Do you forgive me too, my dear. My mother ought; becau&s;e &s;he &s;ays, I am my father's girl; and becau&s;e I am &s;ure I am hers.</P>
<P><HI>Upon my life, my dear, I am &s;ometimes of opinion, that this vile man was capable of meaning you di&s;honour. When I look back upon his pa&s;t conduct, I cannot help thinking &s;o: What a villain, if &s;o! &mdash;But now I hope, and verily believe, that he has laid a&s;ide &s;uch thoughts. My rea&s;ons for both opinions I will give you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the fir&s;t, to wit, that he had it once in his head to take you at advantage if he could; I con&s;ider</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">p. 336.</NOTE>, <HI>that</HI> pride, revenge, and a de|light to tread in unbeaten paths, are principal ingredients in the cha|racter of this fini&s;h'd libertine. He hates all your family, your&s;elf ex|cepted.&mdash;Yet is a &s;avage in love. His pride, and the credit which a few plau&s;ible qualities &s;prinkled among his odious ones, have given him, have &s;ecured him too good a reception from our eye-judging, our un|di&s;tingui&s;hing, our &s;elf-flattering, our too-confiding &s;ex, to make a&s;&s;iduity and ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and a conque&s;t of his unruly pa&s;&s;ions, any part of his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>He has &s;ome rea&s;on for his animo&s;ity to all the men, and to one woman, of your family. He has always &s;hewn you and his own family too, that he prefers his pride to his intere&s;t. He is a declared marriage-hater; a notorious intriguer; full of his inventions, and glorying in them. As his vanity had made him imagine, that no woman could be proof again&s;t his love, no wonder that he &s;truggled like a lion held in toils <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 337.</NOTE>, again&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion that he thought not returned <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE>, Hence, per|haps, it is not difficult to believe, that it became po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices again&s;t marriage; and to that revenge which had always been a fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion with him <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">p. 338.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>And hence may we account for</HI> his delays; his teazing ways; his bringing you to bear with his lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e; his making you pa&s;s to the people of it as his wife; his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions; the attempt of impo&s;ing upon you that Mi&s;s Partington for a bedfellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My rea&s;ons for the contrary opinion; to wit, that he is now re&s;olved to do you all the ju&s;tice in his power to do you</HI>; are the&s;e: That he &s;ees that all his own family <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">p. 340.</NOTE> have warmly engaged them&s;elves in your cau&s;e; that the horrid wretch loves you&mdash;With &s;uch a Love, <HI>however,</HI> as H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d loved his Mariamne: That, on inquiry, I find it to be true, that coun&s;ellor Williams (whom Mr. Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion) has actually as good as fini&s;hed the &s;ettle|ments: That two draughts of them have been made; one avowedly to be &s;ent to <HI>this very</HI> Captain Tomlin&s;on: And I find, that a licence has actually been more than once endeavoured to be obtained, and that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fficulties have hitherto been made equally to Lovelace's vexation and di&s;appointment. My mother's proctor, who is very intimate with the proctor apply'd to by the wretch, has come at this information, in confidence; and hints, that as Mr. Lovelace is a man of high fortunes, the&s;e difficulties will probably be got over.</P>
<P><HI>I had once re&s;olved to make &s;trict inquiry about Tomlin&s;on; and &s;till, if you will, your uncle's favourite hou&s;ekeeper may be &s;ounded, at di&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I know that the matter is &s;o laid</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">p. 333.</NOTE>, that Mrs. Hodges is &s;uppo&s;ed to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w nothing of the treaty &s;et on foot by means of Capt. Tomlin&s;on. But your uncle is an old man <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">p. 334.</NOTE>, and old men imagine them&s;elves to be under obligation to their paramours, if younger than them&s;elves, and &s;eldom keep any thing from their knowlege.&mdash;Yet, methinks, there can be no need; &s;ince Tomlin&s;on, as you de&s;cribe him, is &s;o good a man, and &s;o much of a gentleman; the end to be an&s;wered by his be|ing an impo&s;tor &s;o much more than nece&s;&s;ary, if Lovelace has villainy in his head.&mdash;And thus what he communicated to you of Mr. Hickman's application to your uncle, and of Mrs. Norton's to your mother (&s;ome of which particulars I am &s;atisfied his vile agent Jo&s;eph Leman could not reveal to his viler employer); his pu&s;hing on the marriage-day, in the name of your uncle; which it could not an&s;wer any wicked purpo&s;e for him to do; and what he writes of your uncle's propo&s;al, to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one hou&s;e together; and that to be made to agree with the time of Mr. Hickman's vi&s;it to your uncle; the in&s;i&s;ting on a tru&s;ty per&s;on's being pre&s;ent at the ceremony, at that uncle's nomina|tion&mdash;The&s;e things make me <HI>a&s;&s;ured that he now at la&s;t means ho|nourably.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But if any unexpected delays &s;hould happen on his &s;ide, acquaint me, my dear, of the very &s;treet where Mrs. Sinclair lives; and where Mrs. Fretchville's hou&s;e is &s;ituated (which I cannot find that you have ever mentioned in your former letters&mdash;which is a little odd); and I will make &s;trict inquiries of them, and of Tomlin&s;on too; and I will (if your heart will let you take my advice) &s;oon procure you a refuge from him with Mrs. Town&s;end.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But why do I now, when you &s;eem to be in &s;o good a train, puzzle and perplex you with my retro&s;pections? And yet they may be of u&s;e to you, if any delay happen on his part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But that I think cannot well be. What you have therefore now to do, is, &s;o to behave to this proud-&s;pirited wretch, as may bani&s;h from his mind all remembrance of</HI> pa&s;t di&s;obligations <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 341.</NOTE>, and to receive his ad|dre&s;&s;es, as tho&s;e of a betrothed lover. You will incur the cen&s;ure of prudery and affectation, if you keep him at that di&s;tance, which you have hitherto <HI>kept him at.</HI> His &s;udden (and as &s;uddenly recover'd) ill|ne&s;s has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him [Alas, my dear, I knew you loved him!]: He has &s;eemed to change his na|ture, and is all love and gentlene&s;s: <HI>And no more quarrels now, I be|&s;eech you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am very angry with him, neverthele&s;s, for the freedoms which he took with your per&s;on</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See p. 258, 259, 260.</NOTE>; <HI>and I think &s;ome guard is nece&s;&s;ary, as he is certainly an incroacher. But indeed all men are &s;o; and you are &s;uch a charming creature, and have kept him at &s;uch a di&s;tance! &mdash; But no more of this &s;ubject. Only, my dear, be not over-nice, now you are &s;o near the &s;tate. You &s;ee what difficulties you laid your&s;elf under,</HI> when Tomlin&s;on's letter called you again into <HI>the wretch's</HI> company.</P>
<P>If you meet with no impediments, no new cau&s;es of doubt <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">p. 342.</NOTE>, your reputation in the eye of the world is concerned, that you &s;hould be his, <HI>and, as your uncle rightly judges, be thought to have been his, before now.</HI> And yet, <HI>let me tell you,</HI> I can <HI>hardly</HI> bear <HI>to think,</HI> that the&s;e libertines &s;hould be rewarded for their villainy with the be&s;t of the &s;ex, when the wor&s;t of it are too good for them.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Howe might well be anxious about the letter &s;he wrote. Her &s;weet friend, from what I have let pa&s;s of hers, has rea&s;on to rejoice in the thought, that it fell not into my hands.</P>
<P>And now mu&s;t all my contrivances be &s;et at work, to intercept the expected letter from Mi&s;s Howe; which is, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to direct her to a place of &s;afety, and out of my knowlege. Mrs. Town&s;end is, no doubt, in this ca&s;e, to &s;muggle her off. I hope the <HI>villain,</HI> as I am &s;o frequently called between the&s;e two girls, will be able to manage this point.</P>
<P>But what, perhaps, thou a&s;ke&s;t, if the lady &s;hould take it into her head, by the connivance of Mi&s;s Raw|lins, to quit this hou&s;e privately in the night?</P>
<P>I have thought of this, Jack. Does not Will. lie in the hou&s;e? And is not the Widow Bevis my fa&s;t friend?</P>

<Q>The receipt of her double-dated letter in &s;afety: and referring to a longer let|ter, which &s;he intends to write, when &s;he &s;hall have a quieter heart, and le&s;s trembling fingers.

<P>I took great pains in writing this. It cannot, I hope, be &s;u&s;pected. Her hand is &s;o <HI>very</HI> delicate.

<P>I Am come back from Mrs. Moore's, whither I went in order to attend my charmer's commands. But no admittance. A very bad night.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s &s;he mu&s;t be as much concern'd, that &s;he has carried her re&s;entments &s;o very far, as I have rea&s;on to be, that I made &s;uch a poor u&s;e of the op|portunity I had on Wedne&s;day night.</P>
<P>But now, Jack, for a brief review of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and a &s;light hint or two of my precautions.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the women this morning, and find them half-right, half-doubting.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">Mi&s;s Rawlins's brother tells her, that &s;he <HI>lives</HI> at Mrs. Moores's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore can do nothing without Mi&s;s Raw|lins.</P>
<P>People who keep lodgings at public places expect to get by every one who comes into their purlieus. Tho' not permitted to lodge there my&s;elf, I have engag'd all the rooms &s;he has to &s;pare, to the very gar|rets; and <HI>that,</HI> as I have told thee before, for a month certain, and at her own price, board included; my &s;pou&s;e's and all: But &s;he mu&s;t not, at pre&s;ent, know it. So I hope I have Mrs. Moore fa&s;t <HI>by the intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This, devil-like, is &s;uiting temptations to in|clinations.</P>
<P>I have always ob&s;erved, and, I believe, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inted as much formerly <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 172.</NOTE>, that all dealers, tho' but for pins, may be taken in by cu&s;tomers for pins, &s;ooner than by a direct bribe of ten times the value; e&s;pecially if pretenders to con&s;cience: For the offer of a bribe, would not only give room for &s;u&s;picion; but would &s;tartle and alarm their &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s; while a high price paid for what you buy, is but &s;ub|mitting to be cheated in the method the per&s;on makes a profe&s;&s;ion to get by. Have I not &s;aid, that human nature is a rogue <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 177. <HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 17.</NOTE>?&mdash;And do not I know it?</P>
<P>To give a higher in&s;tance, How many proud &s;ena|tors, in the year 1720, were induced, by pre&s;ents or &s;ub&s;criptions of South Sea &s;tock, to contribute to a &s;cheme big with national ruin; who yet would have &s;purn'd the man who &s;hould have pre&s;umed to offer them even twice the &s;um certain, that they had a chance to gain by the &s;tock?&mdash;But to return to my <HI>review,</HI> and my <HI>precautions.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins fluctuates as &s;he hears the lady's &s;tory, or as &s;he hears mine. Somewhat of an infi|del, I doubt, is this Mi&s;s Rawlins. I have not yet
<PB N="102" REF="103">
con&s;ider'd <HI>her</HI> foible. The next time I &s;ee her, I will take particular notice of all the moles and freckles in her mind; and then <HI>infer</HI> and <HI>apply.</HI></P>
<P>The Widow Bevis, as I have told thee, is all my own.</P>
<P>My man Will. lies in the hou&s;e. My other new fellow attends upon <HI>me</HI>; and cannot therefore be quite &s;tupid.</P>
<P>Already is Will. over head and ears in love with one of Mrs. Moore's maids. He was &s;truck with her the moment he &s;et his eyes upon her. A raw country wench too. But all women, from the counte&s;s to the cookmaid, are put into high good humour with them&s;elves, when a man is taken with them at fir&s;t &s;ight. Be they ever &s;o <HI>plain</HI> [No woman can be <HI>ugly,</HI> Jack!], they'll find twenty good rea&s;ons, be&s;ides the great one, for <HI>Sake's &s;ake,</HI> by the help of the gla&s;s without (and perhaps in &s;pite of it), and conceit within, to ju&s;tify the hone&s;t fellow's <HI>caption.</HI></P>
<P>"The rogue has &s;aved 150 l. in my &s;ervice"&mdash; More by 50 than I bid him &s;ave. No doubt he thinks he <HI>might</HI> have done &s;o; tho', I believe, not worth a groat.
<Q>The be&s;t of ma&s;ters I&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ionate, indeed: But &s;oon appea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>The wench is extremely kind to him already. The other maid is al&s;o very civil to him. He has a hu&s;|band for <HI>her</HI> in his eye. She cannot but &s;ay, that Mr. Andrew, my <HI>other</HI> &s;ervant [The girl is for fixing the <HI>per&s;on</HI>] is a very well-&s;poken civil young man.</P>
<P><Q>We common folks have our joys, and plea&s;e your Honour, &s;ays hone&s;t Jo&s;eph Leman, like as our betters have <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 231.</NOTE>.</Q>
And true &s;ays hone&s;t Jo|&s;eph&mdash;Did I prefer ea&s;e to difficulty, I &s;hould envy the&s;e low-degree &s;inners &s;ome of their joys.</P>
<P>But if Will. had <HI>not</HI> made amorous preten&s;ions to the wenches, we all know, that &s;ervants, united in
<PB N="103" REF="104">
one common <HI>compare-note</HI> cau&s;e, are intimate the moment they &s;ee one another&mdash;Great genealogi&s;ts too; they know immediately the whole kin and kin's kin of each other, tho' di&s;per&s;ed over the three king|doms, as well as the genealogies and kin's kin of tho&s;e they &s;erve.</P>
<P>But my precautions end not here.</P>
<P>O Jack, with &s;uch an invention, what occa&s;ion had I to carry my Beloved to Mrs. Sinclair's?</P>
<P>My &s;pou&s;e may have further occa&s;ion for the me&s;|&s;engers whom &s;he di&s;patch'd, one to Mi&s;s Howe, the other to Wil&s;on's. With one of the&s;e Will. is al|ready well-acquainted, as thou ha&s;t heard&mdash;To mingle liquor is to mingle &s;ouls with the&s;e fellows: With the other he will &s;oon be acquainted, if he be not <HI>al|ready.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain's &s;ervant has <HI>his</HI> u&s;es and in&s;tructions a&s;&s;ign'd him. I have hinted at &s;ome of them al|ready <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Page <HI>85</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>. <HI>He</HI> al&s;o &s;erves a mo&s;t humane and con|&s;iderate ma&s;ter. I love to make every-body re&s;pected to my power.</P>
<P>The po&s;t, general and peny, will be &s;trictly watch'd likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe's Collins is remember'd to be de|&s;cribed. Mi&s;s Howe's and Hickman's liveries al&s;o.</P>
<P>James Harlowe and Singleton are warned again&s;t. I am to be acquainted with any inquiry that &s;hall happen to be made after my &s;pou&s;e, whether by her married or maiden name, before <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;hall be told of it&mdash;And this that I may have it in my power to <HI>prevent mi&s;chief.</HI></P>
<P>I have order'd Mowbray and Tourville (and Belton, if his health permit) to take their quarters at Ham|&s;tead for a week, with their fellows to attend them. I &s;pare thee for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e of thy private
<PB N="104" REF="105">
concerns. But hold thy&s;elf in chearful readine&s;s however, as a mark of thy <HI>allegiance.</HI></P>
<P>As to my &s;pou&s;e her&s;elf, has &s;he not rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with me, for having permitted her to receive Mi&s;s Howe's letter from Wil&s;on's? A plain ca&s;e, either that I am no deep plotter, or that I have no further views but to make my peace with her, for an offence &s;o &s;light, and &s;o <HI>accidental.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe &s;ays, tho' prefaced with an <HI>alas!</HI> that her charming friend loves me: She mu&s;t therefore yearn after this reconciliation&mdash;Pro&s;pects &s;o fair&mdash;If &s;he u&s;ed me with le&s;s rigor, and more politene&s;s; if &s;he &s;hewed me any <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI>; &s;eemed inclinable to &s;pare me, and to make the mo&s;t favourable con&s;tructions; I cannot but &s;ay, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;hew <HI>her</HI> &s;ome. But to be in&s;ulted and defied by a rebel in one's power, what prince can bear that?</P>
<P>But I return to the &s;cene of action. I mu&s;t keep the women &s;teady. I had no opportunity to talk to my worthy Mrs. Bevis in private.</P>
<P>Tomlin&s;on, a dog, not come yet!</P>

<P>MISS Rawlins at her brother's; Mrs. Moore en|gaged in hou&s;hold matters; Widow Bevis dre&s;&s;ing; I have nothing to do but write. This cur&s;ed Tomlin&s;on not yet arrived! Nothing to be done without him.</P>
<P>I think he &s;hall complain in pretty high language of the treatment he met with ye&s;terday.
<Q>What are our affairs to him? He can have no view but to &s;erve us. Cruel, to &s;end back to town, <HI>un|audienced,</HI> un&s;een, a man of his bu&s;ine&s;s and im|portance.
<PB N="105" REF="106">
He never &s;tirs a foot, but &s;omething of con&s;equence depends upon his movements. A confounded thing to trifle thus humour&s;omely with &s;uch a gentleman's moments! &mdash; The&s;e women think, that all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till for their <HI>figaries</HI> [A good female word, Jack!]: The greate&s;t triflers in the creation, to fancy them|&s;elves the mo&s;t important beings in it&mdash;<HI>Marry come up!</HI> as I have heard Goody Sorlings &s;ay to her &s;er|vants, when &s;he has rated at them, with mingled anger and di&s;dain.</Q></P>

<P>What bryars and thorns does the wretch ru&s;h into (a &s;cratch'd face and tatter'd garments the unavoid|able con&s;equence), who will needs be for &s;triking out a new path thro' overgrown underwood; quitting <HI>that</HI> beaten out for him by tho&s;e who have travelled the &s;ame road before him!</P>

<P>A VISIT from the Widow Bevis, in my own apart|ment. She tells me, that my &s;pou&s;e had thoughts la&s;t night, after I was gone to my lodgings, of re|moving from Mrs. Moore's. I almo&s;t wi&s;h &s;he had attempted to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins, it &s;eems, who was apply'd to upon it, di&s;&s;uaded her from it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore al&s;o, tho' &s;he did not own that Will. lay in the hou&s;e (or rather &s;at up in it, courting), &s;et before her the difficulties, which, in her opinion, &s;he would have to get clear off, without my know|lege; a&s;&s;uring her, that &s;he could be no-where &s;afer
<PB N="106" REF="107">
than with her, till &s;he had fixed whither to go. And the lady her&s;elf recollected, that if &s;he went, &s;he might mi&s;s the expected letter from her dear friend Mi&s;s Howe; which, as &s;he owned, was to direct her future &s;teps.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t al&s;o &s;urely have &s;ome curio&s;ity to know what her uncle's friend had to &s;ay to her from her uncle, contemptuou&s;ly as &s;he ye&s;terday treated a man of his importance. Nor could &s;he, I &s;hould think, be ab&s;olutely determin'd to put her&s;elf out of the way of receiving the vi&s;its of two of the principal ladies of my family, and to break intirely with me in the face of them all.&mdash;Be&s;ides, whither could &s;he have gone?&mdash;Moreover, Mi&s;s Howe's letter coming, after her elopement, &s;o &s;afely to her hands, mu&s;t &s;urely put her into a more confiding temper with me, and with every one el&s;e, tho' &s;he would not imme|diately own it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e good folks have &s;o <HI>little</HI> charity!&mdash;Are &s;uch <HI>&s;evere</HI> cen&s;urers!&mdash;Yet who is <HI>ab&s;olutely per|fect?</HI>&mdash;It were to be wi&s;hed, however, that <HI>they</HI> would be &s;o mode&s;t as to doubt them&s;elves &s;ome|times: Then would they allow for others, as others (excellent as they imagine them&s;elves to be) mu&s;t for them.</P>

<P>TOMLINSON at la&s;t is come. Forced to ride five miles about (tho' I &s;hall impute his delay to great and important bu&s;ine&s;s) to avoid the &s;ight of two or three impertinent ra&s;cals, who, little thinking who&s;e affairs he was employ'd in, wanted to obtrude them&s;elves upon him. I think I will make this fel|low ea&s;y, if he behave to my liking in this affair.</P>
<P>I &s;ent up the moment he came.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed receiving his vi&s;it till four this afternoon.</P>
<P><HI>Intolerable!</HI>&mdash;No con&s;ideration!&mdash;None at all in

<P>The Captain is in a pet. Who can blame him? Even the women think a man of his con&s;equence, and generou&s;ly coming to &s;erve us, hardly u&s;ed. Would to heaven &s;he had attempted to get off la&s;t night: The women not my enemies, who knows but the hu&s;band's exerted authority might have met with &s;uch connivance, as might have concluded ei|ther in carrying her back to her former lodgings, or in con&s;ummation at Mrs. Moore's, in &s;pite of excla|mations, fits, and the re&s;t of the female ob&s;ecra|tions?</P>
<P>My beloved has not appeared to any-body this day, except to Mrs. Moore. Is, it &s;eems, extremely low: Unfit for the intere&s;ting conver&s;ation that is to be held in the afternoon. Longs to hear from her dear friend Mi&s;s Howe&mdash;Yet cannot expect a letter for a day or two. Has a bad opinion of all man|kind.&mdash;No wonder!&mdash;Excellent creature as &s;he is! with &s;uch a <HI>father,</HI> &s;uch <HI>uncles,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>brother,</HI> as &s;he has!</P>
<P>How does &s;he look?</P>
<P>Better than could be expected from ye&s;terday's fa|tigue, and la&s;t night's ill re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e tender doves know not, till put to it, what they can bear; e&s;pecially when engaged in love-affairs; and their attention wholly engro&s;&s;ed. But the &s;ex love bu&s;y &s;cenes. Still-life is their aver&s;ion. A woman will <HI>create</HI> a &s;torm, rather than be without one. So as they can pre&s;ide in the whirlwind, and direct it, they are happy.&mdash;But my beloved's mi&s;|fortune is, that &s;he mu&s;t live in tumults; yet neither rai&s;e them her&s;elf, nor be able to controul them.</P>

<P>The conver&s;ation between the Captain and the Lady, when we were retired, was to the following effect: They both talked loud enough for me to hear them. The Lady from anger, the Captain with de|&s;ign; and, thou may&s;t be &s;ure, there was no li&s;tener but my&s;elf. What I was imperfect in was &s;upply'd afterwards; for I had my vellom-leav'd book, to note all down.&mdash;If &s;he had known this, perhaps &s;he would have been more &s;paring of her invectives&mdash; and but <HI>perhaps</HI> neither.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116">He told her, that as her brother was ab&s;olutely re|&s;olved to &s;ee her; and as he him&s;elf, in compliance with her uncle's expedient, had reported her mar|riage; and as that report had reached the ears of Lord M. Lady Betty, and the re&s;t of my relations; and as he had been obliged, in con&s;equence of his fir&s;t report, to vouch it; and as her brother might find out where &s;he was, and apply to the women here, for a confirmation or refutation of the mar|riage; he had thought him&s;elf obliged to countenance the report before the women: That this had em|bara&s;&s;ed him not a little, as he would not for the world that &s;he &s;hould have cau&s;e to think him capa|ble of prevarication, contrivance, or double-dealing: And that this made him de&s;irous of a private conver|&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>It was true, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he <HI>had</HI> given her con&s;ent to &s;uch an expedient, believing it was her <HI>uncle</HI>'s; and little thinking, that it would lead to &s;o many er|rors. Yet &s;he might have known, that one error is frequently the parent of many. Mr. Lovelace had made her &s;en&s;ible of the truth of that ob&s;ervation, on more occa&s;ions than one; and it was an ob&s;ervation that he the Captain had made, in one of the letters that was &s;hewn her ye&s;terday <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Page <HI>37.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He hoped, that &s;he had no mi&s;tru&s;t of <HI>him.</HI> That &s;he had no doubts of <HI>his honour.</HI> If, Madam, you &s;u&s;pect me&mdash;If you think me capable&mdash;What a man&mdash; The Lord be merciful to me!&mdash;What a man mu&s;t you think me!</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, there cannot be a man in the world, who could de&s;erve to be &s;u&s;pected in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this. I do <HI>not</HI> &s;u&s;pect you. If it were po&s;&s;ible there could be <HI>one</HI> &s;uch man, I am &s;ure, Capt. Tomlin&s;on, a father of children, a man in years, of &s;en&s;e and experience, cannot be that man.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">He told me, that ju&s;t then, he thought he felt a &s;udden fla&s;h from her eye, an <HI>eye-beam,</HI> as he called it, dart thro' his &s;hivering reins; and he could not help trembling.</P>
<P>The dog's con&s;cience, Jack! Nothing el&s;e!&mdash;I have felt half a dozen &s;uch fla&s;hes, &s;uch eye-beams, in as many different conver&s;ations with this &s;oul-piercing beauty.</P>
<P>Her uncle, &s;he mu&s;t own, was not accu&s;tom'd to think of &s;uch expedients: But &s;he had reconciled this to her&s;elf, as the ca&s;e was unhappily uncommon; and by the regard he had for her honour.</P>
<P>This &s;et the puppy's heart at ea&s;e, and gave him more courage.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked him, If he thought Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Montague intended her a vi&s;it?</P>
<P>He had no doubt but they did.</P>
<P>And does he imagine, &s;aid &s;he, that I could be brought to countenance to them the report you have given out?</P>
<P>[<HI>I had hoped to bring her to this, Jack, or &s;he had not &s;een their letters.</HI> But I had told the Captain, that I believe I mu&s;t give up this expectation.]</P>
<P>No. He believed, that I had not &s;uch a thought. He was pretty &s;ure, that I intended, when I &s;aw <HI>them,</HI> to tell them (as in confidence) the naked truth.</P>
<P>He then told her, that her uncle had already made &s;ome &s;teps towards a general reconciliation. The mo|ment, Madam, that he knows you are really married, he will enter into conference with your <HI>father</HI> upon it; having actually expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire to be reconciled to you, to your <HI>mother.</HI></P>
<P>And what, Sir, &s;aid my mother? What &s;aid my <HI>dear</HI> mother? [with great emotion; holding out her &s;weet face, as the Captain de&s;cribed her, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t attention, as if &s;he would &s;horten

the way which his words were to have to her heart.]</P>
<P>Your mother, Madam, bur&s;t into tears upon it: And your uncle was &s;o penetrated by <HI>her</HI> tenderne&s;s, that he could not proceed with the &s;ubject. But he intends to enter upon it with her in form, as &s;oon as he hears that the ceremony is over.</P>
<P>By the tone of her voice &s;he wept. The dear creature, thought I, begins to relent!&mdash;And I grudg'd the dog his eloquence. I could hardly bear the thought, that any man breathing &s;hould have the power, which I had lo&s;t, of per&s;uading this high-&s;oul'd lady, tho' in my own favour. And, would&s;t thou think it? this reflection gave me more unea&s;ine&s;s at the mo|ment, than I felt from her reproaches, violent as they were; or than I had plea&s;ure in her &s;uppo&s;ed relenting. For there is beauty in every-thing &s;he &s;ays and does: Beauty in her pa&s;&s;ion: Beauty in her tears!&mdash;Had the Captain been a young fellow, and of rank and fortune, his throat would have been in dan|ger; and I &s;hould have thought very hardly of her!</P>
<P>O Capt. Tomlin&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, you know not what I have &s;uffer'd by this man's &s;trange ways. He had, as I was not a&s;hamed to tell him ye&s;terday, a <HI>plain path before him.</HI> He at fir&s;t betray'd me into his power: But when I <HI>was</HI> in it&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.

<P>Mr. Tomlin&s;on, I have heard a great part of what has pa&s;&s;ed between you and this unforgiving, however otherwi&s;e excellent lady. I am cut to the heart to find the dear creature &s;o determined. I could not have believed it po&s;&s;ible, with &s;uch pro&s;pects, that I had &s;o little a &s;hare in her e&s;teem. Never|thele&s;s I mu&s;t do my&s;elf ju&s;tice with regard to the offence I was &s;o unhappy as to give, &s;ince I find you are ready to think it much greater than it really was.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear not, Sir, your recapitulations. I am, and ought to be, the &s;ole judge of in&s;ults offered to my per&s;on. I enter not into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with you, nor hear you on the &s;hocking &s;ubject. And was going.</P>
</SP>
<P>I put my&s;elf between her and the door&mdash;You <HI>may</HI> hear all I have to &s;ay, Madam. My <HI>fault</HI> is not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a nature, but that you <HI>may.</HI> I will be a ju&s;t accu&s;er of my&s;elf; and will not wound your ears.</P>
<P>I then prote&s;ted that the fire was a real fire [So it was]. I di&s;claimed [le&s;s truly indeed] premedita|tion. I owned that I was hurried on by the vio|lence of a youthful pa&s;&s;ion, and by a &s;udden impul&s;e,
<PB N="121" REF="122">
which few other per&s;ons, in the like &s;ituation, would have been able to check: That I withdrew, at her command and intreaty, on the promi&s;e of <HI>pardon,</HI> without having offered the lea&s;t indecency, or any freedom, that would not have been forgiven by per|&s;ons of delicacy, &s;urpri&s;ed in an attitude &s;o charm|ing&mdash;Her terror, on the alarm of fire, calling for a &s;oothing behaviour, and per&s;onal tenderne&s;s, &s;he be|ing ready to fall into fits: My hoped-for happy day &s;o near, that I might be pre&s;umed to be looked upon as a betrothed lover&mdash;And that this excu&s;e might be pleaded even for the women of the hou&s;e, that they, thinking us actually married, might &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves to be the le&s;s concerned to interfere on &s;o ten|der an occa&s;ion&mdash;There, Jack, was a bold in&s;inua|tion in behalf of the women!</P>
<P>High indignation filled her di&s;dainful eye, eye-beam after eye-beam fla&s;hing at me. Every feature of her &s;weet face had &s;oul in it. Yet &s;he &s;poke not. Perhaps, Jack, &s;he had a thought, that this <HI>plea for the women</HI> accounted for my contrivance to have her pa&s;s to them as married, when I <HI>fir&s;t carried her thither.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that you did not well to add to the apprehen&s;ions of a lady &s;o much terrified before.</P>
</SP>
<P>She offer'd to go by me. I &s;et my back again&s;t the door, and be&s;ought her to &s;tay a few moments. I had not &s;aid thus much, my deare&s;t creature, but for your &s;ake, as well as for my own, that Captain Tomlin&s;on &s;hould not think I had been viler than I was. Nor will I &s;ay one word more on the &s;ubject, after I have appealed to your own heart, whether it was not nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o much; and to the Captain, whether otherwi&s;e he would not have gone away with a much wor&s;e opinion of me, if he

<P>That cau&s;e mu&s;t be well tried, where the of|fender takes his &s;eat upon the &s;ame bench with the judge.&mdash;I &s;ubmit not mine to men&mdash;Nor, give me leave to &s;ay, to You, Captain Tomlin&s;on, tho' I am willing to have a good opinion of you.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am <HI>influenced,</HI> as you call it, Ma|dam, is for the &s;ake of your uncle, and for your own &s;ake, more (I will &s;ay to Mr. Lovelace's face) than for his. What can I have in view, but peace and reconciliation? I have, from the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> blamed, and I now, <HI>again,</HI> blame, Mr. Lovelace, for adding di&s;tre&s;s to di&s;tre&s;s, and terror to terror; the lady, as you acknowlege, Sir

ready <HI>before</HI> to fall into fits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me own to you, Captain Tomlin&s;on, that I have been a very faulty, a very fooli&s;h man; and, if this dear creature <HI>ever</HI> honoured me with her love, an <HI>ingrateful</HI> one. But I have had too much rea&s;on to doubt it. And this is now a flagrant proof that &s;he never had the value for me which my proud heart wi&s;hed for, that, with &s;uch pro&s;pects before us; a day &s;o near; &s;ettlements approved and drawn; her uncle mediating a reconciliation, which, for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, not <HI>my own,</HI> I was de&s;irous to give into; &s;he can, for an offence &s;o <HI>really</HI> &s;light, on an occa&s;ion &s;o <HI>truly</HI> accidental, renounce me for ever; and, with me, all hopes of that reconciliation in the way her uncle had put it in, and &s;he had acquie&s;ced with; and
<PB N="123" REF="124">
ri&s;que all con&s;equences, fatal ones as they may too po&s;&s;ibly be.&mdash;By my &s;oul, Captain Tomlin&s;on, the dear creature mu&s;t have hated me all the time &s;he was intending to honour me with her hand. And now &s;he mu&s;t re&s;olve to abandon me, as far as I know, with a preference in her heart of the mo&s;t odi|ous of men&mdash;in favour of <HI>that Solmes,</HI> who, as you tell me, accompanies her brother: And with what hopes, with what view, accompanies him?&mdash;How can I bear to think of this?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is fit, Sir, that you &s;hould judge of my re|gard for you, by your own con&s;cious demerits. Yet you know, or you would not have dared to behave to me as &s;ometimes you did, that you had more of it than you de&s;erved.</P>
</SP>
<P>She walked from us; and then returning, Captain Tomlin&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, I will own to you, that I was not capable of re&s;olving to give my <HI>hand,</HI> and&mdash;<HI>no|thing but my hand.</HI>&mdash;Have I not given a flagrant proof of this to the once mo&s;t indulgent of parents? which has brought me into a di&s;tre&s;s, which this man has heightened, when he ought, in gratitude and ho|nour, to have endeavoured to render it &s;upportable. I had even a <HI>byas,</HI> Sir, in his favour, I &s;cruple not to own it. Long, too long! bore I with his unac|countable ways, attributing his errors to unmeaning gaiety, and to a want of knowing what true deli|cacy, and true genero&s;ity, required from a heart &s;u&s;|ceptible of grateful impre&s;&s;ions to one involved by his means in unhappy circum&s;tances. It is now <HI>wick|edne&s;s</HI> in him (a wickedne&s;s which di&s;credits all his <HI>profe&s;&s;ions</HI>) to &s;ay, that his la&s;t cruel and ingrateful in&s;ult was not a <HI>premeditated</HI> one.&mdash;But what need I &s;ay more of this in&s;ult, when it was of &s;uch a nature, that it has changed that byas in his favour, and made me choo&s;e to forego all the inviting pro&s;pects he
<PB N="124" REF="125">
talks of, and to run all hazards, to free my&s;elf from his power?</P>
<P>O my deare&s;t creature! how happy for us both, had I been able to <HI>di&s;cover that byas,</HI> as you conde|&s;cend to call it, thro' &s;uch re&s;erves as man never en|countered with!&mdash;</P>
<P>He did <HI>di&s;cover</HI> it, Captain Tomlin&s;on. He brought me, <HI>more than once, to own it</HI>; the more needle&s;ly brought me to own it, as I dare &s;ay his own <HI>vanity</HI> gave him <HI>no cau&s;e to doubt it</HI>; and as I had no other motive in not being <HI>forward</HI> to own it, than my too ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of his want of genero&s;ity. In a word, Captain Tomlin&s;on (and now, that I am de|termined upon my mea&s;ures, I the le&s;s &s;cruple to &s;ay it), I &s;hould have de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf, had I found my|&s;elf capable of affectation or tyranny to the man I in|tended to marry. I have always blamed the deare&s;t friend I have in the world for a fault of this nature. In a word&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And had my angel really and indeed the favour for me &s;he is plea&s;ed to own?&mdash;Deare&s;t crea|ture, forgive me. Re&s;tore me to your good opinion. Surely I have not &s;inned beyond forgivene&s;s. You &s;ay, that I extorted from you the promi&s;e you made me. But I could not have pre&s;umed to make that promi&s;e the condition of my obedience, had I not thought there was room to expect forgivene&s;s. Per|mit, I be&s;eech you, the pro&s;pects to take place, that were opening &s;o agreeably before us. I will go to town, and bring the licence. All difficulties to the obtaining of it are &s;urmounted. Captain Tomlin&s;on &s;hall be witne&s;s to the deeds. He will be pre&s;ent at the ceremony on the part of your uncle. Indeed he gave me hope, that your uncle him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>did,</HI> Mr. Lovelace: And I will tell you my grounds for the hope I gave. I propo&s;ed to my

dear friend (Your uncle, Madam), that he &s;hould give out, that he would take a turn with me to my little farm-hou&s;e, as I call it, near Northampton, for a week or &s;o.&mdash;Poor gentleman! he has of late been very little abroad! Too vi&s;ibly indeed decline|ing!&mdash;Change of air, it might be given out, was good for him.&mdash;But I &s;ee, Madam, that this is too <HI>tender</HI> a &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>The dear creature wept. She knew how to ap|ply, as meant, the Captain's hint to the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of her uncle's declining &s;tate of health.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We might indeed, I told him, &s;et out in that road, but turn &s;hort to town <HI>in my chariot</HI>; and he might &s;ee the ceremony performed with his own eyes, and be the de&s;ired father, as well as the be|loved uncle.</P>
</SP>
<P>She turned from us, and wiped her eyes.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, really, there &s;eem now to be but two objections to this; as Mr. Harlowe di&s;couraged not the propo&s;al&mdash;The one, the unhappy mi&s;under&s;tand|ing between you; which I would not by any means he &s;hould know; &s;ince then he might be apt to give weight to Mr. James Harlowe's unju&s;t &s;urmizes.&mdash; The other, that it would nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion &s;ome delay to the ceremony; which I cannot &s;ee, but may be performed in a day or two&mdash;If&mdash;</P>

<P>And then he reverently bowed to my godde&s;s. &mdash; Charming fellow!&mdash;But often did I cur&s;e my &s;tars, for making me &s;o much obliged to his adroitne&s;s.</P>
<P>She was going to &s;peak; but, not liking the turn of her countenance (altho', as I thought, its &s;everity and indignation &s;eemed a little abated), I &s;aid, and had like to have blown my&s;elf up by it&mdash;One expe|dient I have ju&s;t thought of&mdash;</P>

<P>The women all three came in, led by that ever-curious Mi&s;s Rawlins. I told them, that the lady was gone up to con&s;ider of every-thing: That we had hopes of her.

<P>Mrs. Bevis pre&s;ently return'd with an an&s;wer (winking and pinking at me), that the lady would follow her down. Mi&s;s Rawlins could not but offer to retire, as the others did.

Never man, in the like circum&s;tances, and re&s;olved as I was re&s;olved, goaded on as I was goaded on, as well by her own &s;ex, as by the impul&s;es of a violent pa&s;&s;ion, was ever &s;o decent.

<P>Now, Jack, this pitiful dog was &s;uch another un|fortunate one as thy&s;elf&mdash;His arguments &s;erving to confirm me in the very purpo&s;e, he brought them to prevail upon me to give up. Had he left me to my|&s;elf, to the tenderne&s;s of my own nature, moved as I was when the lady withdrew, and had &s;at down, and made odious faces, and &s;aid nothing; it is very po&s;&s;ible, that I &s;hould have taken the chair over-again&s;t him, which &s;he had quitted; and have cry'd

<P>Thou perhaps, in this place, would&s;t have urged the &s;ame pleas that he urged. What I an&s;wer'd to him therefore may do for thee, and &s;pare thee the trouble of writing, and me of reading, a good deal of non|&s;en&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS debate between the Captain and me, was hardly over, when the three women, led by Mi&s;s Rawlins, enter'd, hoping, No intru&s;ion&mdash;But very de&s;irous, the maiden &s;aid, to know if we were likely to accommodate.</P>
<P>O yes, I hope &s;o. You know, ladies, that your Sex mu&s;t, in the&s;e ca&s;es, pre&s;erve their forms. They mu&s;t be courted to comply with their own happine&s;s. A lucky expedient, we have hit upon. The uncle has his doubts of our marriage. He cannot believe, nor will any-body, that it is po&s;&s;ible that a man &s;o much in love, the lady &s;o de&s;irable &mdash;</P>
<P>They all took the hint&mdash;It was a very extraordi|nary ca&s;e, the two widows allowed. Women, Jack, as I believe I have ob&s;erved el&s;ewhere, have a high opinion of what they can do for us.&mdash;Mi&s;s Rawlins de&s;ired, if I plea&s;ed, to let them know the expe|dient; and look'd as if there was no need to proceed in the re&s;t of my &s;peech.</P>
<P>I begg'd, that they would not let the lady know that I had told them what this expedient was.</P>
<P>They promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was this: That to oblige and &s;atisfy Mr. Har|lowe, the ceremony was to be again performed. He was to be privately pre&s;ent, and to give his niece to me with his own hands&mdash;And &s;he was retired to con&s;ider of it.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, that I have provided an excu&s;e, to &s;ave my veracity to the women here, in ca&s;e I
<PB N="146" REF="147">
&s;hould incline to marriage, and &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e to have Mi&s;s Rawlins's a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the ceremony. Nor doubted I to bring my Fair-one to &s;ave my credit on this occa&s;ion, if I could get her to con&s;ent to be mine.</P>
<P>A charming expedient! cried the widow. They were all three ready to clap their hands for joy upon it. Women love to be married twice at lea&s;t, Jack; tho' not indeed to the <HI>&s;ame man</HI>; and all ble&s;s'd the reconciliatory &s;cheme, and the propo&s;er of it; and, &s;uppo&s;ing it came from the Captain, they look'd at him with plea&s;ure, while his face &s;hined with the ap|plau&s;e implied. He &s;hould think him&s;elf very happy, if he could bring about a general reconciliation; and he flouri&s;h'd with his head like my man Will. on his victory over old Grimes; bridling by turns, like Mi&s;s Rawlins in the height of a prudi&s;h fit.</P>
<P>But now it was time for the Captain to think of returning to town, having a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch before morning: Nor was he certain that he &s;hould again be able to attend us at Ham&s;tead be|fore he went home.</P>
<P>And yet I did not intend that he &s;hould leave Hamp&s;tead this night: Every thing drawing on to a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age to the above effect was carried up, at my de&s;ire, by Mrs. Moore; with the Captain's com|pliments, and to know if &s;he had any commands for him to her uncle?</P>
<P>But I hinted to the women, that it would be pro|per for them to withdraw, if the lady did come down; le&s;t &s;he &s;hould not care to be &s;o free before <HI>them,</HI> on a propo&s;al &s;o particular, as &s;he would be to <HI>us,</HI> who had offer'd it to her con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore brought down word, that the lady was following her. They all three withdrew; and &s;he enter'd at one door, as they went out at the other.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">The Captain acco&s;ted her, repeating the contents of the me&s;&s;age &s;ent up; and de&s;ired, that &s;he would give him her commands in relation to the report he was to make to her uncle Harlowe.</P>
<P>I know not what to &s;ay, Sir, nor what I would have <HI>you</HI> to &s;ay, to my uncle. Perhaps you may have bu&s;ine&s;s in town&mdash;Perhaps you need not &s;ee my uncle, till I have heard from Mi&s;s Howe; till after Lady Betty&mdash;I don't know what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I implored the return of that value, which &s;he had &s;o generou&s;ly acknowleged once to have had for me. I pre&s;umed, I &s;aid, to flatter my&s;elf that Lady Betty, in her own per&s;on, and in the name of all my fa|mily, would be able, on my promi&s;ed reformation and contrition, to prevail in my favour; e&s;pecially as our pro&s;pects in other re&s;pects, with regard to the general reconciliation wi&s;hed for, were &s;o happy. But let me owe to your own genero&s;ity, my deare&s;t creature, &s;aid I, rather than to the mediation of any per&s;on on earth, the forgivene&s;s I am an humble &s;uitor for. How much more agreeable to your&s;elf, O be&s;t beloved of my &s;oul, mu&s;t it be, as well as obliging to me, that your fir&s;t per&s;onal knowlege of my relations, and theirs of you (for they will not be denied attending you), &s;hould not be begun in re|criminations and appeals! As Lady Betty will be here &s;o &s;oon, it will not perhaps be po&s;&s;ible for you to receive her vi&s;it with a brow ab&s;olutely &s;erene. But, deare&s;t, deare&s;t creature, I be&s;eech you, let the mi&s;under&s;tanding pa&s;s as a &s;light one&mdash;As a mi&s;under|&s;tanding clear'd up. Appeals give pride and &s;uperi|ority to the per&s;ons appealed to, and are apt to le&s;&s;en the appellant, not only in their eye, but in her own. Exalt not into judges tho&s;e who are prepared to take le&s;&s;ons and in&s;tructions from you. The individuals of my family are as proud as I am &s;aid to be. But they will chearfully re&s;ign to your &s;uperiority&mdash;You
<PB N="148" REF="149">
will be the fir&s;t woman of the family in every one's eyes.</P>
<P>This might have done with any other woman in the world but <HI>this</HI>; and yet &s;he is the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be &s;aid&mdash; But thus, angrily, did &s;he di&s;claim the compliment.</P>
<P>Yes, indeed!&mdash;(and there &s;he &s;topt a moment, her &s;weet bo&s;om heaving with a noble di&s;dain)&mdash;Trick'd out of my&s;elf, from the very fir&s;t&mdash;A fugitive from my own family! Renounced by my relations! In|&s;ulted by you!&mdash;Laying humble claim to the pro|tection of yours!&mdash;Is not this the light in which I mu&s;t appear not only to the ladies of your family, but to all the world?&mdash;Think you, Sir, that in the&s;e circum&s;tances, or even had I been in the <HI>happie&s;t,</HI> that I could be affected by this plea of unde&s;erved &s;uperiority?&mdash;You are a &s;tranger to the mind of Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, if you think her capable of &s;o poor and &s;o <HI>undue</HI> a pride!</P>
<P>She went from us to the farther end of the room.</P>
<P>The Captain was again affected&mdash;Excellent crea|ture! I called her; and, reverently approaching her, urged further the plea I had la&s;t made.</P>
<P>It is but lately, &s;aid I, that the opinions of my relations have been more than indifferent to me, whether good or bad; and it is for <HI>your</HI> &s;ake, more than for <HI>my own,</HI> that I now wi&s;h to &s;tand well with my whole family. The principal motive of Lady Betty's coming up, is, to purcha&s;e pre&s;ents for the whole family to make on the happy occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, turning to the Captain, with &s;o noble-minded a dear creature, I know, can have no weight; only as it will &s;hew their value and re|&s;pect. But what a damp would their worthy hearts receive, were they to find their admired new niece, as they now think her, not only <HI>not</HI> their niece, but capable of renouncing me for ever! They love me.
<PB N="149" REF="150">
They <HI>all</HI> love me. I have been guilty of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and levity to them, indeed; but of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and le|vity only; and <HI>that</HI> owing to a pride that has &s;et me above meanne&s;s, tho' it has not done every thing for me.</P>
<P>My whole family will be guaranties for my good behaviour to this dear creature, their niece, their daughter, their cou&s;in, their friend, their cho&s;en companion and directre&s;s, all in one.&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, Captain, we <HI>may,</HI> we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be happy.</P>
<P>But, deare&s;t, deare&s;t creature, let me on my knees (and down I dropt, her face all the time turn'd half from me, as &s;he &s;tood at the window, her handker|chief often at her eyes) plead your <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> forgive|ne&s;s; and let us not appear to them, on their vi&s;it, thus unhappy with each other. Lady Betty, the next hour that &s;he &s;ees you, will write her opinion of you, and of the likelihood of our future happine&s;s, to Lady Sarah, her &s;i&s;ter, a weak-&s;pirited woman, who now hopes to &s;upply to her&s;elf, in my bride, the lo&s;t daughter &s;he &s;till mourns for!</P>
<P>The Captain then joined in, re-urging her uncle's hopes and expectations; and his re&s;olution effectually to &s;et about the general reconciliation: The mi&s;chief that might be prevented: The certainty he was in, that her uncle might be prevailed upon to give her to me with his own hand, if &s;he made it her choice to wait for his coming up. But, for his own part, he humbly advi&s;ed, and fervently pre&s;&s;ed her, to make the very next day, or Monday at farthe&s;t, my happy day.</P>
<P>Permit me, deare&s;t Lady, &s;aid he, and I could kneel to you my&s;elf (bending his knee); tho' I have no intere&s;t in my earne&s;tne&s;s, but the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have to be able to &s;erve you all; to be&s;eech you to give me an opportunity to a&s;&s;ure your uncle, that I my&s;elf &s;aw with my own eyes the happy knot ty'd!&mdash;All mi&s;under&s;tandings, all doubts, all diffi|dences, will then be at an end.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">And what, Madam, rejoined I, &s;till kneeling, can there be in your new mea&s;ures, be they what they will, that can &s;o happily, &s;o reputably, I will pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, for all round, obviate the pre&s;ent diffi|culties?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe her&s;elf, if &s;he loves you, and loves your fame, Madam, urged the Captain, his knee &s;till bent, mu&s;t congratulate you on &s;uch a happy con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then turning her face, &s;he &s;aw the Captain half-kneeling&mdash;O Sir! O Capt.

<P>Not mean to &s;uch an angel!&mdash;Nor can I ri&s;e, but to be forgiven!&mdash;</P>
<P>The Captain then re-urged once more the day&mdash; He was amazed, he &s;aid, if &s;he ever valued me&mdash;</P>
<P>O Captain Tomlin&s;on, interrupted &s;he, how much are you the friend of this man!&mdash;<HI>If I had never va|lued him, he never would have had it in his power to in&s;ult me</HI>; nor could I have <HI>taken to heart as I do,</HI> the in&s;ult (execrable as it was) &s;o unde&s;ervedly, &s;o ungratefully given&mdash;But let him retire&mdash;For a mo|ment let him retire.</P>
<P>I was more than half afraid to tru&s;t the Captain by him&s;elf with her&mdash;He gave me a &s;ign that I might depend upon him&mdash;And then I took out of my poc|ket his letter to me, and Lady Betty's, and Mi&s;s Montague's, and Lord M.'s (which la&s;t &s;he had not then &s;een), and giving them to him: Procure for me, in the fir&s;t place, Mr. Tomlin&s;on, a re-peru&s;al of the&s;e three letters; and of <HI>This,</HI> from Lord M. And I be&s;eech you, my deare&s;t life, give them due

con&s;ideration: And let me on my return find the happy effects of it.</P>
<P>I then withdrew; with &s;low feet, however, and a mi&s;giving heart.</P>
<P>The Captain in&s;i&s;ted upon this re-peru&s;al previou&s;ly to what &s;he had to &s;ay to him, as he tells me. She comply'd, but with &s;ome difficulty; as if &s;he was <HI>afraid</HI> of being <HI>&s;often'd in my favour!</HI></P>
<P>She lamented her unhappy &s;ituation; de&s;titute of friends, and not knowing whither to go, or what to do.&mdash;She a&s;ked que&s;tions, <HI>&s;ifting</HI> que&s;tions, about her uncle, about her family, and after what he knew of Mr. Hickman's fruitle&s;s application in her favour.</P>
<P>He was well prepared in this particular; for I had &s;hewn him the letters, and extracts of letters, of Mi&s;s Howe, which I had &s;o happily come at <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 126, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>.

<P>He averr'd that they were.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked, If he thought I had hopes of prevailing on her to go back to town?</P>
<P>He was &s;ure I had not.</P>
<P>Was he really of opinion, that Lady Betty would pay her a vi&s;it?</P>
<P>He had no doubt of it.</P>
<P>But, Sir; but, Captain Tomlin&s;on&mdash;Then impa|tiently turning from him, and again to him, I know not what to do&mdash;But were I <HI>your</HI> daughter, Sir&mdash; Were <HI>you</HI> my own father&mdash;Alas, Sir, I have neither father nor mother!</P>

Then pau&s;ing&mdash;In &s;hort, I never, never can forgive <HI>him,</HI> nor he <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;Do you think, Sir, I would have gone &s;o far, as I have gone, if I had intended ever to draw with him in one yoke?&mdash;I left behind me <HI>&s;uch</HI> a letter&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>You know, Madam, he has acknowleged the ju|&s;tice of your re&s;entment&mdash;</P>
<P>O Sir, he can acknowlege, and he can retract, fifty times a day&mdash;But do not think I am trifling with my&s;elf and you, and want to be <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> to forgive him, and to be <HI>his.</HI>&mdash;There is not a creature of my &s;ex, who would have been <HI>more explicit,</HI> and <HI>more frank,</HI> than I would have been, from the moment I <HI>intended</HI> to be his, had I had a heart like <HI>my own</HI> to deal with. I was always <HI>above re&s;erve,</HI> Sir, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, where I had no cau&s;e of doubt. Mr. Lovelace's conduct has made me appear, perhaps,
<PB N="153" REF="154">
<HI>over-nice,</HI> when my heart wanted to be <HI>encouraged</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI>; and when, if it had been &s;o, my whole behaviour would have been governed by it.</P>
<P>She &s;topt, her handkerchief at her eyes. I in|quired after the minute&s;t part of her behaviour, as well as after her words. I love, thou knowe&s;t, to trace human nature, and more particularly female nature, thro' its mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The pitiful fellow was lo&s;t in &s;ilent admiration of her&mdash;And thus the noble creature proceeded.</P>
<P>It is the fate of unequal unions, that tolerable crea|tures, thro' them, frequently incurr cen&s;ure, when, more happily yoked, they might be intitled to prai&s;e. And &s;hall I not &s;hun an union with a man, that might lead into errors a creature who flatters her&s;elf that &s;he is ble&s;t with an inclination to be good; and who wi&s;hes to make every-one happy with whom &s;he has any connexion, even to her very &s;ervants?</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, taking a turn about the room&mdash;the fellow, devil fetch him, a mummy all the time: Then proceeded.</P>
<P>Formerly, indeed, I hoped to be an humble means of reforming him. But, when I have <HI>no &s;uch hope,</HI> is it right (You are a &s;erious man, Sir) to make a venture that &s;hall endanger <HI>my own morals!</HI></P>
<P>Still &s;ilent was the varlet. If my advocate had no|thing to &s;ay for me, what hope of carrying my cau&s;e?</P>
<P>And now, Sir, what is the re&s;ult of all?&mdash;It is this&mdash;That you will endeavour, if you have that in|fluence over him which a man of your &s;en&s;e and ex|perience ought to have, to prevail upon him, and that for <HI>his own</HI> &s;ake, as well as <HI>mine,</HI> to leave me free to pur&s;ue my own de&s;tiny. And of this you may a&s;&s;ure him, that I never will be any other man's.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, Madam!&mdash;I know that Mr. Lovelace would not hear me with patience on &s;uch a topic. And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I have &s;ome &s;pirit, and
<PB N="154" REF="155">
&s;hould not care to take an indignity from him, or from any man living.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed&mdash;Then re&s;uming&mdash;And think you, Sir, that my uncle will refu&s;e to receive a letter from me?&mdash;<HI>How aver&s;e, Jack, to concede a tittle in my favour!</HI></P>
<P>I know, Madam, as matters are circum&s;tanced, that he would not <HI>an&s;wer</HI> it. If you plea&s;e I will carry one down from you.</P>
<P>And will he not pur&s;ue his intentions in <HI>my</HI> favour, nor be him&s;elf reconciled to me, except I am mar|ried?</P>
<P>From what your brother gives out, and affects to believe, on Mr. Lovelace's living with you in the &s;ame&mdash;</P>
<P>No more, Sir&mdash;I am an unhappy creature!</P>
<P>He then re-urged, that it would be in her power in&s;tantly, or on the morrow, to put an end to all her difficulties.</P>
<P>How can that <HI>be,</HI> &s;aid &s;he? The licence <HI>&s;till</HI> to be obtained? The &s;ettlements <HI>&s;till</HI> to be &s;igned? Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer to my la&s;t <HI>unreceived?</HI>&mdash;And &s;hall I, Sir, be in &s;uch a HURRY, as if I thought my <HI>honour in danger if I delay'd?</HI> Yet <HI>marry</HI> the man from whom only it <HI>can</HI> be endanger'd?&mdash;Unhappy, thrice unhappy, Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash;In how many difficul|ties has one ra&s;h &s;tep involved thee?&mdash;And &s;he turn'd from him, and wept.</P>
<P>The varlet, by way of comfort, wept too: Yet her tears, as he might have ob&s;erved, were tears that indicated rather a <HI>yielding</HI> than a <HI>perver&s;e</HI> temper.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of &s;tone, thou knowe&s;t, &s;o &s;oft in the quarry, that it may, in a manner, be cut with a knife; but if the opportunity be not taken, and it is expo&s;ed to the air for any time, it will become as hard as marble, and then with difficulty it yields to the chizel <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The nature of the <HI>Bath</HI> &s;tone, in particular.</NOTE>. So this lady, not taken at the mo|ment,
<PB N="155" REF="156">
after a turn or two cro&s;s the room, gained more re&s;olution; and then &s;he declared, as &s;he had done once before, that &s;he would wait the i&s;&s;ue of Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer to the letter &s;he had &s;ent her from hence, and take her mea&s;ures accordingly; leav|ing it to him, mean time, to make what report he thought fit, to her uncle; the kinde&s;t that <HI>truth</HI> could bear, &s;he doubted not from Captain Tomlin|&s;on: And &s;he &s;hould be glad of a few lines from him, to hear what <HI>that</HI> was.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed him a good journey. She complained of her head; and was about to withdraw: But I &s;tept round to the door next the &s;tairs, as if I had but ju&s;t come in from the garden; which, as I entered, I called a very pretty one; and took her reluctant hand, as &s;he was going out: My deare&s;t life, you are not going?&mdash;What hopes, Captain?&mdash;Have you not &s;ome hopes to give me of pardon and reconciliation?</P>
<P>She &s;aid, She would not be detained. But I would not let her go, till &s;he had promi&s;ed to return, when the Captain had reported to me what her re&s;olution was.</P>
<P>And when he had, I claimed her promi&s;e; and &s;he came down again, and repeated it, as what &s;he was determined upon.</P>
<P>I expo&s;tulated with her upon it, in the mo&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive and earne&s;t manner. She made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to repeat many of the pleas I had before urged. The Captain &s;econded me with equal earne&s;tne&s;s. At la&s;t, each fell down on his knees before her.</P>
<P>She was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I was afraid at one time &s;he would have fainted. Yet neither of us would ri&s;e without &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions. I pleaded my own &s;ake; the Captain, his dear friend her uncle's; and <HI>both,</HI> the prevention of future mi&s;chief; and the peace and hap|pine&s;s of the two families.</P>
<P>She own'd her&s;elf unequal to the conflict. She &s;igh'd, &s;he &s;obb'd, &s;he wept, &s;he wrung her hands.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">I was perfectly eloquent in my vows and prote&s;ta|tions. Her tearful eyes were ca&s;t down upon me; a glow upon each charming cheek; a vi&s;ible angui&s;h in every lovely feature&mdash;At la&s;t, her trembling knees &s;eeming to fail her, &s;he dropt into the next chair; her charming face, as if &s;eeking for a hiding-place (which a mother's bo&s;om would have be&s;t &s;upply'd), &s;inking upon her own &s;houlder.</P>
<P>I forgot at the in&s;tant all my vows of revenge. I threw my&s;elf at her feet as &s;he &s;at; and, &s;natching her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips. I be&s;ought Hea|ven to forgive my pa&s;t offences, and pro&s;per my fu|ture hopes, as I de&s;igned honourably and ju&s;tly by the charmer of my heart, if once more &s;he would re|&s;tore me to her favour. And I thought I felt drops of &s;calding water (Could they be tears?) trickle down upon my cheeks; while my cheeks, glowing like fire, &s;eemed to &s;corch up the unwelcome &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I then aro&s;e, not doubting of an imply'd pardon in this &s;ilent di&s;tre&s;s. I rai&s;ed the Captain.

<P>The Captain ble&s;s'd me with his eyes and hands&mdash; Thank God, whi&s;per'd he. We approached the lady together.</P>
<P>What hinders, deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid he, what now hinders, but that Lady Betty Lawrance, when &s;he comes, may be acquainted with the truth of every|thing? And a&s;&s;i&s;t privately at your nuptials?&mdash;I will

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o, perhaps&mdash;When Mi&s;s Howe knows your concern for having offended, &s;he will never ad|vi&s;e, that, with &s;uch pro&s;pects of general reconcili|ation, the hopes of &s;o many con&s;iderable per&s;ons in both families, &s;hould be fru&s;trated. Some little time, as that excellent lady has fore&s;een and hinted, will nece&s;&s;arily be taken up, in actually procuring the li|cence, and in peru&s;ing and &s;igning the &s;ettlements. In that time Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer may be received; and Lady Betty may arrive; and &s;he, no doubt, will have weight to di&s;&s;ipate the lady's doubts, and to ac|celerate the day. It &s;hall be my part, mean time, to make Mr. Harlowe ea&s;y. All I fear from delay is, from Mr. James Harlowe's quarter; and there|fore all mu&s;t be conducted with prudence and pri|vacy;&mdash;As your uncle, Madam, has propo&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<P>She was &s;ilent: I rejoiced in her &s;ilence: The dear creature, thought I, has actually forgiven me in her heart!&mdash;But why will &s;he not lay me under ob|ligation to her, by the genero&s;ity of an explicit de|claration?&mdash;And yet, as that would not accelerate any-thing, while the licence is not in my hands, &s;he is the le&s;s to be blamed (if I do her ju&s;tice), that &s;he took more time to <HI>de&s;cend.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">I propo&s;ed, as on the morrow night, to go to town; and doubted not to bring the licence up with me on Monday morning. Would &s;he be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he would not depart from Mrs. Moore's?</P>
<P>She &s;hould &s;tay at Mrs. Moore's, till &s;he had an an&s;wer from Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>I told her, that I hop'd I might have her <HI>tacit</HI> con|&s;ent, at lea&s;t, to the obtaining of the licence.</P>
<P>I &s;aw by the turn of her countenance, that I &s;hould not have a&s;ked this que&s;tion. She was &s;o far from <HI>tacitly</HI> con&s;enting, that &s;he declared to the contrary.</P>
<P>As I never intended, I &s;aid, to a&s;k her to enter again into a hou&s;e, with the people of which &s;he was &s;o much offended, would &s;he be plea&s;ed to give or|ders for her cloaths to be brought up hither? Or &s;hould Dorcas attend her for any of her commands on that head?</P>
<P>She de&s;ired not ever more to &s;ee any-body belong|ing to that hou&s;e. She might perhaps get Mrs. Moore or Mrs. Bevis to go thither for her, and take her keys with them.</P>
<P>I doubted not, I &s;aid, that Lady Betty would ar|rive by that time. I hoped &s;he had no objection to my bringing that lady and my cou&s;in Montague up with me?</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid the Captain, the lady can have no objection to this.</P>
<P>She was &s;till &s;ilent. So &s;ilence in this ca&s;e was a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Would &s;he be plea&s;ed to write to Mi&s;s Howe?&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir! Sir! peevi&s;hly interrupting&mdash;No more que|&s;tions: No pre&s;cribing to me.&mdash;You will do as you think fit. So will I, as I plea&s;e. I own no obligation to you. Captain Tomlin&s;on, your &s;ervant. Re|commend me to my uncle Harlowe's favour: And was going.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">I took her reluctant hand, and be&s;ought her only to promi&s;e to meet me early in the morning.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e meet you? Have you more to &s;ay, than has been &s;aid?&mdash;I have had enough of vows and prote&s;tations, Mr. Lovelace. To what purpo&s;e &s;hould I meet you to-morrow morning?</P>
<P>I repeated my reque&s;t, and that in the mo&s;t fer|vent manner, naming &s;ix in the morning.</P>

<P>She then again recommended her&s;elf to her uncle's favour; and withdrew.</P>
<P>And thus, Belford, has &s;he <HI>mended her markets,</HI> as Lord M. would &s;ay, and I wor&s;ted mine. Mi&s;s Howe's next letter is now the hinge, on which the fate of both mu&s;t turn. I &s;hall be ab&s;olutely ruin'd and undone, if I cannot intercept it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sat. Midnight.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>NO re&s;t,</HI> &s;ays a text that I once heard preached upon, <HI>to the wicked</HI>&mdash;And I cannot clo&s;e my eyes; yet wanted only to compound for half an hour in an elbow-chair. So mu&s;t &s;cribble on.</P>
<P>I parted with the Captain, after another &s;trong de|bate with him in relation to what is to be the fate of this lady. As the fellow has an excellent head, and would have made an eminent figure in any &s;tation of life, had not his early days been tainted with a deep crime, and he detected in it; and as he had the right &s;ide of the argument; I had a good deal of dif|ficulty with him; and at la&s;t brought my&s;elf to pro|mi&s;e, that if I could prevail upon her generou&s;ly to forgive me, and to rein&s;tate me in her favour, I would make it my whole endeavour to get off of my
<PB N="160" REF="161">
contrivances, as happily as I could (only that Lady Betty and Charlotte mu&s;t come); and then, &s;ub&s;ti|tuting him for her uncle's proxy, take &s;hame to my&s;elf, and marry.</P>
<P>But if I &s;hould, Jack (with the &s;tronge&s;t anti|pathy to the &s;tate that ever man had), what a figure &s;hall I make in raki&s;h annals? And can I have taken all this pains for nothing? Or for a wife only, that, however excellent (and <HI>any</HI> woman, do I think, I could make good, becau&s;e I could make any woman <HI>fear</HI> as well as <HI>love</HI> me), might have been obtained with|out the plague I have been at, and much more re|putably than with it? And ha&s;t thou not &s;een, that this haughty lady knows not how to forgive with gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s? Indeed has not at all forgiven me? But holds my &s;oul in a <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e,</HI> which has been &s;o grie|vous to her own.</P>
<P>At this &s;ilent moment I think, that if I were to pur&s;ue my former &s;cheme, and re&s;olve to try whe|ther I cannot make a greater fault &s;erve as a &s;ponge to wipe out a le&s;s; and then be forgiven for that; I can ju&s;tify my&s;elf to <HI>my&s;elf</HI>; and that, as the fair Im|placable would &s;ay, is all in all.</P>
<P>It is my intention, in all my reflections, to avoid repeating, at lea&s;t dwelling upon, what I have before written to thee, tho' the &s;tate of the ca&s;e may not have varied; &s;o I would have thee recon&s;ider the <HI>old</HI> rea&s;onings (particularly tho&s;e contained in my an&s;wer to thy la&s;t expo&s;tulatory non&s;en&s;e <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>277.</HI> &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>; and add the <HI>new,</HI> as they fall from my pen; and then I &s;hall think my&s;elf invincible;&mdash;at lea&s;t, as arguing rake to rake.</P>
<P>I take the gaining of this lady to be e&s;&s;ential to my happine&s;s: And is it not natural for <HI>all men</HI> to aim at obtaining whatever they think will make them happy, be the object more or le&s;s con&s;iderable in the eyes of others?</P>
<P>As to the manner of endeavouring to obtain her,
<PB N="161" REF="162">
by fal&s;ification of oaths, vows, and the like&mdash;Do not the poets of two thou&s;and years and upwards tell us, that Jupiter laughs at the perjuries of lovers? And let me add, to what I have heretofore mentioned on that head, a que&s;tion or two.</P>
<P>Do not the mothers, the aunts, the grandmothers, the governe&s;&s;es of the pretty innocents, always, from their very cradles to riper years, preach to them the de|ceitfulne&s;s of men?&mdash;That they are not to regard their oaths, vows, promi&s;es?&mdash;What a parcel of fibbers would all the&s;e reverend matrons be, if there were not now-and-then a pretty credulous rogue taken in for a ju&s;tification of their preachments, and to &s;erve as a beacon lighted up for the benefit of the re&s;t?</P>
<P>Do we not then &s;ee, that an hone&s;t prowling fel|low is a nece&s;&s;ary evil on many accounts? Do we not &s;ee, that it is highly requi&s;ite that a &s;weet girl &s;hould be now-and-then drawn a&s;ide by him?&mdash;And the more eminent the lady, in the graces of per&s;on, mind, and fortune, is not the example likely to be the more efficacious?</P>
<P>If the&s;e <HI>po&s;tulata</HI> be granted me, who, I pray, can equal my charmer in all the&s;e? Who therefore &s;o fit for an example to the re&s;t of the Sex?&mdash;At wor&s;t, I am intirely within my worthy friend Man|deville's rule, <HI>That private vices are public benefits.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Wafer'd on, as an after-written introduction to the paragraphs which follow.</HEAD>
<P>LORD, Jack, what &s;hall I do now!&mdash;How one evil brings on another!&mdash;Dreadful news to tell thee!&mdash;While I was meditating a &s;imple robbery, here have I (in my own defence indeed) been guilty of murder! A bloody murder!&mdash;So I believe it will prove.&mdash;At her la&s;t ga&s;p!&mdash;Poor impertinent oppo&s;er! Eternally re&s;i&s;ting!&mdash;Eternally contradicting! There &s;he lies, weltering in her blood! Her death's wound have I given her!&mdash;But &s;he was a thief, an impo&s;tor, as well as a tormentor. She had &s;tolen my pen.&mdash; While I was &s;ullenly meditating, doubting, as to my future mea&s;ures, &s;he &s;tole it; and thus &s;he wrote with it, in a hand exactly like my own; and would have faced me down, that it was really my own hand-writing.</P>
<P><Q>But let me reflect, before it be too late. On the manifold perfections of this ever-admirable crea|ture, let me reflect. The hand yet is only held up. The blow is not &s;truck. Mi&s;s Howe's next letter may blow thee up. In policy thou &s;houlde&s;t be now at lea&s;t hone&s;t. Thou can&s;t not live without her. Thou woulde&s;t rather marry her than lo&s;e her ab&s;olutely. Thou maye&s;t undoubt|edly prevail upon her, inflexible as &s;he &s;eems to be, for marriage. But if now &s;he find thee a villain, thou maye&s;t never more engage her attention, and &s;he, perhaps, will refu&s;e and abhor thee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yet already have I not gone too far? Like a repentant thief, afraid of his gang, and obliged to go on, in fear of hanging till he comes to be hang'd, I am afraid of the gang of my cur&s;ed con|trivances.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As I hope to live, I am &s;orry, at the pre&s;ent writing, that I have been &s;uch a fooli&s;h plotter, as to put it, as I fear I have done, out of my <HI>own
<PB N="163" REF="164">
power</HI> to be hone&s;t. I hate compul&s;ion in all forms; and cannot bear, even to be <HI>compelled</HI> to be the wretch my choice has made me! &mdash; So now, Belford, as thou ha&s;t &s;aid, I am a machine at la&s;t, and no free agent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon my &s;oul, Jack, it is a very fooli&s;h thing for a man of &s;pirit to have brought him&s;elf to &s;uch a height of iniquity, that he mu&s;t proceed, and cannot help him&s;elf; and yet to be next-to cer|tain, that his very victory will undo him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why was &s;uch a woman as This thrown in my way, who&s;e very fall will be her glory, and, per|haps, not only my &s;hame, but my de&s;truction?</Q></P>
<P><Q>What a happine&s;s mu&s;t that man know, who moves regularly to &s;ome laudable end, and has nothing to reproach him&s;elf with in his progre&s;s to it! When, by hone&s;t means, he attains this end, how great and unmixed mu&s;t be his enjoyments!

<P>A Few words to the information thou &s;ente&s;t me la&s;t night concerning thy poor old man; and then I ri&s;e from my &s;eat, &s;hake my&s;elf, refre&s;h, new-dre&s;s, and &s;o to my charmer, whom, notwith&s;tand|ing her re&s;erves, I hope to prevail upon to walk out with me on the heath, this warm and fine morning.</P>
<P>The birds mu&s;t have awaken'd her before now. They are in full &s;ong. She always gloried in accu|&s;toming her&s;elf to behold the &s;un-ri&s;e; one of God's natural wonders, as once &s;he called it.</P>
<P>Her window &s;alutes the Ea&s;t. The valleys mu&s;t be gilded by his rays, by the time I am with her; for already have they made the up-lands &s;mile, and the face of nature chearful.</P>
<P>How un&s;uitable wilt thou find this gay preface to a &s;ubject &s;o gloomy, as that I am now turning to!</P>
<P>I am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at la&s;t an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Thy &s;ervant tells me, that thou art plaguily grieved at the old fellow's departure.</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay, but thou may&s;t look as if thou wert; hara&s;&s;ed as thou ha&s;t been for a number of days and nights with a clo&s;e attendance upon a dying man, be|holding his drawing-on hour&mdash;Pretending, for de|cency's &s;ake, to whine over his excruciating pangs&mdash; To be in the way to an&s;wer a thou&s;and impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wi&s;hed&s;t to die&mdash; To pray by him&mdash;for &s;o once thou wrote&s;t to me!&mdash;
<PB N="165" REF="166">
To read by him&mdash;To be forced to join in con&s;ulta|tions with a parcel of &s;olemn wou'd-&s;eem-wi&s;e doct|ors, and their officious Zanies the apothecaries, joined with the butcherly tribe of &s;carificators; all combined to carry on the phy&s;ical farce, and to cut out thongs both from his fle&s;h and his e&s;tate&mdash;To have the &s;uper-added apprehen&s;ion of dividing thy intere&s;t in what he &s;hall leave with a crew of eager-hoping, never-to-be-&s;atisfied relations, legatees, and the devil knows who, of private gratificators of pa&s;&s;ions laudable and illauda|ble&mdash;In the&s;e circum&s;tances, I wonder not that thou looke&s;t to &s;ervants (as little grieved at heart as thy|&s;elf, and who are gaping after legacies, as thou after <HI>heir&s;hip</HI>) as if thou indeed wert grieved; and as if the mo&s;t wry-facing woe had befallen thee.</P>
<P>Then, as I have often thought, the reflection that mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e from &s;uch mortifying objects, as the death of one with whom we have been familiar, mu&s;t afford, when we are obliged to attend it in its &s;low approaches, and in its face-twi&s;ting pangs, that it will one day be our own ca&s;e, goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief.</P>
<P>And This it is that, &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon, may temporarily give a fine air of &s;incerity to the wailings of lively widows, heart-exulting heirs, and re&s;iduary legatees of all denominations; &s;ince, by keeping down the inward joy, tho&s;e intere&s;ting reflections mu&s;t &s;adden the a&s;pect, and add an appearance of real concern to the a&s;&s;umed &s;ables.</P>
<P>Well, but, now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings, anxieties, and clo&s;e attendances, tell me what it is; tell me if it compen&s;ate thy trou|ble, and an&s;wer thy hope?</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, thou &s;ee&s;t, by the gravity of my &s;tyle, how the &s;ubject has help'd to mortify me. But the nece&s;&s;ity I am under of committing either &s;peedy matrimony, or a rape, has &s;adden'd over my gayer pro&s;pects, and, more than the ca&s;e it&s;elf, con|tributed

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Morning.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have had the honour of my charmer's company for two complete hours. We met before &s;ix in Mrs. Moore's garden: A walk on the heath refu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>The &s;edatene&s;s of her a&s;pect, and her kind com|pliance in this meeting, gave me hopes. And all that either the Captain or I had urged ye&s;terday to obtain a full and free pardon, that re-urged I; and I told her, be&s;ides, that Capt. Tomlin&s;on was gone down with hopes to prevail upon her uncle Harlowe to come up in per&s;on, in order to pre&s;ent me with the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that man ever received.</P>
<P>But the utmo&s;t I could obtain was, That &s;he would take no re&s;olution in my favour, till &s;he re|ceived Mi&s;s Howe's next letter.</P>
<P>I will not repeat the arguments u&s;ed by me: But I will give thee the &s;ub&s;tance of what &s;he &s;aid in an|&s;wer to them.</P>
<P>She had con&s;idered of every thing, &s;he told me. My whole conduct was before her. The hou&s;e I carried her to, mu&s;t be a vile hou&s;e. The peo|ple early &s;hewed what they were capable of, in the earne&s;t attempt made to fa&s;ten Mi&s;s Partington upon her; as &s;he doubted not, with my approbation.&mdash; [Surely, thought I, &s;he has not received a duplicate of Mi&s;s Howe's letter of detection!] They heard her cries. My in&s;ult was undoubtedly premeditated. By my whole recollected behaviour to her, previous to
<PB N="167" REF="168">
it, it mu&s;t be &s;o. I had the vile&s;t of views, no que|&s;tion. And my treatment of her put it out of all doubt.</P>
<P>Soul all over, Belford! &s;he &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of liber|ties, that my pa&s;&s;ion made me in&s;en&s;ible of having taken.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought me to give over all thoughts of her. Sometimes, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he thought her&s;elf cruelly treated by her neare&s;t and deare&s;t relations: At <HI>&s;uch</HI> times, a &s;pirit of repining, and even of re&s;entment, took place, and the reconciliation, at other times &s;o de|&s;irable, was not then &s;o much the favourite wi&s;h of her heart, as was the &s;cheme &s;he had formerly plan|ned&mdash;of taking her good Norton for her directre&s;s and guide, and living upon her own e&s;tate in the manner her grandfather had intended &s;he &s;hould live.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme, &s;he doubted not, that her cou&s;in Morden, who was one of her tru&s;tees for that e&s;tate, would enable her (and that as &s;he hoped, without litigation) to pur&s;ue. And if he can, and does, what, Sir, let me a&s;k you, &s;aid &s;he, have I &s;een in your conduct, that &s;hould make me prefer to it an union of intere&s;ts, where there is &s;uch a di&s;union in minds?</P>
<P>So thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, there is <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> as well as <HI>re&s;entment,</HI> in the preference &s;he makes again&s;t me!&mdash; Thou &s;ee&s;t, that &s;he pre&s;umes to think, that &s;he can be happy <HI>without</HI> me; and that &s;he mu&s;t be unhappy <HI>with</HI> me!</P>
<P>I had be&s;ought her, in the conclu&s;ion of my re|urged arguments, to write to Mi&s;s Howe before Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer could come, in order to lay before her the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; and if &s;he <HI>would</HI> de|fere to her judgment, to let her have an opportunity to give it, on the full knowlege of the ca&s;e &mdash;</P>
<P>So I would, Mr. Lovelace, was the an&s;wer, if I were in doubt my&s;elf, which I would prefer; mar|riage, or the &s;cheme I have mentioned. You cannot think, Sir, but the latter mu&s;t be my choice. I wi&s;h
<PB N="168" REF="169">
to part with you with temper&mdash;Don't put me upon repeating&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Part with me,</HI> Madam, interrupted I!&mdash;I cannot bear tho&s;e words!&mdash;But let me be&s;eech you, how|ever, to write to Mi&s;s Howe. I hope, if Mi&s;s Howe is not my enemy&mdash;</P>
<P>She is not the enemy of your <HI>per&s;on,</HI> Sir;&mdash;as you would be convinced, if you <HI>&s;aw her la&s;t letter to me</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The lady innocently means, Mr. Lovelace's forged one, p. <HI>94.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>. But were &s;he not an enemy to your <HI>actions,</HI> &s;he would not be <HI>my</HI> friend, nor the friend of <HI>virtue.</HI> Why will you provoke from me, Mr. Lovelace, the har&s;hne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, which, however de&s;erved by you, I am unwilling ju&s;t now to u&s;e; having &s;uf|fered enough in the two pa&s;t days from my own ve|hemence?</P>
<P>I bit my lip for vexation. I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe, proceeded &s;he, knows the full &s;tate of matters already, Sir. The an&s;wer I expect from her re&s;pects <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> not <HI>you.</HI> Her heart is too warm in the cau&s;e of friend&s;hip, to leave me in &s;u&s;pen&s;e one moment longer than is nece&s;&s;ary, as to what I want to know. Nor does her an&s;wer depend ab&s;o|lutely upon her&s;elf. She mu&s;t &s;ee a per&s;on fir&s;t; and that per&s;on perhaps mu&s;t &s;ee others.</P>
<P>The cur&s;ed &s;muggler-woman, Jack!&mdash;Mi&s;s Howe's Town&s;end, I doubt not!&mdash;Plot, contrivance, in|trigue, &s;tratagem!&mdash;Underground moles the&s;e ladies- But let the earth cover me! let me be a mole too, thought I, if they carry their point!&mdash;And if this lady e&s;cape me now.</P>
<P>She frankly owned, that &s;he had once thought of embarking <HI>out of all our ways</HI> for &s;ome one of our American colonies. But now that &s;he had been <HI>com|pelled</HI> to &s;ee me (which had been her greate&s;t dread, and which &s;he would have given her life to avoid), &s;he thought &s;he might be happie&s;t in the re&s;umption
<PB N="169" REF="170">
of her former favourite &s;cheme, if Mi&s;s Howe could find her a reputable and private a&s;ylum, till her cou|&s;in Morden could come. But if he came not &s;oon, and if &s;he had a difficulty to get to a place of refuge, whether from her brother or from <HI>any-body el&s;e</HI> (meaning me, I &s;uppo&s;e), &s;he might yet perhaps go abroad: For, to &s;ay the truth, &s;he could not think of returning to her father's hou&s;e; &s;ince her brother's rage, her &s;i&s;ter's upbraidings, her father's anger, her mother's &s;till more-affecting &s;orrowings, and her own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s under them all, would be in&s;upportable to her.</P>
<P>O Jack! I am &s;ick to death, I pine, I die, for Mi&s;s Howe's next letter! I would bind, gag, &s;trip, rob, and do any thing but murder, to intercept it.</P>
<P>But, determined as &s;he &s;eems to be, it was evident to me, neverthele&s;s, that &s;he had &s;till &s;ome tender|ne&s;s for me.</P>
<P>She often wept as &s;he talk'd, and much oftener &s;igh'd. She looked at me twice with an eye of <HI>un|doubted</HI> gentlene&s;s, and three times with an eye <HI>tend|ing</HI> to compa&s;&s;ion and &s;oftne&s;s: But its benign rays were as often <HI>&s;natch'd</HI> back, as I may &s;ay, and her face averted, as if her &s;weet eye were not to be tru&s;ted, and could not &s;tand again&s;t my eager eyes; &s;eeking, as they did, for a lo&s;t heart in hers, and en|deavouring to penetrate to her very &s;oul.</P>
<P>More than once I took her hand. She &s;truggled not <HI>much</HI> again&s;t the freedom. I pre&s;&s;ed it once with my lips. She was not <HI>very</HI> angry. A frown indeed; but a frown that had more di&s;tre&s;s in it than indigna|tion.</P>
<P>How came the dear &s;oul (cloathed as it is with &s;uch a &s;ilken ve&s;ture) by all its &s;teadine&s;s <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>i.</HI> p. <HI>50, 51, 86, 126, 127.</HI> for what &s;he her&s;elf &s;ays on that &s;teadine&s;s which Mr. Lovelace, tho' a <HI>de|&s;erved</HI> &s;ufferer by it, cannot help admiring.</NOTE>?&mdash;Was it nece&s;&s;ary, that the active gloom of &s;uch a tyrant of a <HI>father,</HI> &s;hould commix with &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ive &s;weet|ne&s;s
<PB N="170" REF="171">
of a will-le&s;s <HI>mother,</HI> to produce a con&s;tancy, an equanimity, a &s;teadine&s;s, in the <HI>daughter,</HI> which never woman before could boa&s;t of?&mdash;If &s;o, &s;he is more obliged to that de&s;potic father than I could have imagined a creature to be, who gave di&s;tinction to every one related to her, beyond what the crown it&s;elf can confer.</P>
<P>I hoped, I &s;aid, that &s;he would admit of the in|tended vi&s;it of the two ladies, which I had &s;o often mentioned.</P>
<P>She was <HI>here.</HI> She <HI>had</HI> &s;een me. She could not help her&s;elf at pre&s;ent. She ever had the highe&s;t re|gard for the ladies of my family, becau&s;e of their worthy characters. There &s;he turned away her &s;weet face, and vanqui&s;hed a half-ri&s;en &s;igh.</P>
<P>I kneeled to her then. It was upon a verdant cu|&s;hion; for we were upon the gra&s;s-walk. I caught her hand. I be&s;ought her with an earne&s;tne&s;s that called up, as I could feel, my heart to my eyes, to make me, by her forgivene&s;s and example, more worthy of them, and of her own kind and generous wi&s;hes. By my &s;oul, Madam, &s;aid I, you &s;tab me with your goodne&s;s, your unde&s;erved goodne&s;s! and I cannot bear it!</P>
<P>Why, why, thought I, as I did &s;everal times in this conver&s;ation, will &s;he not <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> forgive me? Why will &s;he make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to bring my aunt and my cou&s;in to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Can the fort|re&s;s expect the &s;ame advantageous capitulation, which yields not to the &s;ummons of a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s conqueror, as if it gave not the trouble of bringing up, and rai&s;|ing its heavy artillery again&s;t it?</P>
<P>What <HI>&s;en&s;ibilities,</HI> &s;aid the divine creature, with|drawing her hand, mu&s;t thou have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed!&mdash; What a dreadful, what a judicial hardne&s;s of heart mu&s;t thine be; who can&s;t be capable of &s;uch emo|tions as &s;ometimes thou ha&s;t &s;hewn; and of &s;uch &s;entiments, as &s;ometimes have flowed from thy lips;
<PB N="171" REF="172">
yet can&s;t have &s;o far overcome them all, as to be able to act as thou ha&s;t acted, and that, from &s;ettled pur|po&s;e and premeditation; and this, as it is <HI>&s;aid,</HI> through|out the whole of thy life, from infancy to this time!</P>
<P>I told her, that I had hoped, from the generous concern &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed for me, when I was &s;o &s;ud|denly and dangerou&s;ly taken ill&mdash;[The Ipecacuanha experiment, Jack!].</P>
<P>She interrupted me.&mdash;Well have you rewarded me for the concern you &s;peak of! &mdash; However, I will frankly own, now that I am determined to think no more of you, that you might (un&s;atisfied as I never|thele&s;s was with you) have made an intere&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. I be&s;ought her to proceed.</P>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, and turned away her &s;weet face as we walked; do you &s;uppo&s;e, that I had not thought of laying down a plan to govern my&s;elf by, when I found my&s;elf &s;o unhappily over-reached, and cheated, as I may &s;ay, out of my&s;elf?&mdash;When I found, that I could not <HI>be,</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> what I wi&s;hed <HI>to be,</HI> and <HI>to do,</HI> do you imagine, that I had not ca&s;t about, what was the next proper cour&s;e to take?&mdash; And do you believe, that this next cour&s;e has not co&s;t me &s;ome pain, to be obliged to&mdash;</P>
<P>There again &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>But let us break off di&s;cour&s;e, re&s;umed &s;he. The &s;ubject grows too&mdash;She &s;igh'd&mdash;Let us break off di&s;|cour&s;e&mdash;I will go in&mdash;I will prepare for church&mdash; [The devil! thought I.] Well as I <HI>can</HI> appear in the&s;e every-day worn cloaths&mdash;looking upon her&s;elf&mdash; I will go to church.</P>
<P>She then turned from me to go into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, my beloved creature, ble&s;s me with the continuance of this affecting conver&s;ation&mdash;Remor&s;e has &s;eized my heart!&mdash;I have been exce&s;&s;ively wrong&mdash; Give me further cau&s;e to cur&s;e my heedle&s;s folly, by the continuance of this calm, but &s;oul-penetrating conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">No, no, Mr. Lovelace. I have &s;aid too much. Impatience begins to break in upon me. If you can excu&s;e me to the ladies, it will be better for my mind's &s;ake, and for your credit's &s;ake, that I do not &s;ee them. Call me to <HI>them</HI> over-nice, petulant, prudi&s;h; what you plea&s;e, call me to them. Nobody but Mi&s;s Howe, to whom, next to the Almighty, and my own mother, I wi&s;h to &s;tand acquitted of wilful error, &s;hall know the whole of what has pa&s;&s;ed. Be happy, as you may!&mdash;<HI>De&s;erve</HI> to be happy, and happy you will be, in your own reflection at lea&s;t, were you to be ever &s;o unhappy in other re&s;pects.

<P>The noble creature proceeded; for I could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>This &s;elf-acquittal, when &s;pirits are lent me to di&s;pel the darkne&s;s which at pre&s;ent too often over|clouds my mind, will, I hope, make me &s;uperior to all the calamities that can befall me.</P>
<P>Her whole per&s;on was informed by her &s;entiments. She &s;eemed to be taller than before. How the God within her exalted her, not only above me, but above her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Divine creature! (as I <HI>thought</HI> her) I <HI>called</HI> her. I acknowleged the &s;uperiority of her mind; and was proceeding&mdash;But &s;he interrupted me&mdash;All human ex|cellence, &s;aid &s;he, is comparative only. My mind, I believe, is indeed &s;uperior to yours, deba&s;ed as yours is by evil habits. But I had not known it to be &s;o, if you had not <HI>taken pains</HI> to convince me of the inferiority of yours.</P>
<P>How great, how &s;ublimely great, this creature!&mdash; By my &s;oul, I cannot forgive her for her virtues!&mdash; There is no bearing the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the infinite
<PB N="173" REF="174">
inferiority &s;he charged me with.&mdash;But why will &s;he break from me, when good re&s;olutions are taking place?&mdash;The red-hot iron &s;he refu&s;es to &s;trike&mdash;O why will &s;he &s;uffer the yielding wax to harden?</P>
<P>We had gone but a few paces towards the hou&s;e, when we were met by the impertinent women, with notice, that breakfa&s;t was ready. I could only, with up-lifted hands, be&s;eech her to give me hope of a renewed conver&s;ation after breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>No; &s;he would go to church.</P>
<P>And into the hou&s;e &s;he went, and up-&s;tairs direct|ly. Nor would &s;he oblige me with her company at the tea-table.</P>
<P>I offered by Mrs. Moore to quit both the table and the parlour, rather than &s;he &s;hould exclude her&s;elf, or deprive the two widows of the favour of her com|pany.</P>
<P>That was not all the matter, &s;he told Mrs. Moore. She had been &s;truggling to keep down her temper. It had co&s;t her &s;ome pains to do it. She was de&s;i|rous to compo&s;e her&s;elf, in hopes to receive benefit by the divine wor&s;hip &s;he was going to join in.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore hoped for her pre&s;ence at dinner.</P>
<P>She had rather be excu&s;ed. Yet, if &s;he could ob|tain the frame of mind &s;he hoped for, &s;he might not be aver&s;e to &s;hew, that &s;he had got above tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ibilities, which gave con&s;ideration to a man who de|&s;erved not to be to her what he had been.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, no doubt, to let Mrs. Moore know, that the garden-conver&s;ation had not been a recon|ciling one.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore &s;eemed to wonder, that we were not upon a better foot of under&s;tanding, after &s;o long a conference; and the more, as &s;he believed, that the lady had given in to the propo&s;al for the repetition of the ceremony, which I had told them was in&s;i&s;ted upon by her uncle Harlowe. But I accounted for this, by telling both widows, that &s;he was re&s;olved to

<P>THUS it was&mdash;My charmer accompanied Mrs. Moore again to church this afternoon. I had been very earne&s;t, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, to obtain her company at dinner: But in vain. According to what &s;he had &s;aid to Mrs. Moore <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 173.</NOTE>, I was <HI>too con|&s;iderable</HI> to her to be allowed that favour.

<P>My worthy friend Mrs. Bevis thought one &s;ermon a day, <HI>well</HI>-ob&s;erved, enough; &s;o &s;tay'd at home to bear me company.</P>
<P>The Lady and Mrs. Moore had not been gone a

quarter of an hour, when a young country-fellow on hor&s;eback came to the door, and inquired for Mrs. <HI>Harriot Lucas.</HI> The widow and I (undetermined how we were to entertain each other) were in the parlour next the door; and hearing the fellow's in|quiry, O my dear Mrs. Bevis, &s;aid I, I am undone, undone for ever, if you don't help me out!&mdash;Since here, in all probability, is a me&s;&s;enger from that im|placable Mi&s;s Howe with a letter; which, if de|livered to Mrs. Lovelace, may undo all we have been doing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Margaret, take the young man down, and treat him with what the hou&s;e affords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fellow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Madam. But I &s;taid to eat as I came along, ju&s;t upon the Heath yonder, or el&s;e, to &s;ay the truth, I had been here &s;ooner
<STAGE>[<HI>Thank my &s;tars, thought I, thou did&s;t</HI>].</STAGE>
A piece of powder'd beef was upon the table, at the &s;ign of the Ca&s;tle, where I &s;topt to inquire for this hou&s;e: And &s;o, thoff I only intended to whet my whi&s;tle, I could not help eat|ing. So &s;hall only ta&s;te of your ale; for the beef was woundily corn'd.</P>
</SP>
<P>He withdrew, bowing and &s;craping.</P>
<P>Pox on thee, thought I: Get thee gone for a prating dog!</P>
<P>Margaret, whi&s;per'd I, in a female voice, whip|ping out of the clo&s;et, and holding the parlour-door in my hand, Get him out of the hou&s;e as fa&s;t as you
<PB N="180" REF="181">
can, le&s;t they come from church, and catch him here.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peggy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<P>The fellow went down, and, it &s;eems, drank a large draught of ale; and Margaret finding him very talkative, told him, &s;he begg'd his pardon; but &s;he had a &s;weetheart ju&s;t come from &s;ea, whom &s;he was forced to hide in the pantry; &s;o was &s;ure he would excu&s;e her from &s;taying with him.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, to be &s;ure, the clown &s;aid: <HI>For if he could not make &s;port, he would &s;poil none.</HI> But he whi&s;per'd her, that one 'Squire Lovelace was a <HI>damnation rogue,</HI> if the truth might be told.</P>
<P>For what, &s;aid Margaret? And could have given him, &s;he &s;aid, a good dow&s;e of the chaps.</P>
<P>For ki&s;&s;ing all the women he came near.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the dog wrapp'd him&s;elf round Margery, and gave her a &s;mack, that, &s;he told Mrs. Bevis afterwards, &s;he might have heard into the par|lour.</P>
<P>Such, Jack, is human nature: Thus does it ope|rate in all degrees; and &s;o does the clown, as well as his betters, practi&s;e what he cen&s;ures; and cen|&s;ure what he practi&s;es! Yet this &s;ly dog knew not but the wench had a &s;weetheart lock'd up in the pantry. If the truth were known, &s;ome of the ruddy-faced dairy wenches might perhaps call him a <HI>damna|tion rogue,</HI> as ju&s;tly as their betters of the &s;ame &s;ex, might 'Squire Lovelace.</P>
<P>The fellow told the maid, that, by what he di&s;|cern'd of the young lady's face, it look'd very <HI>ro&s;y</HI> to what he took it to be; and he thought her a good deal fatter, as &s;he lay, and not &s;o tall.</P>
<P>All women are born to intrigue, Jack; and pra|cti&s;e it more or le&s;s, as fathers, guardians, governe&s;&s;es, from dear experience can tell; and in love-affairs are naturally expert, and quicker in their wits by half than men. This ready, tho' raw, wench gave an in&s;tance of this, and improved on the drop&s;ical hint I had
<PB N="181" REF="182">
given her. The lady's &s;eeming plumpne&s;s was owing to a drop&s;ical di&s;order, and to the round po&s;ture &s;he lay in&mdash;Very likely, truly. Her appearing to him to be &s;horter, he might have ob&s;erved was owing to her drawing her feet up, from pain, and becau&s;e the couch was too &s;hort, &s;he &s;uppos'd&mdash;Ad-&s;o, he did not think of that. Her ro&s;y colour was owing to her grief and head-ach&mdash;Ay, that might very well be.&mdash;But he was highly pleas'd he had given the letter into Mrs. Harriot's own hand, as he &s;hould tell Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>He de&s;ir'd once more to &s;ee the lady, at his going away, and would not be denied. The widow there|fore &s;at up, with her handkerchief over her face, lean|ing her head again&s;t the wain&s;cot.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked, If &s;he had any <HI>partiklar</HI> me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>No: She was &s;o ill &s;he could not write, which was a great grief to her.</P>
<P>Should he call next day? for he was going to Lon|don, now he was &s;o near; and &s;hould &s;tay at a cou&s;in's that night, who lived in a &s;treet call'd Fetter-lane.</P>
<P>No: She would write as &s;oon as able, and &s;end by the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Well then, if &s;he had nothing to &s;end by him, may-hap he might &s;tay in town a day or two; for he had never &s;een the Lions in the Tower, nor Bedlam, nor the Tombs; and he would make a holiday or two, as he had leave to do, if &s;he had no bu&s;ine&s;s or me&s;&s;age that required his po&s;ting down next day.</P>
<P>She had not.</P>
<P>She offered him the half-guinea I had given her for him; but he refu&s;ed it, with great profe&s;&s;ions of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and love, as he called it, to Mi&s;s Howe; to &s;erve whom, he would ride to the world's end, or <HI>even</HI> to Jericho.</P>
<P>And &s;o the &s;hocking ra&s;cal went away: And glad at my heart was I when he was gone; for I feared
<PB N="182" REF="183">
nothing &s;o much as that he would have &s;taid till they came from church.</P>
<P>Thus, Jack, got I my <HI>heart's-ea&s;e,</HI> the letter of Mi&s;s Howe; and thro' &s;uch a train of accidents, as makes me &s;ay, that the Lady's &s;tars fight again&s;t her: But yet I mu&s;t attribute a good deal to my own precaution, in having taken right mea&s;ures: For had I not &s;ecured the widow by my &s;tories, and the maid by my &s;ervant, all would have &s;ignified nothing. And &s;o heartily were they &s;ecured, the one by a &s;ingle guinea, the other by half a dozen warm ki&s;&s;es, and the aver&s;ion they both had to &s;uch wicked crea|tures as delighted in making mi&s;chief between man and wife, that they promi&s;ed, that neither Mrs. Moore, Mi&s;s Rawlins, Mrs. Lovelace, nor any|body living, till a week at lea&s;t were pa&s;t, and till I gave leave, &s;hould know any thing of the matter.</P>
<P>The widow rejoiced that I had got the mi&s;chief-maker's letter. I excu&s;ed my&s;elf to her, and in|&s;tantly withdrew with it; and, after I had read it, fell to my &s;hort-hand, to acquaint thee with my good luck: And they not returning &s;o &s;oon as church was done (&s;tepping, as it proved, in to Mi&s;s Rawlins's, and tar|rying there a while, to bring that bu&s;y girl with them to drink tea); I wrote thus far to thee, that thou mighte&s;t, when thou came&s;t to this place, rejoice with me upon the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I forbear to communicate to you &s;ome <HI>new &s;tories</HI> of the <HI>abhorred wretch him&s;elf,</HI> which have come to my ears. One in particular, of &s;o <HI>&s;hocking</HI> a nature!&mdash;Indeed, my dear, the man is a devil.</P>
<P>The whole &s;tory of Mrs. Fretchville, and her hou&s;e, I have no doubt to pronounce, likewi&s;e, an ab&s;olute fiction. &mdash;<HI>Fellow! &mdash; How my &s;oul &s;purns the villain!</HI></P>
<P>Your thought of going abroad, and your rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affect me. But, be com|forted, my dear; I hope you will not be under a nece&s;&s;ity of quitting your native country. Were I &s;ure, that That mu&s;t be the cruel ca&s;e, I would abandon all my own better pro&s;pects, and &s;oon be with you. And I would accompany you whither&s;oever you went, and &s;hare fortunes with you: For it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be happy, if I knew that you were expo&s;ed not only to the perils of the &s;ea, but to the attempts of other vile men; your per&s;onal graces attracting every eye, and expo&s;ing you to tho&s;e hourly dangers, which others, le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by the gifts of nature, might avoid.&mdash;All that I know, that Beauty (&s;o greatly coveted, and &s;o greatly admired) is good for!</P>
<P>O, my dear, were I ever to marry, and to be the mother of a CLARISSA (<HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> mu&s;t be the name, if promi&s;ingly lovely!) how often would my heart ake for the dear creature, as &s;he grew up, when I re|flected, that a prudence and di&s;cretion unexampled in woman, had not, in <HI>you,</HI> been a &s;ufficient pro|tection to that beauty, which had drawn after it as many admirers as beholders!&mdash;How little &s;hould I regret the attacks of that <HI>cruel</HI> di&s;temper, as it is

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t parted with Mrs. Town&s;end <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">For the account of Mrs. Town&s;end, &amp;c. &s;ee Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>103, 104, 105.</HI></NOTE>. I thought you had once &s;een her with me: But, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he never had the honour to be per&s;onally known to you. She has a <HI>manlike &s;pirit.</HI> She knows the world. And her two brothers being in town, &s;he is &s;ure &s;he can engage them, in &s;o good a cau&s;e, and (if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion) <HI>both their &s;hips crews,</HI> in your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Give your con&s;ent, my dear; and the <HI>horrid vil|lain</HI> &s;hall be repaid with <HI>broken bones, at lea&s;t,</HI> for all his vilene&s;s!</P>
<P>The misfortune is, Mrs. Town&s;end cannot be with you till <HI>Thur&s;day next,</HI> or <HI>Wedne&s;day, at &s;oone&s;t.</HI> Are you &s;ure you can be &s;afe where you are, till then? I think you are too near London; and perhaps you had better be <HI>in it.</HI> If you remove, let me know <HI>whither,</HI> the very moment.</P>
<P>How my heart is torn, to think of the nece&s;&s;ity &s;o dear a creature is driven to, of hiding her&s;elf! <HI>De|vili&s;h fellow!</HI> He mu&s;t have been &s;portive and wan|ton in his inventions&mdash;Yet that cruel, that &s;avage &s;portivene&s;s has &s;aved you from the &s;udden violence which he has had recour&s;e to in the violation of others, of names and families not contemptible. For &s;uch the <HI>villain</HI> always gloried to &s;pread his &s;nares.</P>
<P>The <HI>vilene&s;s</HI> of this <HI>&s;pecious mon&s;ter</HI> has done more, than any other con&s;ideration could do, to bring Mr. Hickman into credit with me. Mr. Hickman alone knows, for me, of your flight, and the rea&s;on of it. Had I not given him the rea&s;on, he might have thought <HI>&s;till wor&s;e</HI> of the vile attempt. I communi|cated it to him by &s;hewing him your letter from Ham|&s;tead.
<PB N="186" REF="187">
When he had read it (<HI>and he trembled</HI> and <HI>reddened,</HI> as he read), he threw him&s;elf at my feet, and be&s;ought me to permit him to attend you, and to give you the protection of his hou&s;e. The good-natured man had tears in his eyes, and was repeatedly earne&s;t on this &s;ubject; propo&s;ing to take his chariot-and-four, or a &s;et, and in per&s;on, in the face of all the world, give him&s;elf the glory of protecting &s;uch an oppre&s;&s;ed innocent.</P>
<P>I could not but be plea&s;ed with him. And I let him know that I was. I hardly expected &s;o much &s;pi|rit from him. But a man's pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s to a beloved object of our &s;ex may not, perhaps, argue want of courage on proper occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I thought I ought, in return, to have &s;ome con|&s;ideration for his &s;afety, as &s;uch an open &s;tep would draw upon him the vengeance of the mo&s;t <HI>villainous enterprizer</HI> in the world, who has always a <HI>gang of fellows,</HI> &s;uch as him&s;elf, at his call, ready to &s;upport one another in the vile&s;t outrages. But yet, as Mr. Hickman might have &s;trengthened his hands by legal recour&s;es, I &s;hould not have &s;tood upon it, had I not known your delicacies (&s;ince &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t have made a great noi&s;e, and given occa&s;ion for &s;candal, as if &s;ome advantage had been gained over you), and were there not the greate&s;t probability, that all might be more &s;ilently, and more effectually, managed by Mrs. Town&s;end's means.</P>
<P>Mrs. Town&s;end will in per&s;on attend you&mdash;She <HI>hopes,</HI> on Wedne&s;day.&mdash;Her brothers, and &s;ome of their people, will &s;catteringly, and as if they knew nothing of you (&s;o we have contrived), &s;ee you &s;afe not only to London, but to her hou&s;e at Deptford.</P>
<P>She has a kin&s;woman, who will take your com|mands there, if &s;he her&s;elf be obliged to leave you. And there you may &s;tay, till the wretch's fury on lo&s;ing you, and his &s;earch, are over.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">He will very &s;oon, 'tis likely, enter upon &s;ome <HI>new villainy,</HI> which may engro&s;s him: And it may be given out, that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cou&s;in Morden at Florence.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, if he can be made to believe it, he will go over in hopes to find you there.</P>
<P>After a while, I can procure you a lodging in one of the neighbouring villages; where I may have the happine&s;s to be your daily vi&s;iter. And if this Hickman be not &s;illy, and api&s;h, and if my mother do not do unaccountable things, I may the &s;ooner think of marrying, that I may, without controul, receive and entertain the darling of my heart.</P>
<P>Many, very many, happy days, do I hope we &s;hall yet &s;ee together: And as this is <HI>my</HI> hope, I expect, that it will be <HI>your</HI> con&s;olation.</P>
<P>As to your e&s;tate, &s;ince you are re&s;olved not to litigate for it, we will be patient, either till Col. Morden arrives, or till &s;hame compels &s;ome people to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I cannot but think your pro|&s;pects <HI>now</HI> much happier, than they could have been, had you been actually married to &s;uch a man as this. I mu&s;t therefore congratulate you upon your e&s;cape, not only from a <HI>horrid libertine,</HI> but from <HI>&s;o vile a hu&s;band,</HI> as he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have made to any wo|man; but more e&s;pecially to a per&s;on of your virtue and delicacy.</P>
<P>You hate him, heartily hate him, I hope, my dear&mdash; I am &s;ure you do. It would be &s;trange, if &s;o much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is &s;o repugnant to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In your letter before me, you mention one written to me for a <HI>feint</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 351, 352&mdash;357.</NOTE>. I have not received any &s;uch. Depend upon it therefore, that he mu&s;t have it. And if he has, it is a wonder, that he did not likewi&s;e get my long one of the 7th. Heaven be
<PB N="188" REF="189">
prai&s;ed that he did not; <HI>and that it came &s;afe to your hands!</HI></P>
<P>I &s;end this by a young fellow, who&s;e father is one of our tenants, with command to deliver it to no other hands but yours. He is to return directly, if you give him any letter. If not, he will proceed to London upon his own plea&s;ures. He is a &s;imple fellow; but very hone&s;t. So you may &s;ay any thing to him. If you write not by him, I de&s;ire a line or two, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>My mother knows nothing of his going to you. Nor yet of your abandoning <HI>the fellow!</HI> Forgive me!&mdash;But he's not intitled to good manners.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long to hear how you and Mrs. Town&s;end order matters. I wi&s;h &s;he could have been with you &s;ooner. But I have lo&s;t no time in engaging her, as you will &s;uppo&s;e. I refer to <HI>her,</HI> what I have further to &s;ay and advi&s;e. So &s;hall conclude with my prayers, that Heaven will direct, and protect, my deare&s;t creature, and make your future days happy!</P>

</LETTER>
<P>AND now, Jack, I will &s;uppo&s;e, that thou ha&s;t read this cur&s;ed letter. Allow me to make a few ob&s;ervations upon &s;ome of its contents, which I will do in my crow-quill &s;hort-hand, that they may have the appearance of notes upon the vixen's text.</P>
<Q><P><HI>It is &s;trange to Mi&s;s Howe, that having got her friend at &s;uch a &s;hocking advantage,</HI> &amp;c.] And it is &s;trange to me, too. If ever I have &s;uch another opportunity given me, the cau&s;e of both our wonder, I believe, will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>So thou &s;ee&s;t Tomlin&s;on is further detected. No &s;uch per&s;on as Mrs. Fretchville. <HI>May lightning from heaven</HI>&mdash;O Lord, O Lord, O Lord! &mdash;What a horrid vixen is this! &mdash;My <HI>gang,</HI> my <HI>remor&s;ele&s;s gang,</HI> too, is brought in&mdash;And thou wilt plead for the&s;e girls again; wilt thou?&mdash;<HI>Heaven be prai&s;ed,</HI> &s;he &s;ays, that her friend is out of danger &mdash;Mi&s;s Howe &s;hould be &s;ure of <HI>that:</HI> And that &s;he her&s;elf is &s;afe.&mdash;But for this termagant (as I have often &s;aid), I mu&s;t &s;urely have made a better hand of it&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>New &s;tories</HI> of me, Jack!&mdash;What can they be?&mdash;I have not found, that my genero&s;ity to my Ro&s;ebud ever did me <HI>due</HI> credit with this
<PB N="189" REF="190">
pair of friends. Very hard, Belford, that Credits cannot be &s;et again&s;t Debits, and a balance &s;truck in a Rake's favour, as well as in that of every <HI>common</HI> man!&mdash;But he, from whom no good is expected, is not allowed the merit of the good he does.</P>
<P>I ought to have been a little more attentive to <HI>character,</HI> than I have been. For, notwith&s;tanding that the mea&s;ures of Right and Wrong are &s;aid to be &s;o manife&s;t, let me tell thee, that <HI>character</HI> bya&s;&s;es and runs away with all mankind. Let a man or woman once e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the world's opinion, and all that either of them do will be &s;anctified. Nay, in the very courts of ju&s;tice, does not <HI>character</HI> acquit or condemn as often as facts, and &s;ometimes even in &s;pite of facts?&mdash;Yet, (impolitic that I have been, and am!) to be &s;o carele&s;s of mine!&mdash;And now, I doubt, it is irretrievable.&mdash;But to leave moralizing.</P>
<P>Thou, Jack, knowe&s;t almo&s;t all my enterprizes worth remembring. Can this particular &s;tory, which this girl hints at, be that of Lucy Villars?&mdash;Or can &s;he have heard of my intrigue with the pretty Gyp&s;ey, who met me in Norwood, and of the trap I caught her cruel hu&s;band in (a fellow, as gloomy and tyrannical as old Harlowe), when he pur|&s;ued a wife, who would not have de&s;erved ill of <HI>him,</HI> if he had de|&s;erved well of <HI>her?</HI>&mdash;But he was not quite drowned. The man is alive at this day: And Mi&s;s Howe mentions the &s;tory as a <HI>very</HI> &s;hock|ing one. Be&s;ides, both the&s;e are a twelvemonth old, or more.</P>
<P>But evil fame and &s;candal are always <HI>new.</HI> When the offender has forgot a vile fact, it is often told to one and to another, who, having never heard of it before, trumpet it about, as a novelty to others. But well &s;aid the hone&s;t corregidor at Madrid, a &s;aying with which I inriched Lord M.'s collection &mdash; <HI>Good actions are remembered but for a day: Bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty.</HI>&mdash; Such is the reli&s;h that the world has for &s;candal. In other words, Such is the de&s;ire which every-one has to exculpate him&s;elf by black|ening his neighbour. You and I, Belford, have been very kind to the world, in furni&s;hing it with many opportunities to gratify its devil.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Howe will abandon her own better pro&s;pects, and &s;hare fortunes with her, were &s;he to go abroad.</HI>]&mdash; Charming Romancer!&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;et about this girl, Jack. I have always had hopes of a woman who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions carry her into &s;uch altitudes!&mdash;Had I attacked Mi&s;s Howe fir&s;t, her pa&s;&s;ions (inflamed and guided, as I could have managed them) would have brought her to my lure in a fortnight.</P>
<P>But thinke&s;t thou (and yet I think thou do&s;t), that there is any thing in the&s;e high flights among the &s;ex? Verily, Jack, the&s;e ve|hement friend&s;hips are nothing but chaff and &s;tubble, liable to be blown away by the very wind that rai&s;es them. Apes! mere apes of <HI>us!</HI> they think the word <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> has a pretty &s;ound with it; and it is much talked of; a fa&s;hionable word: And &s;o, truly, a &s;ingle woman, who thinks &s;he has a Soul, and knows, that &s;he wants &s;ome|thing, would be thought to have found a fellow-&s;oul for it in her own Sex. But I repeat, that the word is a <HI>mere</HI> word, the thing a mere name with them; a cork-bottomed &s;huttlecock, which they are fond of &s;triking to and fro, to make one another glow in the fro&s;ty weather of a &s;ingle &s;tate; but which, when a <HI>man</HI> comes in between the pre|tended <HI>in&s;eparables,</HI> is given up, like their Mu&s;ic, and other maidenly amu&s;ements; which, neverthele&s;s, may be nece&s;&s;ary to keep the pretty
<PB N="190" REF="191">
rogues out of more active mi&s;chief. They then, in &s;hort, having caught the <HI>fi&s;h,</HI> lay a&s;ide the <HI>net</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">He alludes here to the &s;tory of a pope, who, (once a poor fi&s;her|man) thro' every preferment he ro&s;e to, even to that of the cardinalate, hung up in view of all his gue&s;ts, his net, as a token of humility. But, when he arrived at the pontificate, he took it down, &s;aying, That there was no need of the net, when he had caught the fi&s;h.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t a mind, perhaps, to make an exception for the&s;e two ladies. With all my heart. My Clari&s;&s;a has, if <HI>woman</HI> has, a &s;oul capable of friend&s;hip. Her flame is bright and &s;teady. But Mi&s;s Howe's, were it not kept up by her mother's oppo&s;ition, is too vehe|ment to endure. How often have I known oppo&s;ition not only cement Friend&s;hip, but create Love? I doubt not but poor Hickman would fare the better with this vixen, if her mother were as heartily again&s;t him, as &s;he is for him.</P>
<P>Thus much indeed, as to the&s;e two ladies, I will grant thee; that the active &s;pirit of the one, and the meek di&s;po&s;ition of the other, may make their friend&s;hip more durable than it would otherwi&s;e be; for this is certain, that in every friend&s;hip, whether male or female, there mu&s;t be a man and a woman &s;pirit (that is to &s;ay, one of them, a <HI>forbearing</HI> one) to make it permanent.</P>
<P>But this I pronounce, as a truth, which all experience confirms; that friend&s;hip between women never holds to the &s;acrifice of capital gra|tifications, or to the endangering of life, limb, or e&s;tate, as it often does in our nobler &s;ex.</P>
<P>Well, but next comes an indictment again&s;t poor <HI>Beauty!</HI>&mdash;What has Beauty done, that <HI>Mi&s;s Howe</HI> &s;hould be offended at it?&mdash;Mi&s;s Howe, Jack, is a charming girl. <HI>She</HI> has no rea&s;on to quarrel with Beauty!&mdash;Did&s;t ever &s;ee her?&mdash;Too much fire and &s;pirit in her eye indeed, for a girl!&mdash;But that's no fault with a man, that can lower that fire and &s;pirit at plea&s;ure; and I know I am the man that can.</P>
<P>A &s;weet auburn Beauty, is Mi&s;s Howe. A fir&s;t Beauty among beauties, when her &s;weeter friend (with &s;uch a commixture of &s;erene gracefulne&s;s, of natural elegance, of native &s;weetne&s;s, yet con&s;cious, tho' not arrogant, dignity, every feature glowing with intelligence) is not in company.</P>
<P>The difference between the two, when together, I have &s;ometimes delighted to <HI>read,</HI> in the addre&s;&s;es of a &s;tranger entering into the pre|&s;ence of both, when &s;tanding &s;ide by &s;ide. There never was an in&s;tance, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, where the &s;tranger paid not his fir&s;t devoirs to my Clari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectful &s;olemn awe &s;at upon every feature of the addre&s;&s;er's face. His eye &s;eemed to a&s;k leave to approach her; and lower than common, whether man or woman, was the bow or courte&s;y. And altho' this awe was immediately dimini&s;hed by her conde&s;cending &s;weet|ne&s;s, yet went it not &s;o intirely off, but that you might &s;ee the reve|rence remain, as if the per&s;on &s;aw more of the godde&s;s, than the woman in her.</P>
<P>But the moment the &s;ame &s;tranger turns to Mi&s;s Howe (tho' proud and &s;aucy, and erect and bridling, &s;he) you will ob&s;erve by the turn of his countenance, and the air of his addre&s;s, a kind of equality
<PB N="191" REF="192">
a&s;&s;umed. He appears to have di&s;covered the woman in her, charming as that woman is. He &s;miles. He &s;eems to expect repartee and &s;martne&s;s, and is never di&s;appointed. But then vi&s;ibly he prepares him&s;elf to <HI>give</HI> as well as <HI>take.</HI> He dares, after he has been a while in her company, to di&s;pute a point with her&mdash; Every point yielded up to the other, tho' no a&s;&s;uming or dogmatical air compels it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, with Miss Howe a bold man &s;ees (No doubt but Sir George Colmar did), that he and &s;he may either very &s;oon be familiar together (I mean with innocence), or he may &s;o far incur her di&s;|plea&s;ure, as to be forbid her pre&s;ence for ever.</P>
<P>For my own part, when I was fir&s;t introduced to this lady, which was by my godde&s;s, when &s;he her&s;elf was a vi&s;iter at Mrs. Howe's; I had not been half an hour with her, but I even hungred and thir&s;ted after a romping-bout with the lively rogue; and in the &s;econd or third vi&s;it, was more deterred by the delicacy of her friend, than by what I apprehended from her own. This charming creature's pre&s;ence, thought I, awes us both. And I wi&s;hed her ab&s;ence, tho' any other lady were pre&s;ent, that I might try the difference in Mi&s;s Howe's behaviour before her friend's face, or behind her back.</P>
<P>Delicate ladies make delicate ladies, as well as decent men. With all Mi&s;s Howe's fire and &s;pirit, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, by her very eye, that &s;he watched for le&s;&s;ons, and feared reproof from the penetrating eye of her milder-di&s;po&s;ition'd friend <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Howe in vol. <HI>iii.</HI> p. <HI>113.</HI> &s;ays, That &s;he was always more afraid of her, than of her mother; and, in p. <HI>215.</HI> That &s;he fears her as much as &s;he loves her; and in many other places, in her letters to Mi&s;s Harlowe, verifies this ob&s;ervation of Mr. Lovelace.</NOTE>: And yet it was as ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, in the candor and &s;weet manners of the other, that the fear which Mi&s;s Howe &s;tood in of her, was more owing to her own gene|rous apprehen&s;ion, that &s;he fell &s;hort of her excellencies, than to Mi&s;s Harlowe's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of excellence over <HI>her.</HI> I have often, &s;ince I came at Mi&s;s Howe's letters, revolved this just and fine prai&s;e con|tained in one of them <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 23.</NOTE>.
<Q>Every one &s;aw, that the preference each gave <HI>you</HI> to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> exalted you not into any vi&s;ible triumph over her; for you had always &s;omething to &s;ay, on every point you carried, that rai&s;ed the yielding heart, and left every one plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied with her&s;elf, tho' &s;he carried not off the palm.</Q></P>
<P>As I propo&s;e in my more advanced life, to endeavour to atone for my youthful freedoms with individuals of the &s;ex, by giving caution and in&s;tructions to the whole, I have made a memorandum to inlarge upon this doctrine;&mdash;to wit, That it is full as nece&s;&s;ary to direct daugh|ters in the choice of their female companions, as it is to guard them again&s;t the de&s;igns of men.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this, however, to the di&s;paragement of Mi&s;s Howe. She has from <HI>pride,</HI> what her friend has from <HI>principle.</HI> [The Lord help the &s;ex, if they had not pride!]&mdash;But yet I am confident, that Mi&s;s Howe is indebted to the conver&s;ation and corre&s;pondence of Mi&s;s Harlowe for her highe&s;t improvements. But, both the&s;e ladies out of the que&s;tion, I make no &s;cruple to averr [And I, Jack, &s;hould know &s;omething of the matter], that there have been more girls ruined, at lea&s;t <HI>prepared</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="193">
for ruin, by their own &s;ex (taking in &s;ervants, as well as companions), than <HI>directly</HI> by the attempts and delu&s;ions of men.</P>
<P>But it is time enough, when I am old and joyle&s;s, to enlarge upon this topic.</P>
<P>As to the compari&s;on between the two ladies, I will expatiate more on that &s;ubject (for I like it) when I have <HI>had them both</HI>&mdash;Which this letter of the vixen girl's, I hope thou wilt allow, warrants me to try for.</P>
<P>I return to the con&s;ideration of a few more of its contents, to ju&s;tify my vengeance, &s;o nearly now in view.</P>
<P>As to Mrs. Town&s;end; her manlike &s;pirit; her two brothers; and their &s;hips crews&mdash;I &s;ay nothing but this to the in&s;olent threatening&mdash; Let 'em come!&mdash;</P>
<P>But as to her &s;ordid menace&mdash;To <HI>repay the horrid villain,</HI> as &s;he calls me, <HI>for all my vilene&s;s,</HI> by BROKEN BONES!&mdash;Broken bones, Belford!&mdash;Who can bear this porterly threatning!&mdash;Broken bones, Jack!&mdash;Damn the little vulgar&mdash;Give me a name for her&mdash;But I bani&s;h all furious re&s;entment. If I get the&s;e two girls into my power, Heaven forbid that I &s;hould be a &s;econd Phalaris, and turn his bull upon the arti&s;t! No bones of theirs will I break!&mdash;They &s;hall come off with me upon much lighter terms!&mdash;</P>
<P>But the&s;e fellows are &s;mugglers, it &s;eems. And am not I a &s;mug|gler too?&mdash;I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that I &s;hall have &s;ecured my goods before Thur&s;day or Wedne&s;day either.</P>
<P>But did I want a plot, what a charming new one does this letter of Mi&s;s Howe &s;trike me out? I am almo&s;t &s;orry, that I have fixed upon one.&mdash;For here, how ea&s;y would it be for me, to a&s;&s;emble a crew of &s;wabbers, and to create a Mrs. Town&s;end (who&s;e per&s;on, thou &s;ee&s;t, my Beloved knows not) to come on Tue&s;day, at Mi&s;s Howe's <HI>renewed</HI> urgency, in order to carry my Beloved to a warehou&s;e of my own providing?</P>
<P>This, however, is my triumphant hope, that at the very time, that the&s;e ragamuffins will be at Ham&s;tead (looking for us), my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe and I (&s;o the fates, I imagine, have ordained) &s;hall be fa&s;t a&s;leep in each other's arms in town.&mdash;Lie &s;till, villain, till the time comes.&mdash;My heart, Jack; my heart!&mdash;It is always thumping away on the remote&s;t pro&s;pects of this nature.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, that <HI>the vilene&s;s of this &s;pecious mon&s;ter</HI> (meaning me Jack!) has brought Hickman into credit with her. So I have done <HI>&s;ome</HI> good!&mdash;But to whom, I cannot tell: For this poor fellow, &s;hould I permit him to have this termagant, will be puni&s;hed, as many times we all are, by the enjoyment of his own wi&s;hes.&mdash;Nor can &s;he be happy, as I take it, with him, were he to govern him&s;elf by her will, and have none of his own; &s;ince never was there a directing wife, who knew where to &s;top: Power makes &s;uch a one wanton&mdash; She de&s;pi&s;es the man &s;he can govern. Like Alexander, who wept, that he had no more worlds to conquer, &s;he will be looking out for new exerci&s;es for her power, till &s;he grow unea&s;y to her&s;elf, a di&s;credit to her hu&s;band, and a plague to all about her.</P>
<P>But this hone&s;t fellow, it &s;eems, with <HI>tears in his eyes,</HI> and with <HI>humble pro&s;tration,</HI> be&s;ought the vixen to <HI>permit</HI> him to &s;et out in his <HI>chariot and four,</HI> in order to <HI>give him&s;elf the glory of protecting &s;uch
<PB N="193" REF="194">
an oppre&s;&s;ed innocent, in the face of the whole world.</HI>&mdash;Nay, he <HI>red|den'd,</HI> it &s;eems; and <HI>trembled</HI> too! as he read the fair complainant's letter&mdash;How <HI>valiant</HI> is all this!&mdash;Women love <HI>brave</HI> men; and no wonder, that his <HI>tears,</HI> his <HI>trembling,</HI> and his <HI>pro&s;tration,</HI> gave him high reputation with the <HI>meek</HI> Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>But do&s;t think, Jack, that I, in the like ca&s;e (and equally affected with the di&s;tre&s;s) &s;hould have acted thus?&mdash;Do&s;t think, that I &s;hould not fir&s;t have re&s;cued the lady, and then, if needful, have a&s;ked excu&s;e for it, the lady in my hand?&mdash;Woulde&s;t not <HI>thou</HI> have done thus, as well as I?</P>
<P>But 'tis be&s;t as it is. Hone&s;t Hickman may now &s;leep in a whole &s;kin. And yet that is more perhaps than he would have done (the lady's deliverance <HI>unattempted</HI>), had I come at this <HI>reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of his any other way, than by a letter, that it mu&s;t not be known I have intercepted.</P>
<P>She thinks I may be diverted from pur&s;uing my charmer, by &s;ome new-&s;tarted <HI>villainy. Villainy</HI> is a word that &s;he is extremely fond of. But I can tell her, that it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould, till the end of this <HI>vil|lainy</HI> be obtained. Difficulty is a <HI>&s;timulus</HI> with &s;uch a &s;pirit as mine. I thought Mi&s;s Howe knew me better. Were &s;he to offer her&s;elf, per&s;on for per&s;on, in the romancing zeal of her friend&s;hip, to &s;ave her friend, it &s;hould not do, while the dear creature is on this &s;ide the moon.</P>
<P>She thanks Heaven, that her friend has received her letter of the 7th. We are all glad of it. She ought to thank me too. But I will not at pre&s;ent claim her thanks.</P>
<P>But when &s;he rejoices, that that letter went &s;afe, does &s;he not, in effect, call out for vengeance, and <HI>expect</HI> it?&mdash;All in good time, Mi&s;s Howe. <HI>When &s;ette&s;t thou out for the I&s;le of Wight, Love?</HI></P>
<P>I will clo&s;e at this time with de&s;iring thee to make a <HI>li&s;t</HI> of the viru|lent terms with which the inclo&s;ed letter abounds: And then, if thou &s;uppo&s;e&s;t, that I have made &s;uch another, and have added to it all the flowers of the &s;ame blow, in the former letters of the &s;ame fancy creature, and tho&s;e in that of Mi&s;s Harlowe, left for me on her elopement, thou wilt certainly think, that I have provocations &s;uffi|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent to ju&s;tify me in all I &s;hall do to either.</P>
<P>Return the inclo&s;ed the moment thou ha&s;t peru&s;ed it.</P></Q>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Night&mdash;Monday Morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WENT down with revenge in my <HI>heart</HI>; the contents of Mi&s;s Howe's letter almo&s;t engro&s;&s;ing me, the moment that Mi&s;s Harlowe and Mrs. Moore, accompanied by Mi&s;s Rawlins, came in: But in my
<PB N="194" REF="195">
countenance all the gentle, the placid, the &s;erene, that the gla&s;s could teach; and in my behaviour all the polite, that &s;uch an unpolite creature, as &s;he has often told me I am, could put on.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins was &s;ent for home, almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he came in, to entertain an unexpected vi&s;iter; to her great regret, as well as to the di&s;appointment of my fair one, as I could perceive from the looks of both: For they had agreed, it &s;eems, if I went to town, as I &s;aid I intended to do, to take a walk upon the heath; at lea&s;t in Mrs. Moore's garden; and who knows, what might have been the i&s;&s;ue, had the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity in the one met with the &s;pirit of communication in the other?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Rawlins promi&s;ed to return, if po&s;&s;ible: But &s;ent to excu&s;e her&s;elf; her vi&s;iter intending to &s;tay with her all night.</P>
<P>I rejoiced in my heart, at her me&s;&s;age; and after much &s;upplication obtained the favour of my Be|loved's company for another walk in the garden, having, as I told her, abundance of things to &s;ay, to propo&s;e, and to be informed of, in order ultimately to govern my&s;elf in my future &s;teps.</P>
<P>She had vouch&s;afed, I &s;hould tell thee, with eyes turned from me, and in an <HI>half-a&s;ide</HI> attitude, to &s;ip two di&s;hes of tea in my company&mdash;Dear &s;oul!&mdash;How anger <HI>unpoli&s;hes</HI> the mo&s;t polite! for I never &s;aw Mi&s;s Harlowe behave &s;o aukwardly. I imagined &s;he knew not how to be aukward.</P>
<P>When we were in the garden, I poured my whole &s;oul into her attentive ear; and be&s;ought her return|ing favour.</P>
<P>She told me, that &s;he had formed her &s;cheme for her future life: That, vile as the treatment was which &s;he had received from me, that was not all the rea&s;on &s;he had for rejecting my &s;uit: But that, on the ma|ture&s;t deliberation, &s;he was convinced, that &s;he could
<PB N="195" REF="196">
neither be happy with me, nor make me happy; and &s;he injoined me, for both our &s;akes, to think no more of her.</P>
<P>The Captain, I told her, was rid down po&s;t in a manner, to forward my wi&s;hes with her uncle.</P>
<P>Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time.</P>
<P>I would &s;et out early in the morning to attend them.</P>
<P>They adored her. They longed to &s;ee her. They <HI>would</HI> &s;ee her.&mdash;They would not be denied her com|pany into Oxford&s;hire.</P>
<P>Where could &s;he better go, to be free from her brother's in&s;ults?&mdash;Where, to be ab&s;olutely made unapprehen&s;ive of any-body el&s;e?&mdash;Might I have any hopes of her returning favour, if Mi&s;s Howe could be prevailed upon to intercede for me?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Howe prevailed upon to intercede for you!</HI> repeated &s;he, with a &s;cornful bridle, but a very pretty one.&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>I <HI>repeated</HI> the concern it would be to me, to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning the mi&s;under&s;tand|ing to Lady Betty and my cou&s;in, as a mi&s;under|&s;tanding &s;till to be made up; and as if I were of very <HI>little</HI> con&s;equence to a dear creature, who was of &s;o <HI>much</HI> to me; urging, that it would extremely lower me, not only in my own opinion, but in that of my relations.</P>
<P>But &s;till &s;he referred to Mi&s;s Howe's next letter; and all the conce&s;&s;ion I could bring her to in this whole conference, was, that &s;he would wait the arrival and vi&s;it of the two ladies, if they came in a day or two, or before &s;he received the expected letter from Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven for this! thought I. And now may I go to town with hopes at my return to find thee, deare&s;t, where I &s;hall leave thee.</P>
<P>But yet I &s;hall not intirely tru&s;t to this, as &s;he may
<PB N="196" REF="197">
find rea&s;ons to change her mind in my ab&s;ence. My fellow, therefore, who is in the hou&s;e, and who, by Mrs. Bevis's kind intelligence, will know every &s;tep &s;he can take, &s;hall have Andrew and a hor&s;e ready, to give me immediate notice of her motions; and more|over, go where &s;he will, he &s;hall be one of her re|tinue, tho' unknown to her&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This was all I could make of the fair Inexorable. Should I be glad of it, or &s;orry for it?&mdash;</P>
<P>Glad, I believe: And yet my pride is confoundedly abated to think, that I had &s;o little hold in the affections of this daughter of the Harlowes.</P>
<P>Don't tell me, that virtue and principle are her guides on this occa&s;ion!&mdash;'Tis <HI>pride,</HI> a greater pride than my own, that governs her. Love, &s;he has none, thou &s;ee&s;t; nor ever had; at lea&s;t not in a &s;uperior degree.&mdash;Love never was under the dominion of <HI>prudence,</HI> or of any <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> power.&mdash;She cannot bear to be thought a <HI>woman,</HI> I warrant!&mdash;And if, in the la&s;t attempt, I find her <HI>not</HI> one, what will &s;he be the wor&s;e for the tryal?&mdash;No one is to blame for &s;uffering an evil he cannot &s;hun or avoid.</P>
<P>Were a general to be overpower'd, and robb'd by a highwayman, would he be le&s;s fit for the command of an army on that account?&mdash;If indeed the general, pretending great valour, and having boa&s;ted, that he never would be robb'd, were to make but faint re|&s;i&s;tance, when he was brought to the te&s;t, and to yield his pur&s;e when he was ma&s;ter of his own &s;word, then indeed will the highwayman, who robs him, be thought the braver man.</P>
<P>But from the&s;e la&s;t conferences am I furni&s;hed with an argument in defence of my favourite purpo&s;e, which I never yet pleaded.</P>
<P>O Jack! what a difficulty mu&s;t a man be allowed to have, to conquer a predominant pa&s;&s;ion, be it what it will, when the gratifying of it is in his <HI>power,</HI> however wrong he knows it to be to re&s;olve to gra|tify
<PB N="197" REF="198">
it! Reflect upon this; and then wilt thou be able to account for, if not to excu&s;e, a projected crime, which has <HI>habit</HI> to plead for it, in a brea&s;t as &s;tormy, as uncontroulable!&mdash;</P>
<P>This my new argument&mdash;</P>
<P>Should &s;he fail in the trial; &s;hould I &s;ucceed; and &s;hould &s;he refu&s;e to go on with me; and even to marry me; which I can have no notion of&mdash;And &s;hould &s;he di&s;dain to be obliged to me for the hand|&s;ome provi&s;ion I &s;hould be proud to make for her, even to the <HI>half of my e&s;tate</HI>; yet cannot &s;he be altogether unhappy&mdash;Is &s;he not intitled to an inde|pendent fortune? Will not Col. Morden, as her tru&s;tee, put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? And did &s;he not, in our former conference, point out the <HI>way of life,</HI> that &s;he always preferred to the <HI>married life?</HI>&mdash;
<Q>To take her good Norton for her directre&s;s and guide, and to live upon her own e&s;tate in the manner her grandfather de&s;ired &s;he &s;hould live <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>167.</HI></NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>It is moreover to be con&s;idered, that &s;he cannot, according to her own notions, recover above <HI>one half</HI> of her fame, were we now to intermarry; &s;o much does &s;he think &s;he has &s;uffered by her going off with me. And will &s;he not be always repining and mourn|ing for the lo&s;s of the <HI>other half?</HI>&mdash;And if &s;he mu&s;t live a life of &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s and regret for <HI>half,</HI> may &s;he not as well repine and mourn for the <HI>whole?</HI></P>
<P>Nor, let me tell thee, will her own &s;cheme of penitence, in this ca&s;e, be half &s;o perfect, if &s;he do <HI>not</HI> fall, as if &s;he <HI>does:</HI> For what a fooli&s;h penitent will &s;he make, who has nothing to repent of?&mdash; She piques her&s;elf, thou knowe&s;t, and makes it mat|ter of reproach to me, that &s;he went not off with me by her own con&s;ent; but was tricked out of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows &s;o repeatedly made. She will not, thou &s;ee&s;t,
<PB N="198" REF="199">
<HI>permit</HI> me to fulfil them. And if &s;he <HI>would,</HI> this I have to &s;ay, that at the time I made the mo&s;t &s;olemn of them, I was fully determined to keep them. But what prince thinks him&s;elf obliged any longer to ob&s;erve the articles of the mo&s;t &s;acredly &s;worn-to treaties, than &s;uits with his intere&s;t or inclination; altho' the con&s;equence of the infraction mu&s;t be, as he knows, the de&s;truction of thou&s;ands?</P>
<P>Is not this then the re&s;ult of all, that Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, if it be not her own fault, may be as virtuous <HI>after</HI> &s;he has lo&s;t her honour, as it is called, as &s;he was <HI>before?</HI> She may be a more eminent ex|ample to her &s;ex; and if &s;he yield (a <HI>little</HI> yield) in the tryal, may be a <HI>completer penitent.</HI> Nor can &s;he, but by her own wilfulne&s;s, be reduced to <HI>low for|tunes.</HI></P>
<P>And thus may her <HI>old</HI> nur&s;e and &s;he; an <HI>old</HI> coachman; and a pair of <HI>old</HI> coach-hor&s;es; and two or three <HI>old</HI> maid-&s;ervants, and perhaps a <HI>very old</HI> footman or two (for every thing will be old and penitential about her), live very comfortably toge|ther; reading <HI>old</HI> &s;ermons, and <HI>old</HI> prayer-books; and relieving <HI>old</HI> men, and <HI>old</HI> women; and giving <HI>old</HI> le&s;&s;ons, and <HI>old</HI> warnings, upon new &s;ubjects, as well as <HI>old</HI> ones, to the young ladies of her neigh|bourhood; and &s;o pa&s;s on to a good <HI>old</HI> age, doing a great deal of good, both by precept and example, in her generation.</P>
<P>And is a lady, who can live thus prettily, without <HI>controul</HI>; who ever did prefer, and who <HI>&s;till</HI> prefers, the <HI>Single</HI> to the <HI>Married life</HI>; and who will be en|abled to do every thing, that the plan &s;he had formed will direct her to do; be &s;aid to be ruined, undone, and &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff?&mdash;I have no patience with the pretty fools, who u&s;e tho&s;e &s;trong words, to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t tran&s;itory evil; and which a mere church-form makes none?</P>
<P>At this rate of romancing, how many <HI>flouri&s;hing
<PB N="199" REF="200">
ruins</HI> do&s;t thou, as well as I, know? Let us but look about us, and we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>cen&s;orious</HI> &s;pirits among our acquaintance of that &s;ex, now pa&s;&s;ing for cha&s;te wives, of whom &s;trange &s;tories might be told; and others, who&s;e hu&s;band's hearts have been made to ake for their gaieties, both before and after marriage; and yet know not half &s;o much of them, as &s;ome of us hone&s;t fellows could tell them.</P>
<P>But, having thus &s;atisfied my&s;elf in relation to the wor&s;t that can happen to this <HI>charming creature</HI>; and that it will be her own fault, if &s;he be unhappy; I have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be <HI>my own lot.</HI></P>
<P>This has always been my notion, tho' Mi&s;s Howe grudges us the be&s;t of the &s;ex, and &s;ays, that the wor&s;t is too good for us <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 342.</NOTE>; That the wife of a libertine ought to be pure, &s;potle&s;s, uncontaminated. To what purpo&s;e has &s;uch a one lived a free life, but to know the world, and to make his advantages of it?&mdash;And, to be <HI>very</HI> &s;erious, it would be a misfortune to the public, for two per&s;ons, heads of a family, to be both bad; &s;ince, between two &s;uch, a race of varlets might be propagated, Lovelaces and Belfords, if thou wilt, who might do great mi&s;|chief in the world.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t at bottom, that I am not an aban|doned fellow; and that there is a mixture of gravity in me. This, as I grow older, may increa&s;e; and when my active capacity begins to abate, I may &s;it down with the Preacher, and re&s;olve all my pa&s;t life into vanity and vexation of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This is certain, that I &s;hall never find a woman &s;o well &s;uited to my ta&s;te, as Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe. I only wi&s;h (if I live to &s;ee that day), that I may have &s;uch a lady as her to comfort and adorn my &s;etting-&s;un. I have often thought it very unhappy for us both, that &s;o excellent a creature &s;prung up a little
<PB N="200" REF="201">
too late for my <HI>&s;etting-out,</HI> and a little too early in my <HI>progre&s;s,</HI> before I can think of <HI>returning.</HI> And yet, as I have pick'd up the &s;weet traveller in my way, I cannot help wi&s;hing, that &s;he would bear me com|pany in the <HI>re&s;t</HI> of my journey, altho' &s;he were to &s;tep out of her own path to oblige me. And then, per|haps, we could put up in the <HI>evening</HI> at the &s;ame <HI>inn</HI>; and be very happy in each other's conver&s;ation; re|counting the difficulties and dangers we had pa&s;&s;ed in our way to it.</P>
<P>I imagine, that thou wilt be apt to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in this letter were written in town. Why, Jack, I cannot but &s;ay, that the We&s;tmin&s;ter air is a little gro&s;&s;er than that at Ham&s;tead; and the conver&s;ation of Mrs. Sinclair, and the Nymphs, le&s;s innocent than Mrs. Moore's and Mi&s;s Rawlins's. And I think in my heart, that I can &s;ay and write tho&s;e things at one place, which I cannot at the other; nor indeed any-where el&s;e.</P>
<P>I came to town about &s;even this morning.&mdash;All nece&s;&s;ary directions and precautions remember'd to be given.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought the favour of an audience before I &s;et out. I was de&s;irous to &s;ee which of her lovely faces &s;he was plea&s;ed to put on, after another night had pa&s;&s;ed. But &s;he was re&s;olved, I found, to leave our quarrel open. She would not give me an opportunity &s;o much as to intreat her again to clo&s;e it, before the arrival of Lady Betty and my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>I had notice from my proctor, by a few lines brought by man and hor&s;e, ju&s;t before I &s;et out, that all difficulties had been for two days pa&s;t &s;urmounted; and that I might have the licence for fetching.</P>
<P>I &s;ent up the letter to my Beloved, by Mrs. Bevis. It procured me not admittance, tho' my reque&s;t for <HI>that,</HI> was &s;ent with it.</P>
<P>And now, Belford, I &s;et out upon bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>A good whim&s;ical in&s;trument, take it all together! &mdash;But what, thinke&s;t thou, are the arms to this matrimonial harbinger?&mdash;Why, in the fir&s;t place, <HI>Two cro&s;&s;ed &s;words</HI>; to &s;hew, that marriage is a &s;tate of offence as well as defence: <HI>Three lions</HI>; to de|note, that tho&s;e who enter into the &s;tate, ought to have a triple proportion of courage.

<P><PB N="203" REF="204">To de&s;cribe it according to heraldry-art, if I am not mi&s;taken&mdash;Gules, two &s;words, &s;altire-wi&s;e, Or; &s;econd coat, a chevron &s;able between three bugle|horns, Or [<HI>So it ought to be</HI>]: On a chief of the &s;e|cond, three lions rampant of the fir&s;t&mdash;But the devil take them for their hieroglyphics, &s;hould I &s;ay, if I were determined in good earne&s;t to marry!</P>
<P>And determined to marry I would be, were it not for this con&s;ideration; That once married, and I am married for life.</P>
<P>That's the plague of it! &mdash; Could a man do as the birds do, change every Valentine's day [A <HI>natural</HI> ap|pointment! for birds have not the <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> for&s;ooth, to fetter them&s;elves, as we wi&s;eacre men take great and &s;olemn pains to do]; there would be nothing at all in it. And what a glorious time would the <HI>Lawyers</HI> have, on the one hand, with their <HI>Noverint univer&s;i's,</HI> and &s;uits commenceable on re&s;titution of goods and chattels; and the <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> on the other, with their indulgencies (renewable annually, as <HI>other</HI> licences) to the <HI>hone&s;t de&s;ires</HI> of their clients?</P>
<P>Then, were a &s;tated mulct, according to rank or fortune, to be paid on every change, towards the exigencies of the State [But none on <HI>renewals</HI> with the <HI>old loves,</HI> for the &s;ake of encouraging con&s;tancy, e&s;pecially among the <HI>minores</HI>], the change would be made &s;ufficiently difficult, and the whole Public would be the better for it; while tho&s;e children, which the parents could not agree about maintaining, might be con&s;idered as the <HI>children of the Public,</HI> and provided for like the children of the antient Spartans; who were (as ours would in this ca&s;e be) a nation of heroes. How, Jack, could I have improved upon Lycurgus's in&s;titutions, had I been a lawgiver <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>Did I never &s;hew thee a &s;cheme, which I drew up on &s;uch a no|tion as this?&mdash;In which I demon&s;trated the <HI>conveniencies,</HI> and obviated the <HI>inconveniences,</HI> of changing the pre&s;ent mode to this? I believe I never did.</P>
<P>I remember I proved, to a demon&s;tration, that &s;uch a change would be a means of annihilating, ab&s;olutely annihilating, four or five very atrocious and capital &s;ins.&mdash;<HI>Rapes,</HI> vulgarly &s;o called; Adultery, and Fornication; nor would <HI>Polygamy</HI> be panted after. Frequently would it prevent <HI>Murders</HI> and <HI>Duelling:</HI> Hardly any &s;uch thing as <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> (the cau&s;e of &s;hocking violences) would be heard of: And Hypocri&s;y be|tween man and wife be bani&s;hed the bo&s;oms of each. Nor, probably, would the reproach of <HI>barrenne&s;s</HI> re&s;t, as now it too often does, where it is lea&s;t de&s;erved.&mdash;Nor would there, po&s;&s;ibly, be &s;uch a per&s;on as a barren woman.</P>
<P>Moreover, what a multitude of dome&s;tic quarrels would be avoided, were &s;uch a &s;cheme carried into execution? Since both &s;exes would bear with each other, in the view that they could help them&s;elves in a few months.</P>
<P>And then what a charming &s;ubject for conver&s;ation would be the gal|lant and generous la&s;t partings between man and wife! Each, perhaps, a new mate in eye, and rejoicing &s;ecretly in the manumi&s;&s;ion, could <HI>afford</HI> to be complai&s;antly-&s;orrowful in appearance.
<Q>He pre&s;ented <HI>her</HI> with this jewel, it will be &s;aid by the reporter, for <HI>example</HI> &s;ake: She <HI>him</HI> with that: How <HI>he</HI> wept! How <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;obb'd! How they looked after one another!</Q>
Yet, that's the je&s;t of it, neither of them wi&s;h|ing to &s;tand another twelvemonth's trial.</P>
<P>And if giddy fellows, or giddy girls, mi&s;behave in a fir&s;t marriage, whether from <HI>novice&s;hip,</HI> having expected to find more in the matter than can be found; or from <HI>perver&s;ene&s;s</HI> on <HI>her</HI> part, or <HI>po&s;itivene&s;s</HI> on <HI>his,</HI> each being mi&s;taken in the other [A mighty difference, Jack, in the &s;ame per&s;on, an <HI>inmate,</HI> or a <HI>vi&s;iter</HI>]; what a fine opportunity will each have, by this &s;cheme, of recovering a lo&s;t character, and of &s;etting all right, in the next adventure?</P>
<P>And O Jack, with what joy, with what rapture, would the <HI>change|lings</HI> (or <HI>changeables,</HI> if thou like that word better) number the weeks, the days, the hours, as the annual obligation approached to its de&s;irable period!</P>
<P>As for the Spleen or Vapours, no &s;uch malady would be known or heard of. The Phy&s;ical tribe would, indeed, be the &s;ufferers, and the only &s;ufferers; &s;ince fre&s;h health and fre&s;h &s;pirits, the con&s;equences of &s;weet blood and &s;weet humours (the mind and body continually plea&s;ed with each other), would perpetually flow in; and the joys of <HI>expecta|tion,</HI> the highe&s;t of all our joys, would &s;alubriate and keep all alive.</P>
<P>But, that no Body of men might &s;uffer, the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> I thought, might turn <HI>par&s;ons,</HI> as there would be a great demand for par&s;ons. Be|&s;ides, as they would be partakers in the general benefit, they mu&s;t be &s;orry fellows indeed, if they preferred Them&s;elves to the Public.</P>
<P>Every one would be married a dozen times, at lea&s;t. Both men and women would be careful of their characters, and polite in their beha|viour, as well as delicate in their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> and elegant in their <HI>dre&s;s</HI> (a great matter each of the&s;e, let me tell thee, to keep pa&s;&s;ion alive), either to induce a <HI>renewal</HI> with the <HI>old love,</HI> or to recommend them|&s;elves to a <HI>new.</HI> While the news-papers would be crouded with para|graphs, all the world their readers, as all the world would be concerned to &s;ee <HI>who and who's together</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Ye&s;terday, for in&s;tance, enter'd into the holy &s;tate of matrimony [We &s;hould all &s;peak reverently of matrimony then] the Right Honourable Robert Earl Lovelace [I &s;hall be an Earl by that time], with her Grace the Duche&s;s dowager of Fifty-manors; his Lord|&s;hip's one and thirtieth wife.</Q>
&mdash;I &s;hall then be contented, perhaps, to take up, as it is called, with a widow. But &s;he mu&s;t not have had more than one hu&s;band neither. Thou knowe&s;t, that I am nice in the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>I know, Jack, that thou, for thy part, wilt approve of my &s;cheme.</P>
<P>As Lord M. and I, between us, have three or four Boroughs at com|mand, I think I will get into Parliament, in order to bring in a Bill for this good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither will the hou&s;es of Parliament, nor the hou&s;es of Convoca|tion, have rea&s;on to object to it. And all the Courts, whether <HI>&s;piritual</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ual, civil</HI> or <HI>uncivil,</HI> will find their account in it, when pa&s;&s;ed in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a Law.</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, Jack, I &s;hould be apprehen&s;ive of a general in&s;urrection, and that incited by the Women, were &s;uch a Bill to be thrown out.&mdash; For here is the excellency of the &s;cheme: The women will have equal rea&s;on with the men to be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t think, that <HI>old prerogative Harlowe,</HI> for example, mu&s;t not, if &s;uch a Law were in being, have pulled in his horns? &mdash; So ex|cellent a lady as he has, would never el&s;e have <HI>renewed</HI> with &s;uch a gloomy tyrant: Who, as well as all other tyrants, mu&s;t have been upon good behaviour from year to year.</P>
<P>A termagant wife, if &s;uch a Law were to pa&s;s, would be a phoenix.</P>
<P>The <HI>churches</HI> would be the only <HI>market-places</HI> for the fair &s;ex; and <HI>dome&s;tic excellence</HI> the capital recommendation.</P>
<P>Nor would there be an <HI>old maid</HI> in Great Britain, and all its terri|tories. For what an odd &s;oul mu&s;t &s;he be, who could not have her <HI>twelvemonth's trial?</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, a total alteration for the better, in the <HI>morals</HI> and <HI>way of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe</HI> in both &s;exes, mu&s;t, in a very few years, be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tary Law.</P>
<P>Who would have expected &s;uch a one from me? I wi&s;h the devil owe me not a &s;pite for it.</P>
<P>Then would not the di&s;tinction be very pretty, Jack; as in flowers; &mdash;Such a gentleman, or &s;uch a lady, is an ANNUAL&mdash;Such a one a PERENNIAL.</P>
<P>One difficulty, however, as I remember, occurred to me, upon the probability that a wife might be <HI>en&s;ient,</HI> as the lawyers call it. But thus I obviated it.</P>
<P>That no man &s;hould be allowed to marry another woman without his <HI>then</HI> wife's con&s;ent, till &s;he were brought-to-bed, and he had defray'd all incident charges; and till it was agreed upon between them, whe|ther the child &s;hould be <HI>his, hers,</HI> or the <HI>public's.</HI> The women, in this ca&s;e, to have what I call the <HI>coercive option:</HI> For I would not have it in the man's power to be a dog neither.</P>
<P>And indeed, I gave the turn of the &s;cale, in every part of my &s;cheme, in the women's favour: For dearly do I love the &s;weet rogues.</P>
<P>How infinitely more preferable this my &s;cheme, than the polygamy one of the old patriarchs; who had wives and concubines without num|ber! I believe David and Solomon had their hundreds <HI>at a time.</HI> Had they not, Jack?</P>
<P>Let me add, That <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI> and <HI>annual Marriages,</HI> are the projects next my heart. How could I expatiate upon the benefits that would ari&s;e from both!</P></NOTE>?</P>

<P>WELL, but now my plots thicken; and my employment of writing to thee on this &s;ubject will &s;oon come to a conclu&s;ion. For now, having got the licence; and Mrs. Town&s;end, with her tars, being to come to Ham&s;tead next Wedne&s;day or Thur&s;day; and another letter po&s;&s;ibly, or me&s;&s;age, from Mi&s;&s; Howe, to inquire how Mi&s;s Harlowe does, upon the ru&s;tic's report of her ill health, and to ex|pre&s;s her wonder, that &s;he has not heard from her, in an&s;wer to hers on her e&s;cape;&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;oon blow up the lady, or be blown up my&s;elf. And &s;o I am preparing, with Lady Betty and my cou&s;in Monta|gue, to wait upon my Beloved with a coach and four, or a &s;et; for Lady Betty will not &s;tir out with a pair, for the world; tho' but for two or three miles. And this is a well-known part of her character.</P>
<P>But as to her arms and cre&s;t upon the coach and trappings?</P>
<P>Do&s;t thou not know, that a Blunt's mu&s;t &s;upply her, while her own is new-lining and repairing? An opportunity &s;he is willing to take now &s;he is in town. Nothing of this kind can be done to her mind in the country. Liveries nearly Lady Betty's.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t &s;een Lady Betty Lawrance &s;everal times&mdash;Ha&s;t thou not, Belford?</P>
<P>No, never in my life.</P>
<P>But thou ha&s;t; and lain with her too; or fame does thee more credit than thou de&s;erve&s;t &mdash; Why, Jack, knowe&s;t thou not Lady Betty's other name?</P>
<P><HI>Other</HI> name!&mdash;Has &s;he two?</P>
<P>She has. And what thinke&s;t thou of Lady Bab. Wallis?</P>
<P>O the devil!</P>
<P>Now thou ha&s;t it. Lady Barbara, thou knowe&s;t,

lifted up in circum&s;tances, and by pride, never ap|pears, or produces her&s;elf, but on occa&s;ions &s;pecial&mdash; To pa&s;s to men of quality or price, for a duche&s;s, or counte&s;s, at lea&s;t. She has always been admired for a grandeur in her air, that few women of quality can come up to: And never was &s;uppo&s;ed to be other than what &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for; tho' often and often a pa|ramour for Lords.</P>
<P>And who, thinke&s;t thou, is my cou&s;in Montague?</P>
<P>Nay, how &s;hould I know?</P>
<P>How indeed! Why, my little Johanetta Gold|ing, a lively, yet mode&s;t-looking girl, is my cou&s;in Montague.</P>
<P>There, Belford, is an aunt!&mdash;There's a cou&s;in! Both have wit at will. Both are accu&s;tomed to ape quality. Both are genteelly de&s;cended.

And in their own conceit, when a&s;&s;uming top parts, the very quality they ape.</P>
<P>And how do&s;t think I dre&s;s them out? &mdash; I'll tell thee.</P>
<P>Lady Betty in a rich gold ti&s;&s;ue, adorned with jewels of high price.</P>

<P>Johanetta, thou knowe&s;t, has a good complexion, a fine neck, and ears remarkably fine.&mdash;So has Char|lotte. She is nearly of Charlotte's &s;tature too.</P>
<P>Laces both, the riche&s;t that could be procured.</P>
<P>Thou can&s;t not imagine what a &s;um the loan of the jewels co&s;t me; tho' but for three days.</P>

<P>Had&s;t thou &s;een how they paraded it&mdash;Cou&s;in, and Cou&s;in, and Nephew, at every word; Lady Betty bridling and looking haughtily-conde&s;cending: Char|lotte galanting her fan, and &s;wimming over the floor without touching it.</P>

There will be no pa&s;&s;ion in <HI>this ca&s;e</HI> to blind the judgment, and to help on medi|tated delu&s;ion, as when you engage with titled &s;in|ners. My charmer is as cool and as di&s;tingui&s;hing, tho' not quite &s;o learned in her own &s;ex, as I am. Your commonly-a&s;&s;umed dignity won't do for me now. Airs of &s;uperiority, as if <HI>born</HI> to rank. &mdash; But no over-do!&mdash;Doubting nothing. Let not your faces arraign your hearts.</P>
<P>Ea&s;y and unaffected!&mdash;Your very dre&s;&s;es will give you pride enough.</P>

<P>Now for <HI>your</HI> part, cou&s;in Charlotte!&mdash;</P>
<P>Pretty well. But a little too frolicky that air&mdash; Yet have I prepared my Beloved to expect in you both, great vivacity and quality-freedom.</P>
<P>Cur&s;e tho&s;e eyes!&mdash;Tho&s;e glancings will never do. A down-ca&s;t ba&s;hful turn, if you can command it&mdash; Look upon me. Suppo&s;e me now to be my Beloved.</P>
<P>Devil take that leer. Too <HI>&s;ignificantly</HI> arch!&mdash; Once I knew you the girl I would now have you to be.</P>
<P>Sprightly, but not confident, cou&s;in Charlotte!&mdash; Be &s;ure forget not to look down, or a&s;ide, when looked at. When eyes meet eyes, be yours the re|treating ones. Your face will bear examination.</P>
<P>O Lord! O Lord! that &s;o young a creature can &s;o &s;oon forget the innocent appearance &s;he fir&s;t charmed by; and which I thought born with you all! &mdash; Five years to ruin what Twenty had been building up! How natural the latter le&s;&s;on! How difficult to regain the former!</P>

<Q><LG>
<L>That's my dear!</L>
<L>Study that air in the pier-gla&s;s!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Charming!&mdash;Perfectly right!</L>
<L>Your honours, now, devils!&mdash;</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Pretty well, cou&s;in Charlotte, for a young country lady!&mdash;Till form yields to familiarity, you <HI>may</HI> cour|te&s;y low. You mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have forgot your boarding-&s;chool airs.</P>
<P>But too low, too low, Lady Betty, for your years and your quality. The common fault of your &s;ex will be your danger: Aiming to be young too long! &mdash;The devil's in you all, when you judge of your|&s;elves by your wi&s;hes, and by your vanity! Fifty will then never be more than Fifteen.</P>
<P>Graceful ea&s;e, con&s;cious dignity, like that of my charmer, O how hard to hit!</P>
<P>Both together now&mdash;</P>
<P>Charming!&mdash;That's the air, Lady Betty!&mdash;That's the cue, cou&s;in Charlotte, &s;uited to the character of each!&mdash;But, once more, be &s;ure to have a guard upon your eyes.</P>

for a week at lea&s;t, or till they can prevail upon the dear Perver&s;e, as they hope they &s;hall, to re&s;tore me to her favour, and to accompany Lady Betty to Ox|ford&s;hire.</P>
<P>The dear creature has thus far conde&s;cended&mdash; That &s;he will write to Mi&s;s Howe, and acquaint her with the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things.</P>
<P>If &s;he write, I &s;hall &s;ee what &s;he writes. But I believe &s;he will have other employment &s;oon.</P>
<P>Lady Betty is &s;ure, &s;he tells her, that &s;he &s;hall prevail upon her to forgive me; tho' &s;he dares &s;ay, that I de&s;erve not forgivene&s;s. Lady Betty is too de|licate to inquire &s;trictly into the nature of my offence. But it mu&s;t be an offence again&s;t her&s;elf, again&s;t Mi&s;s Montague, again&s;t the virtuous of the whole Sex, or it could not be &s;o highly re&s;ented. Yet &s;he will not leave her till &s;he forgive me, and till &s;he &s;ee our nuptials privately celebrated. Mean time, as &s;he approves of her <HI>uncle's expedient,</HI> &s;he will addre&s;s her as <HI>already my wife, before &s;trangers.</HI></P>
<P>Stedman her &s;olicitor may attend her for orders, in relation to her Chancery-affair, at Ham&s;tead. Not one hour they <HI>can</HI> be favoured with, will they lo&s;e from the company and conver&s;ation of &s;o dear, &s;o charming a new relation.</P>
<P>Hard then if &s;he had not obliged them with her company, in their coach-and-four, to and from their cou&s;in Lee&s;on's, who longed (as they them&s;elves had done) to &s;ee a lady &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated!</P>
<P>'How will Lord M. be raptured when he &s;ees her, 'and can &s;alute her as his niece!</P>
<Q>How will Lady Sarah ble&s;s her&s;elf!&mdash;She will now think her lo&s;s of the dear daughter &s;he mourns for, happily &s;upplied!</Q>
<P>Mi&s;s Montague dwells upon every word that falls from her lips. She perfectly adores her new cou&s;in:
<Q>For her cou&s;in &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be. And her cou&s;in will &s;he call her! She an&s;wers for equal admiration in her &s;i&s;ter Patty.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214">
<Q>Ay, cry I (whi&s;pering loud enough for her to hear), how will my cou&s;in Patty's dove's eyes gli|&s;ten, and run over, on the very fir&s;t interview! &mdash; So gracious, &s;o noble, &s;o unaffected a dear creature!</Q></P>
<P>"What a happy family," chorus we all,
<Q>will ours be!</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch-like congratulatory admirations, every hour repeated: Her mode&s;ty hurt by the ec&s;ta|tic prai&s;es:&mdash;
<Q>Her graces are too natural to her&s;elf, for her to be proud of them:&mdash;But &s;he mu&s;t be content to be puni&s;hed for excellencies that ca&s;t a &s;hade upon the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> excellent!</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, we are here, as at Ham&s;tead, all joy and rapture: All of us, except my beloved, in who&s;e &s;weet face [her almo&s;t fainting reluctance to re-enter the&s;e doors not overcome] reigns a kind of anxious &s;erenity! &mdash; But how will even <HI>that</HI> be changed in a few hours!</P>
<P>Methinks I begin to pity the half-apprehen&s;ive Beauty!&mdash;But avaunt, thou un&s;ea&s;onably-intruding pity! Thou ha&s;t more than once, already, well nigh undone me! &mdash;And, Adieu reflection! Begone con|&s;ideration! and commi&s;eration! I di&s;mi&s;s ye all, for, at lea&s;t, a week to come!&mdash;Be remembred her broken word! Her flight, when my fond &s;oul was medi|tating mercy to her!&mdash;Be remembred her treatment of me, in her letter on her e&s;cape to Ham&s;tead!&mdash; Her Ham&s;tead virulence!&mdash;What is it &s;he ought not to expect from an unchained Beelzebub, and a plot|ting villain?</P>
<P>Be her preference of the &s;ingle life to <HI>me,</HI> al&s;o re|membred!&mdash;That &s;he de&s;pi&s;es me!&mdash;That &s;he even refu&s;es to be my WIFE!&mdash;A proud Lovelace to be denied a <HI>Wife!</HI> &mdash; To be more proudly rejected by a daughter of the <HI>Harlowes</HI>!&mdash;The ladies of my own family [She thinks them the ladies of my family] &s;up|plicating in vain for her returning favour to their de|&s;pi&s;ed kin&s;man, and taking laws from her &s;till prouder punctilio!</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215">Be the execrations of her vixen friend likewi&s;e re|membred, poured out upon me from <HI>her</HI> repre&s;en|tations, and thereby made her <HI>own</HI> execrations!</P>
<P>Be remembred &s;till more particularly, the Town|&s;end plot, &s;et on foot between them, and now, in a day or two, ready to break out; and the <HI>&s;ordid threat|enings</HI> thrown out again&s;t me by that little fury.</P>
<P>Is not <HI>this</HI> the cri&s;is for which I have been long waiting? Shall Tomlin&s;on, &s;hall the&s;e women, be engaged; &s;hall &s;o many engines be &s;et at work, at an immen&s;e expence, with infinite contrivance; and all to no purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Is not <HI>this</HI> the hour of her trial &mdash; And in <HI>her,</HI> of the trial of the virtue of her whole Sex, &s;o long pre|meditated, &s;o long threatened? &mdash; Whether her fro&s;t is fro&s;t indeed?

<P>Now is the end of purpo&s;es long over-awed, often &s;u&s;pended, at hand. And need I to throw the &s;ins of her cur&s;ed family into the too weighty &s;cale?</P>
<P><HI>Abhorred be force!&mdash;Be the thoughts of force!

Can &s;he re&s;ent the <HI>la&s;t outrage</HI> more than &s;he has re&s;ented a <HI>fainter effort?</HI>&mdash;And if her re&s;entments run ever &s;o high, cannot I repair by matrimony?&mdash;She will not refu&s;e me, I know, Jack; the haughty Beauty will not re|fu&s;e me, when her pride of being corporally invio|late is brought down; when &s;he can tell no tales, but when (be her re&s;i&s;tance what it will) even her own &s;ex will &s;u&s;pect a yielding in re&s;i&s;tance; and
<PB N="215" REF="216">
when that mode&s;ty, which may fill her bo&s;om with re&s;entment, will lock up her &s;peech.</P>

<LETTER>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday Night.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EXcu&s;e us, dear nephew, I be&s;eech you, to my deare&s;t kin&s;woman. One night cannot break &s;quares. For here Mi&s;s Montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits, one after an|other. The hurry of her joy, I believe, to find your dear lady &s;o much &s;urpa&s;s all expectation (Never did family-love, you know, reign &s;o &s;trong, as among us), and the too eager de&s;ire &s;he had to attend her, have
<PB N="217" REF="218">
occa&s;ioned it: For &s;he has but weak &s;pirits, poor girl! well as &s;he looks.</P>
<P>If &s;he be better, we will certainly go with you to|morrow morning, after we have breakfa&s;ted with her, at your lodgings. But, whether &s;he be, or not, I will do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to attend your lady to Ham&s;tead; and will be with you, for that purpo&s;e, about nine in the morning. With due compliments to your mo&s;t worthily beloved, I am</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours affectionately, <HI>ELIZAB. LAWRANCE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Faith and troth, Jack, I know not what to do with my&s;elf: For here, ju&s;t now, having &s;ent in the above note by Dorcas, out came my beloved with it in her hand: In a fit of phren&s;y!&mdash;True, by my &s;oul!</P>
<P>She had indeed complained of her head all the evening.</P>
<P>Dorcas ran to me, out of breath, to tell me, that her lady was coming in &s;ome &s;trange way: But &s;he followed her &s;o quick, that the frighted wench had not time to &s;ay in what way.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, when &s;he read the billet&mdash;Now indeed, &s;aid &s;he, am I a lo&s;t creature! O the poor Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!</P>
<P>She tore off her head-cloaths; inquired where I was: And in &s;he came, her &s;hining tre&s;&s;es flowing about her neck; her ruffles torn, and hanging in tatters about her &s;nowy hands; with her arms &s;pread out; her eyes wildly turned, as if &s;tarting from their orbits&mdash;Down &s;unk &s;he at my feet, as &s;oon as &s;he approached me; her charming bo&s;om heaving to her uplifted face; and, cla&s;ping her arms about my knees, Dear Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, if ever&mdash;if ever&mdash;if ever&mdash;And, unable to &s;peak another word, quitting her cla&s;ping hold, down pro&s;trate on the floor &s;unk &s;he, neither in a fit nor out of one.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="219">I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed.&mdash;All my purpo&s;es &s;u&s;|pended for a few moments, I knew neither what to &s;ay, nor what to do. But, recollecting my&s;elf, Am I <HI>again,</HI> thought I, in a way to be overcome, and made a fool of!&mdash;If I now recede, I am gone for ever.</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed her: But down &s;he &s;unk, as if quite di&s;|jointed; her limbs failing her&mdash;yet not in a fit nei|ther. I never heard of, or &s;aw, &s;uch a dear unac|countable: Almo&s;t lifele&s;s, and &s;peechle&s;s too for a few moments!&mdash;What mu&s;t her apprehen&s;ions be at that moment! And for what? &mdash; An high-notioned dear &s;oul!&mdash;Pretty ignorance! thought I.</P>
<P>Never having met with a repugnance &s;o <HI>greatly</HI> repugnant, I was &s;tagger'd &mdash; I was confounded &mdash; Yet how &s;hould I know that it would be &s;o till I try'd?&mdash;And how, having proceeded thus far, could I &s;top, were I <HI>not</HI> to have had the women to goad me on, and to make light of circum&s;tances, which they pretended to be better judges of than me.</P>
<P>I lifted her, however, into a chair; and, in words of di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ion, told her, All her fears were needle&s;s: Wondered at them: Begg'd of her to be pacified: Be&s;ought her reliance on my faith and ho|nour: And re-vowed all my old vows, and poured forth new ones.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, with an heart-breaking &s;ob, I &s;ee, I &s;ee, Mr. Lovelace, in broken &s;entences &s;he &s;poke&mdash;I &s;ee, I &s;ee&mdash;that at la&s;t&mdash;at la&s;t&mdash;I am ruined!&mdash;Ruined &mdash; If <HI>your</HI> pity&mdash;Let me implore your pity!&mdash;And down on her bo&s;om, like a half-broken-&s;talk'd lily, top-heavy with the overcharging dews of the morning, &s;unk her head, with a &s;igh that went to my heart.</P>
<P>All I could think of to re-a&s;&s;ure her, when a little recovered, I &s;aid.</P>
<P>Why did I not &s;end for their coach, as I had inti|mated? It might return in the morning for the ladies.</P>
<P>I had actually done &s;o, I told her, on &s;eeing her
<PB N="219" REF="220">
&s;trange unea&s;ine&s;s. But it was then gone to fetch a doctor for Mi&s;s Montague, le&s;t his chariot &s;hould not be &s;o ready.</P>
<P>An! Lovelace! &s;aid &s;he, with a doubting face; angui&s;h in her imploring eye.</P>
<P>Lady Betty would think it very &s;trange, I told her, if &s;he were to know it was &s;o di&s;agreeable to her to &s;tay one night, for <HI>her</HI> company, in a hou&s;e where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;o many!</HI></P>
<P>She called me names upon this.&mdash;She had called me names before.&mdash;I was patient.</P>
<P>Let her go to Lady Betty's lodgings, then; <HI>di|rectly</HI> go; if the per&s;on I called Lady Betty was really Lady Betty.</P>
<P>IF! my dear! Good Heaven! What a villain does that IF &s;hew you believe me to be!</P>
<P>I cannot help it&mdash;I be&s;eech you once more, Let me go to Mrs. Lee&s;on's, if <HI>that</HI> IF ought not to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>Then a&s;&s;uming a more re&s;olute &s;pirit&mdash;I will go! I will inquire my way!&mdash;I will go by my&s;elf!&mdash;And would have ru&s;hed by me.</P>
<P>I folded my arms about her to detain her; plead|ing the bad way I heard poor Charlotte was in; and what a farther concern her impatience, if &s;he went, would give her.</P>
<P>She would believe nothing I &s;aid, unle&s;s I would in&s;tantly order a coach (&s;ince &s;he was not to have Lady Betty's, nor was permitted to go to Mrs. Lee|&s;on's), and let her go in it to Ham&s;tead, late as it was; and all alone; &s;o much the better: For in the hou&s;e of <HI>people,</HI> of whom Lady Betty, upon inquiry, had heard a bad character [<HI>Dropt fooli&s;hly This, by my prating new relation, in order to do credit to her|&s;elf, by depreciating others</HI>]; every thing, and every face, looking with &s;o much meaning vilene&s;s, as well as <HI>my own [Thou art &s;till too &s;en&s;ible, thought I, my
<PB N="220" REF="221">
charmer!</HI>], &s;he was re&s;olved not to &s;tay another night.</P>
<P>Dreading what might happen as to her intellects, and being very apprehen&s;ive, that &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly go thro' a great deal before morning (tho' more violent &s;he could not well be with the wor&s;t &s;he dreaded), I humoured her, and ordered Will. to go and endeavour to get a coach directly, to carry us to Ham&s;tead; I cared not at what price.</P>
<P>Robbers, whom I would have terrify'd her with, &s;he feared not&mdash;<HI>I</HI> was all her fear, I found; and this hou&s;e her terror: For I &s;aw plainly, that &s;he now believed, that Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Montague were both impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>But her mi&s;tru&s;t is a little of the late&s;t to do her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And, O Jack, the rage of Love, the rage of Re|venge is upon me! By turns they tear me!&mdash;The progre&s;s already made! &mdash; The womens in&s;tigations!&mdash; The power I &s;hall have to try her to the utmo&s;t, and &s;till to marry her, if &s;he be not to be brought to co|habitation.! &mdash; Let me peri&s;h, Belford, if &s;he e&s;cape me now!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>WILL. is not yet come back.&mdash;Near eleven.&mdash;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>WILL. is this moment returned.&mdash;No coach to be got, <HI>for love or money.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, &s;he urges&mdash;To Mrs. Lee&s;on's let me go!&mdash;Lovelace! Good Lovelace! Let me go to Mrs. Lee&s;on's!&mdash;What is Mi&s;s Montague's illne&s;s to my terror?&mdash;For the Almighty's &s;ake, Mr. Lovelace!&mdash; her hands cla&s;ped&mdash;</P>
<P>O my angel! What a wildne&s;s is this!&mdash;Do you know, do you &s;ee, my deare&s;t life, what an appear|ance your cau&s;ele&s;s apprehen&s;ions have given you?&mdash; Do you know it is pa&s;t eleven o'clock?</P>
<P>Twelve, one, two, three, four&mdash;any hour&mdash;I
<PB N="221" REF="222">
care not&mdash;If you mean me honourably, let me go cut of this hated hou&s;e!</P>
<P>Thou'lt ob&s;erve, Belford, that tho' this was writ|ten afterwards, yet (as in other places) I write it as it was &s;poken, and happened; as if I had retired to put down every &s;entence as &s;poken. I know thou like&s;t this lively <HI>pre&s;ent-ten&s;e</HI> manner, as it is one of my peculiars.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he had repeated the la&s;t words, <HI>If you mean me honourably, let me go out of this hated hou&s;e,</HI> in came Mrs. Sinclair, in a great ferment.&mdash;And what, pray, Madam, has <HI>this hou&s;e</HI> done to you? &mdash; Mr. Lovelace, you have known me &s;ome time; and, if I have not the nicene&s;s of this lady, I hope I do not de&s;erve to be treated thus!</P>
<P>She &s;et her huge arms a-kembo: <HI>Hoh!</HI> Madam, let me tell you, I am amazed at your freedoms with my character! And, Mr. Lovelace (holding up, and violently &s;haking, her head), if you are a gentle|man, and a man of honour&mdash;</P>
<P>Having never before &s;een any thing but ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s in this woman, little as &s;he liked her, &s;he was frighted at her ma&s;culine air, and fierce look&mdash;God help me! cry'd &s;he. What will become of me now! Then, turning her head hither and thither, in a wild kind of amaze, Whom have I for a protector! What will become of me now!</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> will be your protector, my deare&s;t love!&mdash;But indeed you are uncharitably &s;evere upon poor Mrs. Sinclair! Indeed you are!&mdash;She is a gentlewoman born, and the relict of a man of honour; and tho' left in &s;uch circum&s;tances as oblige her to let lodg|ings, yet would &s;he &s;corn to be guilty of a wilful ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>I hope &s;o&mdash;it may be &s;o&mdash;I may be mi&s;taken&mdash; But&mdash;But there is no crime, I pre&s;ume, no trea&s;on, to &s;ay I don't like her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The old dragon &s;traddled up to her, with her arms
<PB N="222" REF="223">
kembo'd again&mdash;Her eye-brows erect, like the bu|&s;tles upon a hog's back, and, &s;couling over her &s;hor|tened no&s;e, more than half-hid her ferret eyes. Her mouth was di&s;torted. She pouted out her blubber-lips, as if to bellows up wind and &s;putter into her hor&s;e-no&s;trils; and her chin was curdled, and more than u&s;ually prominent with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>With two <HI>Hoh-Madams</HI> &s;he acco&s;ted the frighted fair-one; who, terrified, caught hold of my &s;leeve.</P>
<P>I feared &s;he would fall into fits; and, with a look of indignation, told Mrs. Sinclair, that the&s;e apart|ments were mine; and I could not imagine what &s;he meant, either by li&s;tening to what pa&s;&s;ed between me and my &s;pou&s;e, or to come in, uninvited; much le&s;s to give her&s;elf the&s;e violent airs.</P>
<P>I may be to blame, Jack, for &s;uffering this wretch to give her&s;elf the&s;e airs: but her coming in was without my orders.</P>
<P>The old Beldam, throwing her&s;elf into a chair, fell a blubbering and exclaiming. And the pacifying of her, and endeavouring to reconcile the lady to her, took up till near one a clock.</P>
<P>And thus, between terror, and the late hour, and what followed, &s;he was diverted from the thoughts of getting out of the hou&s;e to Mrs. Lee&s;on's, or any|where el&s;e.</P>

<P>O Thou &s;avage-hearted mon&s;ter! What work ha&s;t thou made in <HI>one guilty hour,</HI> for a <HI>whole age</HI> of repentance!</P>
<P>I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly concerned at the fate of this matchle&s;s lady! She could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing, and &s;uffered as &s;he has done with thee.</P>
<P>I had written a great part of another long letter, to try to &s;often thy flinty heart in her favour; for I thought it but too likely, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ucceed in getting her back again to the accur&s;ed woman's. But I find it would have been too late, had I fini&s;hed it, and &s;ent it away. Yet cannot I forbear writing, to urge thee to make the <HI>only</HI> amends thou now can&s;t make her, by a proper u&s;e of the Licen&s;e thou ha&s;t obtained.</P>
<P>Poor, poor lady! It is a pain to me, that I ever &s;aw her. Such an adorer of virtue to be &s;acrificed to the vile&s;t of her &s;ex; and thou their implement in the devil's hands, for a purpo&s;e &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o ungene|rous, &s;o inhumane! &mdash; Pride thy&s;elf, O cruelle&s;t of men, in this reflection; and that thy triumph over a lady, who for thy &s;ake was abandoned of every friend &s;he had in the world, was effected, not by advantages taken of her weakne&s;s and credulity; but by the blacke&s;t artifice; after a long cour&s;e of &s;tudied deceits had been tried to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I can tell thee, it is well either for thee or for me, that I am not the brother of the lady. Had I been her brother, her violation mu&s;t have been followed by the blood of one of us.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Lovelace; and let not the lady fare the wor&s;e for my concern for her. And yet I have
<PB N="224" REF="225">
but one <HI>other</HI> motive to a&s;k thy excu&s;e; and that is, becau&s;e I owe to thy own communicative pen the knowlege I have of thy barbarous villainy; &s;ince thou might'&s;t, if thou would'&s;t, have pa&s;&s;ed it upon me for a common &s;eduction.</P>
<P>CLARISSA LIVES, thou &s;ay'&s;t. That &s;he does, is my wonder; and the&s;e words &s;hew, that thou thy&s;elf (tho' thou could&s;t, neverthele&s;s, proceed) hardly expected&s;t &s;he would have &s;urvived the outrage. What mu&s;t have been the poor lady's di&s;tre&s;s (watch|ful as &s;he had been over her honour), when dread|ful certainty took place of cruel apprehen&s;ion!&mdash;And yet a man may gue&s;s what it mu&s;t have been, by that which thou painte&s;t, when &s;he &s;u&s;pected her&s;elf trick'd, de&s;erted, and betrayed, by thy pretended aunt and cou&s;in.</P>
<P>That thou could&s;t behold her phren&s;y on this oc|ca&s;ion, and her half-&s;peechle&s;s, half-fainting pro&s;tra|tion at thy feet, and yet retain thy evil purpo&s;es, will hardly be thought credible, even by tho&s;e who know <HI>thee,</HI> if they have &s;een <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>Poor, poor Lady! With &s;uch noble qualities as would have adorned the mo&s;t exalted married life, to fall into the hands of the <HI>only</HI> man in the world, who could have treated her as thou ha&s;t treated her!&mdash; And to let loo&s;e the old dragon, as thou properly calle&s;t her, upon the before-affrighted innocent, what a barbarity was <HI>that!</HI> What a <HI>poor</HI> piece of barba|rity! in order to obtain by terror, what thou de|&s;paired&s;t to do by love, tho' &s;upported by &s;tratagems the mo&s;t in&s;idious!</P>
<P><HI>O</HI> LOVELACE! LOVELACE! <HI>had I doubted it before, I &s;hould now be convinced, that there mu&s;t be a</HI> WORLD AFTER THIS, <HI>to do ju&s;tice to injured me|rit, and to puni&s;h &s;uch a barbarous perfidy!</HI> Could the divine SOCRATES, and the divine CLARISSA, other|wi&s;e have &s;uffered?</P>
<P>But let me, if po&s;&s;ible, for one moment, try to
<PB N="225" REF="226">
forget this villainous outrage on the mo&s;t excellent of women.</P>
<P>I have bu&s;ine&s;s here, which will hold me yet a few days; and then perhaps I &s;hall quit this hou&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>I have had a &s;olemn and tedious time of it. I &s;hould never have known, that I had half the re&s;pect I really find I had for the old gentleman, had I not &s;o clo&s;ely, at his earne&s;t de&s;ire, attended him, and been a witne&s;s of the tortures he underwent.</P>
<P>This melancholy occa&s;ion may po&s;&s;ibly have con|tributed to humanize me: But &s;urely I never could have been &s;o remor&s;ele&s;s a caitiff as <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t been, to a woman of <HI>half</HI> this lady's excellence.</P>
<P>But pr'ythee, dear Lovelace, if thou'rt a man, and not a devil, re&s;olve, out of hand, to repair thy &s;in of ingratitude, by conferring upon thy&s;elf the highe&s;t honour thou <HI>can&s;t</HI> receive, in making her lawfully thine.</P>
<P>But if thou can&s;t not prevail upon thy&s;elf to do her this ju&s;tice, I think I &s;hould not &s;cruple a tilt with thee (An everla&s;ting rupture at lea&s;t mu&s;t follow), if thou &s;acrifice&s;t her to the accur&s;ed women.</P>
<P>Thou art de&s;irous to know what advantage I reap by my uncle's demi&s;e. I do not certainly know; for I have not been &s;o greedily &s;ollicitous on this &s;ub|ject, as &s;ome of the kindred have been, who ought to have &s;hewn more decency, as I have told them, and &s;uffered the corp&s;e to have been cold before they had begun their hungry inquiries. But, by what I gathered from the poor man's talk to me, who, oftener than I wi&s;hed, touched upon the &s;ubject, I deem it will be upwards of 5000 <HI>l.</HI> in ca&s;h, and in the funds, after all legacies paid, be&s;ides the real e&s;tate, which is a clear 500 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h from my heart, thou wert a money-lover! Were the e&s;tate to be of double the value, thou &s;hould&s;t have it every &s;hilling; only upon one con|dition

<P>Think of this, my dear Lovelace: Be hone&s;t: And let me pre&s;ent thee with the brighte&s;t jewel that man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and then, body and &s;oul, wilt thou bind to thee for ever, thy</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, June</HI> 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LET me alone, you great dog, you!&mdash;Let me alone!&mdash;have I heard a le&s;&s;er boy, his coward arms held over his head and face, &s;ay to a bigger, who was pummeling him, for having run away with his apple, his orange, or his ginger-bread.</P>
<P>So &s;ay I to thee, on occa&s;ion of thy &s;everity to thy poor friend, who, as thou owne&s;t, has furni&s;hed thee (ungenerous as thou art!) with the weapons thou brandi&s;he&s;t &s;o fearfully again&s;t him.&mdash;And to what purpo&s;e, when the mi&s;chief is done; when, of con&s;equence, the affair is irretrievable? and when a CLARISSA could not move me?</P>
<P>Well, but, after all, I mu&s;t own, that there is &s;omething very &s;ingular in this lady's ca&s;e: And, at times, I cannot help regretting, that I ever attempted her; &s;ince not one power either of body or &s;oul could be moved in my favour; and &s;ince, to u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the philo&s;opher, on a much graver occa|&s;ion, There is no difference to be found between the &s;kull of king Philip, and that of another man.</P>
<P>But peoples extravagant notions of things alter not facts, Belford: And, when all's done, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe has but run the fate of a thou&s;and others of her Sex&mdash;Only that they did not &s;et &s;uch a roman|tic
<PB N="227" REF="228">
value upon what they call their <HI>honour</HI>; that's all.</P>
<P>And yet I will allow thee this&mdash;That if a per&s;on &s;ets a high value upon any thing, be it ever &s;uch a trifle in it&s;elf, or in the eye of others, the robbing of that per&s;on of it is <HI>not</HI> a trifle to <HI>him.</HI> Take the mat|ter in this light, I own I have done wrong, great wrong, to this admirable creature.</P>
<P>But have I not known twenty and twenty of the &s;ex, who have &s;eemed to carry their notions of vir|tue high; yet, when brought to the te&s;t, have abated of their &s;everity? And how &s;hould we be convinced that <HI>any</HI> of them are proof, till they are try'd?</P>
<P>A thou&s;and times have I &s;aid, that I never yet met with &s;uch a woman as this. If I <HI>had,</HI> I hardly ever &s;hould have attempted Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe. Hitherto &s;he is all angel: And was not that the point which at &s;etting out I propo&s;ed to try <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 111.</NOTE>? And was not <HI>cohabitation</HI> ever my darling view? And am I not now, at la&s;t, in the high-road to it?&mdash;It is true, that I have nothing to boa&s;t of as to her will. The very contrary. But now are we come to the te&s;t, whe|ther &s;he cannot be brought to make the be&s;t of an irreparable evil?&mdash;If &s;he exclaim (&s;he has rea&s;on to exclaim, and I will &s;it down with patience, by the hour together, to hear her exclamations, till &s;he is tired of them), &s;he will then de&s;cend to expo&s;tula|tion perhaps: Expo&s;tulation will give me hope: Ex|po&s;tulation will &s;hew, that &s;he hates me not. And if &s;he hate me not, &s;he will forgive: And if &s;he <HI>now</HI> forgive; then will all be over; and &s;he will be mine upon my own terms: And it &s;hall then be the whole &s;tudy of my future life to make her happy.</P>
<P>So, Belford, thou &s;ee&s;t; that I have journeyed on to this &s;tage (indeed, thro' infinite mazes, and as in|finite remor&s;es), with one determined point in view, from the fir&s;t. To thy urgent &s;upplication then, that
<PB N="228" REF="229">
I will do her grateful ju&s;tice by marriage, let me an|&s;wer in Matt. Prior's two lines on his hoped-for Au|ditor&s;hip; as put into the mouths of his St. John and Harley;
<Q><L>&mdash;Let that be done, which Matt, doth &s;ay.</L>
<L><HI>YEA,</HI> quoth the Earl&mdash;<HI>BUT NOT TO-DAY.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, that I make no re&s;olutions, however, again&s;t doing her, one time or other, the wi&s;h'd-for ju&s;tice, even were I to &s;ucceed in my prin|cipal view, <HI>cohabitation.</HI> And of this I do a&s;&s;ure thee, that, if I ever marry, it mu&s;t, it &s;hall, be Mi&s;s Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe.&mdash;Nor is her honour at all impaired with <HI>me,</HI> by what &s;he has <HI>&s;o far</HI> &s;uffered: But the contrary. She mu&s;t only take care, that, if &s;he be at la&s;t brought to forgive me, &s;he &s;hew me, that her Lovelace is the only man on earth, whom &s;he could have forgiven on the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, ah, Jack! what, in the mean time, &s;hall I do with this admirable creature? At pre&s;ent &mdash; I am loth to &s;ay it&mdash;But, at pre&s;ent, &s;he is quite &s;tupefied.</P>
<P>I had rather, methinks, &s;he &s;hould have retained all her active powers, tho' I had &s;uffered by her nails and her teeth, than that &s;he &s;hould be &s;unk into &s;uch a &s;tate of ab&s;olute&mdash;in&s;en&s;ibility (&s;hall I call it), as &s;he has been in ever &s;ince Tue&s;day morning. Yet, as &s;he begins a little to revive, and now-and-then to call names, and to exclaim, I dread almo&s;t to en|gage with the angui&s;h of a &s;pirit that owes its extra|ordinary agitations to a nicene&s;s that has no example either in antient or modern &s;tory. For, after all, what is there in her ca&s;e, that &s;hould <HI>&s;tupefy</HI> &s;uch a glowing, &s;uch a <HI>blooming</HI> charmer?&mdash;Exce&s;s of grief, exce&s;s of terror, has made a per&s;on's hair &s;tand on end, and even (as we have read) changed the colour of it. But that it &s;hould &s;o &s;tupefy, as to make a per&s;on, at times, in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e imaginary wrongs, which would rai&s;e others <HI>from</HI> &s;tupefaction, is very &s;urpri&s;ing!</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">But I will leave this &s;ubject, le&s;t it &s;hould make me too grave.</P>
<P>I was ye&s;terday at Ham&s;tead, and di&s;charged all obligations there, with no &s;mall applau&s;e. I told them, that the lady was now as happy as my&s;elf: And that is no great untruth; for I am not altogether &s;o, when I allow my&s;elf to <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Town&s;end, with her tars, had not been then there. I told them what I would have them &s;ay to her, if &s;he come.</P>
<P>Well, but, after all (How many <HI>after-all's</HI> have I?), I could be very grave, were I to give way to it.&mdash;The devil take me for a fool! What's the mat|ter with me, I wonder!&mdash;I mu&s;t breathe a fre&s;her air for a few days.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I do with this admirable creature the while?&mdash;Hang me, if I know!&mdash; For, if I &s;tir, the venomous &s;pider of this habitation will want to &s;et upon the charming fly, who&s;e &s;ilken wings are already &s;o intangled in my enormous web, that &s;he cannot move hand or foot: For &s;o much has grief &s;tupefied her, that &s;he is at pre&s;ent as de&s;titute of will, as &s;he always &s;eemed of de&s;ire. I mu&s;t not therefore think of leaving her yet for two days toge|ther.</P>

<P>I Have ju&s;t now had a &s;pecimen of what this dear creature's re&s;entment will be, when quite reco|ver'd: An affecting one!&mdash;For, entering her apart|ment after Dorcas; and endeavouring to &s;oothe and pacify her di&s;ordered mind; in the mid&s;t of my blandi&s;h|ments, &s;he held up to Heaven, in a &s;peechle&s;s agony, the innocent Licence (which &s;he has in her own power); as the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Catalans held up their
<PB N="230" REF="231">
Engli&s;h treaty, on an occa&s;ion that keeps the wor&s;t of my actions in countenance.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed about to call down vengeance upon me; when, happily, the Leaden God, in pity to her trembling Lovelace, waved over her half-drowned eyes his &s;omniferous wand, and laid a&s;leep the fair exclaimer, before &s;he could go half thro' with her intended imprecation.</P>
<P>Thou wilt gue&s;s, by what I have written, that &s;ome <HI>little</HI> art has been made u&s;e of: But it was with a <HI>generous</HI> de&s;ign (if thou'lt allow me the word on &s;uch an occa&s;ion) in order to le&s;&s;en the too quick &s;en&s;e &s;he was likely to have of what &s;he was to &s;uffer. A contrivance I never had occa&s;ion for before, and had not thought of now, if Mrs. Sinclair had not propo&s;ed it to me: To whom I left the management of it: And I have done nothing but cur&s;e her ever &s;ince, le&s;t the quantity &s;hould have for ever damped her charming intellects.</P>
<P>Hence my concern&mdash;For I think the poor lady ought not to have been &s;o treated. <HI>Poor lady,</HI> did I &s;ay?&mdash;What have I to do with thy creeping &s;tyle?&mdash; But have not I the wor&s;t of it; &s;ince her in&s;en&s;ibility has made me but a thief to my own joys?</P>
<P>I did not intend to tell thee of this little <HI>innocent</HI> trick; for &s;uch I de&s;igned it to be; but that I hate di&s;ingenuity: To thee, e&s;pecially: And as I cannot help writing in a more &s;erious vein than u&s;ual, thou would&s;t, perhaps, had I not hinted the true cau&s;e, have imagined, that I was &s;orry for the fact it&s;elf: And this would have given <HI>thee</HI> a good deal of trou|ble in &s;cribbling dull per&s;ua&s;ives to repair by matri|mony; and <HI>me,</HI> in reading thy crude non&s;en&s;e. Be|&s;ides, one day or other, thou mighte&s;t, had I not con|fe&s;&s;ed it, have heard of it in an aggravated manner; and I know thou ha&s;t &s;uch an high opinion of this lady's virtue, that thou would&s;t be di&s;appointed, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou had&s;t rea&s;on to think, that &s;he was &s;ubdued by
<PB N="231" REF="232">
<HI>her own</HI> con&s;ent, or any the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> yielding in her will. And &s;o is &s;he beholden to me, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, that, at the expence of <HI>my</HI> honour, &s;he may &s;o ju&s;tly form a plea, which will intirely &s;alve <HI>hers?</HI></P>
<P>And now is the whole &s;ecret out.</P>
<P>Thou wilt &s;ay I am a horrid fellow!&mdash;As the lady does, that I am the <HI>unchained Beelzebub,</HI> and a <HI>plotting villain:</HI> And as this is what you both &s;aid beforehand, and nothing wor&s;e <HI>can</HI> be &s;aid, I de&s;ire, if thou would&s;t not have me quite &s;erious with thee, and that I &s;hould think thou meane&s;t more by thy tilting-hint, than I am willing to believe thou do&s;t, that thou wilt forbear thy invectives: For is not the thing done?&mdash;Can it be help'd?&mdash;And mu&s;t I not now try to make the be&s;t of it?&mdash;And the rather do I injoin thee this, and inviolable &s;ecrecy; becau&s;e I begin to think, that my puni&s;hment will be greater than the fault, were it to be only from my own reflection.</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry to hear of thy misfortune; but hope thou wilt not long lie by it. Thy &s;ervant tells me, what a narrow e&s;cape thou had&s;t with thy neck. I wi&s;h it may not be ominous: But I think thou &s;eeme&s;t not to be in &s;o enterpri&s;ing a way as for|merly; and yet, merry or &s;ad, thou &s;ee&s;t a rake's neck is always in danger, if not from the hangman, from his own hor&s;e. But 'tis a vicious toad, it &s;eems; and I think thou &s;hould&s;t never venture upon his back again; for 'tis a plaguy thing for rider and hor&s;e both to be vicious.</P>
<P>Thy fellow tells me, thou de&s;ire&s;t me to continue to write to thee, to <HI>divert</HI> thy chagrin on thy forced
<PB N="232" REF="233">
confinement: But how I can think it in my <HI>power</HI> to divert, when my &s;ubject is not plea&s;ing to my&s;elf?</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar never knew what it was to be <HI>hyp'd,</HI> I will call it, till he came to be what Pompey was; that is to &s;ay, till he arrived at the height of his ambition: Nor did thy Lovelace know what it was to be gloomy, till he had completed his wi&s;hes upon the charming'&s;t creature in the world, as the other did his upon the mo&s;t potent republic that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>And yet why &s;ay I, <HI>completed?</HI> when the <HI>will,</HI> the <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> is wanting&mdash;And I have &s;till views be|fore me of obtaining that?</P>
<P>Yet I could almo&s;t join with thee in the wi&s;h, which thou &s;ende&s;t me up by thy &s;ervant, unfriendly as it is, that I had had thy misfortune before Monday night la&s;t: For here, the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my la&s;t: For now is &s;he as much too lively, as before &s;he was too &s;tupid; and, 'bating that &s;he has pretty frequent lucid intervals, would be deem'd raving mad, and I &s;hould be obliged to confine her.</P>
<P>I am mo&s;t confoundedly di&s;turb'd about it: For I begin to fear, that her intellects are irreparably hurt.</P>
<P>Who the devil could have expected &s;uch &s;trange effects from a cau&s;e &s;o common, and &s;o &s;light?</P>
<P>But the&s;e high &s;oul'd and high-&s;ens'd girls, who had &s;et up for &s;hining lights and examples to the re&s;t of the &s;ex, [I now &s;ee, that &s;uch there are!] are with &s;uch difficulty brought down to the common &s;tandard, that a wi&s;e man, who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in &s;ubduing one of that exalted cla&s;s, would have nothing to &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>I do all in my power to quiet her &s;pirits, when I force my&s;elf into her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I go on, begging pardon one minute; and vow|ing truth and honour another.</P>
<P>I would at fir&s;t have per&s;uaded her, and offer'd to
<PB N="233" REF="234">
call witne&s;&s;es to the truth of it, that we were actually married. Tho' the licence was in her hands, I thought the a&s;&s;ertion might go down in her di&s;order; and charming con&s;equences I hoped would follow. But this would not do.&mdash;</P>
<P>I therefore gave up that hope: And now I de|clare to her, that it is my re&s;olution to marry her, the moment her uncle Harlowe informs me, that he will grace the ceremony with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But &s;he believes nothing I &s;ay; nor (whether in her &s;en&s;es, or not) bears me with patience in her &s;ight.</P>
<P>I pity her with all my &s;oul; and I cur&s;e my&s;elf, when &s;he is in her wailing fits, and when I appre|hend, that intellects, &s;o charming as hers, are for ever damp'd&mdash;But more I cur&s;e the&s;e women, who put me upon &s;uch an expedient! &mdash;Lord! Lord! what a hand have I made of it!&mdash;And all for what?</P>
<P>La&s;t night, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince Monday la&s;t, &s;he got to her pen and ink: But &s;he pur&s;ues her writing with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and hurry, as &s;hew too evidently her di&s;compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>I hope, however, that this employment will help to calm her &s;pirits.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>JUST now Dorcas tells me, that what &s;he writes &s;he tears, and throws the paper in fragments under the table, either as not knowing what &s;he does, or di&s;liking it: Then gets up, wrings her hands, weeps, and &s;hifts her &s;eat all round the room: Then returns to her table, &s;its down, and writes again.</P>

<P>What you, or Mrs. Sinclair, or &s;omebody, I cannot tell who, have done to my poor head, you be&s;t know: But I &s;hall never be what I was. My head is gone. I have wept away all my brain, I believe; for I can weep no more. Indeed I have had my full &s;hare; &s;o it is no matter.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I WILL not hear thy heavy preachments upon this plaguy letter. So, not a word of that &s;ort! The paper, thou'lt &s;ee, is bli&s;ter'd with the tears even of the harden'd tran&s;criber; which has made her ink run here-and-there.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair is a true heroine, and, I think, &s;hames us all. And &s;he is a <HI>woman</HI> too! Thou'lt &s;ay, The be&s;t things corrupted become the wor&s;t. But this is certain, that whatever the &s;ex &s;et their hearts upon, they make thorough work of it. And hence it is, that a mi&s;chief, which would end in &s;imple robbery among men-rogues, becomes murder, if a woman be in it.</P>
<P>I know thou wilt blame me for having had recour&s;e to <HI>art.</HI> But do not phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe opiates in acute ca&s;es, where the violence of the di&s;order would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium? I averr, that my motive for this expedient was <HI>mercy</HI>; nor could it be any thing el&s;e. For a Rape, thou knowe&s;t, to us Rakes, is far from being an unde&s;irable thing. Nothing but the Law
<PB N="245" REF="246">
&s;tands in our way, upon that account; and the opinion of what a mode&s;t woman will &s;uffer, rather than become a <HI>viva voce</HI> accu&s;er, le&s;&s;ens much an hone&s;t fellow's apprehen&s;ions on that &s;core. Then, if the&s;e <HI>&s;omnivolences</HI> [I hate the word <HI>opiates</HI> on this occa&s;ion] have turned her head, that is an effect they frequently have upon &s;ome con&s;titutions; and in this ca&s;e was rather the fault of the do&s;e, than the de&s;ign of the giver.</P>
<P>But is not wine it&s;elf an opiate in degree?&mdash;How many women have been taken advantage of by wine, and other &s;till more intoxicating viands?&mdash;Let me tell thee, Jack, that the <HI>experience</HI> of many of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ex, and the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of many more of the <HI>active,</HI> appealed to, will te&s;tify that thy Lovelace is not the wor&s;t of villains. Nor would I have thee put me upon clearing my&s;elf, by compari&s;ons.</P>
<P>If &s;he e&s;cape a &s;ettled delirium when my plots unravel, I think it is all I ought to be concerned about. What therefore I de&s;ire of thee, is, That, if two con&s;tructions may be made of my actions, thou wilt afford me the mo&s;t favourable. For this, not only friend&s;hip, but my own ingenuity, which has furni&s;hed thee with the knowlege of the facts, again&s;t which thou art &s;o ready to inveigh, require of thee.</P>

<P>WILL is ju&s;t returned from an errand to Ham&s;tead; and acquaints me, that Mrs. Town&s;end was ye&s;ter|day at Mrs. Moore's, accompanied by three or four rough fellows. She was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed at the news, that my &s;pou&s;e and I are intirely reconciled; and that two fine ladies, my relations, came to vi&s;it her, and went to town with her: Where &s;he is very happy with me. <HI>She</HI> was &s;ure we were not married, &s;he &s;aid, unle&s;s it was while we were at Ham&s;tead: And <HI>they</HI> were &s;ure the ceremony was not performed there. But that the Lady <HI>is</HI> happy and ea&s;y, is
<PB N="246" REF="247">
unque&s;tionable: And a fling was thrown out by Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Bevis at <HI>mi&s;chief-makers,</HI> as they knew Mrs. Town&s;end to be acquainted with Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ince my Fair-one can neither receive, nor &s;end away letters, I am pretty ea&s;y, as to this Mrs. Town&s;end, and her employer. And I fancy Mi&s;s Howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter, and afraid of &s;ending by Wil&s;on's con|veyance; and perhaps &s;uppo&s;e, that her friend &s;lights her; or has changed her mind in my favour, and is a&s;hamed to own it; as &s;he has not had an an&s;wer to what &s;he wrote; and will believe, that the ru&s;tic d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">livered her la&s;t letter into her own hand.</P>
<P>Mean time, I have a little project come into my head, of a <HI>new</HI> kind; ju&s;t for amu&s;ement-&s;ake, that's all: Variety has irre&s;i&s;tible charms. I cannot live without intrigue. My charmer has no pa&s;&s;ions; that is to &s;ay, none of the pa&s;&s;ions that I want her to have. She engages all my reverence. I am at pre|&s;ent more inclined to regret what I have done, than to proceed to new offences: And &s;hall regret it till I &s;ee how &s;he takes it, when recovered.</P>
<P>Shall I tell thee my project? 'Tis not a high one. &mdash;'Tis this&mdash;To get hither Mrs. Moore, Mi&s;s Raw|lins, and my Widow Bevis; for they are de&s;irous to make a vi&s;it to my &s;pou&s;e, now we are &s;o happy together. And, if I can order it right, Belton, Mowb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, Tourville, and I, will &s;hew them a little more of the ways of this wicked town, than they at pre&s;ent know. Why &s;hould they be <HI>acquainted</HI> with a man of my character, and not be the <HI>better</HI> and <HI>wi&s;er</HI> for it?&mdash;I would have every-body rail again&s;t rakes with <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>knowlege,</HI> if they <HI>will</HI> rail. Two of the&s;e women gave me a great deal of trouble: And the third, I am confident, will forgive a merry evening.</P>
<P>I am really &s;ick at heart for a frolick, and have
<PB N="247" REF="248">
no doubt but this will be an agreeable one. The&s;e women already think me a wild fellow; <HI>nor do they like me the le&s;s for it,</HI> as I can perceive; and I &s;hall take care, that they &s;hall be treated with &s;o much freedom before one another's faces, that in policy they &s;hall keep each other's coun&s;el. And won't this be doing a kind thing by them? &s;ince it will knit an indi&s;&s;oluble band of union and friend&s;hip between three women who are neighbours, and at pre&s;ent have only <HI>common</HI> obligations to one another: For thou wante&s;t not to be told, that &s;ecrets of love, and &s;ecrets of this nature, are generally the &s;tronge&s;t cement of female friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>But, after all, if my Beloved &s;hould be happily re&s;tored to her intellects, we may have &s;cenes ari&s;e between us, that will be &s;ufficiently bu&s;y to employ all the faculties of thy friend, without looking out for new occa&s;ions. Already, as I have often ob|&s;erved, has &s;he been the means of &s;aving &s;cores; yet without her own knowlege.</P>

<P>I WENT out early this morning, and returned not till ju&s;t now; when I was informed, that my Beloved, in my ab&s;ence, had taken it into her head to attempt to get away.</P>
<P>She tripp'd down, with a parcel tied up in a hand|kerchief,

her hood on; and was actually in the entry, when Mrs. Sinclair &s;aw her.</P>

<P>She would have &s;poken; but could not: And, bur&s;ting into tears, turned back, and went up to her chamber: And Dorcas was taken to ta&s;k for &s;uffering her to be in the pa&s;&s;age before &s;he was &s;een.</P>
<P>This &s;hews, as we hoped la&s;t night, that &s;he is recovering her charming intellects.</P>

<P>I will endeavour to &s;ee her. It mu&s;t be in her own chamber, I &s;uppo&s;e; for &s;he will hardly meet me in the dining-room.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Night.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NEVER blame me for giving way to have Art u&s;ed with this admirable creature. All the princes of the air, or beneath it, joining with me, could never have &s;ubdued her while &s;he had her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I will not anticipate&mdash;Only to tell thee, that I am too much awaken'd by her to think of &s;leep, were I to go to bed; and &s;o &s;hall have nothing to do, but to write an account of our odd conver&s;ation, while it is &s;o &s;trong upon my mind that I can think of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;s'd in a white dama&s;k night-gown, with le&s;s negligence than for &s;ome days pa&s;t. I was &s;itting, with my pen in my fingers; and &s;tood up when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, with great complai&s;ance, as if the day were &s;till her own. And &s;o indeed it is.</P>
<P>She entered with &s;uch dignity in her manner, as &s;truck me with great awe, and prepared me for the poor figure I made in the &s;ub&s;equent conver&s;ation. A poor figure indeed!&mdash;But I will do her ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>She came up with quick &s;teps, pretty clo&s;e to me; a white handkerchief in her hand; her eyes neither fierce nor mild, but very earne&s;t; and a fix'd &s;edate|ne&s;s in her whole a&s;pect, which &s;eemed to be the effect of deep contemplation: And thus &s;he acco&s;ted me, with an air and action that I never &s;aw equal'd.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251">You &s;ee before you, Sir, the wretch, who&s;e pre|ference of you to all your Sex you have rewarded&mdash;as it indeed de&s;erved to be rewarded. My father's dreadful cur&s;e has already operated upon me in the very letter of it, as to This life; and it &s;eems to me too evident, that it will not be your fault, that it is not intirely completed in the lo&s;s of my &s;oul, as well as of my honour&mdash;Which you, villainous man! have robbed me of, with a ba&s;ene&s;s &s;o unna|tural, &s;o inhuman, that, it &s;eems, you, even <HI>you,</HI> had not the heart to attempt it, till my &s;en&s;es were made the previous &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Here I made an he&s;itating effort to &s;peak, laying down my pen&mdash;But &s;he proceeded: &mdash; Hear me out, guilty wretch!&mdash;abandon'd man!&mdash;<HI>Man</HI> did I &s;ay?&mdash; Yet what name el&s;e can I? &s;ince the mortal worry|ings of the fierce&s;t bea&s;t would have been more natural, and infinitely more welcome, than what you have acted by me; and that with a premedita|tion and contrivance worthy only of that &s;ingle heart, which now, <HI>ba&s;e</HI> as well as ingrateful as thou art, &s;eems to quake within thee.&mdash;And well may'&s;t thou quake; well may'&s;t thou tremble and falter; and he&s;itate, as thou do&s;t, when thou reflecte&s;t upon what I have &s;uffer'd for thy &s;ake, and the returns thou ha&s;t made me?</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, Belford, my whole frame was &s;haken: For not only her looks, and her action, but her voice, &s;o &s;olemn, was inexpre&s;&s;ibly affecting: And then my cur&s;ed guilt, and her innocence, and merit, and rank, and &s;uperiority of talents, all &s;tared me at that in&s;tant in the face &s;o formidably, that my pre|&s;ent account, to which &s;he unexpectedly called me, &s;eemed, as I then thought, to re&s;emble that general one, to which we are told we &s;hall be &s;ummoned, when our con&s;cience &s;hall be our accu&s;er.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="252">But &s;he had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence. The whole day probably in her in|tellects. And then I was the more di&s;appointed, as I had thought I could have gazed the dear creature into confu&s;ion&mdash;But it is plain, that the &s;en&s;e &s;he has of her wrongs &s;ets this matchle&s;s woman <HI>above all le&s;&s;er, all weaker</HI> con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>My dear&mdash;My love&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I never&mdash;No never&mdash; Lips trembling, limbs quaking, voice inward, he&s;i|tating, broken&mdash;Never &s;urely did mi&s;creant look &s;o <HI>like</HI> a mi&s;creant!

<P>I have no pride in the confu&s;ion vi&s;ible in thy whole per&s;on. I have been all the day praying for a compo&s;ure, if I could not e&s;cape from this vile hou&s;e, that &s;hould once more enable me to look up to my de&s;troyer with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of an innocent &s;ufferer.&mdash;Thou &s;ee&s;t me, &s;ince my wrongs are beyond the power of <HI>words to expre&s;s,</HI> thou &s;ee&s;t me, <HI>calm enough</HI> to wi&s;h, that thou may&s;t continue hara&s;&s;ed by the workings of thy own con&s;cience, till effectual repentance take hold of thee, that &s;o thou may&s;t not forfeit all title to <HI>that</HI> mercy, which thou ha&s;t not &s;hewn to the poor creature now before thee, who had &s;o well de&s;erved to meet with a faithful friend, where &s;he met with the wor&s;t of enemies.</P>
<P>But tell me (for no doubt thou ha&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;cheme to pur&s;ue), Tell me, &s;ince I am a pri&s;oner, as I find, in the vile&s;t of hou&s;es, and have not a friend to pro|tect or &s;ave me, what thou intende&s;t &s;hall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping? Tell me, if yet there are more evils re&s;erved for me; and whether thou ha&s;t enter'd into a compact with the grand deceiver, in the per&s;on of his horrid agent in this hou&s;e; and if the ruin of my &s;oul, that my father's cur&s;e may be fulfilled, is to complete the triumphs of &s;o vile a confederacy?&mdash;An&s;wer me!&mdash;
<PB N="252" REF="253">
Say, if thou ha&s;t courage to &s;peak out to her whom thou ha&s;t ruined, tell me, what <HI>further</HI> I am to &s;uffer from thy barbarity?</P>
<P>She &s;topp'd here; and, &s;ighing, turn'd her &s;weet face from me, drying up with her handkerchief tho&s;e tears which &s;he endeavour'd to re&s;train; and, when &s;he could not, to conceal from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>As I told thee, I had prepared my&s;elf for high pa&s;&s;ions, raving, flying, tearing, execration: The&s;e tran&s;ient violences, the workings of &s;udden grief, and &s;hame, and vengeance, would have &s;et us upon a par with each other, and quitted &s;cores. The&s;e have I been accu&s;tomed to; and, as nothing violent is la&s;ting, with the&s;e I could have wi&s;hed to encoun|ter. But &s;uch a maje&s;tic compo&s;ure&mdash;Seeking me&mdash; whom yet, it is plain by her attempt to get away, &s;he would have avoided &s;eeing &mdash; No Lucretia-like vengeance upon her&s;elf in her thought&mdash;Yet &s;wal|low'd up, her whole mind &s;wallow'd up, as I may &s;ay, by a grief &s;o heavy, as, in her own words, to be beyond the power of &s;peech to expre&s;s&mdash;and to be able, di&s;compo&s;ed as &s;he was to the very morning, to put &s;uch a home-que&s;tion to me, as if &s;he had pene|trated my future view&mdash;How could I avoid looking like a fool, and an&s;wering, as before, in broken &s;en|tences, and confu&s;ion?</P>

<P>She then called upon her cou&s;in Morden's name, as if he had warned her again&s;t a man of free prin|ciples; and walked towards the window; her hand|kerchief at her eyes: But, turning &s;hort towards me, with an air of mingled &s;corn and maje&s;ty&mdash;[<HI>What, at the moment, would I have given never to have in|jured her!</HI>] What amends ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> to propo&s;e!&mdash; What amends can &s;uch a one as Thou make to a per|&s;on of &s;pirit, or common &s;en&s;e, for the evils thou ha&s;t &s;o inhumanly made me &s;uffer?</P>

<P>So Dorcas will be a humane good &s;ort of creature, I believe, very quickly with her lady. And as it be|comes women to be &s;o, and as my Beloved is willing to think highly of her own &s;ex; it will the more readily pa&s;s with her.</P>
<P>I thought to have had one trial (having gone &s;o far) for <HI>cohabitation.</HI> But what hope can there be of &s;uc|ceeding?&mdash;She is invincible! &mdash; Again&s;t all my notions, again&s;t all my conceptions (thinking of her as a wo|man, and in the very bloom of her charms), &s;he is ab&s;olutely invincible! &mdash; My whole view, at the pre|&s;ent, is to do her legal ju&s;tice! if I can but once more get her out of her altitudes!</P>
<P>The <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of &s;uch a lady, mu&s;t make her ever new, ever charming. But, a&s;toni&s;hing! Can the want of a church ceremony make &s;uch a difference!</P>
<P>She <HI>owes</HI> me her con&s;ent; for hitherto I have had nothing to boa&s;t of. All, of my &s;ide, has been deep

<P>How her proud rejection &s;tings me!&mdash;And yet I hope &s;till to get her to li&s;ten to my &s;tories of the family-re|conciliation, and of her Uncle and Capt. Tomlin&s;on. &mdash;And as &s;he has given me a pretence to detain her, again&s;t her will, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee me, whether in tem|per, or not&mdash;She cannot help it. And if Love will not do, Terror, as the women advi&s;e, mu&s;t be tried.</P>
<P>A nice part, after all, has my Beloved to act. If &s;he forgive me ea&s;ily, I re&s;ume, perhaps, my projects: &mdash;If &s;he carry her rejection into violence, that vio|lence may make me de&s;perate, and occa&s;ion fre&s;h violence&mdash;She ought, &s;ince &s;he thinks &s;he has found the women out, to con&s;ider <HI>where &s;he is.</HI></P>
<P>I am confoundedly out of conceit with my&s;elf. If I give up my contrivances, my joy in &s;tratagem, and plot, and invention, I &s;hall be but a common man: Such another dull heavy creature as thy&s;elf.

<P>PITY me, Jack, for pity's &s;ake; &s;ince, if thou do&s;t not, no-body el&s;e will: And yet never was there a man of my genius, and lively temper, that wanted it more. We are apt to attribute to the devil every-thing that happens to us, which we would not <HI>have</HI> happen: But here, being (as perhaps thou'lt &s;ay) the devil, my&s;elf, my plagues ari&s;e from an angel. I &s;uppo&s;e all mankind is to be plagu'd by its <HI>contrary.</HI></P>
<P>She began with me like a true woman (<HI>She</HI> in the fault, <HI>I</HI> to be blamed) the moment I enter'd the dining-room: &mdash; Not the lea&s;t apology, not the lea&s;t excu&s;e, for the uproar &s;he had made, and the trouble &s;he had given me.</P>
<P>I come, &s;aid &s;he, into thy dete&s;ted pre&s;ence, be|cau&s;e I cannot help it. But why am I to be impri|&s;on'd here? &mdash; Altho' to no purpo&s;e, I cannot help&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam, interrupted I, give not way to &s;o much violence. You mu&s;t know, that your deten|tion is intirely owing to the de&s;ire I have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you. And This, as well for <HI>your</HI> &s;ake as <HI>my own.</HI>&mdash;Surely, there is &s;till <HI>one</HI> way left to repair the wrongs you have &s;uffer'd&mdash;</P>

<P>Surely, Madam, again interrupting her, If I may be permitted to call you <HI>legally</HI> mine, I might have but anticip&mdash;</P>
<P>Wretch, that thou art! Say not another word upon this &s;ubject. When thou vowed&s;t, when thou promi&s;ed&s;t at Ham&s;tead, I had begun to think, that I mu&s;t be thine. If I had con&s;ented, at the reque&s;t of tho&s;e I thought thy relations, this would have been a principal inducement, That I could then have brought thee, what was <HI>mo&s;t</HI> wanted, an un&s;ullied honour in dowry, to a wretch de&s;titute of all honour; and could have met the gratulations of a family, to which thy life has been one continued di&s;grace, with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>de&s;erving</HI> their gratulations. But thinke&s;t thou, that I will give a harlot-niece to thy honourable uncle, and to thy <HI>real</HI> aunts; and a cou&s;in to thy cou|&s;ins from a brothel? For &s;uch, in my opinion, is this dete&s;ted hou&s;e!&mdash;Then, lifting up her cla&s;ped hands,
<Q>Great and good God of Heaven, &s;aid &s;he, give me patience to &s;upport my&s;elf under the weight of tho&s;e afflictions, which Thou, for wi&s;e and good ends, tho' at pre&s;ent impenetrable by me, ha&s;t permitted!</Q></P>
<P>Then, turning towards me, who knew neither what to &s;ay <HI>to</HI> her, nor <HI>for</HI> my&s;elf, I renounce thee for ever, Lovelace!&mdash;Abhorred of my &s;oul! for ever I renounce thee! &mdash; Seek thy fortunes where&s;oever thou wilt! &mdash;Only now, that thou ha&s;t already ruin'd me&mdash;</P>
<P>Ruin'd you, Madam &mdash; The world need not &mdash; I knew not what to &s;ay&mdash;</P>

<P>Why he&s;itate you, Sir? What right have you to

&s;top me, as you lately did; and to bring me up by force, my hands and arms brui&s;ed with your violence? What right have you to detain me here?</P>
<P>I am cut to the heart, Madam, with invectives &s;o violent. I am but too &s;en&s;ible of the wrong I have done you, or I could not <HI>bear</HI> your reproaches. The man who perpetrates a villainy, and re&s;olves to go on with it, &s;hews not the compunction I &s;hew. Yet, if you think your&s;elf in my power, I would caution you, Madam, not to make me de&s;perate. For you <HI>&s;hall</HI> be mine, or my life &s;hall be the forfeit! Nor is life worth having without you!&mdash;</P>
<P>Be <HI>thine!</HI>&mdash;I be <HI>thine!</HI>&s;aid the pa&s;&s;ionate Beauty. O how lovely in her violence!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, Be <HI>mine!</HI> &mdash; I repeat, You <HI>&s;hall</HI> be mine! &mdash; My very crime is your glory. My love, my admiration of you is increa&s;ed by what has pa&s;&s;ed: <HI>And &s;o it ought.</HI> I am willing, Madam, to court your returning favour: But let me tell you, were the hou&s;e be&s;et by a thou&s;and armed men, re|&s;olved to take you from me, they &s;hould not effect their purpo&s;e, while I had life.</P>
<P>I never, never will be yours, &s;aid &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands together, and lifting up her eyes!&mdash;I never will be yours!</P>
<P>We may yet &s;ee many happy years, Madam. All your friends may be reconciled to you. The treaty for that purpo&s;e is in greater forwardne&s;s than you imagine. You know <HI>better</HI> than to think the <HI>wor&s;e</HI> of your&s;elf for &s;uffering what you <HI>could not help.</HI> In|join but the terms I can make my peace with you upon, and I will in&s;tantly comply.</P>
<P>Never, never, repeated &s;he, will I be yours!&mdash;</P>
<P>Only forgive me, my deare&s;t life, this <HI>one</HI> time!&mdash; A virtue &s;o invincible! what further view <HI>can</HI> I have again&s;t you?&mdash;Have I attempted any further outrage? &mdash;If you will be mine, your injuries will be injuries done to my&s;elf. You have too well gue&s;&s;ed at the

unnatural arts that have been u&s;ed? &mdash; But can a greater te&s;timony be given of your virtue?&mdash;And now I have only to hope, that altho' I cannot make you <HI>complete</HI> amends, yet that you will permit me to make you <HI>all</HI> the amends that can po&s;&s;ibly be made.</P>
<P>Hear me out, I be&s;eech you, Madam; for &s;he was going to &s;peak with an a&s;pect unpacifiedly angry: The God, whom you &s;erve, requires but repentance and amendment. Imitate <HI>Him,</HI> my deare&s;t love, and ble&s;s me with the <HI>means</HI> of reforming a cour&s;e of life, that begins to be hateful to me. <HI>That</HI> was <HI>once</HI> your favourite point. Re&s;ume it, deare&s;t crea|ture: In charity to a &s;oul as well as body, which once, as I flatter'd my&s;elf, was <HI>more</HI> than indifferent to you, re&s;ume it. And let to-morrow's &s;un wit|ne&s;s to our e&s;pou&s;als.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> cannot judge thee, &s;aid &s;he; but the GOD to whom thou &s;o boldly referre&s;t, can; and a&s;&s;ure thy|&s;elf <HI>He</HI> will. But, if compunction has <HI>really</HI> taken hold of thee; if <HI>indeed</HI> thou art touched for thy in|grateful ba&s;ene&s;s, and meane&s;t any thing by pleading the holy example thou recommende&s;t to my imita|tion; in this thy pretended repentant moment, let me &s;ift thee thoroughly; and, by thy an&s;wer, I &s;hall judge of the &s;incerity of thy pretended declarations.</P>
<P>Tell me then, Is there any reality in the treaty thou ha&s;t pretended to be on foot between my Uncle and Captain Tomlin&s;on, and thy&s;elf?&mdash;Say, and he&s;itate not, is there any truth in that &s;tory?&mdash;But, remember, if there be <HI>not,</HI> and thou avowe&s;t that there <HI>is,</HI> what further condemnation attends thy averrment, if it be as &s;olemn, as I require it to be!</P>
<P>This was a cur&s;ed thru&s;t. What could I &s;ay?&mdash; Surely, this mercile&s;s lady is re&s;olved to damn me, thought I, and yet accu&s;es me of a de&s;ign again&s;t her &s;oul!&mdash;But was I not obliged to proceed as I had begun?</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271">In &s;hort, I &s;olemnly averr'd, that there was!&mdash; How one crime, as the good folks &s;ay, brings on another?</P>
<P>I added, That the Captain had been in town, and would have waited on her, had &s;he not been indi&s;|po&s;ed: That he went down much afflicted, as well on her account, as on that of her uncle; tho' I had not acquainted him either with the nature of her di&s;order, or the ever-to-be-regretted occa&s;ion of it; having told him, that it was a violent fever: That he had twice &s;ince, by her uncle's de&s;ire, &s;ent up to inquire after her health: And that I had already di&s;patched a man and hor&s;e with a letter, to acquaint him (and her uncle thro' him) with her recovery; making it my earne&s;t reque&s;t, that he would re|new his application to her uncle for the favour of his pre&s;ence at the private celebration of our nuptials; and that I expected an an&s;wer, if not this night, as to-morrow.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k thee next, &s;aid &s;he, Thou knowe&s;t the opinion I have of the women thou broughte&s;t to me at Ham&s;tead; and who have &s;educed me hither to my ruin; Let me a&s;k thee, If <HI>really</HI> and <HI>truly,</HI> they were Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cou&s;in Montague?&mdash;What &s;aye&s;t thou&mdash;He&s;itate not&mdash;What &s;aye&s;t thou to this que&s;tion?</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hing, my dear, that you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect them!&mdash;But, knowing your &s;trange opinion of them, what can I &s;ay to be believed?</P>
<P>And is <HI>this</HI> the an&s;wer thou returne&s;t me? Do&s;t thou <HI>thus</HI> evade my que&s;tion? But let me know, for I am trying thy &s;incerity now, and &s;hall judge of thy new profe&s;&s;ions by thy an&s;wer to this que&s;tion; Let me know, I repeat, whether tho&s;e women be <HI>really</HI> Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cou&s;in Montague?</P>
<P>Let me, my deare&s;t love, be enabled to-morrow to call you lawfully mine, and we will &s;et out the next day, if you plea&s;e, to Berk&s;hire, to my Lord M.'s,

where they both are at this time, and you &s;hall con|vince your&s;elf by your own eyes, and by your own ears; which you will believe &s;ooner than all I can &s;ay or &s;wear.</P>
<P>Now, Belford, I had really &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of treachery from thee; which made me &s;o mi&s;e|rably evade; for el&s;e, I could <HI>as</HI> &s;afely have &s;worn to the truth of this, as to that of the former: But &s;he pre&s;&s;ing me &s;till for a categorical an&s;wer, I ven|tur'd plumb; and &s;wore to it [<HI>Lovers oaths, Jack</HI>] that they were really and truly Lady Betty Lawrance and my cou&s;in Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gue.</P>

But the effects of my ingrateful crime (&s;uch, with &s;hame and remor&s;e, I own it to be!) were the rea&s;on you could not &s;ee them.

<P>It &s;ignifies nothing now, that the cau&s;e of their appearance has been an&s;wer'd in my ruin, <HI>who</HI> or <HI>what</HI> they are: But, if thou ha&s;t averr'd thus &s;o|lemnly

<P>How determin'd is this lady!&mdash;Again had &s;he like to have e&s;caped us!&mdash;What a fixed re&s;entment!&mdash; She only, I find, a&s;&s;umed a little calm, in order to quiet &s;u&s;picion. She was got down, and actually had unbolted the &s;treet-door, before I could get to her; alarmed as I was by Mrs. Sinclair's cookmaid, who was the only one that &s;aw her fly thro' the pa&s;&s;age: Yet lightning was not quicker than I.</P>
<P>Again I brought her back to the dining-room, with infinite reluctance on her part. And before her face, ordered a &s;ervant to be placed con&s;tantly at the bottom of the &s;tairs for the future.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd even choak'd with grief and di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>Dorcas was exceedingly a&s;&s;iduous about her; and confidently gave it as her own opinion, that her dear lady &s;hould be permitted to go to another lodg|ing, &s;ince <HI>this</HI> was &s;o di&s;agreeable to her: Were &s;he
<PB N="276" REF="277">
to be killed for &s;aying &s;o, &s;he would &s;ay it. And was <HI>good</HI> Dorcas for this afterwards.</P>
<P>But for &s;ome time the dear creature was all pa&s;&s;ion and violence&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;ee, I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, when I had brought her up, what I am to expect from your new profe&s;&s;ions, O vile&s;t of men!&mdash;</P>
<P>Have I offered to you, my beloved creature, any thing that can ju&s;tify this impatience, after a more hopeful calm?</P>
<P>She wrung her hands. She di&s;order'd her head|dre&s;s. She tore her ruffles. She was in a perfect phren&s;y.</P>
<P>I dreaded her returning malady: But intreaty rather exa&s;perating, I affected an angry air&mdash;I bid her expect the wor&s;t &s;he had to fear&mdash;And was me|nacing on, in hopes to intimidate her, when, drop|ping down at my feet,</P>
<P>'Twill be a mercy, &s;aid &s;he, the highe&s;t act of mercy you can do, to kill me outright upon this &s;pot&mdash;This happy &s;pot, as I will, in my la&s;t mo|ments, call it!&mdash;Then, baring, with a &s;till more frantic violence, part of her inchanting neck&mdash;Here, here, &s;aid the &s;oul-harrowing beauty, let thy pointed mercy enter!

And ble&s;s thee for tho&s;e means!</P>
<P>Why all this extravagant pa&s;&s;ion, why all the&s;e exclamations? Have I offered any new injury to you, my deare&s;t life! What a phren&s;y is this! Am I not ready to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke you all the reparation that I <HI>can</HI> make you? Had I not rea&s;on to hope&mdash;</P>
<P>No, no, no, no&mdash;half a dozen times, as fa&s;t as &s;he could &s;peak.</P>
<P>Had I not rea&s;on to hope, that you were medi|tating upon the means of making me happy, and
<PB N="277" REF="278">
your&s;elf not mi&s;erable, rather than upon a flight &s;o cau&s;ele&s;s and &s;o precipitate?&mdash;</P>
<P>No, no, no, no, as before, &s;haking her head with wild impatience, as re&s;olved not to attend to what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>My re&s;olutions are &s;o honourable, if you will permit them to take effect, that I need not be &s;oli|citous whither you go, if you will but permit my vi&s;its, and receive my vows. And, God is my witne&s;s, that I bring you not back from the door with any view to your di&s;honour, but the contrary: And this moment I will &s;end for a mini&s;ter to put an end to all your doubts and fears.</P>
<P>Say this, and &s;ay a thou&s;and times more, and bind every word with a &s;olemn appeal to that God, whom thou art accu&s;tomed to invoke to the truth of the vile&s;t fal&s;hoods, and all will &s;till be &s;hort of what thou <HI>ha&s;t</HI> vowed and promi&s;ed to me. And, were <HI>not</HI> my heart to abhor thee, and to ri&s;e again&s;t thee, for thy <HI>perjuries,</HI> as it <HI>does,</HI> I would not, I tell thee once more, I would not, bind my &s;oul in covenant with &s;uch a man, for a thou&s;and worlds!</P>
<P>Compo&s;e your&s;elf, however, Madam; for <HI>your own &s;ake,</HI> compo&s;e your&s;elf. Permit me to rai&s;e you up; <HI>abhorred</HI> as I am of your &s;oul!&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, if I mu&s;t not touch you; for &s;he wildly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my hands; but with &s;uch a &s;weet pa&s;&s;ionate air, her bo&s;om heaving and throbbing as &s;he looked up to me, that altho' I was mo&s;t &s;incerely enraged, I could with tran&s;port have pre&s;s'd her to mine&mdash;</P>
<P>If I mu&s;t not touch you, I will not.&mdash;But depend upon it (and I a&s;&s;umed the &s;terne&s;t air I could a&s;&s;ume, to try what <HI>that</HI> would do), depend upon it, Ma|dam, that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread. Let me do what I will, I cannot be u&s;ed wor&s;e!&mdash;Dorcas, be gone!</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, Dorcas being about to withdraw, and wildly caught hold of her arm: O Dorcas! If thou
<PB N="278" REF="279">
art of mine own &s;ex, leave me not, I charge thee!&mdash; Then quitting Dorcas, down &s;he threw her&s;elf upon her knees, in the furthermo&s;t corner of the room, cla&s;ping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of it!&mdash;O where can I be &s;afe?&mdash;Where, where can I be &s;afe, from this man of violence?&mdash;</P>
<P>This gave Dorcas an opportunity to confirm her|&s;elf in her lady's confidence: The wench threw her&s;elf at my feet, while I &s;eemed in violent wrath; and, embracing my knees, Kill me, Sir, kill me, Sir, if you plea&s;e!&mdash;I mu&s;t throw my&s;elf in your way, to &s;ave my lady. I beg your pardon, Sir&mdash;But you mu&s;t be &s;et on!&mdash;God forgive the mi&s;chief-makers! &mdash;But your own heart, if left to it&s;elf, would not permit the&s;e things!&mdash;Spare, however, Sir! &s;pare my lady, I be&s;eech you! bu&s;tling on her knees about me, as if I were intending to approach her lady, had I not been re&s;trained by her.</P>
<P>This, humour'd by me, Begone, devil!&mdash;Offi|cious devil, begone!&mdash;&s;tartled the dear creature; who, &s;natching up ha&s;tily her head from the chair, and as ha&s;tily popping it down again in terror, hit her no&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, again&s;t the edge of the chair; and it gu&s;h'd out with blood, running in a &s;tream down her bo&s;om; &s;he her&s;elf too much affrighted to heed it!&mdash;</P>
<P>Never was mortal man in &s;uch terror and agitation as I; for I in&s;tantly concluded, that &s;he had &s;tabb'd her&s;elf with &s;ome concealed in&s;trument.</P>
<P>I ran to her in a wild agony&mdash;For Dorcas was frighted out of all her mock interpo&s;ition&mdash;</P>
<P>What have you done!&mdash;O what have you done! &mdash;Look up to me, my deare&s;t life!&mdash;Sweet injur'd innocence, look up to me! What have you done! &mdash;Long will I not &s;urvive you!&mdash;And I was upon the point of drawing my &s;word to di&s;patch my&s;elf, when I di&s;cover'd&mdash; [What an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her plea&s;ure!]

that all I apprehended was but a bloody no&s;e, which, as far as I know (for it could not be &s;topp'd in a quarter of an hour), may have &s;aved her head, and her intellects.</P>
<P>But I &s;ee by this &s;cene, that the &s;weet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom; and that I can ter|rify her out of her virulence again&s;t me, whenever I put on &s;ternne&s;s and anger: But then, as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her, I find my&s;elf to be a coward too, which I had not before &s;u|&s;pected, &s;ince I was capable of being &s;o ea&s;ily ter|rified by the apprehen&s;ions of her offering violence to her&s;elf.</P>

<P>BUT, with all this dear creature's re&s;entment again&s;t me, I cannot, for my heart, think but &s;he will get all over, and con&s;ent to enter the pale with me. Were &s;he even to die to-morrow, and to know &s;he &s;hould, would not a woman of her &s;en&s;e, of her punctilio, and in her &s;ituation, and of &s;o proud a family, rather die married, than otherwi&s;e? &mdash;No doubt but &s;he would; altho' &s;he were to hate the man ever &s;o heartily. If &s;o, there is now but one man in the world whom &s;he can have&mdash;And that is <HI>Me.</HI></P>
<P>Now I talk [<HI>familiar writing</HI> is but <HI>talking,</HI> Jack] thus glibly of entering the pale, thou wilt be ready to que&s;tion me, I know, as to my intentions on this head.</P>
<P>As much of my heart, as I know of it my&s;elf, will I tell thee.&mdash;When I am <HI>from</HI> her, I cannot &s;till help he&s;itating about marriage, and I even frequently re&s;olve again&s;t it; and am re&s;olved to pre&s;s my fa|vourite &s;cheme for cohabitation. But when I am <HI>with</HI> her, I am ready to &s;ay, to &s;wear, and to do,
<PB N="280" REF="281">
whatever I think will be mo&s;t acceptable to her: And were a par&s;on at hand, I &s;hould plunge at once, no doubt of it, into the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I have frequently thought, in <HI>common</HI> ca&s;es, that it is happy for many giddy fellows [There are giddy fellows, as well as giddy girls, Jack; and perhaps <HI>tho&s;e</HI> are as often drawn in, as <HI>the&s;e</HI>], that ceremony and parade are nece&s;&s;ary to the irrevocable &s;olemnity; and that there is generally time for a man to recol|lect him&s;elf in the &s;pace between the heated over-night, and the cooler next morning; or I know not who could e&s;cape the &s;weet gyp&s;ies, who&s;e fa&s;cinating powers are &s;o much aided by our own rai&s;ed imagi|nations.</P>
<P><HI>A wife at any time,</HI> I u&s;ed to &s;ay. I had ever confidence and vanity enough, to think, that no woman breathing could deny her hand, when I held out mine. I am confoundedly mortified to find, that this lady is able to hold me at bay, and to refu&s;e all my <HI>hone&s;t</HI> vows.</P>
<P>What force [allow me a &s;erious reflection, Jack&punc; It <HI>will</HI> be put down!] What force have evil habits upon the human mind! When we enter upon a devious cour&s;e, we think we &s;hall have it in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power, when we will, to return to the right path&punc; But it is not &s;o, I plainly &s;ee: For, who can ac|knowlege with more ju&s;tice this dear creature's me|rits, and his own errors, than I?

<P>At the pre&s;ent writing, however, the turn of the
<PB N="281" REF="282">
&s;cale is in favour of matrimony&mdash;For I de&s;pair of carrying with her my favourite point.</P>
<P>The lady tells Dorcas, that her heart is broken; and that &s;he &s;hall live but a little while. I think nothing of that, if we marry. In the fir&s;t place, &s;he knows not what a mind unapprehen&s;ive will do for her, in a &s;tate to which all the &s;ex look forward with high &s;atisfaction. How often have the whole &s;acred conclave been thus deceived in their choice of a pope; not con&s;idering, that the new dignity is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to give new life! &mdash; A few months heart's-ea&s;e will give my charmer a quite different notion of things: And I dare &s;ay, as I have hereto|fore &s;aid <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>203.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>, once married, and I am married for life.</P>
<P>I will allow, that her pride, in <HI>one</HI> &s;en&s;e, has &s;uf|fered aba&s;ement: But her triumph is the greater in every other. And while I can think, that all her trials are but additions to her honour, and that I have laid the foundations of her glory in my own &s;hame, can I be called cruel, if I am <HI>not</HI> affected with her grief, as &s;ome men would be?&mdash;</P>
<P>And for what &s;hould her heart be broken? Her will is unviolated:&mdash;At <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> however, her will is unviolated. The de&s;troying of good habits, and the introducing of bad, to the corrupting of the whole heart, is the violation. That her will is not to be corrupted, that her mind is not to be deba&s;ed, &s;he has hitherto unque&s;tionably proved. And if &s;he give cau&s;e for further trials, and hold fa&s;t her in|tegrity; what <HI>ideas</HI> will &s;he have to dwell upon, that will be able to corrupt her morals?&mdash;What <HI>ve&s;ti|gia,</HI> what <HI>remembrances,</HI> but &s;uch as will in&s;pire ab|horrence of the attempter?</P>
<P>What non&s;en&s;e then to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a mere notional violation, as &s;he has &s;uffered, &s;hould be able to cut a&s;under the &s;trings of life?</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="283">Her religion, married, or not married, will &s;et her above making &s;uch a trifling accident, &s;uch an <HI>involuntary</HI> &s;uffering, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tal to her.</P>
<P>Such con&s;iderations as the&s;e, they are, that &s;up|port me again&s;t all apprehen&s;ion of bugbear con&s;e|quences: And I would have them have weight with thee; who art &s;uch a doughty advocate for her.

And, if &s;he apprehend this her&s;elf, then has the dear over-nice &s;oul &s;ome rea&s;on for taking it &s;o much to heart: And yet would not, I think, refu&s;e to legitimate.</P>
<P>O Jack! had I an imperial diadem, I &s;wear to thee, that I would give it up, even to my <HI>enemy,</HI> to have one charming boy by this lady. And &s;hould &s;he <HI>e&s;cape me,</HI> and no &s;uch effect follow, my revenge on her family, and, in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a ca&s;e, on her&s;elf, would be incomplete, and I &s;hould reproach my&s;elf as long as I lived.</P>
<P>Were I to be &s;ure, that this foundation is laid [And why may I not hope it is?], I &s;hould not doubt to have her &s;till (&s;hould &s;he with&s;tand her day of grace) on my own conditions: Nor &s;hould I, if it were &s;o, que&s;tion that <HI>revived</HI> affection in <HI>her,</HI> which a woman &s;eldom fails to have for the father of her fir&s;t child, whether born in wedlock, or out of it.</P>

<P>VERY ill!&mdash;Exceeding ill!&mdash;as Dorcas tells me, in order to avoid &s;eeing me&mdash;And yet the dear &s;oul may be &s;o in her <HI>mind</HI>&mdash;But is not that equivo|cation?&mdash;Some one pa&s;&s;ion predominating, in every human brea&s;t, breaks thro' principle, and controuls us all. Mine is <HI>love</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> taking turns. Hers is <HI>hatred.</HI>&mdash;But this is my con&s;olation, that <HI>hatred appea&s;ed, is love begun</HI>; or <HI>love renew'd,</HI> I may rather &s;ay, if love ever had footing here.</P>
<P>But <HI>reflectioning</HI> apart, thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, that her plot is beginning to work. To-morrow it is to break out.</P>
<P>I have been abroad, to &s;et on foot a plot of cir|cumvention. All fair now, Belford!&mdash;</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;ted upon vi&s;iting my indi&s;po&s;ed fair one. Dorcas made officious excu&s;es for her. I cur&s;ed the wench in her hearing for her impertinence; and &s;tamp'd, and made a clutter;&mdash;which was improved into an apprehen&s;ion to the lady, that I would have flung her faithful confidante from the top of the &s;tairs to the bottom.</P>
<P>He is a violent wretch!&mdash;But, Dorcas (<HI>dear</HI> Dor|cas now it is), thou &s;halt have a friend in me to the la&s;t day of my life.</P>
<P>And what now do&s;t think, the name of her <HI>good angel</HI> is?&mdash;Why <HI>Dorcas Martindale,</HI> Chri&s;tian and &s;uper (no more Wykes) as in the promi&s;ory note in my former&mdash;And the dear creature has bound her to her by the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn</HI> obligations, <HI>be&s;ides</HI> the tie of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Whither, Madam, do you de&s;ign to go when you get out of this hou&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287">I will throw my&s;elf into the fir&s;t open hou&s;e I can find; and beg protection till I can get a coach, or a lodging in &s;ome hone&s;t family.</P>
<P>What will you do for cloaths, Madam?&mdash;I doubt you'll not be able to take any away with you, but what you'll have on.</P>
<P>O no matter for cloaths, if I can but get out of this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>What will you do for money, Madam? I have heard his Honour expre&s;s his concern, that he could not prevail upon you to be obliged to him, tho' he apprehended, that you mu&s;t be &s;hort of money.</P>
<P>O, I have rings, and other valuables. Indeed I have but four guineas, and two of them, I found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace, de&s;igned for a charitable u&s;e: But now, alas! Charity begins at home! But I have one dear friend left, if &s;he be living, as I hope in God &s;he is! to whom I can be obliged, if I want, O Dorcas! I mu&s;t ere now have heard from her, if I had had fair play.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, yours is a hard lot. I pity you at my heart!</P>
<P>Thank you, Dorcas! &mdash;I am unhappy, that I did not think <HI>before,</HI> that I might have confided in thy pity, and in thy &s;ex!</P>
<P>I pitied you, Madam, often and often: But you were always, as I thought, diffident of me. And then I doubted not but you were married; and I thought his Honour was unkindly u&s;ed by you. So that I thought it my duty to wi&s;h well to his Ho|nour, rather than to what I thought to be your humours, Madam. Would to heaven, that I had known before, that you were not married!&mdash;Such a lady! &mdash; Such a fortune! &mdash; To be &s;o &s;adly be|trayed!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, Dorcas! I was ba&s;ely drawn in! My youth! My ignorance of the world! &mdash; And I have &s;ome things to reproach my&s;elf with, when I look back!</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="288">Lord, Madam, what deceitful creatures are the&s;e men!&mdash;Neither oaths, nor vows!&mdash;I am &s;ure! I am &s;ure!&mdash;And then with her apron &s;he gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs&mdash;I may cur&s;e the time that I came into this hou&s;e! &mdash;</P>
<P>Here was accounting for her bold eyes! And was it not better to give up a hou&s;e, which her lady could not think wor&s;e of than &s;he did, in order to gain the reputation of &s;incerity, than by offering to vin|dicate it, to make her proffered &s;ervices &s;u&s;pected?</P>
<P>Poor Dorcas!&mdash;Ble&s;s me! how little do we, who have lived all our time in the country, know of this wicked town!&mdash;</P>
<P>Had I <HI>been able to write,</HI> cried the veteran wench, I &s;hould certainly have given &s;ome other near rela|tions I have in Wales, a little <HI>inkling</HI> of matters; and they would have &s;aved me from&mdash;from&mdash;from&mdash;</P>
<P>Her &s;obs were enough. The apprehen&s;ions of women on &s;uch &s;ubjects are ever aforehand with &s;peech.</P>
<P>And then, &s;obbing on, &s;he lifted her apron to her face again. She &s;hewed me how.</P>
<P>Poor Dorcas!&mdash;Again wiping her own charming eyes.</P>
<P>All love, all compa&s;&s;ion, is this dear creature to every one in affliction, but me.</P>
<P>And would not an aunt protect her kin&s;woman? &mdash;Abominable wretch!</P>
<P>I can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;&s;ay, my aunt was privy to it. She gave me good advice. She knew not for a great while, that I was&mdash;that I was&mdash;that I was&mdash; ugh!&mdash;ugh!&mdash;ugh!&mdash;</P>
<P>No more, no more, good Dorcas! &mdash; What a world we live in!&mdash;What a hou&s;e am I in! But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome, don't weep (tho' &s;he her&s;elf could not for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear): My being betrayed into it, tho' to my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, may be a happy event for thee: And, if I live, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">I thank you, my good lady, blubbering. I am &s;orry, very &s;orry, you have had &s;o hard a lot. But it may be the &s;aving of my &s;oul, if I can get to your lady&s;hip's hou&s;e.&mdash;Had I but known that your lady&s;hip was not married, I would have eat my own fle&s;h, before, before, before&mdash;</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;obb'd and wept. The lady &s;ighed and wept al&s;o.</P>
<P>But now, Jack, for a &s;erious reflection upon the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>How will the good folks account for it, that Satan has &s;uch faithful in&s;truments, and that the bond of wickedne&s;s is a &s;tronger bond, than the ties of virtue? &mdash;As if it were the nature of the hu|man mind to be villainous. For here, had Dorcas been <HI>good,</HI> and tempted, as &s;he was tempted, to any thing <HI>evil,</HI> I make no doubt, but &s;he would have yielded to the temptation.</P>
<P>And cannot our fraternity, in an hundred in&s;tances, give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue? And that we have ri&s;qued more to &s;erve and promote the intere&s;ts of the former, than ever a good man did to &s;erve a good man, or a good cau&s;e? For have we not been prodigal of life and fortune? Have we not defied the civil magi&s;trate upon occa&s;ion; and have we not attempted re&s;cues, and dared all things, only to extricate a pounded profligate?&mdash;</P>
<P>Whence, Jack, can this be?</P>
<P>O I have it, I believe. The vicious are as bad as they can be; and do the devil's work without looking after; while he is continually &s;preading &s;nares for the others; and, like a &s;kilful angler, &s;uit+ing his baits to the fi&s;h he angles for.</P>
<P>Nor let even <HI>hone&s;t</HI> people, <HI>&s;o called,</HI> blame po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cau&s;e. For does no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>General,</HI> who implicitly &s;erves an ambitious princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his unju&s;t de&s;igns upon his neighbours, or upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his own oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects; and even the <HI>Lawyer</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="290">
who, for the &s;ake of a paltry fee, undertakes to whi|ten a black cau&s;e, and to defend it again&s;t one he knows to be good, do the very &s;ame thing as Dorcas? And are they not both every whit as culpable? Yet the one &s;hall be dubbed a hero, the other a charm|ing fellow, and be contended for by every client; and his double-paced abilities &s;hall carry him thro' all the high preferments of the Law with reputation and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Well but, what &s;hall be done, &s;ince the lady is &s;o much determined on removing?&mdash;Is there no way to oblige her, and yet to make the very act &s;ub&s;ervient to my own views?&mdash;I fancy &s;uch a way may be found out.</P>
<P>I will &s;tudy for it&mdash;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I &s;uffer her to make an e&s;cape? Her heart is in it. If &s;he effect it, the triumph &s;he will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all &s;he has &s;uffered.</P>
<P>I will oblige her if I can.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>TIred with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fatiguing days and &s;leep|le&s;s nights, and with contemplating the preca|rious &s;ituation I &s;tand in with my Beloved, I fell into a profound re&s;verie; which brought on &s;leep; and that produced a dream; a fortunate dream; which, as I imagine, will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpo&s;e my heart is now once more &s;et upon.</P>
<P>What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoy|ment of the fine&s;t woman in the world, to the con|trivance, the bu&s;tle, the &s;urprizes, and at la&s;t the happy conclu&s;ion of a well-laid plot?&mdash;The charm|ing <HI>roundabouts,</HI> to come the <HI>neare&s;t way home</HI>;&mdash;
<PB N="290" REF="291">
the doubts; the apprehen&s;ions; the heart-akings, the meditated triumphs.&mdash;The&s;e are the joys that make the ble&s;&s;ing dear.&mdash;For all the re&s;t, what is it?&mdash; What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in fact?&mdash;But to my dream&mdash;</P>
<P>Methought it was about nine on Wedne&s;day morn|ing, that a chariot, with a dowager's arms upon the doors, and in it a grave matronly lady [not unlike Mother H. in the face; but in her heart O how un|like!], &s;topp'd at a grocer's &s;hop, about ten doors on the other &s;ide of the way, in order to buy &s;ome groceries: And methought Dorcas, having been out to &s;ee if the coa&s;t were clear for her lady's flight, and if a coach were to be got near the place, e&s;pied this chariot with the dowager's arms, and this matronly lady: And what, methought, did Dorcas, that &s;ub|tle traitre&s;s, do, but whip up to the old matronly lady, and, lifting up her voice, &s;ay, Good my Lady, permit me one word with your Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>What thou ha&s;t to &s;ay to me, &s;ay on, quoth the old lady; the grocer retiring, and &s;tanding aloof, to give Dorcas leave to &s;peak; who, methought, in words like the&s;e, acco&s;ted the lady.</P>
<P><Q>You &s;eem, Madam, to be a very good lady; and here in this neighbourhood, at a hou&s;e of no high repute, is an innocent lady of rank and for|tune, beautiful as a May morning, and youth|ful as a ro&s;e-bud, and full as &s;weet and lovely; who has been trick'd thither by a wicked gentle|man, practi&s;ed in the ways of the town; and this very night will &s;he be ruined, if &s;he get not out of his hands. Now, O Lady! if you will extend your compa&s;&s;ionate goodne&s;s to this fair young lady, in whom, the moment you behold her, you will &s;ee cau&s;e to believe all I &s;ay; and let her but have a place in your chariot, and remain in your pro|tection for one day only, till &s;he can &s;end a man
<PB N="291" REF="292">
and a hor&s;e to her rich and powerful friends; you may &s;ave from ruin a lady, who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty.</Q></P>
<P>Methought the old lady, moved with Dorcas's &s;tory, an&s;wered and &s;aid,
<Q>Ha&s;ten, O dam&s;el, who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to &s;erve the innocent and the virtuous, which it has always been my delight to do; Ha&s;ten to this young lady, and bid her hie hither to me with all &s;peed; and tell her, that my chariot &s;hall be her a&s;ylum: And if I find all that thou &s;aye&s;t true, my hou&s;e &s;hall be her &s;anctuary, and I will protect her from all her oppre&s;&s;ors.</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon, methought, this traitre&s;s Dorcas hied back to the lady, and made report of what &s;he had done. And, methought, the lady highly approved of Dorcas's proceeding, and ble&s;&s;ed her for her good thought.</P>
<P>And I lifted up mine eyes, and behold the lady i&s;&s;ued out of the hou&s;e, and without looking back, ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon it, and was received by the matronly lady with open arms, and
<Q>Welcome, welcome, welcome, fair young lady, who &s;o well an&s;wer the de&s;cription of the faithful dam&s;el: And I will carry you in&s;tantly to my hou&s;e, where you &s;hall meet with all the good u&s;age your heart can wi&s;h for, till you can appri&s;e your rich and powerful friends of your pa&s;t dangers, and pre&s;ent e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, worthy, thrice worthy lady, who afford &s;o kindly your protection to a mo&s;t unhappy young creature, who has been ba&s;ely &s;educed and betrayed, and brought to the very brink of de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>Methought then, the matronly lady, who had by the time the young lady came to her, bought and paid for the goods &s;he wanted, ordered her coach|man to drive home with all &s;peed; who &s;topped not
<PB N="292" REF="293">
till he had arrived in a certain &s;treet, not far from Lincolns-inn-fields, where the matronly lady lived in a &s;umptuous dwelling, replete with dam&s;els who wrought curiou&s;ly in mu&s;lins, cambricks, and fine linen, and in every good work that indu&s;trious dam|&s;els love to be imployed about, except the loom and the &s;pinning-wheel.</P>
<P>And methought, all the way the young lady and the old lady rode, and after they came in, till dinner was ready, the young lady filled up the time with the di&s;mal account of her wrongs and her &s;ufferings, the like of which was never heard by mortal ear; and this in &s;o moving a manner, that the good old lady did nothing but weep, and &s;igh, and &s;ob, and inveigh again&s;t the arts of wicked men, and again&s;t that abominable 'Squire Lovelace, who was a <HI>plotting vil|lain,</HI> methought &s;he &s;aid; and, more than that, an <HI>unchained Beelzebub.</HI></P>
<P>Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I found the lady had e&s;caped; and in my wrath had like to have &s;lain Dorcas, and our mother, and every one I met. But, by &s;ome quick tran&s;ition, and &s;trange metamorpho&s;is, which dreams do not u&s;ually account for, methought, all of a &s;udden, this matronly lady was turned into the famous Mother H. her&s;elf; and, being an old acquaintance of Mother Sinclair, was prevailed upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in my plot upon the young lady.</P>
<P>Then, methought, followed a &s;trange &s;cene; for, Mother H. longing to hear more of the young lady's &s;tory, and night being come, be&s;ought her to accept of a place in her own bed, in order to have all the talk to them&s;elves. For, methought, two young nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle of the di&s;mal tale.</P>
<P>Accordingly going early to bed, and the &s;ad &s;tory being re&s;umed, with as great earne&s;tne&s;s on one &s;ide, as attention on the other, before the young lady had
<PB N="293" REF="294">
gone far in it, Mother H. methought was taken with a fit of the colic; and her tortures increa&s;ing, was obliged to ri&s;e, to get a cordial &s;he u&s;ed to find &s;pe|cific in this di&s;order, to which &s;he was unhappily &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Having thus ri&s;en, and &s;tept to her clo&s;et, me|thought &s;he let fall the wax taper in her returns and then [O metamorpho&s;is &s;till &s;tranger than the former! What unaccountable things are dreams!], coming to bed again in the dark, the young lady, to her infinite a&s;toni&s;hment, grief, and &s;urprize, found Mother H. turned into a young per&s;on of the other &s;ex: And altho' Lovelace was the <HI>abhorred of her &s;oul,</HI> yet, fearing it was &s;ome <HI>other</HI> per&s;on, it was matter of &s;ome con&s;olation to her, when &s;he found it was no other than him&s;elf, and that &s;he had been &s;till the bedfellow of but one and the &s;ame man.</P>
<P>A &s;trange promi&s;cuous huddle of adventures fol|lowed; &s;cenes perpetually &s;hifting; now nothing heard from the lady, but &s;ighs, groans, exclamations, faintings, dyings.&mdash;From the gentleman, but vows, promi&s;es, prote&s;tations, di&s;claimers of purpo&s;es pur|&s;ued; and all the gentle and ungentle pre&s;&s;ures of the lover's warfare.</P>
<P>Then, as quick as thought [for dreams, thou knowe&s;t, confine not them&s;elves to the rules of the drama], en&s;ued recoveries, lyings-in, chri&s;tenings, the &s;miling boy, amply, even in <HI>her own</HI> opinion, rewarding the &s;uffering mother.</P>
<P>Then the grandfather's e&s;tate yielded up, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion taken of it&mdash;Living very happily upon it:&mdash; Her beloved Norton her companion; Mi&s;s Howe her vi&s;itor; and (admirable! thrice admirable I) en|abled to <HI>compare notes</HI> with her; a charming girl, by the &s;ame father, to her friend's charming boy; who, as they grow up, in order to con&s;olidate their mam|mas friend&s;hips [for neither have dreams regard to <HI>con&s;anguinity],</HI> intermarry; change names by act of
<PB N="294" REF="295">
parliament, to enjoy my e&s;tate;&mdash;and I know not what of the like incongruous &s;tuff.</P>
<P>I awoke, as thou maye&s;t believe, in great di&s;order, and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room, and Dorcas hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Now thou wilt &s;ay, this was a very odd dream. And yet (for I am a &s;trange dreamer) it is not alto|gether improbable, that &s;omething like it may hap|pen; as the pretty &s;impleton has the weakne&s;s to confide in Dorcas, whom, till now, &s;he di&s;liked.</P>
<P>But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; and that was, That, the next morning, the lady gave way to &s;uch tran&s;ports of grief and re&s;entment, that &s;he was with difficulty diverted from making an at|tempt upon her own life. But, however, at la&s;t, was prevailed upon to re&s;olve to live, and to make the be&s;t of the matter. A letter, methought, from Capt. Tomlin&s;on helping to pacify her, written to appri&s;e me, that her uncle Harlowe would certainly be at Kenti&s;h-town on Wedne&s;day night June 28. the following day, the 29th, being his anniver&s;ary birth-day; and he doubly de&s;irous, on that account, that our nuptials &s;hould be then privately &s;olemnized in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But <HI>is</HI> Thur&s;day the 29th her uncle's anniver&s;ary, methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t?&mdash;It is; or el&s;e the day of cele|bration &s;hould have been earlier &s;till. Three weeks ago I heard her &s;ay it was; and I have down the birth-day of every one of her family, and the wed|ding-day of her father and mother. The minute&s;t circum&s;tances are often of great &s;ervice, in matters of the la&s;t importance.</P>
<P>And what &s;aye&s;t thou now to my dream?</P>
<P>Who &s;ays, that, &s;leeping and waking, I have not fine helps from &s;ome <HI>body,</HI> &s;ome <HI>&s;pirit</HI> rather, as thou'lt be apt to &s;ay?&mdash;But no wonder that a Beel|zebub has his devilkins to attend his call.</P>
<P>I can have no manner of doubt of &s;ucceeding in
<PB N="295" REF="296">
Mother H.'s part of the &s;cheme; for will the lady (who re&s;olves to throw her&s;elf into the <HI>fir&s;t hou&s;e &s;he can enter,</HI> or to be&s;peak the protection of the <HI>fir&s;t per&s;on &s;he meets</HI>; and who thinks there can be no danger <HI>out</HI> of this hou&s;e, equal to what &s;he apprehends from Me <HI>in</HI> it) &s;cruple to accept of the chariot of a dowa|ger, accidentally offering? And the lady's protection engaged by her faithful Dorcas, &s;o highly bribed to promote her e&s;cape?&mdash;And then Mrs. H. has the air and appearance of a venerable matron, and is not &s;uch a forbidding devil as Mrs. Sinclair.</P>
<P>The pretty &s;impleton knows nothing of the world; nor that people who have money never want a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants in their views, be they what they will. How el&s;e could the princes of the earth be &s;o implicitly &s;erved as they are, change they hands ever &s;o often, and be their purpo&s;es ever &s;o wicked?</P>
<P>If I can but get her to <HI>go on</HI> with me till Wedne&s;|day next week, we &s;hall be &s;ettled together pretty quietly by that time. And indeed if &s;he has any gra|titude, and has in her the lea&s;t of her &s;ex's foibles, &s;he mu&s;t think I de&s;erve her favour, by the pains &s;he has co&s;t me. For dearly do they all love, that men &s;hould take pains about them, and for them.</P>
<P>And here, for the pre&s;ent, I will lay down my pen, and congratulate my&s;elf upon my happy inven|tion (&s;ince her ob&s;tinacy puts me once more upon ex|erci&s;ing it)&mdash;But with this re&s;olution, I think, That, if the pre&s;ent contrivance fail me, I will exert all the faculties of my mind, all my talents, to procure for my&s;elf a legal right to her favour, and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married &s;tate; and of the &s;ugge&s;tions of the great devil out of the hou&s;e, and of his &s;ecret agents in it.&mdash;Since, if <HI>now</HI> &s;he is not to be prevailed upon, or drawn in, it will be in vain to attempt her further.</P>

<P>NO admittance yet to my charmer! She is very ill &mdash; in a violent fever, Dorcas thinks. Yet will have no advice.</P>
<P>Dorcas tells her how much I am concerned at it.</P>
<P>But again let me a&s;k, Does this lady do right to make her&s;elf ill, when &s;he is <HI>not</HI> ill? For my own part, libertine as people think me, when I had <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> to be &s;ick, I took a do&s;e of ipecacuanha, that I might not be guilty of a fal&s;hood; and mo&s;t heartily &s;ick was I; as &s;he, who then pitied me, full well knew. But here to pretend to be very ill, only to get an op|portunity to run away, in order to avoid forgiving a man who has offended her, how unchri&s;tian! &mdash; If good folks allow them&s;elves in the&s;e breaches of a known duty, and in the&s;e pre&s;umptuous contrivances to deceive, who, Belford, &s;hall blame us?</P>
<P>I have a &s;trange notion, that the matronly lady will be certainly at the grocer's &s;hop at the hour of nine to-morrow morning: For Dorcas heard me tell Mrs. Sinclair, that I &s;hall go out at eight preci&s;ely; and then &s;he is to try for a coach: And if the dowager's chariot &s;hould happen to be there, how lucky will it be for my charmer! How &s;trangely will my dream be made out!</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received a letter from Captain Tom|lin&s;on. Is it not wonderful! For that was part of my dream!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, June</HI> 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Can now return you joy, for the joy you have given me, as well as my dear friend Mr. Harlowe, in the news of his beloved niece's happy recovery; for he is determined to comply with <HI>her</HI> wi&s;hes, and <HI>yours,</HI> and to give her to you with his own hand.</P>
<P>As the ceremony has been nece&s;&s;arily delayed by rea&s;on of her illne&s;s, and as Mr. Harlowe's Birth|day is on Thur&s;day the 29th of this in&s;tant June, when he enters into the &s;eventy-fourth year of his age; and as time may be wanted to complete the dear lady's recovery; he is very de&s;irous, that the marriage &s;hall be &s;olemnized upon it; that he may afterwards have double joy on that day, to the end of his life.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, he intends to &s;et out privately, &s;o as to be at Kenti&s;h-town on Wedne&s;day &s;e'nnight in the evening.</P>
<P>All the family u&s;ed, he &s;ays, to meet to celebrate it with him; but as they are at pre&s;ent in too un|happy a &s;ituation for that, he will give out, that, not being able to bear the day at home, he has re|&s;olved to be ab&s;ent for two or three days.</P>
<P>He will &s;et out on hor&s;eback, attended only with one tru&s;ty &s;ervant, for the greater privacy. He will
<PB N="298" REF="299">
be at the mo&s;t creditable-looking public hou&s;e there, expecting you both next morning, if he hear nothing from me to prevent him. And he will go to town with you after the ceremony is performed, in the coach he &s;uppo&s;es you will come in.</P>
<P>He is very de&s;irous, that I &s;hould be pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion. But this I have promi&s;ed him, at his reque&s;t, that I will be up before the day, in order to &s;ee the &s;ettlements executed, and every thing pro|perly prepared.</P>
<P>He is very glad that you have the licence ready.</P>
<P>He &s;peaks very kindly of you, Mr. Lovelace; and &s;ays, that, if any of the family &s;tand out after he has &s;een the ceremony performed, he will &s;eparate from them, and unite him&s;elf to his dear niece and her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>I owned to you, when in town, that I took &s;light notice to my dear friend of the mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween you and his niece; and that I did this, for fear the lady &s;hould have &s;hewn any little di&s;content in his pre&s;ence, were I to have been able to prevail upon him to go up in per&s;on, as then was doubtful. But I hope nothing of that di&s;content remains now.</P>
<P>My ab&s;ence, when your me&s;&s;enger came, mu&s;t excu&s;e me for not writing by him.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to make my mo&s;t re&s;pectful compli|ments acceptable to the admirable lady, and believe me to be</P>

<P>This letter I &s;ealed, and broke open. It was brought, thou may&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, by a particular me&s;|&s;enger; the &s;eal &s;uch a one as the writer need not be a&s;hamed of. I took care to inquire after the Cap|tain's health, in my Beloved's hearing; and it is now ready to be produced, as a pacifier, according as &s;he &s;hall <HI>take on,</HI> or <HI>re&s;ent,</HI> if the two metamorpho&s;es

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. Noon, June</HI> 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT &s;hall I &s;ay now!&mdash;I who but a few hours ago had &s;uch faith in dreams, and had propo&s;ed out of hand to begin my treati&s;e of <HI>Dreams-&s;leeping</HI> and <HI>Dreams-waking,</HI> and was plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the dialoguings between the old matronly lady, and the young lady; and with the two metamorpho&s;es (ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out); &s;hall never more depend upon tho&s;e flying follies, tho&s;e illu&s;ions of a fancy de|praved, and run mad.</P>
<P>Thus confoundedly have matters happened.</P>
<P>I went out at eight o'clock in high good humour with my&s;elf, in order to give the &s;ought-for oppor|tunity to the plotting mi&s;tre&s;s and corrupted maid; only ordering Will. to keep a good look-out, for fear his lady &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t my plot, or mi&s;take a hack|ney-coach for the dowager-lady's chariot. But fir&s;t I &s;ent to know how &s;he did; and received for an|wer, Very ill:&mdash;Had a very bad night: Which latter was but too probable: Since This <HI>I</HI> know, that peo|ple who have plots in their heads as &s;eldom <HI>have</HI> as <HI>de&s;erve</HI> good ones.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired a phy&s;ician might be called in; but was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I took a walk in St. James's park, congratulating my&s;elf all the way on my rare inventions: Then, im|patient, I took coach, with one of the windows <HI>quite</HI> up, the other <HI>almo&s;t</HI> up, playing at bo-peep at every
<PB N="300" REF="301">
chariot I &s;aw pa&s;s in my way to Lincolns-inn-fields: And, when arrived there, I &s;ent the coachman to de&s;ire any one of Mother H.'s family to come to me to the coach-&s;ide, not doubting but I &s;hould have intelligence of my fair fugitive there; it being then half an hour after ten.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant came to me, who gave me to under|&s;tand, that the matronly lady was ju&s;t returned by her&s;elf in the chariot.</P>
<P>Frighted out of my wits, I alighted, and heard from the Mother's own mouth, that Dorcas had in|gaged her to protect the lady; but came to tell her afterwards, that &s;he had changed her mind, and would not quit the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Quite a&s;toni&s;h'd, not knowing what might have happen'd, I order'd the coachman to la&s;h away to our mother's.</P>
<P>Arriving here in an in&s;tant, the fir&s;t word I a&s;k'd, was, If the lady were &s;afe <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Lovelace gives here a very circum&s;tantial relation of all that pa&s;&s;ed between the Lady and Dorcas. But as he could only gue&s;s at her motives for refu&s;ing to go off, when Dorcas told her, that &s;he had en|gaged for her the protection of the dowager lady, it is thought proper to omit his relation, and to &s;upply it by &s;ome <HI>memoranda</HI> of the Lady's. But it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to account for the occa&s;ion on which tho&s;e <HI>me|moranda</HI> were made.</P>
<P>The reader may remember, that in the letter wrote to Mi&s;s Howe on her e&s;cape to Ham&s;tead <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>352.</HI></NOTE>, &s;he promi&s;es to give her the particulars of her flight at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>She had indeed thoughts of continuing her account of every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Mr. Lovelace, &s;ince her la&s;t narrative letter. But the uncertainty &s;he was in from that time, with the execrable treatment &s;he met with on her being deluded back again; followed by a week's delirium; had hitherto hindered her from pro&s;ecuting her in|tention. But, neverthele&s;s, having it &s;till in her view to perform her promi&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he had opportunity, &s;he made minutes of every thing as it pa&s;&s;ed, in order to help her memory:&mdash;Which, as &s;he ob|&s;erves, in one place, &s;he could le&s;s tru&s;t to &s;ince her late di&s;orders than before.</P>
<P>In the&s;e minutes, or book of <HI>memoranda,</HI> &s;he ob&s;erves,
<Q>That having apprehen&s;ions, that Dorcas might be a traitre&s;s, &s;he would have got away while &s;he was gone out to &s;ee for a coach; and actually &s;lid down &s;tairs with that intent. But that, &s;eeing Mrs. Sinclair in the entry</Q>
[whom Dorcas had planted there while &s;he went out),
<Q>&s;he &s;peeded up again, un&s;een.</Q></P>
<P>She then went up to the dining-room, and &s;aw the letter of Captain Tomlin&s;on: On which &s;he ob&s;erves in her memorandum-book, as follows.</P>
<Q><P>How am I puzzled now!&mdash;He might leave this letter on purpo&s;e: None of the other papers left with it being of any con&s;equence: &mdash; What's the alternative?&mdash;To &s;tay, and be the wife of the vile&s;t of men&mdash;How my heart re&s;i&s;ts that!&mdash;To attempt to get off, and fail, ruin inevitable! &mdash; Dorcas <HI>may</HI> betray me! &mdash; I doubt &s;he is <HI>&s;till</HI> his implement!&mdash;At his going out, he whi&s;per'd her, as I &s;aw, unob|&s;erved&mdash;In a very familiar manner too&mdash;Never fear, Sir, with a courte&s;y.</P>
<P>In her agreeing to connive at my e&s;cape, &s;he provided not for her own &s;afety, if I got away! Yet had rea&s;on, in that ca&s;e, to expect his vengeance; and wants not forethought.&mdash;To have taken her <HI>with me,</HI> was to be in the power of her intelligence, if a faithle&s;s creature.&mdash;Let me, however, tho' I part not with my caution, keep my charity!&mdash;Can there be any woman &s;o vile to woman?&mdash;O yes! &mdash; Mrs. Sinclair: Her aunt.&mdash;The Lord deliver me!&mdash;But, alas! I have put my&s;elf out of the cour&s;e of his protection by the <HI>natural</HI> means&mdash;And am already ruin'd!&mdash;A father's cur&s;e likewi&s;e again&s;t me!&mdash;Having made vain all my friends cautions and &s;olicitudes, I mu&s;t not hope for miracles in my favour!</P>
<P>If I do e&s;cape, what may become of me, a poor, helple&s;s, de&s;erted creature!&mdash;Helple&s;s from &s;ex!&mdash;From circum&s;tances!&mdash;Expo&s;ed to every danger!&mdash;Lord protect me!</P>
<P>His vile man not gone with him!&mdash;Lurking hereabouts, no doubt, "to watch my &s;teps!&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> not go away by the chariot, however.</P><P>That this chariot &s;hould come &s;o opportunely!&mdash;So like his many <HI>opportunelies!</HI> &mdash; That Dorcas &s;hould have the &s;udden thought! &mdash; Should have the <HI>courage</HI> with the thought, to addre&s;s a lady in be|half of an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to that lady! &mdash; That the lady &s;hould &s;o readily con&s;ent!&mdash;Yet the tran&s;action between them to take up &s;o much time; their di&s;tance in degree con&s;ider'd: For, arduous as the ca&s;e was, and precious as the time, Dorcas was gone above half an hour! Yet the chariot was &s;aid to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off!</P>
<P>Indeed &s;ome elderly ladies are talkative: And there are, no doubt, <HI>&s;ome</HI> good people in the world&mdash;</P>
<P>But that it &s;hould chance to be a widow lady, who could do what &s;he plea&s;ed: That Dorcas &s;hould know her to be &s;o, by the Lozenge! Per&s;ons in her &s;tation not u&s;ually &s;o knowing, I believe, in heraldry.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ome may!&mdash;For &s;ervants are fond of deriving <HI>collateral</HI> ho|nours and di&s;tinctions, as I may call them, from the quality, or people of rank, whom they &s;erve.</P>
<P>But his &s;ly &s;ervant not gone with him!&mdash;Then this letter of Tom|lin&s;ons!&mdash;</P>
<P>Altho' I am re&s;olved never to have this wretch, yet, may I not <HI>throw my&s;elf into my uncle's protection at Kenti&s;h-Town or Highgate, if I cannot e&s;cape before; and &s;o get clear of him?</HI>&mdash;May not the evil I know, be le&s;s than what I may fall into, if I can avoid further vil|lainy? &mdash; Further villainy he has not yet threatened &mdash; freely and ju&s;tly as I have treated him! &mdash; I will not go, I think. At lea&s;t, unle&s;s I can &s;end this fellow out of the way <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">She tried to do this; but was prevented by the fellow's pretending to put his ancle out, by a &s;lip down &s;tairs&mdash;<HI>"A trick,"</HI> &s;ays his con|triving ma&s;ter, in his omitted relation,
<Q>"I had learned him, on a like occa&s;ion, at Amiens.</Q>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fellow a villain! The wench, I doubt, a vile wench. At la&s;t concerned for her own &s;afety. Plays off and on about a coach.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day afternoon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DI&s;appointed in her meditated e&s;cape;&mdash;obliged, again&s;t her will, to meet me in the dining-room; &mdash;and perhaps apprehen&s;ive of being upbraided for her art in feigning her&s;elf ill; I <HI>expected</HI> that the dear perver&s;e would <HI>begin</HI> with me with &s;pirit and indig|nation. But I was in hopes, from the gentlene&s;s of her natural di&s;po&s;ition, from the con&s;ideration which I expected from her, on her &s;ituation on the letter of Captain Tomlin&s;on, which Dorcas told me &s;he had &s;een, and from the time &s;he had had to cool and reflect, &s;ince &s;he la&s;t admitted me to her pre&s;ence, that &s;he would not have carried it &s;o &s;trongly thro', as &s;he did.</P>
<P>As I enter'd the dining-room, I congratulated her and my&s;elf upon her <HI>&s;udden</HI> recovery. And would have taken her hand, with an air of re&s;pectful ten|derne&s;s. But &s;he was re&s;olved to begin where &s;he left off.</P>
<P>She turned from me, drawing in her hand, with a repul&s;ing and indignant a&s;pect&mdash;I meet you once more, &s;aid &s;he, becau&s;e I cannot help it. What
<PB N="303" REF="304">
have you to &s;ay to me? Why am I to be thus de|tained again&s;t my will?</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity of &s;peech and behaviour, I urged the ceremony. I &s;aw I had nothing el&s;e for it.&mdash;I had a letter in my pocket, I &s;aid (feeling for it, altho' I had not taken it from the table where I left it, and which we were then near), the contents of which, if attended to, would make us both happy. I had been loth to &s;hew it to her before, becau&s;e I hoped to prevail upon her to be mine &s;ooner than the day mentioned in it.</P>
<P>I felt for it in all my pockets, watching her eye mean time, which I &s;aw glance towards the table where it lay.</P>
<P>I was unea&s;y that I could not find it&mdash;At la&s;t, di|rected again by her &s;ly eye, I &s;pied it on the table at the further end of the room.</P>
<P>With joy I fetch'd it. Be plea&s;ed to read that letter, Madam, with an air of &s;atisfied a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>She took it, and ca&s;t her eye over it, in &s;uch a carele&s;s way, as made it evident, that &s;he had read it before: And then unthankfully to&s;s'd it into the window-&s;eat before her.</P>
<P>I urged her to ble&s;s me to-morrow, or Friday morn|ing: At lea&s;t, that &s;he would not render vain her uncle's journey, and kind endeavours to bring about a reconciliation among us all.</P>
<P><HI>Among us all,</HI> repeated &s;he, with an air equally di&s;|dainful and incredulous. O Lovelace, thou art &s;urely nearly allied to the grand deceiver, in thy endeavour to &s;uit temptations to inclinations!&mdash;But what honour, what faith, what veracity, were it po&s;&s;ible that I could enter into parley with thee on this &s;ubject, which it is not, may I expect from &s;uch a man as thou ha&s;t &s;hewn thy&s;elf to be?</P>
<P>I was touch'd to the quick. A lady of your per|fect character, Madam, who has feign'd her&s;elf &s;ick, on purpo&s;e to avoid &s;eeing the man who adored her, &s;hould&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="305">I know what thou would&s;t &s;ay, interrupted &s;he!&mdash; Twenty and twenty low things, that my &s;oul would have been above being guilty of, and which I have de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf for, have I been brought into by the infection of thy company, and by the nece&s;&s;ity thou ha&s;t laid me under, of appearing mean. But I thank God, de&s;titute as I am, that I am not, however, &s;unk &s;o low, as to wi&s;h to be thine.</P>
<P>I, Madam, as the injurer, <HI>ought</HI> to have patience. It is for the injured to reproach. But your uncle is not in a plot again&s;t you, it is to be hoped. There are circum&s;tances in the letter you have ca&s;t your eyes over&mdash;</P>
<P>Again &s;he interrupted me, Why, once more I a&s;k thee, am I detained in this hou&s;e? &mdash; Do I not &s;ee my&s;elf &s;urrounded by wretches, who, tho' they wear the habit of my &s;ex, may yet, as far as I know, lie in wait for my perdition?</P>
<P>She would be very loth, I &s;aid, that Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces &s;hould be called up to vindicate them|&s;elves, and their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Would but they kill me, let them come, and wel|come. I will ble&s;s the hand that will &s;trike the blow; indeed I will.</P>
<P>'Tis idle, very idle, to talk of dying. Mere young-lady talk, when controuled by tho&s;e they hate.&mdash;But let me be&s;eech you, deare&s;t creature&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;eech me nothing. Let me not be detained thus again&s;t my will!&mdash;Unhappy creature, that I am, &s;aid &s;he, in a kind of phren&s;y, wringing her hands at the &s;ame time, and turning from me, her eyes lifted up! Thy cur&s;e, O my cruel father, &s;eems to be now in the height of its operation!&mdash;I am in the way of being a lo&s;t creature as to both worlds! Ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed God, &s;aid &s;he, falling on her knees, &s;ave me, O &s;ave me from my&s;elf, and from this man!</P>
<P>I &s;unk down on my knees by her, exce&s;&s;ively af|fected.&mdash;O that I could recall ye&s;terday! &mdash;Forgive

<P>O no, no, no! lifting up her cla&s;ped hands, I never, never <HI>will,</HI> never, never <HI>can</HI> forgive you!&mdash; And it is a puni&s;hment wor&s;e than death to me, that I am obliged to meet you, or to &s;ee you!</P>
<P>This is the la&s;t time, my deare&s;t life, that you will ever &s;ee me in this po&s;ture, on this occa&s;ion: And again I kneeled to her.&mdash;Let me hope, that you will be mine next Thur&s;day, your uncle's birth-day, if not before. Would to Heaven I had never been a villain! Your indignation is not, cannot be, greater than my remor&s;e&mdash;and I took hold of her gown; for &s;he was going from me.</P>
<P>Be remor&s;e thy portion!&mdash;For thy own &s;ake, be remor&s;e thy portion! &mdash; I never, never will forgive thee!&mdash;I never, never will be thine!&mdash;Let me retire! &mdash;Why kneele&s;t thou to the wretch whom thou ha&s;t &s;o vilely humbled?</P>

<P>LET me peri&s;h, if I know what to make either of my&s;elf, or of this &s;urpri&s;ing creature &mdash; Now calm, now tempe&s;tuous &mdash; But I know thou love&s;t not anticipation any more than me.</P>
<P>At my repeated reque&s;ts, &s;he met me at &s;ix this morning. She was ready dre&s;&s;ed; for &s;he has not had her cloaths off ever &s;ince &s;he declared, that they never more &s;hould be off in this hou&s;e. And charm|ingly &s;he looked, with all the di&s;advantages of a three hours violent &s;tomach-ach (for Dorcas told me, that &s;he had been really ill), no re&s;t, and eyes red, and &s;well'd with weeping. Strange to me, that tho&s;e charming fountains have not been long ago exhau&s;ted. But &s;he is a woman. And I believe anatomi&s;ts allow, <HI>that women have more watry heads than men.</HI></P>
<P>Well, my deare&s;t creature, I hope you have now thoroughly con&s;ider'd of the contents of Captain Tom|lin&s;on's letter. But as we are thus early met, let me be&s;eech you to make this my happy day.</P>
<P>She looked not favourably upon me. A cloud hung upon her brow at her entrance: But as &s;he was going
<PB N="311" REF="312">
to an&s;wer me, a &s;till greater &s;olemnity took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her charming features.</P>
<P>Your air, and your countenance, my beloved creature, are not propitious to me. Let me beg of you, before you &s;peak, to forbear all further recri|minations. For already I have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of my vilene&s;s to you, that I know not how to bear the re|proaches of my own mind.</P>
<P>I have been endeavouring, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ince I am not permitted to avoid you, after a compo&s;ure which I never more expected to &s;ee you in. How long I may enjoy it, I cannot tell. But I hope I &s;hall be enabled to &s;peak to you without that vehemence which I expre&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday, and could not help it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Lady, in her minutes, &s;ays, "I fear Dorcas is a fal&s;e one. May I not be able to prevail upon him to leave me at my liberty? Better to try, than to tru&s;t to her. If I cannot prevail, but mu&s;t meet him and my uncle, I hope I &s;hall have fortitude enough to re|nounce him then. But I would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch, or to give him an expectation which I intend not to an&s;wer. If I am mi&s;tre&s;s of my own re&s;olutions, my uncle him&s;elf &s;hall not prevail with me to bind my &s;oul in covenant with &s;o vile a man."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e (for I was all attention) thus &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P>It ea&s;y for me, Mr. Lovelace, to &s;ee, that further violences are intended me, if I comply not with your purpo&s;es, whatever they are. I will &s;uppo&s;e them to be what you &s;o &s;olemnly profe&s;s they are. But I have told you as &s;olemnly my mind, that I never <HI>will,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat I never <HI>can,</HI> be yours; nor, if &s;o, any man's upon earth. All vengeance, neverthele&s;s, for the wrongs you have done me, I di&s;claim. I want but to &s;lide into &s;ome ob&s;cure corner, to hide my&s;elf from you, and from every one, who once loved me. The de|&s;ire lately &s;o near my heart, of a reconciliation with my friends, is much abated. They &s;hall not receive me <HI>now,</HI> if they <HI>would.</HI> Sunk in my own eyes, I now think my&s;elf unworthy of their favour. In the angui&s;h of my &s;oul, therefore, I conjure you, Love|lace (tears in her eyes), to leave me to my fate. In
<PB N="312" REF="313">
doing &s;o, you will give me a plea&s;ure, the highe&s;t I now can know.</P>
<P>Whither, my deare&s;t life&mdash;</P>
<P>No matter whither. I will leave to Providence, when I am out of this hou&s;e, the direction of my fu|ture &s;teps. I am &s;en&s;ible enough of my de&s;titute condition. I know, that I have not now a friend in the world. Even Mi&s;s Howe has given me up&mdash;or you are&mdash;But I would fain keep my temper! &mdash; By your means I have lo&s;t them all&mdash;And you have been a barbarous enemy to me. You know you have.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>I could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>The evils I have &s;uffered, proceeded &s;he (turning from me), however irreparable, are but <HI>temporary</HI> evils &mdash;Leave me to my hopes of being enabled to obtain the Divine forgivene&s;s, for the offence I have been drawn in to give to my parents, and to virtue; that &s;o I may avoid the evils that are <HI>more than temporary.</HI> This is in now all I have to wi&s;h for. And what is it that I demand, that I have not a right to, and from which it is an illegal violence to with-hold me?</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me, I told her plainly, to comply. I be&s;ought her to give me her hand as this very day. I could not live without her. I commu|nicated to her my Lord's illne&s;s, as a rea&s;on why I wi&s;h'd not to &s;tay for her uncle's anniver&s;ary. I be|&s;ought her to ble&s;s me with her con&s;ent; and, after the ceremony was pa&s;&s;ed, to accompany me down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Berks. And thus, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid I, will yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be freed from a hou&s;e, to which you have conceive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o great an antipathy.</P>
<P>This, thou wilt own, was a princely offer. And I was re&s;olved to be as good as my word. I though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had kill'd my Con&s;cience, as I told thee, Belford &s;ome time ago. But Con&s;cience, I find, tho' it ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be temporarily &s;tifled, cannot die; and when it da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not &s;peak aloud, will whi&s;per. And at this in&s;tant
<PB N="313" REF="314">
I thought I felt the revived varlete&s;s (on but a &s;light retrograde motion), writhing round my pericardium like a &s;erpent; and, in the action of a dying one (collecting all its force into its head), fix its plaguy fangs into my heart.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated, and looked down, as if irre&s;olute. And this &s;et my heart up at my mouth. And, believe me, I had in&s;tantly popt in upon me, in imagination, an old &s;pectacled par&s;on, with a white &s;urplice thrown over a black habit (A fit emblem of the halcyon of|fice, which, under a benign appearance, often intro|duces a life of &s;torms and tempe&s;ts), whining and &s;nuf|fling thro' his no&s;e the irrevocable ceremony.</P>
<P>I hope now, my dear life, &s;aid I, &s;natching her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to my lips, that your &s;ilence bodes me good. Let me, my beloved creature, have but your tacit con&s;ent this moment, to &s;tep out, and engage a mini&s;ter&mdash;And then I promi&s;ed how much my whole future life &s;hould be devoted to her com|mands, and that I would make her the be&s;t and ten|dere&s;t of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, turning to me, I have told you my mind, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he. Think you, that I could thus &s;olemnly&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt&mdash;I am too much in your power, proceeded &s;he; Your pri&s;oner, rather than a per&s;on free to choo&s;e for my&s;elf, or to &s;ay what I will <HI>do</HI> or <HI>be.</HI>&mdash;But, as a te&s;timony that you mean me well, let me in&s;tantly quit this hou&s;e; and I will then give you &s;uch an an&s;wer in writing, as be&s;t be|fits my unhappy circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>And imagine&s;t thou, faire&s;t, thought I, that this will go down with a Lovelace? Thou oughte&s;t to have known, that free-livers, like mini&s;ters of &s;tate, never part with a power put into their hands, without an equivalent of twice the value.</P>
<P>I pleaded, that if we joined hands <HI>this morning</HI> (if not, <HI>to-morrow</HI>; if not, on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> her uncle's birth-day, and in his pre&s;ence); and afterwards, as I

had propo&s;ed, &s;et out for Berks; we &s;hould, of cour&s;e, quit this hou&s;e; and, on our return to town, &s;hould have in readine&s;s the hou&s;e I was in treaty for.</P>
<P>She an&s;wer'd me not, but with tears and &s;ighs: <HI>Fond of believing what I hoped,</HI> I imputed her &s;ilence to the mode&s;ty of her &s;ex. The dear creature, thought I, &s;olemnly as &s;he began with me, is ruminating, in a &s;weet &s;u&s;pen&s;e, how to put into fit words the gentle purpo&s;es of her conde&s;cending heart. But, looking in her averted face with a &s;oothing gentlene&s;s, I plainly perceived, that it was re&s;entment, and not ba&s;hful|ne&s;s, that was &s;truggling in her bo&s;om <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Lady, in her minutes, owns the difficulty &s;he lay under to keep her temper in this conference.

<P>Will not the con&s;equence of your departure hence be, that I &s;hall lo&s;e you for ever, Madam?&mdash;And can I bear the thoughts of that?</P>
<P>She flung from me&mdash;My &s;oul di&s;dains to hold parley with thee, were her violent words&mdash;But I threw my|&s;elf at her feet, and took hold of her reluctant hand, and began to imprecate, to vow, to promi&s;e&mdash;But thus the pa&s;&s;ionate Beauty, interrupting me, went on:</P>

<P>But Dorcas &s;oon rou&s;ed me &mdash; Do you know, Sir, I running in ha&s;tily, that my lady is gone down &s;tairs!</P>
<P>No, &s;ure!&mdash;And down I flew, and found her once more at the &s;treet-door, contending with Polly Hor|ton to get out.</P>
<P>She ru&s;hed by me into the fore-parlour, and flew to the window, and attempted once more to throw up the &s;a&s;h&mdash;Good people! Good people! cried &s;he.</P>
<P>I caught her in my arms, and lifted her from the window.

<P>She was vi&s;ibly affrighted: And up &s;tairs &s;he ha&s;ten'd. A bad woman is certainly, Jack, more terrible to her own &s;ex, than even a bad man.</P>
<P>I follow'd her up. She ru&s;hed by her own apart|ment into the dining-room: No terror can make her forget her punctilio.</P>
<P>To recite what pa&s;&s;ed there of invective, exclama|tions, threatenings, even of her own life, on one &s;ide; of expo&s;tulations, &s;upplications, and &s;ometimes me|naces, on the other, would be too affecting; and, after my particularity in like &s;cenes, the&s;e things may as well be imagined as expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I will therefore only mention, that, at length, I extorted a conce&s;&s;ion from her. She had rea&s;on <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Lady mentions, in her memorandum-book, that &s;he had no other way, as &s;he apprehended, to &s;ave her&s;elf from in&s;tant di&s;ho|nour, but by making this conce&s;&s;ion. Her only hope, now, &s;he &s;ays if &s;he cannot e&s;cape by Dorcas's connivance (whom, neverthele&s;s, &s;he &s;u&s;pects), is, to find a way to engage the protection of her uncle, and even of the civil magi&s;trate, on Thur&s;day next, if nece&s;&s;ary.
<Q>He &s;hall &s;ee, &s;he &s;ays, tame and timid as he has thought her, what &s;he dare to do, to avoid &s;o hated a compul&s;ion; and a man capable of a ba&s;ene&s;s &s;o premeditatedly vile and inhuman.</Q></NOTE> to think it would have been wor&s;e for her on the &s;pot, if &s;he had not made it. It was, <HI>That &s;he would en|deavour to make her&s;elf ea&s;y, till &s;he &s;aw what next Thur&s;day, her uncle's birth-day, would produce.</HI> But O that it were not a &s;in, &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed, on making this poor conce&s;&s;ion, to put an end to her own life, rather than yield to give me but <HI>that</HI> a&s;|&s;urance!</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="318">This, however, &s;hews me, that &s;he is aware, that the reluctantly-given a&s;&s;urance may be fairly con|&s;trued into a matrimonial expectation on my &s;ide. And if &s;he will <HI>now,</HI> even <HI>now,</HI> look forward, I think, from my heart, that I will put on her livery, and wear it for life.</P>
<P>What a &s;ituation am I in, with all my cur&s;ed in|ventions? I am puzzled, confounded, and a&s;hamed of my&s;elf, upon the whole. To take &s;uch pains to be a villain!&mdash; But (for the <HI>fiftieth</HI> time) let me a&s;k thee, Who would have thought, that there had been &s;uch a woman in the world?&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, &s;he had be&s;t take care, that &s;he carries not her ob&s;tinacy much further. She knows not what revenge for &s;lighted love will make me do.</P>
<P>The bu&s;y &s;cenes I have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed thro', have given emotions to my heart, which will not be quieted one while. My heart, I &s;ee (on reperu&s;ing what I have written), has communicated its tremors to my fingers; and in &s;ome places the characters are &s;o indi&s;tinct and unformed, that thou'lt hardly be able to make them out. But if one <HI>half</HI> of them only are intelli|gible, that will be enough to expo&s;e me to thy con|tempt, for the wretched hand I have made of my plots and contrivances.&mdash;But &s;urely, Jack, I have gained &s;ome ground by this promi&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, one word to the a&s;&s;urances thou &s;ende&s;t me, that thou ha&s;t not betrayed my &s;ecrets in rela|tion to this charming creature. Thou mighte&s;t have &s;pared them, Belford. My &s;u&s;picions held no longer than while I wrote about them <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>258.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>. For well I knew, when I allowed my&s;elf time to think, that thou had&s;t no <HI>principles,</HI> no <HI>virtue,</HI> to be mi&s;led by. A great deal of &s;trong envy, and a little of weak pity, I knew to be thy motives. Thou could&s;t not provoke my anger, and my compa&s;&s;ion thou ever had&s;t; and art
<PB N="318" REF="319">
now more e&s;pecially intitled to it; beau&s;e thou art a <HI>pityful</HI> fellow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day night,</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>COnfoundedly out of humour with this perver&s;e lady. Nor wilt thou blame me, if thou art my friend. She regards the conce&s;&s;ion &s;he made, as a conce&s;&s;ion extorted from her: And we are but ju&s;t where we were before &s;he made it.</P>
<P>With great difficulty I prevailed upon her to favour me with her company for one half-hour this evening. The nece&s;&s;ity I was under to go down to M. Hall, was the &s;ubject I wanted to talk to her upon.</P>
<P>I told her, that as &s;he had been &s;o good as to pro|mi&s;e, that &s;he would endeavour to make her&s;elf ea&s;y till &s;he &s;aw the Thur&s;day in next week over,&mdash;I hoped, that &s;he would not &s;cruple to oblige me with her word, that I &s;hould find her here, at my return from M. Hall.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he would make me no &s;uch promi&s;e. No|thing of <HI>this hou&s;e</HI> was mentioned to me, &s;aid &s;he: You know it was not. And do you think that I would have given <HI>my con&s;ent to my impri&s;onment in it?</HI></P>
<P>I was plaguily nettled, and di&s;appointed too. If I go not down to M. Hall, Madam, you'll have no &s;cruple to &s;tay here, I &s;uppo&s;e, till Thur&s;day is over?</P>
<P>If I cannot help my&s;elf, I mu&s;t.&mdash;But I in&s;i&s;t upon being permitted to go out of this hou&s;e, whether you leave it, or not.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, then I will comply with your commands. And I will go out this very evening, in que&s;t of lodgings that you &s;hall have no objection to.</P>
<P>I will have no lodgings of your providing, Sir&mdash;I will go to Mrs. Moore's at Ham&s;tead.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320">Mrs. Moore's, Madam?&mdash;I have no objection to Mrs. Moore's.&mdash;But will you give me your promi&s;e, to admit me there to your pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>As I do here&mdash;When I cannot help it.</P>
<P>Very well, Madam&mdash;Will you be &s;o good, as to let me know, what you intended by your promi&s;e to <HI>make your&s;elf ea&s;y</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>To <HI>endeavour,</HI> Sir, to make my&s;elf ea&s;y&mdash;were the words&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;Till you &s;aw what next Thur&s;day would produce?</HI></P>
<P>A&s;k me no que&s;tions that may in&s;nare me. I am too &s;incere for the company I am in.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, Madam, What meant you, when you &s;aid,
<Q>that, were it not a &s;in, you would die before you gave me that a&s;&s;urance?</Q></P>
<P>She was indignantly &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You thought, Madam, you had given me room to hope your pardon by it?</P>
<P>When I think I ought to an&s;wer you with patience, I will &s;peak.</P>
<P>Do you think your&s;elf in my power, Madam?</P>
<P>If I were not&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t creature, &s;peak out&mdash;I be&s;eech you, deare&s;t creature, &s;peak out.&mdash;</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent; her charming face all in a glow.</P>
<P>Have you, Madam, any reliance upon my honour?</P>
<P>Still &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You hate me, Madam. You de&s;pi&s;e me more than you do the mo&s;t odious of God's creatures.</P>
<P>You ought to de&s;pi&s;e me, if I did not.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Madam, you are in a <HI>bad</HI> hou&s;e. You have <HI>no reliance</HI> upon my honour&mdash;You believe you <HI>cannot avoid me</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>She aro&s;e. I be&s;eech you, let me withdraw.</P>
<P>I &s;natch'd her hand, ri&s;ing, and pre&s;s'd it fir&s;t to my lips, and then to my heart, in wild di&s;order. She might have felt the bounding mi&s;chief ready to bur&s;t its bars&mdash;You <HI>&s;hall</HI> go&mdash;To your own apartment, if
<PB N="320" REF="321">
you plea&s;e&mdash;But, by the great God of Heaven, I will accompany you thither.</P>
<P>She trembled&mdash;Pray, pray, Mr. Lovelace, don't terrify me &s;o!</P>
<P>Be &s;eated, Madam! I be&s;eech you be &s;eated!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will &s;it down&mdash;</P>
<P>Do then, Madam&mdash;Do then&mdash;All my &s;oul in my eyes, and my heart's blood throbbing at my fingers ends.</P>
<P>I will&mdash;I will&mdash;You hurt me&mdash;Pray, Mr. Love|lace, don't&mdash;don't frighten me &s;o&mdash;And down &s;he &s;at, trembling; my hand &s;till gra&s;ping hers.</P>
<P>I hung over her throbbing bo&s;om, and putting my other arm round her wai&s;t&mdash;And you &s;ay, you hate me, Madam &mdash; And you &s;ay, you de&s;pi&s;e me!&mdash;And you &s;ay, you promi&s;ed me nothing&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, I did promi&s;e you&mdash;Let me not be held down thus&mdash;You &s;ee I &s;at down when you bid me&mdash; Why (&s;truggling) need you hold me down thus?&mdash; I did promi&s;e <HI>to endeavour to be ea&s;y till Thur&s;day was over!</HI> But you won't let me! &mdash; How can I be ea&s;y?&mdash; Pray, let me not be thus terrified.</P>
<P>And what, Madam, meant you by your promi&s;e? Did you mean any-thing in my favour?&mdash; You de|&s;igned, that I &s;hould, at the time, <HI>think</HI> you did. Did you mean any thing in my favour, Madam?&mdash; Did you intend, that I &s;hould <HI>think</HI> you did?</P>
<P>Let go my hand, Sir&mdash;Take away your arm from about me, &s;truggling, yet trembling &mdash; <HI>Why do you gaze upon me &s;o?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer me, Madam&mdash;Did you mean any thing in my favour by your promi&s;e?</P>
<P>Let me not be thus con&s;trained to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Then pau&s;ing, and gaining more &s;pirit, Let me go, &s;aid &s;he: I am but a woman&mdash;but a weak woman&mdash; But my life is in my own power, tho' my per&s;on is not&mdash;I will not be thus con&s;trained.</P>
<P>You &s;hall not, Madam, quitting her hand, bow|ing,
<PB N="321" REF="322">
but my heart at my mouth, and hoping farther provocation.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and was hurrying away.</P>
<P>I pur&s;ue you not, Madam&mdash;I will try your gene|ro&s;ity&mdash;Stop&mdash;Return.&mdash;This moment &s;top, return, if, Madam, you would not make me de&s;perate.</P>
<P>She &s;topt at the door; bur&s;t into tears&mdash; O Love|lace!&mdash;How, how, have I de&s;erved&mdash;</P>
<P>Be <HI>plea&s;ed,</HI> deare&s;t angel, to return.</P>
<P>She came back&mdash;But with declared reluctance; and imputing her compliance to terror.</P>
<P>Terror, Jack, as I have heretofore found out, tho' I have &s;o little benefited by the di&s;covery, mu&s;t be my re&s;ort, if &s;he make it nece&s;&s;ary &mdash; Nothing el&s;e will do with the inflexible charmer.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf over-again&s;t me; extremely di&s;|compo&s;ed.&mdash;But indignation had a vi&s;ible predomi|nance in her features.</P>
<P>I was going towards her, with a countenance in|tendedly changed to love and &s;oftne&s;s: Sweete&s;t, deare&s;t angel, were my words, in the tendere&s;t ac|cent:&mdash;But, ri&s;ing up, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon my being &s;eated at di&s;tance from her.</P>
<P>I obeyed&mdash;and begged her hand over the table, to my extended hand; to &s;ee, as I &s;aid, if in any thing &s;he would oblige me &mdash; But nothing gentle, &s;oft, or affectionate would do. She refu&s;ed me her hand!&mdash; Was &s;he wi&s;e, Jack, to confirm to me, that nothing but terror would do?</P>
<P>Let me only know, Madam, if your promi&s;e to <HI>endeavour</HI> to wait with patience the event of next Thur&s;day, meant me favour?</P>
<P>Do you expect any voluntary favour from one to whom you give not a free choice?</P>
<P>Do you intend, Madam, to honour me with your hand, in your uncle's pre&s;ence, or do you not?</P>
<P>My heart and my hand &s;hall never be &s;eparated.
<PB N="322" REF="323">
Why, think you, did I &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to the will of my be&s;t my natural friends?</P>
<P>I know what you mean, Madam&mdash;Am I then as hateful to you as the vile Solmes?</P>
<P>A&s;k me not &s;uch a que&s;tion, Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be an&s;wered. Am I as hateful to you, as the vile Solmes?</P>
<P>Why do you call Mr. Solmes vile?</P>
<P>Don't <HI>you</HI> think him &s;o, Madam?</P>
<P>Why &s;hould I? Did Mr. Solmes ever do vilely by me?</P>
<P>Deare&s;t creature! don't di&s;tract me by hateful compari&s;ons! And perhaps by a more hateful prefer|ence.</P>
<P>Don't you, Sir, put que&s;tions to me, that you know I will an&s;wer truly, tho' my an&s;wer were ever &s;o much to enrage you.</P>
<P>My heart, Madam, my &s;oul is all yours at pre|&s;ent. But you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> give me hope, that your promi&s;e, in your own con&s;truction, binds you, no <HI>new cau&s;e</HI> to the contrary, to be mine on Thur&s;day. How el&s;e can I leave you?</P>
<P>Let me go to Ham&s;tead; and tru&s;t to my favour.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> I tru&s;t to it?&mdash;Say, only, <HI>May</HI> I tru&s;t to it?</P>
<P>How will you tru&s;t to it, if you extort an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Say only, deare&s;t creature, &s;ay only, <HI>may</HI> I tru&s;t to your favour, if you go to Ham&s;tead?</P>
<P>How <HI>dare</HI> you, Sir, if I mu&s;t &s;peak out, expect a promi&s;e of favour from me?&mdash;What a mean crea|ture mu&s;t you think me, after your ingrateful ba&s;e|ne&s;s to me, were I to give you &s;uch a promi&s;e?</P>
<P>Then &s;tanding up, Thou ha&s;t made me, O vile&s;t of men! (her hands cla&s;ped, and a face crim&s;oned over with indignation) an inmate of the vile&s;t of hou&s;es&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, while I am in it, I &s;hall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of <HI>that</HI> and of <HI>thee!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324">And round her looked the angel, and upon me, with fear in her &s;weet a&s;pect of the con&s;equence of her free declaration.&mdash;But what a devil mu&s;t I have been, I, who love bravery in a man, had I not been more &s;truck with admiration of her fortitude at the in&s;tant, than &s;timulated by revenge?</P>
<P>Noble&s;t of creatures! &mdash; And do you think I can leave you, and my intere&s;t in &s;uch an excellence, precarious? No promi&s;e!&mdash;No hope!&mdash;If you make me not de&s;perate, may lightning bla&s;t me, if I do you not all the ju&s;tice 'tis in my power to do you!</P>
<P>If you have any intention to oblige me, leave me at my own liberty, and let me not be detained in this abominable hou&s;e. To be con&s;trained as I have been con&s;trained! To be &s;topt by your vile agents! To be brought up by force, and to be brui&s;ed, in my own defence again&s;t &s;uch illegal violence!&mdash;I dare to die, Lovelace&mdash;And the per&s;on that fears not death is not to be intimidated into a meanne&s;s un|worthy of her heart and principles!</P>
<P>Wonderful creature! But why, Madam, did you lead me to hope for &s;omething favourable for next Thur&s;day?&mdash;Once more, make me not de&s;perate&mdash; With all your magnanimity, glorious creature! [I was more than half frantic, Belford] You <HI>may,</HI> you <HI>may</HI> &mdash; But do not, do not make me brutally threaten you!&mdash;Do not, do not make me de&s;perate!</P>
<P>My a&s;pect, I believe, threatened &s;till more than my words. I was ri&s;ing&mdash;She aro&s;e&mdash;Mr. Lovelace, be pacified&mdash;You are even more dreadful than the Lovelace I have long dreaded&mdash;Let me retire&mdash;I a&s;k your <HI>leave</HI> to retire&mdash;You really frighten me&mdash;Yet I give you no hope&mdash;From my heart I ab&mdash;</P>
<P>Say not, Madam, you <HI>abhor</HI> me &mdash; You mu&s;t, for your own &s;ake, conceal your hatred &mdash; At lea&s;t not avow it.&mdash;I &s;eized her hand.</P>
<P>Let me retire &mdash; Let me retire, &s;aid &s;he &mdash;in a man|ner out of breath.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="325">I will only &s;ay, Madam, that I refer my&s;elf to your genero&s;ity. My heart is not to be tru&s;ted at this in&s;tant.

<P>Away flew the charmer, with this half-permi&s;|&s;ion&mdash;And no doubt thought, that &s;he had an e&s;cape-nor without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I knew not for half an hour what to do with my|&s;elf. Vexed at the heart, neverthele&s;s, now &s;he was from me, when I reflected upon her hatred of me, and her defiances, that I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be &s;o over-awed, checked, re&s;trained&mdash;</P>
<P>And now I have written thus far (having of cour&s;e recollected the whole of our conver&s;ation), I am more and more incen&s;ed again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I will go down to the&s;e women&mdash;and perhaps &s;uffer my&s;elf to be laugh'd at by them.</P>
<P>Devil fetch them, they pretend to know their own &s;ex.

<PB N="325" REF="326">
and hypocri&s;y of the whole &s;ex; and wi&s;h for nothing &s;o ardently, as that I will leave the per|ver&s;e lady to their management, while I am gone to Berk&s;hire; undertaking ab&s;olutely for her humility and pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s on my return; and continually boa&s;t|ing of the many perver&s;e creatures whom they have obliged to draw in their traces.</P>
<P>They often upbraidingly tell me, that they are &s;ure I &s;hall marry at la&s;t:&mdash;And Sally, the la&s;t time I was with her, had the confidence to hint, that, when a wife, &s;ome other per&s;on would not find half the difficulty, that I had found.&mdash;Confidence, indeed! But yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, That this dear creature is the only woman in the world, of whom I &s;hould not be jealous. And yet, if a man gives him&s;elf up to the company of the&s;e devils, they never let him re&s;t, till he either &s;u&s;pect or hate his wife.</P>
<P>But a word or two of other matters, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Methinks, I long to know how cau&s;es go at M. Hall. I have another private intimation, that the old Peer is in the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go down. Yet what to do with this lady the mean while!&mdash;The&s;e cur&s;ed women are full of cruelty and enterpri&s;e. She will never be ea&s;y with them in my ab&s;ence. They will have provocation and pretence therefore. But woe be to them, if&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet what will vengeance do, after an in&s;ult com|mitted? The two nymphs will have jealous rage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o goad them on&mdash;And what will with-hold a jealous and already-ruined woman?</P>
<P>To let her go el&s;ewhere; that cannot he done. I am &s;till re&s;olved to be hone&s;t, if &s;he'll give me hope: If yet &s;he'll <HI>let me</HI> be hone&s;t &mdash; But I'll &s;ee how &s;he'll be, after the contention &s;he will certainly have be|tween her re&s;entment, and the terror &s;he had rea&s;on for, from our la&s;t conver&s;ation.&mdash;So let this &s;ubject re&s;t till the morning. And to the old Peer once more.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="327">I &s;hall have a good deal of trouble, I reckon, tho' no &s;ordid man, to be decent on the expected occa|&s;ion. Then how to act (I who am no hypocrite) in the days of condolement!

<P>Thou, Belford, knowe&s;t a good deal of this &s;ort of grimace; and can&s;t help a gay heart to a little of the di&s;mal. But then every feature of thy face is cut out for it. My heart may be touched, perhaps, &s;ooner than thine; for, believe me, or not, I have a very tender one:&mdash;But then, no man looking in my face, be the occa&s;ion for grief ever &s;o great, will believe <HI>that</HI> heart to be deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All is placid, ea&s;y, &s;erene, in my countenance. Sorrow cannot &s;it half an hour together upon it. Nay, I believe, that Lord M.'s recovery, &s;hould it happen, would not affect me above a quarter of an hour. Only the new &s;cenery (and the plea&s;ure of aping an Heraclitus to the family, while I am a Democritus among my private friends), or I want nothing that the old Peer can leave me. Wherefore then &s;hould grief &s;adden and di&s;tort &s;uch blythe, &s;uch jocund features as mine?</P>
<P>But as for thine, were there murder committed in the &s;treet, and thou wert but pa&s;&s;ing by, the mur|derer even in &s;ight, the pur&s;uers would quit <HI>him,</HI> and lay hold of <HI>thee:</HI> And thy very looks would hang, as well as apprehend, thee.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 23. <HI>Friday morning.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went out early this morning, on a de&s;ign that I know not yet whether I &s;hall or &s;hall not pur&s;ue; and on my return found Simon Par&s;ons, my Lord's Berk&s;hire Bailiff (ju&s;t before arrived), waiting for me with a me&s;&s;age in form, &s;ent by all the family, to pre&s;s me to go down, and that at my Lord's particu|lar de&s;ire; who wants to &s;ee me before he dies.</P>
<P>Simon has brought my Lord's chariot-and-&s;ix (per|haps <HI>my own</HI> by this time), to carry me down. I have ordered it to be in readine&s;s by four to-morrow morning. The cattle &s;hall &s;moke for the delay; and by the re&s;t they'll have in the interim, will be better able to bear it.</P>
<P>I am &s;till re&s;olved upon matrimony, if my fair Perver&s;e will accept of me. But, if &s;he will not&mdash; why then I mu&s;t give an uninterrupted hearing, not to my con&s;cience, but to the&s;e women below.</P>
<P>Dorcas had acquainted her lady with Simon's ar|rival and errand. My Beloved had de&s;ired to &s;ee him. But my coming in prevented his attendance on her, ju&s;t as Dorcas was in&s;tructing him what que&s;tions he &s;hould not an&s;wer to, that might be a&s;ked of him.</P>
<P>I am to be admitted to her pre&s;ence immediately, at my repeated reque&s;t&mdash;Surely the acqui&s;ition in view will help me to make all up with her&mdash;She is ju&s;t gone up to the dining-room.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>NOTHING will do, Jack! &mdash; I can procure no fa|vour from her, tho' &s;he has obtained from me the point which &s;he had &s;et her heart upon.</P>
<P>I will give thee a brief account of what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t propo&s;ed in&s;tant marriage; and this in the mo&s;t fervent manner: But was denied as fervently.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="329">Would &s;he be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he would &s;tay here only till Tue&s;day morning? I would but ju&s;t go down, and &s;ee how my Lord was&mdash;To know whether he had any thing particular to &s;ay, or injoin me, while yet he was &s;en&s;ible, as he was very ear|ne&s;t to &s;ee me&mdash;Perhaps I might be up on Sunday&mdash; Concede in &s;omething! &mdash; I be&s;eech you, Madam, &s;hew me &s;ome little con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Why, Mr. Lovelace, mu&s;t I be determined by your motions?&mdash;Think you, that I will voluntarily give a &s;anction to the impri&s;onment of my per&s;on? Of what importance to me ought to be your &s;tay or your return?</P>
<P><HI>Give a &s;anction to the impri&s;onment of your per&s;on!</HI> Do you think, Madam, that I fear the Law?&mdash;</P>
<P>I might have &s;pared this fooli&s;h que&s;tion of defi|ance&mdash;But my pride would not let me. I thought &s;he threatened me, Jack.</P>
<P>I <HI>don't</HI> think &s;o, Sir &mdash; You are too <HI>brave</HI> to have any regard either to moral or divine &s;anctions.</P>
<P>'Tis well, Madam! &mdash; But a&s;k me any thing I can do to oblige <HI>you</HI>; and I <HI>will</HI> oblige you, tho' in no|thing will you oblige <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>Then I a&s;k you, then I reque&s;t of you, to let me go to Ham&s;tead.</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed &mdash; and at la&s;t &mdash; By my &s;oul you &s;hall&mdash; This very moment I will wait upon you, and &s;ee you fixed there, if you'll promi&s;e me your hand on Thur&s;day, in pre&s;ence of your uncle.</P>
<P>I want not <HI>you</HI> to &s;ee me fixed&mdash;I will promi&s;e nothing.</P>
<P>Take care, Madam, that you don't let me &s;ee, that I can have no reliance upon your future favour.</P>
<P>I have been u&s;ed to be threatened by you, Sir&mdash; But I will accept of your company to Ham&s;tead&mdash; I will be ready to go in a quarter of an hour&mdash;My cloaths may be &s;ent after me.</P>
<P>You know the condition, Madam&mdash;Next Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>You dare not tru&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="330">My infinite demerits tell me, that I <HI>ought</HI> not&mdash; Neverthele&s;s I <HI>will</HI> confide in your genero&s;ity&mdash;To-morrow morning (no <HI>new cau&s;e</HI> ari&s;ing to give rea&s;on to the contrary), as early as you plea&s;e, you may go to Ham&s;tead.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed to oblige her. But yet &s;he looked with a face of doubt.</P>
<P>I will go down to the women. And having no better judges at hand, will hear what they &s;ay upon my critical &s;ituation with this proud beauty, who has &s;o in&s;olently rejected a Lovelace kneeling at her feet, tho' making an earne&s;t tender of him&s;elf for a hu&s;band, in &s;pite of all his prejudices to the &s;tate of &s;hackles.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>JUST come from the women.</P>
<P><Q>Have I gone &s;o far, and am I afraid to go farther?&mdash;Have I not already, as it is evident by her behaviour, &s;inned beyond forgivene&s;s?&mdash;A wo|man's tears u&s;ed to be to me but as water &s;prinkled on a glowing fire, which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze: What defence has this lady, but her tears and her eloquence? She was before taken at <HI>no weak</HI> advantage. She was <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> in her mo|ments of trial. <HI>Had</HI> &s;he been &s;en&s;ible, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have been &s;en&s;ible. So they &s;ay. The methods taken with her have augmented her glory and her pride. She has now a tale to tell, that &s;he <HI>may</HI> tell, with honour to her&s;elf. No accomplice-inclination. She can look me into confu&s;ion, without being con&s;cious of &s;o much as a <HI>thought,</HI> which &s;he need to be a&s;hamed of.</Q></P>
<P>This, Jack, the &s;ub&s;tance of my conference with the women.</P>
<P>To which let me add, that the dear creature now &s;ees the nece&s;&s;ity I am in to leave her. Detecting me
<PB N="330" REF="331">
is in her head. My contrivances are of &s;uch a na|ture, that I mu&s;t appear to be the mo&s;t odious of men, if I am detected on this &s;ide matrimony. And yet I have promi&s;ed as thou &s;ee&s;t, that &s;he &s;hall &s;et out to Ham&s;tead, as &s;oon as &s;he plea&s;es in the morning, and that without condition on her &s;ide.</P>
<P>Do&s;t thou a&s;k, What I meant by this promi&s;e?</P>
<P>No <HI>new cau&s;e</HI> ari&s;ing, was the provi&s;o on my &s;ide, thou'lt remember. But there <HI>will be</HI> a new cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Dorcas &s;hould drop the promi&s;ory-note given her by her lady? Servants, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who cannot read or write, are the mo&s;t carele&s;s peo|ple in the world of written papers. Suppo&s;e I take it up? &mdash; At a time, too, that I was determined that the dear creature &s;hould be her own mi&s;tre&s;s? &mdash; Will not this detection be a <HI>new cau&s;e?</HI>&mdash;A cau&s;e that will carry again&s;t her the appearance of ingratitude with it?</P>
<P>That &s;he de&s;igned it a <HI>&s;ecret from me,</HI> argues a <HI>fear of detection,</HI> and indirectly a <HI>&s;en&s;e of guilt.</HI> I wanted a pretence. Can I have a better? If I am in a violent pa&s;&s;ion upon the detection, is not pa&s;&s;ion an univer&s;ally allowed extenuator of violence? &mdash;Is not every man and woman obliged to excu&s;e that fault in another, which at times they find attended with &s;uch ungovernable effects in them&s;elves?</P>
<P>The mother and &s;i&s;terhood, &s;uppo&s;e, brought to &s;it in judgment upon the vile corrupted?&mdash;The lea&s;t benefit that mu&s;t accrue from the accidental di&s;co|very, if not a pretence for <HI>perpetration</HI> (which, how|ever, may be the ca&s;e), an excu&s;e for renewing my orders for her detention till my return from M. Hall (the fault her own); and for keeping a &s;tricter watch over her than before; with direction to &s;end me any letters that may be written <HI>by</HI> her or <HI>to</HI> her. &mdash; And when I return, the devil's in it if I find not a way to make her choo&s;e lodgings for her&s;elf (&s;ince the&s;e are &s;o hateful to her), that &s;hall an&s;wer all my purpo&s;es;
<PB N="331" REF="332">
and yet no more appear to direct her choice, than I did before in the&s;e.</P>
<P>Thou wilt cur&s;e me, when thou come&s;t to this place. I know thou wilt. But thinke&s;t thou, that, after &s;uch a &s;eries of contrivance, I will lo&s;e this in|imitable woman, for want of a little more? A Rake's a Rake, Jack!&mdash;And what Rake is with-held by <HI>prin|ciple</HI> from the perpetration of any evil his heart is &s;et upon, and in which he thinks he can &s;ucceed?&mdash; Be&s;ides, am I not in earne&s;t as to marriage?&mdash;Will not the generality of the world acquit me, if I <HI>do</HI> marry? And what is that injury which a <HI>church-rite</HI> will at any time repair? Is not <HI>the cata&s;trophe of every &s;tory that ends in wedlock accounted happy,</HI> be the dif|ficulties in the progre&s;s to it ever &s;o great?</P>
<P>But here, how am I ingro&s;&s;ed by this lady, while poor Lord M. as Simon tells me, lies groaning in the dreadfule&s;t agonies? &mdash;What mu&s;t he &s;uffer!&mdash;Hea|ven relieve him!&mdash;I have a too compa&s;&s;ionate heart. And &s;o would the dear creature have found, could I have thought the wor&s;t of <HI>her</HI> &s;ufferings equal to the lighte&s;t of <HI>his.</HI> I mean as to fact; for, as to that part of hers, which ari&s;es from extreme &s;en&s;i|bility, I know nothing of that; and cannot therefore be an&s;werable for it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>JUST come from my charmer. She will not &s;uf|fer me to &s;ay half the obliging, the tender things, which my hone&s;t heart is ready to overflow with. A confounded &s;ituation, that, when a man finds him|&s;elf in humour to be eloquent, and pathetic at the &s;ame time, yet cannot engage the mi&s;tre&s;s of his fate to lend an ear to his fine &s;peeches.</P>
<P>I can account now, how it comes about, that lovers, when their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are cruel, run into &s;oli|tude,
<PB N="332" REF="333">
and di&s;burthen their minds to <HI>&s;tocks</HI> and <HI>&s;tones:</HI> For am I not forced to make my complaints to <HI>thee?</HI></P>
<P>She claimed the performance of my promi&s;e, the moment &s;he &s;aw me, of <HI>permitting</HI> her (haughtily &s;he &s;poke the word) to go to Ham&s;tead, as &s;oon as I were gone to Berks.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t chearfully I renewed it.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired me to give orders in her hearing.</P>
<P>I &s;ent for Dorcas, and Will. They came.&mdash;Do you both take notice (But, perhaps, Sir, I may take <HI>you</HI> with me), that your lady is to be obeyed in all her commands. She purpo&s;es to return to Ham&s;tead as &s;oon as I am gone&mdash;My dear, will you not have a &s;ervant to attend you?</P>
<P>I &s;hall want no &s;ervant there.</P>
<P>Will you take Dorcas?</P>
<P>If I &s;hould want Dorcas, I can &s;end for her.</P>
<P>Dorcas could not but &s;ay, She &s;hould be very proud&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, well, that may be at my return, if your lady permit&mdash;Shall I, my dear, call up Mrs. Sinclair, and give her orders to the &s;ame effect, in your hear|ing?</P>
<P>I de&s;ire not to &s;ee Mrs. Sinclair; nor any that be|long to her.</P>
<P>As you plea&s;e, Madam.</P>
<P>And then (the &s;ervants being withdrawn) I urged her again for the a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he would meet me at the altar on Thur&s;day next. But to no purpo&s;e. May &s;he not thank her&s;elf for all that may follow?</P>
<P>One favour, however, I would not be denied; to be admitted to pa&s;s the evening with her.</P>
<P>All &s;weetne&s;s and ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s will I be on this occa&s;ion. My whole &s;oul &s;hall be poured out to move her to forgive me. If &s;he will not, and if the promi&s;ory-note &s;hould fall in my way, my re|venge will, doubtle&s;s, take total po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me.</P>
<P>All the hou&s;e in my intere&s;t, and every one in it
<PB N="333" REF="334">
not only engaging to intimidate, and a&s;&s;i&s;t, as occa|&s;ion &s;hall offer, but &s;taking all their experience upon my &s;ucce&s;s, if it be not my own fault, what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>This, Jack, however, &s;hall be her la&s;t trial; and if &s;he behave as nobly <HI>in</HI> and <HI>after</HI> this <HI>&s;econd</HI> attempt <HI>(all her &s;en&s;es about her),</HI> as &s;he has done after the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;he will come out an angel upon full proof, in &s;pite of man, woman, and devil: Then &s;hall there be an end of all her &s;ufferings. I will then renounce that vanqui&s;hed devil, and reform. And if any vile machination &s;tart up, pre&s;uming to mi&s;lead me, I will &s;ooner &s;tab it in my heart, as it ri&s;es, than give way to it.</P>
<P>A few hours will now decide all. But whatever be the event, I &s;hall be too bu&s;y to write again, till I get to M. Hall.</P>
<P>Mean time I am in &s;trange agitations. I mu&s;t &s;up|pre&s;s them, if po&s;&s;ible, before I venture into her pre|&s;ence&mdash;My heart bounces my bo&s;om from the table. I will lay down my pen, and wholly re&s;ign to its impul&s;es.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Frid. Night, or rather Sat. Morn.</HI> 1 <HI>o'Clock.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought I &s;hould not have had either time or in|clination to write another line before I got to M. Hall. But have the fir&s;t; mu&s;t find the la&s;t; &s;ince I can neither &s;leep, nor do any thing but write, if I can do that. I am mo&s;t <HI>confoundedly</HI> out of humour. The rea&s;on let it follow; if it will follow &mdash; No pre|paration for it, from me.</P>
<P>I tried by gentlene&s;s and love to &s;often&mdash;What?&mdash; Marble. A heart incapable either of love, or gentle|ne&s;s. Her pa&s;t injuries for ever in her head. Ready to receive a favour; the permi&s;&s;ion to go to Ham|&s;tead;
<PB N="334" REF="335">
but neither to de&s;erve it, nor return any. So my &s;cheme of the gentle kind, was &s;oon given over.</P>
<P>I then wanted her to provoke me: Like a coward boy, who waits for the fir&s;t blow, before he can per&s;uade him&s;elf to fight, I half challeng'd her to challenge or defy me: She &s;eemed aware of her danger; and would not directly brave my re&s;entment: But kept &s;uch a middle cour&s;e, that I neither could find a pretence to offend, nor rea&s;on to hope; yet &s;he believed my tale, that her uncle would come to Kenti&s;h Town; and &s;eemed not to apprehend, that Tomlin&s;on was an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>She was very unea&s;y, upon the whole, in my company: Wanted often to break from me: Yet &s;o held me to my promi&s;e of permitting her to go to Ham&s;tead, that I knew not how to get off of it; altho' it was impo&s;&s;ible, in my precarious &s;ituation with her, to think of performing it.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation; the women ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t; and, if I proceeded not, as ready to ridicule me; what had I left me, but to pur&s;ue the concerted &s;cheme, and &s;eek a pretence to quarrel with her, in order to revoke my promi&s;ed permi&s;&s;ion; and to convince her, that I would not be upbraided as the mo&s;t brutal of ravi&s;hers for nothing?</P>
<P>I had agreed with the women, that if I could not find a pretence in her pre&s;ence to begin my opera|tions, the note &s;hould lie in my way, and I was to pick it up, &s;oon after her retiring from me. But I began to doubt at near ten o'clock (&s;o earne&s;t was &s;he to leave me, &s;u&s;pecting my over-warm behaviour to her, and eager gra&s;ping of her hand two or three times, with eye-&s;trings, as I felt, on the &s;train, while her eyes &s;hewed unea&s;ine&s;s and apprehen&s;ion), that if &s;he actually retired for the night, it might be a chance, whether it would be ea&s;y to come at her again. Loth therefore to run &s;uch a ri&s;que, I &s;tept
<PB N="335" REF="336">
out at a little after ten, with intent to alter the pre|concerted di&s;po&s;ition a little; &s;aying I would attend her again in&s;tantly. But as I returned, I met her at the door, intending to withdraw for the night. I could not per&s;uade her to go back: Nor had I pre|&s;ence of mind (&s;o full of complai&s;ancy as I was to her ju&s;t before) to &s;tay her by force: So &s;he &s;lid thro' my hands into her own apartment. I had no|thing to do, therefore, but to let my former concert take place.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have premi&s;ed (but care not for order of time, connexion, or any thing el&s;e) that, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, another &s;ervant of Lord M.'s, on hor&s;eback, came, to de&s;ire me to carry down with me Dr. S. my uncle having been once (<HI>in extremis,</HI> as they judge he is now) relieved and reprieved by him. I &s;ent, and engaged the Doctor to accompany me down; and am to call upon him by four this morning: Or the devil &s;hould have uncle and doctor, if I'd &s;tir, till I got all made up.</P>
<P>Poke thy damn'd no&s;e forward into the event, if thou wilt&mdash; Cur&s;e me, if thou &s;halt have it, till its proper time and place&mdash;And too &s;oon then.</P>
<P>She had hardly got into her chamber, but I found a little paper, as I was going into mine; which I took up; and, opening it (for it was carefully pinn'd in another paper), what &s;hould it be, but a pro|mi&s;ory note, given as a bribe, with a further pro|mi&s;e of a diamond ring, to induce Dorcas to favour her mi&s;tre&s;s's e&s;cape?</P>
<P>How my temper chang'd in a moment!&mdash;Ring, ring, ring, ring, my bell, with a violence enough to break the &s;tring, and as if the hou&s;e were on fire.</P>
<P>Every devil frighted into active life: The whole hou&s;e in an uproar: Up runs Will.&mdash;Sir&mdash;Sir&mdash;Sir! &mdash;Eyes goggling, mouth di&s;tended&mdash;Bid the damn'd
<PB N="336" REF="337">
toad Dorcas come hither (as I &s;tood at the &s;tair-head), in a horrible rage, and out of breath, cry'd I.</P>
<P>In &s;ight came the trembling devil&mdash;but &s;tanding aloof, from the report made her by Will. of the pa&s;&s;ion I was in, as well as from what &s;he heard.</P>
<P>Fla&s;h came out my &s;word immediately; for I had it ready on&mdash;Curs'd, confounded, villainous, bribery and corruption!&mdash;</P>
<P>Up runs &s;he to her lady's door, &s;creaming out for &s;afety and protection.</P>
<P>Good your honour, interpo&s;ed Will. for God's &s;ake&mdash;O Lord, O Lord!&mdash;receiving a good cuff.&mdash;</P>
<P>Take that, varlet, for &s;aving the ingrateful <HI>wretch</HI> from my vengeance!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Wretch!</HI> I <HI>intended</HI> to &s;ay; but if it were &s;ome other word of like ending, pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be my excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Up ran two or three of the &s;i&s;terhood, What's the matter! What's the matter!</P>
<P><HI>The matter!</HI> (for &s;till my beloved opened not her door; on the contrary, drew another bolt) This <HI>abominable</HI> Dorcas!&mdash;(Call her aunt up!&mdash;Let her &s;ee what a traitre&s;s &s;he has placed about me!&mdash;And let her bring the toad to an&s;wer for her&s;elf)&mdash; has taken a bribe, a provi&s;ion for life, to betray her tru&s;t; by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife, and fru&s;trate for ever all hopes of re|conciliation between us!</P>

<P>UP came the aunt puffing and blowing!&mdash;As &s;he hoped for mercy, &s;he was not privy to it!&mdash;She never knew &s;uch a plotting perver&s;e lady in her life! &mdash;Well might &s;ervants be at the pa&s;s they were, when &s;uch ladies as Mrs. Lovelace made no con&s;cience of corrupting them.

<P>She was &s;hewn the paper&mdash;</P>

<P>Up we all went, pa&s;&s;ing the lady's door into the dining-room, to proceed to tryal&mdash;</P>

<P>She would have &s;poken, but could not, looking down my guilt into confu&s;ion: A mou&s;e might have been heard pa&s;&s;ing over the floor, her own light feet and ru&s;tling &s;ilks could not have prevented it; for &s;he &s;eemed to tread air, and to be all &s;oul &mdash; She pa&s;&s;ed to the door, and back towards me, two or three times, before &s;peech could get the better of indignation, and at la&s;t, after twice or thrice hem|ming, to recover her articulate voice &mdash; O thou con|temptible and abandoned Lovelace, thinke&s;t thou that I &s;ee not thro' this poor villainous plot of thine, and of the&s;e thy wicked accomplices?</P>

<P>And then, <HI>turning to me,</HI> Thou, wretch, mighte&s;t more &s;ecurely have depended upon &s;uch a low con|trivance as this!&mdash;</P>
<P>And ye, vile women, who perhaps have been the ruin, body and &s;oul, of hundreds of innocents (you &s;hew me <HI>how,</HI> in full a&s;&s;embly), know, that I am

<P>They could not laugh at the poor figure I made. &mdash;Lord! how every devil, con&s;cience-&s;haken, trem|bled! &mdash;</P>
<P>What a dejection mu&s;t ever fall to the lot of guilt, were it given to innocence always thus to exert it&s;elf! &mdash;</P>
<P>And as for thee, thou vile Dorcas! &mdash; Thou <HI>double</HI> deceiver! &mdash; whining out thy pretended love for me! &mdash; Begone, wretch! &mdash; Nobody will hurt thee! &mdash;Begone, I &s;ay!&mdash;Thou ha&s;t too well acted thy part to be blamed by <HI>any</HI> here but my&s;elf&mdash; Thou art &s;afe: Thy guilt is thy &s;ecurity in &s;uch a hou&s;e as this!&mdash;Thy &s;hameful, thy poor part, thou ha&s;t as well acted, as the low farce could give thee to act! &mdash;As well as they each of them (thy &s;uperiors, tho' not thy betters), thou &s;ee&s;t, can act theirs.&mdash;Steal away into darkne&s;s!

<P>And, as I hope to live, the wench, confoundedly frightened, &s;lunk away; &s;o did her centinel Mabell; tho' I, endeavouring to rally, cried out for Dorcas to &s;tay: But I believe the devil could not have &s;topt her, when an angel bid her begone.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Life,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you do not impute to love, and to terror rai&s;ed by love, the poor figure I made before you la&s;t night, you will not do me ju&s;tice. I thought I would try to the very la&s;t moment, if, by complying with you in <HI>every-thing,</HI> I could prevail upon you to pro|mi&s;e to be mine on Thur&s;day next, &s;ince you refu&s;ed me an earlier day. Could I have been &s;o happy, you had not been hindered going to Ham&s;tead, or where|ever el&s;e you plea&s;ed. But when I could not prevail upon you to give me this a&s;&s;urance, what room had I (my demerit &s;o great) to &s;uppo&s;e, that your going thither wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not be to lo&s;e you for ever?</P>
<P>I will own to you, Madam, that ye&s;terday after|noon
<PB N="348" REF="349">
I picked up the paper dropt by Dorcas; who has confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted you in getting away, if &s;he had had an opportunity &s;o to do; and undoubtedly dropped it by <HI>accident.</HI>&mdash;And could I have prevailed upon you as to the Thur&s;day next, I would have made no u&s;e of it; &s;ecure as I &s;hould then have been, in your word given, to be mine. But when I found you inflexible, I was re&s;olved to try, if, by re&s;enting Dorcas's treachery, I could not make <HI>your</HI> pardon of <HI>me</HI> the condition of <HI>mine</HI> to <HI>her:</HI> And if not, to make a handle of it to revoke my con&s;ent to your going away from Mrs. Sinclair's; &s;ince the con&s;equence of that mu&s;t have been &s;o fatal to me.</P>
<P>So far, indeed, was my proceeding <HI>low</HI> and <HI>art|ful:</HI> And when I was challenged with it, as &s;uch, in &s;o high and noble a manner, I could not avoid taking &s;hame to my&s;elf upon it.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t permit me, Madam, to hope, that you will not puni&s;h me too heavily for &s;o poor a con|trivance, &s;ince no di&s;honour was meant you; and &s;ince, in the moment of its execution, you had as great an in&s;tance of my incapacity to defend a wrong, a low mea&s;ure, and, at the &s;ame time, of your power over me, as mortal man could give: In a word, &s;ince you mu&s;t have &s;een, that I was ab&s;olutely under the controul both of Con&s;cience, and of Love.</P>
<P>I will not offer to defend my&s;elf, for <HI>wi&s;hing you to remain where you are,</HI> till either you give me your word to meet me at the altar, on Thur&s;day; or till I have the honour of attending you, preparative to the &s;olemnity which will make that day the happie&s;t of my life.</P>
<P>I am but too &s;en&s;ible, that this kind of treatment may appear to you with the face of an arbitrary and illegal impo&s;ition: But as the con&s;equences, not only to our&s;elves, but to both our families, may be fatal, if you cannot be moved in my favour; let me be&s;eech you to forgive this act of compul&s;ion, on the &s;core of the
<PB N="349" REF="350">
nece&s;&s;ity you your dear &s;elf have laid me under to be guilty of it; and to permit the &s;olemnity of next Thur&s;day to include an act of oblivion of all pa&s;t offences.</P>
<P>The orders I have given to the people of the hou&s;e are:
<Q>That you &s;hall be obeyed in every particular that is con&s;i&s;tent with my expectations of finding you there on my return to town on Wedne&s;day next: That Mrs. Sinclair, and her nieces, having incurred your ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;hall not, without your orders, come into your pre&s;ence: That nei|ther &s;hall Dorcas, till &s;he has fully cleared her con|duct to your &s;atisfaction, be permitted to attend you: But Mabell, in her place; of whom, you &s;eemed, &s;ome time ago, to expre&s;s &s;ome liking. Will. I have left behind me to attend your com|mands. If he be either negligent or impertinent, <HI>your</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ion &s;hall be a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of him from my &s;ervice for ever. But, as to letters which may be &s;ent you, or any which you may have to &s;end, I mu&s;t humbly intreat, that none &s;uch pa&s;s <HI>from</HI> or <HI>to</HI> you, for the few days that I &s;hall be ab&s;ent.</Q>
But I do a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, that the &s;eals of both &s;orts &s;hall be &s;acred: And the letters, if &s;uch be &s;ent, &s;hall be given into your own hands, the mo|ment the ceremony is performed, or before, if you require it.</P>
<P>Mean time I will inquire, and &s;end you word, how Mi&s;s Howe does; and to what, if I can be in|formed, her long &s;ilence is owing.</P>
<P>Dr. Perkins I found here, attending my Lord, when I arrived with Dr. S. He acquaints me, that your father, mother, uncles, and the &s;till <HI>le&s;s</HI> wor|thy per&s;ons of your family, are well; and intend to be all at your uncle Harlowe's next week; I pre|&s;ume to keep his anniver&s;ary. This can make no alteration, but a happy one, as to <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> on Thur&s;|day; becau&s;e Mr. Tomlin&s;on a&s;&s;ured me, that, if
<PB N="350" REF="351">
any-thing fell out to hinder your uncle's coming up in per&s;on (which, however, he did not then expect), he would be &s;atisfied if his friend the Captain were proxy for him. I &s;hall &s;end a man and hor&s;e to|morrow to the Captain, to be at greater certainty.</P>
<P>I &s;end this by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, who will wait your plea&s;ure: Which I humbly hope will be &s;igni|fied in a line, in relation to the impatiently-wi&s;hed-for Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>My Lord, tho' hardly &s;en&s;ible, and unmindful of every-thing but of our felicity, de&s;ires his mo&s;t affec|tionate compliments to you. He has in readine&s;s to pre&s;ent you &s;everal valuables; which he hopes will be acceptable, whether he lives to &s;ee you adorn them, or not.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah and Lady Betty have al&s;o their tokens of re&s;pect ready to court your acceptance: But may heaven incline you to give the opportunity of receiving their per&s;onal compliments, and tho&s;e of my cou&s;ins Montague, before the next week be out!</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip is exceeding ill. Dr. S. has no hopes of him: The only con&s;olation I can have for the death of a relation who loves me &s;o well, if he <HI>do</HI> die, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the additional power it will put into my hands of &s;hewing how much I am,</P>

<P>ONCE more, my deare&s;t love, do I conjure you to &s;end me the four reque&s;ted words. There is no time to be lo&s;t. And I would not have next Thur&s;day go over, without being intitled to call you mine, for the world; and that as well for your &s;ake as my own. Hitherto all that has pa&s;&s;ed is between you and me only; but, after Thur&s;day, if my wi&s;hes are unan&s;wered, the whole will be before the world.</P>
<P>My Lord is extremely ill, and endures not to have me out of his &s;ight for one half-hour. But this &s;hall not weigh with me one iota, if you be plea&s;ed to hold out the olive-branch to me, in the four reque&s;ted words.</P>
<P>I have the following intelligence from Captain Tomlin&s;on.</P>
<P>All your family are at your uncle Harlowe's. Your uncle finds he cannot go up; and names Captain Tomlin&s;on for his proxy. He propo&s;es to keep all your family with him, till the Captain a&s;&s;ures him, that the ceremony is over.</P>
<P>Already he has begun, with hope of &s;ucce&s;s, to try to reconcile your mother to you.</P>
<P>My Lord M. but ju&s;t now has told me, how happy he &s;hould think him&s;elf to have an opportunity, before he dies, to &s;alute you as his niece. I have put him in hopes, that he &s;hall &s;ee you; and have told him, that I will go to town on Wedne&s;day, in order to prevail upon you to accompany me down on Thur&s;day or Friday. I have ordered a Set to be in readine&s;s to carry me up; and, were not my Lord &s;o very ill,
<PB N="353" REF="354">
my cou&s;in Montague tells me, &s;he would offer <HI>her</HI> attendance on you. If you plea&s;e, therefore, we can &s;et out for this place the moment the &s;olem|nity is performed.</P>
<P>Do not, deare&s;t creature, di&s;&s;ipate all the&s;e pro|mi&s;ing appearances, and, by refu&s;ing to &s;ave your own and your family's reputation in the eye of the world, u&s;e your&s;elf wor&s;e than the ingratefulle&s;t wretch on earth has u&s;ed you. For, if we are mar|ried, all the di&s;grace you imagine you have &s;uffered while a &s;ingle lady, will be my own; and only known to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Once more then, con&s;ider well the &s;ituation we are both in; and remember, my deare&s;t life, that Thur&s;day will be &s;oon here; and that you have no time to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>In a letter &s;ent by the me&s;&s;enger whom I di&s;patch with this, I have de&s;ired, that my friend Mr. Bel|ford, who is your very great admirer, and who knows all the &s;ecrets of my heart, will wait upon you, to know what I am to depend upon, as to the cho&s;en day.</P>
<P>Surely, my dear, you never could, at any time, &s;uffer half &s;o much from cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e, as I do.</P>
<P>If I have not an an&s;wer to this, either from your own goodne&s;s, or thro' Mr. Belford's interce&s;&s;ion, it will be too late for me to &s;et out: And Captain Tom|lin&s;on will be di&s;appointed, who goes to town on purpo&s;e to attend your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>One motive for the gentle re&s;traint I have pre|&s;umed to lay you under, is to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that might en&s;ue (as probably to the <HI>more</HI> innocent, as to the <HI>le&s;s</HI>), were you to write to any-body, while your pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o much rai&s;ed and inflamed again&s;t me. Having appri&s;ed you of my direction on this head, I wonder you &s;hould have endeavoured to &s;end a letter to Mi&s;s Howe, altho' in a cover di|rected

<P>THOU wilt &s;ee the &s;ituation I am in with Mi&s;s Harlowe by the inclo&s;ed copies of three letters; to two of which I am too much &s;corned to have one word given me in an&s;wer; and of the third (now &s;ent by the me&s;&s;enger who brings thee this) I am afraid as little notice will be taken &mdash; And if &s;o, her day of grace is ab&s;olutely over.</P>
<P>One would imagine (&s;o long u&s;ed to con&s;traint too as &s;he has been), that &s;he might have been &s;atisfied with the triumph &s;he had over us all on Friday night: A triumph that to this hour has &s;unk my pride and my vanity &s;o much, that I almo&s;t hate the words <HI>Plot, Contrivance, Scheme,</HI> and &s;hall mi&s;tru&s;t my &s;elf in future, for every one that ri&s;es to my inventive head.</P>
<P>But &s;ee&s;t thou not, that I am under a nece&s;&s;ity to continue her at Sinclair's, and to prohibit all her cor|re&s;pondences?</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="356">Now, Belford, as I really, in my pre&s;ent mood, think of nothing le&s;s than marrying her, if &s;he let not Thur&s;day &s;lip; I would have thee, in pur&s;uance of the intimation I have given her in my letter of this date, to attend her; and vow for me, &s;wear for me, bind thy &s;oul to her for my honour, and u&s;e what arguments thy friendly heart can &s;ugge&s;t, in order to procure me an an&s;wer from her; which, as thou wilt &s;ee, &s;he may give in four words only. And then I purpo&s;e to leave Lord M. (dangerou&s;ly ill as he is) and meet her at her appointed church, in order to &s;olem|nize: If &s;he will &s;ign but <HI>Cl. H.</HI> to <HI>thy</HI> writing the four words, that &s;hall do; for I would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends.</P>
<P>If &s;he &s;hould let the day go off;&mdash;I &s;hall be de&s;pe|rate!&mdash;I am intangled in my own devices, and can|not bear that &s;he &s;hould detect me.</P>
<P>O that I had been hone&s;t!&mdash;What a devil are all my plots come to! What do they end in, but one grand plot upon my&s;elf, and a title to eternal infamy and di&s;grace! But, depending on thy friendly offices, I will &s;ay no more of this.&mdash;Let her &s;end me but one line!&mdash;But one line!&mdash;Not treat me as <HI>unworthy</HI> of her notice; yet be altogether in my power&mdash;I can|not&mdash;I will not bear that.</P>
<P>My Lord, as I &s;aid, is extremely ill: The doctors give him over. He gives him&s;elf over. Tho&s;e who would not have him die, are afraid he will. But as to my&s;elf, I am doubtful: For the&s;e long and violent &s;truggles between the con&s;titution and the di&s;ea&s;e, tho' the latter has three phy&s;icians and an apothecary to help it forward (and all three, as to their pre&s;crip|tions, of different opinions too), indicate a plaguy tough habit, and favour more of recovery than death: And the more &s;o, as he has no &s;harp or acute animal organs to whet out his bodily ones, and to rai&s;e his fever above the &s;ymptomatic helpful one.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="357">Thou wilt &s;ee in the inclo&s;ed, what pains I am at to di&s;patch me&s;&s;engers; who are con&s;tantly on the road to meet each other, and one of them to link in the chain with a fourth, who&s;e &s;tation is in London, and five miles onward, or till met. But, in truth, I have &s;ome other matters for them to perform at the &s;ame time, with my Lord's banker and his lawyer; which will enable me, if his Lord&s;hip is &s;o good as to die this bout, to be an over-match for &s;ome of my other relations. I don't mean Charlotte and Patty; for they are noble girls; but others, who have been &s;cratching and clawing under-ground like &s;o many moles in my ab&s;ence; and who&s;e work|ings I have di&s;covered &s;ince I have been down, by the little heaps of dirt they have thrown up.</P>

<P>YOU mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Lovelace, from engaging in the office you would have me undertake, till I can be better a&s;&s;ured you really intend honourably at la&s;t by this much-injured lady.</P>
<P>I believe you know your friend Belford too well, to think he would be ea&s;y with you, or with any man alive, who &s;hould &s;eek to make him promi&s;e for him what he never intended to perform. And let me tell thee, that I have not much confidence in the honour of a man, who, by <HI>imitation of hands</HI> (I will only call it), has &s;hewn &s;o little regard to the honour of his own relations.</P>
<P>Only that thou ha&s;t &s;uch je&s;uitical qualifyings, or I &s;hould think thee at la&s;t touched with remor&s;e, and brought within view of being a&s;hamed of thy cur&s;ed

inventions by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of thy la&s;t: Which I heartily congratulate thee upon.</P>
<P>O the divine lady!&mdash;But I will not aggravate!</P>
<P>Yet when thou write&s;t, that, in thy <HI>pre&s;ent mood,</HI> thou thinke&s;t of marrying; and yet can&s;t &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> change thy <HI>mood:</HI> When I know thy heart is again&s;t the &s;tate:&mdash;That the four words thou courte&s;t from the lady are as much to thy purpo&s;e, as if &s;he wrote forty; &s;ince it will &s;hew &s;he can forgive the highe&s;t injury that can be offered to woman: And when I recollect, how ea&s;ily thou can&s;t find excu&s;es to po&s;t|pone; thou mu&s;t be more explicit a good deal, as to thy real intentions, and future honour, than thou art; for I cannot tru&s;t to a temporary remor&s;e; which is brought on by di&s;appointment too, and not by prin|ciple; and the like of which thou ha&s;t &s;o often got over!</P>
<P>If thou can&s;t convince me time enough for the day, that thou meane&s;t to do honourably by her, in <HI>her own</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word; or, if not time enough, wilt fix &s;ome other day (which thou oughte&s;t to leave to her option, and not bind her down for the Thur&s;|day; and the rather, as thy pretence for &s;o doing is founded on an ab&s;olute fiction); I will then mo&s;t chearfully undertake thy cau&s;e; by <HI>per&s;on,</HI> if &s;he will admit me to her pre&s;ence; if not, by <HI>pen.</HI> But, in this ca&s;e, thou mu&s;t allow me to be guarantee for thy faith. And, if &s;o, as much as I value thee, and re&s;pect thy &s;kill in all the qualifications of a gentle|man, thou may'&s;t depend upon it, that I will act up to the character of a guarantee, with more honour than the princes of our day u&s;ually do&mdash;to their &s;hame be it &s;poken.</P>
<P>Mean time, let me tell thee, that my heart bleeds for the wrongs this angelic lady has received: And if thou do&s;t <HI>not</HI> marry her, if &s;he will <HI>have</HI> thee; and, when married, make her the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of

<P>YOURS reached me this moment, by an extra|ordinary pu&s;h in the me&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>What a man of honour, thou, of a &s;udden!</P>
<P>And &s;o, in the imaginary &s;hape of a guarantee, thou threatene&s;t me!</P>
<P>Had I <HI>not</HI> been in earne&s;t as to the lady, I &s;hould not have offered to employ thee in the affair. But, let me tell thee, that <HI>had&s;t</HI> thou undertaken the ta&s;k, and I had afterwards thought fit to change my mind, I &s;hould have contented my&s;elf to tell thee, that That <HI>was</HI> my mind, when thou engaged&s;t for me; and to have given thee the rea&s;ons for the change; and then left thee to thy own direction. For never knew I what fear of man was,&mdash;nor fear of woman neither, till I became acquainted with Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe; nay, what is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> &s;urpri&s;ing, till I came to have her in my power.</P>
<P>And &s;o thou wilt not wait upon the charmer of my heart, but upon terms and conditions!&mdash;Let it alone, and be curs'd; I care not. &mdash; But &s;o much credit did I give to the value thou expre&s;&s;ed&s;t for <HI>her,</HI> that I thought the office would have been as accept|able to <HI>thee,</HI> as &s;erviceable to me; for what was it, but to endeavour to per&s;uade her to con&s;ent to the reparation of her own honour? For what have I done
<PB N="359" REF="360">
but di&s;graced my&s;elf, and been a thief to my own joys? &mdash; And if there be an union of hearts, and an intention to &s;olemnize, what is there wanting but the fooli&s;h ceremony?&mdash;And that I &s;till offer. But if &s;he will keep back her hand; if &s;he will make me hold out mine in vain&mdash;How can I help it?</P>
<P>I write her one more letter, and if, after &s;he has received that, &s;he keep &s;ullen &s;ilence, &s;he mu&s;t thank her&s;elf for what is to follow.</P>
<P>But, after all, my heart is wholly hers. I love her beyond expre&s;&s;ion; and cannot help it. I hope therefore &s;he will receive this la&s;t tender, as I wi&s;h. I hope &s;he intends not, like a true woman, to plague, and vex, and teaze me, now &s;he has found her power. If &s;he will take me to mercy now the&s;e remor&s;es are upon me; tho' I &s;corn to condition with <HI>thee</HI> for my &s;incerity; all her trials, as I have heretofore declared, &s;hall be over; and &s;he &s;hall be as happy as I can make her: For, ruminating upon all that has pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us, from the fir&s;t hour of our acquaintance till the pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t pronounce, That &s;he is Virtue it&s;elf, and, once more I &s;ay, has no equal.</P>
<P>As to what you hint of leaving to her choice an|other day, do you con&s;ider, that it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble, that my contrivances and &s;tratagems &s;hould be much longer concealed?&mdash;This makes me pre&s;s <HI>that</HI> day, tho' &s;o near; and the more, as I have made &s;o much ado about her uncle's anniver&s;ary. If &s;he &s;end me the <HI>four words,</HI> I will &s;pare no fatigue to be in time, if not for the canonical hour at church, for &s;ome other hour of the day in her own apartment, or any other; for money will do every thing: And <HI>that</HI> I have never &s;pared in this affair.</P>
<P>To &s;hew thee, that I am not at enmity with thee, I inclo&s;e the copies of two letters: One to her: It is the <HI>fourth,</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the <HI>la&s;t</HI> on the &s;ubject: The other to Captain Tomlin&s;on; calculated, as thou wilt &s;ee, for him to &s;hew her.</P>

<P>NOT one line, my deare&s;t life, not one word, in an&s;wer to three letters I have written! The time is now &s;o &s;hort, that this <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the la&s;t letter that can reach you on this &s;ide of the important hour that might make us legally one.</P>
<P>My friend Mr. Belford is apprehen&s;ive, that he cannot wait upon you in time, by rea&s;on of &s;ome ur|gent affairs of his own.</P>
<P>I the le&s;s regret the di&s;appointment, becau&s;e I have procured a <HI>more</HI> acceptable per&s;on, as I hope, to attend you; Captain Tomlin&s;on I mean: To whom I had applied for this purpo&s;e, before I had Mr. Belford's an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I was the more &s;olicitous to obtain this favour from him, becau&s;e of the office he is to take upon him, as I humbly pre&s;ume to hope, to-morrow. That office obliged him to be in town as this day: And I acquainted him with my unhappy &s;ituation with you; and de&s;ired, that he would &s;hew me, on this occa&s;ion, that I had as much of his favour and friend&s;hip, as your uncle had; &s;ince the whole treaty mu&s;t be broken off, if he could not prevail upon you in my behalf.</P>
<P>He will di&s;patch the me&s;&s;enger directly; whom I propo&s;e to meet in per&s;on at Slough; either to pro|ceed onward to London with a joyful heart, or to return back to M. Hall, with a broken one.</P>
<P>I ought not (but cannot help it) to anticipate the plea&s;ure Mr. Tomlin&s;on propo&s;es to him&s;elf, in ac|quainting
<PB N="361" REF="362">
you with the likelihood there is of your mo|ther's &s;econding your uncle's views. For, it &s;eems, he has privately communicated to her his laudable intentions: And <HI>her</HI> re&s;olution depends, as well as <HI>his,</HI> upon what to-morrow will produce.</P>
<P>Di&s;appoint not then, I be&s;eech you, for an hun|dred per&s;ons &s;akes, as well as for mine, <HI>that</HI> uncle, and <HI>that</HI> mother, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure I have heard you &s;o often deplore.</P>
<P>You may think it impo&s;&s;ible for me to reach Lon|don by the canonical hour. If it &s;hould, the cere|mony may be performed in your own apartment, at any time in the day, or at night: So that Captain Tomlin&s;on may have it to aver to your uncle, that it was performed on his anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Tell but the Captain, that you <HI>forbid me not</HI> to attend you: And that &s;hall be &s;ufficient for bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you, on the wings of Love,</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> M'DONALD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE bearer of this has a letter to carry to the lady <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Viz. the preceding letter.</NOTE>. I have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it; which I inclo&s;e, that you may not mi&s;|take your cue.</P>
<P>You will judge of my rea&s;ons for ante-dating the inclo&s;ed &s;ealed one <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See the next letter.</NOTE>, directed to you by the name of Tomlin&s;on, which you are to &s;hew the lady, as in confidence. You will open it of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="363">I doubt not your dexterity and management, dear M'Donald; nor your zeal, e&s;pecially as the hope of cohabitation mu&s;t now be given up. Impo&s;&s;ible to be carried is that &s;cheme. I might break her heart, but not incline her will. Am in earne&s;t therefore to marry her, if &s;he let not the day &s;lip.</P>
<P>Improve upon the hint of her mother: That mu&s;t touch her. But John Harlowe, <HI>remember,</HI> has <HI>pri|vately</HI> engaged that Lady&mdash;<HI>Privately,</HI> I &s;ay; el&s;e (not to mention the rea&s;on for her uncle Harlowe's former expedient) you know, &s;he might find means to get a letter away to the one or the other, to know the truth; or to Mi&s;s Howe, to engage <HI>her</HI> to inquire into it: And if &s;he &s;hould, the word <HI>privately</HI> will ac|count for the uncle's and mother's denying it.</P>
<P>However, fail not, as from me, to charge our mother and her nymphs, to redouble their vigilance both as to her per&s;on and letters. All's upon a cri|&s;is now. But &s;he mu&s;t not be treated ill neither.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day over, I &s;hall know what to re&s;olve upon.</P>
<P>If nece&s;&s;ary, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume authority. The de|vil's in't, if &s;uch a girl as this &s;hall awe a man of your years and experience. Fly out, if &s;he doubt your honour. Spirits <HI>naturally</HI> &s;oft may be beat out of their play and borne down (tho' ever &s;o much rai&s;ed) by higher anger. All women are cowards at bottom: Only violent when they <HI>may.</HI> I have often &s;tormed a girl out of her mi&s;tru&s;ts, and made her yield before &s;he knew where &s;he was to the point indig|nantly <HI>mi&s;tru&s;ted</HI>; and that to make up with me, tho' I was the aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>If this matter &s;ucceed as I'd have it (or if <HI>not,</HI> and do not fail by your fault) I will take you off of the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing your cur&s;ed Smuggling; which otherwi&s;e may one day end fatally for you.</P>
<P>We are none of us perfect, M^cDonald. This &s;weet lady makes me &s;erious &s;ometimes in &s;pite of my
<PB N="363" REF="364">
heart. But as private vices are le&s;s blameable than public; and as I think <HI>Smuggling</HI> (as it is called) a National evil; I have no doubt to pronounce you a much wor&s;e man than my&s;elf, and as &s;uch &s;hall take plea&s;ure in reforming you.</P>
<P>I &s;end you inclo&s;ed ten guineas, as a &s;mall earne&s;t of further favours. Hitherto you have been a very clever fellow.</P>
<P>As to cloaths for Thur&s;day, Monmouth-&s;treet will afford a ready &s;upply. Cloaths quite new would make your condition &s;u&s;pected. But you may defer that care, till you &s;ee if &s;he can be prevailed upon. Your riding-dre&s;s will do for the fir&s;t vi&s;it. Nor let your boots be over clean: I have always told you the con&s;equence of attending to the <HI>minutiae,</HI> where art (or <HI>impo&s;ture,</HI> as the ill-manner'd would call it) is de&s;igned&mdash;Your linen rumpled and &s;oily, when you wait upon her &mdash; Ea&s;y terms the&s;e! &mdash; Ju&s;t come to town &mdash; Remem|ber (as formerly) to loll, to throw out your legs, to &s;troke and gra&s;p down your ruffles, as if of &s;ignifi|cance enough to be carele&s;s. What tho' the pre&s;ence of a fine lady would require a different behaviour, are you not of years to di&s;pen&s;e with politene&s;s? You have no de&s;ign upon her, you know. Are a father your&s;elf of daughters as old as &s;he. Evermore is <HI>parade</HI> and <HI>ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;u&s;pectable: It mu&s;t &s;hew either a fooli&s;h head, or a knavi&s;h heart. Make your|&s;elf of <HI>con&s;equence</HI> therefore; and you will be treated as a <HI>man</HI> of con&s;equence. I have often more than half ruined my&s;elf by my complai&s;ance, and, being afraid of controul, have brought controul upon my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I think I have no more to &s;ay at pre&s;ent. I intend to be at Slough, or on the way to it, as by mine to the lady. Adieu, hone&s;t M^cDonald.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Capt. Tomlin&s;on,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN unhappy mi&s;under&s;tanding having ari&s;en be|tween the deare&s;t lady in the world and me (the particulars of which &s;he perhaps may give you, but I will not, becau&s;e I might be thought partial to my|&s;elf); and the refu&s;ing to an&s;wer my mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and re&s;pectful letters; I am at a mo&s;t perplexing un|certainty, whether &s;he will meet us, or not, next Thur&s;day, to &s;olemnize.</P>
<P>My Lord is &s;o extremely ill, that if I thought &s;he would not oblige me, I would defer going up to town for two or three days. He cares not to have me out of his &s;ight: Yet is impatient to &s;alute my Beloved as his niece before he dies. This I have promi&s;ed to give him an opportunity to do; intending, if the dear creature will make me happy, to &s;et out with her for this place directly from church.</P>
<P>With regret I &s;peak it of the charmer of my &s;oul; but irreconcileablene&s;s is her family-fault: The le&s;s ex|cu&s;eable indeed in <HI>her,</HI> as &s;he her&s;elf &s;uffers by it in &s;o high a degree from her own relations.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as you <HI>intended</HI> to be in town &s;ome time before Thur&s;day, if it be not too great an inconvenience to you, I could be glad you would go up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for my &s;ake: And this I the more boldly reque&s;t, as I pre&s;ume that a man who has &s;o many great affairs of his own in hand as you have, would be glad to be at a certainty him&s;elf as to the day.</P>
<P>You, Sir, can &s;o pathetically and ju&s;tly &s;et before er the unhappy con&s;equences that will follow if the

day be po&s;tponed, as well with regard to her uncle's di&s;appointment, as to the part <HI>you have a&s;&s;ured me</HI> her mother is willing to take in the wi&s;hed-for re|conciliation, that I have great hopes &s;he will &s;uffer her&s;elf to be prevailed upon. And a man and hor&s;e &s;hall be in waiting to take your di&s;patches, and bring them to me.</P>
<P>But if you cannot prevail in my favour, you will be plea&s;ed to &s;atisfy your friend Mr. John Harlowe, that it is not my fault that he is not obliged. I am, dear Sir,</P>

<P>You mu&s;t not, Sir, be &s;urpri&s;ed. It is a trouble to me to be the relater of the bad news: But &s;o it is, the lady is gone off. She was mi&s;&s;ed but half an hour before I came.</P>

<P>I Have plaguy news to acquaint thee with. Mi&s;s Harlowe is gon off!&mdash;Quite gon, by my &s;oul!&mdash; I have not time for particulars, your &s;ervant being going off.

<P>THOU ha&s;t heard from M^cDonald and Mowbray the news. Bad or good, I know not which thou'lt deem it. I only wi&s;h I could have given thee joy upon the &s;ame account, before the unhappy lady was &s;educed from Ham&s;tead: For then of what an ingrateful villainy had&s;t thou been &s;pared the perpe|tration, which now thou ha&s;t to an&s;wer for!</P>
<P>I came to town purely to &s;erve thee with her, ex|pecting that thy next would &s;atisfy me that I might endeavour it without di&s;honour: And at fir&s;t when I found her gone, I half pitied thee; for now wilt thou be inevitably blown up: And in what an exe|crable light wilt thou appear to all the world! Poor Lovelace! Caught in thy own &s;nares! Thy puni&s;h|ment is but beginning!</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="369">But to my narrative; for I &s;uppo&s;e thou expecte&s;t all particulars from me, &s;ince Mowbray has informed thee that I have been collecting them.</P>
<Q><P>The noble exertion of &s;pirit &s;he had made on Fri|day night, had, it &s;eems, greatly di&s;ordered her; in&s;omuch that &s;he was not vi&s;ible till Saturday evening; when Mabell &s;aw her, and &s;he &s;eemed to be very ill: But on Sunday morning, having dre&s;s'd her&s;elf, as if de&s;igning to go to church, &s;he order'd Mabell to get her a coach to the door.</P>
<P>The wench told her, She was to obey her in every thing but the calling of a coach or chair.</P>
<P>She &s;ent for Will. and gave him the &s;ame com|mand.</P>
<P>He pleaded his ma&s;ter's orders to the contrary, and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon this, down &s;he went her&s;elf, and would have gone out without ob&s;ervation: But finding the &s;treet-door double-lock'd, and the key not in the lock, &s;he &s;tept into the &s;treet-parlour, and would have thrown up the &s;a&s;h to call out to the people pa&s;&s;ing by, as they doubted not: But that, &s;ince her la&s;t attempt of the &s;ame nature, had been fa&s;ten'd down.</P>
<P>Hereupon &s;he re&s;olutely &s;tept into Mrs. Sinclair's parlour in the back-hou&s;e; where were the old devil and her two partners; and demanded the key of the &s;treet-door, or to have it opened for her.</P>
<P>They were all &s;urpri&s;ed; but de&s;ired to be ex|cu&s;ed, pleading your orders.</P>
<P>She a&s;&s;erted, that you had no authority over her; and never &s;hould have any: That their pre&s;ent re|fu&s;al was their own act and deed: She &s;aw the in|tent of their back-hou&s;e, and the rea&s;on of putting her there: She pleaded her condition and fortune; and &s;aid, They had no way to avoid utter ruin, but by opening their doors to her, or by murdering
<PB N="369" REF="370">
her, and burying her in their garden or cellar, too deep for detection: That already what had been done to her was puni&s;hable by death: And bid them at their peril detain her.</P></Q>
<P>What a noble, what a right &s;pirit has this charm|ing creature, in ca&s;es that will ju&s;tify an exertion of &s;pirit!&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>They an&s;wer'd, That Mr. Lovelace could prove his marriage, and would indemnify them. And they all would have vindicated their behaviour on Friday night, and the reputation of their hou&s;e: But refu&s;ing to hear them on that topic, &s;he flung from them, threatening.</P>
<P>She then went up half a dozen &s;tairs in her way to her own apartment: But, as if &s;he had bethought her&s;elf, down &s;he &s;tept again, and proceeded to|wards the &s;treet-parlour; &s;aying, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by the infamous Dorcas, I'll make my&s;elf protectors, tho' the windows &s;uffer: But that wench, of her own head, on the lady's going out of that parlour to Mrs. Sinclair's, had lock'd the door, and taken out the key: So that finding her&s;elf di&s;appointed, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and went menacing and &s;ob|bing up &s;tairs again.</P>
<P>She made no other attempt till the effectual one. Your letters and me&s;&s;ages, they &s;uppo&s;ed, coming &s;o fa&s;t upon one another (tho' &s;he would not an&s;wer one of them) gave <HI>her</HI> &s;ome amu&s;ement, and an a&s;|&s;urance to <HI>them,</HI> that &s;he would at la&s;t forgive you; and that then all would end as you wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The women, in pur&s;uance of your orders, of|fer'd not to obtrude them&s;elves upon her; and Dorcas al&s;o kept out of her &s;ight all the re&s;t of Sunday; al&s;o on Monday and Tue&s;day. But by the lady's conde&s;cen&s;ion (even to familiarity) to Mabell, they imagined, that &s;he mu&s;t be working in her mind all that time to get away: They therefore redoubled their cautions to the wench: Who told
<PB N="370" REF="371">
them &s;o faithfully all that pa&s;&s;ed between her lady and her, that they had no doubt of her fidelity to her wicked tru&s;t.</P>
<P>'Tis probable &s;he might have been contriving &s;omething all this time; but &s;aw no room for per|fecting any &s;cheme: The contrivance by which &s;he effected her e&s;cape &s;eems to me not to have been fallen upon till the very day; &s;ince it depended partly upon the <HI>weather,</HI> as it proved. But it is evident &s;he hoped &s;omething from Mabell's &s;im|plicity, or gratitude, or compa&s;&s;ion, by cultivating all the time her civility to her.</P>
<P>Polly waited on her early on Wedne&s;day morn|ing; and met with a better reception than &s;he had <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to expect. She complained however with warmth of her confinement. Polly &s;aid, There would be an happy end to it (if it <HI>were</HI> a confine|ment) next day, &s;he pre&s;umed. She ab&s;olutely declared to the contrary, in the way Polly meant it; and &s;aid, That Mr. Lovelace, on his <HI>return</HI> [<HI>Which look'd as if &s;he intended to wait for it</HI>], &s;hould have rea&s;on to repent the orders he had given, as <HI>they all &s;hould</HI> their ob&s;ervance of them: Let him &s;end twenty letters, &s;he would not an&s;wer one, be the con&s;equence what it would; nor give him hope of the lea&s;t favour, while &s;he was in that hou&s;e. She had given Mrs. Sinclair and them&s;elves fair warn|ing, &s;he &s;aid: No orders of another ought to make them detain a free per&s;on: But having made an open attempt to <HI>go,</HI> and been detained by them, &s;he was the calmer, &s;he told Polly; Let <HI>them</HI> look to the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But yet &s;he &s;poke this with temper; and Polly gave it as her opinion, (with apprehen&s;ion for their own &s;afety) that, having &s;o good a handle to puni&s;h them all, &s;he would not go away, if &s;he might. And what, inferred Polly, is the indemnity of a man who has committed the vile&s;t of rapes on a
<PB N="371" REF="372">
per&s;on of condition; and mu&s;t him&s;elf, if pro&s;e|cuted for it, either fly, or be hang'd?</P>
<P>Sinclair, &s;o I will &s;till call her, upon this repre|&s;entation of Polly, fore&s;aw, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>the ruin of her poor hou&s;e</HI> in the i&s;&s;ue of this <HI>&s;trange</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;he call'd it; and Sally and Dorcas bore their parts in the apprehen&s;ion: And this put them upon thinking it advi&s;eable for the future, that the &s;treet-door &s;hould generally in the day-time be only left upon a bolt-latch, as they call'd it, which any|body might open on the in&s;ide; and that the key &s;hould be kept in the door; that their numerous <HI>comers</HI> and <HI>goers,</HI> as they called their gue&s;ts, &s;hould be able to give evidence, that &s;he might have gone out if &s;he would: Not forgetting, however, to re|new their orders to Will. to Dorcas, to Mabell, and the re&s;t, to redouble their vigilance on this oc|ca&s;ion, to prevent her e&s;cape: &mdash; None of them doubting, at the &s;ame time, that her love of a man &s;o con&s;iderable in <HI>their</HI> eyes, and the pro&s;pect of what was to happen as &s;he had rea&s;on to believe on Thur&s;day, her uncle's birth-day, would (tho' perhaps not till the la&s;t hour, for her <HI>pride-&s;ake,</HI> was their word) engage her to change her tem|per.</P>
<P>They believe, that &s;he di&s;cover'd the key to be left in the door; for &s;he was down more than once to walk in the little garden, and &s;eemed to ca&s;t her eye each time to the &s;treet-door.</P>
<P>About eight ye&s;terday morning, an hour after Polly had left her, &s;he told Mabell, She was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould not live long; and having a good many &s;uits of apparel, which after her death would be of no u&s;e to any-body &s;he valued, &s;he would give her a brown lu&s;tring gown, which, with &s;ome al|terations, to make it more &s;uitable to her degree, would a great while &s;erve her for a Sunday wear; for that &s;he (Mabell) was the only per&s;on in that
<PB N="372" REF="373">
hou&s;e of whom &s;he could think without terror or antipathy.</P>
<P>Mabell expre&s;&s;ing her gratitude upon the occa&s;ion, the lady &s;aid, She had nothing to employ her&s;elf about; and if &s;he could get a workwoman directly, &s;he would look over her things then, and give her what &s;he intended for her.</P>
<P>Her mi&s;tre&s;s's mantua-maker, the maid replied, lived but a little way off; and &s;he doubted not that &s;he could procure <HI>her,</HI> or one of her journey-women, to alter the gown out of hand.</P>
<P>I will give you al&s;o, &s;aid &s;he, a quilted coat, which will require but little alteration, if any; for you are much about my &s;tature: But the gown I will give directions about, becau&s;e the &s;leeves and the robings and facings mu&s;t be alter'd for your wear, being, I believe, above your &s;tation: And try, &s;aid &s;he, if you can get the workwoman, and we'll advi&s;e about it. If &s;he cannot come now, let her come in the afternoon; but I had rather now, be|cau&s;e it will amu&s;e me to give you a lift.</P>
<P>Then &s;tepping to the window, It rains, &s;aid &s;he [and &s;o it had done all the morning]: Slip on the hood and &s;hort cloak I have &s;een you wear, and come to me when you are ready to go out, becau&s;e you &s;hall bring me in &s;omething that I want.</P>
<P>Mabell equipp'd her&s;elf accordingly, and received her commands to buy her &s;ome trifles, and then left her; but, in her way out, &s;tept into the back parlour, where Dorcas was with Mrs. Sinclair, telling her where &s;he was going, and on what account, bidding Dorcas look out till &s;he came back. So faithful was the wench to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, and &s;o little had the lady's genero&s;ity wrought upon her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair commended her; Dorcas envied her, and took her cue: And Mabell &s;oon returned with the mantua-maker's journeywoman (She was
<PB N="373" REF="374">
re&s;olved, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would not come without her); and then Dorcas went off guard.</P>
<P>The lady look'd out the gown and petticoat, and before the workwoman cau&s;ed Mabell to try it on; and, that it might &s;it the better, made the willing wench pull off her upper petticoat, and put on that &s;he gave her. Then &s;he bid them go in|to Mr. Lovelace's apartment, and contrive about it before the pier-gla&s;s there, and &s;tay till &s;he came to them, to give them her opinion.</P>
<P>Mabell would have taken her own cloaths, and hood, and &s;hort cloak with her: But her lady &s;aid, No matter; you may put them on again here, when we have con&s;ider'd about the alterations: There's no occa&s;ion to litter the other room.</P>
<P>They went; and in&s;tantly, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;he &s;lipt on Mabell's gown and petticoat over her own, which was white damask, and put on the wench's hood, &s;hort cloak, and ordinary apron, and down &s;he went.</P>
<P>Hearing &s;omebody tripping along the pa&s;&s;age, both Will. and Dorcas whipt to the inner-hall door, and &s;aw her; but, taking her for Mabell, Are you going far, Mabell, cried Will.?</P>
<P>Without turning her face, or an&s;wering, &s;he held out her hand, pointing to the &s;tairs; which they con&s;trued as a caution for them to look out in her ab&s;ence; and &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he would not be long gone, as &s;he had not formally repeated her caution to them, up went Will. tarrying at the &s;tairs-head in expectation of the &s;uppo&s;ed Mabell's return.</P>
<P>Mabell and the workwoman waited a good while, amu&s;ing them&s;elves not di&s;agreeably, the one with contriving in the way of her bu&s;ine&s;s, the other delighting her&s;elf with her fine gown and coat: But at la&s;t, wondering the lady did not come in to them, Mabell tiptoed it to her door, and tapping, and not being an&s;wer'd, &s;tept into the chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375">
Will. at that in&s;tant, from his &s;tation at the &s;tairs-head, &s;eeing Mabell in her <HI>lady</HI>'s cloaths; for he had been told of the pre&s;ent [Gifts to &s;ervants fly from &s;ervant to &s;ervant in a minute] was very much &s;urpri&s;ed, having, as he thought, ju&s;t &s;een her go out in <HI>her own</HI>; and, &s;tepping up, met her at the door. How the devil can this be, &s;aid he? Ju&s;t now you went out in your own dre&s;s! How came you here in This? And how could you pa&s;s me un&s;een? But neverthele&s;s, ki&s;&s;ing her, &s;aid, He would now brag he had ki&s;&s;ed his lady, or one in her cloaths.</P>
<P>I am glad, Mr. William, cried Mabell, to &s;ee you here &s;o diligently. But know you where my lady is?</P>
<P>In my ma&s;ter's apartment, i'n't &s;he? interro|gated Will. Was &s;he not talking with you this moment?</P>
<P>No, that's Mrs. Dolins's journeywoman.</P>
<P>They both &s;tood agha&s;t, as they &s;aid; Will. again recollecting he had &s;een Mabell, as he thought, go out in her own cloaths. And while they were de|bating and wondering, up comes Dorcas with your fourth letter, ju&s;t then brought for her lady; and &s;eeing Mabell dre&s;s'd out (whom &s;he had likewi&s;e be|held a little before, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, in her common cloaths), &s;he joined in the wonder; till Mabell, re-entering the lady's apartment, mi&s;&s;ed her own cloaths; and then &s;u&s;pecting what had happen'd, and letting the others into the ground of her &s;u&s;picion, they all agreed, that &s;he had certainly e&s;caped: And then followed &s;uch an uproar of mutual accu&s;ation, and <HI>You &s;hould have done this,</HI> and <HI>You &s;hould have done that,</HI> as alarmed the whole hou&s;e; every apartment in both hou&s;es giving up its devil, to the number of fourteen or fifteen, in|cluding the mother and her partners.</P>
<P>Will. told them <HI>his</HI> &s;tory; and then ran out, as
<PB N="375" REF="376">
on the like occa&s;ion formerly, to make inquiry whether the lady was &s;een by any of the coach|men, chairmen, or porters, plying in that neigh|bourhood: While Dorcas cleared her&s;elf imme|diately, and that at the poor Mabell's expence, who made a figure as guilty as aukward, having on the &s;u&s;pected price of her treachery; which Dor|cas, out of envy, was ready to tear from her back.</P>
<P>Hereupon all the pack open'd at the poor wench, while the mother, foaming at the mouth, bellow'd out her orders for &s;ei&s;ing the &s;u&s;pected offender; who could neither be heard in her own defence, nor, <HI>had</HI> &s;he been heard, would have been believed.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a perfidious wretch &s;hould ever di&s;|grace <HI>her</HI> hou&s;e, was the mother's cry! <HI>Good</HI> peo|ple <HI>might</HI> be corrupted; but it was a fine thing if &s;uch a hou&s;e as <HI>hers</HI> could not be faithfully &s;erved by cur&s;ed creatures, who hired them&s;elves upon <HI>character,</HI> and had no pretence to <HI>principle!</HI> &mdash; Damn her, the wretch proceeded!&mdash;She had no patience with her! Call the cook, and call the &s;cullion!</P>
<P>They were at hand.</P>
<P>See that guilty <HI>pyeball</HI> devil, was her word [her lady's gown upon her back]&mdash;But I'll puni&s;h her for a warning to all betrayers of their tru&s;t. Put on the great gridiron this moment (an oath or a cur&s;e at every word): Make up a roaring fire:&mdash;The cleaver bring me this in&s;tant:&mdash;I'll cut her into quarters with my own hands; and carbonade and broil the traitre&s;s, for a fea&s;t to all the dogs and cats in the neighbourhood; and eat the fir&s;t &s;lice of the toad my&s;elf, without &s;alt or pepper.</P>
<P>The poor Mabell, frighten'd out of her wits, expected every moment to be torn in pieces, having half a &s;core open-claw'd paws upon her all at once. She promi&s;ed to confe&s;s all: But that All, when &s;he had obtained a hearing, was nothing; for <HI>nothing</HI> had &s;he to confe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="377">
Sally hereupon, with a <HI>cur&s;e of mercy,</HI> ordered her to retire; undertaking that &s;he and Polly would examine her them&s;elves, that they might be able to write all particulars to <HI>his Honour</HI>; and then, if &s;he could not clear her&s;elf, or, if guilty, give &s;ome account of the lady (who had been &s;o <HI>wicked</HI> as to give them all this trouble) &s;o as they might get her again, then the cleaver and gridiron might go to work with all their hearts.</P>
<P>The wench, glad of this reprieve, went up &s;tairs; and while Sally was laying out the law, and prating away in her u&s;ual dictatorial manner, whipt on an|other gown, and &s;liding down &s;tairs, e&s;caped to her relations. And this flight, which was certainly more owing to <HI>terror</HI> than <HI>guilt,</HI> was, in the true Old Bailey con&s;truction, made a confirmation of the latter.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e are the particulars of Mi&s;s Harlowe's flight. Thou'lt hardly think me too minute.&mdash;How I long to triumph over thy impatience and fury on the oc|ca&s;ion!</P>
<P>Let me be&s;eech thee, my dear Lovelace, in thy next letter, to rave mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly!&mdash;I &s;hall be griev|ou&s;ly di&s;appointed, if thou do&s;t not.</P>
<P>Where, Lovelace, can the poor lady be gone? And who can de&s;cribe the di&s;tre&s;s &s;he mu&s;t be in?</P>
<P>By your former letters, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he can have very little money: Nor, by the &s;udden|ne&s;s of her flight, more cloaths than tho&s;e &s;he has on. And thou knowe&s;t who once &s;aid <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 17.</NOTE>,
<Q>Her Parents will not receive her: Her Uncles will not entertain her: Her Norton is in their direction, and cannot: Mi&s;s Howe dare not: She has not one friend or intimate in town; intirely a &s;tranger to it.</Q>
And, let me add, has been de&s;poiled of her honour by the man for whom &s;he made all the&s;e
<PB N="377" REF="378">
&s;acrifices; and who &s;tood bound to her by a thou&s;and oaths and vows, to be her hu&s;band, her protector, and friend!</P>
<P>How &s;trong mu&s;t be her re&s;entment of the bar|barous treatment &s;he has received! How worthy of her&s;elf, that it has made her <HI>hate</HI> the man &s;he once <HI>loved!</HI> And, rather than marry him, choo&s;e to ex|po&s;e her di&s;grace to the whole world; to forego the reconciliation with her friends which her heart was &s;o &s;et upon; and to hazard a thou&s;and evils to which her youth and her &s;ex may too probably expo&s;e an indigent and friendle&s;s beauty.</P>
<P>Remembere&s;t thou not that home pu&s;h upon thee, in one of the papers written in her delirium; of which however it favours not?&mdash;</P>
<P>I will a&s;&s;ure thee, that I have very often &s;ince mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon it: And as thy intended &s;e|cond outrage convinces me, that it made no impre&s;|&s;ion upon thee then, and perhaps thou ha&s;t never thought of it &s;ince, I will tran&s;cribe the &s;entence.</P>
<P><Q>If, as Religion teaches us, God will judge us, in a great mea&s;ure, by our benevolent or evil actions to one another&mdash;O wretch, bethink thee, in time bethink thee, how great mu&s;t be thy con|demnation <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 237. of this Volume.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>And is this amiable doctrine the Sum of Religion? Upon my faith I believe it is. For, to indulge a &s;erious thought, &s;ince we are not athei&s;ts, except in <HI>practice,</HI> Does God, the BEING of beings, want any thing of us for HIMSELF? And does he not in|join us works of mercy to one another, as the means to obtain <HI>His</HI> mercy? A &s;ublime principle, and worthy of the SUPREME SUPERINTENDENT and FATHER of all things!&mdash;But, if we <HI>are</HI> to be judged by this noble principle, what, <HI>indeed,</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>thy</HI> con|demnation on the &s;core of this lady only! And what <HI>mine,</HI> and what all our <HI>confraternity</HI>'s, on the &s;core
<PB N="378" REF="379">
of other women; tho' we are none of us half &s;o bad as thou art, as well for want of inclination, I hope, as of opportunity!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add, that, as well for thy <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, as for the <HI>lady</HI>'s, I wi&s;h ye were yet to be married to each other. It is the only medium that can be hit upon, to &s;alve the honour of both. All that's pa&s;t may yet be concealed from the world, and from her relations; and thou may&s;t make amends for all her &s;ufferings, if thou re&s;olve&s;t to be a tender and kind hu&s;band to her.</P>
<P>And if this really be thy intention, I will accept, with plea&s;ure, of a commi&s;&s;ion from thee, that &s;hall tend to promote &s;o good an end, whenever &s;he can be found; that is to &s;ay, if &s;he will admit to her pre|&s;ence a man who profe&s;&s;es friend&s;hip to thee. Nor can I give a greater demon&s;tration, that I am</P>
