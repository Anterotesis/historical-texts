<SALUTE>Mo&s;t onnurable Sir, my ever onnurd Ma&s;ter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO hear of &s;trange queerums and quick&s;ets, that have a bin trap laid for your ever gracious onnur, and for the mercifool lovin kindne&s;s of &s;weet mi&s;&s;ee. Whereof I be all in a quandary, for it
<PB N="2" REF="4">
do &s;eem I wus within an ames ace of a havin bin chou&s;e flickur'd me&s;elf. Whereby I paradventerd before to tell your noble onnur my poor thofts on this here Mr. Clifton match marriage, which is all again&s;t the grain. And this I do hope your ever onnurable onnur will pry into, and &s;ee with your own eyes.</P>
<P>Whereof I have a bin ruminatin of many thinks lately, and of the ups and downs of life, &s;o that I &s;hould &s;ing oh be joyfool if as your onnur would but turn them in your thofts, as I have done. Whereby my &s;on has a bin down with me; and I do find that &s;ooth and trooth he be verily a &s;on of my own begettin; and thof I &s;ay it a man may be proud of &s;itch a &s;on; and as your ever gra|cious
<PB N="3" REF="5">
onnur wus mo&s;t mercifoolly plea&s;ed to &s;ifflicate, a wus born a gentleman, for a has his head fool and fool of fine notions.</P>
<P>Whereby if your onnurable onnur will but a be plea&s;ed to lend a mercifool ear to me, why mayhap I &s;hould a be willin to come down with the kole to your onnur's heart's content. Why not? For I have a talked matters over with my &s;on, and a has &s;aid a many glorious thinks of your onnur and of &s;weet mer|cifool mi&s;&s;ee, all a witch a learned from me. For why? He is my own &s;on, and of the i&s;&s;ue of my loins, and I did always giv'n the be&s;t of advice. A had his whole feedin and breedin from me, and as a wus always fain to be a man of learnin
<PB N="4" REF="6">
why I taught him his letters me&s;elf; whereof I have now rea&s;on to be proud of 'n.</P>
<P>But that is not whereof of a what I wus a goin to think to &s;ay. I wus about to paradventer to propo&s;al to your onnur that, if thinks might behappen to come to pa&s;s in the manner of mercifool lovin kindne&s;s and gracious condy&s;en&s;ion, the wherewithalls &s;hould a be forth cummin to the tune of fifty thou&s;and pounds: that is with the betokenin of all proper &s;ecurities of parchments and deeds and doo&s;oors to be fir&s;t &s;igned and &s;tipilated, as heretofore have bin on like future occa&s;ions. Take me ritely, your onnur; I mean for the twenty thou&s;and pounds. For why?
<PB N="5" REF="7">
I me&s;elf will be &s;o all bountifool as to come down on the nail head with thirty thou&s;and for my &s;on. And then we &s;hall &s;ee who will be a better gen|tleman, as your onnurable onnur wus mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to kappai&s;hus him?</P>
<P>Whereby Wenbourne Hill would then be in all its glory; and mayhap your ever gracious onnur might in &s;itch a ca&s;e again go on with your improof|ments. And who can &s;ay but the wil|durne&s;s might a begin to flouri&s;h? So that if your noble onnur will but think of that, why thinks may behappen to begin to take a new turn, and there may be mirth and merry days again at Wen|bourne Hill. For I do know in your
<PB N="6" REF="8">
heart your onnur do lamentation the lo&s;s of all your fine ta&s;te, and elegunt ideers, and plans, and alterations; all of a witch have a bin &s;o many years a carryin on and a compa&s;&s;in at Wen|bourne Hill.</P>
<P>Whereof I umbelly condy&s;end to intreat your noble onnur would a give the&s;e thinks a thinkin. For why? The lawyers might a then be &s;toptt, and a &s;poke might a behappen to be put in the wheel of the foreclo&s;ures; witch if not, as your noble onnur al|ready knows, may not a turn out to be altogether quite &s;o agreeable, unle&s;s your ever gracious and onnurable onnur &s;hould be &s;o all mercifool as to rite to me; whereof I could then give them

the whys and the wherefores, and all thinks would be &s;mooth and &s;milin.</P>
<P>I be&s;iege your mo&s;t noble onnur to ponderate mercifooly of the&s;e thinks, and of a dockin of the entail, and of a &s;ettin of the deeds of the law|yers to work. Whereby every think may in &s;itch a ca&s;e be made &s;afe and &s;ecure&punc; not forgettin Wenbourne Hill; and the willdurne&s;s, and mayhap the hermuttidge, and the grotto. For why, your noble onnur? Where one fifty thou&s;and pound be a forth cummin from, another may a be|happen to be found. But that's a nether here nor there, a &s;avin and exceptin the death and mortality of man, and the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NO; I will not attempt to con&s;ole my Loui&s;a, for I will not &s;uppo&s;e even at the pre&s;ent moment that &s;he yields to grief, or is in need of con&s;olation. She will not repine at what is not to be reme|died, nor debilitate her mind by dwell|ing
<PB N="10" REF="12">
on her own cau&s;es of di&s;content, in|&s;tead of awakening it to the numerous &s;ources of happine&s;s, which by increa&s;|ing the happine&s;s of others incite it to activity. The&s;e are truths too deeply engraven on the heart of Loui&s;a to be forgotten, and it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to revive them even at this &s;erious mo|ment.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, my friend &s;hall be my judge; my whole conduct &s;hall be &s;ubmitted to her, with an injunction not to indulge any partialities in my fa|vour, but to cen&s;ure, advi&s;e, and in&s;truct me whenever &s;he finds opportunity. Such, Loui&s;a, has been our intercour&s;e; and we have mutual rea&s;on to congratu|late each other on its effects.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t had a conver&s;ation with
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Sir Arthur. He has received a letter from Abimelech, which he &s;hewed me. Of all the proofs Frank has yet given of energy, this relative to his father is per|haps the &s;tronge&s;t. You know the cha|racter of Abimelech. Could you think it po&s;&s;ible? He is willing not only to rai&s;e twenty thou&s;and pounds for Sir Arthur, but to pay down thirty more for his &s;on! He begins to be vain of this &s;on, and has even &s;ome &s;light per|ception that there may be other good qualities be&s;ide that of getting and hoard|ing money.</P>
<P>But his cunning is &s;till predominant. Having conceived the po&s;&s;ibility of this marriage, the accompli&s;hment of it is now become his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and has for a moment &s;ubjected avarice it&s;elf.
<PB N="12" REF="14">
He neglects no motive which he thinks may influence Sir Arthur, not even threatening; though his language is couched in all the art of apparent kind|ne&s;s and adulation. His letter however has produced its effect on my father, as you will perceive by the following dialogue, which was begun by Sir Ar|thur.</P>
<P>What think you of this propo&s;al, Anna?</P>
<P>I ought rather to a&s;k what are your thoughts on the &s;ubject, &s;ir.</P>
<P>I can &s;carcely tell. I own it does not &s;eem to me quite &s;o unrea&s;onable as I &s;hould once have &s;uppo&s;ed it; that is as far as relates to me. But if you &s;hould have conceived any partiality for Mr. Clifton, I &s;hould then&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
Excu&s;e me, &s;ir, for interrupting you, but Mr. Clifton is at pre&s;ent wholly out of the que&s;tion. Were it in my power, which I fear it is not, to do him any &s;er|vice, I &s;hould be as de&s;irous of doing it now as ever; but I can never more think of him as a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Are you &s;o very determined?</P>
<P>I am; and I hope, &s;ir, my determina|tion is not offen&s;ive to you?</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay at pre&s;ent that it is; for not to mention that I think very well of young Mr. Henley, I own the affair of the anonymous letter was a very improper and &s;trange proceeding. Your aunt Wenbourne and Lord Fitz-Allen indeed &s;eem to doubt it; but, according to the account which you and Mr. Henley
<PB N="14" REF="16">
give, I think they have no foundation for their doubts.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Mr. Clifton, with|out the letter, would have been quite &s;ufficient to have fixed my determina|tion.</P>
<P>What behaviour?</P>
<P>The proof he gave of deceit and de|pravity of principle, by the manner in which he endeavoured to &s;educe me.</P>
<P>When was that?</P>
<P>The very day on which Frank ar|rived.</P>
<P>Endeavoured to &s;educe you?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>Are you certain of the truth of what you &s;ay?</P>
<P>He proceeded too far, and explained him&s;elf too openly for me to be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
Seduce you!&mdash;Then you have en|tirely given up all thoughts of him?</P>
<P>All thoughts of marrying him I have mo&s;t certainly.</P>
<P>And what is your opinion of Mr. Henley?</P>
<P>What can it be, &s;ir? Are there two opinions concerning him? And if I were blind to his virtues, for who&s;e &s;afety he has been &s;o often and &s;o ardently ac|tive, who &s;hould do him ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>I own, Anna, I have often thought you had &s;ome love for him, and I am tempt|ed to think &s;o &s;till.</P>
<P>Love in the &s;en&s;e in which you un|der&s;tand it I have carefully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e till now I &s;uppo&s;ed it incompa|tible with duty and virtue; but I ac|knowledge I begin to doubt; and even
<PB N="16" REF="18">
to &s;uppo&s;e that his view of the &s;ubject has been more rational and true than mine; and he thinks it is our duty to form a union, for which he owns he has an ardent wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Yes, he has hone&s;tly told me all that pa&s;&s;ed between you; and his &s;incerity plea&s;ed me&mdash;But every branch of our family would certainly be again&s;t &s;uch a match.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o.</P>
<P>The world too would con&s;ider me as having di&s;honoured my&s;elf, were I to con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I believe it would.</P>
<P>And would exclaim again&s;t the bad example&mdash;What ought to be done?</P>
<P>My opinion has been that the world would have cau&s;e to make this com|plaint;
<PB N="17" REF="19">
but I now think, or rather ima|gine my&s;elf convinced that I was in an error. It appears evident to my mind, at pre&s;ent, that we ought to con&s;ider whether an action be in it&s;elf good or bad, ju&s;t or unju&s;t, and totally to di&s;re|gard both our own prejudices, and the prejudices of the world. Were I to pay fal&s;e homage to wealth and rank, becau&s;e the world tells me it is right that I &s;hould do &s;o, and to neglect ge|nius and virtue, which my judgment tells me would be an odious wrong, I &s;hould find but little &s;atisfaction in the applau&s;e of the world, oppo&s;ed to &s;elf|condemnation.</P>
<P>Mr. Henley is a very good young man; a very good young man indeed; and I believe I &s;hould even be willing to
<PB N="18" REF="20">
think of him for a &s;on, if it &s;hould not be oppo&s;ed by the other branches of the family.</P>
<P>But that it &s;urely will.</P>
<P>I am afraid &s;o&mdash;Lord Fitz-Allen is half reconciled to us again, and I would avoid breaking with him if po&s;&s;ible. Your aunt has a good opinion of Mr. Henley.</P>
<P>But a better of Mr. Clifton.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e. I mu&s;t talk to Edward. Mr. Henley has been his friend.</P>
<P>But Edward does not under&s;tand friend&s;hip. When he &s;ays friend he means acquaintance; and he finds him the mo&s;t agreeable acquaintance, who tells him lea&s;t truth; which certainly is not Mr. Henley. I have ob&s;erved him
<PB N="19" REF="21">
lately to be rather fond of the company of Mr. Clifton, whom he thinks a bet|ter companion.</P>
<P>I own Mr. Henley is very ob&s;tinate in his opinions.</P>
<P>If his opinions be true, would you not have him per&s;i&s;t in the truth.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould he be more certain that what he &s;ays is truth than other people?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he has examined with more indu&s;try and caution, has a &s;tronger mind, and a greater love of enquiry. He does not endeavour to make his principles accord with his practice, but regulates his practice by his principles.</P>
<P>But &s;till I a&s;k what proof he has of being more in the right than other peo|ple?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
I wonder, &s;ir, that you can put &s;uch a que&s;tion! He has &s;urely given both you and me &s;ufficient proofs of &s;uperiority; and though you &s;hould doubt the argu|ments you cannot doubt the facts.</P>
<P>I own he is a very extraordinary young gentleman.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;ir! The word gentleman &s;hews the bent of your thoughts. Can you not perceive it is a word without a meaning? Or, if it have a meaning, that he who is the be&s;t man is the mo&s;t a gentleman?</P>
<P>I know your notions, child, and mine differ a little on the&s;e matters. How|ever I do not think you quite &s;o much in the wrong as I u&s;ed to do; and per|haps there is &s;omething in what you &s;ay. Many men of low fortunes have made their way to the highe&s;t honours; and
<PB N="21" REF="23">
for what I know he may do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>He may and certainly will de&s;erve the highe&s;t re&s;pect: but if you flatter your|&s;elf, &s;ir, that he will &s;eek or accept the titles and di&s;tinctions which men have invented to impo&s;e on each other's folly, and obtain their own artful purpo&s;es, I ought to warn you that you will be mi&s;|taken. His whole life will be devoted to the di&s;covery and &s;preading of truth; and, individual acts of benevolence ex|cepted, his wealth, &s;hould he acquire any, will all be dedicated to that &s;ole ob|ject.</P>
<P>I am afraid the&s;e are &s;trange whims, Anna!</P>
<P>I hope yet to &s;hew you, &s;ir, they are
<PB N="22" REF="24">
noble duties; which it is the exce&s;s of guilt to neglect.</P>
<P>It puzzles me to conceive by what means his father could have become &s;o rich!</P>
<P>He has all his life been rapacious af|ter money. His faculties are &s;trong, but perverted. What would have been wi&s;dom is degenerated into cunning. He has made him&s;elf acquainted with u&s;urers, and they have made him ac|quainted with &s;pendthrifts. He has traded in annuities, and profited by the eagerne&s;s of youth to enjoy: and, &s;ince I mu&s;t be &s;incere, he has encouraged you, &s;ir, to pur&s;ue plans of expence with a view &s;olely to his own profit.</P>
<P>Well, well; &s;hould this marriage
<PB N="23" REF="25">
take place, it will all return into the fa|mily.</P>
<P>That &s;hould be no motive, &s;ir, with either you or me.</P>
<P>I do not know that. You under&s;tand your own rea&s;ons, and I mine; and if they &s;hould but an&s;wer the &s;ame end there will be no harm.</P>
<P>I was going to reply, but Sir Arthur left me; being unwilling to hear argu|ments which he took it for granted he &s;hould not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Frank came in &s;oon after, and I re|peated to him what had been &s;aid. Lou|i&s;a, I mu&s;t tell you the truth and the whole truth. Since I have begun to imagine I might indulge my thoughts in dwelling on&punc;his exalted qualities and un|common
<PB N="24" REF="26">
virtues, my affection for them has greatly increa&s;ed: and they never appeared to me more lovely than in the &s;truggles and checks which his joy re|ceived, at the hope of our union, by the recollection of the lo&s;s of Mr. Clifton. He like me is a&s;toni&s;hed at the powers of your brother's mind, and at their perver&s;ion; and he fears that this at|tempt, having failed, will but &s;erve to render that perver&s;ion more obdurate, nay perhaps more active. He &s;eems even to dread le&s;t I am not &s;ecure; which his de&s;ire to guard and caution me again&s;t would not &s;uffer him to repre&s;s or conceal. His tenderne&s;s and ec&s;ta&s;y, and indeed, Loui&s;a, they were both very &s;trong, were mingled with regret equally
<PB N="25" REF="27">
vivid: and Mr. Clifton! Mr. Clifton! repeatedly bur&s;t from him.</P>
<P>While I was relating what had pa&s;&s;ed between me and Sir Arthur to Frank, and now again &s;ince I have been writing it to you, I accu&s;ed my&s;elf of coldne&s;s, and of &s;hrinking from or rather of half delivering the truth, le&s;t Sir Arthur &s;hould think me a forward girl, or le&s;t I &s;hould think my&s;elf capable of too &s;ud|den a change. But of the degree of that change do you, my friend, judge. I have at all times endeavoured to &s;hew you my naked heart, and often have vio|lently &s;truggled again&s;t every di&s;gui&s;e. I never concealed from my&s;elf that I thought more highly of Frank Henley than of Mr. Clifton; but I imagined principle taught me to prefer what prin|ciple
<PB N="26" REF="28">
now warns me to &s;hun. I am more and more convinced of the error of marrying a bad man in order to make him good. I was not entirely ignorant of this before, and therefore flattered my&s;elf the good might be effected pre|vious to marriage. I forgot, when pa&s;|&s;ion has a purpo&s;e to obtain, how artful it is in concealment.</P>
<P>I have another quarrel with my&s;elf, for having been &s;o de&s;irous of proving to my own conviction that the world's pre|judices and the prejudices of my family ought to be re&s;pected, while that opinion accorded with my practice; and of be|ing now &s;o equally alert to prove the re|ver&s;e. Such are the deceptions which the mind puts upon it&s;elf! For indeed I have been very de&s;irous of acting with
<PB N="27" REF="29">
&s;incerity in both in&s;tances. I can only &s;ay that I feel more certain at pre&s;ent; for before I had doubts, and now I have none. If you &s;u&s;pect me to be influ|enced by inclination, tell me &s;o without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>All good be with my friend! May &s;he profit by my mi&s;takes!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ro&s;e-Bank.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will perceive, Fairfax, I have changed the &s;cene, and am now in the country. I have a long narrative to de|tail, and am &s;itting in an old hall with gloom and lei&s;ure enough to make it as tedious and as dull as you could wi&s;h. My poor mother has taken her la&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="31">
leave of us, and lies now a corp&s;e in the room under me. I could be me|lancholy, or mad, or I know not what&mdash;But 'tis no matter&mdash;She brought me here una&s;ked to make the journey of this world, and now I am obliged to jog on. Not that I think I &s;hould much care if it were &s;hortened, nor how &s;oon; except that I would live to have my revenge; and that I will have, little troubling my&s;elf though the next minute were certain to be my la&s;t. It rankles at my heart, and lies there corroding, biting, fe&s;tering, night and day.</P>
<P>I have quarrelled with my &s;i&s;ter, and I am &s;ure &s;hall never forgive her; nor will &s;he forgive me, &s;o that we &s;hall ea&s;ily balance our accounts. This Anna St. Ives is her &s;upreme favourite. But
<PB N="30" REF="32">
no wonder&mdash;No wonder&mdash;It would be &s;trange if &s;he were not! Still to be &s;o ready to give up a brother, and write me &s;uch a letter as &s;he did on the death of my mother! If I do not make her repent it Heaven renounce me!</P>
<P>But I con&s;ider the whole world as my enemies at this moment; you per|haps, Fairfax, excepted. I &s;ay per|haps, for I do not know how &s;oon you may turn upon and yelp at me with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Fairfax. I am all ve|nom, all viper, and cannot forbear to hi&s;s even at my friend. But let my enemies beware! They &s;hall find I can &s;ting!&mdash;The&s;e cur&s;ed gnawings of heart will not let me begin my &s;tory.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="33">
<P>I told you I was determined to deny the anonymous letter. I have been very indu&s;trious with uncle Fitz-Allen and aunt Wenbourne; and have been equally careful to titilate the vanity of the coxcomb Edward, who is highly flattered with the attention I have paid him, and will I am certain become my warm parti&s;an.</P>
<P>They had all heard the &s;tory, but were all ready enough to gape and &s;wallow my tale; which con&s;idering it was wholly invention was not ill com|po&s;ed. I begin to hate my&s;elf, to hate her, to hate the whole world, for being obliged to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a damned ex|pedient. But I will not recede. I will
<PB N="32" REF="34">
have my revenge! Were the devil him&s;elf waiting to devour me I would on; or were he engaged again&s;t me, I would over-reach him!</P>
<P>I concerted my mea&s;ures, and learn|ing that this lad of mine, who wrote the letter for me, was down at Wenbourne-Hill, I &s;ent my man to inveigle him to come to me, at an inn where I purpo&s;ely &s;topped, in my way to Ro&s;e-Bank. How dur&s;t they &s;uborn my &s;ervant?&mdash;But&mdash;! I will &s;tab and not cur&s;e!</P>
<P>My valet executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and prevailed on the lad to come; though with &s;ome difficulty, for he is a &s;tubborn dog; and had not the valet followed my directions, and told him it was to do his old ma&s;ter a &s;ervice, he would have been foiled. But I took

him up at Paris, de&s;titute and in &s;ome danger of &s;tarving, which he has not forgotten.</P>
<P>This Henley however is a greater fa|vourite with him than I am; as I &s;oon found by his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I began by &s;ounding him, to try if it were po&s;&s;ible to prevail on him to a&s;&s;ert he had written the letter at the in&s;tiga|tion of Henley, in&s;tead of me; but I &s;oon found it was in vain, and dur&s;t not proceed to let him &s;ee my drift.</P>
<P>I then per&s;uaded him that they had totally mi&s;taken my purpo&s;e in writing the letter; that I had done it with a very friendly de&s;ign; that I had my&s;elf a very great e&s;teem for Henley, and that I meant nothing but good to Anna; but that there were &s;ome rea&s;ons, which I
<PB N="34" REF="36">
could not explain to him, that had oc|ca&s;ioned me to write the letter.</P>
<P>As my next purpo&s;e, after that of making him an evidence in my favour, was to &s;end him entirely out of the way, if I failed in the fir&s;t attempt, I began to remind him of the condition in which I had found him in Paris, which he was ready enough to acknowledge, and &s;eem|ed indeed afraid of acting ungratefully. I prompted and &s;trengthened his fears, and at la&s;t told him that, &s;ince I found he was a good lad and meant well, though he was mi&s;taken and had done me an injury, I would give him an opportunity of &s;hewing his gratitude.</P>
<P>I then pretended that I had a packet of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to be deli|vered to my friend in Paris; meaning
<PB N="35" REF="37">
you, Fairfax; which I dur&s;t not tru&s;t to any but a &s;ure hand: and as I knew him to be an hone&s;t lad, I expected he would not refu&s;e to &s;et off with it immediately. It was an affair almo&s;t of life and death! And, that I might impre&s;s his mind with ideas which would a&s;&s;ociate and beget &s;uitable images, I began to talk of the decea&s;e of my mother, of my own af|fliction at the mi&s;under&s;tanding with Anna, of my very great friend&s;hip for Henley, and of the fatal con&s;equences that would attend the mi&s;carriage of the packet.</P>
<P>Still I found him reluctant. He &s;eemed half to &s;u&s;pect me; and yet I made a very clever tale of it. He talked of Henley and his aunt; and he had likewi&s;e a dread of Paris. His aunt I find has
<PB N="36" REF="38">
been maintained by Henley, &s;he being lame and di&s;abled; and as &s;ending him out of the way was a preliminary &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, I gave him a thirty pound bank-note, de&s;ired him to go to his aunt and give her ten pounds, and to keep the re&s;t to &s;ecure him again&s;t any accidents, of which he &s;eemed afraid, in a &s;trange country; with a promi&s;e that he &s;hould have as much more, if he performed his commi&s;&s;ion faithfully, on his return.</P>
<P>I further enquired the direction of the aunt, telling him I would undertake to provide for her: and &s;o I mu&s;t, for &s;he too mu&s;t be &s;ent out of the way.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, by repeating my profe&s;&s;ions and again reminding him of my taking him up at Paris, I was &s;ucce&s;sful.
<PB N="37" REF="39">
Though I had more trouble in gaining the compliance of this lout than would have been &s;ufficient, were I prime mi|ni&s;ter, and did I bribe with any thing like the &s;ame comparative liberality, to gain ten worthy members of parliament, though five knights of the &s;hire had been of the number.</P>
<P>He wanted to return to Wenbourne-Hill for his nece&s;&s;aries and trifling pro|perty; and this reminded me not only of the danger of doing that but of his pa&s;|&s;ing through London. Accordingly I told him to keep the ten pounds meant for his aunt to buy him&s;elf what things he wanted, which I promi&s;ed to replace to her, and informed him I now recol|lected that he mu&s;t take the neare&s;t road to Dover, which I pretended lay through
<PB N="38" REF="40">
Guildford, Bletchingly, and Tunbridge, leaving London on the left.</P>
<P>The importance, hurry and command I a&s;&s;umed did not give him time to re|flect; and the injunctions I gave were &s;uch as I do not imagine he would have di&s;obeyed. But for my own &s;ecu|rity, pretending a fear that he might mi&s;take his way, I &s;ent my valet with him; privately ordering the valet not to part till he &s;aw him &s;afe on board the packet-boat.</P>
<P>And now, Fairfax, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the wi&s;e uncle, who has an excellent &s;cent at di&s;covery and no &s;mall opinion of his own acutene&s;s, may find out that Henley him&s;elf was the forger of this letter; that it was a collu&s;ion between him and the lad, that he has him&s;elf re|moved
<PB N="39" REF="41">
moved both the lad and the aunt, and that his charity is a farce. I &s;ay &s;uch an event is po&s;&s;ible. You may be &s;ure that the idea &s;hall be wholly his own, and that I will allow him all the ju&s;t prai&s;e which he will graciou&s;ly be&s;tow upon his penetration.</P>
<P>My directions to the lad w ere to bring the packet immediately to you; which packet you will find to be blank paper, for I had no time for any thing more, except a &s;hort note of which the fol|lowing is a copy.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I was obliged to pretend extreme hurry to the lad, but I gave my valet private in&s;tructions to take him round, and u&s;e as much delay as he conveni|ently could. Meanwhile I will &s;end the letter I am now writing away expre&s;s, that you may be fully prepared; for this is a point of infinite con&s;equence. If you are not in Paris the expre&s;s is to
<PB N="41" REF="43">
follow you; and you will be kind enough to take mea&s;ures that the lad may follow the expre&s;s. He is ordered to wait your commands, which I told him might po&s;&s;ibly detain him a month, or even more; though it might happen that the bu&s;ine&s;s would be tran&s;acted in a week.</P>
<P>Not that I can hope the real bu&s;ine&s;s can now po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o &s;oon fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>You will take care to make your ac|count agree with mine; and circum|&s;tances oblige me to require of you, Fairfax, to conde&s;cend to get the lad's favour, and not make his &s;tay irk&s;ome. You may command me to ten times this amount, as you know.</P>
<P>This is a melancholy &s;cene, and a
<PB N="42" REF="44">
gloomy hou&s;e, and a di&s;mal country; and I my&s;elf am fretful, and moody, and mad, and mi&s;erable. I &s;hall &s;oon get into action, and then it will wear off.</P>
<P>I will have her; ay, by the infernals will I! And on my own terms. I know &s;he is rejoicing now in her Hen|ley. Eternal cur&s;es bite him! But I will haunt her! I will appear to her in her dreams, and her waking hours &s;hall not want a glimp&s;e of me. I know &s;he hates me. So be it! If &s;he did not I could not &s;o readily dige&s;t my venge|ance. But I know &s;he does! And &s;he &s;hall have better cau&s;e! I never yet &s;ubmitted to be thus baffled. She is preparing an imaginary banquet, and I

will be there a real gue&s;t. I will meet her at Philippi!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I were away from this place! I wi&s;h I were in my mother's coffin!</P>
<P>I hate to meet this in&s;olent &s;i&s;ter of mine. We have had a battle, and I was in &s;uch a frantic rage that I could neither find ideas nor words; while &s;he was cool, cutting, in&s;olent, impudent&mdash;! I never in my life had &s;o &s;trong an inclination to wring a hu&s;&s;ey's neck round.</P>
<P>But I will get away as fa&s;t as I can. I am re&s;olved however to turn her out of the hou&s;e fir&s;t. She &s;hall feel me too, before I have done. Brother with her is no tie, nor &s;hall &s;i&s;ter be to me. Her mother has made but a &s;mall pro|vi&s;ion
<PB N="44" REF="46">
for her, and has recommended her to my mercy. She had better have taught her a little humility&mdash;</P>
<P>Plagues and pe&s;tilence! Why do I worry my&s;elf about her? I have quite cau&s;es enough of di&s;traction without that. I mu&s;t not turn her out of doors neither, now I remember. If I did &s;he would fly to her friend, and would make her if po&s;&s;ible as great a fury as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why do I &s;ay would make? Do I not know that I am her abhorrence? I loved her, Fairfax, better than ever I loved woman; and would have loved her more, have loved her entirely, in|finitely, heart and &s;oul, if &s;he had not wronged me. From the fir&s;t I was overlooked by her, catechi&s;ed, repri|manded,

treated like a poor ignoramus; while her Henley&mdash;! If I write any more I &s;hall go mad!&mdash;Da&s;h through the window, or do &s;ome de&s;perate act!&mdash;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">SIR ARTHUR ST. IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. HENLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SIR, I have received your letter, which I mu&s;t acknowledge is far more &s;atisfactory and in a more proper &s;tyle than your la&s;t, at which I cannot but own I was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to your &s;on, I mu&s;t &s;ay
<PB N="47" REF="49">
that he is a young gentleman of very great merit; and though a marriage into the family of St. Ives is a thing that he certainly has no right to expect, yet I cannot deny that your propo&s;al de|&s;erves &s;ome con&s;ideration; ina&s;much as you now come forward like a man, and have likewi&s;e a recollection of pro|priety.</P>
<P>Neither do I forget, good &s;ir, what you have hinted concerning Wenbourne-Hill, which is far from di&s;agreeable to me. And though there are many im|pediments, for which I cannot altogether an&s;wer ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, yet I think it very probable that this affair &s;hould end in &s;omething like the manner you de&s;ire. I accordingly expect, Mr. Henley, you
<PB N="48" REF="50">
will have the kindne&s;s to &s;top proceed|ings relative to the foreclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>In return for which I a&s;&s;ure you, on my honour, I will do every thing that becomes a gentleman to bring the affair to a proper conclu&s;ion. And as I have a very great re&s;pect for your &s;on, and think very highly of his parts, and learning, and all that, I find when things come to be con&s;idered that he perhaps may make my daughter more happy, and the match may have other greater conveniences than perhaps one that might &s;eem to the other branches of my family more &s;uitable.</P>
<P>But I know that for the pre&s;ent it will be oppo&s;ed by Lord Fitz-Allen; and though I do not think proper to
<PB N="49" REF="51">
be governed by him or any man, yet I could rather wi&s;h not to come to an open rupture with &s;o near a rela|tion.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be thought deroga|tory by &s;ome other branches of the family. But my daughter has a very high opinion of the good qualities of your &s;on; and &s;he reminds me con|tinually that he has done us many &s;ignal &s;ervices, which I a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. Henley, I am very willing to re|member.</P>
<P>When things &s;hall be in a proper train, I imagine it will be our be&s;t way of proceeding to pay off all mortgages on Wenbourne-Hill, to|gether with the &s;um for the docking of the entail to my &s;on Edward, and
<PB N="50" REF="52">
to &s;ettle the e&s;tate in rever&s;ion on our children and their i&s;&s;ue; my rental being made &s;ubject to the payment of legal intere&s;t to your &s;on for the fifty thou&s;and pounds. But we will con&s;ider further on the&s;e things when matters are ripe.</P>
<P>In the mean time, be plea&s;ed to &s;end me up one thou&s;and pounds for pre&s;ent current expences, which you will place to account. And now I hope, good &s;ir, we &s;hall from this time be upon proper terms: in expectation of which I re|main with all friendly intentions,</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OH that I could write to my Loui&s;a as formerly, with flattering and gene|rous hopes in favour of a brother! Would it were po&s;&s;ible! I am already weary of accu&s;ation, though I fear this is but its beginning. I cannot help it, but I have &s;trong apprehen&s;ions. Not
<PB N="52" REF="54">
that I will be the &s;lave of fear, or &s;ink before danger &s;hould it happen to come.</P>
<P>The lad that copied the anonymous letter has left Wenbourne-Hill! Is run away! No one knows whither! He went the very day on which your brother left London, to be pre&s;ent with you at Mrs. Clifton's funeral; and Clifton now denies, with pretended in|dignation, having had any knowledge whatever of this letter!&mdash;Oh how auda|cious is he in error! Had the &s;ame energy but a worthy object, how excel|lent would be its effects!</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange circum&s;tance! And what is more &s;trange and indeed alarm|ing, Frank has been to enquire for the lad's aunt, and &s;he is gone! No one
<PB N="53" REF="55">
can tell what is become of her, except that &s;he went away in a hackney-coach, after having as the people &s;uppo&s;e re|ceived a pre&s;ent; becau&s;e &s;he di&s;charged all her little debts contracted during the ab&s;ence of Frank, and bought her&s;elf &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>What can this &s;udden and unac|countable removal of the&s;e two people mean? They had both apparently the &s;tronge&s;t motives to the contrary; and Frank has a very good opinion of the lad, and not a bad one of the aunt.</P>
<P>This is not all. We were ye&s;terday invited to dine with Lord Fitz-Allen; that is I and Sir Arthur, not Frank Henley, as you will &s;uppo&s;e. I had a di&s;like to the vi&s;it, though I did not
<PB N="54" REF="56">
&s;u&s;pect it would have been half &s;o di&s;a|greeable. My brother and my aunt Wenbourne were likewi&s;e invited; we found them there.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the &s;cene with Mr. Clifton I have been con&s;tantly denied to him, and po&s;itively refu&s;ed all his applications for an interview; conceiving it to be ju&s;t not to let him imagine there was any doubt on my mind, relative to his proceedings and their motives. We had &s;carcely &s;at down to table before he came in, as if by accident. This was a &s;ubterfuge. To what will not error and the abandonment of the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ubmit?</P>
<P>After apologies for dropping in and di&s;turbing &s;o much good company, and a repetition of&mdash;I am very glad to &s;ee
<PB N="55" REF="57" MS="y">
you, &s;ir; you do my table honour, and other like marked compliments from Lord Fitz-Allen, Clifton &s;eated him&s;elf and endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume his former gaiety and humour. But it could not be&mdash;His heart was too ill at ea&s;e. His eye was continually glancing toward me, and there as often met that &s;teady regard which he knew not how to &s;upport, and by which he was as continually di&s;con|certed. I did not affect to frown, and to &s;mile would have been guilt. I put no reproof into my look, except the open-eyed &s;obriety of fortitude, &s;pring|ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of right. But this was in&s;upportable. He talked fa&s;t, for he wanted to talk away his &s;en&s;ations, as well as to convince his ob&s;ervers that he was quite at his ea&s;e. I know not
<PB N="56" REF="58">
how far he was &s;ucce&s;sful, for they laughed as much when he failed, or more perhaps, than they would have done had his wit pre&s;erved its u&s;ual brilliancy. His manner told them he intended to be jocular, and that was their cue to join chorus.</P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Allen was very marked in his attentions to him, which were re|turned with no le&s;s ardour. Clifton in|deed evidently laid him&s;elf out to plea&s;e the whole table; but me lea&s;t, becau&s;e with me he had lea&s;t hope; and becau&s;e he found his efforts produced no altera|tion in that uniform &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s on which I had determined.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the de&s;&s;ert was &s;erved up the &s;ervants withdrew, and not one of them afterward came in till rung for;
<PB N="57" REF="59">
which I imagine had been preconcerted. Looks then became more grave, and the conver&s;ation &s;oon dwindled into &s;i|lence. At la&s;t Lord Fitz-Allen, after various hems and efforts, for he has &s;ome fear of me, or rather of what he &s;uppo&s;es the derogatory &s;ufferance of contradiction, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to hear, niece, there is a mi&s;under&s;tanding between you and Mr. Clifton; and as you happen now to be both together, I think it is a proper opportunity for explanation. You know, Mi&s;s St. Ives, that an alliance with the family of Clifton has always met my approbation; and I &s;uppo&s;e you will not deny me the favour of li&s;tening with patience&mdash;Why don't you &s;peak, niece?</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">
You de&s;ired me to li&s;ten, &s;ir, and I am &s;ilent&mdash;Let Mr. Clifton proceed.</P>
<P>Clifton after &s;ome &s;tammering he&s;ita|tion began&mdash;I know, madam, you have been prejudiced again&s;t me, and have been told very &s;trange things; very un|accountable things. I cannot tell what an&s;wer to make, till I know perfectly of what I am accu&s;ed. All I reque&s;t is to be &s;uffered to face my accu&s;ers, and let Lord Fitz-Allen, or Sir Arthur, or this good lady [My aunt Wenbourne] or your brother, nay or your&s;elf, though you think &s;o ill of me, be my judge. I am told &s;omething of an anonymous letter; I know not very well what; but if any good evidence can be brought of my having written, or cau&s;ed to be written, or had any concern whatever in
<PB N="59" REF="61">
the writing of &s;uch a letter, I &s;olemnly pledge my&s;elf to renounce the ble&s;&s;ing I &s;o ardently &s;eek without a murmur.</P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Allen exclaimed nothing could be more gentleman-like. My aunt Wenbourne owned it was a very proper propo&s;al. Edward thought there could be no objection to it. Sir Arthur was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>His in&s;idious appeal to ju&s;tice, and be|ing brought face to face with his ac|cu&s;ers, revived the full picture of the flight of the lad, the removal of the aunt, and the whole chain of craft and fal&s;ehood connected with the&s;e circum|&s;tances. It was with difficulty I re|pre&s;&s;ed feelings that were &s;truggling into indignation&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr. Clifton.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62">
Then, &s;ir, you coolly and deliberately deny all knowledge of the letter in que&s;|tion?</P>
<P>I have told you, madam, that I will &s;uffer Lord Fitz-Allen, your&s;elf, any per&s;on to pa&s;s &s;entence, after having ex|amined witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>An&s;wer me in an open direct manner, Mr. Clifton, without ambiguity. Were you not the author of that letter?</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, madam, to &s;ee you &s;o de|&s;irous to find me guilty; and I would even criminate my&s;elf to give you plea|&s;ure, but that I know I mu&s;t then nei|ther hope for your favour nor the coun|tenance of this good company. I a&s;&s;ure you, Lord Fitz-Allen, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir Arthur, and you, madam, and all, upon
<PB N="61" REF="63">
my honour I am incapable of what is at|tributed to me.</P>
<P>Do not appeal to my uncle and aunt, Mr. Clifton, but turn this way. Let your eyes be fixed here. Li&s;ten while I read the letter; and then, without once &s;hrinking from your&s;elf, or me, repeat as you have done, though in an equivo|cal manner, upon your honour you are not the author.</P>
<P>I took the letter from my pocket and began to read. When I came to the following pa&s;&s;age I again repeated&mdash;Look at me, Mr. Clifton&mdash;<Q>She will never have the man they mean for her, I can a&s;&s;ure you of that; and what is more, he will never have her.</Q> I proceeded to the end, and then add|ed&mdash;Once more, Mr. Clifton, look at
<PB N="62" REF="64">
me and repeat&mdash;Upon my honour I was not the inventor and author of tho&s;e words.</P>
<P>Louifa&mdash;! He did look&mdash;! I hope I never &s;hall &s;ee man look &s;o again!&mdash;He &s;tared and forced his eyes to do their office, and repeated&mdash;<Q>Upon my ho|nour I was not the inventor and au|thor of tho&s;e words.</Q>&mdash;He &s;tabbed me to the heart, Loui&s;a!&mdash;Can he do this?&mdash;Then what can he not do? He even felt a complacency at the victory he had obtained, and turning round to Lord Fitz-Allen and the company again repeated&mdash;<Q>Upon my honour I am not the inventor and author of tho&s;e words.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Allen almo&s;t crowed with exultation. I am mi&s;taken, niece, &s;aid
<PB N="63" REF="65">
he, if you do not find there are other people who can write anonymous letters: people of no honour; up&s;tarts, mon|grels, mu&s;hrooms, low contemptible fel|lows, that would fully the mouth of a Fitz-Allen to mention.</P>
<P>The tone of this lordly uncle was &s;o high, Loui&s;a, and his pa&s;&s;ions &s;o arro|gant, loud, and ob&s;tinate, that it was with difficulty I could recover the forti|tude requi&s;ite to a&s;&s;ert truth and put fal&s;e|hood to the blu&s;h. I again turned to my opponent.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton, I feel at pre&s;ent you are a dangerous man. But I do not fear you. Ob&s;erve, &s;ir, I do not fear you&mdash;[I turned to my uncle] Sir, Mr. Clifton cau&s;ed this letter to be written. But, if there were no &s;uch letter in exi&s;tence, I
<PB N="64" REF="66">
have another proof, &s;tronger, more un|deniable, of which I imagine you will not doubt when I inform you that no third per&s;on was concerned. It was ad|dre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf. It was a &s;trenuous, bold, unprincipled effort to &s;educe me. Let the gentleman again look me in the face and tell me I am guilty of fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>I &s;poke with firmne&s;s, and Lord Fitz-Allen's features relaxed, and his eye be|gan to enquire with pain and apprehen|&s;ion. His great fear was of being con|victed of want of penetration. Clifton perceived the feelings of the company turn upon him with &s;u&s;picion; but his art, mu&s;t I add? his hypocri&s;y did not fail him. He transformed the confu|&s;ion he felt into a look of contrition, and
<PB N="65" REF="67">
with as much ardour as if it had been real replied&mdash;</P>
<P>It is that fatal error which has ruined me, madam, in your good opinion, and has occa&s;ioned you to credit every accu|&s;ation again&s;t me, however improbable. I confe&s;s my guilt. Not guilt of heart, madam; for honour be my witne&s;s, my views were as pure as the words in which they were uttered. I was at that time dependant on the will of a mother, whom I loved, and who&s;e memory I revere. My pa&s;&s;ions were impatient, and I wi&s;hed to remove impediments to my happine&s;s which now no longer exi&s;t. I do not pretend to palliate what is un|pardonable, and what I my&s;elf con|demn as &s;everely as you do; except that I abjure all di&s;h&oacute;nourable intentions, and
<PB N="66" REF="68">
meant as I &s;aid to be your hu&s;band. The &s;tronge&s;t proof I can give that this was my meaning I now offer, in the pre&s;ence of this noble and good company. I re|quire no conditions, I a&s;k for no fortune except your&s;elf, which is the only ble&s;|&s;ing I covet in this life. I will joyfully attend you to the altar whenever you and your worthy relations &s;hall con&s;ent; next week, to-morrow, to-day, this mo|ment; and &s;hould think my&s;elf the mo&s;t favoured, the mo&s;t happy man on earth!</P>
<P>The offer is the offer of a gentleman, Sir Arthur, &s;aid Lord Fitz-Allen. If Mr. Clifton had been guilty of any inde|corum, niece, [Turning to me] you could not require more honourable amends. This is acting with that dig|nity
<PB N="67" REF="69">
which characterizes a man of family, Mrs. Wenbourne; and as it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for Mi&s;s St. Ives to &s;ee it in any other point of view, here the affair will na|turally end, and there is no more to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>I immediately an&s;wered&mdash;If, &s;ir, by the affair ending here, you under&s;tand any further intercour&s;e between me and Mr. Clifton, I mu&s;t not &s;uffer you to continue in &s;uch an error. We are and ever mu&s;t remain &s;eparate. Habit and education have made us two &s;uch dif|ferent beings, that it would be the ex|ce&s;s of folly to &s;uppo&s;e marriage could make us one.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s St. Ives&mdash;[My uncle collected all his ideas of rank and grandeur] Mi&s;s St. Ives, you mu&s;t do me the honour to
<PB N="68" REF="70">
con&s;ider me as the head of our family, and &s;uffer me to remind you of the re|&s;pect and obedience which are due to that head. The propo&s;al now made you I approve. It is made by a man of family, and I mu&s;t take the liberty to lay my injunctions upon you to li&s;ten to it in a decorous and proper manner.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered&mdash;I am &s;orry, &s;ir, that our ideas of propriety are &s;o very oppo&s;ite. But whether my judgment be right or wrong, as I am the per&s;on to be married to Mr. Clifton, and not your Lord&s;hip, my judgment as well as yours mu&s;t and ought to be con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Allen could &s;carcely re|&s;train his anger within the bounds of his own decorum. He bur&s;t into exclama|tions&mdash;Exceedingly well, mi&s;s!&mdash;Very
<PB N="69" REF="71">
proper behaviour to a per&s;on of my rank, and your uncle!&mdash;You hear, Sir Arthur!&mdash;You hear, Mrs. Wenbourne! You all hear!&mdash;But your motives and inclinations are known, mi&s;s: I am &s;orry that it would di&s;honour the tongue of Fitz-Allen to repeat them: and I can|not help telling you, Sir Arthur, that you have been exceedingly to blame to admit &s;uch a fellow to any familiarity with a woman of rank and my niece; a fellow better entitled to be her footman than her&mdash;I will not permit the word to pa&s;s my lips.</P>
<P>I felt the cowardice of &s;uffering worth and virtue to be in&s;ulted without a de|fender, from the fear that I my&s;elf &s;hould be involved in the in&s;ult, and re|plied&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">
The gentleman, &s;ir, to whom you have twice alluded in terms of &s;o much contempt, were he pre&s;ent would &s;mile at your mi&s;take. But there are more peo|ple at this table than my&s;elf who have been witne&s;&s;es how little he de&s;erves to be &s;poken of in the language of oppro|brium.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton appeared eager to be the fir&s;t to acknowledge Mr. Henley was a very worthy per&s;on. Edward muttered &s;omething to the &s;ame tune; and Sir Ar|thur &s;eemed very willing to have &s;poken out, but wanted the courage. He began at Turnham Green, but could get no further. Lord Fitz-Allen an&s;wered&mdash;</P>
<P>What tell you me of Turnham-Green, Sir Arthur? I was &s;topped once my&s;elf, by a highwayman, and my foot|man
<PB N="71" REF="73">
fired at him, and &s;ent him packing; but I did not for that rea&s;on come home and marry my footman to my daugh|ter.</P>
<P>The full image of Frank and his vir|tues pervaded my mind, my heart &s;well|ed, my thoughts bur&s;t from my lips, and I exclaimed&mdash;Oh, &s;ir, that you had a thou&s;and daughters, and that each of them were worthy of &s;uch a footman for a hu&s;band!</P>
<P>Had you beheld this uncle of mine, Loui&s;a!&mdash;The daughters of the peer Fitz-Allen married to footmen! The in&s;ult was almo&s;t agony. The only an|tidote to the pain which his countenance excited was the ab&s;urdity and ridicule of the prejudice. But I perceived how vain it was to expect that in this com|pany
<PB N="72" REF="74">
the voice of ju&s;tice &s;hould be heard, and I ro&s;e. My aunt ro&s;e at the &s;ame time, to retire with me; but, recol|lecting my&s;elf, I turned and thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed Lord Fitz-Allen and Mr. Clif|ton, alternately:</P>
<P>That I may not be liable to any ju&s;t blame from your lord&s;hip, or you, &s;ir, for want of being explicit, you mu&s;t permit me to repeat&mdash;I never will again admit of the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Clifton. I have an abhorrence of the errors in which he is now indulging. He him|&s;elf has told me what a mad and vicious act it would be to marry a hu&s;band in whom I could not confide, and I never can confide in him. My per&s;ua&s;ion at this moment of his hypocri&s;y is &s;uch that, could I prevail on my&s;elf to the de|ba&s;ement
<PB N="73" REF="75">
of putting him to the trial, by pretending to accept his hand, I am con|vinced he would refu&s;e. I read his heart. He &s;eeks an opportunity to re|venge imaginary injuries; for I never did, do not, nor ever can wi&s;h him any thing but good. I think I would lay down my life, without he&s;itation, to ren|der him all of which his uncommon powers are capable: but I perceive the impo&s;&s;ibility of its being effected by me, and I here ultimately and determinedly renounce all thought of him, or of &s;o dangerous an attempt.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton eagerly &s;tarted up, and with a momentary &s;oftening of counte|nance, a pleading voice, and &s;omething like the tone of returning virtue ex|claimed&mdash;Hear me, madam!&mdash;I con|jure
<PB N="74" REF="76">
you, hear me! My appeal is to the benevolence, the dignity of your heart! Remember the virtuous plan you had formed&mdash;!</P>
<P>The combat in his mind was violent but &s;hort. Truth made a &s;truggle to gain the ma&s;tery, and hope rai&s;ed up a tran&s;ient pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, which was as quickly overclouded by anger and de|&s;pair, and he &s;topped abruptly. At lea&s;t his voice and features were &s;o impa&s;&s;ion|ed that, if the&s;e were not his &s;en&s;ations, I have no clue to the human heart. Perceiving him pau&s;e and doubt, I re|plied&mdash;</P>
<P>It cannot be, Mr. Clifton! You this moment feel it cannot! You have be|gun a cour&s;e of fraud, and which the whole arrangement of to-day is only
<PB N="75" REF="77">
meant as &s;o much pitiful machinery to effect. You are con&s;cious, Mr. Clifton, you are con&s;cious, Lord Fitz-Allen, that our meeting was not, as you have both pretended, accidental. And I here call upon you&mdash;you, Mr. Clif|ton, to tell for what purpo&s;e or where you have &s;ent the lad who wrote the letter, and to what place you have removed his aunt? Such an artifice is vile, &s;ir! And to challenge your accu&s;ers to &s;tand forward, and with a look &s;uch as you a&s;&s;umed to affirm, <Q>Upon your honour you were not the inventor and author of the letter,</Q> is &s;o much more vile that I &s;hudder for you! Your own proceedings have con|jured up a train of recollections that &s;peak a concerted plan of perfidy. You mean mi&s;chief! But I once more tell
<PB N="76" REF="78">
you, &s;ir, I do not fear you! I will not fear you! My fears indeed are &s;trong, but they are for your&s;elf. Beware! The more guilt you have committed, the more you will be driven to commit. Turn back! You are in a dreadful path! It is unworthy of you, Mr. Clifton! It is unworthy of you!</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly withdrew, and was follow|ed by Mrs. Wenbourne, who began to expre&s;s &s;omething like blame of the po|&s;itive manner in which I had &s;poken, and the high language I had u&s;ed to Lord Fitz-Allen; but it was too feeble to incite an an&s;wer in my then &s;tate of mind. I reque&s;ted &s;he would order her carriage, and &s;et me down. She a&s;ked if I would not fir&s;t pay my re&s;pects to my uncle. I an&s;wered yes, when my un|cle &s;hould be more de&s;erving of re&s;pect.
<PB N="77" REF="79">
She &s;aid I was a &s;trange young lady. I replied I &s;incerely hoped there were many young ladies &s;tranger even than I.</P>
<P>She took offence at the&s;e retorts upon her words, and I perceived that, though the &s;pirit of my an&s;wer was right, the manner was wrong; and explained and apologi&s;ed as became me. She was ap|pea&s;ed, and when the carriage came again a&s;ked if I would not go with her to take leave. I an&s;wered I imagined my uncle would be glad to wave the ce|remony; and, as I thought he had acted very improperly, curt&s;ying and taking leave would but be practi&s;ing the cu&s;|tomary hypocri&s;y of our manners, which I hoped I &s;hould on all occa&s;ions have the firmne&s;s to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Accordingly my aunt went her&s;elf;
<PB N="78" REF="80">
and his lord&s;hip, &s;till pre&s;erving his dig|nity, pretended to forbid me his pre|&s;ence, till I better under&s;tood what was due to the relation&s;hip and rank in which he &s;tood. This my aunt re|ported, and I returned no an&s;wer, but left her to make her own reflections.</P>
<P>Thus ended this painful interview&mdash;Tell me, what ought I to think? What can be the purport of a conduct &s;o very wrong? Such a &s;tring of fal&s;ehoods! How different would the behaviour of Mr. Clifton have been, had not con|&s;cious criminality oppre&s;&s;ed and chained up his faculties! Such per&s;i&s;tence in du|plicity mu&s;t have &s;ome end in view. Could I con&s;ent to marriage, which is now utterly impo&s;&s;ible, he has certainly no &s;uch meaning. If he had he could
<PB N="79" REF="81">
not have written, he could not have act|ed as he has done; and even le&s;s in this la&s;t in&s;tance &s;ince his writing than be|fore, for he could not but know that, though he could appear this generous man of honour to Lord Fitz-Allen, he mu&s;t &s;tand detected by me. It was not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Well! Let him mean me all the harm he plea&s;es; only let me find &s;ome opportunity of convincing him what a depraved, unmanly, trivial turn his mind has taken, and let me but give it a different bent, and I will willingly &s;uffer all he &s;hall have the power to inflict. I do not find my&s;elf, Loui&s;a, di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tand in that dread of ba&s;ene&s;s and vio|lence which they generally in&s;pire. Virtue is not a pa&s;&s;ive but an active
<PB N="80" REF="82">
quality; and its fortitude is much more potent than the ra&s;h vehemence of vice.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Loui&s;a. Peace and feli|city guard you!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Dover Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THANK you, Fairfax, for your &s;peed and precautions, which I mu&s;t re|que&s;t you not to &s;lacken. Do not let the lad e&s;cape you: his appearance here would be ruin. Let but my grand &s;cheme be completed, and then I care
<PB N="82" REF="84">
not though the legions of hell were to ri&s;e, and mow and run a tilt at me. I would face their whole fury. The &s;cene would delight me. Let them come all! I burn to turn upon and rend them! The more de&s;perate the more grateful.</P>
<P>I told you, Fairfax, &s;he hated me! I have it now from her own mouth! She feels I am become her foe! My hand is already upon her! My deepe&s;t darke&s;t thoughts of vengeance do not exceed her imagination.</P>
<P>And yet &s;he fears me not! Her words, her looks, her ge&s;tures are all cool, firm defiance! She is a miracle, Fairfax! A miracle! But I will over|match her. A heroine! She would have unhor&s;ed Orlando him&s;elf, had &s;he
<PB N="83" REF="85">
lived in the times of the knights Pa|ladin.</P>
<P>I am an in&s;ufferable booby, an eternal lunatic, for having fir&s;t thought of quar|relling with her. But it is too late! I might have fore&s;een the advantages I give a woman like her. She openly, magnanimou&s;ly tells me what my in|tents are, and then &s;purns at them. She keeps her anger under indeed, but does not repre&s;s its energy; a proof of the &s;ubjection in which &s;he holds her pa&s;|&s;ions. She once endeavoured to teach me this art, would I but have li&s;tened. But that is pa&s;t!</P>
<P>I could not have thought it was in wo|man! The poor, wailing, watery-eyed beings I had before encountered would not &s;uffer me to &s;uppo&s;e a female could
<PB N="84" REF="86">
po&s;&s;e&s;s the high courage of the daring, noble mind. Never but one &s;hort mo|ment did I overtop her: nor are there any means but tho&s;e I then u&s;ed. In|&s;pire her with the dread of offending what &s;he thinks principle, and &s;he be|comes a coward!</P>
<P>But I will rou&s;e! I will &s;oar above her, will &s;ubdue her, will have her pro&s;|trate in humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or peri&s;h! In the pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es I feel I can|not &s;ucceed; but &s;ingly, face to face, pa&s;&s;ion to pa&s;&s;ion, and being to being, di&s;tinct and eminent as &s;he &s;tands above all woman-kind, I will yet prove to her &s;he is not the equal of the man Clif|ton.</P>
<P>She her&s;elf has even thrown the gauntlet. I have had &s;uch a &s;cene with
<PB N="85" REF="87">
her! A public exhibition! I cannot re|late the manner of it. I dare not tru&s;t my brain with the full remini&s;cence.</P>
<P>Why did I quarrel with her? She meant me well&mdash;Tortures!&mdash;I am a lu|natic to tea&s;e my&s;elf with &s;uch recollec|tions. This is a damned, wrong&punc;head|ed, ignorant, blundering, vile world&punc; and I cannot &s;ee my way in it. I &s;hould have had no &s;u&s;picion that it is all this but for her.</P>
<P>That Henley &s;hall never have her! I'll murder him fir&s;t! Though the bot|tomle&s;s pit were to gape and &s;wallow me, he &s;hall not have her! The con|temptible buzzard, Sir Arthur, is now completely veered about. But in vain! It &s;hall not be! By hell it &s;hall not!</P>
<P>This fellow, this Henley mu&s;t &s;ome
<PB N="86" REF="88">
how or other be di&s;po&s;ed of. The con|tempt of the arrogant peer, her uncle, will harm him but little; for the lord, with all his dignity, is no match for the plebeian.</P>
<P>Neither will his lord&s;hip ha&s;tily &s;eek another combat with his niece. The only advantage I have, in &s;o in&s;ignifi|cant an ally, is that of hereafter making &s;u&s;picion alight on Henley, and not on me; for I mean to carry them both off, Henley and Anna. I know not where or how I &s;hall yet di&s;po&s;e of them, but there is no other mode of accompli&s;hing vengeance. They mu&s;t be confined too. I care not how de&s;perate the means! I will not retract! They &s;hall be taught the danger of rai&s;ing up an enemy like me! I will have them at my feet! Will
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;eparate them! Will glut my revenge, and do the deed that &s;hall prevent their ever meeting more, except perhaps to reproach each other with the madne&s;s of having injured, aggravated, and defied a Clifton!</P>
<P>My whole days are dedicated to this &s;ingle object. I have been riding round the &s;kirts of this &s;hapele&s;s mon&s;ter of a city, on all &s;ides, in &s;earch of lonely te|nantle&s;s hou&s;es; &s;ome two of which I mean to provide with inhabitants. I have met with more than one that are not ill &s;ituated.</P>
<P>But I want agents! De&s;perados! Hungry and old traders in violence! I care not where I go for them; have them I will, though I &s;eek them in the purlieus of infamy and dete&s;tation. To
<PB N="88" REF="90">
&s;ucced by any other means is impo&s;&s;ible. She will not admit me in the &s;ame apart|ment with her&s;elf, nor I believe in the &s;ame world, had &s;he the power to ex|clude me.</P>
<P>I met her indeed at Lord Fitz-Al|len's, where the &s;cene above-mentioned pa&s;&s;ed; but it was a plan concerted with his lord&s;hip, which &s;he ea&s;ily detected, and publicly reproached him with his duplicity. I gloried to hear her; for &s;he had not injured him. A poor com|pound of pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s! Incapa|ble of under&s;tanding the worth of &s;uch a niece! But &s;he made him feel his own in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>Henley and &s;he are now never a&s;un|der. I have mentioned the maid Laura to you. She tells me they have long
<PB N="89" REF="91">
conver&s;ations in the morning, long walks in the afternoon, and at night they have neither of them the power to ri&s;e and &s;eparate. But I will come upon them! My &s;pirit at pre&s;ent is haunting them, never leaves them, girds at and terrifies them at every in&s;tant, during their amo|rous dalliance! I know it does! They cannot get quit of me! I am with them, weighing them down, convul&s;ing them! They feel they are in my gripe!&mdash;Hah! The thought is heart's ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When there is no company, and when Sir Arthur is not &s;itting with them, this maid, Laura, has that honour. Whence it appears that even the&s;e immaculate &s;ouls have &s;ome dread of &s;candal.</P>
<P>And who is it in&s;pires that dread? It is I! They &s;eem to have di&s;covered
<PB N="90" REF="92">
that all circum&s;tances, all incidents wear a double face; and that I am the ma|lignant genius who can make which he plea&s;es the true one&mdash;Yes! I am with them! I &s;end the Incubus that hag|rides them in their dreams! They ga&s;p and would awake, but cannot!</P>
<P>Why could &s;he not have be&s;towed all this affection upon me? Why could &s;he not? I once thought a woman might have loved me!&mdash;But it &s;eems I was mi&s;taken&mdash;The things that go by the general name of woman might; but when I came to woman her&s;elf, &s;he could not, though &s;he tried.</P>
<P>Would I were any where but in this infernal gloom! It is a dete&s;table coun|try! This town is one everla&s;ting fog, and its inhabitants are as cloudy as its
<PB N="91" REF="93">
&s;kies! Every man broods over &s;ome &s;o|litary &s;cheme of his own, avoids human intercour&s;e, and hates to communicate the murk of his mind. I am in a wil|derne&s;s. I fly the herd, and the herd flies me. We pa&s;s and &s;cowl enmity at each other, for I begin to look with ab|horrence on the face of man. There is not a &s;ingle gleam of cheerfulne&s;s around me. The &s;un has not once &s;hone &s;ince the day of my di&s;appointment, which was it&s;elf thick darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Would I could getrid of my&s;elf!&mdash;I am going to take a ride, and make a &s;econd examination of a large lonely hou&s;e be|yond Knight&s;bridge. It lies to the left, and is at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance from the road. I think it will &s;uit my purpo&s;e. I mu&s;t not have far to convey them;
<PB N="92" REF="94">
and Laura informs me their walks are mo&s;t frequently directed through Hyde-Park, and among the fields at the back of Brompton.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be as quiet and appear as lit|tle my&s;elf as po&s;&s;ible; for which rea&s;on I ride without a &s;ervant. And though I have been indu&s;trious in reading adver|ti&s;ements, and getting intelligence of empty hou&s;es, I have not ventured to enquire per&s;onally. Laura attends them in their walks; but &s;he is &s;ecure.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t both be &s;eized at the &s;ame time, and in a manner that &s;hall fru&s;trate all re&s;earch. It will then be concluded they have gone off together. He is a powerful fellow, a dangerous fellow, and I mu&s;t be well provided. He &s;hall ne|ver have her, Fairfax! I would die upon

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ABIMELECH is come up to town. I am obliged very re&s;pectfully to call him Mr. Henley when Sir Ar|thur hears me, in compliance to his feelings: and he has hinted that hereafter, when his name is written, it mu&s;t be tagged with an e&s;quire.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">
The old mi&s;er [Well, Loui&s;a, let it be the old gentleman] is &s;o eager in pur&s;uit of his project that he can take no re&s;t, and is unwilling Sir Arthur &s;hould take any. He has a prodigious quantity of cunning! Whatever he may know of the theory of the pa&s;&s;ions as a general &s;ubject, no per&s;on certainly knows better how to work upon the pa&s;|&s;ions of Sir Arthur: at lea&s;t no per&s;on who will conde&s;cend to take &s;uch an advantage. His di&s;cour&s;e is &s;uch a con|tinued mixture of Wenbourne-Hill, his money, mortgages, grottos, groves, the wherewithals, and the young gentleman his &s;on, that laughter &s;carcely can hold to hear him. Were the thing practica|ble, he would render Frank Henley him|&s;elf ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
It is plea&s;ant to remark what a check the pre&s;ence of this favourite &s;on is upon his loquacity. He never &s;u&s;pects the po&s;&s;ibility of there being a mortal &s;upe|rior to him&s;elf at other times; whereas he has then a latent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own ridicule. The effect which the ab|&s;ence of Frank has produced, with the favour he is in with me, and the re&s;o|lute manner in which he conquered his father when he la&s;t went down to Wen|bourne-Hill, have made a total change in the old man's behaviour to this for|merly neglected but now half adored &s;on. Were habits &s;o inveterate capable of being eradicated, Frank would yet teach him virtue; but the ta&s;k is too difficult.</P>
<P>He is certainly in a mo&s;t delicious
<PB N="98" REF="100">
trance. His &s;on to be married to the daughter of his ma&s;ter! That ma&s;ter a baronet! And the e&s;tates of that baronet to be his own, as he &s;uppo&s;es, to all eter|nity. For the avaricious dreams of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s are &s;atisfied with nothing le&s;s. The&s;e are joys that &s;well and enlarge even his narrow heart, into &s;omething that endeavours to mimic urbanity.</P>
<P>Whenever Sir Arthur mentions Lord Fitz-Allen, or the family con&s;ent, ho|ne&s;t Aby in a moment conjures up Wen|bourne-Hill, a hermitage, and a wil|derne&s;s; and for the fir&s;t day, if he found that do&s;e not &s;trong enough to produce its effect, foreclo&s;ures were add|ed to the mixture. Your own heart, Loui&s;a, will tell you what Frank's feel|ings were at &s;uch a mean menace; and,

though to &s;top his garrulity entirely was not in the power of man, he determined to &s;ilence him on that &s;ubject. But the cunning Abimelech turned even this in|cident to advantage, by taking care to inform Sir Arthur of Frank's genero&s;ity.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Dover Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JOIN chorus and rejoice with me, Fairfax, for I feel &s;omething like a tran|&s;ient hilarity of heart. I think I am half in a temper to tell my tale as it ought to be told. Time was when it would have been pregnant with humour.</P>
<P>The very ma&s;ter-devil that I wanted
<PB N="102" REF="104">
has appeared to me, and we have &s;igned and con&s;igned our&s;elves over to the great work of mutual vengeance! Be patient and you &s;hall hear the manner of it.</P>
<P>Two nights ago I was at the theatre. The king was there; Garrick played; the crowd was great, and no places were to be procured. During the fir&s;t act I and two more &s;tood elbowing each other at the door of one of the front boxes, the &s;eats of which were all full. The per&s;on who was next me was hard-fa|voured, had a look of audacious impu|dence, with that mixture of dre&s;s which forms the vulgar genteel, and &s;poke the brogue.</P>
<P>The act being over the audience ro&s;e, and my gentleman, with the noncha|lance
<PB N="103" REF="105">
a&s;&s;urance of his character, a total di&s;regard of the feelings and conveni|ence of others, and an entire complai|&s;ance for his own, &s;tepped forward into the &s;econd &s;eat from the door, on which there were previou&s;ly four people, its full compliment. But he had noticed they were not all &s;o athletic as him&s;elf, and was determined to make them &s;it clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons next him, ob&s;erving his redoubtable look, he&s;itated for a mo|ment, but at length began to remon|&s;trate. They addre&s;&s;ed him two or three times without his deigning to appear to hear them; till, either encouraged by his &s;ilence or warmed by vexation, they &s;poke loud enough to call the attention of the people around them.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">
The Hibernian then &s;at him&s;elf down, threw his arm over the railing of the box, and his body in a carele&s;s po&s;ture, and very coolly an&s;wered&mdash;<Q>Pray now be a&s;y, and don't di&s;turb the good company.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;quabble en&s;ued, and the Iri&s;hman continued to an&s;wer them with the ut|mo&s;t contempt. In a &s;hort time two of them gained courage enough to threaten to turn him out; to which he replied&mdash;<Q>Oh! By the &s;weet Ja&s;us but I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the pretty boy that would dare to lay a little finger upon me!</Q></P>
<P>After another wrangle, and treating their rea&s;onings and half menaces with the mo&s;t contemptuous di&s;regard, a gen|tleman from the next box interfered,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
and ob&s;erved it certainly was very im|proper behaviour. The Iri&s;hman turned round, &s;urveyed him from head to foot, and an&s;wered&mdash;<Q>I find you have all got your quarrelling tackle on board to night; and &s;o as I mu&s;t fight &s;ome|body, and as you, mi&s;ter, appear to be the mo&s;t of a gintleman, why I will talk to you when the play is over. For which rai&s;on &s;it down, and make all your&s;elves a&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>The beginning of the &s;econd act and the impatience of the hou&s;e to hear their favourite &s;oon impo&s;ed &s;ilence, and the Iri&s;hman kept his &s;eat.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much diverted by the com|plete impudence of the fellow, that though one of the box-keepers had found me a place, I determined to re|turn,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
and &s;ee how this petty brawl was to end. Accordingly I took care to be round in time, before the curtain drop|ped; till which the hero of it had kept quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his u&s;urped &s;eat.</P>
<P>The moment the audience ro&s;e he turned about, and with a look which I imagine no man but him&s;elf could a&s;|&s;ume, fir&s;t on this &s;ide of him and next on that, addre&s;&s;ed his opponents with&mdash;<Q>Now if any of you are &s;till di&s;ordered in the body, and want to lo&s;e a little blood, why follow me.</Q></P>
<P>The two per&s;ons that &s;at next to him were both Jews, and one of them who appeared to have the mo&s;t &s;pirit had a knotted crab-&s;tick in his hand, and in|&s;i&s;ted that the Iri&s;hman &s;hould not leave the company, till he had fir&s;t given &s;a|tisfaction
<PB N="107" REF="109">
for the in&s;ult he had committed on them all. The Hibernian replied&mdash;<Q>All? Is it all together you mane, or one after another? Perhaps you don't under&s;tand the tools of a gintle|man, and want to box me! Faith and I &s;hould have no great objection to that either, with any half dozen of you, one down and t'other come on. But you mu&s;t u&s;e no unlawful wea|pons, my &s;weet fillow.</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he wre&s;ted the Jew's crab|&s;tick from him, laid hold of it at each end, and &s;napped it in two acro&s;s the railing of the box; adding with infi|nite compo&s;ure of countenance&mdash;<Q>This is an improper plaything for you, ma&s;ter Jackey, and you might do your&s;elf a damage with it. Here is
<PB N="108" REF="110">
half a crown for you. Take it, man, and buy your&s;ilf a genteel bit of rat|tan, to beat the little pug dogs away, when they bark after you in the &s;treet.</Q></P>
<P>In&s;olent as the fellow was, there was no re&s;i&s;ting his humour, and the laugh was general. The vexed I&s;raelite en|deavoured to per&s;i&s;t, and the Iri&s;hman drew a dirty letter out of his pocket, from the back of which he tore the di|rection, and giving it to the angry Jew, &s;aid&mdash;<Q>If you have any &s;tomach for a good breakfa&s;t tomorrow morning, I &s;hall be at home; and the hot rolls and butter will be ready at ten.</Q></P>
<P>He then &s;trode over the &s;eats and went into the lobby, where he was fol|lowed by the crowd.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">
My curio&s;ity was highly excited, and I reque&s;ted the Jew to let me read his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Imagine, Fairfax, my &s;urpri&s;e at &s;ee|ing the name of Mac Fane! That is, of the gambler and bully who &s;ome time ago had been attempting to plunder brother Edward; and who had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed by the family knight-errant, Henley! Among the bu&s;y conjectures of my fermenting brain concerning the in&s;truments I might hap|pen to want, &s;hould things as they have done come to an extremity, the &s;uppo&s;ed qualifications of this hero had more than once pa&s;&s;ed in review. The behaviour to which I had this evening been a wit|ne&s;s perfectly confirmed all my former conjectures, which I in&s;tantly recol|lected;
<PB N="110" REF="112">
I therefore determined not to lo&s;e &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>Before I knew who he was I had been glad to &s;ee the &s;quabble continued, be|cau&s;e it drew out the &s;trong traits of this very eccentric genius; but I grew im|patient to put an end to it the moment I had made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The thing was not difficult. His character was too de&s;perate and deter|mined not to in&s;pire fear; and the hu|mour of his phra&s;eology and brogue made the laugh always on his &s;ide. The pa&s;&s;ions of his opponents counteracting each other died away. The farce was going to begin, and he advi&s;ed them to <Q>go, and not lo&s;e full eighteen penny|worth out of their five &s;hillings.</Q></P>
<P>Finding the mor&s;el was too hard for
<PB N="111" REF="113">
their dige&s;tion, they took his advice and returned quietly to their &s;eats: while he &s;everal times traver&s;ed the lobby, and looked fir&s;t into one box and then into another, to let them &s;ee that there he was.</P>
<P>My re&s;olution was formed, and I &s;oon found an opportunity of falling into con|ver&s;ation with him; and as I took care that my tone &s;hould an&s;wer the intended purpo&s;e, he pre&s;ently invited me to ad|journ, and take what he called a bottle and a bird at the Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>The propo&s;al exactly &s;uited me, and away we went.</P>
<P>He called for a private room, which I &s;hould have done if he had not, though with a very different view. My appear|ance made him hope he had caught a
<PB N="112" REF="114">
gudgeon. He pre&s;ently began to turn the di&s;cour&s;e upon various kinds of gaming. Billiards, tennis, hazard, and pa&s;s-dice, were each of them mentioned; and, to encourage him, I gave him to under&s;tand I knew them all. He then talked of cards, and a&s;ked if I had any objection to take a hand at picquet; <Q>ju&s;t to pa&s;s away an hour before &s;up|per.</Q> I an&s;wered none.</P>
<P>Accordingly the waiter was rung for, and the cards were pre&s;ently upon the table.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed playing for a trifle; from one guinea to five; not more; <Q>beca&s;e as why, he was tied up from deep play. He had lo&s;t five thou&s;and pounds within &s;ix weeks, and they had had a pretty pigeon of him!</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="113" REF="115">
[Had you but &s;een the form and fea|tures of this pigeon, Fairfax!] <Q>For which rai&s;on he mu&s;t take care and not be plucked any more. It was the misfortune of his timper not to know when to &s;top; and there was not &s;o unlucky a fillow in the three kingdoms. He was always the bubble, play at what he would, and every &s;nap-jack knew him to be his mark.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the le&s;&s;on which this fellow had got by rote, and had been retailing to all comers for years. But I have ob&s;erved of gamblers that they cannot forbear rehear&s;ing their own cant even in the company of each other, and when they are convinced every &s;oul that hears them knows they are lying.</P>
<P>I however had my purpo&s;e to &s;erve,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
and we &s;at down to our game. The &s;takes were five guineas a &s;ide. Ac|cording to cu&s;tom, I won the three or four fir&s;t games; and he pretended to cur&s;e, and fret, and again ran over his bead-roll of being pigeoned, plucked bare, bubbled, done up, and the whole catalogue of like genteel phra&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t game he won he propo&s;ed, as luck was perhaps taking a turn in his favour, to double the &s;takes, and I in|dulged him. He &s;uffered me to win the following game. I &s;ay &s;uffered, cheating being taken into the account; for I am certain that at the fair game I am his ma&s;ter. But that is no mat|ter.</P>
<P>The three following games were all his own, and he then began to repeat
<PB N="115" REF="117">
the remainder of his part. <Q>By the bli&s;&s;ed Ja&s;us he would not believe his own eyes! Three games together!</Q> The fellow &s;wore, with one of the deep|e&s;t oaths his memory could furni&s;h, &s;uch a thing had never happened to him be|fore in his whole life! <Q>But now that he was in luck, he would as &s;oon play for a hundred guineas as for a thir|teener.</Q></P>
<P>He endeavoured to provoke me to in|crea&s;e the &s;take; and, by the &s;upper not coming up, I am convinced the waiter and he under&s;tood each other, and that the &s;ignal had been given. I refu&s;ed to play for a greater &s;um, and we continued till he had won fifty guineas, he ince&s;|&s;antly &s;wearing&mdash;<Q>By the bli&s;&s;ed crook! By the hind leg of the holy lamb!
<PB N="116" REF="118">
By Saint Peter's pretty beard!</Q> and by all manner of oaths, &s;ome of them of the mo&s;t whim&s;ical and others of the mo&s;t horrible kind, that he had never been a winner &s;o much before in all his life. From the fir&s;t ten guineas that he won to the la&s;t it was &s;till the &s;ame tune.</P>
<P>I then rang the bell and ordered &s;upper, thinking the &s;um &s;acrificed quite &s;ufficient; though not more than enough to &s;erve my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>While we were eating, he endea|voured by all the arts he knew to excite the pa&s;&s;ion of gaming in me; and he is a tolerable adept. But my mind was too intent upon another &s;ubject. I watched the moment when he was at the height of his hopes, which I had purpo&s;ely en|couraged to produce my intended effect,
<PB N="117" REF="119">
and then a&s;ked him if he did not know Captain St, Ives?</P>
<P>Impudent as the fellow is, his counte|nance for a moment was fixed, his mouth open, and his eye &s;truggling to get rid of alarm, that it might begin its enqui|ries. I followed up my blow by adding&mdash;</P>
<P>You won three thou&s;and guineas of him I think, Mr. Mac Fane, which I am told were never paid&mdash;</P>
<P>The fellow put his hand into a &s;ide|pocket, which he had in the body of his coat. I in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pected he had a &s;mall pair of pi&s;tols there, and my &s;u&s;pi|cions were afterward confirmed. He drew it back, having &s;atisfied him&s;elf that they were actually forth-coming, and then recovered him&s;elf &s;o far as to a&s;k&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
Pray, &s;ir, are you acquainted with Captain St. Ives?&mdash;</P>
<P>I am, &s;ir, an&s;wered I&mdash;I likewi&s;e know Mr. Henley.</P>
<P>You do, &s;ir? &s;aid the a&s;toni&s;hed Mac Fane.</P>
<P>I do, &s;ir. I am intimate with Sir Arthur St. Ives, and he is the &s;on of his gardener: a low fellow that acts as the baronet's man of all work; his &s;teward, his over&s;eer, and his ca&s;h-keeper.</P>
<P>This contempt thrown on the cha|racter of Henley gave the Iri&s;hman &s;ome relief. By the holy poker, &s;aid Mac Fane, but I always thought he was a &s;palpeen, and no gintleman!</P>
<P>I think you have no great cau&s;e to like him much, &s;ir, continued I, from the account that I have heard.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">
His choler began to ri&s;e, and his eyes a&s;&s;umed an uncommon ferocity. Like him! Sweet Ja&s;us &s;natch me out of the world if I don't pay off an old &s;core with him yet, before I die.</P>
<P>I thought as much, &s;ir, an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>Sir! Replied he, again &s;taring with reviving alarm and &s;u&s;picion&mdash;</P>
<P>I continued.&mdash;To tell you the truth, Mr. Mac Fane, that is the very &s;ubject which brought you and I into company this evening. I &s;u&s;pected your hate of Henley, and to be &s;incere I hate him too.</P>
<P>Had you &s;een the fellow's face brighten, Fairfax, and after brightening begin to flame, you would not have rea|dily forgotten the picture.</P>
<P>But I am rather &s;urpri&s;ed to meet you in public, &s;ir, added I.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
What do you mane by that, &s;ir?</P>
<P>I thought you deemed it prudent to keep out of the way, on account of that affair?</P>
<P>I felt &s;ome gratification in playing thus upon his fears&mdash;He now once more put his hand into his &s;ide-pocket, and pulling out his pi&s;tols laid them before him. By Ja&s;us, &s;ir, I don't very well know what you would be at! But when I under&s;tand the full tote of your que&s;tions, I &s;hall know how to give an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I could not very well dige&s;t this ob|lique menace; but to have quarrelled with &s;uch a ra&s;cal would in every &s;en&s;e have been madne&s;s. You have a well|mounted pair of pi&s;tols there, &s;aid I, Mr. Mac Fane. I'll bet you the fifty gui|neas,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
double or quit, I break this china plate at the fir&s;t &s;hot, ten paces di&s;|tant.</P>
<P>By the great grumbler, an&s;wered he, but I'll bet you don't! immediately delivering me one pi&s;tol, and taking up and unlocking the other him&s;elf. Ac|cordingly I placed the plate again&s;t the wall, fired, and was not far from the centre. Upon my honour and &s;oul, &s;ir, &s;aid Mac Fane, but I find you are a good &s;hot, and I &s;hall be glad to be bet|ter acquainted with you.</P>
<P>Having convinced him that I could hit a mark as well as him&s;elf, I returned to the &s;ubject of Henley; and though I could not bring him to be explicit, I learned from him that he was acquainted with Henley's aver&s;ion to pro&s;ecute, but
<PB N="122" REF="124">
does not know on what that aver&s;ion is founded. Be&s;ide which he confides in a want of witne&s;&s;es, as I could perceive: except that he has &s;ome fear of his ac|complice, Webb; a man in who&s;e com|pany this very Mac Fane once attempted to rob Sir Arthur, and whom I &s;u&s;pect he would impeach, but that it would ruin all his gambling views. For he has found means of a&s;&s;ociating with that whole cla&s;s of young fools of fortune, who&s;e perverted education leads them to take plea&s;ure in the impudence and hu|mour of &s;uch a fellow, as well as in &s;ee|ing each other &s;tripped and ruined by turns; but who would never admit him as a companion, did they know he had been guilty of an act &s;o de&s;perate as that of going on the highway. Scarcely any
<PB N="123" REF="125">
thing &s;hort of this can expel &s;uch a fel|low from &s;uch &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But though he thinks him&s;elf &s;ecure in con&s;equence of the lenity of Henley, he hates him as &s;incerely as if he were pur&s;uing him to the gallows. The lo&s;s of the three thou&s;and guineas is one great motive; and another is that he felt he was out-braved by Henley, whom he could not terrify, but who on the con|trary terrified him.</P>
<P>I found he had even formed a &s;cheme of petty vengeance, which was to waylay Henley with &s;ome brui&s;ing fellows of his acquaintance, for he is acquainted with daring villains of all de&s;criptions, one of whom was to in&s;ult, provoke him to fight, and beat him, while Mac Fane
<PB N="124" REF="126">
him&s;elf &s;hould keep at &s;ome di&s;tance, di&s;gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome difficulty I could per&s;uade him to de&s;i&s;t from this plan, and join in projects of my own. But at la&s;t however he was convinced that to rob him of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and awaken him from all his dreams of imaginary bli&s;s to the torture I am preparing, would be more effectual revenge than a paltry beating. Not to mention that I firmly believe, in&s;tead of being beaten, he would conquer the be&s;t prize-fighter they could bring; for he is really a pow|erful and extraordinary fellow.</P>
<P>But you will perceive, Fairfax, I was obliged to inform him of a part of my own views; and that I might fix him I
<PB N="125" REF="127">
determined to bid high. I told him I had Henley and another per&s;on to &s;e|cure; and that if he would aid me him|&s;elf and provide other a&s;&s;i&s;tants to act under his directions, without &s;eeing or being informed of me, I would give him a thou&s;and guineas as &s;oon as all this &s;hould be perfectly accompli&s;hed. And, as an earne&s;t of my genero&s;ity, I put down the fifty guineas; &s;aying that the wager I had made with him was not a fair one, for that it was fifty guineas to a &s;traw in my favour: he had no chance of winning.</P>
<P>He was quite &s;atisfied with my offer, &s;trengthened as it was by the gratifica|tion of his own pa&s;&s;ions. I told him what a pui&s;&s;ant hero Henely is, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of coming upon him by
<PB N="126" REF="128">
&s;urpri&s;e. I told him I had &s;een a hou&s;e, as before de&s;cribed, beyond Knight&s;bridge, which plea&s;ed me; but that I could not find another near enough, in which to &s;ecure Henley.</P>
<P>The geography of the place I men|tioned &s;eemed to &s;tart an idea in his mind, and he told me, if I would meet him in two days at the &s;ame tavern, he would in the mean time not only make prepa|rations and procure a&s;&s;i&s;tants, but per|haps bring me further intelligence. As the fellow's brain &s;eemed bu&s;y, I did not wi&s;h to rob him of the &s;elf-&s;atisfaction of invention, and we accordingly parted, making the appointment he pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Of all exi&s;ting beings, he perhaps
<PB N="127" REF="129">
was the only one who could in a country like this become the proper in&s;trument of my revenge. And yet, Fairfax, he is a hateful fellow! His language, his looks, his manners, his pa&s;&s;ions, are all hateful! Courage excepted, there is not a &s;ingle trait in him but what is abo|minable! He delights in talking of hocking men, chalking them, and cut|ting them down! Every time his anger ri&s;es again&s;t any one, the&s;e are its atten|dant ideas. Such a fellow mu&s;t come to &s;ome tragical end. He can never die of old age, and &s;carcely of di&s;ea&s;e. No|thing but the lead and &s;teel in which he delights can end him.</P>
<P>So it is, and I have no remedy. But he &s;hall be to me no more than an im|plement,
<PB N="128" REF="130">
with which I will carve the coming banquet.</P>
<P>How minute are the chances and events on which we depend! A few &s;light alterations of incident, and how dif|ferent would have been the train of my thoughts! She might have been happy with me, for I loved her, Fairfax. I loved her. I feel it more and more; and were but circum&s;tances a little more &s;avourable, I believe I &s;hould turn about and take a contrary path.</P>
<P>But it cannot be! The barrier is in|&s;urmountable! An adamantine wall, reaching to the &s;kies! I remember what &s;he &s;aid, at her proud uncle's ta|ble&mdash;<Q>I have an abhorrence, Mr. Clif|ton, of the errors in which you are
<PB N="129" REF="131">
now indulging.</Q>&mdash;Abhorrence was the word, Fairfax!&mdash;It has been at my tongue's end ever &s;ince&mdash;And when &s;he talked of my errors &s;he meant me.&mdash;<Q>I ultimately and determinedly renounce all thought of him!</Q>&mdash;This was her language! I knew before which way her heart went; and can I &s;uppo&s;e, now &s;he has got a fair excu&s;e, that &s;he will not profit by it? Oh no! I am not &s;o ill read as that in the pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>I HAVE received your di&s;&s;ua&s;ive epi&s;tle, Fairfax. It found me moody and did not contribute to make me merry. To own the truth, no gho&s;t need ri&s;e to tell me the methods I u&s;e are inclined to the violent. Can you find me better? Nay can you find any

<P>Time was that I could have been happy with her! Ay and &s;hould, but for this fiend Henley. He &s;leeps &s;e|curely! Let him &s;leep on! I will &s;oon awaken him!</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould have been tortured but by one chief pa&s;&s;ion, and that the love of vengeance would have enveloped me wholly: but they are all devouring me by turns. I certainly hate her, and him I abhor. Yet pictures of imaginary happine&s;s, that might have been, are continually ri&s;ing, and vani&s;hing in gloomy regret. He too, at the very moment that I could murder him, I am obliged to admire!</P>
<P>Still he &s;hall not have her! Though
<PB N="132" REF="134">
death overtake him, her and me, he &s;hall not have her! But what is death? A thing to covet, not to dread. 'Tis exi&s;tence only that is hateful!&mdash;Would that my bones were now moul|dering!&mdash;Why have I brains and nerves and &s;en&s;ibilities?&mdash;Oh that I were in the poi&s;onous de&s;ert, where I might gulp mephitic winds and drop dead; or in a moment be buried in tornados of burn|ing &s;and! Would that my &s;cull were grinning there, and blanching; rather than as it is con&s;ciou&s;ly parching, &s;corched by fires it&s;elf has kindled!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I &s;pent all ye&s;terday with that Iri&s;h &s;coundrel. Malignity is his element, and mi&s;chief his delight! I &s;u&s;pect by
<PB N="133" REF="135">
his a&s;&s;iduity that he is poor ju&s;t at pre|&s;ent; for a more indu&s;trious demon black Cocytus does not yield. He is already provided with a&s;&s;ociates, and has found another principal agent for the great work. It is a &s;trange expedient! But the&s;e are &s;trange fellows l And yet it is a lucky one; &s;uperior to any that I had projected.</P>
<P>When I mentioned the Knight&s;bridge road at our fir&s;t interview, Mac Fane re|collected that an intimate of his had ju&s;t &s;et up what was to him a new trade, in the neighbourhood; that of being the keeper of a madhou&s;e. He determined to go and propo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s to him; and as the fellow was preparing to ad|verti&s;e for lunatics, but had not yet got
<PB N="134" REF="136">
a &s;ingle patient, there was a complete opening for &s;uch a plan.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed taking me to &s;ee this intended guardian of maniacs, and his hou&s;e; and I ordered a po&s;t-chai&s;e for that purpo&s;e, that I might hide my&s;elf in one corner of it, and not let a living &s;oul detect me with &s;uch a com|panion.</P>
<P>As we were going, I enquired if this keeper were an Iri&s;hman? He took of|fence, and retorted&mdash;<Q>What did I mane by an Iri&s;hman? Beca&s;e he is a rogue you think he is an Iri&s;hman! By the holy carpenter you need not come to Ireland for that kind of ware! You have a viry pritty breed of rogues of your own! But he is not Iri&s;h. He
<PB N="135" REF="137">
is one of your own &s;ulky Engli&s;h bugs.</Q></P>
<P>The de&s;cription was not inapplicable, for I think I never beheld a more low|ering, black-browed, evil-eyed fellow, &s;ince the hour I fir&s;t &s;aw light. He had all the gloom of the mo&s;t irra&s;cible bull|dog, but without his generous courage. He &s;eemed more proper to make men mad than cure them of madne&s;s. But he had two excellent qualities for my purpo&s;e; poverty and a di&s;po&s;ition to all ill.</P>
<P>I am got into excellent company! But I care not! I will on! All this &s;eems as if it were but the prologue to the tragedy. But be it that, or be it what it will&mdash;I care nothing for my&s;elf;
<PB N="136" REF="138">
and I have little cau&s;e to care more for them. She never had any mercy on me; and lea&s;t this la&s;t interview, when I was pleading before her pompous uncle.</P>
<P>I have been obliged to hold con&s;ul|tations with the&s;e Satanic ra&s;cals, to concert ways and means. The mo&s;t &s;e|cure we have been able to devi&s;e, rela|tive to Henley, is to have a &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, to come upon him &s;uddenly, and to encru&s;t him in it before he &s;hall know what we are about. This with a gag will make him &s;afe. But there mu&s;t not be le&s;s than four fellows, and tho&s;e &s;tout ones. Nothing mu&s;t be left to chance.</P>
<P>Three more mu&s;t be provided for the lady, of whom Mac Fane him&s;elf pro|po&s;es
<PB N="137" REF="139">
to be one. But he means to keep out of &s;ight of Henley, till he is in cuf|tody.</P>
<P>I have various preparations yet to make. Mac Fane is to go and hire me the empty hou&s;e tomorrow. It is fur|ni&s;hed; but it mu&s;t be aired, for I would not have her die a paltry catch-cold death. I would treat her like a gentle|woman in every re&s;pect but one; and in that I will have as little compa&s;&s;ion on her as &s;he has had on me.</P>
<P>It might have been otherwi&s;e! I came to her a generous lover! I &s;aw her and was amazed at her beauties, capti|vated by her enchanting manners, &s;ooth|ed by her unvaried &s;weetne&s;s! But this &s;weetne&s;s &s;he has turned to gall! I adored her, and was prepared eternally
<PB N="138" REF="140">
to adore! But injury followed injury in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that apathy it&s;elf called aloud for vengeance!</P>
<P>I own it is true what &s;he &s;aid at her uncle's, that I had made a re&s;olution not to marry her. But what were my re&s;olutions? She her&s;elf could not but feel &s;he had the power to break them all. But &s;he had not the will, Fairfax! It rankles there! She hates me, and what is more damnable &s;he loves another!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I mu&s;t turn my thoughts again to this dete&s;ted mad-hou&s;e man, and the &s;ce|nery around it. All the avenues mu&s;t be examined, and all the bye-paths and open roads that lead toward both hou&s;es in&s;pected, that Mac Fane and his emi&s;&s;a|ries
<PB N="139" REF="141">
may make no blunder. I will if po&s;&s;ible keep out of the action, but I will be near at hand.</P>
<P>I have a &s;ecret wi&s;h, the moment all is over, to fly the odious &s;cene; for hor|ribly odious it will be: but it would have the appearance of cowardice. It mu&s;t end tragically! Not even the poor creatures who &s;tand in the place of her natural guardians, tame as they are, can &s;uffer &s;uch an in&s;ult. Yet which of them dare look me in the face, and call him&s;elf my enemy? And, after injuring her, &s;hall I he&s;itate at trampling upon them?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;teel my heart, Fairfax, when I go to the encounter; mu&s;t recapitulate all my wrongs. I have them noted down &s;everally as they occurred! I

<P>HAVE I been unju&s;t to the bro|ther of my friend? Or had my words the power over him to turn him from a guilty purpo&s;e?&mdash;Well; rather, ay in|finitely rather let me be a fal&s;e accu&s;er than he culpable! He &s;eeks me no more, offers not to mole&s;t me, and I

hope has forgotten me; at lea&s;t has &s;een the error of endeavouring to ac|compli&s;h a purpo&s;e &s;o criminal by means &s;o ba&s;e. I expected &s;torms, but a &s;weet calm has &s;ucceeded that &s;eems to por|tend tranquillity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to me and Frank, our union appears to be ha&s;tening to a conclu|&s;ion. Sir Arthur, impelled forward by his hopes and fears, proceeds though re|luctantly to act contrary to the wi&s;hes of my arrogant uncle. Mrs. Wenbourne is di&s;&s;atisfied; but her oppo&s;ition is fee|ble, for Edward is reconciled to the match; having no other motive but the acqui&s;ition of a &s;um of money for his con&s;ent to dock the entail; and of the manner in which this &s;um will be &s;quan|dered
<PB N="146" REF="148">
we have already had &s;ufficient proof.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand Lord Fitz-Allen affects to credit a report of a very ridiculous, though as &s;ome would think it of a very injurious nature; which is that there was a collu&s;ion between Frank Henley and Mac Fane re&s;pecting my brother's gambling affair. The circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to render this probable are &s;o violent as immediately to expo&s;e its ab|&s;urdity, and to make it matter of amaze|ment how &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion could be in|vented, or circulated.</P>
<P>What could be Frank's motive?&mdash;My wi&s;e uncle has his an&s;wer ready&mdash;<Q>That of impo&s;ing upon the family in order to marry me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">
And what Mac Fane's? "A bribe" is a &s;hort phra&s;e, and &s;oon &s;aid.</P>
<P>I imagine it to be &s;ome dream of my uncle's, who has an aptitude for this kind of invention; and who having once put a few incidents together that &s;eem to agree, per&s;uades him&s;elf with great faci|lity that the fable he has created is fact. Petty calumny like this is wholly inca|pable of moving Frank Henley.</P>
<P>The re&s;tle&s;s crafty Abimelech has pre|vailed on Sir Arthur to go down with him to Wenbourne-Hill. He well knows how much his own power will be increa&s;ed by the old habits of Sir Ar|thur, and the ea&s;e with which they can be revived by this his intere&s;ted abettor. Not but I am well convinced, when once every thing &s;hall be &s;ettled, and he have
<PB N="148" REF="150">
no longer any thing to fear from the op|po&s;ition of Sir Arthur, he will be as little a friend to improving as any of us. Va|rious hints which have dropped from him would have proved this to Sir Ar|thur, had he not been blind enough to &s;uppo&s;e that, he being a baronet, hone&s;t Aby is bound ever to remain his mo&s;t obedient &s;lave and &s;teward; forgetting the proofs he has received that Abime|lech at pre&s;ent is more inclined to com|mand than to obey; and that when he parts with money he mu&s;t have what he calls the whys and the wherefores.</P>
<P>His confidence in Frank however is now &s;o entire that he has entru&s;ted the tran&s;action of certain money bu&s;ine&s;s to him, nece&s;&s;ary on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, which he came up purpo&s;ely to nego|tiate
<PB N="149" REF="151">
him&s;elf, but which he is now con|vinced can be done full as prudently and &s;afely by his &s;on. But a few months ago, Frank tells me, he petitioned this father in vain for thirty pounds, who now commits thou&s;ands to his keeping.</P>
<P>Not but it is from a conviction that there is no propen&s;ity in Frank to wa&s;te one of tho&s;e guineas of which he is &s;o enamoured. Without the lea&s;t love of money, Frank is a rigid economi&s;t. The father indulges no fal&s;e wants be|cau&s;e it would be expen&s;ive; the &s;on has none to indulge. Habits which in the one are the fruits of avarice, in the other are the offspring of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Abimelech has &s;ome confu&s;ed &s;u&s;pi|cion that Frank acts from higher mo|tives than him&s;elf, and &s;uch as he does
<PB N="150" REF="152">
not under&s;tand; but &s;till he hopes they are all founded on his own favourite ba&s;is, the love of hoarding. Nor can he very well per&s;uade him&s;elf that this love is not the grand mover with all men of &s;en&s;e, among whom he now ranks his &s;on high.</P>
<P>But ah, Loui&s;a, how different are the views of this worthy, this heavenly|gifted &s;on! He is anxiou&s;ly &s;tudious to di&s;cover how he may apply the wealth that may revert to him mo&s;t to benefit that &s;ociety from which it fir&s;t &s;prang. The be&s;t application of riches is one of our frequent themes; becau&s;e it will be one of our fir&s;t duties. The diffu&s;ion of knowledge, or more properly of truth, is the one great good to which wealth, genius, and exi&s;tence ought all to be ap|plied.
<PB N="151" REF="153">
This noble purpo&s;e gives birth to felicity which is in it&s;elf grand, inex|hau&s;tible, and eternal.</P>
<P>How ineffable is the bli&s;s of having di&s;covered a friend like Frank Henley, who will not only pur&s;ue this be&s;t of purpo&s;es him&s;elf, but will through life conduct me in the &s;ame path, will aid my efforts to promote the great work, and, by a combination of tho&s;e powers we happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s, will add energy to effort, and perhaps render it fifty fold more pervading and effective!</P>
<P>Hu&s;band and wife, parent and child are ties which at pre&s;ent claim, or rather extort a part of our attention. But oh how poor how in&s;ignificant are they, when compared to the claims of eternal ju&s;tice; which bind man to man in equal
<PB N="152" REF="154">
and impartial benevolence over the face of the whole earth, and render the wan|dering Arab, who is in need of aid or in&s;truction from me, as truly my brother as the one my mother gave me.</P>
<P>I &s;eem now but beginning the journey of life; and to have found a compa|nion, guide, and con&s;oler like Frank Henley is &s;urely no common felicity! May the fates grant my Loui&s;a ju&s;t &s;uch another!</P>

<P>OH, Oliver, how fair is the pro&s;pect before me! How fruitful of felicity, how abundant in bli&s;s! Yes, my friend, jointly will we labour, your mo&s;t wor|thy father, you, I, Anna, her friend, and all the converts we can make to truth,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
to promote the great end we &s;eek! We will form a little band which will daily increa&s;e, will &s;well to a multitude, ay till it embrace the whole human &s;pe|cies!</P>
<P>Surely, Oliver, to be furni&s;hed with &s;o many of the means of promulgating univer&s;al happine&s;s is no &s;mall ble&s;&s;ing. My feelings are all rapture! And yet if I know my heart, it is not becau&s;e I have gained a &s;elfi&s;h &s;olitary good; but becau&s;e I live in an age when light be|gins to appear even in regions that have hitherto been thick darkne&s;s; and that I my&s;elf am &s;o highly fortunate as to be able to contribute to the great the uni|ver&s;al cau&s;e; the progre&s;s of truth, the extirpation of error, and the general perfection of mind! I and tho&s;e dear
<PB N="156" REF="158">
friends I have named; who are indeed dear becau&s;e of their ardent and uniform love of virtue!</P>
<P>Neither, Oliver, are all our hopes of Clifton lo&s;t. Anna thinks, and &s;o do I, that he has heard too much ever to forget it all: or rather that he has a mind &s;o penetrating, and &s;o eternally bu&s;y, that, having been once led to enquire, it is &s;carcely in the power of accident wholly to impede the progre&s;s of en|quiry. And &s;hould accident be favoura|ble, that progre&s;s would indeed be ra|pid! By his intercour&s;e with Anna his mind is become impregnated with the &s;eeds of truth; and &s;urely the &s;oil is too rich for the&s;e &s;eeds not to &s;pring, bud, and bear a plenteous harve&s;t. Ay, Oli|ver, fear not. It is not the beauty of
<PB N="157" REF="159">
the picture that &s;educes, but the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, which declare the re&s;ult for which we hope to be inevitable.</P>
<P>My pre&s;ent &s;tate of happine&s;s meets &s;ome &s;light check from incidental cir|cum&s;tances, not in my power to guide. My father and Sir Arthur are doing what I believe to be a right thing, but from wrong motives. The prodigal Ed|ward, from a very different avarice of enjoyment, is eager to dock the entail. The &s;um he is to receive will &s;oon be &s;quandered, and he will then be as eager to imagine him&s;elf treated with inju&s;|tice; and will conceive him&s;elf left half to peri&s;h with want, if his accu&s;tomed di&s;&s;ipation be not &s;upplied. But that it mu&s;t not be. If we can teach him bet|ter we will; if not he mu&s;t be left to
<PB N="158" REF="160">
repine and accu&s;e, and we mu&s;t patiently &s;uffer the error which we cannot cure.</P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Allen indulges him&s;elf in thinking as much ill of me as he can, and in &s;peaking all he thinks. But this is indeed a trifle. I know that the mi&s;takes of his mind, &s;ituated as he is, are incurable; and to grieve or feel pain for what cannot be avoided is nei|ther the act of wi&s;dom nor of virtue.</P>

<P>I DID not intend to have written again &s;o &s;oon, but an incident has occurred which perplexes all rea&s;oning upon it, and again engenders doubt. It relates to Clifton.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night attended Anna to Covent-Garden playhou&s;e, where about eight
<PB N="160" REF="162">
o'clock I was obliged to leave her, hav|ing an appointment with &s;ome gentlemen in the city relative to my father's money affairs at that hour; which having &s;et|tled it was agreed I &s;hould return in the carriage for Anna, before the play was ended, to conduct her home. Accord|ingly having met my men of bu&s;ine&s;s, whom on Friday next I am to meet again to receive eight thou&s;and pounds, I drove back to Covent Garden.</P>
<P>It was then about ten o'clock. The coachman &s;topped at the Piazza. I alighted; but, as I was &s;tepping out of the carriage, whom &s;hould I &s;ee but the gambler and highwayman, Mac Fane, linked arm in arm with Mr. Clifton! I was &s;truck with amazement, as well I might be. A thou&s;and confu&s;ed doubts
<PB N="161" REF="163">
&s;ucceeded to each other, which I had neither time nor indeed power to un|ravel.</P>
<P>However it &s;eemed to me almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible that Mr. Clifton &s;hould know the man, and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;een in public with &s;uch a character. For certainly a want of &s;elf-re&s;pect is not one of the habitual mi&s;takes of Mr. Clifton. I &s;topped &s;ome little time in this &s;tate of perplexity, but at la&s;t con|cluded it would be highly culpable in me to leave Mr. Clifton ignorant of the character of his acquaintance. They had gone toward King-Street, and I ha&s;tened after them.</P>
<P>I &s;oon came up with them, and addre&s;&s;|ing my&s;elf to Mr. Clifton, &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Sir,
<PB N="162" REF="164">
it is incumbent on me to inform you of a particular of which I imagine you are ignorant. The name of the man you are in company with is Mac Fane. You have heard his hi&s;tory. He is the gambler who endeavoured to defraud Captain St. Ives of three thou&s;and pounds.</Q></P>
<P>I have before acquainted thee, Oliver, of the ferocious character of this Mac Fane; of which I have now had further proofs. I had &s;carcely fini&s;hed my phra&s;e before he replied, with one of his accu&s;tomary oaths&mdash;<Q>You're a &s;coun|drel and a liar</Q>&mdash;and immediately made a blow at me.</P>
<P>Being previou&s;ly on my guard and watchful of his motions, I &s;tepped quickly
<PB N="163" REF="165">
back, and he mi&s;&s;ed me and reeled. This was in King-Street, where I overtook them.</P>
<P>I turned back, intending not to notice his in&s;ult; but he was too much enraged to &s;uffer me to e&s;cape, unle&s;s I had thought proper to run. He is a very mu&s;cular fellow, and confident of his own &s;trength. No man could be more determined than I was to avoid &s;o ab&s;urd a conte&s;t, had it been po&s;&s;ible; but it was not. He made &s;everal blows at me, two or three of which took effect, before I returned one of them. But finding that I mu&s;t be obliged to beat him in order to get rid of him, and that there was ab&s;olutely no other mode, I began my ta&s;k with all nece&s;&s;ary determination.</P>
<P>The mob collected apace, and we

were pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by pa&s;&s;engers, waiters, chairmen, footmen, hackney|coachmen and link-boys. It was a &s;trange di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ituation; but it did not admit of a remedy. This fellow, Mac Fane, has &s;tudied the whole &s;chool of a&s;&s;ault, and is a practi&s;ed pugili&s;t. When I was a boy thou knowe&s;t, Oliver, and before thy worthy father had taught me better, I was my&s;elf vain of my &s;kill and prowe&s;s. I was not therefore the novice which he expected to have found. Not to mention, Oliver, that energy of mind, if it be real and true energy, is it&s;elf, without any &s;uch contemptible knowledge, &s;ufficient to overcome the &s;tronge&s;t efforts of tyranny.</P>
<P>Of this I pre&s;ently made Mr. Mac Fane &s;en&s;ible. After the very fir&s;t on&s;et,
<PB N="165" REF="167">
he felt him&s;elf cowed; which increa&s;ed his rage &s;o much that he endeavoured to have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t malignant and cruel expedients, to obtain victory. This obliged me to give him &s;everal hard and very dangerous blows, which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been cautious of doing, and the effects of which he will for &s;ome time continue to feel.</P>
<P>He fought however with great ob&s;ti|nacy, and in a manner which proved how much his ambition was wounded by being conquered. The mob, as in all &s;uch ca&s;es, cho&s;e different &s;ides; but much the greate&s;t part was for me. They &s;everal times &s;aw the malicious and evil intentions of Mac Fane; and he once received a blow for them, from
<PB N="166" REF="168">
one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, which made him more guarded.</P>
<P>It is delightful to the philo&s;opher to perceive how, even in error, ju&s;tice &s;trug|gles to &s;hew it&s;elf. Tho&s;e rules which are the laws of honour to the mob origi|nate in this noble principle: and never is the infraction of ju&s;tice more danger|ous than at &s;uch moments, when the mind is awakened to full exertion.</P>
<P>Still it was a painful and degrading &s;ituation! Wert thou ever at the mercy of a mob? Did&s;t thou ever feel the lit|tlene&s;s of thy own faculties, when ex|erted to make a confu&s;ed multitude act rationally, at the very time that thou thy|&s;elf wert apparently acting like a fool, or a madman? If &s;o, Oliver, thou
<PB N="167" REF="169">
can&s;t conceive &s;omething of the con|tempt which I felt for my&s;elf, during this &s;cene. Can a general, thinke&s;t thou, if he be really a fit per&s;on to be a gene|ral, feel otherwi&s;e in the heat of battle? For I am mi&s;taken if armies of the be&s;t di&s;ciplined men, brought into action, do not more or le&s;s become a mob. And added to this &s;en&s;e of imbecility, what mu&s;t the general's feelings be the next morning, when he goes to view the wretched &s;cene of his own making? Does he go to view it, thinke&s;t thou, or does he &s;hun the &s;ight? If he go he is a fiend; and if he &s;tay away he is wor&s;e!</P>
<P>The battle being ended and the rage of Mr. Mac Fane, though perhaps in|crea&s;ed, obliged to re&s;train it&s;elf, there
<PB N="168" REF="170">
&s;tood I, &s;urrounded by my applauding admirers, &s;uffering a thou&s;and ridiculous interrogatories, and confined to the &s;pot for the want of clothes! My hat and coat I had committed to one per&s;on, and my watch and pur&s;e to another; taking it for granted the latter would have been &s;tolen from me if I had not, as was actually the fact, for my breeches pockets were turned in&s;ide out. I had rightly concluded that the chances were more favourable in tru&s;ting to a per&s;on I &s;hould &s;elect, than to the hone&s;ty of a mob in the confines of Covent-Garden.</P>
<P>I was fortunate: the whole of my moveables again made their appearance; and it gave me great plea&s;ure, becau&s;e I had tru&s;ted my pur&s;e and watch to a poor fellow. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own
<PB N="169" REF="171">
hone&s;ty was a greater plea&s;ure to him than the recompen&s;e he received from me; though I thought it my duty to reward him liberally. Be&s;ide he had &s;een me ill treated, and had conceived an affection for me, or more properly for the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e, and he re|joiced exultingly in my victory.</P>
<P>I e&s;caped from the &s;houts and congra|tulations of my grea&s;y well-meaning companions as fa&s;t as I could; and after a further delay of &s;tepping into a coffee|hou&s;e, to wa&s;h and adju&s;t my appearance as well as circum&s;tances would permit, I joined Anna, who began to be alarmed, the play being over and the hou&s;e almo&s;t empty.</P>
<P>I &s;aw no more of Clifton. But that
<PB N="170" REF="172">
affords me no clue. If he were before unacquainted with Mac Fane, he would ha&s;ten from &s;uch a companion with vex|ation and contempt: and if the contrary, his chagrin at being &s;een by me would equally induce him to &s;hun us. Mind, as I have always remarked, Oliver, and as I have before rea&s;oned with thee re|lative to him, is &s;low in ridding it&s;elf of the habits of prejudice, even when pre|judice it&s;elf &s;eems to have cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>'Tis true that conjectures di&s;advanta|geous to Clifton have, when Anna and I were con&s;idering this incident, in|truded them&s;elves forcibly upon us: but they were only conjectures, and I hope ill founded. Indeed they are improba|ble; for Clifton could not knowingly
<PB N="171" REF="173">
league him&s;elf with a man like Mac Fane, except for purpo&s;es too black or too de&s;perate for even pa&s;&s;ions &s;o violent as his to entertain.</P>
<P>I know mind to be capable of a&s;to|ni&s;hing mi&s;takes; nor can I pretend, when I recollect the proofs on record, to &s;ay what are the boundaries of error; nor indeed what are the boundaries of probability. But I think Clifton could not make him&s;elf the a&s;&s;ociate of Mac Fane!</P>
<P>I &s;hould pronounce more boldly &s;till, but that I cannot conceive how it was po&s;&s;ible for a character &s;o legible and gro&s;s, as that of this gambler, to impo&s;e for a moment on Coke Clifton; ac|quainted as he is with the world, and
<PB N="172" REF="174">
accu&s;tomed to detect and &s;atirize what he under&s;tands to be ab&s;urdity! I can only &s;ay, if he be proceeding in error &s;o flagrant and deep as this, he is a man much to be feared, but more to be pi|tied.</P>

<P>AGAIN and again, Fairfax, this is an infernal world! A vile, di&s;gu&s;ting, de&s;picable, be&s;otted a&s;s of a world! Exi&s;tence in it is not worth accepting; and the &s;ooner we &s;purn it from us the better we &s;hall a&s;&s;ert our claim to the
<PB N="174" REF="176">
dignity and wi&s;dom of which it is de&s;ti|tute.</P>
<P>How do I de&s;pi&s;e the blundering in|&s;olent &s;coundrel with whom I am link|ed! How de&s;picable am I to my&s;elf!</P>
<P>I la&s;t night met the fellow again at the Shake&s;peare. Of all his dirty qua|lities, not one of them is &s;o tormenting as his familiar impudence! There is no repre&s;&s;ing it except by cutting his throat; a bu&s;ine&s;s at which he is always alert. Nothing delights him &s;o much as to talk of extingui&s;hing men, tread|ing out their &s;ouls, feeding upon their life-time, and other &s;trange revolting phra&s;es, all of the &s;ame &s;anguinary &s;ort.</P>
<P>Having con&s;ulted with him concern|ing the &s;eizure of Anna and Frank, and concluded that the affair &s;hould be ended
<PB N="175" REF="177">
as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, I wi&s;hed to have &s;haken him off and retired: but the thing was impracticable. I do not choo&s;e that my own carriage &s;hould at|tend me on the&s;e expeditions; and as it was a rainy night, I knew the difficulty of getting a coach. I therefore &s;taid an hour till the entertainment &s;hould be be|gun, and the Piazza probably more clear.</P>
<P>As there is no &s;itting in his company without &s;ome &s;pecies of gaming, for his whole conver&s;ation, that &s;ubject ex|cepted, con&s;i&s;ts of oaths, duels, and the impudent &s;coundrels he has put out of the world, I took a few throws at hazard with him; and, as I was very careful to call for fre&s;h dice and to watch his motions, I was a winner; hazard per|haps
<PB N="176" REF="178">
being the faire&s;t of all games, if the dice be not foul. He ran over his u&s;ual litany of being pigeoned, and about ten o'clock I left play, and de|termined to &s;ally forth; being appre|hen&s;ive of engaging too deeply at the game, if I &s;taid longer.</P>
<P>The moment we had de&s;cended the &s;tairs he impudently laid hold of my arm. My blood boiled, Fairfax! Yet I was obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>This was not all! The precautions I had taken were but a kind of pre&s;en|timent of the vexation that was prepar|ing for me. Ju&s;t as we quitted the door of the tavern, who &s;hould bolt upon us but the hated Henley! I &s;hook with the broad &s;hame! My teeth gna&s;h|ed cur&s;es! How willingly could I have
<PB N="177" REF="179">
pi&s;toled him, Mac Fane, every being that eyed me, and &s;till more willingly my&s;elf!</P>
<P>But there was nothing for it but to walk on, and &s;eem not to &s;ee him. He however would not &s;uffer me to depart without a double do&s;e of damnation! The &s;ame infernal officiou&s;ne&s;s, with which from the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw me to the la&s;t he has been &s;eized, came upon him; and though I hurried through the Piazza to e&s;cape, like a perjurer from the pillory, he pur&s;ued us purpo&s;ely to inform me I was in company with a ra&s;|cal, and to warn me of my danger.</P>
<P>I never can recollect my own &s;itua|tion, without an impul&s;e to &s;natch up the fir&s;t implement that would deprive me of a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;o dete&s;table!</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
The ira&s;cible fury of the bully rid me of my tormentor; he immediately a&s;|&s;aulted Henley, and I ha&s;tened away from two beings &s;o almo&s;t equally ab|horrent, but from cau&s;es &s;o oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>On the following evening, having another appointment with the gambling ra&s;cal, I took care to have a coach wait|ing, and to go muffled up and di&s;gui&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible. But for once my caution was &s;uperfluous. No Mac Fane appeared.</P>
<P>Not knowing what had happened, and it being night, and I thus properly equipped, I re&s;olved to drive to his lodgings. Being there I &s;ent up my name, and was admitted to the bed|chamber of this doughty exterminator of men. If the temper of my mind
<PB N="179" REF="181">
were not obnoxious to all cheerfulne&s;s, I could almo&s;t have laughed, the bully was &s;o excellently beaten, mortified, and enraged! His head was bound up, his eyes were plai&s;tered, his thumb &s;prained, his body of all colours, and his mind as hotly fevered as Alexander's it&s;elf could have been, had Alexander been vanqui&s;hed at the battle of I&s;&s;us!</P>
<P>His impatience to have Henley in his power is now almo&s;t phren&s;y; and it will be phren&s;y it&s;elf when he comes to find, as find he will, that though he can tie the hands of Henley his conque&s;t mu&s;t end there, and that the pri&s;oner will &s;till defy and contemn his jailor. So would I have him. Henley, though I hate, I cannot but re&s;pect and ad|mire.
<PB N="180" REF="182">
The other is a creature I dete&s;t my&s;elf for ever having known!</P>
<P>Yet who but he could have gratified the unabating burning pa&s;&s;ion of my heart? I feel, Fairfax, as if I had taken my leave of hope, joy, and human in|tercour&s;e! I have a quarrel with the whole race, for having been forced into exi&s;tence and into mi&s;ery! I have &s;uf|fered an accumulation of di&s;grace, for which I can never pardon my&s;elf! And &s;hall I permit the authors of it to live undi&s;turbed in their in&s;ult and triumph over me? No, by hell, come of me what will! Lower I cannot be in my own e&s;teem than I already am: tremble tho&s;e who made me &s;o!</P>
<P>Beating has but rendered this ra&s;cal
<PB N="181" REF="183">
more impatient and active. Every thing is prepared. The hou&s;e is hired, aired, and provided with a proper guardian. The madman keeper has all his implements ready. We have now only to watch and catch them at a pro|per di&s;tance from all &s;uccour, to which in their amorous walks they have fre|quently &s;trayed.</P>
<P>Though even you, Fairfax, &s;eem to di&s;approve my conduct, I care not. Not to give your&s;elf further trouble with what you call &s;uch po&s;itive prudes might be a very good maxim for you, who love your ea&s;e too much ever to be &s;en|&s;ible of the boiling emotions of a &s;oul like mine!

injuries I have communicated would have lighted up a &s;ympathetic flame of retributive vengeance even in you, which not all your phlegm could have quenched. But no matter&mdash;Though heaven, earth, and hell were to face me frowning, I would on!

<P>SINCE the world began, never yet had &s;coundrel wight &s;o many damning acce&s;&s;ary incidents to contend with, as I have had during the whole progre&s;s of this affair! All hell &s;eems bu&s;y to blacken me!&mdash;I have done the deed&mdash;They are &s;ecure&mdash;But the hour of exul|tation
<PB N="184" REF="186">
it&s;elf is embittered, and the legiti|mate triumph of vengeance made to wear the face of ba&s;ene&s;s&mdash;I have them; but as I tell you there is an event, that happened the very moment preceding the &s;eizure, which &s;eems to have been contrived by the mo&s;t malignant of the fiends of darkne&s;s, purpo&s;ely to &s;teep me in guilt indelible!</P>
<P>After our myrmidons had been three days in vain upon the watch, on Friday la&s;t Anna and Henley &s;allied forth, about two in the afternoon, to take one of their amorous rambles. As u&s;ual they were followed by Laura, who had &s;ent me word of their intention, which &s;he had learnt at breakfa&s;t time. Henley it &s;eems had previou&s;ly been into the city.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">
A &s;cout was on the watch, and when they appeared &s;oon brought the intelli|gence. All was in readine&s;s. The keeper with three &s;tout fellows in one party, and Mac Fane with four more in another. The earline&s;s of their &s;etting out denoted they intended to lengthen their walk. The great danger was that it &s;hould have been directed to Ken&s;ington Gar|dens, as it has been &s;everal times lately; but in this in&s;tance fortune was on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>They went into the park, pa&s;&s;ed the gardens, walked be&s;ide the wall, cro&s;&s;ed the Ken&s;ington road, and &s;trayed exactly as we could have wi&s;hed into the fields inclining toward Brompton.</P>
<P>I was on hor&s;eback, and by the help
<PB N="186" REF="188">
of a pocket tele&s;cope kept them in view, without the danger of being &s;een, while they were in the park; but as &s;oon as they had left it I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pur on, and be ready to prevent any blunders. I cro&s;&s;ed the road down the lane at the turnpike, pa&s;&s;ed them, and &s;aw them arm in arm. The &s;ight was in&s;upportable!</P>
<P>From what afterward happened they mu&s;t have &s;een me too, though I ima|gined my&s;elf under cover of the hedge.</P>
<P>You know my determination not to be robbed; and indeed robbery at &s;uch a time, and in &s;uch a place, was a thing I had little rea&s;on to expect. But a fel|low, who was lying in ambu&s;h at the turn of the lane, calculated differently.
<PB N="187" REF="189">
He imagined nobody to be near, and &s;uddenly pre&s;ented him&s;elf and his pi&s;tol, with a demand of my money.</P>
<P>I made a blow at him with the butt end of my whip, which mi&s;&s;ed his head, but fell on his &s;houlder. My hor&s;e &s;tarted, he fired and mi&s;&s;ed, but &s;prung &s;uddenly forward, and &s;eized hold of the bridle. He had another pi&s;tol which he was pre|paring, imagining I &s;hould be more in|timidated when I found him &s;o de&s;pe|rate. All this happened immediately after I had pa&s;&s;ed Anna and Henley; and the latter perhaps having &s;een the fellow, and certainly having heard the pi&s;tol, flew in an in&s;tant, leaped the hedge, and ju&s;t as the robber was again pre&s;enting his pi&s;tol made a blow, and knocked it out of his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
The pi&s;tol went off, and the fellow took to his heels. Henley, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing him, &s;tayed to enquire with much earne&s;tne&s;s whether I had received any hurt.</P>
<P>At this very damning &s;peck of time, Fairfax, the keeper and his &s;coundrels who had been dogging them came up. There were four of them: two be|fore and two behind. The undaunted Henley &s;everally knocked down the two fellows in front, and in an in&s;tant would undoubtedly have been far enough out of all reach; but, in the very act of &s;triking the &s;econd ra&s;cal, he received a blow from a bludgeon, dealt by the blood-hound keeper, which levelled him with the earth.</P>
<P>Never did my heart feel a twinge
<PB N="189" REF="191">
like that moment! I thought he was dead! He lay motionle&s;s; notwith&s;tand|ing which the infernal keeper continued his occupation with unconcern, turned the unre&s;i&s;ting body over, &s;lipped on the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, and bound down his arms.</P>
<P>At length he gave a groan! The in|&s;tant I heard it I galloped off, full &s;peed. It was too much for heart to endure!</P>
<P>I &s;oon afterward heard him &s;hout for aid more than once, but to this they pre&s;ently put a &s;top, by forcing a gag into his mouth. They were not very far di&s;tant from the hou&s;e where he was to be confined, and to which he was immediately hurried away.</P>
<P>There he at pre&s;ent remains. His morning dialogues, his noon-day walks,
<PB N="190" REF="192">
and his nightly raptures are ended. They are things pa&s;t, never more to return! Of that torment at lea&s;t I have rid my&s;elf; and others compared to that are bli&s;s ineffable! I had &s;worn it &s;hould not be! They might have read the oath largely written on my brow, and ought in&s;tinctively to have known it to be the decree of fate!</P>
<P>No, Fairfax! I never a&s;ked a favour from him; never by my own con&s;ent received one! Not all the tortures of all the tyrants the earth ever beheld &s;hould have extorted a con&s;ent &s;o de|grading! His repeated interference was but a repetition of in&s;ult, and as &s;uch de|&s;erves only to be remembered. I a&s;ked not life at his hands; and giving life, in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, he did but give
<PB N="191" REF="193">
torture! The gift was dete&s;table and the giver! Had I peri&s;hed, he might have been &s;afe and I at re&s;t. I a&s;ked not charity of him. No! On any terms I abhor exi&s;tence; but on tho&s;e, darkne&s;s and hell are not &s;o hateful! It has ulcerated my heart, which not even vengeance it&s;elf I find has now the power to heal. For life I am made mi|&s;erable; but it &s;hall not be a &s;ingle mi|&s;ery!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>While the keeper was acting his part of this gloomy drama, Mac Fane, as you may well imagine, was not idle. He and his unhallowed &s;coundrels pre|&s;ently made &s;eizure of the lovely Anna.
<PB N="192" REF="194">
She &s;tood confu&s;ed and half terrified at the &s;udden flight of her enamorato! She was more confu&s;ed, more terrified at the &s;udden appearance of her ravi&s;hers! I charged the &s;coundrels on their lives to u&s;e her tenderly! But what know &s;uch hell-hounds of tenderne&s;s?</P>
<P>She made I find a brave and by them unexpected re&s;i&s;tance: but there were too many of them, and it was in vain! Mac Fane him&s;elf is amazed at her beauty; and harangues in his coar&s;e and uncouth jargon on the energy and dignity of her deportment, in a man|ner which &s;hews that even he was awed.</P>
<P>They were obliged however forcibly to &s;top her cries. This I imagined would be the ca&s;e, and I had provided
<PB N="193" REF="195">
them with a white cambric handker|chief. But what will not the touch of &s;uch uncon&s;ecrated ra&s;cals defile?</P>
<P>Yes, Fair&s;ax, they laid their pro|phane hands on her, cla&s;ped her in their loath&s;ome arms, polluted her with their foul fingers! The embrace of a Clifton &s;he might perhaps pardon; but this vi|olation &s;he never can!</P>
<P>Well then, let her add this injury to the re&s;t! I know her to be my enemy; &s;worn, rooted, and irrevocable! And why &s;hould I tag regret to my &s;um of wretchedne&s;s? No! I will at lea&s;t en|joy a moment of triumph, however tran|&s;itory! Let her de&s;pi&s;e me, but &s;he &s;hall remember me too!</P>
<P>Give me but this brief bli&s;s, and there I would wi&s;h exi&s;tence to end! That
<PB N="194" REF="196">
excepted, plea&s;ure there is none for me; and of pain I am weary. Yes! I will glut my &s;oul with this &s;olitary, &s;hort rapture; and contemn the &s;torms that may &s;ucceed! I fear them not, &s;hall glory in them, and be glad to find foes, if &s;uch &s;hould ari&s;e, with whom conten|tion will not be di&s;grace! I wi&s;h and &s;eek them.

<P>ALARM has &s;ounded her horn. The family is all confu&s;ion, all doubt, hurry, fruitle&s;s enquiry, and indeci&s;ion. The ab&s;ence of Anna and Henley at dinner threw Mrs. Clarke into con&s;ter|nation; for Sir Arthur is down at Wen|bourne-Hill, with old Henley and his
<PB N="196" REF="198">
&s;on Edward. Each is indulging his dreams of improvement, marriage, dock|ing of entails, and other projects, to which I have put an eternal &s;top.</P>
<P>Finding the evening advance, and that the two pri&s;oners did not appear, the hou&s;ekeeper &s;ent to the aunt, Wen|bourne. She heard the &s;tory and was amazed. She knew nothing of them.</P>
<P>Ten o'clock came, and terror in|crea&s;ed. A me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to Lord Fitz-Allen; and he could not at fir&s;t tell whether to be &s;orry or glad, for he did not an in&s;tant forget to hope that it was &s;ome ra&s;cally act on the part of Henley.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for the hou&s;ekeeper. She came, and he interrogated her. The an&s;wers &s;he gave did not plea&s;e him, for
<PB N="197" REF="199">
the tendency of all his que&s;tions was to the di&s;advantage and crimination of Henley, whom &s;he pertinaciou&s;ly de|fended. She affirmed &s;o po&s;itively, and &s;o violently, that it could not be any plan or evil intention of his, that the proud lord was half angry but half obliged to doubt.</P>
<P>I took care to be in the way, expect|ing as it happened that a me&s;&s;age would be &s;ent to me. I immediately attended his lord&s;hip, and learned all that I have been relating. I condoled with him, and pretended to pity the family; not neglecting to lead his thoughts into the channel that would be&s;t &s;erve my purpo&s;e, and to recapitulate every circum&s;tance I could remember, or invent, that &s;hould induce him to believe Henley and Anna had eloped; but affecting candour, and
<PB N="198" REF="200">
pretending to argue again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The effect I intended was produced. He was fully convinced of Henley's being a low, &s;elfi&s;h, contemptible &s;coun|drel; and Anna a forward, di&s;obedient, in&s;olent mi&s;s.</P>
<P>I offered my &s;ervices to pur&s;ue them, and pre&s;&s;ed his acceptance of them vio|lently; but was careful to counteract the offer, by &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of their being overtaken, and by exciting him rather to wi&s;h for their e&s;cape, that Anna might be flagrantly di&s;graced, and his penetration and authority vindicated to the whole world.</P>
<P>I did not neglect, before the departure of Mrs. Clarke, to di&s;play all my eager|ne&s;s, by &s;ending round to numerous
<PB N="199" REF="201">
inns and &s;table-keepers, to enquire whe|ther any po&s;t-chai&s;e had been hired, that &s;hould any way accord with the circum|&s;tances. Other me&s;&s;engers were di&s;|patched, by my advice, to the different turnpikes; and a third &s;et &s;ent off to various watch-hou&s;es, to enquire whe|ther any intelligence could be obtained of accidental deaths, or other mi&s;chances.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I was very diligent to hurry the legs of the &s;ervants and the brains of their governors into every direction, but the right; and thus for a little while in &s;ome &s;ort diverted my&s;elf, with the vagaries of the fools upon whom I was playing. One chop-fallen runner trod upon the heels of another, each with a repetition of his diver&s;ified nothings; till his lord&s;hip thought proper to recol|lect
<PB N="200" REF="202">
it was time for his dignity to retire, and not further di&s;turb it&s;elf on per|&s;onages and circum&s;tances &s;o derogatory.</P>
<P>In the morning I was careful to be with him again. I breakfa&s;ted with him, and reiterated the &s;ame &s;tring of doubts, conjectures, alarms, and in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clarke returned. She had been up all night, and her looks te&s;tified the di&s;tre&s;s of her mind. She propo&s;ed &s;ending an expre&s;s after Sir Arthur; of the propriety of which I endeavoured to make the uncle doubt; but &s;he was too zealous, and her oratory had too much pa&s;&s;ion, to be counteracted without dan|ger. I therefore, when I &s;aw re&s;i&s;tance vain, became the mo&s;t eager advi&s;er of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>There is no merit in impo&s;ing upon
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;tupidity &s;o gro&s;s as that of this &s;uperci|lious blockhead. Mrs. Clarke would be much more to be feared, but that what &s;he may &s;ay will be much le&s;s re|garded. Her affection for Anna is ex|treme, and a high proof of the excellent qualities of her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor was &s;he one whit le&s;s enthu&s;ia&s;tic in her prai&s;e of Henley. Notwith|&s;tanding the forbidding frowns and re|proofs of his lord&s;hip, &s;he ran over his whole hi&s;tory; and dwelt particularly on an act of benevolence done by him to her niece; that being a circum&s;tance that had come immediately within her know|ledge. She &s;poke with &s;uch a fervour and overflow of heart that &s;he once or twice moved me.</P>
<P>She perceived &s;omething of the ridi|culous
<PB N="202" REF="204">
compunction I felt, and fell on her knees, wrung my hand, and adjured me, in a tone of very extraordinary em|pha&s;is, to &s;ave her dear her precious young lady. I &s;carcely could recover my&s;elf &s;ufficiently to a&s;k her which way it was in my power to &s;ave her; and to turn the conver&s;ation, by exclaiming to the peer&mdash;<Q>Ah! Had &s;he but allowed me the happine&s;s and honour of being her protector, I think no man would have dared to do her harm.</Q></P>
<P>The old hou&s;ekeeper however con|tinued, and began to denounce impend|ing and inevitable evil on the per&s;ecutors of Henley and Anna. I have no doubt &s;he glanced at me, and that her mi&s;tre&s;s had informed her of the triumph gained over me. Why ay! I &s;hould indeed
<PB N="203" REF="205">
have been the &s;coff of the very rabble, had I not taken vengeance for my wrongs!</P>
<P>Yet her denunciations &s;eemed pro|phetic: or rather were feeble de&s;crip|tions of the excruciating pangs by which I am hourly gnawn!</P>
<P>I grew weary of the dull farce, and put an end to it as &s;peedily as I conve|niently could; leaving his &s;age lord&s;hip with the full conviction that the &s;udden di&s;appearance of Henley, and his niece, could no otherwi&s;e be accounted for but by wilful elopement.</P>
<P>I am now preparing for a very dif|ferent vi&s;it. A vi&s;it of vengeance! I expect no plea&s;ure, no gratification but that alone! To prove the danger of in|jury done to me, to puni&s;h the perpe|trators,
<PB N="204" REF="206">
to exult at their lamentations, and to look down with contempt at all menace, or retribution, is now my la&s;t remaining hope! Let me but enjoy this and all other expectation I willingly re|linqui&s;h!&mdash;I am going&mdash;I have them in my gra&s;p!&mdash;They &s;hall feel me now!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE I am, what is to become of me, or whether I am ever to &s;ee my Loui&s;a more, are things of which I am utterly ignorant. I write not with an expectation that my friend &s;hould read, but to memorandum events of which perhaps the world will never hear; and
<PB N="206" REF="208">
which, &s;hould this paper by any acci|dent be pre&s;erved, it will &s;carcely be|lieve.</P>
<P>This vile Clifton&mdash;[Surely I ought never again to call him my Loui&s;a's brother]&mdash;This perver&s;e man has grown de&s;perate in error! The wor&s;t of my forebodings have not equalled his in|tents! His plan has long been mi&s;|chief! Hypocri&s;y, violence, rape, no means are too foul!&mdash;Such things are incomprehen&s;ible!</P>
<P>I am confined in a lone hou&s;e, &s;ome|where behind Knight&s;bridge. I was &s;eized I know not how by a band of ruffians, and conveyed hither. Every kind of de&s;picable deceit appears to have been practi&s;ed. Frank was decoyed from me. He flew once again to &s;ave
<PB N="207" REF="209">
the life, as he thought, of this ba&s;e minded man. I know not what is be|come of him, but have no doubt that he like me is &s;omewhere &s;uffering im|pri&s;onment, if he be permitted yet to live.</P>
<P>No thoughts are &s;o tragical, no &s;u&s;|picions &s;o horrid as not to be ju&s;tified, by deductions and appearances which are but too probable. Yet I will not &s;ink under difficulties, nor be appalled at the &s;ight of danger; be it death, or what el&s;e it may. That I am in a &s;tate of jeopardy my &s;eizure and impri&s;on|ment prove. That Frank is &s;till in greater peril, if &s;till in exi&s;tence, I have ju&s;t cau&s;e to conclude. There were pi&s;|tols fired, and one after he leaped the hedge; I know not at whom directed,
<PB N="208" REF="210">
nor what its fate!&mdash;I would if po&s;&s;ible ward off apprehen&s;ion. I know it to be folly, and I will endeavour to &s;teel my heart again&s;t this as well as other mi&s;|takes. If he be dead, or if he be to die, grief will not revive or make him invul|nerable. His own virtue mu&s;t pre&s;erve him, or nothing can; and in that I will confide.</P>
<P>That evil is meant to me it would be ab&s;urd to doubt; but of what nature, where it is to begin, or where end, that time mu&s;t di&s;clo&s;e. For I will not per|mit my&s;elf to imagine the trifling indig|nities, or violence I have hitherto en|countered, an evil worthy of com|plaint.</P>
<P>'Tis true my arms are brui&s;ed, and I was rudely dealt with by the vile men
<PB N="209" REF="211" MS="y">
who &s;eized me: and that there &s;hould be &s;uch men is an evil. But to me it is none; or not worth a thought. If I would firmly meet what is to come, I mu&s;t not weakly bewail what is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I am not immortal, neither is my &s;trength infinite; but the powers I have I will u&s;e. We are oftener vanqui&s;hed becau&s;e we are fearful than becau&s;e we are feeble. Our debility takes birth in our cowardice, and true fortitude is not to be aba&s;hed by trifling dan|gers.</P>
<P>I meant to write a narrative, but the&s;e reflections are forced upon me by my &s;ituation. I will proceed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="210" REF="212">
<P>I was brought here, on Friday *****, by &s;everal men of vulgar but ferocious countenances; and my maid Laura with me. I made all the re&s;i&s;tance in my power; and the men, without any regard to what I &s;uffered in body or mind, twi&s;ted my arms behind me, &s;o that I imagined one of them had been di&s;lo|cated, and forced a handkerchief into my mouth; handling, to&s;&s;ing, and grip|ing me, without any re&s;pect whatever to decency or pain, till they had conveyed me from the fields, in which I was walking with Frank Henley, to the place where I am.</P>
<P>I &s;carcely can gue&s;s at the di&s;tance; but they hurried me away with great violence, cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal gates, and forcing apertures through hedges, for
<PB N="211" REF="213">
the &s;pace I believe of not more than half an hour: it might be much le&s;s.</P>
<P>They brought me to a hou&s;e walled round; into which having been admitted by an old woman, they hurried me for|ward up &s;tairs, and &s;hut me into a room decently furni&s;hed, with a fire in it and a bed-chamber adjoining; but with the windows barred up, and in which every precaution had evidently been taken to render e&s;cape impracticable.</P>
<P>Laura was &s;hut up with me; and there was a &s;lip of paper on the table, on which was written&mdash;<Q>Laura is allowed to fetch whatever you may want. Let her ring the bell, and the door will be opened.</Q>&mdash;The hand-writing was Mr. Clifton's.</P>
<P>Among other nece&s;&s;aries, there was a
<PB N="212" REF="214">
book-ca&s;e, furni&s;hed with the works of &s;ome of the be&s;t authors; and a writing|de&s;k, with pens, ink, and paper.</P>
<P>The &s;ame old woman that opened the gate for the men, who brought me, con&s;tantly comes to open the door for Laura, when I ring. But this &s;he does with great caution. A chain, &s;imilar to what is common for &s;treet-doors, is hung on the out&s;ide; which &s;he puts up, and looks to &s;ee that I am not near, every time &s;he opens the door. The fir&s;t time &s;he came I &s;tood ju&s;t behind Laura, and in a moro&s;e tone &s;he bade me go back, or &s;he would lock the door again.</P>
<P>After Laura had been &s;everal times down &s;tairs, I enquired what di&s;coveries &s;he had made; and, as &s;he informs me,
<PB N="213" REF="215">
the hou&s;e appears to have no inhabitants but this old woman and our&s;elves. The old woman re&s;ides in the kitchen. The doors and windows are all &s;ecured; and the &s;ame care is taken to prevent e&s;cape below &s;tairs as above.</P>
<P>The food that has been brought us was good, and well dre&s;&s;ed, but almo&s;t cold. Laura &s;ays &s;he is &s;ure it cannot be dre&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e, which is mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>I communicate but few of my thoughts to Laura, becau&s;e I fear I have good rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;picious of her. I have long remarked her partiality in favour of Mr. Clifton, intermixed with &s;ome contradictory appearances, which I could not &s;olve at the time, but which I now believe to have been aukward attempts
<PB N="214" REF="216">
to conceal that partiality, and to mi&s;|lead me; which &s;he in part effected.</P>
<P>The ba&s;e de&s;igns of Mr. Clifton, from the nature of them, cannot have been very recent; and nothing perhaps was more nece&s;&s;ary, to carry them into exe|cution, than the &s;educing of the wo|man who by her &s;ituation could give him the be&s;t intelligence.</P>
<P>Since I have begun to doubt her, I have purpo&s;ely cro&s;s-que&s;tioned her oc|ca&s;ionally, and &s;he has an&s;wered with he|&s;itation and incoherency. If however I can perceive the lea&s;t hope that this let|ter &s;hould be conveyed to the po&s;t-office, by any per&s;on who may vi&s;it the hou&s;e, and whom &s;he may &s;ee but I cannot, I will tru&s;t it to her. The tru&s;t indeed is nothing, for it cannot increa&s;e my
<PB N="215" REF="217">
peril. The per&s;ecution of Mr. Clifton mu&s;t prove mo&s;t pernicious to him&s;elf. Unle&s;s he can deprive me of con&s;cious innocence, it can injure me but little.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Among other ambiguous circum|&s;tances re&s;pecting Laura, &s;he &s;carcely &s;eems to repine at her confinement: though &s;he has &s;everal times affected un|ea&s;ine&s;s, which while &s;he acted it &s;he evi|dently did not feel. Be&s;ide &s;he is per|mitted to &s;tay below, and run about the hou&s;e; which, whatever caution of bars and bolts may have been u&s;ed, &s;he would not be &s;uffered to do, as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, were &s;he really in my inte|re&s;t.</P>
<P>About an hour ago we heard the yard
<PB N="216" REF="218">
bell ring and the gate open, and &s;he was eager to go down. I encouraged her, and &s;he rung for our turnkey. She had &s;een me writing, and, without being &s;poken to, took upon her to &s;uppo&s;e it was a letter to my Loui&s;a, and told me &s;he <HI>did believe</HI> &s;he could get it con|veyed to the po&s;t. I am per&s;uaded this is preconcerted officiou&s;ne&s;s. But as I &s;aid, I have nothing to lo&s;e, and there is a bare po&s;&s;ibility of hope.</P>
<P>When &s;he came up &s;tairs again, &s;he told me that the per&s;on who had rung at the bell was &s;ome man of the neigh|bourhood, who had brought the old woman various trifling articles, and whom &s;he had ordered to return at five o'clock, with tea and &s;ugar.</P>
<P>If contrary to all expectation this
<PB N="217" REF="219">
&s;hould come to hand, Loui&s;a, write to my father; inform him of all you know: and e&s;pecially write to Mr. Clifton. It will be ineffectual, but write. If there be truth in woman, I would rejoice to &s;uffer much more mi&s;|chief than he has the power to inflict, could I but by that means re&s;tore him to a &s;en&s;e of his own worth; or rather of the worth of virtue!</P>
<P>Why do I talk of mi&s;chief, and his power to inflict? I hope to &s;hew him he has no power over me; and that the &s;trength of men, and the force of walls, locks, and bars are feeble, when but re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed by the force of truth, actuating the will of weak and de&s;pi&s;ed woman!&mdash;Injury?&mdash;Poor depraved, mi&s;taken man! It is him&s;elf he injures!
<PB N="218" REF="220">
Every effort he makes is but a new a&s;|&s;ault upon his own peace! It is heaping coals of fire upon his own head; which it has long been the wi&s;h of my heart to ex&s;tingui&s;h!</P>
<P>Had I but any rea&s;on to believe Frank Henley in &s;afety, I would not &s;uffer a &s;ingle &s;igh to e&s;cape me. But I know too well Mr Clifton dare not permit him to be at liberty, while he keeps me confined. Surely nothing can be attempted again&s;t his life? And yet I &s;ometimes &s;hake with horror! There is a rea&s;on which I know not whether I dare mention; yet if Mr. Clifton &s;hould think proper to lay &s;nares to in|tercept and read my letters, he ought to be informed of this dangerous circum|&s;tance. I know not, Loui&s;a, whether
<PB N="219" REF="221">
I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you or him; but Frank Henley at the time that I was &s;eized, and he likewi&s;e as I &s;uppo&s;e, had bank-bills in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the amount of eight thou&s;and pounds!</P>
<P>He had been that very morning into the city, to receive the money on his father's account; and intended as we returned to leave them with Sir Arthur's banker.</P>
<P>If men &s;uch as tho&s;e who &s;eized on me were employed for the &s;ame violent purpo&s;e again&s;t him, and if they &s;hould di&s;cover a &s;um which would to them be &s;o tempting, who can &s;ay that his life would be &s;afe? Frank Henley, the pre&s;erver of Clifton, the preceptor of truth, and the friend of man; the bene|volent, magnanimous, noble-minded
<PB N="220" REF="222">
Frank, who&s;e actions were uniform in goodne&s;s, who&s;e heart was all affection, and who&s;e &s;oul all light&mdash;and mur|dered!</P>
<P>Why do I indulge a thought &s;o un|human, &s;o impo&s;&s;ible? It could not be!&mdash;No, no; it could not be! A &s;uppo&s;ition &s;o extravagant is guilt&mdash;Yet though I who cannot aid him ought not to encourage &s;uch doubts, let tho&s;e who can be warned, and be active!</P>
<P>I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to vacancy! No one hears me! No one will read what I write!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I will be calm. It is my &s;ituation, it is confinement, the bars I &s;ee and the bolts I hear that in&s;pire the&s;e gloomy

Hurrying, enquiring, de&s;pairing, and di&s;tracted; in much deeper di&s;tre&s;s than I am: for were I but &s;ure of his &s;afety, I could almo&s;t defy misfortune! Let not the world lo&s;e him! Oh! If any human creature &s;hould in time read this, let him hear, let him &s;hudder, let him beware!</P>
<P>Pardon, Loui&s;a! I do not addre&s;s my&s;elf to you! Too well I know my friend to doubt her! No cold delay, no unfeeling negligence, no ra&s;h phren&s;y is to be feared from her!&mdash;Alas! What I am writing &s;he will never read! It cannot be! The man I have to encounter is too practi&s;ed in deceit,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
or I &s;hould not have been where I am!</P>
<P>Well then, may he him&s;elf read! And while he reads, thus let his con|&s;cience &s;peak&mdash;<Q>There is a man who&s;e worth and virtues are &s;uch, that the lo&s;s of him would be a lo&s;s to the whole human race. From this man I received a thou&s;and acts of kind|ne&s;s: for which I returned ten thou|&s;and in&s;ults. I repul&s;ed him, &s;corned him, &s;truck him; and he, di&s;regard|ing the innumerable injuries I had done him, but a few hours after plunged headlong down the dreadful aby&s;s, to &s;natch me from the grave. I was dead and he gave me life. In return I have robbed him of what men prize even more than life, of

liberty. But if I have put him in jeopardy, if I &s;uffer him to remain in the power of hardened and wicked men, and if he peri&s;h, mercy can|not pardon me, ju&s;tice cannot puni&s;h, and charity it&s;elf mu&s;t hold me in abhorrence.</Q></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Dover-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY actions are now become one continued chain of artifice. But were that all, and were not the objects of this artifice of a nature &s;o new and &s;o pain|ful, it would afford me amu&s;ement, and not be any cau&s;e of vexation.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">
As it is I feel apprehen&s;ions which are wholly different from any I ever felt before. To deceive in countries where deception is a pa&s;time, authori&s;ed, prac|ti&s;ed, and applauded, is I find &s;ome|thing very oppo&s;ite to what would &s;eem the &s;ame thing, in this gloomy land of apathy and phlegm. There it is a &s;port and a plea&s;ure. Here it is a bu&s;i|ne&s;s of &s;erious danger and general dete&s;|tation. But no matter!</P>
<P>I am obliged to watch times and &s;ea|&s;ons, for I have little doubt that I my|&s;elf am watched. That old hou&s;ekeeper I am &s;ure &s;u&s;pects me; and her affection for her mi&s;tre&s;s is &s;o full, &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, that it cannot but &s;harpen her intellects, and make her employ every engine &s;he can imagine for di&s;covery. I walked up to
<PB N="226" REF="228">
Fozard's as I often do for my hor&s;e, and I &s;aw one of Sir Arthur's &s;ervants pa&s;s the yard, &s;oon after I entered it. I have little doubt but he was dogging me.</P>
<P>I got on hor&s;eback and rode &s;lowly down toward Pimlico, and over We&s;t|min&s;ter bridge, but I &s;aw no more of him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was out of town I mend|ed my pace, and gradually increa&s;ed it to a full gallop. Pa&s;&s;ing through Vaux|hall, I cro&s;&s;ed the Thames again at Batter&s;ea-bridge, rode through Chel|&s;ea, and pre&s;ently gained the Brompton road.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t vi&s;it was to the keeper. The fellow has a &s;trange look! A vil|lainous phy&s;iognomy! I enquired after
<PB N="227" REF="229">
his pri&s;oner and found he was &s;afe. The hou&s;e is well &s;ecured; not modern, but in the &s;tyle of the la&s;t century; &s;trong and heavy, and before this affair was thought of had been fitted up for the purpo&s;es of confinement, but is now &s;till better fortified. It has a garden, which is &s;urrounded by a high wall, in which the pri&s;oner is &s;uffered to exerci&s;e him|&s;elf; but not without the very nece&s;&s;ary precaution of confining his arms in the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, &s;ecuring the doors, and attentively watching his motions.</P>
<P>I ordered the fellow to &s;ee that Hen|ley wanted for nothing, to let a boy he has wait upon him, and to keep out of his way him&s;elf, for two rea&s;ons of my own. I do not wi&s;h Henley to &s;uffer the in&s;ults of &s;uch a vulgar and narrow|&s;ouled
<PB N="228" REF="230">
ra&s;cal: my revenge is of a nobler kind. Neither am I quite certain that this keeper, hardened, obdurate, and pitile&s;s as he is, could with&s;tand Hen|ley's oratory. At lea&s;t I would not willingly have him &s;ubjected to the temptation: though the fellow is &s;o aver&s;e to any &s;en&s;e of human pity that I think the danger is very &s;mall.</P>
<P>He was offended however at my thinking proper to direct him, and &s;ur|lily told me he under&s;tood his trade.</P>
<P>Here I met Mac Fane, by appoint|ment. He cannot forget the di&s;grace of Covent-garden, and &s;poke of Henley with a degree of malignity that would want but little encourageing to become dangerous. I am to pay him the thou|&s;and pounds in a few days, and our
<PB N="229" REF="231">
place of rendezvous is then to be once more at the Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>I was glad to e&s;cape from the com|pany of the&s;e new inmates of mine, the&s;e fir&s;t-born of Beelzebub, and to fly to my other pri&s;oner. I &s;ay fly, for I &s;et out with eagerne&s;s enough; but every &s;tep I took I felt my ardour abate. The hou&s;es are more than half a mile apart, and I thought proper to go thither on foot, and not to take any common path, but to cro&s;s the fields, as the &s;ecure&s;t mode.</P>
<P>Laura knew I was to be there, and had her tale ready. She pre&s;ently came down. I enquired after her mi&s;tre&s;s, and if her account be true, this heroic woman has not &s;hed a tear, but has be|haved
<PB N="230" REF="232">
with all her apparent cu&s;tomary calm. She is a divine creature!</P>
<P>As I rode along, I made a thou&s;and determinations that all &s;hould be that day ended. I cur&s;ed my&s;elf, pledged my honour, u&s;ed every method which might have &s;hewn me how much I doubted my own re&s;olution, to prove to my&s;elf how irrevocably determined I was! The little remaining firmne&s;s I had left wholly died away at the rela|tion of Laura.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;tay till the calm dignity of her mind &s;hall begin to decline. The nature of her confinement, the fears &s;he cannot but have for her Henley, the recollection of her friends and father, and her apprehen&s;ions of me mu&s;t all
<PB N="231" REF="233">
quickly contribute to produce this effect.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to deny that I feel a reluctance to a fir&s;t interview: but I am determined the fir&s;t &s;hall be the only one. I know my&s;elf, and know when once I am heated it will not then be Anna St. Ives, a miracle though &s;he be, that can over-awe or conquer me. I have the &s;tubbornne&s;s of woman, and the &s;trength of man. I am reck|le&s;s of what is to follow, but the thing &s;hall be! There is not a particl&egrave; in my frame that does not &s;tand pledged to the deed, by honour and oath! It is the only event for which I care, or for which I live.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I live long when once it is over. I fore&s;ee I &s;hall not. But that
<PB N="232" REF="234">
is not a painful, no, it is a &s;atisfactory thought! I would even pre&s;ent her the pi&s;tol, would &s;he but di&s;patch me the mo|ment my revenge is gratified. I would then &s;leep, and forget all that is, and all that might have been.</P>
<P>She has been writing. I knew it would be one &s;ource of amu&s;ement to her, and I provided her with imple|ments. Laura a&s;ked and &s;he owned it was a letter to my &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he could wi&s;h were &s;ent. But that mu&s;t not be. She means to give it to Laura; I of cour&s;e &s;hall be the next receiver.</P>
<P>This girl, Laura, acts her part ill. She is not half &s;orrowful enough. I wonder Anna does not remark it; and Laura &s;ays &s;he does not, though that is no very good proof. The complexion
<PB N="233" REF="235">
of her letter I think will tell me how far &s;he does or does not confide in her maid. I know &s;he holds &s;u&s;picion in contempt; and yet I think my high opinion of her di&s;crimination would find &s;ome abatement, were I certain that &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect this &s;hallow girl.</P>
<P>My &s;oul burns to have it over! And yet like a coward I refrain. But I will not long &s;ubmit to &s;uch contemptible qualms. I will not continue to be diffi|dent of my&s;elf; for it is that only by which I am withheld. Not a &s;ingle wrong is forgotten! I repeat them in my &s;leep! Ay, Fairfax, &s;uch &s;leep as I have is nothing but a repetition of them; and a rehear&s;al of the revenge by which they are to be appea&s;ed! I will return to|morrow,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
or perhaps next day; and then&mdash;! You &s;hall then hear more from</P>
