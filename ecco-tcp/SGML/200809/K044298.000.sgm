<HEAD>A Scot&s;man's Remarks, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT any o&s;tentatious di&s;play of the origin of <HI>Comedy</HI> or <HI>Farce,</HI> as is but too u&s;ual among pro&s;e&s;&s;ed pamphleteers, I &s;hall confine this critici&s;m &s;olely to the piece in que&s;tion, <HI>Love &agrave; la Mode.</HI></P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of it, in the &s;en&s;e of Ho|race, is a &s;ubject <HI>publici juris,</HI> a common and obvious one to all writers, and will remain &s;o to the end of time; to wit, a young lady's being courted by a number of contra&s;ted lovers, who&s;e characters, from their di&s;cordance with each other, are to furni&s;h out the comic enter|tainment.</P>
<P>Of this kind we have &s;everal on the Engli&s;h, be&s;ides tho&s;e on other theatres
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of Europe; viz. MISS LUCY IN TOWN, MISS IN HER TEENS, &amp;C.</P>
<P>And yet an author may derive merit from this &s;ubject of <HI>common right,</HI> as we may call it, in proportion as he &s;hall in|troduce per&s;onages of an higher rank of life, more elegant colouring, and a quite novel complexion.</P>
<P>Whenever this &s;hall be executed, it is to be looked upon as the work of true ge|nius; but when fallen &s;hort of, as often happens, it is to be deemed the impotent effort of the hard-bound brains of low pla|giaries, who&s;e memory is filled with the &s;hreds and ill-cho&s;en &s;craps of other mens wit.</P>
<P>In which of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es the author of <HI>Love &agrave; la Mode</HI> is to be ranked, will appear from the &s;ub&s;equent remarks; whom, however, the mo&s;t inveterate ene|mies he has, cannot refu&s;e being guilty of <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>gratitude</HI> on this occa&s;ion&mdash;Of <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> in not <HI>publi&s;hing</HI>; and of <HI>gratitude</HI> in not giving his generous benefactors oc|ca&s;ion of repenting their having patronized &s;uch coar&s;e, inaccurate &s;cenes, and &s;o af|frontful to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
To proceed methodically, let us <HI>fir&s;t</HI> examine into the propriety of the cha|racters of his drama; and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> how he has conducted the whole, and how brought on and carried off his people.</P>
<P>The DRAMATIS PERSONAE are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Sir THEODORE GOODCHILD, a wealthy merchant of London.</ITEM>
<ITEM>MORDECAI, a wealthy Jew fop.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir ARCHIBALD M'SARCASM, a Scotch knight.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir CALLAGHAN O BRALLAGHAN, an Iri&s;h officer in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>GROOME, an Engli&s;h e&s;quire, fond of race-hor&s;es, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHARLOTTE, a young lady of a con|&s;iderable fortune, and the ward of Sir <HI>Theodore.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Propriety of characters, for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, may be divided into two &s;orts&mdash; The one to make them act and &s;peak in every thing &s;uitably to their intended pur|po&s;e, untainted by any peculiarly vicious manner of country or education.&mdash;The other is, when the character is made to
<PB N="4" REF="6">
re&s;ult intirely from a provincial dialect, and local manners.</P>
<P>The chief mongrel characters of this farce are a mon&s;trous compound of both. There is nothing merely national in either the <HI>Scotch</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> man, but an apeing of the vulgar accent of both-nations, with a few &s;trained (not natural) blunders in the <HI>Hibernian</HI> hero's mouth, &s;ince &s;uch the author has been plea&s;ed to con&s;titute him.</P>
<P>The character of <HI>M' Sarca&s;m</HI> is &s;ome|what of <HI>Rancune</HI>'s ca&s;t in the comic ro|mance written by the facetious <HI>Scarron.</HI>&mdash; He is a ra&s;cal in every &s;en&s;e, who delights in flattering all pre&s;ent, man or woman, to his or her face, &s;hrugging contempt at them at the &s;ame time, when they turn their backs, and tearing them to pieces when ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>This character is the produce of every climate; and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in general, if we take their own words for it (I mean no national reflection, for that I &s;corn) implead them|&s;elves for a too general tendency to de|traction, and to the fir&s;t comer; whereas the <HI>Scots,</HI> are very cautious to whom they)
<PB N="5" REF="7">
di&s;clo&s;e their di&s;advantageous opinions of any per&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Callaghan O Brallaghan</HI> is made a Pru&s;&s;ian officer, to introduce him under that pa&s;&s;port more favourably to the crowd, If the author had cho&s;en it, he might with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> much ju&s;tice, and perhaps more, have in|troduced a <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> in that &s;ervice, there being no corps of either nation in it, as in <HI>France</HI>; and that moreover there was in favour of the <HI>North Briton,</HI> his brave countryman general <HI>Keith,</HI> who had long &s;hared the favour, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the councils, and ultimately fallen in the &s;ervice of Pru&s;&s;ia's ever-glorious monarch.</P>
<P>It &s;ure then ill becomes any a&s;&s;umed character of officer&s;hip in that heroic &s;er|vice, to &s;quint the lea&s;t, however indi|rectly, again&s;t <HI>Scotch</HI> valour, which is im|pudently done more than once in this farce.</P>
<P>An <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> officer in the <HI>French, Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> &s;ervice, would have been more agreeable to the general received notions of mankind. But &s;uch an incoherent med|ley of heroi&s;m and &s;tupidity as <HI>O Brallag|han</HI> is di&s;hed out here by his countryman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver has been exhibited before, nor ought
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to be borne by any audience that would lay a claim to rationality.</P>
<P><HI>Mordecai</HI> the beau Jew is no-body, a mere expletive foot-ball per&s;ona, to be made a cat's paw of, to be abu&s;ed, in|&s;ulted, and have jokes cracked upon him.</P>
<P>Squire <HI>Groome</HI> is no national characte|ri&s;tic of England, but a general repre&s;en|tative of any per&s;on of the three king|doms, who likes hor&s;e-racing, drinking, &amp;c. preferably to any other happine&s;s; but why he &s;hould be the type of the Engli&s;h nation, I cannot &s;ee, and therefore leave it to the very jumbling author to explain in the be&s;t manner he can; for objects receive &s;trange a&s;pects, as they pa&s;s through the <HI>camera ob&s;cura</HI> of his in|tellect.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Theodore Goodchild,</HI> as well as his ward <HI>Charlotte,</HI> are two very &s;illy &s;chemers, con&s;idering how the world is at pre&s;ent &s;ituated, and that all marriages are rather the objects of prudence than pa&s;&s;ion. We are not <HI>Arcadian</HI> &s;hepherds either in this or the next <HI>i&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>As I am but lately come from Scotland, the fir&s;t view I had of <HI>Love &agrave; la Mode</HI> was
<PB N="7" REF="9">
on Saturday &s;e'nnight, when a young gen|tleman who &s;at near me in the pit, was plea&s;ed to inform me that it had been much &s;hortened, and altered for the better &s;ince the fir&s;t performance of it. That, moreover, it u&s;ed at fir&s;t to be preceded by a plaintive prologue, &s;poken, as was &s;up|po&s;ed, by a water-nymph, or one like <HI>Niob&eacute;,</HI> all tears, to deprecate the public's re&s;entment from the vile &s;tuff that was to, be pre&s;ented; nay, he added, it was not unlike a child's endeavouring with &s;obs and tears to conciliate the favour of an incen&s;ed public in the behalf of a sinful but repent|ing parent.</P>
<P>The piece opens by Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> and <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s having agreed to lay a &s;cheme to try which of her lovers was the mo&s;t &s;incere, by their declaring after dinner that he was a bankrupt, &amp;c. and &s;he ruined of con&s;equence.&mdash;A pretty amu&s;ement for a wealthy merchant, and an experiment that few young ladies of fortune ought to try now-a-days, however great their me|rit; nay, even granting that of their &s;uitor and his having &s;trong affections for them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
There are family rea&s;ons, &s;uch as the providing for the younger children, &amp;c. which would prove often in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles, where poverty &s;hould really be pre&s;ented in the place of an expected large fortune.</P>
<P>She gives to her guardian, as if he had neither known nor &s;een them before, a re&s;pective de&s;cription of her woers.&mdash;If it was meant to inform the audience, it is &s;tupid enough; that is like prefixing an explanatory argument to a play: their ap|pearance and bu&s;ine&s;s is to let the audi|ence into the &s;ecret of what they are; which accounts &s;hould ever be &s;hortly done, and to tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed not to have had any prior knowledge.</P>
<P>That given of the Jew beau <HI>Mordecai,</HI> as well as the treatment of him through-out, is idly and gro&s;ly in&s;ulting a body of people, &s;ince the Jew-act has not taken place, and who ought to meet with better treatment from a man who owed his get|ing any footing on the &s;tage to the &s;up|po&s;ition of his having well repre&s;ented one of their community.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
That given of <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> is partly al|ready hinted at, with his being vain-glo|rious of the antiquity of his family.</P>
<P>That of 'Squire <HI>Groome</HI> gives but a very faint idea of what the actor's excellence di&s;plays.</P>
<P>The picture drawn of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> hero is rather that of a bully than a brave officer; nor is either wrote up, nor con&s;equently acted up to. He is de&s;cribed with a high-cocked hat, long &s;word, &s;hort-&s;kirted coat, and affecting a tremendous &s;tride; to which the lady adds, <Q>You would think that <HI>Mars</HI> had been his fo&s;ter-father, and <HI>Bellona</HI> his nur&s;e, &amp;c.</Q> there needed only to have been added, that every morn|ing he drank gunpowder tea for his break-fa&s;t, and that he &s;wallowed pi&s;tol balls, <HI>like &s;ugar-plumbs,</HI> by way of helping di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>Yet when Sir <HI>Callaghan</HI> comes into ac|tion, both his language and demeanor are of the gentle&s;t ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> pretends bu&s;ine&s;s out, in order to give room for <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s receiv|ing all her lovers before dinner, to which
<PB N="10" REF="12">
they had been invited; and are expected, except 'Squire <HI>Groome,</HI> who was, it &s;eems, engaged in a great hor&s;e-match at New-market.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Theodore,</HI> on his going out, is met by the fir&s;t arrived vi&s;itor <HI>Mordecai,</HI> who enters rather like a ma&s;querade buffoon than any thing el&s;e, and di&s;gracing Italian airs like a lunatic <HI>ca&s;trato.</HI></P>
<P>After a few common-place compli|ments, he upon her beauty, &s;he upon his ta&s;te, elegance, &amp;c. &s;he accu&s;es him with addre&s;&s;ing a certain lady, &amp;c. he expre&s;&s;es great unea&s;ine&s;s to know from whom &s;he had learned it; &s;he tells him from <HI>M'Sar|ca&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Mordecai</HI> adds to the already di&s;|advantageous character given of the <HI>North Briton's,</HI> poi&s;onous tongue, by calling him the &s;candal &s;preader and Pa&s;quin of the town, and &s;ays he is &s;o great a &s;coundrel no gentleman of his country will keep him company.</P>
<P>This is but a poor &s;alvo&mdash;Why then impo&s;e all the &s;coundreli&s;m of the piece upon Scots &s;houlders? It certainly was by
<PB N="11" REF="13">
no means intended as a compliment, but rather as a gro&s;s affront to <HI>North Britain,</HI> as well as the weak de&s;igner could exe|cute it.</P>
<P><HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> comes into Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte's</HI> apartment, and though on an intended vi&s;it to her, &s;ees <HI>Mordecai</HI> before the lady (though why we are not told) in order it &s;eems to have a little fun with him&mdash;There is great art here!</P>
<P>He then turns to the lady, a&s;ks her pardon for not having &s;een her before (though &s;he was as obvious an object as then) in a very tire&s;ome, drawling, he&s;i|tating, repeating, and, on the whole, ex|ecrable imitation of the Scots accent, through which breaks out ever and anon the <HI>Iri&s;h brogue.</HI></P>
<P>Among other things in his very un|couth addre&s;s, he declares her to be "an epitome of all mentel and bo-de-ly per|fections, and that &s;he is a de-ve-ne-ty." Sir <HI>Callaghan O Brallaghan</HI>'s name being brought on the carpet, <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> bids them not to be unea&s;y about him, that he has brought him along with him; for C 2
<PB N="12" REF="14">
that, like the kings of old, he never tra|vels without his f-u-l; and that he has left him writing a love epi&s;tle below &s;tairs, which he is &s;ure has not been equalled &s;ince the days of Don <HI>Q-u-e-x-o-t-e</HI>&mdash; E&mdash;h!</P>
<P>He does not tell us in what apartment below &s;tairs he had left him. This gives a very contemptible idea of the author's hero, that by <HI>M'Sarca&s;m,</HI> a known rival's advice, he &s;hould mi&s;employ &s;o much time below &s;tairs in penning either a &s;o-net or an ep-i-&s;tle; while the other, during that interval, was making the mo&s;t of his &s;uit.</P>
<P><HI>Mordecai,</HI> de&s;irous to have a &s;lice, as they call it, of the <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> by way of a whet before dinner, goes off, and commodiou&s;ly, to give <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> an opportunity of abu|&s;ing all his rivals, which he does e-la-bo-rate-ly.</P>
<P>Squire <HI>Groome</HI> he repre&s;ents to her as a man of ruined fortune, a Newmarket &s;harper, a contemptible jo-key; who would always prefer his hor&s;es, &amp;c. to her.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
<HI>Mordecai,</HI> his favourite butt for abu&s;e, he vili&s;ies, among other things, for his complexion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> he bids her beware of on account of his being her guardian's ne|phew; whom he in&s;inuates to her he has certain information of having a de&s;ign upon her fortune.</P>
<P>He la&s;tly comes to him&s;elf, and then blazons forth to her the advantages that &s;he will have, though &s;prung from &s;ugar|hog&s;heads, rum-puncheons, a compting-hou&s;e, &amp;c. to be married into an a-nci-ent fe-mi-ly, of which there are four vi-counts, &s;ix earls, three marque&s;&s;es, and twa duks, be&s;ides lairds and baronets out of aw re-ch-oning beyond number.&mdash;What humming and hawing in this dull, prolix declaration!</P>
<P>Where is the propriety of <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s guardian being uncle to Sir <HI>Callaghan?</HI> It gives room to &s;u&s;pect; a collu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Beau <HI>Mordecai,</HI> the little <HI>Girge&s;hite,</HI> re|turns brimful of joy to tell them the <HI>Iri&s;h|man</HI> is coming. Sir <HI>Callaghan</HI> whom, from the de&s;cription given of his per&s;on and carriage, one was to expect to &s;ee enter the room in a mo&s;t formidable, &s;wagger|ing
<PB N="14" REF="16">
manner, and dealing terror around, on the contrary comes on with all the mild vacancy of looks that denote a good-na|tured, untravelled young man.</P>
<P>He addre&s;&s;es the lady rather with re|&s;pectful ba&s;hfulne&s;s and timidity than con|formable to the boi&s;terous picture <HI>Char|lotte</HI> had drawn of him, and up to which his dialogue is not written; &s;o the actor is not at all in fault, but the author is for his incon&s;i&s;tences.</P>
<P>He is a&s;ked to indulge the lady with the de&s;cription of a battle, which he de|clines at fir&s;t for the rea&s;on that he thinks it unbecoming to make mention of &s;uch matters before a lady, and that it favours too much of the <HI>Fan-&s;a-ron.</HI></P>
<P>But urged farther he declares to her, "that there is &s;o much doing every where, there is no knowing what is done any where&mdash;that every man has &s;o much, bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his own, he has no time to mind that of his neighbours&mdash;that there is &s;uch drumming, and &s;houting, and &s;moke, and fighting, and the delicious noi&s;e of arms, that it is no more po&s;&s;ible to give an ac|count
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of a battle than of the &s;tars in the firmament."</P>
<P><HI>M'Sarca&s;m,</HI> like another <HI>Iago,</HI> in order to bring <HI>Mordecai</HI> into a &s;crape, eggs him on to put to Sir <HI>Callaghan</HI> &s;uch que&s;tions as might the readier provoke his anger.</P>
<P><HI>Mordecai</HI> a&s;ks in a pert manner, "Pray, Sir <HI>Callaghan,</HI> how many men may you have killed in your time?"&mdash;To which Sir <HI>Cal|laghan</HI> replies, "More than a coward would choo&s;e to eat, or an impertinent fellow would dare to look on&mdash;So, are you an&s;wered, Mr. Beau <HI>Mordecai?</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> hugs him&s;elf with joy at the agreeable notion of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s running him&s;elf into a &s;crape, which might pro|bably rid him of both rivals&mdash;He encou|rages him to go on.</P>
<P>To <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s ridiculous taunting and &s;aying, If he were a general, Sir <HI>Callaghan</HI> rejoins, turning to the lady, "Look at the general, Madam&mdash;it is a trade not &s;o ea&s;y to be learned; it requires great ge|nius, as well as being up late and early, enduring the &s;ummer's &s;corching heat and winter's freezing cold; dangers &s;hould be
<PB N="16" REF="18">
his chief delight, glory ever in view, death his greate&s;t reward, by which he will <HI>live</HI> for ever."</P>
<P>During this &s;peech the Scot and the Jew are chuckling to each other, the lat|ter bur&s;ting into a &s;it of laughter, cries, "O the bull, a man live by death!"</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Callagh.</HI> "Yes, Mr. <HI>Mordecai,</HI> a man live by his death. Is not Julius Cae&s;ar, Alexander, and all the other heroes, tho' dead two thou&s;and years ago, alive in hi&s;|tory, and will be &s;o to the end of time?&mdash; And is not your brave young General, who died for his country's glory before QUE|BEC, as much alive as any of them, and will be &s;o to the end of time?"</P>
<P>This is a mob-timed, nay begging <HI>clap|trap,</HI> and therefore the lady with a &s;well|ing brea&s;t figures in to this purpo&s;e; "All the brave men who peri&s;hed on that oc|ca&s;ion mu&s;t be thought on with applau&s;e, while Briti&s;h annals or Briti&s;h gratitude remains."</P>
<P>The <HI>Dur&s;eys,</HI> the <HI>Lockmans,</HI> the <HI>Mac|leanes,</HI> and all of that &s;pecies, are &s;ure of claps by &s;uch &s;pringes to catch wood|cocks;
<PB N="17" REF="19">
but true genius di&s;dains, becau&s;e the claims it has on &s;ame derive from more noble motives.</P>
<P>Opportunely a me&s;&s;age comes about dinner, which draws away the <HI>Lady</HI> and the <HI>Jew</HI>&mdash;<HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> having repre&s;ented the latter as a mo&s;t contemptible being, a ra&s;cal, &amp;c. to the <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> a&s;ks him if he has written the letter, according as he had advi&s;ed; to the young lady?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Callaghan</HI> replies in the negative; but &s;ays he has written a letter to the uncle, which, in his &s;en&s;e, will do as well. At this an&s;wer <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> &s;niggers to him&s;elf, and prays to hear the contents as matter of entertaining curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Among other articles, <HI>O Brallaghan</HI> reads in the letter, "nothing is &s;o un|becoming a man of honour as to be|have like a &s;coundrel;" upon the novelty of which &s;entiment <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> &s;neeringly compliments him, which the dubbed hero receives kindly.</P>
<P>In the &s;ub&s;equent part of his letter is this paragraph, "bidding him to con&s;i|der the antiquity of the <HI>O Brallaghans</HI> fa|mily,
<PB N="18" REF="20">
as old, nay older than any family in the three kingdoms, or even in Europe, it being related to all the <HI>O Sullivans, O Shag|he&s;e&s;nys, O Flahertys, M'Dermots, M'Clogh|lans, &amp;c."</HI>&mdash;a thorough Mile&s;ian li&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> objects to the a&s;&s;ertion of his family being &s;o ancient, and that when he &s;aid &s;o, he mu&s;t have lo&s;t fight of the North Britons, who are the only pure nobility in Great Britain.</P>
<P><HI>O Brallaghan</HI> an&s;wers, "he knew very well what he had &s;aid;" upon which <HI>M'Sarca&s;m</HI> in&s;inuates in an angry manner, "that his having &s;aid &s;o mu&s;t be attri|buted to his ignorance and vanity."</P>
<P><HI>O Brallaghan</HI> kindles, and &s;ays, he does not under&s;tand what <HI>M' Sarca&s;m</HI> would be at; who &s;ays, that <HI>O Brallaghan</HI>'s a&s;&s;er|tion mu&s;t be a&s;cribed "to his being igno|rant and vain." <HI>O Brallaghan</HI> in a mild manner declares that <HI>M' Sarca&s;m</HI> mu&s;t eat his words, or give him <HI>(0 Brallaghan)</HI> &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>M'Sarca&s;m,</HI> with a violent affectation of ira&s;cibility, draws for immediate ac|tion; again&s;t which, on account of the

<P>The lady being left alone, and a clear &s;tage for Sir <HI>Callaghan,</HI> on he comes, and all the rea&s;on he gives for his ab&s;ence is, that he was enjoying him&s;elf in a &s;oliloquy about her, though in the mean time there was a po&s;&s;ibility of one of his rivals making advances in her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>She allows him but little time to apolo|gize, before &s;he a&s;ks him for a &s;ong, not for her entertainment alone, but his rival hearers; which is a violent proof of the author's knowledge of the behaviour of women of polite education and rank.</P>
<P>By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of liquor he thinks him|&s;elf better enabled to &s;peak his mind to the lady.&mdash;He would fain excu&s;e him&s;elf from &s;inging a &s;ong (which &s;he is put on to a&s;k by <HI>M' Sarca&s;m</HI>) and pleads the fear of hav|ing

<PB N="38" REF="40">
<Q><L><HI>Of all the hu&s;bands living, an Iri&s;hman's the be&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With my fal, lal, lal, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>No nation on the globe like him can &s;tand the te&s;t;</HI></L>
<L><HI>With my fal, lal, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Engli&s;h they are drones, as plainly you may &s;ee;</HI></L>
