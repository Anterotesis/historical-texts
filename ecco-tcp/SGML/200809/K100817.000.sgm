<P>Perhaps not: I have been forming a &s;cheme, in the pro&s;ecution of which I mu&s;t beg your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I mean to &s;acri|fice this Cromwelian calf at the altar of Hymen.</P>

<P>Impo&s;&s;ible! you cannot be &s;e|rious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your attention for a moment:&mdash;Ann Killigrew has been invari|ably my friend. Long before I was the Infanta's deputy, &s;he was zealous in my &s;ervice: &s;he en|couraged my propen&s;ity to comedy, flattered my feeble talent, and obtained my admi&s;&s;ion to the &s;tage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what has this to do with her marrying Sir Oliver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppre&s;s your impatience:&mdash;you &s;hall know in a moment. My friend has laughed away 45 years, inattentive to her in|tere&s;t, and carele&s;s of her income, which, like a glittering bubble, glided down the &s;tream &s;o fa&s;t, till at length if bur&s;t. I propo&s;e, that, in this &s;hipwreck of her fortune, the Oliverian knight &s;hall &s;ave her from &s;inking.&mdash;Thus I have an opportunity offered me of repay|ing her friend&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of your whim&s;ical flights, an airy child of your creation&mdash;a chi|mera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>No chimera, I a&s;&s;ure you: Sir Oliver will mo&s;t certainly apply to the inter|vention of my good offices, for the &s;ucce&s;s of his memorial: I &s;hall freely promi&s;e him my in|tere&s;t; and &s;hall intimate to him, at the &s;ame time, that a matrimonial connection with &s;ome royali&s;t would &s;mooth every ob&s;tacle to his pe|tition; as it would be a proof to the king of the truth of his political conver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow that the avaricious knight will be governed by his intere&s;t: but how will you induce the lady to connect her&s;elf with this formal old batchelor? take my word &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="7">will never reli&s;h a &s;ea&s;t compo&s;ed of &s;uch ob&s;o|lete ingredients.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>The per&s;on, my dear Killigrew, who waits for dinner, till it is very late, without having taken any intervening refre&s;hment, is not exacting or fa&s;tidious concerning the cookery. Direct the application to Ann Killigrew, and you will not, I think, de&s;pair of my obtaining her con&s;ent. I hear a carriage; it is mo&s;t likely the knight with his formality and his memorial. I beg you will receive him, and inform him of my royal injunction, to &s;tay here till the arrival of his maje&s;ty. As to the matrimonial negocia|tion, leave that entirely to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it you will not &s;uc|ceed, in a&s;&s;imilating &s;uch incongruities, as the formal knight and the laughter-loving dame, Ann Killigrew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do not &s;ucceed, the nego|ciating part will divert me: In the comedy of life, as well as of the theatre, I require &s;ome under plot be&s;ide the main de&s;ign&mdash;Adieu.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>The language &s;poken here is the &s;ame as is u&s;ed at Whitehall; and it is a lan|guage acquired without much difficulty, as it is not very copious: for example, we have but two vowels which govern our whole alphabet, and they are <HI>U</HI> and <HI>I:</HI> but <HI>U</HI> is always kept in &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection to <HI>I.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Charles Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in doubt whether or no, I &s;hall be vain of that compliment; for &s;ince, Sir Oliver, you denominate us courtiers &s;tars, it &s;eems as if you thought our whole crowded con&s;tellation made at mo&s;t a brilliant night, &s;ince the &s;un of the common-wealth is gone down.</P>

<P>That is not &s;trictly true: one ma&s;ter has made me pay five hundred pounds entrance.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;e, Sedley, we give our pupil a cur&s;ory knowledge of the current expre&s;&s;ions in our &s;ociety, which are &s;tamped with our peculiar meaning. For example, Sir Oliver, when we &s;peak of a Lady's mon&s;ter, we always mean the Lady's hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will frequently hear us &s;ay, &s;uch a Lady has a &s;hort memory; ob|&s;erve this has nothing to do with the retentive faculty in general, it only &s;ignifies that the Lady is inadvertent to one &s;mall unimportant article of the matrimonial &s;tate&mdash;that is to &s;ay, the vow of fidelity.</P>

<P>I am apt to believe the Ladies at Whitehall are not peculiarly gifted with memory.</P>

<P>Bravo, Sir Oliver, you are an apt &s;cholar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you &s;hould hear us, by chance, call a man an unicorn; the meaning we apply to that term is, that the Gentleman is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a wife, who has only once deviated from the conjugal path, and there|fore he is not entitled to the full honours of the fraternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is quite &s;uperfluous to load Sir Oliver's memory with that term;
<PB N="12" REF="15">for I &s;mcerely believe, that, among the whole herd of courtiers, there is not one &s;ingle unicorn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have other expre&s;&s;ions which we admit; though, like bad coin, they &s;carce amount to half the value they pretend to.&mdash;When any per&s;on among us &s;ays, 'I pro|mi&s;e you' &s;uch a thing; we interpret that expre&s;&s;on into a conditional value: that is to &s;ay, the per&s;on intends to keep his promi&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ome intervening objection &s;hould ari&s;e.&mdash;Is it not &s;o, Killigrew?</P>

<P>There are ladies who have pa&s;&s;ed their meridian, and who&s;e years amount|ing to the number (I'll &s;uppo&s;e) of forty-two, would ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilate with the number fifty-eight. The two &s;eparate numbers, thus coupled, would &s;ummed up make exactly 4258, which union carries with it a good omen; for it is the number that came up the fir&s;t prize in the la&s;t year's lottery.</P>

<P>I never was more in earne&s;t in my life: I have a lady in view, who would &s;uit you in every re&s;pect: She is about the age I mentioned; di&s;playing a rich &s;hew of autum|nal beauty; attended by all the charms that affability, courteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;prightline&s;s, and in|nocence, can be&s;tow.</P>

<P>The la&s;t article of the inven|tory is as much her property as her other good qualities: and, it is an additional merit to have lived &s;o many years in the warm cli|mate of Whitehall, without &s;ingeing the ermine of her innocence. Lord Roche&s;ter frequently compares her to an i&s;icle hanging over the mouth of a volcano:&mdash;and take notice, Sir Oliver, that Roche&s;ter is of great authority on a &s;ubject of this nature.</P>

<P>Indeed Sir Oliver, if I had a mind to be &s;evere, I might &s;ay that the fir&s;t of April need not take the trouble of coming for the purpo&s;e you allude to, as it would find the work already done: but I once more a&s;&s;ure you, that I never was more re&s;olutely
<PB N="17" REF="20">in earne&s;t. The marrying a lady for whom the King entertains the highe&s;t regard, will be the means, the only means, of promoting the &s;ucce&s;s of your memorial. The coming into a matrimonial contact with a Lady of the Court, will be a pa&s;&s;port to the royal favour&mdash;it will, like the waters of Lethe, wa&s;h out of remembrance your original &s;pot of repub|licani&s;m.</P>

<P>I am happy to ob&s;serve this youth|ful impatience in you&mdash;neverthele&s;s, you &s;hall not know who your bride is, till you are intro|duced to her; which will be in the cour&s;e of a few hours.</P>

I advi&s;e you, Sir Oliver, to go into the garden, and meditate among the flowers: the per&s;ume of the aromatic tribe &s;o&s;tens the heart and di&s;po&s;es it to love; it &s;timulates the imagination and tinges it with all the bright diver&s;ity of colouring&mdash;To the following lines Sir John Davies attempered his lyre, in the days of the Virgin Queen.</P>

<P>To indulge that ea&s;y unre&s;tricted flow of conver&s;ation, which peculiarly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes our friend&s;hip, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I can|not ea&s;ily comprehend, how you have e&s;caped every &s;nare that art and ingenuity prepared for you, in the younger part of your life.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ann Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t own I had &s;ome felici|tous e&s;capes from the&s;e gentlemen: I mu&s;t, how|ever, except again&s;t one per&s;on on your li&s;t: I mean Sir John Suckling, with whom I never was a favourite.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are enough remaining on the li&s;t, after Sir John is era&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ann Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for Buckingham, he was very a&s;&s;iduous, and extremely in earne&s;t: he
<PB N="22" REF="25">called upon me one day, when he was a candi|date for my favour, at a time when, in the heat of his canva&s;s, he pre&s;umed of his election. He found me reading the poem of Ab&s;alom and Achitophel (then recently publi&s;hed), in which you know Buckingham is excellently pourtrayed under the denomination of Zimri. I a&s;ked his Grace in what character he paid me the honour of a vi&s;it&mdash;whether as a lover, a painter, a chymi&s;t, a fidler, or a buffoon?&mdash;This, I &s;uppo&s;e, enraged him; for he abruptly withdrew, and never returned.&mdash;So much for Buckingham&mdash;</P>
<P>St. Evremond was al&s;o very pre&s;&s;ing to obtain my favour. He brought with him that refined civili&s;ation, that elegance of manners, that play|ful conver&s;e, that enamelled wit, &s;o character|i&s;tic of his countrymen. He talked a philo&s;o|phical jargon, which I did not comprehend, though it plea&s;ed me. He laughed at the folly of the re&s;trictive virtues, and &s;ent them all to Milton's paradi&s;e of fools. But his ugline&s;s unfa&s;cinated the powers of his eloquence: my Guardian Angel &s;at a&s;tride on the large wen on his forehead, and &s;aved me from ruin&mdash;&s;o much for St. Evremond.</P>

<P>Old Waller u&s;ed al&s;o to &s;hoot at me, but his bullets being nothing more than poetical &s;ugar-plumbs, no mi&s;chief en&s;ued. But the mo&s;t formidable battle that ever I was en|gaged in, was again&s;t Roche&s;ter: It was &s;ome years ago, when he acted the part of a German conjuror in the city: the celebrity of 'the Ger|man fortune-teller excited my curio&s;ity, for I had not the &s;malle&s;t intimation who it was&mdash;But I tire you perhaps.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the rever&s;e, I am impa|tience to hear the remainder of your &s;tory.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ann Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner, in the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of a village girl: and &s;tole away (at night) into the city, in a hackney coach. As &s;oon as I was introduced to the venerable necromancer, he acco&s;ted me in the&s;e words:&mdash;"My beautiful little ru&s;tic, you will mo&s;t certainly be wedded to the youth you love."&mdash;To which gracious prophecy I returned a very humble, aukward, and cottage|like curte&s;ey. He added&mdash;"I perceive however, my dear girl, that the &s;tars will not con&s;ent to the marriage you have &s;o much at heart, till
<PB N="24" REF="27">you have made &s;ome other per&s;on happy fir&s;t; and the &s;ooner you make &s;ome per&s;on happy, the &s;ooner you will po&s;&s;e&s;s the youth of your affection." He next put a Portugal piece into my hand, then locked the door, threw away his necromantic garment, tore off his whi&s;kers, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his hoary locks, and &s;uddenly the German Doctor was transformed into the gay, the daring, the amorous Roche&s;ter.</P>

<P>However, you will bear te&s;ti|mony to the innocence of the poor girl.</P>

<P>Yes! But not to her inte|grity, for &s;he robbed me of a guinea.</P>

<P>That guinea was well di&s;tri|buted among the watchmen who protected her.</P>

<P>What are you talking of, Lady Luke?</P>

<P>We allude to a di&s;gui&s;e her Lady&s;hip once a&s;&s;umed, to deceive Lord Roche&s;ter.</P>

<P>Let me a&s;k you, Roche&s;ter, if you have lately di&s;played any fla&s;hes of wit, if you have uttered any <HI>bon mot</HI> worth being recorded, without rai&s;ing a blu&s;h on the female cheek?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Roche&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>The latter part of your que&s;tion is &s;uperfluous re&s;pecting blu&s;hes; for, though we live among the fair creation, and may very properly denominate them flowers, we cannot &s;o properly give them the poetical appellation of <HI>Blu&s;hing</HI> Ro&s;es?</P>

<P>Very good!</P>

<P>With regard to your Maje&s;ty's general inquiry, I mu&s;t own I have been dull and melancholy of late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Killigrew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Roche&s;ter was delivered of a tolerable <HI>bon mot</HI> ye&s;terday. We were walking, Sir, together, and we met Shadwell the poet: He acco&s;ted us, and &s;aid,&mdash;"Gentlemen, I wonder to &s;ee you abroad in &s;uch bad weather." To which Roche&s;ter replied. "I believe you and I are walking from different motives; I walk in order to get an appetite to my dinner; and you, perhaps, Mr. Shadwell, to procure a dinner for your appetite: and therefore you &s;hall dine with me."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell Gwyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is as much ill|nature as wit in that <HI>bon mot.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Roche&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, the bard drank copiou&s;ly of the viny helicon, till, big with the god, he reeled with poetic maje&s;ty into my carriage, which conveyed him home.</P>

<P>Give me leave to inform your Maje&s;ty that Sir Oliver is &s;tealing again a glance at his watch.</P>

<P>By no means, I am in this in&s;tance only, Sir Oliver's ta&s;ter! Before we part, I will repeat to the bridegroom four lines, written &s;ome time ago by Sir Charles Sedley, addre&s;&s;ed to the bride:&mdash;</P>

<L>Were I Apollo? no! I would not chu&s;e</L>

<L>She &s;hould be Thetis!&mdash;and the day &s;hould end.</L>

<P>I will now, as your Lady|&s;hip's bride-maid, attend you to your bed|chamber; where, like a poor hare, after various windings, you will be taken on the very &s;pot from which you &s;at out.</P>

<P>I will only add a few words more: as we both have gargled our mind with a little &s;puttering of the Latin tongue, I will di&s;per&s;e your apprehen&s;ions with a line from Martial's Epigrams:&mdash;<HI>Poete non dolet.</HI></P>
