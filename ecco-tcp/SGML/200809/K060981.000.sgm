<HEAD>AN ESSAY at removing National Prejudices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HItherto all the Tracts I have &s;een upon the Subject of the Union &s;erve only to Two Ends.</P>
<P>Either Hi&s;torically to relate what has been done towards a Union in other and former Treaties, with the particular Ob|&s;tructions on either Side.</P>
<P>Or to debate the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, What &s;ort of Union is mo&s;t proper for the Nations at this time?</P>
<P>The &s;everal Authors have done &s;o much on the fir&s;t of the&s;e, that nothing is wanting to be added to their Work; and on the &s;econd, their Rea&s;onings are many on both Sides, which I &s;hall abridge fir&s;t, and then, perhaps, add &s;omething farther, which may not be u&s;ele&s;s in the Ca&s;e; and which, as a Column erected on a prepar'd Pede&s;tal, may ri&s;e up to a compleat Form, agreeable in Order and Beauty to the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to commence a Treaty of Union, and which mu&s;t after be referr'd to the great collected Councils on either Side, while National Aver&s;ions remain unmov'd, and Im|mortal Prejudices fill the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Mountains, which mu&s;t be levell'd, to make &s;mooth this Valley of Peace; and this is the Feaver in the Blood, which, 'till 'tis abated, and the Inflammation carry'd off the great National Wound can never be cur'd.</P>
<P>A Temper to Peace mu&s;t be found, or <HI>if not found,</HI> mu&s;t be form'd in hoth Nations, as the great Preliminary to this Treaty; and without which it will be in vain to enter upon the greater Articles of it.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
If this be wanting, to what purpo&s;e does the Queen invite, the Parliament prepare, and Commi&s;&s;ioners meet, other than to furni&s;h Authors to compleat their Hi&s;torical Accounts, of what has been to little purpo&s;e attempted towards a Union.</P>
<P>And yet I am not &s;peaking here of the Temper of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, on either Hand, with Re&s;pect to Union; I make no Que&s;tion, but they come on both Sides heartily inclin'd to the thing in general, I wi&s;h them as &s;incerely agreing in the Methods.</P>
<P>But as what they do, is to be recommended to, and laid before the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, who&s;e Members, without any Reflection on them, may be variou&s;ly influenc'd, from Cau&s;es too many to repeat here, and on whom the ancient Pre|judices of the Times may have made too large Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I cannot but think 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to E&s;&s;ay the Removing tho&s;e Prejudices, in the be&s;t manner I can, as a thing no Man has yet attempted, and as what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the great Work we are upon.</P>
<P>I believe I may be allow'd to &s;ay, without any Charge of Partiality, or Affectation to our &s;elves, or of our real Merit, That there are not Two braver Nations in the World; or that have more &s;hown their Courage and Gallantry, upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>And as the&s;e Two People inhabit one I&s;land, neither &s;epe|rated by dangerous Seas or unpa&s;&s;ible Mountains, neither bounded with va&s;t De&s;erts or great Rivers, by which either the Communications of Peace and Trade, or the Acce&s;s of War might be rendred difficult, the on-looking World has beheld with no le&s;s Wonder than Plea&s;ure, that they have not to this Day been able to unite in one Body.</P>
<P>Their Wonder mu&s;t needs ari&s;e from its being the appa|rent Intere&s;t of both Nations, long &s;ince to have joyn'd Hands to their mutual Intere&s;t, and to have joyn'd their Force to their mutual Strength and Defence; no Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> whom Nature had &s;eem'd to prepare for &s;uch a Union, and laid up in &s;tore &s;o many vi&s;ible Advantages of Uniting, being to
<PB N="3" REF="6">
be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;o blind to their real Intere&s;ts, without great Scandal even to their Under&s;tandings, or at lea&s;t to their Temper. It cannot but have &s;eem'd &s;trange to all the Na|tions of the World, who &s;ee into the va&s;t Advantages of a Union to both the&s;e Kingdoms, that they them&s;elves, who have neither of them been counted among the fooli&s;he&s;t Na|tions of the World, &s;hould not &s;ee it al&s;o; and that &s;o many Revolutions of State and of Years, as have pa&s;s'd over their Heads, &s;o many afflicting Circum&s;tances, War, Blood, De|va&s;tation, and De&s;truction, have not yet been able to make them wi&s;e to their own Peace, and &s;how them even by the contra|ry the Nece&s;&s;ity, as well as the Profit, of a firm Union be|tween them, &s;uch as may for ever &s;hut the Door again&s;t the fatal Inva&s;ions, Depredations, and terrible Eruption of Blood and War, which, with but &s;mall Intermi&s;&s;ions, have alternate|ly afflicted both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Nor has it been without &s;ome &s;ecret Satisfaction that our Neighbours have ob&s;erv'd this, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them as have either envy'd or apprehended the Addition of Strength &s;uch a Union would be to the&s;e Nations, and the formidable Encrea&s;e it would be to the <HI>Britannick</HI> Power. It cannot but have been very plea&s;ing to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Govern|ments, with whom we have been at open Wars, to ob&s;erve how the National Animo&s;ities between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> have always kept them embroyl'd, and by &s;pending their Native Fury, <HI>terrible to them,</HI> upon one another, prevented the Mi&s;chiefs, and le&s;&s;en'd the Powers, <HI>of the Engli&s;h e&s;pecially,</HI> which, they had Rea&s;on to fear, might have otherwi&s;e been too formidable for them to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious here to recite the innumerable In|&s;tances, how the Divi&s;ions of the&s;e Nations have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to the ri&s;ing Glory of our Neighbours; and he that has not read how <HI>France,</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> the Dauphin, afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> the VIIth. when by the Conque&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth. &s;he was almo&s;t entirely &s;ubjected to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> recovered
<PB N="4" REF="7">
her &s;elf, chiefly by the Valour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Scots,</HI> mu&s;t not pa&s;s with me for a Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Scotland</HI> been then united to <HI>England,</HI> and the Thirty Thou&s;and <HI>Scots,</HI> which at &s;undry Times went over to a&s;&s;i&s;t that dejected Prince, been &s;ent thither to joyn the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Armies, then under the brave Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Regent of <HI>France,</HI> and the be&s;t Generals <HI>England</HI> ever &s;aw, <HI>France</HI> had, for ought we know, been entirely &s;ubjected to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Power, and <HI>Britain</HI> had given Law to all the&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>'T would be endle&s;s to trace Antiquity, and bring upon the Stage the very many In&s;tances when <HI>Scotland</HI> has had the Fate of <HI>England</HI> in her Hand; and again, when <HI>England</HI> has put the Yoke upon the Neck of the <HI>Scots</HI> Power. The only u&s;eful Ob&s;ervation from which, to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, is, How the&s;e alternate Advantages over one another, have tended to the weakening both; and, by a Chain of Di&s;a&s;ters, has helpt to reduce us both to the pre&s;ent Condition, and Danger of being overpower'd by our too potent Neighbours; who, had the&s;e Nations been long ago united under prudent and politick Mea&s;ures had perhaps been always kept too low to have lookt us in the Face.</P>
<P>Now Di&s;a&s;ter begins to make us wi&s;e; and though the Steps both Nations have made toward Union, have been ve|ry &s;low, yet it is a long time &s;ince they both &s;aw it their In|tere&s;t, and have expre&s;t a Willingne&s;s to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Whether Providence, for Ends yet unknown to us, or the Nature of things, has retarded it &s;o long, is not for me to de|termine; but very &s;mall have been the Beginnings, and Pro|gre&s;s of this Willingne&s;s to Unite.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step towards a common Courte&s;y between the Nations, was in the Marriage of the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Daugh|ter of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth. to <HI>James</HI> the Fourth King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and 'tis remarkable that wi&s;e Prince was the fir&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> that fore&s;aw an Advantage to <HI>England</HI> by a Union with <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
the Particulars of which we find noted in Hi&s;tory, <HI>viz.</HI> That when the Match was propo&s;ed in Council, it met with great Oppo&s;ition there from an Apprehen&s;ion that one time other &s;uch an Alliance might bring the Crown of <HI>Eng|land</HI> into the Line of <HI>Scotland&mdash;And what i&s; it &s;hould,</HI> &s;ays that wi&s;e Prince, with a Spirit one would think had been Prophe|tical, <HI>If any &s;uch thing &s;hould happen I fore&s;ee that it will come to pa&s;s that our Kingdom of</HI> England <HI>will lo&s;e nothing thereby, be|cau&s;e there will not be an Acce&s;&s;ion of</HI> England <HI>to</HI> Scotland, <HI>but on the contrary, of</HI> Scotland <HI>to</HI> England, <HI>as to that is by much the more noble Head of the whole I&s;land.</HI> Vide <HI>Speed's</HI> Chron. Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth.</P>
<P>Had any Man been by the King, that had known what we now come by Length of Time to under&s;tand, they might have added, but it will be the certain Depre&s;&s;ing and Ruin of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by removing her Court and Gentry, by lo&s;ing the Concour&s;e of Strangers, Re&s;idence of Amba&s;&s;adors, and con|&s;equently the Expence of Money, and the Helps to Trade from her Capital City, by le&s;&s;ening her Intere&s;t in foreign Courts, and her Value in the World, with innumerable Mi&s;|chiefs attending the Meanne&s;s of a Kingdom without a Head.</P>
<P>That <HI>Scotland,</HI> by this means, would rather &s;eem a Pro|vince than a Kingdom, and yet remain without the proper Advantages of a Province of <HI>England</HI> al&s;o; as being treated like Aliens, in every thing injurious and detrimental to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and as Subjects, in every thing advantageous to <HI>England,</HI> tho' prejudicial to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>From this relative Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> VIIth. a &s;ettled Peace with <HI>Scotland</HI> began, and &s;aving &s;ome &s;hort In|tervals under <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth. from a meer Capricio of that warm Prince, the long Peace between the Nations &s;eem'd to prepare them on both Sides for more &s;trict Engagements, by wearing out the Remembrance of former Injuries, and le&s;|&s;ening the Native Animo&s;ities of the People.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
Since this we have had four Conjunctures, in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">o&s;er Union we are now to treat about, has been in &s;ome more than common manner enter'd upon, and which I may &s;ay were e&s;pecially proper to have brought it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t under King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. when the Prote|&s;tant Religion being ju&s;t &s;ettled here, <HI>England</HI> courted her Si&s;er <HI>Scotland</HI> to joyn Hands, and become one Family, under that good Prince: It was the fir&s;t Juncture that we read of, that <HI>England</HI> was governed by a young unmarry'd King, and <HI>Scotland</HI> by a young unmarry'd Queen; at the &s;ame time nothing was &s;o natural, as that by Marriage the Kingdom would become one in the next Blood of both Races.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made the Offer fir&s;t in <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth's time, and now renew'd it, and the Contempt the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;eem'd to &s;how of it, and which appear'd to be the Faction of the Po|pi&s;h Party, fearing the Reformation, provok'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to a War; in which the <HI>Scots</HI> were overthrown in the great Battel at <HI>Pink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>Mu&s;celburgh.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas at this time the famous Declaration was emitted by the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General, when though he was Conquerour, he told the <HI>Scots,</HI> he came not to conquer them, but unite with them, and to offer them all the Advan|tages of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amity. Some of the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of which Declaration, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<Q>We Conquer, and yet we propo&s;e Peace; We gain Victory by War, and we offer Amity and Friend&s;hip by Peace; We &s;eek not Conque&s;t, but Alliance, that you may be united in all things with us, in Marriage, in Trade, and all the Advantages of a la&s;ting Amity.</Q>
<P>If any Man plea&s;e to read the &s;aid Declaration at large, too long to be incerted here, he will ea&s;ily &s;ee that Age had quite different Thoughts from us, concerning a Treaty with <HI>Scot|land;</HI> that they knew a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Conque&s;t would never keep <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that Union, not Victory, was the com|mon Intere&s;t of this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
But the <HI>Scots</HI> then could not &s;ee their Intere&s;t, the Power of Popi&s;h Councils prevail'd upon them; and for Fear of Re|formation, they rejected the ju&s;t Advantages to the State, and &s;ent away the Queen privately to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The next Turn was more effectual, and this was at the Coming of King <HI>James</HI> the VIth. of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England:</HI> The Prophetick Expre&s;&s;ions, quoted before from the Mouth of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth. were now come to pa&s;s, and the Crown of <HI>England</HI> devolv'd upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Had K. <HI>James</HI> done Ju&s;tice to his Native Country, had he thought of their future Pro&s;perity; in &s;hort, had he thought of any thing but neglecting his own Kingdom, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the true In|tere&s;t of it;&mdash;it was, without doubt, ab&s;olutely in his Power to have brought an entire Union to pa&s;s, and to have ended all the Difficulties, Di&s;putes, and Quarrels, that afterward em|broil'd the&s;e Kingdoms in bloody Wars, to their mutual Ruin and De&s;truction: But as there were People and Parties then to be found, who envy'd, and perhaps fear'd the publick Tranquility, &s;o there has never &s;ince wanted a &s;ucceeding Race to inherit their Rancour; and who, on all Occa&s;ions, blow the Coals of Di&s;&s;affection between the two Nations.</P>
<P>How the good Endeavours of tho&s;e People, who at the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> labour'd hard to begin the new Reign with a Union of Nations, came to be defeated, and the further Pro&s;ecution of it dropt; how King <HI>James</HI> for|getting the true Intere&s;t of his Country, in&s;tead of gratifying the <HI>Scots</HI> with what might have been for the general Good of the Kingdom, only brought a long Train of them hither, who gaping for Preferment, and equally neglecting their own Coun|try, &s;erv'd only to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> jealous, and unea&s;y, and con&s;equently aver&s;e to uniting. The&s;e are Stories too tedious and too remote to engage in here; 'tis enough to leave it to Po&s;terity that the thing was attempted, but ill per&s;ued, the ble&s;&s;ed healing Juncture being re&s;erv'd to an Opportunity yet to come.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">
How after this, the <HI>Scots</HI> differ'd with K. <HI>Charles</HI> the I&s;t. on his Attempt to impo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service-book upon them: How they came to a Pacification without Blood, or with but a little: How afterwards they fully paid the ill Treatment of the Fa|ther K. <HI>James</HI> upon the Son; who&s;e Ruin, their Army then en|tring, <HI>England</HI> compleated, by turning the Scale of the King's Affairs, and over-ballancing his Forces, at the Great Battel at <HI>Mar&s;tonmoor,</HI> I leave for tho&s;e Gentlemen to con&s;ider, who upon all Occa&s;ions are for reckoning the <HI>Scots for nothing</HI> in their Calculations, and thinking they merit no Regard in the general Account of the Strengths of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the Interval of Affairs here, under the Parliament and <HI>O. Cromwel,</HI> we find a real Union between the Kingdoms, carried on to a kind of Settlement, though &s;omething imper|fect; but whoever contriv'd it, &s;uch a Settlement it was, as, had the next Government thought fit to have built upon it, might have ri&s;en up to all the Parts of a compleat Union; but this dyed with the Times, and the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland</HI> re|turn'd to its full Exerci&s;e under King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the Revolution under King <HI>William,</HI> I mu&s;t own the <HI>Scots</HI> had the faire&s;t Opportunity of perfecting the thing, that perhaps they will ever again be tru&s;ted with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs were then in that Condition, that I can|not but &s;ay, the <HI>Scots</HI> might have almo&s;t forc'd it upon us, if they would: There could have been hardly any Article in the Matters of Trade, or Government, which the Crown of <HI>England</HI> would not have been in a manner very free to give up, to &s;e|cure the <HI>Scots</HI> then in the Intere&s;t of the new e&s;tabli&s;h'd Go|vernment, which for &s;ome time 'twas expected they would waver in; whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in the &s;o &s;peedy Conce&s;&s;ion, and falling in with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlement, did not &s;how more Genero&s;ity than Di&s;cretion; and whether they have been gratefully treated for it &s;ince, I purpo&s;ely omit, becau&s;e being to treat of a Union of the Two Kingdoms, with De&s;ign to prepare both Sides for it, I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">p up no old Sores, nor
<PB N="9" REF="12">
bring to Remembrance any thing that &s;hould tend to prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s either Nation again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>This Opportunity has been lo&s;t, and now the la&s;t Juncture, perhaps, that ever may offer it &s;elf, for the clo&s;ing this mortal Breach &s;eems to appear.</P>
<P>What Steps were made toward it, <HI>or rather from it,</HI> in a late Commi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>&s;eeming Treaty,</HI> I al&s;o purpo&s;ely omit; and though the Umbrage taken here at the <HI>Scots</HI> Act of Secu|rity, the <HI>prepo&s;terous Lav</HI> made here, which was in its Nature a Declaration of War, the marching Troops to the North, fortifying of <HI>Hull,</HI> and the like, are things merit &s;ome Satyr; yet they, who con&s;ider this Nation then under the Influence of a Party, <HI>and of &s;uch a Party,</HI> as were e&s;pecially known by their Aver&s;ion to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as <HI>to &V;nion in general,</HI> will ea&s;ily forget the&s;e Things, as the Remains of a Temper al|ways de&s;tructive to the Good of both Kingdoms; and as Indications only that this was not the proper Sea&s;on for a Union.</P>
<P>But Time, and the Con&s;equences of Things, have brought both the Nations to more healing Mea&s;ures; and <HI>England</HI> now, under the Influence of better Coun&s;els, has thought fit to &s;how the <HI>Scots</HI> their Forwardne&s;s, to take away all ju&s;t Pretences from tho&s;e People, that willingly lay hold of them, to widen the Breaches of the Nations: In order to this, the Parliament has re&s;cinded and abrogated that Act, which gave &s;uch Offence to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and without which, they had declar'd they could not Treat. And I cannot but ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Scots</HI> not put|ing the Notice they took of that Act into their Bill in Parlia|ment, but into an Addre&s;s to the Queen,&mdash;and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament voluntarily repealing the Act, which was injurious to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to make way for this Treaty, &s;eems to be two healing Steps, and &s;uch mutual Advances, as gives great Encouragement to tho&s;e People, who hope for a good I&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent Treaty. By the&s;e Things tho&s;e People were intirely di&s;appointed, who waiting for an Advantage ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the <HI>Scots,</HI> laid hold of the Ca&s;e of <HI>Green and his Crew,</HI> exaggerat|ing
<PB N="10" REF="13">
and exclaiming again&s;t the pretended Inju&s;tice of tho&s;e Ex|ecutions, as a &s;ufficient Ground of a <HI>National Quarrel,</HI> though at the &s;ame time there were two <HI>Scots</HI> hang'd to one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, and tho&s;e condemn'd by the Ordinary Forms of Ju&s;tice and Legal Proce&s;s; in which the forgot, that had they all been <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and had after appear'd to be perfectly in|nocent, yet, that as a Nation, the <HI>Scots</HI> can be an&s;werable for no more than giving Per&s;ons a fair and legal Tryal, according to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice; under which, if unhappy Circum&s;tances invol d them, and they fell, yet, by the Law of Nations, no Publick Blame can by this be fixt upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor any Pretence of a Quarrel be ju&s;tly rais'd upon that Foundation.</P>
<P>I know now nothing to hinder the good I&s;&s;ue and Conclu|&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Treaty, no Cloud upon the Pro&s;pect of the Succe&s;s of it; nothing to apprehend &s;o much from real as imaginary Difficulties, that are rai&s;ed and kept alive by tho&s;e, that really are afraid &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing should befal this Nation.</P>
<P>In order therefore to remove the Mi&s;ts and Vapours of Ima|gination, from the Eyes of the People, and prepare Mens Minds for Union, the De&s;ign of this Work is, To remove the Prejudices &s;ettled, or that &s;eem to be &s;ettled, in the Minds of the Common People of both Nations again&s;t each other; that a Union of the Nations may, as already it is to all wi&s;e Men, be really de&s;ireable to both Sides.</P>
<P>As this is what no Man has yet attempted, I hope it may be an acceptable thing to both Sides, and may open our Eyes to a &s;econd Article, <HI>viz.</HI> the Advantage of a Union to both the Nations.</P>
<P>And having in this Tract gone thro' the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall, in the &s;ub&s;equent Part of the Work, examine a little the Terms of a Union, remove the Difficulties, expo&s;e the Artifice of tho&s;e that form Objections from needle&s;s Fears and Jealou&s;ies, &s;how how a Union may be made without any Danger to, or cla&s;h|ing in the Intere&s;ts of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Churches of, or the tol|lerated
<PB N="11" REF="14">
Di&s;&s;enters in either Nation, clear up their Eye-&s;ight, who cannot &s;ee the Intere&s;t of their Native Country; and &s;o go on to &s;tate the Fact in &s;uch proper Schemes of Eternal Peace, as may, backt with the Wi&s;dom of both Nations, terminate in the la&s;ting Tranquility and vi&s;ible Encrea&s;e of the Power, Wealth, and Magnificence of the mo&s;t powerful I&s;land in the World.</P>
<P>1&s;t. In removing the Prejudice on both Sides, I cannot but ob&s;erve, There is a manife&s;t Difference in &s;uch things as the&s;e, and a Difference which more than ordinarily influences the Suc|ce&s;s of &s;uch an Action, between coming to a Treaty WILLING, de&s;igning, and prepar'd TO REMOVE Difficulties, and bring the thing it &s;elf to a happy Conclu&s;ion: And on the other hand, coming PREPAR'D TO RAISE Difficulties, Cavil, Di&s;pute, and Embarra&s;s a Treaty, that in Time may end in a Rupture, vani&s;h into Air, and come to nothing.</P>
<P>National Prejudices are &s;ome of the wor&s;t &s;ort of Humane Antipathies, and, as they may be applyed, have frequently very bad Effects: And I cannot clear the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from the ju&s;t Charge, of being the Nation in the World the mo&s;t addicted to them; and when once they have entertain'd &s;uch unhappy Notions, are the harde&s;t of any Nation in the World to be brought off from them again, tho' I hope they will not be &s;o influenc'd here.</P>
<P>It is too long a Work here to examine this Particular, or to give Originals for inbred Antipathies of Nations; to &s;ay why the wild ungovern'd <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> that mortally hate the very Name of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, and have often, with the utmo&s;t Barbari|ty, murther'd Thou&s;ands of our People in cold Blood, are le&s;s hated by us than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> between whom and this Nation, mutual Engagements and National Kindne&s;&s;es have frequent|ly pa&s;s'd to the common Advantage of both; why the <HI>French,</HI> between whom and this Nation frequent, terrible, and bloody Wars have often happen'd, are more re&s;pected than the <HI>Scots</HI> who inhabit the &s;ame <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> Natives of the &s;ame I&s;land,

in the Grave of Time, never to be reviv'd, but by the mo&s;t unaccountable Folly and Madne&s;s this Age can be guilty of.</P>
<P>But not to enter too far back upon the ungrateful Task of examining our Forefathers Mi&s;carriages, I &s;hall come to the pre&s;ent National Prejudices, which, I think, &s;eem to prepare the Minds of the People with unhappy Aver&s;ions to Union: And the&s;e I take to be &s;uch as follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. On Our Side again&s;t the <HI>Scots.</HI> For,</P>
<P>1&s;t. <HI>Their Share in the la&s;t Civil War:</HI> As to this, I can on|ly &s;ay, 'tis too long a Quarrel to decide here, and merits on all Sides to be buried in Oblivion; &s;ince take it from Beginning to End, the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;uffered deeply, had their Share in the blood and Ruin of their Kingdom, and, at la&s;t, &s;uffer'd al|mo&s;t an entire Reduction to <HI>England,</HI> for attempting to re|&s;tore our Monarchy: Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the vulgar Mob Charge of <HI>&s;elling the King,</HI> which ignorant People, <HI>and no other,</HI> reproach them with: 'Tis need|le&s;s to enter into the Hi&s;tory of it, but refer the Objector to the&s;e few Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. They had no Power to have protected his Maje&s;ty, or to defend them&s;elves again&s;t an inevitable War with <HI>England:</HI> which, with a potent and victorious Army threatned to fall upon them, if they had carried the King away.</P>
<P N="2">2. They were under no Ties of Obligation to the King, as a Pri&s;oner taken; They were in Arms again&s;t him, and he came and put him&s;elf into their Hands, to their great Sur|prize, which is a yielding at Di&s;cretion; and, by the Law of Arms, left them at Liberty to di&s;po&s;e of him as they thought fit; and his Maje&s;ty was &s;en&s;ible, the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Af|fairs made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to detain him, unle&s;s they would immediately have come over to his Cau&s;e, which they could not do, nor did the King expect they would, ha|ving been in Arms again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor did they take any Mony as a Price for the King, only agreed to depart, and deliver the King, who they dur&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="17">
not keep, and capitulated to have the Money paid them, which was due from the Parliament to them before.</P>
<P N="4">4. And la&s;tly, Nor did <HI>they part with the King,</HI> without making Articles with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in his Behalf, that they &s;hould treat him with Freedom, Honour, and Safety; which Arti|cles, if they had been kept, the King had been a Gainer by what the <HI>Scots</HI> did on his Behalf: And if the&s;e Agreements were after broken, and the King ill treated, 'tis the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t an&s;wer for that, not the <HI>Scots;</HI> who not only com|plain'd of it, but re&s;ented it &s;o highly, that they took Arms again&s;t the Parliament on that very Score, to revenge his Death, and made great Attempts to re&s;tore his Son, even to their own Ruin, and the Subver&s;ion of their Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>So that doing Ju&s;tice, this Prejudice is ab&s;olutely groundle&s;s and unrea&s;onable; and &s;eems to be rais'd upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> only to extenuate what &s;ome People &s;ell into, with re&s;pect to that Prince, and can therefore leave no ju&s;t Reproach upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> who, 'tis evident, by the Ruin they brought upon them|&s;elves, in endeavouring to re&s;tore the Son, were no way ca|pable of defending the Father.</P>
<P>Whether then &s;hall we come for a Prejudice again&s;t the <HI>Scots;</HI> the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Objection we have, again&s;t uniting with them, is that they are Presbyterians; and <HI>What if they were Papi&s;ts?</HI> Are Differences in Opinion incompatible with Union: How do we &s;ee the Numbers of <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in <HI>Holland</HI> no manner of Ob&s;truction to the Union of the Pro|vinces; the Popi&s;h and Prote&s;tant Cantons of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> united in a perpetual Confederacy. All the Prejudices that ari&s;e from this Sugge&s;tion amount to no more than this, not that it im|pedes a Union, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and exten&s;ive Meaning at all, but that 'tis with Reluctan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e that they &s;hould &s;ee it.</P>
<P>This, without any Inju&s;tice, I call Party-Prejudice; and now they begin to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> us, the Danger of the Church of <HI>England</HI> will be brought upon the Stage again and that here will be an evi|dent Proof of it, which no body can an&s;wer; and we begin already to be threatned with that Clamour.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
To remove at lea&s;t the Ground-work of this Pretence, I think, it may be proper a little to enter into a Hi&s;tory of Probabilities and calculate the Strength of Parties here as briefly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>There is indeed &s;ome Difference here not between Author and Author among our High Church Champions, but between Authors and them&s;elves; &s;ometimes they will have the Di&s;&s;en|ters &s;o incon&s;iderable a Party, that they can be ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;uppre&s;t, and ought to be &s;o, to prevent growing Mi&s;chiefs; at other times, the &s;ame Authors will have them be &s;o formidable, that they are every Day frighting their Children, with their running and overturning both Church and State: What &s;hall we do with &s;uch People as the&s;e? If it &s;erves their Turn to cry out of <HI>the Danger of the Church,</HI> and the fatal Plots of the Di&s;&s;enters, then they are a formidable Party, and the Government mu&s;t be warn'd again&s;t them; and the Church is call'd upon to &s;tand fa&s;t, and quit them&s;elves like Men, <HI>and the like.</HI> If they find it proper to vaunt a little, and in&s;ult the Di&s;&s;enters, then they are a mean and contemptible Party, and not worth any Body's Notice.</P>
<P>Upon this Uncertainty 'tis evident there can no ju&s;t Calcula|tion be made from the&s;e People's Judgments; but let us come to the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If we come to unite, <HI>&s;ay the&s;e Gentlemen,</HI> the Presbyterian Power of <HI>Scotland,</HI> joyn'd to the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> will be too &s;trong for the Church; and we &s;hall be overwhelm'd by the Party, and the Church de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee if <HI>the Rever&s;e of this</HI> be not mo&s;t probable: It is the general Opinion, that as to Numbers, the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;et again&s;t the Church, are not more than One to Twelve; as to Wealth, and Intere&s;t; in Trade, they are allow'd to be much more; but as to Numbers, 'tis all wi&s;e Mens Opinion, that one in Twelve is the Out-&s;ide. In <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the &s;ame general Calculations, the Epi&s;copal Party, who I now call Di&s;|&s;enters, are at lea&s;t accounted to; Now tho' the whole Number of <HI>Scots</HI> were joyned to the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and were put in a Ballance of Numbers, 'tis certain they would fall &s;hort of being a Match for the Church; then add their Poverty to the re&s;t, which is the certain and con&s;tant De|&s;truction
<PB N="16" REF="19">
of great De&s;igns, the Church can be in no Danger in Point of Strength, if Providence were to &s;tand neuter, and the Arms of Fle&s;h to try it out.</P>
<P>Let no Prejudices therefore fill our Minds, with re&s;pect to the Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> the Wealth and Strength of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Government is wholly a Church of <HI>England</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment, is beyond all Compari&s;on &s;uperior to the Power of the Di&s;&s;enters, were they &s;o bereav'd of their Sen&s;es, as to attempt to di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>Whoever therefore forms Prejudices in the Heads of the Peo|ple of <HI>England,</HI> concerning Dangers to the Church from this Union, mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, it is done with a &s;ini&s;ter De|&s; gn again&s;t the publick Peace of both Nations, and without any manner of Foundation, grounded either upon Rea&s;on, Truth, or the Nature of Things.</P>
<P>Not but that there are other Rea&s;ons to prove, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> can take no Umbrage from this Union, which are drawn from the Intere&s;ts of each Nation, and from the Cir|cum&s;tances of the <HI>Scots,</HI> which I omit here as not to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But when we con&s;ult the Article of meer Strength, there is no Shaddow of Danger to the Church from the Union, but what at the &s;ame time will hold good to make us fear an entire Con|que&s;t of this Nation by the <HI>Scots,</HI> WITHOUT A UNION; which they will allow to be ridiculous.</P>
<P>If I was to turn the Argument, I confe&s;s I cannot &s;peak with the &s;ame A&s;&s;urance, that there is the &s;ame Safety to the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Ca&s;e of their uniting with &s;o powerful a Government as the Church of <HI>England</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment in this Nation; what an encroaching Party here may not attempt, or at lea&s;t what they would not attempt, if the <HI>Sacred Po&s;tulata</HI> of this Union &s;hould not be backt with the Protection of the Government, I will not an&s;wer for; but the Security of the Publick Faith will have &s;ome Rea&s;ons, be&s;ides the Hone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of &s;uch a Cau&s;e, to protect the <HI>Scots</HI> in all their ju&s;t Rights: Of which I &s;hall &s;peak by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine why it &s;hould remain as a Prejudice in the Minds of the People of either Nation, that they differ in &s;ome Articles of Religion, &s;ince a general Uniformity in Religious
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Matters is not &s;o much as hoped for in this Nation, and can re|ally ju&s;tify the Prejudices again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> no more, than it does our own unnatural Divi&s;ions one among another.</P>
<P>The Difference in both Nations is not <HI>of Religion,</HI> but in <HI>Reli|gious Circum&s;tances;</HI> both are Prote&s;tant both Orthodox in Prin|ciple, and equally oppo&s;ite to Popery, and Antichri&s;tiani&s;m: The E&s;tabli&s;hments of either Nation have no manner of Occa&s;ion to interfere, and an alternate Toleration might ea&s;ily make a Re|conciliation of Charity be univer&s;al.</P>
<P>How fooli&s;h then mu&s;t National Prejudices be, and how much to our own Detriment, as well as to the Encouragement of the Enemies of both Nations, in that they tend to keep di&s;united two Nations, who&s;e Divi&s;ions have been the De&s;truction of &s;o many hundred thou&s;and brave &s;tout Fellows, who&s;e Force, em|ploy'd again&s;t Foreign Nations, might have made <HI>Britain</HI> Mi|&s;tre&s;s of half the Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The next Rank of Prejudices is, of the <HI>Scots</HI> Side again&s;t us.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch as our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their Sovereign, removing their Court, oppre&s;&s;ing their Trade, neglecting them in our pub|lick Treaties, excluding them in Advantages as Aliens, and u&s;ing them as Natives in Ca&s;es to their Lo&s;s, ruining their Collony in <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ten,</HI> &s;eizing their Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Ships, and the like.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e I only &s;ay in general, as they are the proper Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould de&s;ire this Union, &s;o they cannot prejudice them again&s;t it, becau&s;e by a Union they will be all remov'd; and in the pur&s;uit of this Work, I &s;hall undertake to &s;how how they may be remov'd, to the general Satisfaction of both Nations.</P>
<P>I know there are Prejudices relating to Trade, and &s;ome Peo|ple have entertain'd Opinions of the <HI>Scots</HI> ruining us, and enrich|ing them&s;elves by Encroachments upon our Trade; but if I make it appear that a Freedom of Trade is our Advantage, more than the <HI>Scots,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> have been oppre&s;t by us in Trade; and that tho' they &s;hall grow rich, it &s;hall be al&s;o our Advantage, I &s;hall then effectually remove this Prejudice: Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And this leads me of Cour&s;e to examine the Advantages of this Union, on the Mi&s;takes of which farther Prejudices are grounded; and tho' I cannot enter into the particular and &s;epa|rate Advantages, till I come to examine the Heads of Commerce,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
and the relative Con&s;equences, with Re&s;pect to one another, and with Re&s;pect to our Neighbours; yet I cannot but a little con&s;ider the general Advantages which both Nations &s;hall ob|tain in the Conclu&s;ion of this happy Union, in order to open Peoples Eyes to their own Felicity, and to move our Po&s;terity to ble&s;s us, for putting an End to the ruinous Di&s;tempers of both Nations.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, that in all Ca&s;es it is Natural for Men to examine, what Benefit, what Advantage &s;hall fall to them by every thing they undertake? Nor is any Man that has con&s;ider'd, or di&s;cours d in <HI>England</HI> of this Union, igno|rant, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s labour'd very diligently <HI>by &s;ome Men,</HI> to fill our common Peoples Mouths with this Que&s;tion,&mdash;What &s;hall We, <HI>We Engli&s;h-men get by it?</HI> We don't doubt, but <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be the better by it, by being let into our Trade, and let into our Manufactures, and let into all the Advantages of an <HI>Engli&s;h-man;</HI> But what &s;hall WE get by it?</P>
<P>If then the en&s;uing Sheets open this Scene to the View of the People, and prove to the common Under&s;tanding, that the Ad|vantages of this Union <HI>&s;hall be greater</HI> to <HI>England than to Scotland,</HI> it mu&s;t of Cour&s;e reconcile all unprejudic'd impartial People to the Union in general; and this Inference I purpo&s;e &s;hall run through every Head of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>And First,</HI> after which if I was name no more, it was &s;uffici|ent to move us all to de&s;ire this Union, above all National Ble&s;|&s;ings, <HI>the ine&s;timable Advantage</HI> of GENERAL PEACE, a &s;ettled, a <HI>Perpetual</HI> Peace, a final End of Depredation, Ruin, Deva&s;tation and Blood; a <HI>National Friend&s;hip</HI> &s;ucceeding the mo&s;t inveterate <HI>National Feuds,</HI> a general Tranqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ty following un&s;ettled and precarious Circum&s;tances; which has &s;o often broke out into fierce and de&s;tructive Wars, as has, at &s;everal times, been &s;up|po&s;ed to co&s;t the Price of four Millions of the be&s;t Blood in <HI>Chri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">endom.</HI></P>
<P>Can either Nation, <HI>if in their Wits,</HI> &s;ay this is not a &s;ufficient Advantage to make us de&s;ire this Union: Let us lock back to the Fields of <HI>Bannocksbourn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Mu&s;celborough,</HI> and <HI>Dun|bar,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, if the Fountains of Blood opened at tho&s;e fatal Places, merit not to be &s;topt; and whether it is not the Wi&s;dom

<P>Let the Curious look back into Hi&s;tory, and tell me, what has been the Con&s;equences to the Northern Countries of <HI>England,</HI> from above three Hundred formal Inva&s;ions of the <HI>Scots</HI> Armies?

laying down the Scheme of my farther De&s;ign, in which, if I have lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue it, I &s;hall attempt to examine the Terms of Union, which the Nature of Things and Circum&s;tances of both the Nations &s;eem to lead us directly upon.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not undertake to examine the imperfect Schemes of o|ther Men, nor a&s;&s;ume the Vanity of being arriv'd to a Perfection in my own: I know there are Difficulties in a Thing &s;o Nice; and where Prerogatives and Priviledges, both of Prince and Peo|ple, &s;eem to cla&s;h; where Emulations in Families, Honours, Trade, and Circum&s;tances of State &s;eem immovable, and Differences and Animo&s;ities of Religion and Parties have run high.</P>
<P>But a Propen&s;ity in both Sides to Union; a Sen&s;e of mutual Advantages, and a View of the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a Union, will remove abundance of the&s;e Difficulties.</P>
<P>Trifles mu&s;t not &s;tand in the Way of &s;uperior Peace, and Things are ju&s;tly call'd Trifles, with re&s;pect to Nations, and the weighty Concerns of the Blood of Ages, that are otherwi&s;e in them&s;elves con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome People are very fond of what they call a Federal Union, and abundance of Con&s;iderations move them to it, tho' I believe the greate&s;t Rea&s;on mo&s;t of them can give, is, becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee thro' another, and think a general, intire, or in|corporate Union impracticable, or, at lea&s;t, that they think both Nations will not come up to it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pre&s;cribe nothing, but endeavour to &s;how how both are fea&s;ible, and lay open the Articles of either, as plain as I can.</P>
<P>The HEADS now to be treated of, with re&s;pect to this Uni|on, I take to be Three, RELIGION STATE and TRADE; and if in all the&s;e, I can, by Enquiry, find out &s;uch Mediums as may, to the mutual Advantages of both Nations, amount to a Settle|ment, I cannot but think we ought not to fall out about the En|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y, Whether tho&s;e Advantages may &s;eem to be more to one Nation than another.</P>
<P>And &s;hould that be the unkind Debate, the Gentlemen that rai&s;e it, will have this Misfortune, that in all the Three Articles mentioned, the Ballance of Advantage &s;hall turn on our Side, and again&s;t their pretended Exceptions, which I make no que&s;tion to prove, even in the Article of TRADE it &s;elf, in which &s;ome Peo|ple are &s;o very clamorous.</P>
