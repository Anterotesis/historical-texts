<L>WHILE in the&s;e days of &s;entiment and grace</L>
<L>Poor comedy in tears re&s;igns her place,</L>
<L>And &s;mit with novels, full of maxims crude,</L>
<L>She, that was frolick once, now turns a prude;</L>
<L>To her great end the tragic mu&s;e a&s;pires,</L>
<L>At Athens born, and faithful to her &s;ires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The comic &s;i&s;ter in hy&s;teric fit,</L>
<L>You'd &s;wear, has lo&s;t all memory of wit.</L>
<L>Folly, for her, may now exult on high;</L>
<L>Feather'd by ridicule no arrows fly;</L>
<L>But if you are di&s;tre&s;s'd, &s;he's &s;ure to cry.</L>
<L>She that could jig, and nick-name all heav'n's creatures,</L>
<L>With &s;orrows not her own deforms her features;</L>
<L>With &s;tale reflections keeps a con&s;tant pother;</L>
<L>Greece gave her one face, and &s;he makes another;</L>
<L>So very pious, and &s;o full of woe,</L>
<L>You well may bid her "To a nunnery go."</L>
<L>Not &s;o Melpomene; to nature true</L>
<L>She holds her own great principle in view.</L>
<L>She, from the fir&s;t, when men her pow'r confe&s;t,</L>
<L>When grief and terror &s;eiz'd the tortur'd brea&s;t,</L>
<L>She made, to &s;trike her moral to the mind,</L>
<L>The &s;tage the great tribunal of mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the worthies of each clime &s;he draws,</L>
<L>Who founded &s;tates, or re&s;cued dying laws;</L>
<L>Who, in ba&s;e times, a life of glory led,</L>
<L>And for their country who have toil'd or bled;</L>
<L>Hither they come, again they breathe, they live,</L>
<L>And virtue's meed through ev'ry age receive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the murd'rer comes, with gha&s;tly mien!</L>
<L>And the fiend con&s;cience hunts him o'er the &s;cene.</L>
<L>None are exempted; all mu&s;t re-appear,</L>
<L>And even kings attend for judgement here;</L>
<L>Here find the day, when they their pow'r abu&s;e,</L>

<L>Vigorous he comes, and warm from Shake&s;peare's &s;chool.</L>
<L>In&s;pir'd by him, he &s;hews, in glaring light,</L>
<L>A nation &s;truggling with tyrannic might;</L>
<L>Oppre&s;&s;ion ru&s;hing on with giant &s;trides;</L>
<L>A deep con&s;piracy, which virtue guides;</L>
<L>Heroes, for freedom who dare &s;trike the blow,</L>
<L>A tablature of honour, guilt and woe.</L>

<L>IS it permitted in this age &s;evere,</L>

<L>Nor think, as Zeuxis, for a faultle&s;s piece,</L>

<L>Our bard has center'd in one beauteous whole,</L>

<L>On Britain's and Ierne's &s;hores he &s;aw</L>
<L>The models of the fair he dar'd to draw;</L>
