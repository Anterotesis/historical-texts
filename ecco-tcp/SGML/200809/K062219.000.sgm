<L>HARMODIUS breath'd the rural air, nor found</L>
<L>His ruddy health with length of years decrea&s;e:</L>

<L>His &s;ilver forehead with the wreath of peace:</L>

<L>BY partial nature fram'd in beauty's mould,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with ev'ry grace, un&s;poil'd by art,</L>

<L>ENDEAR'D to all &s;he met, each welcome day,</L>

<L>Was quench'd, untimely, with the gloom of thought.</L>
