<HEAD>MACBETH RECONSIDERED.</HEAD>
<P>PLAYS are de&s;igned, by the joint powers of precept and example, to have a good influence on the lives of men. Enquiries into the conduct of fable in the drama were u&s;e|le&s;s to this end: the regular, or irregular, di&s;po&s;ition of parts in a play is an artificial prai&s;e, or blame, that can contribute nothing to the improvement, or depravation, of the mind; for the cau&s;e of morality is promoted only, when, by a cata&s;trophe re&s;ulting from principles natural to the agents, who produce it, we are taught to love virtue, and abhor|vice.</P>
<P>Neglect of unity is the obvious fault of Shak&s;peare's pieces, truth of manners their unrivalled excellence.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">This E&s;&s;ay does not profe&s;s to ob&s;erve up|on any incon&s;i&s;tency in the conduct of the tragedy of Macbeth, it concerns it&s;elf only with the &s;entiments of the hero of it, pre|&s;uming they will more effectually &s;erve ethicks, if, in analy&s;ing his character, it &s;hews that there is no di&s;tinction between him and king Richard, in the quality of per&s;onal courage. If Macbeth be what Mr. Wheatley de&s;cribes him, we mu&s;t forego our virtuous &s;atisfac|tion in his repugnance to guilt, for it ari&s;es from mere cowardice; and can gain no in|&s;truction from his remor&s;e, for it is only the effect of imbecility; we de&s;pi&s;e him; we cannot feel for him; and &s;hall never be amended by a wretch, who is uniformly the object of our contempt.</P>
<P>The writer of the&s;e pages does not con&s;ider, that his po&s;ition will never be e&s;tabli&s;hed, till Mr. Wheatley's be overthrown, without per|ceiving how difficult, and apparently invidi|ous, a ta&s;k he undertakes; he relies, how|ever, upon Shak&s;peare to clear Macbeth from the imputation laid on his nature; and can truly &s;ay, the argument is not taken up in a &s;pirit of controver&s;y, but out of a love for, what is believed to be, ju&s;t critici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">Having given many judicious proofs of the difference, there certainly is, in the characters of Macbeth and Richard, Mr. Wheatley pro|ceeds to the article of courage, and &s;ays, <HI>In Richard it is intrepidity, and in Macbeth no more than re&s;olution: in him</HI> [Macbeth] <HI>it proceeds from exertion, not from nature; in enterprize he betrays a degree of fear, though he is able, when occa&s;ion requires, to &s;tifle and &s;ubdue it.</HI></P>
<P>The attempt to controvert this doctrine na|turally re&s;olves it&s;elf into three heads; name|ly, a repetition of the &s;imple character of Mac|beth, as it &s;tands before any change is effected in it by the &s;upernatural &s;oliciting of the weird &s;i&s;ters; a con&s;ideration of his conduct towards Banquo, and Macduff; and a review of his deportment, as oppo&s;ed to Richard's in the "Remarks." This order will involve an inquiry into Mr. Wheatley's interpretation of the poet's text; into the appo&s;itene&s;s of the facts adduced in &s;upport of hi opinion; and into his philo&s;ophy of the pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liar pa&s;&s;ion of characters, when, facts not &s;upplying te&s;ti|mony, he can &s;ub&s;tantiate his hypothe&s;is only on the evidence of appropriated &s;entiment.</P>
<P>An appeal for judgement on the nature of Macbeth's courage lies to the tribunal of
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Shak&s;peare him&s;elf. The circum&s;cribed na|ture of a drama renders it generally imprac|ticable for the principal per&s;onages in it gra|dually to unfold them&s;elves; it is, therefore, an allowed artifice with dramatic authors (and of which they commonly avail them&s;elves) by an impre&s;&s;ive de&s;cription of their heroes to bring us, in a great mea&s;ure, acquainted with them, before they are actually engaged in &s;cenes, where, for want of &s;uch previous in|telligence, their proceedings might appear, at be&s;t, confu&s;ed, and generally, perhaps, inex|plicable. We are bound, then, to receive the introductory portrait our author has drawn of Macbeth as a true re&s;emblance; for a crea|ture of the poet's arbitrary creation may be a&s;&s;imilated only to tho&s;e features, which he has thought fit to give him. Here is the picture.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;The mercile&s;s Macdonel</L>
<L>&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;from the we&s;tern i&s;les</L>
<L>Of kernes and gallow-gla&s;&s;es is &s;upply'd;</L>
<L>And fortune, on his damned quarrel &s;miling,</L>
<L>Shew'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</L>
<L>For brave Macbeth, (well he de&s;erves that name)</L>
<L>Di&s;daining fortune, with his brandi&s;h'd &s;teel,</L>
<L>Which &s;moak'd with bloody execution,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">Like valour's minion, carved out his pa&s;&s;age,</L>
<L>'Till he fac'd the &s;lave:</L>
<L>And ne'er &s;hook hands, nor bade farewel to him,</L>
<L>'Till he un&s;eam'd him from the nave to the chops.</L>
<BIBL>(P. 446. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
<P>Could Shak&s;peare call a man brave, and in&s;i&s;t upon his well de&s;erving that appel|lation; could he grace a man with the title of valour's minion, and deem him, as he does in a &s;ub&s;equent pa&s;&s;age, worthy to be match|ed even with the godde&s;s of war;&mdash;could he do this, and not de&s;ign to impre&s;s a full idea of the dignity of his courage? Macbeth's great heart pants to meet the mercile&s;s leader of the rebels; his executing &s;word, all dyed in reek|ing gore, hews out a pa&s;&s;age to him; he main|tains the combat, 'till the death of his anta|goni&s;t crowns his per&s;i&s;tive valour with the victory he burned for.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, Macbeth has <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> not <HI>intre|pidity.</HI> What is the &s;oldier's intrepidity, but di&s;daining fortune?</P>
<P>It is objected, though with &s;ome qualifi|cation, that Macbeth's courage <HI>proceeds from exertion, not from nature;</HI> and that in <HI>enterprize he betrays a deal of fear.</HI> Let us turn to the portrait once more.</P>

<BIBL>(P. 449. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
<P>The Thane of Ro&s;&s;e takes up the narrative;&mdash;
<Q><L>Norway him&s;elf, with terrible numbers,</L>
<L>&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;began a di&s;mal conflict;</L>
<L>'Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapt in proof,</L>
<L>Confronted him with &s;elf-compari&s;ons,</L>
<L>Point again&s;t point rebellious, arm 'gain&s;t arm,</L>
<L>Curbing his lavi&s;h &s;pirit: and to conclude,</L>
<L>The victory fell on us.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>P. 452. v. 4.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Is it to betray fear in enterprize, already worn with the fatigues of a hard-fought field, to ru&s;h, at di&s;advantage, on fre&s;h &s;upplies and terrible numbers, unconcerned as eagles, when they &s;woop on &s;parrows, and lions, when they &s;trike a hare? It cannot be the laboured effect of exertion, it is the &s;pontaneous im|pul&s;e of a dauntle&s;s nature, that again hurries Bellona's bridegroom, through all the horrors of a di&s;mal conflict, to &s;ingle out and hold the royal invader point again&s;t point, till his re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="11">
arm has curbed his lavi&s;h &s;pirit, and rai&s;ed on his di&s;comfiture the trophies of a &s;econd conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Macbeth now enters in the &s;cene, and a deputation from the &s;overeign meets him, with the&s;e gracious acknowledgements to his tri|umphant valour.</P>
<Q><L>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,</L>
<L>The news of thy &s;ucce&s;s: and when he reads</L>
<L>Thy per&s;onal venture in the rebel's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight,</L>
<L>His wonder and his prai&s;es do contend,</L>
<L>Which &s;hould be thine, or his: &s;ilenc'd with that</L>
<L>In viewing o'er the re&s;t o' the &s;elf-&s;ame day,</L>
<L>He finds thee in the &s;tout Norweyan ranks,</L>
<L>Nothing afraid of what thy&s;elf did&s;t make,</L>
<L>Strange images of death. As thick as tale,</L>
<L>Came po&s;t with po&s;t; and every one did bear</L>
<L>Thy prai&s;es in his kingdom's great defence</L>
<L>&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;For an earne&s;t of a greater honour,</L>
<L>He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.</L>
<BIBL>(P. 464. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
<P>The king congratulates Macbeth on his &s;ucce&s;s; and profe&s;&s;es, that the prai&s;e, due to his per&s;onal venture in the fir&s;t battle, is lo&s;t in &s;ilent wonder at the &s;ublimity of his daring. How inexpre&s;&s;ible, then, are Dun|can's feelings, when he finds him once more engaged, the &s;elf-&s;ame day, in the &s;tout
<PB N="10" REF="12">
Norweyan ranks, carele&s;s of meeting that death, which he was &s;o terribly dealing on the &s;quadrons that &s;urrounded him! The king confers the forfeited honours of the di&s;loyal Cawdor upon his general, only as a token of tho&s;e higher dignities, which all con&s;pire to think his atchievements in the kingdom's great defence have ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P>Such is the character Shak&s;peare attributes to Macbeth, while yet the purene&s;s of his con&s;cience is uncontaminated by guilt. The impetuo&s;ity of Glamis is the deci&s;ion of in|trepidity; the feats of his own hand a&s;&s;ure to him the renown of gallantry; and the whole tenour of his conduct, throughout this peril|ous adventure, unequivocally di&s;plays a &s;oul, that, with Othello's, may
<Q><L>&mdash;agnize</L>
<L>A natural and prompt alacrity</L>
<L>It finds in hardne&s;s.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 465. v. 10.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We come now to the &s;econd part of this que&s;tion. The "Remarks" affirm, that <HI>Macbeth is per&s;onally afraid of Banquo,</HI> and that <HI>his fear is founded on the &s;uperior courage of the other.</HI></P>
<P>The evidence, which is given in, of Ban|quo's &s;uperior courage may, perhaps, on ex|amination,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;eem but of little weight. Whence are the proofs of Macbeth's cowardice to be brought? Not from his behaviour in battle. It does not appear, that, <HI>upon the fir&s;t meet|ing of the witches, Macbeth is agitated much more than Banquo;</HI> Banquo's de&s;cription of their figures, and his <HI>&s;everal pertinent que&s;tions</HI> to them (amounting, though, to no more than two) are not expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>mere curio&s;ity,</HI> but of the &s;urpri&s;e, with which him&s;elf and his partner are equally affected, on their un|expectedly encountering three objects of &s;o grote&s;que an appearance,
<Q><L>&mdash; What are the&s;e,</L>
<L>So wither'd, and &s;o wild in their attire;</L>
<L>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</L>
<L>And yet are on't?&mdash;Live you? or are you ought</L>
<L>That man may que&s;tion?&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 406. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
If Macbeth <HI>only repeats the &s;ame inquiry,</HI> it is not from timidity, but from a wi&s;h for the &s;ame information; and when he does it <HI>&s;hortly,</HI> he indicates his impatience for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould the &s;peeches of Macbeth and Banquo, in this &s;cene, <HI>appear to be injudiciou&s;ly di&s;tributed?</HI> And how will <HI>the difference in their characters account for &s;uch a di&s;tribution?</HI> Ban|quo addre&s;&s;es the witches fir&s;t: Banquo is
<PB N="12" REF="14">
made to &s;ee them fir&s;t; not in token of &s;u|periority, but merely, perhaps, that their ceremonious &s;ilence to him,
<Q><L>&mdash; each at once her choppy finger laying</L>
<L>Upon her &s;kinny lips,&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 406. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
may heighten the &s;olemnity of the pro|phetic greeting, with which they are about to hail Macbeth. Yet, the di&s;tribution of the parts is of &s;o little moment, that it might have happened fortuitou&s;ly: to have done, however, with conjecture, the context evinces, that it is not produced for the purpo&s;e of &s;hew|ing Banquo's &s;uperiority, in <HI>being perfectly calm</HI> under an occurrence, that has <HI>ruffled</HI> Macbeth.</P>
<P>If Macbeth <HI>is amazed, when he &s;ees the witches are vani&s;hed,</HI> and likens their di&s;ap|pearance to the melting of breath into the wind; Banquo is &s;truck too, and compares them, in their &s;udden evane&s;cence, to the bur&s;ting bubbles of the water.&mdash;(P. 464. v.4.)</P>
<P>Banquo cannot be &s;aid to <HI>treat the witches with contempt;</HI> he adjures them,&mdash;
<Q>I' the name of truth;&mdash;
<BIBL>(P. 462. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
and, with Macbeth, gives them, in &s;ome &s;ort, credit for
<Q><L>More than mortal knowledge.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15">If you can look into the &s;eeds of time,</L>
<L>And &s;ay, which grain will grow, and which will not;</L>
<L>Speak then to me, who neither beg, nor fear,</L>
<L>Your favours, nor your hate.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 462. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This is the language of manly firmne&s;s, not of contempt. He does not mean to <HI>ridicule their prophecy</HI> by an&s;wering to Macbeth's que&s;tion,
<Q><L>Went it not &s;o?</L>
<L>To the &s;elf-&s;ame tune, and words.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 464. v.4.)</BIBL></Q>
This is a grave, and preci&s;e, reply to a par|ticular, and intere&s;ting, demand. It has been ob&s;erved, from the highe&s;t critical authority, that Malcolm confirms the &s;erious import of the &s;peech in que&s;tion, when he calls the effu&s;ions of Macduff's grief and rage a manly "tune."&mdash;P. 586. v. 4.) It is plain, that Banquo's exclamation&mdash;,
<Q>What, can the devil &s;peak true?&mdash;
<BIBL>(P. 465. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
on hearing part of the prophecy fulfilled, is dictated by wonder, not <HI>di&s;regard;</HI> for, when Macbeth takes occa&s;ion, from that very event, to que&s;tion him on the hope, he now might
<PB N="14" REF="16">rea&s;onably entertain, of his family's advance|ment, he &s;olemnly replies,
<Q><L>&mdash; 'Tis &s;trange;</L>
<L>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</L>
<L>The in&s;truments of darkne&s;s tell us truths;</L>
<L>Win us with hone&s;t trifles, to betray us</L>
<L>In deepe&s;t con&s;equence.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 466. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
Now let us advert to the &s;ub&s;equent effect, which the declarations of the &s;i&s;ters have upon Banquo's mind: he prays to be delivered from their temptations;
<Q><L>&mdash;Merciful powers!</L>
<L>Re&s;train in me the cur&s;ed thoughts, that nature</L>
<L>Gives way to in repo&s;e!&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P.492. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Stevens, to whom every admirer of Shak&s;peare mu&s;t feel him&s;elf under high obli|gations, ob&s;erves upon this pa&s;&s;age, <Q>it is ap|parent from what Banquo &s;ays afterwards</Q>&mdash;[to Macbeth, "I dreamt la&s;t night of the three weird &s;i&s;ters,"]&mdash;<Q>that he had been &s;olicited in a dream to attempt &s;omething, in con&s;equence of the prophecy of the witches, that his waking &s;en&s;es were &s;hock'd at.</Q>&mdash;(P. 492. v. 4.) &mdash;The&s;e horrible emotions could never have been
<PB N="15" REF="17">
cau&s;ed in him by declarations, which he had contemned, ridiculed, or di&s;regarded. The adventure on the heath, therefore, does not prove Banquo's &s;pirit greater than Macbeth's.</P>
<P>The "Remarks" proceed thus, in proof of Macbeth's per&s;onal fear of Banquo; <HI>his principal object is the death of the father; and the &s;ecuring of his crown again&s;t Banquo's i&s;&s;ue, who alone were pointed out to his jealou&s;y by the witches, is no more than a &s;econdary con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>Macbeth, when he <HI>confe&s;&s;es to Lady Mac|beth, that his mind is full of &s;corpions,</HI> &s;hews Banquo not to be the &s;ole cau&s;e of his un|ea&s;ine&s;s, by adding, "Thou know'&s;t, that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives:" Moreover; directing the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he tells them, the &s;on's ab&s;ence is "no le&s;s material" to him, than the father's; he urges the death of Fleance on a motive di&s;tinct from cowardice; for, allowing, one moment, that he per&s;onally fear'd Banquo, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive he could have felt the &s;ame dread of a boy: again; had his fears been per&s;onal they mu&s;t have ended with the removal of the object of them; but finding the &s;on has not fallen with the father, he is again involv'd in all his former apprehen&s;ions.
<Q><PB N="16" REF="18">
<L>Fleance is '&s;cap'd.</L>
<L>Then comes my fit again.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 538. v. 4.)</BIBL></Q>
The witches, it is true, only point out Ban|quo's i&s;&s;ue to Macbeth's jealou&s;y; but acual is not po&s;&s;ible progeny, and the lo&s;s of one child does not prevent a man from begetting others: thus, the &s;ecuring of his crown again&s;t Banquo's i&s;&s;ue is &s;o far from being a <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> that it is the tyrant's only, in&s;tigation to this double murder.</P>
<P>The original idea of Macbeth's per&s;onally fearing Banquo &s;eems founded on the&s;e words;
<Q><L>&mdash; our fears in Banquo</L>
<L>Stick deep;&mdash;</L></Q>
and,
<Q><L>&mdash; There is none, but he,</L>
<L>Who&s;e being I do fear,&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>(P. 522. v, 4.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It will be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, towards ex|plaining the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e &s;trong lines, to fol|low the train of rea&s;oning through the context of the &s;peech, from which they are taken.</P>
<Q><L>To be thus, is nothing;</L>
<L>But to be &s;afely thus:&mdash;Our fears in Banquo</L>
<L>Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</L>
<L>Reigns that, which would be fear'd: 'Tis much he dares;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19">And, to that dauntle&s;s temper of his mind,</L>
<L>He hath a wi&s;dom, that doth guide his valour</L>
<L>To act in &s;afety. There is none, but he,</L>
<L>Who&s;e being I do fear: and, under him,</L>
<L>My genius is rebuk'd; as, it is &s;aid,</L>
<L>Mark Anthony's was by Cae&s;ar. He chid the &s;i&s;ters,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t they put the name of king upon me,</L>
<L>And bade them &s;peak to him; then, prophet-like,</L>
<L>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</L>
<L>Upon my head they plac'd a fruitle&s;s crown,</L>
<L>And put a barren &s;ceptre in my gripe,</L>
<L>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</L>
<L>No &s;on of mine &s;ucceeding. If it be &s;o,</L>
<L>For Banquo's i&s;&s;ue have I fil'd my mind;</L>
<L>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</L>
<L>Put rancours in the ve&s;&s;el of my peace</L>

<P>In this &s;oliloquy the u&s;urper reflects, that, after all he has done to obtain the crown, he is in great danger of lo&s;ing it; weighs the cau&s;es of that danger; and re&s;olves, by re|moving them, to take effectual mea&s;ures for the firmly e&s;tabli&s;hing of his &s;upremacy.

He ru&s;hes upon the enemy&mdash;encounters Mac|duff &mdash;The &s;i&s;ters have palter'd with him; he has done with belief in the juggling fiends, and can rely upon him&s;elf&mdash;

This conduct in Macbeth is &s;tigmatized with the name of <HI>de&s;pair.</HI>&mdash;It certainly is of the &s;ame nature with Richard's determination:
<Q><L>&mdash;I have &s;et my life upon a ca&s;t,</L>

The re&s;olution of both tyrants in the battles, that decided their fate, is that mix'd effu&s;ion of grief, &s;hame, and pride, which cannot be denominated le&s;s than the de&s;pair of innate bravery.</P>
<P>If Macbeth's behaviour is to be called cow|ardly, when, overpowered by the completion of the prophecies, he, for a moment, declines the combat with Macduff; &s;o mu&s;t Richard's, when he flies with Ha&s;tings before Warwick and Somer&s;et, leaving Edward to the mercy of the Lanca&s;trians.&mdash;P. 52<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. v. 6.</P>
<P><HI>From the review of the characters of the u&s;urpers, it appears not to be true of Richard, that</HI> <Q>upon no occa&s;ion, however tremendous, end at no moment of his life, however un|guarded,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
does he betray the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of fear;</Q>&mdash;<HI>or of Macbeth, that he</HI> <Q>is always &s;haken upon great, and frequently upon trivial occa&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>Macbeth and Richard are each of them as intrepid as man can be: yet, it may be &s;aid of each, without any derogation from that character, that he is, at times, agitated with apprehen&s;ions. The Earl of Peterborough has left it upon record, that intrepidity and &s;en&s;e of danger are by no means incompatible.</P>
<P>Having endeavour'd to prove, that Macbeth has a ju&s;t right to the reputation of intre|pidity; that he feels no per&s;onal dread of Ban|quo and Macduff; and that he meets equal, not to &s;ay &s;uperior, trials, as boldly as Rich|ard; it may be expected this e&s;&s;ay &s;hould at|tempt to &s;hew in what the e&s;&s;ential difference between the&s;e great bad men con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Ambition is the impul&s;e that governs every action of Richard's life; he attains the crown by di&s;&s;imulation, that owns no re&s;pect for virtue; and by cruelty, which entails no re|mor&s;e on the va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, that wou'd maintain his ill-acquir'd dignity. Ambition is the predo|minant vice of Macbeth's nature; but he gra|tifies it by hypocri&s;y, that reveres virtue too highly to be perfectly it&s;elf; and by murders,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
the recollection whereof, at times, renders his valour, u&s;ele&s;s by depriving him of all fen&s;e, but that of his enormous wickedne&s;s. Richard's character is &s;imple, Macbeth's mix'd. Richard is only intrepid, Macbeth intrepid, and feeling. Richard's mind not being diverted by reflection from the exigen|cies of his &s;ituation, he is always at full lei&s;ure to di&s;play his valour; Macbeth, di&s;|tracted by remor&s;e, lo&s;es all apprehen&s;ion of danger in the contemplation of his guilt; and never recurs to his valour for &s;upport, till the enemy's approach rouzes his whole &s;oul, and con&s;cience is repell'd by the nece&s;&s;ity for ex|ertion.</P>
<P>The writer of the above pages cannot con|clude without &s;aying, he read the <Q>Remarks on &s;ome of Shak&s;peare's Characters</Q> with &s;o much general plea&s;ure and conviction, that he wi&s;hes his approbation were con&s;iderable enough to increa&s;e the celebrity which Mr. Wheatley's memory has acquir'd from a work, &s;o u&s;efully intended, and &s;o elegantly perform'd.</P>
