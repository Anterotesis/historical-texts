<L>WHEN fir&s;t the children of the Mu&s;e began</L>
<L>To try their magic on the mind of man,</L>
<L>A&s;toni&s;h'd mortals &s;aw, with wond'ring eyes,</L>
<L>The fair creation of the bard ari&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence is deriv'd the Poet's lofty name,</L>
<L>For Poet and Creator mean the &s;ame;</L>
<L>He, from his fancy, where the &s;eeds of things</L>
<L>As in a chaos lie, to order brings</L>
<L>Worlds of his own and builds the lofty rhyme</L>
<L>Who&s;e poli&s;h'd &s;trength defies the rage of time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such were the bards, whom we too call divine,</L>
<L>Homer the father of the godlike line,</L>
<L>The Mantuan bard, whom all mankind admire</L>
<L>For &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion and for ve&s;tal fire.</L>
<L>Shake&s;pear and Milton, both in England born,</L>
<L>Who&s;e glorious names the Queen of I&s;les adorn,</L>
<L>Who, proudly &s;itting on her azure throne,</L>
<L>In arts and empire will no equal own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ,</L>
<L>And would have been, I think, a-writing yet,</L>
<L>Enamour'd of his theme.&mdash;But I drew near,</L>
<L>And whi&s;per'd that of him you wi&s;h'd to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas difficult he &s;aid&mdash;in &s;uch a ca&s;e</L>
<L>He could have wi&s;h'd another in his place;</L>
<L>To tell, with what alternate hopes and fears,</L>
<L>An anxious Author on the Stage appears;</L>
<L>For, like the nightingale, he hath addre&s;t</L>
<L>Him&s;elf to &s;ing&mdash;a thorn at his fond brea&s;t.</L>
<L>If, like the native warbler of the grove,</L>
<L>His plaintive notes are full of tender love;</L>
<L>Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain</L>
<L>And give him &s;pirit for a nobler &s;train.</L>
