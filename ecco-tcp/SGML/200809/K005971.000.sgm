<HEAD>CHAP. I. Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s Vindication of the indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of Cuckol|dom, incumbent upon Wives, in ca&s;e of the Tyranny, Infidelity, or In&s;ufficiency of Husbands: Being a full An&s;wer to the Doctor's Sermon again&s;t <HI>Adultery.</HI></HEAD>
<P>JOHN found daily fre&s;h Proofs of the Infidelity and bad De&s;igns of his deceas'd Wife; among&s;t other Things, one Day looking over his Ca|binet, he found the following Paper.</P>
<Q><P>IT is evident that Matrimony is founded upon an original Contract, whereby the Wife makes over the Right &s;he has by the Law of Nature to the <HI>Con|cubitus vagus,</HI> in favour of the Husband, by which he acquires the Property of all her Po&s;terity; but then the Obligation is mutual: And where the Con|tract is broken on one &s;ide, it cea&s;es to bind on the other; where there is a Right, there mu&s;t be a Power to maintain it, and to puni&s;h the offending Party. This Power I affirm to be that Original Right, or rather that indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of Cuckoldom, lodg'd in all Wives, in the Ca&s;es above-mention'd. No Wife is bound by any Law to which &s;he her &s;elf has not con&s;ented: All Oeconomical Government is lodg'd originally in the Husband and Wife, the executive part being in the Husband, both have their Privi|leges &s;ecur'd to them by Law and Rea&s;on; but will any Man infer from the Husband's being inve&s;ted with the executive Power, that the Wife is depriv'd
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of her Share, and that which is the principal Branch of it, the original Right of Cuckoldom? and that &s;he has no remedy left but <HI>Preces &amp; Lacrymae,</HI> or an Appeal to a &s;upreme Court of Judicature? No le&s;s frivolous are the Arguments that are drawn, from the general Appellations and Terms of Husband and Wife; a Husband denotes &s;everal different &s;orts of Magi&s;tra|cy, according to the U&s;ages and Cu&s;toms of different Climates and Countries; in &s;ome Ea&s;tern Nations it &s;ignifies a Tyrant, with the ab&s;olute Power of Life and Death. In <HI>Turkey</HI> it denotes an Arbitrary Go|vernor, with power of perpetual Impri&s;onment; in <HI>Italy</HI> it gives the Husband the power of Poi&s;on and Padlocks; in the Countries of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> it has quite a different Meaning, implying a free and equal Government, &s;ecuring to the Wife, in certain Ca&s;es, the liberty of Cuckoldom, and the property of Pin-money and &s;eparate Maintenance; &s;o that the Arguments drawn from the terms of Hu&s;|band and Wife are fallacious, and by no means fit to &s;upport a tyrannical Doctrine, as that of ab&s;olute un|limited Cha&s;tity, and conjugal Fidelity.</P>
<P>The general Exhortations to Cha&s;tity in Wives, are meant only for Rules in ordinary Ca&s;es, but they naturally &s;uppo&s;e the three Conditions of Ability, Ju&s;tice and Fidelity, in the Husband; &s;uch an unli|mited, uncondition'd Fidelity in the Wife could ne|ver be &s;uppo&s;ed by rea&s;onable Men; it &s;eems a re|flexion upon the Ch&mdash;ch, to charge her with Doctrines that countenance Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Doctrine of the original Right of Cuckoldom is congruous to the Law of Nature, which is &s;uperior to all human Laws, and for that I dare appeal to all Wives: It is much to the Honour of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wives, that they have never given up that <HI>fundamental Point;</HI> and that tho' in former Ages they were muffled up in Darkne&s;s and Super&s;tition, yet that Notion &s;eem'd engraven on their Minds, and the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;trong, that nothing could impair it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
To a&s;&s;ert the Illegality of Cuckoldom, upon any Pretence what&s;oever, were to ca&s;t odious Colours upon the married State, to blacken the nece&s;&s;ary Means of perpetuating Families: Such Laws can ne|ver be &s;uppos'd to have been de&s;ign'd to defeat the very end of Matrimony, the Propagation of Mankind. I call them nece&s;&s;ary Means, for in many Ca&s;es what other Means are left? Such a Doctrine wounds the Honour of Families, un&s;ettles the Titles to King|doms, Honours and E&s;tates; for if the Actions from which &s;uch Settlements &s;pring were illegal, all that is built upon them mu&s;t be &s;o too; but the la&s;t is ab|&s;urd, therefore the fir&s;t mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e. What is the Cau&s;e that <HI>Europe</HI> groans, at pre&s;ent, under the heavy Load of a cruel and expen&s;ive War, but the tyrannical Cu&s;tom of a certain Nation, and the &s;crupulous Nicety of a &s;illy Quean, in not exerci&s;ing this indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of Cuckoldom, whereby the Kingdom might have had an Heir, and a controverted Succe&s;&s;ion might have been avoided? The&s;e are the Effects of the narrow Maxims of your Clergy, <HI>That one mu&s;t not do Evil, that Good may come of it.</HI></P>
<P>The A&s;&s;ertors of this indefea&s;ible Right, and <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of Matrimony, do all in their Hearts favour Gallants, and the Pretenders to married Women; for if the true legal Foundation of the married State be once &s;ap'd, and in&s;tead thereof tyrannical Ma|xims introduc'd, what mu&s;t follow but Elopements. in&s;tead of &s;ecret and peaceable Cuckoldom?</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid, one may clearly per+ceive the Ab&s;urdity of the Doctrine of this &s;editious di&s;contented, hot-headed, ungifted, unedifying Preacher, a&s;&s;erting, <HI>That the grand Security of the ma+trimonial State, and the Pillar upon which it &s;tands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> founded upon the Wife's belief of an ab&s;olute uncondition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> Fidelity to the Husband's Bed:</HI> By which bold A&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+tion he &s;trikes at the Root, digs the Foundation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> removes the Ba&s;is upon which the Happine&s;s of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

married State is built. As for his per&s;onal Reflexi|ons, I would gladly know who are tho&s;e <HI>Wanton Wives</HI> he &s;peaks of? who are tho&s;e Ladies of high Stations, that he &s;o boldly traduces in his Sermon? It is pretty plain who the&s;e A&s;per&s;ions are aim'd at, for which he de&s;erves the Pillory, or &s;omething wor&s;e.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this Doctrine of the indi&s;pen|&s;able Duty of Cuckoldom, I could deduce the Ex|ample of the wi&s;e&s;t Wives in all Ages, who by the&s;e means have pre&s;erv'd their Husband's Families from Ruin and Oblivion, by want of Po&s;terity; but what has been &s;aid, is a &s;ufficient Ground for puni&s;hing this pragmatical Par&s;on.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The two great Parties of Wives, the <HI>Devoto's</HI> and the <HI>Hitts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine of unlimited Cha&s;tity and Fide|lity in Wives, was univer&s;ally e&s;pous'd by all Husbands, who went about the Country, and made the Wives &s;ign Papers, &s;ignifying their utter Dete|&s;tation and Abhorrence of Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s wicked Doctrine of the indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of Cuckoldom. Some yielded, others refu&s;ed to part with their native Li|berty; which gave ri&s;e to two great Parties among&s;t the Wives, the <HI>Devoto's</HI> and the <HI>Hitts.</HI> Tho' it mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e own'd, the di&s;tinction was more nominal than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eal; for the <HI>Devoto's</HI> would abu&s;e Freedoms &s;ome|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">imes; and tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Hitts,</HI> were often very hone&s;t.

over the Manners of their Wives; that the greate&s;t Security to Husbands was a vigorous Con|&s;titution, good U&s;age of their Wives, and keeping them from Temptation; many Husbands having been Sufferers by their tru&s;ting too much to general Profe&s;&s;ions, as was exemplified in the Ca&s;e of a fooli&s;h and negligent Husband, who tru&s;ting to the Efficacy of this Principle, was undone by his Wife's Elope|ment from him.</P>

<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible, Cou&s;in <HI>Bull,</HI> that you can forget the honourable Maxims of the Family you are come of, and break your word with three of the hone&s;te&s;t be&s;t meaning Per&s;ons in the World, E&s;quire <HI>South, Frog</HI> and <HI>Hocus,</HI> that have &s;acrific'd their Intere&s;t to yours?

<P>I am &s;ure they have left my Family in a bad Condition, we have hardly Money to go to Mar|ket, and no Body will take our Words for Six Pence. A very fine Spark this E&s;quire <HI>South!</HI> My Husband took him in, a dirty, &s;notty-nos'd Boy, it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of half the Servants to attend him, the Rogue did bawl and make &s;uch a noi&s;e: Sometimes he fell in the Fire and burnt his Face, &s;ometimes broke his Shins clambering over the Benches, often pi&s;s'd a-Bed, and always came in &s;o dirty, as if he had been dragg'd thro' the Kennel at a Boarding-School. He lo&s;t his Money at Chuck-Farthing, Shuffle-Cap, and All-Fours; &s;old his Books, pawn'd his Linnen, which we were always forc'd to redeem. Then the whole Generation of him are &s;o in love with Bagpipes and
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Poppet Shows; I wi&s;h you knew what my Husband has paid at the Pa&s;try Cooks and Confectioners, for <HI>Naples</HI> Bi&s;cuit, Tarts, Cu&s;tards, and Sweet-Meats. All this while my Husband con&s;ider'd him as a Gen|tleman of a good Family that had fallen into Decay, gave him good Education, and has &s;ettled him in a good Credible way of Living, having procur'd him, by his Intere&s;t, one of the be&s;t Places of the Country; and what return, think you, does this fine Gentle|man make us? he will hardly give me or my Hu&s;|band a good Word, or a civil Expre&s;&s;ion: In&s;tead of plain Sir and Madam (which, tho' I &s;ay it, is our doe) he calls us <HI>Goody</HI> and <HI>Gaffer</HI> &s;uch a one, that he did us a great deal Honour to Board with us; huffs and dings at &s;uch a rate, becau&s;e we will not &s;pend the little we have left to get him the Title and E&s;tate of Lord <HI>Strutt;</HI> and then, for&s;ooth, we &s;hall have the Honour to be his Woollen-drapers.</P>

<P>Look you, Friend <HI>Diego,</HI> if we Law it on till <HI>Lewis</HI> turns hone&s;t, I am afraid our Credit will run low at <HI>Blackwell-Hall;</HI> I wi&s;h every Man had his own; but I &s;till &s;ay, that Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Money &s;hines as bright, and chinks as well as E&s;quire <HI>South</HI>'s. I don't know any other Hold that we Trade&s;men have of the&s;e great Folks, but their Intere&s;t; buy dear, and &s;ell cheap, and I'll warrant ye you will keep your Cu&s;tomer. The wor&s;t is, that Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Servants have got &s;uch a haunt about that old Rogue's Shop, that it will co&s;t us many a Firkin of &s;trong Beer to bring them back again, and the longer they are in a bad Road, the harder it will be to get them out of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I need not tell you how much <HI>Frog</HI> has been oblig'd to our Family from his Child|hood; he carries his Head high now, but he had never been the Man he is, without our Help. Ever &s;ince the Commencement of this Law-Suit it has been the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Hocus,</HI> in &s;haring our Ex|pences, to plead for <HI>Frog. Poor</HI> Frog, (&s;ays he) <HI>is in hard Circum&s;tances, he has a numerous Family, and lives from Hand to Mouth; his Children don't eat a bit of good Victuals from one Year's end to the other, but live upon Salt Herring, &s;owr Crud, and Bore-cole; he does his utmo&s;t, poor Fellow, to keep things even in the World, and has exerted him&s;elf beyond his Ability in this Law-Suit, but he really has not where-withal to go on. What &s;ignifies this Hundred Pounds, place it upon your &s;ide of the Account; it is a great deal to poor</HI> Frog, <HI>and a Trifle to you.</HI> This has been <HI>Hocus</HI>'s con&s;tant Lan|guage, and I am &s;ure he has had Obligations enough to us to have acted another Part.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hard Circum&s;tances! I &s;wear this is provoking to the la&s;t degree. All the time of the Law-Suit, as fa&s;t as I have Mortgaged, <HI>Frog</HI> has pur|chas'd: From a plain Trade&s;man, with a Shop, Warehou&s;e, and a Country-Hutt, with a dirty Fi&s;h-Pond at the end of it, he is now grown a very rich Country Gentleman, with a noble-landed E&s;tate, noble Palaces, Manors, Parks, Gardens and Farms, finer than any we were ever Ma&s;ter of. Is it not &s;trange, when my Husband disburs'd great Sums every Term, <HI>Frog</HI> &s;hould be purcha&s;ing &s;ome new Farm or Manor? So that if this Law-Suit la&s;ts, he will be far the riche&s;t Man in his Country. What is wor&s;e than all this, he &s;teals away my Cu&s;tomers every Day; I have Twelve of the riche&s;t, and the be&s;t, that have left my Shop by his Per&s;wa&s;ion, and

<P><HI>Frog</HI> is indeed pretty clo&s;e in his Deal|ings, but very hone&s;t: You are &s;o touchy, and take things &s;o hotly, I am &s;ure there mu&s;t be &s;ome Mi&s;take in this.</P>

<P>I Under&s;tand that you are at this time Treating with my Friend <HI>John Bull,</HI> about re&s;toring the Lord <HI>Strutt's</HI> Cu&s;tom, and be&s;ides allowing him certain Privileges of Parks and Fi&s;h-Ponds: I wonder how you, that are a Man that knows the World, can talk with that &s;imple Fellow.

<P>So, &s;o, there it pinches.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How the Guardians of the deceas'd Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s three Daughters came to <HI>John,</HI> and what Advice they gave him; wherein is briefly treated the Characters of the three Daughters: Al&s;o <HI>John Bull</HI>'s An&s;wer to the three Guardians.</HEAD>
<P>I Told you in my fir&s;t Part, that Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> before &s;he departed this Life, had ble&s;s'd <HI>John</HI> with three Daughters; I need not here repeat their Names, nei|ther
<PB N="16" REF="15">
would I willingly u&s;e any &s;candalous Reflections upon young Ladies, who&s;e Reputations ought to be very tenderly handled; but the Characters of the&s;e were &s;o well known in the Neighbourhood, that it is doing them no Injury to make a &s;hort De&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>The Elde&s;t was a termagant, imperious, prodigal. lewd, profligate Wench, as ever breath'd; &s;he u&s;ed to Rantipole about the Hou&s;e, pinch the Children, kick the Servants, and torture the Cats and the Dogs; &s;he would rob her Father's &s;trong Box, for Money to give the young Fellows that &s;he was fond of: She had a noble Air, and &s;omething great in her Mein, but &s;uch a noi&s;ome infectious Breath, as threw all the Servants that dre&s;s'd her into Con&s;umptions; if &s;he &s;melt to the fre&s;he&s;t No&s;egay, it would &s;hrivel and wither as it had been blighted: She us'd to come home in her Cups, and break the <HI>China,</HI> and the Looking-gla&s;&s;es, and was of &s;uch an irregular Tem|per, and &s;o entirely given up to her Pa&s;&s;ion, that you might argue as well with the Northwind, as with her Lady&s;hip; &s;o Expen&s;ive, that the Income of three Dukedoms was not enough to &s;upply her Extrava|gance. <HI>Hocus</HI> lov'd her be&s;t, believing her to be his own, got upon the Body of Mrs. <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Daughter, born a Year after her Si&s;ter, was a peevi&s;h, froward, ill-condition'd Creature as ever was born, ugly as the Devil, lean, haggard, pale, with &s;aucer Eyes, a &s;harp No&s;e and hunch-back'd, but active, &s;prightly and diligent about her Affairs. Her Ill-Complexion was occa&s;ion'd by her bad Diet, which was Coffee, Morning, Noon and Night. She never re&s;ted quietly a Bed, but u&s;ed to di&s;turb the whole Family with &s;hrieking out in her Dreams, and plague them next Day with interpreting them, for &s;he took them all for Go&s;pel. She would cry out Murder, and di&s;turb the whole Neighbourhood; and when <HI>John</HI> came running down Stairs to enquire
<PB N="17" REF="16">
what the Matter was, nothing for&s;ooth, only her Maid had &s;tuck a Pin wrong in her Gown. She turn'd away one Servant for putting too much Oil in her Sallad, and another for putting too little Salt in her Water-Cruel. But &s;uch as by Flattery had procur'd her E&s;teem, &s;he would indulge in the greate&s;t Crimes. Her Father had two Coachmen, when one was in the Coach-box, if the Coach &s;wung but the lea&s;t to one &s;ide, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;hriek &s;o loud, that all the Street concluded &s;he was overturn'd; but tho' the other was eternally Drunk, and had overturn'd the whole Family, &s;he was very angry with her Father for turning him away. Then &s;he u&s;ed to carry Tales and Stories from one to another, till &s;he had &s;et the whole Neighbourhood together by the Ears; and this was the only Diver&s;ion &s;he took plea&s;ure in. She never went abroad, but &s;he brought home &s;uch a bun|dle of mon&s;trous Lyes as would have amaz'd any Mortal, but &s;uch as knew her: Of a Whale that had &s;wallow'd a Fleet of Ships; of the Lyons being let out of the <HI>Tower,</HI> to de&s;troy the Prote&s;tant Religion; of the Pope's being &s;een in a Brandy Shop at <HI>Wap|ping,</HI> and a prodigious &s;trong Man that was going to &s;hove down the <HI>Cupola</HI> of <HI>Paul's;</HI> of Three millions of Five Pound Pieces that E&s;quire <HI>South</HI> had found under an old Wall; of Blazing-Stars, Flying Dra|gons, and abundance of &s;uch Stuff. All the Ser|vants in the Family made high Court to her, for &s;he Domineer'd there, and turn'd out and in whom &s;he pleas'd; only there was an old Grudge between her and Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> whom &s;he mortally hated, and u&s;ed to hire Fellows to &s;quirt Kennel Water upon him as he pa&s;s'd along the Streets, &s;o that he was forc'd con|&s;tantly to wear a Surtout of oil'd Cloath, by which means he came home pretty clean, except where the Surtout was a little &s;canty.</P>
<P>As for the Third, &s;he was a Thief, and a com|mon mercenary Pro&s;titute, and that without any
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Solicitation from Nature, for &s;he own'd &s;he had no Enjoyment. She had no Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, a Prince or a Porter was all one, according as they paid; yea &s;he would leave the fine&s;t Gentleman in the World to go to an ugly pocky Fellow, for Six Pence more. In the practice of her Profe&s;&s;ion &s;he had ama&s;s'd va&s;t Magazines of all &s;orts of Things; &s;he had above Five hundred Suits of fine Clothes, and yet went abroad like a Cynder-Wench: She robb'd and &s;tarv'd all the Servants, &s;o that no Body could live near her.</P>
<P>So much for <HI>John</HI>'s three Daughters, which you will &s;ay were Rarities to be fond of. Yet Nature will &s;how it &s;elf; no Body could blame their Rela|tions for taking care of them, and therefore it was that <HI>Hocus,</HI> with two other of the Guardians, thought it their Duty to take care of the Intere&s;t of the three Girls, and give <HI>John</HI> their be&s;t Advice, before he Compounded the Law-Suit.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hocus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you &s;o &s;hy of late, my good Friend? There's no Body loves you better than I, nor has taken more pains in your Affairs: As I hop'd to be &s;av'd I would do any thing to &s;erve you, I would crawl upon all Four to &s;erve you; I have &s;pent my Health, and paternal E&s;tate in your Ser|vice; I have, indeed, a &s;mall Pittance left, with which I might retire, and with as good a Con&s;ci|ence as any Man. But the thoughts of this di&s;grace|ful Compo&s;ition &s;o touches me to the Quick, that I cannot &s;leep: After I had brought the Cau&s;e to the la&s;t Stroke, that one Verdict more had quite ruin'd old <HI>Lewis</HI> and Lord <HI>Strutt,</HI> and put you in the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing; then to Compound, I can|not bear it. This Cau&s;e was my Favourite, I had &s;et my Heart upon it; it is like an only Child, I cannot endure it &s;hould mi&s;carry: For God &s;ake con&s;ider only to what a di&s;mal Condition old <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
is brought: He is at an end of all his Ca&s;h, his At|torneys have hardly one Trick left, they are at an end of all their <HI>Chicane;</HI> be&s;ides, he has both his Law and his daily Bread now upon Tru&s;t: Hold out only one Term longer, and, I'll warrant you, before the next, we &s;hall have him in the <HI>Fleet.</HI> I'll bring him to the Pillory, his Ears &s;hall pay for his Per|juries; for the Love of God don't Compound, let me be Damn'd if you have a Friend in the World that loves you better than I; there is no Body can &s;ay I am Covetous, or that I have any Intere&s;t to pur&s;ue but yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>2</HI>d Guardian.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing &s;o plain, than that this <HI>Lewis</HI> has a de&s;ign to Ruin all his neighbouring Trade&s;men, and at this time he has &s;uch a prodi|gious Income, by his Trade of all kinds, that if there is not &s;ome &s;top put to his Exorbitant Riches, he will Monopolize every thing, and no Body will be able to &s;ell a Yard of Drapery or Mercery Ware but him&s;elf. I therefore hold it advi&s;able, that you continue the Law-Suit, and bur&s;t him at once. My Concern for the three poor Motherle&s;s Children ob|liges me to give you this Advice, for their E&s;tates, poor Girls, depend upon the Succe&s;s of this Cau&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>3</HI>d Guardian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own this Writ of Ejectment has co&s;t dear, but then con&s;ider it is a Jewel well worth the Purcha&s;ing, at the Price of all you have. None but Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>'s declar'd Enemies can &s;ay he has any other Security for his Cloathing Trade, but the Ejectment of Lord <HI>Strutt.</HI> The only Que&s;tion then that remains to be decided, is, Who &s;hall &s;tand the: Expences of the Suit? To which the An&s;wer is as plain, Who but he that is to have the Advantage of the Sentence? When E&s;quire <HI>South</HI> has got Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his Title and Honour, is not <HI>John Bull</HI> to be his Clothier? Who then but <HI>John</HI> ought to put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? Ask but any indifferent Gentleman
<PB N="20" REF="19">
who ought to bear his Charges at Law? and he will readily an&s;wer, his Trade&s;men. I do therefore affirm, and I will go to Death with it, that, being his Clothier, you ought to put him in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his E&s;tate, and with the &s;ame generous Spirit you have begun it, compleat the good Work. If you per&s;i&s;t in the bad Mea&s;ures you are now in, what mu&s;t be|come of the three poor Orphans? My Heart bleeds for the poor Girls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are all very eloquent Per&s;ons, but give me leave to tell you, that you expre&s;s a great deal of more Concern for the three Girls than for me; I think my Intere&s;t ought to be con&s;ider'd in the fir&s;t place. As for you, <HI>Hocus,</HI> I can't but &s;ay you have managed my Law-Suit with great Addre&s;s, and much to my Honour; and, tho' I &s;ay it, you have been well paid for it; never was Attornies Bill more Extravagant, and, give me leave to &s;ay, there are many Articles which the mo&s;t griping of your Pro|fe&s;&s;ion never demanded. I have tru&s;ted you with the disbur&s;ing great Sums of Money, and you have con&s;tantly &s;unk &s;ome into your own Pocket. I tell you I don't like that Sinking. Why mu&s;t the Bur|then be taken off <HI>Frog</HI>'s Back, and laid upon my Shoulders? He can drive about his own Parks and Fields in his gilt Chariot, when I have been forc'd to Mortgage my E&s;tate! his Note will go farther than my Bond! Is it not Matter of Fact, that from the riche&s;t Trade&s;man in all the Country, I am re|duced to beg and borrow from Scriveners and U&s;u|rers, that &s;uck the Heart, Blood and Guts out of me, and what was all this for? Did you like <HI>Frog</HI>'s Countenance better than mine? Was not I your old Friend and Relation? Have I not Pre&s;ented you nobly? Have I not clad your whole Family? Have you not had an Hundred Yards at a time, of the fine&s;t Cloath in my Shop? Why mu&s;t the re&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="20">
of the Trade&s;men be not only indemnified from Charges, but forbid to go on with their own Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and what is more their Concern than mine? As to holding out this Term, I Appeal to your own Con&s;cience, has not that been your con&s;tant Di&s;|cour&s;e the&s;e Six Years, one <HI>Term more, and old</HI> Lewis <HI>goes to Pot;</HI> if thou art &s;o fond of my Cau&s;e, be ge|nerous for once, and lend me a brace of Thou&s;ands. Ah <HI>Hocus! Hocus!</HI> I know thee, not a Sous to &s;ave me from Goal, I trow. Look ye, Gentlemen, I have liv'd with Credit in the World, and it grieves my Heart, never to &s;tir out of my Doors, but to be pull'd by the Sleeve by &s;ome Ra&s;cally Dun, or another: <HI>Sir, Remember my Bill: There's a &s;mall Con|cern of a Thou&s;and Pounds, I hope you think on't, Sir.</HI> And to have the&s;e U&s;urers tran&s;act my Debts at Coffee-Hou&s;es and Ale-Hou&s;es, as if I were going to break-up Shop. Lord! That ever the Rich, the Generous <HI>John Bull,</HI> Clothier, the Envy of all his Neighbours, &s;hould be brought to Compound his Debts for Five Shillings in the Pound; and to have his Name in an Adverti&s;ement, for a Statute of Bankrupt. The Thoughts of it makes me Mad. I have read &s;ome-where in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> That one &s;hould not <HI>con&s;ult with a Woman touching her, of whom &s;he is Jealous; nor with a Merchant, concerning Ex|change, nor with a Buyer, of Selling; nor with an unmer|ciful Man of Kindne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. I could have added one thing more; <HI>Nor with an Attorney, about Compounding a Law-Suit.</HI> This Ejectment of Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> will ne|ver do. The Evidence is Crimp; the Witne&s;&s;es &s;wear backwards and forwards, and Contradict them|&s;elves, and his Tenants &s;tick by him. If it were pra|cticable, is it rea&s;onable, that when E&s;quire <HI>South</HI> is lo&s;ing his Money to Sharpers and Pick-Pockets, going about the Country with Fidlers and Buffoons, and &s;quandring his Income with Hawks and Dogs,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
I &s;hould lay out the Fruits of my hone&s;t Indu&s;try in a Law-Suit for him, only upon the hopes of be|ing his Clothier? and when the Cau&s;e is over, I &s;hall not have the Benefit of my Project, for want of Money to go to Market. Look ye, Gentlemen, <HI>John Bull</HI> is but a plain Man; but <HI>John Bull</HI> knows when he is ill u&s;ed. I know the Infirmity of our Family; we are apt to play the Boon-Companion, and throw away our Money in our Cups: But it was an unfair thing in you, Gentlemen, to take Advantage of my Weakne&s;s, to keep a parcel of roaring Bulleys about me, Day and Night, with Huzza's, and Hunting-Horns, and Ringing the Changes on Butchers Cleavers; never to let me cool, and make me &s;et my Hands to Papers, when I could hardly hold my Pen. There will come a Day of Reckoning for all that Proceeding. In the mean time, Gentlemen, I beg you will let me into my Affairs a little, and that you would not grudge me very &s;mall Remainder of a very great E&s;tate.</P>

<P>THE Arguments us'd by <HI>Hocus,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Guardians, had hitherto prov'd in&s;uffi|cient. <HI>John</HI> and his Wife could not be per&s;waded to bear the Expence of E&s;quire <HI>South</HI>'s Law-Suit. They thought it rea&s;onable, that &s;ince he was to have the Honour and Advantage, he would bear the greate&s;t Share of the Charges; and retrench what he lo&s;t to Sharpers, and &s;pent upon Country-Dances, and Puppet-Plays, to apply it to that u&s;e.

The Necklaces, Dia|mond Cro&s;&s;es, and rich Bracelets that were offer'd, &s;he rejected with the utmo&s;t Scorn and Di&s;dain.
