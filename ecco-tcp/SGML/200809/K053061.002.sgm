<P>DR.

I charge you not to venture too &s;oon to exert it. Rather let me be two or three days <HI>without</HI> your agree|able favours, than <HI>with</HI> them at the co&s;t of your inconvenience: I will endeavour to &s;upport the lo&s;s of your corre&s;pondence, in the hope that your health may be the &s;ooner re&s;tored: and as I my&s;elf get better every hour, I will do my be&s;t to entertain you with a double portion of packets.</P>
<P>Am I not grown a great philo&s;o|pher? do I not at la&s;t acquie&s;ce in your own &s;y&s;tem? do I not obey your inhibitions with even a &s;cru|pulous ceremony? and am I not a mere corre&s;pondent? am I not the cold creature you wi&s;h me?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">Yes Charlotte, I will yield to your punctilious principles. I will not murmur, nor will attempt again to invade your repo&s;e by de&s;iring a per&s;onal interview, till the way to it is &s;moothed by providence. That this will be the ca&s;e, I am certain. In the mean time I will endeavour to be contented with this remote, yet en|dearing intercour&s;e, though Melbank has been labouring to per&s;uade me it would be more for the health of my mind and body that I dropt the plea|&s;ures of the pen.

<HEAD>LETTER LXVII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Templeton has tran&s;mitted to me a little rural poem, written by a literary friend of his: there is a novelty in the &s;tory, and

a &s;implicity in the &s;entiment, that par|ticularly recommends it to per&s;ons of feeling. For this rea&s;on I am going to tran&s;cribe it for your peru&s;al.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIX.</HI> From the &s;ame to <HI>HAMLET TEMPLETON,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WHAT mu&s;t I do, Mr. Tem|pleton? I am under an em|barra&s;&s;ment, from the pains of which I can by no means di&s;engage my&s;elf? Will <HI>you,</HI> who are in &s;ome degree a party concerned, give me your advice. To cut &s;hort the idle formalities of ceremonious introduction, I mu&s;t open to you the nature of my dilemma at once. Would you believe it, Mr. Templeton; while I have been attempting to cure Charles,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
I have been my&s;elf wounded by Char|lotte: yes, Sir, widower as I am, again am I caught in the nets of beauty and merit, and am vainly trying every po&s;&s;ible effort to forget the form that undid my repo&s;e." I have already been led into meane&s;&s;es by this clan|de&s;tine pa&s;&s;ion: it has urged me to de&s;ire Charlotte to forbear writing, under pretence of its interfering with my endeavours to re&s;tore Charles's health. I have vi&s;ited this lovely wo|man &s;everal times, and have had the mortification to hear her heave a thou|&s;and &s;ighs, and to &s;ee her &s;hed a thou|&s;and tears; although &s;he &s;till remains &s;ixt in her re&s;olution of never again uniting her&s;elf to him, I have not had the courage to hint at my parti|ality;
<PB N="16" REF="18">
and to tell you the truth, Sir, I am witheld from &s;uch declarations from various motives. I have con|ceived a tender e&s;teem for Charles, and I am unwilling to give him pain. I con&s;ider my&s;elf as &s;tanding in a very delicate light, and I know not how I can reconcile the different cha|racters of a &s;urgeon, a friend, and a lover. I fairly confe&s;s to you, I never &s;aw any woman &s;o formed to plea&s;e, as Charlotte: as to her having been connected with another, were not that other Charles, I &s;hould make that no objection to offer her at once my heart, hand, and for|tune. My profe&s;&s;ion is merely an object of my choice, not of nece&s;|&s;ity, and I have an income that could
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;upport the woman of my affections affluently. Were it not for the ap|pearance of duplicity, which I can|not bear, I &s;hould certainly make &s;uch overtures to Charlotte, as might put both my love and my principles out of di&s;pute. Such a woman, Sir, would grace the arms, and ble&s;s the heart, of a monarch; and I &s;hould rejoice to lead her by the hand into the embraces of all my family, and all my friends.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, what can I do? would not &s;uch advances, coming thus &s;uddenly from me, look like taking advantages of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;eparation? Charles's tenderne&s;s is too palpable! Charlotte's love is by
<PB N="18" REF="20">
no means worn off. I &s;ee them both every day, and I every day find in both fre&s;h excellencies which it would be inhuman to injure. Who knows what may happen! Cleora may die; many events, may, under the direc|tion of an indulgent god, au&s;piciou&s;ly concur to bring Charles and Charlotte once more into the arms of each other. I may be looked upon as an u&s;urper, as a &s;upplanter of affection: and what makes the matter &s;till wor&s;e, is, that I have very lately done my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of accommodating Charles with what the world con&s;iders an im|portant favour. I have lent him money; it is therefore the wor&s;t time in the world to make propo&s;als. The poor lad's nerves too, are at pre&s;ent all

<P>"My mother, Madam, loved her hu&s;band &s;o much better than her own life, that in the phrenzy of af|fection, &s;he was frequently prevented from making a &s;acrifice to his a&s;hes, of that beautiful form on which he had doated: time, however, brought her u&s;ual lenitive, and the widow began at length to think it her duty to &s;hare the poverty and misfortunes that was by this event, entailed upon her child.

With|out &s;carce knowing what I was about, I told him the incoherent &s;tory, but told it to the heart&mdash;and never &mdash;no, Madam&mdash;by my &s;oul, never &s;hall I forget the anxious air, and melting tone with which he &s;aid&mdash;Talk no more, poor youth, talk no more, but quickly lead me to your mother.

<P>"This worthy &s;tranger buried my mother with all the attention, and &s;acred decency, due to a parent of his own; and, for a long time after|wards, he &s;upplied me with every thing that cou'd &s;ooth the mind, or comfort the body. But, alas! this refuge was &s;oon taken from me; the gentleman died &s;uddenly, and I was once more left upon the wide world, an orphan, without a friend. I was now reduced to &s;eek for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="41" REF="43">
in the capacity of a &s;ervant, and had the good fortune to be taken in by a nneighbouring apothecary for the me|nial purpo&s;e of carrying out his drugs.

<P>"Of this, indeed, I did not hear, till I had &s;pent the whole fortune; for Maria had never &s;een the young man, and his uncle never &s;poke of him to her. Since I have known the fact, I have vainly endeavoured to find the youth, that I might make

him amends; but my re&s;earches have not been yet rewarded, and the apo|thecary's old friends tell me they be|lieve he is dead."</P>
<P>"A fooli&s;h ambition is, I believe, hereditary to my family.

I give you leave to laugh at me, when I tell you, that I cropt clo&s;e to my ears, a fine flowing head of hair, to &s;urround my lunatic pate by a &s;et of enormous curls, ri&s;ing, in formidable exact|ne&s;s, tier above tier, in all the ma|je&s;ty of a phy&s;ician. I became per|fect in the pat on the &s;nuff-box, the management of the graver mu&s;cles, and the &s;wing of the cane: I knew the &s;everal u&s;es of the watch. I af|fected

<PB N="47" REF="49">
put me into &s;uch a trembling, that, (as I held the lancet un&s;teadily) I rambled from the vein, and fairly cut a &s;lice from the brawny part of the arm: the patient, who was a &s;tout fellow, &s;tarted up enraged, and, &s;wear|ing that I knew no more how to bleed a man than his trowel, hopp'd out of the &s;hop in &s;earch of an abler operator&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the&s;e igno|minious te&s;timonies of my ignorance, I was ob&s;tinate enough to per&s;i&s;t, till partly by pomp, and partly by va|nity, I exhau&s;ted poor Maria's whole fortune: from this time I involved my dear contented girl in the effects of my folly, and we were both, for a long time, the dupes of caprice, and the &s;laves of apology. Reflec|tion,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
and the remor&s;e attending it, threw me upon the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and <HI>then</HI> it was that Maria hired a nur&s;e to wait upon me, while <HI>&s;he</HI> made application, and wrote circular appeals to the mo&s;t opulent of her ac|quaintance. She undertook this mo&s;t irk&s;ome of all human engagements unknown to me; and it was not till after I got much better in my health, that &s;he informed me of her mi&s;car|riage. Though I &s;hould have thought it impo&s;&s;ible to turn the deaf ear to &s;uch a creature's reque&s;t, yet &s;he &s;ucceeded, as people of both &s;exes ge|nerally do upon the like occa&s;ions.

<P>"By this time I felt my folly in all the bitterne&s;s of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e calamities my wife was far advanced in her pregnancy, when &s;he fell down &s;tairs, hurried on a premature labour, and died in my arms in the evening of the ninth day&mdash;I was many times tempted to deeds of impiety and de&s;pair; and, having my affairs in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, I went on board a tender, and, with very little money in my pocket more than would pay my pa&s;&s;age (and even that obtained by the &s;ale of my drugs&mdash;for alas!

<P>"As if fortune was once more re|&s;olved to befriend me, I was in the very &s;hip with, a man of the fir&s;t eminence as a &s;urgeon, and of very con&s;iderable property, who had been to England to take <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of that property. His humanity was equal to his ingenuity: my hi&s;tory endeared me to him: he offered me his pity; and before we had arrived at the i&s;land, an accident happened that changed that pity into the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip."</P>

&s;tooping till I was even with the water, I dipt in my arms, while another man had girt a rope round my middle, and by cla&s;ping the poor exhau&s;ted &s;urgeon in my arms with all my violence, the man above, fa&s;t|ened the rope to a pully, and, at the ri&s;que of almo&s;t cutting me in two, for I was re&s;olved not to let go my hold, drew us both up together.&mdash; From henceforward this gentleman and I were as brothers: for near five years, and a half he in every re&s;pect treated me as &s;uch: I &s;tudied with the utmo&s;t diligence under his tuition in the art of anatomy&mdash;I at|tended him over all the i&s;lands in every ca&s;e, and to every patient, and in the end I became a tolerable pro|ficient.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIX. CHARLES to H. T. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>I WRITE this letter to you in a place of confinement, to which I was carried, ju&s;t as I was preparing to walk abroad for the fir&s;t time &s;ince my illne&s;s. The &s;hock has returned upon me a violent fever; by &s;ome means or other I fainted away in the coach, from &s;urprize and weakne&s;s; and, I now find the dre&s;|&s;ing has left my wound, and I am in a great deal of mi&s;ery. This is the more unfortunate, as I am re|&s;olved not to let either Melbank or
<PB N="66" REF="68">
Charlotte know a &s;yllable about my &s;ituation: I have been already too much obliged by the one, and I cannot bear to be for ever racking the genero&s;ity of the other. How any of my creditors could po&s;&s;ibly de|tect my retreat, &s;eque&s;ter'd as it was, and apart from all my former con|nections, I cannot gue&s;s: evident enough it is, I <HI>am</HI> in pri&s;on, and for a debt of all others the lea&s;t re|collected, becau&s;e I do not now &s;uffer for my&s;elf, but for having made my&s;elf fooli&s;hly an&s;werable for the extravagance of another: yet the creditor is a very humane man, and &s;ome cruel tamperings mu&s;t have been u&s;ed with him, before he could be brought to this mea&s;ure.

however, into the&s;e points is ab&s;urd. I am a mo&s;t unfortunate man, and the hand of adver&s;ity is eternally upon me.</P>
<P>Since I came hither, I read your letter upon the &s;ubject of Charlotte's marriage. Ah! Mr. Templeton, how does <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> &s;tand arm'd again&s;t the welfare of <HI>&s;ocial?</HI> But &s;ickne&s;s, and acute di&s;tre&s;s, hath, perhaps, mended both my heart and my ideas.

compleated. Yes, dear Templeton, I now behold my&s;elf with an impar|tial eye&mdash;as a triumph to my ene|mies, as an angui&s;h to my friends&mdash; as a di&s;tre&s;s to tho&s;e who have ever connected them&s;elves with me. I blu&s;h to examine this picture of the truth, and the only atonement I can make, is to make a decent retreat from con&s;cious error at once. In the fir&s;t place, Templeton, let me endeavour, though very late, to do ju&s;tice to Charlotte. A friend of yours, with all the advantages of birth, fortune, virtues, and a genteel profe&s;&s;ion, will marry her&mdash;will lead her by the hand, you &s;ay, and offer her terms of tenderne&s;s and honour.

<P>FINDING my&s;elf perfectly &s;tout, and my wound free from any pain, I have been bold enough to make an excur&s;ion into the country, ju&s;t within reach of the penny-po&s;t, through who&s;e medium I &s;end this, and <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;end my fu|ture letters to you, and to Charlotte.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLOTTE. <HI>(Inclo&s;ed.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE le&s;&s;ons of Charlotte, have at length brought Charles to a real &s;en&s;e of right and wrong: he has deliberated upon his duty &s;everal &s;olitary hours, and the re&s;ult of the whole is a plain conviction, that his continuing to corre&s;pond with her, is highly culpable. His weakne&s;s is con&s;tantly urging him to mix with his &s;entiments, the expre&s;&s;ions of love, all which &s;erve to fan a fire, that might otherwi&s;e be con&s;umed. Charles is at la&s;t certain, that he is doing his fair friend an injury by this
<PB N="76" REF="78">
conduct. He is per&s;uading her to cheri&s;h a hople&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t con&s;equently make her very unhappy. Were &s;he left to the drift of her own prudence and wi&s;dom, they would &s;oon conquer a fatal flame, which is perhaps acquiring fre&s;h force from being thus indirectly cheri&s;hed. She is by the&s;e means al&s;o, kept out of tho&s;e elegant circles which are &s;o innocent, &s;o advantageous, and &s;o agreeable to female youth. Perhaps, if &s;he were to go more into the world, &s;he might meet the man whom &s;he might yet like&mdash;whom &s;he might honour with the name and privileges of a hu&s;band. The cur&s;e that attends Charles, may not attend another, and the advantages
<PB N="77" REF="79">
of marriage, though, in real fact, they may not, in particular ca&s;es, contribute much to purity of <HI>heart,</HI> contribute infinitely to worldly re|putation. Charles is become &s;en&s;ible of what Charlotte ought to do, &s;hould &s;he receive advances of this honour|able nature. As it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould act unkindly to any man, &s;o, if any man of fortune, good temper, and good &s;en&s;e, &s;hould addre&s;s her, it is the mo&s;t &s;erious advice of Charles, that &s;he could indulge him with encouragement. Blinded no longer by the mi&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, he can now &s;ee the train of de&s;ireable con&s;equences attendant upon &s;uch a &s;tep. He &s;ees the amiable Charlotte

care&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who before had the in&s;olence to &s;neer.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves the beautiful martyr embraced by tho&s;e who lately kept aloof: the very virtue and excellence, over which affected &s;tate and haughty cha&s;tity before triumphed, is now congratulated, complimented, and applauded.</P>
<P>She will, therefore, weigh the&s;e important articles, and whenever they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to her ac|ceptance, it is the hope of Charles, that &s;he will not refu&s;e them. That &s;he may be tortured with no more improper &s;entiments, but lay &s;uch as

<P>SINCE the mo&s;t fortunate circum|&s;tance that ever befel you, next to the <HI>marriage</HI> with my father, ('twere nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that I mean his <HI>death</HI>) I have been &s;itting down many times, to write to you; &s;ome|times in the ardour of an hone&s;t re|&s;entment, and &s;ometimes, as a plead|ing, neglected child: but I have re|mained &s;ilent, even yet, an left you uncontrouled to the luxury of your
<PB N="83" REF="85">
good &s;ucce&s;s, and of my anxieties. But your con&s;cience now &s;eems quite brought over to your &s;ide, and I can no longer &s;uffer you to triumph, ei|ther in the benefit of my inheritance, or in the warm and wicked comforts of a wealthy widowhood&mdash;(oh! what a robe of mourning has yours been madam) without trying upon you, the force of truth, and remon&s;trance: &mdash; without exerting one de&s;perate experiment upon a heart, which ha|bit and nature &s;eem impregnantly to have fortified (as if it were the citadel of cruelty) again&s;t all the artillery of the parent, and of the woman!</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">The artifice and complottings, by which my de&s;truction has been effected, are not unknown to me&mdash; How is it, Mrs. P. that you are able to reconcile to your&s;elf, at the fore|boding age of &s;ixty-three, actions, of a colour &s;o atrocious, that the penitence of your youth upwards were &s;carce &s;ufficient to wipe away? by what ca&s;ui&s;try have you pacified every private monition; and how &s;kilful mu&s;t have been that &s;ophi&s;try, by the magic of which, you are ca|pable of &s;itting compo&s;ed, at the head of a table, which you have <HI>&s;tolen</HI> from your child? but why do I interrogate? 'tis a maxim in mo|rality, that a bad woman has no <HI>limit</HI> to her crimes. You are gone
<PB N="85" REF="87">
too far to recede; and I have no hope that you will mend in the progre&s;|&s;ion, but expect that you mu&s;t ga|ther guilt, as you go onward to the grave, till it &s;hall be the plea&s;ure of providence (in mercy to <HI>me</HI> and <HI>mankind</HI>) to confine you there.</P>
<P>You accu&s;e me to your acquaint|ance, of wildne&s;s, and profu&s;ion!

<PB N="86" REF="88">
without &s;ome <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of occa&s;ion, would have argued a temper too mon&s;trous to have been ranked among women; and the very boys would, in mere vengeance, have &s;toned the <HI>inhuman mother.</HI> But de|pend upon it, the &s;ick pillow, will be to you a pillow of plagues: your bed, a bed of torture; and every feather there, will prove a thorn to torment you! Is this the language of lunacy? is it the violence of phrenzy? No, madam: faithful to the injuries of its ma&s;ter, this vin|dictive hand has hitherto confined it&s;elf to &s;entiments of the mo&s;t <HI>frigid moderation.</HI> From this moment, I cut you away from the in&s;ulted &s;en|&s;ibilities of affection: when nature di&s;|cards
<PB N="87" REF="89">
you, what claim can you have upon the heart of a &s;on? and yet, do not think, I mean to forget you &s;o far as to leave you to your&s;elf. Believe me, madam, the day of &s;uch voluptuou&s;ne&s;s is pa&s;t; and although you have robbed me of every right which &s;hould at lea&s;t have divided with you the comforts of the world, I will henceforward take care, that you &s;hall no more enjoy them, with|out the heavie&s;t tax of indignant re|probation.</P>
<P>Your argument with my poor father was always in the &s;ame &s;tyle: "I &s;hould &s;pend his fortune." With what parental piety have you pro|vided again&s;t this! but even grant|ing
<PB N="88" REF="90">
it <HI>had</HI> been &s;o: had I not on my &s;ide the claims of nature and of blood? and what were <HI>your</HI> claims, madam?

Con|&s;ider your &s;hattered fortunes, at the time of your matriculation into my father's family.

whom the maxims of &s;ordid courte&s;y oblige to receive the <HI>hated gue&s;t</HI> into company? nay, have not many of the&s;e openly di&s;covered their indignation? has not your brother, the good Mr. S &mdash;, of|ten &s;poke warmly and di&s;dainfully again&s;t the cruelties, which, at once mark and &s;tain the character of &s;i&s;ter and of chri&s;tian? has not your u&s;age to the unhappy writer of this letter, even in the &s;oft moment of unoffending infancy, been the re|mon&s;trance of the rich, and the pro|verb of the poor? did not your inhu|manity "grow with my growth, and &s;trengthen with my &s;trength," till I was three times compelled to find re|&s;ource from the unkindne&s;s of a mo|ther,

<P>MELBANK, is like one of tho&s;e glorious phoenomena which awes <HI>us</HI> weaker, and more imperfect mortals, into &s;ilence.

<P>I find Charlotte, we mu&s;t not in|dulge our&s;elves in any more inter|views&mdash;they are treacherous&mdash;they betray us. Let us endeavour to be contented with our u&s;ual plea&s;ures of corre&s;ponding: let us follow &s;trictly the advice of our friend. I am weak enough to confe&s;s to you, that I am more rejoiced at Dr. M&mdash;'s noble conque&s;t over him&s;elf, than at any thing I ever felt &s;ince my exi&s;tence. Had he married you&mdash;had he doubled my ob&s;tacles&mdash;had he taken you for ever from me&mdash;or had the cruel cer|tainty
<PB N="151" REF="153">
of your being wife to another attended me&mdash;God knows, how I &s;hould have &s;upported it.</P>
<P>All his genero&s;ity&mdash;even though he had thrown his whole fortune into my lap&mdash;would have &s;hrunk before me; and &s;uch is the incon&s;i&s;tence of a tender heart &mdash;although I was my|&s;elf the propo&s;er and promoter of the union, had it been carried into exe|cution, I believe I &s;hould have hated him, and hang'd my&s;elf. But as it is, I could build churches, and erect monuments to his memory: he has &s;aved me from de&s;peration: he has made me able to bear Charlotte's ab|&s;ence.

All the&s;e things were, I own, very lately, con&s;idered as too little&mdash;but adver&s;ity brings us to a proper &s;en&s;e of rational ble&s;&s;ings; and the pro&s;pect of ever|la&s;tingly lo&s;ing the tenderne&s;s of Char|lotte, has made me &s;atisfied with <HI>that,</HI> which at pre&s;ent <HI>ought</HI> to &s;atisfy me.

(to &s;o tender a heart as your's) the recital of it; e&s;pecially as it will &s;hew you, that there are agonies in life, compared to which, <HI>ours</HI> are tran&s;ient and trifling.

<P>Soon after I was arre&s;ted by Mr. Trap, and conveyed to his hou&s;e, I beheld a young man &s;itting in a very pen&s;ive po&s;ture, re&s;ting his cheek up|on

one hand, and holding a pen in the other. He was not at all di&s;|concerted at my being brought in, but &s;mothered the &s;ighs as well as he was able, and began to write. "There's more &s;tuff in the office, ma&s;ter, &s;aid a fellow that now en|tered the room&mdash;there's two or three more of the <HI>roe</HI> and <HI>doe</HI> family come to vi&s;it you&mdash;it is a &s;ad thing to be &s;ure, but, <HI>how&s;omdever,</HI> you &s;hall not go over the water to-night; you are every inch a <HI>Gemmun,</HI> I will &s;ay that, and you &s;pend your money like a prince.

<P><PB N="156" REF="158">Upon this Charlotte, the poor young man looked up, di&s;covered his eyes &s;wimming in tears, drew a handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it over his face.</P>
<P>Having a little recovered him&s;elf, he took up the pen again, and ju&s;t as he was applying it to the paper, his features a&s;&s;umed &s;omething of con&s;olation: but this again, was pre|&s;ently da&s;hed by the appearance of the bailiff's wife, although, to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he was a very obliging woman.</P>

&s;o by the peculiar circum&s;tances which introduce them, that they would &s;eem di&s;gu&s;ting, though they were to be delivered by the lips of the graces.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trap therefore, was as gra|cious as it is po&s;&s;ible for any one to be, who pre&s;ents a <HI>bill</HI> that requires to be di&s;charged on the &s;pot. Her harangue was to the following ef|fect.</P>

<P>TEN days have I taken to compo&s;e an agitated, and, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, infatuated mind. I have engaged my&s;elf with unu&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity in the bu&s;ine&s;s of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion&mdash;I have read&mdash;I have written &mdash;I have idled, I have toiled.&mdash;

<P>Mr. Reynold's &s;at down, and be|gan. The continuation of his nar|rative ran thus.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin this part of my hi&s;|tory at the day I obtained, after vari|ous delightful difficulties, the hand of my beloved Lucia, who, being only a farmer's daughter, was con|&s;idered by my mother (who can match your's for cruelty) as an intruder in the family, and therefore took every opportunity to in&s;ult her. This contemptuous treatment made us re&s;olve to leave her hou&s;e, and ra|ther
<PB N="179" REF="181">
earn our bread by daily labour, than be indebted for it to one who was con&s;tantly upbraiding us for the bounty. As I was not bred to any bu&s;ine&s;s, I was obliged to &s;eek for &s;uch an employment, as depended rather on the application and ver|&s;atility of genius, than any thing el&s;e. Having a well grounded cla&s;&s;ical education, and a &s;prightly vein for undetached compo&s;itions, I was ad|vi&s;ed, by a young friend who knew the town, to apply to the book&s;ellers, and endeavour to get a livelihood from the pur&s;uits of the pre&s;s; while my poor Lucia was to throw in her mite, by attending to the needle. With the&s;e views, and only three guineas and a half in our pockets, we
<PB N="180" REF="182">
left this cruel mother's hou&s;e one evening pretty late, (taking advant|age of her ab&s;ence from home) and &s;et out to a neighbouring town, from whence we embarked in a waggon for London. Upon our arrival there, we called on our young metropolitan friend, who agreed the next morning to attend me to a printer of his ac|quaintance: we &s;oon, through his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, produced a lodging, and, for the &s;ake of literary convenience, it was in a &s;mall court, that led into Paterno&s;ter-row.</P>
<P>Upon going into the printer's &s;hop the ma&s;ter &s;urveyed me critically, and without any previous, or delicate ce|remony, a&s;ked (as &s;oon as he under|&s;tood
<PB N="181" REF="183">
my bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;) what I could <HI>do?</HI> whether I had any <HI>&s;pecimens</HI> about me? whether I was a <HI>ver&s;e-man,</HI> or a <HI>pro&s;e-man?</HI> whether I had ever dab|bled, in tho&s;e doings, or was only go|ing to throw my ink about the world?</P>
<P>My friend an&s;wered for me, that, I was a young man of genius who could turn my hand to any thing, that I would enter into immediate employ; and that my diligence might be de|pended on.</P>
<P>As author&s;hip was thus early the nece&s;&s;ary means of eating and drink|ing, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed I had much time to be&s;tow upon the elegancies of compo&s;ition; upon po|li&s;hing
<PB N="182" REF="184">
my periods, arranging my arguments, or decorating my &s;enti|ments: good, or good for nothing, &s;o many pages were to produce &s;o many pence, and therefore the main point was, to have the pen almo&s;t always in my hand, and &s;cribble away, for the <HI>&s;upplies of the day.</HI> Ge|nerally &s;peaking, however, my ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, the book&s;ellers, cut out my bu&s;ine&s;s, and told me <HI>what,</HI> and <HI>how much</HI> would be wanting that night.</P>
<P>If, as it is a&s;&s;erted, there be uni|ver&s;al charms in variety; never ought man to be more contented, or think him&s;elf more entertained than my&s;elf; for I have often wrote round the whole circle of the &s;ciences in twenty

four hours.&mdash;I purcha&s;ed my break|fa&s;t by a page of politics&mdash;my din|ner by a &s;heet of biography&mdash;my tea by hi&s;tory&mdash;my &s;upper by a poem on the plea&s;ures of the &s;pring, and my lodging (which I &s;hifted nearly as often as my &s;ubjects, and much oftner than my linen) by divinity. The next day came into play for the morning, a &s;lice of mathematics&mdash;for noon, a plate of tran&s;lation, and for the even|ing, a di&s;h of indexes. My employ|ers, &s;ir, notwith&s;tanding this labour of Hercules, made woeful complaints that my works did not &s;ell, that they did not pay for paper and print&mdash;that <HI>I was not known:</HI> that unle&s;s I could get a popular writer to lend me his

<P>About this time poor Lucia's wardrobe began to decline, though her lovely face was ever dre&s;&s;ed in &s;miles of congratulation, or in tears of &s;ympathy&mdash;my own apparel began to be truly literary, and I recollected to have often &s;een one of my book|&s;ellers, who&s;e name was Meadowes, &s;lide about his &s;hop in the mornings, till after hair dre&s;&s;ing time, in a green frock. We were both of a &s;ize, and I made formal propo&s;als&mdash;this very frock Sir co&s;t me a whole octavo vo|lume of &s;ermons, which were printed the following month&punc; under the tak|ing title of &s;ermons, by a late right

reverend prelate, warranted originals, and to be &s;een by the curious in his lord&s;hip's own hand writing. While I was labouring for the coat, I had no other wages till I had earned that, than what I could get by working after &s;tated hours: and yet it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me and my wife to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the interim: accord|ingly I &s;at up for two nights together, and wrote a large poem of the 1s. 6d. &s;ize, on conjugal tenderne&s;s, entitled the <HI>faithful pair.</HI> I hurried away with this the next morning to a new purcha&s;er, who &s;aid if I would leave it ten days or a fortnight, he would give me his an&s;wer. This propo&s;al, not &s;uiting the &s;ituation of affairs at home, I went to a &s;econd dealer in
<PB N="186" REF="188">
the&s;e wares, who having looked at the title &s;aid, he had made an oath never to burn his fingers again&s;t the blaze of <HI>poetry</HI> any more; a third ob&s;erved, that he would &s;ell me a parcel of poems by the pound&mdash;and a fourth hinted, that if I would take the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;ubject, and write in &s;upport of conjugal infidelity, he would treat with me.</P>
<P>Chagrined, wounded, de&s;olate, and di&s;gu&s;ted, I went into a pawnbroker's &s;hop, and pledged a pocket-piece of &s;ilver, upon which&mdash;the value being four &s;hillings&mdash;they lent me two and twenty pence; with this modicum I bought a few nece&s;&s;aries, and ran to offer them to the half-&s;tarved, but

<P>The next morning, an hour before the time of going to work, I thought &s;omething agreeable might happen from trying the heart of Mr. Mea|dows; and &s;etting my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly down to the ta&s;k, while Lucia was a&s;leep, I thus addre&s;&s;ed the feel|ings of a Book&s;eller.</P>

<P><PB N="196" REF="198">In the mid&s;t of this literary labour and indigence, a relation of Lucia's died, and bequeathed her the &s;um of two hundred pounds. This was a delicious windfall, and I received it in bank bills a month after the per|&s;ons decea&s;e: violent, and immediate tran&s;itions however, are unde&s;irable and dangerous: the leap, from po|verty to plenty is truly alarming, and many a man's head turns giddy in making it. Such was the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I had no &s;ooner got this pre|cious trea&s;ure in my hands, than I gave a loo&s;e to imagination. As it was Lucia's money, I could not bear the idea of u&s;ing it for <HI>my</HI> purpo&s;es. I con&s;idered the poor hut in which that excellent creature re&s;ided, as un|worthy

&s;uch an inhabitant, and there|fore, immediately, and unknown to her, I took two little neat apartments, and furni&s;hed them to&mdash;what I knew to be her ta&s;te&mdash;I reflected upon the forlorn &s;tate of her wardrobe, and I repaired it by &s;ilks, laces, linens, &amp;c. to the amount of almo&s;t one of the hundred pounds &mdash; with the&s;e pur|cha&s;es, which I made from time to time in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t week, I, at a proper period, made Lucia ac|quainted, and the dear creature Sir was almo&s;t ready to faint at the tid|ings. She &s;aw the conjugal delicacy and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my intentions, but &s;he &s;aw al&s;o the imprudence of laying out all our little property, in finery, that was wholly incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="198" REF="200">
with our embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate, and our future expectation. Luckily, how|ever, my furniture was &s;econd hand, and I had eighteen guineas &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: we therefore agreed to manage this with the utmo&s;t frugality, till I could &s;upply my&s;elf by writing &s;ome work, that, by tak|ing time and pains with it, might be likely to e&s;tabli&s;h my reputation as an author; after which, according to the trite expre&s;&s;ion, a man may lie a bed. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e oeconomi|cal re&s;olutions, I had fixed upon my &s;ubject, &s;ketched out the plan of my de&s;ign, entered upon the introduc|tory parts, and began to kindle in the progre&s;s; when, lo!

<PB N="199" REF="201">
certain demands which various trades-people had on their books again&s;t me, for former nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>One evening, after I had laid a&s;ide the pen, in order to enjoy the &s;weets of a conver&s;ation never tedious, and always tender; ju&s;t as Lucia began to entertain me with a favourite &s;ong, a man came into our apartment and pre&s;ented a bill for thirty-&s;even pounds, which had been owing him, and collecting to that &s;ize, for up|wards of two years. Startled as I was, I hardly knew, how to &s;tammer forth an apology, and the creditor perceiving my confu&s;ion took it as a token of my di&s;tre&s;s, and was <HI>therefore</HI> re&s;olved to have his money on the &s;pot. I equi|vocated.
<PB N="200" REF="202">
He left me abruptly, and, with the authority of a creditor, &s;lapt to my dining-room door with a &s;hew of indignation. Our &s;ong, and all our harmony, you may be &s;ure, was now broken, and we were left to many &s;orrowful reflections.</P>
<P>Our affection, however Sir, was of &s;o delicate a nature, that all the ar|dours of romance were realized in my conduct, and even pa&s;toral &s;enti|ments &s;carce did ju&s;tice, to the ten|derne&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

The names of Charles, Mr. Reynolds, and one or two more, were &s;everal times repeated: he cla&s;ped his hands together, and em|ployed his la&s;t breath in ble&s;&s;ing you
<PB N="240" REF="242">
all. After this he turned upon his pillow, and (though he exhibited the greate&s;t &s;igns of pain) remained &s;peechle&s;s till he expired.</P>
<P>I was with him all the time&mdash;I am not afraid of catching any bad &s;ick|ne&s;s in performing my duty to the be&s;t man, and the be&s;t ma&s;ter that ever lived&mdash;God Almighty knows be&s;t, in &s;uch ca&s;es what to <HI>do:</HI> but I am &s;ure he could not be plea&s;ed if I like the re&s;t of the &s;ervants, had ne|glected &s;o worthy a gentleman in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and I &s;hall ever honour you Sir, for the courage your friend&s;hip gave you to come and look at the good doctor, when other peo|ple run away from him. I have
<PB N="241" REF="243">
been nineteen years his &s;ervant, Sir, on and off, and he has many times &s;aved my life&mdash;I certainly &s;hall not now leave him, while he is upon the earth; and yet the phy&s;ician &s;ays he mu&s;t be put into the ground di|rectly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXXX. CHARLES</HI> to <HI>H. T. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>THE large packet of letters that I &s;end you, will at once apologize and account for my long &s;ilence. Neither, Charlotte, Mr. Rey|nolds, or your friend, have of late been able to take up the pen. It was this day month, that the body of our mo&s;t worthy benefactor was committed to the earth&mdash;I do mo&s;t truly a&s;&s;ure you, that the affluence in which his unequalled genero&s;ity has left me, by no means compen&s;ate
<PB N="243" REF="245">
the plea&s;ure I had in his &s;ociety, and the &s;atisfaction I received from his life.</P>
<P>He has divided the bulk of his fortunes among&s;t three per&s;ons, my Templeton, who certainly could form no po&s;&s;ible expectation of his bounty. Here follows a faithful extract from his will.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>Item,</HI> To my beloved friend Charles, I bequeath my dwel|ling-hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;treet, with all its furniture, plate, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to Charlotte, in te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for her vir|tue, and reverence for her misfor|tunes,
<PB N="244" REF="246">
the &s;um of two thou&s;and five hundred pounds, to be paid imme|diately on my decea&s;e, or as &s;oon afterwards as the &s;aid &s;um can be conveniently drawn from the funds, where lie certain monies mentioned in other parts of this my la&s;t te&s;ti|ment."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath, to my &s;ervant James Spedman one hundred pounds &s;terling."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> To Charles, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> I be|queath one thou&s;and pounds, for the u&s;e of Cleora, to be paid out of my ca&s;h, now lying, and being in the funds."</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247">"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to the &s;aid Charles, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> my Su&s;&s;ex e&s;tate, &s;ub|jected to the yearly rent of two hun-pounds, to be paid into the hands of J. Reynolds, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which is a debt due to the &s;aid J. Reynolds, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for many years."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> To the afore&s;aid J. Rey|nolds, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in con&s;ideration of in|tere&s;t on the &s;aid debt, my hou&s;es, lands, and properties, what&s;oever, and where&s;oever, lying and being in the i&s;land of Jamaica."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to Charlotte all my pictures in my library, with all my books, paintings, and the miniature of my dear wife Maria,
<PB N="246" REF="248">
hanging over the library chimney piece."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I charge the &s;aid Su&s;&s;ex e&s;tate, given to Charles, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with the annual deduction of one hundred pounds, to be paid to Charlotte during her natural life, on every eighteenth day of Augu&s;t, being the anniver&s;ary of that lady's birth."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath to H. Templeton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one hundred gui|neas for a mourning ring, and any other te&s;timonies of friend&s;hip that he may choo&s;e to employ it in."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath, to Charlotte, the watch, and &s;ome
<PB N="247" REF="249">
trinkets lying in a little gold box in my front parlour drawers, al&s;o my old and favourite dog Pompey, with an annuity of five pounds during his natural life, to be paid out of the Su&s;&s;ex e&s;tate, over and above the annuity of one hundred pounds."</P>
<P>Can any words, oh my dear Tem|pleton, be adequate to &s;uch circum|&s;tances&mdash;and yet there is not a &s;ingle per&s;on concerned who would not ra|ther enjoy the dear company of the te&s;tator, than the &s;plendid evidences of his tenderne&s;s and attention.</P>
<P>And then to die, as he did, in the meridian of life&mdash;in a &s;ituation &s;o pathetic, at a time &s;o delicately criti|cal!
<PB N="248" REF="250">
Ble&s;&s;ed, for ever ble&s;&s;ed be his memory upon earth &mdash; Rich and abundant be his rewards in Heaven. Never did I &s;ee &s;uch genuine, un|affected grief and gratitude that mix them&s;elves in the &s;ympathy of Char|lotte and Mr. Reynolds.&mdash;</P>
<P>Cleora's letter al&s;o upon the &s;ub|ject, does her honour.&mdash;</P>
<P>Reynolds and I, live at pre&s;ent in the good doctor's hou&s;e; and we are &s;o often reminded of his image, and his goodne&s;s, in every thing about us, that it is not in the power of gold to charm our grief&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251">That I have &s;till a &s;igh for Char|lotte, is but too certain, and I would mo&s;t willingly reject all that I am now worth, and, after all deductions, that will, I find, be a con&s;iderable fortune&mdash;Yes, Templeton, I would yield up every &s;hilling&mdash;be again in|volved &mdash;again a pri&s;oner &mdash; again liable to all the in&s;ults of an unfor|tunate man&mdash;and depend for the re|mainder of my days upon the pre|carious efforts of my own hands&mdash; had I this minute the privilege of of leading her by the hand to the foot of the altar&mdash;</P>
<P>I conjure you to come to town, and let us, in the fir&s;t place do ju&s;tice to
<PB N="250" REF="252">
our benefactor, by erecting to his memory a &s;uitable monument; and let us in&s;cribe on it &s;uch &s;entiments, as expre&s;s our grief and our grati|tude in the mo&s;t lively manner.</P>
