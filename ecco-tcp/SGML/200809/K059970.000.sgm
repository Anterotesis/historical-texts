<HEAD>EVERY-BODY'S Bu&s;ine&s;s, IS NO-BODY'S Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS is a Proverb &s;o common in Every-body's Mouth, that I wonder No-body has yet thought it worth while to draw proper In|ferences from it, and expo&s;e tho&s;e little Abu&s;es, which, tho' they &s;eem trifling, and as it were &s;carce worth Con&s;idera|tion, yet by In&s;en&s;ible Degrees, they may become of injurious Con&s;equence to the Pub|lick; like &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e fir&s;t Symptoms are only trifling Di&s;orders, yet by Continu|ance and Progre&s;&s;ion, their la&s;t Periods ter|minate in the De&s;truction of the whole Hu|mane Fabrick.</P>
<P>In Contradiction therefore to this general Rule, and out of &s;incere Love and Well-meaning to the Publick, give me leave to enumerate
<PB N="4" REF="4">
the Abu&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly crept in among us, and the Inconveniences daily ari&s;ing from the In|&s;olence and Intrigues of our Servant Wenches, who, by their caballing together, have made their Party &s;o con&s;iderable, that Every-body cries out again&s;t 'em; and yet, to verify the Proverb, No-body has thought of, or at lea&s;t propo&s;ed a Remedy, altho' &s;uch an Under|taking (mean as it &s;eems to be) I hope will one Day be thought worthy the Con&s;idera|tion of our King, Lords, and Commons.</P>
<P>Women Servants are now &s;o &s;carce, that from 30 and 40 Shillings a Year, their Wa|ges are increa&s;ed of late to 6, 7, and 8 Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and upwards; in&s;omuch, that an ordinary Trade&s;man cannot well keep one; but his Wife, who might be u&s;eful in his Shop, or Bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t do the Drudgery of Hou&s;hold Affairs: and all this, becau&s;e our Servant Wenches are &s;o puff'd up with Pride, now a Days, that they never think they go fine enough: It is a hard Matter to know the Mi&s;tre&s;s from the Maid by their Dre&s;s, nay very often the Maid &s;hall be much the finer of the two. Our Woollen Manufacture &s;uffers much by this, for now, nothing but Silks and Sattins will go down with our Kitchen Wenches, and it is to &s;upport this intollerable Pride, that they have in&s;en&s;ibly rai&s;ed their Wages to &s;uch a Heighth, as was never known in any Age or Nation but this.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
Let us trace this from the beginning, and &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on has a Servant Maid &s;ent him out of the Country at 50 Shillings, or 3 Pounds a Year. The Girl has &s;carce been a Week, nay, a Day in her Service, but a Committee of Servant Wenches are appoint|ed to examine her, who advi&s;e her to rai&s;e her Wages, or give warning; to encourage her to which, the Herb-Woman or Chandler-Woman, or &s;ome other old Intelligencer, pro|vides her a Place of 4 or 5 Pounds a Year; this &s;ets Madam cock-a-hoop, and &s;he thinks of nothing now but Vails and high Wages, and &s;o gives warning from Place to Place, 'till &s;he has got her Wages up to the tip-top.</P>
<P>Her Neat's Leathern Shoes are now transform'd into lac'd Shoes with high Heels; her Yarn Stockings are turn'd into fine Wor&s;ted ones, with &s;ilk Clocks; and her high Wooden Pat|tens are kickt away for Leathern Clogs; &s;he mu&s;t have a Hoop too, as well as her Mi&s;tre&s;s; and her poor &s;canty Lin&s;ey-Wool&s;ey Petticoat is changed into a good Silk one, 4 or 5 Yards wide at the lea&s;t: Not to carry the De&s;crip|tion farther, in &s;hort, plain Country-<HI>Joan</HI> is now turn'd into a fine <HI>London</HI>-Madam, can drink Tea, take Snuff, and carry her &s;elf as high as the be&s;t.</P>
<P>If &s;he is tollerably hand&s;ome, and has any &s;hare of Cunning, the Apprentice or her Ma&s;ter's Son is entic'd away and ruin'd
<PB N="6" REF="6">
by her. Thus many good Families are impove|ri&s;hed and di&s;grac'd by the&s;e Pert Sluts, who, taking the Advantage of a Young Man's Sim|plicity and unruly De&s;ires, draw many heed|le&s;s Youths, nay, &s;ome of good E&s;tates into their Snares; and of this we have but too many In&s;tances.</P>
<P>Some more artful &s;hall conceal their Condition, and palm them&s;elves on Young Fellows for Gentlewomen, and great For|tunes; How many Families have been ruin'd by the&s;e Ladies? When the Father or Ma&s;ter of the Family, preferring the flirt|ing Airs of a young wanton prinkt up Strum|pet, to the artle&s;s &s;incerity of a plain, grave, and good Wife, has given his De&s;ires a-loo&s;e, and de&s;troy'd Soul, Body, Family and E&s;tate. But they are very favourable if they wheedle No-body into Matrimony, but only make a Pre|&s;ent of a &s;mall live Creature, no bigger than a Ba&s;tard to &s;ome of the Family, no matter who gets it; when a Child is born it mu&s;t be kept.</P>
<P>Our Se&s;&s;ions Papers of late are crowded with In&s;tances of Servant Maids robbing their Places, this can be only attributed to their devili&s;h Pride; for their whole Enquiry now a Days, is how little they &s;hall do, how much they &s;hall have.</P>
<P>But all this while they make &s;o little re|&s;erve, that if they fall &s;ick the Pari&s;h mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="7">
keep 'em, if they are out of Place, they mu&s;t pro&s;titute their Bodies, or &s;tarve, &s;o that from chopping and changing, they generally pro|ceed to whoring and thieving, and this is the Rea&s;on why our Streets &s;warm with Strum|pets.</P>
<P>Thus many of 'em rove from Place to Place, from Bawdy-Hou&s;e to Service, and from Ser|vice to Bawdy-Hou&s;e again, ever un&s;ettled, and never ea&s;y, nothing being more common than to find the&s;e Creatures one Week in a good Family, and the next in a Brothel: This Amphibious Life makes 'em fit for nei|ther, for if the Bawd u&s;es them ill, away they trip to Service, and if their Mi&s;tre&s;s gives 'em a wry Word, whip they're at a Bawdy-Hou&s;e again, &s;o that in Effect they neither make good Whores or good Ser|vants.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not thus &s;lippery in the Tail, are light of Finger, and of the&s;e the mo&s;t pernicious, are tho&s;e who beggar you Inch-meal. If a Maid is a downright Thief, &s;he &s;trips you at once, and you know your Lo&s;s; but your retail Pilferers wa&s;te you in&s;en&s;ibly, and tho' you hardly mi&s;s it, yet your Sub&s;tance &s;hall decay to &s;uch a de|gree, that you mu&s;t have a very good Bottom indeed, not to feel the ill Effects of &s;uch Moths in your Family.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
Tea, Sugar, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or any &s;uch trifling Commodities are reckoned no Thefts, if they do not directly take your Pewter from your Shelf, or your Linnen from your Draw|ers, they are very Hone&s;t: What harm is there, &s;ay they, in cribbing a little Matter for a Junket, or a merry Bout or &s;o? Nay, there are tho&s;e that when they are &s;ent to Market for one Joint of Meat, &s;hall take up two on their Ma&s;ter's Account, and leave one by the Way, for &s;ome of the&s;e Maids are very cha|ritable, and can make a &s;hift to maintain a &s;mall Family with what they can Purloin from their Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If you &s;end 'em with ready Money they turn Factors, and take 3<HI>d.</HI> or 4<HI>d.</HI> in the Shil|ling Brokeridge. And here let me take Notice of one very heinous Abu&s;e, not to &s;ay petty Felony, which is practiced in mo&s;t of the great Families about Town, and that is, when the Trade&s;men gives the Hou&s;e-keeper, or other commanding Servant, a Penny or two Pence in the Shilling, or &s;o much in the Pound, for every Thing they &s;end in, which from thence is called Poundage.</P>
<P>This, in my Opinion, is the greate&s;t of Villanies, and ought to incur &s;ome Puni&s;h|ment, yet nothing is more common, and our topping Trade&s;men, who &s;eem otherwi&s;e to &s;tand mightily on their Credit, make this but a Matter of Cour&s;e and Cu&s;tom.
<PB N="9" REF="9">
If I don't, &s;ays one, another will, (for the Servant is &s;ure to pick a Hole in the Per|&s;ons Coat, who &s;hall not pay Contribu|tion:) Thus this wicked Practice is carried on and wink'd at, while receiving of &s;tolen Goods, and confederating with Felons, which is not a jot wor&s;e, is &s;o openly cry'd out again&s;t, and &s;o &s;everely puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>And yet if a Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s enquire after any Thing mi&s;&s;ing, they mu&s;t be &s;ure to place their Words in due Form, or Madam huffs and flings about at a &s;trange Rate, What would you make a Thief of her? Who would live with &s;uch mi&s;tru&s;t|ful Folks? Thus you are obliged to hold your Tongue, and &s;it down quietly by your lo&s;s, for fear of offending your Maid, for|&s;ooth.</P>
<P>Again, if your Maid &s;hall maintain one, two, or more Per&s;ons from your Table, whe|ther they are her poor Relations, Coun|try Folk, or Servants out of Place, or whe|ther they are Shoe-cleaners, Chare-women, Porters, or any other of her menial Servants who do her Lady&s;hips Drudgery, and go of her Errands, you mu&s;t not grumble or complain at your Expence, or ask, What is become of &s;uch a Thing, or &s;uch a Thing? altho' it might never &s;o rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that it was altogether impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;o much expen|ded in your Family; but hold your Tongue
<PB N="10" REF="10">
for Peace &s;ake, or Madam will &s;ay, You grudge her Victuals, and expo&s;e you to the la&s;t De|gree all over the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Thus have they a Salve for every Sore, cheat you to your Face, and in&s;ult you into the Bar|gain; nor can you help your &s;elf without ex|po&s;ing your&s;elf, or putting your&s;elf into a Pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another great Abu&s;e crept in among us, is the giving of Vails, to Servants; this was intended originally as an Incouragement to willing and handy Servants, but by Cu&s;tom and Corruption it is now grown to be a Thorn in our Sides, and, like other good Things, abu&s;ed, does more hurt than good; for now they make it a Perqui&s;ite, a material Part of their Wages; nor mu&s;t their Ma&s;ter give a Supper, but the Maid expects the Gue&s;ts &s;hould pay for it, nay, &s;ometimes through the No&s;e. Thus have they &s;pirited People up to this unnece&s;&s;ary and burthen&s;ome Piece of Genero&s;ity, unknown to our Fore-Fathers, who only gave Gifts to Servants at <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s</HI>-tide, which Cu&s;tom is yet kept up into the Bargain, in&s;omuch, that a Maid &s;hall have 8 Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> in a Gentleman's or Merchant's Family: And if her Ma&s;ter is a Man of a free Spirit, and receives much Company, &s;he very often doubles her Wages by her Vails; thus having Meat, Drink, Wa&s;hing, and Lodging for her La|bour,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;he throws her whole Income upon her Back, and by this Means looks more like the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family, than the Servant-Wench.</P>
<P>And now we have mention'd wa&s;hing, I would ask &s;ome good Hou&s;e-wifely Gentlewo|men, If Servant-Maids wearing printed Lin|nens, Cottons, and other Things of that Na|ture, which require frequent wa&s;hing, do not, by enhauncing the Article of Soap, add more to Hou&s;e-keeping, than the Generality of People would imagine? And yet the&s;e Wenches cry out again&s;t great Wa&s;hes, when their own unnece&s;&s;ary Dabs are very often the Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Abu&s;e of all, is, that the&s;e Creatures are become their own Law|givers; nay, I think they are ours too, tho' No-body would imagine that &s;uch a Set of Slatterns &s;hould bamboozle a whole Nation: But it is neither better or wor&s;e, they hire them&s;elves to you by their own Rule.</P>
<P>That is, a Month's Wages, or a Month's Warning; if they don't like you they will go away the next Day, help your&s;elf how you can; if you don't like them, you mu&s;t give them a Month's Wages to get rid of them.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom of Warning, as practis'd by our Maid-Servants, is now become a great Inconvenience to Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. You
<PB N="12" REF="12">
mu&s;t carry your Di&s;h very upright, or Mi&s;s, for&s;ooth, gives you Warning, and you are either left de&s;titute, or to &s;eek for a Servant: So that generally &s;peaking, you are &s;eldom or never fix'd, but always at the Mercy of every new Servant to divulge your Fami|ly-Affairs, to in&s;pect your private Life, and trea&s;ure up the Sayings of your&s;elf and Friends. A very great Confinement, and much complain'd of in mo&s;t Families.</P>
<P>Thus have the&s;e Wenches, by their con|tinual Plotting and Cabals, united them&s;elves into a formidable Body, and got the Whip-Hand of their Betters; they make their own Terms with us; and two Servants now, will &s;carce undertake the Work which one might perform with Ea&s;e, yet notwith&s;tanding they have rais'd their Wages to a mo&s;t exorbitant Pitch; and, I doubt not, if there be not a Stop put to their Career, but they will bring Wages up to twenty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> in time, for they are much about half Way already.</P>
<P>'Tis by the&s;e Means they run away with a great Part of our Money, which might be better employ'd in Trade; and what is wor&s;e, by their in&s;olent Behaviour, their Pride in Dre&s;s, and their exorbitant Wages, they give Birth to the following Inconveniences.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They &s;et an ill Example to our Chil|dren, our Apprentices, our Covenant-Servants, and other Dependants, by their &s;aucy and
<PB N="13" REF="13">
in&s;olent Behaviour, their pert, and &s;ometimes abu&s;ive, An&s;wers, their daring Defiance of Correction, and many other In&s;olencies which Youth are but too apt to imitate.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> By their Extravagance in Dre&s;s, they put our Wives and Daughters upon yet greater Exce&s;&s;es, becau&s;e they will (as indeed they ought) go finer than the Maid: Thus the Maid &s;triving to out-do the Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Trade&s;man's Wife to out-do the Gentleman's Wife, the Gentleman's Wife emulating the Lady, and the Ladies one another, it &s;eems as if the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the female Sex, were nothing, but Exce&s;s of Pride, and Extra|vagance in Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> The great Height to which Women-Servants have brought their Wages, makes a Mutiny among the Men-Servants, and puts them upon rai&s;ing their Wages too: So that in a little Time our Servants will become our Partners, nay, probably, run away with the better Part of our Profits, and &s;o make Ser|vants of us <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> And, yet with all the&s;e Inconveniences, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly do without the&s;e Creatures, let us therefore, cea&s;e to talk of the Abu&s;es ari&s;ing from 'em, and begin to think of redre&s;&s;ing 'em. I do not &s;et up for a Law-giver, &s;o &s;hall lay down no certain Rules, humbly &s;ubmitting in all things, to the Wi&s;dom of our Legi&s;lature. Therefore what I offer &s;hall be under Cor|rection,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and upon Conjecture, my utmo&s;t Am|bition being but to give &s;ome Hint to remedy this growing Evil, and leave the Pro&s;ecution to abler Heads.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle and limit their Wages, from forty and fifty Shillings to four and five Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> that is to &s;ay, according to their Merits and Capa|cities: For Example, a young unexperienc'd Servant to have 40<HI>s. per Annum</HI> 'till &s;he qualifies her&s;elf for a larger Sum; a Servant who can do all Hou&s;hold-Work, or, as the good Women term it, can take her Work and leave her Work, &s;hould have four Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> and tho&s;e who have liv'd &s;even Years in one Service, &s;hould ever after demand five Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> for I would very fain have &s;ome particular Encouragements and Privileges given to &s;uch Servants, who &s;hould continue long in a Place; it would incite a De&s;ire to plea&s;e, and cau&s;e an Emulation very beneficial to the Publick.</P>
<P>I have heard of an ancient Charity in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Clement's-Danes,</HI> where a Sum of Money, or E&s;tate, is left, out of the Intere&s;t or Income of which, &s;uch Maid-Servants, who have liv'd in that Pari&s;h &s;even Years in one Service, if they plea&s;e to demand it, receive a Reward of ten Pounds a Piece.</P>
<P>This is a noble Benefaction, and &s;hews the publick Spirit of the Donor; but Every-body's
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Bu&s;ine&s;s is No-body's, for I have not heard that &s;uch Reward has been paid to any Ser|vant of late Years; a thou&s;and pities that a Gift of that Nature &s;hould &s;ink in Oblivion, and not be kept up as an Example to in|cite all Pari&s;hes to do the like.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> had a Law, call'd <HI>Jus Trium Liberorum,</HI> by which every Man who had been Father of three Children had particular Honours and Privileges: This incited the Youth to quit a di&s;&s;olute &s;ingle Life, and be|come Fathers of Families, to the Support and Glory of the Empire.</P>
<P>In Imitation of this mo&s;t excellent Law, I would have &s;uch Servants, who &s;hould continue many Years in one Service, meet with &s;ingular E&s;teem and Reward.</P>
<P>The Apparel of our Women-Servants &s;hould be next regulated, that we may know the Mi&s;tre&s;s from the Maid. I remember I was once put very much to the Blu&s;h, being at a Friend's Hou&s;e, and by him requir'd to &s;alute the Ladies, I ki&s;s'd the Chamber-Jade in to the bargain, for &s;he was as well dre&s;s'd as the be&s;t. But I was &s;oon undeceiv'd by a general Titter, that gave me the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, nor can I believe my&s;elf the only Per&s;on who has made &s;uch a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Things of this Nature would be avoided, if our Servant-Maids were to wear Liveries, as our Footmen do; or if they were oblig'd to
<PB N="16" REF="16">
go in a Dre&s;s &s;uitable to their Station. What &s;hould ail them, but a Jacket and Petticoat of good Yard-wide Stuff, or Callimanco might keep 'em decent and Warm.</P>
<P>Our Charity Children are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Dre&s;s, why then may not our Women Servants? Why may they not be made frugal <HI>per</HI> force, and not put all on their Backs, but &s;ave &s;omething again&s;t a rainy Day? I am there|fore entirely again&s;t any Servants wearing of Silks, Laces, and other &s;uperfluous Finery; it &s;ets them above them&s;elves, and makes their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es contemptible in their Eyes. I am hand&s;omer than my Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;ays a young prink'd up Baggage, what pity 'tis I &s;hould be her Servant; I go as well dre&s;s'd or better than &s;he. This makes the Girl take the fir&s;t Offer to be made a Whore, and there is a good Servant &s;poil'd; whereas were her Dre&s;s but &s;uitable to her Condition, it would teach her Humility, and put her in Mind of her Duty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the fear of &s;poiling their Cloaths makes them afraid of Hou&s;hold-Work; &s;o that in a little Time we &s;hall have none but Chamber-maids, and Nur&s;ery-Maids; and of this let me give one In&s;tance: My Family is compo&s;ed of my &s;elf and Si&s;ter, a Man and a Maid; and being without a Servant, a young Wench came to hire her &s;elf as a Servant; the Man was gone out, and my Si&s;ter above
<PB N="17" REF="17">
Stairs, &s;o I open'd the Door my &s;elf, and this Per&s;on pre&s;ented her&s;elf to my View, dre&s;s'd compleatly, and more like a Vi&s;itor than a Servant-Maid; &s;he, not knowing me, ask'd for my Si&s;ter: Pray Madam, &s;aid I, be pleas'd to walk into the Parlour, and &s;he &s;hall wait on you pre&s;ently. Accordingly, I handed Madam in, who took it very cordially. After &s;ome Apology, I left her alone for a Minute or two, while I (&s;tupid Wretch!) runs up to my Si&s;ter, and told her there was a Gentlewoman below come to vi&s;it her. Dear Brother, &s;aid &s;he, don't leave her alone, go down and entertain her while I dre&s;s my &s;elf. Accordingly, down I went, and talk'd of indifferent Affairs with Madam; mean while my Si&s;ter dre&s;s'd her&s;elf all over again, not being willing to be &s;een in an Undre&s;s. At la&s;t &s;he came down dre&s;s'd as clean as her Vi&s;itor: but how great was my Surprize, when I found my fine Lady a common Ser|vant-Wench.</P>
<P>My Si&s;ter, under&s;tanding what &s;he was, began to ask what Wages &s;he expected? She mode&s;tly asked but eight Pounds a Year. The next Que&s;tion was, what Work &s;he could do to de&s;erve &s;uch Wages? To this &s;he an&s;wer'd, That &s;he could clean a Hou&s;e, or dre&s;s a common Family-Dinner. But cannot you wa&s;h, reply'd my Si&s;ter, or get up Linnen? She an&s;wer'd in the Negative,
<PB N="18" REF="18">
and &s;aid, She would undertake neither, nor would &s;he go into any Family that did not put out their Linnen to wa&s;h, and hire a Chare-wo|man to &s;cour. She de&s;ir'd to &s;ee the Hou&s;e, and after having carefully &s;urvey'd it, &s;aid, The Work was too hard for her, nor could &s;he undertake it. This put my Si&s;ter beyond all Patience, and me into the greate&s;t Admiration. Young Wo|man, &s;aid &s;he, you have made a Mi&s;take, I want a Hou&s;e-Maid, and you are a Chamber-Maid. No Madam, reply'd &s;he, I am not Needle-Woman enough for that. And yet you ask 8 Pounds a Year reply'd my Si&s;ter. Yes Madam, &s;aid &s;he, nor &s;hall I bate a Far|thing. Then get you gone for a lazy impudent Baggage, &s;aid I; you want to be a Boarder, and not a Servant: Have you a Fortune, or E&s;tate, that you dre&s;s at that Rate? No Sir, &s;aid &s;he, but I hope I may wear what I work for without Offence. What you work for, In|terrupted my Si&s;ter, why you don't &s;eem wil|ling to undertake any: You will not wa&s;h or &s;cour; you cannot dre&s;s a Dinner for Com|pany; you are no Needle-Woman, and our little Hou&s;e, of two Rooms on a Floor, is too much for you. For God's &s;ake what can you do? Madam, reply'd &s;he pertly; I know my Bu&s;ine&s;s; and don't fear a Service; there are more Places than Pari&s;h Churches; if you wa&s;h at Home, you &s;hould have a Laundry-Maid;
<PB N="19" REF="19">
if you give Entertainments, you mu&s;t have a Cook-Maid; if you have any Needle-Work, you &s;hould have a Chamber-Maid; and &s;uch a Hou&s;e as this is enough for a Hou&s;e-Maid in all Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I was pleas'd at the Wit, and a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Impudence of the Girl, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd her with Thanks for her In&s;tructions; a&s;&s;uring her, that when I kept four Maids &s;he &s;hould be Hou&s;e-Maid, if &s;he pleas'd. Were a Ser|vant to do my Bu&s;ine&s;s with chearfulne&s;s, I &s;hould not grudge at five or &s;ix Pounds <HI>per Annum:</HI> Nor would I be &s;o unchri&s;tian as to put more upon any one, than they can bear; but to pray, and pay too, is the Devil; and it is very hard, that I mu&s;t keep four Ser|vants or none.</P>
<P>In great Families indeed, where many Servants are requir'd, the&s;e Di&s;tinctions of Chamber-Maid, Hou&s;e-Maid, Cook-Maid, Laundry-Maid, Nur&s;ery-Maid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are re|qui&s;ite, to the End, that each may take her particular Bu&s;ine&s;s, and many Hands may make the Work light: But for a private Gentleman, of a &s;mall Fortune, to be oblig'd to keep &s;o many Idle Jades, when one might do the Bu&s;ine&s;s, is intollerable, and matter of great Grievance.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e without a gentle Admonition and Reproof to &s;ome of my own Sex, I mean tho&s;e Gentlemen who
<PB N="20" REF="20">
give them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;ary Airs, and cannot go to &s;ee a Friend, but they mu&s;t ki&s;s and &s;lop the Maid; and all this is done with an Air of Gallantry, for&s;ooth, and mu&s;t not be re&s;ented: Nay, &s;ome Gentlemen are &s;o &s;illy, that they &s;hall carry on an under|hand Affair, with their Friend's Servant-Maid, to their own Di&s;grace, and the Ruin of many a young Creature. Nothing is more ba&s;e and ungenerous, yet nothing more common; and withal &s;o little taken Notice of. <HI>D&mdash; me, Jack,</HI> &s;ays one Friend to another, <HI>this Maid of yours is a pretty Girl, you do &s;o and &s;o to her by G&mdash;d.</HI> This makes the Servant-Maid Pert, Vain and Impudent, and &s;poils many a good Servant.</P>
<P>What Gentleman will de&s;cend to this low Way of Intrigue, when he &s;hall con&s;ider, that he has a Foot-Boy or an Apprentice for his Rival; and that he is &s;eldom or never ad|mitted, but when they have been his Ta&s;ters: And the Fool of Fortune, tho' he comes at the latter End of the Fea&s;t, yet pays the whole Reckoning; and &s;o indeed would I have all &s;uch &s;illy Cullies &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If I mu&s;t have an Intrigue, let it be with a Woman that &s;hall not &s;hame me. I would never go into the Kitchen, when the Parlour-Door was open. We are forbidden at <HI>High|gate,</HI> to ki&s;s the Maid when we may ki&s;s the Mi&s;tre&s;s: Why then will Gentlemen de&s;cend
<PB N="21" REF="21">
&s;o low, by too much familiarity with the&s;e Creatures, to bring them&s;elves into Con|tempt.</P>
<P>I have been at Places, where the Maid has been &s;o dizzied with the&s;e idle Compliments, that &s;he has mi&s;took one Thing for another, and not regarded her Mi&s;tre&s;s in the lea&s;t; but put on all the flirting Airs imaginable. But this Behaviour is no where &s;o much com|plain'd of as in Taverns, Coffee-Hou&s;es, and Places of publick Re&s;ort, where there are hand&s;ome Bar-Keepers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Creatures being puff'd up with the ful&s;ome flattery of a &s;et of Fle&s;h-Flies, that are continually buzzing about 'em, carry them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t In&s;olence imaginable; in&s;omuch, that you mu&s;t &s;peak to them with a great deal of Deference, or you are &s;ure to be affronted. I was at a Coffee-Hou&s;e t'other Day, where one of the&s;e Ladies kept the Bar, and had be&s;poke a Di&s;h of Rice-Tea; but Madam was &s;o taken up with her Sparks, that &s;he had quite forgot it. I &s;poke for it again, and with &s;ome Temper, but was an&s;wer'd after a mo&s;t taunting Manner, not without a to&s;s of the Head, a Contraction of the No&s;trils, and other Impertinencies, too many to enumerate. Seeing my &s;elf thus publickly in&s;ulted by &s;uch an Animal, I could not chu&s;e but &s;hew my Re&s;entment: Woman, &s;aid I, &s;ternly, I want a Di&s;h of Rice-Tea, and not what your
<PB N="22" REF="22">
Vanity and Impudence may imagine; therefore treat me as a Gentleman and a Cu&s;tomer, and &s;erve me with what I call for, and keep your impertinent Repartees and impudent Behaviour for the Coxcombs, that &s;warm round your Bar, and make you &s;o vain of your blown Carca&s;s. And indeed I believe the In&s;olence of this Creature will ruin her Ma&s;ter at la&s;t, by driving away Men of Sobriety and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and making the Place a Den of Vagabonds and Rake-Hells.</P>
<P>Gentlemen therefore ought to be very cir|cum&s;pect in their Behaviour, and not under|value them&s;elves to Servant-Wenches, who are but too apt to treat a Gentleman Ill, when ever he puts him&s;elf into their Pow|er.</P>
<P>Let me now beg pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion, and return to my Subject, by propo&s;ing &s;ome practicable Methods for regulating of Servants, which whether they are followed or not, yet if they afford Matter of Improvement and Speculation, it will an&s;wer the Heighth of my Expectation; and I will be the fir&s;t who &s;hall approve of whatever Improvements are made from this &s;mall Beginning.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Abu&s;e I would have reform'd, is, that Servants &s;hould be re&s;train'd from throw|ing them&s;elves out of Place on every idle Va|gary: This might be remedied were all Con|tracts between Ma&s;ter and Servant to be
<PB N="23" REF="23">
made before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, or other proper Officer, and a Memorandum thereof taken in Writing: Nor &s;hould &s;uch Servant leave his or her Place (for Men and Maids might come under the &s;ame Regulation) 'till the Time agreed on be expir'd, unle&s;s &s;uch Servant be mi&s;us'd or deny'd Nece&s;&s;aries, or &s;how &s;ome other rea&s;onable Cau&s;e for their Di&s;charge. In that Ca&s;e, the Ma&s;ter or Mi|&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be reprimanded, or fin'd: But if Servants misbehave them&s;elves, or leave their Places, not being regularly di&s;charg'd, they ought to be amerc'd or puni&s;h'd. But all tho&s;e idle ridiculous Cu&s;toms and Laws of their own making, &s;uch as, a Month's Wa|ges or a Month's Warning, and &s;uch like, &s;hould be intirely &s;et a&s;ide and aboli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>When a Servant has &s;erv'd the limited Time duly and faithfully, they &s;hould be intitul'd to a Certificate, as is practiced at pre&s;ent in the Wool-Combing Trade: Nor &s;hould any Per&s;on hire a Servant without a Certificate, or other proper Security. A Servant without a Certificate &s;hould be deem'd a Vagrant: And a Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s ought to a&s;&s;ign very good Rea&s;ons, when they object again&s;t giving a Servant his or her Certificate.</P>
<P>And tho' to avoid Prolixity, I have not mention'd Footmen particularly in the fore|going Di&s;cour&s;e: Yet the Complaints alledg'd again&s;t the Maids are as well Ma&s;culine as
<PB N="24" REF="24">
Feminine, and very applicable to our Gentle|men's Gentlemen. I would therefore have them under the very &s;ame Regulations; and as they are Fellow Servants, would not make Fi&s;h of one and Fle&s;h of the other, &s;ince daily Ex|perience teaches us, that
<Q>Never a Barrel the Better Herring.</Q></P>
<P>The next great Abu&s;e among us is, that under the Notion of cleaning our Shoes, above Ten Thou&s;and Wicked, Idle, Pilfering Va|grants, are permitted to patrol about our City and Suburbs. The&s;e are call'd the <HI>Black-Guard,</HI> who Black your Honour's Shoes, and incorporate them&s;elves under the Title of the <HI>Wor&s;hipful Company of Jappanners.</HI></P>
<P>Were this all, there were no hurt in it, and the whole might terminate in a Je&s;t: But the mi&s;chief Ends not here, they corrupt our Youth, e&s;pecially our Men-Servants; Oaths and Impudence are their only Flowers of Rheto|rick; Gaming and Thieving are the principal Parts of their Profe&s;&s;ion; but japanning, the Pre|tence. For Example, a Gentleman keeps a Servant, who, among other Things, is to clean his Ma&s;ters Shoes; but our Gentlemen's Servants are above it now a-Days, and your Man's Man performs the Office; for which
<PB N="25" REF="25">
piece of Service you pay double and treble, e&s;pecially if you keep a Table: For you are well off if the Jappanner has no more than his own Diet from your Table.</P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erv'd the&s;e Ra&s;cals &s;neak|ing from Gentlemen's Doors with Wallets, or Hats, full of good Victuals, which they either carry to their Trulls, or &s;ell for a Trifle. By this Means our Butcher's, our Baker's, our Poulterer's and Chee&s;emonger's Bills are mon&s;trou&s;ly exaggerated: Not to mention Candles ju&s;t lighted, which &s;ell for five Pence a Pound; many other Perqui&s;ites be&s;t known to them&s;elves and the pilfering Villains their Confederates.</P>
<P>Add to this, that their continual Gaming &s;ets Servants upon their Wits to &s;upply this Extravagance, tho', at the &s;ame Time the Ma&s;ter's Pocket pays for it; and the Time, which &s;hould be &s;pent in a Gentleman's Ser|vice, is loiter'd away among the&s;e Rake|hells: In&s;omuch, that half our Me&s;&s;ages are inefectual, the Time intended being often ex|pir'd before the Me&s;&s;age is deliver'd.</P>
<P>How many and frequent Robberies are committed by the&s;e Jappanners? And to how many more are they Confederates? Sil|ver-Spoons, Spurs, and other &s;mall Pieces of Plate, are every Day mi&s;&s;ing, and very often &s;ound upon the&s;e &s;ort of Gentlemen. Yet are they permitted, to the &s;hame of all our good
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Laws, and the Scandal of our mo&s;t excellent Government, to lurk about our Streets, to de|bauch our Servants and Apprentices, to &s;up|port an infinite Number of &s;candalous, &s;hame|le&s;s Trulls, yet more wicked then them|&s;elves: For not a jack among 'em, but mu&s;t have his Gill.</P>
<P>By whom &s;uch Indecencies are daily acted even in our open Streets, as are very offen&s;ive to the Eyes and Ears of all &s;ober Per&s;ons, and even abominable in a Chri&s;tian Country.</P>
<P>In any Riot or other Di&s;turbance, the&s;e Sparks are always the foremo&s;t; for mo&s;t among 'em can turn their Hands to picking of Pockets; to run away with Goods from a Fire, or other publick Confu&s;ion; to &s;natch any Thing from a Woman, or Child; to &s;trip a Hou&s;e when the Door is open; or any other Branch of a Thief's Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is a Nur&s;ery for Thieves and Villains; mode&s;t Women are every Day in|&s;ulted by them and their Strumpets; and &s;uch Children as run about the Streets, or &s;uch Servants as go on Errands, do but too fre|quently bring home &s;ome Scraps of their bea&s;tly, profane Wit; in&s;omuch, that the Conver&s;ation of our lower Rank of People runs only upon Bawdy and Bla&s;phemy, not|with&s;tanding our Societies for Reformation, and our Laws in force again&s;t Profane&s;s: For this lazy Life gets them many Pro&s;elites, their
<PB N="27" REF="27">
Numbers daily increa&s;ing by run-away Ap|prentices and Foot-Boys; in&s;omuch that it is a very hard Matter for a Gentleman to get him a Servant, or for a Trade&s;man to find an Apprentice.</P>
<P>Innumerable other Mi&s;chiefs accrue, and others will &s;pring up, from this Race of Cat|terpillars, who mu&s;t be &s;wept from out our Streets, or we &s;hall be over-run with all man|ner of Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the Subject is &s;o low, that it becomes di&s;agreeable even to my &s;elf, give me leave therefore to propo&s;e a Way to clear the Streets of the&s;e Vermin, and to &s;ub&s;titute as many hone&s;t indu&s;trious Per&s;ons in their &s;tead, who are now &s;tarving for want of Bread, while the&s;e execrable Villains live (though in Rags and Na&s;tine&s;s, yet) in Plenty and Luxury.</P>
<P>I therefore humbly propo&s;e, that the&s;e Vagabonds be put immediately under the Command and In&s;pection of &s;uch Task-Ma|&s;ters as the Government &s;hall appoint, and that they be employ'd, puni&s;h'd and re|warded, according to their Capacities and Demerits; that is to &s;ay, the indu&s;trious and docible to Wool-combing and other Parts of the Woollen Manufacture, where Hands are wanted; as al&s;o to Husbandry and other Parts of Agriculture.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
For it is evident, that there are &s;carce Hands enow in the Country to carry on either of the&s;e Affairs. Now the&s;e Vaga|bonds might not only by this Means be kept out of Harm's Way, but be render'd &s;er|viceable to the Nation. Nor is there any need of tran&s;porting 'em beyond Seas, for if any are refractory, they &s;hould be &s;ent to our Stannaries and other Mines, to our Coal-Works and other Places, where hard Labour is requir'd. And here I mu&s;t offer one Thing, never yet thought of, or propo&s;ed by any, and that is, the keeping in due Re|pair the Navigation of the River-<HI>Thames,</HI> &s;o u&s;eful to our Trade in general: And yet of late Years &s;uch va&s;t Hills of Sand are gathered together in &s;everal Parts of the River, as are very prejudicial to its Na|vigation. One of which is near <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> another near <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and an|other near <HI>Batter&s;ea.</HI> The&s;e two la&s;t in particular are of very great Hindrance to the Navigation. And indeed the Removal of them ought to be a National Concern, which I humbly propo&s;e may be thus ef|fected.</P>
<P>The rebellious Part of the&s;e Vagabonds, as al&s;o other Thieves and Offenders, &s;hould be form'd in Bodies under the Command of pro|per Officers, and under the Guard and Awe of our Soldiery. The&s;e &s;hould every Day
<PB N="29" REF="29">
at low Water carry away the&s;e Sand-Hills, and remove every other Ob&s;truction to the Navigation of this mo&s;t excellent and u&s;eful River.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that the Balla&s;t-Men might do this; and that as fa&s;t as the Hills are taken away they would gather together again; or, that the Watermen might do it. To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer, that the Balla&s;t-Men, in&s;tead of taking from the&s;e Hills, make Holes in other Places of the River, which is the Rea&s;on &s;o many young Per&s;ons are drown'd when &s;wiming or bathing in the River. Be&s;ides, it is a Work for many Hands, and of long Continuance, &s;o that Balla&s;t-Men do more harm than good. The &s;econd Ob|jection is as &s;illy, as if I &s;hould never wa&s;h my &s;elf becau&s;e I &s;hall be dirty again, and I think needs no other An&s;wer. And as to the third Objection, the Watermen are not &s;o publick &s;pirited, they live only from Hand to Mouth, tho' not one of 'em but finds the Inconvenience of the&s;e Hills every Day, being obliged to go a great Way round about for fear of running a ground: In&s;o|much, that in a few Years the Navigation of that Part of the River will be intirely ob|&s;tructed. Neverthele&s;s, every one of the&s;e Gentlemen-Watermen hopes it will la&s;t his Time, and &s;o they all cry, the Devil take the hindmo&s;t; but yet I judge it highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="30" REF="30">
that this &s;hould be made a National Concern, like <HI>Dagenham</HI>-Breach, and that the&s;e Hills be remov'd by &s;ome Means or other.</P>
<P>And now I have mention'd Watermen, give me leave to complain of the In&s;olencies and Exactions they daily commit on the Ri|ver <HI>Thames,</HI> and in particular this one In|&s;tance which cries aloud for Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A young Lady of Di&s;tinction, in Company with her Brother, a little Youth, took a Pair of Oars at or near the Temple on <HI>May</HI>-Day la&s;t, and order'd the Men to carry them to <HI>Pepper-Alley-Stairs.</HI> One of the Fellows (according to their u&s;ual Impertinence) ask'd the Lady where &s;he was going? She an|&s;wer'd, near St. <HI>Olace</HI>'s Church. Upon which he &s;aid, &s;he had better go through Bridge. The Lady reply'd, &s;he had never gone through Bridge in her Life, nor would &s;he venture for an Hundred Guineas; &s;o command|ed him once more to land her at <HI>Pepper-Alley-Stairs.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which, in &s;pight of her Fears, Threats and Commands, nay, in &s;pight of the Per&s;ua&s;ion of his Fellow, he forc'd her through <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, which frighten'd her beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; and, to mend the matter, he oblig'd her to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">are, and mobb'd her into the Bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
To re&s;ent which Abu&s;e, Application was made to the Hall, the Fellow &s;ummon'd, and the Lady order'd to attend, which &s;he did, waiting there all the Morning, and appointed to call again in the Afternoon. She came ac|cordingly, but they told her the Fellow had been there, and was gone, &s;o they appointed another <HI>Friday.</HI> She attended again, but to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. Nor have they yet pro|duc'd the Man, but tir'd out the Lady, who has &s;pent above ten Shillings in Coach-hire, been abus'd, and baffled into the Bargain.</P>
<P>It is pity therefore, that there are not Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Watermen, as there are for Hackney-Coachmen; or that Ju&s;tices of the Peace might not inflict bodily Penalties on Watermen thus offending. But while Wa|termen are Watermen's Judges, I &s;hall laugh at tho&s;e who carry their Complaints to the Hall.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Plea in behalf of abu&s;ive Wa|termen is, that they are drunk, ignorant, or poor; but will that &s;atisfy the Party ag|greiv'd, or defer the Offender from re-offend|ing? Whereas were the Offenders &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction, and there puni&s;h'd, or &s;entenc'd to work at the Sand-Hills afore|mention'd for a Time, &s;uitable to the Nature of their Crimes, the Terror of &s;uch Puni&s;h|ments might make them fearful of offending, to the great Quiet of the Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="32">
Now it will be ask'd, How &s;hall we have our Shoes clean'd, or how are the&s;e indu|&s;trious Poor to be maintain'd? To this I an|&s;wer, that the Places of the&s;e Vagabonds may be very well &s;upply'd by great Num|bers of ancient Per&s;ons, poor Widows and others, who have not enough from their re|&s;pective Pari&s;hes to maintain 'em. The&s;e poor People I would have authoriz'd and &s;tation'd by the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, or other Magi&s;trates. Each of the&s;e &s;hould have a particular Walk or Stand, and no other Shoe-cleaner &s;hould come into that Walk unle&s;s the Per&s;on misbehave and be remov'd. Nor &s;hould any Per&s;on clean Shoes in the Streets, but the&s;e autho|riz'd Shoe-cleaners, who &s;hould have &s;ome Mark of Di&s;tinction, and be under the im|mediate Government of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace.</P>
<P>Thus would many Thou&s;ands of poor People be provided for, without burthening their Pari&s;hes. Some of the&s;e may earn a Shilling or two in a Day, and none le&s;s then &s;ix Pence or thereabouts. And lea&s;t the old Jappanners &s;hould appear again, in the &s;hape of Link-Boys, and &s;o knock down Gentlemen in Drink, and lead others out of the Way into dark remote Places, where they either put out their Lights and rob 'em them&s;elves, or run away and leave 'em
<PB N="33" REF="33">
to be pillag'd by others, or perform any other Part of the thieving Function, I would have no Per&s;on carry a Link for Hire but &s;ome of the&s;e indu&s;trious Poor, and the&s;e not without &s;ome Ticket or Badge, to let People know who they tru&s;t. Thus would the Streets be clear'd Night and Day of the&s;e Vermin: Nor would Oaths, Skirmi&s;hes, Bla&s;phemy, ob&s;cene Talk, or other wicked Examples be &s;o publick and frequent. All gaming at Orange and Gingerbread-Barrows &s;hould be aboli&s;h'd, as al&s;o all Penny and half Penny Lotteries, Thimbles and Balls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o frequent in <HI>Moorfields, Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> &amp;c. where Idle Fellows re|&s;ort, to play with Children and Apprentices, and tempt them to &s;teal their Parents or Ma|&s;ters Money.</P>
<P>There is one admirable Cu&s;tom in the City of <HI>London,</HI> which I could wi&s;h were imitated in the City and Liberties of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> and Bills of Mortality, which is, no Porter can carry a Burthen, or Letter, in the City unle&s;s he be a Ticket-Porter: Whereas out of the Freedom-part of <HI>London,</HI> any Per&s;on may take a Knot and turn Porter, 'till he be intru&s;ted with &s;omething of Value, and then you never hear of him more. This is very common and ought to be amended. I would therefore have all Porters under &s;ome &s;uch Regulation as Coachmen, Chairmen, Car|men
<PB N="34" REF="34">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> a Man may then know whom he intru&s;ts, and not run the Ri&s;que of lo&s;ing his Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay I would not have a Per&s;on carry a Basket in the Markets, who is not &s;ubject to &s;ome &s;uch Regulation; for very many Per&s;ons oftentimes lo&s;e their Din|ner in &s;ending their Meat home by Per&s;ons they know nothing of.</P>
<P>Thus would all our Poor be &s;tation'd, and a Man or Woman, able to perform any of the&s;e Offices, mu&s;t either comply or be term'd an idle Vagrant, and &s;o &s;ent to a Place where they &s;hall be forc'd to work. By this means Indu&s;try will be encourag'd, Idlene&s;s puni&s;h'd, and we &s;hall be fam'd, as well as happy, for our Tranquility and Decorum.</P>
