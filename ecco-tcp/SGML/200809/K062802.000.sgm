<HEAD>THE MAGDALENS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LO! kneeling at yon Rail with pen&s;ive Air,</L>
<L>A num'rous Train of &s;uppliant Nymphs I &s;py:</L>
<L>Their youthful Cheek is pal'd with early Care,</L>
<L>And Sorrow dwells in their dejected Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark, They attune a &s;olemn plaintive Lay,</L>
<L>Where Grief with Harmony delights to meet:</L>
<L>Not <HI>Philomela</HI> from her lonely Spray</L>
<L>Trills her clear Note, more querulou&s;ly &s;weet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<L>Are The&s;e the Fair who wont with con&s;cious Grace</L>
<L>Proud <HI>Ranelagh's</HI> re&s;plendent Round to tread?</L>
<L>Shine in the &s;tudied Luxury of Dre&s;s?</L>
<L>And vie in Beauty with the high-born Maid?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;miling Scenes of Plea&s;ure they &s;or&s;ake,</L>
<L>Obey no more Amu&s;ement's idle Call,</L>
<L>Nor mingling with the Sons of Mirth partake</L>
<L>The Treat voluptuous, or the fe&s;tive Ball.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;ober Weeds they change their bright Attire,</L>
<L>Of the Pearl Bracelet &s;trip the graceful Arm,</L>
<L>Veil the white Brea&s;t, that lately heav'd De&s;ire,</L>
<L>And thrill'd with tender exqui&s;ite Alarm:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unbraid the cunning Tre&s;&s;es of the Hair,</L>
<L>And each well-fancied Ornament remove,</L>
<L>The glowing Gem, the glitt'ring Solitaire&mdash;</L>
<L>The co&s;tly &s;poils of pro&s;tituted Love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<L>Yet Beauty lingers on their mournful Brow,</L>
<L>Unwilling to for&s;ake the Tear-dew'd Cheek,</L>
<L>Which &s;carcely blu&s;hing with a languid Glow</L>
<L>Partakes a Softne&s;s delicately meek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more compare then to the &s;tately Flow'r,</L>
<L>Who&s;e painted Foliage wantons in the Gale:</L>
<L>They look the Lily drooping from the Show'r,</L>
<L>Or the pale Vi'let &s;ick'ning in the Vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not the Prude with acrimonious Taunt,</L>
<L>Upbraid the humble Tenants of this Dome,</L>
<L>That Plea&s;ure's ro&s;y Bow'r they us'd to haunt,</L>
<L>And in the Walks of loo&s;e-rob'd Dalliance roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If fond of Empire, and of Conque&s;t vain,</L>
<L>They frequent Vot'ries to their Altars drew,</L>
<L>Yet blaz'd tho&s;e Altars to the Fair ones' Bane,</L>
<L>The Idol They, and They the Victim too!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<L>Some in this &s;acred Man&s;ion may re&s;ide,</L>
<L>Who lo&s;t their Parents in their Infant Years,</L>
<L>And haple&s;s Orphans! trod without a Guide</L>
<L>The Maze of Life perplext with guileful Snares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some, that encircled by the Great and Rich,</L>
<L>Were won by Wiles, and deep-de&s;igning Art,</L>
<L>By &s;plendid Bribes, and &s;o&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Speech,</L>
<L>Of Pow'r to cheat the young unguarded Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some, on whom Beauty breath'd her choice&s;t Bloom,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t adver&s;e Stars all other Gifts remov'd,</L>
<L>Who fled from Mis'ry and a Dungeon's Gloom,</L>
<L>To Scenes their inborn Virtue di&s;approv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' Their Youth imbib'd an early Stain:</L>
<L>Now gilded by the Rays of new-born Fame,</L>
<L>A &s;econd Innocence they here obtain,</L>
<L>And Nun-clad Penance heals their wounded Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<L>So the young Myrtles nipt by treach'rous Cold,</L>
<L>(While &s;till the Summer yields his golden Store,)</L>
<L>In &s;helt'ring Walls their tender Leaves unfold,</L>
<L>And breathe a &s;weeter Fragrance than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' white-wing'd Peace protect this calm Abode,</L>
<L>Tho' each tumultuous Pa&s;&s;ion be &s;uppre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Still Recollection wears a Sting to goad,</L>
<L>Still arrowy Remor&s;e afflicts their Brea&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tort'ring Hour of Mem'ry this may prove,</L>
<L>Who wrapt in pen&s;ive Secrecy forlorn,</L>
<L>Sits mu&s;ing on the Pledges of her Love,</L>
<L>Expos'd to chilly Want, and grinning Scorn:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Left by their Father in the Time of Need,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t in th' unfolding Blo&s;&s;om of their Age!</L>
<L>"Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd Meed?"</L>
<L>She cries: Then &s;inks beneath Affliction's Rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<L>Another mourns her Fall with Grief &s;incere,</L>
<L>Whom tranquil Rea&s;on tells &s;he's &s;hun'd, di&s;dain'd,</L>
<L>Repuls'd as vile by tho&s;e who held her dear,</L>
<L>Who call'd her once Companion, Si&s;ter, Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That recollects the Day, when lo&s;t to Shame</L>
<L>She fondly &s;acrific'd her ve&s;tal Charms:</L>
<L>Re&s;ign'd the Virgin's for an Harlot's Name,</L>
<L>And left a Parent's for a Spoiler's Arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagination pencils to her Mind</L>
<L>The Father's Rage, the Mother's &s;ofter Woe:</L>
<L>Unhappy Pair! to that Di&s;tre&s;s con&s;ign'd</L>
<L>A Child can give, a Parent only know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dreadful Picture fixes Sorrow's Dart,</L>
<L>Fond filial Pa&s;&s;ions in her Brea&s;t revive:</L>
<L>She feels keen Angui&s;h preying at her Heart,</L>
<L>To Nature's Pangs too &s;en&s;ibly alive.</L>

<PB N="11" REF="9">
<L>If this, or &s;imilar tormenting Thought,</L>
<L>Cling to their Soul, when pen&s;ively alone,</L>
<L>For Youth's Offence, for Love's alluring Fault,</L>
<L>Say, do they not &s;ufficiently atone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O mock not then their penitential Woes,</L>
<L>Thou, who may'&s;t deign to mark this humble Theme,</L>
<L>Nor &s;eek with foul Deri&s;ion to expo&s;e</L>
<L>And give to Infamy their tainted Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem me one of Melancholy's Train,</L>
<L>If anxious for the Sorrow-wedded Fair,</L>
<L>(Tho' little &s;kilful of poetic Strain</L>
<L>Who&s;e plea&s;ing Mu&s;ic takes the tuneful Ear)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I &s;teal impatient from the idle Throng,</L>
<L>The roving, gay, Companions of my Age,</L>
<L>To temper with their Prai&s;e my artle&s;s Song,</L>
<L>And &s;oft-ey'd Pity in their Cau&s;e engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<L>'Tis Virtue's Ta&s;k to &s;oothe Affliction's Smart,</L>
<L>To join in Sadne&s;s with the Fair di&s;tre&s;t:</L>
<L>Wake to another's Pain the tender Heart,</L>
<L>And move to Sympathy the feeling Brea&s;t.</L>
