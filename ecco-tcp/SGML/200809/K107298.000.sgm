<HEAD>SECT. I. <HI>The Definition of the Soul, as given in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, examin'd and proved erro|neous.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be expected that this E&s;&s;ay, as it is written in Oppo&s;ition to a foregoing, &s;hould deny, without Di&s;tinction, every thing that has been before prov'd or a&s;&s;erted; but it is e&s;teemed more requi&s;ite to the Author's De&s;ign, to prove the Immortality of the Soul, without &s;o much as endeavouring to confute the Arguments made u&s;e of to the contrary, as the Conclu&s;ions drawn from a wrong Repre&s;entation of &s;uch Arguments: We &s;hall therefore, to avoid long and tedious enquiry, allow every A&s;&s;ertion to be
<PB N="4" REF="9">
ju&s;t, that doth not &s;tand diametrically oppo|&s;ite to that great and important Truth, <HI>the Soul is and mu&s;t be immortal.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed therefore, with the &s;ame De|gree of regularity as our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, we &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the Definition there given us of the Soul; which is the following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. We allow that the Soul is an intel|lectual Being, not at all &s;ubject to the Acci|dents and Properties of <HI>Matter</HI> in general; &s;uch as Solidity, Exten&s;ion, Contraction, Ex|pan&s;ion, or any Quality whereby it is rendered local, or in a capacity to take up the lea&s;t, or the mo&s;t infinite Space.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly. That this intellectual Being is acting on only a particular Part of Matter, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Body, by certain inexplicable means, as ut|terly unknown to us, as the means how the Planets act in the Orbits, by wonderful de|pendencies on their proper Centers of Gravi|tation; all which we can attribute to nothing but the Will of the great Creator, from whom they have received &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Laws as are &s;tiled the <HI>Laws of Nature</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="10">3dly. That the Soul is nothing but that Power <HI>in</HI> Man, or rather acting on the Body of Man that enables him to perceive, to re|flect, and to will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4thly. That the <HI>Soul</HI> is a <HI>perpetual,</HI> or <HI>con&s;tant</HI> Power of thinking; and that, upon its cea&s;ing to be <HI>Active,</HI> it mu&s;t immediately cea&s;e to be. &mdash;</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It is, &s;ays our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, from the&s;e &s;tated Principles, that a late Philo&s;opher, meaning Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> draws the Inference of the Soul's being immortal.&mdash; But, perhaps, it may be found, at lea&s;t, I am firmly per|&s;uaded, that there is no Man but mu&s;t be con&s;cious on reading the Works of that learned Gentleman; it was from a far more &s;ublime Idea of the human Soul, that he drew tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions: For notwith&s;tanding the above Definition does not contradict the philo&s;o|phical Idea, entertained of the Soul by the be&s;t and mo&s;t rational Philo&s;ophers, it is, neverthele&s;s, a very imperfect one; and not in reality that of the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Man:</HI> For a ju&s;t Definition mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of every e&s;&s;ential Property, belonging to <HI>that</HI> which is defin'd; and that this does not is plainly confe&s;s'd in
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Section the 5th of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, where it is &s;aid that <HI>goodne&s;s of Heart</HI> and the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>judging of Truth</HI> as to the fitne&s;s and unfit|ne&s;s of things are <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the Soul.&mdash;Now both the&s;e Properties are evaded in the Defi|nition, under the general Term of Reflection or Rea&s;on; and tho' that E&s;&s;ay may be &s;up|po&s;ed to prove that a Soul, capable of both Reflection and Rea&s;on, may be as liable to Mortality as the Brutes; which, as is fairly enough prov'd, are as capable of &s;ome kind of Reflection and Rea&s;on as &s;ome of the lowe&s;t of Mankind; yet it is no where prov'd that a Soul, poffe&s;s'd of Goodne&s;s of Heart and that innate Power of judging of Truth, may be, or is &s;ubject to Annihilation. &mdash; It is, indeed attempted to be prov'd, that this Power of judging of Truth is implanted in the Brutes; but it will appear by and by, the Sagacity of their Actions may be much more ea&s;ily accounted for, without this &s;up|po&s;ition; and as to this innate Goodne&s;s of Heart, there made nece&s;&s;ary to the Produc|tion of Virtue, notwith&s;tanding it is allowed to be <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the Soul, it is not at all brought to &s;tand in the Compari&s;on between the Souls of <HI>Brutes</HI> and <HI>Men.</HI> It is impo&s;|&s;ible then this Compari&s;on can be ju&s;t, unle&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="12">
every e&s;&s;ential Quality, Mode and Property exactly an&s;wered, both in the Souls of Brutes and Men, to each other. And this Manner of Rea&s;oning, however, &s;moothly it might be &s;wallowed by that weak-thinking Part of Mankind, the Dei&s;ts, is as &s;tupid and ridicu|lous, as it would be to a&s;&s;ert, that a Hor&s;e, becau&s;e he has a Head, Legs, and other Parts &s;imilar to &s;ome other Animal, mu&s;t be &s;uch an Animal.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, a very great Error in ad|judging the Source of Virtue to that Good|ne&s;s of Heart, naturally implanted in the Soul; or, as <HI>Watts</HI> calls it, a Di&s;po&s;ition to|wards Goodne&s;s, appearing in &s;ome Degree in all People. For if, as is al&s;o allow'd by our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, <HI>that</HI> is the greate&s;t Act of Virtue which is calculated to produce the greate&s;t public Happine&s;s, it will be found, that Men may have too much as well as too little of this natural Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s, or, as Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> terms it, <HI>Milk of human Kindne&s;s.</HI> But this will more evidently ap|pear by and by.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">The above Definition of the Soul mu&s;t needs be imperfect, as there is a Nece&s;&s;ity we &s;hould have a Source for Virtue in the ratio|nal Mind, and which is allowed e&s;&s;ential to the Soul, and expre&s;&s;ed by the Term Good|ne&s;s of Heart. And yet this is found in&s;uf|ficient of it&s;elf to produce Virtue, which is afterwards allowed to be owing al&s;o in a great Degree to that innate Knowledge of Truth, and that it is from the&s;e two Powers operat|ing in Conjunction, that ari&s;e Actions of Vir|tue.&mdash;Our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, in this Point, &s;eems plainly to be calculated for the Rea|&s;onings of the Dei&s;ts; or, certainly it would never have proceeded upon a Definition of the Soul, that wanted even the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial Property belonging to it&mdash;the <HI>Source of moral Virtue.</HI> And how few Men mu&s;t there be, or, otherwi&s;e, how be&s;otted are they, who can think <HI>that</HI> a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Definition of the Soul of Man, that has neither the Word, or the Meaning of the Word, CONSCIENCE, in it.</P>
<P>If I could be per&s;uaded, indeed, that there was no &s;uch &s;acred Impul&s;e implanted in the Nature of Man, to direct his Actions; I could ea&s;ily agree with our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay,
<PB N="9" REF="14">
in earne&s;t, to favour the Doctrine of the Soul's Mortality. But it is on this only I depend for the Confutation of that Opinion. It is on <HI>this implanted Power,</HI> or, in the Lan|guage of the &s;acred Writings, this <HI>Law of God written in our Hearts,</HI> I am confident I can make appear the true Source of the Uni|ver&s;ality of that Opinion, <HI>that the Soul is im|mortal.</HI>&mdash;From <HI>this,</HI> the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments;</HI> and from <HI>this,</HI> that wide Difference we may rea&s;onably make between our&s;elves and the Brutes&mdash;be|tween the Powers of inanimate Things, or that general Power the Law of Nature; and that intellectual, <HI>immortal</HI> Being, the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>That we may not, however, be accu&s;ed of leaving the Reader in the dark, concern|ing what we intend by the Word <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI>&mdash;our Meaning is, an Impul&s;e, na|turally implanted in the Soul, that infallibly tells us, <HI>we &s;hould act unto all men as we would have them act to each other;</HI> not as we would have them act to us in particular, or tho&s;e we are partial to; for, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, our Affections would &s;o far prevail, that, per|haps, there would be no &s;uch Thing as Ju|&s;tice,
<PB N="10" REF="15">
or, at be&s;t, very little in the World. As for In&s;tance; &s;uppo&s;ing it in my Power, ought I to ward off the Puni&s;hment due to a Villain; becau&s;e, were I in his Circum|&s;tances, and he in mine, I &s;hould no doubt be de&s;irous of his doing me the &s;ame kind Office.&mdash;Certainly, No.&mdash;<HI>Con&s;cience</HI> tells us, that we &s;hould act to each other, as In|dividuals, agreeable to the Duty we owe all Mankind, <HI>viz.</HI> that of promoting the pub|lick Happine&s;s. So that when this tender Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s, or Goodne&s;s of Heart, above mentioned, influences us to a Pity for any particular Vice or Per&s;on, that may occa&s;ion us to act partially, to the Pre|judice of the publick Good; &s;uch a Di&s;po|&s;ition, at that time, is &s;o far from being the <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Virtue,</HI> that it is a very great <HI>Weak|ne&s;s,</HI> nearly bordering on <HI>actual Vice</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now, that there is &s;uch an innate Prin|ciple implanted in the Soul of Man, tho' the Arguments of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay allow it, I need go no further than to appeal to every Man's &s;elf for an Evidence of it.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="11" REF="16">
<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>The Univer&s;ality of the Opinion in relation to the Soul's Immortality, enquired into.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;econd Section, our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, after having notic'd how exten&s;ive and general the Opinion of the Soul's Immorta|lity is; which, with &s;ome Degree of Ju&s;tice, is attributed chiefly to the Prejudice of Edu|cation, proceeds to examine, &s;uppo&s;ing it not to be communicated by any adventitious Means, whether or no it be an <HI>&igrave;nnate</HI> Idea naturally implanted in the Soul: And, from Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Denial of the Doctrine of innate Ideas, a Conclu&s;ion is drawn, that this Be|lief of the Soul's Immortality ari&s;es only from the Powers of Rea&s;on being vitiated and mi&s;|led by a certain Plea&s;ure attendant on our Ideas of Immortality; and al&s;o that it is not owing to the ju&s;t Exertion of that implanted Knowledge of Truth, or Power of judging of the Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s of Things, which (notwith&s;tanding the Doctrine of in|nate Ideas is di&s;allowed) is granted to be e&s;|&s;ential to the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17">In An&s;wer to this, &mdash;we will take it for Truth, that there are no Ideas <HI>innate,</HI> any otherwi&s;e than our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay allows. It is there a&s;&s;erted, that no Man can think o|therwi&s;e than that <HI>two</HI> and <HI>two</HI> make <HI>four</HI>&mdash; that when a Globe is exactly fitted into a round Ca&s;e, there is a Fitne&s;s between the&s;e two Things, and &s;uch like.&mdash;This he is convinced of from that certain and unaltera|ble Impul&s;e within, &mdash;now equally e&s;&s;ential to to the Soul, equally powerful to e&s;tabli&s;h its own &s;acred and undeniable Truths, is that Impul&s;e called <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>It behoves us then to con&s;ider how far may a Man's Con&s;cience convince him that the Soul is immortal;&mdash;but, before we re|ply to this, we &s;hall a little examine the rea|&s;on given in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay as the Source of this Opinion.&mdash;It &s;ays, <Q>It is probable that a Man, who had never heard of the Soul's being immortal, might neverthele&s;s be of that Opinion: Yet this Belief is oc|ca&s;ioned more by the <HI>Will</HI> influencing, or as it were bribing the Rea&s;on &s;o to con|clude, than from the natural Power of judging of Truth, which is e&s;&s;ential to the Soul: For, from the Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from
<PB N="13" REF="18">
our Ideas, it is natural for the Soul to will or de&s;ire never to be robb'd of that Plea&s;ure, which mu&s;t cea&s;e in its Non-exi&s;tence.</Q></P>
<P>To this an Objection is there propo&s;ed, by &s;aying, <Q>The <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is &s;ubject to the <HI>Will,</HI> not the <HI>Will</HI> to the <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> for you cannot <HI>think</HI> or <HI>perceive</HI> what you <HI>will.</HI></Q>&mdash;This is allow'd true; but thus an&s;wered: <Q>Tho' the <HI>Will</HI> is not the Director of the Rea&s;on, it can and plainly doth impo&s;e fal&s;e and &s;pecious Propo&s;itions on the Judgment, in favour of its own Cau&s;e, and the Conclu|&s;ions form'd in Con&s;equence of the&s;e, is called Partiality.</Q></P>
<P>If this then be the Ca&s;e, that the <HI>Will</HI> doth mi&s;lead the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to conclude, from a De&s;ire of the Soul's Immortality, that that Doctrine is true; why may not a De&s;ire of having it otherwi&s;e, equally mi&s;lead the Rea|&s;on on the other Side al&s;o?&mdash;and this is ap|parently one great Proof that tho&s;e People who oppo&s;e the Immortality of the Soul, whatever may be their Preten&s;ions, are really very de&s;irous that it &s;hould be mortal.&mdash; And this, very aptly, agrees with the Re|flection there made, of the Difficulty attend|ing
<PB N="14" REF="19">
the Per&s;ua&s;ion of People into a Belief of any Sy&s;tem, again&s;t which they are bia&s;&s;ed and partial; and the ea&s;ier Con|currence to the Credit of any thing by tho&s;e who are no ways prejudiced again&s;t it.&mdash; After this, our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay proceeds to remark, that all, or the greate&s;t Part of Mankind, have naturally the De&s;ire of Im|mortality; and that the Reflection <HI>Cato</HI> makes is applicable to all.
<Q><L>Whence is this plea&s;ing Hope, this fond De&s;ire,</L>
<L>This longing after Immortality;</L>
<L>Or whence this &s;ecret Dread, and inward Horror</L>
<L>Of falling into nought? &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this is no more evident than the A&s;|&s;ertion, that the Philo&s;ophical Antients believ'd as much as the Moderns, this Opi|nion of the Soul's Immortality; of which <HI>Socrates</HI> is brought as an In&s;tance; for <HI>So|crates</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, that the Things relating to the Soul's Immortality, were di&s;believed by the greate&s;t Part of the World.&mdash;<HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, that his Opinion about the Soul's Im|mortality was contradicted by mo&s;t of the
<PB N="15" REF="20">
<HI>Epicureans,</HI> as well as the learned of other Denominations.&mdash; <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> did not at all believe it, as he maintain'd <HI>Death</HI> to be the mo&s;t terrible Thing in Nature, as putting an End to every Thing.&mdash;<HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> &s;ays, that it was often controverted by the Sto|icks, who were indeed very dubious con|cerning the Veracity of it.&mdash;The learned Dr. <HI>Clark</HI> al&s;o tells us, there were many whole Sects of Philo&s;ophers, who ab&s;olute|ly denied the Immortality of the Soul, and that even the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of them did not always expre&s;s them&s;elves with the &s;ame Confidence concerning it.&mdash;Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> &s;ays, it is generally agreed among the An|tients, that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> who taught this Opinion,&mdash; we are al&s;o in|formed, by many, that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were the fir&s;t who a&s;&s;erted the Immortality of the Soul, or its Tran&s;migration. Now from the&s;e In&s;tances it appears, that what was in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay offer'd for the Argument, had very little Veracity in it, and I think it very rational to believe, that, if &s;uch a &s;trong De&s;ire of Immortality was e&s;&s;ential to the Soul of Man, all the&s;e Philo&s;ophers would have found Rea&s;ons, of &s;ome Kind or other, to &s;upport them&s;elves in the Be|lief
<PB N="16" REF="21">
of this Doctrine; however they might du&s;&s;ent in other Points of le&s;s Importance. It is al&s;o plain, that a Man influenced with &s;o &s;trong a De&s;ire of Immortality, could not be brought to acquie&s;ce in the Unbelief of it, without &s;ome very &s;triking Proof to the contrary; and I am pretty certain it will be allowed on all Sides, that the antient Philo&s;ophers had much le&s;s to offer again&s;t the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality, than even a modern Dei&s;t.&mdash;But let us come now to con&s;ider, by what Means a Man's Con&s;cience may convince him, that the Soul is immortal.&mdash;Our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay al|lows, that the Nece&s;&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, if true, would make &s;trongly for the Immortality of the Soul; and &s;ays, that the Opinion of &s;uch a Nece&s;|&s;ity has been entertained by Philo&s;ophers of all Ages.&mdash;Now, tho' we dont allow e|ven this Opinion to have been &s;o general as there intimated, as it would of nece&s;&s;ity have made the Doctrine of the Soul's Im|mortality equally univer&s;al, yet we mu&s;t own the&s;e were the Sentiments of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, and their only Rea&s;on for believing the Soul immor|tal. &mdash; If it can be prov'd then, that this

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Rea&s;ons for the Mortality of the Soul exa|mined.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this Section of our oppo&s;ite Treati&s;e, is pretended an Examination of the Proofs offer'd, in Favour of the Immortality of the Soul, wherein the two Corollaries of Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> in which he gives his Rea&s;ons for &s;upporting that Doctrine, are with &s;ome Ju&s;tice &s;hewn to have le&s;s Weight than they
<PB N="18" REF="23">
are generally &s;uppo&s;ed.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s the Arguments, there made u&s;e of, are very far from &s;upporting the oppo&s;ite Opinion.</P>
<P>The chief Point there controverted, and on which the whole Weight of that Section depends, is, that the Powers of Reflection or Rea&s;on, are equally liable to be affected by Accidents peculiar to the Body, with the Powers of Sen&s;ation; as is in&s;tanc'd by Ex|amples of Lunatics and maim'd Per&s;ons. And, upon this Argument, which we will &s;uppo&s;e to be true, it is concluded, that when the Powers of Sen&s;ation, cea&s;e to act by Death, the Powers of Reflection cea&s;e al&s;o; and, cea&s;ing to <HI>act,</HI> con&s;equently cea&s;e to <HI>be:</HI> And thus the Soul, con&s;i&s;ting only of the&s;e Powers, cea&s;es to be, or is annihilated.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, &mdash;if, when the&s;e Powers cea&s;e to <HI>act,</HI> they cea&s;e to <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> and, if a Lunatic may be entirely incapable of Rea&s;on or Reflection, as in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay is &s;uppo&s;ed, tho&s;e Powers cea&s;ing to <HI>act,</HI> con&s;equently cea&s;e to be: How comes it then, that he is re&s;tor'd, &s;o as to be capa|citated to reflect and judge, as nicely as ever, unle&s;s, by the Re&s;toration of the Body,
<PB N="19" REF="24">
this e&s;&s;ential Property of the Soul again ex|i&s;ts; which is &s;tupidly con&s;idering the Soul as owing it&s;elf to, or a Property of, the Bo|dy, in direct Oppo&s;ition to what our oppo|&s;ite E&s;&s;ay allows, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Soul is a Being in it&s;elf, and not a <HI>Property</HI> belong|ing to <HI>Matter.</HI>&mdash;Or, &s;uppo&s;ing, that while either the Powers of Sen&s;ation or Rea&s;on re|main active, we &s;hould &s;ay the Soul exi&s;ts, as undoubtedly it does, and that, tho' the Soul, in all its Faculties, cea&s;ing to be active, cea&s;es to <HI>be,</HI> (tho' &s;everal of its e&s;&s;ential Qualities may cea&s;e to act and yet exi&s;t, as hereafter will appear) yet, notwith&s;tanding, as the Powers of Rea&s;on, in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;ublime Fa|culties of the Soul; how comes it that the&s;e Powers of Rea&s;on, may cea&s;e to be active, and yet tho&s;e of Sen&s;ation retain their native U&s;e and Vigour; while, if tho&s;e of Sen&s;ation cea&s;e to act, it is &s;aid, tho&s;e of Reflection mu&s;t cea&s;e to act al&s;o; and ac|cordingly the Soul cea&s;e to be.&mdash; And this is allow'd in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, where it is a&s;&s;erted, a Lunatic that cannot remem|ber, reflect, or judge, may be &s;en&s;ible he hears, &s;ees, and feels.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25">Now, is it not rational to conclude, if the&s;e e&s;&s;ential Powers of <HI>Reflection</HI> or <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> can remain inactive, and the Powers of <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> perform all their intended Offices; that, on the other Side, tho&s;e of <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> may cea&s;e to act, and yet tho&s;e of <HI>Reflec|tion</HI> remain active and exi&s;ting: Or el&s;e, we make the Powers of Rea&s;on much more liable to be affected with Accidents, peculiar to the Body, than tho&s;e of Sen&s;a|tion, and &s;o &s;ubject the <HI>greater</HI> Faculties of the Soul to the <HI>le&s;s:</HI> By which means, our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay has been fooli&s;hly endeavour|ing to prove, that the Powers of Reflec|tion or Rea&s;on are not immortal, after hav|ing taken it for granted, tho&s;e of Sen&s;ation are not, which, according to this Conclu|&s;ion, are le&s;s affected by the Body than tho&s;e of Reflection.</P>
<P>Hence we mu&s;t certainly conclude, that either the Powers of Rea&s;on and Sen&s;ation, as there under&s;tood, do not perfectly con|&s;titute the Soul of Man; or, that they may cea&s;e to <HI>act,</HI> or, to the utmo&s;t of our Apprehen&s;ion, appear &s;o to do, without cea&s;ing to <HI>exi&s;t;</HI> both of which will, by and by, be made evident.&mdash;Yet, for the
<PB N="21" REF="26">
pre&s;ent we &s;hall conclude with the former, that there may be Souls that have both the Powers of Reflection and Sen&s;ation, and yet not be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with the Soul of <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>What therefore is &s;aid in this Section, re|lating to tho&s;e Powers, that are here <HI>&s;uppos'd,</HI> or we will allow <HI>prov'd,</HI> to be &s;ubject to Ac|cidents peculiar to that Body or Part of Mat|ter on which they act, does not in the lea&s;t argue again&s;t the Immortality of the <HI>Soul of Man,</HI> as it has been prov'd in Sect. I. it doth not con&s;i&s;t only of tho&s;e Powers.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o, in this third Section of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, another Objection endeavour'd to be &s;olv'd or rather evaded; and this is one of <HI>Watts</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertions, that&mdash;<HI>the Soul cannot lay a&s;ide its own thinking, &mdash;it cannot put it&s;elf out off Being.</HI></P>
<P>To this it is an&s;wered, that it is po&s;&s;ible for a Man to take a Pi&s;tol and blow his Brains out; by which Action he, at once, annihilates the Powers of Sen&s;ation, no incon&s;iderable E&s;|&s;ence of the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">We will &s;uppo&s;e then, in order to re|ply to this, that every Man is &s;o far a free Agent, that he may or may not, ju&s;t as he plea&s;es, annihilate the Powers of Sen&s;ation; for Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, that the Soul, in a &s;eparate State from the Body, is freed from all the Avocations of Sen&s;ations and &s;en&s;ible Things: And there|fore we may &s;ay, tho' not very ju&s;tly, <HI>Death</HI> annihilates the Powers of Sen&s;ation.&mdash;But, what if it does, is the Soul thereby annihi|lated, becau&s;e one particular Property of it is render'd inactive; a Property, there allow'd, e&s;&s;ential to it no longer than while acting on the Body, and at its Departure from which, there &s;eems no manner of Nece&s;&s;ity for it to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed off&mdash;Certainly, No;&mdash;unle&s;s you will &s;ay that a Man, born incapable, or de|prived of &s;everal of the Means of Sen&s;ation, as <HI>hearing, &s;eeing,</HI> &amp;c. is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a perfect human Soul; becau&s;e all the Powers of Sen&s;ation, e&s;&s;ential to the Soul's Exi&s;tence, do not appear to be active, &s;o, con&s;equently, do not exi&s;t. And this, no one will pretend to a&s;&s;ert; becau&s;e the Rea&s;on why tho&s;e par|ticular &s;en&s;ative Qualities of the Soul are thus, inactive, is, for the mo&s;t part, apparently, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome Defect in the bodily Or|gans
<PB N="23" REF="28">
of Sen&s;ation; as is plain, from the many Cures that have been performed on Per&s;ons born with and long labouring under &s;uch Defects; I &s;ay, this, no Body will pre|tend to offer for that Rea&s;on, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time it be al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that an Oculi&s;t that re&s;tores a Man, born blind, to &s;ight, adds a new Faculty to his Soul, which was before as imperfect as his Body: which is, in Effect, making the Soul owe its Exi&s;tence to the Body; a Manner of Rea&s;oning, which, as our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay di&s;allows, has no need here of being di&s;proved, as el&s;e it might ea|&s;ily be.</P>
<P>Is it not obvious then, from hence, that the Powers of <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> are all perfect in the Soul; tho' from the Defects of that Body, on which it acts, it &s;hall not be able to ac|quire one Idea relative to tho&s;e Things, of which, had the Organs of the Body been perfect, it mu&s;t have known &s;omething.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it is clearly evident, with what has been above &s;aid concerning the Powers of Reflection or Rea&s;on, that tho&s;e both of Sen&s;ation and Reflection may be inactive, at lea&s;t &s;o to our &s;tricte&s;t Inquiry, and yet have their Exi&s;tence in the Soul, whether acting
<PB N="24" REF="29">
on or in a State of Separation from the Body. For, tho' Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> allows, the Soul is free from all the Avocations of Sen&s;ations and &s;en&s;ible Things, when parted from the Body, yet it cannot be argued from hence, that the Soul is bereft or deprived of the Powers of Sen&s;ation, any more than that the Soul of a Man, which, by the Imperfection of his Body, is a Stranger to the Avocations of many of the&s;e Sen&s;ations, therefore it is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e Powers; which, from what we have ju&s;t in&s;tanc'd, is evidently fal&s;e. Thus, the Powers of Sen&s;ation may exi&s;t in the Soul, after the Death of the Body; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the Truth of the Re|&s;urrection of that Body, be immediately able to act on it without receiving any new e&s;&s;en|tial Properties of Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Neither do tho&s;e Arguments at all cla&s;h with that Axiom of Dr. <HI>Watts, that the Soul is a con&s;tant or perpetual Power of thinking, and that upon its cea&s;ing to be active it mu&s;t immediately cea&s;e to be;</HI> for, even &s;uppo&s;ing that by Death the Powers of Sen&s;ation, held e&s;&s;ential to the Soul, &s;hould be annihilated; yet, if tho&s;e of Reflection remain active, the Soul certainly exi&s;ts as a perfect Being, as
<PB N="25" REF="30">
much as when it was acting on a Body, who&s;e Defects were &s;uch that render'd many of the Powers both of Reflection and Sen|&s;ation inactive, and in this Sen&s;e, non-exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>And there is none, I believe, &s;o ab&s;urd as to imagine, that, tho' a Man &s;hould be born blind, deaf, or devoid of the Faculties of Memory and Rea&s;oning to the greate&s;t De|gree, on the&s;e Accounts, his Soul has not as good a Title to Immortality, as tho&s;e Men who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the&s;e Qualifica|tions.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, tho' the fir&s;t Co|rollary of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> is remarkable, more for the Veracity of its A&s;&s;ertions, than for the Weight of Argument in favour of the Soul's Immortality; yet his &s;econd Corollary ap|pears evidently ju&s;t and rational;&mdash;<Q>That when the human Body dies, the Soul ex|i&s;ts and continues to think and act in a &s;eparate State: And, when it is freed from all the Avocations of Sen&s;ations and &s;en&s;ible Things, it will live more entirely in the Reflection on its own Operations, and will commence a State of Happine&s;s

<P>In An&s;wer to this, it is &s;aid, that as we are &s;o ignorant of the e&s;&s;ential Greatne&s;s of the Deity, as well as tho&s;e great and extra|ordinary Qualifications we may imagine the Soul po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, we cannot form any ju&s;t: Idea of what Con&s;equence we are in re&s;pect to its wonderful and incomprehen&s;ible Na|ture.</P>

partly thro' Compa&s;&s;ion; as Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> elegantly ob&s;eves:&mdash;For, &s;ays he, <Q><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> endowing Man with the Ability of &s;etting the Memory of the pa&s;t, and conjecturing about the future; and pa&s;t Misfortunes making him apprehen&s;ive of more to come, this di&s;po&s;es him to pity and relieve others in a State of Suffering, and the Pa&s;&s;ion growing habitual, naturally extendeth its Effects to all that have a Sen&s;e of Suf|fering.</Q>&mdash;So far thro' Compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But, continues he, <Q>This is not all; Man's In|tere&s;t, Amu&s;ement, Vanity, and Luxury, tie him clo&s;e to the Sy&s;tem of Benevolence, by obliging him to provide for the Sup|port of other Animals; and tho' it be, for the mo&s;t part, only to devour them with the greater Gu&s;t, yet this does not abate the proper Happine&s;s of the Ani|mals, &s;o pre&s;erved, to whom Providence has not given the u&s;ele&s;s Knowledge of their End.</Q></P>
<P>So that, from hence it is plain, that every Creature in the Brute Creation, tho' acting from Principles in them&s;elves, and for their own Happine&s;s, may yet be ju&s;tly.e&s;teemed as living for the U&s;e and Service of Man.&mdash;
<PB N="35" REF="40">
Now, that Man doth not live in the &s;ame Manner for the U&s;e of Bea&s;ts, is evident; becau&s;e the chief Services that Men perform to the Brutes, are from political Ends; for,
<Q><L>Man cares for all: to Birds he gives his Woods,</L>
<L>To Bea&s;ts his Pa&s;tures, and to Fi&s;h his Floods.&mdash;</L>
<L>That very Life his learned Hunger craves,</L>
<L>Saves from the Famine, from the Savage &s;aves.</L>
<L>Nay, fea&s;ts the Animal he dooms his Fea&s;t,</L>
<L>And till he ends the Beings, makes it ble&s;t.</L></Q>
And that, Self-Love is the ruling Principle in Man, with re&s;pect to the animal Cre|ation, is plain, &s;ince he either pre&s;erves or de&s;troys them, ju&s;t as his Intere&s;t or Incli|nation leads him.</P>
<P>It will further appear that the Brute Cre|ation were particularly de&s;igned for the Service of Mankind, by that very In&s;tinct, or innate Plea&s;ure which they feel in acting according to their Natures, and which, in the Compari&s;on between Brutes and Men, in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, is brought to prove their e&s;&s;ential Equality in rational Knowledge: And this will be evident in their Actions be|ing

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Virtue and Vice, their Foundation and E&s;|&s;ence con&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE has been nothing, &s;ays our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, in all the Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophers, &s;o much conte&s;ted as this&mdash; <HI>What are Virtue and Vice</HI>&mdash;This Point, indeed, has been &s;urprizingly debated, con|&s;idering that every Man, tho' he has no Faith at all in Revelation, has naturally im|planted in him <HI>a &s;acred Impul&s;e,</HI> that can never fail of convincing him, if con&s;ulted, how he ought to act; being a ju&s;t Standard of Wrong and Right.&mdash;It is &s;omething &s;trange, therefore, that Men &s;hould di&s;pute on Terms, who&s;e Meaning they are all &s;en|&s;ible to be but one and the &s;ame Truth.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the E&s;&s;ence of Virtue, we &s;hall agree with our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, in the
<PB N="39" REF="44">
Words of Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> that it is no other than <HI>the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good, or the voluntary Production of the greate&s;t Happine&s;s,</HI> and the oppo&s;ite to this, con&s;equently, Vice.</P>
<P>We will proceed then to con&s;ider the Foundation, or Source, of this <HI>Virtue,</HI> in the Soul of Man.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> allows the Source of Virtue to be that innate <HI>Knowledge of Truth,</HI> implanted in the Soul; whereby we judge of the Fit|ne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s of Things: But our for|mer E&s;&s;ay chu&s;es, becau&s;e of &s;ome little In|con&s;i&s;tencies &s;eemingly attendant on that Sy&s;tem, to declare it is that <HI>pathetic In|&s;tinct</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition toward Goodne&s;s,</HI> as <HI>Watts</HI> calls it, or as it is called there, <HI>Good|ne&s;s of Heart,</HI> and not the <HI>Knowledge of Truth</HI> that is the Cau&s;e of moral Virtue. And yet our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay is afterward o|bliged to bring in this Knowledge of Truth, as e&s;&s;ential to Virtue, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting this Di&s;po|&s;ition to Goodne&s;s in its Offices; without which, it is there made plain, that Di&s;po|&s;ition would not be apprehen&s;ive when to act ju&s;tly; and, upon that Power of judging of
<PB N="40" REF="45">
Truth being vitiated or mi&s;led, this Di&s;po|&s;ition to Goodne&s;s does not contribute to Virtue.</P>
<P>Now, the Powers, both of Goodne&s;s of Heart, and the Knowledge of Truth, are here made equally e&s;&s;ential to the Production of Virtue; and both are, in Reality, equally incapable of that Office; &s;ince it is owned, on the oppo&s;ite Side of the Que&s;tion, that the Powers of Rea&s;on may be mi&s;led by &s;pe|cious Propo&s;itions being offered to them by the Inclinations and Pa&s;&s;ions attending hu|man Nature; as it is &s;aid, in the 5th Sec|tion of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, <Q>Many People run into Vice, by becoming familiar to Actions which at fir&s;t a &s;eeming Nece&s;&s;ity for, impo&s;es upon the Rea&s;on to conclude in &s;ome Mea&s;ure ju&s;tifiable. As a Man that is &s;tarving, might po&s;&s;ibly prevail on his Rea&s;on to conclude, that his Condition extenuates the Crime of his robbing on the Highway, and he may &s;ilence his na|tural Di&s;po&s;ition to Pity or Goodne&s;s of Heart, from a &s;pecious Suppo&s;ition that the Lo&s;ers may not be in a Condition to want, and therefore Mi&s;ery may not be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Action: And
<PB N="41" REF="46">
thus he goes on, from one Step to another, till this natural Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s is not apprehen&s;ive when to exert it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>From hence it is own'd, that the Powers of judging of Truth are incapable of influ|encing this allowed, innate Goodne&s;s of Heart, at all Times, to Virtue: B&uacute;t that it is &s;ubject to Deception, and may be led to Actions of Vice, and at the &s;ame time ima|gine &s;uch Actions not criminal: And with re&s;pect to Goodne&s;s of Heart, it is evident, from what has been &s;aid in Sect. 1. of this E&s;&s;ay, that the Liberty of its Action would in many Ca&s;es produce actual Vice, and that it equally may or may not be in&s;trumental to Virtue.</P>
<P>Now, all the&s;e Difficulties &s;eem'd to be &s;olved in adjudging the Foundation of Virtue to that Power, I call, <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> and which, I believe, is the &s;ame Impul&s;e that Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> meant by his Term, <HI>the innate Knowledge of Truth:</HI> But, by the Definition he gives of it, our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay makes it appear that, in its acting on the &s;ame Prin|ciples, it will &s;ometimes produce Happine&s;s, and &s;ometimes Mi&s;ery; &s;o, con&s;equently, be
<PB N="42" REF="47">
Virtue and Vice, alternately; as is exampled in the breaking or keeping of Contracts.</P>
<P>And, as that Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s, be|fore &s;poke of as the Source of Virtue, is, when not influenced by Ju&s;tice, a very weak, if not vicious Faculty in the Soul, &s;o is this innate Knowledge of Truth al&s;o; for, tho' this Power may be ju&s;tly con&s;cious that two and two make four, and that certain moral Duties are as ju&s;tly requi&s;ite, as <HI>Watts</HI> &s;up|po&s;es; yet, as this Power, relating to Num|bers, however ju&s;tly con&s;cious it may be, <HI>that two and two make four, three times three, nine,</HI> &amp;c. it is liable to draw Conclu&s;ions oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, in the Calculation of per|plexed and intricate Ratios. So, relating to moral Duties; tho' this Power, the innate Knowledge of Truth, may convince a Man that he ought to act ju&s;tly, and that in judg|ing between two Men, he ought not to be partial to either; yet it may &s;o happen, from a Combination of perplex'd and intricate Circum&s;tances, that tho&s;e very Means he takes to do this, tho' the be&s;t that appear to his mo&s;t impartial Rea&s;on, are the very re|ver&s;e to the Ju&s;tice intended.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48">So al&s;o it may happen, from, our Inabi|lity of fore&s;eeing future Events, that the Means taken to promote the greate&s;t public Happine&s;s, allow'd in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay to be Virtue, may be the very Means to pro|mote the Contrary.</P>
<P>From hence then appears, the In&s;ufficiency of that innate Power of Rea&s;on to direct us in the common Affairs of Life: Surely then, that very Rea&s;on will dictate to us, how in|&s;ufficient it&s;elf is to determine; in what De|gree we &s;tand with re&s;pect to that Power that gave us Being; and how little; or how much, we po&s;&s;e&s;s of its Nature, in its Immor|tality.</P>
<P>But from this it may be objected; if I al|low &s;o much the In&s;ufficiency of Rea&s;on to determine this; how can I pretend to <HI>prove</HI> what I am attempting?&mdash;To this I &s;ay&mdash; I attempt <HI>rationally</HI> to <HI>prove</HI> it. Now, the &s;tronge&s;t Argument that can be drawn from the impartial Powers of Rea&s;on, is all the <HI>Proof</HI> Rea&s;on can give: So that a rational Proof can have no other Meaning than the mo&s;t probable Conclu&s;ion, that can be drawn
<PB N="44" REF="49">
from an impartial Enquiry into the Point in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It appears then the mo&s;t probable Con|clu&s;ion, to adjudge the Source of moral Vir|tue to that Power called <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> And then the Ca&s;e will &s;tand thus; every Man, hav&iuml;ng within him this &s;acred Impul&s;e, &s;hould act, upon all Occa&s;ions according to its Dictates: and, as this Power was given by our Creator to every Man under Heaven, ro di&s;tingui&s;h him from the Brutes, and make him worthy of being what his Maker de|&s;ign'd him, the Chief of all his own Sy|&s;tem; it will infallibly convince him, when|ever his Inclinations and Pa&s;&s;ions will permit him, to li&s;ten to its Deci&s;ion; whether or no he acts right. So that, &s;eeing the In|&s;ufficiency of our innate Knowledge of Truth, a Man does not commit a virtuous Action, when going contrary to the Dictates of his Con&s;cience, even tho' the &s;tronge&s;t Appearances of the Con&s;equence of that Action &s;hould be, the Promotion of the greate&s;t public Happine&s;s. And a Man ought never to act contrary to the Dictates of that Con&s;cience, tho' the Con&s;equence of his Actions &s;hould appear <HI>that</HI> of promoting
<PB N="45" REF="50">
public Mi&s;ery: For, as no Man can think that the Author of all Things implanted that Principle in our Souls, for any other De&s;ign than that of promoting our general Happi|ne&s;s, is it not &s;tupidly pre&s;umptuous to think our Creator knew le&s;s than we the nece&s;&s;ary Means to that Happine&s;s. It is al&s;o plain, that, if Mankind were void of tho&s;e ba&s;e In|clinations and Pa&s;&s;ions, which are allowed on all hands to be the Occa&s;ion of the great|e&s;t Part of our Mi&s;eries, and acted from the unprejudiced Dictates of their Con&s;ciences; that we &s;hould have no Nece&s;&s;ity for Divi|nity, Politics, or Law. But as it is otherwi&s;e, every Man being born with tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ions in &s;ome Degree, we find that innate Impul&s;e is not &s;ufficient to influence us to <HI>that</HI> Virtue, it is an infallible Judge of.&mdash; I don't &s;ay, that a true Believer in the Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity, is not virtuous from a much more noble and &s;acred Principle than this of Con&s;cience.&mdash;I rea&s;on here as a <HI>Dei&s;t,</HI> and am fixing the Foundation of moral Virtue in the <HI>rational,</HI> not the <HI>religious</HI> Mind.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be a&s;ked here, to what Purpo&s;e then is that innate Power of judging of Truth implanted in the Soul, if it is not
<PB N="46" REF="51">
to direct the Mind to Actions of Virtue; or to what Purpo&s;e that innate Goodne&s;s or Tenderne&s;s of Heart, before &s;poke of.&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;They are both nece&s;&s;ary to pro|mote the public Happine&s;s, and yet neither of them indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a Man <HI>virtuous.</HI>&mdash;And tho' I allow the Criterion, or Te&s;t of Virtue, is the Confor|mity of our Affections with the public Good; I allow it, becau&s;e I affirm, that acting from the Dictates of Con&s;cience, is Virtue; and that if all Men were to act from tho&s;e Dic|tates, the World would be compleatly hap|py. Yet, neverthele&s;s, as the Pa&s;&s;ions and Inclinations of Mankind, as has been before ob&s;erved, are &s;o prevalent as often to &s;ilence this &s;acred Impul&s;e; this <HI>pathetic Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to excite Benevolence, and the <HI>Power of Rea&s;oning of the Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s of Things,</HI> to direct that Benevolence in the Promotion of the public Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, it is po&s;&s;ible for a Man, out of an extraordinary Tenderne&s;s of Mind, and from an uncommon Share of Rea&s;oning, to be greatly in&s;trumental to the public Good; and yet, at the &s;ame time, be le&s;s virtuous than a Man, who is more guided by the
<PB N="47" REF="52">
Impul&s;e of his Con&s;cience, and has le&s;s of either of tho&s;e other Powers in his Nature. Thus, a Man, that equally acts from the Dictates of his Con&s;cience with another, will be equally virtuous; notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperior Powers of Rea&s;on and Benevo|lence in the one, render him far more con|ducive to the public Happine&s;s.&mdash;This will appear in the following In&s;tance.&mdash; Suppo&s;e two Men were &s;eparately to judge and decide the &s;ame Cau&s;e; both of them equally acting from the Convictions of Con|&s;cience: The one having naturally a great deal of Compa&s;&s;ion, and therefore very de|&s;irous of having Ju&s;tice done to the Sufferer; having al&s;o a large Share of the Powers of Rea&s;on to enable him to detect and unriddle a &s;pecious contriv'd Evidence, formed to &s;creen the Guilty: He, therefore, gives his Deci&s;ion in favour of the Innocent. The other, having le&s;s natural Tenderne&s;s to &s;ym|pathize with the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, does not &s;ee the Injuries committed, in the &s;ame Light; therefore is le&s;s excited to give the Cau&s;e on that Side; and, having al&s;o le&s;s of the Power of Rea&s;on to judge in an intricate Cau&s;e, is led a&s;tray by the artful Preten&s;ions offered on the Side of the Offender, and therefore he
<PB N="48" REF="53">
gives his Deci&s;ion directly oppo&s;ite to Ju&s;tice. &mdash;Now, both the&s;e Men are equally vir|tuous, tho' the Con&s;equence of their Actions, &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other, can never be thought to conduce equally to the public Good: For the Act of the Con&s;cience is as ju&s;t in one as the other; as, the Cau&s;e, tho' it is in Reality the &s;ame to both, is not &s;o to the Con&s;ciences of both; if it was, their Deci&s;ion would have been the &s;ame; and it is undoubtedly no Crime in a Man to judge <HI>wrong,</HI> if he judges, to the be&s;t of his Know|ledge, <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, it is evident, that neither that innate Power of judging of Truth, or that pathetic In&s;tinct, call'd Goodne&s;s of Heart, is the Source of moral Virtue: and, notwith&s;tanding they are both requi&s;ite to balance the Frailties of human Nature, and by that to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary Medium of the public Happine&s;s, yet Actions of Virtue have another Foundation, and a|ri&s;e from an infallible Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s within the Soul, that never influences us to one Action, whatever may be its Con&s;equence, contrary to Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54">Now, our oppo&s;ite Effay &s;ays, <HI>Where is the Ju&s;tice or Nece&s;&s;ity that Men &s;hould be puni&s;hed or rewarded, for acting from Prin|ciples, which they did not give them&s;elves, nor can po&s;&s;ibly dive&s;t them&s;elves of?</HI> Certainly, there is none&mdash;and therefore no one will be puni&s;hed for acting from that &s;acred, Principle in, the Soul, his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If there be a Man then, that, laying his Hand on his Heart, and a&s;king his Soul the Que&s;tion, can reply to him&s;elf that he has always acted agreeable to that Principle, whatever may have been the Effect of his Actions, whether Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery to him&s;elf or others, he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, he has nothihg to fear from future Puni&s;hments: And this he may &s;afely do, if he has had ever &s;o little of this pathetic Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s in his Nature, or has been ever &s;o weak in his rational Determinations: The more, indeed, a Man has of the former, the more Pain he will feel in doing ju&s;tice to the Guilty, and the more Plea&s;ure in protecting the Innocent; and the more Judgment he has in the latter, the better he will be capaci|tated to do both; and make the public Hap|pine&s;s oftner the Con&s;equence of his Virtue.</P>

<P>We &s;hall therefore ju&s;t con&s;ider the Weight of this Inference.&mdash;It is allowed that, if Ju&s;tice is di&s;pers'd to us in this World, it is done by <HI>inexplicable Means;</HI> but, by what|ever Means it may be &s;uppos'd to be done, it is undoubtedly evident we &s;hould be &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="53" REF="58">
that it was done; or el&s;e that Man's Con&s;cience is a Liar, that arraigns him, in his la&s;t Moments, for Actions which the Mi&s;eries, daily attendant on human Nature, have accounted for.</P>
<P>But to corroborate what our oppo&s;ite E&s;|&s;ay here affirms, it is &s;aid, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell how much Vice is atton'd for by the Pains of the Body and Mind; by which it is in&s;inuated, that a raging Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> or <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> may be inflicted on Mankind as a &s;ufficient Reward for their Vices.&mdash;This is a Manner of Rea&s;oning &s;uited to the Dei&s;ts, indeed; for can any rational Man conceive that &s;uch Incidents are adequate Puni&s;h|ments for our Crimes? or, if they were, that the&s;e are &s;o di&s;tributed between the Vir|tuous and the Wicked, as to make up their Ballance of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery in this Life?&mdash;Certainly, No.&mdash;Stupid, re&s;olutely &s;tupid, indeed, mu&s;t they be who can &s;it down with &s;uch Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, indeed, we allow that the&s;e Frailties, con&s;tantly' attendant on human Na|ture, are the Effect of Vice in general; is it not ridiculous from thence to infer they are
<PB N="54" REF="59">
&s;o of Vices in particular?&mdash;Is it a Crime in a Man, that, being nece&s;&s;itated by the Bu|&s;ine&s;s of Life, he runs in Danger of Misfor|tunes incident to &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, and really falls under tho&s;e Misfortunes?</P>
<P>Is it a Crime for a Man to catch a Cold, or be particularly liable to tormenting Di&s;|ea&s;es?&mdash;There needs no Reply to the&s;e Que&s;tions.&mdash;And, if our Rea&s;on is capable of determining any thing, few things are more ea&s;y than for us to be &s;en&s;ible, that the Mi&s;eries daily incident to Mankind, with re&s;pect to Di&s;ea&s;es and other Misfor|tunes of the Body and Mind, are di&s;tri|buted among&s;t us without any partial Di|&s;tinction, relating to Vice or Virtue, in the Per&s;ons afflicted with them. For the <HI>Sun &s;hines upon the Unju&s;t as well as the Ju&s;t:</HI> And the vicious Man is equally intitled to the Ble&s;&s;ings of Nature, in this World, as well as the Virtuous.</P>
<P>Neither is it at all contradictory, our grant|ing that &s;ometimes, in the Ways of Provi|dence, Virtue may eminently meet its Re|ward in this World, or that Vice may meet as con&s;picuous and remarkable a Puni&s;hment:
<PB N="55" REF="60">
Yet when the In&s;tances on this Side are &s;et in Competition with the many of tho&s;e, in which Virtue has been, degraded and Vice bore away in Triumph, that Approbation and Reward, which &s;hould have been paid to its Oppo&s;ite, we &s;hall find our&s;elves inclin'd to think the good Things of this Life rather the Concomitants of Vice than Virtue.</P>
<P>Hence then we mu&s;t conclude, from the &s;tronge&s;t Appearances of Rea&s;on, that the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es of Nature, &s;o far from yielding us &s;atisfactory Cau&s;e to think them Pu|ni&s;hments for Vice, are very convincing Proofs of the Nece&s;&s;ity that there mu&s;t be others, and in a Life after this.</P>
<P>Our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay then, has here ad|vanced nothing to di&s;prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><HI>With the &s;ame Weakne&s;s al&s;o, is advanced a pretended Parallel of Ju&s;tice in the De&s;igns of our Creator, with Re&s;pect to us and the Brutes.&mdash;It &s;ays</HI>&mdash;In what&s;oever Degree we are pleas'd to con&s;ider our&s;elves above the Brute Creation, No-body will deny, but that the great Creator acts with impartial Ju&s;tice towards
<PB N="56" REF="61">
every one, even the mo&s;t minute and in&s;ignifi|cant of his Creatures.&mdash;Why is it then that a Hor&s;e, Dog or Cat &s;hall be nouri&s;hed and fed with all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, while others of their Species &s;hall be &s;ubject to hard Labour, Whipping, or being worried to Death?</P>
<P>From whence it is inferred, that our great Creator di&s;pen&s;es Ju&s;tice to the&s;e Creatures, &s;uppo&s;ing them mortal, in this Life; and, if to them, why not, by &s;ome &s;uch Means, to us? But before we pretend to determine whether or no &s;uch Sufferers as the&s;e are to be recompenced, or to have Ju&s;tice done them, as here &s;uppos'd, it is proper we &s;hould know what Inju&s;tice there would be done them, if &s;uch Recompence and &s;uppo&s;ed Ju&s;tice were neglected; and I think it is obvious, none at all.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the Bea&s;ts free from any Im|putation of Guilt, whereby they may be thought to de&s;erve either more or le&s;s of their Creator; what Right, in the true Idea of Ju&s;tice, have they to expect any thing more from their Maker than he has been plea&s;ed to confer on them?&mdash;<HI>Shall the Clay reply unto the Potter, wherefore ha&s;t thou fa&s;hioned
<PB N="57" REF="62">
me thus?</HI> Has not the &s;upreme Being un|doubtedly a ju&s;t Right to do what he plea&s;es with every Particle of Matter, and every Power in the Univer&s;e?&mdash;Mo&s;t certainly he has: And, therefore, it is no Inju&s;tice to any Creature, that it is made more vile, or le&s;s happy than another; &s;eeing it has no Merit at all in it&s;elf, nor more than a Crea|ture that is le&s;s happy than it.</P>
<P>Has <HI>Man</HI> then any Right to <HI>reply</HI> to his Maker, even &s;uppo&s;ing that, acting from the Pa&s;&s;ions and Inclinations of his Nature, he has not the lea&s;t Imputation of Guilt laid to his Charge? Has he any Right to com|plain that the&s;e Evils, attendant on his mortal Frame, are <HI>unju&s;tly</HI> laid on him; tho' he be &s;uppo&s;ed free from Guilt, and, therefore it may be &s;aid, he de&s;erves not to be afflicted with Pain; yet, as he can have not the lea&s;t Merit but what was conferred on him, what Title has he to the lea&s;t Satisfaction or Plea|&s;ure?</P>
<P>If therefore we enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts of Humanity without de&s;erving them, with equal Ju&s;tice the Sufferings and Inconveniencies of it may be inflicted on us;
<PB N="58" REF="63">
without which, tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts would be le&s;s &s;weet, and le&s;s valuable than they now are.</P>
<P>Thus, it is extremely clear, that nothing is more rational than for us to conclude, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>future Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments;</HI> not only from our ab&s;tracted Notions of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice,</HI> but from the Sickne&s;s, Angui&s;h and Per&s;ecutions of the Virtuous, in this Life; while many of the Wicked are much more free from tho&s;e Em|barra&s;ments.</P>
<P>If then there be a Nece&s;&s;ity for a future Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality has not its Source from a vitiated Power of Rea&s;oning, but has its Foundation naturally implanted in the Soul. And, &s;eeing it is &s;o, it is no Wonder that Opinion is &s;o exten&s;ive: But, on the con|trary, it is &s;omething remarkable that it was not &s;o <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> or rather &s;o <HI>general,</HI> in the earlie&s;t Ages of the World as it is now.</P>
<P>Having now con&s;idered the Objections made to the Proofs and apparent Rea&s;ons for the Immortality of the human Soul, and
<PB N="59" REF="64">
finding them irrational and groundle&s;s; we will proceed to examine the Rea&s;ons that induce &s;ome Men to think it otherwi&s;e.&mdash; To this End we are led to con&s;ider our Re|lation to tho&s;e Creatures, whom we don't &s;cruple to pronounce have no Title to Im|mortality.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Our Relation to the Brute Creation con&s;ider'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this Section of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, is drawn a Parallel betwen Mankind and the Brutes; re&s;pecting the Con&s;titution and nece&s;&s;ary Pre&s;ervation of the Body.&mdash;We are &s;ubject to Death, as they are.&mdash;We cannot live without Su&s;tenance any more than they. &mdash;are as liable in our Natures to Hurts, Pains and Di&s;eases, as they&mdash;and the like.</P>
<P>From this Manner of Compari&s;on there|fore, &s;hould be inferred a Similarity, affecting the e&s;&s;ential Dignity of Brutes and Men; or el&s;e it is of no U&s;e to the Point in De|bate. And yet, it is plain, no &s;uch Infe|rence is drawn: For, after this, it is allowed that, all Matter is <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> the &s;ame, and differs only in its Modification; but that the
<PB N="60" REF="65">
different Modification of Matter gives it no &s;uperior or inferior Degree of Merit. So that this Parallel, relating to the Bodies of Men and Brutes, can have no other Effect than to convince us, they are both equally liable to Pains, Di&s;ea&s;es, and Death: A Truth &s;ufficiently evident, without any great ratio|nal Enquiry: And yet &s;uch Arguments as the&s;e are thought of great Con&s;equence, a|mong the Dei&s;ts; and make up great Part of their <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>rational</HI> Sy&s;tems: For which Rea&s;on it is introduced in this Di&s;|qui&s;ition.&mdash;We &s;hall therefore pa&s;s over this Section, with only remarking, agree|able to our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, that the Form or Body of Man gives him no manner of Title to Immortality, or any Pre-eminence, in the Order of Beings, to the Brutes: But, there being In&s;tances of Creatures, &s;o nearly re|&s;embling the Human as well as the Brute Species, that it has been impo&s;&s;ible to de|termine by their Form, to which they mo&s;t properly belong'd; it is therefore, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that, whatever may be the Form or Properties of Bodies, animated by Souls of any Degree, that the Similarity of the&s;e Properties is not the lea&s;t Indication of the e&s;&s;ential Similarity of &s;uch Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="66">We &s;hall, therefore, proceed now, to ex|amine how nearly the Souls of Brutes and Men re&s;emble each other.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>The Souls of Brutes and Men compared.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay here &s;ays that, becau&s;e, it is not allowed that Spirit is a Property of Matter; but, that the Soul, either of a Brute or Man, is an exi&s;tent Be|ing; the actuating Principle of a Brute mu&s;t, therefore, be of the &s;ame Kind with that of Man; as if it was impo&s;&s;ible that two Beings &s;hould be e&s;&s;entially different. And then it proceeds to &s;ay, what po&s;&s;ible Degree of Inferiority, &s;uppo&s;e the lowe&s;t, can affect any Being &s;o much as to make it mortal, while another Being, <HI>acting in the &s;ame Manner,</HI> is immortal.&mdash; Here again. it is taken for granted, that two Beings, be|cau&s;e &s;uch, and not Properties of Beings, mu&s;t act in the <HI>&s;ame Manner,</HI> without con|&s;idering their e&s;&s;ential Properties. To de|termine therefore, whether they act in the &s;ame Manner, or how far they are e&s;&s;en|tially &s;imilar, we will compare a ju&s;t De|finition of the Soul of Man, with the mo&s;t exalted One of that of the Brute.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="67">We have, in the fir&s;t Section of this E&s;&s;ay, &s;hewn the great Imperfection of the Definition, there repeated, of the human Soul; which is, indeed, as applicable to the Brutes as to &s;ome of Mankind.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then, that we allow, agreeable to the Conclu&s;ions drawn in Section the ninth, of our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, that the Souls of Brutes are capable, as well as &s;ome Men, to reflect, judge, and rea&s;on of Cau&s;es and their Effects; the ultimate End of their Actions is their own Pre&s;ervation and Bene|fit, and the Source of them an innate Self-Love, that directs them to that End.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t noble Definition that can po&s;&s;ibly be given of the Soul of Brutes.</P>
<P>Now, having made it evident, that the Soul of Man, having implanted in it the &s;a|cred Impul&s;e of his Con&s;cience, acts, not only rationally from Self-Love, to his own Pre&s;ervation and Benefit, but from the Dictates of that Con&s;cience, impartial and ju&s;t. It is equally evident, that it is by much e&s;&s;entially &s;uperior to that of the Brute; and that their Manner of Acting is widely
<PB N="63" REF="68">
different. And this Conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t, even tho' we allow, that the Powers of Rea&s;on are, in the Brute, &s;uperior to tho&s;e in &s;ome Men, whom we do not &s;cruple to pro|nounce have immortal Souls.</P>
<P>Our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay &s;ays, take the mo&s;t ignorant of all the human Species, and compare his intellectual Faculties, to tho&s;e of a <HI>Locke,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> or a <HI>Boyle,</HI>&mdash;What a wonderful Difference! and yet we allow the one a Soul as immortal as the other,&mdash; undoubtedly.&mdash;A Man who, thro' the natural Weakne&s;s of his Under&s;tanding, may be incapable of entertaining any, but the mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious Truths, may yet act more from the Dictates of his Con&s;cience, than another, who, with all the Advanta|ges of intellectual Powers, is capacitated to entertain every Branch of the mo&s;t intricate Knowledge. An artle&s;s illiterate Plowman may be a more con&s;cientious or virtuous Man than the mo&s;t learned and wi&s;e Philo|&s;opher.</P>
<P>So that the Dignity of the rational Pow|ers, in the Soul, does not determine its Immortality; notwith&s;tanding, we have al|low'd,
<PB N="64" REF="69">
in Sect. 4th of this E&s;&s;ay, that the extraordinary Acquirements of tho&s;e Pow|ers in the human Soul, may ju&s;tly give us Rea&s;on to believe our End &s;hall not be like that of tho&s;e Animals, who&s;e Under&s;tand|ings are calculated to render them obedient, or, in &s;ome Degree, &s;erviceable to Man.</P>
<P>Now, as it appears, that the e&s;&s;ential Pro|perties of the Souls of Brutes and Men are not the &s;ame, and that their Manner of Ac|ing is not the &s;ame, the Argument offered on this Suppo&s;ition, has no Weight at all.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not here pretend to ju&s;tify Bi|&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Suppo&s;ition, that, becau&s;e the Souls of Brutes are incapable of Good or Evil, Rewards or Puni&s;hments, therefore, they may be perpetually rolling about from one Body to another; neither, &s;hall we commend Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> for giving up the De|ci&s;ion, relating to the&s;e Souls; in which, tho' he might be at a Lo&s;s to determine, whether the Brutes have Souls or no, he might ea&s;ily have made it evident, that, &s;uppo&s;ing they had Souls, they were not only of an <HI>inferior</HI> but of a <HI>different</HI> Nature, to the Souls of Men. And therefore, no Conclu&s;ion could be drawn, let the Ca&s;e be
<PB N="65" REF="70">
decided either Way, with Re&s;pect to their having, or not having, Souls, that could affect the Nature, Rea&s;on, or Religion of Mankind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IX. <HI>The Under&s;tanding of Men and Brutes con|&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING already determined, that no comparative Degree, in the ratio|nal Faculties of the Soul, can entitle any Creature, more or le&s;s, to Immortality: We enter on the Subject of this ninth Sec|tion, meerly to con&s;ider, whether or no, the Sagacity, appearing in the Actions of Brutes, may not be better accounted for, than by our attributing to them the Pow|ers of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, in our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, that, as the <HI>&s;ame Effect</HI> mu&s;t proceed from the <HI>&s;ame Cau&s;e,</HI> therefore many of the Actions of the Bea&s;ts being rea&s;onable, they mu&s;t be en|dowed with Rea&s;on. It is true, they act wi&s;ely, for the Service and Pre&s;ervation of their Species; but this no Proof they act <HI>ra|tionally;</HI> for, tho' Men &s;ometimes, or for the mo&s;t Part, acting rationally do con|tribute
<PB N="66" REF="71">
to the Service and Pre&s;ervation of Mankind; yet. &s;o imperfect are tho&s;e rational Powers in the Soul, in fore&s;eeing the con&s;equence of our Actions; that it often happens, that, acting according to the mo&s;t rea&s;onable De&s;ign of promoting Good; proves the Production of Evil.</P>
<P>Thus, then, the remarkable Sagacity of the Brutes in their own Pre&s;ervation; is no Proof they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Rea&s;on; becau&s;e the Powers of Rea&s;on are not always pro|ductive of that Pre&s;ervation: And it is plain; that In&s;tinct: &s;erves the Purpo&s;es of the Ani|mal equally as well as, or better than, Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>For, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>Where'er full In&s;tinct is th' unerring Guide,</L>
<L>What Pope or Council can, they need be&s;ide?</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> are not the &s;ame Powers, as our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay would infer, will be evident in comparing both. The Powers of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> are capable of entertaining Knowledge, and of making &s;ur|prizing progre&s;&s;ive Improvements in that Knowledge, by Inventions and Di&s;coveries; many of them to the De&s;truction, not the Pre&s;ervation of their Species: And while
<PB N="67" REF="72">
the&s;e Inventions have been formed to the Prejudice of Mankind, equally ingenious have been the Improvements made on the other Hand for their Benefit: Thus, Di&s;co|very advancing upon Di&s;covery, each &s;uc|ceeding Age has acted in a different Sphere of Wi&s;dom; and the nece&s;&s;ary Means of our Pre&s;ervation, are &s;o far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Brute-Creation, that they are infinite|ly greater than tho&s;e of Men in former Ages.</P>
<P>Our progre&s;&s;ive Knowledge in Arts and Sciences, the nece&s;&s;ary Means of the Ser|vice and Pre&s;ervation of Mankind, &s;uffici|ently evidence this.</P>
<P>Now the Knowledge of the Brutes, and the nece&s;&s;ary Means they take for their Pre|&s;ervation, are undoubtedly the &s;ame as they were four Thou&s;and Years ago.</P>
<P>It may be objected to this, indeed, by &s;aying, that Man, having invented other Means for the De&s;truction of the Bea&s;ts, than were practis'd. in the earlie&s;t Ages, we mu&s;t conclude, from hence, that the Brutes take their more improv'd Methods for their Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="73">This Objection, however, has very little in it; for, &s;uppo&s;ing that a Bea&s;t does now very prudently avoid Means taken for its De&s;truction, which tho&s;e of former Ages never met with; this is no Proof that its rational Faculties are more inve&s;ted with Knowledge than its Predece&s;&s;ors; &s;ince, had the &s;ame Circum&s;tance attended a Bea&s;t of the &s;ame Kind many Centuries ago, we have not the lea&s;t room to imagine, but that it would have avoided that Circum&s;tance with equal Circum&s;pection and Prudence.</P>
<P>The Difference between the Powers of In&s;tinct and Rea&s;on, will further appear in comparing the Effects of both.</P>
<P>In Man, we are obliged to own that the Powers of Rea&s;on, given him by his Creator, are not &s;ufficient to acquaint him with the Sciences of Commerce and Government, in their greate&s;t Perfections, without long Application and Study; and that the&s;e Arts have ri&s;en to &s;uch Perfections has been ow|ing to the gradual Improvement made by Men of the mo&s;t refined and exten&s;ive Un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74">In Brutes, we &s;ee no Improvement of their Sciences.&mdash;The Bees always had the &s;ame unalterable Laws and Politics as now&mdash; The Pi&s;mire the &s;ame Oeconomy.&mdash;The Spider the &s;ame Art, and every other Animal the &s;ame Knowledge, in the&s;e Re&s;pects, as now.&mdash;And it is plain, the&s;e Sciences are not in them the Production of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> but of In&s;tinct; for, if of Rea&s;on, wherever there was an equal Share of the Cau&s;e, there would be &s;o of the Effect; and as Man is allowed, in his highe&s;t Perfections, to have a greater Share of Rea&s;on than any of the Brutes; he would undoubtedly be more a|ble to act as they do: and yet, who like the Spider
<Q><L>&mdash;can Parallels de&s;ign</L>
<L>Sure as <HI>De Moiyre</HI> without Rule or Line.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, &s;o far from our Rea&s;on's being able to direct us in this, we cannot devi&s;e by what Means it is done.</P>
<P>So the wonderful Mechani&s;m of the Birds, &mdash;each, in its &s;everal Kind, &s;ingular and inimitable, not only impracticable to us, but to Creatures, &s;o little remov'd from
<PB N="70" REF="75">
them in their Species, that we can &s;carce tell the Difference, unle&s;s by the&s;e Indica|tions of their particular In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>In the Mechani&s;m of Men, we &s;ee, even the &s;tronge&s;t Genius, mu&s;t be indebted to long Application and Practice, before he ex|cels in any Art; whereas, in that of the Brutes, we &s;ee the fir&s;t Attempt equal in Beauty and Elegance to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible this la&s;t A&s;&s;ertion may be de|nied; as it is the Cu&s;tom of Dei&s;tical Di&s;|putants, to deny every Thing that they think cannot ea&s;ily be proved, tho' there be not the lea&s;t Room to que&s;tion its Veracity; but while there is not one Rea&s;on brought to make us doubt this to be Truth, why &s;hould we que&s;tion the mo&s;t impartial Evidence of our Sen&s;es?</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, there appears the &s;tronge&s;t Probability for us to conclude, that the Sagacity of the Brutes, re&s;pecting their Actions, is not the Effect of <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> but of <HI>In&s;tinct:</HI> And this is their unerring Guide.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76">But whether this be &s;o or no; and, tho' the Brutes &s;hould be equally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of ra|tional Faculties with Mankind; all their Sa|gacity cannot, as has been before proved, give them the lea&s;t Title to Immortality.</P>

<P>In An&s;wer to the former&mdash;If, as Effects of the &s;ame Cau&s;e, all the&s;e Powers are e&s;|&s;entially the &s;ame, every Thing that is the Effect of the Being of God mu&s;t be ex|actly the &s;ame too; and then a Man, a Hor&s;e, a Tree, a Mu&s;hroom, have no e&s;|&s;ential Difference; and yet, &s;uppo&s;ing this to be true, it is evident that, with re&s;pect to Duration of Exi&s;tence, there is a wide Di|&s;tinction: And tho' we allow that the Powers acting on Plants, are the &s;ame in one Plant as another; yet we &s;ee &s;ome flouri&s;h but a few Days, and die; others again are more than an hundred Years in arriving to their Perfection: &s;o that the Power which acts on a Mu&s;hroom may exi&s;t but for a Day or two&mdash;That upon a Flower &s;omething longer,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
and that upon an Aloe a Century of Years&mdash; If this then proves no e&s;&s;ential Difference, their being of the &s;ame Nature with the Soul of Man, does not at all argue, that <HI>that</HI> Soul may not exi&s;t ten thou&s;and Years, or to all Eternity.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the latter&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing the Powers acting on inanimate Things, as Plants, Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be annihilated upon the Di&s;per&s;ion of that Matter on which they act: it is becau&s;e the proper Frame of that Matter is immediately affected by their acting; whereas the Souls of Men and Brutes are allow'd capable of acting on them&mdash; &s;elves, that is, by Reflection; for tho' the Organs of the Body, in this State of Union are a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Powers of Reflection, yet the Con&s;equence drawn from Propo&s;itions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a pure Act of the Soul. Hence then the Power of acting on Men and Brutes mu&s;t be left out of this Sy&s;tem; and the Arguments, already advanced, have not on|ly more than amounted to a Probability that the Soul of Man is immortal, but have proved it nece&s;&s;ary, on account of that &s;a|cred Impul&s;e implanted in him, called. <HI>Con|&s;cience.</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="79">
&mdash;Now our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, not &s;uppo&s;ing the Bea&s;ts capable of Virtue and Vice, 'twould be needle&s;s to prove they are void of that Impul&s;e, as they undoubtedly are; and of which, if required, might be given undeniable Demon&s;tration; but, as all the Rea&s;ons offer'd in Oppo&s;ition to the Im|mortality of the Soul of Man, in that E&s;&s;ay, which are the great Artillery of the Dei&s;ts, are &s;ufficiently confuted, in their own Man|ner of Rea&s;oning. I have fini&s;hed the De|&s;ign of the&s;e Di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>From what has been proved then to judge of the E&s;&s;ence of God&mdash;It is rational to con|clude we are not left &s;o ignorant of his Na|ture, as only to know him as the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all Things and no further. Every Man from the Dictates of Con&s;cience, is obliged to own, that the Author of all Things has a Right to di&s;po&s;e of them at his Plea&s;ure, therefore there can be no <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> in the di|vine Being; and this Source of moral Vir|tue in the Mind, convinces us, it being the only infallible Impul&s;e in human Nature, and coming from that fir&s;t Cau&s;e, that this is the true&s;t Image of God. &mdash; Therefore
<PB N="75" REF="80">
the divine Being mu&s;t be all Virtue and Holine&s;s. &mdash; The daily Works of Providence mu&s;t fill every Man with Ideas of the infinite Wi&s;dom and Power of this fir&s;t Cau&s;e.&mdash;So that it is evident, that the Author of all Things or GOD, is infinite|ly <HI>wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>powerful,</HI> and tho' our Ideas of <HI>Holine&s;s, Wi&s;dom,</HI> &amp;c. are the Effect of the rational con&s;cientious Mind, as a &s;econdary Cau&s;e; yet, they have their <HI>Foundation</HI> in God: And, though they may fall &s;hort of giving us a compleat De|finition of the divine Being, they are ju&s;t, though faint, Copies of its infinite Per|fections.</P>
<P>Since the Cau&s;e is really &s;o then, and the rational Powers are &s;o &s;ubject to Error, is it not to the Intere&s;t of every Man, in&s;tead of perplexing him&s;elf with metaphy&s;ical Que&s;|tions, to enquire, whether he acts according to the Dictates of his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>For, however other Points may be deter|mined, this is of the la&s;t Importance, and, perhaps, the only one in which he is an infallible Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81">And with re&s;pect to reveal'd Sy&s;tems of Religion; the Believers of them, if fal&s;e, can be no Sufferers in the End, if they act equally in Obedience to their Con&s;ciences, and it is not at all irational to conclude, that &s;ome Men may have had a larger Share than others, of that Knowledge of the Deity, which is to beacquir'd by the Dictates of Con|&s;cience; and, which may be ju&s;tly called, <HI>In|&s;piration:</HI> And <HI>that</HI> Sy&s;tem is, undoubtedly, the mo&s;t probable to be truly revealed, that is mo&s;t agreeable to that &s;acred Im|pul&s;e: And, that the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem is &s;o, is allowed by our oppo&s;ite E&s;&s;ay, when it &s;ays, <HI>it contains a Sy&s;tem of Morality, truly ju&s;t and noble.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Rea&s;on convinces us, that, being in it&s;elf, &s;o liable to Error, it is rational for us to believe in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem of Religion, notwith&s;tanding there may be ever &s;o many apparent Ab&s;urdities attend|ing it. For, after all our Enquiries, we are obliged to own
