<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I. WONDER what all this heap of &s;tones is for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you&mdash;It is for the lime-kiln; don't you &s;ee it ju&s;t by?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, I do. But what is to be done to them there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they are to be burned into lime; don't you know that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is lime, and what are its u&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you, one; they lay it on the fields for manure. Don't you remember we &s;aw a number of little heaps of it, that we took for
<PB N="2" REF="5">
&s;heep at a di&s;tance, and wondered they did not move. However, I believe we had better a&s;k our tutor about it. Will you plea&s;e, Sir, to tell us &s;ome|what about lime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly. But &s;uppo&s;e, as we talked about all &s;orts of metals &s;ome+time ago, I &s;hould now give you a lecture about &s;tones and earths of all kinds, which are equally valuable, and much more common, than metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be very glad to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then. In the fir&s;t place, the ground we tread upon, to as great a depth as it has been dug, con&s;i&s;ts for the mo&s;t part of matter of various ap|pearance and hardne&s;s, called by the general name of <HI>earths.</HI> In common language, indeed, only the &s;oft and powdery &s;ub&s;tances are &s;o named, while the hard and &s;olid are called <HI>&s;tone</HI> or <HI>rock:</HI> but chymi&s;ts u&s;e the &s;ame term for all; as, in fact, earth is only
<PB N="3" REF="6">
crumbled &s;tone, and &s;tone only con&s;o|lidated earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What!&mdash;has the mould of my garden ever been &s;tone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The black earth or mould which covers the &s;urface wherever plants grow, con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of parts of rot|ted vegetables, &s;uch as &s;talks, leaves, and roots, mixed with &s;and or loo&s;e clay; but this only reaches a little way; and beneath it you always come to a bed of gravel, or clay, or &s;tone of &s;ome kind. Now the&s;e earths and &s;tones are di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;everal &s;pecies, but principally into three, the properties of which make them u&s;eful to man for very different purpo&s;es, and are therefore very well worth knowing. As you began with a&s;king me about lime, I &s;hall fir&s;t mention that cla&s;s of earths from which it is obtained. The&s;e have derived their name of <HI>calcareous</HI> from this very circum&s;tance, <HI>calx</HI> being lime, in Latin; and lime is
<PB N="4" REF="7">
got from them all in the &s;ame way, by burning them in a &s;trong fire. There are many kinds of calcareous earths. One of them is <HI>marble;</HI> you know what that is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes! Our parlour chimney|piece and hearth are marble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o are the monuments in the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. There are various kinds of it; white, black, yellow, grey, mottled and veined with different co|lours; but all of them are hard and heavy &s;tones, admitting a fine poli&s;h, on which account they are much u&s;ed in ornamental works.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;tatues are made of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and where it is plentiful, columns, and porticoes, and &s;ome|times whole buildings. Marble is the luxury of architecture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where does marble come from?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>From a great many countries. Great Britain produces &s;ome, but
<PB N="5" REF="8">
mo&s;tly of inferior kinds. What we u&s;e chiefly comes from Italy. The Greek i&s;lands yield &s;ome fine &s;orts. That of Paros is of ancient fame for whitene&s;s and purity, and the fine&s;t antique &s;tatues have been made of Pa|rian marble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e black marble will not burn into white lime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it will. A violent heat will expel mo&s;t of the colouring mat|ter of marbles, and make them white. <HI>Chalk</HI> is another kind of calcareous earth. This is of a much &s;ofter con|&s;i&s;tence than marble; being ea&s;ily cut with a knife, and marking things on which it is rubbed. It is found in great beds in the earth; and in &s;ome parts of England whole hills are com|po&s;ed of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are chalk and whiting the &s;ame?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whiting is made of the finer and purer particles of chalk wa&s;hed
<PB N="6" REF="9">
out from the re&s;t, and then dried in lumps. This, you know, is quite &s;oft and crumbly. There are, be|&s;ides, a great variety of &s;tones in the earth, harder than chalk, but &s;ofter than marble, which will burn to lime, and are therefore called <HI>lime&s;tones.</HI> The&s;e differ much in colour and other properties, and accordingly furni&s;h lime of different qualities. In gene|ral, the harder the lime&s;tone is, the firmer is the lime made from it. Whole ridges of mountains in various parts are compo&s;ed of lime&s;tone, and it is found plentifully in mo&s;t of the hilly countries of England, to the great advantage of the inhabitants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will not oy&s;ter-&s;hells burn into lime? I think I have heard of oy&s;ter|&s;hell lime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will; and this is another &s;ource of calcareous earth. The &s;hells of all animals, both land and &s;ea, as oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, cockles, crabs, lob|&s;ters,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;nails, and the like, and al&s;o egg-&s;hells of all kinds, con&s;i&s;t of this earth; and &s;o does coral, which is formed by in&s;ects under the &s;ea, and is very abundant in &s;ome countries. Va&s;t quantities of &s;hells are often found deep in the earth in the mid&s;t of chalk and lime&s;tone beds; whence &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed that all calcare|ous earth is originally an animal pro|duction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where could animals enow ever have lived to make mountains of their &s;hells?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, I cannot an&s;wer. But there are &s;ufficient proofs that our world mu&s;t long have exi&s;ted in a very different &s;tate from the pre&s;ent. Well&mdash;but be&s;ides the&s;e purer calcareous earths, it is very frequently found mingled in different proportions with other earths. Thus, <HI>marle,</HI> which is &s;o much u&s;ed in manuring land, and of which there are a great many kinds,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
all con&s;i&s;ts of calcareous earth, united with clay and &s;and; and the more of this earth it contains, the richer ma|nure it generally makes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any way of di&s;covering it when it is mixed in this manner with other things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;there is an ea&s;y and &s;ure method of di&s;covering the &s;malle&s;t portion of it. All calcareous earth has the property of di&s;&s;olving in acids, and efferve&s;cing with them; that is, they bubble and hi&s;s when acids are poured upon them. You may readily try this at any time with a piece of chalk or any oy&s;ter &s;hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will pour &s;ome vinegar upon an oy&s;ter &s;hell as &s;oon as I get home. But now I think of it, I have often done &s;o in eating oy&s;ters, and I never ob&s;erved it to hi&s;s or bubble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vinegar is not an acid &s;trong enough to act upon a thing &s;o &s;olid as a &s;hell. But aqua-fortis, or &s;pirit
<PB N="9" REF="12">
of &s;alt, will do it at once; and per|&s;ons who examine the nature of fo&s;&s;ils always travel with a bottle of one of the&s;e acids, by way of a te&s;t of calca|reous earth. Your vinegar will an|&s;wer with chalk or whiting. This property of di&s;&s;olving in acids, and what is called neutrali&s;ing them, or taking away their &s;ourne&s;s, has cau&s;ed many of the calcareous earths to be u&s;ed in medicine. You know that &s;ometimes our food turns very &s;our upon the &s;tomach, and occa&s;ions the pain called heart-burn, and other un|ea&s;y &s;ymptoms. In the&s;e ca&s;es it is common to give chalk, or powdered &s;hells, or other things of this kind, which afford relief by de&s;troying the acid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, then, <HI>magne&s;ia</HI> is &s;omething of this &s;ort, for I have often &s;een it given to my little &s;i&s;ter when they &s;aid her &s;tomach was out of order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; but it has &s;ome peculiar properties which di&s;tingui&s;h it from other calcareous earths, and particu|larly it will not burn to lime. Mag|ne&s;ia is an artificial production, got from one of the ingredients in &s;ea|water, called the bitter purging &s;alt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what are the other u&s;es of the&s;e earths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such of them as are hard &s;tone, as the marbles and many of the lime|&s;tones, are u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;es as other &s;tones. But their great u&s;e is in the form of lime, which is a &s;ub|&s;tance of many curious properties that I will now explain to you. When fre&s;h burnt, it is called <HI>quicklime,</HI> on account of the heat and life, as it were, which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Have you ever &s;een a lump of it put into water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you not much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it &s;well and crack to pieces,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
with a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, and a great &s;moke and heat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was, indeed. But what is the cau&s;e of this?&mdash;how can cold water occa&s;ion &s;o much heat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you. The &s;trong heat to which calcareous earth is ex|po&s;ed in making it lime, expels all the water it contained (for all earths, as well as almo&s;t every thing el&s;e, na|turally contain water), and al&s;o a quan|tity of air which was united with it. At the &s;ame time it imbibes a good deal of fire, which remains fixed in its &s;ub&s;tance, even after it has grown cool to the touch. If water be now added to this quicklime, it is drunk in again with &s;uch rapidity, as to crack and break the lime to pieces. At the &s;ame time, mo&s;t of the fire it had im|bibed is driven out again, and makes it&s;elf &s;en&s;ible by its effects, burning all the things that it touches, and
<PB N="12" REF="15">
turning the water to &s;team. This ope|ration is called <HI>&s;lacking</HI> of lime. The water in which lime is &s;lacked di&s;&s;olves a part of it, and acquires a very pun|gent har&s;h ta&s;te: this is u&s;ed in me|dicine under the name of lime-water. If, in&s;tead of &s;oaking quicklime in water, it is expo&s;ed for &s;ome time to the air, it attracts moi&s;ture &s;lowly, and by degrees falls to powder, with|out much heat or di&s;turbance. But whether lime be &s;lacked in water or air, it does not at fir&s;t return to the &s;tate in which it was before, &s;ince it &s;till remains deprived of its air; and on that account is &s;till pungent and cau&s;tic. At length, however, it reco|vers this al&s;o from the atmo&s;phere, and is then calcareous earth as at fir&s;t. Now, it is upon &s;ome of the&s;e circum|&s;tances that the utility of lime depends. In the fir&s;t place, its burning and cor|roding quality makes it u&s;eful to the tanner, in loo&s;ening all the hair from
<PB N="13" REF="16">
the hides; and de&s;troying the fle&s;h and fat that adhere to them. And &s;o in various other trades it is u&s;ed as a great clean&s;er and purifier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a thought come into my head. When it is laid upon the ground I &s;uppo&s;e its u&s;e mu&s;t be to burn up the weeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;that is part of its u&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it mu&s;t burn up the good gra&s;s and corn too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Properly objected. But the ca&s;e is, that the farmer does not &s;ow his &s;eeds till the lime is rendered mild by expo&s;ure to the air and weather, and is well mixed with the &s;oil. And even then it is reckoned a hot and forcing manure, chiefly fit for cold and wet lands. The principal u&s;e of lime, however, is as an ingredient in <HI>mortar.</HI> This, you know, is the ce|ment by which bricks and &s;tones are held together in building. It is made of fre&s;h &s;laked lime and a proportion
<PB N="14" REF="17">
of &s;and well mixed together; and ge|nerally &s;ome chopped hair is put into it. The lime binds with the other ingredients; and in length of time, the mortar, if well made, becomes as hard or harder than &s;tone it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of the mortar in very old buildings being harder and &s;tronger than any made at pre&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is only on account of its age. Burning lime and making mor|tar are as well under&s;tood now as ever; but in order to have it excellent, the lime &s;hould be of a good quality, and u&s;ed very fre&s;h. Some &s;orts of lime have the property of making mortar which will harden under water, whence it is much valued for bridges, locks, wharfs, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray is not pla&s;ter of Paris a kind of lime? I know it will become hard by only mixing water with it, for I have u&s;ed it to make ca&s;ts of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The powder you call pla&s;ter of
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Paris is made of an earth named <HI>gyp&s;um,</HI> of which there are &s;everal kinds. <HI>Alaba&s;ter</HI> is a &s;tone of this &s;ort, and hard enough to be u&s;ed like marble. The gyp&s;eous earths are of the calcareous kind, but they have naturally a portion of acid united with them, whence they will not efferve&s;ce on having acid poured on them. But they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the property, that after being calcined or burned in the fire, and reduced to powder, they will &s;et into a &s;olid body by the addi|tion of water alone. This makes them very u&s;eful for ornamental pla&s;ters, that are to receive a form or impre&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as the &s;tucco for the ceilings of rooms.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;we have &s;aid enough about calcareous earths; now to another cla&s;s, the <HI>Argillaceous.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I know what tho&s;e are. <HI>Argilla</HI> is Latin for <HI>clay.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and they are al&s;o called
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<HI>clayey</HI> earths. In general, the&s;e earths are of a &s;oft texture and a &s;ort of grea&s;y feel; but they are peculiarly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the property of becoming &s;ticky on being tempered with water, &s;o that they may be drawn out, and worked into form like a pa&s;te. Have you ever, when you were a little boy, made a clay hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you well know the manner in which clay is tempered, and worked for this purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;and I remember helping to make little pots and mugs of clay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you imitated the potter's trade; for all uten&s;ils of earthen ware are made of clays either pure or mixed. This is one of the olde&s;t arts among mankind, and one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful. They furni&s;h materials for building, too; for bricks and tiles are made of the&s;e earths. But in order to be fit for the&s;e purpo&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary that clay
<PB N="17" REF="20">
&s;hould not only be &s;oft and ductile while it is forming, but capable of being hardened afterwards. And this it is, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fire. Pottery ware and bricks are burned with a &s;trong heat in kilns, by which they ac|quire a hardne&s;s equal to that of the harde&s;t &s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have read of bricks being baked by the &s;un's heat alone in very hot countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and they may &s;erve for building in climates where rain &s;carcely ever falls; but heavy &s;howers would wa&s;h them away. Fire &s;eems to change the nature of clays; for after they have undergone its operation, they become incapable of returning again to a &s;oft and ductile &s;tate. You might &s;teep brick du&s;t or pounded pots in water ever &s;o long without making it hold together in the lea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e there are many kinds of clays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="21">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are. Argillaceous earths differ greatly from each other in co|lour, purity, and other qualities. Some are perfectly white, as that of which tobacco-pipes are made. Others are blue, brown, yellow, and in &s;hort of all hues, which they owe to mix|tures of other earths or metals. Tho&s;e which burn red contain a portion of iron. No clays are found perfectly pure; but they are mixed with more or le&s;s of other earths. The common brick clays contain a large proportion of &s;and, which often makes them crum|bly and peri&s;hable. In general, the fine&s;t earthen-ware is made of the pure&s;t and white&s;t clays; but other mat|ters are mixed in order to harden and &s;trengthen them. Thus <HI>porcelain,</HI> or <HI>china,</HI> is made with a clayey earth mixed with a &s;tone of a vitrifiable na|ture, that is, which may be melted into gla&s;s; and the fine pottery called <HI>queen's-ware</HI> is a mixture of tobacco-pipe
<PB N="19" REF="22">
clay, and flints burned and pow|dered. Common <HI>&s;tone-ware</HI> is a coar&s;e mixture of this &s;ort. Some &s;pecies of pottery are made with mixtures of burned and unburned clay; the former, as I told you before, being incapable of becoming &s;oft again with water like a natural clay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are clays of no other u&s;e than to make pottery of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;the riche&s;t &s;oils are tho&s;e which have a proportion of clay; and marl, which I have already mentioned as a manure, generally contains a good deal of it. Then, clay has the pro|perty of ab&s;orbing oil or grea&s;e, whence &s;ome kinds of it are u&s;ed like &s;oap for cleaning cloaths. The &s;ub|&s;tance called <HI>Fuller's earth</HI> is a mixed earth of the argillaceous kind; and its u&s;e in taking out the oil which na|turally adheres to wool is &s;o great, that it has been one cau&s;e of the &s;upe|riority of our woollen cloths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="23">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I &s;uppo&s;e it is found in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. There are pits of the be&s;t kind of it near Woburn in Bedford|&s;hire. A clayey &s;tone called &s;oap rock has exactly the feel and look of &s;oap, and will even lather with water. The different kinds of &s;late, too, are &s;tones of the argillaceous cla&s;s; and very u&s;e|ful ones, for covering hou&s;es, and other purpo&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are writing-&s;lates like the &s;lates u&s;ed for covering hou&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but their &s;uperior black|ne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s make them &s;how better the marks of the pencil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have mentioned &s;omething of &s;and and flints, but you have not told us what &s;ort of earths they are.</P>
</SP>

<P>I re&s;erved that till I &s;poke of the third great cla&s;s of earths. This is the <HI>&s;iliceous</HI> cla&s;s, &s;o named from <HI>&s;ilex,</HI> which is Latin for a flint-&s;tone. They have al&s;o been called <HI>vitrifiable</HI> earths,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
becau&s;e they are the principal ingre|dient in gla&s;s, named in Latin <HI>vitrum.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of flint gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;but neither flint, nor any other of the kind will make gla&s;s, even by the &s;tronge&s;t heat, without &s;ome addition; but this we will &s;peak of by and bye. I &s;hall now tell you the principal properties of the&s;e earths. They are all very hard, and will &s;trike fire with &s;teel, when in a ma&s;s large enough for the &s;troke. They mo&s;tly run into particular &s;hapes, with &s;harp angles and points, and have a certain degree of tran&s;parency; which has made them al&s;o be called <HI>cry&s;talline</HI> earths. They do not in the lea&s;t &s;oft|en with water, like clays; nor are they affected by acids, nor do they burn to lime, like the calcareous earths. As to the different kinds of them, <HI>flint</HI> has already been mention|ed. It is a very common production in &s;ome parts, and is generally met
<PB N="22" REF="25">
with in pebbles or round lumps. What is called the <HI>&s;hingle</HI> on the &s;ea|&s;hore chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of it; and the ploughed fields in &s;ome places are almo&s;t entirely covered with flint-&s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do they not hinder the corn from growing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The corn, to be &s;ure, cannot take root upon them; but I believe it has been found that the protection they afford to the young plants which grow under them, is more than equal to the harm they do by taking up room. Flints are al&s;o frequently found imbedded in chalk under the ground. Tho&s;e u&s;ed in the Stafford&s;hire potte|ries chiefly come from the chalk-pits near Grave&s;end. So much for flints. You have &s;een white pebbles, which are &s;emi|tran&s;parent, and when broken, re&s;em|ble white &s;ugar-candy. They are common on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and beds of rivers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, yes. We call them fire|&s;tones.
<PB N="23" REF="26">
When they are rubbed toge|ther in the dark they &s;end out great fla&s;hes of light, and have a particular &s;mell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. The proper name of the&s;e is <HI>quartz.</HI> It is found in large quantities in the earth, and ores of metals are often imbedded in it. Sometimes it is perfectly tran&s;parent, and then it is called <HI>cry&s;tal.</HI> Some of the&s;e cry&s;tals &s;hoot into exact mathe|matical figures; and becau&s;e many &s;alts do the &s;ame, and are al&s;o tran|&s;parent, they are called the <HI>cry&s;tals</HI> of &s;uch or &s;uch a &s;alt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not fine gla&s;s called cry&s;tal, too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is called &s;o by way of &s;imile: thus we &s;ay of a thing, <Q REND="inline">"it is as clear as cry&s;tal."</Q> But the only true cry&s;tal is an earth of the kind I have been de&s;cribing. Well&mdash;now we come to <HI>&s;and;</HI> for this is properly only quartz in a powdery &s;tate. If you
<PB N="24" REF="27">
examine the grains of &s;and &s;ingly, or look at them with a magnifying gla&s;s, you will find them all either entirely or partly tran&s;parent; and in &s;ome of the white &s;hining &s;ands the grains are all little bright cry&s;tals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mo&s;t &s;and is brown or yel|lowi&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is owing to &s;ome mixture, generally of the metallic kind. I be|lieve I once told you that all &s;ands were &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a &s;mall portion of gold. It is more certain that many of them contain iron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what could have brought this quartz and cry&s;tal into powder, &s;o as to have produced all the &s;and in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not very ea&s;y to deter|mine. On the &s;ea-&s;hore, however, the ince&s;&s;ant rolling of the pebbles by the waves is enough in time to grind them to powder; and there is rea&s;on to believe that the greate&s;t part of
<PB N="25" REF="28">
what is now dry land, was once &s;ea, which may account for the va&s;t beds of &s;and met with inland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome &s;tone &s;o &s;oft that one might crumble it between ones fingers, and then it &s;eemed to turn to &s;and.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are &s;everal of this kind, more or le&s;s &s;olid, which are chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;and conglutinated by &s;ome natural cement. Such are called <HI>&s;and-&s;tone,</HI> or <HI>free&s;tone;</HI> and are u&s;ed for various purpo&s;es, in building, mak|ing grind &s;tones, and the like, according to their hardne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what are the common peb|bles that the &s;treets are paved with? I am &s;ure they &s;trike fire enough with the hor&s;e's &s;hoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are &s;tones of the &s;iliceous kind, either pure or mixed with other earths. One of the harde&s;t and be&s;t for this purpo&s;e is called <HI>granite,</HI> which is of various kinds and colours,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
but always con&s;i&s;ts of grains of diffe|rent &s;iliceous earths cemented toge|ther. The &s;treets of London are paved with granite, brought from Scot|land. In &s;ome other &s;tones, the&s;e bits of different earths di&s;per&s;ed through the cement are &s;o large, as to look like plums in a pudding; whence they have obtained the name of <HI>pudding|&s;tones.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is a kind of &s;tones that you have not yet mentioned&mdash;precious &s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e, too, are all of the &s;ili|ceous cla&s;s;&mdash;from the opake or half|tran&s;parent, as agate, ja&s;per, cornelian, and the like, to the perfectly clear and brilliant ones, as ruby, emerald, to|paz, &s;apphire, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Diamond, no doubt, is one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it has commonly been rec|koned, and the pure&s;t of all; but &s;ome late experiments have &s;hewn, that
<PB N="27" REF="30">
though it is the harde&s;t body in nature, it may be totally di&s;per&s;ed into &s;moke and flame by a &s;trong fire; &s;o that mineralogi&s;ts will now hardly allow it to be a &s;tone at all, but cla&s;s it among inflammable &s;ub&s;tances. The precious &s;tones above mentioned owe their different colours chiefly to &s;ome metallic mixture. They are in general extremely hard, &s;o as to cut gla&s;s, and one another; but diamond will cut all the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t be very rare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and in this rarity con&s;i&s;ts the greate&s;t part of their value. They are, indeed, beautiful objects; but the figure they make in proportion to their expence is &s;o very &s;mall, that their high price may be reckoned one of the principal follies among man|kind. What proportion can there po&s;|&s;ibly be between the worth of a glit|tering &s;tone as big as a hazel-nut, and
<PB N="28" REF="31">
a magnificent hou&s;e and gardens, or a large tract of country, covered with noble woods and rich meadows and corn fields? And as to the mere glitter, a large lu&s;tre of cut gla&s;s has an infinitely greater effect on the eye than all the jewels of a &s;overeign prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you plea&s;e to tell us now how gla&s;s is made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly. The ba&s;e of it is, as I &s;aid before, &s;ome earth of the &s;ili|ceous cla&s;s. Tho&s;e commonly u&s;ed are flint and &s;and. Flint is fir&s;t burn|ed or calcined, which makes it quite white, like enamel; and it is then powdered. This is the material &s;ome|times u&s;ed for &s;ome very white gla&s;&s;es; but &s;and is that commonly preferred, as being already in a powdery form. The white cry&s;talline &s;ands are u&s;ed for fine gla&s;s; the brown or yellow for the common &s;ort. As the&s;e earths will not melt by them&s;elves, the addi|tion in making gla&s;s is &s;omewhat that
<PB N="29" REF="32">
promotes their fu&s;ion. Various things will do this; but what is generally u&s;ed is an alkaline &s;alt, obtained from the a&s;hes of burnt vegetables. Of this there are &s;everal kinds, as pot-a&s;h, pearl-a&s;h, barilla, and kelp. The &s;alt is mixed with the &s;and in a certain proportion, and the mixture then ex|po&s;ed in earthen pots to a violent heat, till it is thoroughly melted. The ma&s;s is then taken while hot and fluid, in &s;uch quantities as are wanted, and fa&s;hioned by blowing and the u&s;e of &s;heers and other in&s;truments. You mu&s;t &s;ee this done, &s;ome time, for it is one of the mo&s;t curious and plea&s;ing of all manufactures; and it is not po&s;|&s;ible to form an idea of the ea&s;e and dexterity with which gla&s;s is wrought, without an actual view.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like very much to &s;ee it, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is gla&s;s made, in this country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="33">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>In many places. Some of the fine&s;t, in London; but the coar&s;er kinds generally where coals are cheap; as at Newca&s;tle and its neighbour|hood, in Lanca&s;hire, at Stombridge, Bri&s;tol, and South Wales. I &s;hould have told you, however, that in our fine&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant gla&s;s, a quan|tity of the calx of lead is put, which vitrifies with the other ingredients, and gives the gla&s;s more firmne&s;s and den&s;ity. The blue, yellow and red gla&s;&s;es are coloured with the calxes of other metals. As to the common green gla&s;s, it is made with an alkali that has a good deal of calcareous earth remaining with the a&s;hes of the plant. But to under&s;tand all the dif|ferent circum&s;tances of gla&s;s making, one mu&s;t have a thorough knowledge of chymi&s;try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think making of gla&s;s is one of the fine&s;t inventions of human &s;kill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="34">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is perhaps not of that capital importance that &s;ome other arts po&s;|&s;e&s;s; but it has been a great addition to the comfort and plea&s;ure of life in many ways. Nothing makes &s;uch clean and agreeable ve&s;&s;els as gla&s;s, which has the quality of not being corroded by any kind of liquor, as well as that of &s;howing its contents by its tran&s;parency. Hence it is greatly preferable to the mo&s;t precious metals for drinking out of; and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons it is preferred to every other material for chymical uten&s;ils, where the heat to be employed is not &s;trong enough to melt it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, gla&s;s windows!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; that is a mo&s;t material comfort in a climate like ours, where we &s;o often wi&s;h to let in the light, and keep out the cold wind and rain. What could be more gloomy than to &s;it in the dark, or with no other light than came in through &s;mall holes co|vered
<PB N="32" REF="35">
with oiled paper or bladder, un|able to &s;ee any thing pa&s;&s;ing without doors! Yet this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous palaces before the invention of window-gla&s;s, which was a good deal later than that of bottles and drinking gla&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think looking-gla&s;&s;es are very beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are indeed very elegant pieces of furniture, and very co&s;tly too. The art of ca&s;ting gla&s;s into large plates, big enough to reach al|mo&s;t from the bottom to the top of a room, is but lately introduced into this country from France. But the mo&s;t &s;plendid and brilliant manner of employing gla&s;s is in lu&s;tres and chan|deliers, hung round with drops cut &s;o as to reflect the light with all the co|lours of the rainbow. Some of the &s;hops in London, filled with the&s;e ar|ticles, appear to realize all the won|ders
<PB N="33" REF="36">
of an enchanted palace in the Arabian Nights Entertainments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are not &s;pectacles and &s;py|ing gla&s;&s;es more u&s;eful than all the&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean to pa&s;s them over, I a&s;&s;ure you. By the curious invention of optical gla&s;&s;es of various kinds, not only the natural defects of the &s;ight have been remedied, and old-age has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure lightened of one of its calamities, but the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing has been wonder|fully extended. The tele&s;cope has brought di&s;tant objects within our view, while the micro&s;cope has given us a clear &s;urvey of near objects too minute for our una&s;&s;i&s;ted eyes. By means of both, &s;ome of the brighte&s;t di&s;coveries of the moderns have been made; &s;o that gla&s;s has proved not le&s;s admirable in promoting &s;cience, than in contributing to &s;plendour and convenience. Well&mdash;I don't know that I have any thing more at pre&s;ent
<PB N="34" REF="37">
to &s;ay relative to the cla&s;s of earths. We have gone through the principal circum&s;tances belonging to their three great divi&s;ions, the <HI>calcareous, argilla|ceous,</HI> and <HI>&s;iliceous.</HI> You will remem|ber, however, that mo&s;t of the earths and &s;tones offered by nature are not any one of the&s;e kinds perfectly pure, but contain a mixture of one or both the others. There is not a pebble that you can pick up which would not ex|erci&s;e the &s;kill of a mineralogi&s;t fully to a&s;certain its properties, and the materials of its compo&s;ition.

<HEAD>THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a delightful evening about the end of Augu&s;t. The &s;un &s;etting in a pure &s;ky illuminated the tops of the we&s;tern hills, and tipped the oppo&s;ite trees with a yellow lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>A traveller, with &s;un-burnt cheeks and du&s;ty feet, &s;trong and active, hav|ing a knap&s;ack at his back, had gain|ed the &s;ummit of a &s;teep a&s;cent, and &s;tood gazing on the plain below.</P>
<P>This was a wide tract of champaign country, chequered with villages, who&s;e towers and &s;pires peeped above the trees in which they were embo&s;omed. The &s;pace between them was chiefly arable land, from which the la&s;t pro|ducts of harve&s;t were bu&s;ily carrying away.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">
A rivulet winded through the plain, its cour&s;e marked with grey willows. On its banks were verdant meadows, covered with lowing herds, moving &s;lowly to the milkmaids, who came tripping along with pails on their heads. A thick wood cloathed the &s;ide of a gentle eminence ri&s;ing from the water, crowned with the ruins of an ancient ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> (that was the traveller's name) dropt on one knee, and cla&s;p|ing his hands, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Wel|come, welcome, my dear native land! Many a &s;weet &s;pot have I &s;een &s;ince I left thee, but none &s;o &s;weet as thou! Never has thy dear image been out of my memory; and now, with what tran&s;port do I retrace all thy charms. O receive me again, never more to quit thee!"</Q> So &s;aying, he threw him|&s;elf on the turf, and having ki&s;&s;ed it, ro&s;e and proceeded on his journey.</P>
<P>As he de&s;cended into the plain,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
he overtook a little group of children, merrily walking along the path, and &s;topping now and then to gather ber|ries in the hedge.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where are you going, my dears?"</Q> &s;aid Edward.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We are going home,"</Q> they all replied.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And where is that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, to Summerton, that town there among the trees, ju&s;t before us. Don't you &s;ee it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee it well,"</Q> an&s;wered Edward, the tear &s;tanding in his eye.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is your name&mdash;and yours&mdash;and yours?"</Q></P>
<P>The little innocents told their names. Edward's heart leaped at the well|known &s;ounds.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what is <HI>your</HI> name, my dear?"</Q> &s;aid he to a pretty girl, &s;omewhat older than the re&s;t, who hung back &s;hyly, and held the hand of a ruddy white-headed boy, ju&s;t breeched.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41">
<Q REND="inline">"It is Ro&s;e Wal&s;ingham, and this is my younge&s;t brother, Roger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Wal&s;ingham!</HI>"</Q> Edward cla&s;ped the girl round the neck, and &s;urpri&s;ed her with two or three very clo&s;e ki&s;&s;es. He then lifted up little Roger, and almo&s;t devoured him. Roger &s;eemed as if he wanted to be &s;et down again, but Edward told him he would carry him home.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you &s;how me the hou&s;e you live at, Ro&s;e?"</Q> &s;aid Edward.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes&mdash;it is ju&s;t there, be&s;ide the pond, with the great barn before it, and the orchard behind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you take me home with you, Ro&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you plea&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered Ro&s;e, he&s;itatingly.</P>
<P>They walked on. Edward &s;aid but little, for his heart was full, but he frequently ki&s;&s;ed little Roger.</P>
<P>Coming at length to a &s;tile, from which a path led acro&s;s a little clo&s;e,
<PB N="39" REF="42">
<Q REND="inline">"This is the way to our hou&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The other children parted. Ed|ward &s;et down Roger, and got over the &s;tile. He &s;till, however, kept hold of the boy's hand. He trembled, and looked wildly around him.</P>
<P>When they approached the hou&s;e, an old ma&s;tiff came running to meet the children. He looked up at Ed|ward rather &s;ourly, and gave a little growl; when all at once his counte|nance changed; he leaped upon him, licked his hand, wagged his tail, mur|mured in a &s;oft voice, and &s;eemed quite overcome with joy. Edward &s;tooped down, patted his head, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"poor Captain, what, are you alive yet?"</Q> Ro&s;e was &s;urpri&s;ed that the &s;tranger and their dog &s;hould know one another.</P>
<P>They all entered the hou&s;e together. A good-looking middle-aged woman was bu&s;ied in preparing articles of
<PB N="40" REF="43">
cookery, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her grown-up daughter. She &s;poke to the children as they came in, and ca&s;ting a look of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e on Edward, a&s;ked him what his bu&s;ine&s;s was.</P>
<P>Edward was &s;ome time &s;ilent; at length with a faultering voice he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Have you forgot me, mother?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Edward! my &s;on Edward!"</Q> ex|claimed the good woman. And they were in&s;tantly locked in each others arms.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My brother Edward?"</Q> &s;aid Molly; and took her turn for an em|brace as &s;oon as her mother gave her room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you my brother?"</Q> &s;aid Ro&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"That I am,"</Q> replied Edward with another ki&s;s. Little Roger looked hard at him, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>News of Edward's arrival &s;oon flew acro&s;s the yard, and in came from the barn his father, his next brother Tho|mas, and the third, William. The
<PB N="41" REF="44">
father fell on his neck, and &s;obbed out his welcome and ble&s;&s;ing. Edward had not hands enow for them all to &s;hake.</P>
<P>An aged white headed labourer came in, and held out his &s;hrivelled hand. Edward gave it a hearty &s;queeze. <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s you,"</Q> &s;aid old I&s;aac; <Q REND="inline">"this is the be&s;t day I have &s;een this many a year."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And where have you been this long while?"</Q> cried the father.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Eight years and more,"</Q> added the mother.</P>
<P>His elder brother took off his knap&s;ack; and Molly drew him a chair. Edward &s;eated him&s;elf, and they all gathered round him. The old dog got within the circle, and lay at his feet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, how glad I am to &s;ee you all again!"</Q> were Edward's fir&s;t words. <Q REND="inline">"How well you look, mother! but father's grown thinner. As for the

<P><Q REND="inline">"What a &s;un-burnt face you have got!&mdash;but you look brave and hearty,"</Q> cried his mother.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, mother, I have been enough in the &s;un, I a&s;&s;ure you. From &s;even|teen to five and twenty I have been a wandere upon the face of the earth, and I have &s;een more in that time than mo&s;t men in the cour&s;e of their lives.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>KEEPER was a farmer's ma&s;tiff, ho|ne&s;t, brave, and vigilant. One day, as he was ranging at &s;ome di&s;tance from home, he e&s;pied a Wolf and Fox &s;itting together at the corner of a wood. <HI>Keeper,</HI> not much liking their looks, though by no means fear|ing them, was turning another way, when they called after him, and civilly de&s;ired him to &s;tay. <Q REND="inline">"Surely, Sir, (&s;ays <HI>Reynard</HI>), you won't di&s;own your relations. My cou&s;in <HI>Ghaunt</HI> and I were ju&s;t talking over family matters, and we both agreed that we had the honour of reckoning you among our kin. You mu&s;t know,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
that according to the be&s;t accounts, the wolves and dogs were originally one race in the fore&s;ts of Armenia; but the dogs, taking to living with man, have &s;ince become inhabitants of towns and villages, while the wolves have retained their ancient mode of life. As to my ance&s;tors, the foxes, they were a branch of the &s;ame family who &s;ettled farther northwards, where they became &s;tinted in their growth, and adopted the cu&s;tom of living in holes under ground. The cold has &s;harpened our no&s;es, and given us a thicker fur and bu&s;hy tails to keep us warm. But we have all a family likene&s;s which it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;|take; and I am &s;ure it is our intere&s;t to be good friends with each other."</Q></P>
<P>The wolf was of the &s;ame opinion; and <HI>Keeper,</HI> looking narrowly at them, could not help acknowledging their relation&s;hip. As he had a generous heart, he readily entered into friend|&s;hip
<PB N="52" REF="55">
with them. They took a ramble together; but <HI>Keeper</HI> was rather &s;ur|prized at ob&s;erving the &s;u&s;picious &s;hy|ne&s;s with which &s;ome of the weaker &s;ort of animals &s;urveyed them, and wondered at the ha&s;ty flight of a flock of &s;heep as &s;oon as they came within view. However, he gave his cou&s;ins a cordial invitation to come and &s;ee him at his yard, and then took his leave.</P>
<P>They did not fail to come the next day about du&s;k. <HI>Keeper</HI> received them kindly, and treated them with part of his own &s;upper. They &s;taid with him till after dark, and then marched off with many compliments. The next morning, word was brought to the farm that a goo&s;e and three go&s;lings were mi&s;&s;ing, and that a couple of lambs were found almo&s;t devoured in the home-field. <HI>Keeper</HI> was too ho|ne&s;t him&s;elf readily to &s;u&s;pect others, &s;o he never thought of his kin&s;men on
<PB N="53" REF="56">
the occa&s;ion. Soon after, they paid him a &s;econd evening vi&s;it, and next day another lo&s;s appeared, of a hen and her chickens, and a fat &s;heep. Now <HI>Keeper</HI> could not help mi&s;tru&s;ting a little, and blamed him&s;elf for admit|ting &s;trangers without his ma&s;ter's knowledge. However, he &s;till did not love to think ill of his own relations.</P>
<P>They came a third time. <HI>Keeper</HI> received them rather coldly, and hint|ed that he &s;hould like better to &s;ee them in the day-time; but they excu&s;ed them&s;elves for want of lei&s;ure. When they took their leaves, he re&s;olved to follow at &s;ome di&s;tance and watch their motions. A litter of young pigs happened to be lying under a hay|&s;tack without the yard. The wolf &s;eized one by the back, and ran off with him. The pig &s;et up a mo&s;t di&s;|mal &s;queal; and <HI>Keeper</HI> running up at the noi&s;e, caught his dear cou&s;in in the fact. He flew at him, and made

him relinqui&s;h his prey, though not without much &s;narling and growling. The fox, who had been prowling about the hen-roo&s;t, now came up, and began to make prote&s;tations of his own innocence, with heavy re|proaches again&s;t the wolf for thus di&s;|gracing the family. <Q REND="inline">"Begone, &s;coun|drels both!

He was the mo&s;t po|tent prince of his time; commanded mighty and victorious armies; and en|larged the limits of his hereditary do|minions. Louis was not naturally a hard-hearted man; but having been taught from his cradle that every thing ought to give way to the intere&s;ts of his glory, and that this glory con&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="56" REF="59">
in domineering over his neighbours, and making conque&s;ts, he grew to be in&s;en&s;ible to all the mi&s;eries brought on his own and other people in pur&s;uit of this noble de&s;ign, as he thought it. Moreover, he was plunged in di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ures, and the delights of pomp and &s;plendor, from his youth; and he was ever &s;urrounded by a tribe of ab|ject flatterers, who made him believe that he had a full right in all ca&s;es to do as he plea&s;ed. Conque&s;t abroad and plea&s;ure at home were therefore the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>One evening, his mini&s;ter, Louvois, came to him, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sire, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make a de&s;art of the <HI>Palatinate.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This is a country in Germany, on the banks of the Rhine, one of the mo&s;t populous and be&s;t cultivated di&s;|tricts in that empire, filled with towns and villages, and indu&s;trious inhabi|tants.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60"><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be &s;orry to do it (replied the king), for you know how much odium we acquired throughout Europe when a part of it was laid wa&s;te &s;ome time ago, under Mar&s;hal Turenne."</Q></P>

armies in their march, or devoured while green as fodder for the hor&s;es. Pillage, robbery, and murder, are always going on in the out-&s;kirts of the be&s;t di&s;ciplined camp. Then, con&s;ider what mu&s;t happen in every &s;iege. On the fir&s;t approach of the enemy, all the buildings in the &s;ub|urbs of a town are demoli&s;hed, and all the trees in gardens and pub|lic walks are cut down, le&s;t they &s;hould afford &s;helter to the be&s;iegers. As the &s;iege goes on, bombs, hot balls, and cannon-&s;hot, are conti|nually flying about, by which the greate&s;t part of a town is ruined or laid in a&s;hes, and many of the innocent people killed and maimed. If the re|&s;i&s;tance is ob&s;tinate, famine and pe&s;ti|lence are &s;ure to take place; and if the garri&s;on holds out to the la&s;t, and the town is taken by &s;torm, it is ge|nerally given up to be pillaged by the enraged and licentious &s;oldiery.</P>

<P>The pungency of ta&s;te which &s;o many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s, has cau&s;ed them
<PB N="69" REF="74">
to be u&s;ed for &s;allad herbs. Thus, we have cre&s;s, water-cre&s;s, and mu&s;|tard; to which might be added many more which grow wild, as lady&s;mock, wild rocket, hedge-mu&s;tard, and jack|by-the-hedge, or &s;auce-alone. Mu&s;|tard, you know, is al&s;o greatly u&s;ed for its &s;eeds, the powder or flour of which, made into a &s;ort of pa&s;te with &s;alt and water, is eaten with many kinds of meat.

<HEAD>GENEROUS REVENGE.</HEAD>
<P>AT the period when the Republic of Genoa was divided between the factions of the nobles and the people,
<PB N="77" REF="82">
<HI>Uberto,</HI> a man of low origin, but of an elevated mind and &s;uperior talents, and enriched by commerce, having rai&s;ed him&s;elf to be the head of the popular party, maintained for a con&s;iderable time a democratical form of govern|ment.</P>
<P>The nobles at length, uniting all their efforts, &s;ucceeded in &s;ubverting this &s;tate of things, and regained their former &s;upremacy. They u&s;ed their victory with con&s;iderable rigour; and in particular, having impri&s;oned <HI>Uberto,</HI> proceeded again&s;t him as a traitor, and thought they di&s;played &s;ufficient lenity in pa&s;&s;ing a &s;entence upon him of perpetual bani&s;hment, and the con|fi&s;cation of all his property. <HI>Adorno,</HI> who was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fir&s;t magi&s;|tracy, a man haughty in temper, and proud of ancient nobility, though other|wi&s;e not void of generous &s;entiments, in pronouncing this &s;entence on <HI>Uberto,</HI> aggravated its &s;everity by the in&s;olent
<PB N="78" REF="83">
terms in which he conveyed it. <Q REND="inline">"You (&s;aid he)&mdash;you, the &s;on of a ba&s;e me|chanic, who have dared to trample upon the nobles of Genoa&mdash;You, by their clemency, are only doomed to &s;hrink again into the nothing whence you &s;prung."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Uberto</HI> received his condemnation with re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the court; yet &s;tung by the manner in which it was expre&s;&s;ed, he could not forbear &s;aying to <HI>Adorno</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that perhaps he might hereafter find cau&s;e to repent the language he had u&s;ed to a man capable of &s;entiments as elevated as his own."</Q> He then made his obei&s;ance and retired; and, after taking leave of his friends, embarked in a ve&s;&s;el bound for Naples, and quitted his native country without a tear.</P>
<P>He collected &s;ome debts due to him in the Neapolitan dominions, and with the wreck of his fortune went to &s;ettle on one of the i&s;lands in the Archipe|lago
<PB N="79" REF="84">
belonging to the &s;tate of Venice. Here his indu&s;try and capacity in mer|cantile pur&s;uits rai&s;ed him in a cour&s;e of years to greater wealth than he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his mo&s;t pro&s;perous days at Genoa; and his reputation for ho|nour and genero&s;ity equalled his for|tune.</P>
<P>Among other places which he fre|quently vi&s;ited as a merchant, was the city of Tunis, at that time in friend|&s;hip with the Venetians, though ho&s;|tile to mo&s;t of the other Italian &s;tates, and e&s;pecially to Genoa. As <HI>Uberto</HI> was on a vi&s;it to one of the fir&s;t men of that place at his country hou&s;e, he &s;aw a young chri&s;tian &s;lave at work in irons, who&s;e appearance excited his atten|tion. The youth &s;eemed oppre&s;&s;ed with labour to which his delicate frame had not been accu&s;tomed, and while he leaned at intervals upon the in&s;tru|ment with which he was working, a &s;igh bur&s;t from his full heart, and a
<PB N="80" REF="85">
tear &s;tole down his cheek. <HI>Uberto</HI> eyed him with tender compa&s;&s;ion, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed him in Italian. The youth eagerly caught the &s;ounds of his native tongue, and replying to his enquiries, informed him he was a Genoe&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"And what is your name, young man? (&s;aid <HI>Uberto</HI>) You need not be afraid of confe&s;&s;ing to <HI>me</HI> your birth and condi|tion."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alas! (he an&s;wered) I fear my captors already &s;u&s;pect enough to demand a large ran&s;om. My father is indeed one of the fir&s;t men in Genoa. His name is <HI>Adorno,</HI> and I am his only &s;on."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Adorno!</HI>"</Q> <HI>Uberto</HI> checked him&s;elf from uttering more aloud, but to him&s;elf he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Thank heaven! then I &s;hall be nobly revenged."</Q></P>
<P>He took leave of the youth, and im|mediately went to enquire after the cor&s;air captain who claimed a right in young <HI>Adorno,</HI> and having found him, demanded the price of his ran&s;om.
<PB N="81" REF="86">
He learned that he was con&s;idered as a capture of value, and that le&s;s than two thou&s;and crowns would not be ac|cepted. <HI>Uberto</HI> paid the &s;um; and cau&s;ing his &s;ervant to follow him with a hor&s;e and a complete &s;uit of hand&s;ome apparel, he returned to the youth who was working as before, and told him he was free. With his own hands he took off his fetters, and helped him to change his die&s;s, and mount on hor&s;e|back. The youth was tempted to think it all a dream, and the flutter of emotion almo&s;t deprived him of the power of returning thanks to his ge|nerous benefactor. He was &s;oon, how|ever, convinced of the reality of his good fortune, by &s;haring the lodging and table of <HI>Uberto.</HI></P>
<P>After a &s;tay of &s;ome days at Tunis to di&s;patch the remainder of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, <HI>Uberto</HI> departed homewards, ac|companied by young <HI>Adorno,</HI> who by his plea&s;ing manners had highly in|gratiated
<PB N="82" REF="87">
him&s;elf with him. <HI>Uberto</HI> kept him &s;ome time at his hou&s;e, treating him with all the re&s;pect and affection he could have &s;hown for the &s;on of his deare&s;t friend. At length, having a &s;afe opportunity of &s;ending him to Genoa, he gave him a faithful &s;ervant for a conductor, fitted him out with every convenience, &s;lipped a pur&s;e of gold into one hand, and a letter into another, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear youth, I could with much plea&s;ure detain you longer in my humble man&s;ion, but I feel your impatience to revi&s;it your friends, and I am &s;en&s;ible that it would be cruelty to deprive them longer than nece&s;&s;ary of the joy they will receive in recover|ing you.

<PB N="83" REF="88">
will hope you will not forget me."</Q> <HI>Adorno</HI> poured out the effu&s;ions of a grateful and affectionate heart, and they parted with mutual tears and embraces.</P>
<P>The young man had a pro&s;perous voyage home; and the tran&s;port with which he was again beheld by his al|mo&s;t heart-broken parents may more ea&s;ily be conceived than de&s;cribed. After learning that he had been a captive in Tunis (for it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;hip in which he &s;ailed had foundered at &s;ea), <Q REND="inline">"And to whom,"</Q> (&s;aid old <HI>Adorno</HI>) <Q REND="inline">"am I indebted for the ine&s;timable benefit of re&s;toring you to my arms?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"This letter,"</Q> (&s;aid his &s;on) <Q REND="inline">"will inform you."</Q> He opened it, and read as follows.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE HEROISM.</HEAD>

<P>The fir&s;t was a ferocious &s;avage, go|verned by the pa&s;&s;ions of anger and revenge, in gratifying which he di&s;re|garded all impul&s;es of duty and hu|manity.

objects he reckoned the blood of mil|lions as of no account.

<P>You have probably heard &s;omething of Mr. Howard, the reformer of pri|&s;ons, to whom a monument is ju&s;t erected in St. Paul's church.

When he began to examine the &s;tate of pri&s;ons, &s;carcely

any in this country was free from a very fatal and infectious di&s;temper called the gaol-fever. Wherever he heard of it, he made a point of &s;eeing the poor &s;ufferers, and often went down into their dungeons when the keepers them|&s;elves would not accompany him. He travelled &s;everal times over almo&s;t the whole of Europe, and even into A&s;ia, in order to gain knowledge of the &s;tate of pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals, and point out means for le&s;&s;ening the cala|mities that prevail in them. He even went into countries where the plague was, that he might learn the be&s;t me|thods of treating that terrible conta|gious di&s;ea&s;e; and he voluntarily ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf to perform a &s;trict qua|rantine, as one &s;u&s;pected of having the infection of the plague, only that he might be thoroughly acquainted with the methods u&s;ed for prevention.

<P>COME, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Barlow</HI> to his boys, I have a new play for you. I will be the founder of a colony; and you &s;hall be people of different trades and pro|fe&s;&s;ions coming to offer your&s;elves to go with me. What are you, <HI>A?</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a farmer, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! Farming is the chief thing we have to depend upon, &s;o we cannot have too much of it. But you mu&s;t be a working-farmer, not a gentleman farmer. Labourers will be &s;carce among us, and every man mu&s;t put his own hand to the plough. There will be woods to clear, and mar&s;hes to drain, and a great deal of &s;tubborn work to do.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be ready to do my part, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I &s;hall entertain you willingly, and as many more of your profe&s;&s;ion as you can bring. You &s;hall have land enough, and uten&s;ils; and you may fall to work as &s;oon as you plea&s;e. Now for the next.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a miller, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very u&s;eful trade! The corn we grow mu&s;t be ground, or it will do us little good. But what will you do for a mill, my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e we mu&s;t make one, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but then you mu&s;t bring with you a mill-wright for the purpo&s;e. As for mill-&s;tones, we will take them out with us. Who is next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a carpenter, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary man that could offer! We &s;hall find you work enough, never fear. There will be hou&s;es to build, fences to make,
<PB N="93" REF="98">
and all kinds of wooden furniture to provide. But our timber is all grow|ing. You will have a deal of hard work to do in felling trees, and &s;awing planks, and &s;haping po&s;ts, and the like. You mu&s;t be a field carpenter as well as a hou&s;e carpenter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; then I engage you, but you had better bring two or three able hands along with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a black&s;mith, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent companion for the carpenter! We cannot do without either of you; &s;o you may bring your great bellows and anvil, and we will &s;et up a forge for you as &s;oon as we arrive. But, by the bye, we &s;hall want a ma|&s;on for that purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am one, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well. Though we may live in log hou&s;es at fir&s;t, we &s;hall want brick or &s;tone work for chimneys, and hearths, and ovens, &s;o there will
<PB N="94" REF="99">
be employment for a ma&s;on. But if you can make bricks and burn lime too, you will be &s;till more u&s;eful.</P>
</SP>

<P>I will try what I can do, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No man can do more. I engage you. Who is next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a &s;hoemaker, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;hoes we cannot well do without. But can you make them, like Eumaeus in the Ody&s;&s;ey, out of a raw hidel for I fear we &s;hall get no leather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I can dre&s;s hides, too.</P>

<P>Can you? Then you are a clever fellow; and I will have you, though I give you double wages.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;Though it will be &s;ome time before we want holiday &s;uits, yet we mu&s;t not go naked; &s;o there will be work for the taylor. But you are not above mending and botching, I hope, for we mu&s;t not mind patched clothes while we work in the woods.</P>

<P>Weaving is a very u&s;eful art, but I que&s;tion if we can find room for it in our colony for the pre&s;ent We &s;hall not grow either hemp or flax for &s;ome time to come, and it will be cheaper for us to import our cloth than to make it. In a few years, however, we may be very glad of you.</P>

<P>But I under&s;tand clock and watch-making, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is &s;omewhat more to our purpo&s;e, for we &s;hall want to know how time goes. But I doubt we can|not give you &s;ufficient encouragement

<P>Alas, what can we do with you? If you will &s;have our men's rough beards once a week, and crop their hair once a quarter, and be con|tent to help the carpenter or follow the plough the re&s;t of your time, we &s;hall reward you accordingly. But you will have no ladies and gentlemen to dre&s;s for a ball, or wigs to curl and powder for Sundays, I a&s;&s;ure you.

<P>Then, Sir, you are very welcome. Health is the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;|ings, and if you can give us that, you will be a valuable man indeed. But I hope you under&s;tand &s;urgery

<P>We are peaceable people, and I hope &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to fight. We mean hone&s;tly to purcha&s;e our land from the natives, and to be ju&s;t and fair in all our dealings with them. William Penn, the founder of
<PB N="99" REF="104">
Penn&s;ylvania, followed that plan; and when the Indians were at war with all the other European &s;ettlers, a per&s;on in a quaker's habit might pa&s;s through all their mo&s;t ferocious tribes without the lea&s;t injury. It is my intention, however, to make all my coloni&s;ts &s;oldiers, &s;o far as to be able to defend them&s;elves if attacked, and that being the ca&s;e, we &s;hall have no need of <HI>&s;oldiers by trade.</HI></P>

<P>As to maintenance, I expect to be able to kill game enough for my

<HEAD>THE TRAVELLED ANT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a garden enclo&s;ed with high brick walls, and laid out &s;ome|what in the old fa&s;hion. Under the walls were wide beds planted with flowers, garden-&s;tuff, and fruit-trees. Next to them was a broad gravel walk running round the garden; and the middle was laid out in gra&s;s-plots, and beds of flowers and &s;hrubs, with a fi&s;h-pond in the centre.</P>
<P>Near the root of one of the wall fruit-trees, a numerous colony of ants was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which had extended its &s;ubterraneous works over great part of the bed in its neighbourhood. One day, two of the inhabitants meeting in a gallery under ground, fell into the following conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Ha! my friend, (&s;aid the fir&s;t) is it
<PB N="102" REF="107">
you? I am glad to &s;ee you. Where have you been this long time? All your acquaintance have been in pain about you, le&s;t &s;ome accident &s;hould have befallen you.</P>
<P>Why, (replied the other) I am in|deed a &s;ort of &s;tranger, for you mu&s;t know I am but ju&s;t returned from a long journey.</P>
<P>A journey! whither, pray, and on what account?</P>
<P>A tour of mere curio&s;ity. I had long felt di&s;&s;atisfied with knowing &s;o little about this world of ours; &s;o, at length, I took a re&s;olution to explore it. And, I may now boa&s;t that I have gone round its utmo&s;t extremities, and that no con&s;iderable part of it has e&s;caped my re&s;earches.</P>
<P>Wonderful! What a traveller you have been, and what &s;ights you mu&s;t have &s;een!</P>
<P>Why, yes&mdash;I have &s;een more than
<PB N="103" REF="108">
mo&s;t ants, to be &s;ure; but it has been at the expence of &s;o much toil and danger, that I know not whether it was worth the pains.</P>
<P>Would you oblige me with &s;ome account of your adventures?</P>
<P>Willingly. I &s;et out, then, early one &s;un&s;hiny morning; and, after cro&s;&s;|ing our territory and the line of plan|tation by which it is bordered, I came upon a wide open plain, where, as far as the eye could reach, not a &s;ingle green thing was to be de&s;cried, but the hard &s;oil was every where covered with huge &s;tones, which made travel|ling equally painful to the eye and the feet. As I was toiling onwards, I heard a rumbling noi&s;e behind me, which became louder and louder. I looked back, and with the utmo&s;t hor|ror beheld a prodigious rolling moun|tain approaching me &s;o fa&s;t, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get out of the way. I threw my&s;elf flat on the ground be|hind
<PB N="104" REF="109">
a &s;tone, and lay expecting nothing but pre&s;ent death. The mountain &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed over me, and I continued, I know not how long, in a &s;tate of in&s;en|&s;ibility. When I recovered, I began to &s;tretch my limbs one by one, and to my &s;urpri&s;e found my&s;elf not in the lea&s;t injured; but the &s;tone be&s;ide me was almo&s;t buried in the earth by the cra&s;h!</P>
<P>What an e&s;cape!</P>
<P>A wonderful one, indeed. I journey|ed on over the de&s;art, and at length came to the end of it, and entered upon a wide green tract, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of tall, narrow, pointed leaves, which grew &s;o thick and entangled, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty I could make my way between them; and I &s;hould continually have lo&s;t my road, had I not taken care to keep the &s;un in view before me. When I had got near the middle of this region, I was &s;tartled with &s;ight huge four-legged
<PB N="105" REF="110">
mon&s;ter, with a yellow &s;peckled &s;kin, which took a flying leap directly over me. Somewhat further, before I was aware, I ran upon one of tho&s;e long, round, crawling creatures, with|out head, tail, or legs, which we &s;ome|times meet with under ground near our &s;ettlement. As &s;oon as he felt me upon him, he drew back into his hole &s;o &s;wiftly, that he was near drawing me in along with him. However, I jump|ed off, and proceeded on my way.</P>
<P>With much labour I got at la&s;t to the end of this perplexed tract, and came to an open &s;pace like that in which we live, in the mid&s;t of which grew trees &s;o tall that I could not &s;ee to their tops. Being hungry, I climb|ed up the fir&s;t I came to, in expecta|tion of finding &s;ome fruit; but after a weary &s;earch I returned empty. I tried &s;everal others with no better &s;uc|ce&s;s. There were, indeed, leaves and flowers in plenty, but nothing of which
<PB N="106" REF="111">
I could make a meal; &s;o that I might have been fami&s;hed, had I not found &s;ome &s;our har&s;h berries upon the ground, on which I made a poor repa&s;t. While I was doing this, a greater danger than any of the former befel me. One of tho&s;e two-legged feathered creatures which we often &s;ee to our co&s;t, jump|ed down from a bough, and picked up in his enormous beak the very berry on which I was &s;tanding. Luckily he did not &s;wallow it immediately, but flew up again with it to the tree; and in the mean time I di&s;engaged my&s;elf, and fell from a va&s;t height to the ground, but received no hurt.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed this plantation, and came to another entangled green, like the fir&s;t. After I had laboured through it, I came on a &s;udden to the &s;ide of a va&s;t glittering plain, the nature of which I could not po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s at. I walked along a fallen leaf which lay on the &s;ide, and coming to the farther
<PB N="107" REF="112">
edge of it, I was greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee another ant coming from below to meet me. I advanced to give him a fraternal embrace, but in&s;tead of what I expected, I met a cold yield|ing matter, in which I &s;hould have &s;unk, had I not &s;peedily turned about, and caught hold of the leaf, by which I drew my&s;elf up again. And now I found this great plain to con&s;i&s;t of that fluid which &s;ometimes falls from the &s;ky, and cau&s;es us &s;o much trouble by filling our holes.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood con&s;idering how to pro|ceed on my journey, a gentle breeze aro&s;e, which, before I was aware, car|ried the leaf I was upon away from the &s;olid land into this yielding fluid, which, however, bore it up, and me along with it. At fir&s;t, I was greatly alarmed, and ran round and round my leaf in order to find &s;ome way of get|ting back; but perceiving this to be impracticable, I re&s;igned my&s;elf to
<PB N="108" REF="113">
my fate, and even began to take &s;ome plea&s;ure in the ea&s;y motion by which I was borne forwards. But what new and wonderful forms of living crea|tures did I &s;ee inhabiting this liquid land! Bodies of prodigious bulk, co|vered with &s;hining &s;cales of various colours, &s;hot by me with va&s;t rapidity, and &s;ported a thou&s;and ways. They had large heads, and &s;taring eyes, tremendous wide mouths, but no legs; and they &s;eemed to be carried on by the action of &s;omewhat like &s;mall wings planted on various parts of their body, and e&s;pecially at the end of the tail, which continually waved about. Other &s;maller creatures, of a great va|riety of extraordinary forms, were moving through the clear fluid, or re&s;ting upon its &s;urface; and I &s;aw with terror numbers of them continu|ally &s;eized and &s;wallowed by the larger ones before mentioned.</P>
<P>When I had got near the middle,
<PB N="109" REF="114">
the &s;mooth &s;urface of this plain was all roughened and moved up and down, &s;o as to to&s;s about my leaf, and nearly over&s;et it. I trembled to think what would become of me &s;hould I be thrown amid&s;t all the&s;e terrible mon|&s;ters. At la&s;t, however, I got &s;afe to the other &s;ide, and with joy &s;et my feet on dry land again. I a&s;cended a gentle green &s;lope, which led to a tall plantation like that I had before pa&s;&s;ed through. Another green plain, and another &s;tony de&s;art, &s;ucceeded; which brought me at length to the oppo&s;ite boundary of our world, enclo&s;ed by the &s;ame immen&s;e mound ri&s;ing to the heavens, which limits us on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>Here I fell in with another nation of our &s;pecies, differing little in way of life from our&s;elves. They invited me to their &s;ettlement, and entertained me ho&s;pitably, and I accompanied them in &s;everal excur&s;ions in the neigh|bourhood. There was a charming fruit-tree
<PB N="110" REF="115">
at no great di&s;tance, to which we made frequent vi&s;its. One day, as I was regaling deliciou&s;ly in the heart of a green-gage plum, I felt my&s;elf all on a &s;udden carried along with great &s;wiftne&s;s, till I got into a dark place, where a horrid cra&s;h threw me upon a &s;oft moi&s;t piece of fle&s;h, whence I was &s;oon driven forth in a torrent of wind and moi&s;ture, and found my&s;elf on the ground all covered with &s;lime. I di&s;en|gaged my&s;elf with difficulty, and looking up, de&s;cried one of tho&s;e enormous two-legged animals, which often &s;hake the ground over our heads, and put us into terror.</P>
<P>My new friends now began to hint to me that it was time to depart, for you know we are not fond of natural|izing &s;trangers. And lucky, indeed, it was for me that I received the hint when I did; for I had but ju&s;t left the place, and was travelling over a neigh|bouring eminence, when I heard be|hind
<PB N="111" REF="116">
hind me a tremendous noi&s;e; and looking back, I &s;aw the whole of their &s;ettlement blown into the air with a prodigious explo&s;ion of fire and &s;moke. Numbers of half-burnt bodies, together with the ruins of their habitations, were thrown to a va&s;t di&s;tance around; and &s;uch a &s;uffocating vapour aro&s;e, that I lay for &s;ome time deprived of &s;en&s;e and motion. From &s;ome of the wretched fugitives I learned that the di&s;a&s;ter was attributed to &s;ubterranean fire bur&s;ting its way to the &s;urface; the cau&s;e of which, however, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be connected with the ma|chinations of that malignant two-leg|ged mon&s;ter from who&s;e jaws I had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped, who had been ob|&s;erved ju&s;t before the explo&s;ion to pour through the holes leading to the great apartment of the &s;ettlement, a num|ber of black &s;hining grains.</P>
<P>On my return from this remote country, I kept along the boundary
<PB N="112" REF="117">
wall, which I knew by ob&s;ervation mu&s;t at length bring me back to my own home. I met with &s;everal wan|dering tribes of our &s;pecies in my road, and frequently joined their foraging par|ties in &s;earch of food. One day, a company of us, allured by the &s;mell of &s;omewhat &s;weet, climbed up &s;ome lofty pillars, on which was placed a va&s;t round edifice, having only one entrance. At this were continually coming in and going out tho&s;e winged animals, &s;omewhat like our&s;elves in form, but many times bigger, and arm|ed with a dreadful &s;ting, which we &s;o often meet with &s;ipping the juices of flowers; but whether they were the architects of this great man&s;ion, or it was built for them by &s;ome beneficent being of greater powers, I am unable to decide. It &s;eemed, however, to be the place where they depo&s;ited what they &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly collect; for they were perpetually arriving loaded with a fra|grant
<PB N="113" REF="118">
&s;ub&s;tance, which they carried in, and they returned empty. We had a great de&s;ire to enter with them, but were deterred by their formidable ap|pearance, and a kind of angry hum which continually proceeded from the hou&s;e. At length, two or three of the bolde&s;t of our party, watching a time when the entrance was pretty free, ventured to go in; but we &s;oon &s;aw them driven out in great ha&s;te, and trampled down and ma&s;&s;acred ju&s;t in the gate-way. The re&s;t of us made a &s;peedy retreat.</P>
<P>Two more adventures which hap|pened to me, had very nearly pre|vented my return to my own country. Having one evening, together with a companion, taken up my quarters in an empty &s;nail-&s;hell, there came on &s;uch a &s;hower of rain in the night, that the &s;hell was pre&s;ently filled. I awaked ju&s;t &s;uffocated; but luckily, having my head turned towards the mouth of
<PB N="114" REF="119">
the &s;hell, I ro&s;e to the top, and made a &s;hift to crawl to a dry place. My companion, who had got further into the &s;hell, never ro&s;e again.</P>
<P>Not long after, as I was travelling under the wall, I de&s;cried a curious pit, with a circular orifice, gradually growing narrower to the bottom. On coming clo&s;e to the brink in order to &s;urvey it, the edge, which was of fine &s;and, gave way, and I &s;lid down the pit. As &s;oon as I had reached the bottom, a creature with a huge pair of horns and dreadful claws made his ap|pearance from beneath the &s;and, and attempted to &s;eize me. I flew back, and ran up the &s;ide of the pit; when he threw over me &s;uch a &s;hower of &s;and, as blinded me, and had like to have brought me down again. How|ever, by exerting all my &s;trength, I got out of his reach, and did not cea&s;e running till I was at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance. I was afterwards informed that
<PB N="115" REF="120">
this was the den of an ant-lion, a ter|rible foe of our &s;pecies, which not equalling us in &s;peed, is obliged to make u&s;e of this crafty device to en|trap his heedle&s;s prey.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t of my perils. To my great joy I reached my native place la&s;t night, where I mean to &s;tay con|tent for the future. I do not know how far I have benefited from my travels, but one important conclu&s;ion I have drawn from them.</P>
<P>What is that? (&s;aid his friend.)</P>
<P>Why, you know it is the current opinion with us, that every thing in this world was made for our u&s;e. Now, I have &s;een &s;uch va&s;t tracts not at all fit for our re&s;idence, and peopled with creatures &s;o much larger and &s;tronger than our&s;elves, that I cannot help be|ing convinced that the Creator had in view their accommodation as well as ours, in making this world.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s this &s;eems probable enough;
<PB N="116" REF="121">
but you had better keep your opinion to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>You know we ants are a vain race, and make high preten&s;ions to wi&s;dom as well as antiquity. We &s;hall be af|fronted with any attempts to le&s;&s;en our importance in our own eyes.</P>
<P>But there is no wi&s;dom in being de|ceived.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;do as you think proper. Meantime, farewell, and thanks for the entertainment you have given me.</P>
<P>Farewell!</P>

<HEAD>SHOW AND USE; OR, THE TWO PRESENTS.</HEAD>
<P>ONE morning, Lord Richmore, coming down to breakfa&s;t, was wel|comed with the tidings that his fa|vourite
<PB N="117" REF="122">
mare, Mi&s;s Slim, had brought a foal, and al&s;o, that a &s;he-a&s;s kept for his lady's u&s;e as a milker, had dropt a young one. His lord&s;hip &s;miled at the inequality of the pre&s;ents nature had made him. <Q REND="inline">"As for the foal (&s;aid he to the groom) that, you know, has been long promi&s;ed to my neighbour Mr. Scamper. For young Balaam, you may di&s;po&s;e of him as you plea&s;e."</Q> The groom thanked his lord&s;hip, and &s;aid he would then give him to I&s;aac the woodman.</P>
<P>In due time, Mi&s;s Slim's foal, which was the &s;on of a noted racer, was taken to Squire Scamper's, who received him with great delight, and out of compli|ment to the donor named him <HI>Young Peer.</HI> He was brought up with at lea&s;t as much care and tenderne&s;s as the Squire's own children&mdash;kept in a warm &s;table, fed with the be&s;t of corn and hay, duly dre&s;&s;ed, and regularly exerci&s;ed. As he grew up, he gave
<PB N="118" REF="123">
tokens of great beauty. His colour was bright bay, with a white &s;tar on his forehead; his coat was fine, and &s;hone like &s;ilk; and every point about him &s;eemed to promi&s;e perfection of &s;hape and make. Every body admired him as the complete&s;t colt that could be &s;een.</P>
<P>So fine a creature could not be de&s;|tined to any u&s;eful employment. Af|ter he had pa&s;&s;ed his third year, he was &s;ent to Newmarket to be trained for the turf, and a groom was appoint|ed to the care of him alone. His ma&s;ter, who could not well afford the expence, &s;aved part of it by turning off a dome&s;tic tutor whom he kept for the education of his &s;ons, and was content with &s;ending them to the cu|rate of the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>At four years old, Young Peer &s;tarted for a &s;ub&s;cription pur&s;e, and came in &s;econd out of a number of competitors. Soon after, he won a country plate, and filled his ma&s;ter
<PB N="119" REF="124">
with joy and triumph. The Squire now turned all his attention to the turf, made matches, betted high, and was at fir&s;t tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful. At length, having ventured all the money he could rai&s;e upon one grand match, Young Peer ran on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t, was di&s;tanced, and the &s;quire ruined.</P>
<P>Meantime young Balaam went into I&s;aac's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, where he had a very different training. He was left to pick up his living as he could in the lanes and commons; and on the colde&s;t days in winter he had no other &s;helter than the lee &s;ide of the cottage, out of which he was of|ten glad to pluck the thatch for a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. As &s;oon as ever he was able to bear a rider, I&s;aac's children got upon him, &s;ometimes two or three at once; and if he did not go to their mind, a broom&s;tick or bunch of furze was freely applied to his hide. Ne|verthele&s;s
<PB N="120" REF="125">
he grew up, as the children them&s;elves did, &s;trong and healthy; and though he was rather bare on the ribs, his &s;hape was good and his limbs vigorous.</P>
<P>It was not long before his ma&s;ter thought of putting him to &s;ome u&s;e; &s;o, taking him to the wood, he fa&s;ten|ed a load of faggots on his back, and &s;ent him with his &s;on Tom to the next town. Tom &s;old the faggots, and mounting upon Balaam, rode him home. As I&s;aac could get plenty of faggots and chips, he found it a pro|fitable trade to &s;end them for daily &s;ale upon Balaam's back. Having a little garden, which from the barren|ne&s;s of the &s;oil yielded him nothing of value, he bethought him of loading Balaam back from town with dung for manure. Though all he could bring at once was contained in two &s;mall panniers, yet this in time amount|ed to enough to mend the &s;oil of his
<PB N="121" REF="126">
whole garden, &s;o that he grew very good cabbages and potatoes, to the great relief of his family. I&s;aac, be|ing now &s;en&s;ible of the value of his a&s;s, began to treat him with more at|tention. He got a &s;mall &s;tack of ru&s;hy hay for his winter fodder, and with his own hands built him a little &s;hed of boughs and mud in order to &s;helter him from the bad weather. He would not &s;uffer any of his family to u&s;e Balaam ill, and after his daily journies he was allowed to ramble at plea&s;ure. He was now and then clean|ed and dre&s;&s;ed, and, upon the whole, made a reputable figure. I&s;aac took in more land from the wa&s;te, &s;o that by degrees he became a little farmer, and kept a hor&s;e and cart, a cow, and two or three pigs. This made him quite a rich man; but he had always the gratitude to impute his pro&s;perity to the good &s;ervices of Balaam, the
<PB N="122" REF="127">
groom's pre&s;ent; while the &s;quire cur&s;|ed Young Peer as the cau&s;e of his ruin, and many a time wi&s;hed that his lord|&s;hip had kept his dainty gift to him|&s;elf.</P>

<P>WELL, Charles, you &s;eem to be deep in meditation. Pray what are you thinking about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was thinking, Sir, how happy it is for us that we are not in the place of that poor weaver who&s;e cottage we ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very right to be &s;en|&s;ible of all the advantages that Provi|dence has be&s;towed on us in this world, and I commend you for reflecting on them with gratitude. But what par|ticular circum&s;tance of compari&s;on be|tween
<PB N="124" REF="129">
our condition and his &s;truck you mo&s;t ju&s;t now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, almo&s;t every thing! I could not bear to live in &s;uch a poor hou&s;e, with a cold clay floor, and half the windows &s;topt with paper. Then how poorly he and his children are dre&s;&s;ed! and I dare &s;ay they mu&s;t live as poorly too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e things would be grie|vous enough to you, I do not doubt, becau&s;e you have been accu&s;tomed to a very different way of living. But if they are healthy and contented, I don't know that <HI>we</HI> have much more to boa&s;t of. I believe the man is able to pro|cure whole&s;ome food for his family, and clothes and firing enough to keep them from &s;uffering from the cold; and nature wants little more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what a ragged barefooted &s;ellow the boy at the door was!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was&mdash;but did you ob|&s;erve his ruddy cheeks, and his &s;tout

legs, and the &s;miling grin upon his countenance? It is my opinion he would beat you in running, though he is half the head le&s;s; and I dare &s;ay he never cried becau&s;e he did not know what to do with him&s;elf, in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you have often told me that the mind is the noble&s;t part of man; and the&s;e poor creatures, I am &s;ure, can have no opportunity to improve their minds. They mu&s;t be as ignorant as the brutes, almo&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o? Do you think there is no knowledge to be got but from books; or that a weaver cannot teach his children right from wrong?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if he has never learned him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;but I hope the coun|try we live in is not &s;o unfriendly to a poor man as to afford him no opportu|nity of learning his duty to God and his neighbour. And as to other points of knowledge, nece&s;&s;ity and common
<PB N="126" REF="131">
ob&s;ervation will teach him a good deal. But come&mdash;let us go and pay them a vi&s;it, for I doubt you hardly think them human creatures.</P>

<P>It is, indeed. Here are &s;everal arts, you &s;ee, in this hou&s;e, which both you and I &s;hould be much puzzled to &s;et about. But there are &s;ome books too, I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a bible, and a te&s;ta|ment, and a prayer-book, and a &s;pell|ing-book, and and a volume of the gardener's dictionary.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how many of your fa|mily can read, my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>All the children but the two younge&s;t can read a little, Sir; but Meg, there, is the be&s;t &s;cholar among

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear that, Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Sir. Here's an alma|nack, too, again&s;t the wall; and here are my favourite ballads of the Chil|dren of the Wood, and Chevy-chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>I let the children pa&s;te them up, Sir, and a few more that have no harm in them. There's Hearts of Oak, and Rule Britannia, and Robin Gray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very good choice, in|deed. I &s;ee you have a pretty garden there behind the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>What beautiful &s;tocks and wall|flowers! We have none &s;o fine in our garden.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ma&s;ter, to &s;ay the truth, we are rather proud of them. I have got a way of cultivating them that I

<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here are &s;everal more plants that I never &s;aw before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of them are pot herbs, that we put into our broth or por|ridge; and other are phy&s;ic herbs, for we cannot afford to go to a doctor for every trifling ailment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how did you learn the u&s;e of the&s;e things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, partly, ma&s;ter, from an old herbal that I have got; and partly
<PB N="131" REF="136">
from my good mother and &s;ome old neighbours; for we poor people are obliged to help one another as well as we can.

<P>I am glad of it. You &s;ee, when we compare our&s;elves with this

weaver, all the advantage is not on our &s;ide. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an art, the utility of which &s;ecures him a liveli|hood whatever may be the changes of the times. All his family are brought up to indu&s;try, and &s;how no &s;mall in|genuity in their &s;everal occupations. They are not without in&s;truction, and e&s;pecially &s;eem to be in no want of that be&s;t of all, the knowledge of their duty. They under&s;tand &s;omething of the cultivation and u&s;es of plants, and are capable of receiving enjoyment from the beauties of nature. They partake of the plea&s;ures of home and neigh|bourhood. Above all, they &s;eem con|tent with their lot, and free from anxi|ous cares and repinings. I view them as truly re&s;pectable members of &s;ociety, acting well the part allotted to them, and that, a part mo&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of the whole. They may, from untoward accidents, be ren|dered

objects of our compa&s;&s;ion, but they never can of our contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am very far from de&s;pi&s;ing them now. But would it not be po&s;&s;ible to make them more com|fortable than they are at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it would; and when giving a little from the &s;uperfluities of per&s;ons in our &s;ituation, would add &s;o much to the happine&s;s of per&s;ons in theirs, I am of opinion that it is un|pardonable not to do it.

<P>And &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, we were to give him &s;ome good potatoes to plant it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. E.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will. Then, you know, we have a fine &s;ow that never fails to produce a numerous litter twice a year. Suppo&s;e we rear one of the next brood

<P>You may leave that to his own ingenuity; I warrant he can ma|nage &s;uch a job as that, with the help of a neighbour, at lea&s;t. Well&mdash;I hope both the weaver, and you, will be the better for the acquaintance we have made to day: and always remem|ber that, <HI>man, when fulfilling the duties of his &s;tation, be that &s;tation what it may, is a worthy object of re&s;pect to his fellow|man.</HI></P>

It would be ea&s;y to write over the door, in order to di&s;|tingui&s;h it, <Q REND="inline">"This is the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e;"</Q> but it is a more ingenious and elegant way of pointing it out, to place upon the building a figure repre&s;ent|ing the purpo&s;e for which it was erected, namely, to di&s;tribute <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> For this end, the notion of ju&s;tice is to be <HI>per&s;onified,</HI> that is, changed from an idea of the under&s;tanding into one of the &s;ight. A human figure is there|fore made, di&s;tingui&s;hed by tokens which bear a relation to the character of that virtue. Ju&s;tice carefully <HI>weighs</HI> both &s;ides of a cau&s;e; &s;he is therefore repre&s;ented as holding a <HI>pair of &s;cales.</HI> It is her office to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> crimes; &s;he therefore bears a <HI>&s;word.</HI> This is then
<PB N="138" REF="143">
an <HI>emblematical figure,</HI> and the &s;word and &s;cales are <HI>emblems.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand this very well. But why is &s;he blindfolded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>To denote her impartiality&mdash;that &s;he decides only from the merits of the ca&s;e, and not from a view of the parties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can &s;he weigh anything, though, when her eyes are blinded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well objected. The&s;e are two incon&s;i&s;tent emblems; each proper in it&s;elf, but when u&s;ed together, mak|ing a contradictory action. An arti&s;t of judgment will therefore drop one of them; and accordingly the be&s;t modern figures of Ju&s;tice have the balance and &s;word, without the bandage over the eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not there the &s;ame fault in making Cupid blindfolded, and yet putting a bow and arrow into his hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is. It is a gro&s;s ab&s;ur|dity,
<PB N="139" REF="144">
and not countenanced by the an|tient de&s;criptions of Cupid, who is re|pre&s;ented as the &s;ure&s;t of all archers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a figure of <HI>Death</HI> in my fable-book. I &s;uppo&s;e that is emble|matical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, or you could not know that it meant Death. How is he re|pre&s;ented?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is nothing but bones, and he holds a &s;cythe in one hand, and an hour-gla&s;s in the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;how do you interpret the&s;e emblems?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he is all bones, becau&s;e nothing but bones are left after a dead body has lain long in the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. This, however, is not &s;o properly an emblem, as the real and vi&s;ible effect of death. But the &s;cythe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that becau&s;e death mows down every thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. No in&s;trument could &s;o properly repre&s;ent the wide-wa&s;ting
<PB N="140" REF="145">
&s;way of death, which &s;weeps down the race of animals, like flowers falling under the hand of the mower. It is a &s;imile u&s;ed in the &s;criptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hour-gla&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, is to &s;how people that their time is come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. In the hour-gla&s;s that Death holds, all the &s;and is run out from the upper to the lower part. Have you never ob&s;erved upon a monument an old figure, with wings, and a &s;cythe, and with his head bald, all but a &s;ingle lock before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes!&mdash;and I have been told it is <HI>Time.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;and what do you make of it? Why is he old?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! becau&s;e time has la&s;ted a long while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why has he wings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e time is &s;wift, and flies away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does his &s;cythe mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that is, becau&s;e he de|&s;troys
<PB N="141" REF="146">
and cuts down every thing like death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. I think, however, a wea|pon rather &s;lower in its operation, as a pick-axe, would have been more &s;uitable to the gradual action of time. But what is his &s;ingle lock of hair for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been thinking, and can|not make it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought that would puzzle you. It relates to time as giving <HI>op|portunity</HI> for doing any thing. It is to be &s;eized as it pre&s;ents it&s;elf, or it will e&s;cape, and cannot be recover|ed. Thus the proverb &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Take time by the fore-lock."</Q> Well&mdash;now you under&s;tand what emblems are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think I do. I &s;uppo&s;e the painted &s;ugar-loaves over the grocer's &s;hop, and the mortar over the apothecary's, are emblems too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o properly. They are only the pictures of things which are them|&s;elves
<PB N="142" REF="147">
the objects of &s;ight, as the real &s;ugar-loaf in the &s;hop of the grocer, and the real mortar in that of the apothecary. However, an implement belonging to a particular rank or pro|fe&s;&s;ion, is commonly u&s;ed as an em|blem to point out the man exerci&s;ing that rank or profe&s;&s;ion. Thus a crown is con&s;idered as an emblem of a king; a &s;word or &s;pear, of a &s;oldier; an an|chor, of a &s;ailor; and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember Captain Heartwell, when he came to &s;ee us, had the figure of an anchor on all his buttons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had. That was the emblem or badge of his belonging to the navy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you told me that an emblem was a vi&s;ible &s;ign of an invi&s;ible thing; yet a &s;ea-captain is not an invi&s;ible thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not invi&s;ible as a man, but his profe&s;&s;ion is invi&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not well under&s;tand that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="148">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Profe&s;&s;ion is a <HI>quality,</HI> belong|ing equally to a number of individu|als, however different they may be in external form and appearance. It may be added or taken away without any vi&s;ible change. Thus, if Cap|tain Heartwell were to give up his commi&s;&s;ion, he would appear to you the &s;ame man as before. It is plain, therefore, that what in that ca&s;e he had lo&s;t, namely his profe&s;&s;ion, was a thing invi&s;ible. It is one of tho&s;e ideas of the under&s;tanding which I before mentioned to you, as different from a &s;en&s;ible idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend it now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have got here a few emblema|tical pictures. Suppo&s;e you try whe|ther you can find out their meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes&mdash;I &s;hould like that very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a man &s;tanding on the &s;ummit of a &s;teep cliff, and going to
<PB N="144" REF="149">
a&s;cend a ladder which he has planted again&s;t a cloud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee!&mdash;that mu&s;t be <HI>Am|bition,</HI> I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you explain it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is got very high already, but he wants to be &s;till higher; &s;o he ventures up the ladder, though it is only &s;upported by a cloud, and hangs over a precipice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very right. Here is now ano|ther man, hood-winked, who is cro&s;&s;|ing a raging torrent upon &s;tepping &s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he will certainly fall in. I &s;uppo&s;e he is one that runs into dan|ger without con&s;idering where he is going.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and you may call him <HI>Fool-hardine&s;s.</HI> Do you &s;ee this hand coming out of a black cloud, and put|ting an extingui&s;her upon a lamp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. If that lamp be the
<PB N="145" REF="150">
lamp of life, the hand that extingui&s;hes it, mu&s;t be <HI>Death.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very ju&s;t. Here is an old half|ruined building, &s;upported by props; and the figure of Time is &s;awing through one of the props.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t be <HI>Old-age,</HI> &s;urely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. The next is a man leaning upon a breaking crutch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't well know what to make of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is intended for <HI>In&s;tability;</HI> how|ever, it might al&s;o &s;tand for <HI>Fal&s;e Confidence.</HI> Here is a man poring over a &s;un-dial, with a candle in his hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s for that, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;ider&mdash;a &s;un-dial is only made to tell the hour by the light of the &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then this man mu&s;t know no|thing about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and his name is there|fore <HI>Ignorance.</HI> Here is a walking &s;tick, the lower-part of which is &s;et in
<PB N="146" REF="151">
the water, and it appears crooked. What does that denote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the &s;tick really crooked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but it is the property of water to give that appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it mu&s;t &s;ignify <HI>Deception.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does. I dare &s;ay you will at once know this fellow who is run|ning as fa&s;t as his legs will carry him, and looking back at his &s;hadow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>He mu&s;t be <HI>Fear,</HI> or <HI>Terror,</HI> I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; you may call him which you plea&s;e. But who is this &s;ower, that &s;catters &s;eed in the ground?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me con&s;ider. I think there is a parable in the Bible about &s;eed &s;own, and it there &s;ignifies &s;omething like <HI>In&s;truction.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but it may al&s;o repre&s;ent <HI>Hope,</HI> for no one would &s;ow without hoping to reap the fruit. What do you think of this candle held before a
<PB N="147" REF="152">
mirror, in which its figure is exactly reflected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know what it means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It repre&s;ents <HI>Truth;</HI> the e&s;&s;ence of which con&s;i&s;ts in the fidelity with which objects are received and reflect|ed back by our minds. The object is here a luminous one, to &s;how the clearne&s;s and brightne&s;s of Truth. Here is next an upright column, the perfect &s;traightne&s;s of which is &s;hown by a plumb line hanging from its &s;ummit, and exactly parallel to the &s;ide of the column.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that mu&s;t repre&s;ent <HI>Uprightne&s;s.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;or in other words, <HI>Rec|titude.</HI> The &s;trength and &s;tability of the pillar al&s;o denotes the &s;ecurity produced by this virtue. You &s;ee here a woman di&s;entangling and reeling off a very perplexed &s;kein of thread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>She mu&s;t have a great deal of patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="148" REF="153">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. She is <HI>Patience</HI> her&s;elf. The brooding hen &s;itting be&s;ide her is another emblem of the &s;ame quality that aids the interpretation. Who do you think this plea&s;ing female is, that looks with &s;uch kindne&s;s upon the drooping plant &s;he is watering?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t be <HI>Charity,</HI> I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; or you may call her <HI>Be|nignity,</HI> which is nearly the &s;ame thing. Here is a lady &s;itting demurely, with one finger on her lip, while &s;he holds a bridle in her other hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The finger on the lip I &s;uppo&s;e denotes Silence. The bridle mu&s;t mean Confinement. I could almo&s;t fancy her to be a School-mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! I hope, indeed, many &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are endued with her &s;pirit, for &s;he is <HI>Prudence,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;cretion.</HI> Well&mdash;we are now got to the end of our pictures, and upon the whole you have interpreted them very prettily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have one que&s;tion to a&s;k
<PB N="149" REF="154">
you, papa! In the&s;e pictures, and others that I have &s;een of the &s;ame &s;ort, almo&s;t all the <HI>good</HI> qualities are repre&s;ented in the form of <HI>women.</HI> What is the rea&s;on of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly a compliment, my dear, either to your &s;ex's per&s;on, or mind. The inventor either cho&s;e the figure of a female to cloath his agreeable quality in, becau&s;e he thought that the mo&s;t agreeable form, and therefore be&s;t &s;uited to it; or he meant to imply that the female character is really the mo&s;t virtuous and amiable. I rather believe that the fir&s;t was his intention, but I &s;hall not object to your taking it in the light of the &s;e|cond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it true&mdash;is it true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can give you very good authority for the preference of the fe|male &s;ex in a moral view. One Led|yard, a great traveller, who had walk|ed through almo&s;t all the countries of
<PB N="150" REF="155">
Europe, and at la&s;t died in an expe|dition to explore the internal parts of Africa, gave a mo&s;t deci&s;ive and plea&s;|ing te&s;timony in favour of the &s;uperior character of women, whether &s;avage or civilized. I was &s;o much plea&s;ed with it, that I put great part of it into ver&s;e; and if it will not make you vain, I will give you a copy of my lines.</P>
