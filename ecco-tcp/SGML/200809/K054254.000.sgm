<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON The <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of MATHEMATICAL LEARNING, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to hear from you, that the &s;tudy of the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> is Promoted and Encouraged among the <HI>Youth</HI> of your <HI>&V;niver&s;ity.</HI> The great influence, which the&s;e <HI>Sciences</HI> have on Philo&s;ophy and all u&s;eful Learning, as well as the Concerns of the Publick, may &s;ufficiently recommend them to your choice and con&s;ideration: and the particular advantages, which You of that place enjoy, give Us ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect from You a &s;uitable improve|ment in them. I have here &s;ent you &s;ome &s;hort reflections upon the <HI>&V;&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Mathematical Learning,</HI> which may &s;erve as an argument to incite you to a clo&s;er and more vigorous pur&s;uit of it.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
In all Ages and Countries, where Learning hath prevailed, the <HI>Mathe|matical Sciences</HI> have been looked upon as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of it. The very name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> implies no le&s;s; by which they were called either for their excellency, or becau&s;e of all the <HI>Sciences</HI> they were fir&s;t taught, or becau&s;e they were judg'd to comprehend <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. And among&s;t tho&s;e, that are commonly reckoned to be the &s;even Li|beral Arts, four are Mathematical, to wit, <HI>Arithmetick, Mu&s;ick, Geometry,</HI> and <HI>A&s;tronomy.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding their Excellency and Reputation, they have not been taught nor &s;tudy'd &s;o univer&s;ally, as &s;ome of the re&s;t; which I take to have pro|ceeded from the following cau&s;es: The <HI>aver&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of Mankind to &s;erious attention and clo&s;e arguing;</HI> Their <HI>not comprehending &s;ufficiently the nece&s;&s;ity or great u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e in other parts of Learning;</HI> An <HI>Opinion that this &s;tudy re|quires a particular Genius and turn of Head, which few are &s;o happy as to be Born with;</HI> And <HI>the want of Publick Encouragement, and able Ma&s;ters.</HI> For the&s;e, and perhaps &s;ome other rea&s;ons, this &s;tudy hath been
<PB N="3" REF="6">
generally neglected, and regarded only by &s;ome few per&s;ons, who&s;e happy Ge|nius and Curio&s;ity have prompted them to it, or who have been forced upon it by its immediate &s;ub&s;erviency to &s;ome particular Art or Office.</P>
<P>Therefore I think I cannot do better &s;ervice to Learning, Youth, and the Na|tion in general, than by &s;hewing, <HI>That the Mathematicks of all parts of humane know|ledge, for the improvement of the Mind, for their &s;ub&s;erviency to other Arts, and their u&s;e|fulne&s;s to the Common-wealth, de&s;erve mo&s;t to be encouraged.</HI> I know a di&s;cour&s;e of this nature will be offen&s;ive to &s;ome, who, while they are ignorant of Mathe|maticks, yet think them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all valuable Learning: but their di&s;|plea&s;ure mu&s;t not deterr me from de|livering an u&s;eful truth.</P>
<P>The advantages, which accrue to the Mind by <HI>Mathematical</HI> &s;tudies, con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the&s;e things: <HI>1&s;t.</HI> In accu&s;tom|ing it to <HI>attention. 2dly.</HI> In giving it a ha|bit of <HI>clo&s;e</HI> and <HI>demon&s;trative rea&s;oning. 3dly.</HI> In freeing it from <HI>prejudice, credu|lity,</HI> and <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Mathematicks make the Mind attentive to the objects, which it
<PB N="4" REF="7">
con&s;iders. This they do by entertaining it with a great variety of truths, which are delightful and evident, but not ob|vious. Truth is the &s;ame thing to the under&s;tanding, as Mu&s;ick to the ear, and Beauty to the eye. The pur&s;uit of it does really as much gratifie a natural faculty implanted in us by our wi&s;e Creator, as the plea&s;ing of our Sen&s;es: only in the former ca&s;e, as the Object and Faculty are more Spiritual, the de|light is the more pure, free from the re|gret, turpitude, la&s;&s;itude, and intempe|rance, that commonly attend &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures. The mo&s;t part of other <HI>Sci|ences</HI> con&s;i&s;ting only of probable rea|&s;onings, the Mind has not where to fix; and wanting &s;ufficient principles to pur|&s;ue its &s;earches upon, gives them over as impo&s;&s;ible. Again, as in <HI>Mathematical inve&s;tigations</HI> truth may be found, &s;o it is not always <HI>obvious:</HI> This &s;purs the Mind, and makes it diligent and atten|tive. <HI>In Geometria</HI> &s;ays Quinctilian, (lib. I. cap. 10.) <HI>partem fatentur e&s;&s;e utilem te|neris aetatibus: agitari namque animos, atque acui ingenia, &amp; celeritatem percipiendi ve|nire inde concedunt.</HI> And <HI>Plato</HI> (in <HI>Repub. lib.</HI> VII.) ob&s;erves, that the Youth, who
<PB N="5" REF="8">
are furni&s;hed with <HI>Mathematical</HI> know|ledge, are prompt and quick at all other <HI>Sciences,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. Therefore he calls it <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. And indeed Youth is generally &s;o much more delighted with <HI>Mathematical</HI> &s;tudies, than with the unplea&s;ant tasks, that are &s;ome times impo&s;ed upon them, that I have known &s;ome reclaimed by them from idlene&s;s and neglect of learn|ing, and acquire in time a habit of thinking, diligence, and attention; qua|lities, which we ought to &s;tudy by all means to beget in their de&s;ultory and roving Minds.</P>
<P>The &s;econd advantage, which the Mind reaps from <HI>Mathematical</HI> knowledge, is a habit of <HI>clear, demon&s;trative,</HI> and <HI>metho|dical</HI> Rea&s;oning. We are contriv'd by Nature to learn by Imitation more than by Precept: And I believe in that re|&s;pect Rea&s;oning is much like other in|feriour Arts (as <HI>Dancing, Singing,</HI> &amp;c.) acquired by practice. By accu&s;toming our &s;elves to Rea&s;on clo&s;ely about quan|tity, we acquire a habit of doing &s;o in other things. It is &s;urprizing to &s;ee, what &s;uperficial, incon&s;equential Rea|&s;onings, &s;atisfie the mo&s;t part of Man|kind.
<PB N="6" REF="9">
A piece of wit, a je&s;t, a &s;imile, or a quotation of an Author, pa&s;&s;es for a mighty Argument: with &s;uch things as the&s;e are the mo&s;t part of Authors &s;tuffed: and from the&s;e weighty pre|mi&s;es they infer their conclu&s;ions. This weakne&s;s and effeminacy of Mankind in being per&s;waded where they are delight|ed, have made them the &s;port of Ora|tors, Poets, and Men of wit. Tho&s;e <HI>lu|mina Orationis</HI> are indeed very good di|ver&s;ion for the Fancy, but are not the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the Under&s;tanding; and where a Man pretends to write on ab&s;tract &s;ubjects in a Scientifical method, he ought not to debauch in them. Lo|gical precepts are more u&s;eful, nay, they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a rule of formal arguing in publick di&s;putations, and confounding an ob&s;tinate and per|ver&s;e adver&s;ary, and expo&s;ing him to the audience, or readers. But in the &s;earch of truth, an imitation of the me|thod of the <HI>Geometers</HI> will carry a Man further than all the <HI>Dialectical</HI> rules. Their <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> is the proper model we ought to form our &s;elves upon, and imi|tate in the regular di&s;po&s;ition and gra|dual progre&s;s of our enquiries; and even
<PB N="7" REF="10">
he, who is ignorant of the nature of <HI>Ma|thematical Analy&s;is,</HI> u&s;es a method &s;ome|what Analogous to it. The <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of the <HI>Geometers,</HI> or their method of de|mon&s;trating truths already found out, viz. <HI>by Definitions of words agreed upon, by Self-evident truths, and Propo&s;itions that have been already demon&s;trated,</HI> is practicable in other &s;ubjects, tho' not to the &s;ame perfection, the natural want of evidence in the things them&s;elves not allowing it; but it is imitable to a con&s;iderable degree. I dare appeal to &s;ome writings of our own Age and Nation, the Au|thors of which have been Mathematically inclined. I &s;hall add no more on this head, but that one, who is accu&s;tomed to the methodical Sy&s;tems of truths, which the <HI>Geometers</HI> have reared up in the &s;e|veral branches of tho&s;e <HI>Sciences,</HI> which they have cultivated, will hardly bear with the confu&s;ion and di&s;order of other <HI>Sciences,</HI> but endeavour as far as he can to reform them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Mathematical</HI> knowledge adds a manly vigour to the Mind, frees it from <HI>prejudice, credulity,</HI> and <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI> This it does two ways, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> by accu&s;tom|ing us to examine, and not to take things
<PB N="8" REF="11">
upon tru&s;t. <HI>2dly.</HI> By giving us a clear and exten&s;ive knowledge of the Sy&s;tem of the World; which, as it creates in us the mo&s;t profound reverence of the Al|mighty and wi&s;e Creator; &s;o it frees us from the mean and narrow thoughts, which ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition are apt to beget. How great an enemy <HI>Mathe|maticks</HI> are to &s;uper&s;tition, appears from this, That in tho&s;e Countries, where <HI>Ro|mi&s;h Prie&s;ts</HI> exerci&s;e their barbarous Ty|ranny over the minds of Men, <HI>A&s;trono|mers,</HI> who are fully per&s;waded of the mo|tion of the Earth, dare not &s;peak out: But tho the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> may extort a Re|cantation, the Pope and a general Coun|cil too will not find them&s;elves able to per&s;wade to the contrary Opinion. Per|haps, this may have given occa&s;ion to a calumnious &s;ugge&s;tion, as if <HI>Mathematicks</HI> were an enemy to Religion, which is a &s;candal thrown both on the one and the other; for truth can never be an enemy to true Religion, which appears always to the be&s;t advantage, when it is mo&s;t examined.
<Q><L>&mdash;Si propi&ugrave;s &s;tes,</L>
<L>Te capiet magis.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> are
<PB N="9" REF="12">
friends to Religion; ina&s;much as they charm the pa&s;&s;ions, re&s;train the impetu|o&s;ity of imagination, and purge the Mind from error and prejudice. Vice is error, confu&s;ion and fal&s;e Rea&s;oning; and all truth is more or le&s;s oppo&s;ite to it. Be|&s;ides, <HI>Mathematical</HI> &s;tudies may &s;erve for a plea&s;ant entertainment for tho&s;e hours, which young Men are apt to throw away upon their Vices; the delightfulne&s;s of them being &s;uch, as to make &s;olitude not only ea&s;y, but de&s;irable.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid may &s;erve to recom|mend <HI>Mathematicks</HI> for acquiring a vi|gorous Con&s;titution of Mind; for which purpo&s;e they are as u&s;eful, as exerci&s;e is for procuring Health and Strength to the Body. I proceed now to &s;hew their va&s;t extent and U&s;efulne&s;s in other parts of knowledge. And here it might &s;uffice to tell you, that <HI>Mathematicks</HI> is the <HI>Sci|ence</HI> of quantity, or the <HI>Art</HI> of Rea&s;on|ing about things that are capable of <HI>more</HI> and <HI>le&s;s,</HI> and that the mo&s;t part of the ob|jects of our knowledge are &s;uch: as mat|ter, &s;pace, number, time, motion, gra|vity, &amp;c. We have but imperfect ideas of things without quantity, and as im|perfect a one of quantity it &s;elf without
<PB N="10" REF="13">
the help of <HI>Mathematicks.</HI> All the vi|&s;ible works of God Almighty are made in <HI>number, weight,</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ure;</HI> therefore to con&s;ider them, we ought to under|&s;tand <HI>Arithmetick, Geometry,</HI> and <HI>Staticks:</HI> and the greater advances we make in tho&s;e Arts, the more capable we are of con&s;idering &s;uch things, as are the ordi|nary objects of our Conceptions. But this will farther appear from particulars.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if we con&s;ider, to what per|fection we now know the Cour&s;es, Pe|riods, Order, Di&s;tances, and Proportions of the &s;everal great Bodies of the Uni|ver&s;e, at lea&s;t &s;uch as fall within our view; we &s;hall have cau&s;e to admire the Sagacity and Indu&s;try of the <HI>Mathema|ticians,</HI> and the power of <HI>Numbers</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI> well apply'd. Let us ca&s;t our Eyes backward, and con&s;ider <HI>A&s;tronomy</HI> in its Infancy: or rather let us &s;uppo&s;e it &s;till to begin; for in&s;tance, a Colony of Rude Country people, tran&s;planted into an I&s;land remote from the commerce of all Mankind, without &s;o much as the know|ledge of the Kalendar, and the Periods of the Sea&s;ons, without In&s;truments to make Ob&s;ervations, or any the lea&s;t notion of Ob&s;ervations or In&s;truments. When is it,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
we could expect any of their po&s;terity &s;hould arrive at the Art of predicting an Eclip&s;e? Not only &s;o, but the Art of reckoning all Eclip&s;es that are pa&s;t or to come, for any number of Years? When is it, we could &s;uppo&s;e, that one of tho&s;e I&s;landers tran&s;ported to any other place of the Earth, &s;hould be able by the in|&s;pection of the Heavens to find how much he were South or North, Ea&s;t or We&s;t of his own I&s;land, and to conduct his Ship back thither? For my part, tho' I know this may be, and is daily done, by what is known in <HI>A&s;tronomy;</HI> yet when I con|&s;ider the va&s;t Indu&s;try, Sagacity, multi|tude of Ob&s;ervations, and other extrin|&s;ick things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a &s;ublime piece of knowledge, I &s;hould be apt to pronounce it impo&s;&s;ible, and never to be hoped for. Now we are let &s;o much in|to the knowledge of the Machine of the Univer&s;e, and motion of its parts by the Rules of this <HI>Science,</HI> perhaps the inven|tion may &s;eem ea&s;y. But when we re|flect, what Penetration and Contrivance were nece&s;&s;ary to lay the foundations of &s;o great and exten&s;ive an Art, we cannot but admire its fir&s;t Inventors: as <HI>Thales Mile&s;ius,</HI> who, as <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> and
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ay, fir&s;t predicted Eclip&s;es; and his Scholar <HI>Anaximander Mile&s;ius,</HI> who found out the Globous Figure of the Earth, the Aequinoctial Points, the Obli|quity of the Ecliptick, the principles of Gnomonicks, and made the fir&s;t Sphere or Image of the Heavens; and <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> to whom we owe the di&s;covery of the true Sy&s;tem of the World, and order of the Planets. Tho' it may be, they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans.</HI> But whoever they were, that fir&s;t made the&s;e bold &s;teps in this Noble Art, they de&s;erve the prai&s;e and admiration of all future Ages.<Q><L>Felices animae, quibus haec cogno&s;cere primis,</L>
<L>Inque domos &s;uperas &s;candere cura fuit.</L>
<L>Credibile e&s;t illos pariter vitii&s;que joci&s;que</L>
<L>Altius humanis ex&s;erui&s;&s;e caput.</L>
<L>Non Venus &amp; vinum &s;ublimia pectora fregit,</L>
<L>Officiumque fori, militiaeque labor.</L>
<L>Non levis ambitio, perfu&s;aque gloria fuco,</L>
<L>Magnarumque fames &s;ollicitavit opum.</L>
<L>Admovere oculis di&s;tantia &s;idera no&s;tris,</L>
<L>Aetheraque ingenio &s;uppo&s;uere &s;uo.</L><BIBL>Ovid. in I^o. Fa&s;t.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But tho' the indu&s;try of former Ages had di&s;covered the Periods of the great
<PB N="13" REF="16">
Bodies of the Univer&s;e, and the true Sy&s;tem and Order of them, and their Orbits pretty near; yet was there one thing &s;till re&s;erved for the glory of this Age, and the honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h Na|tion,</HI> The grand &s;ecret of the whole Ma|chine; which, now it is di&s;covered, proves to be (like the other contrivances of In|finite Wi&s;dom) &s;imple and natural, de|pending upon the mo&s;t known and mo&s;t common property of matter, viz. <HI>gravity.</HI> From this the incomparable M^r. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated the Theories of all the Bodies of the Solar Sy&s;tem, of all the primary Planets and their &s;econdaries, and among others, the Moon, which &s;eem'd mo&s;t aver&s;e to numbers: And not only of the Planets, the &s;lowe&s;t of which compleats its Period in le&s;s than half the Age of a Man, but likewi&s;e of the Co|mets, &s;ome of which its probable &s;pend more than 2000. years in one Revolution about the Sun; for who&s;e Theory he has laid &s;uch a foundation, that after Ages a&s;&s;i&s;ted with more Ob&s;ervations, may be able to Calculate their returns. In a word, the prece&s;&s;ion of the Aequinoctial Points, the Tydes, the unequal Vibration of Pendulous Bodies in different Lati|tudes,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
&amp;c. are no more a que&s;tion to tho&s;e, that have <HI>Geometry</HI> enough to under&s;tand, what he has delivered on tho&s;e Subjects: A perfection in <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> that the bolde&s;t thinker dur&s;t hardly have hoped for; and, unle&s;s Mankind turn barbarous, will continue the Reputation of this Nation, as long as the Fabrick of Nature &s;hall en|dure. After this, what is it, we may not expect from <HI>Geometry</HI> join'd to <HI>Ob&s;ervati|ons</HI> and <HI>Experiments?</HI></P>
<P>The next con&s;iderable object of Na|tural knowledge, I take to be <HI>Light.</HI> How un&s;ucce&s;sful enquiries are about this Glorious Body without the help of <HI>Geometry,</HI> may appear from the empty and frivolous di&s;cour&s;es and di&s;putations of a &s;ort of Men, that call them&s;elves <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophers;</HI> whom nothing will &s;erve for|&s;ooth, but the knowledge of the very Nature, and intimate Cau&s;es of every thing: while on the other hand, the <HI>Geometers</HI> not troubling them&s;elves with tho&s;e fruitle&s;s enquiries about the <HI>Na|ture</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> have di&s;covered two re|markable properties of it, in the refle|ction and refraction of its beams: and from tho&s;e, and their &s;treightne&s;s in other ca&s;es, have invented the noble
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Arts of <HI>Opticks, Catoptricks,</HI> and <HI>Dioptricks;</HI> teaching us to manage this &s;ubtile Body for the improvement of our knowledge, and u&s;eful purpo&s;es of Life. They have likewi&s;e demon&s;trated the cau&s;es of &s;e|veral Coele&s;tial appearances, that ari&s;e from the inflection of its Beams, both in the Heavenly Bodies them&s;elves and other Phoenomena, as <HI>Parhelia,</HI> the <HI>Iris,</HI> &amp;c. and by a late Experiment they have di&s;covered the celerity of its motion. And we &s;hall know yet more &s;urprizing properties of <HI>Light,</HI> when M^r. <HI>Newton</HI> &s;hall be pleas'd to gratifie the World with his <HI>Book of Light and Colours.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fluids</HI> which involve our Earth, viz. <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> are the next great and con&s;picuous Bodies, that Nature pre|&s;ents to our view: And I think we know little of either, but what is owing to <HI>Mechanicks</HI> and <HI>Geometry.</HI> The two chiefe&s;t properties of <HI>Air,</HI> its Gravity and Ela&s;tick force, have been di&s;covered by Mechanical Experiments. From thence the decrea&s;e of the Air's den&s;ity according to the increa&s;e of the di&s;tance of the Earth has been demon&s;trated by <HI>Geometers,</HI> and confirmed by Experiments of the &s;ub&s;idence of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<HI>Torricellian Experiment.</HI> From this like|wi&s;e, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Geometry,</HI> they have determined the height of the Atmo|&s;phere, as far as it has any &s;en&s;ible den|&s;ity; which agrees exactly with another Ob&s;ervation of the duration of the Twi|light. <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> make up the object of the <HI>Hydro&s;taticks,</HI> tho' denominated only from the latter, of which the prin|ciples were long &s;ince &s;ettled and demon|&s;trated by <HI>Archimedes,</HI> in his Book <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, where are demon&s;trated the cau&s;es of &s;everal &s;urprizing Phoenomena of Nature, depending only on the <HI>Aequi|librium</HI> of <HI>Fluids,</HI> the relative Gravities of the&s;e <HI>Fluids,</HI> and of Solids &s;wimming or &s;inking therein. Here al&s;o the Ma|thematicians con&s;ider the different Pre&s;|&s;ures, Re&s;i&s;tances, and Celerities of So|lids moved in Fluids: from whence they explain a great many appearances of Nature, unintelligible to tho&s;e who are ignorant of <HI>Geometry.</HI></P>
<P>Next, if we de&s;cend to the <HI>Animal Kingdom,</HI> there we may &s;ee the brighte&s;t &s;trokes of Divine Mechanicks. And whi|ther we con&s;ider fir&s;t the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> in general, either in the internal motion and circulation of the Juices forced
<PB N="17" REF="20">

to treat of it. Nay, notwith&s;tanding the full di&s;covery of it, &s;ome go on in co|pying their Predece&s;&s;ors, and talk as <HI>&V;n|geometrically</HI> as ever. It's true, we can|not rea&s;on &s;o clearly of the internal mo|tions of an Animal Body, as of the ex|ternal, wanting &s;ufficient <HI>data</HI> and de|ci&s;ive Experiments: But what relates to the latter (as the Articulation, Structure, In&s;ertion, and <HI>Vires</HI> of the Mu&s;cles) is as &s;ubject to &s;trict Mathematical di&s;qui&s;i|tion, as any thing what&s;oever; and even in the Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es and their Cures, tho&s;e, who talk Mechanically, talk mo&s;t intelligibly. Which may be the rea&s;on for the Opinion of the ancient Phy&s;icians, that Mathematicks are nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;tudy of Medicine it &s;elf, for which I could bring long quotations out of their works.

<P>The u&s;efulne&s;s of <HI>Mathematicks</HI> in &s;e|veral other Arts and Sciences is fully as plain. They were looked upon by the ancient Philo&s;ophers as the key to all knowledge. Therefore <HI>Plato</HI> wrote upon

<P>Every body knows, that <HI>Chronology</HI> and <HI>Geography</HI> are indi&s;pen&s;able preparations for Hi&s;tory: a relation of matter of fact being a very lifele&s;s in&s;ipid thing with|out the circum&s;tances of time and place.

<P>No body, I think, will que&s;tion the in|tere&s;t, that Mathematicks have in <HI>Paint|ing, Mu&s;ick,</HI> and <HI>Architecture,</HI> which are all founded on numbers.

For by Per&s;pective, may be under&s;tood the Art of de&s;igning the outlines of your &s;olid, whether that be a Building, Land|skip, or Animal: and the draught of a Man is really as much the Per&s;pective of a Man, as the draught of a Building is of a Building; tho' for particular rea&s;ons, as becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of more crooked lines, &amp;c. it is hard to reduce the Per&s;pe|ctive of the former, to the ordinary e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Rules.</P>
<P>If <HI>Mathematicks</HI> had not reduced <HI>Mu|&s;ick</HI> to a regular Sy&s;tem, by contriving its <HI>Scales,</HI> it had been no Art, but Enthu&s;i|a&s;tick
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Rapture, left to the roving fancy of every Practitioner. This appears by the extraordinary pains, which the Anci|ents have taken to fit numbers to three &s;orts of Mu&s;ick, the <HI>Diatonick, Chroma|tick,</HI> and <HI>Enharmonick:</HI> which if we con|&s;ider with their nicety in di&s;tingui&s;hing their &s;everal <HI>Modes,</HI> we &s;hall be apt to judge, they had &s;omething very fine in their <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> at lea&s;t for moving the pa&s;|&s;ions with &s;ingle In&s;truments and Voices.

<P>I proceed now to &s;hew the more im|mediate u&s;efulne&s;s of <HI>Mathematicks</HI> in <HI>Civil Affairs.</HI> To begin with <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> it were an endle&s;s task to relate its &s;eve|ral u&s;es in publick and private bu&s;ine&s;s. The regulation and quick di&s;patch of both, &s;eem intirely owing to it. The Nations, that want it, are altogether bar|barous, as &s;ome <HI>Americans,</HI> who can hardly reckon above twenty. And I be|lieve it would go near to ruine the Trade of the Nation, were the ea&s;y practice of <HI>Arithmetick</HI> aboli&s;hed: for example, were the Merchants and Trade&s;men oblig'd to make u&s;e of no other than the <HI>Roman</HI> way of notation by Letters, in&s;tead of our pre&s;ent. And if we &s;hould feel the
<PB N="28" REF="31">
want of our <HI>Arithmetick</HI> in the ea&s;ie&s;t Calculations, how much more in tho&s;e, that are &s;ome thing harder; as Intere&s;t &s;imple and compound, Annuities, &amp;c. in which, it is incredible, how much the or|dinary Rules and Tables influence the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Arithmetick</HI> is not only the great In&s;trument of private Commerce, but by it are (or ought to be) kept the publick Accounts of a Na|tion: I mean tho&s;e, that regard the whole State of a Common-wealth, as to the number, fructification of its people, in|crea&s;e of Stock, improvement of Lands and Manufactures, Ballance of Trade, Publick Revenues, Coynage, Military power by Sea and Land, &amp;c. Tho&s;e, that would judge or rea&s;on truely about the State of any Nation, mu&s;t go that way to work, &s;ubjecting all the fore-menti|oned particulars to Calculation. This is the true <HI>Political</HI> knowledge. In this re&s;pect the affairs of a Common-wealth differ from tho&s;e of a private Family, only in the greatne&s;s and multitude of particulars, that make up the accounts. <HI>Machiavel</HI> goes this way to work in his account of different E&s;tates. What Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> and &s;everal others of our
<PB N="29" REF="32">
Country-men have wrote in <HI>Political Arithmetick,</HI> does abundantly &s;hew the plea&s;ure and u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;uch Specula|tions. It is true, for want of good infor|mation, their Calculations &s;ome times proceed upon erroneous &s;uppo&s;itions: but that is not the fault of the Art. But what is it, the Government could not perform in this way, who have the com|mand of all publick Records?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Numbers are applicable even to &s;uch things, as &s;eem to be govern'd by no rule, I mean &s;uch as depend on <HI>Chance:</HI> The quantity of probability and propor|tion of it in any two propo&s;ed ca&s;es being &s;ubject to Calculation as much as any thing el&s;e. Upon this depend the princi|ples of Game. We find Sharpers know enough of this, to cheat &s;ome men that would take it very ill to be thought Bub|bles: And one Game&s;ter exceeds another, as he has a greater &s;agacity and readine&s;s in Calculating his probability to win or lo&s;e in any propo&s;ed ca&s;e. To under|&s;tand the Theory of <HI>Chance</HI> throughly, requires a great knowledge of Numbers, and a pretty competent one of <HI>Algebra.</HI></P>

For by the&s;e we are able in our Clo&s;et to judge of the Cele&s;tial mo|tions, and to vi&s;it the mo&s;t di&s;tant places of the Earth, without the fatigue and danger of Voyages; to determine con|cerning their di&s;tance, Situation, Climate, Nature of the Sea&s;ons, length of their days, and their relation to the Cele&s;tial Bodies, as much as if we were Inhabi|tants. To all the&s;e I might add tho&s;e In&s;truments, which the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> have invented to execute their own pre|cepts, for making <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> either at Sea or Land, <HI>Surveying, Gauging,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catoptricks</HI> and <HI>Dioptricks</HI> furni&s;h us with variety of u&s;eful inventions, both for the promoting of knowledge, and the conveniencies of Life; whereby Sight, the great In&s;trument of our per|ception, is &s;o much improv'd, that nei|ther the di&s;tance, nor the minutene&s;s of the Object are any more impediments to it.

from us. How much have we learned by the help of the <HI>Micro&s;cope</HI> of the contrivance and &s;tructure of Animal and Vegetable Bodies, and the compo&s;ition of Fluids and Solids? But if the&s;e <HI>Sci|ences</HI> had never gone further, than by their &s;ingle <HI>Specula</HI> and <HI>Lentes</HI> to give tho&s;e &s;urprizing appearances of Objects and their Images, and to produce heat unimitable by our hotte&s;t Furnaces, and to furni&s;h infallible, ea&s;y, cheap, and &s;afe remedies for the decay of our Sight ari&s;ing commonly from old Age, and for purblindne&s;s; they had merited the great|e&s;t e&s;teem, and invited to the clo&s;e&s;t &s;tudy: e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that &s;uch as na|turally are almo&s;t blind, and either know not their neare&s;t acquaintance at the di&s;tance of a rooms breadth, or cannot read in order to pa&s;s their time plea&s;ant|ly, are by Gla&s;&s;es adapted to the defect of their Eyes &s;et on a level again with tho&s;e that enjoy their Eye-&s;ight be&s;t, and that without danger, pain, or charge.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Mathematicks</HI> are highly &s;ervice|able to a Nation in <HI>Military Affairs.</HI> I believe this will be readily acknowledg'd by every body. The Affairs of War take in Number, Space, Force, Di&s;tance,

Time, &amp;c. (things of <HI>Mathematical</HI> con|&s;ideration) in all its parts, in <HI>Tacticks, Ca&s;trametation, Fortifying, Attacquing,</HI> and <HI>Defending.</HI> The Ancients had more oc|ca&s;ion for Mechanicks in the Art of War than we have: Gun-powder readily pro|ducing a force far exceeding all the En|gines, they had contriv'd for Battery. And this I reckon has lo&s;t us a good occa&s;ion of improving our Mechanicks: the cunning of Mankind never exerting it &s;elf &s;o much, as in their Arts of de|&s;troying one another. But, as Gun-powder has made Mechanicks le&s;s &s;erviceable to War; it has made <HI>Geometry</HI> more nece&s;|&s;ary: There being a force or re&s;i&s;tance in the due mea&s;ures and proportions of the Lines and Angles of a Fortification, which contribute much towards its &s;trength. This Art of <HI>Fortification</HI> has been much &s;tudy'd of late, but I dare not affirm, that it has attain'd its utmo&s;t perfection. And tho', where the ground is regular, it admits but of &s;mall variety, the mea&s;ures being pretty well deter|mined by <HI>Geometry</HI> and Experience, yet where the ground is made up of natu|ral <HI>Strengths</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;&s;es,</HI> it affords &s;ome &s;cope for thinking and contrivance.
<PB N="39" REF="42" MS="y">
But there is another much harder piece of <HI>Geometry,</HI> which Gun-powder has given us occa&s;ion to improve, and that is the doctrine of Projectiles; whereon the Art of <HI>Gunnery</HI> is founded.

skill in <HI>Numbers,</HI> it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Of|ficers,</HI> that no Man can be &s;afely tru&s;ted with a Company, that has it not. All the bu&s;ine&s;s is not to fire Mu&s;quets; the managing of Affairs, the dealing with Agents, &amp;c. happen more frequently. And the higher the Command is, the more skill in all the afore&s;aid things is required. And I dare appeal to all the Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> whether <HI>caeteris pari|bus</HI> Officers are not advanced in pro|portion to their skill in <HI>Mathematical Learning;</HI> except, that &s;ome times <HI>Great Names</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> carry it; but &s;till &s;o, as that the Prince depends upon a Man of <HI>Mathematical Learning,</HI> that is put as director to the <HI>Quality,</HI> when that Learn|ing is wanting in it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Navigation</HI> which is made up of <HI>A&s;tronomy</HI> and <HI>Geometry,</HI> is &s;o noble an Art, and to which Mankind owes &s;o many advantages, that upon this &s;ingle account tho&s;e Excellent Sciences de&s;erve mo&s;t of all to be &s;tudy'd, and merit the greate&s;t encouragement from a Nation, that owes to it both its Riches and Se|curity. And not only does the Com|mon Art of <HI>Navigation</HI> depend on <HI>Ma|thematicks,</HI> but whatever improvements
<PB N="41" REF="44">
&s;hall be made in the <HI>Architectura Navalis</HI> or Building of Ships, whether they are de&s;ign'd for Merchant-Ships, or Ships of War, whether &s;wift running, or bearing a great &s;ail, or lying near the wind be de&s;ired, the&s;e mu&s;t all be the improve|ments of <HI>Geometry. Ship-Carpenters</HI> in|deed are very indu&s;trious; but in the&s;e things they acknowledge their inability, confe&s;s that their be&s;t productions are the effects of chance, and implore the <HI>Geometers</HI> help.

<P>The great objection, that is made a|gain&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> in the fore-mention'd great Affairs of <HI>Na|vigation,</HI> the Art <HI>Military,</HI> &amp;c. is, that we &s;ee tho&s;e Affairs are carry'd on and managed by &s;uch, as are not great Ma|thematicians; as Sea-men, Engineers, Surveyers, Gaugers, Clock-makers, Gla&s;s|grinders, &amp;c. and that the Mathemati|cians are commonly Speculative, Retir'd, Studious Men, that are not for an active Life and bu&s;ine&s;s, but content them&s;elves to &s;it in their Studies, and pore over a <HI>Scheme</HI> or a <HI>Calculation.</HI> To which there is this plain and ea&s;y an&s;wer: The Ma|thematicians have not only invented and order'd all the Arts above-mentioned, by which tho&s;e grand Affairs are ma|naged; but have laid down Precepts, contriv'd In&s;truments and Abridgements &s;o plainly, that common Artificers are capable of practi&s;ing by them, tho' they under&s;tand not a tittle of the grounds, on which the Precepts are built. And in this they have con&s;ulted the good and nece&s;&s;ities of Mankind. Tho&s;e Af|fairs demand &s;o great a number of peo|ple
<PB N="43" REF="46">
to manage them, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to breed &s;o many good or even tole|rable Mathematicians. The only thing then to be done was to make their Pre|cepts &s;o plain, that they might be under|&s;tood and practi&s;ed by a multitude of Men. This will be&s;t appear by exam|ples. Nothing is more ordinary than di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s by common <HI>Arith|metick,</HI> by the <HI>Tables of &s;imple and com|pound Intere&s;t, Annuities</HI> &amp;c. Yet how few Men of bu&s;ine&s;s under&s;tand the rea&s;ons of common <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> or the contri|vance of tho&s;e Tables, now they are made; but &s;ecurely rely on them as true. They were the good and the Thorough-Mathematicians, that made tho&s;e Precepts &s;o plain, and Calculated tho&s;e Tables, that facilitate the practice &s;o much. Nothing is more univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, than the mea&s;uring of Plains and Solids: And it is impo&s;&s;ible to breed &s;o many good Mathematicians, as that there may be one, that under&s;tands all the <HI>Geometry</HI> requi&s;ite for Surveying, and mea&s;uring of <HI>Pri&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Pyramids,</HI> and their parts, and mea&s;uring <HI>Fru&s;tums</HI> of <HI>Conoids</HI> and <HI>Spheroids,</HI> in every Market-Town, where &s;uch work is nece&s;&s;ary:
<PB N="44" REF="47">
the Mathematicians have therefore in|&s;crib'd &s;uch Lines on their common Rulers, and Slipping Rulers, and adapted &s;o plain Precepts to them, that every Country-Carpenter, and Gauger, can do the bu&s;ine&s;s accurately enough; tho' he knows no more of tho&s;e In&s;truments, Tables, and Precepts he makes u&s;e of, than a Hobby-hor&s;e. So in <HI>Navigation,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to breed &s;o many good Mathematicians, as would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ail the hundredth part of the Ships of the Nation. But the Mathematicians have laid down &s;o plain and di&s;tinct Precepts, Calculated nece&s;&s;ary Tables, and contriv'd convenient In&s;truments, &s;o that a Sea-man, that knows not the truths, on which his Precepts and Tables depend, may practice &s;afely by them. They <HI>re&s;olve</HI> Triangules every day, that know not the rea&s;on of any one of their <HI>Operations.</HI> Sea-men in their Calculations make u&s;e of <HI>artificial Numbers</HI> or <HI>Loga|rithmes,</HI> that know nothing of their con|trivance: and indeed all tho&s;e great inventions of the mo&s;t famous Mathema|ticians had been almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s for tho&s;e common and great Affairs, had not the practice of them been made ea&s;y to tho&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="48">
who cannot under&s;tand them. From hence it is plain, that it is to tho&s;e <HI>Spe|culative Retir'd Men,</HI> we owe the Rules, the In&s;truments, the Precepts for u&s;ing them, and the Tables which facilitate the di&s;patch of &s;o many great Affairs, and &s;upply Mankind with &s;o many conveni|encies of Life. They were the Men, that taught the World to apply <HI>Arithmetick, A&s;tronomy,</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI> to <HI>Sailing,</HI> with|out which the needle would be &s;till u&s;e|le&s;s. Ju&s;t the &s;ame way in the other parts of <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> the Precepts that are practi&s;ed by multitudes, without be|ing under&s;tood, were contriv'd by &s;ome few great <HI>Mathematicians.</HI></P>
<P>Since then it has been &s;hewn, how much <HI>Mathematicks</HI> improve the Mind, how &s;ub&s;ervient they are to other Arts, and how immediately u&s;eful to the Common-wealth, there needs no other arguments or motives to a Government, to encou|rage them. This is the natural conclu|&s;ion from the&s;e premi&s;es. <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Republick</HI> (<HI>lib.</HI> VII.) takes care, <HI>That, who|ever is to be Educated for Magi&s;tracy, or any con&s;iderable Po&s;t in the Common-wealth, may be in&s;tructed fir&s;t in Arithmetick, then in Geometry, and thirdly in A&s;tronomy.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="49">
And however nece&s;&s;ary tho&s;e Arts were in <HI>Plato's</HI> time, they are much more &s;o now: The Arts of War and Trade re|quiring much more the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e <HI>Sciences</HI> now, than they did then; as be|ing brought to a greater height and per|fection. And accordingly we &s;ee, the&s;e <HI>Sciences</HI> are the particular care of Princes, that de&s;ign to rai&s;e the Force and Power of their Countries. It is well known, that this is none of the lea&s;t Arts, where|by the <HI>French King</HI> has brought his &s;ub|jects to make that Figure at Sea, which they at this time do; I mean, the care He takes for Educating tho&s;e appointed for Sea-&s;ervice in <HI>Mathematical Learning.</HI> For in the <HI>Ordonnance Marine Title</HI> VIII. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He orders, that there be Profe&s;&s;ors to teach Navigation publickly in all the Sea-port Towns, who mu&s;t know <HI>de|&s;igning,</HI> and teach it to their Scholars, in order to lay down the appearances of Coa&s;ts, &amp;c. They are to keep their Schools open, and read four times a week to the Sea-men, where they mu&s;t have Charts, Globes, Spheres, Com|pa&s;&s;es, Quadrants, A&s;trolabes, and all Books and In&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary to teach their Art. The directors of Ho&s;|pitals
<PB N="47" REF="50">
are oblig'd to &s;end thither yearly two or three of their boys to be taught, and to furni&s;h them with Books and In&s;truments. Tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors are oblig'd to examine the Journals depo|&s;ited in the Office of Admiralty, in the place of their e&s;tabli&s;hment; to correct the errours in pre&s;ence of the Sea-men, and to re&s;tore them within a month, &amp;c.'</Q> King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, who well un|der&s;tood the importance of E&s;tabli&s;h|ments of this nature, founded one &s;uch School in <HI>Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital London;</HI> which, I believe, is inferiour to none of the <HI>French:</HI> but 'tis to be wi&s;hed there were many more &s;uch. His pre&s;ent <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> during the time of the late War, E&s;ta|bli&s;hed a <HI>Mathematical Lecture</HI> to breed up Engineers and Officers, as knowing very well the importance thereof. And this continued &s;ome time after the <HI>Peace.</HI> And it is worthy the con&s;ideration of the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the Nation, whether the re&s;tor|ing and continuing this, even in <HI>Peace,</HI> be not expedient for the breeding of En|gineers, who are &s;o u&s;eful and valuable, and &s;o difficult to be had in time of War, and &s;o little dangerous in times of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">
Be&s;ides the crowd of <HI>Merchants, Sea-men, Surveyors, Engineers, Ship-carpenters, Arti&s;ans,</HI> &amp;c. that are to be in&s;tructed in the practice of &s;uch parts of <HI>Mathe|maticks,</HI> as are nece&s;&s;ary to their own bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;pectively, a competent num|ber of <HI>able Mathematicians</HI> ought to be entertained, in order to apply them&s;elves to the practice; not only to in&s;truct the former &s;ort, but likewi&s;e to remove tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, which &s;uch, as do not think beyond their common Rules, can|not overcome. And no doubt it is no &s;mall impediment to the advancement of Arts, that <HI>Speculative Men</HI> and <HI>good Ma|thematicians</HI> are unacquainted with their particular defects, and the &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances in them, that render things <HI>practicable</HI> or <HI>impracticable.</HI> But if there were publick encouragement, we &s;hould have skilful Mathematicians employed in tho&s;e Arts, who would certainly find out and remedy the imperfections of them. The pre&s;ent Lords Commi&s;&s;io|ners of the Admiralty knowing, that there are &s;till two great <HI>De&s;iderata</HI> in Na|vigation, to wit, <HI>The Theory of the varia|tion of the magnetical Needle,</HI> and a <HI>method of finding out the Longitude of any place,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="52">
<HI>that</HI> may be practicable at Sea by Sea-men, and being &s;en&s;ible, of what im|portance it would be to find out either of them, have imployed a very fit per|&s;on, the ingenious M^r. <HI>Hally,</HI> who has joyn'd an entire acquaintance in the practice, to a full and thorough know|ledge of the more ab&s;tru&s;e parts of <HI>Ma|thematicks.</HI> And now that he is return|ed, it is not doubted, but he will &s;atisfy tho&s;e, that &s;ent him, and in due time the World too with his di&s;coveries in both tho&s;e particulars, and in many other, that he has had occa&s;ion to make. And where a long &s;eries of Ob&s;ervations and Experiments is nece&s;&s;ary, he has no doubt laid &s;uch a foundation, as that After-Ob&s;ervers may gradually perfect them. If it were not for more than the correcting the &s;ituation of the Coa&s;ts, where he touched, and by them others, who&s;e relation to the former is known, the Nation is more then triply pay'd; and tho&s;e, who &s;ent him, have by this Mi&s;&s;ion &s;ecured to them&s;elves more true Honour and la&s;ting Fame, than by Actions, that at fir&s;t view appear more Magnificent.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">
The next thing, that is nece&s;&s;ary for the improvement of <HI>Mathematical Learn|ing,</HI> is, That Mathematicks be more ge|nerally &s;tudy'd at our <HI>&V;niver&s;ities</HI> than hitherto they have been. From tho&s;e Seminaries the State ju&s;tly expects and demands tho&s;e, who are acquainted both with the <HI>Speculation</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> In tho&s;e are all the encouragements to them imaginable, Lei&s;ure and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. There are &s;till at hand Books and In&s;truments, as al&s;o other Scholars that have made equal progre&s;s, and may be Comrades in &s;tudy, and the direction of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors. There are al&s;o in perfection all the incitements to this &s;tudy, and e&s;peci|ally an acquaintance with the works of the Ancients, where this <HI>Learning</HI> is &s;o much recommended: There other Facul|ties are &s;tudy'd, to which it is &s;ub&s;ervient. There al&s;o are the Nobility and Gentry bred, who, in due time mu&s;t be called to their &s;hare in the Government of the <HI>Fleets, Army, Trea&s;ury,</HI> and other Publick Employments, where <HI>Mathematical Learn|ing</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and without which, they, tho' of never &s;o great Natural parts, mu&s;t be at the mercy and di&s;cretion of their Servants and Depu|ties;
<PB N="51" REF="54">
who will fir&s;t cheat them, and then laugh at them. And not only Publick Employments, but their Private Con|cerns demand Mathematical knowledge. If their Fortunes lie in Woods, Coal, Salt, Manufactures, &amp;c. the nece&s;&s;ity of this knowledge is open and known: and even in Land-E&s;tates, no undertaking for improvement can be &s;ecurely rely'd upon without it. It not only makes a Man of Quality and E&s;tate his whole Life more Illu&s;trious, and more u&s;eful for all Affairs, (as <HI>Hippocrates</HI> &s;ays, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &amp;c;) but in particular, it is the be&s;t Companion for a Country Life. Were this once become a fa&s;hionable &s;tudy (and the <HI>Mode</HI> exerci&s;es its Em|pire over Learning as well as other things) it is hard to tell, how far it might influence the Morals of our No|bility and Gentry, in rendring them Se|rious, Diligent, Curious, taking them off from the more fruitle&s;s and airy exer|ci&s;es of the Fancy, which they are apt to run into.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">
The only Objection, I can think of, that is brought again&s;t the&s;e &s;tudies, is, that Mathematicks require a parti|cular turn of Head, and a happy Genius that few people are Ma&s;ters of, without which all the pains be&s;towed upon the &s;tudy of them are in vain: They ima|gine that a <HI>Man mu&s;t be Born a Mathema|tician.</HI> I an&s;wer, that this <HI>Exception</HI> is common to Mathematicks and other Arts. That there are per&s;ons, that have a par|ticular capacity and fitne&s;s to one more than another, every body owns: And from experience I dare &s;ay, it is not in any higher degree true concerning Ma|thematicks than the others. A Man of good &s;en&s;e and application is the per|&s;on, that is by nature fitted for them: e&s;pecially if he begins betimes; And if his circum&s;tances have been &s;uch, that this did not happen, by prudent directi|on the defect may be &s;upply'd as much as in any Art what&s;oever. The only advantage this Objection has, is, that it is on the &s;ide of &s;oftne&s;s and idlene&s;s, tho&s;e powerful Allies.</P>
<P>There is nothing further remains, Sir, but that I give you my thoughts in ge|neral concerning the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Method</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="56">
of &s;tudying <HI>Mathematicks;</HI> which I &s;hall do very &s;hortly, as knowing that you are already acquainted with the be&s;t me|thods, and others with you may have them ea&s;ily from the be&s;t and able&s;t hands.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I lay down for a princi|ple, that no body at an <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> is to be taught the practice of any rule without the true and &s;olid rea&s;on and demon&s;tration of the &s;ame.

Secondly, no part of Mathematicks ought to be taught by <HI>Compendiums.</HI> This follows from the former. <HI>Compen|diums</HI> are fit to give a general and &s;u|perficial knowledge, not a thorough one. It's time, and not the bulk of Books, we ought to be &s;paring of: And I appeal to any per&s;on of Experience, whether &s;o|lid knowledge is not acquir'd in &s;horter time by Books treating fully of their &s;ubjects, than by Compendiums and A|bridgements.</P>
<P>From hence it follows, that the <HI>Ele|ments</HI> of <HI>Arithmetick</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI> are to be taught. <HI>Euclid</HI> in his thirteen Books of Elements gives us both: but our pre&s;ent way of Notation &s;uper&s;edes &s;ome of tho&s;e of <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> as demon|&s;trating the Rules from the Operations them&s;elves. There remain then the fir&s;t &s;ix Books for the <HI>Geometry</HI> of <HI>Plains,</HI> and the la&s;t three for <HI>Stereometry.</HI> The re&s;t ought to be read in their own place for the perfection of <HI>Arithmetick.</HI> In teaching the&s;e, care ought to be taken to make u&s;e of &s;uch Examples, as &s;uit with the condition of the Scholar. For in&s;tance, <HI>Merchants Accounts</HI> and <HI>Affairs</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="58">
for Examples of the Operations of <HI>A|rithmetick,</HI> to one that is afterwards to have a concern that way; whereas to a Man of the fir&s;t Quality, examples from <HI>the encrea&s;e</HI> and <HI>decrea&s;e of the peo|ple,</HI> or from <HI>Land or Sea-Force,</HI> and from the <HI>Tacticks</HI> ought to be propo&s;ed. For it is certain, nothing makes one tyr'd &s;ooner, than the frivolous and trifling examples, that are commonly brought for the exerci&s;e of the Rules of <HI>Arith|metick</HI> and <HI>Geometry:</HI> tho' this is com|mon to them with the other Arts, as <HI>Grammar, Logick,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The manner of Writing of the Ma|thematicians of this and the former Age makes <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> with the man|ner of con&s;tructing its Tables, &amp;c. al|mo&s;t <HI>Elementary;</HI> and the <HI>practical Geo|metry</HI> commonly &s;o call'd, is very fit to come next, as an elegant application of the <HI>Elements</HI> of <HI>Geometry</HI> to Bu&s;ine&s;s, as <HI>Surveying, Gauging,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>After the Elements of <HI>Sphericks,</HI> which are perfectly well handled by <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> a full in&s;ight into the principles of <HI>A&s;tro|nomy</HI> will be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59">
<HI>Mechanicks</HI> come next to be read, which are the Ground of a great part of Natural Learning: and afterwards <HI>Op|ticks, Catoptricks</HI> and <HI>Dioptricks.</HI></P>
<P>But none of the&s;e except the Elements can be fully under&s;tood until one is pret|ty well skill'd in <HI>Conick-&s;ections:</HI> And all the&s;e are made more ea&s;y by &s;ome to|lerable skill in <HI>Algebra,</HI> and its applica|tion to <HI>Geometry.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e foundations being laid, any one may with great ea&s;e pur&s;ue the &s;tudy of the Mathematicks, as his occa|&s;ions require: either in its ab&s;tract parts, and the more <HI>recondite Geometry,</HI> and its application to Natural knowledge; or in Mechanicks, by pro&s;ecuting the <HI>Sta|ticks, Hydro&s;taticks, Balli&s;ticks,</HI> &amp;c; or in <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> by its application to <HI>Geogra|phy, Navigation, Gnomonicks, A&s;trolabes,</HI> &amp;c. But in mo&s;t of the&s;e a particular order is not nece&s;&s;ary. Any one may take that fir&s;t, which he is mo&s;t incli|ned to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not offer you any advice con|cerning the choice of Books, but refer you (if you want any) to the direction of tho&s;e, who are Eminent among you
