<L>FROM Otway's and immortal <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s page</L>
<L>Venice <HI>is grown &s;amiliar to our &s;tage.</HI></L>
<L>Here the <HI>Rialto</HI> often has di&s;play'd</L>
<L>At once a bridge, a &s;treet, and mart of trade;</L>
<L>Here, trea&s;on threat'ning to lay <HI>Venice</HI> flat,</L>
<L>Grave candle-&s;nuffers oft in Senate &s;at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To-night in <HI>Venice</HI> we have plac'd our &s;cene,</L>
<L>Where I have been&mdash;liv'd&mdash;died&mdash;as you have &s;een.</L>
<L>Yet, that my travels I may not di&s;grace,</L>
<L>Let me&mdash;&s;ince now reviv'd&mdash;de&s;cribe the place!</L>
<L>Nor wou'd the Tour of <HI>Europe</HI> prove our &s;hame,</L>
<L>Cou'd every <HI>Macaroni</HI> do the &s;ame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The City's &s;elf&mdash;a wonder, all agree&mdash;</L>
<L>Appears to &s;pring, like <HI>Venus,</HI> from the &s;ea.</L>
<L>Founded on piles, it ri&s;es from the &s;trand,</L>
<L>Like Trifle plac'd upon a &s;ilver &s;tand:</L>
<L>While many a le&s;&s;er i&s;le the pro&s;pect crowns,</L>
<L>Looking like &s;ugar plums, or floating towns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hor&s;es and mules ne'er pace the narrow &s;treet,</L>
<L>Where crouded walkers elbow all they meet:</L>
<L>No carts and coaches o'er the pavement clatter;</L>
<L>Ladies, Prie&s;ts, Lawyers, Nobles,&mdash;go by water:</L>
<L>Light boats and gondolas tran&s;port them all,</L>
<L>Like one eternal party to <HI>Vauxhall.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now hey for merriment!&mdash;hence grie&s; and &s;ear!</L>
<L>The jolly Carnival leads in the year;</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="79">Calls the young Loves and Plea&s;ures to its aid;</L>
<L>A three-months jubilee and ma&s;querade!</L>
<L>With gaiety the throng'd piazza glows,</L>
<L>Mountebanks, jugglers, boxers, puppet-&s;hows:</L>
<L>Ma&s;k'd and di&s;guis'd the ladies meet their &s;parks,</L>
<L>While <HI>Venus</HI> bails the mummers of <HI>St. Mark's.</HI></L>
<L>There holy friars turn gallants, and there too</L>
<L>Nuns yield to all the frailties&mdash;"Fle&s;h is heir to."</L>
<L>There dear Ridottos con&s;tantly delight,</L>
<L>And &s;weet Harmonic Meetings ev'ry night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once in each year the <HI>Doge</HI> a&s;cends his barge,</L>
<L>Fine as a <HI>London</HI> Mayor's, and thrice as large;</L>
<L>Throws a huge ring of gold into the &s;ea,</L>
<L>And cries&mdash;"Thus We, thy Sov'reign, marry thee.</L>
<L>Oh may'&s;t thou ne'er, like many a mortal &s;pou&s;e,</L>
<L>Prove full of &s;torms, and faitble&s;s to thy vows!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One word of politics&mdash;and then Pve done&mdash;</L>
<L>The &s;tate of <HI>Venice</HI> Nobles rule alone.</L>
<L>Thrice happy <HI>Britain,</HI> where with equal band</L>
<L>Three well pois'd &s;tates unite to rule the land!</L>
<L>Thus in the theatre, as well as &s;tate.</L>
<L>Three ranks mu&s;t join to make us ble&s;s'd and great.</L>
<L>King, Lords, and Commons, o'er the nation &s;it;</L>
<L>Pit, Box, and Gallery, rule the realms of wit.</L>
