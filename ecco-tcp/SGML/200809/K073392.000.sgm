<P>INTRODUCTORY LETTER TO <HI>MR. FLAXMAN.</HI></P>
<P>RECEIVE, my dear friend, with your u&s;ual kindne&s;s, the long-&s;u&s;pended Work, of which I had the plea&s;ure of re|peating to you a few ver&s;es (as a joyous &s;alute) on your &s;afe arrival from Rome in the year 1794. I then hoped to render it a more early and a more chearful tribute to your improved talents, and to our long friend&s;hip. My production is not &s;uch as I intended; yet I tru&s;t, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, it is not utterly unworthy of your accept|ance, or of that favour which every warm heart mu&s;t be inclined to hope its endeavours to celebrate the genius of a friend may receive from the public.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">You know but too well what impediments of anxiety and affliction have thwarted, for years, the progre&s;s of a performance that the hone&s;t pride of friend&s;hip would have zealou&s;ly laboured to make more worthy of the arti&s;t to whom it is in&s;cribed. I am yet willing to think that affliction (&s;o often u&s;eful in life) may have had &s;ome &s;ort of beneficial influence on this compo&s;ition:
<Q>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.</Q></P>
<P>As much as my Work has lo&s;t, in knowledge and re|finement, by the &s;evere trouble, that interrupted and changed its cour&s;e, it may have gained, perhaps, in nature and pathos. I could hardly convert the &s;ufferings of your dear di&s;ciple to a u&s;e more noble, than that of making them in&s;trumental, in any degree, to the reputa|tion of &s;uch an in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>When I began the Poem, I intended that it &s;hould comprize a &s;ketch of modern as well as ancient art: but
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
my attention has been turned from Donatello, Ghiberti, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to the dearer juvenile arti&s;t who, after the faire&s;t promi&s;e of future excellence, under your tender and animating care, has been de&s;tined to lo&s;e the uncommon advantages he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and valued, by a length of &s;ickne&s;s and complicated &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>I have now watched, you know, con&s;iderably more than two years over this intere&s;ting invalide: I have &s;een him enduring a horrible &s;eries and variety of increa&s;ing tortures; yet in this very long trial of a martyr's con|&s;tancy and courage I have never heard a &s;ingle murmur e&s;cape from his lips; but have beheld him triumph over the &s;evere&s;t unmerited corporeal torments by the &s;erenity, fortitude, and &s;weetne&s;s of a &s;pirit truly angelic. In a part of this long and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period I have re&s;umed, at his affectionate reque&s;t, my &s;u&s;pended Work, and ad|vanced in it, by &s;uch troubled indu&s;try, as tho&s;e only can perfectly conceive, who have forced the mind to labour
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
with motives of &s;imilar affection, and with &s;imilar di&s;|quietude.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, you will not blame me for allowing my ju&s;t admiration of your affectionate and mag|nanimous, though di&s;abled di&s;ciple, to alter the intended current of my ver&s;e. Writing, as I have ever done, from the heart, I have followed its imperious &s;ugge&s;tions; and your &s;ympathy, my dear friend, which I am confident I &s;hall obtain, in this part of my &s;ubject, will form, at once, my ju&s;tification and my reward.</P>
<P>For your credit I ought, perhaps, to apprize my reader, that whatever defects he may di&s;cover in my Book, they are to be a&s;cribed &s;olely to my&s;elf. As my &s;eque&s;tered life has not allowed me to derive from &s;everal di&s;tant friends (of intelligence far &s;uperior to mine on the &s;ubject which I pre&s;ume to treat) that light which might otherwi&s;e have embelli&s;hed my compo&s;ition, I ought not to expo&s;e them to a &s;u&s;picion of having &s;ugge&s;ted, or countenanced any
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
erroneous ideas, that a production of retired, yet often in|terrupted &s;tudy, may happen to contain.</P>
<P>To guard my&s;elf al&s;o from a charge of pre&s;umption, it may be proper to declare that, in venturing to write upon Sculpture, I pretend not to in&s;truct the accom|pli&s;hed arti&s;t, or the real connoi&s;&s;eur; (two cla&s;&s;es of men whom I ought rather to con&s;ult for information, and from whom I mu&s;t ever have much to learn!) but I had per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that, by an exten&s;ive Poem on this un|tried &s;ubject, I might be &s;o fortunate as to promote the celebrity of a friend, in who&s;e talents I delight; and afford &s;ome kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to all the admirers of Sculpture, in their various endeavours to naturalize a de&s;erving Art, which may &s;till be con&s;idered as little more than an alien in our country, if we compare the portion of public notice and favour, which it has hitherto obtained among us, to the honour and influence it enjoyed in the ancient world.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">To encourage a general delight in the ingenious Arts, and to extend the reputation of their &s;ucce&s;sful profe&s;&s;ors, has ever appeared to me one of the mo&s;t de&s;irable purpo&s;es that Poetry can pur&s;ue; and particularly when that pur|po&s;e is happily blended with the intere&s;t and the honour of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Should the wi&s;hes of tho&s;e whom I regard induce me, in a &s;ea&s;on of more tranquillity and lei&s;ure, to delineate the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of modern Art, in another Poem, for which I have abundant materials, I &s;hall probably in|troduce that new &s;ubject by a &s;ketch of the injuries that Sculpture &s;u&s;tained from the &s;ect of Iconocla&s;ts, or Image-breakers, and the animation it might acquire from the di&s;covery of Herculaneum, and a more &s;pirited re&s;earch in the &s;ubterranean cities.</P>
<P>I intimate the&s;e topics, to obviate any &s;urpri&s;e that my reader might feel on not finding them mentioned in the pre&s;ent Work. They appeared to me as more &s;uited to
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
form the line of connexion between the two di&s;tinct pro|vinces of ancient and modern Sculpture.</P>
<P>But whatever fortune may attend me as the admirer and the eulogi&s;t of your noble art, that you, my excellent friend, may long cultivate and improve it, and that uni|ver&s;al applau&s;e and increa&s;ing felicity may be ju&s;tly and graciou&s;ly be&s;towed by earth and Heaven on your labours and your life, is the cordial wi&s;h of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very &s;incere and fervent, Though deeply-afflicted friend, W. H.</SIGNED>

<L>Fierce as thou art, tho&s;e &s;hadowy forms revere,</L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="14">Which in the pla&s;tic &s;oul of Genius re&s;t,</L>
<L>Folded, like future gems, in Nature's brea&s;t!</L>
<L>To peaceful Sculpture's unarm'd &s;on accord</L>
<L>Safety and honour for no mean reward:</L>

<L>Thus, ardent Flaxman! while you now review</L>
<L N="20">Rome's &s;culptur'd glories in a fond adieu,</L>

<L>Rip'ning thy labours much, and more thy mind,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e years, that gave thy faculties to &s;hine,</L>
<L>In mi&s;ts of malady en&s;hrouded mine.</L>
</LG>

<L>Think with what grief the &s;pirit of thy friend,</L>
<L>Anxious as thine, but anxious to no end,</L>
<L>Year after year, of feveri&s;h &s;loth the prey,</L>
<L N="40">Has &s;een each project of his mind decay,</L>

<L>I play'd with Fiction as a child of Truth.</L>
<L>When my free mind in health's light ve&s;t was clad,</L>

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE <HI>FIRST EPISTLE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="note">
<HEAD><HI>NOTE I. Ver. 87.</HI> WARM'D by the light they love, the very fragments &s;ound.</HEAD>
<P>An allu&s;ion to the frequently-cited ver&s;e of Juvenal:
<Q>Dimidio magicae re&s;onant ubi Memnone chordae.</Q></P>
<P>There is hardly any work of antiquity more celebrated than this my&s;terious image; a favourite object of ancient and of modern curio&s;ity! Con&s;idering the attention paid to it in different ages, it is &s;ingular that the mutilated &s;tatue &s;hould &s;till retain a name which, according to an ancient tradition, was a&s;&s;igned to it improperly.</P>
<P>This miraculous colo&s;&s;al figure is commonly called the Statue of Memnon, and &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent an Aethiopian prince of that name, the &s;on of Tithonus and Aurora: but Pau&s;anias, from whom we de|rive one of the early accounts of it, expre&s;sly &s;ays, the inhabitants of the city where it was placed (the Thebans of Aegypt) a&s;&s;erted that it was
<PB N="168" REF="176">
not a repre&s;entation of Memnon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>PAUSANIAS, p. 101. edit. Kuhnii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, but of Phamenophis, a native of their country; "and I have heard per&s;ons affirm," continues Pau&s;a|nias, <Q>that it is the &s;tatue of Se&s;o&s;tris which Camby&s;es broke a&s;under; and now as much of it as extends from the head to the middle of the body is thrown down: the remainder is &s;till &s;itting, and &s;ounds every day at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. Its &s;ound is mo&s;t like the bur&s;ting of a &s;tring on the harp or lyre.</Q></P>
<P>The intelligent and accurate Strabo has recorded his own vi&s;it (in a more early age) to this &s;tatue, in company with his friend Aelius Gallus, and a military train. He declares that he heard the miraculous &s;ound, but intimates a doubt whether it really proceeded from the ba&s;e, from the fragment of the figure, or from the artifice of per&s;ons who formed a bu&s;y circle round it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>STRABO, Lib. xvii. p. 1171. edit. 1707.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Strabo does not a&s;&s;ign any name to the &s;tatue in que&s;tion; but calls the &s;cene where it was placed the Memnonium. "Here," he &s;ays, <Q>are two colo&s;&s;al figures, each of a &s;ingle &s;tone, and near to each other. One is pre&s;erved; the upper part of the other has fallen, and, as they &s;ay, by an earthquake.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;agacious geographer expre&s;&s;es, in very &s;trong terms, his un|willingne&s;s to believe that the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ound he heard could be the &s;pontaneous production of the &s;tone it&s;elf<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable traveller of our own country, the learned, faithful, and elaborate Pococke, has laboured to gratify curio&s;ity concerning this

this celebrated image, by a very minute de&s;cription, illu&s;trated by en|gravings: yet with every advantage that erudition and a &s;urvey of the fragment could afford him, he is obliged to leave the &s;ubject &s;till in|volved in con&s;iderable darkne&s;s; for among the various &s;tatues that he examined in this intere&s;ting &s;cene, (the ruins of Thebes,) he found that two of them had preten&s;ions to be regarded as the miraculous image<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. de Caylus has di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;tatue of remote antiquity from that of a later time in the following remark on Aegyptian antiquities:</P><Q>Il ne faut pas confondre la &s;tatue de Memnon, dont parle Pline, avec celle qui &s;ub&s;i&s;te, et qui a in&s;pir&eacute; une &s;i grande curio&s;it&eacute; aux voyageurs anciens et modernes; non &s;eulement cette derni&egrave;re e&s;t colo&s;&s;ale, mais elle e&s;t de granite.

<Q><P>In the &s;econd court (of the temple) are remains of two &s;tatues of black granite. That to the we&s;t, which is &s;itting, mea&s;ured, from the hand to the elbow, five feet; thence to the &s;houlder four. The head is three feet and a half long, and the ear is one foot in length. The &s;tatue to the ea&s;t is three feet five inches long in the foot. At a di&s;tance from it is the head with the cap. It is three feet &s;ix inches long, and behind it is the ornament of the dome-leaf. Some per&s;ons have thought that one of the&s;e is the &s;tatue of Memnon. From the temple I went to the &s;tatues, which I &s;hall call the colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues of Memnon. They are towards Medinet-Habou. I &s;pent above half a day at the&s;e &s;tatues. They are of a very particular &s;ort of porous, hard granite, &s;uch as I never &s;aw before. It mo&s;t re&s;embles the eagle-&s;tone.</P>
<P>The &s;tatues look to the &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and are on a pede&s;tal or plinth, entirely plain. That to the north is thirty feet long and
<PB N="170" REF="178">
&s;eventeen broad. The pede&s;tal of the other is thirty-three feet long and nineteen wide, and they are about thirty feet apart. That to the &s;outh is of one &s;tone. The &s;tatue to the north has been broken off at the middle, above the arms, that lie on the hams, and it has been built up with five tiers of &s;tones&mdash;one to the top of the clinch of the elbow, another almo&s;t half way up the arm, one to the arm-pits, the fourth to the neck, and the fifth, the head and neck of one &s;tone. The other tiers have two &s;tones in front, except that the middle tier has three; and there are two &s;tones in the thickne&s;s of the &s;tatue. The feet are broken a quarter off from the toes: but as I did not take a particular draught of the parts of the &s;tatue that are maimed, I thought it better to give it entire from the drawing and ob&s;ervations I did make. I found the height, from the bottom of the foot to the top of the knee, to be about nineteen feet; from the bottom of the foot to the ankle, two feet &s;ix inches; to the top of the in&s;tep, four feet; the foot is five feet broad, and the leg is four feet deep. The ornament behind the head &s;eemed to be the dome-leaf, as I have it on a &s;tatue of Harpocrates. At the &s;ide of the legs are two reliefs, and one between the legs, of the natural height, but much defaced. Between the former and the great &s;tatue are hieroglyphics. The pe|de&s;tal of the imperfect &s;tatue is cracked acro&s;s, at the di&s;tance of about ten feet from the back part. There are al&s;o &s;ome flaws and cracks in the other &s;tatue; but it is of one &s;tone, which I dare po&s;i|tively affirm, and in which I could not be mi&s;taken, having been twice at the &s;tatues. I &s;pent half a day there, and took down in my notes an account of every &s;tone of which the upper part of the other is built. On the pede&s;tal of the imperfect &s;tatue is a Greek epigram; and on the in&s;teps and legs, for about eight feet high, are &s;everal in|&s;criptions in Greek and Latin; &s;ome being epigrams in honour of Memnon; others, the greater part, te&s;timonies of tho&s;e who heard
<PB N="171" REF="179">
the &s;ound; and &s;ome al&s;o in unknown characters. All the in&s;crip|tions are ill cut, and in bad language, both on account of the hard|ne&s;s of the &s;tone, and the ignorance of the people, who probably made money by cutting the&s;e in&s;criptions for tho&s;e that came to hear the &s;ound. I copied them with all the exactne&s;s I could; though many of them were very difficult to be under&s;tood, and I was not en|tirely undi&s;turbed while I was doing it.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far I have tran&s;cribed the indu&s;trious and accurate Pococke, be|cau&s;e his men&s;uration affords a &s;atisfactory idea of Aegyptian &s;culpture. I omit his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the arguments concerning the point, which of the two &s;tatues he has mentioned is the real Memnon, becau&s;e &s;ome ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by a later and more lively traveller of France have led me to believe that the report of Pau&s;anias was perfectly true, and that the marvellous &s;tatue was never intended to repre&s;ent the prince of Aethiopia. How it acquired the name of Memnon we &s;hall gradually di&s;cover.</P>
<P>M. Savary, in his elegant, amu&s;ing Letters on Aegypt, has compared &s;uch reliques of Thebes as he could inve&s;tigate him&s;elf, with the de&s;crip|tions of this magnificent &s;cenery that are to be found in ancient authors, particularly Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he en|deavours to throw new light on this miraculous image. He falls, how|ever, into an evident mi&s;take, in &s;aying that Strabo calls it the Statue of Memnon. That illu&s;trious and accurate geographer only &s;ays, after naming a place, which he calls <GAP DESC="foreign">, a word that may &s;ignify the Temple, or perhaps merely the monuments of Memnon, that it contained two colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, which he proceeds to de&s;cribe in the manner I have already mentioned. But the ingenious French traveller, borrowing, perhaps, a hint from Strabo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>STRABO, p. 1167.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, though he does not intimate
<PB N="172" REF="180">
that he did, has ventured to be&s;tow on the broken Colo&s;&s;us, commonly called the &s;tatue of Memnon, the name of O&s;ymanduas; as he con|ceives that the dimen&s;ions of the figure, and the &s;cene around it, &s;uf|ficiently an&s;wer to the magnificent de&s;cription by which Diodorus has commemorated the tomb of that Aegyptian monarch, who&s;e title Pococke be&s;tows on another colo&s;&s;al figure. M. Savary goes &s;till far|ther in his probable conjecture, and imagines that Camby&s;es was tempted to break the &s;tupendous image by the in&s;cription which it bore, accord|ing to the narrative of the Greek hi&s;torian; which in&s;cription the French traveller tran&s;lates in the following words: <Q>Je &s;uis O&s;iman|du&egrave;, roi des rois. Si l'on veut &s;avoir combien je &s;uis grand, et o&ugrave; je repo&s;e, que l'on detrui&s;e quelqu'un de ces ouvrages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>DIODORUS SICULUS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</Q>&mdash; <Q>I am O&s;ymanduas, the king of kings. If any one wi&s;hes to know how great I am, and where I repo&s;e, let him <HI>conquer</HI> &s;ome of my works.</Q> The word <GAP DESC="foreign"> (literally, "let him <HI>conquer,</HI>") is rendered by the Engli&s;h traveller, "let him <HI>&s;urpa&s;s</HI>;" by the French traveller, <Q>let him <HI>de&s;troy.</HI></Q> The latter, in his interpretation of this &s;uperb in&s;crip|tion, &s;eems to reduce it to a level with the plea&s;ant, my&s;terious epitaph in Gil Bias: "A qui e&s;ta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcias;" and to &s;uppo&s;e that it was de&s;igned to lead &s;ome ingenious interpreter to the happy di&s;covery of a latent trea&s;ure. Though I pre&s;ume to rally the accompli&s;hed traveller of France for his &s;ubtle con&s;truction, I am &s;till particularly inclined to credit the conjecture of M. Savary concerning the proper title of this celebrated colo&s;&s;al figure, becau&s;e it tends to con|firm another conjecture by which I would account for the manner in which it acquired the very different name of Memnon. Diodorus Si|culus, in de&s;cribing the tomb of O&s;ymanduas, and the colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues with which it was adorned, declares that the&s;e &s;tatues were the work of
<PB N="173" REF="181">
Memnon Sycnites. This &s;culptor mu&s;t have been an arti&s;t of the highe&s;t celebrity in his time; hence perhaps his mo&s;t remarkable &s;tatue a&s;&s;umed the name of its maker, in preference to that of the monarch whom it was de&s;igned to repre&s;ent; and hence, as the name of this marvellous &s;culptor happened to be al&s;o the name by which an heroic prince of Aethiopia was di&s;tingui&s;hed, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have founded the city of Abydus in Aegypt, many fabulous &s;tories &s;eem to have been invented to account for what in all probability never exi&s;ted; I mean, a &s;culptural repre&s;entation of the Aethiopian hero (the ally of Priam, and the un&s;ucce&s;sful antagoni&s;t of Achilles) among the colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues of Thebes.</P>
<P>Having expatiated &s;o far on the name of this intere&s;ting image, I will add but a few remarks on its miraculous &s;ound. Strabo and Savary &s;eem to have agreed in the idea, that the wonder was rather to be &s;lighted as the my&s;terious device of prie&s;tcraft, than to be regarded as a genuine miracle of Nature. Yet the eminent philo&s;ophical poet of Derby&s;hire, who has introduced this fa&s;cinating &s;tatue into his delightful Botanic Garden, appears, in a note to that poem, to think that philo&s;ophy might very hone&s;tly contrive to produce a &s;imilar effect.</P>
<P>It may be well worth the attention, both of arti&s;ts and philo&s;ophers, to con&s;ider how far it may be po&s;&s;ible and proper to engage the &s;en&s;e of hearing as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to enhance the plea&s;ure of &s;ight, when that plea|&s;ure ari&s;es from any grand work of Art. Antiquity has proved that the picture of a battle may be exhibited to advantage with an accom|paniment of martial mu&s;ic; and perhaps in a great naval monument, it would be ea&s;y to introduce, and conceal &s;uch works of mu&s;ical me|chani&s;m as might occa&s;ionally increa&s;e, in a mo&s;t powerful degree, the delight ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>I cannot quit the &s;tatue of Memnon without mentioning the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious of his ancient vi&s;itors. The&s;e were the emperor Hadrian with
<PB N="174" REF="182">
his empre&s;s Sabina, and a prince perhaps not le&s;s accompli&s;hed, and certainly more amiable than Hadrian, that de&s;erving idol of the Roman people, Germanicus! The hi&s;torian Tacitus, who has recorded the vi&s;it of the latter to this attractive &s;tatue, &s;ays not a &s;yllable expre&s;&s;ive of his own opinion concerning the miraculous &s;ound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ceterum Germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum; quorum praecipua fuere Memnonis &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea effigies, ubi radiis &s;olis icta e&s;t vocalem &s;onum reddens.</Q> TACITUS.</NOTE>. I confe&s;s my&s;elf in|clined to imagine that the marvel originated in the avaricious ingenuity of tho&s;e who were engaged in &s;hewing this celebrated &s;pectacle: but a different opinion was entertained by a modern writer on &s;tatues, who&s;e authority is &s;o re&s;pectable, that I &s;hall &s;ubmit to the reader his more candid ideas on this intere&s;ting image. The Abb&eacute; Comte de Gua&s;co, who&s;e learned and elegant hi&s;torical e&s;&s;ay, "De l'U&s;age des Statues," I &s;hall have very frequent occa&s;ion to cite and to applaud, &s;peaks of this figure in his chapter on the prodigies and miracles attributed to &s;tatues. He de&s;cribes it as a &s;tatue rai&s;ed to Memnon by Amenophis the Second, on the banks of the Nile; and after noticing the incredulity of Strabo, he &s;ays in a note, which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe, that modern travellers had a&s;&s;ured him they had been witne&s;&s;es of the phenomenon, which, in his opinion, may be fairly and naturally explained by atmo&s;pherical in|fluence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Des voyageurs modernes m'ont a&s;&s;ur&eacute; avoir &eacute;t&eacute; temoins de ce ph&eacute;nomene.

Stocks and &s;tones were confe&s;&s;edly wor&s;hipped as cele&s;tial powers, in that land of ingenuity, before any thing like a &s;tatue, bu&s;t, or medallion appeared.

<P>Of an intere&s;ting character, &s;o long the &s;port and victim of fancy, fable, and conjecture, it is natural to de&s;ire, but very difficult to obtain, a &s;imple, rational hi&s;tory. Who &s;hall &s;olve the doubt whether Pro|metheus really exi&s;ted or not? He has been called a Cretan, an Aegyptian, a Scythian; and Olaus Rudbecke, in that marvellous work of exten&s;ive erudition and fanciful ingenuity, his Atlantica, &s;eems inclined to make him a Swede, and claim him for a countryman with the re&s;t of the Titans. Of our own modern writers, Lord Bacon and Mr. Bryant (two re&s;pectable names) agree with the emperor Julian in their inclina|tion to melt this primaeval arti&s;t into a mere allegory. I confe&s;s my&s;elf rather inclined to the opinion of the learned and intelligent Brucker, who, in his elaborate and candid Hi&s;tory of Philo&s;ophy, has very mo|de&s;tly &s;tated &s;uch conjectures of his own, concerning this celebrated per&s;onage, as account, in a very probable manner, for all his fabu|lous adventures.

This wall was in circuit forty furlongs, three hundred bricks thick, and in height (as Cte&s;ias &s;ays) a hundred yards, upon which were turrets a hundred and forty yards high. The third and mo&s;t in|ward wall immediately &s;urrounded the palace thirty furlongs in com|pa&s;s, and far &s;urmounted the middle wall both in height and thick|ne&s;s; and on this wall and the towers were repre&s;ented the &s;hapes of all &s;orts of living creatures, artificially expre&s;&s;ed in mo&s;t lively co|lours. E&s;pecially was repre&s;ented a general hunting of all &s;orts of wild bea&s;ts, each four cubits high and upwards. Among&s;t the&s;e was to be &s;een Semiramis on hor&s;eback, &s;triking a leopard through with a dart; and next to her, her hu&s;band Ninus in clo&s;e fight with a lion, piercing him with his lance. This palace far excelled that on the other &s;ide of the river, both in greatne&s;s and adornments; for the outmo&s;t wall of that (made of well-burnt brick) was but thirty furlongs in compa&s;s. In&s;tead of the curious portraiture of bea&s;ts, there were the brazen &s;tatues of Ninus and Semiramis, the great officers, and of Jupiter, whom the Babylonians call Belus, and likewi&s;e armies drawn up in battalia; and divers &s;orts of hunting were there repre&s;ented, to

<P>Such are the wonders of early art which Diodorus has recorded as the works of Semiramis, on the authority of Cte&s;ias, a native of Cnidos, who became the favourite phy&s;ician of a Per&s;ian monarch, Artaxerxes Mnemon, and in that &s;ituation had better opportunities of acquiring hi&s;torical information concerning the antiquities of A&s;ia, than his coun|trymen in general po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Of Cte&s;ias's exten&s;ive writings only a few fragments remain, which are printed as a &s;upplement to Herodotus, in the be&s;t editions of that hi&s;torian. The credit of Cte&s;ias has been &s;e|verely attacked, both by ancient and modern writers; but M. Freret vindicates his veracity in &s;everal particulars, like a very able advocate, in more than one of his elaborate di&s;&s;ertations on points of ancient hi&s;tory, in&s;erted in the Memoirs of the French Academy. The kind of credit that we may rationally give to the curious de&s;cription that I have cited, &s;eems to be very candidly a&s;certained by the Abb&eacute; Gua&s;co, who thinks that although works of &s;uch magnificence were hardly executed at a period &s;o early as that a&s;&s;igned to Semiramis, yet it is probable that &s;uch actually appeared in Babylon in later ages, but before art had made

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XI. Ver. 270.</HI> And ble&s;s'd a bold progenitor in thee.</HEAD>
<P>Daedalus was univer&s;ally revered by antiquity as the father of Grecian &s;culpture: but in proportion as his genius became an object of public veneration, his per&s;onal hi&s;tory was &s;o involved in the decorations or di&s;gui&s;es of fable, that (to the regret of tho&s;e who love to inve&s;tigate the lives of meritorious men) it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to obtain a &s;atisfactory account of this celebrated &s;culptor, architect, and mechani&s;t, who&s;e early and &s;ucce&s;sful ingenuity has &s;o ju&s;tly endeared his name to every lover of art.</P>
<P>The learned Junius has a&s;&s;igned a very copious article to Daedalus, in his catalogue of antient arti&s;ts; and the Abb&eacute; Gedoyn (the re&s;pect|able tran&s;lator of Quintilian and Pau&s;anias) has introduced a hi&s;tory of Daedalus into the Memoirs of the French Academy. The&s;e two elabo|rate writers have collected all that antiquity could furni&s;h to elucidate his life; but they both &s;eem to admit, as an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, one mo&s;t di&s;honourable circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of their hero, which I am inclined to con&s;ider as not more entitled to &s;erious credit than the mo&s;t fabulous portion of his adventures; I mean, the horrid &s;uppo&s;ition that he enviou&s;ly murdered his nephew and his di&s;ciple, for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing inge|nuity &s;uperior to his own.</P>
<P>Of this I &s;hall &s;peak in its place: let me fir&s;t relate the more early particulars that ancient writers have recorded concerning this celebrated &s;culptor. He was by birth an Athenian; and though authors differ on the name of his father, they agree in repre&s;enting him as the grand|&s;on
<PB N="201" REF="208">
or great-grand&s;on of Erectheus, the &s;ixth &s;overeign of Athens; and Pau&s;anias a&s;&s;erts that he lived in the period when Oedipus reigned in Thebes; that is, about half a century before the &s;iege of Troy. Dio|dorus Siculus, who may be called the earlie&s;t biographer of Daedalus that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, de&s;cribes him as having greatly improved the rude &s;culpture of his age, and excited the admiration of his contemporaries, before the charge of having de&s;troyed his di&s;ciple reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of flying from his country.</P>
<P>In the account that Diodorus has given of this very improbable crime, there is one particular that &s;eems to mark the whole &s;tory as a fabulous invention. It is &s;aid that this ingenious di&s;ciple, the &s;on of his &s;i&s;ter, was led to invent a &s;aw by the accident of finding the jaw of a &s;erpent, and by ob&s;erving the u&s;e to which its teeth might be &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully applied. It is al&s;o &s;aid that Daedalus, being &s;urpri&s;ed and que&s;|tioned in the act of burying the murdered youth, an&s;wered, that he was con&s;igning a &s;erpent to the earth.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian mentions it as a wonder (and it &s;eems one of tho&s;e &s;pecious wonders, which the Greeks were &s;o fond of inventing) that the &s;ame animal (the &s;erpent) &s;hould prove both the &s;ource of a mo&s;t u&s;eful invention, and the means of detecting an execrable crime. The &s;up|po&s;ed criminal is &s;aid to have been condemned by that &s;olemn tribunal the Areopagus: but the mode in which the royal &s;culptor is imagined to have accompli&s;hed the de&s;truction of his di&s;ciple is &s;uch, that it could hardly admit any legal proof of a murderous intention. Ovid has briefly and forcibly &s;tated the circum&s;tance to which I allude:
<Q><L>Daedalus invidit, &s;acraque ex arce Minervae</L>
<L>Praecipitem mi&s;it, lap&s;um mentitus.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="209">The poet adds, that the falling youth was metamorpho&s;ed into a par|tridge by the pity of Minerva; and I confe&s;s that I con&s;ider the meta|morpho&s;is and the murder as equally fabulous.</P>
<P>Every good mind that reflects on the &s;ubject will e&s;teem it hardly po&s;|&s;ible that a man in an elevated rank of life, and ble&s;t him&s;elf with a variety of talents, could be induced to murder a promi&s;ing youth whom he had engaged to in&s;truct, and the child of his own &s;i&s;ter, for di&s;play|ing &s;uch ingenuity as a ma&s;ter and a relation would be naturally di&s;|po&s;ed to admire and encourage. A fact of this complexion ought, for the honour of human nature, never to be admitted, except in ca&s;es where the evidence that &s;upports it is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>For the glory of Daedalus we may affirm, that the improbable atro|city imputed to him is &s;o far from being proved by any te&s;timony, that it re&s;ts only on dark tradition; and the whole &s;tory has &s;o much the air of a fable, that it ought long ago to have been di&s;countenanced and di&s;|carded by every &s;erious biographer of this illu&s;trious arti&s;t. Yet writers are &s;o apt to tran&s;cribe the wonderful tales of their predece&s;&s;ors without examination, or to credit enormities a&s;cribed to men of talents and di&s;|tinction, that this barbarous &s;tory has been credulou&s;ly repeated from age to age. The modern and enlightened authors who have recently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the hi&s;tory of Daedalus do not &s;cruple to paint him as an a&s;|&s;ai&s;in. The Abb&eacute; Gedoyn endeavours to varni&s;h his own cruel credu|lity on this &s;ubject by the following remark: <Q>De tout tems une ba&s;&s;e jalou&s;ie a &eacute;t&eacute; le vice des arti&s;ans, m&ecirc;me de ceux qui font profe&s;&s;ion des arts les plus nobles; j'en pourrois citer plu&s;ieurs exemples en France, comme ailleurs.</Q></P>

At all events I have a plea&s;ure in per&s;uading my&s;elf that he was as clearly in|nocent as he was confe&s;&s;edly ingenious. When he removed from At|tica, whatever the cau&s;e of that removal might be, he is &s;aid to have obtained the friend&s;hip of Minos, the &s;econd of that name, who reigned in Crete; and to have executed, in wood, two &s;tatues of Phae|dra and Ariadne, the celebrated daughters of the Cretan monarch. In Crete he is reported to have built a labyrinth of marvellous intricacy, and copied, on a &s;maller &s;cale, from a portentous edifice of Aegypt. He mu&s;t have &s;tudied, therefore, the works of Aegyptian art in their own country, before his vi&s;it to Crete. The Cretans were ever re|markable for their gro&s;s deviation from truth; and the narrative of &s;ome &s;culptural works a&s;cribed to Daedalus, in their i&s;land, contains the mo&s;t filthy and di&s;gu&s;ting fable that ever &s;ullied the pages of fiction. The reader acquainted with mythology will immediately perceive that I allude to the fable of Pa&s;iphae, the mo&s;t cruelly calumniated queen that ever &s;uffered from the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of fancy. Some decent in|terpreters of her &s;tory have &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he was enamoured of a Cretan officer who bore the name of Taurus, and that Daedalus was employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their illicit attachment: but Lucian, with an ad|mirable mixture of wit and good-nature, imagines the Taurus of Pa&s;i|phae's
<PB N="204" REF="211">
affection to have been merely the &s;ign of the zodiac di&s;tingui&s;hed by that appellation; and Deadalus is very happily metamorpho&s;ed, by this &s;uppo&s;ition, from the culpable confident of a di&s;honourable intrigue, into an innocent ma&s;ter of a&s;tronomy. But however blamele&s;s the intercour&s;e might be between the &s;landered Pa&s;iphae and the inge|nious Athenian, Daedalus appears to have incurred the re&s;entment of the Cretan monarch, and to have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;caping from his dominion with &s;ecret rapidity. Hence aro&s;e the fable of his inventing wings for him&s;elf and his &s;on Icarus; a fable &s;o captivating to the fancy of the Latin poets, that Ovid has related it twice at con|&s;iderable length<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Metamorph. lib. viii. Artis Amatoriae, lib.ii.</NOTE>. Virgil has embelli&s;hed it in a few ver&s;es of &s;ingular delicacy and pathos. Horace, Silius Italicus, and Au&s;onius have all mentioned it occa&s;ionally. The ancient and &s;en&s;ible interpreter of in|credible fictions, Palaephatus, has turned the fabulous wings of Daeda|lus and his &s;on into &s;ails. He a&s;&s;erts, that being impri&s;oned by Minos, they e&s;caped from a window of their pri&s;on, and embarked in a &s;kiff: but being pur&s;ued by the ve&s;&s;els of Minos, in tempe&s;tuous weather, the father only got &s;afe to land and completed his e&s;cape. Apollodorus relates that Hercules found the body of Icarus ca&s;t a&s;hore upon an i&s;land, to which he gave the name of Icaria, in honour of the youth, whom he buried. The &s;ame author adds, that Daedalus rewarded his illu&s;tri|ous friend for this humanity &s;hewn to his unfortunate child, by exe|cuting a &s;tatue of Hercules, which that hero mi&s;taking in the night, for a living figure, is &s;aid to have &s;truck with a &s;tone. Pau&s;anias men|tions this &s;tatue as pre&s;erved by the Thebans in a temple of Hercules, and gives a &s;imilar account of its origin as a tribute of gratitude from the afflicted father, who&s;e e&s;cape from Crete he al&s;o a&s;cribes, like Pa|laephatus, to the u&s;e of &s;ails.

Le premier de ces tableaux repr&eacute;&s;entoit le commencement de la dan&s;e, qui &s;e mouvoit en cercle comme pour s'e&s;&s;ayer; le Co|ryph&eacute;e avec &s;a compagne entonnoit la chan&s;on qui en &eacute;toit le motif, et que le re&s;te des dan&s;eurs r&eacute;p&eacute;toit.

As it was the favourite amu&s;ement of Ari&s;tophanes to ridicule the tragic poets of his country, perhaps his Daedalus con|tained little more than a ludicrous parody on the Prometheus of Ae&s;chylus. However this might be, the name of Daedalus appears to have been generally honoured by the poets of Greece; and I ha&s;ten to conclude this attempt to elucidate and confirm his reputation with the words of a Greek epigram, that repre&s;ent him as a paragon of ex|cellence:

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XIV. Ver. 316.</HI> And blam'd the mean abu&s;e of mental power.</HEAD>
<P>Anthermus, a &s;culptor in the i&s;land of Chios, had two &s;ons of his own profe&s;&s;ion, Bupalus and Athenis. The brothers became famous by works of con&s;iderable merit in their art; and &s;till more &s;o by their degrading it into an in&s;trument of malevolence again&s;t the poet Hippo|nax. This animated but ill-favoured bard, di&s;tingui&s;hed by mental ta|lents and per&s;onal deformity, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in love with the daughter of Bupalus, who, to prevent a connexion that he di&s;liked, is &s;aid to have exhibited a caricatura of the formidable lover. The exa&s;|perated poet retaliated by a &s;atire of &s;uch &s;everity again&s;t the offending &s;culptors, that, according to tradition, it made them frantic, and im|pelled them to &s;uicide&mdash;a &s;tory which, as Pliny ju&s;tly ob&s;erves upon it, was &s;ufficiently refuted by their &s;ub&s;equent productions.</P>
<P>Their caricature of Hipponax (perhaps the fir&s;t caricature upon re|cord) is &s;uppo&s;ed by D'Hancarville to have &s;ugge&s;ted to The&s;pis, their contemporary, the idea of furni&s;hing his actors with a ma&s;k, in&s;tead of colouring their faces with vermilion. The &s;atire of the vindictive poet, though we may hope it did not produce the horrible effect a&s;cribed to it, appears to have given celebrity to its indignant author. The Greek Anthologia contains no le&s;s than four in&s;criptions on this powerful &s;a|tiri&s;t. I have &s;elected the two be&s;t of them, for the amu&s;ement of my reader:</P>

<P>Hipponax was a native of Ephe&s;us, and he is celebrated by Athenaeus as the inventor of parody: but his title to that invention is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure controverted by the Abb&eacute; Sallier, in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Origin and Character of Parody, in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Bayle has an article on Hipponax, in which he has collected many curious examples of per&s;ons who have &s;uffered from the dangerous &s;e|verity of literary vengeance. The enmity between the &s;culptor of Chios and the Ephe&s;ian &s;atiri&s;t will probably recall to the recollection of
<PB N="220" REF="227">
an Engli&s;h reader the &s;imilar enmity between tho&s;e bitter and powerful antagoni&s;ts, Hogarth and Churchill.</P>
<P>From the &s;light fragments that remain of Hipponax, I am inclined to believe that his Satires, celebrated as they have been, were inferior in genius, and perhaps in acrimony, to the vindictive performance of the Engli&s;h poet, which contains &s;o many beautiful pa&s;&s;ages, (beautiful both in &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion,) that although good-nature mu&s;t wi&s;h the quarrel which produced it had never exi&s;ted, the poem is &s;till admi|rable as a ma&s;terpiece of poetical indignation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE I. Ver. 38.</HI> A THIRST for prai&s;e, and panting for the goal.</HEAD>
<P>I follow the authority of Cicero, Vitruvius, and Quintilian in nam|ing Myron as the earlie&s;t of the more accompli&s;hed Grecian &s;culptors, who acquired infinite celebrity by making near approaches to perfection in their art. Pau&s;anias &s;peaks of Myron as an Athenian: but Pliny affirms that he was born at Eleutherae, (a city of Baeotia,) and a di&s;|ciple of Agelades, an arti&s;t of Argos. The Bacchus of Myron is &s;aid by Pau&s;anias to have excelled all his other productions, except his &s;tatue of Erectheus at Athens: but this very diligent arti&s;t appears to have ex|ecuted many works of con&s;iderable excellence, and to have been mo&s;t commended for what he probably regarded as a trifling performance. I allude to his famous heifer of bra&s;s, celebrated by no le&s;s than thirty-&s;ix epigrams in the Greek Anthologia; upon which the French &s;culptor

Falconet &s;ays, with &s;ome plea&s;antry and &s;ome ju&s;tice, <Q>Les Atheniens &eacute;toient les Fran&ccedil;ois de la Gr&egrave;ce, et devoient faire autant de jolis vers &s;ur un vache que nous en avons faits &s;ur la chatte en &s;culpture de Madame de Le&s;digui&egrave;res<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Traduction des 34, 35, et 36 Livres de Pline, avec des Notes par Etienne Falconet, tom. i. p. 85.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I ought, however, to ob&s;erve, for the credit of Athens, that the&s;e epigrams are far from having been all produced by her citizens. They form, altogether, &s;uch a heap of in&s;ipid compliments as would not, I think, have appeared very flattering to an arti&s;t of Attic genius. The following, I believe, is one of the be&s;t of them:</P>

<P>As to the general merit of Polycletus, the words of the intelligent Strabo give a very high idea of it, where he &s;ays that the &s;tatues of this arti&s;t were in technical excellence mo&s;t beautiful; but, in high fini&s;hing and magnificence, inferior to tho&s;e of Phidias<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">. <BIBL>STRABO, p. 571.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cicero has al&s;o mentioned the works of Polycletus as examples of perfection: <Q>Nondum Myronis &s;atis ad veritatem adducta, jam tamen quae non dubites pulchra dicere. Pulchriora etiam Polycleti, et jam plane perfecta, ut mihi quidem videri &s;olet.</Q></P>
<P>In his orations again&s;t Verres, the Roman orator expatiates on the extreme beauty of two bronze figures, the celebrated Canephorae of Polycletus; and Winkelman, in his Monumenti inediti, (No. 182.) has engraved, from a bas-relief in terra-cotta, two Athenian virgins that he &s;uppo&s;es to have been copied from the&s;e favourite &s;tatues.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable performance of Polycletus was his Juno of Argos, or rather of Mycenae, according to the local de&s;cription which Strabo has given of her temple. This admired &s;tatue is de&s;cribed by

<P>The talents and reputation of Phidias were &s;o great, that they are allowed to form the mo&s;t honourable aera in the hi&s;tory of art. The Abb&eacute; Gedoyn has added to his hi&s;tory of Daedalus an account of this his mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;ucce&s;&s;or, for the &s;ake of di&s;playing at once, in the lives of the&s;e two memorable men, the commencement and the per|fection of &s;culpture.

<P>The rival arti&s;ts contended in forming a Minerva of bronze for the city. The mo&s;t beautiful figure was to be cho&s;en, and &s;tationed on a lofty column. The two &s;tatues were produced.

<P>Such is the amu&s;ing &s;tory of Tzetzes. What degree of &s;erious credit it may de&s;erve I leave to the judgment of my reader, and ha&s;ten to no|tice the two mo&s;t celebrated works of Phidias; his more magnificent Minerva, &s;tationed as the patrone&s;s of Athens in her temple called Parthenon; and the &s;tatue extolled as the ma&s;terpiece of antiquity, his Olympian Jupiter at Elis.</P>
<P>Pau&s;anias de&s;cribes this Minerva as an upright figure, with a garment de&s;cending to her feet. He does not mention her height; but M. de Caylus, from the expre&s;&s;ion of Pliny, (cubitorum viginti &s;ex,) e&s;timates it at thirty-nine feet, of the French mea&s;ure. <Q>The co&s;tly &s;plendor of the &s;tatue,</Q> &s;ays Winkelman, <Q>may be conceived from the quan|tity of gold employed in its decoration. This, as we learn from a
<PB N="240" REF="246">
&s;peech of Pericles pre&s;erved in Thucydides, amounted to forty ta|lents; the drapery was of gold, and the uncovered parts of the figure formed of ivory.</Q> The latter material was al&s;o employed in the head of Medu&s;a that appeared on the brea&s;t of the godde&s;s, according to the de&s;cription of Pau&s;anias; and perhaps gold and ivory were united in the image of Victory of four cubits, that was placed in one of her hands; though its po&s;ition is not a&s;certained by Pau&s;anias, who only &s;ays that in her hand &s;he held a &s;pear. But the &s;maller figure of Vic|tory that was frequently added as a decoration to a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, and di&s;played in the extended hand of the triumphant divinity, was &s;ome|times of &s;olid gold, as we may conjecture from the profane je&s;t of Dio|ny&s;ius, the tyrant of Syracu&s;e, who, in &s;tealing &s;uch figures, &s;aid it would be folly not to take from the gods what they appeared to offer.&mdash; But to return to the Minerva of Phidias. Pliny &s;ays that on the promi|nent &s;ide of her &s;hield the battle of the Amazons was repre&s;ented; and in the concave part, the conflict between the giants and the gods. Nay, even her &s;andals were decorated, according to his account, with the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithae.</P>
<P>M. de Caylus has ventured to critici&s;e, with a becoming &s;pirit, the&s;e minute decorations:</P>
<Q><P>Apr&egrave;s avoir remerci&eacute; Pline de nous avoir con&s;erv&eacute; ces details, qui ne &s;e trouvent dans aucun autre auteur, on' me trouv&euml;ra &s;ans doute hardi, et peut-&ecirc;tre temeraire, d'o&s;er de&s;approuver ces petits ouvrages en eux-m&ecirc;mes.

<P>Sculpture is a&s;&s;uredly one of the mo&s;t difficult of the fine arts; yet it is a &s;triking truth that Greece produced &s;everal &s;culptors of the fir&s;t rate, though &s;he could only boa&s;t a &s;ingle Homer. It is al&s;o remark|able, that the Grecian &s;culptors were more numerous than the painters of their country. That intelligent and contemplative ob&s;erver of an|tiquity, M. de Caylus, has had the curio&s;ity to compare their re&s;pective numbers, as far as the narratives of Pau&s;anias and Pliny enabled him to make the compari&s;on. Of the former he &s;ays: <Q>Il ne fait mention que de quinze peintres, tandis qu'il di&s;tingue de la mani&egrave;re la plus claire cent &s;oixante et neuf &s;culpteurs.

<P>Scopas, a native of Paros, is mentioned by Pliny as a contemporary with Myron and Polycletus, in the 87th Olympiad. He is repre&s;ented al&s;o, by the &s;ame author, and by Vitruvius, as one of the eminent arti&s;ts employed by the magnificent Artemi&s;ia in decorating the monu|ment of her hu&s;band Mau&s;olus.</P>
<P>But as a &s;culptor, who lived &s;o early, could hardly have been living at the time when that &s;umptuous monument was rai&s;ed, Winkelman conjectures that more than one arti&s;t was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Scopas. It &s;eems rather more probable that Pliny was mi&s;taken in the period he a&s;&s;igned to this admirable &s;culptor; and indeed the chronology of almo&s;t all the ancient arti&s;ts, and their mo&s;t memorable works, is &s;o full of perplexities and contradiction, that mi&s;takes of this kind are almo&s;t unavoidable in a cur&s;ory view of their productions.</P>
<P>The works of Scopas &s;eem to have been full of fancy and feeling; yet it is not ea&s;y to form an exact idea of his three &s;tatues, repre&s;enting the variations of Love, as they are briefly de&s;cribed by Pau&s;anias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. The commentator on Pau&s;anias, to elucidate the&s;e three Greek titles of Cupid, refers his reader to the Grecian Phurnutus "De Natura Deorum:" but on con&s;ulting Phurnutus, I find no light, but rather the "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible" of ridiculous etymologies.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>M. de Caylus imagines that the&s;e Nereids, riding on their &s;ea-hor&s;es, were executed in bas-relief. Falconet is of a different opinion. It is, however, probable that they were &s;o, and that they are &s;till pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>I have &s;een admirable &s;ketches of &s;uch Nereids as an&s;wer to Pliny's de&s;cription, executed at Rome by Mr. Howard, an Engli&s;h arti&s;t, who has the rare talent of drawing from &s;culpture with &s;uch preci&s;ion and delicacy, that England may &s;oon &s;urpa&s;s other countries in a ju&s;t and graceful repre&s;entation of tho&s;e ancient &s;tatues which her men of for|tune and ta&s;te have collected; e&s;pecially as the Dilettanti Society have judiciou&s;ly confided to this arti&s;t the conduct of &s;uch a work, peculiarly calculated to di&s;play his abilities, and to reflect an honour on their own in&s;titution. It is much to be lamented, that almo&s;t all the prints, de|&s;igned to illu&s;trate the many voluminous and co&s;tly books upon &s;culpture, are rather caricatures of ancient art, than a faithful copy of its per|fections.</P>
<P>But to return to the ancient arti&s;t who&s;e works are the immediate &s;ub|ject of this note.&mdash;Pliny has very highly prai&s;ed a Venus by Scopas, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;aid that it excelled the Gnidian Venus of Praxiteles, which he had ju&s;t celebrated as the mo&s;t beautiful &s;tatue to be found on earth. Falconet, with his u&s;ual petulance, derides Pliny for &s;o gro&s;s a contradiction; and even his liberal friend and admirer, M. de Caylus, laments this &s;triking incon&s;i&s;tency. Let me hazard
<PB N="252" REF="258">
what appears to me a probable conjecture, to &s;ave the credit of an author to whom the lovers of art have infinite obligation. I am per|&s;uaded that all the blame which Pliny has incurred for this &s;uppo&s;ed contradiction aro&s;e &s;olely from a &s;lip of the pen in the original manu|&s;cript: but to elucidate the point, I mu&s;t tran&s;cribe the pa&s;&s;age as it &s;tands, and add the new reading I wi&s;h to introduce: <Q>Praeterea Ve|nus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidiam antecedens, et quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</Q>&mdash;According to the pre&s;ent reading, there is not only a contradiction of what he had ju&s;t a&s;&s;erted concerning the pre-eminence of the Gnidian &s;tatue, but the latter part of the &s;entence has little or no meaning. By the following &s;light change in the orthography the ab&s;urd contradiction will be utterly re|moved, and a &s;ignificant &s;pirit will appear in the clo&s;e of the &s;entence: <Q>Praeterea Venus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidi <HI>non</HI> antecedens, <HI>at</HI> quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</Q>&mdash;<Q>A naked Venus, not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, indeed, that of Praxiteles at Gnidos, but &s;uch as would ennoble any other place.</Q></P>
<P>Pliny mentions it as a doubt, in his age, whether the Niobe at Rome is the work of Praxiteles or of Scopas. M. de Caylus makes a plea&s;ant remark on the mode&s;ty of the Roman author, and recommends it as a le&s;&s;on to modern connoi&s;&s;eurs:</P>
<Q>On doit lui &s;avoir gr&eacute; de l'aveu de &s;on ignorance &s;ur le nom des auteurs des ouvrages, qui decoroient la ville de Rome.

<P>Among the impa&s;&s;ioned works of Scopas, his Bacchanal was parti|cularly admired. Junius, in his account of this arti&s;t, has in&s;erted two Greek epigrams from the Anthologia, in prai&s;e of the figure to which I allude: but there is a third epigram, by Paulus Silentiarius,
<PB N="253" REF="259">
(one of the be&s;t among the late writers in that motley collection!) which was probably compo&s;ed on the &s;ame &s;tatue, and which I prefer to the two epigrams cited by Junius. It runs thus:

<P>There is a very pompous eulogy on the Bacchanal of Scopas in that &s;ingular little work, De&s;criptions of Fourteen Ancient Statues, in Greek pro&s;e, by Calli&s;tratus. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that two &s;uch &s;cholars as Meur|&s;ius and Olearius could &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e de&s;criptions to be written by the very Calli&s;tratus whom Demo&s;thenes attended, with delight, as his ma&s;ter in eloquence. They rather &s;eem the production of &s;ome trifling and declamatory &s;ophi&s;t, of a much later period. The de&s;cription of the Bacchanal clo&s;es, however, with a high compliment to the genius of Scopas; as it a&s;&s;erts that his &s;culpture di&s;played that &s;ort of energy and &s;pirit which characteri&s;ed the orations of Demo&s;thenes. Olearius, who publi&s;hed Calli&s;tratus in his excellent edition of the two Philo&s;trati, &s;uppo&s;es this compari&s;on of the &s;culptor with the orator to have been added to the original de&s;cription by &s;ome later hand.

<P>This eminent arti&s;t, like his predece&s;&s;or Phidias, and many of the Greeks, was doubly di&s;tingui&s;hed as an architect and a &s;culptor. Per|haps he was employed in both capacities on the magnificent tomb of Mau&s;olus, a work celebrated by many writers of antiquity as one of the &s;even wonders of the world, and ingeniou&s;ly illu&s;trated by M. de Caylus, in a di&s;&s;ertation on its form and dimen&s;ions, which the curious reader may find in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Five arti&s;ts of di&s;tinction were engaged in this &s;tupendous &s;tructure, which ro&s;e to the height of an hundred and forty feet, including what crowned the &s;ummit&mdash;a triumphal chariot of marble! The columns that &s;urrounded the lower part of the fabric amounted to thirty-&s;ix, compri&s;ing its four fronts. Tho&s;e to the &s;outh and north were more exten&s;ive than the other two. The ea&s;tern a&s;pect was a&s;&s;igned to the conduct of Scopas. The monument is doubly remarkable as a work of magnificent expen&s;e and of genuine affection. The fair &s;overeign of Caria was &s;o &s;incere a mourner, that &s;he is &s;aid to have died literally of grief for the lo&s;t Mau&s;olus before his &s;umptuous monument could be completed. She had, however, &s;ufficient energy of character to act as a heroine after his de|cea&s;e; and Vitruvius records an anecdote of her prowe&s;s which I am induced to mention, as it &s;hews, in a very forcible light, the veneration paid by the ancients to the &s;tatues erected under the au&s;pices of Victory.</P>
<P>The Rhodians, who were &s;ubject to Mau&s;olus, rebelled again&s;t his widow Artemi&s;ia. The indignant queen, by a very bold &s;tratagem, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their city, and rai&s;ed in it, as a trophy of her con|que&s;t,

<P>The glory that Praxiteles acquired from the excellence of his Venus was increa&s;ed by the felicity with which he executed more than one &s;tatue of Cupid. The orations of Cicero again&s;t Verres have given ce|lebrity to the marble Cupid, which the orator repre&s;ents as a rival to one &s;till more famous, by the &s;ame arti&s;t, that formed the pride and the wealth of the The&s;pians&mdash;a &s;tatue &s;pared by Mummius, when he plun|dered the cities of Greece. The rapacious Verres had robbed an in|genious and friendly Sicilian of a &s;imilar exqui&s;ite and invaluable work of art, which Cicero de&s;cribes as the production of Praxiteles.

<P>To return to the Cupid of Praxiteles.&mdash;The &s;culptor Falconet has cen|&s;ured his countryman, M. de Jaucourt, for in&s;erting in the French En|cyclopedia an anecdote relating to this celebrated &s;tatue, told on the au|thority of the pre&s;ident de Thou. The &s;tory &s;ays that the March|ione&s;s of Mantua po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the year 1573, the Cupid of Praxiteles, and the &s;leeping Cupid of Michael Angelo; and that de Thou, with other gue&s;ts of the Marchione&s;s, were charmed with the work of the modern arti&s;t, till they compared it with a &s;uperior work of antiquity that &s;eemed to annihilate its merit. The &s;tory is certainly improbable in many points of view; and Falconet exults in producing what he con&s;iders as a proof that the fact was impo&s;&s;ible: I mean, the te&s;timony of Pau&s;anias, declaring that the famous Cupid of Praxiteles, a &s;tatue of marble, and the idol of the The&s;pians, peri&s;hed (after a variety of ad|ventures) in a fire at Rome. The evidence of Pau&s;anias &s;ufficiently proves, indeed, the fate of the The&s;pian &s;tatue, but it does not amount to a proof that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Marchione&s;s of Mantua to po&s;&s;e&s;s a Cupid executed by Praxiteles; becau&s;e we have already &s;een that there exi&s;ted two marble Cupids of acknowledged beauty, by this illu&s;trious &s;culptor; and among the &s;tatues de&s;cribed by Calli&s;tratus, two Cupids, by the &s;ame arti&s;t, in bronze, are celebrated as works of ex|qui&s;ite

Even this number has rather a marvellous &s;ound: but the fol|lowing intelligent remarks of M. de Caylus, on this &s;ubject, are &s;uffi|cient to &s;atisfy readers, not familiar with the proce&s;s of this admirable art, that the multitude of bronzes a&s;cribed to Ly&s;ippus is far from ex|ceeding the limits of credibility; though Pliny has mentioned them in &s;uch terms as might produce, without the explanation of experience, only incredulous a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>

<P>I have &s;een it &s;omewhere ob&s;erved, that a &s;tatue, re&s;embling the di|minutive Hercules of Ly&s;ippus, was formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the celebrated Pithou, who has been called the Varro of France: but I apprehend that intere&s;ting work of ancient art has long cea&s;ed to exi&s;t; and as the animated poem, in which Statius has de&s;cribed the &s;tatue and its mo&s;t amiable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, has not appeared (to my recollection) in our language, I &s;hall conclude this note with an entire ver&s;ion of the Latin epi&s;tle I allude to, as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing tribute that antiquity has paid to the talents of Ly&s;ippus.</P>

<P>M. de Caylus clo&s;es one of his Di&s;cour&s;es on the Sculpture of the Ancients, in the Memoirs of the French Academy, with a circum&s;tantial account of the Rhodian Colo&s;&s;us, collected from the authors of remote and recent times who have occa&s;ionally mentioned this mo&s;t magnificent of all colo&s;&s;al figures, the memorable production of a little i&s;land once ennobled by the united influence of liberty, art, and naval power! Yet, after the re&s;earches of an accompli&s;hed writer, on a &s;ub|ject &s;o attractive to his fancy, we mu&s;t &s;till remain in ignorance of &s;ome particulars relating to this intere&s;ting image, that a lover of the arts would be glad to a&s;certain. Much, however, is known. Pliny has de&s;cribed the fragments of this Colo&s;&s;us in clear and animated lan|guage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ante onines autem in admiratione &s;uit Solis Colo&s;&s;us Rhodi, quem fecerat Chares Lin|dins, Ly&s;ippi &s;upra dicti di&s;cipulus.

The Greek epigram, containing its dimen&s;ions, varies (ac|cording to different readings) from &s;eventy to eighty cubits. M. de Caylus, forming his calculation from the expre&s;&s;ion of Pliny, that few men could embrace the thumb, concludes that the height of the per|fect &s;tatue was about an hundred and five feet.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="287">We learn from Strabo that it was broken a&s;under at the knees, and that the Rhodians con&s;idered them&s;elves as prohibited by an oracle from replacing it. They probably guarded the fragments with a religious veneration. I know not otherwi&s;e how to account for a very &s;urpri&s;ing fact, which my decea&s;ed friend Gibbon has recorded with his u&s;ual elegance and energy of expre&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erves, that <Q>after &s;tanding fifty-&s;ix years, the Colo&s;&s;us of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake: but the ma&s;&s;y trunk and huge fragments lay &s;cat|tered eight centuries on the ground.</Q> I cannot tran&s;cribe the words of an accompli&s;hed author, who&s;e memory is &s;o ju&s;tly dear to me, with|out reflecting, with poignant regret, what infinite advantages, for the improvement of my pre&s;ent work, I might have derived from his ta&s;te, knowledge, and kindne&s;s, had his life been extended according to my wi&s;hes. Gibbon, though he was not a collector of &s;tatues or pictures, had a lively e&s;teem for all the fine arts.</P>
<P>I return to the Rhodian Apollo.&mdash;If we may tru&s;t the Byzantine writers, Theophanes and Con&s;tantine, the bra&s;s of this Colo&s;&s;us was gilt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.&mdash;CONSTANT. de Admini&s;.

The Saracen chief, who invaded Rhodes in the year 672, &s;eized and tran&s;ported this ponderous plunder into Syria, where it was publicly &s;old to a Jew of Ede&s;&s;a. The &s;tory of loading nine hundred camels with the weight of the&s;e &s;tupendous relies has the air of an Arabian tale. M. de Caylus imagines that modern writers have fallen into a great mi&s;take concerning the attitude and the &s;tation of the &s;tanding Colo&s;&s;us, by repre&s;enting it as a &s;triding figure at the entrance of the port, as the reader may have &s;een it in ordinary prints, with ve&s;|&s;els failing between its legs.

<P>The learned and enthu&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;torian of ancient art, in noticing its migration from the de&s;olated cities of Greece into Syria and Aegypt, remarks, that being employed to &s;erve the pomp and pageantry of courts, it lo&s;t an infinite portion of its grandeur and genius under the Seleucides and the Ptolemies.

<P>Is not this paying rather too high a compliment to the Egyptian mo|narch? He was, however, a patron of art, and a lover of magnifi|cence.

<P>Ptolemy was &s;o fond of the arts and of his queen, that he is &s;aid to have projected a temple to her memory, &s;o vaulted with load&s;tone, as to keep a metallic &s;tatue of Ar&s;inoe &s;u&s;pended in the air; a project which the death of his famous architect Dimocrates is &s;uppo&s;ed to have defeated!

In marrying his daughter to Antiochus king of Syria, Ptolemy had affectionately conducted the bride to Seleucia; and being charmed by a magnificent &s;tatue of Diana, he received it as a pre&s;ent from his &s;on-in-law, and tran&s;ported it to Alexandria: but Ar&s;inoe falling &s;ick on its arrival, &s;aw, in her troubled dreams, the offended godde&s;s, who complained of being removed from her Syrian temple.

<P>Winkelmann, in &s;peaking of the arts at the court of Seleucia, a&s;&s;erts that the Grecian &s;culptors who migrated into A&s;ia &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, in their works, &s;uch of their brethren as remained in their own country; and he quotes the la&s;t character of Theophra&s;tus in proof of this a&s;&s;ertion.

<HEAD><HI>NOTE VI. Ver. 116.</HI> Their works &s;he blindly prais'd and ba&s;ely &s;tole.</HEAD>
<P>Nothing could exceed the inaptitude of the Romans to excell in the art of &s;culpture, except the rapacity with which they &s;eized the &s;tatues of the various nations who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in ingenuity.</P>
<P>Their public ravages of this kind were often followed by petty acts of barbari&s;m and ba&s;ene&s;s &s;till more dete&s;table; for, not contented with having carried off the monuments of public merit from the countries they overcame, they era&s;ed in&s;criptions from the &s;tatues of illu&s;trious men, and in&s;erted fal&s;e titles of their own. On this occa&s;ion it is ju&s;|tice to exclaim with Cicero, "Odi fal&s;as in&s;criptiones &s;tatuarum aliena|rum."</P>
<P>The learned Figrelius, who has written at length on the &s;tatues of the Romans, relates &s;ome curious examples of this &s;culptural forgery. It appears, from the authority of Dio Chry&s;o&s;tom, that Alcibiades was turned into Aenobarbus; and according to Zonaras, even Con&s;tantine the Great did not &s;cruple to put his own name on a &s;tatue of Apollo: but if he did &s;o, we may hope it was rather to annihilate the wor&s;hip he condemned, than to impo&s;e the figure of a Pagan divinity on the people as the real repre&s;entative of a Chri&s;tian emperor.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the Romans it is proper to remark, that they might po&s;|&s;ibly learn from the Greeks them&s;elves the di&s;ingenuous practice of fal&s;i|fying the &s;tatues of ancient worthies. We know that Rhodes (one of the mo&s;t magnificent marts of &s;culpture in the Pagan world!) incurred con&s;iderable di&s;grace by this &s;pecies of fal&s;ehood, for which Dio Chry&s;o&s;|tom reproves the Rhodians in a very copious, animated, and beautiful

<P>The learned and judicious Ca&s;aubon joins with Photius in pro|nouncing this the be&s;t of all Dio's orations, and gives the following ju&s;t account of the orator's intentions:</P>
<Q>Tam prolixa oratione hoc unum agit; ut Rhodiorum &s;enatui ac populo morem di&s;&s;uadeat, qui apud eos obtinuerat, &s;tatuas veteres transferendi ad aliorum honorem titulis mutatis, &s;urdo figurarum di&s;crimine.

<P>There is another oration of Dio relating to &s;culpture, and particu|larly entertaining. The orator with great dexterity expre&s;&s;es his &s;ur|pri&s;e, to the inhabitants of Corinth, that a brazen &s;tatue of him&s;elf, with which they had honoured him on his former vi&s;it, (about eleven years before,) had vani&s;hed from their city&mdash;a &s;ubject of great delicacy, and very gracefully treated, particularly in the clo&s;e of the oration.</P>

The nature of tho&s;e &s;poils, and the future con&s;equences of &s;uch conduct, are finely de&s;cribed in the following words of Livy:</P>

<P>The triumphant &s;plendor of ancient Rome &s;eems to have dazzled even the philo&s;ophical &s;pirits of antiquity, and to have &s;truck them blind to the predominant vices of her national character.

they form the characteri&s;tics of a nation. Yet &s;o fa&s;cinating is the pride of &s;ucce&s;sful valour, that the nation of antiquity mo&s;t injurious in its conduct towards the re&s;t of the world is often commended as an object for modern emulation. The mo&s;t flagrant enormities of which the go|vernors of France (both regal and republican) have been guilty, &s;eem to have been greatly owing to an indi&s;criminate and fanta&s;tic imitation of Roman &s;pirit; with a prepo&s;terous pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes concealed, and &s;ometimes avowed, for univer&s;al dominion. The French appear to believe the Romans to have been what they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be&mdash; a divine race of men, de&s;tined by &s;uperior virtue to &s;ubdue the other nations of the earth; or, to u&s;e the words of their elegant but &s;ervile flatterer Virgil:

<P>Herodes Atticus, the munificent citizen of Athens, was the accom|pli&s;hed &s;on of a mo&s;t fortunate father;&mdash;a father, who had not only the rare good fortune to di&s;cover, and obtain permi&s;&s;ion from the empe|ror Nerva to appropriate to his own family a concealed and inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure, but the higher good fortune to find, and &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivate, in his child, tho&s;e talents and virtues which, in&s;tead of being corrupted by unbounded opulence, rather appeared to derive from it new energy and lu&s;tre. Herodes Atticus became not only the riche&s;t &s;ubject in the Roman empire, but he was at the &s;ame time one of the mo&s;t &s;tudious, the mo&s;t eloquent, and liberal of men. It was his noble maxim, that the wealthy ought to employ their riches, not only in relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor, but in &s;aving tho&s;e of narrow circum&s;tances from &s;inking into poverty. Pau&s;anias, who lived at the &s;ame period, has &s;poken with plea&s;ure of the magnificent gifts be&s;towed by this generous Athenian on different parts of Greece. The mo&s;t remarkable were, the Stadium that he formed at Athens, of the fine&s;t marble, extending &s;ix hundred feet; and &s;tatues of &s;ingular beauty and &s;plendor, with which he decorated the temple of Neptune, on the I&s;thmus of Corinth.

<P>A temple (perhaps rather an altar) in Athens, dedicated to Mercy by the de&s;cendants of Hercules, is &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t A&s;ylum. To this the poet Claudian alludes:
<Q><L>&mdash; Flentibus aram,</L>

<P>The A&s;ylum that Romulus e&s;tabli&s;hed in his new city is de&s;cribed in the Second Book of Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is. Ovid thus &s;peaks of it in his Fa&s;ti:

<P>The privileges and the abu&s;es of the ancient A&s;yla, in different countries, have probably been well illu&s;trated by the Abb&eacute; Gua&s;co, in a Treati&s;e which he wrote expre&s;sly on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject; a book that I have &s;ought for, without being &s;o fortunate as to meet with it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XI. Ver. 248.</HI> Rever'd his glory as a public tru&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>Diogenes Laertius a&s;&s;erts, in his Life of Socrates, that the Athenians immediately repented their conduct towards the philo&s;opher, and ho|noured his memory by a public &s;tatue of bra&s;s, the work of Ly&s;ippus! It is remarkable that two men, one e&s;teemed the wi&s;e&s;t, and the other the wittie&s;t of the Greeks, Socrates and Lucian, were bred to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;culpture. The vivacity of Lucian, and his antipathy to a &s;e|vere relation, his ma&s;ter, probably precluded that comic genius from making any con&s;iderable advances in an art which requires the &s;teadie&s;t union of indu&s;try and talent. But Socrates is known to have executed &s;ome works, as a &s;tatuary, that were objects of public regard. Pau|&s;anias has noticed the Graces, in the Acropolis of Athens, as the work of the philo&s;opher; and in ob&s;erving that the&s;e and the elder Golden Graces of Bupalus were not de&s;titute of drapery, he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf unable to di&s;cover what arti&s;t introduced the cu&s;tom, prevalent in his time, of repre&s;enting the Graces naked. Falconet imagines that &s;tatues executed by Socrates could have but a trifling degree of merit as works of art, from the philo&s;opher's having quitted the profe&s;&s;ion very early in life: but the more candid Greeks &s;eem inclined to applaud the laudable endeavours of juvenile talent; and a Greek epigram on a very young &s;culptor, Eutychides, &s;peaks of him as equal to Praxiteles, though cala|mitou&s;ly hurried out of life at the age of &s;ixteen:

<P>Tho&s;e who are amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving the oppo&s;ite extremes into which prejudice and partiality are apt to be hurried in de&s;cribing the &s;ame author, may be gratified in comparing what the French &s;culptor Fal|conet, and his countryman M. de la Nauze, have &s;aid, one to depreciate, and the other to magnify, the merits of Pliny as a writer upon art. Perhaps the &s;pirit of that indefatigable and illu&s;trious Roman, if we could que&s;tion him on the &s;ubject, would equally &s;mile at the bitter de|traction and the exaggerated prai&s;e, confe&s;&s;ing ingenuou&s;ly that he really de&s;erved neither the one nor the other. In his great and unfi|ni&s;hed work it is certainly not difficult to find &s;ome con&s;iderable imper|fections; yet taken altogether it is a mo&s;t valuable and glorious monument of indu&s;try, intelligence, and good-nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XXIV. Ver. 460.</HI> And moral beauty decorates the whole.</HEAD>
<P>The Latin folio of Francis Junius De Pictura Veterum is a work of exten&s;ive erudition, and equal philanthropy. The very &s;tudious and amiable author was born in the Palatinate, 1599: he fir&s;t embraced the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, but &s;oon quitted it on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace; and after travelling to France, he vi&s;ited England, and re&s;ided for thirty years in the family of that illu&s;trious lover of art, the celebrated earl of Arundel; a circum&s;tance peculiarly favourable to his elaborate produc|tion. The fir&s;t edition of it was printed in Holland; but the &s;econd, with many additions, and a life of the author by Graevius, was publi&s;hed in London, 1694.</P>
<P>A letter from Grotius, dated Paris, 1638, in returning thanks to Junius for a copy of his book, contains the following judicious and ele|gant de&s;cription of its merit:</P>
<Q><PB N="346" REF="350">Miror diffu&s;am lectionem, judicium, ordinem, &amp; quae ex cunctis artibus ad hanc artem ornandam attuli&s;ti.

<P>Junius died at Wind&s;or, in the hou&s;e of his nephew Vo&s;&s;ius: and the univer&s;ity of Oxford, to whom this mo&s;t mild and laborious &s;cholar bequeathed his books, has honoured his memory with an epitaph that contains the following very plea&s;ing eulogy:

<P>Though the eager enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of Winkelman expo&s;ed him oc|ca&s;ionally to delu&s;ion and to ridicule, there is &s;uch a portion of &s;olid and of &s;plendid merit in his great work, the Hi&s;tory of Art, as can hardly fail to confer upon its author an honourable immortality. The excel|lencies and the failings of this animated writer are candidly di&s;played in the eulogy in&s;cribed to him by his accompli&s;hed friend Heyne, the profe&s;&s;or of Gottingen. In the copious tide of tran&s;lations from the German which has recently enriched the literature of our country, it is matter of &s;urpri&s;e and regret to tho&s;e who delight in the arts, that the works of Winkelman have not yet made their appearance. He has found creditable tran&s;lators both in France and Italy.

He was born at Stendal in Brandenburgh, 1717; and &s;tabbed at Trie&s;te by an itinerant Italian, who vainly hoped to rob him of &s;ome valuable metals that he had received as a pre&s;ent on his vi&s;it to the court of Vienna.</P>

<P>The delight and advantages ari&s;ing from a lively and liberal pa&s;&s;ion for the fine arts were never more forcibly exemplified than in the youthful, and in the declining days, of that accompli&s;hed nobleman the Comte de Caylus. Born of a very illu&s;trious family in 1692, he began his career of public life as a &s;oldier; but on the peace of Ra&s;tadt, he amu&s;ed his active &s;pirit by travelling to Italy. In the cour&s;e of his ex|cur&s;ion, he made a frank offer of his &s;word in defence of Malta, then threatened by the Turks: the alarm of that i&s;land pa&s;&s;ed away, and the count returned to Paris. The love of travelling, and a pa&s;&s;ionate at|tachment to the &s;tudy of antiquities, now induced him to relinqui&s;h his military profe&s;&s;ion. He wi&s;hed to vi&s;it the &s;cenes of ancient art, and
<PB N="349" REF="353">
&s;eized the opportunity of embarking for the ea&s;t with a new emba&s;&s;ador from his country to Con&s;tantinople. As they &s;topt at Smyrna, he was eager to &s;urvey the ruins of Ephe&s;us; their di&s;tance from Smyrna was only the journey of a day. His friends endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from attempting it, by di&s;playing the danger he mu&s;t incur, as the country was infe&s;ted by a mercile&s;s banditti, under a formidable chief, Caracayali.</P>
<P>But in the Comte de Caylus (&s;ays his Eulogi&s;t) fear was always &s;ub|ordinate to de&s;ire. He accompli&s;hed his wi&s;hes by an adventurous de|vice: clothing him&s;elf in a &s;imple linen dre&s;s, and taking with him no|thing that could tempt rapacity, he &s;et forth with two of the banditti, who were &s;uffered, from motives of public apprehen&s;ion, to vi&s;it Smyrna occa&s;ionally. He had made a bargain with the&s;e men, on a promi&s;e of paying them liberally on his &s;afe return. They conducted him, with an interpreter, to their captain. Caracayali, plea&s;ed with his animated vi&s;itor, took a plea&s;ure in gratifying his curio&s;ity. He told him there were ruins &s;till nearer, that de&s;erved his attention; and to convey him thither with the utmo&s;t celerity, he &s;upplied him with two of the fine&s;t Arabian cour&s;ers. The Comte &s;eemed to be tran&s;ported by magic to the intere&s;ting &s;pot: it pre&s;ented to him the ruins of Colopton. After enjoying that unexpected and delightful &s;cene, he returned to pa&s;s the night in a fort that formed the re&s;idence of Caracayali; and the next day he devoted to the ruins of Ephe&s;us. Of the &s;tate in which he found the famous temple of Diana, he has left a memoir: but the nature of my pre&s;ent work does not allow me to dwell on the extended life and numerous productions of this engaging character: I ha&s;ten to &s;peak of his latter days.
