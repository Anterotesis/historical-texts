<HEAD>AN Explanatory Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not that I &s;ee any Rea&s;on to alter my Opinion in any thing I have Writ, which occa&s;ions this Epi|&s;tle; but I find it nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;atisfaction of &s;ome Per&s;ons of Honour, as well as Wit, to pa&s;s a &s;hort Explication upon it, and tell the World what I mean, or rather, what I do not mean, in &s;ome things wherein I find I am liable to be mi&s;-under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my &s;elf &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to hear that I am tax'd with Bewraying my Own Ne&s;t, and Abu&s;ing our Nation, by Di&s;covering the Meanne&s;s of our Original, in order to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> contemptible abroad and at home; in which, I think, they are mi&s;taken: For why &s;hould not our Neighbours be as good as We to Derive from? And I mu&s;t add, That had we been an Unmix'd Nation, I am of Opinion it had been to our Di&s;advantage: For to go on far|ther, we have three Nations about us as clear from Mix|tures of Blood as any in the World, and I know not which of them I could wi&s;h our &s;elves to be like; I mean the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> and if I were to write a Re|ver&s;e to the <HI>Satyr,</HI> I would examine all the Nations of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and prove, That tho&s;e Nations which are mo&s;t mix|ed, are the be&s;t, and have lea&s;t of Barbari&s;m and Brutality among them; and abundance of Rea&s;ons might be given for it, too long to bring into a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>But I give this Hint, to let the World know, that I am far from thinking, 'tis a <HI>Satyr,</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to tell them, They are Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heaven; that is, <HI>from &s;everal Nations</HI> Nor is it meant to undervalue the Original of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for we &s;ee no Rea&s;on to like them the wor&s;e, being the Relicks of <HI>Romans, Danes, Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> than we &s;houl'd ha' done, if they had remain'd <HI>Britains,</HI> that is, <HI>than if they had been all</HI> Wel&s;hmen.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
But the Intent of the <HI>Satyr</HI> is pointed at the Vanity of tho&s;e who talk of their Antiquity, and value them&s;elves up|on their Pedigree, their Ancient Families, and being <HI>True Born;</HI> whereas 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hou'd be <HI>True Born;</HI> and if we could, &s;hou'd have lo&s;t by the Bargain.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ort of People, who Call them&s;elves <HI>True Born,</HI> and tell long Stories of their Families, and like a Nobleman of <HI>Venice, Think a Foreigner ought not to walk on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Street with them,</HI> are own'd to be meant in this <HI>Satyr.</HI> What they would infer from their own Original, I know not, nor is it ea&s;ie to make out whe|ther they are the better, or the wor&s;e for their Ance&s;tors: Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation may Value them&s;elves for their <HI>Wit, Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Courage,</HI> and I believe few will di&s;pute it with them; but for long Originals, and Ancient <HI>True Born</HI> Fa|milies of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I wou'd advi&s;e them to wave the Di&s;|cour&s;e. A <HI>True Engli&s;h</HI> Man is one that de&s;erves a Cha|racter, and I have no where le&s;&s;ened him, that I know of; but as for a <HI>True Born</HI> Engli&s;h Man, I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand him.</P>
<P>From hence I only infer, That an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, of all Men ought not to de&s;pi&s;e Foreigners <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and I think the Inference is ju&s;t, &s;ince <HI>what they are to day, we were ye&s;terday, and to morrow they will be like us.</HI> If Foreigners misbehave in their &s;everal Stations and Employ|ments, <HI>I have nothing to do with that;</HI> the Laws are open to Puni&s;h them equally with Natives, and let them have no Favour.</P>
<P>But when I &s;ee the Town full of Lampoons and Inve|ctives again&s;t <HI>Dutchmen, only becau&s;e they are Foreign|ers,</HI> and the King Reproached and In&s;ulted by In&s;olent Pe|dants, and Ballad-making Poets, for employing Foreigners; and for being a Foreigner him&s;elf, I confe&s;s my &s;elf mov'd by it to remind our Nation of their own Original, thereby to let them &s;ee what a Banter is put upon our &s;elves in it; &s;ince &s;peaking of <HI>Engli&s;hmen ab Origine,</HI> we are really Foreigners our &s;elves.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
I could go on to prove 'tis al&s;o Impolitick in us to di&s;|courage Foreigners; &s;ince 'tis ea&s;ie to make it appear that the multitudes of Foreign Nations who have took Sanctuary here, have been the greate&s;t Additions to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation; the great E&s;&s;ential whereof is the Number of its Inhabitants: Nor would this Nation have ever arriv'd to the Degree of Wealth and Glory, it now boa&s;ts of, if the addition of Foreign Nations, both as to Ma|nufactures and Arms, had not been helpful to it. This is &s;o plain, that he who is ignorant of it, is too dull to be talk|ed with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Satyr</HI> therefore I mu&s;t allow to be ju&s;t, till I am o|therwi&s;e convinc'd; becau&s;e nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear our People boa&s;t of that Antiquity, which if it had been true, would have left us in &s;o much wor&s;e a Con|dition than we are in now: Whereas we ought rather to boa&s;t among our Neighbours, that we are a part of them|&s;elves, or the &s;ame Original as they, but better'd by our Cli|mate, and like our Language and Manufactures, deriv'd from them, and improv'd by us to a Perfection greater than they can pretend to.</P>
<P>This we might have valued our &s;elves upon without Va|nity: But to di&s;own our De&s;cent from them, talking big of our Ancient Families, and long Originals, and &s;tand at a di&s;tance, from Foreigners, like the <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> in Religion, with a <HI>Stand off, I am more holy than thou:</HI> This is a thing &s;o ridiculous, in a Nation deriv'd from Foreigners, as we are, that I could not but attack them as I have done.</P>
<P>And whereas I am threaten'd to be call'd to a Publick Account for this Freedom; and the Publi&s;her of this has been <HI>New-Paper'd</HI> in Goal already for it; tho' I &s;ee no|thing in it for which the Government can be di&s;plea&s;ed; yet, if at the &s;ame time tho&s;e People who with an Unlimited Ar|rogance in Print, every day <HI>Affront the King, Pre&s;cribe the Parliament, and Lampoon the Government,</HI> may be either Puni&s;hed or Re&s;trained, I am content to &s;tand and fall by the Publick Ju&s;tice of my Native Countrey, which I am not &s;en&s;ible I have any where injur'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
Nor would I be mi&s;-under&s;tood concerning the Clergy; with whom if I have taken any Licen&s;e more than becomes a <HI>Satyr,</HI> I que&s;tion not but tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are Men of Letters, are al&s;o Men of &s;o much Candor, as to allow me a Loo&s;e at the Crimes of the Guilty, without thinking the whole Profe&s;&s;ion La&s;h'd, who are Innocent. I profe&s;s to have very mean Thoughts of tho&s;e Gentlemen who have de&s;erted their own Principles, and expos'd even their Morals as well as Loyalty; but not at all to think it affects any but &s;uch as are concern'd in the Fact.</P>
<P>Nor wou'd I be mi&s;-repre&s;ented as to the Ingratitude of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the King and his Friends; as if I meant the <HI>Engli&s;h as a Nation,</HI> are &s;o. The contrary is &s;o apparent, That I wou'd hope it &s;hou'd not be Sugge&s;ted of me: And therefore when I have brought in <HI>Britannia</HI> Speaking of the King, I &s;uppo&s;e Her to be the Repre&s;entative, or Mouth of the Nation, as a Body. But if I &s;ay we are full of &s;uch who daily affront the King, and abu&s;e his Friends; who Print Scurrilous Pamphlets, Virulent Lampoons, and reproachful Publick Banters, again&s;t both the King's Per&s;on and Go|vernment; I &s;ay nothing but what is too true: And that the <HI>Satyr</HI> is directed at &s;uch, I freely own; and cannot &s;ay, but I &s;hou'd think it very hard to be Cen&s;ur'd for this <HI>Satyr,</HI> while &s;uch remain &V;nque&s;tion'd, and tacitly approv'd. That I can mean none but &s;uch, is plain ftom the&s;e few Lines.
<Q><L>Ye Heavens regard! Almighty <HI>Jove,</HI> look down,</L>
<L>And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne.</L>
<L>On their Ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take,</L>
<L>Who &s;ought his Aid, and then his Part for&s;ake.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I have fallen upon our Vices, I hope none but the Vi|cious will be Angery. As for Writing for Intere&s;t, I di&s;|own it; I have neither <HI>Place,</HI> nor <HI>Pen&s;ion,</HI> nor <HI>Pro&s;pect;</HI> nor <HI>&s;eek none,</HI> nor will <HI>have none:</HI> If matter of Fact ju&s;ti|fies the Truth of the Crimes, the <HI>Satyr</HI> is Ju&s;t. As to the Poetick Liberties, I hope the Crime is Pardonable: I am
<PB REF="6">
content to be Ston'd, provided none will Attack me but the Innocent.</P>
<P>If my Country-Men wou'd take the Hint, and grow bet|ter-Natur'd from my <HI>ill-Natur'd Poem,</HI> as &s;ome call it; I would &s;ay this of it, that tho' 'tis far from the be&s;t <HI>Satyr</HI> that ever was Wrote, 'twould do the mo&s;t Good that ever <HI>Satyr</HI> did.</P>
<P>And yet I am ready to ask Pardon of &s;ome Gentlemen too; who tho' they are <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> have good Nature enough to &s;ee them&s;elves Reprov'd, and can bear it. The&s;e are Gentlemen in a true Sence, that can bear to be told of their <HI>Faux Pas,</HI> and not abu&s;e the Reprover. To &s;uch I mu&s;t &s;ay, this is no <HI>Satyr;</HI> they are Exceptions to the Ge|neral Rule; and I value my Performance from their Ge|nerous Approbation, more than I can from any Opinion I have of its Worth.</P>
<P>The ha&s;ty Errors of my Ver&s;e I made my Excu&s;e for, before; and &s;ince the time I have been upon it has been but little, and my Lei&s;ure le&s;s, I have all along &s;trove rather to make the Thoughts Explicite, than the Poem Correct. However, I have mended &s;ome Faults in this Edition, <HI>and the re&s;t mu&s;t be plac'd to my Account.</HI></P>
<P>As to An&s;wers, Banters, <HI>True Engli&s;h Billin&s;gate,</HI> I expect them till no Body will buy, and then the Shop will be &s;hut. Had I wrote it for the Gain of the Pre&s;s, I &s;hould have been concern'd at its being Printed again and again, by <HI>Pyrates,</HI> as they call them, and <HI>Paragraph-Men:</HI> But would They but do it Ju&s;tice, and Print it True, according to the Copy, they are welcome to Sell it for a Penny, if they Plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pence indeed is the End of their Works. I'll engage, if no body will Buy, no body will Write: And not a Patriot-Poet of them all, now will in Defence of his Native Coun|try, <HI>which I have abus'd, they &s;ay,</HI> Print an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to it, and give it about for <HI>Gods-&s;ake.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE End of Satyr is Reformation: And the Au|thor, tho' he doubts the Work of Conver&s;ion is at a General Stop, has put his Hand to the Plow.</P>
<P>I expect a Storm of Ill-Language from the Fury of the Town, and e&s;pecially from tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Talent it is to Rail: And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may venture to foretell, That I &s;hall be Cavil'd at about my <HI>Mean Stile, Rough Ver&s;e,</HI> and <HI>In|correct Language;</HI> things I might indeed have taken more Care in; But the Book is Printed; and tho' I &s;ee &s;ome Faults, 'tis too late to mend them: And this is all I think needful to &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome body may take me for a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> in which they are mi&s;taken: But I am one that would be glad to &s;ee <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> behave them&s;elves better to Strangers, and to Governours al&s;o; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries for belonging to a <HI>Nation that wants Manners.</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Strangers u&s;e us better Abroad; and we can give no rea&s;on but our Ill-Na|ture for the contrary here.</P>
<P>Methinks an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who is &s;o Proud of being call'd <HI>A Goodfellow,</HI> &s;hou'd be Civil: And it cannot be deny'd but we are in many Ca&s;es, and particularly to Strangers, the Churli&s;he&s;t People alive.</P>
<P>As to Vices, who can di&s;pute our <HI>Intemperance,</HI> while an <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> Drunken Fellow is a Character in a
<PB REF="8">
Mans Prai&s;e? All our Reformations are Banters, and will be &s;o, till our Magi&s;trates and Gentry Reform them&s;elves by way of Example; then, and not till then, they may be expected to Puni&s;h others without Blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood of that particular People, who pretending to be Prote|&s;tants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Li|berties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <HI>James</HI> and his Popi&s;h Powers: Together, with &s;uch who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the pre&s;ent Government, and yet abu&s;e and affront the King, who procur'd it, and openly profe&s;s their Un|ea&s;ine&s;s under him: The&s;e, by what&s;oever Names or Titles they are dignified, or di&s;tingui&s;h'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I di&s;own, but that it is &s;o much the Temper of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to abu&s;e his Bene|factor, that I could be glad to &s;ee it rectified.</P>
<P>They who think I have been Guilty of any Error, in expo&s;ing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to them&s;elves, may among many hone&s;t In&s;tances of the like Nature, find the &s;ame thing in Mr. <HI>Cowely,</HI> in his Imitation of the &s;econd Olympick Ode of <HI>Pindar:</HI> His Words are the&s;e,<Q><L>But in this Thankle&s;s World, the Givers</L>
<L>Are Envy'd even by th' Receivers:</L>
<L>'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>Rather to hide than pay an Obligation.</L>
<L>Nay, 'tis much wor&s;e than &s;o;</L>
<L>It now an <HI>Artifice</HI> doth grow,</L>
<L><HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>Outrages</HI> to do,</L>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SPeak, <HI>Satyr;</HI> for there's none can tell like thee,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery,</L>
<L>That makes this Di&s;contented Land appear</L>
<L>Le&s;s Happy now in Times of Peace, than War?</L>
<L>Why Civil Feuds di&s;turb the Nation more</L>
<L>Than all our Bloody Wars have done before?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fools out of Favour Grudge at Knaves in Place,</L>
<L><HI>And Men are always Hone&s;t in Di&s;grace:</HI></L>
<L>The Court Preferments make Men Knaves in cour&s;e:</L>
<L>But they which wou'd be in them, wou'd be wor&s;e.</L>
<L>'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou'd Foreigners their Perqui&s;ites re&s;ign:</L>
<L>The Grand Contention's plainly to be &s;een,</L>
<L>To get &s;ome Men put out, and &s;ome put in.</L>
<L>For this our S&mdash;rs make long Harangues,</L>
<L>And florid M&mdash;rs whet their poli&s;h'd Tongues.</L>
<L><HI>State&s;men are always &s;ick of one Di&s;ea&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And a good Pen&s;ion gives them pre&s;ent Ea&s;e.</HI></L>
<L>That's the Specifick makes them all Content</L>
<L>With any King, and any Government.</L>
<L>Good Patriots at Court-Abu&s;es rail;</L>
<L>And all the Nation's Grievances bewail:</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Sov'reign Bal&s;am</HI>'s once apply'd,</L>
<L>The Zealot never fails to change his Side.</L>
<L>And when he mu&s;t the <HI>Golden Key</HI> re&s;ign,</L>
<L>The <HI>Railing Spirit</HI> comes about again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Who &s;hall this Bubbl'd Nation di&s;abu&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>While they their own Felicities refu&s;e?</L>
<L>Who at the Wars have made &s;uch mighty Pother,</L>
<L>And now are falling out with one another:</L>
<L>With needle&s;s Fears the Jealous Nation fill,</L>
<L><HI>And always have been &s;av'd again&s;t their Will:</HI></L>
<L>Who Fifty Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> have disburs'd,</L>
<L>To be with Peace and too much Plenty Curs'd.</L>

Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo,</L>

<L>Go back to elder Times, and Ages pa&s;t,</L>
<L>And Nations into long Oblivion ca&s;t;</L>
<L>To old <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Youthful Days retire,</L>
<L>And there for <HI>True-Born Engli&s;hmen</HI> enquire.</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI> freely will di&s;own the Name,</L>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults, but he that has none of his own, <HI>&s;ay &s;ome People, who are loth to be told of their Errours;</HI> and 'tis on this Account only, that the World has the Trouble of a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>If that be true, the Author freely acknowledges he is the mo&s;t unqualified Man in the World to reprove.</P>
<P>That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes, who allows him&s;elf in the Practice of the &s;ame, is very rea|dily granted, and is the very Sub&s;tance and Foundation of the following <HI>Satyr:</HI> And on that &s;core, the Author has as good a Title to Animadver&s;ion as another, &s;ince no Man can charge him with the Vices he has reproved.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of Self-defence, he is rather willing to look back on the be&s;t Actions of his Life, with the Temper of a Penitent, and he wi&s;hes all Men wou'd do the like; 'tis the only way to make the <HI>Satyr</HI> Impertinent.<Q><L>For Penitence would all his Ver&s;e di&s;arm,</L>
<L>The <HI>Satyr</HI>'s an&s;wer'd if the Men reform.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the Fact is not true neither: 'Tis a very pretty way for Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition. If
<PB N="62" REF="63">
none but faultle&s;s Men mu&s;t reprove others, the Lord ha' Mercy upon all our Magi&s;trates; and all our Clergy are undignified and &s;u&s;pended at a Blow.</P>
<P>Nor does the <HI>Satyr</HI> a&s;&s;ault private Infirmity, or pur&s;ue Per&s;onal Vices; but is bent at tho&s;e, who pretending to &s;uppre&s;s Vice, or being ve&s;ted with Authority for that pur|po&s;e, yet make them&s;elves the Shame of their Country, en|couraging Wickedne&s;s by that very Authority they have to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>He profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;orry, either that Freedom of Speech is &s;o dangerous in this Age, or that he is too much a Cow|ard; otherwi&s;e, &s;ome had heard of their Crimes who think them&s;elves above the Power of Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>'Tis hard that Vice &s;hould have &s;o much &s;helter from Civil Power, that Reproof &s;hou'd lead the Party to &s;uppre&s;s the Poet rather than the Crime.</P>
<P>And yet his Friends give him over for lo&s;t: An Ac|count of what he has ventur'd to &s;ay, to who&s;e Importunity he thinks him&s;elf oblig'd to an&s;wer with <HI>Juvenal,</HI><Q><L>Difficile e&s;t Satyram non &s;cribere. Nam quis Iniquae</L><L>Tam Patiens Urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat &s;e?</L></Q></P>
<P>If any Man is injur'd by the Characters, he is content they &s;hould carry their Re&s;entment to what Extremity they plea&s;e; but if Truth may be on his &s;ide, the only way to make him do them Ju&s;tice is to reform: And he promi&s;es to give Te&s;timony to their Repentance, <HI>as an Amand Honourable,</HI> in a manner as publick as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>REformation of Manners is a Work &s;o Honourable, and at this Time &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that like the Reform of our Money it can be no longer delay'd.</P>
<P>The Ways by which the pre&s;ent Torrent of Vice has been let in upon the Nation, and by which it maintains the Ty|ranny it has u&s;urp'd on the Lives of the Inhabitants, are too plain to be hid. The following Sheets aim at the Work, by leading to the mo&s;t direct means, <HI>Viz.</HI> Reformation by Ex|ample. Laws are, <HI>in Terrorem</HI> Puni&s;hments, and Ma|gi&s;trates Compel and put a Force upon Mens Minds; but Example is Per&s;wa&s;ive and Gentle, and draws by a Secret, Invi&s;ible, and almo&s;t Involuntary Power.</P>
<P>If there can be any Remedies propo&s;ed more proper to bring it to pa&s;s, they that know them would do well to bring them forth. In the mean time the Author thinks Con&s;cience in the Minds of Men Impartially Con&s;ulted, will give a <HI>Pro|batum e&s;t</HI> to the following Propo&s;al; and to that Judgment be refers all tho&s;e who Object again&s;t it.</P>

<HEAD>THE The Poor Man's PLEA.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;earching for a proper Cure of an Epidemick Di&s;temper, Phy&s;icians do tell us 'tis fir&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry to know the Cau&s;e of that Di&s;temper, from what Part of the Body, and from what ill Habit it proceeds; and when the Cau&s;e is di&s;cover'd, it is to be removed, that the Effect may cea&s;e of its &s;elf; but if removing the Cau&s;e will not work the Cure, then in|deed they proceed to apply proper Remedies to the Di&s;ea&s;e it &s;elf, and the particular Part afflicted.</P>
<P>Immorality is without doubt the pre&s;ent reigning Di&s;temper of the Nation: And the King and Parli|ament, who are indeed the proper Phy&s;icians, &s;eem nobly inclin'd to undertake the Cure. 'Tis a Great Work, well worthy their utmo&s;t Pains: The Honour of it, were it once perfected, would add more Tro|phies to the <HI>Crown,</HI> than all the Victories of <HI>this Bloody War,</HI> or the Glories of <HI>this Honourable Peace.</HI></P>
<P>But as a Per&s;on under the Violence of a Di&s;ea&s;e &s;ends in vain for a Phy&s;ician, unle&s;s he re&s;olves to make u&s;e of his Pre&s;cription; &s;o in vain does the King attempt to reform a Nation, unle&s;s they are willing to reform them&s;elves, and to &s;ubmit to his Pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Wickedne&s;s is an Ancient Inhabitant in this Coun|try, and 'tis very hard to give its Original.</P>
<P>But however difficult that may be, 'tis ea&s;y to look back to a time when we were not &s;o generally infect|ed with Vice as we are now; and 'twill &s;eem &s;uffici|ent to enquire into the Cau&s;es of our pre&s;ent Defecti|on.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Religion &s;eems to have an unque&s;ti|oned <HI>Title</HI> to the fir&s;t introducing a &s;trict Morality
<PB N="112" REF="113">
mong us; and 'tis but ju&s;t to give the Honour of it, where 'tis &s;o eminently due. Reformation of Man|ners has &s;omething of a Natural Con&s;equence in it from Reformation in Religion For &s;ince the prin|ciples of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion di&s;own the Indulgen|cies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, by which a thou&s;and Sins are, <HI>as Venial Crimes,</HI> bought off, and the Prie&s;t, to <HI>&s;ave God Almighty the trouble,</HI> can blot them out of the Account before it comes to his hand; common Vices lo&s;t their Charter, and men could not &s;in at &s;o cheap a Rate as before. The Prote&s;tant Religion has in it &s;elf a Natural Tendency to Virtue, as a &s;tanding Te|&s;timony of its own Divine Original, and accordingly it has &s;uppre&s;s'd Vice and Immorality in all the Coun|tries where it has had a Footing: It has civiliz'd Nati|ons, and reform'd the very <HI>Tempers</HI> of its Profe&s;&s;ors: Chri&s;tianity and Humanity has gone hand in hand in the World; and there is &s;o vi&s;ible a difference between the other Civiliz'd Governments in the World, and tho&s;e who now are under the Prote&s;tant Powers, that it carries its Evidence in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Reformation, begun in <HI>England</HI> in the days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and afterwards gloriou&s;ly fi|ni&s;hed by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> brought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nati|on to &s;uch a degree of Humanity, and Sobriety of Conver&s;ation, as we have rea&s;on to doubt will hard|ly be &s;een again in our Age.</P>
<P>In King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, the Court affect|ing &s;omething more of Gallantry and Gaiety, Luxury got footing; and twenty Years Peace, together with no extraordinary Examples from the Court, gave too great Encouragement to Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>If it took footing in King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, it took a deep Root in the Reign of his Son; and the Liberty given the Soldiery in the Civil War, di&s;|pers'd all manner of Prophanne&s;s throughout the Kingdom. That Prince, tho' very Pious in his own
<PB N="117" REF="114">
Per&s;on and Practice and had the Misfortune to be the fir&s;t King of <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps in the World, that ever e&s;tabli&s;h'd Wickedne&s;s by a Law: By what un|happy Council, or &s;ecret ill Fate he was guided to it, is hard to determine; but the <HI>Book of Sports,</HI> as it was called, that Book to tolerate the Exerci&s;e of all Sports and Pa&s;times on the Lord's-Day, tended more to the vitiating the Practice of this Kingdom, <HI>as to keeping that Day,</HI> than all the Acts of Parliament, Proclama|tions and Endeavours of future Princes has done, or ever will do, to reform it.</P>
<P>And yet the People of <HI>England</HI> expre&s;s'd a general &s;ort of an Aver&s;ion to that Liberty; <HI>and &s;ome,</HI> as if glutted with too much Freedom, when the Reins of Law were taken off, refu&s;ed that Practice they allow'd them&s;elves in before.</P>
<P>In the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, Lewdne&s;s and all manner of Debauchcry arriv'd to its Meridian: The Encouragement it had from the Practice and Al|lowance of the Court, is an invincible Demon&s;tration how far the Influence of our Government extends in the Practice of the People.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King and his late Queen, who&s;e Glo|rious Memory will be dear to the Nation as long as the World &s;tands, have had all this wicked Knot to unravel. This was the fir&s;t thing the Queen &s;et up|on while the King was engaged in his Wars abroad: She fir&s;t gave all &s;orts of Vice a general Di&s;courage|ment; and on the contrary, rais'd the value of Vir|tue and Sobriety by her Royal Example. The King having brought the War to a Glorious Conclu&s;ion, and &s;ettled an Honourable Peace, in his very fir&s;t Speech to his <HI>Parliament</HI> proclaims a New War again&s;t <HI>Prophanene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Immorality,</HI> and goes on al&s;o to di&s;|courage the practice of it by his Royal Example.</P>
<P>Thus the Work is begun nobly and regularly; and the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the General Repre&s;entative of the Na|tion,
<PB N="118" REF="115">
follows this Royal Example, in enacting Laws to &s;uppre&s;s all manner of Prophanene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are Great Things, and, well-improv'd, would give an undoubted Overthrow to to the Tyranny of Vice, and the Dominion <HI>Prophanene&s;s</HI> has u&s;urp'd in the hearts of Men.</P>
<P>But we of the <HI>Plebeii</HI> find our &s;elves ju&s;tly aggrie|ved in all this Work of Reformation; and this Re|forming Rigor makes the real Work impo&s;&s;ible: Wherefore we find our &s;elves forced to &s;eek Redre&s;s of our Grievances in the old hone&s;t way of Petition|ing Heaven to relieve us: And in the mean time, we &s;olemnly Enter our <HI>Prote&s;tation</HI> again&s;t the Vicious part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation; as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We Prote&s;t, That we do not find, impartial|ly enquiring into the matter, &s;peaking of Moral Good|ne&s;s, that you are not one jot better than we are, <HI>your Dignities, E&s;tates, and Quality excepted.</HI> 'Tis true, we are all bad enough, and we are willing in good Manners to agree, that we are as wicked as you; but we cannot find, on the exacte&s;t Scrutiny, but that in the Commonwealth of Vice, the Devil has taken care to level Poor and Rich into one Cla&s;s, and is fair|ly going on to make us all Graduates in the la&s;t De|gree of Immorality.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We do not find that all the Proclama|tions, Declarations, and Acts of Parliament yet made, have any <HI>effective Power</HI> to puni&s;h <HI>you</HI> for your Immo|ralities, as it does <HI>us.</HI> Now while <HI>you</HI> make Laws to puni&s;h <HI>us,</HI> and let <HI>your &s;elves</HI> go free, tho' guilty of the &s;ame Vices and Immoralities, tho&s;e Laws are unju&s;t and unequal in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Laws do not expre&s;s a Liberty to <HI>you,</HI> and a Puni&s;hment to <HI>us;</HI> and therefore the King and Parliament are free, as King and Parliament, from this our Appeal; but the Gentry and Magi&s;trates of the
<PB N="119" REF="116">
Kingdom, while they execute tho&s;e Laws upon us the poor Commons, and them&s;elves practi&s;ing the &s;ame Crimes, in defiance of the Laws both of God and Man, go unpuni&s;h'd; <HI>This</HI> is the Grievance we prote&s;t a|gain&s;t, as unju&s;t and unequal.</P>
<P>Wherefore, till the Nobility, Gentry, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and Clergy, will be plea&s;ed either to Re|form their own Manners, and &s;uppre&s;s their own Im|moralities, or find out &s;ome method and Power im|partially to puni&s;h them&s;elves when guilty, we Hum|bly crave Leave to Object again&s;t &s;etting any Poor Man in the Stocks, or &s;ending them to the Hou&s;e of Correction for Immoralities, as the mo&s;t unequal and unju&s;t way of proceeding in the World.</P>
<P><HI>And now Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>That this Prote&s;tation may not &s;eem a little too Rude, and a Breach of Good Manners to our Superi|ours, ws crave Leave to &s;ubjoin our Humble Appeal to your &s;elves; and will for once, knowing you as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen to be Men of Honour, <HI>make you Judges in your own Ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Gentlemen, We appeal to your &s;elves, whe|ther ever it be likely to perfect the Reformation of Manners in this Kingdom, without you; Whether Laws to puni&s;h us, without your Example al&s;o to influ|ence us, will ever bring the Work to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step from a loo&s;e vicious Practice in this Nation was begun by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, backt by a Reform'd Clergy, and a Sober Nobility: Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> carried it on: 'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which fir&s;t again Degenerated from that &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of Moral Virtues, and from thence carried Vice on to that degree it now appears in. From the Court Vice took its <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> into the Coun|try; and in the Families of the Gentry and Nobility it harbour'd, till it took heart under their <HI>Protection,</HI> and made a general Salley into the Nation; and We
<PB N="120" REF="117">
the poor Commons, who have been always ea&s;y to be guided by the Example of our Landlords and Gentle|men, have really been debauch'd into Vice by their Examples: And it mu&s;t be the <HI>Example of you the No|bility and Gentry of the Kingdom,</HI> that mu&s;t put a Stop to the Flood of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Prophanene&s;s</HI> which is broken in upon the Country, or it will never be done.</P>
<P>Our Laws again&s;t all manner of Vicious <HI>Practices</HI> are already very &s;evere: But Laws are u&s;ele&s;s in&s;ig|nificant things, if the Executive <HI>Power</HI> which lies in the Magi&s;trate be not exerted. The Ju&s;tices of the <HI>Peace</HI> have the power to puni&s;h, but if they do not put forth that power, 'tis all one as if they had none at all: Some have po&s;&s;ibly exerted this power; but where|ever it has been &s;o put forth, it has fallen upon us the poor Commons: The&s;e are all Cobweb Laws, in which the &s;mall Flies are catch'd, and great ones break thro'. My Lord Mayor has whipt about the poor Beggars, and a few &s;candalous Whores have been &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction; &s;ome Alehou&s;e-keepers and Vint|ners have been fin'd for drawing Drink on the Sab|bath day; but all this falls upon us of the Mob, the poor <HI>Plebeii,</HI> as if all the Vice lay among us; for we do not find the Rich Drunkard carri'd before my Lord Mayor, nor a Swearing Lewd <HI>Merchant. The man with a Gold Ring and Gay Cloaths,</HI> may Swear before the Ju&s;tice, or at the Ju&s;tice; may reel home through the open Streets, and no man take any notice of it; but if a poor man get drunk, or &s;wears an Oath, he mu&s;t to the Stocks without Remedy.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, We appeal to your &s;elves, whe|ther Laws or <HI>Proclamations</HI> are capable of having any Effect towards a Reformation of <HI>Manners,</HI> while the Benches of our Ju&s;tices are infected with the &s;canda|lous Vices of Swearing and Drunkenne&s;s; while our Ju&s;tices them&s;elves &s;hall puni&s;h a man for Drunken|ne&s;s, with a <HI>God damn him, &s;et him in the Stocks:</HI> And

<P>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, to be puni&s;h'd for a Crime, by a man as guilty as our &s;elves; and that the Fi|gure a man makes in the World, mu&s;t be the rea&s;on why he &s;hall not be liable to the Law: This is really puni&s;hing men for being poor, which is no Crime at all; as a Thief may be &s;aid to &s;aid to be hang'd, not for the Fact, but for being taken.</P>
<P>We further appeal to your &s;elves, Gentlemen, to inform us, whether there be any particular rea&s;on why you &s;hould be allow'd the full Career of your cor|rupt Appetites, without the Re&s;traint of Laws, while you your &s;elves agree that &s;uch Offences &s;hall be pun|i&s;hed in us, and do really execute the Law upon the Poor People, when brought before you for the &s;ame things.</P>
<P>Wherefore that the Work of Reformation of Man|ners may go on, and be brought to Perfection, to the Glory of God, and the great Honour of the King and Parliament: That Debauchery and Prophane&s;s, Drun|kenne&s;s, Whoring, and all &s;orts of Immoralities may be &s;uppre&s;s'd, we humbly propo&s;e the Method which may effectually accompli&s;h &s;o great a Work.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the Gentry and Clergy, who are the Leaders of us poor ignorant people, and our Lights erected on high places to Guide and Govern us, would in the fir&s;t place put a voluntary Force upon them|&s;elves, and effectually reform their own Lives, their way of conver&s;ing, and their common Behaviour a|mong their Servants and Neighbours.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gentry. They are the Original of the Modes, and Cu&s;toms, and Manners of their Neigh|bours; and their examples in <HI>the Countries e&s;pecially</HI> are very moving. There are three &s;everal Vices, which have the principal Mannagement of the great|e&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="119">
part of Mankind, <HI>viz.</HI> Drunkenne&s;s, Swearing, and Whoring; all of them very ill becoming a Gen|tleman, however Cu&s;tom may have made them Mo|di&s;h: Where none of the&s;e Three are in a Hou&s;e, there is certainly &s;omething of a Plantation of God in the Family; for they are &s;uch Epidemic Di&s;tempers, that hardly Humane Nature is entirely free from them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Drunkenne&s;s that Bruti&s;h Vice; a Sin &s;o &s;or|did, and &s;o much a Force upon Nature, that had God Almighty enjoyn'd it as a Duty, I believe many a Man would have ventur'd the lo&s;s of Heaven, rather than have have perform'd it. The <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of it &s;eems to be &s;o &s;ecretly hid, that wild Heathen Nations know nothing of the matter; 'tis only di&s;cover'd, by the wi&s;e people of the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Countries, who are <HI>Proficients</HI> in Vice, <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> in Wickedne&s;s, who can extract a Plea&s;ure to them&s;elves in lo&s;ing their Under&s;tanding, and make them&s;elves Sick at Heart for their Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the Hi&s;tory of this well bred Vice was to be writ|ten, 'twould plainly appear that it begun among the Gentry, and from them was handed down to the poo|rer &s;ort, who &s;till love to be like their Betters. Af|ter the Re&s;titution of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when drinking the King's Health became the di&s;tinction between a <HI>Cavalier</HI> and a <HI>Roundhead,</HI> Drunkenne&s;s <HI>be|gan its Reign,</HI> and it has Reign'd almo&s;t Forty Years: The Gentry care&s;s'd this Bea&s;tly Vice at &s;uch a Rate, that no Companion, no Servant was thought proper unle&s;s he could bear a Quantity of Wine: and to this Day 'tis added to the Character of a Man, as an addi|tional Title, when you would &s;peak well of him, <HI>He is an Hone&s;t Drunken Fellow;</HI> as if his Drunkenne&s;s was a Recommendation of his Hone&s;ty. From the practice of this na&s;ty Faculty, our Gentlemen have
<PB N="123" REF="120">
arriv'd to the teaching of it; and that it might be effectually pre&s;erv'd to the next Age, have very early in&s;tructed the Youth in it. Nay, &s;o far has Cu&s;tom prevail'd, that the Top of a Gentleman's Entertain|ment has been to make his Friend Drunk; and the Friend is &s;o much reconcil'd to it, that he takes that for the effect of his Kindne&s;s, which he ought as much to be affronted at, as if he had kick'd him down Stairs: Thus 'tis become a Science: and but that the In&s;truction proves &s;o ea&s;ie, and the Youth too apt to learn, po&s;&s;ibly we might have had a Colledge erected for it before now. The further Perfection of this Vice among the Gentry, will appear in two things; that 'tis become the Subject of their Glory, and the way of expre&s;&s;ing their Joy for any publick Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;aid a Gentleman of very high Quality, when after the Debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords, K. <HI>William</HI> was Voted into the Vacant Throne; <HI>Jack</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>God damn ye,</HI> Jack, <HI>go home to your Lady, and tell her we have got a Prote&s;tant King and Queen; and go make a Bonfire as big as a Hou&s;e, and bid the Butler make ye all Drunk, ye Dog:</HI> Here was &s;acrificing to the Devil, for a Thank&s;giving to God. Other Vices are committed as Vices, and Men act them in private, and are willing to hide them; but Drunkenne&s;s they are &s;o fond of, that they will glory in it, boa&s;t of it, and endeavour to promote it as much as po&s;&s;ible in others: 'Tis a Triumph to a Champion of the Bottle, to repeat how many Quarts of Wine he has Drank at a &s;itting, and how he made &s;uch and &s;uch Hone&s;t Fellows Drunk. Men <HI>Lye</HI> and <HI>For&s;wear,</HI> and <HI>hide it,</HI> and are <HI>a&s;ham'd of it,</HI> as indeed they have rea&s;on to do: But Drunkenne&s;s and Who|ring are Accompli&s;hments Men begin to value them|&s;elves upon, repeat them with Plea&s;ure, and affect a &s;ort of Vanity in the Hi&s;tory; are content all the world &s;hould be Witne&s;&s;es of their Intemperance, and have
<PB N="124" REF="121">
made the Crime a Badge of Honour to their Breeding and introduce the practice as a Fa&s;hion. And who|ever gives him&s;elf the Trouble to Reflect on the Cu|&s;tom of our Gentlemen in their Families, encourage|ing and promoting this Vice of Drunkenne&s;s, among the poor Commons, will not think it a Scandal upon the Geutry of <HI>England,</HI> if we &s;ay, That the Mode of Drinking, as 'tis now practi&s;ed, had its Original from the Practice of the Country-Gentlemen, and they again from the Court.</P>
<P>It may be objected, and God forbid it &s;hould not, That there are a great many of our Nobility and Gen|tlemen, who are Men of Honour and Men of Morals, and therefore this Charge is not univer&s;al. To which we an&s;wer, Tis univer&s;al for all that; becau&s;e tho&s;e very Gentlemen, tho' they are negatively clear as to the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Crimes we &s;peak of, yet are po&s;itively guilty, in not executing that Power the Law has put into their hands, with an Impartial Vigour. For where was that Gentleman or Ju&s;tice of the Peace ever yet found, who executed the Terms of the Law upon a Drunken, Swearing, Lewd Gentleman, his Neighbour, but the Quality of the Per&s;on has been a Licen&s;e to the open Exerci&s;e of the wor&s;t Crimes; as if there were any Baronets, Knights, or Squires in the next World; who becau&s;e of tho&s;e little &s;teps Cu&s;t|om had rai&s;ed them on, higher than their Neighbours, &s;hould be exempted from the Divine Judicature; or that, as Captain <HI>Vratz</HI> &s;aid, who was Hang'd for Mur|th'ring E&s;quire <HI>Thynn, God would &s;how them &s;ome re|&s;pect as they were Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>If there were any rea&s;on why a Rich Man &s;hould be permitted in the publick Exerci&s;e of Open Immo|ralities, and not the poor Man, &s;omething might be &s;aid: But if there be any difference it lies the other way; for the Vices of a poor Man affect only him&s;elf; but the Rich Man's Wickedne&s;s affects all the Neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="125" REF="122">
gives offence to the Sober, and encourages and hardens the Lewd, and quite overthrows the weak Re&s;olutions of &s;uch as are but indifferently fix|ed in their Virtue and Morality. If my own Watch goes fal&s;e, it deceives me and none el&s;e; but if the Town Clock goes fal&s;e, it deceives the whole Pari&s;h. The Gentry are the Leaders of the Mob; if they are Lewd and Drunken, the others &s;trive to imitate 'em; if they Di&s;courage Vice and Intemperance, the other will not be &s;o forward in it, nor &s;o fond of it.</P>
<P>To think then to effect a Reformation by puni&s;h|ing the Poor, while the Rich &s;eem to Enjoy a Charter for Wickedne&s;s, is like <HI>taking away the Effect, that the Cau&s;e may cea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>We find &s;ome People very fond of Monopolizing a Vice, they would have all of it to them&s;elves; they mu&s;t, as my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aid of him&s;elf, <HI>Sin like a Lord;</HI> little &s;neaking Sins won't &s;erve turn; but they mu&s;t be Lewd at a rate above the Common Size, to let the World &s;ee they are capable of it.</P>
<P>Our Laws &s;eem to take no Cognizance of &s;uch, per|haps for the &s;ame rea&s;on that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> made no Law again&s;t <HI>Parricide,</HI> becau&s;e he would not have the Sin named among his Citizens.</P>
<P>Now the poor Man &s;ees no &s;uch Dignity in Vice, as to &s;tudy Degrees; we are down-right in Wickedne&s;s, as we are in our Dealings; if we are Drunk, 'tis plain Drunkenne&s;s; Swearing, and Whoring, is all Blunderbus with us; we don't affect &s;uch Niceties in our Conver&s;ation; and the Ju&s;tices u&s;e us accordingly; nothing but the Stocks, or the Hou&s;e of Correction is the Ca&s;e, when we are brought before them; but when our Ma&s;ters the Gentlemen come to their Refi|ned Practice, and Sin by the Rules of Quality, we do not find any thing come of it but fal&s;e Heraldry, the Vice is puni&s;h'd by the Vice, and the Puni&s;hment re|news the Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="123">
The Ca&s;e in &s;hort is this; the Lewdne&s;s, Prophane|ne&s;s, and Immorality of the Gentry, which is the main Cau&s;e of the General Debauchery of the Kingdom is not at all toucht by our Laws, as they are now Executed; and while it remains &s;o, the Reformation of Manners can never be brought to pa&s;s, nor Prophanene&s;s and Immorality Suppre&s;s'd; and therefore the puni&s;hing the Poor di&s;tinctly, is a Mock upon the good De&s;igns of the King and Parliament; an Act of Inju&s;tice up|on them to puni&s;h them, and let others as guilty go free; and a &s;ort of Cruelty too, in taking the advan|tage of their Poverty to make them &s;uffer, becau&s;e they want E&s;tates to purcha&s;e their Exemption.</P>
<P>We have &s;ome weak Excu&s;es for this Matters, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered: As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Ju&s;tice of the Peace is a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Magi&s;t|rate,</HI> till an Information be brought before him, and is not to take notice of any thing, but as it is laid in Fact, and brought to an Affidavit. Now if an Affida|vit be made before a Ju&s;tice, that &s;uch or &s;uch a man Swore, or was Drunk, he mu&s;t, or cannot avoid Fin|ding him; the Law obliges him to it, let his Quality be what it will; &s;o that the Defect is not in the Law, nor in the Ju&s;tice, but in the want of Information.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Name of an Evidence or Informer is &s;o &s;candalous, that to attempt to inform again&s;t a Man for the mo&s;t open Breach of the Laws of Morality, is enough to denominate a man unfit for Society; a Rogue and an Informer are Synonimous in the Vulgar Acceptation; &s;o much is the real Detection of the o|pene&s;t Crimes again&s;t God, and Civil Government, Di&s;couraged and Avoided.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Cure is &s;uch, and the Habit has &s;o obtain'd upon all Mankind, that it &s;eems twi&s;ted with Human Nature, as an Appendix to Natural Frailty, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate from it:</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="124">
<HI>For An&s;wer:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis true, the Ju&s;tice of the Peace is in &s;ome re&s;pect a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Magi&s;trate,</HI> and does not act but by Information, but &s;uch Information would be brought if it were encouraged; if Ju&s;tices of of the Peace did acquaint them&s;elves with their Neigh|bourhood, they would &s;oon hear of the Immoralities of the Pari&s;h; and if they did impartially Execute the Law on &s;uch as offended, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons they would &s;oon have an Account of the Per&s;ons and Circum&s;tances. Be&s;ides, 'tis not want of Informati|on, but want of puni&s;hing what they have Informati|on of. A Poor Man informs again&s;t a Great Man, the Witne&s;s is di&s;couraged, the Man goes unpuni&s;h'd, and the Poor Man gets the Scandal of an Informer; and then 'tis but too often that our Ju&s;tices are not Men of extraordinary Morals them&s;elves; and who &s;hall Inform a Ju&s;tice of the Peace that &s;uch a Man Swore, when he may be heard to Swear him&s;elf as fa&s;t as another? Or who &s;hall bring a Man before a Ju|&s;tice for being Drunk, when the Ju&s;tice is &s;o Drunk him&s;elf, he cannot order him to be &s;et in the Stocks?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Be&s;ides, the Ju&s;tice has a Power to puni&s;h any Fact he him&s;elf &s;ees committed, and to enquire into any he hears of ca&s;ually: and if he will &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee tho&s;e Acts of Immorality committed before his Face, who &s;hall bring a Poor Man before him to be puni&s;hed? Thus I have heard a Thou&s;and horrid Oaths Sworn on a Bowling-Green, in the pre&s;ence of a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and he take no Notice of it, and go home the next hour, and &s;et a Man in the Stocks for being Drunk.</P>
<P>As to the Scandal of Informing, <HI>'tis an Error in Cu&s;tom,</HI> and a great Sin again&s;t Ju&s;tice; 'tis nece&s;&s;ary indeed that all Judgment &s;hould be according to Evidence, and to di|&s;courage Evidence is to di&s;courage Ju&s;tice; but that a Man in Trial of the Morality of his Neighbour, &s;hould be
<PB N="128" REF="125">
&s;hamed to appear, mu&s;t have &s;ome particular cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It proceeds from the Modi&s;hne&s;s of the Vice; it has &s;o obtain'd upon &s;ome Men Mens Practices, that to appear again&s;t what almo&s;t all Men approve, &s;eems malicious, and has a certain pro&s;pect either of Revenge or of a Mercenary Wretch, that Informs meerly to get a Reward. 'Tis true, if no Reward be plac'd upon an Information, no Man will take the trouble; and again, if too great a Reward, Men of Honour &s;hun the thing, becau&s;e they &s;corn the Fee, and to inform meerly for the Fee has &s;omething of a Ra&s;cal in it too; and from the&s;e rea&s;ons ari&s;es the Backwardne&s;s of the People.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame Rich Men we &s;peak of are the per|&s;ons who di&s;courage the Di&s;covery of Vice by &s;candalizing the Informer; a Man that is any thing of a Gentleman &s;corns it, and the Poor &s;till Mi|mick the Humour of the Rich, and hate an Informer as they do the Devil, 'Tis &s;trange the Gentlemen &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to detect the Breach of tho&s;e Laws, which they were not a&s;ham'd to make; but the very Name of an Informer has gain'd &s;o black an Idea in the minds People, becau&s;e &s;ome have made a Trade of inform|ing again&s;t People for Religion, have misbehaved them&s;elves, that truly 'twill be hard to bring any Man either of Credit or Quality to attempt it.</P>
<P>But the main thing which makes our Gentlemen backward in the pro&s;ecution of Vice, is their practi|cing the &s;ame Crimes them&s;elves, and they have &s;o much wicked Mode&s;ty and Genero&s;ity in them, being really no Enemies to the thing it &s;elf, that they cannot with any &s;ort of Freedom puni&s;h in others what they practice them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the Times of Executing the Laws again&s;t Di&s;|&s;enters, we found a great many Gentlemen very Vi|gorous in Pro&s;ecuting their Neighbours; they did not &s;tick to appear in Per&s;on to di&s;turb <HI>Meetings,</HI> and
<PB N="125" REF="126">
demoli&s;h the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es,</HI> and rather than fail, would be Informers them&s;elves; the rea&s;on was be|cau&s;e they had al&s;o a di&s;like to the thing; but we never found a Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman, or Ju&s;tice of the Peace forward to do thus, becau&s;e they approved of it. Now were our Gentlemen and Magi&s;trates real Enemies to the Immoralities of this Age, did they really hate Drunkenne&s;s as a Vice, they would be for|ward and zealous to root the practice of it out of the Neighbourhood, they would not be backward or a|&s;ham'd to detect Vice, to di&s;turb Drunken A&s;&s;emblies, to di&s;per&s;e tho&s;e Plantations of Leachery, the Publick Bawdy Hou&s;es, which are almo&s;t as openly allowed as the <HI>Burdelloes</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> They would be willing to have all &s;orts of Vices Suppre&s;s'd, and glory in put|ting their hands to the Work; they would not be a|&s;ham'd to appear in the detecting Debauchery, or a|fraid to embroil them&s;elves with their Rich Neigh|bours. 'Tis Guilt of the &s;ame Fact which makes Con|nivance, and till that guilt be removed, the Gentle|men of <HI>England</HI> neither will or can indeed with any kind of Honour put their hands to the Reforming it in their Neighbours.</P>
<P>But I think 'tis ea&s;ie to make it appear that this dif|ficulty of Informing may be removed, and there need not be much occa&s;ion for that Scandalous Employment.</P>
<P>'Tis in the power of the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> to re|form the whole Kingdom without either Laws, Pro|clamations, or Informers; and without their Concur|rence, all the Laws, Proclamations, and Declarations in the World will have no Effect; the Vigour of the Laws con&s;i&s;ts in their Executive Power: Ten thou&s;and Acts of Parliament &s;ignifie no more than One &s;ingle Proclama|tion, unle&s;s the Gentlemen in who&s;e hands the Execu|tion of tho&s;e Laws is placed, take care to &s;ee them du|ly made u&s;e of; and how can Laws be duly Executed-but by an impartial Di&s;tribution of equal Rewards,
<PB N="130" REF="127">
and Puni&s;hments, without Regard to the Quality and Degree of the Per&s;ons? The Laws pu&s;h on the Ju|&s;tices now, and they take care to go no fa&s;ter than they are driven; but would the Ju&s;tices pu&s;h on the Laws, Vice would fly before them, as Du&s;t in the Wind, and Immoralities would be &s;oon &s;uppre&s;s'd; but it can never be expected that the Magi&s;trates &s;hould pu&s;h on the Laws to a free Suppre&s;&s;ion of Im|moralities, till they Reform them&s;elves, and their Great Neighbours Reform them&s;elves, that there may be none to Puni&s;h, who are too big for the Magi&s;trate to venture upon,</P>
<P>Would the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> decry the Modi&s;h|ne&s;s of Vice by their own Practice; would they but da&s;h it ouf of Countenance by di&s;owning it; that Drunkenne&s;s and Oaths might once come into <HI>dife|&s;teem,</HI> and be out of Fa&s;hion, and a Man be valued the le&s;s for them; that he that will Swear, and be Drunk, &s;hall be counted a Rake, and not fit for a Gentleman's Company. This would do more to Reforming the re&s;t of Mankind than all the Puni&s;hments the Law can inflict; the Evil encrea&s;ed by Example, and mu&s;t be Suppre&s;s'd the the &s;ame way. If the Gentry were thus Reform'd, their Families would be &s;o too: No Servant would be Entertain'd, no Workman Employ|ed, no Shopkeeper would be Traded with by a Gen|tleman, but &s;uch as like them&s;elves, were &s;ober and hone&s;t; a Lewd Vicious Drunken Footman mu&s;t Re|form or Starve, he would get no Service; a Servant once turn'd away for his Intemperance would be En|tertain'd by no Body el&s;e; a Swearing Debauch'd Labourer or Workman mu&s;t Reform, or no Body would Employ him; the Drunken Whoring Shop|keeper mu&s;t grow Sober, or lo&s;e all his Cu&s;tomers, and be undone. Intere&s;t and Good Manners will re|form us of the poorer &s;ort, there would be no need of the Stocks or Hou&s;es of Correction; we &s;hould be
<PB N="131" REF="128">
Sober of Cour&s;e, becau&s;e we &s;hould be all Beggars el&s;e; and he that loved the Vice &s;o dearly as to pur|cha&s;e it with the lo&s;s of his Trade and Employment, would &s;oon grow too Poor for his Vice, and be forc'd to leave it by his own Nece&s;&s;ities; there would be no need of Informers, a Vicious Fellow would be pre|&s;ently Notorious, he would be the Talk of the Town, every one wou'd &s;light and &s;hun him for fear of be|ing thought like him, by being &s;een in his Company: he would Expo&s;e him&s;elf, and would be Puni&s;h'd as unpitied as a Thief.</P>
<P>So that in &s;hort, the whole Weight of this Ble&s;&s;ed Work of Reformation, lies on the Shoulders of the Gentry; they are the cau&s;e of our Defection, which being taken away, the Effect would cea&s;e of Cour&s;e, Vice would grow Scandalous, and all Mankind would be a&s;ham'd of it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Clergy al&s;o ought not to count them|&s;elves exempted in this matter, who&s;e Lives have been, and in &s;ome places &s;till are &s;o vicious and &s;o loo&s;e, that 'tis well for <HI>England</HI> we are not &s;ubject to be much <HI>Prie&s;t-riddden.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a &s;trange thing how it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e than it is with us the poor Commonalty, when the Gentry our Pattern, and the Clergy our Teachers are as Immoral as we. And then to con&s;ider the Cohe|rence of the thing; <HI>the Par&s;on preaches a thundering Ser|mon again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, and the Ju&s;tice of Peace &s;ets my poor Neighbour in the Stocks, and I am like to be much the better for either, when I know perhaps that this &s;ame Par&s;on and this &s;ame Ju&s;tice were both Drunk together the Night before.</HI></P>
<P>It may be true, for ought we know, that a Wick|ed Par&s;on may make a good Sermon; and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb may be true of the Soul as well as the Body, <HI>If the Cure be but wrought, let the Devil be the Doctor;</HI> but this does not take with the down-right ignorant

People in the Country; a poor Man gets Drunk in a Country Ale Hou&s;e, <HI>Why, are you not a&s;ham'd to be &s;uch a Bea&s;t, &s;ays a good hone&s;t Neighbour to him the next day?</HI> A&s;ham'd, &s;ays the Fellow!

<P>A Vicious Par&s;on that preaches well, but lives ill, may be like an unskilful Hor&s;eman, who opens a Gate on the wrong &s;ide, and lets other Folks through, but &s;huts him&s;elf out. This may be po&s;&s;ible, but it &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable to think they are a means by that &s;ort of living, to hinder both them&s;elves and others; and would the Gentry and Clergy of <HI>England</HI> but look back on the Guilt that really lies on them, as Gentle|men by who&s;e Example &s;o great a part of Mankind has been led into, and encouraged in the Progre&s;s of Vice, they would find Matter of very &s;erious reflecti|on.</P>
<P>This Article of the Clergy may &s;eem to lie in the Power of their Superiors to rectify, and therefore may be &s;omething more fea&s;ible than the other; But the Gentry are <HI>Sui juris,</HI> can no way be reduced but by their own voluntary practice.

<P><HI>Sir,</HI> If you knew the Author, you would ea&s;ily be &s;atis|fied that the Rea&s;on of this Preface, is not that he covets to engage in Controver&s;y with a Per&s;on of your Capacity and Learning, being altogether unfit for &s;uch a Task, and no way a Match to your Talent that way.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE UPON Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I review the Pa&s;t Times, and look back upon the various Scenes which they pre&s;ent us, as to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tran&s;acti|ons within this Kingdom, there &s;eems nothing more &s;trange than the Turns we have had from Popi&s;h to Re|gal Supremacy, from the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion to Reform'd, from Reform'd back again to <HI>Romi&s;h,</HI> and then to Refor|med again, and &s;o on thro' &s;everal Degrees of Refor|mation, and back again from tho&s;e Degrees to the fir&s;t Steps of Reformation, and then forward again.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, a Prince of a haughty Spirit, di&s;daining the In&s;olence with which his Predece&s;&s;ors were treated by the Popes, gave the fir&s;t Shock to the <HI>Roman</HI> Power in the&s;e Kingdoms. I won't &s;ay he acted from any principles of Con&s;cience, whatever his Ambition and Intere&s;t led him to pretend; but <HI>that</HI> was the Glo&s;s, as it is in mo&s;t Ca&s;es of Publick Revolutions. <HI>However it was,</HI> having &s;atisfi'd his Pride by &s;ubduing the Suppremacy of the Pope, and e&s;tabli&s;hing his own; his Intere&s;t next guided him to the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Abbies and Mona&s;tries. The hor|rible Vices which were protected, as well as practiced in tho&s;e Ne&s;ts of Super&s;tition, giving his pretence of Piety the larger Scope; and I'll for once be &s;o free with the Character of that Prince, as to &s;uppo&s;e what to me &s;eems plain, that <HI>neither This Religion, or That, were of</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="134">
<HI>much Moment in his Thoughts, but his Intere&s;t,</HI> as the Sequel made plain, by the Seizure he made of the Re|venues of the Church.</P>
<P>And yet the Ju&s;tice of Providence &s;eems very con|&s;picuous in that point, That tho&s;e Hou&s;es, who under the &s;pecious pretences of Religion and extraordinary Devotion, had ama&s;&s;ed to them&s;elves va&s;t Revenues to the Impoveri&s;hing many Families, and in the mean time &s;ecretly practiced mo&s;t unheard of Wickedne&s;s, &s;hould under the &s;ame pretence of Zeal and Piety be &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed by a Per&s;on, who meerly to &s;erve his own Glory, triumph'd over them, pretending, <HI>Jehu</HI> like, <HI>to &s;hew his Zeal for the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Some do a&s;&s;ure us, That the Eyes of this Pince were really open'd as to the Point of Religion; and that had he liv'd longer, he would mo&s;t effectually have e|&s;tabli&s;h'd the Reformation in his time; but God who gave him that light, <HI>if he had it,</HI> however he might ac|cept his Intention, as he did that of <HI>David</HI>'s Building his Hou&s;e, yet he re&s;erv'd the Glory of the performance to his Son.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th, of whom wondrous things are &s;poken in all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers, and more than we need &s;uppo&s;e &s;hould be literally true; yet was without doubt, a Prince of the &s;tricte&s;t Piety, not only that ever reign'd, but that ever liv'd, perhaps, &s;ince the Days of <HI>Jo&s;idh,</HI> who&s;e Parallel our Writers &s;ay he was.</P>
<P>The Reformation began in his hand; not but that the Prote&s;tant Religion had been received in <HI>England</HI> many years before, by the preaching of <HI>John Wickliff, William Tindall,</HI> and others, and had many profe&s;&s;ors, and tho&s;e &s;uch who gallantly offered their Lives in de|fence of the Truth.</P>
<P>But it got but little ground, for Religion has but few Votaries, while all its profe&s;&s;ors mu&s;t al&s;o be Con|fe&s;&s;ors, and while Exile or Martyrdom is all the pro&s;|pect of Advantage to be got by it.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="135">
None will dare to be Di&s;&s;enters in times of Danger, but &s;uch who&s;e Con&s;ciences are &s;o awaken'd that they dare not be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the hands of this young Prince, the great work was begun, and in a &s;horter time than could be ima|gin'd, was fini&s;h'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd; the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> fled or conformed; for we find but very few had an Inclina|tion to Martyrdom if it had been put upon them. Some indeed to &s;how the Nature of their Religion, <HI>Pleaded for</HI> Baal, <HI>and Rebell'd,</HI> &s;tirring up the Ignorant People to Murther their <HI>Gideon</HI> for throwing down the <HI>Altars of</HI> Baal, but like the <HI>Ephramites</HI> of old, their <HI>Shiboleth</HI> was their undoing.</P>
<P>God, who thought fit to di&s;cover the Levity of tho&s;e who had only Conform'd, and not Reform'd, who, <HI>in exemplum Regis,</HI> had took up this as they would have done any Religion, and al&s;o for the Tryal and Glo|ry of his Church, &s;uffer'd all this great Fabrick, <HI>how|ever of his own Working,</HI> to be overthrown at the Death this good King, and a Deluge of Cruelty and Popery overwhelm'd the People in the Reign of the Queen, his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>But <HI>Popery</HI> found more Di&s;&s;enters than the Reforma|tion had done; and the Impre&s;&s;ion Religion had made on the minds of tho&s;e who had &s;incerely Embrac'd it, was not &s;o ea&s;ily Defac'd as the pretended Reformati|on of others; For the Glo&s;&s;es Men had put on their Actions, only as a cover from common Ob&s;ervation, was &s;oon Di&s;cover'd, when the Safety of owning their Old principles render'd tho&s;e Out&s;ides no longer need|ful, but where the True Religion had got footing in the Mind, it was &s;till the &s;ame, whatever alterations of Times might meke it Dangerous, <HI>and yet all People did not Burn;</HI> but &s;ome being per&s;ecuted in one City, fled to another, and <HI>Germany</HI> e&s;pecially was a Sanctuary for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, that Country having been before hand with us in the Reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="136">
'Twas here that our Exil'd Clergy having convers'd with the Learned Reformers abroad, and particularly with <HI>John Calvin,</HI> found, that tho' they were reform'd indeed from the Gro&s;s Errors of Popery and Super&s;ti|tion, there was yet &s;everal things which might be fur|ther and further Reform'd; and being willing to arrive to the greate&s;t Perfection they were capable of in Religion, (that as near as po&s;&s;ible they might pur|&s;ue the great Example of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who&s;e Name they profe&s;s'd, and for whom they cou'd mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly die,) they Corrected in them&s;elves tho&s;e things which they &s;aw needful, and by Letters to their Brethren in <HI>En|gland</HI> communicated their Opinions, with their Rea&s;ons, exhorting them to go on unto perfection as they had begun</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t Zealous for Piety and Holine&s;s of Life, rejected this Motion; and Others as Zealous and Pious, clos'd with it; and the Di&s;putes were carried &s;o far &s;ometimes, as to Invade the Charity of one another, an humble Acknowledgment of which you have in a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Reconciling Letter from Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridley</HI> to Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper,</HI> two of the mo&s;t Glorious Triumphant Martyrs that ever confe&s;t the truth of Chri&s;t at the Stake.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, the Fire of the Per&s;ecution (as the Greater Light ob&s;cures the Le&s;s, extingui&s;h'd that of Di&s;&s;ention. But when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> re&s;cu'd the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of King <HI>Edward</HI> obtain'd &s;o on the Minds of Men, that the further Reformation was rejected. The other Party being not at all convinc'd, tho' over-rul'd, &s;ubmitted their Per&s;ons to the Laws, but not their Opi|nion; affirming, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That 'twas the Duty of every Chri|&s;tian, to endeavour to &s;erve God with the grea|te&s;t Purity of Wor&s;hip as was po&s;&s;ible; and that this was the pure&s;t Wor&s;hip which came neare&s;t to the Divine In&s;titution, which they believ'd the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Liturgy did not, and therefore in Con&s;cience they mu&s;t be Di&s;&s;enters.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="137">
It mu&s;t be own'd, That the Original Authors of the&s;e Di&s;putes were Learned, Devout, and &s;ingularly Pious, &s;trict in Conver&s;ation to exce&s;s, <HI>if that be po&s;|&s;ible,</HI> and from thence in a &s;ort of happy Deri&s;ion, were call'd <HI>Puritans;</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but leave for a Record the la&s;t Speech of a Famous Fo|reigner, who had &s;een the way of living among tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;peaking of the Words of <HI>Balaam, Let me Die the Death of the Righteous, and let my latter end be like his,</HI> cry'd Out,<Q>Sit Anima Mea cum Puritanis <HI>Anglicanis.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not take upon me to ob&s;erve the Difference between the&s;e Primitive Di&s;&s;enters and Our Pre&s;ent, which is too plain; nor to di&s;pute the Sub&s;tance of the Point in Debate between them and the E&s;tabli&s;ht National Church.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, That the Rea&s;ons for the pre|&s;ent Di&s;&s;enters Separation from the E&s;tabli&s;ht Church, are &s;aid to be exactly the &s;ame they were then; and the pre&s;ent Di&s;&s;enters are the Succe&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e fir&s;t, as the pre&s;ent Conformi&s;ts are the Succe&s;&s;ors of the fir&s;t Reformers under King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge that it fares with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and with the Di&s;&s;enters both, as it has always far'd with Chri&s;t's Church in the whole World; That while Suppre&s;t and Per&s;ecuted, their Profe&s;&s;ors were few, and their Profe&s;&s;ion more &s;evere; but when a Religion comes to be the Mode of the Country, &s;o many painted Hypocrites get into the Church who are not by their Voices to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that Guile is not to be &s;een, till it arrive to Apo&s;tacy. The whole Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, from the fir&s;t Cen|tury of the Chri&s;tian Church, is full of In&s;tances to confirm this, That the Pro&s;perity of the Church of
<PB N="141" REF="138">
Chri&s;t has been more fatal to it, than all the Pe&s;ecuti|on of its Enemies.</P>
<P>I am now brought down to the pre&s;ent Time, when the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tant</HI> is &s;heltered by the Laws and protected from the Violence which he &s;uffered in the Late Reigns, under the Arbitrary Commands of &s;uch State Mini&s;ters, who &s;trove to da&s;h the whole Prote|&s;tant Intere&s;t to pieces by its own weight; and no|thing is more apparent to tho&s;e who are any thing acquainted with the late Management of Affairs in this Land, than that the Court u&s;ed both Parties alter|nately, as Policy and Occa&s;ion directed, to Suppre&s;s and De&s;troy one another; that the whole Hou&s;e, <HI>which being &s;o divided, cou'd not &s;tand,</HI> might at la&s;t fall of it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But our Eyes are at la&s;t opened, the Name of Pro|te&s;tant is now the common Title of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> extends her Protection to the tender Con&s;ciences of her Weaker Brethren, know|ing that all may be Chri&s;tians, tho' not alike inform'd, and the Di&s;&s;enter extends his Charity to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> believing that in his due time, <HI>God &s;hall reveal even this unto them.</HI> If this is not, I wi&s;h this were the Temper of both Parties; and I am &s;ure it is already the Temper of &s;ome of each Side, which few are of the Wi&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t Pious, and mo&s;t Ju|dicious.</P>
<P>But while Frailty and Infirmity are E&s;&s;ential to Humanity, and Pride and Hypocri&s;y are the two Regnant Vices of the Church, this good Spirit cannot be Univer&s;al, and we do not expect it.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;ort of Truth, which all Men owe to the Principles they profe&s;s, and generally &s;peaking, all Men pay it; a <HI>Turk</HI> is a <HI>Turk</HI> zealou&s;ly and entire|ly; an <HI>Idolater</HI> is an <HI>Idolater,</HI> and will <HI>&s;erve the Devil to a tittle:</HI> None but Prote&s;tants halt between <HI>God and Baal;</HI> Chri&s;tians of an Amphibious Nature, who
<PB N="142" REF="139">
have &s;uch prepo&s;terous Con&s;ciences, as can believe one Way of Wor&s;hip to be right, and yet &s;erve God another way them&s;elves; <HI>This is a &s;trange thing in I&s;rael!</HI> All the Hi&s;tories of Religion in the World do not &s;hew &s;uch a Ca&s;e: 'Tis like a Ship with her Sails hal'd &s;ome back and &s;ome full: 'Tis like a Workman that Builds with one Hand, and pulls down with t'other: 'Tis like a Fi&s;herman, who catches Fi&s;h with one Hand, and throws them into the Sea with another: 'Tis like every thing which &s;ignifies nothing. To &s;ay a Man can be of two Religions, is a Contra|diction, unle&s;s there be two Gods to Wor&s;hip, or he has two Souls to &s;aue.</P>
<P>Religion is the &s;acred Profe&s;&s;ion of the Name of God; <HI>&s;erving him, believing in him, expecting from him;</HI> and like the God it refers to, 'tis in one and the &s;ame Ob|ject, one and the &s;ame thing perfectly indivi&s;ible and in&s;eparable there is in it no Neuter Gender, no Am|biguous Article, <HI>God or Baal;</HI> Mediums are impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As to the different Modes and Ways, which are the Circum&s;tantials of this Sacred Thing I call Reli|gion; I won't &s;ay, but that as Ships take different Cour&s;es at Sea, yet to the be&s;t of their Skill, keeping to the direct Rules of Navigating by the Compa&s;s, they may arrive at the &s;ame Port; &s;o Chri&s;tians ta|king different Methods in the &s;erving this God, yet going to the be&s;t of their Judgments by the direct Rules of the Scripture, may arrive at the &s;ame Hea|ven; <HI>but this is nothing at all to the Ca&s;e;</HI> for no Ship would arrive at any Port that &s;ailed two ways toge|ther, <HI>if that were po&s;&s;ible;</HI> nor no man can &s;erve One God, and at the &s;ame time hold two Opinions. There is but one Be&s;t, and he that gives God <HI>two Be&s;ts,</HI> gives him the Be&s;t and the Wor&s;t, and one Spoils t'other, till both are good for nothing.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid already, that both the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enter, &s;uffer in their Reputation
<PB N="143" REF="140">
for the mixt Multitudes of their Members, which is occa&s;ion'd by their pre&s;ent Pro&s;perity: If a Third Party were to tyrannize over them both, we &s;hould &s;ee then who were <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> and who were <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors;</HI> but now it cannot be: Wherefore, I think 'twere well to put both Sides in mind of one thing, which they are bound mutually to ob&s;erve; and that is, That <HI>the Per|&s;onal Mi&s;carriages of any particular Per&s;on or Member, is not really any Reflection upon the Religion they profe&s;s,</HI> nor ought not to be &s;o accounted, unle&s;s it be where &s;uch Mi&s;carriages are the direct Dictates of the Do|ctrines they teach; and thus I would be under&s;tood in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.

<P><HI>He who Di&s;&s;ents from an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church on any ac|count, but from a real Principle of Con&s;cience, is a Politick, not a Religious Di&s;&s;enter.</HI> To explain my &s;elf; He who Di&s;&s;ents from any other Rea&s;ons, but &s;uch as the&s;e, That he firmly believes the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;hed Church is not of the pure&s;t In&s;titution, but that he can real|ly &s;erve God more agreeable to his Will, and that ac|cordingly 'tis his Duty to do it &s;o, <HI>and no otherwi&s;e.</HI> Nay, he that cannot Dye, or at lea&s;t de&s;ire to do &s;o, rather than Conform, <HI>ought to Conform. Schi&s;m</HI> from the Church of Chri&s;t is, doubtle&s;s, a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it, but if not, the Cau&s;e of that Sin carries the Guilt with it.</P>
<P>But if I &s;hall thus Di&s;&s;ent, and yet at the &s;ame time Conform; by Conforming I deny my Di&s;&s;ent being lawful, or by my Di&s;&s;enting I damn my Conforming as &s;inful.</P>
<P>Nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the &s;ame time; if it be not lawful for me to Di&s;&s;ent, I ought to Conform; but if it be unlawful for me to Conform, I mu&s;t Di&s;&s;ent; &s;everal Opinions may at the &s;ame

<P>To come to the point; there are Di&s;&s;enters who are &s;eparated from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and join'd in Communion with Di&s;&s;enting Churches or Congre|gations. They have appear'd Zealous, Con&s;cienti|ous, and Con&s;tant; have born the Reproaches and Inconveniences of their Party, nay, &s;uffer'd Per&s;ecu|tion, and Lo&s;s of E&s;tates and Liberty for the Cau&s;e: And who could have &s;o little Charity as to doubt the Sincerity of their Profe&s;&s;ion? And yet the&s;e Per&s;ecu|ted, Suffering Di&s;&s;enters, to make them&s;elves room in the Publick Advancements, and Glittering Gaw|dy Honours of the Age, &s;hall Conform to that which they refus'd under all tho&s;e Di&s;advantages to do be|fore. And which is wor&s;e than all this; hear O Hea|vens! as &s;oon as the pre&s;ent Honour is attain'd, the pre&s;ent Advantage made, they return to the former Circum&s;tances again, and are freely receiv'd, <HI>a double Crime,</HI> as having done no Evil.</P>
<P>I know not, I profe&s;s, what the&s;e Per&s;ons can &s;ay for them&s;elves, and therefore cannot pretend to An|&s;wer their Objections; but I cannot omit one An&s;wer which &s;ome People give for them, <HI>viz.

'Tis true, the Morality of an Action con&s;i&s;ts in its End; but I cannot conceive that an Action purely and originally Religious, &s;uch as the Solemn Ordinances of God's Wor&s;hip, can be made Civil Actions by any End, De&s;ign, Will, or In|tention of Man what&s;oever. 'Tis true, an Oath, which is a calling God to witne&s;s, is an Action both Civil and Religious, but &s;till that was appointed and in&s;tituted to that end, as is expre&s;ly noted, <HI>Heb. Naaman</HI>'s bowing in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rimmon;</HI> to which the Prophet an&s;wered, <HI>Go in Peace,</HI> which is under|&s;tood as a permi&s;&s;ion, is a thing &s;till different; for <HI>Naaman</HI> only bowed for the Conveniency or State of the King, at the &s;ame time publickly di&s;owning the Wor&s;hip, as <HI>Interpreters are of Opinion;</HI> be&s;ides, bow|ing the Head, tho' it may be a cu&s;tomary Act of Wor|&s;hip at that place, yet is no Act confin'd to Wor&s;hip only, and in&s;tituted and directed &s;o by the God who is Wor&s;hipped, but is an Act us'd in Common Salu|tations. Thus we kneel to God, and to the King; but Sacraments are things appropriated by the Divine In&s;titution of God him&s;elf, as things which have no other Signification or Import but what is Divine: Had <HI>Naaman</HI> de&s;ir'd to be excu&s;ed in offering Sacri|fices to the Idol <HI>Rimmon,</HI> the Prophet would hardly have bid him go in peace. Some Actions are not Ci|vil or Religious, as they are Civilly or Religiou&s;ly perform'd, but as they are Civil or Religious in them|&s;elves; for &s;ome Religious Actions are &s;o entirely &s;uch, that they cannot without a horrid inva&s;ion of the Soveraignty of the In&s;titutor be appropriated to any other u&s;e; and &s;uch are in e&s;pecial manner, the Two Sacraments in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, &s;uch was, be|fore Chri&s;t, the Sacrifices by Fire; And the Judg|ments of God on <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Ahihu,</HI> for attempting to offer Sacrifice with &s;trange Fire, &s;tands as a terrible
<PB N="146" REF="143">
In&s;tance of what we ought to think is the Will of God in this matter.</P>
<P>Further, &s;peaking directly of the Sacraments, Are they not the &s;ame thing, tho' differently Admini&s;tred in the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, or in a di&s;&s;enting Church? and how can you take it as a Civil Act in one place, and a Religious Act in another? This is <HI>playing-Bopeep</HI> with God Almighty, and no Man can tell of them when they are about a Civil Action, and when about a Religious. But to an&s;wer this pretence at once, Sacraments as Sacraments are Religious Acts, and can be no other, if you do not take it as a Sacrament the Ca&s;e differs, but how can you &s;ay you do not take it as a Sacrament? An Oath is to be taken in the Sen&s;e of the Impo&s;er, and a Sacrament, which is a Recogni|tion of the mo&s;t Sacred of Oaths, mu&s;t be al&s;o taken in the Sen&s;e of the Impo&s;er. If the Per&s;on Admini|&s;tring declar'd at the Admini&s;tration, <HI>He did not give it as a Sacrament, but only give you a bit of Bread and Draught of Wine as a Friend,</HI> or the like, this was &s;omething; but can a Mini&s;ter deliver the Bread to you, and &s;ay, <HI>The Body of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. and you Kneeling with Reverence take it as &s;uch, and repeat the Re&s;pon&s;es at the Communion, and &s;ay <HI>A|men</HI> to the Prayer, and &s;ay 'tis a Civil Action. This is &s;uch Bantering with Religion, as no Mode&s;t Chri|&s;tian can think of without Horror.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another part of the Apology is, That without it they cannot be admitted into Publick places of Tru&s;t; and if they were not admitted, &s;uch will get in as will betray their Country and Liberties, and they do it purely to &s;ecure their Country, which they think their Duty.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are Patriots indeed, that</HI> will <HI>damn their Souls to &s;ave their Countrey;</HI> a &s;ort of a Publick Spirit hardly to be found in the World, and indeed a Non-entity in it &s;elf, for 'tis a Mi&s;take; the Gentlemen who make

this An&s;wer, put the ca&s;e wrong. For I would de|&s;ire &s;uch to An&s;wer a few Que&s;tions. ear</P>
<P>If the Service of their Country be &s;o d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e to them, pray why &s;hould they not chu&s;e to expo their Bo|dies and E&s;tates for that Service, rather than their Souls?</P>
<P>The Penalty of the Law in accepting the Publick Employments is wholly Pecuniary; the difference lies here, <HI>they chu&s;e the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on their Con&s;ciences, before the hazard of their E&s;tates,</HI> as the lea&s;t Evil; for 'tis plain, any Man who will &s;uffer the Penalty, or run the Ri&s;que of it, which is all one, may excu&s;e the con|formity; for the Lord does not &s;ay, you &s;hall &s;o and &s;o Conform, but if you do not Conform, you &s;hall in|cur &s;uch and &s;uch Penalties; any Man that will incur the Penalty, may commit the Tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P>So that all this Compliance is not, To be admitted to Places, that they may be able to &s;erve their Coun|try, but to &s;ave the Five hundred pounds and other Penalties of that Act.</P>
<P N="2">2. Why, if we believe the Power of God to be Omnipotent, &s;hould we imagine that he is not able to protect our Country and Liberties, without our perpetrating &s;o wicked an Act to &s;ecure them, <HI>as do|ing Evil that Good may come,</HI> which is expre&s;ly for|bidden.</P>
<P>But we are told again, This is in it &s;elf no Sinful Act, and therefore it is not doing Evil. This is ta|citly an&s;wered before; tho' 'tis not a Sinful Act in it &s;elf, <HI>Yet 'tis either a Sinful Act in a Di&s;&s;enter, or el&s;e his Di&s;&s;enting before was a Sinful Act.</HI> For if he is &s;atis|fied he does well in Conforming now, why did he not before? There is but one An&s;wer for that, which is, He is otherwi&s;e convinced; to which I reply, If that were true, he would then as a Convert continue in this New Communion; but 'tis evident the &s;ame Per|&s;ons return immediately to the former Profe&s;&s;ion as
<PB N="148" REF="145">
Di&s;&s;enters, and they can have no &s;uch Excu&s;e unle&s;s it be, that they were convinc'd and reconvinc'd, and then convinc'd again.</P>
<P>Some have the Folly to argue again&s;t the Law it &s;elf, as a mo&s;t Notorious Impo&s;ition upon the Con&s;ci|ences of Man, by making the Sacred In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t a Drudge to Secular <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and a Cau&s;e of mens Sins, by leading them into Tempation; I could &s;ay enough to vindicate that part, tho I am no more reconcil'd to that Law, than other Men, but 'tis remote to our Argumnet: 'Tis an Act of Parliament, and what is &s;o, is of every Man's own doing, and there|fore 'tis ju&s;t every one &s;hou'd comply with the Terms, or &s;uffer the Penalty; but here is no <HI>Penalty,</HI> if no Crime; <HI>if no Preferments are &s;ought, no Honours accepted, there is no Crime;</HI> if Self denial was as practicable as Self advancement, here is no need of the <HI>Crime.</HI> So that they who do this, <HI>&s;eek the Crime, that is the fir&s;t Sin; then Morgage their Con&s;ciences to avoid the Penalty,</HI> and &s;o add one Sin to another. But we are told by &s;ome, 'tis not again&s;t their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> they hope both <HI>Par|ties</HI> are Good <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> there are differences between them which they don't under&s;tand nor meddle with, and their Con&s;ciences are very well &s;atisfied to Com|municate with either.</P>
<P>I would ask &s;uch, if their Con&s;ciences would &s;erve to Communicate with the Church, why did they Sepa|rate? For Communicating with the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> is not an Occa&s;ional or Ca&s;ual thing, but an open declar'd breaking off from the <HI>Church</HI> E&s;tabli&s;ht. Now no Man can be &s;aid to &s;eparate from, and joyn to a thing at the &s;ame time; if your <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is &s;atis|fied in Joyning, it cannot be &s;atisfied in Separating, unle&s;s you can &s;uppo&s;e your Con&s;cience to be &s;atisfied and di&s;&s;atisfied both together. If you have a Con&s;ci|ence of any Religion at all, it mu&s;t be of &s;ome Reli|gion or other; if of this, it cannot be of that, if of
<PB N="149" REF="146">
&s;ent and Approve, are different Acts, and can never be fixt upon the &s;ame Object at the &s;ame time; as for a Man, Pa&s;&s;ively Religious, that can Communicate any where, that Man may from the &s;ame Principle, and with far le&s;s Guilt Communicate no where, for &s;uch a Man, in down-right <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> has Pro&s;tituted the lit|tle Religion he had, <HI>if ever he had any,</HI> to his Intere&s;t, and may be <HI>Turk, Jew, Papi&s;t,</HI> or any thing.</P>
<P>The latter part of the Charge leads me to con&s;ider another Point, which relates to the A&s;&s;emblies of the Di&s;&s;enters, who admit, and by con&s;equence approve this way of proceeding. I do not pretend to examine by what Methods &s;uch particular Churches do procced. And I would be as tender as po&s;&s;ible in making Re|flections. I wi&s;h they would be as Charitable in cen|&s;uring this Reproof.</P>
<P>I do think, with Submi&s;&s;ion, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to prove that any Per&s;on, who&s;e Ca&s;e the foregoing Paragraph reaches, can be receiv'd again into Church-Communi|on in a Di&s;&s;enting A&s;&s;embly upon any other Terms, <HI>than as a Penitent.</HI> I have heard of &s;ome, who have been &s;aid to have leave from their Mini&s;ters for this Matter; <HI>if &s;o,</HI> they have a&s;&s;um'd &s;ome <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ing Au|thority,</HI> which I believe does not appertain to the Mi|ni&s;terial Function, nor is not contain'd in the Mi&s;&s;ion of our Saviour. But I do not affirm, That any &s;uch thing has been really allow'd.</P>
<P>As to the Relation of Churches, and the Members thereof, one to another, as the Di&s;&s;enters now E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd them; I am &s;ure, the allowance of any Member in a Promi&s;cuous Communion with the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enter at the &s;ame time, is not pre|tended to be allow'd, nor is it con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf. 'Tis Prepo&s;terous, and Excentrick, and is De&s;tructive of the very Foundation of the Di&s;&s;enters Principles, as is already noted, concerning Schi&s;ms in the Church. In this Ca&s;e, Charity can heal nothing, nor help no|thing;
<PB N="150" REF="147">
'tis of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that one Man be but of one &s;ide, at one and the &s;ame time. Either the Con|formi&s;t will mar the Di&s;&s;enter, or the Di&s;&s;enter will mar the Conformi&s;t. For if I &s;hall be admitted into the Communion of the Di&s;&s;enter, and of the Church together; then the Di&s;&s;enter mu&s;t have &s;ome other Rea&s;on for being a Di&s;&s;enter, than Purity of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Methinks Men &s;hould &s;eem what they are; if a Man Di&s;&s;ent from the Church, let him do &s;o; and his Principle being well grounded for &s;uch Di&s;&s;ent, let him hold it; if not well-grounded, let him leave it; if he cannot &s;uffer one way, let him &s;uffer another; and why &s;hould we not be as hone&s;t to God as our Coun|try.</P>
<P>The Motives to &s;erve our Country are &s;trong, but there are ways to do it without &s;uch a Violation of all our Principles and Profe&s;&s;ion; if not, tru&s;t God's Providence with the I&s;&s;ue, who never wants Agents to pre&s;erve and deliver his People when his time is at hand; and you can have &s;mall hope to expect that the Office and Tru&s;t you &s;hall Execute, &s;hall receive any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Providence, when the fir&s;t Step into it, is made by offering the greate&s;t Affront to his Honour, and committing the vile&s;t Act of Per|fidy in the World.</P>
<P>But if the gay Pro&s;pect of a great Place, tempt any Per&s;on beyond the Power that God's Grace is pleas'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with, <HI>in that way let him abide,</HI> and not be re-admitted, becau&s;e of his Gold Ring, and Fine Apparel, without a Penitent Acknowledgement. The Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> can never pretend to be Di&s;|&s;enters upon the mere Principle of Purity of Wor&s;hip, as I have related in the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, if &s;uch &s;hall be receiv'd as blamele&s;s into their Com|munion, who have de&s;erted them upon the occa&s;ion of Preferment, and have made the Sacred In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, become Pimps to their Secular Intere&s;t,
<PB N="151" REF="148">
and then wipe their Mouths, and &s;it down in the Church, and &s;ay, <HI>They have done no Evil.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o an Intolerable Affront to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> reflecting upon its Doctrine as well as Pra|ctice; to make u&s;e of the Church for a <HI>Cover</HI> to fence them again&s;t the Laws, at the &s;ame time continuing to di&s;own its Communion, as a thing not fit to be con|tinued in.</P>
<P>And yet the Church of <HI>England</HI> is in the right to receive &s;uch of the Di&s;&s;enters as &s;hall come to them without the Ceremony of Recognition, becau&s;e it is agreeable to the Notion of a National Church, which they profe&s;s to be. But Di&s;&s;enters are bound to ju&s;ti|fie their Separation from them, or el&s;e their whole Con&s;titution falls to the Ground. Now, how a Se|paration and a Conformity are Con&s;i&s;tent, is to me an Inexplicable Riddle.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not here the Lawfulne&s;s of the Di&s;&s;en|ters Separation; it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e to define it; and I am as careful as I can in making Reflections upon either; but I am bold to affirm, That no Di&s;&s;enting Church can with lawful Cau&s;e Separate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> E&s;tabli&s;h Private Chur|ches or Communions, and at the &s;ame times allow the Members to Conform to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church too: This is incongruous, and one mu&s;t de&s;troy the other. From whence I think it becomes the Di&s;&s;enters, if they would maintain the Doctrine they teach; if they would have us believe they Di&s;&s;ent purely on the hone&s;t Principles of Con&s;cience, and Purity of Wor&s;hip, with &s;uch a one, <HI>No, not to Eat.</HI> And it is not &s;ufficient that the Offender a Lord Mayor, or any greater Per&s;on; unle&s;s he would be Lord Mayor without a Breach of the Sacred Relation he had entred into, he &s;hould be dealt with in that Ca&s;e, as the meane&s;t Member of &s;uch a Society.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if a Man be call'd upon to be a
<PB N="152" REF="149">
Magi&s;trate, and has Courage enough to follow the Impartial Dictates of his Con&s;cience, a Query lies be|fore him, What &s;hall he do?</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is plain; <HI>Either refu&s;e the Honour, or run the Ri&s;que.</HI> The fir&s;t indeed is the plaine&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Way, and the Ground of it is good, for he who&s;e Con|cience Dictates to him that the Terms are Sinful, may refu&s;e the Call; for Preferments and Honours are a Bait that &s;ome have refu&s;ed on meer Points of Specu|lative Philo&s;ophy; and 'tis hard, Chri&s;tianity &s;hou'd not carry a Man as far. Well, but <HI>perhaps a Man has a mind to be a Sheriff or a Lord Mayor,</HI> and is a Di&s;&s;en|ter; or perhaps he really thinks 'tis his Indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to &s;erve his Country, if he is call'd to that, or the like Office; or perhaps he thinks 'tis a Duty he owes his Family, to advance his Children, and the like, and he is a Profe&s;t Di&s;&s;enter: What &s;hall he do? Let him boldly run the Ri&s;que, or openly and hone&s;tly Conform to the Church, and neither be a&s;ham'd of his Honour, nor of his Profe&s;&s;ion; &s;uch a Man all Men will Value, and God will own: He need not fear car|ying the Sword to a Conventicle, or bringing the Conventicle to his own Hou&s;e. But to make the mat|ter a Game, to dodge Religions, and go in the Morn|ing to Church, and in the Afternoon to the Meeting; to Communicate in private with the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to &s;ave a Penalty, and then go back to the Di&s;|&s;enters and Communicate again there: This is &s;uch a Retrograde Devotion, that I can &s;ee no colour of pre|tence for in all the Sacred Book.</P>
<P>I have heard, indeed, that &s;ome, who are Mini&s;ters of Di&s;&s;enting Churches do, or did at the &s;ame time Communicate with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I do not di&s;pute how far a Mini&s;ter may Conform as a Lay|man, tho' he cannot as a Clergy-man; but how any Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter can Conform as a Lay-man, and at the &s;ame time execute a Pa&s;toral Charge over a
<PB N="153" REF="150">
Congregation, whom he teaches to Separate from the Church in a Lay-Communion, I cannot imagine.</P>
<P>'Tis not as I have already noted, Conformity or Nonconformity at the &s;ame time, in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on, <HI>that is the Point;</HI> and doing this for a Secular End, to &s;ave a Penalty, and privately; and then, as being a&s;ham'd of it, to go back and &s;it down as not having done it at all; and a Church-Society admitting this without taking notice of it; the&s;e are the Con|tradictions I mu&s;t upon, and rather wi&s;h, than expect to &s;ee rectified.</P>

<P>Now all the&s;e Gentlemen have liv'd to &s;ee them|&s;elves Mi&s;taken; and if they retain any Expectations of &s;eeing it fulfill'd, they mu&s;t exerci&s;e their Faith upon it, as a thing <HI>in Futuro,</HI> and believe that &s;ome time or other Her Maje&s;ty will break her Word; but as yet there is no great Probability, for hitherto we have &s;een we are all mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But to revive their Expectations, comes a Bill into the Hou&s;e for preventing Occa&s;ional Conformity, this has been matter of great Triumph to &s;ome Gentle|men, who upon this Act revive their common Di&s;|cour&s;e, and are pleas'd to treat the Di&s;&s;enters in this manner: <HI>Well, Gentlemen, now down you go, the Parlia|ment are a beginning with you, and they don't u&s;e to do Bu|&s;ine&s;s by halves, they have taken the In&s;ulted Church into Con&s;ideration, they will reduce you, and this is the fir&s;t Step, you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee &s;ome more on't: We have got a Church Parliament now, and down ye go, this Bill will effectually Ruin your Intere&s;t, and bring all your Great Men off from you.</HI></P>

<P>As far as I may be allow'd to give my Judgement, and as the Nature of the Thing &s;eems to &s;peak its &s;elf; 'tis plain this Bill is no Damage at all to the Di&s;|&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> and we hope the Hou&s;e did not intend it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine that &s;o great a Spirit of Enmity and contempt can be entertain'd in the Brea&s;t of a Nation again&s;t their Neighbours, their Brethren, Peo|ple Born in the &s;ame Climate, &s;ubmitting to the &s;ame Government, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame God, and in mo&s;t Fundamental Points of Religion agreeing, People link'd together in the &s;ame common Intere&s;t, by in|termarriages continually mixt in Relation, concern'd in the &s;ame Trade, making War with the &s;ame Ene|mies, and Allied with the &s;ame Friends; were it not that the&s;e People, call'd Di&s;&s;enters, are repre&s;ented to them under &s;ome &s;trange and untrue Character, or that under the Name of Di&s;&s;enter, &s;ome ill Per&s;ons are &s;hrowded and di&s;guis'd, who de&s;erve to be thus Treated.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in order to &s;et the Di&s;&s;enters Right in the Eyes of their Brethren, and that they may have com|mon Ju&s;tice at lea&s;t, if they can have nothing of Cour|te&s;ie, that Peace may be where there is no Occa&s;ion for War, and Quietne&s;s, and good Manners pre&s;er|ved, 'twill be needful to &s;et the Matter in a true Light, and examine who this Di&s;&s;enter is, what the People Di&s;&s;enters are, and what they have done, for which they are Treated after &s;o infamous a Manner by Scurrilous Preachers, and Scandalous Pamphleteers, and other ignorant People, not a few.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enter is an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> that being &s;ome|thing

de&s;irous of going to Heaven, having heard his Church of <HI>England</HI> Father, and School-ma&s;ter, and the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, talk much of it, begins &s;e|riou&s;ly to enquire about the Way thither, and to that Purpo&s;e con&s;ulting his Bible and his Con&s;cience, he finds that in his Opinion there are &s;ome Things in the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Way of Wor&s;hip, which do not &s;eem to corre&s;pond with the Rule he has found out in the Scripture.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall not examine here whether the Man thus &s;crupulous be in the Right, or whether the Church be in the Right, it does not at all belong to the Ca&s;e in Hand.</P>
<P>But the Man being fully convinc'd that he ought to Wor&s;hip God in that Way, exclu&s;ive of all others, which is mo&s;t agreeable to the Will of God reveal'd in the Scripture; and being on mature Con&s;ideration al&s;o, and after &s;incere Endeavours to be otherwi&s;e &s;a|tisfied, fully convinc'd that this E&s;tabli&s;h'd Way is not &s;o near to that Rule as it ought to be, ventures the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Civil Magi&s;trate in Di&s;&s;enting, in pure Obedience to the Commands of his Con&s;cience, and of that Rule which bids him obey God rather than Man; firmly believing that 'tis his Duty &s;o to do; and that the Compa&s;s and Extent of Humane Laws do not reach to bind him in Matters of Con&s;cience; at the &s;ame time living in Charity with all the re&s;t of the World who&s;e Con&s;ciences do not require the &s;ame Re&s;triction, and Peaceably &s;ubmitting to the Laws and Government he lives under, as far as either his Right, as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or his Duty as a Chri&s;tian, can require.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enter which I have been &s;peaking of, and concerning whom I have ven|tur'd to &s;ay, &s;o many Men, <HI>&s;o much Wi&s;er than I,</HI> are Mi&s;taken.</P>

<P>'Tis for the Protection of this Hone&s;t, Well-mea|ning Di&s;&s;enter, that in the late Reign the King and Parliament finding their Number Great, thought it was Meet for the Quiet of the Nation, and as an Ac|knowledgement of the Superiority of Con&s;cience to all Humane Laws, to Settle their Liberty in an Act of Parliament; the &s;ame undi&s;puted Authority on which all our Civil, as well as Religious, Rights are E&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This is the Di&s;&s;enter to which Her Maje&s;ty has promi&s;ed Her Protection, and this Act of Parliament is the Toleration to Tender Con&s;ciences, for which Her Maje&s;ty openly declar'd Her Self, even to the Ha|zard of Her Royal Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Di&s;&s;enters who never gave Her Ma|je&s;ty any Rea&s;on to believe they did not Merit Her Protection, and I firmly believe never will.</P>
<P>From the&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI> has nothing to fear, unle&s;s their Exemplary Lives, and Unque&s;tion'd Piety, &s;hou'd prevail to weaken Her Numbers, and we heartily wi&s;h all the Strife were reduc'd to this, <HI>viz.</HI> who &s;hou'd Live be&s;t, and who &s;hou'd Preach be&s;t.</P>

<P>If we regard the Matters of State, the Di&s;&s;enters, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have &s;mall Advantage of the Argument one again&s;t another; and I may with|out Arrogance Challenge the Hot Church-Men, who can Treat them with nothing but the Odious Name of Di&s;turbers of the Peace, Enemies of Monarchy, and Authors of Confu&s;ion, to bring the Loyalty of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o much boa&s;ted of in the World, to the Te&s;t, with the Loyalty of the Di&s;&s;enter; <NOTE PLACE="marg">New Te&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty. <HI>P.</HI></NOTE> and as it has lately been done to my Hand, it is ea&s;ie to prove that the Di&s;&s;enter has been equally Loyal to Princes, equally True to the Government and Con&s;tituti|on of <HI>England,</HI> as the Church; and the Church has been equally Di&s;loyal, and has as often Re|&s;i&s;ted, and took Arms again&s;t the Lawful E&s;tabli&s;h'd Power and Prince, as the Di&s;&s;enter; and let them en|ter into this Di&s;pute whenever they plea&s;e.</P>

<P>And what need is there now of running down the Di&s;&s;enters with a full Cry, as if this Act a coming out was a Machine to blow them all up; we &s;ee no Harm in it at all, other than the Hard&s;hips we mention'd be|fore, mo&s;t of which we &s;uffer'd before, and are like

<P>They have try'd it in the Pulpit, &s;catter'd it in Scandalous Pamphlets from the Pre&s;s, affirmed that Toleration is De&s;tructive of the Churches, as well as the Nations Safety; they have endeavour'd, by Ca|lumny and Reproach to blacken the Di&s;&s;enters with Crimes never committed; and which they wou'd ne|ver own before, are at la&s;t come to repre&s;ent them as a formidable Party.</P>
<P>And yet all this cou'd never bring &s;o much as One Member of the Hou&s;e to be &s;o blind to his Countries Intere&s;t, as to make a Motion again&s;t the Act of Toleration.</P>

<P>When Her Maje&s;ty was Prince&s;s, and a Subject, &s;he con&s;tantly adher'd to the Intere&s;t of the Church; but at the &s;ame time declar'd Her Opinion for tolerating the Di&s;&s;enters in their Liberty of Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip, while they behaved them&s;elves quietly and obediently under the Government.</P>
<P>When Her Maje&s;ty came to the Crown, She became the general Mother, the Guardian, the Refuge of all Her Subjects; She places the Church fir&s;t in Her Fa|vour, promi&s;es them Her &s;pecial and particular care, as tho&s;e who by Judgment and Inclination She &s;tands engaged with; but as She finds a great Number of Her People unhappily divided in Opinion, yet in all other Re&s;pects Her good Subjects, what can She do le&s;s than give them Her Protection? This She has readily promis'd them, and on this they thankfully depend,</P>
<P>But here comes the Gentlemen of the Long Gown, and they tell her in &s;o many Words, She cannot, She mu&s;t not keep her Word with us; They tell us She will halt between God and <HI>Baal,</HI> if She does not &s;o De|clare for the Church, as to her Be&s;t to Suppre&s;s and de&s;troy all Separate Wor&s;hips, and have all the Prie&s;ts
<PB N="169" REF="166">
of <HI>Baal,</HI> the be&s;t Terms they can be&s;tow on the Di&s;|&s;enting Mini&s;ters, hew'd to Pieces before the Lord.</P>
<P>'Tis Unmannerly that the Church of <HI>England-</HI>men &s;hou'd expect the Queen to break Her word with &s;ome of Her Subjects to oblige others; and that whereas She has promis'd them Her Special Favour, they &s;hou'd not be content with that, unle&s;s She will at the &s;ame time Oppre&s;s Two Millions of her Faithful People to oblige them.</P>
<P>Let them go on, but let them be a&s;&s;ur'd the Di&s;&s;en|ters &s;hall enjoy their Liberty of Con&s;cience, till they can prevail with Her Maje&s;ty to lay a&s;ide her Veraci|ty, and forget Her Royal Word, and refu&s;e us Her Protection, which we are re&s;olved never to give Her any Rea&s;on for.</P>
<P>As to the Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity, it baulks their De&s;ign on the Di&s;&s;enters, for 'tis for their Advantage; they always di&s;lik'd the Practice; it has more than once been Prote&s;ted again&s;t, and Exploded, and I dare undertake not one Di&s;&s;enter offers to pre&s;ent a Petition to the Hou&s;e again&s;t its pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that Occa&s;ional Communion is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a Di&s;&s;enter; who, if he can Conform, ought to Conform; and if he can for a Place of Preferment, ought to do it without that Preferment.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that whatever, by the Connivance of Remi&s;s Mini&s;ters, and with too much Regard to Par|ties, may have been &s;lightly pa&s;s'd over, yet by the ve|ry Con&s;titution and Foundation of a collected, &s;eparate Church or Congregation, no Man can go back to the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and be recei|ved again upon any other Condition but as a Penitent; 'tis an Act De&s;tructive of all po&s;&s;ible Pretence for Di&s;|&s;enting and never was, nor never can, be defended by any Di&s;&s;enter, without over-throwing all the Rea&s;ons they cou'd ever give for Di&s;&s;enting.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="167">
How then can this Bill be aim'd at the Di&s;&s;enters? either they who think 'tis aim'd at them, are Mi&s;ta|ken; or they that point it at them, are Mi&s;taken, for Suppre&s;&s;ing an Error crept in among them, contrary to their Con&s;titution, again&s;t their Judgment, decla|red by them to be a Grievance, can never be their In|jury, nor ought to be their Trouble.</P>
<P>Let them Name us the Di&s;&s;enter that ever vindica|ted this Practice, one pa&s;&s;ionate Author excepted; let them tell us the Time when any Congregation recei|ved &s;uch conforming Nonconformati&s;ts without di&s;&s;a|tisfactions and Di&s;contents; let them tell us a Time whenever the thing was practic'd till the Reign of King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a Novelty, an Abu&s;e crept in among us, and we are glad to have it Condemn'd by Authority; at the &s;ame Time not at all thinking our &s;elves oblig'd to the Authors for their Good Will.</P>
<P>'Twill be objected, this is a Feint, to clo&s;e with a thing when you cannot help it.</P>
<P>No, Gentlemen, we don't tell you we like that part of the Bill which Excludes us from the Native Honours and Preferments of our Country, which are our Due, our Birthright, equally with our Neighbours, and to which we &s;hould be call'd by the Suffrage of the People; and we cannot but think it a Hard&s;hip beyond the Power of Rea&s;on to ju&s;tifie; but &s;ince this Right mu&s;t be clogg'd with &s;o many Inconveniencies, that we mu&s;t Mortgage our Con&s;ciences to enjoy them, no Man can have any Charity left for us, but mu&s;t pre&s;ently conclude we &s;hall freely forego &s;uch Trifles for our Con&s;ciences, or el&s;e that we may have no Con&s;ciences at all.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>'tis no Feint;</HI> we are &s;o content with the Suppre&s;&s;ing the Grievance of this Scandalous <HI>Am|bo-dexter Conformity,</HI> that we think the Hard&s;hips put upon us with it not worth naming; we doubt not

the Parliament will one time or other &s;ee Cau&s;e to do us Ju&s;tice, and to re&s;tore to us the Priviledges of our Ance&s;tors, and which we have done nothing to for|feit.</P>
<P>But all the Parliaments that ever were, or will be, can never Suppre&s;s any thing among us &s;o Scandalous to our Reputation, and to that Candour with which we de&s;ire to Guide our Actions, nor &s;o Contrary to, and De&s;tructive of, the very Nature of our &s;eparating from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Con&s;titution of all our Collected Congregations.</P>
<P>We acknowledge, that if this was an allow'd Pra|ctice among us, we cou'd not pretend the Character of a Di&s;&s;enter I have here given to be Ju&s;t; but with|out Que&s;tion it is a mo&s;t Ju&s;t Character of all tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who are Con&s;ciencious and Hone&s;t; 'tis the Original, the Nature, of a Di&s;&s;enter; what is crept in more is a Corruption, and we wi&s;h it Extin|gui&s;hed; and &s;ince none has &s;aid any thing of this Nature but what has been &s;aid before, and no Church of <HI>England-</HI>Man can think or &s;peak wor&s;e of it than the truly Religious Di&s;&s;enters have done, we freely di&s;mi&s;s all tho&s;e who can thus Build with one Hand, and Pull Down with another, to a Liberty of declar|ing for the future who they are for.</P>
<P>Only pur&s;uant to what has all along been acknow|ledg'd, &s;o far as we handl'd this Argument, if they wou'd accept of the Friendly Advice of their Bre|thren, it &s;hould be, that they would for the future Conform to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For 'tis plain, he that can Conform to the Church to qualifie him&s;elf for Preferment, for Employment, or any &s;uch Rea&s;on, can Conform; if not, he mu&s;t be arrived to a Degree of Ma&s;ter&s;hip over his Con&s;cience &s;o as to &s;ubject it to his Intere&s;t, and act again&s;t light; and he that can do that, may do any thing, and 'tis no matter what Church he communicates with; of &s;uch

<P>But if any Man who has profe&s;t him&s;elf a Religious Di&s;&s;enter, &s;hall, upon the pa&s;&s;ing this Act, declare him|&s;elf Re&s;olv'd to turn to the Di&s;&s;enters, I think no Con|gregation of Di&s;&s;enters, according to the Nature of Religious Communion, can receive him upon any o|ther Terms than as a <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If he has not Sinn'd, why &s;hou'd he Repent?</HI> Says a Lear|ned Author in this very Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, he either has Sinn'd in Conforming, or he Sinn'd in Di&s;&s;enting before, or he Sins in coming off; for if he did not Sin in Conforming, he ought to have continued there, and his coming off is a plain Schi&s;m; but if he did Sin, he ought to acknowledge the Sin, which is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent.</P>
<P>I am told after all this, but upon what Authority do you write thus? You take upon you to write in the Name of the Di&s;&s;enters, what Commi&s;&s;ion have you to write in the Plural? And how do we know that the Di&s;&s;enters di&s;own this Occa&s;ional Commu|nion.</P>

<P>And yet I am not without a general Concurrence of all the Di&s;&s;enters I ever conver&s;t with: and he that can an&s;wer the Argument is welcome to Make his Ne|gative as Publick as this, and let the World judge who is in the Right.</P>

of Kingly Power, and the Government of the Nation.</P>
<P>This has been the Opinion of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> both of them&s;elves on one Hand, and of the Di&s;|&s;enters on the other Hand. I &s;hou'd be glad if I cou'd only &s;ay, <HI>It has been,</HI> for we find 'tis &s;till too much their Opinion.</P>
<P>Let no Man &s;ay that the Author of the&s;e Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation; for if I can make it appear that there is really no Occa&s;ion of &s;uch unnatural Divi&s;ions; and that neither the extraordinary Opinion of them&s;elves, nor the Contempt of their Neighbours, as to the mat|ter of Loyalty, is a becoming Principle; no, nor a ra|tional one neither: For that as to Loyalty, Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is really no great Difference between one &s;ide or other; I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man; for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both Sides, than to prove that neither Side has any ju&s;t Cau&s;e to contend.</P>

<P>The Government of <HI>England,</HI> is a limited Monar|chy, compo&s;ed of King, Lords, and Commons; each have their &s;everal, their &s;eparate, and their conjunctive Powers; which acting in Concert, make the Harmo|ny of the Con&s;titution. I &s;hall not invade the Pro|vince of tho&s;e learned Gentlemen, who have underta|ken to &s;et forth the Branches of the Con&s;titution in all their Powers, Limitations and Prerogatives: 'Tis enough to &s;ay the Con&s;titution is known, the Govern|ment is confin'd by Laws, the Crown limited by Sta|tutes, and the Peoples Rights confirm'd by the Conce&s;&s;i|on of Ages.</P>

<P>Affirming without demon&s;trating is an ab&s;urd way of arguing, and therefore it will be needful to come to Particulars, and to examine the &s;everal Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has &s;hock'd or cla&s;h'd with the People.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis needful co examine the Date of the Difference, and &s;o enter a little into Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. I call it the fir&s;t, becau&s;e 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Go|vernment embrac'd the Prote&s;tant Reform'd Religion; this Prote&s;tant Religion was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by <HI>that Zea|lous King,</HI> and by his Parliament, back'd with the force of Laws, and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Autho|rity it was capable of, and here it began to be call'd the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Some enquiring Chri&s;tians were for making farther Steps, and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree; and if that good reforming King had liu'd, his Zeal and Integrity was &s;uch, that there was no doubt he wou'd have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun, as new Light or more Knowledge had encrea&s;ed; but the Return of Popery under Queen <HI>Mary</HI> put a Stop to the Work in general, and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> re&s;tor'd it again; but as &s;he was a Zealous Prote&s;tant Queen, yet &s;he was not for &s;ub|jecting the Reformation to any Amendment. Not that &s;he believ'd it perfect; but &s;he was a Politick Prince&s;s, &s;urrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with; and &s;he was loth to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch De|fects
<PB N="178" REF="175">
in the Reformation as were alledg'd, becau&s;e 'twas to le&s;&s;en the Reputation of it, and con&s;equently her Intere&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;ted upon the further Reformation were then call'd <HI>Puritans,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;et up for a greater Purity of Wor&s;hip; and they &s;eparated them|&s;elves from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid, their Con&s;ciences inform'd them they cou'd &s;erve God more agreeable to his Will.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not meddle with the Arguments made u&s;e of on both Sides, either to defend or expo&s;e this Prin|ciple; 'tis &s;ufficient to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Di&s;&s;enters: We are now to examine a little further back. Before this Refor|mation there was no &s;uch thing as Church of <HI>England,</HI> it was then the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> that was the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd National Church.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants under the Titles of <HI>Lollards, Wick|liffians, Hu&s;&s;ites,</HI> &amp;c. what did they do? Did they, <HI>as our Modern People &s;ay every Body &s;hou'd,</HI> conform to what the Government commanded? No, the pre&s;ent Church of <HI>England</HI> Party were the Di&s;&s;enters, the Schi&s;maticks and Phanaticks, in the Days of King <HI>Hen|ry</HI> VIII. were per&s;ecuted for not coming to Church, many of them put to Death, and always treated with Scorn and Contempt, as Enemies to the Government, Broachers of new Opinions, and Contemners of Au|thority, as in the Ca&s;e of that Famous Proto-Martyr of Chri&s;t's Church, <HI>John Lambert,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>In the next Ages the&s;e come to have the Power in their Hands, and forgetting that they had found it <HI>Righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man,</HI> they treat tho&s;e who&s;e Con&s;ciences oblige them to di&s;|&s;ent from them with the &s;ame Contempt which them|&s;elves had receiv'd from the <HI>Roman</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Thus far they are upon even Terms, as to Obedi|ence to their Superiors.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="176">
The Di&s;&s;enters have the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion after this to &s;how their Submi&s;&s;ion under extraordinary Pre&s;&s;ures. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> di&s;countenanc'd them continually, and as good a Queen as &s;he was, put &s;ome of them to Death. King <HI>James</HI> I. hunted them quite out of the Kingdom, made Thou&s;ands of them fly into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germa|ny,</HI> and at la&s;t to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>During the long Reign of the&s;e Two Princes we find no charge of Trea&s;on or Rebellion upon them; they bore the Di&s;plea&s;ure of their Princes with Pati|ence and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, <HI>if I may be allow'd that Ri|diculous Phra&s;e;</HI> being per&s;ecuted in one City, they fled to another; they bore illegal Pro&s;ecutions, and things contrary to their Right, as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, but never took up Arms again&s;t their Prince.</P>
<P>Under the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Ca&s;e alter'd, the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Ci|vil Right, and Inva&s;ion of the Liberty and Properties of the People, the <HI>Puritans</HI> or Di&s;&s;enters, call them what we plea&s;e, fell in unanimou&s;ly with the Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>And here 'tis worthy Remark, that the fir&s;t Diffe|rence between the King and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament did not Re&s;pect Religion but Civil Property; nor were the Majority of the Hou&s;e <HI>Puritans,</HI> but true Church Prote&s;tants, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who &s;tood up|on the Rights of the People, as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; and none were more Zealous in the fir&s;t Di&s;putes than the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> and &s;uch as were after|wards deep Sufferers for the King.</P>
<P>But the Parliament finding the <HI>Puritan</HI> Party &s;tuck clo&s;e to their Cau&s;e, they al&s;o came over them when Things came to a Rupture, and &s;o the War begun on the Score of Right, Inva&s;ion of Liberty, Breach of the Laws, Private Leagues, and Male-Admini&s;tration, a Game we have &s;een play'd over again by the very &s;ame Church of <HI>England</HI> that have exclaim'd &s;o much again&s;t

it, &s;o damn'd it, and &s;o damn'd them&s;elves, by Oaths, Declarations, Te&s;ts, and God knows what again&s;t it.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loy|alty, and his former Obedience, and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded. Well, the War ended to his Advantage, he &s;ubdued his Soveraign, and brought him to the Block, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of the whole World.</P>
<P>I won't di&s;pute here which or which Party did or did not do it; but to give the Enemy all ju&s;t Advan|tage, I am willing to grant it in the large&s;t Sence that the Di&s;&s;enters, or Phanaticks, or Whigs, call them as you plea&s;e, did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed, put to Death that Ble&s;&s;ed Martyr, King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. whom the Learned Divine, in a Sermon on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> before the Parliament, compares both in the manner of his Sufferings, and the People by whom, to our Saviour and the Jews, and boldly runs on in the Bla&s;phemous Parallel, to &s;hew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King <HI>Charles</HI> ex|ceed tho&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>Nor &s;hall I return to a Repetition of the ill U&s;age the Di&s;&s;enters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Account for above 30 Years; the con&s;tant Re|proaches they and their Children after them have met with from tho&s;e Gentlemen, who on all Occa&s;ions have (as I hinted before) particularly taken care to extol their own un&s;haken Fidelity to their Prince, till at la&s;t an Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents to touch them in the &s;ame mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, <HI>their Right and Property;</HI> and <HI>alas!</HI> Their Loyalty, what became of it? Truly the <HI>Faith|ful, Pa&s;&s;ively Obedient, &V;n&s;hakenly Loyal,</HI> Church, re|turn'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours, and did the &s;ame thing exactly which the Whigs, <HI>the Factious Rebellious Whigs,</HI> had done before.</P>

<P>No, that's true, but the Lords Anointed may thank him&s;elf for that; for my part I think the Difference only lyes here; the Whigs in 41, to 48, took up Arms again&s;t their King, and having Conquer'd him, and ta|ken him Pri&s;oner, and having taken him Pri&s;oner, cut off his Head, <HI>becau&s;e they had begun:</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> took Arms again&s;t their King in 88, and did not cut off his Head, <HI>becau&s;e they had him not.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> lo&s;t his Life, <HI>becau&s;e he did not run away;</HI> and his Son, King <HI>James,</HI> &s;av'd his Life, <HI>becau&s;e he did run away.</HI></P>

<P>If a Highway-man Fires at you upon the Road, when he is taken, and brought upon his Trial, our Learned Recorder, before he pronounces Sentence of Death, Harangues him in this manner: <HI>And be&s;ides all this, Sir, you are plainly guilty of Murther; for you not only a&s;&s;aulted this Hone&s;t Man in order to take away his Money, but you endeavoured to Murther him; for you &s;hot at him in order to kill him; and the Intention of Murther is equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it &s;elf.</HI></P>

<P>Nay, if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both &s;ides, the Whigs have been the ho|ne&s;ter of the two, for they never profe&s;t any &s;uch blind, ab&s;olute and undi&s;puted Obedience to Princes, as the others have done.</P>
<P>It has always been their Opinion, That Govern|ment was Originally contrived by the Con&s;ent, and for the mutual Benefit of the Parties Govern'd, that the People have an Original Native Right to their Property, the Liberty of their Per&s;ons and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons, <HI>unle&s;s forefaulted to the Laws;</HI> that they cannot be dive&s;ted of their Right but by their own Con&s;ent; and that all Inva&s;ion of this Right is de&s;tructive of the Con&s;titution, and di&s;&s;olves the Compact of Govern|ment and Obedience.</P>
<P>They have always declar'd, That they under&s;tand their Allegiance to their Governors to be, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land;</HI> and that if Princes break this Bond of Government, the Nature of it is inverted, and the Con&s;titution cea&s;es of cour&s;e.</P>

<P>This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Di&s;&s;en|ters, and is indeed the true Sen&s;e of the Con&s;titution it &s;elf; pur&s;uant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppo&s;e Violence with Force; believ|ing that when Kings break Coronation Oaths, the Solemn Compact with their People, and encroach up|on their Civil Rights, contrary to the Laws of the Land, by which they are Sworn to Rule, they cea&s;e to be the Lord's Anointed any longer; the Sanction of their Office is vani&s;h'd, and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Mankind, and may be treated accordingly.</P>

<P>The Clergy, all the Magi&s;trates and Officers of the Hou&s;hold, of the Civil or Military Government, were Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> otherwi&s;e they cou'd not be employ'd; the Sacramental Te&s;t has done the Di&s;&s;enters this Kindne&s;s, that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the Kingdom were Di&s;ciples of the Church; and as an additional Circum&s;tance, the Oath of Allegiance which they took, and which
<PB N="185" REF="182">
was (God be prai&s;ed) of their own making, bound them to that &s;ame Ab&s;olute Blind Obedience which they profe&s;t, and confin'd it to the King, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>If this Oath be con&s;ider'd literally, I am content to be &s;ilenc'd when one fair Argument can be brought to evade it; the Declaration follow'd it, wherein they dete&s;t and abhor that devili&s;h Doctrine, that 'tis law|ful <HI>on any Pretence what&s;oever, (Mark the Empha&s;is)</HI> to take up Arms again&s;t the King; this <HI>(equal to an Oath)</HI> declar'd in the Pre&s;ence of God, and the Particulars being material to our Purpo&s;e, are as follows:
<Q>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do Declare and Believe that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence what&s;oever to take up Arms again&s;t the King, and that I do abhor that Traiterous Po&s;ition of taking Arms by his Authority again&s;t tho&s;e that are com|mi&s;&s;ioned by him.<P>So help me God.</P></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, you have taken up Arms a|gain&s;t, depo&s;ed, and as far as you were able, put to Death your lawful King, the very King you &s;wore Al|legiance to.</P>
<P>Now <HI>pray Gentlemen give Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome worthy Champion of your Church's Loyalty to bring you &s;airly off of your Oath and Declaration if you can;</HI> and till you do, be not angry with us for making one of the&s;e Con|clu&s;ions from the Premi&s;es, and you &s;hall chu&s;e for your &s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That this Doctrine of Ab&s;olute, Pa&s;&s;ive and Non-re&s;i&s;tant Obedience, is an Ab&s;urdity in it &s;elf, contradictory to the Nature of Government and Al|legiance, and politically introduc'd by State Engines into the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to abu&s;e her, and betray her Members into unfore&s;een Mi&s;chiefs and Inconve|niences.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="183">
Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are all Apo&s;tates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church, Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man, Notorious Hypocrites, and Decei|vers; who having &s;worn Obedience without Re&s;erve to their Prince, are become Traitors, Rebels, and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed, and their Law|ful Soveraign; and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, have depos'd and traiterou&s;ly dethron'd their Rightful King, God Almighty's Vicegerent, ac|countable to no Earthly Power, Supream under God, Ab&s;olute, and, from Divine In&s;titution, Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country.</P>
<P>Or, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That they only are the true Church of <HI>England,</HI> who according to their avow'd Profe&s;&s;ion, have firmly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude, have never blacken'd their Con&s;ciences, nor gone back from their Obedience, forgotten their Oaths, nor &s;ullied their Reputation with the horrid Crimes of Trea&s;on and Rebellion, as they think it to be.</P>
<P>Now, as a fair Di&s;putant, I am willing the Re&s;pon|dent &s;hall chu&s;e which of the&s;e three Con&s;equences he will &s;tand by in Behalf of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty; but if they wou'd take the Advice of <HI>a Friend to the Hone&s;t Part of them,</HI> I wou'd recommend the fir&s;t Conclu&s;ion to be fitte&s;t for them for the fol|lowing Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e &s;ince Humane Infallibility is <HI>(and with good Rea&s;on)</HI> di&s;own'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both for her &s;elf and every Body el&s;e, it can be no Dimi|nution to her Reputation, when &s;he has found her &s;elf mi&s;taken, and impos'd upon, to acknowledge her Er|ror; <HI>a wi&s;e Man will always own, rather than defend a Mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up again&s;t any other Pretence, Eva&s;ion, or
<PB N="187" REF="184">
Re&s;ervation, and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can &s;ay for them, and mu&s;t remain &s;o, till I find &s;omething el&s;e &s;aid that is more to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;chief of all is, that if this be hone&s;tly acknowledg'd <HI>(as is doubtle&s;s mo&s;t true)</HI> that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was mi&s;taken, and impos'd upon, to e&s;pou&s;e a Sen&s;le&s;s Ab&s;urd Principle, contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> why then they come over to this Con&s;equence;</P>
<P>That Government and Allegiance are both Condi|tional, and Oaths of Subjects are always to be con&s;i|der'd in a Con&s;tructive Sence, with Conditions of Pro|tection, and the like; a thing which is without que&s;tion the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance; other|wi&s;e Subjects may be put under an Ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Perjury, or State Martyrdom, by often Swearing what may be impo&s;&s;ible for them to perform.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Aeth</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> has been about Six Times, and the Town of <HI>Rhinebergh</HI> in <HI>Gueldre</HI> about Twelve Times, Taken and Retaken; and as often as new Ma&s;ters had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place, &s;o often the poor Inhabitants have &s;worn to their new Lords: What can the Meaning of &s;uch an Oath be, but that they will be faithful to them &s;o long as they keep Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place? 'Twou'd be ridiculous to imagine the Impo&s;ers of the Oath requir'd any more.</P>
<P>If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contra|ry to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance, let them an&s;wer for it who fir&s;t made it, then took it, then broke it: But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Sugge&s;tion that I know of.</P>
<P>Till then &s;ome further Argument is produc'd, it mu&s;t re&s;t here, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was Mi|&s;taken, Impo&s;ed upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that &s;he finds when the Laws are Broken, the Right of the People Invaded, the Root of the Government Struck at, Church and State Undermin'd, and De&s;potick Tyranny at the
<PB N="188" REF="185">
Door, the Native Right of the People is Superior, and they may a&s;&s;ume a Power to Right them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>And &s;o we are brought back to Whiggi&s;m and Forty. One; and Gentlemen, there is no Remedy for it, help it if ye can.</HI></P>
<P>Where now is the Difference between Church Loy|alty, and Whiggi&s;h Loyalty, Roundhead or Cavalier, Churchman or Di&s;&s;enter, Whig or Troy? All are alike; they are pleas'd, when legally Govern'd, Quar|rel&s;ome and Unruly, if Oppre&s;t; and will Defend them&s;elves, if A&s;&s;aulted, tho' it be by their Kings, or any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Why then is the Difference kept up? Methinks they might all be Friends together, for they are all alike; the Di&s;&s;enters have been in their times as Loyal, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their time as Di&s;loyal, one as another. <HI>Vice ver&s;a;</HI> the Di&s;&s;enters have been as Di&s;loyal, and the Churchmen as Loyal, as one another upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion; they have been both Suf|ferers, and have &s;ubmitted to the Government; ay, and to the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Per&s;ecutions of their Su|periors and Soveraigns; and again, upon the like Oc|ca&s;ions, they have both of them been Rebels. <HI>if their own Language may be &s;o far u&s;ed;</HI> they have both of them, in their Turn, taken Arms again&s;t, and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings.</P>
<P>So that in my Opinion, <HI>with a Latitude to all that think otherwi&s;e, to think as they plea&s;e,</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and their Neighbours the Di&s;&s;enters, have nothing to quarrel with one another about, as to Loy|alty; as to other Matters I have nothing to &s;ay to them, nor &s;hall not mingle it with this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr again&s;t the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor is it at all intended to be &s;o; and to &s;top all Pretences that way, I take the Free|dom to &s;ay, here has been no Crime, the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been in the right of it; not in taking Arms, but the Error was in E&s;pou&s;ing, Crying up, and
<PB N="189" REF="186">
Pretending to a Blind Ab&s;olute Obedience to Princes, be their Commands never &s;o Ab&s;olute, Tyrannical or Illegal; this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor of any Church or People in the Chri&s;tian World, ever pretended to; and there|fore the Fanlt lay in tho&s;e People, who being them|&s;elves Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be deluded by State Mini&s;ters, to fo&s;ter a Tenent upon the Church, which her Original Con|&s;titution never pretended to, and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in <HI>Manwaring</HI>'s and <HI>Sibthorp</HI>'s Libels, in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. cajoling the King; and then to plea&s;e him, endeavouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Govern|ment; and affirming, that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Admini&s;tration of the Government.</P>
<P>Upon this prepo&s;terons Foundation they built the Illegitimate Structure of Ab&s;olute Undi&s;puted Obedi|ence; for if Kingly Power were once prov'd to be im|mediately deriv'd from Divine Authority, Ab&s;olute Obedience wou'd be a Con&s;equence no Body cou'd di&s;pute, &s;ince the &s;ame Obedience without Re&s;erve wou'd be due to the Delegated Power, as to the Power Delegating.</P>
<P>And tho' this is a Point ea&s;ily enough confuted, yet being willing to keep the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute within as &s;mall a Compa&s;s we can, I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it.</P>
<P>Whether Government be of Divine Original or not, &s;eems not the Que&s;tion here; for if it be not &s;o, then, as before, the Church of <HI>England</HI> have been Mi&s;taken, and Impo&s;ed upon; and if it be &s;o, then the Church of <HI>England</HI> has trampled under Foot their own Doctrine, turn'd Rebels to God, and Apo&s;tates from the Faith they have profe&s;t, have Sacrilegiou&s;ly and Traiterou&s;ly

taken up Arms again&s;t their Prince, a&s;&s;aulted the Lords Anointed, <HI>re&s;i&s;ted the Powers, which are the Ordi|nance of God,</HI> depo&s;ed their Lawful Soveraign, broken their Allegiance, and con&s;equently <HI>are a Parcel of Per|jur'd Rebels;</HI> every Jot as bad as the wor&s;t Roundhead Regicide, and Rebel of the Year Forty-One.</P>
<P>What more or le&s;s can be &s;aid I profe&s;s I know not, and am in great Expectation of &s;omething new in the Matter; for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with, any thing to contradict it.</P>
<P>The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circum&s;tances of mutual Compact between King and People, &s;eems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles; the Na|ture of Government has made it the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence of all Argument relating to Power; and I cou'd give In&s;tances in all the Nations in the World, that &s;ome time or other, even the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to Government, <HI>which mu&s;t be as Sacred as the Power,</HI> has been Interrupted and Limited by the People, in ca&s;e of Tyranny and Illegal Governing; and every Nati|on, <HI>and this among the re&s;t,</HI> has oftentimes Depos'd their Princes for the Pre&s;ervation of the State, when either Incapacity for Government, Tyrannical U&s;ur|pation, or other Male-Admini&s;tration, has been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But this I think al&s;o needle&s;s here; every one that is vers'd in Hi&s;tory can read the numerous Examples in the <HI>Roman, Grecian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hi&s;tories, <HI>even Sacred Hi&s;tories, where Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where,</HI> are full of them; the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Spain, Portugal, France, Lombardy,</HI> the Empires of <HI>Ger|many</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> even the Papal Chair, have &s;uffer'd Convul&s;ions and Revolutions, the Depo&s;ing and Di&s;|placing their Soveraigns, when the Peoples Good, <HI>which is, and ever was, the Soul, the Center, the End, and the Cau&s;e of all Government,</HI> came to be in the Di&s;pute.</P>

<P>All this is too plain to admit of a Di&s;pute; and now to me it &s;eems Prepo&s;terous why any Men &s;hou'd keep up the Di&s;tinction between Parties as to Loyalty, when indeed there is no manner of Difference in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I have talk'd &s;everal times of Bearing, Suffering, being Per&s;ecuted and Oppre&s;s'd, as the Di&s;&s;enters in their time have been more than enough, and again in their Turn the Church of <HI>England</HI> have been Per|&s;ecuted too; for as I noted before, they were once the <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> the <HI>Whigs,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> Now I think 'tis not very foreign to my Argument to exa|mine whether of the Two behav'd them&s;elves under their Sufferings with the greate&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion, who &s;how'd mo&s;t Ab&s;olute Obedience to their Superiors, and who <HI>fir&s;t, or oftene&s;t, rebell'd</HI> again&s;t their Lawful Soveraign.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. were the fir&s;t Di&s;&s;enters; they were kept Under, Per&s;ecuted, and put to Death as Rebels and Schi&s;maticks. Now up|on due Search it will be fouhd, that under the Pro|tection of Two Prote&s;tant Queens, Wives of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. they had more than once form'd &s;uch In|tere&s;t at Court, and in the Kingdom, as to begin to be formidable to the Popi&s;h Powers then reigning; and the Fall of the Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> was thought a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Policy in King <HI>Henry,</HI> to prevent the Plots of the <HI>Phanatical Church of</HI> England <HI>Hereticks;</HI> a long Ac|count

of which may be read in the Life of that Prince.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. a Zealous and pious Prince, made no Scruple for the <HI>Propagation</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> of which he was the Glorious Founder, to &s;et A&s;ide the Lawful and Undi&s;puted Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of his own Si&s;ters, to E&s;tabli&s;h the Crown in the Lady <HI>Jane Grey,</HI> who he knew wou'd carry on the Work of Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>There's an In&s;tance of the Zeal for Succe&s;&s;ion in the Right Line in the Fir&s;t Prote&s;tant Head that ever the Church of</HI> England <HI>had.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Go&s;pellers, <HI>that is, the Church of</HI> England <HI>Prote&s;tants of</HI> Suffolk, having &s;ome Sen&s;e of Injury done to the <HI>Prince&s;s Mary,</HI> and willing to have the Succe&s;&s;ion go on in the Right Line, provided they cou'd both pre&s;erve their Religion and Loyalty too; Capitulate with her, and promi&s;e to &s;tand by her, pro|vided &s;he wou'd promi&s;e to pre&s;erve, and make no Alteration, in their E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men own'd the Liber|ty of their Religion to be Superior to their Loyalty to her; and that they had a Right to Submit, or not to Submit, as their Liberty was, or was not, Secure: and accordingly Condition'd with her before they wou'd Acknowledge her to be their Queen.</P>
<P>And we &s;ee how Heaven puni&s;h'd them for venturing on the Word of a <HI>Prince</HI> when their Religion and Li|berty was at Stake.</P>
<P>In this Queen's Time the Church having been again Suppre&s;s'd, and Popery Erected, Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat,</HI> an hone&s;t Church of <HI>England</HI> Prote&s;tant, with a very good Body of Men, took up Arms again&s;t their Lawful Prince&s;s for breaking her Word, in Defence of their <HI>Dear Religion E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Ble&s;&s;ed King</HI> Edward, which were the very Words of the Manife&s;to they Publi&s;h'd: The Londoners, with 800 Men &s;ent by the Queen a|gain&s;t

gain&s;t them, thought it no Treachery to De&s;ert their Lawful Popi&s;h Queen, and go over to their Prote&s;tant Church of <HI>England</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P>We have nothing to do with the Ju&s;tification of this Fact, 'tis &s;ufficient that &s;o it was, and that the&s;e were Prote&s;tants of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t part of their Principles, and let them ju&s;tifie the Fact if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Succeeds, and then the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hone in its Meridian Glory; and then grew up &s;ome, who aiming, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> at a further Reformation, and the Church refu&s;ing to hearken to it, form'd a new Party of Di&s;&s;enters, and the&s;e were call'd <HI>Puritans,</HI> and &s;ince that <HI>Phanaticks.</HI></P>
<P>Now I Challenge the Defender of this Cau&s;e to tell me one Di&s;loyal Act, one Plot again&s;t the Govern|ment, one Di&s;turbance of the Civil Peace, among the&s;e Di&s;&s;enters, from the beginning of this Queen, which was their own beginning, to the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. which was a continued Term of 80 Years; and yet, during this time, they &s;uffer'd all manner of Indignities, Reproaches, Fining, Impri|&s;onings, Bani&s;hment, Confi&s;cations, and Corporal Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>So that hitherto the Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience of the Di&s;|&s;enters hath far exceeded that of the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The&s;e had but Five Years Oppre&s;&s;ion under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and in that Five Years they once Capi|tulated with their Soveraign to make her Queen upon Conditions, and once took Arms again&s;t her after &s;he was Queen; and <HI>by that</HI> I mu&s;t always under&s;tand, that if they did not Depo&s;e and De&s;troy her, it was becau&s;e they cou'd not; <HI>and if they had done it, no doubt they had Cau&s;e &s;ufficient to Ju&s;tifie them before God and Man.</HI> The <HI>Puritans</HI> after this &s;uffered all that their <HI>too cruel Brethren</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> laid upon them during Three tedious Reigns, before
<PB N="195" REF="192">
they &s;o much as made the lea&s;t offer at doing them|&s;elves Ju&s;tice; and for 80 Years together exercis'd that <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> which they never pretended to.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they took Arms, and when they did, they did it to purpo&s;e, carried all before them, &s;ubdued Monar|chy, cut off their Kings Head, and <HI>all that.</HI></P>
<P>After the Re&s;toration Things began to return to their old Channel, and 30 Years more the Di&s;&s;enters endur'd another <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Servitude, were <HI>Per&s;ecu|ted, Plunder'd, Indicted, Impri&s;on'd, Plagu'd</HI> with Im|po&s;itions, Stigmatiz'd with a Thou&s;and Reproaches, their Meeting-Hou&s;es Demoli&s;h'd, their E&s;tates Con|fi&s;cated, their Per&s;ons Excommunicated, and Anathe|matiz'd, Sworn into <HI>Plots</HI> they never Heard of, and in|to Crimes they never Commltted, Dragg'd to Goals, Gibbets and Scaffolds, and the like; <HI>all this while Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedence, if there were any &s;uch thing,</HI> was found among them more than any where el&s;e; for here was no Rebellion, no In&s;urrection, nor breaking of the <HI>Peace</HI> by the Di&s;&s;enters, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e Op|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>After this comes King <HI>James</HI> the Second to the Crown, and he turn'd the Scale, and, together with Inva&s;ion of Liberty, falls upon the Church, begins to Rifle her of her Trophies, <HI>for no E&s;&s;entials had been touch'd,</HI> and how long did &s;he bear it? Not 80 Years, not 30 Years, no, not &s;o many Months.</P>
<P>What did &s;he do? Truly nothing but what &s;he ought to have done; Defend her Liberty and Religi|on by Force, again&s;t Unju&s;t Inva&s;ion and Tyranny: nothing but what all the Nations in the World have done, and wou'd do again if they cou'd.</P>
<P>The only Error we Charge upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was &s;etting up pretences of what they really wou'd not practice; crying up them&s;elves for Fools, when we knew they were Wi&s;er Men, calling them|&s;elves
<PB N="196" REF="193">
humble Slaves, but when the Trial came, pro|ving Stubborn, Refractory, <HI>Liberty Mongers,</HI> even as bad as the wor&s;t Whig or Phanatick of them all.</P>
<P>For the future then, if a Humble Mediator might be permitted to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hou'd be in the&s;e &s;hort and friendly Terms.</P>
<P>Pray Gentlemen never be Impo&s;ed upon, to pre|tend to more Loyalty, and more &s;lavi&s;h Principles than you intend to practice.</P>
<P>Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sove|reign requires. Our Late King, who I am not a&s;ham'd to &s;how as a Pattern for future Ages, requir'd; and Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, <HI>without Affront to Her Maje&s;ty's Authority it may be &s;aid,</HI> requires no further Obedi|ence from the People of <HI>England</HI> than the Laws of <HI>England</HI> require.</P>
<P>To Govern according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the People; and to obey according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the Soveraign. The Laws are the Te&s;t both of the Royal Authority, and of the Subjects Obedience; and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires, is abu&s;ing your Prince, and abu|&s;ing your Selves.</P>
<P>Never be a&s;hamed to own, with <HI>your Brethren the Whigs,</HI> that you are willing to Submit to Authority but that you expect to be govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm,</P>
<P>Let the Scoth Motto be &s;et upon your Liberties; and according to your con&s;tant Practice, <HI>as well as theirs;</HI> let all Men know you de&s;ign to make it Good, <HI>Nemo me Impune Lace&s;&s;it.</HI></P>
<P>And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of <HI>England, nor were a Hundredth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it;</HI> &s;o for the Fu|ture 'tis hoped you will not &s;uffer &s;uch to Mingle them&s;elves among you, or to Act in the Name of
<PB N="197" REF="194">
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who pretend to a Blind Ab|&s;olute Obedience to Princes.</P>
<P>And <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Gentlemen, a little more Mode&s;ty to your Humble Servants, your Prote&s;tant Brethren the Di&s;&s;enters, or Whigs, I mean as to Matter of Loyalty: For in Truth, Gentlemen, we do not &s;ee any Rea&s;on you have to Reproach us in that Matter, you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours.</P>

<PB N="198" REF="195">
Roo&s;t upon the Ground; the Hor&s;es jo&s;tling about for room and putting the Cock in danger of his Life, he gives them this grave Advice; <HI>Pray Gentlefolks let us &s;tand &s;till, for fear we &s;hould tread upon one another.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome People in the World, who now they are <HI>&V;npearcht,</HI> and reduc'd to an Equality with other People, and under &s;trong and very ju&s;t Appre|hen&s;ions of being further Treated as they de&s;erve, begin, with <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s-Cock, to Preach up Peace and U|nion, and the Chri&s;tian Duties of Moderation, forget|ting, that when they had the Power in their Hands, tho&s;e Graces were Strangers in their Gates.</P>
<P>It is now near Fourteen Years that the Glory and Peace of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Church in the World has been Eclips'd, Buffetted, and Di&s;turb'd, by a &s;ort of Men, who God in his Providence has &s;uffer'd to in&s;ult over her, and bring her down; the&s;e have been the Days of her Humiliation and Tribulation: She has born with an invincible Patience the Reproach of the Wicked, and God has at la&s;t heard her Prayers, and deliver'd her from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Stranger.</P>
<P>And now they find their Day is over, their Power gone, and the Throne of this Nation po&s;&s;e&s;t by a Roy|al, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> True, and ever Con&s;tant, Member of, and Friend to, the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Now they find that they are in danger of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s ju&s;t Re&s;entments; now they cry out <HI>Peace, &V;nion, Forbear|ance,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> as if the Church had not too long harbour'd her Enemies under her Wing, and nouri&s;h'd the Viperous Brood, till they hi&s;s and fly in the Face of the Mother that cheri&s;h'd them.</P>
<P><HI>No, Gentlemen,</HI> the Time of Mercy is pa&s;t, your <HI>Day of Grace is over;</HI> you &s;hou'd have practic'd Peace, and Moderation, and Charity, if you expected any your &s;elves.</P>
<P>We have heard none of this Le&s;&s;on for Fourteen Years pa&s;t: We have been huff'd and bully'd with

<P>You have <HI>Butcher'd</HI> one King <HI>Depos'd</HI> another King, and made a <HI>mock King</HI> of a Third; and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and tru&s;ted by the Fourth; any Body that did not know the Temper of your Party, wou'd &s;tand amaz'd at the Impudence, as well as Fully, to think of it.</P>
<P>Your Management of your <HI>Dutch Monarch,</HI> whom you reduc'd to a meer <HI>King of Cl&mdash;s,</HI> is enough to give any future Princes &s;uch an Idea of your Principles, as to warn them &s;ufficiently from coming into your Clutches; and God be thank'd, the Queen is out of your Hands, knows you, and will have a care of you.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the &s;upream Authority of a Nation has in its &s;elf a <HI>Power, and a Right to that Pow|er,</HI> to execute the Laws upon any part of that Nation it governs. The execution of the known Laws of the
<PB N="200" REF="197">
Land, and that with a weak and gentle Hand neither was all this phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Per&s;ecution; this they have magnified to a Height, that the Sufferings of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France</HI> were not to be compar'd with&mdash;Now to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon tho&s;e who tran&s;|gre&s;s them, after voluntarily con&s;enting to the mak|ing tho&s;e Laws, can never be call'd Per&s;ecution, but Ju&s;tice. But Ju&s;tice is always Violence to the Party offending, for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes. The fir&s;t execution of the Laws again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> was in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t; and what did it amount to, truly, the wor&s;t they &s;uf|fer'd, was at their own reque&s;t, to let them go to <HI>New-England,</HI> and erect a new Collony, and give them great Priviledges, Grants, and &s;uitable Powers, keep them under Protection, and defend them again&s;t all Invaders, and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them. This was the cruelty of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> fatal Lenity! 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. Had King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent all the Puri|tans in <HI>England</HI> away to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> we had been a national, unmix'd, Church; the Church of <HI>England</HI> had been kept undivided and entire.</P>
<P>To requite the Lenity of the Father, they take up Arms again&s;t the Son; Conquer, Pur&s;ue, Take, Im|pri&s;on, and at la&s;t put to Death, the Anointed of God, and De&s;troy the very Being and Nature of Govern|ment, &s;etting up a fordid Impo&s;tor, who had neither Title to Govern, nor Under&s;tanding to Manage, but &s;upplied that want with Power, bloody and de&s;perate Councils and Craft, without Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Had not King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t withheld the full ex|ecution of the Laws; had he given them &s;trict Ju&s;tice he had clear'd the Nation of them, and the Con&s;equen|ces had been plain; his <HI>Son had never been Murther'd by them,</HI> nor the Monarchy overwhelm'd; 'twas <HI>too</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="198">
<HI>much Mercy</HI> &s;hewn them was the ruin of his Po&s;terity, and the ruin of the Nations Peace. One would think the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Tolera|tion, when they know that they have once requited us with a civil War, and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Per&s;ecution for our former Civility.</P>
<P>Nay to encourage us to be ea&s;ie with them, 'tls ap|parent that they never had the Upper-hand of the Church, but they treated Her with all the Severity; with all the Reproach and Contempt as was po&s;&s;ible: What Peace, and what Mercy did they &s;hew the Loy|al Gentry of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Time of their Triumphant Commonwealth? How did they put all the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> to Ran&s;om, whether they were Actually in Arms for the King or not, ma|king People compound for their E&s;tates, and &s;tarve their Families? How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eque&s;ter'd the Mini&s;ters, de|vour'd the Patrimony of the Church, and divided the Spoil, by &s;haring the Church-Lands among their Sol|diers, and turning her Clergy out to &s;tarve? ju&s;t &s;uch Mea&s;ure as they have meted, &s;hou'd be mea&s;ur'd them again.</P>
<P>Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and 'tis plain She has put it in Practice towards the Di&s;&s;enters, even beyond what they ought, till She has been wanting to Her Self, and in effect, unkind to own Sons; particularly, in the too much Lenity of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, mention|ed before; had he &s;o Rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land, which he had an Opportunity early to ha' done, they had not had the Power to vex the Church, as &s;ince they have done.</P>
<P>IN the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, how did the Church reward their Bloody Doings with Lenity and Mercy, <HI>except the Barbarous Regicides of the preten|ded</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="199">
<HI>Court of Ju&s;tice:</HI> not a Soul &s;uffer'd for all the Blood in an Unnatural War: King <HI>Charles</HI> came in all Mercy and Love, cheri&s;h'd them, prefer'd them, employ'd them, withheld the Rigour of the Law, and oftentimes, even again&s;t the Advice of his Par|liament, gave them Liberty of Con&s;cience; and how did they requite him wich the villainous Contrivance to Depo&s;e and Murther him and his Succe&s;&s;or at the <HI>Rye-Plot.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>James,</HI> as if Mercy was the inherent Quality of the Family, began his Reign with unu&s;ual Favour to them: Nor could their joining with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> again&s;t him move him to do him&s;elf Ju|&s;tice upon them; but that mi&s;taken Prince thought to win them by Gentlene&s;s and Love, Poclaim'd an Uni|ver&s;al Liberty to them, and rather di&s;countenanc'd the Church of <HI>England</HI> than them; how they requited him all the World knows.</P>
<P>THE late Reign is too fre&s;h in the Memory of all the World to need a Comment; how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Grie|vances, they pu&s;ht Things to that Extremity, in Con|junction wirh &s;ome mi&s;taken Gentlemen, as to De|po&s;e the late King, as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not have been redre&s;s'd but by the ab&s;olute Ruin of the Prince: Here's an in&s;tance of their Temper, their Peace, and Charity. To what height they car|ried them&s;elves during the Reign of a King of their own; how they crope into all Places of Tru&s;t and Profit; how they In&s;inuated into the Favour of the King, and were at fir&s;t prefer'd to the highe&s;t Places in the Nation; how they engro&s;s'd the Mini&s;try, and <HI>above all, how pitifully they Manag'd,</HI> is too plain to need any Remarks.</P>
<P>BUT particularly their Mercy and Charity, the Spirit of Union, they tell us &s;o much of, has been re|markable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if any Man wou'd &s;ee the Spirit

<P>In a &s;mall Treati&s;e of the Sufferings of the Epi&s;co|pal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'twill appear what U&s;age they met with, how they not only lo&s;t their Living, but in &s;everal Places, were plunder'd and abus'd in their Per|&s;ons; the Mini&s;ters that cou'd not Conform, turn'd out with numerous Families, and no Maintenance, and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of Bread; and the Cruelties of the Parties are innu|merable, and not to be attempted in this &s;hort Piece.</P>
<P>And now to prevent the di&s;tant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from <HI>England;</HI> with a true <HI>Presbyterian Policy,</HI> they put in for <HI>a &V;nion of Nations,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> might unite their Church with the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Presbyterian Mem|bers &s;it in our Hou&s;e of Commons, and their A&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>Scotch</HI> canting Long Cloaks in our Convocati|on, what might have been if our Phanatick, Whiggi&s;h States-men continu'd, God only knows, but we hope we are out of fear of that now.</P>
<P>'Tis alled'd by &s;ome of the Faction, and they began to Bully us with it; that if we won't Unite with them, they will not &s;ettle the Crown with us again, but when Her Maje&s;ty Dies, will chu&s;e a King for them|&s;elves.</P>

<P>To this may be an&s;wer'd, 1. THEY are not &s;o Numerous as the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> and yet the <HI>French</HI> King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once, and we don't find he Mi&s;&s;es them at Home.</P>
<P>But I am not of the Opinion they are &s;o Numerous as is pretended, their Party is more Numerous than their Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e mi&s;taken People of the Church who are mi&s;led and deluded by their wheedling Ar|tifices, to join with them, make their Party the great|ter; but tho&s;e will open their Eyes, when the Govern|ment &s;hall &s;et heartily about the Work, and come off from them, as &s;ome Animals, which they &s;ay, always de&s;ert a Hou&s;e when 'tis likely to fall.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> The more Numerous, the more Dangerous and therefore the more Need to Suppre&s;s them; and God has &s;uffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our Sides, for not utterly extingui&s;hing them long ago.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> If we are to allow them, only becau&s;e we
<PB N="205" REF="202">
cannot Suppre&s;s them, then it ought to be try'd whe|ther we can or no; and I am of Opinion 'tis ea&s;ie to be done, and cou'd pre&s;cribe Ways and Means, if it were proper, but I doubt not the Government will find effectual Methods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument they u&s;e, which is this, That 'tis a Time of War, and we have need to Unite again&s;t the common Enemy.</P>
<P>WE an&s;wer, This common Enemy had been no E|nemy, if they had not made him &s;o; he was quiet, in peace, and no way di&s;turb'd, or encroach'd upon us, and we know no rea&s;on we had to quarrel with him.</P>
<P>But further, We make no que&s;tion but we are able to deal with this common Enemy without their help; but why mu&s;t we unite with them, becau&s;e of the E|nemy? Will they go over to the Enemy, if we do not prevent it by a Union with them?&mdash;We are ve|ry well contented they &s;hou'd, and make no que&s;tion we &s;hall be ready to deal with them and the common Enemy too, and better without them than with them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if we have a common Enemy, there is the more need to be &s;ecure again&s;t our private Enemies; if there is one common Enemy, we have the le&s;s need to have an Enemy in our Bowels.</P>
<P>'Twas a great Argument &s;ome People u&s;ed again&s;t Suppre&s;&s;ing the Old Money, that 'twas a Time of War, and 'twas too great a Ri&s;que for the Nation to run, if we &s;hou'd not ma&s;ter it, we &s;hou'd be undone: and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not &s;o great, but it might be ma&s;ter'd, and the Succe&s;s was an&s;wer|able. The Suppre&s;&s;ing the Di&s;&s;enters is not a harder Work, nor a Work of le&s;s Nece&s;&s;ity to the Publick: we can never enjoy a &s;ettled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whig|gi&s;me, Faction, and Schi&s;m is melted down like the Old-Money.</P>

To talk of the Difficulty, is to Frighten our &s;elves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Powerful Party, which are indeed a Party without Power; Difficulties often appear greater at a di&s;tance, than when they are &s;earch'd into with Judgment, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them.</P>
<P>We are not to be frightned with it; this Age is wi&s;er than that, by all our own Experience, <HI>and theirs too;</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, had early &s;uppre&s;t this Party, if he had took more deliberate Mea&s;ures.

<P>Here are &s;ome popular Objections in the way.</P>
<P>As <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Queen has promis'd them, to continue them in their Tolerated Liberty; and has told us She will be a Religious Ob&s;erver of Her Word.</P>
<P>WHAT Her Maje&s;ty will do we cannot help, but what, as the Head of the Church, She ought to do, is another Ca&s;e: Her Maje&s;ty has promi&s;ed to Protect and Defend the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and if She cannot effectually do that without the De&s;truction of the Di&s;&s;enters, She mu&s;t of cour&s;e di&s;pence with one Pro|mi&s;e to comply with another. But to an&s;wer <HI>this Cavil more effectually:</HI> Her Maje&s;ty did never promi&s;e to Maintain the Toleration, to the De&s;truction of the Church; but it is upon &s;uppo&s;ition that it may be com|patible
<PB N="207" REF="204">
with the well being and &s;afety of the Church ch which She had declar'd She would take e&s;pecial Care of: Now if the&s;e two Intere&s;ts cla&s;h, 'tis plain Her Maje&s;ties Intentions are to Upholds, Protect, De|fend, and E&s;tabli&s;h the Church, and this we conceive is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Di&s;&s;enters, and therefore 'tis time enough: But this is a weak An&s;wer.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, IF a Danger be real, the Di&s;tance of it is no Argument again&s;t, but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention, le&s;t it be too late hereafter.</P>
<P>And 2dly, Here is the Opportunity, and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to &s;ecure her &s;elf, and de&s;troy her Enemies.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity, the Time is come which all good Men ha' wi&s;h'd for, that the Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> may &s;erve the Church of <HI>England;</HI> now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of <HI>England</HI> Queen.</P>
<P><HI>What will ye do for your Si&s;ter in the Day that She &s;hall be &s;poken for?</HI></P>
<P>If ever you will e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t Chri&s;tian Church in the World.</P>

<P>If ever you will free the Nation from the viperous Brood that have &s;o long &s;uck'd the Blood of their Mother.</P>
<P>If ever you will leave your Po&s;terity free from Faction and Rebellion, this is the time.</P>

<P>How many Millions of future Souls we &s;ave from Infection and Delu&s;ion, if the pre&s;ent Race of poi&s;on'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land.</P>

to be cho&s;en Sheriffs and Mayors, would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd.</P>
<P>If one &s;evere Law were made, and punctually ex|ecuted, that who ever was found at a Conventicle, &s;hou'd be Bani&s;h'd the Nation, and the Preacher be Hang'd, we &s;hou'd &s;oon &s;ee an end of the Tale, they wou'd all come to Church; and one Age wou'd make us all One again.</P>
<P>TO talk of 5<HI>s.</HI> a Month for not coming to the Sa|crament, and 1<HI>s. per</HI> Week for not coming to Church this is &s;uch a way of converting People as never was known, this is &s;elling them a Liberty to tran&s;gre&s;s for &s;o much Money: If it be not a Crime, why don't we give them full Licence? And if it be, no Price ought to compound for the committing it, for that is &s;elling a Liberty to People to &s;in again&s;t God and the Government.</P>
<P>If it be a Crime of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence both a|gain&s;t the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, the Glo|ry of God, the Good of the Church, and the Happi|ne&s;s of the Soul, let us rank it among capital Offences, and let it receive a Puni&s;hment in proportion to it.</P>
<P>We Hang Men for Trifles, and Bani&s;h them for things not worth naming, but an Offence again&s;t God and the Church, again&s;t the Welfare of the World, and the Dignity of Religion, &s;hall be bought off for 5<HI>s.</HI> this is &s;uch a &s;hame to a Chri&s;tian Government, that 'tis with regret I tran&s;mit it to Po&s;terity.</P>

<P>And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will &s;oon be taken off from this Law too. I am not &s;uppo&s;ing that all the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> &s;hou'd be Hang'd or Bani&s;h'd, but as in ca&s;es of Rebellions and In&s;urrecti|ons,

<P>To make the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this matter out of que&s;tion, and more unan&s;werably plain, let us exa|mine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions, and let us &s;ee how they can ju&s;ti|fie a Separation, or we of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can ju&s;tifie our bearing the In&s;ults and Inconveniencies of the Party.</P>
<P>ONE of their leading Pa&s;tors, and a Man of as much Learning as mo&s;t among them in his An|&s;wer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>An Enquiry into the Oc|ca&s;ional Conformity,</HI> hath the&s;e Words, P. 27. <HI>Do the Religion of the Church and the Meeting-bou&s;es make two Religions? Wherein do they differ? The Sub&s;tance of the &s;ame Religion is common to them both; and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ</HI> P. 28. <HI>Thirty nine Articles are given us for the &s;ummary of our Religion, Thirty &s;ix contain the Sub&s;tance of it, wherein we agree; Three the additional Appendices, about which we have &s;ome differences.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if as by their own acknowledgment, the Church of <HI>England</HI> is a true Church, and the Diffe|rence between them is only in a few Modes and Acci|dents, why &s;hould we expect that they will &s;uffer Gal|lies, corporeal Puni&s;hment and Bani&s;hment for the&s;e Trifles; There is no que&s;tion but they will be wi&s;er, even their own Principles won't bear them out in it, they will certainly comply with the Laws, and with Rea&s;on, and tho' at the fir&s;t, Severity may &s;eem hard, the next Age will feel nothing of it, the Contagion will be rooted out, the Di&s;ea&s;e being cur'd, there will be no need of the Operation, but if they &s;hould ven|ture to tran&s;gre&s;s, and fall into the Pit, all the World mu&s;t condemn their Ob&s;tinacy, as being without ground from their own Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="209">
Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off, and the Party actually &s;uppre&s;t, and the Di&s;quiets they have &s;o often brought upon the Nation, prevented.</P>
<P>THEIR Numbers, and their Wealth, makes them Haughty, and that 'tis &s;o far from being an Argument to per&s;wade us to forbear them, that 'tis a Warning to us, without any more delay, to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church, or remove them from us.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent, Heaven be prais'd, they are not &s;o Formidable as they have been, and 'tis our own fault if ever we &s;uffer them to be &s;o; Providence, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eems to join in this particular, that now the De&s;troyers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd, and to this end the pre&s;ent Opportu|nity &s;eems to be put into our Hands.</P>
<P>To this end Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty &s;eems re&s;erv'd to enjoy the Crown, that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be re&s;tor'd by her Hand.</P>
<P>To this end the Face of Affairs have receiv'd &s;uch a Turn in the proce&s;s of a few Months, as never has been before; the leading Men of the Nation, the u|niver&s;al cry of the People, the unanimous Reque&s;t of the Clergy, agree in this, that the Deliverance of our Church is at Hand.</P>
<P>For this end has Providence given us &s;uch a Parlia|ment, &s;uch a Convocation, &s;uch a Gentry, and &s;uch a Queen as we never had before.</P>

<P>Any Gentlemen who have Patience to peru&s;e the Author of the <HI>New A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> will find Gallows, Galleys, Per&s;ecution and De&s;truction of the Di&s;&s;enters are directly pointed at, as fairly intended, and de|&s;ign'd as in this &s;horte&s;t way, as, <HI>had it been real,</HI> can be pretended; there is as much Virulence again&s;t a Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> again&s;t King <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Government, and again&s;t the Line of <HI>Hannover</HI> there is as much Noi&s;e and Pains taken in Mr. <HI>S&mdash;s</HI> Sermon to blacken the Di&s;&s;enters, and thereby to qualifie them for the Abhorrence of all Mankind, as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="214">
The meaning then of this Paper is in &s;hort to tell the&s;e Gentlemen,</P>
<P N="1">1. That 'tis Non&s;ence to go round about, and tell us of the Crimes of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> to prepare the World to believe they are not fit to Live in a Humane Society, that they are Enemies to the Government, and Law, to the QUEEN, and the Publick Peace, and the like; <HI>the &s;horte&s;t way,</HI> and the &s;oone&s;t, wou'd be to tell us plainly that they wou'd have them all hang'd, Bani&s;h'd and De&s;troyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. But withal to acquaint tho&s;e Gentlemen who fancy the time is come to bring it to pa&s;s, that they are mi&s;taken, for that when the thing they mean, is put into plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the whole Nation replies with the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Captain, <HI>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he &s;hou'd do the&s;e things?</HI> The Gentlemen are mi&s;taken in every partlcular, it will not go down, the QUEEN, the Council, the Parliament are all Offended, to have it &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;uch a thing was po&s;&s;ible to come into their Minds; and not a Man, but a Learn|ed <HI>Mercer,</HI> not far from the Corner of <HI>Fanchurch-&s;treet,</HI> has been found to approve it.</P>
<P>Thus a poor Author has ventur'd to have all Man|kind call him Villain and Traytor to his Country and Friends, for making other Peoples thoughts &s;peak in his Words.</P>
<P>From this Declaration of his real de&s;ign, he humbly hopes the Lords of Her Maje&s;ties Council, or the Hou&s;e of Parliament, will be no longer offended, and that the poor People in trouble on this Account &s;hall be Pardoned or Excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>He al&s;o de&s;ires that all men who have taken Offence at the Book, mi&s;taking the Authors de&s;ign; will &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to think again, and withhold their Cen&s;ure till they find them&s;elves qualified to make a Venture like this for the good of their Native Coun|trey.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="215">
As to Expre&s;&s;ions which &s;eem to reflect upon Per|&s;ons or Nations; he declares them to be only <HI>the Cant of the Nonjuring Party Expos'd,</HI> and thinks it very ne|ce&s;&s;ary to let the World know that 'tis their u&s;ual Language with which they Treat the <HI>Late KING,</HI> the <HI>Scotch &V;nion,</HI> and the <HI>Line of Hannover.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis hard, after all, that this &s;hould not be percei|ved by all the Town, that not one man can &s;ee it, ei|ther Churchman or Di&s;&s;enter.</P>
<P>That not the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves can &s;ee that this was the only way to &s;atisfy them, that whatever the Parliament might think fit to do to re&s;train Occa&s;ion|al Communion, Per&s;ecution and De&s;truction was ne|ver in their intention, and that therefore they ha' no|thing to do but to be quiet and ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>For any thing in the manner of the Paper which may offend either the Government, Parliament, or private Per&s;ons, the Author humbly begs their Par|don, and <HI>prote&s;ting the Hone&s;ty of his intention,</HI> re&s;olves, if the poor People now in Trouble may be excu&s;ed, to throw him&s;elf upon the Favour of the Government rather than others &s;hall be ruin'd for his mi&s;takes.</P>

that tho the <HI>Church Men</HI> are Affronted, becau&s;e 'twas Written again&s;t them, and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are Affron|ted, becau&s;e 'tis Wrote again&s;t them too, I don't well under&s;tand it, one &s;ort mu&s;t be Fools, that's certain.</P>

<P>I don't care whether I under&s;tand it or no, he is a <HI>Rogue,</HI> a <HI>Villain,</HI> and I wi&s;h the Government had him, if I knew where he was, I'd deliver him up, and <HI>abate them the</HI> 501.</P>

<P>You are &s;o &s;harp upon me, I do under&s;tand a little too, I under&s;tand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with, and he is a Man they &s;ay who has been the occa&s;ion of all this Per&s;ecution which is com|ing upon us, by railing at <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HI></P>

<P>If he expos'd you for <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> 'tis what you ought to have Rectify'd your &s;elves, that you need not have been expos'd for it; and in that he was your Friend, for had you took the hint, and exploded the Practice, there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it.</P>

<P>Ay that is true, I am for Liberty for every man to &s;erve God as is mo&s;t agreeable to his Con&s;ci|ence: But this is not &s;erving God at all: be&s;ides Sir, I could ea&s;ily make it appear, this Act is for your Ad|vantage, if you were a &s;ort of People to be convinc'd.</P>

<P>Pray, how Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, it will purge you of all your half in half Profe&s;&s;ors. That's one thing; then it will put all tho&s;e Gentlemen into a capacity of being in pla|ces and Parliaments, who tho' by this Act they are &s;e|parated from you, and rejoin'd to the Church becau&s;e they can conform, will &s;till be friends to your Intere&s;t in all Publick Concerns; and therefore had I been to word the Bill &s;o as to have done mo&s;t harm, it &s;hou'd have excluded all that ever were Di&s;&s;enters, and have forc'd you to continue &s;o, and not have ac|cepted your return to the Church without a public Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you may per&s;wade us 'tis for our advantage, but we don't like it, and therefore we hate him for medling with it; for what had he to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>About as much as you and I have to do with him, if a man meddles with what does not concern him, that's his Fault, and if we who really have no|thing to do with him, meddle with him, that is our Fault, let the Government alone with him, have you nothing el&s;e to talk no?</P>

<P>Why all the Town has talkt of him as well as we.</P>

<P>If you had &s;aid he had broke and won't pay his Debts, you had &s;aid more to the purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Ay, but I'll rail at him for all that.</P>

<P>That's a further Te&s;timony of your being a Di&s;&s;enter; why if you will have it, take it, I &s;ay, <HI>God Almighty would have &s;eem'd unkind to you, if he had not given you a great deal of Grace? For he has given you but little Wit.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>French,</HI> who are Ma&s;ters of Addre&s;s, u&s;ed all the Skill and Cunning with the Roman Catholick <HI>Princes,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Italy,</HI> to have made it pa&s;s for a <HI>War of Religion,</HI> thinking by that finene&s;s to have drawn them off from the Confederacy. But <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. who, 'twas likely, knew as much of Religi|on, and the Intere&s;t of the Church, as the State&s;|men of <HI>France,</HI> &s;aw through that Artifice, and readily agreed with the Emperour, and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> That the Growing Greatne&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> and the Mea|&s;ures laid for the Subjecting <HI>Europe</HI> to her Govern|ment were really more dangerous things, and of more immediate Con&s;equence to the Publick Liberty, than the Matter of Religion could be: And therefore, tho' the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> made &s;ome &s;eeming Difficulties at fir&s;t; yet the <HI>French</HI> having thrown off the Mask, and fallen upon his Catholick Confederate the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the mo&s;t Bigotted Romani&s;t made no &s;cruple to entertain the Heretick Soldiers, to recall the ban|i&s;h'd <HI>Vaudois,</HI> to fight under the Command of <HI>Prote|&s;tant</HI> Generals, to accept of the Sub&s;idial Supplies of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Money, and the protection of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Armies; thereby evidently declaring to the World, that this was a War of State, not of Religion; and that the real Intere&s;t of <HI>Princes,</HI> is to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves, and their Subjects, again&s;t a too powerful <HI>In|vader,</HI> by Leagues and A&s;&s;i&s;tances, let their Religious Intere&s;ts be what they will.</P>

<P>So that it has been apparent beyond the power of Contradiction, that this has been a War of State, not a War of Religion: Nor can I imagine, generally &s;peak|ing, that it can ever be the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> take them together, to Commence a War of Religion: For tho' 'tis true, That the <HI>Pope</HI> always Exalted both his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Credit,</HI> in the blind Ages of bigotted Devotion, by his Cru&s;adoes and Holy Ex|peditions; yet &s;ince, the World has more Years over its Head, and the Cheat has been di&s;covered, <HI>Int're&s;t</HI> has prevail'd too much upon Devotion to be deceiv'd any more at that rate: And the Reformed Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> are too potent to be us'd &s;o any more.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion has lo&s;t Ground in <HI>France;</HI> and that Kingdom where once the <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> were Strong enough to Contend with their Go|vernours for their Liberty, is now wholly <HI>Roman,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;eems to be &s;o.

<P><PB N="245" REF="242"><HI>On the Roman Catholick Side,</HI></P>
<P>There would be the Emperor, the Pope, the King of <HI>France,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> Five Electoral Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Catholick Cantons of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland.</HI></P>

<P>The King of <HI>England,</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Czar of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> States of <HI>Holland,</HI> Three Electoral Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> but tho&s;e by far the Stronge&s;t; the Prote&s;tant Cantons of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> the <HI>Gri&s;ons, Hungarians, Tran&s;ilvanians,</HI> and <HI>Moldaviaens.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I think it wou'd ea&s;ily be granted, That the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, Dane,</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI> United; wou'd be able to Maintain &s;o ab&s;olute a Dominion of the Seas, as would entirely Ruin the Negotiation of the Catholick Party, Beggar their Merchants, Starve their I&s;lands, and De&s;troy all their Trade: They &s;hould never be able to Build a Ship without Leave; their Ports &s;hould be Bombarded and De&s;troy'd, their Open Country be Ruin'd by De&s;cents, and all their Coa&s;ts continually Harra&s;s'd and Alarm'd by Fleets, and Volant Parties.</P>
<P>What the Armies at Land could do, I referr to the Hi&s;tory of the Pre&s;ent War, and of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> who, barely on a War of Religion, and with only his Own &s;ingle Force, and the Prote|&s;tant Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> who were then much Wea|ker than they are now, in Two Years and a half pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> and &s;hook the Imperial Crown on the Head of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>It would take up too much room in this &s;hort Trea|ti&s;e, to Con&s;ider the Proportion of the Force of the&s;e

<P>As to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he wou'd as he has in all Ca&s;es have Work enough to <HI>Secure his Own;</HI> the Empires &s;e|parated from the Prote&s;tant Party, with the <HI>Swede, Dane, Brandenburghers, Saxons,</HI> and all the Prince of the <HI>Augu&s;tane</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion on its Front, with the Pro|te&s;tants of <HI>&V;pper Hungaria</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> in the Rear, with the <HI>Switz</HI> and <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> in the Flank, wou'd be very hard be&s;tead, having no Power but the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and the &s;mall Electorates of <HI>Ments, Triers</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> which are of no Con&s;ideration to uphold it. Some Support might be drawn from <HI>Italy</HI> indeed; but the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t give a powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or the Emperor would be Devoured in two Campaigns, the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;tern Germans,</HI> as the <HI>Lunenburghers</HI> of <HI>Hannover</HI> and <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> would be the Oppo&s;ites to the <HI>French</HI> on this &s;ide, and there the Contention would be &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>I believe no Wi&s;e Man wi&s;hes for &s;o Univer&s;al a Di&s;traction as &s;uch a War would make in <HI>Europe,</HI> but 'tis needful to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Thing, in order to Exa|mine whether we ought to apprehend any Danger from it, in ca&s;e &s;uch an Attempt &s;hou'd ever be made in <HI>Europe;</HI> for 'tis apparent, &s;ome Princes of the Ro|man Catholick Party, have Will enough to &s;uch an Enterprize, and the Pope would be forward enough to &s;et it on Foot, if he were but &s;ure of the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The glorious Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> in which all the World mu&s;t acknowledge the <HI>French</HI> have been very much reduc'd, has but One Clau&s;e that any way Eclip|&s;es the Honour of its Conclu&s;ion on the Prote&s;tant &s;ide, and that is, that it left the Poor Prote&s;tant Sub|jects of the King of <HI>France,</HI> without any &s;helter from the Violences of their Per&s;ecutors; as if the
<PB N="247" REF="244">
Prote&s;tant Princes had &s;o much excluded the Int're&s;ts of Religion from the Articles, that they had not one Compa&s;&s;ionate Thought for their Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;ecu|ted Brethren. 'Tis true, the War was wholly <HI>a War of State,</HI> as is before noted, and the Inva&s;ion of Pro|perty was the Occa&s;ion of it; and therefore the Sur|render of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who is a Roman Catholick, nay, a few Villages in the <HI>Chattelany</HI> of <HI>Aeth,</HI> made more Bu&s;tle in the Treaty, than the Re&s;toration of Three Hundred Thou&s;and bani&s;h'd Chri&s;tians to their Country and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Some have pre&s;um'd to &s;ay, That had the Re&s;tora|tion of the Edict of <HI>Nants</HI> been in&s;i&s;ted on with the &s;ame Vigour as the Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> it wou'd as ea&s;i|ly have been obtain'd; and the&s;e People, among whom &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> Refugees are of that Mind, think the Prote&s;tant Int're&s;t was not &s;o much Con&s;idered in that Treaty as it ought to have been. I cou'd ea&s;ily An&s;wer &s;uch Objectors, by telling them, That the Ground of this War being only Matter of Right, to reduce the Power of <HI>France</HI> to a Balance, and to oblige her to re&s;tore what &s;he had by Force and Inju&s;tice ta|ken from her Neighbours; this being obtain'd, the End was an&s;wer'd, and the Confederate Princes had no farther Pretence for a War: As to the Prote&s;tant Refugees, they were the Subjects of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;trictly &s;peaking with re&s;pect of Princes, no body had any thing to do with it, let him u&s;e them how he would.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to have made it an Article of the Peace, it could not be expected that the Catholick Branches of the Confederacy would have in&s;i&s;ted on it, or, indeed, have de&s;ired it, and the Treaty being Manag'd in one Body, by the Re&s;olutions and Mea&s;ures of &s;everal Princes and States in Congre&s;s, the Catholick Princes would have immediately prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and the Union mu&s;t have been Di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="245">
So that there was no room to E&s;pou&s;e the Intere&s;ts of the Prote&s;tant Subjects of <HI>France</HI> in the General Treaty, any other Way than by Interce&s;&s;ion with their King to u&s;e them Mercifully: And this has been done by all Parties, tho' hitherto without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine what Methods are fur|ther to be u&s;ed, in order to oblige the King of <HI>France</HI> to u&s;e his Prote&s;tant Subjects with more Humanity, and if po&s;&s;ible, either to pre&s;erve them that Peace and Enjoyment of their Properties and E&s;tates, which is their Natural Right; or to procure them &s;ome other Equivalent which may give them &s;ome kind of Satis|faction and Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>To Commence a War again&s;t the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the Pro&s;ecution of His Prote&s;tant Subjects, &s;eems to be very Unju&s;t; becau&s;e Speaking of Right and Wrong, we are not Intere&s;ted in the Quarrel. I make no Que&s;tion but the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI> them&s;elves have, by the Laws of Nature and Rea&s;on, a right to Defend their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Inheritances, and to Maintain them&s;elves in them by Force, if they had a Power; and by the &s;ame Rule might by Strength of Hand recover and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own Rights, be they never &s;o Ju&s;t. Only thus far 'tis plain, That by the particular Article of the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> re|&s;pecting the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France; England</HI> is fore-clo&s;ed from &s;uch an Attempt, both Sides having expre&s;ly Stipulated not to A&s;&s;i&s;t the Subjects of either again&s;t their Soveraign.

<P><HI>And &s;ince the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King was never more de&s;i|rous of any thing, than that the Peace be Firm and Inviola|ble, the &s;aid King Promi&s;es and Agrees for Him&s;elf and His Succe&s;&s;ors, That he will on no Account what&s;oever di|&s;turb the &s;aid King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>in the free Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdoms, Countries, Lands or Dominions which He now Enjoys, and therefore Engages His Honour, upon</HI>

<P>There &s;eems to be but one way left, either to make any amends to the&s;e poor de&s;olate People, or to bring to pa&s;s their Re-admi&s;&s;ion; I do not &s;ay, that the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> will find it their Intere&s;t to put it in practice any more than I believe it is really the In|t're&s;t of the King of <HI>France,</HI> to Ruine &s;o many Thou|&s;and Families of his Peaceable Subjects; I mean, <HI>the Old Standard Law of Retaliation.</HI> But if it might be a Means to re-e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e poor People in Peace and Liberty, the Sacrificing Ten Thou&s;and Families of o|ther Per&s;ons, as Innocent as them, &s;eems to be a Ju&s;tice their pre&s;ent Ca&s;e calls for.</P>
<P><HI>Lex Talionis</HI> &s;eems to me to be the Foundation-Law of Right and Wrong; the Scripture is full of In&s;tan|ces of this Nature: <HI>Adoni-bezek, Agag,</HI> declare it to be agreeable to the Divine Method of Executive Ju&s;tice; the rea&s;on of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, &s;eems to be wholly mea&s;ured by it; and if exactly admini&s;tred, it carries &s;o convictive a Force, that no Per&s;on who ever fell under the &s;evere&s;t part of it, could object again&s;t
<PB N="250" REF="247">
the Execution of it. <HI>Adoni-bezek,</HI> above-mentioned, made a Confe&s;&s;ion of the Ju&s;tice of his Puni&s;hment, when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off, as a Retaliation of his Barbarities. <HI>Judg.</HI> 1. 7.

<P>'Tis true, this Retaliation is &s;trictly Per&s;onal; and all Retaliation ought to be &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible: But in &s;ome Ca&s;es it differs; and where a Per&s;onal Retaliation is not practicable, then People are con&s;idered in Colle|ctive Bodies, Nations, Families, and States. Thus, in a War, the Subjects of either Party account is very ju|&s;tifiable, to make them&s;elves &s;atisfaction for Injuries received, on any of the Subjects of the contrary Party, tho' the Wrong particularly &s;uffered, is not chargeable on tho&s;e particular Per&s;ons who &s;uffer for it.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rule, it &s;eems ju&s;tifiable, if we ca&s;t the whole Body of <HI>Europe</HI> into Two &s;orts, <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pro|te&s;tant,</HI> that while the one part commit Ho&s;tilities and Depredations on the other, the injur'd Party &s;hould have a Right of Retaliation on any Member of the &s;ame Body, of what Nation or Government &s;oever they &s;hall be, where the Power is properly put into their Hands: for Power, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, may pa&s;s for a &s;ufficient Right of Directing the &s;aid puni&s;hment, &s;ince nothing but want of <HI>Power</HI> interrupts its being <HI>Per|&s;onal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King has given a Challenge to all the <HI>Prote&s;tant Princes</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> in his pre&s;ent U&s;age of the Reformed Churches of <HI>France:</HI> He has carry'd on, tho' not with much Succe&s;s, a War for above Eight Years, again&s;t the whole United power of <HI>Europe;</HI> at la&s;t he has made a <HI>Peace,</HI> not at all to his Advantage, nor much for his Honour: And now the War of State is at an end, he &s;eems to be beginning a War of Religi|on,
<PB N="251" REF="248">
and that he may lay the Foundation of it &s;afely, he has began it upon his own Subjects.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine why all the <HI>Prote&s;tant Princes</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould not think them&s;elves concern'd in this Inva&s;ion of their Religion, &s;ince nothing is more cer|tain than that they are all &s;trook at, tho' more remote+ly: And by all the Rules of Human Policy, prevention ought to extend as far as the Evil is de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>If the weakening the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> in general, were only the De&s;ign; the &s;trengthening that Intere&s;t ought to be the care of the other: Be&s;ides, the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> are the Aggre&s;&s;ors, as they always have been, and the Inju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e &s;o great, that they have hardly ever attempted to make any other pretences for all their Barbarities, than the Ab&s;olute <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of their <HI>Omnipotent Monarch,</HI> who <HI>will have but one Reli|gion within his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, to me it &s;eems very proper, for the Ea&s;e of all <HI>Parties,</HI> That Religion &s;hould really divide the whole Body of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that all the Roman Catho|licks, and all the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> if they could but agree it among them&s;elves, &s;hould live by them&s;elves: That if the <HI>French</HI> King will have no <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in his Domi|nion, the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer no Roman Catholicks in theirs; and when all <HI>Parties</HI> are withdrawn to their own &s;ort, and the Divi&s;ion compleated, let the Ro|man Catholicks begin a War of Religion as &s;oon as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, in my Opinion, the unju&s;te&s;t thing in the World, that &s;ince the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> &s;uffer no <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to live among&s;t them, but the Bloody <HI>In|qui&s;ition</HI> de&s;troys them, and the <HI>French</HI> have Dragoon'd Three Hundred Thou&s;and of their <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and hurry'd Three Hundred Thou&s;and more out of their Country, to &s;eek Comfort from the Cha|rity of Neighbour States. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has Exil'd all his <HI>Prote&s;tant Vaudois:</HI> And hardly any <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="249">
Country admit the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> among them, &s;ome few parts of <HI>Germany</HI> excepted, yet the Prote&s;tant-Governments, at the &s;ame time, &s;uffer Three Milli|ons of Papi&s;ts to live among them, and enjoy their Li|berties and E&s;tates unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France, Savoy,</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> have been per&s;ecuted, under the A&s;&s;urances of the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaties, the mo&s;t &s;acred Edicts, and the firme&s;t Peace that could be made; they have never (their Enemies them&s;elves being Judges) been guilty of the Breach of their Faith or Loyalty. <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI> acknowledged it, when he had recour&s;e to them for Protection again&s;t his own mutinous Ca|tholick Subjects. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> acknowledged it, in his Speech to tho&s;e <HI>Vaudois</HI> whom he had Relea|&s;ed out of the Citadel of <HI>Turin.</HI> We never read of any War begun by the Prote&s;tants, they were always Defendants: We have not one In&s;tance of a Ma&s;&s;acre committed, or a King A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, or of Nobles Un|dermined, in order to be blown up by them; they have always been Men of Peace, till Self-Defence has oblig'd them to be Men of War. On the contrary, the Roman-Catholicks have been always unea&s;ie to the Governments they have lived under. Our Hi&s;tories are full of their Trea&s;ons. <HI>Ireland</HI> has twice been Delu|ged in Blood by their Rebellions and Cruelties. Two Kings of <HI>France</HI> have been Murthered by their A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nations, and innumerable Prote&s;tants Ma&s;&s;acred and Butcher'd in cold Blood, under the pretences of Friend|&s;hip, and a&s;&s;urance of a Treaty.</P>
<P>The Reigns of all our Kings and Queens in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. have been &s;trangely di&s;turb'd by the Plots, the Trea&s;ons and Rebellions of the Pa|pi&s;ts; they have often forfeited their E&s;tates and Li|berties to the Publick Ju&s;tice of the Nation, had they been dealt with by the Rules of &s;trict Retaliation.
<PB N="253" REF="250">
<HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> have &s;uch Rea&s;ons for Entire removing them out of their Dominions, as no Nation in the World can have greater; and yet here they live in Peace, under the protection of tho&s;e ve|ry Princes they refu&s;e to &s;wear Allegiance to, and un|der the &s;helter of tho&s;e Laws they refu&s;e to be bound by.

<P>On the contrary, the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France,</HI> tho charg'd with no Di&s;loyalty, nor guilty of no Crimes are Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their E&s;tates, Bani&s;h'd their Native Country, Dragoon'd, Shipt to the Gallies, and many of them Hang'd, their Children torn from them by Violence, and buried alive in Mona&s;teries and Nun|neries, and all the Cruelties an unbridled Soldiery can inflict, acted upon them, without any manner of Crime alledg'd but their Religion, and this when that very Religion was &s;ecur'd to them by the &s;olemne&s;t Leagues and Treaties in the World, Declared in the famous Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> Entred, Receiv'd and Regi&s;tred in all the Parliaments of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> in per&s;ecuting his <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects, acts not only the part of a Tyrant over them, as they are his Subjects, but is guilty of the Breach of the Faith and Honour of a King, oppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e <HI>Peo|ple</HI> who had their Religion tolerated and allow'd to them by his Ance&s;tors, in the mo&s;t &s;acred manner po&s;&s;ible; and he is al&s;o guilty of the greate&s;t Unkind|ne&s;s to tho&s;e very <HI>People</HI> who were the In&s;truments and Agents of the Glory of his Family, and of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>To make good which Reflection, that I may not &s;eem to be guilty of Di&s;re&s;pect to the Maje&s;ty of the King of <HI>France,</HI> 'tis needful to examine a little the
<PB N="254" REF="251">
Ground on which the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>France</HI> &s;tood for the la&s;t Century of Years, and the Hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent Royal Family of <HI>France,</HI> and how they came to the Crown.</P>
<P>In the Year 1571. on the 24th. Day of <HI>Augu&s;t, Charles</HI> IX. being King of <HI>France,</HI> the Third War with the <HI>Hugonots</HI> having been lately ended, and a Peace made with the Prote&s;tants, the Cities of <HI>Rochel, Montauban, Coignac,</HI> and <HI>la Charitie,</HI> being put into their Hands for Security, and the Chief of the Prote&s;tants wholly re&s;ting on the Faith and Honour of the King, in full Satisfaction of his &s;incere Intenti|ons, being come to Court, was acted the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Paris;</HI> at which, in the &s;pace of Five Days, above Thirty Thou&s;and Prote&s;tants were barbarou&s;ly Sur|prized and Butcher'd in Cold Blood.</P>
<P>Upon which follow'd the Fourth and Fifth Civil War; during which, King <HI>Charles</HI> IX. died; and the Crown fell to <HI>Henry</HI> III. the la&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois,</HI> and then newly Elected King of <HI>Poland.</HI> The Beginning of his Reign being entangled with Civil Broils, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t grew very &s;trong; and tho' the League forced the King to make Three &s;e|veral Wars with them, yet they &s;till maintain'd their Liberty and Religion.</P>
<P>At length the Faction of the <HI>Gui&s;es,</HI> known by the Name of the <HI>Catholick League,</HI> Declar'd them&s;elves &s;o ab&s;olutely again&s;t the King, and grew &s;o powerful, e&s;|pecially after the Death of the Duke and Cardinal of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> whom the King had cau&s;ed to be kill'd, that they had almo&s;t driven him out of the Kingdom. In this Exigence, the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> again&s;t whom they had carry'd on Four Per&s;ecutions and Wars, and therein de&s;troyed many thou&s;ands of their Brethren, under|took his Defence, and joining all their Forces, in or|der to Re&s;tore him, marched with him to the very Gates of <HI>Paris;</HI> where, while he was preparing for a
<PB N="255" REF="252">
general Attack of the City, he was barbarou&s;ly A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated by <HI>Jacques Clement,</HI> a <HI>Jacobin</HI> Monk, &s;ent out of the City on purpo&s;e, being &s;tabb'd in the Belly with a Poynard, of which he died the Day after.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> IV. the pre&s;ent King's Grand-father, was then King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and a <HI>Prote&s;tant;</HI> and being Lawful Heir to the Crown, as al&s;o recommended to the Nobility by the decea&s;ed King, at his death, took upon him the Stile and Title of <HI>King of France.</HI> The <HI>League,</HI> back'd by the Power of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> op|pos'd him with all the vigour imaginable; and many of the Catholick Nobility de&s;erted him, on the Ac|count of his being an Heretick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;erv'd him with all the Glory and Loyalty that ever was &s;hown, perhaps, in any War in the World; and, as is computed, during the Years War he maintain'd again&s;t the <HI>League,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Power, above an Hundred and Sixty Thou&s;and Prote&s;tant Soldiers lo&s;t their Lives in his Service. At length, to put an end to the War, and a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the Kingdom, he de&s;erted his Religion, and turn'd Roman-Catholick; by which means he obtain'd a full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown, ruin'd the League, the Chief Heads of it making their Peace with him, one by one; and at la&s;t concluded the War with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> at the Peace of <HI>Vervin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> however, never withdrew their Loyalty nor their Services from him: The famous Mare&s;chal <HI>de Biron,</HI> the Dukes <HI>de Bouillon, du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and <HI>de la Tremouille,</HI> continuing to do him the mo&s;t faithful and important Services again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled him&s;elf in the Kingdom, and made peace with all the World, the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who had &s;erv'd him &s;o faithfully, and who expected no other Reward than the Security of their Religion and E&s;tates, ob|tain'd from him the famous Edict of <HI>Nantes;</HI> in which
<PB N="256" REF="253">
is particularly &s;tated and &s;tipulated, the Terms of their Liberty, in what places they &s;hould erect their Tem|ples, how they &s;hould hold their Synods and A&s;&s;em|blies: Money was allotted out of the publick Reve|nues, to maintain their Mini&s;ters; Cities were allot|ted to them, for their Security, the Garri&s;ons where|of were to be paid by the King: And the Edict was made perpetual and Irrevocable, by being Entred and Regi&s;tred in the <HI>Parliaments,</HI> and Courts of Ju&s;tice all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But all the Services of the Prote&s;tants to this Great King, by which he was brought to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> nor the &s;olemn Engagement of this Edict, could not pre&s;erve them, but that in the Mini&s;try of Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> under the very next Reign, they were again attack'd, and driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking Arms in their own Defence: Which Cardinal, after three times making Peace, and breaking it again at his plea|&s;ure, compleated the Conque&s;t of them, in the Taking of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> the Prote&s;tants being mi&s;erably de&s;erted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Thirteen Thou&s;and People Starv'd to Death in the Town.</P>
<P>Since this, in the Infancy of the pre&s;ent King, while the Conte&s;ts between the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> and the Queen-Mother were &s;o hot as to break out into a War, the Prote&s;tants, as Subjects only, were not a little in|&s;trumental to the maintaining him in that very Power, which now he makes u&s;e of to their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I think this Hi&s;tory fully makes good the A&s;&s;ertion that the pre&s;ent U&s;age of the Prote&s;tants is both Per|fidious and Ungrateful. Perfidious, as being acted while under the Protection of a Sacred League and Solemn Treaty, and Ungrateful as it is exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e very People, who with their Lives and E&s;tates, rai&s;ed the pre&s;ent Fortune of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> to the Greatne&s;s it now enjoys.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this Account, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="254">
from hence it will appear that the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI> &s;tand on a different foot from other Subjects of that Monarchy, and that his right of Dealing with them, differs from his Power over the re&s;t of his Sub|jects, for they are his Subjects by expre&s;s Stipulations and Agreements, who&s;e Obedience to him has been al|ways allow'd to be Conditional; they have made Peace and War with their Kings, not as Rebels, but as Per&s;ons having a Lawful Right to Plead and to De|fend, their Kings have given them Cautionary Towns for the Performance of the Treaties made with them; a Thing which in its own Nature implies that they might hold tho&s;e Towns again&s;t him, if he did not perform the Po&s;tulata of tho&s;e Treaties, without the Scandal of Rebellion.</P>
<P>So that their Right to the Liberty of their Religion, had an Authority &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie them in taking Arms; nor does any of the <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;tories, that ever I &s;aw, tho' wrote with the greate&s;t Partiality, ever call it a Rebellion, but a War with the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and the Conclu&s;ions were always call'd, <HI>A Peace with the</HI> Hugo|nots, as is Evident thro' <HI>D' Avila</HI>'s whole Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Prote&s;tants of the <HI>&V;pper Hungary</HI> and of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> might in many re&s;pects bear a parallel with this, the Per&s;ecutions and ill-U&s;age of them, ha|ving been after the &s;olemne&s;t Agreement and Treaties with them that could be made; in&s;omuch as that poor Unhappy People being &s;o ab&s;olutely &s;eparated from any Relief of their Brethren of <HI>Germany,</HI> have been forced to fly for Protection to the Enemies of Chri&s;ti|anity, the <HI>Turk,</HI> with whom however they have this Satisfaction, that whatever Bargain they make for their Religion, they are &s;ure they will keep it. And I re|member very well a Bani&s;hed <HI>Hungarian</HI> Mini&s;ter told me, Di&s;cour&s;ing of this very Ca&s;e, <HI>he was &s;orry to &s;ay it, That the Turks, tho' they made them pay Dear for it,</HI>
<PB N="258" REF="255">
<HI>were Ju&s;ter and Truer to their Leagues and Treaties than the Imperiali&s;ts, who call'd them&s;elves Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected here, That while we Ex|claim again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> for their Vio|lence to their Subjects, if we &s;hould do the &s;ame thing to the Papi&s;ts, it would be Practi&s;ing what we Condemn and doing Evil that Good may come.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this is included in what goes before, <HI>viz.</HI> taking the whole Roman Catholick and Prote|&s;tant Party in <HI>Europe</HI> a&s;under, and con&s;idering them as two Collective Bodies divided in Intere&s;t and Religi|on, it &s;eems to me to be ju&s;t that a Retaliation of the Injuries done upon the Members of one Party in one place, may be made upon the Members of the &s;ame Party in another place, by the &s;ame Rule that De|predations of the Subjects of one Prince in War, may be paid by Reprizal upon sny of the Subjects of the &s;ame Prince.</P>
<P>But this may be more fully an&s;wer'd thus, That if the Popi&s;h Subjects of &s;ome Prote&s;tant Governments have &s;o behaved them&s;elves to their Governors, as to make their Extirpation ju&s;t, that Ju&s;tice however &s;u&s;|pended in Mercy to them hitherto, will ab&s;olutely ju|&s;tifie removing them from tho&s;e Governments, and by that means <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> be Executed by the Hands of Publick Ju&s;tice, and one Bani&s;hment be at the &s;ame time both a Puni&s;hment of their &s;everal Crimes, and a Retaliation of the Oppre&s;&s;ions of their Party. This is a Method God Almighty often takes him&s;elf, while he &s;uffers a Puni&s;hment for a publick Crime of le&s;s Guilt to be the Executor of his Vengeance for &s;ome Crime of a higher Nature not known.</P>
<P>To go no farther than <HI>Ireland</HI> for an In&s;tance of this, the pre&s;ent Inhabitants, I mean the Popi&s;h <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> by a Bloody Ma&s;&s;acre of Two Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> in 1641. by little le&s;s intended, and as much as they were able, executed this late War, have de&s;erved no doubt to have been u&s;ed at the Di&s;cretion of the
<PB N="259" REF="256">
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> was more than once con|&s;ulting to Tran&s;plant the whole Nation from that I&s;land. If he had done it, or if it had now been done, I am of the Opinion, no Nation in the World wou'd have Tax'd us with Inju&s;tice, and I do verily think <HI>Oliver</HI> Acted with more Genero&s;ity than Di&s;cretion in omitting it; for this is certain, that if he had done it, this la&s;t War and the Expence of &s;o much Trea&s;ure as it co&s;t this Nation, and the Ruine of &s;o many Thou|&s;and <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Families, who were driven from thence by King <HI>James,</HI> all the De&s;truction at <HI>London-Derry,</HI> the Sickne&s;s at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and the Blood of 150000 people, who at lea&s;t one way or other, on both &s;ides, peri&s;h'd in it, had been prevented.</P>
<P>It may be enquired whithere <HI>Oliver</HI> de&s;ign'd to Tran&s;plant them, I could an&s;wer directly to that al&s;o; but 'tis &s;ufficient to my purpo&s;e to &s;ay, had he clear'd the I&s;land of them, it had been no matter at all to us whither they had gone, and the King of <HI>France</HI> has &s;et a Rule for &s;uch as Bani&s;h their Subjects to let them go where they plea&s;e, and then they certainly &s;eparate; whereas had he &s;ent the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to any particular place, they wou'd have been &s;o many and &s;o United, they might po&s;&s;ibly have come back again with Swords in their Hands, and ha' bidden fair for another <HI>Hugo|not</HI> War,</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;een among the Letters of State written by Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> who was his Secretary for the Foreign Di&s;patches, a Letter written to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> wherein by way of Argument to prevail for &s;ome Ea&s;e to the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> he propo&s;es a Confe|deracy with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and all their Reform'd Friends, to reduce the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to a Nece&s;&s;ity of giving better Conditions to the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> and &s;eems to Threat|en to Expel all the Roman Catholicks in <HI>Engiand, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> out of his Dominions. I remem|ber upon Di&s;cour&s;ing of this pa&s;&s;age in &s;ome Company
<PB N="260" REF="257">
one asked, <HI>What if he had?</HI> and another by way of Re|partee, made An&s;wer, <HI>Then there wou'd have been none left.</HI> I repeat it not for any great Wit in the An&s;wer but to Introduce the Que&s;tion,</P>
<P>What if he had?</P>
<P N="1">1. If he had, po&s;&s;ibly we had not been troubled with any <HI>Popi&s;h Plot</HI> in 1678. nor none of the Bloody Con&s;equences of it; we had had no <HI>Sham-Plot</HI> upon that, no <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, Sidney,</HI> nor <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> Murthered; no Blood lo&s;t in an Inva&s;ion by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> nor Cruel Executions in the We&s;t; we had had no <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Succe&s;&s;or, no Standing Army, no Bi&s;hops &s;ent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> no Inva&s;ion of Charters nor Priviledge of Univer&s;ities; no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We had had no Nuncio from <HI>Rome,</HI> to take his Progre&s;s over the Kingdom, no Fire-Works for a Sham-Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> nor no Ma&s;s Sung in <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Chappel, no Seminaries or Prie&s;ts, nor Nunneries of Whores, at <HI>Chel&s;ea, Lincoln-Inn Fields,</HI> or <HI>Hammer|&s;mith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In &s;hort, we had had no War of Nine Years to re&s;tore a Popi&s;h King, the Nation had not &s;pent 60 Millions Sterling, nor lo&s;t 200000 of the Stoute&s;t of her Inhabitants to Maintain her Liberty; King <HI>William</HI> had been King in Right of his Wife, and a Peaceable Admi&s;&s;ion had been given him.</P>
<P>In all probability this had been the Con&s;equence, if <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> had &s;ent them all out of the King|dom. <HI>I be&s;hrew his Heart he did not.</HI></P>
<P>I do not pretend to lead my Reader to any Politi|cal Rea&s;ons why this &s;hou'd be done now; our Go|vernours are be&s;t Judges of the publick Intere&s;t. But thus far, I think, may be a&s;&s;umed without danger of Religion.</P>
<P>If the Nation &s;hou'd think fit in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Mi&s;eries of our poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Brethren of <HI>France</HI> to Retaliate their U&s;age upon the Roman Catholicks of
<PB N="261" REF="258">
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the following Con&s;equences would in all probability en&s;ue, which whether it wou'd be ju&s;t in the whole, or Beneficial to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> in particular, I leave to the Judgment of Impartial Rea|ders to Con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. It might be a means, by the Interce&s;&s;ion of Par|ties, to procure &s;ome rea&s;onable Conditions for the poor <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> as the Stopping the Mare&s;|chal <HI>Boufflers</HI> at the Surrender of <HI>Namure</HI> procur'd Ju&s;tice to the Impri&s;oned Garri&s;ons of <HI>Dein&s;e</HI> and <HI>Dix|mude.</HI> This is a Practice too well known in the War to need any Contention, where the putting a Pri&s;oner of War to Death, or any other Breach of Articles has been requited buy putting &s;ome other Pri&s;oner of War to Death on the contrary Side; and tho' the latter be an innocent Per&s;on, <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> is the Word, the Ju&s;tice of it is not di&s;puted.</P>
<P N="2">2. It wou'd put the&s;e Kingdoms in a Condition to Entertain and Relieve that great Multitude of Di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Chri&s;tians, with the very Sub&s;tance of their Ad|ver&s;aries, and the King of <HI>France</HI> might, if he pleas'd, make the Roman Catholicks Amends, by giving them the E&s;tates of the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> or what other Way he thought fit.</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t certain, that the Roman Catholicks of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd not have half the Rea&s;on to Complain of hard U&s;age that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have, they have no Leagues or Capitulations to &s;how for their Permi&s;&s;ion; the Laws of the Kingdom are expre&s;ly again&s;t them, and they have in all Reigns for 150 Years pa&s;t, been the Di&s;turbers of the Peace of it; they re|fu&s;e now to Swear Allegiance to the Government, and if they do not Di&s;turb it, it is Owing to their want of Power, not their want of Will.</P>
<P>But if they had all tho&s;e Defences to make, which have been hinted, on behalf of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> they wou'd have no body to thank for &s;uch U&s;age, but
<PB N="262" REF="259">
their own Friends. And the Pope, if he ow'd them &s;o much Care, might u&s;e his Intere&s;t with the King of <HI>France,</HI> to let the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> enjoy their Liberty, in or|der to &s;ave them from the &s;ame Fate.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, object again&s;t the receiving &s;uch va&s;t Numbers of Foreigners among us, as Prejudicial to the Intere&s;t of Trade, and to our own Manufacturers and Inhabitants, by Eating the Bread out of our Months, and Starving our own Poor.</P>
<P>This is an Argument would require a little Volume to An&s;wer; but in General, I pre&s;ume to Affirm, That no Number of Foreigners can be Prejudicial to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> let it be never &s;o great. Number of Inhabitants, is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom; and if we had a Million of People in <HI>England,</HI> more than we have, let them be of what Nation they would, it would be far from being a Damage to us.</P>
<P>'Tis true, if the&s;e Million of People were all Arti|&s;ans, Manufacturers, it would be &s;ome detriment to our Poor who are employ'd in tho&s;e particular Manufa|ctures: But allow one third to be Arti&s;ans, one third Labourers, Husbandmen or Sailors, and one third Merchants, Shop-keepers or Gentlemen; and if the greate&s;t Number that can be &s;uppo&s;ed came to &s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> it could be no Injury, but a va&s;t Advantage to the Kingdom in general: And it will appear by this One particular, well examin'd.</P>
<P>An Addition of a Million of People, &s;uppo&s;e that were the Number, would devour a proportion'd quan|tity of Corn and Fle&s;h for Food and Drink, and a pro|portioned quantity of Manufactures for Cloth and Hou&s;hold&s;tuff; the one employs more Land, and the other more People? Now 'tis apparent, we have in <HI>England</HI> more Land lies unimprov'd, common, and wa&s;te, than would feed a va&s;t many People more than we have; and we have a Staple of Wooll, never to be exhau&s;ted. In Manufactures, the more Lands we im|prove,
<PB N="263" REF="260">
the greater the Rents will be, and the greater the general Stock of the Nation will be; and the more Manufactures are made, the better the Poor are em|ploy'd, and the Richer the Manufacturer is made.</P>
<P>Many other Arguments might be u&s;ed, to prove, That the coming Over of Foreigners can be no general prejudice to the Nation, as to Trade. But that is not the main thing here. If the Roman Catholick Princes pur&s;ue their <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects with &s;uch Cruelty, and drive them into Bani&s;hment and Exile, to &s;eek Relief in Foreign Countries the Ca&s;e &s;eems to &s;peak for it &s;elf, the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> can have no readier way, either to prevent the Mi&s;erics of tho&s;e poor per&s;ecuted People, or to relieve them in their Exile, than by dealing with the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in their Dominions in the &s;ame manner, and Inviting the &s;aid per&s;ecuted <HI>French</HI> to come and live in the E&s;tates and in the Places of their Adver&s;a|ries. This is <HI>Lex Talionis:</HI> And this is a way that would &s;oon tire the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> out. For I think I may be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e there are much the greater number of <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> among the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> than there are of <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI> among the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> and the Exile of the Par|ties would al&s;o di&s;ter, as to Place. For, generally &s;peaking, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Countries are the be&s;t for Strangers to live in, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> People are the Tra|ding People of the World; therefore the Exile of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> would be le&s;s to their di&s;advantage, than the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> of <HI>England, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who mu&s;t apply them&s;elves to Countries where there are few Manufactures, &s;mall Trade, and but very indifferent Means for a Stranger to Live. So that the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Exiles would be in much the wor&s;e Circum&s;tances: And there is no que&s;tion, but when|ever the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hall find it need|ful to u&s;e this Remedy, the Roman-Catholick Powers will find it for their Intere&s;t to make &s;ome Cartel, or Condition, upon which all their Subjects, tho' they
<PB N="264" REF="261">
are <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> may enjoy &s;ome &s;ort of Liberty in their own Native Countries; and &s;o Per&s;ecution, as well as War, might end in an an Univer&s;al Happy Peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> both in Matters of Religion, as well as Civil Affairs, which has &s;o often been attempted by other Methods, to &s;o little purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER to Mr. <HI>HOW,</HI> By Way of REPLY TO HIS CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PREFACE TO AN Enquiry into the Occa&s;ional Conformity of DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;uch an Account as you have given of your &s;elf in the Five fir&s;t Pages of your Book, with the Aver&s;ion you have to any thing which &s;hou'd interrupt you in your more <HI>Reclu&s;e</HI> Studies; I pre&s;ume no Man cou'd imagin you would break tho|rough your own Mea&s;ures to attack a <HI>poor Prefacer,</HI> as
<PB N="265" REF="262">
you call me, and wholly quitting the Argument, amu&s;e the World, and content your &s;elf to La&s;h the Author with the Severity of your Wit.</P>
<P>Herein, Sir, I mu&s;t own, that not only your Oppo|nent, but all the Town &s;eem Di&s;appointed exceeding|ly, that Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who thinks the Subject not worth An&s;wering, &s;hou'd trouble his Head, or &s;pend his Time about the Impertinence of a <HI>&s;orry Prefacer.</HI></P>
<P>When I Addre&s;s'd the Preface to you, I thought I had &s;o carefully Revis'd both it and the Book, that, as I mention'd to you, I cou'd no-where be Tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and Good Manners.</P>
<P>And tho' I wou'd always make them both my Rule, yet I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to it more now than or|dinarily, by how much the per&s;on to whom, and the per&s;ons of whom I wrote, were equally known and very much valued by me; and I did not que&s;tion but I &s;hou'd either not be Reply'd to at all, or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> the Civility of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and the Force and Vigour of a <HI>Scholar.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince it &s;eems good to you, Sir, to de&s;cend &s;o far below your &s;elf as to quit the Di&s;pute offer'd, and fall upon me per&s;onally, and to mix Raillery and Reproach with your Argument, <HI>which, I am &s;ure, you know too well to think betters the Cau&s;e:</HI> You mu&s;t blame your &s;elf, Sir, for Obliging me in my own Defence to be a little freer with you than otherwi&s;e I &s;hou'd have thought had become me.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, &s;hou'd I have engag'd with you, even in my own Defence, knowing I am to &s;truggle with &s;o unequal a Match both as to your Learning and Repu|tation, had I not &s;een your Book differ &s;o much from your con&s;tant Character; and pardon me, Sir, for the Word, <HI>in many Places from the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince I am oblig'd thus publickly to Animad|vert upon my Superiors, for &s;uch I own you to be both in Learning and Office,</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="263">
I &s;hall ask your Leave to lay down &s;everal Mi&s;takes upon which I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e you have gone in the Cen&s;ures which you have made; which Suppo&s;itions I draw from the whole Tenour of your Writing.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, that you are mi&s;taken in the&s;e Four Points, in the <HI>Per&s;on, Temper, Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Intention</HI> of the Author,</P>
<P>Which Mi&s;takes, I &s;hall venture to &s;uppo&s;e, are the Rea&s;ons which moved you to treat your Adver&s;ary with &s;o much indecent Contempt.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Temper:</HI> 'Tis true, Sir, I have cho&s;en to conceal my Name; and tho' bating Humane Frailty, Sins and Misfortunes, I know no Rea&s;on why the Argument &s;hould be a&s;ham'd of the Author, or the Author of the Argument: Yet when I con&s;ider'd how con&s;tant a practice it is in the World to An&s;wer an Argument with Recriminations in&s;tead of Rea&s;onings, I thought it be&s;t to continue retir'd, that the Ca&s;e I had enter'd upon might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of the Meanne&s;s and Imperfections of the Author.</P>
<P>I need not go back to the In&s;tance of our Saviour, who&s;e Arguments were Confronted with the Con|tempt of that Que&s;tion, <HI>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</HI> For I find that even Mr. <HI>How</HI> him&s;elf wou'd have &s;earch'd my Character to have compleated his Remarks with Per&s;onal Reflections.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my Name has to the Argument; it cou'd be only u&s;eful to furni&s;h you with &s;omething in my Character to Reproach me with; which, <HI>God knows you might have found enough of.</HI></P>
<P>But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand? The Occa&s;ional Conformity of Di&s;&s;enters is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either &s;ide, but by Truth, Scripture, and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Thou was't altogether born in Sin,</HI> &s;ays the High-Prie&s;t,
<PB N="267" REF="264">
and the Elders of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to the Poor Man whom Chri&s;t had healed; <HI>and doe&s;t thou Teach us?</HI> And yet the poor Man was in the Right; and if I am &s;o, tho' I was the meane&s;t and mo&s;t &s;candalous of Scrib|lers, is my Argument the wor&s;e?</P>
<P>But, Sir, to An&s;wer all tho&s;e Particulars, and let you know that I am not altogether &s;o &s;hy of my Name as you imagine, I &s;hall give you a Genuine hone&s;t Ac|count of my &s;elf, and then my Name is at your Service.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, I am to tell you, that I am, and acknow|ledge my &s;elf to be, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a &s;trong Aver&s;ion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of Religion; and do think that the Ca&s;e in hand is be allow'd no le&s;s: And therefore wrote the Enquiry with Two very hone&s;t De&s;igns, <HI>viz,</HI> To &s;ee if by Strength of Argu|ment I cou'd receive Satisfaction; and to Explode, and, as far as in me lies, to Oppo&s;e the Practice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Had your Book given me, or any Body el&s;e that I can meet with, <HI>who&s;e Judgment is to be valu|ed,</HI> the Satisfaction I de&s;ir'd; I a&s;&s;ure you, I am &s;o little fond of an Opinion, becau&s;e it is mine, that I &s;hou'd not have been a&s;ham'd to have own'd my &s;elf mi&s;taken; and po&s;&s;ibly have &s;hown as much Humility in Acknowledging it, as you think I have Pride in Oppo&s;ing.</P>
<P>As to Per&s;onal Mi&s;carriages and Misfortunes, of which no Man has more, and which, perhaps may weaken the Reputation of the Author, but I am &s;ure ought not of my Argument: To them I &s;hall only &s;ay, God <HI>in his Merciful Providence has heal'd the La&s;t, and, I hope, has Pardon'd the Fir&s;t:</HI> And if &s;o, I am upon even Terms in point of Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>By this you may &s;ee I am &s;en&s;ible of the Beam in my own Eye, and have for &s;ome years taken up the part of a Penitent on that very account; but did never un|der&s;tand that thereby I was barr'd from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to the Profe&s;&s;ion of a
<PB N="268" REF="265">
Party in General, of whom, <HI>though unworthy, I</HI> was a Member.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, am I any-where guilty of Judging another, where the Ca&s;e is not &s;o plain, as that it really &s;eems to &s;peak it &s;elf: For I mu&s;t remember al&s;o, that we are no more to call Good, Evil, or Evil, Good, than we are to Judge one another.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I am gone over my own Character; and &s;hall only demand this from you of Right, That, &s;o far as Truth and Hone&s;ty is on my &s;ide, it may not, nor ought not to be de&s;pis'd for being u&s;her'd in by an un|worthy in&s;trument.</P>
<P>And 'tis &s;trange, Sir, that you who Animadvert upon me for Judging, &s;hould &s;o &s;everely judge me, and that wrongfully too, as &s;hall appear in the Particu|lars of this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be &s;atisfi'd to &s;ay le&s;s to this point on the&s;e Accounts, becau&s;e I mu&s;t put in a <HI>Caveat</HI> again&s;t Per&s;onal Reflections as unfair in the Di&s;pute: He that plea&s;es fir&s;t to Confute the Argument, is welcome to &s;how his Wit in Satyrizing upon the Follies and Af|flictions of the Author: And there I leave it, and proceed to what I conceive is your third Mi&s;take about me.</P>
<P><HI>Viz.</HI> My profe&s;&s;ion. And this you &s;eem to make plain, while from the 13th, to the 24th page, you treat me as an Independent, and &s;pend your time to Reply to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rticular Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s in di&s;pute between You and Them: which, with Submi&s;&s;ion, I conceive to be no|thing at all to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>P</HI> 30, 31, 32, I am talk'd with as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> and <HI>Leveller;</HI> what of the&s;e <HI>Prin|ciples</HI> any where appears in the Enquiry, I confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s to know; nor, Sir, have you been &s;o kind to lay it down.</P>
<P>Indeed I own my &s;elf &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee you run on in An&s;wering the &s;crupulous Indepen|dent

<P>I a&s;&s;ure you I am no <HI>Independent,</HI> nor <HI>Fifth-Monar|chy-man,</HI> nor <HI>Leveller.</HI> You have &s;hown your Lear|ning, Sir, and Confuted an Error incon&s;i&s;tent with Civil Society: Very well; but this had been better done by it &s;elf; it had no more relation to the Ca&s;e in hand, than a Lecture again&s;t the <HI>Alchoran;</HI> and you may as well conjecture me to be a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> from any thing in the Book that looks like either. But, Sir, &s;ince I am led by you to give an account of my profe&s;&s;ion, which, I hope I &s;hall always be ready to do; I &s;hall do it in few words: That I am of the &s;ame Cla&s;s, and in the &s;ame Denomination of a Di&s;&s;enter with your &s;elf, your Of|fice excepted, and am willing to be guided by, and to practice the Great Rule of Chri&s;tian Charity in all the proper and legal Extents of it: Indeed I have more need to practice it than you, becau&s;e I &s;tand more in need of it from others, with re&s;pect to the Cau&s;es al|ready nam'd. And however, by wre&s;ting Words, and mi&s;taking my Intentions, you are plea&s;ed to &s;ee nothing of it; I am not yet convinc'd that I have broken that Great Chri&s;tian Rule of Charity, in any thing I have written.</P>
<P>I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you are mi&s;taken, which is in my <HI>Intentions;</HI> in which you ra&s;hly, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, wrongfully judge me, how|ever cautious you wou'd have me be of judging others: But, Sir, <HI>Humanum e&s;t Errare;</HI> you are no more In|fallible, I &s;ee, than I, and are fallen into the &s;ame ra&s;h Error you Reprove me for with &s;o much Severity; by judging, that the principal De&s;ign of this Book
<PB N="270" REF="267">
was to reflect upon a Worthy Gentlemen, who is nam'd in the <HI>Preface:</HI> And in one place you are plea|&s;ed to join me with the Party who Oppos'd him, and bring me in making my Court to them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, Sir, I &s;hall make appear to be not only Mi&s;takes, but groundle&s;s Mi&s;takes; &s;uch as nothing but the &s;ame Thoughts which put you out of Tem|per, cou'd lead you into: And I can &s;olemnly Ap|peal in the Form you have &s;et down, that you have wrong'd me in your Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> was publi&s;h'd Three years ago, and therefore cou'd not be de&s;ign'd as a Per&s;on|al Invective again&s;t the Gentleman you &s;peak of: All that can be &s;aid, is, That the Cau&s;e being again given, the Re-printing it was de&s;ign'd as a Reproof to the Practice: and &s;o much I own. As for <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> I am indifferent; <HI>if the Coat fits any Body, let them wear it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, I declare my &s;elf, if of any Party, I am, and ever was for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and for the putting &s;uch Men into Magi&s;tracy, who, in Con|currence with the King, our Supream Magi&s;trate, wou'd protect and pre&s;erve that Liberty. And, as a Per&s;on every way qualified to execute a Tru&s;t of &s;o much Honour, whether profitable or not, I won't examine, I gave my Vote for Sir <HI>Thomas Abney,</HI> and &s;hou'd ha' done &s;o, If I had the power of Ten Thou|&s;and Voices; and no Man has more Re&s;pect for, or Opinion of his Hone&s;ty and Ability than my &s;elf: Nor have I, God be thank'd, any Occa&s;ion to &s;ay this to flatter him; <HI>for I neither want his Favour, nor fear his Anger.</HI></P>
<P>Herein therefore I pre&s;ume to &s;ay you have been entirely mi&s;taken; and the&s;e Errors have led you to wa&s;te your Time, and the Reader's too, in making needle&s;s Remarks, and An&s;wering tho&s;e People who never Oppos'd you.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="268">
I come now to that part of your Book which re|&s;pects the Ca&s;e in hand; which, as it is the lea&s;t part, and indeed &s;eems to agree with the Title, that it is only a <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> of the Preface; <HI>for really with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, there is very little An&s;wer to the Fact:</HI> So it re|quires not that I &s;hou'd Reply to the Argument; for I &s;ee none, but that drawing back the Curtain which you have &s;pread over the Subject, I &s;hou'd &s;et it in a True Light, that all Men may judge by their own Con&s;ciences, and the Scripture-Rule, and take care they be not di&s;tingui&s;h'd out of their Rea&s;on and Religion by the Cunning and Artifice of Words.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e therefore, Sir, to admit me to run over your Book with as mode&s;t Animadver&s;ions as my ju&s;t De|fence will allow; and I am content to &s;tand Correct|ed, where I fail in point of Decency.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, You quarrel with me for a <HI>Breach of Kindne&s;s and Equity, in hiding my own Name and Revealing yours.

<P>Truly, Sir, as to the Fir&s;t, I thought a publick Ap|peal to you, who are a publick Per&s;on, had been no Sin apain&s;t Kindne&s;s or Equity; if it be, I ask your Pardon.</P>
<P>As to my Concealing my Name, I have given you my Rea&s;ons already; and as to my Expo&s;ing yours, had you thought fit to have Replied to the Book which lay Three years unan&s;wer'd, without being addre&s;s'd to any per&s;on in particular, you had been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as the Author.</P>
<P>But the Enquiry being unan&s;wer'd, gave &s;ome peo|ple more prejudice again&s;t the Integrity of Di&s;&s;en|ters in general, than I cou'd wi&s;h to have found; up|on
<PB N="272" REF="269">
which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have the Matter di&s;cu&s;s'd, if po&s;&s;ible; and knew no Man more concern|ed to do it, <HI>nor more capable than your &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is your An&s;wering me &s;uch a Di&s;appointment as you are pleas'd to mention; but that you &s;hou'd attempt it, and do it to no more purpo&s;e, is, I con|fe&s;s, more Di&s;appointment to me than any thing I cou'd ha' met with.</P>
<P>Whether, Sir, the Indifferency you are &s;o pleas'd with in your Temper, be Congruous to your Profe&s;|&s;ion as a <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, I</HI> &s;hall not examine: Whe|ther you that are Pa&s;tor of a Di&s;&s;enting Church, and Admini&s;ter the Ordinances of Chri&s;t to a Select Peo|ple, in a way Di&s;&s;enting from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and thereby maintain a Schi&s;m in the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, ought to be &s;o indifferent as to boa&s;t that you never per&s;waded any Man to Conform, or not to Conform, I leave it to your &s;elf to con&s;ider; I am &s;ure, if I was arriv'd to that Coldne&s;s in the matter my &s;elf, I wou'd Conform immediately; for I think what I affirm'd in the <HI>Enquiry</HI> Page remains a Truth unan&s;wer'd by you: <HI>That Schi&s;m from a True E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of Chri&s;t, is a great Sin; and if I can Conform, I ought to Conform.</HI></P>
<P>From this Declaration of your own indifferency to meddle in Matters of Controver&s;ie, with your Rea&s;ons for it, which I &s;uppo&s;e you wou'd have taken as Intro|ductory to what follows, you are pleas'd to proceed <HI>very angrily</HI> to examine why I engage you in this Quar|rel: I have given you an Account of it already with all the Hone&s;ty and Plainne&s;s I can, and I thought a Per&s;on in your Place wou'd never have Re&s;ented the being put upon the Defence of his Profe&s;&s;ion, or being Civilly ask'd a Que&s;tion about it; and I cannot but ob&s;erve how carefully you avoid being engag'd in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I ought to have been well a&s;&s;ur'd, you &s;ay, (1.)
<PB N="273" REF="270">
<HI>That you did advi&s;e one way or the other;</HI> Or, (2.) <HI>That you ought to have done &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Really, Sir, I think it immaterial whether you <HI>were,</HI> or on; or, whether you <HI>ought,</HI> or no; for I never Charg'd you with the fir&s;t, or affirm'd the la&s;t; but only ask'd this fair Que&s;tion:</P>
<P>Whether it was allow'd by Di&s;&s;enters in general, or by your Congregation in particular? To which Que&s;tion you give no An&s;wer.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall an&s;wer you hone&s;tly and directly: I am a&s;&s;ur'd, as far as Rationally I can be, by con&s;equences of things, <HI>that you have not advi&s;ed one way or other?</HI> Nor do I affirm you ought to have done &s;o, unle&s;s the Per&s;on concern'd, applied to you for Advice in Point of Con&s;cience on the Ca&s;e; if he did, I do not &s;ee how you could decline it. So that to me, it &s;eems, you either were oblig'd, or not oblig'd, as the Application of the Per&s;on concern'd might alter the Ca&s;e: I do not &s;ay you were oblig'd officiou&s;ly to tender your Advice in the Ca&s;e: <HI>If I am wrong here, I &s;hall acknowledge my Er|ror when I am better inform'd.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing will come clo&s;e to the Point, Whe|ther it be a <HI>Fault,</HI> an <HI>unlawful Action,</HI> or no, for a Di&s;&s;enter, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> to hold Occa&s;ional Communion with the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and, at the &s;ame time continue in, or return to his Relative conjunction with a Sepa|rate Church?</P>
<P>That it is not a &s;inful Act &s;imply to have Commu|nion with the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, I willingly agree. But &s;ince on this Point depends the Weight of our pre|&s;ent Di&s;pute, I mu&s;t conclude, That I think 'tis a &s;in|ful Act circum&s;tantially and conjunctively.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I wou'd be rightly under&s;tood, I &s;hall endeavour to be Explicit, tho' I run the hazard of being counted impertinent.</P>
<P>I have laid down the Ca&s;e, I thought, fairly, and of which you are pleas'd to take no Notice, in the <HI>En|quiry,</HI> Page 12.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="271">
<HI>He who Di&s;&s;ents from an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church from any other Rea&s;ons but &s;uch as the&s;e; That he really believes the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church is not of the pure&s;t In&s;titution, but that be can &s;erve God in a Form more agreeable to his Will; and that accordingly 'tis his Duty to do it &s;o, and no otherwi&s;e: Such a one ought to Conform, becau&s;e to make a Wilful Schi&s;m in the Church, is doubtle&s;s a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it.</HI></P>
<P>If then I am guided by this real Principle of Con|&s;cience to Di&s;&s;ent, how can I Conform without Sin|ning again&s;t that Con&s;cience, by which only my Di&s;|&s;enting is made Lawful?</P>
<P>And thus, Sir, I am brought to my Argument again: Of which I &s;hall give you this &s;hort Ab&s;tract; and you or any body el&s;e, are welcome to be angry with me, if you will be pleas'd fir&s;t to An&s;wer it:</P>
<P><HI>That he who Di&s;&s;ents from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, ex|cept from a true Principle of Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who Conforms to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church again&s;t his Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who both Di&s;&s;ents and Conforms at the &s;ame time and in the &s;ame Point of Religion, mu&s;t be guilty of one of the&s;e great Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who has committed either of the&s;e Sins, ought not to be receiv'd again on either &s;ide on any other Terms than as a Penitent.</HI></P>
<P>I do not examine, as I hinted then, whether the Gentleman you would embroil me with, be thus guil|ty; <HI>be that to him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now come to your Di&s;tinctions: Indeed Sir, I believe as you &s;ay, that taking which &s;ide you will, you may puzzle the mo&s;t of plain people, who are but of ordinary Under&s;tandings in the Contro|ver&s;y about Ceremonies: And give me leave to add, That &s;uch is the Subtilty and Nicety of Sophi&s;tical Rea&s;onings, that Men may almo&s;t Di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves
<PB N="275" REF="272">
into, and out of any Opinion; and &s;ome Peo|ple, who are Ma&s;ters of the Art of Nice Arguing, too often lo&s;e both Them&s;elves and their Religion in the Labyrinchs of Words: <HI>School Divinity and Practical Chri&s;tianity are Two things,</HI> and &s;eldom under&s;tood by the &s;ame Heads.</P>
<P>But, Sir, with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect, and &s;ome Concern, let me tell you, I did not think to find all the Difference between the Di&s;&s;enters and the Church of <HI>England</HI> dwindl'd into <HI>Three additional Appendices, in which we have &s;ome Difference, and &s;o:</HI> and this from Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who is Pa&s;tor of a Separate Church.</P>
<P>If we differ from them in Trifles, or have but a Trifling Difference, I think we can never ju&s;tify ma|king &s;o large a Cha&s;m in the Church; we have much to an&s;wer for, without que&s;tion, in the too fatal Di|vi&s;ions of this Nation, if it has all been occa&s;ion'd by a few &s;mall Appendices.</P>
<P>If our Differences are not Matters of Con&s;cience I have no more to &s;ay; if they are, 'tis a My&s;tery yet hidden from the Common Under&s;tandings, how they can be fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on from a Principle of Con&s;cience, and then wav'd without acting again&s;t that Con&s;ci|ence, which only could ju&s;tify the fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ting on them: If you can Di&s;tingui&s;h us into this, I am mi&s;|taken.</P>
<P>I allow your Di&s;tinctions of Sins, which are Con&s;i|&s;tent or Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian State to be Orthodox and Right.</P>
<P>I allow your Di&s;tinctions of Negative and Affirma|tive Precepts, and, according to my weak Talent, a|gree with you in them.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;equence you draw, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, does not reach the Ca&s;e; which is, That &s;crupulous Per&s;ons ought to be fully per&s;waded in their own Minds; and Fellow-Chri&s;tians were not to Judge, but to Receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="273">
This you have an&s;wer'd your &s;elf, <HI>P.</HI> 13. to be meant in dubious and &s;mall Matters: And if we mu&s;t &s;tick here, we are next to Examine, Whether the Differ|ence between Us and the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church be on|ly in dubious and &s;mall Matters; if it be, I know not how we &s;hall Ward off the Below of being guilty of Schi&s;m; the Sin of which I &s;uppo&s;e you will not di&s;pute.

<P>If the&s;e are your &s;mall things, I am content to &s;tand by it, and ready to prove, as I &s;aid in the <HI>Enquiry:</HI></P>
<P>That whoever Separates from this Church, and at the &s;ame time Conforms to it; by Conforming, denies his Di&s;&s;ent being Lawful; or, by his Di&s;&s;enting, Damns his Conforming as Sinful.</P>
<P>All this, Sir, you have not thought fit to touch upon, for Rea&s;ons which you know be&s;t; and I really won|der you &s;hou'd take &s;o much pains to Cavil at me and a &s;imple Preface, which really was not worth your while; and when you have led your &s;elf into the Ar|gument, take no notice of the thing it &s;elf, as it is Ob|jected,

but Di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o nicely about the &s;maller mat|ters, and omit the greater.</P>
<P>If we differ from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church in &s;mall things only, we are to blame to make the Breach &s;o wide. Was it for &s;mall and dubious Things only that we &s;uffer'd Proce&s;s of the Law, Excommunications, Seizures of our E&s;tates, and Impri&s;onment of our Per&s;ons? And &s;ince you are pleas'd to bring in that Honourable Gentleman, &s;peaking in the fir&s;t Per&s;on to the Point, as an Inference drawn from your Di&s;tincti|ons, and your &s;elf telling us what he may perhaps do;</P>
<P>Give me leave to go through tho&s;e Suppo&s;ititions Ca&s;es with you, Sir. <HI>As to the particular Per&s;on, you concern him in it, not I.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;ay, <HI>He may have Arguments &s;o &s;pecious, that &s;uppo&s;ing he Err, may Impo&s;e upon the Judgment, and thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent, Di&s;cern|ing; and &V;pright-hearted Man, &s;o as to make him think that which is perhaps an Error, his pre&s;ent Duty, and &s;o not offer Violence to his Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>I An&s;wer: Admit he does &s;o; yet while you at the &s;ame time allow <HI>he Errs,</HI> that is, Sins; why ought not he to be admoni&s;hed to Repent of that Sin, before he be receiv'd again into Communion? This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent: You grant (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) a Man is to do the part of a Penitent for a Fault; and this Error is a Fault, though it were an Error of Ig|norance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then you &s;ay, <HI>P.</HI> 18. <HI>As judging &s;uch a Church true as to E&s;&s;entials, he may think (Occa&s;ion inviting) he hath greater Rea&s;on, though it be Defective in Accidents, to Communicate with it &s;ometimes, than to &s;hun its Commu|nion always.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;ay this &s;eems a Sophi&s;m in Religion; for allow he may think &s;o, you mu&s;t allow he ought not to think &s;o. And why <HI>Occa&s;ion inviting?</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="275">
Why not <HI>Occa&s;ion compelling?</HI> 'Tis manife&s;t, For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> cou'd not <HI>compel,</HI> why &s;hou'd <HI>Occa&s;ion invite?</HI></P>
<P>I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman; but of Others I can prove, That Force cou'd not <HI>compel</HI> them, but Occa&s;ion, that is, Honour and Preferment cou'd <HI>invite</HI> them. Now if you plea&s;e to Reconcile this for me, I &s;hall be gotten over one Point; Whe|ther a Man can ju&s;tify &s;uffering to the Ruin, perhaps of his Family, rather than comply with that which he may do without impo&s;ing upon his Con&s;cience, and which, Occa&s;ion inviting, he may judge lawful?</P>
<P>You have another Di&s;tinction which, I confe&s;s, hardly think to be Rational, that is, Unprofitable Pre|ferment, <HI>Page.</HI> Fir&s;t, I neither under&s;tand that the In&s;tance you are upon is Unprofitable, nor believe it; nor that the Epithite can be proper to the word, for that which is unprofitable, cannot be a Preferment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve here, Sir, that the Conformity exacted in the late Reigns, was not &s;o large as what the&s;e Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with volunta|rily. Now as to the Ceremonies you in&s;i&s;t on, and which indeed I do not, as the way of Admini&s;tration Kneeling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was allow'd to be &s;o indifferent than, that many receiv'd in the Church Standing. But when the&s;e <HI>Unprofitable Preferments,</HI> as you plea&s;e to call them, invite, they &s;eek of them&s;elves what before they cou'd not be forc'd to.</P>
<P N="3">3. You ask us another Que&s;tion: <HI>What if &s;ome have thought</HI> that <HI>alone a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for their Occa&s;ional Communion with a Church, with whom they have not a con&s;tant Communion, That they may te&s;tify to the World they Decline it not as no Church, but &s;o far practically own it as the Rea&s;on of the thing requires; may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to do this, as thinking it a good Rea&s;on, whether it be &s;o or no, without going again&s;t Con&s;cience herein?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>It may be's,</HI> and <HI>Why may not's,</HI> are put in to make out what you &s;aid <HI>Page.</HI> that you cou'd puzzle a mean Under&s;tand|ing

both ways; and, I thank God, you are driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Arts. But to let you &s;ee the&s;e Suppo&s;itions may be replied to;</P>
<P N="1">1. Sir, the Church of <HI>England</HI> however, mu&s;t own Her &s;elf very much oblig'd to &s;uch Gentlemen who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputation.</P>

<P><HI>Page</HI> 19. you are pleas'd to Object for me: <HI>Since, Sir, you think it not unlawful to Communicate with &s;uch a Church &s;ometimes, why &s;hou'd you not (for Common Or|der &s;ake) do it always?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, if you plea&s;e to give me leave to ask Que&s;ti|ons for my &s;elf, I wou'd &s;tate it &s;omething more fair|ly to the Ca&s;e in hand, thus: <HI>Since, Sir, you think it not Unlawful to Communicate with &s;uch a Church &s;ome|times, why &s;hou'd you not, to avoid the ju&s;t Imputation of Schi&s;m, which is a great Sin, have done it always?</HI> And why never do it, but when upon an Occa&s;ion of Pre|ferment inviting, you find it nece&s;&s;ary to protect you from the penalty of the Law?</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd ha' been very glad you had &s;tated this Que&s;tion fully, and &s;uppo&s;e what An&s;wer you plea&s;e; for <HI>upon my word,</HI> I <HI>can &s;uppo&s;e none,</HI> unle&s;s I wou'd bring him in, owning the Crime, and repenting of it; which I &s;hou'd be glad to hear of.</P>

<P>Here, Sir, <HI>viz.</HI> at your 20th Page, I mu&s;t leave you to combat with the <HI>Independents</HI> and let them an|&s;wer for them&s;elves; I am not at all concern'd in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>And you &s;pend three or four <HI>Pages</HI> as an Advocate for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> concerning Modes and Ge&s;tures; in which, I am &s;ure, I am far from placing the lea&s;t Weight, where &s;erious <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is to be found; and God forbid either you or I, Sir, &s;hou'd be found making a Rent in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Union of this <HI>Church</HI> and Nation, if their Kneeling at the Sa|crament, or the U&s;e of a Liturgy, were all the Di&s;|pute; 'tis you have led me into &s;aying any thing of the Difference between the National <HI>Church</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>I know that the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Primitive Church included the Forms of their Admini&s;trations and Pub|lick Services; and need not recite my Authorities for it to you, who know it better than <HI>I;</HI> nor that they are found in the Time of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and long before him. But I know al&s;o, and the contrary has never been prov'd, that tho&s;e Forms were not impos'd as Terms of Communion, and under the Penalty of Laws, at lea&s;t till the Divi&s;ions of the Church between the <HI>Arrians</HI> and the Orthodox, when Error and Per&s;ecuti|on got into the Church, and the Evil Spirit Reign'd, to the De&s;truction of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I find you no more talking to me till you come to <HI>Page</HI> 25, where you are plea&s;ed to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I believe my &s;elf capable to Defend my Book again&s;t all that the Power of Cavil and Sophi|&s;try
<PB N="281" REF="278">
can &s;ugge&s;t; and therefore I am not &s;ollcitous for my Preface and Title-Page.</P>
<P>But that I may &s;atisfy your Reque&s;t: and telling you fir&s;t, that you oblige me to it: I &s;hall be plain.</P>
<P><HI>You de&s;ire me to examine my own Heart, what I meant by that Sugge&s;tion? in Ca&s;es of Preferment, mentioned in the Title; was it not to in&s;inuate, that Preferment was the inducement to that Worthy Per&s;on to act again&s;t his Con&s;cience?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, Will you be plea&s;ed to <HI>Examine your own Rea|&s;on,</HI> how that can be, when the Words were printed Three Years before the Fact; and I Appeal to God and the World, whether you have not wrongfully Judg'd me then. But to make it more plain:</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay he, or any Body el&s;e does it for Prefer|ment; <HI>you are pleas'd &s;trangely to mi&s;take me:</HI> I &s;ay they may have the Preferment without it.</P>
<P>'Tis done to &s;ave their Money, to &s;ave the Five hun|dred Pounds, which is the Penalty of the Act: I am &s;orry you have not Read the Book before you ventur'd to make &s;o &s;evere a Remark. For your better Infor|mation, therefore, Sir, I refer you to <HI>p.</HI> 19. in the <HI>En|quiry,</HI> where my Words are plain.</P>
<P>As to the Worthy Gentleman, <HI>who&s;e Cau&s;e you would have this to be;</HI> you &s;ay this has been his known Judg|ment and Practice &s;everal Years.</P>
<P>Tho' it were true, yet, Sir, this is no Argument to prove the thing lawful, or to prove that it is not pra|cti&s;ed, even in every part that I have laid down, by others before him, and like to be &s;o after him; it only quits him of doing it again&s;t his Con&s;cience, to q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ell&s;ie him&s;elf for the unprofitable Preferment you mention: <HI>and this I never Charg'd him with.</HI></P>
<P>That he had done the Fact, no Body Di&s;putes, but that he did it again&s;t his Con&s;cience, I never alledg'd; <HI>you put that upon me, Sir, unju&s;tly:</HI> Be his Con&s;cience to God and him&s;elf, I know better than to judge him,
<PB N="282" REF="279">
nor can you without a Breach of Charity &s;ugge&s;t it of me.</P>
<P>Nor do I any-where &s;ay that others have acted a|gain&s;t their Con&s;ciences that do &s;o; po&s;&s;ibly they may by the help of <HI>nice Di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI> Rea&s;on them&s;elves into a Belief of their being in the Right.</P>
<P>But the Point in Debate is, Whether <HI>whatever their Opinions may be in the Ca&s;e,</HI> the Act it &s;elf be not, as I have &s;aid, Circum&s;tantially &s;inful: For I hope you will grant me they are never the more in the Right for its being their Opinion: Truth is always unmov'd, &s;ullen, and the &s;ame, whatever Glo&s;s our Fancy or In|tere&s;t puts upon it.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you will have it be this Gentlemans pra|ctice, which I think no Reputation to him, nor De|fence of the Practice: Nor do I think you or he can ju&s;tifie your Di&s;&s;enting from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and that Practice together: Since, I &s;ay, you will have it be that Gentleman's practice; all you gain by that in point of Argument, is, That he did not do it a|gain&s;t his Con&s;cience, nor to &s;erve the pre&s;ent Turn. And what then? I affirm to you, I neither meant him nor any Man el&s;e, but him that is Guilty; and I meant him, and every Body el&s;e, if they are guilty. And what is all this to the purpo&s;e? The Que&s;tion is not here, Who is, or is not guilty of it; but whether the thing in its own Nature, aggravated with the Circum|&s;tances of Turn and Return, timed for Preferment, with all the black <HI>Et cetera</HI>'s of it, as 'tis lately pra|ctic'd, and as I have laid it down, be a Crime, or no?</P>
<P>If this Gentleman you <HI>would Embroil me with,</HI> did formerly live in a general, or ordinary Communion, both with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and a private Con|gregation, before eit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the Preferments, I mention, invited, or the Penalty of the Law forced him to it; Then he &s;tands clear of this part of the Charge, that he did it for the protection of his Intere&s;t; but &s;till the Matter of Fact is true.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="280">
Thus, Sir, I have &s;aid what I thought my &s;elf ob|lig'd to by way of Reply to your Con&s;iderations: And as to your Cen&s;ures, tho' I have a great Opinion of your Charity, however you &s;eem to be out of Tem|per in this Ca&s;e; yet I appeal from your Judgment, to the Judgment of Truth; and waving all your puzzling Di&s;tinctions, which my Re&s;pect for your Per&s;on and Character, will not permit me to De&s;cant upon; give me leave to make this &s;hort Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Chri&s;tian; the Native Lu&s;tre of an hone&s;t Heart is impo&s;&s;ible to be hid; 'twill &s;hine through all his Life in one Action or ano|ther in &s;pite of Scandal; and it wants no Artifice to &s;et it out.</P>
<P>If the Practice we Di&s;cour&s;e of be to be Defended, <HI>let it be a Practice;</HI> I mean, let it be Voluntary, let it be Free and Spontaneous; and if Gentlemen, who have &s;uch a Latitude in their Opinions, wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by their <HI>Intere&s;ts,</HI> let them practice it openly, and not Time it &s;o to the very <HI>Eve</HI> of an Election, as to have it &s;peak of it &s;elf, and, as it were, force Men to believe it done on pur|po&s;e; nay, let them not put &s;uch a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies, as to have it &s;poken in Con|tempt, with <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> that &s;top the Mouths of Ar|gument, and are as <HI>Convincing</HI> as Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>You have given your Ble&s;&s;ing to them at the <HI>Conclu|&s;ion</HI> of your Book, with a <HI>Let them go on and pro&s;per.</HI> I wi&s;h you have not &s;poken Peace where there is no Peace: As to its being a <HI>Secret between God and Them;</HI> I &s;hall only &s;ay, <HI>Enter not into their Secret, O my Soul!</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Arcana</HI> that is hidden from my Eyes, and I doubt very much how it can con&s;i&s;t with con&s;ulting the Rule with the &s;erious Diligence you recommend: For cer|tainly were the great <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Rule con&s;ulted, it wou'd in&s;truct them, that the Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Religion is not a thing, the Forms whereof are
<PB N="284" REF="281">
of &s;uch indifference, as you &s;eem to make it; that 'tis not a light thing to &s;hift and change <HI>Communion</HI> with an E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and with a Separate <HI>Church,</HI> as often as Convenience, or Rea&s;on of State, or Intere&s;t invite.</P>
<P>And whether I &s;et my Name to this, or no? Whe|ther I am an <HI>Independent? I hope they are Chri&s;tians too as well as other folks.</HI> Whether I am a <HI>Fifth-Monar|chy-man?</HI> Whether the Book was de&s;ign'd again&s;t my Lord Mayor, <HI>tho' 'twas wrote Three Years before he was Cho&s;en?</HI> Or, whether any thing el&s;e you Cen&s;oriou&s;ly charge me with be true, or no, &s;eems to me not worth your while to Examine? Since if I &s;hou'd grant them all, the Argument of Occa&s;ional Conformity remains untouch'd.</P>
<P>If the Truth be made the wor&s;e for my Temper, I am &s;orry for it: But this is another of Mr. <HI>How</HI>'s Paradoxes, <HI>and &s;omething like your &V;nprofitable Prefer|ment,</HI> that Truth, tho' it be mix'd with the wor&s;t Temper in the World, &s;hou'd thereby be &s;o deba&s;ed as to become wor&s;e than Error.</P>
<P>Sir, I had ended here, but for a Clau&s;e you force me to Reply to, concerning the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> who you tax me with abu&s;ing: Indeed 'twas as remote from my Thoughts, as 'twas, that ever it was po&s;&s;ible you cou'd treat an Adver&s;ary with &s;uch Language.</P>
<P>And, but that I &s;hall not &s;uffer my &s;elf to be tran&s;|ported beyond the Bounds of Civility, and &s;o fall into your Error, I cou'd allow my &s;elf to be very much mov'd, That &s;uch a Man as you &s;hould venture to Charge me with what is neither true in Fact, nor can be &s;ugge&s;ted by Con&s;equence from any thing I have wrote: And, Sir, you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, I am &s;orry you &s;hou'd lay your &s;elf &s;o open, and force me to &s;o &s;evere a Remark.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to affirm, That I indu&s;triou&s;ly re|pre&s;ent the Primitive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Puritans, as if they were generally of my <HI>&s;tingy, narrow</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="282">
And here you run upon me with ill Language, <HI>How I could think to Impo&s;e upon the World in a matter of &s;o re|cent Memory;</HI> and, <HI>How I could have the Confidence,</HI> &amp;c. This is really a new &s;ort of Stile from Mr. <HI>How.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, I have indu&s;triou&s;ly examin'd the Book I wrote; and, as I am &s;ure I never entertain'd a Thought in prejudice of the be&s;t Character that can be given tho&s;e Primitive Reformers; &s;o I cannot find one Word in the whole Book which can, no, not with the help of an <HI>Innuendo,</HI> be &s;o much as pretended to look that way.</P>
<P>Wherefore Sir, unle&s;s you can make it out, or, by the help of &s;ome of your Di&s;tinctions, come off from it; I hope you will do me &s;o much Ju&s;tice, as you are a Man of Truth and Hone&s;ty, to recant the Scandal, and acknowledge your &s;elf mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>And that I may leave it to every body to Judge, whether I have not ju&s;t Ground for what I &s;ay; I &s;hall quote here all that I have &s;aid relating to the <HI>Puritans,</HI> and impartially lay down the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>After I had given a &s;hort Abridgment of our Re|formation, and recited the Controver&s;ie between Bi|&s;hop <HI>Ridley</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper,</HI> I proceeded thus, Page the 6th. <HI>When Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>Re&s;tored the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of King</HI> Edward, <HI>ob|tained &s;o on the Minds of Men, that the farther Reformation was rejected: The other Party being not at all Convinc'd, tho' Over-rul'd, &s;ubmitted their Per&s;ons to the Laws, but not their Opinions; affirming, That it was the Duty of every Chri&s;tian to endeavour to &s;erve God with the greate&s;t Purity of Wor&s;hip as was po&s;&s;ible; and that this was the pure&s;t Wor&s;hip which came neare&s;t the Divine In&s;titution, which they believed the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Liturgy did not; and therefore in Con&s;cience they mu&s;t be Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>Having made this Quotation, which I have &s;uffici|ent Authority to prove genuine, from a Manu&s;cript of a famous Man in tho&s;e days, which I have &s;een, and
<PB N="286" REF="283">
on occa&s;ion am ready to produce: I go on thus:</P>
<P><HI>It mu&s;t be own'd, that the Original Authors of the&s;e Di&s;putes were Learned, Devout, and Singularly Pious, &s;trict in Conver&s;ation to Exce&s;s,</HI> if that were po&s;&s;ible; <HI>and from thence in a &s;ort of happy Deri&s;ion, were call'd</HI> Puritans: <HI>Of whom I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but leave for a Record the la&s;t Speech of a famous Foreigner;</HI><Q>Sit anima mea cum Puritanis Anglicanis.</Q></P>
<P>This is all the Words that have the lea&s;t Retro&s;pect on the <HI>Puritans,</HI> unle&s;s you will pretend that a few words, <HI>Page</HI> 24. is meant of them, which no Man can have any Colour of Rea&s;on for: But le&s;t that &s;hou'd be pretended, I &s;hall quote them al&s;o, <HI>Page</HI> 24.</P>
<P><HI>The Di&s;&s;enters can never pretend to be Di&s;&s;enters upon the meer Principle of Purity of Wor&s;hip, as I have related in the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, if &s;uch &s;hall be receiv'd as blamele&s;s into their Communion, who have De&s;erted them upon occa&s;ion of Preferment.</HI></P>
<P>This refers back to <HI>Page</HI> 12. where, I &s;ay, I &s;hall give my E&s;&s;ay as to what I under&s;tand a real Di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tant is, nor can it refer to any other place: But <HI>if you &s;hou'd &s;till &s;ay</HI> it looks back to the <HI>Puritans,</HI> 'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine to find out a Reflecti|on on them in it.</P>
<P>But this is not the only thing in which you are plea|&s;ed to injure both me and the Truth: For, <HI>Page</HI> 28. you tell me with &s;ome Heat too, <HI>That throughout my Book, &s;uch as are &s;o &s;tingily</HI> (your Favourite word, Sir) <HI>bigotted to a Party,</HI> as I, are treated with this &s;ort of Charity, to be &s;til'd <HI>Painted Hypocrites, &s;uch as play Bo|peep with God Almighty, That if &s;uch an Occa&s;ion offer it &s;elf to any of them to &s;erve God and their Country in a publick Station, do what the Law requires, and which they may &s;in|le&s;ly do in order to it, do tre&s;pa&s;s upon their Con&s;ciences, and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> their Souls to &s;ave their Countries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="284">
Sir, <HI>for God-&s;ake,</HI> how came you to let your Pa&s;&s;ion thus out-run your Memory?</P>
<P>There is not one word of all this true: <HI>Pardon me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to &s;ay &s;o: I</HI> refer you to the Criginal to convince your &s;elf of it, and I'll take the pains to go along with you in the Examination.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As to <HI>Painted Hypocrites,</HI> 'tis &s;poken of the whole Body of Prote&s;tants in <HI>England, in haec Verba.</HI></P>
<P>P. 8. <HI>I mu&s;t acknowledge it fares with the Chsrch of</HI> Eng|land, <HI>and with Di&s;&s;enters both, as it has always far'd with Chri&s;ts Church in the whole World; that while &s;uppre&s;s'd and per&s;ecuted, their Profe&s;&s;ors were few, and their Profe&s;&s;ion more &s;evere: But when Religion comes to be the Mode of a Country,</HI> &s;o many Painted Hypocrites, there's the Word, <HI>get into the Church, that Guile is not to be &s;een till it arrive to Apo&s;tacy.</HI></P>
<P>Pray, Sir, who can the&s;e <HI>Painted Hypocrites</HI> refer to, that you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Innuendo, All tho&s;e that are not of my Party, or that are not &s;o &s;tingy as I?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e painted Hypocrites mu&s;t belong to that Re|ligion which is the Mode of the Country: which mu&s;t rather mean the Church of <HI>England</HI> than the Di&s;&s;en|ters: and yet if I meant either of them, it cannot be made a Reflection, becau&s;e 'tis confin'd only to &s;uch as are Apo&s;tates from Religion, not &s;uch as continue to Conform to both or either of them.</P>
<P>This is Judging me indeed neither with <HI>Charity</HI> nor Truth: The next Words are, <HI>Such as play Bo-peep with God Almighty.</HI> Pray, good Sir, reflect on <HI>Solomon,</HI> and what is &s;aid of &s;uch as judge of a Matter before they hear it: I am per&s;waded you did not read the Clau&s;e; which is thus:</P>
<P>I had been Examining the Woful Excu&s;e of &s;ome people, and <HI>too many &s;uch we had,</HI> who wou'd take the Sacrament at the Church, and pretend 'twas done on|ly as a Civil Action; on which I made &s;uch Remarks as, I think, &s;o prophane a Practice de&s;erv'd; and at
<PB N="288" REF="285">
la&s;t added, <HI>This is playing Bo-peep with God Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>And, pray Sir, if I may be &s;o free with you, do but examine the Circum&s;tance as I have laid it down, and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul, if <HI>you are not of the &s;ame Mind.</HI></P>
<P>The other Reflection is on &s;uch, who, tho' it be a|gain&s;t their Con&s;ciences, pretend 'tis to &s;erve their Country: Of the&s;e, I &s;ay, <HI>They are Patriots indeed, who will Damn their Souls to &s;ave their Country:</HI> Not that thereby I imply, that to take the Sacrament with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd Damn any Mans Soul, if he communicated with a right Principle; but to do it to &s;erve a Turn, which is the Que&s;tion in hand, I won't an&s;wer for, tho' it were inverted from the Church to a Di&s;&s;enting Congregation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e In&s;tances, Sir, and more which I could reck|on up, &s;erve to make me admire wherein I have &s;o provok'd you, as to remove you from your wonted Candor: And &s;ince my Writing on a Cau&s;e, which I expected fairer Quarter in, &s;o exceedingly moves you, I &s;hall chu&s;e rather to lay down the Controver&s;y, than to engage with a Per&s;on, who I &s;hou'd be very much concern'd to &s;ee exceed the Rules which he has with &s;o much Succe&s;s, and &s;o much Applau&s;e pre&s;crib'd to others.</P>
<P>I always thought Men might Di&s;pute without Rail|ing, and Differ without Quarrelling; and that Opi|nions need not affect our Tempers: But &s;ince it is not to be found, I leave it to tho&s;e who have a better Talent that way than I.</P>
