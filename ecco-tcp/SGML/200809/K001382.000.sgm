<P>Certainly&mdash;we'll have the wedding to|night.

<P>Ma&s;ter Borachio, learn to re&s;pect a man of &s;cience. I liv'd two years with a Canon of the E&s;tremadura&mdash;the greate&s;t eater in all Portugal; a church-man who did not eat to live, but lived to eat&mdash;he thought of nothing el&s;e, dreamt of nothing el&s;e: I have rode ten miles in a morning to get him a partridge that fed upon green corn, and a black lob&s;ter with the pea in it. What do you think he di&s;charged me for?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had robb'd a Church and committed &s;acriledge, he cou'd not have been more outrageous. He call'd it bla&s;phemy, a crying &s;in again&s;t the fir&s;t elements of cookery. I &s;ee him this moment before me&mdash;his huge paunch blown up like a feather bed, his gouty legs re&s;ting on two down pillows, his eyes
<PB N="35" REF="35">&s;parkling, his mouth watering, the napkin tucked under his ro&s;y gills, and the whole pie devour'd in imagination before he had ta&s;ted a mor&s;el of it: but when it was uncovered, when he &s;aw the eggs&mdash;A&s;s! Blockhead! Villain! (cried he) Eggs in a brown pie! Eggs in a brown pie! out of my &s;ight, and let me never &s;ee thee more.</P>

<P>An Engli&s;h plum pudding! That's a di&s;h I am a &s;tranger to. How do you make it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take a proper quantity of plums and rai&s;ins, &s;pice, marrow and brandy, crumbs of bread and flower; mix them well together; boil it, and &s;o &s;erve it up to table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;oulds like a recipe to an apothecary. I'll try it. The Engli&s;h are a good &s;ort of a rich, proud, melancholy, generous, unrea&s;onable &s;ea-faring &s;ort of people; fight too like their own ma&s;tiffs, and bear taxes as an Elephant does palanquins and rice bags, but I'm not very fond of their cookery.

<P>All wrong, all wrong&mdash;what &s;hou'd be at the top you put at the bottom, and two di&s;hes of pork at the &s;ame &s;ide. It won't do&mdash;it will never do, I tell you.</P>

<P>Yes, and was upon the point of a mo&s;t de&s;perate combat, but your daughter &s;tepp'd in and he ran to her for protection: but I frightened him &s;oundly.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be &s;ome very great, &s;ome extraor|dinary provocation makes me draw, but when once my &s;word is out I'm never tired of fighting: 'tis as natural to me as the cloaths on my back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it. I was the &s;ame my&s;elf when I was young; but what with a little gout and rheumati&s;m in my arms, and better than three &s;core years over my head, my appetite for the duello is &s;omewhat abated, &s;o do you hear, Felix, when your hand's in, if you wou'd frighten Sancho a little for me it wou'd not be ami&s;s. He left me when I &s;aw him la&s;t with a menace, and ever &s;ince I think I have him before my eyes flouri&s;hing a long toledo.</P>

<P>Don Sancho be&s;ides was bred a &s;oldier. Commerce and money dealing have been my bu&s;ine&s;s. To take a man in his own trade is a great di&s;advan|tage.

<P>Then do you con&s;ider how difficult it is to bring an old man up to my years. As to your young people they die, and are born every hour; few of them come to maturity, and no great matter&mdash;but a hale, healthy, &s;tout old man as I am, is invaluable.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This mu&s;t not end &s;o, young gentleman; &s;ervants are under the protection of their ma&s;ters; a blow to the fellow who receives my wages, is an affront to me. You mu&s;t account with me for this.</P>

<P>O unexpected happine&s;s! Art thou indeed my Clara? the &s;ame &s;incere, faithful, generous Clara I knew and loved at Salamanca?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ame, the very &s;ame, except that as you lov'd me when my brother lived, and I had little, I can now reward your di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion with my hand, my heart, and an e&s;tate large enough to gratify all our wi&s;hes, and to relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of all who may want our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>Very true, Madam; I &s;erved you both to the be&s;t of my power, but as you were to be man and wife, 'tis not &s;trange you know, that I &s;hou'd not always be able to obey one without offending the other.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I take the liberty of offering my poor congratulations on this joyful occa&s;ion? Will you believe it, Sir, I had a &s;ort of an inkling, a divining, that &s;omething of this kind would happen; for I dreamt all la&s;t night of cats and dogs and a &s;pread eagle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your dreams I hope go by contraries; and you &s;hall be a witne&s;s of our harmony, for I intend to keep you in my &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be bold to &s;ay, Sir, you never took a wi&s;er re&s;olution. Mercy on me, Sir, you don't know half I can do to &s;erve you. I was Major Domo to the fir&s;t Grandee of Arragon, he was call'd Don Guzman Podero&s;o, y Chilos, y Figureroz, y Palidos, y Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dos, y Dumpos: he was a great man, Sir, and had a great many names.</P>

<P>So I perceive.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He lo&s;t his only daughter, a mo&s;t beauti|ful young Lady, who broke her heart for the death of her lover, and a favourite Squirrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very &s;u&s;ceptible Lady, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, very &s;urreptible. A certain Duke, a particular friend of my ma&s;ter's, came to condole with him (for poor Grandee, he was quite uncomfortable) and &s;pying me wiping my eyes in an
<PB REF="46">outward room, with a Barcelona handkerchief, as he was taking leave of my ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, Don Dumpos, I am &s;orry for your misfortune, but be of good heart, pray be comforted, if you had lo&s;t your wife as well as your daughter, I &s;hould hardly know how to pity you, while you po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a trea&s;ure in a &s;ervant as the incomparable Lazarillo.</P>

<STAGE>(To Clara)</STAGE>
<P>Madam, your ingenuity has had already &s;uch ample revenge for the rude language I u&s;ed to you, that I hardly know how to offer an apo|logy for the effects of my mi&s;taken anger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid if any apology were nece&s;&s;ary, I ought to make it, for I was certainly the offender; but all unkindne&s;s mu&s;t give way hereafter to e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
