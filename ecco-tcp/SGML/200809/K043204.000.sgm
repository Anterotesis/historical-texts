<P>LOVE'S FRAILTIES: A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS, AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<P>THOSE pa&s;&s;ages that are printed in <HI>Italics</HI> (not in|cluding the French) were omitted on the fir&s;t repre|&s;entation, one excepted, page 66, of which the words that then gave offence are di&s;tingui&s;hed by capitals. They are thus pointed out that the reader, who in the heat of political zeal has not quite lo&s;t his under&s;tanding, may examine what there is in them injurious to truth, or the good of mankind, and find it, if he can. In different times and under different feelings, it will appear a&s;toni&s;h|ing that any one of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, from any apprehen&s;ion of political re&s;entment: but &s;uch was the fact. That the one unwarily retained &s;hould excite the anger which was te&s;tified is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing. A &s;entence &s;o true as to have been repeated in a thou&s;and different modes: for all &s;trong moral truths are &s;ubject to &s;uch repetition. A &s;entence that, under a variety of forms and phra&s;eology, is proverbial in all nations. It ought however to be remembered, that the per&s;ons offended, though violent, were few. Their intention doubtle&s;s was good: the &s;ame cannot be affirmed of their intellect.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with German literature, and who have read the drama entitled, <HI>Der Deut&s;che Hau&s;vater,</HI> by the Baron von Gemmingen, will immediately perceive that the author has availed him&s;elf of various incidents and thoughts in that piece; though his fable, characters, and denouement are exceedingly different. Others, who wi&s;h to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity but who cannot read Ger|man, may find a French tran&s;lation of that piece in vo|lume VI. of a work entitled <HI>Nouveau Theatre Allemand,</HI> by M. M. Friedel and de Bonneville.</P>

<P>THE rea&s;ons which have occa&s;ioned the alteration of price in the pre&s;ent comedy ought to be &s;tated to the public. The previous knowledge of men and manners, and the extraordinary efforts of &s;tudy, time, and talents, which are nece&s;&s;ary to produce a play that has but a chance of being &s;anctioned by the town, are &s;ufficiently obvious. The labourer is worthy of his hire. In the be|ginning of the pre&s;ent century, the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence. Since that period, the price of pa|per has been doubled; the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the &s;ame ratio; and adverti&s;ing, which now amounts to a con&s;iderable &s;um, was then a burthen un|known. It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purcha&s;e of the copy-right, added to the above co&s;ts, occa&s;ioned plays to be a dangerous &s;peculation. The new tax on paper, in addition to all the&s;e, has made it impo&s;&s;i|ble, at the former price, to reward authors, and afford the book&s;eller a rea&s;onable hope of profit. The&s;e con&s;i|derations have induced an advance of price, at which it is pre&s;umed no ju&s;t rea&s;oner will take offence.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pennyle&s;s: a lieutenant in a marching regiment.</P>

<P>Thus we lovers rave. The world con|tains but one!</P>

<P>Where is there another Paulina? Encum|bered by the ab&s;urdities of folly, di&s;gui&s;ed by the

ridiculous trappings of fa&s;hion, where &s;hall the &s;in|cere, the &s;imple, the affectionate heart be found?

<P>Ah, Charles, you forget our depen|dent &s;ituation; our family.</P>

<P>Our fools and tyrants. An elder brother, who&s;e rank wealth and power, in&s;tead of afford|ing us protection, have been made the pa&s;&s;ports of folly and vice; and an uncle, who&s;e benevolence is &s;elf love; who has given us &s;helter only to make us &s;laves; at once a cynic and a &s;en&s;uali&s;t; &s;evere to others, indulgent to him&s;elf; arbitrary in prin|ciple, libidinous in practice.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think the men of former ages were guilty of as great vices as tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Craig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keep your mouth&punc; &s;hut&mdash;Greater: but they did not make a &s;y&s;tem of vice; they were hurried into it by their pa&s;&s;ions. Theirs were the crimes of men. There is a di&s;graceful a contempti|ble meanne&s;s in the vices, as well as the per&s;ons of
<PB N="62" REF="69">
the pre&s;ent puny race; and neither their pa&s;&s;ions nor their bodies have &s;ufficient prowe&s;s to make them commit acts, that can entitle them to re|&s;pect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Ri&s;es with animation)</STAGE> If they fight a duel, it is not in the heat of anger, and de&s;ire of revenge; but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet, or &s;ip a di&s;h of tea: ay and as little danger, too; for, as they manage the matter, there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and &s;teel.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why as to the merit, or virtue, of fight|ing duels, either in the old mode or the new, I believe we had better not talk of that.</P>
