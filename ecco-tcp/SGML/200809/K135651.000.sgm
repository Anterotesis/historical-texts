<HEAD>A PREFATORY ADDRESS TO THE LADIES, &amp;c. of GREAT BRITAIN and IRELAND, IN BEHALF OF THE FRENCH EMIGRANT CLERGY.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be allowed that there may ari&s;e occa|&s;ions &s;o extraordinary, that all the le&s;&s;er motives of delicacy ought to vani&s;h before them; it is pre&s;umed that the pre&s;ent emergency will in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;ti|fy the hardine&s;s of an Addre&s;s from a private individ|ual, who, &s;timulated by the urgency of the ca&s;e, &s;a|crifices inferior con&s;iderations to the ardent de&s;ire of rai&s;ing further &s;upplies towards relieving a di&s;tre&s;s as pre&s;&s;ing as it is unexampled.</P>
<P>We are informed by public adverti&s;ement, that the large &s;ums already &s;o liberally &s;ub&s;cribed for the Emigrant Clergy, are almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. Authentic information adds, that multitudes of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Exiles in the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, are on the point of wanting bread.</P>
<P>Very many to whom this addre&s;s is made have al|ready contributed. O let them not be weary in well-doing! Many are making generous exertions for
<PB N="4" REF="3">
the ju&s;t and natural claims of the widows and chil|dren of our brave &s;eamen and &s;oldiers. Let it not be &s;aid, that the pre&s;ent is an <HI>interfering</HI> claim. Tho&s;e to whom I write, have bread enough, and to &s;pare. You, who fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, and yet com|plain you have little to be&s;tow, let not this bounty be &s;ubtracted from another bounty, but rather from &s;ome &s;uperfluous expen&s;e.</P>
<P>The beneficent and right minded want no arguments to be pre&s;&s;ed upon them; but I write to tho&s;e of eve|ry de&s;cription. Luxurious habits of living, which really furni&s;h the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the faire&s;t grounds for application, are too often urged as a motive for withholding a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and produced as a plea for having little to &s;pare. Let her who indulges &s;uch habits, and pleads &s;uch excu&s;es in con&s;equence, re|flect, that by retrenching <HI>one</HI> co&s;tly di&s;h from her abundant table, the &s;uperfluities of <HI>one</HI> expen&s;ive de|&s;ert, <HI>one</HI> evening's public amu&s;ement, &s;he may furni&s;h at lea&s;t a week's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to more than one per&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mc. Bowdler's letter &s;tates, that about Six Shillings a week included the expen&s;es of each Prie&s;t at Winche&s;ter.</NOTE> as liberally bred perhaps as her&s;elf, and who, in his own country, may have often ta&s;ted how much more ble&s;&s;ed it is to give than to receive&mdash;to a mini&s;ter of God, who has been long accu&s;tomed to be&s;tow the nece&s;&s;aries he is now reduced to &s;olicit.</P>
<P>Even your young daughters, whom maternal pru|dence has not yet furni&s;hed with the means of be&s;towing, may be cheaply taught the fir&s;t rudiments of charity, together with an important le&s;&s;on of economy: They may be taught to &s;acrifice a feather, a &s;et of ribbons, an expen&s;ive ornament, an idle diver&s;ion. And if they are thus in&s;tructed, that there is no true charity without &s;elf denial, they will <HI>gain</HI> more than they are called upon to <HI>give:</HI> For the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of one luxu|ry for a charitable purpo&s;e, is the exerci&s;e of two vir|tues, and this without any pecuniary expen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
Let the &s;ick and afflicted remember how dreadful it mu&s;t be, to be expo&s;ed to &s;ufferings, without one of the alleviations which mitigate <HI>their</HI> affliction. How dreadful it is to be without comforts, without nece&s;&s;a|ries, without a home&mdash;<HI>without a country!</HI> While the gay and pro&s;perious would do well to recollect, how &s;uddenly and terribly tho&s;e for whom we plead, were, by the &s;urpri&s;ing vici&s;&s;itudes of life, thrown from equal heights of gaiety and pro&s;perity. And let tho&s;e who have hu&s;bands, fathers, &s;ons, brothers, or friends, re|flect on the uncertainties of war, and the revolution of human affairs. It is only by imagining the po&s;&s;ibil|ity of tho&s;e who are dear to us being placed in the &s;ame calamitous circum&s;tances, that we can obtain an adequate feeling of the woes we are called upon to commi&s;erate.</P>
<P>In a di&s;tre&s;s &s;o wide and comprehen&s;ive, many are prevented from giving by that common excu&s;e&mdash; "That it is but a drop of water in the ocean." But let them reflect, that if all the individual drops were withheld, there would be no ocean at all; and the in|ability to give much ought not, on any occa&s;ion, to be converted into an excu&s;e for giving nothing. Even moderate circum&s;tances need not plead an exemption. The indu&s;trious trade&s;man will not, even in a political view, be eventually a lo&s;er by his &s;mall contribution. The money rai&s;ed is neither carried out of our coun|try, nor di&s;&s;ipated in luxuries, but returns again to the community; to our &s;hops and to our markets, to pro|cure the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>Some have objected to the difference of <HI>religion</HI> of tho&s;e for whom we &s;olicit. Such an objection hardly de&s;erves a &s;erious an&s;wer. Surely if the &s;uper&s;titious Tartar hopes to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the courage and talents of the enemy he &s;lays, the Chri&s;tian is not a|fraid of catching, or of propagating the error of the &s;ufferer he relieves.&mdash;Chri&s;tian charity is of no party. We plead not for their faith, but for their wants. And let the more &s;crupulous, who look for de&s;ert as well as
<PB N="6" REF="5">
di&s;tre&s;s in the objects of their bounty, bear in mind, that if the&s;e men could have &s;acrificed their con&s;cience to their convenience, they had not now been in this country. Let us &s;hew them the purity of <HI>our</HI> religion, by the beneficence of our actions.</P>
<P>If you will permit me to pre&s;s upon you &s;uch high motives (and it were to be wi&s;hed that in every action we were to be influenced by the highe&s;t) perhaps no act of bounty to which, you may be called out, can ever come &s;o immediately under that &s;olemn and af|fecting de&s;cription, which will be recorded in the great day of account&mdash;<HI>I was a &s;tranger and ye took me in.&mdash;</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE following is an exact Tran&s;lation from a <HI>SPEECH</HI> made in the National Convention at Paris, on Friday the 14th of December <HI>1792,</HI> in a Debate on the Subject of e&s;tabli&s;hing Public Schools for the Education of Youth, by Citizen <HI>DUPONT,</HI> a Member of con&s;iderable Weight; and as the Doctrines contained in it were re|ceived with unanimous Applau&s;e, except from two or three of the Clergy, it may be fairly con&s;idered as an Expo&s;ition of the Creed of that Enlightened A&s;&s;embly. Tran&s;lated from <HI>Le Moniteur</HI> of Sunday the 16th of December, 1792.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT! Thrones are overturned! Scep|tres broken! Kings expire! And yet the Altars of GOD remain! (Here there is a murmur from &s;ome Members; and the Abb&eacute; ICHON demands that the per&s;on &s;peaking may be called to order.) Tyrants, in outrage to nature, continue to burn an impious in|cen&s;e on tho&s;e Altars! (Some murmurs ari&s;e, but they are lo&s;t in the applau&s;es from the majority of the A&s;&s;embly.) The Thrones that have been rever&s;ed, have left the&s;e Altars naked, un&s;upported, and totter|ing. A &s;ingle breath of enlightened rea&s;on will now be &s;ufficient to make them di&s;appear; and if humani|ty is under obligations to the French nation for the fir&s;t of the&s;e benefits, the fall of Kings, can it be doubted but that the French people, now &s;overeign, will be wi&s;e enough, in like manner, to overthrow tho&s;e Altars and <HI>tho&s;e Idols</HI> to which tho&s;e Kings have hitherto made them &s;ubject? <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="7">
ought to be the gods of men! The&s;e are my gods! (Here the Abb&eacute; AUDREIN cried out, "There is no bearing this;" and ru&s;hed out of the A&s;&s;embly.&mdash; A great laugh.) Admire <HI>nature</HI>&mdash;cultivate <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> And you, Legi&s;lators, if you de&s;ire that the French people &s;hould be happy, make ha&s;te to propagate the&s;e princi|ples, and to teach them in your primary &s;chools, in&s;tead of tho&s;e fanatical principles which have hitherto been taught. The tyranny of Kings was confined to make their people mi&s;erable in this life&mdash;but tho&s;e other ty|rants, the Prie&s;ts, extend their dominion into another, of which they have no other idea than of eternal pun|i&s;hments; a doctrine which &s;ome men have hitherto had the good nature to believe. But the moment of the cata&s;trophe is come&mdash;all the&s;e prejudices mu&s;t fall at the &s;ame time. <HI>We mu&s;t de&s;troy them, or they will de&s;troy us.</HI>&mdash;For my&s;elf, I hone&s;tly avow to tile Conven|tion, <HI>I am an athei&s;t!</HI> (Here there is &s;ome noi&s;e and tumult. But a great number of members cry out, "What is that to us&mdash;you are an hone&s;t man!") But I defy a &s;ingle individual, among the twenty-four millions of Frenchmen, to make again&s;t me any well grounded reproach. I doubt whether the Chri&s;tians, or the Catholics, of which the la&s;t &s;peaker, and tho&s;e of his opinion, have been talking to us, can make the &s;ame challenge.&mdash;(Great applau&s;es.) There is ano|ther con&s;ideration&mdash;Paris has had great lo&s;&s;es. It has been deprived of the commerce of luxury; of that factitious &s;plendour which was found at courts, and invited &s;trangers hither. Well! We mu&s;t repair the&s;e lo&s;&s;es.&mdash;Let me then repre&s;ent to you the times, that are fa&s;t approaching, when our philo&s;ophers, who&s;e names are celebrated throughout Europe, PETION, SYEYES, CONDORCET, and others&mdash;&s;urrounded in our Pantheon, as the Greek philo&s;ophers where at Athens, with a crowd of di&s;ciples coming from all parts of Eu|rope, walking like the Peripatetics, and teaching&mdash;this man, the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and developing the progre&s;s of all human knowledge; that, perfectioning

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE SPEECH of Mr. DUPONT, ON THE SUBJECTS OF Religion and Public Education.</HEAD>
<P>IT is pre&s;umed that it may not be thought un|&s;ea&s;onable at this critical time to offer to the Public, and e&s;pecially to the more religious part of it, a few &s;light ob&s;ervations, occa&s;ioned by the late famous Speech of Mr. Dupont, which exhibits the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith of a con&s;iderable Member of the French Na|tional Convention. Though the Speech it&s;elf has been pretty generally read, yet it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to perfix it to the&s;e Remarks, left &s;uch as have not al|ready peru&s;ed it, might, from an hone&s;t reluctance to credit the exi&s;tence of &s;uch principles, di&s;pute its au|thenticity, and accu&s;e the remarks, if unaccompanied by the Speech, of a &s;pirit of invective and unfair ex|aggeration. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that its impiety is &s;o mon&s;trous, that many good men were of opinion it ought not to be made familiar to the minds of Engli&s;hmen; for there are crimes with which even the imagination &s;hould never come in contact.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
But as an ancient nation intoxicated their &s;laves, and then expo&s;ed them before their children, in order to increa&s;e their horror of intemperance; &s;o it is hop|ed that this piece of impiety may be placed in &s;uch a light before the eyes of the Chri&s;tian reader, that, in proportion as his dete&s;tation is rai&s;ed, his faith, in&s;tead of being &s;haken, will be only &s;o much the more &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>This celebrated Speech, though, delivered in an a&s;|&s;embly of Politicians, is not on a que&s;tion of politics, but on one as &s;uperior as the &s;oul is to the body, and eternity to time. The object here, is not to dethrone kings, but HIM by whom kings reign. It does not here excite the cry of indignation that <HI>Louis</HI> reigns, but that <HI>the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this the declaration of &s;ome ob&s;cure and a|nonymons per&s;on, but an expo&s;ition of the Creed of a public Leader. It is not a &s;entiment hinted in a jour|nal, hazarded in a pamphlet, or thrown out at a dis|puting club; but it is the implied faith of the rulers of a great nation.</P>
<P>Little notice would have been due to this famous Speech, if it had conveyed the &s;entiments of only <HI>one</HI> vain orator; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that it was heard, received, <HI>applauded,</HI> with two or three excep|tions only&mdash;a fact, which you, who have &s;carcely be|lieved in the exi&s;tence of athei&s;m, will hardly credit, and which, for the honour of the eighteenth century, it is hoped that our po&s;terity, being &s;till more unac|quainted with &s;uch corrupt opinions, will reject as to|tally incredible.</P>
<P>A love of liberty, generous in its principle, inclines &s;ome good men &s;till to favour the proceedings of the National Convention of France. They do not yet per|ceive that the licentious wildne&s;s which has been excit|ed in that country, is de&s;tructive of all true happine&s;s, and no more re&s;emble liberty, than the tumultuous joys of the drunkard, re&s;emble the cheerfulne&s;s of a &s;ober and well regulated mind.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
To tho&s;e who do not know of what &s;trange incon&s;i&s;t|ences man is made up; who have not con&s;idered how &s;ome per&s;ons, having at fir&s;t been ha&s;tily and heed|le&s;sly drawn in as approvers, by a &s;ort of natural pro|gre&s;&s;ion, &s;oon become principals;&mdash;to tho&s;e who have never ob&s;erved by what a variety of &s;trange a&s;&s;ocia|tions in the mind, opinions that &s;eem the mo&s;t irrecon|cileable meet at &s;ome un&s;u&s;pected turning, and come to be united in the &s;ame man;&mdash;to all &s;uch it may appear quite incredible, that well meaning and even pious people &s;hould continue to applaud the principles of a &s;et of men who have publicly made known their intention of aboli&s;hing Chri&s;tianity, as far as the de|molition of altars, prie&s;ts, temples, and institutions, <HI>can</HI> aboli&s;h it; and as to the religion it&s;elf, this al&s;o they may traduce, and for their own part reject, but we know, from the comfortable promi&s;e of an authority &s;till &s;acred in this country, at lea&s;t, that <HI>the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>Let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood by tho&s;e to whom the&s;e &s;light remarks are principally addre&s;&s;ed; that cla&s;s of well intentioned people, who favour at lea&s;t, if they do not adopt, the prevailing &s;entiments of the new Republic. You are not here accu&s;ed of being the wilful abetters of in&s;idelity. God forbid! <Q>we are per&s;uaded better things of you, and things which accompany &s;alvation.</Q> But this <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of li|berty and univer&s;al brotherhood, which the French are madly pur&s;uing, with the in&s;ignia of freedom in one hand, and the bloody bayonet in the other, has bewitched your &s;en&s;es, and is in danger of mi&s;leading your &s;teps. You are gazing at a meteor rai&s;ed by the vapours of vanity, which the&s;e wild and in&s;atuat|ed wanderers are pur&s;uing to their de&s;truction; and though for a moment you mi&s;take it for a heaven-born light, which leads to the perfection of human free|dom, you will, &s;hould you join in the mad pur&s;uit, &s;oon di&s;cover that it will conduct you over dreary wilds and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
&s;inking bogs, only to plunge yon in deep and inevi|table ruin.</P>
<P>Much, very much is to be &s;aid in vindication of your favouring in the fir&s;t in&s;tance their political pro|jects. The cau&s;e they look in hand &s;eemed to be the great cau&s;e of human kind. Its very name in&s;ured its popularity. What Engli&s;h heart did not exult at the demolition of the Ba&s;tile? What lover of his &s;pecies did not triumph in the warm hope, that one of the fine&s;t countries in the world would &s;oon be one of the mo&s;t free? Popery and de&s;poti&s;m, though chained by the gentle influence of Louis XVIth, had actually &s;lain their thou&s;ands. Little was it then imagined, that anarchy and athei&s;m, the mon&s;ters who were about to &s;ucceed them, would &s;oon &s;tay their ten thou&s;ands. If we cannot regret the defeat of the two former ty|rants, what mu&s;t they be who can triumph in the mi&s;chiefs of the two latter? Who, I &s;ay, that had a head to rea&s;on, or a heart to feel, did not glow with hope, that from the ruin's of tyranny, and the rubbi&s;h of popery, a beautiful and finely framed edifice would in time have been con&s;tructed, and that ours would not have been the only country in which the patriot's fair idea of well under&s;tood liberty, and of the mo&s;t pure and rea&s;onable, as well as the mo&s;t &s;ublime and exalted Chri&s;tianity might be realized?</P>
<P>But, alas! it frequently happens that he wi&s;e and good are not the mo&s;t adventurous in attacking the mi&s;chiefs which they perceive and lament. With a ti|midity in &s;ome re&s;pects virtuous, they fear attempting any thing which may po&s;&s;ible aggravate the evils they deplore, or put to hazard the ble&s;&s;ings they al|ready enjoy. They dread plucking up the wheat with the tares, and are rather apt, with a &s;pirit of hopele&s;s re&s;ignation,
<Q><L>To bear the ills they have,</L>
<L>Than fly to others that they know not of.</L></Q></P>
<P>While &s;ober minded and con&s;iderate men, there|fore, &s;at mourning over this complicated ma&s;s of er|ror,

and waited till God, in his own good time, &s;hould open the blind eyes; the va&s;t &s;cheme of reformation was left to that &s;et of ra&s;h and pre&s;umptuous adven|turers, who are generally watching how they may con|vert public grievances to their own per&s;onal account. It was undertaken, not upon the broad ba&s;is of a wi&s;e and well dige&s;ted &s;cheme, of which all the parts &s;hould contribute to the perfection of one con&s;i&s;tent whole: It was carried on, not by tho&s;e &s;teady mea|&s;ures, founded on rational deliberation, which are calculated to accompli&s;h &s;o important an end; not with a temperance which indicated a &s;ober love of law, or a &s;acred regard for religion; but with the mo&s;t extravagant lu&s;t of power, and the mo&s;t inor|dinate vanity which perhaps ever in&s;tigated human mea&s;ures; a lu&s;t of power which threatens to extend its de&s;olating influence over the whole globe; a van|ity of the &s;ame de&s;tructive &s;pecies with that which &s;tim|ulated the celebrated incendiary of Ephe&s;us, who being weary of his native ob&s;curity and in&s;ignificance, and prefering infamy to oblivion, could contrive no other road to fame and immortality, than that of letting fire to the exqui&s;ite Temple of Diana. He was remem|bered indeed, as he de&s;ired to be, but only to be exe|crated; while the &s;eventh wonder of the world lay pro&s;trate through his crime.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame over ruling vanity which operates in their politics, and in their religion, which makes Ker&s;aint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Speech, enumerating their: intended projects.</NOTE> boa&s;t of carrying his de&s;tructive projects from the Tagus to the Brazils, and from Mexico to the &s;hores of the Ganges; which makes him menace to out&s;trip the enterpri&s;es of the mo&s;t extravagant hero of romance, and almo&s;t undertake with the mar|velous celerity of the nimbly footed Puck,
<Q><L>To put a girdle round about the earth</L>
<L>In forty minutes.</L></Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame vanity, &s;till the ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion in the bo&s;om of a Frenchman, which leads Dupont and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Manuel to undertake in their orations to aboli&s;h the Sabbath, exterminate the Prie&s;thood, erect a Panthe|on for the World, re&s;tore the Peripatetic Philo&s;ophy, and in &s;hort revive every thing of ancient Greece, ex|cept the pure ta&s;te, the wi&s;dom, the love of virtue, the veneration of the laws, and that degree of reve|rence which even virtuous Pagans profe&s;&s;ed for the Deity.</P>
<P>It is &s;urely to be charged to the inadequate and wretched hands into which the work of reformation fell, and not to the impo&s;&s;ibility of amending the civ|il and religious in&s;titutions of France, that all has &s;uc|ceeded &s;o ill. It cannot be denied, perhaps, that a reforming &s;pirit was wanted in that country; their government was not more de&s;potic, than their church was &s;uper&s;titious and corrupt.</P>
<P>But though this is readily granted, and though it may he unfair to blame tho&s;e who in the <HI>fir&s;t out&s;et</HI> of the French Revolution, rejoiced even on religious motives; yet it is a&s;toni&s;hing, how any pious per|&s;on, even with all the blinding power of prejudice, can think without horror of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of France. It is no le&s;s wonderful how any rational man could, even in the beginning of the Revolution, transfer that rea&s;oning, however ju&s;t it might be, when appli|ed to France, to the ca&s;e of England. For what can be more unrea&s;onable, than to draw from different, and even oppo&s;ite premi&s;es, the &s;ame conclu&s;ion? Mu&s;t a revolution be equally nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e of two &s;orts of Government, and two &s;orts of Religion, which are the very rever&s;e of each other? oppo&s;ite in their genius, unlike in their fundamental principles, and widely different in each of their component parts.</P>
<P>That de&s;poti&s;m, prie&s;tcraft, intolerance, and &s;uper|&s;tition, are terrible evils, no candid Chri&s;tian it is pre&s;umed will deny; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, though the&s;e mi&s;chiefs are not yet entirely bani&s;hed from the face of the earth, they have &s;carcely any exi&s;tence in this country.</P>

To guard again&s;t a real danger, and to cure a final abu&s;es, of which the exi&s;tence has been fir&s;t plainly proved, by the application of a &s;uitable remedy, re|quires diligence as well as courage; ob&s;ervation as well as genius; patience and temperance as well as zeal and &s;pirit. It requires the union of that clear head and found heart which con&s;titute the true patri|ot. But to conjure up fancied evils, or even greatly to aggravate real ones, and then to exhau&s;t our la|bour in combating them, is, the characteri&s;tic of a di&s;|tempered imagination and an ungoverned &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Romantic cru&s;ades, the ordeal trial, drowning of witches, the torture, and the Inqui&s;ition, have been ju&s;tly reprobated as the &s;oule&s;t &s;tain of the re&s;pective periods, in which, to the di&s;grace of human rea&s;on, they exi&s;ted; but would any man be rationally em|ployed, who &s;hould now &s;tand up gravely to declaim again&s;t the&s;e as the predominating mi&s;chiefs of the pre&s;ent century? Even the whim&s;ical Knight of La Mancha him&s;elf, would not fight wind mills that were pulled down; yet I will venture to &s;ay, that the a|bove named evils are at pre&s;ent little more chimerical than &s;ome of tho&s;e now fo bitterly complained of a|mong us. It is not, as Dryden &s;aid, when one of his works was unmercifully abu&s;ed, that the piece has not faults enough in it, but the critics have not had the wit to fix upon the right ones.</P>
<P>It is allowed that, as a nation, we have faults enough, but our political critics err in the objects of their cen&s;ure. They &s;ay little of tho&s;e real and pre&s;&s;|ing evils re&s;ulting from our own corruption, which con&s;titute the actual mi&s;eries of life; while they gloomily &s;peculate upon a thou&s;and imaginary po|litical grievances, and fancy that the reformation of our rulers and our legi&s;lators is all that is wanting to make us a happy people.</P>

religion was never laid more open to all, than at this day. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay we were a religious people; but this at lea&s;t may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that the great truths of religion were never better under|&s;tood; that Chri&s;tianity was never more completely &s;tripped from all its incumbrances and di&s;gui&s;es, or more thoroughly purged from human infu&s;ions, and whatever is deba&s;ing in human in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Let us in this yet happy country, learn at lea&s;t one great and important truth, from the errors of this di&s;|tracted people. Their conduct has awfully illu&s;trated a po&s;ition, which is not the le&s;s found for having been often controverted, That no degree of wit and learn|ing; no progre&s;s in commerce; no advances in the knowledge of nature, or in the embelli&s;hments of art, can ever thoroughly tame that &s;avage, the natural human heart, without RELIGION. The arts of &s;ocial life may give a &s;weetne&s;s to the manners and lan|guage, and induce, in &s;ome degree, a love of ju&s;tice, truth, and humanity; but attainments derived from &s;uch inferior cau&s;es are no more than the &s;emblance and the &s;hadow of the qualities derived from pure, Chri&s;tianity. Varni&s;h is an extraneous ornament, but true poli&s;h is a proof of the &s;olidity of the body; it depends greatly on the nature of the &s;ub&s;tance, is not &s;uperinduced by accidental cau&s;es, but in a good mea&s;ure proceeding from internal foundne&s;s.</P>
<P>The poets of that country, who&s;e &s;tyle, &s;entiments, manners, and religion the French &s;o affectedly labour to imitate, have left keen and biting fatires on the Roman vices. Again&s;t the late proceedings in France, no fatiri&s;t need employ his pen; that of the hi&s;torian will be quite &s;ufficient. Fact will put fable out of countenance; and the crimes which are u&s;u|ally held up to our abhorrence in works of invention, will be regarded as flat and feeble by tho&s;e who &s;hall peru&s;e the records of the tenth of Augu&s;t, of the &s;econd and third of September, and of lie twenty fir&s;t of January.</P>

Where &s;o much is at &s;take, they will do well to keep their con|&s;ciences tender, in order to which they &s;hould try to keep their di&s;cernment acute. They will do well to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of innovation is bu&s;ily operating under various, though &s;eemingly un|connected forms. To ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame impa|tience of re&s;traint, the &s;ame contempt of order, peace, and &s;ubordination, which makes men bad citizens, makes them bad Chri&s;tians; and that to this &s;ecret, but almo&s;t infallible connexion between religious and political &s;entiment, does France owe her pre&s;ent un|paralleled anarchy and impiety.</P>

The&s;e, together with tho&s;e con&s;ci|entious exiles whom this nation &s;o honourably pro|tects, may yet live to rejoice in the re&s;toration of true liberty and &s;olid peace to their native country, when light and order &s;hall &s;pring from the pre&s;ent darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion, and the reign of chaos &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>May I be permitted a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ub|ject of tho&s;e exiles? It &s;hall only be to remark, that all the boa&s;ted conque&s;ts of our Edwards and our Henrys over the French nation, do not confer &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial glory on our own country, as the derives from having received, protected, and &s;upported, a|mong multitudes of other &s;ufferers, at a time and un|der circum&s;tances &s;o peculiarly di&s;advantageous to her&s;elf, <HI>three thou&s;and prie&s;ts,</HI> of a nation habitually her enemy, and of a religion intolerant and ho&s;tile to her own. This is the &s;olid triumph of true Chri&s;tianity; and it is worth remarking, that the deeds which poets and hi&s;torians celebrate as rare and &s;plendid actions, and &s;ublime in&s;tances of greatne&s;s of &s;oul, in the he|roes of the Pagan world, are but the ordinary and habitual virtues which occur in the common cour&s;e of action among Chri&s;tians; quietly performed with|out effort or exertion, and with no view to renown; but re&s;ulting naturally and nece&s;&s;arily from the reli|gion they profe&s;s.</P>
<P>So predominating is the power of an example we cave once admired, and &s;et up as a &s;tandard of imita|tion, and &s;o fa&s;cinating has been the a&s;cendency of the Convention over the minds of tho&s;e who&s;e approba|tion of French politics commenced in the earlier peri|ods of the Revolution, that it extends to the mo&s;t triv|ial circum&s;tances.
