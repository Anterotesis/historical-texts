<L>When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,</L>

<L>But whil&s;t the&s;e generous rivals fought and fell,</L>
<L>The&s;e generous rivals lov'd each other well:</L>
<L>Tho' many a bloody field was lo&s;t and won,</L>
<L>Nothing in hate, in honour all was done.</L>
<L>When <HI>PIERCY</HI> wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers,</L>
<L>Fa&s;t came the <HI>DOUGLAS,</HI> with his <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> &s;pears;</L>

<L>Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM:</L>
<L>Strong was his rage, eternal his re&s;entment:</L>

<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! rake not up the a&s;hes of my fathers:</L>

<L><PB N="3" REF="8">Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallant lives</L>

<L>War I dete&s;t: but war with foreign foes,</L>

<L>As that which with our neighbours oft we wage.</L>
<L>A river here, there an ideal line</L>

<L>On each &s;ide dwells a people &s;imilar,</L>

<L>But with each other fight in cruel conflict.</L>
<L>Gallant in &s;trife, and noble in their ire,</L>
<L>The battle is their pa&s;time. They go forth</L>
<L>Gay in the morning, as to &s;ummer &s;port:</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! an ancient feud,</L>

<L>The life of DOUGLAS' &s;on, our hou&s;e's foe:</L>
<L>The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friend&s;hip.</L>

<L>Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was call'd</L>
<L>To fight his father's battles; and with him,</L>
<L>In &s;pite of all my tears, did MALCOLM go.</L>
<L>Scarce were they gone, when my &s;tern &s;ire was told</L>
<L>That the fal&s;e &s;tranger was lord DOUGLAS' &s;on.</L>
<L>Frantic with rage, the baron drew his &s;word</L>

<L>In the fir&s;t days</L>

<L>Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutour,</L>

<L>Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,</L>
<L>Like a guilt-troubl'd gho&s;t, my painful rounds:</L>
<L>Nor has de&s;piteful fate permitted me</L>

<L>Domains, that &s;hould to DOUGLAS' &s;on have giv'n</L>
<L>A baron's title, and a baron's power.</L>
<L>Such were my foothing thoughts, while I bewail'd</L>
<L>The &s;laughter'd father of a &s;on unborn.</L>
<L>And when that &s;on came, like a ray from heav'n,</L>
<L>Which &s;hines and di&s;appears; alas! my child!</L>

<L>This moon which ro&s;e la&s;t night, round as my &s;hield,</L>

<L>Ru&s;h'd like a torrent down upon the vale,</L>
<L>Sweeping our flocks and herds. The &s;hepherds fled</L>
<L>For &s;afety, and for &s;uccour. I alone,</L>
<L>With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,</L>
<L>Hover'd about the enemy, and mark'd</L>
<L>The road he took, then ha&s;ted to my friends;</L>
<L>Whom, with a troop of fifty cho&s;en men,</L>
<L>I met advancing. The pur&s;uit I led,</L>

<L>We fought and conquer'd. E're a &s;word was drawn,</L>
<L>An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,</L>
<L>Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.</L>
<L>Returning home in triumph, I di&s;dain'd</L>

<L>That our good king had &s;ummon'd his bold peers</L>
<L>To lead their warriours to the Carron &s;ide,</L>
<L>I left my father's hou&s;e, and took with me</L>
<L>A cho&s;en &s;ervant to conduct my &s;teps:&mdash;</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BARRY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>AN Epilogue I a&s;k'd; but not one word</L>
<L>Our bard will write. He vows 'tis mo&s;t ab&s;urd</L>
<L>With comick wit to contradict the &s;train</L>
<L>Of tragedy, and make your &s;orrows vain.</L>
<L>Sadly he &s;ays, that pity is the be&s;t,</L>
<L>And noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of the human brea&s;t:</L>
<L>For when its &s;acred &s;treams the heart o'er-flow,</L>
<L>In gu&s;hes plea&s;ure with the tide of woe;</L>
<L>And when its waves retire, like tho&s;e of <HI>Nile,</HI></L>
<L>They leave behind them &s;uch a golden &s;oil,</L>
<L>That there the virtues without culture grow,</L>
<L>There the &s;weet blo&s;&s;oms of affection blow.</L>
<L>The&s;e were his words; void of delu&s;ive art</L>
<L>I felt them; for he &s;poke them from his heart.</L>
<L>Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,</L>
<L>To chace away cele&s;tial melancholy.</L>
