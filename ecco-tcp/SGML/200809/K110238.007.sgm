<P>SIR Arthur arrived in town this morning. He brought the u&s;urer Hen|ley up with him in the &s;ame carriage.</P>
<P>Young St. Ives &s;et out before them, and was in London la&s;t night. He
<PB N="2" REF="3">
drove directly to my lodgings, and I was fortunately at home. This did not look as if I were in the &s;ecret; and if he had any &s;u&s;picions he had not the courage to intimate them.</P>
<P>I condoled with him, &s;aid it was a &s;trange affair, a riddle I could not read, a my&s;tery which time mu&s;t elucidate, for it baffled all conjecture. He did little more than echo me, and I pretend|ed I would have ridden half over the world to recover his &s;i&s;ter, had there been but the lea&s;t clue; but there was not, and I found my&s;elf obliged to &s;it &s;till in de&s;pair and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>He &s;aid it was all very true, and he was very tired. He &s;hould therefore drive home, get &s;ome refre&s;hment, and go to bed. This fellow, Fairfax, walks
<PB N="3" REF="4">
on two legs, looks the world in the face, and counts for one on the mu&s;ter|roll. <Q>But nature, cre&s;cent in him, grew only in thews and bulk.</Q> Yet on the parade, fools and gapers will mi&s;take him for a man.</P>
<P>Contention with Anna St. Ives is ho|nourable, but to &s;eem to &s;hrink from beings like the&s;e, or to practi&s;e con|cealment with &s;uch mere images of en|tity, is repugnant to the generous &s;corn they merit and in&s;pire. Imperious ne|ce&s;&s;ity however pre&s;cribes law, and I took care to prevent Sir Arthur's vi&s;it to me, by having notice &s;ent me of his arrival, and immediately going to the encounter.</P>
<P>To anticipate is to overturn the card|ca&s;tles of this puny race. Come upon
<PB N="4" REF="5">
them unexpectedly, &s;tare at them un|dauntedly, and interrogate them abrupt|ly, and they are put to the rout. Their looks even intreat pardon for the ill they thought, but dur&s;t not utter.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur I own beheld me with a &s;u&s;picious eye; and though he endea|voured to &s;eem to credit me, he did it with an aukward air.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clarke hearing I was there came in, and exceeding even all her former &s;ervour, importuned me, in the mo&s;t direct and vehement manner, to tell what I had done with Mr. Henley and her dear young lady. She more than ever di&s;concerted me. Her exuberant pa&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf alternately to me and her ma&s;ter. Her tears as well as her words were abundant, her urgency
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and ardour extreme, and &s;he ended her apo&s;trophe with again conjuring me to tell what was become of her dear, dear young lady!</P>
<P>"Ay, pray, pray do"&mdash;whimpered the baronet in a maudlin tone, moved by the unfeigned pa&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e|keeper. I gave him a look, and the driveller added&mdash;"if you know."</P>
<P>I was glad of a pretence to get away, and after telling him the di&s;tre&s;s of his mind was the only apology for his con|duct, I in&s;tantly quitted him, without any effort on his part to detain me.</P>
<P>Among other things, Mrs. Clarke re|peatedly reproached her&s;elf for not hav|ing written or &s;ent to my &s;i&s;ter; and the knight acknowledged&mdash;<Q>Ay, it was very neglectful! But his mind had
<PB N="6" REF="7">
been &s;o di&s;turbed that he had forgot|ten it too!</Q></P>
<P>Why do I mi&s;apply my time on be|ings &s;o imbecile? Maugre all my re|&s;olves I have not &s;een her yet, Fairfax! Nor have I opened her letter! I dare not. Her Henley I am &s;ure is in it, and additional rage would be indubita|ble madne&s;s! Neither is this the thing mo&s;t to be feared. She has an expanded heart, a capacious a benevolent heart, and &s;he may have &s;aid &s;omething which were I to &s;ee, and yet do the deed which &s;hall be done, it might &s;hew me more fiend-like than even the foul re|flection of my pre&s;ent thoughts. Per|turbation has done its work; it needs no increa&s;e. This quality of benevo|lence, in which they both glory, is tor|ture
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to recollect. I &s;ay, Fairfax, I ne|ver a&s;ked their charity. Did I not &s;purn it from me, the moment I was in|&s;ulted by the offer? Be pity be&s;towed on beggars: the partiality that &s;prings from affection, or the puni&s;hment due to neglect for me!</P>
<P>I will be with her &s;peedily, Fairfax! Though I linger, I do not relent. Such mercy as the being out of doubt can be&s;tow &s;he &s;hall receive; the pleading world &s;hould not wring a greater from me!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>C. CLIFTON.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> I mu&s;t be &s;peedy: my &s;i&s;ter will hear of the affair by to-morrow's po&s;t, and I &s;hall have her whole artillery playing upon me; and in the form of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
letters I &s;uppo&s;e; for I do not think &s;he will hope any thing from per&s;onal inter|view; I made her too &s;en&s;ibly feel her own in&s;ignificance when la&s;t we met. I expected indeed an attack from her much &s;ooner, for the young lady does not want confidence in her own &s;kill and courage: &s;he is of the Henley &s;chool. However I do not intend to peru&s;e any of her epi&s;tles. I would &s;end them back unopened, but that it would be an avowal of a knowledge of their contents; and I have no need to increa&s;e &s;u&s;picion, who&s;e broad eyes are already glaring at me. But I will im|mediately put an end to the witch, and engender black certainty in her &s;tead! The imp &s;hall appear, and &s;hake horrors from her &s;naky hair!</P>

<P>ONCE more, though but in ima|gination, let me conver&s;e with my friend. I know it is delu&s;ion, but it was the &s;weet cu&s;tom of our &s;ouls, and well may be indulged. Ignorant perhaps of the cau&s;e, my Loui&s;a is at this moment ac|cu&s;ing me of a neglect which my heart
<PB N="10" REF="11">
di&s;avows. Let me as u&s;ual give her the hi&s;tory of that heart: it is a theme from which &s;he has taught me to derive pro|fit.</P>
<P>This is the fifth day of my confine|ment. I have the &s;ame walls, the &s;ame windows and bars to contemplate; and the &s;ame bolting, and locking, and clanking to hear. It is with difficulty that I can at &s;ome few intervals divert my thoughts from the gloom which my own &s;ituation, the di&s;tre&s;s of my family, and the danger of a youth &s;o dear to virtue contribute to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Nor do I know what at this moment may be the affliction of my friend. Should &s;he have heard, &s;he cannot but di&s;cover the principal agent of this dark plot; and exqui&s;ite indeed would
<PB N="11" REF="12">
be the angui&s;h of her mind, could &s;he forget that fortitude and re&s;ignation are duties. May they never be forgotten by me, during this my hour of trial!</P>
<P>My &s;houlder I fear has received &s;ome &s;train or hurt: the pain of it continues to be great, and the inflammation is not abated. The brui&s;es on my arms have in|crea&s;ed in blackne&s;s, and their ten&s;ion is not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed. The hands of tho&s;e bad men mu&s;t have been as rough and callous as their hearts: they had no mercy in their gripe.</P>
<P>There is a lone&s;ome &s;tillne&s;s in this hou&s;e, that favours the di&s;mal reveries which my &s;ituation &s;ugge&s;ts. If my handkerchief do but drop I &s;tart; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tirring of a mou&s;e places Clifton full before me. Yet I repel this weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="13">
with all my force. I de&s;pi&s;e it. Nor &s;hall the&s;e crude vi&s;ions, the hi|deous phantoms of the imagination, &s;ub|due that fortitude in which I mu&s;t wholly confide.</P>
<P>For the&s;e la&s;t two days, Laura has pretended to grieve at confinement: but it is mimic forrow; words of which the heart has no knowledge. She per|ceives I &s;u&s;pect her, and her acting is but the more ea&s;ily detected.</P>
<P>I know not whether it be not my duty to determine to exclude her; though that &s;eems like cowardice. I think it is not in her power to harm me; and for telling, if &s;he have been fal&s;e, &s;he has done her wor&s;t. I never made a practice of concealment, neither will I now have recour&s;e to &s;uch a fallaci|ous
<PB N="13" REF="14">
expedient. Yet &s;he &s;leeps in the &s;ame chamber with me; and ought I not to beware of in&s;piring perfidy with pro|jects? 'Tis true my &s;lumbers are broken, my nights re&s;tle&s;s, and the cracking of the wain&s;cot is as effectual in waking me as a thunder-clap could be. I am re|&s;olved, however, to take the key out of the door, and either hide it or hold it all night in my hand. Mi&s;chief is meant me, or why am I here?</P>
<P>I am continually looking into the clo&s;ets, behind the doors, and under the beds and drawers. I am haunted by the &s;uppo&s;ition that I &s;hall every mo|ment &s;ee this bad man &s;tart up before me! What know I of the ba&s;e engines he may employ, or the wicked arts to which he may have recour&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
But he &s;hall not &s;ubdue me! He may di&s;turb me by day, and terrify me by night; but he &s;hall not &s;ubdue me! Shall the pure mind &s;hake in the pre|fence of evil? Shall the fortitude which &s;afety feels vani&s;h at the approach of danger?</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, I will &s;teel my &s;oul to meet him! I know not how or when he will come! I cannot tell what are the vile black in&s;truments with which he may work! Sleep I &s;carcely have any. I eat with he&s;itation, and drink with trem|bling. I have heard of potions and ba&s;e practices, that make the heart &s;hudder! Yet I &s;ometimes think I could re&s;i&s;t even the&s;e. He &s;hall not &s;ubdue me! Or if he do, it &s;hall be by treachery &s;uch as fiends would demur to perpetrate.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
Why do I think thus of him? Surely, &s;urely, he cannot be &s;o lo&s;t as this! Yet here I am! I own I tremble and recoil; but it is with the dread that he &s;hould plunge him&s;elf &s;o deep in guilt as never more to ri&s;e!</P>
<P>Poor Frank! Where art thou? How are thy wretched thoughts employed? Or art thou &s;till allowed to think? Art thou among the living? If thou art, what is thy &s;tate! Thine is now the mi|&s;ery of impotence, thou who ha&s;t proved thy&s;elf &s;o mighty in act! Thou would&s;t not &s;trike, thou would&s;t not injure; and yet thy foe would &s;ink before thee, had he not allied him&s;elf to perfidy, and had he but&punc;left thee free. His mo&s;t &s;ecret machinations could not have with&s;tood thy &s;earching &s;pirit. Thou would&s;t have
<PB N="16" REF="17">
been here! The&s;e bolts would have flown, the&s;e doors would have opened, and I &s;hould have &s;een my &s;aviour!</P>
<P>He hears me not! Nor thou, Loui&s;a! I am de&s;titute of human aid!</P>
<P>Farewell, farewell! Ah! Farewell in|deed; for I am talking to emptine&s;s and air!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Do I &s;eem to &s;peak with bitterne&s;s of heart? Is there enmity in my words?&mdash;Surely I do not feel it! The &s;pirit of benevolence and truth allows, nay com|mands me to hate the vice; but not its poor mi&s;governed agents. They are wan|dering in the maze of mi&s;take. Igno|rance and pa&s;&s;ion are their guides, and doubt and de&s;peration their tormen|tors.

<P>I AM here&mdash;At the &s;cene of action&mdash;&s;he is in the room above me, and I am ridding my&s;elf of reluctance; &s;tringing my nerves for a&s;&s;ault. I know not why this &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, but I feel that it is!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
I am waiting to que&s;tion Laura; but I ordered her to be in no ha&s;te to come down, when &s;he heard me ring. I would not have my victim &s;u&s;pect me to be here. I would come upon her by &s;urpri&s;e, and not when &s;he was armed and prepared for repul&s;e. I will order the old woman to go pre&s;ently and open and &s;hut the gate; as if &s;he were letting the per&s;on out, who came in when I rung.</P>
<P>I expect, nay am certain, her re&s;i&s;tance will be ob&s;tinate&mdash;But unavailing!&mdash;I &s;ay unavailing!&mdash;Neither hou&s;e nor road are near, and yet I could wi&s;h the &s;cene were removed to the dark gloom of a fore&s;t; embo&s;omed where none but tigers or hyenas &s;hould li&s;ten to her
<PB N="20" REF="21">
&s;hrieks&mdash;I know they will be piercing;&mdash;Heart-rending!&mdash;But&mdash;!</P>
<P>I tell you, Fairfax, I have bani&s;hed all &s;en&s;e of human pity from my bo&s;om: it is an enemy to my purpo&s;e, and that mu&s;t be!&mdash;Though the heavens &s;hould &s;hake and the earth open, it mu&s;t!</P>
<P>Yet do not think, Fairfax, bent as I am on the full fruition of love and vengeance, I would u&s;e cruelty&mdash;Under|&s;tand me: I mean wanton or unnece&s;&s;ary brutality. I will be as forbearing as &s;he will permit. I fear &s;he will not &s;uffer me to care&s;s her tenderly&mdash;But &s;he &s;hall never &s;leep in the arms of Henley!&mdash;She never &s;hall!&mdash;I will make &s;ure of that! My mind is reconciled to all chances, that excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
As I pa&s;&s;ed, I called at the mad-hou&s;e; where I found Mac Fane and the &s;cowl|ing keeper in high divan. They have been horribly alarmed. Henley has at|tempted an e&s;cape, which he was in danger of effecting; but he is brought back, after having led them a &s;hort cha&s;e.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of the&s;e &s;coundrels concerning future con&s;equences are very great, and &s;well almo&s;t to terror. They talked &s;trangely, a&s;ked which way we were to get rid of him at la&s;t, and con|ceive him to be a dangerous enemy. Their thoughts &s;eem tinged with dark lurkings, which they dare not own; and certainly dare not act, without my leave. The&s;e fellows are all villainy! A league with demons would be le&s;s abominable!
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&mdash;I mu&s;t clo&s;e the account, and &s;hake off &s;uch pe&s;tilential &s;coundrels!&mdash;</P>
<P>Laura comes! I will que&s;tion her a little, and then&mdash;!</P>

<P>I am returned, and am &s;till tormented by delay!&mdash;I cannot help it&mdash;I &s;aid I would not u&s;e wilful cruelty: that were to heap unnece&s;&s;ary damnation!</P>
<P>Laura began by &s;oftening my heart with her narrative. Her angel mi&s;tre&s;s is all re&s;ignation, all kindne&s;s, all bene|volence! She almo&s;t forgets her&s;elf, and laments only for me! This I could have with&s;tood; but &s;he has been bru|tally treated, by that intolerable ban dog, Mac Fane, and his blood hounds. Fair|fax,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
how often have I gazed in rapture at the beauteous carnation of her com|plexion, the whitene&s;s of her hands and arms, and the extreme delicacy of their texture! And now tho&s;e tempting arms, Laura tells me, nay, her legs too, are in twenty places disfigured and black, with the gripes and brui&s;es &s;he received. Gibbets and racks overtake the wolf|hearted villains! Her &s;houlder is con|&s;iderably hurt! It is inflamed, and, as &s;he acknowledges, very painful; yet &s;he does not utter a complaint!</P>
<P>Why did this heroic woman ever in|jure me? By what fatal influence am I become her foe? Her gentle kindne&s;s, her calm, unruffled, yet dignified pa|tience I have experienced&mdash;Madman!&mdash;Idiot!&mdash;Have I not experienced her

hatred too, her abhorrence? Did not her own lips pronounce the &s;entence? And do I not know her? Will &s;he re|cede? And &s;hall I?&mdash;Never!&mdash;Never!&mdash;No no&mdash;It mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>But I did rightly. This was not the moment. There would have been &s;ome|thing barbarou&s;ly mean, in making her exert the little &s;trength &s;he has with &s;uch pain and peril.</P>
<P>I rode to Ken&s;ington and procured her a lenitive, with which I returned. The purpo&s;e of vengeance excepted, I would feel as generou&s;ly as her&s;elf; and even vengeance, did I know how, I would dignify&mdash;But do not &s;urmi&s;e that I would retract!&mdash;No, by heaven!

<P>Sleep I have none, re&s;t I have none, peace I have none.

<P>I am here, and have talked with Laura.

<P>This has &s;ugge&s;ted a thought: I will wait here till midnight and &s;leep have

lulled her apprehen&s;ions. It will be better than facing her in the glare of day. Her eye, Fairfax, is terrible in her anger. It is too &s;teady, too &s;trong in con&s;cious innocence to encounter. Darkne&s;s will give me courage, and her terror and de&s;pair. For it mu&s;t come to that! It cannot otherwi&s;e be; and be it mu&s;t! In the blaze of noon, when fortitude is awake and the heart beating high perhaps with re&s;entment, nothing but the goadings of de&s;pair could make me face her. The words &s;he would u&s;e would be terrible, but her looks would petrify!&mdash;By this &s;tratagem I &s;hall avoid them.</P>
<P>Nor do I blu&s;h to own my cowardice, in the pre&s;ence of Anna St. Ives: &s;he being armed with innocence and &s;elf-ap|probation;

<P>How &s;he will behave, or what &s;he will &s;ay to Laura I cannot divine.

<P>IT &s;hall not be!&mdash;She &s;hall not e&s;cape me thus!&mdash;I will not endure this in&s;uf|ferable, this contemptible recantation of my wrongs! Fear is beneath me, and what have I to hope? I have made mi|&s;ery certain! I have paid the price of

de&s;truction, and will hug it to my heart! I know how often I have prevaricated, and have loitered with revenge; but I have not lo&s;t the flame: it burns &s;till, and never &s;hall expire!</P>
<P>The night at Brompton, though a night of &s;torms and evil augury, was heaven to the one I have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. Sleep and re&s;t have for&s;aken me. 'Tis long &s;ince I clo&s;ed my eyes; I know not indeed when; but la&s;t night I did not attempt it. I traver&s;ed my room, open|ed my windows, &s;hut them again, li&s;|tened to the di&s;contented monotony of the watchman without hearing him, thought over my never-forgotten inju|ries, my vengeance, and all the de&s;ola|tion that is to follow, and having ended began again!</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
There were &s;hrieks and cries of mur|der in the &s;treet, about midnight; and this was the only mu&s;ic by which I re|member to have been rou&s;ed. But it was momentary. My reveries returned, and &s;cenes of horror ro&s;e, more &s;warm|ing, dun, and gha&s;tly!</P>
<P>My waking dreams are eternal&mdash;Well, &s;o I would have them!&mdash;They prolong revenge!&mdash;I would have him by the throat for ages!&mdash;Him!&mdash;Hen|ley!&mdash;Would grapple with him; would &s;tab and be &s;tabbed; not in the fictions of a torturing fancy, but arm to arm, &s;teel to &s;teel, poi&s;on to poi&s;on!

<P>Liar that I am! How came I to for|get the beauteous &s;orcere&s;s with whom I found him leagued? I have heard them called angels of light; but I have known them only fiends! They goad me with their virtues, mock at my phren&s;y, defy my rage; and though &s;urrounded by rape, de&s;truction, and de&s;pair, &s;leep and &s;mile, while I wake and howl!</P>

<P>Injury and in&s;ult are bu&s;y with me! This &s;i&s;ter of mine is in town at Sir Arthur's. As &s;he has made the journey I may expect a vi&s;it from her &s;oon: but &s;he &s;hall find no admi&s;&s;ion here. I want no more tormentors!</P>

<P>As I foreboded, &s;he has ju&s;t been, and has behaved in character. She would take no denial from the valet; he was but an infant to the Amazon; &s;he would her&s;elf &s;ee if I were at home, and in &s;he came. The fellow does not want cunning, and he ran up &s;tairs before her, and called out aloud, pur|po&s;ely for me to hear&mdash;<Q>You may &s;ee, madam, if you plea&s;e; the door is

locked, and my ma&s;ter has taken the key with him.</Q></P>
<P>He knew I was determined not to &s;ee her, and while he de&s;ignedly made all the clatter he could, and placed him&s;elf be|fore the entrance, I took the means he had devi&s;ed. She came, turned him a&s;ide, examined the door, pu&s;hed vio|lently again&s;t it, and I believe would willingly have broken it open; but finding her good intentions, I &s;et my &s;houlder to the panel, taking care not to impede the light through the keyhole, which my valet tells me was in&s;pected by her. She ruminated a few &s;econds and then went away; incredulous and high in indignation</P>
<P>Well!&mdash;I &s;ought for warfare, and it has found me. My former encounters
<PB N="72" REF="73">
it &s;eems were but the &s;kirmi&s;hes of a par|ti&s;an: this is a deadly and deci&s;ive battle!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>It is now five o'clock, and I have had a &s;tirring morning. So much the better; action is relief. A me&s;&s;age came to me from Lord Fitz-Allen, de&s;iring to &s;peak with me. I had an inclination not to have gone; but reflecting further I determined to obey his &s;ummons.</P>
<P>However, when I &s;ent up my name, I de&s;ired to know if my &s;i&s;ter were there; and was an&s;wered in the negative. I then made my bow to his lord&s;hip, taking care to inform him that my &s;i&s;ter behaved with great impropriety, and that I was re&s;olved not to &s;ee her, le&s;t I too &s;hould forget that re&s;pect due to my
<PB N="73" REF="74">
family and my&s;elf which &s;he had vio|lated. The peer began with circumlocu|tory hints concerning the elopement&mdash;<Q>An unaccountable affair!&mdash;No ti|dings had yet arrived!&mdash;Surmi&s;es and rumours of a very &s;trange and di&s;|honourable nature were whi&s;pered!&mdash;Mi&s;chief, rape, nay even murder were dreaded!</Q></P>
<P>I refu&s;ed to interpret any of the&s;e in&s;i|nuations as applicable to my&s;elf. At la&s;t his lord&s;hip, after many efforts, &s;aid he had a favour to beg of me, which he hoped I &s;hould not think unrea&s;on|able. I de&s;ired him to inform me what this favour was; and put &s;ome firmne&s;s in my manner, that his lord&s;hip might &s;ee I was not in a temper to &s;uffer an in&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="75">
He an&s;wered, for his own part, he had no doubts: he knew my family, and had always affirmed I could not act unworthy of the gentleman. But, for the peace of mind of Sir Arthur and the other relations of the young lady, he would e&s;teem it an obligation done to him, if I would declare, upon my honour, that I knew nothing of her elopement; of the place &s;he has been conveyed to, or where &s;he is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I then retorted upon his lord&s;hip, that the preface to this reque&s;t entirely precluded compliance; that tho&s;e who whi&s;pered and &s;pread &s;urmi&s;es, and rumours, mu&s;t be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences of their own officiou&s;ne&s;s; and that with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I &s;hould
<PB N="75" REF="76">
certainly, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, refu&s;e to an&s;wer to interrogatories.</P>
<P>My tone was not very conciliatory, and his lord&s;hip knew not whether to be angry or plea&s;ed. But while he was pondering I thought proper to make my exit; and leave him to &s;ettle the conte&s;t between his pride and his puerility as well as he was able.</P>
<P>At my return I found a letter from my &s;i&s;ter, which I will neither an&s;wer nor open. I have my fill of fury, and want no more!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">

it is true, from the &s;itting magi&s;trate, that I would do him the honour to come and &s;peak a word with him, on an affair that concerned a very great and re&s;pect|able family. I returned for an&s;wer that I was engaged, and that I &s;hould notice no &s;uch me&s;&s;ages: but that if any man, great or &s;mall, had to complain of me, the law under&s;tood its duty, and that I &s;hould be readily found at all times.</P>
<P>Whether this be the motion of my &s;u|perb and zealous &s;i&s;ter, or of the arro|gant peer, is more than I can divine. But I &s;hall know &s;ome day, and &s;hall then perhaps &s;trike a balance.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that emi&s;&s;aries and &s;couts are abroad, and that I am watch|ed. I was this evening to have met Mac Fane at the Shake&s;peare; but I
<PB N="77" REF="78">
will not go. Yet as it is pay night, the hungry &s;coundrel mu&s;t not be di&s;ap|pointed. I will therefore write a note to him, and invite him to come and &s;up with me. He will be an agreeable com|panion! But even his company is better, at this moment, than &s;olitude.</P>
<P>I will not let my &s;ervant carry the note directly to him; for if they have their &s;pies in the field, that might be dangerous. He &s;hall take it to the Mount coffee-hou&s;e, and there get a chairman to convey it in &s;afety. I will tell Mac Fane likewi&s;e to come through the &s;hop door; for I am only in lodg|ings; and to &s;tep immediately out of a hackney-coach. I laugh at their counterplots, and wi&s;h I had nothing more to di&s;turb me than the fear of being

<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have been kindly plea&s;ed to reque&s;t I would give you &s;ome account of the means we are pur&s;uing, in hopes to obtain traces that &s;hould lead to a di&s;covery of the very &s;trange affair by
<PB N="88" REF="89">
which we are all perplexed and afflicted. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I can do little more than narrate the di&s;tre&s;s of the va|rious parties, who think them&s;elves in|tere&s;ted in the lo&s;s of the dear friend of my heart, and of the youth &s;o well wor|thy of her affections.</P>
<P>Of the grief of Sir Arthur, madam, you have your&s;elf been a witne&s;s: nor does it &s;eem to abate. I &s;hould wonder indeed if it could; for though I wi&s;h to cheri&s;h hope, I own that the &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence with which this black &s;tratagem has been carried into effect are truly terrifying.</P>
<P>Highly as I e&s;teem and reverence the virtues of young Mr. Henley, I have been free enough to own to you, madam, I never was any admirer of the qualities
<PB N="89" REF="90">
and proceedings of his father. Ju&s;tice however obliges me to &s;ay that he at pre&s;ent expre&s;&s;es a regret &s;o deep, for the lo&s;s of his &s;on, as to prove that he has a con&s;iderable &s;en&s;e of his worth. Money has been the &s;ole object of his efforts: yet, though his &s;on had &s;o great a &s;um in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the time he di&s;appeared, he &s;eems to think but little of the money, compared to the lo&s;s which is indeed &s;o infinitely more deplo|rable.</P>
<P>While I live I &s;hall love and e&s;teem Mrs. Clarke, and her niece Peggy; who&s;e kind hearts overflow with af|fection, both for my Anna St. Ives and young Mr. Henley. Well indeed may Peggy remember poor Frank. He was her &s;aviour in the hour of her
<PB N="90" REF="91">
di&s;tre&s;s. She takes no re&s;t her&s;elf, nor will &s;he &s;uffer her hu&s;band or her brother to take any. They are all continually on the watch; and to do the men ju&s;tice, they do not need a &s;pur.</P>
<P>Mr. Webb, her brother, with who&s;e unfortunate hi&s;tory I &s;uppo&s;e you are acquainted, gives proofs of zeal which are very affecting. The tears have fre|quently gu&s;hed from me, at &s;eeing the virtuous anxiety of his mind, and at re|collecting what that mind was, how and by whom it was pre&s;erved, and that its whole activity is now exerted, with the &s;trong and cheering hope of returning &s;ome portion of the good it has re|ceived!</P>
<P>I know, madam, how great your &s;or|row
<PB N="91" REF="92">
mu&s;t be, as well as that of all the once happy relations of a young lady of endowments and virtues &s;o rare. Yet deep as this &s;orrow is, I think it &s;carcely can exceed the angui&s;h I feel; convinced as I am that my mi&s;taken, my unhappy brother is the cau&s;e of this much dread|ed mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I told you, madam, I would go to him. I have been, and could gain no admi&s;&s;ion. I have written; and have received no an&s;wer. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, added to the perturbation of mind which was &s;o di&s;coverable in him when he was la&s;t at Ro&s;e-Bank, do but con|firm my fears of his guilt.</P>
<P>But as it becomes us to act, and not to lament, while there is any po&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="92" REF="93">
that action &s;hould give us relief, I joined Mr. Abimelech Henley in his opinion, that we ought to apply to the civil power for redre&s;s. We fir&s;t indeed prevailed on Lord Fitz-Allen to &s;peak to Mr. Clifton; but it was to no purpo&s;e: my brother behaved, as I prophe&s;ied he would, with di&s;dainful &s;ilence. I own I had &s;ome hopes that my letter would have touched his heart: I am &s;orry to find they were &s;o ill&punc;founded.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton having refu&s;ed even to deny his knowledge of the affair to his Lord&s;hip, he con&s;ented that application &s;hould be made to a civil magi&s;trate. But Lord Fitz-Allen is &s;trangely preju|diced, and is per&s;uaded, or affects to be, that Mr. Clifton, being a gentleman, is
<PB N="93" REF="94">
incapable of a di&s;honourable act; and that young Mr. Henley and Anna St. Ives have eloped. The &s;um of money Mr. Henley had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion con|firms him in this opinion: and he has &s;everal times half per&s;uaded Sir Arthur, and &s;ome others, to be of his &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>Hearing this, and finding no po&s;itive accu&s;ation, and that nothing but &s;urmi&s;e could be preferred again&s;t Mr. Clifton, who&s;e character was under&s;tood to be highly vindictive, the magi&s;trate refu&s;ed to do any thing more than &s;end a polite reque&s;t, that he would come and &s;peak in his pre&s;ence to the parties con|cerned.</P>
<P>My brother refu&s;ed in terms of me|nace and defiance; and we returned
<PB N="94" REF="95">
home hopele&s;s; yet again having re|cour&s;e to watching the door of my bro|ther's lodgings, as has been done for the&s;e &s;everal days. But we have learnt nothing. And what indeed can we learn? Mr. Webb and his brother-in-law have twice followed him on foot, to the livery &s;tables; and have &s;een him mount his hor&s;e, and ride out of town: but the &s;peed with which he went quickly took him out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The roads he cho&s;e were in oppo&s;ite directions: but that they might ea&s;ily be, and yet lead to the &s;ame place. They are out at pre&s;ent; for their indu&s;try is unwearied.</P>
<P>It is in vain to think of pur&s;uing my brother on hor&s;eback; for he mu&s;t infal|libly &s;ee his pur&s;uer. He went one time
<PB N="95" REF="96">
over We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge, and the other through Tyburn-turnpike up to Pad|dington. Their pre&s;ent project is, the fir&s;t time he goes out, to waylay both the&s;e roads, and to get a&s;&s;i&s;tants.

<P>WHY ay! He who opens the flood-gates of mi&s;chief is nece&s;&s;arily in mo&s;t danger of being &s;wept away by the torrent!&mdash;I have drunken deeply of ruin, and &s;oon &s;hall have my fill!</P>
<P>You warned me to beware of this raven: you told me he &s;cented car|rion!&mdash;
<PB N="97" REF="98">
I laughed at your prophecy!&mdash;It is fulfilled!&mdash;I am a gull!&mdash;The fleeced, cheated, de&s;picable gull of the infernal villain Mac Fane!</P>
<P>It was right that I &s;hould be loaded with every &s;pecies of contempt for my|&s;elf. I have been the fool, the gudgeon, the ineffable a&s;s to lo&s;e a &s;um of money to him, which to pay would be de&s;truc|tion!&mdash;I begin to hate my&s;elf with mo&s;t &s;trange inveteracy! Could I meet &s;uch another fellow, I would &s;pit in his face&mdash;Fairfax, it is true&mdash;By hell I hold my|&s;elf in mo&s;t rooted and ample antipa|thy!</P>
<P>I find I have &s;trangely mi&s;taken my own character and talents&mdash;I once thought to have driven the world before
<PB N="98" REF="99">
me, and to have whipped oppo&s;ition into immediate compliance: but it &s;eems I am my&s;elf one of the very &s;orry wretches at whom I was &s;o all alive and ready to gibe, and &s;purn! The&s;e are odd and unaccountable things! And it appears that I am a very poor creature! A mo&s;t indubitable driveller! The twin-brother of imbecility! Ay, the counterpart and compeer of Edward St. Ives, and the tool of the mo&s;t barefaced of cheats, as well as his familiar!&mdash;Well! I have lived long enough to make the di&s;covery; and it is now high time to depart!</P>
<P>I wrote to you but ye&s;terday: but events ha&s;tily tread on each other's heels, and if I do not relate them now I never
<PB N="99" REF="100">
&s;hall. I told you I expected the gambler to &s;upper, by my own invitation&mdash;Ay, ay!&mdash;I am a very Solomon!&mdash;</P>
<P>I dined at home. I knew not indeed to what extremes the St. Ives hunters might proceed: or whether they would make accu&s;ation upon oath, &s;ufficient to authori&s;e a magi&s;trate in granting a warrant, to bring me before him; but the attempt mu&s;t have been im|potent and abortive, I therefore de|termined to brave them: however I heard no more of them or their &s;u&s;pi|cions.</P>
<P>As I &s;at ruminating on pa&s;t events, on my &s;i&s;ter and her epi&s;tle, and par|ticularly on the zeal with which Anna St. Ives appealed to the letter written
<PB N="100" REF="101">
by her, which I had received from Laura, my curio&s;ity was &s;o far excited that at la&s;t I determined to read them both. I own, Fairfax, they both moved me!&mdash;This &s;i&s;ter of mine, enraged as I am again&s;t her, has &s;omehow found the art of making her&s;elf re&s;pected. Her zeal has character and efficacy in it: I mean per&s;ua&s;ion. I could not re|&s;i&s;t &s;ome of the &s;en&s;ations &s;he intended to in&s;pire. She cited pa&s;&s;ages from the letters of her friend that were dag|gers to me! At the very time I was &s;eeking to quarrel with Anna, &s;he angel-like was ince&s;&s;ant in my prai&s;e!&mdash;And &s;uch prai&s;es, Fairfax&mdash;! There was no re&s;i&s;ting it!&mdash;She thought gene|rou&s;ly, nobly, ay &s;ublimely of me: while
<PB N="101" REF="102">
my ira&s;cible jealou&s;y, fal&s;e pride, and vindictive &s;pirit were eager only to find cau&s;e of offence!</P>
<P>And yet I know not!&mdash;I cannot keep my mind to a point! Surely <HI>I had cau&s;e of offence:</HI> real cau&s;e?&mdash;Surely the re|tribution I &s;ought had ju&s;tice in it?&mdash;She could not be wholly blamele&s;s?&mdash;No!&mdash;That would indeed be di&s;traction!</P>
<P>I then ventured to read the letter of Anna&mdash;On paper or in &s;peech &s;he is the fame: energetic, awful, and affecting!</P>
<P>While I was reading this la&s;t Mac Fane entered, and &s;oon put an end to my meditations. Did I tell you I had been fool enough to invite him to &s;up|per?&mdash;He had not been with me half an hour before I was mo&s;t intolerably weary of his company!</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">
After having vapoured of the feats of him&s;elf and the &s;cowling ra&s;cal his col|league, to remind me of my high obli|gations to them, and talking as u&s;ual with mo&s;t bitter malevolence again&s;t Henley, he &s;oon began to de&s;cant on the old &s;ubject; gaming&mdash;To a&s;k a madman why he is mad were vain! I was importuned by his jargon&mdash;<Q>He had been pigeoned only la&s;t night of no le&s;s than &s;even hundred pounds!</Q> Repetitions, imprecations, and lies, all of the &s;ame kind, &s;ucceeded as fa&s;t as he could utter them!</P>
<P>I know all this ought to have put me upon my guard; and I know too that it did not. I believe I had &s;ome lurk|ing vanity in my mind; a per&s;ua&s;ion that I could beat him at picquet. I was
<PB N="103" REF="104">
weary both of my&s;elf and him; was primed for mi&s;chief, and cared not of what kind. If you a&s;k me for any bet|ter rea&s;on, why, knowing him as I did, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be the tool of this fellow, I can only &s;ay I have none to give!</P>
<P>I ordered my own &s;ervant to fetch half a dozen packs of cards, and ima|gined this precaution was &s;ome &s;ecurity. What will not men imagine, when their pa&s;&s;ions are afloat and rea&s;on is flown?</P>
<P>To give you the hi&s;tory of how I was led on, from one act of idioti&s;m to ano|ther, or how after having lo&s;t one thou|&s;and I could be lunatic enough to lo&s;e a &s;econd, and after a &s;econd a third, and &s;o on to a tenth, is more than my pre|&s;ent temper of mind will permit. It is
<PB N="104" REF="105">
quite &s;ufficient to tell you that I have ruined my&s;elf; and that there is not, upon the face of the earth, a fellow I &s;o thoroughly de&s;pi&s;e as Coke Clifton; no not even Mac Fane him&s;elf! Below the lowe&s;t am I fallen; for I am his dupe, nay his companion, and what is wor&s;e his debtor! It is time I were out of the world&mdash;So mi&s;erable a being does not crawl upon its &s;urface.</P>
<P>It is the very heyday of mi&s;chief, and I mu&s;t abroad among it. The exact manner of the cata&s;trophe I cannot fore|&s;ee, but it mu&s;t be tragical. I have &s;omething brooding in my mind, the outlines of a conclu&s;ion, which rather plea&s;es me. I have &s;worn to avenge my&s;elf of Anna, di&s;inherit my &s;i&s;ter, and never to pay Mac Fane. The&s;e oaths
<PB N="105" REF="106">
mu&s;t be kept. Anna mu&s;t fall! If &s;he will but deign to live afterward, &s;he &s;hall be my heir. And for my&s;elf, I know how to find a ready quietus!</P>
<P>My mind &s;ince this la&s;t affair is better reconciled to its de&s;tiny, and even le&s;s di&s;turbed than before: for previous to this, there &s;eemed to be &s;ome bare po&s;&s;i|bility of a generous relea&s;e, on my part, and a more generous forgetfulne&s;s of injuries on theirs. But now, all is over! I have but to puni&s;h my opponents a little, and my&s;elf much, and having puni&s;hed expire.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have taken upon my&s;elf the painful duty of informing you of all that pa&s;&s;es, relative to this unhappy af|fair, it becomes me to be punctual. It is afflicting to own that our agitation and di&s;tre&s;s, in&s;tead of abating, are in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">
Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to gain a &s;ight of my brother, I determined to at|tempt to que&s;tion his valet. Mr. Webb received my in&s;tructions accordingly, watched him to &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, and delivered a me&s;&s;age from me, that if he would come to me I would pre&s;ent him with ten guineas.</P>
<P>He made no he&s;itation, but followed Mr. Webb immediately.</P>
<P>Either he is very artful or very igno|rant of this affair. One circum&s;tance excepted, he appears to know nothing.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed him any reward, any &s;um he &s;hould him&s;elf name, if he could but give us &s;uch information as might lead to the recovery of our lo&s;t friends: but he prote&s;ted very &s;olemnly he had none to give; except that he owns having
<PB N="110" REF="111">
been employed, by his ma&s;ter, to invei|gle the lad away, who wrote the anony|mous letter, and whom Mr. Clifton, by practi&s;ing on the lad's credulity and gra|titude, &s;ent to France.</P>
<P>The valet indeed acknowledges his ma&s;ter is exceedingly di&s;turbed in mind; that he does not &s;leep, nor even go to bed, except &s;ometimes to&s;&s;ing him&s;elf on it with his clothes on, and almo&s;t in|&s;tantly ri&s;ing again; and that he has &s;ent for his attorney, to make his will.</P>
<P>I will not endeavour to paint my &s;en|&s;ations at hearing this account. I will only add that another incident has hap|pened, which gives them additional acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>I believe, madam, you have heard both my brother and my Anna &s;peak of
<PB N="111" REF="112">
and de&s;cribe a young French nobleman, who paid his addre&s;&s;es to her, and who was the occa&s;ion of the ra&s;h leap into the lake, by which Mr. Clifton endan|gered his life? This gentleman, Count de Beaunoir, is arrived in London; and has this morning paid a vi&s;it to Sir Arthur St. Ives.</P>
<P>He enquired fir&s;t and eagerly after my friend; with whom, like all who know her, he is in raptures. Sir Ar|thur, forgetting his character, and the apparently rodomontade but to him very &s;erious manner in which he had declared him&s;elf her champion, told him the whole &s;tory, as far as it is known to us; not omitting to mention Mr. Clifton as the per&s;on on whom all our &s;u&s;picions
<PB N="112" REF="113">
fell, and relating to him the full grounds of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of the Count occa|&s;ioned him to li&s;ten with uncommon at|tention to what he heard; and he clo&s;ed the narrative of Sir Arthur by affirming it was all true. He was convinced be|yond contradiction of its truth, for he had him&s;elf brought over the lad, whom Mr. Clifton had &s;ent, with pretended di&s;|patches, to a friend of his in Paris.</P>
<P>The lad it appears, &s;u&s;pecting all was not right, and finding no probability of returning, but on the contrary that he was watched, and even refu&s;ed a pa&s;&s;|port, had applied to the Count through the medium of his &s;ervants, with whom he had formerly been acquainted, to
<PB N="113" REF="114">
protect and afford him the means of re|turning to England.</P>
<P>The lad was &s;ent for, his &s;tory heard, and he was then que&s;tioned concerning Anna St. Ives; and he had heard enough of the affair from Mr. Abime|lech Henley, and from the &s;ervants, to know that the propo&s;ed match, between Mr. Clifton and Anna, was broken off; and that &s;he refu&s;ed to admit his vi&s;its. When Count de Beaunoir la&s;t &s;aw Sir Arthur, at Paris, he had a&s;&s;ured him very &s;eriou&s;ly that, &s;hould ever Anna St. Ives find her&s;elf di&s;engaged and he knew it, he would in&s;tantly make her a tender of his hand and fortune: and he had no &s;ooner heard the lad's &s;tory than he determined immediately to make his in|tended journey to England.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
My heart &s;hudders while I relate it, but I dread le&s;t it &s;hould be a fatal jour|ney, for him or my brother, or both! For he declared to Sir Arthur, without he&s;itation, he would wait on Mr. Clifton directly, and oblige him either to pro|duce Anna St. Ives, or meet him in the field.</P>
<P>Wretched folly! De&s;tructive error! When will men cea&s;e to think that vice and virtue ought to meet on equal terms; and that injury can be atoned by blood?</P>
<P>The Count had left his addre&s;s with Sir Arthur, and the moment I heard what had pa&s;&s;ed I flew to his lodgings. He was not at home, and I waited above an hour. At la&s;t he came, and I at|tempted to &s;hew him both the folly and
<PB N="115" REF="116">
wickedne&s;s of the conduct he was pur|&s;uing.</P>
<P>He li&s;tened to me with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s, paid me a thou&s;and compli|ments, acknowledged the truth of every thing I &s;aid, but very evidently de|termined to act in a manner directly op|po&s;ite. I very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly laboured to make him promi&s;e, upon his honour, he would not &s;eek redre&s;s by duelling; but in vain. He an&s;wered by eva&s;ion; with all po&s;&s;ible de&s;ire to have obliged me, but with a foregone conclu&s;ion that it could not be.</P>
<P>Pardon me, madam, for writing a narrative &s;o melancholy: but &s;incerity is nece&s;&s;ary; intelligence might have come to you in a di&s;torted form, and might have produced much wor&s;e effects. For
<PB N="116" REF="117">
my own part, I have no other mode of conduct but that of writing and of &s;peaking the &s;imple truth; being con|vinced there is no &s;hade of di&s;gui&s;e, artifice, or fal&s;ehood, that is not immo|ral in principle, and pernicious in prac|tice.</P>
<P>I have been very bu&s;y. I have &s;ent for the lad whom the count brought over with him, and have made enquiries. The an&s;wers he gave me all tend to con|firm our former &s;u&s;picions. He has re|lated the &s;tory, at length, of the man|ner in which he was inveigled away, and prevailed on to go to France.</P>
<P>I next que&s;tioned him concerning his aunt; and he knows nothing of her, has never heard from her, and is a&s;toni&s;hed at what can have become of her. He
<PB N="117" REF="118">
means, however, to go this evening to a relation's hou&s;e, where he thinks he is certain he &s;hall hear of her; and has then promi&s;ed to come and let me know&mdash;But to what purpo&s;e? We &s;hall find &s;he has been &s;ent out of the way by Mr. Clifton: and what further informa|tion will that afford? None, except to confirm what needs no confirming; except to &s;hew the blindne&s;s, craft, and turpitude of his mind!</P>

<P>SO, Fairfax, you have &s;uffered the lad to e&s;cape you; cautioned and entreated as you were! You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, by what means; and with whom he is at pre&s;ent?&mdash;Well, well!&mdash;It is no matter&mdash;I have quarrels enough on hand, and
<PB N="119" REF="120">
enemies enough!&mdash;I would fain die in peace with &s;omebody!&mdash;I forgive you&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e you did your be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly po&s;&s;ible that this may be the la&s;t letter you will ever receive from me. Remember me now and then. Should Henley and Anna St. Ives &s;ur|vive me, let them know I was not &s;o en|tirely blind to their worth as they might perhaps &s;uppo&s;e. Shew them my letters if you will: I care not who &s;ees them now! Let the truth be told! I &s;hall be deaf enough to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t had a vi&s;it from the crazy count; a threatening one. A challenge has pa&s;&s;ed, and we are to meet to-mor|row.</P>
<P>So it is agreed; but I doubt whether I &s;hall keep the appointment. If there
<PB N="120" REF="121">
be one &s;park of re&s;entment in the &s;oul of Henley, it is po&s;&s;ible I may fail. I mean to give him the fir&s;t chance. It is his by right; and why &s;hould not I do right even to him, once in my life? This farrago of folly, this pride of birth, and riches, and I know not what el&s;e lumber, is very contemptible!</P>
<P>Fairfax, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my thoughts forces more than one truth upon me. But what have I to do with truth, in a world from which I learned &s;o much error that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to exi&s;t in it? The&s;e wi&s;e people &s;hould leave us fools to wrangle, be wretched, and cut each other's throats as we li&s;t, with|out intermeddling: 'tis dangerous. But Truth is a zealot; Wi&s;dom will be cry|ing
<PB N="121" REF="122">
in the &s;treets; and Folly meeting her &s;eldom fails to deal her blow.</P>
<P>My mind is made up: my affairs are &s;ettled, my lawyer has written out my will, and it is &s;igned. You will find your&s;elf mentioned in it, Fairfax. I have nominated my &s;i&s;ter my executor, and Anna St. Ives my heir. I have been reading Loui&s;a's letter again: it is full of pathos. She has more under|&s;tanding than I have been willing to al|low, and I have relented. She is not forgotten in my will: I would not have her think of me with everla&s;ting hatred.</P>
<P>I know not how it is, Fairfax, but I feel more compunction, at pre&s;ent, than I ever remember to have felt before. I am grown into &s;elf&punc;contempt; and the haughty notions, which were the &s;upport
<PB N="122" REF="123">
of my high and &s;ometimes arrogant con|duct, are faded. I could think only of Coke Clifton, and I now know Coke Clifton to be a very wretched dolt!</P>
<P>Be not deceived by my pre&s;ent tone: make no fal&s;e predictions in favour either of my&s;elf or Anna St. Ives. De|&s;pair and fate are not more fixed than is my plan. My hor&s;e will pre&s;ently be at the door. I &s;hall mount him the moment I have ended this letter, and &s;hall pro|ceed directly to Anna. There, after all is ended, the enchantment too &s;hall end, and the mi&s;venturous lady and her im|pri&s;oned knight &s;hall both be &s;et free.</P>
<P>Should Henley, urged by de&s;pair to &s;eek revenge, accept my defiance and meet me in the field, the conflict mu&s;t be fierce, and &s;uch as might in&s;pire terror.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
To &s;ay the truth, were it not to prove my&s;elf his equal, perhaps his ma&s;ter and vanqui&s;her, I would not lift my hand again&s;t his life. It would be &s;ome relief to my &s;oul to fall by his arm. He is a noble fellow, and I have done him wrong. Would he or Anna but charitably &s;trike, I would die ble&s;&s;ing them, ea&s;ed by the expiatory blow. Perhaps they are the only two beings for whom I ever could have had the &s;ame admiration; and, if what they tell me be true, admiration continued always ripens into love. They &s;hewed affection toward me, and would, I believe, have loved me. But we did not under&s;tand each other, and the mi&s;|take has been mutually fatal&mdash;Would I had never injured them!&mdash;But it is vain!&mdash;The die is ca&s;t!&mdash;We are all fated!&mdash;
<PB N="124" REF="125">
Having accompli&s;hed my revenge, and accompli&s;h it I will, they cannot live and not be mi&s;erable! They mu&s;t cur&s;e my hated memory, and bla&s;pheme again&s;t my honour!&mdash;It cannot be otherwi&s;e&mdash;Let our grave therefore be glorious! They are brave &s;pirits, and will mock my power even to the la&s;t. I love their high courage. Perhaps they &s;hall find I have a kindred &s;oul!&mdash;Oh would they die forgiving me&mdash;!</P>
<P>I know not well whither my thoughts are wandering&mdash;They perhaps may re|fu&s;e to die&mdash;They may &s;ay it is their duty to live, even though doomed to be wretched&mdash;I know them&mdash;What they think they will act&mdash;Well, well!&mdash;Let de&s;tiny di&s;po&s;e of events&mdash;To me all chances are welcome, all are alike.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126">
As to this count, &s;hould Henley re|fu&s;e vengeance, I owe him no mercy. 'Twas he who prompted me to the fran|tic act that fir&s;t made me the debtor of the man I have mo&s;t injured. I almo&s;t contemn a foe &s;o in&s;ignificant&mdash;Not that he is deficient in bravery, or &s;kill&mdash;But what is he?&mdash;What are his wrongs?&mdash;'Tis lunacy, not anger rankling at his heart!&mdash;Or if it were?&mdash;The hungry wolf-dog is no fit combatant for the fa|mi&s;hed lion!</P>

<P>With that hope, and addre&s;&s;ing my|&s;elf to &s;uch per&s;ons, I will endeavour, as long as I have the means and am able, accurately to recount the particulars of what has befallen me, from the time I was fir&s;t be&s;et to the late&s;t minute of my remaining where I am; whether my re|moval happen by death or relea&s;e; of which, though apparently beyond hope, it would certainly be wrong to de&s;pair.</P>

Oh, Anna St. Ives!

<P>Before I begin, it is nece&s;&s;ary to no|tice that I had the &s;um of eight thou&s;and pounds about me, in bank-bills: for it is this circum&s;tance which &s;eems to have in&s;ured my death. Our walk was to have ended by four o'clock, and the money to have been left at the banker's as we returned. I cannot however ac|quit my&s;elf of neglect. I ought not to have forgotten that money, under our pre&s;ent wretched &s;y&s;tem, is the grand &s;timulus to vice; that accidents very little dreamed of daily happen; and that procra&s;tination is always an error.</P>
<P>As I was walking with the lady who&s;e name I have ju&s;t mentioned, in &s;ome fields between Ken&s;ington and Bromp|ton,
<PB N="132" REF="133">
we &s;aw Mr. Clifton pa&s;s on hor&s;e|back, and I believe in le&s;s than a minute a man a&s;&s;ault him, and fire a pi&s;tol, with an intent to rob him as I then &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I ran to his aid; and, immediately after the flight of this real or imaginary robber, I was my&s;elf attacked, and laid &s;en&s;ele&s;s, by a blow I received on the &s;ide of my head; which, as there was no per&s;on in front able to &s;trike at me, mu&s;t have come from behind.</P>
<P>I &s;aw no more for that time of Mr. Clifton. The blow was very violent, and is &s;till &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>When I recovered my &s;en&s;es, I found my arms confined by a &s;traight wai&s;t|coat; &s;uch as are u&s;ed to &s;ecure maniacs. I endeavoured to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but the man who had charge of me, for
<PB N="133" REF="134">
there were &s;everal, thru&s;t his thumb in the larynx, forced open my mouth, and gagged me. He has twice had occa&s;ion, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to u&s;e me thus; and both times with &s;uch violence as &s;eemingly to require the utmo&s;t effort mind could make, to recover re&s;piration; the thru&s;t of his thumb was &s;o mercile&s;s, and the &s;en&s;ation of &s;trangling &s;o &s;evere.</P>
<P>They brought me to a hou&s;e tho|roughly prepared for confinement. It is an old but heavy building, walled round, and provided with bars, bolts, chains, ma&s;&s;y locks, and every precau|tion to impede e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I was led up one pair of &s;tairs, to apartments con&s;i&s;ting of two chambers; the one roomy, the other much &s;maller; in which la&s;t is a bed.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135">
As &s;oon as I was &s;afe in the room, the ma&s;ter man among them, who as I have &s;ince learned is a profe&s;&s;ed keeper of the in&s;ane, ungagged me, took off the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, and then they all left me.</P>
<P>I &s;tood I know not how long in that &s;tupor of amazement which the &s;cene, and the crowding conjectures of imagi|nation, nece&s;&s;arily produced.</P>
<P>At length, I rou&s;ed my mind to more active enquiry. I then &s;et my&s;elf to in|&s;pect the apartments. In the large&s;t there was a fire place, and a fire; but neither &s;hovel, tongs nor poker; except a &s;mall &s;tick as a &s;ub&s;titute for a poker, with which I certainly could not knock a man down. The furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a chair, a table, a broken looking|gla&s;s, and an old picture, in panel, of
<PB N="135" REF="136">
the &s;acrifice of I&s;aac, with Abraham's knife at his throat. It &s;tares me now in the face, and is a &s;trong emblem of my own &s;ituation; except that my &s;aving angel &s;eems wanting.</P>
<P>In the other room, exclu&s;ive of the bed and its appurtenances, there was a &s;econd chair, which with an old walnut|tree clothes-pre&s;s was its whole inven|tory.</P>
<P>In this room was a clo&s;et, with &s;everal &s;helves almo&s;t to the ceiling; the top|mo&s;t of them &s;o high as but ju&s;t to be reached by me, when &s;tanding on a chair. I &s;wept my hand along the &s;helves, and found them as I thought empty.</P>
<P>I then examined the windows. There were only two, one to each room; the
<PB N="136" REF="137">
remainder having been walled up; and the&s;e each of them provided with thick iron bars, &s;o near to each other as to ad|mit but of a &s;mall part of the face pa&s;&s;|ing between them. There was a ca&s;e|ment to the front room only; and I found a piece of paper tied to the handle of it, on which was written&mdash;<Q>You are clo&s;ely watched: if you attempt to make any &s;ignals, or &s;hout, or take any other means to inform per&s;ons you are here, your lodging will be changed to one much more di&s;agree|able.</Q></P>
<P>Having nothing with which I could employ my&s;elf except my thoughts, and the&s;e flowing in abundance, I &s;at medi|tating and undi&s;turbed till it was almo&s;t dark. A little before five o'clock as I
<PB N="137" REF="138">
&s;uppo&s;e, perhaps later, for I forgot to &s;ay my watch and pur&s;e had been taken from me, with a promi&s;e that they &s;hould be returned, I heard the &s;ound of di&s;tant bolts and locks, that belong to the outer gates and doors, and &s;oon afterward of men in loud conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The keeper and two of his a&s;&s;i&s;tants came up to me, and once more brought the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, into which they bade me thru&s;t my arms. I he&s;itated, and told them I did not choo&s;e to have my arms confined. To which the keeper replied&mdash;<Q>B*** my b**** eyes! None of your jabber, or I'll fetch you another rum one! I'll knock you off the roo&s;t again!</Q></P>
<P>From this &s;peech I conclude it was he
<PB N="138" REF="139">
who gave me the blow with the blud|geon, when I was fir&s;t &s;ecured.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he rai&s;ed his blud|geon; with which kind of weapon they were all three armed, and had locked the door after them. There was no re|medy, and I obeyed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had confined my arms they left me, and remembering the bank|notes which I had in my fob, I began to fear they had come to the knowledge of this circum&s;tance; though I could not imagine by what means. Some &s;hort time afterward, perhaps a quarter of an hour, the bolts and chains of my door again began to rattle, and one per&s;on &s;ingly came in. It was dark, and I could not di&s;tingui&s;h his features, but I
<PB N="139" REF="140">
recollected his form: it was the gambler Mac Fane; the &s;ound of his voice pre&s;ently put it beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>Without &s;peaking a word, he came up to me and made a violent blow at me. I perceived it coming, &s;prang upward, and received it on the tip of my &s;houlder, his hand driving up to my neck. From his manner, I gue&s;s it hurt him at lea&s;t as much as me; for his pa&s;&s;ion immediately became outrageous, and he began cur&s;ing, kicking, &s;pitting at me, and treating me with various other indignities, which are wholly unworthy of remem|brance.</P>
<P>His pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o loud and ve|hement that the keeper, hearing him, came up. Ju&s;t as he entered Mac
<PB N="140" REF="141">
Fane &s;truck me again, and with more effect, for he knocked me down; and was proceeding to kick me in a manner that might perhaps have been fatal, had not the keeper inter|fered.</P>
<P>I &s;aid not one word the whole time, nor as I recollect uttered any &s;ound whatever; and it was with difficulty that the keeper, who is even a more powerful man than him&s;elf, could get him away.</P>
<P>I was once more left in &s;olitude and darkne&s;s; and thus &s;at, with fre&s;h &s;ub|jects for reflection, ruminating on this worthle&s;s Mac Fane, my rencontre with him and Mr. Clifton, the extreme ma|lignancy of his temper, and all the connecting circum&s;tances that are
<PB N="141" REF="142">
allied to events which I cannot now relate.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock my door once more opened, and a little boy of four|teen years of age, as he tells me, brought me a light and &s;ome food. The boy ima|gined me to be mad, and entered the room with great reluctance, his ma&s;ter the keeper &s;tanding at the door, cur&s;ing him, threatening him with the hor&s;e|whip, and obliging him to do as he was bidden! which was to relea&s;e me from the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, &s;pread a threadbare half-dirty napkin over the table, &s;et the plates, and wait till I had eaten. The trepidation of the poor boy at &s;etting my arms at liberty was extreme.</P>
<P>The door was not open but ajar, and &s;ecured by three chains, between which
<PB N="142" REF="143">
the boy crept; the keeper &s;tanding and looking on, with one arm leaning on the middle chain, and his head only in the chamber.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that the boy had an intel|ligent countenance, though con&s;idera|bly under the influence of fear; with &s;trong marks of kindne&s;s in it, but &s;tronger of dejection.</P>
<P>The furniture, the napkin, knives and forks, and every circum&s;tance de|noted the poverty of the man who is my jailer: and his proceedings proved there &s;carcely could be any guilt from which he would &s;tart, to remove this &s;uppo&s;ed evil. The thought could not e&s;cape me, nor the jeopardy in which I &s;hould &s;tand, &s;hould the money I had in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">
I ate what was brought me, and en|deavoured by the mildne&s;s and cheerful|ne&s;s of my look to in&s;pire the boy with confidence. I have no doubt but he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o docile a madman, not having yet ever &s;een any, and being from de&s;cription exceedingly terrified at the idea of the trade to which he has been forcibly apprenticed. I &s;poke to him two or three times, apparently to a&s;k him for the trifles he could reach me, but in reality with another view. I likewi&s;e addre&s;&s;ed him two or three other times in dumb&s;how, with as much mildne&s;s and meaning in my look as circum&s;tances &s;o in&s;ignificant would permit.</P>
<P>The effect my behaviour had upon
<PB N="144" REF="145">
him was very evident; and after begin|ning in fear and confu&s;ion, he left me in &s;omething like hope and tranquillity. My pri&s;on door was locked, the candle taken away, and I left in darkne&s;s. I was no more mole&s;ted during that night.</P>
<P>My thoughts were too bu&s;y to &s;uffer me to &s;leep. I &s;at without moving I know not how long. The extreme &s;till|ne&s;s of all around me added to the unity of the gloom, and produced a &s;tate of mind which gives whole&s;ome exerci&s;e to fortitude. Deep as I was in thought, I remember having been two or three times rou&s;ed by the &s;ternne&s;s of the keeper's voice, which I heard very plainly, and which was generally &s;ome command, clo&s;ing with a cur&s;e, and as I &s;uppo&s;ed directed to the poor boy.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">
My bed-chamber door was open, and after &s;ome time I removed into it, and &s;at down on the feet of the bed, again falling into reveries which fixed me mo|tionle&s;s to the place. I cannot tell what was the hour, nor how long I had been thus &s;eated; but I was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of a door opening, and once more by the voice of the keeper, which I heard &s;o di&s;tinctly as to doubt for a mo|ment whether it were not in my own chamber.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time a broad ray of light &s;uddenly &s;truck again&s;t the wall of my bed-room. I followed it with my eye: I was &s;till at the foot of the bed, and its direction was from the left to the right. I had much inclination to pull off my &s;hoes, and endeavour to trace by what aper|ture
<PB N="146" REF="147">
it entered; but on further reflec|tion, I concluded it would be be&s;t not to excite any alarm, in a mind which cannot but be continually tormented by &s;u&s;picion and fear.</P>
<P>I paid &s;trict attention however to every circum&s;tance that might aid my memory, in tracing it on the morrow.</P>
<P>The voice of the keeper, for he &s;poke &s;everal times, was now much more di&s;tinct than before: he was going to bed, and the que&s;tion&mdash;<Q>Are you &s;ure all is &s;afe?</Q>&mdash;was repeated &s;everal times with great anxiety, and was an&s;wered in the affirmative by a man's voice&mdash;"Do you hear him &s;tir?" &s;aid the keeper.&mdash;The reply was&mdash;<Q>No&mdash;But I am &s;ure I heard him a little before ten.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
The keeper however could not be &s;a|tisfied, and in le&s;s than five minutes I heard my door unbolting. The keeper and both his men came in with their bludgeons. He a&s;ked moro&s;ely why I did not go to bed. I an&s;wered becau&s;e I had no inclination to &s;leep. He went again to the windows, and examined the very walls with the utmo&s;t circum|&s;pection; and afterward turning away &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Sleep or wake, I'll be d**** if you have any chance.</Q></P>
<P>He then left me, and I pre&s;ently after|ward &s;aw the ray of light again, and heard his various motions at going to bed.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the night without clo&s;ing my eyes, and in the morning began to exa|mine where it was po&s;&s;ible the light
<PB N="148" REF="149">
&s;hould obtain admi&s;&s;ion. I placed my|&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and looking to the left &s;aw the clo&s;et was in that direction, and that the door was open.</P>
<P>Looking into it I found that a part of the flooring, in the left hand corner, was decayed; and that the ceiling be|neath had a fi&s;&s;ure of &s;ome width.</P>
<P>I thought it a fortunate circum&s;tance that &s;ounds were conveyed &s;o di&s;tinctly into my apartments: though I &s;peak chiefly of the bed-chamber; for it was the loudne&s;s of the keeper's voice, and the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;urrounding objects, which mo&s;t contributed to my hearing him in the front apartment. Not but the de|cayed &s;tate of the building favoured the conveyance of &s;ound, in all direc|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
I began to con&s;ider how far I could improve the means that offered them|&s;elves, and, watching my opportunity in the cour&s;e of the day, with my fingers and by the aid of the &s;tick left to &s;tir my fire, I removed &s;ome of the decayed mortar to the right and left, and in|crea&s;ed the aperture on the in&s;ide; but was exceedingly careful not to pu&s;h any flakes, or part of the ceiling, down into the floor below. The attention I paid to this was very exact, for it was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence. Nor was I le&s;s accurate in pre&s;&s;ing together the rubbi&s;h I &s;craped away into vacant corners be|tween the joi&s;ts, and leaving no traces that &s;hould lead to di&s;covery.</P>
<P>All the&s;e precautions were highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as the behaviour of the keeper
<PB N="150" REF="151">
had proved; for when he came into my chamber in the morning, as he did early with his cu&s;tomary attendants, he &s;earched and pried about with all the a&s;&s;iduity of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t I was again waited on by the boy, and watched by the keeper. It was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould not excite alarms, in a mind &s;o full of apprehen|&s;ion: I therefore behaved with re&s;erve to the boy, though with great compla|cency, &s;aid little, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him &s;oon.</P>
<P>In the forenoon the door opened again: the boy was &s;ent in with the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, and the keeper &s;aid to me&mdash;<Q>Come, &s;ir; put on your jacket!&mdash;Here, boy, be handy!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>I once more he&s;itated, and a&s;ked if
<PB N="151" REF="152">
Mr. Mac Fane were coming to pay me another vi&s;it? He did not return me a direct an&s;wer, but replied&mdash;<Q>If you will put on the jacket, you may go and &s;tretch your pins for half an hour in the garden: if not &s;tay where you are, and be d****!</Q></P>
<P>After a &s;hort deliberation, I concluded that to comply was prudent; and I very peaceably aided the boy in performing his office. As my back was turned to the keeper, I &s;miled kindly and &s;ignifi|cantly to the boy; to which he replied by a look expre&s;&s;ive of &s;urpri&s;e and cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but that my mind had been mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly enquiring into the po&s;&s;ibility and means of e&s;cape, while in my pri&s;on; and that the mo|ment
<PB N="152" REF="153">
this unexpected privilege was granted me, its whole efforts were di|rected to the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I walked in the garden overlooked, and in a certain manner followed, by the keeper and his attendants: I there|fore traver&s;ed it in various directions, without &s;eeming to pay the lea&s;t atten|tion to the object on which my mind was mo&s;t bu&s;y. But the chance of e&s;cape, my hands being thus confined, appeared to be as &s;mall in the garden as in the hou&s;e. It is completely &s;ur|rounded by a high wall, which joins the hou&s;e at each end. It had one &s;mall gate, or rather door, which was locked and bolted; and had no other entrance, except from the hou&s;e. After having walked about an hour as I &s;uppo&s;e, the keeper
<PB N="153" REF="154">
a&s;ked me, in a tone rather of command than que&s;tion, if I were not tired. I an&s;wered&mdash;No. To which he replied, But I am. Accordingly, without &s;aying another word, I returned to my pri&s;on.</P>
<P>I will attempt no de&s;cription of the &s;uf|ferings of my mind, and the continual fears by which it was di&s;tracted: not for my&s;elf, for there was no appearance, at this time, that any greater harm than confinement was intended me, but for another. The &s;ubject is torturing: but re&s;ignation and fortitude are duties. My rea&s;on for mentioning it is that it &s;trongly excited me to &s;ome prompt ef|fort at e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I could think of none, except of endea|vouring to convince the keeper it was more his intere&s;t to give me my freedom, than to
<PB N="154" REF="155">
keep me in confinement. Con&s;equently, when my dinner was brought, and he had taken his &s;tation, I a&s;ked him if he would do me the favour to conver&s;e with me for half an hour; either pri|vately or in the pre&s;ence of his own men.</P>
<P>He did not &s;uffer me to fini&s;h my &s;en|tence, but exclaimed&mdash;<Q>None of your gab, I tell you! If you &s;peak another word, I'll have you jacketed: and then b*** me, my kiddy, if you get it off again in a hurry!</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid no more, but ate my dinner; ca&s;ting an eye occa&s;ionally to the door, and conjecturing what were the probabi|lities, by a very &s;udden &s;pring, of break|ing the chain, for he had only put one up, or of drawing the &s;taple by which it was held, and which, from the thickne&s;s
<PB N="155" REF="156">
of the wood-work, I knew could not be clenched. It was not po&s;&s;ible, I believe, for mind to be actuated by &s;tronger mo|tives than mine was, in my wi&s;h to e&s;cape: the circum&s;tance of the &s;ingle chain might not occur a &s;econd time, and I determined on the trial.</P>
<P>I prolonged my dinner till I perceived him begin to yawn, and at la&s;t turn his head the other way. I was about twelve feet di&s;tant from the door. I ro&s;e quietly, made two &s;teps, and then gave a &s;udden &s;pring. I came with great violence again&s;t the door, but it re&s;i&s;ted me, and, of cour&s;e, I fell backward.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t moment of &s;urpri&s;e, the keeper in&s;tantly locked the door, and, in a rage of cur&s;ing, called his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. They however &s;oon pacified him, by
<PB N="156" REF="157">
turning his attention to the &s;trength of his own fa&s;tenings, and &s;coffing at my fruitle&s;s attempt.</P>
<P>But this incident induced him to change his mode: he &s;tood no more with the door ajar to watch me, but, after &s;ending in the boy, locked and bolted it upon us.</P>
<P>I was in full expectation of the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat; and his forbearance, I ima|gine, was occa&s;ioned by the &s;trict orders he mu&s;t have received to the contrary. His threat indeed, when I attempted to &s;peak, is a proof rather again&s;t this &s;up|po&s;ition; and I can &s;olve it no other way than by &s;uppo&s;ing that his orders were, if I attempted per&s;ua&s;ion with him, he would then be at liberty to do a thing to which he &s;eemed exceedingly prone.
<PB N="157" REF="158">
His fears for him&s;elf, &s;hould I e&s;cape, mu&s;t inevitably be &s;trong; and a man, who has waded far enough in error to commit an act &s;o violent, will willingly plunge deeper, in proportion as &s;uch fears increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;udden &s;pring I had made at the door, combining with the &s;uppo&s;ition of madne&s;s, had &s;uch an effect upon the poor boy that, hearing the door lock and &s;eeing me as he imagined let loo&s;e upon him, his fright returned in full force. His looks were &s;o pale, and he trembled &s;o violently, that I feared he would fall into a fit. I went up to him with the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s, and &s;aid&mdash;Don't be afraid, my good boy! Indeed I will not hurt you.</P>
<P>The keeper &s;carcely &s;tayed a minute
<PB N="158" REF="159">
before, recollecting I had been long enough at dinner, he opened the door again, but with the caution of the three chains, and bade the boy take away.</P>
<P>I then began to accu&s;e my&s;elf of pre|cipitancy; but I &s;oon remembered that every thing ought to be hazarded, where every thing is at &s;take. My fears were not for my&s;elf; and, while my arms were free, could I have come upon them thus &s;uddenly, &s;ucce&s;s was far from improba|ble. Vice is always cowardly; and, dif|ference of weapons out of the que&s;tion, three to one are not invincible odds.</P>
<P>It now fir&s;t occurred to me how pru|dent it would be to conceal my bank|bills, and I began to con&s;ider which were the be&s;t means. I took them out, ex|amined
<PB N="159" REF="160">
their numbers, and endeavoured to fix them in my memory.</P>
<P>This was no difficult ta&s;k; but pru|dence required that nothing &s;hould be left to chance, and I took the burnt end of my &s;tick, and going into the back room, wrote the numbers again&s;t the wall, in a place which, from its darkne&s;s, was lea&s;t liable to notice. Indeed I con|&s;idered there was little to fear, even &s;hould the figures I made be &s;een, for I wrote them in one continued line, which rendered them unintelligible without a key.</P>
<P>I then once more took my chair, and placed it at the clo&s;et door; thinking that to hide them at one corner of the topmo&s;t &s;helf might perhaps be the &s;e|cure&s;t place. I previou&s;ly began to feel,
<PB N="160" REF="161">
and, at the far end of the &s;helf, I put my hand upon &s;omething; which, when brought to light, proved to be the re|mainder of a bundle of quills.</P>
<P>I felt again, but found nothing more there.</P>
<P>I then removed my chair toward the other end, and after two or three times &s;weeping my hand ineffectually along the &s;helf, I &s;truck the edge of it again&s;t the wall, and more than half a quire of paper fell flat upon it.</P>
<P>This led me to conjecture that the &s;helf had been a hiding place, perhaps, to &s;ome love-&s;ick girl, and that it was po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be ink. After another more accurate &s;earch, and turn|ing my other hand, with which I could
<PB N="161" REF="162">
feel better to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, I found an ink-bottle.</P>
<P>I took down my trea&s;ure, and exa|mined it: there was cotton in the bottle, but the ink was partly mouldy and partly dried away. However, by the aid of a little water, I pre&s;ently procured more than &s;ufficient to write down my num|bers. But I wanted a pen, and for this there was no &s;uccedaneum.</P>
<P>As the &s;afe&s;t way of pre&s;erving what might become u&s;eful, I returned my trea&s;ure to the &s;helf on which it had been found; and for that rea&s;on began to con&s;ider of another place for my bank|notes. After looking carefully round both chambers, I at la&s;t lifted up the old picture, and here I found a break in the wain&s;cot; in which was in&s;erted, laterally,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
full as much more writing paper as the quantity I had di&s;covered in the clo&s;et. I took away the paper entirely, le&s;t, if &s;een, it &s;hould lead to further &s;earch; and, twi&s;ting up the bills, laid them &s;o as to be certain of recovering them, when I plea&s;ed. The paper I put upon the &s;helf.</P>
<P>When the boy brought my &s;upper, I a&s;ked him his name, how old he was, and other trifling que&s;tions, to familiarize and embolden him; and learned from his an&s;wers that he had a poor mother, who was unable to provide for him, and that he had been bound apprentice to this keeper by the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I enquired if he could write and read?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, yes; he had been called
<PB N="163" REF="164">
the be&s;t &s;cholar of the charity &s;chool in which he was bred.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked if he continued to prac|ti&s;e his learning?</P>
<P>He replied he loved reading very much indeed: but he had no books.</P>
<P>Did he write?</P>
<P>He had no paper.</P>
<P>Was there a pen and ink in the hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Yes; but the pen was &s;eldom u&s;ed, and good for nothing.</P>
<P>Could he get me a pen?</P>
<P>If he had but a quill, he could make me one.</P>
<P>Had he a pen-knife?</P>
<P>No; he had forgotten that: but one of the men had a knife with &s;everal blades, and he could a&s;k him to lend it.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
And what &s;hould he write, &s;uppo&s;ing he had paper?</P>
<P>A letter.</P>
<P>To whom?</P>
<P>To his mother.</P>
<P>I thought it not right to expo&s;e my &s;tores to him, and therefore &s;uffered him to go for that time, without &s;aying any thing more on the &s;ubject. But my di&s;|cour&s;e with him had pretty well driven all apprehen&s;ion from his mind. I was cautious to &s;peak in a very low tone of voice; and, without being bidden, he had acutene&s;s enough to follow my ex|ample.</P>
<P>The next day, at breakfa&s;t, I gave him a &s;heet of paper, and two quills; and told him to make pens of them if he could; one for him&s;elf, and the
<PB N="165" REF="166">
other for me; and to take the paper for his letter. He looked with intelligent &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;Where did they come from? was the que&s;tion in his thoughts; but he &s;aid nothing. Madmen were beings whom he did not comprehend.</P>
<P>My kindne&s;s to him, however, made him de&s;irous to oblige me. I gave him a part of my breakfa&s;t; and he ate what I gave him in a manner that &s;hewed he was not over-fed.</P>
<P>At dinner he brought me both the pens. I a&s;ked him why he did not keep one to write to his mother? He &s;aid he had written, but had cleaned and cut the pen over again. They were not ill made, con&s;idering that, as he told me, the knife was a bad one.</P>
<P>But what will you do for ink, &s;ir? &s;aid
<PB N="166" REF="167">
he. I told him I had a little; but that I &s;hould be glad if I had more. Perhaps, he replied, he could get one of the men to bring him a half|pennyworth. I &s;aid I had no money, and he an&s;wered a gentleman (Mr. Clif|ton, I &s;uppo&s;e) had ju&s;t given him &s;ix|pence, for holding his hor&s;e; that he intended to &s;ave it for his mother, but that he would &s;pare a halfpenny to buy me ink.</P>
<P>I took the boy's hand, and &s;aid to him&mdash;<Q>If ever I live to get free from this place, I will remember you.</Q>&mdash;The emotions I felt communicated them|&s;elves, and he looked &s;orrowfully up in my face, and a&s;ked&mdash;<Q>Why, are not you mad, &s;ir?</Q></P>
<P>The very earne&s;t but mild manner
<PB N="167" REF="168">
with which I an&s;wered&mdash;<Q>No, my good fellow</Q>&mdash;both convinced him and &s;et his imagination to work.</P>
<P>I &s;aid little more, but fini&s;hed my meal, wrote down my numbers, and gave him the bottle: but warned him, if he were que&s;tioned, by no means to tell an untruth. The boy looked at me again, in a manner that &s;poke highly in his fa|vour, put the bottle in his pocket, and, as &s;oon as his ma&s;ter returned to the door, removed the things and departed.</P>
<P>He brought the ink with my &s;upper. One of the men had taken his &s;ixpence, but refu&s;ed to return him any change; and the ink he had emptied out of the keeper's bottle. Such are the habits of vice. The boy related it with indigna|tion, but &s;aid he dared not complain.
<PB N="168" REF="169">
I had nothing el&s;e to give, I therefore re|warded the generous boy with a couple of quills, and four &s;heets of paper for his own u&s;e; cautioning him to keep them to write to his mother.</P>
<P>While I wanted the means, I imagined it would have been a great relief to have had the power of writing down my thoughts; but I found they were much too bu&s;y, and di&s;turbed, by the recol|lection of Anna St. Ives and her danger, and by the ince&s;&s;ant de&s;ire of finding &s;ome means of e&s;cape, notwith&s;tanding a thou&s;and repeated convictions of its impo&s;&s;ibility, to &s;uffer me to write either with effect or connection. I did nothing but make memorandums; &s;ome of thoughts that occurred, and others of circum&s;tances that were pre&s;ent. I con|cealed
<PB N="169" REF="170">
my papers in the wain&s;cot behind the picture, where I mean to leave this narrative.</P>
<P>The indulgence of my morning walk was continued; and on the &s;ixth day of my confinement an incident happened, by which I almo&s;t effected my relea&s;e.</P>
<P>Confiding in the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat and in the &s;trength of his locks and bars, and become le&s;s apprehen&s;ive from this per&s;ua&s;ion, the keeper had left me under the care of only one of his men; him&s;elf and the other were employed on &s;ome|thing which he wanted done in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>While they were ab&s;ent, the garden|bell rang. The voice of Mac Fane was heard, demanding entrance, by the man who was &s;et to watch me,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
and fetching the key he opened the gate without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>My hopes were in&s;tantly excited. I made a &s;hort turn and cro&s;&s;ed him, as if continuing my walk, a few yards di&s;tant from the gate. He eyed me however, and I went on; but, the moment he was bu&s;ied in unlocking and unbolting it, I turned round, &s;prang forward, and as it opened ru&s;hed pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The violence of my motion over&s;et Mac Fane. The ma&s;ter, who&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cions had taken the alarm, was entering the garden and &s;aw me. He and his man and Mac Fane in&s;tantly joined in the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Though I was in the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, yet I happened to be &s;wifter than any of them. The keeper was &s;oon the fir&s;t
<PB N="171" REF="172">
in the cha&s;e: it was up a narrow lane, with a high-banked hedge on each &s;ide. A man was coming down it, and the keeper called to him to &s;top me. The man &s;eeing my arms confined, and hear|ing the &s;houts of my pur&s;uers, endea|voured to do as he was de&s;ired. He placed him&s;elf directly in my way, and I ran full again&s;t him.</P>
<P>We both fell; but the man by the aid of his hands was up rather the &s;oone&s;t. He laid hold of me, and a &s;udden thought &s;truck me. They were bawling behind&mdash;"A madman! A madman!"&mdash;and I a&s;&s;umed that grinning contortion of countenance which might ea&s;ie&s;t ter|rify, uttered an uncouth noi&s;e, and be|gan to bite at the man. Terror &s;eized
<PB N="172" REF="173">
him, and I again got away, the very moment the keeper was coming up.</P>
<P>I had not run a hundred yards further before I &s;aw another man at a di&s;tance, and the hue and cry behind was as hot as ever. The hedge in this place was lower, and I jumped over it into the field on my right. There was a ditch on the other &s;ide, of which I had no in|timation; and my feet alighting on the edge of it, I once more fell.</P>
<P>My pur&s;uers profited by a gate, which I had pa&s;&s;ed. It was the field of a gar|dener, and a man was at work clo&s;e by. He came and helped me up; but not &s;oon enough: the keeper arrived, and pre&s;ently after his man and Mac Fane.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the gardener,
<PB N="173" REF="174">
endeavoured to tell him who I was, and &s;aid I would give him a hundred pounds, if he would aid me to e&s;cape: but my efforts were &s;oon put an end to by the keeper, who threw me down, a &s;econd time violently thru&s;t his thumb into my throat, and by gagging me prevented further &s;peech.</P>
<P>Mac Fane however thought proper to give the man half a crown, and they all a&s;&s;ured him I was a madman; which &s;tory was confirmed by the man who &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf bitten, and who had joined in the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The extreme malevolence of Mac Fane again di&s;played it&s;elf: but his treatment is unworthy notice, except as it relates to what is to come.</P>
<P>I was hurried back to my pri&s;on, left
<PB N="174" REF="175">
with the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat on that whole day and night, and was fed by the boy; who &s;hewed many &s;ilent tokens of com|mi&s;eration, though once more watched by the keeper and his two attendants, with the three chains up at the door. All conver&s;ations between me and the boy were for &s;everal days ended, by the con|tinued overlooking of the keeper and his men.</P>
<P>After the keeper and Mac Fane had retired, I went into the back room, and was &s;tanding with my face toward the window, which is be&s;ide the clo&s;et. The behaviour of Mac Fane had been &s;o ex|traordinary as already to lead me to &s;u&s;|pect he had a wi&s;h to take away my life.</P>
<P>As I was &s;tanding here, I heard the
<PB N="175" REF="176">
keeper's bed-room door open and &s;hut again, and &s;oon after the voices of him and Mac Fane in conver&s;ation. I li&s;|tened very attentively to a dialogue, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was to me much more alarming than unexpected. It was a con|&s;ultation, on the part of Mac Fane, on the policy and means of murdering me.</P>
<P>The keeper oppo&s;ed him, &s;everal times mentioned Mr. Clifton as an un|conquerable objection, and urged the danger of being detected; for he did not &s;eem to revolt at the fact.</P>
<P>Mac Fane an&s;wered he would &s;ilence Clifton; of whom his favourite phra&s;e was that "He &s;hould &s;oon do him!"&mdash;which he repeated very often, with a
<PB N="176" REF="177">
variety of uncommon oaths. He even &s;aid that, were I fairly out of the way, he could make Edward St. Ives pay him the three thou&s;and guineas.</P>
<P>The cur&s;es which Mac Fane continu|ally coupled with my name, and the rancour, the thir&s;t of blood which preyed upon him, were incredible. He a hun|dred times imprecated eternal damnation to his &s;oul if there were the lea&s;t danger. The fellows the keeper had with him were of his own providing: they knew he could hang them both: they dur&s;t not impeach. <HI>[Squeak,</HI> I recollect, was the word he u&s;ed.] To take me off was the &s;afe&s;t way. Clifton would in reality be an acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, and therefore obliged to &s;ilence. Be&s;ide&mdash;<Q>He would do him! He would do
<PB N="177" REF="178">
him!</Q>&mdash;This he confirmed by a new &s;tring of oaths.</P>
<P>The keeper however continued aver&s;e to the project, &s;aid the fellows would hang their own father if he could not bribe them, that there was nothing to be got by putting me out of the way, and that he would not venture his neck unle&s;s he &s;aw good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>While they were arguing the point, a loud and authoritative rap was heard at the keeper's door, accompanied by the voice of Mr. Clifton, demanding admi&s;|&s; on. He entered, and the whole &s;tory of my e&s;cape was related, with that co|louring which their own fears in&s;pired.</P>
<P>Mac Fane darkly hinted the thoughts he had been communicating to the keeper; but, meeting repul&s;e from Mr.
<PB N="178" REF="179">
Clifton whenever ideas of cruelty were &s;tarted, he thought proper to u&s;e more re&s;erve.</P>
<P>The keeper concluded his account by affirming it would be nece&s;&s;ary to conti|nue me in the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, and not to let me walk in the garden any more. Mr. Clifton a&s;&s;ented to the lat|ter, but po&s;itively ordered my arms to be relea&s;ed. There was no need he &s;aid to puni&s;h me in this manner, and it &s;hould not be. At the &s;ame time he gave the keeper a twenty pound note, and re|peated his orders to treat me properly, but to take care not to &s;uffer me to e&s;|cape.</P>
<P>Mi&s;guided man! How does your heart pant after virtue! How grieve at the &s;lavery in which it is held! What
<PB N="179" REF="180">
will its agony be, when the full mea&s;ure of error is come!</P>
<P>Yet this to me was the lucid moment of hope, for it &s;ugge&s;ted a train of conclu|&s;ions which &s;eem like heavenly certain|ties&mdash;Mr. Clifton has made his attempts on Anna St. Ives, and they have been repelled! Even &s;till, and it is &s;everal days &s;ince, his efforts continue to be in|effectual!&mdash;It mu&s;t be &s;o!&mdash;The pur|po&s;es of vice are fru&s;trated by the pure energies of virtue: for, had they &s;uc|ceeded, I &s;hould be relea&s;ed. Heart|cheering thought! Plea&s;ure inexpre&s;&s;i|ble! Yes, Anna St. Ives is &s;afe! Truth is omnipotent; and out of my a&s;hes another, and probably a more &s;tre|nuous and determined a&s;&s;ertor of it may ari&s;e! Clifton at la&s;t may &s;ee how very
<PB N="180" REF="181">
foul is folly, and turn to wi&s;dom! Would he might be &s;pared the guilt of pur|cha&s;ing conviction at the price of blood!</P>
<P>Three days pa&s;&s;ed away, after my e&s;|cape, without any remarkable occur|rence. The &s;anguinary malignity of Mac Fane was more than counterba|lanced, by the rea&s;onings of probabi|lity and hope in favour of Anna St. Ives.</P>
<P>During my confinement, I had &s;lept but little. Wearied however at length, by the repetition of ideas that were una|vailing, I was &s;lumbering more &s;oundly than u&s;ual on the night after the ninth day; and was dreaming that my doors were unbolted, the chains rattling, and men entering to murder me; from which
<PB N="181" REF="182">
I was waked by &s;tarting in my dream to run and re&s;i&s;t them. It was the real clanking of the bolts and locks of the hou&s;e doors that in&s;pired this dream; they opened to give &s;ome one admi&s;&s;ion. I know not what was the hour, but it mu&s;t be very late, and it was completely dark. I &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed Mac Fane's voice. I jumped up, ha&s;tily dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in part, and pre&s;ently heard the keeper's door open&mdash;The ray of light appeared on the wall&mdash;I crept toward the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t word Mac Fane uttered was&mdash;<Q>I told you I &s;hould do him!&mdash;I told you I &s;hould do him!</Q></P>
<P>He kept repeating this and other ex|clamations, which I could not at fir&s;t comprehend, clo&s;ing each of them with
<PB N="182" REF="183">
oaths expre&s;&s;ive of uncommon exul|tation. But he de&s;canted almo&s;t in|&s;tantly from Mr. Clifton, to whom his phra&s;e alluded, to me; adding&mdash;it was high time now to do me too.</P>
<P>His joy was &s;o great, his oaths &s;o multiplied&punc; and his a&s;&s;everations &s;o con|tinual, that he would tread me out, would &s;end my &s;oul to hell that very night, and other &s;imilar phra&s;es, that it was &s;ome time before the keeper could obtain an an&s;wer to his que&s;tion of&mdash;"What does all this mean?" At la&s;t Mr. Mac Fane began to relate, as &s;o|berly as the intoxication of his mind would permit, that he had done him [Mr. Clifton] out of ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Had he got the money?</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
No&mdash;But God &s;hiver his &s;oul to flames if he did not make him pay! He would blow him to powder, drink his blood, eat his bones if he did not!</P>
<P>This was not all&mdash;He had another prize! Eight thou&s;and pounds! The money was now in the hou&s;e!</P>
<P>He &s;topped &s;hort&mdash;The cupidity of the keeper was excited, and he grew impatient. Mac Fane I imagine he&s;i|tated to recon&s;ider if it were po&s;&s;ible to get all the money him&s;elf, make away with me &s;ecretly, and leave the keeper in ig|norance. But he could not but conclude this to be impracticable.</P>
<P>I could not &s;ufficiently connect the meaning of all the phra&s;es that followed; they might depend as much on &s;eeing as
<PB N="184" REF="185">
hearing; but I under&s;tood Mac Fane was acquainted with the circum&s;tance of the money I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; though whether his knowledge were gained from Mr. Clifton or Anna St. Ives, for they were both mentioned, I could not di&s;tingui&s;h. He talked much of a letter, of his own cunning, and of the contempt in which he held Mr. Clifton.</P>
<P>The keeper however was convinced of the fact, for he propo&s;ed imme|diately to murder me, and &s;ecure the money.</P>
<P>This point was for &s;ome time debated, and I every moment expected they would leave the room, to perpetrate the crime. Mac Fane had his pi&s;tols and cutla&s;s, yet &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e a po&s;&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="185" REF="186">
even of my conquering them. The keeper was much more confident&mdash;<Q>He knew how to bring me down; he had no fear of that.</Q>&mdash;Mac Fane remembered his defeat, and the keeper his cheaply bought victory.</P>
<P>They agreed it could not be done &s;i|lently, unle&s;s they could catch me a&s;leep, and the unbolting of the doors would awaken me. They wi&s;hed the keeper's fellows to know nothing of the matter; they would claim their &s;hare.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Mac Fane propo&s;ed that I &s;hould be put in the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat the next morning, on pretence of walk|ing me out in the garden; that perhaps it would be be&s;t to &s;uffer me to walk there, but not to take off the &s;trait
<PB N="186" REF="187">
wai&s;tcoat any more; that then the doors might be left unbolted, and even un|locked, my arms being confined; and the next night they might come and di&s;patch me!</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation continued long after this, and &s;chemes of flight, either to Ireland or the continent, were concerted, and the riches and happine&s;s they &s;hould enjoy in&s;i&s;ted on, with great &s;elf|applau&s;e and plea&s;ure. Poor, mi&s;taken men!</P>
<P>They at la&s;t parted, with a determi|nation to execute the &s;cheme of the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat. Mac Fane took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the keeper's bed; and he as I imagine went to that of his men.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">
And here I mu&s;t remark that Mac Fane either forgot or did not imagine that my immediate murder would be an impediment to the payment of the ten thou&s;and pound gaming debt, from Mr. Clifton; which fear afterward ac|tuated him &s;trongly. It could not do otherwi&s;e, the moment it was con|ceived.</P>
<P>According to agreement, in the morn|ing the keeper came, with as much pretended kindne&s;s as he knew how to a&s;&s;ume, to tell me I might have my walk in the garden again, if I plea&s;ed. I an|&s;wered I did not wi&s;h to walk. He en|deavoured to per&s;uade me, but he &s;oon found it was to no purpo&s;e. He then ordered the boy away, who had brought
<PB N="188" REF="189">
the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, and quitted his &s;tation at the door in great dudgeon.</P>
<P>I &s;oon afterward heard, as I expected, Mac Fane and him in his own room. Mac Fane cur&s;ed the keeper bitterly, and &s;uppo&s;ed that, for want of cunning, he had in part betrayed him&s;elf, and ren|dered me &s;u&s;picious. The keeper re|&s;ented his behaviour and cur&s;ed again, till I imagined they had fairly quar|relled.</P>
<P>Mac Fane however began to cool, and to talk of another expedient of which he had been thinking. This was to poi|&s;on me. In this the keeper immediately joined, and began to enquire about the means of procuring the poi&s;on. The boy was fir&s;t mentioned, but that was
<PB N="189" REF="190">
thought too dangerous. At la&s;t Mac Fane determined him&s;elf to go to Lon|don and buy ar&s;enic, on pretence of poi&s;oning rats, and to &s;et off immedi|ately. On this they concluded, and pre|&s;ently left the room.</P>
<P>My whole attention was now employ|ed in watching the opening of the keep|er's door; but there was rea&s;on to ap|prehend they would conver&s;e &s;omewhere el&s;e on their projects. I imagine how|ever they thought this the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible place, for a little be|fore dark I again heard the voice of Mac Fane, and they pre&s;ently came back to their former &s;tation.</P>
<P>Mac Fane related the difficulty he had found in getting the ar&s;enic; that &s;eve|ral &s;hops had refu&s;ed him; and that at
<PB N="190" REF="191">
la&s;t he had &s;ucceeded by ordering a quantity of drugs, for which he paid, leaving them to be &s;ent to a fictitious addre&s;s, and returning back pretending he wanted &s;ome poi&s;on for the rats, a&s;king them which was the be&s;t. They recommended ar&s;enic, which they di|rected him to make up in balls, and he ordered a quarter of a pound. They weighed it, he put it in his pocket, and they noticed the circum&s;tance, telling him they would &s;end it home with the other drugs; but he walked away pre|tending not to hear what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>Mac Fane, glorying in his own cun|ning, was impatient to admini&s;ter his drug, and propo&s;ed it &s;hould be &s;ent up in my tea. The keeper a&s;&s;ented, and the boy very &s;oon afterward brought me
<PB N="191" REF="192">
&s;ome tea in a pot ready made, contrary to cu&s;tom, I having been u&s;ed to make my own tea.</P>
<P>The keeper was at the door. I a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of this deviation; and he bade me drink my tea and be thankful. I poured &s;ome out, fir&s;t looked at it, then ta&s;ted it, and afterwards threw it into the a&s;hes, &s;aying it was bad tea. I next examined the tea-pot, &s;melled into it, and then da&s;hed it to pieces on the hearth. I looked toward the keeper and told him there was &s;omething in the tea that ought not to have been.</P>
<P>Seeing me take up the candle and begin to move, he in&s;tantly &s;hut the door. His con&s;cience was alarmed, and for a moment he forgot the &s;ecurity of his chains. He even called up his
<PB N="192" REF="193">
men before he opened it again; after which the boy was relea&s;ed, but not be|fore I had time to tell him never to eat any thing that was brought for me. The poor boy noticed the &s;ignificance with which I &s;aid it, and fixed his eyes mournfully upon me. I &s;hook him by the hand, bade him be a good boy, and not learn wickedne&s;s from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The remains of the tea-&s;et were &s;oon removed, and a fre&s;h con&s;ultation pre|&s;ently began in the keeper's room. Mac Fane was again enraged, and blamed the keeper; who began to &s;uppo&s;e there was &s;omething &s;upernatural in my beha|viour. He &s;aid I looked at him as if I knew it was poi&s;on, and it was very &s;trange! Mac Fane &s;wore he would do&s;e me at &s;upper, and would go and make
<PB N="193" REF="194">
me eat it him&s;elf, or blow my brains out; but he pre&s;ently recollected I had not the &s;trait wai&s;tcoat on, and altered his tone. It was hoever agreed that an|other attempt &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>I now began to con&s;ider all circum|&s;tances; whether it were probable, if I ate a little, that the keeper &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e it only a temporary want of ap|petite; what quantity might be eaten without harm, and if it were not practi|cable to watch the moment when they &s;hould come, by night, to execute their wicked purpo&s;e, and to pa&s;s them and e&s;cape? A little rea&s;oning &s;hewed me that I &s;hould be in the dark, in a hou&s;e the avenues to which were all &s;ecured, and with which I was unacquainted; that the number I had to contend with
<PB N="194" REF="195">
now would be four, three of them pro|vided with bludgeons, and the fourth with a hanger and pi&s;tols; that relea&s;e by the order of Mr. Clifton was not im|po&s;&s;ible; and that, if I began a fray, I &s;hould excite cowardice to action; and, having begun, Mac Fane would &s;carcely mi&s;s &s;uch an opportunity.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons made me rather re&s;olve to per&s;evere in fa&s;ting; which remedy, though it could not be of long duration, appeared to be the wi&s;e&s;t. Yet caution was nece&s;&s;ary, for, &s;hould I make them ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of poi&s;oning me, they would have recour&s;e to other means.</P>
<P>My re&s;olution was taken, and when the &s;upper came I ta&s;ted a bit of bread and drank a &s;mall quantity of water, after carefully in&s;pecting it, and without
<PB N="195" REF="196">
&s;aying any thing more &s;ent the re&s;t away.</P>
<P>The keeper's door &s;oon opened, the ray of light appeared on the wall, and a new con&s;ultation &s;ucceeded. The keeper again was troubled with &s;uper&s;ti|tious fears; and Mac Fane was per|&s;uaded that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aving been alarmed at tea|time, I had from &s;u&s;picion refu&s;ed to eat any &s;upper.</P>
<P>After a debate, they concluded it would be in vain to attempt to poi&s;on me in my tea, for I &s;hould detect it: they would therefore &s;end me a &s;hort al|lowance at breakfa&s;t, keep me hungry, and prepare my dinner for the next day. The keeper propo&s;ed to give me n&oacute; breakfa&s;t, but Mac Fane &s;aid that was the way to make me &s;u&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197">
They were both highly chagrined; but Mac Fane was much the mo&s;t talka|tive at all times, and the loude&s;t in oaths and menaces: though I &s;carcely think even him a more dangerous man than the keeper.</P>
<P>In the morning, ob&s;erving they had &s;ent agreeable to their plan a &s;mall quantity, after a little examination I ate what was brought me, and the keeper retired apparently &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>It was far otherwi&s;e at dinner, when I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to eat; and their vex|ation was greatly increa&s;ed by my per|&s;i&s;ting to refu&s;e the whole day.</P>
<P>Late at night a new council was held, and it was long in debate whether I &s;hould be &s;uffered to live the night out. At la&s;t the cupidity of Mac Fane pre|vailed,
<PB N="197" REF="198">
and his fear of not getting Mr. Clifton's bond for eleven thou&s;and pounds, as he &s;aid, though I under&s;tood he had won but ten, &s;eems now to have fir&s;t &s;truck him; and this induced him to de&s;i&s;t. I under&s;tood however that Mac Fane had &s;till &s;ome hopes from his poi|&s;on, and con&s;equently that to fa&s;t would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Their final re&s;olve was that, the mo|ment Mr. Clifton &s;hould have given Mac Fane the bond, they would then delay no longer: and, from the threats which he vaunted of having u&s;ed, he expected the bond to be given the next day, when Mr. Clifton was to come to the keeper's, if I under&s;tood them rightly, after his vi&s;it to Anna St. Ives.</P>
<P>This idea again conjured up torturing
<PB N="198" REF="199">
images, and fears which no efforts I have been able to make can entirely appea&s;e.</P>
<P>I began this narrative the fir&s;t day on which I found my life was in danger, and have continued it to this time, which is now the twelfth day of my confine|ment. The de&s;ire which the keeper expre&s;&s;es to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the money convinces me of my great jeopardy. He was eager to have committed the murder la&s;t night, during the la&s;t con|ver&s;ation I heard. That I &s;hould e&s;cape with life from the hands of the&s;e wicked men is but little probable; but I will not de&s;ert my&s;elf; I will not forward an act of blood by timidity. Were I to de&s;troy the bank-bills, and to tell them they were de&s;troyed, I &s;hould not be be|lieved.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<P>OH my friend! I am e&s;caped! Have broken my pri&s;on and am &s;itting now&mdash;I cannot tell you where, but in a place of &s;afety. I have been thus &s;ucce&s;sful by the aid of Laura.</P>
<P>It is now four days &s;ince I &s;aw your brother. Lulled to &s;ecurity by the peace|able
<PB N="201" REF="202">
manner in which I had &s;ubmitted to confinement, and imagining Laura to be &s;till in the intere&s;t of Mr. Clifton, though this &s;illy girl is now a very &s;incere penitent, the old woman began to indulge her in &s;till greater liberties. I warned Laura very &s;eriou&s;ly again&s;t any precipitate at|tempts, for I &s;aw it was probable this in|cautiou&s;ne&s;s would increa&s;e, provided it were encouraged.</P>
<P>No good opportunity offered till this morning, when Laura was &s;uffered to take the key of my pri&s;on chamber, and let her&s;elf in and out.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he told me of it I en|quired what other ob&s;tacles there were. Laura &s;aid we might get into the yard, but no further, for there was a high wall which no woman could climb. I a&s;ked
<PB N="202" REF="203">
her if &s;he thought a man could climb it? She an&s;wered, yes, &s;he had &s;een men do &s;uch things, but &s;he could not think how.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence of Mr. Clifton for &s;o long a time, without relea&s;ing me from my impri&s;onment, made me in hourly expec|tation of his return. I therefore did not &s;tay to he&s;itate, but de&s;ired Laura to &s;teal down &s;tairs before me, and open the door, for that I was determined to at|tempt the wall.</P>
<P>Laura was terrified at the fear of being left behind, for &s;he &s;aid &s;he never could climb it. <Q>Alas! What was to be|come of her?</Q>&mdash;I told her &s;he &s;hould have thought of con&s;equences long ago; but that &s;he might be certain I would not de&s;ert her: on the contrary, I would
<PB N="203" REF="204">
go to the fir&s;t hou&s;e I could find and &s;end her relief, if I &s;hould happen to climb a wall which &s;he could not. Though, I likewi&s;e added, it was weak|ne&s;s and folly to &s;uppo&s;e that men were better able to climb walls than women, or that &s;he could not follow, if I could lead.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;urance of relief in part qui|eted her fears: &s;he opened the fir&s;t door, &s;tole down to the &s;econd, I fol|lowed, &s;he unlocked it, and we both got into the yard.</P>
<P>The wall as &s;he &s;aid was high and not ea&s;ily climbed; but I had little time for reflection: the old woman &s;aw us through the window, and was coming.</P>
<P>To this wall there was a gate, equally high, but with a handle to &s;hut, ledges
<PB N="204" REF="205">
running acro&s;s, and two or three cracked places that afforded hold for the hand. You and I, Loui&s;a, have often di&s;cour&s;ed on the excellence of active courage, and the much greater efforts of which both &s;exes are capable than either of them imagine. I climbed the gate with great &s;peed and little difficulty.</P>
<P>The old woman was already in the yard, and Laura &s;tood wondering to &s;ee me on the top of the wall, fearing I &s;hould now break my neck in getting down again, and &s;till in greater terror at the approach of the old woman. I made &s;ome attempt to per&s;uade the latter to give Laura her liberty; but our turnkey is very deaf, and in&s;tead of li&s;tening to me &s;he ran for &s;ome offen&s;ive weapon to beat me off the wall: &s;o, once more a&s;|&s;uring
<PB N="205" REF="206">
Laura I would &s;end her immediate aid, and keeping hold of the gate po&s;t with my hand, I let my&s;elf down and with very little hurt.</P>
<P>I proceeded along a narrow lane; I knew not in what direction, but hurried forward in great ha&s;te; not only from the po&s;&s;ibility of being pur&s;ued, but be|cau&s;e it began to blow and rain very hea|vily. In le&s;s than ten minutes I came to a hou&s;e: I rang, a man came to the gate, and I readily gained admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was &s;hewn into the room where I am now writing, and another per&s;on was &s;ent to me, who perhaps is the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, though from his appearance I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e the contrary. I a&s;ked fir&s;t if it were po&s;&s;ible to get a coach; and he enquired where I came
<PB N="206" REF="207">
from? I told him, from a hou&s;e at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, in the &s;ame lane, where I had been forcibly &s;hut up, and where my maid &s;till was, whom I wi&s;hed to have relea&s;ed; adding I would well reward any two men, by whom it might ea&s;ily be effected, if they would go and help her over the wall.</P>
<P>He li&s;tened very attentively, &s;tood &s;ome time to con&s;ider, and then replied there was no coach to be procured within a mile of the place, but that a man &s;hould go for one; and that I might make my&s;elf ea&s;y concerning the young woman (Laura) for &s;he &s;hould &s;oon join me. The look and manner of the man did not plea&s;e me, but the ca&s;e was urgent, the &s;torm increa&s;ing, and I in want of &s;helter and protection.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
I then recollected it would perhaps be &s;afe&s;t to write immediately to Gro&s;venor-Street, to prevent &s;urpri&s;e as well as to guard again&s;t accidents, and I a&s;ked if he could furni&s;h me with a &s;heet of paper and pen and ink. He an&s;wered he feared not, but called a boy, and &s;aid to him&mdash;<Q>Did not I &s;ee you with &s;ome writing paper the other day?</Q> The boy an&s;wered yes; and he bade him go and fetch it, and bring me the pen and ink.</P>
<P>He then left me, and the boy pre&s;ently returned, with a &s;heet of paper, an old ink-bottle, and a very indifferent pen. The boy looked at me earne&s;tly, and then examined the pen, &s;aying it was a very bad one, but he would fetch me a better.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">
The man who was ju&s;t gone had told me that nobody could be &s;pared, to go as far as I required, in le&s;s than an hour at the &s;oone&s;t; I therefore have time to write at length.</P>
<P>I think there can be little doubt but that my Loui&s;a is long before this in Gro&s;venor-Street. I would not wi&s;h Sir Arthur to be informed too &s;uddenly, I will therefore direct to her at a venture; but for fear of accidents will add to the direction&mdash;<Q>If Mi&s;s Clifton be not there, to be opened and read by Mrs. Clarke.</Q>&mdash;In the pre&s;ent alarmed &s;tate of the family this will en&s;ure its being opened, even if both my good friends &s;hould be ab&s;ent.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you my &s;incere thanks, dear madam, for your kind congratulations; and think my&s;elf honoured by the great joy you expre&s;s, at my &s;afety and the deliver|ance of Mr. Henley. I will not attempt to de&s;cribe my own feelings; they are in|expre&s;&s;ible;
<PB N="220" REF="221">
but will endeavour to obey your commands, and give you the be&s;t account I am able of all that has befallen us.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I inclo&s;e the narra|tive written by Mr. Henley during his confinement; and three letters addre&s;&s;ed to my friend, Loui&s;a, but never &s;ent; with a copy of a letter dictated by Mr. Clifton to his friend, Mr. Fairfax. To the&s;e be plea&s;ed to add the following particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed after Mr. Henley's narrative breaks off, and the &s;udden interruption of my third letter by terror.</P>
<P>Mr. Henley heard but had not time to write their la&s;t con&s;ultation. It was the eagerne&s;s of the keeper which over|came the reluctance of Mac Fane to
<PB N="221" REF="222">
the murder, till he &s;hould have procured the bond of Mr. Clifton. The keeper was violent: he had bargained with his two men to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the murder, for fifty pounds each; and he told Mac Fane, if he would not con&s;ent, they would pro|ceed without him, and he &s;hould have no &s;hare of the eight thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This argument had its effect: Mac Fane had &s;ome doubts relative to the money won of Mr. Clifton; and four thou&s;and pounds was a temptation not to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mr. Henley omitted mentioning a circum&s;tance that occurred of &s;ome mo|ment, becau&s;e he did not know the meaning of it. Probably they had planned it out of his hearing. The day before the attack, the keeper returned
<PB N="222" REF="223">
him his watch and pur&s;e, with the &s;ame &s;um, but not, as Mr. Henley thinks, the &s;ame pieces, it contained when de|livered. The purpo&s;e of this, it appears, was to make him believe the keeper a man of his word.</P>
<P>On the morning of the intended mur|der, previous to the a&s;&s;ault, the keeper came up to Mr. Henley; but not into the room. He talked to him with the u&s;ual &s;ecurity of his chains, and pro|po&s;ed that Mr. Henley &s;hould deliver up the bank-bills, which the keeper now told him he knew to be in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; with a promi&s;e that they &s;hould be re|turned, as the watch and pur&s;e had been.</P>
<P>An artifice &s;o &s;hallow was not likely to impo&s;e on Mr. Henley. He had de|termined how to act, relative to the bank
<PB N="223" REF="224">
bills, and an&s;wered it was true they were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but that he would not deliver them to the keeping of any other. Immediately after this repul&s;e, the keep|er, Mac Fane, and the two attendants a&s;cended.</P>
<P>The keeper (I &s;peak after Mr. Henley) was much the mo&s;t confident, and &s;eem|ed chiefly fearful that Mr. Henley &s;hould &s;lip by them. He therefore &s;tationed one of his men at the out&s;ide of the door, which he ordered him to lock and guard. Him&s;elf, Mac Fane, and the other entered the room; the keeper and the man each with a bludgeon, and Mac Fane with a pair of pi&s;tols and his cutla&s;s hanging by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mr. Henley had purpo&s;ely kept up a good fire, and had the bank bills in
<PB N="224" REF="225">
his hand. He bade them keep off a moment, as if he wi&s;hed to parley; and they, de&s;irous of having the bills quietly, remained where they were. Mr. Hen|ley then took the bills one by one, re|peating the amount of each to convince them that the whole &s;um was there, and then &s;uddenly thru&s;t them into the fire. They all ru&s;hed forward to &s;ave them, and this was the lucky moment on which Mr. Henley &s;eized the two arms of Mac Fane, who, on account of his weapons, was the principal object, and who, in|tending to fire at him, in the &s;truggle &s;hot the keeper. The other pi&s;tol Mr. Henley wre&s;ted from him, during which conte&s;t it went off, but without doing mi&s;chief.</P>

Mac Fane then drew his hanger, and made &s;everal cuts at Mr. Henley, who was attacked on the other &s;ide by the keeper's man.</P>
<P>In the heat of this conflict Mr. Clif|ton arrived; and what then followed, his letter will inform you.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould now &s;ay a word of my&s;elf, and of the &s;mall part which I had in this very dreadful affair. And here I mu&s;t remind you of the boy, &s;o often mentioned in Mr. Henley's nar|rative; for to him, perhaps, we all owe our &s;afety. At lea&s;t, had it not been for him, Mr. Clifton could not certainly have gained admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The poor fellow heard and &s;aw enough to let him under&s;tand &s;ome &s;trange crime was in agitation. He has great acute|ne&s;s
<PB N="226" REF="227">
and &s;en&s;ibility: he looked at me when I fir&s;t came, in a very &s;ignificant manner; and would have &s;poken had he dared.</P>
<P>The door of the room in which I was &s;hut was both locked and bolted; but the man that was &s;et to guard it was wanted, for a more blood-thir&s;ty purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I need not inform you how much my fears were alarmed, the moment I found my&s;elf in the cu&s;tody of the man by whom I had at fir&s;t been &s;eized. But how infinitely was my terror increa&s;ed when I heard the voice of Frank, which I did very di&s;tinctly, and pre&s;ently after|ward of the horror about to be com|mitted! My &s;hrieks were ince&s;&s;ant! The poor boy heard them, and though &s;hrieking with terror almo&s;t as violent as
<PB N="227" REF="228">
my own, yet had the pre&s;ence of mind to come and &s;et me free.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifton's ringing was heard at the &s;ame moment. The top bolt of the gate was high, and I opened it with dif|ficulty; but de&s;pair lent me force. It certainly could not have been opened time enough by the boy.</P>
<P>Of this and the following &s;cene, and of the agonizing &s;en&s;ations that accom|panied them, I will attempt no further de&s;cription. I will now only relate by what means, and who&s;e aid, we left this hou&s;e of horror.</P>
<P>You know, madam, with what activity my dear Loui&s;a exerted her&s;elf, and em|ployed every expedient in her power. You are likewi&s;e acquainted with the zeal of Mrs. Clarke, her niece Peggy,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
and the two men, her hu&s;band and bro|ther. Their ardour increa&s;ed rather than abated.</P>
<P>Mr. Webb, who&s;e watchings and ef|forts were ince&s;&s;ant, &s;aw Mac Fane &s;tep out of a hackney-coach into the &s;hop where Mr. Clifton lodges. This I un|der&s;tand to have happened on the ninth evening of my confinement. It was na|tural that this circum&s;tance &s;hould im|mediately excite &s;u&s;picion and alarm. The coach was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, Mac Fane re|mained, and Mr. Webb continued ho|vering about the door, waiting in expect|ation of &s;eeing him come out, till two o'clock in the morning, but waiting in vain: after which, concluding that he had mi&s;&s;ed him, he quitted his po&s;t.</P>
<P>On the morrow, by very diligent en|quiry,
<PB N="229" REF="230">
he found out Mac Fane's lodg|ings; but he had not been at home all night. The &s;ame ineffectual &s;earch was continued during that and the next day; but, on the morning of deliverance, Mr. Webb met a per&s;on with whom he had formerly been acquainted, who told him of the hou&s;e hired by the keeper, and mentioned the names of his two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, with rumours and &s;urmi&s;es &s;ufficiently dark and unintelligible, but enough to make Mr. Webb &s;uppo&s;e it was po&s;|&s;ible the per&s;ons he was in &s;earch of were there confined.</P>
<P>The intelligence was immediately brought to Loui&s;a and Sir Arthur, and application as immediately made to the magi&s;tracy. Webb had obtained very accurate information of the &s;ite of
<PB N="230" REF="231">
the hou&s;e; and, what was more effectual, had prevailed on his informer to lend his aid.</P>
<P>The relief he brought, though too late to prevent mi&s;chief, was not wholly u&s;ele&s;s; Mr. Clifton was the fir&s;t object of our care; for Mr. Henley, though brui&s;ed, cut, and mangled, has received no &s;erious injury. Laura was likewi&s;e &s;ent for and relieved from her pri&s;on. Proper conveyances were &s;oon provided, and we all removed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible from this &s;cene of horror.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure, madam, we did not forget to bring the boy with us. Mr. Henley has an affection for him, which the poor fellow very &s;incerely returns; and finds him&s;elf relieved from the mo&s;t
<PB N="231" REF="232">
mi&s;erable of &s;ituations, and placed in the mo&s;t happy.</P>
<P>That I may wholly acquit my&s;elf of the ta&s;k I have undertaken, I mu&s;t ju&s;t mention the Count de Beaunoir. He is a gentleman of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant tem|per. Urbanity is his di&s;tinctive mark, for in this quality mo&s;t of his flights originate. He has thought him&s;elf my admirer, but in reality he is the general admirer of whatever he &s;uppo&s;es excel|lent. When he was told of my being affianced to Mr. Henley, in&s;tead of ex|pre&s;&s;ing chagrin, he broke into raptures at our mutual happine&s;s, and how much it was merited. He does not &s;eem to under&s;tand the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Perhaps, madam, you have not heard the la&s;t accounts of the phy&s;ical gentle|men,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
relative to Mr. Clifton. The &s;ur|geon who fir&s;t gave hope is now po&s;itive of a cure; and his opponents begin to own it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but they will not yet allow that Mr. Clifton is out of danger.</P>
<P>The Count de Beaunoir has paid Mr. Clifton the utmo&s;t attention; he vi&s;its him twice a day, and, according to the accounts my friend gives me, infu&s;es a &s;pirit of benevolence and affection into his vi&s;its which are highly honourable to his heart. Indeed I and Mr. Henley have &s;everal times met him there: for you may well imagine, madam, we are not the lea&s;t attentive of Mr. Clifton's vi&s;itors. It is at pre&s;ent the &s;ole &s;tudy of Mr. Henley, which way be&s;t to ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf to a heart and under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="233" REF="234">
&s;o capable of generous &s;en&s;ations, and noble energies. There is an at|tachment to con&s;i&s;tency in the human mind, which will not admit of any &s;ud|den and ab&s;olute change; it mu&s;t be gradual: but thus much may with cer|tainty be &s;aid, Mr. Clifton does not at pre&s;ent, and I hope will never again, treat with complacency tho&s;e vindictive but erroneous notions which had &s;o nearly proved de&s;tructive to all. He makes no profe&s;&s;ions; but &s;o much the better; he thinks them the more &s;trongly. His mind pre&s;erves its u&s;ual tone; is &s;ometimes di&s;turbed even to exce&s;s, and bitterly angry, almo&s;t to phren&s;y, at its own mi&s;takes; but has lo&s;t none of tho&s;e quick and powerful qualities, by which it is &s;o highly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
Sir Arthur, madam, has de&s;ired me to communicate a circum&s;tance, which I &s;hall readily do, without the fal&s;e deli|cacy of &s;uppo&s;ing that I am not the pro|per per&s;on. It is agreed, between him and Mr. Abimelech Henley, that the marriage between me and Mr. Frank Henley &s;hall take place in a month; to which I thought it my duty to a&s;&s;ent. I am &s;orry, madam, that Lord Fitz-Allen &s;hould continue to imagine his honour will be &s;ullied by this marriage: but I am in like manner &s;orry for a thou&s;and follies, which I daily &s;ee in the world, without having the immediate power of correcting one of them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW violent and reiterated are the conflicts, between truth and error, in every mind of ardour!&mdash;And, of all errors, the love of &s;elf is the mo&s;t rooted, the lea&s;t ea&s;y to detect, and &s;u|premely difficult to eradicate. We
<PB N="243" REF="244">
can pardon our&s;elves any thing, except a want of &s;elf-re&s;pect; but that is into|lerable.</P>
<P>I de&s;cribed, in my la&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Omitted.</NOTE>, the di&s;&s;a|tisfied &s;tate of mind of Mr. Clifton. But, while he imagined he &s;hould die and &s;oon lo&s;e all memory of a &s;cene be|come &s;o irk&s;ome to him, his di&s;&s;atisfac|tion was trifling, compared to what it is at pre&s;ent. Repugnant as the idea was to his habitual feelings, &s;till I have more than half convinced him that &s;ui|cide is an act as cowardly as it is cri|minal. Yet to live and face the world, loaded as he imagines with unpar|donable crimes and everla&s;ting igno|miny, is a thing to which he knows not
<PB N="244" REF="245">
how to con&s;ent. To combat this new mi&s;take, into which he has fallen, has for &s;ome time pa&s;t been my chief em|ployment. No common efforts could a&s;&s;uage the turbulence of his tempe&s;|tuous &s;oul. Energy &s;uperior even to his own was nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;ubject and calm this perturbation. But, in the &s;implicity of truth, this energy was ea&s;y to be found: it is from &s;elf-di&s;tru&s;t, confu&s;ion or cowardice, if it ever fail.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t left him, and our conver|&s;ation will give you the be&s;t hi&s;tory of his mind, which is well worthy our &s;tudy. I found him verging even toward delirium, and a fever coming on, which if not impeded might &s;oon be fatal. He keeps his bed; but in&s;tead of lying at his ea&s;e, he remained rai&s;ed on his el|bow,
<PB N="245" REF="246">
having ju&s;t fini&s;hed a letter to his friend. Loui&s;a had de&s;cribed the &s;tate of his mind, and I re&s;olved to catch its tone, that I might the more certainly command his attention. Without pre|face, and as if continuing a chain of rea|&s;oning, he addre&s;&s;ed me; with his eye fixed, in all the ardour of enquiry.</P>
<P>What is man?&mdash;What are his func|tions, qualities, and u&s;es?&mdash;Does he not &s;leep trembling, live envying, and die cur&s;ing?&mdash;And is this worth aught?&mdash;Is it to be endured?&mdash;Why do I &s;uffer life thus to be impo&s;ed upon me?</P>
<P>It is not &s;uffering: or, if it be, &s;uch &s;ufferings are of our own creation&mdash;To the virtuous and the wi&s;e, life is joy and bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o&mdash;Wi&s;dom there may be,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
and truth and virtue. And, for the vir|tuous and the wi&s;e, the full &s;tream of plea&s;ure may richly flow: but not for me! Pretend not that I may walk with the gods! I who have been the inmate of fiends! I, who propo&s;ed glory to my&s;elf from the mo&s;t contemptible of pur&s;uits! I, who could dangle after co|quettes and prudes; feed on and inflate my&s;elf with the baubles of a beauty's toilette; and, in the book of vanity, in&s;cribe my&s;elf a great hero, a mighty conqueror, for having heaped ridicule on the ridiculous; or brought innocence to &s;hame, mi&s;ery, and de&s;truction! And this I did with a light and vain heart! Did it laughing, boa&s;ting, exulting! Satanic dog! Pe&s;t of hell! What! Stretch &s;ouls on the rack, and then girn
<PB N="247" REF="248">
and mock at them for lying there! 'Tis the &s;port of devils, and by devils in|vented!</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent indignation is honour|able both to your heart and under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Oh, flatter me not!&mdash;Vain, &s;uperci|lious coxcomb!&mdash;I &s;pread my wings, crowed in conceit, threatened, re&s;olved, laughed at oppo&s;ition, and kicked the world before me!&mdash;Oh, it was who but I!&mdash;And what was it I propo&s;ed?&mdash;Fair conque&s;t?&mdash;Honourable oppo&s;ition?&mdash;No!&mdash;It was treachery, covert malice, and cowardly con&s;piracy!&mdash;A league with hell-dogs!&mdash;Horrible, blood-thir&s;ty villains!&mdash;And baffled too; defeated, after all this infernal enginery! Nay, had I been &s;o wholly devil as to have
<PB N="248" REF="249">
joined in murder, what would have followed? Why they would next have murdered me; and for the ju&s;tice of the &s;econd murder would have hoped par|don, even for the hell-born guilt of the fir&s;t!</P>
<P>Do not, while you dete&s;t and &s;hun one crime, plunge into a greater. This agony is for having been unju&s;t to others; you are now &s;till more unju&s;t to your&s;elf. You will not &s;uppo&s;e your|&s;elf capable of a &s;ingle virtue: yet, in your mo&s;t mi&s;taken moments, you never could be &s;o illiberal to your enemies.</P>

<P>I will an&s;wer when you are more calm.</P>

<P>There is no need; you have a &s;oul already; inventive, capacious, munifi|cent, &s;ublime!</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258">
Ay, ay&mdash;I know&mdash;You have a choice collection of words.</P>
<P>A &s;oul of ten thou&s;and! Nay, an army of &s;ouls in one!</P>
<P>And mu&s;t I &s;ubmit? Are you deter|mined to make a ra&s;cal like me admire, and love, and give place to all the fine affections of the heart?</P>
<P>Ay, determined!</P>
<P>Oh, &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;(Loui&s;a at this moment entered.) To you too I have behaved like a &s;coundrel! A tyrant! A pe|tulant, o&s;tentatious, imperious brag|gart!</P>
<P>You mi&s;take! replied Loui&s;a, eager|ly. You mi&s;take! You are talking of a very different man! A being I could not under&s;tand. You are my brother!
<PB N="258" REF="259">
&mdash;My brother!&mdash;I have found the way to your heart! Will make it all my own! Will twine my&s;elf round it! Shake me off if you can!</P>
<P>The energy with which &s;he &s;poke, and looked, and ki&s;&s;ed him, was irre&s;i&s;tible! He was overpowered: the tears gu&s;hed to his eyes, but he repre&s;&s;ed them; he thought them unmanly; and, &s;eeing his medical friend enter, exclaimed&mdash;I have &s;urgeons for the body, and &s;urgeons for the mind, who cut with &s;o deep yet &s;o &s;teady a hand that they take away the noxious, and leave the &s;ound to &s;uppurate and heal!</P>
<P>Can we do le&s;s? &s;aid I. Ours is no common ta&s;k! We are acting in behalf of &s;ociety: we have found a trea&s;ure,
<PB N="259" REF="260">
by which it is to be enriched. Few in|deed are tho&s;e pui&s;&s;ant and heavenly endowed &s;pirits, that are capable of guiding, enlightening, and leading the human race onward to felicity! What is there precious but mind? And when mind, like a diamond of uncommon growth, exceeds a certain magnitude, calculation cannot find its value!</P>
<P>I once more left him; and never did I quit the company of human being, no not of Anna St. Ives her&s;elf, with a more glowing and hoping heart. But why de&s;cribe &s;en&s;ations to thee, Oliver, with which thou art &s;o intimately ac|quainted? To bid thee rejoice, to in|vite thee to participate in felicity, which may and mu&s;t &s;o widely diffu&s;e it&s;elf,

were equally to wrong thy under&s;tand|ing and thy heart.</P>
