<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO THE DECLARATION OF THE GENERAL CONGRESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Independent States take up arms, they endeavour to impre&s;s the World with a favourable opinion of their own cau&s;e, and to lay the blame of ho&s;tilities on the in|ju&s;tice of their Opponents. But if Nations, ac|countable to none for their conduct, deem it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to reconcile others to their proceedings, the nece&s;&s;ity is &s;till more urgent with regard to tho&s;e who, breaking through every political duty, draw their &s;words again&s;t the State of which they own them&s;elves the Subjects. The opinions of man|kind are invariably oppo&s;ed to &s;uch men. Their a&s;&s;ertions are heard with di&s;tru&s;t, their arguments
<PB N="2" REF="3">
weighed with caution; and, therefore, it is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary for THEM to adhere to truth, in the former, as it is prudent to avoid &s;ophi&s;try in the latter.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, however obvious it may ap|pear to others, &s;eems to have totally e&s;caped the attention of the body of men who lately &s;at at Philadelphia under the name of "The General American Congre&s;s." In a paper publi&s;hed un|der the title of "A DECLARATION by the Re|pre&s;entatives of the United Colonies of North America"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Appendix.</NOTE>, the facts are either wilfully or igno|rantly mi&s;repre&s;ented; and the arguments deduced from premi&s;es that have no foundation in truth. But, as whatever falls from men who call them|&s;elves the Repre&s;entatives of a People, mu&s;t fall with &s;ome degree of weight on the minds of the undi&s;cerning part of mankind; it becomes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary to examine briefly the rea&s;ons held forth by the Congre&s;s to ju&s;tify the rebellion of their Con&s;tituents. On a &s;ubject &s;o trite, ar|guments advanced by other Writers may &s;ometimes recur; but novelty is le&s;s the object of this part of the di&s;qui&s;ition, than per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Declaration of the Congre&s;s begins with an involved period, which either contains no meaning, or a meaning not founded on the prin|ciples
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of rea&s;on. They &s;eem to in&s;inuate, that no body of men, in any Empire, can exerci&s;e <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an unbounded authority over others;"</Q> an opinion contrary to fact under every form of Government. No maxim in policy is more univer&s;ally admitted, than that a &s;upreme and uncontroulable power mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;omewhere in every State. This ultimate power, though ju&s;tly dreaded and reprobated in the per&s;on of ONE MAN, is the fir&s;t &s;pring in every Political Society. The great difference, between the degrees of freedom in various Governments, con&s;i&s;ts merely in the manner of placing this ne|ce&s;&s;ary di&s;cretionary power. In the Briti&s;h Em|pire it is ve&s;ted, where it is mo&s;t &s;afe, in King, Lords, and Commons, under the collective ap|pellation of the Legi&s;lature. The Legi&s;lature is another name for the Con&s;titution of the State; and, in fact, the State it&s;elf. The Americans &s;till own them&s;elves the &s;ubjects of the State; but if they refu&s;e obedience to the laws of the Legi&s;|lature, they play upon words, and are no longer Subjects, but Rebels. In vain have they affirmed that they are the Subjects of the King's preroga|tive, and not his Subjects in his legi&s;lative qua|lity; as the King, with regard to his Subjects in general, is to be con&s;idered only in his executive capacity as the great hereditary Magi&s;trate, who carries into effect the laws of the Legi&s;lature, the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
only di&s;cretionary and uncontroulable power in a free State.</P>
<P>The di&s;cretionary and uncontroulable authority of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature being granted, their right to tax all the Subjects of the Briti&s;h Empire can never be denied. Some ill-informed rea&s;oners in politics have lately &s;tarted an ob&s;olete maxim, which has been &s;eized with avidity by the Ame|ricans, That <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Supreme Power cannot take from any one any part of his property without his con&s;ent;"</Q> or in other words, That Repre&s;en|tation is in&s;eparable from Taxation. The Colo|ni&s;ts, &s;ay they, have no Repre&s;entatives in Parlia|ment, and therefore Parliament has no right to tax the Coloni&s;ts. Upon this principle, &s;carce one in twenty-five of the people of Great-Britain is re|pre&s;ented. Out of more than &s;even millions, fewer than three hundred thou&s;and have an exclu&s;ive right to chu&s;e Members of Parliament; and, there|fore, more than three times the number of the Americans have an equal right with them to di&s;|pute the authority of the Legi&s;lature to &s;ubject them to taxes. The truth is, Repre&s;entation never accompanied Taxation in any State. The Romans were a free nation; yet the Senate, that is, the great body of the Nobility, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ole right of taxing the people. In this kingdom, the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Hou&s;e of Commons have an exclu&s;ive right of modifying and regulating the quantity of public &s;upplies, and the manner of laying taxes: but the Commons, by their own authority, cannot en|force the rai&s;ing the &s;upplies they vote. That pri|vilege is inherent in the &s;upreme and unac|countable power ve&s;ted in the three branches of the Legi&s;lature united; who are in fact the State, as the virtual Repre&s;entatives of the whole Em|pire, and not the delegates of individuals.</P>
<P>Why it has been &s;o generally received as a maxim, in this country, That Taxation and Re|pre&s;entation are in&s;eparable, requires to be ex|plained. Men, little acquainted with the Con&s;ti|tution, derived the opinion from their finding, that it is the indi&s;putable right of the Com|mons, that all grants of &s;ub&s;idies and parlia|mentary aids &s;hould originate in their Hou&s;e. But though they fir&s;t be&s;tow tho&s;e &s;ub&s;idies and aids, their grants, as has been already ob&s;erved, have no effect without the a&s;&s;ent of the other two branches of the Legi&s;lature. The common rea&s;on given for this exclu&s;ive privilege is, That as the &s;upplies are rai&s;ed upon the body of the people, the people only ought to have the right of taxing them&s;elves. This argument would have been con|clu&s;ive, if the Commons taxed none but tho&s;e by
<PB N="6" REF="7">
who&s;e &s;uffrages they obtained their &s;eats in Parlia|ment. But it has appeared, that more than &s;even millions of people, be&s;ides the Peers, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a &s;hare of property in the kingdom, have no voice in the election of the Mem|bers who &s;it in the Lower Hou&s;e. The Commons, therefore, and their Con&s;tituents not being the <HI>only</HI> per&s;ons taxed, the former cannot po&s;&s;ibly have the <HI>only</HI> right of rai&s;ing and modelling the &s;upply, from the mere circum&s;tance of Repre&s;entation. But if they have it not from Repre&s;entation, they mu&s;t in fact derive it from the &s;upreme and di&s;cretion|ary power, which is repo&s;ed in them, in con|junction with the two other branches of the Legi|&s;lature. It appears, upon the whole, that Taxa|tion is the re&s;ult of that di&s;cretionary authority placed in the hands of the Legi&s;lature, and ex|erted by them for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of the State. To this authority the whole Empire mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and con&s;equently no one of its &s;ubjects can claim any exemption.</P>
<P>The Counties Palatine of Che&s;ter, Durham, and Lanca&s;ter, were anciently in the &s;ame predicament with the Americans, on the article of Taxa|tion. The Earl of Che&s;ter and the Bi&s;hop of Durham became, by pre&s;cription and im|memorial
<PB N="7" REF="8">
cu&s;tom, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a kind of regal juri&s;diction, within their re&s;pective territo|ries. A &s;imilar form of Government was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by King Edward III. in the County of Lanca&s;ter; which was erected fir&s;t into an Earldom, and then into a Dukedom, in the per&s;on of Henry Plantagenet; who&s;e heire&s;s carried the &s;ame rights and privileges to John of Gant, that King's fourth &s;on, and his po&s;terity. But though the SUBORDI|NATE SOVEREIGNS of the&s;e Counties could pardon trea&s;ons, murders and felonies; though they appointed all Judges, nominated all Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and, in &s;hort, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exclu&s;ively the whole internal Government of their &s;everal Counties; their SUB|JECTS (if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed) were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"al|ways bound by the Acts and Statutes"</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statutes at Large, 34 and 35 of Henry VIII. c. 13.</NOTE> of an A&s;&s;embly, in which they had no Repre&s;entatives. They were al&s;o <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"liable to all payments, rates, and &s;ub&s;idies, granted by the Parliament of Eng|land"</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 25 of Charles II. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Counties (it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed), like the Americans, con&s;idered their being excluded from having Repre&s;entatives in an A&s;&s;embly by which
<PB N="8" REF="9">
they were taxed, a grievance. Accordingly, the Town and County of Che&s;ter, as far back as the thirty-fifth of Henry VIII. petitioned the Legi&s;la|ture for the privilege of &s;ending Members to Par|liament; and their reque&s;t was granted by an ex|pre&s;s Statute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 of Henry VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. The County and City of Durham made a &s;imilar application, and with the &s;ame &s;uc|ce&s;s, in the twenty-fifth of Charles II<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">25 of Charles II. c. 9,</NOTE>. Had the Americans, in&s;tead of flying to arms, &s;ubmitted the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ed grievance, in a peaceable and dutiful manner, to the Legi&s;lature, I can perceive no rea&s;on why their reque&s;t &s;hould be refu&s;ed. Had they, like the County and City of Che&s;ter, repre&s;ented, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for lack of Knights and Bur|ge&s;&s;es to repre&s;ent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made with|in the &s;aid Court, derogatory to their mo&s;t an|cient juri&s;dictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietne&s;s, re&s;t and peace;"</Q> this Country would, I am per&s;uaded, have no ob|jection to their being repre&s;ented in her Parlia|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
But the Colonies, though that circum&s;tance is only in&s;inuated in the Declaration, have uniformly affirmed, that granting the &s;upremacy of Parlia|ment &s;hould extend over the whole Empire, yet that they them&s;elves have a right to an exemption from Taxes either by the conce&s;&s;ions of the Legi|&s;lature, or by charters from the King. It &s;eems incompatible with rea&s;on, &s;ay they, that the Co|lonies &s;hould have internal Legi&s;latures of their own, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the authority of taxation, and that, notwith&s;tanding, the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hould re|tain its power of laying impo&s;ts. The fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions is not founded in truth. The Charters give no exemption from Taxation; on the contrary, &s;ome of them expre&s;sly &s;ubject the Co|lonies to the &s;upreme Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain; and had the Charters mentioned an exemption, the Legi&s;lature, by virtue of its &s;upreme, univer&s;al, and di&s;cretionary power, can recal any rights they have conferred, when the good of the State renders that mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. Though the King may give away by Charter a right that militates again&s;t him&s;elf, as hereditary Chief Magi&s;trate, he cannot authorize, by any deed whatever, an exemption from the general laws of the State. In &s;uch a ca&s;e ONE of the THREE branches of the Legi&s;lature would u&s;urp the power of the THREE UNITED; a &s;oleci&s;m as great in polity, as it is in mathe|maticks
<PB N="10" REF="11">
to a&s;&s;irm, that a part is greater than the whole.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to make an apo|logy for entering &s;o minutely into the argument in favour of the right of Taxation. The Americans them&s;elves have de&s;erted that ground. They &s;peak no longer as &s;ubjects. They a&s;&s;ume the language of rivals, and they act as enemies. The que&s;tion between them and Great-Britain (for it is no longer between them and Government) con&s;i&s;ts of dependence or independence, connection or no connection, except on the footing of a Sovereign State. They have already arrogated to them&s;elves all the functions of Sovereignty. They have formed a great deliberative Council. They have taken the whole executive power into their own hands. They have &s;truck a new currency, rai&s;ed armies, appointed generals; and that they have not cho&s;en ANOTHER SOVEREIGN, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed more to their Republican principles, than to any remains of loyalty for their lawful Prince.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs and opinions, it is matter of little &s;urprize, that men who deny the autho|rity of the State &s;hould load the Legi&s;lature with opprobrious epithets. The Congre&s;s accordingly &s;tigmatize Parliament with various charges of
<PB N="11" REF="12">
tyranny, violence, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Pa&s;&s;ing from this &s;train of general &s;currility, they enter into warm encomiums on the ance&s;tors of their Con&s;ti|tuents. But they now deviate as much from truth in their applau&s;e, as they had done before in their cen&s;ure. They affirm, that the ance&s;tors of the Coloni&s;ts obtained the lands which they have tran&s;|mitted to the pre&s;ent race, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"without any charge to the country from which they removed."</Q> Their very enemies could not wi&s;h to meet them on more advantageous ground. The &s;ums ex|pended upon the various Provinces, &s;ince their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, for their ordinary &s;upport, go|vernment, and protection, have been &s;o enor|mous, that without the authority of incon|te&s;tible vouchers, they could &s;carcely obtain credit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

<P>The Congre&s;s, in the next paragraph of their Declaration, affect to reprobate the la&s;t Peace, though they have derived &s;o many and &s;o great advantages from that treaty. The conduct of the Americans ought al&s;o to induce this Kingdom to regret the &s;tipulations &s;he made for their &s;ecu|rity. Had Canada remained in the hands of the French, the Colonies would have remained duti|ful &s;ubjects. Their fears for them&s;elves, in that ca&s;e, would have &s;upplied the place of their pre|tended affection for this Nation.

would have always recurred to their minds, as long as the objects of their former terror &s;hould continue &s;o near their borders. But their habi|tual fears from France were, it &s;eems, removed only to give room to their ingratitude to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The effrontery with which the Congre&s;s reprobate the late Peace, is &s;carcely equal to their folly in applauding the Mini&s;ter who had car|ried on the war. With peculiar incon&s;i&s;tency they affect to commence an aera of <Q REND="inline">"Public Ruin,"</Q> from Mr. Pitt's re&s;ignation in 1761; yet the whole <Q REND="inline">"object of their wi&s;hes"</Q> is to be placed on the &s;ame footing as in the year 1763. They do not recollect, or rather they pretend to forget, that the mo&s;t &s;plendid actions in the war, happened after Mr. Pitt retired from his office. They are ignorant, or de&s;ignedly conceal, that the com|merce of this kingdom has amazingly encrea&s;ed, and, in con&s;equence, its revenue, &s;ince the aera from which they date public ruin. They know, or they ought, from their own experience, to know, that notwith&s;tanding their &s;hutting their ports again&s;t our manufactures, permanent and profitable &s;ources of commerce have been opened in other quarters; that in&s;tead of being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their pre&s;ent interruption to trade, our Mer|chants

<P>Having repre&s;ented the pretended ruin brought upon the Briti&s;h Empire by the late Peace, the Congre&s;s de&s;cend to the fictitious grievances of America &s;ince the &s;ame period.

The Coloni&s;ts having obtained &s;uch amazing ad|vantages by a Peace, which they now reprobate, it was deemed ju&s;t and proper by Mr. Grenville, then at the head of the Trea&s;ury, that they &s;hould bear a proportionable &s;hare of the national burdens incurred by the war. But as their prior

inability to bear internal Taxes had precluded him from having a precedent, he only <HI>threw out,</HI> as it is vulgarly expre&s;&s;ed, in the beginning of the year 1764, his intentions of rai&s;ing a revenue in America by a Stamp-Duty, &s;imilar to that e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great-Britain; referring the con&s;ideration of the whole af|fair to the next Se&s;&s;ion. His object was, to give time to the Colonies to propo&s;e &s;ome other mode of Taxation, &s;hould that &s;ugge&s;ted to Parliament ap|pear either improper or burden&s;ome. During the whole of the &s;ummer 1764, though &s;ome di&s;con|tented &s;pirits murmured, not a &s;ingle doubt was &s;tarted again&s;t the ABSOLUTE RIGHT of Parliament to impo&s;e Taxes on every Member of the Briti&s;h Empire. The time allowed to the Colonies fur|ni&s;hed them with no expedient for rai&s;ing a tax more &s;uitable to the purpo&s;e of a Revenue (which, by the bye, was to have been &s;pent among them|&s;elves); and, therefore, in the beginning of the year 1765, the famous Stamp-Act was pa&s;&s;ed, again&s;t a very incon&s;iderable Minority, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>In this Kingdom, as well as in every State po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, there are always to be found factious per&s;ons, who oppo&s;e every mea&s;ure of Go|vernment. In their eagerne&s;s to di&s;grace the Mi|ni&s;ter, they too frequently ob&s;truct the &s;ervice,

and defeat the intere&s;ts of their Country. Every &s;ide of a &s;peculative point is armed with argu|ments, that may impo&s;e on the ignorant, and en|courage the &s;anguine. The Oppo&s;ition in Parlia|ment, in &s;hort, committed them&s;elves too far in favour of the prejudices of the Americans, with regard to the Stamp-Act, to &s;upport it with vi|gour, when they them&s;elves, very unexpectedly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Rockingham and others in Oppo&s;ition came into office July 10, 1765, Grenville and his party having thrown them&s;elves out of place on the Regency Bill.</NOTE>, came into Office, a few months after it had pa&s;&s;ed into Law. Though their view of the object chan|ged with their elevation, they found that the flame which their own factious &s;peeches, in the preceding Se&s;&s;ion, had rai&s;ed in America, was too vehement to be extingui&s;hed without conce&s;|&s;ions. A natural timidity of di&s;po&s;ition, joined to the common want of firmne&s;s which accompa|nies novelty in Office, rendered them inclinable to purcha&s;e pre&s;ent quiet for them&s;elves, at the ex|pence of the future advantage of their Country. But &s;till they wavered on the point of irre&s;olution, till Mr. Pitt's oratory weighed down the &s;cale. The Stamp-Act was repealed; and from that mo|ment may be dated <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the commencement of"</Q> what the Americans call <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an Aera of Public Ruin."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
To enter into the motives of Mr. Pitt's oratory, for the total and ab&s;olute repeal of the Stamp-Act, would be to de&s;ert a great and public &s;ubject for the &s;ake of tracing the private views of an ambi|tious man. In his Argument, if what he advanced de&s;erves the name, he fell in with the vulgar and, it may be &s;aid, fal&s;e maxim, That no profit ought to be expected from the Colonies, but That re&s;ult|ing from their Commerce. This opinion of Mr. Pitt, whether it proceeded from ignorance or de|&s;ign (and it probably proceeded from both), has formed a popular error in former times, as well as in the pre&s;ent age. Many, who have pretended to under&s;tand perfectly the affairs of this kingdom, mo&s;t firmly, but in my opinion very weakly, be|lieved that the great &s;ecret of our political intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in forcing, in a manner, a monopoly of foreign commerce. It was from this per&s;ua&s;ion, that the popular Orator u&s;ed, upon the occa&s;ion ju&s;t mentioned, a figure of rhetoric at once fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, when he affirmed, that the Coloni&s;ts &s;hould be prohibited <Q REND="inline">"from manufacturing even the hob|nail of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe!"</Q> One might be tempted to a&s;k the Orator, how this prohibitory mandate could be enforced; or if it could, whether it is le&s;s arbi|trary, than to demand an <HI>internal</HI> tax from the Americans, for the &s;upport of their own govern|ment, and even for the general &s;upport of the State,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and as a &s;uitable return for the protection which they have ever derived from the Government of this kingdom?</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s had &s;urely forgot this &s;trange rhetorical figure of the great Orator, when they were tempted to date PUBLIC RUIN, from his re|&s;ignation in 1761. They have al&s;o forgot, or they do not chu&s;e to remember, that he ac|quie&s;ced in the DECLARATORY BILL, brought in and pa&s;&s;ed by the Marquis of Rocking|ham's Party, who were in office, in the begin|ning of the year 1766. This Bill expre&s;ly declares, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that all his Maje&s;ty's Colonies and Plantations in America have been, are and of right ought to be, &s;ubordinate to and dependent upon the Im|perial Crown and PARLIAMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN; who have full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient validity to bind the Colonies and People of America, &s;ub|jects of the Crown of Great Britain, IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pitt, to pre&s;erve &s;ome degree of con&s;i&s;tency, objected to the words <Q REND="inline">"IN ALL CASES WHATSO|EVER."</Q> But his oppo&s;ition was &s;o languid, that he did not attend the Hou&s;e when the Bill was pa&s;&s;ed; and only five Peers were found to follow

<P><Q REND="inline">"The Declaratory Act,"</Q> as the American Congre&s;s affirms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"comprehends all the grievances of which they complain."</Q> Yet that very Congre&s;s, with pe|culiar effrontery, not only approve, but even prai&s;e the conduct of the very Party by whom the Bill was introduced, and the MAN, by who&s;e CRIMINAL ACQUIESCENCE (to u&s;e one of his own phra&s;es) it pa&s;&s;ed into a law. THAT Party and THAT MAN, being now in oppo&s;ition to Govern|ment, the Americans endeavour to &s;ecure their &s;upport, by flattering their vanity at the ex|pence of truth! They forget pa&s;t demerits in the hopes of pre&s;ent &s;ervices. But when they expect to deceive a whole Party into their intere&s;t, they them&s;elves are made the tools of that Party; and, like the figure of the Negro, near Temple-bar, are turned round by the machine, which they pre|tend to move.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s, in a &s;train of eloquent adulation, &s;peaks with raptures of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that illu&s;trious Band of di&s;tingui&s;hed Peers and Commoners,"</Q> who now declaim, argue, and prote&s;t, in favour of their own Rebellion.

very <Q REND="inline">"illu&s;trious Band,"</Q> encouraged by the ne|gative oppo&s;ition made by the Earl of Chatham, who&s;e advice the Band followed, as it &s;oon after appeared, to their own political de&s;truc|tion. Be&s;ides, was it not under the Admini&s;tra|tion of the Earl of Chatham, in the years 1767 and 1768, though the Americans date their mi&s;|fortunes from the re&s;ignation of Mr. Pitt in Octo|ber 1761, that the Bills impo&s;ing internal duties, and con&s;equently e&s;tabli&s;hing internal Taxation in America, were pa&s;&s;ed into laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7 Geo.

<P>In reprobating the Declaratory Act, the Con|gre&s;s recur to their u&s;ual maxim, That Taxation

and Repre&s;entation are in&s;eparable. Though it has been already &s;hewn, that they are as much repre|&s;ented as twenty-four in twenty-five of the inhabi|tants of Great-Britain; though it has been prov|ed, that whole Provinces, not repre&s;ented, had been for &s;everal ages &s;ubjected to impo&s;ts laid by the Legi&s;lature; though it &s;hall, hereafter, appear that they them&s;elves have been uniformly taxed by the Briti&s;h Parliament; this argument they hold forth as invincible, and found upon it their pre&s;ent re|&s;i&s;tance to the &s;upremacy of the Parent-kingdom. In pur&s;uing it injudiciou&s;ly and too far, they actually di&s;cover the expediency, and even nece&s;|&s;ity of that &s;upremacy, of which they &s;o loudly complain. The Parliament of Great-Britain, &s;ay they, will certainly perceive, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, will actually lighten their own burdens, in proportion as they increa&s;e ours."</Q> But is it not equitable, is it not ju&s;t, is it not nece&s;&s;ary, that all the &s;ubjects of the empire &s;hould bear, as equally as po&s;&s;ible, the public burdens of the empire? Why &s;hould the Americans, who have &s;o largely, &s;o uniformly, and &s;o effectually experienced the protection of Government, be the only per&s;ons exempted from paying their &s;hare of its expences? Is it either rea&s;onable or &s;uitable to the common u&s;age of Na|tions,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
that tho&s;e who de&s;ert their country &s;hould enjoy greater privileges than tho&s;e that remain? The Americans having been &s;pared during the in|fancy of their Colonies on account of their poverty, endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h into an inherent right what was actually an indulgence.</P>
<P>Though this indulgence has been a &s;ource of error to the more ignorant part of the Americans, there are &s;urely many among them, who know, that Parliament hath been uniformly accu&s;tomed to extend its &s;upremacy over all the Colonies. In matters of revenue, in commerce, in civil, in all judicial regulations; and, in &s;hort, with regard to the general con&s;titution of their government, the Provinces of North-America, till taught other|wi&s;e by a di&s;appointed Faction in this Kingdom, allowed, that the whole fabrick of their polity might be new-modelled and reformed by the &s;u|perintending power of Parliament. In fact, it has been &s;o new-modelled and reformed, whenever abu&s;es in the Admini&s;tration of their Government, under their civil polity, or the general intere&s;t of the Briti&s;h Empire, made it nece&s;&s;ary for Parliament to interpo&s;e its authority. In&s;tances of this inter|po&s;ition, in both ca&s;es, pre&s;ent them&s;elves, in al|mo&s;t every volume of the Statutes, from the Re&s;to|ration down to the pre&s;ent reign; yet the Ameri|cans fal&s;ely in&s;inuate, that it was in the pre&s;ent
<PB N="26" REF="27">
reign the exerci&s;e of the authority of Parliament (except only in the regulation of trade) fir&s;t com|menced.</P>
<P>A brief recital of &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;tances may throw light on a &s;ubject, rendered ob&s;cure and perplexed by the prejudices of the ignorant, and the arts of de&s;igning men. To gain the ears of the Populace, by awakening their ancient jea|lou&s;ies, the Americans affect to a&s;cribe the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures to principles of Toryi&s;m, which, they pretend, prevail in our Councils. But, unfortunately for this part of their plan of decep|tion, it will appear, that mo&s;t of the Acts which bind America in coercive regulations, were pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after the Revolution; in the reign of the very Prince, who brought about that great event. The WHIG Mini&s;ters of King William (perceiving that the Colonies, even then, had entertained views of placing them&s;elves on a ground of inde|pendence on Parliament) advi&s;ed their Sovereign, and their advice now &s;tands on record, to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures, which, in their con&s;equence, &s;hould effectually &s;ecure their thorough dependence on the Legi&s;lature of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the advice given by a WHIG Mini&s;try to a King who had mounted the throne
<PB N="27" REF="28">
upon WHIG principles; and al&s;o upon the ful|le&s;t evidence of the frauds and abu&s;es committed in the Plantations, in violation of the Act of Navi|gation; the Act of the 7th and 8th of William III. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for preventing frauds, and regulating abu&s;es, in the Plantations"</Q> was pa&s;&s;ed. By that Act, a power was given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea|&s;ury and Cu&s;toms in England, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to e&s;tabli&s;h ports, and appoint Officers, in the Plantations; and tho&s;e Officers to have the &s;ame authority for vi&s;iting &s;hips and goods, and entering hou&s;es and warehou&s;es, as was exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame Officers in England."</Q></P>
<P>All penalties and forfeitures were made recover|able in the Courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in Courts of Admiralty, in the Plantations; which Courts were then, for the <HI>fir&s;t time,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout all America. In any action or &s;uit concerning his Maje&s;ty's Duties, the offence might be laid in any precinct or divi&s;ion of the Plantations, where the &s;ame &s;hould be alledged to have been com|mitted, at the di&s;cretion of the Officer or Informer. All laws, by-laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms repugnant to any laws of Great Britain which relate to the Plantations, or mention the &s;ame, are declared <Q REND="inline">"illegal, null, and void."</Q> Many other re&s;trictions,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
too tedious to be mentioned, were at the &s;ame time enacted and impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it was not in matters of Trade ONLY, that Parliament, during the reign of King William, &s;uperintended and controuled the Colonies. The Coloni&s;ts, it was found, had encouraged Pirates, in various places; and no ju&s;tice could be obtained in THEIR Courts again&s;t offenders, whom they openly abetted. To remedy this &s;hameful abu&s;e, a remarkable Act was pa&s;&s;ed, in the 11th and 12th of William III. This Act aboli&s;hed all juri&s;diction in that ca&s;e, in the Courts in the Plantations. The SOLE power of trying &s;uch offences, in the Colonies, was ve&s;ted in Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed under the Great Seal of England, or Seal of the Admiralty, according to the cour&s;e of the Admiralty, that is to &s;ay, WITHOUT JURY. The Commi&s;&s;ioners were al&s;o impowered to i&s;&s;ue warrants, in any of the Colonies, for arre&s;ting &s;uch Pirates or their ac|ce&s;&s;aries. They might, at di&s;cretion, either try the criminals in America, or &s;end them to Eng|land to be tried. Should the Governors of any Charter or Proprietary Government refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners; &s;hould any per&s;on in authority, in the Colonies, refu&s;e to pay obedience to the Act;
<PB N="29" REF="30">
&s;uch refu&s;al, in either ca&s;e, was declared to be a forfeiture of the Charter.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 10th and 11th year of the &s;ame reign, confines the advantage of the Fi&s;hery of Newfoundland to Briti&s;h &s;hips fitted out from Great-Britain. The execution of the orders and regulations re&s;pecting that Fi&s;hery, was placed in the hands of the Admirals, in the re&s;pective harbours; that is to &s;ay, in the hands of the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip that &s;hould fir&s;t arrive from Great-Britain. The deci&s;ion in all que&s;tions of civil &s;uit is ve&s;ted in &s;uch Admirals, with appeal to the Commander of the King's &s;hips. All criminal offences are to be tried, in any County of England, by the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Oyer and Terminer and Goal deli|very.</P>
<P>The opinions of this Nation concerning the Government of the Colonies, may be collected from the above Acts. The authority of Parliament to bind America, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and when|ever the general intere&s;t of the whole Empire re|quired it, was never di&s;puted; and it was often exerted to correct abu&s;es, and to &s;uppre&s;s the ideas of independence, which began, even then, to be
<PB N="30" REF="31">
cheri&s;hed by the Colonies. The &s;ame principles, and the &s;ame policy, were carried down by Parlia|ment through the three &s;ucceeding reigns of Queen Anne, and of George I. and George II.</P>
<P>Early in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e reigns, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;es were committed by the petty Legi&s;latures in the Colonies, with re&s;pect to Coin. The interpo&s;ition of Parliament became nece&s;&s;ary to correct tho&s;e abu&s;es. An Act was pa&s;&s;ed in the 6th of Queen Anne, for that purpo&s;e; when the Coun|cils of that Prince&s;s were guided by Whigs. By this Act the rates of Foreign Coin, in the Planta|tions, were a&s;certained; and a &s;evere puni&s;hment was inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hould take them at higher rates. The American Trade was placed in the &s;ame reign under further re&s;trictions, by Act of Parliament. Rice and Mola&s;&s;es were added to the li&s;t of enumerated commodities. In the reign of George I. Furrs and Copper-ore of the Plan|tations were &s;ubjected to the &s;ame re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h Parliament confined not to Acts their &s;en&s;e of the undoubted right they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of controuling the Colonies, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. In the Journals of both Hou&s;es, there are many Proceedings which furni&s;h proofs of their unde|viating
<PB N="31" REF="32">
adherence to the &s;ame principles. In the year 1702, a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, for aboli&s;hing all the Charter and Pro|prietary Governments in America, and reuniting them to the Crown. In 1705, the Hou&s;e of Lords came to &s;everal Re&s;olutions on the &s;ubject of laws enacted in &s;everal of tho&s;e Governments. They declared tho&s;e laws to be repugnant to the laws of England, and de&s;tructive to the Con&s;titu|tion. This proceeding was likewi&s;e followed by a Bill for aboli&s;hing tho&s;e Charters.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bills, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, were not car|ried into laws. But they did not fail, through any doubt entertained by the Legi&s;lature again&s;t their propriety. They were lo&s;t through a change in the &s;ituation of tho&s;e, who brought forward the mea&s;ure. That the opinion of the Legi&s;lature continued the &s;ame on this &s;ubject, is evident; as the &s;ame propo&s;ition was again taken up in the year 1716; when a WHIG Mini&s;try governed the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the reign of George II. the in&s;tances of the controuling authority of Parliament over the Co|lonies, are more numerous and &s;triking. By an Act of the 2d of George II. Chap. 35. &s;evere pro|hibitions

and penalties are impo&s;ed and inflicted on &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall cut and de&s;troy whole Pine|trees. Though &s;uch trees are growing within the limits of a Town&s;hip, the penalties are directed to be &s;ued for and recovered in the Courts of Admi|ralty. The Merchants of Great-Britain having, in the 5th of the &s;ame reign, preferred a Petition to Parliament, complaining of the difficulties they met with in the recovery of debts in the Planta|tions; an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, which &s;ubjected all real E&s;tates in the Colonies to ju&s;t debts and demands; and to be a&s;&s;ets, in the &s;ame manner as in England, for the &s;atisfaction of debts due by Bond. The ex|portation of Hats from any of the Colonies, and even the conveyance of them by land from one Colony to another, is prohibited, under &s;evere penalties, by an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the year 1733 the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay pre&s;ented a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, praying that they might be heard by Coun|&s;el on the &s;ubject of Grievances.

<P>The&s;e &s;pirited Re&s;olutions of the Commons checked, for &s;ome time, the abu&s;es in the emi&s;&s;ion

and circulation of Paper-Money. The New-England Government, however, did not continue long to pay any regard to ROYAL In&s;tructions, though &s;upported and enforced by the authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The frauds committed awakened again the attention of Parliament. In the 24th of George II. an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to regulate and re&s;train Paper-bills of Credit in the Four New-England Governments."</Q> The Go|vernors of tho&s;e Colonies were prohibited, under pain of being removed from their Governments, and for ever rendered incapable of any public office or place of tru&s;t, from a&s;&s;enting to any Act, Order, or Vote, for the i&s;&s;ue of any Paper-bills of Credit; and all &s;uch Acts, Orders, or Votes, were declared to be, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> null and void.</P>
<P>In the year 1741 the Colonies took up the idea of a LAND-BANK, which had proved &s;o un&s;ucce&s;s|ful in England in the reign of King William. The <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"American A&s;&s;emblies,"</Q> it appeared to Parliament, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had PRESUMED to publi&s;h a &s;cheme for &s;upplying a pretended want of a medium in trade, for &s;etting up a Bank on land &s;ecurity, and to &s;olicit &s;ub&s;criptions."</Q> To correct this evil, an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, in the 14th of George II.
<PB N="36" REF="37"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to re&s;train and prevent &s;uch unwarrantable prac|tices; and to extend to America, the penalties inflicted by a Statute of the 6th of George I. on per&s;ons guilty of &s;uch practices in the&s;e king|doms."</Q> They were al&s;o &s;ubjected, by the &s;ame Act, to the penalty and forfeiture ordained by the Statute of provi&s;ion and PREMUNIRE of the 16th of Richard the Second.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other Statutes by which Par|liament with equal force a&s;&s;ert their authority over the Colonies. In &s;ome of the&s;e they carry this authority beyond the limits, with which they have hitherto circum&s;cribed it in this Kingdom. In the 29th of George II. cap. 35. Officers of the Army are empowered to enli&s;t, in the Colonies, ap|prentices and indented &s;ervants. The per&s;ons &s;o enli&s;ted were exempted from arre&s;ts in civil actions, where the value of the action exceeds not ten pounds. To the&s;e &s;triking in&s;tances of the con|trouling power of Parliament over the Colonies, may be added the Act of 23d of George II. cap. 29. By that Act, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every per&s;on erecting or working any mill or other engine for &s;litting or rolling iron, or any plating forge or furnace for making &s;teel, is &s;ubjected to a penalty of 200l. to be recovered in any of the Courts in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
or in the Court of Exchequer in Scot|land."</Q></P>
<P>The foregoing recital of Statutes binding the Colonies, prior to the pre&s;ent reign, of which the Congre&s;s &s;o much complain, is &s;ufficient to con|vince the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, that the controuling power of Parliament has been perpetually exerted, and never di&s;puted. There is hardly any object of Legi&s;lation in which the laws of this Country have not bound America. Taxation has been purpo&s;ely omitted in the above detail. That article, as the great object of conte&s;t, ought to be &s;eparately &s;tated. I &s;hall, therefore, throw into one point of view, all the in&s;tances of the exerci&s;e of the power of the Briti&s;h Parliament in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of Taxation is the Act of the 12th of Charles II. for granting to the Crown a duty of Tonnage and Poundage. This Act is in point. It directs, that the duties abovementioned <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hall be payable upon commodities not only imported into the realm of England, but al&s;o into the DOMINIONS THEREUNTO BELONGING."</Q> The Colonies are here included in expre&s;s words. It is true, indeed, that the Duties of Tonnage
<PB N="38" REF="39">
and Poundage were NOT collected in America. The rea&s;on was, that the commerce of the Plantations was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the revenue ari&s;ing from it could not pay the expence of collection.</P>
<P>But whatever might have been the rea&s;on for NOT collecting the Duties of Tonnage and Poundage in the Colonies, the Law was certainly under&s;tood to extend to America. In the year 1680, the A&s;&s;em|bly of the I&s;land of Jamaica refu&s;ed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to rai&s;e levies for the &s;upport of Government."</Q> Upon this refu&s;al, the Lords of the Council made a Minute <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to confer with the Judges upon the que&s;tion: Whether the &s;ub&s;idies upon the Tonnage and Poundage upon goods that may by Law, or &s;hall be directly carried to Jamaica, be not payable, according to Law, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects inhabiting that I&s;land, or trading there, by virtue of the Acts of Tonnage and Poundage, or other Acts made in England?"</Q> Unfortunately it does not appear, whether the conference was ever held; or if it was actually held, what was the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The 25th of Charles II. cap. 7. is the next Act that binds America, in point of Taxation. By that Act certain duties are made payable in the Plantations, upon &s;ugar, tobacco, cotton, wool,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
indigo, ginger, logwood, fu&s;tic, and other dying woods, and cocoa-nuts exported to any other place, except England. The&s;e Duties continue to be paid to this day.</P>
<P>In the 9th of Queen Anne, an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, impo&s;ing certain Duties on all prize-goods taken in America, and imported into any of the Colonies. The&s;e Duties were as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All European goods (wine and brandy excepted) which have been u&s;ually &s;ent to the Plantations, are to pay THERE &s;uch Cu&s;toms, as are payable for the like goods imported into the Plantations from Great-Britain. Other goods taken as prizes &s;hall be liable THERE to &s;uch Duties as were payable for the &s;ame, by any Act of A&s;&s;embly, in the &s;aid Plantations."</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e Acts, &s;ubjecting his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects in America to Taxes impo&s;ed by the Briti&s;h Parliament, &s;everal others may be added. The Act of the 9th of Queen Anne, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Po&s;t-office. The various Acts pa&s;&s;ed for levying and inforcing the collection of the duty of &s;ix|pence per month, out of Seamen's wages, for the &s;upport of Greenwich Ho&s;pital. All the&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Acts extend to America. They bind the Colonies, as well as the Mother-Country. Their authority was never di&s;puted; and the Taxes impo&s;ed by them have been uniformly rai&s;ed. The Act of the 2d of George II. cap. 7. is &s;till more explicit and deci&s;ive in the words. It requires the pay|ment of the Duties for Greenwich Ho&s;pital, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by &s;eamen belonging to American &s;hips, whether employed upon the high &s;eas, or in any port, harbour, bay or creek, within ANY of the Co|lonies."</Q></P>
<P>It appears from this detail of facts, that the right of Parliament to bind the Colonies, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, is not a claim founded on mere theory: on the contrary, that the controuling power of the Legi&s;lature is warranted by con&s;tant u&s;age, and uninterrupted practice. That the De|claratory Act, of which the Americans complain, contains no new, no a&s;&s;umed powers over the Plantations; and that there is &s;carce any channel of Legi&s;lation, through which the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment has NOT exerted its &s;upremacy, in as full and ample a manner as it has been exerted over the inhabitants of Great-Britain; and all this prior to the pre&s;ent reign, in which the Congre&s;s place the commencement of <Q REND="inline">"Public Ruin."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
The American Congre&s;s, with a partiality for them&s;elves &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with their de&s;ign of gaining others, in the next paragraph of their De|claration, call the Acts, which were the CONSE|QUENCE of the re&s;i&s;tance of their con&s;tituents, the CAUSE of their rebellion. In de&s;cending to particu|lars, their fir&s;t complaint is &s;tated again&s;t <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ex|ten&s;ion of the juri&s;diction of the Courts of Admi|ralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their former limits;"</Q> by which, they alledge, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;ubject is deprived of his inherent right of a trial by Jury."</Q> The Congre&s;s &s;urely forget, or it is not con&s;i&s;tent with their de&s;ign to remember, that the alterations of which they complain were made at the reque&s;t of their con&s;tituents. The rea|&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this reque&s;t were, that the Courts of Admiralty e&s;tabli&s;hed formerly in the various Provinces, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o little dignity, on account of the dependence and poverty of the judges, that ju&s;tice was either &s;acrificed to connexions, or bi|a&s;&s;ed by avarice. Be&s;ides that, Appeals to Great-Britain could be &s;eldom made, on account of the expence and di&s;tance. To remedy this evil, the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of Courts of Admiralty in America was formed. Four great Courts of Vice-Admiralty were erected. The Judges were ren|dered independent by ample &s;alaries. The line
<PB N="42" REF="43">
of Appeal became &s;hort, ea&s;y, and obvious; and as to trial by Jury, the whole world knows that the Court of Admiralty in England never admitted that mode of trial in CIVIL ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The complaint of the Congre&s;s, with regard to the Bill for &s;hutting the Port of Bo&s;ton, is ri|diculous as well as unju&s;t, as the inhabitants of that place had it in their own power to remove the grievance. The de&s;truction of the Ea&s;t-India Company's tea, at Bo&s;ton, is well known to have been the deliberate act of a very great majority of the inhabitants. To obtain reparation by the common cour&s;e of law was impo&s;&s;ible, where the number of the offenders &s;creened them effectu|ally from ju&s;tice. It was a public crime, and the puni&s;hment ought to have been general. In pur|&s;uance of that plan of tenderne&s;s, which has been fatally lo&s;t on the Americans, the Bill for &s;u&s;|pending the trade of Bo&s;ton was rendered condi|tional. A door was left open for an immediate reconciliation, &s;hould the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;et's-Bay make a public grant, for repairing the damage &s;u&s;tained, by a Company of Merchants, through a public outrage. Yet the Congre&s;s &s;tigmatize with the name of inju&s;tice, a coer|cive &s;tatute rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary by
<PB N="43" REF="44">
the &s;hamele&s;s depredations of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton; and which &s;tatute, they them&s;elves had it in their power to terminate, in an in&s;tant, by doing an act of common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With equal effrontery, and with &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on, the Congre&s;s exclaim again&s;t the alteration made in the form of the government of Bo&s;ton. With their u&s;ual fallacy in argument, the Americans wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h it as a maxim in polity, That Charters granted by the CROWN, can neither be rever&s;ed or altered by the LEGISLATURE. They might as well go at once to the whole &s;upremacy; and &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of thus &s;upporting a cau&s;e untenable on any other grounds. The three branches of the Legi&s;lature united make daily al|terations in the Con&s;titution of Great Britain; and, if their Supremacy extends over the whole empire, they have the &s;ame right to alter the con&s;titution of the American Colonies. If the Americans deny this po&s;ition, all argument is at an end; and they avow an independence, which, in THEIR circum&s;tances, marks them out for enemies. After all, this alteration of which the Congre&s;s affect to complain, is no more than putting the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay on the &s;ame footing with the other Colonies. They have re|ceived in miniature the counter-part of the con|&s;titution
<PB N="44" REF="45">
of the Mother-Kingdom; and have THEY a right, or can THEY wi&s;h to be more free than the free&s;t nation in the world?</P>
<P>The Act for regulating the Government of Quebec, furni&s;hes the Congre&s;s with an ample field for declamation. To inveigh again&s;t Po|pery and Arbitrary Power has been ever a fa|vourite topic with men, who wi&s;h to profit by the prejudices of the people. Had the Congre&s;s attended to the general principles of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, they might have informed them|&s;elves, that His Maje&s;ty, without the inter|po&s;ition of the two other branches of the Legi&s;|lature, might have permitted the inhabitants of Canada to remain for ever under French laws. There is no maxim in the Law of England more generally known or le&s;s controverted than, That in conquered or ceded countries, which have al|ready laws of their own, &s;uch laws remain in full force, till they are altered and changed by the Sovereign. Had His Maje&s;ty, therefore, enter|tained &s;uch de&s;igns, as the Congre&s;s obliquely lay to his charge, why &s;hould he call in the aid of the Legi&s;lature to execute what was already done by the Common Law? The Congre&s;s will not, &s;urely, affirm, that the &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Legi&s;lature in Quebec,
<PB N="45" REF="46">
is &s;o arbitrary in it&s;elf, or &s;o fit for the purpo&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m, as the Con&s;titution which &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed in that Province under the French. Ought they not to con&s;ider, that no other form of government could have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o &s;uitable to the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, the tenures of their property, and the toleration of their religion, to all which they had an undoubt|ed right, by the terms of their Capitulation and the articles of the &s;ub&s;equent Treaty of Peace?</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ition at HOME, as well as the Patriots ABROAD, have found an exten&s;ive &s;ubject for pa|thetic eloquence, in the form of Government now e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in Canada. The FORMER have either very treacherous memories, or they change without any ceremony their opinions with their &s;ituation. Under the admini&s;tration of the EARL of CHATHAM, Mr. Morgan, Lord SHELBURNE'S Secretary, was &s;ent PRIVATELY to America, as Commi&s;&s;ioner, to &s;ettle and regulate a new code for the Government of Quebec. The Governor and Chief Ju&s;tice of that Province, if I am not mi&s;taken, were joined with Morgan in this SECRET, but important commi&s;&s;ion. The mea&s;ure, it is &s;aid, was con&s;idered by the Board of Trade; it was certainly debated, if not adopted by the Cabinet,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
as far back as the year 1767, during the plenitude of the Earl of Chatham's power. Lord Camden was Chancellor, and gave his &s;anction to regulations MORE ALLIED TO DESPOTISM than tho&s;e he repro|bates at pre&s;ent. The Duke of Grafton, the Earl of Shelburne, General Conway, and &s;everal others of <Q REND="inline">"that illu&s;trious Band,"</Q> on who&s;e virtues the Ame|ricans expatiate with rapture, approved this POPISH, ARBITRARY, TYRANNICAL &s;y&s;tem of Government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Rockingham had the <HI>merit</HI> of &s;ending a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hop to Quebec.</NOTE>: yet all the&s;e are, now, true Americans, &s;trenuous Prote&s;tants, Whigs of the ancient mould, determined a&s;&s;ertors of public freedom, avowed enemies to OPPRESSION, POPERY, and ARBITRARY POWER!</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s enumerate, among their com|plaints again&s;t the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, the Re&s;o|lution of Parliament to give its due force to an unrepealed &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in the time of Henry VIII. It is declared in the Re&s;olution, that upon this &s;tatute, trea&s;ons and mi&s;pri&s;ions of trea&s;on com|mitted in any of his Maje&s;ty's dominions beyond &s;ea, &s;ubject to the Crown of Great-Britain, may be tried in England. Though this Re&s;olution is con&s;idered by the Congre&s;s as a part of the ideal
<PB N="47" REF="48">
&s;y&s;tem of en&s;lavement, with which they charge the King and Parliament, it contains no novelty, no uncommon &s;tretch of law. A thou&s;and in|&s;tances of the &s;ame kind are upon record, long before the pre&s;ent di&s;putes with America began. One in&s;tance is extremely remarkable; I mean, the tran&s;actions in the Ca&s;e of the In&s;urrection in Antigua, in the year 1711. All the proceedings were founded on the Act of Henry VIII. Some of the In&s;urgents were &s;ent to England; they were tried upon that Statute; and that circum&s;tance has e&s;|tabli&s;hed a precedent which cannot be controverted. But had even a new law of this kind been made, what rea&s;on could the American Congre&s;s have to complain? Have not the prejudices, in&s;ur|rections, and even rebellion of their own country|men totally interrupted the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice over all the va&s;t Continent which they in|habit; and &s;hall the generality of the crime be ad|mitted a competent excu&s;e again&s;t puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>From condemning the Acts of the Legi&s;lature, the Congre&s;s pa&s;s to complaints again&s;t their So|vereign, as well as his principal &s;ervants. They alledge, that the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Americans have ince&s;&s;antly and ineffectually be&s;ieged the Throne for ten years;"</Q> yet conceal the rea&s;on, which was,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
That their demands, rather than reque&s;ts, were &s;uch as the Sovereign could not grant, con&s;i&s;tent with the powers ve&s;ted in him by the Con&s;titution. They complain, that fleets and armies have been &s;ent to their country, to enforce the coercive laws enacted by the Legi&s;lature, for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of its &s;upremacy; yet they pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the outrages committed by them&s;elves, which rendered that mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. Did they not draw the &s;word with one hand, when the other was &s;tretched forth with petitions for relief from pretended grievances? Did they not purcha&s;e arms, ammunition, and artillery, form maga|zines, enli&s;t &s;oldiers, and prepare, in every re|&s;pect, for rebellion and war, when they affected to &s;peake the language of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and peace?</P>
<P>All the&s;e are facts that cannot be controverted. The Congre&s;s know the truth, but pur&s;ue their plan of deception. <Q REND="inline">"They hoped in vain,"</Q> they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"for moderation in their enemies";</Q> yet their own conduct has been one continued &s;eries of violence, oppre&s;&s;ion, and inju&s;tice. Having di&s;|claimed their allegiance to the Sovereign, di&s;|obeyed the acts of the Legi&s;lature, de&s;troyed the property, and in&s;ulted the per&s;ons of the &s;ervants of the State, a&s;&s;umed the functions of &s;overeignty, and ru&s;hed into actual rebellion; they complain
<PB N="49" REF="50">
of a want of moderation in Government, for ex|erting the power ve&s;ted in it by the Con&s;titution, for re&s;toring tranquillity, enforcing legal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws of the State, and for protecting the injured and puni&s;hing the guilty.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of their &s;trange Decla|ration, the American Congre&s;s appear to adapt their rea&s;onings to the weakne&s;s of the prejudiced, and their facts to the credulity of the ignorant. They affirm, that they have uniformly endea|voured to procure an accommodation with the Mother-Country; yet they reprobate the Re&s;olu|tion of the Commons, on the 20th of February, which opened a fair channel for agreement. They call the Re&s;olution <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an in&s;idious manoeuvre, cal|culated to divide the Americans, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a perpetual auction of taxation, where Colony &s;hould bid again&s;t Colony, all of them uninformed what ran&s;om &s;hould redeem their lives; and thus to extort from them, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown &s;ums that &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gratify, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify mini&s;terial rapacity, with the mi&s;erable indulgence left them of rai&s;ing, in their own mode, the pre&s;cribed tribute."</Q> We may learn, from this tedious and involved &s;entence, how much
<PB N="50" REF="51">
the Congre&s;s have profited by the &s;peeches of Pa|trioti&s;m in the Briti&s;h Parliament.

<P>In this Addre&s;s the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, while they held forth the Sword in one hand, evi|dently tendered the Olive-branch with the other. The Americans them&s;elves were made the ar|biters of their own fate. The choice of war or peace was left in their own hands. But as the offer of Parliament to li&s;ten to the real grievances of the Coloni&s;ts was deemed too general to form a foundation for an agreement between them and the Mother-country, the Mini&s;ter, wi&s;hing to con|ciliate
<PB N="52" REF="53">
matters with America, even contrary to the opinion of many Friends to this Country, laid before the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ome EXPLICIT PROPOSITIONS, which might an&s;wer that end. Ac|cordingly, on the twentieth of February, the fol|lowing Propo&s;itions were introduced to a Com|mittee of the whole Hou&s;e, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly, or General Court of his Maje&s;ty's Provinces or Colonies &s;hall propo&s;e to make pro|vi&s;ion according to their re&s;pective conditions, circum&s;tances, and &s;ituations, for contributing their proportion to the common defence; &s;uch proportion to be rai&s;ed under the authorities of the General Court, or General A&s;&s;embly of &s;uch Province or Colony, and di&s;po&s;able by Parlia|ment; and &s;hall engage to make provi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the Civil Government, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in &s;uch Province or Colony; it will be proper, if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hall be approved by his Maje&s;ty in Parliament, and for &s;o long as &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear in re&s;pect of &s;uch Pro|vince, or Colony, to levy any duties, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, or to impo&s;e any further duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except only &s;uch duties as it may be expedient to impo&s;e for the regulation of

Commerce; the nett produce of the duties la&s;t mentioned, to be carried to the account of &s;uch Province, Colony, or Plantation re&s;pectively."</Q></P>
<P>This Re&s;olution, which was carried by a great majority, plainly marked the ground for a nego|tiation, and an equitable agreement with the Co|lonies. It was moderate, comprehen&s;ive, and explicit. It named the per&s;ons from whom the propo&s;als mu&s;t come, and tho&s;e to whom they were to be made. The end and purpo&s;e of the Con|tribution were explained. The appropriation of the expected revenue was &s;pecified, and precluded every &s;u&s;picion of its being mi&s;applied. Though the offer was conditional, it was plainly conclu|&s;ive, as long as the Americans them&s;elves &s;hould adhere to the agreement. They had it in their power to tax them&s;elves, the great point for which they profe&s;&s;ed to contend; and the only right re|&s;erved by the Legi&s;lature was to determine the QUANTUM of the &s;upply; and they alone can de|termine it, as being the &s;upreme power, who are the &s;ole judges of what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the State. The Propo&s;ition, upon the whole, was AT LEAST as favourable to the preten&s;ions of the Americans, as to the claims of the Mother-Country. The former, therefore, mu&s;t have accepted the
<PB N="54" REF="55">
propo&s;al, had what they held forth to the Public formed the real principles of their oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Minority in Parliament, who deemed no|thing &s;o fatal to their own views, as an agreement with the Americans, upon equitable, and con&s;e|quently permanent terms, oppo&s;ed this Propo&s;i|tion as in&s;idious in its nature, and for that pur|po&s;e rendered ob&s;cure and perplexed in its lan|guage. The American Demagogues, who&s;e in|fluence can only exi&s;t in the mid&s;t of anarchy and confu&s;ion, oppo&s;ed it with &s;imilar views. The latter, indeed, have approved &s;o much of the SENTIMENTS, or rather PROFESSIONS of the former, that they have, in their Declaration, echoed back their very words in Parliament. The argument before went only to the claim of the Americans to be permitted, in their A&s;&s;emblies, to &s;ettle the mode of Taxation. They then demanded an ex|clu&s;ive privilege of fixing the amount or quan|tum of the &s;upply; and now they will give no &s;upply at all. But if neither the mode nor the QUANTUM is to be left in the power of Parliament, what power has Parliament left, with regard to the taxing of the Americans? Ought the BRITISH LEGISLATURE to lay HUMBLY the wants of the Public before the PETTY LEGISLATURES of
<PB N="55" REF="56">
America, and reque&s;t <HI>their</HI> aid for the general &s;upport of Government? What would this be, but the total emancipation of the Colonies from that &s;upremacy for which we contend?</P>
<P>The Americans, formerly, declared them&s;elves willing to contribute to the exigences and expences of the State, provided the demand &s;hould come by requi&s;ition from the King, and not by an imme|diate exertion of Parliamentary authority. This offer his Maje&s;ty declined, with that patrioti&s;m which has uniformly marked his OWN mea&s;ures, during his reign. Anxious for the happine&s;s of ALL his &s;ubjects, he cho&s;e to be the Monarch of ONE great and free nation, rather than the Sove|reign of a number of petty States, weakened by their own di&s;union. Had his Maje&s;ty been actuated by tho&s;e motives of ambition, which are not uncom|mon among Princes, he would have eagerly clo&s;ed with the offers of the Americans. In&s;tead of mak|ing him&s;elf dependent, for the maintenance of his dignity, upon the grants of ONE A&s;&s;embly, he might have extricated him&s;elf from even the fear of pe|cuniary difficulties, by a proper management of many A&s;&s;emblies. The Repre&s;entatives of one Pro|vince might be gratified into the views of the Crown, from the revenue of another; Briti&s;h Mem|bers might receive the wages of corruption in
<PB N="56" REF="57">
America; and American Repre&s;entatives be &s;ent for the price of their votes to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>But &s;ucceeding events have demon&s;trated, that the Americans were not &s;incere, in any one of their declarations, in favour of an amicable accommoda|tion. The Propo&s;itions voted, on the 20th of Fe|bruary, came up to their own former demands; yet they evaded them, by treating them as in&s;idious. The truth is, they knew their own demerits to|wards this Country, and they could not believe, that propo&s;als &s;o highly favourable could have been, on her part, &s;incere. One good, however, has re&s;ulted from the Propo&s;itions. The Colonies, by rejecting them, have left no doubt remaining concerning their real intentions. They confine no longer their claims to the exclu&s;ive privilege of taxing them&s;elves. They aim, evidently, at a total independence in all matters what&s;oever; and more particularly with regard to the Act of Navigation. They have long made &s;ecret but mo&s;t dangerous encroachments on this PALLADIUM of our Commerce. They now publickly avow their re&s;olution to pay no regard to any Parliamentary re&s;trictions, whether ancient or recent, on THEIR Commerce. They now openly trade all over Eu|rope; and the obtaining the privilege, which they have, at length, u&s;urped, has been the primary
<PB N="57" REF="58">
cau&s;e of their re&s;i&s;tance to Parliament. The manufacturers and merchants of this Country have been long no &s;trangers to this American po|licy; yet the Congre&s;s have the effrontery to ex|pect, that the mercantile intere&s;t of Great Britain will e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The American Congre&s;s, having in a loo&s;e, cur&s;ory, and &s;uperficial manner, advanced &s;ome pretended arguments to ju&s;tify their rebellion, de&s;cend to the mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts, with the &s;ame de&s;ign. They affirm, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That General Gage, who had occupied Bo&s;ton as a garri&s;on, &s;ent out a large detachment of his army, on the 19th of April, who made an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault on the inhabitants of the Province of Bo&s;ton, at Lexington."</Q> On this allegation of the Con|gre&s;s, it may be remarked, that the rebellious conduct of the Town of Bo&s;ton, where all the au|thority of legal government had been long extin|gui&s;hed by the tyranny of a rabble in&s;tigated by factious leaders, had rendered a force nece&s;&s;ary in that place, to re&s;tore order and tranquillity, to protect the innocent, and to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of the turbulent and guilty. That the military pre|parations made in all parts of the Province, and e&s;pecially at the Town of Concord, with the avowed intention of oppo&s;ing all legal authority,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
induced and even forced General Gage (though fatally too late) to &s;end out a detachment of the troops under his command, to prevent ho&s;tilities, by &s;eizing the means of carrying them on. That &s;ome of the Inhabitants of the Province, in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"war|like array,"</Q> &s;tood in the way of this detach|ment, with arms in their hands; and that when or|dered to remove in a peaceable manner, they made <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault"</Q> on his Maje&s;ty's troops, by firing FIRST upon them, and killing &s;ome, and wounding many.</P>
<P>The audacity of the Congre&s;s, in a&s;&s;erting FALSEHOODS, demands a brief detail of the TRUTH. General Gage, having been informed, that arms, ammunition, cannon, and other implements of war, had been collected in the town of Concord, ordered a detachment of the Army to march with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy to that place. He gave orders to the detachment, to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;trict di&s;cipline, and to re&s;ent no in&s;ults offered them by the country people, except actual ho&s;|tilities. The General's orders were, in truth, too implicitly ob&s;erved. There was not one LOADED MUSQUET in the whole detachment, except tho&s;e in the hands of FIFTY Marines, who formed the van, when they were FIRED upon, by the country people, at Lexington. The affidavits of the
<PB N="59" REF="60">
rebels, on this &s;ubject, are impo&s;itions and perjuries. There is not a man, whether officer or &s;oldier, in the whole detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of 800 men, but is ready, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to atte&s;t the truth of this fact.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, for the honour of the in&s;urgents, that their BARBAROUS CRUELTY to the wounded &s;oldiers, were more problematical than their firing FIRST on the King's troops. The &s;oldiers who fell by the fir&s;t fire of the rebels, were found &s;calped, when the detachment returned from Concord to Lexington Bridge. Two &s;ol|diers who lay wounded on the field, and had been &s;calped by the &s;avage Provincials, were &s;till breath|ing. They appeared, by the traces of blood, to have rolled in the agonies of this horrid &s;pecies of death, &s;everal yards from the place where they had been &s;calped. Near the&s;e unfortunate men, another dreadful object pre&s;ented it&s;elf. A &s;ol|dier who had been &s;lightly wounded, appeared with his eyes torn out of their &s;ockets, by the bar|barous mode of GOOGING, a word and practice pe|culiar to the Americans. Humanity forbids us to dwell longer on this &s;cene of horror. The rebels, to break the force of accu&s;ation, began to recriminate. They laid &s;everal in&s;tances of wanton cruelty to the charge of the troops; yet nothing is
<PB N="60" REF="61">
better a&s;certained, than that not one of the &s;oldiers ever quitted the road, either upon their march or return from Concord.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s &s;tigmatize the expedition to Lex|ington and Concord, with the epithets <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of an un|provoked and wanton a&s;&s;ault."</Q> Was the col|lecting warlike implements at Concord, rai&s;ing men throughout the Province, di&s;ciplining troops in every di&s;trict, forming magazines, purcha&s;ing ammunition, and preparing arms, no provocation? Were not the whole Country a&s;&s;embled before they knew of this expedition? And was not their be|ing &s;o completely provided with the means of re|pelling ho&s;tilities, a &s;ufficient proof, that they had previou&s;ly re&s;olved to commence them? Could TEN THOUSAND men, the number that attacked (though at a PRUDENT di&s;tance) the troops on their retreat, have been collected by accident, or called together by a &s;udden alarm? Are not the Congre&s;s con&s;cious to them&s;elves, and was not Ge|neral Gage &s;ufficiently apprized, that the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay had determined to begin ho&s;|tilities, had the expedition to Concord never hap|pened? The truth is, the march of the troops had only ha&s;tened the execution of the plan of rebellion &s;ettled before in the &s;ecret Councils of the Provin|cial Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">
The a&s;&s;ertions of the Congre&s;s concerning tran&s;actions within the town of Bo&s;ton, are as utterly devoid of truth, as their account of what happened in the country. The ho&s;tile intentions of tho&s;e WITHIN, were as apparent as the rebellion of their brethren WITHOUT was certain. The great law of &s;elf-defence mu&s;t therefore have ju&s;ti|fied General Gage for having deprived the former of arms, which they almo&s;t avowedly intended to rai&s;e again&s;t all legal authority. After the &s;kir|mi&s;h at Lexington and Concord, all &s;upplies from the country were cut off from the town of Bo&s;ton. Many of the inhabitants de&s;ired to remove, with their effects. Their reque&s;t was granted; but it was at the &s;ame time demanded, that they &s;hould deliver up their arms. This was, at fir&s;t, ap|proved by all; but great clamours &s;oon after fol|lowed. Such of the inhabitants as were well af|fected, or pretended to be well affected to Go|vernment, alledged, that none but the ill-inclined &s;hewed any inclination to remove; and that when they &s;hould become &s;afe with their effects, the town would be &s;et on fire. A great demur having al&s;o ari&s;en about the meaning of the word EFFECTS, whether MERCHANDISE was included; and the General being likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible, that the per|mitting articles of that kind to be carried to the rebels, might &s;trengthen them in their re&s;i&s;tance;
<PB N="62" REF="63">
he retained the goods. But they are &s;till &s;afely kept for the owners, &s;hould they either continue faithful, or &s;eize his Maje&s;ty's mercy, and return to their duty.</P>
<P>The next paragraph of the Declaration, as it is not &s;upported by truth, is addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;|&s;ions. The Congre&s;s complain, with an attempt at the pathos, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the &s;eparation of wives from their hu&s;bands, children from their parents, and the aged and &s;ick from their relations and friends."</Q> But is it not notorious to the whole world, that this SEPARATION, which the Con|gre&s;s affect to lament, was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of the rebellion of their countrymen? Did they not &s;urround the town of Bo&s;ton, with an armed force, with the avowed intention of de&s;troy|ing his Maje&s;ty's forces, Generals, and Governor? And were the gates to be left open <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to let ruin enter,"</Q> as one of their own writers ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf? Have the people of Bo&s;ton &s;uf|fered more hard&s;hips than the inhabitants of be|&s;ieged towns u&s;ually &s;uffer? Have they not even &s;uffered &s;ewer re&s;traints than men in their &s;ituation had rea&s;on to expect? Was not Dr. Warren, the Chairman of the Provincial Congre&s;s, a notorious abettor of the in&s;urrection, a nominal General in a rebel army, permitted to come into Bo&s;ton, under
<PB N="63" REF="64">
pretence of vi&s;iting a &s;ick friend, on the day pre|ceding the action on Bunker's-hill, where he was killed in arms again&s;t his King and Country? Is this a mark of tho&s;e cruel re&s;traints, tho&s;e melancholy &s;eparations, of which the Congre&s;s complain? But THEIR bu&s;ine&s;s is to engage the pa&s;&s;ions, where they can make no impre&s;&s;ion with their arguments.</P>
<P>In the next paragraph of their Declaration, the Congre&s;s, with their u&s;ual want of impartiality and fairne&s;s, mention the CONSEQUENCES of their own rebellion, as the cau&s;e of their taking up arms. They ob&s;erve, that General Gage i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"declaring all the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay rebels, &s;u&s;pending the cour&s;e of the Common Law, and publi&s;hing in&s;tead thereof the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the Law Martial."</Q> But, did he declare them rebels till they had at|tacked his Maje&s;ty's troops, &s;eized his forts and garri&s;ons, be&s;ieged his army in the capital of the Province, and not only interrupted the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, but even totally annihilated all legal authority? It is with peculiar effrontery, that the Congre&s;s number the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice among their grievances, after all law and order had been trodden under foot by their own countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
With the &s;ame degree of arrogant folly the Congre&s;s complain, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their countrymen were killed on Bunker's-hill, that Charles-town was burnt to the ground, that their &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els have been &s;eized, that their &s;upplies of provi|&s;ions have been intercepted, that General Carle|ton is in&s;tigating the Canadians and Indians again&s;t them, and that dome&s;tic enemies are en|couraged to attack them."</Q> All the&s;e things may certainly have happened; but have they not happened in con&s;equence of their own rebellion? Have <HI>they</HI> a right to attack others, and have others no right to defend them&s;elves? Do the in|habitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay think, that as they have broken through all the ties that bind the &s;ubject to the Sovereign, the law of nature and of nations ought al&s;o to be &s;u&s;pended to gratify <HI>their</HI> ambition, to flatter <HI>their</HI> folly, to favour <HI>their</HI> extravagant &s;chemes of independence? To the above imaginary catalogue of American grievances, may be oppo&s;ed the ju&s;t complaints of Great-Britain. Have not the rebels carried their ho&s;tilities to every corner again&s;t the Parent-State, that fir&s;t gave them exi&s;tence, and reared them to pro&s;perity? Have they not attacked her troops at Lexington and at Concord, fired upon Bo&s;ton, burnt the Light-hou&s;e, taken Ticonderago and Crown Point, and even penetrated into Canada?
<PB N="65" REF="66">
And have they not u&s;ed every artifice to in&s;tigate the Savages to make war on their Sovereign and Mother-Country? Almo&s;t all the&s;e injuries pre|ceded the ju&s;t exertions of this Kingdom to puni&s;h their rebellion.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the Declaration, though la|boured, contains nothing but empty declamation, and therefore merits little notice. The &s;ame di&s;|regard to truth, or rather the &s;ame attention to mi&s;repre&s;entation, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the re&s;t of that &s;trange compo&s;ition, is carried down to the end. They alledge, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they are reduced to the al|ternative of chu&s;ing an UNCONDITIONAL &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to tyranny, or re&s;i&s;tance by force."</Q> The Congre&s;s &s;urely forget, or it &s;uits THEIR purpo&s;e to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, the favourable (perhaps too favourable) conditions offered to them, by the Re|&s;olution of the Commons, in the month of Fe|bruary la&s;t. The terms couched in that Re&s;olu|tion were &s;o obviou&s;ly advantageous to America, that the Oppo&s;ition in Parliament declared them INSIDIOUS; or, in other words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"too good to be &s;incere."</Q> An amicable &s;ettlement had cea&s;ed to have been an object with the Demagogues ABROAD; and it would have ruined the &s;chemes of the Faction at HOME. The FORMER derived their influence, con&s;equence, and power, from
<PB N="66" REF="67">
anarchy and confu&s;ion. THEY could exi&s;t only in a &s;torm. The re&s;toration of peace and tran|quility mu&s;t have reduced THEM to their original in&s;ignificance; and as for the LATTER, rendered de&s;perate by di&s;appointed ambition, they would not he&s;itate to ruin their Country, to procure the fall of their rivals.</P>
<P>Such being the &s;tate of opinions among the leaders of Faction on both &s;ides of the Atlantic, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"re&s;i&s;tance by force became naturally the choice of the Congre&s;s."</Q> To deceive an unhappy peo|ple, over who&s;e minds they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a tempo|rary dominion, they boa&s;t of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their perfect union, and their great INTERNAL re&s;ources; and that foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is attainable."</Q> As to the fir&s;t, we have no rea&s;on to give it implicit credit. The &s;hew of unanimity, which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in America, appears, from undoubted information, to be the effect of fear, more than any love for the de&s;pe|rate cau&s;e of the rebels. Men of property are, from intere&s;t, enemies to confu&s;ion; and the in|telligent, fore&s;eeing the inevitable i&s;&s;ue of ho&s;tilities again&s;t the invincible power of a mighty Empire, are aver&s;e to a conte&s;t, that, on the &s;ide of the Americans, mu&s;t terminate in ruin. But BOTH are terrified into &s;ilence by the tyranny of a mi&s;led rabble; or their STILL VOICE is drowned in the clamours of Faction and tumult of Party.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">
The INTERNAL RESOURCES of the Americans are as problematical, as their unanimity in rebel|lion. Con&s;i&s;t the&s;e mighty re&s;ources in a wretched Paper-currency, e&s;tabli&s;hed on no o&s;ten&s;ible fund of credit; and voted by an illegal A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e authority is feeble, on account of its novelty, and tran&s;itory, as it ari&s;es from temporary prejudices? Should force, or even folly, &s;tamp a dome&s;tic value on the <HI>pa&s;te-board</HI> dollars of the Congre&s;s, what foreign nation will receive them for its manu|factures and commodities? Are the Americans them&s;elves capable of furni&s;hing all the great implements nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of war? Can they &s;upply their armies with tents, with powder, with cannon, or with mu&s;quets? Is any one of the&s;e articles manufactured in a &s;ufficient quantity in America? And how can they be procured in Europe, with the wretched cur|rency of the General Congre&s;s?</P>
<P>The Coloni&s;ts, had not rea&s;on been warped by prejudice in every part of their conduct, might have fore&s;een, that their commencing a war de|prived them in&s;tantly of the re&s;ources for carrying it on. Their whole Coa&s;t is lined, it is to be hoped, at this very moment, with our &s;hips of war, to put a total &s;top to their Commerce. They have, therefore, lo&s;t at one &s;troke their whole
<PB N="68" REF="69">
trade in Corn and Rice with Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean; which, at a moderate computation, brought annually One Million Five Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds to North America. They have lo&s;t the &s;upplying our own We&s;t-India I&s;lands, as well as tho&s;e of other nations, with provi&s;ions; a branch of Commerce e&s;timated little &s;hort of a Million annually. They have lo&s;t their Fi&s;hery, an article too great for computation; and they have lo&s;t the exportation to Great-Britain of commodities which would not have an&s;wered in any other market, had the &s;ea remained open to their Navigation.</P>
<P>But if the Americans have little rea&s;on to de|pend on DOMESTIC RESOURCES, they have &s;till le&s;s to hope from FOREIGN AID. Will France, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her finances, involve her&s;elf in a ruinous and expen&s;ive war, to gratify the re|venge of a Faction in this Country, or to favour the ambition of Demagogues beyond the Atlantic? Will Spain give her a&s;&s;i&s;tance to rai&s;e an INDEPEN|DENT EMPIRE in America? Will &s;he encourage her own American &s;ubjects to ri&s;e again&s;t her au|thority, by abetting the rebellion of the American &s;ubjects of Great-Britain? Can either Branch of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon be &s;o blind to its own in|tere&s;t, as to wi&s;h to &s;ee a Sovereign State erected

&s;o near its &s;ettlements, which from their proximity, their produce, and their wealth, mu&s;t, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, become objects of inva&s;ion, depredation, and conque&s;t? What has either France or Spain to fear from THIS KINGDOM, who&s;e intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts &s;olely in pre&s;erving what &s;he has already acquired? But have not BOTH every thing to fear, &s;hould a new Sovereignty &s;tart up in America, in which a want of re&s;ources would, in &s;ome degree, ju&s;tify the providing it&s;elf at the expence of wealthy neighbours?</P>
<P>Having endeavoured to terrify Great-Britain with their DOMESTIC re&s;ources and FOREIGN aids; the Congre&s;s thinking, perhaps, they had gone too far, conclude with a&s;&s;urances, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they have not YET determined to di&s;&s;olve their union with the Mother-Country."</Q> But that UNION, it ap|pears from the &s;equel, mu&s;t not be con&s;trued into SUBORDINATION, on the part of the Americans. The general &s;upremacy of the Legi&s;lature, which by pervading the whole Briti&s;h Empire renders it ONE State, mu&s;t not, it &s;eems, cro&s;s the At|lantic, but in &s;uch proportions as may &s;uit the in|clinations of the Congre&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THEY have taken up arms,"</Q> as they openly avow, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"again&s;t that Supremacy;"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THEY will not lay them down till ho&s;tilities &s;hall cea&s;e on the part of Great-Britain."</Q> This is the Ultimatum offered by the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
Congre&s;s: Withdraw your armies, recal your fleets, and you may have peace from the Ameri|cans; for, as <Q REND="inline">"they fight not for conque&s;t,"</Q> they do not YET mean to transfer ho&s;tilities into the heart of the&s;e kingdoms!</P>
<P>The haughty Monarch who dreamt of univer&s;al monarchy in the la&s;t century, could &s;carcely have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in more in&s;olent terms to the petty Princes &s;urrounding his dominions, than the Congre&s;s have done to the powerful Empire to which they owe the allegiance of &s;ubjects. Some allowance ought to be made for THEIR ignorance, and a great deal for the petulance of men new to con&s;equence and authority; but, even in that ca&s;e, the in&s;olence of the Declaration is calculated to rai&s;e indignation, as well as contempt. The Congre&s;s, however, are only the echoes of a de&s;|perate Faction in this Kingdom, who have uni|formly, in their public exhibitions, degraded the &s;trength, power, and authority of Great-Britain, to exalt America on the ruins. With an effron|tery without example in any other age or nation, THESE MEN a&s;&s;ume the name of Patriots, yet lay the honour, dignity, and reputation of their Country under the feet of her rebellious &s;ubjects. With a peculiar refinement on Parricide, they bind the hands of the MOTHER, while they plant a
<PB N="71" REF="72">
dagger in tho&s;e of the DAUGHTER, to &s;tab her to the heart; and to fini&s;h the horrid picture, they &s;mile at the mi&s;chief they have done, and look round to the &s;pectators for applau&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears, upon the whole, that the Declara|tion, which ought to contain all the argument in favour of the Americans, contains, in fact, no|thing that does not militate again&s;t their cau&s;e. The right of taxing all the &s;ubjects of the Em|pire, for the general &s;upport of the State, is a part of that Supremacy which the fir&s;t principles of the Con&s;titution have ve&s;ted in the Briti&s;h Legi&s;la|ture. This Supremacy has been exerted by Par|liament, and admitted by the Americans, ever &s;ince their ance&s;tors migrated from the&s;e kingdoms. If they now deny it, by that very act they cea&s;e to be &s;ubjects, and become rebels. But granting, for the &s;ake of argument, that Taxation is no part of the &s;upremacy of Parliament, the very conduct of the Americans not only ju&s;tifies, but even renders it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that a precedent &s;hould be made. They own, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that their internal re&s;ources are great."</Q> The inability of con|tributing to the nece&s;&s;ities of a State, from whom they have derived their origin, their &s;upport, their protection, and their pro&s;perity, is no longer a pretence; and if they will give no Revenue as
<PB N="72" REF="73">
&s;ubjects, they owe a debt as allies. They affect to maintain armies by land. They threaten to &s;end fleets to &s;ea. They alledge, that their re&s;ources are capable of &s;upporting a rebellion again&s;t the Mo|ther-Country; yet they ju&s;tify that rebellion by the demand made by the Mother-Country, for their bearing a part of their own FUTURE EXPENCES.</P>
<P>That the FORMER expences of America have drawn from Great-Britain an incredible trea&s;ure, may be &s;een from the following authentic e&s;timate. We &s;hall begin this e&s;timate with the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Hanover to the Throne of the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>

To this amazing &s;um might be added, by implication, the other expences of the two la&s;t Wars. The FORMER of tho&s;e wars was undertaken for the protection of the American Commerce, or rather American SMUGGLING, to the Spani&s;h Co|lonies. We entered into the LATTER for the defence of the Coloni&s;ts; we carried it on for their &s;ecurity; and terminated it for their SOLE advan|tage. The two la&s;t Wars have co&s;t this Country, at a moderate computation, ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS. To this extraordinary wa&s;te of trea&s;ure, what have the Colonies to oppo&s;e to balance the account? Is it a languid Com|merce, which &s;carcely makes its returns once in three years?</P>
<P>We have heard much (indeed, a great deal too much) of this Commerce from factious men on both &s;ides of the Atlantic. This is the mighty engine which they wield over the heads of the ignorant; the great bug-bear with which they terrify the timid. To e&s;timate the value of the American trade with any degree of preci&s;ion, is impo&s;&s;ible. The accounts kept in the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e are no authorities. When exports pay no duty, a door is opened to fal&s;e entries. The
<PB N="74" REF="75">
vanity of &s;ome Merchants, the intere&s;t of others, too frequently induce them to magnify, beyond mea&s;ure, the quantity of their export trade. Be|&s;ides, the mercantile abettors of American re&s;i&s;t|ance thought they &s;erved the Colonies, whil&s;t they gratified their own private views. We may con|clude, that the Commerce with North America has been greatly over-rated, as the TOTAL LOSS of it has NOT affected this Kingdom. We ought, per|haps, to a&s;cribe to ITS INSIGNIFICANCE what we are taught to attribute to an INCREASE in other channels of trade.</P>
<P>Like all monopolies, the Commerce with North-America, &s;uch as it has been, was much more pro|fitable to the Merchant, than advantageous to the Manufacturer. One-third of this commerce with any State in Europe (from which the returns are an|nual) would have brought equal profit to the ma|nufacturer, and would have enabled him to em|ploy an equal number of hands. Political im|po&s;tors will not fail to advance magnificent fictions on this head, and the ignorant cannot cea&s;e to give them credit. On a &s;ubject where proofs are &s;o diffi|cult to be obtained, one may hazard a conjecture. The money expended by this Nation upon America,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
for the PROTECTION of HER inhabitants and the ENCOURAGEMENT of HER Commerce, would have been more than &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e ALL the manufactures ever exported from Great-Britain to the Colonies now in rebellion. I mean not to include, in this conjectural e&s;timate, any &s;ums ex|pended by us in any OTHER part of the world during the two la&s;t (truly American) Wars.</P>
<P>The Americans, with a degree of folly &s;carce excu&s;eable in the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ignorance, claim a merit with Great-Britain, for the Revenue ari&s;ing from impo&s;ts laid upon &s;ome of their com|modities, in THIS Kingdom. The chief of the&s;e are Rice and Tobacco. The Revenue ari&s;ing from Rice is &s;o in&s;ignificant, that it &s;carce de&s;erves to be mentioned. If exported to the &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre, Rice pays no duty at all. The con|&s;umption here and the re-exportation to the North|ward are very incon&s;iderable. In like manner, Tobacco, when re-exported, pays no duty; and it is a matter of great doubt, whether the frauds committed in the draw-backs may not nearly bal|lance the o&s;ten&s;ible Revenue ari&s;ing to the State from the home con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">
But granting, a great Revenue &s;hould ari&s;e from Rice and Tobacco to the State, what favour do we owe to our Colonies on that head? That Re|venue is paid by OURSELVES. The Tax is on the Con&s;umer, and not upon the Planter. Should Siberia &s;upply us with Rice and Tobacco, the price would not probably be greater to the Con|&s;umer, nor the Revenue le&s;s to the State. If the Americans claim any merit from tho&s;e Taxes, what do we NOT owe to the Emperor of China? The Revenue from Tea is much more con&s;ider|able than that from Rice and Tobacco. A Con|gre&s;s at Pekin might accu&s;e us of ingratitude on this &s;ubject, with as much ju&s;tice as the A&s;&s;embly lately &s;itting at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It is evident, from the above &s;tate of facts, that the Colonies have no claim to an exemption from Taxation, on account of any advantage that has accrued to this country from their commerce. But Taxation has now cea&s;ed to be any part of the di&s;pute. It goes to the whole authority of the Mother-Country. The Americans offer no longer the very name of Obedience. But why &s;hould I &s;peak of Obedience? This VERY CONGRESS, who&s;e Declara|tion is the &s;ubject of this di&s;qui&s;ition, have pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="77" REF="78">
a VOTE OF INDEPENDENCE. They have long acted as rebels, they NOW affect to contend as enemies. Their abettors in this Kingdom are no &s;trangers to this circum&s;tance; yet they dignify avowed re|bellion with the title of <Q REND="inline">"A GLORIOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the conduct of the Americans, to which that of Great-Britain has all along formed a &s;trik|ing contra&s;t. With the indulgence and patience of a Parent, &s;he &s;oothed, flattered, and even court|ed them to a reconciliation. In pity to the weakne&s;s, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the folly, in con&s;idera|tion to the prejudices of a froward child, &s;he held out the olive branch when &s;he ought, perhaps, to have &s;tretched forth the rod of correction. Her pity, her kindne&s;s, and affection, were lo&s;t upon the Ameri|cans. They advanced rapidly from claim to claim, and con&s;trued her forbearance into timidity. Each Act that was repealed furni&s;hed a &s;ubject for tri|umph, and not an object for gratitude. Each con|ce&s;&s;ion became the foundation of &s;ome new de|mand, till, at length, by a&s;&s;uming all to them|&s;elves by rebellion, they left the Mother-Country nothing to be&s;tow.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">
In this &s;ituation of affairs, Great-Britain mu&s;t pur&s;ue one of two lines of conduct, with regard to her refractory Colonies. She mu&s;t either put up with the lo&s;s of ALL her expence, and emancipate them for ever, or reduce them to that &s;tate of dependence which &s;ubjects owe to the &s;upreme au|thority in every Empire. As the latter line mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be pur&s;ued, it ought to be pur&s;ued with a mixture of &s;pirit and prudence. To be in every re&s;pect in a condition to force equitable terms, is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for their being vo|luntarily offered. But &s;hould terms be offered by the rebels, the RIGHTS of THIS COUNTRY mu&s;t be more regarded in the accommodation, than the CLAIMS of AMERICA. To permit the Colonies to GAIN by one rebellion, is to &s;ow the &s;eeds of another. But if the Colonies, as communities, are not permitted to <HI>gain</HI> by their refractory conduct, I am far from wi&s;hing that individuals &s;hould <HI>lo&s;e</HI> any part of their rights as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To propo&s;e a plan to the Americans, in their pre|&s;ent political frenzy, would be to &s;peak to the winds. To make them <HI>le&s;s</HI> free than the other &s;ubjects of the State, can never be the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of this Country. To obtain <HI>greater</HI> privileges, can
<PB N="79" REF="80">
&s;carcely be their own <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propo&s;e the conditions on which they wi&s;h to continue &s;ubjects. But if they are to continue &s;ubjects, they mu&s;t perform their duty as &s;uch, and con|tribute toward the expence of the State, for the general protection. The Legi&s;lature of this King|dom cannot po&s;&s;ibly depart from any part of its &s;u|premacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to &s;hare in that &s;upremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the pri|vilege of &s;ending Members to Parliament, let them be repre&s;ented. Nay, more: Let their repre&s;entation increa&s;e in proportion to the Revenue they &s;hall furni&s;h. If they wi&s;h rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general &s;upply, through their own General Courts and A&s;&s;emblies, the re&s;olution of Parliament on that &s;ubject is &s;till open to their choice.</P>
<P>But as long as they a&s;&s;ume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation, can meet no compromi&s;e. Nations, as well as individuals, have a character, a certain dignity, which they mu&s;t pre&s;erve at the ri&s;que of their exi&s;tence. Great-Britain has obeyed the
<PB N="80" REF="81">
dictates of humanity beyond the limits pre&s;cribed by her reputation. To tempt her further, is full of peril, as her indignation begins to ri&s;e. She has long had rea&s;on to complain of American in|gratitude; and &s;he will not bear longer with American inju&s;tice. The dangerous re&s;entment of a great people is ready to bur&s;t forth. They already begin to a&s;k, with vehemence, Is this the return we ought to expect from Colonies, whom with parental indulgence we have cheri&s;hed in infancy, protected in youth, and reared to man|hood? Have we &s;pent in their cau&s;e &s;o much trea&s;ure, and have they the ingratitude to refu&s;e to bear a &s;mall portion of our burdens? Have we &s;pilt &s;o much of the blood of their enemies, and do they repay us by imbruing their hands in our own? The law of God and of Nature is on the &s;ide of an indulgent Parent, again&s;t an undu|tiful Child; and &s;hould nece&s;&s;ary correction render him incapable of future offence, he has only his own ob&s;tinacy and folly to blame.</P>

<HEAD>A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA, NOW MET IN GENERAL CONGRESS AT PHILADELPHIA, SETTING FORTH THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF THEIR TAKING UP ARMS.</HEAD>
<P>IF it was po&s;&s;ible for men who exerci&s;e their rea&s;on to believe, that the Divine Author of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">xi&s;tence in|tended a part of the human race to hold an ab&s;olute pro|perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom as the objects of a legal domination, never rightfully re&s;i&s;tible, however &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive; the inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies might at lea&s;t require from the Parliament of Great Bri|tain &s;ome evidence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our Great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t convince all tho&s;e who reflect upon the &s;ubject, that Government was in&s;titut|ed to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be
<PB N="86" REF="88">
admini&s;tered for the attainment of that end. The Legi|&s;lature of Great Britain, however, &s;timulated by an in|ordinate pa&s;&s;ion for a power not only unju&s;tifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">itution of that Kingdom, and de&s;perate of &s;uc|ce&s;s in any mode of conte&s;t, where regard &s;hould be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, de&s;erting tho&s;e, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpo&s;e of en&s;laving the&s;e Colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for us to clo&s;e with their la&s;t ap|peal from rea&s;on to arms.&mdash;Yet, however blinded that A&s;&s;embly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimit|ed domination, &s;o to &s;light ju&s;tice and the opinion of mankind, we e&s;teem our&s;elves bound by obligations of re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the world, to make known the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Our forefathers, inhabitants of the i&s;land of Great Britain, left their native land, to &s;eek on the&s;e &s;hores a re&s;idence for civil and religious freedom. At the ex|pence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the lea&s;t charge to the country from which they removed, by uncea&s;ing labour, and an unconquerable &s;pirit, they effected &s;ettlements in the di&s;tant and inho&s;|pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or go|vernments, ve&s;ted with perfect legi&s;latures, were formed under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious in|tercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Colonies and the Kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this un on became in a &s;hort time &s;o extraordinary, as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment. It is uni|ver&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed, that the amazing increa&s;e of the wealth, &s;trength, and navigation of the realm aro&s;e from this &s;ource; and the Mini&s;ter who &s;o wi&s;ely and &s;ucce&s;sfully directed the mea&s;ures of Great Bri|tain in the late war, publickly declared, that the&s;e Colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies.&mdash;Towards the conclu&s;ion of that war it plea&s;ed our Sovereign to make a change in his Councils.&mdash;From that fatal moment the affairs of the Briti&s;h Empire be|gan to fall into confu&s;ion, and gradually &s;liding from the &s;ummit of glorious pro&s;perity, to which they had
<PB N="87" REF="89">
been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at length di&s;tracted by the convul&s;ions that now &s;hake it to its deepe&s;t foundation. The new Mini&s;try finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently de&s;eated, yet &s;till contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a ha&s;ty peace, and of then &s;ubduing her faithful friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e devoted Colonies were judged to be in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to pre&s;ent victories without blood&s;hed, and all the ea&s;y emoluments of &s;tatuteable plunder. The un|interrupted tenor of their peaccable and re&s;pectful be|haviour from the beginning of Colonization, their du|tiful, zealous, and u&s;eful &s;ervices during the war, tho' &s;o recently and amply acknowledged in the mo&s;t ho|nourable manner by his Maje&s;ty, by the late King, and by Parliament, could not &s;ave them from the medi|tated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project, and a&s;&s;uming a new power over them, have, in the cour&s;e of eleven years, given &s;uch deci&s;ive &s;pecimens of the &s;pirit and con&s;equences attend|ing this power, as to leave no doubt concerning the ef|fects of acquie&s;cence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our con&s;ent, tho' we have ever exerci&s;ed an exclu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of our own property. Statutes have been pa&s;&s;ed for extend|ing the juri&s;diction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their antient limits, for depriving us of the accu&s;tomed and ine&s;timable privilege of trial by Jury in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; for &s;u&s;|pending the legi&s;lature of one of the Colonies; for in|terdicting all commerce of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of government, e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, and &s;ecured by Acts of its own Legi&s;lature &s;o|lemnly confirmed by the Crown; for exempting the <Q REND="inline">"Murderers"</Q> of Coloni&s;ts from legal trial, and, in effect, from puni&s;hment; for erecting in a neighbour|ing Province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Bri|tain and America, a de&s;poti&s;m dangerous to our very ex|i&s;tence; and for quartering &s;oldiers upon the Coloni&s;ts in time of profound peace. It has al&s;o been re&s;olved in Parliament, that Coloni&s;ts charged with committing
<PB N="88" REF="90">
certain offences, &s;hall be tran&s;ported to England to be tried.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one Statute it is declared, that Parliament can <Q REND="inline">"of right make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever."</Q> What is to defend us again&s;t &s;o enormous, &s;o unlimit|ed a power? Not a &s;ingle man of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume it, is cho&s;en by us, or is &s;ubject to our controul or in|fluence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them ex|empt from the operation of &s;uch laws; and an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion as they increa&s;e ours. We &s;aw the mi&s;ery to which &s;uch de&s;poti&s;m would reduce us. We for ten years ince&s;&s;antly and ineffectually be&s;ieged the Throne as &s;upplicants; we rea&s;oned, we remon&s;trated with Parliament in the mo&s;t mild and decent language. But Admini&s;tration, &s;en&s;ible that we &s;hould regard the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures as freemen ought to do, &s;ent over fleets and armies to enforce them. The indignation of the Americans was rou&s;ed, it is true; but it was the in|dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Congre&s;s of Delegates from the United Colonies was a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of la&s;t Septem|ber. We re&s;olved again to offer an humble and duti|ful Petition to the King, and al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed our fel|low-&s;ubjects of Great-Britain. We have pur&s;ued every temperate, every re&s;pectful mea&s;ure; we have even pro|ceeded to break off our commercial intercour&s;e with our fellow-&s;ubjects, as the la&s;t peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth &s;hould &s;up|plant our attachment to liberty. This we flattered our|&s;elves was the ultimate &s;tep of the controver&s;y; but the &s;ub&s;equent events have &s;hewn, how vain is this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.</P>
<P>Several threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Colonies were in&s;erted in his Maje&s;ty's Speech. Our Petition, though we were told it was a decent one, that his Ma|je&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to receive it graciou&s;ly, and to promi&s;e laying it before his Parliament, was huddled in|to
<PB N="89" REF="91">
both Hou&s;es among&s;t a bundle of American papers, and there neglected. The Lords and Commons in their Addre&s;s, in the month of February, &s;aid, That <Q REND="inline">"a re|bellion at that time actually exi&s;ted within the Province of Ma&s;&s;chu&s;et's Bay; and that tho&s;e concerned in it had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combi|nations and engagements, entered into by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in &s;everal of the other Colonies; and therefore they be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, that he would take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the Supreme Legi&s;lature."</Q> Soon after the commercial intercour&s;e of whole Colonies, with fo|reign cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">tries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act of Parliament by another, &s;everal of them were entirely pro&s;cribed from the fi&s;heries in the &s;eas near their coa&s;ts, on which they always depended for their &s;u&s;tenance; and large reinforcements of &s;hips and troops were im|mediately &s;ent over to General Gage.</P>
<P>Fruitle&s;s were all the entreaties, arguments and elo|quence of an illu&s;trious band of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Peers and Commoners, who nobly and &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, to &s;tay or even to mitigate the heedle&s;s fury with which the&s;e accumulated and unexam|pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitle&s;s was the interference of the City of London, of Bri&s;tol, and many other re&s;pectable towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted an in&s;idious manoeuvre, calculated to divide us, to e&s;tabli&s;h a perpetual auction of taxations, where Colony &s;hould bid again&s;t Colony, all of them uninformed what ran&s;om &s;hould redeem their lives, and thus to extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown &s;ums that &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gratify, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify, Mi|ni&s;terial rapacity, with the mi&s;erable indulgence left to us of rai&s;ing in our own mode the pre&s;cribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remor&s;ele&s;s victors to conquered enemies? In our circum&s;tances, to accept them would be to de&s;erve them.</P>
<P>Soon after the intelligence of the&s;e proceedings arrived on this Continent, General Gage, who in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="90" REF="92">
the la&s;t year had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay, and &s;till occupied it as a garri&s;on, on the 19th day of April &s;ent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault on the inhabitants of the &s;aid prevince, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom were officers and &s;oldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they &s;et upon another party of the in|habitants of the &s;ame Province, killing &s;everal, and wounded more, until compelled to retreat by the coun|try people &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled to repel this cruel aggre&s;|&s;ion. Ho&s;tilities thus commenced by the Briti&s;h troops, have been &s;ince pro&s;ecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Bo&s;ton being confined within that town by the General their Gover|nor, and having in order to procure their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion en|tered into a treaty with him, it was &s;tipulated that the &s;aid inhabitants, having depo&s;ited their arms with their own Magi&s;trates, &s;hould have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly deli|vered up their arms; but in open violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even &s;a|vage nations e&s;teem &s;acred, the Governor ordered the arms depo&s;ited as afore&s;aid, that they might be pre&s;erved for their owners, to be &s;eized by a body of &s;oldiers; de|tained the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their mo&s;t valuable effects behind.</P>
<P>By this perfidy wives are &s;eparated from their hu&s;bands, children from their parents, the aged and &s;ick from their relations and friends, who wi&s;h to attend and comfort them; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to live in plenty, and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The General, further emulating his Mini&s;terial ma|&s;ters, by a proclamation, bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods and calum|nies again&s;t the good people of the&s;e Colonies, proceeds
<PB N="91" REF="93">
to <Q REND="inline">"declare them all, either by name or de&s;cription, to be rebels and traitors, to &s;uper&s;ede the cour&s;e of the common law, and in&s;tead thereof to publi&s;h and order the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the law martial."</Q>&mdash;His troops have butchered our countrymen; have wantonly burnt Charles Town, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of hou&s;es in other places; our &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els are &s;eized; the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ions are intercepted, and he is exerting his utmo&s;t power to &s;pread de&s;truction and deva&s;tation around him.</P>
<P>We have received certain intelligence, that General Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is in&s;tigating the people of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us; and we have but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that &s;chemes have been formed to excite dome&s;tic enemies again&s;t us. In brief, a part of the&s;e Colonies now feels, and all of them are &s;ure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of Admini&s;tration can inflict them, the complicated cala|mities of fire, &s;word and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chu&s;ing an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tyranny of irritated Mini&s;ters, or re&s;i&s;tance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the co&s;t of this conte&s;t, and find nothing &s;o dreadful as voluntary &s;lavery. Honour, ju&s;tice and humanity, forbid us tamely to &s;urrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ance&s;tors, and which our innocent po&s;terity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infa|my and guilt of re&s;igning &s;ucceeding generations to that wretchedne&s;s which inevitably awaits them, if we ba&s;ely entail hereditary bondage upon them.</P>
<P>Our cau&s;e is ju&s;t: our union is perfect: our internal re&s;ources are great, and if nece&s;&s;ary, foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as &s;ignal in&s;tances of Divine favour towards us, that his Pro|vidence would not permit us to be called into this &s;evere controver&s;y, until we were grown up to our pre&s;ent &s;trength, had been previou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in warlike opera|tions, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of defending our&s;elves. With hearts fortified with the&s;e animating reflections, we mo&s;t &s;olemnly before God and the world declare, that, exerting the utmo&s;t energy of tho&s;e powers which our beneficent Creator hath graciou&s;ly be&s;towed upon us,
<PB N="92" REF="94">
the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to a&s;|&s;ume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with un|abating firmne&s;s and per&s;everance, employ for the pre|&s;ervation of our liberties, being with one mind re&s;olved to die freemen rather than to live &s;laves.</P>
<P>Le&s;t this Declaration &s;hould di&s;quiet the minds of our friends and fellow &s;ubjects in any part of the empire, we a&s;&s;ure them, that we mean not to di&s;&s;olve that union which has &s;o long and &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and which we &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee re&s;tored. Nece&s;&s;ity has not yet driven us into that de&s;perate mea&s;ure, or in|duced us to excite any other nation to war again&s;t them. We have not rai&s;ed armies with ambitious de|&s;igns of &s;eparating from Great Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing independant &s;tates. We fight not for glory or for con|que&s;t. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable &s;pectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation, or even &s;u&s;picion of offence. They boa&s;t of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than &s;ervitude or death.</P>
<P>In our own native land, in defence of the free|dom that is our birthright, and which we ever en|joyed till the late violation of it; for the protection of our property, acquired &s;olely by the hone&s;t indu&s;try of our forefathers and our&s;elves, again&s;t violence actually offer|ed, we have taken up arms. We &s;hall lay them down when ho&s;tilities &s;hall cea&s;e on the part of the aggre&s;&s;ors, and all danger of their being renewed &s;hall be removed,&mdash;and not before.</P>
<P>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the Supreme and Impartial Judge and Ruler of the Univer&s;e, we mo&s;t devoutly implore his divine goodne&s;s to conduct us hap|pily through this great conflict, to di&s;po&s;e our adver&s;a|ries to reconciliation on rea&s;onable terms, and thereby to relieve the Empire from the calamities of civil war.</P>
