<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the republic of letters, there is no member of &s;uch inferior rank, or who is &s;o much di&s;|dained by his brethren of the quill, as the humble Noveli&s;t: nor is his fate le&s;s hard in the world at large, &s;ince, among the whole cla&s;s of writers, perhaps not one can be named, of whom the votaries are more numerous, but le&s;s re&s;pect|able.</P>
<P>Yet, while in the annals of tho&s;e few of our predece&s;&s;ors, to whom this &s;pecies of writing is indebted for being &s;aved from contempt, and re&s;|cued from depravity, we can trace &s;uch names as Rou&s;&s;eau, John&s;on, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However &s;uperior the capacities in which the&s;e great writers de&s;erve to be con&s;idered, they mu&s;t par|don me that, for the dignity of my &s;ubject, I here rank the authors of Ra&s;&s;elas and Elo&iuml;&s;e as Noveli&s;ts.</NOTE> Marivaux, Fielding, Ri|chard&s;on, and Smollet, no man need blu&s;h at

&s;tarting from the &s;ame po&s;t, though many, nay, mo&s;t men, may &s;igh at finding them&s;elves di|&s;tanced.</P>
<P>The following letters are pre&s;ented to the public&mdash;for &s;uch, by novel writers, novel read|ers will be called,&mdash;with a very &s;ingular mix|ture of timidity and confidence, re&s;ulting from the peculiar &s;ituation of the editor, who, though trembling for their &s;ucce&s;s from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their imperfections, yet fears not being in|volved in their di&s;grace, while happily wrapped up in a mantle of impenetrable ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>To draw characters from nature, though not from life, and to mark the manners of the times, is the attempted plan of the following letters. For this purpo&s;e, a young female, educated in the mo&s;t &s;ecluded retirement, makes, at the age of &s;eventeen, her fir&s;t appearance upon the great and bu&s;y &s;tage of life; with a virtuous mind, a cultivated under&s;tanding, and a feeling heart, her ignorance of the forms, and inexperience in the manners, of the world, occa&s;ion all the little incidents which the&s;e volumes record, and which form the natural progre&s;&s;ion of the life of a young woman of ob&s;cure birth, but con&s;picuous beauty, for the fir&s;t &s;ix months after her <HI>En|trance into the World.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps were it po&s;&s;ible to effect the total extirpation of novels, our young ladies in gene|ral,
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
and boarding-&s;chool dam&s;els in particular, might profit from their annihilation: but &s;ince the di&s;temper they have &s;pread &s;eems incurable, &s;ince their contagion bids defiance to the medicine of advice or reprehen&s;ion, and &s;ince they are found to baffle all the mental art of phy&s;ic, &s;ave what is pre&s;cribed by the &s;low regimen of Time, and bitter diet of Experience, &s;urely all attempts to contribute to the number of tho&s;e which may be read, if not with advantage, at lea&s;t without injury, ought rather to be encouraged than con|temned.</P>
<P>Let me, therefore, prepare for d&s;iappointment tho&s;e who, in the peru&s;al of the&s;e &s;heets, enter|tain the gentle expectation of being tran&s;ported to the fanta&s;tic regions of Romance, where Fiction is coloured by all the gay tints of luxurious Ima|gination, where Rea&s;on is an outca&s;t, and where the &s;ublimity of <HI>the Marvellous</HI> rejects all aid from &s;ober Probability. The heroine of the&s;e memoirs, young, artle&s;s, and inexperienced, is
<Q><L>No faultle&s;s Mon&s;ter, that the World ne'er &s;aw,</L></Q>
but the offspring of Nature, and of Nature in her &s;imple&s;t attire.</P>
<P>In all the Arts, the value of copies can only be proportioned to the &s;carcene&s;s of originals: among &s;culptors and painters, a fine &s;tatue, or a beautiful picture, of &s;ome great ma&s;ter, may de|&s;ervedly employ the imitative talents of younger and inferior arti&s;ts, that their appropriation to
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
one &s;pot, may not wholly prevent the more ge|neral expan&s;ion of their excellence; but, among authors, the rever&s;e is the ca&s;e, &s;ince the noble&s;t productions of literature, are almo&s;t equally at|tainable with the meane&s;t. In books, therefore, imitation cannot be &s;hunned too &s;edulou&s;ly; for the very perfection of a model which is frequent|ly &s;een, &s;erves but more forcibly to mark the in|feriority of a copy.</P>
<P>To avoid what is common, without adopting what is unnatural, mu&s;t limit the ambition of the vulgar herd of authors: however zealous, therefore, my veneration of the great writers I have mentioned, however 1 may feel my&s;elf en|lightened by the knowledge of John&s;on, charmed with the eloquence of Rou&s;&s;eau, &s;oftened by the pathetic powers of Richard&s;on, and exhilarated by the wit of Fielding, and humour of Smollet; I yet pre&s;ume not to attempt pur&s;uing the &s;ame ground which they have tracked; whence, though they may have cleared the weeds, they have al&s;o culled the flowers, and though they have rendered the path plain, they have left it barren.</P>
<P>The candour of my readers, I have not the impertinence to doubt, and to their indulgence, I am &s;en&s;ible I have no claim: I have, there|fore, only to entreat, that my own words may not pronounce my condemnation, and that what I have here ventured to &s;ay in regard to imita|tion, may be under&s;tood, as it is meant, in a ge|neral
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
&s;en&s;e, and not be imputed to an opinion of my own originality, which I have not the vanity, the folly, or the blindne&s;s, to entertain.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the fate of the&s;e letters, the editor is &s;atisfied they will meet with ju&s;|tice; and commits them to the pre&s;s, though hopele&s;s of fame, yet not regardle&s;s of cen|&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady Howard to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Howard Grove.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CAN there, my good Sir, be any thing more painful to a friendly mind, than a nece&s;&s;ity of com|municating di&s;agreeable intelligence? Indeed, it is &s;ometimes difficult to determine, whether the rela|tor or the receiver of evil tidings is mo&s;t to be pitied.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t had a letter from Madame Duval; &s;he is totally at a lo&s;s in what manner to behave; &s;he &s;eems de&s;irous to repair the wrongs &s;he has done, yet wi&s;hes the world to believe her blame|le&s;s. She would fain ca&s;t upon another the odium of tho&s;e misfortunes for which &s;he alone is an&s;wer|able. Her letter is violent, &s;ometimes abu&s;ive, and that of <HI>you!&mdash;you,</HI> to whom &s;he is under obliga|tions which are greater even than her faults, but to who&s;e advice &s;he wickedly imputes all the &s;uf|ferings of her much injured daughter, the late Lady Belmont. The chief purport of her writing I will acquaint you with; the letter it&s;elf is not worthy your notice.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="17">
She tells me that &s;he has, for many years pa&s;t, been in continual expectation of making a journey to England, which prevented her writing for in|formation concerning this melancholy &s;ubject, by giving her hopes of making per&s;onal enquiries; but family occurrences have &s;till detained her in France, which country &s;he now &s;ees no pro&s;pect of quitting. She has, therefore, lately u&s;ed her ut|mo&s;t endeavours to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her <HI>ill-advi&s;ed</HI> daughter; the re&s;ult of which giving her <HI>&s;ome rea&s;on</HI> to apprehend that, upon her death bed, &s;he bequeathed an infant orphan to the world, &s;he mo&s;t graciou&s;ly &s;ays that if <HI>you,</HI> with whom <HI>&s;he under&s;tands</HI> the child is pla|ced, will procure authentic proofs of its relation|&s;hip to her, you may &s;end it to Paris, where &s;he will properly provide for it.</P>
<P>This woman is, undoubtedly, at length, con|&s;cious of her mo&s;t unnatural conduct: it is evident, from her writing, that &s;he is &s;till as vulgar and illi|terate as when her fir&s;t hu&s;band, Mr. Evelyn, had the weakne&s;s to marry her; nor does &s;he at all apo|logi&s;e for addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, though I was only once in her company.</P>
<P>This letter has excited in my daughter Mirvan, a &s;trong de&s;ire to be informed of the motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon the unfortu|nate Lady Belmont, at a time when a mother's pro|tection was &s;o peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for her peace and her reputation. Notwith&s;tanding I was per|&s;onally acquainted with all the parties concerned in that affair, the &s;ubject always appeared of too de|licate a nature to be &s;poken of with the principals; I cannot, therefore, &s;atisfy Mrs. Mirvan otherwi&s;e than by applying to you.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="18">
By &s;aying that you <HI>may</HI> &s;end the child, Madame Duval aims at <HI>conferring,</HI> where &s;he mo&s;t <HI>owes</HI> obli|gation. I pretend not to give you advice; you, to who&s;e generous protection this helple&s;s orphan is indebted for every thing, are the be&s;t and only judge of what &s;he ought to do; but I am much concern|ed for the trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s which this unwor|thy woman may occa&s;ion you.</P>
<P>My daughter and my grandchild join with me in de&s;iring to be mo&s;t kindly remembered to the amiable girl; and they bid me remind you, that the annual vi&s;it to Howard Grove, which we were formerly promi&s;ed, has been di&s;continued for more than four years.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Lady Howard.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, Dor&s;et&s;hire.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lady&s;hip did but too well fore&s;ee the perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s of which Madame Du|val's letter has been productive. However, I ought rather to be thankful that I have &s;o many years remained unmole&s;ted, than repine at my pre|&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ment; &s;ince it proves, at lea&s;t, that this wretched woman is at length awakened to re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P>In regard to my an&s;wer, I mu&s;t humbly reque&s;t your Lady&s;hip to write to this effect: <Q REND="inline">"That I would not, upon any account, intentionally offend Madame Duval, but that I have weighty, nay un|an&s;werable
<PB N="4" REF="19">
rea&s;ons for detaining her grand-daughter at pre&s;ent in England; the principal of which is, that it was the earne&s;t de&s;ire of one to who&s;e will &s;he owes implicit duty. Madame Duval may be a&s;&s;ured that &s;he meets with the utmo&s;t attention and tenderne&s;s; that her education, however &s;hort of my wi&s;hes, almo&s;t exceeds my abilities; and that I flatter my&s;elf, when the time arrives that &s;he &s;hall pay her duty to her grand-mother, Madame Duval will find no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with what has been done for her."</Q></P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will not, I am &s;ure, be &s;urpri&s;ed at this an&s;wer. Madame Duval is by no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman: &s;he is at once uneducated and unprincipled; ungen|tle in her temper, and unamiable in her manners. I have long known that &s;he has per&s;uaded her&s;elf to harbour an aver&s;ion for me&mdash;Unhappy woman! I can only regard her as an object of pity!</P>
<P>I dare not he&s;itate at a reque&s;t from Mrs. Mir|van, yet, in complying with it, I &s;hall, for her own &s;ake, be as conci&s;e as I po&s;&s;ibly can; &s;ince the cruel tran&s;actions which preceded the birth of my ward, can afford no entertainment to a mind &s;o humane as her's.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip may probably have heard, that I had the honour to accompany Mr. Evelyn, the grand-father of my young charge, when upon his travels, in capacity of tutor. His unhappy mar|riage, immediately upon his return to England, with Madame Duval, then a waiting-girl at a ta|vern, contrary to the advice and entreaties of all his friends, among whom I was my&s;elf the mo&s;t ur|gent to di&s;&s;uade him, induced him to abandon his native land, and fix his abode in France. Thither he was followed by &s;hame and repentance; feelings
<PB N="5" REF="20">
which his heart was not formed to &s;upport: for, notwith&s;tanding he had been too weak to re&s;i&s;t the allurements of beauty, which nature, though a niggard to her of every other boon, had with a la|vi&s;h hand be&s;towed on his wife; yet he was a young man of excellent character, and, till thus unac|countably infatuated, of unblemi&s;hed conduct. He &s;urvived this ill-judged marriage but two years. Upon his death-bed, with an un&s;teady hand, he wrote me the following note:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My friend! forget your re&s;entment, in favour of your humanity;&mdash;a father, trembling for the welfare of his child, bequeaths her to your care.&mdash;O Villars! hear! pity! and relieve me!"</Q></P>
<P>Had my circum&s;tances permitted, I &s;hould have an&s;wered the&s;e words by an immediate journey to Paris; but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend, who was upon the &s;pot, and pre&s;ent at the opening of the will.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thou&s;and pounds, and the &s;ole guardian&s;hip of his daughter's per&s;on till her eighteenth year, conjuring me, in the mo&s;t affecting terms, to take the charge of her education till &s;he was able to act with propriety for her&s;elf; but in regard to fortune, he left her wholly dependent on her mother, to who&s;e tenderne&s;s he earne&s;tly recommended her.</P>
<P>Thus, though he would not, to a woman low|bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn, tru&s;t the mind and morals of his daughter, he neverthele&s;s thought proper to &s;ecure to her that re&s;pect and duty which, from her own child, were certainly her due; but, unhappily, it never occurred to him that the mo|ther, on her part, could fail in affection or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Evelyn, Madam, from the &s;econd to the eighteenth year of her life, was brought up under
<PB N="6" REF="21">
my care, and, except when at &s;chool, under my roof. I need not &s;peak to your Lady&s;hip of the virtues of that excellent young creature. She loved me as her father; nor was Mrs. Villars le&s;s valued by her; while to me &s;he became &s;o dear, that her lo&s;s was little le&s;s afflicting to me than that which I have &s;ince &s;u&s;tained of Mrs. Villars her&s;elf.</P>
<P>At that period of her life we parted; her mo|ther, then married to Mon&s;ieur Duval, &s;ent for her to Paris. How often have I &s;ince regretted that I did not accompany her thither! protected and &s;upported by me, the mi&s;ery and di&s;grace which awaited her, might, perhaps, have been avoided. But&mdash;to be brief, Madame Duval, at the in&s;tiga|tion of her hu&s;band, earne&s;tly, or rather tyran|nically, endeavoured to effect an union between Mi&s;s Evelyn and one of his nephews. And, when &s;he found her power inadequate to her attempt, enraged at her non-compliance, &s;he treated her with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t unkindne&s;s, and threatened her with poverty and ruin.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Evelyn, to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been &s;trangers, &s;oon grew weary of this u&s;age; and ra&s;hly, and without a witne&s;s, con|&s;ented to a private marriage with Sir John Bel|mont, a very profligate young man, who had but too &s;ucce&s;sfully found means to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into her favour. He promi&s;ed to conduct her to England&mdash;he did.&mdash;O, Madam, you know the re&s;t!&mdash;Di&s;appointed of the fortune he expect|ed, by the inexorable rancour of the Duvals, he infamou&s;ly burnt the certificate of their marriage, and denied that they had ever been united!</P>
<P>She flew to me for protection. With what mixed tran&s;ports of joy and angui&s;h did I again
<PB N="7" REF="22">
&s;ee her! By my advice &s;he endeavoured to procure proofs of her marriage;&mdash;but in vain: her cre|dulity had been no match for his art.</P>
<P>Every body believed her innocent, from the guiltle&s;s tenor of her un&s;potted youth, and from the known libertini&s;m of her barbarous betrayer. Yet her &s;ufferings were too acute for her tender frame, and the &s;ame moment that gave birth to her infant, put an end at once to the &s;orrows and the life of its mother.</P>
<P>The rage of Madame Duval at her elopement, abated not while this injured victim of cruelty yet drew breath. She probably intended, in time, to have pardoned her, but time was not allowed. When &s;he was informed of her death, I have been told, that the agonies of grief and remor&s;e, with which &s;he was &s;eized, occa&s;ioned her a &s;evere fit of illne&s;s. But, from the time of her recovery to the date of her letter to your Lady&s;hip, I had ne|ver heard that &s;he manife&s;ted any de&s;ire to be made acquainted with the circum&s;tances which attended the death of Lady-Belmont, and the birth of her helple&s;s child.</P>
<P>That child, Madam, &s;hall never, while life is lent me, know the lo&s;s &s;he has &s;u&s;tained. I have cheri&s;hed, &s;uccoured, and &s;upported her, from her earlie&s;t infancy to her &s;ixteenth year; and &s;o amply has &s;he repaid my care and affection, that my fonde&s;t wi&s;h is now bounded in the de&s;ire of be&s;towing her on one who may be &s;en&s;ible of her worth, and then &s;inking to eternal re&s;t in her arms.</P>
<P>Thus it has happened that the education of the father, daughter, and grand-daughter has devolved on me. What infinite mi&s;ery have the two fir&s;t cau&s;ed me! Should the fate of the dear &s;urvivor be
<PB N="8" REF="23">
equally adver&s;e, how wretched will be the end of my cares&mdash;the end of my days!</P>
<P>Even had Madame Duval merited the charge &s;he claims, I fear my fortitude would have been unequal to &s;uch a parting; but, being &s;uch as &s;he is, not only my affection, but my humanity re|coils, at the barbarous idea of de&s;erting the &s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me. Indeed, I could but ill &s;up|port her former yearly vi&s;its to the re&s;pectable man&s;ion at Howard Grove; pardon me, dear Ma|dam, and do not think me in&s;en&s;ible of the honour which your Lady&s;hip's conde&s;cen&s;ion confers upon us both; but &s;o deep is the impre&s;&s;ion which the misfortunes of her mother have made on my heart, that &s;he does not, even for a moment, quit my &s;ight, without exciting apprehen&s;ions and terrors which almo&s;t overpower me. Such, Madam, is my ten|derne&s;s, and &s;uch my weakne&s;s! But &s;he is the only tie I have upon earth, and I tru&s;t to your Lady&s;hip's goodne&s;s not to judge of my feelings with &s;everity.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear and Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t letter gave me infinite plea&s;ure: after &s;o long and tedious an illne&s;s, how grateful to your&s;elf and to your friends mu&s;t be your return|ing health! You have the hearty wi&s;hes of every individual of this place for its continuance and in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>Will you not think I talk advantage of your ac|knowledged recovery, if I once more venture to mention your pupil and Howard Grove together? Yet you mu&s;t remember the patience with which we &s;ubmitted to your de&s;ire of not parting with her during the bad &s;tate of your health, though it was with much reluctance we forbore to &s;olicit her company. My grand-daughter, in particular, has &s;carce been able to repre&s;s her eagerne&s;s to again meet the friend of her infancy; and for my own part, it is very &s;trongly my wi&s;h to manife&s;t the regard which I had for the unfortunate Lady Bel|mont, by proving &s;erviceable to her child; which &s;eems to me the be&s;t re&s;pect that can be paid to her memory. Permit me, therefore, to lay before you a plan which Mrs. Mirvan and I have formed, in con&s;equence of your re&s;toration to health.</P>
<P>I would not frighten you;&mdash;but do you think you could bear to part with your young companion for two or three months? Mrs. Mirvan propo&s;es to
<PB N="10" REF="25">
&s;pend the en&s;uing &s;pring in London, whither, for the fir&s;t time, my grandchild will accompany her: Now, my good friend, it is very earne&s;tly their wi&s;h to enlarge and enliven their party by the ad|dition of your amiable ward, who would &s;hare, equally with her own daughter, the care and at|tention of Mrs. Mirvan. Do not &s;tart at this pro|po&s;al; it is time that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee &s;omething of the world. When young people are too rigidly &s;eque&s;tered from it, their lively and romantic ima|ginations paint it to them as a paradi&s;e of which they have been beguiled; but when they are &s;hown it properly, and in due time, they &s;ee it &s;uch as it really is, equally &s;hared by pain and plea&s;ure, hope and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>You have nothing to apprehend from her meet|ing with Sir John Belmont, as that abandoned man is now abroad, and not expected home this year.</P>
<P>Well, my good Sir, what &s;ay you to our &s;cheme? I hope it will meet with your approbation; but if it &s;hould not, be a&s;&s;ured I can never be di&s;|plea&s;ed at any deci&s;ion made by one who is &s;o much re&s;pected and e&s;teemed as your&s;elf by,</P>

<P>I AM grieved, Madam, to appear ob&s;tinate, and I blu&s;h to incur the imputation of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. In detaining my young charge thus long with my&s;elf in the country, I con&s;ulted not &s;olely my own in|clination. De&s;tined, in all probability, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a very moderate fortune, I wi&s;hed to contract her views to &s;omething within it. The mind is but too naturally prone to plea&s;ure, but too ea&s;ily yield|ed to di&s;&s;ipation: it has been my &s;tudy to guard her again&s;t their delu&s;ions, by preparing her to ex|pect,&mdash;and to de&s;pi&s;e them. But the time draws on for experience and ob&s;ervation to take place of in&s;truc|tion: if I have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, rendered her capable of u&s;ing the one with di&s;cretion, and mak|ing the other with improvement, I &s;hall rejoice my&s;elf with the a&s;&s;urance of having largely con|tributed to her welfare. She is now of an age that happine&s;s is eager to attend,&mdash;let her then enjoy it! I commit her to the protection of your Lady|&s;hip, and only hope &s;he may be found worthy half the goodne&s;s I am &s;atisfied &s;he will meet with at your ho&s;pitable man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus far, Madam, I chearfully &s;ubmit to your de&s;ire. In confiding my ward to the care of Lady Howard, I can feel no unea&s;ine&s;s from her ab&s;ence, but what will ari&s;e from the lo&s;s of her company, &s;ince I &s;hall be as well convinced of her &s;afety, as if &s;he were under my own roof;&mdash;but, can your Lady&s;hip be &s;erious in propo&s;ing to introduce her to the gaieties of a London life? Permit me to
<PB N="12" REF="27">
a&s;k, for what end, or what purpo&s;e? A youthful mind is &s;eldom totally free from ambition; to curb that, is the fir&s;t &s;tep to contentment, &s;ince to di|mini&s;h expectation, is to increa&s;e enjoyment. I apprehend nothing more than too much rai&s;ing her hopes and her views, which the natural vivacity of her di&s;po&s;ition would render but too ea&s;y to effect. The town acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan are all in the circle of high life; this artle&s;s young creature, with too much beauty to e&s;cape notice, has too much &s;en&s;ibility to be indifferent to it; but &s;he has too little wealth to be &s;ought with propriety by men of the fa&s;hionable world.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Madam, the peculiar cruelty of her &s;ituation; only child of a wealthy baronet, who&s;e per&s;on &s;he has never &s;een, who&s;e character &s;he has rea&s;on to abhor, and who&s;e name &s;he is forbidden to claim; entitled as &s;he is to lawfully inherit his fortune and e&s;tate, is there any probability that he will <HI>properly</HI> own her? And while he continues to per&s;evere in di&s;avowing his marriage with Mi&s;s Evelyn, &s;he &s;hall never, at the expence of her mo|ther's honour, receive a part of her right, as the donation of his bounty.</P>
<P>And as to Mr. Evelyn's e&s;tate, I have no doubt but that Madame Duval and her relations will di&s;|po&s;e of it among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, therefore, as if this de&s;erted child, though legally heire&s;s to two large fortunes, mu&s;t owe all her rational expectations to adoption and friend&s;hip. Yet her income will be &s;uch as may make her happy, if &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;o in pri|vate life; though it will by no means allow her to enjoy the luxury of a London fine lady.</P>
<P>Let Mi&s;s Mirvan, then, Madam, &s;hine in all the &s;plendor of high life, but &s;uffer my child &s;till
<PB N="13" REF="28" MS="y">
to enjoy the plea&s;ures of humble retirement, with a mind to which greater views are unknown.</P>
<P>I hope this rea&s;oning will be honoured with your approbation; and I have yet another motive that has &s;ome weight with me; I would not wil|lingly give offence to any human being, and &s;urely Madame Duval might accu&s;e me of inju&s;tice, if, while I refu&s;e to let her grand-daughter wait upon her, I con&s;ent to her joining a party of plea&s;ure to London.</P>
<P>In &s;ending her to Howard Grove, not one of the&s;e &s;cruples ari&s;e; and therefore Mrs. Clinton, a mo&s;t worthy woman, formerly her nur&s;e, and now my hou&s;ekeeper, &s;hall attend her thither next week.</P>
<P>Though I have always called her by the name of Anville, and reported in this neighbourhood that her father, my intimate friend, left her to my guardian&s;hip, yet I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to let her be her&s;elf acquainted with the melancholy circum&s;tances attending her birth; for, though I am very de&s;irous of guarding her from curio&s;ity and impertinence, by concealing her name, fa|mily, and &s;tory, yet I would not leave it in the power of charce, to &s;hock her gentle nature with a tale of &s;o much &s;orrow.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not, Madam, expect too much from my pupil. She is quite a little ru&s;tic, and knows nothing of the world; and though her education has been the be&s;t I could be&s;tow in this retired place, to which Dorche&s;ter, the neare&s;t town, is &s;even miles di&s;tant, yet I &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed if you &s;hould di&s;cover in her a thou&s;and deficiencies of which I have never dreamt. She mu&s;t be very much altered &s;ince &s;he was la&s;t at Howard Grove,&mdash;but I will &s;ay nothing of her; I leave her to your

<SALUTE>Dear and Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;olemn manner in which you have com|mitted your child to my care, has in &s;ome mea|&s;ure dampt the plea&s;ure which I receive from the tru&s;t, as it makes me fear that you &s;uffer from your compliance, in which ca&s;e I &s;hall very &s;in|cerely blame my&s;elf for the earne&s;tne&s;s with which I have reque&s;ted this favour; but remember, my good Sir, &s;he is within a few days &s;ummons, and be a&s;&s;ured I will not detain her a moment longer than you wi&s;h.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire my opinion of her.</P>
<P>She is a little angel! I cannot wonder that you &s;ought to monopolize her. Neither ought you, at finding it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Her face and per&s;on an&s;wer my mo&s;t refined ideas of complete beauty: and this, though a &s;ubject of prai&s;e le&s;s important to you, or to me, than any other, is yet &s;o &s;triking, it is not po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s it unnoticed. Had I not known from whom &s;he received her education, I &s;hould, at fir&s;t &s;ight of &s;o perfect a face, have been in pain for her under&s;tanding; &s;ince it has been long and ju&s;tly remarked, that folly has ever &s;ought alli|ance with beauty.</P>
<P>She has the &s;ame gentlene&s;s in her manners, the &s;ame natural grace in her motions, that I formerly &s;o much admired in her mother. Her character &s;eems truly ingenuous and &s;imple; and, at the
<PB N="16" REF="31">
&s;ame time that nature hus ble&s;&s;ed her with an ex|cellent under&s;tanding, and great quickne&s;s of parts, &s;he has a certain air of inexperience and in|nocency that is extremely intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>You have no rea&s;on to regret the retirement in which &s;he has lived; &s;ince that politene&s;s which is acquired by an acquaintance with high life, is in her &s;o well &s;upplied by a natural de&s;ire of ob|liging, joined to a deportment infinitely engaging.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve with great &s;atisfaction a growing affec|tion between this amiable girl and my grand-daugh|ter, who&s;e heart is as free from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or con|ceit, as that of her young friend is from all guile. Their attachment may be mutually u&s;eful, &s;ince much is to be expected from emulation, where nothing is to be feared from envy. I would have them love each other as &s;i&s;ters, and reciprocally &s;upply the place of that tender and happy relati|on&s;hip to which neither of them have a natural claim.</P>
<P>Be &s;atisfied, my good Sir, that your child &s;hall meet with the &s;ame attention as our own. We all join in mo&s;t hearty wi&s;hes for your health and happine&s;s, and in returning our &s;incere thanks for the favour you have con&s;erred on us.</P>

<P>BE not alarmed, my worthy friend, at my &s;o &s;peedily troubling you again; I &s;eldom u&s;e the ceremony of waiting for an&s;wers, or writing with any regularity, and I have at pre&s;ent immediate occa&s;ion for begging your patience.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan has ju&s;t received a letter from her long-ab&s;ent hu&s;band, containing the welcome news of his hoping to reach London by the be|ginning of next week. My daughter and the Captain have been &s;eparated almo&s;t &s;even years, and it would therefore be needle&s;s to &s;ay what joy, &s;urpri&s;e, and con&s;equently confu&s;ion, his, at pre&s;ent, unexpected return has cau&s;ed at Howard Grove. Mrs. Mirvan, you cannot doubt, will go in&s;tantly to town to meet him; her daughter is under a thou&s;and obligations to attend her; I grieve that her mother cannot.</P>
<P>And now, my good Sir, I almo&s;t blu&s;h to pro|ceed;&mdash;but, tell me, may I a&s;k&mdash;will you permit&mdash;that your child may accompany them? Do not think us unrea&s;onable, but con&s;ider the many in|ducements which con&s;pire to make London the happie&s;t place at pre&s;ent &s;he can be in. The joyful occa&s;ion of the journey; the gaiety of the whole party; oppo&s;ed to the dull life &s;he mu&s;t lead if left here, with a &s;olitary old woman for her &s;ole companion, while &s;he &s;o well knows the chearfulne&s;s and felicity enjoyed by the re&s;t of the family,&mdash;are circum&s;tances that &s;eem to merit
<PB N="18" REF="33">
your con&s;ideration. Mrs. Mirvan de&s;ires me to a&s;&s;ure you, that one week is all &s;he a&s;ks, as &s;he is certain that the Captain, who hates London, will be eager to revi&s;it. Howard Grove: and Maria is &s;o very earne&s;t in wi&s;hing to have the company of her friend, that, if you are inexora|ble, &s;he will be deprived of half the plea&s;ure &s;he otherwi&s;e hopes to receive.</P>
<P>However, I will not, my good Sir, deceive you into an opinion that they intend to live in a retired manner, as that cannot be fairly expected. But you have no rea&s;on to be unea&s;y concerning Madame Duval; &s;he has no corre&s;pondent in England, and only gains intelligence by common report. She mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to the name your child bears; and, even &s;hould &s;he hear of this excur&s;ion, &s;o &s;hort a time as a week, or le&s;s, &s;pent in town upon &s;o particular an occa&s;ion, though previous to their meeting, cannot be con|&s;trued into di&s;re&s;pect to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan de&s;ires me to a&s;&s;ure you, that if you will oblige her, her <HI>two</HI> children &s;hall equally &s;hare her time and her attention. She has &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to a friend in town to take a hou&s;e for her, and while &s;he waits for an an&s;wer con|cerning it, I &s;hall for one from you to our pe|tition. However, your child is writing her&s;elf, and that, I doubt not, will more avail than all we can po&s;&s;ibly urge.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Queen-Ann-Street, London, <DATE>Saturday, April 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS moment arrived. Ju&s;t going to Drury-Lane Theatre. The celebrated Mr. Garrick per|forms Ranger. I am quite in extacy. So is Mi&s;s Mirvan. How fortunate, that he &s;hould happen to play! We would not let Mrs. Mirvan re&s;t till &s;he con&s;ented to go; her chief objection was to our dre&s;s, for we have had no time to <HI>Londonize</HI> our|&s;elves; but we teized her into compliance, and &s;o we are to &s;it in &s;ome ob&s;cure place, that &s;he may not be &s;een. As to me, I &s;hould be alike unknown in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous or mo&s;t private part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I can write no more now. I have hardly time to breathe&mdash;only ju&s;t this, the hou&s;es and &s;treets are not quite &s;o &s;uperb as I expected. However, I have &s;een nothing yet, &s;o I ought not to judge.</P>
<P>Well, adieu, my deare&s;t Sir, for the pre&s;ent; I could not forbear writing a few words in&s;tantly on my arrival; though I &s;uppo&s;e my letter of thanks for your con&s;ent is &s;till on the road.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="38">
Saturday Night.</P>
<P>O my dear Sir, in what raptures am I returned! Well may Mr. Garrick be &s;o celebrated, &s;o univer|&s;ally admired&mdash;I had not any idea of &s;o great a performer.</P>
<P>Such ea&s;e! &s;uch vivacity in his manner! &s;uch grace in his motions! &s;uch fire and meaning in his eyes!&mdash;I could hardly believe he had &s;tudied a written part, for every word &s;eemed &s;poke from the impul&s;e of the moment.</P>
<P>His action&mdash;at once &s;o graceful and &s;o free!&mdash;his voice&mdash;&s;o clear, &s;o melodious, yet &s;o wonder|fully various in its tones&mdash;&s;uch animation!&mdash;every look <HI>&s;peaks!</HI></P>
<P>I would have given the world to have had the whole play acted over again. And when he danced&mdash;O how I envied Clarinda! I almo&s;t wi&s;hed to have jumped on the &s;tage and joined them.</P>
<P>I am afraid you will think me mad, &s;o I won't &s;ay any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could &s;ee him. I intend to a&s;k Mrs. Mirvan to go to the play every night while we &s;tay in town. She is extremely kind to me, and Maria, her charming daughter, is the &s;weete&s;t girl in the world.</P>
<P>I &s;hall write to you every evening all that pa&s;&s;es in the day, and that in the &s;ame manner as, if I could &s;ee, I &s;hould tell you.</P>
<P>Sunday.</P>
<P>This morning we went to Portland chapel, and afterwards we walked in the Mall in St. James's Park, which by no means an&s;wered my expectati|ons: it is a long &s;traight walk, of dirty gravel, ve|ry unea&s;y to the feet; and at each end, in&s;tead of an open pro&s;pect, nothing is to be &s;een but hou&s;es
<PB N="24" REF="39">
built of brick. When Mrs. Mirvan pointed out the <HI>Palace</HI> to me&mdash;I think I was never much more &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>However the walk was very agreeable to us; every body looked gay, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed, and the ladies were &s;o much dre&s;&s;ed, that Mi&s;s Mirvan and I could do nothing but look at them. Mrs. Mirvan met &s;everal of her friends. No wonder, for I never &s;aw &s;o many people a&s;&s;embled together before. I looked about for &s;ome of <HI>my</HI> acquaint|ance, but in vain, for I &s;aw not one per&s;on that I knew, which is very odd, for all the world &s;eemed there.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan &s;ays we are not to walk in the Park again next Sunday, even if we &s;hould be in town, becau&s;e there is better company in Ken&s;ing|ton Gardens. But really if you had &s;een how much every body was dre&s;&s;ed, you would not think that po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We are to go this evening to a private ball, gi|ven by Mrs. Stanley, a very fa&s;hionable lady of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance.</P>
<P>We have been a <HI>&s;hopping,</HI> as Mrs. Mirvan calls it, all this morning, to buy &s;ilks, caps, gauzes, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>The &s;hops are really very entertaining, e&s;pecially the mercers; there &s;eem to be &s;ix or &s;even men be|longing to each &s;hop, and every one took care, by bowing and &s;mirking, to be noticed; we were con|ducted from one to another, and carried from room to room, with &s;o much ceremony, that at fir&s;t I was almo&s;t afraid to follow.</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould never have cho&s;en a &s;ilk, for they produced &s;o many, I knew not which to fix upon, and they recommended them all &s;o &s;trongly that I fancy they thought I only wanted per&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="25" REF="40">
to buy every thing they &s;hewed me. And, indeed, they took &s;o much trouble, that I was almo&s;t a&s;ha|med I could not.</P>
<P>At the milliners, the ladies we met were &s;o much dre&s;&s;ed, that I &s;hould rather have imagined they were making vi&s;its than purcha&s;es. But what mo&s;t diverted me was, that we were more frequently &s;erved by men than by women; and &s;uch men! &s;o finical, &s;o affected! they &s;eemed to under&s;tand eve|ry part of a woman's dre&s;s better than we do our|&s;elves; and they recommended caps and ribbands with an air of &s;o much importance, that I wi&s;hed to a&s;k them how long they had left off wearing them!</P>
<P>The di&s;patch with which they work in the&s;e great &s;hops is amazing, for they have promi&s;ed me a com|pleat &s;uit of linen again&s;t the evening.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t had my hair dre&s;&s;ed. You can't think how oddly my head feels; full of powder and black pins, and a great <HI>cu&s;hion</HI> on the top of it. I believe you would hardly know me, for my face looks quite different from what it did before my hair was dre&s;&s;ed. When I &s;hall be able to make u&s;e of a comb for my&s;elf I cannot tell, for my hair is &s;o much entangled, <HI>frizzled</HI> they call it, that I fear it will be very difficult.</P>
<P>I am half afraid of this ball to-night, for, you know, I have never danced but at &s;chool; however, Mi&s;s Mirvan &s;ays there is nothing in it. Yet I wi&s;h it was over.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir; pray excu&s;e the wretched &s;tuff I write, perhaps I may improve by being in this town, and then my letters will be le&s;s unwor|thy your reading. Mean time I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Queen-Anne-Street, <DATE>April 5, Tue&s;day morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE a va&s;t deal to &s;ay, and &s;hall give all this morning to my pen. As to my plan of writ|ing every evening the adventures of the day, I find it impracticable; for the diver&s;ions here are &s;o very late, that if I begin my letters after them, I could not go to bed at all.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t a mo&s;t extraordinary evening. A <HI>pri|vate</HI> ball this was called, &s;o I expected to have &s;een about four or five couple; but, Lord, my dear Sir, I believe I &s;aw half the world! Two very large rooms were full of company; in one, were cards for the elderly ladies, and in the other, were the dancers. My mamma Mirvan, for &s;he always calls me her child, &s;aid &s;he would &s;it with Ma|ria and me till we were provided with partners, and then join the card players.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, as they pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed, looked as if they thought we were quite at their di&s;po&s;al, and only waiting for the honour of their commands; and they &s;auntered about in a carele&s;s indolent manner, as if with a view to keep us in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. I don't &s;peak of this in regard to Mi&s;s Mirvan and my&s;elf only, but to the ladies in ge|neral; and I thought it &s;o provoking, that I de|termined, in my own mind, that, far from humour|ing
<PB N="27" REF="42">
&s;uch airs, I would rather not dance at all, than with any one who &s;hould &s;eem to think me ready to accept the fir&s;t partner who would con|de&s;cend to take me.</P>
<P>Not long after, a young man, who had for &s;ome time looked at us with a kind of negligent imper|tinence, advanced, on tiptoe, towards me; he had a &s;et &s;mile on his face, and his dre&s;s was &s;o fop|pi&s;h, that I really believe he even wi&s;hed to be &s;tared at; and yet he was very ugly.</P>
<P>Bowing almo&s;t to the ground, with a &s;ort of &s;wing, and waving his hand with the greate&s;t con|ceit, after a &s;hort and &s;illy pau&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ma|dam&mdash;may I pre&s;ume?"&mdash;</Q>and &s;topt, offering to take my hand, I drew it back, but could &s;carce forbear laughing. <Q REND="inline">"Allow me, Madam,"</Q> (con|tinued he, affectedly breaking off every half mo|ment) <Q REND="inline">"the honour and happine&s;s&mdash;if I am not &s;o unhappy as to addre&s;s you too late&mdash;to have the happine&s;s and honour&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Again he would have taken my hand, but, bow|ing my head, I begged to be excu&s;ed, and turned to Mi&s;s Mirvan to conceal my laughter. He then de&s;ired to know if I had already engaged my&s;elf to &s;ome more fortunate man? I &s;aid No, and that I believed I &s;hould not dance at all. He would keep him&s;elf, he told me, di&s;engaged, in hopes I &s;hould relent; and then, uttering &s;ome ridiculous &s;peeches of &s;orrow and di&s;appointment, though his face &s;till wore the &s;ame invariable &s;mile, he re|treated.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, as we have &s;ince recollected, that during this little dialogue, Mrs. Mirvan was con|ver&s;ing with the lady of the hou&s;e. And very &s;oon after another gentleman, who &s;eemed about &s;ix|and-twenty years old, gayly, but not &s;oppi&s;hly,
<PB N="28" REF="43">
dre&s;&s;ed, and indeed extremely hand&s;ome, with an air of mixed politene&s;s and gallantry, de&s;ired to know if I was engaged, or would honour him with my hand. So he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, though I am &s;ure I know not what honour he could re|ceive from me; but the&s;e &s;ort of expre&s;&s;ions, I find, are u&s;ed as words of cour&s;e, without any di&s;|tinction of per&s;ons, or &s;tudy of propriety.</P>
<P>Well, I bowed, and I am &s;ure I coloured; for indeed I was frightened at the thoughts of dancing before &s;o many people, all &s;trangers, and, which was wor&s;e, <HI>with</HI> a &s;tranger; however, that was unavoidable, for though I looked round the room &s;everal times, I could not &s;ee one per&s;on that I knew. And &s;o, he took my hand, and led me to join in the dance.</P>
<P>The minuets were over before we arrived, for we were kept late by the milliner's making us wait for our things.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed very de&s;irous of entering into con|ver&s;ation with me; but I was &s;eized with &s;uch a panic, that I could hardly &s;peak a word, and no|thing but the &s;hame of &s;o &s;oon changing my mind, prevented my returning to my &s;eat, and declining to dance at all.</P>
<P>He appeared to be &s;urpri&s;ed at my terror, which I believe was but too apparent: however, he a&s;ked no que&s;tions, though I fear he mu&s;t think it very odd; for I did not choo&s;e to tell him it was owing to my never before dancing but with a &s;chool|girl.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation was &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited; his air and addre&s;s were open and noble; his manners gentle, attentive, and infinitely engaging; his per|&s;on is all elegance, and his countenance the mo&s;t animated and expre&s;&s;ive I have ever &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="44">
In a &s;hort time we were joined by Mi&s;s Mirvan, who &s;tood next couple to us. But how was I &s;tartled, when &s;he whi&s;pered me that my partner was a nobleman! This gave me a new alarm; how will he be provoked, thought I, when he finds what a &s;imple ru&s;tic he has honoured with his choice! one who&s;e ignorance of the world makes her perpetually fear doing &s;omething wrong!</P>
<P>That he &s;hould be &s;o much my &s;uperior every way, quite di&s;concerted me; and you will &s;uppo&s;e my &s;pirits were not much rai&s;ed, when I heard a lady in pa&s;&s;ing us, &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"This is the mo&s;t difficult dance I ever &s;aw."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear, then,"</Q> cried Maria to her partner, <Q REND="inline">"with your leave, I'll &s;it down till the next."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So will I too, then,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"for I am &s;ure I can hardly &s;tand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you mu&s;t &s;peak to your partner fir&s;t,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; for he had turned a&s;ide to talk with &s;ome gentlemen. However, I had not &s;ufficient courage to addre&s;s him, and &s;o away we all three tript, and &s;eated our&s;elves at another end of the room.</P>
<P>But, unfortunately for me, Mi&s;s Mirvan &s;oon after &s;uffered her&s;elf to be prevailed upon to at|tempt the dance; and ju&s;t as &s;he ro&s;e to go, &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"My dear, yonder is your partner, Lord Orville, walking about the room in &s;earch of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't leave me, then, dear girl!"</Q> cried I; but &s;he was obliged to go. And then I was more unea&s;y than ever; I would have given the world to have &s;een Mrs. Mirvan, and begged of her to make my apologies; for what, thought I, can I po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay for my&s;elf in excu&s;e for running away? he mu&s;t either conclude me a fool, or half mad, for any one brought up in the great world, and
<PB N="30" REF="45">
accu&s;tomed to its ways, can have no idea of &s;uch &s;ort of fears as mine.</P>
<P>I was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, when I ob&s;erved that he was every where &s;eeking me, with apparent perplexity and &s;urpri&s;e; but when, at la&s;t, I &s;aw him move towards the place where I &s;at, I was ready to &s;ink with &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s. I found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to keep my &s;eat, becau&s;e I could not think of a word to &s;ay for my&s;elf, and &s;o I ro&s;e, and walked ha&s;tily towards the card-room, re&s;olving to &s;tay with Mrs. Mirvan the re&s;t of the evening, and not to dance at all. But before I could find her, Lord Orville &s;aw and approached me.</P>
<P>He begged to know if I was not well? You may ea&s;ily imagine how much I was confu&s;ed. I made no an&s;wer, but hung my head, like a fool, and looked on my fan.</P>
<P>He then, with an air the mo&s;t re&s;pectfully &s;e|rious, a&s;ked if he had been &s;o unhappy as to of|fend me?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed!"</Q> cried I: and then, in hopes of changing the di&s;cour&s;e, and preventing his further inquiries, I de&s;ired to know if he had &s;een the young lady who had been conver&s;ing with me?</P>
<P>No;&mdash;but would I honour him with my com|mands to &s;ee for her?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O by no means!"</Q></P>
<P>Was there any other per&s;on with whom I wi&s;hed to &s;peak?</P>
<P>I &s;aid <HI>no,</HI> before I knew I had an&s;wered at all.</P>
<P>Should he have the plea&s;ure of bringing me any refre&s;hment?</P>
<P>I bowed, almo&s;t involuntarily. And away he flew.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="46">
I was quite a&s;hamed at being &s;o trouble&s;ome, and &s;o much <HI>above</HI> my&s;elf as the&s;e &s;eeming airs made me appear; but indeed I was too much confu&s;ed to think or act with any con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>If he had not been &s;wift as lightning, I don't know whether I &s;hould not have &s;tolen away again; but he returned in a moment. When I had drank a gla&s;s of lemonade, he hoped, he &s;aid, that I would again honour him with my hand, as a new dance was ju&s;t begun. I had not the pre&s;ence of mind to &s;ay a &s;ingle word, and &s;o I let him once more lead me to the place I had left.</P>
<P>Shocked to find how &s;illy, how childi&s;h a part I had acted, my former fears of dancing before &s;uch a company, and with &s;uch a partner, returned more forcibly than ever. I &s;uppo&s;e he perceived my unea&s;ine&s;s, for he intreated me to &s;it down again, if dancing was di&s;agreeable to me. But I was quite &s;atisfied with the folly I had already &s;hewn, and therefore declined his offer, though I was really &s;carce able to &s;tand.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch con&s;cious di&s;advantages, you may ea&s;ily imagine, my dear Sir, how ill I acquitted my&s;elf. But, though I both expected and de|&s;erved to find him very much mortified and di&s;|plea&s;ed at his ill fortune in the choice he had made, yet, to my very great relief, he appeared to be even contented, and very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted and en|couraged me. The&s;e people in high life have too much pre&s;ence of mind, I believe, to <HI>&s;eem</HI> di&s;con|certed, or out of humour, however they may feel; for had I been the per&s;on of the mo&s;t con&s;equence in the room, I could not have met with more at|tention and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When the dance was over, &s;eeing me &s;till very much &s;lurried, he led me to a &s;eat, &s;aying that he
<PB N="32" REF="47">
would not &s;uffer me to fatigue my&s;elf from po|litene&s;s.</P>
<P>And then, if my capacity, or even if my &s;pirits had been better, in how animated a conver+&s;ation might I have been engaged! It was then that I &s;aw the rank of Lord Orville was his lea&s;t recommendation, his under&s;tanding and his man|ners being far more di&s;tingui&s;hed. His remarks upon the company in general were &s;o apt, &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o lively, I am almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed my&s;elf that they did not re-animate me; but indeed I was too well convinced of the ridiculous part I had my&s;elf played before &s;o nice an ob&s;erver, to be able to enjoy his plea&s;antry: &s;o &s;elf-compa&s;&s;ion gave me feeling for others. Yet I had not the courage to attempt either to defend them, or to rally in my turn, but li&s;tened to him in &s;ilent embarra&s;&s;|ment.</P>
<P>When he found this, he changed the &s;ubject, and talked of public places, and public performers; but he &s;oon di&s;covered that I was totally igno|rant of them.</P>
<P>He then, very ingeniou&s;ly, turned the di&s;|cour&s;e to the amu&s;ements and occupations of the country.</P>
<P>It now &s;truck me, that he was re&s;olved to try whether or not I was capable of talking upon <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject. This put &s;o great a con&s;traint upon my thoughts, that I was unable to go further than a mono&s;yllable, and not even &s;o far, when I could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it.</P>
<P>We were &s;itting in this manner, he conver&s;ing with all gaiety, I looking down with all fooli&s;h|ne&s;s, when that fop who had fir&s;t a&s;ked me to dance, with a mo&s;t ridiculous &s;olemnity, approach|ed, and after a profound bow or two, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="33" REF="48">
humbly beg pardon, Madam,&mdash;and of you too, my Lord,&mdash;for breaking in upon &s;uch agreeable conver&s;ation&mdash;which mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, be much more delectable&mdash;than what I have the honour to offer&mdash;but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>I interrupted him&mdash;I blu&s;h for my folly,&mdash;with laughing; yet I could not help it, for, added to the man's &s;tately foppi&s;hne&s;s, (and he actually took &s;nuff between every three words) when I looked round at Lord Orville, I &s;aw &s;uch ex|treme &s;urpri&s;e in his face,&mdash;the cau&s;e of which appeared &s;o ab&s;urd, that I could not for my life pre&s;erve my gravity.</P>
<P>I had not laughed before from the time I had left Mi&s;s Mirvan, and I had much better have cried then; Lord Orville actually &s;tared at me; the beau, I know not his name, looked quite enraged. <Q REND="inline">"Refrain&mdash;Madam,"</Q> (&s;aid he, with an important air,) <Q REND="inline">"a few moments refrain!&mdash;I have but a &s;entence to trouble you with.&mdash;May I know to what accident I mu&s;t attribute not having the honour of your hand?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Accident, Sir!"</Q> repeated I, much a&s;to|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, accident, Madam&mdash;for &s;urely,&mdash;I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve&mdash;pardon me, Madam, it ought to be no common one&mdash;that &s;hould tempt a lady&mdash;&s;o young a one too,&mdash;to be guilty of ill manners."</Q></P>
<P>A confu&s;ed idea now for the fir&s;t time entered my head, &s;omething I had heard of the rules of a&s;&s;emblies; but I was never at one before,&mdash;I have only danced at &s;chool,&mdash;and &s;o giddy and heedle&s;s I was, that I had not once con&s;idered the impropriety of refu&s;ing one partner, and after|wards accepting another. I was thunder&s;truck at
<PB N="34" REF="49">
the recollection: but, while the&s;e thoughts were ru&s;hing into my head, Lord Orville, with &s;ome warmth, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This lady, Sir, is incapable of meriting &s;uch an accu&s;ation!"</Q></P>
<P>The creature&mdash;for I am very angry with him,&mdash;made a low bow, and with a grin the mo&s;t malicious I ever &s;aw, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, &s;aid he, far be it from me to <HI>accu&s;e</HI> the lady, for having the di&s;cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h and prefer&mdash;the &s;uperior attractions of your Lord&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P>Again he bowed, and walked off.</P>
<P>Was ever any thing &s;o provoking? I was ready to die with &s;hame. <Q REND="inline">"What a coxcomb!"</Q> ex|claimed Lord Orville; while I, without know|ing what I did, ro&s;e ha&s;tily, and moving off, <Q REND="inline">"I can't imagine, cried I, where Mrs. Mirvan has hid her&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give me leave to &s;ee,"</Q> an&s;wered he. I bowed and &s;at down again, not daring to meet his eyes; for what mu&s;t he think of me, between my blunder and the &s;uppo&s;ed preference?</P>
<P>He returned in a moment, and told me that Mrs. Mirvan was at cards, but would be glad to &s;ee me; and I went immediately. There was but one chair vacant, &s;o, to my great relief, Lord Orville pre&s;ently left us. I then told Mrs. Mirvan my di&s;a&s;ters, and &s;he good-naturedly blamed her|&s;elf for not having better in&s;tructed me, but &s;aid &s;he had taken it for granted that I mu&s;t know &s;uch common cu&s;toms. However, the man may, I think, be &s;atisfied with his pretty &s;peech, and carry his re&s;entment no farther.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, Lord Orville returned. I con|&s;ented, with the be&s;t grace I could, to go down another dance, for I had had time to recollect my&s;elf, and therefore re&s;olved to u&s;e &s;ome exer|tion,
<PB N="35" REF="50">
and, if po&s;&s;ible, appear le&s;s a fool than I hitherto had: for it occurred to me that, in&s;igni|ficant as I was, compared to a man of his rank and figure, yet, &s;ince he had been &s;o unfortunate as to make choice of me for a partner, why I &s;hould endeavour to make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The dance, however, was &s;hort, and he &s;poke very little; &s;o I had no opportunity of putting my re|&s;olution in practice. He was &s;atisfied, I &s;uppo&s;e, with his former &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s efforts to draw me out: or, rather, I fancied, he has been inquiring <HI>who I was.</HI> This again di&s;concerted me, and the &s;pi|rits I had determined to exert, again failed me. Tired, a&s;hamed, and mortified, I begged to &s;it down till we returned home, which we did &s;oon after. Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me to the coach, talking all the way of the honour <HI>I</HI> had done <HI>him!</HI> O the&s;e fa&s;hionable people!</P>
<P>Well, my dear Sir, was it not a &s;trange even|ing? I could not help being thus particular, be|cau&s;e, to me, every thing is &s;o new. But it is now time to conclude. I am, with all love and duty,</P>

<P>THERE is to be no end to the troubles of la&s;t night. I have, this moment, between per&s;ua&s;ion and laughter, gathered from Maria the mo&s;t curi|ous dialogue that ever I heard. You will, at fir&s;t, be &s;tartled at my vanity; but, my dear Sir, have patience!</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed while I was &s;itting with Mrs. Mirvan in the card-room. Maria was taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, and &s;aw Lord Orville advanc|ing for the &s;ame purpo&s;e him&s;elf; but he did not know her, though &s;he immediately recollected him. Pre&s;ently after, a very gay-looking man, &s;tepping ha&s;tily up to him, cried, <Q REND="inline">"Why, my Lord, what have you done with your lovely partner!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Nothing!</HI>"</Q> an&s;wered Lord Orville, with a &s;mile and a &s;hrug.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By Jove, cried the man, &s;he is the mo&s;t beau|tiful creature I ever &s;aw in my life!"</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville, as he well might, laughed, but an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, a pretty mode&s;t-looking girl."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my Lord!"</Q> cried the madman, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is an angel!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A <HI>&s;ilent</HI> one,"</Q> returned he.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why ay, my Lord, how &s;tands &s;he as to that? She looks all intelligence and expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A poor weak girl!"</Q> an&s;wered Lord Orville, &s;haking his head.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="52">
<Q REND="inline">"By Jove,"</Q> cried the other, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad to hear it!"</Q></P>
<P>At that moment, the &s;ame odious creature who had been my former torment, joined them. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing Lord Orville with great re&s;pect, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon, my Lord,&mdash;if I was&mdash;as I fear might be the ca&s;e&mdash;rather too &s;evere in my cen|&s;ure of the lady who is honoured with your pro|tection&mdash;but, my Lord, ill breeding is apt to pro|voke a man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ill-breeding!"</Q> cried my unknown champion, <Q REND="inline">"impo&s;&s;ible! that elegant face can never be &s;o vile a ma&s;k!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir, as to that,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t allow <HI>me</HI> to judge; for though I pay all deference to your opinion&mdash;in other things,&mdash;yet I hope you will grant&mdash;and I appeal to your Lord&s;hip al&s;o&mdash;that I am not totally de&s;picable as a judge of good or ill manners."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was &s;o wholly ignorant,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville gravely, <Q REND="inline">"of the provocation you might have had, that I could not but be &s;urpri&s;ed at your &s;ingular re&s;entment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was far from my intention, an&s;wered he, to offend your Lord&s;hip; but really, for a per|&s;on who is nobody, to give her&s;elf &s;uch airs,&mdash;I own I could not command my pa&s;&s;ions. For, my Lord, though I have made diligent enquiry&mdash;I cannot learn who &s;he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By what I can make out,"</Q> cried my defender, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he mu&s;t be a country par&s;on's daughter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He! he! he! very good, 'pon honour!"</Q> cried the fop,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"well, &s;o I could have &s;worn by her manners."</Q></P>
<P>And then, delighted at his own wit, he laughed, and went away, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to repeat it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53">
<Q REND="inline">"But what the deuce is all this?</Q> demanded the other.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why a very fooli&s;h affair,"</Q> an&s;wered Lord Orville; <Q REND="inline">"your Helen fir&s;t refu&s;ed this coxcomb, and then&mdash;danced with me. This is all I can ga|ther of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Orville,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"you are a happy man!&mdash;But, <HI>ill-bred?</HI>&mdash;I can never believe it? And &s;he looks too &s;en&s;ible to be <HI>ignorant.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whether ignorant or mi&s;chievous, I will not pretend to determine, but certain it is, &s;he attended to all <HI>I</HI> could &s;ay to her, though I have really fatigued my&s;elf with fruitle&s;s endeavours to enter|tain her, with the mo&s;t immoveable gravity; but no &s;ooner did Lovel begin his complaint, than &s;he was &s;eized with a fit of Laughing, fir&s;t af|fronting the poor beau, and then enjoying his mor|tification."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha! ha! ha! why there's &s;ome <HI>genius</HI> in that, my Lord, though perhaps rather <HI>ru&s;tick.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Here Maria was called to dance, and &s;o heard no more.</P>
<P>Now tell me, my dear Sir, did you ever know any thing more provoking? <Q REND="inline">"<HI>A poor weak girl!</HI>" "<HI>ignorant or mi&s;chievous!</HI>"</Q> What mortifying words! I'm re&s;olved, however, that I will never again be tempted to go to an a&s;&s;embly. I wi&s;h I had been in Dor&s;et&s;hire.</P>
<P>Well, after this, you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed that Lord Orville contented him&s;elf with an enquiry after our healths this morning, by his &s;ervant, without troubling him&s;elf to call; as Mi&s;s Mirvan had told me he would: but perhaps it may be only a country cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>I would not live here for the world. I don't care how &s;oon we leave town. London &s;oon

<P>Well, my dear Sir, I have been plea&s;ed, again&s;t my will, I could almo&s;t &s;ay, for I mu&s;t own I went out in very ill-humour, which I think you can't wonder at: but the mu&s;ic and the &s;inging were charming; they &s;oothed me into a plea&s;ure the mo&s;t grateful, the be&s;t &s;uited to my pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition in the world. I hope to per&s;uade Mrs. Mirvan to go again on Saturday. I wi&s;h the opera was every night. It is, of all entertain|ments, the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t delightful. Some of the &s;ongs &s;eemed to melt my very &s;oul. It was what they call a <HI>&s;erious</HI> opera, as the <HI>comic</HI> fir&s;t &s;inger was ill.</P>
<P>To-night we go to Ranelagh. If any of tho&s;e three gentlemen who conver&s;ed &s;o freely about me &s;hould be there&mdash;but I won't think of it.</P>

<P>Well, my dear Sir, we went to Ranelagh. It is a charming place, and the brilliancy of the lights, on my fir&s;t entrance, made me almo&s;t think I was in &s;ome inchanted ca&s;tle, or fairy palace, for all looked like magic to me.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t per&s;on I &s;aw was Lord Orville. I felt &s;o confu&s;ed!&mdash;but he did not &s;ee me. After tea, Mrs. Mirvan being tired, Maria and I walked round the room alone. Then again we &s;aw him, &s;tanding by the orche&s;tra. We, too, &s;topt to hear a &s;inger. He bowed to me; I court&s;ied, and I am &s;ure I coloured. We &s;oon
<PB N="40" REF="55">
walked on, not liking our &s;ituation; however, he did not follow us, and when we pa&s;t by the orche&s;tra again, he was gone. Afterwards, in the cour&s;e of the evening, we met him &s;everal times, but he was always with &s;ome party, and never &s;poke to us, tho' whenever he chanced to meet my eyes, he conde&s;cended to bow.</P>
<P>I cannot but be hurt at the opinion he enter|tains of me. It is true, my own behaviour in|curred it&mdash;yet is him&s;elf the mo&s;t agreeable, and, &s;eemingly, the mo&s;t amiable man in the world, and therefore it is, that I am grieved to be thought ill of by him: for of who&s;e e&s;teem ought we to be ambitious, if not of tho&s;e who mo&s;t merit our own?&mdash;But it is too late to reflect upon this now. Well, I can't help it;&mdash;How|ever, I think I have done with a&s;&s;emblies!</P>
<P>This morning was de&s;tined for <HI>&s;eeing &s;ights,</HI> auc|tions, curious &s;hops, and &s;o forth; but my head ached, and I was not in a humour to be amu&s;ed, and &s;o I made them go without me, though very unwillingly. They are all kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>And now I am &s;orry I did not accompany them, for I know not what to do with my&s;elf. I had re|&s;olved not to go to the play to-night; but I believe I &s;hall. In &s;hort, I hardly care whether I do or not.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I thought I had done wrong! Mrs. Mirvan and Maria have been half the town over, and &s;o en|tertained!&mdash;while I, like a fool, &s;tayed at home to do nothing. And, at an auction in Pall-Mall, who &s;hould they meet but Lord Orville! He &s;at next to Mrs Mirvan, and they talked a great deal
<PB N="41" REF="56">
together: but &s;he gave me no account of the con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I may never have &s;uch another opportunity of &s;eeing London; I am quite &s;orry that I was not of the party; but I de&s;erve this mortification, for having indulged my ill-humour.</P>

<P>Captain Mirvan is arrived. I have not &s;pirits to give an account of his introduction, for he has really &s;hocked me. I do not like him. He &s;eems to be &s;urly, vulgar, and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the &s;ame moment that Maria was pre|&s;ented to him, he began &s;ome rude je&s;ts upon the bad &s;hape of her no&s;e, and called her a tall, ill|formed thing. She bore it with the utmo&s;t good|humour; but that kind and &s;weet-tempered wo|man, Mrs. Mirvan, de&s;erved a better lot. I am amazed &s;he would marry him.</P>
<P>For my own part, I have been &s;o &s;hy, that I have hardly &s;poken to him, or he to me. I can|not imagine why the family was &s;o rejoiced at his return. If he had &s;pent his whole life abroad, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed they might rather have been thankful than &s;orrowful. However, I hope they do not think &s;o ill of him as I do.

<P>I was very glad I did not &s;it next the Captain, for he could not bear the mu&s;ic, or &s;ingers, and was extremely gro&s;s in his ob&s;ervations on both.

<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE came home from the ridotto &s;o late, or ra|ther, &s;o early, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to write. Indeed we did not <HI>go,</HI> you will be fright|ened to hear it,&mdash;till pa&s;t eleven o'clock: but nobody does. A terrible rever&s;e of the order of nature! We &s;leep with the &s;un, and wake with the moon.</P>
<P>The room was very magnificent, the lights and decorations brilliant, and the company gay and &s;plendid. But I &s;hould have told you, that I made very many objections to being of the party, according to the re&s;olution I had formed. How|ever, Maria laughed me out of my &s;cruples, and &s;o, once again&mdash;I went to an a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mirvan danced a minuet, but I had not the courage to follow her example. In our walks I &s;aw Lord Orville. He was quite alone, but did not ob&s;erve us. Yet, as he &s;eemed of no party, I thought it was not impo&s;&s;ible that he might join us; and tho' I did not wi&s;h much to dance at all,&mdash;yet, as I was more acquainted with him than with any other per&s;on in the room, I mu&s;t own I could not help thinking it would be infinitely more de&s;ireable to dance again with him, than with an entire &s;tranger. To be &s;ure, after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, it was very ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e it even probable, that Lord Orville would again honour
<PB N="44" REF="59">
me with his choice; yet I am compelled to con|fe&s;s my ab&s;urdity, by way of explaining what fol|lows.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mirvan was &s;oon engaged; and, pre&s;ently after, a very fa&s;hionable, gay-looking man, who &s;eemed about 30 years of age, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and begged to have the honour of dancing with me. Now Maria's partner was a gentleman of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance; for &s;he had told us it was highly improper for young women to dance with &s;trangers, at any public a&s;&s;embly. In|deed it was by no means my wi&s;h &s;o to do; yet I did not like to confine my&s;elf from dancing at all; neither did I dare refu&s;e this gentleman, as I had done Mr. Lovel, and then, if any acquaint|ance &s;hould offer, accept him: and &s;o, all the&s;e rea&s;ons combining, induced me to tell him&mdash;yet I blu&s;h to write it to you!&mdash;that I was <HI>already en|gaged;</HI> by which I meant to keep my&s;elf at liberty to dance or not, as matters &s;hould fall out.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e my con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s betrayed my artifice, for he looked at me as if incredulous; and, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with my an&s;wer, and leaving me, according to my expectation, he walked at my &s;ide, and, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable, began a conver&s;ation, in that free &s;tyle which only belongs to old and intimate acquaintance. But, what was mo&s;t provoking, he a&s;ked me a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning <HI>the partner to whom I was engaged.</HI> And, at la&s;t, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Is it really po&s;&s;ible that a man whom you have honoured with your accept|ance, can fail to be at hand to profit from your goodne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>I felt extremely fooli&s;h, and begged Mrs. Mir|van to lead to a &s;eat, which &s;he very obligingly did. The Captain &s;at next her, and, to my great &s;ur|pri&s;e,
<PB N="45" REF="60">
this gentleman thought proper to follow, and &s;eat him&s;elf next to me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What an in&s;en&s;ible!"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"why, Madam, you are mi&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t delightful dance in the world! The man mu&s;t be either mad, or a fool.&mdash;Which do you incline to think him your|&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, in &s;ome confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>He begged my pardon for the freedom of his &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I really was off my guard, from a&s;toni&s;hment that any man can be &s;o much and &s;o unaccountably his own enemy. But where, Madam, can he po&s;&s;ibly be?&mdash;has he left the room?&mdash;or has not he been in it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I peevi&s;hly, <Q REND="inline">"I know no|thing of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't wonder that you are di&s;concerted, Madam, it is really very provoking. The be&s;t part of the evening will be ab&s;olutely lo&s;t. He de&s;erves not that you &s;hould wait for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"and I beg you not to&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortifying, indeed, Madam,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"a lady to wait for a gentleman!&mdash;O fie!&mdash;care|le&s;s fellow!&mdash;what can detain him?&mdash;Will you give me leave to &s;eek him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you plea&s;e, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, quite terri|fied le&s;t Mrs. Mirvan &s;hould attend to him, for &s;he looked very much &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing me enter into conver&s;ation with a &s;tranger.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With all my heart,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"pray what coat has he on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I never looked at it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Out upon him!"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"What! did he addre&s;s you in a coat not worth looking at?&mdash;What a &s;habby dog!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="61">
How ridiculous! I really could not help laugh|ing, which, I fear, encouraged him, for he went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Charming creature!&mdash;and can you really bear ill u&s;age with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s?&mdash;Can you, <HI>like patience on a monument,</HI> &s;mile in the mid&s;t of di&s;appointment?&mdash;For my part, though I am not the offended per&s;on, my indignation is &s;o great, that I long to kick the fellow round the room!&mdash;unle&s;s, indeed,&mdash;(he&s;itating and looking earne&s;tly at me,) unle&s;s, indeed&mdash;it is a partner of your own <HI>creating?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I was dreadfully aba&s;hed, and could not make any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But no!"</Q> cried he, (again, and with warmth,) <Q REND="inline">"it cannot be that you are &s;o cruel! Softne&s;s it&s;elf is painted in your eyes:&mdash;You could not, &s;urely, have the barbarity &s;o wantonly to trifle with my mi&s;ery?"</Q></P>
<P>I turned away from this non&s;en&s;e, with real di&s;gu&s;t. Mrs. Mirvan &s;aw my confu&s;ion, but was perplexed what to think of it, and I could not ex|plain to her the cau&s;e, le&s;t the captain &s;hould hear me. I therefore propo&s;ed to walk, &s;he con&s;ented, and we all ro&s;e; but, would you believe it? this man had the a&s;&s;urance to ri&s;e too, and walk clo&s;e by my &s;ide, as if of my party!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I hope we &s;hall &s;ee this ingrate.&mdash;Is that he?"&mdash;</Q>pointing to an old man, who was lame, <Q REND="inline">"or that?"</Q> And in this manner he a&s;ked me of whoever was old or ugly in the room. I made no &s;ort of an&s;wer; and when he found that I was re&s;olutely &s;ilent, and walked on, as much as I could, without ob&s;erving him, he &s;uddenly &s;tamped his foot, and cried out, in a pa&s;|&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Fool! idiot! booby!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="62">
I turned ha&s;tily toward him: <Q REND="inline">"O Madam,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"forgive my vehemence, but I am di&s;tracted to think there &s;hould exi&s;t a wretch who can &s;light a ble&s;&s;ing for which I would forfeit my life!&mdash;O! that I could but meet him!&mdash;I would &s;oon&mdash;But I grow angry: pardon me, Madam, my pa&s;&s;ions are violent, and your injuries affect me!"</Q></P>
<P>I began to apprehend he was a madman, and &s;tared at him with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you are moved, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"generous creature!&mdash;but don't be alarmed, I am cool again, I am indeed,&mdash;upon my &s;oul I am,&mdash;I entreat you, mo&s;t lovely of mortals! I entreat you to be ea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I very &s;eriou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your leaving me; you are quite a &s;tran|ger to me, and I am both unu&s;ed, and aver&s;e to your language and your manners."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;eemed to have &s;ome effect on him. He made me a low bow, begged my pardon, and vowed he would not for the world offend me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, you mu&s;t leave me,"</Q> cried I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am gone, Madam, I am gone!"</Q> with a mo&s;t tragical air; and he marched away, a quick pace, out of &s;ight in a moment; but before I had time to congratulate my&s;elf, he was again at my elbow.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And could you really let me go, and not be &s;orry?&mdash;Can you &s;ee me &s;uffer torments inexpre&s;|&s;ible, and yet retain all your favour for that mi&s;|creant who flies you?&mdash;Ungrateful puppy!&mdash;I could ba&s;tinado him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake,"</Q> my dear, cried Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"who is he talking of?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed&mdash;I do not know, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"but I wi&s;h he would leave me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What's all that there?"</Q> cried the Captain.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="63">
The man made a low bow, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Only, Sir, a &s;light objection which this young lady makes to dancing with me, and which I am endeavour|ing to obviate. I &s;hall think my&s;elf greatly ho|noured, if you will intercede for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That lady, Sir,</Q> &s;aid the Captain coldly, <Q REND="inline">"is her own mi&s;tre&s;s."</Q> And he walked &s;ullenly on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You Madam,"</Q> &s;aid the man, (who looked de|lighted, to Mrs. Mirvan,) <Q REND="inline">"you, I hope, will have the goodne&s;s to &s;peak for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he gravely, <Q REND="inline">"I have not the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope when you have, Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, (undaunted,) <Q REND="inline">"you will honour me with your ap|probation; but while I am yet unknown to you, it would be truly generous in you to countenance me; and, I flatter my&s;elf, Madam, that you will not have cau&s;e to repent it."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan, with an embarra&s;&s;ed air, replied, <Q REND="inline">"I do not at all mean, Sir, to doubt your being a gentleman,&mdash;but,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But <HI>what,</HI> Madam?&mdash;that doubt removed, why a <HI>but?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, (with a good|humoured &s;mile,) <Q REND="inline">"I will even treat you with your own plainne&s;s, and try what effect that will have on you: I mu&s;t therefore tell you, once for all,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pardon me, Madam!"</Q> interrupted he eager|ly, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t not proceed with tho&s;e words, <HI>once for all;</HI> no, if <HI>I</HI> have been too <HI>plain,</HI> and though a <HI>man,</HI> de&s;erve a rebuke, remember, dear ladies, that if you <HI>copy,</HI> you ought, in ju&s;tice, to <HI>excu&s;e</HI> me."</Q></P>
<P>We both &s;tared at the man's &s;trange behaviour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be nobler than your &s;ex,"</Q> continued he, turn|ing to me, <Q REND="inline">"honour me with one dance, and give

up the ingrate who has merited &s;o ill your pa|tience."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan looked with a&s;toni&s;hment at us both. <Q REND="inline">"Who does he &s;peak of, my dear?&mdash;you never mentioned&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Madam!"</Q> exclaimed he, <Q REND="inline">"he was not worth mentioning&mdash;it is pity he was ever thought of; but let us forget his exi&s;tence. One dance is all I &s;olicit; permit me, madam, the honour of this young lady's hand; it will be a favour I &s;hall ever mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"favours and &s;trangers have with me no connection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you have hitherto,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"confined your benevolence to your intimate friends, &s;uffer me to be the fir&s;t for whom your charity is en|larged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, I know not what to &s;ay to you,&mdash;but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt her <HI>but</HI> with &s;o many urgent entreaties, that &s;he at la&s;t told me, I mu&s;t either go down one dance, or avoid his importunities by returning home. I he&s;itated which alternative to chu&s;e; but this impetuous man at length prevailed, and I was obliged to con&s;ent to dance with him.</P>
<P>And thus was my deviation from truth puni&s;hed; and thus did this man's determined boldne&s;s con|quer.</P>
<P>During the dance, before we were too much engaged in it for conver&s;ation, he was extremely provoking about <HI>my partner,</HI> and tried every means in his power to make me own that I had deceived him; which, though I would not &s;o far humble my&s;elf, was indeed but too obvious.</P>
<P>Lord Orville, I fancy, did not dance at all; he &s;eemed to have a large acquaintance, and joined
<PB N="50" REF="65">
&s;everal different parties: but you will ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;e I was not much plea&s;ed to &s;ee him, in a few minutes after I was gone, walk towards the place I had ju&s;t left, and bow to, and join Mrs. Mir|van!</P>
<P>How unlucky I thought my&s;elf, that I had not longer with&s;tood this &s;tranger's importunities! The moment we had gone down the dance, I was ha&s;|tening away from him, but he &s;topt me, and &s;aid that I could by no means return to my party, without giving offence, before we had <HI>done our duty of walk|ing up the dance.</HI> As I know nothing at all of the&s;e rules and cu&s;toms, I was obliged to &s;ubmit to his directions; but I fancy I looked rather unea&s;y, for he took notice of my inattention, &s;aying, in his free way, <Q REND="inline">"Whence that anxiety?&mdash;Why are tho&s;e lovely eyes perpetually averted?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h you would &s;ay no more to me, Sir,"</Q> (cried I peevi&s;hly) <Q REND="inline">"you have already de&s;troyed all my happine&s;s for this evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven; what is it I have done?&mdash;How have I merited this &s;corn?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have tormented me to death; you have forced me from my friends, and intruded your&s;elf upon me, again&s;t my will, for a partner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, my dear madam, we ought to be better friends, &s;ince there &s;eems to be &s;omething of a &s;ympathy in the frankne&s;s of our di&s;po&s;itions&mdash;And yet, were you not an angel&mdash;how do you think I could brook &s;uch contempt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I have offended you, cried I, you have but to leave me&mdash;and O how I wi&s;h you would!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear creature,"</Q> (cried he, half laugh|ing) <Q REND="inline">"why where could you be educated?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h I now was!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="66">
<Q REND="inline">"How con&s;cious you mu&s;t be, all beautiful that you are, that tho&s;e charming airs &s;erve only to heighten the bloom of your complexion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your freedom, Sir, where you are more ac|quainted, may perhaps be le&s;s di&s;agreeable; but to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me ju&s;tice,"</Q> (cried he, interrupting me) <Q REND="inline">"yes, I do indeed improve upon acquaint|ance; you will hereafter be quite charmed with me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hereafter, Sir, I hope I &s;hall never&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O hu&s;h!&mdash;hu&s;h!&mdash;have you forgot the &s;itu|ation in which I found you?&mdash;Have you forgot, that when de&s;erted, I pur&s;ued you,&mdash;when betrayed, I adored you?&mdash;but for me&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But for you, Sir, I might, perhaps, have been happy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, am I to conclude that, <HI>but for me,</HI> your <HI>partner</HI> would have appeared?&mdash;poor fellow!&mdash;and did my pre&s;ence awe him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h <HI>his</HI> pre&s;ence, Sir, could awe <HI>you!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His pre&s;ence!&mdash;perhaps then you &s;ee him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, I do;"</Q> cried I, quite wearied of his raillery.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where?&mdash;where?&mdash;for Heaven's &s;ake &s;hew me the wretch!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wretch, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, a very &s;avage!&mdash;a &s;neaking, &s;hame-faced, de&s;picable puppy!"</Q></P>
<P>I know not what bewitched me,&mdash;but my pride was hurt, and my &s;pirits were tired, and&mdash;in &s;hort&mdash;I had the &s;olly, looking at Lord Orville, to repeat, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De&s;picable,</HI> you think?"</Q></P>
<P>His eyes in&s;tantly followed mine; <Q REND="inline">"why, is <HI>that</HI> the gentleman?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="67">
I made no an&s;wer; I could not affirm, and I would not deny; for I hoped to be relieved from his teizing, by his mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The very moment we had done what he called our duty, I eagerly de&s;ired to return to Mrs. Mir|van.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To your <HI>partner,</HI> I pre&s;ume, Madam?"</Q> &s;aid he, very gravely.</P>
<P>This quite confounded me; I dreaded le&s;t this mi&s;chievous man, ignorant of his rank, &s;hould ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf to Lord Orville, and &s;ay &s;omething which might expo&s;e my artifice.

<P><Q REND="inline">"But your <HI>partner,</HI> Ma'am?"</Q> (&s;aid he, af|fecting a very &s;olemn air) <Q REND="inline">"perhaps he may re&s;ent my detaining you: if you will give me leave to a&s;k his con&s;ent&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not for the univer&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is he, Madam?"</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;hed my&s;elf a hundred miles off. He re|peated his que&s;tion. <Q REND="inline">"What is his name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing&mdash;nobody&mdash;I don't know.&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He a&s;&s;umed a mo&s;t important &s;olemnity; <Q REND="inline">"How!&mdash;not know? Give me leave, my dear Madam, to recommend this caution to you; never dance in public with a &s;tranger,&mdash;with one who&s;e name you are unacquainted with,&mdash;who may be a mere adventurer,&mdash;a man of no character,&mdash;con|&s;ider to what impertinence you may expo&s;e your|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Was ever any thing &s;o ridiculous? I could not help laughing, in &s;pite of my vexation.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="68">
At this in&s;tant, Mrs. Mirvan, followed by Lord Orville, walked up to us. You will ea&s;ily believe it was not difficult for me to recover my gravity; but what was my con&s;ternation, when this &s;trange man, de&s;tined to be the &s;courge of my artifice, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ha! my Lord Orville!&mdash;I prote&s;t I did not know your Lord&s;hip.

<P>My &s;hame and confu&s;ion were un&s;peakable. Who could have &s;uppo&s;ed or fore&s;een that this man knew Lord Orville! But fal&s;ehood is not more unju&s;tifiable than un&s;afe.</P>
<P>Lord Orville&mdash;well he might,&mdash;looked all amazement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The philo&s;ophic coldne&s;s of your Lord&s;hip,"</Q> continued this odious creature, <Q REND="inline">"every man is not endowed with.

<P>In the &s;ame in&s;tant, Lord Orville took it of him; I coloured violently, and made an effort to recover it. <Q REND="inline">"You do me too much honour, Sir, cried he,"</Q> (with an air of gallantry, pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips ere he let it go) <Q REND="inline">"however, I &s;hall be happy to profit by it, if this lady,"</Q> (turning to Mrs. Mirvan) <Q REND="inline">"will permit me to &s;eek for her party."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69">
To compel him thus to dance, I could not en|dure, and eagerly called out, <Q REND="inline">"By no means,&mdash;not for the world!&mdash;I mu&s;t beg&mdash;"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am;&mdash;any thing, I mean.&mdash;"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, my dear,"</Q> (cried Mrs. Mirvan, who could no longer contain her &s;ur|pri&s;e,) <Q REND="inline">"what does all this mean?&mdash;were you pre-engaged?&mdash;had Lord Orville?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Madam, cried I,&mdash;only,&mdash;only I did not know that gentleman,&mdash;and &s;o,&mdash;and &s;o I thought&mdash;I intended&mdash;I&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Overpowered by all that had pa&s;&s;ed, I had not &s;trength to make my mortifying explanation;&mdash;my &s;pirits quite &s;ailed me, and I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="70">
They all &s;eemed &s;hocked and amazed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is the matter, my deare&s;t love?"</Q> cried Mrs. Mirvan, with the kinde&s;t concern.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What have I done?"</Q> exclaimed my evil ge|nius, and ran officiou&s;ly for a gla&s;s of water.</P>
<P>However, a hint was &s;ufficient for Lord Orville, who comprehended all I would have explained. He immediately led me to a &s;eat, and &s;aid, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"Be not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I be&s;eech you; I &s;hall ever think my name honoured by your making u&s;e of it."</Q></P>
<P>This politene&s;s relieved me. A general mur|mur had alarmed Mi&s;s Mirvan, who flew in&s;tantly to me; while Lord Orville, the moment Mrs. Mirvan had taken the water, led my tormentor away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, dear Madam,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"let me go home,&mdash;indeed I cannot &s;tay here any longer."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"But the Captain&mdash;what will he &s;ay?&mdash;I had better go home in a chair."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan con&s;ented, and I ro&s;e to depart. Lord Orville and that man both came to me. The fir&s;t, with an attention I had but ill merited from him, led me to a chair,, while the other followed, pe&s;tering me with apologies. I wi&s;hed to have made mine to Lord Orville, but was too much a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>It was about one o'clock. Mrs. Mirvan's &s;er|vants &s;aw me home.</P>
<P>And now,&mdash;what again &s;hall ever tempt me to an a&s;&s;embly? I dread to hear what you will think of me, my mo&s;t dear and honoured Sir: you will need your utmo&s;t partiality to receive me without di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="71">
This morning Lord Orville has &s;ent to enquire after our healths: and Sir Clement Willoughby, for that, I find, is the name of my per&s;ecutor, has called: but I would not go down &s;tairs till he was gone.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Sir, I can &s;omewhat account for the &s;trange, provoking, and ridiculous conduct of this Sir Clement la&s;t night; for Mi&s;s Mirvan &s;ays, he is the very man with whom &s;he heard Lord Orville conver&s;ing at Mrs. Stanley's, when I was &s;poken of in &s;o mortifying a manner. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay he was glad to hear I was a fool, and therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, he concluded he might talk as much non&s;en&s;e as he plea&s;ed to me: however, I am very indifferent as to his opinion;&mdash;but for Lord Orville,&mdash;if then he thought me an idiot, now, I am &s;ure, he mu&s;t believe me both bold and pre&s;uming.

<P>The Captain intends to take us to-night to the Fantocini. I cannot bear that Captain; I can give you no idea how gro&s;s he is. I heartily rejoice that he was not pre&s;ent at the di&s;agreeable con|clu&s;ion of ye&s;terday's adventure, for I am &s;ure he would have contributed to my confu&s;ion; which might perhaps have diverted him, as he &s;eldom or never &s;miles but at &s;ome other per&s;on's ex|pence.</P>
<P>And here I conclude my London letters;&mdash;and without any regret, for I am too inexperienced and ignorant to conduct my&s;elf with propriety in

this town, where every thing is new to me, and many things are unaccountable and perplexing.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir; Heaven re&s;tore me &s;afely to you! I wi&s;h I was to go immediately to Berry Hill; yet the wi&s;h is ungrateful to Mrs. Mirvan, and therefore I will repre&s;s it.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Queen-Ann-&s;treet, <DATE>April 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW much will you be &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear|e&s;t Sir, at receiving another letter from London of your Evelina's writing! But, believe me, it was not my fault, neither is it my happine&s;s, that I am &s;till here: our journey has been po&s;tponed by an accident equally unexpected and di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>We went la&s;t night to &s;ee the Fantocini, where we had infinite entertainment from the perform|ance of a little comedy, in French and Italian, by puppets, &s;o admirably managed, that they both a&s;toni&s;hed and diverted us all, except the Captain, who has a fixed and mo&s;t prejudiced hatred of whatever is not Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>When it was over, while we waited for the coach, a tall elderly woman bru&s;hed quickly pa&s;t us, calling out, <Q REND="inline">"My God! what &s;hall I do?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="73">
<Q REND="inline">"Why what <HI>would</HI> you do,"</Q> cried the Captain.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi, Mon&s;ieur,</HI>"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I have lo&s;t my company, and in this place I don't know nobody."</Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething foreign in her accent, though it was difficult to di&s;cover whether &s;he was an Engli&s;h or a French woman. She was very well dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;eemed &s;o entirely at a lo&s;s what to do, that Mrs. Mirvan propo&s;ed to the Captain to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A&s;&s;i&s;t her!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"ay, with all my heart;&mdash;let a link-boy call her a coach."</Q></P>
<P>There was not one to be had, and it rained very fa&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mon Dieu,</HI>"</Q> exclaimed the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall become of me? <HI>Je &s;uis au d&eacute;&s;e&s;poir!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"pray let us take the poor lady into our coach. She is quite alone, and a foreigner&mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's never the better for that,"</Q> an&s;wered he: <Q REND="inline">"&s;he may be a woman of the town, for any thing you know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She does not appear &s;uch,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"and indeed &s;he &s;eems &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that we &s;hall but follow the golden rule, if we carry her to her lodgings."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are mighty fond of new acquaintance,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"but fir&s;t let us know if &s;he be going our way."</Q></P>
<P>Upon enquiry, we found that &s;he lived in Ox|ford Road, and, after &s;ome di&s;puting, the Captain, &s;urlily, and with a very bad grace, con&s;ented to admit her into his coach; though he &s;oon con|vinced us, that he was determined &s;he &s;hould not be too much obliged to him, for he &s;eemed ab|&s;olutely bent upon quarrelling with her: for which
<PB N="59" REF="74">
&s;trange inho&s;pitality, I can a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on, than that &s;he appeared to be a foreigner.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation began, by her telling us, that &s;he had been in England only two days; that the gentlemen belonging to her were Pari&s;ians, and had left her, to &s;ee for a hackney-coach, as her own carriage was abroad; and that &s;he had waited for them till &s;he was quite frightened, and con|cluded that they had lo&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"why did you go to a public place without an Engli&s;hman?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e none of my acquaintance is in town."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you what; your be&s;t way is to go out of it your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie, Mon&s;ieur,</HI>"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;o I &s;hall; for, I promi&s;e you, I think the Engli&s;h a parcel of brutes; and I'll go back to France as fa&s;t as I can, for I would not live among none of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who wants you?"</Q> cried the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"do you &s;uppo&s;e, Madam French, we have not enough of other nations to pick our pockets already? I'll warrant you, there's no need of you for to put in your oar."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pick your pockets, Sir! I wi&s;h nobody wanted to pick your pockets no more than I do; and I'll promi&s;e you, you'd be &s;afe enough. But there's no nation under the &s;un can beat the Engli&s;h for ill-politene&s;s: for my part, I hate the very &s;ight of them, and &s;o I &s;hall only ju&s;t vi&s;it a per&s;on of quality or two, of my particular acquaintance, and then I &s;hall go back again to France."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, do,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and then go to the devil together, for that's the fitte&s;t voyage for the French and the quality."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="75">
<Q REND="inline">"We'll take care, however,"</Q> cried the &s;tranger, with great vehemence, <Q REND="inline">"not to admit none of your vulgar, unmannered Engli&s;h among us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O never fear,"</Q> (returned he coolly) <Q REND="inline">"we &s;han't di&s;pute the point with you; you and the quality may have the devil all to your&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>De&s;irous of changing the &s;ubject of a conver|&s;ation which now became very alarming, Mi&s;s Mirvan called out, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, how &s;low the man drives!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never mind, Moll,"</Q> &s;aid her father, <Q REND="inline">"I'll warrant you he'll drive fa&s;t enough to-morrow, when you're going to Howard Grove."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Howard Grove!"</Q> exclaimed the &s;tranger; <Q REND="inline">"why, <HI>mon Dieu,</HI> do you know Lady Howard?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what if we do?"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"that's nothing to you; &s;he's none of <HI>your</HI> quality, I'll promi&s;e you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who told you that?</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you don't know nothing about the matter; be&s;ides, you're the ill-brede&s;t per&s;on ever I &s;ee; and as to your knowing Lady Howard, I don't believe no &s;uch a thing; unle&s;s, indeed, you are her &s;teward."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain, &s;wearing terribly, &s;aid, with great fury, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>you</HI> would much &s;ooner be taken for her wa&s;h-woman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her wa&s;h-woman, indeed!&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;why you han't no eyes; did you ever &s;ee a wa&s;h|woman in &s;uch a gown as this?&mdash;be&s;ides, I'm no &s;uch mean per&s;on, for I'm as good as Lady Howard, and as rich too; and be&s;ides, I'm now come to England to vi&s;it her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may &s;pare your&s;elf that there trouble,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he has paupers enough about her already."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="76">
<Q REND="inline">"Paupers, Mr.!&mdash;no more a pauper than your&s;elf, nor &s;o much neither;&mdash;but you're a low, dirty fellow, and I &s;han't &s;toop to take no more notice of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dirty fellow!"</Q> (exclaimed the Captain, &s;eiz|ing both her wri&s;ts) <Q REND="inline">"hark you, Mrs. Frog, you'd be&s;t hold your tongue, for I mu&s;t make bold to tell you, if you don't, that I &s;hall make no ceremony of tripping you out of the window; and there you may lie in the mud till &s;ome of your Mon&s;ieurs come to help you out of it."</Q></P>
<P>Their encrea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion quite terrified us; and Mrs. Mirvan was beginning to remon&s;trate with the Captain, when we were all &s;ilenced by what follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me go, villain that you are, let me go, or I'll promi&s;e you I'll get you put to pri&s;on for this u&s;age; I'm no common per&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you, and, <HI>ma foi,</HI> I'll go to Ju&s;tice Fielding about you; for I'm a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, and I'll make you know it, or my name i' n't Duval."</Q></P>
<P>I heard no more: amazed, frightened, and un|&s;peakably &s;hocked, an involuntary exclamation of <HI>Gracious Heaven!</HI> e&s;caped me, and more dead than alive, I &s;unk into Mrs. Mirvan's arms. But let me draw a veil over a &s;cene too cruel for a heart &s;o compa&s;&s;ionately tender as yours; it is &s;ufficient that you know this &s;uppo&s;ed foreigner proved to be Madame Duval,&mdash;the grandmother of your Evelina.</P>
<P>O, Sir, to di&s;cover &s;o near a relation in a woman who had thus introduced her&s;elf!&mdash;what would become of me, were it not for you, my protector, my friend, and my refuge?</P>
<P>My extreme concern, and Mrs. Mirvan's &s;ur|pri&s;e, immediately betrayed me. But I will not
<PB N="62" REF="77">
&s;hock you with the manner of her acknowledging me, or the bitterne&s;s, the <HI>gro&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;I cannot other|wi&s;e expre&s;s my&s;elf,&mdash;with which &s;he &s;poke of tho&s;e unhappy pa&s;t tran&s;actions you have &s;o pa|thetically related to me. All the mi&s;ery of a much|injured parent, dear, though never &s;een, regretted though never known, crowded &s;o forcibly upon my memory, that they rendered this interview&mdash;one only excepted&mdash;the mo&s;t afflicting I can ever know.</P>
<P>When we &s;topt at her lodgings, &s;he de&s;ired me to accompany her into the hou&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he could ea&s;ily procure a room for me to &s;leep in. Alarmed and trembling, I turned to Mrs. Mirvan. <Q REND="inline">"My daughter, Madam,</Q> &s;aid that &s;weet woman," <Q REND="inline">cannot &s;o abruptly part with her young friend; you mu&s;t allow a little time to wean them from each other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered Madame Du|val, (who, from the time of her being known &s;ome|what &s;oftened her manners) <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s can't po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o nearly connected to this child as I am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter for that,"</Q> cried the Captain, (who e&s;pou&s;ed my cau&s;e to &s;atisfy his own pique, though an awkward apology had pa&s;&s;ed between them) <Q REND="inline">"&s;he was &s;ent to us, and &s;o, d'ye &s;ee, we don't chu&s;e for to part with her."</Q></P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to wait upon her at what time &s;he plea&s;ed the next day, and, after a &s;hort debate, &s;he de&s;ired me to breakfa&s;t with her, and we pro|ceeded to Queen-Ann-Street.</P>
<P>What an unfortunate adventure! I could not clo&s;e my eyes the whole night. A thou&s;and times I wi&s;hed I had never left Berry Hill; however, my return thither &s;hall be accelerated to the utmo&s;t of my power; and once more in that abode of tran|quil
<PB N="63" REF="78">
happine&s;s, I will &s;uffer no temptation to al|lure me el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan was &s;o kind as to accompany me to Madame Duval's hou&s;e this morning. The Captain, too, offered his &s;ervice, which I de|clined, from a fear &s;he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e I meant to in&s;ult her.</P>
<P>She frowned mo&s;t terribly upon Mrs. Mirvan, but &s;he received me with as much tenderne&s;s as I believe &s;he is capable of feeling. Indeed, our meeting &s;eems really to have affected her; for when, overcome by the variety of emotions which the &s;ight of her occa&s;ioned, I almo&s;t fainted in her arms, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Let me not lo&s;e my poor daughter a &s;econd time!"</Q> This unexpected humanity &s;oftened me extremely; but &s;he very &s;oon excited my warme&s;t indignation, by the ungrateful mention &s;he made of the be&s;t of men, my dear, and mo&s;t generous benefactor. However, grief and anger mutually gave way to terror, upon her avowing the intention of her vi|&s;iting England was to make me return with her to France. This, &s;he &s;aid, was a plan &s;he had form|ed from the in&s;tant &s;he had heard of my birth, which, &s;he prote&s;ted, did not reach her ears till I mu&s;t have been twelve years of age; but Mon|&s;ieur Duval, who, &s;he declared, was the wor&s;t hu&s;band in the world, would not permit her to do any thing &s;he wi&s;hed: he had been dead but three months, which had been employed in ar|ranging certain affairs, that were no &s;ooner &s;ettled, than &s;he &s;et off for England. She was already out of mourning, for &s;he &s;aid nobody here could tell how long &s;he had been a widow.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t have been married very early in life; what her age is, I do not know, but &s;he really
<PB N="64" REF="79">
looks to be le&s;s than fifty. She dre&s;&s;es very gaily, paints very high, and the traces of former beauty are &s;till very vi&s;ible in her face.</P>
<P>I know not, when, or how, this vi&s;it would have ended, had not the Captain called for Mrs. Mir|van, and ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted upon my attending her. He is become, very &s;uddenly, &s;o warmly my friend, that I quite dread his officiou&s;ne&s;s. Mrs. Mirvan, however, who&s;e principal &s;tudy &s;eems to be healing tho&s;e wounds which her hu&s;band inflicts, appea&s;ed Madame Duval's wrath, by a very polite invita|tion to drink tea and &s;pend the evening here. Not without great difficulty was the Captain prevailed upon to defer his journey &s;ome time longer; but what could be done? it would have been indecent for me to have quitted the town the very in&s;tant I di&s;covered that Madame Duval was in it; and to have &s;tayed here &s;olely under her protection&mdash;Mrs. Mirvan, thank Heaven, was too kind for &s;uch a thought. That &s;he &s;hould follow us to Howard Grove, I almo&s;t equally dreaded; it is, therefore, determined that we remain in London for &s;ome days, or a week: though the Captain has de|clared that the <HI>old French hag,</HI> as he is plea&s;ed to call her, &s;hall fare never the better for it.</P>
<P>My only hope, is to get &s;afe to Berry Hill; where, coun&s;elled and &s;heltered by you, I &s;hall have nothing more to fear. Adieu, my ever dear and mo&s;t honoured Sir! I &s;hall have no happine&s;s till I am again with you!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry-Hill, <DATE>April 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the belief and hope that my Evelina would ere now have bid adieu to London, I had intended to have deferred writing, till I heard of her return to Howard Grove; but the letter I have this moment received, with intelligence of Madame Duval's ar|rival in England, demands an immediate an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Her journey hither equally grieves and alarms me: how much did I pity my child, when I read of a di&s;covery at once &s;o unexpected and unwi&s;hed! I have long dreaded this meeting and its con&s;e|quence; to claim you, &s;eems naturally to follow acknowledging you: I am well acquainted with her di&s;po&s;ition, and have for many years fore&s;een the conte&s;t which now threatens us.</P>
<P>Cruel as are the circum&s;tances of this affair, you mu&s;t not, my love, &s;uffer it to depre&s;s your &s;pirits; remember, that while life is lent me, I will devote it to your &s;ervice; and, for future time, I will make &s;uch provi&s;ion as &s;hall &s;eem to me mo&s;t conducive to your future happine&s;s. Se|cure of my protection, and relying on my tender|ne&s;s, let no apprehen&s;ions of Madame Duval di&s;|turb your peace; conduct your&s;elf towards her with all the re&s;pect and deference due to &s;o near a relation, remembering always, that the failure of duty on her part, can by no means ju&s;tify any ne|glect on yours: indeed, the more forcibly you are &s;truck with improprieties and mi&s;conduct in ano|ther,
<PB N="66" REF="81">
the greater &s;hould be your ob&s;ervance and diligence to avoid even the &s;hadow of &s;imilar er|rors. Be careful, therefore, that no remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of attention, no indifference of obliging, make known to her the independence I a&s;&s;ure you of; but when &s;he fixes the time for her leaving England, tru&s;t to me the ta&s;k of refu&s;ing your attending her: di&s;a|greeable to my&s;elf I own it will be, yet to you, it would be improper, if not impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In regard to her opinion of me, I am more &s;orry than &s;urpri&s;ed at her determined blindne&s;s; the palliation, which &s;he feels the want of, for her own conduct, leads her to &s;eek for failings in all who were concerned in tho&s;e unhappy tran&s;actions which &s;he has &s;o much rea&s;on to lament. And this, as it is the cau&s;e, &s;o we mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, con&s;ider it as the excu&s;e of her inveteracy.</P>
<P>How grateful to me are your wi&s;hes to return to Berry Hill! your lengthened &s;tay in London, and the di&s;&s;ipation in which I find you are involved, fill me with unea&s;ine&s;s: I mean not, however, that I would have you &s;eque&s;ter your&s;elf from the party to which you belong, &s;ince Mrs. Mirvan might thence infer a reproof which your youth and her kindne&s;s would render inexcu&s;able. I will not, therefore, enlarge upon this &s;ubject, but content my&s;elf with telling you, that I &s;hall heartily re|joice when I hear of your &s;afe arrival at How|ard Grove, for which place I hope you will be preparing at the time you receive this letter.</P>
<P>I cannot too much thank you, my be&s;t Evelina, for the minutene&s;s of your communications; con|tinue to me this indulgence, for I &s;hould be mi|&s;erable if in ignorance of your proceedings.</P>
<P>How new to you is the &s;cene of life in which you are now engaged,&mdash;balls&mdash;plays&mdash;operas&mdash;ri|dottos
<PB N="67" REF="82">
&mdash;Ah, my child! at your return hither, how will you bear the change? My heart trembles for your future tranquillity.&mdash;Yet I will hope every thing from the un&s;ullied whitene&s;s of your &s;oul, and the native liveline&s;s of your di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I need not &s;ay, how much more I was plea&s;ed with the mi&s;takes of your inexperience at the private ball, than with the attempted adoption of more fa&s;hionable manners at the ridotto. But your confu&s;ion and mortifications were &s;uch as to entirely &s;ilence all reproofs on my part.</P>
<P>I hope you will &s;ee no more of Sir Clement Wil|loughby, who&s;e conver&s;ation and boldne&s;s are ex|tremely di&s;gu&s;tful to me. I was gratified by the good-nature of Lord Orville, upon your making u&s;e of his name, but I hope you will never again put it to &s;uch a trial.</P>
<P>Heaven ble&s;s thee, my dear child, and grant that neither misfortune nor vice may ever rob thee of that gaiety of heart which, re&s;ulting from in|nocence, while it con&s;titutes your own, contributes al&s;o to the felicity of all who know you!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Queen-Ann-Street, <DATE>Thur&s;day morning, April 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE our dinner was over ye&s;terday, Ma|dame Duval came to tea; though it will le&s;&s;en your &s;urpri&s;e, to hear that it was near five o'clock, for we never dine till the day is almo&s;t over. She was a&s;ked into another room, while the table was
<PB N="68" REF="83">
cleared, and then was invited to partake of the de&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>She was attended by a French gentleman, whom &s;he introduced by the name of Mon&s;ieur Du Bois: Mrs. Mirvan received them both with her u&s;ual politene&s;s; but the Captain looked very much di&s;|plea&s;ed, and, after a &s;hort &s;ilence, very &s;ternly &s;aid to Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"Pray who a&s;ked you to bring that there &s;park with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I never go no-where with|out him."</Q></P>
<P>Another &s;hort &s;ilence en&s;ued, which was termi|nated by the Captain's turning roughly to the fo|reigner, and &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Do you know, Mon&s;ieur, that you're the fir&s;t Frenchman I ever let come into my hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Bois made a profound bow. He &s;peaks no Engli&s;h and under&s;tands it &s;o imperfectly, that he might po&s;&s;ibly imagine he had received a compliment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan endeavoured to divert the Cap|tain's ill-humour, by &s;tarting new &s;ubjects; but he left to her all the trouble of &s;upporting them, and leant back in his chair in gloomy &s;ilence, ex|cept when any opportunity offered of uttering &s;ome &s;arca&s;m upon the French. Finding her efforts to render the evening agreeable were fruitle&s;s, Mrs. Mirvan propo&s;ed a party to Ranelagh. Madame Duval joyfully con&s;ented to it, and the Captain, though he railed again&s;t the di&s;&s;ipation of the wo|men, did not oppo&s;e it, and therefore Maria and I ran up &s;tairs to dre&s;s our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before we were ready, word was brought us, that Sir Clement Willoughby was in the draw|ing-room. He introduced him&s;elf under the pre|tence of enquiring after all our healths, and entered
<PB N="69" REF="84">
the room with the ea&s;y air of an old acquaintance; though Mrs. Mirvan confe&s;&s;es that he &s;eemed em|barra&s;&s;ed, when he found how coldly he was re|ceived, not only by the Captain, but by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was extremely di&s;concerted at the thoughts of &s;eeing this man again, and did not go down &s;tairs till I was called to tea. He was then deeply en|gaged in a di&s;cour&s;e upon French manners with Madame Duval and the Captain, and the &s;ubject &s;eemed &s;o entirely to engro&s;s him, that he did not, at fir&s;t, ob&s;erve my entrance into the room. Their conver&s;ation was &s;upported with great vehemence; the Captain roughly maintaining the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h in every particular, and Madame Duval warmly refu&s;ing to allow of it in any; while Sir Clement exerted all his powers of argu|ment and of ridicule to &s;econd and &s;trengthen whatever was advanced by the Captain: for he had the &s;agacity to di&s;cover, that he could take no method &s;o effectual for making the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e his friend, as to make Madame Duval his enemy: and indeed, in a very &s;hort time, he had rea&s;on to congratulate him&s;elf upon his &s;ucce&s;s|ful di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw me he made a mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful bow, and hoped I had not &s;uffered from the fatigue of the ridotto: I made no other an&s;wer than a &s;light inclination of the head, for I was very much a&s;hamed of that whole affair. He then returned to the di&s;putants, where he mana|ged the argument &s;o &s;kilfully, at once provoking Madame Duval and delighting the Captain, that I could not forbear admiring his addre&s;s, though I condemned his &s;ubtlety. Mrs. Mirvan, dreading &s;uch violent antagoni&s;ts, attempted frequently to change the &s;ubject; and &s;he might have &s;ucceeded
<PB N="70" REF="85">
but for the interpo&s;ition of Sir Clement, who would not &s;uffer it to be given up, and &s;upported it with &s;uch humour and &s;atire, that he &s;eems to have won the Captain's heart; though their uni|ted forces &s;o enraged and overpowered Madame Duval, that &s;he really trembled with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was very glad when Mrs. Mirvan &s;aid it was time to be gone. Sir Clement aro&s;e to take leave; but the Captain very cordially invited him to join our party: he <HI>had</HI> an engagement, he &s;aid, but would give it up to have that plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Some little confu&s;ion en&s;ued in regard to our manner of &s;etting off: Mrs. Mirvan offered Ma|dame Duval a place in her coach, and propo&s;ed that we four females &s;hould go all together; how|ever, this &s;he rejected, declaring &s;he would by no means go &s;o far without a gentleman, and won|dering &s;o polite a lady could make <HI>&s;o Engli&s;h</HI> a propo&s;al. Sir Clement Willoughby &s;aid his cha|riot was waiting at the door, and begged to know if it could be of any u&s;e. It was, at la&s;t, deci|ded, that a hackney-coach &s;hould be called for Mon&s;ieur Du Bois and Madame Duval, in which the Captain, and, at his reque&s;t, Sir Clement, went al&s;o; Mrs. and Mi&s;s Mirvan and I had a peaceful and comfortable ride by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I don't doubt but they quarrelled all the way; for when we met at Ranelagh, every one &s;eemed out of humour: and, though we joined parties, poor Madame Duval was avoided as much as po&s;|&s;ible by all but me, and I did not dare quit her for an in&s;tant: indeed I believe &s;he was re&s;olved I &s;hould not, for &s;he leant upon my arm almo&s;t all the evening.</P>
<P>The room was &s;o very much crowded, that, but for the uncommon a&s;&s;iduity of Sir Clement
<PB N="71" REF="86">
Willoughby, we &s;hould not have been able to pro|cure a box (which is the name given to the arched rece&s;&s;es which are appropriated for tea-parties) till half the company had retired. As we were taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our places, &s;ome ladies of Mrs. Mir|van's acquaintance &s;topped to &s;peak to her, and per&s;uaded her to <HI>take a round</HI> with them. When &s;he returned to us, what was my &s;urprize, to &s;ee that Lord Orville had joined her party! The ladies walked on; Mrs. Mirvan &s;eated her&s;elf, and made a &s;light, though re&s;pectful invitation to Lord Orville to drink his tea with us, which, to my no &s;mall con&s;ternation, he accepted.</P>
<P>I felt a confu&s;ion un&s;peakable at again &s;eeing him, from the recollection of the ridotto adven|ture: nor did my &s;ituation le&s;&s;en it, for I was &s;eated between Madame Duval and Sir Clement, who &s;eemed as little as my&s;elf to de&s;ire Lord Orville's pre&s;ence. Indeed, the continual wrangling and ill-breeding of Captain Mirvan and Madame Du|val, made me blu&s;h that I belonged to them. And poor Mrs. Mirvan and her amiable daughter had &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>A general &s;ilence en&s;ued after he was &s;eated: his appearance, from different motives, gave a univer&s;al re&s;traint to every body. What his own rea&s;ons were for honouring us with his company, I cannot imagine, unle&s;s, indeed, he had a curio&s;ity to know whether I &s;hould invent any new imperti|nence concerning him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;peech was made by Madame Duval, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It's quite a &s;hocking thing to &s;ee ladies come to &s;o genteel a place as Ranelagh with hats on; it has a mon&s;trous vulgar look: I can't think what they wear them for. There's no &s;uch a thing to be &s;een in Paris."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="87">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t own my&s;elf no advocate for hats; I am &s;orry the la|dies ever invented or adopted &s;o tantalizing a fa|&s;hion; for, where there is beauty, they only &s;erve to &s;hade it, and where there is none, to excite an unavailing curio&s;ity. I fancy they were originally worn by &s;ome young and whim&s;ical coquet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More likely,"</Q> an&s;wered the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"they were invented by &s;ome wrinkled old hag, who'd a mind for to keep the young fellows in chace, let them be never &s;o weary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know what you may do in England,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"but I know in Paris no woman need n't be at &s;uch a trouble as that, to be taken very genteel notice of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, will you pretend for to &s;ay,"</Q> returned the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"that they don't di&s;tingui&s;h the old from the young there as well as here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They don't make no di&s;tingui&s;hments at all,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"they're va&s;tly too polite."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More fools they!"</Q> &s;aid the Captain &s;neer|ingly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"that, for our own &s;akes, we Engli&s;hmen too were ble&s;t with &s;o accommodating a blindne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why the devil do you make &s;uch a prayer as that?"</Q> demanded the Captain: <Q REND="inline">"them are the fir&s;t fooli&s;h words I've heard you &s;peak; but I &s;uppo&s;e you're not much u&s;ed to that &s;ort of work. Did you ever make a prayer before, &s;ince you were a &s;niveler?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, now,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"that's another of the unpolitene&s;&s;es of you Engli&s;h, to go to talking of &s;uch things as that: now, in Paris, nobody never &s;ays nothing about religion, no more than about politics."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="88">
<Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"it's a &s;ign they take no more care of their &s;ouls, than of their country, and &s;o both one and t'other go to old Nick."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, if they do,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"who's the wor&s;e, &s;o long as they don't &s;ay nothing about it? it's the tire&s;ome&s;t thing in the world to be always talking of them &s;ort of things, and nobody that's ever been abroad troubles their heads about them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray then,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you know &s;o much of the matter, be &s;o good as to tell us what they <HI>do</HI> trouble their heads about?&mdash;hay, Sir Clement! ha'n't we a right to know that much?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A very comprehen&s;ive que&s;tion,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"and I expect much in&s;truction from the lady's an&s;wer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, Madam,"</Q> continued the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"never flinch; &s;peak at once; don't &s;top for thinking."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you I am not going,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"for as to what they <HI>do</HI> do, why they've enough to do, I promi&s;e you, what with one thing or ano|ther."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But <HI>what, what</HI> do they do, the&s;e famous Mon&s;ieurs?"</Q> demanded the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"can't you tell us? do they game?&mdash;or drink?&mdash;or fiddle?&mdash;or are they jockies?&mdash;or do they &s;pend all their time in &s;lummering old women?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to that, Sir,&mdash;but indeed I &s;han't trouble my&s;elf to an&s;wer &s;uch a parcel of low que&s;tions, &s;o don't a&s;k me no more about it."</Q> And then, to my great vexation, turning to Lord Orville, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, was you ever in Paris?"</Q></P>
<P>He only bowed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, Sir, how did you like it?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="89">
This <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> que&s;tion, as Sir Clement would have called it, though it made him &s;mile, al&s;o made him he&s;itate; however, his an&s;wer was expre&s;&s;ive of his approbation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought you would like it, Sir, becau&s;e you look &s;o like a gentleman. As to the Captain, and as to that other gentleman, why they may very well not like what they don't know: for I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you was never abroad?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Only three years, Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Clement, drily.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, that's very &s;urpri&s;ing! I &s;hould never have thought it: however, I dare &s;ay you only kept company with the Engli&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why pray, who <HI>&s;hould</HI> he keep company with?"</Q> cried the Captain: <Q REND="inline">"what, I &s;uppo&s;e you'd have him a&s;hamed of his own nation, like &s;ome other people, not a thou&s;and miles off, on purpo&s;e to make his own nation a&s;hamed of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure it would be a very good thing if you'd go abroad your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How will you make out that, hay, Madam? come, plea&s;e to tell me, where would be the good of that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where! why a great deal. They'd make quite another per&s;on of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, I &s;uppo&s;e you'd have me learn to cut capers?&mdash;and dre&s;s like a monkey?&mdash;and palavar in French gibberi&s;h?&mdash;hay, would you?&mdash;And powder, and daub, and make my&s;elf up, like &s;ome other folks?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir, and not to talk to ladies in &s;uch a rude, old-fa|&s;hion way as this. You, Sir, as have been in Pa|ris"</Q> (again addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Lord Orville) <Q REND="inline">"can tell this Engli&s;h gentleman how he'd be de&s;pi&s;ed,
<PB N="75" REF="90">
if he was to talk in &s;uch an ungenteel manner as this, before any foreigners. Why there is n't a hair-dre&s;&s;er, nor a &s;hoe-maker, nor nobody, that would n't blu&s;h to be in your company."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why look ye, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered the Cap|tain, <Q REND="inline">"as to your hair-pinchers and &s;hoe-blacks, you may puff off their manners, and welcome; and I am heartily glad you like 'em &s;o well; but, as to me, &s;ince you mu&s;t needs make &s;o free of your advice, I mu&s;t e'en tell you, I never kept company with any &s;uch gentry."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, ladies and gentlemen,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"as many of you as have done tea, I invite to walk with me."</Q> Maria and I &s;tarted up in&s;tantly; Lord Orville followed; and I que&s;tion whether we were not half round the room ere the angry di&s;putants knew that we had left the box.</P>
<P>As the hu&s;band of Mrs. Mirvan had borne &s;o large a &s;hare in this di&s;agreeable altercation, Lord Orville forbore to make any comments upon it; &s;o that the &s;ubject was immediately dropt, and the conver&s;ation became calmly &s;ociable, and po|litely chearful, and, to every body but me, mu&s;t have been highly agreeable:&mdash;but, as to my&s;elf, I was &s;o eagerly de&s;irous of making &s;ome apology to Lord Orville for the impertinence of which he mu&s;t have thought me guilty at the ridotto, and yet &s;o utterly unable to a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient courage to &s;peak to him concerning an affair in which I had &s;o terribly expo&s;ed my&s;elf, that I hardly ven|tured to &s;ay a word all the time we were walk|ing. Be&s;ides, the knowledge of his contemptuous opinion, haunted and di&s;pirited me, and made me fear he might po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;con&s;true whatever I &s;hould &s;ay. So that, far from enjoying a conver|&s;ation
<PB N="76" REF="91">
that might, at any other time, have de|lighted me, I continued &s;ilent, uncomfortable, and a&s;hamed. O Sir, &s;hall I ever again involve my&s;elf in &s;o fooli&s;h an embarra&s;&s;ment? I am &s;ure that if I do, I &s;hall de&s;erve yet greater mortification.</P>
<P>We were not joined by the re&s;t of the party till we had taken three or four turns round the room, and then, they were &s;o quarrel&s;ome, that Mrs. Mirvan complained of being fatigued, and propo|&s;ed going home. No one di&s;&s;ented. Lord Or|ville joined another party, having fir&s;t made an offer of his &s;ervices, which the gentlemen de|clined, and we proceeded to an outward room, where we waited for the carriages. It was &s;ettled that we &s;hould return to town in the &s;ame man|ner we came to Ranelagh, and, accordingly, Mon|&s;ieur Du Bois handed Madame Duval into a hack|ney-coach, and was ju&s;t preparing to follow her, when &s;he &s;creamed, and jumpt ha&s;tily out, de|claring &s;he was wet through all her clothes. In|deed, upon examination, the coach was found to be in a di&s;mal condition; for the weather proved very bad, and the rain had, though I know not how, made its way into the carriage.</P>
<P>Mrs. and Mi&s;s Mirvan, and my&s;elf, were al|ready di&s;po&s;ed of as before; but no &s;ooner did the Captain hear this account, than, without any ceremony, he was &s;o civil as to immediately take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the vacant &s;eat in his own coach, leaving Madame Duval and Mon&s;ieur Du Bois to take care of them&s;elves. As to Sir Clement Wil|loughby, his own chariot was in waiting.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly begged permi&s;&s;ion to offer Madame Duval my own place, and made a motion to get out; but Mrs. Mirvan &s;topped me, &s;aying that I
<PB N="77" REF="92">
&s;hould then be obliged to return to town with only the foreigner, or Sir Clement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O never mind the old Beldame,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he's weather-proof, I'll an&s;wer for her; and be&s;ides, as we are all, I hope, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> why &s;he'll meet with no wor&s;e than &s;he expects from us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not mean to defend her,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan; <Q REND="inline">"but indeed, as &s;he belongs to our par|ty, we cannot, with any decency, leave the place, till &s;he is, by &s;ome means, accommodated."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, my dear,"</Q> cried the Captain, whom the di&s;tre&s;s of Madame Duval had put into very good humour, <Q REND="inline">"why &s;he'll break her heart, if &s;he meets with any civility from a filthy Engli&s;hman."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan, however, prevailed, and we all got out of the coach, to wait till Madame Duval could meet with &s;ome better carriage. We found her, attended by Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, &s;tanding among&s;t the &s;ervants, and very bu&s;y in wiping her negligee, and endeavouring to &s;ave it from being &s;tained by the wet, as &s;he &s;aid it was a new Lyons &s;ilk. Sir Clement Willoughby offered her the u&s;e of his chariot, but &s;he had been too much piqued by his raillery to accept it. We waited &s;ome time, but in vain, for no hackney-coach could be procured. The Captain, at la&s;t, was per&s;uaded to accompany Sir Clement him&s;elf, and we four females were handed into Mrs. Mirvan's carriage, though not before Madame Duval had in&s;i&s;ted upon our making room for Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, to which the Captain only con&s;ented in pre|ference to being incommoded by him in Sir Cle|ment's chariot.</P>
<P>Our party drove off fir&s;t. We were &s;ilent and un&s;ociable; for the difficulties attending this ar|rangement
<PB N="78" REF="93">
had made every one languid and fa|tigued. Un&s;ociable, I mu&s;t own, we continued; but very &s;hort was the duration of our &s;ilence, as we had not proceeded thirty yards, ere every voice was heard at once,&mdash;for the coach broke down! I &s;uppo&s;e we concluded of cour&s;e, that we were all half killed, by the violent &s;hrieks that &s;eemed to come from every mouth. The chariot was &s;topped, the &s;ervants came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and we were all taken out of the carriage, with|out having been at all hurt. The night was dark and wet; but I had &s;carce touched the ground, when I was lifted &s;uddenly from it, by Sir Clement Willoughby, who begged permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, though he did not wait to have it granted, but car|ried me in his arms back to Ranelagh.</P>
<P>He enquired very earne&s;tly if I was not hurt by the accident? I a&s;&s;ured him I was perfectly &s;afe, and free from injury, and de&s;ired he would leave me, and return to the re&s;t of the party, for I was very unea&s;y to know whether they had been equally fortunate. He told me he was happy in being honoured with my commands, and would joyfully execute them; but in&s;i&s;ted upon fir&s;t con|ducting me to a warm room, as I had not wholly e&s;caped being wet. He did not regard my objec|tions, but made me follow him to an apartment, where we found an excellent fire, and &s;ome com|pany waiting for carriages. I readily accepted a &s;eat, and then begged he would go.</P>
<P>And go, indeed, he did; but he returned in a moment, telling me that the rain was more violent than ever, and that he had &s;ent his &s;ervants to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and acquaint <HI>the Mirvans</HI> of my &s;ituation. I was very mad that he would not go him&s;elf; but as my acquaintance with him
<PB N="79" REF="94">
was &s;o very &s;light, I did not think proper to urge him contrary to his inclination.</P>
<P>Well, he drew a chair clo&s;e to mine, and, after again enquiring how I did, &s;aid, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"You will pardon me, Mi&s;s Anville, if the eager|ne&s;s I feel to vindicate my&s;elf, induces me to &s;natch this opportunity of making &s;incere acknowledg|ments for the impertinence with which I torment|ed you at the la&s;t ridotto. I can a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, I have been a true and &s;orrowful peni|tent ever &s;ince; but&mdash;&s;hall I tell you hone&s;tly what encouraged me to&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topt; but I &s;aid nothing, for I thought in&s;tantly of the conver&s;ation Mi&s;s Mirvan had overheard, and &s;uppo&s;ed he was going to tell me him&s;elf what part Lord Orville had borne in it; and really I did not wi&s;h to hear it repeated. In|deed, the re&s;t of his &s;peech convinces me that &s;uch was his intention; with what view, I know not, except to make a merit of his defending me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And yet,</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"my excu&s;e may only expo&s;e my own credulity, and want of judg|ment and penetration. I will, therefore, merely be&s;eech your pardon, and hope that &s;ome future time&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, the door was opened by Sir Clement's &s;ervant, and I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the Cap|tain, Mrs. and Mi&s;s Mirvan, enter the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O ho,"</Q> cried the former, <Q REND="inline">"you have got a good warm birth here; but we &s;hall beat up your quarters. Here, Lucy, Moll, come to the fire, and dry your trumpery. But, hey-day,&mdash;why where's old Madam French?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"is not Madame Duval then with you?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With me! No,&mdash;thank God."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="95">
I was very unea&s;y to know what might have become of her, and, if they would have &s;uffered me, I &s;hould have gone out in &s;earch of her my|&s;elf; but all the &s;ervants were di&s;patched to find her, and the Captain &s;aid we might be very &s;ure her <HI>French beau</HI> would take care of her.</P>
<P>We waited &s;ome time without any tidings, and were &s;oon the only party in the room. My un|ea&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ed &s;o much, that Sir Clement now made a voluntary offer of &s;eeking her. However, the &s;ame moment that he opened the door with this de&s;ign, &s;he pre&s;ented her&s;elf at it, attended by Mon&s;ieur Du Bois.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was this in&s;tant, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"coming to &s;ee for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are mighty good, truly,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"to come when all the mi&s;chief's over."</Q></P>
<P>She then entered,&mdash;in &s;uch a condition!&mdash;en|tirely covered with mud, and in &s;o great a rage, it was with difficulty &s;he could &s;peak. We all expre&s;&s;ed our concern, and offered our a&s;&s;i&s;tance,&mdash;except the Captain; who no &s;ooner beheld her, than he bur&s;t into a loud laugh.</P>
<P>We endeavoured, by our enquiries and condole|ments, to prevent her attending to him; and &s;he was, for &s;ome time, &s;o wholly engro&s;&s;ed by her anger and her di&s;tre&s;s, that we &s;ucceeded without much trouble. We begged her to inform us how this accident had happened. <Q REND="inline">"How!"</Q> repeated &s;he,&mdash;why <Q REND="inline">"it was all along of your all going away,&mdash;and there poor Mon&s;ieur Du Bois&mdash;but it was n't his fault,&mdash;for he's as bad off as me."</Q></P>
<P>All eyes were then turned to Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, who&s;e clothes were in the &s;ame mi&s;erable plight with tho&s;e of Madame Duval, and who, wet, &s;hivering, and di&s;con&s;olate, had crept to the fire.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="96">
The Captain laughed yet more heartily; while Mrs. Mirvan, a&s;hamed of his rudene&s;s, repeated her enquiries to Madame Duval; who an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Why, as we were a-coming along, all in the rain, Mon&s;ieur Du Bois was &s;o obliging, though I'm &s;ure it was an unlucky obligingne&s;s for me, as to lift me up in his arms, to carry me over a place that was ancle-deep in mud; but in&s;tead of my being ever the better for it, ju&s;t as we were in the wor&s;t part,&mdash;I'm &s;ure I wi&s;h we had been fifty miles off,&mdash;for &s;omehow or other, his foot &s;lipt,&mdash;at lea&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o,&mdash;though I can't think how it happened, for I'm no &s;uch great weight,&mdash;but, however that was, down we both came toge|ther, all in the mud;&mdash;and the more we tried to get up, the more deeper we got covered with the na&s;tine&s;s,&mdash;and my new Lyons negligee, too, quite &s;poilt!&mdash;however, it's well we got up at all, for we might have laid there till now, for aught you all cared; for nobody never came near us."</Q></P>
<P>This recital put the Captain into an extacy; he went from the lady to the gentleman, and from the gentleman to the lady, to enjoy alter|nately the &s;ight of their di&s;tre&s;s. He really &s;hout|ed with plea&s;ure; and, &s;haking Mon&s;ieur Du Bois &s;trenuou&s;ly by the hand, wi&s;hed him joy of having <HI>touched Engli&s;h ground;</HI> and then he held a candle to Madame Duval, that he might have a more complete view of her di&s;a&s;ter, declaring repeatedly, that he had never been better plea&s;ed in his life.</P>
<P>The rage of poor Madame Duval was un&s;peak|able; &s;he da&s;hed the candle out of his hand, &s;tamped upon the floor, and, at la&s;t, &s;pat in his face.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="97">
This action &s;eemed immediately to calm them both, as the joy of the Captain was converted into re&s;entment, and the wrath of Madame Duval into fear; for he put his hands upon her &s;houlders, and gave her &s;o violent a &s;hake, that &s;he &s;creamed out for help; a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame time, that if &s;he had been one ounce le&s;s old, or le&s;s ugly, &s;he &s;hould have had it all returned on her own face.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, who had &s;eated him&s;elf very quietly at the fire, approached them, and expo&s;tulated very warmly with the Captain; but he was neither under&s;tood nor regarded, and Ma|dame Duval was not relea&s;ed, till &s;he quite &s;obbed with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When they were parted, I entreated her to permit the woman who has the charge of the ladies cloaks to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in drying her clothes; &s;he con|&s;ented, and we did what was po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave her from catching cold. We were obliged to wait in this di&s;agreeable &s;ituation near an hour, ere a hackney-coach could be found; and then we were di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as before our ac|cident.</P>
<P>I am going this morning to &s;ee poor Madame Duval, and to enquire after her health, which I think mu&s;t have &s;uffered by her la&s;t night's mis|fortunes; though, indeed, &s;he &s;eems to be natu|rally &s;trong and hearty.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu, my dear Sir, till to-morrow.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Morning, April 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SIR Clement Willoughby called here ye&s;ter|day at noon, and Captain Mirvan invited him to dinner. For my part, I &s;pent the day in a manner the mo&s;t uncomfortable imaginable.</P>
<P>I found Madame Duval at breakfa&s;t in bed, though Mon&s;ieur Du Bois was in the chamber; which &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed me, that I was, invo|luntarily, retiring, without con&s;idering how odd an appearance my retreat would have, when Madame Duval called me back, and laughed very heartily at my ignorance of foreign cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, however, very &s;oon took a more &s;erious turn; for &s;he began, with great bit|terne&s;s, to inveigh again&s;t the <HI>barbarous brutality of that fellow the Captain,</HI> and the horrible ill|breeding of the Engli&s;h in general, declaring &s;he &s;hould make her e&s;cape with all expedition from &s;o <HI>bea&s;tly a nation.</HI></P>
<P>She lamented, very mournfully, the fate of her Lyons &s;ilk, and prote&s;ted &s;he had rather have parted with all the re&s;t of her wardrobe, becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t gown &s;he had bought to wear upon leaving off her weeds. She has a very bad cold, and Mon&s;ieur Du Bois is &s;o hoar&s;e, he can hardly &s;peak.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted upon my &s;taying with her all day, as &s;he intended, &s;he &s;aid, to introduce me to &s;ome of my own relations. I would very fain have
<PB N="84" REF="99">
excu&s;ed my&s;elf, but &s;he did not allow me any choice.</P>
<P>Till the arrival of the&s;e relations, one continu|ed &s;eries of que&s;tions on her &s;ide, and of an&s;wers on mine, filled up all the time we pa&s;&s;ed together. Her curio&s;ity was in&s;atiable; &s;he enquired into every action of my life, and every particular that had fallen under my ob&s;ervation, in the lives of all I knew. Again, &s;he was &s;o cruel as to avow the mo&s;t inveterate rancour again&s;t the &s;ole benefactor her de&s;erted child and grand-child have met with; and &s;uch was the indignation her in|gratitude rai&s;ed, that I would actually have quitted her pre&s;ence and hou&s;e, had &s;he not, in a man|ner the mo&s;t peremptory, ab&s;olutely forbid me. But what, good Heaven! can induce her to &s;uch &s;hocking inju&s;tice? O my friend and father! I have no command of my&s;elf when this &s;ubject is &s;tarted.</P>
<P>She talked very much of taking me to Paris, and &s;aid I greatly wanted the poli&s;h of a French education. She lamented that I had been brought up in the country, which, &s;he ob&s;erved, had given me a very <HI>bumpkini&s;h air.</HI> However, &s;he bid me not de&s;pair, for &s;he had known many girls, much wor&s;e than me, who had become very fine ladies after a few years re&s;idence abroad; and &s;he parti|cularly in&s;tanced a Mi&s;s Polly Moore, daughter of a chandler's-&s;hop woman, who, by an accident not worth relating, happened to be &s;ent to Paris, where, from an awkward, ill-bred girl, &s;he &s;o much improved, that &s;he has &s;ince been taken for a woman of quality.</P>
<P>The relations to whom &s;he was plea&s;ed to in|troduce me, con&s;i&s;ted of a Mr. Branghton, who is her nephew, and three of his children, the elde&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="100">
of which is a &s;on, and the two younger are daughters.</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton appears about forty years of age. He does not &s;eem to want a common un|der&s;tanding, though he is very contracted and pre|judiced: he has &s;pent his whole time in the city, and I believe feels a great contempt for all who re&s;ide el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>His &s;on &s;eems weaker in his under&s;tanding, and more gay in his temper; but his gaiety is that of a fooli&s;h, over-grown &s;chool-boy, who&s;e mirth con&s;i&s;ts in noi&s;e and di&s;turbance. He di&s;dains his father for his clo&s;e attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and love of money, though he &s;eems him&s;elf to have no talents, &s;pirit, or genero&s;ity, to make him &s;upe|rior to either. His chief delight appears to be tormenting and ridiculing his &s;i&s;ters, who, in re|turn, mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Branghton, the elde&s;t daughter, is by no means ugly, but looks proud, ill-tempered, and conceited. She hates the city, though without knowing why; for it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover &s;he has lived no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Polly Branghton is rather pretty, very fooli&s;h, very ignorant, very giddy, and, I believe, very good-natured.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t half hour was allotted to <HI>making them|&s;elves comfortable,</HI> for they complained of having had a very dirty walk, as they came on foot from Snow Hill, where Mr. Branghton keeps a &s;ilver|&s;mith's &s;hop; and the young ladies had not only their coats to bru&s;h, and &s;hoes to dry, but to ad|ju&s;t their head dre&s;s, which their bonnets had to|tally di&s;compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The manner in which Madame Duval was plea&s;ed to introduce me to this family, extremely
<PB N="86" REF="101">
&s;hocked me. <Q REND="inline">"Here, my dears,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"here's a relation you little thought of; but you mu&s;t know my poor daughter Caroline had this child after &s;he run away from me,&mdash;though I never knew nothing of it, not I, for a long while after; for they took care to keep it a &s;ecret from me, though the poor child has never a friend in the world be&s;ides."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s &s;eems very tender-hearted, aunt,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"and to be &s;ure &s;he's not to blame for her mama's undutifulne&s;s, for &s;he could n't help it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, no,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and I never took no notice of it to her; for indeed, as to that, my own poor daughter was n't &s;o much to blame as you may think, for &s;he'd never have gone a&s;tray, if it had not been for that meddling old par&s;on I told you of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If aunt plea&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid young Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"we'll talk o' &s;omewhat el&s;e, for Mi&s;s looks very unea&s;y-like."</Q></P>
<P>The next &s;ubject that was cho&s;en, was the age of the three young Branghtons and my&s;elf. The &s;on is twenty; the daughters upon hearing that I was &s;eventeen, &s;aid that was ju&s;t the age of Mi&s;s Polly; but their brother, after a long di&s;pute, proved that &s;he was two years older, to the great anger of both &s;i&s;ters, who agreed that he was very ill-natured and &s;piteful.</P>
<P>When this point was &s;ettled, the que&s;tion was put, which was talle&s;t?&mdash;We were de&s;ired to mea|&s;ure, as the Branghtons were all of different opi|nions. They, none of them, however, di&s;puted my being the talle&s;t in the company, but, in re|gard to one another, they were extremely quarrel|&s;ome: the brother in&s;i&s;ted upon their mea&s;uring
<PB N="87" REF="102">
<HI>fair,</HI> and not with <HI>heads</HI> and <HI>heels;</HI> but they would by no means con&s;ent to lo&s;e the&s;e privileges of our &s;ex, and therefore the young man was <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> as &s;horte&s;t; though he appealed to all pre&s;ent upon the inju&s;tice of the decree.</P>
<P>This ceremony over, the young ladies, began, very freely, to examine my dre&s;s, and to interro|gate me concerning it. <Q REND="inline">"This apron's your own work, I &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s? but the&s;e &s;prigs a'n't in fa&s;hion now. Pray, if it is not impertinent, what might you give a yard for this lute&s;tring?&mdash;Do you make your own caps, Mi&s;s?&mdash;"</Q> and many other que&s;tions equally intere&s;ting and well-bred.</P>
<P>They then a&s;ked me <HI>how I liked London?</HI> and whether I &s;hould not think the country a very <HI>dull place,</HI> when I returned thither? <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s mu&s;t try if &s;he can't get a good hu&s;band,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"and then &s;he may &s;tay and live here."</Q></P>
<P>The next topic was public places, or rather the theatres, for they knew of no other; and the me|rits and defects of all the actors and actre&s;&s;es were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: the young man here took the lead, and &s;eemed to be very conver&s;ant on the &s;ubject. But, during this time, what was my concern, and &s;uf|fer me to add, my indignation, when I found, by &s;ome words I occa&s;ionally heard, that Madame Duval was entertaining Mr. Branghton with all the mo&s;t &s;ecret and cruel particulars of my &s;ituation! The elde&s;t daughter was &s;oon drawn to them by the recital; the younge&s;t and the &s;on &s;till kept their places, intending, I believe, to divert me, though the conver&s;ation was all their own.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Mi&s;s Branghton, coming &s;ud|denly up to her &s;i&s;ter, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Polly, only think! Mi&s;s never &s;aw her papa!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="103">
<Q REND="inline">"Lord, how odd!"</Q> cried the other; <Q REND="inline">"why then, Mi&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e you would n't know him?"</Q></P>
<P>This was quite too much for me; I ro&s;e ha&s;tily, and ran out of the room: but I &s;oon regretted I had &s;o little command of my&s;elf, for the two &s;i&s;ters both followed, and in&s;i&s;ted upon comforting me, notwith&s;tanding my earne&s;t entreaties to be left alone.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I returned to the company, Madame Duval &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear, what was the matter with you? why did you run away &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P>This que&s;tion almo&s;t made me run again, for I knew not how to an&s;wer it. But is it not very extraordinary, that &s;he can put me in &s;ituations &s;o &s;hocking, and then wonder to find me &s;en&s;ible of any concern?</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton, junior, now enquired of me, whether I had &s;een the Tower, or St. Paul's church? and, upon an&s;wering in the negative, they propo&s;ed making a party to &s;hew them to me. Among other que&s;tions, they al&s;o a&s;ked if I had ever &s;een <HI>&s;uch a thing as an Opera?</HI> I told them I had. <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;aw one in my life, &s;o long as I've lived in London, and I never de&s;ire to &s;ee one, if I live here as much longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"why not? you might as well for once, for the curio&s;ity of the thing: be&s;ides, Mi&s;s Pomfret &s;aw one, and &s;he &s;ays it was very pretty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s will think us very vulgar,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"to live in London, and never have been to an Opera; but it's no fault of mine, I a&s;|&s;ure you, Mi&s;s, only Papa don't like to go."</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;ult was, that a party was propo&s;ed, and agreed to, for &s;ome early opportunity. I did not dare oppo&s;e them; but I &s;aid that my time, while
<PB N="89" REF="104">
I remained in town, was at the di&s;po&s;al of Mrs. Mirvan. However, I am &s;ure I will not attend them, if I can po&s;&s;ibly avoid &s;o doing.</P>
<P>When we parted, Madame Duval de&s;ired to &s;ee me the next day; and the Branghtons told me, that the fir&s;t time I went towards Snow Hill, they &s;hould be very glad if I would call upon them.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h we may not meet again till that time ar|rives.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I &s;hall not be very ambitious of being known to any more of my relations, if they have any re&s;emblance to tho&s;e who&s;e acquaintance I have been introduced to already.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>

<P>I Had ju&s;t fini&s;hed my letter to you this morning, when a violent rapping at the door made me run down &s;tairs; and who &s;hould I &s;ee in the draw|ing room, but Lord Orville!</P>
<P>He was quite alone, for the family had not a&s;|&s;embled to breakfa&s;t. He enquired, fir&s;t of mine, then of the health of Mrs. and Mi&s;s Mirvan, with a degree of concern that rather &s;urpri&s;ed me, till he &s;aid that he had ju&s;t been informed of the accident we had met with at Ranelagh. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow upon the occa&s;ion with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s, and lamented that he had not been &s;o fortunate as to hear of it in time to offer his &s;ervices. <Q REND="inline">"But, I think,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby had the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was with Captain Mirvan, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had heard of his being of your party."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="105">
I hope that flighty man has not been telling Lord Orville he only a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>me?</HI> however, he did not pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, but &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This accident, though extremely unfortunate, will not, I hope, be the means of frightening you from gracing Ra|nelagh with your pre&s;ence in future?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our time, my Lord, for London is almo&s;t expired already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed! do you leave town &s;o very &s;oon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, my Lord, our &s;tay has already exceed|ed our intentions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you, then, &s;o particularly partial to the country?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We merely came to town, my Lord, to meet Captain Mirvan."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And does Mi&s;s Anville feel no concern at the idea of the many mourners her ab&s;ence will occa|&s;ion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, my Lord,&mdash;I'm &s;ure you don't think&mdash;"</Q> I &s;topt there, for, indeed, I hardly knew what I was going to &s;ay. My fooli&s;h embarra&s;&s;ment, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the cau&s;e of what followed;&mdash;for he came to me, and took my hand, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>do</HI> think, that whoever has once &s;een Mi&s;s Anville, mu&s;t re|ceive an impre&s;&s;ion never to be forgotten."</Q></P>
<P>This compliment,&mdash;from Lord Orville,&mdash;&s;o &s;ur|pri&s;ed me, that I could not &s;peak; but felt my&s;elf change colour, and &s;tood, for &s;ome moments, &s;i|lent and looking down: however, the in&s;tant I re|collected my &s;ituation, I withdrew my hand, and told him that I would &s;ee if Mrs. Mirvan was not dre&s;&s;ed. He did not oppo&s;e me, &s;o away I went.</P>
<P>I met them all on the &s;tairs, and returned with them to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince been extremely angry with my&s;elf for neglecting &s;o excellent an opportunity of apo|logizing
<PB N="91" REF="106">
for my behaviour at the Ridotto: but, to own the truth, that affair never once occurred to me during the &s;hort <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> which we had to|gether. But, if, ever we &s;hould happen to be &s;o &s;ituated again, I will certainly mention it; for I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly concerned at the thought of his harbouring an opinion that I am bold or imperti|nent, and I could almo&s;t kill my&s;elf for having given him the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for &s;o &s;hocking an idea.</P>
<P>But was it not very odd, that he &s;hould make me &s;uch a compliment? I expected it not from him;&mdash;but gallantry, I believe, is common to all men, whatever other qualities they may have in particular.</P>
<P>Our breakfa&s;t was the mo&s;t agreeable meal, if it may be called a <HI>meal,</HI> that we have had &s;ince we came to town. Indeed, but for Madame Du|val I &s;hould like London extremely.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of Lord Orville is really de|lightful. His manners are &s;o elegant, &s;o gentle, &s;o una&s;&s;uming, that they at once engage e&s;teem, and diffu&s;e complacence. Far from being indolently &s;atisfied with his own accompli&s;hments, as I have already ob&s;erved many men here are, though with|out any preten&s;ions to his merit, he is mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly attentive to plea&s;e and to &s;erve all who are in his company; and, though his &s;ucce&s;s is inva|riable, he never manife&s;ts the &s;malle&s;t degree of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that <HI>you,</HI> my deare&s;t Sir, knew Lord Orville, becau&s;e I am &s;ure you would love him; and I have felt that wi&s;h for no other per&s;on I have &s;een &s;ince I came to London. I &s;ometimes imagine, that, when his youth is flown, his viva|city abated, and his life is devoted to retirement, he will, perhaps, re&s;emble him whom I mo&s;t love
<PB N="92" REF="107">
and honour. His pre&s;ent &s;weetne&s;s, politene&s;s, and diffidence, &s;eem to promi&s;e in future the &s;ame be|nevolence, dignity, and goodne&s;s. But I mu&s;t not expatiate upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When Lord Orville was gone,&mdash;and he made but a very &s;hort vi&s;it,&mdash;I was preparing, mo&s;t re|luctantly, to wait upon Madame Duval; but Mrs. Mirvan propo&s;ed to the Captain, that &s;he &s;hould be invited to dinner in Queen-Ann-Street, and he readily con&s;ented, for he &s;aid he wi&s;hed to a&s;k after her Lyons negligee.</P>
<P>The invitation is accepted, and we expect her every moment. But to me, it is very &s;trange, that a woman, who is the uncontrolled mi&s;tre&s;s of her time, fortune, and actions, &s;hould chu&s;e to ex|po&s;e her&s;elf voluntarily to the rudene&s;s of a man who is openly determined to make her his &s;port. But &s;he has very few acquaintance, and, I fancy, &s;carce knows how to employ her&s;elf.</P>
<P>How great is my obligation to Mrs. Mirvan, for be&s;towing her time in a manner &s;o di&s;agree|able to her&s;elf, merely to promote my happine&s;s! every di&s;pute in which her unde&s;erving hu&s;band engages, is productive of pain, and unea&s;ine&s; s to her&s;elf; of this I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that I even be|&s;ought her not to &s;end to Madame Duval, but &s;he declared &s;he could not bear to have me pa&s;s all my time, while in town, with her only. Indeed &s;he is &s;o infinitely kind to me, that one would think &s;he was your daughter.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday Morning, April 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MADAME Duval was accompanied by Mon&s;ieur Du Bois. I am &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e to introduce him where he is &s;o unwelcome; and, indeed, it is &s;trange that they &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tantly together: though I believe I &s;hould not have taken notice of it, but that Captain Mirvan is perpetually rallying me upon my <HI>grandmama's beau.</HI></P>
<P>They were both received by Mrs. Mirvan with her u&s;ual good-breeding; but the Captain, mo&s;t provokingly, attacked her immediately, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Madam, you that have lived abroad, plea&s;e to tell me this here; Which did you like be&s;t, the <HI>warm room</HI> at Ranelagh, or the <HI>cold bath</HI> you went into afterwards? though, I a&s;&s;ure you, you look &s;o well that I &s;hould advi&s;e you to take another dip."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"nobody a&s;ked for your advice, &s;o you may as well keep it to your|&s;elf: be&s;ides, it's no great joke to be &s;pla&s;hed, and to catch cold, and &s;poil all one's things, whatever you may think of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Spla&s;hed,</HI> quoth-a!&mdash;why I thought you were &s;ou&s;ed all over.&mdash;Come, come, don't mince the matter, never &s;poil a good &s;tory; you know you had n't a dry thread about you&mdash;'Fore George, I &s;hall never think on't without hallooing! &s;uch a poor, forlorn, draggle-tailed&mdash;<HI>gentlewoman!</HI> and poor Mon&s;ieur French, here, like a drowned rat, by your &s;ide!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="109">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, the wor&s;e pickle we was in, &s;o much the wor&s;er in you not to help us, for you knowed where we was fa&s;t enough, becau&s;e, while I laid in the mud, I'm pretty &s;ure I heard you &s;nigger; &s;o it's like enough you jo&s;tled us down your&s;elf, for Mon&s;ieur Du Bois &s;ays, that he is &s;ure he had a great jolt given him, or he &s;hould n't have fell."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain laughed &s;o immoderately, that he really gave me al&s;o a &s;u&s;picion that he was not entirely innocent of the charge: however, he di&s;|claimed it very peremptorily.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if you did n't do that, why did n't you come to help us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who, I?&mdash;what, do you &s;uppo&s;e I had forgot I was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> a filthy, bea&s;tly <HI>Engli&s;hman?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very well, Sir, very well; but I was a fool to expect any better, for it's all of a piece with the re&s;t; you know you wanted to fling me out of the coach-window, the very fir&s;t time ever I &s;ee you: but I'll never go to Ranelagh with you no more, that I'm re&s;olved; for I dare &s;ay, if the hor&s;es had runn'd over me, as I laid in that na&s;|tine&s;s, you'd never have &s;tirred a &s;tep to &s;ave me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, no, to be &s;ure, Ma'am, not for the world! I know your opinion of our nation too well, to affront you by &s;uppo&s;ing a <HI>Frenchman</HI> would want <HI>my</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance to protect you. Did you think that Mon&s;ieur here, and I, had changed characters, and that he &s;hould pop you into the mud, and I help you out of it? Ha, ha, ha!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, very well, Sir, laugh on, it's like your manners; however, if poor Mon&s;ieur Du Bois had n't met with that unlucky accident him&s;elf, I &s;hould n't have wanted nobody's help."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I promi&s;e you, Madam, you'd never have had mine; I knew my di&s;tance better;
<PB N="95" REF="110">
and as to your being a little ducked, or &s;o, why, to be &s;ure, Mon&s;ieur and you &s;ettled that be|tween your&s;elves; &s;o it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, I &s;uppo&s;e, you want to make me believe as Mon&s;ieur Du Bois &s;erved me that trick o' purpo&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O' purpo&s;e! ay, certainly, who ever doubt|ed that? Do you think a <HI>Frenchman</HI> ever made a blunder? If he had been &s;ome clum&s;y-footed <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fellow, indeed, it might have been acci|dental: but what the devil &s;ignifies all your hop|ping and capering with your dancing-ma&s;ters, if you can't balance your&s;elves upright?"</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this dialogue, Sir Clement Willoughby made his appearance. He affects to enter the hou&s;e with the freedom of an old ac|quaintance, and this very <HI>ea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> which, to me, is a&s;toni&s;hing, is what mo&s;t particularly recom|mends him to the Captain. Indeed, he &s;eems very &s;ucce&s;sfully to &s;tudy all the humours of that gentleman.</P>
<P>After having heartily welcomed him, <Q REND="inline">"You are ju&s;t come in time, my boy,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ettle a little matter of a di&s;pute between this here gentlewoman and I; do you know, &s;he has been trying to per&s;uade me, that &s;he did not above half like the ducking Mon&s;ieur gave her t'other night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have hoped,"</Q> (&s;aid Sir Clement, with the utmo&s;t gravity) <Q REND="inline">"that the friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between that lady and gentleman, would have guarded them again&s;t any actions profe&s;&s;edly di&s;agreeable to each other; but, probably, they might not have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the matter previou&s;ly; in which ca&s;e, the gentleman, I mu&s;t own, &s;eems to have been guilty of inattention, &s;ince, in my
<PB N="96" REF="111">
humble opinion, it was his bu&s;ine&s;s fir&s;t to have enquired whether the lady preferred &s;oft, or hard ground, before he dropt her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O very fine, Gentlemen, very fine,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"you may try to &s;et us together by the ears as much as you will; but I'm not &s;uch an ignorant per&s;on as to be made a fool of &s;o ea&s;i|ly; &s;o you need n't talk no more about it, for I &s;ees into your de&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, who was ju&s;t able to di&s;co|ver the &s;ubject upon which the conver&s;ation turn|ed, made his defence, in French, with great &s;o|lemnity; he hoped, he &s;aid, that the company would at lea&s;t acknowledge, he did not come from a nation of brutes, and con&s;equently, that to wil|fully offend any lady, was, to him, utterly impo&s;&s;i|ble; but that, on the contrary, in endeavouring, as was his duty, to &s;ave and guard her, he had him&s;elf &s;uffered, in a manner which he would for|bear to relate, but which, he greatly apprehended, he &s;hould feel the ill effects of for many months; and then, with a countenance exceedingly length|ened, he added, that he hoped it would not be attributed to him as national prejudice, when he owned that he mu&s;t, to the be&s;t of his memory, aver, that his unfortunate fall was owing to a &s;ud|den, but violent pu&s;h, which, he was &s;hocked to &s;ay, &s;ome malevolent per&s;on, with a de&s;ign to his injury, mu&s;t certainly have given him; but whe|ther with a view to mortify him, by making him let the lady fall, or whether merely to &s;poil his clothes, he could not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>This di&s;putation was, at la&s;t, concluded by Mrs. Mirvan propo&s;ing that we &s;hould all go to Cox's Mu&s;eum. Nobody objected, and carriages were immediately ordered.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="112">
In our way down &s;tairs, Madame Duval in a very pa&s;&s;ionate manner, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> if I would n't give fifty guineas, only to know who gave us that &s;hove!"</Q></P>
<P>This Mu&s;eum is very a&s;toni&s;hing, and very &s;uperb; yet, it afforded me but little plea&s;ure, for it is a mere &s;how, though a wonderful one.</P>
<P>Sir Clement Willoughby, in our walk round the room, a&s;ked me what my opinion was of this brilliant <HI>&s;pectacle.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is very fine and very ingenious,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"and yet&mdash;I don't know how it is,&mdash;but I &s;eem to mi&s;s &s;omething."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Excellently an&s;wered!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you have exactly defined my own feelings, though in a man|ner I &s;hould never have arrived at. But I was certain your ta&s;te was too well formed, to be plea&s;ed at the expence of your under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you two is difficult enough! I'm &s;ure if you don't like this, you like nothing; for it's the grande&s;t, prettie&s;t, fine&s;t &s;ight that ever I &s;ee, in England."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> (cried the Captain, with a &s;neer) <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e this may be in your French ta&s;te? it's like enough, for it's all <HI>kick&s;haw</HI> work. But, pry'thee, friend,"</Q> (turning to the per&s;on who ex|plained the devices) <Q REND="inline">"will you tell me the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of all this? for I'm not enough of a conjurer to find it out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"U&s;e, indeed!"</Q> (repeated Madame Duval di&s;|dainfully) <Q REND="inline">"Lord, if every thing's to be u&s;eful!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as to that, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid our con|ductor, <Q REND="inline">"the ingenuity of the mechani&s;m,&mdash;the beauty of the workman&s;hip,&mdash;the&mdash;undoubt|edly, Sir, any per&s;on of ta&s;te may ea&s;ily di&s;cern the utility of &s;uch extraordinary performances."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="113">
<Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"your per&s;on of ta&s;te mu&s;t be either a coxcomb, or a Frenchman; though, for the matter of that, 'tis the &s;ame thing."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, our attention was attracted by a pine|apple, which, &s;uddenly opening, di&s;covered a ne&s;t of birds, who immediately began to &s;ing. <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"this is prettier than all the re&s;t! I declare, in all my travels, I never &s;ee nothing eleganter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hark ye, friend,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"ha&s;t never another pine-apple?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, if thou ha&s;t, pry'thee give it us without the birds; for, d'ye &s;ee, I'm no French|man, and &s;hould reli&s;h &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tan|tial."</Q></P>
<P>This entertainment concluded with a concert of mechanical mu&s;ic: I cannot explain how it was produced, but the effect was plea&s;ing. Ma|dame Duval was in extacies; and the Captain flung him&s;elf into &s;o many ridiculous di&s;tortions, by way of mimicking her, that he engaged the attention of all the company; and, in the mid&s;t of the performance of the Coronation Anthem, while Madame Duval was affecting to beat time, and uttering many expre&s;&s;ions of delight, he called &s;uddenly for &s;alts, which a lady, apprehending &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, politely handed to him, and which, in&s;tantly applying to the no&s;trils of poor Madame Duval, &s;he involuntarily &s;nuffed up &s;uch a quantity, that the pain and &s;urpri&s;e made her &s;cream aloud. When &s;he recovered, &s;he reproached him, with her u&s;ual vehemence; but he prote&s;ted he had taken that mea&s;ure out of pure friend&s;hip, as he concluded, from her raptures, that &s;he was going
<PB N="99" REF="114">
into hy&s;terics. This excu&s;e by no means appea&s;ed her, and they had a violent quarrel; but the only effect her anger had on the Captain, was to encrea&s;e his diver&s;ion. Indeed, he laughs and talks &s;o terribly loud in public, that he frequently makes us a&s;hamed of belonging to him.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, notwith&s;tanding her wrath, made no &s;cruple of returning to dine in Queen-Ann-&s;treet. Mrs. Mirvan had &s;ecured places for the play at Drury Lane Theatre, and, though ever unea&s;y in her company, &s;he very politely invited Madame Duval to be of our party; however, &s;he had a bad cold, and cho&s;e to nur&s;e it. I was &s;orry for her indi&s;po&s;ition, but I knew not how to be &s;orry &s;he did not accompany us, for &s;he is&mdash;I mu&s;t not &s;ay what, but very unlike other people.</P>

<P>OUR places were in the front row of a &s;ide|box. Sir Clement Willoughby, who knew our intention, was at the door of the Theatre, and handed us from the carriage.</P>
<P>We had not been &s;eated five minutes, ere Lord Orville, who we &s;aw in the &s;tage-box, came to us; and he honoured us with his company all the evening. Mi&s;s Mirvan and I both rejoiced that Madame Duval was ab&s;ent, as we hoped for the enjoyment of &s;ome conver&s;ation, uninterrupted by her quarrels with the Captain: but I &s;oon
<PB N="100" REF="115">
found that her pre&s;ence would have made very little alteration, for &s;o far was I from daring to &s;peak, that I knew not where even to look.</P>
<P>The play was Love for Love, and though it is fraught with wit and entertainment, I hope I &s;hall never &s;ee it repre&s;ented again; for it is &s;o ex|tremely indelicate,&mdash;to u&s;e the &s;ofte&s;t word I can,&mdash;that Mi&s;s Mirvan and I were perpetually out of countenance, and could neither make any ob|&s;ervations our&s;elves, nor venture to li&s;ten to tho&s;e of others. This was the more provoking, as Lord Orville was in excellent &s;pirits, and exceedingly entertaining.</P>
<P>When the Play was over, I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould be able to look about me with le&s;s re&s;traint, as we intended to &s;tay the Farce; but the curtain had hardly dropped when the box-door opened, and in came Mr. Lovel, the man by who&s;e fop|pery and impertinence I was &s;o much teazed at the ball where I fir&s;t &s;aw Lord Orville.</P>
<P>I turned away my head, and began talking to Mi&s;s Mirvan, for I was de&s;irous to avoid &s;peak|ing to him!&mdash;but in vain, for as &s;oon as he had made his compliments to Lord Orville and Sir Clement Willoughby, who returned them very coldly, he bent his head forward, and &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, Ma'am, you have enjoyed your health &s;ince I had the honour&mdash;I beg ten thou|&s;and pardons, but I prote&s;t I was going to &s;ay the honour of <HI>dancing</HI> with you&mdash;however, I mean the honour of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> you dance?"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;poke with a &s;elf-complacency that con|vinced me he had &s;tudied this addre&s;s, by way of making repri&s;als for my conduct at the ball: I therefore bowed &s;lightly, but made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="116">
After a &s;hort &s;ilence, he again called my atten|tion, by &s;aying, in an ea&s;y, negligent way, <Q REND="inline">"I think, Ma'am, you was never in town before?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I did pre&s;ume. Doubtle&s;s, Ma'am, every thing mu&s;t be infinitely novel to you. Our cu&s;|toms, our manners, and <HI>les etiquettes de nous autres,</HI> can have very little re&s;emblance to tho&s;e you have been u&s;ed to. I imagine, Ma'am, your retirement is at no very &s;mall di&s;tance from the capital?"</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;o much di&s;concerted at this &s;neering &s;peech, that I &s;aid not a word; though I have &s;ince thought my vexation both &s;timulated and de|lighted him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The air we breathe here, however, Ma'am,</Q> (continued he, very conceitedly) <Q REND="inline">"though foreign to that you have been accu&s;tomed to, has not, I hope, been at variance with your health?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"could not your <HI>eye</HI> have &s;pared that que&s;tion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"if <HI>health</HI> were the only cau&s;e of a lady's bloom, my eye, I grant, had been infallible from the fir&s;t glance; but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> cried Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg no in&s;inuations of that &s;ort; Mi&s;s An|ville's colour, as you have &s;ucce&s;sfully tried, may, you &s;ee, be heightened;&mdash;but I a&s;&s;ure you, it would be pa&s;t your &s;kill to le&s;&s;en it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Pon honour, Madam,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"you wrong me; I pre&s;umed not to infer that <HI>rouge</HI> was the only &s;uccedaneum for health; but, really, I have known &s;o many different cau&s;es for a lady's colour, &s;uch as flu&s;hing,&mdash;anger,&mdash;<HI>mauvai&s;e honte,</HI>&mdash;and &s;o forth, that I never dare decide to which it may be owing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="117">
<Q REND="inline">"As to &s;uch cau&s;es as them there,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"they mu&s;t belong to tho&s;e that they keep company with."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very true, Captain,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement; <Q REND="inline">"the natural complexion has nothing to do with occa&s;ional &s;allies of the pa&s;&s;ions, or any accidental cau&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, truly,"</Q> returned the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"for now here's me, why I look like any other man ju&s;t now; and yet, if you were to put me in a pa&s;&s;ion, 'fore George, you'd &s;oon &s;ee me have as fine a high colour as any painted Jezebel in all this place, be &s;he never &s;o bedaubed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"the difference of natural and of artificial colour, &s;eems to me very ea&s;ily di&s;cerned; that of Nature, is mottled, and varying; that of art, <HI>&s;et,</HI> and <HI>too</HI> &s;mooth; it wants that animation, that glow, that <HI>inde&s;cribable &s;omething</HI> which, even now that I &s;ee it, wholly &s;urpa&s;&s;es all my powers of expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be a <HI>connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> in beauty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And you, Sir Clement,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am proud to own it,"</Q> cried Sir Clement; <Q REND="inline">"in &s;uch a cau&s;e, and before &s;uch objects, en|thu&s;ia&s;m is &s;imply the con&s;equence of not being blind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pr'ythee a truce with all this palavering,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"the women are vain enough already; no need for to puff 'em up more."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t all &s;ubmit to the commanding offi|cer,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"therefore let us call ano|ther &s;ubject. Pray, Ladies, how have you been entertained with the play?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="118">
<Q REND="inline">"Want of entertainment,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"is its lea&s;t fault; but I own there are objections to it, which I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee removed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could have ventured to an&s;wer for the Ladies,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I am &s;ure this is not a play that can be honoured with their approbation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, I &s;uppo&s;e it is not &s;entimental enough!"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"or el&s;e it's too good for them; for I'll maintain it's one of the be&s;t come|dies in the language, and has more wit in one &s;cene, than there is in all the new plays put toge|ther."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For my part,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s I &s;eldom li&s;ten to the players: one has &s;o much to do, in looking about, and finding out one's ac|quaintance, that, really, one has no time to mind the &s;tage. Pray,&mdash;(mo&s;t affectedly fixing his eyes upon a diamond-ring on his little finger) pray&mdash;what was the play to-night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what the D&mdash;l,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"do you come to the play, without knowing what it is?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, Sir, yes, very frequently; I have no time to read play-bills; one merely comes to meet one's friends; and &s;hew that one's alive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;and &s;o,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"it co&s;ts you five &s;hillings a night, ju&s;t to &s;hew that you're alive! Well, faith, my friends &s;hould all think me dead and under ground, before I'd be at the expence for 'em. How&s;omever, this here you may take from me;&mdash;they'll find you out fa&s;t enough, if you've any thing to give 'em. And &s;o you've been here all this time, and don't know what the play was?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="119">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, really, Sir, a play requires &s;o much attention,&mdash;it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to keep awake, if one li&s;tens;&mdash;for, indeed, by the time it is even|ing, one has been &s;o fatigued, with dining,&mdash;or wine,&mdash;or the hou&s;e,&mdash;or &s;tudying,&mdash;that it is&mdash;it is perfectly an impo&s;&s;ibility. But, now I think of it, I believe I have a bill in my pocket; O, ay, here it is&mdash;Love for Love, ay,&mdash;true,&mdash;ha, ha,&mdash;how could I be &s;o &s;tupid!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, ea&s;ily enough as to that, I warrant you,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"but, by my &s;oul, this is one of the be&s;t jokes I ever heard! Come to a play, and not know what it is!&mdash;Why, I &s;uppo&s;e you would n't have found it out, if they had <HI>fob'd</HI> you off with a &s;craping of fidlers, or an opera?&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;why now, I &s;hould have thought you might have taken &s;ome notice of one Mr. <HI>Tattle</HI> that is in this play?</Q></P>
<P>This &s;arca&s;m, which cau&s;ed a general &s;mile, made him colour: but, turning to the Captain with a look of conceit, which implied that he had a retort ready, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, give me leave to a&s;k,&mdash;what do <HI>you</HI> think of <HI>one Mr. Ben,</HI> who is al&s;o in this play?</Q></P>
<P>The Captain, regarding him with the utmo&s;t contempt, an&s;wered in a loud voice, <Q REND="inline">"Think of him!&mdash;why I think he's a <HI>man!</HI>"</Q> And then, &s;taring full in his face, he &s;truck his cane on the ground, with a violence that made him &s;tart. He did not, however, chu&s;e to take any notice of this; but, having bit his nails &s;ome time, in manife&s;t confu&s;ion, he turned very quick to me, and, in a &s;neering tone of voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"For my part, I was mo&s;t &s;truck with the <HI>country</HI> young lady, Mi&s;s Prue; pray what do <HI>you</HI> think of her, Ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="120">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> cried I, very much provoked, <Q REND="inline">"I think&mdash;that is, I do not think any thing about her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, really, Ma'am, you prodigiou&s;ly &s;ur|prize me!&mdash;<HI>mais, apparemment ce n'e&s;t qu'un fa&ccedil;on &agrave; parler?</HI>&mdash;though I &s;hould beg your pardon, for probably you do not under&s;tand French?"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer, for I thought his rudene&s;s intolerable; but Sir Clement, with great warmth, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you can &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an object as Mi&s;s Prue would engage the attention of Mi&s;s Anville even for a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, Sir,"</Q> returned this fop, <Q REND="inline">'tis the fir&s;t character in the piece!&mdash;&s;o well drawn,&mdash;&s;o much the thing!&mdash;&s;uch true country-breeding,&mdash;&s;uch rural ignorance!&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;'tis mo&s;t ad|mirably hit off, 'pon honour!"</Q></P>
<P>I could almo&s;t have cried, that &s;uch imperti|nence &s;hould be levelled at me; and yet, chagri|ned as I was, I could never behold Lord Orville and this man at the &s;ame time, and feel any regret for the cau&s;e I had given of di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The only character in the play,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"worthy of being mentioned to the&s;e ladies is Angelica."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Angelica,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"is a noble girl; &s;he tries her lover &s;everely, but &s;he rewards him generou&s;ly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet, in a trial &s;o long,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"there &s;eems rather too much con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her power."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Since my opinion has the &s;anction of Mrs. Mirvan's,"</Q> added Lord Orville," <Q REND="inline">"I will venture to &s;ay, that Angelica be&s;tows her hand rather with the air of a benefactre&s;s, than with the ten|terne&s;s of a mi&s;tre&s;s. Genero&s;ity without delicacy,
<PB N="106" REF="121">
like wit without judgment, generally gives as much pain as plea&s;ure. The uncertainty in which &s;he keeps Valentine, and her manner of trifling with his temper, give no very favourable idea of her own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"it mu&s;t, however, be owned, that uncertainty is not the <HI>ton</HI> among our ladies at pre&s;ent; nay, indeed, I think they &s;ay, though, faith,"</Q> taking a pinch of &s;nuff, <Q REND="inline">"I hope it is not true&mdash;but they &s;ay, that <HI>we</HI> now are mo&s;t &s;hy and backward."</Q></P>
<P>The curtain then drew up, and our conver&s;a|tion cea&s;ed. Mr. Lovel finding we cho&s;e to attend to the players, le&s;t the box. How &s;trange it is, Sir, that this man, not contented with the large &s;hare of foppery and non&s;en&s;e which he has from nature, &s;hould think proper to affect yet more! for what he faid of Tattle and of Mi&s;s Prue, con|vinced me that he really had li&s;tened to the play, though he was &s;o ridiculous and fooli&s;h as to pre|tend ignorance.</P>
<P>But how malicicious and impertinent in this creature to talk to me in &s;uch a manner! I am &s;ure I hope I &s;hall never &s;ee him again. I &s;hould have de&s;pi&s;ed him heartily as a fop, had he never &s;poken to me at at all; but now, that he thinks proper to re&s;ent his &s;uppo&s;ed ill u&s;age, I am really quite afraid of him.</P>
<P>The entertainment was, The Deuce is in him, which Lord Orville ob&s;erved to be the mo&s;t fini&s;h|ed and elegant <HI>petite piece</HI> that was ever written in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In our way home, Mrs. Mirvan put me into &s;ome con&s;ternation, by &s;aying it was evident, from the re&s;entment which this Mr. Lovel harbours of my conduct, that he would think it a provocation
<PB N="107" REF="122">
&s;ufficiently important for a duel, if his courage equalled his wrath.</P>
<P>I am terrified at the very idea. Good Heaven! that a man &s;o weak and frivolous &s;hould be &s;o re|vengeful! However! if bravery would have exci|ted him to affront Lord Orville, how much rea|&s;on have I to rejoice, that cowardice makes him contented with venting his &s;pleen upon me! But we &s;hall leave town &s;oon, and, I hope, &s;ee him no more.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome con&s;olation to me, to hear, from Mi&s;s Mirvan, that, while he was &s;peaking to me &s;o cavalierly, Lord Orville regarded him with great indignation.</P>
<P>But, really, I think there ought to be a book, of the laws and cu&s;toms <HI>a-la-mode,</HI> pre&s;ented to all young people, upon their fir&s;t introduction into public company.</P>
<P>To night we go to the opera, where I expect very great plea&s;ure. We &s;hall have the &s;ame party as at the play; for Lord Orville &s;aid he &s;hould be there, and would look for us.</P>

They advanced to me with great familiarity, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"How do you do, cou|&s;in?&mdash;&s;o we've caught you at the gla&s;s!&mdash;well, I'm determined I'll tell my brother of that!"</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mirvan, who had never before &s;een them, and could not, at fir&s;t, imagine who they were, looked &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, that I was ready to laugh my&s;elf, till the elde&s;t &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We're come to take you to the opera, Mi&s;s; papa and my brother are below, and we are to call for your grand-mama as we go along."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"that you &s;hould have taken &s;o much trouble, as I am enga|ged already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Engaged! Lord, Mi&s;s, never mind that,"</Q> cried the younge&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"this young lady will make your excu&s;es, I dare &s;ay; it's only doing as one would be done by, you know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall my&s;elf be very &s;orry to be deprived of Mi&s;s Anville's company this evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Mi&s;s, that is not &s;o very good-natured in you,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"con&s;idering we only come to give our cou&s;in plea&s;ure; it's no good to us; it's all upon her account; for we came, I don't know how much round about to take her up."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am extremely obliged to you,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"and very &s;orry you have lo&s;t &s;o much time; but I cannot po&s;&s;ibly help it, for I engaged my&s;elf with|out knowing you would call."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="124">
<Q REND="inline">"Lord, what &s;ignifies that?"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"you're no old maid, and &s;o you need n't be &s;o very formal: be&s;ides, I dare &s;ay tho&s;e you are engaged to, a'n't half &s;o near related to you as we are."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg you not to pre&s;s me any further, for I a&s;&s;ure you it is not in my power to attend you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why we came all out of the city on purpo&s;e: be&s;ides, your grand-mama expects you;&mdash;and, pray, what are we to &s;ay to her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell her, if you plea&s;e, that I am much con|cerned,&mdash;but that I am pre-engaged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And who to?"</Q> demanded the abrupt Mi&s;s Branghton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Mrs. Mirvan,&mdash;and a large party."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, pray, what are you all going to do, that it would be &s;uch a mighty matter for you to come along with us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We are going to&mdash;to the opera."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear, if that be all, why can't we go all together?"</Q></P>
<P>I was extremely di&s;concerted at this forward and ignorant behaviour, and yet their rudene&s;s very much le&s;&s;ened my concern at refu&s;ing them. Indeed, their dre&s;s was &s;uch as would have rendered their &s;cheme of accompanying our party impracticable, even if I had de&s;ired it; and this, as they did not them|&s;elves find out, I was obliged, in terms the lea&s;t mortifying I could think of, to tell them.</P>
<P>They were very much chagrined, and a&s;ked where I &s;hould &s;it?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In the pit,"</Q> an&s;wered I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In the pit!"</Q> repeated Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"well, really, I mu&s;t own I &s;hould never have &s;uppo&s;ed that my gown was not good enough for the pit: but come, Polly, let's go; if Mi&s;s does not think
<PB N="110" REF="125">
us fine enough for her, why to be &s;ure &s;he may chu&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at this ignorance, I would have ex|plained to them that the pit at the opera required the &s;ame dre&s;s as the boxes; but they were &s;o much affronted, they would not hear me, and, in great di&s;|plea&s;ure, left the room, &s;aying they would not have troubled me, only they thought I &s;hould not be &s;o proud with my own relations, and that they had at lea&s;t as good a right to my company as &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to apologize, and would have &s;ent a long me&s;&s;age to Madame Duval; but they ha&s;|tened away without li&s;tening to me; and I could not follow them down &s;tairs, becau&s;e I was not dre&s;&s;ed. The la&s;t words I heard them &s;ay, were, <Q REND="inline">"Well, her grand-mama will be in a fine pa&s;&s;ion, that's one good thing."</Q></P>
<P>Though I was extremely mad at this vi&s;it, yet I &s;o heartily rejoiced at their going, that I would not &s;uffer my&s;elf to think gravely about it.</P>
<P>Soon after, Sir Clement actually came, and we all went down &s;tairs. Mrs. Mirvan ordered tea; and we were engaged in a very lively conver&s;ation, when the &s;ervant announced Madame Duval, who in|&s;tantly followed him into the room.</P>
<P>Her face was the colour of &s;carlet, and her eyes &s;parkled with fury. She came up to me with a ha&s;ty &s;tep, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"So, Mi&s;s, you refu&s;es to come to me, do you? And pray who are you, to dare to di&s;obey me?"</Q></P>
<P>I was quite frightened;&mdash;I made no an&s;wer;&mdash;I even attempted to ri&s;e, and could not, but &s;at &s;till, mute and motionle&s;s.</P>
<P>Every body, but Mi&s;s Mirvan, &s;eemed in the ut|mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment; and the Captain, rai&s;ing and approaching Madame Duval, with a voice of au|thority,
<PB N="111" REF="126">
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why how now, Mrs. Turkey Cock, what's put you into this here flu&s;ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's nothing to you,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o you may as well hold your tongue, for I &s;ha'n't be called to no account by you, I a&s;&s;ure you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There you're out, Madam Fury,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"for you mu&s;t know I never &s;uffer any body to be in a pa&s;&s;ion in my hou&s;e, but my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you <HI>&s;hall,</HI>"</Q> cried &s;he, in a great rage, <Q REND="inline">"for I'll be in as great a pa&s;&s;ion as ever I plea&s;e, without a&s;king your leave, &s;o don't give your&s;elf no more airs about it. And as for you, Mi&s;s,"</Q> again advancing to me <Q REND="inline">"I order you to follow me this moment, or el&s;e I'll make you repent it all your life."</Q> And, with the&s;e words, &s;he flung out of the room.</P>
<P>I was in &s;uch extreme terror at being addre&s;&s;ed and threatened in a manner to which I am &s;o wholly unu&s;ed, that I almo&s;t thought I &s;hould have fainted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't be alarmed, my love,"</Q> cried Mrs. Mir|van, <Q REND="inline">"but &s;tay where you are, and I will follow Madame Duval, and try to bring her to rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mirvan took my hand, and mo&s;t kindly endeavoured to rai&s;e my &s;pirits: Sir Clement, too, approached me, with an air &s;o intere&s;ted in my di&s;|tre&s;s, that I could not but feel my&s;elf obliged to him; and, taking my other hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, my dear Madam, compo&s;e your|&s;elf; &s;urely the violence of &s;uch a wretch ought merely to move your contempt: &s;he can have no right, I imagine, to lay her commands upon you, and I only wi&s;h that you would allow <HI>me</HI> leave to &s;peak to her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! not for the world! indeed, I believe,&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;I had better follow her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Follow her! Good God, my dear Mi&s;s An|ville, would you tru&s;t your&s;elf with a mad woman?
<PB N="112" REF="127">
for what el&s;e can you call a creature who&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions are &s;o in&s;olent? No, no; &s;end her word at once to leave the hou&s;e, and tell her you de&s;ire that &s;he will never &s;ee you again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir! you don't know who you talk of!&mdash;it would ill become me to &s;end Madame Duval &s;uch a me&s;&s;age."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But <HI>why,</HI>"</Q> cried he, (looking very inqui&s;itive,) <Q REND="inline">"<HI>why</HI> &s;hould you &s;cruple to treat her as &s;he de|&s;erves?"</Q></P>
<P>I then found that his aim was to di&s;cover the nature of her connection with me; but I felt &s;o much a&s;hamed of my near relation&s;hip to her, that I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf to an&s;wer him, and only entreated that he would leave her to Mrs. Mirvan, who ju&s;t then entered.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could &s;peak to me, the Captain called out, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Goody, what have you done with Madame French? is &s;he cooled a little? 'cau&s;e, if &s;he be n't, I've ju&s;t thought of a mo&s;t excellent device to bring her to."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Evelina,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"I have been vainly endeavouring to appea&s;e her; I pleaded your engagement, and promi&s;ed your fu|ture attendance: but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, my love, that I fear her rage will end in a total breach (which I think you had better avoid) if &s;he is any further oppo&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I will go to her, Madam,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"and, indeed, it is now no matter, for I &s;hould not be able to recover my &s;pirits &s;ufficiently to enjoy much plea&s;ure <HI>any</HI> where this evening."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement began a very warm expo&s;tulation, and entreaty, that I would not go; but I begged him to de&s;i&s;t, and told him, very hone&s;tly, that, if my compliance were not indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="113" REF="128">
I &s;hould require no per&s;ua&s;ion to &s;tay. He then took my hand, to lead me down &s;tairs; but the Captain de&s;ired him to be quiet, &s;aying he would '&s;quire me him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e,"</Q> he added exult|ingly rubbing his hands,) <Q REND="inline">"I have a wipe ready for the old lady, which may &s;erve her to <HI>chew</HI> as &s;he goes along."</Q></P>
<P>We found her in the parlour. <Q REND="inline">"O, you're come at la&s;t, Mi&s;s, are you?&mdash;fine airs you give your&s;elf, indeed!&mdash;<HI>ma foi,</HI> if you had n't come, you might have &s;tayed, I a&s;&s;ure you, and have been a beggar for your pains."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heyday, Madam,"</Q> cried the Captain, pranc|ing forward, with a look of great glee,) <Q REND="inline">"what, a'n't you got out of that there pa&s;&s;ion yet? why then, I'll tell you what to do to cool your&s;elf; call upon your old friend, Mon&s;ieur Slippery, who was with you at Ranelagh, and give my &s;ervice to him, and tell him, if he &s;ets any &s;tore by your health, that I de&s;ire he'll give you &s;uch another &s;ou&s;e as he did before: he'll know what I mean, and I'll war|rant you he'll do't for my &s;ake."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let him, if he dares!"</Q> cried Madame Duval; <Q REND="inline">"but I &s;ha'n't &s;tay to an&s;wer you no more; you are a vulgar fellow,&mdash;and &s;o, child, let us leave him to him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hark ye, Madam,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you'd be&s;t not call names, becau&s;e, d'ye &s;ee, if you do, I &s;hall make bold to &s;how you the door."</Q></P>
<P>She changed colour, and, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI> I can &s;hew it my&s;elf,"</Q> hurried out of the room, and I followed her into a hackney-coach. But, be|fore we drove off, the Captain, looking out of the parlour window, called out, <Q REND="inline">"D'ye hear, Madam,&mdash;don't forget my me&s;&s;age to Mon&s;ieur."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="129">
You will believe, our ride was not the mo&s;t agreeable in the world; indeed, it would be dif|ficult to &s;ay which was lea&s;t plea&s;ed, Madame Du|val or me, though the rea&s;ons of our di&s;content were &s;o different: however, Madame Duval &s;oon got the &s;tart of me; for we had hardly turned out of Queen-Anne-&s;treet, when a man, running full &s;peed, &s;topt the coach. He came up to the win|dow, and I &s;aw he was the Captain's &s;ervant. He had a broad grin on his face, and panted for breath. Madame Duval demanded his bu&s;ine&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"Ma|dam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"my ma&s;ter de&s;ires his com|pliments to you, and&mdash;and&mdash;and he &s;ays he wi&s;hes it well over with you. He! he! he!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Madame Duval in&s;tantly darted forward, and gave him a violent blow on the face; <Q REND="inline">"Take that back for your an&s;wer, &s;irrah,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and learn to grin at your betters another time. Coach|man, drive on!"</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ervant was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore terribly; but we were &s;oon out of hearing.</P>
<P>The rage of Madame Duval was greater than ever, and &s;he inveighed again&s;t the Captain with &s;uch fury, that I was even apprehen&s;ive &s;he would have returned to his hou&s;e, purpo&s;ely to reproach him, which &s;he repeatedly threatened to do; nor would &s;he, I believe, have he&s;itated a moment, but that, notwith&s;tanding her violence, he has really made her afraid of him.</P>
<P>When we came to her lodgings, we found all the Branghtons in the pa&s;&s;age, impatiently waiting for us, with the door open.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Only &s;ee, here's Mi&s;s!"</Q> cried the brother.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I declare I thought as much!"</Q> &s;aid the younger &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="130">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I think you might as well have come with your cou&s;ins at once; it's throwing money in the dirt, to pay two coaches for one fare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, father,"</Q> cried the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"make no words about that; for I'll pay for the coach that Mi&s;s had."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I know very well,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Brangh|ton, <Q REND="inline">"that you're always more ready to &s;pend than to earn."</Q></P>
<P>I then interfered, and begged that I might my|&s;elf be allowed to pay the fare, as the expence was incurred upon my account; they all &s;aid <HI>no,</HI> and propo&s;ed that the &s;ame coach &s;hould carry us on to the opera.</P>
<P>While this pa&s;&s;ed, the Mi&s;s Branghtons were examining my dre&s;s, which, indeed, was very improper for my company; and, as I was ex|tremely unwilling to be &s;o con&s;picuous among&s;t them, I reque&s;ted Madame Duval to borrow a hat or bonnet for me of the people of the hou&s;e. But &s;he never wears either her&s;elf, and thinks them very <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and barbarous; therefore &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould go full dre&s;&s;ed, as I had pre|pared my&s;elf for the pit, though I made many objections.</P>
<P>We were then all crowded into the &s;ame carri|age; but when we arrived at the opera-hou&s;e, I contrived to pay the coachman. They made a great many &s;peeches; but Mr. Branghton's reflec|tion had determined me not to be indebted to him.</P>
<P>If I had not been too much chagrined to laugh, I &s;hould have been extremely diverted at their ig|norance of whatever belongs to an opera. In the fir&s;t place, they could not tell at what door we
<PB N="116" REF="131">
ought to enter, and we wandered about for &s;ome time, without knowing which way to turn: they did not chu&s;e to apply to me, though I was the only per&s;on of the party who had ever before been at an opera; becau&s;e they were unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e that their <HI>country cou&s;in,</HI> as they were plea&s;|ed to call me, &s;hould be better acquainted with any London public place than them&s;elves. I was very indifferent and carele&s;s upon this &s;ubject, but not a little unea&s;y at finding my dre&s;s, &s;o different from that of the company to which I belonged, attracted general notice and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time however we arrived at one of the door-keeper's <HI>bars.</HI> Mr. Branghton demand|ed for what part of the hou&s;e they took money? They an&s;wered the pit, and regarded us all with great earne&s;tne&s;s. The &s;on then advancing, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you plea&s;e, I beg that I may treat Mi&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We'll &s;ettle that another time,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Branghton, and put down a guinea.</P>
<P>Two tickets of admi&s;&s;ion were given to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton, in his turn, now &s;tared at the door-keeper, and demanded what he meant by giving him only two tickets for a guinea?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Only two, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid the man, <Q REND="inline">"why don't you know that the tickets are half a guinea each?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Half a guinea each!"</Q> repeated Mr. Brangh|ton, <Q REND="inline">"why I never heard of &s;uch a thing in my life! And pray, Sir, how many will they admit?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t as u&s;ual, Sir, one per&s;on each."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But one per&s;on for half a guinea!&mdash;why I only want to &s;it in the pit, friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had not the Ladies better &s;it in the gallery, Sir; for they'll hardly chu&s;e to go into the pit with their hats on?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="132">
<Q REND="inline">"O, as to that,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"if our hats are too high, we'll take them off when we get in. I &s;ha'n't mind it, for I did my hair on purpo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Another party then approaching, the door-keeper coul no longer attend to Mr. Branghton, who, tak|ing up the guinea, told him it &s;hould be long enough before he'd &s;ee it again, and walked away.</P>
<P>The young ladies, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e, that their <HI>papa</HI> &s;hould not know the opera prices, which for their parts they had read in the papers a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The price of &s;tocks"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"is enough for me to &s;ee after; and I took it for granted it was the &s;ame thing here as at the play-hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew well enough what the price was,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"but I would not &s;peak, becau&s;e I thought perhaps they'd take le&s;s, as we're &s;uch a large party."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters both laughed very contemptuou&s;ly at this idea, and a&s;ked him if he ever heard of <HI>people's abating</HI> any thing at a public place?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know whether I have or no,"</Q> an|&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"but I'm &s;ure if they would, you'd like it &s;o much the wor&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very true, Tom,</Q> cried Mr. Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"tell a woman that any thing is rea&s;onable, and &s;he'll be &s;ure to hate it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"I hope that Aunt and Mi&s;s will be of our &s;ide, for Papa always takes part with Tom."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> cried Madam Duval, <Q REND="inline">"if you &s;tand talking here, we &s;ha'n't get no place at all."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Branghton then enquired the way to the gal|lery, and, when we came to the door-keeper, de|manded what was to pay.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="133">
<Q REND="inline">"The u&s;ual price, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the man.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then give me change,"</Q> cried Mr. Branghton, again putting down his guinea.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For how many, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why&mdash;let's &s;ee,&mdash;for &s;ix."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For &s;ix, Sir? why you've given me but a guinea."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>But</HI> a guinea! why how much would you have? I &s;uppo&s;e it i'n't half a guinea apiece here too?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, only five &s;hillings."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Branghton again took up his unfortunate guinea, and prote&s;ted he would &s;ubmit to no &s;uch impo&s;ition. I then propo&s;ed that we &s;hould return home, but Madame Duval would not con&s;ent, and we were conducted, by a woman who &s;ells books of the Opera, to another gallery-door, where, after &s;ome di&s;puting, Mr. Branghton at la&s;t paid, and we all went up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Madame Duval complained very much of the trouble of going &s;o high, but Mr. Branghton de|&s;ired her not to hold the place too cheap, <Q REND="inline">"for, whatever you may think,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you I paid pit price; &s;o don't &s;uppo&s;e I come here to &s;ave my money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, to be &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"there's no judging of a place by the out&s;ide, el&s;e, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, there's nothing very extraordi|nary in the &s;tair-ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>But, when we entered the gallery, their amaze|ment and di&s;appointment became general. For a few in&s;tants, they looked at one another without &s;peaking, and then they all broke &s;ilence at once.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Papa,</Q> exclaimed Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"why you have brought us to the one-&s;hilling gallery!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="134">
<Q REND="inline">"I'll be glad to give you two &s;hillings, though,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to pay. I was never &s;o fooled out of my money before, &s;ince the hour of my birth.

<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;at in &s;uch a mean place in all my life;&mdash;why it's as high!&mdash;we &s;ha'n't &s;ee nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought, at the time,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"that three &s;hillings was an exorbitant price for a place in the gallery, but as we'd been a&s;ked &s;o much more at the other doors, why I paid it with|out many words; but then, to be &s;ure, thinks I, it never can be like any other gallery,&mdash;we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome <HI>crinkum-crankum</HI> or other for our money;&mdash;but I find it's as arrant a take-in as ever I met with."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why it's as like the twelvepenny gallery at Drury-lane,"</Q> cried the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"as two peas are one to another. I never knew father &s;o bit before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord,</Q> "&s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I thought it would have been quite a fine place,&mdash;all over I don't know what,&mdash;and done quite in ta&s;te."</Q></P>
<P>In this manner they continued to expre&s;s their di&s;&s;atisfaction till the curtain drew up; after which, their ob&s;ervations were very curious. They made no allowance for the cu&s;toms, or even for the lan|guage of another country, but formed all their re|marks upon compari&s;ons with the Engli&s;h theatre.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my vexation at having been forced into a party &s;o very di&s;agreeabl, and that, too, from one &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;o very much the con|trary&mdash;yet, would they have &s;uffered me to li&s;ten, I &s;hould have forgotten every thing unplea&s;ant, and &s;elt nothing but delight, in hearing the &s;weet voice

of Signor Millico, the fir&s;t &s;inger; but they tor|mented me with continual talking."</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a jabbering they make!"</Q> cried Mr. Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"there's no knowing a word they &s;ay. Pray what's the rea&s;on they can't as well &s;ing in Engli&s;h?&mdash;but I &s;uppo&s;e the fine folks would not like it, if they could under&s;tand it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How unnatural their action is!"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on; <Q REND="inline">"why now who ever &s;aw an Engli&s;hman put him|&s;elf in &s;uch out-of-the-way po&s;tures?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For my part,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"I think it's very pretty, only I don't know what it means."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, what does that &s;ignify?"</Q> cried her &s;i&s;ter; <Q REND="inline">"mayn't one like a thing without being &s;o very particular?&mdash;You may &s;ee that Mi&s;s likes it, and I don't &s;uppo&s;e &s;he knows more of the matter than we do."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman, &s;oon after, was &s;o obliging as to make room in the front row for Mi&s;s Branghton and me. We had no &s;ooner &s;eated our&s;elves, than Mi&s;s Branghton exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good gracious! only &s;ee!&mdash;why, Polly, all the people in the pit are without hats, dre&s;&s;ed like any thing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, &s;o they are,</Q> cried Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"well, I never &s;aw the like!&mdash;it's worth coming to the Opera if one &s;aw nothing el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>I was then able to di&s;tingui&s;h the happy party I had left; and I &s;aw that Lord Orville had &s;eated him&s;elf next to Mrs. Mirvan. Sir Clement had his eyes perpetually ca&s;t towards the five &s;hilling gallery, where I &s;uppo&s;e he concluded that we were &s;eated; however, before the Opera was over, I have rea&s;on to believe that he had di&s;covered me, high and di&s;tant as I was from him. Pro|bably he di&s;tingui&s;hed me by my head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="136">
At the end of the fir&s;t act, as the green curtain dropped, to prepare for the dance, they imagined that the Opera was done, and Mr. Branghton ex|pre&s;&s;ed great indignation that he had been <HI>tricked</HI> out of his money with &s;o little trouble. <Q REND="inline">"Now if any Engli&s;hman was to do &s;uch an impudent thing as this,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"why he'd be pelted;&mdash;but here, one of the&s;e outlandi&s;h gentry may do ju&s;t what he plea&s;es, and come on, and &s;queak out a &s;ong or two, and then pocket your money with|out further ceremony."</Q></P>
<P>However, &s;o determined he was to be di&s;&s;atis|fied, that, before the conclu&s;ion of the third act, he found &s;till more fault with the Opera for being too long, and wondered whether they thought their &s;inging good enough to &s;erve us for &s;upper.</P>
<P>During the &s;ymphony of a &s;ong of Signor Mil|lico's, in the &s;econd act, young Mr. Branghton &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It's my belief that that fellow's going to &s;ing another &s;ong!&mdash;why there's nothing but &s;ing|ing!&mdash;I wonder when they'll &s;peak."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ong, which was &s;low and pathetic, caught all my attention, and I leaned my head forward to avoid hearing their ob&s;ervations, that I might li&s;ten without interruption; but, upon turning round, when the &s;ong was over, I found that I was the object of general diver&s;ion to the whole party; for the Mi&s;s Branghtons were tittering, and the two gentlemen making &s;igns and faces at me, implying their contempt of my affectation.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery determined me to appear as in|attentive as them&s;elves; but I was very much pro|voked at being thus prevented enjoying the only plea&s;ure, which, in &s;uch a party, was within my power.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="137">
<Q REND="inline">"So, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"you're quite in the fa&s;hion, I &s;ee;&mdash;&s;o you like Operas? well, I'm not &s;o polite; I can't like non&s;en&s;e, let it be never &s;o much the ta&s;te."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But pray, Mi&s;s,</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"what makes that fellow look &s;o doleful while he's &s;inging?"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then I think he might as well let alone &s;inging till he's in better cue: it's out of all nature for a man to be piping when he's in di&s;tre&s;s. For my part, I never &s;ing but when I'm merry; yet I love a &s;ong as well as mo&s;t people."</Q></P>
<P>When the curtain dropt, they all rejoiced.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How do <HI>you</HI> like it?&mdash;and how do <HI>you</HI> like it?"</Q> pa&s;&s;ed from one to another with looks of the utmo&s;t contempt. <Q REND="inline">"As for me,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Brangh|ton, <Q REND="inline">"they've caught me once, but if ever they do again, I'll give 'em leave to &s;ing me to Bedlam for my pains: for &s;uch a heap of &s;tuff never did I hear; there is n't one ounce of &s;en&s;e in the whole Opera, nothing but one continued &s;queaking and &s;qualling from beginning to end."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I had been in the pit,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Du|val, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have liked it va&s;tly, for mu&s;ic is my pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;itting in &s;uch a place as this, is quite unbearable."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Branghton, looking at me, declared, that &s;he was not <HI>genteel</HI> enough to admire it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Polly confe&s;&s;ed, that, if they would but &s;ing <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;he &s;hould like it <HI>very well.</HI></P>
<P>The brother wi&s;hed he could rai&s;e a riot in the hou&s;e, becau&s;e then he might get his money again.</P>
<P>And, finally, they all agreed, that it was <HI>mon|&s;trous dear.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="138">
During the la&s;t dance, I perceived, &s;tanding near the gallery-door, Sir Clement Willoughby. I was extremely vexed, and would have given the world to have avoided being &s;een by him: my chief objection was, from the apprehen&s;ion that he wou'd hear Mi&s;s Branghton call me <HI>cou&s;in.</HI>&mdash;I fear you will think this London journey has made me grow very proud, but indeed this family is &s;o low-bred and vulgar, that I &s;hould be equally a&s;hamed of &s;uch a connexion in the country, or any where. And really I had already been &s;o much chagrined that Sir Clement had been a witne&s;s of Madame Duval's power over me, that I could not bear to be expo&s;ed to any further mortification.</P>
<P>As the &s;eats cleared, by parties going away, Sir Clement approached nearer to us; the Mi&s;s Branghtons ob&s;erved with &s;urpri&s;e, what a fine gentleman was come into the gallery, and they gave me great rea&s;on to expect, that they would endeavour to attract his notice, by familiarity with me, whenever he &s;hould join us; and &s;o, I formed a &s;ort of plan, to prevent any conver&s;ation. I am afraid you will think it wrong; and &s;o I do my&s;elf, now,&mdash;but, at the time, I only con&s;idered how I might avoid immediate humiliation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was within two &s;eats of us, he &s;poke to me, <Q REND="inline">"I am very happy, Mi&s;s Anville, to have &s;ound you, for the Ladies below have each an humble attendant, and therefore I am come to offer my &s;ervices here."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> cried I, (not without he&s;itating) <Q REND="inline">"if you plea&s;e,&mdash;I will join them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you allow me the honour of conducting you?"</Q> cried he eagerly; and, in&s;tantly taking my hand, he would have marched away with me: but I turned to Madame Duval, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"As our
<PB N="124" REF="139">
party is &s;o large, Madam, if you will give me leave, I will go down to Mrs. Mirvan, that I may not crowd you in the coach."</Q></P>
<P>And then, without waiting for an an&s;wer, I &s;uffered Sir Clement to hand me out of the gal|lery.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, I doubt not, will be very an|gry, and &s;o I am with my&s;elf, now, and therefore I cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed: but Mr. Branghton, I am &s;ure, will ea&s;ily comfort him&s;elf, in having e&s;caped the additional coach expence of carrying me to Queen-Ann-&s;treet; as to his daughters, they had no time to &s;peak, but I &s;aw they were in utter amazement.</P>
<P>My intention was to join Mrs. Mirvan, and accompany her home. Sir Clement was in high &s;pirits and good humour; and, all the way we went, I was fool enough to rejoice in &s;ecret at the &s;ucce&s;s of my plan; nor was it till I got down &s;tairs, and amid&s;t the &s;ervants, that any difficulty occurred to me of meeting with my friends.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked Sir Clement how I &s;hould contrive to acquaint Mrs. Mirvan that I had left Madame Duval?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to find her,</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"but you can have no objec|tion to permitting me to &s;ee you &s;afe home."</Q></P>
<P>He then de&s;ired his &s;ervant, who was waiting, to order his chariot to draw up.</P>
<P>This quite &s;tartled me; I turned to him ha&s;tily, and &s;aid that I could not think of going away without Mrs. Mirvan.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how can we meet with her?"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"you will not chu&s;e to go into the pit your&s;elf; I cannot &s;end a &s;ervant there; and it is impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>me</HI> to go and leave you alone?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="140">
The truth of this was indi&s;putable, and totally &s;ilenced me. Yet, as &s;oon as I could recollect my|&s;elf, I determined not to go in his chariot, and told him I believed I had be&s;t return to my party up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>He would not hear of this; and earne&s;tly en|treated me not to withdraw the tru&s;t I had repo|&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>While he was &s;peaking, I &s;aw Lord Orville, with &s;everal ladies and gentlemen, coming from the pit pa&s;&s;age: unfortunately, he &s;aw me too, and, leaving his company, advanced in&s;tantly to|wards me, and, with an air and voice of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, do I &s;ee Mi&s;s Anville!"</Q></P>
<P>I now mo&s;t &s;everely felt the folly of my plan, and the aukwardne&s;s of my &s;ituation; however, I ha&s;tened to tell him, though in a he&s;itating manner, that I was waiting for Mrs. Mirvan! but what was my di&s;appointment, when he acquainted me that &s;he was already gone home!</P>
<P>I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; to &s;uffer Lord Orville to think me &s;atisfied with the &s;ingle pro|tection of Sir Clement Willoughby, I could not bear; yet I was more than ever aver&s;e to return|ing to a party which I dreaded his &s;eeing: I &s;tood &s;ome moments in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and could not help ex|claiming, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven, what can I do!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Madam,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould you be thus unea&s;y?&mdash;you will reach Queen-Ann &s;treet almo&s;t as &s;oon as Mrs. Mirvan, and I am &s;ure you cannot doubt being as &s;afe."</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer, and Lord Orville then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My coach is here; and my &s;ervants are ready to take any commands Mi&s;s Anville will honour me with for them. I &s;hall my&s;elf go home in a chair, and therefore&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="141">
How grateful did I feel for a propo&s;al &s;o con&s;ide|rate, and made with &s;o much delicacy! I &s;hould gladly have accepted it, had I been permitted, but Sir Clement would not let him even fini&s;h his &s;peech; he interrupted him with evident di&s;plea|&s;ure, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, my own chariot is now at the door."</Q></P>
<P>And ju&s;t then the &s;ervant came, and told him the carriage was ready. He begged to have the honour of conducting me to it, and would have taken my hand, but I drew it back, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I can't&mdash;I can't indeed! pray go by your&s;elf&mdash;and as to me, let me have a chair."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> (cried he with vehemence) <Q REND="inline">"I cannot think of tru&s;ting you with &s;trange chairmen,&mdash;I cannot an&s;wer it to Mrs. Mirvan,&mdash;come, dear Madam, we &s;hall be home in five minutes."</Q></P>
<P>Again I &s;tood &s;u&s;pended. With what joy would I then have compromi&s;ed with my pride, to have been once more with Madame Duval and the Branghtons, provided I had not met with Lord Orville! However, I flatter my&s;elf that he not only &s;aw, but pitied my embarra&s;&s;ment, for he &s;aid, in a tone of voice unu&s;ually &s;oftened, <Q REND="inline">"To offer my &s;ervices in the pre&s;ence of Sir Clement Willoughby would be &s;uperfluous; but I hope I need not a&s;&s;ure Mi&s;s Anville, how happy it would make me to be of the lea&s;t u&s;e to her."</Q></P>
<P>I court&s;ied my thanks. Sir Clement with great eagerne&s;s pre&s;&s;ed me to go; and while I was thus unea&s;ily deliberating what to do, the dance, I &s;up|po&s;e, fini&s;hed, for the people crowded down &s;tairs. Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer, I &s;hould have accepted it, notwith&s;tanding Sir Clement's re|pugnance; but I fancy he thought it would be im|pertinent. In a very few minutes I heard Madame
<PB N="127" REF="142">
Duval's voice, as &s;he de&s;cended from the gallery; <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried I, ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline">"if I mu&s;t go&mdash;".</Q> I &s;topt, but Sir Clement immediately handed me into his chariot, called out <Q REND="inline">"Queen-Ann-&s;treet,"</Q> and then jumped in him&s;elf. Lord Orville, with a bow and a half &s;mile, wi&s;hed me good night.</P>
<P>My concern was &s;o great, at being &s;een and left by Lord Orville in &s;o &s;trange a &s;ituation, that I &s;hould have been be&s;t plea&s;ed to have remained wholly &s;ilent during our ride home: but Sir Cle|ment took care to prevent that.</P>
<P>He began by making many complaints of my unwillingne&s;s to tru&s;t my&s;elf with him, and begged to know what could be the rea&s;on. This que&s;tion &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed me, that I could not tell what to an&s;wer, but only &s;aid, that I was &s;orry to have taken up &s;o much of his time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> (cried he, taking my hand) <Q REND="inline">"if you knew with what tran&s;port I would dedicate to you not only the pre&s;ent but all the future time allotted to me, you would not injure me by making &s;uch an apology."</Q></P>
<P>I could not think of a word to &s;ay to this, nor to a great many other equally fine &s;peeches with which he ran on, though I would fain have with|drawn my hand, and made almo&s;t continual at|tempts; but in vain, for he actually gra&s;ped it be|tween both his, without any regard to my re&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>Soon after, he &s;aid that he believed the coach|man was going the wrong way, and he called to his &s;ervant, and gave him directions. Then ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, <Q REND="inline">"How often, how a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly have I &s;ought an opportunity of &s;peaking to you, without the pre&s;ence of that brute Captain Mirvan! Fortune has now kindly favoured me

with one, and permit me,"</Q> (again &s;eizing my hand) <Q REND="inline">"permit me to u&s;e it, in telling you that I adore you!"</Q></P>
<P>I was quite thunder&s;truck at this abrupt and un|expected declaration. For &s;ome moments I was &s;ilent, but, when I recovered from my &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir, if you were determined to make me repent leaving my own party &s;o fooli&s;hly, you have very well &s;ucceeded."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t life,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible you can be &s;o cruel? Can your nature and your countenance be &s;o totally oppo&s;ite? Can the &s;weet bloom upon tho&s;e charming cheeks, which appears as much the re&s;ult of good-humour as of beau|ty&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, Sir,</Q> cried I, interrupting him, <Q REND="inline">"this is very fine; but I had hoped we had had enough of this &s;ort of conver&s;ation at the Ridotto, and I did not expect you would &s;o &s;oon re&s;ume it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What I then &s;aid, my &s;weet reproacher, was the effect of a mi&s;taken, a prophane idea, that your under&s;tanding held no competition with your beauty; but now, now that I find you equally in|comparable in both, all words, all powers of &s;peech, are too feeble to expre&s;s the admiration I feel of your excellencies."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"if you did not talk in one language, and think in another, you would never &s;uppo&s;e that I could give credit to prai&s;e &s;o very much above my de&s;ert."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech, which I made very gravely, occa|&s;ioned &s;till &s;tronger prote&s;tations, which he conti|nued to pour forth, and I continued to di&s;claim, till I began to wonder that we were not in Queen-Ann-Street, and begged he would de&s;ire the coach|man to drive fa&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="144">
<Q REND="inline">"And does this little moment,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"which is the fir&s;t of happine&s;s I have ever known, does it already appear &s;o very long to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am afraid the man has mi&s;taken the way,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"or el&s;e we &s;hould ere now have been at our journey's end. I mu&s;t beg you will &s;peak to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you think me &s;o much my own ene|my?&mdash;if my good genius has in&s;pired the man with a de&s;ire of prolonging my happine&s;s, can you expect that I &s;hould counteract its indul|gence?"</Q></P>
<P>I now began to apprehend that he had him&s;elf ordered the man to go a wrong way, and I was &s;o much alarmed at the idea, that, the very in&s;tant it occurred to me, I let down the gla&s;s, and made a &s;udden effort to open the chariot-door my&s;elf, with a view of jumping into the &s;treet; but he caught hold of me, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, what is the matter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I&mdash;I don't know,"</Q> cried I, (quite out of breath) <Q REND="inline">"but I am &s;ure the man goes wrong, and, if you will not &s;peak to him, I am determined I will get out my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You amaze me,"</Q> an&s;wered he, (&s;till holding me) <Q REND="inline">"I cannot imagine what you apprehend. Surely you can have no doubts of my honour?"</Q></P>
<P>He drew me towards him as he &s;poke. I was dreadfully frightened, and could hardly &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no,&mdash;none at all,&mdash;only Mrs. Mirvan,&mdash;I think &s;he will be unea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whence this alarm, my deare&s;t angel?&mdash;What can you fear?&mdash;my life is at your devo|tion, and can you, then, doubt my protection?"</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, he pa&s;&s;ionately ki&s;&s;ed my hand.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="145">
Never, in my whole life, have I been &s;o terri|fied. I broke forcibly from him, and, putting my head out of the window, called aloud to the man to &s;top. Where we then were I knew not, but I &s;aw not a human being, or I &s;hould have called for help.</P>
<P>Sir Clement, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, endeavour|ed to appea&s;e and compo&s;e me; <Q REND="inline">"If you do not intend to murder me,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"for mercy's, for pity's &s;ake, let me get out!"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very, very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"you a&s;k a promi&s;e which you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible I ought not to grant, and yet dare not refu&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Drive on!"</Q> cried he to the coachman;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville, I will not compel you; I will ex|act no promi&s;e, but tru&s;t wholly to your genero|&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>This rather &s;oftened me; which advantage he no &s;ooner perceived, than he determined to avail him&s;elf of, for he flung him&s;elf on his knees, and pleaded with &s;o much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that I was really obliged to forgive him, becau&s;e his humili|ation made me quite a&s;hamed: and, after that, he would not let me re&s;t till I gave him my word that I would not complain of him to Mrs. Mir|van.</P>
<P>My own folly and pride, which had put me in his power, were pleas which I could not but at|tend to in his favour. However, I &s;hall take very particular care never to be again alone with him.</P>
<P>When, at la&s;t, we arrived at our hou&s;e, I was &s;o overjoyed, that I &s;hould certainly have pardoned him then, if I had not before. As he handed me up &s;tairs, he &s;colded his &s;ervant aloud, and very angrily, for having gone &s;o much out of the way. Mi&s;s Mirvan ran out to meet me,&mdash;and who &s;hould I &s;ee behind her, but&mdash;Lord Orville!</P>
<P>All my joy now vani&s;hed, and gave place to &s;hame and confu&s;ion; for I could not endure that he &s;hould know how long a time Sir Clement and
<PB N="132" REF="147">
I had been together, &s;ince I was not at liberty to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>They all expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing me, and &s;aid they had been extremely unea&s;y and &s;urpri&s;ed that I was &s;o long coming home, as they had heard from Lord Orville that I was not with Madame Duval. Sir Clement, in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid that his booby of a &s;ervant had mi&s;under&s;tood his orders, and was driving us to the upper end of Piccadilly. For my part, I only coloured, for though I would not forfeit my word, I yet di&s;|dained to confirm a tale in which I had my&s;elf no belief.</P>
<P>Lord Orville, with great politene&s;s, congratu|lated me that the troubles of the evening had &s;o happily ended, and &s;aid, that he had found it im|po&s;&s;ible to return home, before he enquired after my &s;afety.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time he took leave, and Sir Cle|ment followed him. As &s;oon as they were gone, Mrs. Mirvan, though with great &s;oftne&s;s, blamed me for having quitted Madame Duval. I a&s;&s;ured her, and with truth, that for the future I would be more prudent.</P>
<P>The adventures of the evening &s;o much di&s;con|certed me, that I could not &s;leep all night. I am under the mo&s;t cruel apprehen&s;ions, left Lord Or|ville &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e my being on the gallery-&s;tairs with Sir Clement was a concerted &s;cheme, and even that our continuing &s;o long together in his chariot, was with my approbation, &s;ince I did not &s;ay a word on the &s;ubject, nor expre&s;s any di&s;&s;atis|faction at the coachman's pretended blunder.</P>
<P>Yet, his coming hither to wait our arrival, though it &s;eems to imply &s;ome doubt, &s;hews al&s;o &s;ome anxiety. Indeed Mi&s;s Mirvan &s;ays, that he
<PB N="133" REF="148">
appeared <HI>extremely</HI> anxious, nay unea&s;y and impa|tient for my return. If I did not fear to flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hould think it not impo&s;&s;ible but that he had a &s;u&s;picion of Sir Clement's de&s;ign, and was therefore concerned for my &s;afety.</P>
<P>What a long letter is this! however, I &s;hall not write many more from London, for the Cap|tain &s;aid this morning, that he would leave town on Tue&s;day next. Madame Duval will dine here to-day, and then &s;he is to be told his intention.</P>
<P>I am very much amazed that &s;he accepted Mrs. Mirvan's invitation, as &s;he was in &s;uch wrath ye&s;|terday. I fear that to-day I &s;hall my&s;elf be the principal object of her di&s;plea&s;ure; but I mu&s;t &s;ubmit patiently, for I cannot defend my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Sir. Should this letter be productive of any unea&s;ine&s;s to you, more than ever &s;hall I repent the heedle&s;s imprudence which it recites.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday Morning, April 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MRS. Mirvan has ju&s;t communicated to me an anecdote concerning Lord Orville, which has much &s;urpri&s;ed, half plea&s;ed, and half pained me.</P>
<P>While they were &s;itting together during the Opera, he told her that he had been greatly con|cerned at the impertinence which the young lady under her protection had &s;uffered from Mr. Lovel; but that he had the plea&s;ure of a&s;&s;uring her, &s;he had no future di&s;turbance to apprehend from him.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="149">
Mrs. Mirvan, with great eagerne&s;s, begged he would explain him&s;elf, and &s;aid &s;he hoped he had not thought &s;o in&s;ignificant an affair worthy his &s;e|rious attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is nothing,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"which re|quires more immediate notice than impertinence, for it ever encroaches when it is tolerated."</Q> He then added, that he believed he ought to apologize for the liberty he had taken of interfering, but that, as he regarded him&s;elf in the light of a <HI>party concerned,</HI> from having had the honour of dancing with Mi&s;s Anville, he could not po&s;&s;ibly reconcile to him&s;elf a patient neutrality.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell her, that he had waited upon Mr. Lovel the morning after the play; that the vi&s;it had proved an amicable one, but the particulars were neither entertaining nor nece&s;&s;ary; he only a&s;&s;ured her, Mi&s;s Anville might be perfectly ea&s;y, &s;ince Mr. Lovel had en|gaged his honour never more to mention, or even to hint at what had pa&s;&s;ed at Mrs. Stanley's a&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction at this conclu&s;ion, and thanked him for his polite atten|tion to her young friend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It would be needle&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to reque&s;t that this affair may never tran&s;pire, &s;ince Mrs. Mir|van cannot but &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping it in|violably &s;ecret; but I thought it incumbent upon me, as the young lady is under your protection, to a&s;&s;ure both you and her of Mr. Lovel's future re&s;pect."</Q></P>
<P>Had I known of this vi&s;it previous to Lord Or|ville's making it, what dreadful unea&s;ine&s;s would it have co&s;t me! Yet that he &s;hould &s;o much in|tere&s;t him&s;elf in &s;ecuring me from offence, gives
<PB N="135" REF="150">
me, I mu&s;t own, an internal plea&s;ure greater than I can expre&s;s, for I feared he had too contemp|tuous an opinion of me, to take any trouble upon my account. Though, after all, this interference might rather be to &s;atisfy his own delicacy, than from thinking well of me.</P>
<P>But how cool, how quiet is true courage! Who, from &s;eeing Lord Orville at the play, would have imagined his re&s;entment would have hazarded his life? yet his di&s;plea&s;ure was evident, though his real bravery and his politene&s;s equally guarded him from entering into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in our pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, as I expected, was mo&s;t ter|ribly angry ye&s;terday; &s;he &s;colded me for I believe two hours, on account of having left her, and pro|te&s;ted &s;he had been &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at my going, without giving her time to an&s;wer, that &s;he hardly knew whether &s;he was awake or a&s;leep. But &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, that if ever I did &s;o again, &s;he would never more take me into public. And &s;he expre&s;&s;ed an equal degree of di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Sir Clement, becau&s;e he had not even &s;poken to her, and becau&s;e he was always of the Captain's &s;ide in an argument. The Captain, as bound in honour, warmly de|fended him, and then followed a di&s;pute in the u&s;ual &s;tyle.</P>
<P>After dinner, Mrs. Mirvan introduced the &s;ub|ject of our leaving London. Madame Duval &s;aid &s;he &s;hould &s;tay a month or two longer. The Cap|tain told her &s;he was welcome, but that he and his family &s;hould go into the country on Tue&s;day morning.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;cene followed; Madame Duval in&s;i&s;ted upon keeping me with her; but Mrs. Mirvan &s;aid, that as I was actually engaged on a vi&s;it to Lady Howard, who had only con&s;ented to
<PB N="136" REF="151">
my leaving her for a few days, &s;he could not think of returning without me.</P>
<P>Perhaps if the Captain had not interfered, the good-breeding and mildne&s;s of Mrs. Mirvan might have had &s;ome effect upon Madame Duval; but he pa&s;&s;es no opportunity of provoking her, and therefore made &s;o many gro&s;s and rude &s;peeches, all of which &s;he retorted, that, in conclu&s;ion, &s;he vowed &s;he would &s;ooner go to law, in right of her relation&s;hip, than that I &s;hould be taken away from her.</P>
<P>I heard this account from Mrs. Mirvan, who was &s;o kindly con&s;iderate as to give me a pretence for quitting the room, as &s;oon as this di&s;pute begun, le&s;t Madame Duval &s;hould refer to me, and in&s;i&s;t on my obedience.</P>
<P>The final re&s;ult of the conver&s;ation, was, that, to &s;often matters for the pre&s;ent, Madame Duval &s;hould make one in the party for Howard Grove, whither we are po&s;itively to go next Wedne&s;day.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan is now writing to Lady Howard, to excu&s;e bringing this unexpected gue&s;t, and to prevent the di&s;agreeable &s;urpri&s;e, which mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, attend her reception. This dear lady &s;eems eternally &s;tudying my happine&s;s and advan|tage.</P>
<P>To-night we go to the Pantheon, which is the la&s;t diver&s;ion we &s;hall partake of in London, for to-morrow&mdash;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>This moment, my deare&s;t Sir, I have received your kind letter.</P>
<P>If you thought us too di&s;&s;ipated the fir&s;t week, I almo&s;t fear to know what you will think of us
<PB N="137" REF="152">
this &s;econd;&mdash;however, the Pantheon this even|ing will probably be the la&s;t public place which I &s;hall ever &s;ee.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;urance of your &s;upport and protection in regard to Madame Duval, though what I never doubted, excites my utmo&s;t gratitude: how, in|deed, cheri&s;hed under your roof, the happy ob|ject of your con&s;tant indulgence, how could I have borne to become the &s;lave of her tyrannical hu|mours?&mdash;pardon me that I &s;peak &s;o hardly of her, but, whenever the idea of pa&s;&s;ing my days with her occurs to me, the compari&s;on which naturally fol|lows, takes from me all that forbearance, which, I believe, I owe her.</P>
<P>You are already di&s;plea&s;ed with Sir Clement: to be &s;ure, then, his behaviour after the opera will not make his peace with you. Indeed, the more I reflect upon it, the more angry I am. I was en|tirely in his power, and it was cruel in him to cau&s;e me &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>O my deare&s;t Sir, were I but worthy the prayers and the wi&s;hes you offer for me, the utmo&s;t am|bition of my heart would be fully &s;atisfied! but I greatly fear you will find me, now that I am out of the reach of your a&s;&s;i&s;ting prudence, more weak and imperfect than you could have expected.</P>
<P>I have not now time to write another word, for I mu&s;t immediately ha&s;ten to dre&s;s for the evening.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Queen-Ann-&s;treet, <DATE>Tue&s;day, April 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is &s;omething to me half melancholy in writing an account of our la&s;t adventures in London; however, as this day is merely appro|priated to packing, and preparations for our journey, and as I &s;hall &s;hortly have no more adventures to write, I think I may as well complete my town journal at once. And, when you have it all to|gether, I hope, my dear Sir, you will &s;end me your ob&s;ervations and thoughts upon it to Howard Grove.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock we went to the Pantheon. I was extremely &s;truck with the beauty of the building, which greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed whatever I could have expected or imagined. Yet, it has more the appearance of a chapel, than of a place of diver|&s;ion; and, though I was quite charmed with the magnificence of the room, I felt that I could not be as gay and thoughtle&s;s there as at Ranelagh, for there is &s;omething in it which rather in&s;pires awe and &s;olemnity, than mirth and plea&s;ure. How|ever, perhaps it may only have this effect upon &s;uch a novice as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;aid, that our party con&s;i&s;ted only of Captain, Mrs. and Mi&s;s Mirvan, as Madame Duval &s;pent the day in the city:&mdash;which I own I could not lament.</P>
<P>There was a great deal of company; but the fir&s;t per&s;on we &s;aw was Sir Clement Willoughby. He addre&s;&s;ed us with his u&s;ual ea&s;e, and joined us
<PB N="139" REF="154">
for the whole evening. I felt my&s;elf very unea&s;y in his pre&s;ence; for I could not look at him, nor hear him &s;peak, without recollecting the chariot adventure; but, to my great amazement, I ob|&s;erved that he looked at <HI>me</HI> without the lea&s;t ap|parent di&s;compo&s;ure, though certainly he ought not to think of his behaviour without blu&s;hing. I really wi&s;h I had not forgiven him, and then he could not have ventured to &s;peak to me any more.</P>
<P>There was an exceeding good concert, but too much talking to hear it well. Indeed I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed to find how little mu&s;ic is attended to in &s;ilence; for though every body &s;eems to admire, hardly any body li&s;tens.</P>
<P>We did not &s;ee Lord Orville, till we went into the tea-room, which is large, low, and under ground, and &s;erves merely as a foil to the apart|ments above; he then &s;at next to us; he &s;eemed to belong to a large party, chiefly of ladies; but, among the gentlemen attending them, I perceived Mr. Lovel.</P>
<P>I was extremely irre&s;olute whether or not I ought to make any acknowledgments to Lord Or|ville for his generous conduct in &s;ecuring me from the future impertinence of that man; and I thought, that as he had &s;eemed to allow Mrs. Mirvan to ac|quaint me, though no one el&s;e, of the mea&s;ures which he had taken, he might perhaps &s;uppo&s;e me ungrateful if &s;ilent: however I might have &s;pared my&s;elf the trouble of deliberating, as I never once had the &s;hadow of an opportunity of &s;peaking unheard by Sir Clement. On the contrary, he was &s;o exceedingly officious and forward, that I could not &s;ay a word to any body, but in&s;tantly he bent his head forward, with an air of profound at|tention, as if I had addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf wholly to
<PB N="140" REF="155">
him: and yet, I never once looked at him, and would not have &s;poken to him on any account.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mrs. Mirvan her&s;elf, though unac|quainted with the behaviour of Sir Clement after the opera, &s;ays it is not right for a young woman to be &s;een &s;o frequently in public with the &s;ame gentleman; and, if our &s;tay in town was to be lengthened, &s;he would endeavour to repre&s;ent to the Captain the impropriety of allowing his con|&s;tant attendance; for Sir Clement, with all his <HI>ea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> could not be &s;o eternally of our parties, if the Captain was le&s;s fond of his company.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame table with Lord Orville, &s;at a gen|tleman,&mdash;I call him &s;o only becau&s;e he <HI>was</HI> at the &s;ame table,&mdash;who, almo&s;t from the moment I was &s;eated, fixed his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on my face, and never once removed them to any other object dur|ing tea-time, notwith&s;tanding my di&s;like of his &s;tar|ing mu&s;t, I am &s;ure, have been very evident. I was quite &s;urpri&s;ed, that a man who&s;e boldne&s;s was &s;o offen&s;ive, could have gained admi&s;&s;ion into a party of which Lord Orville made one; for I na|turally concluded him to be &s;ome low-bred, and uneducated man; and I thought my idea was in|dubitably confirmed, when I heard him &s;ay to Sir Clement Willoughby, in an <HI>audible whi&s;per,</HI>&mdash;which is a mode of &s;peech very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and di&s;agree|able to by-&s;tanders,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, Wil|loughby, who is that lovely creature?"</Q></P>
<P>But what was my amazement, when, li&s;ten|ing attentively for the an&s;wer, though my head was turned another away, I heard Sir Clement &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry I cannot inform your Lord&s;hip, but I am ignorant my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lord&s;hip!</HI>&mdash;how extraordinary! that a <HI>nobleman,</HI> accu&s;tomed, in all probability, to the fir&s;t rank
<PB N="141" REF="156">
of company in the kingdom, from his earlie&s;t in|fancy, can po&s;&s;ibly be deficient in <HI>good manners,</HI> however faulty in morals and principles! Even Sir Clement Willoughby appeared mode&s;t in compa|ri&s;on with this per&s;on.</P>
<P>During tea, a conver&s;ation was commenced up|on the times, fa&s;hions, and public places, in which the company of both tables joined. It began by Sir Clement's enquiring of Mi&s;s Mirvan and of me if the Pantheon had an&s;wered our expectations.</P>
<P>We both readily agreed that it had greatly ex|ceeded them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, to be &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"why you don't &s;uppo&s;e they'd confe&s;s they did n't like it, do you? Whatever's the fa&s;hion, they mu&s;t like of cour&s;e;&mdash;or el&s;e I'd be bound for it they'd own, that there never was &s;uch a dull place as this here invented."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And has, then, this building,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"no merit that may &s;erve to le&s;&s;en your cen&s;ure? Will not your eye, Sir, &s;peak &s;omething in its favour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Eye,"</Q> cried the Lord, (I don't know his name,) <Q REND="inline">"and is there any eye here, that can find any plea&s;ure in looking at dead walls or &s;tatues, when &s;uch heavenly living objects as I now &s;ee demand all their admiration?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"the life|le&s;s &s;ymmetry of architecture, however beautiful the de&s;ign and proportion, no man would be &s;o mad as to put in competition with the animated charms of nature: but when, as to-night, the eye may be regaled at the &s;ame time, and in one view, with all the excellence of art, and all the perfec|tion of nature, I cannot think that either &s;uffer by being &s;een together."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="157">
<Q REND="inline">"I grant, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"that the cool eye of unimpa&s;&s;ioned philo&s;ophy may view both with equal attention, and equal &s;afety; but, where the heart is not &s;o well guarded, it is apt to interfere, and render, even to the eye, all objects but one in&s;ipid and unintere&s;ting."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you may talk what you will of your eye here, and your eye there, and, for the matter of that, to be &s;ure you have two,&mdash;but we all know they both &s;quint one way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Far be it from me,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"to di&s;pute the <HI>magnetic</HI> power of beauty, which ir|re&s;i&s;tibly draws and attracts whatever has &s;oul and &s;ympathy: and I am happy to acknowledge, that though we have now no <HI>gods</HI> to occupy a man&s;ion profe&s;&s;edly built for them, yet we have &s;ecured their <HI>better halves,</HI> for we have <HI>godde&s;&s;es</HI> to whom we all mo&s;t willingly bow down."</Q> And then, with a very droll air, he made a profound reve|rence to the ladies.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They'd need be godde&s;&s;es with a vengeance,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"for they're mortal dear to look at. How&s;omever, I &s;hould be glad to know what you can &s;ee in e'er a face among them that's worth half a guinea for a &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Half a guinea,"</Q> exclaimed that &s;ame Lord, <Q REND="inline">"I would give half I am worth, for a &s;ight of only <HI>one,</HI> provided I make my own choice. And, prithee, how can money be better employed than in the &s;ervice of fine women?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If the ladies of his own party can pardon the Captain's &s;peech,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"I think he has a fair claim to the forgivene&s;s of all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you depend very much, as I doubt not but you may,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"upon the ge|neral
<PB N="143" REF="158">
&s;weetne&s;s of the &s;ex;&mdash;but, as to the ladies of the Captain's party, they may ea&s;ily pardon, for they cannot be hurt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But they mu&s;t have a devili&s;h good conceit of them&s;elves, though,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"to believe all that. How&s;omever, whether or no, I &s;hould be glad to be told, by &s;ome of you who &s;eem to be knowing in them things, what kind of diver&s;ion can be found in &s;uch a place as this here, for one who has had, long ago, his full of face-hunting?"</Q></P>
<P>Every body laughed, but nobody &s;poke.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why look you there, now,"</Q> continued the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you're all at a dead &s;tand!&mdash;not a man among you can an&s;wer that there que&s;tion. Why, then, I mu&s;t make bold to conclude, that you all come here for no manner of purpo&s;e but to &s;tare at one another's pretty faces;&mdash;though, for the matter of that, half of 'em are plaguy ugly,&mdash;and, as to t'other half,&mdash;I believe it's none of God's manufactory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What the ladies may come hither for, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, (&s;troking his ruffles, and looking down,) <Q REND="inline">"it would ill become <HI>us</HI> to determine; but as to we men, doubtle&s;s we can have no other view, than to admire them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I be n't mi&s;taken,"</Q> cried the Captain, (looking earne&s;tly in his face,) <Q REND="inline">"you are that &s;ame per&s;on we &s;aw at Love for Love t'other night;&mdash;be n't you?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Lovel bowed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, Gentlemen,"</Q> continued he, with a loud laugh, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t tell you a mo&s;t excellent good joke;&mdash;when all was over, as &s;ure as you're alive, he a&s;ked what the play was! Ha, ha, ha!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="159">
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr Lovel, colouring, <Q REND="inline">"if you were as much u&s;ed to a town life as I am,&mdash;which, I pre&s;ume, is not preci&s;ely the ca&s;e,&mdash;I fancy you would not find &s;o much diver&s;ion from a circum|&s;tance &s;o common."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Common! what, is it common?"</Q> repeated the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"why then, 'fore George, &s;uch chaps are more fit to be &s;ent to &s;chool, and well di&s;ciplined with a cat o' nine tails, than to poke their heads into a play-hou&s;e. Why, a play is the only thing left, now-a-days, that has a grain of &s;en&s;e in it; for as to all the re&s;t of your public places, d'ye &s;ee, if they were all put together, I would n't give <HI>that</HI> for 'em!"</Q> &s;napping his fingers. <Q REND="inline">"And now we're talking of them &s;ort of things, there's your operas,&mdash;I &s;hould like to know, now, what any of you can find to &s;ay for them."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville, who was mo&s;t able to have an|&s;wered, &s;eemed by no means to think the Captain worthy an argument, upon a &s;ubject concerning which he had neither knowledge nor feeling: but, turning to us, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The ladies are &s;ilent, and we &s;eem to have engro&s;&s;ed the conver&s;ation to our|&s;elves, in which we are much more our own ene|mies than theirs. But,"</Q> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Mirvan and me, <Q REND="inline">"I am mo&s;t de&s;irous to hear the opinions of the&s;e young ladies, to whom all public places mu&s;t, as yet, be new."</Q></P>
<P>We both, and with eagerne&s;s, declared that we had received as much, if not more plea&s;ure, at the opera than any where: but we had better have been &s;ilent; for the Captain, quite di&s;plea&s;ed, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">what &s;ignifies a&s;king them girls? Do you think they know their own minds yet? A&s;k 'em after any thing that's called diver&s;ion, and you're &s;ure they'll &s;ay it's va&s;tly fine;&mdash;they are &s;et of
<PB N="145" REF="160">
parrots, and &s;peak by rote, for they all &s;ay the &s;ame thing: but a&s;k 'em how they like making puddings and pies, and I'll warrant you'll po&s;e 'em. As to them operas, I de&s;ire I may hear no more of their liking &s;uch mon&s;en&s;e; and for you, Moll,"</Q> to his daughter, <Q REND="inline">"I charge you, as you value my favour, that you'll never again be &s;o impertinent as to have a ta&s;te of your own before my face. There are fools enough in the world, without your adding to their number. I'll have no daugh|ter of mine affect them &s;ort of megrims. It is a &s;hame they a'n't put down; and if I'd my will, there's not a magi&s;trate in this town, but &s;hould be knocked of the head for &s;uffering them. If you've a mind to prai&s;e any thing, why you may prai&s;e a play, and welcome, for I like it my|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>This reproof effectually &s;ilenced us both for the re&s;t of the evening. Nay, indeed, for &s;ome mi|nutes it &s;eemed to &s;ilence every body el&s;e; till Mr. Lovel, not willing to lo&s;e an opportunity of re|turning the Captain's &s;arca&s;m, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, really, Sir, it is but natural, to be mo&s;t plea&s;ed with what is mo&s;t familiar, and, I think, of all our diver&s;i|ons, there is not one &s;o much in common between us and the country, as a play. Not a village but has its barns and comedians; and as for the &s;tage|bu&s;ine&s;s, why it may be pretty equally done any where; and even in regard to <HI>us,</HI> and the <HI>canaille,</HI> confined as we all are within the &s;emi-circle of a theatre, there is no place where the di&s;tinction is le&s;s obvious."</Q></P>
<P>While the Captain &s;eemed con&s;idering for Mr. Lovel's meaning, Lord Orville, probably with a view to prevent his finding it, changed the &s;ubject
<PB N="146" REF="161">
to Cox's Mu&s;eum, and a&s;ked what he thought of it?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Think!&mdash;"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"why I think as how it i'n't worth thinking about. I like no &s;uch <HI>jem cracks.</HI> It is only fit, in my mind, for monkeys,&mdash;though, for I aught I know, they too might turn up their no&s;es at it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May we a&s;k your Lord&s;hip's own opinion?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The mechani&s;m,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"is wonder|fully ingenious: I am &s;orry it is turned to no bet|ter account; but its purport is &s;o frivolous, &s;o very remote from all aim at in&s;truction or utility, that the &s;ight of &s;o fine a &s;hew, only leaves a regret on the mind, that &s;o much work, and &s;o much inge|nuity, &s;hould not be better be&s;towed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The truth is,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"that in all this huge town, &s;o full as it is of folks of all &s;orts, there i'n't &s;o much as one public place, be|&s;ides the play-hou&s;e, where a man, that's to &s;ay a man who <HI>is</HI> a man, ought not to be a&s;hamed to &s;hew his face. T'other day, they got me to a ridotto; but I believe it will be long enough be|fore they get me to another. I knew no more what to do with my&s;elf, than if my &s;hip's company had been metamorpho&s;ed into Frenchmen. Then, again, there's your famous Ranelagh, that you make &s;uch a fu&s;s about,&mdash;why what a dull place is that!&mdash;its the wor&s;t of all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ranelagh dull!"&mdash;"Ranelagh dull!"</Q> was echoed from mouth to mouth, and all the ladies, as if of one accord, regarded the Captain with looks of the mo&s;t ironical contempt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to Ranelagh,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t indubitably, though the price is plebeian, it is by no means adapted to the plebeian ta&s;te. It requires
<PB N="147" REF="162">
a certain acquaintance with high life, and&mdash;and&mdash;and &s;omething of&mdash;of&mdash;&s;omething <HI>d'un vrai go&ucirc;t,</HI> to be really &s;en&s;ible of its merit. Tho&s;e who&s;e&mdash;who&s;e connections, and &s;o forth, are not among <HI>les gens comme il faut,</HI> can feel nothing but <HI>ennui</HI> at &s;uch a place as Ranelagh.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ranelagh!"</Q> cried Lord &mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"O, 'tis the divine&s;t place under heaven,&mdash;or, indeed,&mdash;for aught I know &mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O you creature!"</Q> cried a pretty, but affect|ed young lady, patting him with her fan, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;han't talk &s;o; I know what you are going to &s;ay; but, po&s;itively, I won't &s;it by you, if you're &s;o wicked."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how can one &s;it by you, and be good?"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"when only to look at you is enough to make one wicked&mdash;or wi&s;h to be &s;o?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fie, my Lord!"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you are really in&s;ufferable. I don't think I &s;hall &s;peak to you again the&s;e &s;even years."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a metamorpho&s;is,"</Q> cried Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould you make a patriarch of his Lord|&s;hip!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Seven years!"</Q> &s;aid he: <Q REND="inline">"dear Madam, be contented with telling me you will not &s;peak to me <HI>after</HI> &s;even years, and I will endeavour to &s;ub|mit."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, very well, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"pray date the end of our &s;peaking to each other as early as you plea&s;e, I'll promi&s;e to agree to your time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know, dear Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;ip|ping his tea, <Q REND="inline">"you know I only live in your &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="163">
<Q REND="inline">"O yes, my Lord, I have long known that. But I begin to fear we &s;hall be too late for Ranelagh this evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, looking at his watch, <Q REND="inline">"it is but ju&s;t pa&s;t ten."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No more!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"O then we &s;hall do very well."</Q></P>
<P>All the ladies then &s;tarted up, and declared they had no time to lo&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what the D&mdash;l,"</Q> cried the Captain, (leaning forward with both his arms on the ta|ble,) <Q REND="inline">are you going to Ranelagh at this time of night?"</Q></P>
<P>The ladies looked at one another, and &s;miled.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Ranelagh?"</Q> cried Lord &mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, and I hope you are going too; for we cannot po&s;&s;i|bly excu&s;e the&s;e ladies."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I go to Ranelagh?&mdash;if I do, I'll be &mdash;."</Q></P>
<P>Every body now &s;tood up, and the &s;tranger Lord, coming round to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You</HI> go, I hope?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, I believe not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O you cannot, mu&s;t not be &s;o barbarous."</Q> And he took my hand, and ran on &s;aying &s;uch fine &s;peeches and compliments, that I might almo&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf a godde&s;s, and him a pagan, paying me adoration. As &s;oon as I po&s;&s;ibly could, I drew back my hand; but he frequently, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, contrived to take it again, though it was extremely di&s;agreeable to me; and the more &s;o, as I &s;aw that Lord Orville had his eyes fixed upon us, with a gravity of attention that made me unea&s;y.</P>
<P>And, &s;urely, my dear Sir, it was a great liberty in this Lord, notwith&s;tanding his rank, to treat me
<PB N="149" REF="164">
&s;o freely. As to Sir Clement, he &s;eemed in mi&s;e|ry.</P>
<P>They all endeavoured to prevail with the Captain to join the Ranelagh party; and this Lord told me, in a low voice, that <HI>it was tearing his heart out</HI> to go without me.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, Mr. Lovel came for|ward, and a&s;&s;uming a look of &s;urpri&s;e, made me a bow, and enquired how I did, prote&s;ting, upon his honour, that he had not &s;een me before, or would &s;ooner have paid his re&s;pects to me.</P>
<P>Though his politene&s;s was evidently con&s;trained, yet I was very glad to be thus a&s;&s;ured of having nothing more to fear from him.</P>
<P>The Captain, far from li&s;tening to their per&s;ua|&s;ions of accompanying them to Ranelagh, was quite in a pa&s;&s;ion at the propo&s;al, and vowed he would &s;ooner go to the <HI>Black-hole in Calcutta.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;aid Lord &mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"if the <HI>ladies</HI> will take their tea at Ranelagh, you may depend upon our &s;eeing them &s;afe home, for we &s;hall all be proud of the honour of attending them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May be &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"but I'll tell you what, if one of the&s;e places be n't enough for them to-night, why to-morrow they &s;hall go to ne'er a one."</Q></P>
<P>We in&s;tantly declared our&s;elves very ready to go home.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not for your&s;elves that we petition,"</Q> &s;aid Lord &mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"but for <HI>us;</HI> if you have any charity, you will not be &s;o cruel as to deny us; we only beg you to prolong our happine&s;s for a few mi|nutes,&mdash;the favour is but a &s;mall one for you to grant, though &s;o great a one for us to receive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To tell you a piece of my mind,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, &s;urlily, <Q REND="inline">"I think you might as well not
<PB N="150" REF="165">
give the girls &s;o much of this palaver: they'll take it all for go&s;pel. As to Moll, why &s;he's well enough, but nothing extraordinary, though, per|haps, you may per&s;uade her that her pug-no&s;e is all the fa&s;hion: and as to the other, why &s;he's good white and red, to be &s;ure; but what of that?&mdash;I'll warrant &s;he'll moulder away as fa&s;t as her neighbours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is there,"</Q> cried Lord &mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"another man in this place, who, &s;eeing &s;uch objects, could make &s;uch a &s;peech?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to that there,"</Q> returned the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know whether there be or no, and, to make free, I don't care; for I &s;ha'n't go for to model my&s;elf by any of the&s;e fair-weather chaps, who dare not &s;o much as &s;ay their &s;ouls are their own,&mdash;and, for aught I know, no more they ben't. I'm almo&s;t as much a&s;hamed of my countrymen, as if I was a Frenchman, and I believe in my heart there i'n't a pin to chu&s;e between them; and, before long, we &s;hall hear the very &s;ailors talking that lingo, and &s;ee never a &s;wabber without a bag and a &s;word."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He, he, he!&mdash;well, 'pon honour,"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel <Q REND="inline">"you gentlemen of the ocean have a mo&s;t &s;evere way of judging."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Severe! 'fore George, that is impo&s;&s;ible; for, to cut the matter &s;hort, the men, as they call them&s;elves, are no better than monkeys; and as to the women, why they are mere dolls. So, now you've got my opinion of this &s;ubject; and &s;o I wi&s;h you good night."</Q></P>
<P>The ladies, who were very impatient to be gone, made their court&s;ies, and tripped away, fol|lowed by all the gentlemen of their party, except the Lord I have before-mentioned, and Lord
<PB N="151" REF="166">
Orville, who &s;tayed to make enquiries of Mrs. Mirvan concerning our leaving town; and then &s;aying, with his u&s;ual politene&s;s, &s;omething civil to each of us, with a very grave air, he quit|ted us.</P>
<P>Lord&mdash;remained &s;ome minutes longer, which he &s;pent in making a pro&s;u&s;ion of com|pliments to me, by which he prevented my hear|ing di&s;tinctly what Lord Orville &s;aid, to my great vexation, e&s;pecially as he looked&mdash;I thought &s;o, at lea&s;t,&mdash;as if di&s;plea&s;ed at his particularity of be|haviour to me.</P>
<P>In going to an outward room, to wait for the carriage, I walked, and could not po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, between this nobleman and Sir Clement Wil|loughby; and, when the &s;ervant &s;aid the coach &s;topped the way, though the latter offered me his hand, which I &s;hould much have preferred, this &s;ame Lord, without any ceremony, took mine him&s;elf; and Sir Clement, with a look ex|tremely provoked, conducted Mrs. Mirvan.</P>
<P>In all ranks and all &s;tations of li&s;e, how &s;trange|ly do characters and manners differ! Lord Orville, with a politene&s;s which knows no intermi&s;&s;ion, and makes no di&s;tinction, is as una&s;&s;uming and mode&s;t, as if he had never mixed with the great, and was totally ignorant of every qualification he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; this other Lord, though lavi&s;h of compliments and fine &s;peeches, &s;eems to be an entire &s;tranger to real good breeding; whoever &s;trikes his fancy, engro&s;&s;es his whole attention. He is forward and bold, has an air of haughtine&s;s towards men, and a look of libertini&s;m towards women, and his con|cious quality &s;eems to have given him a freedom in his way of &s;peaking to either &s;ex, that is very lit|tle &s;hort of rudene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="167">
When we returned home, we were all low|&s;pirited; the evening's entertainment had di&s;plea&s;ed the Captain, and his di&s;plea&s;ure, I believe, di&s;con|certed us all.</P>
<P>And here I thought to have concluded my letter; but, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, ju&s;t now we had a vi&s;it from Lord Orville. He called, he &s;aid, to pay his re&s;pects to us before we left town, and made many enquiries concerning our return; and, when Mrs. Mirvan told him we were going into the country without any view of again quitting it, he expre&s;&s;ed his concern in &s;uch terms&mdash;&s;o polite, &s;o flattering, &s;o &s;erious&mdash;that I could hardly forbear being &s;orry my&s;elf. Were I to go immediately to Berry Hill, I am &s;ure I &s;hould feel nothing but joy;&mdash;but, now we are joined by this Captain, and by Madame Duval, I mu&s;t own I expect very little plea&s;ure at Howard Grove.</P>
<P>Before Lord Orville went Sir Clement Wil|loughby called. He was more grave than I had ever &s;een him, and made &s;everal attempts to &s;peak to me in a low voice, and to a&s;&s;ure me that his regret upon the occa&s;ion of our journey, was en|tirely upon my account. But I was not in &s;pirits, and could not bear to be teazed by him. However, he has &s;o well paid his court to Captain Mirvan, that he gave him a very hearty invitation to the Grove. At this, he brightened,&mdash;and, ju&s;t then, Lord Orville took his leave!</P>
<P>No doubt but he was di&s;gu&s;ted at this ill-timed, ill-bred partiality; for &s;urely it was very wrong to make an invitation before Lord Orville, in which he was not included! I was &s;o much chagrined that, as &s;oon as he went, I left the room; and I &s;hall not go down &s;tairs till Sir Clement is gone.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="168">
Lord Orville cannot but ob&s;erve his a&s;&s;iduous endeavours to ingratiate him&s;elf into my favour; and does not this extravagant civility of Captain Mirvan, give him rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that it meets with our general approbation? I cannot think upon this &s;ubject, without inexpre&s;&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;and yet, I can think of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Sir. Pray write to me im|mediately. How many long letters has this one &s;hort fortnight produced! More than I may, pro|bably, ever write again: I fear I &s;hall have tired you with reading them, but you will now have time to re&s;t, for I &s;hall find but little to &s;ay in future.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>April 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW much do I rejoice that I can again ad|dre&s;s my letters to Howard Grove! My Evelina would have grieved, had &s;he known the anxiety of my mind, during her re&s;idence in the great world. My apprehen&s;ions have been inexpre&s;&s;ibly alarm|ing; and your journal, at once exciting and
<PB N="154" REF="169">
relieving my fears, has almo&s;t wholly occupied me, &s;ince the time of your dating it from London.</P>
<P>Sir Clement Willoughby mu&s;t be an artful, de|&s;igning man; I am extremely irritated at his con|duct. The pa&s;&s;ion he pretends for you has neither &s;incerity nor honour; the manner and the oppor|tunities he has cho&s;en to declare it, are bordering upon in&s;ult.</P>
<P>His unworthy behaviour after the opera, convin|ces me, that, had not your vehemence frightened him, Queen-Ann-Street would have been the la&s;t place whither he would have ordered his chariot. O my child, how thankful am I for your e&s;cape! I need not now, I am &s;ure, enlarge upon your in|di&s;cretion and want of thought, in &s;o ha&s;tily tru&s;t|ing your&s;elf with a man &s;o little known to you, and who&s;e gaiety and flightine&s;s &s;hould have put you on your guard.</P>
<P>The nobleman you met at the Pantheon, bold and forward as you de&s;cribe him to be, gives me no apprehen&s;ion; a man who appears &s;o openly li|centious, and who makes his attack with &s;o little regard to decorum, is one who, to &s;uch a mind as my Evelina's, can never be &s;een but with the di&s;gu&s;t which his manners ought to excite.</P>
<P>But Sir Clement, though he &s;eeks occa&s;ions to give real offence, contrives to avoid all appearance of intentional evil. He is far more dangerous, be|cau&s;e more artful; but I am happy to ob&s;erve, that he &s;eems to have made no impre&s;&s;ion upon your heart, and therefore a very little care and prudence may &s;ecure you from tho&s;e de&s;igns which I fear he has formed.</P>
<P>Lord Orville appears to be of a better order of beings. His &s;pirited conduct to the meanly imper|tinent Lovel, and his anxiety for you after the
<PB N="155" REF="170">
opera, prove him to be a man of &s;en&s;e and of feel|ing. Doubtle&s;s he thought there was much rea&s;on to tremble for your &s;afety, while expo&s;ed to the power of Sir Clement; and he acted with a re|gard to real honour, that will always incline me to think well of him, in &s;o immediately acquaint|ing the Mirvan family with your &s;ituation. Many men of this age, from a fal&s;e and pretended deli|cacy to a friend, would have quietly pur&s;ued their own affairs, and thought it more honourable to leave an un&s;u&s;pecting young creature to the mercy of a libertine, than to ri&s;k his di&s;plea&s;ure by taking mea&s;ures for her &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Your evident concern at leaving London, is very natural; and yet it afflicts me. I ever dread|ed your being too much plea&s;ed with a life of di&s;|&s;ipation, which youth and vivacity render but too alluring; and I almo&s;t regret the con&s;ent for your journey, which I had not the re&s;olution to with|hold.</P>
<P>Alas, my child, the artle&s;&s;ne&s;s of your nature, and the &s;implicity of your education, alike unfit you for the thorny paths of the great and bu&s;y world. The &s;uppo&s;ed ob&s;curity of your birth and &s;ituation, makes you liable to a thou&s;and di&s;agree|able adventures. Not only my views, but my hopes for your future life, have ever centered in the country. Shall I own to you, that, however I may differ from Captain Mirvan in other re|&s;pects, yet my opinion of the town, its manners, inhabitants, and diver&s;ions, is much upon a level with his own? Indeed it is the general harbour of fraud and of folly, of duplicity and of imperti|nence; and I wi&s;h few things more fervently, than that you may have taken a la&s;ting leave of it.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="171">
Remember, however, that I only &s;peak in re|gard to a public and a di&s;&s;ipated life; in private families, we may doubtle&s;s find as much goodne&s;s, hone&s;ty, and virtue, in London as in the country.</P>
<P>If contented with a retired &s;tation, I &s;till hope I &s;hall live to &s;ee my Evelina the ornament of her neighbourhood, and the pride and delight of her family: giving and receiving joy from &s;uch &s;ociety as may be&s;t de&s;erve her affection, and employing her&s;elf in &s;uch u&s;eful and innocent occupations as may &s;ecure and merit the tendere&s;t love of her friends, and the worthie&s;t &s;atisfaction of her own heart.</P>
<P>Such are my hopes, and &s;uch have been my expectations. Di&s;appoint them not, my beloved child, but chear me with a few lines, that may a&s;&s;ure me, this one &s;hort fortnight &s;pent in town, has not undone the work of &s;eventeen years &s;pent in the country.</P>

<P>NO, my dear Sir, no; <HI>the work of &s;eventeen years</HI> remains &s;uch as it was, ever unworthy your time and your labour, but not more &s;o now,&mdash;at lea&s;t I hope not,&mdash;than before that fortnight which has &s;o much alarmed you.</P>
<P>And yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I am not half &s;o happy here at pre&s;ent, as I was ere I went to town: but the change is in the place, not in me. Captain
<PB N="157" REF="172">
Mirvan and Madame Duval have ruined Howard Grove. The harmony that reigned here, is di&s;|turbed, our &s;chemes are broken, our way of life is altered, and our comfort is de&s;troyed. But do not &s;uppo&s;e <HI>London</HI> to be the &s;ource of the&s;e evils; for, had our excur&s;ion been any where el&s;e, &s;o di&s;agree|able an addition to our hou&s;hold, mu&s;t have cau&s;ed the &s;ame change at our return.</P>
<P>I was &s;ure you would be di&s;plea&s;ed with Sir Cle|ment, and therefore I am by no means &s;urpri&s;ed at what you &s;ay of him: but for lord Orville&mdash;I mu&s;t own I had greatly feared, that my weak and im|perfect account would not have procured him the good opinion which he &s;o well de&s;erves, and which I am delighted to find you &s;eem to have of him. O, Sir, could I have done ju&s;tice to the merit of which I believe him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,&mdash;could I have paint|ed him to <HI>you</HI> &s;uch as he appeared to <HI>me,</HI>&mdash;then, indeed, you would have had &s;ome idea of the claim which he has to your approbation!</P>
<P>After the la&s;t letter which I wrote in town, no|thing more pa&s;&s;ed previous to our journey hither, except a very violent quarrel between Captain Mir|van and Madame Duval. As the Captain intend|ed to travel on hor&s;eback, he had &s;ettled that we four females &s;hould make u&s;e of his coach. Ma|dame Duval did not come to Queen Ann-&s;treet, till the carriage had waited &s;ome time at the door, and then, attended by Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, &s;he made her appearance.</P>
<P>The Captain, impatient to be gone, would not &s;uffer them to enter the hou&s;e, but in&s;i&s;ted that we &s;hould immediately get into the coach. We obeyed; but were no &s;ooner &s;eated than Madame Duval &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Come, Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, the&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="173">
girls can make very good room for you; &s;it clo&s;er, children."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan looked quite confounded, and M. Du Bois, after making &s;ome apologies about crowd|ing us, actually got into the coach, on the &s;ide with Mi&s;s Mirvan and me. But no &s;ooner was he &s;eated than the Captain, who had ob&s;erved this tran&s;action very quietly, walked up to the coach|door, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"What neither with your leave, nor by your leave?"</Q></P>
<P>M. Du Bois &s;eemed rather &s;hocked, and began to make abundance of excu&s;es; but the Captain neither under&s;tood nor regarded him, and, very roughly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Look'ee, Mon&s;ieur, this here may be a French fa&s;hion, for aught I know;&mdash;but Give and Take is fair, in all nations; and &s;o now, d'ye &s;ee, I'll make bold to &s;hew you an Engli&s;h one."</Q></P>
<P>And then &s;eizing his wri&s;t, he made him jump out of the coach.</P>
<P>M. Du Bois in&s;tantly put his hand upon his &s;word, and threatened to re&s;ent this indignity. The Cap|tain, holding up his &s;tick, bid him draw at his peril. Mrs. Mirvan, greatly alarmed, got out of the coach, and &s;tanding between them, entreated her hu&s;band to re-enter the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None of your clack!"</Q> cried he, angirly, <Q REND="inline">"what the D&mdash;l, do you &s;uppo&s;e I can't ma|nage a Frenchman?"</Q></P>
<P>Mean time, Madame Duval called out to M. Du Bois, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eh, lai&s;&s;ez-le, mon ami, ne le corriger pas; c' e&s;t un vilain b&ecirc;te qui ne vaut pas la peine.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mon&s;ieur le Capitaine,</HI>"</Q> cried M. Du Bois, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>voulez-vous bien me demander pardon?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O ho, you demand pardon; do you?"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"I thought as much; I thought you'd come to;&mdash;&s;o you have lo&s;t your reli&s;h for
<PB N="159" REF="174">
an Engli&s;h &s;alutation, have you?"</Q> &s;trutting up to him with looks of defiance.</P>
<P>A crowd was now gathering, and Mrs. Mirvan again be&s;ought her hu&s;band to go into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what a plague is the woman afraid of?&mdash;did you ever know a Frenchman that could not take an affront?&mdash;I warrant Mon&s;ieur knows what he is about;&mdash;don't you, Mon&s;ieur?"</Q></P>
<P>M. Du Bois, not under&s;tanding him, only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>plait-il, Mon&s;ieur?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, nor <HI>di&s;h</HI> me, neither,"</Q> an&s;wered the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"but be that as it may, what &s;ignifies our parleying here? if you've any thing to propo&s;e, &s;peak at once; if not, why let us go on our journey without more ado."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Parbleu, je n'entends rien, moi!</HI>"</Q> cried M. Du Bois, &s;hrugging his &s;houlders, and looking very di&s;|mal.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan then advanced to him, and faid, in French, that &s;he was &s;ure the Captain had not any intention to affront him, and begged he would de|&s;i&s;t from a di&s;pute which could only be productive of mutual mi&s;under&s;tanding, as neither of them knew the language of the other.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;ible remon&s;trance had the de&s;ired effect, and M. Du Bois, making a bow to every one, ex|cept the Captain, very wi&s;ely gave up the point, and took leave.</P>
<P>We then hoped to proceed quietly on our jour|ney; but the turbulent Captain would not yet per|mit us: he approached Madame Duval with an exulting air, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why how's this, Madam? what, has your champion de&s;erted you? why I thought you told me that you old gentlewomen had it all your own way, among them French &s;parks?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to that, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it's not of no con&s;equence what you thought; for a per&s;on
<PB N="160" REF="175">
who can behave in &s;uch a low way, may think what he plea&s;es for me, for I &s;ha'n't mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, then, Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ince you mu&s;t needs make &s;o free,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"plea&s;e to tell me the rea&s;on why you took the liberty for to a&s;k any of your followers into my coach, without my leave? An&s;wer me to that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, pray, Sir,"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"tell me, the rea&s;on why you took the liberty to treat the gentleman in &s;uch a impolite way, as to take and pull him neck and heels out? I'm &s;ure he had n't done nothing to affront you, nor nobody el&s;e; and I don't know what great hurt he would have done you, by ju&s;t &s;itting &s;till in the coach; he would not have eat it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, do you think, then, that my hor&s;es have nothing to do, but to carry about your &s;nivel|ling Frenchmen? If you do, Madam, I mu&s;t make bold to tell you, you are out, for I'll &s;ee 'em hanged fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More brute you, then! for they've never carried nobody half &s;o good"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Why, look'ee, Madam, if you mu&s;t needs pro|voke me, I'll tell you a piece of my mind; you mu&s;t know, I can &s;ee as far into a mill-&s;tone as another man; and &s;o, if you thought for to fob me off with one of your &s;mirking French puppies for a &s;on-in-law, why you'll find your&s;elf in a hobble,&mdash;that's all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, you're a&mdash;but I won't &s;ay what;&mdash;but, I prote&s;t, I had n't no &s;uch a thought, no more had n't Mon&s;ieur Du Bois."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Mirvan, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hall be very late."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">get away then; off with you, as fa&s;t as you can, it's high time. As to Molly, &s;he's fine lady enough in all con|&s;cience;
<PB N="161" REF="176">
I want none of your French chaps to make her wor&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, he mounted his hor&s;e, and we drove off. And I could not but think with regret of the different feelings we experienced upon leav|ing London, to what had belonged to our enter|ing it!</P>
<P>During the journey, Madame Duval was &s;o ve|ry violent again&s;t the Captain, that &s;he obliged Mrs. Mirvan to tell her, that, when in her pre|&s;ence, &s;he mu&s;t beg her to chu&s;e &s;ome other &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We had a mo&s;t affectionate reception from Lady Howard, who&s;e kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality cannot fail of making every body happy, who is di&s;po&s;ed &s;o to be.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Sir. I hope, though I have hitherto neglected to mention it, that you have al|ways remembered me to whoever has made any enquiry concerning me.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Howard Grove, <DATE>April 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O MY dear Sir, I now write in the greate&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s! Madame Duval has made a propo&s;al which terrifies me to death, and which was as unexpected, as it is &s;hocking.</P>
<P>She had been employed for &s;ome hoursthis af|ternoon in reading letters from London, and, ju&s;t about tea-time, &s;he &s;ent for me into her room, and &s;aid, with a look of great &s;atisfaction, <Q REND="inline">"Come
<PB N="162" REF="177">
here, child, I've got &s;ome very good news to tell you: &s;omething that will &s;urpri&s;e you, I'll give you my word, for you ha'n't no notion of it."</Q></P>
<P>I begged her to explain her&s;elf; and then, in terms which I cannot repeat, &s;he &s;aid &s;he had been con&s;idering what a &s;hame it was, to &s;ee me &s;uch a poor country, &s;hame-faced thing, when I ought to be a fine lady; and that &s;he had long, and upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, blu&s;hed for me, though &s;he mu&s;t own the fault was none of mine: for nothing bet|ter could be expected from a girl who had been &s;o immured. However, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me &s;he had, at length, hit upon a plan, which would make quite another creature of me.</P>
<P>I waited, without much impatience, to hear what this preface led to; but I was &s;oon awakened to more lively &s;en&s;ations, when &s;he acquainted me, that her intention was to prove my birthright, and to claim, by law, the inheritance of my real fa|mily!</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s my ex|treme con&s;ternation, when &s;he thus unfolded her &s;cheme. My &s;urpri&s;e and terror were equally great. I could &s;ay nothing; I heard her with a &s;ilence which I had not the power to break.</P>
<P>She then expatiated very warmly upon the ad|vantages I &s;hould reap from her plan; talked in a high &s;tyle of my future grandeur; a&s;&s;ured me how heartily I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e almo&s;t every body and every thing I had hitherto &s;een; predicted my mar|rying into &s;ome family of the fir&s;t rank in the king|dom; and, finally, &s;aid I &s;hould &s;pend a few months in Paris, where my education and manners might receive their la&s;t poli&s;h.</P>
<P>She enlarged al&s;o upon the delight &s;he &s;hould have, in common with my&s;elf, from mortifying the
<PB N="163" REF="178">
pride of certain people, and &s;hewing them, that &s;he was not to be &s;lighted with impunity.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this di&s;cour&s;e I was relieved by a &s;ummons to tea. Madame Duval was in great &s;pirits; but my emotion was too painful for con|cealment, and every body enquired into the cau&s;e. I would fain have waved the &s;ubject, but Madame Duval was determined to make it public. She told them, that &s;he had it in her head to <HI>make &s;omething</HI> of me, and that they &s;hould &s;oon call me by an|other name than that of Anville, and yet that &s;he was not going to have the child married neither.</P>
<P>I could not endure to hear her proceed, and was going to leave the room; which, when Lady Howard perceived, &s;he begged Madame Duval would defer her intelligence to &s;ome other oppor|tunity; but &s;he was &s;o eager to communicate her &s;cheme, that &s;he could bear no delay, and there|fore they &s;uffered me to go, without oppo&s;ition. Indeed, whenever my &s;ituation or affairs are men|tioned by Madame Duval, &s;he &s;peaks of them with &s;uch bluntne&s;s and &s;everity, that I cannot be en|joined a ta&s;k more cruel than to hear her.</P>
<P>I was afterwards acquainted with &s;ome parti|culars of the conver&s;ation by Mi&s;s Mirvan, who told me that Madame Duval informed them of her plan with the utmo&s;t complacency, and &s;eemed to think her&s;elf very fortunate in having &s;ugge&s;ted it; but &s;oon after, &s;he accidentally betrayed, that &s;he had been in&s;tigated to the &s;cheme by her relations the Branghtons, who&s;e letters, which &s;he received to-day, fir&s;t mentioned the propo&s;al. She declared that &s;he would have nothing to do with any <HI>round|about ways,</HI> but go openly and in&s;tantly to law, in order to prove my birth, real name, and title to the e&s;tate of my ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="179">
How impertinent and officious, in the&s;e Brangh|tons, to interfere thus in my concerns! You can hardly imagine what a di&s;turbance this plan has made in the family. The Captain without en|quiring into any particulars of the affair, has pe|remptorily declared him&s;elf again&s;t it, merely be|cau&s;e it has been propo&s;ed by Madame Duval, and they have battled the point together with great violence. Mrs. Mirvan &s;ays &s;he will not even <HI>think,</HI> till &s;he hears your opinion. But Lady Howard, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, openly avows her approba|tion of Madame Duval's intention: however, &s;he will write her rea&s;ons and &s;entiments upon the &s;ub|ject to you her&s;elf</P>
<P>As to Mi&s;s Mirvan, &s;he is my &s;econd &s;elf, and neither hopes nor fears but as I do. And as to <HI>me,</HI>&mdash;I know not what to &s;ay, nor even what to wi&s;h; I have often thought my fate peculiarly cruel, to have but one parent, and from that one to be bani&s;hed for ever;&mdash;while, on the other &s;ide, I have but too well known and felt the pro|priety of the &s;eparation. And yet, you may much better imagine than I can expre&s;s the internal an|gui&s;h which &s;ometimes oppre&s;&s;es my heart, when I reflect upon the &s;trange indifferency, that mu&s;t occa&s;ion a father never to make the lea&s;t enquiry after the health, the welfare, or even the life of his child!</P>
<P>O Sir, to <HI>me,</HI> the lo&s;s is nothing!&mdash;greatly, &s;weetly, and mo&s;t benevolently have you guarded me from &s;eeling it;&mdash;but for <HI>him,</HI> I grieve indeed!&mdash;I mu&s;t be dive&s;ted, not merely of a filial piety, but of all humanity, could I ever think upon this &s;ubject, and not be wounded to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Again I mu&s;t repeat, I know not what to <HI>wi&s;h:</HI> think for me, therefore, my deare&s;t Sir, and &s;uffer
<PB N="165" REF="180">

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot give a greater proof of the high opinion I have of your candour, than by the liberty I am now going to take, of pre&s;uming to offer you ad|vice, upon a &s;ubject concerning which you have &s;o ju&s;t a claim to act for your&s;elf: but I know you have too unaffected a love of ju&s;tice to be par|tially tenacious of your own judgment.</P>
<P>Madame Duval has been propo&s;ing a &s;cheme which has put us all in commotion, and again&s;t which, at fir&s;t, in common with the re&s;t of my family, I exclaimed; but upon more mature con|&s;ideration, I own my objections have almo&s;t wholly vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme is no other than to commence a law-&s;uit with Sir John Belmont, to prove the va|lidity of his marriage with Mi&s;s Evelyn; the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of which proof, will be &s;ecur|ing his fortune and e&s;tate to his daughter.</P>
<P>And why, my dear Sir, &s;hould not this be? I know that, upon fir&s;t hearing, this plan conveys ideas that mu&s;t &s;hock you; but I know too, that your mind is &s;uperior to being governed by preju|dices,
<PB N="166" REF="181">
or to oppo&s;ing any important cau&s;e on ac|count of a few di&s;agreeable attendant circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Your lovely charge, now fir&s;t entering into life, has merit which ought not to be buried in ob&s;cu|rity. She &s;eems born for an ornament to the world. Nature has been bountiful to her of whatever &s;he had to be&s;tow; and the peculiar attention you have given to her education, has formed her mind to a degree of excellence, that, in one &s;o young, I have &s;carce ever &s;een equalled. Fortune, alone, has hitherto been &s;paring of her gifts; and &s;he, too, now opens the way which leads to all that is left to wi&s;h for her.</P>
<P>What your rea&s;ons may have been, my good Sir, for &s;o carefully concealing the birth, name, and preten&s;ions of this amiable girl, and forbearing to make any claim upon Sir John Belmont, I am to|tally a &s;tranger to; but without knowing, I re|&s;pect them, from the high opinion I have of your character and judgment: but I hope they are not in&s;uperable; for I cannot but think, that it was never de&s;igned, for one who &s;eems meant to grace the world, to have her life devoted to retirement.</P>
<P>Surely Sir John Belmont, wretch as he has &s;hewn him&s;elf, could never &s;ee his accompli&s;hed daughter, and not be proud to own her, and eager to &s;e|cure her the inheritance of his fortune. The ad|miration &s;he met with in town, though merely the effect of her external attractions, was &s;uch that Mrs. Mirvan a&s;&s;ures me, &s;he would have had the mo&s;t &s;plendid offers, had there not &s;eemed to be &s;ome my&s;tery in regard to her birth, which, &s;he was well informed, was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, though vainly, endeavoured to be di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="182">
Can it be right, my dear Sir, that this promi&s;|ing young creature &s;hould be deprived of the for|tune and rank of life, to which &s;he is lawfully en|titled, and which you have prepared her to &s;up|port and to u&s;e her &s;o nobly?&mdash;To de&s;pi&s;e riches, may, indeed, be philo&s;ophic, but to di&s;pen&s;e them worthily, mu&s;t &s;urely be more beneficial to man|kind.</P>
<P>Perhaps a few years, or indeed, a much &s;horter time, may make this &s;cheme impracticable: Sir John, though yet young, leads a life too di&s;&s;ipated for long duration; and, when too late, we may regret that &s;omething was not &s;ooner done; for it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible, after he is gone, to &s;ettle or prove any thing with his heirs and exe|cutors.</P>
<P>Pardon the earne&s;tne&s;s with which I write my &s;en&s;e of this affair; but your charming ward has made me &s;o warmly her friend, that I cannot be in|different upon a &s;ubject of &s;uch importance to her future life.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir;&mdash;&s;end me &s;peedily an an|&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>May 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, Madam, has opened a &s;ource of anxiety to which I look forward with dread, and which to &s;ee clo&s;ed, I &s;carcely dare expect. I am
<PB N="168" REF="183">
unwilling to oppo&s;e my opinion to that of your Lady&s;hip, nor, indeed, can I, but by arguments which, I believe, will rather rank me as a her|mit, ignorant of the world, and fit only for my cell, than as a proper guardian, in an age &s;uch as this, for an accompli&s;hed young woman. Yet, thus called upon, it behoves me to explain, and en|deavour to vindicate, the rea&s;ons by which I have been hitherto guided.</P>
<P>The mother of this dear child,&mdash;who was led to de&s;truction by her own imprudence, the hard|ne&s;s of heart of Madame Duval, and the villainy of Sir John Belmont,&mdash;was once, what her daugh|ter is now, the be&s;t beloved of my heart; and her memory, &s;o long as my own holds, I &s;hall love, mourn, and honour! On the fatal day that her gentle foul left its man&s;ion, and not many hours ere &s;he cea&s;ed to breathe, I &s;olemnly plighted my faith, <HI>That her child, if it lived, &s;hould know no fa|ther, but my&s;elf, or her acknowledged hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot, Madam, &s;uppo&s;e that I found much difficulty in adhering to this promi&s;e, and forbearing to make any <HI>claim</HI> upon Sir John Bel|mont. Could I feel an affection the mo&s;t paternal for this poor &s;ufferer, and not abominate her de|&s;troyer? Could I wi&s;h to deliver to <HI>him,</HI> who had &s;o ba&s;ely betrayed the mother, the helple&s;s and innocent offspring, who, born in &s;o much &s;orrow, &s;eemed entitled to all the compa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s of pity?</P>
<P>For many years, the <HI>name</HI> alone of that man, accidentally &s;poken in my hearing, almo&s;t dive&s;ted me of my chri&s;tianity, and &s;carce could I forbear to execrate him. Yet I &s;ought not, neither did I de&s;ire, to deprive him of his child, had he, with any appearance of contrition, or indeed of huma|nity,
<PB N="169" REF="184">
endeavoured to become le&s;s unworthy &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing; but he is a &s;tranger to all parental feel|ings, and has, with a &s;avage in&s;en&s;ibility, forborne to enquire even into the exi&s;tence of this &s;weet orphan, though the &s;ituation of his injured wife was but too well known to him.</P>
<P>You wi&s;h to be acquainted with my intentions.&mdash;I mu&s;t acknowledge, they were &s;uch as I now perceive would not be honoured with your Lady|&s;hip's approbation: for though I have &s;ometimes thought of pre&s;enting Evelina to her father, and demanding the ju&s;tice which is her due, yet, at other times, I have both di&s;dained and feared the application; di&s;dained, le&s;t it &s;hould be refu&s;ed, and feared, le&s;t it &s;hould be accepted!</P>
<P>Lady Belmont, who was firmly per&s;uaded of her approaching di&s;&s;olution, frequently and ear|ne&s;tly be&s;ought me, that if her infant was a fe|male, I would not abandon her to the direction of a man &s;o wholly unfit to take the charge of her education; but, &s;hould &s;he be importunately demanded, that I would retire with her abroad, and carefully conceal her from Sir John, till &s;ome apparent change in his &s;entiments and conduct &s;hould announce him le&s;s improper for &s;uch a tru&s;t. And often would &s;he &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Should the poor babe have any feelings corre&s;pondent with its mother's, it will have no want, while under your protection."</Q> Alas! &s;he had no &s;ooner quitted it her&s;elf, than &s;he was plunged into a gulph of mi&s;ery, that &s;wallowed up her peace, reputation, and life.</P>
<P>During the childhood of Evelina, I &s;ugge&s;ted a thou&s;and plans for the &s;ecurity of her birth|right;&mdash;but I as oftentimes rejected them. I was in a perpetual conflict, between the de&s;ire that &s;he &s;hould have ju&s;tice done her, and the appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="170" REF="185">
that, while I improved her fortune, I &s;hould endanger her mind. However, as her character began to be formed, and her di&s;po&s;ition to be di&s;played, my perplexity abated; the road before me &s;eemed le&s;s thorny and intricate, and I thought I could perceive the right path from the wrong: for, when I ob&s;erved the artle&s;s open|ne&s;s, the ingenuous &s;implicity of her nature; when I &s;aw that her guilele&s;s and innocent &s;oul fancied all the world to be pure and di&s;intere&s;ted as her&s;elf, and that her heart was open to every impre&s;&s;ion with which love, pity, or art might a&s;&s;ail it;&mdash;then did I flatter my&s;elf, that to follow my own inclination, and to &s;ecure her welfare, was the &s;ame thing; &s;ince, to expo&s;e her to the &s;nares and dangers inevitably encircling a hou&s;e of which the ma&s;ter is di&s;&s;ipated and unprincipled, without the guidance of a mother, or any pru|dent and &s;en&s;ible female, &s;eemed to me no le&s;s than &s;uffering her to &s;tumble into &s;ome dreadful pit, when the &s;un was in its meridian. My plan, therefore, was not merely to educate and to che|ri&s;h her as my own, but to adopt her the heire&s;s of my &s;mall fortune, and to be&s;tow her upon &s;ome worthy man, with whom &s;he might &s;pend her days in tranquillity, chearfulne&s;s, and good humour, untainted by vice, folly, or ambition.</P>
<P>So much for the time pa&s;t. Such have been the motives by which I have been governed; and I hope they will be allowed not merely to account for, but al&s;o to ju&s;tify the conduct which has re|&s;ulted from them. It now remains to &s;peak of the time to come.</P>
<P>And here, indeed, I am &s;en&s;ible of difficulties which I almo&s;t de&s;pair of &s;urmounting according to my wi&s;hes. I pay the highe&s;t deference to your
<PB N="171" REF="186">
Lady&s;hip's opinion, which it is extremely painful to me not to concur with; yet, I am &s;o well acquainted with your goodne&s;s, that I pre&s;ume to hope it would not be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to offer &s;uch arguments as might lead you to think with me, that this young creature's chance of happine&s;s &s;eems le&s;s doubtful in retirement, than it would be in the gay and di&s;&s;ipated world: but why &s;hould I perplex your Lady&s;hip with rea&s;oning that can turn to &s;o little account? for, alas! what arguments, what per&s;ua&s;ions can I make u&s;e of, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, to &s;uch a woman as Madame Duval? Her character, and the violence of her di&s;po&s;ition, intimidate me from making the attempt: &s;he is too ignorant for in&s;truction, too ob&s;tinate for entreaty, and too weak for rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I will not, therefore, enter into a conte&s;t from which I have nothing to expect but altercation and impertinence. As &s;oon would I di&s;cu&s;s the effect of &s;ound with the deaf, or the nature of colours with the blind, as aim at illuminating with conviction a mind &s;o warped by prejudice, &s;o much the &s;lave of unruly and illiberal pa&s;&s;ions. Unu&s;ed as &s;he is to controul, per&s;ua&s;ion would but harden, and oppo&s;ition incen&s;e her. I yield therefore, to the nece&s;&s;ity which compels my reluctant acqui|e&s;cence, and &s;hall now turn all my thoughts upon con&s;idering of &s;uch methods for the conducting this enterprize as may be mo&s;t conducive to the hap|pine&s;s of my child, and lea&s;t liable to wound her &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The law-&s;uit, therefore, I wholly and ab&s;olute|ly di&s;approve.</P>
<P>Will you, my dear Madam, forgive the free|dom of an old man, if I own my&s;elf greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that you could, even for a moment, li&s;ten
<PB N="172" REF="187">
to a plan &s;o violent, &s;o public, &s;o totally repugnant to all female delicacy? I am &s;atisfied your Lady|&s;hip has not weighed this project. There was a time, indeed, when, to a&s;&s;ert the innocence of Lady Belmont, and to blazon to the world the <HI>wrongs,</HI> not <HI>guilt,</HI> by which &s;he &s;uffered, I pro|po&s;ed, nay attempted, a &s;imilar plan: but then, all a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encouragement was denied. How cruel to the remembrance I bear of her woes, is this tardy re&s;entment of Madame Duval! She was deaf to the voice of Nature, though &s;he has hearkened to that of Ambition.</P>
<P>Never can I con&s;ent to have this dear and timid girl brought forward to the notice of the world by &s;uch a method; a method which will &s;ubject her to all the impertinence of curio&s;ity, the &s;neers of conjecture, and the &s;tings of ridicule. And for what!&mdash;the attainment of wealth, which &s;he does not want, and the gratification of vanity, which &s;he does not &s;eel.&mdash;A child to appear again&s;t a father!&mdash;no, Madam, old and infirm as I am, I would even yet &s;ooner convey her my&s;elf to &s;ome remote part of the world, though I were &s;ure of dying in the expedition.</P>
<P>Far different had been the motives which would have &s;timulated her unhappy mother to &s;uch a proceeding; all her felicity in this world was irre|trievably lo&s;t; her life was become a burthen to her, and her fair fame, which &s;he had early been taught to prize above all other things, had receiv|ed a mortal wound: therefore to clear her own ho|nour, and to &s;ecure from blemi&s;h the birth of her child, was all the good which Fortune had re&s;erv|ed her&s;elf the <HI>power</HI> of be&s;towing. But even this la&s;t con&s;olation was with-held from her!</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="188">
Let milder mea&s;ures be adopted; and&mdash;&s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o,&mdash;let application be made to Sir John Belmont; but as to a law-&s;uit, I hope, upon this &s;ubject, never more to hear it mentioned.</P>
<P>With Madame Duval, all pleas of delicacy would be ineffectual; her &s;cheme mu&s;t be oppo&s;ed by arguments better &s;uited to her under&s;tanding. I will not, therefore, talk of its impropriety, but endeavour to prove its inutility. Have the good|ne&s;s, then, to tell her, that her own intentions would be fru&s;trated by her plan, &s;ince, &s;hould the law-&s;uit be commenced, and even &s;hould the cau&s;e be gained, Sir John Belmont would &s;till have it in his power, and, if irritated, no doubt in his in|clination, to cut off her grand-daughter with a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>She cannot do better, her&s;elf, than to remain quiet and inactive in the affair: the long and mu|tual animo&s;ity between her and Sir John, will make her interference merely productive of debates and ill-will. Neither would I have Evelina ap|pear till &s;ummoned. And as to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t wholly decline <HI>acting,</HI> though I will, with unwea|ried zeal, devote all my thoughts to giving coun|&s;el: but, in truth, I have neither inclination nor &s;pirits adequate to engaging per&s;onally with this man.</P>
<P>My opinion is, that he would pay more re&s;pect to a letter from your Lady&s;hip upon this &s;ubject, than from any other per&s;on. I therefore advi&s;e and hope, that you will your&s;elf take the trouble of writing to him, in order to open the affair. When he &s;hall be inclined to &s;ee Evelina, I have for him a po&s;thumous letter, which his much-injured lady left to be pre&s;ented to him, if ever &s;uch a meeting &s;hould take place.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="189">
The views of the Branghtons, in &s;ugge&s;ting this &s;cheme, are obviou&s;ly intere&s;ted; they hope, by &s;ecuring to Evelina the fortune of her father, to induce Madame Duval to &s;ettle her own upon them&s;elves. In this, however, they would proba|bly be mi&s;taken, for little minds have ever a pro|pen&s;ity to be&s;tow their wealth upon tho&s;e who are already in affluence, and therefore, the le&s;s her grand-child requires her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the more gladly &s;he will give it.</P>
<P>I have but one thing more to add, from which, however, I can by no means recede: my word &s;o &s;olemnly given to Lady Belmont, that her child &s;hould never be owned but with her&s;elf, mu&s;t be inviolably adhered to.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will, doubtle&s;s, be &s;urpri&s;ed at receiving a letter from one who had for &s;o &s;hort a period the honour of your acquaintance, and that at &s;o great a di&s;tance of time; but the motive which has in|duced me to take this liberty, is of &s;o delicate a nature, that were I to commence making apologies
<PB N="177" REF="192">
for my officiou&s;ne&s;s, I fear my letter would be too long for your patience.</P>
<P>You have, probably, already conjectured the &s;ubject upon which I mean to treat. My regard for Mr. Evelyn and his amiable daughter, was well known to you: nor can I ever cea&s;e to be intere&s;ted in whatever belongs to their memory or family.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own my&s;elf &s;omewhat di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in what manner to introduce the purport of my writing; yet, as I think that, in affairs of this kind, frank|ne&s;s is the fir&s;t requi&s;ite to a good under&s;tanding be|tween the parties concerned, I will neither torment you nor my&s;elf with punctilious ceremonies, but proceed in&s;tantly and openly to the bu&s;ine&s;s which occa&s;ions my giving you this trouble.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, it would be &s;uperfluous to tell you, that your child re&s;ides &s;till in Dor&s;et&s;hire, and is &s;till under the protection of the Reverend Mr. Villars, in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he was born: for, though no enquiries concerning her have reached his ears, or mine, I can never &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible you have forborne to make them. It only remains, therefore, to tell you, that your daughter is now grown up; that &s;he has been educated with the utmo&s;t care, and the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and that &s;he is now a mo&s;t de&s;erving, accompli&s;hed, and amia|ble young woman.</P>
<P>Whatever may be your view for her future de&s;tination in life, it &s;eems time to declare it. She is greatly admired, and, I doubt not, will be very much &s;ought after: it is proper, therefore, that her future expectations, and your plea&s;ure concern|ing her, &s;hould be made known.</P>
<P>Believe me, Sir, &s;he merits your utmo&s;t atten|tion and regard. You could not &s;ee and know her, and remain unmoved by tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of affec|tion
<PB N="178" REF="193">
which belong to &s;o near and tender a relation|&s;hip. She is the lovely re&s;emblance of her lovely mother;&mdash;pardon me, Sir, that I mention that unfortunate lady, but I think it behoves me, upon this occa&s;ion, to &s;hew the e&s;teem I felt for her; allow me, therefore, to &s;ay, and be not offended at my freedom, that the memory of that excellent lady has but too long remained under the a&s;per&s;ions of calumny; &s;urely it is time to vindicate her fame!&mdash;and how can that be done in a manner more eligible, more grateful to her friends, or more honourable to your&s;elf, than by openly re|ceiving as your child, <HI>the daughter of the late Lady Belmont?</HI></P>
<P>The venerable man who has had the care of her education, de&s;erves your warme&s;t acknowledgments, for the unremitting pains he has taken, and atten|tion he has &s;hewn in the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t. Indeed &s;he has been peculiarly fortunate in meeting with &s;uch a friend and guardian: a more worthy man, or one who&s;e character &s;eems nearer to per|fection, does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Permit me to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;he will amply repay whatever regard and favour you may hereaf|ter &s;hew her, by the comfort and happine&s;s you cannot fail to find in her affection and duty. To be owned <HI>properly</HI> by you, is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart; and I am &s;ure, that to merit your approba|tion will be the fir&s;t &s;tudy of her life.</P>

<P>OUR hou&s;e has been enlivened to-day, by the arrival of a London vi&s;itor; and the nece&s;&s;ity I have been under of concealing the unea&s;ine&s;s of my mind, has made me exert my&s;elf &s;o effectu|ally, that I even think it is really dimini&s;hed; or, at lea&s;t, my thoughts are not &s;o totally, &s;o very anxiou&s;ly occupied by one only &s;ubject, as they lately were.</P>
<P>I was &s;trolling this morning with Mi&s;s Mirvan, down a lane about a mile from the grove, when we heard the trampling of hor&s;es; and, fearing the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age, we were turning ha&s;tily back, but &s;topped upon hearing a voice call out, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Ladies, don't be frightened, for I will walk my hor&s;e."</Q> We turned again, and then &s;aw Sir Clement Willoughby. He di&s;mounted, and approaching us, with the reins in his hand, pre&s;ently recollected us. <Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven,"</Q> cried he, with his u&s;ual quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"do I &s;ee Mi&s;s Anville?&mdash;and you, too, Mi&s;s Mirvan?"</Q></P>
<P>He immediately ordered his &s;ervant to take charge of his hor&s;e, and then, advancing to us, took a hand of each, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, and &s;aid a thou&s;and fine things concerning his good fortune, our improved looks, and the charms of the country, when inhabited by <HI>&s;uch</HI> rural deities. <Q REND="inline">"The town, Ladies, has lan|gui&s;hed &s;ince your ab&s;ence,&mdash;or, at lea&s;t, I have &s;o much langui&s;hed my&s;elf, as to be ab&s;olutely
<PB N="180" REF="195">
in&s;en&s;ible to all it had to offer. One refre&s;hing breeze, &s;uch as I now enjoy, awakens me to new vigour, life, and &s;pirit. But I never before had the good luck to &s;ee the country in &s;uch perfection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has not almo&s;t every body left town, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Mirvan.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am a&s;hamed to an&s;wer you, Madam&mdash;but indeed it is as full as ever, and will continue &s;o, till after the birth-day. However, you ladies, were &s;o little &s;een, that there were but few who know what it has lo&s;t. For my own part, I felt it too &s;en&s;ibly, to be able to endure the place any lon|ger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is there any body remaining there, that we were acquainted with?"</Q> cried I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, Ma'am."</Q> And then he named two or three per&s;ons we had &s;een when with him; but he did not mention Lord Orville, and I would not a&s;k him, le&s;t he &s;hould think me curious. Perhaps, if he &s;tays here &s;ome time, he may &s;peak of him by accident.</P>
<P>He was proceeding in this complimentary &s;tyle, when we were met by the Captain; who no &s;ooner perceived Sir Clement, than he ha&s;tened up to him, gave him a hearty &s;hake of the hand, a cordial &s;lap on the back, and &s;ome other equally gentle tokens of &s;atisfaction, a&s;&s;uring him of his great joy at his vi&s;it, and declaring he was as glad to &s;ee him as if he had been a me&s;&s;enger who brought news that a French &s;hip was &s;unk. Sir Clement, on the other &s;ide, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with equal warmth, and prote&s;ted he had been &s;o eager to pay his re|&s;pects to Captain Mirvan, that he had left Lon|don in its full lu&s;tre, and a thou&s;and engage|ments
<PB N="181" REF="196">
unan&s;wered, merely to give him&s;elf that plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall have rare &s;port,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"for do you know the old French-woman is among us? 'Fore George, I have &s;carce made any u&s;e of her yet, by rea&s;on I have had no|body with me that could enjoy a joke: how&s;om|ever, it &s;hall go hard but we'll have &s;ome diver|&s;ion now."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement very much approved of the pro|po&s;al; and we then went into the hou&s;e, where he had a very grave reception from Mrs. Mirvan, who is by no means plea&s;ed with his vi&s;it, and a look of much di&s;content from Madame Duval, who &s;aid to me, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"I'd as &s;oon have &s;een Old Nick as that man, for he's the mo&s;t imper|tinente&s;t per&s;on in the world, and is n't never of my &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain is now actually occupied in con|triving &s;ome &s;cheme which, he &s;ays, is <HI>to play the old Dowager off;</HI> and &s;o eager and delighted is he at the idea, that he can &s;carcely con&s;train his raptures &s;ufficiently to conceal his de&s;ign, even from her&s;elf.

<P>THE Captain's operations are begun,&mdash;and, I hope, ended; for indeed poor Madame Duval has already but too much rea&s;on to regret Sir Cle|ment's vi&s;it to Howard Grove.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning, during breakfa&s;t, as the Captain was reading the news-paper, Sir Clement &s;uddenly begged to look at it, &s;aying he wanted to know if there was any account of a tran&s;action, at which he had been pre&s;ent the evening before his journey thither, concerning a poor Frenchman, who had got into a &s;crape which might co&s;t him his life.</P>
<P>The Captain demanded particulars; and then Sir Clement told him a long &s;tory, of being with a party of country friends, at the Tower, and hearing a man call out for mercy in French; and that, when he enquired into the occa&s;ion of his di&s;|tre&s;s, he was informed, that he had been taken up upon &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices again&s;t the government. <Q REND="inline">"The poor fellow,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"no &s;ooner found that I &s;poke French, than he be&s;ought me to hear him, prote&s;ting that he had no evil de&s;igns; that he had been but a &s;hort time in England, and only waited the return of a Lady from the country, to quit it for ever."</Q></P>
<P>Madame Duval changed colour, and li&s;tened with the utmo&s;t attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, though I by no means approve of &s;o many foreigners continually flocking into our coun|try,"</Q>

added he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"yet I could not help pitying the poor wretch, becau&s;e he did not know enough of Engli&s;h to make his defence: however, I found it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, for the mob would not &s;uffer me to interfere.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, did they duck him?"</Q> &s;aid the Captain.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Something of that &s;ort,"</Q> an&s;wered he.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So much the better! &s;o much the better!"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"an impudent French puppy!&mdash;I'll bet you what you will he was a ra&s;cal. I only wi&s;h all his countrymen were &s;erved the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h you had been in his place, with all my &s;oul!"</Q> cried Madame Duval, warmly;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"but pray, Sir, did n't nobody know who this poor gentleman was?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I did hear his name &s;poke,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"but I cannot recollect it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was n't,&mdash;it was n't&mdash;Du Bois?"</Q> &s;tam|mered out Madame Duval.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The very name!"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"yes, Du Bois, I remember it now."</Q></P>
<P>Madame Duval's cup fell from her hand, as &s;he repeated <Q REND="inline">"Du Bois! Mon&s;ieur Du Bois, did you &s;ay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Du Bois! why that's <HI>my</HI> friend,</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"that's <HI>Mon&s;ieur Slippery,</HI> i'n't it?&mdash;Why he's plaguy fond of &s;ou&s;ing work; how&s;om|ever, I'll be &s;worn they gave him his fill of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And I'll be &s;worn,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"that you're a&mdash;but I don't believe nothing about it, &s;o you need n't be &s;o overjoyed, for I dare &s;ay it was no more Mon&s;ieur Du Bois than I am."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="199">
<Q REND="inline">"I thought at the time,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, very gravely, <Q REND="inline">"that I had &s;een the gentleman be|fore, and now I recollect, I think it was in com|pany with you, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With <HI>me,</HI> Sir!"</Q> cried Madame Duval.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Say you &s;o!"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"why then, it mu&s;t be he, as &s;ure as you're alive!&mdash;Well but, my good friend, what will they do with poor Mon|&s;ieur?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is difficult to &s;ay,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Clement, very thoughtfully, <Q REND="inline">"but, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that if he has not good friends to appear for him, he will be in a very unplea&s;ant &s;ituation; for the&s;e are &s;erious &s;ort of affairs.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, do you think they'll hang him?"</Q> de|manded the Captain.</P>
<P>Sir Clement &s;hook his head, but made no an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>Madame Duval could no longer contain her agitation; &s;he &s;tarted from her chair, repeating, with a voice half choaked, <Q REND="inline">"Hang him!&mdash;they can't,&mdash;they &s;ha'n't&mdash;let them at their peril!&mdash;however, 'tis all fal&s;e, and I won't believe a word of it;&mdash;but I'll go to town this very moment, and &s;ee M. Du Bois my&s;elf;&mdash;I won't wait for no|thing."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan begged her not to be alarmed; but &s;he flew out of the room, and up &s;tairs into her own apartment. Lady Howard blamed both the gentle|men for having been &s;o abrupt, and followed her. I would have accompanied her, but the Captain &s;topped me; and, having fir&s;t laughed very hear|tily, &s;aid he was going to read his commi&s;&s;ion to his &s;hip's company.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, do you &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"as to Lady Howard, I &s;ha'n't pretend for to enli&s;t her into
<PB N="185" REF="200">
my &s;ervice, and &s;o I &s;hall e'en leave her to make it out as well as &s;he can; but as to all you, I ex|pect obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to orders; I am now upon a hazardous expedition, having undertaken to convoy a crazy ve&s;&s;el to the &s;hore of Mortifi|cation; &s;o, d'ye &s;ee, if any of you have any thing to propo&s;e, that will forward the enterprize,&mdash;why &s;peak and welcome; but if any of you, that are of my cho&s;en crew, capitulate, or enter into any treaty with the enemy,&mdash;I &s;hall look upon you as mutinying, and turn you adrift."</Q></P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this harangue, which was inter|larded with many expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ea-phra&s;es, that I cannot recollect, he gave Sir Clement a wink of intelligence, and left us to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Indeed, notwith&s;tanding the attempts I &s;o fre|quently make of writing &s;ome of the Captain's conver&s;ation, I can only give you a faint idea of his language; for almo&s;t every other word he ut|ters is accompanied by an oath, which, I am &s;ure, would be as unplea&s;ant for you to read, as for me to write. And, be&s;ides, he makes u&s;e of a thou|&s;and &s;ea-terms, which are to me quite unintel|ligible.</P>
<P>Poor Madame Duval &s;ent to enquire at all pro|bable places, whether &s;he could be conveyed to town in any &s;tage-coach; but the Captain's &s;er|vant brought her for an&s;wer, that no London &s;tage would pa&s;s near Howard Grove till to-day. She then &s;ent to order a chai&s;e; but was &s;oon a&s;|&s;ured that no hor&s;es could be procured. She was &s;o much inflamed by the&s;e di&s;appointments, that &s;he threatened to &s;et out for town on foot, and it was with difficulty that Lady Howard di&s;&s;uaded her from this mad &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="201">
The whole morning was filled up with the&s;e en|quiries. But, when we were all a&s;&s;embled to din|ner, &s;he endeavoured to appear perfectly uncon|cerned, and repeatedly prote&s;ted that &s;he gave not any credit to the report, as far as it regarded M. Du Bois, being very certain that he was not the per&s;on in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Captain u&s;ed the mo&s;t provoking efforts to convince her that &s;he deceived her&s;elf; while Sir Clement, with more art, though not le&s;s malice, affected to be of her opinion; but, at the &s;ame time that he pretended to relieve her unea&s;ine&s;s, by &s;aying that he doubted not having mi&s;taken the name, he took care to enlarge upon the dan|ger to which the <HI>unknown gentleman</HI> was ex|po&s;ed, and expre&s;&s;ed great concern at his perilous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Dinner was hardly removed, when a letter was delivered to Madame Duval. The moment &s;he had read it, &s;he ha&s;tily demanded from whom it came? <Q REND="inline">"A country boy brought it,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;ervant, <Q REND="inline">"but he would not wait."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Run after him this in&s;tant!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and be &s;ure you bring him back. <HI>Mon Dieu! quel avanture! que ferai-je?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What's the matter? what's the matter?"</Q> &s;aid the Captain.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why nothing,&mdash;nothing's the matter. <HI>O mon Dieu!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>And &s;he ro&s;e, and walked about the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what&mdash;has Mon&s;ieur &s;ent to you?"</Q> continued the Captain: <Q REND="inline">"is that there letter from him?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;it i'n't;&mdash;be&s;ides, if it is, it's nothing to you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="202">
<Q REND="inline">"O then, I'm &s;ure it is! Pray now, Madame, don't be &s;o clo&s;e; come, tell us all about it,&mdash;what does he &s;ay? how did he reli&s;h the hor&s;e|pond?&mdash;which did he find be&s;t, &s;ou&s;ing <HI>&s;ingle</HI> or <HI>double?</HI>&mdash;'Fore George, 'twas plaguy unlucky you was not with him!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's no &s;uch a thing, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, very angrily, <Q REND="inline">"and if you're &s;o very fond of a hor&s;e|pond, I wi&s;h you'd put your&s;elf into one, and not be always a thinking about other people's being &s;erved &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>The man then came in, to acquaint her they could not overtake the boy. She &s;colded violently, and was in &s;uch perturbation, that Lady Howard interfered, and begged to know the cau&s;e of her unea&s;ine&s;s, and whether &s;he could a&s;&s;i&s;t her?</P>
<P>Madame Duval ca&s;t her eyes upon the Captain, and Sir Clement, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;peak to her Lady&s;hip, without &s;o many witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> &s;aid the Cap|tain, turning to me, <Q REND="inline">"do you and Molly go into another room, and &s;tay there till Mrs. Duval has opened her mind to us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So you may think, Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but who's fool then? no, no, you need n't trouble your&s;elf to make a ninny of me, neither, for I'm not &s;o ea&s;ily taken in I'll a&s;&s;ure you."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Howard then invited her into the dre&s;&s;ing|room, and I was de&s;ired to attend her.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had &s;hut the door, <Q REND="inline">"O my Lady,"</Q> exclaimed Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"here's the mo&s;t cruelle&s;t thing in the world has happened!&mdash;but that Captain is &s;uch a bea&s;t, I can't &s;ay no|thing before him,&mdash;but it's all true! poor M. Du Bois is tooked up!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="203">
Lady Howard begged her to be comforted, &s;ay|ing that as M. Du Bois was certainly innocent, there could be no doubt of his ability to clear him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, my Lady,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I know he is innocent; and to be &s;ure they'll never be &s;o wicked as to hang him for nothing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly not;"</Q> replied Lady Howa:d, <Q REND="inline">"you have no rea&s;on to be unea&s;y. This is not a coun|try where puni&s;hment is inflicted without proof."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very true, my Lady; but the wor&s;t thing is this; I cannot bear that that fellow, the Cap|tain, &s;hould know about it; for if he does, I &s;ha'n't never hear the la&s;t of it;&mdash;no more won't poor M. Du Bois."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Howard, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hew me the letter, and I will endeavour to advi&s;e you."</Q></P>
<P>The letter was then produced. It was &s;igned by the clerk of a country ju&s;tice; who acquainted her, that a pri&s;oner, then upon trial for &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices again&s;t the government, was ju&s;t upon the point of being committed to jail, but having declared that he was known to her, this clerk had been prevailed upon to write, in order to enquire if &s;he really could &s;peak to the character and family of a Frenchman who called him&s;elf Pierre Du Bois.</P>
<P>When I heard the letter, I was quite amazed at its &s;ucce&s;s. So improbable did it &s;eem, that a fo|reigner &s;hould be taken before a <HI>country</HI> ju&s;tice of peace, for a crime of &s;o dangerous a nature, that I cannot imagine how Madame Duval could be alarmed, even for a moment. But, with all her violence of temper, I &s;ee that &s;he is ea&s;ily fright|ened, and, in fact, more cowardly than many who
<PB N="189" REF="204">
have not half her &s;pirit; and &s;o little does &s;he re|flect upon circum&s;tances, or probability, that &s;he is continually the dupe of her own&mdash;I ought not to &s;ay <HI>ignorance,</HI> but yet, I can think of no other word.</P>
<P>I believe that Lady Howard, from the begin|ning of the tran&s;action, &s;u&s;pected &s;ome contrivance of the Captain, and this letter, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t confirm her &s;u&s;picion: however, though &s;he is not at all plea&s;ed with his frolick, yet &s;he would not hazard the con&s;equence of di&s;covering his de&s;igns: her looks, her manner, and her character, made me draw this conclu&s;ion from her apparent perplex|ity; for not a word did &s;he &s;ay, that implied any doubt of the authenticity of the letter. Indeed there &s;eems to be a &s;ort of tacit agreement between her and the Captain, that &s;he &s;hould not appear to be acquainted with his &s;chemes; by which means &s;he at once avoids quarrels, and &s;upports her dig|nity.</P>
<P>While &s;he was con&s;idering what to propo&s;e, Madame Duval begged to have the u&s;e of her Lady&s;hip's chariot, that &s;he might go immediate|ly to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her friend. Lady Howard politely a&s;&s;ured her that it would be extremely at her &s;ervice; and then Madame Duval be&s;ought her not to own to the Captain what had happened, prote&s;ting that &s;he could not endure he &s;hould know that poor M. Du Bois had met with &s;o un|fortunate an accident. Lady Howard could not help &s;miling, though &s;he readily promi&s;ed not to <HI>inform</HI> the Captain of the affair. As to me, &s;he de&s;ired my attendance; which I was by no means rejoiced at, as I was certain &s;he was going upon a fruitle&s;s errand.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="205">
I was then commi&s;&s;ioned to order the chariot.</P>
<P>At the foot of the &s;tairs I met the captain, who was mo&s;t impatiently waiting the re&s;ult of the conference. In an in&s;tant we were joined by Sir Clement. A thou&s;and enquiries were then made concerning Madame Duval's opinion of the letter, and her intentions upon it: and when I would have left them, Sir Clement, pretending equal eagerne&s;s with the Captain, caught my hand, and repeatedly detained me, to a&s;k &s;ome frivolous que&s;tion, to the an&s;wer of which he mu&s;t be to|tally indifferent. At length, however, I broke from them; they retired into the parlour, and I executed my commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The carriage was &s;oon ready, and Madame Duval, having begged Lady Howard to &s;ay &s;he was not well, &s;tole &s;oftly down &s;tairs, de&s;iring me to follow her. The chariot was ordered at the garden door; and when we were &s;eated, &s;he told the man, according to the clerk's directions, to drive to Mr. Ju&s;tice Tyrell's, a&s;king, at the &s;ame time, how many miles off he lived?</P>
<P>I expected he would have an&s;wered that he knew of no &s;uch per&s;on; but, to my great &s;urprize, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why 'Squire Tyrell lives about nine miles beyond the park."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Drive fa&s;t, then,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and you &s;ha'n't be no wor&s;e for it."</Q></P>
<P>During our ride, which was extremely tedious, &s;he tormented her&s;elf with a thou&s;and fears for M. Du Bois' &s;afety; and piqued her&s;elf very much upon having e&s;caped un&s;een by the Captain, not only that &s;he avoided his triumph, but becau&s;e &s;he knew him to be &s;o much M. Du Bois' enemy, that &s;he was &s;ure he would prejudice the Ju&s;tice again&s;t him, and endeavour to take away his life. For
<PB N="191" REF="206">
my part, I was quite a&s;hamed of being engaged in &s;o ridiculous an affair, and could only think of the ab&s;urd appearance we &s;hould make upon our arrival at Mr. Tyrell's.</P>
<P>When we had been out near two hours, and expected every moment to &s;top at the place of our de&s;tination, I ob&s;erved that Lady Howard's &s;er|vant, who attended us on hor&s;eback, rode on for|ward till he was out of &s;ight, and &s;oon after re|turning, came up to the chariot-window, and de|livering a note to Madame Duval, &s;aid he had met a boy, who was ju&s;t coming with it to How|ard Grove, from the clerk of Mr. Tyrell.</P>
<P>While &s;he was reading it, he rode round to the other window, and, making a &s;ign for &s;ecrecy, put into my hand a &s;lip of paper, on which was written, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever happens, be not alarmed,&mdash;for <HI>you</HI> are &s;afe,&mdash;though you endanger all man|kind!"</Q></P>
<P>I readily imagined that Sir Clement mu&s;t be the author of this note, which prepared me to expect &s;ome di&s;agreeable adventure: but I had no time to ponder upon it, for Madame Duval had no &s;ooner read her own letter, than, in an angry tone of voice, &s;he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Why now what a thing is this! here we're come all this way for nothing!"</Q></P>
<P>She then gave me the note, which informed her, that &s;he need not trouble her&s;elf to go to Mr. Tyrell's, as the pri&s;oner had had the addre&s;s to e&s;cape. I congratulated her upon this fortunate incident; but &s;he was &s;o much concerned at having rode &s;o far in vain, that &s;he &s;eemed le&s;s plea&s;ed than provoked. However, &s;he ordered the man to make what ha&s;te he could home, as &s;he hoped,
<PB N="192" REF="207">
at lea&s;t to return before the Captain &s;hould &s;u&s;pect what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The carriage turned about, and we journeyed &s;o quietly for near an hour, that I began to flatter my&s;elf we &s;hould be &s;uffered to proceed to How|ard Grove without further mole&s;tation, when, &s;uddenly, the footman called out, <Q REND="inline">"John, are we going right?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I a'n't &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid the coachman, <Q REND="inline">"but I'm afraid we turned wrong."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sirrah?"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"why if you lo&s;e your way we &s;hall be all in the dark."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think we &s;hould turn to the left,"</Q> &s;aid the footman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To the left!"</Q> an&s;wered the other, <Q REND="inline">"No, no, I'm partly &s;ure we &s;hould turn to the right."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You had better make &s;ome enquiry,"</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"we're in a fine hole, here!&mdash;they neither of them know more than the po&s;t. However, I'll tell my Lady, as &s;ure as you're born, &s;o you'd better find the way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let's try this lane,"</Q> &s;aid the footman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid the coachman, <Q REND="inline">"that's the road to Canterbury; we had be&s;t go &s;traight on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why that's the direct London road,"</Q> return|ed the footman, <Q REND="inline">"and will lead us twenty miles about."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"why they won't go one way nor t'other! and, now we're come all this jaunt for nothing, I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;ha'n't get home to-night!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let's go back to the public-hou&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid the footman, <Q REND="inline">"and a&s;k for a guide."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="208">
<Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid the other, <Q REND="inline">"if we &s;tay here a few minutes, &s;omebody or other will pa&s;s by; and the hor&s;es are almo&s;t knocked up already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I prote&s;t,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"I'd give a guinea to &s;ee them &s;ots both hor&s;e-whipped! As &s;ure as I'm alive, they're drunk! Ten to one but they'll overturn us next!"</Q></P>
<P>After much debating, they, at length, agreed to go on, till we came to &s;ome inn, or met with a pa&s;&s;enger who could direct us. We &s;oon arrived at a &s;mall farm-hou&s;e, and the footman alighted, and went into it.</P>
<P>In a few minutes he returned, and told us we might proceed, for that he had procured a directi|on; <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"it &s;eems there are &s;ome thieves hereabouts; and &s;o the be&s;t way will be for you to leave your watches and pur&s;es with the farmer, who I know very well, and who is an ho|ne&s;t man, and a tenant of my Lady's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thieves!"</Q> cried Madame Duval, looking agha&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"the Lord help us!&mdash;I've no doubt but we &s;hall be all murdered!"</Q></P>
<P>The farmer came to us, and we gave him all we were worth, and the &s;ervants followed our ex|ample. We then proceeded, and Madame Duval's anger &s;o entirely &s;ub&s;ided, that, in the milde&s;t manner imaginable, &s;he intreated them to make ha&s;te, and promi&s;ed to tell their Lady how diligent and obliging they had been. She perpetually &s;top|ped them, to a&s;k if they apprehended any danger; and was, at length, &s;o much overpowered by her fears, that &s;he made the footman fa&s;ten his hor&s;e to the back of the carriage, and then come and &s;eat him&s;elf within it. My endeavours to encou|rage her were fruitle&s;s; &s;he &s;at in the middle, held the man by the arm, and prote&s;ted that if he did
<PB N="194" REF="209">
but &s;ave her life, &s;he would make his fortune. Her unea&s;ine&s;s gave me much concern, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I forbore to acquaint her that &s;he was impo&s;ed upon; but the mutual fear of the Captain's re&s;entment to me, and of her own to him, neither of which would have any moderation, deterred me. As to the footman, he was evidently in torture from re&s;training his laughter, and I ob|&s;erved that he was frequently obliged to make hor|rid grimaces, from pretended fear, in order to con|ceal his ri&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after, <Q REND="inline">"The robbers are coming!"</Q> cried the coachman.</P>
<P>The footman opened the door, and jumped out of the chariot.</P>
<P>Madame Duval gave a loud &s;cream.</P>
<P>I could no longer pre&s;erve my &s;ilence, <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, my dear Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">don't be alarmed,&mdash;you are in no danger&mdash;you are quite &s;afe, there is nothing but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here the chariot was &s;topped, by two men in ma&s;ks, who, at each &s;ide, put in their hands, as if for our pur&s;es. Madame Duval &s;unk to the bot|tom of the chariot, and implored their mercy. I &s;hrieked involuntarily, although prepared for the attack: one of them held me fa&s;t, while the other tore poor Madame Duval out of the carriage, in &s;pite of her cries, threats, and re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I was really frightened, and trembled exceed|ingly. <Q REND="inline">"My angel!"</Q> cried the man who held me, <Q REND="inline">"you cannot &s;urely be alarmed,&mdash;do you not know me?&mdash;I &s;hall hold my&s;elf in eternal abhor|rence, if I have really terrified you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement, you have,"</Q> cried I,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"but, for Heaven's &s;ake, where is Madame Du|val?&mdash;why is &s;he forced away?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="210">
<Q REND="inline">"She is perfectly &s;afe; the Captain has her in charge: but &s;uffer me now, my adored Mi&s;s An|ville, to take the only opportunity that is allowed me, to &s;peak upon another, a much dearer, much &s;weeter &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P>And then he ha&s;tily came into the chariot, and &s;eated him&s;elf next to me.

<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;cheme was the Captain's; I even oppo|&s;ed it: though, I own, I could not refu&s;e my&s;elf the &s;o-long-wi&s;hed-for happine&s;s, of &s;peaking to you once more, without &s;o many of&mdash;your <HI>friends</HI> to watch me.

<P>I was &s;urprized at the freedom of this reque&s;t; but while I he&s;itated how to an&s;wer it, the other ma&s;k came up to the chariot door, and in a voice almo&s;t &s;tifled with laughter, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I've done for her! the old buck is &s;afe;&mdash;but we mu&s;t &s;heer off directly, or we &s;hall be all a-ground."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="212">
Sir Clement in&s;tantly left me, mounted his hor&s;e, and rode off. The Captain, having given &s;ome directions to the &s;ervants, followed him.</P>
<P>I was both unea&s;y and impatient to know the fate of Madame Duval, and immediately got out of the chariot to &s;eek her. I de&s;ired the footman to &s;hew me which was &s;he was gone; he pointed with his finger, by way of an&s;wer, and I &s;aw that he dared not tru&s;t his voice to make any other. I walked on, a very quick pace, and &s;oon, to my great con&s;ternation, perceived the poor lady, &s;eated upright in a ditch. I flew to her, with unfeigned concern at her &s;ituation. She was &s;obbing, nay, almo&s;t roaring, and in the utmo&s;t agony of rage and terror. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me &s;he redoubled her cries, but her voice was &s;o broken, I could not un|der&s;tand a word &s;he &s;aid. I was &s;o much &s;hocked, that it was with difficulty I forbore exclaiming again&s;t the cruelty of the Captain, for thus wan|tonly ill-treating her; and I could not forgive my|&s;elf for having pa&s;&s;ively &s;uffered the deception. I u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavours to comfort her, a&s;&s;uring her of our pre&s;ent &s;afety, and begging her to ri&s;e, and return to the chariot.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t bur&s;ting with pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he pointed to her feet, and with frightful violence, &s;he actually beat the ground with her hands.</P>
<P>I then &s;aw, that her feet were tied together with a &s;trong rope, which was fa&s;tened to the upper branch of a tree, even with an hedge which ran along the ditch where &s;he &s;at. I endeavoured to untie the knot, but &s;oon &s;ound it was infinitely be|yond my &s;trength. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to the footman; but being very unwilling to add to his mirth, by the &s;ight of Madame Duval's &s;ituation, I de&s;ired him to lend me a knife; I
<PB N="198" REF="213">
returned with it, and cut the rope. Her feet were &s;oon di&s;entangled, and then, though with great dif|ficulty, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to ri&s;e. But what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when, the moment &s;he was up, &s;he hit me a violent &s;lap on the face! I retreated from her with precipitation and dread, and &s;he then loaded me with reproaches, which, though almo&s;t unintelligible, convinced me that &s;he imagined I had voluntarily de&s;erted her; but &s;he &s;eemed not to have the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion that &s;he had not been attacked by real robbers.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much &s;urprized and confounded at the blow, that, for &s;ome time, I &s;uffered her to rave, without making any an&s;wer; but her extreme agi|tation, and real &s;uffering, &s;oon di&s;pelled my an|ger, which all turned into compa&s;&s;ion. I then told her, that I had been forcibly detained from following her, and a&s;&s;ured her of my real &s;orrow at her ill u&s;age.</P>
<P>She began to be &s;omewhat appea&s;ed; and I again entreated her to return to the carriage, or give me leave to order that it &s;hould draw up to the place where we &s;tood. She made no an&s;wer, till I told her, that the longer we remained &s;till, the greater would be the danger of our ride home. Struck with this hint, &s;he &s;uddenly, and with ha&s;ty &s;teps, moved forward.</P>
<P>Her dre&s;s was in &s;uch di&s;order, that I was quite &s;orry to have her figure expo&s;ed to the &s;ervants, who all of them, in imitation of their ma&s;ter, hold her in deri&s;ion: however, the di&s;grace was unavoidable.</P>
<P>The ditch, happily, was almo&s;t quite dry, or &s;he mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;till more &s;everely; yet, &s;o forlorn, &s;o mi&s;erable a figure, I never before &s;aw. Her head-dre&s;s had fallen off; her linen was torn;
<PB N="199" REF="214">
her negligee had not a pin left in it; her petticoats &s;he was obliged to hold on; and her &s;hoes were perpetually &s;lipping off. She was covered with dirt, weeds, and filth, and her face was really horrible, for the pomatum and powder from her head, and the du&s;t from the road, were quite <HI>pa&s;ted</HI> on her &s;kin by her tears, which, with her <HI>rouge,</HI> made &s;o frightful a mixture, that &s;he hardly looked hu|man.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were ready to die with laughter, the moment they &s;aw her; but not all my remon|&s;trances could prevail upon her to get into the car|riage, till &s;he had mo&s;t vehemently reproached them both, for not re&s;cuing her. The footman, fixing his eyes on the ground, as if fearful of again tru&s;ting him&s;elf to look at her, prote&s;ted that the robbers had vowed they would &s;hoot him, if he moved an inch, and that one of them had &s;tay|ed to watch the chariot, while the other carried her off; adding, that the rea&s;on of their behaving &s;o barbarou&s;ly, was to revenge our having &s;ecured our pur&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding her anger, &s;he gave immediate credit to what he &s;aid, and really ima|gined that her want of money had irritated the pretended robbers to treat her with &s;uch cruelty. I determined, therefore, to be carefully upon my guard, not to betray the impo&s;ition, which could now an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e, than occa&s;ioning an irreparable breach between her and the Captain.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were &s;eated in the chariot, &s;he di&s;|covered the lo&s;s which her head had &s;u&s;tained, and called out, <Q REND="inline">"My God! what is become of my hair?&mdash;why the villain has &s;tole all my curls!"</Q></P>
<P>She then ordered the man to run and &s;ee if he could find any of them in the ditch. He went, and pre&s;ently returning, produced a great quantity
<PB N="200" REF="215">
of hair, in &s;uch a na&s;ty condition, that I was amazed &s;he would take it; and the man as he de|livered it to her, found it impo&s;&s;ible to keep his countenance; which &s;he had no &s;ooner ob&s;erved, than all her &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions were again rai&s;ed. She flung the battered curls in his face, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Sirrah, what do you grin for? I wi&s;h you'd been &s;erved &s;o your&s;elf, and you would n't have found it no &s;uch joke: you are the impudente&s;t fellow ever I &s;ee, and if I find you dare grin at me any more, I &s;hall make no ceremony of boxing your ears."</Q></P>
<P>Satisfied with the threat, the man ha&s;tily retired, and we drove on.</P>
<P>Her anger now &s;ub&s;iding into grief, &s;he began mo&s;t &s;orrowfully to lament her ca&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"I believe,</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"never nobody was &s;o unlucky as I am! and &s;o here, becau&s;e I ha'n't had misfortunes enough already, that puppy has made me lo&s;e my curls!&mdash;Why, I can't &s;ee nobody without them:&mdash;only look at me,&mdash;I was never &s;o bad off in my life before. <HI>Pardie,</HI> if I'd know'd as much, I'd have brought two or three &s;ets with me: but I'd never a thought of &s;uch a thing as this."</Q></P>
<P>Finding her now &s;omewhat pacified, I ventured to a&s;k an account of her adventure, which I will endeavour to write in her own words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, child, all this misfortune comes of that puppy making us leave our money behind us; for as &s;oon as the robber &s;ee I did not put nothing in his hands, he lugged me out of the chariot, by main force, and I verily thought he'd have mur|dered me. He was as &s;trong as a lion; I was no more in his hands than a child. But I believe never nobody was &s;o abu&s;ed before, for he dragged me down the road, pulling and hawling me all the way, as if I'd no more feeling than a hor&s;e. I'm &s;ure I
<PB N="201" REF="216">
wi&s;h I could &s;ee that man cut up and quartered alive! however, he'll come to the gallows, that's one good thing. So, as &s;oon as we'd got out of &s;ight of the chariot,&mdash;though he need n't have been afraid, for if he'd beat me to a mummy, tho&s;e cowardly fellows would n't have &s;aid nothing to it.&mdash;So, when I was got there, what does he do, but, all of a &s;udden, he takes me by both the &s;houlders, and he gives me &s;uch a &s;hake!&mdash;<HI>Mon Dieu!</HI> I &s;hall never forget it, if I live to be an hundred. I'm &s;ure I dare &s;ay I'm out of joint all over. And, though I made as much noi&s;e as ever I could, he took no more notice of it than nothing at all, but there he &s;tood, &s;haking me in that man|ner, as if he was doing it for a wager. I'm de|termined, if it co&s;ts me all my fortune, I'll &s;ee that villain hanged. He &s;hall be found out, if there's e're a ju&s;tice in England. So when he had &s;hooked me till he was tired, and I felt all over like a jelly, without &s;aying never a word, he takes and pops me into the ditch! I'm &s;ure I thought he'd have murdered me, as &s;ure as I ever thought any thing in my life, for he kept bumping me about, as if he thought nothing too bad for me. However, I'm re&s;olved I'll never leave my pur&s;e behind me again, the longe&s;t day I have to live. So when he could n't &s;tand over me no longer, he holds out his hands again for my money; but he was as cunning as he could be, for he would n't &s;peak a word, becau&s;e I &s;hould n't &s;wear to his voice; however, that &s;ha'nt &s;ave him, for I'll &s;wear to him any day in the year, if I can but catch him. So, when I told him I had no money, he fell to jerking me again, ju&s;t as if he had but that moment begun! And, after that he got me clo&s;e by a tree, and out of his pocket he pulls a
<PB N="202" REF="217">
great cord!&mdash;It's a wonder I did not &s;woon away, for as &s;ure as you're alive, he was going to hang me to that tree. I &s;creamed like any thing mad, and told him if he would but &s;pare my life, I'd never pro&s;ecute him, nor tell nobody what he'd done to me: &s;o he &s;tood &s;ome time quite in a brown &s;tudy, a thinking what he &s;hould do. And &s;o, after that, he forced me to &s;it down in the ditch, and he tied my feet together, ju&s;t as you &s;ee them, and then, as if he had not done enough, he twitched off my cap, and, without &s;aying no|thing, got on his hor&s;e, and left me in that con|dition, thinking, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I might lie there and peri&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>Though this narrative almo&s;t compelled me to laugh, yet I was really irritated with the Captain, for carrying his love of tormenting,&mdash;<HI>&s;port,</HI> he calls it,&mdash;to &s;uch barbarous and unju&s;tifiable ex|tremes. I con&s;oled and &s;oothed her as well as I was able, and told her that, &s;ince M. Du Bois had e&s;caped, I hoped, when &s;he recovered from her fright, all would end well.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fright, child!"</Q> repeated &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why, that's not half;&mdash;I promi&s;e you, I wi&s;h it was; but here I'm brui&s;ed from top to toe, and it's well if ever I have the right u&s;e of my limbs again. How|ever, I'm glad the villain got nothing but his trouble for his pains. But here the wor&s;t is to come, for I can't go out, becau&s;e I have got no curls, and &s;o he'll be e&s;caped, before I can get to the Ju&s;tice to &s;top him. I'm re&s;olved I'll tell Lady Howard how her man &s;erved me, for if he had'nt made me fling 'em away, I dare &s;ay I could have pinned them up well enough for the country."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps Lady Howard may be able to lend you a cap that will wear without them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="218">
<Q REND="inline">"Lady Howard, indeed! why, do you think I'd wear one of her dowdies? No, I'll promi&s;e you, I &s;ha'nt put on no &s;uch di&s;gui&s;ement. It's the unluckie&s;t thing in the world that I did not make the man pick up the curls again; but he put me in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, I could not think of nothing. I know I can't get none at Howard Grove for love nor money, for of all the &s;tupid places ever I &s;ee, that Howard Grove is the wor&s;t! there's never no getting nothing one wants."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ort of conver&s;ation la&s;ted till we arrived at our journey's end; and then, a new di&s;tre&s;s occurred; Madame Duval was eager to &s;peak to Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan, and to relate her misfortunes, but &s;he could not endure that Sir Clement or the Captain &s;hould &s;ee her in &s;uch di&s;or|der, for &s;he &s;aid they were &s;o ill-natured, that in|&s;tead of pitying her, they would only make a je&s;t of her di&s;a&s;ters. She therefore &s;ent me fir&s;t into the hou&s;e, to wait for an opportunity of their being out of the way, that &s;he might &s;teal up &s;tairs un|ob&s;erved. In this I &s;ucceeded, as the gentlemen thought it mo&s;t prudent not to &s;eem watching for her; though they both contrived to divert them|&s;elves with peeping at her as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>She went immediately to bed, where &s;he had her &s;upper. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan both of them very kindly &s;at with her, and li&s;tened to her tale with compa&s;&s;ionate attention; while Mi&s;s Mirvan and I retired to our own room, where I was very glad to end the troubles of the day in a comfortable conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Captain's raptures, during &s;upper, at the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan, were boundle&s;s. I &s;poke, afterwards, to Mrs. Mirvan, with the openne&s;s which her kindne&s;s encourages, and begged her to
<PB N="204" REF="219">
remon&s;trate with him upon the cruelty of torment|ing Madame Duval &s;o cau&s;ele&s;sly. She promi&s;ed to take the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;tarting the &s;ubject, but &s;aid he was at pre&s;ent, &s;o much elated that he would not li&s;ten to her with any patience. How|ever &s;hould he make any new efforts to mole&s;t her, I can by no means con&s;ent to be pa&s;&s;ive. Had I imagined he would have been &s;o violent, I would have ri&s;ked his anger in her defence much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>She has kept her bed all day, and declares &s;he is almo&s;t brui&s;ed to death.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Sir. What a long letter have I written! I could almo&s;t fancy I &s;ent it you from London!</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV</HEAD>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Howard Grove, <DATE>May 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS in&s;atiable Captain, if left to him&s;elf, would not, I believe, re&s;t, till he had tormented Madame Duval into a fever. He &s;eems to have no de|light but in terrifying or provoking her, and all his thoughts apparently turn upon inventing &s;uch me|thods as may do it mo&s;t effectually.</P>
<P>She had her breakfa&s;t again in bed ye&s;terday morning; but during ours, the Captain with a very &s;ignificant look at Sir Clement, gave us to under&s;tand, that he thought &s;he had now re&s;ted long enough to bear the hard&s;hips of a fre&s;h cam|paign.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="220">
His meaning was obvious, and, therefore, I re|&s;olved to endeavour immediately to put a &s;top to his intended exploits. When breakfa&s;t was over, I followed Mrs. Mirvan out of the parlour, and begged her to lo&s;e no time in pleading the cau&s;e of Madame Duval with the Captain. <Q REND="inline">"My love,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">I have already expo&s;tulated with him; but all I can &s;ay is fruitle&s;s, while his fa|vourite Sir Clement contrives to urge him on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I will go and &s;peak to Sir Clement,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"for I know he will de&s;i&s;t, if I reque&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have a care, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"it is &s;ometimes dangerous to make reque&s;ts to men, who are too de&s;irous of receiving them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well then, my dear Madam, will you give me leave to &s;peak my&s;elf to the Captain?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Willingly; nay, I will accompany you to him."</Q></P>
<P>I thanked her, and we went to &s;eek him. He was walking in the garden with Sir Clement. Mrs. Mirvan mo&s;t obligingly made anopening for my pur|po&s;e, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Mirvan, I have brought a petitioner with me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what's the matter now?"</Q> cried he.</P>
<P>I was fearful of making him angry, and &s;tam|mered very much, when I told him, I hoped he had no new plan for alarming Madame Duval.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>New</HI> plan!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"why, you don't &s;up|po&s;e the <HI>old</HI> one would do again, do you? Not but what it was a very good one, only I doubt &s;he would n't bite."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he has already &s;uf|fered too much, and I hope you will pardon me, if I take the liberty of telling you, that I think it
<PB N="206" REF="221">
my duty to do all in my power to prevent her being again &s;o much terrified."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ullen gloomine&s;s in&s;tantly clouded his face, and, turning &s;hort from me, he &s;aid, I might do as I plea&s;ed, but that I &s;hould much &s;ooner repent than repair my officiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was too much di&s;concerted at this rebuff, to attempt making any an&s;wer, and, finding that Sir Clement warmly e&s;pou&s;ed my cau&s;e, I walked away, and left them to di&s;cu&s;s the point together.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan, who never &s;peaks to the Captain when he is out of humour, was glad to follow me, and, with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s, made a thou&s;and apologies for her hu&s;band's ill-manners.</P>
<P>When I left her, I went to Madame Duval, who was ju&s;t ri&s;en, and employed in examining the cloaths &s;he had on the day of her ill u&s;age.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here's a &s;ight! cried &s;he. Come here, child,&mdash;only look&mdash;<HI>Pardie,</HI> &s;o long as I've lived, I never &s;ee &s;o much before!

Here's the &s;econd negligee I've u&s;ed in this man|ner!&mdash;I am &s;ure I was a fool to put it on, in &s;uch a lone&s;ome place as this; however, if I &s;tay here the&s;e ten years, I'll never put on another good gown, that I'm re&s;olved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you let the maid try if &s;he can iron it out, or clean it, Ma'am?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, &s;he'll only make bad wor&s;e.&mdash;But look here, now, here's a cloak! <HI>Mon Dieu!</HI> why it looks like a di&s;h-clout! Of all the unluckine&s;&s;es that ever I met, this is the wor&s;t! for, do you know, I bought it but the day before I left Paris?&mdash;Be&s;ides, into the bargain, my cap's quite gone; where the villain twitched it, I don't know, but I &s;ee no more of it from that time to this Now you

mu&s;t know this was the becominge&s;t cap I had in the world, for I've never another with pink ribbon in it; and, to tell you the truth, if I had n't thought to have &s;een M.

<P>She then told me, that &s;he had been thinking all night of a contrivance to hinder the Captain's finding out her lo&s;s of curls; which was, having a large gauze handkerchief pinned on her head as a hood, and &s;aying &s;he had the tooth-ach.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To tell you the truth,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I be|lieve that Captain is one of the wor&s;t men in the world; he's always making a joke of me; and as to his being a gentleman, he has no more manners than a bear, for he's always upon the grin when one's in di&s;tre&s;s, and, I declare, I'd rather be done any thing to than laughed at, for, to my mind, it's one or other the di&s;agreeable&s;t thing in the world."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Mirvan, I found, had been endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade her from the de&s;ign &s;he had formed, of having recour&s;e to the law, in order to find out the &s;uppo&s;ed robbers; for &s;he dreads a di&s;covery of the Captain, during Madame Duval's &s;tay at Howard Grove, as it could not fail being productive of in|finite commotion. She has, therefore, taken great pains to &s;hew the inutility of applying to ju&s;tice, unle&s;s &s;he were more able to de&s;cribe the offen|ders again&s;t whom &s;he would appear, and has a&s;|&s;ured her, that as &s;he neither heard their voices, nor &s;aw their faces, &s;he cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;wear to their per&s;ons, or obtain any redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, in telling me this, extremely lamented her hard fate, that &s;he was thus pre|vented
<PB N="208" REF="223">
from revenging her injuries; which, how|ever, &s;he vowed &s;he would not be per&s;uaded to <HI>pocket tamely,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if &s;uch vil|lains as the&s;e are let to have their own way, and nobody takes no notice of their impudence, they'll make no more ado than nothing at all of tying people in ditches, and &s;uch things as that: however, I &s;hall con&s;ult with M. Du Bois, as &s;oon I can ferret out where he's hid him&s;elf. I'm &s;ure I've a right to his advice, for it's all along of his gaping about at the Tower that I've met with the&s;e misfor|tunes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"M. Du Bois, &s;aid I, will, I am &s;ure, be very &s;orry when he hears what has happened."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what good will that do now?&mdash;that won't un&s;poil all my cloaths; I can tell him, I a'n't much obliged to him, though it's no fault of his;&mdash;yet it i'n't the le&s;s provokinger for that. I'm &s;ure, if he had been there, to have &s;een me &s;erved in that manner, and put neck and heels into a ditch, he'd no more have thought it was me, than the Pope of Rome. I'll promi&s;e you, what|ever you may think of it, I &s;ha'n't have no re&s;t, night nor day, till I find out that rogue."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have no doubt, Madam, but you will &s;oon di&s;cover him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI> if I do, I'll hang him, as &s;ure as fate!&mdash;but what's the odde&s;t, is that he &s;hould take &s;uch a '&s;pecial &s;pite again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> above all the re&s;t! it was as much for nothing, as could be, for I don't know what I have done, &s;o particular bad, to be u&s;ed in that manner: I'm &s;ure, I had n't given him no of|fence, as I know of, for I never &s;ee his face all the time; and as to &s;creaming a little, I think it's very hard if one mu&s;t n't do &s;uch a thing as that, when one's put in fear of one's life."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="224">
During this conver&s;ation, &s;he endeavoured to ad|ju&s;t her head-dre&s;s, but could not at all plea&s;e her|&s;elf. Indeed, had I not been pre&s;ent, I &s;hould have thought it impo&s;&s;ible for a woman at her time of life to be &s;o very difficult in regard to dre&s;s. What &s;he may have in view, I cannot imagine, but the labour of the toilette &s;eems the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of her life.</P>
<P>When I left her, in my way down &s;tairs, I met with Sir Clement, who, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;aid he mu&s;t not be denied the honour of a mo|ment's conver&s;ation with me; and then, without waiting for an an&s;wer, he led me to the garden, at the door of which, however, I ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;topping.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed very &s;erious, and &s;aid, in a very grave tone of voice, <Q REND="inline">"At length, Mi&s;s Anville, I flat|ter my&s;elf that I have hit upon an expedient that will oblige you, and therefore, though it is death to my&s;elf, I will put it in practice."</Q></P>
<P>I begged him to explain him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;aw your de&s;ire of &s;aving Madame Duval, and &s;carce could I refrain giving the brutal Captain my real opinion of his &s;avage conduct; but I am unwilling to quarrel with him, le&s;t I &s;hould be de|nied entrance into a hou&s;e which you inhabit: I have been endeavouring to prevail with him to give up his ab&s;urd new &s;cheme, but I find him im|penetrable;&mdash;I have therefore determined to make a pretence for &s;uddenly leaving this place, dear as it is to me, and containing all I mo&s;t admire and adore;&mdash;and I will &s;tay in town till the violence of this boobyi&s;h humour is abated."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;&s;opped; but I was &s;ilent, for I knew not what I ought to &s;ay. He took my hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"And mu&s;t I, then,
<PB N="210" REF="225">
Mi&s;s Anville, mu&s;t I quit you&mdash;&s;acrifice voluntarily my greate&s;t felicity,&mdash;and yet not be honoured with one word, one look of approbation?"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>I withdrew my hand, and &s;aid, with a half laugh, <Q REND="inline">"You know &s;o well, Sir Clement, the value of the favours you confer, that it would be &s;uperflu|ous for me to point it out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Charming, charming girl! how does your wit, your under&s;tanding ri&s;e upon me daily! and mu&s;t I, can I part with you?&mdash;will no other me|thod&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir, do you &s;o &s;oon repent the good office you had planned for Madame Duval?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Madame Duval!&mdash;cruel creature, and will you not even &s;uffer me to place to your account the &s;acrifice I am about to make?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t place it, Sir, to what account you plea&s;e; but I am too much in ha&s;te now to &s;tay here any longer."</Q></P>
<P>And then I would have left him, but he held me, and, rather impatiently, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If, then, I cannot be &s;o happy as to oblige <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Anville, you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;hould I &s;eek to oblige my&s;elf. If my &s;cheme is not honoured with your approbation, for which alone it was formed, why &s;hould I, to my own infinite di&s;&s;atisfaction, pur|&s;ue it?"</Q></P>
<P>We were then, for a few minutes, both &s;ilent; I was really unwilling he &s;hould give up a plan, which would &s;o effectually break into the Captain's de&s;igns, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ave me the pain of di&s;obliging him; and I &s;hould in&s;tantly and thankfully have accepted his offered civility, had not Mrs. Mirvan's caution made me fearful. How|ever, when he pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;peak, I &s;aid, in an ironical voice, <Q REND="inline">"I had thought, Sir, that the very
<PB N="211" REF="226">
&s;trong &s;en&s;e you have your&s;elf of the favour you propo&s;e to me, would &s;ufficiently have repaid you, but, as I was mi&s;taken, I mu&s;t thank you my&s;elf. And now,"</Q> making a low courte&s;y, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, Sir, you are &s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lovelie&s;t of thy &s;ex&mdash;"</Q> he began, but I for|ced my&s;elf from him, and ran up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mi&s;s Mirvan told me that Sir Cle|ment had ju&s;t received a letter, which obliged him in&s;tantly to leave the Grove, and that he had actually ordered a chai&s;e. I then acquainted her with the real &s;tate of the affair. Indeed, I con|ceal nothing from her, &s;he is &s;o gentle and &s;weet|tempered, that it gives me great plea&s;ure to place an entire confidence in her.</P>
<P>At dinner, I mu&s;t own, we all mi&s;&s;ed him; for though the flightine&s;s of his behaviour to me, when we are by our&s;elves, is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, yet, in large companies, and general conver&s;ation, he is ex|tremely entertaining and agreeable. As to the Captain, he has been &s;o much chagrined at his de|parture, that he has &s;carce &s;poken a word &s;ince he went: but Madame Duval, who made her fir&s;t pub|lic appearance &s;ince her accident, was quite in rap|tures that &s;he e&s;caped &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>The money which we left at the farm-hou&s;e, has been returned to us. What pains the Captain mu&s;t have taken to arrange and manage the adven|tures which he cho&s;e we &s;hould meet with! Yet he mu&s;t certainly be di&s;covered, for Madame Du|val is already very much perplexed, at having re|ceived a letter this morning from M. Du Bois, in which he makes no mention of his impri&s;onment. However, &s;he has &s;o little &s;u&s;picion, that &s;he im|putes his &s;ilence upon the &s;ubject, to his fears that the letter might be intercepted.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="227">
Not one opportunity could I meet with, while Sir Clement was here, to enquire after his friend Lord Orville: but I think it was &s;trange he &s;hould never mention him una&s;ked. Indeed, I rather won|der that Mrs. Mirvan her&s;elf did not introduce the &s;ubject, for &s;he always &s;eemed particularly atten|tive to him.</P>
<P>And now, once more, all my thoughts involun|tarily turn upon the letter I &s;o &s;oon expect from Pa|ris. This vi&s;it of Sir Clement has, however, &s;omewhat diverted my fears, and therefore I am ve|ry glad he made it at this time. Adieu, my dear Sir.</P>

<P>It &s;eldom happens that a man, though extolled as a &s;aint, is really without blemi&s;h; or that another, though reviled as a devil, is really with|out humanity.

<P>WELL, my dear Sir, all is now over! the letter &s;o anxiou&s;ly expected, is at length arrived, and my doom is fixed. The various feelings which oppre&s;s me, I have not language to de&s;cribe; nor need I,&mdash;you know my heart, you have your&s;elf formed it,&mdash;and its &s;en&s;ations upon this occa&s;ion, you may but too readily imagine</P>
<P>Outca&s;t as I am; and rejected for ever by him to whom I of right belong,&mdash;&s;hall I now implore <HI>your</HI> continual protection?&mdash;no, no,&mdash;I will not offend your generous heart (which, open to di&s;tre&s;s, has no wi&s;h but to relieve it) with an application that would &s;eem to imply a doubt. I am more &s;ecure than ever of your kindne&s;s, &s;ince you now know upon that is my &s;ole dependance.</P>
<P>I endeavour to bear this &s;troke with compo&s;ure, and in &s;uch a manner as if I had already received your coun&s;el and con&s;olation. Yet, at times, my
<PB N="214" REF="229">
emotions are almo&s;t too much for me. O Sir, what a letter for a parent to write! mu&s;t I not my&s;elf be deaf to the voice of Nature, if I could endure to be thus ab&s;olutely abandoned, without regret? I dare not, even to you, nor would I, could I help it, to my&s;elf, acknowledge all that I think; for, indeed, I have, &s;ometimes, &s;entiments upon this rejection, which my &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty can &s;carcely correct. Yet, &s;uffer me to a&s;k,&mdash;might not this an&s;wer have been &s;oftened?&mdash;was it not enough to di&s;claim me for ever, without treating me with contempt, and wounding me with de|ri&s;ion?</P>
<P>But, while I am thus thinking of my&s;elf, I for|get how much more <HI>he</HI> is the object of &s;orrow, than I am! Alas, what amends can he make him|&s;elf, for the angui&s;h he is hoarding up for time to come! My heart bleeds for him, whenever this re|flection occurs to me.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid of <HI>you,</HI> my protector, my friend, my benefactor!&mdash;I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf to com|ment upon. Gracious Heaven! what a return for goodne&s;s &s;o unparalleled!</P>
<P>I would fain endeavour to divert my thoughts from this &s;ubject, but even that is not in my pow|er; for, afflicting as this letter is to me, I find that it will not be allowed to conclude the affair, though it does all my expectations: for Madame Duval has determined not to let it re&s;t here. She heard the letter in great wrath, and prote&s;ted &s;he would not be &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wered; &s;he regretted her faci|lity, in having been prevailed upon to yield the di|rection of this affair to tho&s;e who knew not how to manage it, and vowed &s;he would her&s;elf undertake and conduct it in future.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="230">
It is in vain that I have pleaded again&s;t her re&s;o|lution, and be&s;ought her to forbear an attack, where &s;he has nothing to expect but re&s;entment; e&s;peci|ally as there &s;eems to be a hint, that Lady Howard will one day be more openly dealt with: &s;he will not hear me; &s;he is furiou&s;ly bent upon a project which is terrible to think of,&mdash;for &s;he means to go go her&s;elf to Paris, take me with her, and there, <HI>face to face,</HI> demand ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>How to appea&s;e or to per&s;uade her, I know not; but for the univer&s;e would I not be dragged, in &s;uch a manner, to an interview &s;o awful, with a parent I have never yet beheld!</P>
<P>Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan are both of them infinitely &s;hocked at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, and they &s;eem to be even more kind to me than ever; and my dear Maria, who is the friend of my heart, u&s;es her utmo&s;t efforts to con&s;ole me, and, when &s;he fails in her de&s;ign, with &s;till greater kind|ne&s;s, &s;he &s;ympathi&s;es in my &s;orrow.</P>
<P>I very much rejoice, however, that Sir Clement Willoughby had left us before this letter arrived. I am &s;ure the general confu&s;ion of the hou&s;e would, otherwi&s;e, have betrayed to him the whole of a tale which I now, more than ever, wi&s;h to have buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>Lady Howard thinks I ought not to di&s;oblige Madame Duval, yet &s;he acknowledges the impropri|ety of my accompanying her abroad upon &s;uch an enterprize. Indeed I would rather die, than force my&s;elf into his pre&s;ence. But &s;o vehement is Ma|dame Duval, that &s;he would in&s;tantly have com|pelled me to attend her to town, in her way to Paris, had not Lady Howard &s;o far exerted her&s;elf, as to declare &s;he could by no means con&s;ent to my
<PB N="216" REF="231">
quitting her hou&s;e, till &s;he gave me up to you, by who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion I had entered it.</P>
<P>She was extremely angry at this denial; and the Captain, by his &s;neers and raillery, &s;o much en|crea&s;ed her rage, that &s;he has po&s;itively declared, &s;hould your next letter di&s;pute her authority to guide me by her own plea&s;ure, &s;he will, without he&s;itation, make a journey to Berry Hill, and <HI>teach you to know who &s;he is.</HI></P>
<P>Should &s;he put this threat in execution, nothing could give me greater unea&s;ine&s;s, for her violence and volubility would almo&s;t di&s;tract you.</P>
<P>Unable as I am to act for my&s;elf, or to judge what conduct I ought to pur&s;ue, how grateful do I feel my&s;elf, that I have &s;uch a guide and direc|tor to coun&s;el and in&s;truct me as your&s;elf!</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Sir! Heaven, I tru&s;t, will never never let me live to be repul&s;ed and derided by <HI>you,</HI> to whom I may now &s;ign my&s;elf</P>

<P>LET not my Evelina be depre&s;&s;ed by a &s;troke of fortune for which &s;he is not re&s;pon&s;ible. No breach of duty on your part, has incurred the unkind|ne&s;s which has been &s;hewn you, nor have you, by any act of imprudence, provoked either cen&s;ure or reproach. Let me entreat you, therefore, my deare&s;t child, to &s;upport your&s;elf with that cou|rage
<PB N="217" REF="232">
which your innocency ought to in&s;pire; and let all the affliction you allow your&s;elf, be for him only, who not having that &s;upport, mu&s;t one day be but too &s;everely &s;en&s;ible how much he wants it.</P>
<P>The hint thrown out concerning my&s;elf, is wholly unintelligible to me: my heart, I dare own, fully acquits me of vice, but <HI>without blemi&s;h,</HI> I have never ventured to pronounce my&s;elf. How|ever, it &s;eems his intention to be hereafter more explicit, and <HI>then,</HI>&mdash;&s;hould any thing appear, that has, on <HI>my</HI> part, contributed to tho&s;e misfortunes we lament, let me, at lea&s;t, &s;ay, that the mo&s;t partial of my friends cannot be &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed as I &s;hall my&s;elf be, at &s;uch a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The mention, al&s;o, of any <HI>future applications</HI> I may make, is equally beyond my comprehen&s;ion. But I will not dwell upon a &s;ubject which almo&s;t compels from me reflections that cannot but be wounding to a heart &s;o formed for filial tenderne&s;s as my Evelina's. There is an air of my&s;tery throughout the letter, the explanation of which I will await in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of Madame Duval is &s;uch as might be rea&s;onably expected from a woman &s;o little inured to di&s;appointment, and &s;o totally incapable of con&s;idering the delicacy of your &s;ituation. Your aver&s;ene&s;s to her plan gives me plea&s;ure, for it exactly corre&s;ponds with my own. Why will &s;he not make the journey &s;he projects by her&s;elf? She would not have even the wi&s;h of an oppo&s;ition to encounter. And then, once more, might my child and my&s;elf be left to the quiet enjoyment of that peaceful happine&s;s, which &s;he alone has inter|rupted. As to her coming hither, I could, indeed, di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch a vi&s;it; but, if &s;he will not be
<PB N="218" REF="233">
&s;atisfied with my refu&s;al by letter, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the ta&s;k of giving it her in per&s;on.</P>
<P>My impatience for your return is encrea&s;ed by your account of Sir Clement Willoughby's vi&s;it to Howard Grove. I am but little &s;urprized at the per&s;everance of his a&s;&s;iduities to intere&s;t you in his favour; but I am very much hurt that you &s;hould be expo&s;ed to addre&s;&s;es, which, by their privacy, have an air that &s;hocks me. You cannot, my love, be too circum&s;pect; the &s;lighte&s;t carele&s;&s;ne&s;s on your part, will be taken advantage of, by a man of his di&s;po&s;ition. It is not &s;ufficient for you to be re&s;erved; his conduct even calls for your re&s;ent|ment: and &s;hould he again, as will doubtle&s;s be his endeavour, contrive to &s;olicit your favour in private, let your di&s;dain and di&s;plea&s;ure be &s;o marked, as to con&s;train a change in his behaviour. Though, indeed, &s;hould his vi&s;it be repeated while you remain at the Grove, Lady Howard mu&s;t pardon me if I &s;horten your's.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Lady Howard.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry-Hill, <DATE>May 27.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE your Lady&s;hip will not be &s;urprized at hearing I have had a vi&s;it from Madame Duval, as I doubt not her having made known her inten|tion before &s;he left Howard Grove. I would gladly
<PB N="219" REF="234">
have excu&s;ed my&s;elf this meeting, could I have avoided it decently; but, after &s;o long a journey, it was not po&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e her admittance.</P>
<P>She told me, that &s;he came to Berry Hill, in con&s;equence of a letter I had &s;ent to her grand|daughter, in which I had forbid her going to Pa|ris. Very roughly, &s;he then called me to account for the authority which I a&s;&s;umed! and, had I been di&s;po&s;ed to have argued with her, &s;he would very angrily have di&s;puted the right by which I u&s;ed it. But I declined all debating. I therefore li&s;tened very quietly, till &s;he had &s;o much fatigued her&s;elf with talking, that &s;he was glad, in her turn, to be &s;ilent. And then I begged to know the pur|port of her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that &s;he came to make me re|linqui&s;h the power I had u&s;urped over her grand|daughter, and a&s;&s;ured me &s;he would not quit the place till &s;he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>But I will not trouble your Lady&s;hip with the particulars of this di&s;agreeable conver&s;ation; nor &s;hould I, but on account of the re&s;ult, have cho|&s;en &s;o unplea&s;ant a &s;ubject for your peru&s;al. How|ever, I will be as conci&s;e as I po&s;&s;ibly can, that the better occupations of your lady&s;hip's time may be the le&s;s impeded.</P>
<P>When &s;he found me inexorable in refu&s;ing Eve|lina's attending her to Paris, &s;he peremptorily in|&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he &s;hould, at lea&s;t, live with her in London, till Sir John Belmont's return. I re|mon&s;trated again&s;t this &s;cheme with all the energy in my power; but the conte&s;t was vain; &s;he lo&s;t her patience, and I my time. She declared that if I was re&s;olute in oppo&s;ing her, &s;he would in&s;tantly make a will, in which &s;he would leave all her

<P>To me, I own, this threat &s;eemed of little con&s;equence; I have long accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to think, that, with a competency, of which &s;he is &s;ure, my child might be as happy as in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of millions: but the incertitude of her future fate, deters me from following implicitly the dic|tates of my pre&s;ent judgment. The connections &s;he may hereafter form, the &s;tyle of life for which &s;he may be de&s;tined, and the future family to which &s;he may belong, are con&s;iderations which give but too much weight to the menaces of Ma|dame Duval. In &s;hort, Madam, after a di&s;cour&s;e infinitely tedious, I was obliged, though very re|luctantly, to compromi&s;e with this ungovernable woman, by con&s;enting that Evelina &s;hould pa&s;s one month with her.</P>
<P>I never made a conce&s;&s;ion with &s;o bad a grace, or &s;o much regret. The violence and vulgarity of this woman, her total ignorance of propriety, the family to which &s;he is related, and the compa|ny &s;he is likely to keep, are objections &s;o forcible to her having the charge of this dear child, that nothing le&s;s than my diffidence of the right I have of depriving her of &s;o large a fortune, would have induced me to li&s;ten to her propo&s;al. Indeed we parted, at la&s;t, equally di&s;contented, &s;he, at what I had refu&s;ed, I, at what I had granted.</P>
<P>It now only remains for me to return your Lady|&s;hip my humble acknowledgments for the kind|ne&s;s which you have &s;o liberally &s;hewn to my ward, and to beg you would have the goodne&s;s to part with her, when Madame Duval thinks proper

<P>WITH a reluctance which occa&s;ions me inex|pre&s;&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s, I have been almo&s;t compelled to con&s;ent that my Evelina &s;hould quit the protection of the ho&s;pitable and re&s;pectable Lady Howard, and accompany Madame Duval to a city to which I had hoped &s;he had bid an eternal adieu. But alas, my dear child, we are the &s;laves of cu&s;tom, the dupes of prejudice, and dare not &s;tem the torrent of an oppo&s;ing world, even though our judgments con|demn our compliance! however, &s;ince the die is ca&s;t, we mu&s;t endeavour to make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>You will have occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of the month you are to pa&s;s with Madame Duval, for all the circum&s;pection and prudence you can call to your aid: &s;he will not, I know, propo&s;e any thing to you which &s;he thinks wrong her&s;elf; but you mu&s;t learn not only to <HI>judge</HI> but to <HI>act</HI> for your|&s;elf; if any &s;chemes are &s;tarted, any engagements made, which your under&s;tanding repre&s;ents to you as improper, exert your&s;elf re&s;olutely in avoiding them, and do not, by a too pa&s;&s;ive facility, ri&s;k the cen&s;ure of the world, or your own future regret.</P>
<P>You cannot too a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attend to Madame Duval her&s;elf; but I would wi&s;h you to mix as lit|tle

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>June 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ONCE more, my deare&s;t Sir, I write to you from this great city. Ye&s;terday morning, with the true&s;t concern, I quitted the dear inhabitants of Howard Grove, and mo&s;t impatiently &s;hall I count the days till I &s;ee them again. Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan took leave of me with the mo&s;t flatter|ing kindne&s;s; but indeed I knew not how to part with Maria, who&s;e own apparent &s;orrow redoubled mine. She made me promi&s;e to &s;end her a letter every po&s;t. And I &s;hall write to her with the &s;ame fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">om, and almo&s;t the &s;ame confidence, you allow me to make u&s;e of to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Captain was very civil to me, but he wrangled with poor Madame Duval to the la&s;t mo|ment; and, taking me a&s;ide, ju&s;t before we got into the chai&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Hark'ee, Mi&s;s Anville, I've a favour for to a&s;k of you, which is this; that you will write us word how the old gentlewoman finds her&s;elf, when &s;he &s;ees it was all a trick; and
<PB N="223" REF="238">
what the French lubber &s;ays to it, and all about it."</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wered that I would obey him, though I was very little plea&s;ed with the commi&s;&s;ion, which, to me, was highly improper: but he will either treat me as an <HI>informer,</HI> or make me a party in his frolic.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we drove away, Madame Duval, with much &s;atisfaction, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Dieu merci,</HI> we've got off at la&s;t! I'm &s;ure I never de&s;ire to &s;ee that place again. It's a wonder I've got away alive; for I believe I've had the wor&s;t luck ever was known, from the time I &s;et my foot upon the thre&s;hold. I know I wi&s;h I'd never a gone. Be&s;ides, into the bargain, it's the mo&s;t dulle&s;t place in all Chri&s;ten|dom: there's never no diver&s;ions, nor nothing at all."</Q></P>
<P>Then &s;he bewailed M. Du Bois, concerning who&s;e adventures &s;he continued to make various conjectures during the re&s;t of our journey.</P>
<P>When I a&s;ked her what part of London &s;he &s;hould re&s;ide in, &s;he told me that Mr. Branghton was to meet us at an inn, and would conduct us to a lodging. Accordingly, we proceeded to a hou&s;e in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, and were led by a waiter in|to a room where we found Mr. Branghton.</P>
<P>He received us very civilly, but &s;eemed rather &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing me, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Why I did n't think of your bringing Mi&s;s; however &s;he's very welcome."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you how it was,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval; <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t know I've a mind to take the girl to Paris, that &s;he may &s;ee &s;omething of the world, and improve her&s;elf a little; be&s;ides, I've another rea|&s;on, that you and I will talk more about; but do you know, that meddling old par&s;on as I told you of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ould not let her go: however, I'm re&s;olved I'll
<PB N="224" REF="239">
be even with him, for I &s;hall take her on with me, without &s;aying never a word more to nobody."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tarted at this intimation, which very much &s;urpri&s;ed me. But I am very glad &s;he has di&s;cover|ed her intention, as I &s;hall be carefully upon my guard not to venture from town with her.</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton then hoped we had pa&s;&s;ed our time agreeably in the country.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord, Cou&s;in,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I've been the mi&s;erable&s;t creature in the world! I'm &s;ure all the hor&s;es in London &s;han't drag me into the country again of one while: why how do you think I've been &s;erved?&mdash;only gue&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Cou&s;in, I can't pretend to do that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then I'll tell you. Do you know, I've been robbed!&mdash;that is, the villain would have robbed me if he could, only I'd &s;ecured all my money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, Cou&s;in, I think your lo&s;s can't have been very great."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord, you don't know what you're a &s;ay|ing; you're talking in the unthinkinge&s;t manner in the world: why it was all along of not having no money, that I met with that misfortune."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How's that, Cou&s;in? I don't &s;ee what great misfortune you can have met with, if you'd &s;e|cured all your money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's becau&s;e you don't know nothing of the matter; for there the villain came to the chai&s;e, and becau&s;e we had n't got nothing to give him, though he'd no more right to our money than the man in the moon, yet, do you know, he fell into the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion ever you &s;ee, and abu&s;ed me in &s;uch a manner, and put me in a ditch, and got a rope, o' purpo&s;e to hang me,&mdash;and I'm &s;ure, if that was n't misfortune enough, why I don't know what is."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="240">
<Q REND="inline">"This is a hard ca&s;e, indeed, Cou&s;in. But why don't you go to ju&s;tice Fielding?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, as to that, I'm a going to him directly; but only I want fir&s;t to &s;ee poor M. Du Bois, for the odde&s;t thing of all is, that he has wrote to me, and never &s;aid nothing of where he is, nor what's become of him, nor nothing el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"M. Du Bois! why he's at my hou&s;e at this very time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"M. Du Bois at your hou&s;e! well, I declare this is the &s;urpri&s;inge&s;t part of all! however, I a&s;|&s;ure you, I think he might have comed for me, as well as you, con&s;idering what I have gone through on his account; for, to tell you the truth, it was all along of him that I met with that accident; &s;o I don't take it very kind of him, I promi&s;e you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but, Cou&s;in, tell me &s;ome of the par|ticulars of this affair."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to the particulars, I'm &s;ure they'd make your hair &s;tand an end to hear them; however, the beginning of it all was thro' the fault of M. Du Bois: but, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, he may take care of him&s;elf in future, &s;ince he don't &s;o much as come to &s;ee if I'm dead or alive;&mdash;but there I went for him to a ju&s;tice of peace, and rode all out of the way, and did every thing in the world, and was u&s;ed wor&s;er than a dog, and all for the &s;ake of &s;erv|ing him, and now, you &s;ee, he don't &s;o much&mdash;well, I was a fool for my pains,&mdash;however, he may get &s;omebody el&s;e to be treated &s;o another time, for if he's taken up every day in the week, I'll never go after him no more."</Q></P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned an explanation, in the cour&s;e of which, Madame Duval, to her utter amazement, heard that M. Du Bois had never left London dur|ing her ab&s;ence! nor did Mr. Branghton believe
<PB N="226" REF="241">
that he had ever been to the Tower, or met with any kind of accident.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t in&s;tantly, the whole truth of the tran|&s;action &s;eemed to <HI>ru&s;h upon her mind,</HI> and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She a&s;ked me a thou|&s;and que&s;tions in a breath, but, fortunately, was too vehement to attend to my embarra&s;&s;ment, which mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, have betrayed my know|ledge of the deceit. Revenge was her fir&s;t wi&s;h, and &s;he vowed &s;he would go the next morning to Ju&s;tice Fielding, and enquire what puni&s;hment &s;he might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>I believe we were an hour in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, ere poor Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own &s;tory; at length, how|ever, Mr. Branghton told her, that M. Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his hou&s;e. A hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow-hill.</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton's hou&s;e is &s;mall and inconveni|ent, though his &s;hop, which takes in all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I believe I told you before that he is a &s;ilver-&s;mith.</P>
<P>We were conducted up two pair of &s;tairs, for the dining-room, Mr. Branghton told us, was <HI>let.</HI> His two daughters, their brother, M. Du Bois, and a young man, were at tea. They had waited &s;ome time for Madame Duval, but I found they had not any expectation that I &s;hould accompany her; and the young ladies, I believe, were rather more &s;urpri&s;ed than plea&s;ed when I made my ap|pearance; for they &s;eemed hurt that I &s;hould &s;ee their apartment. Indeed I would willingly have &s;aved them that pain, had it been in my power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who &s;aw me was M. Du Bois:
<PB N="227" REF="242">
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ah, mon Dieu!</HI>"</Q> exclaimed he, <Q REND="inline"><HI>voil&agrave; Mademoi|&s;elle!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s,"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">if there is n't Mi&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, &s;o there is,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly; <Q REND="inline">"well, I'm &s;ure I &s;hould never have dreamed of Mi&s;s's coming."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor I neither, I'm &s;ure,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Brangh|ton, <Q REND="inline">"or el&s;e I would not have been in this room to &s;ee her; I'm quite a&s;hamed about it,&mdash;only not thinking of &s;eeing any body but my aunt&mdash;how|ever, Tom, it's all your fault, for you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr. Smith's room, only you were &s;o <HI>grumty,</HI> you would not let me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, what &s;ignifies;"</Q> &s;aid the brother, <Q REND="inline">"I dare be &s;worn Mi&s;s has been up two pair of &s;tairs before now;&mdash;Ha'n't you, Mi&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>I begged that I might not give them the lea&s;t di&s;turbance, and a&s;&s;ured them that I had not any choice in regard to what room we &s;at in.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"when you come next, Mi&s;s, we'll have Mr. Smith's room; and it's a very pretty one, and only up one pair of &s;tairs, and nicely furni&s;hed, and every thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To &s;ay the truth,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I thought that my cou&s;in would not, upon any ac|count, have come to town in the &s;ummer time; for it's not at all the <HI>fa&s;hion,</HI>&mdash;&s;o, to be &s;ure, thinks I, &s;he'll &s;tay till September, when the play-hou&s;es open."</Q></P>
<P>This was my reception, which I believe you will not call a very <HI>cordial</HI> one. Madame Duval, who, after having &s;everely reprimanded M. Du Bois for his negligence, was ju&s;t entering upon the &s;tory of her misfortunes, now wholly engaged the company.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="243">
M. Du Bois li&s;tened to her with a look of the utmo&s;t horror, repeatedly lifting up his eyes and hands, and exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>O ciel! quel barbare!</HI>"</Q> The young ladies gave her the mo&s;t earne&s;t atten|tion; but their brother, and the young man, kept a broad grin upon their faces during the whole reci|tal. She was, however, too much engaged to ob&s;erve them: but, when &s;he mentioned having been tied in a ditch, young Branghton, no longer able to con&s;train him&s;elf, bur&s;t into a loud laugh, declaring that he had never heard any thing &s;o <HI>fun|ny</HI> in his life! His laugh was heartily re-echoed by his friend; the Mi&s;s Branghtons could not re&s;i&s;t the example; and poor Madame Duval, to her extreme amazement, was ab&s;olutely overpowered and &s;topped by the violence of their mirth.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes the room &s;eemed quite in an uproar; the rage of Madame Duval, the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of M. Du Bois, and the angry interrogato|ries of Mr. Branghton, on one &s;ide; the convul|&s;ive tittering of the &s;i&s;ters, and the loud laughs of the young men, on the other, occa&s;ioned &s;uch noi&s;e, pa&s;&s;ion, and confu&s;ion, that had any one &s;topped an in&s;tant on the &s;tairs, he mu&s;t have concluded him&s;elf in Bedlam. At length, however, the fa|ther brought them to order; and, half laughing, half frightened, they made Madame Duval &s;ome very awkward apologies. But &s;he would not be prevailed upon to continue her narrative, till they had prote&s;ted they were laughing at the Captain, and not at her. Appea&s;ed by this, &s;he re&s;umed her &s;tory; which, by the help of &s;tuffing hand|kerchiefs into their mouths, the young people heard with tolerable decency.</P>
<P>Every body agreed, that the ill u&s;age the Cap|tain had given her was <HI>actionable,</HI> and Mr. Brangh|ton
<PB N="229" REF="244">
&s;aid he was &s;ure &s;he might recover what da|mages &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;ince &s;he had been put in fear of her life.</P>
<P>She then, with great delight, declared, that &s;he would lo&s;e no time in &s;atisfying her revenge, and vowed &s;he would not be contented with le&s;s than half his fortune: <Q REND="inline">"For though,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I don't put no value upon the money, becau&s;e, <HI>Dieu merci,</HI> I ha'n't no want of it, yet I don't wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as to puni&s;h that fellow; for, I'm &s;ure, whatever's the cau&s;e of it, he owes me a great <HI>grudge,</HI> and I know no more what it's for than you do, but he's always been doing me one &s;pite or other, ever &s;ince I knew him."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after tea, Mi&s;s Branghton took an oppor|tunity to tell me, in a whi&s;per, that the young man I &s;aw was a lover of her &s;i&s;ter's, that his name was Brown, and that he was a haberda&s;her, with many other particulars of his circum&s;tances and family; and then &s;he declared her utter aver&s;ion to the thoughts of &s;uch a match; but added, that her &s;i&s;ter had no manner of &s;pirit or ambition, though for her part, &s;he would ten times rather die an old maid, than marry any per&s;on but a gen|tleman. <Q REND="inline">And, for that matter,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I believe Polly her&s;elf don't care much for him, only &s;he's in &s;uch a hurry, becau&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he's a mind to be married before me; however, &s;he's very welcome, for I'm &s;ure, I don't care a pin's point whether I ever marry at all;&mdash;it's all one to me."</Q></P>
<P>Some time after this, Mi&s;s Polly contrived to tell <HI>her</HI> &s;tory. She a&s;&s;ured me, with much titter|ing, that her &s;i&s;ter was in a great fright, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be married fir&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"So I make her believe that I will,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for I love dearly to plague her a little; though, I declare, I don't
<PB N="230" REF="245">
intend to have Mr. Brown in reality; I'm &s;ure I don't like him half well enough,&mdash;do you, Mi&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to judge of his me|rits, &s;aid I, as I am entirely a &s;tranger to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what do you think of him, Mi&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, really, I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But do you think him hand&s;ome? Some peo|ple reckon him to have a good pretty per&s;on,&mdash;but, I'm &s;ure, for my part, I think he's mon&s;trous ugly:&mdash;don't <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am no judge,&mdash;but I think his per&s;on is very&mdash;very well&mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Very well!</HI>&mdash;Why, pray, Mi&s;s,"</Q> in a tone of vexation, <Q REND="inline">"what fault can you find with it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, none at all!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure you mu&s;t be very ill-natured if you could. Now there's Biddy &s;ays &s;he thinks no|thing of him,&mdash;but I know it's all out of &s;pite. You mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s, it makes her as mad as can be, that I &s;hould have a lover before her, but &s;he's &s;o proud, that nobody will court her, and I often tell her &s;he'll die an old maid. But, the thing is, &s;he has taken it into her head, to have a liking for Mr. Smith, as lodges on the fir&s;t floor; but, Lord, he'll never have her, for he's quite a fine gentleman; and be&s;ides, Mr. Brown heard him &s;ay, one day, that he'd never marry as long as he lived, for he'd no opinion of matrimony."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And did you tell your &s;i&s;ter this?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, to be &s;ure I told her directly; but &s;he did not mind me; however, if &s;he will be a fool, &s;he mu&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>This extreme want of affection, and good-na|ture, increa&s;ed the di&s;ta&s;te I already felt for the&s;e unamiable &s;i&s;ters; and a confidence &s;o entirely un|&s;olicited
<PB N="231" REF="246">
and unnece&s;&s;ary, manife&s;ted equally their folly and their want of decency.</P>
<P>I was very glad when the time for our departing arrived. Mr. Branghton &s;aid our lodgings were in Holborn, that we might be near his hou&s;e, and neighbourly. He accompanied us to them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our rooms are large and not inconvenient; our landlord is an ho&s;ier. I am &s;ure I have a thou&s;and rea&s;ons to rejoice that I am &s;o little known; for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation is, in every re&s;pect, very un|enviable, and I would not, for the world, be &s;een by any acquaintance of Mrs. Mirvan.</P>
<P>This morning Madame Duval, attended by all the Branghtons, actually went to a Ju&s;tice in the neighbourhood, to report the Captain's ill u&s;age of her. I had great difficulty in excu&s;ing my&s;elf from being of the party, which would have given me very &s;erious concern. Indeed, I was extremely anxious, though at home, till I heard the re&s;ult of the application; for I dread to think of the unea|&s;ine&s;s which &s;uch an affair would occa&s;ion the amiable Mrs. Mirvan. But, fortunately, Madame Duval has received very little encouragement to proceed in her de&s;ign, for &s;he has been informed that, as &s;he neither heard the voice, nor &s;aw the face of the per&s;on &s;u&s;pected, &s;he will find it diffi|cult to ca&s;t him upon <HI>conjecture,</HI> and will have but little probability of gaining her cau&s;e, unle&s;s &s;he can procure witne&s;&s;es of the tran&s;action. Mr. Branghton, therefore, who has con&s;idered all the circum&s;tances of the affair, is of opinion, that the law-&s;uit will not only be expen&s;ive, but tedious and hazardous, and has advi&s;ed again&s;t it. Ma|dame Duval, though very unwillingly, has ac|quie&s;ced in his deci&s;ion; but vows that if ever &s;he is &s;o affronted again, &s;he will be revenged, even if

<P>I HAVE no words, my &s;weet friend, to expre&s;s the thankfulne&s;s I feel for the unbounded kindne&s;s which you, your dear mother, and the much-ho|noured Lady Howard, have &s;hewn me; and &s;till le&s;s can I find language to tell you with what re|luctance I parted from &s;uch dear and generous friends, who&s;e goodne&s;s reflects, at once, &s;o much honour on their own hearts, and on her to whom it has been &s;o liberally be&s;towed. But I will not repeat what I have already written to the kind Mrs. Mirvan; I will remember your admonitions, and confine to my own brea&s;t that gratitude with which you have filled it, and teach my pen to dwell upon &s;ubjects le&s;s painful to my generous corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>O Maria, London now &s;eems no longer the &s;ame place where I lately enjoyed &s;o much happi|ne&s;s; every thing is new and &s;trange to me; even the town it&s;elf has not the &s;ame a&s;pect:&mdash;my &s;itu|ation &s;o altered! my home &s;o different!&mdash;my com|panions &s;o changed!&mdash;But you well know my aver&s;ene&s;s to this journey.</P>
<P>Indeed, to me, London now &s;eems a de&s;art; that gay and bu&s;y appearance it &s;o lately wore, is now &s;ucceeded by a look of gloom, fatigue, and la&s;&s;i|tude; the air &s;eems &s;tagnant, the heat is inten&s;e,
<PB N="233" REF="248">
the du&s;t intolerable, and the inhabitants illiterate and under-bred. At lea&s;t, &s;uch is the face of things in the part of the town where I at pre&s;ent re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Tell me, my dear Maria, do you never re|trace in your memory the time we pa&s;t here when together? to mine, it recurs for ever! And yet, I think I rather recollect a dream, or &s;ome vi&s;ionary fancy, than a reality.&mdash;That I &s;hould ever have been known to Lord Orville,&mdash;that I &s;hould have &s;poken to&mdash;have danced with him,&mdash;&s;eems now a romantic illu&s;ion: and that elegant politene&s;s, that flattering attention, that high-bred delicacy, which &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed him above all other men, and which &s;truck us with &s;uch admiration, I now re|trace the remembrance of, rather as belonging to an object of ideal perfection, formed by my own imagination, than to a being of the &s;ame race and nature as tho&s;e with whom I at pre&s;ent conver&s;e.</P>
<P>I have no news for you, my dear Mi&s;s Mirvan, for all that I could venture to &s;ay of Madame Du|val, I have already written to your &s;weet mother; and as to adventures, I have none to record. Si|tuated as I now am, I heartily hope I &s;hall not meet with any; my wi&s;h is to remain quiet and unnoticed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Holborn, <DATE>June 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, we received an invitation to dine and &s;pend the day at Mr. Brangh|ton's;
<PB N="234" REF="249">
and M. Du Bois, who was al&s;o invited, called to conduct us to Snow-hill.</P>
<P>Young Branghton received us at the door, and the fir&s;t words he &s;poke were, <Q REND="inline">"Do you know, "Si&s;ters a'n't dre&s;&s;ed yet?"</Q></P>
<P>Then, hurrying us into the hou&s;e, he &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Come, Mi&s;s, you &s;hall go up &s;tairs and catch 'em,&mdash;I dare &s;ay they're at the gla&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>He would have taken my hand, but I declined his civility, and begged to follow Madame Duval. Mr. Branghton then appeared, and led the way him&s;elf. We went, as before, up two pair of &s;tairs; but the moment the father opened the door, the daughters both gave a loud &s;cream. We all &s;topped, and then Mi&s;s Branghton called out, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Papa, what do you bring the company up here for? why, Polly and I a'n't half dre&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More &s;hame for you,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">here's your aunt, and cou&s;in, and M. Du Bois, all wait|ing, and ne'er a room to take them to."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who'd have thought of their coming &s;o &s;oon?"</Q> cried &s;he: <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure for my part I thought Mi&s;s was u&s;ed to nothing but quality hours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I &s;han't be ready this half-hour yet,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly; <Q REND="inline">"can't they &s;tay in the &s;hop till we're dre&s;&s;ed?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Branghton was very angry, and &s;colded them violently; however, we were obliged to de|&s;cend, and &s;tools were procured for us in the &s;hop, where we found the brother, who was highly de|lighted, he &s;aid, that his &s;i&s;ters had been <HI>catched;</HI> and he thought proper to entertain me with a long account of their tediou&s;ne&s;s, and the many quar|rels they all had together.</P>
<P>When, at length, the&s;e ladies were equipped to their &s;atisfaction, they made their appearance; but
<PB N="235" REF="250">
before any conver&s;ation was &s;uffered to pa&s;s between them and us, they had a long and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable dialogue with their father, to who&s;e reprimands, though &s;o ju&s;tly incurred, they replied with the utmo&s;t pertne&s;s and rudene&s;s, while their brother, all the time, laughed aloud.</P>
<P>The moment they perceived this, they were &s;o much provoked, that, in&s;tead of making any apologies to Madame Duval, they next began a quarrel with him. <Q REND="inline">"Tom, what do you laugh for? I wonder what bu&s;ine&s;s you have to be al|ways a laughing when Papa &s;colds us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then what bu&s;ine&s;s have you to be &s;uch a while getting on your cloaths? You're never ready, you know well enough."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Sir, I wonder what that's to you! I wi&s;h you'd mind your own affairs, and not trou|ble your&s;elf about ours. How &s;hould a boy like you know any thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A boy, indeed! not &s;uch a boy, neither; I'll warrant you'll be glad to be as young, when you come to be old maids."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ort of dialogue we were amu&s;ed with till dinner was ready, when we again mounted up two pair of &s;tairs.</P>
<P>In our way, Mi&s;s Polly told me that her &s;i&s;ter had a&s;ked Mr. Smith for his room to dine in, but he had refu&s;ed to lend it; <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"one day it happened to be a little grea&s;ed: how|ever, we &s;hall have it to drink tea in, and then, perhaps, you may &s;ee him, and I a&s;&s;ure you he's quite like one of the quality, and dre&s;&s;es as fine, and goes to balls and dances, and every thing quite in ta&s;te;&mdash;and be&s;ides, Mi&s;s, he keeps a foot-boy of his own, too."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="251">
The dinner was ill-&s;erved, ill-cooked, and ill|managed. The maid who waited had &s;o often to go down &s;tairs for &s;omething that was forgotten, that the Branghtons were perpetually obliged to ri&s;e from table them&s;elves, to get plates, knives and forks, bread, or beer. Had they been with|out <HI>preten&s;ions,</HI> all this would have &s;eemed of no con&s;equence; but they aimed at appearing to ad|vantage, and even fancied they &s;ucceeded. How|ever, the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of our fare was, that the whole family continually di&s;puted who&s;e turn it was to ri&s;e, and who&s;e to be allowed to &s;it &s;till.</P>
<P>When this meal was over, Madame Duval, Mr. Branghton, and, in broken Engli&s;h. M. Du Bois, entered into an argument concerning the French nation; and Mi&s;s Polly, then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Don't you think, Mi&s;s, it's very dull &s;itting up &s;tairs here? we'd better go down <HI>to &s;hop,</HI> and then we &s;hall &s;ee the people go by."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Poll,"</Q> &s;aid the brother, <Q REND="inline">"you're al|ways wanting to be &s;taring and gaping; and I'm &s;ure you need n't be &s;o fond of &s;hewing your&s;elf, for you're ugly enough to frighten a hor&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ugly, indeed! I wonder which is be&s;t, you or me. But, I tell you what, Tom, you've no need to give your&s;elf &s;uch airs, for if you do, I'll tell Mi&s;s of you know what&mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who cares if you do? You may tell what you will; I don't mind&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I do not de&s;ire to hear any &s;ecrets."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, but I'm re&s;olved I'll tell you, becau&s;e Tom's &s;o very &s;piteful. You mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s, t'other night&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="252">
<Q REND="inline">"Poll,"</Q> cried the brother, <Q REND="inline">"if you tell of that, Mi&s;s &s;hall know all about your meeting young Brown,&mdash;you know when!&mdash;So I'll be quits with you, one way or another."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Polly coloured, and again propo&s;ed our go|ing down &s;tairs till Mr. Smith's room was ready for our reception.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, &s;o we will,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Cou&s;in, we have &s;ome very gen|teel people pa&s;s by our &s;hop &s;ometimes. Polly and I always go and &s;it there, when we've cleaned our&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried the brother, <Q REND="inline">"they do nothing el&s;e all day long, when father don't &s;cold them. But the be&s;t fun is, when they've got all their dirty things on, and all their hair about their ears, &s;ometimes I &s;end young Brown up &s;tairs to them; and then, there's &s;uch a fu&s;s!&mdash;there they hide them&s;elves, and run away, and &s;queal and &s;quall like any thing mad: and &s;o then I puts the two cats into the room, and I gives 'em a good whip|ping, and &s;o that &s;ets them a &s;qualling too; &s;o there's &s;uch a noi&s;e, and &s;uch an uproar!&mdash;Lord, you can't think, Mi&s;s, what fun it is!"</Q></P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned a fre&s;h quarrel with the &s;i&s;ters; at the end of which, it was, at length, decided that we &s;hould go to the &s;hop.</P>
<P>In our way down &s;tairs, Mi&s;s Branghton &s;aid aloud, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder when Mr. Smith's room will be ready."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So do I,"</Q> an&s;wered Polly; <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure we &s;hould not do any harm to it now."</Q></P>
<P>This hint had not the de&s;ired effect; for we were &s;uffered to proceed very quietly.</P>
<P>As we entered the &s;hop, I ob&s;erved a young man, in deep mourning, leaning again&s;t the wall, with
<PB N="238" REF="253">
his arms folded, and his eyes fixed on the ground, apparently in profound and melancholy meditation: but the moment he perceived us, he &s;tarted, and, making a pa&s;&s;ing bow, very abruptly retired. As I found he was permitted to go quite unnoticed, I could not forbear enquiring who he was.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord!"</Q> an&s;wered Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"he's no|thing but a poor Scotch poet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For my part,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"I believe he's ju&s;t &s;tarved, for I don't find he has any thing to live upon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Live upon!"</Q> cried the brother, <Q REND="inline">"why he's a poet, you know, &s;o he may live upon learning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, and good enough for him too,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"for he's as proud as he's poor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Like enough,"</Q> replied the brother, <Q REND="inline">"but, for all that, you won't find he will live without meat and drink: no, no, catch a Scotchman at that if you can! why, they only come here for what they can get."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder Papa 'll be &s;uch a fool as to let him &s;tay in the hou&s;e, for I dare &s;ay he'll never pay for his lodging."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, no more he would, if he could get another Lodger: you know the bill's been put up this fortnight. Mi&s;s, if you &s;hould hear of a per|&s;on that wants a room, I a&s;&s;ure you it is a very good one, for all it's up three pair of &s;tairs."</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that as I had no acquaintance in London, I had not any chance of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them: but both my compa&s;&s;ion and my curio&s;ity were ex|cited for this poor young man: and I a&s;ked them &s;ome further particulars concerning him.</P>
<P>They then acquainted me, that they had only known him three months. When he fir&s;t lodged
<PB N="239" REF="254">
with them, he agreed to board al&s;o; but had late|ly told them, he would eat by him&s;elf, though they all believed he had hardly ever ta&s;ted a mor&s;el of meat &s;ince he left their table. They &s;aid, that he had always appeared very low-&s;pirited, but, for the la&s;t month, he had been <HI>duller</HI> than ever, and, all of a &s;udden, had put him&s;elf into mourning, though they knew not for whom, nor for what, but they &s;uppo&s;ed it was only for convenience, as no per&s;on had ever been to &s;ee or enquire for him &s;ince his re&s;idence among&s;t them: and they were &s;ure he was very poor, as he had not paid for his lodgings the la&s;t three weeks: and finally, they concluded he was a poet, or el&s;e half-crazy, be|cau&s;e they had, at different times, found &s;craps of poetry in his room.</P>
<P>They then produced &s;ome unfini&s;hed ver&s;es, written on &s;mall pieces of paper, unconnected, and of a mo&s;t melancholy ca&s;t. Among them was the fragment of an ode, which, at my re|que&s;t, they lent me to copy; and, as you may perhaps like to &s;ee it, I will write it now.</P>
<Q><L>O LIFE! thou lingering dream of grief, of pain,</L>
<L>And every ill that nature can &s;u&s;tain,</L>
<L>Strange, mutable, and wild!</L>
<L>Now flattering with Hope mo&s;t fair,</L>
<L>Depre&s;&s;ing now with fell De&s;pair,</L>
<L>The nur&s;e of Guilt, the &s;lave of Pride,</L>
<L>That, like a wayward child,</L>
<L>Who, to him&s;elf a foe,</L>
<L>Sees joy alone in what's denied,</L>
<L>In what is granted, woe!</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="255">
O thou poor, feeble, fleeting pow'r,</L>
<L>By Vice &s;educ'd, by Folly woo'd,</L>
<L>By Mis'ry, Shame, Remor&s;e pur&s;u'd!</L>
<L>And as thy toil&s;ome &s;teps proceed,</L>
<L>Seeming to Youth the faire&s;t flow'r,</L>
<L>Proving to Age the ranke&s;t weed,</L>
<L>A gilded, but a bitter pill,</L>
<L>Of varied, great, and complicated ill!</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e lines are har&s;h, but they indicate an in|ternal wretchedne&s;s which, I own, affects me. Surely this young man mu&s;t be involved in misfor|tunes of no common nature: but I cannot imagine what can induce him to remain with this unfeel|ing family, where he is, mo&s;t unworthily, de|&s;pi&s;ed for being poor, and, mo&s;t illiberally, de|te&s;ted for being a Scotchman. He may, indeed, have motives which he cannot &s;urmount, for &s;ub|mitting to &s;uch a &s;ituation. Whatever they are, I mo&s;t heartily pity him, and cannot but wi&s;h it were in my power to afford him &s;ome relief.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, Mr. Smith's foot boy came to Mi&s;s Branghton, and informed her, that his ma&s;ter &s;aid &s;he might have the room now when &s;he liked it, for that he was pre&s;ently going out.</P>
<P>This very genteel me&s;&s;age, though it perfectly &s;atisfied the Mi&s;s Branghtons, by no means added to my de&s;ire of being introduced to this gentle|man: and upon their ri&s;ing, with intention to ac|cept his offer, I begged they would excu&s;e my at|tending them, and &s;aid I would &s;it with Madame Duval till the tea was ready.</P>
<P>I therefore once more went up two pair of &s;tairs, with young Branghton, who in&s;i&s;ted upon accom|panying me; and there we remained, till Mr.
<PB N="241" REF="256">
Smith's foot-boy &s;ummoned us to tea, when I fol|lowed Madame Duval into the dining-room.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;s Branghtons were &s;eated at one win|dow, and Mr. Smith was lolling indolently out of the other. They all approached us at our en|trance, and Mr. Smith, probably, to &s;hew he was ma&s;ter of the apartment, mo&s;t officiou&s;ly hand|ed me to a great chair, at the upper end of the room, without taking any notice of Madame Du|val, till I ro&s;e, and offered her my own &s;eat.</P>
<P>Leaving the re&s;t of the company to entertain them&s;elves, he, very abruptly, began to addre&s;s him&s;elf to me, in a &s;tyle of gallantry, equally new and di&s;agreeable to me. It is true, no man can po&s;&s;ibly pay me greater compliments, or make more fine &s;peeches, than Sir Clement Willoughby, yet his language, though too flowery, is always that of a gentleman, and his addre&s;s and manners are &s;o very &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the inhabitants of this hou&s;e, that to make any compari&s;on between him and Mr. Smith would be extremely unju&s;t. This latter &s;eems very de&s;irous of appearing a man of gaiety and &s;pirit; but his vivacity is &s;o low bred, and his whole behaviour &s;o forward and di&s;|agreeable, that I &s;hould prefer the company of <HI>dullne&s;s</HI> it&s;elf, even as that godde&s;s is de&s;cribed by Pope, to that of this <HI>&s;prightly</HI> young man.</P>
<P>He made many apologies, that he had not lent his room for our dinner, which, he &s;aid, he &s;hould certainly have done, had he &s;een me fir&s;t; and he a&s;&s;ured me, that when I came again, he &s;hould be very glad to oblige me.</P>
<P>I told him, with &s;incerity, that every part of the hou&s;e was equally indifferent to me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Ma'am, the truth is, Mi&s;s Biddy and Polly take no care of any thing el&s;e. I'm &s;ure,
<PB N="242" REF="257">
they &s;hould be always welcome to my room; for I'm never &s;o happy as in obliging the ladies,&mdash;that's my character, Ma'am;&mdash;but, really, the la&s;t time they had it, every thing was made &s;o grea&s;y and &s;o na&s;ty, that, upon my word, to a man who wi&s;hes to have things a little genteel, it was quite cruel. Now, as to you, Ma'am, its quite another thing; for I &s;hould not mind if every thing I had was &s;poilt, for the &s;ake of having the plea&s;ure to oblige you; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am, it makes me quite happy, that I have a room good enough to receive you."</Q></P>
<P>This elegant &s;peech was followed by many others, &s;o much in the &s;ame &s;tyle, that to write them would be &s;uperfluous; and, as he did not allow me a moment to &s;peak to any other per&s;on, the re&s;t of the evening was con&s;umed in a painful attention to this irk&s;ome young man, who &s;eemed to intend appearing before me to the utmo&s;t advan|tage.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir. I fear you will be &s;ick of reading about this family; yet I mu&s;t write of them, or not of any, &s;ince I mix with no other. Happy &s;hall I be, when I quit them all, and again return to Berry Hill!</P>

<P>THIS morning, Mr. Smith called, <HI>on purpo&s;e,</HI> he &s;aid, to offer me a ticket for the next Hamp|&s;tead a&s;&s;embly. I thanked him, but de&s;ired to be
<PB N="243" REF="258">
excu&s;ed accepting it; he would not, however, be denied, nor an&s;wered, and in a manner both ve|hement and free, pre&s;&s;ed and urged his offer till I was wearied to death: but, when he found me re&s;olute, he &s;eemed thunder&s;truck with amazement, and thought proper to de&s;ire I would tell him my rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Obvious as they mu&s;t, &s;urely, have been to any other per&s;on, they were &s;uch as I knew not how to repeat to him; and, when he found I he|&s;itated, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am, you are too mode&s;t; I a&s;&s;ure you the ticket is quite at your &s;ervice, and I &s;hall be very happy to dance with you; &s;o pray don't be &s;o coy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline">"you are mi&s;taken; I never &s;uppo&s;ed you would offer a ticket, with|out wi&s;hing it &s;hould be accepted; but it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to mention the rea&s;ons which make me decline it, &s;ince they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be removed."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech &s;eemed very much to mortify him, which I could not be concerned at, as I did not chu&s;e to be treated by him with &s;o much freedom. When he was, at la&s;t, convinced that his appli|cation to me was ineffectual, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Madame Duval, and begged &s;he would interfere in his favour, offering, at the &s;ame time, to pro|cure another ticket for her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"you might as well have had the complai&s;ance to a&s;k me before, for, I a&s;&s;ure you, I don't approve of no &s;uch rudene&s;s: however, you may keep your tick|ets to your&s;elf, for we don't want none of 'em.</Q></P>
<P>This rebuke almo&s;t over &s;et him; he made many apologies, and &s;aid that he &s;hould certainly have fir&s;t applied to her, but that he had no notion the
<PB N="244" REF="259">
<HI>young</HI> lady would have refu&s;ed him, and, on the contrary, had concluded that &s;he would have a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed him to per&s;uade Madame Duval her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This excu&s;e appea&s;ed her; and he pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that, to my great chagrin, he gained it; and Madame Duval promi&s;ed that &s;he would go her&s;elf, and take me to the Hamp|&s;tead a&s;&s;embly whenever he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith then, approaching me with an air of triumph, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Ma'am, now, I think, you can't po&s;&s;ibly keep to your denial."</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer, and he &s;oon took leave, though not till he had &s;o wonderfully gained the favour of Madame Duval, that &s;he declared, when he was gone, he was the prettie&s;t young man &s;he had &s;een &s;ince &s;he came to England.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I could find an opportunity, I ven|tured, in the mo&s;t humble manner, to entreat Ma|dame Duval would not in&s;i&s;t upon my attending her to this ball; and repre&s;ented to her, as well as I was able, the impropriety of my accepting any pre&s;ent from a young man &s;o entirely unknown to me: but &s;he laughed at my &s;cruples, called me a fooli&s;h, ignorant, country girl, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould make it her bu&s;ine&s;s to teach me &s;omething of the world.</P>
<P>This ball is to be next week. I am &s;ure it is not more improper for, than unplea&s;ant to me, and I will u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible endeavour to avoid it. Perhaps I may apply to Mi&s;s Branghton for advice, as I believe &s;he will be willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, from di&s;liking, equally with my&s;elf, that I &s;hould dance with Mr. Smith.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="260">
July 11th.</P>
<P>O, my dear Sir! I have been &s;hocked to death,&mdash;and yet, at the &s;ame time, delighted beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in the hope that I have happily been the in&s;trument of &s;aving a human creature from de&s;truc|tion!</P>
<P>This morning, Madame Duval &s;aid &s;he would invite the Branghton family to return our vi&s;it to|morrow; and, not chu&s;ing to ri&s;e her&s;elf,&mdash;for &s;he generally &s;pends the morning in bed,&mdash;&s;he de&s;i|red me to wait upon them with her me&s;&s;age. M. Du Bois, who ju&s;t then called, in&s;i&s;ted upon attend|ing me.</P>
<P>Mr. Branghton was in the &s;hop, and told us that his &s;on and daughters were out; but de&s;ired me to &s;tep up &s;tairs, as he very &s;oon expected them home. This I did, leaving M. Du Bois below. I went into the room where they had dined the day before, and, by a wonderful chance, I happended &s;o to &s;eat my&s;elf, that I had a view of the &s;tairs, and yet could not be &s;een from them.</P>
<P>In about ten minutes time, I &s;aw, pa&s;&s;ing by the door, with a look perturbed and affrighted, the &s;ame young man I mentioned in my la&s;t letter. Not heeding, as I &s;uppo&s;e, how he went, in turn|ing the corner of the &s;tairs, which are narrow and winding, his foot &s;lipped, and he fell, but, almo&s;t in&s;tantly ri&s;ing, I plainly perceived the end of a pi&s;tol, which &s;tarted from his pocket, by hitting again&s;t the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked. All that I had heard of his mi&s;ery occurring to my memory, made me conclude, that he was, at that very moment, meditating &s;uicide! Struck with the dreadful idea, all my &s;trength &s;eemed to fail me;&mdash;I &s;at motion|le&s;s;<PB N="246" REF="261">
&mdash;I lo&s;t all power of action,&mdash;and grew almo&s;t &s;tiff with horror.</P>
<P>He moved on &s;lowly,&mdash;yet I &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him. I then trembled &s;o violently, that my chair actually &s;hook under me; till, recollecting that it was yet po&s;&s;ible to prevent the fatal deed, all my faculties &s;eemed to return, with the hope of &s;aving him.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t thought was to fly to Mr. Branghton, but I feared that an in&s;tant of time lo&s;t, might for ever be rued; and therefore, guided by the im|pul&s;e of my apprehen&s;ions, as well as I was able, I followed him up &s;tairs, &s;tepping very &s;oftly, and obliged to &s;upport my&s;elf by the bani&s;ters.</P>
<P>When I came within a few &s;tairs of the landing|place, I &s;topped, for I could then &s;ee into his room, as he had not yet &s;hut the door.</P>
<P>He had put the pi&s;tol upon a table, and had his hand in his pocket, whence, in a few moments, he took out another: He then emptied &s;omething on the table from a &s;mall leather bag; after which, taking up both the pi&s;tols, one in each hand, he dropt ha&s;tily upon his knees, and called out <Q REND="inline">"O God!&mdash;Forgive me!"</Q></P>
<P>In a moment, &s;trength and courage &s;eemed lent me as by in&s;piration: I &s;tarted, and ru&s;hing pre|cipitately into the room, ju&s;t caught his arm, and then, overcome by my own fears, I fell down at his &s;ide, breathle&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. My recovery, however, was, I believe, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous; and then the &s;ight of this unhappy man, regarding me with a look of unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment, mixed with concern, pre&s;ently re&s;tored to me my recollecti|on. I aro&s;e, though with difficulty; he did the &s;ame; the pi&s;tols, as I &s;oon &s;aw, were both on the floor.</P>
<P>Unwilling to leave them, and, indeed, too weak
<PB N="247" REF="262">
to move, I leant one hand on the table, and then &s;tood perfectly &s;till: while he, his eyes ca&s;t wildly towards me, &s;eemed too infinitely amazed to be ca|pable of either &s;peech or action.</P>
<P>I believe we were &s;ome minutes in this extraor|dinary &s;ituation; but, as my &s;trength returned, I felt my&s;elf both a&s;hamed and awkward, and ma|king a &s;light courte&s;ie, I moved towards the door. Pale, and motionle&s;s, he &s;uffered me to pa&s;s, with|out changing his po&s;ture, or uttering a &s;yllable; and, indeed,
<Q><L>He looked a bloodle&s;s image of de&s;pair!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's Iliad.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>When I reached the door, I turned round; I looked fearfully at the pi&s;tols, and, impelled by an emotion I could not repre&s;s, I ha&s;tily &s;tepped back, with an intention of carrying them away: but their wretched owner, perceiving my de&s;ign, and reco|vering from his a&s;toni&s;hment, darting &s;uddenly down, &s;eized them both him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Wild with fright, and &s;carce knowing what I did, I caught, almo&s;t involuntarily, hold of both his arms, and exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"O Sir! have mercy on your&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>The guilty pi&s;tols fell from his hands, which, di&s;engaging from me, he fervently cla&s;ped, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"Sweet Heaven! is this thy angel?"</Q></P>
<P>Encouraged by &s;uch gentlene&s;s, I again attempted to take the pi&s;tols, but, with a look half frantic, he again prevented me, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"What would you do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Awaken you,"</Q> I cried, with a courage I now wonder at, <Q REND="inline">"to worthier thoughts, and re&s;cue you from perdition."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="263">
I then &s;eized the pi&s;tols; he &s;aid not a word,&mdash;he made no effort to &s;top me;&mdash;I glided quick by him, and tottered down &s;tairs, ere he had recovered from the extreme&s;t amazement.</P>
<P>The moment I reached again the room I had &s;o fearfully left, I threw away the pi&s;tols, and flinging my&s;elf on the fir&s;t chair, gave free vent to the feelings I had mo&s;t painfully &s;tifled, in a violent bur&s;t of tears, which, indeed, proved a happy re|lief to me.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I remained &s;ome time; but when, at length, I lifted up my head, the fir&s;t object I &s;aw, was the poor man who had occa&s;ioned my terror, &s;tanding, as if petrified, at the door, and gazing at me with eyes of wild wonder.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted from the chair, but trembled &s;o exce&s;|&s;ively, that I almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;unk again into it. He then, though without advancing, and in a fal|tering voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Whoever or whatever you are, relieve me, I pray you, from the &s;u&s;pen&s;e un|der which my &s;oul labours&mdash;and tell me if indeed I do not dream?"</Q></P>
<P>To this addre&s;s, &s;o &s;ingular and &s;o &s;olemn, I had not then the pre&s;ence of mind to frame any an|&s;wer; but, as I pre&s;ently perceived that his eyes turned from me to the pi&s;tols, and that he &s;eemed to intend regaining them, I exerted all my &s;trength, and &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"O for Heaven's &s;ake, forbear!"</Q> I ro&s;e and took them my&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do my &s;en&s;es deceive me!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"do <HI>I</HI> live&mdash;? and do you&mdash;?"</Q></P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he advanced towards me, and I, &s;till guarding the pi&s;tols, retreated, &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"No, no,&mdash;you mu&s;t not&mdash;mu&s;t not have them!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why&mdash;for what purpo&s;e, tell me!&mdash;do you withhold them?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="264">
<Q REND="inline">"To give you time to <HI>think,</HI> to &s;ave you from eternal mi&s;ery,&mdash;and, I hope, to re&s;erve you for mercy and forgivene&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wonderful!"</Q> cried he, with uplifted hands and eyes, <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t wonderful!"</Q></P>
<P>For &s;ome time, he &s;eemed wrapped in deep thought, till a &s;udden noi&s;e of tongues below, an|nouncing the approach of the Branghtons, made him &s;tart from his reverie: he &s;prung ha&s;tily for|ward,&mdash;dropt on one knee,&mdash;caught hold of my gown, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, and then, quick as lightning, he ro&s;e, and flew up &s;tairs to his own room.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the whole of this ex|traordinary and &s;hocking adventure, really too af|fecting to be borne; and &s;o entirely had I &s;pent my &s;pirits and exhau&s;ted my courage, that, before the Branghtons reached me, I had &s;unk on the ground, without &s;en&s;e or motion.</P>
<P>I believe I mu&s;t have been a very horrid &s;ight to them, on their entrance into the room; for, to all appearance, I &s;eemed to have &s;uffered a violent death, either by my own ra&s;hne&s;s, or the cruelty of &s;ome murderer; as the pi&s;tols were fallen clo&s;e by my &s;ide.</P>
<P>How &s;oon I recovered, I know not, but, pro|bably, I was more indebted to the loudne&s;s of their cries, than to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for they all con|cluded that I was dead, and, for &s;ome time, did not make any effort to revive me.</P>
<P>Scarcely could I recollect <HI>where</HI> or, indeed, <HI>what</HI> I was, ere they poured upon me &s;uch a tor|rent of que&s;tions and enquiries, that I was almo&s;t &s;tunned with their vociferation. However, as &s;oon and as well as I was able, I endeavoured
<PB N="250" REF="265">
to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity, by recounting what had happened as clearly as was in my power. They all looked agha&s;t at the recital, but, not being well enough to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, I beg|ged to have a chair called, and to return in&s;tantly home.</P>
<P>Before I left them, I recommended, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, a vigilant ob&s;ervance of their unhappy lodger, and that they would take e&s;pecial care to keep from him, if po&s;&s;ible, all means of &s;elf-de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>M. Du Bois, who &s;eemed extremely concerned at my indi&s;po&s;ition, walked by the &s;ide of the chair, and &s;aw me &s;afe to my own apartment.</P>
<P>The ra&s;hne&s;s and the mi&s;ery of this ill-fated young man, engro&s;s all my thoughts. If, indeed, he is bent upon de&s;troying him&s;elf, all efforts to &s;ave him will be fruitle&s;s. How much do I wi&s;h it were in my power to di&s;cover the nature of the malady which thus maddens him, and to offer or to procure alleviation to his &s;ufferings! I am &s;ure, my deare&s;t Sir, you will be much concerned for this poor man, and were you here, I doubt not but you would find &s;ome method of awakening him from the error which blinds him, and of pour|ing the balm of peace and comfort into his afflicted &s;oul!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Holborn, <DATE>June 13th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY all the Branghtons dined here. Our conver&s;ation was almo&s;t wholly concerning the adventure of the day before. Mr. Branghton &s;aid, that his fir&s;t thought was in&s;tantly to turn his lodger out of doors, <Q REND="inline">"Le&s;t,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"his killing him&s;elf in my hou&s;e, &s;hould bring me into any trouble; but then, I was afraid I &s;hould never get the money he owes me, whereas, if he dies in my hou&s;e, I have a right to all he leaves be|hind him, if he goes off in my debt. Indeed, I would put him in pri&s;on&mdash;but what &s;hould I get by that? he could not earn any thing there to pay me. So I con&s;idered about it &s;ome time, and then I determined to a&s;k him, point-blank, for my money out of hand. And &s;o I did, but he told me he'd pay me next week: however, I gave him to under&s;tand, that though I was no Scotch|man, yet I did not like to be over-reached any more than he; &s;o then, he gave me a ring, which, to my certain knowledge, mu&s;t be worth ten gui|neas, and told me he would not part with it for his life, and a good deal more &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff, but that I might keep it till he could pay me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is ten to one, Father, &s;aid young Branghton, if he came fairly by it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very likely not,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"but that will make no great difference; for I &s;hall be able to prove my right to it all one."</Q></P>
<P>What principles! I could hardly &s;tay in the room.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="267">
<Q REND="inline">"I'm determined,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I'll take &s;ome opportunity to affront him &s;oon, now I know how poor he is, becau&s;e of the airs he gave him|&s;elf to me when he fir&s;t came."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray how was that, child?"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you never knew &s;uch a fu&s;s in your life as he made, becau&s;e, one day at dinner, I only happened to &s;ay, that I &s;uppo&s;ed he had never got &s;uch a good meal in his life, before he came to England: there he fell in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as you can't think; but, for my part, I took notice of it, for to be &s;ure, thinks I, he mu&s;t needs be a gentle|man, or he'd never go to be &s;o angry about it. However, he won't put his tricks upon me again, in a hurry."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, he's grown quite an|other creature to what he was, and he does n't run away from us, nor hide him&s;elf, nor any thing: and he's as civil as can be, and he's always in the &s;hop, and he &s;aunters about the &s;tairs, and he looks at every body who comes in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you may &s;ee what's after plain enough, &s;aid Mr. Branghton; he wants to &s;ee Mi&s;s again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Lord, how I &s;hould laugh,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"if he &s;hould have fell in Love with Mi&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s is welcome; but, for my part, I &s;hould be quite a&s;hamed of &s;uch a beggarly conque&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the conver&s;ation till tea time, when the appearance of Mr. Smith gave a new turn to the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Branghton de&s;ired me to remark with what a <HI>&s;mart air</HI> he entered the room, and a&s;ked me if he had not very much a <HI>quality look?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="268">
<Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> cried he, advancing to us, <Q REND="inline">"you ladies mu&s;t not &s;it together; wherever I go, I always make it a rule to part the ladies."</Q></P>
<P>And then, handing Mi&s;s Branghton to the next chair, he &s;eated him&s;elf between us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, now, ladies, I think we &s;it very well. What &s;ay you? for my part, I think it was a very good motion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If my Cou&s;in likes it,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure I've no objection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I always &s;tudy what the ladies like,&mdash;that's my fir&s;t thought. And, indeed, it is but natural that you &s;hould like be&s;t to &s;it by the gentlemen, for what can you find to &s;ay to one another?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Say!"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"O, never you think of that, they'll find enough to &s;ay, I'll be &s;worn. You know the women are never tired of talking."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come, Tom,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"don't be &s;evere upon the ladies; when I'm by; you know I always take their part."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, when Mi&s;s Branghton offered me &s;ome cake, this man of gallantry &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, if I was that lady, I'd never take any thing from a woman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why not, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I &s;hould be afraid of being poi&s;oned for being &s;o hand&s;ome."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is &s;evere upon the ladies <HI>now?</HI>"</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, really, Ma'am, it was a &s;lip of the tongue; I did not intend to &s;ay &s;uch a thing; but one can't always be on one's guard."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, the conver&s;ation turning upon pub|lic places, young Branghton a&s;ked if I had ever been to <HI>George</HI>'s at Hamp&s;tead?</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="269">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed I never heard the place mentioned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did n't you, Mi&s;s?"</Q> cried he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"why then you've a deal of fun to come, I'll promi&s;e you; and, I tell you what, I'll treat you there &s;ome Sunday &s;oon. So now, Bid and Poll, be &s;ure you don't tell Mi&s;s about the chairs, and all that, for I've a mind to &s;urpri&s;e her; and if I pay, I think I've a right to have it my own way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"George's at Hamp&s;tead!"</Q> repeated Mr. Smith, contemptuou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"how came you to think the young Lady would like to go to &s;uch a low place as that? But, pray, Ma'am, have you ever been to Don Saltero's at Chel&s;ea?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;No!&mdash;nay, then, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on hav|ing the plea&s;ure of conducting you there before long. I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am, many genteel people go, or el&s;e, I give you my word, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould not re|commend it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Cou&s;in,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"have you been to Sadler's Wells, yet?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No! why then you've &s;een nothing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid the Son, <Q REND="inline">"how do you like the Tower of London?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have never been to it, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s!"</Q> exclaimed he, <Q REND="inline">"not &s;een the Tower!&mdash;why may be you ha'n't been o' top of the Monument, neither?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, I have not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then you might as well not have come to London, for aught I &s;ee, for you've been no where."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Polly, <Q REND="inline">"have you been all over Paul's Church, yet?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="270">
<Q REND="inline">"Well, but, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"how do you like Vauxhall and Marybone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I never &s;aw either, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;God ble&s;s me!&mdash;you really &s;urpri&s;e me,&mdash;why Vauxhall is the fir&s;t plea&s;ure in life!&mdash;I know nothing like it.&mdash;Well, Ma'am, you mu&s;t have been with &s;taange people, indeed, not to have taken you to Vauxhall. Why you have &s;een nothing of London yet.&mdash;However, we mu&s;t try if <HI>we</HI> can't make you amends."</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this <HI>catechi&s;m,</HI> many other places were mentioned of which I have forgotten the names; but the looks of &s;urpri&s;e and contempt that my repeated negatives incurred, were very di|verting.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, after tea, <Q REND="inline">"as this Lady has been with &s;uch a queer &s;et of people, let's &s;hew her the difference; &s;uppo&s;e we go &s;omewhere to|night?&mdash;I love to do things with &s;pirit!&mdash;Come, Ladies, where &s;hall we go? For my part I &s;hould like Foote's,&mdash;but the Ladies mu&s;t chu&s;e; I never &s;peak my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Smith is always in &s;uch &s;pirits!"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Ma'am, yes, thank G&mdash;, pretty good &s;pirits;&mdash;I have not yet the cares of the world upon me,&mdash;I am not <HI>married,</HI>&mdash;ha, ha, ha,&mdash;you'll excu&s;e me, Ladies,&mdash;but I can't help laughing!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>No objection being made, to my great relief, we all proceeded to the little theatre in the Hay|market, where I was extremely entertained by the performance of the Minor and the Commi&s;&s;ary.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, Madame Duval again &s;ent me to Mr. Branghton's, attended by M. Du Bois, to make &s;ome party for the evening; be|cau&s;e &s;he had had the vapours the preceding day, from &s;taying at home.</P>
<P>As I entered the &s;hop, I perceived the unfortu|nate North Briton, &s;eated in a corner, with a book in his hand. He ca&s;t his melancholy eyes up, as we came in, and, I believe, immediately recol|lected my face, for he &s;tarted and changed colour. I delivered Madame Duval's me&s;&s;age to Mr. Branghton; who told me I &s;hould find Polly up &s;tairs, but that the others were gone out.</P>
<P>Up &s;tairs, therefore, I went; and, &s;eated on a window, with Mr. Brown at her &s;ide, &s;at Mi&s;s Polly. I felt a little awkward at di&s;turbing them, and much more &s;o, at their behaviour afterwards: for, as &s;oon as the common enquiries were over, Mr. Brown grew &s;o fond, and &s;o fooli&s;h, that I was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted. Polly, all the time, on|ly rebuked him with <Q REND="inline">"La, now, Mr. Brown, do be quiet, can't you?&mdash;you &s;hould not behave &s;o before company.&mdash;Why now what will Mi&s;s think of me?"&mdash;</Q>while her looks plainly &s;hewed not merely the plea&s;ure, but the pride which &s;he took in his care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I did not, by any means, think it nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h my&s;elf by witne&s;&s;ing their tenderne&s;s, and,
<PB N="257" REF="272">
therefore, telling them I would &s;ee if Mi&s;s Brangh|ton was returned home, I &s;oon left them, and again de&s;cended into the &s;hop.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So, Mi&s;s, you've come again,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"what, I &s;uppo&s;e, you've a mind to &s;it a little in the &s;hop, and &s;ee how the world goes, hay, Mi&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer; and M. Du Bois in&s;tantly brought me a chair.</P>
<P>The unhappy &s;tranger, who had ri&s;en at my en|trance, again &s;eated him&s;elf; and, though his head leant towards his book, I could not help ob|&s;erving, that his eyes were mo&s;t intently and ear|ne&s;tly turned towards me.</P>
<P>M. Du Bois, as well as his broken Engli&s;h would allow him, endeavoured to entertain us, till the return of Mi&s;s Branghton and her brother.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, how tired I am!"</Q> cried the former, <Q REND="inline">"I have not a foot to &s;tand upon."</Q> And then, without any ceremony, &s;he flung her&s;elf into the chair from which I had ri&s;en to receive her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You tired!"</Q> &s;aid the brother, <Q REND="inline">"why then what I mu&s;t be, that have walked twice as far?"</Q> And with equal politene&s;s, he paid the &s;ame com|pliment to M. Du Bois which his &s;i&s;ter had done to me.</P>
<P>Two chairs and three &s;tools compleated the fur|niture of the &s;hop, and Mr. Branghton, who cho&s;e to keep his own &s;eat him&s;elf, de&s;ired M. Du Bois to take another; and then, &s;eeing that I was with|out any, called out to the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"Come, Mr. Macartney, lend us your &s;tool."</Q></P>
<P>Shocked at their rudene&s;s, I declined the offer, and approaching Mi&s;s Branghton, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you will be &s;o good as to make room for me on your
<PB N="258" REF="273">
chair, there will be no occa&s;ion to di&s;turb that gentleman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, what &s;ignifies that?"</Q> cried the brother, <Q REND="inline">"he has had his &s;hare of &s;itting, I'll be &s;worn."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if he has not,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;i&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">he has a chair up &s;tairs; and the &s;hop is our own, I hope."</Q></P>
<P>This gro&s;sne&s;s &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted me, that I took the &s;tool, and carrying it back to Mr. Macartney my&s;elf, I returned him thanks, as civilly as I could, for his politene&s;s, but &s;aid that I had rather &s;tand.</P>
<P>He looked at me as if unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch at|tention, bowed very re&s;pectfully, but neither &s;poke, nor yet made u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found that I was an object of deri&s;ion to all pre&s;ent, except M. Du Bois, and, therefore, I begged Mr. Branghton would give me an an&s;wer for Madame Duval, as I was in ha&s;te to return.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, Tom,&mdash;Biddy,&mdash;where have you a mind to go to-night? your Aunt and Mi&s;s want to be abroad and among&s;t them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, Papa,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"we'll go to Don Saltero's. Mr. Smith likes that place, &s;o may be he'll go along with us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I'm for White-Conduit Hou&s;e; &s;o let's go there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"White-Conduit Hou&s;e, indeed!"</Q> cried his &s;i&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"no, Tom, that I won't."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then let it alone; nobody wants your company;&mdash;we &s;hall do as well without you, I'll be &s;worn, and better too."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you what, Tom, if you don't hold your tongue, I'll make you repent it,&mdash;that I a&s;|&s;ure you."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, Mr. Smith came into the &s;hop, which he &s;eemed to intend pa&s;&s;ing through; but when he &s;aw me, he &s;topped and began a mo&s;t courteous
<PB N="259" REF="274">
enquiry after my health, prote&s;ting that, had he known I was there, he &s;hould have come down &s;ooner. <Q REND="inline">"But, ble&s;s me, Ma'am,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"what is the rea&s;on you &s;tand?"</Q> and then he flew to bring me the &s;eat from which I had ju&s;t parted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Smith, you are come in very good time,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"to end a di&s;pute between my &s;on and daughter, about where they &s;hall all go to-night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie, Tom,&mdash;di&s;pute with a lady!"</Q> cried Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"Now, as for me, I'm for where you will, provided this young Lady is of the party,&mdash;one place is the &s;ame as another to me, &s;o that it be but agreeable to the ladies,&mdash;I would go any where with you, Ma'am,"</Q> (to me) <Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s, indeed, it were to <HI>church;</HI>&mdash;ha, ha, ha,&mdash;you'll excu&s;e me, Ma'am, but, really, I never could conquer my fear of a par&s;on;&mdash;ha, ha, ha,&mdash;really, ladies, I beg your pardon, for being &s;o rude, but I can't help laughing for my life!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was ju&s;t &s;aying, Mr. Smith,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould like to go to Don Sal|tero's;&mdash;now pray where &s;hould <HI>you</HI> like to go?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why really, Mi&s;s Biddy, you know I always let the ladies decide; I never fix any thing my&s;elf; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it would be rather hot at the coffee-hou&s;e,&mdash;however, pray, Ladies, &s;ettle it among your&s;elves,&mdash;I'm agreeable to whatever you chu&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>It was ea&s;y for me to di&s;cover, that this man, with all his parade of <HI>conformity,</HI> objects to every thing that is not propo&s;ed by him&s;elf: but he is &s;o much admired, by this family, for his <HI>gentility,</HI> that he thinks him&s;elf a complete fine gentleman!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"the be&s;t way will be to put it to the vote, and then every body
<PB N="260" REF="275">
will &s;peak their minds. Biddy, call Poll down &s;tairs. We'll &s;tart fair."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Papa,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"why can't you as well &s;end Tom?&mdash;you're always &s;end|ing me of the errands."</Q></P>
<P>A di&s;pute then en&s;ued, but Mi&s;s Branghton was obliged to yield.</P>
<P>When Mr. Brown and Mi&s;s Polly made their appearance, the latter uttered many complaints of having been called, &s;aying &s;he did not want to come, and was very well where &s;he was.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now, Ladies, your votes;"</Q> cried Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;o, Ma'am,"</Q> (to me) <Q REND="inline">"we'll begin with you. What place &s;hall you like be&s;t?"</Q> and then, in a whi&s;per, he added, <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall &s;ay the &s;ame as you do, whether I like it or not."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, that as I was ignorant what choice was in my power, I mu&s;t beg to hear their deci&s;ions fir&s;t. This was reluctantly a&s;&s;ented to; and then Mi&s;s Branghton voted for Saltero's Coffee-hou&s;e; her &s;i&s;ter, for a party to <HI>Mother Red Cap's;</HI> the bro|ther, for White-Conduit Hou&s;e; Mr. Brown, for Bagnigge Wells; Mr. Branghton for Sadler's Wells; and Mr. Smith for Vauxhall.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well now, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"we have all &s;poken, and &s;o you mu&s;t give the ca&s;ting vote. Come, what will you fix upon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"I was to &s;peak <HI>la&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;o you will,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"for we've all &s;poke fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline">"the voting has not yet been quite general."</Q></P>
<P>And I looked towards Mr. Macartney, to whom I wi&s;hed extremely to &s;hew that I was not of the &s;ame brutal nature with tho&s;e by whom he was treated &s;o gro&s;sly.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="276">
<Q REND="inline">"Why pray,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"who have we left out? would you have the cats and dogs vote?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> cried I, with &s;ome &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"I would have <HI>that gentleman</HI> vote,&mdash;if, indeed, he is not &s;u|perior to joining our party."</Q></P>
<P>They all looked at me, as if they doubted whe|ther or not they had heard me right: but, in a few moments, their &s;urpri&s;e gave way to a rude bur&s;t of laughter.</P>
<P>Very much di&s;plea&s;ed, I told M. Du Bois that if he was not ready to go, I would have a coach called for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>O yes, he &s;aid, he was always ready to attend me.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith then advancing, attempted to take my hand, and begged me not to leave them till I had &s;ettled the evening's plan.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have nothing, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"to do with it, as it is my intention to &s;tay at home; and therefore Mr. Branghton will be &s;o good as to &s;end Madame Duval word what place is fixed upon, when it is convenient to him."</Q></P>
<P>And then, making a &s;light courte&s;ie, I left them.</P>
<P>How much does my di&s;gu&s;t for the&s;e people en|crea&s;e my pity for poor Mr. Macartney! I will not &s;ee them when I can avoid &s;o doing; but I am de|termined to take every opportunity in my power, to &s;hew civility to this unhappy man, who&s;e mis|fortunes, with this family, only render him an object of &s;corn. I was, however, very well plea&s;|ed with M. Du Bois, who, far from joining in their mirth, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely &s;hocked at their ill-breeding.</P>
<P>We had not walked ten yards, ere we were fol|lowed by Mr. Smith, who came to make excu&s;es, and to a&s;&s;ure me they were <HI>only joking,</HI> and hoped
<PB N="262" REF="277">
I took nothing ill, for, if I did, he would make a quarrel of it him&s;elf with the Branghtons, rather than I &s;hould receive any offence.</P>
<P>I begged him not to take any trouble about &s;o immaterial an affair, and a&s;&s;ured him I &s;hould not my&s;elf. He was &s;o officious, that he would not be prevailed upon to return home, till he had walk|ed with us to Mr. Dawkin's.</P>
<P>Madame Duval was very much di&s;plea&s;ed that I brought her &s;o little &s;atisfaction. White-Conduit Hou&s;e was, at la&s;t, fixed upon; and, notwith|&s;tanding my great di&s;like of &s;uch parties and &s;uch places, I was obliged to accompany them.</P>
<P>Very di&s;agreeable, and much according to my expectations, the evening proved. There were many people all &s;mart and gaudy, and &s;o pert and low-bred, that I could hardly endure being among&s;t them; but the party to which, unfortunately, I belonged, &s;eemed all <HI>at home.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Holburn, <DATE>June 17th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY Mr. Smith carried his point, of making a party for Vauxhall, con&s;i&s;ting of Ma|dame Duval, M. Du Bois, all the Branghtons, Mr. Brown, him&s;elf,&mdash;and me!&mdash;for I find all en|deavours vain to e&s;cape any thing which the&s;e peo|ple de&s;ire I &s;hould not.</P>
<P>There were twenty di&s;putes previous to our &s;et|ting out; fir&s;t, as to the <HI>time</HI> of our going: Mr. Branghton, his &s;on, and young Brown, were for
<PB N="263" REF="278">
&s;ix o'clock; and all the ladies and Mr. Smith were for eight;&mdash;the latter, however, con|quered.</P>
<P>Then, as to the <HI>way</HI> we &s;hould go; &s;ome were for a boat, others for a coach, and Mr. Branghton him&s;elf was for walking: but the boat, at length, was decided upon. Indeed this was the only part of the expedition that was agreeable to me, for the Thames was delightfully plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The Garden is very pretty, but too formal; I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed, had it con&s;i&s;ted le&s;s of &s;trait walks, where
<Q><L>Grove nods at grove, each alley has its brother.</L></Q>
the trees, the numerous lights, and the company in the circle around the orche&s;tra make a mo&s;t bril|liant and gay appearance; and, had I been with a party le&s;s di&s;agreeable to me, I &s;hould have thought it a place formed for animation and plea|&s;ure. There was a concert, in the cour&s;e of which the hautbois concerto was &s;o charmingly played, that I could have thought my&s;elf upon enchanted ground, had I had &s;pirits more gentle to a&s;&s;ociate with. The hautboy in the open air is heavenly.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith endeavoured to attach him&s;elf to me, with &s;uch officious a&s;&s;iduity, and impertinent free|dom, that he quite &s;ickened me. Indeed, M. Du Bois was the only man of the party to whom, vo|luntarily, I ever addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf. He is civil and re&s;pectful, and I have found nobody el&s;e &s;o &s;ince I left Howard Grove. His Engli&s;h is very bad, but I prefer it to &s;peaking French my&s;elf, which I dare not venture to do. I conver&s;e with him frequently, both to di&s;engage my&s;elf from others, and to oblige
<PB N="264" REF="279">
Madame Duval, who is always plea&s;ed when he is attended to.</P>
<P>As we were walking about the orche&s;tra, I heard a bell ring, and, in a moment, Mr. Smyth, flying up to me, caught my hand, and, with a motion too quick to be re&s;i&s;ted, ran away with me many yards before I had breath to a&s;k his meaning, tho' I &s;truggled as well as I could to get from him. At la&s;t, however, I in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;topping; <Q REND="inline">"Stop|ping, Ma'am!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"why, we mu&s;t run on, or we &s;hall lo&s;e the ca&s;cade!</Q></P>
<P>And then again, he hurried me away, mixing with a crowd of people, all running with &s;o much ve|locity, that I could not imagine what had rai&s;ed &s;uch an alarm. We were &s;oon followed by the re&s;t of the party; and my &s;urpri&s;e and ignorance proved a &s;ource of diver&s;ion to them all, that was not exhau&s;ted the whole evening. Young Brangh|ton, in particular, laughed till he could hardly &s;tand.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the ca&s;cade I thought extremely pretty, and the general effect &s;triking and lively.</P>
<P>But this was not the only &s;urpri&s;e which was to divert them at my expence; for they led me about the garden, purpo&s;ely to enjoy my fir&s;t &s;ight of va|rious other deceptions.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, Mr. Smith having cho&s;en a <HI>box</HI> in a very con&s;picuous place, we all went to &s;up|per. Much fault was found with every thing that was ordered, though not a mor&s;el of any thing was left; and the dearne&s;s of the provi&s;ions, with con|jectures upon what profit was made by them, &s;up|plied di&s;cour&s;e during the whole meal.</P>
<P>When wine and cyder were brought, Mr. Smith &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now let's enjoy our&s;elves; now is the
<PB N="265" REF="280">
time, or never. Well, Ma'am, and how do you like Vauxhall?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Like it!"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"why, how can &s;he help liking it? &s;he has never &s;een &s;uch a place before, that I'll an&s;wer for."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For my part,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">I like it, becau&s;e it is not vulgar."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This mu&s;t have been a fine treat for you, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"why, I &s;uppo&s;e, you was never &s;o happy in all your life before?"</Q></P>
<P>I endeavoured to expre&s;s my &s;atisfaction with &s;ome plea&s;ure, yet I believe they were much ama|zed at my coldne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s ought to &s;tay in town till the la&s;t night,"</Q> &s;aid young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"and then, it's my belief, &s;he'd &s;ay &s;omething to it! Why, Lord, it's the be&s;t night of any; there's always a riot,&mdash;and there the folks run about,&mdash;and then there's &s;uch &s;quealing and &s;qualling!&mdash;and there all the lamps are broke,&mdash;and the women run &s;kimper &s;camper;&mdash;I declare I would not take five guineas to mi&s;s the la&s;t night!"</Q></P>
<P>I was very glad when they all grew tired of &s;it|ting, and called for the waiter to pay the bill. The Mi&s;s Branghtons &s;aid they would walk on, while the gentlemen &s;ettled the account, and a&s;ked me to accompany them; which, however, I de|clined.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You girls may do as you plea&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"but as to me, I promi&s;e you, I &s;ha'n't go no where without the gentlemen."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No more, I &s;uppo&s;e, will my <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, looking reproachfully towards Mr. Smith.</P>
<P>This reflection, which, I feared, would &s;latter his vanity, made me, mo&s;t unfortunately, reque&s;t
<PB N="266" REF="281">
Madame Duval's permi&s;&s;ion to attend them. She granted it, and away we went, having promi&s;ed to meet in the room.</P>
<P>To the room, therefore, I would immediately have gone; but the &s;i&s;ters agreed that they would fir&s;t have a <HI>little plea&s;ure,</HI> and they tittered, and talked &s;o loud, that they attracted univer&s;al no|tice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Polly,"</Q> &s;aid the elde&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uppo&s;e we were to take a turn in the dark walks!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, do,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and then we'll hide our&s;elves, and then Mr. Brown will think we are lo&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I remon&s;trated very warmly again&s;t this plan, telling them, that it would endanger our mi&s;&s;ing the re&s;t of the party all the evening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I thought how unea&s;y Mi&s;s would be, without a beau!"</Q></P>
<P>This impertinence I did not think worth an&s;wer|ing; and, quite by compul&s;ion, I followed them down a long alley, in which there was hardly any light.</P>
<P>By the time we came near the end, a large party of gentlemen, apparently very riotous, and who were hallowing, leaning on one another, and laugh|ing immoderately, &s;eemed to ru&s;h &s;uddenly from behind &s;ome trees, and, meeting us face to face, put their arms at their &s;ides, and formed a kind of circle, that fir&s;t &s;topped our proceeding, and then our retreating, for we were pre&s;ently entirely in|clo&s;ed. The Mi&s;s Branghtons &s;creamed aloud, and I was frightened exceedingly: our &s;creams were an&s;wered with bur&s;ts of laughter, and, for &s;ome minutes, we were kept pri&s;oners, till, at la&s;t, one of them, rudely, &s;eizing hold of me, &s;aid I was a pretty little creature.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="282">
Terrified to death, I &s;truggled with &s;uch vehe|mence to di&s;engage my&s;elf from him, that I &s;uc|ceeded, in &s;pite of his efforts to detain me; and immediately, and with a &s;wiftne&s;s which fear only could have given me, I flew rather than ran up the walk, hoping to &s;ecure my &s;afety by return+ing to the lights and company we had &s;o fooli&s;hly left: but, before I could po&s;&s;ibly accompli&s;h my purpo&s;e, I was met by another party of men, one of whom placed him&s;elf &s;o directly in my way, calling out, <Q REND="inline">"Whither &s;o fa&s;t, my love?"&mdash;</Q>that I could only have proceeded, by running into his arms.</P>
<P>In a moment both my hands, by different per|&s;ons, were caught hold of; and one of them, in a mo&s;t familiar manner, de&s;ired to accompany me in a race, when I ran next; while the re&s;t of the party &s;tood &s;till and laughed.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with terror, and &s;o breathle&s;s with running, that I could not &s;peak, till another advancing, &s;aid, I was as hand&s;ome as an angel, and de&s;ired to be of the party. I then ju&s;t articulated <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, Gentlemen, let me pa&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>Another then, ru&s;hing &s;uddenly forward, ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven and earth! what voice is that?&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The voice of the prettie&s;t little actre&s;s I have &s;een this age,"</Q> an&s;wered one of my per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;no,&mdash;no,&mdash;"</Q> I <HI>panted</HI> out, <Q REND="inline">"I am no actre&s;s,&mdash;pray let me go,&mdash;pray let me pa&s;s&mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By all that's &s;acred,"</Q> cried the &s;ame voice, which I then knew for Sir Clement Willoughby's, <Q REND="inline">"'tis her&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby!"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline">"O Sir, a&s;&s;i&s;t&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;t me&mdash;or I &s;hall die with terror!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="283">
<Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen,"</Q> cried he, di&s;engaging them all from me in an in&s;tant, <Q REND="inline">"pray leave this lady to me."</Q></P>
<P>Loud laughs proceeded from every mouth, and two or three &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Willoughby has all the luck!</HI>"</Q> But one of them, in a pa&s;&s;ionate manner, vowed he would not give me up, for that he had the fir&s;t right to me, and would &s;upport it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are mi&s;taken,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"this lady is&mdash;I will explain my&s;elf to you another time; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, you are all mi&s;taken."</Q></P>
<P>And then, taking my willing hand, he led me off, amid&s;t the loud acclamations, laughter, and gro&s;s merriment of his impertinent companions.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had e&s;caped from them, Sir Cle|ment with a voice of &s;urpri&s;e, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t creature, what wonder, what &s;trange revo|lution, has brought you to &s;uch a &s;pot as this?"</Q></P>
<P>A&s;hamed of my &s;ituation, and extremely morti|fied to be thus recognized by him, I was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and when he repeated his que&s;tion, only &s;tammered out, <Q REND="inline">"I have,&mdash;I hardly know how,&mdash;lo&s;t my&s;elf from my party.&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He caught my hand, and eagerly pre&s;&s;ing it, in a pa&s;&s;ionate voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"O that I had &s;ooner met with thee!"</Q></P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at a freedom &s;o unexpected, I angrily broke from him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Is this the protection you give me, Sir Clement?"</Q></P>
<P>And then I &s;aw what the perturbation of my mind had prevented my &s;ooner noticing, that he had led me, though I know not how, into an|other of the dark alleys, in&s;tead of the place whi|ther I meant to go.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> I cried, <Q REND="inline">"where am I?&mdash;what way are you going?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="284">
<Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hall be lea&s;t ob&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed at this &s;peech, I &s;topped &s;hort, and declared I would go no further.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why not, my angel?"</Q> again endeavour|ing to take my hand.</P>
<P>My heart beat with re&s;entment; I pu&s;hed him away from me with all my &s;trength, and demanded how he dared treat me with &s;uch in&s;olence?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In&s;olence!"</Q> repeated he.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir Clement, <HI>in&s;olence;</HI> from you, who know me, I had a claim for protection,&mdash;not to &s;uch treatment as this."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By Heaven,"</Q> cried he with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"you di&s;tract me,&mdash;why, tell me,&mdash;why do I &s;ee you here?&mdash;Is this a place for Mi&s;s Anville?&mdash;the&s;e dark walks!&mdash;no party!&mdash;no companion!&mdash;by all that's good, I can &s;carce believe my &s;en&s;es!"</Q></P>
<P>Extremely offended at this &s;peech, I turned an|grily from him, and, not deigning to make any an|&s;wer, walked on towards that part of the garden whence I perceived the lights and company.</P>
<P>He followed me; but we were both &s;ome time &s;ilent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So you will not explain to me your &s;ituation?"</Q> &s;aid he, at length.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, di&s;dainfully.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor yet&mdash;&s;uffer me to make my own inter|pretation&mdash;?"</Q></P>
<P>I could not bear this &s;trange manner of &s;peak|ing; it made my very &s;oul &s;hudder,&mdash;and I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>He flew to me, and actually flung him&s;elf at my feet, as if regardle&s;s who might &s;ee him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Anville&mdash;lovelie&s;t of women&mdash;forgive my&mdash;my&mdash;I be&s;eech you forgive me;&mdash;if I have
<PB N="270" REF="285">
offended,&mdash;if I have hurt you I could kill my&s;elf at the thought!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter, Sir, no matter,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"if I can but find my friends,&mdash;I will never &s;peak to&mdash;never &s;ee you again!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!&mdash;good Heaven!&mdash;my deare&s;t life, what is it I have done?&mdash;What is it I have &s;aid?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You be&s;t know, Sir, <HI>what</HI> and <HI>why;</HI>&mdash;but don't hold me here,&mdash;let me be gone, and do <HI>you!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not till you forgive me!&mdash;I cannot part with you in anger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For &s;hame, for &s;hame, Sir!"</Q> cried I indig|nantly, <Q REND="inline">"do you &s;uppo&s;e I am to be thus com|pelled?&mdash;do you take advantage of the ab&s;ence of my friends, to affront me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Madam,"</Q> cried he, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"I would &s;ooner forfeit my life than act &s;o mean a part. But you have flung me into amazement un&s;peakable, and you will not conde&s;cend to li&s;ten to my reque&s;t of giving me &s;ome explanation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The manner, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"in which you &s;poke that reque&s;t, made and will make me &s;corn to an&s;wer it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Scorn!&mdash;I will own to you, I expected not &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure from Mi&s;s Anville."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, if you had, you would le&s;s vo|luntarily have merited it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t life, &s;urely it mu&s;t be known to you, that the man does not breathe, who adores you &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, &s;o fervently, &s;o tenderly as I do!&mdash;why then will you delight in perplexing me?&mdash;in keeping me in &s;u&s;pence&mdash;in torturing me with doubt?"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I, Sir, delight in perplexing you!&mdash;You are much mi&s;taken.&mdash;Your &s;u&s;pence, your doubts, your perplexities,&mdash;are of your own creating; and,
<PB N="271" REF="286">
believe me, Sir, they may <HI>offend</HI> but they can never <HI>delight</HI> me:&mdash;but, as you have your&s;elf rai&s;ed, you mu&s;t your&s;elf &s;atisfy them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!&mdash;that &s;uch haughtine&s;s and &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s can inhabit the &s;ame man&s;ion!"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer, but quickening my pace, I walked on &s;ilently and &s;ullenly; till this mo&s;t im|petuous of men, &s;natching my hand, which he gra&s;ped with violence, be&s;ought me to forgive him, with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;upplication, that merely to e&s;cape his importunities, I was forced to &s;peak, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to grant the pardon he re|que&s;ted: though it was accorded with a very ill grace; but, indeed, I knew not how to re&s;i&s;t the humility of his entreaties: yet never &s;hall I recol|lect the occa&s;ion he gave me of di&s;plea&s;ure, with|out feeling it renewed.</P>
<P>We now &s;oon arrived in the mid&s;t of the general crowd, and my own &s;afety being then in&s;ured, I grew extremely unea&s;y for the Mi&s;s Branghtons, who&s;e danger, however imprudently incurred by their own folly, I too well knew how to tremble for. To this con&s;ideration all my pride of heart yielded, and I determined to &s;eek my party with the utmo&s;t &s;peed; though not without a &s;igh did I recollect the fruitle&s;s attempt I had made, after the opera, of concealing from this man my unfortunate connections, which I was now obliged to make known.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened therefore, to the room, with a view of &s;ending young Branghton to the aid of his &s;i&s;ters. In a very &s;hort time, I perceived Madame Duval, and the re&s;t, looking at one of the paintings. I mu&s;t own to you hone&s;tly, my dear Sir, that an involun|tary repugnance &s;eized me, at pre&s;enting &s;uch a &s;et to Sir Clement,&mdash;he, who had been u&s;ed to &s;ee
<PB N="272" REF="287">
me in parties &s;o different!&mdash;My pace &s;lackened as I approached them,&mdash;but they pre&s;ently perceived me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ah, Mademoi&s;elle!</HI>"</Q> cried M. Du Bois, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Que je &s;uis charme de vous voir!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried Mr. Brown, <Q REND="inline">"where's Mi&s;s Polly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Mi&s;s, you've been a long while gone,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"we thought you'd been lo&s;t. But what have you done with your cou&s;ins?"</Q></P>
<P>I he&s;itated,&mdash;for Sir Clement regarded me with a look of wonder.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ha'n't let you leave me again in a hurry. Why, here we've been in &s;uch a fright!&mdash;and all the while, I &s;uppo&s;e you've been thinking nothing about the matter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"as long as Mi&s;s is come back, I don't mind, for as to Bid and Poll, they can take care of them&s;elves. But the be&s;t joke is, Mr. Smith is gone all about a looking for you."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peeches were made almo&s;t all in a breath: but when, at la&s;t, they waited for an an&s;wer, I told them, that in walking up one of the long al|leys, we had been frightened and &s;eparated.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The long alleys!"</Q> repeated Mr. Brangh|ton, <Q REND="inline">"and, pray, what had you to do in the long alleys? why, to be &s;ure, you mu&s;t all of you have had a mind to be affronted!"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech was not more impertinent to me, than &s;urpri&s;ing to Sir Clement, who regarded all the party with evident a&s;toni&s;hment. However, I told young Branghton that no time ought to be lo&s;t, for that his &s;i&s;ters might require his immediate protection.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how will they get it?"</Q> cried this brutal brother; <Q REND="inline">"if they've a mind to behave in &s;uch a
<PB N="273" REF="288">
manner as that, they ought to protect them&s;elves; and &s;o they may for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;imple Mr. Brown, <Q REND="inline">"whe|ther you go or no, I think I may as well &s;ee after Mi&s;s Polly."</Q></P>
<P>The father then, interfering, in&s;i&s;ted that his &s;on &s;hould accompany him; and away they went.</P>
<P>It was now that Madame Duval fir&s;t perceived Sir Clement; to whom turning with a look of great di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he angrily &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> &s;o you are comed here, of all the people in the world!&mdash;I wonder, child, you would let &s;uch a&mdash;&s;uch a <HI>per&s;on</HI> as that keep company with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"if I have been &s;o unfor|tunate as to offend you; but I believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Mi&s;s Anville, when you hear that I have been &s;o happy as to do her &s;ome &s;ervice."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Madame Duval, with her u&s;ual <HI>Ma foi,</HI> was beginning to reply, the attention of Sir Cle|ment was wholly drawn from her, by the appear|ance of Mr. Smith, who &s;uddenly coming behind me, and freely putting his hands on my &s;houlders, cried, <Q REND="inline">"O ho, my little runaway, have I found you at la&s;t? I have been &s;campering all over the gardens for you; for I was determined to find you, if you were above ground.&mdash;But how could you be &s;o cruel as to leave us?"</Q></P>
<P>I turned round to him, and looked with a degree of contempt that I hoped would have quieted him; but he had not the &s;en&s;e to under&s;tand me; and, attempting to take my hand, he added, <Q REND="inline">"Such a demure looking lady as you are, who'd have thought of your leading one &s;uch a dance?&mdash;Come, now,
<PB N="274" REF="289">
don't be &s;o coy,&mdash;only think what a trouble I have had in running after you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The trouble, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"was of your own choice&mdash;not mine."</Q> And I walked round to the other &s;ide of Madame Duval.</P>
<P>Perhaps I was too proud,&mdash;but I could not en|dure that Sir Clement, who&s;e eyes followed him with looks of the mo&s;t &s;urprized curio&s;ity, &s;hould witne&s;s his unwelcome familiarity.</P>
<P>Upon my removal, he came up to me, and, in a low voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are not, then, with the Mirvans?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray&mdash;may I a&s;k,&mdash;have you left them long?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How unfortunate I am!&mdash;but ye&s;terday I &s;ent to acquaint the Captain I &s;hould reach the Grove by to-morrow noon! However I &s;hall get away as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. Shall you be long in town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">And then, when you leave it,&mdash;which way&mdash;will you allow me to a&s;k, which way you &s;hall travel?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,&mdash;I don't know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not know!&mdash;But do you return to the Mir|vans any more?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I&mdash;I can't tell, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>And then, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Madame Duval, with &s;uch a pretended earne&s;tne&s;s, that he was ob|liged to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As he cannot but ob&s;erve the great change in my &s;ituation, which he knows not how to account for, there is &s;omething in all the&s;e que&s;tions, and this unre&s;trained curio&s;ity, that I did not expect from a man, who when he plea&s;es can be &s;o well|bred, as Sir Clement Willoughby. He &s;eems di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="275" REF="290">
to think that the alteration in my compa|nions authorizes an alteration in his manners. It is true, he has always treated me with uncom|mon freedom, but never before with &s;o di&s;re&s;pect|ful an abruptne&s;s. This ob&s;ervation, which he has given me cau&s;e to make, of his <HI>changing with the tide,</HI> has &s;unk him more in my opinion, than any other part of his conduct.</P>
<P>Yet I could almo&s;t have laughed, when I looked at Mr. Smith, who no &s;ooner &s;aw me addre&s;&s;ed by Sir Clement, than, retreating aloof from the company, he &s;eemed to lo&s;e at once all his happy &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and conceit; looking now at the baronet, now at him&s;elf, &s;urveying, with &s;orrow|ful eyes, his dre&s;s, &s;truck with his air, his ge&s;|tures, his ea&s;y gaiety; he gazed at him with en|vious admiration, and &s;eemed him&s;elf, with con|&s;cious inferiority, to &s;hrink into nothing.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Brown, running up to us, called out, <Q REND="inline">"La, what, i'n't Mi&s;s Polly come yet?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"why, I thought you went to fetch her your&s;elf did n't you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, but I could n't find her;&mdash;yet I dare &s;ay I've been over half the garden."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Half! but why did not you go over it all?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, &s;o I will: but only I thought I'd ju&s;t come and &s;ee if &s;he was here fir&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But where's Tom?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I don't know; for he would not &s;tay with me, all as ever I could &s;ay; for we met &s;ome young gentlemen of his acquaintance, and &s;o he bid me go and look by my&s;elf, for he &s;aid, &s;ays he, I can divert my&s;elf better another way, &s;ays he."</Q></P>
<P>This account being given, away again went this &s;illy young man; and Mr. Branghton, extremely
<PB N="276" REF="291">
incen&s;ed, &s;aid he would go and &s;ee after them him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So now,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"he's gone too! why, at this rate we &s;hall have to wait for one or other of them all night!"</Q></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Sir Clement &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to renew his enquiries, I turned towards one of the paintings, and, pretending to be very much occu|pied in looking after it, a&s;ked M. Du Bois &s;ome que&s;tions concerning the figures.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, <HI>Mon Dieu!</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"don't a&s;k him; your be&s;t way is to a&s;k Mr. Smith, for he's been here the oftene&s;t. Come, Mr. Smith, I dare &s;ay you can tell us all about them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, who, brightening up at this application, advanced to|wards us, with an air of a&s;&s;umed importance (which, however, &s;at very unea&s;ily upon him) and begged to know what he &s;hould explain fir&s;t; <Q REND="inline">"For I have attended,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to all the&s;e paintings, and know every thing in them perfectly well; for I am rather fond of pictures, Ma'am; and, really, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I think a picture is a&mdash;a very&mdash;is real|ly a very&mdash;is &s;omething very pretty&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So do I too,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"but pray now, Sir, tell us who that is meant for,"</Q> pointing to a figure of Neptune.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That!&mdash;why that, Ma'am, is,&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me, I can't think how I come to be &s;o &s;tupid, but really I have forgot his name,&mdash;and yet, I know it as well as my own, too,&mdash;however, he's a <HI>general,</HI> Ma'am, they are all generals."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aw Sir Clement bite his lips; and, indeed, &s;o did I mine.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"it's the odde&s;t dre&s;s for a general ever I &s;ee!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="292">
<Q REND="inline">"He &s;eems &s;o capital a figure,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Cle|ment to Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"that I imagine he mu&s;t be <HI>generali&s;&s;imo</HI> of the whole army."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Smith, re&s;pect|fully bowing, and highly delighted at being thus referred to, <Q REND="inline">"you are perfectly right,&mdash;but I can|not for my life think of his name;&mdash;perhaps, Sir, you may remember it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No really,"</Q> replied Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"my ac|quaintance among the generals is not &s;o exten|&s;ive."</Q></P>
<P>The ironical tone of voice in which Sir Cle|ment &s;poke, entirely di&s;concerted Mr. Smith; who, again retiring to an humble di&s;tance, &s;eemed &s;en|&s;ibly mortified at the failure of his attempt to reco|ver his con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Branghton returned with his younge&s;t daughter, whom he had re&s;cued from a party of in&s;olent young men; but he had not yet been able to find the elde&s;t. Mi&s;s Polly was really frightened, and declared &s;he would never go into the dark walks again. Her father, leaving her with us, went in que&s;t of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>While &s;he was relating her adventures, to which nobody li&s;tened more attentively than Sir Clement, we &s;aw Mr. Brown enter the room. <Q REND="inline">"O la!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Polly, <Q REND="inline">"let me hide my&s;elf, and don't tell him I'm come."</Q></P>
<P>She then placed her&s;elf behind Madame Duval, in &s;uch a manner that &s;he could not be &s;een.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So Mi&s;s Polly is not come yet!"</Q> &s;aid the &s;im|ple &s;wain; <Q REND="inline">"well, I can't think where &s;he can be! I've been a looking, and looking, and looking all about, and I can't find her, all I can do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but, Mr. Brown,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ha'n't you go and look for the lady again?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="293">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;itting down, <Q REND="inline">"but I mu&s;t re&s;t me a little bit fir&s;t. You can't think how tired I am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie, Mr. Brown, fie,"</Q> cried Mr. Smith, winking at us, <Q REND="inline">"tired of looking for a lady! Go, go, for &s;hame!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I will, Sir, pre&s;ently; but you'd be tired too, if you'd walked &s;o far: be&s;ides, I think &s;he's gone out of the garden, or el&s;e I mu&s;t have &s;een &s;omething or other of her."</Q></P>
<P>A <HI>he, he, he!</HI> of the tittering Polly, now be|trayed her, and &s;o ended this ingenious little arti|fice.</P>
<P>At la&s;t appeared Mr. Branghton and Mi&s;s Biddy, who, with a face of mixed anger and confu&s;ion, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"So Mi&s;s, &s;o you ran away from me! Well, &s;ee if I don't do as much by you, &s;ome day or other! But I thought how it would be, you'd no mind to leave the <HI>gen|tlemen,</HI> though you'd run away from <HI>me.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at this attack, that I could not an&s;wer her for very amazement; and &s;he proceeded to tell us how ill &s;he had been u&s;ed, and that two young men had been making her walk up and down the dark walks by ab&s;olute force, and as fa&s;t as ever they could tear her along; and many other particulars, which I will not tire you with relating. In conclu&s;ion, looking at Mr. Smith, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"But, to be &s;ure, thought I, at lea&s;t all the company will be looking for me; &s;o I little expected to find you all here, talking as comfortably as ever you can. However, I know I may thank my cou&s;in for it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you mean <HI>me,</HI> Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, very much &s;hocked, <Q REND="inline">"I am quite ignorant in what manner I can have been acce&s;&s;ary to your di&s;tre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="294">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, by running away &s;o. If you'd &s;tayed with us, I'll an&s;wer for it, Mr. Smith and M. Du Bois would have come to look for us; but I &s;uppo&s;e they could not leave your lady&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P>The folly and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this &s;peech would admit of no an&s;wer. But what a &s;cene was this for Sir Clement! his &s;urpri&s;e was evi|dent; and, I mu&s;t acknowledge, my confu&s;ion was equally great.</P>
<P>We had now to wait for young Branghton, who did not appear for &s;ome time; and, during this in|terval, it was with difficulty that I avoided Sir Clement, who was on the rack of curio&s;ity, and dying to &s;peak to me.</P>
<P>When, at la&s;t, the hopeful youth returned, a long and frightful quarrel en&s;ued between him and his father, in which his &s;i&s;ters occa&s;ionally joined, concerning his neglect; and he defended him&s;elf only by a brutal mirth, which he indulged at their expence.</P>
<P>Every one, now, &s;eemed inclined to depart,&mdash;when, as u&s;ual, a di&s;pute aro&s;e, upon the <HI>way</HI> of our going, whether in a coach or a boat. After much debating, it was determined that we &s;hould make two parties, one by the water and the other by land; for Madame Duval declared &s;he would not, upon any account, go into a boat at night.</P>
<P>Sir Clement then &s;aid, that if &s;he had no car|riage in waiting, he &s;hould be happy to &s;ee her and me &s;afe home, as his was in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>Fury &s;tarted into her eyes, and pa&s;&s;ion inflamed every feature, as &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI> no,&mdash;you may take care of your&s;elf, if you plea&s;e; but as to me, I promi&s;e you I &s;ha'n't tru&s;t my&s;elf with no &s;uch per&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="295">
He pretended not to comprehend her meaning, yet, to wave a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, acquie&s;ced in her refu|&s;al. The coach party fixed upon con&s;i&s;ted of Ma|dame Duval, M. Du Bois, Mi&s;s Branghton, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I now began to rejoice, in private, that, at lea&s;t, our lodgings would be neither &s;een, nor known, by Sir Clement. We &s;oon met with an hackney-coach, into which he handed me, and then took leave.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, having already given the coach|man her direction, he mounted the box, and we were ju&s;t driving off, when Sir Clement exclaim|ed, <Q REND="inline">"By Heaven, this is the very coach I had in waiting for my&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This coach, your honour!"</Q> &s;aid the man, <Q REND="inline">"no, that it i'nt."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement, however, &s;wore that it was, and, pre&s;ently, the man, begging his pardon, &s;aid he had really forgotten that he was engaged.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but that this &s;cheme occurred to him at the moment, and that he made &s;ome &s;ign to the coachman, which induced him to &s;upport it: for there is not the lea&s;t probability that the acci|dent really happened, as it is mo&s;t likely his own chariot was in waiting.</P>
<P>The man then opened the coach-door, and Sir Clement advancing to it, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I don't believe there is another carriage to be had, or I would not incommode you: but, as it may be di&s;agreeable to you to wait here any longer, I beg you will not get out, for you &s;hall be &s;et down before I am car|ried home, if you will be &s;o good as to make a lit|tle room."</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, in he jumpt, and &s;eated him&s;elf between M. Du Bois and me, while our a&s;toni&s;h|ment
<PB N="281" REF="296">
at the whole tran&s;action was too great for &s;peech. He then ordered the coachman to drive on, according to the directions he had already re|ceived.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t ten minutes, no one uttered a word; and then, Madame Duval, no longer able to con|tain her&s;elf, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> if this is n't one of the impudente&s;t things ever I &s;ee!"</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement, regardle&s;s of this rebuke, attended only to me; however, I an&s;wered nothing he &s;aid, when I could po&s;&s;ibly avoid &s;o doing. Mi&s;s Brangh|ton made &s;everal attempts to attract his notice, but in vain, for he would not take the trouble of pay|ing her any regard.</P>
<P>Madame Duval, during the re&s;t of the ride, ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to M. Du Bois in French, and in that language exclaimed with great vehemence again&s;t boldne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>I was extremely glad when I thought our jour|ney mu&s;t be nearly at an end, for my &s;ituation was very unea&s;y to me, as Sir Clement perpetually en|deavoured to take my hand. I looked out of the coach-window, to &s;ee if we were near home; Sir Clement, &s;tooping over me did the &s;ame, and then, in a voice of infinite wonder, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Where the d&mdash;l is the man driving to?&mdash;why we are in Broad St. Giles's!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, he's very right,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o never trouble your head about that, for I &s;han't go by no directions of yours, I promi&s;e you."</Q></P>
<P>When, at la&s;t, we &s;topped, at <HI>an Ho&s;ier's</HI> in <HI>High Holborn,</HI>&mdash;Sir Clement &s;aid nothing, but his <HI>eyes,</HI> I &s;aw, were very bu&s;ily employed in view|ing the place, and the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e. The coach he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;ettling him&s;elf, as he &s;aid it belonged to him; and then he took leave. M. Du

Bois walked home with Mi&s;s Branghton, and Ma|dame Duval and I retired to our apartments.</P>
<P>How di&s;agreeable an evening's adventure! not one of the party &s;eemed &s;atisfied, except Sir Cle|ment, who was in high &s;pirits: but Madame Du|val was enraged at meeting with him; Mr. Brangh|ton, angry with his children; the frolick of the Mi&s;s Branghtons had exceeded their plan, and end|ed in their own di&s;tre&s;s; their brother was provo|ked that there had been no riot; Mr. Brown was tired; and Mr. Smith mortified. As to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t acknowledge, nothing could be more di&s;agree|able to me, than being &s;een by Sir Clement Wil|loughby with a party at once &s;o vulgar in them|&s;elves, and &s;o familiar to me.</P>
<P>And you, too, my dear Sir, will, I know, be &s;orry that I have met him; however, there is no apprehen&s;ion of his vi&s;iting here, as Madame Du|val is far too angry to admit him.</P>
