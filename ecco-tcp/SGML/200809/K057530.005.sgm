<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CURSORY GLANCE AT LAW FICTIONS. LEGAL SUPPOSITIONS ENDLESS. THE PROFESSIONAL JARGON OF AN ATTORNEY. AN ENQUIRY INTO THE INTEGRITY OF BARRISTERS AND THE EQUITY OF DECISIONS AT LAW. A. AND B. OR A CASE STATED. A DIGRESSION FROM LAW TO PHILOSOPHY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, my application to the law was ince&s;&s;ant; and con&s;equently my intercour&s;e with lawyers daily in|crea&s;ed. I endeavoured to load my brain with technical terms and phra&s;es, to un|der&s;tand technical di&s;tinctions, and to acquaint my&s;elf with the hi&s;tory of law fictions, and the rea&s;ons on which they had been founded.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">To the&s;e &s;ubjects my attention had been turned by Mr. Hilary; who, being a Solicitor, was well acquainted with the value of them, to the man who meant to make him&s;elf a thorough lawyer.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of this branch of law &s;taggered my judgment. Trottman and Hilary were intimate. The latter had invited us and other friends to din|ner; and, as I found the acutene&s;s of Trottman u&s;eful to me in my pur&s;uits, I took this and every occa&s;ion to put que&s;tions: which he was very ready to an&s;wer. As it happened, my enquiry on the &s;ubject of law fictions brought on the following dialogue: which was &s;up|ported by Trottman entirely in his own &s;tyle.</P>
<P>"According to your account then," &s;aid I, in an&s;wer to a previous remark, "in <HI>Banco Regis</HI> the King is always <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed</HI> to be pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"No doubt, what que&s;tion can there be
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of that? One invi&s;ible kind of being can as ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed as another. And I hope you will not di&s;pute the actual pre|&s;ence of that plea&s;ant gentleman called the devil, in any one of our courts?"</P>
<P>"By no means!"</P>
<P>"As for his maje&s;ty, he, God ble&s;s him! by the nature of his office is <HI>hic et ubique:</HI> here, there, and every where. He is borne in &s;tate before each Corporation Mayor, whether Mr. or My Lord; and repo&s;es peacefully in front of Mr. Speak|er, or the Lord High Chancellor: in|ve&s;ting them by his &s;acred pre&s;ence with all their power."</P>
<P>"How &s;o?"</P>
<P>"How &s;o! Do you forget the mace upon the table?"</P>
<P>"Authority then has that virtue that, like grace divine into a wafer, it can be transfu&s;ed into wood."</P>
<P>"Yes. A lord's white wand, a gene|ral's
<PB N="4" REF="6">
baton; a con&s;table's &s;taff. It is thought nece&s;&s;ary, I grant, in &s;ome of the&s;e ca&s;es that the block &s;hould be carved and gilded."</P>
<P>"Well, the po&s;ition is that, in <HI>Banco Regis,</HI> the King is always pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"So &s;ays the law."</P>
<P>"But the law, it appears, tells a lie; and, from all that I have heard, I wi&s;h it were the only one that it told."</P>
<P>"Could the law hear, &s;ir, it would take very grave offence at your language. It only a&s;&s;umes a fiction."</P>
<P>"John Doe and Richard Roe, who are the pledges of pro&s;ecution, are two more of its <HI>&s;uppo&s;es,</HI> or lies. I beg pardon. I &s;hould have &s;aid fictions."</P>
<P>"Why, yes: con&s;idering that John Doe and Richard Roe never made their per&s;onal appearance in any court in the kingdom, were never once met, in hou&s;e, &s;treet, or field, in public, or in private,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
nay had never yet the good luck to be born, they have really done a deal of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"They re&s;emble Legion, entering the &s;wine: they plunge whole herds into the depths of de&s;truction."</P>
<P>"Or, if you will, they are a kind of real yet invi&s;ible hob-goblins: by whom every human being is liable to be haunt|ed. It mu&s;t however be allowed of them that they are a pair of very active and convenient per&s;ons."</P>
<P>"To lawyers. But God help the re&s;t of mankind! Are there many of the&s;e fictions?"</P>
<P>"More than I or any man, I believe, can at one time remember."</P>
<P>"From the little I have read, this ap|pears to be a very puzzling part of the profe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Not at all; if we will take things as we find them, and neither be more curious nor &s;queami&s;h than wi&s;e. I
<PB N="6" REF="8">
will &s;tate the proce&s;s of a &s;uit to you; and you will then perceive how plain and &s;traight-forward it is. We will &s;up|po&s;e A the plaintiff: B the defendant. A brings his action by bill. Action you know means this: <HI>Actio nihil aliud e&s;t quam jus pro&s;equendi in judicium quod &s;ibi debetur:"</HI> or, "a right of pro&s;ecuting to judgment, for what is due to one's &s;elf." B is and was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be in the cu&s;tody of the Mar&s;hal. Ob&s;erve, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed to be:</HI> for very likely B is walking unmole&s;ted in his garden; or what not. B we will &s;ay happens to live in Surry, Kent, or any other county, except Middle&s;ex; and is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to have made his e&s;cape, though perhaps he may have broken his leg, and never have been out of his own door. And then the latitat <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that a bill had i&s;&s;ued, and further <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that it has been returned <HI>non e&s;t inventus,</HI> and moreover <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> it to have been filed. B lives in Kent, you know; and this
<PB N="7" REF="9">
latitat is addre&s;&s;ed, in <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> to the Sheriff of the county, greeting; though as to the Sheriff he neither &s;ees, hears, nor knows any thing concerning it; and informs him that B (notwith&s;tanding he is confined to his bed by a broken leg) runs up and down, in <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> and &s;ecretes him&s;elf in the Sheriff's county of Kent: on which &mdash;"</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon: I cannot follow you through all this labyrinth of <HI>&s;up|po&s;es."</HI></P>
<P>"No! Then you will never do for a lawyer: for I have but ju&s;t begun. I &s;hould carry you along an endle&s;s chain of them; every link of which is con|nected."</P>
<P>"And which chain is frequently &s;trong enough to bind and impri&s;on both plain|tiff and defendant."</P>
<P>"Certainly: or the law would be as dead in its &s;pirit as it is in its letter."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">"I fear I &s;hall never get all the phra&s;es and forms of law by rote."</P>
<P>"Why, no. If you did, heaven help you! it would breed a fine confu&s;ion in your brain. You would become as litigious and as unintelligible as our friend Stradling.</P>
<P>"Mr. Stradling," &s;aid Hilary, "is one of my clients: an unfortunate man who, being a law-printer, has in the way of trade read &s;o many law-books, and accu&s;tomed him|&s;elf to &s;uch a peculiar jargon, as to ima|gine that he is a better lawyer than any of us; &s;o that he has half-ruined him|&s;elf by litigation. He is to dine with us, and will &s;oon be here."</P>
<P>"I will provoke him," continued Trott|man, "to afford you a &s;ample of his gib|beri&s;h; you may then examine what de|gree of in&s;truction you &s;uppo&s;e may be obtained from a heterogeneous top&s;y-tur|vy ma&s;s of law phra&s;es."</P>
<P>"But why irritate your friend?"</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">"You mi&s;take. He has it &s;o eternally on his tongue that, in&s;tead of giving him pain to &s;hew the various methods in which he &s;uppo&s;es he could torment an anta|goni&s;t at law, it affords him the highe&s;t gratification."</P>
<P>"Our friend Hilary here is better qua|lified for the ta&s;k of in&s;truction; but he feels &s;ome of your qualms; and is now and then inclined to doubt that there is vice, in the glorious &s;y&s;tem which regu|lates all our actions."</P>
<P>"I deny that it regulates them," &s;aid Hilary. "If people in general had no more knowledge of right and wrong than they have of law, their actions would in|deed be wretchedly regulated!"</P>
<P>This was a &s;agacious remark. It made an impre&s;&s;ion upon me that was not for|gotten. It &s;ugge&s;ted the important truth that the preten&s;ions of law to govern are ridiculous; and that men act, as Hilary
<PB N="10" REF="12">
ju&s;tly affirmed, well or ill according to their &s;en&s;e of right and wrong.</P>
<P>Mr. Stradling &s;oon after came; and Trottman very artfully led him into a di&s;pute on a &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, which Trott|man pretended to defend, and aggra|vated him, by contradiction, till Strad|ling roundly affirmed his opponent knew nothing of conducting a &s;uit at law.</P>
<P>The volubility of this gentleman was extraordinary; and the trouble I thought my&s;elf obliged to be&s;tow, at that time, on the &s;ubject could alone have enabled me to remember any part off the jargon he uttered, in oppo&s;ition to Trottman: which in &s;ub&s;tance was as follows.</P>
<P>"Give me leave to tell you, friend Trottman, you know nothing of the mat|ter; and I &s;hould be very glad I could provoke you to meet me in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. If I had you but in the Courts, damn me if you &s;hould ea&s;ily get out!"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">"I tell you once more I would not leave you a coat to your back."</P>
<P>"You! Lord help you! I would <HI>tra|ver&s;e</HI> your indictment, <HI>demur</HI> to your plea, bring my <HI>writ of error, non&s;uit</HI> you. Sir, I would <HI>ca &s;a fi fa</HI> you. I would <HI>bar</HI> you. I would <HI>latitat</HI> you, <HI>replevin</HI> you, <HI>refalo</HI> you. I would have my <HI>non e&s;t inventus,</HI> my <HI>alias,</HI> and <HI>pluries,</HI> and <HI>pluries,</HI> and <HI>pluries, ad infinitum.</HI> I would have you in <HI>trover</HI>; in <HI>detinue</HI>; I would &s;end your loving friend Richard Roe to you. I would <HI>eject</HI> you. I would make you <HI>confe&s;s lea&s;e entry and ou&s;ter.</HI> I would file my <HI>bill of Middle&s;ex</HI>; or my <HI>latitat</HI> with an <HI>ac etiam.</HI> Nay, I would be a wor&s;e plague to you &s;till: I would have my bill filed in B. R. I would furni&s;h you with a &s;pecial original for C. P. You talk! I would &s;ue out my <HI>capias, alias,</HI> and <HI>plu|ries,</HI> at once; and outlaw you before you &s;hould hear one word of the proceed|ing."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">Ble&s;s me, thought I, what innumerable ways there are of reducing a man to beg|gary and de&s;truction according to law!</P>
<P>Trottman thus provokingly continued.</P>
<P>"My dear Mr. Stradling, your brain is bewildered. You go backward and for|ward, from one &s;uppo&s;ition to another, and from proce&s;s to proce&s;s, till you really don't know what you &s;ay. If I were your opponent, in any Court in the kingdom, I &s;hould certainly make the law provide you a lodging for the re&s;t of your life."</P>
<P>"Bring your action! That's all! Bring your action, and ob&s;erve how finely I will <HI>nonpros</HI> you: or reduce you to a <HI>nolle pro&s;equi.</HI> You think your&s;elf knowing? P&s;haw. I have non&s;uited fifty more cun|ning fellows, in my time; and &s;hall do fifty more."</P>
<P>God help them! thought I.</P>
<P>"I have laid many a pert put by the heels. You pretend to carry an action through the Courts with me! Why, &s;ir,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
I have helped to ruin three men of a thou&s;and a year; and am in a fair way, at this very hour, of doing as much for a Baronet of five times the property."</P>
<P>I li&s;tened in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"And do you take a plea&s;ure in re|membering this?" &s;aid Hilary.</P>
<P>"Plea&s;ure!" an&s;wered Stradling; &s;tar|ing. "Why, do you think, Mr. Hilary, I &s;hould have taken a plea&s;ure in ruining my&s;elf? What did I do but act accord|ing to the laws of my country? And, if men will oppo&s;e me, and pretend to un|der&s;tand tho&s;e laws better than I do, let them pay for their ignorance and their pre&s;umption. Let them re&s;pect the law, or let their brats go beg."</P>
<P>"The law I find, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "has no compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Compa&s;&s;ion, indeed! No, &s;ir. Com|pa&s;&s;ion is a fool; and the law is wi&s;e."</P>
<P>"In it&s;elf I hope it is: but I own I doubt the wi&s;dom of its practice."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">"But this practice, you mu&s;t know," &s;aid Trottman, with a wink to Stradling, "Mr. Trevor means to reform."</P>
<P>"Oh," replied Stradling, "then I &s;up|po&s;e, when the gentleman is at the bar, he will never accept a brief, till he has fir&s;t examined the equity of the ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"That, &s;ir," I replied, "is my firm intention."</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, ha! Mr. Trevor, you are a young man! You will know better in time."</P>
<P>"And do you imagine, &s;ir, that I will ever hire my&s;elf to chicanery, and be the willing promoter of fraud? If I do, may I live hated, and die de&s;pi&s;ed!"</P>
<P>"Ay, ay! Very true! I don't remem|ber that I ever met with a youth, who had ju&s;t begun to keep his terms, who did not profe&s;s much the &s;ame. And, which is well worthy of remark, tho&s;e that have been mo&s;t vehement in the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions have been mo&s;t famous, when
<PB N="15" REF="17">
they came to the bar, for undertaking and gaining the rottene&s;t cau&s;es."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall find however, &s;ir, that I &s;hall be an exception to this rule."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, Mr. Trevor, for not too ha&s;tily crediting ha&s;ty a&s;&s;ertions. I know mankind as well as I know the law. However, I can only tell you that if your practice keep pace with your profe&s;&s;ions, you will never be Lord Chief Ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"Do the judges then encourage bar|ri&s;ters, who undertake the defence of bad and ba&s;e actions?"</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure they do. They &s;ome|times &s;hake their heads and look grave: but we know very well they defended &s;uch them&s;elves: or, as I tell you, they would never have been judges. If two men have a di&s;pute, one of them mu&s;t be in the wrong. And who is able to pro|nounce which, except the law?"</P>
<P>"My dear Mr. Stradling," &s;aid Trott|man, "you are again out of your depth.
<PB N="16" REF="18">
When two men di&s;pute, it almo&s;t always happens that they are both in the wrong. And this is the glorious re&s;ource of law; and the refuge of its coun&s;ellors, and its judges."</P>
<P>Trottman and Stradling were accu&s;|tomed to each other's manner; and, notwith&s;tanding the language they u&s;ed, nothing more was meant than a kind of jocular &s;parring: which would now and then forget it&s;elf for a moment, and be|come wa&s;pi&s;h; but would recollect and recover its temper the next &s;entence.</P>
<P>I replied to Trottman &mdash; "It is true that, when two men di&s;pute, it generally happens they are both in the wrong. But one is always more in the wrong than the other; and it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of lawyers to examine, and of the law to decide upon, their different degrees of error."</P>
<P>"What, &s;ir!" exclaimed Stradling. "If you were coun&s;el in a cau&s;e for plain|tiff
<PB N="17" REF="19">
A, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing the blunders and wrongs of defendant B, would you enquire into tho&s;e of your own client?"</P>
<P>"I would enquire impartially into both."</P>
<P>"And if you knew any circum&s;tance which would infallibly in&s;ure plaintiff a non&s;uit, you would declare it to the Court?"</P>
<P>"I would declare the truth, and the whole truth."</P>
<P>"Here's doctrine! Here's law!"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Trottman; "it is not law. It is reform."</P>
<P>"It ought to be law. As an advocate, I am a man who hire out my knowledge and talents for the avowed purpo&s;e of doing ju&s;tice; and am to con&s;ider nei|ther plaintiff nor defendant, but ju&s;tice only. Otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould certainly be the vile&s;t of ra&s;cals!"</P>
<P>"Heyday!" thundered Stradling: and, after a pau&s;e, added&mdash;"It is my
<PB N="18" REF="20">
opinion, tho&s;e words are liable to a pro|&s;ecution, Mr. Trevor; and, by G&mdash;, if you were to be ca&s;t in any one of our Courts for them, it would be no fault either of the bench or the bar if the &s;en|tence of the law, which you are defam|ing, did not &s;hut you up for life!"</P>
<P>"My friend Trevor mi&s;takes the na|ture of the profe&s;&s;ion he is &s;tudying," added Trottman. "He forgets that the que&s;tion before a Court is not, what is this, that, or the other; which he may think proper to call ju&s;tice; but, what is the law?"</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure, &s;ir;" continued Strad|ling. "It is that which, as a lawyer, you mu&s;t attend to; and that only."</P>
<P>"I will cite you an example," &s;aid Trottman.</P>
<P>"A was a gentleman of great landed property. B was an impertinent beg|garly kind of &s;turdy fellow, his neigh|bour. A had an e&s;tate in the county of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&mdash; that lay in a ring-fence: a mea|dow of nine acres excepted, which be|longed to B. This meadow it was conve|nient for A to purcha&s;e; and he &s;ent his &s;teward, who was an attorney, to make propo&s;als. B rejected them. The &s;tew|ard advi&s;ed A to buy the e&s;tate that be|longed to C, but that was farmed by B. The advice was followed. The lea&s;e of B expired the following year; and a new one was denied by A, unle&s;s B would &s;ell his meadow. B con&s;ented. A bought the meadow, but determined to have his revenge. For this purpo&s;e A refu&s;ed payment, and provoked B to commence an action. The law he knew very well was on the &s;ide of B: but that was of little con&s;equence. Plaintiff B brought his action in Trinity Term. Defend|ant A pleaded a &s;ham plea: a&s;&s;erted plaintiff had been paid for his meadow, by a firkin of butter: [All a lie, you
<PB N="20" REF="22">
know.] long vacation was thus got over, and next term defendant files a bill in Chancery, to &s;tay proceedings at law. Plaintiff B files his an&s;wer, and gets the injunction di&s;&s;olved: but A had his writ ready and became plaintiff in error, car|ried it through all the Courts: from K. B. to the Exchequer-chamber; and from the Exchequer-chamber, as A very well knew that B had no more money, A brought error into Parliament: by which B was obliged to drop proceedings. His attorney, of cour&s;e, would not &s;tir a &s;tep further; and the fool was ruined. He was afterward arre&s;ted by his attorney for payment of bill in arrear; and he now lies in pri&s;on, on the debtors'-&s;ide of Newgate."</P>
<P>"How you &s;tare, Mr. Trevor!" added Stradling. "Every word true. We all know a great lord who has carried I can|not tell how many &s;uch cau&s;es."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">"And were the judges," &s;aid I, "ac|quainted with the whole of the&s;e proceed|ings?"</P>
<P>"How could they be ignorant of them? Judgment had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t de|fendant A in all the Courts."</P>
<P>"And did they afford the plaintiff no protection?"</P>
<P>"They protect! Why, Mr. Trevor, you imagine your&s;elf in Turkey, telling your tale to a Cady, who decides accord|ing to his notions of right and wrong; and not pleading in the pre&s;ence of a bench of Engli&s;h judges, who have twice ten thou&s;and volumes to con&s;ult as their guides which leave them no opinion of their own. It is their duty to pronounce &s;entence as the &s;tatute-books direct: or, as in the ca&s;e I have cited, according to precedent, time immemorial."</P>
<P>"And this is what you call law?"</P>
<P>"Ay! and &s;ound law too."</P>
<P>"Why then, damn the &mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">"You do right to &s;top &s;hort, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"It appears to me that I am travelling in a cur&s;ed dirty as well as thorny road," &s;aid I, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Why, to own the truth," added Trottman, "you mu&s;t meet with a little &s;pla&s;hing: and, unle&s;s you can turn back and look at it with unconcern, I &s;hould &s;carcely advi&s;e you to proceed."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall certainly recon&s;ider the &s;ub|ject!"</P>
<P>"A pair of lawyers, like a pair of legs, are apt to be&s;patter each other: but they neverthele&s;s remain good friends and brothers. If you &s;end your &s;paniel into a muddy pool, you ought to take care, when he comes out, that he does not &s;hake the filth he has collected over his ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"I wonder, &s;ir, that you &s;hould con|tinue one of a profe&s;&s;ion which you treat with &s;uch un&s;paring &s;everity."</P>
<P>"And I, &s;ir, do not wonder at your
<PB N="23" REF="25">
wonderings. Life is a long road; and he mu&s;t have travelled a very little way indeed who expects that it &s;hould be all a bowling-green. Pur&s;ue your route in which direction you will, law, trade, phy|&s;ic, or divinity, and prove to me that you will never have occa&s;ion to &s;hake off the du&s;t from your feet in te&s;timony again&s;t it, and I will then pau&s;e and con&s;ider. You are of the &s;ect of the Perfectibles."</P>
<P>"And you of the ca&s;t of the Stand-&s;tills."</P>
<P>"Oh no. I conceive my&s;elf to be among children at a fair, riding in a round-about. Like the globe they in|habit, men are continually in motion: but they can never pa&s;s their circle."</P>
<P>"And do you &s;uppo&s;e you know the limits of your circle?"</P>
<P>"Within a trifle. The experience of &s;tate, empires, and ages has decided that que&s;tion with tolerable accuracy."</P>

<P>"It is the art of printing.

<P>"The <HI>argumentum ad hominem.</HI> Very &s;weet and delectable. Thank you, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"Every thing is &s;ubject to change: why not therefore to improvement? That change is inevitable there are proofs look where you will: that which is called innovation mu&s;t con&s;equently be indi&s;|pen&s;ible. Examine the hi&s;tory of your own &s;cience. When England was in|fe&s;ted with wolves, we are told that King Edgar impo&s;ed an annual tribute of thir|ty wolves' heads on the Wel&s;h Princes; that the breed might be extirpated. Had this tribute been levied, after the race was partly de&s;troyed, the law would have
<PB N="26" REF="28">
counteracted its own intention: for, in order to pay the tax, the tributary Princes mu&s;t have encouraged the breed; and once more have &s;tocked the country with wolves."</P>
<P>Stradling was little better than in|fected with what have been lately &s;tigma|ti&s;ed by the appellation of Jacobinical principles, and exclaimed, with great ex|ultation&mdash;"Your remark is very true, &s;ir; and it is an example that will &s;erve admirably well to illu&s;trate another point. Placemen and pen&s;ioners, a race more ravenous and infinitely more de&s;tructive than wolves, have been propagated for the &s;upport of the Executive Govern|ment; and the breed increa&s;es &s;o rapid|ly that it will very &s;oon devour its feed|ers."</P>
<P>"And next it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"With all my heart! Let me but &s;ee that vermin extirpated, and I &s;hall die in peace!"</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">"Very right, Mr. Stradling;" &s;aid Trottman, with great gravity. "Place|men, and pen&s;ioners are vile vermin! And &s;o will remain, till your party comes into office."</P>
<P>"If ever I could be brought to accept of place, or pen&s;ion, may I &mdash;!"</P>
<P>"I believe you: for I am well per|&s;uaded your virtue will never be put to the trial. Otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould ima|gine, it would find as many good argu|ments, I mean precedents, in favour of the regular practice in politics as in law."</P>
<P>Here our dialogue pau&s;ed. Dinner was announced, and law, politics, and pa|trioti&s;m were for a while forgotten, by all except my&s;elf, in the enjoyments of ve|ni&s;on and old port.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE PAINFUL DOUBTS, AND FURTHER ENQUIRIES. UNEXPECTED ENCOURAGEMENT AND WARM AF|FECTIONS FROM A CHARACTER BEFORE SUP|POSED TO BE TOO COLD. HOPE STRENGTHENED AND CONFIRMED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>DESULTORY as the conver&s;ation I have recited had been, it left a very deep impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind. It was round|ly a&s;&s;erted, by every lawyer to whom I put the que&s;tion, that the whole and &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of a coun&s;ellor was the defence of his client. Right or wrong, it was his duty to gain his cau&s;e; and, with re&s;pect to the ju&s;tice of it, into that, generally &s;peaking, it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould enquire. Briefs were frequently put into his hand as he entered the Court; which he was to follow as in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>It did now and then happen that a cau&s;e was &s;o infamous as to put even the
<PB N="29" REF="31">
hacknied brow of a barri&s;ter to the blu&s;h: but it mu&s;t be a vile one indeed! And even then, when he threw up his brief, though paid before he began to plead, it was matter of admiration to meet &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted an example of virtue, in an ad|vocate.</P>
<P>It was in the practice of the law that I hoped to have taken refuge, again&s;t the arguments of Turl: which, aver&s;e as I had been to li&s;ten, proved even to me that, in principle, it was not to be de|fended.</P>
<P>The train of thinking that followed the&s;e deductions was &s;o very painful that I was obliged to fly from them; and &s;eek advice and confirmation in the friend&s;hip of Wilmot, before I &s;hould write on the &s;ubject to Mr. Evelyn. For the latter ta&s;k indeed my mind was not yet &s;uffi|ciently calm, collected, and determined.</P>
<P>My chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;olation was that the &s;ub|ject had thus been &s;trongly brought to
<PB N="30" REF="32">
the te&s;t of enquiry, before the expiration of the month which, according to agree|ment, I was to be with Coun&s;ellor Ven|tilate, previous to the payment of my ad|mi&s;&s;ion-fee; of which, as it was a heavy one, thus to have robbed the charities of Mr. Evelyn would have given me exce&s;|&s;ive angui&s;h.</P>
<P>I know not whether I was &s;orry or glad when I came to Wilmot's lodging, to find Turl there. He had returned from his bathing excur&s;ion; having been call|ed back &s;ooner than he expected by his affairs.</P>
<P>He was cheerful, and in excellent &s;pi|rits. His complexion was clear, his health improved, and his joy at our meeting was evident and unaffected. He even owned that, hearing I had devoted my|&s;elf to the law, he had returned thus &s;oon the more willingly once again to argue the que&s;tion with me: for that he felt him&s;elf very highly intere&s;ted in the fu|ture
<PB N="31" REF="33">
employment of talents of which he had conceived extraordinary hopes; and that he thought it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be devoted to &s;uch a confu&s;ing &s;tudy, were there no other objection to it, as that of the law, without being, not only perverted and abu&s;ed, but, in a great de|gree, &s;tifled.</P>
<P>After an avowal like this, it required an effort in me to &s;ummon up my re&s;o|lution, and hone&s;tly &s;tate the doubts and difficulties that had ari&s;en in my own mind. It was happy for me that my friends were men who&s;e habitual &s;incerity prompted me to a &s;imilar conduct. I therefore took courage, opened my heart, and, while de&s;cribing my own &s;en&s;ations, was impelled to confe&s;s that the practice of the law could with great difficulty in|deed be reconciled to the principles of undeviating hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>"I mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoice," &s;aid Turl, "that the&s;e doubts have been &s;ugge&s;ted
<PB N="32" REF="34">
to you by other people, rather than by me: for I am very de&s;irous you &s;hould not continue to think me too prone to cen&s;ure. And, in addition to them, I would have you take a retro&s;pect of your plan. To induce you to de&s;pond is a thing which I would mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly avoid: but to &s;uffer you to delude your|&s;elf with the hopes of &s;udden wealth (and when I &s;ay &s;udden, I would give you a term of ten years) from the practice of the law, unle&s;s you &s;hould plunge into that practice with the mo&s;t unqualified di&s;regard to all that rectitude demands, would be to act the cowardly di&s;inge|nuous hypocrite; and entirely to forget the fir&s;t and be&s;t duties of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Should you a&s;k&mdash;'What path then am I to pur&s;ue?' I own I am totally at a lo&s;s for an an&s;wer. The choice mu&s;t be left to your&s;elf. You are not ignorant that it is infinitely more ea&s;y to point out mi&s;takes, which have been and &s;till con|tinue
<PB N="33" REF="35">
to be committed daily, than to teach how they may be entirely avoided. Of this I am well a&s;&s;ured, if you will con|fide in and exert tho&s;e powers of mind that you po&s;&s;e&s;s; they mu&s;t lead you to a degree of happine&s;s of the enjoyment of which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, but few are ca|pable.</P>
<P>"From my own experience and from that of all the young men I meet, who are thrown upon the world, I find that the period which is mo&s;t critical and full of danger, is the one during which they are obliged un&s;upported to &s;eek a grate|ful and worthy way of employing their talents.</P>
<P>"My own re&s;ource has been that of cheerfully &s;ubmitting to what are called the hard&s;hips of ob&s;cure poverty; and of con&s;oling my&s;elf, not only with a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that by this cour&s;e in time I &s;hall infallibly change the &s;cene, but that, till this time &s;hall come, I am employing
<PB N="34" REF="36">
my&s;elf on the &s;ubjects which can be&s;t afford me pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction. That is, in endeavours, however narrow and feeble, to enlarge the boundaries of human hap|pine&s;s; and by means like the&s;e to find a &s;ufficiency for my own &s;upport.</P>
<P>"I know not that I ought to advi&s;e you to pur&s;ue a &s;imilar plan: though I can truly &s;ay I am unacquainted with any other, which is equally promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>"How to an&s;wer or appea&s;e the imperi|ous demands of your pre&s;ent ruling pa&s;&s;ion I cannot devi&s;e. Neither can I &s;ay that I am convinced it is blameable except in its exce&s;s. That you &s;hould de&s;ire to obtain &s;o &s;o rare and ine&s;timable a trea&s;ure as that of a woman who, not to in&s;i&s;t upon her peculiar beauty, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the high faculties with which &s;he whom you love is affirmed to be endowed, is an ambition which my heart knows not how to con|demn as unworthy. There is &s;omething in it &s;o congenial to all my own feelings
<PB N="35" REF="37">
that to &s;ee you united to her would give me inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear me own that, notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;tacles are &s;o numerous that I have no perception of the manner in which they are to be overcome, I yet rejoice with you that you have di&s;covered &s;uch a wo|man; that &s;he has a&s;&s;uredly a rooted affection for you; and that you have thus obtained one advantage over all your friends, a &s;trong and unconquerable mo|tive to out&s;trip them in your efforts.</P>
<P>"Shall I add that, de&s;perate as your ca&s;e &s;eems to be, I participate in your &s;anguine hopes? I do not deem them entirely romantic, but &s;hare in that which the phlegmatic would call the frenzy of your mind; and half-per&s;uade my&s;elf that you will finally be victorious.</P>
<P>"Then &s;ummon up your fortitude. Do not &s;uffer the failure of ill-concerted plans either to le&s;&s;en your ardour or give
<PB N="36" REF="38">
it a ra&s;h and dangerous direction. Be cool in deci&s;ion, warm in pur&s;uit, and unwearied in per&s;everance. Time is a never failing friend, to tho&s;e who have the di&s;cernment to profit by the oppor|tunities he offers. Let your eye be on the alert, and your hand active and firm, as circum&s;tances &s;hall occur, and I &s;hall then &s;ay I &s;carcely know what it is that you may not hope to achieve!"</P>
<P>Wilmot &s;tood with his head re&s;ting on his arm, leaning again&s;t the mantle-piece. When Turl began, his eye was ca&s;t down, a compa&s;&s;ionate melancholy over&s;pread his countenance, and a deep &s;igh broke from him unperceived by him&s;elf. As our mutual friend proceeded, his attitude altered, his head was rai&s;ed, his eye brightened, his features glowed, his &s;oul was wrapt in the vi&s;ions which were rai&s;ed by Turl, and, uncon&s;cious of his own exi&s;tence or that he &s;poke, his interrupting ejaculations now and then involuntarily
<PB N="37" REF="39">
bur&s;t forth&mdash;"That is true!"&mdash;Well argued!&mdash;Do you think &s;o?&mdash;Indeed!&mdash; I am glad of that!&mdash;Don't de&s;pond, Trevor!&mdash;Don't de&s;pond!&mdash;'Tis folly to de&s;pond!"</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he repeated the la&s;t &s;entence, "'Tis folly to de&s;pond," &s;o full a remem|berance of his former trains of thought came over him, and there was &s;o divine a mixture of hope and melancholy in his face, which &s;eemed &s;o to reproach him|&s;elf and to encourage me, that, divided as my feelings were between the generous emanations of Turl and the&s;e torrents of affection from a man who had &s;uffered &s;o deeply, I &s;eized the hand of each, pre&s;&s;ed them both to my heart, in&s;tantly dropped them again, covered my face, fell again&s;t the wall, and &s;obbed with &s;omething like hy&s;teric pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of all the plea&s;ures of which the &s;oul is capable, tho&s;e of friend&s;hip for man and love for woman are the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite.

They may be de&s;cribed as&mdash;"the comprehen&s;ive principle of benevolence, which binds the whole human race to aid and love each other, individualized; and put into its utmo&s;t &s;tate of activity." Selfi&s;hne&s;s may deride them; and there may be &s;ome &s;o haunted by &s;u&s;picion, or &s;o hardened in vice as to doubt or deny their exi&s;tence. But he that has felt them in their fulle&s;t force has the be&s;t as well as the grande&s;t &s;tandard of human nature; and the pure&s;t foreta&s;te of the joys that are in &s;tore, for the generations that are to come.</P>
<P>This is the &s;pirit that is to harmonize the world; and give reality to tho&s;e ideal gardens of paradi&s;e, and ages of gold, the po&s;&s;ibility of which, as the records of fable &s;hew, could &s;carcely e&s;cape even &s;avage ignorance.</P>
<P>What clue &s;hall I give the reader to my heart, that &s;hall lead him into its re|ce&s;&s;es; and enable him to conceive its

entire &s;en&s;ations? That Turl, from whom I imagined I had met &s;o much di&s;courage|ment, who&s;e &s;crutinizing eye led him to examine with &s;uch &s;everity, and who&s;e firm under&s;tanding po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch powers of right deci&s;ion, that he &s;hould not only &s;ympathize with me but partake in my be&s;t hopes, and countenance me in my &s;oul's deare&s;t pur&s;uit, that Turl &s;hould feel and act thus, was a joy inconceivably great, and unexpected!</P>
<P>He now no longer appeared to me as one to whom, though I could not but revere him, I dur&s;t not confe&s;s my&s;elf; but as a generous, anxious, and tender friend. My former fla&s;hes of hope had u&s;ually been &s;ucceeded by a gloomy de&s;pair, that made me half &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf to be frantic: but, after this conce&s;&s;ion and encouragement from Turl, they &s;eemed in&s;tantly to &s;pring into con&s;i&s;t|ency, probability, and &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Turl highly approved my forbearance,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
and caution, re&s;pecting the letter I had written and was &s;o anxious to convey to Olivia.</P>
<P>This farther coincidence of opinion not only induced me to per&s;evere in my plan, but afforded me a degree of grate|ful &s;atisfaction, and &s;elf-re&s;pect, that was exceedingly con&s;olatory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE TRAITS OF THE CHARACTER OF MR. EVE|LYN. A NEW PROJECT OF A VERY FLATTERING NATURE. BOROUGH INTEREST AND A PATRI|OTIC BARONET.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that Turl was induced to enquire, and I to explain, the means by which I &s;hould have been en|abled to pur&s;ue the &s;tudy of the law: for he had heard of my misfortunes, and the di&s;&s;ipation of my finances.</P>
<P>This brought the behaviour and cha|racter
<PB N="41" REF="43">
of Mr. Evelyn in review: and the admiration of Turl, with the terms of affection and re&s;pect in which he &s;poke of that gentleman, was additional delight. He had never entertained any &s;erious doubt, he &s;aid, but that &s;uch men ex|i&s;ted: perhaps many of them: yet to di&s;cover a &s;ingle one was an unexpected and, to &s;ay the truth, a very uncommon plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But Mr. Evelyn was to be made ac|quainted with my change of &s;entiment; and of my being once more de&s;titute of any plan for my future guidance. It was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould not deem me a man of un&s;ettled principles; frivo|lous in propen&s;ity, and fanta&s;tic in con|duct. For, though perhaps my pride would have felt gratification at no longer con&s;idering my&s;elf a dependent on the favourable opinion or calculations which another might form concerning me, and
<PB N="42" REF="44">
my good or ill qualities, yet I could not endure to &s;ink in his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>I therefore applied my&s;elf, immediate|ly, in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous manner, to col|lect and &s;tate &s;uch facts as I had gathered, relative to the practice of the law: and, that the argument might be placed in the cleare&s;t light po&s;&s;ible, I begged of Turl to take that part of the &s;ubject which related to its principles upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus provided, I wrote to Mr. Eve|lyn; and my letter was fortunate enough to produce its de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>Nor was he &s;atisfied with mere appro|bation. His anxious and generous friend|&s;hip would not &s;uffer him to re&s;t; and he immediately made a journey to town, to con&s;ult with me, &s;ince this project was rejected, what &s;hould be my new pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>His behaviour verified all the a&s;&s;ertions of his former di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the
<PB N="43" REF="45">
hopes that he had conceived of my ta|lents. He con&s;idered nothing within the &s;cope of his fortune as too great a &s;acrifice, if it could but promote the end he de&s;ired. For this purpo&s;e he not only con&s;ulted with Wilmot, and Turl, but led me into &s;uch conver&s;ations as might be&s;t di&s;play the bent of my genius; and afford him hints, on which to act.</P>
<P>And now he was induced to form a de&s;ign &s;uch as I little expected; and which required of me the acceptance of obligations &s;o great as well might &s;tagger me, and render it difficult for me to con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>He had remarked that my enunciation was clear and articulate, my language flowing, my voice powerful, and my manner prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. Such were the terms which he u&s;ed; in de&s;cribing the&s;e qualities in me. The youthful manline&s;s of my figure, he &s;aid, added to the pro|perties I have mentioned, was admirably
<PB N="44" REF="46">
adapted for parliamentary oratory. My elocution and deportment were com|manding; and principles &s;uch as mine might awe corruption it&s;elf into re&s;pect, and aid to rou&s;e a nation, and enlighten a world. Mr. Evelyn, like my&s;elf, was very much of an enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P>He did not immediately communicate the project to me: which was indeed fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to him by accidental cir|cum&s;tances: but previou&s;ly examined whether it was, as he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be, po&s;&s;ible to be carried into effect.</P>
<P>Sir Barnard Bray had the nomina|tion of two borough members: one of which he per&s;onated him&s;elf, and di&s;po&s;ed of the other &s;eat, as is the cu&s;tom, to a candidate who &s;hould be of his party; and con&s;equently vote according to his opinion.</P>
<P>He had long been the loud and fa&s;t friend of Oppo&s;ition. No man was more determined in detecting error, more hot
<PB N="45" REF="47">
in his zeal, or more vociferous in accu|&s;ation, than Sir Barnard: his dear and intimate friend, the right honourable Mr. Ab&s;tract, excepted; who was indeed pepper, or rather gunpowder it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was the cou&s;in of this patriotic baronet.</P>
<P>It happened ju&s;t then to be the eve of a general election; and, as the la&s;t mem|ber of Sir Barnard had been &s;o profligate, or &s;o patriotic, as the worthy member him&s;elf repeatedly and &s;olemnly declared he was, as to vote with the Mini&s;ter, who had previou&s;ly given him a place and promi&s;ed to &s;ecure his return for a Trea|&s;ury borough, Mr. Evelyn, knowing the&s;e circum&s;tances, was per&s;uaded that the Baronet would be happy to find a repre&s;entative for <HI>his</HI> con&s;tituents, who&s;e eloquence added to his own &s;hould avenge him on the Mini&s;ter; if not tumble him from the throne he had u&s;urped.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn and the Baronet were on
<PB N="46" REF="48">
intimate terms: for Sir Barnard took a particular plea&s;ure in every man who per|fectly agreed with him in opinion; and, though this definition would not ac|curately apply to Mr. Evelyn, yet, on the great leading points in politics they &s;eldom differed.</P>
<P>As to morals, as a &s;cience, Sir Barnard on many occa&s;ions would affect to treat it with that common-place contempt which always accompanies the &s;uppo&s;ition of the original and unconquerable de|pravity of man; of the verity of which the Baronet had a rooted conviction. In this hypothe&s;is he was but confirmed by his burgage-tenure voters, by the conduct of the members he had him&s;elf returned, and by certain propen&s;ities which he felt in his own brea&s;t, and which he &s;eriou&s;ly believed to be in&s;tinctive in man.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, if Mr. Evelyn differed at any time in opinion with a di&s;putant, the &s;ua|vity of his manners was &s;o conciliatory
<PB N="47" REF="49">
that oppo&s;ition, from him, was &s;ometimes better received than agreement, and co|incidence, from other people. This &s;ua|vity, by the by, is a delightful art. Would it were better under&s;tood, and more practi&s;ed!</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FULL of the project he had conceived, Mr. Evelyn vi&s;ited the Baronet, who happened to be in town, and propo&s;ed it to him in the manner which he thought might mo&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him in my favour.</P>
<P>Sir Barnard li&s;tened attentively, and pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>It happened that he had lately been
<PB N="48" REF="50">
meditating on the danger of introducing young orators into parliament: for he had found, by experience, that they are &s;o marketable a commodity as to be al|mo&s;t certain of being bought up. The trick he had him&s;elf been played was bitterly remembered; and he had known and heard of &s;everal in&s;tances, during his parliamentary career, of a &s;imilar kind.</P>
<P>Yet he could not but recollect that, when he and his former &s;poke&s;man had entered the hou&s;e, arm in arm, there was a &s;ort of buzz, and a degree of re&s;pect paid to him, which had in&s;tantly dimi|ni&s;hed as &s;oon as this &s;upport was gone.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething of dignity in the u&s;e of crutches; and he that cannot walk alone commands attention, from his im|becility.</P>
<P>"I do not know what to think of this plan," &s;aid the Baronet. "I find your flowery &s;peakers are no more to be de|pended

upon, in the pre&s;ent day, than the olde&s;t drudges in corruption!</P>
<P>"You know, cou&s;in, how I hate cor|ruption. It is undoing us all. It will undo the nation! The influence of the crown is mon&s;trous.

There is ab&s;olutely no &s;uch thing as patrioti&s;m exi&s;ting; and, to own the truth, damn me if I believe there is a man in the kingdom that cares one far|thing
<PB N="50" REF="52">
for tho&s;e rights and liberties, about which &s;o many people that you and I know pretend to bawl!"</P>
<P>"This is a &s;evere &s;uppo&s;ition indeed. It implicates your deare&s;t and mo&s;t in|timate friends. Only recollect, Sir Bar|nard, what would your feelings be, if the &s;ame thing &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted of you?"</P>
<P>"Of me, truly! No, no, cou&s;in Eve|lyn; I think I have been pretty tolerably tried! The Mini&s;ter knows very well he could move the Monument &s;ooner than me. I love the people; and am half mad to &s;ee that they have no love for them|&s;elves. Why do not they meet? Why do not they petition? Why do not they be&s;iege the throne with their clamors? They are no better than bea&s;ts of bur|then! If they were any thing el&s;e, the whole kingdom would ri&s;e, as one man, and drive this arrogant up&s;tart from the helm. I &s;ay, Mr. Evelyn, I love the people; I love my country; I love the
<PB N="51" REF="53">
con&s;titution; and I hate the &s;warms of mu&s;hroom peers, and petty traders, that are daily pouring in upon us, to overturn it."</P>
<P>Was it weakne&s;s of memory? Was it the blindne&s;s of egoti&s;m? Or was it in|ordinate &s;tupidity, that Sir Barnard &s;hould forget, as he con&s;tantly did, that his fa|ther had been a common porter in a warehou&s;e, had rai&s;ed an immen&s;e for|tune by trade, had purcha&s;ed the boroughs which de&s;cended to his &s;on, and had him&s;elf been bought with the title of Baronet by a former mini&s;ter? Was it &s;o very long ago, that Sir Barnard, with &s;uch a &s;well of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, &s;hould begin to talk of the antiquity of his family? But, above all, how did he happen not to recollect that the di&s;ap|pointment which now preyed upon and cankered his heart was the refu&s;al of a peerage?</P>
<P>I really can give no &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer
<PB N="52" REF="54">
to the&s;e que&s;tions. I can only &s;tate a fact: which daily occurs in a thou&s;and other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn brought the Baronet back to the point; and remarked to him that, at the pre&s;ent period, when the Mini&s;ter was &s;o powerful in numbers, to bring in a mere yes and no member with him&s;elf would be a certain mode of not &s;erving the country, the con&s;titution, and the people, whom he &s;o dearly loved; that the &s;afety which is derived from a man's in&s;ignificance is but a bad pledge; and that he thought him&s;elf very certain I was as dear, nay and as incorruptible, a lover of old England, or at lea&s;t of the wel|fare of mankind, as Sir Barnard him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Shew me &s;uch a man, cou&s;in," ex|claimed the Baronet, "and I will wor&s;hip him! I will wor&s;hip him, Mr. Evelyn! I will wor&s;hip him! But I am per&s;uaded he is not to be found. I have learned, from too fatal experience, that I am certain of no|body
<PB N="53" REF="55">
but my&s;elf! Small as the number in Oppo&s;ition is, if they were but all as &s;ound-hearted as I am, and would &s;et their &s;houlders to the wheel and lay them&s;elves out for the good of their coun|try as I do, I &s;ay it, Mr. Evelyn, and take my word for it I &s;ay true, we &s;hould overturn the Mini&s;ter and his corrupt gang in &s;ix months! Nay, in half the time! However, as you are &s;o &s;trongly per&s;uaded of the &s;oundne&s;s of the gentle|man's principles whom you recommend, let me &s;ee him, and talk to him; and then I will tell you more of my opinion."</P>
<P>"There is one point, Sir Barnard, on which I &s;uppo&s;e I need not in&s;i&s;t; it is &s;o obvious."</P>
<P>"What is that, cou&s;in?"</P>
<P>"You being as you &s;tate a man of principle, and incapable of being bia&s;&s;ed to act again&s;t what you conceive to be the good of the nation, you mu&s;t expect that every man, who re&s;embles you in
<PB N="54" REF="56">
patrioti&s;m and fortitude, will act from him&s;elf, and will re&s;i&s;t any attempt to control him."</P>
<P>"Oh, as to that, we need &s;ay nothing about it. Tho&s;e things are never men|tioned, now-a-days: they are perfectly under&s;tood. But who is your young friend? Is he a man of property?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>He will be the more manageable, thought Sir Barnard.</P>
<P>"Where will he get a qualification?"</P>
<P>"I will provide him with one."</P>
<P>"You &s;ay he is a gentleman."</P>
<P>"As I under&s;tand the term, he cer|tainly is: for, in addition to tho&s;e man|ners and accompli&s;hments which are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the world, he not only po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a good education but a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice which makes him regard every man as his brother; and which will nei|ther &s;uffer him to crouch to the haughty nor trample on the poor."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">"Why, that is very good. Very right. I my&s;elf will crouch to no man. And, as for mode&s;ty and humility, in the youth of the pre&s;ent day, why they are very rarely found: and &s;o I &s;hall be happy to meet with them."</P>
<P>"Nay, but Mr. Trevor delivers his &s;entiments with rather an unguarded freedom, and with peculiar energy or indeed he would be ill qualified to ri&s;e in the a&s;&s;embly of which I wi&s;h to &s;ee him a member, and undauntedly oppo&s;e the arrogant a&s;&s;ertions that are there daily made."</P>
<P>"Arrogant! G&mdash; confound me, Mr. Evelyn, if I am not &s;ometimes &s;truck dumb, with what I hear in that hou&s;e! There is that Scotchman in particular, who will get up, after our allies have been defeated, our troops driven like &s;heep from &s;wamp to &s;wamp, where they die of the rot, and our &s;hips carried by hundreds into the enemy's ports, and
<PB N="56" REF="58">
will roundly a&s;&s;ert, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e facts are as notorious as his own political profligacy, that our victories are &s;plendid, our armies undimini&s;hed; and our trade protected and flouri&s;hing beyond all for|mer example! He makes my hair &s;tand on end to hear him! And when I look in his face, and &s;ee the broad familiar ea&s;y impudence with which he laughs at me and all of us, for our a&s;toni&s;hment, why, as I tell you, damn me if I am not dumb-founded! I am &s;truck all of a heap! I have not a word! I am choaked with rage, and amazement! Compared to him your brothel-keeper is a mode&s;t per&s;on! Were but our fortre&s;&s;es as impenetrable as his forehead, cur&s;e me if they would ever be taken. He is bomb-proof. The returns that lie on the table can make no impre&s;&s;ion upon him; and you may &s;ee him &s;n&egrave;er and laugh if they are pointed to in the cour&s;e of an argument.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, cou&s;in Evelyn, the nation
<PB N="57" REF="59">
is ruined. I &s;ee that clear enough. Our con&s;titution will &s;oon be changed to a pure de&s;poti&s;m. Barracks are building; &s;oldiers line our &s;treets; our commi&s;&s;ion of the peace is filled with the creatures of a corrupt admini&s;tration; con&s;tables are only called out to keep up the farce; and we are at pre&s;ent under little better than a military government."</P>
<P>Though Mr. Evelyn would have been better &s;atisfied, had Sir Barnard's &s;en&s;e of national grievances been equally &s;trong but le&s;s acrimonious, yet he was plea&s;ed to find that the&s;e grievances were now more than ever become a kind of com|mon-place bead roll of repetitions: of which their being &s;o familiarly run over by the Baronet was &s;ufficient proof: for a people that are continually talking of the evils that afflict them are not, as Sir Barnard and others have &s;uppo&s;ed, dead to the&s;e evils. The nation, that remarks,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
di&s;cu&s;&s;es, and complains of its wrongs, will finally have them redre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>SERIOUS DOUBTS ON SERIOUS SUBJECTS. PER|SONAL QUALMS, AND CONSIDERATIONS. AN INTERVIEW WITH SIR BARNARD. FEARS AND PRECAUTIONS, OR A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHAT farther pa&s;&s;ed in the conver|&s;ation I have recited was of little mo|ment: except that an appointment was made, on the following day, for me to be introduced to the Baronet.</P>
<P>Thus far &s;ucce&s;sful, Mr. Evelyn re|turned; and, as he was a man of a firm and ingenuous mind, he thought it ad|vi&s;eable to hold a con&s;ultation with me and my friends, on the pro&s;ecution of his plan.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">That per&s;onal con&s;iderations might in no degree influence the enquiry, he fir&s;t propo&s;ed the que&s;tion, without intimating to what it might lead, of&mdash;"how far it became a virtuous man to accept a &s;eat, on tho&s;e conditions under which a &s;eat only can be obtained, among the repre|&s;entatives of the people?"</P>
<P>Without wearying the reader with the arguments that were adduced, let it &s;uffice to inform him that we all agreed it was a very doubtful ca&s;e; that, in this as in numerous other in&s;tances, manners, cu&s;toms, and laws, obliged us to conform to many things which were odiou&s;ly vicious; and that to live in &s;ociety and rigidly ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules of ju&s;tice which would be&s;t promote the general happi|ne&s;s was, &s;peaking ab&s;olutely, a thing impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Whether the greate&s;t political cha|racters would be&s;t fulfil their duties by refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to the corrupt influ|ence
<PB N="60" REF="62">
of elections, to te&s;t-oaths, and to the mi&s;chiefs of mini&s;terial management within the walls, or whether they ought to comply with them, and exert their utmo&s;t faculties in pointing out the&s;e evils and endeavouring to have them redre&s;&s;ed, was a point on which we all &s;eemed to think the wi&s;e&s;t men might &s;u&s;pend their judgment.</P>
<P>In one thing we appeared to be en|tirely agreed: which was that &s;uch per|nicious practices were in all probability more frequently expo&s;ed, and brought into public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, through the me|dium of an a&s;&s;embly like this, than they would be did no &s;uch a&s;&s;embly exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither mu&s;t I detail what afterward pa&s;&s;ed, before I was brought to accept the propo&s;al of Mr. Evelyn. It would be tedious.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al did not confine it&s;elf to the &s;ingle act of giving me a &s;eat in parliament; and of furni&s;hing me with a
<PB N="61" REF="63">
qualification. It in&s;i&s;ted that the quali|fication &s;hould be a real and not a fic|titious deed.</P>
<P>To accept the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of three hundred a-year as a bounty, for which I could make no return, was I own hu|miliating to my pride. It made the que&s;tion continually recur&mdash;"Whether it did not give me the air of an impo&s;tor? A kind of &s;windler of &s;entiment? A pre|tender to &s;uperior virtue, for the purpo&s;e of gratifying vice?"</P>
<P>It &s;eemed at a blow to rob me of all independence; and leave me a manacled &s;lave to the opinions, not only of Mr. Evelyn, but, by a kind of con&s;ignment, of his relation the Baronet; and even to both their humours.</P>
<P>In fine, it was a mo&s;t painful &s;acrifice; and required all the amenity and active friend&s;hip of Mr. Evelyn to bring to my mind, not only my duties, but, the power that I &s;hould have at any time of
<PB N="62" REF="64">
re&s;igning my &s;eat, returning the deeds, and &s;heltering my&s;elf in my primitive poverty.</P>
<P>To this I added a condition, without which my refu&s;al would have been ab|&s;olute. It was that I &s;hould give a deed of mortgage, bearing intere&s;t, to the full value of the lands a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>I &s;hall forbear to dwell on &s;en&s;ations that were very active at the moment; which, on one hand, related to all that concerned Mr. Evelyn, my obligations, and &s;omething like dependence; and, on the other, to my &s;udden promi&s;ed elevation toward the &s;phere, in which my ambition was &s;o eagerly de&s;irous to move. Neither will I in&s;i&s;t on that which cau&s;ed my heart to beat yet more high, the ap|proach that I thus made to the lovely object of all my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Leaving this endle&s;s train of medi|tation, I proceed to relate events as they occurred.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">I attended Mr. Evelyn, according to appointment; and paid my re&s;pects to his cou&s;in, Sir Barnard. Having engaged my&s;elf thus far, I own I was &s;ufficiently piqued to de&s;ire to make a favourable impre&s;&s;ion: in which I was almo&s;t as &s;ucce&s;sful as I my&s;elf had hoped.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ight of me the Baronet was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and when we entered into conver&s;ation and he gave me an opportunity of uttering my &s;entiments concerning men and mea&s;ures, I painted &s;o forcibly that he was almo&s;t in raptures.</P>
<P>The only circum&s;tance in which I failed was my frequent interruption, and impatience, when he in turn began to declaim. I had the vice of orators: I heard no man's arguments, or language, that plea&s;ed me &s;o well as my own. I could not li&s;ten without an irritating anxiety, that was for ever prompting me to &s;upply a word, &s;ugge&s;t a thought, or detect a blunder. And, to a man who
<PB N="64" REF="66">
loves to make a &s;peech, it is intolerably mortifying to hear him&s;elf corrected, and cut &s;hort, in the middle of a &s;entence.</P>
<P>However I was &s;ufficiently guarded not to give any offence that was &s;trong enough to be remembered; and Sir Bar|nard was &s;o thoroughly engro&s;&s;ed, by the idea of the con&s;picuous figure which he and his new member &s;hould make in the hou&s;e, that he was ab&s;olutely impatient to &s;ecure me: being fully per&s;uaded that he had di&s;covered a trea&s;ure; of which now, at a general election, he was in con&s;iderable danger of being robbed.</P>
<P>The only precaution he took was to draw from me repeated a&s;&s;everations that I would not de&s;ert the cau&s;e of the peo|ple: by which, as I afterward found, he under&s;tood his own private opinions; and I that which he had literally expre&s;&s;ed. On this head he &s;eemed never &s;atisfied; and the terms in which he &s;poke, both of the member who had de&s;erted him and
<PB N="65" REF="67">
of all political tergiver&s;ation whatever, were the bittere&s;t that his memory could &s;upply.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A DINNER PARTY, AND FORTUNE IS GOOD HU|MOUR. THE OPERA HOUSE, AND SMALL TALK. SAGACIOUS FEMALE DISCOVERIES. OLIVIA, AND THE ART OF FASCINATING. AN OLD ACQUAINT|ANCE SUDDENLY SEEN AND DREADED, THOUGH DESPISED. TIMELY RECOLLECTION. THE OPERA GREAT ROOM, AND MORE DISCOVERIES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THESE points &s;ettled, the Baronet pro|po&s;ed to introduce me to his friends and connections, particularly of the political kind. For this purpo&s;e he began with inviting me and Mr. Evelyn to dine with him on the Friday following, when he was to have a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen, but chiefly of &s;uch as agreed with him on public affairs.</P>
<P>When the day came, I was pre&s;ented to
<PB N="66" REF="68">
the company by the Baronet with encomi|ums, and &s;eated on the left of Lady Bray.</P>
<P>A Scotch lord was on her right: it being her lady&s;hip's cu&s;tom to divide the ladies and gentlemen.</P>
<P>A young fellow properly introduced, if he be new in the circles of fa&s;hion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tolerable figure, is in no danger of being ill received. I had not indeed learned to be an adept at &s;mall talk: a qualification which, contemptible as it is, will &s;upply the want of every &s;uperior requi&s;ite, whether of mind or per&s;on: but I had an aptitude to oblige, be attentive, and &s;peak the moment I found I had any thing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I had laid no plan on this occa&s;ion: not having then read, or not remember|ing, I know not which, Lord Che&s;ter|field's &s;age reflections, on the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;tate&s;man's being well with the ladies. It happened however that, on this oc|ca&s;ion, I was received with di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="67" REF="69">
marks of approbation by the dear angels: from &s;everal of whom I received vi&s;iting-invitations.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic and the opera were among the topics on which they conver&s;ed. I was found to be an amateur; and Lady Bray was one of the dilettanti, had concerts at her own hou&s;e, and a box at the opera: to both of which &s;he &s;aid I &s;hould at all times have free admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was too plea&s;ing an offer to be refu&s;ed; and I willingly agreed to attend her lady&s;hip the following evening, and hear the charming mu&s;ic of <HI>I Zingari in Fiera</HI> by Pai&s;iello.</P>
<P>The opera &s;ea&s;on began rather early that year, many families were not yet come to town, we had little delay from the &s;tring of coaches, and, had her lady|&s;hip not provided again&s;t the misfortune by taking care to go more late than u&s;ual, we &s;hould have been &s;o unfa&s;hionable as
<PB N="68" REF="70">
to have heard the fir&s;t act. As it was, we arrived before it was over.</P>
<P>The thing on which her lady&s;hip be|&s;towed her immediate attention was to examine, by the aid of her opera-gla&s;s, which of the &s;ub&s;cribers were in their boxes; and how many of her particular friends were among them. Politene&s;s in|duced me to accompany her in this excur|&s;ion of the eye: for not to have li&s;tened to the names, titles, and ages, of her friends, with the births, deaths, marriages, creations, and pre&s;entations at court of them and their families, of which materials &s;mall talk is chiefly if not wholly com|po&s;ed, would have been the very highe&s;t defect in good breeding.</P>
<P>Why yes. Li&s;ten I did, as long as I was able: till my eyes, tongue, and fa|culties were all riveted to one &s;pot!</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip's box was near the cen|tre. She had carried my eye from box
<PB N="69" REF="71">
to box completely along one &s;ide, and had proceeded to about three of the op|po&s;ite, when &s;he directed her gla&s;s to one, with the owners of which &s;he had no acquaintance: but &s;he knew the names of all; for &s;he had them engraved on her fan.</P>
<P>That name was Mowbray! And the per&s;ons in it were Hector, his aunt, and Olivia!</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, gazing, entranced! Her lady&s;hip had talked I know not how long; and I had neither an&s;wered nor heard one word.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me," &s;aid &s;he, "Mr. Trevor! why you are <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> in a revery all of a &s;udden! That Mi&s;s Mowbray I find is a very dangerous young lady: for I am told that all the men are <HI>po&s;itively</HI> mad after her; and here are you <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s! What! Not a word yet?"</P>
<P>"I beg ten thou&s;and pardons."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">"Why this &s;eems like love at fir&s;t &s;ight! You are not acquainted, I &s;up|po&s;e, with the Mowbrays."</P>
<P>"Yes, my lady: from my infancy."</P>
<P>"Oh, oh! Why, then to be &s;ure you are intimate with this beauty; who <HI>ab&s;o|lutely</HI> eclip&s;es us all. I a&s;&s;ure you &s;he is <HI>po&s;itively</HI> the belle of the day. I hear &s;he has the very fir&s;t offers. But you are not &s;illy enough to act the dying &s;wain? What, no an&s;wer? Well, well: I &s;ee how it is! But, as we never read in any of the morning papers of gentle youths who break their hearts for love, in the pre&s;ent ungallant age, you are in no great danger. Though I think I never &s;aw any creature look more like what I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e one of your true lovers to be than you did ju&s;t now: for, be&s;ide your &s;peechle&s;s attitude, which was <HI>ab&s;o|lutely</HI> picture&s;que and &s;ignificant, you were <HI>po&s;itively</HI> pale and red, and red and pale, almo&s;t as fa&s;t as the ticking of my
<PB N="71" REF="73">
watch. And even yet you are <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> provoking. I cannot get a word from you!"</P>
<P>"Your lady&s;hip's raillery quite over|powers me."</P>
<P>"I declare I am <HI>po&s;itively</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed at what I have &s;een. Had a &s;tranger been all of a &s;udden &s;truck, the wonder would not have been <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> &s;o great: but it is <HI>po&s;itively</HI> unaccountable in you who are a familiar acquaintance of the fa|mily."</P>
<P>"I cannot boa&s;t of that honor."</P>
<P>"No, indeed! Why, do not you vi&s;it the Mowbrays?"</P>
<P>"I do not."</P>
<P>"What, you are a dangerous man; and are forbidden the hou&s;e? Well, I de|clare, I &s;hall <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> know your whole hi&s;tory in five minutes without your hav|ing <HI>po&s;itively</HI> told me a word."</P>
<P>"Your lady&s;hip has a lively imagina|tion."</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">I have heard that the aunt is a very cautious <HI>chaperon.</HI> But, I tell you what: I will be your friend. The Mowbrays are lately become intimate with two fa|milies where I vi&s;it. And I will <HI>ab&s;o|lutely</HI> take you with me, on one of their public nights. I will <HI>po&s;itively."</HI></P>
<P>This propo&s;ition was &s;o grateful, and my thanks were &s;o much more prompt than my recollection, that her lady&s;hip was quite confirmed in her &s;urmi&s;es; and not a little plea&s;ed with her own ta|lent at di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Her accu&s;ation however was very true. All &s;he could <HI>po&s;itively</HI> &s;ay could not <HI>ab|&s;olutely</HI> draw my attention from the box of Olivia, who&s;e turns and motions I was anxiou&s;ly watching; hoping that &s;ome lucky accident would guide her eye to|ward me.</P>
<P>Nay I partly hoped and partly feared the &s;ame of the aunt: my emotions being now influenced by the re&s;pectable &s;ta|tion
<PB N="73" REF="75">
which I at pre&s;ent &s;eemed to occupy; and now by the rememberance that even this might turn to my di&s;advantage, in the jealous apprehen&s;ions of the old lady.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ied as my thoughts were and ab|&s;orbed in anxious attention, this anxiety was &s;oon overcome by a much more pow|erful feeling.</P>
<P>A gentleman entered Olivia's box! My eyes were in&s;tantly turned on him. Recollection was rou&s;ed. My heart beat. It &s;urely was he! I could not be mi&s;|taken! My opera-gla&s;s was applied, and my fears confirmed. It was, indeed, the Earl of Idford!</P>
<P>Here then, in a moment, the enigma was &s;olved. The peer who had a&s;pired to the hand of Olivia, and who tempted her with all his opulence and all his dig|nity, could be no other than Lord Idford. He had long been intimate with Hector, and now comes without ceremony and
<PB N="74" REF="76">
joins the family. See how the aunt &s;miles on him! Nay, mark! Olivia is attentive to him! Her lips move! Her eyes are directed to his! She is conver&s;ing with him, and at her ea&s;e, while I am racked by all the terrors that jealou&s;y can rai&s;e! What, can &s;he not ca&s;t one look this way? Is &s;he fa&s;cinated by a reptile? Is there no in&s;tinctive &s;ympathy, that &s;hould make her tremble to betray the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of love in the very pre&s;ence of the lover! Does &s;he act complacency, and &s;it calm and unruffled! Has &s;he no foreboding that I will dart upon that in&s;ect; that thing; which, being le&s;s than man, pre|&s;umes becau&s;e it is called Lord! Thinks &s;he that I will not cru&s;h, tear, tread, him to du&s;t? He, the defrauder of my fair fame, who plundered me of the fir&s;t fruits of genius by infamous fal&s;ehood, who joined in plotting my de&s;truction by arts which the ba&s;e&s;t cowards blu&s;h at!

Is he the fiend that comes to &s;natch me from bli&s;s; and plunge me into pangs and horrors unutterable?</P>
<P>From the&s;e ravings of the mind I was a little recovered, by the very &s;erious alarm which the wild changes of my countenance produced in Lady Bray. I apologi&s;ed, pleaded indi&s;po&s;ition, but pre&s;ently was lo&s;t again in revery. For|tunately, a gentleman of her lady&s;hip's acquaintance came into the box, and left me to continue my embittered medita|tions.</P>
<P>Olivia was now attentive to the mu&s;ic; and the lord had only her aunt and Hec|tor, apparently, to be&s;tow his conver|&s;ation upon.</P>

my&s;elf with him, and entertain a doubt, concerning who ought to be pre|ferred.</P>
<P>But what rea&s;on had I to accu&s;e Oli|via? What did the&s;e angry emotions of my &s;oul forebode? Perhaps that my ha|bitual irritability, were &s;he mine, would make her mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>What was the end of exi&s;tence? Hap|pine&s;s. Had I not a right then to be happy? Yes. But &s;o had &s;he. So had her aunt. Nay &s;o had that rival, odious and de&s;picable as he was, who&s;e appear|ance had rai&s;ed this tempe&s;t in my &s;oul.</P>
<P>But was con&s;traint, was force, ju&s;tifiable in this aunt; or in this in&s;ignificant this &s;elfi&s;h lord?</P>
<P>Force it is &s;aid is the law of nature; and it is that law which impels the rave|nous tiger to &s;pring upon the lamb, and &s;uck its blood, to appea&s;e his craving ap|petite. But, if &s;o, if &s;elf-gratification were a defen&s;ible motive, the dete&s;table
<PB N="77" REF="81">
Norman robber, the mon&s;ter who inha|bited a cave and &s;eized on every &s;tray virgin, to deflower, murder her and prey on her remains, was ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>In the agitated mind, dreams like the&s;e are endle&s;s. While they were pa&s;&s;ing, I &s;tared with fixed attention toward Oli|via; and, had &s;he not been almo&s;t mo|tionle&s;s, my pa&s;&s;ive trances could not have continued.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dance was over, the &s;econd act had begun, more vi&s;itors came to pay their re&s;pects to Lady Bray, and I en|deavoured to recollect my&s;elf and &s;hake off a behaviour that might well be con|&s;trued inattention, if not ill manners; and might injure me even in that point on which I was then &s;o deeply intent. I ut|tered two or three &s;entences; and her lady&s;hip complimented me on being once more awake.</P>
<P>The per&s;evering attention of Olivia to the &s;cene, for it was impo&s;&s;ible to forbear
<PB N="78" REF="82">
glancing at her every moment, contri|buted to calm my fears.</P>
<P>It did more: it was a mo&s;t beneficial le&s;&s;on to me. It called me again to the con&s;ideration of that impetuo&s;ity of tem|per which was &s;o dangerous in me. Into what acts of frenzy and de&s;peration might not the&s;e fevers of the &s;oul hurry me? What in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance could I urge to ju&s;tify &s;uch exce&s;s? Had I not heard the reproaches of her aunt for her having refu&s;ed the hand of this Lord: if this Lord it &s;hould happen to be? When he entered the box, what had &s;he done, that &s;hould excite &s;uch frantic ec&s;tacies in me? What, except return tho&s;e civilities with|out which it is impo&s;&s;ible for man or wo|man to be amiable? Did &s;he now coquet, prattle, and di&s;play her power; tempted as &s;he was by &s;uch a public &s;cene of triumph? Was not her demeanour as cha&s;tely cautious as my own exigent heart could de&s;ire?</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="83">Every que&s;tion that the facts before me &s;ugge&s;ted was an aggravating reproof of my headlong pa&s;&s;ions; and, luckily for me, my thoughts took that train which was mo&s;t corrective and healthful. They led me too to dwell, with a melting and mild rapture, on the endearing virtues of Olivia: dignified, yet not au&s;tere; firm, yet not repul&s;ive; circum&s;pect, yet ca|pable of all tho&s;e flowing affections with|out which circum&s;pection is but mean|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e vi&s;ionary attributes: &s;uch as the di&s;ordered imagination of a lover fal&s;ely be&s;tows. They were as real as tho&s;e per&s;onal beauties by which they were embelli&s;hed.</P>
<P>To a&s;pire to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a woman &s;o gifted, and to be the lunatic which my own reproaches at this moment pictured me, was to demand that which I did not de&s;erve. To be worthy of her, it was fit I &s;hould re&s;emble her.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84">I endeavoured to obey the&s;e admoni|tions. I &s;chooled my&s;elf, concerning my remi&s;&s;ne&s;s to Lady Bray. I recovered my temper, became attentive, talked ra|ther plea&s;antly, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed my&s;elf in her good graces: in which I could perceive I had &s;omewhat declined, by the folly of my behaviour. To remind the reader on every occa&s;ion of the progre&s;s of intellect, and the benefits derived from experience, would be to weary his pa|tience, in&s;ult his under&s;tanding, and counteract my own intentions. It would &s;uppo&s;e in him a total ab&s;ence of ob&s;erva|tion, and rea&s;oning. Yet to be entirely &s;ilent might lead the young, and the in|attentive, to imagine I had in the be|ginning propo&s;ed a mode of in&s;truction which, as I proceeded, I had either for|gotten, abandoned, or had not the power to execute. If &s;uch will attend to the al|teration in my conduct, they will perceive that I, like every other human being, could

not but reflect more or le&s;s on the mo|tives that actuated me; and profit by the le&s;&s;ons I received: though rooted habits and violent pa&s;&s;ions were the mo&s;t diffi|cult to cure.</P>
<P>After the curtain dropped, I accompa|nied Lady Bray into the great room; and perceived among the throng, at &s;ome little di&s;tance, Olivia, and her aunt, at|tended by the peer.</P>
<P>I had fore&s;een the po&s;&s;ibility of this; and had rea&s;oned that there might be more danger in an abrupt rencontre, of this kind, than in meeting Olivia and her terrible aunt at the hou&s;e of Lady Bray's friend, as her lady&s;hip had promi&s;ed me; where I &s;hould receive her counte|nance, and that of the family to which I &s;hould be introduced. I therefore endea|voured to direct her lady&s;hip's attention from the place where the Mowbray party was, and &s;ucceeded in my endeavours.</P>
<P>Soon afterward, I &s;aw Hector, with

a knot of fa&s;hionable youths; among whom I was rather &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover my at that time unknown father-in-law, Belmont.</P>
<P>I had no inclination to be noticed by this groupe; and, as Lady Bray's car|riage was pre&s;ently afterward <HI>&s;topping the way,</HI> I had the good fortune to e&s;cape unperceived, or at lea&s;t unacco&s;ted, by both parties.</P>

<P>TO the friend&s;hip of Mr. Evelyn I had &s;o far &s;ubjected my&s;elf and the &s;pirit of independence which I was very properly ambitious to cheri&s;h as, for the pre&s;ent, to accept the aid he was &s;o de&s;irous to be&s;tow. I was &s;omething like compelled to be his debtor, but was unwilling, to be the debtor of any other man on earth; and, as he had enabled me to appear in the &s;tyle I have de&s;cribed, and furni&s;hed me with money, I was determined to &s;eek
<PB N="84" REF="88">
out Belmont, and di&s;charge the debt which his bounty had conferred; after he had previou&s;ly plundered me, at Bath. He had &s;unk in my e&s;teem: I now con&s;idered him as a profe&s;&s;ed gambler: but I remembered this action as that which it really was; an effort of bene|volence, to aid a human being in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus actuated, I went the next day to the billiard-table which he had been ac|cu&s;tomed to frequent; where I once more found him at play. He met me not only unaba&s;hed, but with &s;omething like cor|diality. He had &s;o accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to his own hypothe&s;is, that "&s;elf-grati|fication is the law of nature," and had &s;o confu&s;ed a &s;en&s;e of what true &s;elf-grati|fication is, with &s;uch an active faculty of perverting facts and exhibiting pictures of general turpitude, that he had very lit|tle &s;en&s;e of the vice of his own conduct; and was therefore very little &s;ubject to &s;elf-reproof. He behaved to me with the
<PB N="85" REF="89">
utmo&s;t ea&s;e and good humour; and, when his match was over, propo&s;ed that we &s;hould dine together at the Thatched-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>For a moment, I que&s;tioned the pro|priety of a&s;&s;enting: but, &s;eeing him now as before familiar with the officers of the guards, and people of who&s;e company no one was a&s;hamed, and recollecting where and how I had &s;een him the evening be|fore, I did not long he&s;itate. Be&s;ide which, I was prompted, not only by the plea&s;ure which his conver&s;ation gave, but by an increa&s;e of curio&s;ity to be better acquainted with who and what he really was.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were alone, I di&s;charged my con&s;cience by repaying him the twen|ty pounds. This gave occa&s;ion to the following dialogue.</P>
<P>"I perceive, Trevor, you are &s;till the fame. You pique your&s;elf on paying your borrowings. Had it been a debt of ho|nour
<PB N="86" REF="90">
indeed, I &s;hould not have been &s;ur|pri&s;ed: for tho&s;e are debts that mu&s;t be di&s;charged. Otherwi&s;e, it would intro|duce a very inconvenient practice in|deed."</P>
<P>"I believe, as you &s;ay, it would be in|convenient beyond de&s;cription to you&mdash; What do you call your&s;elves?&mdash;Oh! I recollect: '&s;porting gentlemen' is the phra&s;e. It would be inconvenient I &s;ay, to you &s;porting gentlemen."</P>
<P>"Whom, when we &s;porting gentle|men are ab&s;ent, you call blacklegs, rooks, Grecians, and other plea&s;ant epithets. Some &s;uch word, I could perceive, was quivering on your tongue. You remem|ber the plucking you had at Bath; and, though you are too much a&s;hamed of having been duped to mention it, yet it remains on your mind with a feeling of re&s;entment. That is natural: but it is fooli&s;h."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="91">"Is it fooli&s;h to have a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong?"</P>
<P>"Where is that &s;en&s;e to be found? Who has it? I have continually a &s;en&s;e, if &s;o you plea&s;e to call it, that there is &s;omething which I want; and by that I am impelled to act."</P>
<P>"True. But Locke, I think, tells us that crime con&s;i&s;ts in not taking &s;uf|ficient time to con&s;ider, before we act."</P>
<P>"And, begging his pardon, wi&s;e as in a certain &s;en&s;e I allow you this Locke was, in the in&s;tance you have cited, he was an a&s;s. If I do not mi&s;take, he has before proved to me that I cannot act without a motive; and then he bids me &s;top when I am in &s;uch a hurry that no motive occurs to my memory."</P>
<P>"According to this, an actual murder|er is not a more guilty man than he who only dreams that he commits murder?"</P>
<P>"Make what you will of the inference,
<PB N="88" REF="92">
but it is accurate. They are both dead a&s;leep, to any ideas except tho&s;e that hurry them forward."</P>
<P>"That is, in plain Engli&s;h, there is no &s;uch thing as vice."</P>
<P>"Might you not as well have &s;aid as virtue?"</P>
<P>"Speaking ab&s;olutely, I do not pre|tend to deny what you a&s;&s;ert. But you will not tell me that the man who robs me, and leaves me bound to a tree in danger of &s;tarving, has not done me an injury?"</P>
<P>"Will you be kind enough to &s;hew me who it is, among tho&s;e who have any thing to lo&s;e, that does not rob? Men who enjoy the plea&s;ures of life rob tho&s;e who are deprived of them of their due; and, according to my apprehen&s;ion, the latter have a right to make repri&s;als."</P>
<P>"Upon my &s;oul, Belmont, you have a mo&s;t inveterate habit of confounding every thing that &s;hould guide and regu|late
<PB N="89" REF="93">
mankind. You &s;hift the que&s;tion, confound terms, and are the mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate gladiator of vice I ever encountered, Your dangerous genius is a mine; where the ore is rich indeed, but the poi&s;on|ous vapour that envelopes it deadly."</P>
<P>"Each to his &s;y&s;tem. We have both the voyage of life to make. You place that very &s;ober and di&s;creet per&s;on called Hone&s;ty at the helm; by the &s;ingle di|rection of whom you expect to attain happine&s;s: which is ju&s;t as rational as to hope to circumnavigate the globe with one wind. I take a different cour&s;e: it is my maxim to &s;hift my &s;ails, and &s;teer as plea&s;ure and intere&s;t bid."</P>
<P>"Acting as you do, I cannot wonder that you &s;hould make a je&s;t of hone&s;ty."</P>
<P>"Upon my honour I treated Sir Ho|ne&s;ty with every po&s;&s;ible decorum, till I found that the in&s;idious ra&s;cal was making a je&s;t of me. Not that I am quite cer|tain I am not more truly the friend of
<PB N="90" REF="94">
this very re&s;pectable per&s;on than tho&s;e who pretend they are always in his com|pany; for I neither cant with Madam Morality nor pray with Dame Metho|di&s;m: though I cannot but think I am almo&s;t as religious, as moral, ay and as charitable too, as your devotees and &s;ab|bath-keepers; who go to church to pray and be &s;aved, and leave their &s;ervants to &s;tay at home, roa&s;t the meat and be damned."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t again repeat, you have the mo&s;t active fertility at embroiling all order and &s;y&s;tem I have any where met with."</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, ha! Order and &s;y&s;tem are very pretty words. But you make a &s;mall mi&s;take. It is not I that embroil. I find confu&s;ion already e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, &s;ince I cannot correct it, give me a rea|&s;on why I ought not to profit by the chao|tic hubbub?"</P>
<P>"But I &s;ay you can correct it. You
<PB N="91" REF="95">
are one of the men who might have been be&s;t fitted for the ta&s;k."</P>
<P>"I know not what I might have been: but I feel that I am not. The fir&s;t right of man, ay and, to talk in your own idiom, the fir&s;t moral duty too, is to be happy; and he is an idiot that, having a banquet &s;pread before him, forbears to ta&s;te be|cau&s;e he him&s;elf is not the purveyor. What matters it to me how it came there? Why am I to be excluded? Have I not as exqui&s;ite a reli&s;h as he that provided for the bill of fare?</P>
<P>"Let dull fools puzzle their brain concerning moral fitne&s;s, which they have not elevation enough of mind to under&s;tand; give me enjoyment.</P>
<P>"Let me eat the pine apple while they are di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the moral fitne&s;s of fea&s;ting on &s;uch luxuries."</P>
<P>"This doctrine would &s;ubject the world to your appetites and plea&s;ures."</P>
<P>"And is not that a noble doctrine?
<PB N="92" REF="96">
It is the wi&s;h and pa&s;&s;ion of the world to be gulled; and gulled let it be. Let it have its enjoyments; give me mine.</P>
<P>"One man is my banker, and is a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly careful to keep ca&s;h at my com|mand; which he transfers to me in the mo&s;t gentleman-like and honourable man|ner imaginable: namely, by a box and dice.</P>
<P>"Another is my &s;teward; and he lays out my grounds, &s;tocks my park with deer, builds me palaces, erects me hot-hou&s;es, and torments heaven and earth to furni&s;h my table with delicacies; for all of which I pay him in the current coin of flattery. It is true I permit him to call the&s;e things his own: but the real enjoyment of them is notoriou&s;ly mine. He, poor egoti&s;t, talks bomba&s;t and non|&s;en&s;e by whole&s;ale. I applaud and &s;mile at his folly; while he imagines it is at his wit. The poor man is amu&s;ed with fine &s;peeches, un&s;ub&s;tantial flatteries, cringes,
<PB N="93" REF="97">
bows, and hypocritical tokens of &s;ervility; which are &s;o many je&s;ts upon him.</P>
<P>"Thus is he mocked with the &s;hadow, while I banquet upon the &s;ub&s;tance. I ba&s;k in arbours and groves, without once having given my&s;elf a thought concern|ing planting or pruning. I fea&s;t on the fi&s;h, without &s;o much as the trouble of catching them; and &s;till le&s;s of con&s;truct|ing the pond. By the provi&s;ion he makes, that is, by avarice and extortion, he nurtures a brood of &s;ycophants and &s;laves. Wife, children, friends, &s;ervants, all have the &s;ame character; only differ|ently &s;haded: except that, if any of them can become his tyrants and tormentors, they all are ready for the ta&s;k. I have &s;tudied the noble arts both of tickling and tormenting: by which I have &s;ub|jected this very &s;elf-important race to my will and plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"For a man who&s;e acutene&s;s has carried him &s;o very far, I am amazed that it did
<PB N="94" REF="98">
not impel him to advance one &s;tep far|ther. Happine&s;s is what I and all men de&s;ire, as certainly as you do: but that happine&s;s is of a &s;trange kind, and held by a frail and feeble tenure, that is agitated by innumerable fears: that, if the means on which it depends be detected, is whol|ly de&s;troyed; and that, when lo&s;t, finds infamy and mi&s;ery its certain &s;ub&s;titutes.</P>
<P>"Mark what I &s;ay; and mark it deeply. There can be no happine&s;s without &s;e|curity; and there can be no &s;ecurity with|out &s;incerity. Therefore, hypocrites, of every cla&s;s, are acting contrary to their own intentions. They are providing mi&s;ery for them&s;elves, as well as for others: in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ures of which they are in &s;earch."</P>
<P>"Indeed? The Lord have mercy then upon all e&s;tabli&s;hments: legal, political, and eccle&s;ia&s;tic!"</P>
<P>"Let me farther ob&s;erve to you that the &s;y&s;tem of general enjoyment, which
<PB N="95" REF="99">
you propo&s;e, is &s;omething, if I may &s;o call it, more than rational: it is digni|fied; it is &s;ublime. I feel with you that he is a poor circum&s;cribed egoti&s;t, who can enjoy nothing but that which he calls his own. Let me ta&s;te every ble&s;&s;ing which the hand of nature pre&s;ents: let me banquet with you on her bounties: but let me not embitter the delicious re|pa&s;t by fraud, that en&s;laves me to an eternal watchfulne&s;s; depredation, that puts even my life in jeopardy; and a &s;y&s;tem founded in lies, and everla&s;tingly haunted by the &s;pectres of &s;elf-contempt."</P>
<P>Our dialogue was interrupted, by the entrance of the waiters.</P>
<P>When we had dined, Belmont began to enquire concerning my pro&s;pects and affairs.</P>
<P>"I expect," &s;aid he, "you will be le&s;s communicative and open hearted, now, than you formerly were. You have di&s;|covered, what I never attempted to con|ceal, that my pre&s;ent dependence is on

the exerci&s;e of talents which your gravity de&s;pi&s;es: e&s;pecially &s;ince they have laid you under contribution. This misfor|tune however, had you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, de&s;picable as they are, you would have e&s;caped."</P>
<P>"Yes: ju&s;t as the man, who hanged him&s;elf la&s;t night, e&s;caped a head-ach this morning. I will own to you I can|not take the plea&s;ure in your company, or think of you with that friend&s;hip, which I formerly felt: for, though I find your conver&s;ation no le&s;s animating, like &s;trong liquors, it leaves an unwhole&s;ome heat behind.</P>
<P>"However, I have no objection to in|form you that fortune has given me a momentary re&s;pite from per&s;ecution. How &s;oon &s;he may think proper to &s;tretch me on the rack again is more than I can fore&s;ee: though I greatly &s;u&s;|pect her of cruelty and caprice. She &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be in one of her be&s;t humours; and has given me a kind of

promi&s;e to make me one of the &s;age legi&s;|lators of this happy land."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?"</P>
<P>"That I &s;hall be a member of the new parliament."</P>
<P>Belmont bur&s;t into a violent fit of laughter. At fir&s;t, I was at a lo&s;s to con|jecture why; and e&s;pecially why it &s;hould be &s;o long, and &s;o unaffected: but I &s;oon learned it was a bur&s;t of triumph, which he could not re&s;train.</P>
<P>"I congratulate you, Mr. Trevor," &s;aid he, with a momentary gravity, "on your noble and moral pur&s;uits!&mdash;The lecture you have been reading, as well as tho&s;e I have formerly heard you read, now come upon me with invincible force! &mdash;There is no re&s;i&s;ting precept thus ex|emplified by practice!&mdash;How loud, how lofty, how &s;overeign, is the contempt in which you hold hypocri&s;y!&mdash;How &s;evere will the laws be that you will enact, again&s;t petty depredators!&mdash;I fore&s;ee you

Oh wi&s;e young judge, how do I honor thee!"</P>
<P>I remained &s;peechle&s;s, a few moments; and entirely di&s;concerted. I was irritated; though I knew not preci&s;ely at what. I attempted to an&s;wer; but was &s;o confu&s;ed that I talked ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, however, I recol|lected that my purpo&s;e in going into parliament was to counteract all the&s;e
<PB N="99" REF="105">
abu&s;es. I then recovered my faculties, and urged this plea very emphatically.</P>
<P>Still the moral dignity, and virtue, of the honourable hou&s;e I was about to enter, dwelt with &s;uch force on the ima|gination of Belmont that I could get no reply from him; except &s;arca&s;ms, &s;uch as tho&s;e I have repeated, with the &s;ame in|tervening fits of laughter as the images &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves to his mind.</P>
<P>And here, le&s;t the reader him&s;elf &s;hould be mi&s;led like Belmont, I mu&s;t remark that no mi&s;take is more common, and I believe none more pernicious, than that of imagining that, becau&s;e man has not attained ab&s;olute and perfect virtue, the very exi&s;tence of virtue is doubtful.</P>
<P>Hence it happens that he, who in any manner participates in the vices of a na|tion, or a body of men, is reproached as if loaded with the whole guilt.</P>
<P>Hence likewi&s;e, becau&s;e men without exception are more or le&s;s tainted with

<P>This is the doctrine at lea&s;t which the people who mo&s;t offend the&s;e principles are the mo&s;t zealous in propagating. Belmont had no refuge again&s;t &s;elf-reproach, but in cheri&s;hing &s;uch trains of thought.</P>
<P>That the vices which are the mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed in &s;ociety in&s;tead of being the mo&s;t de&s;picable are virtues, if compared to actions that find honor and reward, is a truth too glaring to be denied. That the cant with which the&s;e ma&s;ter crimes are glo&s;&s;ed over, and painted as ju&s;t, expedient, ay and heroic actions, that this diabolical cant &s;hould be and is adopted by men even of the highe&s;t powers, is a fact that a&s;toni&s;hes and con|founds. It impels us continually to a&s;k &mdash;Are they cowards? Are they hypo|crites? Or is the world inhabited by

none but lunatics?

<P>When we had taken as much wine as Belmont could prevail on me to drink, and he was very urgent, he a&s;ked if I played Piquet?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"You no doubt then play it well."</P>
<P>"I do not think it a game of much difficulty."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>BAD COMPANY PAINFUL, AS WELL AS DANGEROUS. A SHORT NOTE, EXCITING MUCH EXPECTATION. A QUESTION THAT SHOCKS AND SURPRISES. CLARKE AND OLIVIA, OR THE OVERFLOWING OF A FULL AND FRIENDLY HEART. VARIOUS MIS|TAKES RECTIFIED. THE READING OF THE LETTER AND THE EMOTIONS IT PRODUCES. RESOLUTIONS WORTHY OF VIRTUOUS LOVE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I LEFT the tavern in no very plea&s;ant temper of mind: impatient that I &s;hould be unable to convince, and reform, a man of &s;uch extraordinary acutene&s;s as Bel|mont: vexed that he, on the contrary, &s;hould per&s;uade him&s;elf that he was my

ma&s;ter; and &s;hould actually irritate me to a dangerous exce&s;s of vanity: and di&s;gu&s;ted that vice and virtue &s;hould be &s;o confu&s;ed, in the minds of men, as to render their boundaries almo&s;t undi&s;co|verable.</P>
<P>Such I mean was the impre&s;&s;ion that Belmont had left upon my mind, by re|peating the &s;tale but dangerous maxim that&mdash;men are vicious by nature; and, therefore, that to profit by their vices is no more than ju&s;t.</P>
<P>When I arrived at my lodgings, which were now in Albemarle-&s;treet, for I had changed them, I found the following note from Mi&s;s Wilmot.</P>
<P>"Come to me immediately. I have &s;omething to tell you which you little expect."</P>
<P>Belmont and my chagrin were for|gotten in an in&s;tant; and away I hurried, brim full of agitation, conjecture, and impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">I found Mi&s;s Wilmot alone; and her fir&s;t words were&mdash;"Oh, Mr. Trevor! you are a happy man!"</P>
<P>I &s;tood panting, or rather ga&s;ping, with hope; and made no reply. She thus continued.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Mowbray has been here."</P>
<P>"Good heavens!"</P>
<P>"She has acted like her&s;elf. I know not how I &s;hall tell you the &s;tory, &s;o as to do her ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"For the love of God, proceed!"</P>
<P>"As nearly as I can recollect her words, &s;he began in this manner."</P>
<P>'I cannot tell, my dear friend,' ad|dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, 'what you will think of my conduct. At one moment I &s;u&s;pect it to be wrong; and at the next blame my&s;elf for not having taken my pre&s;ent &s;tep &s;ooner. I have &s;urely been gro&s;sly mi&s;led. This indeed I have long &s;u&s;pected; and it cannot but be my duty to enquire. Have you lately &s;een Mr. Trevor?'</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="116">'I never fail to &s;ee him every day. I have a letter from him, for you; which he has di&s;dained to take any clande&s;|tine means of conveying to you. Here it is.'</P>
<P>'Before I dare think about his letter, an&s;wer me one que&s;tion. Is he a mur|derer?'</P>
<P>'A murderer! In the name of God! what can induce you to make &s;uch an enquiry?'</P>
<P>'I have been a&s;&s;ured that he has cau&s;ed the death of two men: one of whom he killed him&s;elf.'</P>
<P>'Where? When? How?'</P>
<P>'At Bath. By delivering one over to the fury of the mob; and by afterward provoking, in&s;ulting, and fighting with the other.'</P>
<P>'Heavens and earth! It is fal&s;e! wickedly fal&s;e!'</P>
<P>'Nay but do you know his &s;tory?'</P>
<P>'Perfectly. I have heard it, not only
<PB N="111" REF="117">
from him&s;elf, but, from the man whom I &s;uppo&s;e you have been told he has murdered.'</P>
<P>'What man?'</P>
<P>'Nay you &s;hall hear and &s;ee. You &s;hall have the whole hi&s;tory from the per&s;on's own mouth.'</P>
<P>'Is he alive? Is he in London?'</P>
<P>'I will &s;end for him. He will be here in a few minutes. You will then hear what this man has to &s;ay. He al|mo&s;t adores Mr. Trevor.'</P>
<P>"I immediately di&s;patched Mary for Mr. Clarke, who works not far off, as I &s;uppo&s;e you know, and who came run|ning the moment he heard that the lady you are in love with enquired for him.</P>
<P>"Mary informs me that his heart leaped to his eyes (it was her own phra&s;e) when he was told &s;he wanted to que&s;tion him concerning you; that he &s;prang up, clapped his hands, and exclaimed&mdash;'I

<P>"He entered the room breathle&s;s; and, the moment he &s;aw Mi&s;s Mowbray, he could not forbear to gaze at her: though ba&s;hfulne&s;s made him continually turn his eyes away.</P>
<P>"She addre&s;&s;ed him, with that mild|ne&s;s of manner which is &s;o winning in her, and &s;aid&mdash;'I have taken the liberty, &s;ir, to &s;end for you; to a&s;k a few que&s;tions.'</P>
<P>"He replied, with a bur&s;t of zeal&mdash; 'I am glad of it, madam! I am glad of it, from my heart and &s;oul!

God in heaven ble&s;s him! &s;ay I.'</P>
<P>"The enthu&s;ia&s;m of your generous humble friend overpowered Mi&s;s Mow|bray; &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and hid her face. Her pa&s;&s;ion was catching, and I followed her example. Clarke continued.</P>
<P>'On that night that he had the good hap to &s;ave your life, and the life of that old cankered lady, which as I find from all that pa&s;&s;ed &s;he mu&s;t be, though he talks of her too kindly by half, why the &s;topping of the frightened hor&s;es, ju&s;t do you &s;ee in the jaws of de&s;truction, and propping the coach was all his doing. He knew better what he was about than the coachman him&s;elf. And then, if
<PB N="114" REF="120">
you had &s;een him, as I did, after all was over! I thought I had loved my Sally dearly. And &s;o I do! But what am I? I thought too I dur&s;t have &s;tood up to the bolde&s;t man that ever &s;tood on &s;hoe leather! And perhaps I dur&s;t: but I find I am nothing in any ca&s;e to <HI>be.</HI> For which he never de&s;pi&s;es me: but in&s;i&s;ts upon it that I am as good a man as he, in any way.

<P>'I know it too,' &s;aid Mi&s;s Mowbray; &s;obbing. Then, with an effort to quell her pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he a&s;ked in a firmer tone: 'Pray, &s;ir, tell me: did not you work at Bath?'</P>
<P>'Yes, madam: the greate&s;t part of my life.'</P>
<P>'You appear to know of a battle, that Mr. Trevor fought?'</P>
<P>'Yes, yes, madam. I know it pretty
<PB N="115" REF="121">
well. I &s;hall remember it as long as I live, for more rea&s;ons than one.'</P>
<P>'Was there a man killed?'</P>
<P>'No, madam: God be prai&s;ed! I &s;hould have died in my &s;ins, unprepared and wicked as I was: being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ion. He, God ble&s;s him! for all he is a gentleman, begged my pardon like a man; and held out his hand, and prayed over and over that I would forget and forgive. But, as I tell you, I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I could be nothing el&s;e: be|cau&s;e, in the way of hard fighting, I de&s;pi&s;ed a gentleman. But he gave me to know better, as ob&s;tinate as I was: for, even after he had beaten me once, why, he begged and prayed, as he had done at fir&s;t, to make it all up. But, as I &s;aid before, the Evil One had taken hold of me; and I refu&s;ed to give in, till I was carried as dead as a &s;tock off of the place.'</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="122">'Then it was you that was reported to have been killed?'</P>
<P>'Why, yes, madam: becau&s;e it could be nobody el&s;e.'</P>
<P>'Nay, but was not there a poor man ducked to death?'</P>
<P>'No: God be thanked, once again! It was not quite &s;o bad as that. Though the hot-headed fools and rabble, that got hold of me, did u&s;e me ill enough, I mu&s;t &s;ay: for which I was &s;o angry with Mr. Trevor; and it was therefore that Old Nick put it into my head that I would beat him. For I cannot deny but the ducking did dwell upon my memory.'</P>
<P>'Were you then the &s;ame per&s;on that was &s;o ill treated at Lan&s;down races?'</P>
<P>'Yes, madam: for which, though I u&s;ed to be angry enough before time at pick-pockets, I will take &s;pecial care never to have a hand in ducking any body, as long as I live.'</P>
<P>'And is there no truth whatever in
<PB N="117" REF="123">
the &s;tory that two men were killed, by the ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion and malice of Mr. Trevor?'</P>
<P>'Killed by Mr. Trevor, madam! No, no! He is not that &s;ort of man. He would rather be killed him&s;elf than be the death of any chri&s;tian &s;oul: '&s;pecially if he was a poor body. I can &s;ay that for him. Why he fought like a mad man, to &s;ave me from the mob; when they were hu&s;tling me, and dragging me along. But, while one part of them gathered round him, the other had got far enough off with me. It being all a mi&s;take about a handkerchief: which he told them. And, though I heard him and &s;aw him beat about ju&s;t as if he had been a lion to &s;ave me, I could not forget how I had been u&s;ed, when I met him the next day. But I hope God will forgive me! which I do believe he will, for Mr. Trevor has &s;hewn him the ex|ample. I beg pardon! God forgive me!
<PB N="118" REF="124">
I only mean that, though Mr. Trevor is a good gentleman, the Lord of heaven mu&s;t be a better; and even more chari|table and melting in his heart. Which, to be &s;ure, is very &s;trange: becau&s;e I do not altogether under&s;tand how it can be.'</P>
<P>'Then it &s;eems your brother is &s;till living?'</P>
<P>'Brother, madam? I never had any brother! nor any thing of that kind: except my wife's &s;i&s;ters, <HI>which</HI> I love becau&s;e I love <HI>&s;he.</HI>'</P>
<P>'What &s;trange tales I have been told!'</P>
<P>'That I dare be &s;worn you have, ma|dam, from what I have heard. Becau&s;e there was the &s;ham-Abraham friends of Mr. Trevor: one of <HI>which</HI> kicked him, when he was down!'</P>
<P>'Is it po&s;&s;ible?'</P>
<P>'It is as true as God is in heaven, madam!'</P>
<P>'Do you know his name?'</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">'He was as tall as a Maypole. And then after he had done this cowardly trick, why he dur&s;t not &s;tand up to Mr. Trevor, like a man. And &s;o, madam, finding as you have been told a parcel of trumpery tales, I hope in God you will be kind enough not to believe one of them; now that you &s;ee they are all fal&s;e. For if there be a gentleman on the face of the earth that loves a lady to de&s;peration, why, Mr. Trevor is he; as you would have been &s;atisfied, if you had <HI>&s;et</HI> by his bed|&s;ide when as he was down in the fever; like as I and my Sally did; and had heard him rave of nobody but you. And then if you had &s;een him too the night after he took you out of the coach! and then went on to Houn&s;low. Which, as he &s;aid, &s;eeing it was parting with you, was wor&s;e than tearing his heart out of his body! But he was &s;o afraid of doing you harm! and of &s;etting that cro&s;s old lady to &s;cold you! For he would &s;uffer death rather
<PB N="120" REF="126">
than anger you. So that, while I have breath to draw, I &s;hall never forget, when we came to the inn, how he look|ed! and &s;tood quite lo&s;t and changing colour! and while his face was as &s;et as &s;tone, the tears kept trickling down his cheeks! At which I was put into a panic: for I did not at that time know what it was about, nor who we had been in com|pany with. Which was the more &s;ur|pri&s;ing, when I came to hear! For which, as he knows you to be &s;o good a lady, I am &s;ure you mu&s;t &s;ee all the&s;e particulars ju&s;t in the &s;ame light.'</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Mowbray had heard &s;ufficient. Her heart was bur&s;ting. It was with difficulty &s;he could check her feelings, and &s;he made no reply.

<P>"Good God! How pure, how ex|pre&s;&s;ive, how beaming, was the plea&s;ure in her eyes! though &s;he &s;obbed &s;o vio|lently that &s;he had lo&s;t all utterance.

another turn. She in&s;tantly recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech and exclaimed&mdash;'Oh, my friend!

<P>'For me he has ri&s;ked his life again and again, without he&s;itation: while I have &s;at in timid &s;ilence, and counte|nanced calumnies which it was impo&s;&s;ible I could believe; though I &s;eem as if I had endeavoured to believe them, from

<P>"She hurried it once over with great eagerne&s;s, and trepidation. She then pau&s;ed; debating whether &s;he &s;hould unburthen her mind immediately of a crowd of thoughts: but, finding they cro&s;&s;ed and di&s;turbed each other, &s;he be|gan again and read aloud; interrupting her&s;elf by remarks, as &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>'My reproof and anger'</HI>'&mdash;Yes, yes, I have taught him to treat me like a Sul|tana. He puni&s;hes me ju&s;tly without intending it.</P>

His &s;tory was that he &s;aw Mr. Trevor's di&s;traction, on the morning after he had lo&s;t his money at a gaming-table; to which ra&s;hne&s;s as it &s;hould &s;eem he was driven by de&s;pair; that Mr. Trevor ran into the fields, in a fit of frenzy, and threw him&s;elf into the Avon: that he, Philip, who had followed as fa&s;t as he could, ha&s;tened to the place but never &s;aw him more; and that con&s;equently and beyond all doubt he was there drowned.</P>
<P>'Philip, according to his own account, hurried into the water, and u&s;ed every means in his power to find the body: but, not being &s;ucce&s;sful, he returned to his ma&s;ter's lodgings, took &s;ome trifles that had been given him, and left Bath
<PB N="127" REF="133">
by the morning coach for London; hav|ing nobody in Bath to give him a cha|racter, and being le&s;s likely there to meet with another place.'</P>
<P>"I informed Mi&s;s Mowbray that this was part of it true, and part fal&s;e: for that Philip had taken a ten-pound note, which more than paid him his wages; and that the other things, which he car|ried away, had not been given him."</P>
<P>'Indeed!' exclaimed Mi&s;s Mowbray, 'I am exceedingly &s;orry to hear it: for, after his &s;econd ma&s;ter left Scarborough and he was hired by my aunt to wait on me, he behaved with great diligence and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>'Yet this accounts in part for his run|ning away: which he did that very night after I &s;uppo&s;e he had di&s;covered it was Mr. Trevor, at Cranford-bridge; and I have never &s;een or heard of him &s;ince.</P>
<P>'I am per&s;uaded he thought Mr. Trevor dead: for, after I had heard
<PB N="128" REF="134">
my brother's account of the battle, I thought the time and the circum&s;tances contradictory, and repeatedly que&s;tioned Philip; who per&s;i&s;ted in declaring he &s;aw Mr. Trevor jump into the river and drown him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Philip's account was that he had him|&s;elf been out on errands early in the morning, at which time he &s;uppo&s;ed the battle mu&s;t have been fought; and, though there were many contradictory circum|&s;tances, the po&s;itivene&s;s with which the two tales were told led me to believe that the chief incidents of both were true. And, as I &s;ay, the flight of Philip from Cranford-bridge per&s;uades me that he actually had believed Mr. Trevor dead.</P>
<P>'I am &s;orry the poor fellow has done this wrong thing, and been frightened away: for I never before heard a &s;ervant &s;peak with &s;o much warmth and affection of a ma&s;ter, as he did of Mr. Trevor.'</P>
<P>"She then continued to read; and
<PB N="129" REF="135">
made many ob&s;ervations, which expre&s;&s;ed di&s;&s;atisfaction with her&s;elf and were fa|vourable to you, till &s;he came to where you inform her that you had begun to &s;tudy the law."</P>
<P>'By this I find,' &s;aid &s;he, 'the &s;tory I have ju&s;t heard is fal&s;e.'</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked, What &s;tory is that, pray?"</P>
<P>"She replied, 'I was la&s;t night at the opera; where I &s;aw Mr. Trevor, with Lady Bray. Having &s;o lately met with him under circum&s;tances &s;o diffe|rent, and apparently di&s;advantageous, you may imagine that the joy I felt and the hope I conceived were not trifling.</P>
<P>'My aunt &s;aw him, likewi&s;e: but, as &s;he was not &s;o familiar with his per&s;on as to have no doubt, &s;he fir&s;t watched and then que&s;tioned me: though, as &s;he up|braidingly told me, &s;he needed only to have enquired of my looks.</P>
<P>'I ought perhaps fir&s;t to have informed you that I had thought it my duty to u&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="136">
the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, undeceive her, and declare all that I knew of what had pa&s;&s;ed at Cranford-bridge.</P>
<P>'I performed this ta&s;k on that very night, while her heart was alive to the danger &s;he had e&s;caped, and when &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a lively regret that the per|&s;on from whom &s;he had received &s;uch &s;ignal aid had di&s;appeared. Except his &s;ilence in the coach, &s;he &s;aid every thing be&s;poke him to be a gentleman: well bred, well educated, courageous, and as active as he was bold.</P>
<P>'When &s;he was told that the gentle|man, of whom &s;he had been &s;peaking with &s;o much warmth, had a peculiar motive for being &s;ilent, and that this gentleman was no other than Mr. Tre|vor, &s;he was very much moved. The recollection of the manner in which &s;he had been treating his character, and of the alacrity with which he had afterward &s;aved her life, was exceedingly &s;trong;
<PB N="131" REF="137">
and far from unmixed with pain. Before &s;he was aware of her&s;elf, &s;he exclaimed, This Mr. Trevor is a very extraordinary young man!</P>
<P>'Unfortunately for Mr. Trevor, our &s;er|vant, Philip, had ab&s;conded; and a train of &s;u&s;picions immediately aro&s;e in her mind. It might be a con&s;piracy among them; a de&s;perate and unprincipled contrivance, to effect a de&s;perate and unprincipled purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>'In this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;he confirmed her|&s;elf by every po&s;&s;ible &s;urmi&s;e: each and all re&s;ting upon the a&s;&s;umed league be|tween Philip and Mr. Trevor.</P>
<P>'I vainly urged that the &s;udden di&s;|appearing of both entirely contradicted &s;uch a conjecture; that Mr. Trevor, if he were capable of an action like this, mu&s;t be as wicked as he was mad; and that I had every rea&s;on to believe him a man of the mo&s;t generous and elevated principles. As you may &s;uppo&s;e, the&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="138">
arguments from me only &s;ubjected me to reproof, &s;arca&s;m, and even &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>'My aunt fortified her&s;elf in her opi|nion; and behaved with a more jealous watchfulne&s;s than ever. She even ter|rified me with the dread of that which I could not credit: the po&s;&s;ibility that what &s;he affirmed might be true.</P>
<P>'But, that I might do every thing in my power to prove that one part of her &s;urmi&s;es was fal&s;e, I determined cautiou&s;ly to avoid, for the pre&s;ent, &s;eeing or even hearing any thing concerning Mr. Trevor. And this was my inducement for writing the note, which you re|ceived.</P>
<P>'My mind however &s;uffered a con|tinual conflict. I debated on the pro|priety of li&s;tening to the daily defamation of Mr. Trevor, when there were &s;o many pre&s;umptive facts in his favour, and not endeavouring to prove that it was fal&s;e; and I accu&s;ed my conduct of apparent
<PB N="133" REF="139">
hypocri&s;y: of a&s;&s;uming a calm unconcern which my heart belied.</P>
<P>'The &s;ight of him at the Opera renew|ed my &s;elf-reproaches, in full force; and, likewi&s;e, fortunately awakened my aunt's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>'Accordingly, one of our morning vi&s;its, to-day, has been to a friend of Lady Bray's; and there we learned that Mr. Trevor had been introduced, by Sir Bar|nard, to his lady and their common friends; as a young gentleman coming into parliament, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of extraordinary talents.</P>
<P>'This I find by his letter is untrue; and there &s;till appears to be &s;ome my&s;tery which perhaps, as you &s;ee him &s;o often, you may be able to unravel.'</P>
<P>"I immediately reque&s;ted her to look at the date of the letter; by which &s;he &s;aw it had been written &s;everal weeks: and afterward made her acquainted with all the particulars I knew, concerning
<PB N="134" REF="140">
your beginning and renouncing the &s;tudy of the law, and your new political plans: mo&s;t carefully remembering to give your noble minded friend, Mr. Evelyn, his due &s;hare of what I had to relate.</P>
<P>"Oh! how did her eyes &s;wim, and her features glow, while I &s;tated what I had heard of his &s;entiments and proceedings! Yes! She has a heart! a heart to match your own, Mr. Trevor.</P>
<P>"She then read the remainder of the letter; but with numerous interruptions, all of them expre&s;&s;ing her admiration of your conduct by criminating her own.</P>
<P>"When &s;he had ended, &s;he &s;poke to me nearly as follows.</P>
<P>'I am now, my dear friend, determined on the conduct I mean to pur&s;ue. Oh! How it delights my heart that Mr. Tre|vor accords with me in opinion, and ad|vi&s;es me to that open &s;incerity after which I have long been &s;truggling, and which I am at length re&s;olved to adopt! I
<PB N="135" REF="141">
mean to inform my aunt of all that I know, as well as of all that I intend. I will tell her where I have been, &s;hew her this letter, repeat every thing I have heard, and add my fixed purpo&s;e not to admit the addre&s;&s;es of any man on earth; till my family &s;hall authori&s;e tho&s;e of Mr. Trevor. For that, or for the time when I &s;hall be unconditionally my own mi&s;|tre&s;s, however di&s;tant it may be, I will wait.</P>
<P>'Tell Mr. Trevor that my heart is overwhelmed by the &s;en&s;e it feels of his generous and noble conduct; that it ex|ults in his manly forbearance, which &s;o cautiou&s;ly guards my rectitude rather than his own gratification; that I will obey his injunction, and that we will have no clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence; but that our &s;ouls &s;hall commune: they &s;hall daily &s;ympathi&s;e, and mutually excite us to that per&s;everance in fidelity and virtue
<PB N="136" REF="142">
which will be their own reward, and the con&s;olation and joy of our lives.</P>
<P>'If my aunt, my brother, or any of their acquaintance, &s;hould again calum|niate Mr. Trevor, I will forewarn them of my further determination to inform him, and enquire into the facts. But I hope they will neither be &s;o unju&s;t nor &s;o ungenerous. At lea&s;t, I think my aunt will not; when &s;he hears the truth, knows my re&s;olution, and remembers Cranford-bridge.</P>
<P>'Of mi&s;interpretation from Mr. Tre|vor I am in no fear. Had he one &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, he never could have imagined the conduct he has &s;o nobly pur&s;ued. But to &s;uppo&s;e the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a thing in him would be a mo&s;t unpardonable inju&s;tice. The man who &s;hould teach me to di&s;tru&s;t him, as a lover, could never in&s;pire me with admiration and con|fidence, as a hu&s;band. But different
<PB N="137" REF="143">
indeed has been the le&s;&s;on I have learned from Mr. Trevor.</P>
<P>'Oh that Mr. Evelyn! What a god|like morality has he adopted! How rational! How full of benefit to others, and of happine&s;s to him&s;elf!</P>
<P>'But Mr. Trevor's friends are all of this uncommon &s;tamp; and I own that to look into futurity, and to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf excluded by prejudice and pride from the enjoyment of &s;uch &s;ociety, is perhaps the mo&s;t painful idea that can afflict the mind. I am almo&s;t afraid of owning even to you, my kind and &s;ympathi&s;ing friend, the torrent of emotions I feel at the thought of the pure plea&s;ures I hope for hereafter; from a life &s;pent with a partner like Mr. Trevor, heightened by the intercour&s;e of the generous, benevo|lent, and &s;trong-minded men who &s;hare his heart.'</P>
<P>To detail all that farther pa&s;&s;ed, be|tween Olivia and Mi&s;s Wilmot, with the
<PB N="138" REF="144">
particulars which the latter related to me, would but be to repeat &s;en&s;ations and in|cidents that are already familiar to the reader. And, with re&s;pect to my own feelings, tho&s;e he will doubtle&s;s have an|ticipated. What could they be but rap|ture? What could they in&s;pire but re|&s;olution: the power to endure, and the will to per&s;evere?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE STUDY OF ORATORY. REMARKS ON FASHION|ABLE MANNERS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. A PUBLIC DINNER. EMOTIONS AT THE MEETING OF QUONDAM ACQUAINTANCE. AMENITY WITH|OUT DOORS AND ANGER WITHIN COMPATIBLE. A DISCOVERY MADE BY THE BARONET. THE CONTENDING PASSIONS OF SURPRISE, RESENT|MENT, AND PITY. RAVAGES COMMITTED BY VICE. AN AWFUL SCENE, OR A WARNING TO GLUTTONY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PREVIOUS to this event, I &s;hould have imagined it impo&s;&s;ible to have increa&s;ed
<PB N="139" REF="145">
my affection: yet, if admiration be the ba&s;is of love, as I am per&s;uaded it is, my love was certainly increa&s;ed. I now &s;eemed to be &s;etting forward on a jour|ney, of the length of which I was indeed wholly ignorant; but the road was made plain, and the end was inexpre&s;&s;ible hap|pine&s;s. I &s;hould therefore travel with unwearied alacrity.</P>
<P>But, that I might &s;horten this un|mea&s;ured length of way, it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be as active in pur&s;uit as I was ardent in my pa&s;&s;ion: and the &s;timulus was a &s;trong one. Oratory accordingly, Olivia excepted, became the object that &s;eemed the deare&s;t to my heart. De|mo&s;thenes and Cicero were my great ma&s;ters. They and their modern com|petitors were my &s;tudy, day and night. No means were neglected that precept or example, as far as they came within my knowledge, could afford: and the additional intercour&s;e which I thus ac|quired
<PB N="140" REF="146">
with man, his motives, actions, and heart, was a &s;chool of the highe&s;t order.</P>
<P>I did not however entirely confine my&s;elf to the &s;ociety of the dead: the living likewi&s;e con&s;tituted a &s;eminary, in which I found frequent opportunities of gaining in&s;truction. Impelled by curi|o&s;ity and ambition, I was not remi&s;s in cultivating an acquaintance among tho&s;e people of fa&s;hion to whom I gained acce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, as the tribe that be&s;tow on them|&s;elves this titillating epithet have a light and ver&s;atile character, as they abound in prai&s;es that are void of di&s;crimination, and promi&s;es that are unmeaning, and affect at one moment the mo&s;t winning urbanity, and at the next the mo&s;t &s;uper|cilious arrogance, though they gave me much plea&s;ure, they likewi&s;e gave me ex|qui&s;ite pain.</P>
<P>The more I became acquainted with
<PB N="141" REF="147">
them, the more I was amazed, that the man who had been talking to me in the evening on terms of the utmo&s;t apparent equality, if I met him the next morn|ing, did not know me.</P>
<P>Some of them would even gaze full in my face, as if to enquire&mdash;"Who are you, &s;ir?" but in reality to in&s;ult me. The looks of the&s;e mo&s;t courteous and poli&s;hed people &s;eem to &s;ay "In the name of all that is high-bred, how does it happen that per&s;ons of fa&s;hion do not unite to &s;tare every &s;uch impertinent up&s;tart out of their company?"</P>
<P>Of all the in&s;olence that di&s;turbs &s;o|ciety, and puts it in a &s;tate of internal warfare, the in&s;olence of fa&s;hion wounds and imbitters the mo&s;t. It in&s;tantly pro|vokes the offended per&s;on to enquire&mdash; 'What kind of being is it, that takes upon him to brave, in&s;ult, and de&s;pi&s;e me? Has he more &s;trength, more activity, more under&s;tanding than my&s;elf?' In
<PB N="142" REF="148">
numerous in&s;tances, he is imbecile in body, more imbecile &s;till in mind, and contemptible in per&s;on. Nay he is often little better than a driveller.</P>
<P>He, whom the <HI>hauteur</HI> of fa&s;hion has compelled to rea&s;on thus, will &s;oon be led to further and more &s;erious inferences.</P>
<P>Nothing can reconcile men, &s;o as to induce them to remain peaceable &s;pec|tators of enjoyments beyond their attain|ment, except that unaffected benevolence which &s;hall continually actuate the heart to communicate all the happine&s;s it has the power to be&s;tow. This only can &s;o temper oppre&s;&s;ion as to render gradual and orderly reform practicable.</P>
<P>But I am talking to the winds.</P>
<P>This wavering between extreme civility and rudene&s;s was con&s;picuous in the beha|viour of the Bray family toward me. Her Lady&s;hip, at one moment, would overlook me, I being pre&s;ent, as if no &s;uch per&s;on had been in exi&s;tence: or as if he were
<PB N="143" REF="149">
not half &s;o worthy of attention as her lap-dog; for, as a proof, on the lap-dog it was lavi&s;hed: yet, at another, I was <HI>ab|&s;olutely</HI> the mo&s;t charming man on earth. I had <HI>po&s;itively</HI> the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te, good breeding, and all that that &s;he had ever known.</P>
<P>With Sir Barnard I was &s;ometimes an oracle. To me his di&s;cour&s;e was direct|ed, to my judgment his appeals were made, and my opinions were deci&s;ive. In other fits he would not conde&s;cend to notice me. If I interfered with a &s;en|tence, he would pur&s;ue the conver&s;ation as if an objection made by me were un|worthy of an an&s;wer; and perhaps, if I a&s;ked him a que&s;tion, he would affect to be deaf, and make no reply.</P>
<P>The&s;e are arts which render the con|dition of a &s;uppo&s;ed inferior truly hateful: and, as they were &s;everely felt, they were &s;everely remembered, and now and then
<PB N="144" REF="150">
retaliated in a &s;pirit which I cannot ap|plaud.</P>
<P>If the hi&s;tory of &s;uch emotions were traced through all their con&s;equences, and if men were aware how much the prin|cipal events of their lives are the re&s;ult of the petty ebullitions of pa&s;&s;ion, that branch of morals which &s;hould regulate the temper of mind, tone of voice, and expre&s;&s;ion of the countenance, would be|come a very &s;erious &s;tudy.</P>
<P>This remark is as old as Adam: and yet it relates to a &s;cience that is only in its infancy.</P>
<P>How fatal the want of &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary command of temper had been to me the reader already knows: and, though at moments I was painfully con&s;cious of the defect, and it was become le&s;s ob|tru&s;ive, it was far from cured. It &s;till hovered over and influenced my fate: as will be &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151">The old parliament was not yet di&s;|&s;olved: it had met, and was &s;itting. But the defection of Sir Barnard's member was of late date; and, as the Baronet had his motives for not wi&s;hing to provoke the honorable member whom he had made too violently, there was a kind of compromi&s;e; and the apo&s;tate was &s;uffer|ed to keep his &s;eat, during the &s;hort re|mainder of the term.</P>
<P>Sir Barnard however, as I have &s;aid, delighted in his prop. It was as nece&s;&s;ary to him as his cane; and I generally ac|companied him, when he vi&s;ited any kind of political a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>It happened that there was an annual dinner of the gentlemen who had been educated at *** ****; of which din|ner Sir Barnard was appointed one of the &s;tewards. That he might acquit him&s;elf of this arduous ta&s;k with eclat, I was of cour&s;e pre&s;ented with a ticket; and at|tended as his aid de camp.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">The company was numerous, and the &s;tewards and the chairman met &s;omething more early than the re&s;t, to regulate the important bu&s;ine&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>When I entered the committee room, with the Baronet, the fir&s;t per&s;on that caught my eye was the Earl of Idford.</P>
<P>I &s;hrunk back. I had a momentary he&s;itation whether I &s;hould in&s;ult him or in&s;tantly quit the company; and di&s;dain to enter an apartment polluted by his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I had however ju&s;t good &s;en&s;e enough to recollect that a quarrel, in &s;uch a place, nobody knew why, would be equally ri|diculous and ra&s;h: and that to avoid any man was cowardly.</P>
<P>The thought awakened me; and, collecting my&s;elf, I advanced with a firm and cool air.</P>
<P>Habit and perver&s;ity of &s;y&s;tem had done that for his lord&s;hip to which his fortitude was inadequate. He was at
<PB N="147" REF="153">
lea&s;t as cool, and as intrepid, as my&s;elf; and bowed to me with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and civility. To return his bow was infinitely more repul&s;ive than taking a toad in my hand: yet to forbear would have been a violation of the fir&s;t prin|ciples of the behaviour of a gentleman. I therefore reluctantly and formally com|plied. I hope the reader remembers how earne&s;tly I condemn this want of temper in my&s;elf.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip took not the lea&s;t notice of the coldne&s;s of my manner; but, with &s;impering complacency, "hoped I had been well, &s;ince he had had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me."</P>
<P>My reply was another &s;light inclina|tion of the head, tinctured with di&s;dain: on which his lord&s;hip turned his back, with a kind of open-mouthed noncha|lance that was truly epigrammatic; and fell into conver&s;ation with Sir Barnard, who had advanced toward the fire, with
<PB N="148" REF="154">
all the apparent ea&s;e of the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip: though, &s;ince his lord&s;hip had changed &s;ides, they had become, in politics at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t outrageous enemies.</P>
<P>This brought a train of reflections into my mind, on the behaviour of political parti&s;ans toward each other; and on the efforts they make, after they have been venting the mo&s;t cutting &s;arca&s;ms in their mutual parliamentary attacks, to behave out of doors as if they had totally forgotten what had pa&s;&s;ed within: or were incapable, if not of feeling, of re|membering in&s;ult.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t remarkable, the men of greate&s;t talent exert this amenity with the greate&s;t effect: for they utter and receive the mo&s;t biting reproaches, yet meet each other as if no &s;uch bickerings had ever pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is not then, in characters like the&s;e, hypocri&s;y?</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="155">No. It is an effort to live in harmony with mankind: yet to &s;peak the truth and tell them of their mi&s;takes un&s;par|ingly, and regardle&s;s of per&s;onal danger. In other words, it is an attempt to per|form the mo&s;t &s;acred of duties: but the manner of performing it effectually has hitherto been ill under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Sir Barnard had witne&s;&s;ed the &s;hort &s;cene between me and his lord&s;hip; and pre&s;ently took occa&s;ion to a&s;k me in a whi&s;per, "how and where we had become acquainted?"</P>
<P>I replied "I had re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of his lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Ay, indeed!" &s;aid the Baronet. In what capacity?"</P>
<P>My pride was piqued, and I an&s;wered, "As his companion; and, as I was taught to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf, his friend. But I was &s;oon cured of my mi&s;take."</P>
<P>"By what means?"</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">By his lord&s;hip's patrioti&s;m. By the purity of his politics."</P>
<P>I &s;poke with a &s;neer, and the Baronet bur&s;t into a malicious laugh of triumph: but, unwilling that the cau&s;e of it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, it was in&s;tantly re&s;trained.</P>
<P>"What concern had you," continued he, "in his lord&s;hip's politics?"</P>
<P>"I have rea&s;on to believe I helped to reconcile him to the Mini&s;ter."</P>
<P>"You, Mr. Trevor! How came you to do &s;o unprincipled, &s;o profligate, a thing?"</P>
<P>"It was wholly unintentional."</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand you."</P>
<P>"I wrote certain letters that were printed in the&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What, Mr. Trevor! were you the author of the three la&s;t letters of The|mi&s;tocles?"</P>

<P>The Baronet's face glowed with ex|ultation.

"I knew," &s;aid he with a vehe|ment but under voice, "he never wrote them him&s;elf! I have &s;aid it a thou&s;and times; and I am not ea&s;ily deceived. Every body &s;aid the &s;ame."</P>
<P>There is no calculating how much the knowlege of this circum&s;tance rai&s;ed me in Sir Barnard's opinion; and con&s;e|quently elevated him&s;elf, in the idea he conceived of his own power. "Had he indeed got hold of the author of The-mi&s;tocles? Why then he was a great man! A prodigious &s;enator! The wi&s;h of his heart was accompli&s;hed! He could now wreak vengeance where he mo&s;t wi&s;hed it to fall; and fall it &s;hould, with|out mercy or, remi&s;&s;ion." His little &s;oul was on tip-toe, and he overlooked the world.</P>
<P>Though we had retired to the farthe&s;t corner of the room, and his lord&s;hip pretended to be engaged in chit chat with per&s;ons who were proud of his
<PB N="152" REF="158">
conde&s;cen&s;ion, I could perceive his &s;u&s;|picions were awakened. His eye re|peatedly gave enquiring glances; and, while it endeavoured to counterfeit in|difference by a &s;tare, it was di&s;turbed and contracted by apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Malignity, hatred, and revenge, are clo&s;ely related; and of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions men of but little mental powers are very &s;u&s;ceptible. It is happy for &s;ociety that their impotence impedes the execution of their de&s;ires. I was odious in the &s;ight of Lord Idford in every point of view: for he had fir&s;t injured me; which, as has been often remarked, too frequently renders him who commits the injury implacable; and he had &s;ince en|countered a rival in me; which was an in&s;ult that his vanity and pride could ill indeed dige&s;t.</P>
<P>Still however he was a courtier; a man of fa&s;hion; a per&s;on of the be&s;t breeding; and therefore could &s;mile.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159">A &s;mile is a delightful thing, when it is the genuine offspring of the heart: but heaven defend me from the jaundiced eye, the &s;impering lip, and the wrinkled cheek; that turn &s;miles to grimace, and give the lie to open and undi&s;gui&s;ed plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was a &s;mile &s;uch as this that his lord&s;hip be&s;towed upon me, when I and the Baronet joined his group. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, with a &s;imper that antici|pated the pain he intended to give, he &s;aid&mdash;"Do you know, Mr. Trevor, that your friend the bi&s;hop of &mdash; is to dine with us? You will be glad to meet each other."</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly replied, with fire in my eyes, "I &s;hall be as glad to meet that mo&s;t pious and right reverend pa&s;tor as I was to meet your lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>Agreeably to rule, he bowed; and gave the company to under&s;tand he took this as a polite acknowledgment of re&s;pect. But his ge&s;ture was accompanied with a
<PB N="154" REF="160">
di&s;concerted leer of &s;mothered malice, which I could not mi&s;interpret. It was &s;ardonic; and, to me, who knew what was pa&s;&s;ing in his heart, di&s;gu&s;ting, and painful.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely &s;poken before my lord the bi&s;hop entered; and with him, as two &s;upporters&mdash;Heavens! Who?&mdash;The pre|&s;ident of the college where I had been educated; and the tutor, who&s;e veto had prevented me from taking my degrees!</P>
<P>In the life of every man of enterpri&s;e there are moments of extreme peril. In an in&s;tant, and as it were by enchant|ment, I &s;aw my&s;elf &s;urrounded by the cowardly, &s;ervile, dwarf-demons, for &s;o my imagination painted them, who had been my chief tormentors. Or rather by reptiles the mo&s;t envenomed; with which I was &s;hut up, as if I had been thrown into their den; and by which, if I did not exterminate them, I mu&s;t expect to be devoured.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="161">But the&s;e feelings were of &s;hort du|ration. My heart found an immediate repellent, both to fear and revenge, in my eyes. Good God! What were the figures now before me? Such as to ex|cite pity, in every bo&s;om that was not &s;hut to commi&s;eration for the vices into which mankind are mi&s;takenly hurried; and for their deplorable con&s;equences. What a fearful alteration had a few months produced! In the bi&s;hop e&s;pe|cially!</P>
<P>He had been &s;truck by the pal&s;y, and dragged one &s;ide along with extreme dif|ficulty. His bloated cheeks and body had fallen into deep pits; and the &s;welling ma&s;&s;y parts were of a black-red hue, &s;o that the &s;kin appeared a bag of morbid contents. His mouth was drawn awry, his &s;peech entirely inarticulate, his eye ob&s;cured by thick rheum, and his clothes were &s;tained by the &s;aliva that occa&s;ion|ally driveled from his lips. His legs were
<PB N="156" REF="162">
wa&s;ted, his brea&s;t was &s;unk, and his pro|tuberant paunch looked like the recep|tacle of drop&s;y, atrophy, catarrh, and every imaginable malady.</P>
<P>My heart &s;unk within me. Poor crea|ture! What would I have given to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of re&s;toring thee to &s;omething human! Re&s;entment to thee? Alas! Had I not felt compa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as never can be forgotten, I &s;urely &s;hould have de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;hould have almo&s;t hated, my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident was evidently travelling the &s;ame road. His legs, which had been extremely mu&s;cular, in&s;tead of being as round and &s;mooth in their &s;urface as they formerly were, each appeared to be co|vered with innumerable nodes; that formed irregular figures, and angles. What they were &s;wathed with I cannot imagine: but I conjecture there mu&s;t have been &s;tiff brown paper next to the &s;mooth &s;ilk &s;tocking, which produced the
<PB N="157" REF="163">
irregularities of the &s;urface. The dull|ne&s;s of his eyes, the &s;lowne&s;s of their motions, his drooping eyelids, his flaccid cheeks, his hanging chin, and the bag|ging of his cloaths, all denoted wa&s;te, want of animation, lethargy, debility and decline.</P>
<P>The condition of the tutor was no le&s;s pitiable. He was ga&s;ping with an a&s;thma; and was obliged ince&s;&s;antly to &s;truggle with &s;uffocation. It was what phy&s;icians call a confirmed ca&s;e: while he lived, he was doomed to live in pain. Where is the tyrant that can invent tortures, equal to tho&s;e which men invent for them|&s;elves?</P>
<P>The&s;e were the gue&s;ts who were come to fea&s;t: to indulge appetites they had never been able to &s;ubdue, though their appetites were vipers that were eating away their vitals.</P>
<P>How &s;trongly did this &s;cene bring to my recollection Pope on the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion!
<PB N="158" REF="164">
I could almo&s;t fancy I heard the poor bi&s;hop quoting
<Q><L>Mercy! cries Helluo, mercy on my &s;oul!</L>
<L>Is there no hope?&mdash;Alas!&mdash;Then bring the jowl.</L></Q></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent man is but the &s;lave of the pa&s;t. What induced the pre&s;ident and the tutor, when the bi&s;hop's more able-bodied footmen had rather carried than conducted him up &s;tairs, officially to be|come his &s;upporters as he entered the room? Was it unmixed humanity? Or was it tho&s;e &s;ervile habits to which their cunning had &s;ubjected them? and by which they &s;uppo&s;ed not only that pre|ferment but that happine&s;s was attain|able.</P>
<P>Humanity doubtle&s;s had its &s;hare; for it is a &s;en&s;ation that never utterly aban|dons the brea&s;t of man: and, as it is often &s;trengthened by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we our&s;elves are in need of aid, let
<PB N="159" REF="165">
us &s;uppo&s;e that the pre&s;ident and the tutor were become humane.</P>
<P>Though feelings of acrimony towards the&s;e per&s;ons were entirely deadened in me by the &s;pectacle I beheld, yet I knew not well how to behave. I was prompted to &s;hew them how placable I was be|come, by acco&s;ting them fir&s;t: but this might be mi&s;con&s;trued into that &s;ervility for which I had thought of them with &s;o much contempt. Be&s;ide, the bi&s;hop and the pre&s;ident, if not the tutor, were in the phra&s;eology of the world my &s;upe|riors; and etiquette had e&s;tabli&s;hed the rule that, if they thought proper to no|tice me, they would be the fir&s;t to &s;alute.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip however ea&s;ed me of far|ther trouble on this head, by a&s;king the bi&s;hop&mdash;"Have you forgotten your old acquaintance Mr. Trevor, my lord?."</P>
<P>What an&s;wer this con&s;ecrated right reverend father returned I could not hear. He muttered &s;omething: but the &s;ounds
<PB N="160" REF="166">
were as unintelligible as the features of his face; or the drooping deadne&s;s of his eyes. The pre&s;ident, however, hearing this, thought proper to bow: though very &s;lightly, till the earl added, with a &s;ig|nificant empha&s;is on the two la&s;t words &mdash;"Sir Barnard is become Mr. Trevor's particular friend;" which was no &s;ooner pronounced than the countenances of both the bi&s;hop's &s;upporters changed, to &s;omething which might be called exceed|ingly civil, in the tutor, and prodigi|ou&s;ly conde&s;cending, in the pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>This was a memorable day: and, if the event which I have now to relate &s;hould be offen&s;ive to the feelings of any man, or any cla&s;s of men, I can only &s;ay that I &s;hare the common fate of hi&s;|torians: who, though they &s;hould relate nothing but facts, never fail to excite di&s;plea&s;ure, if not re&s;entment and per&s;e|cution, in the parti&s;ans of this or that par|ticular opinion, faction, or e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167">The dinner was &s;erved. It was &s;ump|tuous: or rather &s;uch as gluttony de|lights in. The per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, were &s;everal of them glut|tons; and encouraged and countenanced each other in the vice to which they were addicted.</P>
<P>Di&s;h &s;ucceeded to di&s;h: and one plate|ful was but devoured that another and another might be gorged.</P>
<P>Fatal in&s;en&s;ibility to the warning voice of experience! Incomprehen&s;ible blind|ne&s;s!</P>
<P>The poor bi&s;hop was unable to re&s;i&s;t his de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>I had a foreboding of the mi&s;chief that might re&s;ult from a &s;tomach at once &s;o debilitated and &s;o overloaded. I wi&s;hed to have &s;poken: I was tempted to ex|claim&mdash;"Ra&s;h man, beware!" I could not keep my eyes away from him: till at length I &s;uddenly remarked a &s;trange ap|pearance, that came over his face; and,
<PB N="162" REF="168">
almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, he dropped from his chair in an apoplectic fit.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of his foaming mouth, di&s;torted features, dead eyes, the whites of which only were to be &s;een, his writh|ings, his&mdash;</P>
<P>No! I mu&s;t forbear. The picture I witne&s;&s;ed could give nothing but pain; mingled with di&s;gu&s;t, and horror. If I &s;ugge&s;t that poor oppre&s;&s;ed nature made the mo&s;t violent &s;truggles, to emp|ty and relieve her&s;elf, there will perhaps be more than &s;ufficient of the &s;cene of which I was a &s;pectator conjured up in the imagination.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop had been a mu&s;cular man, with a frame of uncommon &s;trength; and the paroxy&s;m, though extreme, did not end in death. Medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was obtained, and he was borne away as &s;oon as the cri&s;is was over: but the fe&s;ti|vity for which the company had met was di&s;turbed. Many of them were &s;truck
<PB N="163" REF="169">
with terror; dreading left they had only been pre&s;ent at horrors that, &s;oon or late, were to light upon them&s;elves. They departed appalled by the &s;cene they had witne&s;&s;ed, and haunted by images of a foreboding, black, and di&s;tracted kind.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Sir Barnard him&s;elf was not wholly free: though he had been le&s;s guilty of gormandizing than many of his a&s;&s;ociates: and, for my own part, this incident left an impre&s;&s;ion upon me which I am per&s;uaded will be &s;alutary through life.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HOW different is the &s;ame man, at dif|ferent periods of his exi&s;tence! How
<PB N="164" REF="170">
very unlike were the bowing well bred Earl of Idford, and the a&s;thmatic tutor, of this day, to the Lord Sad-dog and his Jack; whom, but a few years before, I fir&s;t met at college!</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident too at that time was, quite as much in form as in office, one of the pillars of the univer&s;ity. And the bi&s;hop! What a lamentable change had a &s;hort period produced!</P>
<P>Happy would it be for men did they recollect that change they mu&s;t; and that, if they will but be &s;ufficiently atten|tive to circum&s;tances, they may change for the better.</P>
<P>Time kept rolling on; and I had va|riety of occupation. Neither my &s;tudies, my fa&s;hionable acquaintances, nor tho&s;e whom I ju&s;tly loved as my friends, were neglected. Mr. Evelyn continued for &s;ome time in town; attending to his ana|tomical and chymical &s;tudies. Wilmot had completed his comedy. It had been
<PB N="165" REF="171">
favourably received by the manager; and was to be the &s;econd new piece brought forward. Turl, with equal per&s;everance, was pur&s;uing his own plans: and, though I heard nothing more from Olivia, my heart was at ea&s;e. I knew the motives on which &s;he acted; and had her a&s;&s;ur|ance that, if I &s;hould be again defamed, I &s;hould now be heard in my own de|fence.</P>
<P>I was careful not to forget hone&s;t Clarke; nor was the kind-hearted Mary neglected. The good carpenter had &s;ent for his wife and family up to town; and Mary was happy in the friendly attentions of Mi&s;s Wilmot, and in the orderly con|duct and quick improvement of her &s;on.</P>
<P>One of my plea&s;ures, and duties as I conceived it to be, was to introduce Turl and Wilmot to &s;uch of my higher order of acquaintance as might afford both parties gratification. There is much fri|volity among people of rank and fa&s;hion:
<PB N="166" REF="172" MS="y">
but there is likewi&s;e &s;ome enquiry and &s;ound under&s;tanding; and, where the&s;e qualities exi&s;t in any eminent degree, the friends I have named could not but be welcome.</P>
<P>It is the intere&s;t of men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> orders to conver&s;e with each other, to li&s;ten to their mutual preten&s;ions with patience, to be &s;low to condemn, and to be liberal in the con&s;truction of what they at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to be dangerous novelty.</P>
<P>Turl was peculiarly fitted to promote the&s;e principles: and Wilmot, in addi|tion to the charms of an imagination finely &s;tored, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as the reader may remember, of mu&s;ical talents; and tho&s;e of no inferior order. Days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed not unplea&s;antly away: for hope and Olivia were ever pre&s;ent to my imagination, and of the ills which for|tune had in re&s;erve I was little aware.</P>
<P>While bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure thus ap|peared to promote each other, it came to
<PB N="167" REF="173">
my knowledge that an adverti&s;ement had appeared in the papers: &s;tating that, if Hugh Trevor, the grand&s;on of the reve|rend **** rector of ***, were alive, by application at a place there named, he might hear of &s;omething very much to his advantage.</P>
<P>I cannot enumerate the conjectures that this intelligence immediately ex|cited; for they were endle&s;s. I &s;earched the papers, found the adverti&s;ement, and ha&s;tened to the place to which it directed me.</P>
<P>The information I there received was not preci&s;ely what my elevated hopes had taught me to expect: but it was of con|&s;iderable moment. I learned that my grandfather's executor, Mr. Thornby, was dead; that his nephew, Wakefield, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the property he had left; but that he had done this ille|gally: for the per&s;on who cau&s;ed the ad|verti&s;ement to be put into the paper was
<PB N="168" REF="174">
an attorney, who had drawn and witne&s;&s;ed the will of Thornby, which will was in my favour; and which moreover &s;tated that the property bequeathed to me was mine in right of a will of my grandfa|ther's; which will Thornby had till that time kept concealed. Whether the te&s;|tament he had produced, immediately after the death of the rector, were one that Thornby had forged, or one that my grandfather had actually made but had ordered his executor to de&s;troy, did not at pre&s;ent appear. The account I gave of it in a preceding volume, and of the manner in which it was procured, was the &s;ub&s;tance of what I learned from the conver&s;ation of my mother and Thornby at the time.</P>
<P>A death-bed compunction had wre&s;ted from the decea&s;ed an avowal of his guilt; and the facts were explicitly &s;tated, in the preamble of his will, in order to prevent the conte&s;t which he fore&s;aw might pro|bably
<PB N="169" REF="175">
take place, between me and his nephew. He &s;eemed to have been pain|fully anxious to do ju&s;tice at la&s;t; and &s;ave his &s;oul, when he found it mu&s;t take flight.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was urgent; and, if I meant to profit by that which was legally mine, it was nece&s;&s;ary, as I was advi&s;ed, immediately to go down and examine in|to all the circum&s;tances on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>I was the more &s;urpri&s;ed at what I had heard becau&s;e it was but very lately that I had &s;ent a remittance to my mother; which &s;he had acknowledged, and which mu&s;t have been received after her hu&s;|band had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his uncle's effects. But, when I recollected the cha|racter that had been given me of Wake|field, as far as the tran&s;action related to him, my &s;urpri&s;e was of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my mother, I heard with no &s;mall degree of a&s;toni&s;hment that &s;he had been applied to, in order to di&s;|cover
<PB N="170" REF="176">
where I might be found; and that &s;he had returned eva&s;ive an&s;wers: which as it was &s;uppo&s;ed had been dictated by her hu&s;band; under who&s;e control, part|ly from fear and partly from an old wo|man's doating, &s;he was completely held.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that I grieved at &s;uch weak|ne&s;s, in one whom I had &s;o earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to love and honor with more than filial affection, would be &s;uperfluous: but my &s;urpri&s;e would have in&s;tantly cea&s;ed, had I known who this Wakefield was; with whom my mother had to contend.</P>
<P>Reproach from me however, in word or look, had I been &s;o inclined, &s;he was de&s;tined never to receive. The career of pain and plea&s;ure with her was nearly over. On the &s;ame day that I made the enquiries I have been repeating, a letter arrived; written not by her, but at her reque&s;t; which informed me that, if I meant to &s;ee her alive, I mu&s;t u&s;e all po&s;|&s;ible &s;peed: for that &s;he had been &s;ud|denly
<PB N="171" REF="177">
&s;eized with dangerous and intole|rable pains; which according to the de|&s;cription given in the letter, were &s;uch as I found from enquiry belong to the iliac pa&s;&s;ion; and that &s;he was then lying at the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Two &s;uch imperious mandates, requir|ing, my pre&s;ence in my native county, were not to be di&s;obeyed; and I depart|ed with the utmo&s;t diligence. At the la&s;t &s;tage, after a journey of unremitted ex|pedition, I ordered the chai&s;e to drive to the hou&s;e of the late Thornby; where on enquiry I was informed that my mother lay.</P>
<P>I found her in a truly pitiable condi|tion. Quick&s;ilver had been admini&s;tered, but in vain; and &s;he was &s;o thoroughly exhau&s;ted that the &s;ight of me produced but very little emotion. Her medical at|tendant pronounced &s;he could not &s;ur|vive four-and-twenty hours; and advi&s;ed that, if there were any bu&s;ine&s;s to be &s;et|tled
<PB N="172" REF="178">
between us, it &s;hould be proceeded upon immediately.</P>
<P>Had this advice been given to per&s;ons of certain habits, a&s;&s;uredly, it would not have been neglected; and, perhaps it ought not to have been by me: but, whether I was right or wrong, I could not endure to perplex and di&s;turb the mind of a mo|ther in her la&s;t agonies. The con&s;e|quence was, &s;he expired without hearing a word from me, concerning her hu&s;|band, Thornby, or the property to which I was heir; and without making any mention whatever her&s;elf of the di&s;po&s;al of this property.</P>
<P>I was indeed ignorant of what degree of information &s;he could afford me. Her conduct had been &s;o weak that to re|mind her of it, at &s;uch a moment, would, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, have been to inflict a &s;e|vere degree of torment.</P>
<P>This, as the reader will learn in time, was not the only &s;haft by which my tran|quillity
<PB N="173" REF="179">
was to be a&s;&s;aulted. My mother though &s;he was, there was yet another death infinitely more heart-rending hang|ing over my head. The recollection is angui&s;h that cannot end! Cannot did I &s;ay? Ab&s;urd mortal. Live for the living; and grieve not for the dead: unle&s;s grief could bid them ri&s;e from their graves.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t proceed; and not &s;uffer my feelings thus to anticipate my tale.</P>
<P>Knowing that Wakefield was no other than Belmont, the reader will not be &s;urpri&s;ed that he &s;hould think proper to elude, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the di&s;covery which a meeting mu&s;t have produced. My mother, actuated by a conviction that death was inevitable, had &s;ent for me without his privity: &s;o that I afterward learned he was in the hou&s;e, when I drove up to the door: and, &s;eeing me put my head out of the chai&s;e, im|mediately made his e&s;cape through the garden.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">A man le&s;s fertile in expedients would have found it difficult to forge a plau&s;ible pretext, to evade being pre&s;ent and meet|ing me at the funeral: but he, by pur|&s;uing what wore the face of being, and what I believe actually was, very rational conduct, dexterou&s;ly &s;hunned the ren|contre.

But, as the ca&s;e was notori|ou&s;ly the rever&s;e, the hone&s;t contempt of all affectation, which it di&s;played, I could not but con&s;ider as an unexpected trait in the character of &s;uch a man as I &s;up|po&s;ed Wakefield to be.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange propen&s;ity in the imagination to make up ideal beings; and annex them to names that, when mentioned, have been u&s;ually followed with certain degrees of prai&s;e, or blame. The&s;e fanciful portraits are generally in the extreme: they are all virtue, or all vice: all perfection, or all deformity: though it is well known that no &s;uch un|mixed mortals exi&s;t.</P>
<P>My mind having acquired the habit rather to doubt than to conclude that every thing which is cu&s;tomary mu&s;t be
<PB N="177" REF="183">
right, funeral follies had not e&s;caped my cen&s;ure: but the thing which excited my &s;urpri&s;e was that a man like Wakefield, who I concluded mu&s;t have thought very little indeed, &s;ince he both thought and acted on other occa&s;ions &s;o differently from me, &s;hould in any in&s;tance rea&s;on like my&s;elf; and &s;ome few others, whom I mo&s;t admired.</P>
<P>Convinced however as I was that he now rea&s;oned rightly, I wanted in this ca&s;e the courage to act after his example. It would be a &s;candal to the country for a &s;on, pretending to filial duty, to be ab|&s;ent from his mother's funeral. The reader will doubtle&s;s remember that town and country are two exceedingly di&s;|tinct regions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE ALARMING INTELLIGENCE. AN HONEST YOUTH, WITH A PRINTER'S NOTIONS CONCERN|ING SECRECY. THE WEAK PARTS OF LAW FORM THE STRONGEST SHIELD FOR VILLANY. A JOURNEY BACK TO TOWN. ENOCH ELLIS AND GLIBLY AGAIN APPEAR ON THE SCENE OF AC|TION. A FEW OF THE ARTIFICES OF A MAN OF UNCOMMON CUNNING DELINEATED. A MOMEN|TARY GLANCE AT A MOUNTAIN OF POLITICAL RUBBISH. BY ARTFUL DEDUCTIONS, A MAN MAY BE MADE TO SAY ANY THING THAT AN ORATOR PLEASES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS &s;candal I was, notwith&s;tanding my di&s;cretion, de&s;tined to afford. In addition to the arguments of Wakefield, accident &s;upplied a motive too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>I have mentioned my intention to &s;up|pre&s;s the pamphlet which I had written, in the fever of my re&s;entment, again&s;t the Earl, the Bi&s;hop, and their a&s;&s;ociates.
<PB N="179" REF="185">
The edition which had been printed for publi&s;hing had lain in the printer's ware|hou&s;e, till the time that I had determined again&s;t its appearance.</P>
<P>The child of the fancy is often as dear to us as any of our children whatever; and I was unwilling that this offspring of mine &s;hould peri&s;h, beyond all power of revival. I therefore had the edition re|moved to my lodgings, and &s;towed in a garret.</P>
<P>A copy however had been purloined; and probably before the removal. This copy came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an un|principled book&s;eller; who, regardle&s;s of every con&s;ideration except profit, and per|ceiving it to be written with vehemence on a &s;ubject which never fails to attract the attention of the public, namely per|&s;onal defamation, had once more com|mitted it to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>As it happened, it was &s;ent to be re|printed by the per&s;on with whom the &s;on
<PB N="180" REF="186">
of Mary was bound apprentice; and the whole was worked off except the title-page, which fell into the hands of the youth.</P>
<P>De&s;irous of &s;hewing kindne&s;s to Mary, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed I had not over|looked her &s;on. His mother had taught him to con&s;ider me as the &s;aviour of both their lives; and as &s;uch he held me in great veneration. The&s;e favourable feel|ings were increa&s;ed by the prai&s;e I be|&s;towed on him, for his good conduct; and the encouragement I gave him to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Richard, for that was his name, &s;u&s;|pected it could be no intention of mine to publi&s;h the pamphlet: becau&s;e he had been employed to &s;tow it in the garret: and, as he was an intelligent lad, and ac|quainted with the tricks of the publi&s;her for whom he knew his ma&s;ter was at work, he ha&s;tened in great alarm to com|municate his fears; fir&s;t to his mother,
<PB N="181" REF="187">
and then by her advice to Mi&s;s Wil|mot.</P>
<P>The latter immediately informed her brother. He &s;aw the danger, wrote to me to return without delay, doubting whether even I &s;hould have the power to prevent the publication, and proceeded him&s;elf immediately to the printer to warn him of the nature of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>The man was no &s;ooner informed of Mr. Wilmot's bu&s;ine&s;s than he became violently enraged with his apprentice, Richard; accu&s;ed him of betraying his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, and the &s;ecrets of the printing-hou&s;e, which ought to be held &s;acred, and affirmed that he had endan|gered the lo&s;s of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Richard was pre&s;ent, was aware of the charge which would be brought again&s;t him, and was prepared to endure it with con&s;iderable firmne&s;s: though he had been taught to believe that &s;uch com|plaints were founded in ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188">Wilmot could obtain no unequivocal an&s;wer from the ma&s;ter: either that he would or would not proceed. He con|&s;equently &s;uppo&s;ed the affirmative was the mo&s;t probable; and therefore, that he might neglect nothing in an affair which he con&s;idered as &s;o &s;erious, he ha&s;|tened from the printer to the publi&s;her.</P>
<P>Here, in addition to the rage of what he likewi&s;e called having been betrayed, he met with open defiance, vulgar in|&s;olence, and vociferous a&s;&s;ertions, from this worthy book&s;eller, that the laws of his country would be his &s;hield.</P>
<P>The fellow had been frequently con|cerned in &s;uch ra&s;calities, and knew his ground. He was one of the &s;agacious per&s;ons who had found a cover for them. Where law pretends to regulate and de|fine every right, the wrong which it can|not reach it protects.</P>
<P>This is a branch of knowledge on which a va&s;t body of men in the king|dom,
<PB N="183" REF="189">
and e&s;pecially in the metropolis, depend for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. And a very tempting trade it is: for our &s;treets, our public places, and our courts of ju&s;tice, as well as other courts, &s;warm with its followers; at which places they appear in as high a &s;tyle of fa&s;hion, that is of effrontery, as even the fools by whom they are aped, or the lawyers and &s;tate&s;|men them&s;elves by whom they are de|fended. This I own is a bold a&s;&s;ertion; and is perhaps a hyperbole! Yes, yes: it is comparing mole hills to mountains. But let it pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Wilmot, in his letter to me, did not confine him&s;elf to a bare recital of facts. Fearful left they &s;hould e&s;cape my re|collection, he urged tho&s;e &s;trong argu|ments which were be&s;t calculated to &s;hew, not only what my enemies might allege, but what ju&s;t men might im|pute to me, &s;hould this intemperate pamphlet appear: which, in addition to
<PB N="184" REF="190">
its original mi&s;takes, would attack the character of the Bi&s;hop, a man who&s;e office, in the eye of the world, implied every virtue. And how immoderately would its intemperance and imputed malignity be exaggerated, &s;hould it ap|pear preci&s;ely at the moment when I knew di&s;ea&s;e had deprived him of his faculties! had rendered him unable to defend him&s;elf, and to produce facts which I might have concealed; or give another face to truth, which I might have di&s;coloured!</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments alarmed me in a very painful degree. I was aver&s;e to quit the place before my mother was interred: e&s;pecially as my rea&s;ons for &s;uch an ab|rupt departure could not be made public: but I was &s;till more aver&s;e to an action which, in appearance, would involve me in &s;uch a cowardly &s;pecies of infamy.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I made the be&s;t arrange|ments in my power: leaving orders that
<PB N="185" REF="191">
the funeral &s;hould be conducted with every decency; and, after a very &s;hort conver&s;ation with the attorney, who had witne&s;&s;ed the will of Thornby and given me the information I have already men|tioned, I travelled back to London with no le&s;s &s;peed than I had hurried into the country.</P>
<P>I arrived in town on Thur&s;day night; and the pamphlet was adverti&s;ed for publication on the following Monday. The adverti&s;ement, being purpo&s;ely writ|ten to excite curio&s;ity, repeated the &s;ub|ject of the pamphlet: which a&s;&s;erted my claims to the letters of Themi&s;tocles, and to the defence of the thirty-nine articles; the acrimony of which charge was in|crea&s;ed by a per&s;onal attack on the Earl of Idford, the Bi&s;hop, and their a&s;&s;o|ciates.</P>
<P>When I came to my lodgings, I found two notes: one from a per&s;on &s;tiling him&s;elf a gentleman employed by the
<PB N="186" REF="192">
Earl; and another from Mr. Ellis, on the part of the Bi&s;hop: each reque&s;ting an interview. An&s;wers not having been returned, the&s;e agents had come them|&s;elves; and, being informed that I was in the country, but was expected in town before the end of the week, they left a pre&s;&s;ing me&s;&s;age; de&s;iring an an&s;wer the moment of my arrival.</P>
<P>Eager as I was to ward off the danger that threatened me, I con&s;idered the ap|plication that was made, e&s;pecially on the part of the Earl, as fortunate. I un|der&s;tood that the only means of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the pamphlet would be by an injunction from the Lord Chancellor; and this I imagined the influence of the Earl might e&s;&s;entially promote: for which rea&s;on I immediately wrote, in reply to the&s;e agents, and appointed an interview early the next morning.</P>
<P>The place of meeting was a private room in a coffee-hou&s;e; and, though
<PB N="187" REF="193">
my eagerne&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s brought me there a few minutes before the time named, Ellis and his coadjutor had ar|rived before me. They acted in concert, and had met to compare notes.</P>
<P>I found the purveyor of pews and paradi&s;e &s;till the &s;ame: always inclined to make him&s;elf agreeable.</P>
<P>The other agent was &s;eated in a dark corner of the room, with his back to the light, &s;o that I did not recogni&s;e him as I entered. How much was I &s;urpri&s;ed when, as he turned to the window, I dis|covered him to be the loquacious Mr. Glibly; the man who&s;e principles were &s;o accommodating, who&s;e tongue was glo&s;&s;y, but who&s;e prai&s;e was much more &s;ickening and dangerous than his &s;atire.</P>
<P>The civilities that were poured upon me, by the&s;e well-paired gentlemen, were overwhelming. It was like taking leave of a Frenchman, under the ancient <HI>r&eacute;gime:</HI> there was no niche or chink for me to
<PB N="188" REF="194">
throw in a word; &s;o copious was the vo|lubility of Glibly, and &s;o eager was the zeal of Ellis.</P>
<P>From the picture I before gave of the fir&s;t, the reader will have perceived that he was a man of con&s;iderable intellect: though not of &s;ufficient to make him hone&s;t. His u&s;ual mode, in conver&s;a|tion, was to render the per&s;on to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ridiculous by ex|ce&s;&s;ive prai&s;e; and to mingle up &s;arca&s;m and panegyric in &s;uch a manner as to produce confu&s;ion in the mind of the object of it, who never knew when to be angry or when to be plea&s;ed, and laugh|ter in every body el&s;e.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the mo&s;t witty and acute would find amu&s;ement in his florid irony: but they could not but &s;oon be wearied, by its methodical and undeviating mechan|i&s;m; which denoted great barrenne&s;s of invention.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, he had a ca&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="195">
that required management: a patron to oblige, and an opponent to circumvent. He had therefore the art to a&s;&s;ume a tone as much dive&s;ted of &s;neering as habit would permit; and began by in&s;inuations that were too flattering to fail of their effect, yet not quite gro&s;s enough to offend. My per&s;on, my appearance, my parliamentary pro&s;pects, my under&s;tand|ing, my friends and connections, all pa&s;&s;ed in review: while his prai&s;e was carefully tempered; and as I imagined very pa&s;&s;ably appropriate.</P>
<P>Hence, it certainly promoted the end for which it was given: it opened my heart, and prepared me for that generous effu&s;ion which rather inclines to criminate it&s;elf than to in&s;i&s;t on every trifle that may be urged in its favour.</P>
<P>Apt however as he was at detecting vanity in others, he was as open to it him&s;elf, I might almo&s;t &s;ay, as any man on earth. He began with a profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="190" REF="196">
of his friend&s;hip for the Earl of Idford: in which he a&s;&s;umed the tone of having conferred a favour on that noble lord; and I will not deny that he was right. All his acquaintance were friends; and perhaps he had the longe&s;t li&s;t of any man in London: for the effrontery of his familiar claims upon every man he met, from whom he had any thing to hope or fear, was &s;o extraordinary as to render an e&s;cape from him impo&s;&s;ible. He had parroted the phra&s;eology of the <HI>haut ton,</HI> and its arrogant apathy, till the manner was &s;o habitual to him that he was uncon&s;cious of his own impudence.</P>
<P>Thus, in conver&s;ing on this occa&s;ion of the Earl who had deputed him, the only appellation he had for his patron was Idford. "I told Idford what I thought on the &s;ubject. For I always &s;peak the truth, and never deceive peo|ple: unle&s;s it be to give them plea&s;ure; and then you know they are the more
<PB N="191" REF="197">
obliged to me. Glibly, &s;aid Idford to me, I know you will act in this bu&s;ine&s;s without partiality. For I mu&s;t do him ju&s;tice, Trevor, and a&s;&s;ure you that Idford is a good fellow. I do not pretend that he is not &s;en&s;ible of the privileges which rank and fa&s;hion give him. He is vain, thinks him&s;elf a great orator, a fine writer, a wi&s;e &s;enator, and all that. I grant it. How &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? It is very natural. He would have been a devili&s;h &s;en&s;ible fellow, if he had not been a lord. But that is not to be helped. You and I, in his place, &s;hould think and act the &s;ame. We &s;hould be as much deceived, as &s;illy, and as ridicu|lous. It is all right. Things mu&s;t be &s;o. But Idford is a very good fellow. He is, upon my honor."</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon that has a difficult ca&s;e will not only make preparations and ad|ju&s;tments before he begins to probe, la|cerate, or cauterize, but will &s;ometimes
<PB N="192" REF="198">
admini&s;ter an opiate; to &s;tupefy that &s;en&s;ibility which he apprehends is too keen. Glibly pur&s;ued much the &s;ame method; and, having exhau&s;ted nearly all his art, till he found he had pro|duced as great a propen&s;ity to compli|ance and conciliation as be could rea&s;on|ably hope, he proceeded to the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"You no doubt gue&s;s, my dear Tre|vor, why my friend Ellis here and I de|&s;ired to meet you?"</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"To &s;ay the truth, knowing as I do the &s;oundne&s;s of your under&s;tanding, the quickne&s;s of your conception, and the con&s;equences that mu&s;t follow, which, acute as you are, you could not but fore|&s;ee, I was amazed when I read your ad|verti&s;ement!"</P>
<P>"It is prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpri&s;ing, indeed!" added Ellis: eager at every opportunity to throw in &s;uch touches as he thought
<PB N="193" REF="199">
would give effect to the colouring of his friend, and leader.</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid I, "do you call it my adverti&s;ement?"</P>
<P>"I mean of a pamphlet which it &s;eems has been written by you."</P>
<P>"But is going to be publi&s;hed with|out my con&s;ent"</P>
<P>"Are you &s;erious?" &s;aid Glibly: &s;taring!</P>
<P>"It is not my cu&s;tom to deceive peo|ple, Mr. Glibly; <HI>not even to give them plea&s;ure."</HI></P>
<P>"I am prodigious glad of that!" ex|claimed the holy Enoch. "Prodigious glad, indeed!"</P>
<P>"But you have owned it was written by you?" continued Glibly.</P>
<P>"I know no good that can re&s;ult from di&s;owning the truth; and e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance."</P>
<P>"My dear fellow, truth is a very pretty thing on &s;ome occa&s;ions: but to be con|tinually
<PB N="194" REF="200">
telling truth, as you call it, oh Lord! oh Lord! we &s;hould &s;et the whole world to cutting of throats!"</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure we &s;hould!" cried Ellis.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure we &s;hould! That is my morality exactly."</P>
<P>"Men are men, my dear fellow. A lord is a lord: a bi&s;hop is a bi&s;hop. Each in his &s;tation. Things could not go on if we did not make allowances. To tell truth would be to overturn all order."</P>
<P>"I am willing to make allowances: for all men are liable to be mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>"I approve that &s;entiment very much, Mr. Trevor," interrupted Enoch. "It is prodigious fine. It is my own. All men are liable to be mi&s;taken. I have &s;aid it a thou&s;and times. It is prodigious fine!"</P>
<P>"But I cannot conceive," added I, "that to overturn &s;y&s;tems which are founded in vice and folly would be to overturn all order. You may call &s;y&s;te|matic &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;y&s;tematic hypocri&s;y,
<PB N="195" REF="201">
and &s;y&s;tematic oppre&s;&s;ion order: but I a&s;&s;ert they are di&s;order."</P>
<P>"My dear fellow, nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as to a&s;&s;ert. But we will leave this to another time. I dare &s;ay that in the main there is no great difference between us. You wi&s;h for all the good things you can get; and &s;o do I. One of us may take a more round about way to ob|tain them than the other: but we both in|tend to travel to the &s;ame goal. I own, when I heard of your <HI>brouillerie</HI> with my friend Idford, I thought you had mi&s;&s;ed the road. But I find you have more wit than I &s;uppo&s;ed: you are now guided by another finger-po&s;t. Perhaps it might have been as well not to have changed. The trea&s;ury bench is a &s;trong hold, and never was &s;o well fortified. It is become impregnable. It includes the whole power of England, Scotland, and Ire|land; both the Indies; countle&s;s i&s;lands, and boundle&s;s continents: with all the
<PB N="196" REF="202">
grand out-works of lords, &s;piritual and temporal; governors; generals; admi|rals; cu&s;tos rotulorum, and magi&s;tracy; bodies corporate, and chartered compa|nies; exci&s;e, and taxation; board and bankruptcy commi&s;&s;ioners; contractors; agents; jobbers; money-lenders, and &s;pies; with all the gradations of the&s;e and many more di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es: under|&s;trappers innumerable; an endle&s;s &s;warm; a mon&s;trous ma&s;s. Can it be conjured away by angry breath? No, no. It is no hou&s;e of cards: for an individual to attempt to puff it down would be ridicu|lous in&s;anity."</P>
<P>A ma&s;s indeed! "Making O&s;&s;a like a wart." Yet the rubbi&s;h mu&s;t be re|moved; and it is mine and every man's duty to handle the &s;pade and be&s;om. But men want to work miracles; and, becau&s;e the mountain does not vani&s;h at a word, they ra&s;hly conclude it cannot be di|mini&s;hed. They are mi&s;taken. Political
<PB N="197" REF="203">
error is a pe&s;tilential cloud; den&s;e with mephitic and deadly vapours: but a wind has ari&s;en in the &s;outh, that will drive it over &s;tates, kingdoms, and em|pires; till at la&s;t it &s;hall be &s;wept from the face of the earth."</P>
<P>"My dear fellow, you have an admi|rable genius: but you have mi&s;taken its bent. Depend upon it, you are no po|litician: though you are a very great poet. Fine phra&s;es, grand metaphors, beautiful images, all very admirable! and you have them at command. You are born to be an ornament to your country. You have a very pretty turn. Very pretty indeed! And &s;o, which is the point that I was coming to, concerning this pam|phlet. It relates I think to certain let|ters that appeared, &s;igned Themi&s;to|cles."</P>
<P>"And to a defence, by my lord the bi&s;hop, of the thirty nine articles," added
<PB N="198" REF="204">
Ellis: "eager that he and his patron &s;hould not be omitted."</P>
<P>"You, my dear fellow, had &s;ome part in both of the&s;e publications."</P>
<P>"I do not know what you mean by &s;ome part. The &s;ub&s;tance of them both was my own."</P>
<P>"Ay, ay; you had a &s;hare: a con&s;i|derable &s;hare. You and Idford were friends. You conver&s;ed together, and communicated your thoughts to each other. Did not you?"</P>
<P>"I grant we did."</P>
<P>"I knew you would grant whatever was true. You are the advocate of truth; and I commend you. Idford mixed with political men, knew the temper of the times, was acquainted with various anecdotes, and gave you every informa|tion in his power. I know you are too candid to conceal or di&s;gui&s;e the lea&s;t fact. You would be as ready to con|demn
<PB N="199" REF="205">
your&s;elf as another. You have real dignity of mind. It gives you a cer|tain &s;uperiority; a kind of grandeur; of real grandeur. It is your principle."</P>
<P>"It ought to be."</P>
<P>"No doubt. And I am &s;ure you will own that I have &s;tated the ca&s;e fairly. I told you, Mr. Ellis, that I knew my friend Trevor. He has too much inte|grity to di&s;own any thing I have &s;aid. I dare believe, were he to read the letters of Themi&s;tocles over at this in&s;tant, he would find it difficult to affirm, of any one &s;entence, that the thought <HI>might not po&s;&s;ibly</HI> have been &s;ugge&s;ted in con|ver&s;ation by my friend Idford. I &s;ay <HI>might not po&s;&s;ibly:</HI> for you both perceive I am very de&s;irous on this occa&s;ion to be guarded."</P>
<P>"It certainly is a difficult thing," an|&s;wered I, "for any man po&s;itively to af|firm he can trace the origin of any one
<PB N="200" REF="206">
thought; and recollect the moment when it fir&s;t entered his mind."</P>
<P>My lips were opening to proceed: but Glibly with great eagerne&s;s prevented me.</P>
<P>"I knew, my dear fellow, that your candor was equal to your under&s;tand|ing. Mr. Ellis, who hears all that pa&s;&s;es, will do me the ju&s;tice to &s;ay that I de|clared before you came what turn the affair would take."</P>
<P>I was again going to &s;peak, but he was determined I &s;hould not, and pro|ceeded with his unconquerable volubi|lity; purpo&s;ely leading my mind to ano|ther train of thought.</P>
<P>"I am very glad indeed that the ad|verti&s;ement which appeared was not with your approbation. On recollection, I cannot conceive how I could for a mo|ment &s;uppo&s;e it was your own act. A man of the &s;ounde&s;t under&s;tanding may
<PB N="201" REF="207">
be &s;urpri&s;ed into pa&s;&s;ion, and may write in a pa&s;&s;ion: but he will think again and again, and will be careful not to publi&s;h in a pa&s;&s;ion. And the delay which has taken place might have proved to me that you had thought; and had deter|mined not to publi&s;h. Your counte|nance, when you di&s;owned the adver|ti&s;ement ju&s;t now, convinces me that I do you no more than ju&s;tice, by &s;uppo&s;ing this of you."</P>
<P>Here the artful orator thought proper to pau&s;e for a reply; and I an&s;wered, "I own that I wrote in a &s;pirit which I do not at pre&s;ent quite approve."</P>
<P>"I know it. What you have &s;aid and what you have allowed have &s;o much of liberality, cool recollection, and di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate hone&s;ty, that they are, as I knew they would be, very honorable to you."</P>
<P>"Prodigiou&s;ly, indeed!" &s;aid Enoch.</P>
<P>Glibly continued: "Your behaviour, in this bu&s;ine&s;s, entirely confirms my

good opinion of you; and I give my&s;elf &s;ome credit for under&s;tanding a man's true character: e&s;pecially the character of a man like you. My good friend Ellis and I are entirely &s;atisfied. What has pa&s;&s;ed has removed all doubts, and diffi|culties. We are with you; and &s;hall re|port every thing to your advantage."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h you to report nothing but the truth."</P>
<P>"I know it, my dear fellow. That is what we intend. So, without &s;aying a word more on that &s;ubject, we will now con&s;ider what is be&s;t to be done. I un|der&s;tand that the edition about to be pub|li&s;hed is pirated; and I &s;uppo&s;e you will join us in an application to the Lord Chancellor for an injunction."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t eagerly. That was my rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to &s;ee you, &s;o immediately after my arrival in town; imagining that an application from Lord Idford, and the bi&s;hop, would be more readily attended
<PB N="203" REF="209">to than if it came from a private and un|known individual."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure it would, Mr. Trevor!" &s;aid Enoch. "An application from an earl and a bi&s;hop, is not likely to be overlooked. They are privileged per|&s;ons. They are the higher powers. Every thing that concerns them mu&s;t be treat|ed with tenderne&s;s, and reverence, and humblene&s;s, and every thing of that kind."</P>
<P>The &s;pirit moved me to begin an en|quiry into privileges; and the tenderne&s;s and humility due to earls and bi&s;hops: particularly to &s;uch as the noble and re|verend lords in que&s;tion: but Glibly gue&s;&s;ed my thoughts, and took care to prevent me!</P>
<P>"As to tho&s;e &s;ubjects, my dear Ellis," &s;aid he, "Trevor thinks and acts on a different &s;y&s;tem from you and me and the re&s;t of the world. We mu&s;t not di&s;|pute the&s;e points, now; but away, as fa&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="210">
as we can, and put the bu&s;ine&s;s for which we met in a train. The publication mu&s;t be &s;topped. It would injure all parties; and, as you, my dear friend [Turning to me] ju&s;tly think at pre&s;ent, would be di&s;graceful to its author."</P>
<P>After what had been urged by Turl and Wilmot, and the rea&s;oning that had followed in my own mind, I knew not how to deny this a&s;&s;ertion: though it was painfully grating. But the reader will ea&s;ily perceive that this and other &s;trong affirmations, &s;uch as I have related, were de&s;ignedly made by Glibly. He art|fully gabbled on, that he might lead my mind from attending to them too &s;trictly; and that he might afterward, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require, &s;tate them, with the co|louring that he &s;hould give, as things ut|tered or allowed by me."</P>
<P>It ought not to be thought &s;trange that I was deceived by Glibly, barefaced as his cunning would have appeared to a man
<PB N="205" REF="211">
more ver&s;ed in the arts which over|reaching &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s daily puts in practice. He confe&s;&s;edly came in behalf of a party concerned; and, as &s;uch, a liberal mind would be prepared to expect a bias from him rather in favour of his client. His face was &s;miling; his tones were &s;oft and &s;mooth; the words candor, hone&s;ty, and integrity, were continually on his tongue. He affected to be a di&s;intere&s;ted arbi|trator; and allowed that his friend Idford, as he called him, might or rather mu&s;t be tainted with the vices of his &s;tation, and cla&s;s. Could a youth, unhacknied in the world, feeling that treachery was not native to the heart of man, not &s;u&s;pect|ing on ordinary occa&s;ions that it could exi&s;t, could &s;uch a tyro in hypocri&s;y be a fit antagoni&s;t for &s;uch an adept?</P>
<P>Deceit will frequently e&s;cape imme|diate detection: but it &s;eldom leaves the per&s;on, upon whom it is practi&s;ed, with that clearne&s;s of thought which commu|nicates calm to the mind; producing
<PB N="206" REF="212">
unruffled &s;atisfaction, and cheerful good temper.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A LAWYER AND HIS POETICAL WIFE AND DAUGH|TERS, OR THE FAMILY OF THE QUISQUES. PRAISE MAY GIVE PAIN. A BABBLER MAY BITE. MORE OF THE COLOURING OF CUNNING. A TRADER'S IDEAS OF HONESTY, AND THE SMALL SUM FOR WHICH IT MAY BE SOLD.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE quitted the coffee-hou&s;e; Glibly in high &s;pirits, and Enoch concluding things had been done as they &s;hould be: but, for my own part, I experienced a confu&s;ion of intellect that did not &s;uffer me to be &s;o much at my ea&s;e. I had an indi&s;tinct &s;en&s;e of being as pa&s;&s;ive as a blind man with his dog. In&s;tead of tak|ing the lead, as I was entitled to have done, I was led: hurried away, like a man down a mountain with a high wind at his back: or traver&s;ing dark alleys, holding by the coat-flap of a guide of
<PB N="207" REF="213">who&s;e good intentions I was very far from having any certainty.</P>
<P>We proceeded however to the hou&s;e of a &s;olicitor in chancery; who tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s for the Earl.</P>
<P>Here Glibly, attentive to the plan he had pur&s;ued, began by informing Mr. Qui&s;que, the lawyer, that he had come <HI>at the reque&s;t</HI> of his dear friend, Trevor, to entreat his aid in an affair of &s;ome moment. "Mr. Trevor is a young gen|tleman, my dear Qui&s;que, that you will be proud to be acquainted with; a man of talents; a poet; an orator; an author; a great genius; an excellent &s;cholar; a fine writer; turns a &s;entence or a rhyme with exqui&s;ite neatne&s;s; very prettily I a&s;&s;ure you. I mention the&s;e circum|&s;tances, my dear Qui&s;que, becau&s;e I know you have a ta&s;te for &s;uch things: and &s;o has Mrs. Qui&s;que, and the two Mi&s;s Qui&s;ques, and all the family. I now and then &s;ee very pretty things of their writing in the Lady's Magazine. An
<PB N="208" REF="214">
elegy on a robin red-brea&s;t. The droop|ing violet, a &s;onnet. And others equally ec&s;tatic. Quite charming! rapturous! elegant! flowery! &s;entimental! Some of them very &s;mart, and epigrammatic. It is a family, my dear Trevor, that you mu&s;t become intimate with. Your merit entitles you to the di&s;tinction. You will communicate your mutual productions. You will poli&s;h and &s;ugge&s;t charming little delicate emendations, to each other, before you favour the world with a &s;ight of them."</P>
<P>The broade&s;t and coar&s;e&s;t &s;atire was never half &s;o in&s;ulting, to the feelings, as the common-place prai&s;e of Glibly.</P>
<P>The barren-pated Ellis caught one of the favourite diminutives of Glibly; and fini&s;hed my panegyric by adding that, "he mu&s;t &s;ay, his friend, Mr. Trevor, was a prodigious pretty genius."</P>
<P>Who but mu&s;t have been proud of &s;uch an introduction to the family of the Qui&s;ques; by &s;uch orators, &s;uch eulogi&s;ts, and &s;uch friends?</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215">Acquainted with Glibly, and accu&s;|tomed to hear him prate, Mr. Qui&s;que &s;eemed to li&s;ten to him without &s;urpri&s;e, plea&s;ure, or pain. It was what he ex|pected. It was the man. A machine that had no more meaning than a Dutch clock; repeating cuckoo, as it &s;trikes.</P>
<P>Among Glibly's acquaintance, or, as he called them, his dear friends, this was a common but a very fal&s;e conclu&s;ion. He had not adopted his cu&s;tomary cant with|out a motive. The man, who can per|&s;uade others that he gabbles in a plea&s;ant but ridiculous and unde&s;igning manner, will lead them to &s;uppo&s;e that his actions are equally incongruous, and void of in|tention. He will pa&s;s upon the world for an agreeable harmle&s;s fellow, till his malignities are too numerous to e&s;cape notice; and then, where he was before welcomed with the hope of a laugh, he will continue to be admitted from the dread of a bite.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216">A lawyer however feels le&s;s of this panic than the re&s;t of mankind: becau&s;e he can bite again. The cat o' mountain will not attack the tiger.</P>
<P>Glibly returned to the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand; and again repeated that he was come <HI>at the reque&s;t</HI> of his dear friend, Trevor, to procure an injunction: that &s;hould prevent the publication of a pam|phlet, which had been written again&s;t his friend, Idford."</P>
<P>"And my lord the Bi&s;hop * * * *," added Enoch.</P>
<P>"Who is the author of it?" de|manded Qui&s;que.</P>
<P>"I am, &s;ir;" an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>"For which my friend Trevor is very &s;orry;" added Glibly.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly retorted a denial. "I never &s;aid any thing of the kind, Mr. Glibly. But I &s;hould be very &s;orry in|deed if it were publi&s;hed."</P>
<P>"Nay, my dear fellow, according to your own principles, if I do not mi&s;take
<PB N="211" REF="217">
them, that which ought not to be pub|li&s;hed ought not to be written."</P>
<P>The remark was acute: it puzzled me, and I was &s;ilent. He proceeded.</P>
<P>"It is a bu&s;ine&s;s that admits of no delay. I &s;hould be extremely chagrined, extremely, upon my honor, that my dear friend Trevor &s;hould commit him&s;elf to the public, in this affair. He that wan|tonly attacks the characters of others does but &s;trike at his own."</P>
<P>I again eagerly replied "The attack from me, &s;ir, was not wanton. It was provoked acts of the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice."</P>
<P>Glibly as eagerly interrupted me.</P>
<P>"My dear fellow, why, are you &s;o warm? I was only delivering a general maxim. I made no application of it; and I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould."</P>
<P>The traps of Glibly were numberle&s;s; and not to be e&s;caped. Words are too equivocal, and phra&s;es too indefinite, for men like him not to profit by their am|biguity. To them a quirk in the &s;en&s;e is
<PB N="212" REF="218">
as profitable as a pun or a quibble in the &s;ound. They &s;nap at them, as dogs do at flies. It is no le&s;s worthy of ob&s;ervation that, though &s;ome of his actions &s;eemed to laugh &s;everity of moral principle out of countenance, he continually repeated others which, had his conduct been regu|lated by them, would have ranked him among the mo&s;t worthy of mankind.</P>
<P>After farther explanation from Qui&s;que, it was admitted that the intere&s;t of all parties made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to act with great diligence, &s;peed, and caution.</P>
<P>Through the whole of this &s;cene, Glibly was con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf; in giving it &s;uch a turn and complexion as to make it requi&s;ite, for the pre&s;ervation of my cha|racter above the re&s;t, to prevent the pam|phlet from being publi&s;hed. If, when|ever I detected his drift, I urged the true motives by which I was actuated, he al|ways immediately admitted them, prai&s;ed them, and allowed them to be &s;uperla|tively excellent: but never failed to give
<PB N="213" REF="219">
them &s;uch an air as &s;hould &s;uit the project he had conceived; and allow of &s;uch an interpretation, in future, as would excul|pate my opponents and criminate my&s;elf. But he effected this with &s;uch fluency, and &s;o glo&s;&s;ed over and coloured his in|tention that, like profound darkne&s;s, it was every where pre&s;ent, but neither could be felt nor &s;een.</P>
<P>My own activity in this affair, which if I meant to render my interference effec|tual was inevitable, contributed to the &s;ame end. I accompanied the whole party, Qui&s;que being one, to the &s;hop of the publi&s;her.</P>
<P>Here I detailed the con&s;equences, as well to my&s;elf as to the Earl and the Bi&s;hop; and vehemently denounced threats, if the villany that was begun &s;hould be carried into execution. Not all the quieting hints of my a&s;&s;i&s;tants could keep my anger under. I lo&s;t all patience, at every word. My utmo&s;t indignation was excited by &s;o black a bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="220">The &s;ituation was not a new one to the dealer in the alphabet. He was an old depredator; and had before encountered angry authors, and artful lawyers. He was cool, collected, and unaba&s;hed. Not indeed entirely: but &s;ufficiently &s;o to ex|cite a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>He affirmed the copy-right to be his own: would prove he had obtained it legally; and would face any pro&s;ecution that we could bring. He knew what he was about; and was not be frightened. He had printed one edition; and had no doubt that &s;everal would be &s;old. He was an hone&s;t trade&s;man; and mu&s;t not be robbed of his profits. What would the country be if it were not for trade? It ought to be protected: ay and would be too. The law was as open to an indu&s;tri|ous fair trader as to any lord in the land. Let him too be no lo&s;er and then it would be a different thing: but, as for big words, they broke no bones; and he knew his ground.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="221">The hints of the hone&s;t trader were too broad to be mi&s;under&s;tood; and Qui&s;que replied&mdash;"I think you mean, &s;ir, that you wi&s;h to be repaid the expence you have &s;u&s;tained?"</P>
<P>The fellow an&s;wered, with the utmo&s;t effrontery, "I have a right, &s;ir, to be in|demnified for the lo&s;s of my profits on the &s;ale of the work."</P>
<P>Anger and argument were equally vain. There were two ways of proceeding. Si|lence and &s;afety might be purcha&s;ed: or the law might be let loo&s;e on a knave, who &s;et it at defiance. The one was &s;e|cure: the other problematical; and replete with the danger which we wi&s;hed to avert.</P>
<P>Qui&s;que a&s;ked him what was the &s;um that he demanded? His reply was more moderate than from appearances we had rea&s;on to expect: it was one hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Glibly de&s;ired he would permit us to con&s;ult five minutes among our&s;elves. He withdrew; and the fluent agent re|marked

<PB N="216" REF="224">
the &s;um was a trifle: but, trifling as it was, he had no doubt but feelings of delicacy and honor would dictate that it ought to be jointly paid, by the three parties principally concerned.</P>
<P>He had urged a motive which I knew not how to re&s;i&s;t, and I gave my a&s;&s;ent. By this manoeuvre he gained the point which he intended. He implicated me, as paying to &s;uppre&s;s a pamphlet which, according to his interpretation, I at pre|&s;ent allowed to be defamatory, and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The money however was paid, and the copies of the pamphlet were delivered: and, being determined if po&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;uch another accident, tho&s;e that I had cau&s;ed to be printed were di&s;lodged from their garret; both editions, a &s;ingle copy of each excepted, were taken into the fields by night, and burned; and thus expired a production which had aided to drain my pocket, wa&s;te my time, and inflame my pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
