<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD VISCOUNT CHARLEMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is generally expected that there &s;hould be &s;ome rela|tion between the character of the patron and the nature of the work, for which protection is &s;olicited.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">BUT this law, like many others, is broken when it op|po&s;es the gratification of pa&s;|&s;ions too &s;trong for the re|&s;traints of regularity. Ambi|tion, which often overpowers the judgment in que&s;tions of more importance, has made me forget the di&s;proportion be|tween Your Lord&s;hip's name, and a Dramatic Pa&s;toral; and I have ventured to lay before You a compo&s;ition of little dignity in the de&s;ign, and per|haps of little elegance in the execution.</P>
<P>YET for whatever we re|&s;olve, we labour to find rea&s;ons,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
till in time we forget its impro|priety; I begin to hope, that by offering to Your Lord&s;hip a performance of an airy and luxuriant kind, which can at be&s;t hope only for excu&s;e, I expo&s;e my&s;elf le&s;s to the im|putation of arrogance, than if I had prefixed Your name to a piece more grave and oftenta|tious, which might have been &s;u&s;pected of pretending to ap|probation.</P>
<P>I am, my Lord, far from imagining that any of my ideas can be new to Your exten&s;ive knowledge, or that I have at|tained any beauties of &s;tyle or
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
&s;entiment adequate to Your delicacy of ta&s;te. The merit of this Poem is but &s;mall in my own opinion, and yet, of the lit|tle prai&s;e which it may receive, I mu&s;t re&s;ign a part, by confe&s;|&s;ing that the fir&s;t hint was taken from the PASTOR FIDO, and that the two &s;ongs marked with a&s;teri&s;ks <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 11, and 24.</NOTE>, were written by another hand.</P>
<P>WHATEVER prai&s;e this con|fe&s;&s;ion may detract from my abilities, it will add to my &s;in|cerity; and I &s;hould di&s;cover little knowledge of Your Lord|&s;hip, if I &s;hould endeavour to
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
recommend my&s;elf, rather by elevation of genius than by pu|rity of manners.</P>
