<P>A Clear Wit, &s;ound Judg|ment, and a Merciful Di&s;po|&s;ition, are things &s;o rarely united, that it is almo&s;t inexcu&s;a|ble to entertain them with any

thing le&s;s excellent in its kind. My knowledge of you were a &s;ufficient Caution to me, to a|void your Cen&s;ure of this Trifle, had I not as intire a knowledge of your Goodne&s;s. Since I have drawn my Pen for a Rencoun|ter, I think it better to engage where, though there be Skill e|nough to Di&s;arm me, there is too much Genero&s;ity to Wound; for &s;o &s;hall I have the &s;aving Re|putation of an un&s;ucce&s;sful Cou|rage, if I cannot make it a drawn Battle. But methinks the Com|pari&s;on intimates &s;omething of a Defiance, and &s;avours of Arrogance;

wherefore &s;ince I am Con|&s;cious to my &s;elf of a Fear which I cannot put off, let me u&s;e the Policy of Cowards and lay this Novel unarm'd, naked and &s;hi|vering at your Feet, &s;o that if it &s;hould want Merit to challenge Protection, yet, as an Object of Charity, it may move Com|pa&s;&s;ion. It has been &s;ome Diver|&s;ion to me to Write it, I wi&s;h it may prove &s;uch to you when you have an hour to throw away in Reading of it: but this Satis|faction I have at lea&s;t beforehand, that in its greate&s;t failings it may fly for Pardon to that Indulgence

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME Authors are &s;o fond of a Pre|face, that they will write one though there be nothing more in it than an Apology for its &s;elf. But to &s;how thee that I am not one of tho&s;e, I will make no Apology for this, but do tell thee that I think it nece&s;|&s;ary to be prefix'd to this Trifle, to prevent thy overlooking &s;ome little pains which I have taken in the Compo&s;ition of the following Sto|ry. Romances are generally compo&s;ed of the Con&s;tant Loves and invincible Courages of He|ro's, Heroins, Kings and Queens, Mortals of the fir&s;t Rank, and &s;o forth; where lofty Language, miraculous Contingencies and im|po&s;&s;ible Performances, elevate and &s;urprize the Reader into a giddy Delight, which leaves him
<PB REF="8">
flat upon the Ground whenever he gives of, and vexes him to think how he has &s;uffer'd him|&s;elf to be plea&s;ed and tran&s;ported, concern'd and afflicted at the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which he has Read, <HI>viz.</HI> the&s;e Knights Succe&s;s to their Damo&s;els Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ortunes, and &s;uch like, when he is forced to be very well convinced that 'tis all a lye. Novels are of a more familiar Na|ture; Come near us, and repre&s;ent to us In|trigues in practice, delight us with Accidents and odd Events, but not &s;uch as are wholly un|u&s;ual or unpre&s;idented, &s;uch which not being &s;o di&s;tant from our Belief bring al&s;o the plea&s;ure nearer us. Romances give more of Wonder, Novels more Delight. And with reverence be it &s;poken, and the Parallel kept at a due di&s;tance, there is &s;omething of equality in the Proportion which they bear in reference to one another, with that between Comedy and Tra|gedy; but the <HI>Drama</HI> is the long extracted from Romance and Hi&s;tory: 'Tis the Mid|wife to Indu&s;try, and brings forth alive the Conceptions of the Brain. <HI>Minerva</HI> walks upon the Stage before us, and we are more a&s;&s;ured of the real pre&s;ence of Wit when it is delivered <HI>viva voce</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<Q><L>Segnius irritant animos demi&s;&s;a per aurem,</L>

<P><PB REF="9">
Since all Traditions mu&s;t indi&s;putably give place to the <HI>Drama,</HI> and &s;ince there is no po&s;&s;ibility of giving that life to the Writing or Repetition of a Story which it has in the Action, I re&s;olved in another beauty to imitate <HI>Dramatick</HI> Writing, namely, in the De&s;ign, Contexture and Re&s;ult of the Plot. I have not ob&s;erved it before in a Novel. Some I have &s;een begin with an unexpected accident, which has been the only &s;urprizing part of the Story, cau&s;e enough to make the Sequel look flat, tedious and in&s;ipid; for 'tis but rea&s;onable the Reader &s;hould expect it not to ri&s;e, at lea&s;t to keep upon a level in the entertain|ment; for &s;o he may be kept on in hopes that at &s;ome time or other it may mend; but the 'tother is &s;uch a balk to a Man, 'tis carrying him up &s;tairs to &s;how him the Di|ning Room, and after forcing him to make a Meal in the Kitchin. This I have not only endeavoured to avoid, but al&s;o have u&s;ed a Method for the contrary purpo&s;e. The de&s;ign of the Novel is obvious, after the fir&s;t meeting of <HI>Aurelian</HI> and <HI>Hippolito</HI> with <HI>Incognita</HI> and <HI>Leonora,</HI> and the difficulty is in bringing it to pa&s;s, maugre all apparent ob&s;tacles, within the com|pa&s;s of two Days. How many probable Ca&s;ualties intervene in oppo&s;ition to the main De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> of marrying two Couple &s;o oddly engaged in an intricate Amour, I leave the Reader at his lei&s;ure to con&s;ider: As al&s;o whether every Ob&s;tacle does not in the progre&s;s of the Story act as &s;ub&s;ervient to that purpo&s;e, which at fir&s;t it &s;eems to oppo&s;e.
<PB REF="10">
In a Comedy this would be called the &V;nity of Action; here it may pretend to no more than an &V;nity of Contrivance. The Scene is continued in <HI>Florence</HI> from the commencement of the Amour; and the time from fir&s;t to la&s;t is but three days. If there be any thing more in particular re&s;embling the Copy which I imitate (as the Curious Reader will &s;oon perceive) I leave it to &s;how it &s;elf, being very well &s;atisfy'd how much more proper it had been for him to have found out this him&s;elf, than for me to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him with an Opinion of &s;omething extraordinary in an E&s;&s;ay began and fini&s;hed in the idler hours of a fortnight's time: For I can only e&s;teem it a laborious idlene&s;s, which is Parent to &s;o incon&s;iderable a Birth. I have gratified the Book&s;eller in pretending an occa&s;ion for a Preface; the other two Per&s;ons concern'd are the Reader and my &s;elf, and if he be but plea&s;ed with what was produced for that end, my &s;atisfaction follows of Cour&s;e, &s;ince it will be proportion'd to his Approbation or Di&s;like.</P>

<HEAD><HI>INCOGNITA:</HI> OR, LOVE and DUTY RECONCIL'D.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A&V;RELIAN</HI> was the only Son to a Principal Gentleman of <HI>Florence.</HI> The Indulgence of his Father promp|ted, and his Wealth enabled him, to be&s;tow a generous Education upon him, whom, he now began to look upon as the Type of him&s;elf; an Impre&s;&s;ion he had made in the Gayety and Vigour of his Youth, before the Ru&s;t of Age had debilitated and ob&s;cur'd the Splendour of the Original: He was &s;en&s;ible, That he ought not to be &s;paring in the Adorn|ment of him, if he had Re&s;olution to beautifie his own Memory. Indeed <HI>Don Fabio</HI> (for &s;o was the Old Gentleman call'd) has been ob|&s;erv'd to have fix'd his Eyes upon <HI>Aurelian,</HI> when much Company has been at Table, and have wept through Earne&s;tne&s;s of Inten|tion, if nothing hapned to divert the Object; whether it were for regret, at the Recollection
<PB N="2" REF="12">
of his former &s;elf, or for the Joy he conceiv'd in being, as it were, reviv'd in the Per&s;on of his Son, I never took upon me to en|quire, but &s;uppos'd it might be &s;ometimes one, and &s;ometimes both together.</P>
<P><HI>Aurelian,</HI> at the Age of Eighteen Years, wanted nothing (but a Beard) that the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed <HI>Cavalier</HI> in <HI>Florence</HI> could pre|tend to: He had been Educated from Twelve Years old at <HI>Siena,</HI> where it &s;eems his Father kept a Receiver, having a large Income from the Rents of &s;everal Hou&s;es in that Town. <HI>Don Fabio</HI> gave his Servant Orders, That <HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;hould not be &s;tinted in his Expenoes, when he came up to Years of Di&s;cretion. By which means he was enabled, not only to keep Company with, but al&s;o to confer many Obligations upon Strangers of Quality, and Gentlemen who travelled from other Countries into <HI>Italy,</HI> of which <HI>Siena</HI> never wanted &s;tore, being a Town mo&s;t delightfully &s;ituate, upon a Noble Hill, and very well &s;uiting with Stran|gers at fir&s;t, by rea&s;on of the agreeablene&s;s and purity of the Air: There al&s;o is the quaintne&s;s and delicacy of the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue mo&s;t likely to be learned, there being many publick Profe&s;&s;ors of it in that place; and indeed the very Vulgar of <HI>Siena</HI> do expre&s;s them|&s;elves with an ea&s;ine&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s &s;urpri|zing, and even grateful to their Ears who under&s;tand not the Language.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Aurelian</HI> contracted an acquaintance with Per&s;ons of Worth of &s;everal Countries,
<PB N="3" REF="13">
but among the re&s;t an intimacy with a Gen|tleman of Quality of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Nephew to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> who had &s;o wrought him&s;elf into the Affections of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> thro' a Conformity of Temper, an Equality in Years, and &s;omething of re&s;emblance in Feature and Proportion, that he look'd upon him as his &s;econd &s;elf. <HI>Hippolito,</HI> on the other hand, was not ungrateful in return of Friend&s;hip, but thought him&s;elf either alone or in ill Company, if <HI>Aurelian</HI> were ab&s;ent: But his Uncle having &s;ent him to travel, under the Conduct of a Governour, and the two Years which limitted his &s;tay at <HI>Siena</HI> being expired, he was put in mind of his departure.</P>
<P>His Friend grew melancholy at the News, but con&s;idering that <HI>Hippolito</HI> had never &s;een <HI>Florence,</HI> he ea&s;ily prevailed with him to make his fir&s;t Journey thither, whither he would accompany him, and perhaps prevail with his Father to do the like throughout his Travels.</P>
<P>They accordingly &s;et out, but not being able ea&s;ily to reach <HI>Florence</HI> the &s;ame Night, they re&s;ted a League or two &s;hort, at a <HI>Villa</HI> of the great Duke's called <HI>Poggio Imperiale,</HI> where they were informed by &s;ome of his Highne&s;s's Servants, That the Nuptials of <HI>Donna Catharina</HI> (near Kin&s;woman to the great Duke) and <HI>Don Ferdinand de Rovori,</HI> were to be &s;olemnized the next day, and that extra|ordinary Preparations had been making for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to illu&s;trate the Solemnity with Balls and Ma&s;ques, and other Diverti&s;ements,
<PB N="4" REF="14">
that a Tilting had been proclaim'd, and to that purpo&s;e Scaffolds erected around the Spacious Court, before the Church <HI>Di Sancta Croce,</HI> where were u&s;ually &s;een all Cavalcades and Shews, performed by A&s;&s;emblies of the Young Nobility: That all Mechanicks and Trade&s;men were forbidden to work or expo&s;e any Goods to Sale for the &s;pace of three days; during which time all Per&s;ons &s;hould be enter|tain'd at the Great Duke's Co&s;t; and publick Provi&s;ion was to be made for the &s;etting forth and furni&s;hing a multitude of Tables, with Entertainment for all Comers and Goers, and &s;everal Hou&s;es appointed for that u&s;e in all Streets.</P>
<P>This Account alarm'd the Spirits of our Young Travellers, and they were overjoy'd at the pro&s;pect of Plea&s;ures they fore&s;aw. <HI>Aure|lian</HI> could not contain the &s;atisfaction he con|ceiv'd in the welcome Fortune had prepar'd for his dear <HI>Hippolito.</HI> In &s;hort, they both Remembred &s;o much of the plea&s;ing Relation had been made them, that they forgot to &s;leep, and were up as &s;oon as it was light, pound|ing at poor Signior <HI>Claudio</HI>'s Door (&s;o was <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Governour call'd) to rou&s;e him, that no time might be lo&s;t till they were arriv'd at <HI>Florence,</HI> where they would furni&s;h them|&s;elves with Di&s;gui&s;es and other Accoutrements nece&s;&s;ary for the Pro&s;ecution of their De&s;ign of &s;haring in the publick Merriment; the rather were they for going &s;o early becau&s;e <HI>Aurelian</HI> did not think fit to publi&s;h his being in the
<PB N="5" REF="15">
Town for a time, lea&s;t his Father knowing of it, might give &s;ome re&s;traint to that loo&s;e they de&s;ign'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before Sun ri&s;e they entred <HI>Florence</HI> at <HI>Porta Romana,</HI> attended only by two Servants, the re&s;t being le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t behind to avoid notice; but, alas! they needed not to have u&s;ed half that caution; for early as it was, the Streets were crowded with all &s;orts of People pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, and every Man employ'd in &s;ome|thing relating to the Diver&s;ions to come; &s;o that no notice was taken of any body; a Marque&s;s and his Train might have pa&s;s'd by as unregarded as a &s;ingle Fachin or Cobler. Not a Window in the Streets but echoed the tuning of a Lute or thrumming of a Gitarr: For, by the way, the Inhabitants of <HI>Florence</HI> are &s;trangely addicted to the love of Mu&s;ick, in&s;omuch that &s;carce their Children can go, before they can &s;cratch &s;ome In&s;trument or other. It was no unplea&s;ing Spectacle to our Cavaliers (who, &s;eeing they were not ob&s;erv'd, re&s;olved to make Ob&s;ervations) to behold the Diver&s;ity of Figures and Po&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es of many of the&s;e Mu&s;icians. Here you &s;hould have an affected Vallet, who Mimick'd the Beha|viour of his Ma&s;ter, leaning carele&s;ly again&s;t the Window, with his Head on one &s;ide in a langui&s;hing po&s;ture, whining, in a low, mournful Voice, &s;ome di&s;mal Complaint; while, from his &s;ympathizing <HI>Theorbo,</HI> i&s;&s;ued a Ba&s;e no le&s;s doleful to the Hearers. In Oppo&s;ition to him was &s;et up perhaps a
<PB N="6" REF="16">
Cobler, with a wretched Skeleton of a Gi|tarr, battered and waxed together by his own Indu&s;try, and who with three Strings out of Tune, and his own tearing hoar&s;e Voice, would rack attention from the Neighbourhood, to the great affliction of many more moderate Practitioners, who, no doubt, were full as de&s;irous to be heard. By this time <HI>Aure|lian</HI>'s Servant had taken a Lodging and was returned, to give his Ma&s;ter an Account of it. The Cavaliers grown weary of that ridicu|lous Entertainment, which was diverting at fir&s;t &s;ight, retired whither the Lacquey con|ducted them; who, according to their Directi|ons, had &s;ought out one of the mo&s;t ob|&s;cure Streets in the City. All that day, to the evening, was &s;pent in &s;ending from one Brokers Shop to another, to furni&s;h them with Habits, &s;ince they had not time to make any new.</P>
<P>There was, it happened, but one to be got Rich enough to plea&s;e our young Gentlemen, &s;o many were taken up upon this occa&s;ion. While they were in Di&s;pute and Compli|menting one another, (<HI>Aurelian</HI> prote&s;ting that <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;hould wear it, and he, on 'tother hand, for&s;wearing it as bitterly) a Servant of <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s came up and ended the Con|trover&s;y; telling them, That he had met below with the <HI>Vallet de Chambre</HI> of a Gentle|men, who was one of the greate&s;t Gallants about the Town, but was at this time in &s;uch a Condition he could not po&s;&s;ibly be at the
<PB N="7" REF="17">
Entertainment; whereupon the Vallet had de|&s;igned to dre&s;s him&s;elf up in his Ma&s;ter's Apparel, and try his talent at Court; which he hearing, told him he would inform him how he might be&s;tow the Habit for &s;ome time much more to his profit if not to his plea|&s;ure, and &s;o acquainted him with the occa|&s;ion his Ma&s;ter had for it. <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;ent for the Fellow up, who was not &s;o fond of his de&s;ign as not to be bought off it, but upon having his own demand granted for the u&s;e of it, brought it; it was very Rich, and upon tryal, as fit for <HI>Hippolito</HI> as if it had been made for him. The Ceremony was pre|formed in the Morning, in the great Dome, with all Magnificence corre&s;pondent to the wealth of the great Duke, and the e&s;teem he had for the Noble Pair. The next Morning was to be a Tilting, and the &s;ame Night a Ma&s;quing Ball at Court. To omit the De|&s;cription of the univer&s;al Joy, (that had diffus'd it &s;elf through all the Conduits of Wine, which convey'd it in large mea&s;ures to the People) and only relate tho&s;e effects of it which concern our pre&s;ent Adventurers: You mu&s;t know, that about the fall of the Evening, and at that time when the <HI>aequilibrium</HI> of Day and Night, for &s;ome time, holds the Air in a gloomy &s;u&s;pence between an unwillingne&s;s to leave the light, and a natural impul&s;e into the Dominion of Darkne&s;s. About this time our Hero's, &s;hall I &s;ay, &s;ally'd or &s;lunk out of their Lodgings, and &s;teer'd toward the great Palace, whither,
<PB N="8" REF="18">
before they were arriv'd, &s;uch a prodigious number of Torches were on fire, that the day, by help of the&s;e Auxiliary Forces, &s;eem'd to continue its Dominion; the Owls and Bats ap|prehending their mi&s;take, in counting the Hours, retir'd again to a convenient darkne&s;s; for Madam Night was no more to be &s;een than &s;he was to be heard; and the Chymi&s;ts were of Opinion, That her fuliginous Damps rarefy'd by the abundance of Flame, were evaporated.</P>
<P>Now the Reader I &s;uppo&s;e to be upon Thorns at this and the like impertinent Digre&s;|&s;ions, but let him alone and he'll come to him|&s;elf; at which time I think fit to acquaint him, that when I digre&s;s, I am at that time writing to plea&s;e my &s;elf; when I con|tinue the Thread of the Story, I write to plea&s;e him; &s;uppo&s;ing him a rea&s;onable Man, I con|clude him &s;atisfied to allow me this liberty, and &s;o I proceed.</P>
<P>If our Cavaliers were dazled at the &s;plen|dour they beheld without doors, what &s;urprize, think you, mu&s;t they be in, when entering the Palace they found even the lights there to be but &s;o many &s;oils to the bright eyes that fla&s;h'd upon 'em at every turn.</P>
<P>A more glorious Troop no occa&s;ion ever a&s;&s;embled; all the fair of <HI>Florence,</HI> with the mo&s;t accomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hed Cavaliers, were pre&s;ent; and however Nature had been partial in be|&s;towing on &s;ome better Faces than others, Art was alike indulgent to all, and indu&s;triou&s;ly
<PB N="9" REF="19">
&s;upplyed tho&s;e Defects &s;he had left, giving &s;ome Addition al&s;o to her greate&s;t Excellencies. Every Body appear'd well &s;hap'd, as it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, none who were con&s;cious to them&s;elves of any vi&s;ible Deformity would pre&s;ume to come thither. Their Apparel was equally glorious, though each differing in fancy. In &s;hort, our Strangers were &s;o well bred, as to conclude from the&s;e apparent Perfections, that there was not a Ma&s;que which did not at lea&s;t hide the Face of a Cherubim. Perhaps the Ladies were not behind hand in return of a favourable Opinion of them: for they were both well dre&s;s'd, and had &s;omething inex|pre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing in their Air and Mein, diffe|rent from other People, and indeed differing from one another. They fancy'd that while they &s;tood together they were more particu|larly taken notice of than any in the Room, and being unwilling to be taken for Strangers, which they thought they were, by rea&s;on of &s;ome whi&s;pering they ob&s;erved near them: They agreed upon an hour of meeting after the company &s;hould be broke up, and &s;o &s;eparate|ly mingled with the thicke&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly. <HI>Aurelian</HI> had fixed his eye upon a Lady whom he had ob&s;erv'd to have been a con&s;iderable time in clo&s;e whi&s;per with another Woman; he expected with great impatience the re&s;ult of that private Conference, that he might have an opportunity of engaging the Lady who&s;e Per&s;on was &s;o agreeable to him. At la&s;t he perceived they were broke off, and the 'tother
<PB N="10" REF="20">
Lady &s;eem'd to have taken her leave. He had taken no &s;mall Pains in the mean time to put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture to acco&s;t the Lady, which, no doubt, he had happily performed had he not been interrupted; but &s;carce had he acquitted him&s;elf of a preliminary bow (and which, I have heard him &s;ay, was the lowe&s;t that ever he made) and had ju&s;t opened his Lips to deliver him&s;elf of a &s;mall Comple|ment, which, neverthele&s;s he was very big with, when he unluckily mi&s;carried, by the interpo&s;al of the &s;ame Lady, who&s;e depar|ture, not long before, he had &s;o zealou&s;ly pray'd for: but, as Providence would have it, there was only &s;ome very &s;mall matter for|got, which was recover'd in a &s;hort whi&s;per. The Coa&s;t being again cleared, he took heart and bore up, and &s;triking &s;ail, repeated his Ce|remony to the Lady; who, having obliging|ly returned it, he acco&s;ted her in the&s;e or the like words:</P>

&s;omething like this about, and had almo&s;t de&s;pair'd of it; when of a &s;uddain he found the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;ign had prevented his own endeavours.

He thought he might ea&s;ily pretend to be indi&s;po&s;ed &s;omewhat more than ordinary, and &s;o make an excu&s;e to go to his own Lodging. It came into his Head too, that under pretence of giving her an account of his Health, he might enquire of her the means how a Letter might be convey'd to her the next Morning, wherein he might in|form her gently of her mi&s;take, and in&s;inuate &s;omething of that Pa&s;&s;ion he had conceiv'd, which he was &s;ure he could not have oppor|tunity to &s;peak of if he bluntly revealed him|&s;elf.

She was much troubled, and would have had a Chair made ready and Servants to carry him home; but he made an&s;wer, he would

not have any of her Fathers Servants know of his being abroad, and that ju&s;t now he had an interval of ea&s;e, which he hop'd would continue till he made &s;hift to reach his own Lodgings. Yet if &s;he plea&s;ed to inform him how he might give an account of him|&s;elf the next morning, in a Line or two, he would not fail to give her the thanks due to her great Kindne&s;s; and withal, would let her know &s;omething which would not a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle &s;urprize her, though now he had not time to acquaint her with it.

<P><HI>Hippolito,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he was gone in, began to make his Remarks about the Hou&s;e, walk|ing round the great Court, viewing the Gar|dens and all the Pa&s;&s;ages leading to that &s;ide of the Piazza. Having &s;ufficiently informed him|&s;elf, with a Heart full of Love, and a Head full of Stratagem, he walked toward his Lodg|ing, impatient till the arrival of <HI>Aurelian</HI> that he might give him&s;elf vent. In which inte|rim, let me take the liberty to digre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s a little, and tell the Reader &s;omething which I do not doubt he has apprehended him&s;elf long ago, if he be not the dulle&s;t Reader in the World; yet only for order &s;ake, let me tell him, I &s;ay, That a young Gentleman (Cou&s;in to the afore|&s;aid <HI>Don Fabritio</HI>) happened one night to have &s;ome words at a Gaming Hou&s;e with one <HI>Lo|renzo,</HI> which created a Quarrel of fatal Con&s;e|quence to the former, who was killed upon the Spot, and likely to be &s;o to the latter, who was very de&s;perately Wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Fabritio,</HI> being much concerned for his Kin&s;|man, vow'd revenge (according to the an|cient and laudable cu&s;tom of <HI>Italy</HI>) upon <HI>Lorenzo</HI> if he &s;urviv'd, or in ca&s;e of his Death (if it &s;hould happen to anticipate that, much more &s;winging Death which he had in &s;tore

for him) upon his next of Kin, and &s;o to de&s;cend Lineally like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> E&s;tate, to all the Heirs Males of his Family. This &s;ame <HI>Fabritio</HI> had indeed (as <HI>Leonora</HI> told <HI>Hippolito</HI>) taken particular notice of him from his fir&s;t entrance into the Room, and was &s;o far doubtful as to go out immediately him&s;elf, and make enquiry concerning <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> but was quickly inform'd of the greatne&s;s of his Error, in believing a Man to be abroad, who was &s;o ill of his Wounds, that they now de&s;pair'd of his recovery; and thereupon returned to the Ball very well &s;atisfied, but not before <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Hippolito</HI> were departed.</P>
<P>So, Reader, having now di&s;charg'd my Con|&s;cience of a &s;mall Di&s;covery which I thought my &s;elf obliged to make to thee, I proceed to tell thee, that our Friend <HI>Aurelian</HI> had by this time danced him&s;elf into a Net which he nei|ther could, nor which is wor&s;e de&s;ired to un|tangle.</P>
<P>His Soul was charm'd to the movement of her Body: An Air &s;o graceful, &s;o &s;weet, &s;o ea&s;ie and &s;o great, he had never &s;een. She had &s;omething of Maje&s;ty in her, which appear'd to be born with her; and though it &s;truck an awe into the Beholders, yet was it &s;weet|ned with a familiarity of Behaviour, which rendred it agreeable to every Body. The grandeur of her Mien was not &s;tiff, but un|&s;tudied and unforced, mixed with a &s;implicity; free, yet not loo&s;e nor affected. If the former &s;eem'd to conde&s;cend, the latter &s;eem'd to a&s;pire;

and both to unite in the centre of Perfe|ction. Every turn &s;he gave in dancing &s;natcht <HI>Aurelian</HI> into a Rapture, and he had like to have been out two or three times with the following his Eyes, which &s;he led about as Slaves to her Heels.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had done dancing, he began to complain of his want of Breath and Lungs, to &s;peak &s;ufficiently in her Commendation; She &s;milingly told him, he did ill to dance &s;o much then: Yet in Con&s;ideration of the pains he had taken more than ordinary upon her ac|count, &s;he would bate him a great deal of Compliment, but with this Provi&s;o, That he was to di&s;cover to her who he was. <HI>Aurelian</HI> was unwilling for the pre&s;ent to own him&s;elf to be really the Man he was; when a &s;ud|dain thought came into his Head to take upon him the Name and Character of <HI>Hippolito,</HI> who he was &s;ure was not known in <HI>Florence.</HI> He thereupon, after a little pau&s;e, pretended to recal him&s;elf in this manner: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Madam, it is no &s;mall demon&s;tration of the entire Re&s;ig|nation which I have made of my Heart to your Chains, &s;ince the &s;ecrets of it are no longer in my Power.

<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> interrupted her, and &s;wore very &s;o|lemnly (and the more heartily, I believe, be|cau&s;e he then indeed &s;poke truth) that he would make <HI>Florence</HI> the place of his abode, whatever concerns he had el&s;ewhere.

<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> who was really in Love, and in whom Con&s;ideration would have been a Crime, greedily embrac'd the latter, &s;ince &s;he a&s;&s;ured him at that time he &s;hould not know both.

Her Eyes diffus'd Rays comfortable as warmth, and piercing as the light; they would have worked a pa&s;&s;age through the &s;traighte&s;t Pores, and with a deli|cious heat, have play'd about the mo&s;t ob|durate frozen Heart, until 'twere melted down to Love. Such Maje&s;ty and Affability were in her Looks; &s;o alluring, yet commanding was her Pre&s;ence, that it mingled awe with love; kindling a Flame which trembled to a&s;pire. She had dancedmuch, which, to|gether with her being clo&s;e masked, gave her a tincture of Carnation more than or|dinary.

on her Lips, on which they drank and revell'd for their pains; Nay, &s;o particular were their allotments in her &s;ervice, that <HI>Aurelian</HI> was very po&s;itive a young Cupid who was but ju&s;t Pen-feather'd, employ'd his naked Quills to pick her Teeth. And a Thou&s;and other Things his Tran&s;port Re|pre&s;ented to him, which none but Lovers who have experience of &s;uch Vi&s;ions will believe.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he awaked and found his Speech come to him, he employ'd it to this effect:</P>

<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> was growing a little too loud with his Admiration, had &s;he not ju&s;t then inter|rupted him, by clapping on her Ma&s;que, and telling him they &s;hould be ob&s;erved, if he proceeded in his Extravagance; and withal, that his Pa&s;&s;ion was too &s;uddain to be real, and too violent to be la&s;ting. He replied, Indeed it might not be very la&s;ting, (with a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive mournful Voice) but it would continue
<PB N="30" REF="40">
during his Life. That it was &s;uddain, he denied, for &s;he had rai&s;ed it by degrees from his fir&s;t &s;ight of her, by a continued di&s;covery of Charms, in her Mein and Conver&s;ation, till &s;he thought fit to &s;et Fire to the Train &s;he had laid, by the Lightning of her Face; and then he could not help it, if he were blown up.</P>
<P>He begg'd her to believe the Sincerity of his Pa&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t to enjoin him &s;omething, which might tend to the Convincing of her Incredulity. She &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould find a time to make &s;ome Trials of him; but for the fir&s;t, &s;he charged him not to follow or ob&s;erve her, after the Di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly. He promi&s;ed to obey, and entreated her to tell him but her Name, that he might have Re|cour&s;e to that in his Affliction for her Ab&s;ence, if he were able to &s;urvive it. She de&s;ired him to live by all means; and if he mu&s;t have a Name to play with, to call her <HI>Incognita,</HI> till he were better informed.</P>
<P>The Company breaking up, &s;he took her leave, and at his earne&s;t Entreaty, gave him a &s;hort Vi&s;ion of her Face; which, then dre&s;s'd in an obliging &s;mile, cau&s;ed another fit of Tran&s;port, which la&s;ted till &s;he was gone out of Sight. <HI>Aurelian</HI> gathered up his Spirits, and walked &s;lowly towards his Lodging, ne|ver remembring that he had lo&s;t <HI>Hippolito,</HI> till upon turning the Corner of a Street, he heard a noi&s;e of Fighting; and coming near, &s;aw a Man make a vigorous Defence again&s;t two, who pre&s;&s;ed violently upon him. He then
<PB N="31" REF="41">
thought of <HI>Hippolito,</HI> and fancying he &s;aw the glimmering of Diamond Buttons, &s;uch as <HI>Hip|polito</HI> had upon the Sleeves of his Habit, im|mediately drew to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and with that Eagerne&s;s and Re&s;olution, that the A&s;&s;ail|ants, finding their unmanly odds defeated, took to their Heels. The Per&s;on re&s;cued by the Generous Help of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> came toward him; but as he would have &s;toop'd to have &s;aluted him, dropp'd, fainting at his feet. <HI>Aurelian,</HI> now he was &s;o near him, perceiv'd plainly <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Habit, and &s;tep'd ha&s;tily to take him up. Ju&s;t as &s;ome of the Guards (who were going the Rounds, apprehen&s;ive of &s;uch Di&s;|orders in an Univer&s;al Merriment) came up to him with Lights, and had taken Pri&s;oners the Two Men, whom they met with their Swords drawn; when looking in the Face of the Wounded Man, he found it was not <HI>Hip|polito,</HI> but his Governour <HI>Claudio,</HI> in the Habit he had worn at the Ball. He was extreamly &s;urpriz'd, as were the Pri&s;oners, who confe&s;s'd their De&s;ign to have been upon <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> grounding their Mi&s;take upon the Habit which was known to have been his. They were Two Men who formerly had been Servants to him whom <HI>Lorenzo</HI> had unfortunately &s;lain.</P>
<P>They made a &s;hift to bring <HI>Claudio</HI> to him|&s;elf; and part of the Guard carrying off the Pri&s;oners, whom <HI>Aurelian</HI> de&s;ired they would &s;ecure, the re&s;t accompanied him bearing <HI>Clau|dio</HI> in their Arms to his Lodging. He had not patience to forbear asking for <HI>Hippolito</HI> by the
<PB N="32" REF="42">
Way; whom <HI>Claudio</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, he had left &s;afe in his Chamber, above Two Hours &s;ince. That his coming Home &s;o long before the Di|verti&s;ements were ended, and Undre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf, had given him the Unhappy Curio&s;ity, to put on his Habit, and go to the Palace; in his Return from whence, he was &s;et upon in the Manner he found him, which if he reco|vered, he mu&s;t own his Life indebted to his timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Being come to the Hou&s;e, they carried him to his Bed, and having &s;ent for Surgeons <HI>Aure|lian</HI> rewarded and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Guard. He &s;tay'd the dre&s;&s;ing of <HI>Claudio</HI>'s Wounds, which were many, though they hop'd none Mortal: and leaving him to his Re&s;t, went to give <HI>Hippolito</HI> an Account of what had happened, whom he found with a Table before him, leaning upon both his Elbows, his Face co|vered with his Hands, and &s;o motionle&s;s, that <HI>Aurelian</HI> concluded he was a&s;leep; &s;eeing &s;everal Papers lie before him, half written and blot|ted out again, he thought to &s;teal &s;oftly to the Table, and di&s;cover what he had been em|ployed about. Ju&s;t as he reach'd forth his Hand to take up one of the Papers, <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;tarted up &s;o on the &s;uddain, as &s;urpriz'd <HI>Au|relian</HI> and made him leap back; <HI>Hippolito,</HI> on the other hand, not &s;uppo&s;ing that any Body had been near him, was &s;o di&s;ordered with the Appearance of a Man at his Elbow, (whom his Amazement did not permit him to di&s;tingui&s;h) that he leap'd ha&s;tily to his Sword,
<PB N="33" REF="43">
and in turning him about, overthrew the Stand and Candles. Here were they both left in the Dark, <HI>Hippolito</HI> groping about with his Sword, and thru&s;ting at every Chair that he felt oppo&s;e him. <HI>Aurelian</HI> was &s;carce come to him&s;elf, when thinking to &s;tep back toward the Door that he might inform his Friend of his Mi|&s;take, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to his blind Fury; <HI>Hippolito</HI> heard him &s;tir, and made a full thru&s;t with &s;uch Violence, that the Hilt of the Sword meeting with <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s Brea&s;t beat him down, and <HI>Hippolito</HI> a top of him, as a Servant alarmed with the noi&s;e, came into the Chamber with a Light. The Fellow trembled, and thought they were both Dead, till <HI>Hippolito</HI> rai&s;ing him&s;elf, to &s;ee whom he had got under him, &s;woon'd away upon the di&s;covery of his Friend. But &s;uch was the extraordinary Care of Providence in directing the Sword, that it only pa&s;t under his Arm, giving no Wound to <HI>Aurelian,</HI> but a little Brui&s;e between his Shoulder and Brea&s;t with the Hilt. He got up, &s;carce recovered of his Fright, and by the help of the Servant laid <HI>Hippotito</HI> upon the Bed; who when he was come to him&s;elf could hardly be per&s;waded, that his Friend was before him and alive, till he &s;hew'd him his Brea&s;t, where was nothing of a Wound. <HI>Hippolito</HI> begg'd his Pardon a Thou&s;and Times, and curs'd him&s;elf as often, who was &s;o near to committing the la&s;t Execrable Act of Ami|cide.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="44">
They di&s;mi&s;s'd the Fellow, and with many Embraces, congratulated their fortunate Deli|very from the Mi&s;chief which came &s;o near them, each blaming him&s;elf as the Occa&s;ion: <HI>Aurelian</HI> accu&s;ing his own unadvi&s;edne&s;s in &s;tealing upon <HI>Hippolito; Hippolito</HI> blaming his own temerity and weakne&s;s, in being &s;o ea&s;ily frighted to Di&s;order; and la&s;t of all, his blindne&s;s, in not knowing his deare&s;t Friend. But there he gave a Sigh, and pa&s;&s;ionately taking <HI>Aurelian</HI> by the Hand, cry'd, Ah! my Friend, Love is indeed blind, when it would not &s;uffer me to &s;ee you&mdash;There aro&s;e another Sigh; a Sympathy &s;eized <HI>Aurelian</HI> immediately: (For, by the Way, &s;ighing is as catching among Lovers, as yawning among the Vulgar.) Be&s;ide hearing the Name of Love, made him fetch &s;uch a Sigh, that <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s were but Fly-blows in Compari&s;on, that was an&s;wered with all the Might <HI>Hippolito</HI> had. <HI>Aurelian</HI> ply'd him clo&s;e till they were both out of Breath.</P>
<P>Thus not a Word pa&s;s'd, though each won|dred why the t'other &s;igh'd, at la&s;t concluded it to be only Complai&s;ance to one another.</P>
<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> broke the Silence, by telling him, the Misfortune of his Governour. <HI>Hippolito</HI> rejoy'd as at the luckie&s;t Accident which could have befallen him. <HI>Aurelian</HI> wondred at his un&s;ea&s;onable Mirth, and demanded the Cau&s;e of it; he an&s;wered, It would nece&s;&s;itate his longer &s;tay in <HI>Florence,</HI> and for ought he knew be the Means of bringing a happy Period to his Amour.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="45">
His Friend thought him to be little better than a Mad-man, when he perceiv'd him of a &s;uddain &s;natch out of his Bo&s;om a Handker|chief, which having ki&s;s'd with a great deal of Ardour, he took <HI>Aurelian</HI> by the Hand, and &s;miling at the Surprize he &s;aw him in;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Your <HI>Florentine Cupid</HI> is certainly (&s;aid he) the mo&s;t Expert in the World. I have &s;ince I &s;aw you beheld the mo&s;t Beautiful of Wo|men.

<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;eeing the Rapture he was in, thought it in vain to expect a &s;ettled Relation of the Adventure, &s;o was reaching to the Table for &s;ome of the Papers, but <HI>Hippolito</HI> told him, Ifhe would have a little Patience he would ac|quaint him with the whole Matter; and thereupon told him Word for Word how he was mi&s;taken for <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and his Management of him&s;elf. <HI>Aurelian</HI> commended his Prudence, in not di&s;covering him&s;elf; and told him, If
<PB N="36" REF="46">
he could &s;pare &s;o much time from the Contem|plation of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he would inform him of an Adventure, though not &s;o Accidental, yet of as great Concern to his own future Happine&s;s. So related all that had happened to him with his Beautiful <HI>Incognita.</HI></P>
<P>Having ended the Story, they began to con&s;ider of the means they were to u&s;e to|ward a Review of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. <HI>Aurelian</HI> was Confounded at the Difficulty he conceived on his Part. He under&s;tood from <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Adventure, that his Father knew of his being in Town, whom he mu&s;t unavoidably Di&s;oblige if he yet conceal'd him&s;elf, and Di&s;obey if he came into his Sight; for he had already enter|tain'd an Aver&s;ion for <HI>Juliana,</HI> in apprehen&s;ion of her being impo&s;ed on him. His <HI>Incognita</HI> was rooted in his Heart, yet could he not Com|fort him&s;elfwith any Hopes when he &s;hould &s;ee her: He knew not where &s;he lived, and &s;he had made him no Promi&s;e of a &s;econd Confe|rence. Then did he repent his incon&s;iderate Choice, in preferring the momentary Vi&s;ion of her Face, to a certain Intelligence of Her Per&s;on. Every thought that &s;ucceeded di&s;tracted him, and all the Hopes he could pre&s;ume upon, were within compa&s;s of the Two Days Merriment yet to come; for which Space he hop'd he might excu&s;e his remaining conceal'd to his Fa|ther.</P>
<P><HI>Hippolito</HI> on the other &s;ide (tho' <HI>Aurelian</HI> thought him in a much better Way) was no le&s;s afflicted for him&s;elf. The Difficulties which
<PB N="37" REF="47">
he &s;aw in his Friend's Circum&s;tances, put him upon finding out a great many more in his own, than really there were. But what terrified him mo&s;t of all, was his being an utter Stranger to <HI>Leonora;</HI> &s;he had not the lea&s;t knowledge of him but through mi&s;take, and con&s;equently could form no Idea of him to his Advantage. He look'd upon it as an unlucky thought in <HI>Au|relian</HI> to take upon him his Name, &s;ince po&s;&s;ibly the Two Ladies were acquainted, and &s;hould they communicate each other their Adven|tures, they might both rea&s;onably &s;uffer in their Opinions, and be thought guilty of Fal|&s;hood, &s;ince it would appear to them as One Per&s;on pretending to Two. <HI>Aurelian</HI> told him, there was but one Remedy for that, which was for <HI>Hippolito,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner that he had done, to make u&s;e of his Name, when he writ to <HI>Leonora,</HI> and u&s;e what Arguments he could to per&s;wade her to Secrecy, lea&s;t his Fa|ther &s;hould know of the Rea&s;on which kept him concealed in Town. And it was likely, tho' perhaps &s;he might not immediately entertain his Pa&s;&s;ion; yet &s;he would out of Genero&s;ity conceal, what was hidden only for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>Well, this was concluded on, after a great many other Rea&s;ons u&s;ed on either Side, in favour of the Contrivance; they at la&s;t argued them&s;elves into a Belief, that Fortune had be|friended them with a better Plot, than their re|gular Thinking could have contriv'd. So &s;oon had they convinc'd them&s;elves, in what they were willing to believe.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="48">
<HI>Aurelian</HI> laid him&s;elf down to re&s;t, that is, upon the Bed; for he was a better Lover than to pretend &s;leep that Night, while <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;et him&s;elf again to frame his Letter de&s;ign'd for <HI>Leonora.</HI> He writ &s;everal, at la&s;t pitched upon one, and very probably the wor&s;t, as you may gue&s;s when you read it in its proper Place.</P>
<P>It was break of Day when the Servant, who had been employed all the foregoing Day in procuring Accoutrements for the Two Cava|liers, to appear in at the Tilting, came into the Room, and told them all the Young Gentlemen in the Town were trying their Equipage, and preparing to be early in the Li&s;ts. They made them&s;elves ready with all Expedition at the A|larm: And <HI>Hippolito</HI> having made a Vi&s;it to his Governour, di&s;patch'd a Me&s;&s;enger with the Letter and Directions to <HI>Leonora.</HI> At the Signal agreed upon the Ca&s;ement was opened and a String let down, to which the Bearer having fa&s;tned the Letter, &s;aw it drawn up, and re|turned. It were a vain attempt to de&s;cribe <HI>Leonora</HI>'s Surprize, when &s;he read the Super|&s;cription.&mdash;<HI>The &V;nfortunate</HI> Aurelian, <HI>to the Beautiful</HI> Leonora&mdash;After &s;he was a little recovered from her Amaze, &s;he recollected to her &s;elf all the Pa&s;&s;ages between her and her &s;uppo&s;ed Cou&s;in, and immediately concluded him to be <HI>Aurelian.</HI> Then &s;everal little Cir|cum&s;tances which &s;he thought might have been &s;ufficient to have convinced her, repre&s;ented them&s;elves to her; and &s;he was in a &s;trange Unea&s;ine&s;s to think of her free Carriage to a Stranger.</P>

She wondred at her own Blindne&s;s, &s;he fancy'd &s;he cou'd re|member &s;omething of a more becoming Air in the Stranger than was u&s;ual to <HI>Lorenzo.</HI> This thought was parent to another of the &s;ame kind, till a long Chain &s;ucce&s;&s;ively had Birth, and eve|ry one &s;omewhat more than other, in Favour of the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Aurelian.</HI> She reflected upon his Di&s;cretion, in deferring the Di&s;covery of him|&s;elf, till a little time had, as it were, weaned her from her per&s;wa&s;ion, and by removing her farther from her mi&s;take, had prepar'd her for a full and determinate Convincement. She thought his Behaviour, in per&s;onating a Sick Man &s;o readily, upon the fir&s;t hint was not a|mi&s;s, and &s;mil'd to think of his Excu&s;e to pro|cure her Handkerchief; and la&s;t of all, his &s;ift|ing out the Means to write to her, which he had done with that Mode&s;ty and Re&s;pect, &s;he could not tell how to find fault with it.</P>
<P>She had proceeded thus far in a maze of Thought, when &s;he &s;tarted to find her &s;elf &s;o lo&s;t to her Rea&s;on, and would have trod back again that path of deluding Fancy; accu&s;ing her &s;elf of Fondne&s;s, and incon&s;iderate Ea&s;i|ne&s;s, in giving Credit to the Letter of a Per&s;on who&s;e Face &s;he never &s;aw, and who&s;e fir&s;t Ac|quaintance with her was a Treachery, and he
<PB N="42" REF="52">
who could &s;o readily deliver his Tongue of a Lye upon a Surprize, was &s;carce to be tru&s;ted when he had &s;ufficient Time allow'd him to beget a Fiction, and Means to perfect the Birth.</P>
<P>How did &s;he know this to be <HI>Aurelian,</HI> if he were? Nay farther, put it to the Extremity, What if &s;he &s;hould upon farther Conver&s;ation with him proceed to Love him? What Hopes were there for her? Or how could &s;he con&s;ent to Marry a Man already de&s;tin'd for another Woman? Nay, a Woman that was her Friend, who&s;e Marrying with him was to compleat the happy Reconciliation of Two Noble Fami|lies, and which might prevent the Effu&s;ion of much Blood likely to be &s;hed in that Quarrel: Be&s;ides, &s;he &s;hould incurr &s;hare of the Guilt, which he would draw upon him by Di&s;obedi|ence to his Father, whom &s;he was &s;ure would not be con&s;enting to it.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;trange now, but all Accounts agree, that ju&s;t here <HI>Leonora,</HI> who had run like a vio|lent Stream again&s;t <HI>Aurelian</HI> hitherto, now re|torted with as much precipitation in his Favour. I could never get any Body to give me a &s;atis|factory Rea&s;on, for her &s;uddain and dexterous Change of Opinion ju&s;t at that &s;top, which made me conclude &s;he could not help it; and that Nature boil'd over in her at that time when it had &s;o fair an Opportunity to &s;how it &s;elf: For <HI>Leonora</HI> it &s;eems was a Woman Beautiful, and otherwi&s;e of an exellent Di&s;po&s;ition; but in the Bottom a very Woman. This la&s;t Ob|jection, this Opportunity of per&s;wading Man to
<PB N="43" REF="53">
Di&s;obedience, determined the Matter in Favour of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> more than all his Excellencies and Qualifications, take him as <HI>Aurelian,</HI> or <HI>Hippo|lito,</HI> or both together.</P>
<P>Well, the Spirit of Contradiction and of <HI>Eve</HI> was &s;trong in her; and &s;he was in a fair Way to Love <HI>Aurelian,</HI> for &s;he lik'd him already; that it was <HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;he no longer doubted, for had it been a Villain, who had only taken his Name upon him for any ill De&s;igns, he would never have &s;lip'd &s;o favourable an opportunity as when they were alone, and in the Night co|ming through the Garden and broad Space be|fore the Piazza. In &s;hort, thus much &s;he re|&s;olv'd at lea&s;t to conceal the Knowledge &s;he had of him, as he had entreated her in his Let|ter, and to make particular Remarks of his Be|haviour that Day in the Li&s;ts, which &s;hould it happen to Charm her with an ab&s;olute liking of his Per&s;on, &s;he re&s;olv'd to dre&s;s her &s;elf to the be&s;t Advantage, and mu&s;ter up all her Graces, out of pure Revenge to kill him down right.</P>
<P>I would not have the Reader now be imper|tinent, and look upon this to be force, or a whim of the Author's, that a Woman &s;hould proceed &s;o far in the Approbation of a Man whom &s;he never &s;aw, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, there|fore ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e it. Let me tell &s;uch a Critick, that he knows nothing of the Sex, if he does not know that a Woman may be ta|ken with the Character and De&s;cription of a Man when general and extraordinary, that &s;he
<PB N="44" REF="54">
may be prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an agreeable Idea of his Per&s;on and Conver&s;ation; and though &s;he cannot imagine his real Features, or manner of Wit, yet &s;he has a general Notion of what is call'd a fine Gentleman, and is prepar'd to like &s;uch a one who does not di&s;agree with that Cha|racter. <HI>Aurelian,</HI> as he bore a very fair Cha|racter, &s;o was he extreamly de&s;erving to make it good, which otherways might have been to his pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">es, through an impru|dent Indu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to our Friends merit, we give &s;o large a De&s;cription of his Excellencies, that People more more room in their Expectation, than the Intrin&s;ick worth of the Man will fill, which renders him &s;o much the more de&s;pica|ble as there is emptine&s;s to &s;pare. 'Tis cer|tain, though the Women &s;eldom find that out; for though they do not &s;ee &s;o much in a Man as was promi&s;ed, yet they will be &s;o kind to ima|gine he has &s;ome hidden excellencies which time may di&s;cover to them, &s;o are content to allow him a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their e&s;teem, and take him into Favour upon Tick. <HI>Aure|lian</HI> as he had good Credit &s;o he had a good Stock to &s;upport it, and his Per&s;on was a good promi&s;ing Security for the payment of any O|bligation he could lie under to the Fair Sex. <HI>Hippolito,</HI> who at this time was our <HI>Aurelian,</HI> did not at all le&s;&s;en him in appearing for him: So that although <HI>Leonora</HI> was indeed mi&s;ta|ken, &s;he could not be &s;aid to be much in the wrong. I could find in my Heart to beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion, if I

thought he would be &s;en&s;ible of the Civility; for I promi&s;e him, I do not intend to do it again throughout the Story, though I make ne|ver &s;o many, and though he take them never &s;o ill. But becau&s;e I began this upon a bare Suppo&s;ition of his Impertinence, which might be &s;omewhat Impertinent in me to &s;uppo&s;e I do, and hope to make him amends by telling him, that by the time <HI>Leonora</HI> was dre&s;s'd, &s;everal Ladies of her Acquaintance came to accompa|ny her to the place de&s;igned for the Tilting, where we will leave them Drinking Chocolate till 'tis time for them to go.</P>
<P>Our Cavaliers had by good Fortune provided them&s;elves of two Curious Suits of Light Ar|mour, finely Enamelled and Gilt. <HI>Hippolito</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Poggio Imperiale</HI> for a couple of fine led Hor&s;es which he had left there with the re&s;t of his Train at his entrance into <HI>Florence.</HI> Mounted on the&s;e, and every way well Equipt, they took their way, attended only by two Lacqueys, toward the Church <HI>di Sancta Croce,</HI> before which they were to perform their Exer|ci&s;es of Chivalry. <HI>Hippolito</HI> wore upon his Helm a large Plume of Crim&s;on Feathers, in the mid&s;t of which was artificially placed <HI>Leo|nora</HI>'s Handkerchief. His Armour was gilt, and Enamell'd with Green and Crim&s;on. <HI>Aure|lian</HI> was not &s;o happy as to were any token to recommend him to the Notice of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;o had only a Plume of Sky-colour and White Feathers, &s;uitable to his Armour, which was Silver Enamelled with Azure. I &s;hall not de&s;cribe
<PB N="46" REF="56">
the Habit of any other Cavaliers, or of the Ladies; let it &s;uffice to tell the Reader they were all very Fine and very Glorious, and let him dre&s;s them in what is mo&s;t agreeable to his own Fancy.</P>
<P>Our Gallants entred the Li&s;ts, and having made their Obey&s;ance to his Highne&s;s, turned round to &s;alute and view the Company. The Scaffold was circular, &s;o that there was no end of the Delightful Pro&s;pect. It &s;eem'd a Glory of Beauty which &s;hone around the Ad|miring Beholders. Our Lovers &s;oon perceiv'd the Stars which were to Rule their De&s;tiny, which &s;parkled a Lu&s;tre beyond all the Infe|riour Con&s;tellations, and &s;eem'd like two Suns to di&s;tribute Light to all the Planets in that Heavenly Sphere. <HI>Leonora</HI> knew her Slave by his Badge, and blu&s;hed till the Lillies and Ro&s;es in her Cheeks had re&s;emblance to the Plume of Crim&s;on and White Handkerchief in <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Cre&s;t. He made her a low Bow, and reined his Hor&s;e back with an extraor|dinary Grace, into a re&s;pectful Retreat. <HI>Aure|lian</HI> &s;aw his Angel his Beautiful <HI>Incognita,</HI> and had no other way to make him&s;elf known to her, but by &s;aluting and bowing to her after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> mode; &s;he gue&s;s'd him by it to be her new Servant <HI>Hippolito,</HI> and &s;ignified her appre|hen&s;ion, by making him a more particular and obliging return, than to any of the Cavaliers who had &s;aluted her before.</P>
<P>The Exerci&s;e which was to be perform'd was in general a running at the Ring, and afterwards
<PB N="47" REF="57">
two Cavaliers undertook to defend the Beauty of <HI>Donna Catharina,</HI> again&s;t all who would not allow her preheminence of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. This thing was only de&s;ign'd for &s;how and form, none pre&s;uming that any Body would put &s;o great an affront upon the Bride and Duke's Kin&s;woman, as to di&s;pute her preten&s;ions to the fir&s;t place in the Court of <HI>Venus.</HI> But here our Cavaliers were under a mi&s;take; for &s;eeing a large Shield carry'd before two Knights, with a Lady painted upon it; not knowing who, but reading the In&s;cription which was (in large Gold Letters) <HI>Above the In&s;olence of Competition.</HI> They thought them|&s;elves obliged, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ence of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to vindicate their Beauty; and were ju&s;t &s;purring on to engage the Champions, when a Gentleman &s;topping them, told them their mi&s;take, that it was the Picture of <HI>Donna Ca|tharina,</HI> and a particular Honour done to her by his Highne&s;s's Commands, and not to be di&s;puted. Upon this they would have re|turn'd to their Po&s;t, much concerned for their mi&s;take; but notice being taken by <HI>Don Fer|dinand</HI> of &s;ome Show of Oppo&s;ition that was made, he would have begg'd leave of the Duke, to have maintained his Lady's Honour again&s;t the In&s;olence of tho&s;e Cavaliers; but the Duke would by no means permit it. They were arguing about it when one of them came up, before whom the Shield was born, and demanded his Highne&s;s's Permi&s;&s;ion, to inform tho&s;e Gentlemen better of their mi&s;take, by
<PB N="48" REF="58">
giving them the Foyl. By the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> leave was given them; where upon a Civil Challenge was &s;ent to the two Strangers, informing them of their Error, and withal telling them they mu&s;t either maintain it by Force of Arms, or make a publick acknow|ledgment by riding bear headed before the Picture once round the Li&s;ts. The Stranger|Cavaliers remon&s;trated to the Duke how &s;en|&s;ible they were of their Error, and though they would not ju&s;tifie it, yet they could not decline the Combate, being pre&s;&s;ed to it be|yond an honourable refu&s;al. To the Bride they &s;ent a Complement, wherein, having fir&s;t begg'd her pardon for not knowing her Picture, they gave her to under&s;tand, that now they were not about to di&s;pute her undoubted right to the Crown of Beauty, but the Honour of being her Champions was the Prize they &s;ought for, which they thought them&s;elves as able to maintain as any other Pretenders. Wherefore they pray'd her, that if Fortune &s;o far befriended their endeavours as to make them Victors, that they might receive no other Re|ward, but to be crown'd with the Titles of their Adver&s;aries, and be ever after e&s;teem'd as her mo&s;t humble Servants. The excu&s;e was &s;o hand&s;omly de&s;igned, and much better ex|pre&s;s'd than it it here, that it took effect. The Duke <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> and his Lady were &s;o well &s;atisfied with it as to grant their Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>While the running at the Ring la&s;ted, our Cavaliers alternately bore away great &s;hare of
<PB N="94" REF="59">
the Honour. That Sport ended, Mar&s;hals were appointed for the Field, and every thing in great form &s;ettled for the Combat. The Ca|valiers were all in good earne&s;t, but orders were given to bring 'em blunted Lances, and to for|bid the drawing of a Sword upon pain of his Highne&s;s's Di&s;plea&s;ure. The Trumpets &s;ound|ed and they began their Cour&s;e: The Ladies Hearts, particularly the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cognita</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI>'s beat time to the Hor&s;es Hoof, and hope and fear made a mock Fight within their tender Brea&s;ts, each wi&s;hing and doubting &s;ucce&s;s where &s;he lik'd: But as the generality of their Prayers were for the graceful Strangers, they accord|ingly &s;ucceeded. <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s Adver&s;ary was un|hor&s;ed in the fir&s;t Encounter, and <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s lo&s;t both his Stirrups and dropt his Lance to &s;ave him&s;elf. The Honour of the Field was immediately granted to them, and <HI>Donna Catha|rina</HI> &s;ent them both Favours, which &s;he pray'd them to wear as her Knights. The Crowd breaking up, our Cavaliers made a &s;hift to &s;teal off unmarked, &s;ave by the watchful <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Incognita,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were never off from their re&s;pective Servants. There was enquiry made for them, but to no purpo&s;e; for they, to prevent their being di&s;cover'd, had prepared another Hou&s;e, di&s;tant from their Lodging, where a Servant attended to di&s;arm them, and another carried back their Hor&s;es to the <HI>Villa,</HI> while they walked un&s;u|&s;pected to their Lodging; but <HI>Incognita</HI> had given command to a Page to dog 'em till the
<PB N="50" REF="60">
Evening, at a di&s;tance, and bring her word where they were late&s;t hou&s;ed.</P>
<P>While &s;everal Conjectures pa&s;s'd among the Company, who were all gone to Dinner at the Palace, who tho&s;e Cavaliers &s;hould be, <HI>Don Fabio</HI> thought him&s;elf the only Man able to gue&s;s; for he knew for certain that his Son and <HI>Hippolito</HI> were both in Town, and was well enough plea&s;ed with his humour of re|maining <HI>Incognito</HI> till the Diver&s;ions &s;hould be over, believing then that the &s;urpize of his Di&s;covery would add much to the Gallantry he had &s;hown in Ma&s;querade; but hearing the extraordinary liking that every body ex|pre&s;s'd, and in a particular manner, the great Duke him&s;elf, to the Per&s;ons and Behaviour of the unknown Cavaliers, the Old Gen|tleman could not forbear the Vanity to tell his Highne&s;s, that he believed he had an intere&s;t in one of the Gentlemen, whom he was plea&s;ed to honour with &s;o favourable a Character; and told him what rea&s;on he had to believe the one to be his Son, and the other a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nobleman, his Friend.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery having thus got vent, was diffu&s;ed like Air; every body &s;uck'd it in, and let it out again with their Breath to the next they met withal; and in half an hours time it was talked of in the Hou&s;e where our Adven|turers were lodged. <HI>Aurelian</HI> was &s;tark mad at the News, and knew what &s;earch would be immediately made for him. <HI>Hippolito,</HI> had he not been de&s;perately in Love, would certainly
<PB N="51" REF="61">
have taken Hor&s;e and rid out of Town ju&s;t then; for he could make no longer doubt of being di&s;covered, and he was afraid of the ju&s;t Exceptions <HI>Leonora</HI> might make to a Per&s;on who had now deceived her twice. Well, we will leave them both fretting and contriving to no purpo&s;e, to look about and &s;ee what was done at the Palace, where their doom was determined much quicker than they ima|gined.</P>
<P>Dinner ended, the Duke retired with &s;ome cho&s;en Friends to a Gla&s;s of Wine; a|mong whom were the Marque&s;s of <HI>Viterbo</HI> and <HI>Don Fabio.</HI> His Highne&s;s was no Stranger to the long Fewd that had been between the two Families, and al&s;o under&s;tood what O|vertures of Reconciliation had been lately made, with the Propo&s;als of Marriage be|tween <HI>Aurelian</HI> and the Marque&s;s's Daugh|ter. Having waited till the Wine had taken the effect propo&s;ed, and the Company were rais'd to an uncommon pitch of Chearfulne&s;, which he al&s;o encouraged by an Example of Freedom and Good Humour, he took an op|portunity of rallying the two grave Signior's into an Accommodation: That was &s;econded with the prai&s;es of the young Couple, and the whole Company joined in a large Encomi|um upon the Graces of <HI>Aurelian</HI> and the Beau|ties of <HI>Juliana.</HI> The old Fellows were tickled with Delight to hear their Darlings &s;o ad|mired, which the Duke perceiving, out of a Principle of Genero&s;ity and Friend&s;hip, urged
<PB N="52" REF="62">
the pre&s;ent Con&s;ummation of the Mar|riage; telling them there was yet one day of publick Rejoycing to come, and how glad he &s;hould be to have it improved by &s;o ac|ceptable an Alliance; and what an honour it would be to have his Cou&s;in's Marriage at|tended by the Conjunction of &s;o extraordi|nary a Pair, the performance of which Cere|mony would crown the Joy that was then in Agitation, and make the la&s;t day vie for equal Glory and Happine&s;s with the fir&s;t. In &s;hort, by the Complai&s;ant and Per&s;wa&s;ive Authority of the Duke, the <HI>Dons</HI> were wrought into a Compliance, and accordingly embraced and &s;hook Hands upon the Matter. This News was di&s;per&s;ed like the former, and <HI>Don Fabio</HI> gave orders for the enquiring out his Son's Lodging, that the Marque&s;s and he might make him a Vi&s;it, as &s;oon as he had acquam|ted <HI>Juliana</HI> with his purpo&s;e, that &s;he might prepare her &s;elf. He found her very chearful with <HI>Donna Catharina</HI> and &s;everal other La|dies; whereupon the old Gentleman, pretty well warmed with the Duke's Good fellow&s;hip, told her aloud he was come to crown their Mirth with another Wedding; that his High|ne&s;s had been plea&s;ed to provide a Husband for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Daughter, and he would have her pro|vide her &s;elf to receive him to morrow. All the Company at fir&s;t, as well as <HI>Juliana</HI> her &s;elf, thought he had rally'd, till the Duke coming in confirmed the &s;erious part of his Di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Juliana</HI> was confounded at the
<PB N="53" REF="63">
ha&s;te that was impo&s;ed on her, and de&s;ired a little time to con&s;ider what &s;he was about. But the Marque&s;s told her, &s;he &s;hould have all the re&s;t of her Life to con&s;ider in; that <HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;hould come and con&s;ider with her in the Morning, if &s;he plea&s;ed; but in the mean time, he advi&s;ed her to go home and call her Maids to Coun&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Juliana</HI> took her leave of the Company very gravely, as if not much delighted with her Father's Rallery. <HI>Leonora</HI> happened to be by; and heard all that pa&s;&s;ed; &s;he was ready to &s;woon, and found her &s;elf &s;eized with a more violent Pa&s;&s;ion than ever for <HI>Aurelian:</HI> Now upon her apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing him, her active fancy had brought him before her with all the Advantages imaginable, and tho' &s;he had before &s;ound great tenderne&s;s in her Inclination toward him, yet was &s;he &s;ome|what &s;urprized to find &s;he really lov'd him. She was &s;o unea&s;ie at what &s;he had heard, that &s;he thought it convenient to &s;teal out of the pre&s;ence and retire to her Clo&s;et, to bemoan her unhappy helple&s;s Condition.</P>
<P>Our Two Cavalier-Lovers had rack'd their Invention till it was quite di&s;abled, and could not make di&s;covery of one Contrivance more for their Relief. Both &s;at &s;ilent, each depend|ing upon his Friend, and &s;till expecting when t'other &s;hould &s;peak. Night came upon them while they &s;ate thus thoughtle&s;s, or rather drowned in Thought; but a Servant bring|ing Lights into the Room awakened them:
<PB N="54" REF="64">
And <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Speech, u&s;her'd by a profound Sigh, broke Silence.</P>
<P>'Well! (&s;aid he) what mu&s;t we do, <HI>Aure|lian?</HI> We mu&s;t &s;uffer, replied <HI>Aurelian</HI> faintly. When immediately rai&s;ing his Voice, he cry'd out, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh ye unequal Powers, why do ye urge us to de&s;ire what ye doom us to forbear; give us a Will to chu&s;e, then curb us with a Duty to re&s;train that Choice!

<P>Here a &s;uddain &s;top gave a Period al&s;o to <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Expectation, and he hoped now that his Friend had given his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o free a vent, he might recollect and bethink him&s;elf of what was convenient to be done; but <HI>Au|relian,</HI> as if he had mu&s;tered up all his Spirits purely to acquit him&s;elf of that pa&s;&s;ionate Harangue, &s;tood mute and in&s;en&s;ible like an Alarum Clock, that had &s;pent all its force in one violent Emotion. <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;hook him by the Arm to rouze him from his Lithargy, when his Lacquey coming into the Room, out of Breath, told him there was a Coach ju&s;t &s;topp'd at the Door, but he did not take time to &s;ee who came in it. <HI>Aurelian</HI> concluded immediately it was his Father in que&s;t of him; and without &s;aying any more to <HI>Hippolito,</HI> than that he was Ruined if di&s;covered, took his Sword and &s;lipp'd down a back pair of Stairs into the Garden, from whence he conveyed him&s;elf into the Street. <HI>Hippolito</HI> had not bethought him&s;elf what to do, be|fore he perceiv'd a Lady come into the Chamber clo&s;e veil'd, and make toward him. At the fir&s;t Appearance of a Woman, his Imagination flattered him with a Thought of <HI>Leonora;</HI> but that was quickly over upon nearer Approach to the Lady, who had much the Advantage in Stature of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s. He very civily acco&s;ted her, and asked, if he were the Per&s;on to whom the Honour

of that Vi&s;it was intended. She &s;aid, her Bu&s;ine&s;s was with <HI>Don Hippolito di Saviolina,</HI> to whom &s;he had Matter of Concern to import, and which required ha&s;te. He had like to have told her, That he was the Man, but by good Chance reflecting upon his Friend's Adventure, who had taken his name, he made An&s;wer, that he believed <HI>Don Hippolito</HI> not far off, and if &s;he had a Moments Patience he would enquire for him.</P>
<P>He went out, leaving the Lady in the Room, and made &s;earch all round the Hou&s;e and Garden for <HI>Aurelian,</HI> but to no purpo&s;e. The Lady impatient of his long &s;tay took a Pen and Ink and &s;ome Paper which &s;he found upon the Table, and had ju&s;t made an End of her Letter, when hearing a Noi&s;e of more than one coming up Stairs, &s;he concluded his Friend had found him, and that her Letter would be to no purpo&s;e, &s;o tore it in peices, which &s;he repented; when turning about, &s;he found her Mi&s;take, and beheld <HI>Don Fabio</HI> and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Viterbo</HI> ju&s;t entring at the Door. She gave a Shriek at the Surprize of their Ap|pearance, which much troubled the Old Gentlemen, and made them retire in Con|fu&s;ion for putting a Gentlewoman into &s;uch a Fright. The Marque&s;s thinking they had been misinformed, or had mi&s;taken the Lodg|ings, came forward again, and made an A|pology to the Lady for their Errour; but &s;he making no reply, walk'd directly by him down Stairs and went into her Coach,
<PB N="57" REF="67">
which hurried her away as &s;peedily as the Hor|&s;es were able to draw.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dons</HI> were at a lo&s;s what to think, when, <HI>Hippolito</HI> coming into the Room to give the Lady an Account of his Errant, was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed to find &s;he was departed, and had left Two Old Signiors in her &s;tead. He knew <HI>Don Fabio</HI>'s Face, for <HI>Aurelian</HI> had &s;hewn him his Father at the Tilting; but being confident he was not known to him, he ventur'd to ask him concerning the Lady whom ju&s;t now he had left in that Chamber. <HI>Don Fabio</HI> told him, &s;he was ju&s;t gone down, and doubt|ed they had been Guilty of a Mi&s;take, in com|ing to enquire for a Couple of Gentlemen whom they were informed were Lodged in that Hou&s;e; he begg'd his Pardon if he had any Relation to that Lady, and de&s;ired to know if he could give them any Account of the Per&s;ons they &s;ought for. <HI>Hippolito</HI> made an|&s;wer, He was a Stranger in the Place, and only a Servant to that Lady whom they had di|&s;turb'd, and whom he mu&s;t go and &s;eek out. And in this Perplexity he left them, going again in Search of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> to inform him of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Old Gentlemen at la&s;t meeting with a Servant of the Hou&s;e, were directed to Signior <HI>Claudio</HI>'s Chamber, where they were no &s;ooner entered but <HI>Aurelian</HI> came into the Hou&s;e. A Servant who had skulk'd for him by <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Order, followed him up into the
<PB N="58" REF="68">
Chamber, and told him who was with <HI>Claudio</HI> then making Enquiry for him. He thought that to be no Place for him, &s;ince <HI>Claudio</HI> mu&s;t needs di&s;cover all the Truth to his Father; wherefore he left Directions with the Ser|vant, where <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;hould meet him in the Morning. As he was going out of the Room he e&s;pied the torn Paper, which the Lady had thrown upon the Floor: The fir&s;t piece he took up had <HI>Incognita</HI> written upon it; the &s;ight of which &s;o Alarm'd him, he &s;carce knew what he was about; but hearing a Noi&s;e of a Door opening over Head, with as much Care as was con&s;i&s;tent with the ha&s;te he was then in, he gathered up the &s;cattered pieces of Paper, and betook him&s;elf to a Ramble.</P>
<P>Coming by a Light which hung at the Cor|ner of a Street, he join'd the torn Papers and collected thus much, that his <HI>Incognita</HI> had Written the Note, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired him (if there were any reality in what he pre|tended to her) to meet her at Twelve a Clock that Night at a Convent Gate; but unluckily the Bit of Paper which &s;hould have mentioned what Convent, was broken off and lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Here was a large Subject for <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion, which he did not &s;pare to pour forth in Abundance of Cur&s;es on his Stars. So earne&s;t was he in the Contemplation of his Misfortunes, that he walk'd on unwittingly; till at length a Silence (and &s;uch as was on|ly to be found in that part of the Town,
<PB N="59" REF="69">
whither his unguided Steps had carried him) &s;urpriz'd his Attention. I &s;ay, a profound Si|lence rouzed him from his Thought; and a clap of Thunder could have done no more.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible this at &s;ome time or other may happen to be read by &s;ome mali|cious or Ignorant Per&s;on, (no Reflection upon the pre&s;ent Reader) who will not ad|mit, or does not under&s;tand that Silence &s;hould make a Man &s;tart; and have the &s;ame Effect, in provoking his Attention, with its oppo&s;ite Noi&s;e; I will illu&s;trate this Matter, to &s;uch a diminutive Critick, by a Parallel In&s;tance of Light; which though it does chiefly entertain the Eyes, and is indeed the prime Object of the Sight, yet &s;hould it im|mediately cea&s;e, to have a Man left in the Dark by a &s;uddain deficiency of it, would make him &s;tare with his Eyes, and though he could not &s;ee, endeavour to look about him. Why ju&s;t thus did it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">are with our Adven|turer; who &s;eeming to have wandred both into the Dominions of Silence and of Night, began to have &s;ome tender for his own Safe|ty, and would willingly have groped his Way back again; when he heard a Voice, as from a Per&s;on who&s;e Breath had been &s;topp'd by &s;ome forcible Oppre&s;&s;ion, and ju&s;t then, by a violent Effort, was broke through the Re&s;traint.&mdash;'Yet&mdash;Yet&mdash;(again reply'd the Voice, &s;till &s;truggling for Air) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Forbear&mdash;and I'll forgive what's pa&s;t&mdash;I have done nothing yet that needs a Pardon,

(&s;ays another) and what is to come, will admit of none.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Per&s;on who &s;eemed to be the Op|pre&s;&s;ed, made &s;everal Attempts to &s;peak, but they were only inarticulate Sounds, being all interrupted and choaked in their Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> was &s;ufficiently a&s;toni&s;h'd, and would have crept nearer to the Place whence he gue&s;&s;ed the Voice to come; but he was got among the Ruins of an Old Mona|&s;tery, and could not &s;tir &s;o &s;ilently, but &s;ome loo&s;e Stones he met with made a rum|bling. The Noi&s;e alarm'd both Parties; and as it gave Comfort to the one, it &s;o Terrified the t'other, that he could not hinder the Oppre&s;&s;ed from calling for help. <HI>Aurelian</HI> fancy'd it was a Womans Voice, and immedi|ately drawing his Sword, demanded what was the Matter; he was an&s;wered with the Appear|ance of a Man, who had opened a Dark Lan|thorn which he had by him, and came to|ward him with a Pi&s;tol in his Hand ready cock'd.</P>
<P><HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;eeing the irre&s;i&s;table advantage his Adver&s;ary had over him, would fain have retired; and, by the greate&s;t Providence in the World, going backwards fell down over &s;ome loo&s;e Stones that lay in his Way, ju&s;t in that In&s;tant of Time when the Villain fired his Pi&s;tol, who &s;eeing him fall, concluded he had Shot him. The Crys of the afflicted Per&s;on were redoubled at the Tragical Sight, which made the Murderer, drawing a Poniard,
<PB N="61" REF="71">
to threaten him, that the next Murmur &s;hould be his la&s;t. <HI>Aurelian,</HI> who was &s;carce a&s;&s;ured that he was unhurt, got &s;oftly up; and coming near enough to perceive the Vio|lence that was u&s;ed to &s;top the Injured Man's Mouth; (for now he &s;aw plainly it was a Man) cry'd out,&mdash;Turn, Villain, and look upon thy Death.&mdash;The Fellow ama|zed at the Voice, turn'd about to have &s;natch'd up the Lanthorn from the Ground; either to have given Light only to him&s;elf, or to have put out the Candle, that he might have made his E&s;cape; but which of the Two he de&s;igned, no Body could tell but him&s;elf: And if the Reader have a Curio&s;ity to know, he mu&s;t blame <HI>Aurelian;</HI> who think|ing there could be no foul Play offered to &s;uch a Villian, ran him immediately through the Heart, &s;o that he drop'd down Dead at his Feet, without &s;peaking a Word. He would have &s;een who the Per&s;on was he had thus happily delivered, but the Dead Body had fallen upon the Lanthorn, which put out the Candle: However, coming up toward him, he ask'd him how he did, and bid him be of good Heart; he was an&s;wered with nothing but Prayers, Ble&s;&s;ings and Thanks, called a Thou&s;and Deliverers, good Genius's, and Guardian Angels. And the Re&s;cued would certainly have gone upon his Knees to have wor&s;hipped him, had he not been bound Hand and Foot; which <HI>Aurelian</HI> under&s;tand|ing, groped for the Knots, and either untied

them or cut them a&s;under; but 'tis more pro|bable the latter, becau&s;e more expeditious.</P>
<P>They took little heed what became of the Body which they left behind them, and <HI>Aurelian</HI> was conducted from out the Ruins by the Hand of him he had delivered, By a faint light i&s;&s;uing from the ju&s;t ri&s;ing Moon, he could di&s;cern that it was a Youth; but com|ing into a more frequented part of the Town, where &s;everal Lights were hung out, he was amaz'd at the extream Beauty which appeared in his Face, though a little pale and di&s;ordered with his late fright. <HI>Aurelian</HI> long|ed to hear the Story of &s;o odd an adventure, and entreated his Charge to tell it him by the way; but he de&s;ired him to forbear till they were come into &s;ome Hou&s;e or other, where he might re&s;t and recover his tired Spirits, for yet he was &s;o faint he was unable to look up. <HI>Aurelian</HI> thought the&s;e la&s;t words were deliveed in a Voice, who&s;e accent was not new to him. That thought made him look earne&s;tly in the Youth's Face, which he now was &s;ure he had &s;omewhere &s;een before, and thereupon asked him if he had never been at <HI>Siena?</HI> That Que&s;tion made the young Gentleman look up, and &s;ome|thing of a Joy appeared in his Counte|nance, which yet he endeavour'd to &s;mother; &s;o praying <HI>Aurelian</HI> to conduct him to his Lodg|ing, he promi&s;ed him that as &s;oon as they &s;hould come thither, he would acquaint him with any thing he de&s;ired to know. <HI>Aurelian</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="73">
would rather have gone any where el&s;e than to his own Lodging; but being &s;o very late he was at a lo&s;s, and &s;o forced to be con|tented.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were come into his Cham|ber, and that Lights were brought them and the Servant di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the palene&s;s which &s;o vi&s;ibly before had u&s;urped the &s;weet Counte|nance of the afflicted Youth vani&s;hed, and gave place to a more lively Flood of Crim&s;on, which with a mode&s;t heat glow'd fre&s;hly on his Cheeks. <HI>Aurelian</HI> waited with a plea&s;ing Admiration the di&s;covery promi&s;ed him, when the Youth &s;till &s;truggling with his Re&s;olution, with a timorous ha&s;te, pulled off a Peruke which had concealed the mo&s;t beautiful a|bundance of Hair that ever graced one Fe|male Head; tho&s;e di&s;hevelled &s;preading Tre&s;&s;es, as at fir&s;t they made a di&s;covery of, &s;o at la&s;t they &s;erved for a veil to the mode&s;t lovely blu&s;hes of the fair <HI>Incognita;</HI> for &s;he it was and none other.

At that (as <HI>Aurelian</HI> tells the Story) a Sigh diffu&s;ed a mournful &s;weetne&s;s through the Air, and liquid grief fell gently from her Eyes, tri|umphant &s;adne&s;s &s;at upon her Brow, and e|ven &s;orrow &s;eem'd delighted with the Con|que&s;t he had made.

In the mean time, it may be convenient to enquire what became of <HI>Hippolito.</HI> He wan|dred much in pur&s;uit of <HI>Aurelian,</HI> though <HI>Leo|nora</HI> equally took up his Thoughts; He was re|flecting upon the oddne&s;s and extravagance of his Circum&s;tances, the Continuation of which had doubtle&s;s created in him a great unea|&s;ine&s;s, when it was interrupted with the noi&s;e of opening the Gates of the Convent of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> whither he was arrived &s;ooner than he thought for, being the place <HI>Aurelian</HI> had appointed by the Lacquey to meet him in.

He found the Religious Men all up, and Tapers lighting every where: At la&s;t he follow'd a Friar who was going into the Garden, and asking him the cau&s;e of the&s;e Preparations, he was an|&s;wer'd, That they were entreated to pray for the Soul of a Cavalier, who was ju&s;t departing or departed this Life, and whom upon farther talk with him, he found to be the &s;ame <HI>Lo|renzo</HI> &s;o often mentioned. <HI>Don Mario,</HI> it &s;eems, Uncle to <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and Father to <HI>Leonora,</HI> had a private Door out of the Garden belonging to his Hou&s;e into that of the Convent, which Door this Father was now a going to open, that he and his Family might come and offer up their Orai&s;ons for the Soul of their Kin&s;man.

<P>He went into <HI>Don Mario</HI>'s Garden, and walk'd round with much Caution and Circum|&s;pection; for the Moon was then about to ri&s;e, and had already diffu&s;ed a glimmering Light, &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h a Man from a Tree.

The Con&s;i|deration of that, together with the Obligation he lay under to the Mu&s;es, for &s;heltering him al&s;o with &s;o large a Crown of Bays, had like to have &s;et him a Rhyming.</P>
<P>He was, to tell the Truth, naturally ad|dicted to <HI>Madrigal,</HI> and we &s;hould undoubt|edly have had a &s;mall de&s;ert of Numbers to have pick'd and Criticiz'd upon, had he not been interrupted ju&s;t upon his Delivery; nay, after the Preliminary Sigh had made Way for his Utterance. But &s;o was his Fortune, <HI>Don Mario</HI> was coming towards the Door at that very nick of Time, where he met with a Prie&s;t ju&s;t out of Breath, who told him that <HI>Lorenzo</HI> was ju&s;t breathing his la&s;t, and de&s;i|red to know if he would come and take his final Leave before they were to admini&s;ter the Extream Unction. <HI>Don Mario,</HI> who had been at &s;ome Difference with his Nephew, now thought it his Duty to be reconciled to him; &s;o calling to <HI>Leonora,</HI> who was coming after him, he bid her go to her Devotions in the Chappel, and told her where he was go|ing.</P>
<P>He went on with the Prie&s;t, while <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;aw <HI>Leonora</HI> come forward, only accompani|ed by her Woman. She was in an undre&s;s, and by rea&s;on of a Melancholy vi&s;ible in her
<PB N="89" REF="83">
Face, more Carele&s;s than u&s;ual in her At|tire, which he thought added as much as was po&s;&s;ible to the abundance of her Charms. He had not much Time to Contemplate this Beauteous Vi&s;ion, for &s;he &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed into the Garden of the Convent, leaving him Confound|ed with Love, Admiration, Joy, Hope, Fear, and all the Train of Pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;eize up|on Men in his Condition, all at once. He was &s;o teazed with this Variety of Torment, that he never mi&s;&s;ed the Two Hours tha thad &s;lipped away during his Automachy and Inte&s;tine Conflict. <HI>Leonora</HI>'s Return &s;ettled his Spi|rits, at lea&s;t united them, and he had now no other Thought but how he &s;hould pre&s;ent him|&s;elf before her. When &s;he calling her Wo|man, bid her bolt the Garden Door on the In|&s;ide, that &s;he might not be Surpriz'd by her Father, if he returned through the Convent; which done, &s;he ordered her to bring down her Lute, and leave her to her &s;elf in the Garden.</P>
<P>All this <HI>Hippolito</HI> &s;aw and heard to his inex|pre&s;&s;ible Content, yet had he much to do to &s;mother his Joy, and hinder it from taking a Vent, which would have ruined the only Opportunity of his Life. <HI>Leonora</HI> withdrew into an Arbour &s;o near him, that he could di&s;tinctly hear her if &s;he Played or Sung: Having tuned her Lute, with a Voice &s;oft as the Breath of Angels, &s;he &s;ung to it this fol|lowing Air:</P>

<P>The Song ended grieved <HI>Hippolito</HI> that it was &s;o &s;oon ended; and in the Ex&s;tacy he was then rapt, I believe he would have been &s;atisfied to have expired with it. He
<PB N="91" REF="85">
could not help Flattering him&s;elf, (though at the &s;ame Time he checked his own Va|nity) that he was the Per&s;on meant in the Song. While he was indulging which thought, to his happy A&s;toni&s;hment, he heard it encou|raged by the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Unhappy <HI>Leonora</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) how is thy poor unwary Heart mi&s;led? Whither am I come?

<P><HI>Hippolito</HI> could hear no more, he had not Room for half his Tran&s;port. When <HI>Leo|nora</HI> perceived a Man coming toward her, &s;he fell a trembling, and could not &s;peak. <HI>Hip|polito</HI> approached with Reverence, as to a Sacred Shrine; when coming near enough to &s;ee her Con&s;ternation, he fell upon his Knees.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Behold, O Adored <HI>Leonora</HI> (&s;aid he) your ravi&s;hed <HI>Aurelian,</HI> behold at your Feet the Happie&s;t of Men, be not di&s;turbed at my Appearance, but think that Heaven conducted me to hear my Bli&s;s pronoun|ced by that dear Mouth alone, who&s;e breath could fill me with new Life.</Q></P>
<P>Here he would have come nearer, but <HI>Leonora</HI> (&s;carce come to her &s;elf) was get|ting up in ha&s;te to have gone away: He catch'd her Hand, and with all the Endear|ments of Love and Tran&s;port pre&s;&s;ed her &s;tay; &s;he was a long time in great Confu&s;ion, at la&s;t, with many Blu&s;hes, &s;he entreated him to let her go where &s;he might hide her Guilty Head, and not expo&s;e her &s;hame before his Eyes,
<PB N="93" REF="87">
&s;ince his Ears had been &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es of her Crime.</P>
<P>He begg'd pardon for his Treachery in over|hearing, and confe&s;&s;ed it to be a Crime he had now repeated. With a Thou&s;and Sub|mi&s;&s;ions, Entreaties, Prayers, Prai&s;es, Ble&s;|&s;ings, and pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions he wrought upon her to &s;tay and hear him. Here <HI>Hippolito</HI> made u&s;e of his Rhetorick, and it prov'd prevailing: 'Twere tedious to tell the many ingenious Arguments he u&s;ed, with all her Nice Di&s;tinctions and Objections. In &s;hort, he convinced her of his Pa&s;&s;ion, repre&s;ented to her the nece&s;&s;ity they were under, of being &s;peedy in their Re&s;olves: That his Father (for &s;till he was <HI>Aurelian</HI>) would undoubtedly find him in the Morning, and then it would be too late to Repent. She on the other Hand, knew it was in vain to deny a Pa&s;&s;ion, which he had heard her &s;o frankly own; (and no doubt was very glad it was pa&s;t and done;) be&s;ides apprehending the Danger of delay, and having &s;ome little Jealou&s;ies and Fears of what Effect might be produced between the Commands of his Father and the Beauties of <HI>Juliana;</HI> after &s;ome decent Denials, &s;he con&s;ented to be Conducted by him through the Garden into the Con|vent, where &s;he would prevail with her Confe&s;&s;or to Marry them. He was a &s;cru|pulous Old Father whom they had to deal withal, in&s;omuch that ere they had per|&s;waded him, <HI>Don Mario</HI> was returned by the
<PB N="94" REF="88">
Way of his own Hou&s;e, where mi&s;&s;ing his Daughter, and her Woman not being able to give any farther Account of her, than that &s;he left her in the Garden, he con|cluded &s;he was gone again to her Devotions, and indeed he found her in the Chappel upon her Knees with <HI>Hippolito</HI> in her Hand, receiving the Father's Benediction upon Con|clu&s;ion of the Ceremony.</P>
<P>It would have asked a very skilful Hand, to have depicted to the Life the Faces of tho&s;e Three Per&s;ons at <HI>Don Mario</HI>'s Ap|pearance. He that has &s;een &s;ome admi|rable Piece of Tran&s;mutation by a Gorgon's Head, may form to him&s;elf the mo&s;t proba|ble Idea of the Prototype. The Old Gentle|man was him&s;elf in a &s;ort of a Wood, to find his Daughter, with a Young Fellow and a Prie&s;t, but as yet he did not know the Wor&s;t, till <HI>Hippolito</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> came, and kneeling at his Feet, begg'd his Forgivene&s;s and Ble&s;&s;ing as his Son and Daughter. <HI>Don Mario,</HI> in&s;tead of that, fell into a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and would undoubtedly have com|mitted &s;ome extravagant Action, had he not been re&s;trained, more by the Sanctity of the Place, than the Per&s;wa&s;ions of all the Re|ligious, who were now come about him. <HI>Leonora</HI> &s;tirr'd not off her Knees all this time, but continued begging of him that he would hear her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah! Ungrateful and Undutiful Wretch (cry'd he) how ha&s;t thou requited all my
<PB N="95" REF="89">
Care and Tenderne&s;s of thee? Now when I might have expected &s;ome return of Com|fort, to throw thy &s;elf away upon an un|known Per&s;on, and, for ought I know, a Villain; to me I'm &s;ure he is a Villain, who has robb'd me of my Trea&s;ure, my Darling Joy, and all the future Happine&s;s of my Life prevented. Go&mdash;go, thou now to be forgotten <HI>Leonora,</HI> go and enjoy thy unpro&s;perous Choice; you who wanted not a Father's Coun&s;el cannot need, or el&s;e will &s;light his Ble&s;&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t Words were &s;poken with &s;o much Pa&s;&s;ion and feeling Concern, that <HI>Leonora,</HI> moved with Exce&s;s of Grief, fainted at his Feet, ju&s;t as &s;he had caught hold to Embrace his Knees. The Old Man would have &s;hook her off, but Compa&s;&s;ion and Fatherly Af|fection came upon him in the mid&s;t of his Re&s;olve, and melted him into Tears; he Embraced his Daughter in his Arms, and wept over her, while they endeavoured to re&s;tore her Sen&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Hippolito</HI> was in &s;uch Concern he could not &s;peak, but was bu&s;ily employed in rub|bing and chafing her Temples; when &s;he opening her Eyes laid hold of his Arm, and cry'd out&mdash;<HI>Oh my</HI> Aurelian&mdash;<HI>how unhappy have you made me!</HI> With that &s;he had again like to have fainted away, but he &s;hook her in his Arms, and begg'd <HI>Don Mario</HI> to have &s;ome pity on his Daughter, &s;ince by his Severity &s;he was reduced to that
<PB N="96" REF="90">
Condition. The Old Man hearing his Daugh|ter name <HI>Aurelian,</HI> was a little revived, and began to hope Things were in a pretty good Condition, he was per&s;waded to comfort her; and having brought her wholly to her &s;elf, was content to hear her Excu&s;e, and in a little time was &s;o far wrought upon as to beg <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Pardon for the Ill Opinion he had conceived of him, and not long after gave his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Night was &s;pent in this Conflict, and it was now clear Day, when <HI>Don Mario</HI> Con|ducting his new Son and Daughter through the Garden, was met by &s;ome Servants of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Viterbo,</HI> who had been enquiring for <HI>Donna Leonora,</HI> to know if <HI>Juliana</HI> had lately been with her; for that &s;he was mi&s;&s;ing from her Father's Hou&s;e, and no conjectures could be made of what might become of her. <HI>Don Mario</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> were &s;urprized at the News, for he knew well enough of the Match that was de&s;ign'd for <HI>Juliana;</HI> and having enquired where the Marque&s;s was, it was told him, That he was gone with <HI>Don Fabio</HI> and <HI>Fabritio</HI> towards <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s Lodg|ings. <HI>Don Mario</HI> having a&s;&s;ured the Servants that <HI>Juliana</HI> had not been there, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and advi&s;ed with his Son and Daugh|ter how they &s;hould undeceive the Marque&s;s and <HI>Don Fabio</HI> in their Expectations of <HI>Aure|lian. Hippolito</HI> could oftentimes &s;carce for|bear &s;miling at the old Man's Contrivances who was mo&s;t deceiv'd him&s;elf; he at length
<PB N="97" REF="91">
advi&s;ed them to go all down together to his Lodging, where he could pre&s;ent him&s;elf be|fore his Father, and ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s to him the truth, and he did not que&s;tion his ap|proving of his Choice.</P>
<P>This was agreed to, and the Coach made ready. While they were upon their way, <HI>Hippolito</HI> pray'd heartily that his Friend <HI>Au|relian</HI> might be at the Lodging, to &s;atisfie <HI>Don Mario</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> of his Circum&s;tances and Quality, when he &s;hould be obliged to di&s;cover him&s;elf. His Petitions were granted; for <HI>Don Fabio</HI> had be&s;et the Hou&s;e long before his Son was up, or <HI>Incognita</HI> awake.</P>
<P>Upon the Arrival of <HI>Don Mario</HI> and <HI>Hippoli|to,</HI> they heard a great Noi&s;e and Hubbub above Stairs, which <HI>Don Mario</HI> concluded was occa&s;i|oned by their not finding <HI>Aurelian,</HI> whom he thought he could give the be&s;t account of: So that it was not in <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s power to di&s;&s;wade him from going up before to prepare his Fa|ther to receive and forgive him. While <HI>Hip|polito</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> were left in the Coach at the Door, he made him&s;elf known to her, and begg'd her pardon a thou&s;and times for con|tinuing the Deceit. She was under &s;ome con|cern at fir&s;t to find &s;he was &s;till mi&s;taken; but his Behaviour, and the Rea&s;ons he gave, &s;oon reconciled him to her; his Per&s;on was altoge|ther as agreeable, his E&s;tate and Quality not at all inferior to <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s; in the mean time, the true <HI>Aurelian</HI> who had &s;een his Father, begg'd leave of him to withdraw for a moment;
<PB N="98" REF="92">
in which time he went into the Cham|ber where his <HI>Incognita</HI> was dre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf, by his de&s;ign, in Woman's Apparel, while he was con&s;ulting with her how they &s;hould break the matter to his Father; it happened that <HI>Don Mario</HI> came up Stairs where the Mar|que&s;s and <HI>Don Fabio</HI> were; they undoubtedly concluded him Mad, to hear him making Apo|logies and Excu&s;es for <HI>Aurelian,</HI> whom he told them if they would promi&s;e to forgive, he would pre&s;ent before them immediately. The Marque&s;s asked him if his Daughter had lain with <HI>Leonora</HI> that Night; he an&s;wered him with another que&s;tion in behalf of <HI>Aurelian.</HI> In &s;hort, they could not under&s;tand one ano|ther, but each thought 'tother be&s;ide him&s;elf, <HI>Don Mario</HI> was &s;o concern'd that they would not believe him, that he ran down Stairs and came to the Door out of Breath, de&s;iring <HI>Hippolito</HI> that he would come into the Hou&s;e quickly, for that he could not per&s;wade his Father but that he had already &s;een and &s;poke to him. <HI>Hippolito</HI> by that under&s;tood that <HI>Aurelian</HI> was in the Hou&s;e; &s;o taking <HI>Leonora</HI> by the Hand, he followed <HI>Don Mario,</HI> who led him up into the Dining-Room, where they found <HI>Aurelian</HI> upon his Knees, begging his Father to forgive him, that he could not agree to the Choice he had made for him, &s;ince he had already di&s;po&s;ed of him&s;elf, and that before he under&s;tood the de&s;igns he had for him, which was the rea&s;on that he had hi|therto concealed him&s;elf. <HI>Don Fabio</HI> knew not
<PB N="99" REF="93">
how to an&s;wer him, but look'd upon the Mar|que&s;s, and the Marque&s;s upon him, as if the Cement had been cool'd which was to have united their Families.</P>
<P>All was &s;ilent, and <HI>Don Mario</HI> for his part took it to be all Conjuration; he was com|ing forward to pre&s;ent <HI>Hippolito</HI> to them, when <HI>Aurelian</HI> &s;pying his Friend, &s;tarted from his Knees and ran to embrace him&mdash;My dear <HI>Hippolito</HI> (&s;aid he) what happy chance has brought you hither, ju&s;t at my Nece&s;&s;ity? <HI>Hippolito</HI> pointed to <HI>Don Mario</HI> and <HI>Leonora,</HI> and told him upon what terms he came. <HI>Don Mario</HI> was ready to run mad, hearing him called <HI>Hippolito,</HI> and went again to examine his Daughter. While &s;he was informing him of the truth, the Marque&s;s's Servants returned with the melancholy News that his Daughter was no where to be found. While the Mar|que&s;s and <HI>Don Fabritio</HI> were wondering at, and lamenting the Misfortune of her lo&s;s, <HI>Hip|polito</HI> came towards <HI>Don Fabio,</HI> and interceed|ed for his Son, &s;ince the Lady perhaps had withdrawn her &s;elf out of an Aver&s;ion to the Match. <HI>Don Fabio,</HI> though very much incens'd, yet forgot not the Re&s;pect due to <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s Quality; and by his per&s;wa&s;ion &s;poke to <HI>Au|relian,</HI> though with a &s;tern Look and Angry Voice, and asked him where he had di&s;po&s;ed the cau&s;e of his Di&s;obedience, if he were worthy to &s;ee her or no? <HI>Aurelian</HI> made An|&s;wer, That he de&s;ired no more than for him to &s;ee her; and he did not doubt a Con&s;equence
<PB N="100" REF="94">
of his Approbation and Forgivene&s;s&mdash;Well (&s;aid <HI>Don Fabio</HI>) you are very conceited of your own Di&s;cretion, let us &s;ee this Rari|ty. While <HI>Aurelian</HI> was gone in for <HI>Incogni|ta,</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Viterbo</HI> and <HI>Don Fabritio</HI> were taking their leaves in great di&s;order for their lo&s;s and di&s;appointment; but <HI>Don Fabio</HI> entreated their &s;tay a moment longer till the return of his Son. <HI>Aurelian</HI> led <HI>Incognita</HI> into the Room veil'd, who &s;eeing &s;ome Company there which he had not told her of, would have gone back again. But <HI>Don Fabio</HI> came bluntly forwards, and ere &s;he was aware, lif|ted up her Veil and beheld the Fair <HI>Incognita,</HI> differing nothing from <HI>Juliana,</HI> but in her Name. This di&s;covery was &s;o extreamly &s;urprizing and welcome, that either Joy or A|mazement had tied up the Tongues of the whole Company. <HI>Aurelian</HI> here was mo&s;t at a lo&s;s, for he knew not of his Happine&s;s; and that which all along prevented <HI>Juliana</HI>'s con|fe&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to him, was her knowing <HI>Hip|polito</HI> (for whom &s;he took him) to be <HI>Aure|lian</HI>'s Friend, and &s;he feared if he had known her, that he would never have con&s;ented to have depriv'd him of her. <HI>Juliana</HI> was the fir&s;t that &s;poke, falling upon her Knees to her Father, who was not enough him&s;elf to take her up. <HI>Don Fabio</HI> ran to her, and a|waken'd the Marque&s;s, who then embraced her, but could not yet &s;peak. <HI>Fabritio</HI> and <HI>Le|onora</HI> &s;trove who &s;hould fir&s;t take her in their Arms; for <HI>Aurelian</HI> he was out of his Wits
<PB N="101" REF="95">
for Joy, and <HI>Juliana</HI> was not much behind him, to &s;ee how happily their Loves and Duties were Reconcil'd. <HI>Don Fabio</HI> embraced his Son and forgave him. The Marque&s;s and <HI>Fabri|tio</HI> gave <HI>Juliana</HI> into his Hands, he received the Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Knees; all were over|joy'd, and <HI>Don Mario</HI> not a little proud at the di&s;covery of his Son-in-Law, whom <HI>Aurelian</HI> did not fail to &s;et forth with all the ardent Zeal and Eloquence of Friend&s;hip. <HI>Juliana</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> had plea&s;ant Di&s;cour&s;e about their unknown and mi&s;taken Rival&s;hip, and it was the Subject of a great deal of Mirth to hear <HI>Juliana</HI> relate the &s;everal Contrivances which &s;he had to avoid <HI>Aurelian</HI> for the &s;ake of <HI>Hip|polito.</HI></P>
<P>Having diverted them&s;elves with many Re|marks upon the plea&s;ing &s;urprize, they all thought it proper to attend upon the Great Duke that Morning at the Palace, and to acquaint him with the Novelty of what had pa&s;s'd; while, by the way, the two Young Couple entertained the Company with the Relation of &s;everal Particulars of their Three Days Adventures.</P>
