<HEAD>CHAP. I. A NEW AND BOLD PROJECT CONCEIVED AND EXE|CUTED BY WAKEFIELD. THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING PRINCIPLES AGREE WITH PRACTICE DISCUSSED. FAIR PROMISES ON THE PART OF AN OLD OFFENDER, THE HOPES THEY EXCITE AND THE FEARS THAT ACCOMPANY THEM.</HEAD>
<P>THE affair of the pamphlet being re|moved from my mind, I had lei&s;ure to attend to the other difficulty that had lately cro&s;&s;ed me; by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which Wakefield had illegally taken of effects which he a&s;&s;erted to be his, in the double right of being heir to his uncle and the hu&s;band of my mother, but which, if my information were true, ap|pertained to me.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed I communi|cated all my thoughts to friends like Evelyn, Wilmot, and Turl; and en|deavoured to profit by their advice.</P>
<P>Law had lately undergone a &s;erious examination from us all; and it was then the general opinion among us that, though it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid ap|pealing to it on &s;ome occa&s;ions, yet nothing but the mo&s;t urgent ca&s;es could ju&s;tify &s;uch appeals. Enquiries that were to be regulated, not by a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice but by the di&s;putatious temper of men who&s;e trade it was to deceive, and by &s;tatutes and precedents which they might or might not remember, and which, though they might equivocally and partially apply in &s;ome points, in others had no re&s;emblance, &s;uch enqui|ries ought not lightly to be in&s;tituted. Nei|ther ought the habitual vices which they engender, both in lawyer and client, nor the mi&s;eries they inflict, upon the latter
<PB N="3" REF="5">
in particular, and by their con&s;equences upon all &s;ociety, to be promoted.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation at the tavern, when I dined and &s;pent the afternoon with the fal&s;e Belmont, this &s;ub|ject among others had occurred. Having told him that I had quitted all thoughts of the law, he enquired into my motives; and, being full of the &s;ubject and zealous to detail its whole iniquity, I not only urged the rea&s;ons that mo&s;t militate again&s;t it both in principle and practice, but, in the warmth of argument, declared that I doubted whether any man could bring an action again&s;t another without being guilty of inju&s;tice. I con&s;idered crime and error as the &s;ame. The &s;truc|ture of law I argued was erroneous, therefore criminal; and I prote&s;ted again&s;t the attempting to redre&s;s a wrong, already committed, by the commi&s;&s;ion of more wrong.</P>
<P>The death of Thornby happened im|mediately
<PB N="4" REF="6">
after this conver&s;ation took place; and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a man like my young but inventive father-in-law could forget, or fail in endeavour|ing to profit by, &s;uch an incident.</P>
<P>One morning while at breakfa&s;t, I re|ceived a note from him, &s;igned Belmont; in which he reque&s;ted me again to dine and &s;pend the afternoon with him: al|leging that an event had taken place in which he was deeply intere&s;ted: adding that he had been lately led to reflect on many of the remarks I had made; and that he hoped the period was come when he &s;hould be able to change the &s;y&s;tem to which I was &s;o inimical, for one that better agreed with my own &s;entiments: but that my advice was particularly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The note gave me plea&s;ure. That a man with &s;uch powers of mind, and charms of conver&s;ation, &s;hould have only a chance of changing, from what he was
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to what I hoped, was delightful. And that he &s;hould call upon me for advice, at &s;uch a juncture, was flattering.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered that an engagement already formed prevented me from meeting him, on that day: but I appointed the next morning for an interview. Dining I de|clined; as a hint that I di&s;approved the attempt he had made to entrap me.</P>
<P>The engagement I had was to accom|pany Lady Bray, to one of the families acquainted with the Mowbrays; and where it was expected we &s;hould meet Olivia, and her aunt. This expectation, which kept my &s;pirits in a flutter the whole day and increa&s;ed to alarm and dread in the evening, was di&s;appointed. Whether from any real or a pretended accident on the part of the aunt, who &s;ent an apology, was more than I had an opportunity to know.</P>
<P>I kept my appointment, on the follow|ing morning; and was rather &s;urpri&s;ed,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
when we met, at perceiving that the &s;till pretended Belmont, like my&s;elf, was in deep mourning. I began to make en|quiries, to which he gave &s;hort an&s;wers; and, turning the interrogatories upon me, a&s;ked which of my relations was dead?"</P>
<P>"My mother."</P>
<P>"Oh: I remember. Mrs. Wakefield. Are you &s;till as angry with her hu&s;band as ever?"</P>
<P>"I really cannot tell. Though I have what mo&s;t people would think much greater cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"Indeed! What has he done more?"</P>
<P>"Taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property which is mine."</P>
<P>"By what right is it yours?"</P>
<P>"It was bequeathed me by my grand|father; and &s;ince that by his executor."</P>
<P>"The uncle of this Wakefield, I think you told me?"</P>
<P>"Yes. A lawyer. One Thornby; who was induced by death-bed terrors to
<PB N="7" REF="9">
re&s;tore what he had robbed me of while living."</P>
<P>"That is, he lived a knave, and died a fool and a fanatic."</P>
<P>"I &s;u&s;pect that he died as he had lived. Knavery and fanatici&s;m are frequently coupled."</P>
<P>"And how do you intend to proceed?"</P>
<P>"I do not know. I have not yet con|&s;ulted a lawyer."</P>
<P>"Con&s;ulted a lawyer? You &s;urpri&s;e me! When la&s;t I &s;aw you, I was half convinced by you that a man cannot ju&s;tly &s;eek redre&s;s at law. Its &s;ources you proved to be corrupt, its powers inade|quate, and its deci&s;ions never accurate; therefore never ju&s;t. This was your lan|guage. You reprobated tho&s;e accom|modating rules by which I endeavoured to obtain happine&s;s; and urged argu|ments that made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon me. Now that &s;elf-intere&s;t gives you an impul&s;e, are your principles become as
<PB N="8" REF="10">
pliant as mine; which you &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly reproved?"</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed, and then replied&mdash;"I imagine you take &s;ome delight in having found an opportunity of retorting upon me; and of laughing at what you &s;till con&s;ider as folly."</P>
<P>"Indeed you mi&s;take. I hope by re|minding you of your own doctrine to in|duce you to put it in practice. The virtue that con&s;i&s;ts only in words is but a vapour."</P>
<P>"Surely you will allow this is an ex|treme if not a doubtful ca&s;e. I do not mean to commence an action, till I have con&s;idered it very &s;eriou&s;ly: but I pre|&s;ume you do not require infallibility of me? Or, if you do, it is what I cannot expect from my&s;elf. I have frequently been led to doubt whether principles the mo&s;t indubitable mu&s;t not bend to the mi&s;takes and in&s;titutions of &s;ociety. This doubt is to me the mo&s;t painful that can
<PB N="9" REF="11">
cro&s;s the mind: but it is one from which I cannot wholly e&s;cape."</P>
<P>"Your tone I find is greatly altered. How &s;trenuous, how firm, how founded, were all your maxims; when la&s;t we met."</P>
<P>"And &s;o, I am per&s;uaded, the maxims of truth will always remain."</P>
<P>"Then why depart from them? Ano|ther of them, which I likewi&s;e recollect to have heard from you, is that the laws which pretend to regulate property, whe|ther by will, entail, or any other de&s;cent, are all unju&s;t: for that effects of all kinds &s;hould be &s;o appropriated as to produce the greate&s;t good."</P>
<P>"I do not &s;ee how that can be denied. But this is &s;trongly to the point in my favour, as I &s;uppo&s;e: for the in&s;titutes of &s;ociety render the application of the prin|ciple impracticable; and therefore I think the property may have a greater chance of being applied to a good purpo&s;e, if
<PB N="10" REF="12">
allotted to me, than if retained by this Wakefield; who&s;e vices are extraordi|nary."</P>
<P>"You believe him to be a man of &s;ome talent?"</P>
<P>"All that know him affirm his under|&s;tanding would be of the fir&s;t order, were it worthily employed."</P>
<P>"Then would it not be a good appli|cation of the property in conte&s;t, if it &s;hould both enable and induce him &s;o to employ his under&s;tanding?"</P>
<P>"Oh, of that there is no hope."</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>How do you know? I believe you have thought the &s;ame of me: but you may chance to be mi&s;taken. And now I will tell you a &s;ecret. I am in the very predicament of this Wakefield. A re|lation is dead, who has left his property away from me: by what right is more than I can di&s;cover; at lea&s;t in the &s;pirit of tho&s;e laws which pretend to regulate &s;uch matters: for their &s;pirit is force.
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Lands wre&s;ted from the helple&s;s they con&s;ign to the robber. I am in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; and doubt whether, even according to your code, I ought to re&s;ign, I cer|tainly ought not according to my own. I will acknowledge to you that I think well of the man who claims the property I withhold. But I cannot think &s;o well of him as of my&s;elf: for I cannot be &s;o well acquainted with his thoughts as with my own. I know my own wants, my own powers, and my own plans. I &s;hould be glad to do him good, but I &s;hould be &s;orry to do my&s;elf ill. You accu&s;e me of having fallen into erroneous habits, of making fal&s;e calculations, and of ta&s;ting plea&s;ures that are dangerous and of &s;hort duration. I have ridiculed your argu|ments: but I have not forgotten them. Neither has the enquiring &s;pirit that is abroad been unknown to or unnoticed by me. Early powers of mind gave me the early means of indulgence. I revelled
<PB N="12" REF="14">
in plea&s;ure, &s;quandered all I could pro|cure, and was led by one &s;ucce&s;sful arti|fice to another, till I became what I can certainly no otherwi&s;e ju&s;tify than by the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of the world. In this I find the rule is for each to &s;eize on all that he can, with &s;afety; and to &s;wallow, hoard, or wa&s;te it at will. I have attempted to profit by vice which I knew not how to avoid. But, if there be a &s;afer road to happine&s;s, I am no idiot: I am as de|&s;irous of pur&s;uing it as you can be. The re&s;pect of the world, the &s;ecurity from pains and penalties, and the approbation of my own heart, are all of them as dear to me as to you. I have thought much, have had much experience, and have the power of comparing facts and &s;en&s;ations as largely perhaps as another.</P>
<P>I will not deny that to trick &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s by its own arts, to laugh at its &s;tu|pidity, and to outwit its contemptible cunning, are practices that have tickled
<PB N="13" REF="15">
my vanity; and have perhaps formed one of my chief &s;ources of plea&s;ure. But habit and plea&s;ure led me to extend &s;uch projects; and to prey upon the well-meaning, and the kind, with almo&s;t as much avidity as on tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character.</P>
<P>However, though I did not want plau&s;ible arguments in my own ju&s;tifica|tion, I cannot affirm that my heart was wholly at ea&s;e. New thoughts have oc|curred, other pro&s;pects have been con|templated, and my di&s;&s;atisfaction has in|crea&s;ed. You cannot but have remarked that, in the cour&s;e of human life, mo&s;t men undergo more than one remarkable change. The &s;ober man becomes a drunkard, the drunkard &s;ober, and the &s;pendthrift &s;ometimes a rational econo|mi&s;t: though perhaps more frequently a mi&s;er.</P>
<P>Yet, though I am di&s;po&s;ed to alter
<PB N="14" REF="16">
my conduct, &s;uppo&s;ing me to po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of bidding defiance to mankind, I have no inclination to &s;ubject my&s;elf to their neglect, their pity, or their &s;corn. Be it want of courage or want of wi&s;dom, I have not an intention to &s;hut my&s;elf out from &s;ociety. If I may be admitted on fair and liberal terms, I am content: but, I hone&s;tly tell you, admitted I will be. I have &s;hut the door of dependency upon my&s;elf were I &s;o inclined. Offices of tru&s;t would not be committed to me. And to live rejected, in poverty and wretchedne&s;s, pointed at and pretended to be de&s;pi&s;ed by the knaves and fools with whom the world is filled, is a condition to which I will never &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, the property of which I have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my&s;elf I am in either ca&s;e determined to u&s;e every effort to keep. If I am &s;uffered to keep it quietly, my pre&s;ent inclinations are what I have been
<PB N="15" REF="17">
de&s;cribing. If contention mu&s;t come, we mu&s;t then have a trial of &s;kill upon the oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem.</P></Q>
<P>I li&s;tened to this di&s;cour&s;e, attentive to every &s;entence, anxious for the next, and agitated by various contradictory emo|tions. I &s;aw the difficulties of the &s;up|po&s;ed ca&s;e; and knew not what to an&s;wer, or what to advi&s;e. That a man like this &s;hould become what he &s;eemed half to promi&s;e was a thought that con&s;oled and expanded the heart. But that it &s;hould depend upon &s;o improbable an event as that of another renouncing a claim, which the law gave him, to property in di&s;pute, was a mo&s;t painful alternative. My &s;en|&s;ations were of hope &s;uddenly kindled, and as &s;uddenly killed.</P>
<P>After waiting &s;ome time without any reply from me, he added "Let us &s;up|po&s;e, Mr. Trevor, a whim&s;ical, or if you plea&s;e a &s;trange, coincidence between the man with whom you have been &s;o angry
<PB N="16" REF="18">
and my&s;elf. I mean Wakefield. What if he felt &s;ome of the &s;ober propen&s;ities toward which I find a kind of a call in my&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"He is not to be tru&s;ted. In him it would be artifice: or at lea&s;t nobody would believe it could be any thing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"Mark now what chance there is, in a world like this, for a man whom it has once deemed criminal to reform. Op|pre&s;&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and pur&s;ued by the good, what re&s;ource has he but to a&s;&s;o|ciate with the wicked?"</P>
<P>"He that, with the faire&s;t &s;eeming and the mo&s;t &s;pecious pretences, affirm|ing time after time that, though he had deceived before, he now was hone&s;t, he that &s;hall yet again and again repeat his acts of infamy cannot complain, if no man &s;hould be willing to tru&s;t his happi|ne&s;s to &s;uch keeping."</P>
<P>"I find what I am to expect from you. The very &s;ame will be &s;aid of me."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">"No: you have not been equally un|principled, and vile."</P>
<P>"The&s;e are coar&s;e or at lea&s;t har&s;h terms. However, I take them to my&s;elf; and affirm that I have."</P>
<P>"How can you make &s;uch an affirma|tion? How do you know?"</P>
<P>"A man may calculate on probabi|lities; and this is a moment in which I do not wi&s;h to conceal the full e&s;timate which I make of my own conduct from you. Being therefore, &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;peaking to the be&s;t of my judgment, as culpable as Wakefield, let my cour&s;e of life hereafter be what it will, I find I am to expect no credit for &s;incerity from you?"</P>
<P>"You do not know Wakefield."</P>
<P>"Neither it &s;eems do you."</P>
<P>"There is &s;omething in your coun|tenance, in your conver&s;ation, and in the free and undi&s;gui&s;ed hone&s;ty even of your vices, that a man like Wakefield cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">"Have you forgotten that, though I can be open and hone&s;t, I can be artful? Do you not remember billiards, hazard, and Bath?"</P>
<P>"Yes: but Wakefield would be in|capable of the qualities of mind which you are now di&s;playing. With you I feel my&s;elf in the company of a man of a perverted but a magnanimous &s;pirit. With all your faults, I could hug you to my heart. But Wakefield! who made women and men alike his prey; to who&s;e devili&s;h arts the virtue and happine&s;s of an amiable, I may &s;ay a charming, woman were &s;acrificed; and the life of one of the fir&s;t of mankind was endangered; that he &s;hould re&s;emble you, and e&s;pecially that he &s;hould re&s;emble you with your pre&s;ent inclinations, oh! would that were po&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"There is genero&s;ity in the wi&s;h. It denotes a power in you of allaying one of the mo&s;t active fiends that torment mankind: the &s;pirit of revenge."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">"It is a &s;pirit I own to which I have been too &s;ubject; and which I could wi&s;h to exorci&s;e for ever."</P>
<P>"Put it to the te&s;t. Let us &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould di&s;cover as much of promi&s;e in Wakefield as you imagine you do in me."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould then put <HI>him</HI> to the te&s;t. I &s;hould demand of him to repair the wrongs he has done Mi&s;s Wilmot!"</P>
<P>"What if you &s;hould find him already &s;o di&s;po&s;ed?"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible. Or if he were, it would be with &s;ome de&s;ign!"</P>
<P>"Ay: perhaps a propo&s;ition that you &s;hould leave him quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the di&s;puted property."</P>
<P>"And, having obtained that, he would de&s;ert his &s;econd wife as he had done his fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"There is &s;ome difference between a young woman and an old one. Be&s;ide, if your account be true, Mrs. Wakefield,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
though &s;he was your mother, was very in|ferior to Mi&s;s Wilmot."</P>
<P>"You forget that he &s;educed this lady, and de&s;erted her."</P>
<P>"I have heard or read of a man who, after being divorced even from a wife, became more pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her than ever."</P>
<P>"Wakefield is incapable of love."</P>
<P>"You frame to your&s;elf a mo&s;t black and deformed being of this Wakefield."</P>
<P>"And you &s;uppo&s;e a degree of &s;ym|pathy, between your&s;elf and him, which cannot exi&s;t."</P>
<P>"Why not? His wit, per&s;on, and manners, I have heard you de&s;cribe as winning."</P>
<P>"I only gave the picture which I had from an affectionate though a mo&s;t in|jured woman."</P>
<P>"I recollect the &s;tory perfectly. When you repeated it, notwith&s;tanding my rail|lery, I was more moved than you had
<PB N="21" REF="23">
rea&s;on to imagine. I am per&s;uaded that Wakefield him&s;elf, had he li&s;tened to it, would have felt a few unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions."</P>
<P>"I fear, not."</P>
<P>"Why &s;o? Is he made of materials totally different from other men? Di&s;&s;ect him, and I imagine you will find he has a heart."</P>
<P>"But of what quality?"</P>
<P>"Better than you at pre&s;ent &s;eem to give him credit for."</P>
<P>"What grounds have you for thinking &s;o favourably of him?"</P>
<P>"Very excellent. Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed. I know the man."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"Where is the wonder? Knaves of other cla&s;&s;es a&s;&s;ociate, and why &s;hould not gamblers?"</P>
<P>"It may be, then, you are deputed to &s;peak in his behalf?"</P>
<P>"I wrote to you and introduced this
<PB N="22" REF="24">
conver&s;ation, for that very purpo&s;e. I know him as intimately as I can know any man. I would &s;peak of him as of my&s;elf, of his defects as of my own, and I declare it as my opinion that, if he might be permitted to enjoy his uncle's property in peace, he would change his &s;y&s;tem. To this property he &s;uppo&s;es he has the be&s;t claim. He is Thornby's heir at law; and, as to the manner in which the wealth he left was acquired, if a general inqui&s;ition were made into the original right to every &s;pecies of property, he is per&s;uaded that ninety-nine rich men in a hundred would be turned into the &s;treets to beg."</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>What you have related has greatly &s;urpri&s;ed me. You have pleaded and continue to plead his cau&s;e very power|fully: but have you no con&s;ideration for me? Granting all you have &s;uppo&s;ed in his favour po&s;&s;ible, am I &s;o &s;ituated as to ju&s;tify a romantic renunciation of claims
<PB N="23" REF="25">
which, if a&s;&s;erted, may aid me to accom|pli&s;h my deare&s;t hopes?</P>
<P>To a man like you perhaps I could be contented to re&s;ign the&s;e claims. I need not &s;ay 'perhaps': I am certain I could, were I thoroughly per&s;uaded you would for&s;ake a life of artifice and plunder, and were I my&s;elf only concerned.</P>
<P>But that is not the ca&s;e. I have an object to accompli&s;h &s;o dear to my heart that it &s;wallows up le&s;&s;er con&s;iderations, and will not allow me to neglect any hone&s;t means by which it may be pro|moted. Wealth to me is indi&s;pen&s;ible; wealth that &s;hall place me on a level with a rich and proud family with which I have to contend. I have an impul&s;e &s;uch perhaps as you have never felt. There is a woman in the world, endowed with &s;uch qualities that to &s;ay I pa&s;&s;ion|ately love her is a mo&s;t impotent ex|pre&s;&s;ion of what I feel: for to tenderne&s;s and ardour of affection mu&s;t be added
<PB N="24" REF="26">
all that &s;implicity, purity, and grandeur of &s;oul can in&s;pire. To think of life with|out her is to think of a world &s;terile, de&s;olate, and joyle&s;s: of a night to which day &s;hall never &s;ucceed: and of exi&s;tence arre&s;ted and chained in motionle&s;s de|&s;pondency.</P></Q>
<P>"Which might be very pitiful; or very &s;ublime: ju&s;t as you plea&s;e: but which would be very ab&s;urd."</P>
<P>"Granted: but this is the fever of my mind; the di&s;ea&s;e to which, &s;hould my hopes be di&s;appointed, I feel my&s;elf dangerou&s;ly impelled."</P>
<P>"The interpretation of all which is, that, though you have discovered prin|ciples, which if pur&s;ued would &s;ecure to your&s;elf and mankind in general certain happine&s;s, and that though you can deal forth their dogmas and point out the path which others indubitably ought to take, yet, when your own pa&s;&s;ions are concerned, you act like the re&s;t of the
<PB N="25" REF="27">
world. And you do this, not blindly, as they do, but, with your eyes open; at the moment that you are reminded of your maxims, and acknowledge their truth."</P>
<P>"Your accu&s;ation is premature. I have hitherto done nothing more than expre&s;s my feelings and my doubts."</P>
<P>"But the&s;e doubts, &s;purred on by the&s;e feelings, a&s;&s;ure me that you will proceed again&s;t Wakefield."</P>
<P>"You may think your&s;elf a&s;&s;ured: I conceive my&s;elf to be uncertain. I would willingly condemn my&s;elf to great pu|ni&s;hment, were it to promote any plan of the goodne&s;s of which there &s;hould be a conviction, I can even &s;uppo&s;e ca&s;es in which I would not only devote my life, for that in compari&s;on appears to be a trifle, but would re&s;ign the woman whom my &s;oul adores. Sacrifices like the&s;e however cannot be expected on light oc|ca&s;ions. The good to be obtained ought
<PB N="26" REF="28">
to be evidently greater than the evil to be endured."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a moment to collect his ideas, and then replied.</P>
<P>"If, Mr. Trevor, you are the man of that eminent virtue which I have &s;ome|times thought you, and to which by your di&s;cour&s;e to me you have certainly made very lofty preten&s;ions, I would advi&s;e you to reflect on what I &s;hall once more &s;tate. I know that this Wakefield, of whom you think &s;o ill, and who has been quite as guilty as you have &s;uppo&s;ed, is now inclined to be a different man. I would have you con&s;ider, fir&s;t, to whom does the property in ju&s;tice belong? I think you will find that to be doubtful. Next, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be legally yours, may you not neverthele&s;s be defrauded of it by law? And, la&s;tly, appeal to your own principles, and a&s;k your&s;elf whether it be not better that you &s;hould have a chance of doing the good which you conceive
<PB N="27" REF="29">
would be done, by recovering &s;uch a man as Wakefield to that re&s;pect in &s;ociety by which his talents might be well em|ployed; or whether it can be con&s;i&s;tent with your own &s;en&s;e of right to take methods which you acknowledge to be precarious, and unju&s;t, in order to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s him and to appropriate that to your&s;elf to which, if you are impartial, you will perhaps find it difficult to prove, even to your own &s;atisfaction, that you have a clear and undoubted claim?"</P>
<P>Through this whole &s;cene, in&s;tead of diverting my attention from the argument by gay raillery, witty allu&s;ions, or a re|currence to the depravity of man, and the practice of the world, he kept clo&s;ely to the que&s;tion, pre&s;erved the tone of earne&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and, having uttered what I have la&s;t repeated, took his leave with that &s;erious air which he had thus unexpectedly a&s;&s;umed, and maintained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE PLAN OF WAKEFIELD PURSUED, AND THE HOPES AND FEARS OF AN AFFECTIONATE WO|MAN. NEWS OF PHILIP. AN ARTLESS EXCUL|PATORY TALE.</HEAD>
<P>QUITTING the place, meditating on the &s;cene that had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;urpri&s;ed at every part of it, at the intere&s;ted manner of the man, at the intimate knowledge which he profe&s;&s;ed to have of Wakefield, at the promi&s;es and the threats which he appeared to make in his name, at the coincidence not only of their characters, if his account were true, but at their &s;imilar incidents of fortune and corre|&s;ponding inclinations to reform, a&s;to|ni&s;hed while I recollected the&s;e various particulars, in&s;tead of returning immedi|ately to my lodgings I called on Mi&s;s Wilmot.</P>
<P>When I came to the door, I had
<PB N="29" REF="31">
&s;carcely decided with my&s;elf whether it were advi&s;able to relate what had pa&s;&s;ed to her, which as &s;he was per&s;onally in que&s;tion I thought my&s;elf bound to do whenever it could be done with &s;afety; or whether, if related at pre&s;ent, it might not excite hopes that would be di&s;ap|pointed, and anxieties prejudicial to her peace.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner &s;aw me than &s;he ex|claimed&mdash;"I am very glad you are come, Mr. Trevor! I have two unexpected af|fairs, on which I wi&s;h to con&s;ult you. One of them relates to my&s;elf; and I will begin with that becau&s;e you are not only concerned in it but are appealed to in a very remarkable manner. I have received two extraordinary letters; by both of which I have been not a little affected. Pray read this fir&s;t. It is from Mr. Wakefield. The promi&s;es it contains, the &s;tyle it a&s;&s;umes, and the
<PB N="30" REF="32">
appeal it makes, are &s;o &s;trange as to ap|pear either like miracle or romance."</P>
<P>She then gave me a letter, and I read as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Should you imagine, Lydia, that be|cau&s;e I have long forborn all intercour&s;e with you I have forgotten you, be a&s;&s;ured you are mi&s;taken. I have treated you &s;o &s;hamefully, and deceived you &s;o often, that I have little right to expect you &s;hould believe my profe&s;&s;ions, be moved by my intreaties, or remember me with any other feelings than tho&s;e of hatred. Yet, to deal &s;incerely with you, this is what I do not expect. I have had &s;uch proofs of the kindne&s;s of your heart, and the &s;trength of your affection, that my confidence is &s;till entire.</P>
<P>It is the more un&s;haken becau&s;e my own intentions are direct: of which the plainne&s;s with which I &s;hall deliver my thoughts will I imagine be &s;ome proof.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">I once more repeat, I have behaved to you like a &mdash; Spare me the word. It is enough to recollect that I have been the thing. I could plead the extreme vivacity of my youth, my ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions, and the dangerous temptation of critical moments; but that I will not exhibit any feature of pitiful apology, or endeavour to extenuate what I cannot defend.</P>
<P>You are intimate, with Mr. Trevor. You know that his mother, my late wife, is dead; and you have heard of a will, &s;aid to have been left by my uncle. I feel but little &s;cruple in affirming that I imbibed many of the vices of my early youth from being placed under this uncle's care. That &s;uch a man &s;hould die like a coward, and endeavour to di&s;inherit a re|lation to &s;ave his &s;oul, &s;uppo&s;ing this di&s;|inheritance to be true, would be no miracle. It would only be an act of contemptible &s;tupidity.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">I will not here enter into any en|quiries of a legal kind: for I will be open enough to own that, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both in right of my wife and as the heir of my uncle of the property he left, and determined as I am to a&s;&s;ert my claims, which I think paramount to tho&s;e of any other per&s;on, I will not commit my&s;elf even to you. On the contrary, I write this letter purpo&s;ely that you may &s;hew it to Mr. Trevor.</P>
<P>You will a&s;k my motive for this? and perhaps will be &s;urpri&s;ed at my an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>By certain whim&s;ical accidents, I have become acquainted with Mr. Tre|vor's principles. I believe, or I rather know, him to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a heart and under&s;tanding equally excellent. I wi&s;h to appeal to them both. When he &s;hall read this, he will have had a conver&s;ation relating to me; which may have led him to expect the language I am about to u&s;e.
<PB N="33" REF="35">
In an argument concerning property he cannot forget that he lately delivered him&s;elf thus:</P>
<P>'If I &s;trictly adhere to the principle of ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t not &s;ingly con&s;ider my own wi&s;hes; which may create innume|rable fal&s;e wants, and crave to have them gratified. I mu&s;t a&s;k is there no being, within my knowledge, who may be more benefited by the enjoyment of that which I am de&s;irous to appropriate to my&s;elf than I can? If &s;o, what right have I to prefer &s;elf gratification to &s;uperior utility?'</P>
<P>Mine is a ca&s;e in point.</P>
<P>Again: property is left for which he may be induced to contend; and which, &s;hould he do &s;o, will probably be di&s;&s;i|pated in law. If not, it may with no le&s;s probability be decided by law to be mine. He affirms that to contend at law is im|moral.</P>
<P>"Do you and he li&s;ten to what I have now to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">I am de&s;irous of totally changing my conduct. I have a heart more capable of affection than you, Lydia, have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e; and I love you. My am|bition at pre&s;ent is to do you much more good than I have ever done you harm. I am once more at my own di&s;po&s;al; and, unle&s;s that ardent love which you for|merly bore me be entirely changed, which I do not believe it is, I am now &s;incerely de&s;irous to make you my wife.</P>
<P>But I will not deceive you. I can only be &s;uch a hu&s;band as you de&s;ire on condition of being left in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which I believe to be my own. I have ruined my character. Offices of emolument are not ea&s;ily obtained; but, if they were, I am not a man to be tru&s;ted. I will not live a beggar; deprived of all the ble&s;&s;ings in which the fools around me wallow, till they turn them into cur&s;es. I wi&s;h to live happily: unmo|le&s;ting, and unmole&s;ted: but, if I mu&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="37">
either prey or be preyed upon, I am &s;till re&s;olved rather to act the fox than the goo&s;e.</P>
<P>I know you will condemn this de|termination; but I am &s;peaking openly; and telling you what my intentions are, without entering into their defence.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing Mr. Trevor to be con|vinced that the law will decide the pro|perty conte&s;ted in his favour, the &s;acrifice demanded of him is perhaps too great to be expected from any man. Yet, from what I have heard and what I know, this is the &s;acrifice that I do expect. I ex|pect it from his abhorrence of pretending to &s;eek ju&s;tice by the aid of law. I expect it from that principle which decides in fa|vour of the greate&s;t good. And I expect it from the earne&s;t de&s;ire I have heard him expre&s;s that you might be re&s;tored to that happine&s;s which, for a time, you have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Should he or you conclude that the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
motives I now urge originate in that ar|tifice of which I have been very ju&s;tly accu&s;ed, I ought perhaps to feel no &s;ur|pri&s;e, and &s;hall certainly make no com|plaint. But, believe me or believe me not, I have &s;poken with a &s;incerity of heart for which I am likely to gain but little credit. Such I feel, at this mo|ment, are the misfortunes to which cun|ning &s;ubjects it&s;elf. I am a man but little &s;ubject to fear: yet, I own, the fear of being thought &s;till to po&s;&s;e&s;s no|thing better than this cunning a&s;&s;aults me, obliges me to omit the tender epi|thets that are in my thoughts, and with|out addition to &s;ign my&s;elf</P>

</LETTER>
<P>While I read, the eyes of Mi&s;s Wil|mot were fixed upon my countenance. Whenever I looked toward her, I could perceive the &s;trong emotions, of hope and fear, by which &s;he was agitated.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">When I had ended, I &s;aid&mdash;"Mr. Wakefield is indeed an extraordinary man! Be his intentions hone&s;t or ba&s;e, the &s;trength and clearne&s;s of his mind and his knowledge of the human heart, when we recollect how the&s;e faculties have been employed, are truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing. If this be a plan of artifice, it is little le&s;s than miraculous. Yet who can believe it to be any thing el&s;e?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot heaved a deep &s;igh, and attempted to &s;peak: but &s;he only &s;tam|mered. Her utterance failed; and her eyes were ca&s;t on the floor. Hope and de&s;pair were combating; and the latter was the &s;tronge&s;t. She wi&s;hed to con|fide, &s;he wi&s;hed to plead for the po&s;&s;ibility of his being &s;incere: but the mi&s;chief he had inflicted, the deceit he had practi&s;ed, and a rememberance of the picture &s;he had formerly given me of him, ru&s;hed upon her mind; and her &s;pirits &s;unk.</P>
<P>"Look up, lovely Lydia," &s;aid I, tak|ing
<PB N="38" REF="40">
her hand, "and revive. There is there mu&s;t be hope. The man who could write this letter cannot be all villain."</P>
<P>The &s;truggle of the pa&s;&s;ions was violent. A momentary wildne&s;s, &s;uch as I had formerly witne&s;&s;ed, fla&s;hed in her eyes; &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat, griped my hand, then bur&s;ting into tears exclaimed&mdash; "Oh Mr. Trevor!" and dropped down again upon the chair.</P>
<P>Eager to relieve a heart &s;o overcharged; I again addre&s;&s;ed her. "If," &s;aid I, "the property left by Mr. Wakefield's uncle can really be employed to &s;o noble a purpo&s;e as that of reclaiming him and making you happy, let me peri&s;h rather than endeavour to counteract &s;uch ble&s;|&s;ings. Let me be the thing he &s;o much dreads, a beggar: but let me obey the pure&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the heart, when they are &s;anctioned by the be&s;t principles of the under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>'Till this in&s;tant &s;he had forgotten that,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
if I con&s;ented to enrich him, I mu&s;t rob my&s;elf. But the thought no &s;ooner oc|curred than &s;he cried, "No! It mu&s;t not be! It cannot be! To require it of you is infamous. It deba&s;es him, and would make me hate my&s;elf; were I to participate in &s;uch an action."</P>
<P>"You judge too &s;everely," I replied. "I am not &s;o unfortunately circum&s;tanced as he is. My character is not lo&s;t. I am not &s;hut out of &s;ociety. I have friends, plans, and pro&s;pects; and, granting him to be &s;incere, his arguments, as far as they relate to him and me, are I &s;u&s;pect unan&s;werable. Of that &s;incerity I would fain not doubt: but it is our mutual duty to be wary. Here therefore at pre&s;ent the matter &s;hall re&s;t. I am determined to bring no action, till time and future events &s;hall teach me the cour&s;e I ought to pur&s;ue."</P>
<P>Overwhelmed by a &s;en&s;e of obligation, and by the thronging emotions of every
<PB N="40" REF="42">
kind that a&s;&s;ailed her, &s;he was again half &s;uffocated with pa&s;&s;ion. As &s;he re|covered her eyes &s;ufficiently &s;poke her feelings.</P>
<P>When &s;he grew calm, &s;he was led to a&s;k what conver&s;ation I had had, and with whom, relative to Mr. Wakefield? I gave her the hi&s;tory of my acquaintance with the &s;uppo&s;ed Belmont, and of the &s;cene that had pa&s;&s;ed that very day: which &s;he thought altogether &s;urpri&s;ing, and &s;eemed to &s;hrink with the fear that it was an artful plan, contrived by artful men. She was in &s;ome &s;ort appea&s;ed, however, when I once more reminded her of my determination to wait and hope for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I then enquired concerning the &s;econd letter &s;he had mentioned? To which &s;he an&s;wered&mdash;"It is addre&s;&s;ed to me, as a mediator: but relates entirely to you, and the per&s;on who wrote it; your poor penitent &s;ervant, Philip."</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">She gave it me; and the&s;e were its contents.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I make bold to lay my ca&s;e before you; which as it is very grievous I hope it may move you to pity me. I am the young man that lived with my honoured ma&s;ter Mr. Trevor; in the &s;ame hou&s;e, madam, that you are plea&s;ed to live. My name is Philip. I have been guilty of a very great fault; for which my con&s;cience worries me night and day. So that I am &s;ure I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf: though I take my holy &s;aviour to witne&s;s it was more a mi&s;take than a thought of com|mitting &s;o wicked a crime. I was in a flurry, &s;o that I did not know what I was about; for to think of having robbed a ma&s;ter that was &s;o kind to me is &s;uch a &s;in and a &s;hame as never was. But I had no notion but that my poor dear ma&s;ter had drowned him&s;elf in the river; and
<PB N="42" REF="44">
&s;o, as he had told me the day before to make up my account and he would pay me the next morning, I thought it was hard that I &s;hould lo&s;e my wages and the money be&s;ide which I had laid out for wa&s;hing, and new&s;papers, and tea, and &s;ugar, and other materials of that kind: which, though my wages <HI>was</HI> only eight pounds eight &s;hillings, made up the whole to twelve pounds five and three-pence three farthings. Which was the rea&s;on to make me do &s;o ba&s;e a thing as it would el&s;e have been as to break open the box, and take out a ten pound note, and four pair of &s;tockings, and two wai&s;t-coats: becau&s;e I knew very well my ma&s;ter's kindne&s;s &s;o that it is ten to one if he had lived to make his will he would have given me them and more. After which I hurried away: being as I was told of a place, with an old ma&s;ter that I was &s;ure would take me again. But I had no more thought that Mr. Trevor
<PB N="43" REF="45">
was living than the child unborn: which &s;ince I di&s;covered I have never been at re&s;t; being out of place, and having no|body now to a&s;k for a character, which is the greate&s;t misfortin that can behappen a poor &s;ervant that never was guilty of &s;uch an action as breaking open his ma&s;|ter's box, and running away with his money and things, in all my life before, or &s;ince. So that I was tempted to li&s;t for a &s;oldier; but that I happened, ho|noured madam, to meet your maid Mary, and &s;he per&s;uaded me to write to Mr. Trevor: which I dur&s;t not do, though I know his goodne&s;s. So &s;he &s;aid your honoured lady&s;hip would be &s;o kind and tender hearted as to lay my ca&s;e before Mr. Trevor, and my dear and honoured mi&s;tre&s;s, Mi&s;s Mowbray, both of <HI>which</HI> I would run to the world's end to &s;erve. On which &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure they would take my ca&s;e into merciful con|&s;ideration,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
and grant me their gracious forgivene&s;s.</P>

<P>Poor fellow! Forgive thee? What is thy crime? An inaccuracy. A mi&s;take of judgment. A de&s;ire to do thy&s;elf right, without intentional wrong to me or any one. Yet for this mi&s;take, dif|ferently circum&s;tanced, thou mighte&s;t have lo&s;t thy life, and have been hanged like a dog!</P>
<P>I too accu&s;ed thee of robbery, of tak|ing more than thy due, when thou tooke&s;t le&s;s. Had&s;t thou offered thy old wai&s;t-coats and &s;tockings to a &s;treet hawker, he would not have given thee half the &s;urplus that was thy due.</P>
<P>Such were the reflections that broke
<PB N="45" REF="47">
from me, after peru&s;ing his &s;imple but affecting defence.</P>
<P>Mary was called up, and que&s;tioned. She knew where he lived: for the poor, little inclined to &s;u&s;picion, confide in each other. It is the rich only that tempt them to be treacherous.</P>
<P>After con&s;ulting with Mi&s;s Wilmot, it was determined that &s;he &s;hould write to Olivia; enclo&s;ing Philip's letter, and re|que&s;ting her to give him a character. I knew &s;he would take care to &s;ee him paid the wages that were his due; and, as I had been the cau&s;e of his want of em|ployment &s;ince the fright he took at Cranford-bridge, I left money to reim|bur&s;e him for the lo&s;s of his time from that period.</P>
<P>The people I mixed with, and the prejudices of the world, required that I &s;hould keep a &s;ervant: but, though the man that was with me was by no means &s;o great a favourite as Philip had been, I
<PB N="46" REF="48">
did not think I had &s;ufficient cau&s;e to di&s;charge him for another. There was an additional motive for not wi&s;hing Phi|lip to be my &s;ervant again; at lea&s;t not under my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. Olivia's aunt had imagined we were in league, at Cranford-bridge; and, &s;hould &s;he &s;ee him once more in my &s;ervice, that &s;u&s;picion might either be revived or &s;trengthened.</P>

THREATENING APPEARANCES. A JOUR|NEY PROJECTED. A TRAGICAL EVENT, GIVING OCCASION TO THE PRACTICE OF SOME SMALL PORTION OF HUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;&s;olution of parliament was hourly expected. Flying reports fixed it to happen on different days; but none
<PB N="47" REF="49">
of them very di&s;tant. The zeal of Sir Barnard, in behalf of his country and its con&s;titution, was unabated. The mea|&s;ures of mini&s;try were wicked beyond example; and the &s;ervility of parliament was unequalled, &s;ince the time of the Tudors. Such was the Baronet's con|tinual theme.</P>
<P>From him, and the political circles I frequented, I heard news in which I might be &s;aid to be per&s;onally concerned. In con&s;equence of the firm refu&s;al of Olivia, a rupture had taken place between Lord Idford and the family: much at fir&s;t to the regret of the Mowbrays; till the turn that the quarrel took en|flamed the latter.</P>
<P>Hector Mowbray had great property, and influence, in the county of which he and I were both natives. Of this county the Earl was the Lord Lieutenant; and here he likewi&s;e had his dependents, and parti&s;ans. The Mowbrays were wealthy;
<PB N="48" REF="50">
and Hector was ambitious of being elect|ed knight of the &s;hire. When it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, the aunt forwarded the project: for there was no probability that any other candidate &s;o powerful &s;hould &s;tart. The joint intere&s;t of the Earl and the Mowbrays would defy oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Earl however under&s;tood traffic; and, finding him&s;elf &s;o po&s;itively refu&s;ed by Olivia, he thought proper to inform the family that &s;he mu&s;t either be induced to con&s;ent, or, in&s;tead of aiding to bring Hector into parliament, he &s;hould him|&s;elf propo&s;e and &s;upport another candi|date with the whole weight of his in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>The threat was galling. It was in|&s;inuated fir&s;t to the aunt; and, when Hector was informed of it, he affected to vapour and treat it with defiance: but, on better con&s;ideration, he and the aunt thought proper to importune Olivia, hoping they &s;hould oblige her to comply.
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Threats and intreaties alike were vain. Her re&s;olution was not to be &s;haken; and the Earl more openly declared that, if &s;he &s;hould think proper to per&s;i&s;t, he would beggar him&s;elf rather than Hector &s;hould carry his election.</P>
<P>Hector had been canva&s;&s;ing the county, had &s;ub&s;cribed to races, been pre&s;ent at the a&s;&s;izes, given public dinners, and taken various means to increa&s;e his popu|larity; of which he had become inordi|nately vain. Inflated therefore with a certainty of victory, he threw down the gauntlet, and dared the Earl to the field.</P>
<P>In the mean time, paragraphs appeared in a morning and an evening paper, both of them &s;old to Government, and the echoes of each other, that were evidently aimed at me, and my connections. At fir&s;t I could not have conceived how I &s;hould have attracted the attention of tho&s;e worthy gentlemen, who earn their bread by the daily manufactory of lam|poons:
<PB N="50" REF="52">
but I was &s;oon informed that this is become a regular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s; and that the motives to carry it on are many. The&s;e motives originate in pay-ma&s;ters, of various de&s;criptions: of whom the trea&s;ury is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the chief.</P>
<P>The libels, of which I was the &s;ubject, aimed to be &s;atirical; but were too dull of wing to hit their mark: they were on|ly malignant. They could neither tickle the fancy nor gall the heart; but they proved that I had lurking enemies, who wi&s;hed to wound, did they but know when and where to &s;trike.</P>
<P>It was well known that my profe&s;&s;edly dear friend, Glibly, was principally con|cerned in the morning paper where the&s;e libels generally appeared. When I fir&s;t became acquainted with him, he affected indifference to parties; and was ready to prai&s;e or laugh at either, as circum|&s;tances &s;hould happen to direct him: but, when the temper of the times became
<PB N="51" REF="53">
intolerant and acrimonious, he thought it prudent to take a decided part. That &s;uch a man &s;hould declare in favour of the weake&s;t was not to be expected; and he now a&s;&s;ociated with the known hire|lings of mini&s;try, of whom I was a &s;till more open and undi&s;gui&s;ed opponent.</P>
<P>By the&s;e attacks on me, Glibly there|fore, for they were undoubtedly a part of his handy-work, Glibly, I &s;ay, had a three|fold motive. He indulged a propen&s;ity, which &s;trange to &s;ay he had acquired, of wounding in the dark, that he might &s;mile and &s;hake hands with the in&s;ulted per&s;on in broad day; he an&s;wered the end for which mini&s;try retained him, that of decrying all its antagoni&s;ts; and he particularly forwarded the views of ano|ther of his dear friends, the Earl.</P>
<P>The general complexion of paragraphs like the&s;e is fal&s;ehood; which is &s;ome|times direct, though it is more common|ly a perver&s;ion of exi&s;ting facts. The
<PB N="52" REF="54">
pamphlet I had written, which had been partially made known to the public by the adverti&s;ement that had appeared, the patronage of Sir Barnard, my ambitious views on the Mowbray family, with &s;uch other particulars as the indefatigable Glibly could collect, &s;ometimes delivered in ob&s;cure allu&s;ions and at others more openly, were the topics of calumny. How many of the&s;e ingenious devices to irritate and injure were framed I never knew: for I &s;eldom read them my&s;elf, though I heard of them &s;ufficiently often to be a&s;&s;ured that they were numerous.</P>
<P>There were various means by which they might have been &s;topped; and of which, in ordinary ca&s;es bribing is chiefly practi&s;ed: but in this in&s;tance fighting, or the law, would have been more effectual. Of the&s;e however I totally di&s;approved. Defamation is an evil: but death is ge|nerally and perhaps always a greater; and to prevent enquiry is among the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
wor&s;t of evils. I was not yet &s;ufficiently acquainted, however, with the mi&s;takes to which men are &s;ubject, or rather im|pelled by the in&s;titutions they admire, not to feel great &s;urpri&s;e and &s;ome indig|nation at the ob&s;tacles which I found were continually to impede my career. He who has never travelled into the country of Mo&s;quitoes is not aware how &s;light a net-work covering will pre&s;erve him from their &s;ting.</P>
<P>The&s;e were trifles, and would have been unworthy of notice had they not re&s;em|bled the &s;mall cloudy &s;peck, which, though &s;carcely vi&s;ible in the di&s;tant ho|rizon, approaches, and &s;wells, and bur&s;ts over the head in a &s;torm. The begin|ning conte&s;t between the Earl and the Mowbray family, the intere&s;t which the worthy Mr. Glibly had thought proper to take in me and my affairs, the patri|oti&s;m of Sir Barnard, nay the friend&s;hip of Mr. Evelyn him&s;elf, that be&s;t of men,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
were but &s;o many links in the chain of that fate which was impending.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, however, with re&s;pect to the Baronet, I daily increa&s;ed in favour. He frequently reque&s;ted me to accom|pany him when he went down to the hou&s;e; and paraded with me, arm in arm, through the avenues: catching eve|ry man he knew by the button, and in|troducing me; then de&s;canting on the news of the day, the victories of the mi|ni&s;ter among his creatures and in the hou&s;e, and the defeats of his projects every where el&s;e.</P>
<P>At length it was generally affirmed and believed that parliament would be di&s;|&s;olved in a fortnight; and, as Sir Bar|nard wi&s;hed to keep well with his bo|rough, he propo&s;ed that we &s;hould go down and vi&s;it the worthy and independent electors: among whom he ob&s;erved we might &s;pend a few days in a plea&s;ant manner, and advantageou&s;ly to his inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
till the writ of election &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued. This was on the Wedne&s;day: but, as there was to be a debate and pro|bably a divi&s;ion of the hou&s;e on Friday, his &s;en&s;e of public duty would not per|mit him to be ab&s;ent on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, and we agreed to defer our jour|ney till Saturday morning.</P>
<P>During this &s;hort interval an incident occurred, which it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould relate. It happened on the Thur&s;day that, after &s;pending the day near Rich|mond, where I had been invited to dine, I was returning home on hor&s;eback, fol|lowed by my &s;ervant: for I thought my|&s;elf obliged to practi&s;e &s;ome part of that ari&s;tocracy which I neverthele&s;s very &s;in|cerely condemned.</P>
<P>The night was &s;tarlight; and, as we were cantering down a lane at the en|trance of Barnes common, we heard di&s;|tant cries and the report of a pi&s;tol, in the direction as we believed in which we
<PB N="56" REF="58">
were proceeding. I immediately &s;top|ped, and li&s;tened very attentively: but all was &s;oon &s;ilent. Being convinced as well by the cries as the firing of the pi&s;|tol that a robbery, if not &s;omething wor&s;e, had been committed, and not certainly knowing from what point the &s;ound came, I rode gently forward and conti|nued to li&s;ten with the utmo&s;t attention: de&s;iring my &s;ervant to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We rode on, &s;till walking our hor&s;es and looking cautiou&s;ly round for &s;ome time, without any &s;ight or &s;ound of man approaching us, till we came to a gate at the edge of the common. Here I &s;aw a hor&s;e &s;tanding patiently, without his rider; and &s;topping once more to look and li&s;ten, I pre&s;ently perceived an in|di&s;tinct object: which I di&s;covered to be a man; wounded and weltering in his blood.</P>
<P>I &s;poke to him: but no an&s;wer was re|turned, nor any &s;ound. I then rai&s;ed the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
body in my arms, and it appeared to be lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>What was to be done? A human being, who might be dead or might not, in either ca&s;e, mu&s;t not be left in &s;uch a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The neighbourhood is populous, and I could di&s;tingui&s;h lights at no very great di&s;tance. Fearing left, if I &s;ent my &s;er|vant he &s;hould blunder, or that the per|&s;ons he might addre&s;s him&s;elf to would be le&s;s likely to pay attention to him than to me, I bade him remain by the dead or wounded man; and, mounting my hor&s;e, I rode away immediately to procure aid.</P>
<P>My direction was acro&s;s the common; and fortunately I met with a carriage, which proved to be a hackney coach re|turning to town with two pa&s;&s;engers. I ordered the coachman to &s;top, and he im|mediately &s;uppo&s;ed I was a highwayman: but, being undeceived, he refu&s;ed to go out of his way for the purpo&s;e I required.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">The per&s;ons within, hearing a kind of &s;quabble, and under&s;tanding when they li&s;tened the nature of it, &s;poke to me; and enquired into the particulars. By good luck, they happened to feel properly, and joined me again&s;t the coachman; who, though unwillingly, was obliged to &s;ub|mit; and, when he came to the point where the roads join, to turn back and receive the wounded man into the carriage. The pa&s;&s;engers alighted, I ordered my man to take the hor&s;e of the &s;tranger in charge, and we proceeded &s;lowly to the fir&s;t inn.</P>
<P>Here I immediately enquired for &s;ur|gical and medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, as the people of the&s;e villages are many of them opulent, good practitioners were pre&s;ent|ly procured.</P>
<P>While the me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched, I had lei&s;ure to examine the &s;tranger; who&s;e appearance, figure, and counte|nance, were altogether extremely inte|re&s;ting. His hair was abundant, but
<PB N="59" REF="61">
milk white, his features were &s;erene, and his form in de&s;pite of age was &s;till manly. The benevolence of his countenance was heightened by the blood with which his locks were in part clotted, and that had &s;treamed over his face upon his clothes and linen.</P>
<P>The medical gentlemen arrived nearly at the &s;ame time, the &s;tranger was exa|mined, the pul&s;ation of the heart was perceptible, and, though the contu&s;ions on the head and the temple were vio|lent, and he had been &s;hot in the &s;houl|der, &s;o that the ball had pa&s;&s;ed through behind, they were of opinion, as there was no fracture of the &s;kull, that the wounds were not mortal. The appear|ance of the &s;tranger, and the condition in which I found him, had made a lively impre&s;&s;ion upon me. I was fearful of leaving him, in an unknown place, amid&s;t the ca&s;ualties and hurry of an inn, to the care of waiters, and the neglect of per&s;ons
<PB N="60" REF="62">
who had &s;carcely lei&s;ure to be humane. I therefore determined to &s;end my &s;er|vant to town, and &s;tay with him that night. I had an appointment and other bu&s;ine&s;s in the morning; but I could be at London in le&s;s than an hour: that was therefore no ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>Hoping to have di&s;covered his place of abode, I de&s;ired his pockets to be &s;earch|ed before the people pre&s;ent: but they were entirely emptied; and contained no paper, or memorandum, that could afford information.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, by the aid which was procured, his pul&s;e began to quicken, and his lungs to do their office; and, that nothing might be omitted, I prevailed on the phy&s;ician to remain with me at his bed-&s;ide, and attend to every &s;ymptom, above half the night. With this he the more willingly complied becau&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive of fever, when the circula|tion &s;hould recover all its ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">In the morning, though very unwil|lingly, I was obliged to for&s;ake my charge: but not till I had le&s;t money with the phy&s;ician, who made him&s;elf accountable to the innkeeper for all ex|pences. Being a humane per&s;on, I believe he would have done this without my in|terference. But in addition to that every mark about the &s;tranger, his look, his dre&s;s and the hor&s;e on which he was mounted, denoted him to be a gentle|man; and when I left him, though the phy&s;ician thought it was probable he might not recover the u&s;e of his under|&s;tanding and the power of &s;peech for a day or two, he yet was per&s;uaded that he would not die.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. AN INCIDENT IN THE PARK, OR THE DANGER OF UNRULY DOGS AND HORSES. THE FORTITUDE AND AFFECTION OF OLIVIA. A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED STRANGER.</HEAD>
<P>KNOWING the habits of Sir Barnard to be preci&s;e, and petti&s;h, &s;o that if I counteracted the arrangement he had made it would put him into a di&s;agree|able temper, I re&s;olved, as we were to depart early the next morning, to return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;tranger. About two in the afternoon, I was riding through the park for this purpo&s;e: and here another incident occurred; which, though it excited extreme terror, it after|ward afforded uncommon delight.</P>
<P>A few days before, I had witne&s;&s;ed a lady on a run-away hor&s;e, who was &s;eized with fright, dropped from the faddle, and brui&s;ed her&s;elf exceedingly. She would
<PB N="63" REF="65">
have been in no danger, if &s;he had be|haved but with the ordinary re&s;olution of a man; and the accident led me to reflect on the ill education to which women are &s;ubjected. They &s;eem to be e&s;teemed by men in proportion as they are helple&s;s, timid, and dependent. It is &s;uppo&s;ed they cannot be affectionate unle&s;s their leading feature be imbecility.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I had cro&s;&s;ed the bridge over the Serpentine river, two ladies and a gentleman with their grooms, all on hor&s;eback, were turning round; and went off in a hand gallop toward Ken&s;ington gardens. I was riding fa&s;t, at no great di&s;tance; and perceived it to be Olivia, her aunt, and &s;ome per&s;on whom I did not know. Olivia was mounted on a fine blood hor&s;e; and a large dog ru&s;hed by him in pur&s;uit of me, being tempted by my fa&s;t galloping.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e of Olivia had previou&s;ly been put upon his mettle. I &s;aw the dan|ger,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
and in&s;tantly pulled up: but he be|gan to plunge, and kick, in a manner that would have unhor&s;ed mo&s;t men. The dog then turned from me, and at|tacked the animal that was highe&s;t in motion; and the hor&s;e immediately &s;et off full &s;peed. The fooli&s;h &s;ervant, being frightened, began to gallop after her. I was obliged to do the &s;ame, and &s;top him: for the clattering of feet behind did but increa&s;e the fury of the runaway hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Terrified however as I was, when I fir&s;t noticed the vicious propen&s;ities of the hor&s;e, the courage of Olivia was &s;uch, her &s;eat was &s;o firm, and &s;he kept &s;o &s;teady a hold of the &s;trong curb rein, that I felt a confidence &s;he would over|power the hor&s;e; if the fear and folly of &s;ome other per&s;on &s;hould do no mi&s;chief. I therefore followed at a proper di&s;tance; and, when I &s;aw &s;everal hor&s;emen who attempted to cro&s;s her, I &s;houted and waved my hat for them to keep off.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">My hopes were ju&s;tified. She avoided every danger, by her management and pre&s;ence of mind; and, by her u&s;e of the curb and the aid of the wall at the end of the ride, arre&s;ted the cour&s;e of the in|temperate animal.</P>
<P>Having kept the grooms back, I was the fir&s;t that came up with her; and, leaping from my &s;addle, I &s;eized the reins and held them till the &s;ervant ar|rived. I then enjoyed one more rap|turous moment, &s;uch as I had indeed but little fore&s;een: I received her in my arms.</P>
<P>Not a minute before, how firm and collected had her mind and actions been: but no &s;ooner did &s;he feel my embrace than her frame was &s;uffu&s;ed. A thou&s;and ideas, that had no relation to the danger which her own fortitude had e&s;caped, immediately ru&s;hed upon her; &s;he &s;unk upon my &s;houlder, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears. They were the heart ea&s;ings
<PB N="66" REF="68">
of ten thou&s;and of the foregone anxieties of love.</P>
<P>How could I have hated the broad day, and the prying eyes that were upon us! How welcome would the fogs and darkne&s;s of Cranford-bridge have been! My adventurous &s;pirit would then have &s;urely imprinted the fir&s;t ki&s;s of love! as cha&s;te as it would have been ec&s;tatic.</P>
<P>This bli&s;s, alas, was not to be. The crowd approached. I pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, as an a&s;&s;urance of fidelity, &s;he gently returned the token of kindne&s;s. Such mute &s;igns being all that were per|mitted.</P>
<P>Perceiving I mu&s;t leave her, I again reque&s;ted &s;he would not mount the un|ruly hor&s;e; and &s;he replied, with a hea|venly &s;mile, "Have no fear for me. I will be careful of my&s;elf;" to which &s;he ad|ded in a low whi&s;per: "for my pre|&s;erver's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>Oh moments of unutterable bli&s;s!
<PB N="67" REF="69">
Who can e&s;timate your worth? One of you will outweigh a life, &s;uch as the dull round of common place nothings can yield.</P>
<P>Did not my eyes thank her? Did not the &s;trong workings of my colour and countenance inform her of what was pa&s;&s;ing within? Oh yes! And in the &s;ame language &s;he involuntarily replied. He who &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e there was one emo|tion which cele&s;tial purity might not ap|prove cannot comprehend Olivia. They were emanations &s;uch as tho&s;e only who have &s;ouls, as well as bodies, are ac|quainted with.</P>
<P>The tide of ec&s;tacy mu&s;t turn. The aunt came up, I bowed, &s;he returned my &s;alute in a manner that &s;hewed her mind was affected by contradictory emotions, and I mounted my hor&s;e and guided his head toward the Park gate; through which I pa&s;&s;ed; feeling, at the moment, that I was pa&s;&s;ing the gate of paradi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">I had not however left all my heaven behind me. No: I bore with me ample &s;tores for delicious revery. The fortitude of Olivia, the firm and ea&s;y grace with which &s;he kept her &s;eat, her admirable management and quick pre&s;ence of mind, her unabating courage at one moment, and her melting tenderne&s;s at the next, were not the food but the fea&s;t of love.</P>
<P>In this revelry of the imagination I indulged, till I arrived at the inn; where I found the phy&s;ician, agreeable to ap|pointment; and was informed by him that the &s;tranger &s;till continued in&s;en|&s;ible: but that the &s;ymptoms appeared to be rather more than le&s;s favourable.</P>
<P>I remained with the patient during &s;ome hours, till the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for my journey obliged me to depart. I then left a &s;ufficient &s;um with the phy|&s;ician; and, after mo&s;t earne&s;tly recom|mending the &s;tranger to his care, re|luctantly returned to town.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">Though I had obtained a promi&s;e, from the phy&s;ician, that the patient &s;hould be removed to his own home, as &s;oon as it &s;hould be di&s;covered, or to the hou&s;e of the phy&s;ician, whenever it might be done without danger, I yet could not help que&s;tioning whether to leave him to the mercy of per&s;ons, with whom I was unacquainted, that I might take a journey to vi&s;it the free and in|dependent electors of an Engli&s;h borough, were faithfully to fulfill the duties of hu|manity. Add to which the venerable and benevolent appearance of the &s;tran|ger was &s;o uncommonly intere&s;ting that it made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon my imagination.</P>
<P>But it was nece&s;&s;ary to decide, and I acted as mortals are obliged to do on &s;uch occa&s;ions: not knowing what was be&s;t, I adopted that which appeared to be the mo&s;t urgent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. THE JOURNEY TO THE BOROUGH OF THE BARO|NET. INDEPENDENT ELECTORS, AND THEIR MOTIVES SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED. EVIL COMMUNICATION CORRUPTS GOOD MANNERS. ELECTORS EAGER TO MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES, AND BEING ONCE BOUGHT WISH AGAIN TO BE BRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>THE following morning at the hour appointed, Sir Barnard and I &s;et off for the borough of * * * *: at which we arrived without delay or accident.</P>
<P>The number of voters was little more than thirty; and the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, after our arrival, was to invite them to a dinner.</P>
<P>It has long been remarked that men in a body will be guilty of actions of which individually they would each be a&s;hamed. In an a&s;&s;embly, however, the purpo&s;e of which is con&s;cious iniquity, few, who have not witne&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;cenes,
<PB N="71" REF="73">
will be aware of the efforts that each man will make to argue him&s;elf into a belief of his own upright intentions: or of the eager a&s;&s;ent with which his en|deavours will be &s;econded by his a&s;&s;o|ciates.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, for example, what were the motives of the worthy electors? Sir Barnard explained them, to the perfect &s;atisfaction of all parties.</P>
<P>But what were they? The love of the con&s;titution: the hone&s;t &s;truggles that hone&s;t men were making to di&s;place a corrupt mini&s;ter: their very eager and laudable attempts to free an oppre&s;&s;ed and ruined country, relieve it of its taxes, recover its trade, and revive the glory of old England: to effect the&s;e great and good purpo&s;es was the whole and &s;ole end at which they aimed. Were all the electors through all the boroughs, cities, and counties of Great Britain but as vir|tuous
<PB N="72" REF="74">
as tho&s;e of the borough of * * * *, it would indeed be a happy land.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;trange to &s;ay, what different ma&s;ks does &s;elf-a&s;&s;uming virtue wear! State the per contra. Imagine only how many free and independent electors were at this period exulting, in a &s;imilar man|ner, at the purity of their own conduct; while giving their votes for the &s;upport of government, the maintenance of order, and to pre&s;erve the immaculate &s;tate&s;|man, the &s;aviour of the nation, the great financier, the fir&s;t of orators, the admi|ration of Europe, and the wonder of the world, in power!</P>
<P>Who will deny that a general election is the &s;ea&s;on when all the di&s;intere&s;ted virtues, all the pure patrioti&s;m, all the mo&s;t generous and be&s;t qualities of the &s;oul are called into action? How are the morals of the people improved! To what a height of grandeur does human
<PB N="73" REF="75">
nature ri&s;e; and how captivating is the point of view in which it is &s;een! Aera of incomprehen&s;ible excellence!</P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that I, who was to be the repre&s;entative of &s;uch free and noble &s;ouls, through who&s;e lips their pa|triotic &s;pirits were to breathe, I, in whom one five hundredth part of the virtue of the whole i&s;land was to be compre&s;&s;ed, and bottled up ready for u&s;e, being as I was in company with &s;ages who&s;e office it was to choo&s;e one &s;till more &s;age than them&s;elves, thus circum&s;tanced, was it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould not imbibe &s;ome portion of their &s;ublime wi&s;dom? Had I no &s;ympathy? Were all my affections and pa&s;&s;ions and patrioti&s;m extinct?</P>
<P>Oh no! Mocking, &s;ays the proverb, is catching: and, however in my &s;ober moments, among &s;ober people, rea&s;oning on objects at a di&s;tance, I might &s;y&s;te|mati&s;e and legi&s;late for the conduct of my&s;elf and others, being an actor in the
<PB N="74" REF="76">
&s;cene, whether its atmo&s;phere were healthy or contagious, I never yet found that I could wholly e&s;cape imbibing a part of the effluvia. I gave toa&s;ts, made &s;peeches, &s;ung &s;ongs, ay and wrote them too, and became &s;o incorporated with my con&s;tituents, lovers as they were of li|berty, that, the cut of our cloaths and countenances excepted, I might in this moment of overflowing &s;apience have been taken for one of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I was little aware, however, when I con&s;ented to make this journey, of its con&s;equences. Di&s;intere&s;ted as the&s;e worthy voters were, and purcha&s;ed by whole&s;ale as they had been when the family of the Brays bought the borough, they yet had wives and daughters; who wore watches, and rings, and gowns; and who would each of them think them&s;elves &s;o flattered, by a genteel pre&s;ent from me, that there was no de|&s;cribing the plea&s;ure it would give them!
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Every <HI>particular</HI> about me told them I was very much of a gentleman.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide which, one lady had a great af|fection for a few pounds of the be&s;t green tea, bought in London. Another di&s;co|vered that the loaf &s;ugar in the country was abominable. A third could not but think that a few jars of India pickles, and pre&s;erved ginger, would be a very pretty pre&s;ent. It would always remind her of the giver. A fourth could not but &s;ay &s;he <HI>did</HI> long for a complete &s;uit of lace; cap, handkerchief, and ruffles: and &s;o on through the whole li&s;t.</P>
<P>The men too were troubled with their longings. With one it was London por|ter: with another it was Che&s;hire chee&s;e and bottled beer. They would both drink to the donor. Their neighbour longed very vehemently indeed for the hor&s;e I rode: and, finding that the animal was too great a favourite to be parted with,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
he compounded for twelve dozen of old port.</P>
<P>When the&s;e hints, which looked very like demands, were fir&s;t given me, I ap|plied to Sir Barnard; doubting much whether any of them ought to be com|plied with: but he let me under&s;tand that &s;uch things were politic, and cu&s;|tomary; and that a &s;eat in parliament, even when be&s;towed, was not to be had free of expence.</P>
<P>What could be done? To have re|quired him to pay the&s;e di&s;bur&s;ements would have had &s;o much the appearance of meanne&s;s, that it was what I could not propo&s;e. To reque&s;t a loan in advance of Mr. Evelyn was &s;ufficiently grating to the feelings: but he had a liberal &s;pirit, it was the lea&s;t painful of the two, and I had no other re&s;ource. Fortune was whetting the darts &s;he &s;oon intended to hurl.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. NEWS FROM MOWBRAY PETITIONING FOR AID. THE PERIOD OF UNIVERSAL UPROAR ARRIVES, AND THE BARONET PURSUES HIS PATRIOTIC PURPOSES. A FEW SKETCHES OF A COUNTY CONTEST AT A GENERAL ELECTION. HECTOR LOVING IN HIS LIQUOR. QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE, WHICH ARE THOUGHT VERY UNSEASONABLE AND VERY RIDICULOUS. THE INCOMPREHEN|SIBLE DEFECTION OF SIR BARNARD, AND THE SUSPICION THAT LIGHTS ON ME.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE we were &s;pending our time in this "plea&s;ant manner, and advantage|ou&s;ly to the Baronet's intere&s;t," we re|ceived intelligence of our quondam friends, the Earl and young Mowbray; who were canva&s;&s;ing the county, in which they had vowed oppo&s;ition to each other, with indefatigable zeal: &s;o that a ruinous conte&s;t, probably to both parties, was pre|dicted.</P>
<P>In this county Sir Barnard him&s;elf had &s;ome intere&s;t: for he had &s;ome lands
<PB N="78" REF="80">
there: and Hector prevailed on a com|mon friend to write in a very urgent &s;tyle to the Baronet, reque&s;ting his aid. How could &s;o great a lover of his country as Sir Barnard, indignant too as he felt him&s;elf at the apo&s;tacy of the Earl, refu&s;e a reque&s;t by which his own patriotic pur|po&s;es might be forwarded?</P>
<P>At length parliament was di&s;&s;olved; and the whole kingdom was immedi|ately in a tumult. Driving, rioting and uproar began. God help the poor po&s;t-hor&s;es, ho&s;tlers, and chambermaids!</P>
<P>The writ for the Baronet's borough was made out, his agents were ready, and, as there could be no oppo&s;ition, our bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon over. It was high time: for my pocket was tolerably drained. And as the worthy electors very indu&s;triou&s;ly compared notes, when any one of them di&s;covered that the pre&s;ent made to his neighbour was of greater value than the <HI>compliment</HI> which he had received, I had
<PB N="79" REF="81">
immediate intimation of my own inju&s;|tice: which it was expected I &s;hould correct.</P>
<P>This &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ettled, and the&s;e accounts clo&s;ed, the Baronet now had lei&s;ure to think of his friends; and he turned his thoughts to the annoying of Lord Idford. He had purcha&s;ed me as well as his borough: for he had made me his own member, and meant to profit by me in all po&s;&s;ible ways. He had di&s;co|vered my electioneering talents. I was very engaging among the women: a mat|ter of no &s;mall moment in &s;uch affairs: and, "though I was rather &s;hy of my gla&s;s, yet I could &s;ing an excellent &s;ong, which I could likewi&s;e make, quite &s;uita|ble to the occa&s;ion." He therefore pro|po&s;ed that we &s;hould both journey into my native county, and there exerci&s;e all our wit and ingenuity, to aid in bringing in my old &s;chool-fellow, Hector.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that, in an affair
<PB N="80" REF="82">
where the family and the brother of Oli|via were &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly implicated, I could be totally unconcerned. With re&s;pect to the que&s;tion of who was the mo&s;t vir|tuous, or the mo&s;t wife, who the greate&s;t orator, the be&s;t patriot, or the propere&s;t per&s;on to take a &s;eat among the grand na|tional council of &s;ages, the Earl or the 'Squire, that was not ea&s;ily determined. It was a point therefore that did not di&s;|quiet my con&s;cience. My compliance was con&s;equently given with a hearty good will; and we both prepared for the holy work.</P>
<P>How it happened that the vice which inevitably attaches it&s;elf to &s;uch conduct, &s;elf-evident gro&s;s and glaring as it is, fa|tal to private morals and public virtue, odious in its practice and helli&s;h in its con&s;equences, how the baneful com|plexion of this mon&s;ter vice &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;o totally e&s;cape me is more than I can declare. Hurry of thought, confu&s;ion
<PB N="81" REF="83">
of intellect, and eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion are the only probable conjectures I can make. My mind was &s;o intent on the manner in which I could be&s;t prove my re&s;pect for Olivia, and all that related to her, that this appears to have been a gulph va&s;t enough for all recollection, &s;en&s;e, and idea!</P>
<P>A po&s;t-chai&s;e and four &s;oon brought us to the field of battle; and then I own my blood began to circulate, and my feelings to awaken. Still it was but gra|dually that my &s;pirits mounted to the pro|per tone.</P>
<P>Before we entered the place where the election was to be held, we heard the jangling of bells and the &s;houts of men. The po&s;tillions &s;pared neither whip nor &s;pur; and, as we galloped furi|ou&s;ly along the &s;treets, the people came &s;warming out: the women and children &s;aluting us with their &s;hrill trebles; and, it being dark, the men crowding to fol|low
<PB N="82" REF="84">
with torches and more &s;onorous hub|bub. Every inn was a &s;cene of confu|&s;ion. When we drove up to that which was the head-quarters of Hector, his par|ti&s;ans immediately flocked round us, and, a courier having previou&s;ly announced our arrival, &s;aluted Sir Barnard with all the force of lungs they could heave: elated in proportion to the uproar they made.</P>
<P>The 'Squire and his friends, vociferous though they were, and heated with anti|cipated triumphs wine and wa&s;&s;ail, heard the glorious din, learned its cau&s;e, and came reeling forth to embrace their pui&s;|&s;ant ally. Quitting as they did the fumes of buttocks and &s;irloins, gammons and hams, turkies and gee&s;e, wines, brandies, beers and tobacco, they all came reeking; each involved in his own atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Their joy was boi&s;terous, and not to be repul&s;ed. Hector was as drunk as the animal that brought the royal David his
<PB N="83" REF="85">
&s;ucking pigs; and as loving as the mon|&s;ter in the Tempe&s;t. He could not in|deed cur&s;e &s;o poetically: but what he wanted in variety he &s;upplied by repeti|tion; and his oaths and his raptures were countle&s;s.</P>
<P>He be&s;towed a part of them upon me: for, not only did fea&s;ting make him fond, but, he had ju&s;t memory enough left to recollect that I was now become an M. P. and he was not quite &s;ure whether, till he had gained his election, I might not at pre&s;ent be almo&s;t as great a man as him&s;elf. I was moreover his election|eering friend: which virtue would, for a fortnight to come, be ine&s;timable.</P>
<P>I had been di&s;gu&s;ted with the eating and drinking required at the ready-bought borough of ****: but that was ab&s;ti|nence it&s;elf, compared to the &s;cene in which I had con&s;ented to become an actor. Away the Baronet and I were dragged,
<PB N="84" REF="86">
by the mo&s;t jovial crew: Hector our lead|er, and &s;eating him&s;elf in &s;tate at our head.</P>
<P>"Clean gla&s;&s;es!" bellowed the hero; and, &s;eizing his own, &s;ma&s;hed it again&s;t the wall: commanding us to follow his noble example. Midway drunkenne&s;s di&s;dains to think: all arms were rai&s;ed, and de&s;truction was impending. Fortu|nately, there were two &s;ober men in company; and, &s;eeing what had happen|ed, we both loudly called&mdash;"Forbear!" "You have cut one of the waiters," added I; addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Hector, and pointing to a man who&s;e face was &s;mear|ed with blood. "Damn him!" retorted the brave Hector. "Put him down in the bill." The mighty man was plea&s;ed at his own &s;econd-hand wit; and, as an old joke is the &s;oone&s;t under&s;tood, they all joined in the laugh.</P>
<P>Eager to make the new comers wel|come, that is as drunk as him&s;elf, Hector
<PB N="85" REF="87">
in&s;i&s;ted that the Baronet and I &s;hould drink three bumpers each; and, as the fatigue of travelling had rendered this no difficult ta&s;k, we complied.</P>
<P>He then &s;wore we would <HI>&s;et to</HI> for the night; but I perceived that his night would not be a long one. Toa&s;ts were called for, however, and liquor was &s;wal|lowed, till its vapours half deprived the redoubted Hector of the faculty of &s;peech. At this period, he began to mutter non&s;en&s;e, on a &s;ubject on which I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed with his &s;ilence than his prai&s;e. He made the lovely Olivia his theme; and in the ful|ne&s;s, not of his heart, but, of his &s;tomach, told me how dearly &s;he loved me&mdash;"Yes, my boy, &s;he does, by G&mdash;! And &s;he's right! Damn me, &s;he's right! I &s;ay it; by G&mdash;, my boy, &s;he's right! You are my friend!&mdash;You are my friend, and &s;he's right. And as for Lord ki&s;s&mdash;damn me, he's a &s;neaking &s;coundrel! I &s;ay it,
<PB N="86" REF="88">
a &s;neaking&mdash;! So &s;he's right! Damn me, &s;he's right!"</P>
<P>He continued to repeat his oaths, and "She's right," till, entirely overpowered, be &s;unk; and would have dropped from his chair, if the waiter whom he had cut with the gla&s;s had not caught him. Some of the gue&s;ts had withdrawn, &s;ome were &s;leeping, and &s;ome were &s;en&s;ele&s;s: but the few who could open their eyes, and &s;ee to &s;uch a di&s;tance, triumphed in the defeat of their leader: which they con&s;idered as victory to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Riot now pau&s;ed per force. The Ba|ronet pleaded fatigue, and retired. I followed his example, and once more found my&s;elf alone; left to ruminate on the methods which men take to make each other happy; on their different modes of happine&s;s, in their different &s;tations: and on waiters who, being maimed or killed, are to be charged in the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">Though the&s;e thoughts were not of the mo&s;t delightful kind, they did not prevent me from &s;leeping. The new day brought new cares; and pre&s;ented projects, in which I was required to take my part, that led me to very &s;erious me|ditations indeed. The poll was to begin that day week; and Hector and his friends, rou&s;ed from the torpor of over|loaded revelry by the importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s, a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ider how they &s;hould be&s;t collect and mar&s;hal the voters of whom they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be certain, and cajole and bring over &s;uch as they imagined might be gained.</P>
<P>Of this labour each man was to take his allotted &s;hare; and direct bribery was openly propo&s;ed as the general me|dium by which the great end in que&s;tion was to be promoted.</P>
<P>This was what I had not fore&s;een. I was not only young but, as I have before remarked, I had thought but little on the
<PB N="88" REF="90">
affair: except as it continually pre&s;ented the image of Olivia to my mind. I now found my&s;elf mo&s;t painfully &s;ituated. I had di&s;covered principles of human con|duct in which I had gloried. I had a&s;|&s;erted them un&s;paringly; and had promi&s;ed my&s;elf that from them I would never de|part. In doubtful ca&s;es, I might decide and act erroneou&s;ly: but, when the way was clear, my conduct &s;hould be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles I was required to abandon; and the &s;hock was &s;evere. The tran&s;actions which had lately pa&s;&s;ed in the Baronet's borough increa&s;ed the difficulty. In what light could the pre|&s;ents that I had made be con&s;idered? In what were they different from and how much better than bribes? To the&s;e I had &s;ubmitted when my own intere&s;t was in que&s;tion. Again: for what pur|po&s;e had I con&s;ented to accompany Sir Barnard, if not to exert my&s;elf in favour
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of his friend? And not only his friend but the brother of Olivia; though this was a &s;ilent grief, known only to my&s;elf. However I &s;tated my &s;cruples: which, as &s;oon as they were heard, were the &s;ubject of laughter. I repeated them in a &s;till more &s;erious tone, and was re|minded of the facts, and motives which I have ju&s;t been mentioning.</P>
<P>The &s;truggle was violent. The ar|guments I had to urge were &s;omething like in&s;ults, on every body pre&s;ent that heard me; and I was an&s;wered &s;ome|times with ridicule, at others with anger, and not unfrequently with &s;omething very like contempt.</P>
<P>The Baronet in particular augured very unfavourably, concerning the &s;ub|&s;erviency which he expected from me; and once or twice &s;poke in a very dicta|torial tone: but, finding him&s;elf an&s;wer|ed with no little indignation, he had no remedy but to chew the cud in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">A&s;&s;ailed on all &s;ides, as it happened I had the good &s;en&s;e, in de&s;pite of every mockery and in&s;inuation, to remain firm; and the only part I could be prevailed upon to take determinately was that of aiding in a fair and open canvas, leaving tho&s;e who were le&s;s con&s;cientious to di&s;|tribute bribes. As it was imagined however that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome abilities, my &s;ervices were accepted on my own conditions.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the wa&s;te that was com|mitted, the bribes that were paid, and the money that was &s;quandered in every way, as well in London, where voters were eagerly purcha&s;ed and &s;ent down by coach loads, as in di&s;tant parts of the county and kingdom, convinced me that the &s;ums which this election would co&s;t mu&s;t be enormous. I even thought it my duty to take an opportunity, in one of Hector's half &s;ober moments, to re|mon&s;trate with all the arguments and
<PB N="91" REF="93">
energy I could collect; and endeavoured to per&s;uade him to decline the poll. But my efforts were u&s;ele&s;s. He was equally vain of his wealth and his influence. His pur&s;e perhaps was as deep as that of the proud peer; his friends as nume|rous; and he would carry his election though he were to mortgage every foot of land he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Finding him re&s;olved, I became an|xious in his behalf, &s;trained every nerve, rode in all directions night and day, and &s;o effectually exerted my&s;elf in enquir|ing who were the independent men likely to be influenced by hone&s;t mo|tives, that I procured him above fifty votes.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to him&s;elf, the continual drinking, vociferating, and riot of the &s;cene had made him &s;o hoar&s;e that, pre|vious to the day of election, his hu&s;ky whi&s;pers were not audible.</P>
<P>The evening before the poll opened, an incident occurred for which, at that
<PB N="92" REF="94">
time, I knew not how to account. It was no le&s;s amazing than incomprehen|&s;ible. I had returned very much fa|tigued, after hard riding, and found a me&s;&s;age had been left for me by Sir Barnard; who de&s;ired to &s;peak with me immediately.</P>
<P>I obeyed the &s;ummons, and found him alone. He opened the conver&s;ation in a &s;trange blu&s;tering tone: complaining of having been neglected, or in&s;ulted; he did not &s;eem to know which; and, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, declared his &s;atisfac|tion at the &s;cruples which I had profe&s;&s;ed. He knew not what to &s;ay to &s;uch cor|rupt proceedings. Perhaps an hone&s;t man ought to have no concern in them; and, for his own part, he certainly &s;hould trouble him&s;elf no farther on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. He had met with but little thanks for what he had already done; and he had come to a re&s;olution not to bring up his voters.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">Acquainted with the corrupt arts by which the promi&s;es of the&s;e voters, ge|nerally &s;peaking, had been gained, I knew not what to reply: though I felt no little chagrin. With the aid of Sir Barnard, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that Mowbray's election would certainly have been car|ried: but without that aid I was per|&s;uaded it would as certainly be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>This opinion I forcibly repeated: ad|ding that, though elections like the&s;e were de&s;tructive beyond de&s;cription to the general happine&s;s, and though I could not defend having taken any part whatever in one of them, yet the mi&s;|chief in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance had already been done. If Sir Barnard had re|ceived any in&s;ult, or even &s;uffered any neglect, I intreated that he would permit me to be the mediator, and &s;tate his griefs: being per&s;uaded, from all I had &s;een, that nothing injurious to his per&s;on or his intere&s;t had been intended.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">His an&s;wers were eva&s;ive. He acted as men frequently do, who have &s;ome &s;e|cret purpo&s;e which they dare not avow: he affected that wa&s;pi&s;h irritation of tem|per to which he was &s;ubject &s;o many oc|ca&s;ions; but on none &s;o frequently as when he &s;u&s;pected him&s;elf to be wrong.</P>
<P>While we were in the heat of this di&s;|cour&s;e, a chai&s;e and four drove up to the door. It was for the Baronet. His trunk and mine were both prepared, by his orders. The men were buckling the former behind the carriage; and he re|que&s;ted me to accompany him to town.</P>
<P>I was thunder&s;truck! I could neither account for &s;uch &s;ullen intemperance nor the &s;ecrecy of this ha&s;te. I again urgent|ly intreated I might acquaint Mr. Mow|bray, and his committee: but he per|emptorily refu&s;ed, and repeated his de|&s;ire that I would accompany him imme|diately. No arguments, no prayers, could move him: &s;o that, at la&s;t, I ha&s;tily left
<PB N="95" REF="97">
the room, in &s;earch of Hector and his friends.</P>
<P>He gue&s;&s;ed my intention, and as &s;oon as I was gone &s;tepped into the chai&s;e and ordered the boys to drive away full &s;peed: leaving me behind to act as I &s;hould think proper; but with a me&s;&s;age that, if I wi&s;hed to oblige him, I mu&s;t mount my hor&s;e and ride after him with all ex|pedition. I might overtake him at the next inn; and our &s;ervants and hor&s;es would then follow at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before I could find Mowbray, or any of his party. They were at another inn, promoting the good cau&s;e; and, when I informed them of the intentions of Sir Barnard, they &s;carce|ly could believe me: but, when they heard the chai&s;e was at the door, they hurried with me; full of anxiety and di&s;|may. We were too late. Sir Barnard was gone: long out of hearing, and out of &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">The con&s;ternation was extreme. Stu|pefied as his faculties were, for a moment Hector was rou&s;ed. Conjectures were formed, but none pre&s;ented them&s;elves that could account for &s;uch extraordina|ry conduct. No one knew of any of|fence that had been given the Baronet. It was remarked indeed, on recollection, that the la&s;t day or two he had not te&s;ti|fied the &s;ame alacrity and zeal: but no man could gue&s;s his motive.</P>
<P>At length the indignation of Hector took vent in a volley of cur&s;es, which were plentifully and emphatically be|&s;towed. And &s;o keenly was the &s;troke felt, that he put a very unu&s;ual quantity, &s;mall though it was, of variety in his oaths. Not only the body and blood of Sir Barnard, but his liver, eyes, and heart, were con&s;igned over to Satan.</P>
<P>Even I, though I had procured votes di&s;tinct from the intere&s;t of the Baronet, and had refu&s;ed to follow him to town,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
in which refu&s;al I per&s;i&s;ted, &s;till I did not e&s;cape &s;u&s;picion. No direct allegation was made: but the que&s;tions that were put to me were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of doubt.</P>
<P>The irritated mind is apt at error; and I di&s;dained to make a per&s;onal applica|tion of the guilt by which I knew my&s;elf uncontaminated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. THE OPENING OF THE POLL. MY FIRST ESSAY AT PUBLIC ORATORY. THE GENERAL FEELINGS OF MEN IN FAVOUR OF VIRTUE, THOUGH CON|TRADICTED BY THEIR PRACTICE. THE HATE|FUL SPECTACLE OF A CORRUPT ELECTION, AND MORE CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST THE BARONET. A FALSE ACCUSATION RESENTED.</HEAD>
<P>PASSION di&s;pels pa&s;&s;ion, and care com|bats care. Sir Barnard was gone, dili|gence was the more nece&s;&s;ary, and pre|parations
<PB N="98" REF="100">
for the approaching day would not admit of neglect. It may well be &s;aid that circum&s;tances and &s;ituation make the man. Hector, who had no habitual capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s or intellect for order, was in&s;pired by the occa&s;ion with a degree of talent of which at other times he was incapable. The fatigue he underwent was exce&s;&s;ive; and, impo&s;&s;i|ble as it was that he &s;hould create any &s;trong &s;ympathy, I &s;till felt &s;ome intere&s;t in his behalf; and &s;ome alarm at the fixed hoar&s;ene&s;s by which his lungs were threatened, and the alteration which in|ce&s;&s;ant drinking and unu&s;ual efforts had produced in his appearance.</P>
<P>The night was pa&s;&s;ed with more than ordinary tumult. It was late before the riotous gue&s;ts departed; and our re&s;t was &s;hort. The day of beginning conte&s;t &s;oon broke upon us, the word of com|mand was given to mu&s;ter and all was in action. The friends of the oppo&s;ing
<PB N="99" REF="101">
parties collected, each round their re&s;pec|tive leaders: favours for the hat and bo&s;om were lavi&s;hly di&s;tributed: the flags were flying: a band of mu&s;ic pre|ceded each of the proce&s;&s;ions: and, when the parties approached the hu&s;t|ings, each band continued to play its own favourite air with increa&s;ing vio|lence: as if war were to be declared by the mo&s;t jarring di&s;cord, and harmony driven from the haunts of men.</P>
<P>The grating &s;ounds were increa&s;ed by ballad &s;ingers, marrowbones and cleavers, and the vociferous throats of men who &s;eemed to imagine that, if they were but &s;ufficiently noi&s;y, they could not fail of being victorious.</P>
<P>The &s;caffolding was mounted, the can|didates appeared, and mouths, ears, and eyes were open; for the reception of all the wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m, with all the <HI>comicality</HI> and <HI>fun,</HI> which the orators were expected to be&s;tow. A mob delights in
<PB N="100" REF="102">
being harangued; and is thrown into raptures by every kind of mountebank.</P>
<P>Jealous perhaps of his own honor, the god of eloquence decreed that neither the wit nor the wi&s;dom of Hector &s;hould that day be heard. He was too hoar&s;e for any effort to make him audible: but, as &s;tir|ring and ambitious &s;pirits on &s;uch occa|&s;ions are always abroad, tongues were not wanting to trumpet forth his high de|&s;erts.</P>
<P>The candidates for oratorical fame were &s;everal. I was of the number: and, as the glo&s;s of my newly acquired digni|ty dazzled other eyes as well as my own, I was permitted to take the lead. It was my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay; and I felt a momentary alarm: but, full of youthful &s;pirits and high in blood, I da&s;hed forward; and uttered what fir&s;t occurred.</P>
<P>My voice was powerful, my non&s;en&s;e was applauded, my fears vani&s;hed, and I became more collected. The real griev|ances
<PB N="101" REF="103">
of mankind, under the be&s;t govern|ment that ever yet exi&s;ted, have at all times been &s;o numerous that an orator, who makes them his theme, is never in want of facts and arguments.</P>
<P>Could I then feel this deficiency at an epocha like the one in que&s;tion: when means &s;o de&s;potic were daily adopted to curb the growing &s;pirit of enquiry that de&s;pot mini&s;ters might pur&s;ue mea&s;ures &s;o tragical; &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of the order which they pretended to maintain, and &s;o de&s;tructive to the happine&s;s they were appointed to guard? Alas! the topics were &s;o numerous, &s;o melancholy, &s;o al|mo&s;t maddening, that the man who would paint them truly mu&s;t temper and rein-in his feelings with an iron arm: otherwi&s;e, imagination will &s;o hurry him away that, while de&s;cribing evils pa&s;t, evils pre&s;ent, and evils impending, there is danger of his being deemed an incendiary.</P>
<P>I &s;poke ill. When I remembered what

I had &s;aid, and what I might and ought to have &s;aid, I was indignant at my own want of recollection. The applau&s;e that I re|ceived neverthele&s;s was prodigious: the acclamations of the mob were even aw|ful. They di&s;played a feeling of ju&s;tice &s;o acute, &s;o prompt, and &s;o powerful, that I was borne out of my&s;elf; and ima|gined for a moment, not merely that the day of reform was at hand, but that it was come.</P>
<P>Men are rendered &s;elfi&s;h, and corrupt, by the baneful influence of the &s;y&s;tems under which they live: but it is well worthy the attention of tho&s;e who believe mankind to be generally capable of great happine&s;s, and who are de&s;irous to pro|mote it, that, however the wants of the wretched may tempt them to accept the immediate relief that is within their reach, they never collectively fail to be&s;tow the mo&s;t unbounded applau&s;e, on tho&s;e prin|ciples by which their own proceedings
<PB N="103" REF="105">
are condemned. They are not in love with ba&s;ene&s;s: it is forced upon them.</P>
<P>The reader is doubtle&s;s aware that Hector and his friends a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves the merit of what is called the in|dependent intere&s;t; and that his oppo|nent was &s;upported by the whole in|fluence of the court party. The nume|rous groans and hi&s;&s;es, and the few plau|dits, be&s;towed upon the orators of this party, were additional proofs of what is the general &s;en&s;e of mankind; and that on the &s;ubject of corrupt influence at lea&s;t they judge rightly. In this gene|ral &s;en&s;e I own that my &s;oul triumphed: and the pangs which I felt, after the poll began, to perceive that, whatever men might think, they could forget their du|ty and vote only as their intere&s;t directed, were unde&s;cribable.</P>
<P>However, the party of Hector was &s;trong. The &s;truggle was violent. Every &s;candalous art of election was re&s;orted to,
<PB N="104" REF="106">
by both &s;ides. A &s;pirit of rancour daily and hourly increa&s;ed. The opponents came to frequent blows. Bea&s;tly drunk|enne&s;s, bloated in&s;olence, and profligacy of principle, met the eye on every &s;ide; and I almo&s;t hated my&s;elf, not only for being pre&s;ent at and participating in it, but, to find that I belonged to a race of animals capable of &s;uch foul and dete&s;ta|ble vice.</P>
<P>From this di&s;tre&s;s I was relieved by an event which in it&s;elf was very far from &s;atisfactory. The poll had proceeded for &s;ome days with tolerable equality; and Hector had rather the advantage: though the voters in the intere&s;t of Sir Barnard had not given him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; to which they had frequently been urged. At length, they appeared. And how great was the &s;urpri&s;e and indignation of our whole party, to &s;ee them mar&s;halled on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, with the favours of the Idford candidate in their hats,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
and uniformly come up and poll again&s;t us!</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, twelve of the votes which had been promi&s;ed to me were likewi&s;e brought over to the oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;t; and ten more of them refu&s;ed to poll for either party.</P>
<P>The coincidence of this de&s;ertion re|vived the &s;u&s;picions of Hector and his party, concerning me. This &s;udden turn of the poll again&s;t him rendered his temper ungovernable; and, in the fren|zy of pa&s;&s;ion, he made no &s;cruple of openly affirming that I was no le&s;s guilty than the Baronet.</P>
<P>It was not merely the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence that I felt. I had been &s;o in|defatigable in every po&s;&s;ible way, I had ridden and walked and talked, I had been his defender, his eulogi&s;t, his ora|tor, his &s;lave, and had as it were &s;o fouled my con&s;cience in his cau&s;e that indigna|tion clo&s;ed my lips. I di&s;dained reply,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
or &s;elf vindication; and, ca&s;ting a glance &s;uch as irre&s;i&s;tible feeling dictated, left the committee room in which the accu&s;a|tion was made without an&s;wering a word.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. THE RETURN TO TOWN. A VISIT TO SIR BER|NARD. ADMISSION DENIED. ENQUIRIES AF|TER THE WOUNDED STRANGER, WHO HAD DIS|APPEARED. AN ENDEAVOUR TO GUARD AGAINST MISREPRESENTATION. THE FEARS AND FEEL|INGS OF FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>MY determination was taken, my &s;er|vant was called, my hor&s;es ordered, and I immediately departed for London. My thoughts were far from being clear, or of a plea&s;ant kind. The &s;cene I had left was the mo&s;t odious that I had ever be|held. Hector I was convinced would lo&s;e his election; and, what was more valuable, his health. I &s;aw progno&s;tics
<PB N="107" REF="109">
which I thought could not be mi&s;taken; and which afterward proved as baleful as I then imagined them to be. Whether the conte&s;t might not ruin the family was more than I knew; and what the effect might be on Olivia, and even on our hoped for union, I could not fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>The enigmatical conduct of Sir Bar|nard was no le&s;s perplexing. His &s;udden de&s;ertion of Hector, and of the cau&s;e which he had &s;o loudly defended, were alarming. For what other interpreta|tion could be put upon the voters in the Baronet's intere&s;t, who not only refu&s;ed to poll according to their promi&s;e, but were all of them brought up in &s;upport of the Idford candidate? Yet I was loth to conclude that an event &s;o fatal to all my hopes, as well to my private affec|tions as to my public duties, had taken place.</P>
<P>My hor&s;es were excellent, and carried us &s;eventy miles in le&s;s time than it would
<PB N="108" REF="110">
have taken to go po&s;t. I intended to have ordered a chai&s;e for the remainder of the way: but a mail coach was to pa&s;s in half an hour, and I waited. There hap|pened to be a vacancy in which I &s;eated my&s;elf; and by the&s;e means I arrived in town early in the morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the day was far enough ad|vanced, my fir&s;t care was to vi&s;it Sir Bar|nard; and I own I approached the &s;treet and the hou&s;e with a foreboding heart. What had happened could not be unin|tentional. It was too decided, too ab|rupt, and had too many marks of un|principled treachery. I knocked, made my enquiries, and was informed the Ba|ronet was not at home. I a&s;ked for Lady Bray; and not at home was again the an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>As this was what I apprehended, it ex|cited but little &s;urpri&s;e, though much vexation. However I left my card; and departed more full of meditation even
<PB N="109" REF="111">
than I came. Not at home I had no doubt &s;ignified that my vi&s;its were no longer welcome.</P>
<P>Still it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould know the truth; and, as I had been too inti|mate with the family to be ignorant of the haunts of Sir Barnard, I went to the Cocoa tree, a place to which he daily re|&s;orted, and there lounged away between two and three hours over the papers; hoping he would come.</P>
<P>I was again di&s;appointed. The Baro|net did not make his appearance; and I began to conjecture that perhaps the &s;ervant had told me truly: he might be out early; on bu&s;ine&s;s, or I knew not what.</P>
<P>As it was pa&s;t his hour at the Cocoa tree, perhaps I &s;hould now find him at home. I therefore went back; and again made my enquiries, and again received the &s;ame dry laconic an&s;wer. It had an ill face: but I had no immediate remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">My next mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing object of atten|tion was the wounded &s;tranger; whom I had left under the care of the phy&s;ician, and whom I immediately determined to enquire after: not without &s;ome &s;ilent reproaches to my&s;elf, for having &s;o long been ab&s;ent on &s;chemes &s;uch as tho&s;e in which I had been concerned, to the ne|glect of perhaps a more &s;erious duty. For duty &s;eemed to require that men &s;hould rather ab&s;tain from elections, &s;uch as they are at pre&s;ent, than become aiders and abettors of them.</P>
<P>My hor&s;es not being arrived, and di&s;|liking the vehicle of a hackney coach, I walked forward to the inn at which the &s;tranger had been left; mu&s;ing much on the pro&s;pect before me, which was once more beginning to be heavily overca&s;t.</P>
<P>Being come to my journey's end, I found the &s;tranger had been removed two days after I left him to London: but the people of the inn could give me
<PB N="111" REF="113">
no farther intelligence, concerning him or the place of his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked them to direct me to the hou&s;e of the phy&s;ician: which they did, but told me that he had left the king|dom.</P>
<P>Determined however to make every po&s;&s;ible enquiry, I went to the hou&s;e; where I found only a per&s;on who was left in charge of the premi&s;es, and who knew nothing more than that the phy|&s;ician was gone with a patient to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The&s;e little incidents, trifling as they appeared, afforded me an excellent proof of the ab&s;urdity of fal&s;e mode&s;ty: which induces men, from the egoi&s;tical fear of being thought vain, to conceal or di&s;|gui&s;e the truth. The phy&s;ician had be|&s;towed high eulogiums on my humanity: after which, he had hinted a de&s;ire, but with well-bred re&s;erve, to know who I was; and I, catching the apparent de|licacy of his feelings and thinking but
<PB N="112" REF="114">
very little on the &s;ubject, imagined there would be o&s;tentation in per&s;onally taking to my&s;elf his prai&s;es, by giving him my name and place of abode. I therefore told him I would an&s;wer that que&s;tion when we became better acquainted; if he &s;hould then find he had no rea&s;on to alter his good opinion of me.</P>
<P>Thus do men by affecting not to be vain, indulge a kind of double refined vanity; and lead them&s;elves and others into error.</P>
<P>Being di&s;appointed in all my enquiries of this day, my next care was to &s;ee Mi&s;s Wilmot. Surrounded as I was by per|&s;ons who thought me inimical to them, and therefore were probably my inveterate enemies, I knew not what fal&s;e reports might be &s;pread; nor how to guard again&s;t them in the public opinion. But I had one con&s;olation. Olivia had declared &s;he was re&s;olved to enquire, before &s;he again gave the lea&s;t credit to calumny.
<PB N="113" REF="115">
It was therefore e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould acquaint Mi&s;s Wilmot with all that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was now evening; and, when I came to her lodgings, I found her brother and Turl both there. Though my ab|&s;ence had been &s;hort, the meeting gave me no little plea&s;ure. It would likewi&s;e &s;ave me the trouble of a thrice told tale: for to friends like the&s;e my heart was always open; and I had &s;omething like an abhorrence of concealment, and &s;ecret tran&s;actions. I wi&s;hed them to &s;hare in all my joys; and, as to my griefs, they not only excited their &s;ympathy but pro|duced remarks and coun&s;el, by which they had often been cured.</P>
<P>I told my &s;tory; and it may well be imagined my hearers were neither in|attentive nor unmoved. The &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and depravity into which men are driven, and the vices of which being thus im|pelled they are capable, exemplified as
<PB N="114" REF="116">
the&s;e vices were in my narration, drew heavy &s;ighs from the gentle and kind hearted Lydia, made her much oppre&s;&s;ed brother groan in &s;pirit, and excited in Turl tho&s;e comprehen&s;ive powers that trace the hi&s;tory of facts through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and teach, by mi&s;eries that are pa&s;t, how mi&s;eries in future are to be avoided.</P>
<P>The general feeling however was that danger was hovering over me. The in|dignation of Wilmot, at the treatment of men who mo&s;t endeavoured to de|&s;erve well of their age and country, was very &s;trong.</P>
<P>Neither was Turl le&s;s moved. His manner was placid, yet his feelings were acute. But, though they might vibrate for a moment toward di&s;cord, they touch|ed the true harmony at la&s;t. He who has fixed principles of action is &s;oon call|ed to a recollection of his duties, and the manner in which he ought to act.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">Rou&s;ed by his friend&s;hip for me, I &s;hould rather &s;ay by his affection, he collected his faculties; and pre&s;ented to the imagination &s;o &s;ublime a picture of fortitude, and of the virtue of enduring injuries and oppre&s;&s;ion with dignity, that he prepared my mind mo&s;t admirably for the trials that were to &s;ucceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A SECOND AND MORE SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BARONET. AN ENIGMATICAL DIALOGUE: THE MEANING OF WHICH HOWEVER MAY BE GUESSED.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not only the wi&s;h of my heart but it was quite nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ee Mr. Evelyn. However, it was exceed|ingly de&s;irable that I &s;hould previou&s;ly meet the Baronet: left, in what I &s;hould &s;ay, my &s;urmi&s;es might be fal&s;e; and I might produce a family di&s;agreement be|tween
<PB N="116" REF="118">
per&s;ons who would both have con|ferred e&s;&s;ential benefits on me, if the &s;up|po&s;ed defection of Sir Barnard &s;hould not be true. I determined therefore once more to go to the Cocoa tree and wait.</P>
<P>As it happened, waiting was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The Baronet was there; and, though there was &s;omething of coldne&s;s in his manner, it was by no means what my fears had taught me to expect. Salu|tation having pa&s;&s;ed, I reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him. We retired into a private room; and he began by telling me he was glad to &s;ee me again in town; and no longer continuing to &s;upport a per|&s;on whom he no longer e&s;teemed his friend.</P>
<P>At hearing this remark, and the &s;igni|ficance with which it was delivered, my evil augury returned upon me in full force. I an&s;wered that I had quitted Mr. Mowbray not becau&s;e I had de&s;erted his
<PB N="117" REF="119">
intere&s;t, but becau&s;e I had been unju&s;tly accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Accu&s;ed of what, Mr. Trevor?"</P>
<P>"Of having been influenced by you to betray a party which I had pretended to e&s;pou&s;e."</P>
<P>"And were you not influenced by me, Mr. Trevor?"</P>
<P>"I never can be influenced by any man, Sir Barnard, to commit an action which my heart condemns."</P>
<P>"Do you mean, Mr. Trevor, that your heart condemns me?"</P>
<P>"The que&s;tion is very direct; and I am not de&s;irous of wounding your feel|ings, Sir Barnard: but I mu&s;t not be guilty of fal&s;ehood. I certainly wi&s;h you had acted otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then you pretend to &s;et up for your&s;elf, Mr. Trevor; and to have no deference whatever for me, and my opi|nions."</P>
<P>"Per&s;onally, as a gentleman who
<PB N="118" REF="120">
meant to do me &s;ervice, I wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve every re&s;pect for you, Sir Barnard. But I hope you do not expect of me any deference that &s;hould, on any occa&s;ion whatever, induce me to abandon either my public or my private duties."</P>
<P>"Very well, Mr. Trevor. Very well. I dare &s;ay you are &s;o perfectly acquainted with your duties that no man on earth, not even he who had been your greate&s;t friend, could induce you to alter any of your notions."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould hope, Sir Barnard, that either friend or enemy might &s;o induce me: provided he had truth and rea&s;on on his &s;ide."</P>
<P>"Very well, Mr. Trevor. All that is very fine. I dare &s;ay you under&s;tand your own intere&s;t, and will take your own road: even though you might if you plea&s;ed travel more at your ca&s;e, and in better company, by going another way."</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">"Will you be kind enough to explain your&s;elf, Sir Barnard?"</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Trevor. I &s;hall give no explanations, till I am &s;ure I am talking to my friend: my fa&s;t friend, Mr. Tre|vor: that will think and act with me. If you will give me your word and honor as a gentleman to that, why then we will talk together."</P>
<P>"If by thinking and acting together, Sir Barnard, you mean that you expect I &s;hould blindly and implicitly conform to any tergiver&s;ation&mdash;I mean to any change&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You need explain your&s;elf no farther, Mr. Trevor. I very well under&s;tand your meaning. My friend is my friend, Mr. Trevor; and he is no other man's friend, Mr. Trevor. I could not but &s;uppo&s;e you under&s;tood all that perfectly at fir&s;t; and I am very &s;orry to be &s;o much deceived. But it is my misfortune
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to be always deceived, and entrapped; and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Entrapped, Sir Barnard! I hope you do not apply that word to me?"</P>
<P>"Nay, nay, Mr. Trevor, I want no quarrelling."</P>
<P>"Nor do I, Sir Barnard. But, if you &s;uppo&s;e me capable of taking any advan|tage of what you may now think an ill-placed confidence in me, you egregiou&s;ly mi&s;take both my intentions and my cha|racter."</P>
<P>"I hope I do, Mr. Trevor. You have a great fluency: but I hope I do."</P>
<P>I &s;aw him preparing to go; and, being exceedingly anxious to have a determinate an&s;wer, I added&mdash;"Let me intreat you, Sir Barnard, to give me an explicit decla|ration of what you expect from me?"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Mr. Trevor. I &s;hall &s;ay no more, at pre&s;ent. You &s;ay I mi&s;take your intentions. I hope I do.

<P>WELL might I forebode the approach of evil: and, except that complaint is of no avail, is wa&s;te of time, is unhappine&s;s and therefore is immoral, well might I complain of tho&s;e &s;udden &s;trokes of fate by which, whenever my pro&s;pects began to be flattering, they were &s;uddenly ob|&s;cured in darkne&s;s and de&s;pair. But, if I had not &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf marked in an

extraordinary manner as the child of for|tune, to who&s;e &s;miles and frowns I &s;eemed to be capriciou&s;ly &s;ubjected, I know not what &s;hould have induced me to have written my hi&s;tory; or rather the hi&s;tory of my youth; for of what is yet re&s;erved for me I am &s;till ignorant.</P>
<P>Not that I pretend to con&s;ider the hypocri&s;y, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and profligacy of titled folly, and church pride, as things in them&s;elves extraordinary. It was the coincidence and the number and man|ner of them, by which in the cri&s;is of my fate I &s;eemed to be &s;o repeatedly and &s;o peculiarly affected, that occa&s;ioned &s;urpri&s;e and pain.</P>
<P>Yet what was all that I had hitherto felt from per&s;ons like the&s;e, when I re|member that which I was now immedi|ately doomed to feel? The perverted and the vicious it is true can excite emo|tion, and excite it &s;trongly. But how comparatively feeble does their utmo&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="125">
malice &s;eem, as far as it affects only our|&s;elves, when brought in competition with the thunder-bolt that &s;trikes the virtuous; that &s;huts the gate of hope; and that robs us of tho&s;e un&s;peakable plea&s;ures which imagination has fondly &s;tored, as a grand re&s;ource again&s;t evil, fall when and how it may?</P>
<P>Parting from the Baronet, expecting what was almo&s;t certain &s;ome change of political &s;entiment, no matter how brought about, by which my flattering expectations were at once to be rooted up, my thoughts inevitably flowed into that train which was bitterne&s;s little &s;hort of angui&s;h. Mr. Evelyn was a man of &s;uch peculiar virtue and di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence, of a heart &s;o generous and &s;o little capable of accu&s;ing me in con&s;e|quence of the ba&s;ene&s;s of others, that to have &s;u&s;pected him of &s;uch a mi&s;take would have been the height of inju&s;tice. But I could not forget the &s;ums that he
<PB N="124" REF="126">
had advanced, in all four hundred pounds, the more than probable failure of all the plans for which they had been advanced, and the incapacity I had and &s;hould have to repay the&s;e &s;ums.</P>
<P>Neither could I forbear to take a re|&s;tro&s;pective view of the manner in which they had been expended. Could I ap|prove of that manner? Could I forget how &s;hort a time it was, though I had &s;quandered my own money, &s;ince I had forfeited no atom of my independence by accepting the earnings of others? Suppo&s;e this parliamentary plan to fail, and fail it mu&s;t, for there were no hopes that I could hone&s;tly retain my &s;eat, to what other means could I re&s;ort? While I continued to indulge in wild and extra|vagant &s;chemes of enriching my&s;elf, by which I did but impoveri&s;h others, ought I to require of Olivia to partake of my folly, and its con&s;equences? Had I no|thing but the cup of wretchedne&s;s to
<PB N="125" REF="127">
offer, and mu&s;t I &s;till urge her to drink? Was it not my duty rather to tear my|&s;elf at once away from her; and place &s;ome in&s;urmountable barrier between us, that &s;hould relieve her from &s;uch an ill-fated predilection?</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e thoughts, I proceeded toward the re&s;idence of Mr. Evelyn. It was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;ee him im|mediately: for &s;ilence would have been the meane&s;t deceit. I went with an af|flicted heart. But how did I return? Why do I &s;ay afflicted? No! Angui&s;h, real angui&s;h, &s;ince I had known him, had not yet reached me. But it was coming. It was ru&s;hing forward, like a torrent; to bear away inferior cares and &s;orrows, and engulph them wholly.</P>
<P>Unexpected events are &s;ometimes pe|culiarly marked, by certain uncommon incidental circum&s;tances. As I was walk|ing ha&s;tily forward, anxious to meet Mr. Evelyn at home, I &s;aw a coffin borne
<PB N="126" REF="128">
before me by four men at &s;ome di&s;tance. Their pace was bri&s;k. I had &s;everal &s;treets to pa&s;s, before I arrived at the hou&s;e where Mr. Evelyn had apartments; and &s;till the coffin turned the way that I was to go.</P>
<P>I overtook and went before it: but the gloomy object had excited my atten|tion, and I pre&s;ently looked behind me. Still it took the &s;ame route. I looked again, and again; and it was continually at my heels.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange how imagination will work, and how ideas will &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves. I wi&s;hed is any where el&s;e; but it &s;eemed to pur&s;ue me.</P>
<P>At length I came to my journey's end; and, having knocked at the door, looked round with a kind of infatuated fear. The coffin was following, and I &s;tood with an ab&s;urd and fanciful trepidation, waiting that I might once &s;ee it fairly pa&s;t the door. Yet I was no bigot, no believer
<PB N="127" REF="129">
in omens, and was almo&s;t a&s;hamed of an idea which the coffin it&s;elf and the gloomy &s;tate of my mind had &s;ugge&s;ted: but which was in reality &s;uper&s;titious. The &s;ervant came, and the door was opened: but the coffin approached, and I would not &s;tir till it &s;hould pa&s;s me.</P>
<P>Pa&s;s it did. But where? Into the pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s. The men a&s;ked where it was to go? "Into the fir&s;t floor," was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>It was the apartment of Mr. Evelyn.</P>
<P>Heavens! What was the pang that &s;hot acro&s;s my brain? I ga&s;ped for utter|ance: but &s;till was dumb. A dread &s;o terrible had &s;eized me that there I &s;tood; motionle&s;s and &s;tupefied.</P>
<P>The woman who opened the door and directed the men belonged to the hou&s;e; and, ju&s;t as the bearers were proceeding with the coffin up &s;tairs, Matthew, the country &s;ervant, who had attended Mr.
<PB N="128" REF="130">
Evelyn in the di&s;&s;ecting room the fir&s;t night of our meeting, came in.</P>
<P>The moment he &s;aw me, the poor fel|low bur&s;t into tears; and exclaimed&mdash; "Oh &s;ir!"</P>
<P>His look and the tone of his voice were &s;ufficient. There was but one event that could have produced them, in &s;uch an extraordinary and unfeigned degree of grief. My horrible fears were ful|filled.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a moment, &s;obbed, and again cried in a mo&s;t piercing and la|mentable tone, "My poor ma&s;ter!"</P>
<P>I mu&s;t draw the curtain over feelings that I cannot pretend to paint. How long I &s;tood, what I fir&s;t &s;aid, or what my looks were, are things of which I know nothing. I only recollect that my eyes were &s;tone, and had not a tear to &s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A PROOF OF THE DANGER OF NOT ATTENDING TO TRIFLES. A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO CHARACTER|ISE A MAN OF UNCOMMON VIRTUE. THE DYING ANXIETIES OF MR. EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>THE melancholy particulars of this &s;trange tragedy were that, three days be|fore, Mr. Evelyn, being then in perfect health, had been di&s;&s;ecting a limb in a high &s;tate of putre&s;cene. During the operation, the in&s;trument had &s;lipped, and made what he con&s;idered only as a &s;cratch of the &s;kin; and &s;o &s;light that he did not immediately deem it worthy of notice: though, when he had ended, he felt a tingling; and then thought it pru|dent to wa&s;h with vinegar, and bind it up to keep out the air.</P>
<P>He was &s;o bu&s;ily engaged, during the day, that he paid no more attention to it; though he once or twice felt a throbbing
<PB N="130" REF="132">
that was unu&s;ual. Being fatigued, and finding his &s;pirits rather agitated, he took a gentle opiate at going to re&s;t: but was waked in the middle of the night, by &s;ymptoms of a very alarming kind. The morbid humour that was introduced in|to the &s;y&s;tem, &s;mall as it probably was in quantity, was &s;o active that Mr. Evelyn was &s;eized with a violent inflammatory fever: &s;o that he was delirious when he woke, and died in le&s;s than eight and forty hours after he received this &s;light wound.</P>
<P>Such is the uncertain fate of man, in this &s;tate of ignorance. To &s;uch &s;udden accidents of &s;ickne&s;s and death are the good and the bad, the fooli&s;h and the wi&s;e, continually &s;ubject; and &s;uch at pre&s;ent is the frail tenure of life that the man in who&s;e hall we fea&s;ted on Mon|day, or the blooming beauty with whom we &s;ung and danced, ere the week pa&s;&s;es away, are de&s;cended to the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133">What tribute can friend&s;hip or affec|tion pay, to the memory of a man like this? There is only one that is worthy of his virtues; and that is to record them: that, he being gone, his exam|ple may in&s;pire the benevolence he prac|ti&s;ed; and teach others to communicate the ble&s;&s;ings he conferred.</P>
<P>Oh that I had the power to pourtray tho&s;e virtues in all their lu&s;tre! Ages unborn would then rejoice, that &s;uch a man had lived; and feel the benefits he would have be&s;towed. But it is a ta&s;k that cannot be accompli&s;hed in a few pages. His life was a va&s;t volume of the be&s;t of actions, which originated in the be&s;t of principles. Peace, love, and reve|rence, be with his memory.</P>
<P>For my own part, if, in addition to that uncommon public worth which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and that noble &s;cale of morality by which he regulated his life, the per&s;onal kindne&s;s which he heaped on me be re|membered,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
I mu&s;t have le&s;s of affection than &s;avage brutality, did no portion of his &s;pirit in&s;pire me while I &s;peak of the&s;e events.</P>
<P>Nor did his friend&s;hip end while un|der&s;tanding had the lea&s;t remaining power. His la&s;t act of benevolence was a &s;trenuous but incoherent effort to pre|vent the mi&s;chief which, di&s;turbed as his functions were, he &s;till had recollection enough to apprehend would fall on me.</P>
<P>The reader is informed of the mort|gage I gave Mr. Evelyn, when I received not merely a qualification but the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate; and I imagine he will not think I was too &s;crupulou&s;ly care|ful, to guard and prove the hone&s;ty of my intentions, when I further tell him that, for the &s;ums of money which Mr. Evelyn advanced, I in&s;i&s;ted on giving my promi&s;&s;ory notes for repayment. I was pertinacious, and would accept &s;uch favours on no other terms.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135">This mortgage and the&s;e notes were lying in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Evelyn, at the time of his death. He had appre|hended no danger, till the fever and the delirium &s;eized him: at the beginning of which he called his &s;ervant, Matthew (I tell the &s;tory as the poor fellow told it to me), and, giving him a key, bade him go down to his bureau, and &s;earch among his papers for a parchment and &s;ome notes, that were tied together with red tape.</P>
<P>Having uttered this, he began to talk in a wild and wandering manner; of fet|ters, and pri&s;ons; and a&s;ked Matthew if he knew why &s;uch places were built? "So make ha&s;te, Matthew," &s;aid he, "and burn the parchment, and burn the notes, and burn the bureau. After which, you know, all will be &s;afe, Matthew; and they can never harm Mr. Trevor. You love Mr. Trevor, Matthew: do not you?"</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">His recollection then &s;eemed to re|turn; and he a&s;ked, "Of what have I been talking? Go, Matthew; &s;eek the parchment and the notes: tied with red tape. Ob&s;erve: there is no other parch|ment tied with red tape. Bring them to me directly."</P>
<P>Matthew had taken the key; but ju&s;t as he was going the Doctor, who had been &s;ent for, arrived.</P>
<P>Matthew went, however, as he was di|rected; and, applying the key to the lock, found it was a wrong one.</P>
<P>The Doctor, alarmed for the &s;tate in which he &s;aw Mr. Evelyn, immediately wrote a pre&s;cription, and rang for the &s;ervant to run and have it prepared at the &s;hop of the next apothecary. Mat|thew an&s;wered the bell; and Mr. Eve|lyn &s;eeing him eagerly demanded&mdash; "Where is the parchment? Have you brought me the parchment? Why do not you bring me the parchment?"
<PB N="135" REF="137">
"For," &s;aid Matthew, "I held out the key; and he &s;aw I had nothing el&s;e in my hands."</P>
<P>The Doctor a&s;ked Matthew what parch|ment his ma&s;ter wanted? And Matthew replied, he could not tell: except that his ma&s;ter &s;aid it was in the bureau, and tied with red tape. "Why do not you bring it?" &s;aid Mr. Evelyn. Then turn|ing to the Doctor, added&mdash;"It is a bun|dle of mi&s;ery; and you know, &s;ir, we ought to drive all mi&s;ery from the face of the earth. I cannot tell how it came in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Why do you not go and bring it me, Matthew? And pray, &s;ir, do you &s;ee it de&s;troyed. Promi&s;e me that; I beg you will!, Becau&s;e Mr. Trevor is in the country. I am afraid elections are but bad things. What, &s;ir, is your opinion? For I think I &s;hall die; and he will then have no friend on earth to &s;ecure him the poll."</P>
<P>"Seeing my poor ma&s;ter was &s;o dis|turbed
<PB N="136" REF="138">
in his mind," &s;aid Matthew, "the doctor <HI>bid</HI> me run as fa&s;t as I could for the &s;tuff he had ordered: which I did. But I was obliged to wait till it was made up; and when I <HI>come</HI> back my poor dear ma&s;ter was more di&s;tracting light-headed than ever. But &s;till he kept raving about the parchment; and his cou&s;in, Sir Bar|nard; and you, Mr. Trevor: all which the Doctor &s;aid we mu&s;t not heed, be|cau&s;e he did not know what he &s;aid. Though, for all that, I could not but mightily fear there was &s;omething hung heavy on his mind: for, as long as ever he could be heard to &s;peak, he kept call|ing every now and then for the parch|ment. And after that, when he lay heav|ing for breath and rattling in the throat and nobody could tell a word that he &s;aid, he kept moving his lips ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as when he could make him&s;elf heard.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. DOUBTS CONCERNING THE JUSTICE OF WILLS AND TESTAMENTS. THE PROVIDENT CARE OF THE BARONET. A DEMONSTRATION OF HIS ARDENT LOVE FOR HIS COUNTRY. HECTOR LOSES HIS ELECTION. MY DETERMINATION TO ACCEPT THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man di&s;covers that the pa|thos of his &s;tory, and the virtues which he has in contemplation, are entirely be|yond the power of language, what me|thod can he take but that of leaving off abruptly: that he may &s;uffer the imagi|nation to perform an office to which any other effort is inadequate? As Mr. Evelyn lived &s;o he died. To prevent evil and to do unbounded good was his
<PB N="138" REF="140">
ruling pa&s;&s;ion. It never left him, till life departed.</P>
<P>It is a phenomenon which has fre|quently been remarked that, in a &s;tate of delirium, the mind has its luminous moments: during which it &s;eems to have a more clear and comprehen&s;ive view of con&s;equences than in its more &s;ober pe|riods of health. The evil that excited &s;o &s;trong and painful an alarm in the mind of my dying friend was no idle dream. The Baronet was his heir at law. Mr. Evelyn had made no will: for not only was his death premature but, knowing the mi&s;chiefs that have ari&s;en from di&s;|putes concerning te&s;tamentary beque&s;ts, he &s;trongly doubted of the morality of making any. It was never his intention to hoard; and, hoping or I might rather &s;ay expecting to have a clear pro&s;pect of the approach of death, his plan was to di&s;tribute all the per&s;onal property in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before he died, in the manner
<PB N="139" REF="141">
that he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e would be mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>However, whether it were a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of rectitude or an improper pride of heart, I own that I felt plea&s;ed, as far as my&s;elf was concerned, that the intentions of Mr. Evelyn, when he called for the parchment, were not executed. I did not indeed fore&s;ee all that was to hap|pen: but I felt an abhorrence of being liable to be &s;u&s;pected of I know not what imputed arts, or crimes; by the aid of which malice or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s might a&s;|&s;ert I had come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a part of Mr. Evelyn's property.</P>
<P>Not that, if the deeds and notes had been de&s;troyed, I &s;hould have thought it ju&s;t to have retained the e&s;tate that I held. But my virtue was not fated to be put to this trial. When I met Sir Barnard at the Cocoa tree, he not only knew of the decea&s;e of Mr. Evelyn but had ordered &s;eals to be placed on all the locks; under
<PB N="140" REF="142">
which it was imagined that papers or effects might be &s;ecured. Having heard the &s;tory of Matthew, I could have no doubt but that the mortgage deeds, and the notes for &s;ums received, would now fall into the Baronet's power.</P>
<P>It is true I might, if I plea&s;ed, bid him defiance. No: I ought not to have &s;aid, if I plea&s;ed; but, if I could conde&s;cend to acknowledge my&s;elf a &s;coundrel. He had made me his own member, and had him&s;elf impowered me to avoid the pu|ni&s;hment which is a&s;&s;igned by law to unfortunate debtors: for, under this be&s;t of governments, &s;uch as a repre&s;entative of the people was now my privilege. This immaculate con&s;titution, to which all the homage that man can pay is in|&s;ufficient wor&s;hip, vaunted as it is and revered by all parties, or all parties are broad day liars, for all and each &s;trive to be mo&s;t loud and extravagant in prai&s;e of it, this con&s;titution in its very e&s;&s;ence
<PB N="141" REF="143">
decrees that things which are vile and unju&s;t, in one man, are right and lawful, in another.</P>
<P>Well then: by the aid of this con&s;ti|tution, which I too mu&s;t prai&s;e if I would e&s;cape whipping, I might &s;eat my&s;elf as Sir Barnard's member, and aid to coun|tenance and make laws, to which I and the other wi&s;e law-makers my coadjutors &s;hould not be &s;ubject. I might, how|ever offen&s;ive the term may be to certain delicate ears, I might become a privi|leged &s;windler; and rob every man who &s;hould do me the inju&s;tice to think me hone&s;t.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o dear a lover and &s;o ardent an admirer of the con&s;titution, as Sir Barnard was, &s;hould once &s;u&s;pect that I would not benefit my&s;elf by all its ble&s;&s;ings: that is, that I would not cheat him to the very be&s;t of my ability. This &s;uppo&s;ition had in|duced him, during our conver&s;ation at
<PB N="142" REF="144">
the Cocoa tree, to &s;truggle with and keep down tho&s;e indignant ri&s;ings with which, notwith&s;tanding the modulated tone of his voice, I could &s;ee he was more than half choaked.</P>
<P>After what I had heard and &s;ituated as I was at pre&s;ent, I had very little doubt either of the purity of his patrioti&s;m or the manner in which it would affect me. Still however I had &s;ome. There might be a change in his politics; but it might neither be of the nature nor of the ex|tent that I feared.</P>
<P>But the&s;e doubts did not di&s;tre&s;s me long. They were entirely removed, by that mo&s;t authentic &s;ource of intelli|gence the Gazette; in which, about a fortnight after the death of Mr. Evelyn, I read the following unequivocal proof of the Baronet's inordinate love of his country.</P>
<P>"The King has been plea&s;ed to grant the dignity of a Baron of the kingdom of
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Great Britain to Sir Barnard Bray, Ba|ronet; by the name &s;tile and title of Baron Bray, of Bray hall in the county of Somer&s;et; and to the heirs male of his body, lawfully begotten."</P>
<P>I was now no longer at a lo&s;s for the rea&s;on of the Baronet's late &s;udden de|parture, and the de&s;ertion of his politi|cal friends at the election. What are friends? What are elections? What is our country, compared to the &s;miles of a prime mini&s;ter; and the titles he can be&s;tow? Nothing now was want|ing to the honor of the hou&s;e of Bray! It might in time I own pant after a Dukedom; and a Duke of Bray might as ju&s;tly be &s;tiled princely and mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant as many another Duke. But at pre&s;ent it was full with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>This court document, brief though it was, &s;poke volumes. It was a fla&s;h of lightning, that gave me a di&s;tinct view of the black and dreadful aby&s;s that was
<PB N="144" REF="146">
immediately before me; and into which I fore&s;aw I mu&s;t be plunged.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, I read that the Idford candidate had been returned for the county of * * * *; and that con&s;e|quently Hector had lo&s;t his election.</P>
<P>This was not all. Heated by the illi|beral practices which always attend &s;uch contentions, knowing the bribery that he had u&s;ed him&s;elf, and convinced that he could prove the &s;ame corrupt means to have been re&s;orted to by his oppo|nent, he was not &s;atisfied with the deva&s;|tation he had already committed upon his fortune; but was determined to de|mand a <HI>&s;crutiny:</HI> and if he &s;hould be foiled in that effort, he was re&s;olved to try the merits of the election before a committee of the hou&s;e of commons. Such was the report that was immedi|ately propagated; and which was after|ward verified by facts.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;elf convinced as
<PB N="145" REF="147">
I was of its danger, I had made my choice. My fixed purpo&s;e was to vacate my &s;eat in parliament. It might per|haps be que&s;tioned, &s;ince the pretended voters had in reality no voice, and their imaginary repre&s;entative was no more than a per&s;on nominated by the new Lord Bray, whether I ought to re&s;ign an office which, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;hould fill for the good of mankind; and give place to &s;ome per&s;on who, obedient to his leader, would do the rever&s;e?</P>
<P>But one act of ba&s;ene&s;s cannot autho|rize another. To bear about me a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-degradation, a certainty that I was &s;heltering my&s;elf from the power of my late patron by a privilege which I con&s;i|dered as highly vicious, a &s;ubterfuge &s;uch as every man who de&s;erves the name ought to de&s;pi&s;e and &s;purn at, this was in&s;ufferable. I had lo&s;t much: for I had lo&s;t hopes that had been extrava|gant and unbounded in promi&s;e: but
<PB N="146" REF="148">
I had not lo&s;t a con&s;cious rectitude of heart, without which exi&s;tence was not to be endured.</P>

<P>IT is happy for man that there is &s;carce|ly any &s;tate of &s;uffering, whether of mind or body, in which pain is unremitting; and wholly unmixed with plea&s;ure. If he be unhappy him&s;elf, it will be &s;trange &s;hould there be no one more fortunate for whom he has an affection: no friend that is more pro&s;perous, and in who&s;e pro&s;perity he takes delight.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">The &s;ea&s;on of the year had arrived when the comedy of Wilmot had been put into rehear&s;al, and was to be per|formed. It was a trying occa&s;ion; and tho&s;e who knew him loved him too well to be ab&s;ent: though the few intimate friends who had read the piece had no doubt of its &s;ucce&s;s. The partial failure of his tragedy had produced no jealou&s;y of rival&s;hip: though, as its merits had been publicly acknowledged, it had in|curred no di&s;grace. In private life, he was beloved; and, as a public man, his merits had not yet created him enemies. He has &s;ince, indeed, in that re&s;pect, not been &s;o fortunate. But he has never thought it ju&s;t to complain: being con|vinced that mi&s;take, though it &s;hould be rectified, &s;hould not be re&s;ented.</P>
<P>The evening of repre&s;entation arrived, the hou&s;e was crowded, the company brilliant, and the plaudits with which the author was honoured e&s;labli&s;hed his re|putation,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
and confirmed the judgment of his friends.</P>
<P>During the performance, I &s;at in the boxes; and, among the &s;pectors in the pit, I di&s;covered a man who&s;e hair was white, who&s;e locks were venerable, and who I was well convinced was the &s;tranger whom I had found wounded at the entrance of Barnes common. I was in a &s;ide-box, and he was near the op|po&s;ite pit door; &s;o that the di&s;tance made it rather doubtful: yet the more I looked the more I was convinced it was the &s;ame per&s;on. The comedy was nearly ended when I fir&s;t &s;aw him; and I de|termined, as &s;oon as I had heard the epilogue, to go and &s;atisfy my&s;elf how far my per&s;ua&s;ion was true.</P>
<P>I went round to the door; but the pit was &s;o crowded that it was with difficulty I could make my way to the &s;eat. When I was there my labour was lo&s;t: I could not find him; and, enquiring for him
<PB N="149" REF="151">
by de&s;cription of the per&s;ons near where he &s;at, they told me that &s;uch a gentle|man had been there; but that he com|plained of the heat, and had left the hou&s;e immediately after the curtain dropped.</P>
<P>This incident gave me con&s;iderable chagrin. However, as his per&s;on was very remarkable, and being per&s;uaded he was actually the wounded &s;tranger, I conceived hopes that I &s;hould again meet him; in &s;ome place where the danger of lo&s;ing &s;ight of him would not be &s;o great.</P>
<P>There being no expectation of his return, I went in &s;earch of my friends: in company with whom, rejoicing in the &s;ucce&s;s of Wilmot and glorying in the ac|qui&s;ition of poetry and the &s;tage, I whol|ly forgot my&s;elf and my own affairs, and &s;pent one more very delightful evening.</P>
<P>The&s;e affairs however were not long to be forgotten. The returns of the elec|tions throughout Great Britain had all
<PB N="150" REF="152">
been made, and the new parliament &s;um|moned to a&s;&s;emble. It was with infinite and deep regret that I found my&s;elf excluded by my own &s;en&s;e of rectitude. I would willingly have taken my &s;eat, had it been only for one night: for I was ea|gerly de&s;irous of an opportunity to deli|ver my thoughts, and urge &s;ome of tho&s;e u&s;eful truths which may be uttered with more &s;afety there than in le&s;s privileged places.</P>
<P>But I was too well acquainted with the cu&s;toms and forms of the hou&s;e to hope that this opportunity could now be found. I had no parliamentary friends; no &s;upporters; and there was not the lea&s;t probability that a youth &s;o wholly unknown &s;hould <HI>catch the &s;peaker's eye,</HI> who&s;e notice &s;o many were ready to &s;o|licit.</P>
<P>The&s;e things having been duly weighed, I had already applied for the chiltern hun|dreds and my &s;eat was declared vacated:
<PB N="151" REF="153">
to the great joy of Lord Bray; and his now bo&s;om friend, the Earl of Idford. This joy was the greater becau&s;e it was an event of which they had not the lea&s;t expectation. The due forms of law had been ob&s;erved, the &s;eals had been removed from the locks of my late ine&s;timable friend, his cou&s;in the new peer was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mortgage and the notes for money received, and he had no con|ception of any motives that could induce me to an act which mu&s;t leave me en|tirely at his mercy.</P>
<P>It cannot however be &s;uppo&s;ed, as I have already &s;aid, that I had any inten|tion to retain the e&s;tate; which I had re|ceived from Mr. Evelyn as a qualifica|tion, and a &s;upport. It was now the pro|perty of Lord Bray; and obligation to him was a thing that would not admit of a que&s;tion. I did not therefore wait for any notice from his lord&s;hip, or his at|torney,
<PB N="152" REF="154">
but de&s;ired Mr. Hilary to inform him that I was ready at any time to give up the deeds, and receive back the mort|gage.</P>
<P>This would have been a trifle. It was not a &s;acrifice; but a riddance: by which, could it have ended here, I &s;hould have regained &s;omething of that ela&s;ticity of heart which independence only can feel. Here, however, it could not end. I was obliged to in&s;truct Mr. Hilary to add that I was willing to give my own per|&s;onal &s;ecuriry, by bond or in any man|ner my creditor &s;hould plea&s;e, for money received and intere&s;t due: but to ac|knowledge that I had no immediate means of payment. In other words, that my per&s;on was entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of him&s;elf and the law. I might have re|minded him that more than half of my debt was incurred by <HI>genteel pre&s;ents</HI> to his craving electors; and that he had in|formed
<PB N="153" REF="155">
me that it was a nece&s;&s;ary ex|pence: but to this I could not conde|&s;cend.</P>
<P>The little bu&s;ine&s;s which, during his life, Mr. Evelyn had in law Mr. Hilary had always tran&s;acted. He had a &s;incere regard for me, and a reverence for the memory of his late kin&s;man; who&s;e ear|ne&s;t recommendation of me he did not forget. Being well acquainted with the character of Lord Bray, he fore&s;aw and warned me of my danger. While a ba|ronet, to behold him&s;elf a peer had been his lord&s;hip's darling pa&s;&s;ion: but that was now gratified; and, as he was proud, he was likewi&s;e revengeful. In this ca&s;e, however, to warn was u&s;ele&s;s. I had no alternative, except by means that were di&s;honorable.</P>
<P>Nor was the re&s;entment of Lord Bray &s;ingle, or &s;o much to be apprehended as that of the Earl, with whom he had en|tered into &s;trict alliance. My behaviour
<PB N="154" REF="156">
to Lord Idford had uniformly been what he deemed &s;o very in&s;olent that his an|tipathy may be &s;aid to have taken birth at my fir&s;t act of di&s;obedience: my refu|&s;al to dine at the &s;econd table. Since then, as he conceived, it had been pro|gre&s;&s;ive in aggravation. My &s;corn of his &s;elfi&s;h politics, my attempt to conti|nue the Letters of Themi&s;tocles, and write him who was the &s;uppo&s;ed author of them into di&s;grace, the pamphlet of which I was the author, the activity with which I had canva&s;&s;ed in favour of Mow|bray, and to &s;um up all my daring to ri|val him with the woman on whom he would have conferred his per&s;on, his dig|nity, and his other great qualities, were all of them injuries that rankled at his heart. When the&s;e things are remem|bered, few will feel &s;urpri&s;ed that the Earl &s;hould indulge a pa&s;&s;ion which is in it&s;elf &s;o active: or that he &s;hould induce Lord Bray to pur&s;ue that kind of conduct
<PB N="155" REF="157">
to which he was already &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The danger however mu&s;t be faced; and Mr. Hilary wrote, as my attorney, to &s;tate the circum&s;tances above recited. A week elap&s;ed before he received an an&s;wer: but at the end of that time his lord&s;hip's attorney replied, that per&s;onal &s;ecurity for &s;o large a &s;um could not be accepted: my bond would be no better than the notes I had given: and that I was required immediately to pay what was due, to the e&s;tate and heirs of the late Mr. Evelyn.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit in which this note was written proved the temper of my credi|tor; and an incident &s;oon occurred by which his propen&s;ity to per&s;ecute was called into action. The &s;crutiny which Hector had demanded was over, and de|cided again&s;t him: but; under&s;tanding that there was an ab&s;olute breach be|tween me and Lord Bray, Mowbray
<PB N="156" REF="158">
was convinced that he had accu&s;ed me fal&s;ely. As he was almo&s;t certain that he could prove bribery and corruption to have been practi&s;ed by his opponent, he per&s;i&s;ted in determining to bring it be|fore the hou&s;e of commons. This bu&s;i|ne&s;s kept him &s;till in the country, where he and his parti&s;ans were bu&s;ily collect|ing information.</P>
<P>He had experienced my utility in the cour&s;e of the election, he wi&s;hed to enjoy the &s;ame advantage at pre&s;ent, and he and his committee likewi&s;e di&s;covered that my evidence was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;a|ry. He therefore wrote me an apology, &s;poke in the hand&s;ome&s;t terms he could recollect of the &s;ervices I had done him, reque&s;ted me to come down once more to aid him in his pre&s;ent attempt, and &s;tated the points on which my future te&s;|timony would be u&s;eful. He further in|formed me that a gentleman of the law, whom he named, was to &s;et off the morn|ing
<PB N="157" REF="159">
after I &s;hould receive the letter, at ten o'clock, and come po&s;t; and that he &s;hould be much obliged to me if I would take a &s;eat in the &s;ame chai&s;e.</P>
<P>The letter was read in the committee room, as a matter of bu&s;ine&s;s; and in this committee room Lord Idford had a &s;ecret agent, from whom he gained in|telligence of all their proceedings that de&s;erved notice.</P>
<P>De&s;irous as I was of obliging the bro|ther of Olivia, I made no he&s;itation to comply. The evening before I was to go down into * * * * *, I went to Mr. Hilary; to acquaint him with the place of my de&s;tination, and the manner in which he might direct to me, if any thing new &s;hould occur. The agents of Lord Bray, or to &s;peak more truly of the Earl, had been exceedingly indu&s;trious; and a writ was already procured. It was intended to take me as I &s;tepped into the chai&s;e, or that evening if po&s;&s;ible, and

accordingly the door where I lived was watched, and I was &s;een to come out. My u&s;ual pace was bri&s;k, but I happened now to be in ha&s;te; and, as they told me them&s;elves, the &s;etters lo&s;t &s;ight of me for &s;ome time, were afterward cautious of coming up to me in any public &s;treet where a re&s;cue was probable, and fol|lowed me till I came almo&s;t to the door of Mr. Hilary.</P>
<P>Here there was a carriage &s;tanding; and, to my great &s;urprisfe and joy, I &s;aw Mr. Hilary with a light, conducting out the very per&s;on whom I had &s;ome time before di&s;covered in the pit, and whom I now knew to be the wounded &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I he&s;itated whether I ought to &s;pring forward, and intrude my enquiries im|mediately upon him, or make them of Mr. Hilary, with whom it appeared he was acquainted; and, at this in&s;tant, the bailiff and his two men came up with me, and told me I was their pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="163">While I &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at this &s;ud|den and at that preci&s;e time unexpected event, the carriage with the &s;tranger in it drove away; and Mr. Hilary &s;hut the door without &s;eeing me.</P>
<P>There is a &s;en&s;e of indignity, and di&s;|grace in being arre&s;ted, at which all tho&s;e who have not been frequently &s;ub|jected to it revolt. I was wholly igno|rant of the manners of the people who had laid their hands upon me. I had heard of giving bail: but I had like|wi&s;e heard that it was a thing of danger, to which men were generally aver&s;e; and I had a bitter repugnance to a&s;k any thing which I thought it was likely &s;hould be refu&s;ed. Neither had I any probable per&s;on to a&s;k: for my little law reading had taught me that the &s;ureties of a debtor mu&s;t be hou&s;e-keepers.</P>
<P>Unwilling therefore to trouble Mr. Hilary, and finding my&s;elf without re|&s;ource,
<PB N="160" REF="164">
I de&s;ired the bailiff to take me wherever he plea&s;ed, or wherever the law directed. "I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you do not mean we &s;hould take you to jail?" &s;aid the bailiff.</P>
<P>Ignorant as I was and &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, I a&s;ked where el&s;e they meant to take me? He replied "To my hou&s;e, Sir: or to any other lock up hou&s;e that you choo&s;e."</P>
<P>"A lock up hou&s;e, Sir!" &s;aid I. "Pray what is that ?"</P>
<P>The bailiff knew not how to give a di|rect an&s;wer; but replied "There <HI>is</HI> &s;ome lock up hou&s;es at which a gentle|man may be treated like a gentleman: though I cannot &s;ay but there <HI>is</HI> others that <HI>is</HI> &s;habby enough. I &s;ee very well, Sir, you are a young gentleman, and do not know the trim of &s;uch things: &s;o, if you plea&s;e to go to my hou&s;e, you will find very civil u&s;age. I can tell by your
<PB N="161" REF="165">
cut, Sir, that you are no &s;crub; &s;o my wife will take care to furni&s;h you with every thing that is genteel and polite."</P>
<P>The man &s;melled exce&s;&s;ively of bran|dy and tobacco; which, corre&s;ponding with his gait, looks, and language, &s;eem|ed an introduction to the purgatory to which I was doomed. I thought proper however to accept his offer, and go to the hou&s;e where I was to be treated with &s;o much politene&s;s and gentility.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. THE GOOD BREEDING OF A BAILIFF. A PERIOD OF DEJECTION. A VISIT FROM MR. HILARY. THE HOPES HE CONCEIVES.</HEAD>
<P>THE bailiff and one of his followers walked be&s;ide me, cautioul&s;y keeping in advance; and the other marched behind till we came to a &s;tand of coaches, and I
<PB N="162" REF="166">
was a&s;ked whether one of them &s;hould be called? I was thoroughly a&s;hamed of my company: but a deep &s;en&s;e of indig|nity confu&s;es thought; and, till it was propo&s;ed by the bailiff, I had forgotten that there was &s;uch a thing as a coach. His propo&s;al was immediately accepted; and we were driven through Lincoln's-inn-fields into Carey-&s;treet, where we were obliged to alight and pa&s;s through &s;everal narrow allies.</P>
<P>I had no great expectations of the gen|tility of the bailiff's abode: but, &s;lender as they were, the few I had were di&s;ap|pointed. I was wholly unu&s;ed to &s;uch places: this I &s;u&s;pect was one of the meane&s;t of them; and the approach to the hou&s;e, as well as all that was in it, be|&s;poke wretchedne&s;s, and in&s;pired di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we entered the doors, the bailiff called aloud for Charlotte (the name of his wife) and de&s;ired her, to bring light into the drawing room.
<PB N="163" REF="167">
"Why what do you talk of, George?" replied Charlotte. "Are you drunk? Don't you know the gentleman is there that you brought in this morning?"</P>
<P>"Do you think I don't know what I am about?" an&s;wered George. "I have brought another gentleman: &s;o that there gentleman mu&s;t come down, and <HI>hoik</HI> into the be&s;t parlour."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," retorted Charlotte with great vivacity and &s;ignificance, "he has behaved va&s;tly proper, &s;ince he came in|to my hou&s;e. He has had friends with him all afternoon; and dined, and call|ed for wine, and done every thing that was genteel."</P>
<P>Though half in a trance, I was &s;uf|ficiently awake to under&s;tand her mean|ing. I therefore interrupted the bailiff, who had begun to reply with pa&s;&s;ion. "You are very right, Madam;" &s;aid I, "The gentleman mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed.
<PB N="164" REF="168">
I have no friends that drink wine; and I drink none my&s;elf."</P>
<P>This hint was quite &s;ufficient. Nei|ther the drawing room nor the be&s;t par|lour were now to be had; and I was &s;hewn into a dirty back place, which was little more than a clo&s;et, decorated with a wooden cut of Lord Lovat over the mantle piece, and corre&s;ponding pic|tures of the king and queen on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>Before &s;he &s;hut the door, Charlotte de|manded "if I cho&s;e to have &s;ome more coals on the fire? And whether I would have two candles or one? "Whatever you plea&s;e madam," I replied. "Nay, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he pertly, "that is ju&s;t as you plea&s;e." I made no an&s;wer, and &s;he &s;hut the door with a di&s;&s;atisfied air; which &s;he locked on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>At any other time, this George and Charlotte, with their drawing-room, would
<PB N="165" REF="169">
have pre&s;ented many whim&s;ical a&s;&s;ocia|tions to my mind: but at pre&s;ent my at|tention was called to the iron bars of the one window of my pri&s;on hole; and to the recolleclion that, in all probability, I was now &s;hut up for life. The weight of evil was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive that I &s;at mo|tionle&s;s, in &s;ullen &s;tupefaction, for a con|&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Hearing no &s;ound whatever, the bailiff I &s;uppo&s;e was alarmed: for he unlocked the door, and coming in abruptly ex|claimed "Oh! I thought it could not be!" Meaning probably that I could not po&s;&s;ibly have e&s;caped through the win|dow. Recollecting him&s;elf, he a&s;ked "if I did not think proper to &s;end to &s;ome friends?" To which I laconically an&s;wered, "No."</P>
<P>"But I &s;uppo&s;e you mean to give bail, &s;ir?"</P>
<P>"I have none to give."</P>
<P>"I perceive how it is, &s;ir. You are
<PB N="166" REF="170">
not u&s;ed to the bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;o you are ca&s;t down. You mu&s;t bethink your|&s;elf: for I dare &s;ay a young gentleman like you will find bail fa&s;t enough; <HI>beca&s;e</HI> why, the &s;um is not quite four hundred and forty pounds. We have people enough <HI>which</HI> will go of any me&s;&s;age for you; &s;o I would advi&s;e you to &s;end, though it is late; <HI>beca&s;e,</HI> as you <HI>&s;ays</HI> you don't drink, there will be no good much in your &s;taying here. Not but what we have as good beds, and as good wines and all &s;orts of liquors, and can get any thing el&s;e as good as a gentleman needs lick his lips to. There <HI>is</HI> never <HI>no</HI> com|plaints at our hou&s;e. So you had better take my advice, and cheer up your &s;pirits; and get a little &s;omething good in your belly, in the way of eating and drinking; and &s;end to let your friends know as how you are <HI>nabbed: beca&s;e</HI> nothing can come of it otherwi&s;e, neither to you <HI>no</HI> body el&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171">His di&s;cour&s;e awakened me enough to remind me of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending to the gentleman, with whom I had in|tended to travel the next day, and inform him of the impo&s;&s;ibility of my taking the journey. This led me to reflect further. The remark of the bailiff was ju&s;t: delay was prejudicial. What had happened could not be kept &s;ecret, &s;ecrecy was in it&s;elf vicious, and to increa&s;e evil by pro|cra&s;tination was cowardly. Thus far rou&s;ed, I pre&s;ently conceived and de|termined on my plan. I &s;aw no pro|bability of avoiding a pri&s;on: but, being in this hou&s;e, I was re&s;olved fir&s;t to &s;ee my friends. I had already &s;old my hor&s;es, and di&s;charged my &s;ervant. Clarke, I knew, would reproach me, if I did not accept his good offices in my di&s;tre&s;s; when &s;uch good offices as he could per|form would be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. I in|tended therefore to reque&s;t him the next morning to go round and inform &s;uch of
<PB N="168" REF="172">
my friends as I wi&s;hed to &s;ee: but, as the bailiff told me it would be proper to &s;end for my attorney immediately, I thought proper to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger; with one note to him, and another to the gentle|man with whom I was to have travelled.</P>
<P>Mr. Hilary was at home and came in|&s;tantly on the receipt of my billet. When he &s;aw me, he endeavoured to &s;mile; and not appear in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, or affected. But his feelings betrayed him; the tears &s;tarted into his eyes, and he was obliged to turn away his face. He made an effort, however, and recovered him&s;elf: after which, he rather endea|voured to enter into ea&s;y conver&s;ation than to talk of bu&s;ine&s;s. By this I &s;u&s;|pected that he neither dur&s;t tru&s;t him&s;elf nor me; till a little time &s;hould have re|conciled us to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This was a proper opportunity for en|quiries which my &s;udden misfortune had not made me forget. I que&s;tioned him
<PB N="169" REF="173">
concerning the &s;tranger, who&s;e per&s;on I de&s;cribed; and mentioned my having &s;een Mr. Hilary light him out of the hou&s;e, the moment before I was arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>"What do you know of him?" &s;aid Mr. Hilary, with an eager air. "Have you ever &s;een him before?"</P>
<P>"Yes; if I am not very much mi&s;|taken."</P>
<P>"Nay but tell me, what do you know?"</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t an&s;wer me concerning who and what he is?"</P>
<P>"A gentleman of large fortune, the la&s;t of his family, and a great traveller."</P>
<P>"Has he met with any accident late|ly?"</P>
<P>"Yes. But why do you a&s;k?"</P>
<P>"And why do you &s;eem &s;o much awakened by the que&s;tion?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e he is exce&s;&s;ively de&s;irous of di&s;covering &s;ome gentleman, who found him after he had been robbed, and left,
<PB N="170" REF="174">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be dead; that he may if po&s;&s;ible reward his pre&s;erver. Now there are &s;ome circum&s;tances, as related by the people of an inn to which he was taken, that have &s;ugge&s;ted a thought to me which, &s;hould it prove true, would give me inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"What are they?"</P>
<P>"That the good Samaritan, who per|formed this act of humanity, was a young gentleman with a &s;ervant out of livery; that he and his man rode two blood hor&s;es, both bright bays; that the &s;er|vant's name was Samuel; and that the ma&s;ter was in per&s;on very like you. All which corre&s;pond; and I really believe, by your &s;miling, that it actually was you."</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e it: what then?"</P>
<P>"Why then I am &s;ure you have gain|ed a friend, who will never &s;uffer you to go to pri&s;on."</P>
<P>The word friend conjured up a train of
<PB N="171" REF="175">
ideas, which almo&s;t overcame me. "I have lo&s;t a friend," &s;aid I, "who would not have &s;uffered me to go to pri&s;on. But he is gone. I accepted even <HI>his</HI> favours with an aching and unwilling heart; and pri&s;on it&s;elf will not, I &s;u&s;|pect, be &s;o painful to me as more obli|gations of the &s;ame kind, and conferred by a per&s;on who, though I am &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour, I &s;carcely can hope &s;hould equal Mr. Evelyn. And, if he even did, an extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;hould &s;till he&s;itate: I doubt if a pri&s;on it&s;elf be &s;o hateful as a knowledge that I am only out of one on &s;ufferance; and that, when any caprice &s;hall &s;eize my creditor, I may be hunted like a ferocious bea&s;t; and commanded to my den, like a crouching cur.</P>
<P>Mr. Hilary endeavoured to combat this train of thinking: but it was not to be conquered. The &s;hort period of trial &s;ince the death of Mr. Evelyn had af|forded
<PB N="172" REF="176">
me too many proofs of the pain|ful &s;en&s;ations which &s;uch a knowledge can excite; and of the propen&s;ity which I had to give them encouragement. To be as I have &s;aid the &s;lave of any man's temper, not as an effort of duty but from a &s;en&s;e of fear, was in&s;ufferable. A pri|&s;on, locks, bolts, and bread and water, were to be preferred.</P>
<P>Mr. Hilary &s;at with me till bed time; and, not only to put the bailiff in good humour, but to cheer my heart and his own, ordered &s;upper, and drank more plentifully of wine than was his cu&s;tom: urging me to follow his example. I did not refu&s;e: for I had a contempt for any thing that had the appearance of an inca|pacity to endure whatever the tyranny of rancorous men and unju&s;t laws could in|flict. The &s;tranger, he told me, was gone down into the country; from whence he would return within a week: but he forbore to mention his name, as he
<PB N="173" REF="177">
had been in&s;tructed; the &s;tranger having enquiries to make, which induced him to keep it &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Before he left me, Mr. Hilary receiv|ed in&s;tructions from me to be given to Clarke: after which we quitted the be&s;t parlour, into which we had been intro|duced with great ceremony to &s;up; and I retired to try how &s;oundly I could &s;leep, in one of the good beds of a lock-up hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. MORNING VISITORS. A GENEROUS PROPOSAL RE|JECTED. THE AFFECTIONATE FRIENDSHIP OF MISS WILMOT. A VERY UNEXPECTED VISITOR. HIS EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT, AND A SCENE OF RECONCILIATION. A LETTER WHICH EXCITES DELIGHTFUL SENSATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning came, the diligence of Mr. Hilary was that of a friend, and the be&s;t parlour was &s;oon filled: the reader will ea&s;ily gue&s;s by whom. There is an unde&s;cribable plea&s;ure, when we are per|&s;ecuted
<PB N="174" REF="178">
by one &s;et of human beings, to re|ceive marks of affection from another. It is a &s;trong con&s;olation to know that kindne&s;s and ju&s;tice have not wholly for|&s;aken the earth.</P>
<P>Wilmot, Clarke, and Turl were with me. I called for breakfa&s;t; and felt a gratification at enjoying another &s;ocial meal, before being immured in I knew not what kind of dungeon. Charlotte and her maid, Pol, were very alert; and I believe &s;he almo&s;t repented that I was not in the drawing-room, &s;ince &s;he found I had &s;o many friends.</P>
<P>Clarke was a&s;ked to partake; but an|&s;wered with a "no thank you, Mr. Tre|vor." I &s;uppo&s;ed it was awkward ba&s;h|fulne&s;s. I did him wrong. He had a more refined and feeling motive: for, when I pre&s;&s;ed him very earne&s;tly, he re|plied&mdash;" At another time, Mr. Trevor, &s;uch a favour would make me happy; and you know I have not refu&s;ed; but, ju&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="179">
now, why it would look as if, becau&s;e you are under misfortunes, I might take li|berties."</P>
<P>Hone&s;t-hearted generous fellow! He was &s;till the &s;ame. But he breakfa&s;ted with us. Be a&s;&s;ured, good reader, he breakfa&s;ted with us.</P>
<P>And now I had a conte&s;t to undergo, which was maintained with &s;o much ob|&s;tinacy that it became truly painful. Wilmot, in con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;s of his comedy, had the power to di&s;|charge my debt; and on this at fir&s;t he peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted. But it was what I could not accept. He was, I knew, an Evelyn in &s;oul: but I too panted to be &s;omething. I could not endure to rob him of the labour of a life, and walk at large oppre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of impotence: of a depre&s;&s;ed and &s;unken &s;pirit; of which groveling meanne&s;s would be the chief feature. Such at lea&s;t
<PB N="176" REF="180">
were my &s;en&s;ations: and they were too impetuous to be overcome.</P>
<P>In the ardour we mutually felt, Turl was appealed to by both. At fir&s;t he &s;trongly inclined to the &s;ide of Wilmot: but, hearing my rea&s;ons and perceiving the angui&s;h which the propo&s;al gave, he at length &s;aid&mdash;"Let us pau&s;e awhile. We are friends. Impri&s;onment is a de|te&s;table thing; and there is no danger that, as friends, we &s;hould &s;uffer each other to endure it long, if there &s;hould be any po&s;&s;ible and hone&s;t means of im|parting freedom. We need make no profe&s;&s;ions. In one part of his argument, Mr. Trevor is undoubtedly right. If he can relieve him&s;elf, by his abilities and in|du&s;try, which he is per&s;uaded he can, it is his duty. For it will not only increa&s;e his immediate happine&s;s, but it will give confidence to his efforts, and &s;trength to his mind: qualities that are ine&s;timable.
<PB N="177" REF="181">
Impediments &s;erve but to rou&s;e the man of genius. To reject aid from a &s;enti|ment of haughtine&s;s is a vice: but to de|&s;pair of our own re&s;ources is the death of all true greatne&s;s of character. In any ca&s;e, &s;u&s;pend your conte&s;t; in which, though from the be&s;t of motives, you are both too warm. Examine your argu|ments at lei&s;ure. If Mr. Trevor can be rendered mo&s;t happy and u&s;eful by ac|cepting your offer, it will then be ju&s;t in him to cede. but remember once more we are friends, that know each other's worth; and it will be ju&s;t that I &s;hould partake in his relea&s;e. To this I know you will both joyfully con&s;ent. If good can be done, you will not deny me my &s;hare!"</P>
<P>It was characteri&s;tic of Turl never to &s;peak on &s;erious occa&s;ions without leav|ing a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his hearers. Wilmot heaved a profound &s;igh, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182">Having thus far prevailed, I was de|&s;irous of being immediately removed to pri&s;on: but to this they both vehemently objected. It had an air of o&s;tentation: of affecting to love mi&s;ery for mi&s;ery's &s;ake. Time ought to be taken for con|&s;ideration; and evil &s;hould not be &s;port|ed with, though when unavoidable it ought to be endured with fortitude.</P>
<P>While the&s;e debates took place, it was no unintere&s;ting &s;pectacle to contemplate the changes in the countenance of Clarke. Before the adventure of Bath, he had ri&s;en much above the level of his companions: but now, when he &s;aw a man willing to part with all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to re&s;cue another from pri&s;on, and heard &s;trong rea&s;ons why it was probable the offer ought not to be accepted, his feelings were all in arms. His pa&s;&s;ions, while Wilmot plead|ed, were ready to break their bounds; and, when he li&s;tened to the an&s;wers that were returned, his mind was filled and
<PB N="179" REF="183">
expanded. He di&s;covered that there is a di&s;intere&s;ted grandeur in morality, of which he had no previous conception. He was in a new world; and a dark room, with barred windows, was heaven in all its &s;plendor.</P>
<P>Having agreed to follow their advice, Wilmot and Turl left me; with a pro|mi&s;e to return early in the evening: but poor Clarke &s;aid "he had no heart for work that day; and he could not abide to leave me &s;hut up by my&s;elf. He &s;aw plainly enough I had true friends; &s;uch as would never for&s;ake me: and no more would he, though he could do me no good." When however I repre&s;ented to him my wi&s;h to be alone, that I might con|&s;ider on my &s;ituation, and reque&s;ted he would dine with his family, and bring &s;ome books from my lodgings in the evening, he complied.</P>
<P>The morning of the day was chiefly con&s;umed; and I was not &s;uffered long
<PB N="180" REF="184">
to remain alone. I had &s;carcely dined before a coach &s;topped at the door, and Charlotte came in with demure &s;ignifi|cance in her face. "There is a young lady, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "<HI>which</HI> &s;ays her name is Wilmot, <HI>which</HI> wants to &s;ee you."</P>
<P>At this moment, &s;he was the mo&s;t agreeable vi&s;itor, that could have arrived. Her heart was full, her eyes were &s;wollen, and red with weeping, and, as &s;oon as &s;he entered the room, &s;he again bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>It has often been a&s;ked why &s;orrows like the&s;e &s;hould excite &s;o much gratifi|cation? The an&s;wer is evident. They are not only tokens of per&s;onal re&s;pect and affection, but they are proofs that inju&s;tice cannot be committed without being perceptibly and often deeply felt by others, as well as by tho&s;e on whom it is exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>When &s;he had appea&s;ed her feelings &s;ufficiently to be able to &s;peak, I found
<PB N="181" REF="185">
that, like her brother, &s;he was come with a di&s;intere&s;ted plan for my relief. She began by blaming her&s;elf for not having &s;trenuou&s;ly enough oppo&s;ed my forbear|ance with re&s;pect to Wakefield; and pleaded with great energy of feeling to per&s;uade me immediately to do my&s;elf right. I took the fir&s;t favourable oppor|tunity to interrupt her; and enquired if &s;he had &s;een or heard any thing of Wake|field &s;ince the letter he wrote? She an|&s;wered, he had been with her above an hour that very morning.</P>
<P>"In what temper of mind was he?"</P>
<P>"Extremely exa&s;perated."</P>
<P>"Not at you?"</P>
<P>"Oh no: at Lord Bray: at your per|&s;ecutors: at the world in general. He &s;ays you are not fit to live in it: you are no match for it. You have been per|&s;uading him, contrary to all hi&s;tory and experience, that men are capable of vir|tue and happine&s;s. In &s;hort, he owns
<PB N="182" REF="186">
that he was more than half convinced: but that he believes he &s;hall be obliged to relap&s;e into his former opinions."</P>
<P>"I have per&s;uaded him?"</P>
<P>"So he &s;ays."</P>
<P>"When? Where?"</P>
<P>"I cannot tell. I thought from his di&s;cour&s;e that he had met with you."</P>
<P>While we were engaged in this con|ver&s;ation, Charlotte again entered; and told me there was a gentleman of the name of Wakefield, who de&s;ired to &s;ee me. "Is it po&s;&s;ible?" exclaimed Mi&s;s Wilmot.</P>
<P>The door opened, and he appeared. "Belmont!" cried I, with &s;urpri&s;e. "Why did you announce your&s;elf by the name of Wakefield?"</P>
<P>He &s;tretched out his hand to me, and turned his face a&s;ide: then recovering him&s;elf replied "The farce is over."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?"</P>
<P>"That I &s;uppo&s;e you will de&s;pi&s;e me.
<PB N="183" REF="187">
But do, if you plea&s;e: for, though I love you, I too de&s;pi&s;e to fear you. I have done you various wrongs. My name is Wakefield. I have been one of the in|fernal in&s;truments to bring you here: but I am come to make you all the atone|ment in my power, and take you out. Forgive me only &s;o far as not to in&s;ult me, by repeating your contempt of that villain Wakefield. It is a damned un|dige&s;tible term: but I de&s;erved it; and you applied it to me without intending an affront. I know you are as brave as you are generous. Till I met with you, I thought my&s;elf the fir&s;t man in the world: but, notwith&s;tanding my evasive raillery, I felt your hand upon me. I &s;unk under you. There was &s;omething in you that excited my envy, at fir&s;t; and afterward, perhaps, a better pa&s;&s;ion. What damned accidents they were that made me what I have been I cannot tell. I know not what I &s;hall be: but I know
<PB N="184" REF="188">
what I am. I di&s;dain penitential pro|mi&s;es. If you will be my friend, here is my hand. Good fortune or bad, we will &s;hare it together."</P>
<P>Thus invited, could I refrain? Oh no. I cannot de&s;cribe the &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed. We did not embrace, for we were no actors; and, as our pa&s;&s;ions for a time were too big for utterance, we were &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot at length looked up; and, while the tears were &s;treaming down her cheeks, her countenance a&s;&s;umed an expre&s;&s;ion infinitely beyond &s;miling, though &s;omething like it, while &s;he ex|claimed&mdash;"This is a happy day!"</P>
<P>Her eye fir&s;t met mine, and then Wakefield's. He in&s;tantly hung his head, and &s;aid&mdash;"Lydia! When we were alone, I could ju&s;t endure to look at you: but now I cannot. Yet I am an a&s;s. What is done is done. The affections that I have are yours: but
<PB N="185" REF="189">
I mu&s;t not, no nor I will not be afraid, even of my own thoughts. I know I have nothing to fear from you. Man is a &s;trange animal; and may be many things in the cour&s;e of a &s;hort life."</P>
<P>Wakefield then rang the bell, and de|&s;ired the bailiff would &s;end immediately to Lord Bray's attorney; that my debts might be &s;ettled, and I relea&s;ed; and to call, as he knew they mu&s;t for form's &s;ake, and &s;ee that there were no more detainders.</P>
<P>Hearing him give the&s;e directions, I could not but a&s;k his meaning? "What," replied he, with generous indignation, "do you &s;uppo&s;e that I am come to cant about virtue? That, at lea&s;t, is a vice of which you have never yet found me guilty. I am here to pay your debts, with money in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Whether, in a court of law, it would be proved to be yours or mine I neither know nor care. But there is &s;omething better that
<PB N="186" REF="190">
I do know: which is that, if I were in your place and you in mine, you would not long let me remain in a hou&s;e like this. With re&s;pect to the future, I am partly per&s;uaded we &s;hall neither of us act the mi&s;er."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot again exclaimed&mdash;"This is a happy day!"</P>
<P>Wakefield was impatient to &s;ee me relea&s;ed; and was well acquainted with bailiffs. "If you are expeditious," &s;aid he to George, "you will have a guinea for your indu&s;try. If you are dilatory, not a farthing more than your fees."</P>
<P>The promi&s;ed guinea gave the me&s;|&s;enger wings; and in le&s;s than an hour the debt was di&s;charged, and a receipt in full delivered.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as this account was clo&s;ed, another me&s;&s;enger came from a different quarter. The anxiety of Mi&s;s Wilmot had in|duced her to take a bold &s;tep. In the fir&s;t emotions of grief, &s;he wrote to Oli|via;
<PB N="187" REF="191">
and informed her of every circum|&s;tance, as well as of the place of my detention. This information produced the following letter, and the bills in|clo&s;ed; as mentioned in its contents.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I have no words to &s;peak my feelings. I have never yet had an opportunity, &s;ince I thought the love I bear you ju&s;tifiable, to declare them. This is the time. To be &s;ilent now would argue a di&s;tru&s;t of you, which would degrade me; and ren|der me unworthy both of you and the dignified virtues by which your conduct is guided. Every new fact that I hear of you does but increa&s;e that affection; which I find ennobled by being &s;o wor|thily placed. After the proofs you have &s;o repeatedly given, it would be cowardice and hypocri&s;y to &s;ay le&s;s.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you five hundred pounds. They are my own. I would &s;ooner even &s;ee you &s;uffer than be guilty of an action which I know you could not approve.
<PB N="188" REF="192">
They are what I have re&s;erved, from money allowed me, to be employed on any urgent occa&s;ion. Surely there can be few more urgent than the pre&s;ent. Your refu&s;al of them would wound me to the &s;oul. It would break my heart. I need not add any thing more.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Who will tell me that virtue is not its own reward? Who will affirm that to conquer &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires, to render the pa&s;|&s;ions &s;ub&s;ervient to rea&s;on, and to make tho&s;e principles we commend in others rules for our&s;elves, is not the way to be happy? The tide of joy was full to over|flowing! And yet, when I recollected that, though no longer a pri&s;oner it was denied me to obey the yearnings of my heart and pa&s;s the thre&s;hold of Olivia, how &s;uddenly did it ebb!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. A JOURNEY TO AID HECTOR ONCE MORE PRO|JECTED. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WOUNDED STRANGER. A DISCOVERY OF GREAT IMPORT|ANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL forbear to repeat the joy and congratulations of friends, with other le&s;s events; and ha&s;ten to one which gave a more &s;urpri&s;ing turn to my affairs than even any that I had yet experienced. The morning after my relea&s;e, it was my intention to go down into the county of * * * *: agreeable to the de&s;ire of Hector. Of this I informed Mr. Hi|lary, the evening before: but, as I was become very cautious in money matters, I meant to go by the coach.</P>
<P>When he heard this, Mr. Hilary &s;miled: and told me, if I would go po&s;t, he believed he could find me a compa|nion, who would willingly bear half the expence.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="194">I enquired who? and found it was no other that the &s;tranger. He had been down into Cambridge&s;hire, to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs; and was now preparing for a journey into my native county, for pur|po&s;es which he will him&s;elf pre&s;ently ex|plain. A propo&s;al more agreeable than this could not have been made to me; and it was agreed that we &s;hould meet and breakfa&s;t with Mr. Hilary. When I made the appointment, Mr. Hilary pre&s;&s;ed me with unu&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s not to be induced to break it, by any acci|dent whatever.</P>
<P>The morning came, I was punctual, and the &s;tranger was there. He had &s;lept at the hou&s;e of Mr. Hilary. "This, &s;ir," &s;aid the latter, pre&s;enting me, "is the young gentleman of who&s;e acquaint|ance you are &s;o very de&s;irous."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger regarded me earne&s;tly; and, with great emotion in his counte|nance, a&s;ked&mdash;"Are you, &s;ir, the hu|mane
<PB N="191" REF="195">
per&s;on, who found me almo&s;t ex|piring; and by who&s;e care I am now among the living?"</P>
<P>"I hope, &s;ir, you do not think there was any thing extraordinary in what I did?"</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h I had not rea&s;on &s;o to think. How many there are who, from mean and &s;elfi&s;h motives, would have pa&s;&s;ed me I cannot &s;ay: but there are few in|deed that would have di&s;charged the office you undertook with &s;o much un|affected and generous benevolence. I am in your debt, &s;ir, not only for my recovery, for which I can never repay you, but literally for money expended. I &s;hall forbear thanks, for I have none that are adequate; but &s;uffer me to rid my&s;elf of petty obligations."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand, &s;ir, that you are rich, and I am not. I therefore inform you, without he&s;itation, I left twenty pounds with the phy&s;ician."</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="196">"You may well &s;uppo&s;e that I re|turned, after my recovery, to enquire for my pre&s;erver. I was then informed of your whole proceedings; and of the anxiety with which, after your journey, you came to complete the charitable office you had begun. And I own, &s;ir, that I was &s;o de&s;irous of &s;eeing a per&s;on who, in the very fervour of youth, could act and feel as you have done that, one excepted, you are the man on earth I am mo&s;t happy to meet."</P>
<P>"Mr. Hilary tells me that we are to be travelling companions."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly. I have long been a wanderer, and am lately returned to end my days in my native land. During my ab&s;ence, the elder branches of my family are all decea&s;ed. I brought back with me more than &s;ufficient for my own wants: but their property has de&s;cended to me, and I now very unexpectedly find my&s;elf wealthy."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="197">"And have you no de&s;cendants, &s;ir?"</P>
<P>"None. I am at pre&s;ent in &s;earch of a di&s;tant relation: whom if I &s;hould find, and find him &s;uch as my pre&s;ent hopes and pa&s;t knowledge have pictured him, I &s;hall be one of the happie&s;t of men. To make this and another enquiry is the purpo&s;e of the journey I now mean to take. When I left England, I had no intention ever to return: I therefore re&s;olved to hold no corre&s;pondence with the per&s;ons whom I had left; that I might not revive the memory of &s;cenes and events which had been full of an|gui&s;h. By accident, about eighteen months ago, being then at Grand Cairo I was informed that a per&s;on of my fa|mily had long been dead. This deter|mined me to &s;ettle my concerns abroad, and revi&s;it my native country. As how|ever my informer &s;poke only from re|port, I am de&s;irous, before I make my&s;elf known, to verify this fact. I have my rea&s;ons; which, from what I have &s;aid,
<PB N="194" REF="198">
you may &s;u&s;pect to be tho&s;e of re&s;ent|ment. But not &s;o; they are only what I conceive to be nece&s;&s;ary precautions. Acrimony and anger have long &s;ince died away; and I have but too much cau&s;e to condemn tho&s;e actions of my life in which they were indulged. The relation, whom I hope to find, I may unfortunately di&s;cover to be more likely to mi&s;u&s;e the wealth, that has devolved to me by the death of the elder branches of my family, than to make it a ble&s;&s;ing to him&s;elf and others. It is true he is not my heir at law. I have no heir: what I po&s;&s;e&s;s is at my own di&s;po&s;al. But he was once my greate&s;t favourite: and I would avoid any action that &s;hould excite hopes which it might be weakne&s;s and vice in me to gratify."</P>
<P>This &s;hort narrative was not merely delivered with a &s;erious air; but it was accompanied with &s;omewhat of a plain|tive tone, that rendered the venerable &s;tranger unu&s;ually intere&s;ting. It like|wi&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="199">
excited various wild yet not impo&s;|&s;ible conjectures in my mind, which made me very eager to pur&s;ue the di&s;cour&s;e. Mr. Hilary, who&s;e mind had been full of con|jectures mingled with doubt, had not in|formed him of my name.</P>
<P>"Is the per&s;on," &s;aid I, "in &s;earch of whom you mean to take this journey young, or old?"</P>
<P>"About four and twenty. He was the &s;on of my wife's &s;i&s;ter; therefore my relation only by marriage. He was cer|tainly the mo&s;t extraordinary child I ever beheld. I cannot recollect him but with inconceivable emotions of affection. Of all the &s;portive little creatures I ever met with, he was the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t undaunted, and the mo&s;t winning. Hea|ven ble&s;s the &s;weet boy! He was my delight. My eyes overflow whenever I recall to mind the &s;eats of his childhood, which can never be long forgotten by me. My wife and her &s;i&s;ter had been at va|riance, and the fir&s;t time I &s;aw him was at
<PB N="196" REF="200">
a fair; when he was not five years old. I found him placed on a table, where he &s;tood reading the new&s;paper to country farmers; who were collected round him, and hearing him with a&s;toni&s;hment. They &s;eemed to doubt if he could po&s;|&s;ibly be a child, born of a woman; and were more inclined to think him a &s;u|pernatural being. His flaxen curly hair, his intelligent eyes, his ro&s;y cheeks, his &s;trong and proportioned limbs, and his cheerful animated countenance, rendered him the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t endear|ing of human creatures. The di&s;crimi|nating &s;en&s;ibility which he di&s;played was enchanting. Oh &s;hould he be living, &s;hould I find him, and &s;hould he be at pre&s;ent all that his infancy promi&s;ed. God of heaven and earth! I &s;hould expire. The plea&s;ure would be too mighty for my years. But, &s;hould I &s;urvive it, I &s;hould once again before I die feel the animating fervor of youth.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="201">I li&s;tened in amazement. I was not then acquainted with all the incidents of my childhood &s;o perfectly as, by hearing them repeated, I &s;ince have been: but I knew enough of them to be per&s;uaded the di&s;cour&s;e that I had heard could re|late only to me. I pau&s;ed. I gazed. My eyes were riveted upon the narrator. At length I exclaimed&mdash;"What I have ju&s;t heard, &s;ir, has excited very &s;trange ideas. They &s;eem almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible: and yet I am per&s;uaded they are true. Pardon a que&s;tion which I cannot refrain to a&s;k. Surely I cannot be mi&s;taken! Your name is Elford?"</P>
<P>"Sir!"</P>
<P>"You are my&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Speak! Go on! What am I?"</P>
<P>"My uncle!"</P>
<P>"Heavens! Mr. Trevor! Is that your name?"</P>
<P>"It is."</P>
<P>"Oh! God! Oh! God! Oh! God!
<PB N="198" REF="202">
&mdash;Hugh! Little Hugh! My boy! My &s;weet boy!"</P>
<P>Mr. Elford was almo&s;t overcome. In a moment he again cried&mdash;"My &s;aviour too! Still the &s;ame! Courageous, hu|mane, generous! All that my &s;oul could de&s;ire! Oh &s;hield me, deliver me from this exce&s;s of joy!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE event only excepted, little remains to be told of my &s;tory; and that one is doubtle&s;s anticipated by the imagination of the reader. To de&s;cribe the enquiries that pa&s;&s;ed between me and my uncle, the various fortunes we had encountered, and the feelings they excited, would be to write his hi&s;tory and tediou&s;ly repeat my own. My difficulties now di&s;appeared. I was the acknowledged heir of a man of great wealth: therefore, I my&s;elf am become a great man. Heaven pre&s;erve
<PB N="199" REF="203">
me from becoming indolent, proud, and oppre&s;&s;ive! I have not yet forgotten that oppre&s;&s;ion exi&s;ts, that pride is its chief coun&s;ellor, that activity and u&s;efulne&s;s are the &s;acred duties of both rich and poor, that the wealth entru&s;ted to my di&s;tribution is the property of tho&s;e whom mo&s;t it can benefit, that I am a creature of very few wants, but that tho&s;e few in others as well as in my&s;elf are imperious, and that I have felt them in all their ri|gour. Neither have I yet &s;hut my doors on one of my former friends. But I am comparatively young in pro&s;perity. How long I &s;hall be able to per&s;evere in this eccentric conduct time mu&s;t tell. At pre&s;ent I mu&s;t proceed, and mention the few remaining circum&s;tances with which the reader may wi&s;h to be acquainted.</P>
<P>After my uncle had heard me de&s;cribe Olivia, and mention the motives which induced me to wi&s;h to aid her brother, he immediately determined on taking the journey we had before propo&s;ed. We
<PB N="200" REF="204">
neither of us wi&s;hed to &s;eparate. Robu&s;t in "a green old age," he had no fear of fatigue from travelling this di&s;tance; and it would be a plea&s;ure to revi&s;it, in my company, &s;cenes which would bring my former &s;ports and pranks to his recollec|tion. He heard from me a confirmation of the death of Mrs. Elford; and heard it with the &s;ame tokens of melancholy in his face which he had betrayed, when he &s;poke of her him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That I &s;hould have wi&s;hed before I took this journey, &s;hort as it was, to have &s;een Olivia, related all my good fortune and partaken in the plea&s;ure it would ex|cite in her, may well be imagined: but forms, and delicacies, and I know not what habitual feelings, forbad me the en|joyment of this premature bli&s;s. I wrote however, and not only to her but to tho&s;e tried and invaluable friends who were not to be neglected.</P>
<P>We found Hector in a lamentable &s;tate. In&s;tead of the bluff robu&s;t form,
<PB N="201" REF="205">
which but &s;hortly before he had worn, his limbs were &s;hrunk, his cheeks for|merly of a high red were wan and hol|low, his voice was gone, his lungs were affected, and his cough was ince&s;&s;ant. He had him&s;elf at la&s;t begun to think his life in danger; and was preparing to return to town for advice: con&s;equently our &s;tay was &s;hort. His reception of me however was friendly. The increa&s;ing debility which he felt &s;oftened his man|ners; and, when he under&s;tood the good fortune that had befallen me, he &s;eemed &s;incerely to rejoice.</P>
<P>And now let me reque&s;t the reader to call to mind, not only my fir&s;t emotions of love for Olivia, and the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion that preyed upon me while &s;truggling between hope and de&s;pair, but tho&s;e late te&s;timonies of affection, &s;uch as a mind &s;o dignified as hers could be&s;tow; and then let him imagine what our meeting mu&s;t be. Should he ex|pect me to de&s;cribe her, &s;uch as the was
<PB N="202" REF="206">
and is, in all her attractions, all her beauties, and all her various excellence, he expects an impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k. To be beloved by her, to be found worthy of her, and to call her mine, are ble&s;&s;ings that infinitely exceed momentary rap|ture: they are la&s;ting and indubitable happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I know not if it will give him plea&s;ure to be told that, could I have delighted in revenge, I might have &s;atiated my&s;elf with that unworthy and de&s;tructive pa&s;|&s;ion. The committee, appointed to de|cide on the election, voted the Idford candidate guilty of bribery and corrup|tion. The fortune of the Earl, like that of Hector, has &s;uffered depredations which half a century will probably not repair. The new made peer and his party daily became &s;o obnoxious to the nation, by the de&s;tructive tendency of their mea|&s;ures, that they were and continue to be haunted by terrors that deprive them of the faculties common to man. My heart
<PB N="203" REF="207">
bears witne&s;s for me that I do not &s;peak this in triumph. I &s;hould be no le&s;s vici|ous than unworthy, could I triumph in the misfortunes of any human being: but I were a wretch indeed, were I to make mi&s;takes that are the &s;courge of mankind a &s;ubject of exultation.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I repeat more names? Is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay the virtues of Turl and Wilmot are too &s;plendid to need my prai&s;e: or that my &s;ocial hours are mo&s;t beneficially and delightfully &s;pent in their &s;ociety? That I have amply provided for the generous minded Clarke? That Phi|lip is once more the good and faithful &s;ervant of a kind mi&s;tre&s;s? That Mary and her &s;on are equally objects of my at|tention? And that I do not mean to boa&s;t of the&s;e things as acts of munificence: but as the performance of duties?</P>
<P>This were unnece&s;&s;ary. Neither &s;hall I be required to particularize the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of Lydia, now Mrs. Wakefield; and of that man of brilliant and a&s;toni&s;h|ing
<PB N="204" REF="208">
faculties who is her affectionate com|panion and friend, and from who&s;e exer|tions, if I am not &s;trangely mi&s;taken, the world has &s;o much to profit and &s;o much to expect. Like me, he is in the enjoy|ment of affluence; and he enjoys it with a liberal and munificent &s;pirit. Are there any who hate him, becau&s;e he once was guilty of hateful crimes? I hope not. It is a &s;pirit that would &s;weep away half the inhabitants of the "peopled earth." For my own part, I delight in his conver&s;ation, am enlivened by his wit, and prompt|ed to enquiry by the acutene&s;s of his remarks. He is a man whom I am proud to &s;ay I love.</P>
<P>I have told my tale. If it &s;hould af|ford in&s;truction, if it &s;hould in&s;pire a love of virtue, briefly, if it &s;hould contribute to the happine&s;s of mankind, I &s;hall have gained my purpo&s;e. My labours will be mo&s;t richly rewarded.</P>
