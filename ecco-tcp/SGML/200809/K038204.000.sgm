<L>LADIES and Gentlemen, <HI>I'll tell you what!</HI></L>
<L>Yet not, like antient Prologue, tell the Plot;</L>
<L>But, like a modern Prologue, try each way</L>
<L>To win your Favour tow'rds the coming Play.</L>
<L>Our Author, is a Woman&mdash;that's a Charm</L>
<L>Of Power to guard her&s;elf and Play from harm.</L>
<L>The Mu&s;es, Ladies Regent of the Pen,</L>
<L>Grant Women Skill, and Force, to write like Men.</L>
<L>Yet they, like the AEolian Maid of old,</L>
<L>Their Sex's Character will ever hold:</L>
<L>Not with bold Quill too roughly &s;trike the Lyre,</L>
<L>But with the <HI>Feather</HI> rai&s;e a &s;oft De&s;ire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Poete&s;s has gain'd &s;ublime&s;t heights:</L>
<L>Not Sapho's Self has &s;oar'd to nobler Flights;</L>
<L>For &s;he, bright Spirit, the fir&s;t Briti&s;h Fair,</L>
<L>Climb'd unappall'd, the un&s;ub&s;tantial Air;</L>
<L>And here, beneath the Changes of the Moon,</L>
<L>Wond'ring you &s;aw her launch a grand Balloon; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Farce of the "Mogul Tale, or De&s;cent of the Balloon," produced the Year before by the Authose&s;s.</NOTE></L>
<L>While &s;he with steady Cour&s;e, and Flight not dull,</L>
<L>Paid a &s;hort Vi&s;it to the Great Mogul.</L>
<L>Shrink not, Nabobs! Our Poete&s;s to-night</L>
<L>Wakes not the Genius of Sir Matthew Mite.</L>
<L>Beyond our Hemi&s;phere &s;he will not roam,</L>
<L>Keeps in the Line, and touches nearer Home;</L>
<L>Nay will not, as before, howe'er you &s;corn her,</L>
<L>Reach e'en the Turnpike-gate at Hyde Park Corner.</L>

<L>MALE Criticks applaud to the Skies the Male Scribblers&mdash;</L>
<L>When a Woman attempts, they turn Carpers and Nib|blers;</L>
<L>But a true Patriot Female, there's nothing &s;o vexes.</L>
<L>As this haughty Pre-eminence claim'd'twixt the Sexes.</L>
<L>The free Spirit revolts at each hard Propo&s;ition,</L>
<L>And meets the whole Sy&s;tem with loud Oppo&s;ition.</L>
<L>Men, 'tis true, in their Noddles huge Trea&s;ures may hoard,</L>
<L>But the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Woman with Pa&s;&s;ions is &s;tor'd.</L>
<L>With Pa&s;&s;ions not copied from Latin or Greek,</L>
<L>Which the Language of Nature in plain Engli&s;h &s;peak.</L>
<L>Girls who grieve, or rejoice, from true Feeling, as I do,</L>
<L>Never dream of Calyp&s;o, or Helen, or Dido.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the End of our Life, from the Hour we begin it,</L>
<L>Woman's Fate all depends on the Critical Minute.</L>
<L>A Minute unknown to the dull Pedant Tribe,</L>
<L>And which never feeling, they never de&s;cribe.</L>
<L>'Tis no Work of Science, or Sparkle of Wit,</L>
<L>But a Point which mere Nature mu&s;t teach us to hit;</L>
<L>And which, in the Changes and Turns of my Story,</L>
<L>A weak Woman's Pen has to-night laid before ye.</L>
<L>And &s;ay, ye grave Prudes! Gay Coquettes too, ah &s;ay,</L>
<L>What a Critical Minute was mine in the Play!</L>
<L>Here Poverty, Famine, and Shame, and Reproach;</L>
<L>There Plenty and Ea&s;e, and a Lord and a Coach.</L>
<L>But perhaps our Bard held Mrs. Eu&s;ton too mean,</L>
<L>And conceiv'd her Di&s;grace wou'd but lower the Scene;</L>
<L>Let us then, better pleas'd to acquit than convict her,</L>
<L>On the Ground of High Life, &s;ketch the very &s;ame Pic|ture!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagine &s;ome Fair, plung'd in modi&s;h Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Her Wants not le&s;s than mine, nor her Agony le&s;s.</L>
<L>At Hazard, &s;uppo&s;e, an unfortunate Ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Has &s;wept her la&s;t Guinea, nay, more than her la&s;t.</L>
<L><PB REF="6">Her Diamonds all mortgag'd, her Equipage &s;old,</L>
<L>Her Hu&s;band undone, genteel Friends looking cold;</L>
<L>At her Feet his &s;weet Per&s;on, Lord Foppington throws,</L>
<L>The mo&s;t hand&s;ome of Nobles, the riche&s;t of Beaux!</L>
<L>At once too his Love and his Bounty di&s;pen&s;es,</L>
<L>Sooths with Thou&s;ands her Grief, lulls with Flatt'ry her Sen&s;es.</L>
<L>Alas, what a Minute! Ah! What can be done?</L>
<L>All Means mu&s;t be tried, and our Drama &s;hews one.</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute, that &s;o frowns upon her,</L>
<L>Redeem the vile Debts that encumber her Honour!</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute that teems with undoing,</L>
<L>Step in like my Father, and marr a Lord's wooing!</L>
<L>Let her know, as I've known, all the Horror that's in it,</L>
<L>And feel the true Force of the Critical Minute!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus wi&s;hes our Bard, as &s;he bids me declare;</L>
<L>And &s;uch is my Wi&s;h, by my <HI>Honour</HI> I &s;wear.</L>

<P>Dear Uncle, I &s;hould certainly have a&s;ked your opinion and my Uncle An|thony's on the &s;ubject, but your ab&s;ence put it out of my power, and it was univer&s;ally believed the &s;hip in which you &s;ailed was lo&s;t.</P>

<P>I tru&s;t, Sir, when I have ex|plained every thing, you will not only think me worthy of your pardon but even of being plead|ed for to my Uncle.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed&mdash;Nay, were it in my power to do you any good, I wou'd not&mdash;I &s;han't forgive you my&s;elf&mdash;much le&s;s a&s;k him&mdash;But you are right in fixing on me for a mediator; my brother pays much regard to me truly&mdash;I have been of infinite &s;ervice, to be &s;ure, in reconciling him to his own poor boy. Nay, did he not even (for my brother Anthony would always be ma&s;|ter, although he was the younge&s;t) when I went to him to per&s;uade him to forgive poor Charles,
<PB N="3" REF="9">his &s;on, did he not even (in&s;tead of my gaining him over and getting &s;omething for the poor boy) did he not even draw me into a promi&s;e never to do any thing for him my&s;elf?&mdash;My bro|ther does what he plea&s;es with me&mdash;but nobody el&s;e &s;hall&mdash;No, what I want in re&s;olution, to him, I'll make up in ob&s;tinacy, to other peo|ple.</P>

<P>Sir, if you will but hear the ju&s;t pleas I have to offer&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will hear no pleas&mdash;What do you think my brother will &s;ay? Why you incon&s;i|derate boy! He had de&s;igned you for his heir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be as &s;orry, Sir, to excite his di&s;plea&s;ure as I am at incurring yours; yet, give me leave to add, I &s;hould derive very little enjoyment from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune which his &s;on, my poor cou&s;in, (but for a &s;ingle act of imprudence) had a right to expect. And be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that if this &s;eeming indi&s;cretion of mine, when compared with that of his &s;on's, &s;hou'd be regarded &s;o unfavorably as to make <HI>his</HI> offence appear lighter to my Uncle, and move him to forgivene&s;s&mdash;I will contentedly &s;upport the burthen of his re&s;entment.</P>

<P>Why now that's well &s;poken&mdash;You &s;illy young rogue, I am not angry with you for getting rid of your wife&mdash;(for that I dare &s;ay is what every &s;en&s;ible man in the world wou'd do, if he cou'd) I am only angry with you for getting another&mdash;Cou'd not you know when you were well off, you blockhead?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Uncle, as you are a bachelor, and can only &s;peak of wives from the|ory, &s;uppo&s;e we drop the &s;ubject?&mdash;Is my Uncle Anthony come to his hou&s;e? He knows no|thing of the alteration that has taken place in my family, you tell me.&mdash;Shou'd I wait on him, or do you think he will favor me with a vi&s;it fir&s;t?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now what a deal of cere|mony!&mdash;'Tis a fine thing to <HI>look</HI> like a man of con&s;equence. My brother Anthony has had more privilege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from his looks than I ever had from being elde&s;t &s;on&mdash;even you, whom I love &s;o well, and have given half my fortune to (and 'tis not long you know that you have expected a &s;ix pence from Anthony) yet you never meet <HI>him</HI> without a low bow. "How do you do Sir?&mdash;I hope you are well, Uncle!&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you!"&mdash;And you &s;tumble over <HI>me,</HI> with "So Uncle, how is it? how is it Uncle"&mdash;And when you in|vite us both, "Uncle Anthony, I hope I &s;hall have the <HI>honor</HI> of your company"&mdash;While you give me a nod, "Uncle, I &s;hall &s;ee you."</P>

<P>Dear Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, with every other per&s;on 'tis the &s;ame thing&mdash;If we are &s;tuffed into a coach, with a little chattering pert Mi&s;s, "Oh dear, Mr. Anthony Eu&s;ton, you mu&s;t not ride back|wards, here is room for <HI>you</HI> on this &s;eat&mdash;and <HI>Mr. Eu&s;ton,</HI> I know, will like one &s;eat as well as ano|ther"&mdash;ad then am I put with my back to the hor&s;es, though my head is whirling all the time
<PB N="5" REF="11">like one of the coach wheels. Then if any thing be lo&s;t, or wanted, when no &s;ervant is by, "Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> Eu&s;ton mu&s;t not &s;tir for the world&mdash;but <HI>Mr. Eu&s;ton,</HI> they know, will be &s;o kind as to go for it."&mdash;And this is all becau&s;e I am good na|tured. Egad! if this is my reward, no wonder there are &s;o few in the world of my temper.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir, no je&s;ting&mdash;Does my Uncle intend to call on me or not?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I dare &s;ay he <HI>did</HI> intend it; and, if he does not hear of what you have been doing, before he gets to your hou&s;e, he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my dear Uncle, will you &s;tep home, and give orders that none of the &s;ervants mention any thing to him this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now!&mdash;" <HI>I</HI> &s;tep home and give orders!" There 'tis, again!&mdash;Wou'd you a&s;k my brother to "&s;tep home, and give orders?" No, I fancy not!&mdash;But I&mdash;poor I&mdash;will be &s;o good as to do it you think&mdash;But for once I won't&mdash;Be&s;ides, Anthony never a&s;ks que&s;tions of &s;ervants. We enquired of our hou&s;e-keeper, indeed, how you did, la&s;t night; &s;he told us both you and your Lady were well, and &s;o we thought all &s;afe. Anthony will a&s;k no more que&s;tions, therefore you may have the plea&s;ure of explaining matters to him your&s;elf, as you have to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hou'd be &s;orry if any imper|fect account &s;hou'd reach him; for, &s;o &s;incere is my re&s;pect for him, I wou'd not even &s;uffer for
<PB N="6" REF="12">a moment in his e&s;teem. I will be with him in half an hour, but I am afraid&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he'll not be out, nor have had any company in that time&mdash;for my brother is no &s;ailor, and he'll be too fond of the exchange of a bed for a hammock to be &s;tirring &s;o &s;oon. However, I think I <HI>will</HI> &s;tep home and give a caution to the &s;ervants that they don't mention your divorce to him.&mdash;As for my|&s;elf, I'll keep out of his way&mdash;I'll not go near him&mdash;for I will &s;ay this for my brother, although it was never in my power to per&s;uade him to for|give an injury or an indi&s;cretion in my life, yet I never &s;aid to him, "Brother Anthony <HI>don't</HI> forgive a thing," that he did not take my ad|vice.</P>

<P>Well, Uncle, whether you &s;tay or go, I mu&s;t bid you a good morning, for I am obliged to attend a friend, who has a law&s;uit depending, and I fear I &s;hall be waited for&mdash;my pre&s;ence won't be required long, and I'll be with my Uncle Anthony within half an hour.</P>

<P>Nay, I beg your Lady&s;hip's pardon&mdash;I thought perhaps your Lady&s;hip wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Major &s;how him&s;elf a courageous gen|tleman in the field; and that that was the rea|&s;on of your pre&s;ering him to Sir George.</P>

<P>I prefer!

<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ungenerous man&mdash;even wor&s;e to me than Sir George&mdash;for poor Sir George, from my indi&s;creet partiality to this ingrate, had &s;ome pretence for his unkind ap|prehen&s;ions; but Mr. Cyprus, who knows what

He has behaved like a man of re&s;olution and &s;pirit in ca&s;ting me from his heart, and I feel the irreparable lo&s;s. Why were we divorced? I &s;hou'd have di&s;liked him &s;till had be been my hu&s;band; and yet how tender, how patient to my failings to what Mr. Cyprus is&mdash;His cruel and unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions of me are not to be borne.&mdash;How provokingly did he treat me la&s;t night&mdash;I was too tame&mdash;but the next time he in&s;ults me, with his jealou&s;y, I will endeavor to augment rather than pacify it&mdash;I'll try a rever&s;e of conduct&mdash;Though, indeed, I <HI>am</HI> tolerably provoking in all our wrangles:&mdash;yes, thank heaven, I can &s;ay as cool &s;piteful things as any woman in the world.</P>

<P>You wou'd throw away im|mediately in my &s;ervice&mdash;No, no, Sir George, a fond wife will never &s;uffer her hu&s;band to re|venge her wrongs at &s;o great a ri&s;k.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is as &s;evere a pun|ni&s;hment to men of gallantry (as they call them|&s;elves) as &s;word or pi&s;tol; laugh at them&mdash;that is a ball which cannot mi&s;s; and yet kills only their vanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee&mdash;we have been now only three months married; and, in that &s;hort time, I have had no le&s;s than five or &s;ix men of fa&s;hion to turn into ridicule.&mdash;The fir&s;t who ventured to declare his pa&s;&s;ion was Lord William Bloomly&mdash;his rank, joined to his un|common beauty, had in&s;ured him &s;ucce&s;s; and, wherever I went, I was certain to hear his di&s;|tre&s;s whi&s;pered in my ear&mdash;at every opportunity he fell even upon his knees; and, as a tender earne&s;t of my pity for him, begged, with all the eloquence of love, for "a &s;ingle lock of my
<PB N="50" REF="58">hair, which he wou'd value more than any other woman's per&s;on; the wealth of worlds; or (he is a great patriot you know) even the welfare of his country."</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am out of patience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will be more &s;o&mdash;For I promi&s;ed him this &s;ingle lock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I did&mdash;and added, with a blu&s;h, that I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on a few hairs from one of his eye-brows in return&mdash;which he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed;&mdash;and, on my urging it, was obliged to confe&s;s, "he valued that little brown arch more than the lock he had been begging for; con|&s;equently, more than any woman's per&s;on; the wealth of worlds; or even the welfare of his country."&mdash;I immediately circulated this anec|dote, and exhibited the gentleman, both as a gallant and a patriot; and now his Lord&s;hip's eye-brow, which was once the admiration, is be|come the ridicule of every drawing-room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip then wou'd not menace your lover?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not&mdash;"You are the mo&s;t beautiful woman I ever &s;aw," &s;aid Lord <HI>Bandy</HI>; "and your Lord&s;hip is po&s;itively the mo&s;t lovely of mankind"&mdash;"What eyes," cried he; "what hair," cried I; "what lips," con|tinued he; "what teeth," added I; "what a hand and arm," &s;aid he; "and what a <HI>leg</HI> and <HI>foot,</HI>" &s;aid I&mdash;"Your Lady&s;hip is je&s;ting," was
<PB N="51" REF="59">his Lord&s;hip's la&s;t reply; and he has never &s;ince even paid me one compliment. Prudes cen&s;ure my conduct&mdash;I am too free&mdash;while their favo|rite, Lady Strenuous, in another corner of the ball-room, cries to <HI>her</HI> admirer&mdash;"De&s;i&s;t, my Lord, or my dear Sir Charles &s;hall know that you dare thus to wound my ears with your li|centious pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;if you ever pre&s;ume to breath in again, I will acquaint him with it&mdash;depend upon it I will. <STAGE>(<HI>Sighs and langui&s;hes</HI>)</STAGE> Oh! you have de&s;troyed my peace of mind for ever."</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are too many &s;uch ladies, but no &s;uch wou'd I hazard my life for&mdash;that I have proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, upon my word, Sir George, even the virtuous wife, who wou'd not have &s;ome regard to her hu&s;band's <HI>life,</HI> as well as his <HI>honour,</HI> if I were a gentleman, I &s;hould not feel my&s;elf under many obligations to.</P>

And, indeed, Sir George, it is my fixed opinion that, the man who wou'd en|deavour to wrong a virtuous wife &s;hou'd be held too de&s;picable for the re&s;entment of the hu&s;band, and only worthy the deba&s;ement inflicted by our &s;ex. I have already &s;ent a letter to Sir Harry
<PB N="52" REF="60">with the appointment at the ma&s;querade, and the Major has my promi&s;e of a meeting at the &s;ame time&mdash;Come, come, Sir George, it is the fir&s;t petition I ever pre&s;ented; do not refu&s;e me!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me till the morning to con&s;ider of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart&mdash;and in the mean time reflect on this&mdash;that, in regard to your terrible &s;ex, whether as licentious lovers or valiant champions&mdash;women, of <HI>real honour,</HI> are not in danger from the one; and, therefore, like me, ought to forego the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other.</P>

<P>Why then, Colonel, with Lord Layton to-day (at who&s;e hou&s;e I dined)
<PB N="53" REF="61">a circum&s;tance happened on which account I expect his Lord&s;hip will call on me to-morrow for a fa&s;hionable &s;atisfaction; and though, de|pend upon it, I wi&s;h for no &s;uch ra&s;h means of ending a di&s;pute, yet, if his Lord&s;hip <HI>&s;hou'd</HI> call upon me, 'tis fit I be prepared with a &s;econd; and I thank you for the friendly a&s;&s;urance you have now given me of your &s;ervice.</P>

<P>You are as welcome to it&mdash;I was going to &s;ay, as my king&mdash;but, zounds, if I &s;hou'd be killed in a pitiful quarrel at home, I &s;hou'd blu&s;h even in my grave&mdash;for, when I die, I hope to have my knell rung by the groans of a &s;core or two of our country's treacherous foes.</P>

<P>The &s;ervice I &s;hall put you to, Colonel, will not prevent that hope.</P>

<P>Lord Layton and I had no &s;ooner plac'd our&s;elves in his Lord&s;hip's coach than he exclaim'd, he had ju&s;t &s;een the mo&s;t beautiful girl his eyes ever beheld, to whom he had given a look of &s;olicitation, and that &s;he was returning her an&s;wer by making up to the coach&mdash;He begged a thou&s;and pardons, but, with my permi&s;&s;ion, (as he ex|pected no other company at his country hou&s;e) he wou'd take her down to dine with us.&mdash;I, knowing his Lord&s;hip well, (and the girl being now arrived at the coach door) reluctantly a&s;|&s;ented, and &s;he was immediately handed in.</P>

<P>Had your Lady&s;hip not written this letter to the amiable Sir Harry Harmle&s;s, (which I unfortunately &s;uppo&s;ed in|tended for Major Cyprus) your Lady&s;hip's alarm|ing "apprehen&s;ions" might have been &s;pared, as I &s;ent for Sir George but to &s;hew him this letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that letter was only a joke&mdash;a &s;cheme to mortify the Major and Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o&mdash;I own it.&mdash;And the confu&s;ion the &s;cheme has occa&s;ioned, Sir George, needs all your forgivene&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;incerely pardon it&mdash;and hope the whole company will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that my &s;ole motive, for entering this hou&s;e, was a compliance with, what I then thought, the dying reque&s;t of that Lady.&mdash;And I now believe that her Lady&s;hip's &s;ole motive for wi&s;hing to &s;ee me was merely to &s;hew me the etter of which &s;he &s;peaks&mdash;a copy of which, not without my knowledge, but again&s;t my opinion, was written by Lady eu&s;ton to Major Cy|prus, appointing a fictitious interview, in return for his having dared to offend her with the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a licentious pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir George, I am perfectly &s;atisfied with this explantation.&mdash;But, after what has happened, the world may de&s;pi&s;e me for be|ing &s;o, and therefore, Lady Harriet, from this moment we &s;eparate&mdash;And we had been wifer, as well as happier, if we had never met.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t willingly &s;eparate&mdash;Your unkind treatment&mdash;and my own con&s;tant in|quietude&mdash;have long &s;ince taught a woman of the world too feelingly to acknowledge, "No la&s;ting friend&s;hip is form'd on vice."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preach this, my dear Lady, to all your fair countrywomen&mdash;enforce your words by your future conduct, and they &s;hall draw a veil over the frailty of your pa&s;t life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr.Anthony, cou'd I but retrieve my innocence, my honour, for ever lo&s;t!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, do not de&s;pair.&mdash;You can &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>one</HI> ine&s;timable good&mdash;that in|born
<PB N="88" REF="96">virtue which <HI>never peri&s;hes</HI>&mdash;which never leaves us but to return.&mdash;For, when you think it extingui&s;hed, feel but due remor&s;e and it ri&s;es again in the &s;oul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, brother Antho|ny&mdash;comfort her&mdash;it is your duty.&mdash;And we are all <HI>relations,</HI> you know&mdash;the whole company are related to one another.&mdash;Though it is in an odd kind of a jumbled way&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;ome learned gentleman, of the law, would tell us <HI>what</HI> rela|tions we all are&mdash;and what relation the child of a fir&s;t hu&s;band is to his mother's &s;econd hu&s;band, while his own father is living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, you think too deeply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, brother Anthony!&mdash;And, for fear the gentlemen of the long robe &s;hou'd not be able to find out the pre&s;ent company's <HI>affinity,</HI> let us apply to the <HI>kindred ties</HI> of each others pa&s;&s;ions, weakne&s;&s;es, and imperfec|tions; and, thereupon, agree to part, this evening, not only <HI>near relations</HI> but <HI>good friends.</HI></P>
