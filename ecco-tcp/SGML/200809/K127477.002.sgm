<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ON their arrival at Mr. Goldney's hou&s;e, that gentleman introduced him to his lady, "as a noble-minded &s;tran|ger, with whom he had made an acci|dental but a fortunate acquaintance, from di&s;covering, that one &s;oul united them, one hope animated, and, he tru&s;ted, would equally &s;timulate them to &s;ome glorious and daring acts for the advantage of their country, to pre&s;erve it from thraldom and di&s;|grace; &s;ince, to incite his country|men to follow the example of their
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Gallic neighbours was all he wi&s;h|ed for; and to die in this cau&s;e would give him a far greater degree of &s;atisfaction, than to live peace|ably but ignobly, &s;urrounded by &s;laves and va&s;&s;als."</P>
<P>Mrs. Goldney, accu&s;tomed to the&s;e rants, heard him with the utmo&s;t indifference, and, curt&s;eying coldly to our hero, &s;urveyed him with the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing attention. The fact was, &s;he did not love &s;tran|gers; and, pre&s;uming on her &s;upe|rior penetration (a quality in which &s;he was particularly defective), al|ways &s;u&s;pected people had &s;ome hid|den motive for their mo&s;t trivial ac|tions.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
The look which &s;he now gave Sir George, if tran&s;lated, would have expre&s;&s;ed: "What brought you hi|ther? No good, I doubt. I do not love the&s;e &s;udden friend&s;hips: there is always &s;ome meaning in them which even my judgment cannot pe|netrate."</P>
<P>The Baronet, of who&s;e acute di&s;|cernment we have yet given very little proof, entirely uncon&s;cious of her &s;u&s;picions, returned her cool ad|dre&s;s with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s. They were now &s;ummoned to &s;upper, when a more general conver&s;ation en&s;ued. That, however, &s;oon gave way to their favourite topic; and it la&s;ted until a
<PB N="4" REF="5">
very late hour. Mrs. Goldney dur|ing this &s;at quite &s;ilent, though evi|dently wi&s;hing to talk; but the fol|lowing morning afforded her an op|portunity of di&s;playing both her cha|racter and abilities. Mr. Goldney being called out of the room on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, a poor woman &s;oon after came up to the window, with an infant in her arms, and every mark of &s;ickne&s;s and poverty on her coun|tenance. Mrs. Goldney, throwing up the &s;a&s;h, bade her begone, with a har&s;h voice; and, on her humble re|mon&s;trances and continued petitions, added, "&s;he mu&s;t apply to the pari&s;h for relief, as &s;he had nothing to give her;" and was then going to &s;hut the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
window, when our hero, gently pre|venting her, threw the poor wretch half a crown; who, invoking every ble&s;&s;ing on his head, retired with &s;ome precipitation, as Mrs. Goldney at the &s;ame moment was threatening to &s;end for the con&s;table, and have her committed as a vagrant.</P>
<P>When the woman was out of &s;ight, the lady re-&s;eated her&s;elf; and partly with a view of reproving Sir George's extravagance, and partly to exculpate her&s;elf from the imputation of un|charitablene&s;s, &s;he began every rela|tion of impo&s;itions that had ever happened to her&s;elf or her acquaint|ance in the cour&s;e of her life. The&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;he kept in her mind for &s;imilar oc|ca&s;ions, and never failed to produce them when required: and they con|&s;tantly &s;erved her for an excu&s;e; for never was &s;he known to be guilty of the crime of giving to common beg|gars&mdash;a vice that is preached and talked again&s;t much more than is nece&s;&s;ary; for, among the various me|thods by which fortunes are ruined and e&s;tates impaired in this fa&s;hion|able age, that of charity is not to be found. I would not have it from this declaration be &s;uppo&s;ed I mean to accu&s;e either the age or nation of a deficiency in this truly chri&s;tian virtue. On the contrary, when I recollect the infinite number of ho&s;|pitals,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
infirmaries, public &s;chools, and private charities, with which this kingdom abounds, I exult in the idea of being my&s;elf the native of a country, that in this re&s;pect exceeds almo&s;t all others; and, humbly re|lying on the hope that charity will cover a multitude of &s;ins, tru&s;t that we &s;hall be &s;upported and defended by a &s;uperior power from (as is expre&s;&s;ed in my motto)
<Q>The a&s;&s;ault of foreign or dome&s;tic crime.</Q></P>
<P>I only mean &s;imply to a&s;&s;ert, that, as charity was never yet known to hurt its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I know not why its ardour &s;hould ever be damped by
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the too cold and too rigid hand of &s;trict propriety, which would for|bid our ever be&s;towing on vagrants, le&s;t we &s;hould &s;ometimes be&s;tow un|worthily. But &s;ure this is not acting according to the precepts of our Divine Ma&s;ter, who, in telling us to "judge not, le&s;t we &s;hould be judged," certainly meant, that we &s;hould not limit our benevolence, or confine it to tho&s;e objects whom we deem alone to be worthy; &s;ince, as &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals our&s;elves, we can never know what calamities or temptations may have invaded the bo&s;oms, and de|&s;troyed the peace, of tho&s;e who &s;o|licit relief; and con&s;equently can
<PB N="9" REF="10">
never gue&s;s how far they may be de|&s;erving of it.</P>
<P>To return:&mdash;When Mrs. Goldney had wearied our hero with a long li&s;t of the impo&s;tors &s;he had met with, he replied: "But, my dear Madam, this poor creature mu&s;t be a real ob|ject of di&s;tre&s;s: &s;he had the palene&s;s of death on her countenance: that, &s;ure, could not be a&s;&s;umed."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir," an&s;wered the lady, "but it might. Do you not remem|ber, a few years &s;ince, the girl that was found, dying as &s;he pretended, on &s;ome common, I forget where; and the man who actually feigned him&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="11">
dead, to gain admittance at the Du|che&s;s of P&mdash;'s country &s;eat?"</P>
<P>She was proceeding to relate the other circum&s;tances of this really &s;trange affair, when Mr. Goldney re-entered the room, and a&s;ked Sir George if he would walk with him round his fields. He immediately a&s;&s;ented, glad to be relieved from the lady, who&s;e long and unintere&s;ting details had wearied him. Our hero hoped, during their little ramble, he &s;hould find &s;ome proof that Mr. Goldney's conduct was regulated by his principles, not his pa&s;&s;ions; flat|tering him&s;elf it was only the effect of unguarded warmth that had be|trayed
<PB N="11" REF="12">
him into an act of ab&s;olute cruelty: but he was di&s;appointed. His labourers, his &s;ervants, and even his tenants, were evidently in awe of him; and he perceived in his ad|dre&s;&s;es to them none of that &s;pirit of philanthropy of which he had boa&s;t|ed &s;o much. Hurt by this convic|tion, he returned to the hou&s;e, &s;e|cretly lamenting he had promi&s;ed to &s;tay till the following morning: but, not knowing what plea to make for an earlier departure unle&s;s he con|fe&s;&s;ed the truth (a mea&s;ure not to be taken without forfeiting every pretence to good manners as well as courte&s;y), he was obliged to be content; and, a neighbouring family joining them at
<PB N="12" REF="13">
tea, the afternoon went off better than he expected. At &s;upper the old and favourite topic was renewed, and the natural equality of man di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with even more than u&s;ual warmth; and again at a late hour they retired to their re&s;pective apartments.</P>
<P>The next morning, about &s;even o'clock, our hero was awakened by a violent uproar, which grew every moment &s;o much louder, that he ha&s;ted to dre&s;s him&s;elf, from a hope that he might have it in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the family, as he doubted not but they were in &s;ome great di&s;tre&s;s, though of what nature he was yet to learn: but, on attempting to go
<PB N="13" REF="14">
down &s;tairs, he found his chamber door locked on the out&s;ide. This &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed him, and he rang the bell: the noi&s;e &s;till continued, and for &s;ome time prevented his hearing a little &s;hrill voice through the door, crying, "What would you plea&s;e to want, Sir?" "I want the door opened for me to go down &s;tairs," returned our hero.</P>
<P>"I am very &s;orry, Sir," &s;aid the voice in a &s;till more tremulous ac|cent, "that I can't unlock it; but ma&s;ter has got the key."</P>
<P>"You can a&s;k him for it, I &s;up|po&s;e?" cried Sir George, almo&s;t an|grily:
<PB N="14" REF="15">
"How long mu&s;t I &s;tay here?"</P>
<P>"Only, Sir, till the con&s;tables are come; and they'll be here in a mi|nute."</P>
<P>"The con&s;tables!" exclaimed he: "For what purpo&s;e?"</P>
<P>The girl at the out&s;ide was now terrified; and a man running up the flairs, &s;he called him, and de&s;ired he would an&s;wer the gentleman; and then made her e&s;cape. Sir George now repeated the que&s;tion, and a&s;ked him for what purpo&s;e the con|&s;tables were &s;ent for, and what oc|ca&s;ioned the uproar? The man
<PB N="15" REF="16">
replied, "he did not know;" and, more frightened than the girl, fol|lowed her to the &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>The peace-officers now arrived; and the door of Sir George's cham|ber being unlocked, they charged him in the King's name as an ac|complice in the robbery committed that night on the property of Mr. Goldney.</P>
<P>Our hero, all a&s;toni&s;hment, re|quired an explanation, which after &s;ome time was granted; and he learned, that Mr. Goldney's butler, having broken open his ma&s;ter's bu|reau, and taken out a con&s;iderable
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;um, had made off with it, leaving a letter behind to excu&s;e his con|duct.</P>
<P>"And did that letter criminate me?" a&s;ked our hero, with that calm dignity which only con&s;cious inno|cence can give.</P>
<P>"No," replied the per&s;on from whom he had this information (who was a neighbour Mr. Goldney had called in on making the di&s;covery); "you are only taken up on &s;u&s;picion; and the grounds for your accu&s;ation are &s;o weak, there is no doubt but on examination you will be in&s;tantly acquitted."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">"I have &s;o little rea&s;on to fear," returned the Baronet, "that I yield without oppo&s;ition; though I mu&s;t &s;ay, Mr. Goldney's conduct is inex|cu&s;able, and totally unlike a gentle|man. May I &s;ee the letter you al|lude to?"</P>
<P>"Yes, certainly," &s;aid the man. He then gave him the letter, and he read as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the time you meet with the&s;e lines, you will have di&s;covered my making free with what you proba|bly call part of your property; but the conver&s;ations which pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;ter|day
<PB N="18" REF="19">
and the day before between you and the &s;trange gentleman have convinced me, that every man has an equal right to the goods this world can afford. Now it is but a very &s;mall &s;hare that I have taken to my|&s;elf: you had an abundance, I had a nece&s;&s;ity; and you cannot, there|fore, in con&s;cience, be angry with me for taking the fir&s;t opportunity of equalizing property (as you call it) as far as lay in my power; though I certainly begin before the &s;cheme is general, as you la&s;t night declared you hoped it would &s;oon be: and from this declaration I have rea&s;on to think you would rather applaud than condemn me. But not choo&s;ing
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to tru&s;t entirely to this, as I have too often &s;een gentlemen who &s;peak one thing when they mean another, I will take good care to avoid a pro|&s;ecution, by getting quite out of your reach. I have only to add my thanks to the &s;trange gentleman for putting this in my head, by &s;peaking of the propriety of a divi&s;ion of pro|perty; as to him I &s;hall probably be indebted for a comfortable mainte|nance, till the grand &s;cheme is put in execution, which will make me at once your brother as well as friend.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>DANIEL TURNER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The degree of clever a&s;&s;urance in
<PB N="20" REF="21">
this letter would have made our hero &s;mile, had he not felt too much a&s;hamed and di&s;concerted at the re|collection, that the liberty of &s;peech he had allowed him&s;elf was proba|bly the cau&s;e of this action, by which Mr. Goldney was a con&s;iderable &s;uf|ferer, and the poor wretch him&s;elf, in fact, would be more deeply &s;o; as it mu&s;t in future prevent him from all hone&s;t re&s;ources, and oblige him to continue in a way of life which too &s;urely would terminate in the gallows. But here a want of knowing the world was again his enemy, or he would have di&s;covered, from the &s;tyle of the letter, that Mr. Daniel Turner was an old offender;
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and that equalizing property was his excu&s;e, but had not been his mo|tive: and this di&s;covery might have con&s;oled him. As it was, he return|ed it to the per&s;on, and was going to a&s;k farther particulars when he was &s;ummoned to the parlour. His cheek glowed with hone&s;t indigna|tion on entering that room as a cri|minal, where he had been received as a gue&s;t and courted as a &s;upe|rior.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t fury of Mr. Goldney's pa&s;&s;ion being now abated, he be|haved with a con&s;trained civility, and apologized for the violent mea|&s;ures he was obliged to pur&s;ue; but
<PB N="22" REF="23">
added, "it was a duty he owed to him|&s;elf and to &s;ociety." Our hero made no reply but by an indignant glance; when Mrs. Goldney took up the &s;ubject, but &s;poke only in dark hints and ambiguous phra&s;es.</P>
<P>"For my part, I always &s;u&s;pect &s;trangers that come to one's hou&s;e for one knows not what. I think 'tis a mercy we were not all murdered in our beds; but this is only what one may very well expect."</P>
<P>Sir George could no longer remain &s;ilent. "Is this, Madam," &s;aid he, "a proof either of your philanthropy or your ju&s;tice? I came to your
<PB N="23" REF="24">
hou&s;e a &s;tranger, it is true; but I came not un&s;olicited by Mr. Gold|ney, who was as much unknown to me as I was to him. I was a &s;ingle man unarmed: what, therefore, could I have effected again&s;t your|&s;elves and your &s;ervants? Yet, be|cau&s;e one of the latter has committed an act of violence on your property, you infringe all the laws of ho&s;pita|lity by accu&s;ing me as his accom|plice."</P>
<P>"No, no," cried the lady; "we &s;hall take care not to infringe the laws, becau&s;e that might bring us into a &s;crape our&s;elves; you are only committed for examination before a
<PB N="24" REF="25">
ju&s;tice; and, if he acquits you, 'tis all very well."</P>
<P>"If he has any right to the name, he will acquit me," returned Sir George; "nor can I &s;ee any plea you have for detaining me: though, I would not now accept liberty till my character is publicly cleared."</P>
<P>"Not &s;ee any plea!" re&s;umed the lady: "did not the man in his let|ter &s;ay you per&s;uaded him to rob us?"</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t Heaven!" exclaimed Sir George, "I per&s;uaded him!"</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">"Well well, you put it into his head&mdash;that's all one&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e."</P>
<P>"The law will determine that," &s;aid our hero coldly; "but pray how much longer am I to wait your lei|&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"When I have done breakfa&s;t, we &s;hall &s;et out," &s;aid Mr. Goldney.</P>
<P>Our hero made no reply; and they all continued &s;ilent, till the former ordered the carriage. His lady then entreated he would not go in the chai&s;e with the villain, le&s;t he &s;hould do him a mi&s;chief. At this the Ba|ronet was very near lo&s;ing the calm|ne&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="27">
he had hitherto maintained; but, checking his ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, he re|plied contemptuou&s;ly, "I fear, Ma|dam, your apprehen&s;ions may di&s;or|der you; but pray be &s;atisfied, I have no <HI>farther</HI> ill intentions."</P>
<P>Mr. Goldney then &s;aid, he meant to walk him&s;elf; and &s;et out directly, leaving our hero to follow in the car|riage with his two attendants.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Cameron the ju&s;tice having been previou&s;ly informed that a rob|ber was coming before him to be ex|amined, and the &s;tory gaining &s;ome addition from every per&s;on who re|lated it, it was at la&s;t currently re|ported that a highwayman was ap|prehended, who had &s;topped two gentlemen's carriages and a &s;tage coach: and this intelligence draw|ing together all ranks of people, Mr. Cameron's hall was filled before the criminal and his accu&s;ers arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">What various emotions aro&s;e in the heart of our hero, when, amid&s;t the &s;tupid gaze of an unfeeling po|pulace, he was led in, followed by Mr. Goldney! The attorney to whom he had given the five guineas for the u&s;e of the poor family hap|pening to be pre&s;ent, on &s;eeing him, exclaimed: "Is that the gentleman accu&s;ed as a highwayman? He is an angel rather: he is no more a high|wayman than I am!"</P>
<P>"If you had &s;aid a rogue," re|plied a pert young &s;park with a loud laugh, "perhaps you might have been right, and the gentleman's character not vindicated neither; for
<PB N="29" REF="30">
it is &s;aid that lawyer and thief are &s;ynonymous terms."</P>
<P>"As the law is a profe&s;&s;ion," an|&s;wered another gentleman, "where perhaps (according to the ideas how|ever of worldly-minded men) it is ea&s;ier and more profitable to cheat than to maintain a perfect integrity, it is the more honour to tho&s;e who maintain in it a firm uprightne&s;s of character which nothing can &s;hake; and then not even the intended &s;ar|ca&s;ms of the wittie&s;t or the &s;illie&s;t of men can fully it even for a mo|ment."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">The young man, aba&s;hed at this reproof, &s;at down and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Mr. Cameron now a&s;ked Mr. Goldney what he had to accu&s;e the pri&s;oner of; and he replied in the following manner:</P>
<P>"That gentleman, as he appears to be, I met two days &s;ince in the coffee-room at the King's Arms. His &s;entiments plea&s;ed me, becau&s;e they accorded with my own; and I learnt from his conver&s;ation that his name was Warrington, and that he was going up to London with a view of joining &s;ome of the republi|can
<PB N="31" REF="32">
parties there; and from thence intended to &s;et out for France, to be an eye-witne&s;s of the glorious Revo|lution, and to form a friend&s;hip with &s;ome of the heads of the nation. I invited him to &s;pend the two or three following days with me; and, he con|&s;enting, we &s;et out together. I had no rea&s;on, during his &s;tay with me, to &s;u&s;pect him of being any thing but what he appeared, till this morn|ing, when, ri&s;ing earlier than u&s;ual, I went into my &s;tudy, and there found my bureau broke open, and above two hundred pounds taken out in ca&s;h and notes. On the fir&s;t alarm, I called in a neighbour who happen|ed to pa&s;s by; and then &s;ummoning
<PB N="32" REF="33">
my family, di&s;covered the butler was ab&s;ent, and &s;oon learnt he had not been &s;een &s;ince la&s;t night. My wife &s;aid, it was well if the &s;tranger had no hand in it, and that I had better &s;ecure him. I followed her advice, and, &s;tealing &s;oftly up &s;tairs, locked his chamber door on the out&s;ide. Whil&s;t I was gone, Mr. Parker &s;aw a letter addre&s;&s;ed to me lying on the floor, which, in my confu&s;ion, I had overlooked; and, on reading it, I thought I had acted very properly in preventing Mr. Warrington's e&s;|cape, as it contains an accu&s;ation of him; and I in&s;tantly determined to bring him before you."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">"Very well, Sir," &s;aid the ju&s;tice, "you acted in this re&s;pect much more prudently than your gue&s;t, who, if really an acce&s;&s;ary in your butler's guilt, was mo&s;t extremely unwi&s;e in going to bed again in your hou&s;e, and not flying with his a&s;&s;o|ciate. What have you, Sir (turn|ing to our hero), to &s;ay in your de|fence? and how, after committing &s;uch a crime, could you fall a&s;leep, when you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible a di&s;co|very would take place in the morn|ing?"</P>
<P>He &s;poke in a tone of ironical plea&s;antry that convinced Sir George he &s;aw things in a right point of
<PB N="34" REF="35">
view; and he immediately replied, "I &s;lept, Sir, becau&s;e, as I perceive you have already found out, I was ignorant of the whole affair; but I beg you will read the letter alluded to, as I tru&s;t that will &s;till farther clear me in your opinion."</P>
<P>Mr. Cameron now de&s;ired to &s;ee the letter; and, when he had fini&s;hed it, bur&s;t into a hearty laugh, ex|claiming, "I thought it would prove &s;o." Then &s;uddenly a&s;&s;uming a graver a&s;pect, he addre&s;&s;ed our hero:</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, Sir, to di&s;appoint you by declaring you are not &s;till far|ther cleared in my opinion, as you
<PB N="35" REF="36">
hoped to be; for, from the fir&s;t moment Mr. Goldney had given his rea&s;ons for accu&s;ing you, I thought them &s;o weak, that I was immedi|ately convinced of your innocence of the crime laid to your charge. This letter proves it more fully, as it does not imply you either &s;ugge&s;ted, or per&s;uaded the butler to commit an action for which he is amenable to the laws of his country; though he plainly &s;ays, you put it into his head, by &s;peaking in terms which an ignorant mind or a ba&s;e heart may ea&s;ily wre&s;t to their own pur|po&s;es. Thus far you are guilty, though perhaps unintentionally &s;o; and I flatter my&s;elf it will be a caution

to you in future not to make public, &s;entiments that can do you no honour, can be of no &s;ervice to your hearers, and may, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, be of e&s;&s;ential di&s;&s;ervice, not merely to individuals, but to the world in ge|neral. And now, Sir, you are at li|berty."</P>
<P>Sir George bowed, and thanked him for his candour and liberality; at the &s;ame time declaring he would be very cautious in future of what he &s;aid, though he tru&s;ted his prin|ciples were &s;uch as he might avow without a blu&s;h; &s;ince he could &s;o|lemnly aver, he had no wi&s;h but for the general happine&s;s of mankind,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
which he had lately been taught was only to be effected by a general equa|lity.</P>
<P>"You have not properly con&s;ider|ed this matter, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Ca|meron; "when you have, you will be convinced that the liberty which in all re&s;pects Engli&s;hmen at pre&s;ent enjoy, under our excellent King and glorious Con&s;titution, gives us as much happine&s;s as we have any right to expect, unle&s;s we were more per|fect our&s;elves."</P>
<P>He now addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Goldney, who was much confounded at this unexpected termination of the affair,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
as it proved both his folly and vio|lence, and begged to know from whence he had taken the &s;ervant who had robbed him, and how long he had been in his &s;ervice; adding, as a rea&s;on for the enquiry, that he imagined, from the &s;tyle of the letter, it was not the fir&s;t offence of the kind he had committed.</P>
<P>Mr. Goldney replied, that "the la&s;t place he lived in was Sir John Harborough's, with whom, as Mr. Cameron knew, he had long been at variance: therefore he would not ap|ply to him for a character, but took him without any;" and added, "he had only been with him five weeks."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">"Then, Sir," returned the ju&s;tice, "I can give you &s;ome information: about that time Sir John Harborough told me he had parted with a man up|on a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of di&s;hone&s;ty, but without &s;uch proof as could afford a rea&s;on for committing him. Had you not &s;uffered an ill-founded re|&s;entment to prevent your making proper enquiries, you would at this time have been two hundred pounds in pocket."</P>
<P>The crowd who had a&s;&s;embled now began to di&s;per&s;e; when a gen|tleman making his way into the room, on &s;eeing our hero, &s;tarted with &s;ur|pri&s;e, and exclaimed: "Zounds, Sir
<PB N="40" REF="41">
George! is it you who have been taken up? What, you have been tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon &s;omebody's manor, I &s;uppo&s;e? But if &s;o, I'll clear you, for I can &s;wear to your qualification." Then ha&s;tily &s;haking him by the hand, he acco&s;ted the ju&s;tice: "Sir, this gentleman is as hone&s;t a man as any in all the county of Northumberland. His name is Sir George Warrington, and he is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a clear e&s;tate of &s;ix thou&s;and a year; and any thing farther you may require as to his character, I will an&s;wer to your &s;atisfaction and his own."</P>
<P>Mr. Cameron bowed, and an&s;wer|ed, "he was now more proud of his
<PB N="41" REF="42">
own di&s;cernment, as, from the in&s;tant he beheld him, he believed him per|fectly innocent, and on examination found he was right."</P>
<P>This gentleman, who&s;e name was Warbourne, was a neighbour of our hero, who, coming to K &mdash; on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, accidentally pa&s;&s;ed by the ju&s;tice's door, and, &s;eeing an un|u&s;ual crowd a&s;&s;embled, inquired what it meant. A beggar-woman, with an infant in her arms, was the fir&s;t to reply: "that it was a per&s;on com|mitted for a robbery, but &s;he was &s;ure he could not be guilty, for the day before he had &s;aved her and her infant from &s;tarving, and that &s;he
<PB N="42" REF="43">
prayed he might be cleared from all &s;u&s;picion." Mr. Warbourne though a rough was a generous character, and, throwing the woman a &s;hilling, entered the hou&s;e from a motive of curio&s;ity; and when he &s;aw in the pri&s;oner his neighbour and friend Sir George Warrington, he could not conceal his &s;urpri&s;e, but addre&s;&s;ed him in the manner that has been al|ready mentioned. When the whole affair was related to him by our hero, who felt no little plea&s;ure at &s;eeing a man of his re&s;pon&s;ibility, who was known to mo&s;t of the company a&s;|&s;embled, vouch for his reputation, Mr. Warbourne indulged him&s;elf in a hearty laugh, and, going up to Mr.
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Goldney, a&s;ked him how he could po&s;&s;ibly take Sir George for a thief? That gentleman was already &s;uffi|ciently mortified at the recollection of his own conduct; and, the addre&s;s of Mr. Warbourne adding to the irri|tation he already felt, he replied &s;o warmly, that Mr. Cameron, fearful of the con&s;equences, contrived to draw their attention to the attorney, who was happy in an opportunity of thanking Sir George for his libera|lity to the poor family, which he &s;aid had &s;aved them from ruin. Mr. Cameron then added, that what Mr. Mitford had told him of this liberality had previou&s;ly given him an idea that
<PB N="44" REF="45">
Mr. Goldney's accu&s;ation was ill-founded as well as ill-judged. He then reque&s;ted that the&s;e gentlemen would favour him with their com|pany at dinner, and, our hero con|&s;enting, Mr. Warbourne would not refu&s;e; and Mr. Mitford gladly join|ed them, as he already felt &s;o &s;trong a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of Sir George, that he wi&s;hed to cultivate his acquaintance; nor was the latter le&s;s inclined to return his regard.</P>
<P>As our hero left the room, he was followed by the acclamations of the multitude, and the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor beggar-woman, who, on Mr.

Warbourne's relating the &s;hare &s;he had in his entering the ju&s;tice's hall, experienced his bounty in a &s;till higher degree.</P>

<P>WHEN they reached the King's Arms, our hero, who had yet ta&s;ted nothing that day, ordered &s;ome cof|fee, over which he and his friend en|tered into conver&s;ation, and mutually enquired of each other by what ac|cident they met at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their re&s;pective homes. Mr. Warbourne fir&s;t replied, "that he was on a vi&s;it to a gentleman who lived near St. Albans, but that &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s had brought him to K&mdash; the preceding day, that would be
<PB N="47" REF="48">
&s;ettled in the evening, and the next morning he meant to return."</P>
<P>Sir George next recounted his ad|ventures, and the motives by which he had been induced to quit War|rington Ca&s;tle, and the plan he had formed in con&s;equence of his newly-entertained principles. Mr. War|bourne &s;tarted at this confe&s;&s;ion. He was a man of &s;ound judgment and good &s;en&s;e, though unpoli&s;hed man|ners: he in&s;tantly &s;aw the precipice on which his young friend &s;tood, and &s;ought to lead him gently from it, not by contradiction but per&s;ua&s;ion, as he well under&s;tood his character, and was aware he would, in his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="48" REF="49">
humour, fire at the lea&s;t oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid he, "and you re|tain your intentions, in &s;pite of all you have met with to damp your ar|dour?"</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand you," re|plied Sir George.</P>
<P>"Why," an&s;wered the other, "I mean the unplea&s;ant &s;ituation you have ju&s;t been relea&s;ed from, and which you certainly were drawn into by &s;o public an avowal of your prin|ciples; and the elopement of Mr. Benjamin Potter and Mi&s;s Thornton;
<PB N="49" REF="50">
an event undoubtedly the con&s;equence of the&s;e new-fangled notions of equa|lity, as the man him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed. I &s;hould think the&s;e would convince you that the old way is the be&s;t, &s;ince you have had no proof of the contrary. But however, we will talk this over &s;ome other time; and now &s;uppo&s;e you were to go back with me to Mr. Digby's, and &s;tay a few days; you will find him a plea&s;ant man, and the family particularly agreeable, and, as my friend, I will in&s;ure you a wel|come reception."</P>
<P>"I thank you," returned our hero; "I &s;hould be happy to pay my re|&s;pects to any one you value; but at pre&s;ent I am engaged. But let me
<PB N="50" REF="51">
&s;peak a moment in defence of my own principles. You con&s;ider every event I have met with in my journey as the con&s;equence of mi&s;taken ideas, either in my&s;elf or others; but you forget that perfection is not to be ex|pected from any thing; that in the infancy even of the Roman republic, it was &s;upported by &s;tratagem and vio|lence; and becau&s;e a few men have availed them&s;elves of the general prin|ciples of the nation, to commit ac|tions &s;ugge&s;ted only by their own ba&s;e hearts, you unju&s;tly condemn a whole party. Con&s;ider al&s;o, my dear Sir, as our great poet expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>All di&s;cord' is 'harmony not under&s;tood,</L>
<L>All partial evil, univer&s;al good.'</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">"Ay ay," replied Mr. Warbourne laughing, "I dare &s;ay it is &s;o; for I am certain the di&s;cord in France is harmony that Engli&s;hmen cannot under&s;tand; and I hope their emi&s;|&s;aries will not endeavour to teach us." He now &s;aw the folly of con|tending with a young man who was glowing with the ardour of liberty, and gave up the point; though not without an earne&s;t hope that &s;ome event, more &s;triking than any he had yet experienced, would at length cure his infatuation, and give him a proper idea of the &s;entiments he had imbibed. The conver&s;ation then took a more general turn, till it was time for them to adjourn to Mr. Cameron's; where,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
in addition to the party, they found a Mr. Wilmot, of whom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak more fully.</P>
<P>He was a man of a mild and timid character, and re&s;erved manners, but of inflexible ob&s;tinacy. Having lived many years without forming any po|litical opinion, and &s;pending the greate&s;t part of his time in the coun|try, he was thought a very proper object to work upon by a Mr. Da|venport, who occa&s;ionally re&s;ided in his neighbourhood, and who was him&s;elf crafty to a degree &s;carcely credible. Having nothing to lo&s;e, and depending &s;olely on his patrons for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he of cour&s;e follow|ed
<PB N="53" REF="54">
them in their adherence to the party formed in favour of the French Revolution, and was by them deputed to gain as many votaries as po&s;&s;ible to their &s;ide. He therefore attacked Mr. Wilmot, who ea&s;ily yielded to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; but that once fixed on his mind, nothing was able to era&s;e it, and he became a firm though not a violent republican; and in every other part of his cha|racter was a very amiable man and u&s;eful member of &s;ociety. As he &s;at during dinner next to Sir George, their &s;entiments were &s;oon made known to each other, and they be|came mutually plea&s;ed. Mr. Ca|meron, Mr. Mitford, and Mr. War|bourne,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
were evidently on the other &s;ide; but, finding their arguments availed not, and fearing a quarrel might en&s;ue, they turned the con|ver&s;ation to the occurrences of the morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilmot's curio&s;ity was ex|cited and &s;oon gratified by our hero, who related, with much humour, all that had happened to him in con&s;e|quence of his accepting Mr. Gold|ney's invitation. Mr. Wilmot re|plied, "It was very unfortunate for him, that Sir George had been &s;o ill-u&s;ed by a new acquaintance, as he feared it would deter him from ac|cepting his offered friend&s;hip." Our
<PB N="55" REF="56">
hero an&s;wered, "By no means: that meeting Mr. Wilmot in &s;uch a circle was a &s;ufficient introduction; and in future he meant to avoid all appear|ance of my&s;tery him&s;elf, by openly acknowledging his title as well as name; &s;ince his accidentally meeting Mr. Warbourne convinced him it was a vain hope to conceal him&s;elf, although he &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t to relinqui&s;h voluntarily a di&s;tinction which was merely a nominal one." Mr. Wilmot applauded his re&s;olu|tion, and then a&s;ked if he would ac|company him to his hou&s;e, to afford him an opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance from which he hoped to derive &s;o much plea&s;ure. After
<PB N="56" REF="57">
&s;ome he&s;itation our hero a&s;&s;ented, and promi&s;ed to attend him the next day. Mr. Warbourne, in an accent of re|proach, reminded him that he had re|fu&s;ed him a &s;imilar reque&s;t; but Sir George, though with &s;ome confu&s;ion, excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying, "his vi&s;it to Mr. Wilmot would, he hoped, facilitate a plan he had &s;o much at heart, and therefore tru&s;ted his friend would pardon his apparent incivili|ty." Mr. Warbourne only an&s;wered by &s;haking his head; and the gentle|men &s;oon after parted, as the latter had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Mitford in which the Ju&s;tice was al&s;o con|cerned; and Mr. Wilmot returned to the family he was with.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">Our hero was of cour&s;e obliged to retire to his inn, which he did with a heart exhilarated by the latter occur|rences of the day, as he exulted in having at length found a character &s;imilar to his own, from whom he might expect advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and from whom he could fear no danger. He knew not whether mo&s;t to pity or de&s;pi&s;e Mr. Goldney for the extreme folly and impropriety of his conduct, and rejoiced that his new friend Mr. Wilmot had re&s;cued from unde&s;erved opprobrium the principles by which he was actuated; &s;ince it proved, in &s;pite of Mr. War|bourne's hint, that it was not owing to them Mr. Thornton had been &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="59">
unfortunate, or Mr. Goldney &s;o vio|lent, but from evident faults in their hearts or heads; and this con&s;idera|tion wholly reconciled him to his late formed plan, re&s;pecting which he had begun to waver in the morning: but now in his brea&s;t,
<Q><L>Fear, di&s;content, &s;olicitude, give place,</L>

<P>WHILST our hero waited for his &s;upper, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf by walking up and down the room, and looking at the prints by which it was adorned; when a folded paper caught his eye, lying under one of the chairs. He took it up; and, ob&s;erving it had no addre&s;s, opened it, and read as follows:</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to his per&s;on, he was a thin and &s;pare man; which was the more extraordinary, as he loved
<PB N="60" REF="61">
good eating, and had a remarkable appetite. I ought, however, to add, he was not nice in his diet, as a &s;houl|der of mutton with onion &s;auce was his peculiar favourite; as he prefer|red it to a haunch of veni&s;on: yet I have been told he would &s;ometimes quit that for a boiled pig's face, which, I once heard him &s;ay, was, with greens, the greate&s;t of all dain|ties&mdash; a &s;houlder of mutton only ex|cepted. He had the neate&s;t hand at &s;licing a cucumber I ever met with, and was fond of the employment&mdash; which was the more di&s;intere&s;ted, as he never touched it him&s;elf; and on the&s;e occa&s;ions u&s;ed to &s;ay with a hearty laugh, he would as &s;oon eat
<PB N="61" REF="62">
&s;o much ice with pepper and vi|negar.</P>
<P>"He did not love riding on hor&s;e|back, but would walk, when his bu|&s;ine&s;s permitted it, &s;everal miles a day; and, what was extremely odd, he always cho&s;e the turnpike road, whether winter or &s;ummer, preferring either du&s;t or mire to green fields and &s;hady lanes. When his &s;on was old enough to accompany him in the&s;e rambles, they generally parted at the end of the town, the lad cro&s;&s;ing a &s;tile into the meadows, where he in|dulged the fir&s;t efforts of a genius &s;ince &s;o con&s;picuous to the whole world. Here the beauties of nature
<PB N="62" REF="63">
fir&s;t engaged his attention; the &s;ong of the linnet, the verdure of the gra&s;s, and the variety of wild flowers he occa&s;ionally met with, were by turns the &s;ubject of his early mu&s;e. I have &s;till by me &s;ome of the&s;e juvenile compo&s;itions, which would not di&s;|grace his latter productions; but a natural fear of his father, who was of a &s;tern inflexible character, prevented him from &s;hewing the&s;e effu&s;ions of fancy at home: but to me he con|&s;tantly communicated them; and be|ing a few years his &s;enior, he readily relied upon my &s;uperior judgment, which was always proved by my ap|probation. This formed a perfect intimacy between us; and I believe I
<PB N="63" REF="64">
may &s;ay without vanity, it is owing to my encouragement that the world has been &s;ince favoured with the works of this wonderful genius. His mother was a woman of no very marked cha|racter, but good-humoured to a de|gree, and as proud of her darling boy; though &s;he was no great reader indeed, for, excepting a &s;ermon on a Sunday, &s;he never read any thing but news-papers and magazines: but &s;he wrote a very decent hand, under|&s;tood accounts particularly well, and excelled with her needle. To &s;um up her talents in one word, &s;he was a notable wife and a kind mother.</P>
<P>"The following anecdote. I had
<PB N="64" REF="65">
from her own mouth, which &s;uffi|ciently proves the exqui&s;ite di&s;cern|ment of him who&s;e life I am about to relate. One evening after a walk in the fields, he came home and wrote down an ode he had ju&s;t com|po&s;ed on a bramble&mdash;a barren &s;ubject it is true, but what is there a great genius cannot effect? He then gave it to his mother to read aloud ju&s;t before &s;upper: and whether he did not point it properly, or that &s;he did not very well under&s;tand her &s;tops, I cannot take upon me to decide: however it was, &s;he made ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e of one ver&s;e; which &s;o en|raged the young Apollo, that, in the agony of literary mortification, he
<PB N="65" REF="66">
da&s;hed his hand on the table; broke two plates, the &s;plinters of which fell into a di&s;h of minced veal and a half apple pye that the &s;ervant had placed on the table; and cut the fourth fin|ger of his right hand in &s;uch a man|ner, that perhaps many who only knew him in the latter part of his life may have &s;een the &s;car, which he always con&s;idered as a mark of li|terary glory, and contemplated with that plea&s;ure a hero experiences when he views the mark of a bullet gained in the fields of victory.</P>
<P>"To return: His mother was much &s;hocked at the lo&s;s of her &s;upper and the de&s;truction of her plates; but his
<PB N="66" REF="67">
father, who now for the fir&s;t time felt the warm glow of paternal ten|derne&s;s that reflected from the bright lu&s;tre of his &s;on's expanding genius, caught him to his brea&s;t, and ex|claimed, 'Oh my noble boy!'</P>
<P>"There are &s;ome ill-natured people to whom I have related this circum|&s;tance, who do not &s;cruple to aver, the father's approbation was in mere contradiction to his wife, becau&s;e &s;he was angry: but if &s;o, which nobody can a&s;certain, he had &s;ome rea&s;on for it, as I have heard it hinted: he wi&s;h|ed that evening for a hot pork &s;teak for his &s;upper, but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that the cold veal &s;hould be minced, as it
<PB N="67" REF="68">
would not keep till the next day. To be &s;ure, in this re&s;pect &s;he &s;hewed her prudence, as their income was li|mited, and required much oeco|nomy: but my own decided opinion is, that the father's tran&s;port was wholly unconnected with this cir|cum&s;tance, and aro&s;e merely from &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure at this fir&s;t proof he had received of the talents of his &s;on."</P>
<P>Here the paper ended; and our hero, though wholly at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s the purport, was much amu&s;ed by its contents; but, unable to form any opinion of its intention, he folded and laid it on the table. The waiter, now
<PB N="68" REF="69">
entering with his &s;upper, told him a gentleman who had been in that room the preceding day begged to be admitted for a few moments, to look for a paper of con&s;equence he had lo&s;t. Sir George, con&s;idering that he had peru&s;ed as of no po&s;&s;i|ble con&s;equence, feared his &s;earch would be fruitle&s;s, but de&s;ired he would walk in; and on his entrance, taking it from the table, enquired with his u&s;ual courte&s;y if that was what he meant. The &s;tranger acknow|ledged it immediately, and, giving him a profu&s;ion of thanks, prepared &s;lowly to quit the room; at the &s;ame time ca&s;ting many an enamoured glance at the roa&s;t fowl and egg &s;auce
<PB N="69" REF="70">
which were &s;moking on the board. He was rather a meagre than a thin looking man; and our hero, fancying he appeared hungry, addre&s;&s;ed him with infinite benevolence. "Per|haps, Sir, you will do me the hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of partaking my little repa&s;t, which, as I am now alone, will be otherwi&s;e an un&s;ocial meal? I &s;hall be really glad of your company."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger waited not to be a&s;ked twice; but, advancing with a low bow, laid down his hat, and took a place at the table. Very little conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed during &s;upper; the gentleman was otherwi&s;e employ|ed; and Sir George, ob&s;erving he ate
<PB N="70" REF="71">
as if he had &s;een no meat for many days, &s;aid with a &s;mile, "one fowl was not enough for two people," (though he had him&s;elf only taken a wing) and ordered the waiter to bring up &s;ome veal cutlets or a beef &s;teak, a&s;king the &s;tranger which he prefer|red; and he replying, a beef &s;teak if agreeable to Sir George, the man left the room, and &s;oon returned with it. This la&s;ted very little longer than the fowl; and our hero thought, if he had not obtained an agreeable compa|nion, he had certainly done an act of charity, as it was evident his gue&s;t was extremely hungry. When the table was cleared, which was not till the di&s;hes were emptied, and the wine
<PB N="71" REF="72">
&s;et on it, he told our hero he had conferred an unreturnable obligation on hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Sir George with much &s;ur|pri&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nquired in what way. Had he &s;poken the whole truth, he would have acknowledged the &s;upper as well as the re&s;toring him his lo&s;t pa|per; but, though at that moment he probably felt the former more &s;en|&s;ibly, he only mentioned the latter; adding that Sir George had behaved with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity, as, had it fallen into any other per|&s;on's hands, they might have u&s;ed it to his di&s;grace and their own advan|tage.</P>
<P>Sir George with difficulty con|cealed
<PB N="72" REF="73">
a &s;mile at this &s;peech, not conceiving of what u&s;e it could po&s;|&s;ibly be to any one; but politely re|plied, "As it could be of no &s;ervice to him, there was little merit in re|&s;toring it to the owner, to whom it might be of con&s;equence: but pray, Sir," added he, "may I take the li|berty of reque&s;ting to know what it means?"</P>
<P>The other, drawing his chair to the fire, and taking up the bumper which was placed before him, an&s;wered in a half whi&s;per: "Why, Sir, I'll tell you as a great &s;ecret; but fir&s;t &s;uffer me to a&s;k if you have copied it."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">"Oh no indeed," cried our hero, laughing at the very idea.</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir&mdash;I thought you were a man of too much honour; now you &s;hall know all. In the younger part of my life, I was very intimate with a lad who is now a great man as well as a great genius: but he has forgot|ten me, Sir, entirely, though, as I &s;aid in this paper, I was the fir&s;t per&s;on who even thought of encouraging his talents: but ingratitude, Sir, is the vice of the age; and I cannot expect to avoid the evils which fall indi&s;cri|minately on all mankind: and &s;o, Sir, as I am not very rich, indeed (for I may as well tell the truth) I have

<P><PB N="75" REF="76">"In ill health, then?"</P>
<P>"By no means: he is as hearty as I am."</P>
<P>"How then," rejoined Sir George, &s;carcely able to pre&s;erve his gravity, "are you &s;ure you &s;hall have an op|portunity of publi&s;hing it?"</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir, of that I mu&s;t take my chance; but, if not, I &s;hall leave it to my heirs. It will be a jointure for my wife, an e&s;tate to my elde&s;t &s;on, it will portion out my girls, and ap|prentice my younger boys."</P>
<P>"You have great dependance on
<PB N="76" REF="77">
it," cried Sir George; "but for what purpo&s;e have you introduced this gen|tleman's father and mother?"</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, do you not know that when a man of genius has left this world, all tho&s;e who remain in it are anxious not only to be acquainted with what he has done him&s;elf, but to hear of his father, his grandfather, and his great grandfather: and if one hi&s;|torian gives an epitome of their lives, another will take up the pen and re|late it in full: and if fifty authors were to write the &s;ame life, they would all be read, becau&s;e every per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;ed to relate different anecdotes; and it was for this rea&s;on, Sir, I was
<PB N="77" REF="78">
&s;o apprehen&s;ive le&s;t that invaluable and original anecdote of the broken plates &s;hould fall into the hands of any other author; but I pre&s;ume, Sir, you do not write, by your ap|pearance?"</P>
<P>"No, really I do not," replied Sir George &s;miling: "But pray tell me, for I am quite unacquainted with the&s;e &s;ort of things, if this is the be|ginning of your work."</P>
<P>"No, Sir, it is the fifth chapter: if you plea&s;e, I will to-morrow wait on you with the other four, and per|haps you may not object to honour|ing
<PB N="78" REF="79">
me with your name as a &s;ub|&s;criber."</P>
<P>Sir George had not the lea&s;t wi&s;h to accept this kind offer, yet he would not refu&s;e the reque&s;t; and replied: "I leave this place early in the morn|ing; therefore &s;hall not at pre&s;ent have time to attend to it; but, that I may in future profit by a work of equal utility and erudition, I &s;hall be glad if you will &s;et down my name. Pray what is the &s;ub&s;cription?"</P>
<P>The author with &s;ome he&s;itation an&s;wered: "I do not exactly know till the book is fini&s;hed, but I think it cannot be le&s;s than a guinea."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">Our hero, whil&s;t untying his pur&s;e, ob&s;erved, "it mu&s;t take &s;ome time to write a book of that &s;ize and con|&s;equence."</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir," returned the other, "I mean to have it all ready to &s;end to the pre&s;s, the moment it is in my power; for, were I to delay it, I doubt not but half a dozen garret writers would fore&s;tall me."</P>
<P>"That would be a pity indeed," cried Sir George, giving him a cou|ple of guineas, and de&s;iring he would put him down for two &s;ets.</P>
<P>The author in the humble&s;t man|ner
<PB N="80" REF="81">
returned the mo&s;t unbounded thanks for this goodne&s;s; and, on hearing his name, exclaimed as in a tran&s;port of joy, "Sir George War|rington! Oh, good Sir, that name will &s;ecure my book a favourable reception from the world, and an honourable li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers: for who that &s;ees Sir George Warrington at the head of it&mdash;the patron of the arts and &s;ciences, the defender of injured merit, the &s;upport of litera|ture&mdash;will refu&s;e to add his own?"</P>
<P>This flattery was by far too gro&s;s for our hero. Con&s;cious how little he de&s;erved it, it appeared almo&s;t like a reproof; and, looking &s;ternly at the
<PB N="81" REF="82">
affrighted author, he replied, "No more of this, Sir, if you plea&s;e; I dete&s;t flattery at all times; but now, when I am convinced you never heard the name of Warrington till this moment, it di&s;gu&s;ts as well as di&s;plea&s;es me."</P>
<P>The man looked terrified at this unexpected check; and &s;tammering out &s;ome apology for having mi&s;|taken him, Sir George felt his na|tural good humour return with his pity, and, fearing he had been too rough, again addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P>"As it may yet be &s;ome years be|fore you can po&s;&s;ibly publi&s;h the
<PB N="82" REF="83">
book in que&s;tion, why do you not try your genius in &s;ome other way in the mean time?"</P>
<P>"Why yes, Sir, &s;o I intend: I have now a volume of e&s;&s;ays at the book-&s;eller's; but he does not give me much encouragement. Few people, Sir, read e&s;&s;ays, I am afraid."</P>
<P>"Well then, novels I am told are in high repute."</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, very high indeed; but, Sir, the trade is over&s;tocked; there are now as many novel writers as novel readers; old ladies, young la|dies, every body indeed, gentle and
<PB N="83" REF="84">
&s;imple, as people &s;ay, write novels now. I wi&s;h Parliament would take it into con&s;ideration, and forbid the rich from engaging in it to the de|&s;truction of the poor."</P>
<P>"Why, &s;urely you would not check the efforts of genius," return|ed Sir George, "be it in what line of life it may? No: rather let us &s;top the pens of tho&s;e who wa&s;te their own time in writing, and their fel|low creatures' in reading, their mi&s;e|rable productions, or tho&s;e who, by painting vice and folly in their mo&s;t gaudy colours, allure the innocent and &s;educe the unwary."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">"Why yes, Sir, you are quite right, to be &s;ure," cried the author; "I wi&s;h with all my heart it was &s;o." And now having fini&s;hed his bottle, and fearing a more minute critici&s;m on the part of our hero, he ro&s;e up, and, repeating his thanks for all fa|vours, took leave with a low bow.</P>
<P>Sir George had been much di|verted by the conver&s;ation of his new acquaintance, who had given him an in&s;ight into things unknown before, as this was the fir&s;t time he had ever been in company with an author. He remained for &s;ome time meditat|ing on what had pa&s;&s;ed, yet &s;till at a lo&s;s to comprehend of what u&s;e it
<PB N="85" REF="86">
could be to the world, to know that the father of any great genius pre|ferred roa&s;t &s;houlder of mutton and pig's face to a haunch of veni&s;on. Not in the lea&s;t able to reconcile this with his ideas of real knowledge, he retired to re&s;t, re&s;olving to perplex him&s;elf no farther with a problem apparently more difficult to &s;olve than any one in Euclid.</P>

<P>ON ri&s;ing the next morning, he recollected it was Sunday; and, having always made it a point never to travel on that day, determined not to &s;ully his fir&s;t entrance into life by violat|ing an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle; but re&s;olved to &s;end an excu&s;e to Mr. Wil|mot, and promi&s;e to follow him the &s;ucceeding day. But this trouble he was &s;aved by the entrance of a waiter, who brought an apology from that gentle|man for not attending him immedi|ately, but that he was unexpectedly
<PB N="87" REF="88">
detained till the next morning, when he &s;hould be happy to accompany him to Violet Hill, the name of his place. Our hero, perfectly well &s;a|tisfied with his new arrangement, &s;ent an an&s;wer expre&s;&s;ing that it would be &s;till more agreeable to him; and then, having taken his breakfa&s;t, &s;et out for church.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have lived in a coun|try town know very well, that a hand&s;ome and elegant young &s;tranger is the object of univer&s;al attention; and various were the conjectures his appearance in this place gave ri&s;e to: but, when he was &s;een there again in the afternoon by two or three old la|dies,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
it was a received opinion he went for no good; and, in &s;ome of their Sunday evening a&s;&s;emblies, it was debated what could induce him to go to church, at a time when only the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, and a few &s;uperannuated beings like them|&s;elves, ever frequented it.&mdash;"I never knew a young man of fa&s;hion," cries one, "go to church only to &s;ay his pray|ers." "No no," rejoined another, "depend upon it, there was &s;ome bet|ter rea&s;on; he went to look at &s;ome pretty girl he had &s;een in the morn|ing; a lady's maid or a trade&s;man's daughter." "I believe you are right," exclaimed a third; "for, now I think on't, he &s;at in a pew very
<PB N="89" REF="90">
near Tim Jenkins the &s;hoemaker's; and I am pretty &s;ure Sukey Jenkins was in the &s;eat, and I &s;aw him peep that way every now and then."</P>
<P>"I rather think," replied the fir&s;t, "'twas Mrs. Bromfield's maid Grace, who was on the other &s;ide of the ai&s;le."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all the&s;e opinions were forming at K&mdash;, our hero was not le&s;s perplexed to find out why the church was le&s;s full in the after|noon than the morning; for never before having been &s;ix days together ab&s;ent from Warrington, where Mr. Thom&s;on always preached to as nu|merous a congregation as the village
<PB N="90" REF="91">
afforded, he was yet to learn, that to pray in an afternoon was equally unfa&s;hionable and unnece&s;&s;ary; for that going to church more than once on a Sunday was a work of &s;uper-erogation, and con&s;equently incon|&s;i&s;tent with our religion. He was him&s;elf the &s;imple child of nature, and had been taught both by Mr. Thom&s;on and his father, and the for|mer had particularly enforced it, that a con&s;tant attendance on public &s;er|vice was a very principal duty of religion; and he never forgot the precepts once in&s;tilled into him. Be|&s;ides, as the dinner hour at Warring|ton Ca&s;tle on a Sunday was always regulated by Mr. Thom&s;on, who,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
indeed, generally partook of it, he had no idea that people of demi-fa&s;hion in a country town con&s;idered it a reflection on their dignity, to be &s;een at church at an hour when they ought to be at table, as they mu&s;t in|cur the di&s;grace of being &s;uppo&s;ed to dine at the &s;ame time with their more humble neighbours.</P>
<P>Not able to &s;ettle this point to his own &s;atisfaction, our hero walked &s;lowly to his inn; and, it being too late to ramble about the town as he had done in the morning, he employ|ed him&s;elf till the tea was brought up in recapitulating the events of the week, which had given him more
<PB N="92" REF="93">
knowledge of the world than he had ever before acquired. The variety of characters he had &s;een in the Thorn|ton and Goldney families amu&s;ed him on the recollection; but the idea of Loui&s;a in&s;pired him with love and hope; and he could have dwelt on her image for ever. Lo&s;t in a thou|&s;and gay reveries and plea&s;ing day dreams, he was di&s;turbed by the en|trance of the waiter with the tea; and, unable to recover the &s;ame train of thought, he &s;at down pen&s;ive and melancholy to his &s;olitary table. When he had fini&s;hed, he a&s;ked the man if his ma&s;ter could lend him a book for the evening. He replied, "he would enquire;" and &s;oon returned
<PB N="93" REF="94">
with one of tho&s;e &s;editious, yet dan|gerous becau&s;e plau&s;ible, publica|tions with which the pre&s;s at this period groaned. This &s;uited his ta&s;te, completely engaged his atten|tion, and again renewed all the he|roi&s;m of his brea&s;t, which the gentler attacks of love had for a few mi|nutes &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but not &s;ubdued. He only fini&s;hed it when it was time to retire to re&s;t; and, on laying it down, re&s;olved to &s;tay no longer at Mr. Wilmot's than would be nece&s;|&s;ary to form &s;ome plan for his future conduct.</P>
<P>The next morning that gentleman &s;ummoned him to perform his pro|mi&s;e;
<PB N="94" REF="95">
and they &s;et out at an early hour, travelling many miles acro&s;s the country, yet in a direction that brought them towards London, from whence Violet Hill was di&s;tant only thirty miles. At the clo&s;e of day they arrived, and our hero met with a very polite reception from all the family; and, for the fir&s;t time in his life, found him&s;elf under the roof with four ladies, of whom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wilmot was a woman of a very peculiar kind: &s;he had no character at all: though this a&s;&s;ertion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mine is in direct oppo&s;ition to that line of
<PB N="95" REF="96">
Pope which declares it to be the fate of mo&s;t women: but this I deny; nor will any of my readers contradict me. Let them recollect whether, among their own acquaintance, the generality of the fair &s;ex do not be|long to &s;ome of the following cla&s;&s;es: the gay, the witty, the learned, the pedantic, the re&s;erved, the capricious, the extravagant, the covetous, the vain, the haughty, the humble, or the fanta&s;tic. But Mrs. Wilmot had a claim to none of the&s;e characteri&s;|tics: &s;he was equally free from vir|tues and from vices; the mo&s;t ex|treme and unconquerable indolence was the only prominent feature of her mind. However, as, by a &s;ort
<PB N="96" REF="97">
of mechanical management, without much exertion, &s;he contrived to pre|&s;ide in the family and to regulate it without extravagance, Mr. Wilmot was very well contented. He knew &s;he did not &s;ave &s;o much as the wives of &s;ome of his acquaintance, but then he was well a&s;&s;ured &s;he did not &s;pend; and, on an average, he thought him|&s;elf more fortunate than many of his friends who&s;e ladies decorated their own per&s;ons with what they &s;pared from the hou&s;e and table. But the mo&s;t unpardonable effect of her ne|gligence was, the little pains &s;he took to adorn her daughters and &s;et them forward in the world. Unlike all mothers, &s;he never con&s;ulted their
<PB N="97" REF="98">
per&s;ons or their appearance in the pattern of a new gown; was never &s;olicitous to chaperon them to pub|lic places, or contrive &s;chemes to draw in young men to dance with them; never was anxious to invite gentlemen of fortune to their hou&s;e, and then entertain them with the &s;u|perior merit of her children, &s;aying, "what a good wife the elde&s;t would make! and how well &s;he under&s;tood the oeconomy of a family! hinting that the Mi&s;s Beechcrofts and the Mi&s;s Anne&s;lys knew nothing but the fa&s;hions: that the younge&s;t was &s;uch a mild-tempered creature, &s;he mu&s;t never marry unle&s;s &s;he met with a man as amiable as her&s;elf; and
<PB N="98" REF="99">
that the &s;econd was, in any kind of ill|ne&s;s, the be&s;t nur&s;e imaginable."</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that, when mo|thers are thus tacitly recommending their daughters, they dwell chiefly on their mild and prudent perfections, &s;eldom &s;peaking of their wit, viva|city, talents, or accompli&s;hments. The rea&s;on is obvious: they are not always acquainted with the ta&s;te of tho&s;e they are addre&s;&s;ing, and are con&s;cious that every man wi&s;hes for a &s;weet-tempered and prudent companion in his weary and often turbulent pil|grimage through life; and that many fear &s;uperior talents, keen wit, and unbounded vivacity&mdash;knowing how
<PB N="99" REF="100">
frequently they lead to great incon|veniencies, particularly if not ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame advantages them&s;elves. The Mi&s;s Wilmots, ob&s;erving their mother's inactivity in this re&s;pect (which hurt them the more &s;en&s;ibly as they &s;aw none of their female ac|quaintance labouring under the &s;ame misfortune), determined to act for them&s;elves, and perhaps had &s;ucceed|ed better than mo&s;t of their young friends.</P>
<P>Myrtilla, the elde&s;t&mdash;Here let me digre&s;s a moment from this part of my hi&s;tory to inform my readers, that Mr. Wilmot, when fir&s;t married,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
had an aunt who was deeply read in pa&s;toral romance, and fondly at|tached to him. She therefore pur|cha&s;ed the hou&s;e and grounds where he now lived, and pre&s;ented it to him on condition that it was called Violet Hill. Of cour&s;e he made no objection to the terms; but gladly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place, which, with the lands around it, was worth at lea&s;t five hundred a year. She al&s;o promi&s;ed to leave a con&s;iderable &s;um to all his children who were named according to her fancy; and a&s;&s;enting as willingly to this, his three girls (for he had no &s;on) were called Myrtilla, Ro&s;etta, and Fidelia: and
<PB N="101" REF="102">
on the old lady's death they found them&s;elves entitled to four thou&s;and pounds each.</P>
<P>To return to Mi&s;s Wilmot:&mdash;She was every thing her name expre&s;&s;ed: as her good &s;en&s;e, her cheerful and &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, proved &s;he would be, like an evergreen, always loved, always admired, even in the winter of her exi&s;tence; whil&s;t her fair and florid complexion, dimpled cheeks, blue eyes, and light brown hair, made every one who &s;aw her pronounce her at pre&s;ent a myrtle in full bloom; and by that epithet &s;he was often toa&s;ted in her native county, where her me|rits
<PB N="102" REF="103">
were as well known as her beauty.</P>
<P>Myrtilla had been for many months attached to a young officer, who well de&s;erved her regard. In fact &s;he was engaged to him, though &s;he had not yet made it known to any of her fa|mily. He was at this time many miles di&s;tant from Violet Hill; but, relying on his con&s;tancy, &s;he had none of tho&s;e tender jealous appre|hen&s;ions which often di&s;turb the tranquillity of young ladies when ab&s;ent from their &s;oul's delight. On the contrary, &s;he was remarkably cheerful; from a conviction that her
<PB N="103" REF="104">
own heart was well be&s;towed, and that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one in return worthy her true&s;t affection.</P>
<P>Ro&s;etta, or Ro&s;e as &s;he was u&s;ually called, was of a mind and character totally the rever&s;e of Mi&s;s Wilmot's. In her per&s;on &s;he was much &s;uperior, as her figure was fine and her face uncommonly beautiful; her eyes black and &s;parkling; her complexion a clear brunette, with a bloom that by her lovers was often &s;aid to exceed the blu&s;hes of her vegetable name&s;akes: and this was as little of an hyperbole as po&s;&s;ible: but, alas! like them &s;he had only her bloom to depend on, having few mental attrac|tions
<PB N="104" REF="105">
and few real virtues. In fact, &s;he was a complete woman of the world, who doted on di&s;&s;ipation, courted admiration, loved her&s;elf ex|tremely, and cared for no one el&s;e. Such was her rage for unbounded triumph, that, had &s;he led the world in chains, like Alexander, &s;he would have &s;at down and wept there were no more worlds to conquer. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, I believe &s;he would have glad|ly mounted the griffin hor&s;e behind A&s;tolpho, when he vi&s;ited the moon: but not, like that hero, to re&s;tore the wits of her acquaintance, who had proved their folly by their extreme attachment to her; rather to &s;teal tho&s;e of the inhabitants of the lunar
<PB N="105" REF="106">
&s;phere, if they were vulnerable to &s;uch mortal weapons as &s;parkling eyes, white teeth, and coral lips.</P>
<P>Fidelia, the younge&s;t girl, re&s;em|bled neither of her &s;i&s;ters. With much of the romance of her great aunt, &s;he had &s;ome of the indolence of her mo|ther; and, though generally &s;o oppo|&s;ite, had contrived to blend the&s;e qualities in her own character. She knew it required more exertion to be a woman of fa&s;hion than &s;he loved, and was al&s;o &s;en&s;ible that &s;he had fewer per&s;onal attractions than either Myrtilla or Ro&s;etta, and con&s;equently would &s;hine le&s;s in the great world. Convinced of this, &s;he affected &s;im|plicity
<PB N="106" REF="107">
&mdash;loved the country&mdash;courted &s;olitude&mdash;invoked the zephyrs&mdash;&s;troll|ed for hours in woods and &s;hades with a volume of poems in her hand&mdash; li&s;tened to the long of the nightin|gale or the ru&s;hing of the ca&s;cades&mdash; rambled among ruins&mdash;explored caves&mdash;cheri&s;hed the young birds&mdash; cultivated the garden&mdash;and was al|ternately a flori&s;t, a botani&s;t, and a naturali&s;t.</P>
<P>Her dre&s;s was always &s;uited to her ideas and avocations: white jackets, &s;traw hats tied under her chin with ro&s;e-coloured or blue ribbons, were her principal decorations; and &s;he was well aware that this &s;tyle of dre&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="108">
&s;uited her per&s;on better than any other, for her complexion was rather white than fair, her eyes &s;mall light grey, and her hair, which &s;he wore in ringlets without powder, was ra|ther yellow than flaxen: but as her features were tolerable, the extreme &s;implicity of her dre&s;s and the appa|rent languor of her countenance gave her an intere&s;ting appearance, which &s;eldom failed to plea&s;e; but as, like Mrs. Cornelia Lizard in the Guar|dian, &s;he thought even a &s;hady grove or a meandering &s;tream could be im|proved by the pre&s;ence of a Cory|don, the introduction of our hero gave her an object of attention as well as her &s;i&s;ter Ro&s;etta, who at fir&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="109">
&s;ight marked him for her own; and, learning he was a Baronet of con&s;i|derable and independent fortune, be|gan to think it was not impo&s;&s;ible but &s;he might in his favour re&s;ign that liberty &s;he had &s;o fondly che|ri&s;hed. Mi&s;s Wilmot was glad of his arrival as a plea&s;ant addition to their family-circle, and Fidelia re|&s;olved to &s;teal into his heart unper|ceived: indeed, had &s;he done &s;o, it might have been totally without his knowledge. This young lady was as proud of her chri&s;tian name as if it &s;tamped on her heart the virtue it expre&s;&s;ed; for faithfulne&s;s is the quin|te&s;&s;ence of a heroine of romance; and &s;he piqued her&s;elf on it not a little;
<PB N="109" REF="110">
though frequently mortified when her &s;i&s;ters were addre&s;&s;ed by the names of Myrtle and Ro&s;e, when &s;he was only di&s;tingui&s;hed by that of Mi&s;s Fiddy, as from cu&s;tom &s;he was always called by her father and mother, as well as the &s;ervants of the family.</P>

<P>OUR hero had been only a few days an inhabitant of Violet Hill, when his extreme anxiety to learn &s;ome intelligence of the fair Loui&s;a determined him to go to London; but, on mentioning it at dinner, it was &s;o &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the whole fa|mily that he found him&s;elf obliged to yield; Mr. Wilmot having &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him that he might ea&s;ily &s;end for the letter as well as his port|manteau, both of which were direct|ed to the &mdash; coffee-hou&s;e; and
<PB N="111" REF="112">
in con&s;equence of his following this plan, they arrived in &s;afety the following day. He was walking with Mr. Wilmot in the park, but, happening to return alone, was &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e at hearing a violent debate among the ladies: not choo&s;ing to retreat le&s;t it &s;hould be imagined he had li&s;tened, he opened the door in&s;tantly, and &s;aw Mi&s;s Wilmot with a letter in her hand, which &s;he held high as if to pre&s;erve it from in&s;pection. Ro&s;etta and Fidelia walked towards the win|dow in evident confu&s;ion; but Myr|tilla, recovering in&s;tant compo&s;ure, addre&s;&s;ed Sir George with a good-humoured frankne&s;s, calculated to take away all &s;u&s;picion that &s;he had
<PB N="112" REF="113">
&s;eriou&s;ly quarrelled with her &s;i&s;ters&mdash; which was really the ca&s;e.&mdash;"Oh!" cried &s;he, "I am glad you are come, to &s;ecure your own property. Here is the precious long-expected letter, which the&s;e idle girls would have taken from me to &s;ee if the direction was in a female hand; for they ima|gine nothing but an attachment could have made you &s;o anxious for its arri|val." The young ladies, relieved by their &s;i&s;ter's &s;peech, now re&s;umed their &s;eats; and Sir George, taking the let|ter, replied gallantly, "he was much flattered by their curio&s;ity, which he would immediately gratify:" then breaking the &s;eal, he &s;hewed them the &s;ignature was William Thom&s;on.
<PB N="113" REF="114">
They attempted to laugh it off; but the extreme agitation of his counte|nance whil&s;t he peru&s;ed the contents &s;trengthened their &s;u&s;picions, which the name of Thom&s;on had not le&s;|&s;ened; as in fact they had all &s;een the direction, and were well aware it was from a gentleman; but, imagining it concerned a lady, had attempted to hold it open, and peru&s;e it in part: but Myrtilla, who&s;e integrity would have &s;corned &s;uch a &s;tep even if &s;he had been intere&s;ted in it, immediately prevented them; and it was this which had occa&s;ioned the high words our hero had overheard, though on his abrupt entrance &s;he gave it a more favourable turn, and treated it as a
<PB N="114" REF="115">
mere je&s;t, and as &s;uch Sir George re|garded it.</P>
<P>When Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot en|tered the room, the former, ob&s;erving he was much agitated, enquired the cau&s;e, adding, "he hoped the letter had brought him no bad news." Not wi&s;hing to make it a &s;ecret in a fa|mily who&s;e kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality had induced him to regard them as old friends, he related in a few words his accidental meeting with Mi&s;s Moreland, added a &s;hort &s;ketch of her hi&s;tory, and then gave to Mr. Wilmot the letter he had ju&s;t receiv|ed, who read aloud as follows:
<LETTER>
<PB N="115" REF="116">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR GEORGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much &s;urpri&s;ed and con|cerned at the contents of your let|ter brought me by the Bellingham carrier this morning: by the date of it, I think I ought to have received that of which Mi&s;s Moreland is the bearer &s;ome days &s;ince; but no lady of that de&s;cription has appeared in our village, and, as I have been con|fined to the hou&s;e for this week pa&s;t, with a &s;light attack of the gout, I could not have mi&s;&s;ed her. I grieve to wound your kind and generous heart by the idea I have taken up; yet I mu&s;t inform you, I fear &s;he was an impo&s;tor, who dre&s;&s;ed up a romantic
<PB N="116" REF="117">
tale to intere&s;t your feelings, and then availed her&s;elf of your bounty; for what could detain her &s;o long upon the road, &s;tranger as &s;he is in this country? if indeed &s;he is a &s;tranger. I will not trifle longer with your im|patience by detaining this another po&s;t, but write again in a few days, if I &s;hould gain any intelligence of the fair Loui&s;a; to whom, if &s;he arrives, we will pay every po&s;&s;ible attention. My wife joins me in every ardent and good wi&s;h for your &s;afety. I remain, my dear young friend,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">Various were the comments on this letter. Mrs. Wilmot &s;aid "&s;he did not know what to think," becau&s;e in fact &s;he gave her&s;elf no concern about it. Mr. Wilmot expre&s;&s;ed his fears that "Mr. Thom&s;on's ideas were too well founded." The two younger girls joined very warmly in his opi|nion, and declared they had not the lead doubt of her being an impo&s;tor, and that &s;uch things were now &s;o common as &s;carcely to afford a mo|ment's wonder. Myrtilla oppo&s;ed them earne&s;tly, &s;aying, "a thou&s;and accidents might have prevented her immediate arrival, and at lea&s;t they ought to &s;u&s;pend their judgment till better convinced of her unworthi|ne&s;s."
<PB N="118" REF="119">
Sir George, in his heart and with his eyes, thanked her for her candour, and expre&s;&s;ed his own &s;en|timents &s;imilar to hers. Ro&s;etta gave her head a to&s;s; Fidelia hung hers down, heaved a deep &s;igh, and ap|peared to &s;tifle her ri&s;ing emotion; but this little gentle artifice was wholly lo&s;t upon Sir George, who now admired Myrtilla more than he had ever done before, though, from the moment he entered the hou&s;e, &s;he was his favourite: and at this in|&s;tant he was contemplating her fair and open countenance with a degree of plea&s;ure that might have ended in love, had not the &s;till more beautiful Loui&s;a taken her &s;tation in the cen|tre
<PB N="119" REF="120">
of his heart, from which neither his own doubt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Ro&s;etta's ill-natured &s;u&s;picions, nor Fidelia's pretended pa&s;&s;ion, had the power to remove her. Sir George, finding only Myrtilla on his &s;ide, dropped the &s;ubject, and &s;oon after quitted the room to write to his old friend, rejoicing, as he ex|pected to hear again, that he had ta|ken the precaution to &s;end his pre|&s;ent addre&s;s to the coffee-hou&s;e, with a reque&s;t that all letters might be immediately forwarded to him. And the next morning brought him ano|ther from the good Vicar, containing only a few lines, to acquaint him "Mi&s;s Moreland was ju&s;t arrived at Warrington, and that whil&s;t &s;he was
<PB N="120" REF="121">
laid down to recover from the fatigue of her journey, he had &s;eized the pen to apologize for his unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions. He added &s;he had been detained by a &s;evere illne&s;s; but that Sir George &s;hould not be unea&s;y, as her counte|nance retained no trace of indi&s;po&s;i|tion. He concluded by a&s;&s;uring him that every po&s;&s;ible attention and re|&s;pect &s;hould be paid to her both by him&s;elf and Mrs. Thom&s;on."</P>
<P>Our hero immediately communi|cated the contents of this letter to the family. Myrtilla received the intelligence with plea&s;ure; her &s;i&s;ters with infinite mortification, though they endeavoured to conceal it by
<PB N="121" REF="122">
declaring "they were extremely happy that the poor young lady was &s;afely arrived at Warrington."</P>
<P>The following day Violet Hill was enlivened by a new gue&s;t&mdash;the Mr. Davenport who has been already mentioned. Mr. Wilmot introduced him to Sir George with particular &s;a|tisfaction, con&s;cious from the &s;imila|rity of their &s;entiments they would e&s;teem each other; for Mr. Wilmot, who was a man of plain rather than &s;hrewd under&s;tanding, &s;aw nothing in his in&s;idious friend but a warmth of heart that led him to act in a right cau&s;e for the good of his country
<PB N="122" REF="123">
and the univer&s;al benefit of man|kind.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport immediately di&s;|covered in our hero that openne&s;s of temper, that frankne&s;s of heart, and genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, which rendered him a con&s;iderable acqui&s;ition to their party&mdash;and a &s;implicity of character that he thought would render it ea&s;y for them to lead him to their own purpo&s;es: at the &s;ame time ob&s;erved he acted from principle and right feeling; that his under&s;tanding was &s;o good they mu&s;t behave with cau|tion, and his heart at once &s;o pure and &s;o benevolent, that, till he was too deeply intangled in their &s;nares
<PB N="123" REF="124">
to extricate him&s;elf, they mu&s;t care|fully conceal their own motives, and as much as po&s;&s;ible the horrible con|&s;equences which had en&s;ued, and would &s;till en&s;ue, from the French Revolution. For this purpo&s;e, in their fir&s;t political conver&s;ation, which took place when the ladies were with|drawn from dinner, Mr. Davenport per&s;uaded our hero to give up his intended excur&s;ion to France: too &s;en&s;ible that at this period the waters of the Seine, as it was wittily expre&s;&s;|ed in one of the new&s;papers, had a powerful effect in curing the repub|lican mania when it attacked Eng|li&s;hmen. His plea for this was, that it would be more proper and more
<PB N="124" REF="125">
u&s;eful to &s;tay at home, and endea|vour to emancipate his own coun|trymen from the degree of &s;lavery which, even under the name of liberty, oppre&s;&s;ed them; to reduce the taxes, and to equali&s;e mankind.</P>
<P>Sir George, &s;oon convinced by the&s;e arguments, at once gave up his plan; adding as an inducement, that "it would give real &s;atisfaction to his old friend and tutor in the north, who had &s;trongly oppo&s;ed it." When Mr. Davenport heard this, he judged very prudently he &s;hould do well to keep our hero from any interview with this old gentleman, till his principles in their favour were fixed on a firmer
<PB N="125" REF="126">
ba&s;is; therefore, on his next conver|&s;ation with Mr. Wilmot, he hinted the propriety of keeping their new acquaintance among them for a-while; who the more readily acceded to this &s;cheme, from a conviction that the company of our hero was agreeable to his daughters, and not unplea&s;ant to his wife, as it gave her no trou|ble. Female gue&s;ts, unle&s;s quite young people, &s;he always objected to, from the nece&s;&s;ity of paying them tho&s;e attentions which &s;uited not her indolence: but Sir George was a real acqui&s;ition to the whole family; and when, at the in&s;tance of Mr. Daven|port, Mr. Wilmot in&s;i&s;ted on his promi&s;ing to &s;tay with them &s;everal
<PB N="126" REF="127">
weeks, he made no objection: he perceived he &s;hould not be idle in the cau&s;e he had undertaken; and the manner of living and the &s;ociety he met with at Violet Hill were too well &s;uited to his ta&s;te for him to wi&s;h to leave it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Davenport now u&s;ed every artifice, every machination, to com|plete the infatuation of our hero, and &s;ucceeded but too well: he relied on him with implicit confidence, follow|ed his in&s;tructions, li&s;tened to his &s;ugge&s;tions, and obeyed his dictates. Without an atom of extravagance or licentiou&s;ne&s;s in his own character, he drew for &s;uch incredible &s;ums on his banker in London as made him liable to the imputation of both. The&s;e, his fal&s;e friend continually
<PB N="128" REF="129">
told him, were for the benefit of his country, and they were placed in his hands without enquiry and without &s;u&s;picion. If any new pernicious idea was to be inculcated, Mr. Da|venport put it in the mouth of our hero, who incautiou&s;ly &s;pread &s;uch opinions as might have rendered him liable to a charge for high trea|&s;on. And yet in all this time he fancied he was acting in the cau&s;e of virtue, and con&s;equently of religion: for he yet knew no di&s;tinction; Mr. Davenport &s;edulou&s;ly avoiding every thing that could open his eyes. In any public meeting, where the&s;e opi|nions were the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Davenport would de&s;ire the gen|tlemen
<PB N="129" REF="130">
to be cautious, for that his friend was very pious, and would take a &s;udden fright and run off if he &s;u&s;|pected their party di&s;claimed all re|ligion. All the bloody ma&s;&s;acres which had happened in France were by him a&s;cribed to a murderous ban|ditti, and not the general &s;en&s;e of the people&mdash;committed by a lawle&s;s mob, not licen&s;ed by the real patriots. Alas! our hero had not yet con&s;idered the mob could never have been lawle&s;s but for the licen&s;e of their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Thus was the mind of Sir George continually worked upon for &s;ome time, till Mr. Davenport, being &s;ud|denly called to London, left him at
<PB N="130" REF="131">
re&s;t. He &s;ometimes thought it was po&s;&s;ible he might be acting wrong; but the&s;e qualms were &s;oon checked by his friend, who, in the mo&s;t al|luring but fal&s;e colours, had paint|ed the univer&s;al advantages of a ge|neral reform. Mi&s;s Wilmot, who &s;aw things in their true light, was grieved that her father and Sir George &s;hould take up a wrong cau&s;e; but, not knowing how to remedy it, lamented their infatuation in &s;ilence. Ro&s;etta and Fidelia regretted it on another account, that our hero was now &s;o con&s;tantly engaged as to af|ford them little opportunity for their meditated conque&s;t. The ab&s;ence of Mr. Davenport gave them all more
<PB N="131" REF="132">
lei&s;ure; but the tranquillity of Sir George was totally de&s;troyed by the arrival of a letter from Mr. Thom&s;on, which I will tran&s;cribe verbatim for my readers:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR GEORGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE di&s;like I naturally feel to giving pain to any one, particularly tho&s;e to whom I am united by the bands of friend&s;hip, has for &s;ome days prevented my writing, though convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; but it can be no longer deferred, as Mrs. Thom&s;on is really ill from her continued exertions, and I am my&s;elf far from well. The fact is, my dear friend, your proteg&eacute;e
<PB N="132" REF="133">
Mi&s;s Moreland is too young, too hand&s;ome, and too volatile, for our peace; and by far too great a charge for an old &s;edate couple, now declin|ing in health and totally ignorant of the ways of the world. I dare be|lieve it is only French manners, though in England we &s;hould call it levity, if not licentiou&s;ne&s;s. In &s;hort, her conduct is &s;uch as we can neither admire nor approve; there|fore beg you will fix on &s;ome plan to relieve us from what we have long con&s;idered as a burthen. I will, if you impower me, look out for &s;ome place where &s;he may board and lodge till &s;he has determined on a &s;cheme for her future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but of this
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;he has at pre&s;ent no idea. I know not why I am &s;o cautious; you de|&s;ired my frank opinion of her, and, if I do not give my rea&s;ons, you will probably think I judge too &s;everely of youthful follies. To the point&mdash; She came to us in a very mi&s;erable condition, entirely bare of clothes and money; the &s;um which you had given her &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;pent in her ill|ne&s;s, and was obliged to part with mo&s;t of the former to defray her ad|ditional expences. At her de&s;ire therefore, as I had previou&s;ly your leave, I gave her thirty pounds, which did not go far, as &s;he &s;pent it very injudiciou&s;ly, not accepting my wife's advice, who wi&s;hed her to
<PB N="134" REF="135">
lay it out in nece&s;&s;aries; but, in&s;tead of that, it all went for finery of which I &s;carcely know the name. She then demanded twenty pounds more: I he&s;itated, but at length obeyed, as you had not limited me. I thought to inform you of this, but con&s;idered, as &s;he was actually in want of every thing, the &s;um was not &s;o enormous. When properly equipped, &s;he made frequent excur&s;ions to Bellingham, and introduced her&s;elf to every body there as your proteg&eacute;e, and was con&s;e|quently noticed by all the town. She went to the a&s;&s;embly with the Kette|rings, who have paid her great at|tention; and I &s;at up for her till two o'clock, at which time &s;he returned
<PB N="135" REF="136">
in a po&s;tchai&s;e with an officer who had been her partner during the even|ing. She a&s;ked him in, though at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable an hour, and ordered the maid, who was in waiting to warm her bed, to bring in &s;upper, with as much effrontery as if &s;he had been in her own hou&s;e. This was complied with; and I brought out two bottles of wine. I could not leave them either in politene&s;s or propriety; and the officer &s;taid till he had fini&s;hed the wine, of which, however, the lady had her due &s;hare. The next morning I ventured to re|mon&s;trate, and was an&s;wered by a to&s;s of the head, and an a&s;&s;urance that &s;he would not trouble me long, as in
<PB N="136" REF="137">
all probability Sir George would &s;oon return, and &s;he &s;hould then remove to the Ca&s;tle. My dear young friend, I hope this is not true, for your &s;ake. I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o far de|viate from tho&s;e principles of recti|tude you once gloried in, as to keep a mi&s;tre&s;s, openly in defiance of all morality: yet I &s;hould be &s;till more concerned to &s;ee you united for life to &s;uch a woman as Mi&s;s Moreland, who, however infatuating &s;he appear|ed to you, is I fear a very bad young creature. Indeed I do not wonder you were deceived, &s;ince for &s;everal days &s;he &s;eemed to us a very mild pretty-&s;poken young woman; but the ma&s;k is now thrown off. It is talked
<PB N="137" REF="138">
of all over Bellingham that you mean to marry her; and in con&s;equence of the&s;e hints, thrown out by her&s;elf, &s;he is much courted. Mi&s;s Kettering declares &s;he is quite the woman of fa|&s;hion, and as &s;uch imitates her in every thing. Mi&s;s Carruther, who&s;e word I would much &s;ooner take, as &s;he has &s;een more of the world, &s;ays it may be foreign, but it is not Engli&s;h fa|&s;hionable manners; and I believe &s;he is right; yet &s;he is very fond of her, and invites her frequently to her hou&s;e. Indeed I have ob&s;erved, though I cannot gue&s;s the rea&s;on, that lady is very fond of new ac|quaintance: but to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">A few days &s;ince, I heard of Mr. Saxby's return, and came to the par|&s;onage in great joy to inform Mi&s;s Moreland of it, thinking &s;he would be glad to &s;ee her old friends James and Lucy; but &s;he received my in|telligence very coldly, though &s;he coloured with &s;urpri&s;e when fir&s;t I told her, and &s;oon after &s;aid "&s;he mu&s;t be very cautious of going out, as &s;he was afraid of Mr. Saxby, who&s;e wife was not jealous of him without good rea&s;on." I judged from this, there had been &s;ome impertinence in his conduct towards her, which &s;he had not mentioned to you; at the &s;ame time wondered why &s;he was &s;o fear|ful, as I have &s;een &s;everal young
<PB N="139" REF="140">
gentlemen who have called on her at my hou&s;e take liberties with her that I deemed extraordinary. However, in a few days &s;he &s;uddenly changed her re&s;olution, and took a long walk, by her&s;elf as I thought; but Dick Atkins the clerk told me, "he met her with Mr. Saxby at the upper &s;tile leading to the high field between your park and Barclay Manor, and &s;ince that &s;he has been &s;een with him once or twice. I know he is a very gay libertine man, and therefore all this makes me very unea&s;y. She is going tomorrow to a ball, given at the Wood by Sir William Arlington on his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate. We are not to &s;it up for her, as &s;he
<PB N="140" REF="141">
goes with Mrs. Kettering and will &s;leep there. My wife and I antici|pate with plea&s;ure one quiet and un|di&s;turbed evening, which we have not enjoyed &s;ince her arrival. Let me know your commands, my dear Sir George, in a few days at farthe&s;t, at lea&s;t as &s;oon as you can determine. In the mean time, believe me ever</P>

<P>TO de&s;cribe the emotion of Sir George as he read this is impo&s;&s;ible. All the fair vi&s;ions of love and joy that had &s;o long floated in his brain were at once de&s;troyed: all the bright illu&s;ions that had animated his mind were no more. Totally engro&s;&s;ed by the idea of his di&s;appointment, and forgetting he might be laughed at for his credulity, or, if not forget|ting, di&s;regarding it, he went into the drawing-room to &s;eek for that con&s;olation &s;o heart-&s;oothing in the
<PB N="142" REF="143">
hour of di&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;o &s;eldom expe|rienced. With that na&iuml;vet&eacute; which his farther acquaintance with the world had not yet robbed him of, he read the letter to the family, begged their pity, and de&s;ired their advice; both of which he received in great abundance&mdash;at lea&s;t it was the &s;emblance of the fir&s;t, from all but Myrtilla, who &s;incerely felt for him, judging of his heart by her own, and &s;en&s;ible how acutely he mu&s;t feel the mortification of &s;eeing his be&s;t hopes vani&s;h like a &s;hadow; for to her he had confe&s;&s;ed, "he was as much attached to Mi&s;s Moreland as he could po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;o &s;hort a time." Advice &s;he gave him none;
<PB N="143" REF="144">
ob&s;erving he was in no pre&s;ent want of it. Mr. Wilmot &s;hook his head and &s;aid, "it was a very &s;trange af|fair." Mrs. Wilmot, yawning, echo|ed his opinion, and was &s;ilent. Ro|&s;etta exclaimed, "Mi&s;s Morela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d was the vile&s;t wretch in the univer&s;e; and, if Sir George wi&s;hed to act like a man of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, he would in|form his friend that he meant totally to withdraw his countenance from her, and de&s;ire &s;he might be in&s;tantly turned out of doors, and &s;tripped of all &s;he had &s;o di&s;hone&s;tly gained." Fidelia recommended a milder me|thod. "Let her," &s;aid &s;he, "be &s;ent away from Warrington, but not de&s;titute and pennyle&s;s; let her be
<PB N="144" REF="145">
brought back to the place from whence &s;he was taken by you, and then &s;he may follow her own inclina|tions."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot now &s;poke with her u&s;ual animation. "Sir George, it is vi&s;ible to us all, you have felt more than a common regard for Mi&s;s Moreland; that regard I &s;hould hope would exi&s;t no longer, &s;ince, from the account of a friend on whom you can rely, &s;he appears unde&s;erving of it: but as &s;he has been guilty of no ac|tual crime, therefore let us &s;u&s;pend our cen&s;ures; and give me leave to add, &s;hould you entirely for&s;ake her, if at any future time you &s;hould hear
<PB N="145" REF="146">
of her certain di&s;grace and inevitable ruin, you may be &s;orry for your ra&s;h|ne&s;s. Your fortune will allow you to part with a trifle; and, as you vo|luntarily offered her an aid &s;he did not &s;olicit, why do you not reply to Mr. Thom&s;on, that you will pay any moderate &s;um to enable her to get an hone&s;t and independent livelihood, but that you never meant to &s;upport her in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation? If &s;he accepts your offer, you know not how far the benefit may extend: if her pride induces her to decline it, you are not accountable for any of her actions; but Mr. Thom&s;on may &s;end her at once from his hou&s;e, with
<PB N="146" REF="147">
a few guineas for her immediate re|lief."</P>
<P>Ro&s;etta and Fidelia &s;neered at their &s;i&s;ter's charitable oration, as they called it; but Sir George in the warme&s;t terms thanked her for put|ting him in a method to acquit his con&s;cience, and in&s;tantly wrote his letter. But as they were at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the po&s;t town, they &s;ent and received their letters only three times a week: the next was not po&s;t day; and Sir George, knowing it was of no immediate con&s;equence, did not &s;end a me&s;&s;enger on purpo&s;e. On the following, the man arrived
<PB N="147" REF="148">
from the town with the letters, who u&s;ually returned with theirs; but another from Mr. Thom&s;on to our hero rendered his written an&s;wer u&s;ele&s;s, and he threw it into the fire.</P>

<P>When I had &s;ent off my la&s;t letter to you by the carrier (for I would not tru&s;t Loui&s;a, though &s;he offered to put it into the po&s;t-office at Bellingham her&s;elf), I went into the parlour, and found her ready to &s;et out; and the chai&s;e at that moment drove up to the door. She told me '&s;he mu&s;t buy &s;everal things for her appearance that evening, as &s;he wi&s;h|ed not to di&s;grace your bounty,' and begged me to give her twenty pounds. The demand &s;tartled me; but recol|lecting
<PB N="149" REF="150">
your repeated orders, even &s;ince her arrival and &s;ince you knew of the fir&s;t fifty pounds, to &s;pare no expence for her accommodation, I did not know how to refu&s;e; but fortunately having only a ten pound note by me, I gave her that, and promi&s;ed her the remainder the next day. She &s;eemed di&s;concerted, but &s;aid nothing; and I led her to the chai&s;e, behind which I ob&s;erved her large&s;t travelling trunk. I pointed to it, and a&s;ked her, &s;miling, if &s;he meant to play truant for any length of time. She coloured, and replied, 'No; but &s;he had not yet fixed on what dre&s;s &s;he &s;hould wear, and had there|fore taken two or three; and, that
<PB N="150" REF="151">
they might not be pre&s;&s;ed, had put them in a large portmanteau.' I thought this very probable; and &s;he drove off, &s;aying '&s;he &s;hould not re|turn till the next day after dinner.' Of cour&s;e I did not expect her till that time; but, the evening coming on without her appearing, I grew un|ea&s;y, though I &s;carcely knew why, as my wife &s;aid 'it was po&s;&s;ible the Ketterings had prevailed on her to &s;tay with them till the next morning.' This idea relieved my mind, and I went to bed, but could not &s;leep. I aro&s;e early, and taking my hor&s;e rode over to Bellingham, and &s;topped at Mr. Kettering's. The family were at breakfa&s;t, and I was in&s;tantly ad|mitted;
<PB N="151" REF="152">
but, on my enquiring for Mi&s;s Moreland, their con&s;ternation was evident. I ha&s;tily demanded the cau&s;e, and was informed &s;he had left them the night of the ball, under a pretence that I was to &s;it up for her. Her elopement was now clear to all parties; but, when I learned the atro|city of her preceding conduct, I was &s;hocked beyond mea&s;ure. Mi&s;s Ket|tering told me, 'on her arrival at their hou&s;e, they &s;et out together to call on Mi&s;s Carruther, to hold a little female council on the important &s;ub|ject of their dre&s;s; and found that lady unfortunately &s;o ill with a &s;well|ed face, that &s;he had given up all thoughts of going her&s;elf.' Loui&s;a
<PB N="152" REF="153">
then lamented her own &s;ituation in pathetic terms, and, concealing the money &s;he had from me, declared 'her own appearance would be &s;o inferior to the re&s;t of the party, &s;he was half inclined to &s;tay with her.' This Mi&s;s Carruther generou&s;ly declined, and with infinite good-nature offered her the dre&s;s &s;he meant to have worn her|&s;elf, which was accepted without &s;cruple by the mean-&s;pirited girl. To this &s;he added her watch and pearl pins; and Mi&s;s Kettering, to contribute towards it, de&s;ired &s;he would wear the necklace and ear|rings lately &s;ent her by an uncle in London, as &s;he had another &s;et which would better &s;uit the re&s;t of
<PB N="153" REF="154">
her dre&s;s. Mi&s;s Moreland refu&s;ed nothing that was offered, and at the proper time, attired in her borrowed plumes, accompanied the Ketterings to Sir William Arlington's, where &s;he had her due &s;hare of admiration. When they returned, &s;he &s;aid '&s;he could not &s;leep with them, becau&s;e I or Mrs. Thom&s;on would wait for her;' but &s;he de&s;ired to have her portmanteau fa&s;tened on to the car|riage, as her morning gown was in it. Whil&s;t this was about, Mrs. Ketter|ing begged &s;he would alight, hinting, 'as it was &s;o late, it might be better to take off the watch, pins, &amp;c. and leave with them;' but &s;he re|plied&mdash;'No, &s;he would not alter her
<PB N="154" REF="155">
dre&s;s till her dear old friends had &s;een her, and witne&s;&s;ed the kindne&s;s of Mi&s;s Carruther and Mi&s;s Kettering.' The latter, therefore, could not pre&s;s it, le&s;t it might imply a fear of her lo&s;ing tho&s;e ornaments &s;he had &s;up|plied her with; and they parted. Her not returning the clothes the following day had &s;urpri&s;ed them all; but they had no doubt of hear|ing from her as on this morning; when my arrival &s;o unfortunately con|vinced them &s;he had taken an op|portunity of leaving the country, laden with the &s;poils of her friends. I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;incere concern at this information; and then, though too much time had elap&s;ed to afford any
<PB N="155" REF="156">
hopes of overtaking her, I thought it be&s;t to go to the inn, and enquire of the po&s;tillion to what place he had conveyed the lady. The man re|plied&mdash;'She ordered him to drive to Warrington, but that about three miles from Bellingham they met another carriage with four hor&s;es, and only one gentleman in it. Some conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between him and the lady, who then alighted and got into his chai&s;e: the trunk was re|moved; and giving the man half a crown, &s;he told him that gentleman would &s;ee her home; and he returned almo&s;t in&s;tantly, though he fancied, from the &s;ound, that the other car|riage
<PB N="156" REF="157">
took a different road from that which led to Warrington.</P>
<P>Finding I could gain no farther intelligence, I came back to Mr. Kettering's, who joined with me in believing &s;he had made an appoint|ment with &s;ome gentleman &s;he had &s;een at the ball, though he could not gue&s;s whom, as &s;everal had paid her very particular attention. No part of her conduct, terrible as it has been throughout, &s;hocks me &s;o much as her di&s;hone&s;ty in robbing all her be&s;t friends and benefactors; for you do not yet know the whole. I was ob|liged to take an early leave of Mr.
<PB N="157" REF="158">
Kettering's family, becau&s;e I expect|ed &s;ome farmers to dinner; and, on entering my own hou&s;e, was a&s;to|ni&s;hed at meeting my wife in the hall, with a countenance as pale as if &s;he had anticipated all my intelligence. I enquired what was the matter, but &s;he could not &s;peak; and old Su&s;an, running out of the kitchen, informed me that her mi&s;tre&s;s, on opening the che&s;t of plate that &s;tood in the com|mon parlour, had mi&s;&s;ed &s;everal large &s;poons and other things, which in|duced her to look farther; and, up &s;tairs in the &s;tore clo&s;et, al&s;o mi&s;&s;ed the large &s;ilver tankard given me by your father the day you were chri&s;tened. The arms of Warrington and Mil|banke
<PB N="158" REF="159">
quartered were engraved on it; and I valued it more as the gift of your family than on any other ac|count, though, as an old-fa&s;hioned heavy piece of plate, its intrin&s;ic worth was not trifling. I too &s;oon gue&s;&s;ed who had taken it; the infor|mation I had learnt at Bellingham made it too evident. My wife was le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than &s;he would have been, if Su&s;an had not told her '&s;he had &s;everal times &s;een Mi&s;s More|land coming out of the &s;tore-room, where &s;he knew &s;he had no bu&s;ine&s;s,' and in pretty plain terms hinted to her that Loui&s;a had concealed it. We now broke open the trunk &s;he had left at home, but found little
<PB N="159" REF="160">
more than the clothes &s;he came fir&s;t in to Warrington, which are of no value. Her guilt is now too clear to be di&s;puted; and, though I grieve to inform you of it, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, as you may put us in a way to reco|ver tho&s;e things &s;he has &s;o unju&s;tly taken. You had better apply to a good lawyer, who will tell you what mea&s;ures mu&s;t be followed; and in the mean time I will tran&s;mit to you a particular de&s;cription of the watch, ear-rings, &amp;c. The great tankard you would know; at all events, the arms would be a &s;ufficient proof of that. I am &s;o concerned and &s;o hara&s;&s;ed, that I &s;carcely know what I write, and mu&s;t leave off.

<P>IT is ea&s;ier to imagine than de&s;cribe the emotions of our hero on peru&s;ing this letter. Shame, grief, remor&s;e, di&s;appointment, and mortification, alternately ro&s;e in his &s;oul; and it was long ere he could recover a &s;uf|ficient degree of compo&s;ure to re|join the family. They all, on his entering the room, anxiou&s;ly enquired the cau&s;e of that di&s;tre&s;s &s;o vi&s;ible on his countenance. He could not reply; but, giving the letter to Mr. Wilmot, &s;at down in the window; whil&s;t the
<PB N="162" REF="163">
young ladies crowded round their fa|ther to learn what new misfortune had ari&s;en. Their curio&s;ity was &s;oon &s;atisfied; and, without paying any re|gard to the feelings of our hero, Ro|&s;etta and Fidelia, with all the malig|nity of gratified revenge, reproached Myrtilla for her credulity, and plumed them&s;elves on their own deeper penetration. Mi&s;s Wilmot with great calmne&s;s only replied, by repeating a maxim from Rochefou|cault: "Tho&s;e who are them&s;elves incapable of great crimes are not ready to &s;u&s;pect others of them."</P>
<P>They coloured with anger at this tacit reproof, and &s;aid "they did not
<PB N="163" REF="164">
under&s;tand her; but &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he meant to give Sir George an idea that her heart was as pure as an infant's, whil&s;t theirs was all that was vile: but that perhaps, if the truth were known, &s;ome people had deeper rea|&s;ons for their affected candour, though other people were condemned for their hone&s;t indignation and ju&s;t ab|horrence of vice."</P>
<P>This &s;peech, kind and &s;i&s;terly as it was, did not in the lea&s;t confu&s;e Myrtilla; for the fact was, &s;he had early in their acquaintance given Sir George a hint of her predilection in favour of an ab&s;ent lover, that the courte&s;y &s;he &s;eemed inclined to be&s;tow
<PB N="164" REF="165">
on him, and the regard &s;he already felt for his virtues, might not be mi&s;|con&s;trued.</P>
<P>Our hero, concerned at the di&s;pute which he feared would ari&s;e, endea|voured, but without &s;ucce&s;s, to turn the conver&s;ation. Ro&s;etta and Fi|delia renewed their dark &s;urmi&s;es and oblique hints, which Myrtilla bore with her u&s;ual patience; till Mr. Wilmot interfered, and in&s;i&s;ted on peace being re&s;tored. This even a father's authority could not effect: but a truce was proclaimed; and Sir George took the opportunity of quit|ting the room. He retired to his chamber, and, &s;trongly feeling the
<PB N="165" REF="166">
nece&s;&s;ity of replying to Mr. Thom|&s;on, however unwilling he was to at|tempt it, &s;at down and wrote as fol|lows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM more &s;hocked and con|cerned than I know how to expre&s;s at the contents of your two la&s;t let|ters, and am infinitely grieved at having been the means of di&s;turb|ing your dome&s;tic comfort. How &s;hall I ever repay your kindne&s;s to one who has proved &s;o unworthy of it! I may re&s;tore your actual lo&s;&s;es; but the obligation will ever be a weight on my mind, and the heavier weight as the object is &s;o totally un|de&s;erving.
<PB N="166" REF="167">
But, my good friend, no colours are &s;o glowing as tho&s;e traced by the pencil of fancy when guided by the hand of inexperienced youth; and in the countenance of Mi&s;s More|land I beheld all the virtues, and fondly hoped her eyes were the win|dows of her heart. Fancy led me a&s;tray &s;till farther, and I painted &s;cenes of future happine&s;s where &s;he was the principal figure: but this is all at an end; and I even blu&s;h for my infatuation, yet cannot &s;o far conquer it as to bring her to public ju&s;tice. Do not mention my folly, for I know &s;he merits puni&s;hment: yet ju&s;tice &s;hall be done to all tho&s;e &s;he has injured. Send me a de&s;crip|tion
<PB N="167" REF="168">
of the watch, pearl-pins, neck|lace, and ear-rings: if I can regain them by any le&s;s violent means than public pro&s;ecution, I will; but, if nor, tell me their utmo&s;t value, and it &s;hall be re&s;tored. As for your&s;elf, the be&s;t piece of plate at Warrington Ca&s;tle is yours. Indeed I will do any thing and every thing to repair my folly, for it has been weakne&s;s in the extreme. You will &s;mile if I confe&s;s, but it is truth&mdash;that I have not yet brought my mind to con&s;ider the Mi&s;s Moreland who has behaved &s;o ba&s;ely at Warrington as the &s;ame lovely woman I beheld at the inn. In fact, to the former I have annexed a different idea, and fancy her a tall
<PB N="168" REF="169">
ma&s;culine creature, with a florid com|plexion and &s;hewy features; whil&s;t of the latter, elegant, gentle, and ti|mid, I &s;till retain a perfect recollec|tion, and &s;till &s;eem to believe all the virtues in&s;hrined in that lovely form I then too fondly imagined &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. But I will conquer the&s;e vi|&s;ionary dreams, and dwell on them no longer. Adieu, my kinde&s;t friend, and believe me mo&s;t gratefully yours,</P>

<P>When our hero re-entered the par|lour, the two younger girls were ab|&s;ent, and all was quietne&s;s. Mr. Wilmot then told him "they had been talking over the affair, and were
<PB N="169" REF="170">
unitedly of opinion that Mi&s;s More|land, as &s;he called her&s;elf, had been a complete impo&s;tor from the begin|ning, and had framed a plau&s;ible and pathetic tale to deceive the guilele&s;s and unwary. And now," continued he, "that &s;he has gained all &s;he can from the effects of your bounty, &s;he is probably gone to &s;ome other part of the kingdom, to tell the &s;ame &s;tory and act the &s;ame part."</P>
<P>Sir George a&s;&s;ented to this opinion, declaring "it reconciled him to her conduct, as the idea of her growing &s;o &s;uddenly depraved had hurt his mind more than he could expre&s;s; &s;ince the amiable Loui&s;a attending on
<PB N="170" REF="171">
the dying Abbe&s;s, and giving up every temporal advantage for her comfort and happine&s;s, appeared a creature totally di&s;tinct from the vile intere&s;ted wretch who deceived and betrayed her be&s;t friends."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mi&s;s Wilmot, "I think that is evident; but indeed, Sir George, you mu&s;t lo&s;e her pretended virtues in her real ba&s;ene&s;s, or the fir&s;t idea you formed of her will dwell on your mind, and render you mi&s;erable; for I now too plainly &s;ee you are in love with a &s;hadow."</P>
<P>Sir George acknowledged the truth of this, and promi&s;ed if po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="171" REF="172">
to forget her. Mi&s;s Wilmot ap|plauded his re&s;olution, and then, to divert his attention, turned the con|ver&s;ation on indifferent &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening, a letter was brought to our hero from Mr. Davenport, reque&s;ting he would come to him to London for a few days, as he wi&s;hed to make him known to &s;ome of his friends. He at fir&s;t, from the unu&s;ual depre&s;&s;ion of his &s;pirits, re&s;olved to refu&s;e this re|que&s;t; but Mr. Wilmot, imagining change of &s;cene would re&s;tore his mind to its wonted &s;erenity, per|&s;uaded him not to decline it; and, ac|ceding to the&s;e rea&s;ons, Sir George

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the fortnight of our hero's continuance in London, his mornings were devoted to Mr. Da|venport, who introduced him to his friends, who were all of the demo|cratic party; and who received Sir George Warrington as an auxiliary with peculiar &s;atisfaction: but Mr. Davenport, aware of the &s;trictne&s;s of his principles, gave them a caution not to avow tho&s;e by which they were actuated, at lea&s;t too many of them; and le&s;t he &s;hould in their hours of
<PB N="174" REF="175">
conviviality di&s;cover what it was &s;o much his intere&s;t to conceal, he avoid|ed a&s;king him to join their dinner parties, under a pretence that they were too di&s;&s;ipated for him to re|ceive any plea&s;ure from their general &s;ociety. This Sir George was well convinced of, and not &s;orry for an excu&s;e which afforded him an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing more of the amu&s;e|ments than he could have done if con&s;tantly engaged in private par|ties. He &s;pent every evening at &s;ome public place, giving the preference to the theatres.</P>
<P>As his acquaintance was now chief|ly confined to a &s;et of people who,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
having only one point to gain, di|rected their views and their conver|&s;ation &s;olely to obtaining that end, he &s;aw very little variety of character, and met with no adventures: and though this, from the above-men|tioned circum&s;tance, might be ea&s;ily accounted for, he was &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash; hoping, in &s;o large a city as London, to meet with &s;ome who might af|ford him as much plea&s;ure in the re|collection as Mr. and Mrs. Thorn|ton, Mr. and Mrs. Goldney, and the poor author who had &s;upped with him at the King's Arms: but nothing of the kind occurred, except|ing that one morning &s;tepping into an ironmonger's &s;hop with his friend,
<PB N="176" REF="177">
who was commi&s;&s;ioned to be&s;peak a regi&s;ter &s;tove for a gentleman in the country, he &s;aw an in&s;tance of eco|nomy &s;carcely to be credited. Whil&s;t Mr. Davenport was giving his or|ders, our hero leaned pen&s;ively again&s;t the counter; and a lady alighting from a very elegant chai&s;e, a curious conver&s;ation en&s;ued between her and the foreman, which amu&s;ed him par|ticularly. The lady, who was newly &s;ettled in town, enquired if the bra&s;s plate &s;he had ordered with the name, for her &s;treet-door, was fini&s;hed. The man replied in the affirmative, and immediately produced it for her approbation. On looking at it, her countenance grew crim&s;on with anger.
<PB N="177" REF="178">
"Did I not tell you," &s;aid &s;he, "not to put the Reverend upon it&mdash;only plain Mr. Cardigan?"</P>
<P>"It was my ma&s;ter," replied the man, "you &s;poke to, Madam; and he only told us to get ready a hand|&s;ome bra&s;s plate for the Reverend Mr. Cardigan; and we thought &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Your ma&s;ter is a fool then," in|terrupted &s;he, "to be &s;o ab&s;urd, when I gave him the rea&s;ons for it. Why, even the faculty &s;ay my poor dear Mr. Cardigan cannot live &s;ix months; and when he is gone, dear creature! what &s;hall I do with the Reverend? No no, I'll have only
<PB N="178" REF="179">
Mr. Cardigan; and then when he is dead, I can have the S added to Mr. with little expence."</P>
<P>"But then, Madam, &s;uppo&s;e, as the plate is now fini&s;hed, you took it as it is. The Reverend will certainly look more re&s;pectable; and you can but have the other when the poor gentleman is actually gone."</P>
<P>"Don't tell me," cried the lady, "I will have no &s;uch thing: your ma&s;ter would then expect me to pay for both; but now, as it is only his fault, he mu&s;t be an&s;werable for this, for I will have another my own way."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">The man bowed obedience, and the lady left the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Sir George could not conceal his &s;urpri&s;e at this extraordinary dia|logue; but, advancing, enquired who the lady was? The man replied, not without a &s;mile, "that &s;he was the wife of a clergyman, who, though in ill-health, had a good private for|tune, exclu&s;ive of his preferment which was con&s;iderable." Sir George was going to make an eulogium on her prudent foreca&s;t; but his friend, who had fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s, now returned, and taking his arm they left the &s;hop together. Our hero did not forget to relate the anecdote
<PB N="180" REF="181">
to Mr. Davenport, who laughed heartily at it; but added, "he had &s;een &s;imilar proofs of ridiculous economy, and in people who &s;crupled not throwing away hundreds in the pur|&s;uit of their plea&s;ures or the gra|tification of their vices."</P>
<P>The night before our hero left town, he had pa&s;&s;ed the evening at the Haymarket theatre, and was ju&s;t &s;tepping into a hackney coach, when the &s;creams of a female &s;truck his ears from an adjacent carriage. Ever ready to &s;uccour the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he bade the coachman drive to the end of the &s;treet, and wait for him there whil&s;t he endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="181" REF="182">
the lady. Making his way with &s;ome difficulty, he found the wheel of her chariot was locked with another; the &s;hock had thrown the man from his box, and the hor&s;es were plun|ging with &s;uch violence, that there was every rea&s;on to fear he was ma|terially injured. Whil&s;t the &s;ur|rounding multitude were endeavour|ing to di&s;entangle him, our hero open|ed the carriage door, and, taking out the lady, who was almo&s;t lifele&s;s with terror, bore her re&s;olutely and &s;afely through the crowd to the coach that waited his arrival. When &s;eated in that, &s;he recovered &s;ufficiently to re|ply to Sir George, on his reque&s;ting to know her addre&s;s: "Lord Mil|banke's,
<PB N="182" REF="183">
Portman-&s;quare." The name &s;truck him forcibly; but, concealing his emotions, he &s;aid nothing of his relation&s;hip, and began to imagine it might be a good opportunity of in|troducing him&s;elf to the brother of a parent who had been ever mo&s;t tenderly regretted by him. The lady now expre&s;&s;ed her deep &s;en&s;e of his polite attention, and Sir George in the u&s;ual complimentary &s;tyle declared, "he thought him&s;elf infinitely happy in having rendered her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance." A few mutually civil &s;peeches of this kind brought them to the hou&s;e, when the lady, on enquiring if Lord Milbanke was at home, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, de&s;ired
<PB N="183" REF="184">
our hero to walk up &s;tairs, that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of introdu|cing him to her Lord. He in&s;tantly complied, and was announced by her Lady&s;hip as a gentleman who had extricated her from a &s;ituation not merely di&s;agreeable but danger|ous.</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke, who was a man of fa&s;hionable manners and &s;triking ad|dre&s;s, received our hero with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s, and, having paid his acknowledgments, reque&s;ted to be informed to whom he was &s;o much obliged. Sir George, who at his fir&s;t entrance with difficulty concealed
<PB N="184" REF="185">
his agitation, which the &s;ight of his uncle and the &s;triking re&s;emblance he bore to his mother had excited, now found his embarra&s;&s;ment in|crea&s;e &s;o much, from a doubt of his reception when he confe&s;&s;ed his name, that he coloured and he&s;i|tated to a degree that might have given a &s;u&s;picious mind rea&s;on to be|lieve he had &s;ome motive for conceal|ing it: but Lord Milbanke, too open-hearted him&s;elf to &s;u&s;pect ano|ther of duplicity without good cau&s;e, would not ob&s;erve his chagrin; but, pouring out a gla&s;s of wine, and taking another him&s;elf, begged to have the honour of drinking our

<P>"I &s;carcely, my Lord, know how to an&s;wer you, le&s;t you &s;hould think me deficient both in duty and re&s;pect, in being indebted to an accident only for the plea&s;ure I now experience in an introduction to one who has from relation&s;hip a claim to every atten|tion from me, when I acknowledge my name is George Warrington."</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke's &s;urpri&s;e was ex|treme, but his &s;atisfaction was equal. He advanced, and, folding our hero in his arms, replied, "Do not, my dear
<PB N="186" REF="187">
nephew, apologize to me, who am my&s;elf only to blame. Your dear mother (and his eyes filled with tears) was my favourite &s;i&s;ter; but I was taught to believe, on my return from the Continent, that Sir Thomas had forbidden her all intercour&s;e with our family; and, engaged in con&s;tant di&s;|&s;ipation, I enquired no farther. But &s;ince the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth has given way to more &s;erious re|flection, I have often lamented the di&s;tance between us, and that the un|kind di&s;po&s;ition of your father to|wards us prevented all friendly in|tercour&s;e. On hearing of his death, I enquired for you of a gentleman in your neighbourhood who was then in
<PB N="187" REF="188">
town: the account he gave me was &s;o different from the truth, that I blu&s;h at ever having credited it. He told me you was a mere country '&s;quire, devoted to field &s;ports, and at once rough and unpoli&s;hed: that you boa&s;ted of per&s;i&s;ting in your fa|ther's political opinions, and inhe|rited all his di&s;like to courtiers in general, and your mother's family in particular. This of cour&s;e deterred me from &s;eeking your acquaintance, as I fancied it would afford neither of us any &s;atisfaction; but, convinced as I now am of my mi&s;take, I re|joice in the fortunate event that has made us known to each other."</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">Sir George expre&s;&s;ed equal plea|&s;ure, and regretted that, from his un|cle's mi&s;conception of his character, they had &s;o long been &s;trangers. Yet feeling that he had de&s;erved the de|&s;cription of his country neighbour, he coloured on the recollection, and continued: "Yet, my Lord, I know not, in fact, that I was mi&s;repre&s;ented to you, &s;ince, till within a few months, my ideas, my hopes, and my plea|&s;ures, were all centred in the &s;ports of the field. An accident then con|vinced me of the folly of placing my dependence on amu&s;ements which in the hours of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;olitude could afford me no relief; and I turned my mind to tho&s;e &s;tudies I had
<PB N="189" REF="190">
&s;o long neglected; and, when I reco|vered, re&s;olved to leave my retire|ment, cultivate a more general ac|quaintance, and endeavour to gain &s;ome knowledge of men and manners. Indeed I had thought of going abroad; but the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions in France determined me to give up this &s;cheme, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"You judged very prudently," replied Lord Milbanke; "and in all re&s;pects I applaud and approve your conduct. But where is the ru&s;ticity of manners I was taught to believe you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? Where the rough, unpoli&s;h|ed country '&s;quire, who gloried in his abhorrence of refinement? Why, Sir
<PB N="190" REF="191">
George, you will do me credit as your uncle in the fir&s;t circles in this kingdom, where I hope to have the honour of introducing you."</P>
<P>Our hero bowed his acknowledg|ments, but replied, "at pre&s;ent it would not be in his power to avail him&s;elf of the honour, as he had pro|mi&s;ed to return into the country the following day, but would certainly pay his re&s;pects to him again before he revi&s;ited Northumberland." Lord Milbanke accepted his excu&s;es, but in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;taying with them when next he came to London&mdash;which our hero &s;aid he &s;hould do in a few weeks.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">The &s;upper was now brought in, and a more general conver&s;ation en|&s;ued, in which Lady Milbanke bore a part. She expre&s;&s;ed infinite &s;ati&s;|faction at the reconciliation which had taken place through her means, and with much &s;weetne&s;s &s;aid, "&s;he hoped Sir George would be their fre|quent gue&s;t;" and in this wi&s;h his Lord&s;hip &s;incerely joined. Our hero had now an opportunity of ob&s;erving the countenances of his new-&s;ound relations, and contemplated them with much plea&s;ure. In Lord Mil|banke he &s;aw a &s;triking family-re|&s;emblance to his revered mother; the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;e and be|nevolence, with an air of blended dig|nity
<PB N="192" REF="193">
and fa&s;hion. But in Lady Mil|banke there was a &s;omething which &s;eemed to &s;trike on the chords of his heart; in her eyes a vivacity cha&s;|tened with mode&s;ty, in her cheeks the glow of health, and on her brow an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment which &s;eemed congenial to his own. She was not above five-and-thirty, and retained more of the bloom of youth than is u&s;ual at that period.</P>
<P>Sir George remained with them till a very late hour, and they parted with &s;incere regret; which however was le&s;&s;ened by his promi&s;e of re|turning to them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He did not &s;ee Mr. Davenport that
<PB N="193" REF="194">
night; but the next morning, when they got into the chai&s;e, he inform|ed him of the plea&s;ant event of the preceding evening, imagining he would participate in his &s;atisfaction: but he was mi&s;taken. Mr. Daven|port received the intelligence with much coldne&s;s, and was in fact &s;orry that our hero had found a relation in a man who was from principle as well as party an avowed enemy to the mea&s;ures of him&s;elf and friends; and, in a very ill-humour which he could &s;carcely conceal, he &s;et down our hero at Violet Hill, and, refu&s;ing Mr. Wilmot's entreaties to alight, proceeded to his own hou&s;e to dinner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is far from my intention to enter into a minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of po|litics, but merely to &s;hew the ill con|&s;equences ari&s;ing from mi&s;taken prin|ciples; in&s;tead of repeating all the arguments u&s;ed by Mr. Davenport to mi&s;lead our hero, I &s;hall only re|late the motives by which he was ac|tuated. He had been, on &s;ome occa|&s;ion not worth mentioning, oppo&s;ed with much warmth at a county meeting by a Mr. Anne&s;ley, a man of exten&s;ive property in the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="195" REF="196">
who had al&s;o &s;ome &s;hare in a very con&s;iderable manufacture. For this rea&s;on he had been marked out by Mr. Davenport, as one who if po&s;&s;ible &s;hould feel the fir&s;t marks of his re&s;entment, in the exertions made by him in his newly-taken-up character of a patriot; but, fearful of rendering him&s;elf obnoxious to the generality of his acquaintance, he contrived, with that deep artifice he was ma&s;ter of, to make Sir George his agent, and in fact had led him to do all he wi&s;hed without appearing in it him&s;elf. He at fir&s;t worked upon the feelings of our hero, by accom|panying him to the hovels where the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of the manufacturers
<PB N="196" REF="197">
re&s;ided, who&s;e poverty was occa|&s;ioned by their licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and re|pre&s;ented their mi&s;ery as cau&s;ed by the avarice of their ma&s;ter, who, though him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every luxury of life, denied them the com|mon nece&s;&s;aries. Sir George, not aware of the con&s;equences, but alive to the impul&s;e of humanity, incau|tiou&s;ly &s;poke of the wretchedne&s;s of their &s;ituation, and advi&s;ed them to demand an increa&s;e of wages. Idle|ne&s;s and extravagance in the lower cla&s;&s;es of life are &s;oon rou&s;ed to re|bellion: the &s;pirit of di&s;content per|vaded their bo&s;oms, and they endea|voured to &s;pread their principles among their hone&s;t and laborious
<PB N="197" REF="198">
brethren. But here they failed. In|du&s;try and virtue &s;eldom li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tions of vice. However, too many of them willingly attend|ed to his advice; and a party was formed &s;ufficiently &s;trong, which Sir George promi&s;ed to head, and en|deavour by remon&s;trances to prevail on Mr. Anne&s;ley to grant them the wi&s;hed-for addition to their wages. Our hero meant only to remon|&s;trate; but a lawle&s;s rabble is like a raging ocean, and none but a &s;uperior power can &s;ay, "Thus far &s;halt thou go, but no farther."</P>
<P>This plan was to have been exe|cuted a few days after his return
<PB N="198" REF="199">
from London; but the following morning he received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Davenport, to &s;ay Mr. Anne&s;ley was gone into the we&s;t of England, and would not be at home for &s;ome time: it was therefore nece&s;&s;arily de|ferred; and Sir George was now at lei&s;ure to follow his u&s;ual occupa|tions. Part of his time was devoted to his followers; repeating the good advice he had before given them, and accompanying it with tokens of his bounty &s;till more welcome. The re&s;t was given to Mr. Wilmot and his family.</P>
<P>The reception he met with on his return from the younger part of it
<PB N="199" REF="200">
was prettily varied. Myrtilla met him with a good-humoured &s;mile; Ro&s;etta, with a look of di&s;dainful dignity, intended to make him un|ea&s;y; and Fidelia, with an air of lan|gui&s;hing pen&s;ivene&s;s: &s;he would have blu&s;hed, if a blu&s;h would have ari&s;en at her command&mdash;but advancing to|wards him, &s;he hung her head, and trembled with tolerable effect: but on his in&s;en&s;ible heart it was all lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The next day at dinner, a new &s;tratagem was tried by the &s;i&s;ters; for Ro&s;etta and Fidelia had entered into an amicable agreement re&s;pecting our hero: next to their own intere&s;t with him, they agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other.
<PB N="200" REF="201">
In pur&s;uance of this plan, the latter with her u&s;ual gentlene&s;s rallied the former on &s;ome new conque&s;t &s;he had gained. Ro&s;etta's pretended di&s;tre&s;s was evident: &s;he coloured, bit her fan, and was in great agitation; but that agitation became real, when her &s;i&s;ter hinted that the gentleman had not been un&s;ucce&s;sful in his applica|tion. Here &s;he went far beyond her commi&s;&s;ion; but a rival is never to be tru&s;ted. Ro&s;etta only meant &s;he &s;hould awaken his feelings, not his jealou&s;y: but Fidelia had her own views in this, as &s;he wi&s;hed to con|vince him of her &s;i&s;ter's indifference. But it was now her turn to triumph: &s;he drew from her pocket a pa&s;toral
<PB N="201" REF="202">
elegy from Delia to Lycidas, that &s;he had picked up under the great oak in the park. This was to have been given to Sir George, with a hint that it was the fir&s;t effu&s;ion of Fidelia's virgin mu&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed to him; but Ro&s;etta &s;aid not a word, mali|ciou&s;ly hoping, and not without rea|&s;on, that he would condemn it as a &s;illy and ridiculous poem, and that &s;he &s;hould thus be amply revenged for her ba&s;e conduct.</P>
<P>Our hero, quite uncon&s;cious of the &s;nare, began to read it aloud with a mock gravity, imagining it was de&s;igned as a burle&s;que; but Myr|tilla, aware of the author, from
<PB N="202" REF="203">
having &s;een Fidelia walk up and down the great gallery by moonlight for two or three evenings, repeating to her&s;elf with unu&s;ual empha&s;is, now trembled for her feelings, and, though not without blu&s;hing for her folly, at once told Sir George who was the writer. Our hero, particu|larly concerned at the mi&s;take he had made, altered his tone gradually; and, when he had concluded, returned it to Fidelia, &s;aying in an embarra&s;&s;ed manner, that "whoever &s;he meant by Lycidas was too happy in being the object of her e&s;teem;" and then, unable to recover him&s;elf, made &s;ome &s;light excu&s;e, and quitted the room; leaving Fidelia fully convinced of
<PB N="203" REF="204">
his attachment, from his he&s;itation, which &s;he attributed to a &s;udden emotion of tender gratitude. Prid|ing her&s;elf on this, and not aware of Ro&s;etta's intentions, as totally un|con&s;cious that her elegy contained any thing ridiculous, &s;he began to di&s;play her mean triumph; when Ro&s;etta, who was previou&s;ly enraged, now expre&s;&s;ed all the bitterne&s;s &s;he had for &s;ome time concealed.</P>
<P>Myrtilla, who alone &s;aw things in a right point of view, was deeply concerned at her &s;i&s;ter's folly, but knew not how to act. Advice they &s;corned; reproof offended them; their mother was too indolent to exert
<PB N="204" REF="205">
her&s;elf properly; and &s;he feared that her father, who was a man of plain capacity, would not entirely under|&s;tand the&s;e feminine quarrels. At pre&s;ent, however, &s;he had nothing to do but to &s;eparate the angry combat|ants; and, having effected it with much difficulty, per&s;uaded them to retire to their chambers. She then &s;ought our hero, who was in the park ruminating on his peculiar &s;itu|ation, and was now for the fir&s;t time &s;en&s;ible of Fidelia's attachment, for &s;uch he really thought it; and began to con&s;ider how he could leave the hou&s;e without giving Mr. Wilmot the rea&s;ons. Whil&s;t debating this point, Myrtilla met him, and to her
<PB N="205" REF="206">
he mentioned his &s;u&s;picions. Mi&s;s Wilmot in reply a&s;&s;ured him "he need not be apprehen&s;ive of wound|ing the feelings of her &s;i&s;ter," and then gave him her real opinion on the &s;ubject; for, enraged at the mean|ne&s;s and duplicity of their conduct, &s;he thought her&s;elf ju&s;tified in re|vealing it. Surpri&s;e for a moment took place of every other emotion; for he was till now a &s;tranger to tho&s;e feminine arts which di&s;tingui&s;h the fair &s;ex, and very far from be|lieving him&s;elf an object of peculiar attention. He was now convinced there was no immediate nece&s;&s;ity for his quitting Violet Hill, at the &s;ame time determined to be as little there as
<PB N="206" REF="207">
po&s;&s;ible, till he could accompli&s;h his de&s;ign with re&s;pect to Mr. Anne&s;ley, which would depend on his return from the we&s;t. It therefore occurred to him that he might avail him&s;elf of that gentleman's ab&s;ence to pay a vi&s;it to Lord Milbanke; and accord|ingly that evening he wrote him a &s;hort letter to &s;ignify his intention of wait|ing on him in a week, as he had promi&s;ed the following morning to accompany the young ladies to the county town to &s;pend a few days with an uncle who re&s;ided there. This promi&s;e had been given before the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events of the after|noon, and he could not now recall it; though he felt very little plea|&s;ure
<PB N="207" REF="208">
in the idea of being con&s;idered as the attendant of Ro&s;etta and Fi|delia, for Mi&s;s Wilmot was detained at home by the expectation of com|pany. The evening pa&s;&s;ed off awk|wardly enough; and the next day at ten o'clock he mounted his hor&s;e, and e&s;corted his fair companions to D&mdash;.</P>
<P>The following morning was Sun|day, and he accompanied the family to church; and Mr. James Wilmot's pew not being large enough to ac|commodate the whole party, Fidelia and him&s;elf were &s;hewn into another. The &s;ervice was ju&s;t begun; and the &s;eat before them being empty, our
<PB N="208" REF="209">
hero having no book, Fidelia gave him one &s;he had ju&s;t taken from it: but what were his emotions, when, accidentally opening the fir&s;t page, he &s;aw the name of Loui&s;a Moreland! The extreme agitation he &s;uffered hurt him the more, as it convinced him the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on his heart her &s;ub&s;equent conduct had not been able wholly to &s;ubdue. It was not unnoticed by Fidelia, who enquiring the cau&s;e, he &s;hewed her the book; but the attention of both was &s;uddenly called from that by the door of the next &s;eat being opened by the &s;exton, and three girls entered, the elde&s;t about twelve years old, followed by Mi&s;s More|land
<PB N="209" REF="210">
her&s;elf. The additional glow on the cheek of our hero immedi|ately informed Fidelia of the truth, and &s;he endeavoured, but in vain, to draw his eyes from her. A few mo|ments reflection, however, effected what &s;he could not; he fixed his thoughts on Loui&s;a's late behaviour, and became calm enough to re&s;tore her prayer-book, which &s;he was then looking for. She had not turn|ed her head &s;ince her entrance; but, on taking the book with a &s;light curt|&s;ey, &s;he caught his eye, and, in&s;tantly recollecting him, coloured deeply; and her emotion became vi&s;ible even to the children, who, pulling her by the cloak, a&s;ked what was the mat|ter.
<PB N="210" REF="211">
She replied in a low whi&s;per, and immediately &s;at down. Her agitation increa&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s of Sir George, and Fidelia was racked with a thou|&s;and fears le&s;t the bewitching coun|tenance of Loui&s;a (for bewitching even her rival allowed it to be) &s;hould obliterate from the mind of our hero the remembrance of her depravity.</P>
<Q><L>If to her &s;hare &s;ome female errors fall,</L>
<L>Look on her face, and you'll forget them all.</L></Q>
<P>Fidelia was aware of this, and de|termined that if po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould not look on her face any more; and indeed, to his honour be it &s;poken,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
he had made the &s;ame determina|tion.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was ended, Fi|delia opened the door, and begged him to follow her; but at the &s;ame moment Mi&s;s Moreland leaned over the pew, and reque&s;ted he would give her leave to &s;peak to him for a few minutes. Sir George bowed coldly, and made no reply; but Fi|delia, dreading the con&s;equences of an interview, an&s;wered with a haugh|tine&s;s &s;he could occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;ume, "that the gentleman was in ha&s;te, and mu&s;t not be detained." Our hero had no time to he&s;itate, as &s;he &s;eized his arm, and begged they might
<PB N="212" REF="213">
leave the church before the generality of people moved.</P>
<P>When arrived at home, &s;he called her uncle into another room, who, &s;oon re|turning, a&s;ked Sir George to accompa|ny him in a walk; which he gladly a&s;|&s;ented to, happy in being relieved from the Mi&s;s Wilmots, who&s;e &s;ociety wea|ried and di&s;plea&s;ed him. The day in general pa&s;&s;ed off heavily enough, and the following not much better. Our hero was di&s;turbed by the beau|tiful image of Loui&s;a, which &s;till haunted him; and he wi&s;hed to en|quire re&s;pecting her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, but dared not; as he knew it would draw on him reproofs he was but too
<PB N="213" REF="214">
con&s;cious of de&s;erving. Tue&s;day was fixed for their return; and he re|traced with particular &s;atisfaction the road that led to Violet Hill.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the family were all a&s;&s;embled, the conver&s;ation turning on the manner of their pa&s;&s;|ing their time at D&mdash;, Fidelia, with much &s;olemnity in her voice and manner, addre&s;&s;ed our hero:</P>
<P>"I &s;hould perhaps, Sir George, feel &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment at relating a circum&s;tance I have too much rea&s;on to fear will give you pain, did not my con&s;cience tell me I have acted from the be&s;t and noble&s;t mo|tives,
<PB N="214" REF="215">
and have exerted my&s;elf in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, at the expence of all my benevolent feelings and a cruel wound to my &s;en&s;ibility. Of Mi&s;s Moreland's guilt you can have no doubt; yet I &s;aw her pre&s;ence di&s;tre&s;&s;ed you extremely. On en|quiry I learned &s;he had been lately engaged as a governe&s;s by Mrs. Edgeworth of Bellmour Hall, about a mile and a half from D&mdash;; and, con&s;ulting both my aunt and &s;i&s;ter, we were unitedly of opinion that a woman capable of acting as &s;he has done was entirely unfit to form either the minds or morals of young people; and that it would be right to inform Mrs. Edgeworth whom &s;he
<PB N="215" REF="216">
had in her hou&s;e, and leave her to act as &s;he thought proper. In con|&s;equence of this determination, whil&s;t you were walking with my uncle, Ro&s;etta and my&s;elf &s;et out and called on that lady. We found her at home; and, after apologizing for the &s;tep we were about to take, enquired by what means Mi&s;s Moreland had gained an a&s;ylum with her; and learned from the reply, &s;he had im|po&s;ed on them by a &s;tory &s;imilar to that &s;he related to you. I then men|tioned every particular of her conduct at Warrington, where I &s;aid &s;he had gone in con&s;equence of your bene|volence. Mrs. Edgeworth was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and her hu&s;band enraged;
<PB N="216" REF="217">
the latter declaring &s;he &s;hould not &s;leep another night under his roof. As a corroboration of what I a&s;&s;ert|ed, Mrs. Edgeworth, though evi|dently concerned (for I perceived the girl has had art enough to ingratiate her&s;elf with mo&s;t of the family), ac|knowledged '&s;he came home that morning extremely ill; and the chil|dren, being called in, declared to the &s;ame effect; that &s;he was &s;o much agitated during the &s;ervice, they were greatly alarmed; and that, after the gentleman refu&s;ed to &s;peak to her, &s;he was &s;o ill they thought &s;he would have fainted in the carriage as they came along.' This confirmed the truth of my &s;tory; and Mr. Edge|worth
<PB N="217" REF="218">
&s;aid, '&s;he &s;hould quit his hou&s;e directly.' I a&s;&s;ured them, if they cho&s;e to make an application to you, we would accompany them back to my uncle's with plea&s;ure; but this they politely declined, &s;aying, 'they had no doubt of our veracity, as we could be induced by no motive but a wi&s;h for their welfare.' I then begged your name might not be men|tioned to Loui&s;a, as I thought you would not feel happy in the idea of being known as the means of de|priving her of their protection, and had rather it &s;hould be concealed. This they promi&s;ed; and, in the even|ing, I received a note from Mrs. Edgeworth to inform us that Mi&s;s
<PB N="218" REF="219">
Moreland had left their hou&s;e. And now, Sir George, tell me, have I not acted properly?"</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot both join|ed in prai&s;ing the &s;pirit &s;he had &s;hewn; and Sir George could not deny the ju&s;tice of her conduct: at the &s;ame time he reprobated the motives; for he well knew both Ro&s;etta and Fi|delia were more &s;trongly impelled by jealou&s;y than any other cau&s;e. The &s;ame idea &s;truck Mi&s;s Wilmot, but &s;he did not choo&s;e to reveal it; and the following morning, our hero, heartily tired of the whole family but Myrtilla, took a friendly leave of her, and &s;et out for Lord Milbanke's;
<PB N="219" REF="220">
where arriving &s;ome days earlier than he had intended, he was an unexpect|ed but not an unwelcome gue&s;t.</P>
