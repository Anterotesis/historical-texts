<HEAD>THE HACKNEY COACHMAN; OR, The Way to get a good Fare.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>I AM a bold Coachman and drive a good Hack,</L>
<L>With a coat of five capes that quite covers my back;</L>
<L>And my wife keeps a &s;au&s;age-&s;hop not many miles</L>
<L>From the narrowe&s;t alley in all Broad St. Giles.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
Tho' poor we are hone&s;t and very content,</L>
<L>We pay as we go for meat, drink, and for rent;</L>
<L>To work all the week I am able and willing,</L>
<L>I never get drunk, and I wa&s;te not a &s;hilling.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>What tho' at a tavern my gentleman tarries,</L>
<L>Why the coachman grows richer than he whom he carries;</L>
<L>And I'd rather (&s;ay I) &s;ince it &s;aves me from &s;in,</L>
<L>Be the Driver without than the Toper within.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>For the dram-&s;hop I hate and the dram-drinking friend,</L>
<L>Yet I'm not quite &s;o good but I wi&s;h I may mend;</L>
<L>I repent of my &s;ins &s;ince we all are deprav'd,</L>
<L>For a Coachman, I hold, has a &s;oul to be &s;av'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>When a riotous multitude fills up a &s;treet,</L>
<L>And the greater part know not, boys, wherefore they meet;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
If I &s;ee there is mi&s;chief I never go there,</L>
<L>Let others get tip&s;y, &s;o I get my fare.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Now to church if I take &s;ome good lady to pray,</L>
<L>It grieves me full &s;ore to be kept quite away;</L>
<L>So I &s;tep thro' the door-way, for here 'tis the &s;in,</L>
<L>To loiter without when one might enter in.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Then my gla&s;&s;es are whole, and my coach is &s;o neat,</L>
<L>I am always the fir&s;t to be call'd in the &s;treet;</L>
<L>And I'm known by the name ('tis a name rather rare)</L>
<L>Of the Coachman that never a&s;ks more than his fare.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' my bea&s;ts &s;hould be dull yet I don't u&s;e them ill;</L>
<L>Tho' they &s;tumble I &s;wear not, nor cut them up hill;</L>
<L>For I firmly believe there's no charm in an oath</L>
<L>That can make a Nag trot when to walk he is loth.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>And tho' I'm a Coachman, I'll freely confe&s;s,</L>
<L>I beg of my Maker my labors to ble&s;s;</L>
<L>I prai&s;e him each morning, and pray every night,</L>
<L>And 'tis this makes my heart feel &s;o cheerful and light.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>When I drive to a Fun'ral I care not for drink,</L>
<L>That is not the moment to guzzle, but think;</L>
<L>And I wi&s;h I cou'd add both of Coachman and Ma&s;ter,</L>
<L>That both of us &s;trove to amend a bit fa&s;ter.</L>
