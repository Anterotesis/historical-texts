<HEAD>TO The Reverend Mr. Hume, Author of DOUGLAS, a Tragedy.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was the practice of the an|tients to addre&s;s their compo&s;itions only to friends and equals, and to ren|der their dedications monuments of regard and affection, not of &s;ervility and flattery. In tho&s;e days of inge|nuous and candid liberty, a dedication did honour to the per&s;on to whom it
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
was addre&s;&s;ed, without degrading the author. If any partiality appeared to|wards the patron, it was at lea&s;t the partiality of friend&s;hip and affection.</P>
<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance of true liberty, of which antient times can alone af|ford us an example, is the liberty of thought, which engaged men of let|ters, however different in their ab|&s;tract opinions, to maintain a mutual friend&s;hip and regard; and never to quarrel about principles, while they agreed in inclinations and manners. Science was often the &s;ubject of di&s;pu|tation, never of animo&s;ity. <HI>Cicero,</HI> an academic, addre&s;&s;ed his philo&s;ophical treati&s;es, &s;ometimes to <HI>Brutus,</HI> a &s;toic; &s;ometimes to <HI>Atticus,</HI> an epicurean.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="6">
I HAVE been &s;eized with a &s;trong de|&s;ire of renewing the&s;e laudable prac|tices of antiquity, by addre&s;&s;ing the following di&s;&s;ertations to you, my good friend: For &s;uch I will ever call and e&s;teem you, notwith&s;tanding the op|po&s;ition, which prevails between us, with regard to many of our &s;peculative tenets. The&s;e differences of opinion I have only found to enliven our con|ver&s;ation; while our common pa&s;&s;ion for &s;cience and letters &s;erved as a ce|ment to our friend&s;hip. I &s;till admired your genius, even when I imagined, that you lay under the influence of pre|judice; and you &s;ometimes told me, that you excu&s;ed my errors, on account of the candor and &s;incerity, which, you thought, accompanied them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="7">
BUT to tell truth, it is le&s;s my ad|miration of your fine genius, which has engaged me to make this addre&s;s to you, than my e&s;teem of your character and my affection to your per&s;on.

<P>I own too, that I have the ambition to be the fir&s;t who &s;hall in public ex|pre&s;s his admiration of your noble tra|gedy of DOUGLAS; one of the mo&s;t

intere&s;ting and pathetic pieces, that was ever exhibited on any theatre.

But the un|feigned tears which flowed from every eye, in the numerous repre&s;entations which were made of it on this theatre; the unparalleled command, which you appeared to have over every af|fection of the human brea&s;t: The&s;e are inconte&s;tible proofs, that you po&s;|&s;e&s;s the true theatric genius of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>

<P>MY enemies, you know, and, I own, even &s;ometimes my friends, have reproached me with the love of paradoxes and &s;ingular opinions; and I expect to be expo&s;ed to the &s;ame im|putation, on account of the character, which I have here given of your DOUGLAS.

<HEAD>DISSERTATION I. The Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS every enquiry, which regards Religion, is of the utmo&s;t importance, there are two que&s;tions in particular, which challenge our principal attention, to wit, that concerning it's foundation in rea&s;on, and that concerning its origin in human nature. Happily, the fir&s;t que&s;tion, which is the mo&s;t important, admits of the mo&s;t obvious, at lea&s;t, the cleare&s;t &s;olu|tion. The whole frame of nature be&s;peaks an intelligent author; and no rational enquirer can, after &s;erious reflexion, &s;u&s;pend his belief a mo|ment with regard to the primary principles of genuine Thei&s;m and Religion. But the other que&s;tion, concerning the origin of religion in human nature, admits of &s;ome more difficulty. The belief of invi&s;ible, intelligent power has been very generally diffu&s;ed over the human race, in all places and in all ages; but it has neither perhaps been &s;o univer&s;al as to admit of no ex|ceptions,
<PB N="2" REF="13">
nor has it been, in any degree, uni|form in the ideas, which it has &s;ugge&s;ted. Some nations have been di&s;covered, who entertained no &s;entiments of Religion, if travellers and hi|&s;torians may be credited; and no two nations, and &s;carce any two men, have ever agreed pre|ci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;entiments. It would appear, therefore, that this preconception &s;prings not from an original in&s;tinct or primary impre&s;&s;ion of nature, &s;uch as gives ri&s;e to &s;elf-love, affecti|on betwixt the &s;exes, love of progeny, grati|tude, re&s;entment; &s;ince every in&s;tinct of this kind has been found ab&s;olutely univer&s;al in all nations and ages, and has always a preci&s;e, de|terminate object, which it inflexibly pur&s;ues. The fir&s;t religious principles mu&s;t be &s;econdary; &s;uch as may ea&s;ily be perverted by various acci|dents and cau&s;es, and who&s;e operation too, in &s;ome ca&s;es, may, by an extraordinary concur|rence of circum&s;tances, be altogether prevent|ed. What tho&s;e principles are, which give ri&s;e to the original belief, and what tho&s;e acci|dents and cau&s;es are, which direct its operation, is the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="3" REF="14">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears to me, that if we con&s;ider the improvement of human &s;ociety, from rude beginnings to a &s;tate of greater perfection, po|lythei&s;m or idolatry was, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have been, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t antient religion of mankind. This opinion I &s;hall endeavour to confirm by the following arguments.</P>
<P>'TIS a matter of fact unconte&s;table, that about 1700 years ago all mankind were idolaters. The doubtful and &s;ceptical principles of a few philo&s;ophers, or the thei&s;m, and that too not entirely pure, of one or two nations, form no objection worth regarding. Behold then the clear te&s;timony of hi&s;tory. The farther we mount up into antiquity, the more do we find mankind plunged into idolatry. No marks, no &s;ymptoms of any more perfect religion. The mo&s;t antient records of human race &s;till pre&s;ent us with polythei&s;m as the popular and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem. The north, the &s;outh, the ea&s;t, the we&s;t, give their unanimous te&s;timony to the &s;ame fact. What can be oppo&s;ed to &s;o full an evidence?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15">
As far as writing or hi&s;tory reaches, man|kind, in antient times, appear univer&s;ally to have been polythei&s;ts. Shall we a&s;&s;ert, that, in more antient times, before the knowledge of letters, or the di&s;covery of any art or &s;cience, men entertained the principles of pure thei&s;m? That is, while they were ignorant and barba|rous, they di&s;covered truth: But fell into error, as &s;oon as they acquired learning and polite|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT in this a&s;&s;ertion you not only contradict all appearance of probability, but al&s;o our pre|&s;ent experience concerning the principles and opinions of barbarous nations. The &s;avage tribes of <HI>America, Africa,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are all ido|laters. Not a &s;ingle exception to this rule. In&s;omuch, that, were a traveller to tran&s;port him&s;elf into any unknown region; if he found inhabitants cultivated with arts and &s;ciences, tho' even upon that &s;uppo&s;ition there are odds again&s;t their being thei&s;ts, yet could he not&s;afely, till farther enquiry, pronounce any thing on that head: But if he found them ignorant and barbarous, he might beforehand declare them idolaters; and there &s;carce is a po&s;&s;ibility of his being mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="16">
IT &s;eems certain, that, according to the natu|ral progre&s;s of human thought, the ignorant multitude mu&s;t fir&s;t entertain &s;ome groveling and familiar notion of &s;uperior powers, before they &s;tretch their conception to that perfect be|ing, who be&s;towed order on the whole frame of nature. We may as rea&s;onably imagine, that men inhabited palaces before huts and cot|tages, or &s;tudied geometry before agriculture; as a&s;&s;ert that the deity appeared to them a pure &s;pirit, omni&s;cient, omnipotent, and omnipre|&s;ent, before he was apprehended to be a power|ful, tho' limited being, with human pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, limbs and organs. The mind ri&s;es gradually, from inferior to &s;uperior: By ab|&s;tracting from what is imperfect, it forms an idea of perfection: And &s;lowly di&s;tingui&s;hing the nobler parts of its frame from the gro&s;&s;er, it learns to transfer only the former, much ele|vated and refined, to its divinity. Nothing could di&s;turb this natural progre&s;s of thought, but &s;ome obvious and invincible argument, which might immediately lead the mind into the pure principles of thei&s;m, and make it over|leap, at one bound, the va&s;t interval, which is interpo&s;ed betwixt the human and the divine na|ture.
<PB N="6" REF="17">
But tho' I allow, that the order and frame of the univer&s;e, when accurately examin|ed, affords &s;uch an argument; yet I can never think that this con&s;ideration could have an influ|ence on manking, when they formed their fir&s;t, rude notions of religion.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of objects, which are quite fami|liar to us, never &s;trike our attention or curio&s;ity; and however extraordinary or &s;urprizing the&s;e objects may be in them&s;elves, they are pa&s;t over, by the raw and ignorant multitude, without much examination or enquiry. <HI>Adam,</HI> ri&s;ing at once, in paradi&s;e, and in the full perfection of his faculties, would naturally, as repre&s;ented by <HI>Milton,</HI> be a&s;toni&s;hed at the glorious appear|ances of nature, the heavens, the air, the earth, his own organs and members; and would be led to a&s;k, whence this wonderful &s;cene aro&s;e. But a barbarous, nece&s;&s;itous animal (&s;uch as man is on the fir&s;t origin of &s;ociety) pre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch numerous wants and pa&s;&s;ions, has no lei&s;ure to admire the regular face of na|ture, or make enquiries concerning the cau&s;e of objects, to which, from his infancy, he has been gradually accu&s;tomed. On the contrary, the more regular and uniform, that is, the more
<PB N="7" REF="18">
perfect, nature appears, the more is he fami|liarized to it, and the le&s;s inclined to &s;crutinize and examine it. A mon&s;trous birth excites his curio&s;ity, and is deemed a prodigy. It alarms him from its novelty; and immediately &s;ets him a trembling, and &s;acrificing, and praying. But an animal compleat in all its limbs and or|gans, is to him an ordinary &s;pectacle, and pro|duces no religious opinion or affection. A&s;k him, whence that animal aro&s;e; he will tell you, from the copulation of its parents. And the&s;e, whence? From the copulation of theirs. A few removes &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity, and &s;ets the objects at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that he entirely lo&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of them. Imagine not, that he will &s;o much as &s;tart the que&s;tion, whence the fir&s;t ani|mal; much le&s;s, whence the whole &s;y&s;tem or united fabric of the univer&s;e aro&s;e. Or, if you &s;tart &s;uch a que&s;tion to him, expect not, that he will employ his mind with any anxiety about a &s;ubject, &s;o remote, &s;o unintere&s;ting, and which &s;o much exceeds the bounds of his capa|city.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if men were at fir&s;t led into the belief of one &s;upreme being, by rea&s;oning from the frame of nature, they could never po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="8" REF="19">
leave that belief, in order to embrace idolatry; but the &s;ame principles of rea&s;oning, which at fir&s;t produced, and diffu&s;ed over mankind, &s;o magnificent an opinion, mu&s;t be able, with greater facility, to pre&s;erve it. The fir&s;t inven|tion and proof of any doctrine is infinitely more difficult than the &s;upporting and retaining it.</P>
<P>THERE is a great difference betwixt hi&s;torical facts and &s;peculative opinions; nor is the know|ledge of the one propagated in the &s;ame manner with that of the other. An hi&s;torical fact, while it pa&s;&s;es by oral tradition from eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es and contemporaries, is di&s;gui&s;ed in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive narration, and may at la&s;t retain but very &s;mall, if any, re&s;emblance of the original truth, on which it was founded. The frail memories of men, their love of exaggeration, their &s;upine carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; the&s;e principles, if not corrected by books and writing, &s;oon per|vert the account of hi&s;torical events; where ar|gument or rea&s;oning has little or no place, nor can ever recal the truth, which has once e&s;cap|ed tho&s;e narrations. 'Tis thus the fables of <HI>Hercules, The&s;eus, Bacchus</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally founded in true hi&s;tory, cor|rupted by tradition. But with regard to &s;pecu|lative
<PB N="9" REF="20">
opinions, the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. If the&s;e opinions be founded in arguments &s;o clear and obvious as to carry conviction with the ge|nerality of mankind, the &s;ame arguments, which at fir&s;t diffu&s;ed the opinions, will &s;till pre&s;erve them in their original purity. If the arguments be more ab&s;tru&s;e, and more remote from vulgar apprehen&s;ions, the opinions will always be confined to a few per&s;ons; and as &s;oon as men leave the contemplation of the ar|guments, the opinions will immediately be lo&s;t and buried in oblivion. Which ever &s;ide of this dilemma we take, it mu&s;t appear impo&s;&s;ible, that thei&s;m could, from rea&s;oning, have been the primary religion of human race, and have afterwards, by its corruption, given birth to ido|latry and to all the various &s;uper&s;titions of the heathen world. Rea&s;on, when very obvious, prevents the&s;e corruptions: When ab&s;tru&s;e, it keeps the principles entirely from the knowledge of the vulgar, who are alone liable to corrupt any principles, or opinions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="21">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>IF we would, therefore, indulge our curio|&s;ity, in enquiring concerning the origin of reli|gion, we mu&s;t turn our thoughts towards ido|latry or polythei&s;m, the primitive Religion of unin&s;tructed mankind.</P>
<P>WERE men led into the apprehen&s;ion of in|vi&s;ible, intelligent power by a contemplation of the works of nature, they could never po&s;&s;ibly entertain any conception but of one &s;ingle be|ing, who be&s;towed exi&s;tence and order on this va&s;t machine, and adju&s;ted all its parts, ac|cording to one regular plan or connected &s;y&s;tem. For tho', to per&s;ons of a certain turn of mind, it may not appear altogether ab&s;urd, that &s;eve|ral independent beings, endowed with &s;uperior wi&s;dom, might con&s;pire in the contrivance and execution of one regular plan; yet is this a mere arbitrary &s;uppo&s;ition, which, even if al|lowed po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed neither to be &s;upported by probability nor nece&s;&s;ity. All things in the univer&s;e are evidently of a piece. Every thing is adju&s;ted to every thing. One
<PB N="11" REF="22">
de&s;ign prevails thro' the whole. And this uniformity leads the mind to acknowledge one author; becau&s;e the conception of different au|thors, without any di&s;tinction of attributes or operations, &s;erves only to give perplexity to the imagination, without be&s;towing any &s;atisfaction on the under&s;tanding<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The &s;tatue of <HI>Laocoon,</HI> as we learn from <HI>Pliny,</HI> was the work of three arti&s;ts: But 'tis certain, that, were we not told &s;o, we &s;hould never have concluded, that a groupe of figures, cut from one &s;tone, and united in one plan, was not the work and contrivance of one &s;tatuary To a&s;cribe any &s;ingle effect to the combination of &s;everal cau&s;es, is not &s;urely a natural and obvi|ous &s;uppo&s;ition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if, leaving the works of nature, we trace the foot&s;teps of invi&s;ible pow|er in the various and contrary events of human life, we are nece&s;&s;arily led into polythei&s;m, and to the acknowledgment of &s;everal limited and imperfect deities. Storms and tempe&s;ts ruin what is nouri&s;hed by the &s;un. The &s;un de|&s;troys what is fo&s;tered by the moi&s;ture of dews and rains. War may be favourable to a na|tion, whom the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons af|flicts with famine. Sickne&s;s and pe&s;tilence may depopulate a kingdom, amid&s;t the mo&s;t profu&s;e plenty. The &s;ame nation is not, at the
<PB N="12" REF="23">
&s;ame time, equally &s;ucce&s;sful by &s;ea and by land. And a nation, which now triumphs over its enemies, may anon &s;ubmit to their more pro&s;|perous arms. In &s;hort, the conduct of events or what we call the plan of a particular provi|dence, is &s;o full of variety and uncertainty, that, if we &s;uppo&s;e it immediately ordered by any in|telligent beings, we mu&s;t acknowledge a con|trariety in their de&s;igns and intentions, a con|&s;tant combat of oppo&s;ite powers, and a repen|tance or change of intention in the &s;ame power, from impotence or levity. Each nation has its tutelar deity. Each element is &s;ubjected to its invi&s;ible power or agent. The province of each god is &s;eparate from that of another. Nor are the operations of the &s;ame god always cer|tain and invariable. To day, he protects: To morrow, he abandons us. Prayers and &s;acrifi|ces, rites and ceremonies, well or ill perform|ed, are the &s;ources of his favour or enmity, and produce all the good or ill fortune, which are to be found among&s;t mankind.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in all nations, which have embraced polythei&s;m or idolatry, the fir&s;t ideas of religion aro&s;e not from a contemplation of the works of nature,
<PB N="13" REF="24">
but from a concern with regard to the events of life, and from the ince&s;&s;ant hopes and fears, which actuate the human mind. Accordingly, we find, that all idolaters, having &s;eparated the provinces of their deities, have recour&s;e to that invi&s;ible agent, to who&s;e authority they are im|mediately &s;ubjected, and who&s;e province it is to &s;uperintend that cour&s;e of actions, in which they are, at any time, engaged. <HI>Juno</HI> is in|voked at marriages; <HI>Lucina</HI> at births. <HI>Nep|tune</HI> receives the prayers of &s;eamen; and <HI>Mars</HI> of warriors. The hu&s;bandman cultivates his field under the protection of <HI>Ceres;</HI> and the merchant acknowledges the authority of <HI>Mer|cury.</HI> Each natural event is &s;uppo&s;ed to be go|verned by &s;ome intelligent agent; and nothing pro&s;perous or adver&s;e can happen in life, which may not be the &s;ubject of peculiar prayers or thank&s;givings<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fragilis et laborio&s;a mortalitas in partes i&s;ta dige&s;&s;it, infirmi|tatis &s;uae memor, ut portionibus qui&s;quis eoleret, quo maxime in|digeret.</HI> Plin. lib. ii. cap. 7.

IT mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, indeed, be allowed, that, in order to carry men's attention be|yond the vi&s;ible cour&s;e of things, or lead them into any inference concerning invi&s;ible intelli|gent power, they mu&s;t be actuated by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, which prompts their thought and reflection; &s;ome motive, which urges their fir&s;t enquiry. But what pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall we here have recour&s;e to, for explaining an effect of &s;uch mighty con&s;equence? Not &s;pecula|tive curio&s;ity &s;urely, or the pure love of truth.

<P>WE are placed in this world, as in a great theatre, where the true &s;prings and cau&s;es of every event, are entirely unknown to us; nor have we either &s;ufficient wi&s;dom to fore&s;ee, or power to prevent tho&s;e ills, with which we are continually threatened. We hang in per|petual &s;u&s;pen&s;e betwixt life and death, health and &s;ickne&s;s, plenty and want; which are di&s;tri|buted among&s;t the human &s;pecies by &s;ecret and unknown cau&s;es, who&s;e operation is oft unex|pected, and always unaccountable. The&s;e <HI>un|known cau&s;es,</HI> then, become the con&s;tant ob|ject of our hope and fear; and while the pa&s;|&s;ions are kept in perpetual alarm by an anxious expectation of the events, the imagination is equally employed in forming ideas of tho&s;e powers, on which we have &s;o entire a depen|dance. Could men anatomize nature, accord|ing to the mo&s;t probable, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t in|telligible philo&s;ophy, they would find, that the&s;e cau&s;es are nothing but the particular fabric and &s;tructure of the minute parts of their own bodies and of external objects; and that, by a regular and con&s;tant machinery, all the events are pro|duced,
<PB N="17" REF="28">
about which they are &s;o much concerned. But this philo&s;ophy exceeds the comprehen&s;ion of the ignorant multitude, who can only con|ceive the <HI>unknown cau&s;es</HI> in a general and con|fu&s;ed manner; tho' their imagination, perpe|tually employed on the &s;ame &s;ubject, mu&s;t la|bour to form &s;ome particular and di&s;tinct idea of them. The more they con&s;ider the&s;e cau&s;es them&s;elves, and the uncertainty of their opera|tion, the le&s;s &s;atisfaction do they meet with in their re&s;earch; and, however unwilling, they mu&s;t at la&s;t have abandoned &s;o arduous an at|tempt, were it not for a propen&s;ity in human nature, which leads into a &s;y&s;tem, that gives them &s;ome &s;eeming &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE is an univer&s;al tendency among&s;t mankind to conceive all beings like them&s;elves, and to transfer to every object tho&s;e qualities, with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately con&s;cious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural propen&s;ity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, a&s;cribe malice and good-will to every thing, that hurts or plea&s;es us. Hence the frequency and beauty of the <HI>pro&s;opopoeia</HI> in poetry, where trees,
<PB N="18" REF="29">
mountains and &s;treams are per&s;oni&s;ied, and the inanimate parts of nature acquire &s;entiment and pa&s;&s;ion. And tho' the&s;e poetical figures and expre&s;&s;ions gain not on the belief, they may &s;erve, at lea&s;t, to prove a certain tendency in the imagination, without which they could nei|ther be beautiful nor natural. Nor is a river|god or hama-dryad always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary per&s;onage; but may &s;ome|times enter into the real creed of the ignorant vulgar; while each grove or field is repre&s;ented as po&s;&s;e&s;t of a particular <HI>genius</HI> or invi&s;ible power, which inhabits and protects it. Nay, philo&s;o|phers cannot entirely exempt them&s;elves from this natural frailty; but have oft a&s;cribed to in|animate matter the horror of a <HI>vacuum,</HI> &s;ym|pathies, antipathies, and other affections of human nature. The ab&s;urdity is not le&s;s, while we ca&s;t our eyes upwards; and transfer|ring, as is too u&s;ual, human pa&s;&s;ions and infirmi|ties to the deity, repre&s;ent him as jealous and revengeful, capricious and partial, and, in &s;hort, a wicked and fooli&s;h man in every re&s;pect, but his &s;uperior power and authority. No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in &s;uch an ab&s;olute ignorance of cau&s;es, and being at the &s;ame time &s;o anxious concerning their future
<PB N="19" REF="30">
fortunes, &s;hould immediatly acknowledge a de|pendence on invi&s;ible powers, po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;enti|ment and intelligence. The <HI>unknown cau&s;es,</HI> which continually employ their thought, appear|ing always in the &s;ame a&s;pect, are all appre|hended to be of the &s;ame kind or &s;pecies. Nor is it long before we a&s;cribe to them thought, and rea&s;on, and pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a re&s;emblance with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN proportion as any man's cour&s;e of life is governed by accident, we always find, that he encrea&s;es in &s;uper&s;tition; as may particularly be ob&s;erved of game&s;ters and &s;ailors, who, tho', of all mankind, the lea&s;t capable of &s;erious me|ditation, abound mo&s;t in frivolous and &s;uper&s;ti|tious apprehen&s;ions.

ANY of the human affections may lead us into the notion of invi&s;ible, intelligent power; hope as well as fear, gratitude as well as afflic|tion: But if we examine our own hearts, or ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;es around us, we &s;hall find, that men are much o&s;tener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>THE only point of theology, in which we &s;hall find a con&s;ent of mankind almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al, is, that there is invi&s;ible, intelligent power in the world: But whether this power be &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate, whether confined to one being or di&s;tributed among&s;t &s;everal, what attributes, qualities, connexions or principles of action ought to be a&s;cribed to tho&s;e beings; concerning all the&s;e points, there is the wide&s;t difference in the popular &s;y&s;tems of theology. Our ance&s;tors in <HI>Europe,</HI> before the revival of let|ters, believed, as we do at pre&s;ent, that there was one &s;upreme God, the author of nature, who&s;e power, tho', in it&s;elf, uncontrolable, yet was often exerted by the interpo&s;ition of his angels and &s;ubordinate mini&s;ters, who executed his &s;acred purpo&s;es. But they al&s;o believed, that all nature was full of other invi&s;ible powers; fairies, goblins, elves, &s;prights; beings, &s;tronger and mightier than men, but much inferior to the cele&s;tial natures, who &s;urround the throne of God. Now &s;uppo&s;e, that any one, in tho&s;e ages, had denied the exi&s;tence of God and of his angels; would not his impiety ju&s;tly have
<PB N="25" REF="36">
de&s;erved the appellation of athei&s;m, even tho' he had &s;till allowed, by &s;ome odd capricious rea&s;oning, that the popular &s;tories of elves and fairies were ju&s;t and well-grounded? The dif|ference, on the one hand, betwixt &s;uch a per&s;on and a genuine thei&s;t is infinitely greater, than that, on the other, betwixt him and one, that ab&s;olutely excludes all invi&s;ible, intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely from the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of names, without any con|formity of meaning, to rank &s;uch oppo&s;ite opini|ons under the &s;ame denomination.</P>
<P>TO any one, who con&s;iders ju&s;tly of the matter, it will appear, that the gods of all polythei&s;ts or idolaters are no better than the elves or fairies of our ance&s;tors, and merit as little any pious wor&s;hip or veneration. The&s;e pretended religioni&s;ts are really a kind of &s;uper|&s;titious athei&s;ts, and acknowledge no being, that corre&s;ponds to our idea of a deity.

<P>BUT it is chiefly our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider the gro&s;s polythei&s;m and idolatry of the vulgar, and to trace all its various appear|ances, in the principles of human nature, whence they are derived.</P>
<P>WHOEVER learns, by argument, the exi&s;t|ence of invi&s;ible, intelligent power, mu&s;t rea&s;on from the admirable contrivance of natural ob|jects, and mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the world to be the workman&s;hip of that divine being, the original cau&s;e of all things. But the vulgar polythei&s;t, &s;o far from admitting that idea, deifies every part of the univer&s;e, and conceives all the con|&s;picuous productions of nature to be them&s;elves &s;o many real divinities. The fun, moon, and &s;tars are all gods, according to his &s;y&s;tem: Fountains are inhabited by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become &s;acred in his eyes, and &s;trike him with a religious veneration. And thus, however &s;trong men's propen&s;ity to be|lieve invi&s;ible, intelligent power in nature, their propen&s;ity is equally &s;trong to re&s;t their
<PB N="36" REF="47">
attention on &s;en&s;ible, vi&s;ible objects; and in order to reconcile the&s;e oppo&s;ite inclinations, they are led to unite the invi&s;ible power with &s;ome vi&s;ible object.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tribution al&s;o of di&s;tinct provinces to the &s;everal deities is apt to cau&s;e &s;ome allegory, both phy&s;ical and moral, to enter into the vulgar &s;y&s;tems of polythei&s;m. The god of war will naturally be repre&s;ented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The god of poetry as elegant, polite, and amiable: The god of merchandi&s;e, e&s;pecially in early times, as thievi&s;h and deceit|ful. The allegories, &s;uppo&s;ed in <HI>Homer</HI> and other mythologi&s;ts, I allow, have been often &s;o &s;trained, that men of &s;en&s;e are apt entirely to reject them, and to con&s;ider them as the pro|duct merely of the fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But that allegory really has place in the heathen mythology is unde|niable even on the lea&s;t reflection. <HI>Cupid</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Venus;</HI> the Mu&s;es the daughters of memory; <HI>Prometheus</HI> the wi&s;e brother, and <HI>Epimetheus</HI> the fooli&s;h; <HI>Hygieia</HI> or the godde&s;s of health de&s;cended from <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> or the god of phy&s;ic: Who &s;ees not, in the&s;e, and in many other in&s;tances, the plain traces of alle|gory?

When a god is &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over any pa&s;&s;ion, event, or &s;y&s;tem of actions; it is almo&s;t unavoidable to give him a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, &s;uitable to his &s;up|po&s;ed powers and influence; and to carry on that &s;imilitude and compari&s;on, which is natu|rally &s;o agreeable to the mind of man.</P>

<P>THE doctrine of one &s;upreme deity, the author of nature, is very antient, has &s;pread it|&s;elf over great and populous nations, and among them has been embraced by all ranks and con|dition of per&s;ons: But whoever thinks that it has owed its &s;ucce&s;s to the prevalent force of tho&s;e invincible rea&s;ons, on which it is undoubt|edly founded, would &s;how him&s;elf little ac|quainted with the ignorance and &s;tupidity of the people, and their incurable prejudices in favour of their particular &s;uper&s;titions. Even at this day, and in <HI>Europe,</HI> a&s;k any of the vulgar, why he believes in an omnipotent creator of the world; he will never mention the beauty of final cau&s;es, of which he is wholly ignorant: He will not hold out his hand, and bid you con|template the &s;upplene&s;s and variety of joints in his fingers, their bending all one way, the coun|terpoi&s;e which they receive from the thumb, the &s;oftne&s;s and fle&s;hy parts of the in&s;ide of his hand, with all the other circum&s;tances, which render that member fit for the u&s;e, to which it was de&s;tined. To the&s;e he has been long accu|&s;tomed; and he beholds them with li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="43" REF="54">
and unconcern. He will tell you of the &s;udden and unexpected death of &s;uch a one: The fall and brui&s;e of &s;uch another: The exce&s;&s;ive drought of this &s;ea&s;on: The cold and rains of another. The&s;e he a&s;cribes to the immediate operation of providence: And &s;uch events, as, with good rea&s;oners, are the chief difficulties in admitting a &s;upreme intelligence, are with him the &s;ole arguments for it.</P>
<P>MANY thei&s;ts, even the mo&s;t zealous and refined, have denied a <HI>particular</HI> providence, and have a&s;&s;erted, that the Sovereign mind or fir&s;t principle of all things, having fixt general laws, by which nature is governed, gives free and uninterrupted cour&s;e to the&s;e laws, and di|&s;turbs not, at every turn, the &s;ettled order of events, by particular volitions. From the beau|tiful connexion, &s;ay they, and rigid ob&s;ervance of e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, we draw the chief argument for thei&s;m; and from the &s;ame principles are enabled to an&s;wer the principal objections again&s;t it. But &s;o little is this under&s;tood by the gene|rality of mankind, that, wherever they ob&s;erve any one to a&s;cribe all events to natural cau&s;es, and to remove the particular interpo&s;al of a deity, they are apt to &s;u&s;pect him of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t infi|delity.

<HI>A little philo&s;ophy,</HI> &s;ays my Lord <HI>Bacon, makes men athei&s;ts: A great deal reconciles them to religion.</HI> For men, being taught, by &s;uper|&s;titious prejudices, to lay the &s;tre&s;s on a wrong place; when that fails them, and they di&s;cover, by a little reflection, that the cour&s;e of nature is regular and uniform, their whole faith totters, and falls to ruin. But being taught, by more reflection, that this very regularity and unifor|mity is the &s;tronge&s;t proof of de&s;ign and of a &s;upreme intelligence, they return to that belief, which they had de&s;erted; and they are now able to e&s;tabli&s;h it on a firmer and more durable foundation.</P>

WE may conclude, therefore, upon the whole, that &s;ince the vulgar, in nations, which have embraced the doctrine of thei&s;m, &s;till build it upon irrational and &s;uper&s;titious opinions, they are never led into that opinion by any proce&s;s of argument, but by a certain train of thinking, more &s;uitable to their genius and capacity.</P>
<P>IT may readily happen, in an idolatrous na|tion, that, tho' men admit the exi&s;tence of &s;e|veral limited deities, yet may there be &s;ome one god, whom, in a particular manner, they make the object of their wor&s;hip and adoration. They may either &s;uppo&s;e, that, in the di&s;tribu|tion of power and territory among the gods, their nation was &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of that particular deity; or reducing heavenly ob|jects to the model of things below, they may repre&s;ent one god as the prince or &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate of the re&s;t, who, tho' of the &s;ame nature, rules them with an authority, like that which an earthly &s;overeign exerci&s;es over his &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als. Whether this god, therefore, be con&s;idered as their peculiar patron, or as the general &s;overeign of heaven, his votaries will endeavour, by every act, to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into his favour; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be plea&s;ed,

like them&s;elves, with prai&s;e and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration, which will be &s;pared in their addre&s;&s;es to him. In proportion as men's fears or di&s;tre&s;&s;es become more urgent, they &s;till invent new &s;trains of adulation; and even he who out-does his predece&s;&s;ors, in &s;wel|ling up the titles of his divinity, is &s;ure to be out-done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in newer and more pompous epithets of prai&s;e. Thus they pro|ceed; till at la&s;t they arrive at infinity it&s;elf, beyond which there is no farther progre&s;s: And it is well, if, in &s;triving to get farther, and to repre&s;ent a magnificent &s;implicity, they run not into inexplicable my&s;tery, and de&s;troy the intelligent nature of their deity; on which alone any rational wor&s;hip or adoration can be founded. While they confine them&s;elves to the notion of a perfect being, the crea|tor of the world, they coincide, by chance, with the principles of rea&s;on and true philo&s;o|phy; tho' they are guided to that notion, not by rea&s;on, of which they are in a great mea&s;ure incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the mo&s;t vulgar &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

How much more natu|ral, therefore, is it, that a limited deity, who at fir&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed only the immediate author of the particular goods and ills in life, &s;hould in the end be repre&s;ented as &s;overeign maker and modifier of the univer&s;e?</P>

<P>IT is remarkable, that the principles of re|ligion have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural ten|dency to ri&s;e from idolatry to thei&s;m, and to &s;ink again from thei&s;m into idolatry. The vul|gar, that is, indeed, all mankind, a few ex|cepted, being ignorant and unin&s;tructed, never elevate their contemplation to the heavens, or penetrate by their di&s;qui&s;itions into the &s;ecret &s;tructure of vegetable or animal bodies; &s;o as to di&s;cover a &s;upreme mind or original provi|dence, which be&s;towed order on every part of nature. They con&s;ider the&s;e admirable works in a more confined and &s;elfi&s;h view; and find|ing their own happine&s;s and mi&s;ery to depend on the &s;ecret influence and unfore&s;een concur|rence of external objects, they regard, with per|petual attention, the <HI>unknown cau&s;es,</HI> which go|vern all the&s;e natural events, and di&s;tribute plea|&s;ure and pain, good and ill, by their powerful, but &s;ilent, operation. The unknown cau&s;es are &s;till appealed to, at every emergence; and in this general appearance or confu&s;ed image, are the perpetual objects of human hopes and
<PB N="55" REF="66">
fears, wi&s;hes and apprehen&s;ions. By degrees, the active imagination of men, unea&s;y in this ab&s;tract conception of objects, about which it is ince&s;&s;antly employed, begins to render them more particular, and to cloathe them in &s;hapes more &s;uitable to its natural comprehen&s;ion. It repre&s;ents them to be &s;en&s;ible, intelligent beings, like mankind; actuated by love and hatred, and flexible by gifts and entreaties, by prayers and &s;acrifices. Hence the origin of religion: And hence the origin of idolatry or polythei&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ame anxious concern for happine&s;s, which engenders the idea of the&s;e invi&s;ible, intelligent powers, allows not mankind to re|main long in the fir&s;t &s;imple conception of them; as powerful, but limited beings; ma&s;ters of human fate, but &s;laves to de&s;tiny and the cour&s;e of nature. Men's exaggerated prai&s;es and com|pliments &s;till &s;well their idea upon them; and elevating their deities to the utmo&s;t bounds of perfection, at la&s;t beget the attributes of unity and infinity, &s;implicity and &s;pirituality. Such refined ideas, being &s;omewhat di&s;proportioned to vulgar comprehen&s;ion, remain not long in their original purity; but require to be &s;up|ported by the notion of inferior mediators or
<PB N="56" REF="67">
&s;ubordinate agents, which interpo&s;e betwixt mankind and their &s;upreme deity. The&s;e demi-gods or middle beings, partaking more of human nature, and being more familiar to us, become the chief objects of devotion, and gradually recal that idolatry, which had been formerly bani&s;hed by the ardent prayers and pa|negyrics of timorous and indigent mortals. But as the&s;e idolatrous religions fall every day into gro&s;&s;er and more vulgar conceptions, they at la&s;t de&s;troy them&s;elves, and, by the vile repre|&s;entations, which they form of their deities, make the tide turn again towards thei&s;m. But &s;o great is the propen&s;ity, in this alternate revo|lution of human &s;entiments, to return back to idolatry, that the utmo&s;t precaution is not able effectually to prevent it. And of this, &s;ome thei&s;ts, particularly the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> have been &s;en&s;ible; as appears by their bani&s;h|ing all the arts of &s;tatuary and painting, and not allowing the repre&s;entations, even of human figures, to be taken by marble or colours; le&s;t the common infirmity of mankind &s;hould thence produce idolatry. The feeble apprehen&s;ions of men cannot be &s;atisfied with conceiving their deity as a pure &s;pirit and perfect intelligence; and yet their natural terrors keep them from

imputing to him the lea&s;t &s;hadow of limitation and imperfection. They fluctuate betwixt the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;entiments. The &s;ame infirmity &s;till drags them downwards, from an omnipotent and &s;piritual deity to a limited and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited deity to a &s;tatue or vi&s;ible repre&s;entation. The &s;ame endeavour at elevation &s;till pu&s;hes them upwards, from the &s;tatue or material image to the invi|&s;ible power; and from the invi&s;ible power to an infinitely perfect deity, the creator and &s;o|vereign of the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>POLYTHEISM or idolatrous wor&s;hip, being founded entirely in vulgar traditions, is liable to this great inconvenience, that any practice or opinion, however barbarous or corrupted, may be authorized by it; and full &s;cope is left for knavery to impo&s;e on credulity, till morals and humanity be expelled from the religious &s;y&s;tems of mankind. At the &s;ame time, idola|try is attended with this evident advantage, that, by limiting the powers and functions of its dei|ties, it naturally admits the gods of other &s;ects and nations to a &s;hare of divinity, and renders all the various deities, as well as rites, cere|monies, or traditions, compatible with each other<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Verrius Flaccus,</HI> cited by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxviii. cap. 2. af|firmed, that it was u&s;ual for the <HI>Romans,</HI> before they laid &s;iege to any town, to invocate the tutelar deity of the place, and by promi&s;ing him equal or greater honours than tho&s;e he at pre&s;ent enjoyed, bribe him to betray his old friends and votaries.

and di&s;advantages.

The&s;e mighty advantages are not indeed over|ballanced, (for that is not po&s;&s;ible) but &s;ome|what dimini&s;hed, by inconveniencies, which, ari&s;e from the vices and prejudices of mankind. While one &s;ole object of devotion is acknow|ledged, the wor&s;hip of other deities is regarded as ab&s;urd and impious. Nay, this unity of ob|ject &s;eems naturally to require the unity of faith and ceremonies, and furni&s;hes de&s;igning men with a pretext for repre&s;enting their adver&s;aries as prophane, and the &s;ubjects of divine as well as human vengeance. For as each &s;ect is po&s;i|tive, that its own faith and wor&s;hip are entirely acceptable to the deity, and as no one can con|ceive, that the &s;ame being &s;hould be plea&s;ed with different and oppo&s;ite rites and principles; the &s;everal &s;ects fall naturally into animo&s;ity,

<P>THE tolerating &s;pirit of idolaters both in an|tient and modern times, is very obvious to any one, who is the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in the writings of hi&s;torians or travellers. When the oracle of <HI>Delphi</HI> was a&s;ked, what rites or wor&s;hip were mo&s;t acceptable to the gods? Tho&s;e legally e&s;tabli&s;hed in each city, replied the oracle<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Xenoph. Memor. lib. ii.</NOTE>. Even prie&s;ts, in tho&s;e ages, could, it &s;eems, allow &s;alvation to tho&s;e of a different communion. The <HI>Romans</HI> commonly adopted the gods of the conquered people; and never di&s;puted the attri|butes of tho&s;e topical and national deities, in who&s;e territories they re&s;ided. The religious wars and per&s;ecutions of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> idolaters are indeed an exception to this rule; but are accounted for by antient authors from rea&s;ons very &s;ingular and remarkable. Different &s;pecies of animals were the deities of the different &s;ects of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> and the deities being in con|tinual war, engaged their votaries in the &s;ame contention.

<P>THE intolerance of almo&s;t all religions, which have maintained the unity of god, is as remarkable as the contrary principle in poly|thei&s;ts.

<P>FROM the compari&s;on of thei&s;m and ido|latry, we may form &s;ome other ob&s;ervations, which will al&s;o confirm the vulgar ob&s;ervation, that the corruption of the be&s;t things gives ri&s;e to the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>WHERE the deity is repre&s;ented as infinitely &s;uperior to mankind, this belief, tho' altogether ju&s;t, is apt, when joined with &s;uper&s;titious ter|rors, to &s;ink the human mind into the lowe&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and aba&s;ement, and to repre&s;ent the monki&s;h virtues of mortification, pennance, hu|mility and pa&s;&s;ive &s;uffering, as the only quali|ties, which are acceptable to him. But where the gods are conceived to be only a little &s;upe|rior to mankind, and to have been, many of them, advanced from that inferior rank, we are more at our ea&s;e in our addre&s;&s;es to them, and may even, without profanene&s;s, a&s;pire &s;ome|times to a rival&s;hip and emulation of them.

<P>HERE is another ob&s;ervation to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and a new proof that the corruption of the be&s;t things begets the wor&s;t. If we exa|mine, without prejudice, the antient heathen mythology, as contained in the poets, we &s;hall not di&s;cover in it any &s;uch mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity, as we may be apt at fir&s;t to apprehend. Where is the difficulty of conceiving, that the &s;ame powers or principles, whatever they were, which formed this vi&s;ible world, men and animals, produced al&s;o a &s;pecies of intelligent creatures, of more refined &s;ub&s;tance and greater authority than the re&s;t? That the&s;e creatures may be ca|pricious, revengeful, pa&s;&s;ionate, voluptuous, is ea&s;ily conceived; nor is any circum&s;tance more apt, among&s;t our&s;elves, to engender &s;uch vices, than the licence of ab&s;olute authority. And in &s;hort, the whole mythological &s;y&s;tem is &s;o na|tural, that, in the va&s;t variety of planets and worlds, contained in this univer&s;e, it &s;eems more than probable, that, &s;omewhere or other, it is really carried into execution.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80">
THE chief objection to it with regard to this planet, is, that it is not a&s;certained by any ju&s;t rea&s;on or authority. The antient tradition, in|&s;i&s;ted on by the heathen prie&s;ts and theologers, is but a weak foundation; and tran&s;mitted al&s;o &s;uch a number of contradictory reports, &s;upport|ed, all of them, by equal authority, that it be|came ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to fix a preference among&s;t them. A few volumes, therefore, mu&s;t contain all the polemical writings of pagan prie&s;ts. And their whole theology mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t more of traditional &s;tories and &s;uper&s;titious prac|tices than of philo&s;ophical argument and con|trover&s;y.</P>
<P>BUT where thei&s;m forms the fundamental principle of any popular religion, that tenet is &s;o conformable to &s;ound rea&s;on, that philo&s;ophy is apt to incorporate it&s;elf with &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of theology. And if the other dogmas of that &s;y&s;tem be contained in a &s;acred book, &s;uch as the Alcoran, or be determined by any vi&s;ible authority, like that of the Roman pontif, &s;pe|culative rea&s;oners naturally carry on their a&s;&s;ent, and embrace a theory, which has been in&s;tilled into them by their earlie&s;t education, and which al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome degree of con&s;i&s;tence and
<PB N="70" REF="81">
uniformity. But as the&s;e appearances do often, all of them, prove deceitful, philo&s;ophy will &s;oon find her&s;elf very unequally yoaked with her new a&s;&s;ociate; and in&s;tead of regulating each principle, as they advance together, &s;he is at every turn perverted to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition. For be&s;ides the unavoidable incoherencies, which mu&s;t be reconciled and adju&s;ted; one may &s;afely affirm, that all po|pular theology, e&s;pecially the &s;chola&s;tic, has a kind of appetite for ab&s;urdity and contradiction. If that theology went not beyond rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, her doctrines would appear too ea&s;y and familiar. Amazement mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity be rai&s;ed: My&s;tery affected: Darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity &s;ought after: And a foundation of me|rit afforded the devout votaries, who de&s;ire an opportunity of &s;ubduing their rebellious rea&s;on, by the belief of the mo&s;t unintelligible &s;ophi&s;ms.</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL hi&s;tory &s;ufficiently confirms the&s;e reflections. When a controver&s;y is &s;tarted, &s;ome people pretend always with certainty to conjecture the i&s;&s;ue. Which ever opinion, &s;ay they, is mo&s;t contrary to plain &s;en&s;e is &s;ure to prevail; even where the general intere&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem requires not that deci&s;ion. Tho' the

<P>IF ever there was a nation or a time, in which the public religion lo&s;t all authority over mankind, we might expect, that infidelity in <HI>Rome,</HI> during the <HI>Ciceronian</HI> age, would openly have erected its throne, and that <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf, in every &s;peech and action, would have been its mo&s;t declared abettor.

Even in his own family, and to his wife, <HI>Terentia,</HI> whom he highly tru&s;ted, he
<PB N="82" REF="93">
was willing to appear a devout religioni&s;t; and there remains a letter, addre&s;t to her, in which he &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ires her to offer &s;acrifice to <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> in gratitude for the reco|very of his health<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. xiv. epi&s;t. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>POMPEY'S devotion was much more &s;incere: In all his conduct, during the civil wars, he paid a great regard to auguries, dreams, and prophe&s;ies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cicero de Divin. lib. ii. c. 24.</NOTE>. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was tainted with &s;uper|&s;tition of every kind.

In &s;hort, it cannot be doubted, but the votaries of the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uper&s;tition of antiquity were as numerous in every &s;tate, as tho&s;e of the modern religion are at pre&s;ent.

<P>WE may ob&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding the dogmatical, imperious &s;tyle of all &s;uper&s;tition, the conviction of the religioni&s;ts, in all ages, is more affected than real, and &s;carce ever ap|proaches, in any degree, to that &s;olid belief and per&s;ua&s;ion, which governs us in the common affairs of life. Men dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts, which they enter|tain on &s;uch &s;ubjects: They make a merit of implicite faith; and di&s;gui&s;e to them&s;elves their real infidelity, by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;everations and mo&s;t po&s;itive bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and &s;uffers not the ob|&s;cure, glimmering light, afforded in tho&s;e &s;ha|dowy regions, to equal the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, made by common &s;en&s;e and by experience. The u&s;ual cour&s;e of men's conduct belies their words and &s;hows, that the a&s;&s;ent in the&s;e mat|ters is &s;ome unaccountable operation of the mind betwixt di&s;belief and conviction, but ap|proaching much nearer the former than the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="95">
SINCE, therefore, the mind of man appears of &s;o loo&s;e and un&s;teddy a contexture, that, even at pre&s;ent, when &s;o many per&s;ons find an inter|e&s;t in continually employing on it the chi&s;&s;el and the hammer, yet are they not able to en|grave theological tenets with any la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion; how much more mu&s;t this have been the ca&s;e in antient times, when the retainers to the holy function were &s;o much fewer in compa|ri&s;on? No wonder, that the appearances were then very incon&s;i&s;tent, and that men, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, might &s;eem determined infidels, and enemies to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, without being &s;o in reality; or at lea&s;t, without know|ing their own minds in that particular.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e, which rendered the antient religions much loo&s;er than the modern, is, that the former were <HI>traditional</HI> and the latter are <HI>&s;criptural;</HI> and the tradition in the former was complex, contradictory, and, on many occa&s;ions, doubtful; &s;o that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be re|duced to any &s;tandard and canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith. The &s;tories of the gods were numberle&s;s like the popi&s;h legends; and tho' every one, almo&s;t, believed a part of the&s;e &s;tories, yet no one could believe or know
<PB N="85" REF="96">
the whole: While, at the &s;ame time, all mu&s;t have acknowledged, that no one part &s;tood on a better foundation than the re&s;t. The traditions of different cities and nations were al&s;o, on many occa&s;ions, directly oppo&s;ite; and no rea&s;on could be found for preferring one to the other. And as there was an infinite number of &s;tories, with regard to which tradition was no way po&s;itive; the gradation was in&s;en&s;ible, from the mo&s;t fun|damental articles of faith, to tho&s;e loo&s;e and precarious fictions. The pagan religion, there|fore, &s;eemed to vani&s;h like a cloud, whenever one approached to it, and examined it piece|meal. It could never be a&s;certained by any fixt dogmas and principles. And tho' this did not convert the generality of mankind from &s;o ab|&s;urd a faith; for when will the people be rea|&s;onable? yet it made them faulter and he&s;itate more in maintaining their principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain di&s;po&s;itions of mind, &s;ome practices and opinions, which had the appearance of determined infidelity.</P>
<P>To which we may add, that the fables of the pagan religion were, of them&s;elves, light, ea&s;y, and familiar; without devils or &s;eas of brim|&s;tone, or any objects, that could much terrify
<PB N="86" REF="97">
the imagination. Who could forbear &s;miling, when he thought of the loves of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> or the amorous frolics of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Pan?</HI> In this re&s;pect, it was a true poetical reli|gion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has been adopted by modern bards; nor have the&s;e talked with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods, whom they regarded as fictions, than the antient did of the real objects of their devotion.</P>
<P>THE inference is by no means ju&s;t, that, be|cau&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of religion has made no deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on the minds of a people, it mu&s;t there|fore have been po&s;itively rejected by all men of common &s;en&s;e, and that oppo&s;ite principles, in &s;pite of the prejudices of education, were gene|rally e&s;tabli&s;hed by argument and rea&s;oning. I know not, but a contrary inference may be more probable. The le&s;s importunate and a&s;&s;um|ing any &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition appears, the le&s;s will it provoke men's &s;pleen and indignation, or engage them into enquiries concerning its foun|dation and origin. This in the mean time is obvious, that the empire of all religious faith over the under&s;tanding is wavering and

uncertain, &s;ubject to all varieties of humour, and dependent on the pre&s;ent incidents, which &s;trike the imagination. The difference is only in the degrees.

<P>THE primary religion of mankind ari&s;es chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of in|vi&s;ible, unknown powers, while men lie under di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of any kind, may ea&s;ily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, &s;eve|rity, cruelty, and malice mu&s;t occur and aug|ment the gha&s;tline&s;s and horror, which oppre&s;&s;es the amazed religioni&s;t. A panic having once &s;eized the mind, the active fancy &s;till farther multiplies the objects of terror; while that pro|found darkne&s;s, or, what is wor&s;e, that glim|mering light, with which we are invironed, re|pre&s;ents the &s;pectres of divinity under the mo&s;t dreadful appearances imaginable. And no idea of perver&s;e wickedne&s;s can be framed, which tho&s;e terrified devotees do not readily, without &s;cruple, apply to their deity.</P>
<P>THIS appears the natural &s;tate of religion, when &s;urveyed in one light. But if we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that &s;pirit of prai&s;e and eu|logy, which nece&s;&s;arily has place in all religions, and which is the con&s;equence of the&s;e very
<PB N="95" REF="106" MS="y">
terrors, we mu&s;t expect a quite contrary &s;y&s;tem of theology to prevail. Every virtue, every ex|cellence mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the divinity, and no exaggeration be e&s;teemed &s;ufficient to reach tho&s;e perfections, with which he is endowed. Whatever &s;trains of panegyric can be invented, are immediately embraced, without con&s;ulting any arguments or phaenomena. And it is e&s;teemed a &s;ufficient confirmation of them, that they give us more magnificent ideas of the divine object of our wor&s;hip and adoration.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is a kind of contradiction be|twixt the different principles of human nature, which enter into religion. Our natural terrors pre&s;ent the notion of a devili&s;h and malicious deity: Our propen&s;ity to prai&s;e leads us to ac|knowledge an excellent and divine. And the influence of the&s;e oppo&s;ite principles are vari|ous, according to the different &s;ituation of the human under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN very barbarous and ignorant nations, &s;uch as the <HI>Africans and Indians,</HI> nay even the <HI>Ja|pone&s;e,</HI> who can form no exten&s;ive ideas of power and knowledge, wor&s;hip may be paid to a being, whom they confe&s;s to be wicked and de|te&s;table;

<P>SUCH rude, imperfect ideas of the divinity ad|here long to all idolaters; and it may &s;afely be affirmed, that the <HI>Greeks</HI> them&s;elves never got entirely rid of them.

But as this was a &s;train of phi|lo&s;ophy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It was con&s;idered among the antients, as a very extraordi|nary, philo&s;ophical paradox, that the pre&s;ence of the gods was not confined to the heavens, but was extended every where; as we learn from <HI>Lucian.

<PB N="97" REF="108">
others, the mo&s;t &s;uitable to a mean and devili&s;h nature. The pagan hymns however, &s;ung in public wor&s;hip, contained nothing but epithets of prai&s;e; even while the actions a&s;cribed to the gods were the mo&s;t barbarous and dete&s;table. When <HI>Timotheus,</HI> the poet, recited a hymn to <HI>Diana,</HI> where he enumerated, with the greate&s;t eulogies, all the actions and attributes of that cruel, capricious godde&s;s: <HI>May your daughter,</HI> &s;aid one pre&s;ent, <HI>become &s;uch as the deity whom you celebrate</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plutarch. de Super&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as men farther exalt their idea of their divinity; it is often their notion of his power and knowledge only, not of his goodne&s;s, which is improved. On the contrary, in pro|portion to the &s;uppo&s;ed extent of his &s;cience and authority, their terrors naturally augment; while they believe, that no &s;ecrecy can conceal them from his &s;crutiny, and that even the inmo&s;t rece&s;|&s;es of their brea&s;t lie open before him. They mu&s;t then be careful not to form expre&s;sly any &s;entiment of blame and di&s;approbation. All mu&s;t be applau&s;e, ravi&s;hment, extacy. And while their gloomy apprehen&s;ions make them

a&s;cribe to him mea&s;ures of conduct, which, in human creatures, would be highly blamed, they mu&s;t &s;till affect to prai&s;e and admire the&s;e mea|&s;ures in the object of their devotional addre&s;&s;es. And thus it may &s;afely be affirmed, that many popular religions are really, in the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a &s;pecies of dae|moni&s;m; and the higher the deity is exalted in power and knowledge, the lower of cour&s;e is he frequently depre&s;t in goodne&s;s and benevo|lence; whatever epithets of prai&s;e may be be|&s;towed on him by his amazed adorers. Among&s;t idolaters, the words may be fal&s;e, and belie the &s;ecret opinion: But among&s;t more exalted religioni&s;ts, the opinion it&s;elf often contracts a kind of fal&s;hood, and belies the inward &s;enti|ment. The heart &s;ecretly dete&s;ts &s;uch mea|&s;ures of cruel and implacable vengeance; but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable. And the additional mi|&s;ery of this inward &s;truggle aggravates all the other terrors, by which the&s;e unhappy victims to &s;uper&s;tition are for ever haunted.</P>

<P>But in order to &s;how more evidently, that it is po&s;&s;ible for a religion to repre&s;ent the divinity in &s;till a more immoral unamiable light than the antient, we &s;hall cite a long pa&s;&s;age from an author of ta&s;te and imagination, who was &s;urely no enemy to Chri&s;tianity. It is the chevalier <HI>Ram&s;ay,</HI> a writer, who had &s;o laudable an incli|nation to be orthodox, that his rea&s;on never found any difficulty, even in the doctrines which freethinkers &s;cruple the mo&s;t, the trinity, incarnation, and &s;atisfaction: His humanity alone, of which he &s;eems to have had a great &s;tock, rebelled again&s;t the doctrines of eternal reprobation and prede&s;tination. He expre&s;|&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What &s;trange ideas, &s;ays he, would an Indian or a Chine&s;e philo&s;opher have of our holy religion, if they judged by the &s;chemes given of it by our modern freethinkers, and phari&s;aical doctors of all &s;ects? According to the odious and too <HI>vulgar</HI> &s;y&s;tem of the&s;e incredulous &s;coffers and credulous &s;criblers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The God of the Jews is a mo&s;t cruel, unju&s;t, par|tial and fanta&s;tical being. He created, about 6000 years ago, a man and a woman, and placed them in a fine garden of A&s;ia, of which there are no remains. This garden was furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of trees, fountains, and flowers. He allowed them the u&s;e of all the fruits of this beautiful garden, except of one, that was planted in the mid&s;t thereof, and that had in it a &s;ecret virtue of pre&s;erving them in continual health and vigor of body and mind, of exalting their natural powers and making them wi&s;e. The devil entered into the body of a &s;erpent, and &s;olicited the fir&s;t woman to eat of this forbidden fruit; &s;he engaged her hu&s;band to do the &s;ame. To puni&s;h this &s;light curio&s;ity and natural de&s;ire of life and know|ledge, God not only threw our fir&s;t parents out of paradi&s;e, but he condemned all their po&s;terity to temporal mi&s;ery, and the greate&s;t part of them to eternal pains, tho' the &s;ouls of the&s;e innocent children have no more relation to that of Adam than to tho&s;e of Nero and Mahomet; &s;ince, according to the &s;chola&s;tic drivellers, fabuli&s;ts, and mythologi&s;ts, all &s;ouls are created pure, and infu&s;ed immediately into mortal bodies, &s;o &s;oon as the foetus is formed. To accompli&s;h the barbarous, partial decree of prede&s;tination and reprobation, God aban|doned all nations to darkne&s;s, idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, with|out any &s;aving knowledge or &s;alutary graces; unle&s;s it was one particular nation, whom he cho&s;e as his peculiar people. This cho&s;en nation was, however, the mo&s;t &s;tupid, ungrateful, rebellious, and perfidious of all nations. After God had thus kept the far greater part of all the human &s;pecies, during near 4000 years, in a reprobate &s;tate, he changed all of a &s;udden, and took a fancy for other nations, be&s;ide the Jews. Then he &s;ent his only begotten Son to the world, under a human form, to appea&s;e his wrath, &s;atisfy his vindictive ju|&s;tice, and die for the pardon of &s;in. Very few nations, how|ever, have heard of this go&s;pel; and all the re&s;t, tho' left in invincible ignorance, are damned without exception or any po&s;&s;ibility of remi&s;&s;ion. The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e, who have heard of it, have changed only &s;ome &s;peculative notions about God, and &s;ome external forms in wor&s;hip: For, in other re&s;pects, the bulk of Chri&s;tians have continued as cor|rupt, as the re&s;t of mankind in their morals; yea, &s;o much the more perver&s;e and criminal, that their lights were greater. Unle&s;s it be a very &s;mall &s;elect number, all other Chri&s;tians, like the pagans, will be for ever damned; the great &s;acrifice of|fered up for them will become void and of no effect. God will take delight for ever in their torments and bla&s;phemies; and tho' he can, by one <HI>fiat,</HI> change their hearts, yet they will remain for ever unconverted and unconvertible, becau&s;e he will be for ever unappea&s;eable and irreconcileable. It is true, that all this makes God odious, a hater of &s;ouls, rather than a lover of them; a cruel, vindictive tyrant, an impotent or a wrathful daemon, rather than an all-powerful, beneficent Fa|ther of &s;pirits: Yet all this is a my&s;tery. He has &s;ecret rea|&s;ons for his conduct, that are impenetrable; and tho' he ap|pears unju&s;t and barbarous; yet we mu&s;t believe the contrary, becau&s;e what is inju&s;tice, crime, cruelty, and the blacke&s;t malice in us, is in him ju&s;tice, mercy, and &s;overeign goodne&s;s."</Q> Thus the incredulous freethinkers, the judaizing Chri&s;tians, and the fatali&s;tic doctors, have disfigured and di&s;honoured the &s;ublime my&s;teries of our holy faith; thus, they have confounded the nature of good and evil; transformed the mo&s;t mon&s;trous pa&s;&s;ions into divine attributes, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the pagans in bla&s;phemy, by

<P>HERE I cannot forbear ob&s;erving a fact, which may be worth the attention of tho&s;e, who make human nature the object of their enquiry. It is certain, that, in every religion, however &s;ublime the verbal definition, which it gives of its divinity, many of the votaries, perhaps the greate&s;t number, will &s;till &s;eek the divine fa|vour, not by virtue and good morals, which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, but either by frivolous ob&s;ervances, by intemperate zeal, by rapturous exta&s;ies, or by the belief of my&s;terious and ab&s;urd opinions. The lea&s;t part of the <HI>Sadder,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in precepts of morality; and we may be a&s;&s;ured, that that part was always the lea&s;t ob|&s;erved and regarded. When the old <HI>Romans</HI> were attacked with a pe&s;tilence, they never a&s;cribed their &s;ufferings to their vices, or dreamed of re|pentance and amendment. They never thought that they were the general robbers of the world, who&s;e ambition and avarice made de&s;olate the earth, and reduced opulent nations to want and beggary. They only created a dictator<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Called Dictator clavis figendae cau&s;a. T. Livii, l. vii. c. 3.</NOTE>, in
<PB N="104" REF="115">
order to drive a nail into a door; and by that means, they thought that they had &s;ufficiently appea&s;ed their incen&s;ed deity.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Aegina,</HI> one faction entering into a con|&s;piracy, barbarou&s;ly and treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated &s;even hundred of their fellow-citizens; and carried their fury &s;o far, that, one mi&s;er|able fugitive having fled to the temple, they cut off his hands, by which he clung to the gates, and carrying him out of holy ground, imme|diately murdered him. <HI>By this impiety,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Herodotus</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. vi.</NOTE>, (not by the other many cruel a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations) <HI>they offended the gods, and contracted an inexpiable guilt.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, what &s;eldom hap|pens, that a popular religion were found, in which it was expre&s;sly declared, that nothing but morality could gain the divine favour; if an order of prie&s;ts were in&s;tituted to inculcate this opinion, in daily &s;ermons, and with all the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion; yet &s;o inveterate are the people's prejudices, that for want of &s;ome other &s;uper&s;ti|tion, they would make the very attendance on the&s;e &s;ermons the e&s;&s;entials of religion, rather
<PB N="105" REF="116">
than place them in virtue and good morals. The &s;ublime prologue of <HI>Zaleucus's</HI> laws<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">To be found in Diod. Sic. lib. xii.</NOTE> in|&s;pired not the <HI>Locrians,</HI> &s;o far as we can learn, with any &s;ounder notions of the mea&s;ures of acceptance with the deity, than were familiar to the other <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation, then, holds univer&s;ally: But &s;till one may be at &s;ome lo&s;s to account for it. It is not &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the people, every where, degrade their deities into a &s;imilitude with them&s;elves, and con&s;ider them merely as a &s;pecies of human creatures, &s;ome|what more potent and intelligent. This will not remove the difficulty. For there is no <HI>man</HI> &s;o &s;tupid, as that, judging by his natural rea&s;on, he would not e&s;teem virtue and hone&s;ty the mo&s;t valuable qualities, which any per&s;on could po&s;&s;e&s;s. Why not a&s;cribe the &s;ame &s;entiment to his deity? Why not make all religion, or the chief part of it, to con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e attain|ments?</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;atisfactory to &s;ay, that the prac|tice of morality is more difficult than that of &s;uper&s;tition; and is therefore rejected. For,

not to mention the exce&s;&s;ive pennances of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> and <HI>Talapoins;</HI> it is certain, that the <HI>Rhamadan</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> during which the poor wretches, for many days, often in the hotte&s;t months of the year, and in &s;ome of the hotte&s;t climates of the world, remain without eating or drinking from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the &s;un; this <HI>Rhamadan,</HI> I &s;ay, mu&s;t be more &s;e|vere, than the practice of any moral duty, even to the mo&s;t vicious and depraved of mankind. The four lents of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and the au&s;te|rities of &s;ome <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> appear more di&s;agreable than meekne&s;s and benevolence. In &s;hort, all virtue, when men are reconciled to it by ever &s;o little practice, is agreeable: All &s;uper&s;tition is for ever odious and burthen&s;ome.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, the following account may be received as a true &s;olution of the difficulty. The duties, which a man performs as a friend or parent, &s;eem merely owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to the&s;e duties, without breaking thro' all the ties of nature and morality. A &s;trong inclination may prompt him to the performance: A &s;entiment of order and moral beauty joins its force to the&s;e natural tyes: And the whole man, if truly virtuous,
<PB N="107" REF="120">
is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour. Even with regard to the virtues, which are more au&s;tere, and more founded on reflection, &s;uch as public &s;pirit, filial duty, tem|perance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehen&s;ion, removes all pretence to reli|gious merit; and the virtuous conduct is e&s;teemed no more than what we owe to &s;ociety and to our&s;elves. In all this, a &s;uper&s;titious man finds nothing, which he has properly per|formed for the &s;ake of his deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favour and protection. He con&s;iders not, that the mo&s;t genuine method of &s;erving the divinity is by promoting the happine&s;s of his creatures. He &s;till looks out for &s;ome more immediate &s;ervice of the &s;upreme being, in order to allay tho&s;e terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice recommended to him, which either &s;erves to no purpo&s;e in life, or offers the &s;tronge&s;t violence to his natural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of tho&s;e very circum&s;tances, which &s;hould make him ab&s;olutely reject it. It &s;eems the more purely religious, that it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or con&s;idera|tion. And if, for its &s;ake, he &s;acrifices much
<PB N="108" REF="121">
of his ea&s;e and quiet, his claim of merit ap|pears &s;till to ri&s;e upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion, which he di&s;covers. In re&s;toring a loan, or paying a debt, his divinity is no way beholden to him; becau&s;e the&s;e acts of ju&s;tice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no god in the univer&s;e. But if he fa&s;t a day, or give him&s;elf a &s;ound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the &s;ervice of God. No other motive could engage him to &s;uch au&s;terities. By the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence, protection and &s;afety in this world, and eternal happine&s;s in the next.</P>
<P>HENCE the greate&s;t crimes have been found, in many in&s;tances, compatible with a &s;uper&s;ti|tious piety and devotion: Hence it is ju&s;tly re|garded as un&s;afe to draw any certain inference in favour of a man's mora's from the fervor or &s;trictne&s;s of his religious exerci&s;es, even tho' he him&s;elf believe them &s;incere. Nay, it has been ob&s;erved, that enormities of the blacke&s;t dye, have been rather apt to produce &s;uper&s;titious terrors, and encrea&s;e the religious pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Bo|milcar,</HI>

<P>TO which we may add, that, even after the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, there ari&s;e remor&s;es and &s;ecret horrors, which give no re&s;t to the mind, but make it have recour&s;e to religious rites and ceremonies, as expiations of its offences.

&s;teddy virtue, which either pre&s;erves us from di&s;a&s;trous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us to bear them. During &s;uch calm &s;un&s;hine of the mind, the&s;e &s;pectres of fal&s;e divinity never make their appearance. On the other hand, while we abandon our&s;elves to the natural, un|di&s;ciplined &s;ugge&s;tions of our timid and anxious hearts, every kind of barbarity is a&s;cribed to the &s;upreme being, from the terrors, with which we are agitated; and every kind of caprice, from the methods which we embrace, in order to ap|pea&s;e him. <HI>Barbarity, caprice;</HI> the&s;e qualities, however nominally di&s;gui&s;ed, we may univer|&s;ally ob&s;erve, to form the ruling character of the deity, in popular religions. Even prie&s;ts, in&s;tead of correcting the&s;e depraved ideas of mankind, have often been found ready to fo&s;ter and encourage them. The more tremendous the divinity is repre&s;ented, the more tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive do men become to his mini&s;ters: And the more unaccountable the mea&s;ures of acceptance required by him, the more nece&s;|&s;ary does it become to abandon our natural rea|&s;on, and yield to their gho&s;tly guidance and direction. And thus it may be allowed, that the artifices of men aggravate our natural in|firmities

GOOD and ill are univer&s;ally intermingled and confounded; happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, wi&s;dom and folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and entirely of a piece. All advantages are attended with di&s;advantages. An univer&s;al compen&s;ation prevails in all conditions of being and exi&s;tence. And it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for us, by our mo&s;t chi|merical wi&s;hes, to form the idea of a &s;tation or &s;ituation altogether de&s;irable. The draughts of life, according to the poet's fiction, are always mixed from the ve&s;&s;els on each hand of <HI>Jupiter:</HI> Or if any cup be pre&s;ented altogether pure, it is drawn only, as the &s;ame poet tells us, from the left-handed ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P>AS the good, the great, the &s;ublime, the ravi&s;hing are found eminently in the genuine principles of thei&s;m; it may be expected, from the analogy of nature, that the ba&s;e, the ab&s;urd, the mean, the terrifying will be di&s;covered equally in religious fictions and chimeras.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al propen&s;ity to believe in invi|&s;ible, intelligent power, if not an original in|&s;tinct, being at lea&s;t a general attendant of human nature, it may be con&s;idered as a kind of mark or &s;tamp, which the divine workman has &s;et upon his work; and nothing &s;urely can more dignify mankind, than to be thus &s;elected from all the other parts of the creation, and to bear the image or impre&s;&s;ion of the univer&s;al Create. But con&s;ult this image, as it commonly appears in the popular religions of the world. How is the deity disfigured in our repre&s;entations of him!

<P><PB N="123" REF="134">
PROBABILITY ari&s;es from an oppo&s;ition of contrary chances or cau&s;es, by which the mind is not allowed to fix on either &s;ide; but is in|ce&s;&s;antly to&s;t from one to another, and in one moment is determined to con&s;ider an object as exi&s;tent, and in another moment as the con|trary. The imagination or under&s;tanding, call it which you plea&s;e, fluctuates betwixt the op|po&s;ite views; and tho' perhaps it may be oftener turned to one &s;ide than the other, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for it, by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;ition of cau&s;es or chances, to re&s;t on either. The <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> of the que&s;tion alternately prevail; and the mind, &s;urveying the objects in their oppo&s;ite cau&s;es, finds &s;uch a contrariety as utterly de|&s;troys all certainty or e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, then, that the object, concerning which we are doubtful, produces either de&s;ire or aver&s;ion; it is evident, that, according as the mind turns it&s;elf to one &s;ide or the other, it mu&s;t feel a momentary impre&s;&s;ion of joy or &s;orrow. An object, who&s;e exi&s;tence we de&s;ire, gives &s;atisfaction, when we think of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which produce it; and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, excites grief or unea&s;ine&s;s, from the oppo|&s;ite con&s;ideration. So that, as the under&s;tanding,
<PB N="124" REF="135">
in probable que&s;tions, is divided betwixt the contrary points of view, the heart mu&s;t in the &s;ame manner be divided betwixt oppo&s;ite emo|tions.</P>
<P>NOW, if we con&s;ider the human mind, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that, with regard to the pa&s;&s;ions, it is not like a wind-in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, which, in running over all the notes, im|mediately lo&s;es the &s;ound when the breath cea&s;es; but rather re&s;embles a &s;tring-in&s;trument, where, after each &s;troke, the vibrations &s;till retain &s;ome &s;ound, which gradually and in&s;en|&s;ibly decays. The imagination is extremely quick and agile; but the pa&s;&s;ions, in compari|&s;on, are &s;low and re&s;tive: For which rea&s;on, when any object is pre&s;ented, which affords a variety of views to the one and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each &s;troke will not pro|duce a clear and di&s;tinct note of pa&s;&s;ion, but the one pa&s;&s;ion will always be mixt and confounded with the other. According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the pa&s;&s;ion of grief or joy predominates in the compo&s;ition; and the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, being intermingled by means of the
<PB N="125" REF="136">
contrary views of the imagination, produce by the union the pa&s;&s;ions of hope or fear.</P>
<P N="4">4. AS this theory &s;eems to carry its own evi|dence along with it, we &s;hall be more conci&s;e in our proofs.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope may ari&s;e, when the chances are equal on both &s;ides, and no &s;uperiority can be di&s;covered in one above the other. Nay, in this &s;ituation the pa&s;&s;ions are rather the &s;tronge&s;t, as the mind has then the lea&s;t foundation to re&s;t upon, and is to&s;t with the greate&s;t uncertainty. Throw in a &s;u|perior degree of probability to the &s;ide of grief, you immediately &s;ee that pa&s;&s;ion diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the compo&s;ition, and tincture it into fear. Encrea&s;e the probability, and by that means the grief; the fear prevails &s;till more and more, till at la&s;t it runs in&s;en&s;ibly, as the joy continually dimini&s;hes, into pure grief. After you have brought it to this &s;ituation, dimini&s;h the grief, by a contrary operation to that, which encrea&s;ed it, to wit, by dimini&s;hing the probability on the melancholy &s;ide; and you will &s;ee the pa&s;&s;ion clear every moment, till it changes in&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="126" REF="137">
into hope; which again runs, by &s;low degrees, into joy, as you encrea&s;e that part of the com|po&s;ition, by the encrea&s;e of the probability. Are not the&s;e as plain proofs, that the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray of the &s;un, pa&s;&s;ing thro' a pri&s;m, is a compo&s;ition of two others, when, as you dimini&s;h or en|crea&s;e the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably, more or le&s;s, in the compo|&s;ition?</P>
<P N="5">5. PROBABILITY is of two kinds; either when the object is it&s;elf uncertain, and to be deter|mined by chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain, yet is it uncertain to our judg|ment, which finds a number of proofs or pre|&s;umptions on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Both the&s;e kinds of probability cau&s;e fear and hope; which mu&s;t proceed from that property, in which they agree; to wit, the uncertainty and fluctuation which they be&s;tow on the pa&s;&s;ion, by that contrariety of views, which is common to both.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="127" REF="138">
6. IT is a probable good or evil, which com|monly cau&s;es hope or fear; becau&s;e probability, producing an incon&s;tant and wavering &s;urvey of an object, occa&s;ions naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of pa&s;&s;ion. But we may ob|&s;erve, that, wherever, from other cau&s;es, this mixture can be produced, the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope will ari&s;e, even tho' there be no pro|bability.</P>
<P>AN evil, conceived as barely <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;ome|times produces fear; e&s;pecially if the evil be very great. A man cannot think of exce&s;&s;ive pain and torture without trembling, if he runs the lea&s;t ri&s;que of &s;uffering them. The &s;mall|ne&s;s of the probability is compen&s;ated by the greatne&s;s of the evil.</P>
<P>BUT even <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> evils cau&s;e fear; as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know our&s;elves to be in perfect &s;ecurity, and have it in our choice, whether we will ad|vance a &s;tep farther. The immediate pre&s;ence of the evil influences the imagination and pro|duces a &s;pecies of belief; but being oppo&s;ed by the reflection on our &s;ecurity, that belief is im|mediately
<PB N="128" REF="139">
retracted, and cau&s;es the &s;ame kind of pa&s;&s;ion, as when, from a contrariety of chances, contrary pa&s;&s;ions are produced.</P>
<P>EVILS, which are <HI>certain,</HI> have &s;ometimes the &s;ame effect as the po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible. A man, in a &s;trong pri&s;on, without the lea&s;t means of e&s;cape, trembles at the thoughts of the rack, to which he is &s;entenced. The evil is here fixed in it&s;elf; but the mind has not cou|rage to fix upon it; and this fluctuation gives ri&s;e to a pa&s;&s;ion of a &s;imilar appearance with fear.</P>
<P N="7">7. BUT it is not only where good or evil is uncertain as to its <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> but al&s;o as to its <HI>kind,</HI> that fear or hope ari&s;es. If any one were told, that one of his &s;ons is &s;uddenly killed; the pa&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by this event, would not &s;ettle into grief, till he got certain information, which of his &s;ons he had lo&s;t. Tho' each &s;ide of the que&s;tion produces here the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion; that pa&s;&s;ion cannot &s;ettle, but receives from the imagination, which is unfixt, a tremulous, un|&s;teddy motion, re&s;embling the mixture and con|tention of grief and joy.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="129" REF="140">
8. THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a &s;trong connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cau&s;e any oppo&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions, by the op|po&s;ite views, which they pre&s;ent to us. Should I leave a friend in any malady, I &s;hould feel more anxiety upon his account, than if he were pre&s;ent; tho' perhaps I am not only incapable of giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but likewi&s;e of judging concerning the event of his &s;ickne&s;s. There are a thou&s;and little circum&s;tances of his &s;itua|tion and condition, which I de&s;ire to know; and the knowledge of them would prevent that fluctuation and uncertainty, &s;o nearly allied to fear. <HI>Horace</HI> has remarked this phaenomenon:<Q><L>Ut a&s;&s;idens implumibus pullus avis</L>
<L>Serpent&ucirc;m allap&s;us timet,</L>
<L>Magis relictis; non, ut ad&s;it, auxili</L>

<P>A VIRGIN on her bridal-night goes to bed full of fears and
apprehen&s;ions, tho' &s;he expects nothing but plea&s;ure. The confu&s;ion of wi&s;hes and joys, the newne&s;s and greatne&s;s of the un|known event, &s;o embarra&s;s the mind, that it knows not in what image or pa&s;&s;ion to fix it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="130" REF="141">
9. CONCERNING the mixture of affections, we may remark, in general, that when contrary pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e from objects no way connected to|gether, they take place alternately. Thus when a man is afflicted for the lo&s;s of a law-&s;uit, and joyful for the birth of a &s;on, the mind, running from the agreeable to the calamitous object; with whatever celerity it may perform this motion, can &s;carcely temper the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a &s;tate of indifference.</P>
<P>IT more ea&s;ily attains that calm &s;ituation, when the <HI>&s;ame</HI> event is of a mixt nature, and contains &s;omething adver&s;e and &s;omething pro|&s;perous in its different circum&s;tances. For in that ca&s;e, both the pa&s;&s;ions, mingling with each other by means of the relation, often become mutually de&s;tructive, and leave the mind in perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, that the object is not a com|pound of good and evil, but is con&s;idered as probable or improbable in any degree; in that ca&s;e, the contrary pa&s;&s;ions will both of them be pre&s;ent at once in the &s;oul, and in&s;tead of bal|lancing
<PB N="131" REF="142">
and tempering each other, will &s;ub&s;i&s;t together, and by their union, produce a third impre&s;&s;ion or affection, &s;uch as hope or fear.</P>
<P>THE influence of the relations of ideas (which we &s;hall afterwards explain more fully) is plainly &s;een in this affair. In contrary pa&s;&s;ions, if the objects be <HI>totally different,</HI> the pa&s;&s;ions are like two oppo&s;ite liquors in different bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be intimately <HI>connected,</HI> the pa&s;&s;ions are like an <HI>alcali</HI> or an <HI>acid,</HI> which, being mingled, de|&s;troy each other. If the relation be more im|perfect, and con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>contradictory</HI> views of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, the pa&s;&s;ions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never per|fectly unite and incorporate.</P>
<P>THE effect of a mixture of pa&s;&s;ions, when one of them is predominant and &s;wallows up the other, &s;hall be explained afterwards.</P>

<P N="1">1. BESIDES tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions abovemen|tioned, which ari&s;e from a direct pur&s;uit of good and aver&s;ion to evil, there are others of a more complicated nature, and imply more than one view or con&s;ideration. Thus <HI>Pride</HI> is a certain &s;atisfaction in our&s;elves, on account of &s;ome ac|compli&s;hment or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which we enjoy: <HI>Humility,</HI> on the other hand, is a di&s;&s;atisfaction with our&s;elves, on account of &s;ome defect or infirmity.</P>
<P>LOVE or <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is a complacency in an|other, on account of his accompli&s;hments or &s;er|vices: <HI>Hatred,</HI> the contrary.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the&s;e two &s;ets of pa&s;&s;ions, there is an obvious di&s;tinction to be made betwixt the <HI>ob|ject</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ion and its <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> The object of pride and humility is &s;elf: The cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;ome excellence in the former ca&s;e; &s;ome fault, in the latter. The object of love and hatred is &s;ome other per&s;on: The cau&s;es,
<PB N="133" REF="144">
in like manner, are either excellencies or faults.</P>
<P>WITH regard to all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, the cau&s;es are what excite the emotion; the object is what the mind directs its view to when the emotion is excited. Our merit, for in&s;tance, rai&s;es pride; and it is e&s;&s;ential to pride to turn our view on our&s;elf with complacency and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Now as the cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are very numerous and various, tho' their object be uni|form and &s;imple; it may be a &s;ubject of curio|&s;ity to con&s;ider, what that circum&s;tance is, in which all the&s;e various cau&s;es agree; or, in other words, what is the real, efficient cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion. We &s;hall begin with pride and hu|mility.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN order to explain the cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, we mu&s;t reflect on certain properties, which, tho' they have a mighty influence on every operation, both of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions, are not commonly much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the <HI>a&s;&s;|ciation</HI> of ideas, or that principle, by which we
<PB N="134" REF="145">
make an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from one idea to another. However uncertain and changeable our thoughts may be, they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes. They u&s;ually pa&s;s with regularity, from one object, to what re|&s;embles it, is contiguous to it, or produced by it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ays. E&s;&s;ay iii.</NOTE>. When one idea is pre&s;ent to the imagina|tion; any other, united by the&s;e relations, na|turally follows it, and enters with more facility, by means of that introduction.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> property, which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the human mind, is a like a&s;&s;ociation of im|pre&s;&s;ions or emotions. All <HI>re&s;embling</HI> impre&s;|&s;ions are connected together; and no &s;ooner one ari&s;es, than the re&s;t naturally follow. Grief and di&s;appointment give ri&s;e to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again. In like manner, our temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throws it&s;elf into love, ge|nero&s;ity, courage, pride, and other re&s;embling affections.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, it is ob&s;ervable of the&s;e two kinds of a&s;&s;ociation, that they very much
<PB N="135" REF="146">
a&s;&s;i&s;t and forward each other, and that the tran&s;ition is more ea&s;ily made, where they both concur in the &s;ame object. Thus, a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much di&s;|compo&s;ed and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred &s;ubjects of hatred, di&s;content, impatience, fear, and other unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions; e&s;pecially, if he can di&s;cover the&s;e &s;ubjects in or near the per&s;on, who was the object of his fir&s;t emotion. Tho&s;e principles, which forward the tran&s;ition of ideas, here concur with tho&s;e, which operate on the pa&s;&s;ions; and both, unit|ing in one action, be&s;tow on the mind a double impul&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion, I may cite a pa&s;&s;age from an elegant writer, who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following manner<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Addi&s;on, Spectator, No 412.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the fancy delights in every thing, that is great, &s;trange, or beautiful, and is &s;till the more plea&s;ed the more it finds of the&s;e perfections in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, &s;o it is capable of receiving new &s;atis|faction by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another &s;en&s;e. Thus, any continued &s;ound, as the mu&s;ic of birds, or a fall of waters, awakens every
<PB N="136" REF="147">
moment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to the &s;everal beauties of the place, that lie before him. Thus, if there ari&s;es a fragrancy of &s;mells or perfumes, they heighten the plea&s;ure of the imagination, and make even the colours and verdure of the land&s;cape appear more agreeable; for the ideas of both &s;en&s;es recommend each other, and are plea&s;anter together than where they enter the mind &s;eparately: As the different colours of a picture, when they are well di&s;|po&s;ed, &s;et off one another, and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the &s;ituation."</Q> In the&s;e phaenomena, we may remark the a&s;&s;ociation both of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas; as well as the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance the&s;e a&s;|&s;ociations lend to each other.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT &s;eems to me, that both the&s;e &s;pecies of relation have place in producing <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Humility,</HI> and are the real, efficient cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the fir&s;t relation, that of ideas, there can be no que&s;tion. Whatever we are proud of, mu&s;t, in &s;ome manner, be|long
<PB N="137" REF="148">
to us. It is always <HI>our</HI> knowledge, <HI>our</HI> &s;en&s;e, beauty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, family, on which we value our&s;elves. Self, which is the <HI>object</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t &s;till be related to that quality or circum&s;tance, which <HI>cau&s;es</HI> the pa&s;&s;ion. There mu&s;t be a connexion betwixt them; an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the imagination; or a facility of the conception in pa&s;&s;ing from one to the other. Where this connexion is wanting, no object can either excite pride or humility; and the more you weaken the connexion, the more you weaken the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE only &s;ubject of enquiry is, whether there be a like relation of impre&s;&s;ions or &s;enti|ments, wherever pride or humility is felt; whether the circum&s;tance, which cau&s;es the pa&s;|&s;ion, produces antecedently a &s;entiment &s;imilar to the pa&s;&s;ion; and whether there be an ea&s;y transfu&s;ion of the one into the other.</P>
<P>THE feeling or &s;entiment of pride is agree|able; of humility, painful. An agreeable &s;en|&s;ation is, therefore, related to the former; a painful, to the latter. And if we find, after examination, that every object, which produces
<PB N="138" REF="149">
pride, produces al&s;o a &s;eparate plea&s;ure; and every object, that cau&s;es humility, excites in like manner a &s;eparate unea&s;ine&s;s; we mu&s;t al|low, in that ca&s;e, that the pre&s;ent theory is fully proved and a&s;certained. The double relation of ideas and &s;entiments will be acknowledged inconte&s;tible.</P>
<P N="6">6. To begin with per&s;onal merit and demerit, the mo&s;t obvious cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; it would be entirely foreign to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to examine the foundation of moral di&s;tinc|tions. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the fore|going theory concerning the origin of the pa&s;|&s;ions may be defended on any hypothe&s;is. The mo&s;t probable &s;y&s;tem, which has been advanced to explain the difference betwixt vice and vir|tue, is, that either from a primary con&s;titution of nature, or from a &s;en&s;e of public or private intere&s;t, certain characters, upon the very view and contemplation, produce unea&s;ine&s;s; and others, in like manner, excite plea&s;ure. The unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;atisfaction, produced in the &s;pec|tator, are e&s;&s;ential to vice and virtue. To ap|prove of a character, is to feel a delight upon its appearance. To di&s;approve of it, is to be &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="139" REF="150">
of an unea&s;ine&s;s. The pain and plea&s;ure, therefore, being, in a manner, the primary &s;ource of blame or prai&s;e, mu&s;t al&s;o be the cau&s;es of all their effects; and con&s;equently, the cau&s;es of pride and humility, which are the un|avoidable attendants of that di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing this theory of morals &s;hould not be received; it is &s;till evident, that pain and plea&s;ure, if not the &s;ources of moral di&s;tinctions, are at lea&s;t in&s;eparable from them. A gene|rous and noble character affords a &s;atisfaction even in the &s;urvey; and when pre&s;ented to us, tho' only in a poem or fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the other hand, cruelty and treachery di&s;plea&s;e from their very nature; nor is it po&s;&s;ible ever to reconcile us to the&s;e qualities, either in our&s;elves or others. Virtue, therefore, produces always a plea&s;ure di&s;tinct from the pride or &s;elf &s;atisfaction, which attends it: Vice, an unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eparate from the humility or remor&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT a high or low conceit of our&s;elves ari&s;es not from tho&s;e qualities alone of the mind, which, according to common &s;y&s;tems of ethics, have been defined parts of moral duty; but from any
<PB N="140" REF="151">
other, which have a connexion with plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. Nothing flatters our vanity more than the talent of plea&s;ing by our wit, good humour, or any other accompli&s;hment; and nothing gives us a more &s;en&s;ible mortification, than a di&s;appointment in any attempt of that kind. No one has ever been able to tell pre|ci&s;ely, what <HI>wit</HI> is, and to &s;hew why &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of thought mu&s;t be received under that denomination, and &s;uch another rejected. It is by ta&s;te alone we can decide concerning it; nor are we po&s;&s;e&s;t of any other &s;tandard, by which we can form a judgment of this nature. Now what is this <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> from which true and fal&s;e wit in a manner receive their being, and without which no thought can have a title to either of the&s;e denominations? It is plainly nothing but a &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure from true wit, and of di&s;|gu&s;t from fal&s;e, without our being able to tell the rea&s;ons of that &s;atisfaction or unea&s;ine&s;s. The power of exciting the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ations is, therefore, the very e&s;&s;ence of true of fal&s;e wit; and con&s;equently, the cau&s;e of that vanity or mortification, which ari&s;es from one or the other.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="141" REF="152">
7. BEAUTY of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight and &s;atisfaction; as deformity produces pain, upon whatever &s;ubject it may be placed, and whether &s;urveyed in an animate or inanimate object. If the beauty or deformity belong to our own face, &s;hape, or per&s;on, this plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s is converted into pride or humility; as having in this ca&s;e all the circum&s;tances re|qui&s;ite to produce a perfect tran&s;ition, accord|ing to the pre&s;ent theory.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem, that the very e&s;&s;ence of beauty con&s;i&s;ts in its power of producing plea|&s;ure. All its effects, therefore, mu&s;t proceed from this circum&s;tance: And if beauty is &s;o uni|ver&s;ally the &s;ubject of vanity, it is only from its being the cau&s;e of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>CONCERNING all other bodily accompli&s;h|ments, we may ob&s;erve in general, that what|ever in our&s;elves is either u&s;eful, beautiful, or &s;urprizing, is an object of pride; and the con|trary, of humility. The&s;e qualities agree in producing a &s;eparate plea&s;ure; and agree in no|thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="153">
WE are vain of the &s;urprizing adventures which we have met with, the e&s;capes which we have made, the dangers to which we have been expo&s;ed; as well as of our &s;urpri&s;ing feats of vigour and activity. Hence the origin of vul|gar lying; where men, without any intere&s;t, and merely out of vanity, heap up a number of extraordinary events, which are either the fic|tions of their brain; or, if true, have no con|nexion with them&s;elves. Their fruitful inven|tion &s;upplies them with a variety of adventures; and where that talent is wanting, they appro|priate &s;uch as belong to others, in order to gra|tify their vanity: For betwixt that pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;entiment of plea&s;ure, there is always a clo&s;e connexion.</P>
<P N="8">8. BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body, that is, of &s;elf, for their natural and more immediate cau&s;es; we find by experience, that many other objects produce the&s;e affections. We found vanity upon hou&s;es, gardens, equipage, and other ex|ternal objects; as well as upon per&s;onal merit and accompli&s;hments. This happens when ex|ternal objects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> any particular relation to
<PB N="143" REF="154">
our&s;elves, and are a&s;&s;ociated or connected with us. A beautiful fi&s;h in the ocean, a well pro|portioned animal in a fore&s;t, and indeed any thing, which neither belongs nor is related to us, has no manner of influence on our vanity; whatever extraordinary qualities it may be en|dowed with, and whatever degree of &s;urprize and admiration it may naturally occa&s;ion. It mu&s;t be &s;omeway a&s;&s;ociated with us, in order to touch our pride. It's idea mu&s;t hang, in a man|ner, upon that of our&s;elves; and the tran&s;ition from one to the other mu&s;t be ea&s;y and natural.</P>
<P>MEN are vain of the beauty either of <HI>their</HI> country, or <HI>their</HI> county, or even of <HI>their</HI> pari&s;h. Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a plea|&s;ure. This plea&s;ure is related to pride. The object or cau&s;e of this plea&s;ure is, by the &s;uppo|&s;ition, related to &s;elf, the object of pride. By this double relation of &s;entiments and ideas, a tran&s;ition is made from one to the other.</P>
<P>MEN are al&s;o vain of the temperature of the climate, in which they are born; of the ferti|lity of their native &s;oil; of the goodne&s;s of the wines, fruits, or victuals, produced by it; of the &s;oftne&s;s or force of their language, with
<PB N="144" REF="155">
other particulars of that kind. The&s;e objects have plainly a reference to the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es, and are originally con&s;idered as agree|able to the feeling, ta&s;te, or hearing. How could they become cau&s;es of pride, except by means of that tran&s;ition above explained?</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome, who di&s;cover a vanity of an oppo&s;ite kind, and affect to depreciate their own country, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e, to which they have travelled. The&s;e per&s;ons find, when they are at home, and &s;urrounded with their countrymen, that the &s;trong relation betwixt them and their own nation is &s;har'd with &s;o many, that it is in a manner lo&s;t to them; whereas, that di&s;tant relation to a foreign coun|try, which is formed by their having &s;een it, and lived in it, is augmented by their con&s;ider|ing how few have done the &s;ame. For this rea|&s;on, they always admire the beauty, utility, and rarity of what they have met with abroad, above what they find at home.</P>
<P>SINCE we can be vain of a country, climate, or any inanimate object, which bears a relation to us; it is no wonder we &s;hould be vain of the qualities of tho&s;e, who are connected with us
<PB N="145" REF="156">
by blood or friend&s;hip. Accordingly we find, that any qualities, which, when belonging to our|&s;elf, produce pride, produce al&s;o, in a le&s;s degree, the &s;ame affection, when di&s;covered in per&s;ons, related to us. The beauty, addre&s;s, merit, credit, and honours of their kindred are care|fully di&s;played by the proud, and are con&s;ider|able &s;ources of their vanity.</P>
<P>As we are proud of riches in our&s;elves, we de&s;ire, in order to gratify our vanity, that every one, who has any connexion with us, &s;hould likewi&s;e be po&s;&s;e&s;t of them, and are a&s;hamed of &s;uch as are mean or poor among our friends and relations. Our forefathers being conceived as our neare&s;t relations; every one naturally affects to be of a good family, and to be de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rich and honourable ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THOSE, who boa&s;t of the antiquity of their fa|milies, are glad when they can join this circum|&s;tance, that their ance&s;tors, for many generations, have been uinnterrupted proprietors of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> portion of land, and that their family has never changed its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or been tran&s;planted into any other county or province. It is an additional
<PB N="146" REF="157">
&s;ubject of vanity, when they can boa&s;t, that the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have been tran&s;mitted thro' a de&s;cent, compo&s;ed entirely of males, and that the ho|nours and fortune have never pa&s;t thro' any fe|male. Let us endeavour to explain the&s;e phae|nomena from the foregoing theory.</P>
<P>WHEN any one values him&s;elf on the antiquity of his family, the &s;ubjects of his va|nity are not merely the extent of time and number of ance&s;tors (for in that re&s;pect all mankind are alike) but the&s;e circum&s;tances, joined to the riches and credit of his ance&s;|tors, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect a lu&s;tre on him&s;elf, upon account of his connextion with them. Since therefore the pa&s;&s;ion depends on the connexion, whatever &s;trengthens the con|nexion mu&s;t al&s;o encrea&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, and what|ever weakens the connexion mu&s;t dimini&s;h the pa&s;&s;ion. But it is evident, that the &s;amene&s;s of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions mu&s;t &s;trengthen the relation of ideas, ari&s;ing from blood and kindred, and con|vey the fancy with greater facility from one ge|neration to another; from the remote&s;t ance|&s;tors to their po&s;terity, who are both their heirs and their de&s;cendants. By this facility, the &s;enti|ment is tran&s;mitted more entire, and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="158">
THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the honours and fortune, thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of males, without their pa&s;&s;ing thro' any female. It is an obvious quality of human nature, that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is important and con&s;iderable; and where two objects are pre&s;ented, a &s;mall and a great, it u&s;ually leaves the former, and dwells entirely on the latter. This is the rea&s;on, why children commonly bear their fathers name, and are e&s;teemed to be of a nobler or meaner birth, ac|cording to <HI>his</HI> family. And tho' the mother &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;uperior qualities to the father, as often happens, the <HI>general rule</HI> pre|vails, notwith&s;tanding the exception, according to the doctrine, which &s;hall be explained after|wards. Nay, even when a &s;uperiority of any kind is &s;o great, or when any other rea&s;ons have &s;uch an effect, as to make the children rather repre&s;ent the mother's family than the fa|ther's, the general rule &s;till retains an efficacy, &s;ufficient to weaken the relation, and make a kind of breach in the line of ance&s;tors. The imagination runs not along them with the &s;ame facility, nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ance&s;tors to their po&s;terity of the &s;ame name and family &s;o readily, as when the
<PB N="148" REF="159">
tran&s;ition is conformable to the general rules, and pa&s;&s;es thro' the male line, from father to &s;on, or from brother to brother.</P>
<P N="9">9. BUT <HI>property,</HI> as it gives us the fulle&s;t power and authority over any object, is the re|lation, which has the greate&s;t influence on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>EVERY thing, belonging to a vain man, is the be&s;t that is any where to be found. His hou&s;es, equipage, furniture, cloaths, hor&s;es, hounds, ex|cel all others in his conceit; and it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that, from the lea&s;t advantage in any of the&s;e, he draws a new &s;ubject of pride and vanity. His wine, if you will believe him, has a finer flavour than any other; his cookery is more exqui&s;ite; his table more orderly; his &s;ervants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more healthful; the &s;oil, which he culti|vates, more fertile; his fruits ripen earlier, and in greater perfection: Such a thing is remark|able for it's novelty; &s;uch another for it's anti|quity: This is the workman&s;hip of a famous arti&s;t; that belonged once to &s;uch a prince or great man. All objects, in a word, which are
<PB N="149" REF="160">
u&s;eful, beautiful, or &s;urprizing, or are related to &s;uch, may, by means of property, give ri&s;e to this pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e all agree in giving plea|&s;ure. This alone is common to them; and therefore mu&s;t be the quality, that produces the pa&s;&s;ion, which is their common effect. As every new in&s;tance is a new argument, and as the in&s;tances are here without number; it would &s;eem, that this theory is &s;ufficiently confirmed by experience.</P>
<P>RICHES imply the power of acquiring what|ever is agreeable; and as they comprehend many particular objects of vanity, nece&s;&s;arily become one of the chief cau&s;es of that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="10">10. OUR opinions of all kinds are &s;trongly affected by &s;ociety and &s;ympathy, and it is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;upport any principle or &s;entiment, again&s;t the univer&s;al con&s;ent of every one, with whom we have any friend&s;hip or corre&s;pondence. But of all our opinions, tho&s;e, which we form in our own favour; how|ever lofty or pre&s;uming; are, at bottom, the fraile&s;t, and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;haken by the con|tradiction
<PB N="150" REF="161">
and oppo&s;ition of others. Our great concern, in this ca&s;e, makes us &s;oon alarmed, and keeps our pa&s;&s;ions upon the watch: Our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of partiality &s;till makes us dread a mi&s;take: And the very difficulty of judging con|cerning an object, which is never &s;et at a due di&s;tance from us, nor is &s;een in a proper point of view, makes us hearken anxiou&s;ly to the opinions of others, who are better qualified to form ju&s;t opinions concerning us. Hence that &s;trong love of fame, with which all mankind are po&s;&s;e&s;t. It is in order to fix and confirm their favourable opinion of them&s;elves, not from any original pa&s;&s;ion, that they &s;eek the applau&s;es of others. And when a man de&s;ires to be prai&s;ed, it is for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that a beauty is plea&s;ed with &s;urveying her&s;elf in a favorable looking-gla&s;s, and &s;eeing the reflexion of her own charms.</P>
<P>THO' it be difficult in all points of &s;pecula|tion to di&s;tingui&s;h a cau&s;e, which encrea&s;es an effect, from one, which &s;olely produces it; yet in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the phaenomena &s;eem pretty &s;trong and &s;atisfactory in confirmation of the foregoing principle.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="162">
WE receive a much greater &s;atisfaction from the approbation of tho&s;e, whom we our&s;elves e&s;teem and approve of, than of tho&s;e, whom we contemn and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN e&s;teem is obtained after a long and intimate acquaintance, it gratifies our vanity in a peculiar manner.</P>
<P>THE &s;uffrage of tho&s;e, who are &s;hy and backward in giving prai&s;e, is attended with an additional reli&s;h and enjoyment, if we can ob|tain it in our favour.</P>
<P>WHERE a great man is nice in his choice of favourites, every one courts with greater earne&s;t|ne&s;s his countenance and protection.</P>

<P>THESE phaenomena &s;eem to prove, that the favourable opinions of others are regarded only as authorities, or as confirmations of our own opinion. And if they have more influ|ence in this &s;ubject than in any other, it is
<PB N="152" REF="163">
ea&s;ily accounted for from the nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="11">11. THUS few objects, however related to us, and whatever plea&s;ure they produce, are able to excite a great degree of pride or &s;elf-&s;a|tisfaction; unle&s;s they be al&s;o obvious to others, and engage the approbation of the &s;pectators. What di&s;po&s;ition of mind &s;o de&s;irable as the peaceful, re&s;igned, contented; which readily &s;ubmits to all the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, and pre&s;erves a con&s;tant &s;erenity amid&s;t the greate&s;t misfortunes and di&s;appointments? Yet this di&s;po&s;ition, tho' acknowledged to be a vir|tue or excellence, is &s;eldom the foundation of great vanity or &s;elf-applau&s;e; having no brilliant or exterior lu&s;tre, and rather cheering the heart, than animating the behaviour and conver&s;ation. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with many other qualities of the mind, body, or fortune; and this cir|cum&s;tance, as well as the double relations above mentioned, mu&s;t be admitted to be of con&s;e|quence in the production of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A SECOND circum&s;tance, which is of con&s;e|quence in this affair, is the con&s;tancy and dura|tion
<PB N="153" REF="164">
of the object. What is very ca&s;ual and in|con&s;tant, beyond the common cour&s;e of human affairs, gives little joy, and le&s;s pride. We are not much &s;atisfied with the thing it&s;elf; and are &s;till le&s;s apt to feel any new degree of &s;elf|&s;atisfaction upon its account. We fore&s;ee and anticipate its change; which makes us little &s;atisfied with the thing it&s;elf: We compare it to our&s;elves, who&s;e exi&s;tence is more durable; by which means its incon&s;tancy appears &s;till greater. It &s;eems ridiculous to make our&s;elves the object of a pa&s;&s;ion, on account of a quality or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is of &s;o much &s;horter dura|tion, and attends us during &s;o &s;mall a part of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A THIRD circum&s;tance, not to be neglected, is, that the objects, in order to produce pride or &s;elf-value, mu&s;t be peculiar to us, or at lea&s;t, common to us with a few others. The advan|tages of &s;un-&s;hine, weather, climate, &amp;c. di|&s;tingui&s;h us not from any of our companions, and give us no preference or &s;uperiority. The compari&s;on, which we are every moment apt to make, pre&s;ents no inference to our advantage; and we &s;till remain, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e en|joyments,
<PB N="154" REF="165">
on a level with all our friends and acquaintance.</P>
<P>AS health and &s;ickne&s;s vary ince&s;&s;antly to all men, and there is no one, who is &s;olely or cer|tainly fixed in either; the&s;e accidental ble&s;&s;ings and calamities are in a manner &s;eparated from us, and are not con&s;idered as a foundation for vanity or humiliation. But wherever a malady of any kind is &s;o rooted in our con&s;titution, that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery, from that moment it damps our &s;elf-conceit; as is evident in old men, whom nothing mortifies more than the con&s;ideration of their age and in|firmities. They endeavour, as long as po&s;&s;ible, to conceal their blindne&s;s and deafne&s;s, their rheums and gouts; nor do they ever avow them without reluctance and unea&s;ine&s;s. And tho' young men are not a&s;hamed of every head-ach or cold which they fall into; yet no topic is more proper to mortify human pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature, than this, that we are every moment of our lives &s;ub|ject to &s;uch infirmities. This proves, that bo|dily pain and &s;ickne&s;s are in them&s;elves proper cau&s;es of humility; tho' the cu&s;tom of e&s;timat|ing every thing, by compari&s;on, more than by
<PB N="155" REF="166">
its intrin&s;ic worth and value, makes us over|look tho&s;e calamities, which we find incident to every one, and cau&s;es us to form an idea of our merit and character, independent of them.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;hamed of &s;uch maladies as affect others, and are either dangerous or di&s;agreeable to them. Of the epilep&s;y; becau&s;e it gives a horror to every one pre&s;ent: Of the itch; be|cau&s;e it is infectious: Of the king's evil; be|cau&s;e it often goes to po&s;terity. Men al|ways con&s;ider the &s;entiments of others in their judgment of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A FOURTH circum&s;tance, which has an in|fluence on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, is <HI>general rules;</HI> by which we form a notion of different ranks of men, &s;uitable to the power or riches of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;t; and this notion is not changed by any peculiarities of the health or temper of the per&s;ons, which may deprive them of all enjoyment in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Cu&s;tom rea|dily carries us beyond the ju&s;t bounds in our pa&s;&s;ions, as well as in our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve on this occa|&s;ion, that the influence of general rules and
<PB N="156" REF="167">
maxims on the pa&s;&s;ions very much contributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles or internal mechani&s;m, which we here explain. For it &s;eems evident, that, if a per&s;on full-grown, and of the &s;ame nature with our&s;elves, were on a &s;udden tran&s;ported into our world, he would be very much embarra&s;&s;ed with every object, and would not readily determine what degree of love or hatred, of pride or humility, or of any other pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be excited by it. The pa&s;&s;ions are often varied by very incon|&s;iderable principles; and the&s;e do not always play with perfect regularity, e&s;pecially on the the fir&s;t tryal. But as cu&s;tom or practice has brought to light all the&s;e principles, and has &s;ettled the ju&s;t value of every thing; this mu&s;t certainly contribute to the ea&s;y production of the pa&s;&s;ions, and guide us, by means of general e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, in the proportions, which we ought to ob&s;erve in prefering one object to another. This remark may, perhaps, &s;erve to obviate difficulties, that may ari&s;e concerning &s;ome cau&s;es, which we here a&s;cribe to particular pa&s;&s;ions, and which may be e&s;teemed too re|fined to operate &s;o univer&s;ally and certainly, as they are found to do.</P>

<P N="1">1. IN running over all the cau&s;es, which produce the pa&s;&s;ion of pride or that of humility; it would readily occur, that the &s;ame circum|&s;tance, if transferred from our&s;elf to another per&s;on, would render him the object of love or hatred, e&s;teem or contempt. The virtue, ge|nius, beauty, family, riches, and authority of others beget favourable &s;entiments in their be|half; and their vice, folly, deformity, poverty, and meanne&s;s excite the contrary &s;entiments. The double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas &s;till operates on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred; as on the former of pride and humility. What|ever gives a &s;eparate plea&s;ure or pain, and is re|lated to another per&s;on or connected with him, makes him the object of our affection or di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<P>A PERSON, who is related to us, or con|nected with us, by blood, by &s;imilitude of for|tune, of adventures, profe&s;&s;ion, or country, &s;oon becomes an agreeable companion to us; becau&s;e we enter ea&s;ily and familiarly into his &s;entiments and conceptions: Nothing is &s;trange or new to us: Our imagination, pa&s;&s;ing from &s;elf, which is ever intimately pre&s;ent to us, runs &s;moothly along the relation or connexion, and conceives with a full &s;ympathy the per&s;on, who is nearly related to &s;elf. He renders him|&s;elf immediately acceptable, and is at once on an ea&s;y footing with us: No di&s;tance, no re&s;erve has place, where the per&s;on introduced is &s;up|po&s;ed &s;o clo&s;ely connected with us.</P>
<P>RELATION has here the &s;ame influence as cu&s;tom or acquaintance, in exciting affection;

and from like cau&s;es. The ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction, which, in both ca&s;es, attend our intercour&s;e or commerce, is the &s;ource of the friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred are al|ways followed by, or rather conjoined with, be|nevolence and anger. It is this conjunction, which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e affections from pride and humility. For pride and humility are pure emotions in the &s;oul, unattended with any de&s;ire, and not immediately exciting us to action. But love and hatred are not compleat within them&s;elves, nor re&s;t in that emotion, which they produce; but carry the mind to &s;omething farther. Love is always followed by a de&s;ire of happine&s;s to the per&s;on beloved, and an aver&s;ion to his mi&s;ery: As hatred produces a de&s;ire of the mi&s;ery, and an aver&s;ion to the happine&s;s of the per&s;on hated.

4. COMPASSION frequently ari&s;es, where there is no preceding e&s;teem or friend&s;hip; and compa&s;&s;ion is an unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;ufferings of another. It &s;eems to &s;pring from the intimate and &s;trong conception of his &s;ufferings; and our imagination proceeds by degrees, from the lively idea, to the real feeling of another's mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>MALICE and envy al&s;o ari&s;e in the mind without any preceding hatred or injury; tho' their tendency is exactly the &s;ame with that of anger and ill-will. The compari&s;on of our&s;elves with others &s;eems the &s;ource of envy and malice. The more unhappy another is, the more happy do we our&s;elves appear in our own conception.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE &s;imilar tendency of compa&s;&s;ion to that of benevolence, and of envy to anger, forms a very clo&s;e relation betwixt the&s;e two &s;ets of pa&s;&s;ions; tho' of a different kind from that in|&s;i&s;ted on above. It is not a re&s;emblance of feel|ing or &s;entiment, but a re&s;emblance of tendency or direction. Its effect, however, is the &s;ame, in producing an a&s;&s;ociation of pa&s;&s;ions. Com|pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="161" REF="172">
is &s;eldom or never felt without &s;ome mixture of tenderne&s;s or friend&s;hip; and envy is naturally accompanied with anger or ill-will. To de&s;ire the happine&s;s of another, from what|ever motive, is a good preparative to affection: And to delight in another's mi&s;ery almo&s;t un|avoidably begets aver&s;ion towards him.</P>
<P>EVEN where intere&s;t is the &s;ource of our con|cern, it is commonly attended with the &s;ame con&s;equences. A partner is a natural object of friend&s;hip; a rival of enmity.</P>
<P N="6">6. POVERTY, meanne&s;s, di&s;appointment, pro|duce contempt and di&s;like: But when the&s;e mi&s;|fortunes are very great, or are repre&s;ented to us in very &s;trong colours, they excite compa&s;&s;ion, and tenderne&s;s, and friend&s;hip. How is this con|tradiction to be accounted for? The poverty and meanne&s;s of another, in their common ap|pearance, gives us unea&s;ine&s;s, by a &s;pecies of imperfect &s;ympathy; and this unea&s;ine&s;s pro|duces aver&s;ion or di&s;like, from the re&s;emblance of &s;entiment.

<P N="2">2. THE virtues, talents, accompli&s;hments, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of others make us love and e&s;teem them: Becau&s;e the&s;e objects excite a plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation, which is related to love; and having al&s;o a relation or connexion with the per&s;on, this union of ideas forwards the union of &s;enti|ments, according to the foregoing rea&s;oning.</P>

<P N="3">3. BUT it is ob&s;ervable, that, if we rever&s;e the order of the pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame effect does not follow.

We love not tho&s;e related to us on account of our own merit; tho' they are naturally vain on account of our merit. What is the rea&s;on of this difference? The tran&s;ition of the imagination to our&s;elves, from objects related to us, is always very ea&s;y; both on account of the relation, which facilitates the tran&s;ition, and becau&s;e we there pa&s;s from re|moter objects to tho&s;e which are contiguous. But in pa&s;&s;ing from our&s;elves to objects, related to us; tho' the former principle forwards the tran&s;ition of thought, yet the latter oppo&s;es it; and con&s;equently there is not the &s;ame ea&s;y
<PB N="165" REF="176">
transfu&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ions from pride to love as from love to pride.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE virtues, &s;ervices, and fortune of one man in&s;pire us readily with e&s;teem and affection for another related to him. The &s;on of our friend is naturally entitled to our friend&s;hip: The kindred of a very great man value them|&s;elves, and are valued by others, on account of that relation. The force of the double relation is here fully di&s;played.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE following are in&s;tances of another kind, where the operation of the&s;e principles may &s;till be di&s;covered. Envy ari&s;es from a &s;u|periority in others; but it is ob&s;ervable, that it is not the great di&s;proportion betwixt us, which excites that pa&s;&s;ion, but on the contrary, our proximity. A great di&s;proportion cuts off the relation of the ideas, and either keeps us from comparing our&s;elves with what is remote from us, or dimini&s;hes the effects of the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>A POET is not apt to envy a philo&s;opher or a poet of a different kind, of a different nation,
<PB N="166" REF="177">
or of a different age. All the&s;e differences, if they do not prevent, at lea&s;t weaken the com|pari&s;on, and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS too is the rea&s;on, why all objects appear great or little, merely by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies. A mountain neither magnifies nor dimini&s;hes a hor&s;e in our eyes: But when a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> and a <HI>Welch</HI> hor&s;e are &s;een together, the one appears greater and the other le&s;s, than when viewed apart.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principle we may account for that remark of hi&s;torians, that any party, in a civil war, or even factious divi&s;ion, always choo&s;e to call in a foreign enemy at any hazard rather than &s;ubmit to their fellow-citizens. <HI>Guicciardin</HI> applies this remark to the wars in <HI>Italy;</HI> where the relations betwixt the different &s;tates are, properly &s;peaking, nothing but of name, language, and contiguity. Yet even the&s;e relations, when joined with &s;uperiority, by making the compari&s;on more natural, make it likewi&s;e more grievous, and cau&s;e men to &s;earch for &s;ome other &s;uperiority, which may be attended with no relation, and by that means, may have a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible influence on the
<PB N="167" REF="178">
imagination. When we cannot break the a&s;&s;o|ciation, we feel a &s;tronger de&s;ire to remove the &s;uperiority. This &s;eems to be the rea&s;on, why travellers, tho' commonly lavi&s;h of their prai&s;es to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> take care to depre|ciate tho&s;e neighbouring nations, which may &s;tand upon a footing of rival&s;hip with their na|tive country.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE fine arts afford us parallel in&s;tances. Should an author compo&s;e a treati&amp;;se, of which one part was &s;erious and profound, another light and humourous; every one would condemn &s;o &s;trange a mixture, and would blame him for the neglect of all rules of art and critici&s;m. Yet we accu&s;e not <HI>Prior</HI> for joining his <HI>Alma</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> in the &s;ame volume; tho' that amiable poet has &s;ucceeded perfectly in the gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy of the other. Even &s;uppo&s;e the reader &s;hould peru&s;e the&s;e two compo&s;itions without any interval, he would feel little or no difficulty in the change of the pa&s;&s;ions. Why? but becau&s;e he con&s;iders the&s;e performances as entirely different; and by that break in the ideas, breaks the progre&s;s
<PB N="168" REF="179">
of the affections, and hinders the one from in|fluencing or contradicting the other.</P>
<P>AN heroic and burle&s;que de&s;ign, united in one picture, would be mon&s;trous; tho' we place two pictures of &s;o oppo&s;ite a character in the &s;ame chamber, and even clo&s;e together, with|out any &s;cruple.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT needs be no matter of wonder, that the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the imagination &s;hould have &s;uch an influence on all the pa&s;&s;ions. It is this very circum&s;tance, which forms all the rela|tions and connexions among&s;t objects. We know no real connexion betwixt one thing and another. We know only, that the idea of one thing is a&s;&s;ociated with that of another, and that the imagination makes an ea&s;y tran&s;ition betwixt them. And as the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas, and that of &s;entiments mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; we might beforehand expect, that this principle mu&s;t have a mighty influence on all our internal movements and affections. And experience &s;ufficiently confirms the theory.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="180">
FOR, not to repeat all the foregoing in&s;tances: Suppo&s;e, that I were travelling with a companion thro' a country, to which we are both utter &s;tran|gers; it is evident, that, if the pro&s;pects be beau|tiful, the roads agreeable, and the fields finely cultivated; this may &s;erve to put me in good humour, both with my&s;elf and fellow-traveller. But as the country has no connexion with my|&s;elf or friend, it can never be the immediate cau&s;e either of &s;elf-value or of regard to him: And therefore, if I found not the pa&s;&s;ion on &s;ome other object, which bears to one of us a clo&s;er relation, my emotions are rather to be con&s;idered as the overflowings of an elevated or humane di&s;po&s;ition, than as an e&s;tabli&s;hed pa&s;|&s;ion. But &s;uppo&s;ing the agreeable pro&s;pect be|fore us to be &s;urveyed either from his country|&s;eat or from mine; this new connexion of ideas gives a new direction to the &s;entiment of plea|&s;ure, proceeding from the pro&s;pect, and rai&s;es the emotion of regard or vanity, according to the nature of the connexion. There is not here, methinks, much room for doubt or dif|ficulty.</P>

<P N="1">1. IT &s;eems evident, that rea&s;on, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, as meaning the judgment of truth and fal&s;hood, can never, of it&s;elf, be any motive to the will, and can have no influence but &s;o far as it touches &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion or affection. <HI>Ab&s;tract relations</HI> of ideas are the object of curio&s;ity, not of volition. And <HI>matters of fact,</HI> where they are neither good nor evil, where they neither excite de&s;ire nor aver&s;ion, are totally indiffer|ent; and whether known or unknown, whe|ther mi&s;taken or rightly apprehended, cannot be regarded as any motive to action.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT is commonly, in a popular &s;en&s;e, called rea&s;on, and is &s;o much recommended in moral di&s;cour&s;es, is nothing but a general and a calm pa&s;&s;ion, which takes a comprehen&s;ive and di&s;tant view of its object, and actuates the will, without exciting any &s;en&s;ible emotion. A man, we &s;ay, is diligent in his profe&s;&s;ion from rea|&s;on; that is, from a calm de&s;ire of riches and a fortune. A man adheres to ju&s;tice from rea&s;on;
<PB N="171" REF="182">
that is, from a calm regard to a character with him&s;elf and others.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;ame objects, which recommend them&s;elves to rea&s;on in this &s;en&s;e of the word, are al&s;o the objects of what we call pa&s;&s;ion, when they are brought near to us, and acquire &s;ome other advantages, either of external &s;itua|tion, or congruity to our internal temper; and by that means, excite a turbulent and &s;en&s;ible emotion. Evil, at a great di&s;tance, is avoided, we &s;ay, from rea&s;on: Evil, near at hand, pro|duces aver&s;ion, horror, fear, and is the object of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE common error of metaphy&s;icians has lain in a&s;cribing the direction of the will entirely to one of the&s;e principles, and &s;uppo&s;ing the other to have no influence. Men often act knowingly again&s;t their intere&s;t: It is not there|fore the view of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good which always influences them. Men often counteract a violent pa&s;&s;ion, in pro&s;ecution of their di&s;tant intere&s;ts and de&s;igns: It is not therefore the pre|&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s alone, which determines them.
<PB N="172" REF="183">
In general, we may ob&s;erve, that both the&s;e principles operate on the will; and where they are contrary, that either of them prevails, ac|cording to the general character or pre&s;ent di&s;po|&s;ition of the per&s;on. What we call <HI>&s;trength of mind</HI> implies the prevalence of the calm pa&s;&s;ions above the violent; tho' we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that there is no per&s;on &s;o con&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;t of this virtue, as never, on any occa&s;ion, to yield to the &s;ollicitation of violent affections and de|&s;ires. From the&s;e variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning the fu|ture actions and re&s;olutions of men, where there is any contrariety of motives and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P N="1">1. WE &s;hall here enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which render a pa&s;&s;ion calm or violent, which heighten or dimini&s;h any emo|tion.</P>
<P>IT is a property in human nature, that any emotion, which attends a pa&s;&s;ion, is ea&s;ily con|verted into it; tho' in their natures they be originally different from, and even contrary to each other. It is true, in order to cau&s;e a per|fect union among&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, and make one produce the other, there is always required a double relation, according to the theory above delivered. But when two pa&s;&s;ions are already produced by their &s;eparate cau&s;es, and are both pre&s;ent in the mind, they readily mingle and unite; tho' they have but one relation, and &s;ometimes without any. The predominant pa&s;|&s;ion &s;wallows up the inferior, and converts it into it&s;elf. The &s;pirits, when once excited, ea&s;ily receive a change in their direction; and it is natural to imagine, that this change will come from the prevailing affection. The con|nexion
<PB N="174" REF="185">
is in many ca&s;es clo&s;er betwixt any two pa&s;&s;ions, than betwixt any pa&s;&s;ion and indif|ference.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprices of his mi&s;tre&s;s, the jealou&s;ies and quarrels, to which that commerce is &s;o &s;ubject; however unplea&s;ant they be, and rather connected with anger and hatred; are yet found, in many in&s;tances, to give additional force to the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion. It is a common artifice of politicians, when they would affect any per&s;on very much by a matter of fact, of which they intend to inform him, fir&s;t to excite his curio&s;ity; delay as long as po&s;&s;ible the &s;ati&s;|fying it; and by that means rai&s;e his anxiety and impatience to the utmo&s;t, before they give him a full in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s. They know, that his curio&s;ity will precipitate him into the pa&s;&s;ion, which they purpo&s;e to rai&s;e, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t the object in its influence on the mind. A &s;oldier, advancing to battle, is naturally in|&s;pired with courage and confidence, when he thinks on his friends and fellow-&s;oldiers; and is &s;truck with fear and terror, when he reflects on the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore, proceeds from the former naturally encrea&s;es
<PB N="175" REF="186">
the courage; as the &s;ame emotion proceeding from the latter, augments the fear. Hence in martial di&s;cipline, the uniformity and lu&s;tre of habit, the regularity of figures and motions, with all the pomp and maje&s;ty of war, encou|rage our&s;elves and our allies; while the &s;ame objects in the enemy &s;trike terror into us, tho' agreeable and beautiful in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>HOPE is, in it&s;elf, an agreeable pa&s;&s;ion, and allied to friend&s;hip and benevolence; yet is it able &s;ometimes to blow up anger, when that is the predominant pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Spes addita &s;u&s;citat iras.</HI> Virg.</P>
<P N="2">2. SINCE pa&s;&s;ions, however independent, are naturally transfu&s;ed into each other, if they are both pre&s;ent at the &s;ame time; it follows, that when good or evil is placed in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion as to cau&s;e any particular emotion, be&s;ides its direct pa&s;&s;ion of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, that latter pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t acquire new force and violence.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS often happens, when any object excites contrary pa&s;&s;ions. For it is ob&s;ervable,
<PB N="176" REF="187">
that an oppo&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions commonly cau&s;es a new emotion in the &s;pirits and produces more di&s;order than the concurrence of any two affec|tions of equal force. This new emotion is ea&s;ily converted into the predominant pa&s;&s;ion, and in many in&s;tances, is ob&s;erved to encrea&s;e its violence, beyond the pitch, at which it would have arrived, had it met with no oppo&s;ition. Hence we naturally de&s;ire what is forbid, and often take a plea&s;ure in performing actions, merely becau&s;e they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when oppo&s;ite to the pa&s;&s;ions, is not always able to overcome them; and when it fails of that influence, is apt rather to encrea&s;e and irritate them, by producing an oppo&s;ition in our motives and principles.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;ame effect follows, whether the oppo&s;ition ari&s;es from internal motives or ex|ternal ob&s;tacles. The pa&s;&s;ion commonly ac|quires new force in both ca&s;es. The efforts, which the mind makes to &s;urmount the ob&s;tacle, excite the &s;pirits, and enliven the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="177" REF="188">
5. UNCERTAINTY has the &s;ame effect as oppo&s;ition. The agitation of the thought, the quick turns which it makes from one view to another, the variety of pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;ucceed each other, according to the different views: All the&s;e produce an agitation in the mind; and this agitation transfu&s;es it&s;elf into the predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SECURITY, on the contrary, dimini&s;hes the pa&s;&s;ions. The mind, when left to it&s;elf, im|mediately langui&s;hes; and in order to pre&s;erve its ardour, mu&s;t be every moment &s;upported by a new flow of pa&s;&s;ion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, de&s;pair, tho' contrary to &s;ecurity, has a like influence.</P>
<P N="6">6. NOTHING more powerfully excites any affection than to conceal &s;ome part of its object, by throwing it into a kind of &s;hade, which, at the &s;ame time, that it &s;hows enough to prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s us in favour of the object, leaves &s;till &s;ome work for the imagination. Be&s;ides, that ob|&s;curity is always attended with a kind of uncer|tainty; the effort, which the fancy makes to
<PB N="178" REF="189">
compleat the idea, rouzes the &s;pirits, and gives an additional force to the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. As de&s;pair and &s;ecurity, tho' contrary, produce the &s;ame effects; &s;o ab&s;ence is ob&s;erved to have contrary effects, and in different cir|cum&s;tances either encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes our affection. <HI>Roche&s;oucault</HI> has very well remarked, that ab&s;ence de&s;troys weak pa&s;&s;ions, but en|crea&s;es &s;trong; as the wind extingui&s;hes a candle, but blows up a fire. Long ab&s;ence naturally weakens our idea, and dimini&s;hes the pa&s;&s;ion: But where the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o &s;trong and lively as to &s;upport it&s;elf, the unea&s;ine&s;s, ari&s;ing from ab&s;ence, encrea&s;es the pa&s;&s;ion, and gives it new force and influence.</P>
<P N="8">8. WHEN the &s;oul applies it&s;elf to the per|formance of any action, or the conception of any object, to which it is not accu&s;tomed, there is a certain unpliablene&s;s in the faculties, and a difficulty of the &s;pirits moving in their new direction. As this difficulty excites the &s;pirits, it is the &s;ource of wonder, &s;urprize, and of all the emotions, which ari&s;e from novelty;
<PB N="179" REF="190">
and is in it&s;elf very agreeable, like every thing, which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree. But tho' &s;urpri&s;e be agreeable in it&s;elf, yet as it puts the &s;pirits in agitation, it not only aug|ments our agreeable affections, but al&s;o our painful, according to the foregoing principle. Hence every thing, that is new, is mo&s;t affect|ing, and gives us either more plea&s;ure or pain, than what, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;hould naturally fol|low from it. When it often returns upon us, the novelty wears off; the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide; the hurry of the &s;pirits is over; and we &s;urvey the object with greater tranquillity.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE imagination and affections have a clo&s;e union together. The vivacity of the former, gives force to the latter. Hence the pro&s;pect of any plea&s;ure, with which we are acquainted, affects us more than any other plea|&s;ure, which we may own &s;uperior, but of who&s;e nature we are <HI>wholly</HI> ignorant. Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea: The other, we conceive under the general no|tion of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="191">
ANY &s;atisfaction, which we lately enjoyed, and of which the memory is fre&s;h and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than another of which the traces are decayed and al|mo&s;t obliterated.</P>
<P>A PLEASURE, which is &s;uitable to the way of life, in which we are engaged, excites more our de&s;ires and appetites than another, which is foreign to it.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more capable of infu&s;ing any pa&s;&s;ion into the mind, than eloquence, by which objects are repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t lively colours. The bare opinion of another, e&s;pecially when inforced with pa&s;&s;ion, will cau&s;e an idea to have an influence upon us, tho' that idea might otherwi&s;e have been en|tirely neglected.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that lively pa&s;&s;ions com|monly attend a lively imagination. In this re&s;pect, as well as others, the force of the pa&s;|&s;ion depends as much on the temper of the per&s;on, as on the nature or &s;ituation of the object.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="192">
WHAT is di&s;tant, either in place or time, has not equal influence with what is near and contiguous.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not here to have exhau&s;ted this &s;ubject. It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, if I have made it appear, that, in the production and con|duct of the pa&s;&s;ions, there is a certain regular mechani&s;m, which is &s;u&s;ceptible of as accurate a di&s;qui&s;ition, as the laws of motion, optics, hydro&s;tatics, or any part of natural philo&s;ophy.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems an unaccountable plea&s;ure, which the &s;pectators of a well-wrote tragedy re|ceive from &s;orrow, terror, anxiety, and other pa&s;&s;ions, which are in them&s;elves di&s;agreeable and unea&s;y.

If in the texture of the piece, there be interwoven any &s;cenes of &s;atisfaction, they af|ford only faint gleams of plea&s;ure, which are thrown in by way of variety, and in order to plunge the actors into deeper di&s;tre&s;s, by means of that contra&s;t and di&s;appointment.

To get rid of this painful &s;ituation, it &s;eeks every amu&s;ement and pur&s;uit; bu&s;ine&s;s, gam|ing, &s;hows, executions; whatever will rouze the pa&s;&s;ions, and take its attention from it&s;elf. No matter, what the pa&s;&s;ion is: Let it be di&s;|agreeable, afflicting, melancholy, di&s;ordered; it is &s;till better, than that in&s;ipid languor, which ari&s;es from perfect tranquillity and repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196">
IT is impo&s;&s;ible not to admit this account, as being, at lea&s;t, in part &s;atisfactory.

<P>WE find, that common lyars always magnify, in their narrations, all kinds of danger, pain, di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ickne&s;s, deaths, murders, and cruel|ties; as well as joy, beauty, mirth, and mag|nificence.

However we may be hurried away by the &s;pectacle; whatever dominion the &s;en&s;es and imagination may u&s;urp over the rea&s;on, there &s;till lurks at the bottom a certain idea of fal&s;hood in the whole of what we &s;ee. This idea, tho' weak and di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;uffices to di|mini&s;h the pain which we &s;uffer from the misfortunes of tho&s;e whom we love, and to reduce that affliction to &s;uch a pitch as con|verts it into a plea&s;ure. We weep for the misfortune of a hero, to whom we are at|tached: In the &s;ame in&s;tant we comfort our|&s;elves, by reflecting, that it is nothing but a fiction: And it is preci&s;ely, that mixture of &s;entiments, which compo&s;es an agreeable &s;orrow, and tears that delight us. But as that affliction, which is cau&s;ed by exterior and &s;en&s;ible objects, is &s;tronger than the con|&s;olation, which ari&s;es from an internal re|flection, they are the effects and &s;ymptoms of &s;orrow, which ought to prevail in the compo&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;olution &s;eems ju&s;t and convincing; but perhaps it wants &s;till &s;ome new addition, in order to make it an&s;wer fully the phaenomenon,
<PB N="190" REF="199">
which we here examine. All the pa&s;&s;ions, ex|cited by eloquence, are agreeable in the highe&s;t degree, as well as tho&s;e which are moved by painting and the theatre. The epilogues of <HI>Ci|cero</HI> are, on this account chiefly, the delight of every reader of ta&s;te; and it is difficult to read &s;ome of them without the deepe&s;t &s;ympathy and &s;orrow. His merit as an orator, no doubt, de|pends much on his &s;ucce&s;s in this particular. When he had rai&s;ed tears in his judges and all his audience, they were then the mo&s;t highly delighted, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction with the pleader. The pathetic de&s;cription of the butchery made by <HI>Verres</HI> of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> cap|tains is a ma&s;ter-piece of this kind: But I be|lieve none will affirm, that the being pre&s;ent at a melancholy &s;cene of that nature would afford any entertainment. Neither is the &s;orrow here &s;oftened by fiction: For the audience were con|vinced of the reality of every circum&s;tance. What is it then, which in this ca&s;e rai&s;es a plea|&s;ure from the bo&s;om of unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;o to &s;peak; and a plea&s;ure, which &s;till retains all the features and outward &s;ymptoms of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow?</P>
<P>I ANSWER: This extraordinary effect pro|ceeds from that very eloquence, with which the
<PB N="191" REF="200">
melancholy &s;cene is repre&s;ented. The genius required to paint objects in a lively manner, the art employed in collecting all the pathetic cir|cum&s;tances, the judgment di&s;played in di&s;po&s;ing them; the exerci&s;e, I &s;ay, of the&s;e noble ta|lents, along with the force of expre&s;&s;ion, and beauty of oratorial numbers, diffu&s;e the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction on the audience, and excite the mo&s;t delightful movements. By this means, the un|ea&s;ine&s;s of the melancholy pa&s;&s;ions is not only overpowered and effaced by &s;omething &s;tronger of an oppo&s;ite kind; but the whole movement of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions is converted into plea&s;ure, and &s;wells the delight, which the eloquence rai&s;es in us. The &s;ame force of oratory, employed on an unintere&s;ting &s;ubject, would not plea&s;e half &s;o much, or rather would appear altogether ri|diculous; and the mind, being left in ab&s;olute calmne&s;s and indifference, would reli&s;h none of tho&s;e beauties of imagination or expre&s;&s;ion, which, if joined to pa&s;&s;ion, give it &s;uch exqui|&s;ite entertainment. The impul&s;e or vehemence, ari&s;ing from &s;orrow, compa&s;&s;ion, indignation, receives a new direction from the &s;entiments of beauty. The latter, being the predominant emotions, &s;eize the whole mind, and convert the former into them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t, tincture
<PB N="192" REF="201">
them &s;o &s;trongly as totally to alter their nature: And the &s;oul, being, at the &s;ame time, rouzed by pa&s;&s;ion, and charmed by eloquence, feels on the whole a &s;trong movement, which is alto|gether delightful.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle takes place in tragedy; along with this addition, that tragedy is an imitation, and imitation is always of it&s;elf agreeable. This circum&s;tance &s;erves &s;till farther to &s;mooth the motions of pa&s;&s;ion, and convert the whole feeling into one uniform and &s;trong en|joyment. Objects of the greate&s;t terror and di&s;tre&s;s plea&s;e in painting, and plea&s;e more than the mo&s;t beautiful objects, that appear calm and indifferent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Painters make no &s;cruple of repre&s;enting di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow as well as any other pa&s;&s;ion: But they &s;eem not to dwell &s;o much on the&s;e melancholy affections as the poets, who, tho' they copy every emotion of the human brea&s;t, yet pa&s;s very quickly over the agreeable &s;entiments. A painter repre&s;ents only one in&s;tant; and if that be pa&s;&s;ionate enough, it is &s;ure to affect and delight the &s;pectator: But nothing can furni&s;h to the poet a variety of &s;cenes and incidents and &s;entiments, except di&s;tre&s;s, terror, or anxiety. Compleat joy and &s;atisfaction is attended with &s;ecurity, and leaves no farther room for action.</NOTE>. The affection, rouzing the mind, excites a large &s;tock of &s;pirit and vehemence; which is all transformed into plea&s;ure by the force of the prevailing movement. It is thus
<PB N="193" REF="202">
the fiction of tragedy &s;oftens the pa&s;&s;ion, by an infu&s;ion of a new feeling, not merely by weaken|ing or dimini&s;hing the &s;orrow. You may by degrees weaken a real &s;orrow, till it totally di&s;|appears; yet in none of its gradations will it ever give plea&s;ure; except, perhaps, by accident, to a man &s;unk under lethargic indolence, whom it rouzes from that languid &s;tate.</P>
<P>To confirm this theory, it will be &s;uffi|cient to produce other in&s;tances, where the &s;ubordinate movement is converted into the pre|dominant, and gives force to it, tho' of a dif|ferent, and even &s;ometimes tho' of a contrary nature.</P>
<P>NOVELTY naturally excites the mind and attracts our attention; and the movements, which it cau&s;es, are always converted into any pa&s;&s;ion, belonging to the object, and join their force to it. Whether an event excites joy or &s;orrow, pride or &s;hame, anger or good|will, it is &s;ure to produce a &s;tronger affection, when new and unu&s;ual. And tho' novelty, of it&s;elf, be agreeable, it enforces the painful, as well as agreeable pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

HAD you any intention to move a per&s;on extremely by the narration of any event, the be&s;t method of encrea&s;ing its effect would be artfully to delay informing him of it, and fir&s;t excite his curio&s;ity and impatience before you let him into the &s;ecret. This is the artifice, practiced by <HI>Iago</HI> in the famous &s;cene of <HI>Shake&s;peare;</HI> and every &s;pectator is &s;en&s;ible, that <HI>Othello's</HI> jealou&s;y acquires additional force from his preceding impatience, and that the &s;ubordinate pa&s;&s;ion is here readily transformed into the predominant.</P>

<P>THESE in&s;tances (and many more might be collected) are &s;ufficient to afford us &s;ome in&s;ight into the analogy of nature, and to &s;how us, that the plea&s;ure, which poets, orators, and mu&s;i|cians give us, by exciting grief, &s;orrow, indig|nation, compa&s;&s;ion, is not &s;o extraordinary nor paradoxical, as it may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear. The force of imagination, the energy of expre&s;|&s;ion, the power of numbers, the charms of imitation; all the&s;e are naturally, of them&s;elves, delightful to the mind; and when the object pre&s;ented lays al&s;o hold of &s;ome affection, the plea&s;ure &s;till ri&s;es upon us, by the conver&s;ion of this &s;ubordinate movement, into that which is predominant.

<P>TO confirm this rea&s;oning, we may ob&s;erve, that if the movements of the imagination be not predominant above tho&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion, a con|trary effect follows; and the former, being now &s;ubordinate, is converted into the latter, and &s;till farther encrea&s;es the pain and affliction of the &s;ufferer.</P>

<P>AN action, repre&s;ented in tragedy, may be too bloody and atrocious. It may excite &s;uch movements of horror as will not &s;often into plea&s;ure; and the greate&s;t energy of expre&s;&s;ion be&s;towed on de&s;criptions of that nature &s;erves only to augment our unea&s;ine&s;s.

<P>EVEN the common &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion require to be &s;oftened by &s;ome agreeable af|fection, in order to give a thorough &s;atisfaction to the audience. The mere &s;uffering of plain|tive virtue, under the triumphant tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of vice, forms a di&s;agreeable &s;pec|tacle, and is carefully avoided by all ma&s;ters of the theatre.

<P>MOST painters appear in this light to have been very unhappy in their &s;ubjects.

<HI>Ovid,</HI> who&s;e fictions, tho' pa&s;&s;ionate and agree|able, are &s;carce natural or probable enough for painting.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame inver&s;ion of that principle, which is here in&s;i&s;ted on, di&s;plays it&s;elf in common life, as in the effects of oratory and poetry.

<HEAD>DISSERTATION IV. Of the Standard of Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>THE great variety of Ta&s;tes, as well as of opinions, which prevail in the world, is too obvious not to have fallen under every one's ob|&s;ervation. Men of the mo&s;t confined knowledge are able to remark a difference in the narrow cir|cle of their acquaintance, even where the per&s;ons have been educated under the &s;ame government, and have early imbibed the &s;ame prejudices. But tho&s;e who can enlarge their view to contemplate di&s;tant nations and remote ages, are &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed at the great incon&s;i&s;tence and con|tradiction. We are apt to call <HI>barbarous</HI> what|ever departs widely from our own ta&s;te and ap|prehen&s;ion: But &s;oon find the epithet of reproach retorted on us. And the highe&s;t arrogance and &s;elf conceit is at la&s;t &s;tartled, on ob&s;erving an equal a&s;&s;urance on all &s;ides, and &s;cruples, amid&s;t &s;uch a conte&s;t of &s;entiments, to pronounce po|&s;itively in its own favour.</P>
<P>As this variety of ta&s;te is obvious to the mo&s;t carele&s;s enquirer; &s;o will it be found, on exami|nation,
<PB N="204" REF="212">
to be &s;till greater in reality than in ap|pearance. The &s;entiments of men often differ with regard to beauty and deformity of all kinds, even while their general di&s;cour&s;e is the &s;ame. There are certain terms in every language, which import blame, and others prai&s;e; and all men, who u&s;e the &s;ame tongue, mu&s;t agree in their application of them. Every voice is united in applauding elegance, propriety, &s;implicity, &s;pirit in writing; and in blaming fu&s;tian, affectation, coldne&s;s, and a fal&s;e brilliant: But when critics come to particulars, this &s;eeming unanimity va|ni&s;hes; and it is found, that they had affixed a very different meaning to their expre&s;&s;ions. In all matters of opinion and &s;cience, the ca&s;e is op|po&s;ite: The difference among men is there oftner found to lie in generals than in particulars; and to be le&s;s in reality than in appearance. An explica|tion of the terms commonly ends the contro|ver&s;y; and the di&s;putants are &s;urprized to find, that they had been quarrelling, while at bottom they agreed in their judgment.</P>
<P>THOSE who found morality on &s;entiment, more than on rea&s;on, are inclined to comprehend ethics under the former ob&s;ervation, and to &s;up|po&s;e, that in all que&s;tions, which regard conduct
<PB N="205" REF="213">
and manners, the difference among men is really greater than at fir&s;t fight it appears. It is indeed obvious, that writers of all nations and all ages concur in applauding ju&s;tice, humanity, mag|nanimity, prudence, veracity; and in blaming the oppo&s;ite qualities. Even poets and other au|thors, who&s;e compo&s;itions are chiefly calculated to plea&s;e the imagination, are yet found, from <HI>Homer</HI> down to <HI>Fenelon,</HI> to inculcate the &s;ame moral precepts, and to be&s;tow their applau&s;e and blame on the &s;ame virtues and vices. This great unanimity is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the influ|ence of plain rea&s;on; which, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, maintains &s;imilar &s;entiments in all men, and pre|vents tho&s;e controver&s;ies, to which the ab&s;tract &s;ciences are &s;o much expo&s;ed. So far as the unanimity is real, the account may be admitted as &s;atisfactory: But it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed, that &s;ome part of the &s;eeming harmony in morals may be accounted for from the very nature of lan|guage. The word, <HI>virtue,</HI> with its equivalent in every tongue, implies prai&s;e; as that of <HI>vice</HI> does blame: And no one, without the mo&s;t ob|vious and gro&s;&s;e&s;t impropriety, could affix re|proach to a term, which in general u&s;e is un|der&s;tood in a good &s;en&s;e; or be&s;tow applau&s;e, where the idiom requires di&s;approbation. <HI>Homer's</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="214">
general precepts, where he delivers any &s;uch, will never be controverted; but it is very ob|vious, that when he draws particular pictures of manners, and repre&s;ents heroi&s;m in <HI>Achilles</HI> and prudence in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> he intermixes a much greater degree of ferocity in the former, and of cunning and fraud in the latter, than <HI>Fenelon</HI> would admit of. The &s;age <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> poet &s;eems to delight in lies and fictions, and often employs them without any nece&s;&s;ity or even advantage: But his more &s;crupulous &s;on in the <HI>French</HI> epic writer expo&s;es him&s;elf to the mo&s;t imminent perils, rather than depart from the exacte&s;t line of truth and veracity.</P>
<P>THE admirers and followers of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in&s;i&s;t very much on the excellent moral precepts, which are inter&s;per&s;ed throughout that wild per|formance. But it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Arabic</HI> words, which corre&s;pond to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> equity, ju&s;tice, temperance, meekne&s;s, charity, were &s;uch as, from the con&s;tant u&s;e of that tongue, mu&s;t always be taken in a good &s;en&s;e; and it would have argued the greate&s;t ignorance, not of morals, but of language, to have men|tioned them with any epithets, be&s;ides tho&s;e of applau&s;e and approbation. But would we know,
<PB N="207" REF="215">
whether the pretended prophet had really at|tained a ju&s;t &s;entiment of morals? Let us attend to his narration; and we &s;hall &s;oon find, that he be&s;tows prai&s;e on &s;uch in&s;tances of treachery, in|humanity, cruelty, revenge, bigotry, as are utterly incompatible with civilized &s;ociety. No &s;teddy rule of right &s;eems there to be attended to; and every action is blamed or prai&s;ed, &s;o far only as it is beneficial or hurtful to the true believers.</P>
<P>THE merit of delivering true general precepts in ethics is indeed very &s;mall. Whoever recom|mends any moral virutes, really does no more than is implied in the terms them&s;elves. The people, who invented the word <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> and u&s;ed it in a good &s;en&s;e, inculcated more clearly and much more efficaciou&s;ly, the precept, <HI>be mo|de&s;t,</HI> than any pretended legi&s;lator or prophet, who &s;hould in&s;ert &s;uch a <HI>maxim</HI> in his writings. Of all expre&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e, which, together with their other meaning, imply a degree either of blame or approbation, are the lea&s;t liable to be perverted or mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>It is very natural for us to &s;eek a <HI>Standard of Ta&s;te;</HI> a rule, by which the various &s;entiments of men may be reconciled; or at lea&s;t, a de|ci&s;ion
<PB N="208" REF="216">
afforded, confirming one &s;entiment, and condemning another.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, which cuts off all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch an attempt, and repre&s;ents the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever attaining any &s;tandard of ta&s;te. The difference, it is &s;aid, is very wide between judgment and &s;entiment. All &s;entiment is right; becau&s;e &s;entiment has a re|ference to nothing beyond it&s;elf, and is always real, wherever a man is con&s;cious of it. But all determinations of the under&s;tanding are not right; becau&s;e they have a reference to &s;ome|thing beyond them&s;elves, to wit, real matter of fact; and are not always conformable to that &s;tandard. Among a thou&s;and different opinions which different men amy entertain of the &s;ame &s;ubject, there is one, and but one, that is ju&s;t and true; and the only difficulty is to fix and a&s;certain it. On the contrary, a thou&s;and diffe|rent &s;entiments, excited by the &s;ame object, are all right: Becau&s;e no &s;entiment repre&s;ents what is really in the object. It only marks a certain conformity or relation betwixt the object and the organs or faculties of the mind; and if that conformity did not really exi&s;t, the &s;entiment could never po&s;&s;ibly have a being. Beauty is no
<PB N="209" REF="217">
quality in things them&s;elves: It exi&s;ts merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One per&s;on may even perceive deformity, where another is &s;en&s;ible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquie&s;ce in his own &s;entiment, without pre|tending to regulate tho&s;e of others. To &s;eek the real beauty, or real deformity is as fruitle&s;s an enquiry, as to pretend to a&s;certain the real &s;weet or real bitter. According to the di&s;po&s;ition of the organs, the &s;ame object may be both &s;weet and bitter; and the proverb has ju&s;tly deter|mined it to be fruitle&s;s to di&s;pute concerning ta&s;tes. It is very natural, and even quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to extend this axiom to mental, as well as bodily ta&s;te; and thus common &s;en&s;e, which is &s;o often at variance with philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially with the &s;ceptical kind, is found, in one in&s;tance at lea&s;t, to agree in pronouncing the &s;ame de|ci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT though this axiom, by pa&s;&s;ing into a proverb, &s;eems to have attained the &s;anction of common &s;en&s;e; there is certainly a &s;pecies of common &s;en&s;e which oppo&s;es it, or at lea&s;t &s;erves to modify and re&s;train it. Whoever would a&s;&s;ert an equality of genius and elegance betwixt
<PB N="210" REF="218">
<HI>Ogilby</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> or <HI>Bunyan</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> would be thought to defend no le&s;s an extrava|gance, than if he had maintained a molehill to be as high as <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> or a pond as exten&s;ive as the ocean. Though there may be found per|&s;ons, who give the preference to the former au|thors; no one pays attention to &s;uch a ta&s;te; and we pronounce without &s;cruple the &s;entiment of the&s;e pretended critics to be ab&s;urd and ridi|culous. The principle of the natural equality of ta&s;tes is then totally forgot; and while we ad|mit of it on &s;ome occa&s;ions, where the objects &s;eem near an equality, it appears an extravagant paradox, or rather a palpable ab&s;urdity, where objects &s;o di&s;proportioned are compared together.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that none of the rules of com|po&s;ition are fixed by rea&s;onings <HI>a priori,</HI> or can be e&s;teemed ab&s;tract conclu&s;ions of the under|&s;tanding, from comparing tho&s;e habitudes and relations of ideas, which are eternal and im|mutable. Their foundation is the &s;ame with that of all the practical &s;ciences, experience; nor are they any thing but general ob&s;ervations, concerning what has been univer&s;ally found to plea&s;e in all countries and in all ages. Many of the beauties of poetry and even of eloquence
<PB N="211" REF="219">
are founded on fal&s;hood and fiction, on hyper|boles, metaphors, and an abu&s;e or perver&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ions from their natural meaning. To check the &s;allies of the imagination, and to re|duce every expre&s;&s;ion to geometrical truth and exactne&s;s, would be the mo&s;t contrary to the laws of critici&s;m; becau&s;e it would produce a work, which, by univer&s;al experience has been found the mo&s;t in&s;ipid and di&s;agreeable. But though poetry can never &s;ubmit to exact truth, it mu&s;t be confined by rules of art, di&s;covered to the author either by genius or ob&s;ervation. If &s;ome negligent or irregular writers have plea&s;ed, they have not plea&s;ed by their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of rule or order, but in &s;pite of the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: They have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other beauties, which were conformable to ju&s;t critici&s;m; and the force of the&s;e beauties has been able to overpower cen|&s;ure, and give the mind a &s;atisfaction &s;uperior to the di&s;gu&s;t ari&s;ing from the blemi&s;hes. <HI>Ario&s;to</HI> plea&s;es; but not by his mon&s;trous and impro|bable fictions, by his bizarre mixture of the &s;e|rious and comic &s;tyles, by the want of coherence in his &s;tories, or by the continual interruptions of his narration. He charms by the force and clearne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ion, by the readine&s;s and variety of his inventions, and by his natural
<PB N="212" REF="220">
pictures of the pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the gay and amorous kind: And however his faults may dimini&s;h our &s;atisfaction, they are not able entirely to de&s;troy it. Did our plea&s;ure really ari&s;e from tho&s;e parts of his poem, which we de|nominate faults, this would be no objection to critici&s;m in general: It would only be an ob|jection to tho&s;e particular rules of critici&s;m, which would e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch circum&s;tances to be faults, and would repre&s;ent them as univer&s;ally blameable. If they are found to plea&s;e, they cannot be faults; let the plea&s;ure, which they produce, be ever &s;o unexpected and unac|countable.</P>
<P>BUT though all the general rules of art are founded only on experience and on the ob&s;erva|tion of the common &s;entiments of human nature, we mu&s;t not imagine, that, on every occa&s;ion, the feelings of men will be conformable to the&s;e rules. Tho&s;e finer emotions of the mind are of a very tender and delicate nature, and require the concurrence of many favourable cir|cum&s;tances to make them play with facility and exactne&s;s, according to their general and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed principles. The lea&s;t exterior hindrance to &s;uch &s;mall &s;prings, or the lea&s;t internal di&s;|order,
<PB N="213" REF="221">
di&s;turbs their motion, and confounds the operation of the whole machine. When we would make an experiment of this nature, and would try the force of any beauty or deformity, we mu&s;t choo&s;e with care a proper time and place, and bring the fancy to a &s;uitable &s;ituation and di&s;po&s;ition. A perfect &s;erenity of mind, a recollection of thought, a due attention to the object; if any of the&s;e circum&s;tances be wanting our experiment will be fallacious, and we &s;hall be unable to judge of the catholic and univer&s;al beauty. The relation, which nature has placed betwixt the form and the &s;entiment, will at lea&s;t be more ob&s;cure; and it will require greater accuracy to trace and di&s;cern it. We &s;hall be able to a&s;certain its influence not &s;o much from the operation of each particular beauty, as from the durable admiration, which attends tho&s;e works, that have &s;urvived all the caprices of mode and fa&s;hion, all the mi&s;takes of ignorance and envy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame <HI>Homer,</HI> who plea&s;ed at <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> two thou&s;and years ago, is &s;till admired at <HI>Paris</HI> and at <HI>London.</HI> All the changes of climate, government, religion, and language have not been able to ob&s;cure his glory. Au|thority
<PB N="214" REF="222">
or prejudice may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator; but his reputation will never be durable or general. When his com|po&s;itions are examined by po&s;terity or by fo|reigners, the enchantment is di&s;&s;ipated, and his faults appear in their true colours. On the con|trary, a real genius, the longer his works endure, and the more wide they are &s;pread, the more &s;incere is the admiration which he meets with. Envy and jealou&s;y have too much place in a narrow circle; and even familiar acquaintance with his per&s;on may dimini&s;h the applau&s;e due to his performances: But when the&s;e ob&s;tructions are removed, the beauties, which are naturally fitted to excite agreeable &s;entiments immediately di&s;play their energy; and while the world en|dures, they maintain their authority over the minds of men.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that amid&s;t all the variety and caprices of ta&s;te, there are certain general principles of approbation or blame, who&s;e in|fluence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind. Some particular forms or qualities, from the original &s;tructure of the internal fabric, are calculated to plea&s;e, and others to di&s;plea&s;e; and if they fail of their effect in any particular
<PB N="215" REF="223">
in&s;tance, it is from &s;ome apparent defect or im|perfection in the organ. A man in a fever would not in&s;i&s;t on his palate as able to decide con|cerning flavours; nor would one, affected with the jaundice, pretend to give a verdict with re|gard to colours. In each creature, there is a &s;ound and a defective &s;tate; and the former alone can be &s;uppo&s;ed to afford us a true &s;tandard of ta&s;te and &s;entiment. If in the &s;ound &s;tate of the organs, there be an entire or a con&s;iderable uni|formity of &s;entiment among men, we may thence derive an idea of the perfect and uni|ver&s;al beauty; in like manner as the appearance of objects in day-light to the eye of a man in health is denominated their true and real colour, even while colour is allowed to be merely a phanta&s;m of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>MANY and frequent are the defects in the in|ternal organs, which prevent or weaken the in|fluence of tho&s;e general principles, on which de|pends our &s;entiment of beauty or deformity. Though &s;ome objects, by the &s;tructure of the mind, be naturally calculated to give plea&s;ure, it is not to be expected, that in every individual the plea&s;ure will be equally felt. Particular in|cidents and &s;ituations occur, which either throw
<PB N="216" REF="224">
a fal&s;e light on the objects, or hinder the true from conveying to the imagination the proper &s;entiment and perception.</P>
<P>ONE obvious cau&s;e, why many feel not the proper &s;entiment of beauty, is the want of that <HI>delicacy</HI> of imagination, which is requi&s;ite to convey a &s;en&s;ibility of tho&s;e finer emotions. This delicacy every one pretends to: Every one talks of it; and would reduce every kind of ta&s;te or &s;entiment to its &s;tandard. But as our inten|tion in this di&s;&s;ertation is to mingle &s;ome light of the under&s;tanding with the feelings of &s;entiment, it will be proper to give a more accurate defi|nition of delicacy, than has hitherto been at|tempted. And not to draw our philo&s;ophy from too profound a &s;ource, we &s;hall have re|cour&s;e to a noted &s;tory in <HI>Don Quixote.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS with good rea&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Sancho</HI> to the &s;quire with the great no&s;e, that I pretend to have a judgment in wine: This is a quality heredi|tary in our family. Two of my kin&s;men were once called to give their opinion of a hog&s;head, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be excellent, being old and of a good vintage. One of them ta&s;tes it; con&s;iders it, and after mature reflection pro|nounces
<PB N="217" REF="225">
the wine to be good, were it not for a &s;mall ta&s;te of leather, which he perceived in it. The other, after u&s;ing the &s;ame precautions, gives al&s;o his verdict in favour of the wine; but with the re&s;erve of a ta&s;te of iron, which he could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h. You cannot imagine how much they were both ridiculed for their judgment. But who laughed in the end? On emptying the hog&s;head, there was found at the bottom, an old key with a leathern thong tied to it.</P>
<P>THE great re&s;emblance between mental and bodily ta&s;te will ea&s;ily teach us to apply this &s;tory. Though it be certain, that beauty and deformity, no more than &s;weet and bitter, are not qualities in objects, but belong entirely to the &s;entiment, internal or external; it mu&s;t be allowed, that there are certain qualities in objects, which are fitted by nature to produce tho&s;e particular feel|ings. Now as the&s;e qualities may be found in a &s;mall degree or may be mixt and confounded with each other, it often happens, that the ta&s;te is not affected with &s;uch minute qualities, or is not able to di&s;tingui&s;h all the particular flavours, amid&s;t the di&s;order, in which they are pre&s;ented. Where the organs are &s;o fine, as to allow nothing
<PB N="218" REF="226">
to e&s;cape them; and at the &s;ame time &s;o exact as to perceive every ingredient in the compo&s;i|tion: This we call delicacy of ta&s;te, whether we employ the&s;e terms in the natural or meta|phorical &s;en&s;e. Here then the general rules of beauty are of u&s;e; being drawn from e&s;tabli&s;hed models, and from the ob&s;ervation of what plea&s;es or di&s;plea&s;es, when pre&s;ented &s;ingly and in a high degree: And if the &s;ame qualities, in a conti|nued compo&s;ition and in a &s;maller degree, affect not the organs with a &s;en&s;ible delight or unea&s;i|ne&s;s, we exclude the per&s;on from all preten&s;ions to this delicacy. To produce the&s;e general rules or avowed patterns of compo&s;ition is like finding the key with the leathern thong; which ju&s;tified the verdict of <HI>Sancho's</HI> kin&s;men, and confounded tho&s;e pretended judges, who had condemned them. Though the hog&s;head had never been emptied, the ta&s;te of the one was &s;till equally delicate, and that of the other equally dull and languid: But it would have been more difficult to have proved the &s;uperiority of the former, to the conviction of every by-&s;tander. In like manner, though the beauties of writing had never been methodized, or reduced to gene|ral principles; though no excellent models had ever been acknowledged; the different degrees
<PB N="219" REF="227">
of ta&s;te would &s;till have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and the judg|ment of one man been preferable to that of ano|ther; but it would not have been &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ilence the bad critic, who might always in&s;i&s;t upon his particular &s;entiment, and refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to his antagoni&s;t. But when we &s;how him an avowed principle of art; when we illu&s;trate this principle by examples, who&s;e operation, from his own particular ta&s;te, he acknowledges to be conform|able to the principle; when we prove, that the &s;ame principle may be applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where he did not perceive nor feel its in|fluence: He mu&s;t conclude, upon the whole, that the fault lies in him&s;elf, and that he wants the delicacy, which is requi&s;ite to make him &s;en&s;ible of every beauty and every blemi&s;h, in any com|po&s;ition or di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis acknowledged to be the perfection of every &s;en&s;e or faculty, to perceive with exactne&s;s its mo&s;t minute objects, and allow nothing to e&s;cape its notice and ob&s;ervation. The &s;maller the objects are, which become &s;en&s;ible to the eye, the finer is that organ, and the more ela|borate its make and compo&s;ition. A good palate is not tried by &s;trong flavours; but by a mixture of &s;mall ingredients, where we are &s;till &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="220" REF="228">
of each part, notwith&s;tanding its minutene&s;s and its confu&s;ion with the re&s;t. In like manner, a quick and acute perception of beauty and defor|mity mu&s;t be the perfection of our mental ta&s;te, nor can a man be &s;atisfied with him&s;elf, while he &s;u&s;pects, that any excellence or blemi&s;h in a di&s;cour&s;e has pa&s;&s;ed him unob&s;erved. In this ca&s;e, the perfection of the man, and the perfec|tion of the &s;en&s;e or feeling, are found to be united. A very delicate palate, on many occa&s;ions, may be a great inconvenience both to a man him&s;elf and to his friends; but a delicate ta&s;te of wit or beauty mu&s;t always be a de&s;irable quality; be|cau&s;e it is the &s;ource of all the fine&s;t and mo&s;t innocent enjoyments, of which human nature is &s;u&s;ceptible. In this deci&s;ion, the &s;entiments of all mankind are agreed. Wherever you can fix or a&s;certain a delicacy of ta&s;te, it is &s;ure to be approved of; and the be&s;t way of fixing it is to appeal to tho&s;e models and principles, which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the uniform approbation and experience of nations and ages.</P>
<P>BUT though there be naturally a very wide difference in point of delicacy between one per&s;on and another, nothings tends further to encrea&s;e and improve this talent, than <HI>practice</HI> in a par|ticular
<PB N="221" REF="229">
art, and the frequent &s;urvey or contem|plation of a particular &s;pecies of beauty. When objects of any kind are fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the eye or imagination, the &s;entiment, which attends them, is ob&s;cure and confu&s;ed: and the mind is, in a great mea&s;ure, incapable of pronouncing concerning their merits or defects. The ta&s;te cannot perceive the &s;everal excellencies of the performance; much le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h the parti|cular character of each excellency, and a&s;cer|tain its quality and degree. If it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or deformed 'tis the utmo&s;t which can be expected; and even this judgment a per&s;on, &s;o unpracti&s;ed, will be apt to deliver with great he&s;itation and re|&s;erve. But allow him to acquire experience in tho&s;e objects, his feeling becomes more exact and nice: He not only perceives the beauties and defects of each part, but marks the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing &s;pecies of each quality, and a&s;&s;igns it &s;uitable prai&s;e or blame. A clear and di&s;tinct &s;entiment attends him through the whole &s;urvey of the objects; and he di&s;cerns that very de|gree and kind of aaprobation or di&s;plea&s;ure, which each part is naturally fitted to produce. The mi&s;t di&s;&s;ipates, which &s;eemed formerly to hang over the object: The organ acquires
<PB N="222" REF="230">
greater perfection in its operations; and can pro|nounce, without danger of mi&s;take, concerning the merits of each performance. In a word, the &s;ame addre&s;s and dexterity, which practice gives to the execution of any work, is al&s;o ac|quired, by the &s;ame means, in the judging of it.</P>
<P>So advantageous is practice to the di&s;cernment of beauty, that before we can pronounce judg|ment on any work of importance, it will even be requi&s;ite, that that very individual perform|ance be more than once peru&s;ed by us, and be &s;urveyed in different lights, with attention and deliberation. There is a flutter or hurry of thought, which attends the fir&s;t peru&s;al of any piece, and which confounds the genuin &s;enti|ment of beauty. The reference of the parts is not di&s;cerned: The true characters of &s;tyle are little di&s;tingui&s;hed: The &s;everal perfections and defects &s;eem wrapped up in a &s;pecies of confu|&s;ion, and pre&s;ent them&s;elves indi&s;tinctly to the imagination. Not to mention, that there is a &s;pecies of beauty, which, as it is florid and &s;u|perficial, plea&s;es at fir&s;t; but being found incom|patible with a ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion either of rea&s;on or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;oon palls upon the ta&s;te, and is then re|jected with di&s;dain, at lea&s;t rated at a much lower value.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="231">
IT is impo&s;&s;ible to continue in the practice of contemplating any order of beauty, without being frequently obliged to form <HI>compari&s;ons</HI> between the &s;everal &s;pecies and degrees of excellency, and e&s;timating their proportion to each other. A man, who has had no opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beauty, is indeed totally un|qualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object pre&s;ented to him. By compari&s;on alone we fix the epithets of prai&s;e or blame, and learn how to a&s;&s;ign the due degree of each. The coar&s;e&s;t dawbing of a &s;ign-po&s;t contains a cer|tain lu&s;tre of colours and exactne&s;s of imitation, which are &s;o far beauties, and would affect the mind of a pea&s;ant or Indian with the highe&s;t ad|miration. The mo&s;t vulgar ballads are not en|tirely de&s;titute of harmony or nature; and none but a per&s;on, familiarized to &s;uperior beauties, would pronounce their numbers har&s;h, or narra|tion unintere&s;ting. A great inferiority of beauty gives pain to a per&s;on conver&s;ant in the highe&s;t excellency of the kind, and is for that rea&s;on pronounced a deformity: As the mo&s;t fini&s;hed object, with which we are acquainted, is natu|rally &s;uppo&s;ed to have reached the pinnacle of perfection, and to be entitled to the highe&s;t ap|plau&s;e.
<PB N="224" REF="232">
A man who has had opportunities of &s;eeing, and examining, and weighing the &s;everal performances, admired in different ages and na|tions, can alone rate the merits of a work exhi|bited to his view, and a&s;&s;ign its proper rank among the productions of genius.</P>
<P>BUT to enable him the more fully to execute this undertaking, he mu&s;t pre&s;erve his mind free from all <HI>prejudice,</HI> and allow nothing to enter into his con&s;ideration, but the very object, which is &s;ubmitted to his examination. We may ob&s;erve, that every work of art, in order to produce its due effect on the mind, mu&s;t be &s;urveyed in a certain point of view, and cannot be fully re|li&s;hed by per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;ituation, real or imagi|nary, is not conformable to that required by the performance. An orator addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to a particular audience, and mu&s;t have a regard to their particular genius, intere&s;ts, opinions, pa&s;|&s;ions, and prejudices; otherwi&s;e he hopes in vain to govern their re&s;olutions, and inflame their affections. Should they even have entertained &s;ome prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t him, however unrea|&s;onable, he mu&s;t not overlook this di&s;advantage; but before he enters upon the &s;ubject, mu&s;t en|deavour to conciliate their affection, and acquire
<PB N="225" REF="233">
their good graces. A critic of a different age or nation, who &s;hould peru&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e, mu&s;t have all the&s;e circum&s;tances in his eye, and mu&s;t place him&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation as the audi|ence, in order to form a true judgment of the oration. In like manner, when any work is ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the public, though I &s;hould have a friend&s;hip or enmity with the author, I mu&s;t de|part from this particular &s;ituation; and con&s;ider|ing my&s;elf as a man in general, forget, if po&s;&s;i|ble, my individual being and my peculiar cir|cum&s;tances. A per&s;on, influenced by prejudice, complies not with this condition; but ob&s;tinately maintains his natural po&s;ition, without entering into that required by the performance. If the work be addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons of a different age or nation, he makes no allowance for their peculiar views and prejudices; but full of the manners of his own times, ra&s;hly condemns what &s;eemed ad|mirable in the eyes of tho&s;e for whom alone the di&s;cour&s;e was calculated. If the work be executed for the public, he never &s;ufficiently enlarges his comprehen&s;ion, or forgets his intere&s;ts as a friend or enemy, as a rival or commentator. By this means, his &s;entiments are perverted; nor have the &s;ame beauties and blemi&s;hes the &s;ame influ|ence upon him, as if he had impo&s;ed a proper
<PB N="226" REF="234">
violence on his imagination, and had forgot him|&s;elf for a moment. So far his ta&s;te evidently departs from the true &s;tandard; and of con&s;e|quence lo&s;es all credit and authority.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that, in all que&s;tions, &s;ub|mitted to the under&s;tanding, prejudice is mo&s;t de&s;tructive of &s;ound judgment, and perverts all operations of the intellectual faculties: It is no le&s;s contrary to good ta&s;te; nor has it le&s;s influ|ence to corrupt our &s;entiments of beauty. It be|longs to <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> to check its influence in both ca&s;es; and in this re&s;pect, as well as in many others, rea&s;on, if not an e&s;&s;ential part of ta&s;te, is at lea&s;t requi&s;ite to the operations of this latter faculty. In all the nobler productions of genius, there is a mutual relation and corre&s;pondence of parts; nor can either the beauties or blemi&s;hes be perceived by him, who&s;e thought is not ca|pacious enough to comprehend all tho&s;e parts, and compare them with each other, in order to perceive the con&s;i&s;tence and uniformity of the whole. Every work of art has al&s;o a certain end or purpo&s;e, for which it is calculated; and is to be deemed more or le&s;s perfect, as it is more or le&s;s fitted to attain this end. The object of eloquence is to per&s;uade, of hi&s;tory to in&s;truct, of poetry to
<PB N="227" REF="235">
plea&s;e by means of the pa&s;&s;ions and the imagi|nation. The&s;e ends we mu&s;t carry con&s;tantly in our view, when we peru&s;e any performance; and we mu&s;t be able to judge how far the means employed are adapted to their re&s;pective purpo&s;es. Be&s;ides, every kind of compo&s;ition, even the mo&s;t poetical, is nothing but a chain of propo&s;i|tions and rea&s;onings; not always indeed the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t exact, but &s;till plau&s;ible and &s;pecious, however di&s;gui&s;ed by the colouring of the imagination. The per&s;ons, introduced in tragedy and epic poetry, mu&s;t be repre&s;ented as rea&s;oning and thinking, and concluding and acting, &s;uitable to their characters and circum|&s;tances; and without judgment, as well as ta&s;te and invention, a poet can never hope to &s;ucceed in &s;o delicate an undertaking. Not to mention, that the &s;ame excellence of faculties which con|tributes to the improvement of rea&s;on, the &s;ame clearne&s;s of conception, the &s;ame exactne&s;s of di&s;tinction, the &s;ame vivacity of apprehen&s;ion, are e&s;&s;ential to the operations of true ta&s;te, and are its infallible concomitants. It &s;eldom, or never hap|pens, that a man of &s;en&s;e, who has experience in any art, cannot judge of its beauty; and it is no le&s;s rare to meet with a man, who has a ju&s;t ta&s;te, without a &s;ound under&s;tanding.</P>

THUS, though the principles of ta&s;te be uni|ver&s;al, and nearly, if not entirely the &s;ame in all men; yet few are qualified to give judgment on any work of art, or e&s;tabli&s;h their own &s;entiment as the &s;tandard of beauty. The organs of inter|nal &s;en&s;ation are &s;eldom &s;o perfect as to allow the general principles their full play, and pro|duce a feeling corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e principles. They either labour under &s;ome defect, or are vitiated by &s;ome di&s;order; and by that means, excite a &s;entiment, which may be pronounced erroneous. When the critic has no delicacy, he judges without any di&s;tinction, and is only affected by the gro&s;&s;er and more palpable qualities of the object: The finer touches pa&s;s unnoticed and di&s;regarded. Where he is not aided by practice, his verdict is attended with confu&s;ion and he&s;itation. Where no compari&s;on has been employed, the mo&s;t frivolous beauties, &s;uch as rather merit the name of defects, are the objects of his admiration. Where he lies under the in|fluence of prejudice, all his natural &s;entiments are perverted. Where good &s;en&s;e is wanting, he is not qualified to di&s;cern the beauties of de|&s;ign and rea&s;oning, which are the highe&s;t and mo&s;t excellent. Under &s;ome or other of the&s;e
<PB N="229" REF="237">
imperfections, the generality of men labour; and hence a true judge in the finer arts is ob|&s;erved, even during the mo&s;t poli&s;hed ages, to be &s;o rare a character: Strong &s;en&s;e, united to delicate &s;entiment, improved by practice, per|fected by compari&s;on, and cleared of all preju|dice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of &s;uch, where|ever they are to be found, is the true &s;tandard of ta&s;te and beauty.</P>
<P>BUT where are &s;uch critics to be found? By what marks are they to be known? How di|&s;tingui&s;h them from pretenders? The&s;e que|&s;tions are embarra&s;&s;ing; and &s;eem to throw us back into the &s;ame uncertainty, from which, during the cour&s;e of this di&s;&s;ertation, we have endeavoured to extricate our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT if we con&s;ider the matter aright, the&s;e are que&s;tions of fact, not of &s;entiment. Whe|ther any particular per&s;on be endowed with good &s;en&s;e and a delicate imagination, free from pre|judice, may often be the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and be liable to great di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and enquiry: But that &s;uch a character is valuable and e&s;timable will be agreed by all mankind. Where the&s;e
<PB N="230" REF="238">
doubts occur, men can do no more than in other di&s;putable que&s;tions, which are &s;ubmitted to the under&s;tanding: They mu&s;t produce the be&s;t ar|guments, which their invention &s;ugge&s;ts to them; they mu&s;t acknowledge a true and deci&s;ive &s;tan|dard to exi&s;t &s;omewhere, to wit, real exi&s;tence and matter of fact; and they mu&s;t have indul|gence to &s;uch as differ from them in their ap|peals to this &s;tandard. It is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, if we have proved, that the ta&s;te of all individuals is not upon an equal footing, and that &s;ome men in general, however difficult to be particularly pitched upon, will be acknowledged by univer&s;al &s;entiment to have a preference above others.</P>
<P>BUT in reality the difficulty of finding, even in particulars, the &s;tandard of ta&s;te, is not &s;o great as is repre&s;ented. Though in &s;peculation, we may readily avow a certain criterion in &s;ci|ence and deny it in &s;entiment, the matter is found in practice to be much more hard to a&s;certain in the former ca&s;e than in the latter. Theories of ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, &s;y&s;tems of profound theology have prevailed during one age: In a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive period, the&s;e have been univer&s;ally exploded: Their ab&s;urdity has been detected: Other theo|ries
<PB N="231" REF="239">
and &s;y&s;tems have &s;upplied their place, which again gave way to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: And nothing has been experienced more liable to the revolu|tions of chance and fa&s;hion than the&s;e pretended deci&s;ions of &s;cience. The ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with the beauties of eloquence and poetry. Ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion and nature are &s;ure, after a little time, to gain public vogue, which they maintain for ever. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Epi|curus</HI> and <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> may &s;ucce&s;&s;ively yield to each other: But <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> maintain an univer&s;al, undi&s;puted empire over the minds of men. The ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy of <HI>Cicero</HI> has lo&s;t its credit: The vehemence of his oratory is &s;till the object of our admiration.</P>
<P>THOUGH men of delicate ta&s;te are rare, they are ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;ociety, by the &s;oundne&s;s of their under&s;tanding and the &s;upe|riority of their faculties above the re&s;t of man|kind. The a&s;cendant, which they acquire, gives a prevalence to that lively approbation, with which they receive any productions of genius, and renders it generally predominant. Many men, when left to them&s;elves, have but a &s;aint and dubious perception of beauty, who yet are capable of reli&s;hing any fine &s;troke, which is pointed out to them. Every convert to the ad|miration
<PB N="232" REF="240">
of the true poet or orator is the cau&s;e of &s;ome new conver&s;ion. And though prejudices may prevail for a time, they never unite in cele|brating any rival to the true genius, but yield at la&s;t to the force of nature and ju&s;t &s;entiment. And thus though a civilized nation may ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken in the choice of their admired philo&s;o|pher, they never have been found long to err in their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all our endeavours to-fix a &s;tandard of ta&s;te, and reconcile the various ap|prehen&s;ions of men, there &s;till remain two &s;ources of variation, which, tho' they be not &s;ufficient to confound all the boundaries of beauty and de|formity, will often &s;erve to vary the degrees of our approbation or blame. The one is the diffe|rent humours of particular men; the other, the particular manners and opinions of our age and country. The general principles of ta&s;te are uni|form in human nature: Where men vary in their judgments, &s;ome defect or perver&s;ion in the faculties may commonly be remarked; pro|ceeding either from prejudice, from want of practice, or want of delicacy; and there is ju&s;t rea&s;on for approving one ta&s;te and condemning another. But where there is &s;uch a diver&s;ity in the internal frame or external &s;ituation as is en|tirely
<PB N="233" REF="241">
blamele&s;s on both &s;ides, and leaves no room to give one the preference above the other; in that ca&s;e a certain diver&s;ity of judgment is un|avoidable, and we &s;eek in vain for a &s;tandard, by which we can reconcile the contrary &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>A young man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are warm, will be more &s;en&s;ibly touched with amorous and ten|der images, than a man more advanced in years who takes plea&s;ure in wi&s;e and philo&s;ophical pre|fections concerning the conduct of life and mo|deration of the pa&s;&s;ions. At twenty, <HI>Ovid</HI> may be the favourite author; <HI>Horace</HI> at forty; and perhaps <HI>Tacitus</HI> at fifty. Vainly would we, in &s;uch ca&s;es, endeavour to enter into the &s;enti|ments of others, and dive&s;t our&s;elves of tho&s;e propen&s;ities, which are natural to us. We chu&s;e our favourite author as we do our friend, from a conformity of humours and di&s;po&s;itions. Mirth or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;entiment or reflection; which ever of the&s;e mo&s;t predominates in our temper, it gives us a peculiar &s;ympathy with the writer, who re&s;embles us.</P>
<P>ONE per&s;on is more plea&s;ed with the &s;ublime; another with the tender; a third with raillery. One has a &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility to blemi&s;hes, and is extremely &s;tudious of correctne&s;s: Another has
<PB N="234" REF="242">
a more lively feeling of beauties, and pardons twenty ab&s;urdities and defects for one elevated or pathetic &s;troke. The ear of this man is en|tirely turned towards conci&s;ene&s;s and energy; that man is delighted with a copious, rich, and harmonious expre&s;&s;ion. Simplicity is affected by one; ornament by another. Comedy, tragedy, &s;atire, odes have each their partizans, who pre|&s;er that particular &s;pecies of writing to all others. It is plainly an error in a critic to confine his ap|probation to one &s;pecies or &s;tyle of writing and condemn all the re&s;t. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to feel a predilection for that which &s;uits our particular turn and di&s;po&s;ition. Such preferences are innocent and unavoidable, and can never rea|&s;onably be the object of di&s;pute, becau&s;e there is no &s;tandard, by which they can be decided.</P>
<P>For a like rea&s;on, we are more plea&s;ed with pictures of characters, which re&s;emble &s;uch as are found in our own age or country, than with tho&s;e which de&s;cribe a different &s;et of cu&s;toms. 'Tis not without &s;ome effort, that we reconcile our&s;elves to the &s;implicity of antient manners, and behold prince&s;&s;es drawing water from a &s;pring, and kings and heroes dre&s;&s;ing their own victuals. We may allow in general, that the re|pre&s;entation of &s;uch manners is no fault in the author, nor deformity in the piece; but we are
<PB N="235" REF="243">
not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touched with them. For this rea&s;on, comedy is not transferred ea&s;ily from one age or nation to another. A <HI>Frenchman</HI> or <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI> is not plea&s;ed with the <HI>Andria</HI> of <HI>Terence,</HI> or <HI>Clitia</HI> of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> where the fine lady, upon whom all the play turns, never once appears to the &s;pectators, but is always kept behind the &s;cenes, &s;uitable to the re&s;erved humour of the antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and modern <HI>Italians.</HI> A man of learning and reflection can make allowance for the&s;e peculiarities of manners; but a common audience can never dive&s;t them&s;elves &s;o far of their u&s;ual ideas and &s;entiments as to reli&s;h pic|tures which no way re&s;emble them.</P>
<P>AND here there occurs a reflection, which may, perhaps, be u&s;eful in examining the cele|brated controver&s;y concerning antient and mo|dern learning; where we often find the one &s;ide excu&s;ing any &s;eeming ab&s;urdity in the antients from the manners of the age, and the others re|fu&s;ing to admit this excu&s;e, or at lea&s;t, admit|ting it only as an apology for the author, not for the performance. In my opinion, the pro|per bounds in this &s;ubject have &s;eldom been fixed between the contending parties. Where any in|nocent peculiarities of manners are repre&s;ented, &s;uch as tho&s;e abovementioned, they ought cer|tainly
<PB N="236" REF="244">
to be admitted; and a man who is &s;hocked with them, gives an evident proof of fal&s;e deli|cacy and refinement. The poets <HI>monument more durable than bra&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t fall to the ground like common brick or clay, were men to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of man|ners and cu&s;toms, and would admit nothing but what was &s;uitable to the prevailing fa&s;hion. Mu&s;t we throw a&s;ide the pictures of our ance&s;tors, becau&s;e of their ruffs and fardingales? But where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another, and where vicious manners are de&s;cribed, without being marked with the proper characters of blame and di&s;approbation; this mu&s;t be allowed to disfigure the poem, and to be a real deformity. I cannot, nor is it proper I &s;hould, enter into &s;uch &s;entiments; and however I may excu&s;e the poet, on account of the manners of his age, I never can reli&s;h the compo&s;ition. The want of humanity and of decency, &s;o con|&s;picuous in the characters drawn by &s;everal of the antient poets, even &s;ometimes by <HI>Homer</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> tragedians, dimini&s;hes con&s;idera|bly the merit of their noble performances, and gives modern authors a great advantage over them. We are not intere&s;ted in the fortunes and &s;entiments of &s;uch rough heroes: We are di&s;plea&s;ed to find the limits of vice and virtue &s;o
<PB N="237" REF="245">
confounded: And whatever indulgence we may give the writer on account of his prejudices, we cannot prevail on our&s;elves to enter into his &s;en|timents, or bear an affection to characters, which we plainly di&s;cover to be blameable.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with moral princi|ples as with &s;peculative opinions of any kind. The&s;e are in continual flux and revolution. The &s;on embraces a different &s;y&s;tem from the father. Nay, there &s;carce is any man, who can boa&s;t of great con&s;tancy and uniformity in this particular. Whatever &s;peculative errors may be found in the polite writings of any age or country, they de|tract but little from the value of tho&s;e compo&s;i|tions. There needs but a certain turn of thought or imagination to make us enter into all the opi|nions, which then prevailed, and reli&s;h the &s;en|timents or conclu&s;ions derived from them. But a very violent effort is requi&s;ite to change our judgment of manners, and excite &s;entiments of approbation or blame, love or hatred, different from tho&s;e to which the mind from long cu&s;tom has been familiarized. And where a man is con|fident of the rectitude of that moral &s;tandard, by which he judges, he is ju&s;tly jealous of it, and will not pervert the &s;entiments of his heart for a mo|ment, in complai&s;ance to any writer whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="246" MS="y">
OF all &s;peculative errors, tho&s;e which regard religion, are the mo&s;t excu&s;able in compo&s;itions of genius; nor is it ever permitted to judge of the civility or wi&s;dom of any people, or even of &s;ingle per&s;ons, by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s or refinement of their theological principles. The &s;ame good &s;en&s;e, that directs men in the ordinary occur|rences of life, is not hearkened to in religious matters, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be placed en|tirely above the cognizance of human rea&s;on. Upon this account, all the ab&s;urdities of the pa|gan &s;y&s;tem of theology mu&s;t be overlooked by every critic, who would pretend to form a ju&s;t notion of antient poetry; and our po&s;terity, in their turn, mu&s;t have the &s;ame indulgence to their forefathers. No religious principles can ever be imputed as a fault to any poet, while they remain merely principles, and take not &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, as to lay him under the imputation of <HI>bigotry</HI> or <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI> Where that happens, they confound the &s;entiments of morality and alter the natural boundaries of vice and virtue. They are therefore eternal blemi&s;hes, according to the principle abovementioned; nor are the prejudices and fal&s;e opinions of the age &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="247">
'Tis e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Roman</HI> catholic religion to in&s;pire a violent hatred to every other wor&s;hip, and repre&s;ent all pagaus, mahometans, and he|retics as the objects of divine wrath and venge|ance. Such &s;entiments, though they are in reality extremely blameable, are con&s;idered as virtues by the zealots of that communion, and are re|pre&s;ented in their tragedies and epic poems as a kind of divine heroi&s;m. This bigotry has disfi|gured two very fine tragedies of the <HI>French</HI> thea|tre, <HI>Polieucte</HI> and <HI>Athalia;</HI> where an intemperate zeal for particular modes of wor&s;hip is &s;et off with all the pomp imaginable, and forms the predominant character of the heroes. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What is this,"</Q> &s;ays the heroic <HI>Joad</HI> to <HI>Jo&s;abet,</HI> finding her in di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Mattan,</HI> the prie&s;t of <HI>Baal,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Does the daughter of <HI>David</HI> &s;peak to this traitor? Are you not afraid, left the earth &s;hould open and pour forth flames to devour you both? Or that the&s;e holy walls &s;hould fall and cru&s;h you together? What is his purpo&s;e? Why comes that enemy of God hither to poi|&s;on the air, which we breath, with his horrid pre&s;ence?"</Q> Such &s;entiments are received with great applau&s;e on the theatre of <HI>Paris;</HI> but at <HI>London</HI> the &s;pectators would be full as much plea&s;ed to hear <HI>Achilles</HI> tell <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> that he
<PB N="240" REF="248">
was a dog in his forehead and a deer in his heart, or <HI>Jupiter</HI> threaten <HI>Juno</HI> with a &s;ound drubbing, if &s;he will not be quiet.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS principles are al&s;o a blemi&s;h in any polite compo&s;ition, when they ri&s;e up to &s;u|per&s;tition, and intrude them&s;elves into every &s;entiment, however remote from any connection with religion. 'Tis no excu&s;e for the poet, that the cu&s;toms of his country had burthened life with &s;o many religious ceremonies and ob&s;er|vances, that no part of it was exempt from that yoak. It mu&s;t be for ever ridiculous in <HI>Petrarch</HI> to compare his mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Laura,</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Nor is it le&s;s ridiculous in that agreeable liber|tine, <HI>Boccace,</HI> very &s;eriou&s;ly to give thanks to God Almighty, and the ladies, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in de&s;ending him again&s;t his enemies.</P>
