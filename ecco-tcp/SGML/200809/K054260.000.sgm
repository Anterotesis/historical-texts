<L>THOU, to who&s;e &s;acred page the parting gue&s;t</L>
<L>Confides the workings of his grateful brea&s;t,</L>
<L>With awful plea&s;ure o'er thy form I bend</L>
<L>My gift to bring&mdash;as brother, gue&s;t, and friend.</L>
<L>Farewell, ye &s;hades! (ah! not to fame unknown)</L>
<L>Where Elegance has rear'd her attic throne:</L>
<L>Who&s;e beauties, to the pure of ta&s;te addre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>In Nature's charms munificently dre&s;s'd;</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oft amenity, with grace combin'd,</L>
<L>Di&s;play the emblem of the ma&s;ter's mind:</L>
<L>Farewell!&mdash;Say, &s;hall I not regret the bow'r</L>
<L>Where &s;ocial intercour&s;e endear'd the hour;</L>

<L>By native Ta&s;te, that &s;ure directre&s;s, led,</L>

<L>So the bright Sun-flow'r, on the cultur'd plain,</L>
<L>A&s;pires impatient o'er her &s;i&s;ter train,</L>
<L>Unfolds her bo&s;om at the dawn of day</L>

<L>Ye &s;cenes o'er which I ca&s;t a ling'ring view,</L>
<L>O'er which affection breathes a warm adieu,</L>
<L>That hour I now recall with plea&s;ing pain,</L>
<L>Which gave your beauties to my wi&s;h again:</L>
<L>Yet then, as I approach'd your &s;miling &s;hore,</L>
<L>Prompt expectation gladly flew before:</L>
<L>Wing'd with gay hope, as nearer &s;till I drew,</L>
<L>Hills, plains, and woods a&s;&s;um'd a brighter hue:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">
Soft-wreath'd in lilac ve&s;tment, laughing May</L>
<L>With hailing a&s;pect met me on the way:</L>
<L>The various vale with eager &s;teps I pre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Prai&s;e on my tongue, and tran&s;port in my brea&s;t:</L>
<L>O'er each lov'd &s;pot I &s;ent a fond &s;urvey,</L>
<L>Where in the morn of life I wont to &s;tray;</L>
<L>The winding walks by memory endear'd,</L>
<L>Where with the growing plants my youth was rear'd,</L>
<L>Embow'ring &s;hades, in who&s; deep gloom immers'd</L>
<L>Reflection fed me, and the mu&s;es nurs'd,</L>
<L>And, &s;creening from my view ambition's &s;ky,</L>

<L>Yet, Album, ere the willing ta&s;k I leave,</L>
<L>Warm from the heart the&s;e clo&s;ing lines receive.</L>
<L>'Twas at the hour to contemplation due,</L>
<L>When evening meekly from the world withdrew,</L>
<L>Beneath an aged oak, in pen&s;ive mood,</L>
<L>I Sorrow's &s;olitary captive &s;tood;</L>

When, from the rifted trunk's ob&s;cure rece&s;s,</L>

<L>The branches &s;hook, as if to &s;en&s;e allied;</L>
<L>Wild Terror flung his &s;trong enchantment round,</L>
<L>And evening hurried into night profound!</L>
</LG>

<L>Now fond remembrance turns a willing &s;ight,</L>
<L>To dwell on gayer &s;cenes of pa&s;t delight,</L>

<L>With grace, with dignity, her part &s;u&s;tain.</L>
<L>To mild fe&s;tivity by nature prone,</L>
<L>With inbred with peculiarly her own,</L>

Who (marking well her &s;en&s;e with &s;trength combin'd,</L>

<L>With brilliant Sevign&eacute; inwreathe her name.</L>

<LG>
<L>To di&s;content, the vice of age, unknown,</L>
<L>Her chearfulne&s;s maintain'd its envied throne:</L>
<L>The gay, the old, the learned, and the young,</L>
<L>And they who&s;e heart pure elegance had &s;trung,</L>
