<Q><L>Of all comforts I mi&s;carried,</L>
<L>When I play'd the fool and married.</L></Q>
<P>THESE, Caroline, are the &s;entiments you have &s;o often heard me mo&s;t melo|diou&s;ly warble forth, indeed with tears in my eyes&mdash;but I retract&mdash;I now ble&s;s the hour in which I became a wife, and look back to it with <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as much heartfelt joy as on that happy one, in which I be|came a widow&mdash;You are amazed&mdash;but
<PB N="4" REF="3">'tis a fact&mdash;and &s;o great is my friend&s;hip for you, that in &s;pite of my pre&s;ent <HI>afflic|tion</HI> I was determined you &s;hould receive the joyful intelligence from my&s;elf before my eyes were &s;o totally de&s;troyed with weeping, as to put it out of my power&mdash;Behold me then a widow, my old &s;oul of a hu&s;band comfortably and quietly laid in his grave&mdash;can you figure to your|&s;elf a happier creature? <HI>I</HI> cannot. Young, hand&s;ome, rich&mdash;my own mi&s;tre&s;s, thank heaven! I cannot once more &s;ay, "the world is all before me&mdash;where to choo&s;e, as well as what to choo&s;e." Ambition has had its turn. I have &s;een my error; of matrimony too I have had a &s;ufficient do&s;e; 'twas a bitter one, but I am am|ply rewarded for my fortitude in &s;wal|lowing it; it has produced the mo&s;t &s;alu|tary effects; what they are I have told you above, and now I can truly &s;ay, with the &s;pirited Eloi&s;a,
<Q><L>Not Cae&s;ar's empre&s;s would I deign to prove,</L>
<L>No, make me mi&s;tre&s;s to the man I love.</L></Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e unfettered &s;entiments have I not rea&s;on to look forward with tran&s;port? Believe me, I do, and impatiently long
<PB N="5" REF="4">to begin a new cour&s;e of life; what the pa&s;t has been, you pretty well know; but what is to follow? Aye, child, that, take my word for it, &s;hall be quite on a different plan. Will you come and be witne&s;s to it? Say the word, a female companion is not ami&s;s, if I could meet with one according to my own ideas, and as &s;uch, I think you would &s;uit me ex|tremely well; my <HI>late poor dear hu&s;band's</HI> apartments are at your &s;ervice; come and occupy them, if the propo&s;al meets your approbation&mdash;think of what I have &s;aid, and in the intervening time I will think of more important matters.</P>
<P>You never beheld mortal &s;o ravi&s;hingly hand&s;ome as I look in my fables; the very few fellows I have &s;een &s;ince the glorious day I fir&s;t figured in them, are all expir|ing, and &s;wear I ought to be &s;hut up in mere charity; but I have no &s;uch de|&s;ign, believe me&mdash;however, I am on the point of bidding the dear creatures adieu for awhile; the town is almo&s;t de&s;erted, and I am on the wing for the country; 'tis rather unlucky this unexpected event did not take place the beginning of win|ter, but one mu&s;t endeavour to be con|tent;
<PB N="6" REF="5">'tis better late than never. My villa is a paradi&s;e, and in a genteel and chearful neighbourhood, and were it not, I have the vanity to believe, my attrac|tions would draw it a &s;ufficient number of admirers, the only &s;ociety likely to afford me con&s;olation in my pre&s;ent <HI>me|lancholy</HI> &s;tate&mdash;To you, you &s;ee, I have freely opened my heart, but do not there|fore fancy I have &s;o little of the hypo|crite in my di&s;po&s;ition as to appear to the world in my true colours. No, no, that would never do, though I believe in my con&s;cience, were every woman to &s;peak her &s;entiments as freely as I have done, mine would not be found very &s;ingular; what think you? But &s;ince 'tis the cu&s;|tom to wear a ma&s;k, I &s;hall not take off mine 'till others &s;et me the example.&mdash;Adieu, let me hear from you, and tell me what you think of my propo&s;al; ac|cept it freely, if 'tis agreeable to you, and whether or not, believe me,</P>

<P>YOUR congratulations, dear Caro|line, found me ju&s;t arrived here, but I had &s;o many matters to arrange on my fir&s;t coming, (being now the &s;ole propri|etor) that I could not find time to ac|quaint you with it before. I admit your rea&s;ons, for not at pre&s;ent accepting my offer, are weighty, but con&s;e&s;s I am &s;orry you had <HI>any</HI> to refu&s;e it, as I find I wi&s;h for you infinitely more now, when con|vinced I cannot have your company, than before; this is a true da&s;h of the female, you'll allow: but I never a&s;pired to be any thing better&mdash;that is to &s;ay, than exactly &s;uch a female as I am; 'tis true, there are beings who figure under that appellation, who do no great credit to it; mere milk and water compo&s;itions, who an&s;wer no earthly purpo&s;e in life except to fill up the &s;pace in which they vegetate, and fifty &s;uch have I already been pe&s;tered with &s;ince I came into the country, for I have received vi&s;its of con|dolence
<PB N="8" REF="7">from every &s;oul twenty miles round, and what is wor&s;e, have been obliged to return them, not to mention being al&s;o compelled to &s;ettle my fea|tures in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable to my outward garb; under this re&s;traint, you may believe, I made them as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, to the no &s;mall mortification of &s;ome, and no le&s;s joy of others; the fir&s;t cla&s;s, you may gue&s;s, are males; the latter, their wives, &s;i&s;ters, daughters, nieces, &amp;c. the&s;e naturally felt &s;ome un|plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations on &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;o greatly eclip&s;ed, and trembled for the effects my &s;uperior charms might pro|duce on their hu&s;bands, lovers, and &s;o forth; and indeed not without cau&s;e, as every unprejudiced &s;pectator mu&s;t ac|knowledge.</P>
<P>As decency does not permit me at pre|&s;ent, to grace any of their balls, either private or public, I am rather at a lo&s;s for amu&s;ement, but &s;hall very &s;oon emerge; the mo&s;t rigidly &s;crupulous mu&s;t acquit me of all indecorum, if, at the expiration of &s;ix tedious months, I ven|ture to appear among&s;t them; and thank my &s;tars four of the &s;ix are over&mdash;in the mean while, I pa&s;s much of my time on
<PB N="9" REF="8">hor&s;e-back, con&s;cious no woman ever ex|celled me in the accompli&s;hment of rid|ing, or looked half &s;o captivating in a habit; black, of all others too, by far the mo&s;t becoming; my haunts are di&s;|covered, though I affect the mo&s;t retired &s;pots, and generally meet half the fel|lows in the neighbourhood prancing there, in hopes to get a peep at the enchanting widow; if a bow, or how do ye, &s;hould be graciou&s;ly given to their peep, they look &s;o delighted, &s;o elate, that it would charm you to &s;ee them. I have not yet beheld the happy man who &s;tands the &s;malle&s;t chance of being honoured, with my more particular notice, but flatter my&s;elf the time is not far di&s;tant, as I hear we are &s;oon to have a regiment of dragoons quartered in this part of the country; and as I have a partiality for a red coat, &s;hall look out among&s;t them for an object on whom to be&s;tow my &s;miles; it will be hard if, out of the whole corps, I cannot find one worthy that enviable di&s;tinction, or who may at lea&s;t &s;erve to flirt with, and amu&s;e me during the &s;um|mer. That over, my dear Caroline, away I fly on the wings of plea&s;ing expetation, to the &s;eat of dear delight, London, where

<P>I TOLD you a regiment was expected; they are arrived; but, my dear Caro|line, how &s;hall I de&s;cribe to you, with ju&s;tice, the charms of their bewitching commander? The elegant, the enchant|ing, and I feel, I may add, the <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible</HI> Lord Sommerville&mdash;yes, irre&s;i&s;tible, I repeat, for I have a &s;trong pre&s;entiment, he cannot a&s;k any favour I &s;hall have either fortitude or <HI>inclination</HI> to deny him; nay, &s;hould he even talk of matrimony, horrid as the &s;ubject would &s;ound to me from any other, I vow, I think I could li&s;ten to him with plea&s;ure; &s;urely <HI>that</HI> is &s;aying enough.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">I happened to be taking my u&s;ual air|ing on hor&s;eback the morning my Lord made his fir&s;t appearance at the head of his regiment, and met them in a road near the entrance of the town, which being rather narrow, I was obliged to &s;top my hor&s;e and place my&s;elf clo&s;e to the &s;ide, that they might pa&s;s without in|commoding me: my Ro&s;inante had not been accu&s;tomed to things of this nature, and was a good deal &s;tartled at the drums, mu&s;ic, colours, &amp;c. This, however, gave me an opportunity to &s;hew my &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip, but great as it is, I found it no ea&s;y matter to prevent his taking a leap with me over the hedge, in order to e&s;cape from a &s;cene that did not de|light him quite &s;o much as his mi&s;tre&s;s: I kept my &s;eat, however, pretty well, in &s;pite of his prancing, for &s;ome time, but ju&s;t as the blooming Sommerville appeared, whether &s;truck with his &s;uperior attrac|tions, or tho&s;e of the beautiful creature he rode, but certain it is, he gave a &s;ud|den &s;pring, and I being off my guard was in an in&s;tant thrown pro&s;trate at the feet of my hero. Since he was to play me this trick, he certainly cho&s;e the moment mo&s;t <HI>a-propos.</HI> I need not tell you, I pre|&s;ume,
<PB N="12" REF="11">I found my&s;elf in&s;tantaneou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed to the bo&s;om of the gallant, the enchanting Sommerville: half a hun|dred of the dear creatures now left their ranks and flew to offer me their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;aid a thou&s;and gallant things of cour&s;e; but I had no eyes, no ears for any except my charming deliverer, who appeared not a little delighted, at being the fortunate he, who had fir&s;t flown to my relief.</P>
<P>It is now time to tell you, I received no other injury than the lo&s;s of my heart; and as I wi&s;hed only for a proper object to be&s;tow it on, I ble&s;&s;ed the accident which had thus procured me one &s;o per|fectly to my ta&s;te. Being at length re|placed on my &s;addle, I would have bid him adieu, after expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude, and &s;o forth; but this his Lord&s;hip would by no means allow; he in&s;i&s;ted on my giving him permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee me &s;afe home. Could I, Caroline, refu&s;e? Hav|ing ordered the regiment to halt, away we rode in full review, all eyes fixed upon us, and not a few conjectures form|ed, I pre&s;ume, by tho&s;e we left behind.</P>
<P>It was during the cour&s;e of this delight|ful bu&s;tle, I happily learned the name and rank of my conqueror, though had he
<PB N="13" REF="12">been the lowe&s;t &s;ubaltern of the corps, his charms would have produced no le&s;s effect; and greater is impo&s;&s;ible, for I ab|&s;olutely adore him, and &s;o would you, could you get one &s;ingle glance of his en|chanting figure; for it is not merely the fine&s;t face in the world, it is his per&s;on&mdash;his manners&mdash;his language, the expre&s;|&s;ion in his eyes, in &s;hort it is Sommervile altogether.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;and pray, you impertinently a&s;k, does my Lord appear as &s;en&s;ible of your Lady&s;hip's charms as you are avow|edly of his? <HI>Impertinently,</HI> I &s;ay,&mdash;for what can be more &s;o than to doubt it? Have I not already told you, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every po&s;&s;ible perfection? Of cour&s;e <HI>ta&s;te</HI> to make proper di&s;tinctions mu&s;t be of the number.&mdash;Yes yes, my dear I have the vanity to believe our pa&s;&s;ion is mu|tual&mdash;we are already on the mo&s;t delight|ful footing, for you are not to imagine this is an affair of ye&s;terday; no, my good friend, my time and thoughts were for the fir&s;t ten days too happily employ|ed to think of writing, nor would you now have been thus favoured had he not been ab&s;ent; pray now, you cry, is this the fir&s;t moment he has left you then,
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;ince the adventure happened?&mdash;Why no, not ab&s;olutely&mdash;though it is pretty nearly the ca&s;e&mdash;it would delight you could you be a witne&s;s to the envy this affair has given birth to in every female brea&s;t in the country&mdash;No doubt a da&s;h of &s;candal to accompany it, for they ge|nerally are of the &s;ame party; but you know me too well to believe this will &s;it very heavy on my heart; let the dear creatures vent their &s;pleen in any way mo&s;t likely to relieve their gentle bo&s;oms, with all my &s;oul. My Sommerville and I look down upon them with eyes of pity from the &s;ummit of our felicity;&mdash;do not mi&s;take me, however, Caroline&mdash;Matters are not <HI>yet quite</HI> &s;o far arranged between us as you may probably take it into your head to fancy&mdash;my &s;entiments have un|dergone a total revolution &s;ince I became acquainted with him. Matrimony, of which I had &s;o ju&s;tly formed &s;uch hor|rid ideas, does not, when I think of my Sommerville in character of a hu&s;band, &s;hock me quite &s;o much as it formerly did&mdash;I begin to fancy it might be bearable with him. I have made many very &s;e|rious reflections on the &s;ubject; the re|&s;ult is&mdash;I know not exactly&mdash;but, in

<HEAD>LETTER IV. <HI>Lord Sommerville to Charles Dalton, E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Colche&s;ter.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have not forgot, I pre&s;ume, Charles, how piou&s;ly I cur&s;ed my &s;tars for being compelled to join my regiment, at the moment I hoped to have brought matters to bear in a certain <HI>affaire de coeur,</HI> which for &s;ome time wholly engro&s;&s;ed me&mdash;how far my hopes were well founded remains to be proved. Vanity &s;ays <HI>well</HI>&mdash;but be that as it will, 'tis no longer in my power to proceed in it&mdash;here I am di&s;tant fifty long miles from the fair ob|ject of my pur&s;uit, &s;o &s;he is &s;afe for the pre&s;ent; and I, in the mean time, mu&s;t endeavour to con&s;ole my&s;elf the be&s;t way I can. Nature has formed me of a mo&s;t happy di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;uch as every &s;ol|dier
<PB N="16" REF="15">ought to be compo&s;ed of, &s;ince our motions are &s;o very uncertain.</P>
<P>You know in what humour I drank my farewell bottle with you at Brookes's; in pretty much the &s;ame I began my march to the&s;e quarters; nor would it have been much improved yet, I believe, but for an adventure which I am now going to in|form you of in few words, for I hate long|winded &s;tories, nor am I very good at the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>We had arrived within a &s;mall &s;pace of our de&s;tined quarters, and were marching to drums beating, colours flying, mu&s;ic playing, &amp;c. in order to make our fir&s;t appearance with proper <HI>eclat,</HI> when, be|hold, in a narrow lane, through which we were obliged to pa&s;s, a fair creature on hor&s;e-back, attended by a couple of &s;er|vants in mourning, (&s;he too in a habit of the &s;ame &s;able hue, which &s;et off her charms to the highe&s;t advantage,) met us as we were flouri&s;hing along&mdash;&s;he &s;top|ped her hor&s;e, fearing, perhaps, he might be a little unruly; and &s;o it happened, for ju&s;t as I came up, &s;he could no longer govern him, he &s;tarted, &s;he fell, and I, Charles, had the good fortune to quit mine time enough to catch her in my
<PB N="17" REF="16">arms, almo&s;t before &s;he reached the ground&mdash;on a nearer view I was &s;truck motionle&s;s by her charms; &s;uch a face, &s;uch an elegance of per&s;on, and &s;uch a pair of wicked &s;parkling eyes, mine never before encountered&mdash;at that moment I as much forgot Maria as if no &s;uch dear creature exi&s;ted; the betwitching Lady Stanley (for that is the title of my new flame) has mo&s;t effectually done her bu|&s;ine&s;s and mine too&mdash;&s;he has nothing far|ther to fear from my per&s;ecution, as &s;he u&s;ed to call it, Charles. The le&s;s cruel Arabella, &s;hall, nay, has driven her image from my brea&s;t, and has &s;upplied its place by her own.</P>
<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;een this lady, heard of her you certainly mu&s;t, &s;ince her marriage with that old dotard Lord Stan|ley made &s;o much noi&s;e, that even I heard of it though at that time in America&mdash;She was the daughter of a citizen, who, for the &s;ake of having a Lord for his &s;on|-in-Law, gave her and twenty-thou&s;and pounds to a fellow old enough to be her grandfather; <HI>&s;he</HI> had been ble&s;&s;ed with a <HI>modern education,</HI> which accounts for her accepting &s;uch a hu&s;band. About &s;ix months ago &s;he had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing
<PB N="18" REF="17">him laid in his coffin, but not till he had &s;ettled on her two thou&s;and a-year jointure&mdash;her grief is not &s;o violent but it will admit of con&s;olation, nor if I mi&s;|take not, her ideas of virtue &s;o rigid as to make a fellow &s;hoot him&s;elf that may happen to be enamoured of her; this may &s;uffice to give you an idea of her charac|ter, in ca&s;e you &s;hould chance to be a &s;tranger to it, which I can hardly &s;up|po&s;e; but of her beauty, if you have ne|ver &s;een her, I can give you none, &s;ince 'tis not in the power of language to do it ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now, Charles, confe&s;s I have been a fortunate fellow, for you will not, I hope, be &s;o impertinent as to fancy I can po&s;&s;i|bly fail to render my&s;elf agreeable to her.&mdash;Thus, in&s;tead of lounging about, at a lo&s;s in what manner to kill the time, while compelled to remain here, I expect, and not without rea&s;on, to pa&s;s every hour of it in the highe&s;t felicity; for, as I &s;aid before, my charmer knows too much of life to a&s;&s;ume unnece&s;&s;ary airs of cruelty, or I am greatly deceived in the conjectures I have formed of her; a few I expect, nay, wi&s;h to meet with, as a conque&s;t <HI>too</HI> ea&s;ily gained would render
<PB N="19" REF="18">the bu&s;ine&s;s in&s;ipid, enchanting as &s;he is. Farewell. I am on the wing to pay my devoirs; her &s;eat is but half an hour's ride from hence, and &s;he expects me.</P>

'Twas delightful beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, to &s;ee with what envious eyes they gazed upon me, at the &s;ame time af|fecting to put on airs of indifference and contempt; the truth is, I believe, his con|&s;tant attendance at my villa has already &s;et the &s;illy &s;ouls a talking&mdash;my hu&s;band dead only a few months, and I already on &s;o intimate a footing with a gay young fel|low; fie upon it!&mdash;'tis a fine text for the good &s;ouls, and I'll be &s;worn has been twi&s;ted and turned a thou&s;and different ways by every female in the country&mdash;'tis ever &s;o in the&s;e country places, and really, one mu&s;t pardon it, in con&s;ideration of their being often at a lo&s;s for conver&s;a|tion&mdash;no wonder they make the mo&s;t of a &s;ubject when they happen to find one, and that too, &s;o perfectly &s;uited to their ta&s;te.

<HEAD>LETTER VI. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Colche&s;ter.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY aunt has carried her point in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition, Sophia, and I am actu|ally at this moment writing to you in my old apartment in her man&s;ion; whether I &s;hall find my&s;elf much happier here, than at home, is a point I am, by no means, clear in, for though a good wo|man, and very fond of me, &s;he has her humours as well as &s;ome other folks, but this, at lea&s;t, &s;he has promi&s;ed, that I &s;hall &s;uffer no farther per&s;ecution from the wretch (as &s;he calls him) to whom my dear father has been prevailed upon, for the &s;ake of a quiet life, to promi&s;e my hand&mdash;this a&s;&s;urance, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to my peace, will enable me to bear without a murmur
<PB N="23" REF="22">all her whims, however ridiculous they may &s;ometimes prove; I am, therefore, highly delighted with the change in my &s;ituation, and &s;hould be &s;till more &s;o were I not by it &s;o far removed from you, to who&s;e &s;ociety I have been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed; but to expect to pa&s;s through life without a few di&s;appointments would be expecting more than mortals are enti|tled to; young as I am, I think I may with truth &s;ay, I have already had pretty evident proofs of it.</P>
<P>Never rage equl'd my mother's. Hea|vens! that ever I &s;hould be compelled to give that appellation to a being &s;o totally unworthy of it, &s;o very unlike her amia|ble predece&s;&s;or. Ah! Sophia, what a revo|lution has taken place in our once happy family, &s;ince &s;he a&s;&s;umed the reins of government; but as I was &s;aying, we carried our point in &s;pite of all her elo|quence&mdash;my father is con&s;cious I never could be happy with the creature in who&s;e cau&s;e &s;he &s;o warmly intere&s;ts her|&s;elf; he knows it well, yet &s;uch is the a&s;cendancy &s;he has gained over him, he had not courage to declare his &s;entiments.&mdash;My aunt, who&s;e pride was &s;hocked at the idea of &s;uch an alliance, and who was
<PB N="24" REF="23">glad of an opportunity to mortify a wo|man &s;he mo&s;t cordially de&s;pi&s;es, &s;poke her's, with all imaginable freedom and &s;everity, and, declared, rather than &s;ee her niece married to &s;uch a low bred! in&s;ignificant! illiterate fellow! were he ten times richer than he is, &s;he would with plea&s;ure follow her to her grave. What! &s;hould <HI>her</HI> &s;i&s;ter's daughter, who might boa&s;t of having &s;ome of the noble&s;t blood in the kingdom in her veins, de|ba&s;e her&s;elf by an union with an up&s;tart! a mu&s;hroom! who could not trace his pedigree even to his grandfather! For|bid it pride!&mdash;No, madam, cried &s;he, (animated by the glorious &s;ubject, of all others mo&s;t dear to her) no, I will take care her daughter &s;hall never bring &s;uch a di&s;grace upon <HI>our</HI> family. Though Mr. Herbert has been weak enough to form &s;o mean a connection, let your nephew look out among&s;t his equals for a wife; there he may find numbers who will pay that re&s;pect to his wealth which he is &s;o ambitious to obtain; but a&s;&s;ure him from me, people of <HI>family</HI> know better on whom to be&s;tow it.</P>
<P>Happily for me, Sophia, my poor fa|ther was not pre&s;ent during the dialogue,
<PB N="25" REF="24">of which the above is a part; I &s;hould have &s;at in mi&s;ery if he had; but as he was not, I own I enjoyed it exceedingly. To repeat all that pa&s;&s;ed is impo&s;&s;ible. Suffice it to &s;ay, I am actually here, and depend &s;o much on my aunt's pride and &s;pirit, that I tru&s;t I have nothing farther to apprehend from my ignoble lover. Now let me tell you, my dear Sophia, what changes have happened among&s;t my old friends here &s;ince I left them; &s;o many, indeed, that thought it is but two years, I find very few of my com|panions remaining; &s;ome married, &s;ome dead, and others removed to London; of the latter are the two amiable Fitzher|berts; they have bid adieu to this part of the world, and are both going to be mar|ried. The gentle Maria Danby is no more; this news, though it grieved, did not &s;urprize me; I feared I had taken a la&s;t leave of the dear girl when I was &s;ent for home. The lively Mi&s;s Ma&s;on has at la&s;t given her fair hand to Mr. Mountague, and is as gay, and and as giddy, as if no &s;uch &s;ober event had taken place; &s;he called upon me the moment &s;he heard of my arrival. The&s;e I think, Sophia, are all the names <HI>you</HI> are ac|quainted
<PB N="26" REF="25">with. As Mrs. Mountague was my fir&s;t vi&s;itor, I learned all the above particulars from her, with a thou&s;and diverting anecdotes of many others, for nothing e&s;capes her ob&s;ervation. The following, therefore, you will readily believe <HI>could not</HI> ea&s;ily do &s;o.</P>
<P>But this is not all I have to tell you, Emily, cried &s;he, after having an&s;wered all my que&s;tions; we have got a new neighbour, you mu&s;t know, to &s;upply the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who have for&s;aken us; and &s;uch a flirt&mdash;a lady of quality, child, ju&s;t imported from London, with all the airs and graces of a town bred <HI>belle.</HI> You remember, I pre&s;ume, that old &s;ould of a lord, (who&s;e &s;eat is ju&s;t by, and which you and I u&s;ed &s;o often to wi&s;h in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion)&mdash;perfectly well, my dear; you cannot then have forgot that he, like a wi&s;e man, married a mi&s;s; (I forget her name) about two years and a half ago.&mdash;Well, and pray what next? has he brought her down here to &s;et example to our country dam&s;els?&mdash;Lord child! why he is dead! &s;he is a widow of &s;ix months &s;tanding! and, if I mi&s;take not, has already made choice of a &s;econd hu&s;band. We are all ready to run di&s;|tracted
<PB N="27" REF="26">here you mu&s;t know, for &s;he has, by a &s;ingle glance, of her wicked eyes, robbed us of the mo&s;t elegant fellow that ever figured among&s;t us. <HI>Well</HI> pray, my good friend, what preten&s;ions have you to&mdash;? Pho, pho, interrupt|ing me, I gue&s;s what you are going to &s;ay, my dear&mdash;I am married&mdash;very true, but is that a rea&s;on why I &s;hould not rail at this impertinent monopolizer as well as others?&mdash;She is very hand&s;ome then, I &s;uppo&s;e? O intolerably &s;o! replied my friend. There is po&s;itively no in|during it&mdash;then &s;o conceited, &s;o horidly con&s;cious of her charms. So&mdash;&s;o&mdash;in &s;hort &s;o provokingly in&s;olent, that we are all in a rage, and wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee her fairly eclip&s;ed by &s;ome &s;uperior beauty; and, thank my &s;tars, I no longer de&s;pair of it&mdash;you&mdash;yes even you, my dear Emily, &s;hall effectu|ally do her bu&s;ine&s;s we have all tried it, but to no purpo&s;e, that glorious at|chievement is re&s;erved for you.</P>
<P>Really you are wonderfully kind, Char|lotte, in wi&s;hing to bring me into &s;uch a dilemma; what have I not to dread &s;hould I rob the fair widow of an admirer &s;o highly favoured? No, no, I will have no|thing
<PB N="28" REF="27">to do in the affair, &s;o pray &s;ettle it the be&s;t way you can without me, not to mention my doubt of &s;ucce&s;s after the ac|count you have given me of her attrac|tions.</P>
<P>O! you are wonderfully humble, my dear, at lea&s;t you would endeavour to per&s;uade me &s;o, but I will di&s;appoint you, no compliments &s;hall you get from me, I promi&s;e you, though you have given me &s;o fine an opportunity. I leave that to Lord Sommerville&mdash;A Lord! &s;ay you, nay then I mu&s;t po&s;itively try what can be done; a new face is &s;omething in my fa|vour; aye, Emily, and &s;uch a face as your's too, I'll take any bet, the fir&s;t glance of tho&s;e &s;oft blue eyes &s;hall put the widow's black ones quite out of fa&s;hion. So pray exhibit as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible: I die to &s;ee the effect they will infallibly produce.</P>
<P>But where am I to engage in this ardu|ous undertaking? How am I to get a &s;ight of him? Or rather how is this prodigy of a man to get a &s;ight of me?</P>
<P>Where? why at the a&s;&s;embly to be &s;ure, for there they never fail to make their appearance; but as her Lady&s;hip's recent &s;tate of widowhood does not per|mit
<PB N="29" REF="28">her to dance, they &s;it as &s;pectators, flirting at no &s;mall rate, &s;carce deigning to take the lea&s;t notice of any of the com|pany; and finding this is to be the ca&s;e, the company now, by one con&s;ent, take as little of them: the truth is, we begin to &s;u&s;pect&mdash;O fie, Charlotte!&mdash;Nay, child, wait till you hear others on the &s;ubject, I have been moderate.&mdash;Remem|ber to put on all your airs and graces next Monday; I will <HI>chaperon</HI> you &s;hould your aunt decline going.&mdash;Saying this &s;he took her leave.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Sophia, I mu&s;t bid you al&s;o adieu, having &s;pun out my letter to the extent of my paper. Mrs Mountague has impo&s;ed a pretty kind of ta&s;k upon me, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed; I cannot &s;ay I have quite &s;o great a &s;hare of vanity, notwith&s;tanding her flattery, as to hope for &s;ucce&s;s; however I will try what can be done to revenge the cau&s;e of our ne|glected belles. Believe me ever,</P>

<P>YOU are, no doubt, Sophia, de&s;irous to hear what &s;ucce&s;s I have had in my intended conque&s;t; but I would ad|vi&s;e you to &s;u&s;pend your impatience, as I am &s;orry to inform you I have not yet &s;een this formidable beau.</P>
<P>On mentioning to my aunt, Mrs. Moun|tague's reque&s;t that I &s;hould accompany her to the next a&s;&s;embly, &s;he not only declined going her&s;elf, but begged I would not think of it till &s;he could in|troduce me in a proper manner; after that &s;he &s;hould have no objection to my going with any of my friends.</P>
<P>I own I was a little chagrined at being thus prevented, yet upon the whole I believe &s;he was right. She piques her&s;elf, you know, upon acting in all things with the exacte&s;t propriety.</P>
<P>The above point being &s;ettled, my aunt told me &s;he intended to wait upon Lady Stanley, as &s;he heard &s;he was come to make &s;ome &s;tay in the country.&mdash;The hint Charlotte had given me, made me
<PB N="31" REF="30">he&s;itate in my a&s;&s;ent to her propo&s;al, yet how could I venture to object on &s;o &s;light a foundation? And if I had, I fear the good Lady's prejudice, in favour of tho&s;e happy mortals dignified with a title, would have got the better of all I could &s;ay. She ob&s;erved, however, I did not &s;o rea|dily an&s;wer her as &s;he expected, it &s;eems, and a&s;ked why I pau&s;ed?&mdash;I was then obliged to &s;ay &s;omething, and therefore replied, Mrs. Mountague had been talking to me about her, and &s;eemed to think her rather gay for one who had &s;o lately lo&s;t her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>So you very wi&s;ely concluded Mrs. Mountague a better judge of decorum than I am. Did you, Emily? She forgets, child, that &s;ome grains of allowance are due to per&s;ons of her Lady&s;hip's rank; people of quality have a manner peculiar to them&s;elves, which tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed, as I have been, to a&s;&s;ociate with them, do not comprehend. I &s;hall mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly vi&s;it her; and have too much regard for you, not to take that op|portunity of introducing you, as from &s;uch an example you cannot fail to im|prove your&s;elf in a thou&s;and things, which, though trifling perhaps in them&s;elves, are
<PB N="32" REF="31">yet e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to render a woman perfectly well bred; and which there is no acquiring, except by keeping com|pany with tho&s;e of a certain rank.</P>
<P>This, Sophia, was &s;o like my aunt, that I could hardly keep my gravity; however &s;he luckily did not perceive my looks, and it was &s;ettled that we were to pay our re&s;pects to Lady Stanley the next day. We accordingly did &s;o, but had not the felicity of finding her Lady&s;hip at home, being told &s;he was gone to take an airing.&mdash;I own I was di&s;appointed, as my curio&s;ity was greatly excited; the fol|lowing morning our vi&s;it was returned; but alas! we were then from home al&s;o.</P>
<P>Thus all things remain ju&s;t as they were when I wrote la&s;t, except that we have taken the preliminary &s;teps towards mak|ing an acquaintance with this beauteous widow, who&s;e charms have cau&s;ed &s;uch violent emotions among&s;t us. I ought not indeed to include my&s;elf, &s;ince I cannot &s;ay I am con&s;cious of any at pre&s;ent. How it may be when I have &s;een her and her adorer, I know not; in the interim, I am bu&s;ily employed in making prepara|tions for the a&s;&s;embly, and that, let me tell you, is now an affair of no &s;mall im|portance,
<PB N="33" REF="32">&s;eeing I am deputed to &s;o great an undertaking as the conque&s;t of a Lord.</P>
<P>Were I to let my aunt into the grand &s;ecret, I am per&s;uaded &s;he would, with joy, play the part of my Abigal her&s;elf, on the occa&s;ion, could &s;he thereby hope to facilitate &s;o glorious an enterpri&s;e. How would &s;he exult! how triumph! if &s;he could by my means, or indeed any other, add another twig of quality to her genealogical tree.&mdash;Farewell, dear So|phia; in my next I hope to give a more particular account than I can do at pre|&s;et. In the mean time, believe me ever,</P>

<P>THE important day is over, Sophia, and I have &s;een them.&mdash;But I will, for once, endeavour to be circum&s;tantially minute, as I know it will plea&s;e you better than to &s;kim the &s;urface over as I gene|rally do.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">Well, my dear&mdash;I dre&s;&s;ed, and will freely own, paid rather more attention than u&s;ual to the labours of my toilet: this labour was not lo&s;t, for if I might tru&s;t my gla&s;s I really looked more than bare|ly tolerable.</P>
<P>At the hour appointed, Mrs. Mounta|gue and her hand&s;ome hu&s;band called upon us, for &s;he had agreed to go with us, though my aunt was to be of the party&mdash;The moment &s;he &s;aw me, ah, the poor widow, cried &s;he, alas! thy tri|umph is near an end.&mdash;Why, Emily, for heaven's &s;ake what kind fairy has pre&s;ided at your toilet to day? In my life I never &s;aw you half &s;o lovely, what &s;ay you Mountague, don't you think a certain event is on the eve of taking place? I know not, Charlotte, replied he, what event you particularly allude to, but this I will venture to prophe&s;y, there will be many a wounded heart &s;ent home this evening from the a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;Aye that there will, cried &s;he, both male and fe|male, or I am much mi&s;taken; but let us be going, we are late enough.</P>
<P>Away we drove, the room was already crowded: Mr. Mountague led my aunt to a feat. Sir Charles Neville, whom we
<PB N="35" REF="34">met at the door, took Charlotte's hand, and a friend of his, a Mr. A&s;ton, pre&s;ented me his, and we followed them.&mdash;'Twould be nothing, Sophia, were I not to add, all eyes were fixed upon us as we &s;ailed up the room; this you mu&s;t take for granted, or all my trouble in decorating my&s;elf mu&s;t have been to very little pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>I was impatient, you may believe, to di&s;cover the captivating widow, and no le&s;s to have a peep at her charming cap|tive; in this I was in&s;tantly gratified, as they &s;at exactly oppofite to us; Charlotte was going to point them out to me, when I &s;aid in a half whi&s;per, you may &s;ave your&s;elf that trouble, I cannot be mi&s;ta|ken; in my life I never &s;aw &s;o &s;triking a figure&mdash;as which? As her Lady&s;hip, to be &s;ure, replied I&mdash;you have quite over|looked her impertinent lover then, Emi|ly?&mdash;Not ab&s;olutely; but one at a time if you plea&s;e; we will think of him by and by.</P>
<P>While this pa&s;&s;ed, (for it is a farce to deny it) I ob&s;erved his Lord&s;hip's eyes frequently &s;trayed to where we &s;at; or, mu&s;t I be vain enough to &s;ay? they were fixed upon me; her lady&s;hip too favour|ed
<PB N="36" REF="35">me with &s;ome very &s;crutinizing glan|ces. My aunt now being informed who &s;he was, de&s;ired the ma&s;ter of the cere|monies to introduce us to Lady Stanley; this done, the u&s;ual compliments of being &s;orry we had not the honour of meet|ing her Lady&s;hip at home, &amp;c. &amp;c. pa&s;|&s;ed on all &s;ides, and we again took our &s;eats. I confe&s;s I found her manner and addre&s;s rather cold, and a little haughty. My aunt, however, was very well &s;ati&s;|fied, and declared her quite the woman of quality.</P>
<P>Minuets were now going to begin; we ob&s;erved Lord Sommerville pre&s;s Lady Stanley to walk one with him; &s;he ap|peared &s;urpri&s;ed at his importunity, as if &s;he had &s;aid, why this whim to night, when you know I never do? This was the interpretation my friend and I put upon it; be that as it will, &s;he declined his invitation, but judge of her emotions, for believe me, Sophia, they were abun|dantly vi&s;ible, when, on her Lady&s;hip's refu&s;ing, he in&s;tantly came up to me, and begged I would do him that honour. She appeared &s;hocked to death; and really if &s;he had made a point of aving him wholly to her&s;elf, not without rea&s;on, &s;ince
<PB N="37" REF="36">it &s;eems this was the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which he had pre&s;umed to &s;werve from his allegiance.</P>
<P>I certainly had no pretence to follow her Lady&s;hip's example, as I was not obliged to know that by complying with a re|que&s;t &s;o natural, I planted daggers in her gentle bo&s;om. I gave him my hand then, not, I do a&s;&s;ure you, with an air of tri|umph, but with as much ea&s;e and indif|ference as I &s;hould have given it to any other man in the room.</P>
<P>How we performed will no doubt be recorded in the annals of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;o to their authority I &s;hall leave you for in|formation; I may <HI>now</HI> truly affirm every eye was intently fixed upon us, except when turned to ob&s;erve what effect this wonderful event produced on his morti|fied fair one. I dur&s;t not, for my life, meet tho&s;e of my friend Mrs. Mountague, lea&s;t her <HI>looks</HI> &s;hould have di&s;concerted <HI>mine,</HI> for well did I know they would be archly expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>her</HI> triumph.</P>
<P>By the time we had fini&s;hed our mi|nuet, her Lady&s;hip had pretty well reco|vered from the &s;hock her vanity had re|ceived, and my Lord having led me to my &s;eat, not without a <HI>gentle pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> for
<PB N="38" REF="37">that Sophia would have been a &s;olici&s;m in gallantry of which I pre&s;ume he is in|capable; he found her, on his return, flirting mo&s;t unmercifully with one of his brother red coats; her hoop, flung &s;o gracefully over him, one could barely di&s;|cover the beau's head from under it; and &s;o intent were they on what they were &s;aying, that it was &s;ome time before they ob&s;erved his Lord&s;hip had joined them, or at lea&s;t <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to ob&s;erve it; how, or whether he made his peace, I know not; I rather doubt not, as in &s;pite of her La|dy&s;hip's uncommon flow of &s;pirits, we could perceive &s;ymptoms of their being a little forced; as for him, though he did not leave her &s;ide during the re&s;t of the evening, I am &s;orry to &s;ay I caught his eyes wandering now and then, and by fre|quent taps &s;he gave him with her fan, it appeared &s;he found him &s;omewhat remi&s;s in his attentions.</P>
<P>The room was &s;o much crowded that I was aver&s;e from joining in the country dances, but was at length prevailed upon to go down one with Mr. A&s;ton, who is a very hand&s;ome and very plea&s;ing young man; indeed the ladies in general &s;peak of him in warmer terms, and perhaps he
<PB N="39" REF="38">de&s;erves it; but you know <HI>I</HI> had other things in view.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, I leave you to draw what inference you think proper from the im|portant particulars above recited.&mdash;Have I, or have I not, fulfilled my friend Mrs. Mountague's prophe&s;y? For my part I pretend not to judge. That her Lady|&s;hip was under &s;ome unplea&s;ant apprehen|&s;ions, there is no denying, but whether &s;he had cau&s;e for them is another affair; they &s;erved however to divert Charlotte, and her friend Emily, as well as if ever &s;o well founded; nay, &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon it they were &s;o, and is po&s;itive her reign is drawing to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>You will naturally expect I &s;hould tell you what is my opinion of the hero who has made &s;o capital a figure in my epi&s;tle.&mdash;Why, really, my dear, I have &s;carcely formed any; that he is uncommonly hand|&s;ome is mo&s;t certain;&mdash;that he dances gracefully, pre&s;&s;es one's hand with a ten|derne&s;s, an elegance of manner quite out of the common run, is no le&s;s &s;o&mdash;his eyes, his teeth, his hair, are fine beyond expre&s;&s;ion I mu&s;t acknowledge, in &s;hort, he is, "take him for all in all," the kind of man one would not wi&s;h to be robbed
<PB N="40" REF="39">of. Can I then blame her Lady&s;hip's fears?&mdash;Were he as tenderly attached to me as it &s;eems he is to her, I pre&s;ume&mdash;but we will pre&s;ume no farther.&mdash;She is much too hand&s;ome to be &s;o ea&s;ily rival|led.

<P>My aunt, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for whi&s;t is as great as ever, is to have a party in a few days.

<P>WOULD you believe it, Caroline, I have had a <HI>fracas</HI> with Sommerville&mdash;'twas a fooli&s;h affair, and certainly un|worthy my notice; but one is not always on one's guard again&s;t tho&s;e kind of weak|ne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Will you credit me when I tell you, I was the other night &s;eized with &s;o unaccountable a fit of humility, as to ex|perience &s;omething very like &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y! True as you are alive&mdash;I now blu&s;h while I write it, and wonder at my own folly. Not but he behaved in a mo&s;t ridiculous manner, as you will &s;ay, and I have &s;ince made him confe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">You mu&s;t know there is a Mrs. Gren|ville, who has a hou&s;e in this neighbour|hood; &s;he was ab&s;ent when I fir&s;t came, but returned about ten days &s;ince, and brought with her a niece, the daughter of her &s;i&s;ter, who it &s;eems died a few years ago; but why the deuce &s;hould I take the trouble to give you their &s;tupid hi&s;tory?&mdash;This niece, I'll warrant ye, is looked upon as a beauty, and &s;o was of cour&s;e dre&s;&s;ed out as if for conque&s;t, and introduced at the a&s;&s;embly la&s;t Monday. I &s;hould tell you, however, they had le&s;t their names at my door &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>I happened to be at the rooms when Mi&s;s made her fir&s;t appearance. Fellows are &s;o volatile, you know, Caroline, any thing new, no matter what, attracts their &s;illy notice. Not but the girl is hand&s;ome enough; that is, &s;he is tall and fair, and really at a di&s;tance looks very tolerable; in &s;hort, &s;he no &s;ooner marched up the room, than I heard a general buz of who is &s;he? Who can it be? and &s;uch kind of vulgar country-like exclamations. I now turned my eyes, and found this prodigy &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed her.&mdash;She was accompanied by a Mrs. Mountague, who is al&s;o reckoned a <HI>beauty,</HI> (we have a pro|fu&s;ion
<PB N="43" REF="42">of &s;uch beauties here, you mu&s;t know) and who affects to give her&s;elf as many airs as if &s;he really was one.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;up they came to me, and made &s;ome aukward &s;peeches about not being at home, when I did them the honour to return their vi&s;it, and &s;uch kind of com|mon place chat; to which you may be|lieve I paid very little attention.</P>
<P>I own I rather wondered Sommerville made no remarks when they went back to their &s;eats, as &s;he certainly is not the &s;ort of girl to be <HI>wholly</HI> overlooked; but I &s;oon found he had not been &s;tupid enough for that neither; for no &s;ooner were the minutes going to begin, than he was vi&s;i|bly in the fidgets. I &s;aw plainly &s;he had caught his ob&s;ervation, and that he died to exhibit his fine per&s;on with her.&mdash;I enjoyed his perplexity, though not a lit|tle chagrined, I confe&s;s, to find &s;he had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ly wretch.&mdash;But you will &s;carce believe me when I tell you, the artifice he had recour&s;e to, in order to gratify the whim that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>Nothing would &s;erve him truly, but <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t oblige him by dancing a minuet with him.&mdash;The fir&s;t time, ob&s;erve, he
<PB N="44" REF="43">had reque&s;ted &s;uch a favour, knowing I had made a point of not doing it&mdash;nor had he till then looked upon it as any mortification; but <HI>now</HI> he began to think me much to blame to appear &s;o &s;ingular. Why not do as others did? He longed to have <HI>me</HI> &s;hew them what a minuet ought to be, and a profu&s;ion of &s;uch non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Never, Caroline, had he appeared to me in &s;o truly ridiculous a light. I how|ever refu&s;ed, and that too with a counte|nance which pretty plainly expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments.&mdash;He affected not to ob&s;erve it; but with a forced laugh, cried, How can you, my dear creature, be thus per|ver&s;e? How can you, when you &s;ee the dancing fit &s;o &s;trong upon me, thus re|fu&s;e the honour of this dear hand? But I will be revenged; in the mean time I will go and figure with that new comer, who&s;e looks tell me &s;he would be horribly di&s;appointed, after all the pains &s;he has taken to decorate her&s;elf, if &s;he &s;hould not get an opportunity to di&s;play her finery to advantage.</P>
<P>Away he flew, not daring to wait for my reply; well knowing, I was not &s;o ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed upon, as he affected to believe. What would I not have given
<PB N="45" REF="44">that &s;he had been engaged? How &s;hould I have enjoyed it? But no &s;uch matter&mdash;up &s;he got, and &s;impered not a little at being &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash;How &s;he per|formed you mu&s;t gue&s;s, as I cannot in|form you, for I took care to ca&s;t my eyes another way.</P>
<P>Major Man&s;ell &s;at at my elbow while this pretty &s;cene was going forward. I now turned all my attention on him, and when Sommerville had ended his frolic, he found us &s;o deeply engaged in a lively conver&s;ation, that it was a con&s;i|derable while before I &s;aw he was re|turned to his &s;eat.</P>
<P>As my &s;pirits were by that time reco|vered, mo&s;t unmercifully did I torment him. The Major, quite elate with the notice I had taken of him, joined me, and I believe before we had done, the poor penitent Sommerville wi&s;hed from his &s;oul he had rather been &s;eized with a fit of the gout than that of dancing.&mdash;And he is now &s;o heartily a&s;hamed of his ab&s;urdity, and the figure he cut while we were plaguing him, that I think we have fairly de&s;troyed any impre&s;&s;ion the girl had made upon his mind. You know my talent for &s;atire, Caroline; I
<PB N="46" REF="45">exerted it to the utmo&s;t, and &s;et Mi&s;s off in &s;uch whim&s;ical colours, that I'll en|gage he will never be able to overcome his regret, for giving occa&s;ion to &s;o much raillery.</P>
<P>From that moment he has been more a&s;&s;iduous, more attentive, more devoted to me than ever; and whenever I at|tempt to make her the &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation, which I have &s;everal times done in a ludicrous manner, he begs me to &s;pare him, and confe&s;&s;es the joke is &s;o entirely again&s;t him that he cannot &s;tand it.</P>
<P>Thus ends the &s;tory of our fir&s;t <HI>fracas</HI>; but whether it will be the la&s;t, heaven knows! That he at pre&s;ent adores me, is mo&s;t certain; and that I adore him, is no le&s;s &s;o.&mdash;Judge then, Caroline, what would be my feelings were he to&mdash;Ah! let me not for one moment &s;uppo&s;e him capable of incon&s;tancy.&mdash;Yet have I not &s;ome <HI>little</HI> cau&s;e to fear?&mdash;when even an in&s;ignificant chit, like her, could for an in&s;tant produce &s;uch an effect.</P>
<P>But, Caroline, let her beware how &s;he pre&s;umes to form hopes of his attch|ment.&mdash;I am not a woman formed to &s;et tamely down under &s;uch a mortification.
<PB N="47" REF="46">I know not what I &s;ay&mdash;I hate, I de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf for deigning to be&s;tow a thought upon her.&mdash;But let her, as I &s;aid, beware how &s;he pre&s;umes to lay &s;nares for a heart <HI>I</HI> think worth pre&s;erving.</P>
<P>Let us talk no more of her. She has already engro&s;&s;ed more of my time and thoughts than &s;he has any title to; more I am per&s;uaded than &s;he has of my en|chanting Sommerville's. However, &s;he may flatter her&s;elf to the contrary, and flatter her&s;elf &s;he will, I make no doubt, &s;ince her pert friend, Mrs. Mountague, will not forget to inform her, <HI>&s;he</HI> is the only girl he has hitherto conde&s;cended to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>This will of cour&s;e &s;et her &s;illy heart in a flutter; and&mdash;But no more of the hateful &s;ubject.&mdash;I dete&s;t my&s;elf for troubling my head &s;o much about it. All I meant when I took up my pen, was to divert you with the ridiculous &s;tory, and to laugh with you at it; and yet it has actually put me out of temper&mdash;nor can any thing in life be more &s;tupid?&mdash;We are to vi&s;it too, that's the be&s;t of it; we &s;hall, no doubt, be <HI>prodigiou&s;ly intimate.</HI></P>
<P>Adieu, dear Caroline, I do not intend being at their next trumpery a&s;&s;embly.
<PB N="48" REF="47">I am &s;ick of them: one cannot for ever laugh at the &s;ame thing, however <HI>laugh|able.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. <HI>Lord Sommerville to Charles Dalton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Colche&s;ter.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CHARLES, I have got into a mo&s;t confounded &s;crape, and how to extricate my&s;elf in the manner <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h, the Lord above knows. I am cur&s;edly entangled with this &s;educing, this bewitching wi|dow. I &s;till do ju&s;tice to her charms, and confe&s;s they are &s;uperior to mo&s;t I have &s;een; yet I never told you they were &s;uch as to make a &s;erious or la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on me: this you cannot deny.&mdash;She is not the kind of woman with whom <HI>one's heart</HI> has any thing to do.</P>
<P>All I meant by my connection with her, was to amu&s;e the time likely to hang heavy on my hands while confined to
<PB N="49" REF="48">country quarters. This purpo&s;e &s;he fully an&s;wered; but for any thing farther, I never had an idea of it.&mdash;True, one could not be quite &s;o explicit with <HI>her</HI> on the &s;ubject; and &s;he has unluckily taken a thou&s;and ridiculous things for granted, which never once entered into my head. The con&s;equence is, I do not know for my &s;oul how to get hand&s;omely quit of her.</P>
<P>But why in &s;uch a hurry? You'll pro|bably a&s;k, &s;ince our amour is of &s;o &s;hort a date?&mdash;That is the very thing, Charles, I am to explain to you.</P>
<P>Though my heart has been merely pa&s;&s;ive in <HI>this</HI> affair, it is now in a very different &s;tate; nay, if I may judge by its pre&s;ent feelings, I am apt to believe it has never known any thing of a real pa&s;|&s;ion; for ah! Charles, never till now had it &s;een the lovely, the engaging, the blooming Emily Herbert. All language mu&s;t fall far &s;hort of her perfection; it is impo&s;&s;ible to give you an idea of her&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay that I love, love even to madne&s;s, and nothing but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart and per&s;on of her I adore, can re&s;tore me to my &s;ober &s;en&s;es; mar|ry her I cannot, for am I not as <HI>bad</HI> as
<PB N="50" REF="49">married? already fettered by that cur&s;ed engagement to my cou&s;in&mdash;would to the Lord &s;he were buried fifty fathom deep.</P>
<P>My wife father may thank him&s;elf for all the irregularities I have been and may chance to be guilty of; had he left me at liberty to follow my own inclinations, I am po&s;itive I &s;hould have led a better life than I have done; not that I have been much wor&s;e than my neighbours after all; though they are plea&s;ed to take &s;ome liberties with my character; let them be placed in my confounded &s;ituation, and &s;ee if they will behave bet|ter. Marry her I certainly never will, but unle&s;s &s;he is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to re|lea&s;e me from my engagement, I can marry no other.</P>
<P>Is this, Charles, &s;o great a trouble a man cannot get over, do you think? Or equal to lo&s;ing the better half of my e&s;tate?&mdash;I think not. Now, &s;hould I be refractory, and take any other woman to be my wedded wife, in defiance of the family compact, that precious better half goes to her Lady&s;hip.&mdash;Cur&s;e me if it &s;hall! No, no! my con&s;olation is, I am not <HI>compelled</HI> to be <HI>hers</HI>&mdash;that is no incon&s;ider|able one; and &s;ince I cannot be another's,
<PB N="51" REF="50">Charles, let the dear creatures look to them&s;elves. It would be devili&s;h hard if I may not be permitted to amu&s;e my|&s;elf among&s;t them the be&s;t way I can, &s;ince my perver&s;e &s;tars forbids my figur|ing in the &s;ober character of a hu&s;band. That is to &s;ay, unle&s;s they have the li|berty to chu&s;e me a wife.</P>
<P>What I have now &s;aid, I hope will fully ju&s;tify any &s;teps I may find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take in the pro&s;ecution of the affair on which my whole happine&s;s at this moment depends, in your opinion I mean; in my own, it certainly will&mdash;but, I confe&s;s, I have &s;o much regard for you, though you are rather a queer fellow too in &s;ome re&s;pects, that I &s;hould not like to incur your cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to the Lord, Charles, you would go and pay your addre&s;&s;es to my rib elect; perhaps you may like her well enough, though I do not; for &s;he is thought, by the unprejudiced, both hand|&s;ome and agreeable. I will lay my life &s;he will not refu&s;e <HI>you,</HI> you are as clever a fellow, pretty nearly, as my&s;elf; nay, &s;he may chance to give you the prefer|ence, for women are whim&s;ical kind of animals. That &s;he does not care a &s;traw
<PB N="52" REF="51">for me, &s;he has the impertinence to ac|knowledge; but loves mi&s;chief &s;o much better than any thing el&s;e in life, that &s;he vows &s;he will either have me, or my e&s;tate, out of pure &s;pite and revenge for my indifference.</P>
<P>There's a &s;pirit for you&mdash;Don't you think I &s;hould be wonderous happy with &s;uch a helpmate? She, like a vixen as &s;he is, enjoys my hampered &s;ituation be|yond expre&s;&s;ion, and makes it the &s;ubject of her mirth, not only to me, when we happen to meet, but to every body el&s;e. Would to heaven &s;he was as madly in love with me as I am with my adored Emily, that I might have it in my power to break her heart by my cruelty.</P>
<P>Yet this is the girl my father thought fit to entail upon me for a wife, becau&s;e, truly, he fancied him&s;elf under obligati|ons to her father, who cho&s;e to a&s;k <HI>only</HI> that as a return for the favours he had conferred. Had I been in England when he died, I might perhaps have contrived to have got the article relating to the cur&s;ed agreement &s;truck out of his will, but as ill-luck would have it, before I ar|rived all was over, and I found my&s;elf
<PB N="53" REF="52">fettered as &s;ecurely as law could bind me.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, Charles, what's to be done?&mdash;My Emily's &s;ituation in life is &s;uch as precludes all hope of ob|taining her on tho&s;e terms, as I only am at liberty to offer. I &s;aw her for the fir&s;t time, at the a&s;&s;embly, about ten days &s;ince. I was &s;itting by Lady Stanley, who had, till then, wholly engro&s;&s;ed me, being by far the fine&s;t woman in the place; and having, as I told you before, in very <HI>plain</HI> terms expre&s;&s;ed her partia|lity for me, I could not do le&s;s than make a <HI>&s;uitable</HI> return.</P>
<P>We were of cour&s;e on the mo&s;t amicable footing imaginable&mdash;But ah! Charles, who can expre&s;s either my emotions or embarra&s;&s;ment on &s;eeing the mo&s;t angeic creature my eyes ever be|held walk up the room? Embarra&s;&s;ment I &s;ay, becau&s;e I dur&s;t not for my &s;oul let her Lady&s;hip &s;ee the impre&s;&s;ion her beauty had made upon me&mdash;I was com|pelled to di&s;&s;emble, yet made &s;o bung|ling a piece of work of it, that it was to no purpo&s;e. She &s;aw it, and though vi&s;i|bly enraged that I &s;hould pre&s;ume to ca&s;t an eye on any other than her&s;elf, affected
<PB N="54" REF="53">to rally me with an air of indifference, and to turn tho&s;e perfections, &s;he &s;ecretly envied, into ridicule; we both failed in our purpo&s;e however; it was no &s;ubject for a joke.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed all my efforts to command my|&s;elf for <HI>that</HI> evening at lea&s;t, but found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible; in &s;pite of the mortification I well knew my mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t &s;uffer; the mu&s;ic no &s;ooner began for minuets than up I &s;tarted, Charles; the idea of her dear hand being given to another was not to be indured; I made an offer of mine to my widow, begging &s;he would for once indulge me; &s;he &s;aw through me, and gave me <HI>&s;uch a look</HI>&mdash;but no hand, you may believe.</P>
<P>Away I flew to my charmer; and &s;he with an ea&s;e, a grace, there is no de|&s;cribing, granted my &s;uit. Heavens! what elegance, what mode&s;t dignity did &s;he di&s;play in every motion. Had &s;he not thought fit to put an end to it, I &s;hould have danced on for the whole evening; &s;he &s;miled at my vi&s;ible inattention to the bu&s;ine&s;s, but whether &s;he imputed it to the right cau&s;e I know not; though I flatter my&s;elf &s;he could not be at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">Figure to your&s;elf, Charles, what pa&s;&s;ed on my return to my angry fair one. Words would never give you an idea of the &s;cene; I certainly looked as truly ridiculous as even &s;he could wi&s;h; indeed I felt it. She, however, was flirting at no &s;mall rate with our major, quite <HI>un|concerned as it were,</HI> affected not to ob&s;erve me for &s;ome time, and when &s;he did ca&s;t an eye upon me, was &s;o gracious, &s;o lively, &s;o witty&mdash;In &s;hort, Charles, it was an excellent farce.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince patched up a kind of peace, but I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect it will not be very la&s;ting, though &s;he endeavours to make me believe &s;he has forgot the whole affair; this I know is far from being the ca&s;e, and I &s;hall therefore be upon my guard; for, I am fully per&s;uaded, &s;he is not of a temper to put up, without re|&s;entment, what &s;he will doubtle&s;s deem an unpardonable in&s;ult offered to her charms. She has a devil of a &s;pirit, and I am well a&s;&s;ured would &s;tick at nothing to be revenged. It is this belief makes me &s;ay I am got into a confounded &s;crape.</P>
<P>Had the lovely, the enchanting Emily been &s;ome weeks longer before &s;he made her appearance, it is probable &s;he might
<PB N="56" REF="55">have found Lady Stanley in a more fa|vourable di&s;po&s;ition, her partiality might, by that time have been le&s;&s;ened, for I have not the vanity to flatter my&s;elf <HI>even my attractions,</HI> great as they are, and violent as the effect is they have produced on her, would have power to fix a woman of her principies for any con&s;iderable period.</P>
<P>But to rob her of her captive in the very height of her pa&s;&s;ion, to rival her in my love at the moment &s;he believed me blind to the perfections of every other woman&mdash;is this to be borne, Charles, by a female of her &s;pirit? I &s;ear not. I own I have my &s;u&s;picions, as I think &s;he over acts her part; I doubt the &s;incerity of tho&s;e &s;miles &s;he favours me with, and &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect they are intended to conceal &s;ome hidden purpo&s;e; it is unnatural to be|lieve &s;he could &s;o ea&s;ily pardon the emo|tions, to which &s;he was a witne&s;s, the fir&s;t &s;ight of her rival gave birth to; it is true I &s;aid all that man could &s;ay to appeafe the &s;torm; and, as I was telling you, &s;he endeavours to per&s;uade me I have &s;ucceeded, thogh I doubt the fact.</P>
<P>But this is not the wor&s;t.&mdash;How &s;hall I pre&s;ume to &s;ue for the affections of the
<PB N="57" REF="56">lovely Emily, at the time when every &s;oul in the neighbourhood are talking mo&s;t impertinently of my pa&s;&s;ion for the widow?&mdash;You will ea&s;ily gue&s;s our flir|tation has afforded ample &s;cope for tea-table chat, and that &s;he has already been let into the whole &s;ecret.</P>
<P>My con&s;tancy, to be &s;ure, will appear to no great advantage; yet mu&s;t it not be more flattering to her, to find her charms have had the power to diffolve &s;uch an attachment, than if &s;he had mere|ly captivated an unengaged heart?&mdash;Cer|tainly. And, depend upon it, this re|flection will have its due weight. Thus I rea&s;on upon it, Charles, and I hope you will think it <HI>rea&s;onable.</HI>&mdash;Pardon the pun, &s;hould it &s;trike you as one.</P>
<P>Well, don't you think I am in a hope|ful way? Entangled with one woman, for whom I never in reality cared &s;ix|pence, and dying for another, who pro|bably cares as little for me. But I will not think my ca&s;e &s;o de&s;perate, becau&s;e I &s;hould be tempted to &s;hoot my&s;elf through the head, did I believe it.</P>
<P>After this, I need hardly tell you, I mean to try my &s;ate with the dear girl, and &s;hall &s;oon know whether I am to
<PB N="58" REF="57">load my pi&s;tols or not; for as to living without her, it is an impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>This is all I can tell you at pre&s;ent, except that my torment (for as &s;uch I now look upon her) vi&s;its the idol of my &s;oul.&mdash;Her aunt, with whom &s;he lives at pre&s;ent, has &s;o great a partiality for every thing dignified with a title, that in &s;pite of a few &s;candalous anecdotes which have flown about concerning her Lady&s;hip, &s;he has called upon her on her return to the country.</P>
<P>The &s;ame favourable circum&s;tance may perhaps gain me admi&s;&s;ion: hitherto I have only had the felicity of meeting my adorable once or twice as &s;he was airing in the carriage with her old duenna. My bow was graciou&s;ly returned, accompa|nied by a mo&s;t bewitching &s;mile.&mdash;Adieu.&mdash;</P>

She has had &s;everal parties, and his Lord&s;hip is never left out of the li&s;t of her invited friends&mdash;he is &s;o well bred, &s;o agreeable, &s;o perfectly the <HI>man of quality.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e are her remarks, not mine, pray ob&s;erve that. Though I con|fe&s;s I mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice of them, for he really has the art of plea&s;ing in a very eminent degree.</P>
<P>And does he practice this dangerous talent on you, Emily? My Sophia would
<PB N="60" REF="59">I pre&s;ume.&mdash;Why not? It would be pay|ing me a poor compliment were be to make me an exception.&mdash;But no more trifling, I love you too well to teaze you.</P>
<P>Know then that I have &s;ome little rea|&s;on to believe, I have made a deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his mind than is perfectly agreeable to his <HI>friend,</HI> the charming wi|dow, for &s;he <HI>now</HI> affects to talk of him merely as a <HI>friend,</HI> a young man for whom <HI>&s;he really has a particular e&s;teem</HI>; one whom &s;he wi&s;hes well, as he appears to be de|&s;erving, and to whom, as a &s;tranger in the country, and a man of fa&s;hion, &s;he has &s;hewn &s;ome little attntion.&mdash;You &s;tare!&mdash;That, my dear, is merely becau&s;e you are unacquainted with the <HI>ton,</HI> or the manners and caprices of a belle from the metropolis. I doubt not you was &s;imple enough to expect I had to tell you, her Lady&s;hip, like our coantry bred dam&s;els, was &s;ighing and pining her&s;elf to death, and was actually driven to de&s;pair by the perfidy of her fickle admirer.</P>
<P>No &s;uch thing, believe me. 'Tis not the fa&s;hion, my dear, in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> "In love to pine and langui&s;h,"&mdash;is quite out of the que&s;tion there. Such a con|duct
<PB N="61" REF="60">would imply a degree of con&s;tancy, at which a fine London Lady would blu&s;h. What their real feelings may be, is ano|ther affair; but to appear as if they felt them&s;elves for&s;aken, what woman of &s;pi|rit would &s;ubmit to? Not Lady Stanley; at lea&s;t I can an&s;wer for her. And cer|tainly it is the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e, though every one has not a &s;ufficient &s;hare of philo&s;o|phy to put it in practice.</P>
<P>My aunt is now fully convinced there never was any other than a friendly re|gard between them. Perhaps &s;he is the more inclined to be of this opinion, be|cau&s;e &s;he has, I verily believe, from the particular attention my Lord begins to honour her niece with, formed &s;ome very ridiculous (and mo&s;t likely &s;allacious) hopes. Ridiculous I call them, and I think ju&s;tly; for can any thing be more again&s;t them than this recent proof of his incon&s;tancy.&mdash;What reliance can we, or ought we to place on a man of &s;uch a changeable di&s;po&s;ition? Any new face, I pre&s;ume, if tolerable, would produce the &s;ame effect. He vows the contrary; for he has already begun vowing, and all that, Sophia; but whatever the neglected widow may think proper to confe&s;s, &s;he
<PB N="62" REF="61">too could tell the &s;ame &s;tory, or I am much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>After all, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf her pa&s;&s;ion for him has been very deeply root|ed; &s;ince if it had, I think, artful as &s;he is, &s;he could not all at once have a&s;&s;umed &s;uch an air of in 'ifference; 'tis more probable &s;he is, as well as him&s;elf, ble&s;&s;ed with a da&s;h of incon&s;tancy in her nature, or &s;he could not &s;o calmly re&s;ign him.</P>
<P>Do not from this, Sophia, infer, I think him &s;o valuable a prize; I mu&s;t know him better before I determine that point: at pre&s;ent appearances are rather again&s;t him, according to my ideas.&mdash;And were it otherwi&s;e, and he &s;hould really mean to gratify my aunt's ambition, what am I to do with my Nabob?&mdash;Can &s;he &s;up|po&s;e my &s;tep-dame will &s;o ea&s;ily give up <HI>her point,</HI> and con&s;ent to her hopeful ne|phew's being rejected for any Lord in the creation?</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia, if I can contrive to delay that hated match, 'tis all I dare hope for.&mdash;Yet, mere delay will not do neither. Heaven forbid! I &s;hould ever be compel|led to be his; but I mean, if they will permit me to live &s;ingle, it is all the fa|vour I <HI>can</HI> expect; and, compared to giv|ing
<PB N="63" REF="62">him my hand, would be perfect hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>I tremble every day, left I &s;hould get letters to order me home; my only tru&s;t is, that my aunt is, if po&s;&s;ible, as aver&s;e from calling him nephew, as I am to call him&mdash;Ah! I &s;hudder even to write it&mdash;And that &s;he will not ea&s;ily be prevailed upon to put me again in his way: now indeed &s;he will be more aver&s;e than ever, having, as I &s;aid, formed hopes of &s;o &s;u|perior a nature, all his boa&s;ted wealth will never, in her opinion, compen&s;ate for the meanne&s;s of his origin&mdash;this is with her an un&s;urmountable objection; but I, So|phia, find a thou&s;and others. He is a creature of no education, no breeding, no delicacy; I &s;hould blu&s;h every time he opened his lips; there is a vulgarity about him that ab&s;olutely &s;hocks me. Yet he has the vanity to fancy him&s;elf a man of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, and has more <HI>hau|teur</HI> than if he really as &s;o; but this is natural, &s;ince pride and meanne&s;s are in&s;eparable companions.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t fervently do I pray he may meet in London (where he is at pre&s;ent) &s;ome &s;air creature more to his ta&s;te; there he may find numbers who will gladly accept
<PB N="64" REF="63">him with all his imperfections. 'Tis only &s;uch &s;illy &s;ouls as you and, Sophia, who having unfortunately more &s;entiment than ambition, could re&s;i&s;t &s;o &s;plendid a temp|tation. That this may be the fir&s;t news I hear, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of</P>

<P>HELP me, Caroline, to execrate the mo&s;t ungrateful, the mo&s;t perfidious of men; and above all, help me to take am|ple vengeance on the dete&s;ted object who has robbed me of his heart.</P>
<P>Yes, Caroline, I have lo&s;t it&mdash;in vain would he add to his guilt by endeavour|ing to deceive me. I de&s;pi&s;e him for daring to &s;ancy he can impo&s;e upon me by his feigned tenderne&s;s. Long have I been &s;en&s;ible of the mortifying truth. A love like mine was too clear &s;ighted
<PB N="65" REF="64">not to perceive it, in &s;pite of all his ef|forts to conceal what he had not courage openly to avow.&mdash;Ah! no wonder he &s;hould blu&s;h at &s;o prepo&s;terous an attach|ment.&mdash;Heavens! that I &s;hould live to find a rival in a creature &s;o in&s;ignifi|cant; a mere ignorant girl, who has no one thing to recommend her, but youth and novelty.</P>
<P>Oh! how I could cur&s;e the hour in which I was fool enough to fix my affec|tions on a wretch &s;o unworthy that ten|derne&s;s my weak heart has lavi&s;hed on him.</P>
<P>Why are you not here, that I might, without the trouble of writing, vent a part of the rage which at this moment con|&s;umes me?</P>
<P>I am di&s;tracted! driven to madne&s;s, nor &s;hall I ever know one moment's peace of mind till I have effectually de&s;troyed theirs.</P>
<P>Let her not pre&s;ume to flatter her&s;elf her triumph &s;hall be of long duration; &s;he &s;hall be humbled, Caroline, humbled to the du&s;t, if my good genius does not for&s;ake me in the glorious attempt.</P>
<P>Can you figure to your&s;elf what were my feelings, on finding my &s;u&s;picions of
<PB N="66" REF="65">his infidelity confirmed beyond all po&s;&s;i|ble doubt? Yet, what a que&s;tion?&mdash;No, you mu&s;t fir&s;t have loved like me, and like me have been&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not, cannot proceed&mdash;my pride forbids it.&mdash;Let me from this hour bani&s;h <HI>that</HI> horrid idea from my memory, and for the future devote my whole atten|tion to dear revenge.</P>
<P>Little does he know the woman he has dared to &s;light; but he &s;hall, by dear bought experience, learn &s;he is not formed of &s;uch &s;oft materials, as either to forget or forgive an injury, though &s;he has art enough to concenl her re&s;entment till a proper opportunity pre&s;ents it&s;elf, in which &s;he can di&s;play it to &s;ome pur|po&s;e&mdash;and of that &s;he does not de&s;pair. But let me endeavour to be calm, that I may give you &s;ome idea of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>What I have now &s;aid will not much &s;urpri&s;e von after the <HI>hints</HI> you will find dropped in &s;everal of my letters. I confe&s;s I found it no very plea&s;ant bu&s;i|ne&s;s to be more explicit; however I have at lerght conquered that &s;cruple, and have freely told you Sommerville has proved him&s;elf a villain&mdash;that is to &s;ay a
<PB N="67" REF="66">man, for are they not all deceivers, born for our de&s;truction?&mdash;'Tis the character given of them by one of their own &s;ex, yet in &s;pite of this we continue to believe, and are of cour&s;e undone.</P>
<P>Finding all hopes of regaining his per|fidious heart at an end, I at once deter|mined to deceive him in my turn. I could not &s;toop to reproaches;  &s;corned to gratify <HI>his vanity</HI> &s;o far as to give him &s;o clear a proof that he had it in his power to mortify <HI>mine.</HI> I took a different me|thod, and flatter my&s;elf he is the dupe of my artifice.</P>
<P>Spare your&s;elf the trouble, my dear Sommerville, &s;aid I one day, (while he was endeavouring to per&s;uade me of what he well knew was a fal&s;ity;) why this re|&s;erve with your friends? I am not to learn that we cannot command our affec|tions, I know it by experience; mine has betrayed me into a weakne&s;s which tho&s;e de&s;titute of my &s;en&s;ibility would un|doubtedly condemn; perhaps I ought to condemn my&s;elf&mdash;that you <HI>did love</HI> me, I have had many proo&s;s; but that you now love another, is no le&s;s clear to me.</P>
<P>Ah! my charming Lady Stanley, cried he, attempting to take my hand.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">Do not interrupt what I am &s;aying, nor fancy an apology either nece&s;&s;ary or po&s;|&s;ible to excu&s;e you for what mo&s;t women would &s;tyle your perfidious conduct&mdash;I &s;corn to reproach you; nay, I am &s;en&s;i|ble the crime is as involuntary as were your profe&s;&s;ions to me of an everla&s;ting attachment; you then believed what you &s;were; I was happy while that attach|ment continued: but do not fancy me &s;o unrea&s;onable a creature as to blame you for what I know it is not in your power to help.</P>
<P>Incon&s;i&s;tency is rooted in our nature, it is vain to deny it. You have only got the &s;tart of me, my good friend; for, do not flatter your&s;elf, my pa&s;&s;ion for you could have retained its fir&s;t fervour much longer; I might, indeed, have followed your example, and have attempted to deceive you. I will al&s;o add, I think I &s;hould have been more &s;ucce&s;sful too; for you men are &s;ad bunglers in the&s;e matters; but my nature is open, frank, and hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Since love is then at an end, let us at lea&s;t continue friends; I will not &s;wear I &s;hall not look out for another Adonis to &s;upply your place; a woman mu&s;t have
<PB N="69" REF="68">&s;omebody to &s;ay civil things to her; per|haps I may not ea&s;ily find one who is &s;o well qualified for the employment as your&s;elf; perhaps too, I wi&s;h you had not quite &s;o &s;oon re&s;igned it: but, as I &s;aid before, I am, for a woman, a tole|rably rea&s;onable being.</P>
<P>Now, Sommerville, (giving him my hand) we are friends: he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips. Ah! how I adore this noble can|dour, the&s;e truly generous &s;entiments; I ever knew my lovely Arabella was above the little foibles of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>No compliments, I be&s;eech you; you forget your conduct flatly contradicts the flaming &s;peech you have ju&s;t made. Fare|well; I am going to dre&s;s; when you can &s;pare an hour from more agreeable avo|cations, let me &s;ee you. Saying this I bid him good morning; and <HI>he,</HI> not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than delighted, I pre&s;ume, at my heroi&s;m, left me.</P>
<P>Now, Caroline, let me know what you think of my fortitude; it co&s;t me &s;ome pangs I own, but tru&s;t I &s;hall be amply recompen&s;ed before I have done with them.</P>
<P>To facilitate my purpo&s;e, I judged it proper to cultivate &s;ome degree of inti|macy
<PB N="70" REF="69">with my rival, and her old aunt. The latter thinks her&s;elf a prodigy of wi&s;dom, but is, in fact, a fool, whom I mo&s;t cordially de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>As much do I de&s;pi&s;e the di&s;tinction &s;he treats me with, for well do I know it is my title alone to which I am indebted for it: to her inferiors, or &s;uch as <HI>&s;he</HI> is plea&s;ed to look upon in that light, &s;he be|haves with all the in&s;olence and pride you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine; &s;he ab&s;olutely &s;ick|ens me with her ful&s;ome adulation. I am &s;o <HI>my Lady'd and Lady&s;hip'd</HI> whenever we meet, that I can hardly re&s;train my ri&s;ible faculties. I &s;ee plainly &s;he <HI>bridles</HI> not a little at the conque&s;t her baby-faced niece has made, and has already &s;et her down in her &s;tupid imagination a <HI>lady&s;ip</HI> al&s;o&mdash;but I'll take care to di&s;appoint her &s;illy hopes, &s;uppo&s;ing the fellow has in reality any &s;uch views, which I am, how|ever, very far from believing.</P>
<P>Heavens! were I convinced he had ever formed &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o ab&s;urd an idea, I &s;wear to you I would not &s;eruple to treat them both with a do&s;e of poi&s;on; I freely confe&s;s <HI>that</HI> would be a triumph I could not stand&mdash;but enough of the dete&s;ted &s;ub|ject

<P>WILL it greatly &s;upri&s;e you, my dear Sophia, to hear that the elegant Sommerville has actually declared him|&s;elf my lover?&mdash;Not at all, you reply, &s;ince you fore&s;aw what would happen from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>You have certainly proved your&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of no &s;mall &s;hare of di&s;cernment, for it is really and truly the ca&s;e&mdash;that is to &s;ay, he &s;wears it&mdash;how truly, I dare not yet pronounce. But if this &s;hould not excite your a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;urely, what I am going to add, mu&s;t.</P>
<P>Lady Stanley and I are now on the mo&s;t &s;ociable footing imaginable; &s;he calls up|on me frequently, and talks of his Lord|&s;hip with &s;o much ea&s;e and indifference,
<PB N="72" REF="71">that I am almo&s;t tempted to believe the report of her intimacy with him has ab|&s;olutely been groundle&s;s. Either this is the ca&s;e, or &s;he is the mo&s;t complete di&s;|&s;embler I ever met with. She told me he had made her the confidant of his pa&s;|&s;ion for me; &s;poke of him in the highe&s;t terms, and really pleaded his cau&s;e with nearly as much warmth as he does him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>What are we to think of all this, So|phia? For my part I am wholly at a lo&s;s&mdash;If &s;he does, nay if &s;he ever did love him, it is mo&s;t unnatural, mo&s;t unaccoun|table&mdash;yet what intere&s;t can &s;he have in playing the hypocrite to <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s I doubt exceedingly tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions of regard and friend&s;hip &s;he con|tinually expre&s;&s;es, not only for him, but my&s;elf al&s;o. They are too violent to be &s;incere on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance as ours. I believe, were the truth known, &s;he &s;ets me down as a very cold in&s;ipid kind of a girl, for I cannot prevail on my|&s;elf to make &s;uitable returns to all the civil things &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay to me. I have not lived long enough in the <HI>beau monde</HI> to be mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a flattering talent.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">My aunt and her Lady&s;hip are exceed|ingly gracious, and no wonder, for &s;he affects to pay the highe&s;t deference to all &s;he &s;ays, and in my humble opinion, that has been a great deal more than was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to one who is in fact a &s;tranger. But who can feel any degree of re&s;erve, or conceal any thing a <HI>per&s;on of quality</HI> will do one the honour to li&s;ten to?</P>
<P>This obliging conde&s;cen&s;ion has induc|ed my loquacious aunt to acquaint her with all our family affairs; and, among&s;t others, my father's ridiculous plan (as &s;he calls it) of giving my hand to Mor|ton, who&s;e accompli&s;hments &s;he has paint|ed in no very flattering colours, nor has &s;he forgot to a&s;&s;ure her, it is a match which never &s;hall take place while it is in her power to prevent it. Her &s;i&s;ter's daughter &s;hall never be thrown away on &s;uch an up&s;tart; a fellow of ye&s;terday, who&s;e fortune is the only circum&s;tance that could po&s;&s;ibly gain him admi&s;&s;ion to the company of gentlemen.</P>
<P>Lady Stanley applauds her &s;pirit, the delicacy of her &s;entiments, and the no|ble re&s;olution &s;he has formed to oppo&s;e &s;o prepo&s;terous an alliance, and then flat|ters her vanity by mentioning Lord Som|merville's vi&s;ble attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="73">I generally &s;it &s;ilent on the&s;e occa&s;ions, horribly vexed at my aunt's well-meant &s;implicity, and doubting the truth of every word her Lady&s;hip utters.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible, Sophia, to conceive a regard for a per&s;on of who&s;e veracity you are by no means certain. A fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion is not ea&s;ily conquered, and the fir&s;t I received of this (I &s;u&s;pect artful) dowager, was not the mo&s;t favourable.</P>
<P>A title in the opinion of my good aunt, is like charity, it covers a multitude of faults. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay, I have not &s;o high a veneration for it, &s;o his Lord|&s;hip need not be jealous of his, &s;ince it will have very little influence in deciding the an&s;wer I am to give to his &s;uit.</P>
<P>I begin to fear you too, Sophia, will think me, as well as Lady Stanley, rather tinctured with in&s;ipidity, by the cool un|impa&s;&s;ioned manner in which I write of a lover, and of &s;uch a lover too as the ac|compli&s;hed Sommerville.&mdash;But you are mi&s;taken, my dear, if you fancy I am quite in&s;en&s;ible to his merit and attrac|tion.&mdash;Ah! Sophia, would it not be bet|ter, could I with truth a&s;&s;ure you, they had made no impre&s;&s;ion on me? Mo&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="74">certainly it would; for what can I ex|pect but trouble and di&s;tre&s;s from indulg|ing hopes which never may be realized?</P>
<P>My aunt, on the contrary, &s;ees no ob|&s;tacles; in&s;i&s;ts upon it I &s;hall accept his hand without con&s;ulting even my father; is po&s;itive he will be highly delighted to find <HI>&s;he</HI> has been able to procure for me &s;o noble an alliance. It is all to be her doings you &s;ee, Sophia.</P>
<P>That he is amiable, and that my heart is but too &s;en&s;ible of it, I will not pretend to deny. Yet &s;till I dare not look for|ward; I &s;ee nothing, as I was &s;aying, but trouble and di&s;appointment. Think of the rage and indignation I &s;hould bring upon my poor father's head, however he might &s;ecretly approve my conduct. Can I, without pain, think of &s;ubjecting him to the &s;torm he mu&s;t con&s;equently ex|pect from a wife, of who&s;e implacable di&s;po&s;ition he has had &s;o many proofs? I am &s;hocked at the idea&mdash;yet &s;till more <HI>&s;hocked</HI> at the thoughts of appea&s;ing the &s;torm, by the &s;acrifice of my peace of mind, and of every po&s;&s;ibility of happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>'Till I &s;aw, that is, till I knew Lord Sommerville, the utmo&s;t of my hopes
<PB N="76" REF="75">was, permi&s;&s;ion to live &s;ingle, rather than give my hand to the man I dete&s;t. But now, Sophia, I am afraid that permi&s;&s;ion alone would not content me. Yet even that is not yet granted.</P>
<P>I every day expect to be obliged to re|turn home, in &s;pite of all my aunt's ef|forts to detain me: the hated time draws near, when my tormentor is again to be in our neighbourhood, which will I doubt prove the la&s;t of my liberty, as they will certainly recall me; then farewell hope! Farewell happine&s;s! And farewell my too amiable Sommerville.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject has quite di&s;concerted me; Sophia, I mu&s;t bid you adieu; dearly, I I fear, &s;hall I pay for the few weeks hap|pine&s;s I have enjoyed &s;ince I came here. Alas, alas! How little do we know what is likely to promote our felicity; to avoid one kind of mi&s;ery, have I not fooli&s;h|ly plunged my&s;elf into another; which may, perhaps, prove as fatal to my peace?&mdash;Adieu, once more.</P>

<P>I Plead guilty, Charles, &s;o pray let me have your pardon; yet is it &s;o very won|derful I &s;hould have been a little negli|gent, when you con&s;ider the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s I am engaged in? To get fairly quit of one mi&s;tre&s;s, and to gain the heart of another; no tri&s;ting affair you mu&s;t confe&s;s, and what none but a fellow of my &s;pirit, I will venture any bet, could have &s;o happily accompli&s;hed in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>I told you, in my la&s;t, I believe, of being introduced to Mrs. Grenville, and of cour&s;e to her adorable niece, the love|ly Emily: this I feared was not the mo&s;t difficult part of the undertaking; how to appea&s;e the apprehended wrath of my fair dowager, appeared to me infinitely more &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77">But judge, if you can, of my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, when on my attempting to make a blundering kind of defence, for a con|duct my con&s;cience told me de&s;erved her indignation; &s;he very coolly and calmly acquitted me of all blame; &s;aid the in|con&s;tancy of men never in the lea&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ed her: &s;he was &s;orry my pa&s;&s;ion had been of &s;o very &s;hort a date; her's, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, might have held out &s;ome time longer, though that it would have come to end as mine had done, &s;he had not a doubt; was too generous to blame me for a fault which nature had intailed upon every &s;on and daughter of Adam; wi&s;hed me &s;ucce&s;s in my new amour, and concluded, by &s;aying, &s;ince our love is thus come to an untimely end, let us commence friends, and &s;ee how that will do.</P>
<P>This, Charles, or words to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was the &s;ub&s;tance of her lady|&s;hip's &s;peech&mdash;I was confounded&mdash;'twas &s;o wholly out of the common &s;tile, &s;o new, &s;o very whim&s;ical, that upon my &s;oul I looked like one doubtful whether to langh or cry; would you believe it? I felt a kind of di&s;appointment, a &s;ort of
<PB N="79" REF="78">mortification, at finding my&s;elf held &s;o confoundedly cheap.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf 'twas merely a feint, in order to recall me to my duty, and by no means the real dic|tates of her heart&mdash;but faith, &s;he keeps it up; not the &s;hadow of di&s;plea&s;ure have I had the con&s;olation to perceive in her from that time to this.</P>
<P>'Tis rather provoking, Charles, howe|ver convenient it may be to my future ope|rations; but I now begin to &s;u&s;pect I have been the dupe, and that &s;he never cared for me farther than to gratify her vani|ty; the devil's in it if &s;he could &s;o ea&s;ily have given me up; if &s;he had, what think you? Yet you need not &s;ub&s;cribe to that opinion, 'tis not quite &s;o plea&s;ant as one could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She bid me too not be &s;urpri&s;ed if I found her looking out for another <HI>Adonis</HI> to &s;upply my place, as &s;he could not exi&s;t without &s;omebody to &s;ay civil things to her&mdash;&s;o cool, &s;o cur&s;edly ea&s;y, Charles, I could cut my throat for having held &s;o de&s;picable an employment; not one tear, not even a &s;igh e&s;caped her&mdash;&s;o far from it, finding I was in no ha&s;te to leave her,
<PB N="80" REF="79">&s;he very compo&s;edly told me &s;he was go|ing to dre&s;s, &s;hould always be glad to &s;ee me, and wi&s;hed me a good morning.</P>
<P>Thus ends the &s;tory of me and my im|pertinent widow, and now for that of my divine Emily; and a wonderful &s;tory you'll &s;ay it is when I tell you, I begin to &s;u&s;pect it mu&s;t, in &s;pite of a thou&s;and ob&s;tacles, end in &s;ober, &s;erious matri|mony.&mdash;I &s;ee no other re&s;ource, Charles; &s;he is not the kind of per&s;on to whom one dare offer le&s;s honourable terms of capitulation. I &s;ee plainly, with her it mu&s;t be neck or nothing; and certainly if any woman can merit &s;uch a &s;acrifice, &s;he is to all intents and purpo&s;es that woman. Yet the thoughts of being fet|tered, not to mention the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and a year by the bargain, goes cur&s;edly again&s;t the grain; then what a triumph to that &s;piteful witch, who is to be &s;o great a gainer.</P>
<P>At &s;ome moments I am tempted to play the hero, and carry her off; but what next&mdash;the &s;cene which mu&s;t of cour&s;e follow &s;o glorious an atchieve|ment, does not appear very delightful. I will hone&s;tly confe&s;s, when I figure to
<PB N="81" REF="80">my&s;elf the dear girl, fainting, dying, di&s;tracted, and ju&s;tly accu&s;ing me as the author of all that mi&s;ery, I have not cou|rage to undertake it, unle&s;s I could per|&s;uade my&s;elf &s;he would conde&s;cend to pardon &s;uch a &s;tep, in con&s;ideration of the unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion which impel|led me to take it; and this I find no ea&s;y matter&mdash;a woman of virtue never can, and my Emily is pure and &s;potle&s;s as an angel, both in mind and per&s;on.</P>
<P>What's then to be done? It is a que&s;|tion not ea&s;ily an&s;wered, Charles; I have a&s;ked it of my&s;elf a thou&s;and times, but never could hit upon one in any degree &s;atisfactory; one expedient there is, and but one, which, if I can manage the point, may at lea&s;t remove part of my trouble, and no incon&s;iderable part nei|ther&mdash;it is this: Could I prevail on her to con&s;ent to a private marriage, and to conceal it 'till the patience of Lady Mary is exhau&s;ted, it might &s;ave me the mortification of &s;ee|ing my e&s;tate played the very devil with&mdash;for I cannot &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will &s;ubmit to lead apes, merely to plague me, fond as &s;he is of mi&s;chief. I would gladly hope
<PB N="82" REF="81">when &s;he finds &s;he can make nothing of me, &s;he will make a hu&s;band of &s;ome|body el&s;e, and that too before 'tis <HI>very</HI> long&mdash;there will certainly be no joke in playing the fool till &s;he is as grey as her grandmother; at lea&s;t if &s;he does carry it &s;o far, the laugh will be at her expence.</P>
<P>Now if I can bring my mind to fix on this plan, which is by no means clear yet, I do not ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of &s;uc|ce&s;s. My hopes of it are founded on two circum&s;tances, which I think have &s;ome weight.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t my beloved's hand is promi&s;ed by her father to a fellow, who, though rich as a jew, &s;he abhors. Her aunt, who has a convenient da&s;h of family pride in her compo&s;ition, is no le&s;s aver&s;e from the match than her lovely niece. The &s;econd is, that rather than give up the pro&s;pect of her being <HI>one day</HI> acknow|ledged the wife of a peer, &s;he would wait for that day, any rea&s;onable time, pro|vided the matter was made honourably certain&mdash;ambition is <HI>her</HI> hobby hor&s;e, this I di&s;covered before I had been an hour in her company, and to a view of this nature I impute the gracious recep|tion I met with.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82">If, therefore, I can bring my&s;elf to &s;wallow the bitter pill, and can al&s;o bring her over to my party, I think my ador|able will not be able to with&s;tand our united eloquences.</P>
<P>Had any one, Charles, &s;ix months ago&mdash;nay &s;ix week, told me I &s;hould now be talking thus &s;eriou&s;ly of matrimony, I &s;hould have given them little credit for their &s;kill in divination&mdash;yet, &s;o it is you &s;ee; judge then what an angel, what an irre&s;i&s;tible creature, my Emily mu&s;t be, who has in &s;o &s;hort a time wrought a miracle of this nature.&mdash;Love, Charles, all powerful love&mdash;<HI>Omnia vincit amor</HI>&mdash;there's all that can be &s;aid for it, and &s;o fare ye well&mdash;my next, may, probably, tell you on what I have finally re&s;olved&mdash;till then, and ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA, I have a thou&s;and things to tell you, would to heaven you were with me at this moment, not only to hear them; but to advi&s;e me, never in my life did I &s;tand more in need of an able coun|&s;ellor; I am perplexed, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and tormented with a thou&s;and fears&mdash;my Aunt&mdash;what &s;hall I &s;ay of her? I believe &s;he means well, nay, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly doubt it; yet, yet, my dear Sophia, <HI>I</HI> tremble at the very thoughts of a propo|&s;al, which <HI>&s;he</HI> neverthele&s;s con&s;ented to with joy.</P>
<P>Ah, if I &s;hould be prevailed upon, what will my dear father &s;ay? how &s;hall I ever after &s;uch a &s;tep, &s;o derogatory to female delicacy, have courage to look him or the world in the face? I cannot, <HI>cannot</HI> bring my&s;elf to follow her advice; indeed, I dare not do it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="84">
Yet, Sophia, let me blu&s;hing, confe&s;s my folly; my weak heart would tempt me to gratify her wi&s;hes, were I to li&s;ten to its dictates; but take the particulars, and then tell me, what you, my dear girl, would do were you in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I told you, in my la&s;t, Lord Sommer|ville had given me rea&s;on to look upon him as a lover; my Aunt, you may be|lieve, was highly delighted to find I had made a conque&s;t, &s;o perfectly con&s;onant to her ambitious de&s;ire; I verily believe, &s;he could hardly have been more &s;o, had &s;he her&s;elf been the object of his regard&mdash;He called upon, her ye&s;terday; I ob|&s;erved and embarra&s;&s;ment in his manner, a &s;omething I had never &s;een before, and could not now account for; it &s;truck me, it fluttered me exceedingly; I feared, I knew not what; my looks, I found, had betrayed my emotions, for he took my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, in the tendere&s;t accents, eagerly enquired if I was ill? glad he had given me that pre|tence, I &s;aid I had been teazed with a head ach all the morning.</P>
<P>Ah! my beloved Emily, would to hea|ven your Sommerville had no greater cau&s;e of complaint!</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="85">What do you mean, my Lord? (now more alarmed than ever!) for heaven fake! &s;peak, and tell me what occa&s;ions your di&s;tre&s;s! He then took a &s;eat be|tween my Aunt and me, &s;till holding my hand, and thus addre&s;&s;ed me: That I love you, my adorable Emily, I flatter my&s;elf, you cannot doubt. Love you with a tenderne&s;s which no language can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;cribe; that my whole hap|pine&s;s depends upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t invaluable of human hearts, and this dear hand; yet, &s;uch is my unhappy &s;ituation, that I fear to a&s;k that ble&s;&s;ing, without which life will be no longer de&s;irable.</P>
<P>As you may imagine, Sophia, I was much affected at this &s;peech, but remain|ed &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed, my Lord, (&s;aid my Aunt) if I take the liberty of &s;aying this di&s;cour&s;e is rather extraordinary; you could be no &s;tranger to the circum&s;tances you allude to, when you fir&s;t &s;aw my niece; was it then acting like a man of honour to attempt gaining her affections, <HI>&s;o circum&s;tanced?</HI> Mi&s;s Herbert, is not in a line of life to be trifled with, and&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">Ah! &s;pare me, my dear madam, nor injure me &s;o far as, to believe me capable of it; I know her ine&s;timable worth, I adore her, I honour her; &s;he is and ever mu&s;t be the &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of my heart.</P>
<P>I came now, madam, with full purpo&s;e to lay every &s;entiment of that <HI>heart</HI> before you, and al&s;o my very embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate, if I dur&s;t hope, when you are acquainted with it, you would not withdraw from me the favourable opinions you at pre&s;ent honour me with, I &s;hould look upon my|&s;elf as the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>He then told us, that his father had for &s;everal years before his death, projected an alliance between him and a cou&s;in of his own.&mdash;Sommerville was ever aver&s;e from the match; but as &s;he was then very young, he continually flattered him|&s;elf that time might produce &s;ome fa|vourable alteration, and that the affair might be dropped. He went abroad on his travels, his father died before his re|turn, and to his infinite &s;urpri&s;e, he found a clau&s;e in the will, binding him either to marry the lady or give up half his e&s;tate; and to add to the cruelty of his fate, &s;he was left free to reject <HI>him,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="87">though he had not the &s;ame indulgence. Ah! Sophia, too well they knew there was little danger of her taking advantage of that liberty; the too amiable Sommer|ville need never fear&mdash;or <HI>rather hope</HI> for a di&s;appointment of that nature.</P>
<P>This, my dear friend, is the &s;ub&s;tance of what he related.&mdash;I thought it needle&s;s to be more minute, as the &s;ubject is too pain&s;ul, to dwell upon longer than was nece&s;&s;ary to prepare you for what fol|lowed.</P>
<P>This, my dear Sophia, was a propo&s;al for me to con&s;ent to a private marriage, and to conceal it till we &s;aw whether time would not effect a change in the lady's &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Ah! never, never, my Lord! will I vo|luntarily con&s;ent to be your's at the ex|pence of another's happine&s;s, that other too the cho&s;en of your family, this con&s;i|detation independent of a thou&s;annd others mu&s;t determine me to reject your Lord|&s;hip's propo&s;al</P>
<P>Is the happine&s;s of your adoring Som|merville, then, &s;o very indifferent to you, my lovely Emily? that you &s;hould &s;o cruelly &s;acrifice it for that of a per&s;on
<PB N="89" REF="88">who is an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to you? For pity's &s;ake re&s;lect a moment! You cer|tainly have it in your power to render me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men; but by &s;o do|ing, believe me, you cannot promote, <HI>her</HI> felicity (&s;uppo&s;ing it depended on my giv|ing her my hand, which I am by no means per&s;uaded is the ca&s;e,) &s;ince I here &s;o|lemnly &s;wear, no woman, except your dear &s;elf, &s;hall ever po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>No! Mi&s;s Herbert, no! if you inflexibly per&s;i&s;t in &s;entiments &s;o injurious to my peace, to no other &s;hall it ever be offered. Then, turning to my aunt, ah, madam! dare I pre&s;ume to flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall find an advocate in you to plead my cau&s;e with your charming niece? He took her hand, and, putting one knee to the ground, continued, let me implore you, my generous friend, to u&s;e your influence in my favour.&mdash;I know it is great&mdash;I know my Emily pays the highe&s;t defer|ence to your judgment; on who&s;e, indeed, can &s;he with greater &s;ecurity rely? Speak then, for heaven's &s;ake! Say&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord, (interrupting him) I am ex|tremely concerned to learn you are &s;o un|fortunately circum&s;tanced; I feel for
<PB N="90" REF="89">your embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, but &s;till more for that of my niece, and wi&s;h it were in my power to extricate you both from your pre&s;ent difficulties; but how this can be effected without doing violence to that rule of conduct I have ever made it a point to be governed by, I really am at a lo&s;s to determine.&mdash;I certainly cannot thoroughly approve the plan your Lord|&s;hip is de&s;irous of pur&s;uing; yet I may, perhaps, on reflection, find it attended with le&s;s impropriety than it appears to be on a fir&s;t view: allow me then &s;ome time to take the affair into &s;erious con&s;i|deration, and believe it will give me mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, &s;hould I, after that, without fear of incurring the cen&s;ure of the world, be able to give your Lord&s;hip &s;uch an an&s;wer as you wi&s;h.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I, &s;aid he, (pre&s;&s;ing her hand to his lips with &s;ervour) find words to ex|pre&s;s a thou&s;andth part of the gratitude, with which my heart is replete, for this conde&s;cending goodne&s;s? You do not then bid me de&s;pair&mdash;Ah, my dear ma|dam! believe me it &s;hall be the future &s;tudy of my life to make you &s;en&s;ible this
<PB N="91" REF="90">genero&s;ity is-not thrown away on an in|grate.</P>
<P>My Emily (again placing him&s;elf by me) why tho&s;e averted eyes? Why tho&s;e cold, tho&s;e killing glances? Surely the pro&s;pect of felicity your Sommerville looks forward to, with &s;uch un&s;peakable rapture, cannot&mdash;?</P>
<P>My Lord, (interrupting him in myturn) though I am extremely &s;en&s;ible of my Aunt's kindne&s;s, I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve, I think &s;he will, on mature reflection, &s;ee &s;o many ob&s;tacles, &s;o much glaring impropriety in what you propo&s;e, that her an&s;wer cannot po&s;&s;ibly confirm tho&s;e hopes you indulge on &s;uch a &s;light foundation.</P>
<P>If my looks expre&s;s le&s;s plea&s;ure than your Lord&s;hip expects, believe me, it is becau&s;e I &s;ee more clearly than you will &s;uffer your&s;elf to do, that every hope, of the nature you mention, mu&s;t be fruit|le&s;s.</P>
<P>I have a father, my Lord, who is in|titled to every mark of re&s;pect and obe|dience, as far as I can pay it, without ren|dering my&s;elf ab&s;olutely wretched; and to that I would gladly believe he will ne|ver
<PB N="92" REF="91">compel me. <HI>That</HI> duty teaches me I ought not to engage in an affair of &s;uch infinite importance, without his know|ledge and approbation.</P>
<P>Emily, cried my aunt, though I mu&s;t approve the &s;entiments you have expre&s;|&s;ed; yet, in your &s;ituation, I will take upon me to &s;ay, I think they may, with|out a breach of duty, be di&s;pen&s;ed with; the per&s;ecution you have already &s;uffered too clearly convinces me you have little rea&s;on to expect that indulgence you talk of; were your father &s;uffered, indeed, to act according to his own ideas of recti|tude, perhaps you might avoid the horrid fate which now awaits you; but too well do you know this is not the ca&s;e; he has delegated his authority to one who is not di&s;po&s;ed to make a very generous u&s;e of it; from her you al&s;o know you have no|thing to expect but tyranny, as &s;he has a &s;oul de&s;titute of every &s;entiment of hu|manity.</P>
<P>Ah! &s;pare me, my dear madam! I am too &s;en&s;ible <HI>my</HI> happine&s;s or mi&s;ery are alike indifferent to <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>I could not refrain from tears, Sophia; the &s;ubject &s;he had &s;tarted quite over|powered
<PB N="93" REF="92">me&mdash;they fell in abundance on Sommerville's hand, in which mine was tenderly pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He was affected beyond expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;I begged they would permit me to retire, to which my Aunt readily a&s;&s;ented; but his Lord&s;hip &s;aid all the mo&s;t fervent pa&s;&s;ion could dictate, to &s;ooth, and prevail upon me to &s;tay&mdash;I left them however, and by what &s;he told me when we met again, after he had taken his leave, I found he had nearly gained his point with <HI>her</HI>; &s;ome &s;cruples, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, &s;till re|mained, yet they were overbalanced by the plea&s;ure &s;he felt at the thoughts of my being placed in &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a rank in life.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance &s;he endeavoured to paint in the mo&s;t &s;educing colours; &s;uch a triumph too, over my &s;tep-mother and her illiterate nephew. I own to you, Emily, my dear, the&s;e are motives which have great weight with me, &s;aid &s;he, and I think you too cannot be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible but that you mu&s;t feel &s;atisfaction in hav|ing &s;o glorious an opportunity to mortify one who has given you &s;o much unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and who you have abundant rea&s;on to
<PB N="94" REF="93">know will &s;tick at nothing to accompli&s;h the &s;cheme &s;he has &s;et her heart upon.</P>
<P>I certainly wi&s;h, my love, his Lord|&s;hip's affairs had been in &s;uch a &s;ituation as would have enabled him to marry you publicly, then would my utmo&s;t ambi|tion have been amply gratified; but &s;ince they are not, I advi&s;e you, by all means, to accept him on his own terms; the re|&s;traint he now lies under, cannot, in the nature of things, be of long duration; we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the Lady will live &s;ingle, merely with a view to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of a fortune &s;he is in no want of; depend upon it, when &s;he finds there are no hopes of gaining his Lord&s;hip's affec|tion, &s;he will look out for a more di&s;cern|ing lover, and you will then be introduc|ed into the world in &s;o flattering a &s;tile, that your father will not only pardon the part I have acted, but thank me for it mo&s;t &s;incerely.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Emily, my Lord is &s;o generous as never even to enquire what fortune he may expect with you; this is a noble proof of his love, nor &s;hall he lo&s;e by his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s; that &s;hall be my care, granting your fa|ther
<PB N="95" REF="94"> were inclined to take a mean avan|tage of it, which, I cannot however, be|lieve he would even think of.</P>
<P>I will not hurry you, my dear, take a rea&s;onable time for reflection on what is pa&s;t; of his Lord&s;hip's pa&s;&s;ion you can have no doubt; con&s;ult, then, your own heart, and if you find in it tho&s;e &s;enti|ments which you ought to feel for the man to whom you mean to give your hand, tell me freely, and I will be an|&s;werable for all the con&s;equences which may follow the &s;tep I advi&s;e you to take.</P>
<P>Had he made &s;uch a propo&s;al, indeed, without con&s;ulting me, I &s;hould have had an ill opinion of him; and you, my dear Emily, would have been unpardonable had you been prevailed upon to con&s;ent to it; but he has proved him&s;elf a man of honour, he has acted nobly, generou&s;ly, and with an openne&s;s and &s;incerity, for which he de&s;erves a proper return from us.</P>
<P>What could I an&s;wer to all this, So|phia? Alas! it coincided but too much with my own wi&s;hes to offer tho&s;e objec|tions I could and ought to have made; I was &s;ilent only, promi&s;ing a retro&s;pec|tion on it as &s;he de&s;ired.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="95">I have obeyed her mo&s;t faithfully, as you may well believe, for it is never one moment out of my thoughts, yet have I not courage to give the an&s;wer for which I am &s;o earne&s;tly importuned; &s;oon, however, I mu&s;t determine: how that will be, my next will probably inform you; till then, my dear friend, adieu.</P>

<P><PB N="97" REF="96">No matter how I came by my intelli|gence, I have more ways than one of div|ing to the bottom of all their &s;ecrets; for this affair, they are &s;tupid enough to ima|gine, is a profoumd one, and to remain &s;o for a certain time, for rea&s;ons which I confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To John Morton, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH per&s;onally a &s;tranger to Mr. Morton, I am well acquainted with his character, and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ituation in life; &s;uch is the high opinion I entertain of the former, that I cannot, without pain, &s;ee him on the point of being ba&s;e|ly robbed of the woman whom he ho|nours with his tendere&s;t affection, the
<PB N="100" REF="99">woman who&s;e hand he has been promi&s;|ed by tho&s;e who alone have a right to be|&s;tow it on him.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment of tho&s;e hopes you have formed, is, neverthele&s;s, preparing for you by the only per&s;on I pre&s;ume who can be an enemy to &s;o amiable a man as Mr. Morton; this you will rea|dily gue&s;s can be no other than Mrs. Grenville, aunt to the lovely Mi&s;s Her|bert; who, if left to follow the dictates of her own inclination, I well know would prefer you to the man this truly ridicu|lous woman has made choice of for her.</P>
<P>He has a title it is true, this is his only recommendation, &s;urely a very poor one to a mind of liberal &s;entiments; but of tho&s;e Mrs. Grenville is wholly de&s;titute. You cannot be ignorant of her character&mdash;it is a compound of pride and mean|ne&s;s; I tremble for the fate of my love|ly friend&mdash;&s;he trembles for her&s;elf, as &s;he &s;ees no po&s;&s;ible means to e&s;cape the threa|tened danger. Her aunt has contrived to get her into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and we now find it was wholly with a view to put her into that of this in&s;ignificant Lord.</P>
<P>As &s;he is denied the liberty of writ|ing to her friends on <HI>this</HI> &s;ubject, for &s;he
<PB N="101" REF="100">&s;ells me her aunt will not &s;uffer any let|ter to go without fir&s;t in&s;pecting its con|tents, &s;he is in ab&s;olute de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This, Sir, in&s;pired me with the idea of informing you of her danger, who are &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in it, and can alone relieve her; I con&s;efs I am at a lo&s;s to &s;ay how this mu&s;t, or can be done; one, and one way only appears to me practica|ble, and though a method I &s;hould high|ly di&s;approve in any other ca&s;e, I will yet venture to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, Sir, you will, rather than &s;ee the woman &s;o ju&s;tly dear to you, given to another, endeavour to fru&s;trate &s;uch a malicious intention, by <HI>any</HI> means, however de&s;perate; my plan is this: If you will &s;o di&s;gui&s;e your&s;elf as to prevent all po&s;&s;ible &s;u&s;picion, and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible come to me, having a carriage ready, and al&s;o a proper place where to convey the dear girl, I will undertake to have her at my hou&s;e at the time ap|pointed, from whence you may, with|out hazard, carry her off.</P>
<P>You will, by the &s;tep I have taken, judge how deeply I am intere&s;ted in the
<PB N="102" REF="101">happine&s;s of my amiable and truly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed friend. Mi&s;erable &s;he mu&s;t be if her vile ambitious Aunt &s;ucceeds in her pre&s;ent views, &s;ince &s;he abhors the man by her defrined to po&s;&s;e&s;s her. With you, who I am well a&s;&s;ured know her ine&s;ti|mable worth, and who adore her, &s;he can|not fail to enjoy that felicity &s;he &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erves.</P>
<P>This is the only adveie I have it in my power to offer, and I flatter my&s;elf it will meet your approbation, both for the gen|tle Emily's &s;ake and your own.</P>
<P>It hurts my feelings to think a man of your character and fortune &s;hould be in|jured in &s;o tender a point; and that an in&s;ignificant boy, merely becau&s;e he has a title, &s;hould thus triumph over you. I think, by what I know of Mr. Morton's &s;pirit, he will not tamely put up with &s;uch an indignity.</P>
<P>Let me know what my poor friend has to expect as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; &s;ince there is not a moment to lo&s;e, if you wi&s;h to &s;ave her from inevitable mi&s;ery, or to po&s;&s;e&s;s the object of your affection.&mdash;</P>

<P>Farewell; I every moment expect the fellow's an&s;wer! and then, &s;hould he agree to my &s;cheme, I mu&s;t contrive to get the girl here; this, indeed, will be no hard matter, as her Aunt is never bet|ter plea&s;ed than when I honour her with any degree of attention.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t a&s;k you once more, have I not a wonderful command over my pa&s;&s;ions?

<P>PREPARE your congratulations, Char|les!&mdash;the adorable Emily will &s;oon be mine!&mdash;mine by every tender, every &s;o|lemn tie! What a miracle has her num|berle&s;s perfections wrought on the once volatile mind of your friend Sommerville? He now talks of matrimony with as grave a countenance, as if he were an old prac|titioner in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Yes, Charles, nothing is now wanting but the nuptial benediction to complete my wonderful transformation; my mind is made up, there was no getting my beloved on any other terms, and to give her up was death; and after all, what does it &s;ignify; one mu&s;t marry &s;ome time or other, why then delay it?</P>
<P>Have I then, you'll a&s;k, &s;ettled matters amicably with my cou&s;in?&mdash;Don't mi&s;|take me!&mdash;&s;he is to know nothing of the
<PB N="105" REF="104">matter, nor any body el&s;e except your wor|&s;hip and the parties concerned; that is to &s;ay, my charmer, her Aunt (to whom, by the by, I owe my &s;ucce&s;s) and your hum|ble &s;ervant; without that kind Lady's interpo&s;ition, I am &s;en&s;ible I never &s;hould have prevailed on the engaging Emily; but through her &s;agacious arguments (though mine could not get the better of her delicate &s;cruples) &s;he has con&s;ented to keep our union a &s;ecret for &s;ome time, per&s;uaded no le&s;s than my&s;elf, that Lady Mary Craven's patience will not hold out much longer.</P>
<P>And if the wor&s;t happens, namely, that &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover it, &s;he can but claim her legacy&mdash;a devli&s;h &s;lice it will cut off my e&s;tate, Charles, that's certain; but there's no help; I would rather &s;ubmit to carry a mu&s;ket than be tied to her for life&mdash;this, however, &s;he cannot claim, till I have in plain terms refu&s;ed her, or am married to another&mdash;now <HI>&s;he</HI> has not yet, you &s;ee, a&s;ked me the que&s;tion, and if &s;he waits till <HI>I</HI> a&s;k her, our affairs are likely to remain in <HI>&s;tatu quo.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent all po&s;&s;ible &s;u&s;picion, my beloved is to continue with her Aunt till &s;uch time as I can publicly acknowledge
<PB N="106" REF="105">her&mdash;and &s;hould her father make any di&s;turbance, and in&s;i&s;t on her returning home, Mrs. Grenville has taken upon her&s;elf to make that matter ea&s;y by ac|quainting him with the whole truth, not doubting but he will be mighty well plea&s;ed to find &s;he has di&s;pofed of her in a manner &s;o much more eligible, in every re&s;pect than he intended to do him|&s;elf; &s;ince it was merely for the &s;ake of a quiet life he ever con&s;ented to a match he by no means approved.</P>
<P>See what it is, Charles, to have a &s;hrew of a wife&mdash;but a wife like the gentle Emily&mdash;aye, that is quite another affair, and three days hence your friend will have that ble&s;&s;ing to boa&s;t of&mdash;yet, no boa&s;ting, I forgot that&mdash;Well a time will &s;hortly come, I hope, when I may pro|claim to all the world my unbounded happine&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Stanley-Place.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>GIVE me joy, Caroline! All is over, and I am beyond expre&s;&s;ion delighted with my handy-work.</P>
<P>No, po&s;itively there never was my equal; nor a &s;et of &s;tupid mortals &s;o completely outwitted. I could expire with laughing when I figure to my&s;elf their con&s;ternation.&mdash;If you do not &s;ee it in the &s;ame ridiculous light, it appears
<PB N="108" REF="107">to me in, I would not give a &s;traw for your feelings.</P>
<P>My doughty hero &s;wallowed the bait I threw out with the avidity of a gud|geon.&mdash;His an&s;wer was exactly what I wi&s;hed&mdash;he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts, how|ever, in regard to the dam&s;el's being pre|judiced in his favour. And well he might, for &s;he dete&s;ted his very name, and had ever u&s;ed him accordingly.&mdash;So much the better, I tru&s;t he will now repay her in kind.&mdash;But though he had doubts of the <HI>&s;incerity of her pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> of his own he had none, for he &s;wore mo&s;t manfully he would carry her off at the hazard both of <HI>&s;oul and body</HI> rather than forego his hopes.</P>
<P>Bravo, cried I, as I peru&s;ed his &s;crawl. This is the very man I want, it would be &s;urprizing, with &s;uch <HI>noble &s;pirits</HI> as we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, we &s;hould not play the deuce before 'tis long.</P>
<P>The happy pair were to have been fet|tered as la&s;t Tue&s;day.&mdash;Every thing was finally &s;ettled. Mi&s;s was to remain <HI>as a Mi&s;s,</HI> with her plotting Aunt.&mdash;So happy &s;o elate, I'll warrant ye, with their ima|gined dignity.&mdash;O dear! O dear!</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108">Well, child, I had called ore fre|quently on them than u&s;ual for &s;ome time pa&s;t.&mdash;My <HI>Lady&s;hip always did them honour</HI>; the evening before the day of days, my &s;aid Lady&s;hip was &s;eized with a violent headach, a card was di&s;patched, intreating the favour of Mi&s;s Herbert's company, for an hour, to accompany me in a walk, as I thought the air might, po&s;&s;ibly remove it.&mdash;No refu&s;ing her <HI>Lady&s;hip's</HI> reque&s;t.&mdash;She came&mdash;away we &s;trolled.&mdash;But alas! alas! had not proceeded a quan|ter of a mile, before we were terrified by the approach of four ill looking fel|lows making directly towards us.&mdash;<HI>I</HI> &s;creamed, calling on all the gods and god|de&s;&s;es for protection; &s;he, more courage|ous, begged me not to be alarmed, they could not mean us any injury.&mdash;A mo|ment &s;erved to undeceive her, for before you could count twenty, Madam was wi&s;k'd up by one of them, carried to the carriage prepared for her reception, and away it flew like lightening.</P>
<P>I now made the be&s;t of my way home, my heart as light as a feather, but my outward appearance in a &s;tate of di&s;trac|tion&mdash;fit &s;ucceeded fit, my &s;ervants frightened out of their &s;en&s;es, begging to
<PB N="110" REF="109">know what had reduced me to &s;uch a de|plorable condition; it was an hour before I was &s;ufficiently recovered to gratify their curio&s;ity; at length I accompli&s;hed it, <HI>and</HI> amazement followed of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To keep up the farce I was put to bed extremely ill&mdash;had not courage enough to inform Mrs. Grenville of the di&s;a&s;ter&mdash;no hurry for that you know.</P>
<P>At length comes her carriage to convey Mi&s;s Herbert home. What was now to be done? Why, my woman was compel|led to be the relater of the melancholy &s;tory. I ordered her to go in it, and to give the be&s;t account of the matter &s;he could; and above all, to de&s;cribe the la|mentable &s;tate in which &s;he had left me, by way of apology for not waiting on her my&s;elf. All this &s;he would do perfectly well, as &s;he had not an idea that the whole was a concerted plot.</P>
<P>It was now the old &s;oul's turn to be di&s;tracted in earne&s;t. Never was &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion as Wil&s;on was witne&s;s to; and to crown the whole, in the mid&s;t of her de&s;pair, and before my abigail had quite fini&s;hed the ta&s;k impo&s;ed upon her, in comes Sommerville.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">Ah! What would I not have given to have &s;een his frantic behaviour? I envied her, and &s;incerely wi&s;hed I could my&s;elf, with propriety, have related to them the delightful particulars, but that was impo&s;|&s;ible. He raved, he &s;tormed, he cur&s;ed; and, as in duty bound, vowed he would never re&s;t till he had di&s;covered the vil|lain who had robbed him of his heart's deare&s;t trea&s;ure! The&s;e were his Lord|&s;hip's very words, &s;aid Wil&s;on, while giving me an account of what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Why, to be &s;ure, my Lady, he mu&s;t have quite doated upon her, as one may &s;ay; and to be &s;ure, &s;he was a mightly pretty creature. But yet to take on &s;o for one who was only an acquaintance like, amazed me; for had &s;he been his own wife, I verily <HI>thinks</HI> he could not have been in a greater taking.</P>
<P>No, nor perhaps half &s;o great, few men look upon the lo&s;s of a wife as any vio|lent affliction.</P>
<P>Fearing to betray my real feelings, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my maid; when, in a few mi|nutes after, comes Mrs. Grenville, beg|ging, for heaven's &s;ake! I would allow her the honour of a moment's conver&s;ation,
<PB N="112" REF="111">that &s;he might learn the di&s;tracting parti|culars from my own lips. This I could not decently refu&s;e, &s;o up &s;he came to my bedchamber.</P>
<P>Oh! Lady Stanley, I am the mo&s;t wretched of women! My poor dear child! What mu&s;t &s;he now &s;uffer to be thus torn from her friends, thus expo&s;ed to a thou|&s;and in&s;ults? Alas! I cannot &s;upport this dreadful &s;hock.</P>
<P>And &s;till more dreadful di&s;appointment of all my high rai&s;ed hopes, &s;he would have &s;aid, I pre&s;ume, Caroline, had &s;he been hone&s;t enough to &s;peak her mind freely.</P>
<P>I pity you from my &s;oul, my dear ma|dam; if I feel this horrid affair thus &s;en|&s;ibly, what mu&s;t you do, who are &s;o near|ly connected with the amiable girl? Have you no idea who it can be, that has dared to commit this horrid outrage.</P>
<P>None in the world; I can form no con|jecture, and it is that di&s;tre&s;&s;es me. I came now principally to a&s;k if your Lady&s;hip can give me any intelligence of the road they took, or any particular de&s;cription of the villains, that I may as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible &s;end in pur&s;uit of them. Lord

<P>I am per&s;uaded, my dear madam, he will do it with plea&s;ure; he is really a very worthy young man, and alway, pro|fe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t e&s;teem for my amiable friend Mi&s;s Herbert.</P>

<P>KEEP your congratulations, Charles, for &s;ome happier fellow! I am at this mo|ment completely wretched!&mdash;Never was there &s;o unaccountable, &s;o cur&s;ed an af|fair.&mdash;I have almo&s;t turned my brain by fruitle&s;s conjectures, my mind is in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute di&s;traction, my body &s;inking under the fatigue I have &s;uffered.&mdash;Faith, I almo&s;t blu&s;h to explain my&s;elf more clearly, I feel my&s;elf humbled &s;o confoundedly.</P>
<P>Ah! could I but learn by whom, I would take ample vengeance for the in|jury; the indignity I have&mdash;But no more
<PB N="116" REF="115">threats till fortune puts it in my power to realize them; then, Charles, call me a paltroon if I am wor&s;e than my word.</P>
<P>Know then, that the very day preced|ing that on which my angel, Emily, had promi&s;ed to make me the happie&s;t of men, while &s;he was taking the air with Lady Stanley, &s;he was &s;eized by three or four villains, and carried off.</P>
<P>This, Charles, is the horrible &s;tory in few words. Where, or by whom, the Lord only knows, for not the lea&s;t infor|mation have I yet been able to gain, though I have made it my whole bu&s;ine&s;s, as you may well believe, from the cur&s;ed mo|ment. I have not had an hour's re&s;t &s;ince the affair happened; on hor&s;eback for ever, enquiring at every &s;tage, every inn, of every &s;oul I meet; yet, how de&s;cribe what I am in que&s;t of?&mdash;One carriage &s;o like another, and hundreds pa&s;&s;ing in all directions.&mdash;I am frequently taken for a lunatic, nor are they far mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Oh, Charles, can you form an idea of a more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, more mortifying &s;itua|tion; on the very eve of enjoying the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s&mdash;my Emily, all engaging, mode&s;t tenderne&s;s&mdash;by hea|ven
<PB N="117" REF="116">it is too much!&mdash;It unman's me quite, but for the rage which animates me, and the glorious hopes that I &s;hall yet be able to di&s;cover the wretch who has thus bla&s;t|ed all my pro&s;pects of felicity, I &s;hould &s;ink under my affliction.</P>
<P>At &s;ome moments I have been tempt|ed to &s;u&s;pect Lady Stanley; I know &s;he has a &s;oul capable of any thing, however inhuman&mdash;I know it well&mdash;yet, I believe, I &s;hould injure her; &s;he was confined for &s;ome days by the &s;hock &s;he received, &s;poke of it with unfeigned concern to Mrs. Grenville, and was apparently lit|tle le&s;s afflicted than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I know not what to think; I am per|plexed, bewildered in a variety of fruit|le&s;s conjectures; perhaps her father&mdash;yet that is ridiculous; why have recour&s;e to &s;tratagem, when he might have order|ed her home whenever he plea&s;ed? And, as for the fellow to whom he had pro|mi&s;ed her, he, for that very rea&s;on, could have no inducement to play the knight-errant; he was favoured by her friends, nay, looked upon her as his own.</P>
<P>Yet, Charles, it occurs to me at this in&s;tant, he might po&s;&s;ibly, though I can|not

<P>By heavens! this is the only idea that has yet &s;truck me with any appearance of probability.</P>
<P>But then, again, why this force? Why not prevail on her father to &s;end for her home, and according to his promi&s;e give her to him?&mdash;Would not this have been a more natural plan? No doubt of it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as I &s;aid, I am in a labyrinth, and ab&s;olutely unable to determine which way to bend my cour&s;e next. I write this, while my hor&s;es are re&s;ting, for my own part I can take none&mdash;they are ready&mdash;Farewell.</P>

<P>SOMMERVILLE has commenced Quixotte, and is galloping all over the country in que&s;t of his Dulcinea; the Grenvilles and Herberts all out on the &s;ame wild goo&s;e cha&s;e&mdash;air and exerci&s;e will do the good &s;culs a world of &s;ervice; in the mean time my hero is quietly en|joying the fruit of his labour.</P>
<P>Yet, not very quietly, neither, for I find Mi&s;s is rather re&s;ractory, and by what he &s;ays, I begin to &s;u&s;pect he wi&s;hes he were fairly quit of her, or that he had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prize by more ju&s;ti|fiable means.</P>
<P>The fellow's a fool, and of cour&s;e has not a &s;pirit equal to the ta&s;k I have a&s;&s;igned him; but that's his affar. I have brought him into the &s;crape, it is his bu|&s;ine&s;s to get out of it the be&s;t way he can.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, he has wrote to me, begging my further advice how to pro|ceed;
<PB N="120" REF="119">I have not yet, nor am I clear that I ever &s;hall take the trouble to give it; certainly not, unle&s;s I find on reflection, I can &s;trike out any thing new or likely to afford me a little more diver&s;ion. He de&s;cribes her terrors, on finding her&s;elf thus kidnapped, in a &s;tyle that plainly &s;ays he is not a little terrified him&s;elf, for what may be the con&s;equences of his va|lourous atchievement. To &s;ay truth, they may be rather &s;erious, but this he ought to have fore&s;een.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, in his vile &s;crawl, for the wretch can hardly write legibly, that he had at fir&s;t intended carrying her home to her father's&mdash;but on finding &s;he freely declared no power on earth &s;hould ever compel her to give him her hand! That &s;he abhorred him! That death in any &s;hape would be infinitely preferable to her than being united to a villain who had dared to in&s;ult her in the manner he had done! He was &s;o highly provoked, and at the &s;ame time fearing her father, on finding her &s;o re&s;olutely determined a|gain&s;t him, might retract his promi&s;e, that he, in an <HI>evilhour,</HI> re&s;olved to convey her to a hou&s;e of his own, and there to treat
<PB N="121" REF="120">her with le&s;s ceremony than he had hi|therto done in revenge for the contempt with which &s;he had <HI>treated</HI> him.</P>
<P>He at once put his plan in execution, &s;o that he had her now intirely in his power; but with the violence of her agi|tations &s;he had thrown her&s;elf into a &s;e|ver; was at the moment he wrote deli|rious, and by the doctors pronounced in the utmo&s;t danger.</P>
<Q>After the fatal &s;tep I have taken (adds he) it is not in the nature of things I can inform her family of what has happened; this would be &s;etting my&s;elf in no very favourable light, and all my hopes mu&s;t then be at an end, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible they can pardon this outrage; gladly would I marry her, even now, though convinced her heart is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, could I thereby get honourably out of this confounded trouble; &s;hould &s;he die, and, if I may believe the phy&s;ici|ans, her recovery is very doubtful, I &s;hall have rea&s;on to cur&s;e the day I ever &s;et eyes on her.</Q>
<P>He then, Caroline, implores me to write in&s;tantly, and tell him what I would ad|vi&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="121">him to do. Were I to give him any advice it &s;hould be to hang him&s;elf at once, both for his own &s;ake and mine.</P>
<P>The fellow's an errant coward, it is evident, and of cour&s;e may be tempted by his fears to <HI>impeach</HI>; yet, as <HI>I</HI> am not, let him do his wor&s;t, with all my &s;oul. The letter I wrote on the &s;ubject is all he has to produce again&s;t me, and it is wrote in &s;o <HI>friendly</HI> a &s;tile, &s;o con&s;onant to the wi&s;hes of all her family, except the old Aunt, that I think it will acquit me of any evil intention, did I care any thing about it. But the truth is, I do not.&mdash;What are the animals to me? If the girl will be &s;uch a &s;impleton as to fret her|&s;elf to death, who can help it.</P>
<P>Had &s;he not robbed me of the only man who ever had power to gain my affections, &s;he might, for ought I cared, have flirted on to the end of the chapter, with every other &s;he could find fooli&s;h enough to think it worth their while. But to rival me there! To rob me by her&mdash;heaven knows what, Caroline!&mdash;Of a <HI>Sommer|ville!</HI>&mdash;It was not to be borne.</P>
<P>Ah! death is too gentle a puni&s;hment; let her die then, and let the fellow make the be&s;t of the &s;tory he can.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="122">The &s;illy whim over, Sommerville may again be mine. Heavens! the very hope of &s;uch an event gives me new life, nor is it in any degree improbable; a &s;hort time mu&s;t convince him of the difference between an ignorant country girl, and a woman of the world, who knows how to &s;et a proper value on his merit and ac|compli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It was a whim, Caroline, a mere whim of the moment; I have not a doubt he will &s;oon conquer it, and return to me a true penitent. I will not humble my&s;elf &s;o far as to make a compari&s;on between her per&s;onal attractions and mine; and, as to her under&s;tanding, it would be &s;till more ridiculous.</P>

<P>THE wandering knight, Caroline, is returned&mdash;but what a change! He is ab|&s;olutely worn to a &s;hadow; looks like the gho&s;t of his former bewitching &s;elf, and appears in the deepe&s;t de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I have only &s;een him <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI>; think of that&mdash;not once called upon me, though I conde&s;cended to write him a note to enquire after his health; a cool card, with compliments, was all the return I got.&mdash;I was weak enough to write a &s;e|cond time, and, I fear, with a degree of tenderne&s;s, for which I now dete&s;t my|&s;elf.

<P>I believed, indeed, he had a pa&s;&s;ion for her, which as he could not contrive to gratify on any other terms, he, in a fit of de&s;peration had agreed to it; but that it was, by no means, &s;o rooted in his brea&s;t <HI>as</HI> to produce the effect I am now a wit|ne&s;s to.</P>

<P><HI>My Lord,</HI></P>
<P>IN pity to an amiable young creature, in who&s;e happine&s;s I know your Lord&s;hip is greatly intere&s;ted, I take up my pen, and tru&s;t my motive will plead my excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I have been an unwilling &s;pectator to a &s;cene of &s;uch complete villainy, that my heart bleeds when I think of it.</P>
<P>I blu&s;h to &s;ay I am hou&s;e-keeper to the wretch of who&s;e unexampled trea|chery I am now going to give an ac|count.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t have heard Mi&s;s Herbert &s;peak of Mr. Morton&mdash;<HI>he</HI> is the man who has, by an unheard-of piece of cruelty, for ever de&s;troyed her peace, and of cour&s;e Lord Sommerville's; for I am not to learn the happy event which was to have taken place, had he not ba&s;e|ly robbed you of her.</P>
<P>She has, by the injurious treatment &s;he has received, been reduced to the point of death; and no wonder, &s;ince lo&s;s of honour to a mind pure as hers,
<PB N="128" REF="127">was, I doubt not, infinitely more dread|ful.</P>
<P>Though now in this humble &s;tation, I have &s;een better days, my Lord.&mdash;I felt for&mdash;I pitied her di&s;tre&s;s, and only regret it was not in my power to &s;ave her from ruin&mdash;Alas! it was not&mdash;&s;he was too nar|rowly watched by the mon&s;ter who has undone her.&mdash;But finding to what a con|dition his brutality had reduced her, he was compelled to put her under my care.</P>
<P>I have the &s;atisfaction to inform your Lord&s;hip, that care has not been in vain; &s;he is, at length, out of danger, and I hope will &s;hortly be able to leave this dete&s;ted hou&s;e, could I contrive to find any way for her to e&s;cape&mdash;I offered to write to her parents&mdash;"Ah! never! &s;he cried, never can I &s;ee them more! No&mdash;get me but out of this wretch's power, and I will, in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner, hide my mi&s;erable head! and tru&s;t death will &s;oon, in tender compa&s;&s;ion to my un&s;peak|able mi&s;ery, put an end to my days!"</P>
<P>I would al&s;o have offered to write to you, my Lord, but judged &s;he would be &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more aver&s;e from that.
<PB N="129" REF="128">I have ventured, therefore, to do it with|out her knowledge, not doubting but you will find means to deliver her, and to pu|ni&s;h the wretch who has thus de&s;troyed the happy pro&s;pect which awaited you.</P>

<P>What do you think of madam hou&s;e|keeper, Caroline?&mdash;Don't you think her letter will produce &s;ome rather <HI>un|plea&s;ant</HI> feelings in the gentle bo&s;om of our de&s;pairing &s;wain. I flatter my&s;elf the account &s;he has given him, will, on this occa&s;ion, at lea&s;t put his <HI>matrimonial</HI> whim out of his head, and may be the means of his getting him&s;elf run through the body into the bargain; for a tilting bout there mu&s;t be or the deuce is in it; &s;hould he come off conqueror, my hone&s;t friend, the Nabob, mu&s;t even &s;ubmit to the operation him&s;elf&mdash;no great matter which; and as to the dam&s;el, we mu&s;t leave her future fate to chance; I think it does not promi&s;e to be any longer en|viable.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129">I have contrived to &s;end the fine epi&s;|tle to him, by &s;uch a conveyance as &s;hall leave him no po&s;&s;ible doubt of its authen|ticity, and expect to &s;ee him gallop off full &s;peed, as &s;oon as he has properly di|ge&s;ted its contents&mdash;dearly do I love a lit|tle innocent mi&s;chief&mdash;and this is <HI>perfectly &s;o,</HI> you'll allow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>London.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been engaged in a mo&s;t won|derful piece of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ince my la&s;t, Charles, which has produced a total re|volution in my &s;ober matrimonial &s;cheme, as you will readily conceive when in|formed of the infernal particulars&mdash;no fault of mine, you mu&s;t allow, if I am compelled to take to my old cour&s;es again. I was on the point of reforma|tion, but fate forbids, and to that I mu&s;t &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>After having made every po&s;&s;ible en|quiry after my adorable Emily, to no pur|po&s;e, I returned in a truly di&s;con&s;olate condition to my regiment; Lady Stanley, on my arrival, &s;ent to enquire for me, wondering, I pre&s;ume, I had not called upon her. I was in no humour for it, and &s;ent a very cool an&s;wer. This pro|duced a &s;econd note, but wrote in a &s;tyle
<PB N="132" REF="131">which very clearly convinced me &s;he not only wi&s;hed for my company, but hoped I would put it in her power to con&s;ole me for the lo&s;s of my beloved&mdash;I have no longer a doubt that the airs of indiffer|ence &s;he had thought proper to a&s;&s;ume, on finding my attachment for her&s;elf at an end, were put on merely to conceal her mortification; it mu&s;t be owned it was of very &s;hort duration; but all her conde&s;cen&s;ion was thrown away upon me; I could not, for the &s;oul of me, in the humour I was, take the trouble to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>What change time might have effected, I know not, but a letter I got, of which I inclo&s;e you a copy, put her as much out of my head as if no &s;uch per&s;on had ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>I will now, Charles, &s;uppo&s;e you have read it&mdash;judge, then, of my feelings, on finding the horrid intelligence it brought me.</P>
<P>'Till then, I had never been wholly without my &s;u&s;picions of the widow; but at length compelled to acquit her, as &s;he knew nothing of the &s;coundrel who has been the author of all this mi&s;ery.
<PB N="133" REF="132">He is now, however, &s;marting for his temerity, and will not, a &s;econd time, I fancy be ea&s;ily tempted to play the hero in &s;uch an adventure. I think I have made him pay pretty hand&s;omely for his frolic! By heavens! when I think of the &s;ufferings of the gentle Emily! (that dear object of my tendere&s;t, my everla&s;ting affection) I am almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and could inflict a thou&s;and deaths, in&s;tead of one, on the vile wretch who has &s;o cru|elly betrayed the innocence he ought to have protected. But no more of this; I will, if po&s;&s;ible, proceed in my narra|tive.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly &s;at off, attended by a cou|ple of &s;ervants, on who&s;e courage and fidelity I could depend; determined to re&s;cue my dear girl from the power of the mon&s;ter who had thus undone us both, and &s;everely puni&s;h him for his infamous conduct.</P>
<P>I left my carriage at a little di&s;tance, and mounting one of my &s;ervants hor&s;es, bidding the other follow me, rode up to the hou&s;e.&mdash;A fellow was &s;tanding at the gate&mdash;I demanded if his ma&s;ter was at home, to which he replied in the affir|mative;
<PB N="134" REF="133">then a&s;ked who he &s;hould an|nounce.</P>
<P>No matter, &s;hew me in directly; he led the way into a parlour, and then went to inform his ma&s;ter, who in a few mi|nutes, made his appearance.</P>
<P>Whether he gue&s;&s;ed my bu&s;ine&s;s, I know not, as he was a &s;tranger to my per&s;on; but I did not leave him long at a lo&s;s&mdash;I had my pi&s;tols ready, which he no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes upon, than a guil|ty con&s;cience informed him at once of my purpo&s;e; and like a coward as he is, he made an effort to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>This I prevented by &s;etting my back again&s;t he door; he now began to blu&s;ter, and a&s;ked what I meant by daring to in|&s;ult him in his own hou&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P>I mean to puni&s;h a mo&s;t con&s;ummate villain, and you are the man! If not a coward as well as a <HI>villain</HI> take your choice of the&s;e pi&s;tols, and be thankful I give you &s;o honourable a chance for pre&s;erving your worthle&s;s exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Still affecting to look bold (though he trembled in every joint.) And pray who are you that thus pre&s;umes to put my life in danger?</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="134">Oh! no matter <HI>who</HI>; and as to the <HI>why,</HI> you can be at no lo&s;s to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;till drew back, refu&s;ing to accept my offer. Finding, however, nothing le&s;s would do, he at la&s;t took one, and (&s;carce giving me time to lay hold of the other) fired and mi&s;&s;ed me; I now fired in my turn, and had the con&s;olation to lodge the ball in his body.</P>
<P>The report alarmed the family, and a number of &s;ervants a&s;&s;embled; take care of your ma&s;ter, &s;aid I; then &s;eizing one of them by the arm, I ordered him to &s;hew me in&s;tantly to the apartment of the lady who was by violence detained there, unle&s;s he wi&s;hed I &s;hould treat him as I had done his &s;coundrel of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The choice I had given him, was ea&s;ily decided, and he immediately cried out, this way, plea&s;e your <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Charles, all language mu&s;t fail me!&mdash;My Emily, no doubt, terrified by the confu&s;ion &s;he had heard, lay life|le&s;s on the floor, without a &s;oul to afford her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I rung the bell in an agony it is im|po&s;&s;ible to give you an idea of&mdash;I believed
<PB N="136" REF="135">her gone for ever, as not a &s;ymptom of life appeared. A woman came in, ter|ror and amazement depicted in her coun|tenance&mdash;I ordered her to call for help, and to procure whatever &s;he judged mo&s;t likely to re&s;tore my angel. I had, before I went up &s;tairs, di&s;patched my &s;ervant to bring my carriage to the door; it ar|rived in a few minutes, but all our efforts were ineffectual, &s;he &s;hewed no &s;igns of life; I then judged the air might be of more &s;ervice to her than all their drops, &amp;c. &amp;c. in ca&s;e &s;he was not ab&s;olutely pa&s;t recovery.</P>
<P>Lifting the dear girl, therefore, in my arms, and leaning her pale (though &s;till infinitely lovely) face on my bo&s;om, I carried her gently to the chai&s;e, and put|ting her in, took my &s;eat by her, and bidding the po&s;tillion drive &s;lowly on, left the cur&s;ed crew in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;h|ment at what had pa&s;&s;ed, which there is no de&s;cribing; they &s;tood gaping with open mouths, and every mark of &s;tupid amazement, not one of them having had courage to offer any re&s;i&s;tance to my un|dertaking&mdash;Indeed the whole took up &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time that they had not
<PB N="137" REF="136">got over their &s;urprize, nor had they re|covered the u&s;e of the little &s;en&s;e nature had given them when I left them.</P>
<P>I now endeavoured by a thou&s;and ten|der care&s;&s;es, to re&s;tore my beloved; and, to my unutterable joy, at length per|ceived &s;he began to open her languid eyes.</P>
<P>Oh, Charles! gue&s;s, if you can, what was my rapture at that ble&s;&s;ed moment&mdash;My Emily! My angel! (cried I) in an ec&s;tacy, look up, my be&s;t beloved! Ba|ni&s;h all your fears! and behold your Sommerville, who&s;e whole happine&s;s de|pends upon your recovery. She now &s;ighed deeply, and a few tears fell from her eyes on my bo&s;om, which &s;upported her; my hopes began to revive, this I thought a favourable &s;ymptom, and I was not deceived.</P>
<P>Alas! where am I? &s;aid &s;he at la&s;t; but, in &s;o faint a voice, I could &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h her words.&mdash;Oh, Save me! &s;ave me from him! And &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>I gently pre&s;&s;ed her to my throbbing heart&mdash;be comforted my Emily, you are no longer in the power of the wretch
<PB N="138" REF="137">who&s;e pre&s;ence you &s;o ju&s;tly dread; it is your Sommerville, it is the mo&s;t ten|der of lovers, who implores, who intreats you to calm your agitation.</P>
<P>Sommerville! exclaimed &s;he&mdash;Som|merville!&mdash;good heavens! am I awake! may I believe my &s;en&s;es? And again her dear head, which &s;he had made an effort to rai&s;e, &s;unk on my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>It is! it is your Sommerville, my be&s;t beloved! Who has been the happy means of delivering you from the power of a villain, and who now with tran&s;port folds you to his bo&s;om!</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord!

Alas! my Lord, you know not the terrors I have indured!&mdash;Ah, Charles! too well I knew them for my peace!</P>
<P>Think no more of it, my angel; en|deavour to forget the pa&s;t and look only forward to &s;cenes of happine&s;s; for hap|py you &s;hall be if it is in the power of the mo&s;t faithful, the mo&s;t ardent of lo|vers to make you &s;o!</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138">Oh! my Lord, I have a thou&s;and things to tell you, a thou&s;and que&s;tions to a&s;k; but am &s;till &s;o weak! &s;o very faint! that I have not power to utter them&mdash;of this, however, be a&s;&s;ured, my heart is perfect|ly grateful for the important &s;ervice you have &s;o generou&s;ly, &s;o nobly conferred upon me; my family too will join their thanks to mine for &s;o infinite an obligati|on. Ah! they will now be convinced, the man they &s;o highly favoured, was a de&s;picable wretch; he has given but too fatal proofs of it.</P>
<P>My poor dear Aunt too&mdash;I dread to a&s;k, my Lord, what effect the &s;hock had upon her? But I &s;hall &s;oon, I hope, have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her; of removing all her apprehen&s;ions; this delightful thought has given me new life; I am better, my Lord, much better; pray order the &s;er|vant to drive on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, indeed, I can bear it now. Gracious heaven! how will her kind heart rejoice to have me thus re&s;tored to her at the moment, perhaps, when &s;he wholly de&s;paired of it?</P>
<P>If I now, Charles, feared her impati|ence, and violent emotions of joy, might
<PB N="140" REF="139">be too much for her &s;till weak &s;pirits; how then have courage to tell her I had no de&s;ign to put her again under her Aunt's protection?&mdash;A thought, however, in&s;tantly &s;truck me.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grenville, my deare&s;t Emily, is no longer in the country, bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance obliged her to go to London &s;oon after the &s;hock you mention, and a &s;evere one it was; you will have no ob|jections then, my love, to join her there, as it is a &s;horter journey than going to your father's &s;eat. Indeed, I ventured to re&s;olve on this plan before you were in a condition to give me your opinion of it, judging it would be more agreeable to you; we are now on our way thither, and &s;hall, with ea&s;e, reach town early to|morrow.</P>
<P>Gone to London, &s;aid you, my Lord? This &s;urpri&s;es me! Are you perfectly &s;ure of it? (with &s;ome emotion.)</P>
<P>Perfectly, my dear, and it was on that account, as I ob&s;erved before, I took this road.</P>
<P>Certainly, my Lord, if that is the ca&s;e, I prefer it greatly. I wi&s;h not to &s;ee my father, unle&s;s accompanied by her; I
<PB N="141" REF="140">have not, indeed, courage for it&mdash;Yet, alas! how am I to blame for what has happened?&mdash;Proceed then, my Lord, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, let us get on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; I am mi&s;erable beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, nor &s;hall I know a moment's peace till once more under her protec|tion.</P>
<P>Is this kind, my Emily? (taking her hand) Is your Sommerville, then, &s;o perfectly indifferent to you, that his pre|&s;ence gives you no degree of plea&s;ure? I flattered my&s;elf your tranquillity would have been wholly re&s;tored on finding your&s;elf under that of the mo&s;t tender, the mo&s;t faithful of lovers.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord, do me the ju&s;tice to believe I am deeply &s;en&s;ible of the infi|nite obligations I am under to you. I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful of crea|tures, were I not; but can it &s;urpri&s;e you, that I &s;hould impatiently wi&s;h to relieve my friends from the di&s;tre&s;s this unfortunate affair mu&s;t have involved them in? Surely it ought not; complete then your kind intentions, convey me, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to my Aunt; and de|pend upon it you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to
<PB N="142" REF="141">accu&s;e me of indifference; till then, I can think of nothing but the joy I &s;hall experience in removing all her trouble and anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which you are &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t have been greater than I can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I now ordered the carriage to drive on, and in the mean time did all in my power to calm her perturbation; and, as &s;he had not a doubt of my &s;incerity, by the time we reached the inn, at which we were to re&s;t that night, &s;he was tole|rably compo&s;ed; more &s;o, indeed, Charles, every thing con&s;idered, than I could po&s;&s;ibly have expected.</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, her behaviour &s;urpri&s;ed me a good deal, and I could only account for it, by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf with the idea, that I was unacquainted with the whole adventure, and that by marrying her immediately, all would be &s;et to rights. This conjecture did not &s;erve to rai&s;e her in my e&s;teem; in her &s;ituation, it was certainly natural to form &s;uch a wi&s;h; but it &s;et her delicacy in no very favourable point of view.</P>
<P>I expected to have found her over|whelmed with &s;orry, covered with con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="143" REF="142">&mdash;In &s;hort, I conceived it utterly impo&s;&s;ible, the amiable, the mode&s;t! blu&s;hing Emily! could, after what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o &s;oon regain any degree of tran|quillity; I had figured her to my&s;elf a prey to de&s;pair, and &s;o far from de&s;iring to meet the eyes of her family, that &s;he would rather have wi&s;hed to bury her&s;elf for ever from the &s;ight of any human be|ing, than appear before them.</P>
<P>Such was the notion, Charles, I had fooli&s;hly formed of her &s;entiments; her ideas of virtue:&mdash;it is pretty plain, I had over-rated them, or, as I &s;aid before, &s;he put a con&s;traint upon her&s;elf, in order the better to deceive <HI>me</HI>&mdash;neither the one nor other of the&s;e opinions gave me much &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>Yet, I adore her <HI>per&s;on,</HI> however her <HI>mind</HI> may have &s;uffered in my e&s;teem;&mdash;and I will freely confe&s;s, I &s;hall, with le&s;s &s;cruple, endeavour to gratify my pa&s;&s;ion, though compelled to do it by le&s;s honourable means than I formerly propo&s;ed, after this proof of her artifice and duplicity; no doubt, were <HI>I</HI> in the &s;ame predicament, I &s;hould act as &s;he does&mdash;it is a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> though not a very gene|rous
<PB N="144" REF="143">plan&mdash;but it will not take, Charles&mdash;thank my kind &s;tars, I am a little too far in the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Happy, as I &s;aid before, &s;he &s;hall be, if the intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart and fortune can make her &s;o; but my hand &s;he mu&s;t no longer expect. 'Twould be ridiculous&mdash;every idea of honour, of de|licacy revolts at it. Should the fellow live, what an additional triumph would it be for him; you &s;ee it is ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible to think of it: however blame|le&s;s &s;he may, <HI>&s;trictly</HI> &s;peaking, be; and, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;he will, on &s;erious re|flection, be convinced her wi&s;ie&s;t cour&s;e will be to accept the only terms it is in my power to offer; &s;he <HI>can expect</HI> no other&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould endeavour to gain the &s;ame as before, is, as I &s;aid, natural enough, or at lea&s;t would be &s;o to the ge|nerality of women. But, I own to you, I believed till now, &s;he was &s;uperior to the re&s;t of her &s;ex, and am hurt by find|ing it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet every thing con&s;idered, it is per|haps better as it is; &s;ince being more on a level with them than I had ever imagin|ed, &s;he will with le&s;s reluctance do as as others have done before her.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="144">How to inform her of the change in my &s;entiments I know not; for after all, there is an unde&s;cribable &s;omething in her looks, her manner, in every word &s;he utters, that commands a re&s;pect ab&s;olute|ly incompatible with the propo&s;al I <HI>wi&s;h</HI> nay, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> make, &s;ince my heart tells me &s;he is as dear to me as ever; and that my whole happine&s;s depends upon her &s;miles.</P>
<P>Charles, you can form no idea of her beauty; her numberle&s;s attractions; by heavens! they are irre&s;i&s;tible, and would almo&s;t ju&s;tify any folly a man could com|mit!</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be! I tru&s;t the engag|ing, lovely girl will &s;ee her &s;ituation in a proper light; and grateful for the &s;er|vice I have rendered her, and what I &s;till mean to do, will generou&s;ly reward my attachment. But a truce with reflections. Let me put an end to our journey to London.</P>
<P>We arrived the following day; &s;he was a good deal &s;tartled on my propo&s;ing her going to my hou&s;e; but having a&s;|&s;ured her I knew not in what part of the town her Aunt re&s;ided, though it &s;hould
<PB N="146" REF="145">be my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, was com|pelled to acquie&s;ce, being as ignorant of it as my&s;elf, and having no other friend in this place.</P>
<P>It was too late that evening to begin my &s;earch, of cour&s;e &s;he was obliged to accept an apartment for the night, not without the greate&s;t reluctance; but what el&s;e could &s;he do?</P>
<P>I took care that my behaviour &s;hould be &s;uch as to bani&s;h every apprehen&s;ion, in ca&s;e &s;he had formed any; it was tender and re&s;pectful; I judged it time enough to let her gue&s;s my de&s;ign when I had pretended to make the enquiries &s;he was &s;o anxious about.</P>
<P>How <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;pent the night, I know not; but <HI>I,</HI> Charles, never clo&s;ed my eyes; and was a thou&s;and times tempted to put an end to her &s;u&s;pen&s;e at once&mdash;Can you wonder at it?&mdash;So wholly in my power&mdash;I did not, however, interrupt her re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The next morning I &s;ent up my com|pliments intreating &s;he would indulge me with her company at breakfa&s;t; her an|&s;wer was, &s;he had &s;lept but little, begged I would excu&s;e her, and permit her to
<PB N="147" REF="146">have a cup of tea in the dre&s;&s;ing-room; adding, &s;he hoped I would not a moment delay the bu&s;ine&s;s I knew was &s;o inter|e&s;ting to her.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age &s;he &s;ent by my hou&s;e|keeper, who delivered it very di&s;tinctly; this I readily granted, ordering her to pay the lady every po&s;&s;ible mark of re&s;pect and attention; but in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould a&s;k for writing materials, to take care not let|ters were &s;ent out of the hou&s;e till I had &s;een them.</P>
<P>This encrea&s;ed Wat&s;on's curio&s;ity; which I &s;aw, by her looks, was highly ex|cited on our fir&s;t arrival. I did not, how|ever, think proper to indulge it ju&s;t then, though I believe, Charles, I might have tru&s;ted her, as &s;he knows me pretty well, and has not hitherto pre&s;umed to &s;ee far|ther into the&s;e kind of affairs than I would have her; &s;he is per&s;ectly &s;atisfied with her &s;ituation, and ju&s;tly concludes I have a right to render mine as agreeable, by any means I plea&s;e; I am ma&s;ter, and &s;he has been accu&s;tomed to obey me as &s;uch.</P>
<P>That point &s;ettled, and &s;ome other or|ders given to Frank on the &s;ame &s;ubject,
<PB N="148" REF="147">I &s;allied forth, not with hopes of finding our good Aunt, but my good friend Dal|ton.

<P>I went out accoringly, meaning, as I &s;aid, to call on you to give you this ac|count&mdash;I did &s;o, but to my no &s;mall di&s;|appointment found you had left town the very day before&mdash;I was cur&s;edly vexed, having a thou&s;and things to communi|cate, be&s;ides what I have now mentioned; finding no better might be, I marched up to your &s;tudy, and there wrote this enor|mous packet, which you will get, I &s;up|po&s;e, on Tue&s;day&mdash;&s;o farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. <HI>Lady Stanley to Mrs. Gro&s;vonor.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Stanley Place.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t had a vi&s;it from Mrs, Grenville&mdash;no &s;u&s;picion you &s;ee, Caro|line, of the hand I have had in the plot&mdash;&s;o much the better; &s;ince by this means I &s;hall hear, without trouble, how matters go on.</P>
<P>She is ju&s;t returned from her brother's, where they have had &s;o delightful a &s;quabble on the &s;ubject of their fair he|roine, that &s;he vows &s;he will never enter his doors again while &s;he has life.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert and his rib, blame <HI>her</HI> want of proper care and attention for all that has happened. <HI>She</HI> lays the whole on them for encouraging the pre&s;umptu|ous hopes of a fellow, who has proved, by his villainy, how little he de&s;erved it; for you may well believe they &s;oon heard who the hero was, who had been the au|thor of all this con&s;u&s;ion, but are by no means certain who the per&s;on is to whom
<PB N="151" REF="150">&s;he is indebted for her deliverance; though they &s;u&s;pect Sommerville; find|ing, by the old woman's blabbing, (for &s;he could not keep her own &s;ecret) the footing his Lord&s;hip was upon; nay, <HI>&s;he</HI> brags of it, and &s;ays, but for that au|dacious wretch, Emily would ere now have been in &s;o elevated a &s;tyle as to have looked down on them all with the con|tempt they de&s;erve; nor does &s;he yet de|&s;pair, if their conjectures are well found|ed, &s;ince &s;he knows his Lord&s;hip is a man of honour; were &s;he once convinced her poor child had &s;allen into <HI>his</HI> hands, all her cares would be at an end.</P>
<P>Certainly, there can be no doubt of it, if, as you &s;ay, they were &s;o &s;oon to have been married, (of <HI>this</HI> circum&s;tance, Ca|roline, I pretended ignorance.)&mdash;But what &s;urpri&s;es me is, her not writing to in&s;orm you of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; this is the only thing which, on that &s;urmi&s;e, I cannot clearly account for, unle&s;s by &s;uppo&s;ing they mean to give you an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah, Lady Stanley! it is certainly &s;o; how could I be &s;o &s;tupid as not to think of that before; depend upon it, it is as
<PB N="152" REF="151">your Lady&s;hip gue&s;&s;es; what el&s;e, indeed, could prevent her letting me hear from her. Heavens! what a triumph &s;hall I yet enjoy over her ridiculous family, who have pre&s;umed to treat me with &s;o much indignity; my &s;pirits revive, I am quite delighted with your Lady&s;hip's &s;uperior di&s;cernment; but my ideas have, for &s;ome time, been in &s;uch a &s;tate of confu&s;ion and perplexity, I could think of nothing.</P>
<P>And pray, ma'am, may I a&s;k, what is become of that wretch, Morton? I long to hear the particulars of my lovely friend's deliverance.</P>
<P>Ah! he met not with half the &s;everity he de&s;erves; death would have been too mild a puni&s;hment for his infamous con|duct; he is, however, mo&s;t de&s;perately wounded, and &s;till lies in the utmo&s;t dan|ger: one of his men, immediately after the affair happened, &s;et off to Mr. Her|bert's in order to inform his Aunt of the horrid tran&s;action, not by his vile ma&s;|ter's commands, he owned, for he was in no condition to give any; nor would he, I pre&s;ume, have given <HI>tho&s;e</HI> if he had; &s;ince it is more natural to believe he would have withed the whole odious
<PB N="153" REF="152">&s;tory buried in eternal oblivion, &s;ince he made &s;o de&s;picable a figure in it; but the fellow thought it his duty to do &s;o, what|ever might be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>If we may credit the account he gives, my poor niece met with more re&s;pect during her confinment than &s;he had any rea&s;on to expect from &s;uch a brute; he a&s;&s;ures us, his ma&s;ter, as far as he was able to judge, appeared as much concern|ed for what he had done as &s;he could be, on finding it was all likely to be ineffec|tual, &s;ince &s;he repeatedly a&s;&s;ured him no power on earth &s;hould ever compel her to give him her hand.</P>
<P>She never le&s;t her apartment, except once for an hour at his earne&s;t entreaty, and he &s;aid they concluded it was only then with a view to prevail on him to re|&s;tore her to her friends&mdash;but finding all her eloquence, tears and threats, lo&s;t upon his hardened heart, &s;he left him, nor ever would a &s;econd time admit him to her pre&s;ence; &s;he was then &s;eized with a violent fit of illne&s;s, and how it would have ended (continued the old dowager) had not heaven interpo&s;ed in her favour, it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="153">And pray, ma'am, in what light does he appear to Mr. and Mrs. Herbert? Surely they cannot acquit <HI>him,</HI> while they pre&s;ume to blame <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>O! as for Mr. Herbert, it is long &s;ince he has given up all preten&s;ions to judge for him&s;elf; yet he does condemn him as far as he dare do it&mdash;but <HI>&s;he</HI> vows he act|ed like a man of &s;pirit; the girl was his by the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e; he had re&s;|cued her from tho&s;e who were on the point of robbing him of her for ever, he would have married her&mdash;what then had he done ami&s;s? All &s;he regretted was that he had not been fortunate enough to revenge the intended injury as &s;he mo&s;t fervently wi&s;hed; he was dear to her, and ever &s;hould be if heaven &s;pared his life; but as to the undutiful, the di&s;obe|dient creature, who had been the &s;atal cau&s;e of all this trouble, &s;he hoped Mr. Herbert had too much regard for <HI>her</HI> peace of mind ever to expect &s;he would &s;ee her more, &s;hould he be weak enough to think of &s;uch a thing; &s;he had taken <HI>her</HI> re&s;olution, one hou&s;e &s;hould never contain them both, on this &s;he was fully
<PB N="155" REF="154">determined; her father might do as he thought proper.</P>
<P>This, Caroline, is the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed, during Mrs. Grenville's vi|&s;it; &s;he left me clearly convinced in her own mind that her niece would &s;oon be here, figuring away in all her glory, as Lady Sommerville. Don't you think &s;he &s;tands a chance of being finely mortified by the di&s;appointment of all her high rai&s;ed ambitious hopes; mo&s;t horridly &s;hould I be &s;o, I confe&s;s, could I for a moment believe he could be &s;uch an idiot.</P>
<P>At any rate, indeed, I think he will not make him&s;elf &s;o completely ridicu|lous; nor will <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> I pre&s;ume, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> quite &s;o ea&s;ily forbid her pre&s;ence, as that poor tame fool it &s;eems has been&mdash;No, no, Caroline! Sommerville will not be &s;o &s;oon intimidated, take my word for it.</P>
<P>I die to know how they are going on, but am out of the track of gaining far|ther intelligence; this, in &s;pite of my better judgement, leaves me in &s;ome de|gree of anxiery&mdash;I hate &s;u&s;pence&mdash;yet it is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible he can marry her. Ah! I could not &s;up|port
<PB N="156" REF="155"> that horrid &s;troke after the pains I have taken to prevent it; I think he can|not be quite &s;o lo&s;t to common &s;en&s;e, though, after all, men are the ab&s;urde&s;t of animals, and the wi&s;e&s;t of them at times are the direct contrary.</P>
<P>Would I had never &s;een him! or that I could tear his perfidious image from my brea&s;t! I dete&s;t my&s;elf for be&s;towing a thought upon &s;uch an incon&s;tant; yet he is never one moment out of my head!&mdash;My pre&s;ent <HI>cici&s;heo</HI> does all in his power to &s;upplant him in my affections, and if any man could do it, Man&s;ell would be the man; he is not wholly void of at|tractions, and I believe adores me: but he is not a Sommerville&mdash;however he has no rea&s;on to complain of my cruelty; there is no doing without &s;omebody to trifle with, and he has that talent to per|fection.&mdash;Farewell.</P>

<P>You would, no doubt, wi&s;h to know all the particulars of &s;o extraordinary an event; but &s;pare me the repetition till we meet, that time I tru&s;t is not far di&s;tant; I am no longer in his power, for
<PB N="159" REF="158">which my thanks are due to heaven and the generous Lord Sommerville, who at the hazard of his life has been my de|liverer; yes, Sophia, I repeat, at the hazard of his life, he has re&s;cued me from a &s;tale of ab&s;olute mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Ten tedious days did I pa&s;s in a di&s;|traction of mind no words can de&s;cribe; he did not even attempt to apologize for what he had done, on the contrary he &s;eemed to triumh in the &s;ucce&s;s of his odious &s;cheme, and the di&s;appointment of all my hopes of happine&s;s. Swore I &s;hould now be compelled to give him my hand, which, though he no longer valued, he would accept, believing he &s;hould by that means mortify me more than by any other method he could de|vi&s;e.</P>
<P>Shocked beyond expre&s;&s;ion, as you may well imagine, at &s;uch a declaration, and fearing he would contrive to put his hor|rid threat in execution, I endeavoured to &s;often his re&s;entment, by promi&s;ing to give up Lord Sommerville, and to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible effort to conquer my for|mer reluctance, on condition he would re&s;tore me to my Aunt.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159">In vain were all the promi&s;es I could make; he in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould in&s;tantly marry him either with or without my con|&s;ent; never till I was his wife, &s;hould I have leave to quit that hou&s;e; this he a&s;&s;ured me was a point no power on earth &s;hould make him relinqui&s;h; if, there|fore, I wi&s;hed to revi&s;it my friends, I knew on what terms I could do &s;o; bid me &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on my &s;ituation, as he was not a man to be tri&s;led with; that he had my father's approbation, nor did he &s;ear lo&s;ing it by any &s;tep he had, or might be compelled to take, in order to accomplith his purpo&s;e; that I was his by the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e; as to tho&s;e <HI>I</HI> made, he knew me too well to put any tru&s;t in them.</P>
<P>His cool determined manner terrified me, Sophia, infinitely more than any other could have done. I retired to the apartment allotted me, plunged in the deepe&s;t de&s;pair, and there gave free vent to my unavailing tears.</P>
<P>Next morning I found my&s;elf extreme|ly ill; he &s;ent up to beg he might be permitted to &s;ee me.&mdash;Alas! was it in my power to prevent it by a refu&s;al? He
<PB N="161" REF="160">came, and appeared alarmed at the con|dition in which he found me; I had not undre&s;&s;ed, but had thrown my&s;elf on the bed, where I lay the whole night with|out clo&s;ing my eyes.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon after &s;eized with a fever, which I &s;incerely hoped would have put an end to all my troubles. I believe he now very &s;incerely repented the &s;tep he had taken, fearing the fatal con&s;equences likely to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>I mu&s;st confe&s;s every po&s;&s;ible care was taken of me during my illne&s;s, no doubt as much, or more perhaps for his own &s;ake than mine. I kept my bed for &s;e|veral days, and when able to leave it, he again reque&s;ted admittance.</P>
<P>I now found his behaviour much chang|ed; he, with a tenderne&s;s I did not think him capable of, implored me to con&s;ent, without obliging him to have recour&s;e to compul&s;ive mea&s;ures, which he wi&s;hed to avoid; declared he loved me with unabated pa&s;&s;ion, that it &s;hould be the &s;tudy of his life to make me happy, beg|ged I would forget the pa&s;t, confe&s;&s;ed he had been much to blame, that he had made u&s;e of &s;ome har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, for
<PB N="162" REF="161">which he was now truly concerned, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>My only reply was as before, re&s;tore me to my friends, and depend on my gra|titude, and the promi&s;e I have already made to give up Lord Sommerville.</P>
<P>Whether he would at la&s;t have com|plied with my reque&s;t, Sophia, heaven knows! I am rather inclined to think he would, &s;ince he mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible it would have been no ea&s;y matter to have married me without my con&s;ent, though he had threatened it.</P>
<P>How the matter would have ended, I cannot &s;ay; this however is certain, I would rather have &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t cruel death, than have con&s;ented to be his.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Lord Sommerville was &s;ent by heaven to my relief, he left the wretch de&s;perately wounded and brought me to London; my Aunt being here, it &s;eems, and I chu&s;ing rather to be conveyed to her than my father.</P>
<P>We arrived la&s;t night; I was much &s;hocked on finding my&s;elf under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of remaining till this morning in his Lor&s;hip's hou&s;e; but what could I do? It was too late to enquire for her
<PB N="163" REF="162">then; he is now gone out for that pur|po&s;e, and I, in the mean time, have given you this imperfect account of an affair which has, as you may ea&s;ily believe, de&s;tre&s;&s;ed me beyond conception.</P>
<P>In a few hours, I tru&s;t, all my anxiety will be over; I think I can <HI>now</HI> have nothing to fear from that odious creature, &s;hould he recover, which (be&s;ides the horror and regret I &s;hould ever feel at being the cau&s;e, though an innocent one, of a per&s;on's death) on Lord Sommer|ville's account, I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h, lea&s;t he &s;hould be brought into trouble. My father cannot, after &s;o ba&s;e a conduct, continue to favour his addre&s;&s;es; it is impo&s;&s;ible, Sophia, do not you think &s;o? This con&s;olatory re&s;lection almo&s;t makes me forget what I have &s;uffered. Were I but once more with my dear Aunt, I &s;hould be comparatively happy; and this, I hope, I &s;hall be before night.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear friend; I expect his Lord&s;hip every moment to conduct me to her; I will then write more fully, as my mind will be more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah! what gratitude do I not owe my charming deliverer.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163">
Tran&s;ported, Charles, to find my|&s;elf mentioned by my beloved with &s;uch warmth, &s;uch eloquent tenderne&s;s, I felt a kind of pang at the thoughts of the de|ception I was on the point of putting in practice: I pau&s;ed for a few moments&mdash;Had I fellowed the fir&s;t cictates of my heart, I &s;hould have in&s;tanly led her to the altar, and made her honourably mine by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties;&mdash;every ob&s;tacle was then &s;orgot&mdash;but a little recollection of what had pa&s;&s;ed brought me to my &s;o|ber &s;en&s;es; vet even then, I was &s;tagger|ed&mdash;what was I to think of the account &s;he had given of the adventure? So whol|ly different from that <HI>I</HI> had received of it. Was it po&s;&s;ible &s;he could &s;o calmly talk of happine&s;s, of all her troubles being at an end, if the ra&s;cal had treated her in the manner de&s;cribed in that cur&s;ed let|ter. This puzzled me&mdash;but I con&s;idered the &s;ame motives, which I concluded had made her conceal the horrid truth from <HI>me,</HI> might induce her to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject to her friend.</P>
<P>This idea put an end to all my doubts and &s;cruples at once; my pa&s;&s;ion for the lovely, injured creature continued in full
<PB N="165" REF="164">force; but all thoughts of matrimony fled with them. The only remaining difficul|ty was, how to inform her my &s;earch for her Aunt had been fruitle&s;s, &s;ince her next reque&s;t would of cour&s;e be that I would convey her home, which you may believe I had no thoughts of complying with; in &s;hort it was to be done, the hour in which &s;he expected me was come, what would &s;he think of not &s;eeing me?</P>
<P>While thus deliberating, I heard her bell ring, and pre&s;ently a &s;ervant came to let me know &s;he had enquired whether I was come in.</P>
<P>I now could delay no longer, but bid him return and tell her I was in the draw|ing room&mdash;down &s;he came in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>Well, my Lord, cried the lovely crea|ture, with &s;weet impatience; what &s;ays my Aunt? Have you &s;een her? Will &s;he come &s;or me, or am I to go to her? Per|haps &s;he is now in the hou&s;e&mdash;Oh! tell me, do not keep me in &s;u&s;pence! I beg of you.</P>
<P>Why the&s;e emotions, my adorable Emily? Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my be&s;t love, (taking her hand and leading her to a &s;eat) are you, then, &s;o very impatient to leave the man who lives but in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="165">Ah! my Lord! No tri&s;ling I be&s;eech you, as you value my peace! Where is my Aunt! Why is &s;he not here? She was going to the window, Charles, no doubt in hopes of &s;eeing her carriage at the door.</P>
<P>Why is my angel thus di&s;turbed, (again taking her hand) did I not flatter my&s;elf, &s;he would think her&s;elf perfectly &s;afe under the protection of her adoring Som|merville. I &s;hould fear to tell her all my enquiries this morning have been in vain; but I hope to be more &s;ucce&s;sful another time.</P>
<P>In vain! (with a look of terror) Have you not found her, then, my Lord? Good heavens! What will become of me? How very, very unfortunate! Are you certain &s;he really came to London? I now begin to fear your Lord&s;hip has been mi&s;inform|ed; &s;he had no &s;uch de&s;ign when I left her. I am mi&s;erable beyond expre&s;&s;ion at this cruel di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Why mi&s;erable, my angel? (interrupt|ing her) I may be more &s;ucce&s;sful in my next attempt; are you not with the man who adores you? Who would with joy &s;acrifice his life to give you a moment's plea&s;ure!</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="166">Ah! talk not of plea&s;ure, my Lord! while I am thus at a di&s;tance from my friends. Let me be gone; I will wait no longer. Alas, I have been here too long already. I wi&s;hed to &s;ee my Aunt. I feared to meet the eyes of my father unle&s;s &s;upported by her pre&s;ence; but &s;ince that cannot be, let me &s;et off in&s;tantly, for rather would I encounter his indignation, however &s;evere, than. remain another hour in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion; your Lord&s;hip cannot but &s;ee the impropriety of it, and will, therefore, pardon me if I appear to forget my obli|gations to you&mdash;I do not, believe me, I have a proper &s;en&s;e of them, and ever &s;hall; when my mind is more at ea&s;e than it can be at pre&s;ent, it &s;hall be my &s;tudy to make you &s;en&s;ible of my gratitude.</P>
<P>And can my charming Emily, then talk with &s;o much cool indifference of leaving a man &s;he once pro&s;e&s;&s;ed to honour with her e&s;teem? (attempting to pre&s;s her hand to my lips.)</P>
<P>You a&s;toni&s;h me, my Lord! (ha&s;tily withdrawing it) can <HI>Lord Sommerville</HI> be &s;urpri&s;ed at my impatience? Surely if &s;o, I mu&s;t have been greatly deceived in the opinion I believed he had formed of
<PB N="168" REF="167">me! But let us drop the &s;ubject. Per|mit one of your &s;ervants, my Lord, to get me a carriage; I have not a moment to lo&s;e; and &s;he was going to ring the bell.</P>
<P>At that moment we were informed din|ner was &s;erved.&mdash;Indulge me, my Emily, with one &s;hort hour of your dear com|pany, and then if you will per&s;i&s;t in your cruel intention, you &s;hall be obeyed.</P>
<P>Can you doubt it, my Lord?&mdash;I took her hand to lead her to the dining room.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t let me give directions, and, till the carriage arrives, I will not re&s;u&s;e you my company, though in my pre&s;ent per|plexed &s;tate of mind it can afford but lit|tle plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Frank was waiting; the moment we entered the room <HI>I</HI> bid him order my po&s;t chai&s;e to be got ready as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, at the &s;ame time giving him a look, which he perfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>But why your's, my Lord? pray allow me to&mdash;</P>
<P>Do as you are told, (interrupting her) can Mi&s;s Herbert &s;uppo&s;e I will &s;uffer her to go &s;uch a journey in any other?</P>
<P>She was tolerably ea&s;y, Charles, dur|ing the time we &s;at at table, though fre|quently looking at her watch and li&s;ten|ing
<PB N="169" REF="168">for the &s;ound of the carriage&mdash;above an hour pa&s;&s;ed and no account of it. She then grew impatient, and implored me to enquire why they were &s;o dilatory?</P>
<P>I rung the bell, pretended to be in a rage at their &s;tupidity, and charged them to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; in the mean time &s;aid all that man could &s;ay to re|move her anxiety; but gue&s;s how it was encrea&s;ed on Frank coming to inform me the po&s;tillion was not to be found; he fan|cied he was gone to &s;ee his mother, who he had heard was at the point of death, and who lived at the other end of the town.</P>
<P>I now &s;tormed at his daring to go out of the way without permi&s;&s;ion. My gen|tle Emily begged me to con&s;ider the cau&s;e, and on that account to forgive him, at the &s;ame time intreating him to get her another as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I need hardly tell you, Charles, it was &s;o contrived, that under one pretence or other, the day was &s;o far advanced before, we heard any more of the carriage, that it was too late to think of &s;etting off that night.</P>
<P>It is utterly out of my power to give you an idea of her di&s;tre&s;s at the&s;e re|peated
<PB N="170" REF="169">and unlooked for di&s;appoint|ments: &s;he wept, &s;he wrung her hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ab&s;olute de&s;pair; and, I believe, was not even then wholly void of &s;u&s;picion; yet my behaviour was &s;o guarded, that not a look or word e&s;caped me that could ju&s;tly alarm her.</P>
<P>Alar med &s;he certainly was, however, to the la&s;t degree, and almo&s;t fainting with terror and apprehen&s;ion, when, find|ing &s;he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;taying another night, &s;he begged to retire.</P>
<P>I now rung for Wat&s;on, who conducted her to her apartment, and afterwards told me the young Lady had &s;trictly and po&s;itively de&s;ired to have a chai&s;e at the door by day light next morning, as &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;et out as early as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The morning came, but no carriage;&mdash;the dear creature had taken no re&s;t, her bell was rung repeatedly many hours be|fore day; but I had given directions not to an&s;wer it till the u&s;ual time of break|fa&s;t, and to &s;ecure the &s;treet-door in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould make any attempt to leave the hou&s;e; whether &s;he did or not atttempt it is uncertain.</P>
<P>About ten I went up to her dre&s;&s;ing|room, and, tapping gently, &s;he in&s;tantly
<PB N="171" REF="170">opened the door, no doubt believing it to be Wat&s;on. On &s;eeing me &s;he &s;tarted; her lovely eyes were red, and vi&s;ibly de|clared &s;he had been weeping.</P>
<P>What am I to think, my Lord?&mdash;(with a dignity in her manner, Charles, that actually overawed and di&s;concerted me mo&s;t confoundedly) of the treatment I have received? I would gladly believe the di&s;appointments of ye&s;terday were accidental: but why were my orders di&s;|obeyed this morning? Why, or by who&s;e authority is it I am now detained here, when you know the impropriety of it, and my extreme impatience to be gone?</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed, Charles, ab&s;olutely unable to plea&s;e my&s;elf with any an&s;wer I could give.</P>
<P>Finding I &s;till gazed on her in &s;ilence, and no doubt &s;eeing guilt pictured on my countenance, &s;he continued&mdash;Oh! my Lord! Do not for heaven's &s;ake! Do not give me cau&s;e to change the opinion I have hitherto entertained of you! I have, till now, believed you a man of honour; that my happine&s;s was dear to you; tell me, then, have I been deceived? Speak
<PB N="172" REF="171">at once, my Lord, and relieve me from this dreadful &s;u&s;pence. Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I wi&s;h you may be able to remove tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which this &s;trange, and, let me &s;ay, cruel and incomprehen&s;ible behaviour has given rite to.</P>
<P>Throwing my&s;elf at her feet, I pa&s;&s;ion|ately exclaimed, Oh! my Emily! My adorable Emily! Behold the mo&s;t faith|ful, the mo&s;t tender of lovers, imploring your pardon; yes, my be&s;t beloved, I will confe&s;s I cannot whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ju&s;tify the conduct of which you complain; I mu&s;t own my crime, but &s;urely, <HI>&s;urely,</HI> I have not &s;inned beyond forgivene&s;s! Could I, was it in nature, I could re&s;ign, without di&s;traction, the object on whom my &s;oul doated, and on whom the whole happi|ne&s;s of my life depends. Oh, my charm|ing! my deare&s;t Emily! Did you love, did you adore as I do! how ea&s;ily would you pardon the &s;tep <HI>that</HI> Love has impel|led me to take? What hopes could I be able to indulge of ever &s;eeing you again, had I &s;uffered you to leave me after what has pa&s;&s;ed? Your family, no doubt, are now too much irritated again&s;t me to fa|vour my addre&s;&s;es; nor is this all, have I not cau&s;e to &s;ear the idol of my affec|tions
<PB N="173" REF="172">might have met with a cool recep|tion? Na, &s;everity from tho&s;e who have never, even before this unfortunate event, treated her with that tenderne&s;s &s;he is intitled to, and &s;o ju&s;tly merits.</P>
<P>This is my apology (gazing on her with &s;upplicating looks) Oh! for pity &s;ake, let it find acceptance, treat me not with a&s;|perity, but tell me you forgive, and make me the happie&s;t of men!</P>
<P>It is well, my Lord! Pray ri&s;e, you have cleared up all my doubts, and I thank you for it; henceforth I &s;hall know in what light to look upon tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions of love you may think proper to make, as well as tho&s;e you have hereto|fore offered; you have, as far as you po&s;&s;ibly can, made me mi&s;erable; and, no doubt, find it a plea&s;ant reflection; how I have de&s;erved this treatment I know not, unle&s;s, as a puni&s;hment for my cre|dulity in believing you incapable of &s;uch an atrocious action? I have only one que&s;tion to a&s;k, for I &s;corn any reply to the very elaborate &s;peech you have taken the trouble to make, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould blu&s;h to at|tempt it, though your Lord&s;hip has not blu&s;hed to utter it&mdash;Am I at liberty to quit this hou&s;e? I know it is in your
<PB N="174" REF="173">power to detain me; and you may, by &s;o doing, make me a very wretched, a very unhappy creature, but a guilty one you never can.</P>
<P>I would now have taken her hand, Charles, but &s;he withdrew it with a look of the utmo&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>Is your Sommerville then &s;unk &s;o very low in your e&s;teem, my lovely Emily, that he merits nothing but repul&s;es. Ah! too &s;ure he has been fatally deceived, while believing he once had a place in it? What have I done to de&s;erve this killing re&s;erve! The&s;e cruel &s;u&s;picions? I have loved! Adored you with the mo&s;t tender pa&s;&s;ion that ever warmed the brea&s;t of man! The whole &s;tudy of my life &s;hall be employed to convince my angel of its fervour and &s;incerity; here on my knees, on this dear hand I &s;wear&mdash;</P>
<P>Swear not, my Lord! (interrupting me) re&s;erve tho&s;e vows for &s;ome other, believe me they will be lo&s;t upon me; that you were once dear to me I mu&s;t acknow|ledge; but that time is pa&s;&s;ed, never, <HI>never</HI> to return! I now &s;ee you &s;uch as you really are, before I &s;aw you only &s;uch as my weak &s;imple heart repre&s;ented
<PB N="175" REF="174">you; how flattering was that picture when compared with the original!&mdash;Surely, my Lord, if not wretchedly har|dened in guilt, the horrid contra&s;t mu&s;t &s;hock even your&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I lo&s;e time in the&s;e fruitle&s;s reflec|tions&mdash;if your Lord&s;hip wi&s;hes to regain any part of that confidence you have &s;o ju&s;tly forfeited, &s;uffer me in&s;tantly to &s;et off for my Father's hou&s;e; this is the only favour I have to a&s;k, and the only proof you can give me that you are not &s;o whol|ly lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of honour as I am at this moment compelled to believe.</P>
<P>In this cool, this mortifying &s;tyle, Charles, did the dear creature continue to treat all I could &s;ay, either in excu&s;e for my conduct or to convince her of the warmth of my pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Determined not to comply with her reque&s;t, I took no notice of it; but in the tendere&s;t manner, pre&s;&s;ed her to indulge me with her company at breakfa&s;t; this &s;he pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emptorily refu&s;ed, declaring &s;he would never, on any terms, quit that room till &s;he left it in order to return home.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="175">Thus, Charles, ended our fir&s;t confer|ence; you will, perhaps, tell me, I be|haved like a fool, that having proceeded &s;o far, I ought not to have been quite &s;o pa&s;&s;ive, that a little more courage and le&s;s re&s;pect would &s;ooner have brought mat|ters to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But you know her not, &s;he is not a girl to be dealt with in the common way; &s;he has a dignity, a delicacy, in &s;hort, a &s;omething about her that forbid one's pre&s;uming to take the &s;malle&s;t liberty, certain never to be forgiven.</P>
<P>How the devil Morton managed, I cannot divine! Not by fair means, I'll be &s;worn; or how <HI>&s;he,</HI> con&s;cious as &s;he mu&s;t be by the pa&s;t, that to be thus in a fel|low's power is no joke, dare treat me with &s;o high a hand, I know as little.</P>
<P>I expected nothing but weeping and wailing; to have &s;een her at my feet im|ploring mercy; for a &s;cene of that nature I was prepared, but her behaviour has totally di&s;concerted my plan of opera|tions; &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, &s;o much calm argument, and &s;o void of apprehen|&s;ion&mdash;Cur&s;edly provoking, Charles! Is it not? Faith I now begin to fancy &s;he ne|ver
<PB N="177" REF="176">cared a &s;traw for me! If &s;he had, &s;he could not behave in this unaccountable manner. No, it is as plain as the day, &s;he neither loves nor fears me; but, by heavens! &s;he &s;hall do one or the other&mdash;I will be revenged for this proof of her duplicity! I have &s;o long been accu&s;|tomed to treat her as a divinity, that I know not how to lower her con&s;equence, and rank her as a mere mortal. But my pride is now concerned; it is piqued at her coldne&s;s; &s;he &s;hall find I will no longer be &s;uch an egregious puppy as to be &s;o ea&s;ily intimidated! I have gone too far to recede, and at my next vi&s;it, &s;hall more explicitly inform her of my pre&s;ent intentions, which, if &s;he is wi&s;e, &s;he will not reject.</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul, every thing con&s;ider|ed, &s;he might li&s;ten to my vows with le&s;s contempt! She cannot &s;eriou&s;ly, after what has happened, expect a renewal of my former propo&s;als, though &s;crictly &s;peaking &s;he is &s;till virtuous; I would do her all po&s;&s;ible ju&s;tice; I believe her mind pure and un&s;ullied; but &s;till, I &s;ay, Charles, &s;he &s;hould con&s;ider her &s;ituation is widely different from what it was before that cur&s;ed event; yet &s;he

<P>I &s;hall, for a day or two, content my|&s;elf with enquiring after her health, as I I would give her time to make proper reflections, and if &s;he does &s;o, Charles, &s;he &s;hall have no rea&s;on to complain; &s;he &s;hall find me all her heart can de&s;ire, the whole &s;tudy of my life &s;hall be to render her happy.</P>

<P>I TOLD you in my la&s;t, Charles, I had determined to give my beloved a few days lei&s;ure, to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on her &s;ituation, flattering my&s;elf the re&s;ult would be favourable to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>At our next meeting, I had every rea|&s;on to believe I had acted wi&s;ely; but you will find before you come to the end of this epi&s;tle, &s;he is as artful as the re&s;t of her bewitching &s;ex.</P>
<P>Having, with infinite difficulty, re|&s;i&s;ted the temptation of &s;eeing her for two tedious days, on the third morning I &s;ent a note by Wat&s;on, intreating &s;he would permit me the honour to wait upon her, adding, my vi&s;it &s;hould be no longer than was perfectly agreeable to her. My reque&s;t was granted.</P>
<P>I found her in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;he had been writing, and had ju&s;t laid by
<PB N="180" REF="179">her letter when I entered, to whom I did not <HI>then</HI> know; but the &s;ubject had af|fected her reatly, for the enchanting girl was &s;till in tears&mdash;&s;he endeavoured to check them, and to re&s;ume her former ea&s;e and indifference; but it would not do, &s;he threw her&s;elf back in her chair and wept aloud.</P>
<P>I was &s;oftened beyond expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;My angel Emily, cried I, throwing my&s;elf at her feet, and pre&s;&s;ing her now unreluct|ant hand to my throbbing brea&s;t, why the&s;e tears? Why this di&s;tre&s;s? Look up my be&s;t beloved; turn tho&s;e dear eyes on your adoring Sommerville; &s;ay but you forgive him; that he has not wholly lo&s;t that place in your e&s;teem, you once gave him leave to hope he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and make him &s;upremely ble&s;&s;ed:&mdash;his heart, his fortune, all, all are your's, and every moment of his future life &s;hall be entirely deveted to his Emily.</P>
<P>What can I &s;ay, my Lord? (with a &s;oftne&s;s, a &s;weetne&s;s in her voice and manner that melted my very &s;oul) You have &s;ucceeded but too well in your de|&s;igns; you have for ever ruined the peace of a young creature, who certainly never
<PB N="181" REF="180">injured you; but who, on the contrary, beheld you with too much partiality. Oh, my Lord! could I have believed the amiable, the generous Sommerville, for &s;uch, till fatally undeceived, I fondly believed you; who, I &s;ay, could have &s;u&s;pected him capable of &s;uch barbarity? Alas! <HI>I,</HI> at lea&s;t, was far, far indeed, from thinking it in his nature!</P>
<P>Ah! wound not my &s;oul with the&s;e unkind reproaches, my amiable creature; I cannot bear them from tho&s;e dear, tho&s;e lovely lips, (interrupting her, and tran&s;|ported to find her thus &s;oftened) forget the pa&s;t. Deign but to ble&s;s your peni|tent Sommerville with one &s;mile in token for forgivene&s;s, and look forward to many years of exqui&s;ite, uninterrupted happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord! what reliance can I place on the man who has already &s;o cru|elly deceived me? Or how look forward to happine&s;s when all my hopes of it are thus de&s;troyed for ever?</P>
<P>Is it nothing then, my Emily, (ten|derly pre&s;&s;ing her dear &s;oft hand to my heart) to be adored, to be loved as never woman was loved before, by the mo&s;t
<PB N="182" REF="181">fathful, the mo&s;t con&s;tant of men, by that once happy, becau&s;e once favoured Sommerville; my Emily is all the world to me, I a&s;k no greater ble&s;&s;ing; I can|not figure to my&s;elf a more exqui&s;ite fe|licity than a return of that pa&s;&s;ion which can end only with my exi&s;tence; give me but permi&s;&s;ion to hope that you will endeavour to forget any part of my con|duct that has incurred your di&s;plea&s;ure, and I will patiently wait your time, you &s;hall never again have cau&s;e to reproach me; every thought, every &s;entiment of my impa&s;&s;ioned heart &s;hall be laid open before you; you &s;hall be my guide, my monitre&s;s&mdash;I here &s;olemnly &s;wear to be wholly directed by my be&s;t beloved in every future action of my life; form me, make me &s;uch as you would have me, only promi&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>I will promi&s;e nothing, endeavouring to remove farther from me on my at|tempting to throw my arm round her de|licate wai&s;t, as &s;he &s;at by me on the &s;o|pha; (it was not in nature to re&s;i&s;t it, Charles;) however as I &s;aw my angel was alarmed, I made &s;hift to command my|&s;elf, fully per&s;uaded that a &s;hort time
<PB N="183" REF="182">would remove tho&s;e delicate, tho&s;e en|gaging &s;cruples, and make her wholly mine.</P>
<P>I will promi&s;e nothing, my Lord, nor ought you yet to expect it; let your future conduct de&s;erve my approbation, and tru&s;t to my gratitude; leave me now, I have been too much agitated for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my &s;pirits, and wi&s;h to be alone.</P>
<P>Shall I venture to a&s;k my Emily's dear company at dinner? (quite tran&s;ported with her conde&s;cending goodne&s;s.)</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, my Lord, I will promi&s;e nothing; if I find my&s;elf able, I will not refu&s;e; in the mean time allow me to compo&s;e my&s;elf; I am far from well, I have &s;uffered much, and my mind is extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I now, unable to command my emo|tions, cla&s;ped the lovely creature to my beating heart, and having printed a thou|&s;and ki&s;&s;es on the fofte&s;t, white&s;t hand that ever nature formed, thanked her for the delightful hope &s;he had given me, and withdrew</P>
<P>From that hour, till the moment I ex|pected to be again ble&s;&s;ed with her pre|&s;ence,
<PB N="184" REF="183">I &s;at lo&s;t in a thou&s;and tran&s;port|ing reflections, all my fears were ba|ni&s;hed, and I gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t unbounded joy. Can you, Charles, won|der at my ec&s;tacie, &s;weetly engaging as &s;he had been during our enchanting in|terview?</P>
<P>The dear girl did not di&s;appoint me, &s;he came down, and &s;till continued the &s;ame amiable creature; yet &s;o much blu&s;hing mode&s;ty; &s;o perfect a propri|ety in every word and look, that for my &s;oul I dur&s;t not take advantage of her re|turning partiality.</P>
<P>She left me early&mdash;and le&s;t me full of the mo&s;t flattering hopes, that my love would be &s;oon returned, which was now become more ardent, more firmly rooted than ever.</P>
<P>I &s;aw her no more that day, as &s;he de|clined meeting me in the evening, and I would not be too importunate, but rea|dily admitted her apology.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was going out, Wat&s;on brought me a &s;econd letter, which &s;he &s;aid Mi&s;s Herbert had prevailed upon her to &s;end to the po&s;t-office, but finding my honour was &s;till at home, thought I might <HI>chu&s;e</HI> to take that trouble my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="184">A pretty turn that, Charles, was it not? I eagerly took it, &s;aying &s;he did perfectly right!&mdash;and returning to my apartment broke the &s;eal, and had the <HI>felicity</HI> to find the contents as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mrs. Grenville.</HEAD>
<P>HAD I not received a thou&s;and proofs of my deare&s;t Aunt's tender friend&s;hip and affection, I &s;hould &s;carcely have cou|rage to addre&s;s her, after having been the fatal, though heaven knows! the in|voluntary cau&s;e of &s;o much mi&s;ery and trouble to her, and my other friends; but tru&s;ting &s;he is too generous to blame me for what it was not in my power to prevent, I with le&s;s apprehen&s;ion take up my pen.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear madam, I have been cruelly deceived! Deceived too by the man I believed incapable of &s;uch ba&s;e|ne&s;s, the man even you looked upon as the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t worthy of his &s;ex; how will you be &s;hocked when I add this man is Lord Sommerville. Great as I believed my obligations were to him for re&s;cuing me from the no le&s;s
<PB N="186" REF="185">dete&s;table Morton, they are now cancel|led by his pre&s;ent behaviour.</P>
<P>Uncertain whether the&s;e &s;ad lines, blot|ted by my ince&s;&s;ant tears, will ever be permitted to reach your dear hand, (though one of the creatures he has placed about me has promi&s;ed to convey them to the po&s;t) I will not wa&s;te my time in giving you all the horrid particu|lars of his perfidy; they &s;hall be re&s;erv|ed till we meet, &s;hould that wi&s;hed-for hour ever arrive; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, when he had nobly, generou&s;ly, as I then ima|gined, delivered me from the power of that wretch, he brought me to London, a&s;&s;uring me, you, my dear madam, were there. This greatly &s;urpri&s;ed me, as I knew not you had any &s;uch intention; but could I doubt the veracity, the ho|nour of a man with whom I was a &s;hort time before to have been united by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties?&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;and Alas! if I had, what would my doubts have availed?&mdash;He had deliberately formed his cruel plan, every circum&s;tance too plain|ly proves it; I have &s;ince remarked it was not the &s;udden thought, but evident|ly preconcerted and deeply laid.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="186">My fir&s;t reque&s;t, on our arrival, was, that he &s;hould in&s;tantly oblige me, by making enquiries, where I could find you. He appeared no le&s;s anxious for it than my&s;elf, and &s;at off that moment; but to my inexpre&s;&s;ble terror, confu&s;ion, and di&s;appointment, returned without &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Judge what mu&s;t have been my feel|ings on finding my&s;elf under the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity of remaining all night in his hou&s;e; but think how infinitely more I am now di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, convinced he has ba&s;e|ly betrayed me.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear madam! for heaven's &s;ake! compa&s;&s;ionate a wretched creature, who&s;e only hope re&s;ts on you! To my (no doubt) enraged father, I dare not pre&s;ume to apply; I &s;ink under the apprehen&s;ion of his too ju&s;t indignation. But you! you were ever my kind, my indulgent friend, ha&s;ten then, on my knees I entreat you, and &s;ave me from de&s;truction!</P>
<P>Hitherto I have had nothing to reproach him with but his cruelty in detaining me. Alas! I am compelled to di&s;&s;emble&mdash;his odious views are but too clear; he no lon|ger thinks me worthy of his hand, yet
<PB N="188" REF="187">profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate of lo|vers! He knows but little of your unfor|tunate Emily, if he pre&s;umes to hope &s;he would now conde&s;cend to be his, even on tho&s;e honourable terms he &s;ormerly pro|po&s;ed&mdash;No! believe me, the man who has dared to in&s;ult and treat me in the man|ner he has done, who has for a moment &s;u&s;pected me &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of ho|nour and of virtue as to comply with his pre&s;ent infamous de&s;igns, mu&s;t, while I have life, be to me the mo&s;t dete&s;table of mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>I fear being interrupted&mdash;Alas! I have ten thou&s;and fears!&mdash;Ha&s;ten then, my dear Aunt, I once more implore you, to my relief: Should heaven &s;o far pity my wretched fate as to &s;uffer this melancholy epi&s;tle to reach my only friend; <HI>ha&s;ten,</HI> and, by your loved pre&s;ence, put an end to the un&s;peakable affictions of your af|fectionate and obedient niece,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>What &s;ay you to this, Charles; is &s;he not a dear, perver&s;e, bewitching, little hypocrite? Can you, after this proof of
<PB N="189" REF="188"><HI>her</HI> artifice, blame me for u&s;ing a little in return?</P>
<P>So, while &s;he has life, I am to be look|ed upon as the mo&s;t dete&s;table of mon|&s;ters! It is devili&s;hly &s;evere faith! But what &s;ay you to her ea&s;y manner of &s;kim|ming over the adventure &s;he met with from the <HI>other mon&s;ter?</HI> Not a word of that e&s;capes her! Ah! let women alone! It is &s;aid they cannot keep even their own &s;ecrets, but I &s;hall henceforth beg leave to deny the fact.</P>
<P>Here have I read two of the &s;weet crea|ture's letters, wrote to two of her deare&s;t friends; but not one &s;yllable has tran&s;pir|ed in either of them relative to the ill u&s;age &s;he has received. Upon my &s;oul I cannot, will not pardon this duplicity; by her deceitful proceeding, &s;he &s;ets me the example; and, by heavens! I will profit by it.</P>
<P>I too will di&s;&s;emble; for mine &s;he &s;hall be&mdash;on that (as I &s;aid be&s;ore) I am deter|mined; but if po&s;&s;ible, it &s;hall be with her own con&s;ent. I love! I adore her! more than ever man adored! It is there|fore I wi&s;h to reconcile her to her fate.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="189">That &s;he did love me, even this imper|tinent letter te&s;tifies; I will rekindle that love, or peri&s;h in the attempt&mdash;yes &s;he &s;hall confe&s;s I am &s;till dear to her&mdash;that I am not the mon&s;ter &s;he at pre&s;ent affects to think me.</P>
<P>Had <HI>I</HI> &s;till talked of matrimony <HI>&s;he</HI> would have treated me with le&s;s &s;everity; nay, even now, I'll be &s;worn would joy|fully li&s;ten to me on that &s;ubject, though &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay otherwi&s;e; it is a conviction that I have no &s;uch intention, which has given birth to this outrageous virtue, delicacy, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>She declares her Aunt is her <HI>only</HI> friend; and I believe, except my&s;elf, &s;he has not another: what her father might be, were he at liberty to follow his own inclina|tion, I know not; but his better half ill talke care of that, my life for it &s;he will not &s;uffer his indignation to evaporate; it is in the cau&s;e of her hopeful nephew, who it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed has been rather roughly handled, though he has a con&s;o|lation to boa&s;t of, &s;uch as it is, which, to me, I own would afford but little. The pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be mutual, or it has no joys
<PB N="191" REF="190">for your friend Sommerville, a <HI>mon&s;ter</HI> though he be.</P>
<P>Now, Charles, if I can contrive to per|&s;uade the dear girl, this only remaining friend is a friend no longer, I tru&s;t &s;he will have &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee her wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e will be to lay a&s;ide her pre&s;ent haughty re&s;entful &s;entiments, to accept my offers with a good grace, and thus confer happine&s;s both on her&s;elf and her adorer. This is my &s;cheme; it is &s;imple and ea&s;y, as thus: She &s;hall believe her letter di&s;patched; in due time comes a &s;hort, categorical an|&s;wer; not indeed wrote by the <HI>dear hand</HI> of her Aunt&mdash;too much inraged for that&mdash;but by tho&s;e of her. Aunt's abigail. Do you comprehend me? In the mean time I continue all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, attention, and re&s;pect; this re&s;tores me gradually to my charmer's good opinion, and prepares her mind to make the be&s;t of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation on finding &s;he has no other re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort &s;ketch of my plan, which I think can hardly fail of &s;ucce&s;s, when you reflect that her heart was once
<PB N="192" REF="191">mine; nay, &s;till is, I fondly hope, and am willing to believe.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Charles, I am now go|ing to write the important &s;erawl, on which I place my greate&s;t dependence.</P>

<P>It is over, Charles&mdash;my lovely weep|ing Emily is now convinced &s;he has no friend on earth to whom &s;he can apply for protection; of cour&s;e I have only to wait patiently till the fir&s;t tumult of her &s;orrows &s;ub&s;ide; and then, I tru&s;t, rea&s;on will convince her &s;he cannot do better than re&s;ign all thoughts of a&s;king it of any other than her devoted Sommerville.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="192">I contrived to get the letter &s;ent by the po&s;t, &s;he received it from Wat&s;on with joyful emotions, and having no doubt of her fidelity, ha&s;tily broke the &s;eal before &s;he left the room; and happy was it &s;he did, for no &s;ooner had &s;he ca&s;t her lovely eyes over the fir&s;t lines, which were abun|dantly expre&s;&s;ive, than cla&s;ping her hand in an agony of grief, and faintly exclaim|ing, then I am lo&s;t indeed! She fell life|le&s;s on the chair where &s;he &s;at.</P>
<P>Wat&s;on, terrified at her fainting, flew to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport her, having fir&s;t rung the bell with great violence.</P>
<P>Gue&s;&s;ing what had happened, I ran up &s;tairs, and &s;ound my angel in this condi|tion, the letter lying by her on the floor; I in&s;tantly rai&s;ed her in my arms, and conveyed her to her bed, where kneeling by her, I tried by every endearing and tender expre&s;&s;ion, to recall her to life: the&s;e, and &s;ome drops which Wat&s;on ad|mini&s;tered, at length, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;tored her to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I now ordered the &s;ervants to leave the room, and pre&s;&s;ing her almo&s;t li&s;ele&s;s hands in mine, begged her to tell me what had occa&s;ioned &s;o &s;udden an indi&s;po&s;ition?
<PB N="194" REF="193">She no &s;ooner ob&s;erved me, than &s;he look|ed terrified; crying, Leave me! Leave me, my Lord! nor cruelly attempt to re|call to life a wretched creature who can never again know peace: then, bur&s;ting into a flood of tears, &s;he, in the mo&s;t pa|thetic, heart-melting expre&s;&s;ions, bewail|ed her mi&s;erable fate.</P>
<P>My love, my deare&s;t Emily, tell me, I conjure you tell me, what has happened thus to di&s;tre&s;s you? Am I not your friend? Your adoring lover? Can you doubt my zeal and readine&s;s to &s;erve and oblige you? Or even to &s;acrifice my life was it po&s;&s;ible I could thereby re&s;tore my angel to peace and happine&s;s? Speak to me; command me; here, on my knees, I &s;wear by all that's &s;acred to refu&s;e you nothing you can a&s;k! Are you not dearer to me than my own &s;oul?</P>
<P>On my Lord! my Lord! attempt no longer to deceive me, too well do I know what confidence to place in your vows and prote&s;tations. Perhaps when death has relea&s;ed me from this treacherous, this wicked world, a moment may come in which you will reflect with angui&s;h on
<PB N="195" REF="194">your conduct to one who once was weak enough to believe you faultle&s;s.</P>
<P>Heaven has &s;everely! Ah! how very &s;everely puni&s;hed my too ea&s;y credulity! At pre&s;ent your Lord&s;hip may perhaps triumph in your &s;ucce&s;s; you have, in|deed, &s;ucceeded but too well! You have undone me!&mdash;ruined! for ever ruined a poor young creature, who de&s;erved a bet|ter fate! But I forgive you! May heaven al&s;o be merciful! and forgive you too, and &s;oon take me from this &s;cene of inex|pre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery! For&s;aken! Given up by all my friends! Become a wretched outca&s;t! What have I now to hope?</P>
<P>Every thing, my be&s;t beloved! Every thing in the power of the man who adores you! who&s;e whole &s;tudy it &s;hall be from this moment to &s;upply to you the lo&s;s of tho&s;e unkind friends you lament; they were not worthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o ine&s;timable a trea&s;ure, they knew not the value of the jewel they thus reject; but your de|voted Sommerville knows it well, and will pre&s;erve it as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing heaven can be&s;tow on him.</P>
<P>Look up then, my be&s;t love, turn tho&s;e dear eyes upon him; tru&s;t him, place a
<PB N="196" REF="195">proper confidence in him, and you &s;hall be happy, <HI>happy</HI> as it is in the power of the mo&s;t faithful, the mo&s;t tender of lo|vers to make you.</P>
<P>Let me in&s;tantly quit this hou&s;e then, my Lord? This, and <HI>this</HI> only, I a&s;k as a proof of your &s;incerity.</P>
<P>By heavens you &s;hall, my Emily! Even this cruel reque&s;t I will comply with, though I thereby deprive my&s;elf of every po&s;&s;ible hope of felicity! Yes, I will give you this painful proof of my &s;incerity; but fir&s;t let me &s;ee you re&s;tor|ed to tranquillity; you are not at pre&s;ent, my angel, in a condition to think of re|moving; &s;urely my behaviour has been &s;uch as might bani&s;h every idea of fear, or &s;u&s;picion; depend upon its continu|ance, depend upon my honour. Never, my lovely Emily, &s;hall it be &s;uch as to incur your di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I love, I adore you, it is true, with a pa&s;&s;ion more ardent than words can ex|pre&s;s, on a return of which, my whole happine&s;s is centered; but it mu&s;t be vo|luntary, never will your Sommerville for|get that re&s;pect you &s;o ju&s;tly merit; he will leave to time, and his unremitted
<PB N="197" REF="196">endeavours to convince you of his ten|derne&s;s and affection, to produce that wi&s;hed-for change in your &s;entiments, which can alone con&s;titute his felicity.</P>
<P>In the interim he is, and ever will be your unchangeable friend; as &s;uch look upon, as &s;uch command him&mdash;but do not be too precipitate, my deare&s;t creature, reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on what you would wi&s;h to do, whether return to your Father&mdash;your Aunt&mdash;or. &hellip;</P>
<P>Oh, my Lord! (again bur&s;ling into tears) Why! Ah, why all tho&s;e obliging profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip now? When well you know they come too late for my peace! My Father!&mdash;My Aunt!&mdash;Alas! Alas! I have no longer!&mdash;</P>
<P>She could not proceed, her angui&s;n put it out of her power to fini&s;h the &s;entence. Upon my &s;oul, Charles, her di&s;tre&s;s &s;of|tened me even to tears; the drops &s;ell on her lovely hand.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord, is it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould yet remain any degree of tenderne&s;s, of compa&s;&s;ion, in a heart that ha hitherto been &s;o callous, &s;o capable of acting as you have done? Even you weep, my Lord, who have been the voluntary au|thor of all my &s;orrows, think then, can <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="197">ever hope that my tears will cea&s;e to flow? But let me &s;eize the favourable mo|ment to renew my &s;uit: am I at liberty to leave you? No matter where! or to whom I go! Heaven, I tru&s;t, will not wholly abandon me; on that I rely&mdash;I have been a weak but not a guilty crea|ture, my Lord, and doubt not providence will guide my &s;teps to &s;ome more ho&s;pi|table door than tho&s;e which are now for ever &s;hut again&s;t me! And again &s;he &s;ob|bed as if her heart would break.</P>
<P>By heavens! Charles, it was too much! I could hardly &s;upport her ten|der, gentle complaints; no reproaches! No violent exclamations! But all angelic &s;oftne&s;s! I was temped to pronounce my&s;elf a villain; to repent, and to make a full confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;I did not, yet, how|ever, &s;till hoping time would be my friend.</P>
<P>I left her rather more compo&s;ed, (con|fiding in the promi&s;e I had given her) that &s;he might con&s;ider what &s;tep &s;he was to take, &s;aying I would wait on her again when &s;he did me the honour to let me know &s;he had come to a re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I waited &s;everal hours, but no &s;um|mons coming, my patience was at length
<PB N="199" REF="198">exhau&s;ted, and I went up to her apart|ment.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my Emily, I come to make a propo&s;al, which I flatter my&s;elf will meet your approbation.</P>
<P>Though it is wor&s;e than death to part from the deare&s;t trea&s;ure I have on earth, to be &s;pearated from the loved object of my tendere&s;t affections; I will not break my word, I have promi&s;ed and will per|form; hear me, my angel, and then judge how far it will be agreeable to you.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, I pre&s;ume, from &s;ome words that dropped from tho&s;e dear lips, you would not wi&s;h to return either to your Father or Aunt.</P>
<P>She &s;ighed deeply, and rai&s;ed her fine eyes to heaven in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then, my deare&s;t creature &s;hould, till their di&s;plea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ides, go to a hou&s;e of mine in the country.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Of yours, my Lord!</HI> (exclaimed &s;he.)</P>
<P>Here me patiently, my Emily; it is mine, but I never re&s;ide there, nor will I pre&s;ume to attempt &s;eeing you without your permi&s;&s;ion, of this I give you my honour; the pre&s;ent inhabitants are only the &s;teward and his wife, worthy hone&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="199">people&mdash;I will not even offer to accom|pany you; Wat&s;on &s;hall conduct you to them, and if you will permit her, remain there to attend you; &s;he is now no &s;tran|ger to you, and I tru&s;t you have found her behaviour unexceptionable.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation is retired, but a mo&s;t de|&s;irable &s;ummer re&s;idence; there you will be at liberty to write to your friends, to make your peace with them, which I cannot believe will be attended with any difficulty, and every &s;cruple rai&s;ed by my beloved's ideas of delicacy mu&s;t vani&s;h, as no one need know the hou&s;e <HI>is</HI> mine.</P>
<P>Some where you mu&s;t be, and certain|ly the country is more eligible, on every account, than being in town, where you are &s;o intirely a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give proper orders that you &s;hall find every thing as convenient as po&s;&s;ible, and be treated with that re&s;pect, which indeed no one can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;u&s;e to &s;o much excellence; my carriage, or any other if more agreeable, tho' I could wi&s;h you would not &s;o far morti&s;y me as to reject that, &s;hall wait your commands.</P>
<P>Yet I hope you will not leave me till to-morrow; one &s;hort day my Emily may
<PB N="201" REF="200">&s;urely indulge me in; what &s;ays my an|gel? Have I been &s;o happy as to propo&s;e a plan that does not di&s;plea&s;e her?</P>
<P>Alas! my Lord, I would gladly believe you really <HI>now</HI> are de&s;irous of repairing, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the cruel injury you have done me! I can have but one objec|tion&mdash;it is &s;till being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, under your Lord&s;hip's protection! How is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile this with my ideas of propriety?</P>
<P>(She then pau&s;ed for a moment,) Yet what better can I do, &s;ituated as I un|happily am; to &s;tay longer here would be infinitely wor&s;e! it is a &s;ad alterna|tive, my Lord! but I think you mu&s;t be &s;incere, and &s;hall therefore only &s;tipulate, that you will not attempt to &s;ee me while I am at your hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;olemnly, my love, do I &s;wear it, unle&s;s by your permi&s;&s;ion, (and in this I was &s;incere, not doubting but that permi&s;&s;ion would in due time be granted.)</P>
<P>Before I left her every thing was final|ly &s;ettled; I prevailed on her to remain that day and the next, that I might have time to write to Brown and his wife, in
<PB N="202" REF="201">order that every thing might be ready for her reception.</P>
<P>To-morrow! Ah, Charles! to-morrow then my charmer bids me adieu! Wat|&s;on accompanies her, and is to remain as long as &s;he is found nece&s;&s;ary; by this means I &s;hall learn how things go on; I did not demand the liberty of writing to her le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have refu&s;ed me. Now I can do as I plea&s;e, and &s;hall not fail to indulge my&s;elf in that &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>My heart tells me, all will yet be well; &s;he cannot but approve my whole con|duct, one in&s;tance of it excepted, and that I tru&s;t will be forgiven.</P>
<P>What an enviable fate will mine then be, and how amply &s;hall I be rewarded for all the &s;elf-denial I have practi&s;ed while I had the lovely creature thus in my power? Can there be a greater proof, Charles, of the fervour and purity of my pa&s;&s;ion? Perhaps <HI>you</HI> may look upon it in a different light, but you are deceived, a heart like my Emily's is worth waiting for, and her per&s;on without it, all beau|tiful and de&s;irable as it is, would not &s;atisfy me.</P>
<P>To-morrow!&mdash;Ah, would that painful trial was over! To-morrow my adorable
<PB N="203" REF="202">leaves me! But I mu&s;t hope, and think there is a reward in &s;tore for this heroic deed.&mdash;Farewell, my dear Dalton, I am ever your's,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII, <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OFFER your thanks to heaven! with mine, my dear Sophia, for the hap|py pre&s;ervation of your friend, in the great danger I have expo&s;ed to: that I have e&s;caped from a &s;tate of un|&s;peakable mi&s;ery, and from the power of a man who&s;e artful conduct I had every rea&s;on to fear, would, in the end, have wrought my undoing, in &s;pite of all my caution.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear! What terrors have I not &s;uffered? It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you the pains that have been taken to &s;educe
<PB N="204" REF="203">me from the paths of virtue, by the mo&s;t artful! the mo&s;t dangerous of men! <HI>Dangerous,</HI> becau&s;e but too amiable! once I thought him more &s;o than any of his perfidious &s;ex&mdash;but now my prayer is, that I may never behold him more.</P>
<P>Yes, Sophia, I now &s;ee him as he is; and happy, thrice happy do I think my|&s;elf in making the di&s;covery of his ba&s;e|ne&s;s before it was too late.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;ome rea&s;on to fear, the few lines I wrote to you on my deliverance from that wretch, Morton, never reached you, as I think you would not have failed to oblige me with an an&s;wer. If &s;o, you are yet, 'tis probable, ignorant of many things, which, to repeat, would only di&s;tre&s;s us both. Spare me, then, my dear friend, let me pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence, and merely tell you, by what fortunate event I now write from a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>Sommerville!&mdash;Yes, Sophia, the ele|gent, the accompli&s;hed Sommerville! For in &s;pite of the wretchedne&s;s he has &s;o cruelly brought upon me, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay he merits tho&s;e epithets. But alas! How are tho&s;e en|gaging
<PB N="205" REF="204">perfections ob&s;cured and tarni&s;hed by ten thou&s;and vices?</P>
<P>Deceived by Sommerville, I &s;ay, into a belief that my Aunt was in Lon|don, I con&s;ented to let him convey me to her there.&mdash;But had I not agreed to this plan, I am now fatally convinced I could not have avoided the &s;nare he had laid for me. I &s;oon di&s;covered his un|generous, his infamous views; though he took all imaginable pains to alarm me as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>His behaviour, during the tedious days I was compelled to &s;pend in his hou&s;e, was perfectly re&s;pectful; his care, his attention, and unremitted endeavours to oblige, and reconcile me to my fate, great beyond expre&s;&s;ion! I &s;aw plainly he had not a doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, and had nothing, therefore, to fear from vio|lence.</P>
<P>Shocking as it was, to be thus cruelly detained from my friends, it was yet a con&s;iderable con&s;olation, his hou&s;ekeeper had orders to provide me in tho&s;e nece&s;|&s;aries I &s;tood in need of; this &s;he obeyed, and I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of making u&s;e of them, having been torn from the
<PB N="206" REF="205">protection of my Aunt, with no other cloaths than tho&s;e I had on.&mdash;I need hardly add, many more were provided, and tho&s;e too, in more profu&s;ion, and of a more co&s;tly nature than I had either in|clination or occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>Ah! how little was he acquainted with the &s;entiments of your Emily! If he could, for a moment, believe, trifles of that kind could aid his vile purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>Determined by &s;ome means or other to make my e&s;cape, I judged it prudent to di&s;&s;emble, as this would make him le&s;s on his guard.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t, however, wi&s;hed to inform my Aunt of my &s;ituation; no difficulty had been made when I begged they would put the letter I wrote to you in the po&s;t; at lea&s;t I prevailed. Though now I fear, as I &s;aid, it never reached you. Alas, Sophia! that to my Aunt was more for|tunate. But how was I &s;hocked? How were all my hopes cru&s;hed, when I re|ceived her cruel, her dreadfully cruel an&s;wer?</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely ca&s;t my eyes over its heart-rending contents, than, unable to &s;upport the blow, I fainted.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="206">How long I continued in a happy in|&s;en&s;ibility I know not; but when I re|covered from that enviable &s;tate, I found the author of all my &s;orrows kneeling by my bed-&s;ide, to which they had con|veyed me, diftracted by his apprehen|&s;ions.</P>
<P>He had, no doubt, read the fatal let|ter, and I am per&s;uaded plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the thought, that I had not now a friend on earth to whom I could fly for protection; for &s;o my once kind Aunt a&s;&s;ured me in the mo&s;t &s;evere terms&mdash;yet he appeared &s;incerely affected at the con|dition in which he &s;aw me, and in the tendere&s;t, mo&s;t affectionate manner, pro|te&s;ted there was nothing in his power he would not do to re&s;tore my tranquillity; begged me to command him; declared my happine&s;s was infinitely dearer to him than his own; that every word, every action of his life &s;hould prove it to me.</P>
<P>All I a&s;k, my Lord, is liberty to leave this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>How was I delighted, Sophia, to hear him, without he&s;itationi, grant my re|que&s;t. I really believed he at la&s;t began
<PB N="208" REF="207">to repent of what he had done. True, he u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible endeavour to di&s;|&s;uade me from my purpo&s;e, but finding nothing would prevail, he left me to compo&s;e my &s;pirits, and at lei&s;ure, to reflect on the plan I meant to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Alas, Sophia! on what could I <HI>now</HI> determine? Forbid my Aunt's, forbid my father's hou&s;e, their doors for ever &s;hut again&s;t me&mdash;to whom could I fly for protection? My mind was in a &s;tate of di&s;traction; my thoughts all confu&s;ion, I could fix on nothing, but at all events to leave the man I had &s;o much rea&s;on to dread.</P>
<P>Finding I did not &s;end for him again as I had promi&s;ed, when I came to &s;ome re&s;olution, he retrned to me, and beg|ged I would calmly li&s;ten to a propo&s;al he had to offer, which he flatttered him|&s;elf would meet my approbation.</P>
<P>This was, &s;ince I would not be pre|vailed upon to ble&s;s him longer with my company, which he valued more than life, that I would conde&s;cend to re&s;ide for a while in a hou&s;e of his in the coun|try, where I &s;hould be perfectly retired, and where I might, without tho&s;e deli|cate
<PB N="209" REF="208">&s;cruples which now robbed him of me, try every means to make my peace with my family, who would perhaps be more readily reconciled to me, when no longer with him.</P>
<P>I naturally objected to this, as being &s;till his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He replied, they might remain igno|rant of that circum&s;tance, as he never had lived there, and repeatedly &s;wore he never would attempt to vi&s;it me with|out my permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed a while, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, not knowing on what to re|&s;olve; at length, however, I con&s;idered I might po&s;&s;ibly find it ea&s;ier, as he &s;aid, to make my peace there, than while under his immediate protection; and, I confe&s;s, I &s;huddered at the idea of find|ing my&s;elt in London without a &s;ingle friend to whom I could apply for it&mdash;tho&s;e in the country, I feared, might be as much prejudiced again&s;t me as my own family.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sophia, I agreed; glad, be|yond expre&s;&s;ion, at his con&s;ent at any rate to my relea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="209">He begged me to delay my cruel pur|po&s;e for a day or two, that he might write to his &s;teward to get every thing in order for my reception; his hou&s;ekeeper was al&s;o to accompany me, and to conti|nue as long as I found her nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The happy wi&s;hed-for hour of my de|liverance at length arrived&mdash;I left him, Sophia, and though &s;till di&s;tracted with ten thou&s;and painful apprehen&s;ions for the future, found my heart relieved from great part of its di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I had &s;till many doubts of his &s;incerity&mdash;I could not ea&s;ily per&s;uade my|&s;elf he had wholly given up his di&s;ho|nourable views; the change in his &s;enti|ments was too &s;uddden, after all the arti|fice, all the trouble he had taken to get me into his power, to leave me without &s;u&s;picion; but, to get from him was a great point gained.</P>
<P>I might be mi&s;taken; it was <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> he might be le&s;s wicked than he had hitherto appeared;&mdash;at any rate it was infinitely better than continuing where I was; <HI>that,</HI> was certain mi&s;ery, this &s;tep might pre|vent my ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="210">Thank heaven! my dear Sophia, this has been effected; for Providence, ever kind and merciful, &s;ent me a friend when lea&s;t expected; an amiable, generous, compa&s;&s;ionate friend, who does me the ju&s;tice to believe me innocent, though un|fortunate; and who, by every obliging attention, endeavours to make me forget the pa&s;t, and look forward to happier days.</P>
<P>We &s;et out pretty early in the morn|ing. Mrs. Wat&s;on, the name of my tra|velling companion, and who I till then had looked upon as a decent good kind of woman, now began to talk to me with more freedom and familiarity than &s;he had ever pre&s;umed to do, ran out in mo&s;t ridiculous prai&s;es of her Lord, &s;aid he was the mo&s;t generous, the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t of men, that where he once took a fancy (this, Sophia, was her elegant ex|pre&s;&s;ion) he &s;pared no expence, nothing was too good or too dear.</P>
<P>Ah! you are a fortunate young lady I am &s;ure, (continued &s;he) how many, no le&s;s beautiful, would envy your &s;ituation! Here now you are going to reign &s;ole mi&s;|tre&s;s of the &s;weete&s;t &s;pot that ever you
<PB N="212" REF="211">&s;aw in your life; and, to be &s;ure, 'tis far more agreeable than being cooped up in London as you were.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;&s;hocked&mdash;and all my fears returned; fully convinced &s;he was &s;ent with me merely as a guard, to prevent any attempt I might make to e&s;cape: &s;he dur&s;t not have talked in this &s;tyle had not her vile employer let her fully into his infamous intentions; &s;he, no doubt, had her in&s;tructions, and, I am per&s;uaded, would have been but too faithful to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her.</P>
<P>I made few an&s;wers to her imperti|nence, but &s;uffered her to run on as &s;he plea&s;ed, fully determined to proceed no further than the inn we were to &s;leep at, if I could po&s;&s;ibly help it. I took care, however, to &s;ay nothing likely to create &s;u&s;picion; &s;he then had none, believing I was perfectly &s;atisfied with my condi|tion.</P>
<P>When arrived at the la&s;t &s;tage of that day's journey we &s;topped, and &s;he went to order beds and &s;upper.&mdash;I ob&s;erved an ele|gant carriage in the court-yard as we came in. Ah, what would I have given to have known whether it belonged to male or fe|male;
<PB N="213" REF="212">if the latter, I was determined to contrive &s;ome means of making my &s;itua|tion known. Alas! I had already been too cruelly deceived by the former, ever to tru&s;t them more.</P>
<P>On Wat&s;on's return, I carele&s;sly a&s;ked her if &s;he knew the owner; as I was then viewing it from the window, being &s;till light enough for that purpo&s;e. Know! Yes, that I do full well! and little does Lady Mary Craven gue&s;s, I fancy, <HI>I</HI> am here, unle&s;s &s;he may have &s;een my Lord's carriage, as you have &s;een her's. Mercy on us! What would &s;he &s;ay, did &s;he know as much as <HI>I</HI> know! &s;he would tear your eyes out!</P>
<P>My eyes! (amazed.) What on earth do you mean?</P>
<P>Mean! Why &s;urely you mu&s;t have heard his Lord&s;hip talk of her; why &s;he is the very per&s;on he was to have married! Aye, and <HI>would</HI> have married had he not taken &s;uch a fancy to you, at lea&s;t the world &s;ays &s;o; and to tell you the truth, I believe it; but to be &s;ure his honour has a right to do as he thinks fit; though by not doing it, he mu&s;t, they &s;ay, lo&s;e great part of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="213">Sophia! can you conceive my afto|ni&s;hment? I was now, if po&s;&s;ible, more anxious to meet with an opportunity of &s;peaking to her: much I had indeed heard of her, and even my cruel betray|er &s;poke of her with e&s;teem, though he had hitherto declined fulfilling his en|gagement.</P>
<P>The horrid phra&s;e the creature had made u&s;e of &s;hocked me, I in&s;tantly con|ceived her Lady&s;hip had heard of my in|tended union with him; and al&s;o, per|haps, of what had &s;ince happened. I felt mortified, exceedingly &s;o, and would have given worlds for an opportunity to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, but how to procure it I knew not.</P>
<P>A thought occured to me; the fir&s;t time Wat&s;on left the room, which &s;he fre|quently did, as I pre&s;ume &s;he found the people of the hou&s;e more cheerful com|panions than I was.</P>
<P>I took a &s;lip of paper, which fortunate|ly lay on the table, and with my pencil wrote a few lines, &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ing the mi&s;ery of my &s;ituation, and begging, for the love of heaven! her Lady&s;hip would conde&s;cend to &s;ee me! The means of
<PB N="215" REF="214">doing &s;o I left to her&s;elf, as I could think of none likely to &s;ucceed, without creat|ing &s;u&s;picion in the creature I had every rea&s;on to believe was placed over me as a &s;py.</P>
<P>This I &s;ealed, and gave the waiter, who came to cover the table for &s;upper, charging him to convey it in&s;tantly into the Lady's own hand.&mdash;<HI>He</HI> could have no rea&s;on to refu&s;e this reque&s;t&mdash;away he went, and left me agitated with ten thou|&s;and hopes and fears.</P>
<P>Near half an hour elap&s;ed before his return.&mdash;I &s;at in terrors. Wat&s;on had two or three times been in the room dur|ing his ab&s;ence, but &s;till finding little plea&s;ure in my company, made her vi&s;its very &s;hort.</P>
<P>To my no &s;mall joy, at la&s;t the waiter entered, Sophia, and giving me a &s;ealed note, &s;aid, if I had any further commands, I had only to ring the bell, and he would attend.</P>
<P>I opened it, trembling from head to foot, and had &s;carce power to read the contents; my eyes grew perfectly dim, I feared I &s;hould faint; however, a gla&s;s of water, which I in&s;tantly drank, relieved
<PB N="216" REF="215">me.&mdash;The&s;e were the few words the dear paper contained: MADAM, "I FEEL my&s;elf much intere&s;ted in your happine&s;s; I cannot doubt the facts you have mentioned, they are dreadful! Your applying to a &s;tranger, is a convinc|ing proof the &s;ituation you are in is not agreeable to you; depend on &s;eeing me this evening; I will contrive to di&s;po&s;e of the woman you tell me has the charge of you, and &s;hall be happy to render you any &s;ervice in my power."</P>
<P>Heavens! Sophia! judge what were my feelings at that delightful moment; it is not in the power of language to give you an idea of them! Supper came in a moment after, and Wat&s;on followed it.</P>
<P>I feared &s;he would remark the change which mu&s;t have taken place in my coun|tenance: at dinner I had de&s;ired her to &s;it at table with me; but now, under pre|tence that &s;he would be better amu&s;ed el&s;ewhere, I told her I would di&s;pen&s;e with her company; &s;he &s;eemed perfectly fati&s;fied. I, Sophia, was &s;till more &s;o.&mdash;I &s;oon fini&s;hed my repa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="216">The cloth was but ju&s;t removed when the door opened, and in came my gene|rous friend! for well does her Lady&s;hip merit that tender appellation.</P>
<P>Ah, Madam! (covered with blu&s;hes, and attempting to throw my&s;elf at her feet) can you pardon an unhappy young creature for pre&s;uming to take &s;o great a liberty? Were I al&s;o a guilty one, believe me, I would not have.&mdash;</P>
<P>Say no more&mdash;make no apologies, ten|derly rai&s;ing me, and taking my hand in the mo&s;t engaging manner, I have not a doubt of your innocence; that lovely countenance, that amiable timidity, tho&s;e artle&s;s blu&s;hes, plainly declare it.</P>
<P>Sit down, (continued &s;he, &s;eating her|&s;elf by me, and &s;till kindly holding my hand) we have no time to lo&s;e in idle ce|remony; I am not intirely a &s;tranger to your &s;tory, I have even heard part of it &s;ince I came into this hou&s;e; your duenna has not the talent of keeping a &s;ecret; &s;he has already been talking of it to my wo|man, and no doubt to others; but it is of no con&s;equence, if you wi&s;h to e&s;cape from her.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="217">Ah, Madam! (interrupting her) it is all I a&s;k of heaven.</P>
<P>Enough, my lovely girl, depend upon it you &s;hall then; and for all other matters, we will leave them to talk over at more lei&s;ure; at pre&s;ent, let us think only how to manage the fir&s;t point; yet it will not, I believe, require much con|trivance: I think the wretch will not dare to di&s;pute my authority.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent for a moment; then &s;aid, I have ordered my woman to keep her in chat till I return, and that will be no very difficult matter, for &s;he &s;eems an arrant go&s;&s;ip; but I have changed my mind, &s;he may as well find me here, my pre&s;ence, I am per&s;uaded, will not pro|duce any bad effect: ring for her, Mi&s;s Herbert, and without &s;cruple, &s;ay, you have accepted the offer I have made you, of &s;leeping with me; let her form what conjectures &s;he plea&s;es, my life for it, &s;he will not dare to oppo&s;e your de&s;ign.</P>
<P>How, my dear Madam, &s;hall I ever repay this goodne&s;s; this un&s;peakable obligation? (taking her hand, and re&s;|pectfully pre&s;&s;ing it to my lips.)</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="218">
O! very ea&s;ily, my dear! But we will talk of that another time, you for|get that I have a double plea&s;ure in what I am now doing: fir&s;t, I hope I am &s;erving you; and &s;econdly, di&s;appoint|ing a man who richly de&s;erves &s;ome mor|tification from me. You know not how I enjoy the thoughts of his amazement, when he hears his intended wife, and <HI>in|tended mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> have &s;o accidentally had a <HI>rencontre.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, my dear, for the expre&s;|&s;ion; it can only ca&s;t a reflection on the wicked &s;educer! His vile intentions <HI>you</HI> have nothing to do with, he is a wild good for nothing moital, nor have I ever, believe me, regretted his not claiming my hand, which, I give you my word, would have been to no purpo&s;e; I &s;hall chu&s;e to be&s;tow it on a worthier object, I do a&s;&s;ure you; but ring your bell if you plea&s;e, it is late, and we mu&s;t &s;et out early to-morrow, as I mean to get home in the evening.</P>
<P>Is &s;he not a delightful woman, Sophia?&mdash;I obeyed, and the waiter entered.</P>
<P>Tell the per&s;on who came with me, &s;aid I, I &s;hall be glad to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="219">
She made her appearance a moment after; but, to give you an idea of her a&s;toni&s;hment on &s;eeing my companion is utterly impo&s;&s;ible. I could hardly keep my gravity.</P>
<P>Your young Lady (&s;aid Lady Mary) has been &s;o good as to &s;ay &s;he will oblige me by &s;teeping in my room to night; you may carry her things there, my maid will &s;how you the way.</P>
<P>Madam! my Lady!&mdash;I&mdash;I!&mdash;in your room, did your Lady&s;hip &s;ay?&mdash;I&mdash;fear!&mdash;that is, I!&mdash;</P>
<P>O! fear nothing! I will take as much care of her as you can do. I am rather a coward, and dare not &s;leep alone; you may go, we &s;hall follow you pre&s;ently. Order my woman to bring lights.</P>
<P>Sophia, never was there a more comic &s;cene; the creature was ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ink into the earth&mdash;the &s;tyle in which my kind friend &s;poke to her; the ea&s;y man|ner; as if &s;he took it for granted <HI>&s;he</HI> could have no objections, &s;o wholly di&s;|concerted the few ideas nature had given her, that &s;he could <HI>make</HI> none.</P>
<P>Never mortal looked &s;o &s;ooli&s;h. She had nothing for it but to &s;neak off and
<PB N="221" REF="220">obey. Taken &s;o entirely unawares, &s;o unprepared for &s;uch an event, what could &s;he do? She was utterly confounded, and unable to &s;ay one word either for or again&s;t the plan, &s;o left us to enjoy her perplexity; which we certainly did not a little.</P>
<P>Soon after her Lady&s;hip's woman came to let us know our apartment was ready&mdash;&s;he, too, looked amazed, but &s;aid nothing. In the entry we found Wat|&s;on, accompanied by the &s;ervant (who had attended us from London) and al&s;o the po&s;tillion; as I pa&s;&s;ed &s;he attempted to &s;top me.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s, Mi&s;s! Pray let me &s;peak one word? For heaven &s;ake do!&mdash;John!&mdash;Richard!&mdash;can't your!&mdash;I wi&s;h&mdash;they &s;tood gaping, but made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I &s;lid by; &s;aying, &s;he could have no|thing to tell me but what I could hear as well in the morning; and, with trem|bling &s;teps, &s;carce able to &s;upport my&s;elf, hurried up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>It was evident &s;he had made this effort to prevent me; and certainly might have made a very di&s;agreeable bu&s;tle, had her auxiliary troops &s;econded her motion
<PB N="222" REF="221">with &s;pirit; but happily, for me, they did not. They had, I pre&s;ume, received no orders from their ma&s;ter on the &s;ub|ject; who, with all his art and cunning, had not, I fancy, fore&s;een that &s;uch an accident <HI>might</HI> happen; perhaps too, though &s;o greatly his inferior in &s;ome things, they might be no le&s;s &s;uperior in others; and &s;corned to be farther con|cerned in &s;o treacherous an affair.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear Sophia, every thing fortunately &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;h. Next morning we left the hou&s;e, without in|terruption.&mdash;Wat&s;on was not even vi&s;i|ble; I gave every thing I had been obliged to receive from her, to one of the &s;er|vants, charging her to deliver them into her own hands; and with a joy you can have no conception of, drove to this ho&s;|pitable, this delightful man&s;ion, where I meet with every po&s;&s;ible attention and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>My only di&s;tre&s;s now is, the di&s;plea|&s;ure of my dear Father and Aunt; could I but obtain their forgivene&s;s, my heart would be at peace. Lady Mary has kindly promi&s;ed to intercede for me; I mean to write again; &s;he is to write al&s;o.
<PB N="223" REF="222">Ah, Sophia! pray with me her eloquence may not plead in vain; this alone is wanting to complete my felicity.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear friend, you &s;hall hear from me again when the&s;e important let|ters are di&s;patched, and then have a more particular account of my generous protectre&s;s; there cannot be a more amiable creature&mdash;Ah! the deceitful, the cruel Sommerville, is unworthy of her! She knows it now better than ever. She dete&s;ts him for his perfidy to your poor Emily; and I need not, I hope, add, <HI>I</HI> too look upon him as the ba&s;e&s;t of men. Thank heaven, I have happily e&s;caped all his &s;nares! May he, before it is too late, &s;ee his errors and repent!</P>
<P>I go now to write to my father and aunt, &s;hould their an&s;wers be propitious, I &s;hall be once more your truly happy, as well as affectionate,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. <HI>Lord Sommerville to Charles Dalton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NEVER! Never Charles, was there &s;o unfortunate a fellow as I am at this moment; by heavens! I could cur&s;e my very exi&s;tence, for being &s;uch a con|founded fool! duped by an artful witch, I have acted the part of a con&s;ummate villain! I have injured, in&s;ulted, the be&s;t, the mo&s;t e&s;timable of her &s;ex, and have de&s;ervedly lo&s;t her for ever! Yes, &s;he mu&s;t look upon me as the mo&s;t de|te&s;table, the mo&s;t unworthy of mankind; but here I &s;wear by all that's &s;acred, I will be nobly revenged! that fiend, in the &s;hape of Lady Stanley, &s;hall not e&s;cape with impunity: dearly &s;hall &s;he be made to rue the effects of her diabo|lical plotting, or my wits &s;hall &s;ail me.</P>
<P>Oh, Charles! I am undone! ruined! all my hopes of happine&s;s for ever de|&s;troyed!
<PB N="225" REF="224">by that vile harpy's contrivance, my Emily! my lovely, my engaging, gentle Emily!&mdash;mu&s;t at this moment exe|crate the very name of her repenting, truly penitent Sommerville! I am now a&s;toni&s;hed at my &s;tupid credulity! How was it in nature, I could believe &s;o &s;can|dalous, &s;o improbable a &s;tory? her very looks! every word! every &s;weet expre&s;|&s;ion the dear girl uttered!&mdash;her letters, which, I like a mean de&s;picable traitor &s;aw, by &s;uch unju&s;tifiable means, all! all might have told me it was fal&s;e.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e artle&s;s, innocent letters, &s;he calls me a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> Charles! Too ju&s;tly might the lovely injured creature look upon me in that odious light! No never! never while I have breath, &s;hall I reco|ver <HI>my own</HI> good opinion! How then dare I, can I hope to regain hers? and yet without that ble&s;&s;ing, life mu&s;t be a tor|ment.</P>
<P>But let me endeavour to be more expli|cit, that you may comprehend me, and you will then confe&s;s I have but too much cau&s;e for the&s;e exclamations.</P>
<P>My adorable Emily, not wholly void of &s;u&s;picion, (I now know to my co&s;t) le&s;t me, accompanied by Wat&s;on, as I men|tioned
<PB N="226" REF="225">to you we had agreed upon. The very next day, to my utter confu&s;ion, I received the following letter from my friend, Major Man&s;ell; judge if you can of my emotions, on reading its dreadful contents.</P>
<P>Had this reached me a few days &s;oon|er, it might have &s;aved me from endle&s;s remor&s;e, and I might now have been &s;u|premely ble&s;t in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my an|gel, Emily; for angels are not more pure, more &s;potle&s;s.&mdash;Ah, Charles! I ought never to have entertained a doubt of it; but my con&s;cience tells me, I was unworthy to call &s;uch excellence mine.</P>
<P>Read Man&s;ell's letter, and then &s;ay, is there any puni&s;hment I can contrive, equal to crimes of that hagg, Lady Stanley?</P>
<P><HI>My dear Sommerville,</HI></P>
<P>I THINK I know you too well to be|lieve my &s;ucceeding your Lord&s;hip in the good graces of the fair widow, gave you one moment's unea&s;ine&s;s, or that it could po&s;&s;ibly weaken your friend&s;hip; as a
<PB N="227" REF="226">proof of mine, accept this letter, which I wi&s;h from my &s;oul, may come time enough to prevent tho&s;e infamous effects, which an injured, a jealous woman in|tended to produce by arts &s;he practiced, with but too much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I had long &s;u&s;pected the indifference &s;he affected, on your quitting her for the amiable, the much injured, Mi&s;s Herbert, was merely put on to conceal the pangs it gave her; it was unnatural to imagine a conque&s;t, like Lord Som|merville, could be re&s;igned with &s;o much ea&s;e; you cannot have forgot how often I have &s;aid I doubted her Lady&s;hip's &s;incerity, I have now mo&s;t inconte&s;table proofs of my penetration.</P>
<P>You know I was on a pretty intimate footing with her before you left us; &s;he has attractions, my Lord, and knows how to &s;et them off to advantage as well as any one of her &s;ex. I had no &s;erious views in the devoirs I paid her; &s;he could not but know it, I have therefore nothing to reproach my&s;elf with.</P>
<P>I often talked of your Lord&s;hip, I wi&s;hed to di&s;cover her real &s;entiments, as I &s;u&s;pected them, and did all in my
<PB N="228" REF="227">power to throw her off her guard; I part|ly &s;ucceeded, and was fully convinced, by her own confe&s;&s;ion (though &s;he did not, I believe, mean to be quite &s;o expli|cit, had I not artfully drawn her on by my que&s;tions, and appearing to admire her &s;pirit) that the lovely Emily was car|ried off by her contrivance.</P>
<P>My manner of treating the affair gratified her vanity, and &s;he was weak enough, in the cour&s;e of &s;everal conver|&s;ations I had with her on the &s;ubject, not only to own it, but to triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of her cruel plot, laughing at the fellow who had been her dupe, and the reward he had met with for his heroic achievement.</P>
<P>I al&s;o found &s;he had formed hopes of drawing you again into her lure, having thus robbed you of her charming rival; this, it is true, &s;he had too much pride to acknowledge in direct terms; but I more than &s;urmi&s;ed it from &s;everal unguarded expre&s;&s;ions &s;he occa&s;ionally dropped.</P>
<P>You, my dear Sommerville, returned un&s;ucce&s;sful, after having made every po&s;&s;ible inquiry, in order to di&s;cover the wretch who had injured you in &s;o flagrant
<PB N="229" REF="228">a manner, you had &s;earched in vain, and it appears her hopes of regaining your heart were no le&s;s &s;o, &s;he could not con|ceal her mortification at the di&s;appoint|ment even from me.</P>
<P>You &s;oon di&s;appeared a &s;econd time.&mdash;Little did I dream Lady Stanley was the &s;ecret &s;pring that occa&s;ioned your &s;udden departure.</P>
<P>But of this, too, I have by mere acci|dent di&s;covered &s;uch evident proofs as almo&s;t amount to certainty.</P>
<P>Going a few days ago to call upon her, I found &s;he had walked out, but had or|dered the &s;ervants, in ca&s;e I came before &s;he returned, to &s;ay &s;he &s;hould be at home pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Accordingly I went up to her dre&s;&s;ing room to wait for her, meaning to amu&s;e my&s;elf with a book till &s;he arrived; I &s;aw none on her toilet, and began looking about in hopes of finding one; her cabi|net &s;tood open, I fancied I might meet with one there; &s;everal letters and loo&s;e papers lay &s;cattered up and down; and there they might have lain in perfect &s;a&s;e|ty for me, had not my eye caught the name of Mi&s;s Herbert on one of them;
<PB N="230" REF="229">all things con&s;idered, I think my curio|&s;ity was pardonable&mdash;I took it up&mdash;but gue&s;s my &s;urprize when I found it addre&s;|&s;ed to your Lord&s;hip, as coming from the fellow's hou&s;ekeeper who had carried off your lovely Emily.&mdash;I ha&s;tily took a copy, which I enclo&s;e, that you may be enabled to judge whether you ever re|ceived &s;uch a one&mdash;if &s;o, we cannot doubt her being the author, as it is in her Lady|&s;hip's own hand writing, though &s;he would hardly &s;end it to you without being &s;u&s;|ficiently di&s;gui&s;ed, or more likely, get &s;ome other to write it for her.</P>
<P>One of the two you may depend on, for how el&s;e could &s;he come by &s;uch a wicked abominable &s;crawl?&mdash;true&mdash;it might never have been &s;ent, one can hardly believe any woman could be ca|pable of &s;uch an infernal &s;cheme; but this your Lord&s;hip will be able to clear up to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I would gladly hope, &s;he did not carry her malice and revenge quite &s;o &s;ar, and if &s;he actually did, that you would give no credit to the horrid &s;tory; &s;ince in that ca&s;e I fear the amiable Mi&s;s Herbert, in regard to whom I am told your inten|tions
<PB N="231" REF="230">before her unfortunate adventure were perfectly honourable, may have &s;unk in your Lord&s;hip's e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Whether the wretch really did treat her with indignity&mdash;whether he was brute enough to take advantage of her unhap|py &s;ituation, having her thus in his power, I cannot &s;ay&mdash;but this vile forgery is at lea&s;t no proof of it.</P>
<P>It is &s;u&s;pected the lovely girl is now your's, my Lord; but this wants con|firmation; her friends, I hear, have not yet been able to trace her &s;teps, or to di&s;|cover who it was that delivered her from Morton; however by the de&s;cription he gives of the per&s;on, they gue&s;s it is your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>But if &s;o, why does &s;he not appear?&mdash;This que&s;tion I a&s;k, and can only account for it, by &s;uppo&s;ing, what I am very un|willing to believe.</P>
<P>By our pa&s;t friend&s;hip, my dear Som|merville, let me entreat the favour of hearing from you, and if po&s;&s;ible clear your&s;elf from &s;u&s;picions which pain me to entertain. I know you are not fault|le&s;s more than my&s;elf; the very be&s;t of us are not &s;o; but &s;urely, my Lord, you
<PB N="232" REF="231">would re&s;pect the virtue of a young lady &s;o truly de&s;erving your tenderne&s;s and protection.</P>
<P>Pardon the freedom of the&s;e reflections in con&s;ideration of the motives which in|duce me to trouble you with this letter; that it may fully an&s;wer my well meant purpo&s;e, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of your Lord|&s;hip's affectionate friend, and mo&s;t obe|dient &s;ervant,</P>
<P>F. MANSELL.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted you have now, Charles, read my friend's di&s;tracting let|ter, let me a&s;k what puni&s;hment you think &s;ufficiently &s;evere for the author of all this mi&s;ery?&mdash;I need not remind you of my receiving the cur&s;ed &s;crawl, of which he found the copy, you know it&mdash;and know al&s;o, I was dolt, idiot enough to give credit to the vile tale, and al&s;o the fatal, the unpardonable effects of my too ea&s;y credulity.</P>
<P>Ah, Charles! they have for ever de|&s;troyed my peace! I now, when too late, find my injured! much injured Emily! is dearer to me than life, that to call her
<PB N="233" REF="232">mine, honourably mine, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to my happine&s;s that I think I &s;hall not have patience to endure the in&s;ipidity of my exi&s;tence without her!</P>
<P>And yet what hopes remain? None I am afraid! &s;he cannot but de&s;pi&s;e my conduct, ignorant as &s;he is of the cruel deception that had been practi&s;ed, and con&s;cious of her innocence, I mu&s;t appear a brute.</P>
<P>Well might the angelic girl call me mon&s;ter; had I not obtained the promi&s;e of her dear hand? Were we not on the point of being for ever united by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties? What had <HI>&s;he</HI> done then to produce &s;o horrid a change in my &s;enti|ments!&mdash;Ah, nothing! Nothing!</P>
<P>I am ab&s;olutely more than half di&s;tract|ed, Charles, and cannot proceed, though I have &s;till much to tell you, and much you will wonder, I am certain, at the &s;trange event I am going to relate; you will con|fe&s;s it is one of tho&s;e unaccountable acci|dents, which one can hardly conceive happen by chance&mdash;yet, &s;o it certainly was.</P>
<P>The account Wat&s;on gives, (whom I had nearly put to death in my fir&s;t tran&s;|port
<PB N="234" REF="233">of rage and di&s;appointment) is as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>At the inn, where my Emily was to &s;leep the fir&s;t night of her journey, who&s;e carriage do you think, Charles, was the fir&s;t object the &s;tupid animal &s;aw &s;tanding in the yard? and which &s;he well knew, as &s;he had &s;een it often, nor was &s;he ignorant of my engage|ment with its owner!&mdash;No other than Lady Mary Craven's!</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, my Lord, I had no notion of what would happen&mdash;how &s;hould I? (cried &s;he, when attempting to ju&s;tify her&s;elf)&mdash;I knew her Lady&s;hip's woman, and thought there could be no harm in chatting to her a little; and plea&s;e your honour, I am &s;ure I &s;aid nothing that could di&s;cover my bu&s;ine&s;s there, nor did I know Mi&s;s Herbert was acquainted with her Lady&s;hip; nay, for that matter, &s;he certainly was not, for her maid told me &s;o.</P>
<P>What you mentioned her name then, and told her &s;he was with you? (cried I, in a rage.)</P>
<P>Oh, dear, my Lord!&mdash;Indeed, indeed! I&mdash;I!&mdash;that is I only!&hellip;</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234">Go on, (interrupting her) &s;carce able to contain my indignation.</P>
<P>Why, my Lord, when Mi&s;s rang her bell and ordered me to attend, which I &s;uppo&s;ed was to conduct her to her bed|chamber, who &s;hould I find &s;itting in the very &s;ame room with her, but Lady Mary. Your honour may well think I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed, and knew not what to &s;ay or do.</P>
<P>I have prevailed on Mi&s;s Herbert (&s;aid &s;he) to &s;leep in my apartment to night; ju&s;t for all the world, plea&s;e your Lord|&s;hip, as if they had been the mo&s;t intimate friends. Go, carry your Lady's things up &s;tairs, my woman will &s;how you the way&mdash;the&s;e were her Lady&s;hip's very words, my Lord. I &s;tood like a fool, to be &s;ure, for what could I &s;ay?&mdash;I never was &s;o &s;lu&s;tered in all my days; at la&s;t, however, I did venture to &s;ay &s;omething, though I hardly know what; but her Lady&s;hip cut me &s;hort, by repeating her orders, &s;o I was obliged to obey.</P>
<P>When come a little to my&s;elf, I ran to John and Richard, and bid them &s;tand by me, and I would try to prevent her getting up &s;tairs&mdash;I trembled every joint of me,
<PB N="236" REF="235">as I waited their coming&mdash;but it was all to no purpo&s;e. Mi&s;s, &s;ome how or other, &s;lipped by me, though I once had hold of her gown too, and they &s;tood looking on, never &s;o much as putting out a hand to help me, or daring to &s;peak a word.</P>
<P>And, &s;o, plea&s;e your honour, next morning, they were both gone in her La|dy&s;hip's carriage, before I was up; and one of the maids delivered me all her things; that is, the trunk, and the key; and to be &s;ure, I found every individual thing in it, except the cloaths &s;he had on.</P>
<P>Confe&s;s, Charles, this is a very extra|ordinary event;&mdash;mo&s;t unaccountably &s;o; how, in the cour&s;e of a few hours&mdash;nay le&s;s, &s;he could contrive to introduce her&s;elf to an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, to intere&s;t her &s;o much in her favour, (yet who could behold the &s;weet creature with indiffer|ence?) to contract &s;uch an intimacy! &s;uch a friend&s;hip!&mdash;I am bewildered! perplexed&mdash;and what is wor&s;e, feel all the horrors of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>I ab&s;olutely cannot upport the torment of her thinking me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> villain.&mdash;And how ju&s;tify my&s;elf? granting I could, by re|lating
<PB N="237" REF="236">facts, mitigate my offences? How attempt &s;eeing her in the pre&s;ence of her new friend? How appear before <HI>her?</HI> Had &s;he fallen into any other hands, I might have found courage for it, de&s;pica|ble as I mu&s;t be in her dear eyes; but here it is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I have de&s;erved &s;ome reproaches al&s;o, I am &s;orry to fay, from her Ladys;hip:&mdash;Ah! how will my character be torn to pieces between them; what a &s;ubject for their <HI>t&egrave;te-&acirc;-t&egrave;tes?</HI> Could my evil genius have been more perver&s;e, than in thus bringing the only two women acquaint|ed, I wi&s;hed might never meet! There is a whim&s;icallity in it, Charles, which, were I not half mad with vexation, would force a &s;mile.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TEN thou&s;and thanks to my dear Sophia, for her obliging congratulations on all my troubles being happily over:&mdash;they are nearer being &s;o, my dear friend, than you yet know. You &s;ay you have not a doubt of my being &s;oon re&s;tored to the favour of my family; you are not mi&s;taken; I have received the tendere&s;t letter imaginable from my Aunt, who gives me hopes my dear Fa|ther will pardon all the trouble I have involuntarily occa&s;ioned him: nay, does now pardon me, but cannot yet &s;o far
<PB N="239" REF="238">&s;ucceed as to gain my Mother's permi&s;&s;ion for me to return home.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance gives much plea&s;ure to my generous friend, who had pre&s;&s;ed me not to leave this place; and if oblig|ed to go for a while, in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould re|turn, and if po&s;&s;ible, &s;pend &s;ome months with her; finding how matters were at my Father's, and that of cour&s;e I was to go to my Aunt, &s;he has wrote in the mo&s;t polite and pre&s;&s;ing terms to beg &s;he will &s;pare me to her for &s;ome time; I think &s;he will not refu&s;e &s;ome flattering a reque&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, Sophia, let me tell you, though it will &s;hock you as much as it has me, to find <HI>man</HI> can be &s;o very ba&s;e, &s;o wholly lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of honour, I find Lord Sommerville is more guilty, more treacherous than even <HI>I</HI> till now be|lieved him; though, alas, there needed no further proo&s; to render him, in my opinion, completely worthle&s;s.</P>
<P>Would you believe it, Sophia, my Aunt tells me &s;he never received the let|ter I wrote her, and to which I received &s;o cruel an an&s;wer.&mdash;How mean! how horrid, to &s;toop to &s;uch artifice!&mdash;It is now evident he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and,
<PB N="240" REF="239">in order to facilitate his vile &s;chemes, wrote the an&s;wer him&s;elf, which gave me &s;uch infinite pain and di&s;tre&s;s: that to you, no doubt, &s;hared the &s;ame fate, &s;ince you wrote me word you never received it.</P>
<P>Good heaven, Sophia! that a man &s;o apparently amiable and generous, &s;o very &s;uperior to the generality of his &s;ex, &s;hould, under tho&s;e engaging appearances, conceal &s;o bad a heart, &s;o de&s;picable a character.</P>
<P>Ah, how thankful am I, our intended union did not take place; mi&s;ery mu&s;t inevitably have been the con&s;equence, what el&s;e could have followed? Though for a while I might have been deceived; &s;oon, too &s;oon, I doubt not he would have thrown off the ma&s;k, and your poor Emily would have been completely wretched.</P>
<P>Have I not then infinite cau&s;e to thank the merciful interpo&s;ition of Providence, for delivering me from &s;o dreadful a fate; and al&s;o for procuring me &s;o amiable a friend as I find in my generous, my kind protectre&s;s.</P>
<P>My dear Lady Mary informs me, te greate&s;t friend&s;hip had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
<PB N="241" REF="240">her Father and the late Lord Sommer|ville, that an alliance between the fami|lies had for many years been an object on which they had both &s;et their hearts; that in an affair of the utmo&s;t importance, her's had conferred a very e&s;&s;ential obli|gation on his friend: this he could no otherwi&s;e repay, than by confirming the promi&s;e he had before given, that his &s;on &s;hould, &s;ince his Lord&s;hip did him the honour to wi&s;h it, either give his hand, or for&s;eit half his e&s;tate, which in that ca&s;e &s;hould be &s;ettled on the lady. To this her father objected&mdash;but in vain; it was the only return he could make, he &s;aid, and &s;hould his &s;on be &s;o blind to his own intere&s;t and happine&s;s as to refu&s;e fulfilling the engagement, (a thing he had no rea&s;on to fear) he thought in &s;ettling his fortune in this manner, he inflicted but too mild a puni&s;hment for his folly and ingratitude.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip's father died before &s;he had attained her fifteenth year; &s;he then accompanied her Aunt (who &s;till lives with her) abroad.</P>
<P>Lord Sommerville died &s;ome years after; his &s;on, who was then on his tra|vels,
<PB N="242" REF="241">was &s;ent for home, but arrived too late, as his father had breathed his la&s;t: what his &s;entiments were, on finding the clau&s;e I have mentioned fully ratified, &s;he can only gue&s;s by his conduct, which pretty clearly informed her he had no in|clination to perform the &s;tipulated en|gagement.</P>
<P>One thing I had almo&s;t forgot, which is, that they are &s;econd cou&s;ins; and, that Sommerville &s;ucceeded to the e&s;tate he now enjoys, in con&s;equence of its being entailed on the male heir, otherwi&s;e it would have devolved to Lady Mary; &s;o that &s;trictly &s;peaking, he is not to forfeit any part of <HI>it,</HI> but which is nearly the &s;ame thing, is to pay to her an equivalent &s;um of money.</P>
<P>The&s;e, in as few words as I could give you them, are the particulars of that affair; he has never been more attentive to her than even cold good breeding requires; and happy it is her Lady&s;hip never be|held him with any degree of partiality; &s;he wi&s;hed him to reject her, yet would not inform him of her &s;entiments, merely that &s;he might have it in her power to puni&s;h him for his irregularities, well
<PB N="243" REF="242">knowing he is highly povoked at being thus fettered.</P>
<P>Her own fortune is very con&s;iderable, nor does &s;he mean to augment it by the &s;um &s;he is, on his rejecting her hand, to receive from him: had he proved him|&s;elf more worthy, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, &s;he intended re&s;igning her claim; but &s;ince he is &s;uch a libertine, &s;he propo&s;es ac|cepting the money, and &s;ettling it on a young gentleman, his Lord&s;hip's neare&s;t relation, who is uncommonly amiable and de&s;erving, but who&s;e family e&s;tate, by the extravagance of his predece&s;&s;or, is reduced almo&s;t to nothing.</P>
<P>This, Sophia, is her generous inten|tion, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to find an objec|tion to it: the artful, the de&s;igning Som|merville will, after all, in his e&s;tate, po&s;|&s;e&s;s but too much for the ba&s;e purpo&s;es in which he employs it.</P>
<P>Lady Mary has a great &s;hare of vivaci|ty, and often diverts me when talking of Lord Sommerville's embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, and the a&s;toni&s;hment he mu&s;t have been in on hearing of our fir&s;t meeting, and that I am now actually re&s;ident with her&mdash;it was certainly a very droll accident,
<PB N="244" REF="243">Sophia, as could po&s;&s;ibly happen, yet nothing of the marvellous neither, as her hou&s;e is within a few miles of that to which I was going.</P>
<P>I am delighted to find, by my Aunt's letter, that wretch Morton is in a fair way of recovery, &s;ince ba&s;e as he has proved him&s;elf, I &s;hould have been &s;hocked be|yond expre&s;&s;ion to have been the cau&s;e of his death: &s;he tells me, when he is able to travel he is going abroad and of cour&s;e has no farther thoughts of per&s;ecuting me.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my dear Sophia, my troubles are really nearly over; not en|tirely, indeed, &s;ince I cannot be perfectly happy while my poor Father is thus go|verned by a tyrant, and not at liberty to &s;hew me that indulgence to which his heart inclines him; but he has &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to obey, without a murmur, that I tru&s;t he is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;|agreeable &s;ituation as I am.</P>
<P>Lady Stanley, &s;he al&s;o &s;ays, is flirting away, at a great rate, with Major Man|&s;ell, and &s;eems wholly to have forgotten the incon&s;tant Sommerville, and by the manner in which you find <HI>I</HI> &s;peak of him,
<PB N="245" REF="244">I hope you will &s;ee plainly all your kind fears are groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>No, no, Sophia! partial as I once was to him, believe me I am &s;o no longer; nor is it in nature he ever &s;hould regain that place in my e&s;teem he has &s;o ju&s;tly forfeited; be under no apprehen&s;ions therefore on that account, nor fear that I &s;hall find any difficulty in expelling his image from my brea&s;t; it is already done, Sophia, and were I even to &s;ee him again, which I &s;incerely wi&s;h I never may, be a&s;&s;ured it will be with all the indifference you can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. One may pity, but to love an unworthy object, knowing him to be &s;uch, mu&s;t, I think, be an im|po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I have not yet, Sophia, &s;aid half I ought to have done, in regard to my amiable friend; but hitherto I have had &s;o many other &s;ubjects which I wi&s;hed to acquaint you with, that &s;he mu&s;t, and I am con|vinced, would readily excu&s;e me, did &s;he know I had been guilty of this apparent neglect and ingratitude.</P>
<P>My dear Lady Mary, then, is about two and twenty, tall and elegantly formed; her face, tho' not perfectly beautiful, has
<PB N="246" REF="245">yet an un&s;peakable &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion, which many, who from having mere|ly a regularity of features are &s;tiled &s;o, have not: her eyes are particularly fine, her teeth uncommonly &s;o; in &s;hort, to me, &s;he is an exceeding fine woman; and for under&s;tanding, real wit, and vivacity, I have never met with her equal; add to this, &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of every fa&s;hionable accompli&s;hment, and has the mo&s;t melo|dious voice I ever heard in my life.</P>
<P>Such is the woman who&s;e hand Lord Sommerville declined accepting; or, ra|ther properly &s;peaking, declined paying his addre&s;&s;es to, for it is by no means clear he would have obtained it if he had: now it is mo&s;t certain, as &s;he tells me, her heart has long been engaged to another; to whom &s;he would ere now have been united, had &s;he not made a point of waiting a decent time to &s;ee how his Lord&s;hip would proceeed.</P>
<P>But, I will wait no longer, &s;aid &s;he, to me, ye&s;terday, as we were talking on the &s;ubject; my re&s;olution is unalterably fixed; I will now make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to know his; it is not u&s;ual for ladies to make the fir&s;t advances, nor &s;hould I in
<PB N="247" REF="246">any other circum&s;tances; I might no doubt marry without con&s;ulting him, but I feel a wicked plea&s;ure in the thoughts of the dilemma into which I &s;hall throw him, by de&s;iring his final determination.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Lady Mary, is it in na|nature he &s;hould one moment he&s;itate?</P>
<P>Oh! very po&s;&s;ible my dear! of that I think he has given me pretty convincing proofs, but thank my &s;tars, all men do not &s;ee with his eyes! I purpo&s;e writing to him, his an&s;wer will no doubt afford me &s;ome diver&s;ion; and not a little will he be amazed, as well as puzzled, when he has the felicity to receive my epi&s;tle; he no doubt flatters him&s;elf I &s;hall (in hopes &s;ome twenty years hence, he will relent and take me) live quietly a &s;pin&s;ter till that joyous hour arrives.&mdash;Woefully does he deceive him&s;elf, if he has any &s;uch ridiculous idea: In a few days I hope to pre&s;ent my intended <HI>caro &s;po&s;o</HI> to you Emily; you &s;hall then judge whe|ther it is po&s;&s;ible I am likely to be &s;uch a fool.</P>
<P>And now a word or two of her Lady|&s;hip's Aunt, Mrs. Selby, and I have done. There cannot be a more worthy, or more
<PB N="248" REF="247">agreeable woman, &s;he doats upon her charming niece, who has for many years been intirely under her care, is highly plea&s;ed with the object on whom &s;he has placed her affections, and is no le&s;s impa|tient than he is, to have the affair finally concluded; to me &s;he behaves in the kinde&s;t, the mo&s;t friendly manner; in|deed, my being a favourite of Lady Ma|ry's was quite &s;ufficient to in&s;ure me a gracious reception from her.</P>
<P>I have every rea&s;on to think her Lady|&s;hip has conceived a very &s;incere regard for me, the unhappy &s;ituation in which &s;he fir&s;t found me, greatly intere&s;ted her in my favour; and &s;ince &s;he has, as &s;he obligingly &s;ays, known me better, &s;he finds me worthy her tendere&s;t friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, and hopes our attachment will not only be mutual, but la&s;ting as our lives.&mdash;Nothing &s;he &s;miling, a&s;|&s;ured me, the other day, could po&s;&s;ibly weaken it on her &s;ide, except my robbing her a &s;econd time of her lover&mdash;as to Sommerville, I pardon you, Emily, &s;aid &s;he, but &s;hould you pre&s;ume to captivate Lord Neville, not all tho&s;e bewitching &s;miles &s;hall &s;ave you from the effects of my wrath and indignation.</P>

<PB N="250" REF="249">da&s;tardly enough to confe&s;s it, in hopes to &s;creen him&s;elf from farther vengeance; and this I think cannot be, as they have never met &s;ince the dam&s;el was re&s;cued by the valourous arm of Sommerville; who of cour&s;e, believes the &s;tory I wrote him, in the name of the hone&s;t hou&s;e|keeper.</P>
<P>She has now, as I &s;aid, made her e&s;cape from him too; but never! <HI>never</HI> will you gue&s;s by who&s;e means!&mdash;Only Lady Mary Craven! The very woman to whom he has for years been engaged to give his worthle&s;s hand!&mdash;True as you are alive! with her &s;he is at pre&s;ent, and there, I pray heaven &s;he may remain! For I could not &s;o far command my&s;elf, as to &s;ee her with patience; my only con&s;olation is, I have kept them all in a pretty decent bu&s;tle for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and, I think, put a final &s;top to her being Lady Sommerville.&mdash;Should he, after all, be fooli&s;h enough to think of &s;uch a thing&mdash;her gratitude to her bene|factre&s;s, to her new friend, mu&s;t be an un&s;urmountable bar to a Lady of her re|fined, romantic, &s;entiments; &s;o I have done with the whole &s;et, and &s;hall now find &s;ome other way to amu&s;e my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="250">Man&s;ell, ye&s;terday, while at dinner with me, received letters from London; one of them &s;eemed to give him particu|lar plea&s;ure; to tell you the truth, I fancied it might be from &s;ome favourite fair one; and jokingly told him my &s;u&s;|picions.</P>
<P>He kept me &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence, not a little flattered, I &s;uppo&s;e, at the &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y I had di&s;covered: at la&s;t, however, he gave it me to read, and I found it was actually from Som|merville, acquainting him, a friend of their's, the Duke de Saint Clair, whom they had both known in Paris, and from whom they had received a thou&s;and di&s;|tingui&s;hing marks of attention, was then in town, had vi&s;ited mo&s;t parts of the kingdom, and meant &s;oon to &s;et out on another tour. The rea&s;on of his writing, was to inform Man&s;ell, the Duke had made many obliging enquiries after him, and finding it would not be far out of his road, intended calling upon him, he therefore thought it not ami&s;s to give him notice of his Grace's de&s;ign, that he might be prepared to receive him, and to &s;hew him every thing worth no|tice in this part of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="251">And pray, what kind of mortal is this fame Duke? Young, or old? hand&s;ome, or a fright? rich, or poor?</P>
<P>Nay (laughing) half the&s;e que&s;tions at a time would be more than my memory could retain; pray begin again.</P>
<P>Pho! how horridly &s;tupid! Why old or young then? come try if you can an&s;wer me that?</P>
<P>Neither; about two or three and thirty, will that &s;uit you? ju&s;t my age!</P>
<P>Don't be impertinent, Man&s;ell! I care not a &s;traw though he were as old as&mdash;what do you call him? I give you my word.</P>
<P>Well, now to your next que&s;tion, let me &s;ee, what was it? O, <Q>hand&s;ome, or a fright.</Q>&mdash;Why to this too, I mu&s;t reply as before&mdash;neither!</P>
<P>Ah &s;hocking! I'll lay my life he is &s;ome queer figure, &s;ome aukward ill made animal, before I &s;ee him!</P>
<P>Now for the la&s;t, and not lea&s;t import|ant, "rich, or poor?"</P>
<P>Aye, as you &s;ay, that circum&s;tance may help to decide in regard to his other perfections, out with it!</P>
<P>Rich as a &s;ew then! immen&s;ely rich! and &s;prung from&mdash;</P>

<P>Well, what think you of him? (&s;mil|ing)</P>
<P>Oh, charming! Is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould not think him &s;o?</P>
<P>One que&s;tion your Lady&s;hip has quite forgot.</P>
<P>Pray what may that be? I know full as much about him already as I de&s;ire.</P>
<P>What no &s;park of curio&s;ity remaining, to be informed whether he has a heart and hand to be&s;tow?</P>
<P>Why what a jealous wretch thou art, Man&s;ell! No, po&s;itively then, I will not a&s;k any &s;uch matter, le&s;t I &s;hould hear of your dangling in your garters before to-morrow, and I do not want to be haunted by your gho&s;t; it is quite &s;ufficient that I am &s;o by your imper|tinent &s;elf!

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LADY Mary has received a polite an&s;wer from my Aunt, with her ready con&s;ent to my &s;taying as long as it is agreeable to her Lady&s;hip; adding, &s;he is highly flattered by her very obliging reque&s;t. She al&s;o, Sophia, writes in the kinde&s;t manner to me, &s;o that I really am now the happie&s;t creature imaginable; every thing I meet with here con&s;pires to make me &s;o, and to bani&s;h the hor|rid remembrance of pa&s;t &s;orrow from my recollection; the whole now appears like a frightful dream, and as &s;uch, I endeavour to drive it from my memory, on which it has neverthe&s;s made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion ever to be intirely era&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lord Neville arrived here a few days &s;ince, accompanied by a particular friend,
<PB N="256" REF="255">a Sir Henry Cardigan; the former is one of the fine&s;t figures I ever &s;aw, and his manner equally plea&s;ing, he &s;eems to adore Lady Mary, who is no le&s;s partial to him; one may hope, therefore, they will, though in high life, be a truly hap|py pair, which, I am afraid, is by no means a common ca&s;e in the fa&s;hionable circle.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip has wrote to Lord Som|merville.&mdash;I would give worlds you could have &s;een her letter, but it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to a&s;k a copy, nor could I do it ju&s;tice by attempting to repeat its con|tents; no other woman, I am per&s;uaded, could have acquitted her&s;elf &s;o well on &s;o aukward an occa&s;ion. Lord Neville is impatient for the an&s;wer, as on that depends his happy day.</P>
<P>She cannot forgive Lord Sommerville, for propo&s;ing to me a private marriage, &s;ince avarice could alone be his motive, no doubt he hoped thereby to evade the clau&s;e in his father's will, but had he entertained for me that regard &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay I merit, <HI>that</HI> circum&s;tance ought to have had no weight.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="256">Ah, Sophia! there is too much truth in her remark; I was a very, <HI>very</HI> weak creature, not to &s;ee his conduct in the &s;ame light I now do; perhaps there might be &s;ome little excu&s;e for me, young and inexperienced as I was; but my Aunt! Surely, Sophia, &s;he ought to have&mdash;Yet this is ungenerous! It is an ungrateful re|turn for her well meant compliance; &s;he could only have my happine&s;s in view, But let me drop the humbling, the morti|fying &s;ubject; never again &s;hall his dete&s;t|ed name &s;ully my paper, nor &s;hould I have mentioned him now, had it not been to tell you of the letter he has by this time received. Should he at la&s;t con&s;ent to ac|cept her Lady&s;hip's hand, (which I need hardly add &s;he has no thoughts of giving him) he will thereby prevent the lo&s;s of that money, on which it is plain he &s;ets &s;o great a value; if he declines it, it is her own, and as I told you before, &s;he purpo&s;es be&s;towing it on a more de&s;erv|ing object. Lord Neville, &s;o far from di&s;approving this generous de&s;ign, de|clares, if po&s;&s;ible, it rai&s;es her in his e&s;teem, and renders her more dear to him.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257">Thus, Sophia, we are on the point of having a wedding, at which I am to figure as bride's-maid, and the amiable Sir Henry, as my companion on the happy occa&s;ion; by the bye, I have not treated that gentleman well; I had nearly fini&s;h|ed my epi&s;tle without &s;aving one word about him, though were I to &s;ay all in his prai&s;e, they tell me he de&s;erves, I might fill another page or two. How true the eulogium I cannot judge on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance; all I can at pre&s;ent affirm is, that he is uncommonly engaging, and his per&s;on very elegant. He has been unfortunate, I hear, in a fir&s;t attachment, which has left a kind of melancholy on his &s;pirits, which intere&s;ts one &s;irangely in his favour. Lady Mary has &s;et me the ta&s;k of removing his dejection, &s;ays &s;he is otherwi&s;e employed, and therefore leaves him wholly to my care; adding, there is a &s;ort of &s;imilarity in our &s;ituations, and of cour&s;e I mu&s;t feel for him. How far they are &s;imilar, I know not, being yet a &s;tran|ger to the particulars of his; in my next I may, perhaps, be able to inform you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, now, my dear friend, bid you adieu&mdash;they &s;end for me. We are going

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. <HI>Lady Stanley to Mrs. Gro&s;venor.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Stanley Place.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Our formidable beau is arrived; and, would you believe it, after the account Man&s;ell gave me, is actually hand&s;ome? Much more &s;o than with his more impor|tant attractions was by any means nece&s;&s;a|ry. As for his Grace's under&s;tanding, that is neither here nor there; he is a Duke, Caroline; and, were he an idiot, I have too much &s;en&s;e my&s;elf to quarrel with him for that.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="259">It will not, I pre&s;ume, &s;urpri&s;e you much to hear, I, as u&s;ual, engro&s;s his whole attention; can I po&s;&s;ibly help it, if the fellows will be perver&s;e enough to prefer me to the mortified Colche&s;ter <HI>beiles?</HI> It was much the &s;ame ca&s;e in London; and I have accordingly been mo&s;t joyou&s;ly hated in both places.</P>
<P>Poor Man&s;ell, I believe, wi&s;hes him at the devil; and heartily repents introduc|ing him; but there's no help for that nei|ther. What would you think if I &s;hould, a &s;econd time, give up my liberty for the &s;ake of being <HI>Madame l&agrave; Duche&s;&s;e?</HI> Hea|vens! What a glorious triumph over Sommerville! Would it were in my of|fer! But I dare not expect it, for fear of a di&s;appointment; yet he is certainly &s;truck with me; nay, even Man&s;ell (though much again&s;t the grain) has a&s;&s;ured me he has been making a thou|&s;and enquiries&mdash;Says he never beheld &s;o fine a woman! So much of the ea&s;y, French vivacity&mdash;&s;o much wit&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;o many attractions, that he fears he &s;hall not be able to e&s;cape the fa&s;cinating pow|er of my charms.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">Much of this, Caroline, I mu&s;t &s;et down as Pari&s;ian gallantry. Yet, &s;aying it <HI>of</HI> me, is more flattering than <HI>to</HI> me&mdash;not that he is wanting in the latter, for his whole conver&s;ation is made up of compliments; he has &s;en&s;e enough, it is plain, to know his <HI>forte;</HI> he would not &s;hine much I believe on any other &s;ub|ject but that's a trifle, and you know "non&s;en&s;e is eloquence in, love."</P>
<P>We were la&s;t night at the a&s;&s;embly. Every eye was fixed upon us. I danced with him&mdash;to be &s;ure, he made no very brilliant figure on the occa&s;ion&mdash;well enough, however, for a Duke&mdash;a &s;tranger to our country dances too. By the bye I forget who it is that a&s;&s;erts for a fact that fools can never excel in that accompli&s;h|menth&mdash;Do not &s;et his Grace down on that li&s;t, neither, I be&s;eech you; not quite &s;o bad as that, though no Soloman!</P>
<P>This morning we had a party on hor&s;e|back; he was in raptures&mdash;&s;wore nothing could excel the elegance of my figure, the grace, the ea&s;e with which I managed the animal. It is a mercy I am &s;o perfect a mi&s;tre&s;s of the French language, or I &s;hould lo&s;e a thou&s;and flaming &s;peeches,
<PB N="262" REF="261">for he cannot expre&s;s him&s;elf well in Engli&s;h. I have promi&s;ed to teach him, on condition he will prolong his &s;tay, but he fears it will not be in his power, hav|ing promi&s;ed to meet a friend, who is to proceed with him in his intended tour.</P>
<P>This is rather again&s;t me, Caroline, to be &s;ure; and perhaps Man&s;ell too, may, out of revenge, (for he is jealous as the very devil) whi&s;per a few anecdotes in his ear, that may damp the ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion. This evening I am to have a concert and &s;upper at my own hou&s;e; there is no time to lo&s;e you &s;ee.</P>
<P>If I can &s;ucceed, Caroline, how I &s;hall enjoy the delightful thoughts of Sommer|ville's a&s;toni&s;hment. I vow this is my principal motive for wi&s;hing I could gain &s;o important a conque&s;t; he may then, perhaps, &s;ee the folly of prefering an in|&s;ignificant girl to me; be&s;ides, I die to &s;ee Paris&mdash;&s;ee it, to be &s;ure I may, whenever I plea&s;e; but to make my fir&s;t appear|ance there with &s;o much eclat, and &s;o much &s;plendour!</P>
<P>Adieu, I mu&s;t go and dre&s;s may all the graces lend me <HI>their</HI> aid on this occa&s;ion,

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE expected an&s;wer is arrived, So|phia; I may, perhaps, before I clo&s;e this, be able to get permi&s;&s;ion to take a copy of it, which you &s;hall have, in the mean time I will only tell you, Sommer|ville has &s;et her Lady&s;hip free:&mdash;in the mo&s;t graceful and delicate manner a thing of that nature was capable of, he has de|clined the honour of her hand.</P>
<P>Lord Neville has now prevailed upon his adored Lady Mary, to fix the day which is to make him (he &s;ays) the happie&s;t of
<PB N="264" REF="263">men, and I believe he &s;ays true; this day fortnight &s;he has agreed to give him her hand, in the mean time, preparations of every kind are going on with the ut|mo&s;t expedition, and all is joy and fe&s;ti|vity.</P>
<P>Even Sir Henry's &s;pirits are much more chearful than they were; this her Lady|&s;hip is plea&s;ed to attribute to me; but I cannot take the merit of it, Sophia, though I confe&s;s I have obeyed her in|junctions to the utmo&s;t, and he appears grateful for my attentions; I play to him, ling to him, and frequently walk with him before the re&s;t of the family are &s;tir|ring, for we are early ri&s;ers: his conver|&s;ation is highly entertaining; there is a &s;oftne&s;s a gentlene&s;s in his manners, which is extremely plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Do not be &s;illy now, Sophia, and infer from what I have &s;aid, a thou&s;and ridicu|lous things; I will at once convince you, you are mi&s;taken, by telling you the cau&s;e of that melancholy to which he has &s;o long been a prey, and you will confe&s;s there is little chance of his ever forming a &s;econd engagement with any of our &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="264">A young Lady of large fortune &s;aw him at Scarborough, about three years ago; &s;he fell de&s;perately in love with him, and tried every po&s;&s;ible means to at|tract his attention, but in vain; &s;he was not, it &s;eems, remarkably hand&s;ome, though agreeable, and highly accom|pli&s;hed: every one &s;aw the conque&s;t he had gained, and many wondered how he could re&s;i&s;t the temptation of &s;o great a fortune; that alone was none to him, his own was abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy his ambition. They met again in Lon|don: &s;till his behaviour was merely po|lite, and &s;uch as every woman of fa&s;hion is intitled to, from a man of breeding; &s;he was taken extremely ill&mdash;the doctors de|clared her in the utmo&s;t danger; nothing they could pre&s;cribe gave her the &s;malle&s;t relief: &s;he repeatedly &s;aid, &s;he wi&s;ned not to live, life was in&s;upportable to her, that &s;he looked for death as for her dear|e&s;t and only friend: this a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;hocked her doating mother:&mdash;in &s;hort, Sophia, &s;he at la&s;t confe&s;&s;ed, it was her hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion for Sir Henry which had reduced her to the condition in which &s;he then lay.&mdash;Mrs. John&s;tone in&s;tantly &s;ent
<PB N="266" REF="265">for him, and plainly told him her di&s;tre&s;s; that her daughter was infinitely dearer to her than life, be&s;ought him if his heart was not already engaged to another, to take pity on her loved Julia; her fortune was very con&s;iderable, her temper the mo&s;t amiable, her family and connections &s;uch as would do honour to any man.&mdash;The generous Cardigan was deeply af|fected, he had no attachment, and was per&s;uaded he could not but be happy, united to a woman who had given &s;uch &s;triking proofs of her partiality, though he felt for her no other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; the&s;e re|flections induced him to comply with her wi&s;hes, and tho&s;e of her de&s;pairing mo|ther. This information &s;oon re&s;tored her to health&mdash;in a &s;hort time they were married, and &s;he was the happie&s;t of wo|men; Sir Harry, too, perfectly &s;atisfied with his condition, from the plea&s;ing re|flection that he had, by the &s;acrifice he had made, rendered her &s;o.</P>
<P>Sophia! my dear Sophia! blu&s;hing for my &s;ex I write it! This very woman in le&s;s than a twelvemonth eloped with an En&s;ign in a marching regiment, fled
<PB N="267" REF="266">with him to France; &s;oon in her turn for|&s;aken by her worthle&s;s gallant, &s;he gave in to every kind of exce&s;s, and about a year and a half ago &s;he died an object of pity and wretchedne&s;s in Paris. I leave you to make your own reflections on this dreadful &s;tory, and &s;hall only add, you may now judge, if after having experi|enced &s;uch mi&s;ery in the married &s;tate, (though with &s;uch flattering pro&s;pects) it is likely he &s;hould ever venture to con|fide a &s;econd time in any of our &s;ex, or tru&s;t his honour, his &s;elicity, in their hands. No, no, Sophia, be a&s;&s;ured he never will. Adieu for the pre&s;ent&mdash;I will try what I can do to get the copy I mentioned.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>In continuation.</HEAD>
<P>WE are &s;o perpetually, and I may ju&s;t|ly add &s;o agreeably engaged, Sophia, that it has not till now been in my power to fini&s;h my letter, though it was begun &s;ome days &s;ince.&mdash;We have been to a ball, given by a family in this neighbour|hood, the company not very numerous, but, what is much more to my ta&s;te, in general plea&s;ing and agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="267">Sir Henry, before we &s;et out, a&s;ked for the honour of my hand&mdash;Lady Mary look|ed arch, and &s;miled; &s;he whi&s;pered &s;ome|thing, I know not what, though gue&s;&s;ed it was in con&s;equence of his reque&s;t; yet, &s;urely, nothing could be more natural; but the truth is, her Lady&s;hip pretends to fore&s;ee, what <HI>I</HI> prophe&s;y will never happen. Ah! Sophia, we have both &s;u&s;|fered too &s;everely already from the &s;ource at which &s;he hints. That he e&s;teems me, I have not a doubt; that he is plea&s;ed with the attention I pay him, and is grate|ful for it, I am exceedingly &s;en&s;ible; and who can &s;ee him and not &s;eel them&s;elves intere&s;ted in his happine&s;s&mdash;but what has all this to do with love?&mdash;Nothing! It would he hard, Sophia, it one could not &s;ee perfections in a man; nay, have a very &s;incere, a very tender friend&s;hip for him, without having al&s;o &s;entiments of that nature&mdash;I feel the attachment of a &s;i&s;ter for him, and am &s;ully per&s;uaded that of a brother is all he does, or ever will experience for your Emily.</P>
<P>What I now tell you is a fact, you may depend upon it; Lady Mary laughs at me when I talk to her on the &s;ubject,
<PB N="269" REF="268">and &s;ays, I am a &s;ly girl, and know more of the matter than I chu&s;e to con&s;e&s;s&mdash;in vain I declare the contrary&mdash;Sir Henry's cyes have let her into the whole &s;ecret, &s;he &s;ays, and &s;he daily expects his tongue will follow their example&mdash;As for you, Emily, cries &s;he, I take it for granted you have made a thou&s;and vows never again to tru&s;t the faithle&s;s &s;ex; it would, no doubt, be highly ridiculous having &s;ound <HI>one</HI> among&s;t them perfidious, and of cour&s;e poor Sir Henry <HI>can</HI> have nothing to ex|pect&mdash;is it not &s;o child?</P>
<P>Pretty nearly; and really Sir Henry mu&s;t have a greater portion of faith than a man ought to have; if he has not al&s;o made a few re&s;olutions on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My life for it he has (&s;aid her Lady&s;hip, laughing) but I'll take any bet, they are not &s;uch as you would per&s;uade me you imagine them to be. But here he comes, &s;o adieu; I leave you to &s;ettle the impor|tant point by your&s;elves&mdash;and away &s;he tripped, though I made &s;igns for her to &s;tay.</P>
<P>As he entered, I felt a blu&s;h on my cheeks; why, heavens knows! Since he certainly could not tell he had been the
<PB N="270" REF="269">&s;ubject of our conver&s;ation, at lea&s;t I hop|ed &s;o, though I had &s;oon rea&s;on to fear he had overheard part of it as he came in, by what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>And what is the important point we are to &s;ettle, (&s;aid he, tenderly taking my hand) if it is one in which I am any way concerned, I know no per&s;on on who&s;e judgment I could &s;o firmly depend as in that of the lovely Mi&s;s Herbert&mdash;what is the re&s;olution the charming Emily is &s;o po&s;itive I have formed.</P>
<P>Ah, replied I, &s;miling, though a good deal di&s;concerted, it is not, I may &s;afely &s;ay, that you will not be a li&s;tener, Sir Henry, but I will puni&s;h you by not grati|fying your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Then you mu&s;t permit me to gue&s;s again, (taking my hand) and if my con|jecture is right, I may venture to pro|nounce you are deceived, whatever re&s;o|lution I <HI>may</HI> have formed, I feel it will not long be in my power to keep it.</P>
<P>Here, Sophia, to my infinite &s;atisfac|tion our <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> was interrupted by the entrance of Lord Neville. I &s;lipped away and came up to fini&s;h this epi&s;|tle. Perhaps you will think the la&s;t page
<PB N="271" REF="270">contains more intere&s;ting matters than the fir&s;t.&mdash;I know not, Sophia, nor can I with certainty &s;ay, whether I wi&s;h what I have ju&s;t related, will bear the interpre|tation I well know <HI>you</HI> will put upon it; I will con&s;ider it more at lei&s;ure, and once more bid you adieu.</P>

I think I will, as I know it is not of the impertinent kind; know then that I begin to believe he &s;poke the truth, when he &s;aid, I was mi&s;taken in a certain conjecture I had formed: if he ever has vowed to revenge the injury he has received from one of our &s;ex by &s;lighting all the re&s;t; I &s;u&s;pect he begins to repent of his intended cru|elty, at lea&s;t he evidently makes your Emily an exception, for to her he devotes his whole time and mo&s;t plea&s;ing atten|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="273">And now let me ob&s;erve, it is either a mi&s;taken notion to affirm, we can only once in our lives experience a &s;erious at|tachment, or I certainly never yet did &s;o; and, when I compare my pre&s;ent &s;enti|ments with tho&s;e I felt for that wretched man who &s;o ill de&s;erved my partiality, I am of opinion I deceived my&s;elf, and that the terrors of being compelled to give my hand to one my heart abhorred, made me the more readily believe the other had made an impre&s;&s;ion on it: my Aunt, too, &s;o aver&s;e from the one match, and &s;o very anxious for the other.&mdash;In &s;hort, Sophia, I will be ingenuous; &s;hould the amiable Sir Henry really entertain any &s;uch de&s;ign, as Lady Mary, and in|deed I my&s;elf am rather of opinion he does, I feel it will not greatly di&s;plea&s;e me.&mdash;But am I hone&s;t, my dear Sophia, in &s;peaking thus coldly on the &s;ubject?

<PB N="279" REF="278">was flattered; this covered all his de|fects.&mdash;In &s;hort, he had not been here above a week when he made <HI>honourable</HI> propo&s;als; &s;he <HI>faintly</HI> objected to their &s;hort acquaintance&mdash;this ob&s;tacle he con|trived to remove.&mdash;She, now, as <HI>her friend</HI> con&s;ulted <HI>me</HI>; I replied, her Lady|&s;hip could alone judge of what was likely to make her happy&mdash;no doubt in point of rank and fortune, the offer was un|exceptionable, but I had hoped her heart was otherwi&s;e engaged&mdash;meaning to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pho! pho! (&s;carce able to conceal her joy) we have played the fool long enough, Man&s;ell, it is high time we &s;hould grow wi&s;e!</P>
<P>I acquie&s;ced; affecting, however, to put on a mortified look&mdash;the day was accordingly fixed, a licen&s;e obtained, and as I have already told you, I had actually the face to lead her to the altar and give her away.&mdash;His <HI>Grace</HI> was all rapture, and <HI>her Grace</HI> no le&s;s delighted I believe, though &s;he did not &s;o very plainly di&s;|cover her tran&s;port&mdash;I &s;pent the evening with the happy pair, and at a proper hour left them.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="279">How to de&s;cribe the next day's &s;cene is ab&s;olutely out of my power.&mdash;Indeed, you may &s;wear I did not think proper to be a witne&s;s; I had not courage or impudence for that, call it which you plea&s;e; but his <HI>Grace</HI>'s two &s;ervants&mdash;Alas! <HI>his</HI> no longer&mdash;gave me a few of the particulars. I had given them their in&s;tructions, and they implicitly followed them.</P>
<P>About one o'clock next morning they both went to her hou&s;e; and finding the happy couple were &s;itting mo&s;t &s;ociably togeter at breakfa&s;t, marched in with|out ceremony, and Richard being the be&s;t orator of the two, his hat in one hand, and &s;cratching his head with the other, &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e you have done with us now <HI>Moun&s;eer,</HI> and we may take back the carriage and hor&s;es to our ma&s;|ter; you know his Lord&s;hip &s;aid he could not lend them to you for above ten days or a fortnight, and you have had them almo&s;t twice that time already, not that I believe his honour will be an|gry, &s;eeing, as how, you have married &s;o fine a Lady.&mdash;I hope, however, be|fore we go, you will plea&s;e to give us
<PB N="281" REF="280">&s;omething to drink your's and madam's health.</P>
<P>Her Grace, a&s;toni&s;hed and enraged at their behaviour, (and believing they had drank too much already) was &s;till more &s;o on finding the <HI>Duke</HI> bore with &s;o much patience their unparalleled in&s;olence.</P>
<P>For heavens &s;ake! my dear Lord Duke, (ri&s;ing terrified from her &s;eat)&mdash;turn tho&s;e abominable wretches out of the room; how can you &s;uffer them to ap|proach you in that condition?</P>
<P>Why what offence pray? (returned Richard) we only came civilly to tell him we were going home with the car|riage to our ma&s;ter; he knows we ought to have been at home before now.</P>
<P>The fellow's mad, cried &s;he, almo&s;t frantic; for his <HI>Grace</HI> &s;till kept &s;ilent; who is your ma&s;ter? What Lord are you a talking of? Get out of my pre&s;ence this in&s;tant or I will order you both to be thrown out at the window.</P>
<P>What Lord! Why Lord Sommerville to be &s;ure! Mercy on us! has not <HI>Moun|&s;eer</HI> there told you all about it? I beg pardon if I have &s;aid any thing ami&s;s&mdash;I thought, for <HI>&s;artain,</HI> your Lady&s;hip
<PB N="282" REF="281">mu&s;t have known that you had married my Lord's <HI>Valee de Chamber.</HI> I am &s;ure, we all knew he came down here on pur|po&s;e, and borrowed the hor&s;es, carri|age, aye, and us too, to make a figure with.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth! What is it I hear? and, in&s;tantly overpowered by the &s;hock, fell lifele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>His <HI>Grace</HI> now rung for help, di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed the fellows, and what followed I know not, farther than that &s;he had &s;et off in a po&s;t chai&s;e and four early next morning, leaving him ma&s;ter of the premi&s;es; and as her lawful hu&s;band, I &s;hould imagine he has a right to enjoy all the profits ari&s;ing from them. I have not &s;een him &s;ince, having been obliged to go to Norwich on particular bu&s;ine&s;s that very day, where I &s;hall remain, pro|bably, a week or more; &s;o expect to hear from you before I return to the re|giment.</P>
<P>You may well believe the whole coun|try will be in a fine buz about her Lady|&s;hip's adventure, nor is there one &s;oul, I may venture to pronounce, who will not rejoice in her di&s;grace; the airs &s;he
<PB N="283" REF="282">gave her&s;elf, added to &s;ome other mat|ters, had rendered her odious to every mortal hereabouts, to the women parti|cularly; as for us fellows that is another affair.</P>
<P>Where &s;he will bend her cour&s;e, hea|ven knows! but I fancy &s;he will never figure in this part of the world again. Perhaps &s;he is gone to Paris, in order to look after his <HI>Grace's</HI> property there, while he conde&s;cends to &s;uperintend her's in England. Ignorant as he is of mo&s;t things, I'll lay my life he contrives to receive her rents, and to &s;pend them too; but all this is mere conjecture, for ought I know to the contrary he may by this time have gone after his bride.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume your Lord&s;hip cares as lit|tle about the matter as I do; we have done her bu&s;ine&s;s pretty effectually, and &s;he may now make the be&s;t &s;he can of her bargain. Perhaps Richard may have been able to give you &s;ome of the particu|lars I have related, more di&s;tinctly than I have done, he being a witne&s;s, nay, a principal in the <HI>denouement</HI> of the plot. Adieu, dear Sommerville. I hope you

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. <HI>Mi&s;s Herbert to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WELL, my dear, our wedding is over!&mdash;My friend, Lady Mary, is now the happy, the adored wife of her amiable Neville!&mdash;This is the fir&s;t lei&s;ure hour,
<PB N="285" REF="284">&s;ince the joyful event, I have been able to dedicate to my Sophia; nor have I time at pre&s;ent to write much, as we are to have half a hundred people to dine with us, and I am not yet dre&s;&s;ed; we have balls and concerts out of number, as will be the vi&s;its we &s;hall have to re|turn; but tho&s;e once over, I hope we &s;hall &s;ettle for a while, though not very long, I believe, as my Lord is impatient to conduct his lovely bride to his own &s;eat, where &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon it I mu&s;t accompany her. Her Aunt will remain here.</P>
<P>I have not yet given my an&s;wer, nor can I, till I hear from mine, which I expect to do every hour, having already wrote to her on the &s;ubject; my dear Father is out of the que&s;tion; he &s;eems to have given me quite up, but too well I know it does not proceed from want of tenderne&s;s&mdash;I hope a time will come in which I may receive, from his own lips, pardon for all the trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s I have given him.</P>
<P>Sir Henry&mdash;What of him? (cries my kind Sophia.)</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="285">Why, my dear, I think I may now venture to &s;ay, my company has in a great mea&s;ure made him forget his pa&s;t misfortunes;&mdash;he has in the mo&s;t engag|ing manner, a&s;&s;ured me, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hand, and heart, is alone want|ing to render him the happie&s;t of man|kind.</P>
<P>And what an&s;wer did I make? you a&s;k, Sophia.</P>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, could I believe this, and one moment he&s;itate? Impo&s;&s;i|ble! In my own mind I mean!&mdash;No nece&s;&s;ity for being quite &s;o ha&s;ty in ac|knowledging my real &s;entiments, though I fear he gue&s;&s;ed them!&mdash;In fine, he by &s;ome means or other obtained my per|mi&s;&s;ion to write to my Father. Lady Neville is almo&s;t as much delighted with the pro&s;pect of your Emily's felicity as &s;he was with her own.&mdash;The po&s;t this moment arrived&mdash;a letter for me&mdash;I mu&s;t lay down my pen till I read its contents.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>In continuation.</HEAD>
<P>Good heavens! Sophia, what a &s;tory is here? I am utterly confounded!
<PB N="287" REF="286">Amazed beyond all po&s;&s;ible conception.&mdash;It cannot be!&mdash;She is! &s;he &s;urely mu&s;t be mi&s;taken! Never &s;ince I was created did I hear &s;uch a hi&s;tory! No my dear, I &s;hall never &s;o far get the better of my un&s;peakable a&s;toni&s;hment as to be able to tell you.</P>
<P>Lady Stanley&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! I know not where to begin. The Duke I wrote to you about &s;ome time &s;ince, proves to be an impo&s;tor. This is not all.&mdash;Be|fore it was di&s;covered, he had actually married her: but what appears to me the mo&s;t inexplicable of the whole is, he is &s;aid to be valet to Lord Sommerville, and had borrowed his ma&s;ter's carriage, &s;ervants, &amp;c. &amp;c. to carry on the abomi|nable deception.</P>
<P>This part of the &s;tory I cannot po&s;&s;ibly give credit to&mdash;would &s;he not have known again both one and the other? Yet that's a &s;illy objection, &s;ince if it really is &s;o, he would no doubt take care to &s;end none &s;he had ever &s;een; but what in the name of wonder could induce <HI>him</HI> to have any hand in it? It is this I cannot fathom. What had &s;he done to de&s;erve &s;uch a pu|ni&s;hment from him? How had &s;he offend|ed?
<PB N="288" REF="287">I am perplexed! confounded! and know not what to make of it! My Aunt, too, is on the &s;pot, &s;o that there mu&s;t be &s;ome foundation for it one would think, were it not &s;o very improbable&mdash;Lady Neville calls me, I will return in a mo|ment.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is certainly a fact, Sophia, her Lady|&s;hip, and all my friends below, are in no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment than my&s;elf; they were reading the news papers and actually met with the &s;tory there, which was the occa|&s;ion of their &s;ending for me down; we are all now in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation, and would give worlds to know the whys and wherefores of the matter, for it is tho&s;e we can make nothing of.</P>
<P>Bad as his Lord&s;hip is, we can hardly conceive he could take part in &s;uch an in|famous tran&s;action unprovoked; and I never heard &s;he had given him any rea&s;on for re&s;entment. He had a pretence for his vile conduct to me, though &s;uch as no man of honour would have looked upon as a ju&s;tifiable one; he no doubt excu&s;es it to him&s;elf, by pleading the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, as tho&s;e libertine creatures all do I &s;uppo&s;e; but here we can find no
<PB N="289" REF="288">earthly cau&s;e for what he has done; if it is true that he actually is guilty, but this I &s;ay, bad as he is, I cannot believe&mdash;The fellow mu&s;t have made u&s;e of every thing without his knowledge: in &s;hort, the more I think of it the more I am be|wildered, &s;o I mu&s;t leave the affair as it was.</P>
<P>One thing I had almo&s;t forgot, and no wonder: her Lady&s;hip no &s;ooner found how &s;he had been deceived, than &s;he &s;et off in a po&s;t chai&s;e and four, nobody knows whither; taking only her woman and one man &s;ervant with her; <HI>his Grace</HI> is left ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion-hou&s;e;&mdash;how long he means to occupy it, or what he intends to do next, no &s;oul can gue&s;s.&mdash;Adieu. I have &s;cribbled till I have &s;carce left time to dre&s;s.</P>

<DATELINE>Colche&s;ter.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN ju&s;tice to Lord Sommerville, I take up my pen&mdash;A &s;tory you would probably hear of, in which his Lord&s;hip bears a con&s;iderable &s;hare, mu&s;t, to tho&s;e igno|rant of his motives, &s;et him in no very favourable point of view. I am far from ju&s;tifying his conduct in regard to Mi&s;s Herber: it will admit of no apology; no one can more &s;everely condemn it than my&s;elf; every man of honour, of delicacy, mu&s;t hold it unpardonable; forgive me, madam, for pre&s;uming to recall circum&s;tances to your remembrance which mu&s;t be painful; all I mean is to lay open a &s;cene of treachery practi&s;ed
<PB N="291" REF="290">but too &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t him by the mo&s;t artful of women, which I hope will convince you he is not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o culpable as you have hitherto had but too much cau&s;e to believe him; and al&s;o excu&s;e the revenge he has taken on his greate&s;t enemy; an enemy who has for ever de|&s;troyed his peace of mind, and every po&s;|&s;ibility of happine&s;s.&mdash;That happine&s;s wholly depended on the amiable Mi&s;s Herbert's e&s;teem, and he has for ever lo&s;t it; he knows, he confe&s;&s;es the ju&s;tice of her re&s;entment, and though rendered the mo&s;t wretched of men, &s;ubmits, with re|&s;ignation, to the puni&s;hment inflicted on him.</P>
<P>Know then Mi&s;s Herbert, that woman is no other than Lady Stanley. It was my&s;elf who made the di&s;covery of her ba&s;ene&s;s. Envious of your virtue and &s;uperior attractions, &s;he wi&s;hed to reduce you to her own level. But heaven! ever watchful over the innocent, pre&s;erved you from the &s;nares &s;he had laid, and &s;he now &s;uffers very &s;everely for her crimes.</P>
<P>She it was, madam, who, by her arts, per&s;uaded Mr. Morton to carry you off from Lord Sommerville, for whom &s;he had then as warm an attachment as a
<PB N="292" REF="291">a mind depraved as her's is capable of: her motive was not only to revenge her|&s;elf on you for robbing her of his affecti|ons, but &s;he al&s;o hoped to regain them when he found you were lo&s;t to him for ever. In this (as well &s;he might) &s;he was deceived. Mi&s;s Herbert's charms had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion to be &s;o ea|&s;ily effaced.</P>
<P>More enraged than ever, &s;he next forged a letter as from a &s;ervant at Mr. Morton's, while you were confined in his hou&s;e, which &s;he &s;ent to his Lord|&s;hip, telling him you were there, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;incere &s;orrow for the in&s;ults and brutal treatment you had re|ceived from her vile ma&s;ter. In &s;hort, to &s;pare your delicacy the &s;hock of hear|ing more of its horrid contents, imagine, if you plea&s;e, the wor&s;t &s;o wicked a wo|man could invent.</P>
<P>Lord Sommerville, enraged and di&s;|tracted with this intelligence, having no &s;u&s;picion of the fraud, and believing the infamous &s;tory, in&s;tantly &s;et off for the place of your confinement, and re&s;cued you, as you know, from the power of the man who forcibly detained you.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="292">I wi&s;h I could as fully ju&s;tify his Lord|&s;hip in what followed, as I tru&s;t I have thus far!&mdash;but I attempt it not! It is impo&s;|&s;ible! He is deeply &s;en&s;ible of it him&s;elf. The puni&s;hment he has inflicted on the worthle&s;s Lady Stanley, I need not relate. Mrs. Grenville has no doubt given you the particulars! but it was only in my power, or that of his Lord&s;hip, to explain his rea&s;on for arrogating to him&s;elf that prerogative, and he would not pre&s;ume to take &s;o great a liberty, I am fully per|&s;uaded; give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you upon my honour, he is even ignorant of my having done it.</P>
<P>Faulty, nay unpardonably &s;o as he has undoubtedly been, I yet cannot but pity him from my &s;oul, when I con&s;ider the ine&s;timable trea&s;ure he has lo&s;t, in lo&s;ing the lovely, the amiable Mi&s;s Herbert. Ah! <HI>He</HI> too, is indeed &s;ufficiently puni&s;h|ed&mdash;Pardon my engro&s;&s;ing &s;o much of your time, and believe me, with the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem and re&s;pect, madam,</P>

<P>WELL, my dear Sophia!&mdash;our curi|o&s;ity you find is at length fully gratified&mdash;What think you of the artful! The horrid Lady Stanley! Your a&s;toni&s;hment, no doubt, equalled mine, &s;urpa&s;s it, it could not.&mdash;Was there ever, do you think, another &s;o complete a wretch in female form? I would gladly hope not.</P>
<P>The amiable Sir Henry was much alarmed on reading the Major's letter; I &s;aw his colour change as he peru&s;ed it, and his eyes frequently turned on me&mdash;was it po&s;&s;ible he could really for a mo|ment fear my re&s;entment was over, be|cau&s;e his friend had proved he was not quite &s;o great a villain as I had believed him?&mdash;Or rather made an attempt to prove it, for in fact, I do not find him much le&s;s &s;o than he was before; her Lady&s;hip being &s;o very vile a creature does not excu&s;e him; whatever he might, by her arts, be per&s;uaded to believe, it is impo&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify him&mdash;nay, I think
<PB N="295" REF="294">his ba&s;e, his ungenerous behaviour to me afterward was infinitely the more unpar|donable.&mdash;Was he not, Sophia, the mo&s;t abandoned of mankind! Could he, be|cau&s;e he believed me &s;o cruelly injured by another, have wi&s;hed to render me &s;till more mi&s;erable?&mdash;Ah! No, no!&mdash;None but a libertine, like him&s;elf, could have been capable of forming &s;o execra|ble a de&s;ign&mdash;Well may he de&s;pair of re|gaining my e&s;teem&mdash;heaven forbid I &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of honour and delicacy, as to be able to be&s;low it on &s;o unworthy an object.</P>
<P>Lady Mary, as well as my&s;elf, ob&s;erv|ed Sir Henry's emotions.</P>
<P>Ah, (cried &s;he &s;miling) poor Sir Henry has now no chance; he may even take refuge on the neare&s;t friendly willow he can meet with; to be &s;ure our Emily cannot be &s;o cruel as to refu&s;e her pardon to his Lord&s;hip; you &s;ee he is not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o black as his friend would per&s;uade us, and we fooli&s;hly believed him; &s;he is too good a Chri&s;tian, I hope, not to forget and forgive, be&s;ides, you find he repents mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Ah, Lady Neville, &s;pare your raillery, do not torture me by.&hellip;</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="295">Nay, Sir Henry (interrupting him) I I be&s;eech you <HI>&s;pare me,</HI> you &s;urely pay me a wretched compliment, while you &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible I can ever feel any &s;entiments but tho&s;e of horror and con|tempt for &s;o worthle&s;s a being&mdash;could I ever look upon him in a more favourable light I &s;hould little merit that friend&s;hip and e&s;teem with which you honour me.&mdash;I believe, Sophia, I looked rather grave.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf at my feet and (re|&s;pectfully taking my hand) cried, never, my adorable Emily, will I re&s;e from this humble po&s;ture till you have &s;miled for|givene&s;s! I ought, indeed, to have known my angel better! I blu&s;h for my folly, but a true pa&s;&s;ion is ever apprehen|&s;ive; only &s;ay you pardon me, and tell me I have not wholly forfeited!</P>
<P>Come, come, Emily! put the creature out of his mi&s;ery. I am too happy my|&s;elf not to wi&s;h every mortal equally &s;o (looking on her amiable hu&s;band, who &s;eized her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it with fer|vour to his lips.) Come, &s;ay &s;omething civil, and &s;et his &s;imple heart at re&s;t!</P>
<P>It mu&s;t then be on condition Sir Henry does me more ju&s;tice for the future than
<PB N="297" REF="296">to believe I can ever be &s;o blind to my own felicity as to prefer <HI>any</HI> man to him, much le&s;s the worthle&s;s one who has cau&s;ed his pre&s;ent perplexity.</P>
<P>He flung his arms tenderly round me, and before I could po&s;&s;ibly di&s;engage my|&s;elf, pre&s;&s;ed me to his brea&s;t, with looks which plainly &s;poke his gratitude.</P>
<P>That's a good girl! You have really made me a hand&s;ome &s;peech, con&s;idering it was extempore, and &s;ince we are all friends again, &s;uppo&s;e I make a propo&s;al, which I think will contribute not a little to keep us &s;o.</P>
<P>Oh by all means, (not dreaming what it was to be) I give you my word there is nothing I de&s;ire more.</P>
<P>Well then, Emily, &s;uppo&s;e!&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e now you were to do the <HI>very</HI> genteel thing! and tell us, you will, before the end of this week&mdash;let me &s;ee&mdash;this is Wedne&s;day&mdash;aye ju&s;t &s;o&mdash;before the end of this week give your hand to&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Lady Neville, (endea|vouring to interrupt her) how can you be &s;o very &s;illy?&mdash;I felt my face in a glow, Sophia! and &s;topped.</P>
<P>Sir Henry flew to her, (joy &s;parkling in his intelligent countenance) thus, on
<PB N="298" REF="297">my knees, let me thank my kind, my good friend, for her generous interpo&s;i|tion! Then ri&s;ing, and taking my hand, can my lovely Emily refu&s;e to oblige the amiable Lady Neville? Say my deare&s;t creature, you will comply with her re|que&s;t, and make me the happie&s;t of&mdash;</P>
<P>Stop, I be&s;eech you, Sir Henry; po&s;i|tively, I will not be &s;o taken in: her La|dy&s;hip is very &s;ly; how could I evr ima|gine this was her fine propo&s;al? If I had, can you believe I &s;hould &s;o readily have agreed to hear it?</P>
<P>Oh! not for the world, to be &s;ure, laughing at my fooli&s;h attempt to ju&s;tify my&s;elf (and, to &s;ay truth, Sophia, it was &s;ufficiently &s;o; but I was horridly di&s;concerted) who could ever have fan|cied &s;uch a wicked thing? But now, having &s;o clearly acquitted your&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of all whom it may con|cern, &s;uppo&s;e, as I was &s;aying, you &s;hould name to-morrow.</P>

<P>And pray Mi&s;s Herbert! But we will not differ about trifles; &s;o, to end all di&s;|putes, let it be Saturday.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="298">In &s;hort, Sophia, by &s;ome means or other, &s;he actually carried her point; and, on Saturday next! Ble&s;s me, my dear friend, what am I to do? No pre|parations made! Mercy on me! I had a thou&s;and things to think of! A thou&s;and things to &s;ettle!&mdash;She &s;ays all that will be an amu&s;ement hereafter&mdash;it is &s;o in the common &s;tyle, to lay in a &s;tock of fine|ry, as if a girl was afraid when once mar|ried &s;he &s;hould never get another new gown again as long as &s;he lived.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, Sir Henry has received mo&s;t gracious an&s;wers both from my Father and Aunt. I wi&s;hed much to have had them both pre&s;ent at the ce|remony; but the former (had there been no other impediment) is at this time laid up with the gout; and, as for the latter, Lady Neville je&s;tingly &s;ays, one old fidget|ing Aunt is enough at a time, and &s;he will lend me hers&mdash;the truth of the mat|ter is, Mrs. Grenville earne&s;tly begged to be excu&s;ed, but is extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after|wards.</P>
<P>So the important affair was &s;ettled this very morning&mdash;Wedne&s;day&mdash;Thur&s;day Friday&mdash;only three days&mdash;Good heaven!
<PB N="300" REF="299">my dear, Sophia, is it actually po&s;&s;ible? Sir Henry a&s;&s;ured me of it not an hour ago; and can I <HI>now,</HI> for the fir&s;t time, begin to doubt his veracity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI. <HI>Lady Neville to Mi&s;s Fermer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUR friend, Emily, was on the point of taking up her pen to tell you &s;he was married la&s;t Saturday. I happened to pop into her room at the very in&s;tant, and fore&s;eeing &s;he would make but a poor hand of it, with her tremors, trepidations, and &s;o forth, took it quietly from her, &s;ent her down to her Sir Henry, re&s;olv|ed to acquaint you with it my&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to my being quite a &s;tranger to Mi&s;s Fermer, that ob&s;tacle, we flatter our|&s;elves, will &s;oon be removed, as we hope to call in upon you in the tour we are going to make, and by that means I &s;hall be &s;o no longer; in the mean time you
<PB N="301" REF="300">mu&s;t fancy the vi&s;it over, and it is per|fectly the &s;ame thing&mdash;Do you compre|hend me?</P>
<P>Well, and &s;o on Saturday, as I was &s;aying, the dear girl was married!&mdash;Some folks now, who have happier ta|lents, would fill half a dozen pages hav|ing &s;uch a theme; but I &s;ee nothing wonderful in it&mdash;She &s;o lovely! He &s;o di&s;cerning!&mdash;</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we are ready we &s;hall &s;et off for her father's; it is proper I, under who&s;e roof this affair has been tran&s;act|ed, &s;hould pre&s;ent Sir Henry, you know, le&s;t they &s;hould accu&s;e him of running away with her without my leave.</P>
<P>Then away we march to &s;how him to her Aunt&mdash;next to you; but you, (pray ob&s;erve) are to pack up your very be&s;t bib and tucker, as we mean to take you with us, &s;o pray don't fail to be ready.</P>
<P>When we leave our Aunt, we proceed to my Lord's &s;eat, &s;tay there till I have looked about me a little; &s;et matters to rights, as a notable wife ought to do, find a thou&s;and fauts, turn off half a &s;core of his favourite dome&s;tics, &amp;c. &amp;c. to &s;how I know who is mi&s;tre&s;s, and that he has not married a raw ignorant girl.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="301">Well, after that Sir Henry takes us all to <HI>his Chateau,</HI> trembling no doubt for the example I have &s;et his gentle Emily; when &s;he has, in her turn, played the wife there for a few days, we whi&s;k up to London and buy finery; of cour&s;e are pre&s;ented, &s;how our&s;elves at every public place, meet with univer&s;al admi|ration; and then return to the country; where, having compo&s;ed our features into a proper degree of gravity, we commence wives in &s;ober downright earne&s;t.</P>
<P>That very amiable creature, Lady Stanley, <HI>alias</HI> Madame la Duche&s;&s;e, has wi&s;ely taken her&s;elf out of the kingdom, &s;ome &s;ay to France; and his <HI>Grace</HI> having con&s;ulted a lawyer, and finding he is, <HI>bona fida,</HI> lord and ma&s;ter of all &s;he has left behind her, makes him&s;elf ea&s;y, and is re&s;olved &s;he &s;hall &s;eek him before he goes in que&s;t of her. How they will end their days, the deponent &s;aith not.</P>
<P>There child! there is all the news I am mi&s;tre&s;s of. Don't forget the part I have a&s;&s;igned you, and believe me,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVII. <HI>Lord Sommerville to Charles Dalton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dover.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CHARLES, I have actually &s;een her!&mdash;&s;een my enchanting, my &s;till ador|ed Emily!&mdash;Seen her the wi&s;e of ano|ther, and yet I live!</P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite box, at the playhou&s;e, I beheld the lovely creature, infinitely more &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, than ever&mdash;I had heard of her being married only a few days before; but, for the care and watchful attention of Sedly, who was with me when I was informed of it, and who has never quitted me &s;ince, I &s;hould certainly have &s;hot my&s;elf through the head!&mdash;I was mad! Di&s;tracted! and I have him to thank for not being guilty of &s;ome de&s;perate action.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw her, he forcibly held me, for I was ab&s;urd enough to attempt fly|ing to her.&mdash;Happily he made me quit the hou&s;e&mdash;happily, I &s;ay, for with con|fu&s;ion I write, I have injured the dear angel too much already ever to wi&s;h to di&s;tre&s;s her farther.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="303">I returned home in an agony, that I think would even have excited pity in her dear brea&s;t; ordered my things to be packed up, late as it was, and actually &s;et out that night for Dover, from whence I write the&s;e lines while waiting for the packet.</P>
<P>Never! never more! will I &s;ubject my&s;elf to the inexpre&s;&s;ible torment of &s;eeing her again, but will quit England for ever, that I may not run that ha|zard.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Dalton, for the la&s;t time while re&s;ident in my native land, do I bid you adieu, and am your unhappy, but &s;incere friend.</P>
