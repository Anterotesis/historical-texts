<HEAD>A DIALOGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES STOCK and his journeyman Will Simp|&s;on, as I informed my Readers in the Second Part of the Two Shoemakers, had re&s;olved to work together one hour every evening in order to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for Tommy Williams's &s;chooling. This circum|&s;tance brought them to be a good deal together when the re&s;t of the men were gone home. Now it happened that Mr. Stock had a mighty way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> endeavouring to turn all common events to &s;ome u&s;e; and he thought it right on the pre&s;ent occa+&s;ion to make the only return in his power to Will Simp&s;on for his great kindne&s;s. "For," &s;aid he "if Will gives up &s;o much of his time to hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me to provide for this poor boy, it is the lea&s;t can do to try to turn part of that time to the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+po&s;e of promoting Will's &s;piritual good." No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as the bent of Stock's own mind was religious, was ea&s;y to him to lead their talk to &s;omethin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> profitable. He always took e&s;pecial care how+ever, that the &s;ubject &s;hould be introduced pro+perly, cheerfully, and without con&s;traint. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="3" REF="3">well knew that great good may be &s;ometimes done by a prudent attention in &s;eizing proper opportu|nities, &s;o he knew that the cau&s;e of piety had been &s;ometimes hurt by forcing &s;erious &s;ubjects where here was clearly no di&s;po&s;ition to receive them. &s;ay he had found out that two things were nece&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary to the promoting of Religion among his friends; warm zeal to be always on the watch for occa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, and a cool judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h which vas the right time and place to make u&s;e of them. To know <HI>how</HI> to do good is a great matter, but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">now <HI>when</HI> to do it is no &s;mall one.</P>
<P>Simp&s;on was an hone&s;t good-natured fellow; he was now become &s;ober, and rather religiou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed. But he was ignorant, he did not know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch of the grounds of Religion, or of the cor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uption of his own nature; he was regular at Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut was fir&s;t drawn thither rather by his &s;kill in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;alm-&s;inging than by any great devotion. He had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eft off going to the Greyhound, and often read the Bible or &s;ome other good book on the Sunday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vening. This he thought was quite enough; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hought the Bible was the prettie&s;t hi&s;tory book in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he world, and that Religion was a very good thing or Sundays. But he did not much under&s;tand what bu&s;ine&s;s people had with it on working days. He had left off drinking becau&s;e it had brought Williams to the grave, and his wi&s;e to dirt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ags; but not becau&s;e he him&s;elf had &s;een the evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f &s;in. He now con&s;idered &s;wearing and Sabbath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reaking as &s;candalous and indecent, but he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot found out that both were to be left off becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey are highly offen&s;ive to GOD, and grieve his Holy Spirit. As Simp&s;on was le&s;s &s;elf-conceited
<PB N="4" REF="4">than mo&s;t ignorant people are, Stock had alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a good hope that when he &s;hould come to be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ter acquainted with the word of GOD, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the evil of his own heart, he would become o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> day a good Chri&s;tian. The great hindrance w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that he fancied him&s;elf &s;o already.</P>
<P>One evening Simp&s;on had been calling to Stock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mind how di&s;orderly the hou&s;e and &s;hop, when they were now &s;itting quietly at work, had for|merly been, and he went on thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comfortably we live now ma&s;ter to what we u&s;ed to do in Williams's time! I u&s;ed then never to be happy but when we were keep+ing it up all night, but now I am as merry as the day is long. I find I am twice as happy &s;ince I am grown good and &s;ober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you are happy, Will, and I re|joice that you are &s;ober; but I would not have yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> take too much pride in your own goodne&s;s for fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;hould become a &s;in, almo&s;t as great as &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e you have left off.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not good ma&s;ter! why don't you find me regular and orderly at work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much &s;o, and accordingly I have a great re&s;pect for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pay every one his own, &s;eldom mi&s;s Church, have not been drunk &s;ince Williams died have hand&s;ome cloaths for Sundays, and &s;ave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trifle every week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. And to all this you may add that you very generou&s;ly work an hour, for poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tommy's education, every evening without fee o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reward.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well ma&s;ter, what can a man do more&punc;
<PB N="5" REF="5"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f all this is not being good, I don't know what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the&s;e things are very right as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey go, and you could not well be a Chri&s;tian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ithout doing them. But I &s;hall make you &s;tare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erhaps when I tell you, you may do all the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings and many more, and yet be no Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Chri&s;tian! &s;urely ma&s;ter I do hope that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter all I have done, you will not be &s;o unkind as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay I am no Chri&s;tian?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOD forbid that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o Will. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope better things of you. But come now, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o you think it is to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! why to be chri&s;tened when one is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hild, to learn the Catechi&s;m when one can read, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be confirmed when one is a youth, and to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Church when one is a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are all very proper things, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ite nece&s;&s;ary. They make a part of a Chri&s;tian's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e. But for all that, a man may be exact in them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, and yet not be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not be a Chri&s;tian! ha! ha! ha! you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery comical ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, I am very &s;erious, Will. At is rate it would be a very ea&s;y thing to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hri&s;tian, and every man who went through certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rms would be a good man; and one man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;erved the&s;e forms would be as good as another. Whereas, if we come to examine our&s;elves by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord of GOD, I am afraid there are but few com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ratively whom our Saviour would allow to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Chri&s;tians. What is your notion of a Chri&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an's practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he mu&s;t not rob nor murder, nor
<PB N="6" REF="6">get drunk. He mu&s;t avoid &s;candalous things, and do as other decent orderly people do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is ea&s;y enough to be what the world calls a Chri&s;tian, but not to be what the Bible calls &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ma&s;ter, we working men are not ex|pected to be &s;aints, and martyrs, and apo&s;tles, and mini&s;ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not. And yet Will, there ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not two &s;orts of Chri&s;tianity; we are called to prac+ti&s;e the &s;ame Religion which they practi&s;ed, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;omething of the &s;ame &s;pirit is expected in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which we reverence in them.

We are called to "be holy" in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mea&s;ure and degree, "as he who hath called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is holy." It was not only &s;aints and martyrs w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> were told that they mu&s;t be "like-minded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t"&mdash;That "they mu&s;t do all to the glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God"&mdash;That they mu&s;t renounce the &s;pirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> world, and deny them&s;elves."

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this might be very proper for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be taught, becau&s;e they had not been bred
<PB N="7" REF="7">Chri&s;tians, but Heathens or Jews: and Chri&s;t wanted to make them his followers, that is, Chri&s;|tians.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then you fancy that Chri&s;tianity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omes to people in a Chri&s;tian country by nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it comes by a good education or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good example. When a fellow who has got any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;e &s;ees a man cut off in his prime by drinking, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think he will begin to leave it off.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will, What you &s;ay is the truth, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is not the whole truth. You are right as far as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, but you do not go far enough.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, ma&s;ter, to &s;peak the truth, if I go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Church on Sundays, and follow my work in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e week, I mu&s;t &s;ay I think that is being good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, that he who does both
<PB N="8" REF="8">gives the be&s;t outward &s;igns that he is good. But our going to Church, and even reading the Bible, are no proofs that we are as good as we need be, but rather that we do both the&s;e in order to make us better than we are. We do both on Sundays, as means by God's ble&s;&s;ing to make us better all the week. We are to bring the fruits of that Chapter or of that Sermon into our daily life, and try to get our inmo&s;t heart and &s;ecret thoughts, as well as our daily conduct, amended by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;ure ma&s;ter, you won't be &s;o un|rea&s;onable as to want a body to be religious always? I can't do that neither. I'm not &s;uch a hypocrite as to pretend to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you can in every action of your life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What ma&s;ter, always to be thinking about Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, far from it Will; much le&s;s to be always talking about it. But you mu&s;t be always acting under it's power and &s;pirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;urely 'tis pretty well if I do this when I go to Church; or while I am &s;aying my prayers. Even you ma&s;ter, as &s;trict as you are, would not have me always on my knees, nor always at Church I &s;uppo&s;e: for then how would your work be carried on, and how would our town be &s;upplied with &s;hoes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Will. 'Twould be no proof of our Religion to let our cu&s;tomers go barefoot; but 'twould be a proof of our lazine&s;s, and we &s;hould &s;tarve as we ought to do. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the world mu&s;t not only be carried on, but carried on with &s;pirit and activity. We have the &s;ame authority for not being "&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s as we have for being fervent in &s;pirit." Religion has
<PB N="9" REF="9"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut Godline&s;s and lazine&s;s as wide a&s;under as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wo things in the world; and what God has &s;epa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated, let no man pretend to join. Indeed, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit of religion can have no fellow&s;hip with &s;loth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dolence, and &s;elf-indulgence. But &s;till, a Chri&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an does not carry on his common trade quite like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nother man neither. For &s;omething of the &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich he labours to attain at Church, he carries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith him into his worldly concerns.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ma&s;ter, I do think, if God Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> contented with one day in &s;even, he won't thank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou for throwing him the other &s;ix into the bargain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thought he gave us them for our own u&s;e; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m &s;ure nobody works harder all the week than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou do.</P>

<P>Yes, ju&s;t as you do when you make Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gion a thing for the Church and not for the world.

<P>Aye, indeed&mdash;how can that be? Now you're too much on t'other &s;ide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e a man's trials in trade being often greater, they give him fre&s;h means of glorifying God, and proving the &s;incerity of his religion. A man, who mixes in bu&s;ine&s;s, is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties. The&s;e will lead him, if he be a good man, to look more to GOD, than he perhaps would otherwi&s;e do. He &s;ees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are &s;nares all around him, this makes him watchful; he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him, this makes him humble him&s;elf; while a &s;en&s;e of his own difficulties make him tender to the failings of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you would make one believe, after all, that trade and bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;inful in it&s;elf &s;ince it brings a man into all the&s;e &s;nares and &s;crapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Will; trade and bu&s;ine&s;s don't create evil pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;they were in the heart before &mdash;Only now and then they &s;eem to lie &s;nug a little|our concerns with the world bring them out into ac|tion a little more, and thus &s;hew both others and our&s;elves what we really are. But then, as the world offers more trials on the one hand, &s;o on the other it holds out more duties. If we are called to battle oftener, we have more opportunities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> victory. Every temptation re&s;i&s;ted, is an enemy &s;ubdued; and he that ruleth his own &s;pirit, is better than he that taketh a city.</P>

<P>Well, I &s;ay fir&s;t one, then the other; now for labour, now for religion.</P>

<P>I will &s;hew that both mu&s;t go together. I will &s;uppo&s;e you were going to buy &s;o many &s;kins of our currier&mdash;that is quite a worldly tran&s;action &mdash;you can't &s;ee what a &s;pirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves' &s;kins. Now, I tell you
<PB N="12" REF="12">it has a great deal to do with it. Covetou&s;ne&s;s, a de&s;ire to make a good bargain, may ri&s;e up in your heart. Selfi&s;hne&s;s, a &s;pirit of monopoly, a wi&s;h to get all, in order to di&s;tre&s;s others; the&s;e are evil de&s;ires, and mu&s;t be &s;ubdued. Some opportunity of unfair gain offers, in which there may be much &s;in, and yet little &s;candal. Here a Chri&s;tian will &s;top &s;hort; he will recollect, that "he who maketh ha&s;te to be rich &s;hall hardly be innocent." Per|haps the &s;in may be on the &s;ide of your dealer&mdash;<HI>be</HI> may want to overreach <HI>you</HI>&mdash;this is provoking&mdash;you are tempted to violent anger, perhaps to &s;wear&mdash; Here is a fre&s;h demand on you for a &s;pirit of pa|tience and moderation, as there was before for a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and &s;elf-denial. If, by God's grace, you get the victory over the&s;e temptations, you are the better man for having been called out to them. Always provided, that the temptation be not of your own &s;eeking. If you give way, and &s;ink un|der the&s;e temptations, don't go and &s;ay that trade and bu&s;ine&s;s have made you covetous, pa&s;&s;ionate, and pro&s;ane. No, no; depend upon it, you were &s;o before; you would have had all the&s;e evil &s;eeds lurking in your heart, if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing, with the addi|tional &s;in of idlene&s;s into the bargain. When you are bu&s;y, the devil often tempts you; when you are idle, you tempt the devil. If bu&s;ine&s;s and the world call the&s;e evil tempers into action, bu&s;ine&s;s and the world call that Religion into action too which teaches us to re&s;i&s;t them. And in this you &s;ee the Week-day fruit of the Sunday's piety. 'Tis trade and bu&s;ine&s;s in the Week which call us to put our Sunday readings, praying, and Church, going into practice.</P>
