<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Preface to my ESSAY <HI>on the Nature and Choice of Aliment,</HI> I promi&s;ed to treat the other <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> Air, Re&s;t, and Motion, after the &s;ame manner. I now choo&s;e to perform my Task imperfectly, rather than break my Word.</P>
<P><HI>Air</HI> is the next in Order, which, reflecting what a Share it has in all Animal Operations, I am of Opinion, has not been as yet &s;uf|ficiently
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
con&s;ider'd as to the Phy|&s;iology of its Effects: Philo&s;ophers, Mathematicians, Chymi&s;ts, the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Agriculture and Garden|ing, have attended to the Effects of Air on the Subjects of their &s;everal Arts, more than the Phy|&s;icians. The Rea&s;on of which Neg|lect may be, that Air is one of tho&s;e <HI>Inge&s;ta,</HI> or things taken in|wardly, which neither can be for|born nor mea&s;ur'd in Do&s;es: But the U&s;e of Air being unavoidable, is no Rea&s;on again&s;t inquiring in|to its Effects; be&s;ides, it is incum|bent upon the Profe&s;&s;ors of our Art to know and a&s;&s;ign, as far as they can, the true Cau&s;es of the Changes which happen in Hu|man Bodies; and there are many more u&s;ele&s;s Inquiries than this, about the Effects of Air, which are daily the Subject of Human Curio&s;ity. But tho' Ab&s;tinence
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
from Air is not, the Sort of Air which they u&s;e, is in the Power of a great many People: And as the Choice of Air is a Subject about which a Phy&s;ician's Advice is of|ten demanded, its Nature and dif|ferent Qualities is a proper one of his Studies; and it &s;eems prepo|&s;terous that there &s;hould be &s;o ma|ny minute Inquiries about the Qualities of every Drug which we take but &s;eldom, and none into the Effects of a Sub&s;tance that we take inwardly every Moment.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t famous Phy&s;icians have ob&s;erv'd, with great A&s;&s;idui|ty, the Effects of Air in the Oe|conomy of Di&s;ea&s;es, and none per|haps with &s;o much Accuracy as the fir&s;t Founder of our Art, the great <HI>Hippocrates.</HI> Air is the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in Di&s;ea&s;es, which he takes notice of. Air is what he means by the Powers of the Univer&s;e,
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
which he &s;ays Human Nature can|not overcome; and he lays it down as a Maxim, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Aere, Locis &amp; Aquis.</NOTE><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that whoever in|tends to be Ma&s;ter of the Art of Phy&s;ick, mu&s;t ob&s;erve the Con&s;ti|tution of the Year; that the Pow|ers and Influence of the Sea&s;ons (what are &s;eldom uniform) pro|duce great Changes in Human Bodies.'</Q> Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> endowed with the Genius of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> has left us Epidemicks wrote upon the Model of tho&s;e of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> containing a Hi&s;tory of acute Di&s;|ea&s;es as depending upon the Con|&s;titution of the Sea&s;on. Some eminent Phy&s;icians in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> have imitated Dr. <HI>Syden|ham;</HI> and a Society of learned and ingenious Gentlemen of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> are now pur|&s;uing the &s;ame Scheme. I was &s;o
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
uninqui&s;itive as not to have &s;een, till my <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> was almo&s;t fini&s;h'd, an excellent Performance in the &s;ame way, the No&s;ological Commentary of Dr. <HI>Clifton Winteringham,</HI> con|prehending the Hi&s;tory of Epide|mical Di&s;ea&s;es, with a Journal of the Weather in the City of <HI>York</HI> from 1715 to 1725. My Mi&s;|fortune in not &s;eeing it &s;ooner was le&s;&s;en'd in &s;ome Degree by finding &s;ome of my Rea&s;onings confirm'd by Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>In an Oration I made &s;ome Years ago before the College of Phy&s;icians, I recommended the keeping a Journal of the Weather and reigning Di&s;ea&s;es, as a Thing which might be of &s;ingular U&s;e, e&s;pecially to Po&s;terity: I have had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee this executed by the learned and indu&s;trious Profe&s;|&s;or <HI>Mu&s;&s;enberg,</HI> with &s;uch an elegant Contrivance, and &s;o nice an Ac|curacy
<PB N="x" REF="8">
in his Meteorological Ta|bles, that if the De&s;ign is pur&s;ued for many Years, it may perhaps reduce the Phy&s;iology of the Air to a Science.</P>
<P>As for the following E&s;&s;ay I pro|po&s;e it only as a Model of &s;ome|thing more perfect to be done af|terwards by an abler Pen upon the &s;ame Subject: It contains at lea&s;t a methodical Di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;e|veral Heads of Inquiry in rea&s;on|ing upon this Part of the Phy&s;iolo|gy of the Air. In compiling it, I purpo&s;ely avoided turning over a great many Books, or con&s;ider|ing any thing indeed but Mat|ter of Fact, upon which I found|ed my Rea&s;onings; and I ought to beg Pardon for the Pre&s;ump|tion of the Attempt, rather than &s;ay any thing for the Merit of the Work, in Excu&s;e for the Im|perfections, Inaccuracies, and per|haps
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
Mi&s;takes that are in it. I have the following Particulars to plead; that a great Part of it was wrote with frequent Interruptions, in &s;mall Portions of Time, and &s;ome Things from my Memory; that Wearine&s;s in thinking about the &s;ame Subject, incident to me perhaps with others of Mankind, made me abandon &s;everal Particu|lars too &s;oon; that I did not know any Friend who had &s;tudy'd the Subject enough to give me Advice; and therefore I now &s;et it before every body who is capable of putting me right, and I &s;hall be far from thinking that he that corrects, re|futes me. If there be any Inaccu|racies in the Numbers, they will not invalidate the Rea&s;oning. I think I may venture &s;o far as to affirm, that he who reads the whole over with due Attention will find it not quite an u&s;ele&s;s Speculation.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Contents of the AIR.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. _AIR is that thin Fluid which &s;urrounds the Earth in which we move and breathe. Air is not vi&s;ible. What we &s;ee in the Stream of Light let in by a &s;mall Aperture into a Room, is not Air, but Du&s;t, and other Bodies floating in the Air. Air is &s;en&s;ible to the Touch by its Motion, and by its Re&s;i&s;tance to Bodies moved in it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="15">
II. Air is the principal In&s;trument of Nature in all its Operations on and with|in the Surface of the Earth, except Magneti&s;m and Gravity. No Vegetable nor Animal, terre&s;trial nor aquatic, can be produc'd, live, or grow, without Air. Eggs cannot be hatch'd, nor Vegetables grow in a Void. Water, purg'd of Air, will not make Plants vegetate, at lea&s;t very &s;lowly, and that only by &s;ome Quantity of Air that is left in the Wa|ter. Air is the chief In&s;trument in the Oeconomy of Fo&s;&s;ils; all Operations, natural and artificial, on Fo&s;&s;ils, depend upon Air; for without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Air, Fire and Heat cea&s;e. In a word, Air is the principal In&s;trument in the Generation, Accretion, Re&s;olution, and Corruption of all terre&s;trial Bodies; for it enters into the Compo&s;ition of all Fluids and Solids, all of which gene|rate or produce Air in great Quantities: Oak has generated &frac13; of its Weight in Air, Pea&s;e as much, <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat &frac14;; Sub&s;tances oily and tenacious either do not produce it &s;o much, or part not with it &s;o ea&s;ily; as Honey, which does not yield 1/9; or Bees-wax, which yields 1/16; Minerals yield a great Quantity of Air, <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> Coal &frac13; of its Weight, <HI>Antimony</HI> about 28 times its Bulk, acid Spirits in So|lution
<PB N="3" REF="16">
of Metals generate great Quanti|ties. Tho&s;e who de&s;ire to know more of this Subject, may con&s;ult the <HI>Vegeta|ble Staticks</HI> of the ingenious and indu|&s;trious Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI> Animal Sub&s;tances are replete with Air more than any o|ther. Blood will generate 33 times its bulk of Air; and &s;olid animal Sub|&s;tances yield more Air than the Fluids; a human <HI>Calculus,</HI> or Stone, yields more than 645 times its bulk of Air; but of this more afterwards. At pre&s;ent we will briefly enumerate the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able Contents of this wonderful Fluid. The Air near the Surface of the Earth, in which all Animals live and breathe, contains the Steams, Effluvia, and all the Abra&s;ions of Bodies on the Surface of the Earth, when they are &s;o &s;mall and light as to float in it; from whence it is evident, that the Contents of it mu&s;t be different in different Places of the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall not enter into a Di&s;pute about the Nature of Fire; but if it be an Element that pervades all the Space of the Univer&s;e, as the learned <HI>Boer|haave</HI> imagines, Air mu&s;t contain its Proportion of this Element.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Air contains Water which is daily exhal'd, and daily falls from the Air; a
<PB N="4" REF="17">
Surface of Water, expos'd to the Air, evaporates an Inch in 13 Days; a Sur|face of Earth, with a Summer Heat, evaporates about an Inch in 40 Days; which Water, when the Air is over|charg'd with it, is return'd again, and falls upon the Surface of the Earth in Rain and Dew, which, by Ob&s;ervation in this Part of the terraqueous Globe, at a Medium, in a Year makes about 22 Inches of Rain, and 2&frac12; Inches of Dew; the Dew falls chiefly when the Sun is down, and near double the Quantity in a Winter of what falls in a Summer's Night. Thus it is plain, that there is a great Quantity of Water con&s;tantly floating in the Air; and ma|ny other Experiments demon&s;trate the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">V. Fix'd alkaline dry Salts attract, and are di&s;&s;olv'd by the watery Particles of the Air, &s;o as to increa&s;e in Weight from 34 to 57 in three Days; and this Effect may be carried on &s;o as to qua|druple the Weight, 1 Ounce of Salt of <HI>Tartar</HI> making 4 Ounces of Oil of <HI>Tartar, per deliquium,</HI> only by Attrac|tion of Water from the Air; reckoning a cubical Inch of Air to weigh 2/7 of a Grain, the additional Weight of 3 Ounces would make 5040 cubical Inches
<PB N="5" REF="18">
of Air, near 3 cubical Feet. There are many Con&s;equences, which &s;eem Para|doxical, to be drawn from this Experi|ment; for Example, that the mo&s;t pon|derous of Liquors, except <HI>Mercury,</HI> &s;hould be made of Salt and Air; that of Salt and Water, drawn from the Air, there &s;hould be made a Liquor of great|er &s;pecifick Gravity than the Mixture of the Ingredients; for the Oil of <HI>Tartar per deliquium</HI> is in weight to Water as 7 to 5; and one Part of Salt of <HI>Tartar,</HI> with three Parts of Water, will make a Liquor which is to Water as 6 to 5. What naturally follows from the Expe|riment is, that either there is a great Quantity of Water in the Air, or that the Water attracted by the Salt is drawn from a great Quantity of Air.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Air is, perhaps, mo&s;t charg'd with Water when it is clear; for when the Air is heavie&s;t, the Vapours a&s;cend the highe&s;t; but when they are highe&s;t, they are more eluted, and better mix'd with the Particles of Air; they a&s;cend at lea&s;t as high as the Tops of the highe&s;t Mountains, by the Clouds and Snow that are &s;een there, and where the Vapours often form Springs; when the watery Vapours turn a little heavier than the Air, they gather into Smoke or
<PB N="6" REF="19">
Clouds, which, when their Weight can|not be any more &s;u&s;tain'd by the Air, fall down in a thin Rain; and the&s;e Particles, by falling from greater Heights, unite, and form great Drops of Rain; and when frozen by the extreme Cold|ne&s;s of the Air, Snow and Hail; but the Manner of Generation of the&s;e Fruits of the Air, is foreign to my pre&s;ent Sub|ject. When by the Weight of the Air the Vapours a&s;cend highe&s;t, and are mo&s;t intimately mix'd with the Air, the lower Region in which we breathe may be &s;aid to be dry in re&s;pect to human Bodies.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Dew is another Ingredient of Air. Dew is not mere Water, but a Compo&s;ition of all the watery, volatile, oily, &s;aline Vapours, which exhale from the Earth, which, as long as they are agitated by the Sun, are not to be &s;een, but as &s;oon as the Air cools, they be|come vi&s;ible. The Air being a rare Bo|dy, cools much &s;ooner than the Earth, which continues &s;till to &s;weat out this Sub&s;tance after the Sun is down; and by the Cold of the Night a great deal of it falls down again in the Form of Water; for you may ob&s;erve, when there is no Wind, there is always to be &s;een a Coat of this Vapour near the
<PB N="7" REF="20">
Surface of the Earth. This Dew is a Collection of all the Sub&s;tances that tran&s;pire from that Spot of Earth, and con&s;equently very different in different Places, which is the Rea&s;on (as the learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ob&s;erves) that the Chymi&s;ts can never agree about the Con|tents of it, becau&s;e their Experiments are made upon the Dews of different Places, and con&s;equently of different Contents. In &s;ome Places it contains highly volatile and explo&s;ive Particles, &s;o that in Di&s;tillation it has broke the Gla&s;s; in others, it has &s;tain'd the Gla&s;s with the Colours of the Rainbow, which nothing could take out. <HI>May-</HI>Dew, being let &s;tand to putrify, will gather a fat Sub&s;tance like Cream a-top, with Vegetables and In&s;ects of different &s;orts; the Seeds of the one, and Eggs of the other being exhal'd. There is an Account of Dew falling, in &s;ome Places, in the Form of Butter, or Grea&s;e, which grows extremely foetid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Abridgment</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. II. p. 143.</NOTE>, &s;o that the Analy&s;is of the Dew of any Place may perhaps be the be&s;t Method of finding &s;uch Contents of the Soil as are
<PB N="8" REF="21">
within the Reach of the Heat of the Sun.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Air likewi&s;e contains the watery Exhalations, with the fragrant and volatile Spirit of all Vegetables. Spicy Odours are &s;melt at great Di&s;tances from the Countries where the Spices grow. The Quantity of the&s;e Exhalations of Vegetables mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable in Summer. By Experiments of the mo&s;t ingenious and indu&s;trious Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI>

Which is, at a Medium, 1/161 of an Inch in a Day, or a whole Inch in 161 Days, the Duration of the Summer. By an Experiment of the &s;ame inge|nious Gentleman, a Hop-yard of an Acre of Ground per&s;pires as much as would cover the whole Acre, an Inch in 101 Days. An Inch of this per&s;pi|rable watery Sub&s;tance rarify'd into Air, would make (as one might call it) a vegetable Atmo&s;phere of 71 Feet high. In the Summer the Ground is cover'd over with Vegetables; even the Gra&s;s expo&s;eth a great Surface to the Sun,
<PB N="9" REF="22">
and is not without Per&s;piration. The Heat ari&s;ing from vegetable Per&s;piration is very &s;en&s;ible in a hot Day near a Field of Corn. Upon this &s;ingle Ac|count of the Per&s;piration of Vegetables, the Air of the Summer mu&s;t be very different from that of the Winter. The Odours of &s;ome Plants have very &s;en|&s;ible Effects upon many People. The Oils, Salts, Seeds, and the in&s;en&s;ible Ab|ra&s;ions of Vegetables float in the Air. The Production of Plants in &s;ome Places, where the Plants were not indiginous, has puzzled Philo&s;ophers; perhaps it may be accounted for, from the two Methods of propagating Plants, the Seed and the Slip, both may float in the Air; as the Bigne&s;s of the Slip from whence the Plant is propagated is not determined, who can &s;ay but the in&s;en&s;ible Abra&s;ions of a Plant may produce it? This by the way.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Earth is another Content of the Air; Earth, calcin'd, flies off into the Air; the A&s;hes of burning Mountains, in Vulcanos, will be carried to great Di&s;tances.</P>
<P N="10">X. Salts of all kinds are another In|gredient of Air; fix'd fo&s;&s;ile Salts may be dige&s;ted, render'd volatile, and eva|porate in Air. Marka&s;ites attract vi|triolick
<PB N="10" REF="23">
Salts from the Air. Vitriol Stones mu&s;t be expos'd to the Air to produce Vitriol. Alum, robb'd of its Salt, recovers it in the Air. There may be obtain'd nitrous Salts from old Walls, in mo&s;t Places; the Air either &s;upply|ing the&s;e Salts as an Ingredient, or pro|ducing them as an Agent. In &s;ome Countries the Air will corrode the Bricks and Tiles. In Places abounding with Marka&s;ites, vitriolick Salts di&s;per&s;e them|&s;elves through the Air, which has been ob&s;erv'd to rot the Hangings of Rooms, and lie upon the Surface of the Ground like a white Efflore&s;cence. There are in the Air likewi&s;e the Particles of all Minerals; Gold, the heavie&s;t of them, can be render'd volatile, and Quick&s;il|ver likewi&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lei&s;ter</HI> imagines Thunder to be produced by the Ex|halations of the <HI>Pyrites.</HI> There is indeed &s;omething very remarkable in great Thunders, having &s;ometimes chang'd the Polarity of the Needle.</NOTE> All the Fumes which are rais'd by natural or artificial Fires vani&s;h into Air. The poi&s;onous Steams of Mines produce the &s;ame Effects as they would do in Di&s;tillations. All the Smoke of culinary Fires, and Steams of fermenting Liquors, vani&s;h in the Air, and make up a Part of the Contents of that in which we breathe.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="11" REF="24">
XI. Another Ingredient of the Air is the per&s;pirable Matter of Animals, the Per&s;piration of a Man is about 1/34 of an Inch in 24 hours all over the Surface of the Body; con&s;equently one Inch in 34 days. The Surface of the Skin of a mid|dle &s;iz'd Man is about 15 &s;quare Feet, con&s;equently the Surface of the Skins of 2904 &s;uch Men would cover an Acre of Ground, and the per&s;pir'd Matter would cover that Acre of Ground 1 Inch deep in 34 days, which rarify'd into Air would make over that Acre an Atmo&s;|phere of the Steams of their Bodies near 71 Foot high. The great Quantity of Animal Sub&s;tances, which are in the Air, appears further from this, that all Ex|crements and all the Carca&s;es of Animals vani&s;h into Air, of tho&s;e that are burnt very &s;oon, of tho&s;e that are expos'd later, of tho&s;e that are buried in length of time; but all the Parts of the Car|ca&s;es at la&s;t vani&s;h into Air, except per|haps a &s;mall Quantity of Bones into Earth. Eggs of In&s;ects float in the Air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boerhaave.</NOTE>. Fle&s;h hung up by a Thread, where no Fly could come, was filled with Mag|gots. The Caterpillars and other In&s;ects,
<PB N="12" REF="25">
which &s;o &s;uddenly eat up the Leaves of Trees, perhaps are produced by the Eggs of tho&s;e In&s;ects floating in the Air; at lea&s;t one does not ea&s;ily perceive how they could be lodg'd in the Plants them|&s;elves. In <HI>Africk</HI> there are Showers which affect the Bodies of Men with Rigors, the Drops are found to have In&s;ects in them; and perhaps there are In&s;ects in the Air invi&s;ible to human Eyes: One may ob&s;erve in that part of a Room, which is illuminated with the Rays of the Sun, Flies &s;ometimes darting like Hawks, as it were upon a Prey.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Sulphurs ari&s;e from many Parts of the Earth in great Quantities; in Mines there are Fumes &s;tinking, oily, In|flammable. The&s;e &s;ulphurous Exhalations combin'd with &s;ome Salts or mettalline Particles produce Explo&s;ions, and all the Effects of Gunpowder in Earthquakes, Thunder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are In&s;tances after Thunder of &s;ulphurous burning Showers; &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ulphurous Steams &s;eem to ri&s;e by a projectile Motion to great Heights, &s;o they do likewi&s;e <HI>in vacuo</HI> with a great Celerity. This appears by Meteors, &s;uch as that in the Year 1718, which Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has prov'd by Ob&s;erva|tions to be 60 Miles high, of a Mile Diameter, and run 300 Miles in a Mi|nute:
<PB N="13" REF="26">
There mu&s;t have been Air to pro|pagate the Sound of the Explo&s;ion of that Meteor which was heard in &s;ome Places. Tho' the Air at that Height was 30000 times rarer than that near the Surface of the Earth, it &s;eems it was ca|pable of producing Sounds. The Coru&s;|cations which have often of late appear'd in this Country, &s;eem'd to be of the &s;ame Nature, particularly that remarkable one 1716. In tho&s;e Coru&s;cations one might ob&s;erve the &s;ulphurous Steams ri&s;e from the Earth with a projectile Motion, to a great Height, and being con&s;um'd, have not di&s;cover'd any ill Effect upon human Bodies.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Air near the Surface is charg'd with all tho&s;e heterogeneous Parti|cles, and many others not po&s;&s;ible to enumerate; and yet the wi&s;e Author of Nature has temper'd this heterogeneous Mixture, &s;o as to make it &s;alubrious to the Animals that live in it, except in a few accidental Ca&s;es; and perhaps pure Air without any of tho&s;e Contents is un|fit to &s;u&s;tain Animals and Vegetables. To make this Element whol&s;om, the wi&s;e Author of Nature has &s;o order'd that the whole Ma&s;s is never overcharg'd with tho&s;e Contents. For Example, &s;ince hu|man

Bodies are &s;o contriv'd, as not to bear Exce&s;&s;es of any kind, as too much Drine&s;s, or too much Fluidity, there is a con&s;tant Circulation of the Water in the Air, and the Air of any Place contains very near the &s;ame Quantity of it. The Action of the Sun, or the Sum of all its Force upon the &s;ame Surface of Land and Water, and the Heat of the Surface of the Earth within the Year, is pretty near uniform, and con&s;equently the Quan|tity of Evaporation the &s;ame: The Air has a Power of imbibing and &s;u&s;taining only a certain Quantity of this Water, and the Sum of the Quantity that falls from the Air over the whole Surface of the Earth, in Rain, Snow, or Hail, is the &s;ame, tho' by accidental Cau&s;es of Winds, and the Stoppage of the Clouds, by Tracts of Mountains, more of the&s;e Vapours may be carried, and fall in one Place than another. This Water is again carried by its natural Gravity in Streams to the Sea, and other Re&s;ervoirs of Water, and from thence again exhal'd; only there is left a &s;ufficient Quantity for the Nutrition of Plants and Animals; the Moi&s;ture of who&s;e Bodies is again ex|hal'd, and this Circulation is con&s;tantly maintain'd; only there remains one Doubt, that the &s;olid Parts of Animals,

<P N="14">XIV. Nature makes u&s;e of all po&s;&s;i|ble ways, to pre&s;erve this heterogeneous Fluid in a whol&s;om State. The Ingre|dients are dige&s;ted and attenuated by Heat; they are &s;tirr'd and con&s;tantly agitated by Winds, which mix the Air of different Regions together; there are Fermentations &s;ucceeded by violent Mo|tions and Explo&s;ions, in Lightning and Thunder, and imitable by the Mixture of like Ingredients in Chymical Opera|tions. In tho&s;e Storms the redundant and noxious &s;ulphurous Particles are con|&s;um'd.

Air is the In&s;trument of all tho&s;e Operations when perform'd by Art; and tho&s;e heterogeneous Bodies act upon one another in the Air it &s;elf, by many unconceivable ways: Many Experiments and Ob&s;ervations demon|&s;trate the mutual Action of Bodies floating in the Air upon their approach. Some Chymical Proce&s;&s;es will &s;ucceed in one &s;ort of Air; which will be attempt|ed in vain in another: <HI>Tartarus regenera|tus</HI> can be made only in a Laboratory, where they di&s;til Vinegar.

<P N="15">XV. Tho' Nature pre&s;erves the Ma&s;s of this Fluid in a whol&s;om State; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen, that the Air of particular Regions, Sea&s;ons, and Places may differ very much in their Proporti|ons of the Mixture of the Ingredients enumerated; and &s;uch Air mu&s;t affect human Bodies variou&s;ly by &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es or Defects.

and too great Drine&s;s with another: The Powers of Human Bodies being limited and intolerant of Exce&s;&s;es of any kind. Air replete with the Steams of Ani|mals, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are rotting, has often produced pe&s;tilential Fevers in that Place, of which there are many In|&s;tances, as that mention'd by <HI>Ambro&s;e Paree</HI> 1562, rais'd by Carca&s;es thrown into a Ditch. Such have likewi&s;e been rais'd by great Quantities of dead Lo|cu&s;ts, and by dead Whales.

And whether it is not proper that all Burying Places &s;hould be without Cities in the open Air? By what was ob&s;erv'd N^o viii. the Air of the Summer differs con&s;iderably from that of Winter. In Summer the Air is replete with the per|&s;pirable Matter of Vegetables, abound|ing with volatile Spirits and Oils, which perhaps &s;timulates and exhilirates the Spirits; and that of &s;ome Plants is too powerful for &s;ome People, who cannot &s;upport the Smell of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. It follows from Ob&s;ervations, N^o xi. That the Air of great Cities differs con&s;iderably from that of the Country.

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Properties of Air.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE fir&s;t Property of Air is Fluidity, which by no Power of Art or Nature yet known can be de|&s;troy'd; it pre&s;erves its Fluidity in Cold 44 Degrees greater than any Natural Cold: The Sparkling, which <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ob&s;erv'd in Air illuminated by the Rays of the Sun, and which he at fir&s;t ima|gin'd to proceed from &s;ome Congelation of the Air, he afterwards di&s;cover'd to proceed from watery Particles floating in the Air. No Conden&s;ation, Fermenta|tion,
<PB N="23" REF="36">
nor Coagulation of Mixtures, where Air re&s;ides, have ever de&s;troy'd its Flui|dity, which Quality is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to an Element, in which Vegetables and Animals grow. No Vegetable nor Animal can expand its Fibres, in their Natural Figure, but in a Fluid that re|&s;i&s;ts equally the Elongation of its Fibres: The Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere keeps both Vegetables and animal Fibres within certain Limits of Accretion; it being always Fluid, the Pre&s;&s;ure is equal upon every Part of their Surfaces. There|fore if you would give a human Creature the due Figure which Nature affects, it mu&s;t be kept as free as po&s;&s;ible from the Pre&s;&s;ure of any hard Body: Human Crea|tures by being a great Part of their time upon their Feet, which is but a &s;mall Part of the Surface of the whole Body, acquire a better Shape, and the Feet by bearing the Pre&s;&s;ure of the whole Body grow Callous; if a human Creature were always recumbent it would not take its Natural Figure. Confinement by Stays or &s;trait Clothes mu&s;t &s;poil or change the natural Shape: Water being a Fluid much den&s;er than Air, admits, &s;upports and keeps together the Bodies of larger Animals than Air can do.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="37">
II. The Particles of Air are not di&s;cernable by a Micro&s;cope, tho' they may be larger than the Particles of Light; they do not reflect it in vi&s;ual Angles.</P>
<P N="3">III. Notwith&s;tanding the Minutene&s;s of the Particles of Air, many den&s;er Fluids will pa&s;s where it cannot; Oil will enter through Leather, which excludes Air.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Lubricity or Divi&s;ibility by the &s;malle&s;t Force, is another Property of Air, by which Animals move in it, without much Re&s;i&s;tance; if there were Experiments of the Swiftne&s;s of the Motion of Birds and Fi&s;hes, one could determine the Proportion of their Force. Birds and Fi&s;hes move through their re|&s;pective Element after the &s;ame manner: Fi&s;hes are the Birds of the Water. Fi&s;hes pa&s;s through an Element 800 times den&s;er than Air, upon which Account they mu&s;t employ a Force proportional to the greater Re&s;i&s;tance of the Medi|ums: on the other hand a great Part of the Force of Birds is employ'd to &s;up|port their Bodies in a much rarer Me|dium, whereas the Bodies of Fi&s;hes are equilibrated with the Water in which they &s;wim. Yet the Air has &s;ome Degree of Tenacity, whereby the Parts attract one another, as appears by the &s;pherical
<PB N="25" REF="38">
Figure of Bubbles, which attract and run into one another. At the &s;ame time by their Ela&s;ticity the Particles of Air in o|ther Circum&s;tances &s;eem to have a Power of Repul&s;ion or Flying off from one ano|ther; tho&s;e two Properties are con&s;i&s;tent as we &s;ee in Light.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Re&s;i&s;tance of Air is very con|&s;iderable in Bodies mov'd &s;wiftly through it, or by its &s;wift Motion again&s;t Bo|dies: The Re&s;i&s;tance in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e increa&s;eth in the Duplicate Proportion of the Celerity of the moving Body, that is, the Re&s;i&s;tance is 100 times greater when the Celerity is but ten times; &s;o therefore if light Bodies be moved with a great Velocity, the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air will throw them back in another Direction. Air mov'd with Rapidity in violent Winds, has very &s;en&s;ible Effects upon human Bodies; we &s;ee the power|ful Effects of a large Surface of Air or Wind, in moving great Bodies and turn|ing Engines: A Stream of Air of 7 Square Feet, near the half of the Sur|face of a human Body, moved with a Velocity of a great Wind or 22 Feet in a Second of Time, pre&s;&s;eth again&s;t a hu|man Body with a Force equal to Water mov'd 1&frac12; Feet in a Minute, to which, if you add the Celerity of the Per&s;on
<PB N="26" REF="39">
moving oppo&s;ite, the Pre&s;&s;ure is very con&s;iderable; &s;o that riding or walking again&s;t great Winds is a great Exerci&s;e; the Effects of which are Redne&s;s and In|flammation of the Parts expo&s;ed to the Air, all the Effects of a &s;oft Pre&s;s or Ver|beration, Heat and Drou&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Gravity is another Property of Air, whereby it counterpoi&s;es a Column of Mercury from 27&frac12; Inches to 30&frac12;, the <HI>Gravity</HI> of the Atmo&s;phere varying 1/10, which are its utmo&s;t limits; &s;o that the exact &s;pecifick Gravity of the Air can|not be determin'd when the Barometer &s;tands at 30 Inches, with a moderate Heat of the Weather. The &s;pecifick Gravity of the Air is to that of Water about 1 to 800, and to that of Mercury as 1 to 10800. Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Account of the Cau&s;es of the&s;e Variations of the Gravity of the Air &s;eems very &s;atisfacto|ry; for they mu&s;t either proceed from the Air in one Time and Place, being charg'd with greater or le&s;&s;er Quantities of pon|derous Contents; which, by what is &s;aid in the foregoing Chapter, it imbibes plentifully, or from being accumulated more in one Place than another: The Air's being accumulated more in one Place than another, mu&s;t proceed from the Currents of Air or Winds; thus con|trary
<PB N="27" REF="40">
Currents of Air tending to the &s;ame Place, mu&s;t accumulate the Air in that Place, and con&s;equently rai&s;e the Mercury in the Barometer, as a We&s;ter|ly Wind in the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> and an Ea&s;ter|ly in the <HI>German</HI> Ocean: Two Currents of Air from the &s;ame Place, mu&s;t &s;ink the Air in that Place, and con&s;equently the Mercury in the Barometer: This is very po&s;&s;ible in Liquids, and happens even in the Motion of the Tides; if there was always a perfect Calm, the <HI>Aequilibrium</HI> could only be charg'd by the greater or &s;maller Quantity of ponderous Contents; in confirmation of this Sy&s;tem it is found, where the Winds are not va|riable, as near the Line, the Alterations of the Baro&s;cope are very &s;mall. The&s;e Alterations of the Gravity of the Air cannot proceed from its letting fall its ponderous Contents, as in great Showers. It is true, that a heavy Body falling thro' a Fluid, during its De&s;cent, does not pre&s;s upon it, but by the Re&s;i&s;tance which the Fluid gives to its Motion in De&s;cent; but the Decrea&s;e of the Weight of the Atmo&s;phere during the Fall of Rain, Snow, or Hail, is not proportional to this Cau&s;e, nor can be accounted for from it.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The Air being fluid and heavy, pre&s;&s;eth equally upon the Surface of a
<PB N="28" REF="41">
Human Body, with a Weight equal to a Column of Mercury, who&s;e Ba&s;is is equal to the Surface of a Human Bo|dy; and Altitude, that of the Barome|ter, perhaps in a middle-&s;iz'd Man, with a Weight of 32000 Pounds, as it is po&s;|&s;ible for the Air to vary 1/10 in its Weight, &s;uch a Human Body mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed with 3200 Pound Weight more at one time than another; and if the Height of the Mercury varies only one Inch, there is the Difference of above 1000 Pounds. Such Alterations affect both the Fluids and Solids very &s;en&s;ibly; but as the Coun|terpoi&s;e between the Air within and that without the Body, is quickly re|&s;tor'd by the free Communication that is between them, the&s;e Alterations are &s;uf|fered without any &s;en&s;ible Inconvenience; and this indeed proves the ready Admi&s;|&s;ion of the external Air into the Ve&s;&s;els of the Body, and the E&s;cape of a|erial Particles within the Body, in each Ca&s;e of the Alteration of the Gravity of the external Air, from le&s;s to more, or more to le&s;s; for if this <HI>Aequilibrium</HI> was not kept between the external Air, and that within the Body, both the Fi|bres and Fluids being ela&s;tick, in the Ca&s;e of an Increa&s;e of the Gravity of the ex|ternal Air, the Fluids and Solids would
<PB N="29" REF="42">
be too much compre&s;s'd; and in the Ca&s;e of a Decrea&s;e of this Gravity, would expand them&s;elves with a dolorous Sen|&s;ation, and Danger to the Life of the Animal. A Fall of the Mercury in the Barometer is the &s;ame with the Ex&s;uction of &s;o much Air in an Air-Pump, in which Ca&s;e we perceive the Fluids and Solids expand them&s;elves, and the Ani|mal &s;wells. I have ob&s;erv'd very &s;en&s;i|ble Effects of &s;udden Falls of the Mer|cury in the Barometer in tender People, and all the Symptoms they would have felt by the Ex&s;uction of &s;o much Air in an Air-Pump: Animals in the Air-Pump are relieved of their Symptoms in a great mea&s;ure, by voiding of Air or Wind out of their Bodies; therefore, if the&s;e Alterations of the Air were very &s;udden, and to great Degrees, they would produce very great and trouble&s;ome Symptoms in Human Bodies. As the Ca&s;e &s;tands now, the Variations of the Gravity of the Air keep both the Solids and the Fluids in an o&s;cillatory Motion, &s;ynchronous, and proportional to their Changes, and which, by the different Degrees of Ten&s;ion of the Fibres, and Expan&s;ion of the Fluids, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly affect Human Bodies variou&s;ly, and produce Alterations, of which the Inha|bitants
<PB N="30" REF="43">
of Countries where the Mercury in the Barometer &s;tands at the &s;ame Height, are not &s;en&s;ible; but of this more after|wards.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Air is a Fluid in con&s;tant Mo|tion: One may perceive in that Part of a Room which is illuminated by the Sun-beams entring at a &s;mall Hole, the Bodies floating in the Air are in continual Mo|tion; a con&s;tant undulatory Motion is perceiv'd by looking through Tele|&s;copes: The&s;e Undulations of the Air af|fect &s;mall and tender Bodies, yet not &s;o much as to alter their Figures; when the Air enters or e&s;capes out of Bodies, it does not divide it &s;elf at fir&s;t into its mi|nute&s;t Particles, but gathers into Bubbles; and the Nature of Air is &s;uch, that the &s;malle&s;t Quantity of it has the Force of the whole Atmo&s;phere, by its Spring or Ela&s;ticity; of which in the next Article. If Air Bubbles are generated in the Ca|vities of the Ve&s;&s;els of Human Bodies, they mu&s;t produce prodigious Effects.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Air is likewi&s;e compre&s;&s;ible and ela&s;tick: It can be compre&s;s'd into Spaces reciprocally proportional to the incum|bent Weights, and expands it &s;elf again in Proportion as the compre&s;&s;ing Force is remov'd: If the Weights compre&s;&s;ing be as 1, 2, 3, the Spaces into which
<PB N="31" REF="44">
the Air is compre&s;s'd will be as 1, &frac12;, &frac14;, con&s;equently the Den&s;ity of the Air will increa&s;e in direct Proportion to the compre&s;&s;ing Weights; therefore, as you approach towards the Surface of the Earth, the Den&s;ity of the Air increa&s;eth, becau&s;e of the greater Height of the Co|lumn of incumbent Air; as you go higher, the Air expands it&s;elf, and grows rarer, by the Force of its Spring or Ela&s;|ticity, having &s;o much of the incum|bent Weight taken off. Were the whole Air of equal Den&s;ity, the Atmo&s;phere would not much exceed the Height of 5 Miles, and in the A&s;cent of 900 Foot the Mercury would &s;ink 1 Inch, and &s;o on: But, as I &s;aid before, the Expan&s;ion of the Air increa&s;ing, that is, the Air growing rarer as the incumbent Weight is taken off, an A&s;cent of 915 Feet from the Surface of the Earth &s;inks the Mer|cury 1 Inch; but as you a&s;cend higher, it requires a greater Space of this thinner Air to make the Mercury &s;ink another Inch, and that is found to be 1862 Feet, or more than double the former Height, and to &s;ink the Mercury 3 Inches re|quires an A&s;cent of 2844, which is more than triple of 915; the Height of 1 Mile is requir'd to &s;ink the Mercury 5.32, that is about 5 Inches and &frac13; of an
<PB N="32" REF="45">

The Ela&s;ticity of the Air is a Force equal to its Gravity; for, as I &s;aid, the &s;malle&s;t Bubble of Air by its Ela&s;|ticity will counterpoi&s;e the whole At|mo&s;phere of equal Den&s;ity: By tho&s;e two Qualities of Gravity and Ela&s;ticity, and the Variations of them, the Air pro|duceth great Effects upon Human Bodies; by the&s;e, Re&s;piration is performed, and the Balance kept between the external Air and that within the Ve&s;&s;els of the Body: Yet I cannot but ob&s;erve that
<PB N="33" REF="46">
there is &s;omething very hard to be under|&s;tood in the Gravity and Ela&s;ticity of the Air. Suppo&s;e Air is in &s;pecifick Gra|vity to Water as 1 to 800: If there be 1/800 of Water in Air, the Air it &s;elf mu&s;t weight nothing; becau&s;e &s;o much Water is equiponderant with the &s;ame Quanti|ty of Water. I have &s;een a Summer Shower of long duration, which has filled a Tub 3 Inches perpendicular; 33 Feet of Water weighs equally with the whole Atmo&s;phere, 3 Inches of Water is &frac14; of 1/33 or 1/132 of the Weight of the whole Atmo&s;phere, much more than 1/800. It would &s;eem, that &s;o great a Quantity of Water could not be at once in the Air of that Place, but mu&s;t have been collected in Clouds from a great Quantity of Air. Water is mix'd with Air in the Form of Smoke, which is perhaps a Collection of Bubbles, with a vi&s;cous Coat of Water about them, and are lighter than Air; but &s;till there is &s;o much Water in the Air whatever Form it is in, be&s;ides Water there are a great many other Contents in the Air &s;pecifi|cally heavier than Air; if the Proportion of tho&s;e Contents is not extremely &s;mall, Air it &s;elf mu&s;t weigh nothing. Then as to the Compre&s;&s;ibity of Air, that mu&s;t have certain Limits, and can never go
<PB N="34" REF="47">
beyond the Quantity of Water, and other incompre&s;&s;ible Sub&s;tances that are in Air. The Rarity and Den&s;ity of Air has likewi&s;e its Bounds; for if the Law of Expan&s;ion obtain'd con&s;tantly, a Globe of Air of an Inch Diameter, at the Di&s;tance of a Semidiameter of the Earth, would fill all the Space of the Planetary Regions further than the Sphere of <HI>Saturn:</HI> As to the Den&s;ity of the Air, &s;uppo&s;e a Tube, or, as the Miners call it, a Shaft were &s;unk from the Surface of the Earth to the Centre within the Sur|face of the Earth, the Gravity of Bodies is as the Di&s;tance from the Centre; yet according to the Laws of Den&s;ity, by a Computation too long to in&s;ert here, at 50 Miles deep, Air would be den&s;er than Mercury, and near the Centre infinitely den&s;er than Gold. This is an impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition; and all the Air above and within the Earth, of the Den&s;ity of Mer|cury, wou'd not compo&s;e a Ring round the Surface of the Earth, of perhaps a Yard high. Therefore the Compre&s;&s;ibility, Den|&s;ity and Rarity of the Air have Limits which they cannot exceed.</P>
<P N="12">XII. True Air never lo&s;eth its Ela&s;ti|city, tho' it exerts it only when collected into a Ma&s;s by its Ela&s;ticity; it in&s;inuates it &s;elf in the Spaces of Liquors not &s;uffi|ciently

<P N="13">XIII. Animal Fluids and Solids con|tain more Air in them in Proportion than perhaps any other Sub&s;tances. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI></NOTE> Hartshorn will yield 1/7 of its whole Sub&s;tance or 234 times its Bulk in Air. A human Calculus can be almo&s;t all evaporated by Fire. Animal Fluids do not contain &s;o much Air as the Solids; but they contain a greater Proportion of Air than other watery Fluids. Blood contains 1/27 Part of its Weight in Air, and 33 times its Bulk; whereas 54 Inches of Well-Water yield but 1 Inch of Air: Suppo&s;ing the Spe|cifick Gravity of Water to be to that of Air as 800 to 1, Water contains only 1/43200 of its Weight in Air. <HI>Bri&s;tol-</HI>Water and <HI>Holt-</HI>Water yield much the &s;ame Proportion as common Water, but <HI>Pyrmont-</HI>Water double the Quantity; the Activity of Chalybeat Water is owing to

Therefore the Variation of the Gravity and Ela&s;ticity of the Air, which propor|tionally expand and dilate the Liquors, with which the external Air communi|cates, mu&s;t have &s;en&s;ible Effects upon animal Fluids, as Air is a principal In|&s;trument in all the animal Oeconomy; and therefore a principal Ingredient in the Compo&s;ition of animal Sub&s;tances. It mu&s;t in a particular manner affect a|nimal Bodies, and variou&s;ly by its Changes influence all their Operations. This only in general.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Air of double Den&s;ity has dou|ble the Force; for if Air of a certain Den&s;ity keeps up the Mercury in the Ba|rometer 28 Inches, the &s;ame Capacity fill'd with Air of a double Den&s;ity will keep it up 56 Inches. Heat increa&s;eth the Ela&s;ticity of the Air.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Heat of boiling Water will augment the Force of the Spring of the Air &frac13;, if the Air is &s;hut up; or ex|pand it into &frac13; more of Space if it is at Liberty; if the Air be doubly den&s;e, the
<PB N="37" REF="50">
&s;ame Degree of Heat acts with a double Force upon it. For Example, if common Air keeps up the Mercury in the Barometer at 30 Inches, the Heat of boiling Wa|ter will increa&s;e its Force &frac13;, and make it &s;u&s;tain the Mercury at 40 Inches; but if Air is doubly den&s;er, the Augmenta|tion of the Spring by the &s;ame Degree of Heat would be 20 Inches, and &s;uch an Air with double the Den&s;ity, and the &s;ame Degree of Heat, would &s;u&s;tain the Mercury 80 Inches, 60 upon account of its double Den&s;ity, and 20 which is the Augmentation of &frac13; of the Force by Heat; &s;o that den&s;er Air heated mu&s;t have great Effects, &s;uch as &s;ubterraneous Air in great Depths. For Example, Air 100 times den&s;er with the Heat of boiling Water, would have above 133 times the Force of common Air. The Heat of boiling Water will increa&s;e the Force of the Air, or expand it &frac13; more; but greater Heats, as that of melting Iron, &s;uch as may happen in &s;ubterraneous Places, would produce much greater Effects. The greate&s;t Alteration of the Den&s;ity of the Air, by the Difference of Heat and Cold in our Climate, does not ex|ceed &frac18;, which is indeed very con&s;idera|ble. This by Mr. <HI>Hauksbees</HI> Experiment, but there are others, in which the Difference
<PB N="38" REF="51">
is greater. Cold likewi&s;e increa&s;eth the Ela&s;ticity of the Air by increa&s;ing its Den&s;ity or Weight, to which its ela&s;tical Force is proportional. We &s;hall treat more fully, in the following Part of this E&s;&s;ay, of the&s;e Qualities of the Air, of Heat, Cold, Moi&s;ture and Drine&s;s, and as they are combin'd with its Proper|ties of Gravity and Ela&s;ticity, and of their Effects on Human Bodies.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. By what has been &s;aid of the Ela&s;ticity of the Air, and which the &s;malle&s;t Ma&s;s of it pa&s;&s;eth, &s;o as to be able to re&s;i&s;t the Pre&s;&s;ure of the whole incumbent Atmo&s;phere, one may per|ceive the great Force of hot and ela&s;tick Air in the Cavities of Human Bodies; whither Air-Bubbles may be generated in the Ve&s;&s;els of Human Bodies, I &s;hall not po&s;itively determine. Strong Probabi|lities for the affirmative are, that Air-Bubbles are apt to get into Pipes which carry any Fluid even into tho&s;e which carry Water; and their Effects are well known. It is likewi&s;e certain, and what I have known by frequent Experience, that there are Pains in the Extremities of the Body, which &s;eems flatulent; and I have often perceived by Friction of the&s;e Parts immen&s;e Quantities of Wind to come out of the Stomach by Belching,
<PB N="39" REF="52">
by which the Patient was reliev'd. Air is not ty'd to the Laws of Circulation, but will break out wherever it can have a Vent; the Force of an Air-Bubble to produce Ten&s;ion and Pain is &s;ufficient. By what is &s;aid,</P>
<P N="17">XVII. It &s;eems likewi&s;e probable that Spa&s;ms and Convul&s;ions are produced by hot and ela&s;tick Air, or Steams pent up. The Symptoms of Animals &s;hut up in an exhau&s;ted Receiver are Convul&s;ions; and as &s;oon as tho&s;e Animals have voided Air, through all the Emi&s;&s;aries of their Bodies, &s;o as to bring the Air within their Ve&s;&s;els to a Balance with the out|ward rarer Air of the Recipient, they &s;eem to recover for a Moment, 'till by a new Ex&s;uction of Air, they relap&s;e into the &s;ame Condition, as I ob&s;erved before: Some tender human Creatures are apt to fall into Lypothymies upon a &s;udden Fall of the Mercury in the Barometer, which puts them in the &s;ame Ca&s;e with the fir&s;t Ex&s;uction of Air in the Air-Pump.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Human Creatures can live in Air of very different Den&s;ities; the Air in the &s;ame Place may differ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/10 in Den|&s;ity or Weight, &s;o much being the Varia|tion of the Height of the Mercury; but what is more &s;trange, Human Creatures can live in Airs where the Difference of

<P N="19">XIX. Though human Creatures can &s;up|port &s;uch a Difference of Pre&s;&s;ure, as in the common Variation of Gravity in the &s;ame Place, makes the Difference of Pre&s;&s;ure upon a Body of an ordinary Size 3600 Pound Weight, and in the Difference of Altitude in the Bottom of Mines, and at the Tops of the highe&s;t Mountains, the Difference of 18000 Weight; yet &s;uch a Difference of Pre&s;&s;ure mu&s;t produce great Difference in the Ten&s;ion of the Fibres, and Expan&s;ion of the Fluids of a Human Body. In the Ca&s;e of a greater Weight, the Fibres being more &s;trongly brac'd and the Fluids more compacted, and, as I ob&s;erv'd before, were there not a free Communication between the external Air, and the Air within the animal Fluids, the&s;e Changes would be in&s;uppor|table; and the Animal would be in the &s;ame Ca&s;e as in an Air-Pump with the Ex&s;uction of half the Air; in which Ca&s;e the Blood would boil up and ex|pand it &s;elf to a great Degree by &s;o much
<PB N="41" REF="54">
of the Pre&s;&s;ure of the external Air being taken off. All this is prevented by the quick Expul&s;ion and Admi&s;&s;ion of the Air within and without the Body.</P>
<P N="20">XX. It &s;eems probable that the Di|minution of the Force of the Pre&s;&s;ure of the external Air, in bracing the Fi|bres, mu&s;t create a Debility in mu&s;cular Motion, which is the Rea&s;on that &s;ome People have imagined they breath'd &s;horter than u&s;ual in a&s;cending the Tops of high Mountains; but the true Rea|&s;on is, that by the Diminution of the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air upon the Mu&s;cles, le&s;s Exerci&s;e puts one out of Breath; and perhaps the Overbalance of the Air within the Thorax may have &s;ome Ef|fect. But then it may be objected, That Mountaineers are not le&s;s active and &s;trong than the Inhabitants of low Countries: To which I an&s;wer, That there are two Cau&s;es which hinder this Effect; the fir&s;t is the Exce&s;s of Cold|ne&s;s of the Air on the Tops of Moun|tains, above that of lower Situations, which counterbalanceth the le&s;s Weight, and braceth the Fibres more &s;trongly; by rea&s;on of this Exce&s;s of Coldne&s;s in greater Altitudes, the Decrea&s;e of the Den&s;ities of the Air does not preci&s;ely an&s;wer Calculation: Another Rea&s;on
<PB N="42" REF="55">
&s;eems to be this, That &s;uch as live in a rarer Air, are habituated to the Exer|ci&s;e of a greater mu&s;cular Strength, they are as it were in the Ca&s;e of Birds, which, performing their Motions in a rarer Medium, mu&s;t always u&s;e a great|er mu&s;cular Strength, which, tho' indeed Nature has endued them with the very Habit of u&s;ing it, mu&s;t &s;trengthen their Fibres.

<P N="21">XXI. The Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air upon the Lungs is much le&s;s than it has been computed by &s;ome; but &s;till it is &s;ome|thing, and the Alteration of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/10 of its Force upon the Lungs mu&s;t produce &s;ome Difference in elutriating the Blood as it pa&s;&s;eth through the Lungs, which are the chief In&s;truments of Sanguifica|tion. The Variations of the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air, in its Gravity and Ela&s;ti|city, mu&s;t produce proportional o&s;cilla|tory Motions in the Fluids and Solids of Human Bodies; and when the Ex|cur&s;ions are extreme and frequent, &s;uch great Agitations of the Fluids and So|lids may produce great Alterations in Human Bodies; for which there is no need to have Recour&s;e to occult Qua|lities in the Air.

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Qualities of the Air.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. I CALL Fluidity, Gravity, Ela&s;ti|city, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Properties of the Air, re|&s;iding con&s;tantly in the whole Ma&s;s, and every Part of it. Heat, Cold, Dryne&s;s, and Moi&s;ture, I choo&s;e to term Qualities, becau&s;e, taken in the vulgar Sen&s;e, they are variable, and do not con&s;tantly in|here in the Whole, nor in the Parts.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Air, by the&s;e variable Quali|ties of Heat, Cold, Dryne&s;s, and Moi|&s;ture,
<PB N="44" REF="57">
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce great Va|riety of Changes in Human Bodies. Let us conceive a Fluid permanently warm, as Human Blood, inclos'd in a Sy&s;tem of Tubes, thin, flexible, to which the outward Air has admittance by innumera|ble Pa&s;&s;ages: Let us conceive this Sy|&s;tem, with its inclos'd Fluid, &s;teaming and reeking hot through innumerable Pa&s;&s;ages, changing Situation, &s;ometimes within, &s;ometimes without Doors, and expos'd to the cold, hot, dry, wet Air, and all the Variety of Changes which happen in that Element; the Changes which mu&s;t happen to this Sy&s;tem or Machine in the&s;e Circum&s;tances, are not the twentieth Part of what happens to Human Bodies; which, be&s;ides the real Influence of the circumambient Air, is affected by the Changes with a dolorous or plea&s;ant Sen&s;ation, which it has not always in its Power to avoid or enjoy.</P>
<P N="3">III. Heat and Cold are Qualities re|lative to our Sen&s;es; and Cold perhaps only a Privation or le&s;s Degree of Heat or Motion. The Spirit of Wine in Ther|mometers being affected with the &s;malle&s;t Changes of Heat and Cold, is a proper Index of the&s;e Alterations, though the Degrees mark'd in the Tubes are not the exact Mea&s;ures of the Quantity of
<PB N="45" REF="58">
them: However, waving the Imper|fections of that In&s;trument, I &s;hall only adverti&s;e the Reader, that in my Ob&s;er|vations of the Degrees of the Heat of the Air, I refer to tho&s;e made by two Thermometers, <HI>Farenheit</HI>'s, and one in|vented by Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> fitted to Ob&s;erva|tions upon his Subject. In <HI>Farenheit</HI>'s Thermometer, at 32 Degrees, the Wa|ter in the Air begins to freeze, which is known by hoar Fro&s;ts; the Cold in|crea&s;ing will &s;ink the Spirit to 5 De|grees; and it has been known to &s;ink it to 0 by Cold, in which &s;carce any Animal could live; by common artifi|cial Cold it can be &s;unk 4 Degrees be|low 0; and by an uncommon Experi|ment has been &s;unk 40 Degrees below 0. The Air is temperate at 46 De|grees, and by natural Heat &s;eldom reaches 90; and if you by artificial Heat rai&s;e it 122 Degrees more, &s;o as to reach 212, this is the Heat of boiling Water; &s;o that 252 is the Di&s;tance between the greate&s;t artificial Cold, and the Heat of boiling Water; and 207 Degrees the Di&s;tance between the greate&s;t natural Cold common in this Climate, and the Heat of boiling Water by this Thermo|meter. The natural Heat of an adult Per&s;on is 92, and of Children 94. No
<PB N="46" REF="59">
Animal can live long in an Air of 90, or near the natural Heat of the Bo|dy.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s Thermometer is chief|ly contriv'd for Experiments of Vegeta|tion. He begins his 0 at the fir&s;t De|gree of Cold, or the freezing Point; and his la&s;t Degree of Heat is that in which melted Wax, &s;wimming on hot Water, begins to coagulate; the Space between tho&s;e two Extremes he divides into 100 Degrees, ju&s;tly reckoning that a Heat which keeps Wax fluid, is too &s;trong for Vegetation. Human Heat can expand the Spirit of Wine 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">0, when the Air is in a freezing Condition.</P>
<P N="5">V. By Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s Thermometer the Heat of animal Blood is to that of boil|ing Water, as 14 3/11 to 33. By the &s;ame Thermometer the Heat of the Skin is 54 Degrees of the 100, the Point at which Wax begins to coagulate, and is &s;omewhat more than that of Water in which you can put your Hand. This Heat no Vegetable can bear, at lea&s;t in this Climate; tho' I remember Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> mentions Heat in &s;ome Country which melts Wax, which is un&s;upportable by Human Bodies, and yet Vegetables &s;ur|vive it. By <HI>Hales</HI>'s Thermometer, the Heat of Milk from the Cow is 55, of
<PB N="47" REF="60">
Urine 58; that of an extreme hot Day was 88; a common Sun&s;hine Day at Noon, in <HI>July,</HI> 50; in the Shade 38; of a <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June</HI> Day from 17 to 30, the mo&s;t temperate for Vegetation, and therefore the propere&s;t perhaps for Hu|man Bodies. What was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing was the Heat of 88, which exceeding 54, the natural animal Heat, Human Creatures could not have endured it long. He told me that it was extreme|ly hot for a while, and his Thermometer &s;tood in the Sun.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Rarity of the Air makes it more &s;en&s;ible of the Changes of Heat and Cold, than any other Fluid. The &s;malle&s;t Increa&s;e of Heat expands it, and the Abatement of that contracts it im|mediately in all its Parts: The Heat of boiling Water, as was mentioned before, expands it &frac13;. The Degrees of Expan|&s;ion of the Air are not determinable, for the greate&s;t Degree of Heat will not totally expel it; but by this continual Contractibility and Dilatibility, by dif|ferent Degrees of Heat, the Air is kept in a con&s;tant Motion. The different Degrees of Heat create a proportional Expan&s;ion of Liquors, &s;o as to make a &s;en&s;ible Alteration in their &s;pecifick Gravity; that of rectify'd Spirit of Wine
<PB N="48" REF="61">
about the Pole makes the Difference of 1/9 of its Bulk, and con&s;equently of its Price, bought by Mea&s;ure: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boerhaave.</NOTE> Mercury can be condens'd by Cold, &s;o as to be as heavy as Gold: By Heat, the Air contain'd in animal Fluids is expanded; for Gla&s;s Bubbles in any Fluid, ri&s;e and fall with the Changes of Heat, as well as by tho&s;e of the Gravity of the Air.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A certain Degree of Heat, not &s;trong enough to dry or de&s;troy animal Solids, lengthens and relaxes the Fi|bres; from whence proceed the Sen&s;ation of Fainti&s;hne&s;s and Debility in a hot Day; the Effect above-mentioned of Relaxation of the Fibres, and Expan|&s;ion of the Fluids by Heat, are evident to the Sight and Touch, for the out|ward Parts of Human Bodies &s;well and are plumper in hot Weather than in cold. There are many Experiments which demon&s;trate the &s;ame thing, need|le&s;s to be in&s;erted.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Air extremely hot is capable of reducing animal Sub&s;tances to a State of Putrefaction, and is particularly hurtful to the Lungs. Blood is cooler in the Veins than in the Arteries, and returns
<PB N="49" REF="62">
to the right Ventricle of the Heart, where it is &s;till render'd cooler by a fre&s;h Mixture of Chyle, which is cooler than Blood; but by the Circulation through the Lungs it is heated again to a Degree, &s;o as to render it &s;pu|mous. The Surface of the Ve&s;icles of the Lungs is expos'd to the outward Air, which has a free Admittance to it. Refrigeration by cool Air is one, tho' not the principal U&s;e of Air in Re&s;pi|ration; but when this outward Air is ma|ny Degrees hotter than the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troy and putrify both the Solids and Fluids: And this is found true by an Experi|ment; for in a Sugar-Baker's Drying-Room, where the Air was heated 146, or 54 beyond that of a Human Body, a Sparrow died in two Minutes, a Dog in 28 Minutes; but the mo&s;t remarka|ble thing of all was, that the Dog void|ed a red <HI>Saliva,</HI> foetid and putrid. We owe this luciferous Experiment to the indu&s;trious <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> from which ma|ny important Inferences may be drawn; for why might not this putrid <HI>Saliva</HI> of the Dog be infectious? Con&s;equent|ly it is po&s;&s;ible for pe&s;tilential Di&s;tem|pers to begin from exce&s;&s;ive Heats; no Human Creature can live long in
<PB N="50" REF="63">
an Air hotter than their own Bo|dies.</P>
<P N="9">IX. There are &s;ome Experiments which &s;eem to indicate that Air, heated to a certain Degree beyond that of boil|ing Water cool'd again, and retaining all its common Properties of Gravity, Ela&s;ticity, lo&s;eth &s;omething, &s;o as to render it unfit for Re&s;piration: But I am apt to believe, with the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> that in the Experiments which were made, the Air was infected with the poi&s;onous Steams of the Bo|dies through which it pa&s;s'd in heat|ing; for the Air that pa&s;&s;ed through hot Gla&s;s did not kill Animals, as that which pa&s;&s;ed through Charcoal: But however, it is certain that Air heated with &s;ulphureous Steams of Candles or animal Bodies, lo&s;eth &s;ome Part of its Ela&s;ticity, and becomes unfit for a|nimal Functions, &s;uch as the Air in which People of Fa&s;hion pa&s;s a great deal of their time; but of this more af|terwards.</P>
<P N="10">X. Another great Effect of the Heat of the Air upon Human Bodies is, that by the Degrees of it the Quantity of Per&s;piration, &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible, is regulated. By Journals that have been kept it appears, that the Per&s;piration of
<PB N="51" REF="64">
<HI>England</HI> &s;carcely equals all the other Excretions, and that the Summer Per|&s;piration is near double to that of Win|ter; whereas in <HI>Paduan</HI> Air, the Per|&s;piration the Year round is to all the o|ther Excretions as 5 to 3, and perhaps in hotter Countries the Proportion is greater. This mu&s;t occa&s;ion a great Variety of Human Con&s;titutions and Di&s;ea&s;es, according to different Climates. The &s;erous Part of the Blood being carried off by Sweat or &s;en&s;ible Per&s;pi|ration, which is much greater in hot Countries than in cold or temperate, mu&s;t make the <HI>Craffamentum</HI> or red Cake of the Blood more; and a Phy&s;i|cian who has practis'd in tho&s;e Coun|tries, has a&s;&s;ur'd me that the Ca&s;e is &s;o, that the Blood is commonly black and den&s;e when drawn. I have often been &s;urpris'd that the Quantities of Spices, which the Inhabitants of hot Countries take, do not hurt them; but on the other hand I con&s;ider, that Nature is wi&s;e, and had not made tho&s;e Plants in|digenous, unle&s;s they were u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps for attenuating the Blood depriv'd of its Fluidity by the great Quantity of &s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration; and to recruit it with the volatile and oily Parts of which it is depriv'd,

<P N="11">XI. I would likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, That the real Quantity of animal Pluid car|ried off by Per&s;piration, can never be known by Ponderation; for as it is plain that the outward Air enters the Pores of the Body, and is &s;ometimes imbib'd or ab&s;orb'd by the Animal, the Quan|tity of per&s;pirable Matter is only the Difference of the Exce&s;s of that be|yond the Quantity of Air that is imbib'd; of this more in the following Part of this Chapter.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Winds do not cool the Air by their Motion, but by bringing along with them the Air of cooler Regions. The Thermometer does not change by Winds, nor by the &s;tronge&s;t Bla&s;t of a Bellows, unle&s;s it be blown through Ice, or any Body colder than the Air, and &s;uch a Bla&s;t will &s;ink it. The rapid Motion of great Storms rather agitates and heats the Air; but Winds cool ani|mal Bodies by driving away the hot Steam that &s;urrounds them: Suppo&s;e the Heat of an animal Body to be 90, and the Heat of the Air 48, the animal Body by blowing off the hot Steam will be &s;urrounded with an Atmo&s;phere of 48, near the Half of its natural Heat,

taken off in a Second of Time; there|fore re&s;ting in a cool Air after Exer|ci&s;e may be the Cau&s;e of great Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially &s;uch as affect the Lungs, In|flammations, A&s;thmas, Catarrhs; this Change of their Atmo&s;phere happening, as was &s;aid, every Second of Time, is the &s;ame thing as putting on a cold Suit of Clothes every &s;uch time.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. On the other hand, as Human Bodies can be cool'd by Air cooler than their own Temperature, perhaps &s;ooner than by any other Means, there is great U&s;e to be made of temperating feveri&s;h Heat by outward Air, &s;o that it be done with Safety; this is known by Experience in inflammatory Di&s;tempers, as in the Small-pox. No Liquor taken inwardly can cool Human Blood &s;o &s;oon as cool Air. Boiling Water is reduc'd to its own Temperature in a &s;hort time, by cool Air. Two Liquors of equal Den&s;ity, and unequal Degrees of Heat, being mix'd in equal Quantities, re|duce the Heat of the Whole imme|diately to half the Sum; for Example, boiling Water hot as 212 Pound, to an equal Quantity of Water cold, as 32, makes the Heat of the whole (212&plus;32)/2=114. A Liquor of le&s;s Den&s;ity, &s;uch as Air,
<PB N="54" REF="67">
is indeed longer in producing this Ef|fect; and Air cools the Blood by its Contact or Admi&s;&s;ion into the Surface of the Skin, or the Lungs. Innumera|ble Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;e from keeping the Air of the Room of a feveri&s;h Per&s;on too hot, by depriving the Patient of the Benefit of Refrigeration by cool Air; from the bad Effects of animal Steams, which &s;poil the Air, and de|&s;troy its Ela&s;ticity, as will appear by what is &s;aid afterwards, it is known by Experience that Patients in Fevers affect cool Air, and will u&s;e their utmo&s;t Ef|forts to come at it, even by getting out of Bed. I am of Opinion that renew|ing and cooling the Air in a Patient's Room, giving it a free Admi&s;&s;ion by o|pening the Door, the Bed-Curtains, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es the Windows, or letting it in by Pipes, changing the hot At|mo&s;phere about him, &s;o as not to di&s;|appoint the Intention of keeping up a due Quantity of Per&s;piration; and in ge|neral, the right Management of the Air is one of the chief Branches of a Re|gimen in inflammatory Di&s;tempers; and by the &s;crupulous Care of &s;illy Nur&s;es in this Particular, the Di&s;ea&s;e is often increas'd, lengthen'd, and proves fatal; and this Error is &s;till more dangerous

<P N="14">XIV. The Effects of cold Air may be inferr'd from what has been &s;aid of hot Air; Cold being a Privation or A|batement of &s;o many Degrees of Heat, induceth a proportional Diminution of the Effects of Heat or contrary Quali|ties. Cold Air is the immediate Cau&s;e of Freezing; it fir&s;t begins in the Air by Congelation of the watery Particles in it; and the Effects of this Cold &s;ome|times do not reach &s;o far as the Sur|face of the Earth, &s;o as to freeze the Water on it; as in Summer Hail, and Icy Showers, &s;uch as that which fell in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI> in 1672: &s;o de&s;tructive of Vegetables, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Abridgment</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. II. p. 152.</NOTE> the Sur|face of the Earth was not frozen. In <HI>Farenheit</HI>'s Thermometer Freezing be|gins at 32, and increa&s;ing, will &s;ink the Spirit of Wine to o, which is a De|gree &s;carcely &s;upportable by animal Bo|dies: Artificial Freezing will &s;ink it below that Point. Vegetables endure greater Degrees of Cold than Animals,
<PB N="56" REF="69">
and yet great De&s;truction is made of them by Winter's Cold &s;ometimes, as that of 1684, and in &s;ome Countries 1708; becau&s;e Human Creatures have Defences again&s;t the Injuries of the Air.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Cold conden&s;eth the Air pro|portional to the Degrees of it; it con|tracts animal Fibres and Fluids, which are den&s;er as far as the Cold reacheth. In cold Weather Animals are really of le&s;s Dimen&s;ions. Cold braceth the Fi|bres not only by its conden&s;ing Quality, but likewi&s;e by congealing the Moi&s;ture of the Air, which relaxeth. Extreme Cold works on Human Bodies as a <HI>Sti|mulus,</HI> producing at fir&s;t a pricking Sen|&s;ation, and afterwards a glowing Heat, or a &s;mall Degree of an Inflammation in the Parts of the Body which are ex|po&s;ed to it. By bracing of the Fibres more &s;trongly, conden&s;ing the Fluids, and &s;timulating, it produceth Strength and Activity, which is very &s;en&s;ible to &s;ome in clear fro&s;ty Weather. If the Effects of cold Air are &s;o con&s;iderable upon the outward Surface of the Body, they may be much more &s;o upon the Loogs, in which the Blood is much hotter, and the Coat very thin, in im|mediate Contact with the outward Air;
<PB N="57" REF="70">
and were it not that the warm Air is not intirely expell'd in Expiration, the Contact of the cold Air would be in|tolerable; and indeed the Effect of cold Air in producing Inflammations of the Lungs is very &s;en&s;ible, e&s;pecially upon the blowing of cold North-we&s;terly Winds in &s;ome of our Northern Planta|tions in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Cold conden&s;eth all Fluids, except Water, which it ra|rifies to 1/9 of more Bulk; Ice emergeth &s;o much out of Water: As Fro&s;t &s;e|parates Air from Water, and collects it into Bubbles, it may be &s;u&s;pected that the &s;mall &s;pecifick Gravity of Ice is not owing to invi&s;ible Ma&s;&s;es of Air in the Ice; for Air &s;eparated from any Liquor takes up a greater Space than in the Liquor, and con&s;equently renders the &s;ame Aggregate of Air, and Water &s;pe|cifically lighter. Perhaps this may &s;olve the Difficulties Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> had about this Matter. Freezing Cold contracts all o|ther Liquors be&s;ides Water, as oleagi|nous Liquors and Spirits, as to make them &s;pecifically heavier; Air, it will conden&s;e 1/10.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Cold, by contracting the Fibres of the Skin, and cooling the Blood too much in tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which are ex|po&s;ed to the Air, &s;uppre&s;&s;eth &s;ome of

feldom pierceth above the Depth of 10 Feet. The Air in the Grotto of the Ob&s;ervatory of <HI>Paris,</HI> of 130 Foot deep, is equable and temperate: There is a certain Di&s;tance at which the na|tural Heat of the Earth is not de&s;troy'd by the outward Air. Fro&s;t in &s;uch a Degree as does not congeal animal Flu|ids, may increa&s;e in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration. Liquors lo&s;e their volatile Parts in fro&s;ty Weather more than in hot, by con|den&s;ing the watery Parts, the Volatile fly off. Scents are not abared by Cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Memoirs de l'Academ. de Science, 1709.</NOTE>, but, as I &s;aid before, &s;ome of the gro&s;|&s;er Salts are retain'd in Per&s;piration.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Extreme Cold and extreme Heat de&s;troy or reduce to a gangrenous State animal Sub&s;tances, with this Dif|ference, that the Cold which produceth Mortifications in living Bodies, pre&s;erves the Dead from Putrefaction; for there mu&s;t be a Concurrence of Heat and Motion in the animal Juices with the <HI>Stimulus</HI> of the Cold, to produce the Change; we cannot rai&s;e a Bli&s;ter on a dead Body.</P>

by them, are nece&s;&s;ary for the Oeconomy of Animals and Vegetables, but neither can bear the Extremities of them. In all Probability the &s;ame De|gree of Heat has per&s;i&s;ted about the Earth ever &s;ince the Creation; the Cau&s;es which produce it are the &s;ame. Ani|mals and Vegetables have been produc'd, and continued to grow after the &s;ame manner, which is a Sign that the Heat has wrought after an uniform manner, and that the Quantity of it upon the Surface of the Earth has continued the &s;ame; it may be increas'd in particular Places, but when the <HI>Pabulum</HI> which produc'd it is con&s;um'd, there is no more Heat communicated to the re&s;t of the Matter. There does not &s;eem to be any natural Cau&s;e for the Increa&s;e of Heat on the Body of the Earth, unle&s;s it be the Approach of a Comet. The Spots that appear and di&s;appear on the Surface of the Sun, can make no great Altera|tion.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. As to the Degrees of Heat, a Heat of 90, by <HI>Farenheit's</HI> Thermometer, turns the White of an Egg liquid, &s;anious, and putrid; a Heat of 200 will harden it. Vegetable Heat, in which Plants will live or grow, is from 1 to 80; a|nimal Heat, terre&s;trial, from 40 to 94;

of Fi&s;hes that have Gills 34, and which can bear Heat to 60; but Fi&s;hes which have Lungs can bear Heat from 34 to 94. Water begins to grow hot at 94, and boils at 212. 600 is a melting Heat. A catoptrical or dioptrical Heat is &s;upe|rior to any, vitrifying the harde&s;t Sub|&s;tances.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The Effects of Moi&s;ture on the Air, both on Animals and Vegetables, are Relaxation of their Fibres; by ma|ny Experiments I have found that the &s;ingle Fibres, both of Vegetables and Ani|mals, are lengthened by Water or by moi&s;t Air; a Fiddle-&s;tring moi&s;ten'd with Water will &s;ink a Note in a little time, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be relaxed or lengthened 1/16; the Steam of hot Wa|ter will &s;ink it a Note in 5 or 6 Mi|nutes. That Moi&s;ture relaxeth is evi|dent by daily Experience, of Paper, Vel|lum, a Drum, Leather. Vegetable or animal Fibres fir&s;t moi&s;ten'd, and after|wards dry'd, contract more than before they were moi&s;ten'd. It mu&s;t happen indeed that Water, in&s;inuated into the Pores of any Body, increa&s;eth its Dimen|&s;ions; and perhaps by this Mechani&s;m it &s;hortens Ropes, by increa&s;ing their Thickne&s;s. A cold Bath makes a mo|mentary Contraction of the Fibres by
<PB N="62" REF="75">
the Cold, and the Sen&s;ation of which in live Bodies works as a <HI>Stimulus;</HI> but the Water it&s;elf would relax, and con|&s;tantly does &s;o, when its Degree of Heat is equal to that of our Bodies, and con|tinuing long in cool Water, at la&s;t re|laxeth. Swimming long di&s;pirits more by the Relaxation of the Water, than Exerci&s;e. Water and Air produce Vo|latility or Putrefaction in Bodies, and &s;till in a greater Degree if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Heat. Moi&s;ture helps Air to in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the Pores of Bodies. A Blad|der will &s;ooner bur&s;t than let Air pa&s;s when dry, but when moi&s;ten'd lets it ea|&s;ily pa&s;s. Moi&s;ture dimini&s;heth the Ela|&s;ticity of the Air; in rainy Weather the Air is le&s;s ela&s;tick. Thus Moi&s;ture re|laxeth Human Fibres, by weakening the Spring of the Air. Dry Air either abates tho&s;e Effects, or produceth their Con|traries. Dry Air &s;ucks up the volatile Oils of animal Bodies, by which means it influenceth Per&s;piration. Freezing Cold &s;eparates Air from Water; for as the Water freezeth, the Air appears in Bub|bles, which are &s;ometimes inclos'd in Ice.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. To the Relaxation of the Fibres by moi&s;t Air, are owing a great many Symptoms which Human Bodies feel in
<PB N="63" REF="76">
moi&s;t Weather (by which Relaxation they lo&s;e &s;ome of their Ela&s;ticity or Force for circulating the Fluids) e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e Aches and Pains which they feel in tho&s;e Parts where the Circulation of the Juices is not perfect, as in Cica|trices of Wounds, luxated or brui&s;ed Parts. I wi&s;h I could thoroughly un|der&s;tand the Cau&s;e of a Corn's aching before Rain, from which I &s;hould be able to explain the Cau&s;es of all tho&s;e Pains which affect &s;ome Bodies in wet Weather.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. Moi&s;t Air is properly that which is overcharg'd with Vapours near the Sur|face of the Earth; and when tho&s;e Va|pours are rather in a falling than an a&s;|cending State, the Body of Air may contain more Water in it at other times; but, as was &s;aid before, the Water and Air are better mix'd, the Vapours are higher, and a le&s;s Quantity of them in Contact with our Bodies; we call Air in &s;uch a State, dry; the Air may be &s;aid to be &s;ometimes in a State of imbibing, and &s;ometimes in a State of precipitating its Water.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. The Effects of dry Air are contrary to the&s;e of moi&s;t, becau&s;e they are an Abatement or Privation of them. Dry Air imbibes volatile animal Oils and
<PB N="64" REF="77">
Spirits, and con&s;equently influences Per|&s;piration. Great Dryne&s;s may change the very Texture and Situation of the Pores of the Skin. Of the two, extreme dry Sea&s;ons have proved more dan|gerous to Human Bodies than wet. Our Bodies are not made to bear Ex|tremities of any kind, but extreme Droughts have been found mo&s;t dan|gerous to Human Bodies. All the&s;e fore|mention'd Properties and Qualities of the Air, Gravity, Ela&s;ticity, Heat, Cold, Moi&s;ture, Dryne&s;s, act in their &s;everal Combinations on Human Bodies; and when their Actions con&s;pire, the Effect produced is the Sum; when contrati|wi&s;e, the Effect is the Difference of their Actions.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Air, by the Properties and Qualities enumerated, mu&s;t produce ve|ry &s;en&s;ible Changes in Human Bodies, becau&s;e it not only operates by outward Contact, but we con&s;tantly imbibe it at all the Pores of the Body, which is evi|dent by what has been &s;aid before; for if the Air had not a con&s;tant Admittance into the Body, how could the Balance of the external Air, and that within the Ve&s;&s;els, be &s;o quickly re&s;tor'd; upon this the Life of the Animal depends, to balance the Air within and without the Body;
<PB N="65" REF="78">
it requires indeed &s;ome time in de&s;cending in the Diving-Bell: there is one trouble|&s;om Sen&s;ation, and it is a &s;trong Pre&s;|&s;ure upon the Membrane of the Ear, where it has not &s;o ready an Admittance; but changing the Den&s;ity of the Air not too fa&s;t, by the free Communication of the den&s;er outward Air and that of the Body, there is no Danger nor unea&s;y Sen&s;ation. The Skin of an Animal dry'd, or Leather, excludes Air; but the Skins of live Animals are moi&s;t and oily, through which Air will pa&s;s. Where|ever there are Emi&s;&s;aries, there are like|wi&s;e ab&s;orbing Ve&s;&s;els. Many Bodies den&s;er than Air, as Mercury, Cantha|rides, Garlick, enter the Pores of the Skin. While we per&s;pire, we ab&s;orb the outward Air, and the Quantity of per|&s;pired Matter found by Ponderation, is only the Difference between that and the Air imbib'd; &s;o that after great Labour and Ab&s;tinence, which produces a Va|cuity, and a great Diminution of Per|&s;piration, it is po&s;&s;ible that the Quanti|ty of the Air ab&s;orb'd may exceed the per&s;pired Matter: This is true, if the Journals of Per&s;piration be faithful. In Dr. <HI>Keil</HI>'s Journal there is an In&s;tance of a Per&s;on growing 18 Ounces more ponderous by ab&s;orbing Air. The Peo|ple
<PB N="66" REF="79">
of <HI>Newmarket,</HI> who try the Methods of Wa&s;ting, a&s;&s;irm this to be true; tho' I own I &s;hould be very glad to have it confirm'd by &s;ome faithful Trial. <HI>Hippo|crates</HI> and <HI>Galen</HI> took the Doctrine of ab&s;orbing of Air for granted, and rea&s;on from it. This Quality of generating Air, and ab&s;orbing it at different times, has been demon&s;trated by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> in many Bodies, e&s;pecially in Vegetables, by plain Experiments; by which it appears that Air enters freely through the Bark, Steam, and Leaves, and all the outward Surface of Vege|tables, which are &s;ometimes not in a State of Per&s;piring, but in a State of imbibing Air, as in the Night. Another very re|markable thing is, that Air pa&s;&s;eth ea&s;ier through the Barks of old Trees than of young. <HI>Q.</HI> If by Dryne&s;s, Shrinking, and Hardening, the Pores of the Skins of old People may not grow wider? They are indeed more coreacous, but Air pa&s;&s;eth through dry Membranes when moi&s;ten'd. By an Experiment of the in|genious Profe&s;&s;or <HI>My&s;&s;chenberg,</HI> it appears that Air tran&s;mitted through clavellated A&s;hes into an exhau&s;ted Receiver, lo&s;es Weight as it pa&s;&s;es through them, and more or le&s;s, according to the Degree of Moi&s;ture in the Air. Volatile Salts, &s;uch
<PB N="67" REF="80">
as tho&s;e of Animals, do not generate, but ab&s;orb Air; and it is very probable that Human Bodies ab&s;orb the Water from the moi&s;t Air, as fixt, dry, alka|line Salts do; which will explain a great many Symptoms ari&s;ing from cold and moi&s;t Air. Many great Effects mu&s;t follow, and many &s;udden Changes may happen in Human Bodies, by ab|&s;orbing outward Air with all its Qua|lities and Contents; nothing accounts more clearly for epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es &s;eizing Human Creatures inhabiting the &s;ame Tract of Earth, who have nothing in common that affects them, except Air; &s;uch as that epidemical Catarrhous Fever of 1728, and of this pre&s;ent Year; it could not proceed merely from the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Per&s;piration by Cold, the Weather having been felt colder at other times; be&s;ides, it is known by Expe|rience, that the mere Suppre&s;&s;ion of Per|&s;piration does not always produce a Ca|tarrh, nor that keeping it up prevents one; it &s;eems rather to be occa&s;ion'd by Effluvia, uncommon either in Quantity or Quality, infecting the Air.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IV. Of the Nature of Air in different Situa|tions, Regions, and Sea&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AFTER having &s;aid &s;omething of the Contents, Properties, and Qualities of Air in general, and their Effects; it behoves us to take notice of its local and temporary Qualities, which may be deduc'd not only by Conjecture, but demon&s;trative Rea&s;on, from what has been &s;aid before. As to the Con|tents of Air, it is evident that they mu&s;t differ according to the Nature of the &s;urface of the Earth or Water from which they exhale; and this Difference would be permanent in every Spot of the Surface of the terraqueous Globe, did not the whole Ma&s;s of Air com|municate as a Fluid, and were not its Parts agitated and mix'd together by the Motion of Winds and other Methods of the wi&s;e Author of Nature: Yet the Mixture is not &s;o perfect but it leaves &s;ome Difference in the Nature of the Air, &s;en&s;ible to the Inhabitants of the &s;ame Tract of Ground where the Exhalations are con&s;tant, and con&s;tantly mix'd with the Air. Dew is the Exha|lation
<PB N="69" REF="82">
of the Earth, return'd again, and precipitated upon it; con&s;equently the Nature and Contents of the Dew of any Place, &s;eem to be the be&s;t Mark of the Exhalations of the Soil of that Place. Dew, by Chymical Trials, yields different Contents, according to Places, as the Soil is watery, &s;alt, unctuous, &s;a|line, mineral; and differs according to the Quantity of Heat by which it is rais'd, either from the Sun, or inward from the Earth. The local Qualities of the Air are more permanent in Calms, than in Winds: This is evident from Fogs, which are the Con&s;equence of Calms; therefore the Air retains its lo|cal Qualities long in Mines, Grottos, Ditches, not perflated; and in Valleys longer than on the Tops of Moun|tains.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Exhalations from great Sur|faces of Water, as the Sea, are &s;carce|ly any thing but Water, the Sun nei|ther acting upon the bottom, nor ex|haling the Salt. Winds rai&s;e &s;ome of the Salt with the Spray, as has been known by Experience in great Storms; the Bars of Windows, and Iron, ex|pos'd to the Sea Air, are apt to ru&s;t; this Salt is not unfriendly to Human Con&s;titutions, but the great Ma&s;s of Ex|halation
<PB N="70" REF="83">
is fre&s;h Water; and were it not for con&s;tant Winds which blow off the Coat of Vapours which inve&s;ts the Sea, I am of opinion that Sea Air would be intolerable to Human Bodies.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Contents of the Air mu&s;t differ much in Fro&s;t, and open Weather: Great Fro&s;ts &s;top the Per&s;piration of the Earth, and con&s;equently deprive the Air of the Ingredients of tho&s;e Exhalations; accordingly, it has been found by Ex|perience, that when there are noxious Exhalations in the Air, the Ca&s;e perhaps of pe&s;tilential Sea&s;ons, that they have been &s;topt by Fro&s;t: Fro&s;t congeals and &s;eparates the Water from Air. On the other hand, in Thaws, the Per&s;piration of the Earth being re&s;tor'd, and its Ex|halations more copious, frequently ren|der &s;uch Sea&s;ons unhealthy; &s;uch was the Con&s;titution preceeding the la&s;t Plague of <HI>London,</HI> a hard Winter, &s;udden Thaw, a great Quantity of Water upon the Ground, attended with Heat; &s;uch an Air could not mi&s;s to produce great Sickne&s;s, wherein Mankind liv'd as it were in a wet Cellar, with a great Fire. Summer Air differs con&s;iderably from that of Winter, from the Air's being re|plete with the per&s;pirable Matter of Ve|getables. Rains, after great Droughts,
<PB N="71" REF="84">
mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, produce the &s;ame Effect as Thaws after great Fro&s;ts. The Air of Cities differs from Country Air, for many Rea&s;ons. <HI>See</HI> Numb. VIII. XI. Chap. I.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Contents of the Air of any Place differ according to its Situation, in re&s;pect of adjacent Places, from whence the Air is brought by Winds: A high Ground, dry, and naturally healthy, bor|dering upon low mar&s;hy Ground, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ickly, when the Winds blow over tho&s;e Mar&s;hes; be&s;ides, high Grounds attract Vapours as they ri&s;e from low Grounds. In choo&s;ing Situations, not only the Nature of the Soil on which you build, but the Nature of the neigh|bouring Grounds and Soil is to be con&s;i|dered.</P>
<P N="5">V. A rich fertile Soil, abounding with Variety of active, volatile, and unctuous Particles, with a con&s;iderable Degree of Heat, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce inflamma|tory Di&s;tempers in Human Bodies; &s;uch are rich Meadow Grounds, upon the Banks of Rivers, which, with the in|crea&s;ing Heat of the Spring, bring Fe|vers, e&s;pecially intermitting: Such rich Grounds, in very hot Climates, are ex|tremely unhealthy, as we find by the Re|lations of Travellers.

a gravelly Soil, on the Banks of a run|ning Stream, is generally healthy.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Mountainous Places abound with watery Vapours. Hills attract Vapours; Woods attract Vapours, and &s;top the Per|flation by Winds; yet chalky and gravel|ly high Grounds which have no unwhol|&s;om Per&s;piration, nor are in the neigh|bourhood of mar&s;hy and low Grounds, are generally healthy.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Both the &s;uperficial Effluvia of the Earth, and tho&s;e of Minerals, which lie lower, affect the Air, as is known by Experience: People who pa&s;s over Ground abounding with Mines are &s;en&s;i|ble of offen&s;ive Steams. The <HI>Averni</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> kill Animals, and al&s;o Birds that fly over them. Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> is of Opi|nion that more Places abound with Mi|nerals, e&s;pecially Marca&s;ites, than are &s;u&s;pected. Minerals mu&s;t needs affect the Air, when they enter the very Sub&s;tance of Plants, of which there are very few that have not Iron in them.

<P N="8">VIII. The Methods which Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> advi&s;eth for di&s;covering what Salts are in the Air, are, to expo&s;e &s;uch Bodies as are affected with tho&s;e Salts; as dy'd Silks of particular Colours, which will be tar|ni&s;h'd with nitrous Salts: Preparations of Sulphur are blacken'd with vitriolick Salts; to try what Alterations are made upon white Linen, freed from Sope and Lye, by Steams or Dews; Experiments of Bodies di&s;coloured, or otherwi&s;e af|fected by different Spirits; Spirit of Ni|tre makes with Copper, a pali&s;h Blue; Spirit of Salt, a Green; Spirit of Urine, a deep Blue. In &s;ome Places, as in <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> Plate tarni&s;hes &s;oon. The Cop|per-Mines in <HI>Sweden</HI> affect the Silver that is near them, and make it black. In
<PB N="74" REF="87">
&s;ome Places Furniture rots, Metals ru&s;t. But I think there is no better way of judging of the Air of any Place, than by the Water which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily im|bibe the Salts, Sulphurs, and other Mi|nerals, through which it flows; and when it is free from any Savour from tho&s;e Sub&s;tances, it is probable the Ground is &s;o too. Sulphurous Steams, ari&s;ing by &s;ubterraneous Heats, whiten the Waters of Springs, and are certain Pro|gno&s;ticks of an Earthquake; and I think it may be concluded, that where the Water is good, the Air is &s;o likewi&s;e. Sulphur in the Air may be di&s;cover'd by Smell, as is perceiv'd in Vulcanos and Storms. Sulphureous Airs may be fir'd with a Candle.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Moi&s;ture in the Air is di&s;cover'd by Hygro&s;copes: And an Air naturally moi&s;t di&s;covers it &s;elf by its Effects upon Furniture, Plate, and &s;everal other Bo|dies; and is &s;ometimes to that Degree in Thaws after great Fro&s;ts, as to wet the Stair-ca&s;e, Wain&s;cot, Pictures, and other Furniture.</P>
<P N="10">X. As to the Gravity and Ela&s;ticity of the Air, they decrea&s;e with the Height, as was mention'd Chap. II. and it &s;eems almo&s;t incredible, that a Human Crea|ture can live at the bottom of a Mine,
<PB N="75" REF="88">
with the Mercury at 32 Inches high; and at the Top of a Mountain of three Miles, perpendicular Height, where the Mercury &s;tands at 16, that is, with the Weight of the Atmo&s;phere; in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e at 32000 Pounds, and in the &s;econd at 16000; perhaps there are &s;carcely any Human Creatures who re&s;ide con&s;tantly in tho&s;e Extremes; if there were &s;uch, there mu&s;t be a great Diver&s;ity of Con|&s;titutions and Di&s;ea&s;es; but a &s;maller Difference in the Weight of the Air, mu&s;t create a great Diver&s;ity of the Ef|fects of the Air, on the Inhabitants of tho&s;e different Regions.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Changes of the Gravity of the Air, affecting Human Bodies with o&s;cillatory Motions of the Solids and Flu|ids, the more frequent and great tho&s;e Changes are, the greater Effects they will have upon the Nerves and Spirits; but &s;o it is, that within the Tropicks, where there are no variable Winds, the Variations of the Height of the Mercu|ry are but &s;mall; from whence there mu&s;t ari&s;e a Diver&s;ity of Tempers and Con&s;titutions between the Inhabitants of &s;mall and great Latitudes, upon account of the greater Variablene&s;s of the Gravity of the Air: Of the&s;e Particulars we &s;hall &s;ay more afterwards</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="76" REF="89">
XII. The Air, by Ela&s;ticity, concur|ring with its Gravity, in&s;inuates it&s;elf into animal Bodies. There are Sub|&s;tances, which, mix'd with Air, abate and de&s;troy &s;ome of its Ela&s;ticity, e&s;pe|cially &s;ulphureous Steams, as tho&s;e of Candles, Animals, which render the Air unfit for Re&s;piration. The Air in which &s;uch Steams re&s;ide, is very different from pure Air.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Heat, as far as it depends upon the Action of the Sun, is men&s;urable in different Climates. The Quantities of it have been geometrically determin'd by Dr. <HI>Halley</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Abridgment</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. II. p. 169.</NOTE>: For Example, the Equi|noctial Heat under the Line, is to the Equinoctial Heat in 60 Degrees of Lati|tude, as 2 to 1; to that of the Latitude of 50, &s;omewhat le&s;s than 10 to 6. The Tropical Heat under the Line is le&s;s than in a Latitude of 50, nearly in the Propor|tion of 9 to 11. The Tropical Heat under the Line is the lea&s;t of any Situa|tion upon the Globe. The Tropical Heat under the Pole is greater than that un|der the Line, in the Proportion of 5 to 4; the Duration of the Sun above the Horizon, the whole 24 Hours, over|balancing the Difference of the Inclina|tions
<PB N="77" REF="90">
of its Rays. In all appearance, if there was no Sun, the Fluids above the Surface of the Earth, or within a cer|tain Depth of it, would be ab&s;olutely rigid and frozen, &s;o that there would be no Fluid at all; perhaps the Air it &s;elf, without the Action of the Sun, would not continue fluid. The Fluids are &s;o much frozen in great Latitudes, by the Ab&s;ence of the Sun, that the Quantity of Heat is not &s;ufficient, du|ring its Stay, to melt them and warm the Atmo&s;phere, which is kept cold by the Ice on the Surface of the Earth. Heat and Cold are retain'd longer in Bodies, in Proportion to their Den&s;ities.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. There is a Cru&s;t of &s;olid Ice round the Pole, perhaps for &s;ome De|grees, which, by a hard and cold Win|ter, may get more Ground than it lo&s;eth in the &s;ucceeding Summer, and, being carried by Winds, affects the Air of le&s;&s;er Latitudes with great Coldne&s;s. The Neighbourhood of great Bodies of Ice, produce in great Tracts of Land greater and more la&s;ting Degrees of Cold than are proportional to their La|titudes, and which never cea&s;e till that Ice is melted. The Cold in the Paral|lel of <HI>London</HI> is much greater in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The midland Countries of
<PB N="78" REF="91">
great Continents are colder than tho&s;e that have the Sea Air. <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> in the &s;ame Latitude with <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> is much colder.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The &s;ame Southern Latitudes are colder than the Northern, from an A&s;tronomical Cau&s;e, which, if the Rea|der does not under&s;tand, he may take it in this Light: The Time from the Ver|nal Equinox to the Autumnal, is 9 Days more than from the Autumnal to the Vernal; con&s;equently the Summer in our Hemi&s;phere is 9 Days longer than that of Southern Latitudes, which Cau&s;e, working a va&s;t Number of Years, mu&s;t heat our Hemi&s;phere more than the Southern. Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> met with a Sea unnavigable for Ice, in the Latitude of 51, in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> which is the &s;ame thing as Ice in our Seas in the Month of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. It is plain, that the Degrees of Heat in &s;everal Places of the Earth, bear no regular Proportion to the Action of the Sun, which is uniform. The great Diver&s;ity of Sea&s;ons in the &s;ame Place, may perhaps depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon &s;ome Action of the Sun upon the Earth, re&s;embling the Opera|tions of Chymi&s;try, rai&s;ing &s;ome &s;ubter|raneous Steams of different Qualities

and Quantities, at different times. In the Year, 775. it is reported by an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glycus.</NOTE>Hi|&s;torian, that the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> was fro|zen along the Coa&s;t to the Di&s;tance of 50 Leagues.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The Heat of the Air depends, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon the Con&s;titution and Temper of the Surface of the Earth, which in &s;ome Places retains Heat more than in others. Black Earth imbibes the Sun's Rays: Expo&s;e a black and a white marble Ball to the Sun Beams, in a clear hot Day, the white will be perfectly cool, while the black acquires a Heat that would ro&s;t an Egg. Sandy Ground, by reflecting the Sun-beams e|very way, heats the Air, is offen&s;ive to the Eyes; and, by the Heat of the Sand in &s;ome Countries, in&s;ufferable to the Feet. The Heat of the I&s;land of <HI>Or|mus,</HI> which lies beyond the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> is &s;o intolerable at &s;ome time of the Day, by the Reflexion of the Sun-beams from the white Mountains of Salt, that the Inhabitants are forc'd to im|merge them&s;elves in Water.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Hot Steams ri&s;ing from the Surface of the Earth, heat the contigu|ous Air. The Heat of particular Days
<PB N="80" REF="93">
depends &s;ometimes upon the Reflexion and Refraction of Sun-beams from Clouds, by the Laws of Catoptricks and Dioptricks. The greate&s;t Degree of Heat is producible by Attrition. The Parts abraded by the Attrition of Flint and Steel, are Gla&s;s, which is the utmo&s;t Effect of the Heat of a Burning-gla&s;s, and more quick: And it is po&s;&s;ible that the greate&s;t Degrees of Heat in the Air, as Storms and Thunder, may be produc'd by the Colli&s;ion and Fall of Icy Bodies in the Air.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The Heat decrea&s;eth with the Attitudes from the Surface of the Earth, it being le&s;s on the Tops of Mountains than in Valleys, becau&s;e the Air being a Fluid extremely rare, retains Heat but a &s;hort time. The Incidence of the Rays of the Sun, does not create any la&s;ting Heat in the Air. The Air, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the <HI>Focus</HI> of a Burning-gla&s;s, which vitrifies Metal, is not hotter than other Air. The Heat excited in the Air by the Rays of the Sun is immediately extingui&s;h'd by intercepting them. In a Green-hou&s;e, the Parts not touch'd by the reflected Rays of the Sun, grow rather cooler than outward Air. Den&s;e Bodies retain Heat, excited by Sun-beams a longer time, in Proportion to their
<PB N="81" REF="94">
Den&s;ity, the Air not the &s;malle&s;t In&s;tant, as on the Tops of Mountains, where it is de|priv'd of the Heat and Reflexion from the Surface of the Earth. In the middle of the Torrid Zone, in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> as you a&s;cend the Air grows &s;till cooler. The Tops of Mountains, in very hot Countries, are cover'd with Snow. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ludolph.</NOTE> As you a&s;cend from the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> in <HI>Aethio|pia,</HI> the Air grows &s;till more temperate, till on the Tops of Mountains it grows more un&s;ufferable than the Heat in the Valleys. It is by hot Air, and not by the Action of the Sun, that Ice melts. The Heat of the Sun, in a clear fro&s;ty Day, has but a &s;mall Effect upon a Surface of Ice. <HI>Jo&s;eph d'Aco&s;ta</HI> tells us, that the Air in one very high Mountain of <HI>Peru</HI> is mortal, at the fir&s;t Bla&s;t, and by its Coldne&s;s pre&s;erves the dead Bodies from Putrefaction. He tells us, that on the Top of the Mountain of <HI>Peru,</HI> per|haps the highe&s;t in the World, he and his Company were &s;eiz'd with bilious Vomitings, perhaps from the Thinne&s;s, as well as Coldne&s;s of the Air.</P>
<P N="20">XX. As the Air in higher Regions is colder, &s;o it &s;eems to begin there, and de|&s;cend towards the Surface of the Earth; it
<PB N="82" REF="95">
affects the Water at the Top fir&s;t, which, in extreme Fro&s;ts, will freeze to the Depth of 3 Inches in 24 Hours. The Suppo&s;ition of Fro&s;t being produc'd by nitrous Particles in the Air, is not well &s;upported; the Steams of Nitre have no greater Effects than tho&s;e of other &s;aline Liquors in producing Cold. Spi|rit of Nitre di&s;&s;olves Ice. In general, the Suppo&s;ition contradicts Experiments, where Nitre rather di&s;&s;olves Ice than pro|duceth it.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Mere Freezing is not the Mea|&s;ure of Cold, for it begins to freeze at 32; but the Cold may increa&s;e till it brings the rectify'd Spirit to o, a Cold in&s;ufferable by Human Bodies, and in which the mo&s;t &s;pirituous Liquors freeze: The &s;tronge&s;t Motion, and the greate&s;t artificial Heat by Fires, can hardly pre&s;erve Human Bodies from freezing. The natural Heat of a Human Body is 90, and it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Degrees of Heat between le&s;s than 90, and &s;omewhat a|bove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> As the Difference of the Gra|vity of the Air, which Human Bodies can &s;u&s;tain, is &s;urpri&s;ing; no le&s;s &s;o are the Limits of Heat and Cold &s;ufferable, by the help of Art and Cu&s;tom; in Cold to o, in the Thermometer; and in Heat beyond the Limits of 90 Degrees

mentioned. There are &s;ome Countries, as in <HI>Suagena,</HI> in which Wax is melt|ed tho' lock'd up in Cabinets; where Bodies in Summer are excoriated by Heat, as in Northern by Cold; Shoes are burnt as it were with a hot Iron: But Human Creatures mu&s;t have &s;ome Means of defending them&s;elves from tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Heats, el&s;e they could not live.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. As the Heat decrea&s;eth from the Surface of the Earth upwards, the Effects of Fro&s;t &s;carcely reach 10 Feet within the Surface, beyond that Depth the Heat is more uniform; the Ther|mometer, at the Depth of 130 Feet, &s;carcely varying, except from accidental Cau&s;es from Sub&s;tances within the Bow|els of the Earth. By the Relations of &s;ome who have gone down great Depths into the bottom of Mines, coming out of the warm Air de&s;cending a few Fa|thoms, they find them&s;elves colder; af|terwards the Heat increa&s;eth, as they go lower, &s;o that the Labourers are forc'd to work in &s;ome Mines without their Clothes; and no doubt this Heat is different, according to the Difference of tho&s;e Mineral Sub&s;tances. The Heat produc'd by the Action of the Sun in the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth, is longer
<PB N="84" REF="97">
in decrea&s;ing and increa&s;ing, than in the Air, or in the Surface; &s;o that the Sea|&s;ons within the Surface of the Earth do not begin &s;o &s;oon as in the open Air.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Great Alterations are produced in the Temperature of the Air, as to Heat and Cold, by Winds; not by their Motion, but as they blow over hot or cold Grounds, and mix Air of a hotter or colder Temper, with the Air of that Place, which, as they add or &s;ub&s;tract Degrees of Heat, produce half the Sum: For Example, Air, hot as 80, mixing with Air hot as 40, makes Air hot as 60; Air, hot as 30, mix'd with Air of 40, makes Air hot as 35. There are hot Winds in <HI>Africa,</HI> which blow over &s;andy De&s;arts, that kill even Elephants: On the other hand, a Northerly Wind, blowing at the moderate rate of 8 Miles an Hour, would bring the Air of the Pole to <HI>London</HI> in 12 Days; for this Rea&s;on, in hot Climates, on this &s;ide the Line, Northern Winds are whol&s;om, and Southerly Winds bring Di&s;ea&s;es. The Sickne&s;s and Health of the Inhabitants of <HI>Egypt,</HI> keep regular Periods with tho&s;e two Winds. The Air of any Place may be heated or cool'd to great Degrees, by Winds; for, as I ob&s;erv'd before,
<PB N="85" REF="98">
blowing with a Bellows the Air of the Room where the Thermometer &s;tands, neither rai&s;es nor &s;inks it; but if you blow through hot Metal or Ice, the fir&s;t rai&s;es and the &s;econd &s;inks it in a Moment. Winds cool Human Bodies, if they are cooler than the Atmo&s;phere of per&s;pirable Matter that &s;urrounds them, by blowing off that hotter At|mo&s;phere, and inve&s;ting the Body with one &s;omewhat cooler. The Sea and Land Breezes refre&s;h the Air of Countries within the torrid Zone, and are ex|tremely comfortable to the Inhabitants. Wherever the Air is extremely rarify'd by Heat, the neighbouring cooler Air ru&s;heth in to re&s;tore the Balance. The Nights in hot Countries are often very cold, and upon that Account extremely dangerous to the Health of &s;uch as ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to it. An Ea&s;terly Wind in this Country, blows fre&s;h after the Sun is down; and, after a hot Day, chills Human Bodies expos'd to it too much, often occa&s;ioning Fevers and other Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. In large Tracts of Land, there is a much greater Uniformity of the Weather than is commonly imagin'd; the Colds and Heats differ as to their Degrees, but begin and end much about
<PB N="86" REF="99">
the &s;ame time: This is confirm'd by Journals of the Weather kept at <HI>Up|min&s;ter, Zurich,</HI> and <HI>Paris;</HI> remarkable Changes of Weather happening at tho&s;e Places, near the &s;ame time. The Changes of the Gravity of the Air are yet more uniform; the Mercury, by Ob&s;ervations, ri&s;ing and falling about the &s;ame time at <HI>Paris, Upmin&s;ter, Dublin, Lanca&s;hire.</HI> The Winds likewi&s;e, when they are &s;trong, agree very well; when they are le&s;s violent, they differ, as depending upon local Cau&s;es. It appears likewi&s;e that the <HI>Alpine</HI> Snows have an Influence upon the Weather of <HI>England,</HI> as well as upon that of <HI>Zurich;</HI> the Weather being uniform in great Tracts of Grounds, makes the Di&s;ea&s;es uniform likewi&s;e, which we have of late &s;een by plain Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The Cold of &s;ome Winters in <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;ome Parts adjacent, parti|cularly 1708, has nearly equall'd, in its Effects, that of great Northern Lati|tudes, by de&s;troying &s;everal Animals, as Fi&s;hes, and &s;ome &s;orts of Birds, which continued &s;carce for &s;ome Years after|wards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Abridgment</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> Vol. I. p. 107.</NOTE>; but mo&s;t of all, Vegetables;

and yet did not produce any great Mortality among&s;t Mankind, becau&s;e of the artificial Defences Human Crea|tures u&s;e again&s;t extreme Cold: The Cau&s;es of tho&s;e great Excur&s;ions of the Sea&s;ons into the Extremes of Cold and Heat, are very ob&s;cure, but &s;eem ra|ther to depend upon Effluvia that ri&s;e out of the Earth, than the Action of hea|venly Bodies.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. As to Moi&s;ture and Dryne&s;s, as far as they affect Human Bodies, they are to be con&s;idered only in the Region of the Air in which we live and breathe; wherever there is a Cloud, there is moi&s;t Air, or what would feel &s;o to a Human Body; but if it is at &s;uch a Height as not to be contiguous, the Body is not affected with it.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. In dry Weather, the Water in the Air is intimately mix'd with it, and the Vapours being higher, do not af|fect Human Bodies with a Sen&s;ation of Moi&s;ture; but when watery Vapours a&s;|cend or de&s;cend in Ma&s;&s;es, then they affect Human Bodies, and probably are imbib'd with the Air, which feels more moi&s;t when the Water is de&s;cending, than a&s;cending; more when the Water is in &s;mall, than in great Drops; in meazling and &s;oaking Rains, than in great
<PB N="88" REF="101">
Showers: The Effects of Moi&s;ture are more &s;en&s;ible to Human Bodies before, than after great Showers.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The Quantity of Vapour rais'd, and the Quantity of Water pre|cipitated from the Air, as I ob&s;erved before, &s;eems to be pretty uniform the Year round, over the Surface of the ter|raqueous Globe, perhaps about 22 Inches deep over the whole; but from acci|dental Cau&s;es it differs con&s;iderably as to Quantity, in different Places, and in the &s;ame Place in different Years.

Hills attract Vapours; and the Valleys near mountainous Places have generally great Quantities of Rain. As to the Moi&s;ture and Dryne&s;s of Regions within the torrid Zone, the mo&s;t gene|ral Rule is, That the Rain is greate&s;t, when the Sun is neare&s;t; and the Drought the greate&s;t, when the Sun is mo&s;t oblique: This <HI>Jo&s;eph d' Aco&s;ta</HI> af|firms, tho' not without &s;ome Excep|tions. In our Climate, the mo&s;t copious Showers, with the bigge&s;t Drops, are in the Summer. Within the Tropick the rainy Sea&s;on is what they call their Winter. There is perhaps a greater Quantity of Rain falls between the Tro|picks, than in greater Latitudes. There are greater Rivers and Lakes, and by the greater Heat, greater Quantities of Va|pours are rais'd. This freer Circula|tion of Water balanceth the great Heat, which, without Moi&s;ture, would ren|der Human Bodies &s;ickly, and the
<PB N="90" REF="103">
Ground unfruitful. The Moi&s;ture of a Sea&s;on is not to be exactly e&s;timated by the Quantity of Rain; for many rainy Days (during which the Weather may be &s;aid to be moi&s;t) do not often produce &s;o great a Quantity of Rain, as one great Shower, &s;ucceeded by ma|ny dry Days; but the Changes wrought in Human Bodies are proportional to the Continuance of moi&s;t or dry Sea|&s;ons. The Quantity of Water falling upon any Tract of Ground, may be e|&s;timated by the Condition of the Springs: where they fall, to be &s;ure there has been wanting a &s;ufficient Quantity of Water from the Clouds to &s;upply them; and the Surface of the Earth is no doubt for that Rea&s;on dry|er, and &s;upplies a &s;maller Quantity of Vapours. There is &s;carce any better Mea&s;ure for the Moi&s;ture of the Sur|face of the Earth, the Quantity of Va|pours, and in general the Moi&s;ture of the Sea&s;on, than the Quantity of Wa|ter; and indeed this is, in Places under the Influence of variable Winds, very different in different Years; at <HI>Upmin|&s;ter,</HI> in the Year 1709, there fell of Rain more than 26 Inches; of Rain, in the Year 1714, le&s;s than 11&frac15; Inches, above the Difference of 2 to 1;

at <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Year 1693, there fell 24.18; in 1705, 14.82, a Difference of near 7 to 5.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the U&s;e and Effects of Air in Re|&s;piration.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. IN order to come at the cleare&s;t Light po&s;&s;ible in this Enquiry, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate Facts as they ap|pear by Experiments and Ob&s;ervations. All Animals live in Air or Water; or &s;ometimes in one, and &s;ometimes in the other; therefore they may be call'd, Aereal, Aquatick, or Amphibious. All Animals have &s;ome Organ by which they draw in and expel, by turns, &s;ome of the Fluid in which they live, by which the Aereal draw in Air, and the Aqua|tick Water: In the Aereal, this Organ is call'd Lungs; in Fi&s;hes, Gills. Fi&s;hes which &s;ometimes breathe Air, and can|not always live under Water, as the Cetaceous Kind, have Lungs, and not Gills.</P>
<P N="2">II. No Animal which has once made u&s;e of this reciprocal Motion of Lungs or Gills, can live any con&s;iderable time without continuing the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="3">III. Air is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Life of every Animal, Aquatick, as well as Aereal, that without it Life is extingui&s;h'd
<PB N="95" REF="108">
in more or le&s;s time, according to their different Structure.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fi&s;hes in the Air-pump, as the Air is drawn out of their Water, &s;well, emit Air-bubbles, &s;wim on their Backs, and at la&s;t die; but if fre&s;h Air be a|gain admitted before they are quite dead, the Symptoms vani&s;h, and they reco|ver. Some Fi&s;hes, as Carp, Tench, Eel, live longer in Air, than in Water with|out Air; &s;ome of the te&s;taceous and cru&s;taceous Kinds, live very long in an exhau&s;ted Recipient; Oy&s;ters have liv'd 24 Hours in an exhau&s;ted Recipient; a Craw-fi&s;h may be kill'd in one. Aqua|tick Animals live longer without Air than the Amphibious, and the Amphi|bious longer than the Aereal; and of the&s;e, &s;ome a longer, and &s;ome a &s;horter time, according to the Structure of their Lungs. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI></NOTE> A Duck holds out longer in an exhau&s;ted Receiver, than a Hen. A Viper can live 2&frac12; Hours in an exhau&s;t|ed Receiver; and a Frog as long; a Snake 10 Hours; when &s;ome of tho&s;e Animals &s;eem as they were dead, they revive upon the Readmi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h Air; but no Animal revives that has been kept in a perfect <HI>Vacuum.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="96" REF="109">
V. Young Animals live longer in the Air-pump than adult; a Kitling longer than a Cat; as a <HI>Foetus</HI> in the Mother's Belly, or newly excluded, may live with|out Air before it has breath'd.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Symptoms which Animals feel in an exhau&s;ted Receiver, do not all proceed from the extreme Rarity or Want of Air to breathe; but many of them from the Expan&s;ion of the Air in their Ve&s;&s;els, by taking off the in|cumbent Pre&s;&s;ure, which throws them into Convul&s;ions, from which they are reliev'd, as they emit Air out of their Bodies, as was ob&s;erv'd before; the Ba|lance between the outward Air, and that within the Animal, mu&s;t be pre|&s;erv'd; and if this Balance is too quick|ly chang'd for the Capacity of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Communication, between the external Air and the internal of the Animal, the Animal, during that time, mu&s;t &s;uffer. It was ob&s;erv'd, that a Hu|man Creature, changing its Situation by degrees, can live in Air differing one half in Den&s;ity; but in an exhau&s;ted Recipient, &s;inking the Mercurial Gage 16 Inches, would throw a Human Crea|ture into Convul&s;ions by the Suddenne&s;s of the Change. Drowning kills Aereal Animals by depriving them of Air; if
<PB N="97" REF="110">
the Air in Receivers could be exhau&s;ted all at once, Want of Air would kill in the &s;ame time as Drowning, which, in &s;ome Animals, is very &s;hort. Small Birds are kill'd by being kept under Water half a Minute; a Duck in 6 Minutes; yet even Water-fowl, tho' they can &s;tay under Water longer than other Birds, by Particularities in their Structure, they do not bear the Want of Air much longer than other Birds.</P>
<P N="7">VII. What is remarkable, not only in Re&s;piration, but may perhaps take place in other Qualities of the Air, That A&s;&s;uefaction, or being accu&s;tom'd, makes Animals &s;till endure tho&s;e Expe|riments better and better. A Duck, us'd to an exhau&s;ted Receiver, can en|dure it longer than a fre&s;h one. A|nother Fact, &s;ettled by a fair Experi|ment of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> is, that the Lungs of Animals that die <HI>in Vacuo,</HI> are &s;hrunk, and &s;ink in Water like the Lungs of a <HI>Foetus;</HI> yet the Lungs of an Animal that dy'd <HI>in Vacuo,</HI> being afterwards put into a Recipient, and the Air exhau&s;ted, &s;well.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. As no Animal can live with|out Air, &s;o none can live long in breath|ing the &s;ame individual Air. A Gal|lon
<PB N="98" REF="111">
of Air cannot &s;upply a Human Creature 1 Minute: By an Experiment of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> 74 cubical Inches of Air could not &s;upply him Half a Minute without Unea&s;ine&s;s, and not 1 Minute without Danger of Suf|focation; but if he had been &s;hut up with a proportional Quantity of Air, which con&s;equently mu&s;t have been &s;poil'd, not only by the Steams of the Lungs, but of the whole Body, the &s;ame Quantity would not have &s;upply'd him &s;o long a time.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The rarer the Air is, it is the &s;ooner &s;poil'd. A Linnet can live in a|bout Half a Gallon of Air for 3 Hours, &s;ick, but not quite dead; but in Air of half the Den&s;ity, not 1&frac14; Hour: A Lark expired in 4&frac12; Pints of Air, with &frac34; of it exhau&s;ted in 1&frac13; Minute. Animals cannot live long in Air extremely rare. Rarity is the Want of &s;o much Air.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Lungs are the chief In&s;tru|ment of Sanguification, working &s;ome|what after the manner of a Pre&s;s, churning and mixing together the Blood and Chyle, by a reciprocal Expan&s;ion and Dilatation, which cannot be per|form'd without the Admi&s;&s;ion and Ex|pul&s;ion of fre&s;h Air. A <HI>Foetus,</HI> through which the Mother's Blood already ela|borated,
<PB N="99" REF="112">
circulates, does not &s;tand in need of &s;uch an Organ; but as &s;oon as the Animal wants a proper Sanguifica|tion, he wants the U&s;e of Lungs: Ac|cordingly, as &s;oon as the Infant is ex|po&s;ed to the Air, being out of the com|mon Integuments, the lea&s;t Motion of the Mu&s;cles of the Thorax and Dia|phragm mu&s;t change the Dimen&s;ions of the Cavity of the Thorax; upon the Enlargement of which, the Air enters by the Windpipe into the Cavity of the Lungs, which con&s;i&s;ts of a Congeries of Air-bladders, dilatable by the Admi&s;&s;ion, and contractable again by the Expul&s;ion of Air; the whole Mechani&s;m being no|thing but that of a Pair of Bellows. By this Dilatation of the Lungs, the pul|monary Ve&s;&s;els are unfolded, and a new Pa&s;&s;age for the Blood, from the right Ventricle of the Heart through the pul|monary Artery, is opened, and the <HI>Fo|ramen ovale,</HI> by which the Blood pa&s;s'd from one Ventricle to the other, is &s;hut by a Valve, and by degrees obliterated; by this Mechani&s;m, the Blood refluent into the right Ventricle of the Heart, continues to circulate through the Lungs as long as Re&s;piration, or the recipro|cal Motion of Expan&s;ion and Contrac|tion of the Lungs is continued; but
<PB N="100" REF="113">
that cea&s;ing, the Circulation through the Lungs, which begins with Re&s;piration, mu&s;t likewi&s;e end with it, and the Blood, in Quantity Half of that of the whole Body, is at this time depriv'd of its Pa&s;&s;age by the <HI>Foramen ovale,</HI> and being &s;topt, the Animal mu&s;t die. Thus the Animal being totally depriv'd of Air to perform Re&s;piration, as in an exhau&s;t|ed Receiver, mu&s;t die: The flaccid State of the Lungs, and their being more ponderous than Lungs in their na|tural State, as by N^o VII. demon&s;trate this to be the Ca&s;e, and that the Blood &s;tagnates in the Ve&s;&s;els. The Blood-Ve&s;&s;els creep along the Surface of the Air-bladders, upon the Dilatation of the Air-bladders; they mu&s;t be unfolded and lengthened, whereas in a collap&s;ed State they are corrugated, and as it were folded; yet warm Water can be ea|&s;ily injected into the Lungs in a collap&s;ed State.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Capacity of a Human Lungs full grown, or the Sum of the Capacity of all the Air-bladders, is at lea&s;t 220 cubical Inches; for &s;o much Air is po&s;&s;i|ble to be taken in at one In&s;piration, by an Experiment of the learned and accu|rate Dr. <HI>Jurin.</HI> The Quantity of Air taken in by a common In&s;piration, is
<PB N="101" REF="114">
various in different Subjects and Times, but hardly reaches 40 Inches, perhaps at a Medium 20, at which Rate 10/11 Parts of the Cavity of the Lungs continue full of Air, or &s;ome other Fluid, after every Expiration. The Surface of the Ve&s;icles of the Lungs of a Human Creature is much larger than the whole Surface of the Skin, by a Men&s;uration and Calculation of Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI> The Surface of the Lungs of a Calf bears a Proportion to that of its whole Body, as 10 to 1.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The Blood in the Lungs is warmer than on the Surface of the Skin; the Coat of the Ve&s;&s;els extremely thin, and tho&s;e expos'd to the outward Air; and yet the Per&s;piration from the Lungs is not half of that from the Skin. <HI>Q.</HI> What is the Rea&s;on of this &s;mall Proportion? Is the Air ab&s;orb'd? for the Quantity of Per&s;piration is the Difference between the Air ab&s;orb'd, and the Humour prepar'd. There are &s;eve|ral things may be &s;aid for and again&s;t the Air's entering into the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs in Re&s;piration. 1. From the flaccid State of the Lungs of Ani|mals that die <HI>in Vacuo,</HI> it &s;eems evident that the Lungs do not expand them&s;elves
<PB N="102" REF="115">
upon the Ex&s;uction of the Air, con&s;e|quently the Air is &s;uck'd out or e&s;capes through the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs; el&s;e if retain'd, it would expand and &s;well them; if the Air has a free Egre&s;s through the Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs, it may have a free Ingre&s;s. On the other hand, Attempts to force Air into the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs by the Wind-pipe, have prov'd un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the Lungs of Animals that die <HI>in Vacuo,</HI> afterwards &s;well in the Air-pump. Things may happen in a live Animal, which will not &s;ucceed in a dead one. Air will pa&s;s through any Membrane, when moi&s;t. The quick Re&s;toration of the Balance of Air with|in and without Human Bodies, &s;hews that there is a free Communication; and it is probable that it is &s;o in the Lungs, as well as in other Parts of the Body.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. By N^o VIII. of this Chapter, the Air is quickly &s;poil'd by the Fumes of the Lungs, &s;o as to render it unfit for Re&s;piration: This mu&s;t happen from &s;everal Cau&s;es; the Gro&s;ne&s;s of the Vapours hinders the Ingre&s;s of the &s;ubtler Parts of the Air into the Ve&s;i|cles, which are &s;o &s;mall as hardly to be
<PB N="103" REF="116">
di&s;cern'd by a Micro&s;cope. If there be any Salts in any &s;ort of Fumes, they mu&s;t contract the Ve&s;icles, and per|haps the tainted Air may likewi&s;e affect the Lungs by its Heat. Another Cau&s;e is the De&s;truction of the Ela&s;ticity of the Air by &s;ulphureous Steams. Animal Steams are &s;ulphureous, and as &s;uch, in|flammable. The Sen&s;ation felt upon breathing Air tainted already with your Breath, is like that after a &s;trong Expiration, and the Lungs feel as they were much fall'n, the Air not entering into them by the Lo&s;s of Ela&s;ticity, by which it ru&s;heth into any Vacuity; al|lowing 20 In&s;pirations for 1 Minute, and 20 cubical Inches of Air for every In&s;piration, this would make 24000 cu|bical Inches of Air in an Hour; &s;ome of the ela&s;tick Power of the Air is de|&s;troy'd at every In&s;piration by the &s;ul|phureous Vapours lodg'd among&s;t the Air-bladders; and &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame numerical Air to be in&s;pired, the 24000 cubical Inches of Air would lo&s;e &s;o much of its Ela&s;ticity as to render it unfit for Re&s;piration.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Vapours ab&s;orb true Air, or de&s;troy its ela&s;tick Force at a great Rate: But the Lo&s;s of Ela&s;ticity is not the &s;ole Cau&s;e of Air tainted being un|fit
<PB N="104" REF="117">
for Re&s;piration. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI></NOTE> A Rat liv'd 14 Hours in 2024 Inches of Air, during which time 1/27 of the whole was ab|&s;orb'd. A Cat, 3 Months old, liv'd an Hour in 594 cubical Inches of Air, with the Lo&s;s of 1/30 of true Air; and 19 Parts in 20 of the Air of de|toniz'd Nitre is de&s;troy'd in 18 Days. The Air produc'd by Di&s;tillations, lo&s;es its Ela&s;ticity. Burning Matches de&s;troy the Ela&s;ticity of the Air at a great Rate. The Air, generated from fermenting &s;ulphureous Mixtures, is quickly ab&s;orb'd, as in burning of Filings of Iron and Brim&s;tone, Antimony and Brim&s;tone. The Lungs, and all the Parts of the Thorax, undoubtedly per&s;pire; if this per&s;pirable Matter retain'd any Ela&s;ticity, it would be a Counterpoi&s;e to the out|ward Air, and &s;top the Expan&s;ion of the Lungs, as much as a Wound in the Thorax &s;tops the Re&s;piration of that Lobe, till the outward Air is excluded. The Air therefore in the per&s;pirable Matter of the Thorax is ab&s;orb'd, and the Steam is unela&s;tick. Sulphureous Va|pours de&s;troy ela&s;tick Air only to a cer|tain Degree, for when Air is &s;aturated with Vapours to a certain Quantity, no
<PB N="105" REF="118">
more ela&s;tick Air is ab&s;orb'd, which is a happy Contrivance of Nature, el&s;e the Air, for a great Extent, might be &s;poil'd with &s;ulphureous Steams. But tho' the Ela&s;ticity of the Air is never totally de|&s;troy'd, the &s;ame once de&s;troy'd is never recover'd, yet in &s;ome Ca&s;es this Ab|&s;orption of Air will reach to a great Degree. The Suffocation of Animals and the Extinction of Candles in Mines, proceed from &s;ulphureous Vapours. Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> has found out the be&s;t Expedients for preventing immediate Suffocation from tainted Air, and to enable a Man to &s;u&s;|tain it a longer time, in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;i|ty, which is by breathing through Muf|flers, which imbibes the&s;e Vapours; and this an&s;wers Experience, for the Mufflers increa&s;e in Weight by the Vapours which they imbibe. Salts are likewi&s;e &s;trong Imbibers of &s;ulphureous Steams; therefore he combin'd both the&s;e Sub&s;tances toge|ther, and by dipping his Mufflers in a Solution of Sea-Salt, Salt of Tartar, or White-wine Vinegar, he was able &s;till to breathe longer in this tainted Air. Steams of Vinegar are reckon'd Antipe&s;tilential; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on Salts may be &s;o, by &s;ucking up the noxious Vapours. In Salt Mines, great Numbers of People live in good Health, who never breathe
<PB N="106" REF="119" MS="y">
the Air above-ground: It &s;eems likewi&s;e to follow from this Experiment, that a Room hung with &s;ome Woollen Manu|facture, mu&s;t be whol&s;om, by imbibing the Steams of Animals, Fire and Can|dles, or any noxious Vapours.</P>
<P N="15">XV. From the foregoing Experiments, a natural Account may be given of the Sufferings of People who pa&s;s a long time in a Room overcharg'd with the Steams of Animals, Fire and Candles. A Gallon of Air is &s;poil'd by the Steams of the Breath in one Minute, &s;o as to be unfit for Re&s;piration; con&s;equently a Tun, or 63 Gallons, would not &s;upply a Human Creature an Hour; if he was &s;hut up in this Tun of Air, the Air would be tainted by the Steams of the whole Body in &frac13; of the Time, or about 20 Minutes: And I believe it an&s;wers Experience, that a Human Creature could not live in a Tun of the &s;ame Air 20 Minutes; con&s;equently 500 Peo|ple, &s;hut up in a Room of 500 Tun Capacity, &s;o as to have no Communica|tion with the outward Air, would be dead, or in Convul&s;ions, and other fatal Symptoms, in 20 Minutes; or in a Room of 3000 Tun Capacity, in 2 Hours: This is indeed never the Ca&s;e; and there is always in every Room &s;ome
<PB N="107" REF="120">
Vents for the inward Air, and Inlets for the outward Air; notwith&s;tanding which, the Air is much tainted, and tho' it is not fatal, it is hurtful. La|dies, and other tender People, pa&s;s a great Part of their Time in Rooms ex|tremely well fitted up, &s;o as to admit &s;carcely any outward Air, except by o|pening of Doors and Windows; the Air of the Room is tainted very much with the Steams of Animals and Candles. <HI>Q.</HI> Whether &s;ome of their nervous Symp|toms may not proceed from this Cau&s;e? Fire and Candles taint the Air, a middle-&s;iz'd Candle as much as a Human Creature, and are as &s;oon extinct by &s;ul|phureous Steams, and by the De&s;truction of the ela&s;tick Force of the Air; there|fore Fire, fed by cool Air, burns mo&s;t briskly, and mo&s;t of all in a keen Fro&s;t: Heat, by weakening the Spring of the Air, abates the Force of Fire; the Light of the Sun will put out a Fire; and a &s;mall Fire will not burn near a large one. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI></NOTE> Fire &s;eems to be produc'd by the Ac|tion and Reaction of Sulphur and Air; for Salt, Water, and Earth, are not in|flammable. There is &s;omething analo|gous
<PB N="108" REF="121">
to this in Human Creatures. Air, weaken'd in its Spring, is not &s;o fit for Re&s;piration, nor perhaps for any other animal Purpo&s;es. We find by Experience, that A&s;thmaticks cannot bear the Air of hot Rooms and Cities where there is a great deal of Fuel burnt, except in Sum|mer, when the Con&s;umption of Fuel is le&s;s.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. As to the Force or Pre&s;&s;ure of the outward Air upon the Lungs, it is not &s;o great as has been calculated by &s;ome, who&s;e Calculations have been rec|tify'd by one of Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s, who makes the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air upon the Lungs not much more than that of falling Dew. The Force of a Smith's Bellows will rai&s;e Mercury one Inch; a Bellows has but one Air-bladder, and a Human Lungs Millions; and it requires a great|er Force to draw in and expel the Air, through a Capacity of 220 cubical Inches, di&s;tributed into Millions of little Cells, than through one Cell of the Capacity of 220 cubical Inches; the Friction in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable; it requires a con&s;iderable Force to move a Pair of Bellows of the Capacity of a Human Lungs, with a No&s;e of the Ca|pacity of the Wind-pipe, and would re|quire &s;till more, if they were divided in|to
<PB N="109" REF="122">
as many Cells as a Human Lungs: Therefore it &s;eems to me, that the Force of the Air upon the Lungs is at lea&s;t 1/30 of the Weight of the Atmo&s;phere; but whatever be the Force of the Air upon the Lungs, it varies with its Gravity and Ela&s;ticity, con&s;equently the Variation of tho&s;e mu&s;t have proportional Effects up|on the Motion of the Blood through the Lungs. The Expan&s;ion of the Lungs by Re&s;piration being nece&s;&s;ary for the Circulation through the Lungs. The Circulation is more ea&s;y, in Proportion to that Expan&s;ion; on the contrary, whatever &s;tops the Circulation through the Lungs, mu&s;t hinder the Dilatation, by which it is plain, Re&s;piration mu&s;t have an Influence upon the Pul&s;e, as to Frequency, Strength, Hardne&s;s, or Soft|ne&s;s: Whether it bears any Proportion as to Time, I leave to be determin'd by future Ob&s;ervations: As far as I have ob&s;erv'd, the Frequency of a natural Pul&s;e, is to that of Re&s;piration, about 10 to 3; this I &s;ugge&s;t only, as a Matter worth the inquiring into. Too great Repletion, or too great Emptine&s;s of the Lungs, occa&s;ion a quick Pul&s;e.

Mr. <HI>Hales.</HI> A &s;maller Quantity of Blood circulates with greater Ea&s;e through the Lungs; in which Ca&s;e the Heart acts like a voluntary Agent, who when there is a le&s;s Weight of the Fluid to be forced through Pipes by pumping, is able to redouble its Strokes. The Ex|periments and Calculations about the Force of the Heart in propelling the Blood, do not determine its ab&s;olute Force, but only that which it exerts in that Circum&s;tance: The Heart employs various Degrees of Force to carry on the Circulation, and pre&s;erve the Life of the Animal, according to the Quan|tity of Re&s;i&s;tance: But whatever the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air is upon the Lungs, it is dimini&s;h'd and increas'd in Pro|portion to its Den&s;ity.

A certain Degree of Heat is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep the Blood from coagula|ting, and too great a Degree of Heat ac|tually coagulates; that of a Human Crea|ture approaches very near the Degree of Coagulation. But this Heat of the Blood does not proceed merely from the &s;aline &s;ulphureous Parts that are in it, for Fi&s;hes have rather more Salt and Oil in their Blood, than terre&s;trial Animals. The Heat of the Blood is the Effect of Motion and Attrition of ela&s;tick Particles, and for that Rea&s;on is greater in the Lungs, than in any other Organ; no doubt the &s;aline and oily Parts, of which the Blood con&s;i&s;ts, makes it more &s;u&s;ceptible of Heat by Motion, than a mere watery Fluid.</P>
<P N="20">XX. Tho' we have endeavour'd to ex|plain the U&s;e and Effects of Air in Re|&s;piration, as far as is obvious to our

Sen&s;es, and deducible from mechanical Principles, we are far from imagining that Air has not many U&s;es and Effects in the Animal Oeconomy, which we &s;hall never be able to account for; and that there is in it &s;ome other vital Principle, which makes it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Life of all Animals.

Animal Life is pre&s;ently extingui&s;h'd without Com|munication with the outward Air, and may in&s;tantly be re&s;tor'd by it. All Ani|mals have &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages to in&s;pire the outward Air.

<PB N="116" REF="129">
the Air in&s;pir'd by an O&s;cillation de|pending upon its Ela&s;ticity, regulates the Animal Motions as a <HI>Pendulum</HI> of a Clock. This Hypothe&s;is is &s;ubject to many Difficulties. Air in Liquors does not exert its Ela&s;ticity till collected in Ma&s;&s;es; it has always the Power of ex|erting it, but till a certain Quantity of the incumbent Pre&s;&s;ure is taken off, it continues in a fixed State, and divided into its minute&s;t Parts. Many have en|deavoured to explain this vital Force of Air, I think un&s;ucce&s;sfully; therefore I would advi&s;e &s;uch as deal in tho&s;e Sub|jects to be contented to rea&s;on from the &s;en&s;ible Effects of Air, of which they are &s;ure from Experience. The Lungs being of a lax delicate Texture, with a Surface of a larger Extent than of the whole Skin expos'd to the outward Air, and of a much hotter Temperature, mu&s;t be extremely &s;en&s;ible of the Qua|lities of the outward Air, and affected by them as by outward Contact; there|fore the Choice of Air to People of ten|der Lungs, is a Matter of great Impor|tance: Fir&s;t, as to Humidity, the lea&s;t Quantity of it mu&s;t produce a Cough; as for hot Air, the Lungs cannot bear Air that is hotter than the Animal Fluids; Heat and Moi&s;ture together, produce

Putrefaction. Con&s;umptive People often die in a hot Day: But tho&s;e two Quali|ties &s;eldom re&s;ide long in Air together. It ought likewi&s;e to be con&s;ider'd, that Heating-Rooms, by any Contrivance which does not let the Vapours e&s;cape, may be dangerous to the Lungs: On the con|trary, Air inten&s;ely cold, by its Contact, may conden&s;e and coagulate the Blood, through the thin Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o as to produce Inflammations, which reign here in the Winter, and in many Coun|tries upon cold Bla&s;ts. We have &s;een the Effects of &s;ome cold and moi&s;t Exhala|tions in two epidemical Cartarrhous Fe|vers.

<P N="21">XXI. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;en&s;ible and varia|ble Qualities of the Air, there may be &s;aline Exhalations, which mu&s;t affect the Lungs &s;till in a greater Degree; not only contracting the Air-Bladders, but corro|ding the Solids, and coagulating the Flu|ids. It &s;eems probable, that there are a great many &s;uch Exhalations in <HI>Britain,</HI> for it abounds with Mineral Waters; &s;uch as is the Water, &s;uch is the Air. The Air of <HI>Holland</HI> is more benign to
<PB N="118" REF="131" MS="y">
tender Lungs, than that of <HI>England,</HI> tho' it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be moi&s;ter; but it is free from Mineral Steams, of which there are none in the Country. The Lungs being the chief Organ of Sangui|fication, good Air mu&s;t help the &s;econd Dige&s;tion; and we often feel the Effects of good Air, as well in Stomachick as in Pectoral Ca&s;es. In &s;hort, Air has &s;o great an Influence, both upon the Fluids and Solids of Human Bodies, that it is Matter of Experience that &s;ome People find them&s;elves much di&s;order'd in one &s;ort of Air and Weather, and perfectly well in another; the Cau&s;e of which Change is ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by any Per|&s;on who under&s;tands the Phy&s;iology of Air, and the Con&s;titution of the Patient; and for this &s;ingle Rea&s;on, the Nature and Effects of Air are a very proper Subject of Study, becau&s;e the Choice of it is often a nece&s;&s;ary Part of Advice. The Effects of Air, when it enters the Tho|rax by an Aperture, are very much to be regarded in the Management of Wounds in the Thorax; for fir&s;t, the Air which enters into the Thorax, is a Counterpoi&s;e to that which enters by In&s;piration, and mu&s;t &s;top the Expan&s;ion of that Lobe of the Lungs where the Appetite is. The Air entering into the Cavity of
<PB N="119" REF="132">
the Thorax, corrupts and converts into <HI>Pus,</HI> Blood, and other animal Juices. If there is a Communication through the Lungs with the Air, admitted by Re&s;pi|ration, it may produce bad Symptoms, and even Suffocation; tho' the Ca&s;e &s;el|dom happens. It has therefore been the Practice of judicious Chirurgeons, not to dre&s;s &s;uch Wounds with large Tents, which, among&s;t other Inconveniencies, have that of admitting Air at every Dre&s;|&s;ing.</P>

<PB N="125" REF="138">
Air, and that of Di&s;ea&s;es, of which one could give not a few In&s;tances. The Con&s;titution of his fir&s;t Section, a wet <HI>Autumn,</HI> dry Winter with Northerly Winds, a cold Spring, a mild Summer; from whence he ob&s;erv'd few Suppura|tions. The Con&s;titution of his Second Section, a moi&s;t <HI>Autumn,</HI> a Winter moi&s;t and afterwards cold, a cold Northerly Spring; the natural Product of &s;uch a cold moi&s;t Year, were Inflammations of the Eyes, Colicks, Fluxes of the Bel|ly, great Fluidity, catarrhous Fevers, few continued Fevers, Tertians, Semi-Tertians, &s;ome Quartans, no great Thir&s;t, or Haemorrages attending Fe|vers, Catarrhs, Defluxions upon the Joints; in &s;hort, all the Effects of moi&s;t Air, imbib'd by Human Bodies. What &s;eems remarkable in the Con&s;titution of his Third Section, is an Exce&s;s of Drought, a dry cold Winter, Spring, and Summer: This Year was noted for Pal&s;ies, (as the la&s;t, after a great Drought, was in <HI>London</HI>) Dy&s;enteries, Haemorrages of all &s;orts, the Effect of a Stricture of the Fibres from Cold and Drought, continued Fevers with Deli|rium and Thir&s;t, the Di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t dan|gerous to the Young and Vigorous; great and repeated feveri&s;h Rigors, both

In this Book he likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, That a mild Winter, with Southerly Winds, a dry Spring, and a Summer with meazling Rains like Dew, were attended with Fevers, and Paro|tids, or Tumors behind the Ears. A &s;ort of a Pe&s;tilential Sea&s;on, de&s;crib'd in his Third Section of his Third Book, was a hard Winter, &s;ucceeded by a rainy warm Spring, and an extremely hot Summer, without Winds, not very un|like the Con&s;titution of the Year of the Plague of <HI>London:</HI> This Year, de&s;crib'd by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> was remarkable for all inflammatory Eruptions upon the Skin, and all Di&s;ea&s;es of Putrefaction. In the Sixth Book he ob&s;erves, That frequent Changes of the Winds from North to South, produce Inflammations of the Lungs; and in general, that the proper
<PB N="127" REF="140">
Weather of the Sea&s;on, as it happens later or &s;ooner, dry, cold, hot, with or without Winds, determine the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e are a few In|&s;tances of the Sagacity and Indu&s;try of this great Man, and his great Applica|tion to this Part of his Profe&s;&s;ion, of the Influence of the Air upon Human Con&s;titutions, in which, no que&s;tion, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Ob&s;ervations of his Predece&s;&s;ors; and I hope to &s;hew in the Sequel of this Chapter, that a great many of his Ob&s;ervations, even tho&s;e that &s;eem mo&s;t fanciful, depend upon na|tural Cau&s;es adequate to their Effects.</P>

The Inhabitants often &s;uffer from Ca|tarrhous Di&s;tempers, more than in North|ern Countries, their Bodies being more delicate, and their Pores more open, by the preceding Heat.

Their <HI>Autumn</HI> la&s;ts <HI>Sep|tember</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> and their Winter <HI>No|vember</HI> and <HI>December.</HI> The extreme Heat of the fir&s;t Summer proceeds from the hot Winds which blow from the South and South-Ea&s;t, call'd by the Inhabi|tants <HI>Camp&s;in,</HI> from their Continuance of 50 Days; tho' they have no deter|min'd time, but la&s;t &s;ometimes more than 3 Months, and reign commonly <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> they blow o|ver the Sands, which they rai&s;e in Clouds, &s;ometimes &s;o as to ob&s;cure the Sun: During this time, many epidemical Di&s;|ea&s;es rage, e&s;pecially Inflammations of the Eyes; a Fever, which the Inhabi|tants call <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">melmuia,</HI> attended with a De|liti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and proves often mortal in a few H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and even the Plague it &s;elf.

and <HI>July,</HI> which, by the Cour&s;e of the Sun, &s;hould be the greate&s;t, is &s;o mo|derated by the Northerly and moi&s;t Winds blowing over the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and by the Overflowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> that the In|habitants grow healthy, and &s;ow their Seed in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>Oc|tober.</HI> Their Winter has &s;eldom any Snow, Fro&s;t, or Rain, or any thing be|&s;ides Dew; unle&s;s in &s;ome Places bor|dering upon the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and re|ceiving Clouds from thence.

Another Cau&s;e by which both the Heat and Drought of the Air is temper'd, is the Overflowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which ri&s;ing in the Moun|tains of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> bends its Cour&s;e North|erly through a Tract of Land near 30 Degrees.

highe&s;t of all, to 18 the lowe&s;t, in Cu|bits; the middle 24; 18 is a Height barely &s;ufficient to make an Inundation. Its Water not only refre&s;heth the Air with a kindly Moi&s;ture, but is the mo&s;t delicious Drink in the World, when purify'd by the Depo&s;ition of its Sedi|ment, being of it &s;elf a Cure for mo&s;t Di&s;tempers, where Dilution, a Diure&s;is or Sweating is nece&s;&s;ary, which <HI>Pro&s;per Alpinus</HI> found by Experience. During the time of the Increa&s;e of the <HI>Nile,</HI> the Clouds pa&s;s over <HI>Egypt,</HI> driven by the Northerly Winds, and no doubt fall down in the Mountains, and contribute to moi&s;ten and cool the Air. <HI>Pro&s;per Alpinus</HI> gives credit to the Experiment of judging of the Increa&s;e of the <HI>Nile,</HI> by a Lump of Earth taken out of the River, and kept dry, which begins to increa&s;e in Weight as the River begins to &s;well; and by the Quantity of this Increa&s;e, they judge of the Quantity of the Inundation. That the Earth will increa&s;e by Moi&s;ture is certain; that the Quantity of Moi&s;ture may be a Mea&s;ure for that of the Rain, and that for the Quantity of the Inundation, are all pro|bable; but a Spunge perhaps might be a better Hygrometer than the Earth of the River.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="133" REF="146">
VI. There are &s;everal Things remark|able in the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Egyp|tian</HI> Air. The Per&s;piration of the Soil, which is &s;andy and barren, cannot affect the Air very much, the Exhalations be|ing mo&s;tly either from the Surface of the Inundation, or the Mud and Slime after it is over. The natural Heat and Dryne&s;s of the Air, and the Change from that to cooler Moi&s;ture; the A|batement of the Tropical Heats by Northerly Winds; the Extremity of Heat and Drought, by the Southerly Winds blowing over Sands; and the Moi&s;ture again induced by the Clouds, from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and the Inunda|tion; the Exhalations from &s;tagnating and putrid Water, when the Inundation is quite over; and la&s;tly, the Temperance and regular Diet of mo&s;t of the Inhabi|tants, mu&s;t give a fair Experiment of the Effects of Air upon Human Con&s;ti|tutions. Accordingly, tho&s;e who labour, live hard, and cannot defend them&s;elves from the Injuries of the Wind, mo&s;tly dry and hot, are extremely lean and &s;qualid: The Rich, by a plentiful and nouri&s;hing Diet, and pre&s;erving them|&s;elves from the Heat and Drought by Bathing, Relaxation of their Fibres by

<P N="7">VII. The Air of <HI>Egypt</HI> having no noxious Qualities from the Per&s;piration of the Ground, were it not from the accidental ones above-mention'd, would be extremely whol&s;om; and the People who know how to defend them&s;elves from tho&s;e Accidents, live to great Ages. The frequent Changes of Heat and Cold, Moi&s;ture and Drought, pro|duce all the Di&s;tempers of the Catar|hous Kind, Arthritick Di&s;ea&s;es; and, by the &s;trong Per&s;piration, Lepro&s;ies, e|ven the <HI>Elephantia&s;is.</HI> The Effects of a hot dry Air, by a Southerly Wind, blow|ing over a &s;andy Country, are felt &s;trongly; inflammatory Di&s;tempers, e&s;pe|cially a raging Fever with a Phren&s;y, call'd <HI>Demelmuia,</HI> mortal in a few Hours. They feel likewi&s;e all the good Effects of the Abatement of this Heat and Drought by Northerly Winds, the Over|flowing of the <HI>Nile.</HI> They are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to all the Di&s;ea&s;es from putrid and &s;tagnating Water, and Exhalations from Heat after the Inundation is over; and the&s;e are often pe&s;tilential; therefore &s;uch as can, live remote from the Channel of the River.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="135" REF="148">
VIII. Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers are fre|quent in <HI>Egypt:</HI> It is a popular Opi|nion there, that they are brought from <HI>Syria, Barbary,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> All I can infer from hence is, that the Plague has &s;omething infamous as well as ter|rible, and no Country will own it to be their own Product, for the People of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> alledge it is imported to them from <HI>Egypt:</HI> But what I think demon&s;trates the Plague to be endemial to <HI>Egypt,</HI> is its regular Inva&s;ion and going off at certain Sea&s;ons; beginning about <HI>September,</HI> the time of Sub&s;idence of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and ending in <HI>June,</HI> the time of the Inundation; in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e are all the Cau&s;es productive of Putre|faction, Heat, and putrid Exhalations, and no Winter Fro&s;t to check them. But what is wonderful, the Plague and the Fevers, from the Heat of the <HI>Camp|&s;in,</HI> go off by the Northerly Winds, and the Overflowing of the <HI>Nile.</HI> The whol|&s;om Quality of Northerly Winds for checking pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers, has been ob&s;erv'd by all antient Phy&s;icians; and, to &s;hew that the Plague depends upon the Temperature of the Air, <HI>Pro&s;per Alpinus</HI> takes notice, that upon the Swel|ling of the <HI>Nile,</HI> the Infection, and e|ven the Danger from infected Clothes
<PB N="136" REF="149">
and Furniture, goes off; be&s;ides the cool|ing of the Air, the Northerly Winds may di&s;&s;ipate the &s;tagnating Vapours, and the Running of the <HI>Nile</HI> the &s;tag|nating Water. <HI>Galen</HI> and <HI>Hippocrates</HI> both ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> or North|erly Winds blowing in Summer, made a whol&s;om Sea&s;on. This Ob&s;ervation is more &s;en&s;ible in hot Countries than in ours.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I thought it worth while to in|quire into the Effects of the Air within the Tropick, and particularly in &s;ome Place under the Line: It happens lucki|ly that <HI>Boutius,</HI> a very learned and &s;a|gacious Phy&s;ician, has left us a De|&s;cription of the Air and Di&s;ea&s;es of the Inhabitants of <HI>Java:</HI> Tho' its Situa|tion under the Line mu&s;t make it hot, and as therefore &s;ome would imagine extremely dry, <HI>Boutius</HI> &s;ays it is moi&s;t, from the great Quantities of Rain and &s;tagnant Water, and from Moi&s;ture and Heat, and perhaps from Salts produc'd from tho&s;e Qualities. The putrifying Quality of the Air is very manife&s;t in rotting of Clothes, and ru&s;ting of Me|tals: From the&s;e Qualities, the Air feels to Human Bodies, piercing and ac|tive. All the Inhabitants of hot Coun|tries have that Sen&s;ation of the pene|trating
<PB N="137" REF="150">
Quality of Air, cold after great Heats, which perhaps proceeds chiefly from the Pores of their Skin, being re|lax'd before by Heat; &s;uch Bodies mu&s;t imbibe the outward Air fa&s;ter. In <HI>Ja|va,</HI> as in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Northerly Winds render the Air whol&s;om, by abating the extreme Heat; &s;ome Land Winds carry|ing along with them the &s;tagnant Va|pours, are often otherwi&s;e. The Soil being fruitful and rich, emits Steams, con&s;i&s;ting of volatile and active Parts, which fructify the Soil, but are hurtful to Human Bodies. The Sea&s;ons here cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Heat, by rea&s;on of the Smallne&s;s of their La|titude: There are only two; what may be call'd Winter, is the Rainy Sea|&s;on: This Sea&s;on is attended with Di&s;ea&s;es which depend upon Putrefac|tion. The Inhabitants mea&s;ure their Sea|&s;ons of Heat and Cold by the Times of the Day; the Mornings and Nights are cooler by the Ab&s;ence of the Sun, and by the Sea Breezes; the &s;corching Heat of the middle of the Day, makes that Time unfit for Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="10">X. The popular Di&s;ea&s;es here are, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> A Species of Pal&s;y, call'd by the In|habitants of this and &s;ome other Coun|tries of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies, Beriberium;</HI> the

Cau&s;e of which is evidently cold Air, imbib'd by the Pores of the Skin, ex|tremely relax'd by Heat before, and there|fore invades &s;uch as incautiou&s;ly expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Morning Air, or throw their Bed-clothes off in the Night. Another nervous Di&s;ea&s;e, call'd <HI>Catalep|&s;is,</HI> is likewi&s;e popular in this Country, and proceeds from the penetrating Qua|lity of the Air imbib'd by relax'd Bo|dies. In this Di&s;ea&s;e the Patient grows rigid, like a Statue, and dies in a few Hours. Diarrhoeas and Dy&s;enteries are common from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, from &s;ud|den Suppre&s;&s;ions of Per&s;piration; the plentiful U&s;e of cold Fruits, from the &s;ame Cau&s;es; they invade us in <HI>Autumn.</HI> It is Matter of Ob&s;ervation, that great Heats exalt the Bile, perhaps by the Ex|hau&s;tion of the watery Particles which dilute it by a &s;trong &s;en&s;ible Per&s;pira|tion; and therefore the <HI>Cholera Morbus,</HI> and other Di&s;ea&s;es of the Liver, are common and fatal in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and from di&s;ea&s;ed Livers, Drop&s;ies are common in <HI>Java.</HI> Atrophies are like|wi&s;e frequent in <HI>Java.</HI> In this Coun|try then, Fevers are &s;eldom intermitting, but continual, with Phren&s;ies, and other dreadful Symptoms, as during the <HI>Camp|&s;in</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> proving mortal in a &s;hort

The Author takes no|tice of Blindne&s;s as being common in the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, which the Inhabitants a&s;cribe to the immoderate U&s;e of hot Rice; there|fore they expo&s;e their Rice, after it is boil'd, to the cool Air; perhaps they may be mi&s;taken likewi&s;e as to the Cau&s;e of this.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Di&s;ea&s;es of <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> tho' it lies in 14 Degrees of Northern Latitude, re&s;emble very much tho&s;e a|bove de&s;crib'd in <HI>Java:</HI> When the Wind blows from the We&s;terly Points, from <HI>April</HI> to the End of <HI>July,</HI> it renders the Air &s;o hot and dry, that were it not for Sea-Breezes from the South-Ea&s;t in the Afternoons, the Inhabitants could not bear it: The Effects of this Heat are a den&s;e thick Blood, inflammatory Di&s;|ea&s;es, Fevers with Phren&s;ies, <HI>Cholera Mor|bus,</HI>

The Air is temperate from <HI>December</HI> to <HI>March.</HI> The acute Di&s;ea|&s;es which invade in that Sea&s;on, e&s;pe|cially the Smallpox, are le&s;s dange|rous than tho&s;e which invade in a hot|ter.</P>

<P N="13">XIII. There are &s;ome few modern Phy&s;icians who have left us Ob&s;erva|tions of the Sea&s;ons, and the cotempora|ry epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es, as <HI>Bernardini Ra|mazini,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Modena,</HI> who has di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf by &s;everal ingeni|ous Pieces which he has publi&s;h'd in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Con&s;titutions of the Years</HI> 1690, 1691, 1692, 1693, 1694, and the epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es about <HI>Mo|dena,</HI> and the adjacent Countries.

What was ob&s;ervable was, the Silence of the Gra&s;hoppers, and Croking of Frogs, and Bees not making Honey: No remarkable Di&s;ea&s;es in the Winter, becau&s;e the Heat had not begun to rai&s;e the Vapours: A great Run of Inter|mitting Fevers in the Spring, which &s;till multiply'd, and ended in double Ter|tians in the Summer, which were the mo&s;t epidemical that ever were known, and the Country more unhealthy than the Towns; an unu&s;ual Vermination, or Quantity of Worms in Human Bodies; Parotids, &s;uppurating Diarrhoeas, and all other Catarrhous Di&s;tempers. The&s;e Fevers not very mortal, con&s;idering the va&s;t Numbers that were &s;eiz'd, except a|mong&s;t Children and tender Women: No continued Fevers: Other Animals &s;ickly; Cattle, with Eruptions about their Heads. What was &s;till mo&s;t re|markable, was the nocturnal Acce&s;&s;ion of the Fevers, being the wor&s;t, and a

great Relaxation or Debility of Patients till the Sun was up, the Fever depend|ing upon Acidity rather than Bile; and for that Rea&s;on the Bark was generally ineffectual, and the copious U&s;e of Wine generally beneficial. <HI>Ramazini</HI> a&s;&s;igns probable Cau&s;es for all tho&s;e Symptoms: The unu&s;ual Vermination caus'd by In|dige&s;tion of the Eggs of In&s;ects, which are commonly taken in with Aliment; Sucklings dying, from the Acidity and other bad Qualities of the Nur&s;es Milk. He reckons the Silence of Gra&s;hoppers a Pre&s;age of a &s;ickly Time; and quotes <HI>Mercurialis,</HI> who ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame thing at <HI>Padua,</HI> in 1577. The 1691 was directly contrary in its Temperament to the preceeding; a fro&s;ty dry Winter, a hot dry Spring, a hot Summer; and as the Sea&s;ons, &s;o were the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es almo&s;t oppo&s;ite: The popu|lar Di&s;ea&s;es of the Winter, were Apo|plexies, Quinzies, Pleuri&s;ies, Inflamma|tions of the Lungs, Catarrhs, all with &s;izy Blood; letting of Blood, and what|ever gave Fluxility to it, reliev'd. The Country-people who us'd Labour and Exerci&s;e, were more healthy than Citi|zens. In cold dry Weather, the Inha|bitants of the Country and Cities are equally free from the noxious Qualities
<PB N="144" REF="157">
of the Per&s;piration of the Earth; there|fore the Advantage as to the other Qua|lities of the Air, is on the Country's Side, e&s;pecially in Di&s;tempers inflamma|tory, becau&s;e of the le&s;s Exerci&s;e, more plentiful and le&s;s &s;imple Diet of Citi|zens. In the Spring, &s;cabious Irrup|tions upon the Skin were epidemi|cal; this perhaps from the Acidity of the Blood, contracted the former Year, and the Salts retain'd beginning now to per&s;pire by Heat. Madne&s;s among&s;t the Dogs was epidemical from great Heat and Drought. A prodigious Number of Fevers of the bilious kind in the Sum|mer, which turn'd mortal in the <HI>Au|tumn;</HI> the Remedies of which were di|rectly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the Fevers of the preceding Year; for the&s;e want|ed Cordials, and as it were a Spur; but tho&s;e of the Year 1691 wanted a Bridle, and were generally reliev'd by Blood-letting, cooling acid Medicines, all the Symptoms proceeding from a bilious Acrimony: The Bark, which had been ineffectual in the Intermittents of the former Year, was &s;ucce&s;sful in this. <HI>Ramazini</HI> ob&s;erves in the &s;ucceeding Years 1692, 1693, 1694, tho' di&s;&s;imu|lar in their Temperature, yet were not very unlike in their epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es,
<PB N="145" REF="158">
but e&s;pecially in a petechial or &s;potted Fever, which raged mo&s;t at the New and Full Moon; he a&s;cribes this to an unu&s;ual Duration of Southerly Winds, which has been ob&s;erved by all Phy&s;i|cians to make an unwhol&s;om Con&s;titu|tion of Air; he a&s;cribes it to this Cau&s;e, becau&s;e the Inhabitants of the Foot of the <HI>Appennines</HI> being defended from the Southerly Winds, were not infe&s;ted with the&s;e petechial Fevers. I think I may venture to add one Reflexion to tho&s;e of the judicious Author, That if the great Rains and Moi&s;ture of the Year 1690, had been &s;ucceeded with great Heat, the Fevers would have put on ano|ther Genius, and perhaps been Pe&s;tilen|tial.</P>

Our learned Pre&s;ident, Sir <HI>Hans Sloan,</HI> has given us a Journal of the Wea|ther of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the Hi&s;tory of the popular Di&s;ea&s;es of that Country; the Re&s;emblance of the Con&s;titution and Diet of the Inhabitants to tho&s;e of
<PB N="146" REF="159">
their Mother-Country, occa&s;ion a great Affinity likewi&s;e in the popular Di&s;ea&s;es, except in &s;ome few Ca&s;es which are the Product of a warmer Climate. But as there is &s;till a great Penury of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, all we can do is to rea|&s;on from the Laws of Mechanicks, and the known Properties and Qualities of Air, what mu&s;t be their natural Ef|fects. It &s;eems agreeable to Rea&s;on and Experience, that the Air operates &s;en&s;i|bly in forming the Con&s;titutions of Mankind, the Specialities of Features, Complexion, Temper, and con&s;equently the Manners of Mankind, which are found to vary much in different Coun|tries and Climates. As to Features, what an infinite Variety ari&s;eth from the Combination of the Parts of a Human Face, &s;o that &s;ince the Creation of the World, perhaps there were never two that, upon a narrow In&s;pection, perfectly re&s;embled one another. There are Faces not only individual, but gen|tilitious and national; <HI>European, A&s;ia|tick, Chine&s;e, African, Grecian</HI> Faces, are characteris'd. This Diver&s;ity of Na|tional Features and Shapes is not alto|gether the Effect of Propagation from the &s;ame original Stock; for it is known by Experience, that Tran&s;plantation
<PB N="147" REF="160">
changeth the Stature and outward Shape, both of Plants and Animals. <HI>Hippocra|tes</HI> makes great Account of the Influ|ence of the Air upon the <HI>Foetus,</HI> both before and after Birth: He is of Opi|nion, that the great Variety of <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Faces is owing to that of the Air and Sea&s;ons; there being &s;uch great Ex|cur&s;ions in the Extremities of Heat and Cold, their Offspring is at it were be|got and brought forth in different Cli|mates. That the Shape of Animals &s;hould be modify'd by the Air, is no ways unaccountable: An Animal grow|ing, expands its Fibres in the Air as a Fluid, which, by a gentle Pre&s;&s;ure, re|&s;i&s;ts the Motion of the Heart in the Expan&s;ion and Elongation of the Fibres; and tho' the Fibres of &s;everal Animals &s;hoot, as it were, in this Fluid, accord|ing to their original Shapes, yet &s;uch a Fluid re&s;i&s;ting by its Pre&s;&s;ure, is, in re|&s;pect to the Animal, like a &s;oft Mold, in which the Body is form'd; and therefore, according to the Quantity of its Pre&s;&s;ure, depending upon its mo&s;t permanent State of den&s;e, rare, hot, cold, dry, moi&s;t, mu&s;t have &s;ome In|fluence in forming the outward Figure of &s;uch a Body in a State of Accretion: Be&s;ides this outward Pre&s;&s;ure, the Air
<PB N="148" REF="161">
being mix'd with the animal Fluids, determines their Condition as to Rari|ty, Den&s;ity, Vi&s;co&s;ity, Tenuity, and &s;e|veral other Qualities.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. That the Complexion depends much upon the Air, is plain from Ex|perience; the Complexion of the In|habitants of &s;everal Countries being fair, &s;warthy, black, and adu&s;t, according to the Degrees of Heat, Drought, Moi|&s;ture, or Coolne&s;s of the Air. The In|habitants of Countries in great Lati|tudes are generally fairer than tho&s;e that live nearer the Sun.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That the Temper and Pa&s;|&s;ions are influenc'd by the Air, is no le&s;s certain: People of delicate Nerves and moveable Spirits are often joyful, &s;ullen, &s;prightly, dejected, hopeful, de|&s;pairing, according to the Weather; and the&s;e Changes happen, but pa&s;s unob|&s;erv'd in &s;tronger Con&s;titutions. There are Days in which the intellectual Fa|culties of Memory, Imagination, Judg|ment, are more vigorous, therefore it &s;eems probable that the Genius of Na|tions depends upon that of their Air. Arts and Sciences have hardly ever ap|peared in very great or very &s;mall Lati|tudes: The Inhabitants of &s;ome Coun|tries &s;ucceed be&s;t in tho&s;e Arts which
<PB N="149" REF="162">
require Indu&s;try and great Application of Mind: Others in &s;uch as require Ima|gination; from hence &s;ome Countries produce better Mathematicians, Philo&s;o|phers, and Mechanicks; others better Painters, Statuaries, Architects, and Po|ets, which, be&s;ides the Rules of Art, demand Imagination. It &s;eems to me, that Labour is more tolerable to the Inhabitants of colder Climates, and Liveline&s;s of Imagination to tho&s;e of hot.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. There are two things com|mon to all Mankind, Air and Aliment; both indeed differ very much in their Qualities, in different Countries and Climates; but tho&s;e of the Air are per|haps more different than tho&s;e of the Aliment. In peru&s;ing the Accounts of the Temper and Genius of the Inhabi|tants of different Countries, we di&s;cover in them a great Uniformity, even tho' the Race has been chang'd. The Tem|per of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> de&s;crib'd by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and other Writers, is much the &s;ame with that of the pre&s;ent <HI>French:</HI> There is a remarkable In&s;tance of this in the <HI>Mi|&s;opogon</HI> of the Emperor <HI>Julian;</HI> if I rightly remember, he tells us that he had pa&s;s'd a Winter at <HI>Paris,</HI> where there were more Comedians, Dancers,
<PB N="150" REF="163">
and Fidlers, than there were Citizens be&s;ides; and I believe if a Race of <HI>Laplanders</HI> were tran&s;planted thither, in a few Years they would be found in the Condition de&s;crib'd by the Emperor <HI>Ju|lian.</HI> How is the rugged Temper of the Northern Nation mellow'd by the &s;ofter Air of the Countries which they conquer'd? Governments &s;tamp the Manners, but cannot change the Genius and Temper of the Inhabitants; and as far as they are unre&s;train'd by Laws, their Pa&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently their National Virtues and Vices will bear &s;ome Conformity with the Temperature of the Air. The Inhabitants of <HI>Cio</HI> are de&s;crib'd by the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> as loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute, and voluptuous, and &s;o they are at pre&s;ent; &s;ome modern Tra|vellers affirm, that there is a Softne&s;s in their Air that di&s;po&s;eth to a &s;ort of Indolence and Mirth. Nations, as well as Individuals, have their Con&s;titutional Vices; and I think there is no &s;tronger Proof of the Force of Chri&s;tian Mo|rality, than the Reformation it pro|duc'd in National Vices in primitive Times, when it was believ'd and practis'd in its Perfection.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. If we con&s;ider the Cau&s;es a&s;|&s;ign'd by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> of the different
<PB N="151" REF="164" MS="y">
Temper of the Inhabitants of different Climates, we &s;hall find them &s;ufficient|ly proportion'd to their Effects. In Northern Countries, where the Altera|tions of the Height of the Barometer, and con&s;equently of the Weight of the Air, are frequent and great, the Fibres of Human Bodies are in a continual o&s;cillatory Motion, from a Pre&s;&s;ure of 1200, 1800, yea 3600 more at one time than another; and tho' this, by the Softne&s;s and Rarity of the Fluid, is in|&s;en&s;ible, and not dolorifick, it is a &s;ort of Exerci&s;e which the Inhabitants of Countries where the Variation of the Height of the <HI>Mercury</HI> is &s;mall or no|thing. By the Difference of the Ten&s;ion of the Fibres, the whole nervous Sy|&s;tem, and the animal Spirits, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure affected. Let us again con&s;ider the Extremes of Heat and Cold in great Latitudes, operating after the &s;ame manner, relaxing and con&s;tring|ing the Fibers by turns, and the extreme Cold acting likewi&s;e as a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> in con&s;equence of which we find an Acti|vity and Tolerance of Motion and La|bour, in dry fro&s;ty Weather, more than in hot; whereas the People within the Tropicks are con&s;tantly in the State of our hotte&s;t Weather. Whoever con&s;iders
<PB N="152" REF="165">
Mankind in &s;uch different Circum|&s;tances, will find that the Temper, both of their Body and Mind, mu&s;t be dif|ferent, and that a greater Variety in the o&s;cillatory Motion of the Fibres of Northern People mu&s;t produce the &s;ame in their Spirits, and therefore a propor|tional Inequality in their Pa&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently greater Activity and Cou|rage. That the Inhabitants of Climates, where the Difference of the Weight, Heat, and Cold of the Air is but &s;mall, feel only the Changes of the Ten&s;ion of their Fibres, proceeding from Drought and Moi&s;ture, being free from the Agi|tations and unea&s;y Sen&s;ations of North|ern People, proceeding from the Cau&s;es above enumerated; and the Motions of their Fibres and Spirits being more uni|form, they may be for that Rea&s;on, and from exce&s;&s;ive Heats, lazy and in|dolent: From Inactivity and Indolence there will follow naturally a flavi&s;h Di&s;|po&s;ition, or an Aver&s;ion to contend with &s;uch as have got the Ma&s;tery of them. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> owe their Courage to the Varie|ty and Coldne&s;s of their Climate, and their Laws which &s;ecure their Proper|ty to their Courage. Thus far I have ventur'd to explain the Philo&s;ophy of this
<PB N="153" REF="166">
&s;agacious old Man, by mechanical Cau&s;es ari&s;ing from the Properties and Quali|ties of the Air; to which I &s;hall add another, &s;omewhat foreign to my Sub|ject: That in Countries which do not produce without much Labour, the Land-holder mu&s;t have A&s;&s;urance of the Nece&s;&s;aries for his Culture, as his Seed, Granary, domicile Working-tools, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This mu&s;t create &s;ome Property, and where there is Property, there mu&s;t be Laws to &s;ecure it: From which I beg leave to draw one Corollary; That de|&s;potick Governments, tho' de&s;tructive of Mankind in general, are mo&s;t improper in cold Climates; for where great Labour is nece&s;&s;ary, the Workman ought to have a certain Title to the Fruits of it. There are Degrees of Slavery, and, generally &s;peaking, it is mo&s;t extreme in &s;ome hot and fruitful Countries.</P>
<P N="20">XX. I will venture to add another Ob&s;ervation, which, tho' it may &s;eem a little too much refin'd, is not improba|ble: That the Air has an Influence in forming the Languages of Mankind: The &s;errated clo&s;e way of Speaking of Northern Nations, may be owing to their Reluctance to open their Mouth wide in cold Air, which mu&s;t make their Language abound in Con&s;onants;
<PB N="154" REF="167">
whereas from a contrary Cau&s;e, the In|habitants of warmer Climates open|ing their Mouths, mu&s;t form a &s;ofter Language, abounding in Vowels. Ano|ther Ob&s;ervation is, That People in windy Countries naturally &s;peak loud, to make them&s;elves be heard in the open Air.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That the Con&s;titutions of Man|kind differ according to the Qualities of the Air in which they live, is an un|conte&s;ted Matter of Fact, and depends upon obvious Cau&s;es. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> ob|&s;erv'd, That the Inhabitants of moi&s;t Countries were bloated, leucophlegma|tick, and dull, from the Relaxation of their Fibres, and the Moi&s;ture imbib'd with the Air; and contrary Cau&s;es mu&s;t produce contrary Effects: Heat indeed relaxeth the Fibres, but by ab&s;orbing the Moi&s;ture may likewi&s;e harden, and ren|der them more &s;olid. The Bones of Animals in hot Countries are more &s;o|lid, and &s;pecifically heavier, than of tho&s;e in cold Climates, as may be &s;een in comparing the Bones of the Limbs of <HI>African</HI> Hor&s;es, and tho&s;e of North|ern Countries. The Blood too, in hot Countries, is thicker and blacker by the Di&s;&s;ipation of the &s;erous Part, by &s;en&s;i|ble Per&s;piration: This is Matter of Fact,
<PB N="155" REF="168">
atte&s;ted by Phy&s;icians who have practi|&s;ed in tho&s;e hot Countries. From this black adu&s;t State of their Blood, they are atrabilarious. Great Heats exalt the Bile, by di&s;&s;ipating the Moi&s;ture which dilutes it. Bile, of it &s;elf, is the mo&s;t unper&s;pirable of Animal Fluids; it &s;tops at the Surface of the Skin, and di&s;co|lours it. The Animal Juices, in hot Countries, are more exalted; this is true in venomous Creatures. There is &s;ome Analogy between Plants and Animals, and both are longer in coming to Ma|turity in cold and moi&s;t Air. The pro|lifick Age of Mankind is much earlier in hot than cold Countries, the Fe|males being in that State at Ten Years of Age. The Inhabitants of warm Countries are not &s;ubject to be fat, for a &s;trong Per&s;piration keeps an Animal from being &s;o. A copious Diet and Inactivity will always occa&s;ion Excep|tions from the general Rule.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. Cold and moi&s;t Air mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily produce phlegmatick and lax Con&s;titutions, and by &s;topping Per&s;pira|tion with a copious Diet, accumulate the Animal Oil. Dry and cold Air in a Degree tolerable to Human Bodies, which is the State of our Winter Fro&s;ts, creates a &s;trict Con&s;titution of the Fi|bres,
<PB N="156" REF="169">
and all the Effects thereon depend|ing, Vigour and Activity.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. As to different Heights and Regions of the Air, it &s;eems probable that the Con&s;titutions of Miners and Mountaineers mu&s;t differ con&s;iderably; and I wi&s;h the Differences were well ob&s;erv'd. Mountaineers, by having a le&s;s Pre&s;&s;ure of Air upon them, mu&s;t exert a greater Degree of Mu&s;cular Strength, like Birds who move in a ra|rer Element, and by &s;teep A&s;cents and De&s;cents a greater Variety and Force in progre&s;&s;ive Motion. The Coldne&s;s of their Air in &s;ome mea&s;ure balanceth the deficient Pre&s;&s;ure by Weight. The&s;e Cau&s;es naturally produce Strength and Activity; and even the Pride and Fe|rocity a&s;crib'd to them by <HI>Hippocrates.</HI> As Air has a great Influence upon the Fluids and Solids of Human Bodies, it will &s;tamp and form them according to its mo&s;t permanent State, during the Cycle or Period of the Sea&s;on in that Region of the Earth. But leaving this Matter to be further pur&s;ued when there are more <HI>Data</HI> from Natural Hi&s;tory to proceed upon, I &s;hall make a few Ob|&s;ervations upon the Qualities of the Air, as far as they are No&s;opoetick, that is, have a Power of producing Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="157" REF="170">
XXIV. Popular Di&s;ea&s;es depend up|on what is common to all the People; the&s;e are chiefly Air and Aliment; it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the Effects of both. The genuine Effects of Air in produ|cing Di&s;ea&s;es is be&s;t di&s;cover'd in People who live on whol&s;om Aliment, and are temperate.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. Acute popular Di&s;ea&s;es are commonly the Effects of the Tempe|rature of the Air; they often invade at &s;tated Sea&s;ons of the Year; their Rife|ne&s;s, Duration, different Symptoms and Periods, &s;eem to depend upon the Al|terations of the Weather, and the State of the Air preceding and con&s;equent up|on the&s;e Alterations. I think this may be inferr'd from the great Uniformity that is ob&s;erv'd in the Symptoms of the Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame Sea&s;on. I believe no body doubts that the late Di&s;temper which affected all <HI>Europe,</HI> was the pure and genuine Effect of the State of the Air. A Per&s;on in perfect Health going into a Place infected with an epidemical Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hall be &s;eiz'd with it without any other Error in his Diet, and even without Su&s;picion of In|fection.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. As the Force of Human Bo|dies is limited, they are not capable to
<PB N="158" REF="171">
bear Extremities of any kind, of too great Rarity, Den&s;ity, Heat, Cold, Moi|&s;ture, Drought in the Air. From the &s;ame Cau&s;e Human Bodies do not ea|&s;ily &s;u&s;tain violent and &s;udden Changes which agitate the Fluids and Solids too much; for as the State of our Fluids and Solids change with the Air, violent Alterations in the latter produce the &s;ame in the former; therefore variable Weather is commonly productive of Di&s;ea&s;es; for Example: Suppo&s;e &s;uch a State of the Air as maketh a great Stricture of all the external Parts of the Body, and con&s;equently an Abate|ment of the Circulation in the Ve&s;&s;els expo&s;ed to the Air, and in tho&s;e which immediately communicate with them: Suppo&s;e again the Air is &s;uddenly chang'd from this State to one which violently relaxeth the Fibres, by their Relaxation, it is po&s;&s;ible that the Ve&s;&s;els which were de&s;tin'd before to carry the Serum, or Lymph, may admit the Blood, which is an inflammatory State: Accordingly we find that inflammatory Di&s;tempers of &s;everal kinds are rife in moi&s;t and warm Weather, preceded by hard and la&s;ting Fro&s;ts: Fro&s;t &s;tops the Per&s;pi|ration of the Earth, which being re&s;tor'd by Thaw, fills the Air with an unu|&s;ual
<PB N="159" REF="172">
Quantity of Vapours, which affect Human Bodies, not only by Relaxation, but as they imbibe them with the Air.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The Weather and Di&s;ea&s;es of Countries have a good deal of Uni|formity; but the unu&s;ual Exce&s;&s;es of Heat, Cold, Moi&s;ture, and Drought, produce either a greater Plenty, or un|u&s;ual Symptoms in Di&s;ea&s;es; and operate more &s;trongly, if the Alterations are &s;ud|den and extreme.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. By the Doctrine and Ob&s;er|vations of Chap. III. it is plain that Human Bodies cannot long &s;u&s;tain Heat approaching to their natural Heat, far le&s;s that exceeding it. An Animal dies of an Inflammatory Di&s;temper with all the Symptoms of Putrefaction in a Su|gar-Baker's Drying-Room. There are &s;ome Countries in which, during their greate&s;t Heats, Wax will melt; Man|kind, without &s;ome Defences by Art, cannot bear &s;uch an Air. The Symp|toms which one feels in extremely hot Weather are feveri&s;h, a Pul&s;e quicker than natural, profu&s;e Sweats, great Thir&s;t, Debility, Dejection of Appetite; by great Sweats the Blood is render'd den&s;e; by Debility the Force of the Heart it&s;elf is dimini&s;h'd; and indeed by the Conti|nuance of the Heat, the whole Body in
<PB N="160" REF="173">
time may be render'd dry and &s;qualid; add to this, &s;udden Refrigeration by cool Air, &s;o de&s;irable to Mankind in &s;uch a State, for the &s;ake of which they often incautiou&s;ly expo&s;e them&s;elves: I &s;ay it is very accountable how &s;uch a Con&s;ti|tution of the Air may work as a <HI>Sti|mulus,</HI> and produce dangerous continued Fevers; and that Catarrhs, and Di&s;ea&s;es depending upon Defluxions of Sero&s;ity upon any Part of the Body, in Coughs, Rheumati&s;ms, Gouts, Diarrhoeas, &s;hould in &s;uch a Con&s;titution much abound, both by Suppre&s;&s;ion of Per&s;piration, and by a &s;udden Admi&s;&s;ion, imbibing of this Sero&s;ity by all the Pores of the Skin, of cool Air, and then he may undergo all tho&s;e Symptoms in a greater Degree; accordingly, hot Days, with cool Nights, are commonly productive of Diarrhoeas, &s;uch is our Weather in the <HI>Autumn.</HI></P>
<P N="29">XXIX. Heat, (as was ob&s;erv'd Numb. XIX. of this Chapter) naturally exalts the Bile; therefore bilious Fevers, and <HI>Cholera Morbus,</HI> may be the natural Product of &s;uch a hot Con&s;titution of Air.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Cold both congeals the Fluids and con&s;tringeth the Solids. It acts like a &s;mall Ligature upon the Ve&s;&s;els, by which the Circulation through the Ve&s;|&s;els
<PB N="161" REF="174">
is retarded; the natural Effect of which is a greater Secretion of Sero&s;ity through the Glands contiguous, for the Extremities of the Ve&s;&s;els near the Glands being pre&s;s'd, they cannot &s;o plentifully carry off the refluent Fluid, by which there mu&s;t be a greater Flux of Liquor towards the Glands, and a greater con&s;equently from its Emuncto|ries; therefore Catarrhs, or &s;erous De|fluxions upon all the Parts of the Body, but e&s;pecially from the Glands of the Head and Throat, are a natural Effect of Cold.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Ob&s;tructions by Cold in the outward Parts of the Body, drive the Blood pre&s;&s;ing with a greater Force upon the inward Parts, and increa&s;e Heat. Sizy Blood may be another Ef|fect of Cold; this is extremely well il|lu&s;trated by the ingenious Dr. <HI>Thomas Sim&s;on Chandos,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick in the Univer&s;ity of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> who has explain'd the Effects of Cold up|on the Humours very clearly, by a plain Experiment &s;hewing that Blood, after a &s;trong Ligature upon any Joint, will be &s;izy upon the letting it out of the Vein with a free Stream; and the Pro|fe&s;&s;or rea&s;ons very ju&s;tly, if the white. Chyle is made red by the Force of
<PB N="162" REF="175">
Motion, by the Retardation of this Cir|culation, in &s;ome Parts the Blood may grow white, and crude again: Cold is a &s;mall &s;ort of Ligature upon the Ve&s;|&s;el affected with it, con&s;tringing the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. It was ob&s;erv'd, N^o XXII. Chap. III. That the&s;e Qualities of the Air act either by the Sums or their Differences, as they con&s;pire in the &s;ame Effect, or act oppo&s;itely. Thus Heat and Moi&s;ture both relax; but if the Air is cold with Moi&s;ture, in that Ca&s;e the Ve&s;&s;els may be con&s;tringed, and &s;uch a Con&s;titution may produce all the Effects of Cold. Water relaxeth all Fibres, Vegetable and Animal; yet a cold Bath con&s;tringeth the Fibres for a while; any moi&s;t Steam relaxeth in Proportion to its Heat; be&s;ides, Water may ob&s;truct as well as relax.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. The more pliant the Ve&s;|&s;els are, as in tender and young Peo|ple, they are more &s;en&s;ible of Impre&s;|&s;ions by the outward Air; they have a greater Play in the Degrees of Ten|&s;ion than the Ve&s;&s;els of old People; therefore the Qualities of the Air in con&s;tringing and relaxing the Fibres pro|duce greater Effects upon them; the longer Animal Fibres are kept in any
<PB N="163" REF="176">
State, the more they lo&s;e their Power of re&s;toring them&s;elves: Therefore the mo&s;t permanent State of the Air of any Country may produce endemial chroni|cal Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. Cold is capable of produ|cing all the Di&s;ea&s;es which depend up|on too great a Stricture of the Fibres, and by dimini&s;hing the Quantity of Per&s;piration, either increa&s;eth that of the other Secretions, or produceth a greater Fulne&s;s and inward Heat. The Summer Per&s;piration being near double of that of Winter, the Appetite, and con|&s;equently the Aliment, not dimini&s;h'd, may induce all the Symptoms of a Plethora, if the other Secretions are not proportionally increas'd.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. Cold, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Per|&s;piration of Salts in the Blood, by con|gealing the Blood, and likewi&s;e by a dolorifick <HI>Stimulus</HI> corroding the Skin, is apt to produce Scurvies and other cutaneous Irruptions, and in Extremity is capable of freezing the Fluids, and re|ducing Animal Sub&s;tances to a gangrenous State.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Cold Air is capable of ma|king inflammatory Di&s;tempers with cu|taneous Irruptions more dangerous, by hindering the Relaxation of the Skin.
<PB N="164" REF="177">
I believe it will be found that the Small-pox is mo&s;t fatal during hard Fro&s;ts, and cold North-Ea&s;terly Winds. I re|member that the Small-pox which were exceeding mortal during &s;uch a Sea&s;on, grew more favourable by the Tepor and Moi&s;ture in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May.</HI> The artificial Qualities produc'd in the Air of the Patient's Room, are not &s;uffi|cient to balance its natural State.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. Cold Air, by its immedi|ate Contact with the Surface of the Lungs, is capable of abating or &s;top|ping the Circulation of the Blood, and bringing them into an inflammatory State, and by producing Catarrhs and Coughs, is productive of all the Effects of &s;uch Defluxions upon the Lungs, Ul|cerations, and all &s;orts of pulmonick Con|&s;umptions.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. As to Moi&s;ture and Drought, the Exce&s;&s;es of them mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bring Human Bodies into a morbid State, becau&s;e they are incapable of bearing the&s;e Extremes. There is a certain De|gree of Humidity nece&s;&s;ary to relax the outward Parts of the Body, to pre&s;erve the Pores of the Skin in their due Sy|metry; the &s;ame due Degree of Humi|dity is perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to be ab&s;orb'd with the Air, by the Pores of the Skin.</P>
<P N="39"><PB N="165" REF="178">
XXXIX. Long Droughts have been found mo&s;t dangerous of all to Human Bodies. The Year 1708, the colde&s;t Winter that perhaps was ever felt in <HI>England,</HI> was not attended with any great Mortality among&s;t Mankind. The Year following, 1709, was the wette&s;t that was ever known, there having fall'n about 26&frac12; Inches of Rain in <HI>E&s;|&s;ex,</HI> yet there were no extraordinary Di&s;|ea&s;es nor Mortality that Year; the Year &s;ucceeding, indeed the Small-pox were rife and mortal. The Year 1714 was the drie&s;t Year that has been yet ob&s;erv'd, there having fall'n that Year in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> not much above 11 Inches of Rain; &s;o that the Difference as to Moi|&s;ture, between 1709 and 1714, was a|bove Half, and their Proportion as 53 to 24; the Bills of Mortality in <HI>London,</HI> in 1714, increas'd 5512, and the Mor|tality begun that Year among&s;t the Cattle. There has been an unu&s;ual Drought for the&s;e two Years pa&s;t, for I think the be&s;t E&s;timation of the Dry|ne&s;s of the Surface of the Earth, mu&s;t be taken from the Falling of the Springs, the Con&s;equence of which has been un|u&s;ual Di&s;ea&s;es among&s;t &s;everal Animals, and a great Mortality among&s;t Mankind. It is true, this did not happen during
<PB N="166" REF="179">
the dry Weather; the &s;udden Alteration, as well as the preceding State, might operate, the Surface of the Earth being by the Drought fir&s;t &s;hut up, and af|terwards opened by the Rain, might af|fect Human Bodies variou&s;ly, as in warm Weather, and Thaws after great Fro&s;ts.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Moi&s;ture relaxeth, unle&s;s it be combin'd with a greater Degree of Cold, which &s;ubducts &s;o much of its relaxing Quality. The Inhabitants of cold and moi&s;t Countries are leucophlegmatick, bloated, and have all the Symptoms of Relaxation; therefore Effects of &s;uch a State of Air are all the Di&s;ea&s;es which the Methodi&s;ts cla&s;s under the Title of the <HI>Laxum.</HI> If Air is imbib'd by Hu|man Bodies, the watery Parts, and per|haps the&s;e chiefly, enter; and catarrhous Di&s;tempers &s;eem to depend upon the Moi&s;ture, as well as the Coldne&s;s of the Air. The lea&s;t Moi&s;ture taken in by the Windpipe, immediately is reject|ed by Coughing. It is not merely the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Per&s;piration by Cold or Moi&s;ture, that is the Cau&s;e of the Coughs and Defluxions upon the Brea&s;t, by in|ducing a Plethora, and a proportional one in the Glands; but the moi&s;t Air is really imbib'd, and affects the Glands by
<PB N="167" REF="180">
immediate Contact, or as a <HI>Stimulus.</HI> It appears by the Journals of Per&s;pira|tion, that Coughs and Colds have often invaded, where there was no Suppre&s;|&s;ion of Per&s;piration, and that a Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Per&s;piration is not always attended with a Cough or a Cold. Moi|&s;ture imbib'd with the Air, after Relax|ation of the Pores of the Skin, may affect all the glandulous Parts of the Body, even tho&s;e of the Guts, produ|cing Diarrhoeas. I know it to be true by Experience, that moi&s;t Air is pro|ductive of nephritick Colicks, in &s;uch as are &s;ubject to them. However, I propo&s;e this as a Probability, which by future Ob&s;ervations and Experiments may be better cleared.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. Hot and moi&s;t Air producing Relaxations, and con&s;equently an Abate|ment of the Force of the Solids in pro|pelling the Fluids mu&s;t produce Stagna|tion, Tumors, and Putrefaction in the Liquids, and all the other Di&s;ea&s;es de|pending upon a lax State of Fibres: <HI>Hippocrates</HI> ob&s;erv'd &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es al|ways con&s;equent upon a moi&s;t Con&s;ti|tution of Air, with Southerly Winds, which are warm; and I have ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame in this Country. As Per&s;pira|tion is the la&s;t Action of perfect Animal
<PB N="168" REF="181">
Dige&s;tion, that Con&s;titution of Air which &s;uppre&s;&s;eth Per&s;piration mu&s;t hin|der Dige&s;tion; therefore cold and moi&s;t Air mu&s;t be hurtful to Stomachicks. Ca|tarrhs and Coughs are the Effect of cold and moi&s;t Air, and tho&s;e habitually af|fecting the Lungs may produce pulmo|nick Con&s;umptions; yet it &s;eems proba|ble, that where tho&s;e Con&s;umptions are a popular Di&s;ea&s;e, they proceed from &s;ome particular Acrimony in the Air of that Country, affecting that tender Or|gan by immediate Contact, and perhaps all the Glands of the Body, for our Con&s;umptions are &s;crophulous. Scro|phulous Di&s;tempers are very common in this Country. If the Air be charg'd with any &s;aline acid Particles, they will naturally coagulate the Fluid where they touch. From the Abundance of Mine|ral Waters of all &s;orts in <HI>England,</HI> it may be inferr'd, that there are abundance of Mineral Steams.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. The Chirurgeons prove the Ef|fects of Air in their Profe&s;&s;ion, even more than the Phy&s;icians; for when the Fi|bres of Human Bodies gape, by a Wound or Sore, the outward Air has an im|mediate Acce&s;s to the open Ve&s;&s;els, and affects the Fluids in them by immediate Contact, and affects a wounded Part as
<PB N="169" REF="182">
it were raw Fle&s;h: The Healing of this Wound, or the Union of its Parts, is perform'd by the Elongation of the Fibres, and that depends both upon the State of the influent Fluid and its va&s;|cular Fibres, as to Flexibility, Rigidity, Strength, or Degrees of Re&s;i&s;tance; and tho&s;e depend very much upon the Air, which is in immediate Contact: For Example, A Wound in cold fro&s;ty Wea|ther mu&s;t gape more, becau&s;e the Cold contracts the Fibres more than tepid Weather, therefore in the latter the Fi|bres mu&s;t be more pliant and flexible; &s;uch a Con&s;titution of the Air as would naturally putrify raw Fle&s;h, mu&s;t en|danger by a Mortification. Defences by Empla&s;tick Applications are not &s;uffi|cient to defend a Wound or Sore from being affected with the Air which touch|eth it; therefore Chirurgeons are &s;ome|what nice in the Choice of the Sea&s;ons in which they perform certain Opera|tions. From the Qualities of the Air it happens that Wounds in different Parts of the Body are &s;ome ea&s;ier, &s;ome harder to be cur'd in different Countries. An eminent Chirurgeon of our Army, du|ring the la&s;t War with <HI>France,</HI> was pleas'd to tell me two very remarkable Things relating to this Subject: One
<PB N="170" REF="183">
was, That after the Battle of <HI>Hoch&s;ted,</HI> the Wounded in the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Nor|lingen</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> fell all into adema|tous Swellings, of which many mi&s;car|ried; that after they were remov'd into another Air, this Symptom went off. Another Ob&s;ervation was, That at the Siege of <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> there was a great Di&s;po&s;ition in every Wound to turn gangrenous, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the Head, &s;o that few re|cover'd of tho&s;e that were trepan'd. This he ob&s;erv'd to be peculiar either to that Sea&s;on, or to that Place. In the Ho&s;pitals at <HI>Paris,</HI> Wounds in the Head are much di&s;pos'd to Gangrenes.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. From what has been &s;aid on the Subject of the Effects of the Air on Human Bodies, it is plain that no vi|tious State, either of the Solids or Flu|ids, but is producible by the common Properties and Qualities of Air, and their Changes and Combinations. By the Qualities of Air the &s;olid Parts may be &s;timulated: For Example, The <HI>Sti|mulus</HI> of extreme Cold is very &s;en&s;ible: Heat, or any Quality of Air &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to produce a dolorifick Sen&s;ation, acts as a <HI>Stimulus:</HI> What ob&s;tructs the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Ve&s;&s;els which communi|cate with the Air, is &s;timulating, by in|crea&s;ing the Force of the Heart and the
<PB N="171" REF="184">
Fibres to overcome the Ob&s;truction; this either Cold or Moi&s;ture may do, which often produce, fir&s;t Chilne&s;s, and then a &s;ucceeding Heat, which are fe|veri&s;h Symptoms: Many volatile Parti|cles floating in the Air, as the odorife|rous of Vegetables, act as a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> and we find can produce Headaches: That the Fibres are con&s;tringed and relaxed by the Alternations of the Properties and Qualities of the Air we have already de|mon&s;trated: That the Fluids may be vi|tiated in the &s;ame manner, is no le&s;s plain: That the Blood may be conden&s;ed by Heat, by ab&s;orbing the mo&s;t fluid Part: That a certain Degree of Heat will attenuate, and a greater coagulate the <HI>Se|rum;</HI> and Heat in general is capable of producing great Acrimony and putrid Fevers of all &s;orts, is true from Expe|rience, and any Degree of Heat greater than that of a Human Body will do &s;o; for our natural Heat is near the Degree of Coagulation. Cold likewi&s;e conden&s;eth the Fluids in immediate Contact with it. Cold is capable of producing Sizene&s;s and Vi&s;co&s;ity in the Blood. By the &s;ame Cau&s;es, Acrimony of all &s;orts, to the Degree of Putrefaction, is producible by Air. Evacuations of all &s;orts, from all the glandulous Parts of the Body, are
<PB N="172" REF="185">
producible by the Stoppage of Per&s;pira|tion: For Example, There is no diure|tick Medicine which works &s;o &s;trong in a Flux of Urine, as a Suppre&s;&s;ion of per&s;pirable Matter in Hy&s;terical Ca&s;es. Cold promotes all Catarrhs, Coughs; and moi&s;t Air, Diarrhoeas, and copious Se|cretions from the Glands of the Guts; without which Evacuations, Stoppage of Per&s;piration produceth a Plethora or Ac|cumulation of the Humours in the Ve&s;|&s;els. From the&s;e Con&s;iderations it ap|pears that the Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially the a|cute of any Sea&s;on, chiefly depend upon the Con&s;titution of the Air, by which they are modify'd, as to their Rifene&s;s, Duration, Degrees of Danger, their par|ticular Symptoms, Circulations and Pe|riods: In which we mu&s;t not only con|&s;ider the pre&s;ent, but the preceding State of the Air, becau&s;e, as they are more &s;i|milar or contrary, the Alterations pro|duc'd in Human Bodies, are le&s;s or more violent; particularly, I believe it will be found that &s;udden Changes from the Ex|tremes of Cold and Dry to Heat and Moi&s;ture, are Cau&s;es which operate &s;trongly in modifying the Di&s;ea&s;es of that Sea&s;on: That long and exce&s;&s;ive Heats, by inducing Debility, are apt to &s;tamp the &s;ucceeding Fevers with nervous Symp|toms:
<PB N="173" REF="186">
That &s;uch a dry Con&s;titution of Air as is apt to curb the Skin, and ob|&s;truct its Pores, makes the Cri&s;is by Sweating more difficult; perhaps the different Periods of Fevers, Quotidian, Tertian, Quartan, may depend upon a preceding greater Vi&s;co&s;ity, or Ob&s;truc|tion in the Ve&s;&s;els, produc'd by the Con|&s;titution of the Air: That the more dangerous State of Small-pox, and other inflammatory cutaneous Irruptions, de|pends upon the Air, I think, &s;eems very plain, as it induceth a greater Laxity or Stricture of the Fibres, or creates a greater Ob&s;truction in the Ve&s;&s;els of the Skin: That Di&s;ea&s;es of the Lungs, as far as they are not the Product of bad Diet, depend chiefly upon the Qua|lities of the Air, &s;eems evident; the Lungs are expos'd to the outward Air, which has an immediate Admi&s;&s;ion in|to the Air-bladders, and perhaps into the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; and whatever Effect the Air has upon the Skin, this mu&s;t be expected upon the Lungs in a par|ticular manner. It is needle&s;s to enu|merate many Particulars, which the Reader may ea&s;ily collect from the Chap|ter that treats of Re&s;piration.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. I have hitherto con&s;ider'd on|ly the common Properties and Qualities
<PB N="174" REF="187">
of the Air which are &s;en&s;ible, and &s;hewn that they are productive of all the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es, and for which there is no Occa&s;ion to have Recour&s;e to its Qualities, occult or extraordinary, which probably it is often endued with; For be&s;ides the Qualities of hot, cold, moi&s;t, dry, the Air may be &s;aline, oily, both which Qualities it di&s;covers &s;ome|times by its Effects on Bodies; be&s;ides, from the Action of the heterogeneous Bodies contain'd in it, &s;ome new Sub|&s;tances may be produc'd of a Nature different from the Ingredients. The &s;aline Exhalations from the Earth may be different at different times; &s;uch Salts exhal'd at particular times from the Earth, may enter Human Bodies, and operate like Poi&s;ons, and &s;uddenly infect the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, as the Venom of a poi&s;onous Animal, or as other Sub|&s;tances injected into the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, which produce immediately mortal Symp|toms; or they may operate more &s;lowly, and produce unu&s;ual Di&s;ea&s;es. This is not an impo&s;&s;ible nor improbable Suppo|&s;ition; yet there is no Nece&s;&s;ity always to have Recour&s;e to it, there being no Change in Human Bodies known, but is producible by the Contents, Proper|ties, and Qualities, which we are &s;ure
<PB N="175" REF="188">
the Air is endued with, and e&s;pecially by their great Enormities and &s;udden Suc|ce&s;&s;ions and Alternations; to &s;uch occult Qualities in the Air, many have a&s;crib'd Plagues and Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers, up|on which I &s;hall make a few Remarks in the following Chapter.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP VII. Remarks on the Pe&s;t and Pe&s;tilential Fe|vers, as far as they are influenc'd by the Air.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT it is very difficult to come at Truth in the Hi&s;tory of Plagues; this is not to be wonder'd at, con&s;idering the Terror, Super&s;tition, and Credulity of the Vulgar, and the publick Di&s;order during Pe&s;tilential Sea&s;ons. There never was any Plague better at|tended, nor better inquired into by Phy|&s;icians, than the la&s;t of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> yet the Facts (e&s;pecially tho&s;e relating to its original Cau&s;e) a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome of the Town Phy&s;icians, are as po&s;itively de|ny'd by the Phy&s;icians &s;ent down by the Regent, and perhaps upon a more exact Inquiry, and better Evidence.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="176" REF="189" MS="y">
II. There is &s;omething infamous as well as terrible in the Plague, &s;o that no Nation will own it to be natural to their Country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;per Alpinus.</NOTE> The <HI>Egyptians</HI> affirm it is brought to them from <HI>Barbary, Sy|ria,</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI> The People again, in and about <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> affirm as con|fidently, that it is brought to them from <HI>Egypt.</HI> As far as the Plague depends up|on the Air, the&s;e Que&s;tions &s;eem natu|rally to ari&s;e: Whether any Con&s;titu|tion of Air is capable of producing it in a Place where it was not brought by Infection? What Influence the Air has in propagating it? In a Matter both &s;o uncertain and important, I &s;hall hardly venture to determine po&s;itively, but lay the Evidence fairly before the Reader, and leave him to judge. And for the &s;ake of &s;ome Readers, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to explain &s;ome Terms of Art.</P>
<P N="3">III. An Endemial Di&s;ea&s;e is what is common to the People of the Country. A Di&s;ea&s;e is Epidemical, when it affects Multitudes, at any particular Sea&s;on or Time. A Sporadical Di&s;ea&s;e is an En|demial Di&s;ea&s;e, when in a particular Sea|&s;on affects but a few People. I &s;hall
<PB N="177" REF="190">
likewi&s;e beg leave to adopt another Word. An Indigenous Di&s;ea&s;e is what is natural only to one Country, and from it propa|gated to others by Infection: For Ex|ample, The Small-pox was perhaps a Di&s;ea&s;e indiginous to <HI>Arabia,</HI> and from thence propagated among&s;t all Mankind; but now in tho&s;e Places where it has once come, it may be properly &s;aid to be Endemial or Popular, but not Indi|genous; there is no need of any new In|fection from its Original Country to carry it on; and it has become almo&s;t univer|&s;al, mi&s;&s;ing few who live long enough to have it. This is manife&s;tly different from the Ca&s;e of the Plague; for tho' it has been at Times and great Intervals of Years in mo&s;t Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> and during tho&s;e Sea&s;ons Epidemical, yet one can hardly call it Endemial, except in &s;ome Places of <HI>Turkey.</HI> Where the Plague invades and goes off regularly at &s;tated Sea&s;ons, it is probably there both an Indiginous and Endemial Di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Plague &s;eems to be a parti|cular Di&s;ea&s;e, characteris'd with its pro|per Symptoms, which are nearly uni|form wherever it invades, an inflam|matory Di&s;temper, with Eruptions upon the external Parts of the Body, in Buboes,
<PB N="178" REF="191">
by the Inflammation and Suppuration of the axillary, inguinal, and other Glands, or in beginning Gangrenes, by Carbun|cles in &s;ome Parts, or Spots, red, livid, black, over all the Body; or la&s;tly, in <HI>Stigmata,</HI> or what they call the Tokens, which are Mortifications quite compleat, the Parts being in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Symptoms of the Plague re|&s;emble tho&s;e of other inflammatory Di&s;|tempers, with Eruptions, particularly <HI>St. Anthony's Fire,</HI> in which, after a con|tinued Fever of two Days, invading with a Rigor, there appears a Tumor, Di&s;colo|ration, and a &s;ort of Carbuncles upon the Skin at the &s;ame time; the axillary Glands are often inflam'd, and &s;ome|times &s;uppurated: This Analogy between the Plague and <HI>St. Anthony's Fire</HI> was ob&s;erv'd by Dr. <HI>Sydenham.</HI> There is the &s;ame Analogy between the Plague and the Small-pox; the Fever invades in both Ca&s;es with the &s;ame Symptoms; Pains in the Head, Back, Vomiting, Anxiety, &s;parkling Eyes, high Colour in the Face, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Fever after two Days pro|duceth, in the Plague, an Inflammation and Tumor in &s;ome Glands about the Head, Neck, Armpits, Groin; in the Small-pox the &s;ame in the Glands of the Skin: The&s;e Glands, in both Ca&s;es,
<PB N="179" REF="192">
&s;uppurating kindly, make what one may call a favourable Plague, or Small-pox; if tho&s;e Eruptions end in Gangrenes, in either Ca&s;e, it proves the Di&s;ea&s;e to be dangerous or mortal, according to the Number or Condition of them. The &s;udden Deaths in the Plague &s;eem, as in the Small-pox, of &s;uch as die in the fir&s;t Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e, only the Plague more malignant. The Progno|&s;ticks both in the Plague and Small-pox depend upon the &s;ame Principles, and the Danger in both to Subjects of the &s;ame kind: As to childing Women, young vigorous People after Irregulari|ties of Diet, in &s;uch it begins with Hae|morrages, e&s;pecially bloody Urine, &s;uch Symptoms being the Marks of the De|grees of Inflammation. A&s;triction of the Belly in the beginning of the Di&s;temper is good in both Ca&s;es. Buboes increa&s;ing fa&s;t, flatulent, without the natural In|flammation and Suppuration. Buboes too hard and horny, or with a Rainbow, that is, a Mortification about them, fa|tal in the Plague; in &s;hort, Buboes well inflam'd, producing a laudable Matter, generally end well. The&s;e Progno&s;ticks are analagous, and hold in the Small-pox: Nor do I mention the&s;e Things as &s;trange, &s;ince they depend upon the
<PB N="180" REF="193">
&s;ame Cau&s;es, but only to &s;hew that the Plague &s;eems to be an inflammatory Di&s;|temper of its own kind, like the Small-pox; the Havock made in the inward Parts by the Plague and Small-pox is much alike. What likewi&s;e proves the Plague to be a Species of Di&s;ea&s;e diffe|rent from all others, is, that if we can believe the Relations of Travellers, there are Countries where it never was at all, as the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies, China,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Timquine, Cochine China,</HI> and mo&s;t Places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Tho&s;e Con&s;iderations make it probable that it is a Di&s;ea&s;e indigenous to &s;ome Tract of Ground, and from thence propagated to other Places by Contagion: And yet,</P>
<P N="6">VI. As to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, Whether the Air is capable of producing the Plague without Infection, in a Place where it is not an endemial Di&s;ea&s;e, I think the Affirmative is very probable; for Fir&s;t, In a Country where it is both an indigenous and endemial Di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t be probably owing to &s;ome parti|cular Quality of the Air. Secondly, It has been prov'd by the Doctrine of the foregoing Part of this E&s;&s;ay, that there is hardly any Alteration, even to the ut|mo&s;t Degree of Putrefaction but may be produc'd by the Enormities, Combina|tions,
<PB N="181" REF="194">
and Alternations of the common Qualities of the Air; and that &s;till more extraordinary Effects may be produc'd by &s;ome Contagion of the Air, by uncom|mon Effluvia from Bodies near the Sur|face of the Earth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Mr. <HI>Boyle.</HI></NOTE> A Philo&s;opher mo&s;t learned in Phy&s;iology of the Air, gives In&s;tances of Steams of a particu|lar Nature, being emitted from the Earth at particular times; that Mines will emit Steams noxious to Vegetables at parti|cular times; that there may be indeed &s;ome Tracts of Ground free from &s;uch Minerals as emit tho&s;e noxious Effluvia, and con&s;equently free from the Plague, as proceeding from the local Qualities of their Air; but then tho&s;e Effluvia may be carried and mix'd with the Air of that Place by Winds. <HI>Mezeray</HI> tells us that the Plague which happen'd in <HI>France,</HI> in the Year 1346, the mo&s;t u|niver&s;al and fatal that ever was known, began in the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> by a Vapour mo&s;t horridly foetid, that break|ing out of the Earth, like a kind of &s;ubterraneal Fire, con&s;umed and devour|ed above 200 Leagues of that Country, even to the Trees and Stones, and in|fected the Air after a wonderful man|ner;
<PB N="182" REF="195">
that from thence it pa&s;s'd through <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Greece, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> The learned Philo&s;opher above-mention'd gives In&s;tances of the noxious Qualities, as well as abundance of &s;ome Minerals, particularly Orpiment; and of the Hurt|fulne&s;s of Ar&s;enick, worn outwardly in Amulets, producing all the Symptoms of the Plague, and which were cur'd by anti|pe&s;tilential and alexipharmick Remedies. There are credible Relations of Facts during the Plague of <HI>London,</HI> whereby it appear'd that the Air near pe&s;tiferous Hou&s;es di&s;colour'd the Walls. There is nothing improbable in the Hypothe&s;is of extraordinary Effluvia. Thirdly, Tho&s;e Plagues which have cut off the greate&s;t Part of Mankind, in different and di&s;tant Countries, without mutual Commerce, mu&s;t have an univer&s;al Cau&s;e, and there is hardly one imaginable be&s;ides Air. There were two &s;uch Plagues in the Time of <HI>Marc Anthony,</HI> and one in the Year 1450. Fourthly, There has been generally ob&s;erv'd &s;omething particular in the Sea&s;ons and Con&s;titutions of the Air, preceding the Plague, as great Droughts, la&s;ting Southerly Winds, &s;ome|times la&s;ting Calms; this was the Con|&s;titution always &s;u&s;pected by <HI>Hippocrates</HI> and other ancient Phy&s;icians; &s;uch was
<PB N="183" REF="196">
that before the Plague of <HI>Nimiguen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diemerbroke.</NOTE>. Great Droughts, as has been ob&s;erv'd before, have been always found noxious to Human Bodies. The Con&s;titution previous to the Plague of <HI>London,</HI> was very &s;ingular, a hard winter Fro&s;t, la&s;t|ing till near the End of <HI>March,</HI> a &s;ud|den Thaw, the Ground cover'd with Water from melted Snow and Ice, and great Heats &s;ucceeding, Mankind being as it were in a Room flooded with Wa|ter with a great Fire. In &s;ome Places it has been ob&s;erv'd, that the Exacerba|tion of the Di&s;ea&s;e kept time with the Lunations, raging mo&s;t at the New and Full Moons; that there has been in pe|&s;tilential Sea&s;ons an unu&s;ual Quantity of &s;ulphureous Vapours in the Air, Fle&s;h, and other animal Sub&s;tances putrifying &s;ooner than ordinary, wild Birds leaving the infected Places, and tame ones dying in their Cages; all other Di&s;ea&s;es being more rife and mortal, and, as it were, participating of the Plague. Before the Plague of <HI>London,</HI> Inflammations of the Lungs were rife and mortal, as were likewi&s;e the Meazles. Fifthly, What &s;eems to demon&s;trate that the Di&s;ea&s;e depends upon &s;ome noxious Quali|ty

of the Air, is not only the Sudden|ne&s;s of the Stroke, attended often with a Predi&s;po&s;ition of the Body: For Exam|ple, It has been ob&s;erv'd that any thing which induceth a &s;udden Change in the Motion or Qualities of the Blood, &s;ub|jects the Per&s;on to the Infection; in a Woman, Abortion, or Childbed, &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ions of Fear, Anger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all Exce&s;&s;es and Irregularities of Diet; young and florid Blood, rather than vapid and ca|chectical: All the&s;e Ca&s;es re&s;emble a &s;udden Taint of the animal Fluids by Air, as &s;ome Liquors are &s;poil'd by a Thunder-Storm, and, by the way, &s;eem to demon&s;trate, that the Contagion does not proceed from an animate Cau&s;e, for invi&s;ible In&s;ects would bite or &s;ting, whether a Per&s;on was in a Pa&s;&s;ion or Calm; for here is a Concurrence of a Di&s;po&s;ition in the Fluids with &s;omething which operates very &s;uddenly upon them, which can hardly be &s;uppos'd any thing be&s;ides Air, in&s;inuating &s;ome Poi&s;on like that of a venomous Animal, and tainting the Blood when it is mo&s;t agitated. Violent Exerci&s;e likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;eth to the Pe&s;tilential Infection, by admitting after it the Pe&s;tilential Air through the Pores of the Body. The Diet which promotes a generous Per&s;piration, with|out
<PB N="185" REF="198">
inflaming, is the be&s;t Pre&s;ervative, and the Poor who are unprovided with &s;uch Aliment, and mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Air, &s;uffer mo&s;t; during a copious Per|&s;piration, the outward Air is not &s;o much ab&s;orb'd, and the noxious Quali|ties of the Air affect tho&s;e who are mo&s;t expos'd to it. This agrees with Expe|rience, for the <HI>Europeans</HI> pre&s;erve them|&s;elves from the Plagues that rage in <HI>Turkey,</HI> by &s;hutting them&s;elves up, which perhaps operates not only as avoiding the infected People, but the tainted Air. The be&s;t Remedies in the Plague are Diaphoreticks, &s;uch as expel noxious Steams out of the Body. The&s;e Ob&s;er|vations &s;eem to point at the Air as the efficient Cau&s;e of the Plague; but &s;ome of them indeed do not prove more than that Air is the Medium through which the Infection is propagated. And Sixth|ly, It has been ob&s;erv'd that there is a great Analogy between the Symptoms of the Plague and <HI>St. Anthony's Fire,</HI> and that they differ only as to the Degrees of the Inflammation. Therefore I be|lieve hardly any one would venture to deny that a Con&s;titution of Air which makes <HI>St. Anthony's Fire</HI> epidemical and violent in its Symptoms, heighten'd in its malignant Qualities, might po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="186" REF="199">
carry the Eruptions upon the Skin from red to livid, from Inflammation to Mor|tification, and likewi&s;e the Inflamma|tion of the axillary and inguinal Glands to large Tumors and Suppurations, in which Ca&s;e it would be term'd the Plague. Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> ob&s;erves, that the epidemical Fever which preceded, attended, and &s;ucceeded the Plague of <HI>London,</HI> was the &s;ame with the Pe&s;ti|lential Fever, only during the Plague it was more violent, producing tho&s;e Erup|tions from which the Plague is denomi|nated. Seventhly, All the Symptoms of the Plague proceed from a high alka|line bilious Acrimony; this is evident from the Symptoms of the Di&s;ea&s;e, for one Effect is the &s;ame with the alkaline Salts, which rai&s;e an <HI>E&s;chare;</HI> and by Experiments made during the Plague of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> a &s;mall Quantity of the Gall of a pe&s;tiferous Body, mix'd with Water, and injected into the Vein of a Dog, infected immediately with all the Symptoms of the Plague, the Animal who had convers'd &s;afely before in the Ho&s;pitals of the Infected: Such a bi|lious Acrimony is certainly producible by Air, and by many other Cau&s;es: Be|&s;ides, what demon&s;trates a malignant Quality of the Air in a Pe&s;tilential Sea|&s;on,
<PB N="187" REF="200">
is the great Mortality of other Di&s;|ea&s;es; the whole Mortality during the Plague of <HI>London</HI> was 97306, the Mor|tality by the Plague 60506, whence the Mortality of other Di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have been 28710, con&s;idering the great Emp|tine&s;s of the City at that time. This mu&s;t needs have been above three times the common Proportion. From all the&s;e Con&s;iderations I think one may infer, that the Plague may be produc'd by &s;ome malignant Quality of the Air without any Contagion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But that the Air is the chief In&s;trument both of propagating and ex|tingui&s;hing it, I believe no Body can deny; and this mu&s;t be true from what Cau&s;e &s;oever you deduce the Plague; if from an animate Cau&s;e, as from invi&s;i|ble In&s;ects, the favourable Con&s;titution of the Air to their Propagation mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd; if from Infection of any kind, the Air is the Medium through which it is propagated, and mu&s;t favour it, more or le&s;s, in different Sea&s;ons, be|cau&s;e by the Change of the Qualities of the Air, it is quite extingui&s;h'd, and, generally &s;peaking, by Cold; after the Pe&s;tilential Sea&s;on is over, People return to their Hou&s;es with Safety. I believe one may &s;afely affirm, that there is hard|ly
<PB N="188" REF="201">
any Year in which there are not in <HI>London,</HI> Fevers, with Buboes and Car|buncles; and that there are many Pete|chial or Spotted Fevers, is certain. What &s;hall we call Di&s;ea&s;es with the &s;ame Symptoms, when they &s;eize many or few in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, when it &s;preads and turns epidemical and infec|tious, we call it the Plague; and when it does not &s;pread perhaps it is the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, only &s;poradical; all this depends upon the Con&s;titution of the Air.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It is no le&s;s clear that the Plague is often brought into infected Places by accident, and that it may, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be &s;pread by Con|tagion. <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> by its Commerce with <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> has been more frequently infected with the Plague than any City in <HI>Europe.</HI> There are upon the Records of that City, an Account of Twenty great Plagues. By the Hi&s;to|ries of Plagues, and particularly that la&s;t of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> the manner of &s;preading of the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to be gradual, at fir&s;t &s;eizing Hou&s;es, then Streets, Quar|ters of the Town, and at la&s;t, like an univer&s;al Conflagration, the whole City. What was remarkable in the Plague of <HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI> an open and airy Street,
<PB N="189" REF="202">
well perflated, where the better &s;ort of Inhabitants liv'd, was the la&s;t infected: This is ea&s;ily accounted for from what was &s;aid in the Fir&s;t Chapter, about the Noxiou&s;ne&s;s and Quantity of animal Steams. <HI>1&s;t.</HI> Let it be con&s;ider'd to what a large Extent the Effluvia of &s;ome Bodies will infect the Air; for Exam|ple, the Snuff of a Candle: By what was &s;aid in the Fir&s;t Chapter, the per|&s;pirable Matter of le&s;s than 3000 Hu|man Creatures would make an At|mo&s;phere 71 Feet high, over an Acre of Ground, in 34 Days. This per&s;pi|rable Fluid is to Air in Den&s;ity, per|haps as 800 to 1; therefore if you ex|tend the 3000 People over a hundred Acres of Ground, there will remain 8 Inches, the greate&s;t Part remaining un|blown off, and &s;pread with the infinite Tenuity of odorous Effluvia, will infect the whole Air of that City. It is ea&s;y to conceive how the Steams of pe&s;tife|rous Bodies may taint the Air, while they are alive and hot: but I think it appears likewi&s;e, by their being fre|quently opened and di&s;&s;ected in <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> without any Danger to the Chi|rurgeon or A&s;&s;i&s;tants; that there is no Danger from them when cold, and not putrify'd. I think, from the Facts above-mention'd,
<PB N="190" REF="203">
one may ea&s;ily account for the Propagation and Continuance of the Plague in &s;ome Places infected, and the Pre&s;ervation of neighbouring Places from the Infection; if there is no par|ticular Di&s;po&s;ition in the Air to propa|gate the Di&s;temper. Any infectious Di&s;|temper is ea&s;ily propagated among&s;t Human Creatures living clo&s;e together. The Plague of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> 1711, cut off the greate&s;t Part of the common Peo|ple, who are mo&s;t narrowly lodged in that City.</P>
<P N="9">IX. As to the Pe&s;tilential Levains con|vey'd in Goods, it is a popular and &s;afe Opinion; but many Writers about the Plague, and particularly <HI>Diemerbroke,</HI> &s;eem to de&s;pite it. The Fact of its be|ing brought into <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> by infected Goods, is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted by the Town Phy&s;icians, and as po&s;itively deny'd upon a &s;tricter Examination by tho&s;e &s;ent down by the Regent. In the la&s;t Plague of <HI>London,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> po&s;itively affirms that he &s;aw a Patient in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> with Carbuncles the Winter before the Plague broke out. As to the Plague being pro|pagated by infected Goods, there is this one Difficulty which is not ea&s;ily &s;olv'd. In a City infected with the Plague, notwith&s;tanding all the Pains taken by
<PB N="191" REF="204">
artificial Purifications to extirpate the Contagion, there mu&s;t be more of the pe&s;tilential Levain left in Goods, than could be brought over in a whole Fleet; yet when the pe&s;tilential Sea&s;on is over, People return to their Hou&s;es, lie in the infected Beds, and u&s;e the &s;ame Goods &s;afely: And indeed, if pe&s;tilential Le|vains were always capable of producing the Infection, I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible for the Plague ever to be ex|tingui&s;h'd in a Place once infected. So that I think one may conclude, That the Con&s;titution of the Air is the chief In&s;trument perhaps in producing, but &s;urely in propagating and extingui&s;hing this Di&s;temper, and that there is no need (with <HI>Diemerbroke</HI>) to have Re|cour&s;e to &s;ome miraculous Operation of Divine Vengeance. The mo&s;t common and feeble Powers of Nature are capable of executing the Will of the Creator, e|ven in the extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence. The Inhabitants of tho&s;e Countries which have never been afflicted with the Plague, are not le&s;s Sin|ners than others. I think it likewi&s;e probable that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Contempt of the Contagion does not propagate the Di&s;ea&s;e more than the Chri&s;tian Dread of it, which brings publick Di&s;order,
<PB N="192" REF="205">
want of Care both of the Sound and Infected; for in general Contagions, more peri&s;h for want of Care and Nece&s;&s;aries, than by the Malignity of the Di&s;ea&s;e; they being, as it were, &s;eque&s;trated from Mankind. In the Plague of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> many were buried alive. In the &s;ame Plague, when good Order was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, of above 15000 who had gent|ler Symptoms, and were better attended, the greate&s;t Part recover'd. If the <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> Principles were join'd with the Chri|&s;tian Care and Skill, no doubt the Ha|vock made by this Di&s;ea&s;e would be &s;mall, in re&s;pect of what it is commonly in in|fected Cities.</P>
<P N="10">X. As to the Method of Cure of this Di&s;temper, it is foreign to my Subject; only by the Conformity of its Symptoms with other inflammatory Di&s;tempers, e&s;pecially the Small-pox, the &s;ame Me|thods &s;eem be indicated in both. As to Pre&s;ervatives, there &s;eems &s;carce any to be depended upon, but Flight from the infected Place. As the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to produce a general Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood in Haemorrages of all kinds (even tho&s;e Inflammations upon the Skin are Extrava&s;ations of Blood ending in Mor|tifications) acid and &s;typtick Medicines are indicated, both as a Cure and Pre|&s;ervative,
<PB N="193" REF="206">
it has likewi&s;e been ob&s;erv'd by the Writers on this Di&s;ea&s;e, that it is apt to invade &s;uch as are &s;ubject to intermitting Fevers, which often dege|nerate into the Plague. There has late|ly been di&s;cover'd in the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark a Virtue to re&s;i&s;t and cure Mortifica|tions; and what cures a Symptom, may pre&s;erve from it: Therefore I would propo&s;e, in a pe&s;tilential Con&s;titution, the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark as an Antidote or Pre&s;ervative; it prevents as well as cures &s;ome &s;orts of Fevers; it tempers bilious Acrimony; is &s;typtick; cures Haemorra|ges and re&s;i&s;ts Mortifications; then why not u&s;e an Antidote &s;o promi&s;ing; if not effectual, at lea&s;t harmle&s;s. A Chirurgeon at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> told a Friend of mine, that he was &s;ure that he pre|&s;erv'd him&s;elf from the Plague by ta|king large Do&s;es of the Bark; and that it had its Effect after he felt him&s;elf attack'd with the fir&s;t Symptoms.</P>
<P N="11">XI. There have been of late two re|markable In&s;tances of the Influence of the Air in producing an Epidemical Di&s;|ea&s;e, perhaps over the greate&s;t Part of the Surface of the Earth; the fir&s;t hap|pen'd in the Year 1728; the la&s;t in the latter end of the Year 1732, and be|ginning of 1733; which being the more
<PB N="194" REF="207">
recent and remarkable, I &s;hall give a &s;hort De&s;cription of it, till a more par|ticular one can be procur'd from the collected Memoirs of the &s;everal Coun|tries which it invaded, of which I have &s;een only a few.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The previous Con&s;titution of the Air was, in <HI>England,</HI> and in the great|e&s;t Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> a great Drought, which may be inferr'd from the Failure of the Springs, in the Abatement of the fre&s;h Water in all its u&s;ual Cur|rents and Re&s;ervoirs, which are the be&s;t Mea&s;ure of the Quantity of Moi|&s;ture falling from the Clouds. What is mo&s;t generally taken notice of in the Accounts I have &s;een from <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and &s;ome other Places, was, That the Air in the beginning of Win|ter, e&s;pecially in <HI>November,</HI> was more than u&s;ually filled with thick and fre|quent Fogs, the Matter of which was not precipitated upon the Earth in Rain, Snow, or any other Fruits of the Air. Fogs are &s;o u&s;ual in this Country in <HI>November,</HI> that there was nothing par|ticular ob&s;erv'd about them that I know. But there was hardly any thing fell from the Clouds during the Month of <HI>November,</HI> except a very &s;mall Quanti|ty of Snow, attended with a Fro&s;t of
<PB N="195" REF="208">
no long Duration; and this was all the Winter we had. In the Northern Parts of <HI>France</HI> there was a very &s;mall Quan|tity of Snow, which la&s;ted from their 15th and our 4th of <HI>November,</HI> till af|ter <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> This was &s;ucceeded by Southerly Winds and &s;tinking Fogs, during which there was ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome Chirurgeons a great Di&s;po&s;ition in Wounds to mortify. Both before and during the Continuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> the Air was warm, beyond the u&s;ual Temper of the Sea&s;on, with great Quantities of &s;ulphureous Vapours, producing great Storms of Wind from the South-We&s;t, and &s;ometimes Lightning without Thunder.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. As to the Time of Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, they were different in dif|ferent Countries. It invaded <HI>Saxony</HI> and the neighbouring Countries in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> about the 15th of <HI>November,</HI> and la&s;ted in its Vigour till the 29th of the &s;ame Month. It was earlier in <HI>Holland</HI> than in <HI>England;</HI> earlier in <HI>E|dinburgh</HI> than in <HI>London.</HI> It was in <HI>New-England</HI> before it attack'd <HI>Bri|tain;</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> before it reach'd &s;ome other Places we&s;tward, as <HI>Oxford, Bath, &amp;c.</HI> and, as far as I can collect from Accounts, it invaded the Northerly Parts
<PB N="196" REF="209">
of <HI>Europe</HI> before the Southerly. It la&s;ted in its Vigour in <HI>London,</HI> from about the middle of <HI>January</HI> 173&frac23;, for about 3 Weeks; the Bill of Mortality, from <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 23d to <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> contain'd in all 1588, be|ing higher than any time &s;ince the Plague. It began in <HI>Paris</HI> about the beginning of their <HI>February,</HI> or the 21&s;t of our <HI>January,</HI> and la&s;ted till the be|ginning of their <HI>April,</HI> or the 21&s;t of our <HI>March;</HI> and I think its Duration was longe&s;t in the &s;outherly Countries. It raged in <HI>Naples</HI> and the &s;outhern Parts of <HI>Italy</HI> in our <HI>March.</HI> The Di&s;|ea&s;e, in travelling from Place to Place, did not ob&s;erve the Direction, but went often contrary to the Cour&s;e of the Winds.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The Uniformity of the Symp|toms of the Di&s;ea&s;e in every Place was mo&s;t remarkable. A &s;mall Rigor or Chilline&s;s, &s;ucceeded with a Fever of a Duration (in &s;uch as recover'd) &s;eldom above three Days. This Fever was at|tended with a Headach, &s;ometimes Pains in the Back, Thir&s;t in no great Degree, a Catarrh or thin Defluxion, occa&s;ion|ing Sneezing; a <HI>Coryza,</HI> or Running at the No&s;e; a Cough with Expectoration of a thin Pituite at fir&s;t, and afterwards
<PB N="197" REF="210">
of a vi&s;cous Matter; in which, if there was ob&s;erv'd a clear oily Matter, it prov'd generally the Ca&s;e to be mortal, for this clear Matter was purulent. The&s;e were the mo&s;t common Symp|toms: But a great many during that Sea&s;on were affected with Spitting of Blood, Pleuri&s;ies, and Inflammations of the Lungs, dangerous, and often mor|tal; in &s;ome Places, particularly in <HI>France,</HI> the Fever after &s;ix or &s;even Days ended in miliary Eruptions; in <HI>Holland</HI> often in Impo&s;thumations of the Throat; in all the Blood was &s;izy; and every where the Di&s;ea&s;e was parti|cularly fatal to aged People. What was ob&s;ervable was, that the Fever left a Debility and Dejection of Appetite and Spirits, much more than in Pro|portion to its Strength or Duration; and the Cough outla&s;ted the Fever in &s;ome more than &s;ix Weeks or two Months.</P>
<P N="15">XV. There was during the whole Sea&s;on, a great Run of Hy&s;terical, Hy|pochondriacal, and Nervous Di&s;tempers; in &s;hort, all the Symptoms of Relaxa|tion. The&s;e Symptoms were &s;o high in &s;ome as to produce a &s;ort of Fatui|ty or Madne&s;s, in which, for &s;ome Hours together, they would be &s;eiz'd with a wandering of their Sen&s;es, mi&s;|taking
<PB N="198" REF="211">
their common Affairs; at the &s;ame time they had not any great De|gree of a Fever to confine them to their Beds; but in &s;everal who were thus affected, the Urine was ob&s;erv'd of|ten to change from pale to turbid, al|ternately, &s;o that there was &s;ome Fever; tho' I did not ob&s;erve nor hear that the Bark was effectual, but the &s;aline Febrifuge Draughts had generally a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing good Effect. Since this Di&s;ea&s;e has been over, the Air has con|tinued to be particularly noxious in Di&s;ea&s;es which affect the Lungs, and for that Rea&s;on occa&s;ioning a great and unu&s;ual Mortality of the Meazles, at the Rate of 40 in a Week, from which one has rea&s;on to expect &s;ome &s;peciali|ties in the Di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ucceeding Sea&s;on.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Remedies commonly &s;uc|ce&s;sful in this epidemical catarrhous Fe|ver were Bleeding, Sweating, promoted by watery Diaphoreticks, Bli&s;ters, and the common pectoral Medicines; and what I ob&s;erv'd before, Febrifuge Draughts of Salt, of Wormwood, Juice of Limon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have not Particulars enough to enable me to enter into the Aetiology of this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="199" REF="212" MS="y">
XVII. It was Matter of Fact that there was a previous ill Con&s;titution of the Air, noxious to animal Bodies. In <HI>Autumn,</HI> and long afterwards, a Mad|ne&s;s among Dogs; the Hor&s;es were &s;eiz'd with the Catarrh before Mankind; and a Gentleman averr'd to me, that &s;ome Birds, particularly the Sparrows, left the Place where he was during the Sick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The previous great Drought, as has been ob&s;erv'd before, mu&s;t have been particularly hurtful to Mankind: Great Droughts exert their Effects af|ter the Surface of the Earth is again opened by Moi&s;ture; and the Per&s;pira|tion of the Ground, which was long &s;uppre&s;s'd, is &s;uddenly re&s;tor'd. It is probable that the Earth then emits &s;everal new Effluvia hurtful to Hu|man Bodies; that this appear'd to be the Ca&s;e by the thick and &s;tinking Fogs which pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeded the Rain that had fall'n before.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. It is likewi&s;e evident that the&s;e Effluvia were not of any particular or mineral Nature, becau&s;e they were of a Sub&s;tance that was common to every Part of the Surface of the Earth; and therefore one may conclude that they were watery Exhalations, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="213">
&s;uch mix'd with other exhalable Sub|&s;tances that are common to every Spot of Ground.</P>
<P N="20">XX. La&s;tly, It is agreeable to Expe|rience that watery Effluvia are hurtful to the Glands of the Windpipe and the Lungs, and productive of Catarrhs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. Of the Effects of natural Explo&s;ions of the Air upon Human Bodies.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. EXPLOSIONS of the Air by Lightning and Thunder, pro|duce more &s;udden and terrible Effects upon Human Bodies, than any other Alterations of the Air what&s;oever; therefore in a Hi&s;tory of the Effects of Air on Human Bodies, they ought not to be omitted; tho' there is little more to be &s;aid of them than that their Ef|fects re&s;emble tho&s;e of Gunpowder, and other artificial Explo&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">II. There may be imagin'd many na|tural Cau&s;es of tho&s;e violent Explo&s;ions of the Air: Salts and Sulphurs (of which there are great Quantities in the Air) mix'd and kindled, will produce

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Practical Aphori&s;ms relating to the Air, drawn from the Doctrine of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> And from other Writers of Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es; of which &s;ome are certain, others confirm'd by &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, and are &s;et down as Subjects of further Enquiry.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AIR is the Principle of Life, without which no Animal can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Moment.</P>
<P N="2">II. Good Air, as it is the chief In|&s;trument of Health, may ju&s;tly be rec|kon'd among&s;t the greate&s;t natural Ble&s;|&s;ings. We find by the Influence of good Air whole Nations are able to &s;upport the Want of many Comforts of Life with Chearfulne&s;s and Mirth; and the contrary is likewi&s;e true.</P>
<P N="3">III. Mankind, by Rea&s;on and their la|comotive Faculty, have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure the Power of defending them&s;elves from the Injuries of the Air; but few have the Choice of the Air in which they live.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Cu&s;tom enables human Creatures to &s;upport the Effects of Air, and ren|ders the Alterations produc'd in their
<PB N="206" REF="219">
Solids and Fluids familiar and le&s;s hurt|ful. By No VII. Chap. V. Animals by Cu&s;tom can better &s;upport the Air-pump: Therefore.</P>
<P N="5">V. Every Human Creature who&s;e manner of Life demands, and who&s;e Con&s;titution can bear it, ought to inure them&s;elves to the outward Air, in &s;everal &s;orts of Weather.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In the Choice of Habitations for Mankind, the Whol&s;omne&s;s of the Air is a principal Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Air is as much a Particular in the Purcha&s;e of a Seat, as the Soil.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Endemial Di&s;ea&s;es of tem|perate People are the Product of the Air; and the be&s;t Mark of the Whol&s;omne&s;s of the Air is the cu&s;tomary Longaevity of the Inhabitants, or the Rate of their Bills of Mortality.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The local Qualities of the Air, de|pend upon the Exhalations of the Soil, and tho&s;e of its Neighbourhood, which may be brought thither by Winds.</P>
<P N="10">X. A Soil, gravelly, chalky, &s;andy, has but a &s;mall Quantity of Per&s;piration, for it imbibes Moi&s;ture, and therefore is free from noxious Exhalations.</P>
<P N="11">XI. From a rich, fat, mar&s;hy Soil, a great Quantity and Variety of Vapours are rais'd by the Action of the Sun,
<PB N="207" REF="220">
and the Heat communicated to the Sur|face of the Earth; which mu&s;t at cer|tain Times and Sea&s;ons variou&s;ly affect the Inhabitants by its Contents, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Water, Oils, Salts, and &s;everal other Ingredients, of which the Analy&s;is of the Dew is the be&s;t Index; accord|ingly, rich Soils on the Banks of Riv|ers in hot Countries, are extremely un|healthy.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Mere watery Exhalations perhaps are not &s;o unwhol&s;om: Soils which a|bound with the&s;e, are &s;uch as retain Wa|ter, as Clay and level Grounds, where the Water &s;tagnates; and &s;pungy Grounds on the Tops of Hills, which attract Va|pours.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Qualities of the Springs are the Mark of tho&s;e of the Air, for both the Air and Water imbibe the &s;aline and mineral Exhalations of the Ground; therefore where the Water is &s;weet and good, it is probable the Air is &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Dampne&s;s of Wain&s;cot, rotting of Furniture, tarni&s;hing of Metals, ru&s;t|ing of Iron, Efflore&s;cence of Salts upon any Bodies, Di&s;colourations of Silks and Linen, are Marks of Salts of an unu&s;ual Nature or Quality in the Air. <HI>See</HI> Chap. IV. No VIII.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="208" REF="221">
XV. The Steams of dry Ground, with|out any of tho&s;e noxious Qualities, are naturally whol&s;om and refre&s;hing upon opening with a Spade or Plow.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. In choo&s;ing Situations, Regard ought to be had to the local Steams of the neighbouring Soil; a gravelly Situa|tion may be render'd &s;ickly by the Air of a neighbouring Mar&s;h, brought thither by Winds.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es, which proceed from noxious local Steams, af|fect Cities le&s;s than the Country; for in Cities there is le&s;s Per&s;piration from the Ground, and the Air is in &s;ome mea&s;ure artificial: On the contrary, in dry Fro&s;ts, when the Per&s;piration of the Ground is &s;topt, inflammatory epi|demical Di&s;ea&s;es affect the Citizens mo&s;t, being more lazy and luxurious. <HI>See</HI> Chap. VI.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The Air of Cities is not &s;o friendly to the Lungs as that of the Country, for it is replete with &s;ulphu|reous Steams of Fuel, and the per&s;pira|ble Matter of Animals; therefore the Con&s;umptive and A&s;thmatic are better in the Country.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The Air of Cities is unfriend|ly to Infants and Children. Every Ani|mal is adapted to the U&s;e of fre&s;h,
<PB N="209" REF="222">
natural, and free Air; the Tolerance of artificial Air (as that of Cities) is the Ef|fect of Habit, which young Animals have not yet acquir'd. The great Mor|tality of Children under two Years, in <HI>London,</HI> is not intirely owing to the &s;mall Care of the Brood of the Nece&s;&s;i|tous, and of Ba&s;tards.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The fir&s;t Care in building of Cities, is to make them airy and well perflated; infectious Di&s;tempers mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be propagated among&s;t Mankind living clo&s;e together.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Private Hou&s;es ought to be per|flated once a Day, by opening Doors and Windows, to blow off the Animal Steams.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. Hou&s;es, for the &s;ake of Warmth fenc'd from Wind, and where the Car|penters Work is &s;o nice as to exclude all outward Air, are not the mo&s;t whol|&s;om.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. People who pa&s;s mo&s;t of their Time in Air tainted with Steams of A|nimals, Fire, and Candles, are often af|fected with nervous Di&s;tempers. Living con&s;tantly in Air that kills Vegetables, cannot be whol&s;om for Animals.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Burial-Places ought to be with|out the Precincts of great Cities.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="210" REF="223">
XXV. The Country Air in Spring and Summer has a con&s;iderable Influence up|on Mankind by the Steams of Vegeta|bles, which variou&s;ly &s;timulate, and per|haps exhilerate the Spirits; and upon the &s;ame Account the Air of a planted and inclos'd Country is different from that of an open, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es le&s;s re|fre&s;hing.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. In great Latitudes, where the Difference of Heat and Cold are great, the Diet and Cloathing of the Inhabi|tants ought to vary with the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The Qualities of Winter Air, as the Weight, Den&s;ity, Coldne&s;s, Dry|ne&s;s of Air in fro&s;ty Weather, are &s;uch as induce a Stricture of the Fibres, and the Di&s;tempers are analogous: Therefore the Diet ought to be re|laxing, &s;uch are the U&s;e of tepid, wa|tery Liquors, and Bathing.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The copious U&s;e of &s;piri|tuous Liquors is more hurtful in the Winter, and Evacuation better tolerated, not only by the greater Stricture of Fi|bres, but by rea&s;on of a more copious Aliment.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. Cold, in mo&s;t People, increa&s;|eth the Appetite: It is remarkable in the Hi&s;tory of &s;uch as peri&s;h'd by Cold
<PB N="211" REF="224">
in Northern Countries, that they kept their Appetite to the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Exerci&s;e in the Winter is more ea&s;ily tolerated; nece&s;&s;ary for promoting Per&s;piration, as the mo&s;t durable and be&s;t Defence again&s;t outward Cold, and like|wi&s;e for the Dige&s;tion of a more gro&s;s and copious Aliment.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. In Winter the Aliment, as well as the Weather, contribute to produce the Scurvy; to correct which, the U&s;e of Vegetables, as far as they can be &s;upply'd, is nece&s;&s;ary in the Winter, and a Diet almo&s;t vegetable in the Spring; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e then bilious Di&s;|tempers begin to rage.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Defences again&s;t intolerable Extremities of Heat, as Re&s;t, Shade, Venilation, Grottos, or Souterrains, are as nece&s;&s;ary Pre&s;ervatives of Health, as tho&s;e again&s;t extreme Cold.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. Air approaching to Animal Heat, or 90 Degrees, is dangerous, and the Effects of it more &s;udden than of Cold: Heat exceeding 90 Degrees coa|gulates the White of an Egg: Hot Wea|ther, of long Duration, mu&s;t produce great Alterations in Human Bodies.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. The Heat of our Summer is &s;eldom exce&s;&s;ive or durable, and con|&s;equently
<PB N="212" REF="225">
not unhealthy: During the Summer in our Climate, many chroni|cal Di&s;tempers, and the acute ones of the Spring are &s;ilent.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. The Di&s;ea&s;es of our Sum|mers are mo&s;t commonly the Effects of &s;udden Alternations of Heat and Cold.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. The mo&s;t &s;udden and dan|gerous Effects of Heat are from In&s;ola|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Sun-beams.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. The Heat of Air ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> manag'd, as not to produce too great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which thicken the Fluids and relax the Solids.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Too great and &s;udden Refrigeration by Ventilation, may be dan|gerous</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. Feveri&s;h Heat may be aba|ted by cool Air. The Management of the Air in the Patient's Room is a nece&s;|&s;ary and important Piece of the Regi|men in acute Di&s;tempers. The too great Heat and Dryne&s;s, and other bad Qua|lities of the Air, have been often &s;ucce&s;s|fully tempered by the Steams of &s;ome Vegetables in a Patient's Room; e&s;peci|ally of &s;ome of the &s;oporiferous Kind, as Henbane, Cow&s;lips, Poppies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="40"><PB N="213" REF="226">
XL. Great Colds &s;ucceeding great Heats, are productive of Di&s;ea&s;es; even cold Nights, after hot Days. Many of the acute Di&s;ea&s;es of <HI>Europeans</HI> in hot Countries, are occa&s;ion'd by their expo|&s;ing them&s;elves incautiou&s;ly to the &s;erene or nightly Dew.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. From the Effects of different Qualities of the Air, it is ea&s;y to deter|mine what Air is fit or unfit for what Con&s;titutions. A moi&s;t Air relaxeth, therefore unfit for &s;uch as have weak Fibres or are phlegmatick and bloated: A dry cold Air, with the Barometer high, contracts the Fibres, therefore apt to throw &s;uch as have a &s;trict Con&s;titution into inflammatory Di&s;tempers: A dry hot Air is unfit for the Lean, Scraggy, and Atrabilarious, and fit for &s;uch as are of a contrary Con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. The be&s;t Indications for the Choice of Air are taken from the Con&s;ti|tution of the Patient, and the popular Di&s;ea&s;es of the Inhabitants. The Air of <HI>France</HI> fit for Hypochondriacal and Sto|machicks: The Air of <HI>Holland,</HI> where Coughs are not frequent has been found better for &s;ome &s;orts of Pulmonicks than that of warmer Countries: The Air of Countries which by Heat often di&s;po&s;eth
<PB N="214" REF="227">
to Spittings of Blood, promotes too great Sweating, and con&s;umes the mu&s;cular Fle&s;h, can never be good for &s;ome &s;orts of Con&s;umptions.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. The Scurvy of Seafaring Peo|ple is not merely the Effect of Salt Provi|&s;ions, but likewi&s;e of Moi&s;ture.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. Great Alterations are produc'd in Human Bodies by great Enormities of the Sea&s;ons, and by &s;udden Altera|tions of the Weather from one Extreme to another, by Change of Situation into Air of contrary Qualities, as an Inhabi|tant of a cold Climate going into a hot one; by &s;uch Changes the Solids and Flu|ids are agitated, and the Motions being uncu&s;tomary, &s;timulate more.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. Air exceeding the natural Heat of the Body, cannot be long endured with Safety, e&s;pecially if the Humours are in an inflammatory State. I have known two In&s;tances of malignant Fevers produc'd by the hot Air of a Bagnio.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. The Diet of the Inhabitants ought to vary with the Sea&s;on and Cli|mate; perhaps in a cold moi&s;t Air a great|er Indulgence in &s;pirituous Liquors is al|lowable.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. In Sea&s;ons, Climates, and Countries extremely hot, Cordials of
<PB N="215" REF="228">
&s;ome &s;ort are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as Wine and Spices.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. The Di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from a cold and moi&s;t Air indicate Diapho|reticks.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. The Complexion of the Inha|bitants being clear and vivid, is a Sign of a whol&s;om Air; and contrariwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="50">L. The Lungs of young People in the Prime of their Age are hot and tender, and being in immediate Con|tact with the outward Air, may be va|riou&s;ly affected with its Contents and Qualities: Therefore the Choice of Air is of great Importance to Pulmonicks in tho&s;e of a more advanc'd Age. The Lungs are le&s;s hot, and more coreaceous or tough.</P>
<P N="51">LI. The Mark of tender Fibres, even of the Lungs, is a vivid &s;anguine Com|plexion: Tran&s;parency of the Skin is a Sign of Slenderne&s;s and Delicacy of its Fibres.</P>
<P N="52">LII. Young Pulmonicks are &s;ubject to Con&s;umptions, and the old to A&s;thmas.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. Air charg'd with &s;ulphureous Steams, &s;uch as that of Cities, is noxi|ous to A&s;thmaticks; not only by the Dan|ger of Suffocation, but by the chronical Di&s;tempers induc'd by an imperfect Re|&s;piration;
<PB N="216" REF="229">
for when the Re&s;piration is im|perfect the Sanguification is &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. Experience is the be&s;t Guide in the Choice of Air, or the Freedom of the Inhabitants from the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Pa|tient.</P>
<P N="55">LV. A good Dige&s;tion depends upon Per&s;piration and a good Sanguification, and that upon a good Re&s;piration; there|fore the Choice of Air is of great Impor|tance to Stomachicks; a cold moi&s;t Air renders both the Per&s;piration and Re&s;pi|ration imperfect.</P>
<P N="56">LVI. The Earth may be con&s;ider'd as a compound Body, under Dige&s;tion by Heat, by the different Degrees of which Heat there may be rais'd Effluvia of &s;e|veral &s;orts, &s;ucceeding one another; and epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es may be the Product of the&s;e Effluvia: Accordingly we find the Spring and Autumn to be Sea&s;ons of epi|demical Di&s;ea&s;es: The Alterations of Heat are the greate&s;t before and after the Equinox, for then the Declination of the Sun changeth the fa&s;te&s;t.</P>
<P N="57">LVII. Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es, with all the Specialities of their Character, de|pend upon the Con&s;titution of the Air previous and pre&s;ent: A healthy Per&s;on, without any Error in the Non-natural, is
<PB N="217" REF="230">
often &s;eiz'd &s;oon after his Arrival with the epidemical Di&s;ea&s;e of that Place.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII. The Methods &s;ucce&s;sful in the Cure of epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es of one Sea&s;on, are often hurtful in tho&s;e of another; this Diver&s;ity proceeds from the Tempe|rature of the Air, which is nece&s;&s;ary not only to be ob&s;erv'd, but to be recorded.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. Great Heat and Cold &s;ucceeding one another, occa&s;ion Pleuri&s;ies and Quin|zies.</P>
<P N="60">LX. Vernal and autumnal Di&s;ea&s;es, like Vegetables, come &s;ooner or later, as the Weather favours them. <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> in the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Autumn, takes notice of the nocturnal Acce&s;&s;ions; in that Sea&s;on the Nights grow cooler and longer after hot Days.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. <HI>Cholera Morbus</HI> is commonly con|fin'd to <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the Bile is mo&s;t ex|alted by great Heats, a &s;trong Per&s;piration of the Day, and perhaps Abatement of it at Night; likewi&s;e by the too copious U&s;e of cold Fruits.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. The dangerous Symptoms of dif|ferent &s;orts of acute Di&s;tempers of the &s;ame Sea&s;on, depend upon the Con&s;titu|tion of the Air, and by rea&s;on of that univer&s;al Cau&s;e, the Methods &s;ucce&s;sful in one, &s;eem to be indicated in the other.</P>
<P N="63"><PB N="218" REF="231">
LXIII. The epidemical Di&s;ea&s;e, that is, the Ma&s;ter-Di&s;ea&s;e of the Sea&s;on, im|parts its Genius to the other Di&s;ea&s;es; as malignant Small-pox, and a malignant Fever without the Small-pox. The Fe|ver preceeding, accompanying, and &s;uc|ceeding the Plague was the &s;ame. Dr. <HI>Sy|denham,</HI> from whom the&s;e &s;ix la&s;t Apho|ri&s;ms are deduc'd, confirms this Ob&s;er|vation by &s;everal In&s;tances: Therefore, according to the Opinion of the &s;ame &s;a|gacious Per&s;on,</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. It may be u&s;eful to Phy&s;ick to give general Signatures and Names to Di&s;|ea&s;es from the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. There may be taken proper and u&s;eful Indications, both Pre&s;ervative and Curative, from the Qualities of the Air: What produceth Relaxation and Fluxili|ty &s;eems to be indicated in Cold; Dia|phoreticks in moi&s;t; cooling, acid, &s;typ|tick Remedies, in hot and dry Air.</P>
<P N="66">LXVI. No artificial Defences, as by keeping within Doors, are effectual a|gain&s;t a general Contagion of the Air; this was evident in the late epidemical Catarrh Fever: Yet &s;uch Defences may abate &s;omething of the Effect.</P>
<P N="69"><PB N="219" REF="232">
LXIX. Moi&s;ture that opens the Sur|face of the Earth, &s;ucceeding great Droughts which &s;hut it, produceth a &s;ickly Con&s;titution of the Sea&s;on; &s;uch are Thaws after long Fro&s;ts, Rains after great Droughts.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. Infants, by their pliant and ten|der Fibres, are more &s;en&s;ible of the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Air than Adults; but as they mu&s;t afterwards endure them, they ought to be made hardy by all &s;afe Means; &s;uch as have been inur'd to the Injuries of the outward Air, and accu&s;tom'd to a great Simplicity of Diet, are no more &s;en&s;ible of the Injuries of outward Air, than the Cattle.

<P><HI>What follows is deduc'd from the Epidemical Hi&s;tory of</HI> Germany.</P>

<P N="73">LXXIII. The Weather, and the epi|demical Di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame Climate, re|&s;emble one another; the epidemical Hi&s;|tory of <HI>Germany</HI> fits <HI>Britain.</HI></P>

LXXXI. From an unu&s;ual Incon&s;tan|cy of the Weather, and perpetual Changes of the Wind from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, epide|mical Dy&s;enteries.</P>
<P N="82">LXXXII. From Extremity of Heat in the Dog-days, a rainy Sea&s;on, a malig|nant Spotted Fever.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. From Fro&s;t and Snow in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> an extremely mortal Small-pox and Dy&s;entery in Autumn.</P>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. From rainy Sea&s;ons, Head-aches, Toothaches, Rheumati&s;ms, A&s;th|mas.</P>
<P N="85">LXXXV. From great Enormities of the Sea&s;ons a great Run of epidemical Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. From frequent, great, and &s;udden Changes of the Weather, acute Di&s;tempers with dangerous Symptoms.</P>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. In orderly Sea&s;ons the common popular Di&s;ea&s;es neither rife nor mortal.</P>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. From hoar Fro&s;ts in the Morning, &s;ucceeded by hot Days in the Summer, an unu&s;ual Run of dangerous intermitting Fevers and Jaundices. Ac|cording to that of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> from Heat and Cold in the &s;ame Day, expect Au|tumnal Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="89"><PB N="222" REF="235">
LXXXIX. The &s;ickly Con&s;titution at|tending Thaws is mended by Winds blow|ing off the Vapours.</P>
<P N="90">XC. From extreme and la&s;ting Cold, a great Run of Apoplexies and other con|generous Di&s;ea&s;es, Catarrhs, Vertigoes.</P>
<P N="91">XCI. From great Heat and Drought, burning continued Fevers, attended with Haemorrages, bilious Vomitings, and De|jections.</P>
<P N="92">XCII. In Mildews which corrupt Ve|getables, the Morning and Evening Air dangerous. Northerly and Ea&s;terly Winds, which &s;top the Per&s;piration of Vegetables (abating their Fragrancy) have probably the &s;ame Effect upon Mankind.</P>
<P N="93">XCIII. Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es depend not only on the pre&s;ent, but the previous Con|&s;titution both of the Air and Patient: A hot Sea&s;on often produceth the Scurvy and other cutaneous Irruptions; after pre|vious Cold there have been Scurvies, which were exa&s;perated by Heat, as that in the Memoirs of the <HI>Academy de Sci|ences.</HI></P>
<P N="94">XCIV. Weather which produceth no unea&s;y Sen&s;ation in Human Bodies, is whol&s;om as long as it la&s;ts; but the Indo|lence produc'd by &s;uch Weather may make them more &s;en&s;ible of the Agita|tions,
<PB N="223" REF="236">
both of their Fluids and Solids by the Change.</P>
<P N="95">XCV. The epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es of Ani|mals much expos'd to the Air, and who&s;e Diet is &s;imple, depend upon the Con&s;ti|tution of the Sea&s;on. The Difference of the Quality of the Fruits of the Ground operate likewi&s;e, but not &s;o much as the Air.</P>
<P N="96">XCVI. Journals of the Weather, Reign|ing Di&s;ea&s;es, and Remedies &s;ucce&s;sful, would be of great U&s;e to Mankind, and more e&s;pecially to Phy&s;icians: From &s;uch Journals perhaps it might be po&s;&s;ible to predict both the Weather and the epide|mical Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="97">XCVII. In judging of the Con&s;titution of the Air, many things be&s;ides the Wea|ther ought to be ob&s;erv'd: The Di&s;ea&s;es of Vegetables and Brutes; in &s;ome Coun|tries, the Silence of Gra&s;hoppers; Want of Mellification in Bees; De&s;ertion of Birds; Quantities of In&s;ects; &s;ulphureous Vapours; Mortality of Di&s;ea&s;es common|ly not dangerous; &s;uch things have been ob&s;erv'd to be &s;ignificant.</P>
<P N="98">XCVIII. In Cities infected with the Plague, the mo&s;t effectual Care of the Police is an early and quick Separation of the infected Hou&s;es, Streets, Quarters
<PB N="224" REF="237">
of the City from the uninfected, with proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Sick, and a Re|moval of the other Inhabitants into &s;ome airy and well perflated Incampment, in Tents or Barracks.</P>
<P N="99">XCIX. By good Government many of the Infected may be &s;av'd, and many Sound pre&s;erved from the Infection. In the Hi&s;tory of the Plague of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> one may &s;ee the bad Effects of Confu&s;ion and Neglect in the Beginning, and the good Effects of Order towards the End.</P>
