<SP>
<L>FAR from the haunts of men, of vice the foe,</L>
<L>The moon-&s;truck child of genius and of woe,</L>
<L>Ver&s;ed in each magic &s;pell, and dear to fame,</L>
<L>A fair enchantre&s;s dwells, Romance her name.</L>
<L>She loathes the &s;un, or blazing taper's light:</L>
<L>The moon-beam'd land&s;cape and tempe&s;tuous night</L>
<L>Alone &s;he loves; and oft, with glimmering lamp,</L>
<L>Near graves new-open'd, or 'mid&s;t dungeons damp,</L>
<L>Drear fore&s;ts, ruin'd ai&s;les, and haunted towers,</L>
<L>Forlorn &s;he roves, and raves away the hours!</L>
<L>Anon, when &s;torms howl loud and la&s;h the deep,</L>
<L>De&s;perate &s;he climbs the &s;ea-rock's beetling &s;teep;</L>
<L>There wildly &s;trikes her harp's fanta&s;tic &s;trings,</L>
<L>Tells to the moon how grief her bo&s;om wrings,</L>
<L>And while her &s;trange &s;ong chaunts fictitious ills,</L>
<L>In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm di&s;tills.</L>
<L>A youth, who yet has lived enough to know</L>
<L>That life has thorns, and ta&s;te the cup of woe,</L>
<L>As late near Conway's time-bowed towers he &s;tray'd,</L>
<L>Invok'd this bright enthu&s;ia&s;ts magic aid.</L>
<L>His prayer was heard. With arms and bo&s;om bare,</L>
<L>Eyes fla&s;hing fire, loo&s;e robes, and &s;treaming hair,</L>
<L>Her heart all angui&s;h, and her &s;oul all flame,</L>
<L>Swift as her thoughts, the lovely maniac came!</L>
<L>High heav'd her brea&s;ts, which &s;truggling pa&s;&s;ions rent,</L>
<L>As pre&s;t to give &s;ome fear-fraught my&s;tery vent:</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="3">And oft, with anxious glance and alter'd face,</L>
<L>Trembling with terror, &s;he relaxed her pace,</L>
<L>And &s;topt! and li&s;tened!&mdash;Then with hurried tread</L>
<L>Onwards again &s;he ru&s;h'd, yet backwards bent her head,</L>
<L>As if from murderous &s;words or following fiends &s;he fled!</L>
<L>Soon as near Conway's walls her foot&s;teps drew,</L>
<L>She bade the youth their ancient &s;tate renew:</L>
<L>Eager he &s;ped the fallen towers to rear:</L>
<L>'Twas done, and fancy bore the fabric here.</L>
<L>Next choo&s;ing from great Shak&s;peare's comic &s;chool,</L>
<L>The go&s;&s;ip crone, gro&s;s friar, and gibing fool&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e, with a virgin fair and lover brave,</L>
<L>To our young author's care the enchantre&s;s gave;</L>
<L>But charged him, ere he ble&s;s'd the brave and fair,</L>
<L>To lay th' exulting villain's bo&s;om bare,</L>
<L>And by the torments of his con&s;cience &s;how,</L>
<L>That pro&s;perous vice is but triumphant woe!</L>
<L>The plea&s;ing ta&s;k, congenial to his &s;oul,</L>
<L>Oft from his own &s;ad thoughts our author &s;tole:</L>
<L>Ble&s;t be his labours, if with like &s;ucce&s;s</L>
<L>They &s;oothe their &s;orrows whom I now addre&s;s.</L>
<L>Beneath this dome, &s;hould &s;ome afflicted brea&s;t</L>
<L>Mourn &s;lighted talents, or de&s;ert oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>Fal&s;e friend&s;hip, hopele&s;s love, or faith betray'd;</L>
<L>Our author will e&s;teem each toil o'er-paid,</L>
<L>If, while his mu&s;e exerts her livelier vein,</L>
<L>Or tells imagined woes in plaintive &s;train,</L>
<L>Her flights and fancies make one &s;mile appear</L>
<L>On the pale cheek, where trickled late a tear;</L>
<L>Or if <HI>her</HI> fabled &s;orrows &s;teal one groan,</L>
<L>Which el&s;e her hearers would have given their own.</L>

<L>OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry,</L>
<L>My honour &s;aved, and dad alive and merry,</L>
<L>Hither I come the public doom to know,</L>
<L>But come not uncompell'd&mdash;the more's my woe!</L>
<L>E'en now, (oh! pity, friends, my hard mi&s;hap!)</L>
<L>My &s;houlder felt a Bow-Street runner's tap,</L>
<L>Who, while I &s;hook with fear in every limb,</L>
<L>Thus &s;poke, with accent &s;tern and vi&s;age grim&mdash;</L>
<L>"Mi&s;tre&s;s!" quoth he, "to me it given in tru&s;t is,</L>

<L>Finding that all I &s;aid was &s;aid in vain,</L>
<L>And Town&s;hend &s;till his fir&s;t de&s;ign maintain,</L>
<L>I thought 'twere be&s;t to fly for &s;helter here,</L>
<L>And beg my generous friends to interfere.</L>
<L>But though the awkward nature of my ca&s;e</L>
<L>May &s;pread &s;ome &s;light confu&s;ion o'er my face,</L>
<L>No terrors awe my bo&s;om, I'll a&s;&s;ure ye;</L>

<L>And all perforce, his crimes when I relate,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t own that O&s;mond well de&s;erved his fate.</L>
<L>He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading;</L>
<L>He &s;tabbed mama&mdash;which was extreme ill-breeding;</L>
<L>And at his feet for mercy when <HI>I</HI> &s;ued,</L>
<L>The odious wretch, I vow, was downright rude.</L>
<L>Twice his bold hands my per&s;on dared to touch!</L>
<L>Twice in one day!&mdash;'Twas really once too much!</L>
<L>And therefore ju&s;tly filled with virtuous ire,</L>
<L>To &s;ave my honour, and protect my fire,</L>
<L>I drew my knife, and in his bo&s;om &s;tuck it;</L>
<L>He fell, you clapped&mdash;and then he kicked the bucket!</L>
<L>So peri&s;h &s;till the wretch, who&s;e &s;oul can know</L>
<L>Selfi&s;h delight, while cau&s;ing other's woe;</L>
<L>Who bla&s;ts that joy, the &s;weete&s;t God has given,</L>
<L>And makes an hell, where love would make an heaven!</L>
<L>Forbear, thou lawle&s;s libertine! nor &s;eek</L>
<L>Forc'd favours on that pale averted cheek:</L>
<L>If thy warm ki&s;&s;es co&s;t bright eyes one tear,</L>
<L>Ki&s;&s;es from lovelie&s;t lips are bought too dear&mdash;</L>
<L>Unle&s;s tho&s;e lips with thine keep playful mea&s;ure,</L>

<L>Now as for O&s;mond&mdash;at that villain's name</L>
<L>I feel reviving wrath my &s;oul inflame!</L>
<L>And &s;hall one &s;hort and &s;udden pang &s;uffice</L>

<L>No! To your bar, dear friends, for aid I fly!</L>
<L>Bid O&s;mond live again, again to die;</L>
<L>Nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall,</L>
<L>Nightly beneath my dagger &s;ee him fall,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>NEVER tell me!&mdash;I repeat it, you are a fellow of a very &s;candalous cour&s;e of life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I repeat it, I'm a perfect image of the pure&s;t virtue, compared to whom, for &s;obriety and continence, Cato was a drunkard, and Lucretia little better than &s;he &s;hould be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! hardened in impudence!&mdash;Can you deny being a pilferer, a lyar, a glutton&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I?&mdash;Heaven be thanked, I've courage enough to deny any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doesn't all the world cry out upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my tran&s;cendant merit has procured me &s;ome enemies, and, in common with many other great men, my virtue at pre&s;ent labours under &s;omething of a cloud. But under&s;tand me right, Father: Though I don't a&s;&s;ent to the &s;um-total
<PB N="2" REF="8">
of your accu&s;ations, po&s;&s;ibly I may acknow|ledge &s;ome of the items; the be&s;t actions frequently appear culpable, merely becau&s;e their motives are unexplained. Therefore produce your charges, let me ju&s;tify my conduct, and I doubt not I &s;hall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immacu|late and pure as a new &s;heet of fool&s;cap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To begin then with your pilfering&mdash; Did you, or did you not, break open the pantry-door, and &s;teal out the great goo&s;e-pye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who&s;e then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook's undoubtedly; for if he hadn't locked the pantry-door, 'tis an hundred to one I &s;houldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Non&s;en&s;e! Non&s;en&s;e!&mdash;I tell you, you've been guilty of &s;tealing, which is a mon&s;trous crime! And what did you &s;teal? Had you taken any thing el&s;e I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goo&s;e-pye!&mdash;As I'm a Chri&s;tian, the identical goo&s;e-pye which I in|tended for my own &s;upper!&mdash;But this is not my only objection to your conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What principally offends me is, that you pervert the minds of the maids, and keep ki&s;&s;|ing and &s;muggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh! fye! fye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ki&s;s and &s;muggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, 'tis they who ki&s;s and &s;muggle me. I prote&s;t I do what I can to pre&s;erve my mode&s;ty; and I wi&s;h that Archbi&s;hop Dun&s;tan had heard the lecture upon cha&s;tity which I read la&s;t night to the dairy-maid in the dark!
<PB N="3" REF="9">
he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking &s;ignify? The eloquence of my lips is coun|teracted by the lu&s;tre of my eyes; and really the little devils are &s;o tender, and &s;o trouble&s;ome, that I'm half angry with nature for having made me &s;o very bewitching.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Non&s;en&s;e! Non&s;en&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was but ye&s;terday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs, quarrelling which looked neate&s;t&mdash;my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are &s;o fond and &s;o coaxing! They hang about one &s;o lovingly! And one &s;ays, "Kind Mr. Mot|ley!" and t' other, "Sweet Mr. Motley!"&mdash;Ah! Father Philip! Father Philip! How is a poor little bit of fle&s;h and blood, like me, to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temp|tation?&mdash;Put your&s;elf in my place: Suppo&s;e that a &s;weet &s;miling rogue, ju&s;t &s;ixteen, with ro&s;y cheeks, &s;parkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fye! fye! fye!&mdash;To hear &s;uch licentious di&s;cour&s;e brings the tears into my eyes!</P>

<P>I believe you, Father; for I &s;ee the wa|ter is running over at your mouth. However, this &s;hews you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;hews me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown away upon you: In future I &s;hall keep tho&s;e coun&s;els to my&s;elf, which I offered you from motives of pure Chri&s;tian cha|rity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity, my good Father, &s;hould always begin at home: Now, in&s;tead of giving your&s;elf &s;o much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of correcting your&s;elf?</P>

I prote&s;t I'm grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Bea&s;ts who accompanied Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they mu&s;t infallibly have created a fa|mine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled.&mdash;Next, for incontinence, you mu&s;t al|low your&s;elf that you are unequalled.</P>

<P>Well, well, fool, I am going: but fir&s;t let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite.

You were then &s;carce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your child|hood.

But, as &s;he returned with her hu&s;band, robbers &s;urpri&s;ed the party &s;carce a mile from the Ca&s;tle; and &s;ince that time no news has been received of the Earl, of the Counte&s;s, the &s;ervants, or the child.</P>

<P>Willingly.

He is &s;uppo&s;ed to be dre&s;t in compleat armour; and that which you wear at pre&s;ent was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a confe|rence with Lady Angela; even now I heard her &s;ummoned to attend him in the Armoury. Placed upon this pede&s;tal you may li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e unob&s;erved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your mi&s;tre&s;s and her guardian.

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>MANY erroneous a&s;&s;ertions have been made re&s;pecting this Drama; &s;ome, that the language was originally extremely licentious; others, that the &s;entiments were violently demo|cratic; and others again, that if Mr. Sheridan had not advi&s;ed me to content my&s;elf with a &s;ingle Spectre, I meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of Gho&s;ts. To di&s;prove the&s;e re|ports I have deviated from the u&s;ual mode of publi&s;hing Plays, as performed, and have printed mine almo&s;t verbatim, as originally written. Whether it merited the above accu&s;ations, the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for him&s;elf. I mu&s;t ju&s;t mention that the la&s;t line of the Piece is altered, and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth Act, <HI>The Friar</HI> was made to &s;tick in the door-way, whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty.</P>
<P>Other charges, however, have been brought again&s;t me on better grounds, and I mu&s;t reque&s;t the reader's patience while I &s;ay a few words re&s;pecting them. To originality of cha|racter I make no pretence. Per&s;ecuted heroines and con|&s;cience-&s;tung villains certainly have made their courte&s;ies and bows to a Briti&s;h audience long before the appearance of <HI>"The Ca&s;tle Spectre;"</HI> the <HI>Friar</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> are copies, but very faint ones, from <HI>Juliet's Nur&s;e,</HI> and Sheridan's <HI>Father Paul,</HI> and <HI>Percy</HI> is a mighty pretty-behaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all. I &s;hall not &s;o readily give up my claim to novelty, when I mention my mi&s;anthropic <HI>Negro:</HI> He has been compared to <HI>Zanga;</HI> but Young's Hero differs widely from what I meant in <HI>Ha&s;&s;an. Zanga</HI>'s hatred is con|fined to one object; to de&s;troy the happine&s;s of that object is
<PB N="101" REF="107">
his &s;ole aim, and his vengeance is no &s;ooner accompli&s;hed, than he repents its gratification. <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> is a man of violent pa&s;&s;ions, and warm feelings, who&s;e bo&s;om is filled with the milk of human kindne&s;s, but that milk is &s;oured by de&s;pair; who&s;e nature was &s;u&s;ceptible of the tendere&s;t affections, but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever. He has lo&s;t every thing, even hope; he has no &s;ingle object again&s;t which he can direct his vengeance, and he di|rects it at large again&s;t mankind. He hates all the world, hates even him&s;elf; for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him.</P>
<Q><L>Lor&s;que l'on peut &s;ouffrir, &s;ure que &s;es douleurs</L>
<L>D'aucun mortel ne font jamais couler les pleurs,</L>
<L>On &s;e de&s;intere&s;&s;e &agrave; la fin de &s;oi-m&ecirc;me;</L>
<L>On ce&s;&s;e de s'aimer, &s;i quelqu'un ne nous aime!</L></Q>
<P>But though Ha&s;&s;an's heart is changed by di&s;appointment and misfortune, that heart once was feeling and kind; nor could he hate with &s;uch inveteracy, if he had not loved with extreme affection. In my opinion this character is not <HI>Zanga's;</HI> but this I mu&s;t leave to the public deci&s;ion. I may, however, boldly, and without vanity, a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>Motley</HI> is quite new to the Stage. In other plays the Fool has always been a &s;harp knave, quick in repartee, and full of whim, fancy, and entertainment; whereas <HI>my</HI> Fool (but I own I did not mean to make him &s;o) is a dull, flat, good &s;ort of plain matter of fact fellow, as in the cour&s;e of the per|formance Mr. Banni&s;ter di&s;covered to his great &s;orrow.</P>
<P>That <HI>O&s;mond</HI> is attended by <HI>negroes</HI> is an anachroni&s;m, I allow; but from the great applau&s;e which Mr. Dowton con|&s;tantly received in <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> (a character which he played ex|tremely well), I am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety. For my own part, I by no means repent the introduction of my <HI>Africans:</HI> I
<PB N="102" REF="108">
thought it would give a plea&s;ing variety to the characters and dre&s;&s;es, if I made my &s;ervants black; and could I have pro|duced the &s;ame effect by making my heroine blue, blue I &s;hould have made her.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Friar</HI>'s defence, when he mo&s;t ungallantly leaves <HI>An|gela</HI> in the cavern to &s;hift for her&s;elf, I can only plead the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. Stay where he was he could not; go he mu&s;t at any rate: I trundled him off in the be&s;t way that I could; and, for the &s;ake of the public, I heartily wi&s;h that way had been better. With regard to his not meeting <HI>O&s;mond</HI> in his flight, a little imagination will &s;oon conquer that diffi|culty: It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that as he lo&s;t his way in coming, he lo&s;t it again in going; or, that he concealed him&s;elf till <HI>the Earl</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed him; or, that he tumbled down and broke his neck; or, that he....did any thing el&s;e you like better. I leave this matter entirely to the reader's fancy.</P>
<P>Again&s;t my <HI>Spectre</HI> many objections have been urged: one of them I think rather curious. She ought not to appear, becau&s;e the belief in Gho&s;ts no longer exi&s;ts! In my opinion, this is the very rea&s;on why &s;he <HI>may</HI> be produced without dan|ger; for there is now no fear of increa&s;ing the influence of &s;u|per&s;tition, or &s;trengthening the prejudices of the weak-minded. I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to &s;talk in a tragedy, as Fairies be &s;uffered to fly in a pantomime, or Heathen Gods and Godde&s;&s;es to cut capers in a grand ballet; and I &s;hould rather imagine that <HI>Oberon</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> now find as little credit to the full as the <HI>Cock-lane Gho&s;t,</HI> or the Spectre of <HI>Mrs. Veal.</HI></P>
<P>Never was any poor &s;oul &s;o ill-u&s;ed as <HI>Evelina</HI>'s, previous to her pre&s;enting her&s;elf before the audience. The Friends to whom I read my Drama, the Managers to whom I pre&s;ented it, the Actors who were to perform in it&mdash;all combined to per|&s;ecute my <HI>Spectre,</HI> and reque&s;ted me to confine my Gho&s;t to
<PB N="103" REF="109">
the Green-Room. Aware that without her my cata&s;trophe would clo&s;ely re&s;emble that of the <HI>Grecian Daughter,</HI> I per|&s;i&s;ted in retaining her. The event ju&s;tified my ob&s;tinacy: <HI>The Spectre</HI> was as well treated before the curtain as &s;he had been ill-u&s;ed behind it; and as &s;he continues to make her ap|pearance nightly with increa&s;ed applau&s;e, I think my&s;elf un|der great obligations both to her and her repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>But though I am con&s;cious that it is very imperfect, I &s;hall not &s;o far offend my own feelings, or in&s;ult the judgment of the public, which has given it a very favourable reception, as to &s;ay that I think my Play very bad. Had &s;uch been my opinion, in&s;tead of producing it on the &s;tage, or committing it to the pre&s;s, I &s;hould have put it behind the fire, or, throwing it into the <HI>Thames,</HI> made a pre&s;ent of it to the Briti&s;h <HI>Scombri.</HI> Still its &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage (great enough to content even an author) does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the clo&s;et, when dive&s;ted of its beautiful mu&s;ic, &s;plendid &s;cenery, and, above all, of the acting, excellent throughout. Without detracting from the merits of the other performers (to all of whom I think my&s;elf much in|debted for their re&s;pective exertions), I mu&s;t here be per|mitted to return particular thanks to Mrs. Jordan, who&s;e manner of &s;u&s;taining her character exceeded my mo&s;t &s;an|guine hopes, and in who&s;e hands my heroine acquired an im|portance for which &s;he was entirely indebted to the talents of the actre&s;s.</P>
