<P>THE two Volumes we now offer to the Public contain what was compri&s;ed in the former edition of three Volumes.&mdash;The ad|ditional lines and alterations will be noticed in their proper place.

<PB N="iv" REF="3">a&s;&s;ert, that the Mite is no counter&s;eit coin; that it is not deba&s;ed by an admixture of any improper alloy; and that it came from the Poetic Mint impre&s;&s;ed with the Image of Nature.</P>

<P>THE MAGDALEN Charity was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the year 1758. A commodious habitation was engaged, in PRESCOT STREET, by the promoters of this be|nevolent in&s;titution, and the hou&s;e was opened on the tenth of Augu&s;t, when eight unhappy objects were admitted.</P>
<P>In the year 1772, the Charity was removed to a more &s;pacious building in ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS.</P>

<P>CHRISTIERN the Second, king of Denmark, offered to appear in per&s;on at Stockholm, to frame a treaty of peace, provided GUSTAVUS VASA remained a ho&s;tage on board the Dani&s;h fleet.
