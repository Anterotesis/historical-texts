<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE founded my piece upon two ideas;&mdash;the fir&s;t, a cu&s;tom among the Egyptians, who publicly tried the conduct of their great men after death, and then gave judgment on their me|rit. Secondly, a cu&s;tom of the Greeks and Ro|mans, who pronounced orations over the bodies of their decea&s;ed heroes, or over their a&s;hes when inurned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Ro&s;cius &s;ecundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear few in the&s;e days would pa&s;s the Egyp|tian ordeal immaculate, or merit the Greek or Ro|man oration. But I am &s;urprized, Doctor Plunder, that you, who have &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely for tra|ducing Ma&s;ter Punch, while living, &s;hould now become his Panegyri&s;t; particularly as his <HI>execu|tors</HI> have no <HI>pecuniary</HI> demands upon you. But having &s;hifted off this mortal coil, and be|come defunct, like Zanga's revenge, I &s;uppo&s;e your enmity expired with your foe. You war not with the du&s;t;&mdash;a lion preys not upon carca&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma&s;ter Ro&s;cius &s;ecundus, you have hit the right nail on the head. I hated Punch while liv|ing; but now he is dead, I am determined to be one of his mo&s;t zealous eulogi&s;ts. Our di&s;like aro&s;e from that mutual antipathy which naturally exi&s;ts, not only between dramatic authors, but every cla&s;s of writers, whether coiners, cutters, clippers, or counterfeiters, of literature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Ro&s;cius &s;ecundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;entiments, Doctor, exactly coincide with mine. His failings all lie buried in the grave, and all his good comes ru&s;hing on my &s;oul. Ne|ver will I again mimic his peculiarities with buf|foon drollery. But do you not think the plagia|ri&s;m of our piece will meet the di&s;approbation of the audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: I have only &s;tolen from Shake|&s;peare; and Poets &s;et up a pre&s;criptive right to purloin from him. I am convinced from experi|ence, that Plagiari&s;m meets as much &s;ucce&s;s as Originality. The addition of a few <HI>&s;ongs</HI> to a Tragedy, makes an excellent <HI>Ma&s;que</HI>; and airs ju|diciou&s;ly introduced into a <HI>Cut Comedy,</HI> an&s;wers all the intents, and every end of an <HI>Original Opera.</HI> I know how to &s;ecure the approbation of the public by crook, or by <HI>Hooke.</HI></P>

<P>I will &s;ay that for you, Doctor, you do not de|&s;cend to <HI>petty larceny</HI>; your robberies are open and bold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plead guilty to your arraignment; and the Prologue which you &s;peak to this night's enter|tainment, I have taken, partly from old Jack Dry|den, and partly from Alic Pope. I am like Sir Roger de Coverley's chaplain, who always preach|ed from printed &s;ermons, when unable to com|po&s;e him&s;elf. In dull moods I make bold with the works of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro&s;cius &s;ecundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you not think, Doctor, that the <HI>Monody</HI> is rather too highly elevated in the <HI>hyperbole?</HI> In prai&s;ing your hero, you have made mere cyphers of every other puppet. Like a poet laureat, you
<PB N="13" REF="9">
have centered every virtue, merit, and qualifica|tion, in an individual; which is out-heroding Herod, and an in&s;ult upon common-&s;en&s;e and mo|de&s;ty.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adieu! I will retire, and write a few puffs for the new&s;papers: I have precedent for puffing my Monody in the public prints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro&s;cius &s;ecundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in your puffs be &s;ure to remember me, as I have not lei&s;ure to puff my&s;elf. I a&s;&s;ure you, Doctor, puffing is often a means of procuring a good engagement; and if you give a critique upon this piece before it is printed, I expect to &s;hine forth in the Critical Review; or, if it be publi&s;hed, to have my per&s;on delineated by Ro|berts, and &s;tuck in the window of Bell's Circu|lating Library.</P>
