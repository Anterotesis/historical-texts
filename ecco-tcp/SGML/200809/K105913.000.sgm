<P>THE NOBLE PEASANT, A COMIC OPERA, IN THREE ACTS; AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN THE HAYMARKET.</P>
<P>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT.</P>
<P>DUBLIN: Printed by J. EXSHAW, for the COMPANY of BOOKSELLERS.</P>
<P>M DCC LXXXIV.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="2">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the ea&s;e and convenience of the Provincial Theatres, as well as to gra|tify the Curio&s;ity of the Reader, tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages and Songs, which were omitted in the Repre&s;entation, are put between inverted Commas. Scenes, which often are tedious in the Theatre, amu&s;e in the Clo&s;et; and it would, perhaps, be an experiment not much to the advantage of mo&s;t Theatrical Productions, to re&s;tore, on any Stage, Pa&s;|&s;ages which, without great Experience, it would be difficult to give a rea&s;on, why they &s;hould not be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The Fable relates to Times &s;o remote, that the ta&s;k of &s;upporting dialogue, in which Wit is nece&s;&s;ary, and yet of not of|fending the manners of tho&s;e Times, is no ea&s;y one. Glory is often acquired in pro|portion as impediments are overcome: Far be it, however, from the Author to in&s;i|nuate in what degree he is intitled to this kind of prai&s;e; that Deci&s;ion re&s;ts with the Public, and it cannot be in hands more equitable.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">
Ambitious of deriving Fame from a &s;ource whence Fame has &s;o often flowed, from Poetry, the Author has paid an attention to the Songs, which he hopes the Lovers of Poetry will approve. Should they really po&s;&s;e&s;s Excellence, it is &s;till to be expected it mu&s;t oftcn remain unnoticed. The Po|etical Beauties of the Songs in the Duenna are frequently overlooked, but they are not therefore the le&s;s beautiful. In &s;ome in|&s;tances Poetry has here been obliged to give place to Situation and other Accidents, and pretends to no Charms.</P>
<P>To Mr. Shield, the Author of the Mu&s;ic, every Prai&s;e, every Re&s;pect is due! The univer&s;al Admiration he has received on this, as well as on various former occa&s;ions, mu&s;t give Plea&s;ure to every ingenuous mind: For who can forbear being happy at the pro&s;pe|rity of a Man, who&s;e Head and who&s;e Heart are equally &s;uperior? The NOBLE PEASANT owes much, very much of its &s;ucce&s;s to the Genius of the Mu&s;ician. The Airs not only po&s;&s;e&s;s Sweetne&s;s and Originality, but they are learned likewi&s;e; and, what is far to be preferred, they have Pa&s;&s;ion and Enthu&s;ia&s;m: The very Accompaniments are full of the&s;e ine&s;timable Qualities. If Friend&s;hip be not more than partial, the fir&s;t Song in the third Act is, in particular, in all its Parts, worthy of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ter Harmony ever in|&s;pired:
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
and yet, to &s;ingle out this Song, on|ly, is doing great inju&s;tice to the re&s;t. There is little danger, indeed, in declaring &s;uch Opinions, for every one declares the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To all tho&s;e who&s;e Talents have contribut|ed to the &s;ucce&s;s of this Opera, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t, the Author returns his Thanks. He forbears to recite Names, be|cau&s;e di&s;tinctions are difficult; and becau&s;e he cannot, without an appearance of &s;eeking to flatter, mention them with all the Re&s;pect he wi&s;hes, &s;hould he mention them at all.</P>
