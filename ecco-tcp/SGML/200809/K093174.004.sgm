<HEAD>PERSEVERANCE, AGAINST FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A STORY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THEODORE</HI> was a boy of lively parts and engaging manners; but he had the failing of being extremely impatient in his temper, and inclined to extremes. He was ardent in all his pur&s;uits, but could bear no di&s;appointment; and if the lea&s;t thing went wrong, he threw up what he was about in a pet, and could not be prevailed upon to re&s;ume it. His father (Mr. <HI>Carleton</HI>) had given him a bed in the garden, which he had culti|vated with great delight. The borders were &s;et with double dai&s;ies of different colours, next to which was a row of auriculas and polyanthu&s;es. Beyond
<PB N="2" REF="5">
were &s;tocks and other taller flowers and &s;hrubs; and a beautiful dama&s;k ro&s;e graced the centre. This ro&s;e was ju&s;t budding, and <HI>Theodore</HI> watched its daily progre&s;s with great intere&s;t. One un|fortunate day, the door of the garden being left open, a drove of pigs entered, and began to riot on the herbs and flowers. An alarm being &s;ounded, <HI>Theodore</HI> and the &s;ervant boy ru&s;hed upon them, &s;macking their whips. The whole herd in affright, took their cour&s;e acro&s;s <HI>Theodore</HI>'s flower-bed, on which &s;ome of them had before been grazing. Stocks, dai&s;ies, and auri|culas were all trampled down or torn up; and what was wor&s;t of all, a large old &s;ow ran directly over the beautiful ro&s;e tree, and broke off its &s;tem level with the ground. When <HI>Theodore</HI> came up, and beheld all the mi&s;chief, and e&s;|pecially his favourite ro&s;e &s;trewed on the &s;oil, rage and grief choaked his utter|ance. After &s;tanding a while, the pic|ture
<PB N="3" REF="6">
of de&s;pair, he &s;natched up a &s;pade that &s;tood near, and with furious ha&s;te dug over the whole bed, and whelmed all the relics of his flowers deep under the &s;oil. This exertion being ended, he bur&s;t into tears, and &s;ilently left the garden.</P>
<P>His father, who had beheld the &s;cene at a di&s;tance, though &s;omewhat diverted at the boy's childi&s;h violence, yet began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the future con&s;e|quences of &s;uch a temper, if &s;uffered to grow up without re&s;traint. He &s;aid nothing to him at the time, but in the afternoon he took him a walk into a neighbouring pari&s;h. There was a large wild common, and at the &s;kirts of it, a neat farm-hou&s;e, with fields lying round it, all well fenced, and cul|tivated in the be&s;t manner. The air was &s;weetened with the bean-flower and clover. An orchard of fine young fruit trees lay behind the hou&s;e; and before it, a little garden, gay with all the flowers
<PB N="4" REF="7">
of the &s;ea&s;on. A &s;tand of bee-hives was on the &s;outhern &s;ide, &s;heltered by a thick hedge of honey&s;uckle and &s;weet-briar. The farm-yard was &s;tocked with pigs and poultry. A herd of cows with full udders, was ju&s;t coming home to be milked. Every thing wore the a&s;pect of plenty and good management. The charms of the &s;cene &s;truck <HI>Theodore</HI> very forcibly, and he expre&s;&s;ed his plea&s;ure in the warme&s;t terms. This place, &s;aid his father, belongs to a man who is the greate&s;t example I know of patient for|titude bearing up again&s;t misfortune; and all that you &s;ee is the reward of his own per&s;everance. I am a little ac|quainted with him; and we will go in and beg a draught of milk, and try if we can prevail upon him to tell us his &s;tory. <HI>Theodore</HI> willingly accompanied his father. They were received by the farmer with cordial frankne&s;s. After they were &s;eated, Mr. <HI>Hardman,</HI> (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Carleton</HI>) I have often heard of part
<PB N="5" REF="8">
of your adventures, but never had a regular account of the whole. If you will favour me and my little boy with the &s;tory of them, we &s;hall think our|&s;elves much obliged to you. Lack a day! &s;ir, (&s;aid he) there's little in them worth telling of, as far as I know. I have had my ups and downs in the world, to be &s;ure, but &s;o have many men be&s;ide. However, if you wi&s;h to hear about them, they are at your &s;ervice; and I can't &s;ay but it gives me plea&s;ure &s;ome|times to talk over old matters, and think how much better things have turned out than might have been expected. Now I am of opinion (&s;aid Mr. <HI>C.</HI>) that from your &s;pirit and per&s;everance a good con|clu&s;ion might always have been ex|pected. You are plea&s;ed to compli|ment, &s;ir (replied the farmer); but I will begin without more words.</P>
<P>You may perhaps have heard that my father was a man of good e&s;tate. He thought of nothing, poor man! but
<PB N="6" REF="9">
how to &s;pend it; and he had the un|common luck to &s;pend it twice over. For when he was obliged to &s;ell it the fir&s;t time, it was bought in by a relation, who left it him again by his will. But my poor father was not a man to take warning. He fell to living as he had done before, and ju&s;t made his e&s;tate and his life hold out together. He died at the age of five and forty, and left his family beggars. I believe he would not have taken to drinking as he did, had it not been for his impatient temper, which made him fret and vex him&s;elf for every trifie, and then he had nothing for it but to drown his care in liquor.</P>
<P>It was my lot to be taken by my mo|ther's brother, who was ma&s;ter of a mer|chant &s;hip. I &s;erved him as an apprentice &s;everal years, and underwent a good deal of the u&s;ual hard&s;hip of a &s;ailor's life. He had ju&s;t made me his mate in a voyage up the Mediterranean, when we had the misfortune to be wrecked on
<PB N="7" REF="10">
the coa&s;t of Morocco. The &s;hip &s;truck at &s;ome di&s;tance from &s;hore, and we lay a long &s;tormy night with the waves da&s;hing over us, expecting every mo|ment to peri&s;h. My uncle and &s;everal of the crew died of fatigue and want, and by morning but four of us were left alive. My companions were &s;o di&s;|heartened, that they thought of no|thing but &s;ubmitting to their fate. For my part, I thought life &s;till worth &s;trug|gling for; and the weather having be|come calmer, I per&s;uaded them to join me in making a kind of raft, by the help of which, with much toil and dan|ger, we reached the land, Here we were &s;eized by the barbarous inhabitants, and carried up the country for &s;laves to the emperor. We were employed about &s;ome public buildings, made to work very hard with the whip at our backs, and allowed nothing but water and a kind of pul&s;e. I have heard per&s;ons talk as if there was little in be|ing
<PB N="8" REF="11">
a &s;lave but the name; but they who have been &s;laves them&s;elves, I am &s;ure will never make light of &s;lavery in others. A ran&s;om was &s;et on our heads, but &s;o high, that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible for poor friendle&s;s creatures like us ever to pay it. The thought of perpetual &s;ervitude, together with the hard treatment we met with, quite overcame my poor com|panions. They drooped and died one after another. I &s;till thought it not impo&s;&s;ible to mend my condition, and perhaps to recover my freedom. We worked about twelve hours in the day, and had one holiday in the week. I employed my lei&s;ure time in learning to make mats and flag ba&s;kets, in which I &s;oon became &s;o expert, as to have a good many for &s;ale, and thereby got a little money to purcha&s;e better food, and &s;everal &s;mall conveniencies. We were afterwards &s;et to work in the emperor's gardens; and here I &s;howed &s;o much good-will and attention, that I got into
<PB N="9" REF="12">
favour with the over&s;eer. He had a large garden of his own; and he made intere&s;t for me to be &s;uffered to work for him alone, on the condition of paying a man to do my duty. I &s;oon became &s;o u&s;eful to him, that he treated me more like a hired &s;er|vant than a &s;lave, and gave me regu|lar wages. I learned the language of the country, and might have pa&s;&s;ed my time comfortably enough, could I have accommodated my&s;elf to their manners and religion, and forgot my native land. I &s;aved all I could, in order to purcha&s;e my freedom; but the ran&s;om was &s;o high, that I had little pro&s;pect of being able to do it for &s;ome years to come. A cir|cum&s;tance, however, happened which brought it about at once. Some vil|lains one night laid a plot to murder my ma&s;ter and plunder his hou&s;e. I &s;lept in a little &s;hed in the garden where the tools lay; and being awak|ened
<PB N="10" REF="13">
by a noi&s;e, I &s;aw four men break through the fence, and walk up an alley towards the hou&s;e. I crept out with a &s;pade in my hand, and &s;ilently followed them. They made a hole with in&s;truments in the hou&s;e-wall big enough for a man to enter at. Two of them had got in, and the third was be|ginning to enter, when I ru&s;hed for|ward, and with a blow of my &s;pade clove the &s;kull of one of the robbers, and gave the other &s;uch a &s;troke on the &s;houlder, as di&s;abled him. I then made a loud outcry to alarm the fa|mily. My ma&s;ter and his &s;on, who lay in the hou&s;e, got up, and having let me in, we &s;ecured the two others, after a &s;harp conflict, in which I received a &s;evere wound with a dagger. My ma&s;|ter, who looked upon me as his pre|&s;erver, had all po&s;&s;ible care taken of me; and as &s;oon as I was cured, made me a pre&s;ent of my liberty. He would fain have kept me with him, but my
<PB N="11" REF="14">
mind was &s;o much bent on returning to my native country, that I imme|diately &s;et out to the neare&s;t &s;eaport, and took my pa&s;&s;age in a ve&s;&s;el going to Gibraltar.</P>
<P>From this place I returned in the fir&s;t &s;hip for England. As &s;oon as we arrived in the Downs, and I was rejoic|ing at the &s;ight of the white cliffs, a man-of-war's boat came on board, and pre&s;&s;ed into the king's &s;ervice all of us who were &s;eamen. I could not but think it hard that this &s;hould be my welcome at home after a long &s;lavery; but there was no remedy. I re&s;olved to do my duty in my &s;tation, and leave the re&s;t to providence. I was abroad during the remainder of the war, and &s;aw many a &s;tout fellow &s;ink under di&s;|ea&s;e and de&s;pondence. My knowledge of &s;eaman&s;hip got me promoted to the po&s;t of a petty officer, and at the peace I was paid off, and received a pretty &s;um for wages and prize|money.
<PB N="12" REF="15">
With this I &s;et off for Lon|don. I had experienced too much di&s;tre&s;s from want, to be inclined to &s;quander away my money, &s;o I put it into a banker's hands, and began to look out for &s;ome new way of life.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there were &s;ome things of which I had no more expe|rience than a child, and the tricks of London were among the&s;e. An ad|verti&s;ement offering extraordinary ad|vantages to a partner in a commercial concern, who could bring a &s;mall ca|pital, tempted me to make enquiry about the matter; and I was &s;oon ca|joled by a plau&s;ible artful fellow to ven|ture my whole &s;tock in it. The bu&s;i|ne&s;s was a manufacture, about which I knew nothing at all; but as I was not afraid of my labour, I &s;et about work|ing as they directed me, with great di|ligence, and thought all was going on pro&s;perou&s;ly. One morning, on com|ing to the office, I found my partners
<PB N="13" REF="16">
decamped; and the &s;ame day I was arre&s;ted for a con&s;iderable &s;um due by the partner&s;hip. It was in vain for me to think of getting bail, &s;o I was obliged to go to pri&s;on. Here I &s;hould have been half &s;tarved, but for my Moori&s;h trade of mat-making, by the help of which I bettered my condition for &s;ome months; when the creditors, finding that nothing could be got out of me, &s;uffered me to be &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>I was now in the wide world with|out a farthing or a friend, but I thanked God that I had health and limbs left. I did not choo&s;e to tru&s;t the &s;ea again, but preferred my other new trade of gardening; &s;o I applied to a nur&s;ery|man near town, and was received as a day-labourer. I &s;et my&s;elf cheerfully to work, taking care to be in the grounds the fir&s;t man in the morning and the la&s;t at night. I acquainted my employer with all the practices I had ob&s;erved in Morocco, and got
<PB N="14" REF="17">
him, in return, to in&s;truct me in his own. In time, I came to be con&s;i|dered as a &s;kilful workman, and was advanced to higher wages. My affairs were in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. I was well fed and comfortably lodged, and &s;aved money into the bargain. About this time I fell in company with a young woman at &s;ervice, very notable and well behaved, who &s;eemed well qua|lified for a wi&s;e to a working man. I ventured to make an offer to her, which proved not di&s;agreeable; and after we had calculated a little how we were to live, we married. I took a cottage with an acre or two of land to it, and my wife's &s;avings furni&s;h|ed our hou&s;e and bought a cow. All my lei&s;ure time I &s;pent upon my piece of ground, which I made very productive, and the profits of my cow, with my wages, &s;upported us very well. No mortal, I think, could be happier than I was after a hard day's
<PB N="15" REF="18">
work, by my own fire&s;ide, with my wi&s;e be&s;ide me, and our little infant on my knee.</P>
<P>After this way of life had la&s;ted two or three years, a gentleman who had dealt largely with my ma&s;ter for young plants, a&s;ked him if he could re|commend an hone&s;t indu&s;trious man for a tenant, upon &s;ome land that he had lately taken in from the &s;ea. My ma&s;ter, willing to do me a kind|ne&s;s, mentioned me. I was tempted by the propo&s;al, and going down to view the premi&s;es, I took a farm upon a lea&s;e at a low rent, and re|moved my family and goods to it, one hundred and fifty miles from Lon|don. There was ground enough for money, but much was left to be done for it in draining, manuring, and fenc|ing. Then it required more &s;tock than I was able to furni&s;h; &s;o, though unwilling, I was obliged to bor|row &s;ome money of my landlord, who

let me have it at moderate intere&s;t. I began with good heart, and worked late and early to put things in the be&s;t condition. My fir&s;t misfortune was, that the place proved unhealthy to us. I fell into a lingering ague, which pull|ed me down much, and hindered my bu&s;ine&s;s. My wife got a &s;low fever, and &s;o did our elde&s;t child (we had now two, and another coming). The poor child died; and what with grief and illne&s;s, my wife had much ado to recover. Then the rot got among my &s;heep, and carried off the be&s;t part of my flock. I bore up again&s;t di&s;tre&s;s as well as I could; and by the kindne&s;s of my landlord was enabled to bring things tolerably about again. We re|gained our health, and began to be &s;ea|&s;oned to the climate. As we were cheering our&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of better times, a dreadful &s;torm aro&s;e&mdash;it was one night in February&mdash;I &s;hall never forget it&mdash;and drove the &s;pring tide
<PB N="17" REF="22">
with &s;uch fury again&s;t our &s;ea-banks, that they gave way. The water ru&s;hed in with &s;uch force, that all was pre|&s;ently a &s;ea. Two hours before day|light, I was awaked by the noi&s;e of the waves da&s;hing again&s;t our hou&s;e, and bur&s;ting in at the door. My wife had lain in about a month, and &s;he and I, and the two children, &s;lept on a ground floor. We had ju&s;t time to carry the children up &s;tairs, before all was afloat in the room. When day appeared, we could &s;ee nothing from the windows but water. All the out|hou&s;es, ricks, and uten&s;ils were &s;wept away, and all the cattle and &s;heep drowned. The &s;ea kept ri&s;ing, and the force of the current bore &s;o hard again&s;t our hou&s;e, that we thought every moment it mu&s;t fall. We cla&s;ped our babies to our brea&s;ts, and expected nothing but pre&s;ent death. At length we &s;pied a boat coming to us. With a good deal
<PB N="18" REF="23">
of difficulty it got under our window, and took us in with a &s;ervant maid and boy. A few clothes was all the pro|perty we &s;aved; and we had not left the hou&s;e half an hour, before it fell, and in a minute nothing was to be &s;een of it. Not only the farm-hou&s;e, but the farm it&s;elf was gone.</P>
<P>I was now again a ruined man, and what was wor&s;t, I had three partners in my ruin. My wife and I looked at one another, and then at our little ones, and wept. Neither of us had a word of comfort to &s;ay. At la&s;t, thought I, this country is not Morocco, however. Here are good &s;ouls that will pity our ca&s;e, and perhaps relieve us. Then I have a character, and a pair of hands. Things are bad, but they might have been wor&s;e. I took my wife by the hand and knelt down. She did the &s;ame. I thanked God for his mercy in &s;aving our lives, and prayed that he would continue to protect us. We
<PB N="19" REF="24">
ro&s;e up with lightened hearts, and were able to talk calmly about our condition. It was my de&s;ire to return to my former ma&s;ter, the nur&s;ery-man; but how to convey my family &s;o far without money was the difficulty. Indeed I was much wor&s;e than nothing, for I owed a good deal to my landlord. He came down upon the news of the misfortune, and though his own lo&s;&s;es were heavy, he not only forgave my debt and relea&s;ed me from all obligations, but made me a &s;mall pre&s;ent. Some charitable neigh|bours did the like; but I was mo&s;t of all affected by the kindne&s;s of our late maid-&s;ervant, who in&s;i&s;ted upon our accepting of a crown which &s;he had &s;aved out of her wages. Poor &s;oul! we had always treated her like one of our&s;elves, and &s;he felt for us like one.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had got &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and the weather was toler|able, we &s;et out on our long march.
<PB N="20" REF="25">
My wife carried her infant in her arms. I took the bigger child upon my back, and a bundle of clothes in my hand. We could walk but a few miles a day, but we now and then got a lift in an empty waggon or cart, which was a great help to us. One day we met with a farmer returning with his team from market, who let us ride, and en|tered into conver&s;ation with me. I told him of my adventures, by which he &s;eemed much intere&s;ted; and learn|ing that I was &s;killed in managing trees, he acquainted me that a nobleman in his neighbourhood was making great plantations, and would very likely be glad to engage me; and he offered to carry us to the place. As all I was &s;eeking was a living by my labour, I thought the &s;ooner I got it, the better; &s;o I thankfully accepted his offer. He took us to the nobleman's &s;teward, and made known our ca&s;e. The &s;teward wrote to my old ma&s;ter for a character;
<PB N="21" REF="26">
and receiving a favourable one, he hired me as a principal manager of a new plantation, and &s;ettled me and my family in a &s;nug cottage near it. He advanced us &s;omewhat for a little furni|ture and pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and we had once more a <HI>home.</HI> O Sir! how many ble&s;&s;ings are contained in that word to tho&s;e who have known the want of it!</P>
<P>I entered upon my new employment with as much &s;atisfaction, as if I was taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate. My wife had enough to do in taking care of the hou&s;e and children; &s;o it lay with me to provide for all, and I may &s;ay that I was not idle. Be&s;ides my weekly pay from the &s;teward, I con|trived to make a little money at lei&s;ure times by pruning and dre&s;&s;ing gentle|men's fruit trees. I was allowed a piece of wa&s;te ground behind the hou&s;e for a garden, and I &s;pent a good deal of labour in bringing it
<PB N="22" REF="27">
into order. My old ma&s;ter &s;ent me down for a pre&s;ent &s;ome choice young trees and flower roots, which I planted, and they throve wonder|fully. Things went on almo&s;t as well as I could de&s;ire. The &s;itua|tion being dry and healthy, my wife recovered her lo&s;t bloom, and the children &s;prung up like my plants. I began to hope that I was almo&s;t out of the reach of further misfor|tune; but it was not &s;o ordered.</P>
<P>I had been three years in this &s;itu|ation, and increa&s;ed my family with another child, when my Lord died. He was &s;ucceeded by a very di&s;&s;i|pated young man, deep in debt, who pre&s;ently put a &s;top to the planting and improving of the e&s;tate, and &s;ent orders to turn off all the workmen. This was a great blow to me; how|ever, I &s;till hoped to be allowed to keep my little hou&s;e and garden, and I thought I could then maintain my|&s;elf
<PB N="23" REF="28">
as a nur&s;ery-man and gardener. But a new &s;teward was &s;ent down, with directions to rack the tenants to the utmo&s;t. He a&s;ked me as much rent for the place as if I had found the garden ready made to my hands; and when I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to pay it, he gave me notice to quit immediately. He would neither &s;uffer me to take away my trees and plants, nor allow me any thing for them. His view, I found, was to put in a favourite of his own, and &s;et him up at my expence. I remon&s;trated again&s;t this cruel inju&s;tice, but could obtain nothing but hard words. As I &s;aw it would be the ruin of me to be turned out in that manner, I determined, rather ha&s;tily, to go up to London and plead my cau&s;e with my new Lord. I took a &s;orrowful leave of my family, and walking to the next market town, I got a place on the out&s;ide of the &s;tage coach.
<PB N="24" REF="29">
When we were within thirty or forty miles of London, the coachman over|turned the carriage, and I pitched directly on my head, and was taken up &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Nobody knew any thing about me; &s;o I was carried to the next village, where the over&s;eer had me taken to the pari&s;h workhou&s;e. Here I lay a fortnight, much neglected, before I came to my &s;en&s;es. As &s;oon as I became &s;en&s;ible of my condition, I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted in thinking of the di&s;tre&s;s my poor wife, who was near lying-in, mu&s;t be under on my ac|count, not hearing any thing of me. I lay another fortnight before I was fit to travel, for, be&s;ides the hurt on my head, I had a broken collar-bone, and &s;everal brui&s;es. My money had &s;ome|how all got out of my pocket, and I had no other means of getting away than by being pa&s;&s;ed to my own pari&s;h. I returned in &s;ad plight indeed, and found my wife very ill in bed. My
<PB N="25" REF="30">
children were crying about her, and almo&s;t &s;tarving. We &s;hould now have been quite lo&s;t, had I not rai&s;ed a little money by &s;elling our furniture; for I was yet unable to work. As &s;oon as my wife was &s;omewhat recover|ed, we were forced to quit our hou&s;e. I cried like a child on leaving my blooming garden and flouri&s;hing plan|tations, and was almo&s;t tempted to demoli&s;h them, rather than another &s;hould unju&s;tly reap the fruit of my labours. But I checked my&s;elf, and I am glad I did. We took lodgings in a neighbouring village, and I went round among the gentlemen of the country to &s;ee if I could get a little employment. In the mean time the former &s;teward came down to &s;ettle accounts with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and was much concerned to find me in &s;uch a &s;ituation. He was a very able and hone&s;t man, and had been en|gaged by another nobleman to &s;u|perintend
<PB N="26" REF="31">
a large improveable e&s;tate in a di&s;tant part of the kingdom. He told me, if I would try my for|tune with him once more, he would endeavour to procure me a new &s;et|tlement. I had nothing to lo&s;e, and therefore was willing enough to run any hazard, but I was de&s;titute of means to convey my family to &s;uch a di&s;|tance. My good friend, who was much provoked at the inju&s;tice of the new &s;teward, &s;aid &s;o much to him, that he brought him to make me an allowance for my garden; and with that I was enabled to make another removal. It was to the place I now inhabit.</P>
<P>When I came here, Sir, all this farm was a naked common, like that you cro&s;&s;ed in coming. My Lord got an enclo&s;ure bill for his part of it, and the &s;teward divided it into different farms, and let it on improving lea&s;es to &s;everal tenants.
<PB N="27" REF="32">
A dreary &s;pot, to be &s;ure, it looked at fir&s;t, enough to &s;ink a man's heart to &s;it down upon it! I had a little unfini&s;hed cottage given me to live in, and as I had nothing to &s;tock a farm, I was for &s;ome years employed as head labourer and planter about the new enclo&s;ures. By very hard working and &s;aving, together with a little help, I was at length enabled to take a &s;mall part of the ground I now occupy. I had various di&s;|couragements, from bad &s;ea&s;ons and other accidents. One year the di&s;|temper carried off four out of &s;even cows that I kept; another year I lo&s;t two of my be&s;t hor&s;es. A high wind once almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed an orchard I had ju&s;t planted, and blew down my bigge&s;t barn. But I was too much u&s;ed to misfortunes to be ea&s;ily di&s;heartened, and my way always was to &s;et about repairing them in the be&s;t manner I could, and leave
<PB N="28" REF="33">
the re&s;t to Heaven. This method &s;eems to have an&s;wered at la&s;t. I have now gone on many years in a cour&s;e of continued pro&s;perity, add|ing field to field, increa&s;ing my &s;tock, and bringing up a numerous family with credit. My dear wife, who was my faithful partner through &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s, continues to &s;hare my pro&s;perous &s;tate; and few couples in the kingdom, I believe, have more cau&s;e to be thankful for their lot. This, Sir, is my hi&s;tory. You &s;ee it contains nothing very extraordinary; but if it impre&s;&s;es on the mind of this young gentleman the maxim, that pa|tience and per&s;everance will &s;carcely fail of a good i&s;&s;ue in the end, the time you have &s;pent in li&s;tening to it will not entirely be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Carleton</HI> thanked the good far|mer very heartily for the amu&s;ement and in&s;truction he had afforded them, and took leave with many expre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="29" REF="34">

<P>Next morning, Mr. <HI>C.</HI> looking out of window, &s;aw <HI>Theodore</HI> hard at work in his garden. He was carefully di&s;interring his buried flowers, trim|ming and cleaning them, and planting them anew. He had got the gardener to cut a &s;lip of the broken ro&s;e-tree, and &s;et it in the middle to give it a chance for growing. By noon every thing was laid &s;mooth and neat, and the bed was well filled. All its &s;plendour, indeed, was gone for the pre&s;ent, but it &s;eemed in a hopeful way to revive again. <HI>Theodore</HI> looked with plea&s;ure over his work; but his father felt more plea&s;ure in witne&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t fruits of farmer <HI>Hardman</HI>'s &s;tory.</P>

<P><HI>George</HI> and <HI>Harry,</HI> with their Tutor, one day in their walk, were driven by the rain to take &s;helter in a black&s;mith's &s;hed. The &s;hower la&s;ting &s;ome time, the boys, in order to amu&s;e them&s;elves, began to examine the things around them. The great bellows fir&s;t attracted their notice, and they admired the roar|ing it made, and the expedition with which it rai&s;ed the fire to a heat too inten&s;e for them to look at. They were &s;urpri&s;ed at the dexterity with which the &s;mith fa&s;hioned a bar of iron into a hor&s;e&s;hoe; fir&s;t heating it, then hammering it well on the anvil, cutting off a proper length, bending it

round, turning up the ends, and la&s;tly, punching the nail-holes. They watched the whole proce&s;s of fitting it to the hor&s;e's foot, and fa&s;tening it on; and it had become fair &s;ome minutes before they &s;hewed a de&s;ire to leave the &s;hop and proceed on their walk.</P>

<P>Nor I neither, (&s;aid <HI>Harry</HI>).</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was managed, you &s;aw, by the help of fire. The fire made it &s;oft and flexible, &s;o that the &s;mith could ea&s;ily hammer it, and cut it, and bend it to the &s;hape he wanted; and then dipping it in water, made it hard again.</P>

<P>Yes, &s;everal; and if you have a mind I will tell you about them, and their u&s;es.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes; I &s;hould like to hear it of all things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then. Fir&s;t let us con|&s;ider what a metal is. Do you think you &s;hould know one from a &s;tone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;tone!&mdash;Yes, I could not mi&s;take a piece of lead or iron for a &s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>How would you di&s;tingui&s;h it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>A metal is bright and &s;hining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;brilliance is one of their qualities. But gla&s;s and cry&s;tal are very bright, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But one may &s;ee through gla&s;s, and not through a piece of metal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. Metals are brilliant, but opake, or not tran&s;parent. The thin|ne&s;t plate of metal that can be made,
<PB N="33" REF="38">
will keep out the light as effectually as a &s;tone wall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Metals are very heavy, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. They are the heavie&s;t bodies in nature; for the lighte&s;t metal is nearly twice as heavy as the heavie&s;t &s;tone. Well, what el&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they will bear beating with a hammer, which a &s;tone would not, without flying in pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; that property of extending or &s;preading under the hammer is called <HI>malleability;</HI> and another, like it, is that of bearing to be drawn out into a wire, which is called <HI>ductility.</HI> Metals have both the&s;e, and much of their u&s;e de|pends upon them.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Metals will melt, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! will iron melt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; all metals will melt, though &s;ome require greater heat than others. The property of melting is called <HI>fu&s;i|bility.</HI> Do you know any thing more about them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="39">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; except that they come out of the ground, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is properly added, for it is the circum&s;tance which makes them rank among <HI>fo&s;&s;ils,</HI> or minerals. To &s;um up their character, then, a metal is a brilliant, opake, heavy, malleable, ductile, and fu&s;ible mineral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I can hardly remember all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>names</HI> may &s;lip your me|mory, but you cannot &s;ee metals at all u&s;ed without being &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>things.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are <HI>ores?</HI> I remember &s;eeing a heap of iron ore which men were breaking with hammers, and it looked only like &s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>ore</HI> of a metal is the &s;tate in which it is generally met with in the earth, when it is &s;o mixed with &s;tony and other matters, as not to &s;how its proper qualities as a metal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do people know it, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="35" REF="40">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>By experience. It was probably accident that in the early ages di&s;|covered that certain fo&s;&s;ils by the force of fire might be made to yield a metal. The experiment was repeated on other fo&s;&s;ils; &s;o that in length of time all the different metals were found out, and all the different forms in which they lie concealed in the ground. The know|ledge of this is called <HI>Mineralogy,</HI> and a very important &s;cience it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;o; for metals are very valuable things. Our next neigh|bour, Mr. Sterling, I have heard, gets a great deal of money every year from his mines in Wales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does. The mineral riches of &s;ome countries are much &s;uperior to that of their products above ground, and the revenues of many kings are in great part derived from their mines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t be gold and &s;ilver mines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e, to be &s;ure, are the mo&s;t valuable, if the metals are found in to|lerable abundance. But do you know why they are &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e money is made of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a principal rea&s;on, no doubt. But the&s;e metals have intrin&s;ic properties that make them highly valu|able, el&s;e probably they would not have been cho&s;en in &s;o many countries to make money of. In the fir&s;t place, gold and &s;ilver are both <HI>perfect metals,</HI> that is, inde&s;tructible in the fire. Other metals, if kept a con&s;iderable time in the fire, change by degrees into a pow|dery or &s;caly matter, called a calx. You have melted lead, I dare &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, often.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not, then, perceived a dro&s;&s;y film collect upon its &s;urface after it had been kept melting a while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="42">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a calx; and in time the whole lead would change to &s;uch a &s;ub|&s;tance. You may &s;ee, too, when you have heated the poker red-hot, fome &s;cales &s;eparate from it, which are brit|tle and dro&s;&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;the kitchen poker is al|mo&s;t burnt away by putting it in the fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;All metals undergo the&s;e changes, except gold and &s;ilver; but the&s;e, if kept ever &s;o long in the hotte&s;t fire, &s;u&s;tain no lo&s;s or change. They are therefore called <HI>perfect metals.</HI> Gold has &s;everal other remarkable properties. It is the heavie&s;t of all metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is it heavier than lead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;above half as heavy again. It is between nineteen and twenty times heavier than an equal bulk of water. This great weight is a ready means of di&s;covering counterfeit gold coin
<PB N="38" REF="43">
from genuine; for as gold mu&s;t be adul|terated with &s;omething much lighter than it&s;elf, a fal&s;e coin, if of the &s;ame weight with the true, will be &s;en&s;ibly bigger. Gold, too, is the mo&s;t ductile of all metals. You have &s;een leaf|gold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I bought a book of it once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leaf-gold is made by beating a plate of gold placed between pieces of &s;kin, with heavy hammers, till it is &s;pread out to the mo&s;t degree of thinne&s;s. And &s;o great is its capacity for being extended, that a &s;ingle grain of the metal, which would be &s;carce bigger than a large pin's head, is beat out to a &s;urface of fifty &s;quare inches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is wonderful indeed! but I know leaf gold mu&s;t be very thin, for it will almo&s;t float upon the air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="44">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>By drawing gold out to a wire, it may be &s;till further extended. Gold|wire, as it is called, is made with &s;ilver, overlaid with a &s;mall proportion of gold, and they are drawn out together. In the wire commonly u&s;ed for laces, and embroidery, and the like, a grain of gold is made completely to cover a length of three hundred and fifty-two feet; and when it is &s;tretched &s;till farther by &s;latting, it will reach four hundred and one feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prodigious! What a va&s;t way a guinea might be drawn out, then!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the gold of a guinea at that rate, would reach above nine miles and a half. This property in gold of being capable of exten&s;ion to &s;o extraordinary a degree, is owing to its great tenacity or cohe&s;ion of particles, which is &s;uch, that you can &s;carcely break a piece of gold wire by twi&s;ting it; and a wire of gold will &s;u&s;tain a greater weight
<PB N="40" REF="45">
than one of any other metal, equally thick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it would make very good wire for hanging bells.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would; but &s;uch bell-hanging would come rather too dear. Another valuable quality of gold is its fine co|lour. You know, &s;carce any thing makes a more &s;plendid appearance than gilding. And a peculiar advan|tage of it is; that gold is not liable to ru&s;t or tarni&s;h as other metals are. It will keep its colour fre&s;h for a great many years in a pure and clear air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember the vane of the church &s;teeple was new gilt two years ago, and it looks as well as at fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>This property of not ru&s;ting would render gold very u&s;eful for a variety of purpo&s;es, if it were more common. It would make excellent cooking uten&s;ils, water pipes, mathe|matical in&s;truments, clock-work, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="46">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not gold &s;oft? I have &s;een pieces of gold bent double.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it is next in &s;oftne&s;s to lead, and therefore when it is made into coin, or u&s;ed for any common purpo&s;es, it is mixed with a &s;mall proportion of &s;ome other metal, in order to harden it. This is called its <HI>alloy.</HI> Our gold coin has one-twelfth part of alloy, which is a mixture of &s;ilver and copper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>How beautiful new gold coin is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;&s;carce any metal takes a &s;tamp or impre&s;&s;ion better; and it is capable of a very fine poli&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What countries yield the mo&s;t gold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>South America, the Ea&s;t Indies, and the coa&s;t of Africa. Europe af|fords but little; yet a moderate quan|tity is got every year from Hungary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read of rivers rolling &s;ands of gold. Is there any truth in that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The poets, as u&s;ual, have greatly exaggerated the matter; however, there are various &s;treams in different parts of the world, the &s;ands of which con|tain particles of gold, and &s;ome of them in &s;uch quantity as to be worth the &s;earch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does the gold come there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is wa&s;hed down along with the &s;oil from mountains by the torrents, which are the &s;ources of rivers. Some per&s;ons &s;ay that all &s;ands contain gold; but I would not advi&s;e you to take the pains to &s;earch for it in our common &s;and; for in more &s;en&s;es than one, <HI>gold may be bought too dear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what a fine thing it would be to find a gold mine on one's e&s;tate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not &s;o fine as you ima|gine, for many a one does not pay the co&s;t of working. A coal pit would probably be a better thing. Who do

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gyp&s;ies in Hungary. A number of half-&s;tarved, half-naked wretches of that community employ them&s;elves in wa&s;hing and picking the &s;ands of &s;ome mountain-&s;treams in that country which contain gold, from which they obtain ju&s;t profit enough to keep body and &s;oul together; whereas, had they employed them|&s;elves in agriculture or manufactures, they might have got a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Gold almo&s;t all the world over is fir&s;t got by &s;laves, and it makes &s;laves of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s much of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I will be content with a &s;ilver mine.</P>

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no &s;ilver mines pro|perly &s;o called, but &s;ilver is procured

<P>Are not the famous mines of Poto&s;i there?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the other <HI>perfect</HI> metal. It is al&s;o as little liable to ru&s;t as gold, though indeed it readily gets tar|ni&s;hed.</P>

<P>Plate, however, is not made of pure &s;ilver, any more than &s;ilver coin, and &s;ilver uten&s;ils of all kinds. An al|loy is mixed with it, as with gold, to harden it; and that makes it more liable to tarni&s;h.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>To prevent the victuals from getting any taint from the metal of the &s;aucepan: for &s;ilver is not capable of being corroded or di&s;&s;olved by any of
<PB N="46" REF="51">
the liquids u&s;ed for food, as iron or copper are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Does &s;ilver melt ea&s;ily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Silver and gold both melt more difficulty than lead; not till they are above a common red heat. As to the weight of &s;ilver, it is nearly one half le&s;s than that of gold, being only eleven times heavier than water.</P>

<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is quick&s;ilver a kind of &s;ilver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It takes its name from &s;ilver, be|ing very like it in colour; but in re|ality it is a very different thing, and one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular of the metal kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not <HI>malleable,</HI> I am &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; when it is quick or fluid, as it always is in our climate. But a very
<PB N="47" REF="52">
great degree of cold makes it &s;olid, and then it is malleable, like other metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of <HI>killing</HI> quick|&s;ilver; pray what does that mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It means de&s;troying its property of running about, by mixing it with &s;omewhat el&s;e. Thus, if quick&s;ilver be well rubbed with fat, or oil, or gum, it unites with them, lo&s;ing all its metallic appearance and fluidity. It al&s;o unites readily with gold and &s;ilver, and &s;everal other metals, into the form of a kind of &s;hining pa&s;te, which is called an <HI>amalgam.</HI> This is one of the ways of gilding or &s;ilver|ing a thing. Your buttons are gilt by means of an amalgam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;hells of the button, which are made of copper, are &s;haken in a hat with a lump of amalgam of gold and quick&s;ilver, till they are all covered over with it. They are then put into a &s;ort
<PB N="48" REF="53">
of frying-pan and held over the fire. The quick&s;ilver, being very volatile in its nature, flies off in the form of a &s;moke or vapour when it is heated, leaving the gold behind it, &s;pread over the &s;urface of the button. Thus many dozen are gilt at once with the greate&s;t ea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a clever way! I &s;hould like va&s;tly to &s;ee it done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may &s;ee it any day at Bir|mingham, if you happen to be there; as well as a great many other curious operations on metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a weight quick&s;ilver is! I remember taking up a bottle full of it, and I had like to have dropt it again, it was &s;o much heavier than I expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, It is one of the heavie&s;t of the metals&mdash;about fifteen times heavier than water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not <HI>mercury</HI> a name for quick|&s;ilver? I have heard them talk of
<PB N="49" REF="54">
the mercury ri&s;ing and falling in the weather gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. You, perhaps, may have heard too of <HI>mercurial medicines,</HI> which are tho&s;e made of quick&s;ilver prepared in one manner or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they good for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a great variety of complaints. Your brother took &s;ome lately for the worms; and they are often given for breakings-out on the &s;kin, and for &s;ores and &s;wellings. But they have one re|markable effect, when taken in a con|&s;iderable quantity, which is, to loo&s;en the teeth, and cau&s;e a great &s;pitting. This is called &s;alivation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I u&s;ed to think quick&s;ilver was poi&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>When it is in its common &s;tate of running quick&s;ilver, it generally does neither good nor harm; but it may be prepared, &s;o as to be a very violent me|dicine, or even a poi&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it u&s;eful for any thing el&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="50" REF="55">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;for a variety of purpo&s;es in the arts, which I cannot now very well explain to you. But you will per|haps be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that one of the fine&s;t red paints is made from quick|&s;ilver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>A red paint!&mdash;which is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vermillion, or cinnabar, which is a particular mixture of &s;ulphur with quick&s;ilver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is quick&s;ilver found in this coun|try?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The greate&s;t quantity comes from Spain, I&s;tria, and South America. It is a con&s;iderable object of commerce, and bears a high value, though much inferior to &s;ilver. Well&mdash;&s;o much for metals at pre&s;ent. We will talk of the re&s;t on &s;ome future opportunity.</P>

One unlucky day, having gone to the next

market town with &s;ome work, he met with a companion, who took him to the alehou&s;e and treated him. As he was coming away, a recruiting &s;erjeant entered the room, who &s;eeing <HI>Walter</HI> to be a likely young fellow, had a great mind to entrap him. He per&s;uaded him to &s;it down again and take a gla&s;s with him; and kept him in talk with fine &s;tories about a &s;oldier's life, till <HI>Walter</HI> got fuddled before he was aware. The &s;erjeant then clapt a &s;hilling in his hand to drink his maje&s;ty's health, and told him he was enli&s;ted. He was kept there all night, and next morning was taken before a magi&s;trate to be &s;worn in. <HI>Walter</HI> had now become &s;ober, and was very &s;orry for what he had done; but he was told that he could not get off without paying a guinea &s;mart-money. This he knew not how to rai&s;e; and being likewi&s;e afraid and a&s;hamed to face his friends, he took the oath and bounty money, and marched away with

the &s;erjeant without ever returning home. His poor father and mother, when they heard of the affair, were al|mo&s;t heart-broken; and a young wo|man in the village who was his &s;weet|heart, had like to have gone di&s;tracted. <HI>Walter</HI> &s;ent them a line from the fir&s;t &s;tage, to bid them farewell, and comfort them.

<P>You &s;hall hear. One &s;ummer's even|ing, a man in an old red coat, hobbling on crutches, was &s;een to enter the village. His countenance was pale and &s;ickly, his cheeks hollow, and his whole appear|ance be&s;poke extreme wretchedne&s;s. Se|veral people gathered round him, look|ing earne&s;tly in his face.

His father and mother being fetched by &s;ome of the &s;pectators, came and took him in their arms, weep|ing bitterly. I &s;aw the whole &s;cene, and &s;hall never forget it. At length the neighbours helped them into the hou&s;e, where <HI>Walter</HI> told them the following &s;tory.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At the la&s;t great battle that our troops gained in Germany, I was among the fir&s;t engaged, and received a &s;hot that broke my thigh. I fell, and pre|&s;ently after, our regiment was forced to retreat. A &s;quadron of the enemy's hor&s;e came galloping down upon us. A trooper making a blow at me with his &s;abre as I lay, I lifted up my arm to &s;ave my head, and got a cut which divided all the &s;inews at the back of my wri&s;t. Soon after, the enemy were driven back and came acro&s;s us again. A hor&s;e &s;et his foot on my &s;ide, and
<PB N="59" REF="64">
broke three of my ribs. The action was long and bloody, and the wounded on both &s;ides were left on the field all night. A dreadful night it was to me, you may think! I had fainted through lo&s;s of blood, and when I recovered, I was tormented with thir&s;t, and the cold air made my wounds &s;mart intoler|ably. About noon next day, waggons came to carry away tho&s;e who remained alive; and I, with a number of others, was put into one to be conveyed to the next town. The motion of the car|riage was terrible for my broken bones&mdash;every jolt went to my heart. We were taken to an ho&s;pital, which was crammed as full as it could hold; and we &s;hould all have been &s;uffocated with the heat and &s;tench, had not a fever broke out, which &s;oon thinned our numbers. I took it, and was twice given over; however, I &s;truggled through. But my wounds proved &s;o difficult to heal, that it was almo&s;t a twelvemonth be|fore
<PB N="60" REF="65">
I could be di&s;charged. A great deal of the bone of my thigh came away in &s;plinters, and left the limb crooked and u&s;ele&s;s as you &s;ee. I entirely lo&s;t the u&s;e of three fingers of my right hand; and my broken ribs made me &s;pit blood a long time, and have left a cough and difficulty of breathing, which I believe will bring me to my grave. I was &s;ent home and di&s;charged from the army, and I have begged my way hither as well as I could. I am told that the peace has left the affairs of my country ju&s;t as they were before; but who will re&s;tore me my health and limbs? I am put on the li&s;t for a Chel&s;ea pen&s;ioner, which will &s;upport me, if I live to receive it, without be|ing a burden to my friends. That is all that remains for <HI>Walter</HI> now!"</Q></P>

<HEAD>GOOD COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>BESURE, <HI>Frederick,</HI> always keep <HI>good company,</HI> was the final admonition of Mr. <HI>Lofty,</HI> on di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his &s;on to the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>I intreat you, <HI>Henry,</HI> always to choo&s;e <HI>good company,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Manly,</HI> on part|ing with his &s;on to an apprentice&s;hip in a neighbouring town.</P>
<P>But it was impo&s;&s;ible for two people to mean more differently by the &s;ame words.</P>
<P>In Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI>'s idea, good company was that of per&s;ons &s;uperior to our&s;elves in rank and fortune. By this alone he e&s;timated it; and the degrees of com|pari&s;on, better and be&s;t, were made
<PB N="63" REF="68">
exactly to corre&s;pond to &s;uch a &s;cale. Thus, if an e&s;quire was <HI>good</HI> company, a baronet was <HI>better,</HI> and a lord, <HI>be&s;t of all,</HI> provided that he was not a <HI>poor</HI> lord, for in that ca&s;e, a rich gentleman might be at lea&s;t as good. For as, accord|ing to Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI>'s maxim, the great purpo&s;e for which companions were to be cho&s;en, was to advance a young man in the world by their credit and intere&s;t, tho&s;e were to be preferred, who afford|ed the be&s;t pro&s;pects in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Manly,</HI> on the other hand, un|der&s;tood by <HI>good</HI> company, that which was improving to the morals and under|&s;tanding; and by the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> that which to a high degree of the&s;e qualities, added true politene&s;s of manners. As &s;uperior advantages in education to a certain point accompany &s;uperiority of condition, he wi&s;hed his &s;on to prefer as companions tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ituation in life had afforded them the opportunity of being well educated; but he was far from
<PB N="64" REF="69">
de&s;iring him to &s;hun connections with worth and talents, wherever he &s;hould find them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI> had an utter aver&s;ion to <HI>low company,</HI> by which he meant inferiors, people of no fa&s;hion and figure, &s;habby fellows, whom nobody knows.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Manly</HI> equally di&s;liked <HI>low com|pany,</HI> under&s;tanding by it per&s;ons of mean habits and vulgar conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>A great part of Mr. <HI>Manly</HI>'s good company, was Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI>'s low com|pany; and not a few of Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI>'s very be&s;t company, were Mr. <HI>Manly</HI>'s very wor&s;t.</P>
<P>Each of the &s;ons under&s;tood his fa|ther's meaning, and followed his advice.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick,</HI> from the time of his en|trance at the Univer&s;ity, commenced what is called a <HI>Tuft-hunter,</HI> from the tuft in the cap worn by young noble|men. He took pains to in&s;inuate him|&s;elf into the good graces of all the young men of high fa&s;hion in his col|lege,
<PB N="65" REF="70">
and became a con&s;tant companion in their &s;chemes of frolic and di&s;&s;ipation. They treated him with an in&s;olent fami|liarity, often bordering upon contempt; but following another maxim of his fa|ther's, <Q REND="inline">"one mu&s;t &s;toop to ri&s;e,"</Q> he took it all in good part. He totally neglected &s;tudy, as unnece&s;&s;ary, and in|deed incon&s;i&s;tent with his plan. He &s;pent a great deal of money, with which his father, finding that it went in <HI>good company,</HI> at fir&s;t &s;upplied him freely. In time, however, his expences amount|ed to &s;o much, that Mr. <HI>Lofty,</HI> who kept good company too, found it diffi|cult to an&s;wer his demands. A con|&s;iderable &s;um that he lo&s;t at play with one of his noble friends, increa&s;ed the difficulty. If it were not paid, the di&s;|grace of not having di&s;charged a <HI>debt of honour</HI> would lo&s;e him all the favour he had acquired; yet the money could not be rai&s;ed without greatly embarra&s;&s;ing his father's affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="71">
In the mid&s;t of this perplexity, Mr. <HI>Lofty</HI> died, leaving behind him a large family, and very little property. <HI>Fre|derick</HI> came up to town, and &s;oon di&s;&s;i|pated in <HI>good company</HI> the &s;canty portion that came to his &s;hare. Having neither indu&s;try, knowledge, nor reputation, he was then obliged to become an humble dependent on the great, flattering all their follies, and mini&s;tring to their vices, treated by them with mortifying neglect, and equally de&s;pi&s;ed and de|te&s;ted by the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Henry,</HI> in the mean time, entered with &s;pirit into the bu&s;ine&s;s of his new pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and employed his lei&s;ure in cul|tivating an acquaintance with a few &s;elect friends. The&s;e were partly young men in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to his own, partly per&s;ons already &s;ettled in life, but all di&s;tingui&s;hed by propriety of con|duct, and improved under&s;tandings. From all of them he learned &s;omewhat valuable; but he was more particularly
<PB N="67" REF="72">
indebted to two of them, who were in a &s;tation of life inferior to that of the re&s;t. One was a watchmaker, an excellent mechanic and tolerable mathematician, and well acquainted with the con&s;truc|tion and u&s;e of all the in&s;truments employed in experimental philo&s;ophy. The other was a young druggi&s;t, who had a good knowledge of chymi&s;try, and frequently employed him&s;elf in chy|mical operations and experiments. Both of them were men of very decent manners, and took a plea&s;ure in communicating their knowledge to &s;uch as &s;hewed a ta&s;te for &s;imilar &s;tudies. <HI>Henry</HI> fre|quently vi&s;ited them, and derived much u&s;eful information from their in&s;truc|tions, for which he ever expre&s;&s;ed great thankfulne&s;s. The&s;e various occupa|tions and good examples effectually pre&s;erved him from the errors of youth, and he pa&s;&s;ed his time with credit and &s;atisfaction.

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you may; but there are many other kinds of plants extremely like it. It is one of a large family called the <HI>umbelliferous,</HI> which contains both food, phy&s;ic, and poi&s;on. It will be worth while for you to know &s;ome|thing about them, &s;o let us examine this hemlock clo&s;ely. You &s;ee this tall hollow &s;talk, which divides into &s;everal branches, from each of which &s;pring &s;pokes or <HI>rundles</HI> as they are called, of flower-&s;talks. You &s;ee they are like rays from a circle, or the &s;pokes of a wheel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or like the &s;ticks of an umbrella.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and they are called <HI>umbels,</HI> which has the &s;ame derivation.&mdash;If you pur&s;ue one of the&s;e rundles or umbels, you will find that each &s;tick or &s;poke terminates in another &s;et of &s;maller &s;talks, each of which bears a &s;ingle &s;mall flower.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are &s;mall ones indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="79">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you look &s;harply, I dare &s;ay your eyes are good enough to di&s;tingui&s;h that they are divided into five leaves, and furni&s;hed with five chives, and two pi&s;tils in the middle.</P>

<P>I can &s;ee them.</P>

<P>The pi&s;tils are &s;ucceeded by a &s;ort of fruit, which is a twin &s;eed joined in the middle, as you may &s;ee in this rundle that is pa&s;t flowering. Here I divide one of them into two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would each of the&s;e grow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Well&mdash;this is the &s;tructure of the flowering part of all the umbelli|ferous tribe. Now for the leaf. Pluck one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this one leaf, or many?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is properly one, but it is cut and divided into many portions. From this mid-rib &s;pring &s;maller leaves &s;et oppo&s;ite each other; and from the rib of each of the&s;e, proceed others,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
which them&s;elves are al&s;o divided. The&s;e are called doubly or trebly pinnated leaves; and mo&s;t of the um|belliferous plants, but not all, have leaves of this kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is like a par&s;ley leaf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>True&mdash;and par&s;ley is one of the &s;ame tribe, and hemlock and others are &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for it.</P>

<P>Yes. That is one of the marks by which it is known. It is al&s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by its peculiar &s;mell, and by other circum&s;tances which you can only under&s;tand when you have compared a number of the tribe. I will now tell you about &s;ome others, the names of which you are probably acquainted with. In the fir&s;t place, there are carrots and par&s;nips.</P>

<P>They have. It is the <HI>roots</HI> of the&s;e, you know, that are eaten. But we eat the <HI>leaves</HI> of par&s;ley and fennel, which are of the &s;ame cla&s;s. Celery is another, the <HI>&s;talks</HI> of which are chiefly u&s;ed, made white by trenching up the earth about them. The &s;talks of An|gelica are u&s;ed differently.</P>

<P>What, the &s;eeds that are put in cakes and comfits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

All the&s;e are employed in food or medicine, and are good for warming or &s;trengthening the &s;tomach.</P>

<PB N="77" REF="82">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e are plea&s;ant medicines enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are; but you will not &s;ay the &s;ame of &s;ome others of the cla&s;s, which are noted medicines, too; &s;uch as the plant yielding a&s;afetida, and &s;e|veral more, from which what are called the fetid gums are produced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A&s;afetida!&mdash;that's na&s;ty &s;tuff, I know; does it grow here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; and mo&s;t of the &s;weet &s;eeds I before mentioned come from abroad, too. Now I will tell you of &s;ome of the poi&s;ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hemlock is one that we know already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Then there is another kind that grows in water, and is more poi&s;onous, called Water-Hemlock. Another is a large plant growing in ditches, with leaves extremely like celery, called Hemlock-Dropwort. Another, common in drier &s;ituations, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by leaves le&s;s di|vided
<PB N="78" REF="83">
than mo&s;t of the cla&s;s, is Cow-Par&s;nep, or Madnep. Of &s;ome of the&s;e the leaves, of others the roots, are mo&s;t poi&s;onous. Their effects are to make the head giddy, bring on &s;tu|pidity or delirium, and cau&s;e violent &s;ickne&s;s. The Athenians u&s;ed to put criminals to death by making them drink the juice of a kind of hemlock growing in that country, as you may read in the life of that excellent philo&s;o|pher Socrates, who was killed in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was he killed for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e he was wi&s;er and better than his fellow-citizens. Among us it is only by accident that mi&s;chief is done by the&s;e plants. I remember a me|lancholy in&s;tance of a poor boy, who in rambling about the fields with his little brothers and &s;i&s;ters, chanced to meet with a root of Hemlock-Dropwort. It looked &s;o white and nice, that he was tempted to eat a good deal of it.
<PB N="79" REF="84">
The other children al&s;o eat &s;ome, but not &s;o much. When they got home they were all taken very ill. The elde&s;t boy, who had eat mo&s;t, died in great agony. The others recovered, after &s;uffering a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any way of preventing their bad effects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The be&s;t way is to clear the &s;to|mach as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible by a &s;trong vomit and large draughts of warm wa|ter. After that, vinegar is u&s;eful in removing the di&s;order of the head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are the roots &s;weet or plea&s;ant, that people &s;hould be tempted to eat them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several of them are. There is a &s;mall plant of the tribe, the root of which is much &s;ought after by boys, who dig for it with their knives. It is round, and called earth-nut, or pig|nut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is not poi&s;on, I &s;up|po&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="80" REF="85">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but it is not very whole&s;ome. I believe, however, that the roots of the mo&s;t poi&s;onous become innocent by boiling. I have heard that boiled hemlock roots are as good as carrots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I &s;hould not like to eat them, however. But pray why &s;hould there be any poi&s;ons at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>What we call poi&s;ons are only hurtful to particular animals. They are the proper food of others, and no doubt do more good than hurt in the creation. Mo&s;t of the things that are poi&s;onous to us in large quantities, are u&s;eful medicines in &s;mall ones; and we have rea&s;on be&s;towed upon <HI>us,</HI> to guard us again&s;t mi&s;chief. Other animals in general refu&s;e by in&s;tinct what would prove hurtful to them. You &s;ee beneath yonder hedge a great crop of tall flouri&s;hing plants with white flowers. They are of the umbelliferous family, and are called wild Cicely or Cowweed. The latter name is given
<PB N="81" REF="86">
them, becau&s;e the cows will not touch them, though the pa&s;ture be ever &s;o bare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would they poi&s;on them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they would; at lea&s;t they are not proper food for them. We will go and examine them, and I will &s;how you how they differ from hem|lock, for which they are &s;ometimes mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to get &s;ome of the&s;e plants and dry them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall, and write down the names of them all, and learn to know the innocent from the hurtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be very u&s;eful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will. Remember now the gene|ral character of the umbelliferous cla&s;s. The flower-&s;talks are divided into &s;pokes or umbels, which are again divided into others, each of them ter|minated by a &s;mall five-leaved flower, having five chives and two pi&s;tils, &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="82" REF="87">
by a twin &s;eed. Their leaves are generally finely divided. You will &s;oon know them after having examined two or three of the tribe. Remember, too, that they are a <HI>&s;u&s;picious race,</HI> and not to be made free with till you are well acquainted with them.</P>

<HEAD>THE KID.</HEAD>
<P>ONE bleak day in March, <HI>Sylvia</HI> returning from a vi&s;it to the &s;heep-fold, met with a young kidling de&s;erted by its dam on the naked heath. It was bleat|ing piteou&s;ly, and was &s;o benumbed with the cold, that it could &s;carcely &s;tand. <HI>Sylvia</HI> took it up in her arms and pre&s;&s;ed it clo&s;e to her bo&s;om. She ha&s;tened home, and &s;howing her little foundling to her parents, begged &s;he might rear it for her own. They con|&s;ented;
<PB N="83" REF="88">
and <HI>Sylvia</HI> immediately got a ba&s;ket full of clean &s;traw, and made a bed for him on the hearth. She warm|ed &s;ome milk, and held it to him in a platter. The poor creature drank it up eagerly, and then licked her hand for more. <HI>Sylvia</HI> was delighted. She chafed his &s;lender legs with her warm hands, and &s;oon &s;aw him jump out of his ba&s;ket, and fri&s;k acro&s;s the room. When full, he lay down again and took a comfortable nap.</P>
<P>The next day the kid had a name be|&s;towed upon him. As he gave tokens of being an excellent jumper, it was <HI>Capriole.</HI> He was introduced to all the re&s;t of the family, and the younger children were allowed to &s;troke and pat him; but <HI>Sylvia</HI> would let nobody be intimate with him but her&s;elf. The great ma&s;tiff was charged never to hurt him, and indeed he had no intention to do it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89">
Within a few days, <HI>Capriole</HI> fol|lowed <HI>Sylvia</HI> all about the hou&s;e; trotted by her &s;ide into the yard; ran races with her in the home field; fed out of her hand; and was a declared pet and fa|vourite. As the &s;pring advanced, <HI>Sylvia</HI> roamed in the fields and gathered wild flowers, with which &s;he wove garlands, and hung them around her kid's neck. He could not be kept, however, from munching his finery when he could reach it with his mouth. He was like|wi&s;e rather trouble&s;ome in thru&s;ting his no&s;e into the meal-tub and flour-box, and following people into the dairy, and &s;ipping the milk that was &s;et for cream. He now and then got a blow for his intru&s;ion, but his mi&s;tre&s;s always took his part, and indulged him in every liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Capriole</HI>'s horns now began to bud, and a little white beard &s;prouted at the end of his chin. He grew bold enough to put him&s;elf in a fighting po&s;|ture
<PB N="85" REF="90">
whenever he was offended. He butted down little <HI>Colin</HI> into the dirt; quarreled with the gee&s;e for their allow|ance of corn; and held many a &s;tout battle with the old turkey-cock. Every body &s;aid, <HI>Capriole</HI> is growing too &s;aucy, he mu&s;t be &s;ent away, or taught better manners. But <HI>Sylvia</HI> &s;till &s;tood his friend, and he repaid her love with many tender care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The farm-hou&s;e where <HI>Sylvia</HI> lived was &s;ituated in a &s;weet valley, by the &s;ide of a clear &s;tream, bordered with trees. Above the hou&s;e ro&s;e a &s;loping meadow, and beyond that was an open common, covered with purple heath and yellow furze. Further on, at &s;ome di&s;tance, ro&s;e a &s;teep hill, the &s;ummit of which was a bare craggy rock, &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible to human feet. <HI>Capriole,</HI> ranging at his plea&s;ure, often got upon the common, and was plea&s;ed with browzing the &s;hort gra&s;s and wild herbs which grew there. Still, however,
<PB N="86" REF="91">
when his mi&s;tre&s;s came to &s;eek him, he would run bounding at her call, and ac|company her back to the farm.</P>
<P>One fine &s;ummer's day, <HI>Sylvia,</HI> after having fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the morn|ing, wanted to play with her kid; and mi&s;&s;ing him, &s;he went to the &s;ide of the common, and called aloud <HI>Capriole! Capriole!</HI> expecting to &s;ee him come running to her as u&s;ual. No <HI>Capriole</HI> came. She went on and on, &s;till call|ing her kid with the mo&s;t endearing ac|cents, but nothing was to be &s;een of him. Her heart began to flutter. What can be become of him? Surely &s;omebody mu&s;t have &s;tolen him,&mdash;or perhaps the neighbour's dogs have worried him. Oh my poor <HI>Capriole!</HI> my dear <HI>Capriole!</HI> I &s;hall never &s;ee you again!&mdash;and <HI>Sylvia</HI> began to weep.</P>
<P>She &s;till went on, on, looking wi&s;t|fully all around, and making the place echo with <HI>Capriole, Capriole!</HI> where are you my <HI>Capriole?</HI> till at length &s;he
<PB N="87" REF="92">
came to the foot of the &s;teep hill. She climbed up its &s;ides to get a better view. No kid was to be &s;een. She &s;at down, and wept, and wrung her hands. After a while, &s;he fancied &s;he heard a bleat|ing like the well-known voice of her <HI>Capriole.</HI> She &s;tarted up, and looked towards the &s;ound, which &s;eemed a great way over head. At length &s;he &s;pied, ju&s;t on the edge of a &s;teep crag, her <HI>Capriole</HI> peeping over. She &s;tretch|ed out her hands to him, and began to call, but with a timid voice, le&s;t in his impatience to return to her, he &s;hould leap down and break his neck. But there was no &s;uch danger. <HI>Capriole</HI> was in|haling the fre&s;h breeze of the mountains, and enjoying with rapture the &s;cenes for which nature de&s;igned him. His bleating was the expre&s;&s;ion of joy, and he be&s;towed not a thought on his kind mi&s;tre&s;s, nor paid the lea&s;t attention to her call. <HI>Sylvia</HI> a&s;cended as high as &s;he could towards him, and called louder

<HEAD>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Robinet,</HI> a pea&s;ant of Lorrain, after a hard day's work at the next market|town, was returning home with a ba&s;ket in his hand. What a delicious &s;upper &s;hall I have! (&s;aid he to him&s;elf.) This piece of kid well &s;tewed down, with my onions &s;liced, thickened with my meal, and &s;ea&s;oned with my &s;alt and pepper, will make a di&s;h fit for the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. Then I have a good piece of a barley loaf at home to fini&s;h with. How I long to be at it!</P>
<P>A noi&s;e in the hedge now attracted his notice, and he &s;pied a &s;quirrel nim|bly
<PB N="90" REF="95">
running up a tree, and popping into a hole between the branches. Ha! (thought he) what a nice pre&s;ent a ne&s;t of young &s;quirrels will be to my little ma&s;ter! I'll try if I can get it. Upon this, he &s;et down his ba&s;ket in the road, and began to climb up the tree. He had half a&s;cended, when ca&s;ting a look at his ba&s;ket, he &s;aw a dog with his no&s;e in it, ferreting out the piece of kid's fle&s;h. He made all po&s;|&s;ible &s;peed down, but the dog was too quick for him, and ran off with the meat in his mouth. <HI>Robinet</HI> looked after him&mdash;Well, (&s;aid he) then I mu&s;t be content with &s;oup-meagre&mdash;and no bad thing neither!</P>
<P>He travelled on, and came to a little public hou&s;e by the road &s;ide, where an acquaintance of his was &s;itting on a bench drinking. He invited <HI>Ro|binet</HI> to take a draught. <HI>Robinet</HI> &s;eated him&s;elf by his friend, and &s;et his ba&s;ket on the bench clo&s;e by him. A tame
<PB N="91" REF="96">
raven, which was kept at the hou&s;e, came &s;lily behind him, and perching on the ba&s;ket, &s;tole away the bag in which the meal was tied up, and hopped off with it to his hole. <HI>Robinet</HI> did not per|ceive the theft till he had got on his way again. He returned to &s;earch for his bag, but could hear no tidings of it. Well, (&s;ays he) my &s;oup will be the thinner, but I will boil a &s;lice of bread with it, and that will do it &s;ome good at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>He went on again, and arrived at a little brook, over which was laid a nar|row plank. A young woman coming up to pa&s;s at the &s;ame time, <HI>Robinet</HI> gal|lantly offered her his hand. As &s;oon as &s;he was got to the middle, either through fear or &s;port, &s;he &s;hrieked out, and cried &s;he was falling. <HI>Robinet</HI> ha&s;t|ening to &s;upport her with his other hand, let his ba&s;ket drop into the &s;tream. As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;afe over, he jumped in and recovered it, but when he took it
<PB N="92" REF="97">
out, he perceived that all the &s;alt was melted, and the pepper wa&s;hed away. Nothing was now left but the onions. Well! (&s;ays <HI>Robinet</HI>) then I mu&s;t &s;up to-night upon roa&s;ted onions and barley bread. La&s;t night I had the bread alone. To-morrow morning it will not &s;ignify what I had.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, Sir. The lane leading to the heath, you know, is clo&s;e and &s;andy, &s;o I did not mind it much, but made the be&s;t of my way. However, I &s;pied a curious thing enough in the hedge. It was an old crab-tree, out of which grew a great bunch of &s;omething green, quite different from the tree it|&s;elf. Here is a branch of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! this is Mi&s;&s;eltoe, a plant of great fame for the u&s;e made of it by the Druids of old in their re|ligious rites and incantations. It bears a very &s;limy white berry, of which bird|lime may be made, whence its Latin name of <HI>Vi&s;cus.</HI> It is one of tho&s;e plants
<PB N="96" REF="101">
which do not grow in the ground by a root of their own, but fix them&s;elves upon other plants; whence they have been humorou&s;ly &s;tyled <HI>para&s;itical,</HI> as being hangers-on, or dependants. It was the mi&s;&s;eltoe of the oak that the Druids particularly honoured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little further on I &s;aw a green woodpecker fly to a tree, and run up the trunk like a cat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That was to &s;eek for in&s;ects in the bark, on which they live. They bore holes with their &s;trong bills for that purpo&s;e, and do much damage to the trees by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>What beautiful birds they are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; they have been called, from their colour and &s;ize, the Engli&s;h parrot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I got upon the open heath, how charming it was! The air &s;eemed &s;o fre&s;h, and the pro&s;pect on every &s;ide &s;o free and unbounded! Then it was all covered with gay flowers,
<PB N="97" REF="102">
many of which I had never ob&s;erved before. There were at lea&s;t three kinds of heath (I have got them in my hand|kerchief here), and gor&s;e, and broom, and bell-flower, and many others of all colours, that I will beg you pre&s;ently to tell me the names of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I will, readily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw, too, &s;everal birds that were new to me. There was a pretty greyi&s;h one, of the &s;ize of a lark, that was hopping about &s;ome great &s;tones; and when he flew, he &s;howed a great deal of white above his tail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That was a wheat-ear. They are reckoned very delicious birds to eat, and frequent the open downs in Su&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome other counties, in great num|bers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a flock of lapwings upon a mar&s;hy part of the heath, that amu&s;ed me much. As I came near them, &s;ome of them kept flying round and round ju&s;t over my head, and crying
<PB N="98" REF="103">
<HI>pewit</HI> &s;o di&s;tinctly, one might almo&s;t fancy they &s;poke. I thought I &s;hould have caught one of them, for he flew as if one of his wings was broken, and often tumbled clo&s;e to the ground; but as I came near, he always made a &s;hift to get away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! you were finely taken in, then! This was all an artifice of the bird's to entice you away from its ne&s;t: for they build upon the bare ground, and their ne&s;ts would ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved, did not they draw off the at|tention of intruders by their loud cries and counterfeit lamene&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h I had known that, for he led me a long cha&s;e, often over &s;hoes in water. However, it was the cau&s;e of my falling in with an old man and a boy who were cutting and piling up turf for fewel, and I had a good deal of talk with them about the manner of prepar|ing the turf, and the price it &s;ells at. They gave me, too, a creature I never
<PB N="99" REF="104">
&s;aw before&mdash;a young viper, which they had ju&s;t killed, together with its dam. I have &s;een &s;everal common &s;nakes, but this is thicker in proportion, and of a darker colour than they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True. Vipers frequent tho&s;e turfy boggy grounds pretty much, and I have known &s;everal turf-cutters bitten by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are very venomous, are they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Enough &s;o to make their wounds painful and dangerous, though they &s;eldom prove fatal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;I then took my cour&s;e up to the windmill on the mount. I climbed up the &s;teps of the mill in or|der to get a better view of the country round. What an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect! I counted fifteen church &s;teeples; and I &s;aw &s;everal gentlemen's hou&s;es peep|ing out from the mid&s;t of green woods and plantations; and I could trace the windings of the river all along the low
<PB N="100" REF="105">

<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will go again, and take with me Carey's county map, by which I &s;hall probably be able to make out mo&s;t of the places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall have it, and I will go with you, and take my pocket &s;py|ing gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be very glad of that. Well&mdash;a thought &s;truck me, that as the hill is called <HI>Camp-mount,</HI> there might probably be &s;ome remains of ditches and mounds with which I have read that camps were &s;urrounded. And I really believe I di&s;covered &s;omething of that &s;ort running round one &s;ide of the mount.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely you might. I know antiquaries have de&s;cribed &s;uch remains as exi&s;ting there, which &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e to be Roman, others Dani&s;h.
<PB N="101" REF="106">
We will examine them further when we go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the hill I went &s;traight down to the meadows below, and walk|ed on the &s;ide of a brook that runs into the river. It was all bordered with reeds and flags and tall flowering plants, quite different from tho&s;e I had &s;een on the heath. As I was getting down the bank to reach one of them, I heard &s;omething plunge into the water near me. It was a large water-rat, and I &s;aw it &s;wim over to the other &s;ide, and go into its hole. There were a great many large dragon-flies all about the &s;tream. I caught one of the fine&s;t, and have got him here in a leaf. But how I longed to catch a bird that I &s;aw hovering over the water, and every now and then darting down into it! It was all over a mixture of the mo&s;t beautiful green and blue with &s;ome orange colour. It was &s;omewhat le&s;s than a thru&s;h,
<PB N="102" REF="107">
and had a large head and bill, and a &s;hort tail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you what that bird was&mdash;a kingfi&s;her, the celebrated hal|cyon of the ancients, about which &s;o many tales are told. It lives on fi&s;h, which it catches in the manner you &s;aw. It builds in holes in the banks, and is a &s;hy retired bird, never to be &s;een far from the &s;tream where it inhabits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t try to get another &s;ight of him, for I never &s;aw a bird that plea&s;ed me &s;o much. Well&mdash;I followed this little brook till it entered the river, and then took the path that runs along the bank. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide I ob&s;erved &s;everal little birds running along the &s;hore, and making a piping noi&s;e. They were brown and white, and about as big as a &s;nipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e they were &s;and|pipers, one of the numerous family of birds that get their living by wading
<PB N="103" REF="108">
among the &s;hallows, and picking up worms and in&s;ects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were a great many &s;wal|lows, too, &s;porting upon the &s;urface of the water, that entertained me with their motions. Sometimes they da&s;hed into the &s;tream; &s;ometimes they pur&s;ued one another &s;o quick, that the eye could &s;carcely follow them. In one place, where a high &s;teep &s;and-bank ro&s;e di|rectly above the river, I ob&s;erved many of them go in and out of holes with which the bank was bored full.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e were &s;and-martins, the &s;malle&s;t of our four &s;pecies of &s;wal|lows. They are of a mou&s;e-colour above, and white beneath. They make their ne&s;ts and bring up their young in the&s;e holes, which run a great depth, and by their &s;ituation are &s;ecure from all plunderers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little further I &s;aw a man in a boat who was catching eels in an odd way. He had a long pole with
<PB N="104" REF="109">
broad iron prongs at the end, ju&s;t like Neptune's trident, only there were five in&s;tead of three. This he pu&s;hed &s;traight down among the mud in the deepe&s;t parts of the river, and fetched up the eels &s;ticking between the prongs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een this method. It is called &s;pearing of eels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>While I was looking at him, a heron came flying over my head, with his large flagging wings. He lit at the next turn of the river, and I crept &s;oftly behind the bank to watch his motions. He had waded into the water as far as his long legs would carry him, and was &s;tanding with his neck drawn in, look|ing intently on the &s;tream. Pre&s;ently he darted his long bill as quick as lightning into the water, and drew out a fi&s;h, which he &s;wallowed. I &s;aw him catch another in the &s;ame manner. He then took alarm at &s;ome noi&s;e I made, and flew away &s;lowly to a wood at &s;ome di&s;|tance, where he &s;ettled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="105" REF="110">
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Probably his ne&s;t was there, for herons build upon the loftie&s;t trees they can find, and &s;ometimes in &s;ociety together, like rooks. Formerly, when the&s;e birds were valued for the amu&s;e|ment of hawking, many gentlemen had their <HI>heronries,</HI> and a few are &s;till remaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think they are the large&s;t wild birds we have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They are of a great length and &s;pread of wing, but their bodies are comparatively &s;mall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I then turned homeward acro&s;s the meadows, where I &s;topt awhile to look at a large flock of &s;tarlings which kept flying about at no great di&s;tance. I could not tell at fir&s;t what to make of them; for they ro&s;e all together from the ground as thick as a &s;warm of bees, and formed them&s;elves into a kind of black cloud hovering over the field. After taking a &s;hort round, they &s;ettled again, and pre&s;ently ro&s;e again
<PB N="106" REF="111">
in the &s;ame manner. I dare &s;ay there were hundreds of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;o; for in the fenny countries their flocks are &s;o numerous, as to break down whole acres of reeds by &s;ettling on them. This di&s;po&s;ition of &s;tarlings to fly in clo&s;e &s;warms was remarked even by Homer, who compares the foe flying from one of his heroes, to a <HI>cloud</HI> of &s;tares retiring di&s;|mayed at the approach of the hawk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>After I had left the meadows, I cro&s;&s;ed the corn fields in the way to our hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by a deep marle pit. Looking into it, I &s;aw in one of the &s;ides a clu&s;ter of what I took to be &s;hells; and upon going down, I picked up a clod of marle, which was quite full of them; but how &s;ea &s;hells could get there, I cannot imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not wonder at your &s;urpri&s;e, &s;ince many philo&s;ophers have been much perplexed to account for the &s;ame appearance. It is not uncommon
<PB N="107" REF="112">
to find great quantities of &s;hells and re|lics of marine animals even in the bow|els of high mountains, very remote from the &s;ea. They are certainly proofs that the earth was once in a very different &s;tate from what it is at pre&s;ent; but in what manner and how long ago the&s;e changes took place, can only be gue&s;&s;|ed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I got to the high field next our hou&s;e ju&s;t as the &s;un was &s;etting, and I &s;tood looking at it till it was quite lo&s;t. What a glorious &s;ight! The clouds were tinged purple and crim&s;on and yellow of all &s;hades and hues, and the clear &s;ky varied from blue to a fine green at the horizon. But how large the &s;un ap|pears ju&s;t as it &s;ets! I think it &s;eems twice as big as when it is over head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why not?</P>

<P>That would have been right if you had been &s;ent of a me&s;&s;age; but as you only walked for amu&s;ement, it would have been wi&s;er to have &s;ought out as many &s;ources of it as po&s;&s;ible. But &s;o it is&mdash;one man walks through the world

<P>O yes&mdash;It was becau&s;e the ground drew them to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. That is a con&s;equence of the univer&s;al law in nature, that bodies attract each other in proportion to their bulk. So, a very &s;mall thing in the neighhourhood of a very large one, always tends to go to it, if not pre|vented by &s;ome other power. Well&mdash;You know I told you that the &s;un was a ball a va&s;t many times bigger than the ball we inhabit, called the earth; upon which you properly a&s;ked, how then it
<PB N="111" REF="116">
happened that the earth did not fall into the &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why does it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am going to explain to you. You have &s;een your brother whirl round an ivory ball tied to the end of a &s;tring which he held in his hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;And I have done it my&s;elf, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then&mdash;you felt that the ball was continually pulling, as if it tried to make its e&s;cape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and one my brother was &s;winging <HI>did</HI> make its e&s;cape, and flew through the &s;a&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did &s;o. That was a le&s;&s;on in the <HI>centrifugal</HI> motion, or that power by which a body thus whirled continually endeavours to fly off from the centre round which it moves. This is owing to the force or impul&s;e you give it at &s;etting out, as if you were going to throw it away from you. The &s;tring
<PB N="112" REF="117">
by which you hold it, on the contrary, is the power which keeps the ball to|wards the centre, called the <HI>centripetal</HI> power. Thus you &s;ee there are two powers acting upon the ball at the &s;ame time; one to make it fly off, the other to hold it in; and the con&s;equence is, that it moves directly according to neither, but between both; that is, round and round. This it continues to do while you &s;wing it properly; but if the &s;tring breaks or &s;lips off, away flies the ball; on the other hand, if you cea&s;e to give it the whirling force, it falls towards your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give you another in&s;tance of this double force acting at the &s;ame time. Do not you remember &s;eeing &s;ome curious feats of hor&s;eman&s;hip?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of them was, that a man &s;tanding with one leg upon the &s;addle and riding full &s;peed, threw up balls
<PB N="113" REF="118">
into the air, and catched them as they fell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you would have expected the&s;e balls to have fallen behind him, as he was going at &s;uch a rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;aw that they fell into his hand as directly as if he had been &s;tanding quite &s;till. That was becau&s;e at the in&s;tant he threw them up, they received the motion of the hor&s;e &s;traight forwards, as well as the upright mo|tion that he gave them, &s;o that they made a &s;lanting line through the air, and came down in the &s;ame place they would have reached if he had held them in his hand all the while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very curious, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, you may have ob&s;erved, in riding in a carriage, that if you throw any thing out of the window, it falls directly oppo&s;ite, ju&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="119">
as if the carriage was &s;tanding &s;till, and is not left behind you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try that, the next time I ride in one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are then to imagine the &s;un to be a mighty ma&s;s of matter, many thou&s;and times bigger than our earth, placed in the centre, quiet and unmoved. You are to conceive our earth, as &s;oon as created, launched with va&s;t force in a &s;traight line, as if it were a bowl on a green. It would have flown off in this line for ever, through the boundle&s;s regions of &s;pace, had it not at the &s;ame in&s;tant received a pull from the &s;un by its attraction. By the wonder|ful &s;kill of the Creator, the&s;e two forces were made exactly to counterbalance each other; &s;o that ju&s;t as much as the earth from the original motion given it tends to fly forwards, ju&s;t &s;o much the &s;un draws it to the centre; and the con&s;equence is, that it takes a cour&s;e
<PB N="115" REF="120">
between the two, which is a circle round and round the &s;un.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if the earth was &s;et a rolling like a bowl upon a green, I &s;hould think it would &s;top of it&s;elf, as the bowl does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bowl &s;tops becau&s;e it is continually rubbing again&s;t the ground, which checks its motion; but the ball of the earth moves in empty &s;pace, where there is nothing to &s;top it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I throw a ball through the air, it will not go on for ever, but it will come down to the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is becau&s;e the force with which you can throw it, is much le&s;s than the force by which it is drawn to the earth. But there is another rea&s;on too, which is the re&s;i&s;tance of the air. This &s;pace all around us and over us is not empty &s;pace; it is quite full of a thin tran&s;|parent fluid called air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="116" REF="121">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. If you move your hand quickly through it, you will find &s;ome|thing re&s;i&s;ting you, though in a &s;light degree. And the wind, you well know, is capable of pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t any thing with almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible force; and yet wind is nothing but a quantity of air put into violent motion. Every thing then that moves through the air, is continually obliged to pu&s;h &s;ome of this fluid out of the way, by which means it is con|&s;tantly lo&s;ing part of its motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the earth would do the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; for it moves in <HI>empty &s;pace.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! does not it move through the air?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The earth does not move <HI>through</HI> the air, but carries the air along with it. All the air is contained in what is called the <HI>atmo&s;phere,</HI> which you may com|pare to a kind of mi&s;t or fog clinging all round to the ball of the earth, and
<PB N="117" REF="122">
reaching to a certain di&s;tance above it, which has been calculated at about forty|five miles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is above the clouds, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; all the clouds are within the atmo&s;phere, for they are &s;upported by the air. Well&mdash;this atmo&s;phere rolls about along with the earth, as if it were a part of it; and moves with it through the &s;ky, which is a va&s;t field of empty &s;pace. In this immen&s;e &s;pace are all the &s;tars and planets, which have al&s;o their &s;everal motions. There is no|thing to &s;top them, but they continually go on, by means of the force that the Creator has originally impre&s;&s;ed upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not &s;ome of the &s;tars move round the &s;un, as well as our earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; tho&s;e that are called <HI>planets.</HI> The&s;e are all &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws of motion with our earth. They are attracted by the &s;un as their centre, and form, along with the earth, that a&s;&s;em|blage
<PB N="118" REF="123">
of worlds, which is called the <HI>&s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the moon one of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moon is called a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> planet, becau&s;e its immediate connexion is with our earth, round which it rolls, as we do round the &s;un. It however accompanies our earth in its journey round the &s;un. But I will tell you more about its motion, and about the other planets and &s;tars, another time. It is enough at pre&s;ent, if you thoroughly under&s;tand what I have been de|&s;cribing.</P>

<HEAD>DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT; OR, SUNDAY MORNING.</HEAD>
<P>IT was Sunday morning. All the bells were ringing for church, and the &s;treets were filled with people moving in all directions.</P>
<P>Here, numbers of well-dre&s;&s;ed per|&s;ons, and a long train of charity chil|dren, were thronging in at the wide doors of a large hand&s;ome church. There, a &s;maller number, almo&s;t equally gay in dre&s;s, were entering an elegant meeting-hou&s;e. Up one alley, a Roman Catholic congregation was turning into their retired chapel, every one cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with a finger dipt in holy-water as he went in. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet was covered with a train of quakers, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their plain and
<PB N="120" REF="125">
neat attire, and &s;edate a&s;pect, who walk|ed without ceremony into a room as plain as them&s;elves, and took their &s;eats, the men on one &s;ide and the women on the other, in &s;ilence. A &s;pacious building was filled with an overflowing crowd of Methodi&s;ts, mo&s;t of them meanly ha|bited, but decent and &s;erious in de|meanour; while a &s;mall &s;ociety of Bap|ti&s;ts in the neighbourhood quietly occu|pied their humble place of a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the different &s;ervices be|gan. The churches re&s;ounded with the &s;olemn organ, and with the indi&s;tinct murmurs of a large body of people following the mini&s;ter in re&s;pon&s;ive pray|ers. From the meetings were heard the &s;low p&s;alm, and the &s;ingle voice of the leader of their devotions. The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by &s;trains of mu&s;ic, the tinkling of a &s;mall bell, and a perpetual change of &s;ervice and ceremonial. A profound &s;ilence and unvarying look and po&s;ture
<PB N="121" REF="126">
announced the &s;elf-recollection and mental devotion of the Quakers.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> led his &s;on <HI>Edwin</HI> round all the&s;e different a&s;&s;emblies as a &s;pec|tator. <HI>Edwin</HI> viewed every thing with great attention, and was often impa|tient to inquire of his father the mean|ing of what he &s;aw; but Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> would not &s;uffer him to di&s;turb any of the congregations even by a whi&s;per. When they had gone through the whole, <HI>Edwin</HI> found a great number of que&s;tions to put to his father, who explained every thing to him in the be&s;t manner he could. At length &s;ays <HI>Edwin,</HI></P>
<P>But why cannot all the&s;e people agree to go to the &s;ame place, and wor&s;hip God the &s;ame way?</P>
<P>And why &s;hould they agree? (re|plied his father.) Do not you &s;ee that people differ in a hundred other things? Do they all dre&s;s alike, and eat and drink alike, and keep the &s;ame hours, and u&s;e the &s;ame diver&s;ions?</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="127">
Ay&mdash;but tho&s;e are things in which they have a right to do as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>And they have a right, too, to wor&s;hip God as they plea&s;e. It is their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and concerns none but them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>But has not God ordered particular ways of wor&s;hipping him?</P>
<P>He has directed the mind and &s;pirit with which he is to be wor&s;hipped, but not the particular form and manner. That is left for every one to choo&s;e, ac|cording as &s;uits his temper and opinions. All the&s;e people like their own way be&s;t, and why &s;hould they leave it for the choice of another? Religion is one of the things in which <HI>mankind were made to differ.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal congregations now began to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the &s;treet was again over&s;pread with per&s;ons of all the dif|ferent &s;ects, going promi&s;cuou&s;ly to their re&s;pective homes. It chanced that a poor man fell down in the &s;treet
<PB N="123" REF="128">
in a fit of apoplexy, and lay for dead. His wife and children &s;tood round him crying and lamenting in the bittere&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. The beholders immediately flocked round, and, with looks and ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, gave their help. A Churchman rai&s;ed the man from the ground by lifting him under the arms, while a Di&s;&s;enter held his head and wiped his face with his handkerchief. A Roman Catholic lady took out her &s;melling bottle, and a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly applied it to his no&s;e. A Me|thodi&s;t ran for a doctor. A Quaker &s;upported and comforted the woman, and a Bapti&s;t took care of the children.</P>
<P><HI>Edwin</HI> and his father were among the &s;pectators. Here (&s;aid Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>) is a thing in which <HI>mankind were made to agree.</HI></P>

<P>Very well. You know <HI>copper,</HI> I don't doubt.</P>

<P>O yes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>What colour do you call it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is a &s;ort of reddi&s;h brown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Sometimes, however, it is of a bright red, like &s;ealing wax. It is not a very heavy metal, being not quite nine times the weight of water. It is pretty ductile, bearing to be rolled or hammered out to a very thin plate, and al&s;o to be drawn out to a fine wire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember &s;eeing a halfpenny that had been rolled out to a long ribbon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I have &s;een half a dozen men at a time with great hammers beat|ing out a piece of copper at the bra|zier's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Copper requires a very con&s;ider|able heat to melt it; and by long ex|po&s;ure to the fire, it may be burned
<PB N="126" REF="131">
or calcined; for it, like all we are now to &s;peak of, is an <HI>imperfect</HI> metal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it ru&s;ts very ea&s;ily, does it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does; for all acids di&s;&s;olve or corrode it, &s;o do &s;alts of every kind; whence even air and common water in a &s;hort time act upon it, for they are never free from &s;omewhat of a &s;aline nature.</P>

<P>They are all &s;o in &s;ome degree, producing violent &s;ickne&s;s and pain in the bowels. They are all, too, ex|tremely nau&s;eous to the ta&s;te; and the metal it&s;elf, when heated, ta&s;tes and &s;mells very di&s;agreeably.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="127" REF="132">
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why is it u&s;ed, then, &s;o much in cooking, and brewing, and the like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e it is a very convenient metal for making ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially large ones, as it is ea&s;ily worked, and is &s;ufficiently &s;trong though hammered thin, and bears the fire well. And if ve&s;&s;els of it are kept quite clean, and the liquor not &s;uffered to &s;tand long in them when cold, there is no danger in their u&s;e. But copper ve&s;&s;els for cook|ing are generally lined on the in&s;ide with tin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What el&s;e is copper u&s;ed for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>A variety of things. Sheets of copper are &s;ometimes u&s;ed to cover buildings; and of late a great quantity is con&s;umed in &s;heathing &s;hips, that is, in covering all the part under water; the purpo&s;e of which is to protect the timber from the worms, and al&s;o to make the &s;hip &s;ail fa&s;ter, by means of the greater &s;moothne&s;s and force with
<PB N="128" REF="133">
which the copper makes way through the water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money is made of copper, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; for it takes an impre&s;&s;ion in coining very well, and its value is a proper proportion below &s;ilver for a a price for the cheape&s;t &s;ort of commo|dities. In &s;ome poor countries they have little other than copper coin. Another great u&s;e of copper is as an ingredient in mixed metals, &s;uch as bell|metal, cannon-metal, and particularly bra&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But bra&s;s is yellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; it is converted to that co|lour by means of another metallic &s;ub|&s;tance named <HI>zinc,</HI> or <HI>&s;pelter,</HI> the natu|ral colour of which is white. A kind of brown &s;tone called <HI>calamine</HI> is an ore of zinc. By filling a pot with layers of powdered calamine and charcoal placed alternately with copper, and ap|plying a pretty &s;trong heat, the zinc is driven in vapour out of the calamine,
<PB N="129" REF="134">
and penetrates the copper, changing it into bra&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the u&s;e of turning copper into bra&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It gains a fine gold-like colour, and becomes harder, more ea&s;y to melt, and le&s;s liable to ru&s;t. Hence it is pre|ferred for a variety of uten&s;ils, orna|mental and u&s;eful. Bra&s;s does not bear hammering well, but is generally ca&s;t into the &s;hape wanted, and then turned in a lathe and poli&s;hed. Well&mdash;the&s;e are the principal things I have to &s;ay about copper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where does it come from?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Copper is found in many countries. Our i&s;land yields abundance, e&s;pecially in Wales and Cornwall. In Angle&s;ey is a whole hill called Paris-moun|tain, con&s;i&s;ting of copper ore, from which immen&s;e quantities are dug every year. Now for <HI>iron.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! that is the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all the metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="130" REF="135">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is; and it is likewi&s;e the mo&s;t common, for there are few countries in the world po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing hills and rocks where it is not met with, more or le&s;s. Iron is the harde&s;t of metals, the mo&s;t ela&s;tic or &s;pringy, the mo&s;t tena|cious or difficult to break, next to gold, the mo&s;t difficultly fu&s;ible, and one of the lighte&s;t, being only &s;even or eight times heavier than water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ay it is difficult to break; but I &s;napt the blade of a penknife the other day by only bending it a little; and my mother is continually breaking her needles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Properly objected! But the qua|lities of iron differ extremely according to the method of preparing it. There are forged iron, ca&s;t iron, and &s;teel, which are very different from each other. Iron when fir&s;t melted from its ore, has little malleability, and the ve&s;&s;els and other implements that are made of it in that &s;tate by ca&s;ting into moulds, are
<PB N="131" REF="136">
ea&s;ily broken. It acquires toughne&s;s and malleability by <HI>forging,</HI> which is done by beating it when red hot with heavy hammers, till it becomes ductile and flexible. Steel, again, is made by heating &s;mall bars of iron with wood|a&s;hes, charcoal, bone and horn &s;havings, or other inflammable matters, by which it acquires a finer grain and more com|pact texture, and becomes harder and more ela&s;tic. Steel may be render|ed either very flexible, or brittle, by different manners of <HI>tempering,</HI> which is performed by heating and then quenching it in water. Steel is iron in its more perfect &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>All cutting in&s;truments are made of &s;teel, are they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and the very fine edged ones are generally tempered brittle, as razors, penknives, and &s;urgeon's in&s;tru|ments; but &s;word-blades are made flex|ible, and the be&s;t of them will bend double without breaking or becoming
<PB N="132" REF="137">
crooked. The &s;teel of which &s;prings are made, have the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible de|gree of ela&s;ticity given them. A watch|&s;pring is one of the mo&s;t perfect ex|amples of this kind. Steel for or|naments is made extremely hard and clo&s;e-grained, &s;o as to bear an exqui&s;ite poli&s;h. Common hammered iron is chiefly u&s;ed for works of &s;trength, as hor&s;e-&s;hoes, bars, bolts, and the like. It will bend but not &s;traighten it&s;elf again, as you may &s;ee in the kitchen poker. Ca&s;t iron is u&s;ed for pots and cauldrons, cannons, cannon-balls, grates, pillars, and many other purpo&s;es in which hardne&s;s without flexibility is wanted.</P>

From the difficulty of melting it out of the ore, many nations have been longer in di&s;covering it than &s;ome of the other metals. The Greeks in Homer's time &s;eem to have employed copper or bra&s;s for their weapons much more than iron; and the Mexicans and Peruvians, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed gold and &s;ilver, were unac|quainted with iron when the Spaniards invaded them.</P>

<P>It is &s;o, and that is one of its wor&s;t properties. Every liquor, and even a moi&s;t air, corrodes it. But the ru&s;t of iron is not pernicious; on the contrary it is a very u&s;eful medicine.</P>

<P>Yes; iron is given in a variety of forms, and the property of them all is to &s;trengthen the con&s;titution.

that it is the only thing attracted by the magnet, or load&s;tone.</P>

<P>I had a magnet once that would take up needles and keys: but it &s;eem|ed a bar of iron it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. The real load&s;tone, which is a particular ore of iron, can com|municate its virtue to a piece of iron by rubbing it; nay, a bar of iron it&s;elf, in length of time, by being placed in a particular po&s;ition, will acquire the &s;ame property.</P>

<P>Is all the iron u&s;ed in England, produced here?</P>

<SP>

<P>By no means. Our exten&s;ive manufactures require a great importa|tion of iron. Much is brought from Norway, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden; and the Swedi&s;h is reckoned particularly ex|cellent. Well&mdash;now to another metal. I dare &s;ay you can tell <HI>me</HI> a good deal about <HI>lead.</HI></P>

<P>True; tho&s;e are &s;ome of its di&s;|tingui&s;hing properties. Its weight is between eleven and twelve times that of water. Its colour is a dull blui&s;h white; and from this livid hue, as well as its being totally void of &s;pring or ela&s;ticity, it has acquired a &s;ort of cha|racter of dulne&s;s and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s.

<P>Lead is very malleable, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it may be beat out into a pretty thin leaf, but it will not bear drawing into fine wire. It is not only very fu&s;ible, but very readily calcined by heat, changing into a powder, or a &s;ealy matter, which may be made to take all colours by the fire, from yellow to deep red.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="137" REF="142">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is calcined lead expo&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time to a &s;trong flame. Lead may even be changed into gla&s;s by a moderate heat; and there is a good deal of it in our fine&s;t gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is white lead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is lead corroded by the &s;team of vinegar. Lead in various forms is much u&s;ed by painters. Its calces di&s;&s;olve in oil, and are employed for the purpo&s;e of thickening paint and making it dry. All lead paints, however, are unwhole&s;ome as long as they continue to &s;mell, and the fumes of lead when melted are like|wi&s;e pernicious. This is the cau&s;e why painters and plumbers are &s;o &s;ubject to various di&s;ea&s;es, particularly violent co|lics, and pal&s;ies. The white-lead ma|nufacture is &s;o hurtful to the health, that the workmen in a very &s;hort time are apt to lo&s;e the u&s;e of their limbs, and be otherwi&s;e &s;everely indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, then, that anybody will work in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="138" REF="143">
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorance and high wages are &s;ufficient to induce them. But it is to be lamented that in a great many manu|factures, the health and lives of indivi|duals are &s;acrificed to the convenience and profit of the community. Lead, too, when di&s;&s;olved, as it may be, in all four liquors, is a &s;low poi&s;on, and the more dangerous, as it gives no di&s;agree|able ta&s;te. A &s;alt of lead made with vinegar is &s;o &s;weet as to be called the &s;ugar of lead. It has been too common to put this or &s;ome other preparation of lead into four wines, in order to cure them; and much mi&s;chief has been done by this practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>If lead is poi&s;onous, is it not wrong to make water-pipes and ci&s;terns of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>This has been objected to; but it does not appear that water can di&s;|&s;olve any of the lead. Nor does it rea|dily ru&s;t in the air, and hence it is much u&s;ed to cover buildings with, as well as
<PB N="139" REF="144">
to line &s;pouts and water-cour&s;es. For the&s;e purpo&s;es, the lead is ca&s;t into &s;heets, which are ea&s;ily cut and ham|mered into any &s;hape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bullets and &s;hot, too, are made of lead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>They are; and in this way it is ten times more de&s;tructive than as a poi&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think more lead &s;eems to be u&s;ed than any metal except iron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; and the plenty of it in our country is a great benefit to us, both for dome&s;tic u&s;e, and as an article that brings in much profit by exportation.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where are our principal lead-mines?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are much &s;cattered about our i&s;land. The we&s;t of England pro|duces a good deal, in Cornwall, Devon|&s;hire, and Somer&s;et&s;hire. Wales af|fords a large quantity. Derby&s;hire has long been noted for its lead-mines, and &s;o have Northumberland and Durham.
<PB N="140" REF="145">
And there are con&s;iderable ones in the &s;outhern part of Scotland. Now do you recollect another metal to be &s;poken about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Tin re&s;embles lead in colour, but has a more &s;ilvery whitene&s;s. It is &s;oft and flexible, like lead, but is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the crackling noi&s;e it makes on being bent. It melts as ea&s;ily as lead, and al&s;o is readily calcined by keeping it in the fire. It is the light|e&s;t of the metals, being only &s;even times heavier than water. Tin may be beat into a thin leaf, but not drawn out to wire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is tin of much u&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not often u&s;ed by it&s;elf, but very frequently in conjunction with other metals. As tin is little liable to ru&s;t, or to be corroded by common liquors, it is employed for a lining or coating of ve&s;&s;els made of copper or
<PB N="141" REF="146">
iron. The &s;aucepans and kettles in the kitchen, you know, are all tinned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. How is it done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>By melting the tin and &s;preading it upon the &s;urface of the copper, which is fir&s;t lightly pitched over, in order to make the tin adhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are the ve&s;&s;els made at the tinman's? Are not they all tin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. <HI>Tinned-</HI>ware (as it is pro|perly called) is made of thin iron plates coated over with tin by dipping them into a ve&s;&s;el full of melted tin. The&s;e plates are afterwards cut and bent to proper &s;hapes, and the joinings are &s;ol|dered together with a mixture of tin and other metals. Another &s;imilar u&s;e of tin is in what is called the &s;ilvering of pins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What&mdash;is not that real &s;ilver|ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The pins, which are made of bra&s;s wire, after being pointed and head|ed, are boiled in water in which grain|tin
<PB N="142" REF="147">
is put, along with tartar, which is a cru&s;t that collects on the in&s;ide of wine ca&s;ks. The tartar di&s;&s;olves &s;ome of the tin, and makes it adhere to the &s;ur|face of the pins; and thus thou&s;ands are covered in an in&s;tant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is as clever as what you told us of the gilding of buttons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. Another purpo&s;e for which great quantities of tin u&s;ed to be employed, was the making of pewter. The be&s;t pewter con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of tin, with a &s;mall mixture of other metals to harden it; and the London pewter was brought to &s;uch perfection as to look almo&s;t as well as &s;ilver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can ju&s;t remember a long row of pewter plates at my grandmother's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may. In her time all the plates and di&s;hes for the table were made of pewter; and a hand&s;ome range of pew|ter &s;helves was thought a capital orna|ment for a kitchen. At pre&s;ent this trade is almo&s;t come to nothing through
<PB N="143" REF="148">
the u&s;e of earthen ware and china; and pewter is employed for little, but &s;tills and barber's ba&s;ons, and porter pots. But a good deal is &s;till exported. Tin is likewi&s;e an ingredient in other mixed metals for various purpo&s;es, but on the whole, le&s;s of it is u&s;ed than of the other common metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not England more famous for tin than any other country? I have read of the Phoenicians trading here for it in very early times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did; and tin is &s;till a very valuable article of export from England. Much of it is &s;ent as far as China. The tin-mines here are chiefly in Corn|wall, and I believe they are the mo&s;t productive of any in Europe. Very fine tin is al&s;o got in the penin&s;ula of Malacca in the Ea&s;t Indies. Well&mdash;we have now gone through the metals.</P>

<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right enough, becau&s;e &s;words are made of iron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Then tin is <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and lead, <HI>Saturn;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e only to make out the number. Yet the dulne&s;s of lead might be thought to agree with that planet which is mo&s;t remote from
<PB N="146" REF="151">
the &s;un. The&s;e names, childi&s;h as they may &s;eem, are worth remembering, &s;ince chymi&s;ts and phy&s;icians &s;till apply them to many preparations of the various metals. You will probably often hear of <HI>martial, lunar, mercurial,</HI> and <HI>&s;aturnine;</HI> and you may now know what they mean.</P>

<P>I think the knowledge of metals &s;eems more u&s;eful than all you have told us about plants.</P>

<P>They are made to be happy.

Man &s;urpa&s;&s;es other animals in his powers of enjoyment, and he has pro&s;pects in a future &s;tate which they do not &s;hare with him.

<P>But is not that very &s;trange? If they were created to live and be happy, why &s;hould they be de&s;troyed &s;o fa&s;t?</P>

<P>They are de&s;troyed no fa&s;ter than others are produced; and if they en|joyed life while it la&s;ted, they have had a good bargain. By making animals the food of animals, providence has filled up every chink, as it were, of ex|i&s;tence. You &s;ee the&s;e &s;warms of flies. During all the hot weather they are con|tinually coming forth from the &s;tate of eggs and maggots, and as &s;oon as they get the u&s;e of wings, they roam about, and fill every place in &s;earch of food. Meantime they are giving &s;u&s;|tenance to the whole race of &s;piders; they maintain all the &s;wallow tribe, and contribute greatly to the &s;upport of many other &s;mall birds; and even afford many a delicate mor&s;el to the fi&s;hes. Their own numbers, however, &s;eem &s;carcely dimini&s;hed, and va&s;t multi|tudes live on till the cold weather comes and puts an end to them. Were no|thing to touch them, they would pro|bably become &s;o numerous as to &s;tarve

each other. As it is, they are full of enjoyment them&s;elves, and afford life and enjoyment to other creatures, which in their turn &s;upply the wants of others.</P>

<P>It is no charity, then, to tear a &s;pider's web in pieces in order to &s;et a fly at liberty.</P>

<P>None at all&mdash;no more than it would be to demoli&s;h the traps of a poor Indian hunter, who depended upon them for his dinner. They both act as nature directs them. Shall I tell you a &s;tory?</P>

<P>A venerable Bramin, who had never in his days eaten any thing but rice and milk, and held it the great|e&s;t of crimes to &s;hed the blood of any thing that had life, was one day medi|tating on the banks of the Ganges. He &s;aw a little bird on the ground pick|ing up ants as fa&s;t as he could &s;wallow. Murderous wretch, cried he, what &s;cores
<PB N="155" REF="160">
of lives are &s;acrificed to one gluttonous meal of thine! Pre&s;ently a &s;parrow|hawk pouncing down, &s;eized him in his claws, and flew off with him. The Bra|min at fir&s;t was inclined to triumph over the little bird; but on hearing his cries, he could not help pitying him. Poor thing, &s;aid he, thou art fallen into the clutches of thy tyrant! A &s;tronger ty|rant, however, took up the matter; for a falcon in mid-air darting on the &s;par|row-hawk, &s;truck him to the ground, with the bird lifele&s;s in his talon. Ty|rant again&s;t tyrant, thought the Bramin, is well enough. The falcon had not fini&s;hed tearing his prey, when a lynx, &s;tealing from behind the rock on which he was perched, &s;prung on him, and hav|ing &s;trangled him, bore him to the edge of a neighbouring thicket, and began to &s;uck his blood. The Bramin was at|tentively viewing this new di&s;play of re|tributive ju&s;tice, when a &s;udden roar &s;hook the air, and a huge tyger, ru&s;h|ing
<PB N="156" REF="161">
from the thicket, came like thunder on the lynx. The Bramin was near enough to hear the cra&s;hing bones, and was making off in great terror, when he met an Engli&s;h &s;oldier, armed with his mu&s;ket. He pointed eagerly to the place where the tyger was making his bloody repa&s;t. The &s;oldier levelled his gun, and laid the tyger dead. Brave fellow! exclaimed the Bramin. I am very hungry, &s;aid the &s;oldier, can you give me a beef-&s;teak? I &s;ee you have plenty of cows here. Horrible! cried the Bramin; what! I kill the &s;acred cows of Brama! Then kill the next tyger your&s;elf, &s;aid the &s;oldier.</P>
