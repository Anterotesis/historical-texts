<P>I THOUGHT I &s;hould find you here, my Lord: this new ta&s;te for &s;olitude is a mortal &s;ymptom in your di&s;temper. A lover &s;eldom de&s;ires better company than his own thoughts.</P>

<P>Yes&mdash;That his Lord&s;hip, in his la&s;t letter to you at Paris, propo&s;ed a match to you; your impatience to &s;ee the lady made you anticipate his orders for your return; you left Paris <HI>incognito,</HI> &s;aw the lady at Ranelagh, and&mdash;</P>

under a fictitious name, &s;ighing at the feet of a young divinity, that has vi&s;ited this &s;ublunary world in the &s;hape of an humble dependant upon a haughty lady of quality.</P>

<SP>

<P>I have no &s;ecrets that I would hide from you, my Lord. My &s;i&s;ter, whom you have often heard me mention with tenderne&s;s, though I have not &s;een her &s;ince &s;he was a child, has privately with|drawn her&s;elf from an aunt, with whom &s;he has re&s;ided &s;ince the death of her parents; and it is conjectured &s;he is gone to Paris to meet me, my la&s;t letter to her being dated from thence.</P>

<P>Her aunt had made &s;ome <HI>prudent</HI> choice of a husband for her, perhaps&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;the old lady is a bigoted Roman Catho|lick&mdash;and, having a large fortune to be&s;tow, at|tempted to make a pro&s;elyte of the poor girl, pro|mi&s;ing her, in that ca&s;e, to &s;ettle her e&s;tate upon her. This failing, &s;he laid a &s;cheme for entrapping her into a convent; which my &s;i&s;ter being informed of, fled to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who gave you this intelligence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A friend of my father's, whom I accidentally met with upon the terrace, who had &s;een me at Leyden, while I was at the univer&s;ity there, and knew me immediately. We cannot hope, you &s;ee, to be longer concealed; therefore it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, my Lord, that you &s;hould pre&s;ent your|&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to your father.&mdash;What do you re&s;olve to do, my Lord?</P>

<SP>

<P>Certainly, unle&s;s you re&s;olve to pre&s;ent your&s;elf to him immediately. My friend&s;hip for you, my Lord, has already carried me farther than it ought: I have indulged you, in coming over privately, that you might gratify your curio&s;ity with a &s;ight of the lady your father de&s;igns for you; this done, you promi&s;ed to go back with me to Paris, there to wait his expre&s;s orders for your return; but you have not kept your word.

<P>I cannot &s;ee my father; I cannot re&s;olve to marry the lady he has cho&s;en for me. Kind and indulgent as he has ever been, I have not fortitude enough to meet his frown &mdash; I will write to him when we get to Paris, and we will &s;et out to-mor|row. Now are you &s;atisfied?</P>

<L>What if I give a ma&s;querade? I will.</L>
<L>But how! ay, there's the rub!
<STAGE>(pau&s;ing)</STAGE>
I've got my cue:</L>
<L>The world's a ma&s;querade! the ma&s;quers, you, you, you.</L>
<STAGE>To Boxes, Pit, Gall.</STAGE>
<L>Lud! what a groupe the motley &s;cene di&s;clo&s;es!</L>
<L>Fal&s;e wits, fal&s;e wives, fal&s;e virgins, and fal&s;e &s;pou&s;es:</L>
<L>State&s;men with bridles on; and, clo&s;e be&s;ide 'em,</L>
<L>Patriots, in party colour'd &s;uits, that ride 'em.</L>
<L>There Hebes, turn'd of fifty, try once more,</L>
<L>To rai&s;e a flame in Cupids of three&s;core.</L>
<L>The&s;e, in their turn, with appetites as keen,</L>
<L>De&s;erting fifty, fa&s;ten on fifteen.</L>
<L>Mi&s;s, not yet full fifteen, with fire uncommon,</L>
<L>Flings down her &s;ampler, and takes up the woman:</L>
<L>The little urchin &s;miles, and &s;preads her lure,</L>
<L>And tries to kill ere &s;he's got power to cure.</L>
<L>Thus 'tis with all&mdash;Their chief and con&s;tant care</L>
<L>Is to &s;eem every thing&mdash;but what they are.</L>
<L>Yon broad, bold, angry, &s;park, I fix my eye on,</L>
<L>Who &s;eems t' have robb'd his vizor from the lion,</L>
<L>Who frowns, and talks, and &s;wears, with round parade.</L>
<L>Looking, as who &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Damme! who's afraid!</HI>
<STAGE>mimicking.</STAGE></L>
<L>Strip but his vizor off, and &s;ure I am,</L>
<L>You'll find his lion&s;hip a very lamb.</L>
<L>Yon politician, famous in debate,</L>
<L>Perhaps to vulgar eyes be&s;trides the &s;tate;</L>
<L>Yet, when he deigns his real &s;hape t' a&s;&s;ume,</L>
<L>He turns old woman, and be&s;trides a broom.</L>
<L>Yon patriot too, who pre&s;&s;es on your &s;ight,</L>
<L>And &s;eems to every gazer all in white;</L>
<L>If with a bribe his candour you attack,</L>
<L>He bows, turns round, and whip&mdash;the man's a black!</L>
<L>Yon critic too&mdash;but whither do I run?</L>
<L>If I proceed, our bard will be undone!</L>
<L>Well then, a truce, &s;ince &s;he reque&s;ts it too;</L>
<L>Do you &s;pare her, and I'll for once &s;pare you.</L>
