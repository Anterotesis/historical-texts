<P>M. <HI>l' Abb&egrave; Tera&s;&s;on</HI> (in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Iliad) en|deavours to prove that <HI>Longinus</HI> has mi&s;repre&s;ented the whole Context and Sen&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Homer.</HI> The Fact (&s;ays he) is, that <HI>Ajax</HI> is in a very different Situation in <HI>Homer</HI> from that wherein <HI>Longinus</HI> de&s;cribes him. He has not the lea&s;t Intention of fighting, he thinks only of finding out &s;ome fit Per&s;on to &s;end to <HI>Achilles;</HI> and this Darkne&s;s hindering him from &s;eeing &s;uch an one, is the occa&s;ion of his Prayer. Accordingly it appears by what follows, that as &s;oon as <HI>Ju|piter</HI> has di&s;pers'd the Cloud, <HI>Ajax</HI> never falls upon the Ene|my, but in con&s;equence of his former Thought orders <HI>Me|nelaus</HI> to look for <HI>Antilochus,</HI> to di&s;patch him to <HI>Achilles</HI> with the News of the Death of his Friend. <HI>Longinus</HI> (continues this Author) had certainly forgot the Place from whence he took this Thought; and it is not the fir&s;t Citation from <HI>Homer</HI> which the Ancients have quoted wrong. Thus <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> attributes to <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> the Words of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the twelfth Book of the Ody&s;&s;eis; and confounds together two Pa&s;&s;ages, one of the &s;econd, the other of the fifteenth Book of the Iliad. [<HI>Ethic. ad Nicom.</HI> l. 2. c. 9. and l. 3. c. 11.] And thus <HI>Cicero</HI> a&s;cribed to <HI>Agamemnon</HI> a long Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the &s;econd Iliad; [<HI>De divinatione</HI> l. 2.] and cited as <HI>Ajax</HI>'s, the Speech of <HI>Hector</HI> in the &s;eventh. [See <HI>Aul. Gellius</HI> l. 15. c. 6.] One has no cau&s;e to wonder at this, &s;ince the Ancients having <HI>Homer</HI> almo&s;t by heart, were for that very Rea&s;on the more &s;ubject to mi&s;take in citing him by Memory.</P>
<P>To this I think one may an&s;wer, that granting it was partly the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Prayer to obtain Light, in order to &s;end to <HI>Achilles</HI> (which he afterwards does) yet the Thought which <HI>Longinus</HI> attributes to him, is very con&s;i&s;tent with it; and the la&s;t Line expre&s;&s;es nothing el&s;e but an

And thus far (&s;ay they) <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks a little ob&s;curely, but afterwards he names 'em expre&s;&s;ly, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, to which, for the fourth Element, you mu&s;t add <HI>Vulcan,</HI> who makes the Shield. The extreme Circle that run round the Shield which he calls <HI>&s;plendid</HI> and <HI>threefold,</HI> is the Zodiack; three|fold for its Breadth, within which all the Planets move; &s;plendid, becau&s;e the Sun pa&s;&s;es always thro' the mid&s;t of it. The &s;ilver Handle by which the Shield is fa&s;tened at both Extremities, is the <HI>Axis</HI> of the World, imagin'd to pa&s;s thro it, and upon which it turns.

<P><HI>Heraclides Ponticus</HI> thus pur&s;ues the Allegory. <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;ays he) makes the working of his Shield, that is the World, to be begun by <HI>Night,</HI> as indeed all Matter lay undi&s;tingui&s;h'd in an original and univer&s;al <HI>Night;</HI> which is called <HI>Chaos</HI> by the Poets.</P>
<P>To bring the matter of the Shield to Separation and Form, <HI>Vulcan</HI> pre&s;ides over the Work, or as we may &s;ay, an <HI>e&s;&s;ential Warmth: All things,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Heraclitus, being made by the Operation of Fire.</HI></P>

<L>The Earth and Seas beneath, the Pole above,</L>
<L>The Sun unwearied, and the circled Moon.</L></Q> <PB N="121" REF="122">
Thus in the Beginning of the World, he fir&s;t lays the Earth as the Foundation of a Building, who&s;e Vacancies are fill'd up with the Flowings of the Sea.

Or in explaining a Painting of <HI>Raphael</HI> or <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> can we prevent animating the Figures, in making them &s;peak con|formably to the De&s;ign of the Painter?

<P>We come now to the <HI>Matter.</HI> If this Shield (&s;ays a mo|dern Critick) had been made in a wi&s;er Age, it would have been more correct and le&s;s charg'd with Objects. There are two things which cau&s;e the Cen&s;urers to fall into this fal&s;e Critici&s;m: The fir&s;t is, that they think the Shield was no broader than the brims of a Hat, whereas it was large enough
<PB N="133" REF="134">
to cover a whole Man. The other is, that they did not know the De&s;ign of the Poet, and imagined this De|&s;cription was only the Whim&s;y of an irregular Wit, who did it by chance, and not following Nature; for they ne|ver &s;o much as enter'd into the Intention of the Poet, nor knew the Shield was de&s;ign'd as a Repre&s;entation of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis happy that <HI>Virgil</HI> has made a Buckler for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as well as <HI>Homer</HI> for <HI>Achilles.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Poet, who imitated the <HI>Greek</HI> one, always took care to accommodate tho&s;e things which Time had chang'd, &s;o as to render them agreeable to the Palate of his Readers; yet he hath not only charg'd his Shield with a great deal more Work, &s;ince he paints all the Actions of the <HI>Romans</HI> from <HI>A&s;canius</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> but has not avoided any of tho&s;e manners of Expre&s;&s;ion which offend the Criticks.

<P>Thus far the Objections are an&s;wer'd by Mon&s;. <HI>Dacier.</HI> Since when, &s;ome others have been &s;tarted, as that the Objects repre&s;ented on the Buckler have no reference to the Poem, no Agreement with <HI>Thetis</HI> who procur'd it, <HI>Vul|oan</HI> who made it, or <HI>Achilles</HI> for whom it was made.</P>

<P>But &s;till the main Objection, and that in which the Va|nity of the Moderns has triumph'd the mo&s;t, is, that the Shield is crowded with &s;uch a Multiplicity of Figures, as could not po&s;&s;ibly be repre&s;ented in the Compa&s;s of it. The late Di&s;&s;ertation of Mon&s;. <HI>Boivin</HI> has put an end to this Cavil, and the Reader will have the Plea&s;ure to be con|vinced of it by ocular Demon&s;tration, in the Print annexed.</P>
<P>This Author &s;uppo&s;es the Buckler to have been perfectly round: He divides the convex Surface into four concentrick Circles.</P>
<P>The Circle next the Center contains the Globe of the Earth and the Sea, in miniature; He gives this Circle the Dimen&s;ion of three Inches.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Circle is allotted for the Heavens and the Stars: He allows the Space of ten Inches between this, and the former Circle.</P>
<P>The third &s;hall be eight Inches di&s;tant from the &s;econd. The Space between the&s;e two Circles &s;hall be divided into twelve Compartiments, each of which makes a Picture of ten or eleven Inches deep.</P>
<P>The fourth Circle makes the Margin of the Buckler: And the Interval between this and the former, being of three Inches, is &s;ufficient to repre&s;ent the Waves and Currents of the Ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
All the&s;e together make but four Foot in the whole in Diameter. The Print of the&s;e Circles and Divi&s;ions will &s;erve to prove, that the Figures will neither be crowded nor confu&s;ed, if di&s;po&s;ed in the proper Place and Order.</P>
<P>As to the Size and Figure of the Shield, it is evident from the Poets, that in the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War there were Shields of an extraordinary Magnitude. The Buckler of <HI>Ajax</HI> is often compar'd by <HI>Homer</HI> to a Tower, and in the &s;ixth Iliad that of <HI>Hector</HI> is de&s;cribed to cover him from the Shoulders to the Ankles.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L>
<BIBL>&vers;. 117.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the &s;econd Ver&s;e of the De&s;cription of this Buckler of <HI>Achilles,</HI> it is &s;aid that <HI>Vulcan</HI> ca&s;t round it a radiant Circle.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L>
<BIBL>&vers;. 479.</BIBL></Q> Which proves the Figure to have been round. But if it be alledg'd that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> as well &s;ignifies <HI>oval</HI> as <HI>circular,</HI> it may be an&s;wer'd, that the circular Figure better agrees to the Spheres repre&s;ented in the Center, and to the Cour&s;e of the Ocean at the Circumference.</P>
<P>We may very well allow four Foot Diameter to this Buck|ler: As one may &s;uppo&s;e a larger Size would have been too unwieldy, &s;o a le&s;s would not have been &s;ufficient to cover the Brea&s;t and Arm of a Man of a Stature &s;o large as <HI>A|chilles.</HI></P>
<P>In allowing four Foot Diameter to the whole each of the twelve Compartiments may be of ten or eleven Inches in Depth, which will be enough to contain, without any Confu&s;ion, all the Objects which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions. In|deed in this Print, each Compartiment being but of one Inch, the principal Figures only are repre&s;ented; but the Reader may ea&s;ily imagine the Advantage of nine or ten Inches more. However, if the Criticks are not yet &s;atisfy'd there is room enough, it is but taking in the literal Sen&s;e the Words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, with which <HI>Homer</HI> begins his

De&s;cription, and the Buckler may be &s;uppos'd engraven on both Sides, which Suppo&s;ition will double the Size of each Piece: The one &s;ide may &s;erve for the general De&s;cription of Heaven and Earth, and the other for all the Parti|culars.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been now &s;hewn, that the Shield of <HI>Homer</HI> is blamele&s;s as to its De&s;ign and Di&s;po&s;ition, and that the Subject (&s;o exten&s;ive as it is) may be contracted within the due Limits; not being one va&s;t unproportion'd Heap of Figures, but divided into twelve regular Compartiments. What remains, is to con&s;ider this Piece as a complete <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Painting,</HI> and a Sketch for what one may call an <HI>univer|&s;al Picture.</HI> This is certainly the Light in which it is chiefly to be admired, and in which alone the Criticks have neglect|ed to place it.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to believe that <HI>Homer</HI> did in this, as he has done in other Arts, (even in Mechanicks) that is, comprehend whatever was known of it in his Time; if not (as is highly probable) from thence extend his Ideas yet farther, and give a more enlarged Notion of it. Accordingly it is very ob|&s;ervable, that there is &s;carce a Species or Branch of this Art which is not here to be found, whether Hi&s;tory, Battel-Paint|ing, Landskip, Architecture, Fruits, Flowers, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think it po&s;&s;ible that Painting was arrived to a greater Degree of Perfection, even at that early Period, than is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e who have written upon it. <HI>Pliny</HI> expre&s;ly &s;ays, that it was not known in the time of the <HI>Tro|jan</HI> War. The &s;ame Author, and others, repre&s;ent it in a very imperfect State in <HI>Greece,</HI> in, or near the Days of <HI>Ho|mer.</HI> They tell us of one Painter, that he was the fir&s;t who begun to &s;hadow; and of another, that he fill'd his Outlines only with a &s;ingle Colour, and that laid on every where alike: But we may have a higher Notion of the Art, from tho&s;e De&s;criptions of Statues, Carvings, Tape&s;trys, Sculptures up|on Armour, and Ornaments of all kinds, which every where occur in our Author; as well as from what he &s;ays of their Beauty, the Relievo, and their Emulation of Life it&s;elf. If we con&s;ider how much it is his con&s;tant Practice to confine him&s;elf to the Cu&s;tom of the Times whereof he writ, it will be hard to doubt but that Painting and Sculpture mu&s;t have been then in great Practice and Repute.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
The Shield is not only de&s;crib'd as a Piece of Sculpture but of Painting; the Outlines may be &s;uppos'd engraved, and the re&s;t enamel'd, or inlaid with various-colour'd Metals. The Va|riety of Colours is plainly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> where he &s;peaks of the <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> of the new-open'd Earth, of the <HI>&s;e|veral Colours</HI> of the Grapes and Vines; and in other Places. The different Metals that <HI>Vulcan</HI> is feign'd to ca&s;t into the Furnace, were &s;ufficient to afford all the nece&s;&s;ary Colours: But if to tho&s;e which are natural to the Metals, we add al&s;o tho&s;e which they are capable of receiving from the Operation of Fire, we &s;hall find, that <HI>Vulcan</HI> had as great a Variety of Colours to make u&s;e of as any modern Paint|er. That Enamelling, or fixing Colours by Fire, was pra|cti&s;ed very anciently, may be conjectur'd from what <HI>Dio|dorus</HI> reports of one of the Walls of <HI>Babylon,</HI> built by <HI>Semi|ramis,</HI> that <HI>the Bricks of it were painted before they were burn'd, &s;o as to repre&s;ent all &s;orts of Animals.</HI> lib. 2. chap. 4. Now it is but natural to infer, that Men had made u&s;e of ordinary Colours for the Repre&s;entation of Objects, before they learnt to repre&s;ent them by &s;uch as are given by the O|peration of Fire; one being much more ea&s;y and obvious than the other, and that &s;ort of Painting by means of Fire being but an Imitation of the Painting with a Pencil and Colours. The &s;ame Inference will be farther enforc'd from the Works of Tape&s;try, which the Women of tho&s;e Times interweaved with many Colours; as appears from the De|&s;cription of that Veil which <HI>Hecuba</HI> offers to <HI>Minerva</HI> in the &s;ixth Iliad, and from a Pa&s;&s;age in the twenty &s;econd where <HI>Andromache</HI> is repre&s;ented working Flowers in a Piece of this kind. They mu&s;t certainly have known the U&s;e of the Colours them&s;elves for Painting, before they could think of dying Threads with tho&s;e Colours, and weaving tho&s;e Threads clo&s;e to one another, in order only to a more la|borious Imitation of a thing &s;o much more ea&s;ily perform'd by a Pencil. This Ob&s;ervation I owe to the <HI>Abb&egrave; Fraguier.</HI></P>
<P>It may indeed be thought, that a Genius &s;o va&s;t and com|prehen&s;ive as that of <HI>Homer</HI> might carry his Views beyond the re&s;t of Mankind, and that in this Buckler of <HI>Achilles</HI> he rather de&s;ign'd to give a Scheme of what might be per|form'd,
<PB N="140" REF="141">
than a De&s;cription of what really was &s;o: And &s;ince he made a God the Arti&s;t, he might excu&s;e him&s;elf from a &s;trict Confinement to what was known and practi&s;ed in the Time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. Let this be as it will, it is certain that he had, whether by Learning, or by Strength of Genius, (tho' the latter be more glorious for <HI>Homer</HI>) a full and exact Idea of Painting in all its Parts; that is to &s;ay, in the <HI>Invention,</HI> the <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> the <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Invention</HI> is &s;hewn in finding and introducing, in every Subject, the <HI>greate&s;t,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ignificant,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>&s;uitable</HI> Objects. Accordingly in every &s;ingle Picture of the Shield, <HI>Homer</HI> con&s;tantly finds out either tho&s;e Objects which are naturally the Principal, tho&s;e which mo&s;t conduce to &s;hew the Subject, or tho&s;e which &s;et it in the livelie&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable Light: The&s;e he never fails to di&s;po&s;e in the mo&s;t advantagious Manners, Situations, and Oppo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>Next, we find all his Figures differently <HI>characterized,</HI> in their Expre&s;&s;ions and Attitudes, according to their &s;everal Natures: The Gods (for in&s;tance) are di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Air, Habit, and Proportion, from Men, in the fourth Picture; Ma&s;ters from Servants, in the eighth; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Nothing is more wonderful than his exact Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Contra&s;t,</HI> not only between Figure and Figure, but between Subject and Subject. The City in Peace is a Con|tra&s;t to the City in War: Between the Siege in the fourth Picture, and the Battel in the &s;ixth, a piece of Pai&s;age is introduced, and rural Scenes follow after. The Country too is repre&s;ented in War in the fifth, as well as in Peace in the &s;eventh, eighth, and ninth. The very Animals are &s;hewn in the&s;e two different States, in the tenth and the eleventh. Where the Subjects appear the &s;ame, he contra&s;tes them &s;ome other way: Thus the fir&s;t Picture of the Town in Peace having a predominant Air of Gaiety, in the Dances and Pomps of the Marriage; the &s;econd has a Character of Earne&s;tne&s;s and Sollicitude, in the Di&s;pute and Pleadings. In the Pieces of rural Life, that of the Plowing is of a different Character from the Harve&s;t, and that of the Harve&s;t from the Vin|tage. In each of the&s;e there is a Contra&s;t of the <HI>Labour</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="142">
and <HI>Mirth</HI> of the country People: In the fir&s;t, &s;ome are plowing, others taking a Cup of good Liquor; in the next, we &s;ee the Reapers working in one part, and the Banquet prepar'd in another; in the la&s;t, the Labour of the Vine|yard is reliev'd with Mu&s;ick and a Dance. The Per&s;ons are no le&s;s varied, Old and Young, Men and Women: There being Women in two Pictures together, namely the eighth and ninth, it is remarkable that tho&s;e in the latter are of a different Character from the former; they who dre&s;s the Sup|per being ordinary Women, the others who carry Baskets in the Vineyard, young and beautiful Virgins: And the&s;e again are of an inferior Character to tho&s;e in the twelfth Piece, who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd as People of Condition by a more elegant Dre&s;s. There are three Dances in the Buckler; and the&s;e too are varied: That at the Wedding is in a circular Fi|gure, that of the Vineyard in a Row, that in the la&s;t Picture, a mingled one. La&s;tly, there is a manife&s;t Contra&s;t in the Colours; nay, ev'n in the Back-Grounds of the &s;everal Pieces: For Example, that of the Plowing is of a dark Tinct, that of the Harve&s;t yellow, that of the Pa&s;ture green, and the re&s;t in like manner.</P>
<P>That he was not a Stranger to Aerial <HI>Per&s;pective,</HI> appears in his expre&s;ly marking the Di&s;tance of Object from Object: He tells us, for in&s;tance, that the two Spies lay a little re|mote from the other Figures; and that the Oak under which was &s;pread the Banquet of the Reapers, &s;tood apart. What he &s;ays of the Valley &s;prinkled all over with Cottages and Flocks, appears to be a De&s;cription of a large Country in Per&s;pective. And indeed a general Argument for this may be drawn from the Number of Figures on the Shield; which could not be all expre&s;s'd in their full Magnitude: And this is therefore a &s;ort of Proof that the Art of le&s;&s;ening them according to Per&s;pective was known at that Time.</P>
<P>What the Criticks call the <HI>three Unities,</HI> ought in rea&s;on as much to be ob&s;erved in a Picture as in a Play; each &s;hould have only <HI>one principal Action,</HI> one <HI>In&s;tant of Time,</HI> and one <HI>Point of View.</HI> In this Method of Examination al&s;o, the Shield of <HI>Homer</HI> will bear the Te&s;t: He has been more exact than the greate&s;t Painters, who have often deviated from one or

<P>Fir&s;t, that there is but one principal Action in each Pi|cture, and that no &s;upernumerary Figures or Actions are in|troduced. This will an&s;wer all that has been &s;aid of the Con|fu&s;ion and Crowd of Figures on the Shield, by tho&s;e who never comprehended the Plan of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, that no Action is repre&s;ented in one Peice, which could not happen in the &s;ame In&s;tant of Time.

But the cele&s;tial Bodies were placed on the Bo&s;s, as the Ocean at the Margin of the Shield: The&s;e were no Parts of the Painting, but the former was only an Ornament to the Projection in the middle, and the latter a Frame round about it: In the &s;ame manner as the Divi&s;ions, Projections, or Angles of a Roof are left to be ornamented at the Di&s;cretion of the Painter, with Fo|liage, Architecture, Grote&s;que, or what he plea&s;es: How|ever his Judgment will be &s;till more commendable, if he contrives to make even the&s;e extrin&s;ical Parts, to bear &s;ome Allu&s;ion to the main De&s;ign: It is this which <HI>Homer</HI> has done, in placing a &s;ort of Sphere in the middle, and the Ocean at the Border, of a Work, which was expre&s;&s;ly intend|ed to repre&s;ent the Univer&s;e.</P>

Deceas'd to watch his Corps, and prevent any Corruption before the &s;olemn Day of his Funerals. It is plain this De|voir was thought an indi&s;pen&s;able one, &s;ince <HI>Achilles</HI> could not di&s;charge him&s;elf of it but by impo&s;ing it upon his Mo|ther. It is al&s;o clear, that in tho&s;e times the Pre&s;ervation of a dead Body was accounted a very important Matter, &s;ince the Godde&s;&s;es them&s;elves, nay the mo&s;t delicate of the God|de&s;&s;es, made it the Subject of their utmo&s;t Attention. As <HI>Thetis</HI> pre&s;erves the Body of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and cha&s;es from it tho&s;e In|&s;ects that breed in the Wounds and cau&s;e Putrefaction, &s;o <HI>Venus</HI> is employ'd Day and Night about that of <HI>Hector,</HI> in driving away the Dogs to which <HI>Achilles</HI> had expos'd it. <HI>Apollo,</HI> on his part, covers it with a thick Cloud, and pre|&s;erves its Fre&s;hne&s;s amid&s;t the greate&s;t Heats of the Sun: And this Care of the Deities over the Dead was look'd upon by Men as a Fruit of their Piety.</P>
<P>There is an excellent Remark upon this Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>'s admirable Treati&s;e of the Epic Poem, lib. 3. c. 10. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To &s;peak (&s;ays this Author) of the Arts and Sciences as a Poet ought, we &s;hould veil them under Names and Actions of Per&s;ons fictitious and allegorical. <HI>Homer</HI> will not plainly &s;ay that Salt has the Virtue to pre&s;erve dead Bodies, and prevent the Flies from engendering Worms in them; he will not &s;ay, that the Sea pre&s;ented <HI>Achilles</HI> a Remedy to pre|&s;erve <HI>Patroclus</HI> from Putrefaction; but he will make the Sea a Godde&s;s, and tell us, that <HI>Thetis</HI> to comfort <HI>Achil|les,</HI> engaged to perfume the Body with an Ambro&s;ia which &s;hou'd keep it a whole Year from Corruption: It is thus <HI>Homer</HI> teaches the Poets to &s;peak of Arts and Scien|ces. This Example &s;hews the Nature of the things, that Flies cau&s;e Putrefaction, that Salt pre&s;erves Bodies from it; but all this is told us poetically, the whole is reduced into Action, the Sea is made a Per&s;on who &s;peaks and acts, and this <HI>Pro&s;opopoeia</HI> is accompanied with Pa&s;&s;ion, Tenderne&s;s and Affection; in a word, there is nothing which is not (according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Precept) endued with Manners.</Q></P>

<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;ame Critick upon the&s;e &s;ort of Re|petitions in general, de&s;erves to be tran&s;cribed. That u&s;ele&s;s Nicety (&s;ays he) of avoiding every Repetition which the Delicacy of later Times has introduced, was not known to the fir&s;t Ages of Antiquity: The Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> abound with them. Far from condemning their frequent U&s;e in the mo&s;t ancient of all the Poets, we &s;hould look upon them as the certain Character of the Age in which he liv'd: They &s;poke &s;o in his Time, and to have &s;poken otherwi&s;e had been a Fault. And indeed nothing is in it&s;elf &s;o contrary to the true Sublime, as that painful and frivolous Exactne&s;s, with which we avoid to make u&s;e of a proper Word becau&s;e it was us'd before. It is certain that the <HI>Romans</HI> were le&s;s &s;crupulous as to this point: You have often in a &s;ingle Page of <HI>Tully,</HI> the &s;ame Word five or &s;ix times over. If it were really a Fault, it is not to be conceiv'd how an Author who &s;o little wanted Variety of Expre&s;&s;ions as <HI>Homer,</HI> could be &s;o very negligent herein? On the contrary, he &s;eems to have affected to repeat the &s;ame Things in the &s;ame Words, on many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="183">
It was from two Principles equally true, that among &s;eve|ral People, and in &s;everal Ages, two Practices entirely diffe|rent took their Ri&s;e. <HI>Mo&s;es, Homer,</HI> and the Writers of the fir&s;t Times, had found that Repetitions of the &s;ame Words recall'd the Ideas of Things, imprinted them much more &s;trongly, and render'd the Di&s;cour&s;e more intelligible. Upon this Principle, the Cu&s;tom of repeating Words, Phra&s;es, and even entire Speeches, in&s;en&s;ibly e&s;tabli&s;h'd it&s;elf both in Pro&s;e and in Poetry, e&s;pecially in Narrations.</P>
<P>The Writers who &s;ucceeded them ob&s;erv'd, even from <HI>Ho|mer</HI> him&s;elf, that the greate&s;t Beauty of Style con&s;i&s;ted in Variety. This they made their Principle: They therefore avoided Repetitions of Words, and &s;till more of whole Sen|tences; they endeavour'd to vary their Tran&s;itions; and found out new Turns and Manners of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Things.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e Practices is good, but the Exce&s;s of either vicious: We &s;hould neither on the one hand, thro' a Love of Simplicity and Clearne&s;s, continually repeat the &s;ame Words, Phra&s;es, or Di&s;cour&s;es; nor on the other, for the Plea&s;ure of Variety, fall into a childi&s;h Affectation of expre&s;&s;ing every thing twenty different Ways, tho' it be never &s;o natu|ral and common.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;o much cools the Warmth of a Piece or puts out the Fire of Poetry, as that perpetual Care to vary in|ce&s;&s;antly even in the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tances. In this, as in many other Points, <HI>Homer</HI> has de&s;pis'd the ungrateful Labour of too &s;crupulous a Nicety. He has done like a great Painter, who does not think him&s;elf oblig'd to vary all his Pieces to that degree, as not one of 'em &s;hall have the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance to another: If the principal Figures are entirely different, we ea&s;ily excu&s;e a Re&s;emblance in the Land&s;capes, the Skies, or the Draperies. Suppo&s;e a Gallery full of Pictures, each of which repre&s;ents a particular Subject: In one I &s;ee <HI>Achilles</HI> in Fury, menacing <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> in another the &s;ame Hero with regret delivers up <HI>Bri&s;eis</HI> to the Heralds; in a third 'tis &s;till <HI>Achilles,</HI> but <HI>Achilles</HI> overcome with Grief, and lament|ing to his Mother. If the Air, the Ge&s;ture, the Counte|nance, the Character of <HI>Achilles,</HI> are the &s;ame in each of
<PB N="185" REF="184">
the&s;e three Pieces; if the Ground of one of the&s;e be the &s;ame with that of the others in the Compo&s;ition and general De|&s;ign, whether it be Land&s;cape, or Architecture; then indeed one &s;hould have rea&s;on to blame the Painter for the Uni|formity of his Figures and Grounds. But if there be no Same|ne&s;s but in the Folds of a few Draperies, in the Structure of &s;ome part of a Building, or in the Figure of &s;ome Tree, Mountain, or Cloud, it is what no one would regard as a Fault.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Book is entirely different from all the fore|going: Tho' it be a Battel, it is entirely of a new and &s;urprizing kind, diver&s;ify'd with a va&s;t Variety of Imagery and De&s;cription. The Scene is totally chang'd, he paints the Combate of his Hero with the Rivers, and de&s;cribes a Battel amid&s;t an Inundation. It is ob&s;ervable that tho' the whole War of the Iliad was upon the Banks of the&s;e Rivers, <HI>Homer</HI> has artfully left out the Machinery of River-Gods in all the other Battels, to aggran|dize this of his Hero. There is no Book of the Poem that has more force of Imagination, or in which the great and inexhau&s;ted Invention of our Author is more powerfully exerted. After this De&s;cription of an Inundation, there fol|lows a very beautiful Contra&s;t in that of the Drought: The Part of <HI>Achilles</HI> is admirably &s;u&s;tain'd, and the new Strokes which <HI>Homer</HI> gives to his Picture are &s;uch as are deriv'd from the very &s;ource of his Character, and fini&s;h the entire Draught of this Hero.</P>
<P>How far all that appears wonderful or extravagant in this Epi&s;ode, may be reconcil'd to Probability, Truth, and na|tural

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 14. <HI>As the &s;corch'd Locu&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob|&s;erves that &s;everal Countries have been much infe&s;ted with Armies of Locu&s;ts; and that, to prevent their de&s;troying the Fruits of the Earth, the Countrymen by kindling large Fires drove them from their Fields; the Locu&s;ts to avoid the in|ten&s;e Heat were forc'd to ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Water. From this Ob&s;ervation the Poet draws his Allu&s;ion which is very much to the Honour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;ince it repre&s;ents the <HI>Trojans</HI> with re&s;pect to him as no more than &s;o many In&s;ects.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Commentator takes notice, that becau&s;e the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus</HI> in particular was us'd to practi&s;e this Method with the Locu&s;ts, &s;ome Authors have conjectur'd that <HI>Homer</HI> was of that Country; but if this were a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, he might be &s;aid to be born in almo&s;t all the Countries of the World, &s;ince he draws his Ob&s;ervations from the Cu&s;toms of them all.</P>
<P>We may hence account for the innumerable Armies of the&s;e Locu&s;ts, mention'd among the Plagues of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> without having recour&s;e to an immediate Creation, as &s;ome good Men have imagin'd, whereas the Miracle indeed con|&s;i&s;ts in the wonderful manner of bringing them upon the <HI>Aegy|ptians:</HI> I have often ob&s;erv'd with Plea&s;ure the Similitude which many of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ions bear with the holy Scri|ptures, and that the olde&s;t Writer in the World except <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>

often &s;peaks in the Idiom of <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> Thus as the Locu&s;ts in <HI>Exodus</HI> are &s;aid to be driven into <HI>the Seas,</HI> &s;o in <HI>Homer</HI> they are forc'd into <HI>a River.</HI></P>

There happen'd a great Overflow of the River <HI>Xanthus</HI> during the Seige, which very much in|commoded the A&s;&s;ailants: This gave occa&s;ion for the Fiction of an Engagement between <HI>Achilles</HI> and the River-God: <HI>Xanthus</HI> calling <HI>Simois</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, implies that the&s;e two neighbouring Rivers join'd in the Inundation: <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Neptune</HI> relieve <HI>Achilles;</HI> that is, <HI>Pallas,</HI> or the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> found &s;ome means to divert the Waters, and turn them into the <HI>Sea;</HI> wherefore <HI>Neptune,</HI> the God of it, is feign'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> (by which are un|der&s;tood the aerial Regions) con&s;ent to aid <HI>Achilles;</HI> this may &s;ignify, that after this great Flood their happen'd a warm, dry, windy Sea&s;on, which a&s;&s;waged the Waters, and dried the Ground: And what makes this in a manner plain, is, that <HI>Juno</HI> (which &s;ignifies the <HI>Air</HI>) promi&s;es to &s;end the

<HI>North</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Winds</HI> to di&s;tre&s;s the River. <HI>Xanthus</HI> being con&s;um'd by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> that is dried up with Heat, prays to <HI>Juno</HI> to relieve him: What is this, but that the Drought having almo&s;t drunk up his Streams, he has recour&s;e to the <HI>Air</HI> for Rains to re&s;upply his Current? Or perhaps the whole may &s;ignify no more, than that <HI>Achilles</HI> being on the farther &s;ide of the River, plung'd him&s;elf in to pur&s;ue the Enemy; that in this Adventure he run the risk of being drown'd; that to &s;ave him&s;elf he laid hold on a fallen Tree, which &s;erv'd to keep him afloat; that he was &s;till carried down the Stream to the Place where was the Confluence of the two Rivers, which is expre&s;s'd by the one calling the other to his Aid; and that when he came nearer the Sea [<HI>Neptune</HI>] he found means by his Prudence <HI>(Pallas)</HI> to &s;ave him&s;elf from his Danger.</P>
<P>If the Reader &s;till &s;hould think the Fiction of Rivers &s;peak|ing and fighting is too bold, the Objection will vani&s;h by con&s;idering how much the Heathen Mythology authorizes the Repre&s;entation of Rivers as Per&s;ons: Nay even in old Hi&s;to|rians nothing is more common than Stories of Rapes com|mitted by River-Gods: And the Fiction was no way unpre|&s;idented, after one of the &s;ame nature &s;o well known, as the Engagement between <HI>Hercules</HI> and the River <HI>Achelous.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> gives the rea&s;on why <HI>Apollo</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts the <HI>Trojans,</HI> tho' he had been equally with <HI>Neptune</HI> affronted by <HI>Laome|don:</HI> This proceeded from the Honours which <HI>Apollo</HI> re|ceiv'd from the Po&s;terity of <HI>Laomedon; Troy</HI> paid him no le&s;s Wor&s;hip than <HI>Cilla,</HI> or <HI>Tenedos;</HI> and by the&s;e means won him over to a Forgivene&s;s: But <HI>Neptune</HI> &s;till was &s;lighted, and con&s;equently continued an Enemy to the whole Race.</P>

The &s;ame Author gives us various Opinions why <HI>Neptune</HI> is &s;aid to have built the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wall, and to have been de|frauded of his Wages: Some &s;ay that <HI>Laomedon</HI> &s;acrilegiou&s;ly took away the Trea&s;ures out of the Temples of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Neptune,</HI> to carry on the Fortifications: From whence it was fabled that <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> built the Walls. Others will have it, that two of the Workmen dedicated their Wages to <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Neptune;</HI> and that <HI>Laomedon</HI> detained them: So that he might in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be &s;aid to defraud the Deities them&s;elves, by with-holding what was dedicated to their Temples.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why <HI>Apollo</HI> is &s;aid to have kept the Herds of <HI>Laomedon</HI> is not &s;o clear: <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves that all Plagues fir&s;t &s;eize upon the four-footed Creation, and are &s;uppos'd to ari&s;e from this Deity: Thus <HI>Apollo</HI> in the fir&s;t Book &s;ends the Plague into the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army: The Ancients therefore made him to pre&s;ide over Cattel, that by pre&s;erving them from the Plague, Mankind might be &s;afe from infectious Di&s;ea&s;es. Others tell us, that this Employment is a&s;crib'd to <HI>Apollo,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;ignifies the Sun: Now the Sun cloaths the Pa&s;tures with Gra&s;s and Herbs: So that <HI>Apollo</HI> may be &s;aid him&s;elf to feed the Cattel, by &s;upplying them with Food. Upon either of the&s;e accounts <HI>Laomedon</HI> may be &s;aid to be ungrateful to that Deity, for rai&s;ing no Temple to his Honour.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that <HI>Homer</HI> in this Story a&s;cribes the build|ing of the Wall to <HI>Neptune</HI> only: I &s;hould conjecture the rea&s;on might be, that <HI>Troy</HI> being a Sea-port Town, the chief Strength of it depended upon its Situation, &s;o that the Sea was in a manner a Wall to it: Upon this account <HI>Neptune</HI> may not improbably be &s;aid to have built the Wall.</P>

<P>Here again there was need of another <HI>Machine</HI> to hinder him from entring the City; for <HI>Achilles</HI> being va&s;tly &s;peedier than tho&s;e he pur&s;ued, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily overtake &s;ome of them, and the narrow Gates could not let in a body of Troops without his mingling with the hindmo&s;t.
